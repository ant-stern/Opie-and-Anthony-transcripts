<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast following the 2012 Presidential election began with the hosts expressing outrage and using highly offensive racial slurs in their reaction to Obama's reelection. They dissected the election results state-by-state, focusing on urban populations and criticizing Obama's policies and supporters with further racially charged language.  Their anger extended to the perceived slow response to Hurricane Sandy by LIPA and FEMA, recounting their personal experiences with power outages and gas shortages. They also mocked Mitt Romney and Obama's concession speeches, Jesse Jackson Jr.'s election from a mental institution,  and the reactions of celebrities like Michael Moore and Sarah Silverman, as well as Donald Trump's call for a revolution and the legalization of marijuana in some states.  They also criticized Mitt Romney’s campaign strategy and Vince McMahon's financial losses due to his wife's unsuccessful political campaign.

The show continued with further discussion of the election’s surprisingly close margin and delayed announcements by news networks.  They mocked Karl Rove's inaccurate prediction and Diane Sawyer's alleged intoxication.  The racially offensive language continued, escalating with heated exchanges with callers, one expressing anger at Cumia's stated preference for a white president.  Several audio clips were played, including a local news reporter's on-air lapse, an interview with a Black woman in Baton Rouge seemingly voting for Obama solely based on race, and an intoxicated radio personality, Frankie Blue. They also discussed a fired bus driver and a caller's anecdote about a Burger King conversation regarding the election.

A substantial portion focused on racial demographics in voting patterns, with heated debates about whether race overwhelmingly influenced voting choices for Obama and Romney.  Callers contributed to the discussion, including a Black woman from Texas calling Obama a "token nigger," and a Hispanic man from Texas stating he didn't vote for Romney because he was white.  Another caller, a Black man, stated his Black parents didn't vote for Obama.  The hosts further discussed the lack of prominent Black Republican candidates and criticized Republican strategies.

Comedian Colin Quinn joined the show in studio, followed by Louis C.K.  Louis C.K.'s appearance covered his recent *Saturday Night Live* hosting experience, including anecdotes about Lorne Michaels, sketch choices, his monologue, and his preparation process. He also detailed his Emmy wins, his decision to take time off, and, extensively, his humorous boat mishap in the Harlem River involving his daughters, unhelpful police, and his recognition by onlookers.  The boat, named "DawgZ," was later damaged in a hurricane.  The conversation also included Anthony's generator issues, the severity of Hurricane Sandy compared to Katrina, an anecdote about a man confronting Louis C.K. about a joke, a listener comparing his boating mishap to Sully's Hudson River landing, a mysterious object near the Statue of Liberty, Anthony's comments on Staten Island, Jimmy's alleged encounter with a prostitute, a bit involving “Uncle Paul,” and Anthony's workout routine.

The final segment shifted to discussions about the careers and experiences of several comedians, including reflections on the hosts' own journeys and the differences in their comedic approaches.  Anecdotes about past show segments with David Lynch and Gary Marshall were shared.  A significant portion detailed plans for a new show on the Opie and Anthony channel, initially titled "Bageling with the Sex," then "Bageling with the N-word," finally settling on "Afternoon Delight," to be hosted by Eric Nagel ("E-Rock"), featuring food reviews by Roland.  The segment concluded with the hosts assigning roles and responsibilities for the new show, with frequent interruptions, vulgar language, and listener calls, some tense and disruptive.  Several on-air personalities, including Opie, Anthony, Jay Moore, and Eric Nagel, participated throughout this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  We got our Kevlar on today.  Nah, I can't.  We got our Kevlar on.  I, uh, I know what people are expecting.  Um, I just can't.  I can't sit here and just keep yelling again and again.  Obviously, it doesn't do any good.  I mean, that's been proven. 
[00:00:30]  And it just, uh, it hurts my voice.  So, um, so, uh...  So we stop talking about politics, hopefully?  Thank God, yes.  Um, yeah, well, Obama, once again, elected president.  Four more years.  Uh, the House and the Senate pretty much stay the same.  Uh, total gridlock.  No, no, this time they're gonna work together.  Oh, they're gonna work together?  No, they're nice.  They said that last night. 
[00:01:00]  They all gonna just work together.  Total gridlock.  Fucking, uh, no, nothing, nothing will get done, really, aside from the shit that Obama slips through.  Um...  Executive order shit?  Executive order stuff.  His little shenanigans he's been pulling.  I don't know.  Well, it's kind of a double-edged sword.  It's kind of a half-full, half-empty kind of a thing, because, um, with Obama in office for another four years, it really is gonna show what he can do and can't do.  Uh, his, uh, his weaknesses will be exposed. 
[00:01:30]  There's just, if I hear one Democrat blame George W. Bush for anything now, anything, I'm just gonna yell racial epithets into their face, like I was all night and all morning.  Were you losing your mind?  Dude, dude, I was an N-bomb-dropping motherfucker all day.  When did you realize that, uh, this thing was over?  Uh, when they called Ohio, really.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  I mean, I, I kinda knew, I lost any hope when, uh, Pennsylvania went.  Mm-hmm.  Because, I mean, Romney was campaigning hard in Pennsylvania.  They're supposedly, you know, all the coal workers and, and, you know, your blue-collar guys and stuff.  Um, heavily union, though, so, I mean, and again, Philly.  Just fucks Pennsylvania because the moron, mindless, fucking, I gotta watch what I say.  I gotta watch what I say.  But, but that's what I'm saying.  And everybody knows. 
[00:02:30]  The good thing about me is I've, I've said it, I've said things so many times that I don't even have to say it.  Everyone knows what I mean.  And if you have an inkling that you might think you know what I'm saying, yes, that's what I'm saying.  There's a certain element of people that have been ravaged economically in the past four years worse than anybody else.  And they're the ones celebrating the most.  They're so stupid.  They're so fucking stupid that they'd rather look at this man, but with, with an emotional attachment instead of any fucking reasonable thought with the shitty situation they're in economically. 
[00:03:00]  And think that perhaps the president should have a business mentality.  Perhaps the president should be somebody that we bring in now when we're economically fucked.  That has run businesses and knows perhaps how to put in a certain, um, things into this country that will build the economy up and build jobs up. 
[00:03:30]  But no, they look at this man.  They see that he looks similar to them and that's their excitement.  So they jump around and dance in the streets.  Well, all the while their unemployment is twice that of fucking the national level.  The poverty level is out of fucking control.  And yet they're happy that this fucking guy is in for four more years. 
[00:04:00]  Well, you got a motherfuckers.  Enjoy four more years, four more years.  Enjoy it because you're going to be even more fucking destitute.  Because let me tell you, the people that you've been sapping off of for this four years are done.  How did Ron, how did Romney, how did he lose Massachusetts?  That's a fucking, that's a democratic fucking state.  Yeah, but, but he won the government, being a governor there.  It's like, it's different than the presidential election.  Wow.  He lost Michigan too. 
[00:04:30]  Democratic fucking state.  Why was he supposed to win Michigan?  He had roots in Michigan.  Well, Detroit, motherfucker.  Detroit!  It's a sprinkling, let me tell you what happens to these states.  You can have a state where, where there's a fuckload of fucking red in there and just a couple of little patches of blue.  But then the whole state goes for the fucking blue side because it's the urban areas, the high populated areas in these important states.  So you can have a state in the middle of America where the entire state goes red. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  But they got three electoral votes.  Right.  But then you get a highly populated state because of the urban areas.  And now you get this small minority of people, which is growing leaps and bounds every year, mind you.  And they get to choose the election because they have the urban areas and the high populated areas in these states that have a lot of seats because of these populated areas.  It's amazing.  I remember hearing over the years that the white majority is, we're losing the white majority and Hispanics and blacks are coming up and the whites will be the minority over time. 
[00:05:30]  And you always thought like, well, what's that going to do?  What's that going to be like when the shift does happen?  Right.  Well, we're looking at it right now.  We're getting people that are voting for people in office based purely on the color of their skin, on emotion.  I mean, Jesse Jackson Jr. won his election from a mental institution, from a fucking mental institution. 
[00:06:00]  And he won because his stupid constituency looks at his skin.  You know, if people want to think you're crazy, you just fucking blow it around.  Holy mother of fuck!  He just brought it around.  Jesus Christ!  And he has no water!  No water!  No clean water!  Water! 
[00:06:30]  By the way, I'm going on like day nine without power also, so it's just, I look around, I say, like, what's happening?  Where the fuck is, is, uh...  LIPA?  LIPA.  It's LIPA in your area.  And the government agency.  I mean, I don't need government agency help.  Thank God I'm doing good enough to...  But if I was, I'd be fucked, just like most of the people out on Long Island and Jersey.  What I was telling you before the show, you're not in an area that was devastated. 
[00:07:00]  Tree-wise, yeah.  But your area should be an easy fix.  You'd think.  A very easy fix.  You'd think.  You know, I understand why no one in the Rockaways has power at this point.  Yeah.  But where you live, Mid-Island.  I know.  Now you're up to nine days without power.  That's just insane.  Nine fucking days.  That's insane.  Nine days.  I had to MacGyver my fucking heat, so I got heat.  It was just getting fucking freezing.  Well, and now we got a fucking snowstorm.  I know.  This nor'easter is bringing snow. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Long Island's going to get fucking hit again.  Yeah, it's moved a little further east than they said, so Long Island's going to get the  fucking brunt of it, and it's going to bring more colder air down.  So we're going to wind up getting some snow, mostly west and north, but we're going to  get some shitty weather.  And we're going to get some wet shit, and with the already weakened branches and trees,  wet snow on them.  Jesus fuck, man.  So what's going to happen to Leip after they take care of this whole situation?  We'll just go back to business as usual, right?  Nothing.  Shouldn't we be dragging the executives into the street? 
[00:08:00]  Something.  It's all about band-aids.  You were telling me that people in your neighborhood are now putting up signs?  Huge signs?  Yes.  I drove home and saw three houses with giant fucking signs on these white pieces of wood  that they have nailed to whatever trees are still standing in their yard.  Right.  And one said, eight days without power, heat, nothing.  And in giant letters in front of their house, like they're just so frustrated they have to  tell somebody.  Right.  Like at least I got a radio show.  They just have to put a sign in their yard. 
[00:08:30]  People are pissed.  That's their radio show.  The gas lines?  Right.  Still.  Yesterday there was fucking Nassau County cops came swooping in to the gas station near  my house when a tanker truck pulled up and started dumping fuel in.  Right.  And people just like ants, like locusts, just swarmed on this station.  And Nassau had to come in and start directing traffic, stopping fights, people yelling at each  other.  And I was going to wait for gas, but I couldn't.  So what the fuck are they saying? 
[00:09:00]  When is the power going on?  Well, when you listened to Bloomberg yesterday, he was talking and saying, I would have thought  that the gas would have gotten to where it needs to be.  Quite frankly, I'm just hoping, you know, it's going to one day you will wake up and  it will be better.  He said that's his explanation.  One day you'll wake up and it'll be better.  That's good.  I mean, you wake up freezing.  You wake up fucking.  We could have said that.  Yeah.  You're the mayor.  We could have said that.  I could say, well, one day I'll wake up and there'll be gas. 
[00:09:30]  No, the gas lines are still insane.  And now I'm at the point again where I'm looking at my gas gauge.  I'm looking at my gas cans.  And today, at some point today, I am going to have to venture out and find some fucking  gas.  And people go, boo hoo, poor Anthony.  You know, fuck your mother because it's a pain in the ass.  It's not poor Anthony.  I got family and we all can relate.  It's nine days of this shit so far and I've had it.  I mean, I can't relate.  I never lost power.  I didn't either.  And, you know, the AC was cranking again last night because the building's a little 
[00:10:00]  warm.  But I can relate because I got, like, family members that are going through what you're  going through.  You know, the West Side Highway last night, I was going southbound of the cellar.  It's the worst traffic I've ever seen in New York on the West Side Highway.  And it's all because of that.  They said the Hess Station and that whole area.  It's the Hess Station and the fact that there's no Holland.  Well, the Holland Tunnel opened up this morning.  But last night, there was no Holland Tunnel.  There's no battery tunnel.  So you're just backing everyone up.  A lot of these people, they're either going north to the fucking bridge or the Lincoln 
[00:10:30]  Tunnel.  It just seems that, I don't know, we should be further along in the recovery.  Yes.  Not in the Rockways and all these, and the Jersey Shore, obviously, but these regular neighborhoods.  Well, you know what?  No one is coming in.  No one's talking about FEMA.  No one's talking about the president hating white people, black people, whatever, like  they did with George W. Bush and blamed him for Katrina and all that happy horse shit.  So it just sits there. 
[00:11:00]  And time goes on and the country doesn't care.  You know, the big story around the country is the election.  Well, of course.  The big story here is the fact that we got a storm coming in, and there's still people  fucking homeless in rickety houses, in areas where trees are still falling on people's  heads.  A guy just died fucking yesterday, trying to clear his yard, and a tree fell on his head.  Jesus.  I mean, people are still dying from this shit.  And nothing is being done.  Can't you get out of the way of trees falling?  You'd think.  They'd fall slow, right? 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  Timber.  This election, though, me and Ann were talking for a while before the show, and it's a weird  process because as we all wake up this morning, you realize that half of the country is absolutely  not happy with this election.  When you hear Obama say the American people have spoken.  No, they haven't spoken.  Half of them have spoken.  Half of them are pissed.  This is where we're at in this country now.  The divided states of America.  There used to be a time where, you know, when the president was elected, there was a lot 
[00:12:00]  of times, way more than 50% of the people were happy.  At least something.  At this point, it's 50 people are happy, and 50% of the people are miserable with this  selection.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's our country, in a nutshell.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think that's good.  No.  I don't think that's good.  It's really strange.  And you can't be the one saying the people have spoken.  Absolutely not.  No, I mean, we're...  Half the people have spoken.  Did he mention...  I'm sorry.  52%?  We're more divided now than ever. 
[00:12:30]  I mean...  Did he mention how close it was, or no, Obama?  Well, we got his speeches.  We got a lot to do.  Did he mention it was that close?  Because they said he should have acknowledged that it was that close.  I didn't listen to it.  I watched the election like I watch the World Series when your team is losing, and it's that  last out, and it pops into the outfield, and the guy gets under the ball, and the people  start cheering, because they know they're going to win, and you know they're going to lose.  And the second the ball hits the guy's glove, and you know he made the catch, I fucking changed 
[00:13:00]  the channel.  Because I don't want to see the adulation or hear this shit.  Well, what do you want to do?  We got Romney and Obama.  We got some close.  Yeah, well, we got it.  Which one do you want to do first?  Well, I guess Romney gave his concession speech first, and then Obama gave his speech.  Thank God.  Is he thinking, what a waste of time that was?  Man.  Time and fucking money.  Time and money.  Down the shitter.  What a waste.  Oh, boy.  That all or nothing shit is intense. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  He gets nothing.  He doesn't even get a participation trophy.  Nothing.  I think his speech was good, though.  It wasn't that long, and I thought his concession speech was good, just like McCain's was four  years ago, I thought was very eloquent and nice.  They're all very magnanimous and very fucking, you know.  By Friday, no one will say his name at all.  No, he's back fucking just done.  Just being a Romney somewhere.  Ryan got re-elected to his seat.  Oh, nice.  So he just goes back to business.  And they didn't get Wisconsin either, did they?  No, no. 
[00:14:00]  But that was going to be a tough one, wasn't it?  That's always a tough one, but...  But they were hoping with Ryan on the ticket, that would help.  Yeah, yeah.  But it did not.  Well, you know what?  I also am grateful that racism is, you know, just one of those things now.  It's just one of those things that people have to deal with in this country.  Like everyone has their crosses to bear.  Every group of people, gays and stuff, and you just kind of get through it. 
[00:14:30]  Well, black people have got to now just deal with the fact that there will be racism.  There'll always be racism.  But obviously, it's not as bad as they think it is.  And any obstacles that are in your path aren't put there by a statewide racist government and entity  when a black man can be elected president not just once, like a fluke, but twice.  And over two white guys that would normally have looked like your stereotypical president and vice president. 
[00:15:00]  So when they can be elected, when Obama can be elected like this again, I am now completely done.  Completely done with catering to any black causes, being called a racist, any of these excuses that racism has come into play in their life  and they can't do this, can't do that, they're being blocked from this, that affirmative action. 
[00:15:30]  That all is done, and I mean this time, really fucking done.  I'm going to start, I'm going to start, if I want to use racial epithets, I'm just going to use them.  Because anyone else can, with any other group, congratulations black people, you made it.  You made it.  You're part of the country.  Congratulations.  You're now officially unfettered to do anything you want in this fucking nation.  And, oh, you're always going to have racists and racism, but it's just something that you've got to deal with. 
[00:16:00]  A bad part of the country, like I've got to deal with taxes, and I've got to deal with bullshit people sapping off of me.  You have to deal with a certain amount of hatred and racism based on your behavior, by the way.  But, congrats, you're in.  You're in.  Welcome.  Welcome to the club, black people.  Welcome.  Now, what happened to Jesse Jackson's son again?  He won office from a mental institution.  Bat shit crazy they elected him because of nothing but his name and the fact that his constituency looks like him. 
[00:16:30]  But that shouldn't be allowed.  It shouldn't.  Shouldn't they, shouldn't you have to pass some exams before you run?  If you're unstable, you should not even be allowed to be in it.  Could you find Craigslist if they're selling lawn jockeys?  I'm going to put one on my lawn.  Just for the hell of it.  You already have one.  I got a little one in the backyard. 
[00:17:00]  I want one of those big ones on each side of my driveway holding the lanterns.  Why don't you wait and you see what the Lipa guys look like who show up at your house?  Yeah, maybe the Lipa guys are.  Well, based on how long it's taken to fix my shit, you're probably right.  Here's Romney from last night.  I think Romney's fucked up because I kind of wanted to lie.  Last night I was kind of like, I hope Romney wins for tax purposes.  But then I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know.  George Bush, at least whether you hate him or love him, you knew who Bush was. 
[00:17:30]  Like you knew he's a religious conservative.  You know what he is.  This is what Bush hates abortion.  He hates this.  You knew it whether you like him or hate him.  With Romney, I had no fucking idea.  I don't think he would put out enough of what he's all about.  No, and it's because this dummy wasted too much time trying to convince other Republicans that he'd be heart-nosed, which was stupid.  They were never going to vote for Obama over him.  He fucked up.  That's true.  And that stupid video of him, even though I know it was taken out of context, but to get caught out there saying what he was saying, which seemed like a private moment, was dumb. 
[00:18:00]  It was, but he only alienated the people that were already not voting for him.  Probably right.  A lot of blacks, a lot of Hispanics voted for him.  A lot of these, the white guilt in this country, I'm so surprised it's still there.  I think if Obama continues for the next four years like he has been for the past four, there's going to be a big turnaround.  Because now everyone's like, all right, look, we're giving you another shot. 
[00:18:30]  We're going to give you the four years you've been asking for.  But, you know, no more blaming George W.  The unemployment rate's got to come down.  This economy's got to come back.  We've got to start producing and selling stuff again.  We can't let China steamroll over us.  We can't let other countries steamroll us.  We've got to present ourselves still as a strong nation.  And he's going to be under a microscope for this stuff.  You should look at it in a positive way.  This is your jumping off point. 
[00:19:00]  I'm done.  No, this is your chance to become a political talk show host.  Fuck that.  I'm so done with politics.  Did you hear the first 20 minutes of this show?  No, Fox is not going to hire that and go, all right, cool.  Because you didn't actually say it.  You said they look like him and they're dumb.  Right.  Exactly.  I went on a fucking blocking binge last night on Twitter, by the way.  I'm done.  So I'm done.  Like, during the 18 months of fucking campaigning we've had, or even longer, whatever it's been, 
[00:19:30]  I've started following a lot of people with opposing viewpoints politically, especially a lot of these celebrities and whatnot.  Michael Moore, Sarah Silverman.  You think he's happy today?  Oh, he's fucking ecstatic.  You think Sarah Silverman's very happy today?  Sarah Silverman's hairy pussy is smiling.  That big hairy fucking stank bush is smiling.  But every time I saw their tweets of adulation, block, block, any kind of ha-ha, Anthony.  And I've seen there are people that follow me, perhaps even fans of the show, block, block. 
[00:20:00]  I must have blocked hundreds of people, hundreds of people.  I blocked until Twitter said you can't block anymore in this 24-hour period.  I guess you're only allowed to block.  That happens?  Yes.  And I hit it.  You didn't notice from Twitter?  I didn't notice from Twitter.  I didn't hit it.  I didn't even know that was possible.  I hit the bell.  I hit the mark.  I bet that's in case, you know what?  I bet that's in case somebody hacks your account, they can't block everybody.  Probably.  They can't fuck you.  That's probably a fail set.  So you can start all over again today? 
[00:20:30]  I hit the mark.  Look, we got a lot to do.  Why don't we do some Romney here?  Sure.  Then we got some Obama stuff.  Then we got Donald Trump's tweets.  Then we got Diane Sawyer drunk.  It's all over the place today.  Lots to do.  Lots.  Here's Romney from last night.  I have just called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory.  I called him, too.  This is it.  By the way, this is the shit that I fucking hate about politics.  Oh, yeah.  18 months, they're like basically saying this guy is the fucking devil. 
[00:21:00]  He's the worst thing for the country.  Blah, blah, blah.  They've pretty much strangled each other.  And then the night of the election, it's all like, oh, I called him to congratulate him.  I fucking hate the phoniness of the whole thing.  It really is so funny.  Why do you have to be a sport in the end?  It's phony.  It is.  You're right.  Because it's all bullshit.  We don't believe this.  And what he's saying right there and what they all say is, I was either full of shit  now or I was full of shit when I was basketball.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why I hate this whole process because there's so much phoniness to it.  Do you know who's great? 
[00:21:30]  You fucking hate Obama and you think he's the worst thing for the country.  But now you're going to be the rah-rah guy?  For what reason?  And he was calling Romney, blatantly calling him a liar.  Right.  And now he's, you know, hey, great, great campaign.  Right.  Good man, Bob.  I have just called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory.  His supporters and his campaign also deserve congratulations.  Why, for bashing you?  I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady, and their daughters. 
[00:22:00]  Of course, this is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president  will be successful in guiding our nation.  See, that's a statement he doesn't believe.  No, no.  I wonder if the real people that run this country are backstage with a gun like, okay, now this  is what you have to do.  This is what you've got to say.  Now this is what you have to say.  We wrote it out for you.  Why can't the guy be honest at that point?  Like, I, you know, you guys, the people have spoken, you elected Obama, but I still think 
[00:22:30]  it's a bad idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think he's a good guy for the job.  That's what he believes.  Yeah.  He continues.  The nation, as you know, is at a critical point.  At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing.  Our leaders have to...  We just did that for 18 months.  Yeah.  Didn't we?  We just did that for 18 months.  18 long fucking months.  We just wasted 18 months.  But now we shouldn't do that anymore, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I fucking hate this shit.  Because it says, I've been lying to you up until yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Or I've been playing a game up until yesterday.  It's even worse when they do it in their own party.  Right.  Yes.  This, you know how he at least, you know he's opposite politically.  Right.  When they, when Democrats and Republicans do it to each other in primaries, how do you  fucking believe a word they say that's positive about each other ever again?  Then they turn around and go, well, you know, I'm out of the race now, but he is absolutely  the guy.  Yeah.  And then the guy appoints the guy he was beating the shit out of.  The worst was Newt Gingrich.  He beat the shit out of all his, all his guys there.  Yeah.  And he's on, he's been on all the news channels rah, rah, rying fucking Romney. 
[00:23:30]  He doesn't, he didn't believe it during the primaries.  He thought he was the, Romney was the worst choice for the party.  Yeah.  I fucking hate this shit because it's bullshit.  Do you know who said all this last night and who was amazingly fair?  It was Shep Smith on Fox.  I couldn't believe how good he was.  He's pretty good.  Talking about exactly this, how we're supposed to believe these guys when they bash each  other.  And he was bashing Romney too and Obama.  He was kind of Shepard.  Shepard's pretty good.  I really, I should have said Shepard to the Shep like I'm his fucking coworker. 
[00:24:00]  He's one of the guys on Fox I do watch.  I really liked him.  I watch him more than probably, probably any of them on Fox.  Yeah.  But, you know, but now it's time to bring the whole country together, even though we just  fucking tore each other apart for 18 months.  So stupid.  You know how much, you know how much stuff we could have got done in the last 18 months?  Yep.  Yeah, well.  Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.  And we citizens also have to rise to the occasion.  We look to our teachers and professors. 
[00:24:30]  We count on you not just to teach, but to inspire our children with a passion for learning and  discovery.  Oh, please.  We look to our pastors and priests and rabbis and counselors of all kinds to testify of  the enduring principles upon which our society is built.  Honesty.  Charity.  Honesty.  Integrity and family.  Yeah.  We look to our parents.  From the final analysis, everything depends on the success of our homes.  Okay.  We look to job creators of all kinds.  We're counting on you to invest, to hire, to step forward. 
[00:25:00]  And we look to Democrats and Republicans in government at all levels to put the people  before the politics.  I believe in America.  I believe in the people of America.  I don't.  By the way, a little side note.  Our app isn't working again.  Why would it?  Everyone is fucking losing their minds saying the fucking app's not working.  It's Obama.  Engineering knows they've been working on it since it started.  It's the third party. 
[00:25:30]  It's not from here.  Why do they have a third party who's not doing it?  I don't want to.  Well, I do want a third party, but I don't want a third party when it comes to our app.  Yeah.  Don't we have enough people in-house that could fucking be on that all the time?  There must be somebody at that third party that really just doesn't like the show.  There absolutely is.  Who loves to just cut us off because they can?  We've said that so many times, and nobody listens.  Nobody investigates that.  It absolutely happens.  Because we don't have the right guys running the channel.  Period.  Someone that doesn't like it.  And that's not a bitch, by the way, Sam.  It's just a fact. 
[00:26:00]  We don't have the right guys.  Do you know-  Because this is the only channel that the app goes out all the time.  All the time.  All the time.  All the time.  All the time.  All the fucking time.  All the time.  People love listening to this show on their phones.  Phones are really important right now in broadcasting.  Pressing a guy named Daryl Obama.  And we got an app that just goes out all the time.  Cousin Marvin Obama.  You know where else Romney fucked up on that last foreign policy debate? 
[00:26:30]  He did not look like he was-  And even though he said some smart stuff, but he did not look like he-  Even though the economy is what everybody said, but he didn't look like-  He didn't look president.  He looked great in the first one.  Second one, yeah, okay.  Not in, you know, fine.  But the third one, he didn't look good at all.  The foreign policy one.  He looked lost.  And it was the look on his face.  It was that half his smile.  It smirked.  He looked lost.  He was trying to bring it, every question, back around to domestic issues.  Yeah.  Because it's very hard for a former governor to really talk about foreign policy. 
[00:27:00]  I mean, the fact that he didn't have the experience of foreign policy, well, neither did Obama when he took office.  I don't think that should be the main thing in a debate.  It should be.  And it isn't-  Because it's not fair to the one guy that hasn't really done that yet.  Yeah.  It's just not fair.  And the truth of the matter is the economy was what everybody put as their number one thing.  So why would you vote for a guy that didn't do anything for the economy in four years?  It just languishes there instead of a businessman that, you know, might have done something. 
[00:27:30]  I'm not even saying he would have.  Here's your businessman.  One more clip from Romney's speech last night.  And I ran for office because I'm concerned about America.  This election is over.  But our principles endure.  Therefore, I believe that the principles upon which this nation was founded are the only  sure guide to a certain economy and to renewed greatness.  Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. 
[00:28:00]  We have given our all to this campaign.  Sure.  I so wish, I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in  a different direction.  Yeah.  But the nation chose another leader.  No, half the nation.  And so Anne and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation.  Thank you and God bless America.  He's earnest.  You guys are the best.  And earnestly go to camp. 
[00:28:30]  He ends with, you guys are the best.  Yeah.  Hey, thanks for nothing.  You guys are the best.  I'm just going to go back to the private sector.  Well, thanks for nothing.  Make all this money back that I fucking spent doing this shit.  Yeah, he'll make that back easily.  Ah, that's nothing.  No problem for him.  He should have been the moderate he was all along.  I'm telling you because that fucking trying to, I hate to say, kowtow to the, he had to  be a good model.  He's more of a moderate than a lot of conservatives are.  He's not a fucking hardcore religious Republican. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, he might have swayed some of the moderates.  Yes.  He's really not a scummy, horrible, heartless businessman.  And they took what he said about Detroit.  When he said bankrupt Detroit, didn't he mean then you can start over?  Go into bankruptcy protection.  But people don't hear that.  They hear bankrupt.  People don't know what bankrupt means.  They mean, let them go bankrupt.  Which they just picture the shutters being put on the windows of the factory.  And no, bankruptcy protection, like many companies, especially after 9-11, a lot of the airlines  did it and stuff.  That's what he meant. 
[00:29:30]  Just not a government bailout.  And government subsidies helping them get out of bankruptcy, but not backing them completely  with the government money.  And this is a mistake he made, I thought, by not going.  I know these are all talk shows like Letterman and The View, but there was a lot of opportunities  to have conversations in these places that are a little bit different than you have in  political forums.  Yeah.  Like, these are things he could have explained.  Sitting with these dummies on The View, they're not going to be blatantly rude to him.  Right.  He could have absolutely said, what I meant by that was this, and had plain language discussions 
[00:30:00]  with people.  And he would have seemed more relatable.  I told you, he fucked up by not doing that.  He's probably a much nicer guy than he came off of.  I don't think he knows that world.  I don't think he knows he would have been eaten alive by Letterman and some of these  other shows.  Pia Raps.  Pia Raps.  Maybe.  Just my hunch.  I don't know.  It is kind of a, though, for the Romney supporters out there that are devastated, I'm sure.  It is kind of a, but it is kind of a cut off your nose to spite your face thing, because  I hate the fact that I think this is bad for the country, but I do like the fact that 
[00:30:30]  he will be exposed now.  He will be exposed.  And this isn't paranoia talking.  He's a bad president.  He's not a good, especially on domestic issues and the economy.  The guy doesn't understand what this country needs to get back into the world market.  I don't think he does.  One of the guys that is devastated today is Donald Trump.  Yes.  Furious Trump calls for a revolution after disgusting injustice, sham, and travesty of 
[00:31:00]  Obama's re-election.  Go back to your casino and your fucking moments after the president's victory was projected  by several news outlets last night.  Trump took to Twitter to voice his outrage, demanding a revolution.  Yeah, that's what we get.  Trump demanding a revolution instead of if it went the other way, the fucking cities would  be burning today.  He also said that the Democrats' re-election to office was a great and disgusting injustice.  But how is it an injustice if he actually did get the popular vote and the Electoral  College by 103?  Or is it by 97? 
[00:31:30]  In all fairness, when he started tweeting, Romney was still ahead as far as the popular  vote goes.  Oh, really?  More votes equals a loss.  Revolution.  Let's fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice.  The world is laughing at us.  We can't let this happen.  We should march on Washington and stop this travesty.  It's the way the world laughs.  Our nation is totally divided.  Well, he should start marching and see who fucking joins him.  He's right about the country being divided.  It's very, very polarized right now. 
[00:32:00]  It's been divided for the last at least four years at this point.  Worse now than ever, even in four years.  Getting worse, sure.  But he didn't have more votes.  He should kick his down.  Well, I know.  Well, when he did tweet that, that was the case.  The phony Electoral College made a laughing stock out of our nation.  The loser won.  He lost a popular vote by a lot and won the election.  We should have a revolution in this country.  Well, back to the drawing board, he tweeted.  Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light. 
[00:32:30]  The truth is Obama won the popular vote.  George Washington.  That was George Washington.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  He won the popular vote.  Yeah.  I'm actually glad he won it because I hate when somebody – I think – didn't Clinton  get in with losing the popular vote?  Who got in?  Bush did.  Bush lost.  Bush over Gore.  Gore got the popular vote.  Gore got the popular vote by a half million.  Yeah.  Half a million more votes and he was not the president.  But I mean, it's like – is Trump complaining about that?  It's like, stop it.  I like – I want the guy to win the popular vote though. 
[00:33:00]  Like, I'm glad he won it because then I can't go, fuck, he lost the popular vote.  It's so close that it really is inconsequential as far as what it really means is like how  the American people feel.  Half the American people don't want this guy president.  Sure.  That's pretty much what this said.  When Reagan won, I think 49 states to one.  I wonder – can you look it up, Sam?  What the popular –  49 states to one.  Over Moynihan and – not Moynihan, Ferrara – no, no, no.  Geraldine Ferrara and –  Oh, God. 
[00:33:30]  I forgot.  Not Moynihan.  No, the other guy, fucking –  Walter Mondale.  Mondale, right.  I want to know what the popular vote was.  I'm sure Reagan won that too.  And what state did Mondale win?  Dude, I don't know.  Not his home state though.  Hello.  I'm going to guess something like New Hampshire or Maine or Vermont.  Something like –  He won –  50 –  Wisconsin.  No, Minnesota, Wisconsin.  What?  60 percent.  Montana.  No, what?  Oh, so he won – he got 60 percent.  60 percent of the popular vote Reagan got. 
[00:34:00]  That's it.  Yeah, I mean, 20 percent –  Even in a landslide like that.  That's a landslide though.  60 percent is huge.  Yeah, right.  You're really never going to get a –  But we haven't seen anyone come close to that since.  No, no.  49 to one.  What did he win?  What state did Mondale get?  That one over there.  Look at that.  Left of Illinois.  Left of Illinois.  Oh.  I was so wrong.  What state is that, Sam?  I can't see.  Read it.  The blue one.  Yeah, it doesn't have a name on it.  It's just 10.  Let me see it.  I'll show you.  I'll tell you what.  I know –  None of us know our geography.  Oh, I know that. 
[00:34:30]  What state is that?  I can't –  Oh, that's Iowa.  Iowa.  We just don't know our geography.  I get lost in the middle.  No, no.  That's Wisconsin.  In the middle of the fucking –  No, that's Idaho.  I said –  I said –  No, that –  Which one is it?  Why don't we know our geography?  We never need to look at maps anymore.  Maps are for fucking queers.  No, no.  That's –  I can pretty much do the whole East Coast, and then I could scrape along to Texas.  And then I can –  I know all the – all the way around the fucking perimeter. 
[00:35:00]  That's Minnesota.  You sure?  Yeah.  The middle is where it gets rough.  I don't know those states.  I got one.  All right.  Here's Obama.  Tonight, more than 200 years after a former president,  our colony won the right to determine its own destiny.  That's –  The task of perfecting our union moves forward.  That's –  It moves forward because of you. 
[00:35:30]  It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression,  the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope,  the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams,  we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people. 
[00:36:00]  I can't pursue my dreams with you in office.  I can't.  But that's not true.  You pursue your dreams and then you're just crucified for fucking achieving them.  52% are about that.  All right.  Reverend Al has to go to the hospital.  Could someone fucking just drive Reverend Al to the hospital?  What the fuck is wrong with him?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  I hope he's sick.  He looks –  He's not.  He got that lap band.  It's obvious.  Lap band?  He got that lap band shit. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, please be sick.  That looks like one of my Halloween decorations.  He looks awful.  He's terrible.  He looks like a rotting apple.  What else – when it comes to Obama, the one thing I didn't like and the one thing I did like about Romney  is I hate the fact that I'm going to pay more taxes.  I resent that.  I'm tired of hearing fair share.  I give my fair share.  But what else about him?  Like I'm trying to think like I didn't mind anything else about him other than the financial angle.  And that's a big one, but I can't think of other things that I didn't like.  He weakens the nation. 
[00:37:00]  He weakens – he's not a strong leader.  He weakens this nation in its image, its world image internationally.  He weakens it economically with his social programs that cost a fuckload of money and don't bring money in.  He's spending like a fuck on things that don't produce.  They don't pay back.  He's borrowing money to put his shit in place, and his shit does not pay off. 
[00:37:30]  That's the problem.  He's weakening this nation.  He's turning this nation into one of these socialist countries that don't really produce.  That's the problem with him.  He doesn't have a business-oriented mind.  He has a welfare-oriented mind.  He's betting on the impoverished to support him.  That's what he did.  How do you lose when your constituents are the people that receive your free shit? 
[00:38:00]  He's giving away stuff.  Of course they love him.  Fuck.  We'll just break all that down in four years from now and start over.  Yeah, perhaps.  Who do Republicans have?  You think, Ryan?  Oh, God, no.  Ken Run?  In four years?  Chris Christie.  Oh, yeah, maybe.  He would probably be the...  If Christie loses some fucking weight.  Yeah, that's a...  I'm telling you...  Fat president since, like, what?  Taft?  Yeah.  There's something about...  The go-to fat guy, Taft. 
[00:38:30]  We don't love Taft.  I think he should really play it up, and Christie should grow that big mustache.  I agree with me.  Big walrus mustache.  And we can never forget that, as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives  right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter, the chance to cast their  ballots like we did today.  But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. 
[00:39:00]  We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the  best teachers.  Union schools and teachers.  A country that...  Stop kissing the union's asses.  We get it.  We're a global leader in technology and discovery and innovation.  With all the good jobs and new businesses that follow.  Where? 
[00:39:30]  We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt.  That isn't weakened by inequality.  What?  That isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.  Oh.  Destructive power of the warming planet.  You fucking cunt.  No, it's really strange as you listen to this.  Didn't he say this four years ago?  Of course he did.  It's really strange that he was saying this last night.  Now he can talk about...  Last night should have been a different speech.  Dude, you could hear him.  Now he can talk about things like global warming. 
[00:40:00]  He...  Before the election, he wouldn't have mentioned global warming.  He would have hinted to it.  And now you're going to see the unaccountable Barack Hussein Obama.  You're going to see a guy that doesn't have to worry about a re-election.  And he's going to bring up shit like this.  Everyone was saying, you know, you still got to...  Keep your guns for the four years he was in.  Yeah, he didn't want to turn off the fucking gun lobby completely by going after the Second Amendment.  You're going to start seeing the unaccountable Barack Hussein Obama. 
[00:40:30]  But they say...  Someone raised the point that maybe at least one or maybe two more justices will be appointed in this next four years.  And I don't want an arch-conservative Supreme Court.  That was something I kind of am concerned about.  I don't want to...  I prefer a bit more of a liberal Supreme Court than an arch-conservative one.  I do not want that.  Yeah, that's...  I agree with you, Jimmy, on that.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, whatever.  I don't mind.  I don't mind things like abortion. 
[00:41:00]  Fuck it.  Rip them out.  Rip them the fuck out.  Because most of them are useless pieces of shit anyway.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  And gay marriage?  Good.  Fucking take your cock and shove it up your pal's asshole.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Please isolate that for the beginning of the show.  Get your cock and shove it up your pal's asshole.  It means nothing in the grand scheme of this country.  That shit doesn't mean anything.  Maine and Maryland became the seventh and eighth states to legalize same-sex marriage. 
[00:41:30]  Well, congratulations, homosexuals.  Congratulations.  You can now suck each other's cocks and eat each other's box in public and flaunt your wedding rings.  And your beautiful ball gowns.  Whatever you want to fucking do.  Get together.  Get married.  Be miserable like everyone else that's married.  Good.  Congrats.  By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won't end all the gridlock  or solve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus 
[00:42:00]  and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward.  But that common bond is where we must begin.  Our economy has recovered.  A decade of war is ending.  A long campaign is now over.  And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, shut up.  I have learned from you.  And you've made me a better president.  What?  And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined  and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.  Damn, that sounds good.  But it sounds...  That sounded good. 
[00:43:00]  It sounds very much like a politician's speech.  I would have preferred...  I just...  He doesn't rally the people to make...  He's not bringing the people together.  It sounds too much like he's trying.  When you had a president like Reagan, he absolutely was able to unite the nation, whether you agreed  with him or not.  Like, he was a no-nonsense kind of guy.  This just sounds like a political thing.  And you know damn well this president has proven over the past four years he is not a uniting  president.  Sorry. 
[00:43:30]  He's just not.  This country has more wealth than any nation.  Yeah.  But that's not what makes us rich.  Of course not.  We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us strong.  Well, wait till four years goes by.  Our university, our culture, are all the enemy of the world, but that's not what keeps  the world coming to our shores.  You'll fix that.  What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on  Earth.  Yuck.  The belief that our destiny is shared, that this country only works when we accept certain 
[00:44:00]  obligations to one another and the future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have  fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights.  And among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.  That's what makes America great.  You know what obligations to one another means? 
[00:44:30]  Do you know what obligations to one another means?  Is that good?  I don't want the government telling me I'm obliged to anything.  I agree.  I'm obliged to pay my taxes so the government can fix the shit I use in this country.  That's it.  I'm not obligated to help anyone.  I want to help my family.  I'm going to help my friends.  Of course I do.  And I do that too.  And I help perfect strangers sometimes.  I don't give a shit.  But I don't want to be obligated.  An obligation? 
[00:45:00]  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, that is kind of a...  That is a bit of a...  That's the one word.  As soon as I heard that, I'm like, that's what bugs me.  I don't like being told I'm not doing enough when I know I am.  And I'm okay to pay.  I don't mind paying taxes.  You just don't want to be told that you're not doing enough.  Dude, I don't want to be...  I agree with that point as well, Jimmy.  I don't want to be 50% partners with the fucking government.  When they're just throwing the money away also.  Yeah.  And then to have the people that you're giving your money to turn around and then tell you 
[00:45:30]  you're not doing enough.  Oh, man, is that fucking infuriating.  If I have a house guest, and I've said this before, have a house guest, let him fucking  be in your house and use your shit, and then have him turn around and go, you're a piece  of shit.  Why don't you give me more?  I want a bigger room.  I want...  You're like, motherfucker, I'm fucking supporting you.  You throw him out is what you'd do if it was your house.  Yeah.  That's a microcosm.  I believe we can keep the promise of our founding.  The idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, or where you 
[00:46:00]  come from, or what you look like, or where you love, it doesn't matter whether you're  black or white, or Hispanic, or Asian, or Native American, or young, or old, or rich,  or poor, or disabled, or poor, or disabled, gay, or straight.  Ah, shit, we're not going to be able to bully anymore.  Oh, that was to get gay or straight in, by the way.  Uh-huh, gay or straight.  You can make it here in America if you're willing to try.  Try America! 
[00:46:30]  America!  His black sense comes through now.  I hope we can seize this future together.  Because we are not as divided as our politics suggests.  We're not as cynical as the pundits believe.  Oh, yeah.  We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions.  And we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.  We are and forever will be the United States of America.  And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward. 
[00:47:00]  Uh-huh.  And remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth.  Thank you, America.  God bless you.  His black sense is coming through.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall from you.  Look at that map, though, man. 
[00:47:30]  Did you hear his black sense coming through?  Oh, a little bit.  America!  I would say being created.  He doesn't have a black sense.  He's a fucking Harvard Law Journal nerd.  Oh, is he?  Is he a Harvard Law Journal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I haven't seen anything from Harvard or any of the other fucking universities.  How about you fucking release that shit now?  Yeah, that should.  And let's see what you're all about, really.  That should all be released.  Of course.  All that stuff.  I'm offering ten bucks, by the way.  Ten bucks for him to fucking release it.  He definitely sounds different than he has in the past four years. 
[00:48:00]  He's talking about things that the day of the election, the second he won the election, he's  now talking about these controversial things.  He's kind of sliding them in there, these controversial things that he would never would have addressed  during the election.  All right.  Well, you got the Ed Schultz.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  I like Ed Schultz.  Fuck Ed Schultz in his fucking ass.  I'm not a fan of Ed Schultz.  You don't like Ed Schultz? 
[00:48:30]  He's trying to be the Rush Limbaugh for the other side.  Oh, good.  Oh, good luck.  Oh, good for you.  He dreams of being the Rush Limbaugh for the other side.  He works for MSNBC, and this is what he had to say.  In the face of obstruction, this president is going to go down in history as one of the  great ones because of all the obstruction and all of the social things that he had to  face and all of the comments coming from the Tea Party.  President Obama wins re-election, I think, on his record tonight, sticking up for American  workers, if you look at the map, we were unions, put their resources, is exactly where 
[00:49:00]  the president won tonight.  He won the Rust Belt, and he won where he had to win.  A flawless campaign.  Ed Schultz, go fuck your mother's asshole.  Fuck Ed Schultz.  Well, it was flawless.  He did run a good campaign.  It was an amazing campaign.  It was flawless.  It was, again, you know, both sides, but it was a filthy campaign.  Are we going to bring this nation together now?  Nope. 
[00:49:30]  Of course not.  It's completely divided and polarized, and it will only get worse.  Look at the map.  It's obvious that we could easily split this country.  Why don't we just do it, please?  It's so obvious.  Why don't we just have a fucking civil war and really get to fucking...  There's a lot of red south of us.  A lot of red.  Oh, God.  Disgusted.  Ed Schultz, my ass.  You need another party.  I'm telling you, it's because these guys, they know they can divvy it up.  Okay, I'll be the social liberal, the kind of socialist. 
[00:50:00]  You be the conservative.  It's like, you have to pick and choose, do I hate him less than him?  There's nobody you like.  Did anybody really like Romney, or you just hate him less than Obama?  None of them represent what fucking most people want.  None of them do.  Yep.  Hey, I out.  What else?  Tammy Baldwin.  Congratulations to her.  She becomes the first openly gay senator to win.  There you go.  She did it in Wisconsin.  Oh, really?  And the biggest... 
[00:50:30]  Let's take a look at her.  Get a picture of Tammy Baldwin up.  She's pretty.  I know what she looks like.  She's really hot.  Is she?  No, she's not.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  She looks like someone I know.  Yeah, she's fucking Jason Voorhees' mother.  Lick it, Mommy.  Lick it.  All right.  Tammy Baldwin makes history.  Not bad there.  Good for Tammy.  Good for Tammy.  Go ahead.  Human rights campaign she goes with.  That's fucking wonderful.  And then we got some states legalizing marijuana. 
[00:51:00]  Legalizing it or decriminalizing it?  Colorado.  Did they legalize it?  In Washington become the first two states in the country to legalize marijuana, but it's  still bad at the federal level, so the matter will have to be resolved in court.  How can the federal level, that's what I don't understand, how can they override the states  when it comes to that?  Why do they have jurisdiction there?  I have no idea how or why that works like that.  I don't know how states' rights can be trounced on at a federal level when it comes to marijuana. 
[00:51:30]  I mean...  If they say we want them to be able to smoke it here, the voters say that.  Why the fuck should the federal government have any say in it at all?  Yeah.  Especially in America.  In America!  The people have spoken.  They want their marijuana.  Reverend Al is absolutely going with a Frederick Douglass-haired...  Look at the back of Chris Matthews' hair.  The feet of all that we care about.  I mean, pretty frightening.  You're not always laughing.  He's happy.  Anything. 
[00:52:00]  I just love Chris Matthews.  Fucking...  Chris Matthews!  Because he's just a cartoon character.  Did you see that his hair in the back is sticking up?  Like Dennis Domenic.  What's going on with him?  That guy's a disaster area.  The Brian Regan of MSNBC.  Massachusetts becomes the 18th state to approve the use of marijuana for medical purposes.  Wow.  That's good.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't mind that.  I don't mind the pot thing either.  Wow.  Fucking smoke as much weed as you want.  As long as booze is legal, any fucking drug should be legal.  You might need some pot today. 
[00:52:30]  Booze is terrible.  You might need some pot today.  No.  Just to chill you out a little bit.  It would get me too paranoid.  I'd be sitting there going, oh my god, the president's...  The biggest loser...  Did we say this on air or off air?  The biggest loser in the whole thing.  I'll say it again if we did.  The biggest loser by far is Vince McMahon.  Oh, yeah.  His wife wasted $100 million in two campaigns.  $100 million of Vince's money.  Now, some would say, well, Linda, blah, blah, blah.  No.  WWE is Vince's company. 
[00:53:00]  He just allowed...  It's WWE money.  He just allowed his wife to kind of get involved and he gave her a good position in the company.  Would you be mad if your wife's hobby cost $90 million?  Oh, my God, yes.  Some say $100 million, but it's $90 million to $100 million.  Stay tuned this year.  We're going to have daily pay-per-views.  Every day of the week, a brand new pay-per-view.  I've got to make my money back, God damn it.  I've got to make it up.  Listen, all you wrestlers, you're going to be working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
[00:53:30]  And that means you too, Stone Cold E.T.  Must be nice to have a wife that has a hobby that costs you $90 to $100 million in what?  The last four years, right?  It's like, why not go into fucking, you know, flowers?  Get a flower bed, Linda.  Holy shit.  What hobby do you have?  Gardening or fucking a quilting bee?  Did she get her ass kicked?  Destroyed.  In Connecticut?  Yep.  Annihilated.  Wasn't even close again?  Not even close.  So what, Vince just has that type of money to just fucking burn, huh? 
[00:54:00]  Well, it was close, like, weeks ago, like, the polls and everything.  They were like, oh, Linda might win this thing.  And then I'm watching whatever channel I was watching last night, and immediately after  the polls were closing, the first forecasts or whatever were like 89% to the other guy.  Wow.  It never went, it never changed.  So I guess wrestlers just don't vote, huh?  No.  You would think they would do the right thing and get together in Connecticut and help out  Vince.  For all the pay-per-views and all the great fucking times. 
[00:54:30]  I like if they all ran into the polling places and just started dropping elbows on the fucking  people that were voting against there.  How many giant businesses are born in Connecticut?  You'd think that Connecticut had some kind of WWE loyalty.  Right?  Nothing.  The McMahons are not the Connecticut royalty we thought they were.  The Connecticut McMahons are outcasts.  Yes.  What do you think that household is like today?  Her consoling him.  She's apologizing through the bedroom door.  The only reason he gave her the money is she said the first thing she should do is pass  legislation that says $90 million goes to all men whose names start with V. 
[00:55:00]  So he's like, all right, I'll loan you the money.  You know that Vince, like this was all part of his thing.  Like he was envisioning a time when Linda, because he can't do it because there's too much  horrible tape of him.  But maybe Linda could get ahead.  Yes.  And in his mind, the McMahons were going to take the White House one day.  Yeah.  I don't know.  A different vision for you.  A different vision.  Senator McMahon.  President McMahon. 
[00:55:30]  I didn't want this wrestling for you.  Like he thought he was going to control the country through Linda.  Wow.  I'm drinking more wine than I used to.  Stop your spilling ass.  Read the funny papers.  Why don't we do this?  We got food in front of us.  We got lots to do today, man.  What was it?  Oh, yeah.  We got voters and why they voted.  Oh, no.  We got Karl Rove losing his fucking mind on Fox. 
[00:56:00]  Karl Rove, who was predicting a 300 plus electoral votes for Romney.  He's a hateable guy, Karl Rove.  He is an idiot.  What a douchebag.  MC Rove.  What a douche.  Oh, that guy.  Remember that?  Of course.  And then Diane Sawyer, a lot of people saying, very drunk last night as she was trying to  broadcast the whole election thing.  So, quick break and we'll continue.  Fucking take your cock and shove it up your pal's asshole.  I don't care.  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past week or so, since Obama was 
[00:56:30]  elected, I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  And here we go, I'm not the two names.  Come on.  I've been listening on the radio to what's going down on the O&A show.  Obama's got Anthony's tickets in a twist. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Something about the blacks and the guns in a space.  Wow.  Kissing them back.  They're going to take Ann's guns away.  Robbing the rich before the black man's batting down.  Wow.  That's just crazy if you think for a second.  Yeah.  Now, why the fuck would I want Anthony's chicken?  Listen, get in a show.  Get the chicken to smell me.  Wow.  Sweet radio show.  Yeah, that would sell me.  Yeah.  But am I getting paid?  And I.  Obama president now.  That's right.  Rob's gonna take Ann's money and give it all up to me.  I'm not taking this crap.  Rob's gonna take Ann's money and give it all up to me. 
[00:57:30]  Rob's gonna take Ann's money and give it all up to me.  We're moving on.  Rob's gonna take Ann's money and give it all up to me.  That's what you do.  You're a high profile radio coach.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  It's a United Negro.  Pull me a bun.  A chicken, every bed, and under 21.  So turn in your guns for the common brains.  Get a Starbucks for the great soda machines. 
[00:58:00]  Gonna get me fired at the Berkshire Inn.  And Anthony's gonna have to take it on the chin.  I'm bumping in the crackers at Dusty Clear.  It's the black man's time for terror and fear.  Don't worry about the mortgage or paying your rent.  Obama's got your back because he's heaven sent.  And when he's done improving my life, I'm gonna have more money than Ann's ex-life.  Rob's gonna take Ann's money and give it all up to me.  This is what we're dealing with.  Rob's gonna take Ann's money and give it all up to me.  Yeah, where it hurts.  In this country, you've been allowed to voice that opinion and then have a dialogue about it with other people who disagree with that opinion. 
[00:58:30]  That's great.  It's a great thing.  But we've got to this point where you just, you can't do that anymore.  It's, um, it's, no.  Hey, Obama president, nah.  That's what the president's gonna do for you?  Now you can walk in front of white people's cars.  I'm sick of it.  Do you need a baby aspirin or something?  Shut the F up.  I was blind, but now I see. 
[00:59:00]  Obama president, nah.  Serious, serious, serious.  This is the Opinetry Show, show, show.  Ha!  Ha!  I like this.  From Rocky.  Remember that?  Which one was this?  Rocky 3?  I think it was Rocky 8. 
[00:59:30]  The Man 2?  I think it was Rocky 2?  Rocky 4?  Rocky 3?  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha!  Which one was this?  He's working out.  Living in.  This was.  It was one of the later ones, obviously.  Wasn't it the one where he was in the hotel, like, lobby?  And he's working out?  Wasn't that?  Yeah, this is with Dolph Lundgren.  Oh, was it four?  I think it was four.  I think it was the one where Rocky was down and out, and then, like, halfway through the  movie, all of a sudden, like, the music kicks in, and he starts training. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it was that one.  Oh, oh, this is where Drago kills fucking Apollo.  Creed.  Sorry for the spoiler, people.  Yeah.  I will break you.  They're bringing Drago up in that elevated ring, and he's looking around at the decadence  because he's so Soviet, and he's looking around at the decadence like, what the fuck is this?  I will break you.  I'm still lying.  And then Mission Impossible is still using this theme of the Russian fucking fake cornball 
[01:00:30]  Hollywood.  Oh, you finally saw it, huh?  I had seen it a while ago.  No, no, no.  I was pissed off by that, too.  I was like, what are you doing?  I was starting a theater.  But they hinted.  But did you notice how they hinted there might have been a Middle Eastern angle to it because  they were in Dubai?  I think that's why they didn't do it.  I'll bet you that that was funded partially by someone in Dubai.  That's why they didn't show anybody technically falling out of that tower either.  Right.  They didn't want that.  Living in America.  Fucking cornball.  We got Karl Rove, and we got a news guy, Bertation, and we got Diane Sawyer. 
[01:01:00]  We want to get all this in, and then we're going to get Jay Moore on the program today.  Please.  So what do you want to do first?  You want to do the Karl Rove?  Yeah.  Karl Rove was predicting a Romney landslide with over 300 electoral votes.  That did not come to be.  Karl Rove is a twat.  Karl Rove is an idiot.  He's just a hateable twat.  MC Rove!  Exactly.  Oh, and he's dancing around, rapping.  We've had one instance where something was prematurely called. 
[01:01:30]  You know it well.  They said this is not going to be another one of those scenarios.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  But again, I just wonder, when you're sitting there with 4.4 million votes cast, a difference  of 991 votes between the two candidates, the difference is 49.19 to 49.17.  If a little bit of caution might not be better until, if it's going to happen, let the votes  begin to show it, let the rest of Cuyahoga come in, let the rest of, let some more Hamilton  come in, and start to see some of that separation.  So you're validating it, not doing what it seems to be a very early dose. 
[01:02:00]  Talk to Arnon Mishkin, Chris Dyerwald, Michael Barone's back there.  They're all very smart guys.  They're very smart guys.  I'm just saying that in terms of public perception, it looks a little odd for us to be making a call  with 991 votes.  That's how the science works.  They know the counties, and they know the expected outcome, the makeup of the remaining electorate.  And look, they've got a bigger data set than I do.  But I'm sitting here saying, I know Cuyahoga, of those 258,000 votes, it's going to be 70-30 
[01:02:30]  in all likelihood.  But in the Hamilton ones, depending on what's left out, it could be 60-40 the other way.  They didn't seem to think it was going to be that much in Hamilton County.  They're pretty confident back there, Carl, but we'll keep on going back and forth.  No, but Carl, what is that about?  Do you think he really believes that?  Because there is a science to this whole thing, and it gets very obvious how the counties are  going to come in.  They know very quickly, based on a sample of what's coming in on these counties, what  the rest of the county is going to do. 
[01:03:00]  So does he believe that?  He does.  He does?  Yeah.  He's delusional.  That clip was from 1140, which was over 30 minutes after Fox declared Obama.  Even Fox said.  Yeah, and you know they're going to hold out as long as they can.  And he's still going, no.  Oh, well, the next clip.  Yeah, so then they go to the Fox decision room.  Right.  And talk to them.  Now, here are the guys.  This is the decision desk.  Now we're in the heart of the decision desk room.  Ooh!  Arnon, you head this place up. 
[01:03:30]  Chris Jirewalt, you've been doing all the number crunching.  These guys behind.  You tell me whether you stand by your call in Ohio, given the doubts Karl Rove just raised.  We're actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio.  Basically, right now, there's too much Obama vote that's outstanding there.  And this is Fox.  We know it's going to come in.  Yeah, this is Fox.  They're explaining.  There's going to be Obama.  And while, yes, there are a number of counties out there that will be Romney, the largest  thing that's outstanding right now is the Cleveland area.  It's Cuyahoga.  This is Democratic territory, and we're quite comfortable with the idea that Obama will carry 
[01:04:00]  Ohio.  Wow.  What do you make of it, Chris?  There just aren't enough Republican votes left for Mitt Romney to get there.  And as Arnon points out, Cuyahoga County, Cleveland is so overwhelmingly Democratic, we  wouldn't expect Mitt Romney to do even much more than a third of the vote there.  So as the late vote comes in, we would expect to see the president's margin rise and rise.  Wow.  They just wouldn't let it go.  Oh, he wouldn't let it go.  He just wouldn't let it go, huh?  And then MSNBC actually brought it up. 
[01:04:30]  This is kind of amazing.  I will say that the politics of this, not just the counting of this, who's this guy?  Jessica Bieber?  I mean, what's happening on the right is that one of the on-air contributors at the Fox News  Channel is one of the single largest outside spenders in this race in favor of Mitt Romney,  who is Karl Rove, who is now trying to get on-air the Fox News Channel to rescind its call  in Ohio in favor of the candidate that he has bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions  of dollars.  This goes to the larger point that I've been making quite a bit, which is that there is 
[01:05:00]  going to be a big chunk.  I heard Steve talk about this.  A big chunk of one of the two sides that was not going to believe they lost.  There's more than just feeling aggrieved that they lost.  It's not a big chunk.  It's Karl Rove.  They don't believe it.  And I think you're going to have a large chunk of the Republican base that doesn't,  they're not going to understand it.  They've been told that the polls were skewed for weeks.  Oh, shut up.  The truth of the matter is, if the Republicans won in a race that was exactly like this, 
[01:05:30]  only reversed, the Democrats would be screaming that it was fixed.  There were problems.  There was voter irregularity.  They'd be screaming that because they're whining babies.  You know, I think the Republicans knew last night that it was over.  Not a large chunk of people saying, well, I think they're still going to pull it out.  No, they knew.  And you know what?  There weren't riots. 
[01:06:00]  There weren't fucking people crying about ballads and hanging chads in fucking broken machines.  What's a hanging ch...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that little piece of paper.  Chad.  Chad.  Yeah, I was going to say, what did Chad do wrong?  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  Hanging to a thump.  Hanging to a thump.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Well, can we go to the Bertation now?  Yeah, that's...  Go to Deadspin.  Deadspin has it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought Meatspin.  So what do you got? 
[01:06:30]  Local news in Michigan, I believe?  I think this is...  We've got to get this one on our Facebook page.  We love the Bertations.  Yeah, Michigan.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  Michigan.  Local news.  They're talking about the election.  And this guy just fucking...  Just stops talking.  He doesn't even know where he is.  He just looks into the camera, and it is just a total fucking brain fart.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  We'll have this clip.  Call anything.  Right now, it looks like all six proposals are headed for defeat. 
[01:07:00]  Proposal one, the referendum on the emergency...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Jeff, first of all, we talk about these proposals, how it's been trending toward...  They just look at him.  They're looking at him like, what did you just do?  They're so annoying.  He's looking right at the camera.  He's talking, and then he just stops and goes...  Can I hear that again?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, let's play that.  I wonder what went through his mind right there.  Now, it looks like all six proposals are headed for defeat. 
[01:07:30]  Proposal one, the referendum on the emergency...  Oh, I'm sorry.  First of all, we're talking about these proposals, how...  There's a guy who starts laughing at him.  But neither of them just goes, hey, you all right?  No kidding.  What the fuck is wrong with these these people?  Yeah, why can't you have a real moment?  Hey, you okay?  Probably had somebody talking in his earpiece and just couldn't handle listening and talking.  Do you think that was it?  You know what?  Maybe it was.  It kind of looked like he was distracted. 
[01:08:00]  That's right.  Yeah, because he leaned down, and then he said, oh, I'm sorry.  Like, he was talking to the man in his earpiece.  Yeah.  But he wasn't acknowledging that nobody...  He wasn't being a professional and acknowledging that nobody could hear the man in his ear.  You think it was one of the producers messing with him like we used to do to Steve?  No.  You want one phone call, Ant?  Yeah, all right.  Just one guy.  One guy.  He's been listening to you for the last hour.  Eric, what's up?  We are all up in some place.  Eric. 
[01:08:30]  He's worse than our...  Jesus, Eric.  I just have fun.  This idiot just waited 40 minutes.  He waited, waited, waited, and nothing.  Eric.  We hear you.  What could this guy possibly be doing?  Well, there he is.  Goodbye, Eric.  There you go, Eric.  40 minutes for nothing.  Yep.  All right, and then we go to Diane Sawyer.  A lot of people saying she was very, well...  A lot of people saying she was drunk, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She appeared to be intoxicated. 
[01:09:00]  Really?  There's kind of a montage of her coverage for what, ABC, I guess she works for?  Yes.  Is she thought to be a drinker?  I've never heard that.  I have no idea.  I'll be the judge of this.  All right.  Yes, the expert.  Watch...  Yeah.  The broadcast was very compound-esque.  Oh, okay, great.  Yes, drunk people sitting with graphics around them.  All right, hit it.  I want to give you a sense, though, of our election headquarters here.  I want to show everybody what we have right now.  Almost half of the voting for senior advisor, David Axelrod, worked in the White House.  And we know that the governor also has lucky milkshake. 
[01:09:30]  We are...  We are...  We've been spending a lot of time with these two candidates.  And we're really up close and personal, David.  And, of course, it's been long work days for people out west as they head in,  some of them tugging their children along.  But we have a projection to make without our music.  We need our music.  Many of you are tweeting us.  And I love precision tweeting, precision social...  She doesn't seem normal. 
[01:10:00]  She's drunk.  She seems a little tipsy.  Or maybe on a pill.  I don't know.  I don't know what she's into, but that's not...  There's something going on there.  There's a slur.  There's a slowness.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To her speech.  And the slouching that's happening, too.  Yeah, she's leaning over.  On one hand.  To Stephanopoulos.  She's like, yeah, yeah.  Doing that thing you do at a bar.  Why don't you show me that big Greek cock, honey?  Take out that big Greek hunk of meat and stick it in my Tanner Boyle hairdo face. 
[01:10:30]  In my shitter.  Like you Greeks do.  Yeah, come on, you Greek.  Why don't you fuck me where the Greeks...  Over to our headquarters and Katie Couric.  That's right.  And she has run so hard, so long, with so much money that we remind everyone how many people  around the world die, literally die, for the right to do what we have all done today. 
[01:11:00]  Drink at work.  Wow.  As we said earlier, countries from Mexico to Britain, from India to Brazil...  India.  India.  China is watching...  India.  I need you so.  ...designated to watch everything happening in this country tonight.  Oh, look at George.  And we got a wonderful tweet on why tonight matters, because somebody says, my grandparents  made sure I would always be free, because the whole world...  That's embarrassing.  It's like, I still remember the woman who went out and... 
[01:11:30]  The woman.  The woman.  Poor George Stephanopoulos feels like Opie did in 2000.  Doing a show.  The drunk woman.  I do think it's always interesting to imagine...  You never slurred like this, man.  I'm a good drunk.  And feeling the mood of the room.  Very functional.  See if we can hear it.  I have a question I wanted to ask, by the way.  At one point...  Oh, no.  They're laughing.  They're laughing.  Obama's campaign put an exclamation point after forward. 
[01:12:00]  It was just forward, and then it had an exclamation point.  When did they decide that was the right message for them?  Message?  And at the end of the day, as we're talking tonight, as these states...  As we're talking?  We may again be talking about the President Obama get out the vote machine.  Are projecting the battleground state of Ohio for President Barack Obama,  which means you are looking at the President of the United States... 
[01:12:30]  President...  President...  Who does she sound like?  It's audio replayed on our show.  She does sound like somebody.  Before.  Yeah, I can't figure it out.  That's the President...  The President of the United States...  I'm getting some intel.  I don't know.  This guy, Krusty Whistle, says,  I was embedded in the military with Diane Sawyer.  Oh, yeah?  And she is indeed a...  She likes...  According to this guy.  Likes to imbibe... 
[01:13:00]  According to this guy, a drinker.  I guess all newscasters drink.  Yeah, but what the fuck?  News...  People in the news industry, I've never seen a bigger group of drunks than the people that  work in the news.  It's amazing the amount of booze they can drink.  It's astounding.  Their job is literally to just sit there and, like, you know, after you do it for a couple  years, you got it.  Yeah.  You're done.  Yeah.  You don't have to think at all anymore. 
[01:13:30]  So you could be drunk.  And the hours are really weird because you got to work for, like, a little while and then  you're off for a big stretch.  But then you got to come back and there's really nothing to do.  So they just fucking drink.  Well, when we used to have more restaurants on the Upper West Side with the outdoor seating,  you would go...  You're right.  In between newscasts, you would see them outside having dinner, smoking cigars, having cocktails  in between...  Cocktails.  In between the 6th and the 11th.  You mean they weren't following leads and routing and... 
[01:14:00]  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters.  Was there a Fox argument recently?  Actually, someone said there was a Fox argument recently and I did it in between two anchors  and thought it was off the air.  Hot girls?  I wish.  Fox argument?  Yeah.  They're foxy.  Oh, it's funny.  I heard there was an argument recently between two anchors.  Oh, we would have had the audio.  That would have been viral, no?  I don't know.  There's an argument sound like between two anchors. 
[01:14:30]  Clang.  Clang.  Oh.  Clang.  Anchors.  I understood it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I understood it.  I knew what you meant.  Thank you to Jay from Huntington.  What up?  Frankie Blue.  Oh, yeah.  The famous Frankie Blue audio.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Jay from Huntington.  Yes.  It was hitting me when Diane Sawyer was talking.  It's that Frankie Blue shit.  $10,000 grand prize.  We have to play Frankie Blue now.  Frankie Blue.  We just have to do it.  $8,800. 
[01:15:00]  This guy was a massive programmer, and it just ruined his career.  I don't even know where he is.  Wow.  Yeah.  Where did Frankie Blue go?  We could actually play Frankie Blue in a break, and then we could get Jay Moore in here.  Oh, but really fast.  The bus driver from Cleveland.  Yeah.  Whose last name is Hughes, by the way.  Whoops.  One of my relatives, I guess.  Yeah.  Fired.  We said he would get fired, right?  Yeah.  So fired.  We said you just can't fucking uppercut a bitch and expect to fucking keep your job. 
[01:15:30]  And there's another angle, too.  It shows her assaulting him first.  Right.  Regardless of the fact that she was a real...  They said...  The bus company said that he didn't...  What he should have done was pulled over and called the transit police or whatever.  Yeah, huh?  Or hold her down or something.  The uppercut was a little too much for the bosses.  Yeah, you can't.  You just can't uppercut a woman in the face.  Oh, man.  She so deserves it.  Pretty much...  She absolutely deserves it.  Every person I've talked to has said that she deserves it. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So that guy got fired.  I think we called that a while ago.  That was a tough one to skate.  And then we got the nor'easter we talked about, yeah.  Hitting today?  Yeah, so they say.  It's going to be a nightmare for Long Island.  Will it affect Friday?  I'm flying to Toronto.  I don't think so.  We're all flying Friday.  Yeah, we got to get out of here, too.  Hey, you guys are going to L.A. I'm going to Toronto.  I'm doing...  I'm sold out.  Oh.  In Toronto?  Yes.  Congratulations.  No, no, no.  I'm not trying to plug.  It was a festival.  That's awesome.  But we have a nice following in Canada.  We're going to L.A. to do a little something.  Canada.  So we'll see how that works out. 
[01:16:30]  What's this L.A. trip?  It's going to be good.  I don't know.  I don't even know if they're allowed to say.  I don't know what it is.  I know what it is.  I know what it is.  There's some mystery and intrigue behind this trip.  It's some kind of fucking thing.  I'm doing some TV, but I don't really know what...  I don't know.  I don't know what's going to happen.  We have no idea.  I have no idea.  I'm going to see my old pal Jay and see how his kids are doing.  I'll hang out in a hotel.  I'll get room service.  Maybe a television show in Hollywood?  Hollywood.  Maybe run into our agent and have a boring dinner with him.  Oh, that is not...  He still texts my old number. 
[01:17:00]  Bob, you're still texting my...  Why would I say that?  He's not listening to the show?  No, he doesn't listen to the show.  I think we talked about it on the afternoon show, but have you picked up his calls?  No, still not.  Since your daughter was...  No.  How old is your daughter?  She's over a month now.  And he's called most days.  Yeah.  You haven't picked up, then?  No, not yet.  No.  Okay.  Hey, can we play that clip from that black chick from Baton Rouge?  What happened?  That was being questioned about how she might vote.  Oh, sure. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Let's play this clip.  This is a black chick from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  And she's being interviewed.  Okay.  By a guilty white journalist, I gather.  It's way out.  Oh, turn that up.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Jesus Christ.  What did happen?  I got to get my brother.  You know, my brother called me.  I'm like, well, I'm coming to meet you.  I'm going to bring you here.  What's important to you?  It's very important.  It's very, very important that we vote.  It is crucial.  I can't stress that. 
[01:18:00]  It's very, very crucial that we get out and vote.  Now, what race are you most interested in?  Black.  Is it the presidential?  Is it the mayoral?  Why didn't she call her out on it?  It's the presidential.  President Chiu.  You know what, though?  She did ask her, but she did clarify, is it presidential or is it mayoral?  When you say, what race are you most interested in?  The fact that she said black, it's so telling for a large portion of the community that that's just the most important part is the fact that he's black. 
[01:18:30]  Danny just told me he was one of the, I guess, Burger King or something.  And a couple of black chicks are talking to each other behind the counter, of course.  And said, you know, did you vote last night?  She's like, yeah.  Who'd you vote for?  Obama, of course.  And Danny said, why?  And then she gave him that look like, mm, like, mm, like, what do you think?  Oh, because you're black.  Right, Danny? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  She gave me, the only way to describe it is she gave me the, mm, mm, please face.  Like, mm, yeah, why you think I voted for?  Yeah, I said, I just said, who could please?  Oh, right.  Exactly, right.  Because behind the counter, the aura was that, of course you voted for Obama, right?  And the fact that, like, that's how she addressed me as a customer.  Like, of course you voted.  And I'm like, no.  She's like, how come?  I'm like, what are you kidding me?  Like, why did you vote for Obama?  And she just gave me this look.  Like, why you think?  Like, why you think?  Because you're black.  She was probably looking at you like that because you had a Burger King hat on with little crowns. 
[01:19:30]  No, they don't give those out during breakfast.  So this worked out so well that Democrats should start grooming another black guy for the next election.  No, the Republicans should.  The dumb Republicans.  You think they're going to go that route?  Can we get a white guy back in for the love of fuck?  But who cares?  They don't have any good black candidates.  They have zero black candidates.  You just made her terrible.  I'm not responsible for saying I voted for Obama because he was black and you're demanding a white guy. 
[01:20:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  It's different than Hillary Clinton.  I'm not saying she's just being dishonest.  Yeah.  And the news reporter wasn't calling her out on it.  That's not masking it.  I'm not masking it.  I want a white president.  You're hooding it.  I think a white president would look after my best interest better than a black president does.  Sorry.  That's just the way it is.  That's why black people vote for the black guy.  Stop.  Oh, okay.  So the Burger King thing was bad because they didn't specifically say... 
[01:20:30]  Because if you just said, yeah, I'm voting for him because he's black.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  Just say so.  If they asked her, why did you vote for Obama?  She'd come up with 20 fucking reasons to not say because he's black and I'm black.  Because they're fucking phony.  Phony.  So what quality are you looking for in a president?  Anthony Cumia.  Well, I think a white guy would best suit my interests.  And when you're catering mostly to 10% of the population and a 10% that is... 
[01:21:00]  There's a higher incidence of poverty and crime and whatnot.  I don't think you really are addressing the demographic of the entire nation.  I think you're pigeonholed into caring for a group of people that needs more attention  than the general public of the country.  And I don't think he's going to do a good job representing the entire country.  Are we going to do more of that clip or are we good? 
[01:21:30]  We're good with that clip?  That's the clip.  That was the whole clip?  Yeah, that's her.  That's her.  Black.  All right, because we've got to move along.  We've got Jay Moore waiting and we want to get to some other things, obviously.  You want to play Frankie Blue into break?  All good.  Oh, you got him.  Frankie Blue.  Christmas party.  And then what happened?  He's having a Christmas party.  They were doing a giveaway.  He went in.  No, I know, but there was another jock and she couldn't perform anymore.  So Frankie Blue went on the air for her. 
[01:22:00]  Filled in for her.  Filled in for her.  And he was just as fucked up, I guess.  He was hoping she took a hell of a piss.  He was fucking zooted.  They got into a fight and he kicked her off.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, it was a whole thing.  The Christmas party was pretty wild, obviously.  So Frankie Blue said, I don't need you.  I'm going on the air and I'm doing your job now.  And Chip is right.  Frankie Blue seemed like he was zooted at the time.  Can I make a radio observation, which will not help?  Yes.  But Danny, you really look like Chef from Apocalypse Now. 
[01:22:30]  Saucy-yay.  All I'm thinking of as Danny's talking is, I want someone to throw his head in my lap.  Danny's head in Bob Kelly's lap.  He doesn't have to get thrown there.  He'll just gently place it there.  So we go to break with Frankie Blue all fucked up on the air.  There you go.  Wow, that's pretty fucked up.  That's pretty good, man.  All that marbled meat, man.  It was gray.  Fucking tiger, man.  I know.  It almost sounds like Anthony last night. 
[01:23:00]  It's a fucking tiger.  Oh, fucking tiger.  Close.  Yes.  This ruined Frankie Blue's radio career.  Yeah.  We go to break with this.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue.  Coming in in the morning. 
[01:23:30]  Putting a hand in the big old barrel and picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest.  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull, they're going to put their hand in  the barrel, they're going to pick out a winner, and then they're going to fight that winner. 
[01:24:00]  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027.  Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  Get it.  Sirius XM.  This is the O'Brien and Anthony show.  E-Rock wasn't here when Jay was in Monday, right? 
[01:24:30]  Because he's not playing his theme music.  Right.  I have theme music?  Yeah, you got the Van Halen, or we could have went with Run to the Hills.  What?  It needs an extra verse?  The one that needs an extra verse.  I will say this.  The Opie and Anthony listeners really just...  The Opie and Anthony Army?  The O&A Army, man.  The Pests absolutely blew up Twitter after that show. 
[01:25:00]  That was good, goddamn fun.  Once Vetter and was...  I think once Chip was touring with Pearl Jam.  Yes.  And Dolores was there because it was a very special night.  That was crazy.  They really enjoyed that.  And then I'm laying in bed for two nights going,  Do I chase it?  I don't know.  Do I have it?  You guys probably do it all the fucking time.  Do you chase it?  And I'm like, oh, you know what?  There should be like a telethon for Dolores' floor.  With all the celebrities getting together. 
[01:25:30]  It was a great appearance, sir.  You need to call.  Dolores needs a new goddamn floor.  You can't keep bringing men in and asking her to lay down on her back to fix it every day, can you?  That's too much manpower.  Get her new floor.  Chip, are you a goddamn silent partner?  Hey, how come you...  How do I tell?  How come you're not how do I ask?  Good one, Chip.  I ask myself that all the time. 
[01:26:00]  That's good.  The kid has a good point, Anthony.  That's good, Chip.  I ask myself that all the time.  With my pants down, crying.  He's hilarious.  Yeah, how come he was Carson in charge?  My mother didn't go for that scene.  Oh, man.  Your mother doesn't go for much.  And when she does, she's all in.  She broke the goddamn floorboards.  She broke the goddamn floorboards.  She didn't like what you said about that old strawberry.  Well, it's Cal Daniels.  That's Colin.  God, every time I come in, I start trading guys. 
[01:26:30]  That's all right.  Wait, did you...  Are you a voter there, Jay Moore?  I was going to do an absentee ballot, but I was late on my absentee ballot,  so I was not able to vote.  But in general, you voted for California, right?  For my president.  Yeah, he just kind of fucking stormed Normandy on that one.  What do you think?  It is...  What do you think of the Obama thing?  I mean, it is what it is.  I'm not, you know...  I'm a big Chris Christie fan.  My favorite presidents are Truman and Nixon,  so I swing the gamut back and forth. 
[01:27:00]  I like Gavin Newsom, lieutenant governor of California.  Yeah.  Wasn't he the mayor of San Francisco one time or no?  Yeah.  He's fucking way too left for me.  Lefty.  Yeah.  Fucking left...  Hollywood lefty.  You know why I like him?  Why?  Because he's a super Catholic and doesn't believe in gay marriage or abortion,  but every time he votes, he puts his personal shit aside and votes for the people there.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Okay.  So he's like completely anti-gay marriage, completely anti-abortion,  and then when he goes to vote, he just puts his shit aside and votes. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, there you go.  Oh, okay.  The Bush administration wouldn't join the Kyoto Treaty,  which is like this international thing,  and somehow he got the city of San Francisco as a nation into the Kyoto Treaty.  So the city of San Francisco is like the number one recycling mulch.  Of course they are.  They love their mulch.  They sure are.  You know what I mean?  They love their mulch.  Hi, guys.  Time for mulching.  Mulch.  I see we're missing a letter.  Mulch.  Would you like to mulch?  Your dick smells like mulch. 
[01:28:00]  It should if you're doing it right.  Hot garbage.  Sizzling and hot garbage.  Hot garbage.  You want to be there with Otto?  Wow.  That was off mic.  You said you want to do the podcast when someone else is there.  Yeah, maybe I can do Otto.  He's doing it.  Yeah, I'm down.  I was supposed to do it last night, but I had to babysit the kids.  I Joe DeRosa, and I fucking went a little bananas on him,  how mixed up his brain is.  It's a little mixed up, huh?  A man with a vagina wants to beat him up, so he calls a woman with a dick for advice. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  What happens?  He wants to beat him up.  Buck Angel wanted to beat him up, so he called Bailey J.  He goes, what do I do?  Buck Angel.  And I'm trying to explain to him, like, you could beat up Buck Angel.  He goes, have you fucking seen that guy?  He goes, I go, he has a fucking vagina, Joe.  It's a woman.  It's a chick.  He goes, it's not a dude.  It's not a woman.  It's a dude.  And he's showing me pictures.  I go, all right.  But if that guy says, come over here and eat my pussy, could you?  And he goes, yes.  I go, that's a woman.  Oh, no.  If you said, come over here and eat my pussy, what would happen? 
[01:29:00]  Your dick and balls would hit me in my eyes and stuff, right?  That's because you're a man.  Right.  You're a goddamn man.  You're mixed up.  Fight the man with the vagina.  Circle away from the power hand.  Take the fight to the ground.  That Buck Angel is a unique situation.  Buck Angel, yeah.  Looks like Chappie.  If you had to be with Buck Angel or Bailey Jay, we've said this before.  Everybody picks Bailey Jay or Bailey Jay.  Yes, over most women.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a rough call.  But Bailey Jay's got a cock. 
[01:29:30]  That's a rough call.  Says you.  And Buck Angel, that's Buck Angel before the fucking...  Buck Angel is hot.  Looks like Tiger Woods' wife.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buck Angel is a beautiful woman.  I guess what bothers me is that he didn't go the full thing and get the, like, turn  the vagina inside out and make, like, a little Robin's egg penis.  Is he going to be on the Chip telephone, Chip?  Who's that?  The Buck Angel.  No, I don't know what that is.  That confuses me.  Does it?  No, my mother said, stop pulling your pud to that picture, Chip, or you're going to 
[01:30:00]  go to hell.  Put your pecker away.  Yeah, DeRosa's whole thing was, I don't know if I touch Bailey Jay's penis, is it going  to be, like, touching a hot oven?  Like, hey, hey.  Yeah, that's...  Just throw a hot oven in your mouth.  Yes, Joe.  And I go, well, that's the only reason you would be with that person, is, like, if not  now, when?  You know what I mean?  Like, here we are, all alone in a hotel room with the...  All right.  I just stare at her boobs.  Why does Buck Angel want to beat up Joe?  I didn't know that.  Because Joe and Florentine were in here shitting on Buck Angel once. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Were they?  Yep.  I think you were in Buffalo with Kenny December 28th.  Yes, I will be.  In Buffalo, yes.  We got a guy that wants to get on Ant's ass about Obama.  All right, go ahead.  That's...  Oh, he's pissed.  That's a fresh take.  I know.  But this actually...  He's mad because you openly admit you want a white president.  All right.  And you stand by that.  I just think it would be more in my best interest, personally, than a black president.  Let's go to Dave in Baltimore.  Black guy.  Dave, what's up, buddy?  I understand what Anthony's saying?  Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, you fuck. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Already a favorite.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm perfectly tuned in because I knew you and I'm waiting for Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh.  I want to hear all that vitriol coming out of your voice.  Oh, yeah?  Why are you talking like that?  Because let me tell you something.  You went to college.  I know he'll be a fuck that ain't done nothing for no black person.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  But the fact that all the white people had all this racist shit to say and the fact that 
[01:31:30]  white people can't, don't know how to separate a true black African from an African-American.  He won.  So what?  He fucking won.  Game over.  You guys are in.  You're in the club.  Congrats.  You made it.  Congrats.  Congratulations.  You made it.  Hey, Dave, you got to keep in mind, he won Florida because of an older woman white vote  at the end.  They just steam piled in at the end.  There's no way.  You can't get whiter than Miami, than Dade County, Florida.  There's not a systematic racism going on in this country anymore. 
[01:32:00]  Stop yelling at us, Dave.  Jesus.  We're all like Mel.  Jesus.  She said a big joint.  We're all relaxed.  You're yelling like the Sandman just pulled someone off the stage at the Apollo.  I look in the corner.  The Sandman is stretching.  A light-skinned girl.  She starts booing me.  I look over there to say a man is stretching.  Got him pregnant.  All right.  Dave, what do you got to say?  Yeah, why are you yelling?  That's a good point by Jay Moore.  Do you go to College of Everest?  Is that why you're yelling?  Why are you making it difficult? 
[01:32:30]  I just love the fact that you're mad.  That all white people are mad.  All white people aren't mad.  There's five.  You're an idiot.  I'm not mad.  There's five white people in this room.  There's one guy that's upset about the results.  I would have rather had Romney in there.  I'm not freaking out and burning my city down, much like if Romney had one.  Oh, you have a contract.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, believe me.  But Jay makes a good point.  We got five white guys in studio. 
[01:33:00]  I would say one is mad.  Overwhelmed with indifference.  One is mad.  Indifference.  It wouldn't make a difference no matter who's president.  Don't you remember what...  And you know what?  If Obama wasn't such a tax-and-spend Democrat, I would be genuinely happy he won.  That's my only issue with Obama is that he's a tax-and-spend Democrat.  You are a damn liar.  That's not your only issue.  It really is.  Why are you talking about Cab Calloway?  Howdy, howdy, howdy, who liar?  No, why would I lie?  That was Jimmy Norton, by the way. 
[01:33:30]  That's Ms. Jim.  That's my only issue with Obama.  I've said that all along.  Why is Jimmy lying?  Why am I lying?  I hope Obama...  No, no, no.  Why is Jimmy lying?  First of all, why is Jimmy lying?  Why am I lying?  Let's stay on the talking points, Dave.  And then you can do the hope Obama thing.  Yeah, why am I lying by saying that?  Because I heard what you said about the fact that you won a white president.  I didn't say that!  That's Anthony, you idiot!  We don't all look alike.  You're missing us up.  Come on, Daniels.  I'm Jim.  Anthony said that.  What you said about a white president is really the secret desire of all white people. 
[01:34:00]  Jim is just idiotic.  Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, stop.  That's Dave!  That's idiotic.  Dave, you're being really stupid.  Dave, listen for a second.  You have two ears.  Listen.  Jim Norton said he would like Obama more if he was not a tax-and-spend Democrat.  You said you're a liar.  Why is that lying?  Because he thinks it's me.  No, no, no.  No.  Fair is fair.  Yeah.  Okay, go ahead.  Jim Norton said he's a tax-and-spend Democrat.  You called Jim Norton a liar. 
[01:34:30]  Why is that lying?  Go.  Okay.  Hello.  Maybe I was wrong on that, but I was wrong.  Yes.  What a jerk.  At least I can admit it.  At least, can you admit it within yourself that if Romney had won, that you wouldn't be running around with sparklers in your hands?  I'd be a lot happier.  Man, this guy's completely missing the point.  Anthony is openly around with sparklers in your hands.  Anthony is openly admitting everything you're saying. 
[01:35:00]  I'd be happier if Romney would have won.  But the truth of the matter is, you're saying...  Shoot looters off your lawn.  You're saying that's the secret...  With your drone in your yard.  The secret.  Every white person wanted a white president.  If that was the case, the white president would have won, you idiot.  You dummy.  It's fucking...  It was put to an election.  A lot of white people voted for Obama.  Let me tell you something, man.  Right?  First of all, I'm a Hebrew.  We're like...  Ain't nothing...  Rasa Fari.  One of those. 
[01:35:30]  Original Hebrew.  You know how we do, bro.  Wait.  Are you a fan of this show?  How great is that?  A Hebrew-Israelite that listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  That's nice.  You are the only one.  These useless people that stand on the corner fucking pontificating revisionist history and bullshit.  All right.  Listen.  It is revisionist history.  You weren't princes and kings.  You didn't have giant fucking buildings and fucking great infrastructure and machines and airplanes and shit.  You had nothing. 
[01:36:00]  And still, Africa's a petri dish.  Africa's a petri dish of poverty and disease.  How come you don't call it revisionist history?  Jay is tapped out.  He doesn't have a contract.  I'm going to be at Governor's in Long Island.  See you later, Jay.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Remember Pearl Harbor.  How come that's not revisionist history?  You a fuck.  What about Pearl Harbor?  You a fuck.  I a fuck.  You a fuck.  What about Pearl Harbor?  What about Pearl Harbor?  This is about Pearl Harbor.  You don't want to call it revisionist history.  You don't mind bringing up the past when you're talking about what happened to a mafia in the past and how a maka got so soft. 
[01:36:30]  Who's a maka?  You want to talk, when a black man want to talk about what the disadvantage that white people have been to them.  Oh, now we bring it up.  Shut up.  You know what?  That's not a bad point.  Why?  How come people get mad when you say, how come people get mad when you say black people complain  about the past, but people are like, ah, shut up, let it go.  But no one gets mad when someone says, hey, you know, talk about American history, how we've been wrong.  That's not a bad point.  You're not, but we're not fucking going over to Japan and smacking people in the face over Pearl Harbor. 
[01:37:00]  That shit's ancient history.  Because you nuked and bombed the shit out of them.  Yeah, okay.  So, get all your Africans together, build a nuke, and fucking pay us back for slavery.  What do you want from me?  That's coming.  That's coming.  All right, you think it is?  You want a revolution, fucker?  10% of the population.  Bring it.  Bring it.  And check us out.  You've got to be dying.  If you want to nuke the United States from Africa, you've got to call now. 
[01:37:30]  What a dumb bunch of people thinking 10% of the population can overthrow the fucking country.  It's only one guy.  Stop it.  Nuclear war end.  Right out of Uganda.  First of all, you hold your gun sideways so you can't aim.  Secondly, you never clean the fucking things so they jam constantly.  Thirdly, you'd be taking out all your own people with your fucking scatterfire.  You people can't shoot.  Go to the range.  At least learn to shoot each other right. 
[01:38:00]  Don't hit grandma or the kid at the playground, you fuckers.  Go to the shooting range.  Practice.  Hold the gun straight.  How about this way?  Hold the gun straight and turn the phone sideways when you take video.  Jesus Christ.  Dave, that was a good one.  Yeah, he's not listening.  Dave, you've got to listen a little, too.  Dave's on hold.  We can go back to him.  Dave, can I ask Dave?  Steve is pissed off, though.  He's a black guy from Houston.  Yes.  And he's saying that guy does not represent black people. 
[01:38:30]  Sorry, that's horrible.  Steve in Houston.  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Well, you got Jeremy Lin, you motherfuckers.  Fuck Jeremy Lin.  I'm so tired of this.  I like the Jeremy Lin.  He's having a good season so far.  You guys act like we let Bob Pussy loose.  Fucking Jeremy Lin.  The guy had 30 games.  He had a triple-double pretty much the other night.  He had 31 points.  You've got to be dialing.  If you want to take over this country, black people, get on that phone and give me a call.  It's a Linsanity jersey.  Linsanity.  Complete with a soy sauce stain. 
[01:39:00]  Everybody says, the problem with the Knicks.  The problem with the Knicks is they all get these awful extensions.  And then the one time they don't extend the contract, everybody goes, oh, how do you not extend that guy?  Pick a lane, Knicks fan.  Wait, so this guy.  Well, we wanted Jeremy Lin to stay.  This guy brought a lot of excitement to me.  This guy disagrees with the black Israelites?  Steve in Houston.  I wonder how they would interact together.  Oh, that's true.  Well, the other guy, I did say.  Did Dave hang up?  Yeah, he did.  Oh, you did.  You should have stayed at home.  I did not hang up on him.  I wanted to go back to him. 
[01:39:30]  I wanted you to argue.  Go ahead, Steve in Houston.  Okay, it was just so much going on with Jay Morris.  There's going to be a governor.  But anyway.  Atta boy.  What was that, sir?  I think what the guy was trying to say, I think what he was trying to say is that, Anthony,  you made such a point of how black people are voting for Obama just because he's black.  But you need to point out the fact that a lot of white people are not voting for him because he's black. 
[01:40:00]  And that's the simple reason.  And enough voted for him to put him in office.  And you would still find something wrong with the guy.  No, not true.  That's a pretty good one right there.  But the fact of the matter is his four-year record was not enough for me to go, wow, this guy needs another four years.  I would have rather had a businessman in there during this hard economy that maybe he could have done a better job.  But white people put Obama in office.  So there isn't this fucking systematic institutional racism going on in this country anymore. 
[01:40:30]  And black people got to realize that.  There's always going to be individual racism and shit like that.  But there's not this systematic racism keeping the black man down anymore.  So I'm not going to put up with it anymore.  I'm going to speak my mind.  I'm going to fucking say things.  I'll fucking, you know, it's a fair game now.  We're all on equal footing, people.  You made it.  Equal footing?  Not quite there yet.  Yes, you are, you fucking piece of shit. 
[01:41:00]  Yes, you are.  You're on equal footing.  There's nothing as a black man you cannot achieve that a white man can't achieve.  Stop with the excuses.  Stop it.  No, Anthony, by all means, I've never made an excuse.  I went to graduate school, undergrad.  I did the engineering route.  Yep.  I challenged.  I'm a good family.  Good for you.  I don't make excuses.  But I'm letting you know, as an American professional, they always, when I walk through  the room, judge me based on that first.  And I have to recede and perform. 
[01:41:30]  Everyone gets judged like that.  That's fine.  I can accept that.  Everyone gets judged like that and everyone's got to perform.  Let me tell you something.  When I got into the business of radio, I was put in there as a fucking sheet metal worker  that didn't know shit about radio.  Hold the fuck.  I love it.  How could you hear what you're saying if you're talking?  I had to perform and I had to make it work for me to keep that job.  I didn't keep it because I'm white or Italian or any other thing.  It was my talents and whatever I had that allowed me to continue doing this job. 
[01:42:00]  Black people, same fucking thing.  You're going to be judged on what you do.  There is not institutional racism in America anymore.  Stop with the fucking excuses.  Holy shit.  All right.  Listen.  I'm sorry.  But once again, Anthony, we're on the same accord.  I agree with you.  I believe that a lot of black people, they focus on the wrong thing.  They make their excuses.  Yes.  I'm very conservative in my views.  Very conservative.  But I just feel like the point that the gentleman was trying to make is that you made such a huge 
[01:42:30]  stand on so many black people vote for Obama because he's black.  But we equally have that the race of the white was like, I'm not voting for that nigga.  I.  It's just one point.  That's okay.  I say it all the time.  There was a lot of that happening.  No, but what he's saying is completely true.  It's true.  There's a lot of, half of white people will not vote for him simply because he's black.  Not true. 
[01:43:00]  That is true.  Not true.  You're right.  Don't.  Anthony, don't be crazy on me.  There are people, but not half the fucking white people in the country.  I made that number up.  How about the people that.  Oh, don't.  Easy.  How about the people that don't like what he did as president or the lack thereof?  How about 90, 99% of the black people voting for him?  You won't even meet me on what I just said, that half the white people won't vote for him  because he's black.  No, not half.  Maybe not half, but even if it's 20%.  A third.  Even if it's 20%, that's still 40 million or 30 million people. 
[01:43:30]  Maybe those people, but does it have to be racism or does it have to be the fact that  I think a white president best represents the majority of the country?  Is it racism when blacks only vote for Obama?  You said yes.  But based on his record of impoverishing black people and, and keeping it unemployment at  14 and a half percent and fucking, uh, uh, uh, put it, giving them, uh, I voted for  Pat Paulson, but you just said a white president would better benefit you.  Not, not necessarily Romney, but the president isn't better, better benefiting the black 
[01:44:00]  people.  No, no, but you're saying the same thing.  It's the same thing.  No, it's not.  But you don't think, I know, I know, I can only speak for myself.  I know his, his, his views and financial, uh, policies do not benefit me at all, nor  my wife.  I mean, I, you know, I get raped from interest.  I pay on student loans or medical school, everything.  Where'd you go to college?  Oh, Texas A&M undergrad, Tulane Grand School.  But Texas the whole time. 
[01:44:30]  Look at that.  One man putting in work.  I dig it.  And do you believe there are, uh, like this is a lot of white people that did not vote  for Obama because he's black for the simple fact that he's black.  Not, not, not simply based on racism.  No, no.  And that's, you're too smart to have that stance.  Nope.  You're too intelligent a guy to just not even meet us there.  Well, do you think people voted for Obama that were white because of white guilt?  Some, sure.  Yeah.  Some.  And there was a finite number compared to the amount of people that didn't vote for him  because he's black.  There's absolutely a lot of white people that didn't vote for him because he's black. 
[01:45:00]  Who gives a shit?  The motherfucker got him twice.  No, no, no.  We're not saying who gives a shit.  We're saying at least...  You got him twice.  Stop it.  There's gonna be?  How the fuck did I get on the stop it list with you?  There's gonna be racism.  What the fuck did I do?  There's gonna be individual racism in this country.  You changed, man.  No, I didn't.  I've always been this guy.  I'm just a big jerk.  There's always been, there's individual racism.  But you really don't think white people didn't vote for Obama?  Yes, of course there were.  Because he's black?  There were, yes, but I'm not saying...  I think it's a big number, too. 
[01:45:30]  Nope.  Not based on racism, black.  All right, what percentage do you think?  I don't think they think he would represent them.  No, no, but it's not racism in a hateful way.  There's weird racism.  It's like you said something really honest.  I think that a white president would better benefit me.  You're not saying in that moment, I hate blacks.  You're saying, I think my guy would do a better job for me.  So blacks are looking at it the same way, like, you know what?  I think that guy, my guy, would do a better job for me.  It's always based in racial hatred.  But he's proven that he hasn't in four years. 
[01:46:00]  So you're not voting on his record.  But they may not feel that they're going to do any better under, like, George Bush or Mitt Romney.  Black people may not feel like, hey, at least it's our guy we're not doing as well.  You know, it's like people probably aren't looking at it like, it's not like under Bush things were amazing,  and then they fell into the toilet, and then they're going, we're not voting for this guy because he's white.  It was like, if things had stayed the same, why wouldn't they just...  If there was a black Republican president and a white Democratic candidate, 
[01:46:30]  and the black Republican president put in policies that were going to help me tax-wise and whatnot,  I would vote for him.  Yes.  I would vote for him.  Yeah, I get it.  I'm not just going to vote, but black people are only voting.  You're a Republican?  Yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Sorry.  A little slow today.  But we all know white people that didn't vote for Obama because he's a black guy.  Absolutely. 
[01:47:00]  Why do Republicans have no black candidates at all?  Zero.  There's no interesting black candidates.  Fucking Herman Cain is the best they want for him.  We've got to get her away from that guy.  What happened?  Oh, sorry.  But there's no black...  The blacks were not voting for Romney because he was white.  There are plenty of blacks...  There are plenty of blacks that would have benefited, benefited from Romney being elected president,  but they didn't vote for him based purely on race.  Okay, let me ask you this.  Will it come out, the percentage of blacks that voted for Obama over Romney? 
[01:47:30]  Will we get that number?  Sure.  I'm sure that'll come down the road a little bit.  Yeah, sure.  It's probably 95% at least.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's a massive...  If a black guy or woman was going out to vote, they were going out to vote for Obama.  Oh, I'm saying...  I want a woman president.  Why didn't the Republicans take some of their Condoleezza Rice as a VP or somebody...  Why don't they fucking think differently and balance that out?  They're dummies.  The Republicans are fucking dummies.  They blew it.  They blew it with McCain by letting that dumb cunt from Alaska in. 
[01:48:00]  Jesus.  They have done nothing but blow it.  And they have nobody but themselves to blame.  No, they do have somebody else to blame.  The fucking media that was campaigning for Obama for two fucking years.  That's part of it.  One of the campaign.  They licked his ass.  They didn't call him out on things.  That's true.  Fucking Benghazi just slipped on by.  That's true.  But Romney fucked himself.  Romney fucked himself by having that dumb audio leak out.  It's like, do you understand how many people look at that and are going to fucking hear that and say, what are you doing?  Well, that would have been nice to have the audio leak out of Obama not calling the terrorist act a terrorist act. 
[01:48:30]  Or the fact that he said, I'm all for distribution of wealth.  And there's a lot of things Obama said that the media didn't push out.  I think your point is a higher percentage of blacks vote for Obama because he is black.  But all I want to throw into the argument, there were absolutely white people that didn't vote for Obama because he's a black guy.  I would never say that.  But I agree with you that the percentage was way higher with the black vote.  Yes.  I do agree with you on that.  What about the brown votes? 
[01:49:00]  Nobody's even talking about the Latinos.  Well, the Latinos put them over the top.  They did, right?  Yeah, in a lot of states.  A lot of Latinos.  Romney has more Latinos today than there were last night.  They gave them a lot of fucking votes.  They just keep going.  Romney has more Cubans, I think, than fucking Obama.  Cubans.  Who's talking about Cubans, you nutnik?  Let's go to Naomi.  Black woman, Texas.  Oh, my gosh.  Here they come.  Naomi.  Yes.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Testing one, too, right?  Yeah.  What up?  What up?  Well, I believe there is some racism, but it's a whole lot of black people that just 
[01:49:30]  didn't vote for him either.  Because they didn't want Obama to be their token nigger.  Really?  Yeah.  What kind of phone are you on?  No, I think that's our phone.  The second caller in a row that's had that.  Yeah.  It was like this yesterday, but why take the phone?  So you're saying that a lot of blacks didn't want him to seem like a one-time token, like,  hey, we got him in.  Well, the thing is, we have our first black president, and this is who's going to represent  us as a hoe. 
[01:50:00]  A hoe?  It's a whole lot.  A hoe.  Like a whole general.  Yeah.  How about you use the L?  Holy shit.  Black people love leaving the L's out.  Yeah, dude.  Well.  That could be seen as a little racist.  Ho.  No, no, it is.  It's a black dialect, I guess.  Oh, my God.  A contract.  What?  We're just going to talk about Planet Earth.  It's fair game.  It's fair game.  We're all part of this country now.  And then Planet Earth is my place of birth.  So wait, what are you saying?  Yeah, what are you saying?  Yeah, what are you saying?  What are you saying, dear?  What I'm saying is, I didn't want to vote for Obama the first time, but they put that 
[01:50:30]  joke over McCain and had that idiot Terrence Palin going with him, and so he fucked  with that.  Did you think McCain was bad, though, or just Sarah Palin?  I thought McCain, I thought he was a good man.  Well, no.  Sarah Palin, I thought, hurt him.  Well, Sarah Palin was the problem there.  McCain always looked like he was walking across very cold water.  He always had his hands up and a weird look on his face.  We were in the, both my husband and I were in the military, and he has this prisoner of  war mentality. 
[01:51:00]  We didn't want to go back, so we weren't going for the man.  What's a prisoner of war mentality?  Be quiet and they give me rice?  No, I feel like he would have put us back overseas, as far as keeping people in war.  Yeah.  All right, Naomi.  You've got to beware of the military-industrial complex, right?  Thank you to Naomi.  We've got a Hispanic guy.  Texas is where Governor Connolly got shot with that other one.  They call it a magic bullet.  I bet Governor Connolly didn't think that bullet was very magical, you know? 
[01:51:30]  Hit the guy fucking three times.  What's magical about that?  He probably called it the unlucky bullet.  You think he's walking around the house going, has anybody seen my lucky bullet?  The one that made a goddamn U-turn underneath my ribcage, hit my sternum and said, which  way is north?  That's for Anthony.  Trying to lighten this up, you fucking, all of a sudden it's goddamn Hannity and Colmes  in here.  Emphasis on Hannity.  No kidding.  Roger says he's Hispanic and didn't vote for Romney because...  That's great.  Because he's white. 
[01:52:00]  Because he's white.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Can we hear him?  Yeah.  That shit absolutely is happening all over the place.  Brooke shows his mother died.  Hello.  Roger.  Put her in pretty, baby.  What could go wrong?  No, I didn't vote for Romney because he is white.  How many black presidents have we ever had?  You're a gay Puerto Rican, man.  I'm going to guess one.  Yeah, we can figure that out pretty easily.  But, yeah, I've had enough with the old white men.  Yeah, because it's really done the country so bad, having old white men run it for a 
[01:52:30]  fucking couple of hundred years and build it into what it is and watching one black president  pretty much dismantle it.  Nice.  Nice.  Well, nobody dismantled anything yet.  Well, we'll see.  Enough has been put in place where I'm getting kind of an inkling of what the next four years  is going to bring.  Wait, you can't say you've had enough, but he hasn't dismantled anything yet.  That means you liked the place the country was at.  There goes the chip benefit.  Him.  Well, the country has had nobody else represent what this country stands for, which means 
[01:53:00]  being the black president, he's the only one so far that's overcome what's going on.  And so now we're like, okay, you know what, he's had four years, he's had enough.  Let's put somebody else back in.  Why don't you just put him in a powdered wig?  Get back to the good old days, you know?  No, I'm not saying.  Nice little ponytail with a bonus.  He won.  How are black people calling up and Hispanic people calling up and giving me shit? 
[01:53:30]  He won.  Stop.  No more excuses.  I'm done with excuses.  I have not said that we've had enough of you, Anthony.  Come on.  Of course not.  You're fucking a third of the show already.  No one has enough of me.  I'm magical.  All right.  Thank you.  Anthony makes a good point.  I'm with the magic.  Anthony wants to have that change.  A lot of bullets.  All right, Roger.  Thank you, Roger.  All right.  Phones are like a little rough right now anyway.  Yeah, they sound awful.  I'm sure the app is still not working. 
[01:54:00]  I don't know.  Hey, I'm a black guy.  Anthony, I think you're wrong.  Hey, I'm a white guy.  I think Anthony's right.  There you go.  Way to, you know, really split it up, you guys.  This nation is very divided.  There's another black guy who thinks Anthony's wrong.  Very divided nation.  No, we got a black guy that thinks Anthony's right.  How about that?  All right.  How about that, Conquist?  David from Irvington.  Let's go to North Carolina.  This is a rabble-rousers.  What do you think a black guy, Jesse Helmstead, a black guy's going to step out of line and speak  his mind?  Please.  This is Isaiah.  He lives 100 miles from Lynchburg, Virginia. 
[01:54:30]  Isaiah.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, I just wanted to say, I think, Anthony, I think you're absolutely right, man.  Yeah, but how black are you?  You sound pretty white.  Yeah.  You're just Malcolm Jemal Warner with a pierced tongue and everything.  But I still, I feel like, you know, I have, you know, I've been around African-Americans  and I know my real parents.  And my actual parents didn't vote for Obama either.  So, um, uh, I think, I think that, uh, I think that, you know, Mitt Romney would have 
[01:55:00]  been a good candidate.  You're a nervous wreck.  What'd you say?  I said you were a nervous wreck.  Why don't you take a few deep breaths?  Yeah, what's your point?  I'm walking around.  Well, of course you are.  Why don't you stop?  Because if you stand still in North Carolina, they'll get to you.  He's no dummy.  Keeps it on the move.  Every time he sits still, he goes, you know, my parents all voted for Romney.  You guys are a riot.  Okay.  Isaiah, what's your point?  What's my point? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  It's coming out the top of your head.  I think all people are equal.  Go to that well all day.  But I, but I think that, um, that, that people who, I think that when you vote, you should  vote on principle and not just because the money's black.  I completely agree.  But unfortunately that's not what happens in elections.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But I'm just, I'm just saying that because the last guy who followed in before the other  two was like completely irate.  And I think that's just completely unnecessary too.  Yeah.  But he was being honest.  I mean, race has always been a big part of this country. 
[01:56:00]  It still is.  It always has been.  No matter how we look at it or policies, the feelings of race, it's always been something  really prevalent in our thinking, but it's something we never really talk about or we  talk about in a, in a back way.  Or we, we know people are not, you know, at least, and I'll say there's times I don't  agree with you, but you're a fucking honest guy.  You speak your mind.  And some of these guys call in and speak their mind.  Most people don't do that.  I like an open dialogue like that.  It's fine.  Most people are phony.  I don't care if people disagree and shit like that. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, but if you won't admit that white people didn't vote for Obama just because  he's black.  Some.  What's some to you?  I don't have percentages.  What do you think?  I don't fucking percentages on that amount of people?  How much do you think?  What percentage?  I'm asking you.  20?  20%?  I would say.  What would your percentage be?  A guess based on nothing.  Okay.  20% which not based on the fact that fuck him because he's black, but I don't believe  he's going to represent me best being a black guy. 
[01:57:00]  I don't think he's got my best interest and I don't think he actually has the best interest  of the nation as a whole in his presidency.  I really don't.  But saying he doesn't have my best interest at heart, meaning as a white guy, isn't that  the same as saying I'm not going to vote for him because he's black?  No.  And if no, couldn't black people be saying the same thing about Obama?  It's not fuck white people, but I don't feel that a white guy has my best interest  in it.  I feel that a black guy does.  I could understand that when they were electing him for the first term because, you know,  the first black president, you're all going to whoop-dee-doo and get behind it. 
[01:57:30]  I understand that.  It's a benchmark moment, a history-making moment, but based on the past four years and  what the position black people are in now economically, why would you vote this guy in again?  He's done nothing but decimate you economically.  I'm talking about the black community, but they vote for him just because he's black, not  because if Obama was talking about everything I wanted and proved it in four years that I'm 
[01:58:00]  like, wow, he cut taxes, the deficit's down, the military's strong, he's there.  I would vote for him.  I wouldn't just vote along party lines.  And I'm not kidding you.  I'm not just saying that.  I would have voted for him.  But there's no way.  That's a fucking, you might as well have a unicorn.  Then Romney should have been more of a moderate, which is what he is.  And I, as a guy who does not dislike Mitt Romney, I felt like I know nothing about this  fucking guy.  I felt like he was a wishy-washy twat and it annoyed me.  It was like, just be the moderate guy you are. 
[01:58:30]  Romney Carey got passed and don't just, don't just fucking try to appease the extreme right  side of the party.  You don't need to do that.  What do you think?  They're going to vote for Obama over you?  You dope.  Yeah.  He annoyed me with that.  Let's say hi to Patricia in Pittsburgh.  Patricia.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I'm white, but I work, I've always worked with a lot of black people.  I'm like, what are you, corrections officer?  Three guys broke their ribcages, squeaked through the same door just now. 
[01:59:00]  Jimmy squeaked it up.  I work in the mental health field.  I got to tell you, over the past couple weeks, all I've heard is, give a brother a chance.  Come on, give a brother a chance.  Most certainly, there are tons of black people who just voted for Obama because he's black.  I don't know if that's racism or not.  I mean, I voted for Hillary back when it was between Barack and Hillary.  I voted for Hillary because he was a woman.  Yeah, people do that all the time.  People will do that.  Whether it's a woman, a white guy, a black guy.  I don't understand why people think we're the same religion as them.  We're so above the animal kingdom on this planet. 
[01:59:30]  We're just part of it.  If I was Barack Obama during the debate, ask me about the debt ceiling, Anthony.  How about the debt ceiling?  This guy wears magic underpants.  That's what I think about the debt ceiling.  The guy next to me has magic underpants on.  The guy thinks that Native Americans are Jewish.  All right.  Thank you.  Patricia.  She's Louise.  We got the Chris Matthews clip.  If Sam wasn't here, it would be a completely quiet room.  All right.  This is the Chris Matthews clip of him saying something about the hurricane. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  Sandy.  He believes the hurricane had something to do with this election.  All right.  Let's hear his exact words.  I want to hear his exact words instead of people tweeting.  But the superstorm hit a lot of states that were already Obama.  Yeah, but Obama was on national television.  With Christie.  Oh, it was out there.  Yeah.  Knock down Rami's voice for a while.  You're right.  That turncoat fatty Christie.  Hey.  Watch this.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him how?  Crying as he's fucking hugging Bruce.  How did Bruce get his hands around that big fat fuck? 
[02:00:30]  But I like Chris.  I like him more now.  I like Chris for doing that.  I think we need more of that.  He plays long.  He plays tall.  He's like Tayshaun Prince.  So what did I look that long when he plays long?  What's his name say?  You don't respect Christie for doing that?  No, I know it.  He doesn't look good within his own party for doing that.  But he knew at the time, at the time, it was the right thing to do.  I'm just fucking right.  I know he had to do what's best for Jersey.  Put Governor Christie in Twitter, man.  They fucking hate him for doing that.  Yeah, I know.  They fucking hate him.  No, that's silly.  He knew for his state that was the right thing to do. 
[02:01:00]  I know he needed it.  And the fact is, he didn't need to do it because the president should have been there with all the fucking support.  You don't need a governor to go in there begging for federal funds for a fucking disaster.  But I understand his point.  He's a bit emotional.  They made that fucking Atlantic City mayor, by the way.  Sorry.  They made him sit out when him and Christie toured fucking Jersey.  That Atlantic City mayor sat in the airplane hangar for four hours, and Obama gave him two minutes.  Wow.  Obama gave him nothing.  He was furious at that guy.  So Obama kind of crossed the party line, too.  He didn't give up that fucking thing. 
[02:01:30]  It might also be Katrina, the local government, was so screwy, and it took so long for the feds to get involved.  And I think Obama just stepped up the plane and said, who's in charge here?  Ain't you?  Yeah.  Ain't you?  Well, here's Chris Matthews talking about the superstorm.  All right, let's share this.  Well, let me just close my thoughts tonight.  Please.  It takes a half a second.  I am so proud of the country to reelect this president and overcoming, not because of the partisanship or any of the, even the policies.  Just the fact, here's an African guy. 
[02:02:00]  Shut up, you fuck.  God, he's got to bring it up.  He just does, yeah.  Enough.  What happened?  African guy.  Chris Matthews.  That startled me.  Guiltiest white guy in the world.  Guiltiest white guy in the world.  I would love for Chris Matthews to be walking down the street and get one of those closed-circuit fucking security cam views of four black guys punching him in the face and stomping on his head and stealing his wallet.  Look at Ohio.  Yeah.  The blue rose to the top in that state. 
[02:02:30]  Wow.  I have to tinkle desperately.  What?  What happened?  No, Jimmy.  I want to hear Chris Matthews.  Okay.  Even the policies.  Just the fact, here's an African guy, African-American guy from an unusual background.  No, Africa.  Part immigrant background, part African-American background.  With all this assault on him from day one, from Mitch McConnell, from the clowns out there that aren't elected, never will be to anything.  And the way he took it, as someone who started it with coolness and charm and dignity, and just took it and took it and kept moving forward and doing his job. 
[02:03:00]  And the American people, and I know we look at these percentage, 40% of the white, but fine.  That's about right among Democrats the last couple of cycles, three cycles of work.  Good work for them, good work for him, a good day for America.  I'm so glad we had that storm last week, because I think the storm was one of those things.  No, politically, I should say.  Not in terms of hurting people.  Fuck you.  The storm brought in possibilities for good politics.  Wow.  That's Matthews, Lawrence O'Donnell, the Reverend Albright.  I'm so glad we had that storm last week.  Go on, Chris. 
[02:03:30]  Radio guys get fired for that shit.  Fired.  Fucking fired.  Bob Grant said about fucking, but call me an optimist, about Ron Brown possibly being killed in a fucking plane crash, and he was fired.  Wow.  And Chris, Imus says, not beheaded hoes, he's fired.  This guy says, I'm glad there was a storm last week.  I don't care if he tried to fix it by saying politically.  A hundred people dead in that storm.  Plus all the people, their lives are completely destroyed.  What if Ron Brown said not beheaded hoes?  Wow.  What if he switched it all around?  Chris Matthews, there should be a fucking outcry about this. 
[02:04:00]  Where's the outrage?  There won't be, because he's a lefty cunt.  You can't quickly just say, I mean, politically.  No.  Wow.  He is happy.  Stay in.  That honesty came out of there.  Of course.  He was absolutely glad that that hurricane happened.  You should come to Governor's this weekend and see Jay Moore.  I really should.  He's doing a good job.  He's writing your neighborhood.  Governor's.  Across from Bulls.  Levittown.  Yes.  Colin Quinn?  Yeah.  You guys sound like you really worked up ahead of steam this morning.  Colin. 
[02:04:30]  Sorry.  You can't unring this bell, Colin.  Wow.  Colin, what's your take on the election?  Wait, we have Colin in studio.  I'm confused.  Oh, man.  Which Colin is the real one?  You really let the horse out of the barn, Anthony.  Oh, that's sick.  You're sick.  Tell me I'm sick.  Return a text.  Hi, Colin.  I love it.  What do you think of the election, Colin? 
[02:05:00]  Do I think of it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, look.  Romney shouldn't have, he shouldn't have been going, you know, changing his opinions halfway  through.  So, you know what I mean?  You think that would have made any difference in this environment?  Romney should have went on stage with a visa.  I think that, I think the American people, no matter what, are determined to prove they're  not racist.  Stop giggling.  Be a professional for crying out loud.  You know what I'm saying?  Stop talking like that.  You know what I'm saying. 
[02:05:30]  Yes.  Do I have a head injury that nobody told me about?  Why wouldn't we know what you're saying?  You just had a simple, salient point.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yes.  Even I know is a good impression, John.  You better.  It really is.  Holy fuck.  I'm going to your stomach.  I know you.  I know we just.  I know we just.  He's just scary about it.  I know.  Sorry.  I got my breathing down.  It's throwing Colin off.  Look, I know we just moved, right? 
[02:06:00]  We just had a big move.  We went downtown.  Keeping it real.  I moved downtown right before the storm hit.  No kidding.  Oh, good move.  Yeah.  Unlike Chris Matthews, I'm not very happy about the storm.  No, Chris Matthews seems to be ecstatic that there was a big storm, a deadly storm.  Perfect timing for the deadly storm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really is unbelievably dumb.  What a fucking unthought out cock.  You know, and he used to be a speechwriter or something.  You guys are unbelievable.  He used to work for Tip O'Neill when Tip O'Neill was Speaker of the House. 
[02:06:30]  You know?  Oh my God.  Yeah.  He worked for Tip O'Neill and then, you know, he does that Chris Matthews show.  I was supposed to go on it, but he got malaria somehow.  The only guy I've ever known that lives in Connecticut comes down with malaria.  I think maybe he just didn't want me on a show.  I used to be a room service waiter at the Hilton when, and at the Democratic Convention of 1980, not that I'm old, and I had to serve Tip O'Neill all his liquor all the time.  And we used to call him no Tip O'Neill because he'd never tip on it. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  Wow.  As Jimmy would say, he was a well-skinned Flint.  He really was.  He really was.  That's when John Anderson ran and got 8% of the vote.  He would have won if he put the glasses on and people thought he was Phil Donahue.  I wish you worked for room service when Dom DeLuise was in the hotel.  Well, I should have a less boring story than when I could have.  No Tip O'Neill, and I like how you explained it.  I still don't get it. 
[02:07:30]  I knew it when I got a call, a call in the show, and I knew I was going to bring it to a grinding halt.  But I figured, you know, for the fraternity, I'd call up.  But I knew I was going to bring it to a grinding halt.  What fraternity?  You never even had to pledge.  Why do I even understand?  You should, if you're going to be in the fraternity, you have to pledge.  You should be walking around Manhattan with big cherries in your ass.  Hi, I'm Colin.  I'm a nutnik. 
[02:08:00]  That was like George Dudley doing an impression of somebody.  I hope I'm taking the weight, and the show's only sort of distinct since I got on this goddamn call.  Because it's been like this all morning.  I swear to God, you guys are in trouble.  No.  I tell you what, why don't we get a hold of Rich Voss, so we can, you know, add some levity to the room.  We were talking about Pearl Harbor earlier, Colin, so it's a good thing you called up. 
[02:08:30]  More bombing.  Oh, shit.  I had to explain that one.  Colin, I got it, believe me.  Yeah, Colin, your joke went over like a bunch of lead balloons or something, you know?  Colin hates Chip.  I don't get it.  Oh, Chip stinks.  Colin, we're going to have a benefit later.  All the celebrities are going to get together to have a telethon for Chip.  Yesterday, the other day, Eddie Vedder, we found out that Chip toured with Pearl Jam because his mother, Dolores, was a big Pearl Jam fan. 
[02:09:00]  Instead of a telethon, how about an ask-a-thon?  Good.  Chip, you really are funny.  We love you.  Thanks.  I know.  All right, I'm going.  Where are you going?  You going to write your manifesto with your goddamn cardigan?  I'm good.  Chapter one, same as the other chapters. 
[02:09:30]  Maybe if I indent in double space, it'll look more.  I like it better when you do Francesco Quinn.  Francesca Quinn?  Can you do Francesco Quinn before I leave?  I don't know who that is.  From Katoon.  When he told, he said, you know, the only one that can kill Barnes is Barnes.  Oh, I thought you meant like Mike Francesa.  Oh.  No.  All right, Quinn.  Dig this, assholes, and dig it good.  Barnes been shot six times, and Barnes ain't dead.  Barnes ain't meant to die.  Taylor, I remember when you came in here, you said you admired the man. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, well, I was wrong, man.  Wrong.  You ain't never been right.  I've got nothing.  You dig this.  Nothing can go Barnes, but Barnes.  Y'all talking about death?  Y'all talking about killing?  Y'all experts?  Well, I'd like to hear about it, potheads.  Y'all smoke this shit so it's to escape from reality?  I don't need this shit.  I am reality.  This is how Anthony feels about our country, because when the machine breaks down, we break 
[02:10:30]  down, gentlemen.  And I can't handle that.  Not from warning you.  Hey, we're going to take a break, because Louis C.K. is walking down the fucking hall.  Oh, man.  I'm just a man who's here in my fucking shoes, sitting in a goddamn chair.  Right on, man.  Colin.  Colin, thank you, sir.  Bye, guys.  Jesus.  Hello?  Colin Quinn.  Hi, we're talking to Colin Quinn on the telephone.  It's fucking Colin.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Oh, he's gone.  Colin.  Colin's gone.  Are you guys still on the air?  Yes.  But we're going to take a quick break, right? 
[02:11:00]  I've never seen in my life.  Aren't we?  Thank you, man.  I was fucking...  We all wept.  That's really nice of you.  Goddamn victory weeping when Louis was on SNL.  Oh, man.  Australian sketch.  A monologue that kills.  I got questions for you, because I know the inner workings.  Oh, that's right.  Jay Moore, he's an alumni of SNL.  Why don't we take a quick break, let Louis take his coat off, and we'll get into it.  Yes.  Fucking Louis C. Case here today.  I'm so fucking happy.  Nice.  And Jay Moore.  He's just a man who's here sitting in a fucking chair.  Come by to say hi.  I'm sorry about Obama, Anthony. 
[02:11:30]  I'm sorry.  We're going to get into it after a break.  That's really my first thought was, oh, Anthony.  I know.  He's so upset.  Thank you.  Look at Colm's up there, happy as hell.  They let me on TV.  Finally.  They let me on TV.  I'll talk over Jay.  Jay Moore at Governors this weekend.  I'm sorry.  And Friday through Sunday.  We're going to continue with Louis C.K. next.  Hold the gun straight and turn the phone sideways when you take video.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Obi and Anthony show. 
[02:12:00]  Very cool.  We got Jay Moore in studio playing Governors this Friday through Sunday out there in Long  Island.  They got their power back.  And now we say hi to Louis C.K.  Hey, Louis.  Holy.  Louis Lincoln, Lincoln.  Louis is here.  Hey, guys.  Hello, gentlemen.  Jimmy told us earlier today you might stop by, and we're very, very happy you're here.  Gentlemen.  Obviously.  We want to talk about SNL, man.  Holy fuck.  Yes, I hosted it.  How were the ratings?  Do you know what the ratings were when you did it? 
[02:12:30]  They were good.  I thought they were good.  Yeah, they got, like, whatever.  I wasn't, like, a record-breaking or something, but I think it was the better of the season.  Muscle, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it was after the hurricane, and it was the election last before the election.  You know, people wanted to laugh.  They needed to laugh.  When you need to have a smile on your face, a smile will do.  Yes.  I'm still without power, by the way.  It's like my bumper sticker says...  Are you really?  Yeah.  Oh, a millionaire.  You don't have a generator of everybody in the world who's got a generator?  A generator, but I don't have the one installed yet. 
[02:13:00]  I have one going in, but they got a sink of 1,000-gallon fucking LP tank, and then a  giant boxcar train-sized generator comes in, and it takes, like, six months.  Maybe it should be nicer to piece people of color.  That would have been done already.  You think so?  Yeah.  They would have just come right in and said, let's take care of this guy.  He's one of us.  With all that happening, you know, I don't have...  A guy with as many guns as you have has to have a generator. 
[02:13:30]  I know.  I got to have a generator and fucking metal shutters that just close over the windows  and, yeah, floodlights, security cameras, scanners, emotes.  You need someone just walking the perimeter.  Perimeter walker.  That's all you need.  Cannons, you know, those riots.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Things like, boom, bang, an apartheid truck, because I've done the block.  How about South Africa actually had vehicles just for breaking up crowds of blacks?  Wow.  Like, the only country in the world.  Like, just apartheid trucks.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Like, no, this is good, because it shoots tear gas, and they can't get in.  You can drive right through the crowd.  It's nice.  That's right.  Hey, Gabe.  Now, I'm sure they haul money to the corrupt government that's in charge now.  Sure.  Well, let's talk about it.  Jesus Christ, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  It must take so much energy.  I know.  You know, hate is exhausting, Louis.  Hate is exhausting.  Wow.  Tired all the time.  Are you as bummed as Anthony is about Obama being real like this?  No, I'm very happy.  I'm very glad.  I'm certain.  You know, I don't think Romney was that. 
[02:14:30]  I wouldn't have been horrified if he wanted.  Right.  He's a good guy.  He's a nice man.  He's a decent man.  He's a kind man.  Yeah.  Sounds like Jodie Foster describing the rancher.  No, he's a good man, sir.  Yeah.  Louie, I didn't know you could do that many impressions and accents when you're doing SNL  and doing like the Australian movie sketch.  You know what?  The Australian one, I was supposed to be Bill Hader's part, the bigger part, and then we  did it in read-through, and Lauren said, let's let you do the smaller one. 
[02:15:00]  He just said it in front of everybody.  That's a post-midnight sketch.  Couldn't let Bill play the big guy, you play the other small one line?  And I was like, yeah, totally.  Why?  Were you not nailing the accent?  I wasn't nailing the accent.  That's funny, too, though.  If you're not nailing the accent, it's kind of funny.  I was good for one line, and then it started falling apart.  It sounded like Irish or Mexican or something.  Lauren protected you.  Yes, he did.  No, that's why I was pleased.  You would have been out on the wire, and people would have been going, what is this on  the internet?  Exactly.  Good for Lauren.  That's right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:15:30]  What's your thoughts on Lauren Michaels?  I love that guy.  I really do.  After a week of doing that show, I don't think you can not love the guy, because he takes really  good care of you, and you get to kind of be, I mean, he's this legendary guy.  All I know is my exposure to him, is this one week.  So if you're the host of the show, he takes care of you, he shepherds you through it,  and he also, you get to have all these dramatic Lauren moments, like there's things that are  host-only moments.  Really?  That are so fun, because like the last sketch of the show, there were supposed to be two 
[02:16:00]  more, and we only had room for, I was told by somebody, you're going to have to  choose one sketch.  Oh, wow.  He'll leave it up to you, because there's only one left.  So then they take me into, somebody comes and gets me, and says, come to the control  room.  This is while we're on the air, you know?  Holy shit.  And they go, go over there, and Lauren's waiting for me in the dark of the control room with  his arms folded, and I go over.  Petting a cat.  Yes.  That's what it was like.  And he goes, he just says simply, you can have one.  It's your choice.  And I already knew it. 
[02:16:30]  He's holding a boy and a girl.  Well, I already knew what he, about it, but because he was making such a, I was, I pretended,  I was like, oh.  Really thinking it out.  Wow.  Yeah, I knew I wanted to do the, that one.  You should have said, yeah, I know.  And then, yeah.  Somebody already told me.  You don't even run this place anymore.  You should have pointed to somebody in the control room and said, I'll have him.  I'll take that one.  I'll take that one.  What was the other option?  A sketch where I played John Tesh. 
[02:17:00]  Why'd you not?  Come on.  I don't even know.  It was a tough choice, because the John Tesh was really funny.  It was a crazy bit.  I ended up taking a chainsaw to a whole set and destroying a set with a chainsaw.  Well, they should film that anyway.  Throw it on the internet.  They probably did a dress, right?  Yeah, they did a dress, and it did well.  So maybe they said they might put it out.  Maybe they throw it up there somewhere.  That'd be nice.  You probably chose, and they were like, oh, wow.  Well, I felt bad, too, because the kid in it, this guy Tim, he was playing Dave Tesh,  my brother.  I don't think they were doing it.  And he was really funny in that he's new. 
[02:17:30]  So he would have gotten a big boost.  But so was Kate, who was in the bar sketch.  I just knew that if I licked her face on the TV, it would get big laugh.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That was great, dude.  That was a fucking rolling, massive laugh, which you don't see on.  Really fun.  Live TV that much.  Absolutely.  That's a great, like, that was the, you know, a lot of stuff goes by quickly, but that was  a moment I was able to, like, stop for.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  When I'm licking her face and people are going nuts, and you're aware this is on live fucking  television? 
[02:18:00]  Are you aware of that constantly, by the way?  Not in only a few moments, but that was one of them.  Like, this is on TV right now that I'm doing this, and I can lick her face as long as I  want, and they'd have to, like, come and get me.  And at one point, I got my nose in her mouth, and I decided, my goal in my head is I'm going  to try to get my whole head in her mouth.  And I started pushing up into her mouth with my nose, and I felt her go, oh, because she  was gagging on my nose.  Dude, if she would have vomited on you, that would have been the greatest moment in live 
[02:18:30]  TV.  But I started laughing right then, so I stopped.  It was getting huge laughs.  I went up to that, though.  I mean, every line was getting a laugh.  It was, yeah.  The open mouth kiss, which was a little obnoxious, got a huge laugh, and then right into the tug.  Jimmy, you didn't see the monologue, right?  We came into the dressing room.  I watched it with so many meetings.  The first thing Jay said when Lou walked in, just an amazing monologue.  One of the best ever.  One of the best ever.  Wow.  From being on the inside, what people don't realize is, for some reason, it's what they work 
[02:19:00]  on last.  It's like, you get like Sally Field, and all day you practice sketches, and then like  on Saturday, they're still trying to bang out a monologue, like at four in the afternoon.  And how good is, you know.  That's why the monologue's always terrible.  It's always terrible.  Well, it's really important.  Hey, waka waka.  You realize when you do it, how important it is, because you get, when they, I never thought  of this.  I always thought of each sketch as its own compartmentalized thing, but when you host the  show, you want, they need to hook into you as a person, because when you're in the  sketches, whether you're playing whatever, Mountain Man or whatever it is, they have 
[02:19:30]  to be, they have to like you to get into the sketch.  I didn't think of that.  Yeah, so that opening's pretty important.  Yeah, to kind of look at that.  Yeah, I mean, in the dress rehearsal, the monologue I did like twice the amount, so they  could look at it all and decide what to do.  And it went well, but then the first sketch I did after the monologue was a sketch that  didn't air, where I play a drawing teacher with kids, and I'm really mean.  And they hated me for it.  Really? 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Yeah, it really, it kind of fucked me for the rest of the show.  Really?  I don't think you want to say rape in your monologue.  I don't want to rape a child.  I knew that might look below 14th Street, but up here a...  Exactly.  I call a little girl a whore in that sketch.  That's hilarious.  Come on.  You would have liked it.  It was funny.  Maybe after the news...  It's like I'm doing, it's like a thing where I'm saying, you can draw anything with your  imagination.  And like, I draw three circles, and I go, this could be anything you want.  Maybe it's a robot ant.  And some kid goes, maybe it's balloons. 
[02:20:30]  And I go, it's a robot ant.  I think I was pretty clear it's a robot ant.  And then later I decide, and I start kicking the kids out one by one.  And then at the end, I go, maybe it's balloons.  This could be a pink balloon.  And this girl goes, it could be red.  And I go, it's pink, you little whore.  Oh, shit.  That's gross.  And then I get arrested by the cops.  But then the next sketch, everyone was like, boo.  Wow.  I'm so mean.  I'm surprised it got cut and not moved just after the second song.  Well, I had a chance to defend it. 
[02:21:00]  Like, Lauren took the card off the board and kind of held it.  Like, he said, this is vulnerable.  Wow.  And I said, you know what?  Just get rid of it.  We're leaving our flank open with this.  Yeah.  Wow.  So you were in the room when they picked the sketches.  No one else ever is.  It's you.  And who's the head writer now?  Seth Meyer.  And there was a decent amount of people in there.  It was, what's his name?  Kenny Amon.  Steve Higgins.  Higgins.  And a few other people whose names I don't, I didn't know.  Were there sketches that got picked that you went, whoa, I'm not sure why that's up there. 
[02:21:30]  No, I mean, the read-through was really strong.  Yeah.  There was a lot of good material.  So I liked everything they picked.  There was only two bits that I hated that I, I mean, I just don't like personally.  And they didn't, I didn't, the thing you learn after a long time is you don't have  to fight stuff right when you see it.  Yeah.  Sometimes things get taken care of on their own.  And if you fought them and then that, you know what I mean?  So there was two sketches I never liked.  They were on the board.  And I didn't say a word about them.  You mean they were on the board?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:22:00]  And then after dress, they got cut and it didn't matter.  Very happy.  Of course.  I only torpedoed one sketch and I felt bad because the writer was a nice guy and he  was sitting right there and I was saying, this is not that funny.  It's not satisfying.  Like I fought against one.  What was it?  It wasn't on.  But you had to actually come out and say, like, I guess.  The only one that I said something about, because I just didn't, I didn't, I  didn't think I was doing a good job of it too.  So.  What was the gist of the one you torpedoed?  I don't know.  That guy's a nice guy.  I don't want to fuck his life up.  Oh, okay.  I'm a big fucker.  All right. 
[02:22:30]  I want to ask you what you were, I want to ask Lou what he was thinking right before  they introed you.  Yeah.  Your heart must have been racing.  Yeah.  What goes through your fucking mind?  Well, it's really emotional because it's a whole week and I, everything I've, to me,  uh, everything I've ever done that's new, I always, I always go through, what did I  drop?  How am I immature?  Jimmy has to go, ha ha.  As Lou is trying to open up his fucking heart for everybody.  I'm sorry. 
[02:23:00]  Jesus.  Oh, thank God.  I don't know.  Don't worry about what, Phil, who gives a fuck.  It's just a remote.  It's hilarious.  What a bunch of jerks.  So you're waiting to go on camera for the first time.  Okay.  So you do all this shit and you doubt yourself like eight, 10 times during the week like this.  I'm not, I'm going to suck at this.  There's a lot of process and it's exhausting.  And then you finally get to then it's finally, you're standing behind this door and the music's 
[02:23:30]  playing and there's Don Pardo's voice saying, you know, and, uh, there's this woman named  Jenna, who's the stage director and she's, um, getting ready to, you know, she's  really serious and counting down and I said, uh, Jenna, like I, like I was urgent.  I said, Jenna.  And she goes, what?  And I scared the shit out of her because we're two seconds to me going out.  You can't do anything.  You did.  Yeah.  And I'm talking to her like there's a problem. 
[02:24:00]  And she goes, what?  And I said, I'm hosting Saturday Night Live.  Nice.  And she goes, yes, you are.  And then she, then she pushes the door open.  Asshole.  That's awesome.  But that's how I felt.  Like I, I mean, cause I'm 45 now.  So, uh, anything that you let go, that you will let go past without enjoying it.  You're a real turd.  Right.  You feel like an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I just, she's standing there.  I wanted to tell somebody I'm fucking doing this right now.  That's so fucking cool.  So I came out, I was really emotional and I was really happy. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  Uh, when I came out.  That's awesome.  You change, like being 45, you're saying like, you want to, you want to enjoy everything  as you're doing it.  Cause it's like, sometimes with an experience, it's like so fucking tense and nerve wracking.  You don't even enjoy it.  You just, you're like, okay, I'll look back on this and it will be fun instead of fucking  liking it.  You have to stop and go, this may, I may never do this again.  It's amazing.  I'm getting to do this.  Yeah.  Did you feel totally prepared after a week?  Did you feel like, okay, I'm good.  I don't feel like.  Not completely.  And I also, I was so excited. 
[02:25:00]  It's not a helpful emotion to be happy.  Yeah.  Because I sputtered the first few lines of the monologue.  I was too excited and it fucked me up.  Cause like the first joke I said was, um, the power's back on so we can go back to using  way too much electricity.  And I've done this before.  I was so excited that I'm trying to say everything too soon.  So I said the power's back on, which way, which means we can wait.  We can use way too much electricity because the word way was the first laugh. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  So I said way like six times before it was time to say it back on.  Cause I was too happy.  Yes.  You said Kurds.  Kurds and way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, and it got nothing.  And I rushed past it cause it didn't get a laugh to the next thing.  And I'm on fucking live TV.  So you're thinking you fucked up the first joke and now you're subsequently fucking up 
[02:26:00]  the second one.  And this could be a black hole that sucks the entire monologue in it.  Unless you, you know, when they burn a forest to stop a forest fire, you've got to get a  firewall in here somewhere.  And I was having that thought somewhere in the, I know where your firewall was.  Where was it?  Cause I, uh, when old lady falls down and you see her inappropriate parts.  Yes.  That was the exact moment where everybody went, fuck.  Everyone got off the hook.  Yes.  That was it.  Right.  That was the first laugh that made me feel normal. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  And then I was like, I'm going to be okay.  You said I'm so goddamn funny.  That story.  Yeah.  Did they talk to you about not breaking the fourth wall?  Cause I'm always amazed.  No one on SNL ever breaks that wall.  You mean during the sketches?  Yeah.  Did they say to you, don't do it?  Or do you, or does it just, why would he look at the fucking camera in the middle of a sketch?  No, no, no, no.  No, but I mean, nobody even does it ironically if something bombs.  Nobody, nobody does it.  He broke the fourth wall.  I did a little bit with the mountain sketch. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Because I fucked up so many things.  A couple times he broke the wall.  I made so many mistakes cause there was all these marks I was supposed to hit.  And every time we rehearsed it, I didn't go to any of them.  And then they would say really nicely, we really, we have no shot.  If you don't move the whole shot, it was like a big master.  They needed me to move down the whole sketch.  Now that I think about it, because if I had moved, they would have had a better shot.  No one had any coverage.  They wrote it on the cards in huge letters. 
[02:27:30]  They wrote, they wrote step down.  Oh, wow.  And they said, we're going to do this for you so you don't have to worry about it.  And I was like, thank you.  I know.  That's cool.  I'll see that.  And then after like three lines, I realized I haven't moved.  Oh.  That's totally fine.  But your cool beard looked great.  And then the, yeah, I had this crazy beard.  Yeah, who cares?  He looks good with long hair.  He looked awesome, man.  That's what we said.  There's nothing.  We're like, damn, Louie looks good with long hair.  There was no weak thing.  There was no, like, there's always like a hunk of shit.  Like 10 feet where you're like, ugh.  Where you're like, God. 
[02:28:00]  And you're like, now after that shit sketch, I got to go to commercial.  Then there's a fucking band.  I don't know.  After that bullshit.  There was no bullshit.  It was one of the better episodes I've ever seen.  Oh, thanks, man.  And after the one sketch, you laughed.  So he did break down the fourth wall.  The hotel sketch at the end, there was a huge laugh.  And I kind of liked that.  I want to make a point.  Hold on.  What was that about?  The kid, Bobby Moynihan, who's, that's his name, right?  Yeah.  Who's in the sketch with me.  He's a really nice guy.  And I don't know.  I just liked him.  And we were doing it all week, you know? 
[02:28:30]  Right.  That whole thing was dependent on me keeping that rhythm going.  It was another one where I just kept just misplacing little words and fucking up.  And I felt like I made so many mistakes.  But I don't know.  And I was having a good time by then.  I was really enjoying the show by then.  Yeah, the laugh was great.  And I knew we were close to the end.  And I was feeling all this cool relief and stuff, you know?  So you kind of just let it out.  $7 and $150,000.  Yeah, yeah.  And also, they had told me this thing right before we went on.  There's going to be a sound of a printer. 
[02:29:00]  And you're going to hear it jam.  And then that's when you say it jammed.  And I couldn't hear it.  I couldn't hear anything.  Oh, shit.  It was on the air, but I couldn't.  I was just standing there waiting.  And there was like this long pause on fucking live television.  And so I just picked a moment to say the printer jammed.  And then we went away with really no laugh at the end.  So I'm just pounding on this fake keyboard.  And I looked at Bobby and we both just started crashing on.  I liked it.  It was a real moment. 
[02:29:30]  Let me just say this real quick.  Whenever a comic that we kind of know or know of hosts SNL, all of us in this room,  and you have to fucking admit it, a party of your roots against a fucking guy.  Holy shit.  Louie's the only guy in my lifetime that walked through those doors and I was with him.  Like a guy.  Opie said it when I was here the other day.  Like watching Louie, it was like one of my guys.  Like I'm a fucking coach.  But like one of our guys.  Like a guy from the stoop. 
[02:30:00]  It was awesome.  It was like the moment you.  And fucking Don Pardo.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Man, you know, Paul is sure.  You know, in the party he's going to be like, I hope this fucking tanks.  But Louie, you're like, holy shit.  We were standing in the phone booth by a car going, they're going to make this fun.  Yeah, they're going to make this fun.  And then you walk through the curtains and there's just a bunch of chairs stacked up.  Oh, no. 
[02:30:30]  The only CK come out of this empty.  He must be like actually 90, right?  And there's nothing anybody could do about it.  That's that.  Yeah.  And that's that.  Yeah, he's spotted on a line.  He's a redheaded cunt and there's nothing to be done.  It was payback for Joe Dixow leaving his stage manager.  Real greaseball shit.  We were so happy for you, Lou.  In my house, we were so fucking happy.  I want to ask you about the week because it's legendary how many hours you put in and people  sleep there. 
[02:31:00]  What was your experience?  Well, I knew it's all about energy management, you know?  And my show is really hard.  But the show I do on FX, it's hard work.  So I'm used to that.  What show is that?  What show is that?  We got to talk about the Emmys.  We got so much.  I want to talk about Emmys and a book that might be.  You want Emmys, you animal.  I want a couple, you know.  But anyway, the week on SNL.  So you learn some stuff after a while.  When you're young, you can just keep regenerating. 
[02:31:30]  You don't lose power.  It just keeps coming, you know?  You can really fuck yourself up.  Like kids that are on the football team in high school and they smoke cigarettes and stuff  and they get fucked up and the next day they're gods.  And at 45, I literally knew I was capable of throwing the thing away if I wasn't careful.  So there are little simple things.  Like I didn't put any sugar in my bloodstream for the week.  Like I didn't eat any.  Yeah, no sugar.  Just like a lot of fruit, a lot of water. 
[02:32:00]  And I loved being there and there's a lot of really great guys in the show.  Bill Hader and Fred Armisen that are old friends of mine.  And so I'd find myself in the hallway talking to a couple of guys and making jokes and laughing.  And then I'd tell myself, stop it.  Go back to your room and sit down.  Wow.  Just stop doing that because that's a useless, expensive energy.  Because you work really hard all week and none of it's on television.  You're pushing and working and working and working and none of it has.  You still haven't done a single fucking thing. 
[02:32:30]  Until 1130 on Saturday, you have accomplished nothing.  Wow.  So it's, yeah, so I kind of drank a lot of hot tea and shit to keep my throat nice.  It would be great if you snapped during the monologue and just said all of this.  Like if you just said, oh, holy shit.  Next time, Jimmy.  Like if you just started saying that.  The audience is just looking at him.  Like what happens?  Is he okay?  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Vox.  Look at the black chicks checking me out. 
[02:33:00]  By the way, a lot of people have talked about the moment you hear Don Pardo say your name.  Nobody hears Don Pardo say.  You can't hear it.  No, huh?  Oh, really?  You've got the band right in your face.  That's true.  And you just see your...  Someone just starts screaming, go, go, go!  You don't hear that.  So she was super intense.  Everybody's lying when they say that they...  Intense, that lady.  Jenna?  Yeah, she's great, though.  She's a very mama kind of person.  When Joe Dixo did it from like 77 on, he was like really old.  He would go like 30 seconds away.  And then every Saturday he'd go, five seconds! 
[02:33:30]  It's like this little old man.  He thought he was having a hard...  And everybody would laugh and it was all relaxed.  So it's interesting.  Now there's like a taskmaster doing it.  She's good.  And how many hours a day are you putting in at the offices?  How long?  Well, the first, the first, the Tuesday is the first big day.  I was there until three in the morning.  And then the next day, it depends on what you're shooting and stuff.  Like the Lincoln thing that we did, it was pretty easy.  That was awesome.  Those guys did all of that.  I mean, I didn't, I didn't write any of that. 
[02:34:00]  I didn't, I did, I felt like you wrote it.  Stand up.  Yeah.  But Seth Meyers wrote it.  It was his idea, the whole thing.  And he, he even gave me the premises for the stand up.  Like he threw ideas up to me and...  Wow.  They really did it.  And they got their, their film crew, like research what cameras we used and on the show  and they matched everything exactly.  And Daryl said they were the same clothes too.  Like when they do a sketch about a politician, they were the exact same suits.  Like they're really, uh, I won't say the exact again.  The woman, uh, uh, 80 who played my, my, uh, who played Mary Todd Lincoln. 
[02:34:30]  She was wearing a dress that is at the Met Museum.  That's like, they were really uptight about the dress.  She was funny.  She was funny.  But her dress is like a national treasure.  The research department on SNL is so ridiculous.  Like you go, there's just a group when I would, I don't know when Louie obviously is a way better story,  but real quickly, there's like two desks of research people and you go, Hey, I need footage inside Apollo 18.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  And they literally like in two hours, there's like nine VHS tapes and still, and you're like, how did you find this?  There was no Apollo 18.  That's why I just pulled that out of my ass.  Yeah.  How are they going to get footage of that?  I don't think so.  Easy chip.  Hey, uh, congratulations on the Emmys too, man.  Thanks.  You want how many?  You want two?  You said Emmys too.  T-W-O.  No, no.  I meant comma T-O-O.  I know what you meant.  Did you decide to take a year off before that or after?  Before the Emmys.  Oh, you said, I'm just tired.  They didn't answer until after.  Okay.  Well, I wanted more time to do the show because I do it, I turn in episodes I know are not as good as they could be because they're just too, it's too fast. 
[02:35:30]  So I'm not taking that much time off.  I'm taking like two months off and then I'm starting to work.  I usually start working on the show in December and I'm going to start working on it in September.  So I'm getting a huge amount more time to do the same amount of work.  Oh, okay.  So it'll just be better.  Right.  That's all.  Wow.  I also wanted to stop for a bit.  I got to also ask, look at the boat.  What happened with your boat?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was all of a sudden like, wow, Louie's like a tabloid guy. 
[02:36:00]  He's rocking Louie CK in his boat just hanging out waiting to be rescued.  I got stuck in the mud.  New Black Crows album.  It was my first day in the boat.  Stuck in the mud.  I just bought it and I spent one day on it with some guy.  He showed me the specifics of the boat.  But it's this big fucking boat with two engines and it's really complicated to drive.  And I took my girls out on it. 
[02:36:30]  And as we were pulling out of the marina, my daughter was like, how do you know how to do this?  Oh, shit.  And I was like, it's not that big a deal.  Like, I was defensive with my 10-year-old.  It's not that big a deal.  I can do this.  And we went around Manhattan and I got in all this shit I had no qualifications to deal with.  It's a crazy waterway because the currents, especially, what do they call that fucking one?  It's an actuary.  Don't they call it devil's something?  It's like something.  Hell's gate.  Hell's gate.  That's right.  Right on the top. 
[02:37:00]  It converges right there.  They should call it water gate.  It's where the river is kind of split.  Thanks, Sam.  The Long Island Sound collides with the Harlem River.  Right, right.  That's it.  It gets a little dicey over there.  It's really bad.  Don't say the Harlem River around Anthony today.  No.  I'm all right.  A little sensitive.  It's been a renaissance up there.  Don't say Muddy River.  One moment when we were in that cauldron and we just smashed, like, the boat felt like it  was coming apart.  Boom!  And my seven-year-old screamed and her sister held her eyes, like, closing them.  It was like, this is really stressful. 
[02:37:30]  Were you panicking?  I don't know.  I mean, it's nervy.  It was making that smack sound on the water.  The bow goes like, bam!  It was really bad.  It's where the Harlem River meets the Long Island Sound.  The Long Island Sound, the East River, the Harlem River.  It swirls in such a way you've never seen before.  It's crazy to go through that area.  And you get whirlpools.  Pick up by Yankee Stadium?  You get all kinds of, like, a lot of lumber.  No, no, on the East Side.  It's fucking lumber floating around.  Not far from there.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it is.  Yeah, Yankee Stadium's on the East Side.  It's crazy to navigate that.  It's just north of Roosevelt Island.  Yeah.  Correct.  And are you thinking, I just want somebody who knows how to do this here right now with me? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then we went up to the Harlem River, which is very, it's like glass.  It's really nice.  And so now we got through it, and we're really happy.  And I've got frozen burritos and macaroni and cheese.  So we're going to pull over, throw the anchor, and we're going to make lunch.  And so I find this little cove, this sweet little cove.  Nice.  In Harlem?  Yeah.  And there's people in a park next to it, and it's just a nice place. 
[02:38:30]  So I pull in there, and the boat just stops moving all of a sudden.  And everything starts beeping because the boat is cooled by water that it's sitting in.  So now it's just sucking mud up into this.  Oh, fuck.  And this two-hour-old engine are now packed with mud.  And I just shut everything off because I know everything's overheating.  Oh, man. 
[02:39:00]  And my daughters go, what's going on?  And I turned to them, and I said, you need not to ask me any questions for a little while.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And a park ranger calls over to me from the shore, and he says, you ain't going anywhere.  It's low tide.  You're going to be stuck there for a long time.  And I'm like, no, no, no.  It's all right.  It's all right.  I try not to let my daughters hear this.  And I call the Coast Guard, whatever, the Channel 16.  I'm like, anybody can tow me out of here.  And these cops show up on the boat, and they're like 50 yards away, and they're not going 
[02:39:30]  to come anywhere near me.  And they said, yeah, you're going to have to wait until high tide.  Like you're infectious.  Yeah.  It's around 1 o'clock, and I'm on the radio with the cops, and they go, you're going to  have to wait until high tide.  And I said, when's that?  And they said, maybe midnight.  Oh, no.  Both my daughters start crying.  Did you stay the whole time, or did you get out?  You can't.  There was no way to get out.  Because in a few minutes, we were surrounded by mud, and it was like quicksand. 
[02:40:00]  Like I put a stick in it, and it just fell into the mud.  Were you embarrassed?  Fucking embarrassed.  That's one of the best questions I've ever heard.  Quick, salient, succinct.  Oh, man.  I was really embarrassed.  So you were pretty much just like, no more water.  Your boat is sitting in muck.  Mud.  In mud.  Really gross.  You were waiting for the tide to come back in.  Were you afraid that it was just going to be stuck in the mud and not come up? 
[02:40:30]  I was afraid of that.  I was afraid of that.  My daughter was like, what if we keel over?  What if we start tipping over?  I'm like, that can't happen.  And in my head, I'm like, that could totally happen.  Totally happen.  And the cops said they would go get us food.  Because we couldn't cook any of the food now, because it needs a generator to run in the  oven.  Throw it to you.  Oven.  How would they get it to you?  Well, that was a big deal.  Because they went and got us food.  The cops.  They bought us a whole chicken and some rice.  Really nice guys.  Then they come back, and now there's a huge expanse of mud between us and them. 
[02:41:00]  And the food.  And they go, we don't know how you're going to get this.  They put it in a garbage bag.  And I start throwing a line to them.  But it's not making it.  Of course not.  All these people on the shore, everybody knows who I am now.  Oh, no.  So there's people in the park, in the shore, who are just on a rail, just watching me.  And I'm throwing this, like I've tied a pot to the rope.  And I throw it.  And it gets about halfway there.  And I pull it back, and I'm covered in mud. 
[02:41:30]  Because every time the rope comes back, it's totally covered in mud.  And I have to get the mud off, so it's not heavy.  Every time I go to throw it, all the people on the side, half of them are going,  we'll pull it for you, Louie.  You can do it.  And then when I miss, they go, oh, man.  That dude sucks.  It's like playing left field for the Yankees.  It's totally the Yankee Stadium crowd.  People booed.  People booed.  Wow.  And I couldn't get it.  So finally the cops pulled over a guy who was fishing. 
[02:42:00]  And they used his rod to throw me away.  They cast a line.  They cast a weight over me.  Oh, nice.  I tied it to a rope.  Oh, shit.  And then I had to pull dinner onto the boat.  I was so soaked in mud and sweat.  Totally.  Then it was chicken mole after that.  That's right.  Had your kids calmed down by that point?  They were great.  My kids were amazing.  Then what happens at midnight?  We waited and waited once in a while.  It started raining a little bit.  And I heard from the darkness in the park, some kid go, hey, Louis, C.K., it's raining out now. 
[02:42:30]  This is a crazy asshole.  The guys at the marina where I keep the boat, they're really cool guys.  And they sent some kid, some young guy in a boat.  And they just dropped him in the water.  And he swam to us.  Jesus.  Crazy kid.  And he came on board with me and helped me get it out.  Once the water came up, we used the bow thruster to shove the boat around. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, you got a little bow thruster on there.  Were you feeling it rise as the water was coming?  Like, oh, God, this section.  No, the boat wasn't moving because the water was coming up and the boat was just sitting there.  Stucked in the mud.  So that's why we used the bow thrusters or above the mud.  Shake it loose.  Wow.  So we shook the boat around.  Whoa.  And it worked.  At one point, the tide was starting to go down again.  And the guy that was with me said, it's your call, but we could put it in, we could turn  the engines on and put it in reverse and try to get out of here.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  It was like Apollo 13 because everything had been off for a long time. 
[02:43:30]  And now we're like, he says, we have 10 seconds of battery.  It was all this stuff.  Yes.  So we fired up and just put it in reverse.  And mud just bleh.  It was crazy.  We don't have enough limbs to get Louie out of the mud.  Any damage to the boat?  It's pride.  My propeller was, yeah, my propeller was bent a little.  Two hours.  But now the hurricane threw my boat into a street somewhere.  Are you serious? 
[02:44:00]  The hurricane fucking told your boat.  I don't know.  They said that nobody.  I was just the morning where they had it.  They said all boats came off their blocks because the surge came up under the boats.  Fucking Captain Louie.  And they said all boats were damaged.  I think God is telling you not to have a boat, though.  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to find another hobby.  You've got to find another hobby.  You've got to find another hobby.  You've got to go around Somalia.  Somalia.  Now, Louie, didn't you have a depth gauge indicator that would go like meh when you get in shallow 
[02:44:30]  water?  Yeah.  The mud happens so suddenly.  You have to know the waters.  And you need to look at your charts.  Right.  You can't just look at the depth finder.  And the tributaries.  You have to know them as well.  The depth finder tells you what the depth is directly under you.  Directly under your boat, right.  So you can tell you what's coming.  You'll just go up on it and then it'll...  If you knew it was coming, he wouldn't be near Harlem.  You're just going out there trying to catch Walter.  And, you know, fucking you and Billy hit the rock. 
[02:45:00]  What?  On Golden Pond.  When fucking Catherine Hepburn comes out with her fucking head boogging.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That is fucked up, Louie.  It was a funny...  Jesus.  Well, my girls went through this whole thing with me.  As we came into the...  We went down the Hudson River to go home at midnight.  And I said to my daughter, we have to come back out on the boat so you can have a positive  experience.  Right.  And she said, we just did have a positive experience.  Oh, that's nice.  Plus, they got to stay up late.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Well, they don't like staying up late.  They're 10 and 7.  Yeah.  They just want to go to sleep.  Is there a downstairs on the boat?  I got a 10-year-old.  He's like, stares at the TV all night.  Does he?  Well, he's a boy.  Yeah, he can't stop doing Colin.  Stares at the TV all night.  Why don't we take a break?  Louis C.K.'s here.  Watching C-Span.  I'm like a weirdo.  Jay Moore is at Governor's starting Friday.  All right?  All right.  And I'm in Texas.  Friday through Sunday.  And Jimmy's at the Addison Improv in Texas.  I'm at Governor Connelly's.  In two weeks.  In two weeks. 
[02:46:00]  He gave me the cue.  I didn't know you were done.  Didn't you see my lips moving?  Yeah, just go.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul tells us about teaching karate. 
[02:46:30]  My friend was a karate teacher.  You'd get in there and everybody would take off our clothes.  Yeah, let me show you the crane.  Give Sensei Paul a kiss.  Shh.  Get over here and drink Uncle Paul's snake oil.  Judo, judo.  Chop, chop, chop.  Chop your penis.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare. 
[02:47:00]  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  SiriusXM.  SiriusXM.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  You guys eat. 
[02:47:30]  Everybody's eating.  SiriusXM and Anthony Show were blowing up.  I yelled at Iraq.  I'm like, come back.  What are you doing?  It's fucking 9.35 already.  He's like, well, they want material.  9.35.  We go as long as we want.  Yeah.  Go as long as you want, honey. 
[02:48:00]  I gotta go back home and power my house back up.  Every morning when I leave, I power it down.  I turn off the generator.  And then when I go home, yeah, and that's exactly what it's like.  Five seconds to total shutdown.  I was telling him I went through a generator the other day.  Saturday, my generator just fucking died.  And it's like, you're sitting inside.  You get used to the sound of the generator.  And then it just goes, oh.  It's quiet and the lights go out and you're all fucking back in the, just like a caveman again. 
[02:48:30]  But I think Louie had the best point about you, Anthony.  Of all people, how are you not like Mr. Generator when the storm's rolling?  He's hooking that up.  He's going to have a, you're going to have a thousand fuel, a thousand gallon fuel tank.  You're a doomsday scenario guy, right?  A thousand gallon fuel tank, by the way.  That's good for how, like with three days.  That's the crazy thing.  Yeah, exactly.  I think no one wanted to, so they were just refused to take the moment of the hurricane  to realize how much fuel we use. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  People downtown, really cool, green people downtown, didn't just refuse to notice.  It's like, people are sitting with generators, like in the middle of the Greenwich Village.  There's a generator, it's fucking, it's just pissing through gas to charge up three iPhones.  Like, when you plug your iPhone into the wall, so that you can do really cool apps about how  green you are and how liberal you are, you are burning fucking tons of gallons of Arab 
[02:49:30]  fuel.  Of fuel.  It's so fucking, it's just hypocritical.  And you also realize when there's no fuel at gas stations, and then there's, one opens  up, the long lines that are out there, you start realizing how much fuel people go through  when all the gas stations are open.  That's right.  It's a huge amount.  Crazy.  It's insane.  I am in a position now where today, I'm dipping below a quart of tank of gas in my truck. 
[02:50:00]  I only have one more jug of gas for the generator.  And my whole existence for the past eight fucking days has been, where do I get fuel today?  It's like the road warrior.  You're just constantly trying to find fuel.  Was this storm, this was worse than Katrina, right?  Well.  No, no, no.  The storm.  Not the repercussions.  The storm itself.  The storm itself.  No, no.  It was a Frankenstorm.  It was a category five or four.  Katrina was a category three when it hit land.  Yeah, this was a one. 
[02:50:30]  Which is unheard of for land.  It's where it hit.  Yeah, and they were underwater.  Like, they're below sea level, their whole fucking city.  Well, they started below sea level.  So I was curious if Katrina was worse or this one was worse.  Just the storm itself.  I use my hands to show you guys what I mean.  Yeah, but it was a separate storm.  When you look at the superdome filled with people shitting themselves.  But that's the repercussions.  I'm at me with a generator.  The actual weather, which one weather-wise?  Well, Staten Island is a wreck.  Somebody answer my questions.  I'm tipping this fucking table. 
[02:51:00]  Katrina, I'm telling you, Katrina was worse.  It was a three or a four.  It had to be worse.  And this one was maybe a one or a tropical storm.  It kept getting downgraded and then back up.  But there were other factors that made this, as they're calling it now, the superstorm.  You can't just say that it was a one hurricane.  No, it's a different story.  It bumps in its neck.  The location was crazy because between Long Island and Jersey, the water just backed up in there.  There was nowhere for it to go.  Just pushing that water.  And just went everywhere over the barrier islands and everything.  Who could have used this when his boat hit mud?  Could have used it. 
[02:51:30]  The storm was worse.  This one was.  Because it happened to me.  Right.  Because you were directly involved.  Really.  This was worse.  Fucking had to cancel two shows.  The Katrina.  The Katrina.  The Katrina.  He's sitting here with an egg in his beard.  And we haven't found Lou's boat yet?  No, I haven't found the boat.  You want people to find your boat for you?  What's that?  I know.  Can you tell?  I don't know if you will.  I'll just ask, though.  Yeah.  The name of the boat and how much it cost you that it's now just somewhere.  I know he'll answer one of those. 
[02:52:00]  I know.  I don't think he'll do the question.  Yeah, the name of the boat was Dogs.  Dogs.  With a G or an S or a Z?  It was...  With an S or a Z.  No, fuck you.  You said G first.  Yeah, I did.  But I...  D-A-W-G-Z.  How many foot?  34 feet.  34?  We know about.  I got a pretty good idea.  That's a fucking two-meter.  I got a pretty good idea.  Wow.  That's a big nut.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, what did you...  Why Dogs?  Because somebody called me and said they're shipping it right now, and someone's standing 
[02:52:30]  there with a spray can.  You got to come up with a name.  He got to come up with a name now.  And I was busy, and I said, ah, Dogs.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That's it.  Works.  And I forgot I did it, and when I went to take the boat out of Linenhurst, I'm like,  wow, what did I say?  Yeah.  I know.  A better name would have been, I'm a non-captain cunt.  So, what do you do?  Do you pick it up on a trailer hitch, or do they ship it to where you want it? 
[02:53:00]  I don't know.  I don't know how it works.  It was being kept in...  It's a little big for a...  Oh.  It was being kept in Jersey City.  Okay.  Back down a fucking slip.  Yeah.  A fucking...  Yeah.  You don't...  You're in the Raritan River.  You don't launch that.  Come on, son.  You take it down to the local boat ramp at Ashroken and dump it up.  Let's catch some sunnies.  Yeah.  Some sunnies.  The bluegills are all over the place.  Hey, who knows where the bass are, right, kid?  Snappies.  Yeah, with your girlfriend in cut-off shorts pretending to help while you're launching  it.  You're cranking that. 
[02:53:30]  I didn't know it.  Just don't do it.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's fucking...  That's a pretty big-sized boat for your first boat.  Yeah.  I mean, I've had smaller boats.  Oh, you have?  Little motorboats and stuff.  Yeah.  I never had a thing like that.  Two engines, you gotta fucking work those.  No, it's got a spinning...  It's got a radar.  Right, right.  Nice.  That spinny thing is cool as fuck.  Everything but a mud detector.  Everything but a competent user.  Yeah, in the hands of an asshole, a total, worthless piece of fiberglass. 
[02:54:00]  But it was in the post, I think.  It was funny.  Yeah, it was.  We saw the pictures and we're like, oh, no.  It's a better story, though.  It's so much...  I had a great trip around Manhattan.  Who cares?  I got stuck in the mud.  That's a great story, man.  That's exactly right.  Beach, there's fans on the fence like that.  Yelling at you?  That's right.  It seems so.  Hey, Louis CK, it's starting to rain now.  You should have bought a robot ant.  It was like a little kid, like a little Puerto Rican kid.  Hey, Louis CK.  He didn't know...  Like somebody told him who that was.  It's starting to rain. 
[02:54:30]  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  You should rename the boat to Follies.  That's a good one.  Jesus.  Now we're supposed to have more shit today, which...  When does that shit start?  Yeah, like this afternoon.  It's already getting a little gusty out there.  50, 60 mile an hour winds coming back.  I'm kind of glad they didn't turn my fucking power on, because it just would have gone out today.  My power goes out constantly.  But it's going to take something like six months to put this generator in.  Because I need all kinds of fucking permits and shit. 
[02:55:00]  It's for next year.  Yeah.  And then they've got to bury something that's akin to a submarine for the fuel.  And then truck in this giant generator.  Tie it into my house.  But then, when the power goes out, the entire...  And I mean everything.  I could turn every single electrical device on in my house, and this handles it.  How long does a full tank last, though?  About two minutes, three minutes.  Something like that.  A couple weeks, maybe?  No, it's...  At full blast, I would assume 1,000 gallons of liquid propane.  Someday, an archaeologist is going to go through your neighborhood, like thousands of years from now. 
[02:55:30]  And they're going to find your house with that tank, that 1,000-gallon tank.  And they're going to be like, this must have been the king of the whole...  This man must have been the ruler.  But they're going to find a skeleton alone in the house.  He was very proud of his various weapons.  He's surrounded by them.  Subjects all left him before the invasion, like leaves falling from a tree.  Oh, by the way, some of Long Island has already lost power. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, already?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Watch this.  That's coming in by a few people.  Just to shove it up my ass for governors.  That's why we were born and raised, and every time the wind blows, the fucking power goes out.  See, I'm from Jersey, and every single fucking time.  Why is that?  Why wouldn't you guys have a more...  Because they don't cut down the trees, and the wires are above ground.  A bunch of Italians can't get together and go, this is what we're going to do about the power.  Yeah.  It's going to be a bad, bad week for Staten Island.  Yeah, Staten Island.  Long East? 
[02:56:30]  They got nothing.  Staten Island.  I'm going there to do a couple of shows at the St. George, I think this Saturday before Thanksgiving.  Oh, yeah?  There's a place called the St. George Theater.  Oh, nice.  So I'm going to do two shows there.  I think we're going to give half the tickets to people locally, a way that they can come,  and then the other half for raising money.  You can do that when you're a big shot.  It's the best medicine you get to do.  I'm handing out my CDs if anybody wants them.  Just to make you feel better about your own lives here.  I actually put this out and thought it was good. 
[02:57:00]  Jimmy goes, I'm handing these out.  $10, please.  The money's going to go to the fucking relief, some drug addict, as she takes my cum.  Holy shit.  Sorry, I like prostitutes.  What do you think, they're college grads?  They're fucking druggies.  Who else would come to my house during the hurricane?  You bet I did.  He did get one.  He got one during the hurricane.  Yeah, she charged an extra $50 because she said the cabbies were price gouging her.  Yeah.  I'm like, all right.  But he got one in the middle of the hurricane.  He said, no.  That would have been so mean.  No.  You'd pay it. 
[02:57:30]  While people were losing their boats and homes, Jimmy was able to get a fucking...  Yeah, get a hooker.  Young lady to his house.  Well, hopefully.  Allegedly.  Yeah, allegedly.  Any water play?  No, no, no.  There's enough water play outside.  Thank you very much.  Boom.  You didn't lose power, did you?  You're still in the same place, right?  Yeah, no.  Uptown.  But my kids were with me.  Some friends from downtown came and stayed with me and stuff.  Oh, you let people...  What was Jay about to say?  I just answered like he was talking to me.  Obviously, he was talking to me.  No. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Nothing.  What I usually say.  Did you lose power?  No.  In the Pacific Palisades?  No.  We actually gained power.  Everything got viral on it.  It was a big surge.  A big white person surge.  A big...  If you get on a sitcom, buy a house here surge.  And then your show gets canceled and your house goes into fucking syndication.  You're like, oh my God.  The mortgage never stops.  It's like mash.  All right.  And yeah, this other storm coming up now, I had to tie in an extension cord to my generator 
[02:58:30]  and wire it into my panel for heat.  It's been like 40 degrees and shit.  So, you know, and I was taking the advice of people on Twitter.  Jesus.  So just unscrew the front of your electrical panel, right?  Look for the breaker for the furnace.  Just unscrew it, tie it together with a piece of an extension cord, the black wire in there.  Take the white one, put it on with the rest of the white ones, and then keep blacks and  whites separate on them. 
[02:59:00]  Because even with electricity, it's very dangerous to combine the black and the white.  You get to fire.  And then just plug it into the generator.  And there you go.  And the furnace turned on.  I'm like, hey, nice.  But it looks like it's going to just catch on fire any minute of the day.  It's jerry-rigged?  It doesn't look good.  You jerry-rigged it?  That's not to code at all.  No, not to code.  You jerry-rigged it?  But you've got to turn the mains off, too, because you could backfeed into the line  and electrocute a guy that's working on the fucking wires down the line.  That's the price he pays. 
[02:59:30]  Which, after eight or nine days without power, I really don't give a shit about the life  of a guy getting zapped by my inner ear.  He went to ICDC college.  That's what you get.  ICDC?  Which one was that?  Internet college is regional, I suppose.  Yeah, it probably is.  It's like an apex tech here.  Everything you're explaining is like you live in a wagon train.  Everybody circle around.  We're going to make coffee.  It's fucking crazy.  I'm literally completely surprised that you, of all people, how did you not knuckle down  and see this coming? 
[03:00:00]  You seem like the guy that would have a generator.  You knuckled down.  You just didn't think it was going to be nine days.  Yes.  And with the looting and stuff, I make sure I'm constantly armed around my house.  Is there looting in your neighborhood?  Not a single peep of looting in my neighborhood.  And maybe it's the fact that you run around your house like Mickey Rourke and Barfly.  It's kind of hard to fucking get together and hook that generator up when you're fucking  face down in the linoleum at fucking three in the afternoon.  There's all the times they've come to put it in and you're like, go away! 
[03:00:30]  Go away!  Who the fuck is you?  You're fucking naked with a gun.  We have this.  We had an appointment.  Go away!  Go away!  Not now!  Shh!  It's okay, honey.  Has there been any looting in this storm?  Yeah.  Some would say.  Coney Island.  What about last night on the internet?  I'm reading that there was Black Panthers in Philadelphia and the National Guard was coming.  One guy.  It was one guy.  It was one Black Panther guy.  And for some reason, he was also...  Why would that intimidate anybody?  That would make me laugh.  He was a Democratic observer. 
[03:01:00]  So he was actually supposed to be there as an observer and a Black Panther just standing  there.  It supposedly intimidates people for some reason.  But it was an all-black neighborhood, all-black school where this polling was being done.  So he wasn't really intimidated.  Obama mural at one of the polling places.  People lost their shit.  Yeah, they covered it up the paper.  When I was voting, I was in a long line.  And this guy comes up to me.  I did this joke on the SNL monologue about the old lady in the airport. 
[03:01:30]  And I'd say that she was probably a refugee at some point.  And I'd paint this picture of, like...  My husband died!  She's on a muddy road.  And she's got some kid with a big Jewy hat.  I could have...  That surprised me when you said that.  They actually said to me...  Somebody said to me, standards complain.  But, you know, it's live.  Do what you want.  So I did it.  So I did it.  That's fantastic.  And then, anyway, so some guy comes up to me in line while I'm voting with...  I'm with my daughter.  And this guy comes up, a big kind of heavy guy.  And he's got a lift. 
[03:02:00]  And he's just sort of weird.  And he's just kind of aggressive.  And he goes, hey, you're that comedian, aren't you?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, oh, sure, you're funny.  But what's a Jewy hat?  And everybody turns and looks at me.  Holy shit.  And I just look at him.  And he goes, I'm a Jew.  Do I have to wear a Jewy hat?  Oh, God, no.  This did not happen.  It did happen.  Holy shit.  And I just looked at him with no expression.  And then he got nervous. 
[03:02:30]  I think he was hoping that I would go, hey, I have a right.  Right, right.  And then it was really awkward.  You should have said it's a baseball cap with a K on the front.  Or a J.  It's a hood.  Or an H.  Do I have to wear one?  Yeah.  Jewy hat.  Well, you do.  Oh, God.  You're very Jewy.  No, I don't know.  I didn't say anything.  Yeah.  What are you going to say?  That's kind of weird.  You defuse things well.  I thought, like, I would have been self-righteous ass. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But that's Louie's.  It would have been a First Amendment fucking speech right there.  Well, you don't have to say anything yet.  I figured just look at him and see what happens.  What's he going to do now?  Yeah.  Now, your move still.  Yeah, exactly.  He didn't have a follow-up.  He thinks that, okay, now you talk.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, no, I don't have to say something else.  It's like passing your turn in Scrabble.  Bye.  Yeah.  And then he went outside, and that was the end of it.  And then he went on with his life.  Told eight people how shit I said that I didn't say, probably. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, I'm sure it was, you know.  And then he said, how dare you?  And I said, here's how I dare.  He said, I had horns.  He'll think twice before he makes another Jewy joke.  I think I said him straight.  Yes.  The list was bad, huh?  Yes.  He probably, I don't want to say it on the air, but he was probably a, probably a, a homosexual?  Yeah.  A pitcher?  I'm doing the limp wrist.  Homosexual.  We got an observation from a guy in Tampa. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, good.  This is going to be pretty good for Louis C.K.  It's Jay in Tampa.  Jay?  Hey, Elf.  I go back to BAB with you, man.  Long time.  Long fucking time.  Nice.  Well, we love you.  Yeah, I just got a question for you.  How is it, uh, Joey can land at DT 10 and float it down the Hudson and you get fucking  stuck?  How does it, Joey land at DT 10?  Oh, Sully to the plane.  Sully can land at the plane in the Hudson.  Very good observation.  You got stuck in the mud.  Two hours in.  That's an excellent observation. 
[03:04:30]  Sully.  I don't think you would appreciate the complexities of navigating a 34-foot meridian.  It's very complicated.  Sully landed in the Hudson River.  No one died.  That is a great point.  He did a better job with a 737 on the water.  He did it with a brand new boat.  Two cheese sandwiches.  Two cheese sandwiches.  Why are we happy that his boat's all fucked up?  Because it's hilarious when a fucking yacht gets wrecked. 
[03:05:00]  It's great.  I don't know why.  What's better than your shitty friend gets a boat and then fucking winds up in the paper  because it's in the mud?  You're shitty, Matt.  That's great.  You're shitty, Fred.  I was so close.  The only thing that made me anxious about it being in the paper was that I don't want  people knowing that I have a fucking boat.  That's true.  Well, you don't anymore.  It's a Louis C.K.'s yacht.  It's on Slimfield Avenue in Clifton.  And all these people online commented and said, that's not a yacht.  Not a yacht.  That's a pleasure craft, perhaps.  Yes, there was a disappointment on Louis C.K.'s boat. 
[03:05:30]  Boston Whaler.  Lefty thought that he was going to meet Sam of Traffic County, but a long way to go  for a fucking Donnie Blasco joke.  Hey, so what?  I didn't even think you got there yet.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, dude, I got my yacht.  You blow it up.  You put the wooden seat on.  You go fishing.  Did you take Bob Kelly on the boat?  I took Bob Kelly on the boat.  Oh, man.  You know what, dude?  Just me and Louis on the boat, dude.  Look at this.  What do you think?  Just two fucking professionals talking it over.  Shithead, you were probably the only one available.  Did you bottom out that time, too, at 1,000 feet of water?  Yeah, you were the fucking 18th person he called. 
[03:06:00]  Bobby, these for you.  How was the trip with Bob Kelly?  I went to the comedy cellar, and he was there, and I said, let's go to this.  In a boat?  Nice.  Oh, we were hoping that you weren't on your boat, and all of a sudden you ran over him,  and the propeller hit his back, and he popped up.  Manatee.  Yeah.  Manatee.  He's got the swirly fucking scar on his back. 
[03:06:30]  I dare to smake.  Kind eyes.  I went out on it one night.  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it one night.  Chris didn't want to go, and he came anyway.  And we went out to the Statue of Liberty, and there was this thing floating in the water.  Chris saw it.  He said, what is that?  And it was this big thing, and it was dark.  It was night.  It was like one in the morning.  So it looked like a raft from a ship, you know, like a big round raft.  That's what it looked like to me.  Yeah.  And I yelled over, hey, is anyone in that boat? 
[03:07:00]  And it didn't have any lights or anything.  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us, like kind of with some speed.  And Chris goes, get the fuck away from that thing.  Like it was creepy.  What was it?  I backed away from it, and I put a light on it, and it was like, it looked like a giant  manhole cover sticking out of the river.  This was the weirdest night of fucking ever.  And it's right by the-  Nautical mystery.  Yeah, right by the Statue of Liberty.  It's like, I don't know, 20 feet across, and it's moving. 
[03:07:30]  It's propelling through water.  Are you sure it was moving, or it didn't just look like it?  It was leaving a wake.  Wow.  What the fuck?  So, I call up Channel 16, and I go, is anyone monitoring this channel?  Because the Staten Island Ferry was very close to there, and I thought, it could easily sink  this, any ferry.  I would have sunk if I had hit it.  Really?  Had you backed away from it by the time you called in?  Yeah.  And so, I called in, and then this woman came on.  This is a New York Harbor Coast Guard. 
[03:08:00]  Give me your home number.  I mean, your phone number, if you have a phone.  So, I give her my number, and this guy calls, and he says, what are you seeing?  And I describe it, and he goes, describe it as well as you can.  And my manager, I said, what does that look like?  He goes, I'm really sorry, but it looks like a submarine.  It looks like the top of a, like the hatch of a submarine.  So, I go, I don't want to cause a problem, but it looks like the hatch of a submarine, and  it's headed towards lower Manhattan.  Like, that's actually, that's what I'm seeing, and I'm sure it's not that.  But, my main concern is, it's not lit, and it could cream anything that hits, it's going 
[03:08:30]  down.  And the guy goes, alright, well, I'll call a boat, and send them to you.  So, he hangs up, and like, 20 minutes later, there's nobody there.  And I call him back, and we have the light on it, and I have this weird feeling, like,  is it going to shoot at us?  Like, what is this thing?  Like, we were really freaking out.  A torpedo fucking star is coming at you.  Yes.  Chris Rock fell asleep.  Like, he's just like, you guys are idiots, and he went to sleep.  Are you wearing light vests?  That's white people's shit.  You don't wear light vests?  No.  No, I don't usually.  The kids do.  Observe water safety. 
[03:09:00]  What are you, a fucking quent?  Never put on a life jacket again.  Take a bat to the radio.  Submarine in the water.  Hard submarine.  So, anyway, we call, I call back, and they're not sending anybody, and I, at one point, I  got crazy, and I was like, I said, what are you, what do you do if somebody's, you are  the Coast Guard, and I am saying to you now, there's a, there's a submarine attacking  lower Manhattan.  I'm saying it.  This is like Jimmy's story with the bus, only on the water.  Yes.  When you were calling for the stolen bus.  It's like, how would, why wouldn't, if that did happen, someone would see it and call 
[03:09:30]  in, and they're like, we're trying to get park police over here.  I'm like, send a fucking helicopter.  We know about it, Mr. CK.  How do you know my name?  How do you know my name?  Right.  They knew exactly what this thing was.  Oh, wow.  And he kept asking me to hover.  We kept hovering around it and stuff, and then finally this big police boat comes and shines  like a massive light on it, and then he calls, hails me on the radio, hey, Captain, are you  the one who, Captain, who reported this? 
[03:10:00]  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, it's a mooring ball.  It's been there since 1965.  It's just a fucking, and I go, I'm really sorry.  I'm really sorry I wasted your time.  You didn't know?  You've never seen a bunch of moorings dancing?  No.  I know, I know.  That was delicious.  Well, you thought it was Sean Connery defecting.  How are you supposed to know?  A mooring ball. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, big iron fucking floating.  Yeah, it's on a chain.  Yeah, I guess people tie up to it.  Yeah, and I'm like, what if you don't see it?  And everybody, the guy on the, well, most people navigating those waters know what the  fuck they're doing.  Right.  That's why.  It's probably marked on a chart that there's a mooring ball there.  But when you were off to the side getting away from it, because you initially said it  was coming towards you, leaving away.  It looks like it was going towards me, because it's on a chain to the bottom.  Yeah.  So when the current takes it, it looks like it's moving.  It's not just drifting or bobbing.  I was going to say, it must have, like, just the river moving, the current. 
[03:11:00]  I have no business being on the water, because it looks like it's moving in one direction  to me, because I'm fucking moving.  So it's making, like, a circle, and I keep moving around it, and I'm going, holy shit,  where the fuck are we?  It's going towards...  Jeez, we're really moving far away now.  There's a giant thing coming out of the water.  That's the Statue of Liberty, you idiot.  It's like a floating sea from another planet.  That's Manhattan.  New York City. 
[03:11:30]  It's Atlantis!  I'm sorry.  I found Atlantis!  I said that I thought Anthony would have said it.  That's fucking funny, man.  I love your boat stories.  They're fucking great.  There's no one that shouldn't have a boat fucking more than Louie.  It's fun.  It's fun as shit, to be honest.  Would you have sunk if you hit that, though?  That would have killed him?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at the Statue of Liberty to show it off to  Chris and them.  Well, why don't they have a light on a mooring ball?  Because everybody that's actually out in the open New York Harbor is... 
[03:12:00]  I'm the only idiot in the whole New York Harbor.  They know it's there.  I'm the only asshole.  It has some tape on it, some reflective tape.  Yeah.  They said it, you know...  But, yeah, they don't expect some asshole.  Submarines put reflective tape on their hatches.  They do.  They like to be seen at night.  I'm sure if you...  Don't trip when you're coming off stage on the submarine.  Put some electrical tape down so you can see it when you're coming off on the steps.  Tape down the cable.  I'm sure if you looked at where you were and looked at a chart, it would probably be there.  Probably.  Like mooring ball number 625. 
[03:12:30]  And if a big tanker wants to sit there, it just hits the ball.  Yeah, then they just, instead of dropping an anchor...  Is that because it's too deep, this way it prevents it from going to the shallower water  to get close, it can do it in the deep water?  Yeah, it's simpler.  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down.  Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.  You just hook up to it and you're there.  How heavy is a fucking mooring ball that it can keep a ship in place?  What's it lats into the water with?  It's massive.  How big was this thing?  Big chains.  How big was it?  A safety pin.  What?  How could it be that heavy in a float?  Well, like any, you know, like a ship, like an aircraft carrier is pretty heavy. 
[03:13:00]  It's a big, hollow ball.  It has buoyancy.  Full of air.  Buoyancy.  And at the bottom, it's a giant fucking anchor of cement.  It's really hard to push air down to the underwater.  Yeah, that's very hard.  Yeah.  Air is difficult.  Yeah.  That's a great fucking story.  That is fantastic.  Two horrible boat stories.  And you stayed there.  You stayed there.  It's like an hour.  You fucking look at it, man.  To find out what it was for safety purposes for other people or to find out what it was.  I was concerned about somebody wrecking into it.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't want to be doing it. 
[03:13:30]  I wanted to go home, but...  You probably thought it was terrorism.  When you do the boat shit they give you to read, you're responsible for everybody out  there.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Were you running through a fantasy in your head of Louis C.K.?  Fucking terrorist.  Terrorist thwarted by comic Louis C.K.?  You know what's great?  All Anthony said was Louis C.K.  And we all burst out of the woods.  We all knew the text.  He's just dangerous.  Like, yeah.  Yes, everybody's going to know now that I'm really a captain. 
[03:14:00]  Homeland Security.  But instead, the headline reads, in quotes, comic arrested for pranking police department.  Yeah.  Comic.  Local.  Local comic.  Yeah, you thought that there was going to be like, good, cool, you saw something and  you said something.  Good job.  That's a local comic known for playing grandpa's city club in Yonkers.  Comes across a piece of hardware that's been there since the World's Fair.  Yes.  He's calling the police for being attacked by a giant bowling ball. 
[03:14:30]  It's a big circle and it's just hanging out there for 51 years.  That's fun.  Finally, somebody caught it.  God, that's fucking great, man.  I want to look at the time.  Yeah.  It is getting late.  I have shit.  I go to the gym before therapy.  I would love to not have to go home.  What are you doing today?  I don't probably cardio because I have therapy.  What's today?  Wednesday.  Oh, Wednesday.  How'd you do neck?  It's fucking arms.  Upper body today.  I'd just do neck.  Upper body.  On Wednesday? 
[03:15:00]  Pull-ups.  Hump day, Anthony.  I gotta do neck.  Only.  When's kettlebell day?  Set up one.  Push-ups where you fucking, you go down.  There's no cheating on these push-ups.  You go down, lift your hands up off the fucking floor.  And then you gotta go again, hands up off the floor.  What are you talking about?  You can't fucking push-ups.  That's cheating.  That is cheating.  No.  Sure it is.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  You take a nap in between.  Your chest is on the floor.  And your arms go up, so you can't just do these, you're only moving like two inches.  How about you just make sure you're an inch off the floor?  No.  How about you fucking...  You engage your core more with what Anthony is saying.  Exactly. 
[03:15:30]  Because your hands are all the way up.  Very difficult.  I'm gonna have to try that one.  I'm just doing neck.  Very difficult.  Just neck today, huh, Colin?  Just neck.  Sets of one or two.  It was a big wait day for me.  I had too many carbs last night.  That's unbelievable.  I know.  I spoke at a friend of mine's house.  He said, Colin, why don't you come over?  I said, oh, I've thought that good of a story, you know?  What do you want me to do?  What do I have?  Some great orator, all of a sudden.  Like, oh, here comes Colin with a filibuster about his friend's house.  Jesus.  Jesus. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  You got two Emmys.  I'm doing neck.  It's not even just the voice.  No, it's totally him.  It's what's being said.  The cadence.  Yes.  No, everything.  The fucking face.  And the appropriate defeated term.  Jesus.  That's fucking fantastic, Jay.  You threw Colin off today.  We called it.  Oh, yeah.  A couple of times during this time, he's done it and I've jerked my head over.  Like, I swear, like, I forgot.  My favorite is Eddie Vedder, but.  No Vedder today. 
[03:16:30]  That's all right.  You did a lot last time.  We're all very proud of Louis C.K.  He's been a friend of us for a very long time.  Louis is one of the greats.  A good guy, you know.  This is dissident.  I like to say nothing before every song.  And it really just evaporates the time that you have.  And you spent Dick Cheney's, the world's biggest asshole.  He said that when I saw him.  Really?  And I was like, you didn't play Jeremy yet.  You're the world's biggest asshole. 
[03:17:00]  What are we, girlfriends now?  Get Jeremy over with and then you can talk about Dick Cheney.  Fucking, when you do your set.  Right.  And then when the house lights come on at 11, come back out.  We'll have a little polit talk.  Fucking little Eddie Vedder.  You jerk.  Eddie, what do you think of the election last night?  I think it was a victory for all Americans.  And African-American, Polish-American, American-American.  But if we don't see color in this band, the only color we see is black.  This is black.  That is such a fucking great Eddie Vedder, man.  Fucking long.  It's really good. 
[03:17:30]  You got to make sure you vote.  If you vote, then you can complain all you want.  Is he pretending to be Scottish or something, that guy?  He's a little better.  On Twitter last night, people said, do you realize you're doing Johnny Depp?  So now I'm going to go watch a whole bunch of fucking Johnny Depp movies and work on  iron pressure that no one will laugh at into my act.  If I do Harvey Keitel for eight minutes just to make Joe DeRosa laugh, the audience is  staring at me like I'm a jerk.  You say the goddamn words.  DeRosa's going to be okay.  But can you imagine Eddie Vedder talking to Jack Nicholson? 
[03:18:00]  Well.  We have a real celebrity in the house.  Normally, we don't turn the house lights on people because we want you to have your anonymity  and be a group part of the group, but my God, four easy pieces.  Jack Nicholson is here tonight joining us.  Hey, Pearl Jam.  Hey, here's Johnny.  I say we don't know Johnny, but we know Jeremy.  Observation, Louis C.K. is officially a big deal because a guy you rarely see is waiting 
[03:18:30]  to say hi to you.  Scott Greenstein.  Look at that.  He only comes around for the big guys.  Oh, yeah.  He'll give you some kind of line of bullshit.  Oh, he's listening.  Fuck you.  I don't care.  Spoken like a man who's husband.  I got a contract.  I don't give a fuck.  Colin Vedder just crashed in my face.  Wow.  Spoken like a man that has a contract.  Have him come in and say hi.  Spoken like a man.  There's something that you do with your face when you make it.  Colin, you get your... 
[03:19:00]  Colin's the same face as...  This is the same face as Keitel.  What the fuck was Louis thinking?  Colin's got that smelling...  Colin's got that smelling...  He didn't take anyone.  And then Colin is just a little more.  Colin's got that smelling...  And Vedder is just drunk on red wine because if it takes all night, well then that's all  right.  I enjoy Elevator Eyes with Opie.  Make sure you see his YouTube channel.  I have a question about the Emmys.  Oh.  Yeah.  Did you win the first one you were nominated for? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  I mean, the first one that came up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were the first.  I mean, that category was like second on the whole night.  Jeez.  And when you lose it, are you thinking like, fuck, or is it like, no, I already got one?  No.  It's like, it should be.  Like what I would say, the answer I would say, because I want to sound like, you know,  I'm a really down-to-earth dude.  Yeah.  You know, I won that one, then I was like, totally, then I was like set for the night.  But you're, you're, I'm greedy.  Like everybody else.  So I actually didn't, I wish I had won that one last, because I would have been like, fuck, 
[03:20:00]  fuck, fuck.  Yes, I got one.  Yeah.  But I won one, I'm like, all right, okay, but how many more?  I could get more.  Yeah.  So I didn't enjoy, I didn't properly enjoy the two that I won, because there was still  more coming up.  Like, okay, how many am I getting?  And then when I'm done, when I lost the last one, I was like, all right, well, two is good.  That's two.  No, I'll totally cop to that.  Where are the Emmys right now?  He's brought out the worst in me.  Where are they?  The whole thing.  Where'd you put them?  I got them on my, one on my desk and one on the thing.  Use the boat. 
[03:20:30]  Use it to tie a rope and throw to food.  Use it to the mooring ball.  To the tree somewhere in Jersey.  Get a whole chicken and stick it on one of those wings.  We're starving over here, you three.  I would have happily done that with the weight of them.  You were nominated for more than anybody else ever, though, right?  Seven?  Seven, yeah.  Wow.  Wow, that's ever?  Yeah.  That's the most ever.  But David Lynch was on my show.  He was the prior record with five.  That David Lynch shit was amazing.  I didn't realize it was him at first. 
[03:21:00]  Fucking amazing.  Like, I'm watching it.  He's like the best actor I ever had on the show.  He was that fucking, and it's kind of, being involved with some of those people.  Being involved with those people on some level, that was, he played the perfect network guy.  No, it was unbelievable.  It was perfect.  He didn't want to do it either.  It took me like 10.  I mean, I wrote him many emails.  Really?  And he was writing back, I love the scripts, but you really ought to get somebody else.  Go.  I'm not an actor.  Oh, is he good.  Go. 
[03:21:30]  He pulled it off.  Gary Marshall was amazing, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That one monologue he gave was chilling.  Unbelievable.  And he's an old, old, he's an old man.  He's been in here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's great.  He fucking kicked ass.  It was chilling.  Did he do that just as you had written it, or did he improv that at all?  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  So he said it as an actor, did it?  Yeah.  He said every word exactly.  I love the Dane episode from way back.  Yeah, that was good.  Dane did great.  Yeah, he did.  Dane did a really good job.  And you, I've been defending Dane forever, so I was happy to just, you had him on.  Dane's a good guy.  He's a very nice guy.  Oh, a black wife. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, we haven't talked to you about this season.  Yeah, yeah.  Also, you just throw a black wife in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With white kids.  She's a good actress.  That's it.  You know what?  The one scene in the late show three-part run, there's a scene where she says, you have  to get this job.  Yeah.  She did that better than anybody.  That's really what got her the job.  Wow.  And you didn't feel like you had to explain anything?  I didn't know, because if I had known how good she was going to be, I might have started  with black kids.  But it happened in the order it happened. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  I'd already picked the kids, and she was just the best one, so I decided, some people  will go, what is that?  But I don't care if they say it.  I love that you didn't explain it.  Who cares?  Yeah, it would have been to try to explain it, because there was no explanation.  Just let it be.  It just is what it is.  And the other thing was the motorcycle.  Yeah.  Did you ride motorcycles before that episode?  Yeah, I used to ride one regularly.  A little bit?  Back in the day, I know you had one.  Yeah, I had one.  And you used to ride on your walls in your apartment.  That's right.  And you know, Jay and I, we were like in village clubs together for a long time. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, really?  Back in the day, yeah.  And then Louis shot past me on a rocket ship.  Well, you shot past first.  I was hot shit for a while.  You shot past first.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jay showed up.  When I gave an ex-wife every penny I ever earned.  This fucking skinny kid from...  Now I'm a fucking ham and egger.  This kid from New Jersey shows up, this skinny kid, and he just gets every fucking possible  gig.  And actually, I learned a lesson from Jay's coming up, because I remember thinking, I mean,  I had been doing it for a while, and he shot right past me.  He was younger than me.  He hadn't been doing it as long. 
[03:23:30]  But I thought, he's not taking my gigs.  He's getting his.  And I was happy for him.  I always...  He was the first person I...  Like, he's the guy on which I processed that idea.  Yeah.  That it's got nothing to do with me.  That's his success.  And also, Jay had so many fucking tools.  He's got this rubber voice, and he had this funny arrogance.  Like, he had a...  He was a hockey kid, and it was funny.  I'm happy to hear you guys discussing this, too, as opposed to me in the mirror every morning,  who I just repeat, slow and steady wins the race. 
[03:24:00]  That funny arrogance I've learned in subsequent podcasts bred a lot of hate.  It's okay, man.  It is now.  You leave a trail of a bunch.  Yeah, it is now, and that's all it has to be.  I mean, I think when you identify that it's not really a proper way to behave to strangers,  like, look at these fucking assholes sitting at a table, and it's like, we don't really  know who you are, and now we just think you're a dick.  Oh, shit.  Because you're used to hanging out with, like, you know, Jimmy and Louie and Patrice at the 
[03:24:30]  cellar.  Because you're friends, yeah.  Then you go someplace else to L.A. with fucking L.A. comics, and you're like, look at these  fucking assholes.  And also, when you're doing assholes, it doesn't work out the same way, huh?  When you did the acting, like Jerry Maguire, everybody respected that.  That was a fucking...  Trademark role.  It was great.  I wish I did it now.  It's a great part.  It would be a way bigger deal, because everybody would know who I was.  That's a good idea.  Is that any better?  Got that job?  This is awkward, Jerry.  You should say something.  It's real.  Great line.  You want it smaller. 
[03:25:00]  You want it smaller.  I get it.  Crowded.  What?  I can only do Tom Cruise's laugh smile.  So I was pointing at Louie as Tom Cruise.  I get it.  Crowded restaurant.  That's really good.  So there's no scene.  You unctuous.  You wanted smaller.  I still don't know all those words.  My wife goes, how come you remember everything you've ever...  I don't remember.  I go, because everything I've ever done only lasted a year.  If anything was ever successful, it would be a fucking blur. 
[03:25:30]  Saturday Night Live, two years.  Gary Unmarried, two years.  Jeff Boxworthy's show, five episodes.  Like, everything I've ever done, or a movie's like, three weeks.  Action.  Action, eight episodes.  So it's not like, you know, if Gary Unmarried went like five years, it's like, oh, just garbage  in, garbage out.  I don't know what the fuck I said.  Like, she was on three shows that went five years each time.  Jesus.  Of course you don't remember anything.  Like, Louie doesn't know dialogue from season one, do you?  Of what?  My show?  We're out of time.  Listen.  All right.  All right.  We should wrap up. 
[03:26:00]  I'm killing him.  I'm sorry.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, right?  Out there on Long Island?  Yeah.  There's no power.  Come on out to the governors, and we'll keep you warm with laughter.  Jesus.  Louie, you promoting anything?  What do you got, buddy?  Well, I'm going to do that.  I think the Saturday before Thanksgiving will be at the Staten Island thing.  Good.  And so it'll be on my website.  Okay.  And there will be a place on the website to give money to people in Staten Island.  Oh, that's pretty fucking nice.  I think what we're going to do is have the tickets be like 90 bucks, and then you're 
[03:26:30]  getting a ticket, and then you're buying one for somebody there.  So we'll raise money, and people get to see the show, whose houses are...  Maybe it's...  What about the people that just were not affected on Staten Island at all?  How are you going to...  We have a way to tell them to go fuck with something.  We'll see.  And Jimmy?  I will be in Buffalo New Year's Eve, December 28th through the 31st.  I'm at the Helium Comedy Club in Buffalo, and this Thursday through Saturday, November 
[03:27:00]  15th through 17th, I'm at the Addison Improv.  Good club.  It's great.  Yeah, I love Dallas.  That's a great club.  I love that room.  I'm going to love Buffalo.  Yes.  New Year's Eve.  Kenny's fired up about it.  Is he?  Thank you.  Why did I fucking...  Why?  What do you mean why?  For money.  For the balloons.  Yeah, but I know why.  I mean...  I mean, it's in Buffalo.  Tell me why.  No, but I mean the weather is going to be hard.  Tell me why, Jake.  Why?  Why are we going to come all the way to Cleveland for you to get beat by a fucking movie?  Why? 
[03:27:30]  You want everyone to invite them?  Yeah.  It's going to be cold.  Let's get out of here, I guess.  Yeah.  What?  All right.  You got a big shot that wants to say hi to you, though.  Great.  Louis, thanks so much.  Do I have to do that?  Oh, man.  It's just nonsense.  You can do whatever you like.  Make believe you don't speak English.  I've got to go uptown.  Listen, make believe you don't speak English.  He's kind of...  This might be hard to convince him.  Yeah, it's just nonsense.  He doesn't...  He's a radio guy.  Well, that's true.  I am.  Probably should do a radio shot.  This is Bugs.  Bugs.  All right, Jay Morris.  Later.  Lucy K. 
[03:28:00]  Great seeing you, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next!  SiriusXM On Demand.  SiriusXM On Demand.  Hey, hey, hey! 
[03:28:30]  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O.N.A. Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah!  We're back with After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Danny and Travis.  O.P. and Jay Moore.  There's a lot going on today.  Louie is officially, like, on a different level.  You should have seen...  I mean, it used to be just... 
[03:29:00]  He would be in here every day.  And now, like, he can't come in here without, you know,  the outside of the studio and the lobby of the building and all.  Like, he has...  Roland has to walk in places because people harass him.  Yeah, but you know what?  What?  I have the same amount of boats as him.  At the moment.  Yeah, right now.  But he might be able to find his.  Captain Louie's...  He probably has a better chance of getting one than I do.  Who knew?  But who has more places to live at the moment?  I said when you, uh...  Oh, Louie wins.  Yeah, I don't have any place.  Well, you have an apartment. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, it's there.  Right.  Yeah.  See, Louie can just go to his apartment.  Hopefully not looted, but it's there.  It's there.  Like, your apartment exists.  Yeah.  You can't get back there still?  I can.  I mean, if I have a car.  I thought you had a car, though.  Yeah, my family went up to Montreal.  They left you?  Yeah.  I mean, it's better up there.  I would have left them, too.  Like, when they left,  Ant still didn't have heat.  We were staying at Anthony's house.  Yeah, but you could be like,  at least leave me the car.  Why don't you take a train?  Do they have trains?  Did Montreal not have railroad yet?  Yeah, but that's expensive.  What am I, making money?  You're making Sam Roberts money?  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  How much does a train cost?  A train up there?  That costs a lot of money.  Trains aren't cheap.  I had no idea.  I mean, a bus ride itself to Montreal  is like a buck twenty-five or something.  All right, so send her on a bus.  Send her and the kid.  That's what I used to do.  The kid probably is at least half fair,  if not less money,  because your kid is small.  I've seen it.  Yeah, but she still takes up a seat.  What's going on in L.A., Opie?  I don't even know.  Did you hear them talking about that?  I didn't hear them talking about it, 
[03:30:30]  but I know what's going on.  They're going to do television in Los Angeles  in Hollywood, California.  I heard.  I did not miss a day.  Fly Friday, come back Sunday.  Company man.  Company man.  Good for you, Opie.  Don't miss a day.  Did you hear me trashing him?  No, I don't think so,  because I was...  He didn't look like he heard it.  No, he knew you were talking about him.  But he didn't hear.  No, you can't hear anything.  I was signaling Roland to...  I thought you guys had an eye on him.  No, no, no.  I was signaling Roland to tell him to come in here.  He said no to that.  I was hoping he heard it.  He politely declined the offer to come in. 
[03:31:00]  Could you get a disc of what I said  and put it on his desk?  Could I do that?  No, I couldn't.  Why?  Just slide it under his door.  Because I still have something to lose here.  You know what I mean?  I don't have a contract and fuck you money.  In fact, I don't have either of those two things.  Right, so it leaves me in a precarious...  It is.  It's nice, isn't it?  All right, y'alls.  I can't believe the XFL's coming back.  I don't have...  I also don't have TV deals on the table.  It's gonna be a bust.  You're going to Hollywood to film a TV show.  Yeah, so I'll get warm for two days.  Who cares? 
[03:31:30]  I do.  I'll do it if you don't want to do it.  Come on out.  On your dime.  I don't have a dime.  That's the problem.  My dime doesn't cover plane tickets.  It's literally a dime.  It's 10 cents.  I'm gonna film Jay doing any better.  I thought you already did that.  It's a big hit.  He wants more.  I thought it was called Opie Radio, not Jay Moore Radio.  Someone commented on Opie's video.  I think it's the top comment, so everybody could see it.  They should be called Eddie Elevator.  God.  Which I think is hysterical.  There's a video on Opie Radio on YouTube. 
[03:32:00]  It's Jay Moore doing Eddie Vedder in an elevator.  It's my favorite impression.  Elevator.  Elevator.  Of course it's your favorite impression.  You're an Eddie Vedder, Mark.  Yeah, but it's so good.  Like, it's so right.  It is good.  And I gotta tell you, what day was he in?  Monday?  Yeah.  I loved Eddie Vedder on Monday.  Today, and I don't know, I know in this room it was only me that was laughing.  I don't know how it was taken by the radio audience, but disruptive Colin Quinn, before  Louie got here, when Jay was just doing Colin completely disrupting the conversation on all 
[03:32:30]  turns, that was my favorite thing ever.  When he said, and then he got into it again when Louie was telling his boat story, and  they were talking about the area of the water called Hell's Gate, and Colin Quinn said it  should be Watergate.  That really tickled me.  I don't know if my laugh was audible from the couch behind everybody, but...  What do you think Eric's doing?  Where's Eric?  Eating and shitting.  Why does nobody take this show seriously?  It's like...  Which show's over at 10 o'clock. 
[03:33:00]  Apparently.  Apparently, after Open Anthony Live doesn't rate for most of the people around here.  Sal, what is Eric doing?  He said he had to go talk to Jay Moore about a podcast, even though Jay Moore's not running  this weekend, so I don't know.  Oh, God.  Eric's always trying to network.  He's always wheeling and dealing.  I wonder...  Oh, there he is.  He's running back.  Eric has his fingers in so many pies, and also everything that's happening around SiriusXM.  I see what you did there.  He just loves licking that blueberry filling.  Fuck that pie.  Eric, what were you talking to Jay Moore about? 
[03:33:30]  About doing an exclusive more stories here at SiriusXM.  Why?  Is this for the E-Rock Podcast Network?  No.  No.  How is the E-Rock Nagel podcast thing going?  You said a while back that you were going to launch a podcast, correct?  Yeah, it's taking a back seat for a while.  Why is that?  I just got too many other things to deal with.  He's got too much on his plate, but you didn't want to say that.  What do you mean you got too many things to deal with?  All you got to do is...  I know what he's dealing with.  What?  He's probably dealing with the same thing I'm dealing with.  Well, all you got to do is turn on the mic and talk about what you're dealing with.  That's the podcast. 
[03:34:00]  I don't have it set up yet, so I'm just going to wait.  Nagelcast.  Eric.  It's a microphone and a computer.  That's all you do.  It takes no time to set it up.  Just steal a recorder from here, plug a mic into it, and all of a sudden, you've got  a podcast set up.  Or you could just sit here for an hour and talk into a microphone and bring it home and  upload it somewhere.  Are you ever going to do it?  Or did I give you that domain name for no reason?  No, I'm going to do it.  You are?  Yeah.  I got to get that set up too.  I got to get that site set up. 
[03:34:30]  Well, you just got to, I mean, you got to just start, you know, doing the podcast.  Like, don't worry about setting everything up.  Just do it.  But I need somewhere to host it too, right?  You just need to get onto a mic and do it.  Like, and then figure everything out.  You can't just upload a podcast to iTunes or something like that?  No, you have to have server space.  But there are services that do it.  But the thing about it is, it's the same thing as anything.  Like, when you're, when the idea, it's like, for stand-ups, like Jim's always said,  you don't, like.  You don't start on a stage.  You got to write material.  Well, you know, you don't, you don't figure out what your outfit's going to be and figure 
[03:35:00]  out when the best time to do it is.  And you just go up and start doing it.  And then you learn.  And then it takes you about a year before you've actually got anything presentable.  I'm going to do a podcast.  And then you go forward.  Yeah.  It would, you could do one today though.  Yeah.  It'll be about dogs.  Right.  And then it would, I mean, it would probably take you a lot less than a year to figure out  there is no audience for it.  But, but that's still something you would learn through the process, you know?  Like Eric.  Yeah.  You do just have to just do it.  You got to just do it.  Cause you know what you're doing?  You're creating excuses. 
[03:35:30]  So, well, I don't know.  And I'm not saying that Eric doesn't have a legit excuse.  No, but when did you start talking about this podcast?  A while ago.  That's a good point.  Maybe like the last five months he hasn't had good excuses, but right now he does.  And that's convenient.  And all this shit that he's dealing with right now.  That's what you talk about.  Yeah.  Like now you actually have life experience that you're dealing with as it's happening.  Or, you know what you should do?  You should just do the Iraq Nagel show on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[03:36:00]  You've got a channel.  I mean, we would, Opie would give you the time.  We'd all flip out if you said you were going to do a show on this channel.  Why not come on and do the Iraq Nagel show?  Is that what it's called?  I thought so.  That's the working title.  Why don't you do it on the channel?  You don't have to set anything up.  There's no personal investment.  We have, this is what we were talking about when Opie came in during hurricane week during  the afternoon and just did the random, you know, surprise show that there's no reason 
[03:36:30]  to podcast.  We have a channel.  Yeah.  Why not just do a show?  They'll let you do a show.  Especially if it's a one-off, just like a special.  Yeah, maybe.  I'll think about it.  No joke.  You know who should do a show?  Roland should do a, should do a food review show.  Yeah.  I mean.  But he's not very descriptive.  Yeah.  Well, you'd have to have a, like a.  He, Roland could, Roland could review all of New York City's food in one hour.  You know what the name, you know what the name of the show would be?  Delicious. 
[03:37:00]  It's delicious.  Best blank ever.  Right.  Because everything he eats is the best blank ever.  Eric, I want to go to restaurants that Roland doesn't like, or like, where, like, oh, I  went there, he was terrible.  Or Dunkin' Donuts.  Wait, he hates Dunkin' Donuts.  He goes in all the time, I saw him with Dunkin' Donuts yesterday.  No, he hates Dunkin' Donuts donuts.  Yeah, he does.  He likes gourmet shit.  We went to, uh, when we were in Cleveland, we were at the mall to get lunch.  And, and Roland, like, first of all.  Is that when Eric got all upset at the stuff that he was passing by after he had eaten?  Yeah, he got really pissed, because we started passing by restaurants after we'd eaten in 
[03:37:30]  the food court.  But, and I think it was either Eric or Roland that thought of the food court as a buffet.  Like, as in...  That was Roland.  Okay, it was Roland.  He went...  Yeah, you know why?  Because Roland was still on his diet, and Cleveland was like cheat weekend for him.  It was cheat weekend.  Now it's just cheat lifetime.  Now he's done.  He finished his diet.  But Roland...  And he was doing so well.  Roland treated food court like a buffet in the sense that he went to each kiosk in  the food court and got a dish.  That's what the show should be called. 
[03:38:00]  Food court, where Roland judges whether something's good or not.  But...  I'm a genius.  Yeah, but we've...  After eating bad mall food court food, Roland passed by Dunkin' Donuts, and we're like,  oh, we're gonna go get some donuts.  And Roland goes, no, I'm not gonna eat Dunkin' Donuts.  He hates Dunkin' Donuts.  It's dry, it's stale, I'm not gonna eat Dunkin' Donuts.  You like food court, huh?  Food court would be a good show, but you'd need a translator.  Yeah, and almost like a ghost writer, because he's not gonna say everything.  Like, someone needs to go with him, and then when Roland goes, hey, you see, you see, and 
[03:38:30]  then someone would go, what he meant to say, was that it was cooked properly, the service  was fantastic, the decor.  Roland is a great talent booker.  Just, I mean, whether or not he was responsible for all of them, let's keep in mind, we've been  on this show, we've, three days this week, and we've featured Jay Moore, Louis C.K.,  and Ricky Gervais.  He's great at being the talent booker for the O.B.  and Anthony show.  He's terrible at communications.  If he'd gone to school for communications, he would not be out of it.  But he would have, unless he flunked out of it. 
[03:39:00]  He was in here, you remember when we did spin the wheel, make the deal, and everybody got  a chance to host the after show?  Roland hosted.  Right.  He had the five original MTV VJs in here to interview them.  He loves MTV.  Like, all he could do, listen, how about this?  They were around in the 80s.  Talk to them about Bruce.  Talk to them about Springsteen.  Whatever you want to do.  It's the easiest interview in the world, and there's five of them.  So you ask three questions, and you've got 15 minutes, because they're all just yapping. 
[03:39:30]  And Martha Quinn, you know she's got a mouth on her.  She likes to talk.  Right, and you ask her about those proactive commercials, or whatever she did after the  MTV thing.  I remember watching Martha Quinn when she was doing the acne commercials when I was younger.  But I was a generation after the first MTV VJs.  Yeah.  So she came on TV in the 90s, and she was like, I'm Martha Quinn, and I have acne.  And I'd be like, who the fuck is Martha Quinn?  Who gives a shit about your acne?  Yeah, some lady has acne.  I don't care.  I mean, you know, I barely even knew the new kids. 
[03:40:00]  It wasn't like when Jessica Simpson and Puff Daddy did the proactive commercials.  Then you could relate.  That's right.  Or Katy Perry.  She was like, look, I get acne.  And I was like, yeah, but everybody's looking at your tits all the time.  So what difference does it possibly make?  Maybe she's got chest acne.  But, yeah, maybe that's the problem.  And that would really end up in her career.  Yes, exactly.  You don't want to pop a zit on her boob?  What's that?  You don't want to pop a zit on her boob?  I don't think titty pimples are too attractive.  It's like a fifth grade.  Do you want to pop a zit on her boob? 
[03:40:30]  Don't you remember what 13?  Don't forget.  Don't forget.  We're all 13 here.  It's awful.  But, yeah, Roland had the five original MTV VJs in here.  And his one question, because I left the room.  Yeah.  His one question was, talk amongst yourselves.  And then he said, I don't want to be here.  And Mark Goodman goes, you don't?  He goes, no.  And then who's the other MTV VJ?  Not Mark Goodman.  The black guy?  No, the white guy who's almost like red hair. 
[03:41:00]  Eric?  You know who I'm talking about.  I can't remember his name.  Hold on.  Ricky Rackman?  No, not Mr. Hunter.  Alan Hunter was in here.  And he had his video camera out.  He was carrying his camcorder around.  He was like, look, man.  It's 2011 because it was last year, I think.  But we're back.  We're doing...  10, rather.  Really.  We're back.  We're doing press.  You know?  And he comes in, and it's this mumbling fat guy who refuses to talk to them.  And they all thought they were doing the Opie and Anthony, the grand, you know, highlight 
[03:41:30]  crown jewel of Sirius XM, the Opie and Anthony show.  But then it's really just Roland.  It's just Roland.  Telling you to talk amongst yourselves.  And when they were...  All the on-air lights there.  When they were coming, because I'd been sitting in the room with Roland the whole time,  helping him through phone calls and stuff.  When they all started coming in, there was all this commotion because it was five people  and it was the people that worked with them and everybody coming in.  And as they were all coming in and shaking hands, I just walked around and left the room.  And so everybody sits down and Roland looks up and he realizes it's only him in here. 
[03:42:00]  That's something that I don't understand about Roland is that he can talk.  I've seen him talk to the biggest A-listers for five minutes waiting to bring them in  and have great conversations with them.  And then you bring him behind that board and put five washed-up VJs in front of him  and he can't do anything.  Ironically, they're now V-listers.  They're nobodies.  And it's not even like he doesn't have anything to say.  Roland will be in the office just yapping to the point where you're like, 
[03:42:30]  shut the fuck up already.  Just bullshitting and bullshitting and bullshitting.  But when he's in front of a mic, it's a lot more difficult.  It's the whole mic thing.  Let's go to Jeff in Colorado.  Jeff, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Jeff in Colorado.  My new favorite state.  The E-Rock and Roland show.  Yeah, can I tell you?  Danny tried that Colorado line during the commercial break while Opie and Anthony were in here. 
[03:43:00]  But Danny got put for something.  Every now and then, and it happens, especially during the commercial breaks,  Opie and Anthony decide they're in their own worlds.  And they just don't acknowledge anything.  Yeah, and Danny went on to pay no mind list when he was trying to belt out some jokes.  Danny's trying really hard to talk about the pot situation in Colorado.  Yeah, and they were like, who's here?  What?  That's the only thing that matters.  Yeah.  Nothing else matters.  What are you, Metallica?  Jeff.  Yes, I am.  What's up, Jeff?  We need to see an E-Rock and Roland show, especially after E-Rock snaps, shoots everybody, but Roland. 
[03:43:30]  They both always have so much to say on the radio.  I can't wait to hear both of them.  Eric, why don't you do, I mean, the people, and you can call up and try to convince Eric to do a show on the channel,  because the people want to hear it.  You know what I mean?  Like, I'm not just speaking for myself.  I want to hear it.  Travis, do you want to hear an E-Rock show?  Absolutely.  Do you want to co-host Food Court?  Obviously, Danny is the producer behind Food Court.  He's taking the reins on this one. 
[03:44:00]  He knows success when he hears it.  You know who Eric's like on air?  Who?  He's like Bob Euker's sidekick in Major League.  Just a fly ball.  Yeah, exactly.  And Bob Euker's just carrying the whole thing on his back.  Sal, you'd want to see an E-Rock show or hear an E-Rock show.  Absolutely.  The kid's got a lot to say.  He's got opinions.  Obviously, E-Rock is looking for a creative outlet, because he does a lot.  E-Rock talks a lot.  He talks about doing a podcast a lot, but he never actually. 
[03:44:30]  Eric has been obsessed with the podcast.  I really am looking forward to hearing it.  Well, he's been talking about it since February.  That's what I'm saying.  It's November.  He's probably doing all his pre-production stuff, and it's going to be fucking killer once  it happens.  The stuff that Eric's telling me about that he has in mind, it should be really good.  What does he have in mind?  I don't know.  Sal's doing a bit.  Is he doing a bit?  I don't have production or anything made.  Is Sal doing a Sam Roberts where he's overselling, and then we make fun of Eric later?  I don't want to blow up his spot, but he says he's got a 360 ready.  He says he's got a whole Skype thing set up. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Eric, you're going to play it.  It's not set up yet.  You're going to play in a 360 and a Skype?  No.  I'm doing Skype, but I'm not doing full production or anything for the show.  You know what Eric's podcast can be about?  What?  What he wants his podcast to be.  Yeah.  Well, that's what the show could be about.  Here's what I want this to be one day.  Yeah.  I can't imagine why you would like...  Like, this isn't how you set it.  That's not a podcast.  I mean, you've spent too long in radio.  Like, a podcast is simply... 
[03:45:30]  Bare bones.  Bare bones, just a mic and whatever, and you're just kind of there.  Like, people...  It's not appointment listening.  People want to hear specifically what you have to say, so that's why they have to go and  download it.  You know what I mean?  So you don't have to sit there and be like, I'm worried about my cube.  Yeah, but you know him.  He's a consumer, and he wants, you know, a 360 and the Skype machine.  He's sitting there looking at, like, Adam Carolla's setup and, like, Joe Rogan's setup, and he's  like, that's what I need.  Before Adam Carolla or Joe Rogan had a setup, they got listeners, and then they got the setup. 
[03:46:00]  You know what I mean?  People do podcasts just talking into their MacBook, like, that bare bones.  Their iPhone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So why not, Eric?  How about this weekend?  No.  Yes.  Why are you...  You're not busy.  You're not busy.  Yes, I am busy.  What are you doing?  You have time to build Lego toys and play WWE 13.  I haven't done that in a while.  When's the last Lego toy you built?  That would be the Millennium Falcon. 
[03:46:30]  He's so proud.  You hear that little pride at the end of that?  Let's see.  I have others waiting.  I just haven't opened them yet.  As a matter of fact, that would be the Millennium Falcon.  Can you just take line one so we can just...  This guy just won't stop calling.  Okay.  Don't pick him up.  I gotta do not take this line.  Yeah.  The 208 number.  Don't take him.  He's just a fucking asshole.  Adam, but that's why.  Yeah, yeah.  You just gotta shoot him down.  He just hung up.  If he calls back, I'm gonna take him.  Why don't you want him to be on the air, so?  No.  Anthony was talking.  He calls for like two hours. 
[03:47:00]  Hey, guy on Area Code 208, you're on the air.  Hello.  The radio.  What's your name?  My name is Jeff Bun Bun.  All right.  I didn't hear your last name, but I don't care what it is.  I've heard that you've been calling the show for like two hours.  It's been two and a half.  I can't see why I wouldn't get on the air.  It's been about two and a half hours.  I've been told by many people, do not take this call. 
[03:47:30]  Now, what is it that you have for the show that you're calling for?  I really have for the show.  I just had to...  Okay.  Why, when somebody tells you that we're not taking your call, can you not just accept that  we know what we're doing?  No.  Right.  I don't know what's wrong, but I love it.  You know that scene in Wayne's World when they're ordering the donuts?  All right.  So now that you've made it on the air, what's your name again? 
[03:48:00]  Jeff.  It doesn't matter.  Jeff Bun Bun.  Now that you're on the air, are you satisfied?  No.  What is it that you want?  Nothing.  All right.  Well, then please stop calling this phone number.  I'm going to hang up.  208-746.  Oh.  746.  You're right.  Larry in West Virginia?  7-D.  Yes, Sam.  Sam, I... 
[03:48:30]  Sam, I am going to try to keep my emotions under check.  Because you were so cruel a week ago, Monday.  You were so cruel.  No, I had it.  You said there was going to be 24 hours of Sam Roberts.  You said there was going to be 24 hours of Sam Roberts.  My spirit showed, Sam.  Yeah.  I was so happy.  I was elated.  My spirit showed.  And then you hand off the holding.  Fez, you realize what that does to people.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, Ron...  You are so cruel, you are you cruel bastard. 
[03:49:00]  You cruel bastard.  I apologize to you, Larry.  Ron and Fez do a good show.  I just thought that everybody would want some variety.  You promised 24 hours of Sam.  All right, I'm going to work on that then.  Larry, do you write notes?  Or is this all off the top of your head every day?  You think he's like Patton Oswalt?  I don't call every day.  He's got a card.  I don't call every day.  Yeah.  I do not call.  After Sam hangs up on him, he wings it through a fucking fake window like Letterman.  Larry, I'm going to work on the 24-hour marathon just for you. 
[03:49:30]  No, but that's...  No, Sam.  Yeah.  You already promised.  You have no idea the deflation.  Well, I don't know what to do to make it better.  Jerk said G-E.  G-E, folks.  What can I do to make it better, Larry?  I think I'm done.  I really do think I'm done.  Well, don't be done.  Give me...  How about you enjoy...  He's right.  Fuck me for being so stupid for being a Sam Roberts fan.  What happens to the callers?  They call you up.  They love me.  But it's like a sickening, sociopathic... 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, but then you got Fred Bobo or whatever his name is.  I think it was Fred Bobo.  As a matter of fact...  Thank you, Larry.  We have to go back to Fred Bobo, who's calling back.  That's Fred's real name.  That was real name, actually.  Fred Bobo just hung up.  And what the fuck is wrong with the phones?  I don't know.  Nobody fixed...  Has anybody even attempted?  Mars told me there was an issue this morning, but I don't...  I think it's out of his control.  Whose control is it under?  The internet's control.  No.  The internet.  Let's go back to Fred Bobo.  Fred, you're on the air.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, how it's starting to feed us now. 
[03:50:30]  Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom.  Radio Shark.  Is it actually Radio Shark or no?  All right.  Are we good?  I'm entertained.  All right.  All right, buddy.  So when can we get the E-Rock show going?  I don't know.  Wendy, let's get... 
[03:51:00]  How about...  What's this I don't know stuff?  Come on.  We have the intro music, right?  The E-Rock Army.  We got you a song.  It's called E-Rock Army N-Word.  If Who Kid was here, I would say it more clearly.  He gave you the card.  I know, but I just don't want to abuse it.  All right.  You have the opportunity.  Obviously, there's a time slot that we could give you to try out because when we replayed  Opie's Tuesday show, we did the 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday night time slot. 
[03:51:30]  So why not put the Nagel Experience on one night only, 5 p.m. Eastern time, Saturday night.  I got the name of the show.  Afternoon Sex.  Afternoon Delight.  Afternoon Delight is the name of the show.  So, Eric, when does Afternoon Delight make its way to the opening?  I don't know.  I can't think about it.  What is there to think about?  I don't want to just jump into this, Ron.  You're not jumping into it.  You've been talking about it for 10 months.  It's been radio for 30 years. 
[03:52:00]  You're not jumping into it.  Yeah.  What's there to think about?  Danny's right.  You've been in radio for all of your life.  You started in radio when you were 9 years old.  A sperm.  His dad jerked off on a microphone.  That's how this whole thing began.  Your dad jerked off into a microphone.  That microphone developed an egg.  It swam into the fallopian tube.  His mother was artificially inseminated with a come down microphone.  Yes.  You are the Danny DeVito of that exchange.  But still, radio's in your blood.  Troy, you believe what we're hearing?  It's not going to happen.  Don't you want to hear it? 
[03:52:30]  Of course I want to hear it.  It's not going to happen.  It's a great show.  It's not going to happen.  Why?  Because, first of all, do you remember when you guys first came to the building,  he was like, oh, I'm going to start, I'm going to be a DJ on either Alt Nation or Hits One.  He said that?  Don't you remember that?  Don't you remember?  No, I was going to try for Faction.  And what happened?  They offered me something at night, but it was late Sunday night, and I was just like,  I'm not going to do it.  Is that better than nothing?  What?  I mean, you're on overnights on Hits.  I didn't give him a morning show, so he's like, yeah.  What did you expect?  It's pre-taped. 
[03:53:00]  Who cares what time it's on?  Well, at that point, I didn't know how they did everything around here.  Yes, he did.  He did.  Did the guy who's been in radio forever think that the overnight guy was here overnight?  You didn't ask, is it voice-tracked?  Or like, can I voice-track it?  You were just like, hey, I want to be a DJ on whatever, Punk'd Radio, whatever station you did.  Faction.  Punk'd Radio.  But it might as well be Punk'd Radio.  It's always Ashton Kutcher, Trucker Hat Kids, listen to that channel.  But they wear him sideways.  What?  You were just like, wow, they only gave me Sunday nights. 
[03:53:30]  It's not good enough for the sex man?  I need a daily shift?  I need to be Mr. Afternoons?  No.  I just, I was like, no, you don't want to screw it.  I'm not going to do music.  Why?  Because I changed my mind.  I didn't want to do it.  Okay.  I wanted to do a talk show.  I'll give you another reason why it's never going to happen.  Why?  Because what do you think the guys are going to do?  They're going to dissect every single second of that.  But you've got to put yourself up to risk.  I mean, I've been dissected and dissected.  Sam's been doing his Hits 1 show for years now. 
[03:54:00]  And I was just, do you know how badly I've been dismantled on this show because of Hits 1?  You can handle it.  That doesn't even happen anymore.  It happened like the first week or two.  Yeah, they got over it.  And I improved and then they weren't interested anymore.  The biggest shit that you took was giving out your Twitter too much.  Or like corny Twitter jokes or something.  But that's the audience that's listening to that shit anyway.  I said tweet me.  They didn't take your podcast and fucking dissect it?  No, because they were like, whatever.  He's doing his thing.  Yeah, but this is sex bag.  Everybody in this room knows that.  Everybody knows that they're going to fucking dissect every second of that podcast. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, but you know what?  You mean afternoon sex?  That's right.  Or is it sex on the afternoon?  I kind of like both.  No, it's afternoon delight.  Afternoon sex is better.  No, but it's so base.  Afternoon delight is right there.  Eric would come up with the name afternoon sex.  Well, because he's the sex bagel.  Listen, I know what he is, but if he did a show, they would dissect it the first week.  If he came back and did it the second week, they would smash him again.  If he came back and did it a third week, they'd be like, okay, it is what it is. 
[03:55:00]  And he could continue to do it.  Do you really think his morale could really handle something like that?  He's like, Sal, and he quits because Panda Angry didn't go over?  Yes.  Yes.  Come on.  Like, why is this all such an question?  Eric, is that the problem?  You don't want to get smashed?  No.  It's inevitable.  I know even if I do the podcast, it's going to get smashed.  I'm well aware of that.  But don't do a podcast.  Do a show right here on the channel. 
[03:55:30]  Your listeners are here already.  It's not like somebody...  Yeah, your audience is here.  Right.  It's not like somebody who doesn't listen to O&A is going to be like, oh, man, I hear about this E-Rock guy from New Jersey.  Got to download the new Bagel-in-with-the-Sex.  Right.  Nobody...  Like, people who don't know the Opie and Anthony show right now are not interested in Bagel-in-with-the-Sex.  Bagel-in-with-the-Sex is a show specifically catered to the Opie and Anthony audience.  What the hell is that about?  All the Bagel-in-with-the-Sex screwed up my tongue.  Bagel-in-with-the-Sex in the afternoon.  Right. 
[03:56:00]  Like, eventually, yeah, the goal is to extend your audience out there.  That's all of our goals.  But it takes time.  At first, you've got to use, you know, this audience that you've developed through the Opie and Anthony show.  And you've got a lot of audience members that love you.  You have an army.  A lot of them are screaming, E-Rock army, nigga, at the top of their lungs.  You know what I'm saying?  This is true.  You've heard people do that, right?  Yeah, and he has by far the...  In my opinion, the best jingle so far.  By far.  I would agree.  Yeah.  I mean, that means people love you.  And they sampled me on that, too, which I'm happy about. 
[03:56:30]  Yes, they did.  Well, that doesn't have anything to do with you, Troy.  It's about E-Rock.  I just had to bring it back around.  Well, I know, but it's about E-Rock.  And the point is this.  If Troy did a show, he couldn't go to the phones because, you know what?  He'd be like, okay, I just spent 15 minutes setting up a topic.  Line one, yeah, Troy, you suck.  Okay, line two, fuck you, Troy.  Okay, line three, yeah, you're a fucking douche.  Okay.  And he couldn't do that.  But you, if you got on the air, would get good phones going.  You could get your little topics going.  Somebody out there wants to talk about Legos. 
[03:57:00]  Wrestling?  Yeah, I'll be calling in.  We were trying to make fun of him for doing Legos, and people called in defending him.  They were like, no, fuck you, bro.  I built a Millennium Falcon, too.  I'm going to bagel with the sex.  Eric.  That's a wordy title.  We're bageling with the sex.  Yeah, but then at the end of the show, you could say, hey, you've been bageling with  the sex.  It's bageling with an N and an apostrophe.  Yeah.  I think we should just do everything for him.  Meaning, give him the name.  How about this?  Listen, give him the name.  Okay.  We'll do up all the production.  We'll make sure it's all, like, we all know it sounds tight, sounds good. 
[03:57:30]  Start working on it.  Come up with some ideas and just be like, Eric, here's everything.  Just go do the goddamn show.  Here's the goal.  One week from Saturday, a two-hour block.  He'll be busy.  5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern.  Hour one is bageling with the sex, and hour two is the food court with Roland.  I love it.  Let's start working on production.  Eric, we're doing a week from Saturday.  Clear your calendar.  What day is a week from Saturday?  Let me check.  This is easily the most productive creative meeting we've had. 
[03:58:00]  November, everybody.  It's not going to happen, though.  I'll tell you why.  Because it's going to have to go up the flagpole down there, and then it's going to have to  get taken over to this one.  No, it's bullshit, because I know that slot is free, because I slid the Opie show in that  slot with no problems with one day's notice.  You know what?  Let's just do something fun and just do it.  Yeah, that slot's opening.  We're opening that up live.  Fuck them.  They're not listening.  Fuck them.  They're not listening right now.  We can take this channel live whenever we want.  So if I went back there to management, and I was like, so we're going to do bageling  with the sex Saturday? 
[03:58:30]  They'd be like, what's bageling with the sex?  That's what they would do?  No, you go in Monday, and you go, did you hear bageling with the sex?  Yeah.  Well, it's fucking awesome.  But you're saying, Travis, that they don't know this pitch at all.  I'm telling you, if at 11 o'clock you went in there and you said, so what do you  think?  They'd say about what?  They'd be like, Louie was great.  Oh, okay.  Well, then that's a whole other hurdle, but we can jump that hurdle.  There's no way.  Eric, we're setting it up nice for you.  We'll carry Eric over it.  We're all going to have to do it together. 
[03:59:00]  We're all going to have to live.  Not one of us is going to be able to do it, but all of us together can live.  It'll be like a funeral.  It'll be like Paul Bearers.  Saturday, November 17th, 2012.  He's not going to do it.  You know why?  He's not going to do it.  And you can pick.  It's the beginning of his vacation.  He's taking that next week off.  No, because vacation starts on Sunday.  Because Saturday, November 17th.  Thursday.  Thursday.  He's off that Friday, too.  Well, he's going to be on on Saturday, and I will hype it up for you on Friday.  You have more time if you're on vacation to do it.  That's true. 
[03:59:30]  That's true.  Prep on Friday.  Because 6 p.m. Eastern, you're the main event.  We'll start with Roland's food court, because that's going to be a disaster.  But I don't even know if we're going to be able to pull that one off.  Yes, we can.  Because we'll get a couple different people around the city to bring food.  You'll get that going?  And he can sample it on air, talk about the texture, talk about the taste.  I'm going to put you in charge of that, Troy.  We'll get him a gavel.  Okay.  Yes.  Troy, you're executive producer of the food court.  Yeah.  But I want something also in with sexist show. 
[04:00:00]  Okay.  I think we're all going to take...  Night court.  Who's going to be...  Eric, who's your executive producer...  No, we're down with food court.  Who's your executive producer of Bagel and with the Sex?  I don't know.  You just came up with this.  Name your producer right...  It's one of us, obviously.  So name your executive producer.  You've got Sal, Travis...  You can't take me.  I'm already pretending to executive produce another show.  You've got Sal, Travis, Troy, who's already executive producing food court, Danny, or me.  Who's your executive producer?  Let's see.  You don't know how to run a board. 
[04:00:30]  No, I don't.  So Sam's out.  Wow.  Who's going to be your executive producer, Eric?  Do you want to give Sal the big break?  No.  Wow.  That was a bad call.  Sal, you are the executive producer.  Wow.  You easily picked the worst.  That was the worst choice.  Well, due to the lack of interest on everyone's faces here, I thought...  I would have done it.  I would have done it.  Everyone would have done it.  Four guys here have spat out creative ideas for bageling with the sex.  Yeah, for me to do it, not for you to tell me to do it. 
[04:01:00]  And one guy has been silent.  You picked the silent guy to be your executive producer.  That's what he wants.  He wants it to be very vague.  We don't know what's going to happen.  Oh, my God.  That was terrible.  Well, we're all going to have to chip in and help Sal.  That was an awful idea, Eric.  But, Sal, you're the executive producer.  It's fine with me.  You're in here November 17th.  That's fine.  Eric, are you committed?  We're going to do production.  I told you.  It's going to be one hour.  What's if he doesn't show up?  Then I'm hosting the show.  And I'm going to fucking spend an hour dismantling everything that is Eric's life. 
[04:01:30]  That's what's going to happen.  Do you do the highlights of Eric over the years?  Eric, if you don't show up, me, Travis, Danny, and Troy are coming in here and doing a live worst of Eric's name.  It's up to you.  Jeez, I wonder why I never pitched to do a show on this channel before.  It's up to you.  If you're not going to show up, you're not going to show up.  But there's going to be a show that day.  We're only going to do that if you don't show up.  Bageling with the sex is happening.  It's up to you to define it.  That's such a horrible title.  It's not a horrible title.  It's a fucking horrible title.  It's not.  And it's just a trial thing anyway. 
[04:02:00]  If Bageling with the sex, it's a pilot.  It was the Seinfeld Chronicles turned into Seinfeld.  Exactly.  Eventually, we'll just be Bageling.  Yeah.  So.  You're the one who came up with the name, Eric.  Not us.  I didn't come up with shit.  Sex Bagel?  No, no, no, no.  Don't try to pin that on me.  You brought it here, though.  Bageling?  Yeah, I brought it here.  But the rest of this is all you.  You never had to be Sex Bagel on the Opie and Anthony show, but you were.  You could have just been Eric Nagel.  No, because on my old stuff, I was Sex Bagel.  He's been Sex Bagel way before the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:02:30]  Are you committed to this, Eric?  No, I know.  But what we're saying is he could have stopped.  He could have just been Eric Nagel.  Right.  He loves the name.  Everybody knows that.  There's no reason to debate it.  Eric, are you committed to this?  Yes or no?  Yeah, I guess.  Yes!  November 17th!  Afternoon Sex!  Afternoon Sex!  No, we're bageling.  It's bageling.  Afternoon Sex or bageling with the sex.  Bageling with the sex.  It's just bageling with the sex.  We're going to have promos.  We're going to have everything.  Our guy didn't win, okay? 
[04:03:00]  There's a concession speech that needs to be made, and we're making it.  We're going to go.  We're going to let Ron and Fez take over, and we're going to start prepping for bageling  with the sex right now, one week from this Saturday.  And the food court.  And the food court.  Wow, we're going to have to talk to Roland about that.  Troy, you're in charge of that.  I'm in.  All right.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Thank you, everybody.  Ron, I love food court.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
