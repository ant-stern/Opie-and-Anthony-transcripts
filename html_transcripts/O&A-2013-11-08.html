<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with extremely vulgar and sexually explicit language, immediately setting the tone for the entire show.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jimmy "Tranny," launched into a discussion about the firing of high school volleyball coach Lorraine Cook for a Facebook photo depicting her fiancé's hand on her breast.  They debated the appropriateness of the firing, the oversensitivity of modern society, and the prevalence of "rats" – people who anonymously report minor infractions online. This led to a broader conversation about human nature, the desire for attention, and a perceived lack of empathy.

The conversation shifted to New York City schools eliminating the grade of "zero," replacing it with a 55 as the lowest possible grade.  The hosts and callers, including a teacher, debated the implications of this policy on student motivation and its disconnect from the real world.

Next, the show delved into a retrospective review of photos from the show's archives ("OA Photos" on Twitter), showcasing past outrageous and sexually explicit stunts.  These included "cripple fights" (blind and one-legged boxing), a road show featuring nudity and lesbian activity in a kiddie pool, and an incident involving a woman being tarred and feathered on air.  Photos featured guests such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ron Jeremy. The hosts reflected on their past, more unrestrained broadcasting style compared to their current, more constrained environment.  Numerous sexually explicit jokes and comments punctuated this segment.

A significant portion of the show focused on a look back at past Friday broadcasts.  The hosts reminisced about numerous outrageous and sexually explicit events and guests, including Al Snow, Jay Moores, Nikki Sterling, Rodney Dangerfield, Jim Florentine, Rich Voss, Mini Kiss, Musical Dildos, Ken Stevens, Tracy Lourdes, Stephanie McMahon (pre-augmentation), Shannon Love, and Casey Kasem (whose health was also discussed).  Recounted events included increasingly wild Friday broadcasts involving excessive alcohol consumption, shot girls, scantily-clad or naked women, contests like a MILF contest, an ass contest, "Team Week," and "Puke Fest" (which involved consuming a fish eyeball from a woman's armpit and vagina).  Bikini softball games and the participation of underage girls in “Teen Week” were also discussed.  Listener-submitted photos depicting these events, many sexually explicit, were reviewed.  The hosts discussed their old, larger studio, the evolution of workplace HR policies, and Jim Norton's new website with animated album covers featuring his face. A listener's call promoting a road trip was abruptly ended.  A discussion about 70's music, Casey Kasem's health, and the appropriateness of Jimmy Kimmel's Halloween candy prank also occurred. The segment ended with a discussion of various radio sign-offs and a search for a video of a soldier's surprise homecoming.

The show then featured a discussion of a poorly-made basketball video that inexplicably went viral, followed by the announcement of "barbecue day" for Roland's birthday.  A prank call impersonating a pretentious chef was made.  A listener's dog dedication prompted Opie's rant about transitioning between upbeat and somber music.  Colin Quinn called in, discussing a planned road trip with Bobo, who unexpectedly announced he'd invited Bill Burr without consulting Colin. This led to a heated discussion about funding (Bobo requested $10,000 from Opie and Anthony) and driving (Bobo, despite lacking a driver's license). Lady Di joined the call, adding to the chaos; her attempts to DM Anthony on Twitter and Opie's attempts to teach her Twitter usage resulted in her accidentally making her phone number public.  The conversation then shifted to Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto, playing audio clips of his erratic behavior and mentioning wrestlers (Iron Sheik and Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake) who visited his office; audio clips of the Iron Sheik were played.  Further discussion of Rob Ford, Jay-Z's boycott of Barney's, and the Daily Show's commentary ensued, with several deceased wrestlers mentioned.

A lengthy discussion ensued regarding Jay-Z's business dealings and perceived inconsistencies on racial issues, using highly offensive language, including repeated use of the n-word. The hosts criticized Jay-Z and other rappers for commercial endorsements and a perceived lack of consistent activism. The conversation moved to Comedy Central's censorship of the n-word, even from Black comedians like Richard Pryor, expressing frustration at the perceived double standard.  The second half of this segment focused on Roland's birthday barbecue featuring Ubon's Barbecue from Mississippi, with enthusiastic consumption of pulled pork and cake.  Guests included Ubon Roark and unnamed interns, with numerous jokes, some sexually suggestive and offensive. A caller mentioned comedian Jerry Clower.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of the food and further jokes, promoting Ubon’s Barbecue.

The show's final segment centered on Roland's birthday celebration, featuring cake and a large amount of pork, which Roland initially hoarded.  Rob Cross ("E-Rock") was a guest. The discussion included commentary on the attractiveness of Hits 1 interns, leading to jokes about their reactions to the pork.  Several callers phoned in, some expressing admiration for Sam Roberts, others expressing dissatisfaction; one caller recounted a bizarre fan encounter.  The fallout from Lady Di's phone number release was discussed, with callers interacting with her.  Comparisons to Howard Stern's show, including after-shows, were made. A Hits 1 intern discussed her experiences.  Sam Roberts promoted his upcoming show, featuring guests like Zachary Levi and Diamond Dallas Page, and advertised Steven Singer Jewelers.  The segment was filled with vulgar language and crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, I mean, this is insane. 
[00:00:30]  So flatulent.  Why don't we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Point simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  The Alby and Anthony show.  Another four hours is long.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Check.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  Put Opie Anthony.  Yeah.  Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people to say in this old.  Objectional human beings and I want you to look unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Go.  Go.  I know you're building the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking.  Jimmy's trying to get blown.  They would come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of your chair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Check out.  It's the Opie Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now my ties up in this bitch.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  What the fuck are you doing?  We love it.  Absolutely what's happening.  We love it.  We love it.  Yes, indeed.  Let's bring that to the show immediately.  Oh, I have it here somewhere.  I thought we talked about it on our show, but maybe it was... 
[00:02:30]  It was Red Eye last night.  I was...  What a brilliant appearance I had on Red Eye.  See, I heard just the opposite.  Oh, Jesus.  What, when you were on?  No, no, no.  When I walked out, O'Reilly, Hannity, and Rupert Murdoch were all outside the Red Eye thing,  and they went, applause, applause.  Wow.  Yeah, so we were talking about the woman coach.  I guess she was a, what, volleyball or some shit?  I think volleyball high school coach, I believe. 
[00:03:00]  And she posted a picture on her Facebook site for one day.  She had it up for one day, like, months ago.  Why only one day?  Because she knew it might be a problem.  I think she might have even known, like, eh, maybe I shouldn't have this on, or a friend  probably told her.  Lorraine Cook, right?  Oh, Cook.  Yes.  Lorraine or Lorraine Cook.  She was on vacation with her boyfriend.  Pretty fucking hot there, too, by the way.  Or is it a husband?  Fiancé.  Fiancé.  Okay, so they're going to get married.  Yeah.  They're in some tropical lawn.  Right, right.  And he's got his hand on her tit. 
[00:03:30]  That's all.  You know, a friendly little thing.  It's not like he's got his cock between her tits or anything.  What a weird picture to take on vacation, though.  Kind of funny.  You know, it's one of those just goofy, you know, they're a fun little couple there.  Well, they're both smiling toward the camera, like, innocently.  And then, you know, the goof is he's got his hand on her tit.  And apparently they're being photobombed right in between the two of them.  You got a photobomb.  You got a photobomb.  So, I guess she had this up on her Facebook site for one day, months ago. 
[00:04:00]  And then, out of nowhere, somebody sends the picture off to her employer, the school that she's coaching at.  Right.  And they fire her.  Right.  We're living in a time now where we put up our personal pictures.  And this isn't even that bad.  It's a fun, goofy picture.  It's a silly moment.  Right.  But years ago, that would have been in a stack of photos in an envelope or in a photo album if it made it that far.  Whatever.  Right.  Whatever. 
[00:04:30]  To show your friends and family or to just sit there for years on end with no one looking at it.  But now we're able to post these pictures.  Our private lives go out there in the way of these photos.  And we're putting it out to a public that wants nothing more than to find a way to fuck over somebody.  For no apparent reason.  No personal.  You don't even know these people.  But to just fuck someone over as this little power base that you could have. 
[00:05:00]  So it's a double-edged sword in that you're putting your own pictures out there.  Right.  So you can almost find a way to rationalize it that you can blame her for saying, well, you put the picture out there.  She should sue.  She probably will.  It has nothing to do with her job.  None.  She's on vacation.  That's it.  And it's not a nude photo or any of that.  Obviously, it's just kind of a goof.  I was saying that, too.  It's like, how can you then look at this picture and what she's doing in this picture and then tie it to it being detrimental to her job or the children that she's teaching? 
[00:05:30]  Just something.  Like, if she was smoking crack or something, and we'll get into that later, I guess.  Oh, Rob Ford rules.  Oh, he's great.  God, I hope he doesn't step down.  But she's not doing anything there that's detrimental.  Yeah, I get it.  We all get it.  Yeah.  The problem is, you know, social networking could be a really cool thing.  But what you learn, and I think we've all learned, meaning everyone in this room and everyone listening to our voices, that there's a lot of shitty people out there. 
[00:06:00]  Just scumbags looking to fuck people over.  We've been in the public eye a long, long time, and I never realized how many shitty people there actually are in the world.  And at every turn, like you said, they're willing to, you know, try to fuck you over.  Just try to fuck you over.  For real innocent shit, too.  And what is the desire?  What does that do for people to see?  Like, knowing that we all do it.  It's a power.  It's people that have no sense of power in their lives. 
[00:06:30]  They're shit on by their dumb bosses, their wives, their parents, whatever the fuck it is.  They have zero power in life.  So they see an opportunity where they can, all of a sudden, affect someone else's life.  So they're like, this is great.  I get to shit on someone, finally.  It's human nature.  It's fucking human nature.  This social networking thing is putting us down this road.  We're right at the precipice of the whole thing. 
[00:07:00]  Where we'll see how it really is going to affect things down the line a little more.  But it's definitely having an effect on humanity.  It's going to shut down people.  They're not going to be, you know, willing to offer up these pictures or anything like that.  But I think that's another part of human nature that you can't get away from.  This want and need to be looked at.  And look at me.  The guy, supposedly, is the football coach at the same school.  Yes.  Now, why didn't he get in trouble? 
[00:07:30]  I don't want him to get in trouble.  Maybe he didn't post it.  Probably because he didn't post it.  He didn't post it.  She did.  That's my guess.  So if she gets in trouble for posting this photo.  Well, I said he's the football coach.  And I was saying he was just teaching the kids how to hold the ball.  There you go.  That's funny, man.  Nice.  That's nice sexist humor.  That's what we need to pass on.  Sexist humor.  What if kids hear that?  I apologize.  That's great to just make a mockery of it.  SiriusXM wants to apologize for Anthony Cumia's statement. 
[00:08:00]  It's a crazy world.  Yeah.  It's getting crazier every day, too.  It really is.  We are so walking on eggshells at this point.  A bunch of rats out there.  Because there's rats at every corner now.  A lot of rats.  Rats.  There's rats everywhere.  So you've got to walk on eggshells.  And sometimes, you know, you don't even know you're putting yourself out there to get fucked over.  Like that, she even knew.  If she only had that up for a day, even she looked at that and said, oh, I'm a teacher. 
[00:08:30]  This might be a problem.  But that should mean something in this case.  Exactly.  She probably put the picture up there.  And somebody, you know, at school or whatever, a close friend or her mom, whoever the fuck's, probably said, that could be a problem.  And she's thinking, really?  But then started thinking about it and said, oh, man, maybe it will be a problem.  And I think it's really important to the case that she took it off her Facebook page.  Right.  She showed responsibility.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But that amounted to nothing.  Because she got fired anyway.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  We can't balance as a society, as intelligent people between that and what is a truly inappropriate or sexually explicit photo.  Right.  We're just, it's dishonest.  Right.  People like to watch each other get in trouble for the same shit they do.  Oh, yeah.  And that's the sickness of it.  It's like a sick thing, man.  Yeah.  We like to see you get in trouble.  Guaranteed, if you pawed through the photo mine, the mine of photos that are out there from these people that have turned other people in, you'll find shit that could get them in trouble. 
[00:09:30]  It's endless, really.  It really is amazing.  And I don't know why we crave that.  Why don't we give each other a break?  Like, why don't we just go, hey, man, you know what?  That was a little stupid, but she took it down.  I've done it, too.  Mind your own beeswax, I say.  Why don't we have that in our psyche anymore?  Because hate is stronger than love.  Oh, my God.  Hate is stronger than love out there.  Jesus Christ.  I see Opie quotes today.  Thank you.  On Twitter.  Thank you.  No, you're not wrong, you know.  I mean.  Yes.  There's a lot of hate out there. 
[00:10:00]  There certainly is.  We should just be hugging each other and loving each other.  What does that do for people, though?  What does it do?  Like, what does it serve?  It serves some kind of need.  What need does it serve?  What it does, it makes you not want to go outside because you realize there's a lot of fucking creeps out there.  It's just fucking hating people out there.  And we were discussing it last night, even in the green room, before we even did the show, about people that just hate other people on Twitter.  And it's amazing.  It doesn't matter who you are, what you do, what you look like, anything. 
[00:10:30]  Like, people will just shit on other people like that.  It's amazing.  It's an epidemic.  Yeah.  And it doesn't change.  And people get mad when you say things like, well, I like that the NSA spies because it gives everybody a chance to see how fucking ugly that feels, how nosy we are.  Right, right.  But we bring this on ourselves.  Yeah.  We bring it.  There's not some big government making everything happen.  This is the mentality of the public.  I've said it in the past, as far as the 1984 thing went, back when it was 1984 and before that, when we had this image of what the future was going to be like. 
[00:11:00]  It was always these government cameras from these secret agencies that we didn't know where this information went and Big Brother is watching you.  I mean, all that stuff.  And a few short years later, it turned out that we ourselves were that entity.  We had turned in, the collective public had turned into Big Brother, and we're the ones ratting each other out and videotaping each other and posting it for everyone to see. 
[00:11:30]  It's one of the most amazing turn of events out of anything in society.  But that was in the book.  Was it?  Yes, where people would rat each other out.  Well, that's kind of a Nazi Germany thing.  It was in the book that people were, you know, encouraged to rat each other out.  But it was because.  I love that fucking book.  It was also because the government was watching you with their various ways to record you and cameras, so you would rat out your neighbor to protect yourself. 
[00:12:00]  But it's not this government entity.  It's everybody else.  It's pretty damn close, though.  That book is pretty damn close to what the hell's going on in our world.  But I don't think we ever thought it was going to be each other.  That we would be the fucking source of the problem.  You never thought that?  No.  I never saw that coming.  It was always going to be the government with their satellites and cameras up on poles and these drones that are flying over and taking pictures of you. 
[00:12:30]  It was never supposed to be each other with this handheld camera.  Think about it.  We have these little handheld video devices that we point at every little thing that happens and then put it on this collective viewing device for everyone to see people's mistakes, foibles, indiscretions.  And we judge it like we don't do the same stuff. 
[00:13:00]  Yes!  It's a sickness.  And that's why we are the problem.  And if we were a country that didn't tolerate this shit with each other, the government wouldn't do it.  Yeah.  They wouldn't do it.  They wouldn't dare do it if they knew we wouldn't tolerate it.  But they're us.  People that are sitting in those fucking offices, they're not from a magic planet.  They're the same guys that fucking cut you off in traffic.  Right.  They're the same people that go and buy K-O-Pectate because they can't stop shitting.  They're us.  And we fucking bring this on ourselves. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  Yes.  That is a symptom of how much we love to be little fucking nosy voyeurs.  Nudge.  Nudge.  A little nudge.  Love it.  And we sit there and we watch you swing and we rub our little hands together and go, ooh, isn't that fun to watch?  Yeah.  We suck.  Right around the corner, it could be you.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Some people understand that.  I was saying also, I'm so glad that we have this despicable reputation because we're able to get away with a little bit more as far as what we post and say because we're looked at like the scourge of society in many ways. 
[00:14:00]  But if you have a job as a teacher or some type of influential person, the slightest little slip up will get you in trouble.  But people also have to realize that that's the culture and you can't even take that chance.  No.  You've got to be smart.  No, you're right.  You've got to be smart.  With the low expectations that we have.  They're all looking to fuck you over or the company's looking for an excuse to get rid of you.  Yep. 
[00:14:30]  Speaking of school really fast in the paper, this is mind-boggling.  You know they're not giving zeros away anymore in some of the schools in New York City?  What, like for failure?  Failure now.  Failure's not an option.  They feel that it's really bad to give a student a zero.  Yeah.  So the lowest grade you can get is a 55.  A 55 is failing.  Wow.  One foot on the brake and one on the gas.  Hey!  Damn it.  So they did the math in the paper.  So you could not show up for school. 
[00:15:00]  You get your 55, and then all you have to do is get an 85 on the final or the midterm.  That will get you an average of 65, and you will pass.  How did I not graduate?  How amazing is that?  Because they don't want to give out zeros or anything lower than a 55?  This goes hand-in-hand with the no child left behind kind of a thing.  You know, they don't want failure.  They don't want to look better as schools, I think. 
[00:15:30]  I think they want to have more people passing, even though they don't know how to read and write.  But you could look at the school and go, wow, look at the statistics.  Right.  Wow.  Under our leadership, we're passing more students now.  But meanwhile, there's no substance to it.  They're just as stupid as they've ever been.  It's dumb.  Here it is.  55 is the new zero and crazy grade change.  Go ahead, kids.  Goof off.  It's great inflation on a citywide scale.  Emails provided to the Daily News shows it has become common practice for city high schools 
[00:16:00]  to abandon the traditional 0 to 100 grading scale for one that gives kids no lower than a 55 score,  just 10 points below passing, even when they don't show up for class.  Students can pass a class without showing up for the rest of the term,  as long as they score an 85 or higher in the first of three marking periods.  All you have to do is...  Because then that would average you out to the 65, which is a passing grade.  I think if you let Mr. Hand in during the night of the last big party and study with him for a few hours, 
[00:16:30]  you'll pass the class.  And then you could, once you cruise the class, you don't even have to go to that side of the building.  Well, that's how you learn about Cuba.  We all know.  Eating some food.  You got to eat some fucking pizza.  A student gets a...  That is unbelievable.  Hamilton, Kornfeld, Brent.  Let's get a good one.  But there are kids that just don't fucking want to do well at school.  They don't give a fuck.  But now they don't have to.  That's great. 
[00:17:00]  Now you made it easier for them not to give a fuck.  So you'll get more morons coming out of school that will be dependent on the government and whatnot.  It's un-fucking-believable.  Yeah.  We're gearing up.  Hey, did you see what...  Oh, wait.  Before we move on, because it sounds like you're going to move on.  We've got a teacher.  I want to get a teacher's perspective on what you just said.  Hey, teach.  Joe in New York, go ahead.  Yeah, you know, everything you're saying is true.  We're not allowed to give out zeros anymore.  The lowest grade we can give out ever is a 50. 
[00:17:30]  And I'm in a public school in Westchester County in New York.  And the only thing that saves us a little bit is we have an attendance policy where if  they exceed a certain amount of absences, they can't get credit at all.  But if you're getting lower than a 50, like the old days, like when we were going to school,  you just didn't either...  You either didn't give a fuck about school or that particular school wasn't for you. 
[00:18:00]  And you had to move on to, you know...  Yeah.  One of the...  You had to move on to the other side of the school, if you know what I mean.  Our high school had the other side of the school.  Oh, boy.  Where the slow ones were.  And I always remember there was almost like a cutoff in the hallway.  And if you step past that line, they got into creepy territory.  I was a habitual tardy person and absenteeism.  So they put me in the special...  Oh, you went special for a while. 
[00:18:30]  I was in Father Junipero-Sara Continuation School.  Oh, they made it sound cool.  I had to go to con school.  It sounds cool, though.  We called it BOCES, I think, or something like that.  Well, that was different.  I went to con school, which was kind of cool because it was like you were a con.  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  You know, even though it meant continuation, it sounded like convict.  I thought it was kind of cool.  I walked around like a tough guy.  Oh.  Yeah.  And it was me and all the...  It was me and literally Jeff Spicoli's walking around the class.  That's a dork. 
[00:19:00]  That's a dork.  I personally would be all in with these changes if it matched up with how the real world works.  Oh, yeah.  That's where you're fucking everybody coming up.  Because they're not going to be coddled when they go for their first job.  No, it's not this smooth transition between school and real life anymore.  It's this cliff.  Right.  That they push them out now.  And it doesn't resemble one iota what they went through in school.  So now you're just kind of fucked.  They expect a huge promotion, a huge raise day one.  No zeros. 
[00:19:30]  They don't understand why they're not getting that.  Yeah.  They don't understand why other people are passing them by in the workplace.  Because they haven't been trained for that shit.  Yep.  They haven't been trained as far as competition goes.  And dealing with failure and rejection.  Kids today, they seem to not understand that.  Because parents are so insecure.  You're taught they want their kids to be perfect.  They're taught that everything they do is good.  And that was great.  And, hey, there's no wrong answer.  There are wrong answers.  There are wrong answers sometimes. 
[00:20:00]  It's okay.  You stink at certain things.  Find what you're good at.  And I'm so glad I'm in the schooling system now.  So I got a take on all this.  I didn't have to go, thank God.  It was one of those things.  We decided I could stay home.  But it was like a dinner at the school.  Oh.  With other parents.  The kids weren't there.  Just to socialize and stuff.  And it was asked of my kid, how many languages does he know already?  What? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  My kid's three.  Three and a half almost.  Isn't it pretty much the one that he hears on a daily basis?  Gaga goo goo.  Gaga goo goo.  Huh?  Oh, Jesus.  And my wife joked that he doesn't know any languages officially.  Right.  Because he's fucking up the one he's.  He can barely.  And they all just stared at her like, oh, my God.  Don't you take this serious?  I'm so sorry.  Right.  And then, like, there was a discussion.  And a few of the kids in the classroom know two or three languages already.  That's insane.  I don't want my kid to be like that. 
[00:21:00]  I want my kid to be a kid.  And find a balance between the two.  Aren't they parents who speak different languages at home, though?  That's probably why.  That's probably why.  Like Spanish or you're from.  Or they dump them off on a fucking nanny long enough where they start picking up the native language of the nanny.  He got a welly yesterday.  He's one of those guys raised in one area.  His parents from another.  Right.  He's going to speak a couple languages.  He's a sharp cookie, that guy.  Oh, he's a really smart guy, yeah.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  Let me say hi to Aaron.  Hot teacher.  Check it in.  Got it bad. 
[00:21:30]  What?  Got it bad.  Got it bad.  Hold on.  My dick's hard from this sexy call.  What happened?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get ahead, Aaron.  I've got to defend myself here.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Opie is.  Opie likes it.  Opie likes it.  Opie likes it.  Hello.  Hello.  What a queer baby.  Yo.  Ew.  Sal's on the phones, right?  Yes.  Sal.  Can I press it, Aaron?  Have you ever seen a guy's name spelled E-R-I-N? 
[00:22:00]  No.  I don't know what the male version of that would be.  A-A-R-O-N.  That spells Aaron.  Yes.  I'll change it for you.  Don't worry.  By the way, my little rant a few minutes ago, I was thinking about you the entire time.  The entire time.  I knew that, but you didn't have to say.  I wanted to make it hurt a little more just in case he was wondering.  Yeah.  Because he can't spell Aaron.  He doesn't even know how to spell Aaron.  No.  Or Aaron.  Actually, it is Aaron. 
[00:22:30]  Sal, you get a 55 today.  Oh.  Because he can't get Missouri.  That's right.  I have to change all my insults.  Like, oh, God, do I feel like a 55?  Oh, yeah.  That sucks.  That's when you have the same brain to it.  No.  No.  If I fuck a girl, now I have to tell you, you have 55 chance of me marrying you if I knock you up.  Aaron, not Aaron, what's up?  You're a teacher in Broome County.  Yeah, I'm a high school teacher.  And actually, though, the way that our system works, they actually pass all the middle school students, no matter what. 
[00:23:00]  That's good.  So when they get to me, and I'm a freshman teacher, when they get to me, they think they're going to pass automatically, but they actually get stuck in freshman math until they truly pass it.  Good.  And that's just a terrible system that just, you know, it really fails them for three years in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.  I wish I would have went to school during times like this.  Hey, look, they do the same thing in college.  I'm a teacher.  I'm not even allowed to take away from a kid's grade if he is unprepared for class. 
[00:23:30]  Remember, if you were unprepared, that would hurt you.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Wow.  It's true about the schools.  In 1988, math teachers said, you pass the regents, you pass the class.  But now we've got a guy that has to explain the zero thing.  Go ahead, Adam.  Hey, fellas.  Hi, Adam.  He is the new zero.  I'm a teacher out in Ohio, and they specifically told us this was geared towards high school students who didn't show up, and they didn't want to discourage them from giving up. 
[00:24:00]  And so 50 meant that they could still possibly pass the class if they showed up the rest of the quarter.  But you see, but you see, the problem with that is that they're saying, like, if you don't, we're trying to encourage you to pass, which is really good.  But, like, you're not doing what you're supposed to do.  What if you're beyond the point of no return with being absent?  You can't possibly pass.  And that's up to the fucking parents again to get their kid in line.  That's what happened to me.  This all comes down to parenting in the end. 
[00:24:30]  Christ.  Somehow it became our responsibility to make sure these kids get their butts in class.  Right.  Even the ones, I'll tell you, I had a kid a couple years ago who didn't show up, basically never showed up three out of the four quarters of school.  I ended up taking the class, quote-unquote, online, and managed to learn a year's worth of stuff in about six weeks.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Oh, man.  God bless him.  All right, well.  All right, I'm going to now.  I wish I had that option. 
[00:25:00]  Well, can we continue talking about school, but let's make it really hot here.  Oh, come on.  What?  Cheerleading coach busted for having me back on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My cock's still hard.  I don't know how you're talking with a rod over there.  Hot and sexy football.  Cheerleading coach busted for having sex with students during school hours.  Whoa.  Yes.  No.  What happened here?  A Pennsylvania cheerleading coach has allegedly been busted for having sex with a student.  What's she look like? 
[00:25:30]  She's right.  All right, man.  She's at a Phillies game.  She certainly is.  Got a little Phillies t-shirt on.  Yeah.  And I guess the person that is kind of blocked out there must be the student.  Oh.  The student's taller than her.  That looks like a big student, right?  Yeah.  If the student's taller than the teacher, then I think it's okay.  That's okay.  It should all be based on height.  That means you've got a lot of hair on your balls.  How great would it be if that was the argument?  Your Honor, look at how tall my crying is.  All right.  Dismissed.  Let's see.  The Nicole Kurwowski, 27, is accused of having sex with the unnamed 17-year-old several times 
[00:26:00]  during school hours.  God damn, is that hot.  During school hours.  Can you imagine?  That's pretty good.  An investigation began after school officials got a tip that two were sexually involved.  See?  Another rat.  Another rat.  Another rat.  You can't people keep their fucking yaps shut.  Cops say two spoke on the phone daily and exchanged explicit text messages.  They were careful not to get caught, meeting for some trysts in an unconspicuous area near 
[00:26:30]  a nursing home.  Kurwowski was charged with institutional sexual assault and has been released on $25,000.  Institutional sexual assault.  What is that?  Look that up.  I guess that's...  Is that in the hiney hole?  Is that sex in the hiney hole?  Hiney hole.  Little butt play.  Right.  She worked at the school for two years and taught physical ed.  Wow.  This is pretty good.  My physical ed teacher didn't look like that.  No. 
[00:27:00]  In addition to serving as cheerleading coach.  So...  Mmm.  Northwest of Philly is where this went down.  Damn.  That is a good story right there.  Teachers gotta understand that you just can't fuck the students.  I understand the temptation.  Doesn't that sound like something you shouldn't even have to say?  Yeah, like...  Don't fuck the students.  Right, of course.  That's why I don't do that for a living.  Right.  If you were allowed to fuck high school girls, and that was part of the job, I probably would  have done much better in high school.  Right. 
[00:27:30]  So I could stick around and get my dick wet.  Exactly.  There's our school break.  Yeah.  Running the gamut there.  Pretty darn good so far.  There was always those fucking questionable janitors around the school that was a little too...  They were a little too friendly with the students.  No, yeah.  They'd be pushing that garbage pail around with the broom, but they'd stop in the back  hall and talk to some of the students that were a little more, you know, rebellious.  Well, they were probably the drug dealers.  Yeah, maybe the drug dealers or trying to...  Trying a little pot on them.  Trying to get in there with some of the students. 
[00:28:00]  And there's always the cool teacher.  You know, the cool teacher.  A little younger than the rest of the staff.  But what's that about?  I used to like the cool teachers, but in the end, what's that about?  I think it's...  What's that about, you think?  Trying to get in there.  I think there might be a little of that going on.  If there's no real age difference between the students and the teacher, there's going  to be these attractions and fucking feelings and things that go on.  It's very hard to hold that shit back just because you're a teacher.  It's not this ethics thing that comes into play like a lawyer or doctor. 
[00:28:30]  We had a teacher who got in trouble for trying to spike the drink of another teacher.  Whoa, wow.  Like, I don't know, he was drugging.  He was a guy that had been rumored to be weird.  And he, at some function, this was before all these cameras, someone observed him like  sprinkling something into the drink of another teacher.  So, the person who saw it just went over and knocked the drink over like it was an accident.  Wow.  And then I think they reported him and they saw him doing it again and he got arrested.  It was a whole thing. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, we had a student try to put speed in old Dick Shanley's fucking coffee, the shop  teacher.  Old Dick Shanley.  Why did he want to do that?  He did it.  And Dick Shanley drank the fucking coffee and had to leave.  He had to go to the doctor because his heart was racing.  Jesus.  Put a little fucking, opened up a Black Beauty or some shit and sprinkled it in there.  He drank it.  And then that kid like just kind of got in trouble.  He got like suspended.  Now he'd go to fucking jail.  How'd they know what he put in?  How'd they know it was him, first of all?  He told everybody. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, that'd be it.  Went around the school.  Yeah, if you do that, you gotta brag about it.  Spiked Dick Shanley's fucking coffee.  There was a time you could brag about your shit without the rats getting involved.  Yeah, yeah.  He was the kid that if you brought in an M-80 and you were too much of a pussy to like  flush it down the toilet yourself, you gave it to this kid and he would do it.  Okay.  He was like the kid that just, he was too small for his age.  Like he looked like he belonged in junior high and high school and shit like that. 
[00:30:00]  So he was always trying to prove himself.  Right.  So you could just get him to do fucking anything.  Here, blow this up or fucking start this on fire.  And he'd be like, okay.  A little maniac.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  But no one, no one ever got in trouble like to that point.  The worst thing I ever saw happen in school was one of the students was kind of really  fucking drunk and had to be taken out in a wheelchair through the lobby and everything.  And there were cops there escorting him out and medical staff. 
[00:30:30]  And he was just like leaning over with a bucket on the, uh, a bucket on the side of the wheelchair  because he was puking.  Holy shit.  And they just kind of wheeled him out.  And we all looked like, ah, fuck, look, he's all fucked up.  The only thing my high school had was black chicks passing out during class.  What?  That's the only thing I remember.  Black chicks passing out?  Black chicks would get lightheaded and pass out.  And in Harborfields that meant two people.  We had a few.  Why were they in the same class as you? 
[00:31:00]  Oh man, I can't agree with you more.  Exactly.  That's where this country fell apart.  Probably guilt from drinking from the wrong water fountain.  That's right.  They knew they'd stolen water from the white man.  You think they might've been pregnant?  Oh, you guys did have that part over the tracks.  Where it was a little.  We had our blacks.  Yeah.  We had a couple in Elwood, but.  We didn't have our blacks in junior high school.  I was pretty amazed when I went to, well, we had a couple in junior high.  That's when I started being amazed by black people. 
[00:31:30]  Because we were pretty isolated.  We were isolated in Centerport.  And then by high school, holy shit.  Yeah, we had the blacks.  Those side streets in Greenlawn.  Man, we were as fucking amazed by black people in our school as we were with the midget.  And the one chick with the crippled people, braces, crutches.  It's funny, I don't see you going on midgetmania.com.  Yeah, it didn't have the same effect.  No, no, I guess not. 
[00:32:00]  You don't mind when little midgets come Halloween trick-or-treating, and then again, 50 midgets  don't run in and fucking knock everything over a 7-11.  Midgets don't have giant cocks that women secretly crave.  Yeah.  I had my meeting with Tim Sabian.  One of the things was I want the phones fixed.  And they said, oh, God, we'll be right on it.  And we'll have it fixed tomorrow.  Oh, I thought you were taking a phone call from runtime error 76.  Well, and then I do this.  Watch what happens.  Goodbye.  Oh, you X out runtime error and the phones disappear. 
[00:32:30]  And then I do this.  And now this time they're totally gone.  It was all those callers.  Let me ask you a question about the Tim Sabian.  Did you also have to slide down your pants and have Tim make love to you from the back?  I did.  I did.  He said it was going to be all of us.  It was good because he lubed it up, though, by licking my asshole.  Yeah.  He spit in mine.  And the curtains were open in the office, so everybody was watching.  Well, you've got to allow others to watch.  Absolutely.  Steve Blatter was in there just nodding.  Yeah, yeah.  New problem.  We just wiped out 12 really good phone calls. 
[00:33:00]  I know.  I saw that.  Not that the listener's going to be bummed about it, but.  Yeah, let's be honest.  Probably a couple of very good phone calls.  But all the phones.  Now the phones are coming back.  Oh, wait.  Are they still there?  Yeah, this was supposed to be taken care of.  Oh.  I don't get as upset as I used to, so maybe.  Call it.  The calls are still there.  I know, but I don't.  That time out or just wipes them out, and then we have to click a few things that I don't  feel like learning.  Oh, man.  Right?  Why bother learning it?  You can only get a 55. 
[00:33:30]  I don't want to learn.  If it's supposed to just work, why do I have to learn about the workaround?  I don't want to learn workarounds.  I just want everything to work.  What are you, MacGyver?  Speaking of E-Rock, he runs the OA Photos Twitter account.  It's OA Photos.  Oh, yeah.  We went there this morning.  E-Rock was showing me everything that he put up recently.  Titties.  Fuck.  And there's some things that we did I don't remember.  Yeah.  I look back at some of these, and I'm like, what was that? 
[00:34:00]  Who was...  Wow, that girl has a really nice set.  Those are...  Not bad.  Very, very nice natural tits that girl's got.  All right.  And who's feeling it off?  Whose hand is reaching in off the side?  Who's got the puke green sweater?  Oh, man.  All right.  What do we got up there?  You should come in here and do what you did for me.  Ken Stevens.  For these guys.  That's right.  So bring those knee pads.  If you want to see what we used to get away with in radio and where our frustration actually  comes from now that we're on satellite and we can't do stuff that we used to do on 
[00:34:30]  regular radio, you really should go to OA Photos.  This was regular radio.  What was this?  Oh, this was teen...  We did a lot of teen events.  Teen events.  Remember?  Teen lesbian for the day.  I don't know.  We just put teen in front of everything.  Oh, yeah.  We did teen week.  I haven't put those up yet.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  What did you put up?  Here.  Work the clicker there.  Work the mouse.  Work the mouse.  Ah.  There's a picture of Colin Quinn that I didn't even recognize as being Colin Quinn. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Look at someone in a Colin Quinn fat suit.  It's really strange.  He was a little chubby.  We put up the cripple fights that you used to do.  We used to come up with new cripple fights.  We're not allowed to do that anymore.  We did blind boxing.  This is blind boxing.  We did one-legged boxing.  I remember that.  Oh, God.  That poor guy.  With his eyeballs.  No.  It looks like it was gouged out with a fucking spoon.  Don't say poor guy.  That guy, he's been in the paper a bunch.  He's a big advocate, and he does very well for himself.  What a guy.  And he comes in from Long Island every day, and he has no eyes. 
[00:35:30]  He actually popped out his eyeball.  Yeah.  There's a picture of him popping out his eyeball on our show.  And then it goes into the fights of them just boxing, and then you had all these people  around the ring pushing them in the right direction.  Well, they were blind, so the second they felt something, they'd swing at it as hard  as they could.  But sometimes it was just the people watching the fight.  Well, that one guy, Dave, who calls us from time to time, Blind Dave, that guy right there,  he ended up having a bruised spleen. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  No, what was wrong with his spleen?  Can you bruise your spleen officially?  I think it was.  And then he had broken ribs from blind boxing because he couldn't protect himself.  He was wide open for these shots.  I think his name was Blind Matt, was the other guy.  Yeah, I'll tell you what.  He looked like Dave Mustaine.  Yeah.  He got his ass kicked in, and he was in bad shape after this.  But he survived, and then he was cool about it.  So you had blind boxing, and then you also had one-legged fights.  Yeah, I remember one-legged fights. 
[00:36:30]  The one-legged fights.  And they were hopping around.  Yeah, you had them, so they're just fighting in their nubs.  Yeah.  Yeah, they had to bounce around on one leg.  Just to do new shit.  We didn't have a fight.  We weren't licensed to have fights.  On a weekly basis, we had some crazy over-the-top event.  A week didn't go by without some just insane thing happening.  This next one I found the most interesting.  You did a road show at the Stone Palace. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  I remember Asbury Park.  We did.  That was a fun time.  Wow.  Look at that.  Nudity.  A lot of nudity.  Is that chick just with a fucking giant tits out?  Yeah, we had a...  Go back and look at one picture.  Oh, my God.  We had a couple thousand people show up to that one.  Wow.  And we had nothing really planned.  No, we just fucked around.  We just went on stage and just fucked around.  There's a brother Joe in the background.  Oh, there's Joe in the background there.  Wow.  That girl's a pig.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't always beautiful.  You know what? 
[00:37:30]  It didn't matter, though.  Do you remember we had the kiddie pool right in front of the stage?  Yes.  And then...  Oh, my God.  She's completely fucking naked.  Completely naked on the stage.  Showing off her vagina.  And then we had cat fights.  Remember that?  And then we filled up the kiddie pool, a really nice one, with water and bubbles.  Totally naked.  Oh, wait till you see these photos.  Shit.  That's the cat fighting, which was kind of cool.  But then it was time to go freestyle with the girls.  And they paired off in the kiddie pool. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Wait till you see...  Dude, look at her hand.  It's right on that chick's pussy.  Wait.  That's nothing.  Keep going.  Would Steve be closer?  I know, right?  Yes.  You see that a lot in these photos.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, he was a true soldier.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  She's fucking...  She's got a finger in her head.  Oh, my God.  This is fantastic.  In front of about 2,000 people at the Stone Pony.  She's holding her like a bowling ball right there.  That's great.  That is fantastic.  And there's Steve's camera.  Right.  And the girl is that girl looking at her pussy. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  God.  This is amazing.  Eating her box in a tub in front of people.  Yes.  Holy shit.  She's fucking face deep in that chick's ass.  Oh, my God.  Look at the ass on that chick.  And all the people around this fucking pool just watching.  Yep.  That's Hard Rock Johnny.  Wow.  Oh, man.  And then, look, Joe's just playing on stage as these girls are just lezzing out.  Oh, there you're singing as these girls are lezzing out.  Yeah.  Down syndrome and fully shit.  There is.  On the right.  Go back one, Yron.  Right there. 
[00:39:00]  Do you think she...  She looks like the fucking girl from American Horror Show.  Yeah.  I'm only on season one, but...  She looks a little slow.  She looks a little downy.  Oh, that chick, yeah.  Did we have a lesbian that was on the spectrum?  Who's the girl on the left?  She looks familiar.  All the way on the left.  Like that one with the short hair.  She came in a lot.  She did, right?  Her face.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, the tramp stamp.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley up there.  That's also a wet t-shirt.  That was Lady Di during her hot years. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And fucking Marion is wearing like a fucking curly Muppet wig.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing a Sammy Hagar music video wig.  But there's something to be said about being a disaster.  You don't age.  That's true.  They look exactly the same.  Well, Lady Di looks a lot worse.  That's true.  But Marion has held up in her awfulness.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Look at the amount of tits that were fucking just.  Is that what you have left?  Oh, yeah.  And Bill Brady in the back. 
[00:40:00]  Habille.  He's wearing his tank top.  Oh, look at ass eating on a steak.  Oh, my God.  She's digging right in.  That girl's face.  I remember her.  She's digging right in.  You see what that guy's saying?  You can tell, right?  Hello.  As he's watching the ass eating at the Stone Pony.  When was this?  2001?  You could buy ass eating on a credit card.  A credit card.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nose deep.  There was so much ass eating. 
[00:40:30]  Dude, this was an ass eating extravaganza.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Well, now I understand why 2,000 people showed up.  Yeah.  Who wouldn't show up to this?  This is insanity.  Tim, if we could do this in the afternoons, we'd move in a second.  But this is not what would happen anymore.  We're naked girls.  We thought we were popular.  But no, it had nothing to do with us.  We just told people, hey, man, ass eating at the Stone Pony.  Yeah.  Hang out.  That's it from my guy.  That was hot, dude.  Holy shit.  And you could...  Taz?  Taz. 
[00:41:00]  It's OA Photos, you know, on Twitter.  Really, follow that account, because Eric is slowly but surely grabbing photos.  And if you got any from the past, send them in to Eric.  Yeah.  How do we do that?  Opie Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  Yeah, if you got any photos of different angles and stuff, that would be kind of cool.  I love these little galleries for each market that you were...  Yes, we would wear their city sports jerseys.  We would have their newspapers and their local magazines.  And we would just kind of look up at the camera like, oh, we just happen to be sitting here 
[00:41:30]  reading, you know...  Chicago Cubs fans?  Yeah, yeah.  We're wearing our jerseys.  I got those jerseys still.  I should just give them away.  I'm drinking a beer.  Oh, there's a lot of that.  Yes.  I'm going to bring those jerseys in, and we're going to sign them.  I'm just going to give them away.  Yeah, might as well.  They're just taking up space in my closet.  Oh, Patty, I remember that day when she put up Ron's penis and...  Yes, she was reaching in for the tickets.  Me and Ron played with her.  U2 tickets, right?  U2 tickets, yep.  See, I remember a lot of this stuff, but every once in a while, like...  There was one...  Did you know we had a midget band that was just performing outside the studio one day? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah?  No clue.  Mini Kiss?  But if it was Mini Kiss, they would have been in makeup.  No, that's right.  That little band was called Little Kings.  Oh, Little Kings, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember Little Kings performing for us.  Yeah.  Oh, with the little black drummer.  Right.  Yeah.  What, uh...  They called him Milk Dud.  Right.  Then we're...  Little Kings.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  What year was that?  Hey, Kev?  2001.  2001, this is in June of 2001. 
[00:42:30]  Right before...  That's June of 2001, Ron Jeremy?  Right before everything changed for 9-11.  Yes, that's right before 9-11.  Wow.  Which drastically changed our show.  Changed everything.  It changed, yeah.  It changed the world.  You think of life pre-9-11 and post-9-11.  Yeah.  It's such a weird thing, 2001.  It's such a big split.  We didn't get as serious as we are now...  Yeah.  ...until 9-11 hit.  We would touch on things every once in a while, but it was more of fun and just goofing off  and shit.  More about debauchery.  Having fucking naked chicks in and fucking...  But after 9-11, it felt like you really had to start speaking up about shit in the world. 
[00:43:00]  It did change a lot.  Look at...  And this is a prime example of what was going on before.  What's her name again?  Carmen Electra.  Carmen Electra.  Oh, she's true.  Yeah.  You know what?  I thought she was the WWE broad.  Oh.  Ivory?  Ivory.  She looked like Ivory.  I remember Ivory would come in.  Of course I know.  Slash...  Slash...  Slash...  Am I diesel shirt?  No.  People think you should...  What the fuck?  Is that Montana Gun?  That's when the ice cubes flew out of her mouth and I threw them in my mouth.  Oh, I remember that.  Her ass.  Her asshole, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I meant it's her asshole, yeah.  She had...  She put ice cubes in her ass.  That's me inserting an ice cube into her asshole.  And then...  Look how we're just casually talking about this.  Also, there's Campbell's in studio for this.  Ice, yes.  And then she popped them out of her ass and Jimmy ate the ice cube.  I just threw it in my mouth and I remember the fucking...  Everybody was like...  If it popped out by accident and it flew into my hand, I was just like, oh, go for it.  And there's me.  There's me.  Look at the cat eat the canary look.  Yeah.  That's an ice cube.  The old brown canary.  Tee-hee.  You think Tim Sabian will be able to get us to do some of these things again? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  If he does, I'm the three to seven kid every day.  Look at the 69 action on the lesbian couch.  Jesus Christ.  Look at all the stains on the lesbian couch.  Oh, my God.  Oh, was that fantastic.  And the thing was, you guys were both in long-term relationships, so I would get the  benefit...  Thanks for fucking reminding me.  ...of being able to get the lap dances because you guys couldn't do it.  So I remember you'd be like, hey, Jim, see what the girls...  And the girls would do stuff to me because you guys couldn't come over and do it. 
[00:44:30]  So I really reaped the reward.  You really did, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  I think you owe us.  There's two completely naked girls all over Jimmy.  All I'm looking at is my terrible shoes.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  What else did you put up recently?  Bruce Campbell, whatever.  Campbell.  John Valby.  John Valby.  Whatever.  Oh, the John Valby show, though.  Yeah.  At Mulcahy's.  Oh, yeah.  I think this was the time we drank Mike Francesa's wine and took a couple of his  cigars.  Oh, it is, right?  Remember you had a locker there or something back in the day?  They had a VIP area with lockers. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And one of the guys there wasn't a huge fan of Mike Francesa, so he let us have at his  locker for a while.  Opened up his locker and we drank his wine and smoked his cigars.  God, but look at this.  This chick is just...  Oh, we're doing What's in My Pants live there.  Oh, right.  Okay.  She's rubbing the microphone on her pussy.  Right.  But she's not facing the crowd.  No.  And then the crowd had to guess what she was sporting.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Just more naked girls. 
[00:45:30]  The venue changed, but it was always naked girls.  Fuck.  We can't get any of this done now.  No.  But also, I look back over some of the naked photos that girls sent me, and some of them  were terrible and small, because back then it would all be through IM, and now you look  at the quality of pictures you get, and it's like 50 cunt shots, and back then it was  just like, ooh, look at her tits hanging out with a teeny pixelated photo.  Oh, man.  Oh, the website's under heavy load.  If you stop standing on it, it's crashing.  The website's crashing now.  The website's crashing. 
[00:46:00]  So, I mean, every time we mention OA photos on Twitter, of course, it's going to be a  problem, so wait until later on, and then go there.  What, did Obama put this website up?  Get it?  Get it, health care.  I apologize.  Yeah, I can't get off this.  Yeah, Obama apologized for people losing their policies, not for lying.  Give me the picture of Blind Matt with his eyeball popped out.  I want to tweet that.  Okay.  There's a gallery I wanted to show you, but...  Which one?  You can explain it still.  You had... 
[00:46:30]  Oh, maybe...  There's Taz.  We just did this.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, the fat girl.  Oh, the fat girl.  Double dong.  Mindy and fucking the redhead girl.  It was fat girls...  It's under heavy load, all right?  Yeah.  Can't you just click on the individuals?  Yeah, you can just do that.  It's...  We had fat girls double dong dildo day.  Is that the day...  Look at her big red pussy.  Tony Danza stopped in.  Really?  If my Tony Danza picture, that's what I'm wearing.  That awful blue shirt. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  We probably just...  I wear five shirts at this point.  I really gotta go shopping.  Oh, God.  Ass to ass fat chicks with a double dong dildo linking them together.  What were they called?  The...  Pigs?  No, no, they had...  Oh, yeah.  And then this...  And then go up to that.  This guy is massively famous now.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  He was on our show.  I don't have a recollection of talking about it.  Yes?  Yes.  Yep.  From 2001.  Wow.  From Third Rock, right? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And then he went away for, I don't know, ten years, and now he's a big fucking movie star.  Came back as a leading man, as they say.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I'm...  Oh, yeah.  Sandy Kane looking exactly the same.  He's looking awful.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Twato.  Oh, wow.  You get a picture of the famous Twato.  Twato.  The growth that's off the side of her vagina.  It looks like an ear.  I'm going to put where I almost don't want to fuck her.  Oh, God. 
[00:48:00]  Ted Nugent.  It's a Nuge.  Oh, this one's great, too.  What is this?  You tarred and feathered a girl in studio.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember this one.  We dumped honey on her.  This is what I totally remember.  Maybe we could tar and feather like Patty or somebody.  Oh, boy.  Why am I behind another girl?  We covered up her areas with wow stickers, and then we dumped honey all over her naked body.  And then we had fans, remember?  Yeah, and we had feathers.  And then we just dropped the feathers in front of these big, huge industrial fans.  And then the feathers stuck to her. 
[00:48:30]  Why did we do this?  Would you like that, Ant?  Just because you like that.  Oh, it would drive me nuts.  I remember it drove me nuts watching this girl getting coated in honey because I hate  sticky stuff for you, Garrett.  But look, she's pretty much covered now in feathers.  She's like a big chicken.  But we didn't need a reason to do anything.  No, that's just it.  We're like, hey, all right, this week, why don't we just tar and feather a girl?  It would be kind of fun.  Would it be fun to dump honey on a naked girl and then feathers all over her?  Yeah.  Okay, let's do it. 
[00:49:00]  Well, these guys have been around a long time, and Eric's asking me questions this morning.  I'm like, wow, that's right.  You just weren't part of this at all.  No.  And I'm like, do you remember during the week we would build the Friday show?  Yes.  Like, someone would call and go, hey, and people knew that we were doing these big, over-the-top  Friday shows.  A Friday didn't go by without just ridiculous shit going on.  Some wacky event.  So someone would call and go, hey, man, you know, a chick, let's say.  She goes, I could smoke cigarettes from my vagina.  Oh, really?  I'm like, okay, we're going to have you in Friday.  And then slowly, but surely, it would build.  A guy would call and go, hey, I'm the lead singer of a midget band. 
[00:49:30]  All right, come on in.  Come on in Friday.  And then it just developed into this crazy-ass show almost every Friday.  And by the time Friday arrived, yeah, we had this big event going on.  I wonder if we could bring that back in some way.  It's impossible.  It is, right?  It's a whole other fucking-  What can we do?  It's crazy.  There's nothing we can do in here.  Yeah.  We're going to have toast.  But maybe we can sign a waiver.  But I don't want to totally give up.  Maybe we could try.  But remember, and then every Friday, it was just a freak show. 
[00:50:00]  Was that Al Snow?  Dude, that's 13 years ago.  Al Snow, Jay Moores.  Al Snow was a fun guest.  Yeah, he was cool.  We liked Al Snow.  Is he still alive?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Is he doing it still?  He's all right?  We haven't heard from him in years.  I see him at conventions all the time, and I always introduce myself, and he always tells  me the exact same story about the time he was on the show.  Right.  It was all-  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  Nikki Sterling.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  And she's holding the wiffle ball bat.  Nice push.  She is really hot. 
[00:50:30]  Nice legs.  And the wiffle bat has some marks on it, doesn't it?  Wow.  Damn, that's a deep one up top.  And look, it has marks on both ends.  It's got the ass end.  I think that was the ass end, right?  Yeah.  We used one end for the ass, and the other end for the pussy.  What the fuck?  We literally were shouting a wiffle ball bat into a girl's twat.  Yeah, and see how deep we could put it.  And then it finally got to a point where if it went any deeper, we were going to-  Oh, yeah.  And the mummy shot that I still don't- I don't remember why. 
[00:51:00]  Why is there a mummy in the room?  We got a legend in studio, Rodney Dangerfield, and then there's a girl just completely covered  in toilet paper.  Oh, we wrapped her.  And then we- We wrapped her.  We tore out the tits.  Right.  Okay, look at those.  The hole where the tits and pussy is.  Yeah.  Hey, huh?  And once again, there was no reason.  We just said, fuck it.  Let's do that.  Yeah.  God.  So it's OA photos on Twitter.  And Eric, what?  A couple times a month you're kind of updating it?  Wow.  I've been doing it.  Who is that?  You had-  Those are the shock girls.  What do you mean, who are those? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, right.  That was at the end of our run, by the way.  I've got to explain this.  Yeah, see, now we're into the 2002.  This is where things got so out of hand, it was just a matter of time before we were going  to get fired.  It was a runaway train, and we all knew it, because we couldn't stop ourselves.  I didn't know it.  And this was before Sex for Sam.  Ken Stevens actually started begging us, you guys got to calm down, because on Fridays  we started bringing in alcohol for everybody.  Bartenders.  And bartenders and shot-  Those were the shot girls.  Shot girls.  They weren't the bartenders.  Their whole job is to walk around with trays of Jell-O shots. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  It's on that girl.  Yeah, she came in-  They're just fucking-  She started coming in on a regular basis.  They're mixing up mojitos.  Yeah.  With fucking no tops on.  Right.  Does it make you feel better, though, because you know all those girls are a lot older now?  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, yeah.  We were out of fucking control.  We were out of fucking control.  Oh, I knew it was just a matter of time before we got fired.  Fantastically out of control.  I didn't know that.  Of course.  I didn't want to know.  Look at everything that was going on. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And the events were getting bigger and bigger, and more out of control, and we were getting  the mayor's attention.  Of course.  I didn't see it happening.  But I don't think we knew-  Wow.  Jim Florentine.  Is that young Florentine?  Wow.  At the Vanderbilt.  Vanderbilt.  Yeah, we did a few gigs over there.  Rich Voss looks exactly the same.  Voss just never changes.  Fuck him.  12 years.  He looks exactly like he does today.  Dumb.  Dumb.  Mini Kiss.  Oh, Mini Kiss.  Yeah, they were really cool guys.  Mini Kiss.  Musical Dildos.  Yeah.  Musical Dildos. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I remember Musical Dildos.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And you know, we didn't want them-  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  Before we move on to that picture, I gotta say, with Musical Dildos, I remember that one  because not only do they, you know, you know how fucking Musical Chairs goes, obviously,  but we checked every girl after the music stopped to make sure that the dildo was where  it was supposed to be.  Was in there.  Or they were getting disqualified.  Yeah.  And I think we had, like, some good money on that one or something.  Wow.  That was crazy.  We would just, like, set up mics outside the studio.  We had so much room out there. 
[00:53:30]  And just fucking, you know, broadcast the debauchery.  Yeah, we had room out there and the ability to run mics out there and stuff.  It was-  And now we're in just a shitty, tiny little studio.  Remember commercial breaks?  We used to go outside.  Go foosball.  Out into the thing.  Play foosball.  Drink and smoke fucking cigarettes.  It was just-  And no one was allowed in our section.  No.  Because HR was starting to take hold of companies.  Yeah.  But they decided if they put a huge sign up that you might see nudity if you go past  this door, then everything's okay. 
[00:54:00]  Fuck.  Just crazy smoking.  Popping fucking Sam Adams.  With all the adjustments we've had to make, how the fuck are we still doing this?  I don't know.  It just amazes me.  That is fucking crazy.  I mean, this photo's great.  It's like he's shoving a pitchfork into hay.  That is, yeah.  With a wiffle ball back.  That is a-  He's spearing a pig.  Yeah.  He's just shoving a wiffle bat up a girl's pussy, and it's right there.  There isn't anything left to the imagination right there.  I encourage people to send in their photos from the old days to Eric, because you guys 
[00:54:30]  might have some different pictures that we just don't have.  What were you doing at this point, Iraq?  Were you with Scott and Todd, maybe?  No.  Were you the sex bagel Eric Nagel?  I was-  Taking your boat to school in Florida?  What were you doing?  I was at WLIR.  WLIR.  L-I-R.  What's that?  Oh, it was a rock station on Long Island.  Oh.  L-I-R.  That was a cool station.  Laszlo was over there, too, right?  Mm-hmm.  Back in the day.  Man.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  All right.  So, uh, there you go. 
[00:55:00]  On Twitter, it's OAphotos.  A little trip down Mamory Lane.  Ho, ho, ho.  And it doesn't do it justice, because it's mostly classic OAphotos.  For now, yeah.  For now.  But, yeah, I guess we'll update it with other shit.  Once I'm done with 2002, we'll start with XM and everything else.  Jesus.  There's a lot to go.  You guys started doing a lot of contests.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Sam, stop trying to eat away with the girls.  Girl's beautiful.  Yeah, she's cute.  Compared to what we've been looking at.  She's like a six, but, you know, when you're in two towns, she's higher than a six, man. 
[00:55:30]  That's pretty good.  What's that?  What is that?  Puke Fest.  That's fish eyes in a cup.  Oh, puke.  Oh, I remember this.  Puke Fest.  We should be the name of the show.  Yeah.  Ah!  We had Puke Fest.  Someone ate a fish eyeball out of Sandy Kane's armpit.  Yeah, a real fish eyeball, by the way.  And other places.  Yeah.  Oh, and her pussy.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Ah!  And there's pictures of us at BCN in Boston.  Looked like Rocky's eye before Mickey cut it.  Do you know how bad your pussy is when someone eats a fish eye out of it? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  And the fish eye is the pleasant part?  Do we have a picture from the people eating puke for Super Bowl tickets?  I have photos.  That's probably...  I haven't gotten to that yet.  That's probably my number one.  Oh, my God.  That day was...  Tracy Lourdes?  Tracy Lourdes was before.  Those were the XFL cheerleaders.  Oh, that's...  The gallery before was Tracy Lourdes.  What did we say?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, gallery before.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we had a younger Tracy Lourdes in.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  She was still grammar school.  So, I'm going through contests that you used to do.  So, you had Team Week, MILF Contest, Ass Contest.  There's a lot of galleries.  We had every body part represented.  Right.  This is craziness.  Stephanie McMahon before her boob job.  All right.  If you ever see that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we told her not to get a boob job, remember?  And she goes, oh, guys, I would never do that.  And she gets giant ones.  She used to be a pal.  She used to come in all the time, Stephanie McMahon.  Jesus Christ.  I was constantly. 
[00:57:00]  She was beautiful.  If you notice in the pictures, I was constantly profusely sweating.  I was.  Look.  Every picture.  I was fucking drunk every day.  Holy fuck.  It was a lot of stuff to recycle around your end of the studio.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Let's put it in terms of today, okay?  Eric, so you understand.  We had an office with three.  It started with one.  We had three refrigerators.  Two were for beer. 
[00:57:30]  We had beer drop-offs on a regular basis from clients.  It looked like a bar where they would, you know, the back door would open and people would  hand truck in cases of beer.  They would hand truck.  And then we would talk about Budweiser on the air.  And so then Sam Adams was like, well, fuck that.  And so they would bring in their Sam Adams.  And then there was a third.  I'm trying to remember what the third beer was that we got on a regular basis.  Heineken?  I want to say it was Heineken.  You saw Heineken and some of the pictures?  I think we did Heineken spots.  There's some office shops up on here where you see all the fridges and stacks of the cases. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, we did.  I think it might have been Heineken.  We did Heineken.  That sounds familiar.  And it didn't...  Like, we would drink during the show, a few of us.  And then after the show, we'd all go back to the office and fucking just, like, hit the booze.  Oh, yeah.  And just sit around laughing for hours sometimes.  We started leaving work a lot later.  Oh, it would be 10 at night and we're still hanging out. 
[00:58:30]  We had a broadcast...  Fucking drinking with Stinky and everything.  We broadcasted till 7.  Yeah.  And some nights we wouldn't go home till about 10.  Yeah.  Can you imagine us doing that now?  We could if we go to afternoon.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  January 1st.  It was a different time.  It was a different fucking time.  Teen Warrior bus.  All right, well...  I remember that day.  That was awful.  Go there if you haven't, you know, and start following OA photos as Eric continues putting photos up there.  Who?  What was that? 
[00:59:00]  Girl sucking another girl's toes.  A girl sucking toes.  Stinky's toes.  Stinky's toes.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God I didn't say what a nice foot.  Jesus Christ.  I think 10 years from now, we're looking back at photos from here.  Like, remember that little studio?  Yeah, look, there's another guy talking.  There's another guy talking.  Yeah, look.  There's a girl with a winter coat on.  Great.  It was just, you know, by Friday, Friday's shows were so easy and so much fun.  We?  That's Knife Girl.  We saw hundreds of naked girls. 
[00:59:30]  Jackie the Knife Girl.  That was...  Yeah, I'm seeing this.  Superstice.  Hundreds of naked girls were on our show.  Really terrible.  Literally.  It's crazy.  Yeah, Jackie the Knife Girl.  I'm only halfway through 2001.  I still have a year and a half to go.  People would just come on up with their Halloween costumes and we would give out, you know, prizes  for the cool ones.  That was stupid Patty and her Superman.  Well, she had to wear a wig because of her head being shaved. 
[01:00:00]  Bikini softball.  That was a fun fucking...  Yeah, that was ridiculous.  Yeah, I gave a shit about the game, which...  There's Jay Moore.  Jay Bullis.  You benched me.  I benched you?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Opie took the game a little more seriously than my dugout.  Oh, you're the worst.  Yeah, when we first started playing.  You're the worst.  You made me wait to come out and play.  No.  I swear you did.  Oh, no.  I think you were mad at me because I was late coming down.  You picked me up on the way. 
[01:00:30]  But you...  Like, I got there.  Oh, no.  And the fucking show...  I'm so glad you forgot about it.  I did until this.  I did until this.  And the game...  I'm watching...  I'm in the dugout watching people play.  And I'm like, what am I doing here?  And you're like, I'll put you in a little later.  Oh, my God.  I feel like an idiot.  Oh, no.  I have my awful fucking shoes on.  Oh.  Hello!  He was waving to the crowd.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  I know you're here for us and not the naked girls. 
[01:01:00]  6,000 people.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was fucking nice.  It was 6,000 people.  They couldn't believe it.  And there was just fucking in the stands.  Just tits and fucking...  Just all sorts of debauchery.  Yeah.  It was fun.  I benched you.  To start the game.  Not to...  Did you play?  Yeah, but you made me wait to go in a few innings.  Jesus.  Wow.  I guess I really was an asshole.  I guess I gotta fucking own up to that. 
[01:01:30]  I like saying it was, though.  It makes me feel good.  I still have my shirt for that day.  The uniform.  I do, too.  Yeah, yeah.  We did that, what, twice?  Maybe three times?  Once.  No.  I did it once.  I think you did it twice.  I think we did at least one other.  Oh, maybe.  I think we did.  The psychos was our team.  Or your team.  Oh, no kidding.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  The psychos.  And what was your dance team?  It was all based on our...  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  I bet it had something to do with drinking.  This girl was underage.  And everyone lost their minds because she...  Was that Taylor?  Um, she really wanted some, some, you know...  Teen week.  Oh, my God.  They're just making out.  Yeah, these girls are, like, 17 tops.  Yeah, yeah.  We did.  We used to do teen week.  We'd just have girls come in.  And they just allowed it.  That we're teens.  But they don't...  It had to be already teen, though.  That was a very big deal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I had... 
[01:02:30]  I just said that.  I don't know.  I just said that.  Yeah, because they all had a sign.  Fucking shit.  So teen week from 2000.  That's 13 years ago.  So these girls are now 30, 31.  What?  32.  Yeah, dude.  That's so fucking...  Oh, my God.  Yep.  What happened?  Yep.  But they were teens.  Amazing.  Just a banner at our bikini softball that says,  the big yellow one is the sun.  Yeah, there were all the sayings that were up there. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, I remember her.  Shannon Love.  Yeah, I remember Shannon.  It's like we're just going through our photo albums.  Gina Lynn is still...  She came to my book signing.  She's from Philly.  I remember her husband were on...  Remember her and her husband were talking about Caber Jet?  She was awesome.  Irving Plaza.  His dick wouldn't get soft.  Right.  All right.  All right, anyway.  That's fun.  OA Photos on Twitter.  Start following that account.  Eric will keep updating it.  I have an announcement.  You do?  It's a big one.  Oh, man.  My website is up now and running, jimnorton.com.  Happy with it? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  It's not finished yet.  We're still working on video pages and emailing lists and all that shit.  But I have tickets going on sale today for Las Vegas, the 27th and 29th,  and New Year's Eve in San Diego.  Nice.  So you can get links from jimnorton.com under Tours.  And I took Colin Quinn's suggestion.  So every time you refresh the page, there's a different album cover.  That's hilarious.  With your face.  That's great.  Yeah.  With some of the characters and all that shit.  That's a great idea. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And Coke Logic did a lot of the fucking...  It came out really good.  Gee.  That is good.  So go there for tickets.  So 10 a.m.  All these tickets go on sale.  Oh, that's the Nevada one's the best.  Never mind.  And it's Jimmy's face on the baby and it's got a giant cock.  Yay.  Yay.  Yeah.  Sometimes the same one refreshes.  But there's probably like 10 or 12 different ones.  And sometimes, yeah, three times in a row, the fucking same one will come up. 
[01:04:30]  It drives me crazy.  That's funny, man.  And I asked Coke Logic to animate Fez's animal beards.  Oh, my God.  Which is probably going to cause a problem today.  Yeah, for you.  But I can't help it.  When Fez has those...  Why a problem?  When Fez has those...  Those moments.  ...incredibly awkward brain fart moments, I love it.  I hear he was upset about that.  Yeah, you guys don't need to worry about it.  What do you mean he was upset about it?  You guys, it's not your fault.  Oh, good.  He's upset that we... 
[01:05:00]  No, not we.  Don't say we.  Why?  Using the completely wrong pronoun.  Really?  Because there's one bully who's responsible for all of his problems that have ever happened  on this channel.  Sam Roberts.  Yes.  Yeah, obvious.  We all know that.  It's always Sam.  Why are you surprised?  As Fez said, the Richie Incognito of SiriusXM.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Except with Sam, it's incognito.  But he says when his asshole is full.  No surprise there.  So either go to my YouTube channel, OP Radio, or E-Rock, put it on our Facebook page, but 
[01:05:30]  CokeLogic did another great...  Oh, my God.  That is funny.  Wait to...  I'm just seeing...  I mean, it works great as a radio bit, but the animation, it's simple but fucking brilliant  at the same fucking time.  And don't forget the subtleties.  CokeLogic on Twitter, by the way, and CokeLogic.com for more animations.  Subtleties.  Read the mic flag.  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[01:06:00]  I believe a lion has a beard.  I think that mane goes into sideburns and stuff.  Look at his eyes.  So I think that would be another animal that falls into the beard category.  Or at least some sort of 70s hairdo where it's kind of...  It looks blown-dried and with the big mutton chops.  But it is an animal with facial hair. 
[01:06:30]  This is so funny.  I don't think it's part of the goat family.  And even though it's not hair, I would say the turkey looks like it has a beard.  With that red stuff that just hangs down below it.  Below its chin.  Below its beak.  So that's all I was going to say.  Then zoom in.  Look how pain...  That was all I had. 
[01:07:00]  Blinking.  The blinking is great.  But watch.  It comes back for a second.  This is Todd.  Fez was here for a little bit.  And then things started going wrong.  And Todd chased him right out the door.  Oh, man.  Isn't that great?  Fucking Coke Logic has a talent.  Oh, that's so funny.  There's not a lot going on in that animation.  No, no.  But it fucking completely works.  The pained eyebrows on the animated face. 
[01:07:30]  And the blinking is so perfect.  It's amazing.  It's great.  Go check it out.  Iraq will put it on our Facebook page, which is Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Nice.  Let's talk about Rob Ford next.  Oh, yeah.  And the Jay-Z.  The Jay-Z.  A Rob Ford video.  We got it, obviously.  We've got to replace some of that.  His ramblings.  He rules.  Fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking rules.  Oh, yeah.  He might be better than Wiener.  Canada finally coming to the table with their fucking crazy ass out-of-control politician. 
[01:08:00]  But how do you beat Wiener?  Bike.  Fucking.  Oh, I get it.  I've always wondered if you ever expand on a story with no intention of it going anywhere 
[01:08:30]  but your own satisfaction.  I'll give you an example.  I was watching Pulp Fiction.  Of course, Zed is laying on the floor bleeding from the crotch.  And he is ready to have some serious shit put down on him.  Did you ever expand upon what happens to him after Butch leaves and the hard pipe-hitting  niggas do show up?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you ever dwell on that yourself?  Do you ever do that?  Oh, well, no.  I usually ask myself certain questions about... 
[01:09:00]  I actually think the movie keeps on going on after the scene stops.  Exactly.  Absolutely.  I mean, in that case, I didn't take it out to the complete scenario of exactly what they  did for the next 90 minutes or three hours or whatever and how they disposed of the body  or how many different pieces the body was in when they weren't finished.  But, you know, it did involve pliers and a blowtorch.  Right, yeah, yeah.  And you can only imagine.  What Anthony's telling you is that he puts a ball in his own mouth and whacks off thinking 
[01:09:30]  about being bent over a sawhorse.  Oh, and that, by the way, that's another thing that I've always been curious about, and you  rarely get the chance to speak to the guy.  I noticed with the ball gags, Bruce Willis had his a lot further in his mouth than Ving  did.  Did Ving have a gagging problem?  Because it really was much further out in his mouth.  I didn't really clap that, I have to say.  I will check that out next time.

[01:12:30]  And now back to  The O.B. and Anthony Show  On Sirius XM 
[01:13:00]  42 years ago today  Led Zeppelin 4  Zoso  Was released  40 years  42  42  I was never into  Zeppelin when it was like 
[01:13:30]  Out  When it first came like  Out  I can't believe that  I was such a little faggot  When it came to  Hot music back in  The day  Like my brother was  Pretty cool  Right  He would listen to some  Pretty progressive shit  And rock and stuff  And I would have to  Secretly tune in like  PLJ  Back then to  You know  Listen to like  Faggy music  And stuff  To get your AC  Yeah yeah 
[01:14:00]  Adult contemporary  That's why it was a good  Driving  Driving somewhere with mom  In the car  Because I knew like  She'd put on the  Faggity music  And I'd be able to  Listen to you know  Little Elton John  And Kiki D  My sister was  Six years  Is  Excuse me  Jesus  Six years older than me  So what was coming from  Her room was like  The Tony Orlando  And Dawn  The  I don't know  The Beatles  And like the AM  Station stuff  Afternoon Delight 
[01:14:30]  Yeah all that crap  For real  Yeah  No rock bands  For the most part  Although she went to  A BTO show  And got the drumstick  Once  Oh nice  That was a big deal  In our family  For a long time  She would display  The drumstick  In her room  Was it BTO  I'm going to have to  Ask my brothers now  I think it was  I think it was  Bachman Turner Overdrive  And then they threw  A stick into the audience  She got it  She had it forever  I guarantee she has it  To this day  Bob used to call it  Bachman Turner Overdrive  On BAB  Yeah  So then 
[01:15:00]  My friends finally  Started introducing me  To rock  And it was  It was weird  Then it was  You're going to kill me  For the first one  It was the Bay City Rollers  Not saying rock rock  Right  But you could see  The transition here  Then it was Kiss  Like Jimmy  Then it was Black Sabbath  I was all in with Black Sabbath  Oh man  But then when I was  Introduced to  Led Zeppelin for real  That was it  I blew off everything else  For a long time  I was all in with Zeppelin  The Who was my  Yeah the Who was a biggie  My point where 
[01:15:30]  I veered off  From the  Pussy music  Right  And went to rock  Yeah  But then my friend  Rob DeStassi  Which I mentioned  I mentioned him recently  We ended up throwing rocks  At his mom  Because we thought  She was a witch  But then I became friends  With Rob DeStassi  Craig Bench was convinced  That she was a witch  So we'd throw rocks  At her while she  We rake the leaves  Well you have to  He turned me on to  Like I said  Jethro Tull  Which is weird  Because that seems like  A band where you really  Need a little more taste  So it's kind of like  Zeppelin and Jethro Tull 
[01:16:00]  At first  Yeah yeah  And then Led Zeppelin 4  Was everything to me  But then I realized  There's way better  Fucking songs  Than on other albums  Yeah  I veered off into  A southern rock thing  That Charlie Daniels  Outlaws  Molly Hatchett  Charlie Daniels  Because of the one song  That was on AM radio  No no  We had gone a little  We had gone much deeper  Than that  By the time  Devil Went Down to Georgia  Came out  We had already been  Listening to Daniels  For a while  I had no clue  I just knew that one 
[01:16:30]  Fucking song  For a really long time  And of course  Yeah yeah  Things like  Blue Oyster Cult  And yeah yeah  And then I fell into  That whole rock thing  But before that  I was all about  Fucking you know  AM radio  The Carpenters  Oh my god  I can't even look at you  I'm not kidding  The Captain and Tennille  Oh yeah  Douche  Yeah total douche  Yeah  I was kind of there too  To be honest with you  For the most part  Yeah  Cause this is what was  Coming from my sister's room  All this shit 
[01:17:00]  Yeah yeah  This was on the car radio  She was recovering from  You know  Recovering from some  Some issues  She was having with my mom  Let's just put it that way  She had her sanctity  Her room  With this playing  And like  Is this going  Why doesn't mommy hit us  You can hear how thin  Karen Carpenter is  Right  A thin voice  From her thin body  This would be like 
[01:17:30]  Yeah  Carpenter's always  Depressed the shit out of me  Obviously  A lot of talent there  But I didn't want to go  That fucking dark  I just feel darkness  When I listen to their shit  Now the Captain and Tenille  Was a lot more fun  Yeah  Upbeat  That was the more  Upbeat kind of music  What was their big song  What was the Captain and Tenille  Puppy love  No  Muskrat love  Puppy love I said  Muskrat love  That was terrible  That wasn't like their big hit

[01:46:30]  Now  We're up to our long distance dedication  And this one is about kids and pets  And a situation that we can all understand  Whether we have kids or pets or neither  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio  And here's what he writes  Dear Casey  This may seem to be a strange dedication request  But I'm quite sincere  And it'll mean a lot if you play it  Recently there was a death in our family 
[01:47:00]  He was a little dog named Snuggles  But he was most certainly a part of  Let's go start again  From coming out of the record  Play the record okay  Please  See when you come out of those up-tempo god damn numbers man  It's impossible to make those transitions  And then you gotta go into somebody dying  You know they do this to me all the time  I don't know what the hell they do it for  But god damn it  If we can't come out of a slow record  I don't understand it  Is Don on the phone? 
[01:47:30]  Okay  I want a god damn concerted effort  To come out of a record  That isn't a fucking up-tempo record  Every time I do a god damn death dedication  Now make it  And I also want to know  What happened to the pictures  I was supposed to see this week  Since the last god damn time  I want somebody to use his fucking brain  To not come out of a god damn record  That's up-tempo  And I gotta talk about a fucking dog dying  The O.P. and Anthony Show  On Sirius XM 
[01:48:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Continues  We got a big star on the line  What?  Colin Quinn  Oh  Colin  Hi guys  Well Bobo called earlier  And he wants to really talk about this road trip  He's convinced that it's going down  Yeah I mean  I'm doing Unconstitutional  In New Hampshire  Massachusetts  Albany 
[01:48:30]  Next week  I'm promoting that  And then  I'm going out with Danny Boy  And Lynn Feller  To  I think our first stop  Is Motel 6  In  Pennsylvania  I mean  Bobo's come up with some pretty good ideas  So far  Oh  She sure has  What are some of the ideas?  Well he says  We should  We pick a guest in each city  Somebody we know  And then we put him on the show  That's not a bad idea  That's fantastic  It's a terrific idea  Yeah  You know  And then the other idea is  I mean  The only problem is 
[01:49:00]  He's got a little power man  Like for example  Yesterday  He offered fucking Bill Burr  On the tour  Without even consulting  Oh my god  He didn't consult you  And he wants to bring Bill Burr on board  I look at Twitter  He's like  Bill Burr  If you want to join me and Colin  On our tour  It's like  Well  Can we discuss it please?  Right  You ever say this  Don't you Colin?  Yeah  Unless I heard him on the radio  And like  Spell in love with him  That jolt  That was probably on a roll  You're not going to get Bill Burr  On your stupid tour  Oh  Oh no 
[01:49:30]  Well I know who we are going to get  Chip  Fuck yeah  I'll do some jokes  Yeah  Well yeah  Chip would be a perfect addition to this tour  Oh god  Because guess what  To me  It'll be like  Relatively new and fresh  To Chip  It's a period and culmination  Colin  Hold on a minute  I got very good news  Who's here?  What?  Bobo  You're on with Colin Quinn  What? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  I'm actually here on the phone  Bobo  Jesus  Why don't you two hash out some of the  Yeah please  The things  We'd like to hear you spitball this thing right here on the show  Yeah  Get an inside look  Bobo  You invited  I was saying about these  I was saying about these  You have to be  You have to be very circumcised  You know  You have to be judicious  With how  How  That doesn't mean what you think it means  How  How you lay these out  Like you invited some young girl  Yesterday  So Lynn Belli  Got a little pissed about that 
[01:50:30]  I noticed  Uh oh  I wasn't pissed  No she was like  Look  Everyone's welcome  I just  She was taking my surprise too  And then I heard the Bill Burr news  You know me and Burr  You know  There's a lot  It's like the Cobra and the Mongos  Why did you invite Bill Burr Bobo?  Without asking Colin Quinn  Yeah without asking Colin  Well  If he's okay with it  But you didn't say that  You didn't say if Colin's okay with it  You just invited him  You're not getting Bill Burr  Oh boy  All right 
[01:51:00]  Shit  I forgot to say that part  Ah you forgot  What about Chip  What  Bobo what about  What about Chip Chipperson  Will you invite him  Chip's always invited to be  One of the guest stars  In the road trip  Oh nice  All right  So good  We do agree artistically  I was worried  Artistically yes  Now  More important Bobo  And this is uncomfortable  For me and for you  And especially for these guys  Yeah  Me and Bobo  Talked on Twitter  With our followers  We do need a little 
[01:51:30]  Financial backing  Oh  How much  How much money  You think  We racked our brains  And we came up with you guys  Oh so we're supposed  To finance this  Yes  Support the tour  Yep  How much money  You think it's going to be Bob's  Well I don't know  Well I do know  Ballpark  Ballpark  Ballpark  Ballpark  How much  I'm not  I'm not even sure  Come on  You gotta know  Yeah this is your  How much money  Just come up with a figure  How much do you think  You piece of garbage  I don't know  It's going to be in the thousands 
[01:52:00]  In the thousands  How many thousand  Are you right about that  I don't know  Ten  Ten thousand  Ten thousand bucks  Ten thousand  Bobo  You're underselling  Right  He's negotiating  For both of you  Carl  Yeah  Jesus Carl  Yeah  Bill Burr doesn't do two minutes  Bill Burr wouldn't even go on  Conan  If it's under ten  Right  You're not getting  Fucking Bill Burr  For your stupid tour  We already lost him 
[01:52:30]  To be honest  Yeah yeah  Wow this is a  This is going to be a great  Great tour  However Bob Kelly  Rich Voss are still available  From now up until  New Year's Eve  Carl you're doing  Unconstitutional  In Massachusetts  Yeah I'm kind of  Paving the way  I'm doing it in Massachusetts  New Hampshire  New York  Kind of paving the way  For you know  For the next  The real tour  The Danny Boy  Oh yeah  Well of course 
[01:53:00]  Yes  Of course  They're going to love it up there  They're you know  The whole  I think it's right in their wheelhouse  It's right in their wheelhouse  Right in their wheelhouse  Freedom Trail  All that shit  Yeah  Yeah  They got a Ben Franklin dude  That walks around up there  Right  Or is that Philly  That's Philly  Oh yeah Philly's got the Ben Franklin  Alcoholic dude  Remember how bad he smelled  Yeah  Oh did he reek  Boston's got your  Your Paul Revere  Yeah you got the Paul Revere thing  Shit like that  That's our bike path  Lexington and Concord  Right  Concord, Lexington 
[01:53:30]  Site of many battles  Sure  Let me just incorporate  What if we did like a  Historical American tour  Wow  I thought it was good  I thought me and Bobo  Was going to be more like  On the road  Like Neil Cassidy  And Jack Kerouac  Uh huh  Yeah  Now I'm starting to think  Maybe it's going to be more  Of like an American historical  Like you know  A Lewis and Clark maybe thing  That'd be kind of great  You know  Gettysburg  And the Alamo  Sure  You just hit up 
[01:54:00]  All these historic places  Across this grand nation of ours  Well you know  But Bobo's the brains behind this  So let's ask Bobo  Yeah I like that  And it also could be a big bit  Of a multimedia event  Like how Bobo  Like I actually  Yeah  Like I could actually be calling in  Over the course of the trip  And then there could be  Video updates on how the trip's going  Because it does  It does take more to the day  So there'd be video updates on it 
[01:54:30]  And there'd be maybe  Maybe certain locations  Stop for the  On a tour  There'd be  Me and Colin  With broadcasts from  And maybe link up to the show  Oh wow  Broadcasts link up to the show  That's exciting  That sounds pretty good  And there'd be  And there'd be  And there'd be a news launch party  Right from  Let's say  From McFadden  Next door to Citi Field  Let's say  Let's say  The bar that I go to  Right  Bobo 
[01:55:00]  Yeah we have  We'd launch the party from there  Bobo  Bobo  Who's going to walk Mr. Malonegan's  When you're  Gallivanting across the country  With Mr. Quinn  Very good question  My mother and my sister  Will be taking care of the dogs  Oh man  I'll be walking them  Alright  They're in good hands  With my mother  How many dogs you got  Not that I care  Two dogs  What you got a fucking  What's that  A beagle and a schnoodle  Schnoodle  A beagle and a schnoodle  Well this sounds great 
[01:55:30]  So you need like  10,000 or 20,000 dollars  No no  Bobo please  Yeah Bobo's  10,000 seems very reasonable  Undercutting Colin over here  What  Bobo  Well I'm just saying  We want to have our own  Bobo  We don't have our own hotel rooms  Well let me ask Bobo though  Bobo if we give you the 10,000  You guys will handle  Your own expenses though right  Well  Well  Well  Well maybe there might be  One part of the road trip  But not 
[01:56:00]  Not every time  The entire trip  Like the reason  There's going to be  Multiple people  Is like  Let's say maybe  One  People could take turns  Doing the driving  Yeah  That's a good point  So you guys  You guys are literally  Going to drive yourselves  Like  Like Colin's going to have  Some wheel time  For a while  And Bobo  Does Bobo get wheel time  And then Bobo  Sit there and go  Colin you okay  You feel okay  You want me to take over  And then  Now Bobo  You don't even have  A driver's license 
[01:56:30]  At this point  No he doesn't  Well by the time  It'll happen  I'll have a driver's license  But do you think  You'll be ready  To drive across  The country  Without any practice  So far in driving  Well  By that time  I'll have had  A bit of experience  Because by the time  Because it's  It's very  In a few weeks  Bobo  You need years  You need years  Of practical experience  Driving an automobile  To you know  Encounter all the  Various dangers  And things 
[01:57:00]  You'll encounter  Weather changes  On a trip  Across the country  You're willing  To take Colin's life  Into your hands  Like that  Yeah well  You've got to remember  Where I'm learning  To drive  In the process  I'm learning to drive  In very heavy traffic areas  But that's just it  There's not much traffic  When you drive  Cross country  It's a lot of  Open highway  High speeds  You know  You've got to  Kind of stay awake  For that  And look out for things  You probably should go 
[01:57:30]  And practice on the  Autobahn for a little while  Maybe yeah yeah  To get money  For the  American highway system  Someone told me  He said  If you're learning  To drive in heavy traffic areas  Like Flushing  You're covered  Oh you're covered  As long as you practice  In Flushing  You're set for the rest  Of the country  I didn't say just Flushing  I mean  Right  Well there's a lot of Asians  In Flushing too  And if you could drive  Around there  Without fucking losing your mind  There's some weird logic  In what he just said  By the way  Of course  If you can handle 
[01:58:00]  Flushing  You know  He's not far off  And Colin  You'd be okay  With somebody  That just got his license  Like Bobo  Driving you  Across country  Well I don't know  Where they get  I want to  First of all  Tell me where  They get the road test  Out there  If it's on one of those  Like you know  On that hospital street  No  If it's on John Bowne  Or on Main Street  Then yes  Right right  You need something  Like Queens Boulevard  Utopia  Yeah exactly  Yeah yeah  And Chip Bobo  What about Ditmar Avenue  How's that for the driver's test 
[01:58:30]  Ditmar  Bobo  You've got to remember  It's not just me  That's doing a drive  I said  If the people  That are joining us  Want to  Want to  Help us  I ain't fucking  Driving nowhere  Oh Chip won't drive  Fuck that  How many people  Are you going to  Squeeze in this  What is it  A car  A minivan  A minivan  So you'll be  In a minivan  Colin  And you  And how many 
[01:59:00]  Other people  Are you thinking  Well my friend  Well my friend  Timmy  Your friend  Timmy  Carl you've got to  Go with Timmy  Carl you're going  To be with Bobo  And Timmy  And Timmy  This is the first  I've been hearing about this  You guys really  Got to get together  And get your  Chemistry back  Cause  They're going to  Help us  Who's Timmy  Bobo  He's a good  Friend of mine  And what is  I've met him  I've known him  Since you guys  Did that  Show out

[02:00:00]  Oh a trade  Have you started  Calling up car dealerships  Yeah  Bubz  Well the thing is  I don't know how to  Pick car dealerships  That I'm calling  On behalf of  Well I think  With a conversation  Like the one  You've been having  With us  It's perfect  Yeah I think  You're doing  A pretty good job  Call  Call  Oh not Sam  Or E-Rock  Should make the calls  Yeah I think  Let's say I call  That annoying  Manfredi car dealership  That keeps  African  You can't call them  Annoying if you  Want something from them  Manfredi  Right  I don't mean 
[02:00:30]  Annoying  But I'm saying  I hear that  Commercial  Freaking  Anytime  Anytime  I hear one of  My favorite teams  And I'm listening  On the radio  If I happen to be  On the radio  That moment  That they seem  To put that  Commercial a lot  Oh my dear  Sweet Jesus Christ  On a cross  Alright well  This is great  I'm gonna  Okay  What  When you're ready  To go on a road trip  Yep  Sure  Okay  I get it  Uh huh

[02:01:30]  Colin's feelings  Bobo  I mean  I heard the name  I went talking about  Yeah  Not Timmy  But I think Bobo  Was a little upset too  Because he got  Froze out of that  Show the other night  By Bobby and Norton  Uh oh  What happened  He surprised  What happened  He made a surprise  Stop at a sold out  Show that I was doing  I got there  Off the train  And I did  Two tweets  That are like  I'm outside  I can't get in  I was like  I think it was a joke  They let him in  Of course  Oh my god  They go there  He left

[02:23:00]  When news happens you see it happen on Channel 7  The number one station for news and information in Southern California  Now  Paul Moyer  And Martin  Johnny Mountainweather  And Todd Donahoe Sports  This is Eyewitness News Tonight  Three men dead tonight in an execution style murder in Los Angeles  Good evening  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there  You'll be there 
[02:23:30]  Continues  Well here comes the letdown  Everyone hung in there for Lady Di  And of course she's not on the phone  She hangs up  I'm thinking though  And now it's going to be impossible to get her back  She can call back though  She might not have been able to play the voicemails while she was actively on the phone  And she probably  Well that's a logical answer  But I'm sure it's something  Ridiculous  Right  So I don't know  We'll get her hopefully back on to play some of those voicemails 
[02:24:00]  Maybe  Damn  Rob Ford in Toronto  Oh yes  The crazy mayor of Toronto  Becoming the greatest politician of all time  Very quickly  Surpassing I believe Anthony Weiner almost  Yeah this guy's out of control  Out of control  Now there's a video of him basically  I guess he's explaining the video by saying he was really wasted in that one  And he's basically threatening someone's life who wants to kill somebody  He's very embarrassed by it he said  And now the press up there 
[02:24:30]  They're scrambling  They're trying to figure out who he wants to kill  And when is this tape from?  Around the same time period as the crack one or what?  Yeah I guess it's within the last year or so  This guy if you watch the video  The way he's parading back and forth  And twitching  And he's all jittery  This is a guy on crack  That is a guy on fucking crack right there  That isn't just drunk  Yeah  Like he says  In your humble opinion  Uh no 
[02:25:00]  He's on crack right there  Jesus  You're very irresponsible today  That is such a fucking  He's tweaking  Yeah let's hear this  Caught on camera  Toronto's mayor Rob Ford  Oh look at his legs all shaking and shit  I mean language  No  He dies right  I don't even know  Brother you've never seen  Get a good copy of this fucking thing  Is there a better copy?

[02:27:00]  De Blasio  De Blasio  Run around like a nut  Right  What would Bloomberg be saying  I'm going to take his potted plants  And re-soil them  I'm going to take all of his soda  And put diets in his place  Give me 10 minutes  With the large soda salesman  I love this guy  Rob Ford  Did he have a press conference on this one yet?  Yes he did  Because his press conferences are the best  He did  He did  He's very  He said there's a very embarrassing tape 
[02:27:30]  Oh boy  He's apologizing  Or a highlight from the press conference  He is so  And I think he's explaining  That he was really drunk for this one too, right?  Yeah  It's  That's more than  Admit to being really drunk  That's more than drunk right there  Donald Starr just released a video  That I was  Very, very  Inhebrated  And  Who are you talking to? 
[02:28:00]  Sounds like  Sounds like Lady Di's phone  It's choking up  Right?  For you  All I can say is  Again  Again  Again I've made mistakes  These  All I can do is  Reassure the people  Well that's  What won't happen again?  I don't know what to say 
[02:28:30]  I just wanted to come out  I wanted  So you know  Look at him  No Mr. Bond  I expect you to die  Well you know what  I just wanted to come out  And tell you  That  I saw a video  Look at the flop  Oh yeah  It's  Extremely embarrassing  Yes it is  I love this guy  You know what  I don't have a problem with that  Yes you do  It's extremely embarrassing  Please  And I don't know what to say

Rob Ford  For Prime Minister  For Prime Minister  Or will ever be  In that state  And that's all I can say  It's uh  Obviously  I was  Extremely  Extremely  Inebriated  Inebriated  Okay 
[02:29:30]  So  Again and again  That's all I have to say for now  And then we're  I mean  How great  The mayor of Toronto  I love it  Holy fuck  And he acts like he's a victim  Right  He's like oh this is really  Oh yeah  What  So embarrassing  He's talking about killing somebody  Fucking cracked out of his head  Talking about killing somebody  It's amazing  He won't step down  They're saying today  He wants to go for re-election actually  He's like I ain't fucking leaving  So what happens now 
[02:30:00]  It's my game  How do they get him out  He'll step down  How  The pressure will mount  Right now he's still like  He's dazed  He will  Like the guy in San Diego  Right  He will absolutely  It'll take some time  Oh yeah of course  Yeah  Have you been keeping up  On what a circus  His office is  There have been wrestlers  Showing up  Outside of his office  Why  Just to cut promos  It's like the Iron Sheik  Showed up  In Toronto  Oh my god  Outside of his office  To challenge him  To an arm wrestling match  Do we have that video  Yes

[02:34:00]  Was like you can't  Come into city hall  With giant barber scissors  But they use those  To do ribbon cutting  Ceremonies the mayor  True  So it's no worse  Than that  We should have  Bring out his own scissors  We should have  Went up there  Oh yeah  And done a big thing  Let's do it  With the mayor  Challenge him to a kiss off  Let's leave right now  Let's go  Let's see this thing  This is Brutus  This is Brutus  The barber beefcake  Yeah  Barber  Remember he would always  Threaten to cut  People's hair  Right  I don't know why  All these wrestlers  Are up in Toronto  Right now  Well there's no heat here

[02:36:00]  God now we need to know  Who's gonna show up today  It really shows you  What the difference is  Between the United States  And Canada  Like there  They're just with  The guy shows up  With giant scissors  They don't even take him  They just tell him  Hey put that away  Put that away  Right  Not to  Over here  You gotta put that away  Here  Where he'd be wrestled  To the ground  And fucking  And dragged off  After a sound thrashing  He'd be on a watch list  Forever  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Oh my god  This is great  He brought a deadly weapon  To the mayor's office 
[02:36:30]  He had to be subdued  Beefcake  Comma Brutus  Hey can we  Do some Jay-Z stuff  Before barbecue day  Yeah  Like some predictions  Maybe  Fishman's thinking  The honky-tonk man  Is gonna show up  Challenging him  To a guitar hero play  That would be cool  The honky-tonk man  I don't know  I mean my money  Would be on Coco Beware  Coco Beware  Yeah  He's gonna do  The Coco Beware dance  Yeah just flapping his wings  Flap his little wings  Like that  Yeah  Man  What about macho man 
[02:37:00]  Randy Savage  I can guarantee you  He won't be there  Well how do you know  Well he's deceased  Oh shit  What did that happen  Oh shit  He's no longer  Macho man Randy Savage  What about the British Bulldog  He could show up  And  I'm getting this weird  Deja vu thing going  What  Yeah he's also  Oh man  He is  That doesn't sound right  Okay  I understand  You know who should go there  And bust him  Who's that  Maybe a law enforcement officer 
[02:37:30]  Fuck yeah  The big boss man  The big boss man  Generally speaking  Oh yeah  From fucking  Where is he from  Macon  Macon County  Cobb County  Cobb County  Nice  Yeah I remember  It was in the song  That's what I remember  Number one  His jurisdiction  Is only in the United States  Okay  And number two  He's dead  Ah  Well when is the service  Going to be  Damn it  Years ago  What  Yeah he died  Several years ago  Oh man  Several  What about  You know what 
[02:38:00]  You could prove that  Nobody's  Perfect  By maybe sending in  Mr. Perfect  Okay I mean his son is a possibility  What  Mr. Perfect's son  But Mr. Perfect no  Because he's  Well he's dead  What  Mr. Perfect is no longer with us  Oh man  He died at the perfect age  Of somewhere in his  Probably early 40s  Oh my god  This is terrible  Mr. Perfect turned out to be  Not so perfect  Believe us  He turned out to be 
[02:38:30]  A bit flawed  That name is  Soaked in irony  Yes it is  Let's move on to  The Daily Show  Yeah  Because they did a great  Little rant on the  Jay-Z situation  With Macy  Sexy it up with  Miss Elizabeth  She's dead  Shit  Are the trucks  Pulling up to  Actually Barney's  Is the trucks  Pulling up to Barney's  So Jay-Z can get all his  Shit out of there  To show his support  For the black man  Well how come  Sharpton didn't threaten  To protest Jay-Z 
[02:39:00]  The way they threatened  To protest advertisers  Who do things  They don't like  Because he's black  Of course  But I'm saying  That's again  Why you can never  Honor and respect  The ideology  It's a lie  And Jay-Z's making  The Rev look  Kind of stupid  Because now the Rev  Doesn't have a leg  To stand on  If the Jay-Z's  Not all in  With this  Boycott thing  I think Jay-Z's  Official comment  On the boycott  Has been  Awe  And then hell  With  Hell  Nah  Yeah  Several E's  Eddie Guerrero  And then not 
[02:39:30]  Eddie Guerrero  Is no longer with us  Chris Benoit  Well he  Not only is he dead  But he killed  His entire family  Jesus Christ  Murder suicide  One of the worst  Things  Believe it  Which was a giant  News story  I thought you would  Have known that  Well it's so giant  He never existed  Trying to push  That's how big that one was  Yeah  He never existed  We don't say that name  For him hanging in there though  It shows he's got a lot of heart  Wouldn't it be nice  Don't say it  What  I hope you're going to say Brett  I was thinking Owen  Yeah man  He's Canadian too right 
[02:40:00]  Of course  Well he was Canadian  What  Why was  Well in the late 90's  He fell to his death  After a wrestling stunt  Went wrong  Jesus Christ  I bet you they had to  Shut down the event  Because that's crazy  Yeah  No  If you saw that live  The show can't go on  After that  Obviously  Didn't go on  After that right  They didn't  They didn't do the match  Oh I see  They went right to  Their next match  Was there a huge  Bloodstain in the  No  That's what I heard  We heard bloodstains  I watched the pay-per-view  They couldn't get the  Bloodstains out of  There was no fucking 
[02:40:30]  Bloodstain  Oh well  So Jay-Z  Jay-Z  Forever now  Jig-A-Man  Bonnie's  Young Hove  And well  The Daily Show  Brilliantly  Kind of pointing out  That Jay-Z's a bit  Of a hypocrite  Uh huh  A bit of a hypocrite  Because you know  He's a hypocrite  Because there's too much  Money at stake  Of course  It's all about the cash  We're going to pick it up  From this point  You think  Yeah  The funniest part  Was when they  Sent it off to their  Black correspondent 
[02:41:00]  Oh  You know what  I only heard the audio  Of this  Yeah  They  What's wrong  They had to keep it safe  Why  They had the black guy  Making all the fucking  They know  Jay-Z slash black jokes  Christ  They know  Wow  And they didn't pick him  Because he was the best  Guy for this segment  They picked him  Because he was black  Now I'm so bummed  Well you'd get in trouble  If you do that  Any other way  If you got a black correspondent  Then he could say anything  But why  He could say anything 
[02:41:30]  Because they don't want  It's not though  It doesn't make any difference  They don't want to get in trouble  For their humor  That's what it is  Oh Christ  There's a couple things  Going on here now  Jimmy knows what I'm talking about  A hundred percent  A black correspondent  Could be great  Or maybe do the job  Perfectly well  Right  But that's not why  He was chosen  That's not why  In a racially charged story  He was chosen  They're protecting themselves  Oh Christ  Because I swear  I heard the audio  Of this  And there's some funny shit  In here  Yeah  Let's see what he says  Whatever  Let's make my point 
[02:42:00]  Go  For more  We're joined by  Senior black correspondent  Mr. Larry Wilmore  Larry  That's senior black correspondent  How funny  I even had to say that  Yeah  J.G. doesn't care about black people  Alright  That makes sense  It's funny if a black guy says  I'm Mike Myers in this conversation 
[02:42:30]  Aren't I  Oh God  Let me finish John  He doesn't care about black people  Who want him to boycott Barneys  And I don't blame him John  But isn't this an outrage  If black people are being stopped  And frisked  While shopping  Well  Shop and frisk  Is what the media calls it John  Brothers just call it shopping  You know  And by the way  Make it for your mind America  You can't tell brothers  To pull up our pants  Then arrest us  When we try to buy a belt  That's fucking  That's funny  It's a good line 
[02:43:00]  It's a good line  I see why they use this guy  You know what  It makes sense  Wouldn't it be helpful  For Jay-Z  To take a stand then  Why  John  What do you think  Jay-Z is  Al Sharpton  With better rhymes  He's got a multi-million dollar  Brand to protect  You're saying to me  If I may  If I may  He's not a businessman  He's a business  Man  Yes  Well wrapped  John  Look 
[02:43:30]  These days  Jay-Z's too big  A commercial force  To rail against  The danger  Of the man  He is the danger  He is the one  Who frisks  He's not Jay-Z  He's Jay-Z Penny  Or  Jay-Z Morgan Chase  Or Jay-Z Penny  Like I said  Right  I know Jay-Z used to be  A groundbreaking rapper  But then he turned 40  Now he's a rapper  Who shows up 
[02:44:00]  At groundbreaking  Oh Jesus  Holy crap  Is that  Can I see that again  What  Oh my god  What's he doing there  With Merit Bloomberg  And his shovel  And he's bearing the remains  Of his street cred  It's tough  But  John  This is a moment  To celebrate  Now in what way  Well John  Because it means  We're catching up 
[02:44:30]  White people  Have been watching  Their musical icons  Sell out to corporations  For decades  It's the American dream  And we're finally  Achieving it  You go  Jay-Z Penny  Yeah right  Hey John  It's not like  He's the only  Hip-hop star  Swapping his Glock  For stock  50 Cent  He made  100 million  Off his sugar water  Dr. Dre earned  A quarter billion  For his headphones  Business  Have you seen  Ice Cube's  Beer commercials  He's selling  Coors  In the Rocky Mountains  It used to be 
[02:45:00]  N*** with attitude  Now it's  N*** with altitude  Pause  Did edgy  Comedy Central  Just beep him  Saying n***as  Yes  They did  Even on the web  This is their  Web player  This is the web version  How can we  Isn't that ridiculous  Yeah that's  Let's bleep that  That's offensive  And I got tricked  I gotta say  I got tricked too  Because I didn't  See the whole bit  I heard excerpts 
[02:45:30]  Right  Which really made it  Sound like it  Was a white guy  Possibly saying  All this shit  I wonder if that  Was sort of  Purposely done  Problem  Oh they bleeped  Out n***as  Yeah of course  It's what it's called  N***as with attitude  It's  Smart edgy humor  Can't even say  The name of the record  Even though black guys  Name the record  Like the biography channel  Yes  Bleeped Pryor's  Bicentennial n***ar  And that n***ar's crazy  That's what a comic genius  Called his record 
[02:46:00]  Right  And these fucking  Corporate white faggots  And I guarantee you  It's white people  Make the decision  That the n-word  Can't be said  In any context  Even if it's said  By such a great  Comic mind  And a true  Social statement  Yeah yeah  Bicentennial n***ar  Is a horribly  Sarcastic  Social statement  Uh huh  That he's making  But bicentennial  Doesn't mean anything  Yeah  Fucking stinks  And for what?  Like what are they 
[02:46:30]  Trying to protect there?  Who would protest that?  Who would protest  Somebody accurately  Saying the name  Yeah  That a black artist  Gave his record  We sound like  A broken record  I know  We really do  But it keeps coming up  I'm not blaming you  Jimmy  But we sound like  A broken record  Because no one gets it  Yeah  It's amazing  It's just basic knowledge  They're criticizing  Jay-Z  For being inconsistent  With racial stuff  Right  And then they do  Racial jokes  And they fucking  Beep n***as 
[02:47:00]  Yeah  And it's not  It's not  The Daily Show people  By the way  This is a Viacom decision  This is not  Jon Stewart  And this guy  Then don't use  That joke  Don't use the joke  You're gonna do the joke  But you're gonna  Bleep out that word  That's crazy  Yeah  You know  Then do a workaround  But this is  This is what  An emasculated  Fucking country  We are with humor  Yep  Like Jay-Z can say  Whatever he wants  He's sticking with  A company that has  Behaved racially  And that's fine  You're calling him out  You quote the name  Of a black record 
[02:47:30]  And they beep you  They beep it  Holy shit  Is there a double standard  In music and humor  Oh  Yes  This is what makes you  Fucking sick  Uh  Hold on  I know they beep rap lyrics  Hold on though  Let's go to Nick in New Jersey  Hi Nick  Yeah  When that weird live  They didn't beep it  But when  I guess for the web  They beeped it  Which makes even less sense  For whatever reason  They beeped it  It's beeped  In what should be  An uncensored arena  Uh huh  And it's not even  A gratuitous  Nasty 
[02:48:00]  No  Uh  Comment  He didn't say something  He didn't accuse  He called somebody that  What an embarrassing  Fucking  Yeah  Nation  Same country  That gets mad at that girl  For uh  For having her tit grabbed  By her boyfriend  But we're a progressive country  Real progressive  Hip Americans  Fucking embarrassing  Twats we all are  An embarrassing  Stuck in the 50's  Uh  Era of twats  Yes  Puritanical  Should we uh

[03:17:30]  And then you swing through  To plant your feet in front of you  And then you do a dip  And then you swing back  Into a plank thing  And then do a push-up  They were fucking horrendous  Oh my god  Yes  You know what I hate?  The girls  Burpees  Oh, yeah  I don't like burpees either  They have cooties  Yeah, the burpees  And then you do something like  Alright, you gotta do  Fucking 20 burpees  20 push-ups  And then  Fucking squats  And then  And then when you get done  You do it again 
[03:18:00]  And again  And that boot camp shit  It made me throw up  And you're fucking  Just exhausted  I gotta breathe in between  Sometimes those fucking things  Man, I get crazy  I have to breathe, yeah  I sweat like a fucking monster  It's just  It's insane  But then when it's done  I sit down on the couch  And just go  Ah  Well, you've earned that  And I play with Little Beavis  What, did you do an hour?  I didn't see Little Beavis  A little over an hour  I haven't seen Little Beavis  Last night  Because I did Red Eye last night  So I stayed in the city  And he was all alone  I was just picturing him 
[03:18:30]  Like swatting at his little toys  And knowing there to play with him  I felt kind of bad  He's probably fine  I felt a little bad  I forgot you were alive  The minute you backed out of the driveway  Yeah  He's just not sure  He just wonders  Why is that fucking  Why there's not a glass  Being tipped back  Magically in the air  Yeah  He doesn't know your name  He doesn't relate to you  He would eat you quickly  If you died in the house  Yeah  Well, because he'd be hungry  No, within minutes  Yeah  I mean  You think within like minutes

No, I let him mosey around the house now  That's good  He's  Sure, he didn't piss on anything  Yeah  No, he doesn't  He's perfect when it comes to  Perfect  His  Perfect  He doesn't do that anymore  He did it twice  When he was a little, little kitten  On like the tile floor  I want to put treats  On the fucking wires  I want to smear like cat food  On the wire  So he chews through it 
[03:19:30]  He zaps himself  No, he's little beave  Leave him alone  We'll have an open wire  By some fucking  By some liquid  And then put a little treat  Beyond it  Why would you say that?  It'd just be funny  But he's so adorable  I know  And fun  No  You watch a fucking TV  It flickers  Like when someone gets  The electric chair  Yeah, you just  The lights dim  You're watching all of a sudden  It's like  What happened?

[03:20:30]  And you go  And it's resistance  On your arms  No, because the thing  Might open  And I'd be flown out  To my death  Not the side door  The cockpit door  So I was implying  That you'd get in trouble  Because they  That's frowned upon now  All right  I like this  I like that you're  Feeling guilty  That you ate a piece of cake  Yeah  As opposed to the fact  That Lady Di is still  Sitting in her living room  Taking calls  From O&A listeners  I felt bad  Beep  Beep  Beep  Shit  What are you kidding?  She loves it

[03:23:00]  Was put up with  Those incessant  Horrible jokes  You know what it reminded me of  And Iraq  You'll probably remember this  When  Pap from Munaki  First started coming to the show  And he would come in  And he would do  Just joke after joke  After joke  And get car crash  After car crash  After car crash  Yeah cause we weren't used to it  Yeah  And then  Yeah  Then we fell in love with the guy  And we understood it  And now you expect Pat to do that  But  And now it's hilarious  It's a whole different deal  But  This guy's not turning into that  They're feeding shade 45 now  Yeah  Oh boy 
[03:23:30]  Roland you're the birthday boy  Yeah  What I didn't like  Was that nobody  Made reference to the fact  That you walked in here  With a GoPro camera  Strapped to your head  Or that I had to expense  My own cake  Why  Well  Yeah you had to expense  Your own cake  But you insisted on that  No  I'll order it  Well yeah  If you're  Somebody else  Will order a cake for you  But if you're gonna insist  On ordering it  Then yeah  Nobody's gonna  Just hand you cash  They should  I mean  That's your idea  That somebody  Would just hand you  Like here's some cash  Order your own cake  Yeah 
[03:24:00]  I pay for all your cakes  For your birthdays  Right but we didn't pick them  We trusted other people  To do that  Yeah  You see the difference  Yorick's buzzed  No  I'm watching him  Sell his stuff to Sway  Is he a little buzzed  Has he had a Bloody Mary or two  I think he had  Yorick you had to  Help yourself to a Bloody Mary  I had two of them  I had two of them  He's feeling  He's sitting down  He's pulling the chair out  He had to see  It was so  It was so funny  The way he sat down  On his chair before  He was like  Like kind of fell into it  Yorick  Yorick's usual vibe  Is like 
[03:24:30]  He doesn't say anything  He just sits there  It's like  Half lazy  And half depression  You know  I just don't want anything  To do with this anymore  But he gets a couple  Drinks in them  He's the best  And he's ready  To have a little fun  You all remember  Tequila in a donut day  Yeah  Let me  Look at me  Yeah you're feeling it  A little bit  I'm good  I know you are  That's the point  I had two  Bacon Bloody Marys  And two pork sandwiches  That's the point  That pork didn't absorb

[03:34:00]  Awesome job  On Oliver Stone  No that's not a bad thing  I just don't like  The whole  Sal had an issue  Sal had a big issue  The other day  We went down  To a restaurant  That's here in the building  And we were waiting  Online to get our food  It was a quick service  Restaurant  Quick service  Counter service  I don't know  I watched that  America's Next Great Restaurant  And they had some weird name  Quick counter service  Something like that  And  QRS  What does that stand for  Do you know  Counter service  Counter starts with AC  Counter starts with AC 
[03:34:30]  Don't watch your story  Okay  So  They  We were waiting  Online to get our food  And some guy  Comes up to me  And he goes  Hey Sam  Just wanted to say  I really like your work  And for some reason  That bothered Sal  Who are the ladies here  Hi  Hi  Hits1 interns  Welcome ladies  Come on in  Roland we got some chicks  Here for your  Well that's for Rob

[03:35:30]  Bloody Marys to the interns  Oh that's right  You're an intern boss  I'm sorry  They're not our interns  So  You're right  Well I mean  You want cake then  I guess Roland's not sharing  His pork with you  No  I'm actually good  I might actually try  A bite of the cake  Try some of the cake  It's delicious  Roland why aren't you  Wearing your GoPro  On your head anymore  Because it died  It did  Yeah  It filled up  Thank god  I was going numb  On my head  Roland was walking around  With a GoPro  On his head today  Because the web team  Thought it would be  A good idea  To document his birthday  I think the web team 
[03:36:00]  Should stick to  Technical things  Not ideas  I don't know  I liked you  Walking around  With a GoPro  Stretched to your head  All day  It did  So Sal  Why did you have  Such a problem  Some guy comes up to me  I don't know  He tells me  Thank you for stopping by ladies  Sam  Sam you liked this even more  When you were gone  To screening  Hook  He goes  I'm going to buy you guys  Some food downstairs  Look who's here Roland  Rob Cross is here  Rob  E-Rock  Enjoy the Bloody Mary  Yourself  No I'm good  Rob I've been  10 years  Pork  Souse  That's what I'm saying  For the last 45 minutes 
[03:36:30]  I'm glad somebody  Picked up on this  Oh damn man  It smells like meat  And liquor in the hallway  Yeah that's Eric  I want you to know Rob  We had girls come in here  Just now  And they weren't just any girls  They were Hits 1 interns  And what people don't know  About Hits 1 interns  Is when ugly girls  Come in and say  I'd like to be an intern  They get immediately  Put on the Pay No Mind list  None of them are hired  They really do go  Top shelf  At Hits 1  Exactly  They only bring in  Cute girls  And so these two  Hits 1 interns 
[03:37:00]  And that's why  When we say  Roland  These are Hits 1 interns  We all know  What that means  And they come in  And I go  Ladies  Welcome to the party  I didn't think  We were going to have  Any ladies here  Help yourself  To some cake  And some pork  Roland goes  No no not the pork  That's for Rob  Come on  I go  There are young  Good looking women in here  Why are you saving  The pork for Rob  I seriously want you  To give the pork  To those ladies  At least Rob  I mean that  Literally  Hell yeah  At least Rob  Will digest it  They'll probably vomit it 
[03:37:30]  No no  They're not  What the hell  Does that mean  Roland just is  Friendzoning them  So hard  No he's not even  Friendzoning it  He just implied  They're bulimic  How is that even  Why are you being rude  I can't even eat this  Pork in good conscience  Knowing that it was  Meant for his one  Interns  It was  But Rob  I want you to have it  I think Roland  The birthday boy  Yes  Roland really wants you  To have it  Where's the sauce  The sauce  Oh man  I can't go sauce  Right now  It's too early  Nah  I had like  Strawberry yogurt  Like not very long  Hey Rob  I can't reverse like this 
[03:38:00]  Just guess up your office  Rob  It's 12 o'clock somewhere  Oh holy shit  That's good barbecue  See  That's why we put up  With that idiot  Telling those horrible jokes  For so long  Because the pork is delicious  Sam yesterday  When we were downstairs  The guy goes  I'm a big fan of yours  All of yours  And they go  Hey you can you picture  And they give the camera to Sal  Sal you don't like  Seeing other people  Get recognized for their achievements  Oh no no that was fine  It was just the way  The guy was like  Fawning over you  And then he sits right next to us  Creepily like  He was enjoying his meal 
[03:38:30]  It was a little weird dude  That guy was a little weird  And looking at his hero  Enjoy his meal  Sam Roberts  It was just the way  He was just so  Oh my god  Sam  Look  Such a fan  Sal  I want you to know  Yeah  There are people who admire  What I do in this world  I know  I understand  A lot of people  And so it's like  One of those things  And this is something  That maybe I should have  Cleared with you  Before we went out  And it's something  That I gotta clear  With people a lot  I think I had this  Conversation with Rob  Not too long ago  If you wanna hang out  With me  The fans are a part  Of my life  You know  Where else have you  Been recognized recently 
[03:39:00]  And that's  I get recognized all the time  Bro  Yeah where  Where  On the street  Okay  I go to any wrestling shit  You're the man  I'm like  Clooney  Okay  I am the man  At any of these  Wrestling conventions  Right  The Rock Center Wendy's  Yeah the fucking Wendy's  But maybe that's just  Because we hit on the  Cashiers  Yeah that might be  What that is  But I have gotten  Recognized in that Wendy's  I get recognized  All over the place  This is a giant radio show  I know  I know  It's just  And I've been with you  When you've gotten  Recognized before  That's what I'm saying 
[03:39:30]  But it's just that  One particular guy  Was just ready to  Get on his knees  And fucking  Suck your dick  He was so happy to see you  I want you to know something Sal  There is an army of people out there  Who are willing to jump on a knife for me  At a moment's notice  We got another lady  And Roland's not even here anymore  He left his own birthday party  Happy birthday  You can talk into this  Yeah but he's not  Yeah that's the microphone  I know you're just an intern  I don't know if I want to be on you  Hits1  You just figured you'd talk off mic  Hits1 doesn't teach their interns  Roland  Thanks for the meat boys  Happy birthday Roland 
[03:40:00]  Roland another Hits1 intern is here  Yes  So you take half cake  Go ahead  You want some pork  No  Roland can she have some pork  Yeah  But that's because she said no already  Yeah  You son of a bitch  What's Hits1 teaching you  Hits1 is teaching me everything I need to know  Like what  That Mikey Piff dresses like Duran Duran  Okay Mikey Piff is the program director I guess  Over there  Oh so you are the morning mashup intern  I am the morning mashup intern  Does that make you  Push that mic over closer to her Roland 
[03:40:30]  She's got her hands full of cake  Does that make you the top intern at Hits1  Do we classify top interns  I think so  I mean if there's  If you're a Hits1 intern  If you could be a Hits1 intern  Or a morning mashup intern  I would think the Hits1 intern  Is the higher profile internship  Wouldn't you  I think you just made it backwards  I think the morning mashup intern  Would be  Higher rank intern  Did I say it opposite  You said it opposite  I'm not good at this  I'm not good with words  I know  So you're the morning mashup intern  I'm the morning mashup intern  Which makes you 
[03:41:00]  The top intern  Right  Is that intimidating for you?  Do the other interns resent you?  Sometimes  How come they didn't get to be the morning mashup interns?  What made you so special?  That I cannot answer  You don't know  I think it's all just a look at the draw  What's the morning mashup really teaching you?  Like what is  Do they need an intern?  Like what are they doing over there?  The morning mashup is very self-sufficient  Well yeah they're just playing the Hits  Well the thing is  Right  They do a lot of work  But they do a lot of work on their own too  They're great  They're great  Who does a lot of work on that show?  Your best friend Nicole  She does a lot 
[03:41:30]  Yeah she does a lot of work when she's in here with me  Because I put her to work  But what do you mean she does a lot of work?  What does Nicole do?  On a daily basis  Nicole does a lot of research  She does a lot of things  A lot of research?  Research what?  Where do you think we get all this 411 information from?  TMZ  She just goes to TMZ and reads it  Alright what do the rest of them do?  Anything?  There's 4 of them  Rich is  Wild child Rich  Okay  Right before the show starts  Bam bam bam 
[03:42:00]  Does it all  But he's on it  So he doesn't need to be there early  His mind can be elsewhere  But he is on that board  Okay and that's Rich  You need him because he is a machine on that board  He is a machine  What about the other 2 girls?  Okay  The other 2 girls  My 2 besties  Right  We got Ryan  Ryan  He knows everything  Why doesn't he say it on the air?  Because he knows  He does  He has all these theories  Everyone goes against his theories  But he's got them  Okay but so he doesn't know everything  He just makes some shit up a lot  No he knows a lot too  A lot of random things  Things you wouldn't understand 
[03:42:30]  He comes from a small town  So he gets the  We're in the city right now  But he knows the other side  Uh huh  What's the other  You're talking about like  Is that a  Like a racial  Because I would think Stan would have the other side covered  Stan has all sides covered  Yeah what does Stan do then  Stan he's in charge of the birthdays  You know he's got the big black sack  He knows it all  So he's a black guy with  Are you talking about his testicles?  A big black sack  You should listen to our show maybe  No I work on another morning show actually  I'm aware but  Yeah yeah  I think you need to know about the big black sack  Maybe you could come in and 
[03:43:00]  His testicles  Oh you come in the big black sack Sam  I don't know if you can with that  Some kind of surgery  Um  I think that's where it comes from isn't it?  That I  Come I mean  You know what I'm saying  I know what you're saying  How's the cake?  I'm just gonna eat cake  How is it?  Is it good?  It's delicious  It just strikes me that the morning mashup  Doesn't seem like they need an intern  However  I'm gonna tell you something  You seem like a great intern  Cause I've never heard anybody sell the morning mashup so well  Oh thank you  It's true  You know what  They do a great job  And I love them 
[03:43:30]  To death  Eric in the other room  He said especially Ryan  Ryan gets a lot of hate  I don't know why  He does the weather  I know  And maybe it's all the fun facts people don't understand  Thanks guys  Thank you very much  My god  She knows when to leave  She comes in here  Why don't we have interns like that?  I'm gonna try to hire her  We have Tyler  That's what I mean  Yeah  Man look at this  The room's filling up  It's a party  Roland you gotta be happy with the turnout  Who are your friends?

[03:45:30]  She wanted to get in contact  With Anthony  Uh she was given  Misinformation  I believe it was a mistake  But Anthony and Jim  Mistakenly told her  That if she puts her phone number  On Twitter  With two periods after it  And at mentions  Anthony Cumia  That it will be  A private tweet  As it turns out  The tweet was anything  But private  Uh and it went  All over the place  We were on the phone  With Lady Di  Our Lady Di  Not the dead British princess  Uh listening to her  Call waiting go off 
[03:46:00]  If you didn't hear it  It was the funniest shit  I've heard all week  So uh check that out  I'm sure it'll be on  Worst of the Week countdown  But Austin  You've been on the phone  With her  Yeah maybe a half hour ago  I told her I was from  Burger King  Um calling her back  About her application  And she said  We learned that  We learned that yesterday  When she was on  The after show  That uh that she  Is looking for a job  And she's recently  Applied to work  At Burger King  She said oh no you're not  I don't appreciate  All these phone calls  So why is she  Picking them up

[03:47:30]  Pump them out almost  Uh huh  With drinks you mean  Uh no no  Pump them out  Well I haven't pumped out  Any interns  Uh recently  Actually I think the phrase  Pumping out  Has been banned  Yeah  From the after show  I think so  Yeah yeah  I'm pretty sure  That's terrible  I think that's on the  Do not say list  I think  Okay  Yeah  So you can  Hand out drinks  Rather  Um to  To interns  From hits one  But  The interns on  Your own show  You can't share drinks with  Well look  What's the haps  The haps is this  The interns on the 
[03:48:00]  Opie and Anthony show  For some reason  We get a bunch of  Creepy dudes  And hits one  Gets cute girls  And that's the way  The world  I'm trying to set up  These people  For what life  Is going to be like  Outside of the workplace  And that's just  That's earth  But what happened  With the darling interns  You never gave them drinks  I mean  Ant sent a car for them  To go to a party  But they never  Were drinking on the air  Well the hits one  Intern said no  So we don't have an issue  What  They said no  How can they be  On hits one  And not drink  To get through

[03:51:00]  Because you wouldn't  I don't even know  He's talking about anymore  Wow thank you Luke  That was great  Tweet to me bud  Doug in Boston  I don't know who he's talking about headphones  Sweetheart  What's up buddy  It's a Friday  It's a casual day  Hall of Famer  How are you pal  Good it's Roland's birthday  We're celebrating  It's a party  Happy birthday Roland  Thank you  My birthday was two days ago actually  Why is there being  Everybody  It's so weird  You know  Everybody who's got any birthday  Within a week of Roland's 
[03:51:30]  Is calling up  And being like  Hey just so everybody knows  I had one two days ago  Because they're only  Happy birthday back  Hey one more thing  It's not fucking cool dude  I don't know  I thought it was alright  Lonnie in North Carolina  Hey Sam  I was just wanting to check with you  And see if you're in  Christmas mode  And like to give away  A pair of beats  I don't have headphones to give away  I'm wearing them  Well somebody  I think  Maybe  Roland's got a pair 
[03:52:00]  Maybe he's wanting to give  A pair away for his birthday  Hey Roland  Can Lonnie have your headphones  Lonnie  What movie are you releasing  Or coming on to show  What to promote  Get the fuck out of here  Alright it's your birthday  Roland  You make the rules  This guy's got some set of balls  To ask the birthday boy  For a gift  Yeah  If you've got a gift  For Roland  You can call it  I give you all gifts  So where's my gift  Huh  I give you all gifts  Of beats  So where's my gift  Cake  It's getting expensed  Mikey Piff is here  Mikey Piff  I'm going to tell you something  You're the program director  For Hits 1 
[03:52:30]  Correct  Something like that  The assist  Something like that  Some official title like that  Whatever  You do the music  For Hits 1  That's correct  See that job I get  Yes  I was trying to get to the bottom  From the intern who came in here  The morning mashups intern  Yeah  Why on earth the morning mashup  Would need an intern  Right  Let me tell you something  About that girl  Which one  She did  The morning mashup intern  Okay  Yes yes okay  She did a better job  Of selling the morning mashup  Than anyone I've ever heard  Kudos to her  Alright  She did a great job  I'm going to have to pull  That tape  Yes  Better than Tommy  Does that mean she gets cake  Or something  She got some cake  You want some cake  So I'm here to wish 
[03:53:00]  Roland a happy birthday  And tell me how much  I appreciate him  As a friend and a co-worker  Roland what's it like  To be loved like this  I don't know  He's like a big huggy bear  That's a very  In-depth response  Eric in Utah  Hey Sam  Are you wearing a wig  Right now  Yeah  No  Well everybody's saying  You're trying to be  Like Howard Stern  Oh I see  I understand  No my hair  My hair is very natural  If I was wearing a wig  It would look a shit ton  Better than this  336 
[03:53:30]  You're on the show  Hey guys  Who's going to pay  For Diane's cell phone  That's a good question  I mean  If  Alright  Here's the question  Lady Di's cell phone number  Got given out today  On Twitter  Technically  She gave it out herself  But it was highly suggested  By Jim and Anthony  Specifically I believe  I think  Jim and Anthony  More than anybody else  That she give out  Her phone number  On Twitter  Is  Lady Di owed  $5,000 in quarters 
[03:54:00]  Birthday boy  I start with you  I say no  She's dumb enough  To give it out  She takes the consequences  She did it herself  That's the difference  Or she should give out  Her other friends  The number  Which one  The retarded Shirley  Or  The retarded Shirley  What's her name  Marion  Yeah  That's right  Together  They're the retarded  Laverne and Shirley  But you assume  That Lady Di  Has to take the role  Of Laverne  Yeah  Okay  She should give her  Number  That's not been funny  But until then  She suffers  Conflict  So she should give out 
[03:54:30]  Retarded Shirley's  Phone number  Correct  Sal  Yes  Does Lady Di  Get $5,000 in quarters  No  Definitely not  But you know  The phone calls  Will probably slow down  I don't think so  After a day  I mean there are  Well over 300 retweets  On her original tweet  No it'll stop  I saw one Twitter user  Who actually changed  His Twitter name  To Lady Di's phone number  Like that's the name  His name on Twitter now  That phone's so fucked  Yeah it's done  So fucked  Eric  I go to you  You're a little buzzed  No I'm fine 
[03:55:00]  But I trust your opinion  Anyway  You're the guy  Who's lived through this  First of all  Lady Di is  We found out  From the listeners  Still taking phone calls  After her number  Was given out  On Twitter earlier today  And the listeners  Caught wind of it  Is there any recovery  From this  Can she wait this thing out  Do you think  Um  No  But she won't realize  That she needs to  Change her phone number  Or do something about it  So she'll just deal with this  For the next several days  Or you think  It'll only be days  Until I guess 
[03:55:30]  Her roommate  Wises up  And says  Hey we gotta do  Something about your phone  But she's not gonna  Figure this out  On her own accord  Somebody will eventually  Tell her  We have to get rid  Of this phone  It's not going to start  That dude or Marion  Somebody's gonna tell her  That we need to  Get you a new phone number  By Marion  Do you mean  The retarded Shirley  Yes  You tell me  Uh huh  You've lived through this  You know the pain  You saw what happened today  Keep in mind  Jim started this mission  Yesterday  On the after show  When he started  Even bringing up  The idea of tweeting  With two periods after it 
[03:56:00]  Uh  Do you think  Lady Di is owed  Five thousand dollars  In quarters  I do not  Why is that  Cause she did it  On her own  Um  Just because a radio show  Tells you to do something  Right  Doesn't make us responsible  Okay  For you going out  And doing that  If  It was found  That this radio show  Was culpable  Who on the show  Should give her  The five thousand dollars  In quarters  If you remember  E-Rock's phone number  Was given out on the air  Uh  Not  With E-Rock's consent  Opie did it by mistake 
[03:56:30]  He let his voicemail play  The voicemail  Had the phone number  E-Rock was awarded  Five thousand dollars  In quarters  For pain and suffering  And a new vacation  Who  On the show  If somebody had to  Uh  Should pay Lady Di  Five thousand dollars  In quarters  If someone had to  I think  This time  Because even though  Jim initiated it  Yesterday  Mm-hmm  He wasn't successful  Mm-hmm  Um  Anthony really  Got her  Motivated to do so  Very interesting  So I think 
[03:57:00]  He would either  Have to do that  Or  Extend her an invite  To his next party  And the tweet was  Directed towards Ant  But you're saying  The five thousand dollars  Could be paid off  Via a simple invitation  To the compound  I think so  By the way  We were talking about  Ant's compound party  Last weekend  Lady Diane Marion  Would be such a hit  Would be such a hit  At the compound  Oh he's got a dinosaur  Yeah  Hey how are you  Velociraptor  I was trying to feed it  Ugh  They're the worst people  In the world  304 you're on the show 
[03:57:30]  She stumbles into the pool  Yeah  What's up buddy  Hello  You're on the air  Oh my  Sorry too late  765 you're on the air  Master broadcaster  Sam  You fooled me  I was gonna call up  And say  Baba Booey  But instead  I'll just say  Baba Boo  Baba Boo  Baba Boo  See  That's totally  Baba Booey  That's totally different  Totally different  239 you're on the show  Hey buddy  Hey I just wanna know  I'm sure your fucking fans 
[03:58:00]  Don't call Howard's show  And bust balls  I mean what kind of  Fucking dick bag  Calls your fucking show  To bitch about  Fucking  I just don't get  These fucking Howard fans  People got a lot of time  You know like  It's not on Friday  So they got nothing to do  I don't  Fucking jizz bags  Fuck all of them  Fuck them all  I don't have time  To do stuff like that  Because I'm too busy  Making something out of my life  A lot of people have free time  And they're listening to your fucking show  They're listening to your show  How many fucking  If your fans go  And listen to Howard  I would say fucking none 
[03:58:30]  Yeah  None  Yeah  Fuck Howard  You guys fucking are the best  Love you guys  Thanks buddy  But you know  I mean I didn't realize  That Howard Stern  And the after show  Had such a beef  I thought that everything  Was copacetic  But 910  Uh Sam  What's up buddy  Now did you  Did you call her  Yeah I called her  I told her  I thought this was  The Obamacare  Help line 
[03:59:00]  That's what I got  Off of Twitter  But she knows  Nothing about  Obamacare  She can't answer  A single fucking question  In my head  What did she say  What did you ask her  I asked her  How I could get  Through your website  I told her  I was on the website  Because she helped me  Through it  She didn't say  I don't know  What you're talking about  She said  I don't know  How to do it  Oh that's great  Thanks buddy  Hey I'm on 
[03:59:30]  The Obamacare website  And I'm trying  To figure this out  And they said  This was the number  To call  Well I'm on my phone  And I just can't  Figure out how  To do it right now  I'm watching the monkeys  The monkeys are on  And I'm already  On my phone  I don't know  How to get  The internet  Because I don't  Have the internet  In my house  Except on my phone  If somebody  Called my phone  And said  I was told  This was the number  To call  For Obamacare  You know what  My response would be  Hang up  You were told wrong  And then I would  Hang up  That would be  The end of the  Conversation 
[04:00:00]  Not  Well I would  Help you out  But I can't  Get on the website  Right now  Her initial inclination  Is to help  You can't  You can't be mad  At somebody  For that  304  You're on the show  Too slow  918  You're on after  Opie and Anthony live  Hello Samuel  How are you  What's up buddy  I got five things  To say in under  Ten seconds  Okay  I have  Hello Slabo  Where the fuck  Is Troy Kwan  Fuck Sal  He's a dick bag  Um  Oh shit
