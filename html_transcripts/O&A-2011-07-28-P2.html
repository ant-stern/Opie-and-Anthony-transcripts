<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a substantial segment dedicated to the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts hosted, conducting numerous interviews throughout the convention.  Norton interviewed Joel McHale (Community), discussing the show's style, McHale's career transition to stand-up, Comic-Con's intense fan culture, Greg Kinnear's acting, and the overwhelming nature of celebrity at the event.  Ken Jeong made a surprise appearance during this interview.  Roberts interviewed Elijah Wood (Wilfred) about promoting the show, its premise, the changing entertainment industry, and the decline of physical media. Wood admitted he wasn't familiar with Jim Norton.  Roberts also spoke with Jason Gann (Wilfred) about bringing the show from Australia, wearing the dog suit at Comic-Con, and the impressive fan-made costumes. Fiona Gubelmann (Wilfred) was interviewed by Roberts, discussing her unique surname, her experience on the show, and the positive fan reception at Comic-Con.  Chip Chipperson conducted crude on-the-floor interviews with attendees, making inappropriate comments about their appearance and costumes.  Roberts also interviewed Bruce Campbell, discussing *Burn Notice*, his long career, and his beloved Comic-Con status, even mentioning his "mayor" title.  Finally, Norton interviewed the Mythbusters team (Cary Byron, Grant Imahara, and Tory Belleci) about their Emmy nominations, the competitiveness of award shows, and Danny's intense admiration for Cary Byron.  The entire Comic-Con segment was punctuated by humorous anecdotes, banter between the hosts, and Chipperson's off-color remarks.

A separate segment featured an interview with Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage of *Mythbusters*.  The conversation started with a discussion of their bizarre experiments, including an unaired flatulence experiment involving underwear, a microphone, and a hydrogen sulfide meter.  They also discussed their Comic-Con appearances, their blue-collar work environment, their rising fame (Hyneman noting his surprise at his celebrity status and first awareness of it being his invitation to the Opie and Anthony show), and a segment with President Obama (where they went to the White House but Obama didn't visit their set).  The interview concluded with playful teasing about a fan, Danny, who intensely admires one of the hosts and has repeatedly tried to get an autograph and visit their workshop.  Norton referenced a previous Comic-Con appearance where he wore sweatpants after visiting San Quentin. The hosts thanked the *Mythbusters* team and wished them luck at the Emmys.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Epic interviews, awkward encounters, and the quest for sweet celebrity photos.  This is Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic Con Adventure 2011.  Oh yes, you betcha. It's me, Sam Roberts, here.  And this is the, what is it called, Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic Con Adventure.  I guess everybody needs a catchy title or whatever that is.  It's the Comic Con show, the show that chronicles the time that Jim Norton and I had at the San Diego Comic Con just last weekend. 
[00:00:30]  Comic Con is just a wonderful place to be.  Jim and I were there last year, and even though, if you don't remember, look it up on YouTube or something,  but if you do, it was a disaster in terms of getting interviews and finding out where to be and everything.  It was a disastrous trip, but being at Comic Con itself was a magical experience,  so magical that we insisted, Jim and I, on going back for another year, and that's what we did. 
[00:01:00]  We were there live, in person, for the 2011 San Diego International Comic Convention.  A lot of people from Sirius were there this year, but guess what?  It was just Jim and me from the virus, so that's what you're stuck with on the Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic Con Adventure.  It's not just comic books anymore, folks.  You probably already know this, but it's everything pop culture.  They have movies and TV and video games and toys and a few comic books. 
[00:01:30]  It's everything your little heart would ever desire in the pop culture world,  and now big celebrities come to these things and do panels and talk to the press.  I mean, it's almost become a giant press junket more than a comic book convention,  but it's everything all rolled into one.  It's a huge event, and Jim and I got to speak to many of those big stars and many of those fans.  You'll hear all that on this Comic Con Adventure show, whatever it's called. 
[00:02:00]  We'll start with an interview that Jim got to do.  As I said, people come from miles around to promote their movies and their television shows.  Community is one of the hottest shows on NBC right now.  Joel McHale is the star.  He's been on the show before.  I'd like to say he's a friend of the show.  In his heart, I know he's a friend of the show,  but it's been a long time since any of us heard from Joel McHale.  We got to catch up with him at Comic Con this year, 
[00:02:30]  and Jim Norton sat down.  Ken Jeong happened to be in the room doing an interview with somebody else  while Norton was interviewing Joel.  So keep your little ears open for that.  This is our Comic Con show.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic Con Adventure 2011.  While we're sitting here with Joel McHale from Community.  Congratulations, man, on how huge the show is.  Thank you, Jim, and thank you for coming all this way. 
[00:03:00]  And I'm so glad this is my – I go on opening Anthony like every other month now.  Sorry, guys.  I'm sorry.  No, no, it's fine, dude.  I have a question about the way they shoot Community,  because a lot of times I'm in the gym and I'll see –  is it shot differently than most shows?  Because the quality of the video looks really –  like it's really different than anything else,  or am I just for some reason seeing that differently?  You're actually – you're absolutely right.  It was a conscious decision when the series first started  to not look like a lot of the comedies on TV,  which a lot of comedies now are shot documentary style, 
[00:03:30]  handheld, real light, and they use a lot of confessionals.  And it's that mockumentary thing.  And we did not want to do that  and to make ourselves look separate from those.  And they wanted to be cinematic.  So that – yeah, you're right.  So they want it to look more like a movie than a documentary.  Are you – do you do stand-up as well?  I do, yes, yes.  Did you start as a stand-up,  or did you start doing stand-up once you began to do well? 
[00:04:00]  I started stand-up after The Soup started.  I started about three years ago,  and because my agent said you can make a lot of money.  Yeah.  And I was like, really?  Let's go do that.  Yeah.  So it has been a trial by fire.  And I think – I don't know.  You know, when you –  you have to go up a thousand times before, you know,  before jokes start working.  But you're used to it, though,  because from doing The Soup,  you're talking about things that are going on.  It's all topical stuff.  It's like – so you probably are pretty good 
[00:04:30]  at writing topical material.  Yes.  There was a lot of wiener jokes when –  a few – a month ago.  But, yeah, The Soup was a strange –  not exact perfect training ground for stand-up.  But, yeah, I mean, it's just me telling jokes  for, you know, 22 minutes every week.  So, yeah, it really, really helped.  Do you go up a lot?  I mean, do you try to go up a few times a week  and do the stand-up?  I try to go up, but with –  like, when now the community's shooting again,  we have really long hours,  and I got two kids,  and I do write jokes, but I –  and so if I know I'm going to be telling some new jokes, 
[00:05:00]  I'll try to go up and tell them.  I'll see how badly they bomb.  But I was in a weird situation  because people were already watching The Soup,  and that's when I kind of started.  So I didn't have to do what –  I didn't have to, you know,  prove myself the way that real comics have had to.  I used to have to be funny, though.  I mean, they'll give you the first five minutes,  but anything after that,  they're not going to give you.  Yeah, I think Charlie Sheen's show  demonstrated that in Detroit.  So, but yeah, no, it was – 
[00:05:30]  yeah, now, I mean,  now I'm much more comfortable doing it.  But as you know, it's –  there's no safety net out there.  No, and I kind of –  I think that's what I like about it,  and as opposed to acting.  And to me, acting is harder  because I can't acknowledge  when something is going wrong when I'm acting.  When I'm doing stand-up,  I can really just blow it up if I'm bombing.  But when you're acting and you're bombing,  it's horrendous.  Yes.  Thank God for editing.  And, yeah, I mean, you've seen Chevy –  no, I'm just kidding.  No, yeah, you're right.  I mean, I –  it's funny because I love the acting so much, 
[00:06:00]  and it's what I very –  well, sometimes not –  I mean, I'm comfortable doing it.  I love doing it.  So, yeah, it's one of those things where,  you know, thank God Community's coming back  for a third season.  Were you a trained actor before you did The Soup?  Did you come up acting,  or did you start, again,  start acting after?  I came up acting.  I went to graduate school for it.  And when you have a degree,  that means you're really good.  No, yeah, that was what I really pursued,  and when I came here, 
[00:06:30]  that's what I came to do.  But I did –  I chose –  I took The Soup because –  because of Greg Kinnear,  the pedigree of that,  and the people that had done that  and then gone on to do acting.  That's why I did it,  because I could not get into  those audition rooms to get,  you know, for parts that I wanted,  or for, like,  you know,  being like a series regular,  I couldn't even get into those rooms.  So I figured The Soup was –  you know, The Soup became  like a half-an-hour audition tape  in a weird way,  and obviously, 
[00:07:00]  I mean, I love doing the show,  but people began to go like,  oh, yeah,  bring that guy in for that thing.  So it really worked out.  Well, Kinnear's a great actor.  I mean,  what did he do with Cuba Gooding  and Jack Nicholson,  as good as it gets, I think,  and what else has he done?  Like,  what was his first breakthrough role?  People were like,  wow, this guy can really act.  Sabrina with Harrison Ford  and, what's her name,  Julie –  oh, she's –  I would kill me if I didn't –  but that was the first –  he got that big role in that,  and then he was –  do you see – 
[00:07:30]  it was the one with Mark Wahlberg  about the Philadelphia Eagles.  He played Dick Vermeule.  No, my friend Dove is in that,  and I'm so passive-aggressive.  I won't watch a guy on my level  who does a movie,  so I didn't watch that.  Oh, I understand that.  It's really good,  but his –  like,  even his dick for a meal  was incredible.  Like, I'm like,  oh my gosh,  he's doing a dick for a meal.  It wasn't an impression.  I'm like,  he can even do that.  But he's worked, like,  consistently enough  for, like,  20 years in the movie, so.  Do you like being a –  I mean,  I guess you enjoy it  because it's good  you do the panel  and stuff like that,  but is this a culture  that you're comfortable with  the way people are here, 
[00:08:00]  or did you have to  kind of get used to it?  No, I mean,  it's a weird thing  to go somewhere  and have people tell you  all day long  that you're great.  I said right,  but this is what a phony –  I said right  like I experienced that.  I imagine that would be irritating.  You're great.  This is why I'm here  to tell you.  No, but it is this thing  where you –  it's weird.  People talk about,  oh, I've got to go to Comic-Con.  I'm like,  you have to go be adored?  Right.  And, okay, good.  I'm sorry  that you have to go through that.  But, you know,  it's one of the –  like, last year was 
[00:08:30]  really surprising  that –  because they were like –  we walked in,  they were like,  okay, there's 2,000 people  out there.  We were like,  oh, jeez, okay.  But their response  was –  they raised this huge  ego stroke.  But, yeah,  I really –  I think the –  with all the people  in the costumes,  it's a really fun atmosphere.  And, yeah, it's great.  I know that people have been like,  it's just turned into  a huge Hollywood junket,  which it kind of,  I guess, has.  Where else can you see 
[00:09:00]  the cast of a show  or a film  and get to talk to them?  I mean,  there's nowhere else  you can do that.  No.  I mean, Spielberg  was here yesterday.  He was a tough one to get.  How was his interview?  I wouldn't know  we didn't get one.  I'm sorry.  But Peter Jackson,  he –  Yeah.  Did you –  We turned him down.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have done that,  but he seems great.  But, yeah,  it's a –  have you been here before?  Yeah, I was here last year  with Sirius,  and we came back this year.  I had a lot of fun.  Nice.  All over the place.  A little bit, 
[00:09:30]  but, you know,  an average amount.  The same as New York.  Nothing spectacular.  As much as I'd like.  Yeah, it's a great place  for –  I mean, you –  everything –  I mean, it's just a great –  yeah, you said, like,  you can see the casts  of everything,  and you see all these –  like, I can't –  I want to see Cowboys,  Cowboys and Aliens,  so I hope I can sneak in.  Daniel Craig was at  Anthony's house.  Yeah, yeah,  he hung out with Anthony,  went to a gun range.  He was over Anthony's house.  And we want to go  to the premiere tonight  just to establish the fact  that he does not  remember Anthony.  We're hoping that he  just is like, who? 
[00:10:00]  Good idea.  And he has the eyes  of a wolf,  if you look at his eyes.  I don't –  I always –  I'm attracted by them  all the time.  Really?  Anthony said he's a beautiful guy,  like, he's a really handsome dude.  Yeah, and I'm happy  to admit that.  Yeah, he's gorgeous.  As you stand up,  do you think help with panel  because you're in front  of 3,000 people?  Are you kind of like  the go-to guy?  I mean, Chevy's obviously  very experienced  with stuff like that.  But are the other  cast members as comfortable?  Oh, you'll see  if you're there the –  oh, yeah, I mean,  Ken Jeong.  If you turn a light  on Ken Jeong,  and, of course,  Donald and Danny – 
[00:10:30]  I mean, Donald's –  his hip-hop career  is exploding,  so he's been in front  of thousands  and thousands of people.  But when –  you get Danny and Donald  going,  and it's terrific.  And we have Jim Rash,  who plays the dean,  and he's also –  the bald guy,  he's amazing.  I'm just so –  Was he kind of a stand-up?  I think he was a stand-up,  right?  He used to do  a really weird character.  Yeah, he was a stand-up,  and that's when he was  a doctor at Kaiser Permanente,  and he was miserable  doing his day job  of being a doctor,  and then he was doing 
[00:11:00]  stand-up at night,  and then he finally –  he got knocked up,  and he finally  knocked up the movie,  and he finally was able  to kind of say goodbye  to being a doctor,  and he'll tell you  how much happier he –  he was pretty miserable  being a doctor.  You know what's funny?  I thought he used to do  a character named  Dr. Ken or something.  Someone said he would kill –  because a lot of comics  have trouble in black rooms.  They're tough audiences sometimes,  but they said he would go in  and do this Dr. Ken character  and destroy the room.  I guess that was him.  Yeah.  I mean, he is like 
[00:11:30]  Rumpelstiltskin in that  he can spin –  he sees the room,  he'll adapt to the situation,  and he can just invent comedy  out of nothing.  What kind of doctor was he?  He was a –  I think he was a general practitioner.  I mean, he was just a –  yeah, he was like a family doctor,  I believe, I think.  It's amazing what people  walk away from  to do entertainment.  People were like,  oh, you were helping people  become healthy,  and now you're just  a silly person  with your penis out.  And he was like,  yes, but he's helping people.  But no, 
[00:12:00]  he diagnoses people on set.  Joe Russo,  one of our executive producers,  he –  Joe was having leg pain,  and the studio nurse  showed up  and basically was like,  this is clearly  a circulation problem.  She called it  some horrible disorder,  and she's like,  you should go to the  emergency room right now.  And Joe started  getting freaked out.  And Ken –  I was like,  Ken went and examined his legs,  and he's like – 
[00:12:30]  Ken started asking  all these questions,  and he's like,  yeah, you have sore muscles.  You have –  you overexerted yourself,  clearly.  He went –  he found out what –  he was like,  oh, you did like  strenuous work  on the house two days ago?  Yeah,  your legs are really sore,  or maybe a pulled muscle.  It's ballsy, though,  because if he's wrong,  and if he really did  need to go to the hospital,  there's a certain amount  of balls to a doctor,  like a courage,  to tell people,  no, you don't need  to go to the hospital,  because there is a risk  they could drop dead.  Yeah.  I guess you could sue him,  but not for malpractice. 
[00:13:00]  It was just like,  a guy told you one thing,  and you took his advice.  Is he still allowed  to practice medicine,  or does that run out?  No, you have to keep that up,  and I don't think he has.  He probably could  if he wanted to.  He could.  Oh, definitely.  And he has that thing  where you can see him  switch and become a doctor.  Like, if someone gets hurt,  you can see him immediately.  He's like a superhero changing,  and he will be like,  oh, you can see  he immediately is,  you know,  doing all the things  that it's kind of  awesome to see.  I'm looking at him,  and from the side,  he kind of has hair  like Alan Alda and MASH. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, he does have  Alan Alda hair.  What's up, Ken?  We're just talking  about you, Ken.  I'm always amazed  by what people  will give up  to come here  and do this.  Something he always  wanted to do,  and he,  like,  doing his residency  at UCLA and stuff  was not,  you know,  it wasn't a coincidence,  I think,  because he knew  in the back of his mind  he was going to try  to be an actor.  Ken,  I just want to show you.  We were just gushing 
[00:14:00]  about you.  We're just talking  about something  really crazy.  I know, I know.  Look at the hands.  Oh, you got it.  Look how small the hands are.  Wow, you do have  small hands.  I have very small hands.  I didn't know  you were a doctor.  Joel just told me  you were a doctor  at one point.  Used to,  yeah, I was a practicing  physician.  Remember he had  sore legs.  Joe Russo had sore legs  and he was convinced  that he had, like,  a blood clot,  like, deep in his leg.  It was a pulled hammy.  That's why I love  my Joe Russo.  The nurse was like,  it might be a clot.  You should go to the nurse. 
[00:14:30]  Joe, you're right.  It was a nurse.  It freaked him out.  I don't want to  freak me out, too.  And then I actually  examined him  in my trailer.  Just me and Joe Russo  in my trailer  palpating his legs  and, like,  stroking up and down  on his thighs.  And I'm telling him,  like, no,  he just pulled a hamstring.  But, yeah, you're right.  It wasn't Joe.  It was a medic.  The nurse said that.  That's so funny.  He'd just gone to the  emergency room.  I got a blood clot.  They're like,  you're fine.  You got to go straight  to the hospital  and get a blood thinner,  you know, stat.  So it's a huge  effing deal.  You weren't afraid 
[00:15:00]  that you might give  the wrong diagnosis  and when he should  go to the hospital  he didn't?  Good Samaritan law.  If I get sued,  I did the best I could.  Good seeing you, brother.  Great seeing you, man.  I love George.  Thank you, Ken.  Oh, one more question.  You did the Dr. Ken  character on stage, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Stand-up,  when I did stand-up comedy,  I was Dr. Ken,  like Patrice O'Neill.  I met him, like,  on the comedy club circuit  and I did BET Comic View  like three years in a row.  I was known for that.  So it was great, man.  I mean,  all the instincts 
[00:15:30]  I'm doing right now  as an actor  is only because of the  you have to cut your teeth  doing stand-up  to survive  and have the instincts  you need to survive a stage.  Yeah, it's all,  I love,  yeah, I'm really proud  of my stand-up.  Owning your performance  on community.  Yeah, that's due  to self-medication.  I'm not like Chevy.  This is great.  Okay, I see, I see.  See you, buddy.  Thank you, Ken.  Yes.  Okay, sure.  Talk about what?  Oh, my God.  I totally forgot.  I wanted to ask you,  too, one of my favorite people.  Now, is this true?  Michael K. Williams 
[00:16:00]  has joined community?  Yes, he is.  He is the new teacher,  the new class.  We're going to biology class now.  He is our teacher.  He's playing,  he's an ex-con.  And so it's kind of,  it's so great.  I mean,  the fact that he is doing it,  I was so that he agreed to it.  I was like,  he's doing it?  So, it's great.  And wait till you see him.  I read what he's going to be doing  in the first few scripts,  and it's hilarious.  Had you seen The Wire?  I have The Wire on DVD 
[00:16:30]  and have watched them  backwards and forwards.  Oh, you know the show then?  Okay.  That's a great show.  And not nominated, ever.  We've interviewed all those guys,  and it's amazing.  I think they got one writing nomination  in season five,  but it's amazing  that Michael K. Williams  or any of those,  Bunk or Jamie Hector,  never nominated for an acting award,  or Bubz even.  It is a crime.  It should have gotten a Peabody  for the things they were doing.  Yeah, show you Peabody,  but yeah,  I mean,  it's one of those series that, 
[00:17:00]  it's like,  you know,  when,  you know,  something like  The Shawshank Redemption,  it got nominated  for Best Picture,  and then you never,  like,  nothing happened.  But then if you look  on top ten lists,  or like Back to the Future,  it's on everyone's  top ten list.  And then you get these movies  that, like,  when Raging Bull  lost to  Ordinary People,  Ordinary People,  when is the last time  you saw someone go like,  oh,  Ordinary People's on,  I'm just going to 
[00:17:30]  watch the rest of it.  Not saying it's a bad movie,  but it's one of those things  that will,  it will live  along forever  because of how good  it is,  and I don't think  anyone will,  I mean,  it doesn't matter  because it's going to  live forever  as one of the best  series ever made.  They're telling us  we have to wrap  Joel McHale.  It was good talking  to you, man.  You're a funny guy,  you're a huge star now.  I went to the studio  in mid-August  when I'm there  to promote a movie.  We'd love to have you.  Thank you, buddy.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts  Comic-Con Adventure 2011. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you,  Joel McHale.  Jim Norton,  I'm Sam Roberts,  and this  is the  Virus Comic-Con  wrap-up,  the Comic-Con  adventure.  I don't remember  what the name  of the show is,  but I'm sure  it said it in production.  We're just  chronicling the adventure  that Jim Norton  and myself,  Sam Roberts,  had while we were  at San Diego  for Comic-Con  just last weekend.  Wilfred  is another giant show.  We just heard  from Joel McHale  from Community.  Wilfred is a show,  it's Elijah Wood's  new show, 
[00:18:30]  and it's on FX.  You hear about it  all the time.  Everybody's talking  about it because  it's very weird.  It involves Elijah Wood  being friends with  a guy in a dog suit,  but everybody sees  it as a dog,  but Elijah sees it  as a guy in a suit.  It's a very strange  show,  but for some reason  it works.  A lot of people  love it,  and that was no  different than  Comic-Con.  We talked to the  cast of Wilfred,  including the guy  who plays Wilfred,  including Elijah Wood, 
[00:19:00]  including one of the  lovely females  from the show.  I got to talk to  each of them  for a few minutes,  and this is what  it sounded like.  Jim Norton and  Sam Roberts  Comic-Con Adventure  2011.  We're here at  Comic-Con with  Elijah Wood.  Elijah, what's  the haps?  No, you know,  Comic-Con, yet again.  I was here last  year.  I've been here  many times.  Is it difficult  to promote a show  like Wilfred at  Comic-Con when  there's 100,000  Lord of the Ring  fans downstairs,  you know,  scurrying about  the floor? 
[00:19:30]  Not really.  It's sort of a  perfect place to  promote the show.  I mean, the great  thing about Comic-Con  is everyone that's  here, they're so  pumped for,  any kind of  content, and  a lot of people  are obviously  coming here for  the specific things  that they're fans  of, but there's  also a lot of  just general  excitement for  what they're being  shown in any  capacity.  So it's always a  great audience to  show people new  things to because  they're very receptive  to it.  Especially different  things because  Wilfred is a very  different show. 
[00:20:00]  Is it nerve-wracking  to do this show?  Because it's so  different.  I mean, you're a  movie star.  You've got a  career.  It's not like,  you know, you're a  first-timer here.  You have a career  to worry about, and  you're doing this  show that's totally  different.  I mean, it's been  very well-received,  I think, so far.  You know, I love  it.  A lot of people  get it.  But was there  part of you that  was like, uh-oh,  what if people  don't get this?  I don't know, man.  I loved the show  so much that  regardless of  whether people  got it or not,  I knew it was  something I believed  in creatively.  I think it's 
[00:20:30]  extremely unique.  It's unlike  anything I've  seen on television.  It has this  really interesting  weird balance  between being  very funny,  but yet there's  something kind of  very real happening  to these characters.  It's ultimately  about a character  who's in recovery,  so at the very  heart of it,  there's something  kind of screwed  up with him,  which is why  Wilfred exists  in the first place.  So it's, you know,  it was exciting  to be a part of it.  And whether or not  people got it, 
[00:21:00]  I mean, we were  hopeful, but I  never really felt  the sense that it  was a risk.  I think we all  knew it was a risk,  but it was something  that we were willing  to take because we  thought it was  interesting and  different, which is  what, you know,  it's always what  I'm looking for.  I think I'm always  just looking for  something that's  very different  from anything I've  worked on.  And it's nice that  there are cable  outlets doing shows  like this now,  like USA's doing  a lot of shows,  FX obviously is  doing a lot of  these comedies  that you don't  really see on  network TV.  No, and the fact  that FX were the  network behind it  to, you know,  I knew intrinsically  that it would  have, we'd have 
[00:21:30]  the creative freedom  to make the kind  of show that we  wanted to make,  which we wouldn't  necessarily be able  to find on a  regular, like,  primetime network.  Years ago, I saw  a show on MTV  that you were on,  I don't even  remember what  show it was,  but you were in  some movie store  obsessing over  looking for DVDs  and stuff.  Okay, yeah.  And it just struck  me because you  were obsessed with  movies.  Yeah.  Are you worried  that DVDs are  going by the wayside,  that everything's  going digital?  I don't know  if it's so much  worried, I think  it's an inevitability.  But does that,  like, do you like  that?  Does it bum me 
[00:22:00]  out?  You know what  bums me out  is the video  store experience.  Yeah.  And that's what  you're doing,  like, searching  through all the  stuff.  And that is  what's sad.  And it's the  same thing that's  starting to happen  with CD stores  falling to the  wayside.  Yeah.  However, record  stores are becoming  very popular now  with vinyl, but,  you know, there's  a great store in  Austin, Texas, I  don't know if you  know it, there's  this place called  I Love Video.  And it's an  amazing store.  They also have a  place called  Vulcan Video, I  think, as well.  And they're great 
[00:22:30]  stores.  They're the kind  of places that  you can go in  and you'll have  that personal  experience with  the people that  work there because  they're knowledgeable  and they're fans of  film and they can  recommend things to  you.  That's an amazing  experience.  And they just got  an amazing commercial.  And they did.  You can't replicate  that with the  digital medium.  That is the one  thing that's going  to be missed, I  think.  You did the  Opie and Anthony  show on SiriusXM  not too long ago.  Do you have any  idea who Jim  Norton is?  Because he's  hoping you do, but  I seriously doubt  that you do.  If you don't, don't 
[00:23:00]  lie.  I don't know Jim  Norton.  Yes.  He's a host of the  show.  He's a comedian who's  on the show and he  sat right next to you.  The guy right next to  me.  No, you don't know.  I do, I do, I do.  Just not by name.  I don't know by name.  I'm sorry, Jim.  I'm so sorry.  I was doing a lot of  interviews.  No, I know.  People sometimes  remember people's  names.  Trust me, no is the  right answer in this.  But that's unfair.  I see that you were  wanting a no.  All right, thank you  very much.  Thanks, man.  It's Jason Gann from  Wilfred.  You're part of this  show in Australia. 
[00:23:30]  Bring it to the  United States of  America.  Was that a risk, do  you think?  Because it's a very  different show.  Definitely.  When, before the  first day of shooting,  I'm sitting in my  trailer and I'm like,  what have I done?  You know, like, am I  about to make a fool  of myself in front of  the whole world?  You know, it's one  thing doing it to a  cult following in  Australia.  But, so it's always a  risk and it's a risk  for everyone involved  in the show.  Me, I guess, a little  bit more because I'm 
[00:24:00]  in the suit.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm  incredibly proud of  the show and I'm a  Wilfred fan.  So, I mean, after I've  shot it and I'm  watching it, I think  every now and then,  oh, that's me.  Yeah, you're just  cracking up at  yourself.  That's a funny guy.  I don't laugh at  many things.  I know if I'm laughing  at me, then I'm  doing something wrong.  Yeah.  You brought this  costume to life.  Well, to life.  You're walking  around in a dog  costume.  We're at Comic-Con. 
[00:24:30]  Would it be a dream  come true to see  little Wilfred's  walking around?  Have you seen any?  You haven't seen  them?  I haven't seen any  dog costumes yet.  There's, I was told  there was going to be,  there's 95 of them.  90?  They counted?  I've had, yeah, no,  they, there's 95 of  them together.  I had a photo with  them.  Really?  And I was originally  told there was going  to be 100.  But there was,  And I said, I'm not  coming out until  there's 100.  Did you bring the  suit?  No.  But, I mean, there's  95 and one of you.  Their suits are better  than mine.  Really?  Yeah.  But I think that 
[00:25:00]  should be the case,  you know?  Like, whenever you've  got a Superman,  whenever kids are  dressed as Superman,  then you've got to  have a crappy suit,  you know?  It's got to have  like baggy underpants  that go on the  outside of like,  No muscle definition.  Yeah, and so I think  that because Wilfred's  charm is his bad suit  that any imposter suits  should be really nice  and fluffy and cute  and they are.  So let there be a  lesson to all you  Wilfred imposters.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you so much.  We're here with  Fiona Goobelman.  Goobelman, yeah.  It's a tongue twister.  From Wilfred.  Now, Fiona, a name  like Goobelman, 
[00:25:30]  kids growing up  would make fun of.  Oh, yeah.  But it seems like  you're good looking  enough that you  could pull it off.  Is that kind of  how it went down?  You know, Goobelman  is, you know,  my whole life  I definitely got teased  and, but I just,  I don't know,  what can you do  with your name  and I would just  laugh it off  and now some of  my favorite nicknames  I still get called  from my last name  and people,  when I first started  acting were like,  oh, you should  change your name,  you should change  your name,  it's weird and this  and I was like,  no way, it's hilarious  and I've actually, 
[00:26:00]  I swear, booked jobs  because I walk in  and they're like,  Goobelman?  From like,  Well, they're not  going to forget.  You know, yeah,  and you can't forget  that name  and, uh.  Well, look,  it's like people,  people teased you,  people said you  should change your name  and now you're  on a hit show,  so.  Hey, you know what?  You can make it  with a name  like Goobelman.  Yeah, obviously.  So, Wilfred,  um, when you first  got the job  and you started,  you know,  really figuring out  what it was,  were you like,  what is this show?  Yeah, well,  when I first got  the script,  I read it  and I was like,  oh my God,  this is so funny, 
[00:26:30]  it's so witty,  I love it,  but what's going on  with this dog guy  in the suit that,  what?  I did not get it  and then I went  that night  and watched some clips  from the Australian version  and I was like,  oh my God,  this is genius,  this is amazing  and so I,  uh,  I went back  and re-read the script  so I read it twice  before my first audition  and I just loved it  so much that I was like,  I have to be a part  of this show  and I think my excitement  just paved the way.  Um,  any nerves based on,  like you said, 
[00:27:00]  you saw the script  and you were like,  what is this show?  Like,  this is weird.  Yeah.  Were you nervous  that people would  see the commercials  and be like,  I'm not going to watch this?  I thought our advertising  campaign for Wilfred  was genius.  I thought they did  such an incredible job.  I,  I loved all the spots  we shot,  you know,  because it wasn't  clips from the show,  it was just these  random funny little things  where you're like,  what is that?  Look,  I was watching  American Idol  and I saw Elijah Woods  sitting next to a guy  in a dog suit  and I was like,  I have to figure out  what this is about.  Yeah,  exactly.  And so I think  it was actually 
[00:27:30]  very smart of them,  very clever to do that  because they were funny  and they caught  people's attention  and they got them  interested in knowing  what it was about  because I think  it's like,  when I tried  to explain the show  to people,  they're like,  their face,  you know,  goes from a smile  to kind of like,  uh,  it's great for you  and so until people  see it,  they just don't,  I don't think  they quite get it  but I think  once you watch  the show a few times  and you really get it  then it's just...  Is it fun to do a show  that's so different?  Oh my, 
[00:28:00]  it's amazing.  I always dreamt  of being on a dark comedy  and so to be on a show  like that,  I mean,  that's,  it really is a dream  come true  and I love being  on something  that's unique  and refreshing  where I'm excited  to read the scripts  and I'm like,  what's going to happen next  or what great lines  are going to be thrown  in there  and,  you know,  I'll see an episode  and on the third time  I catch a joke  I never saw before  so that's just,  it's great.  Obviously,  we're here at Comic Con.  Comic Con.  You can tell.  there's a lot 
[00:28:30]  of wonderful people  who come to Comic Con  and at the same time  there are a lot  of people  who may not be  the most social people  in the world.  What's the creepiest thing  that's happened to you  since you've been here?  You know,  I honestly haven't had  anything creepy  happen to me yet.  So just this interview then?  Yeah,  this,  I'm very,  I'm very,  no,  no,  no,  no,  really,  the funniest thing  though,  I'll tell you,  was,  so we just came  from the signing booth  and Dorian,  who plays  Elijah's sister  on the show,  she and I 
[00:29:00]  were kind of,  we're at the front  of the line  and this girl  kind of walked by  and we were like,  oh,  did you want us  to sign that?  And she's like,  no.  And then,  and then Randall's  sitting right next to us,  he's the director  and he's like,  oh no,  they're on the show,  they're the female leads  and she's like,  no.  I don't,  I don't want it.  She wanted,  she wanted all the guys  to sign it  and we were like,  okay.  So that was funny.  Well,  you'll,  eventually,  you'll be giant stars too.  And then she'll be sad.  You know,  it was so amazing  getting to meet 
[00:29:30]  people that watch a show  and love it  and to hear that.  It does feel rewarding,  doesn't it?  Yeah,  it's like being,  because in your theater  people are laughing  or they laugh like that.  They're applauding  or laughing.  Plus you get to see  all these fans  and say people,  I've seen the numbers  but people really are,  these are real people watching.  I don't,  yeah,  to see the people excited,  that's the best thing.  Awesome.  Well,  it was a pleasure  talking to you.  Best of luck.  Nice to meet you.  Have a great day.  You too.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts  Comic Con Adventure 2011.  All right,  it's Sam Roberts 
[00:30:00]  here for Jim Norton  who would be here with me  but he's far too big  and too famous  to host a show like this.  We're chronicling  our Comic Con Adventure.  You just heard me  talking to the cast  of Wilfred  and that was also  the moment  where if you can,  you can go back  on my Twitter  and find the picture,  the screen grab  if you really want to see it  but I ended up  sneaking my weaselly way  into the back  of a G4 shot  and apparently  a lot of you  watch G4  because I got a lot  of Twitter comments  on that  and I appreciate it. 
[00:30:30]  Comic Con is not just  about the celebrities  you meet though.  It's about the people.  The real celebrities  of Comic Con  are the people  that show up,  the fans  and I didn't think  I was capable  of interviewing the fans.  Jim Norton said  he also said  I can't do it Sam.  I don't want to interview  these people.  I don't feel like  I'm worthy of that.  I'm not where I should be  as an interviewer  and I felt the same way.  We searched high and low  and we were able  to find one man 
[00:31:00]  who was willing  to interview  some of the people  at Comic Con.  That man is named  Lyle Chip  Chipperson.  Yes!  Chip Chipperson  on the floor  of Comic Con  and if Chip  is somebody  who gets under  your skin  see how long  you can listen  to this  without tapping out.  To me it's all hilarious.  It's Chip Chipperson  on the floor  of the San Diego  Comic Con  right here on The Virus.  Jim Norton  and Sam Roberts  Comic Con Adventure  2011.  I sound like  a 12 year old 
[00:31:30]  when I'm on camera.  That's okay.  We just interviewing  people for Comic Con.  Are you having  a good time  or something?  I am.  It's been great.  What's your name?  My name is Summer.  Summer?  Oh,  it's a good time  here.  It is.  Are you supposed  to see Princess Leia?  Yes.  You got a boyfriend?  I do.  Is he,  like,  who is he?  He plays,  he dresses up  as Boba Fett.  Who?  Also from Star Wars.  He dresses up as Boba.  Bob Fett? 
[00:32:00]  Boba.  Oh,  he was like the  bounty hunter  or something,  right?  Oh,  is he,  where's Boba Fett?  I like him.  He's not here today.  How come?  You had to work.  I had a chain like that  one time.  I was chaining my bike  up with it.  It doesn't work for that.  No,  it's too loose.  I don't know what to ask.  Oh,  look,  the guy's got,  like,  lobsters on his face  or something.  Alien.  Oh.  Let me ask, 
[00:32:30]  hey,  what's,  it looks like you got,  like,  red lobster or something.  It's an alien facehugger.  What's that?  It's an alien facehugger  from the movie Aliens.  I've seen the movie,  um,  Alien Abductions.  Close.  Close enough.  They've got your body.  Oh,  that's like a ray gun  or something,  right?  Yeah.  Fits the whole suit.  That's cool.  Does it make a noise?  I had a ray gun  when I was a kid.  Really?  But I would,  yeah,  I would always point it  at the girls, 
[00:33:00]  make them take off  their clothes and stuff  and rape them.  Not a good idea.  Not a good idea.  Hi,  I'm Chip.  Oh,  hi,  what's your name?  I'm Chip.  Hi,  Chip.  Oh,  you got your tie.  It looks like you're  going back to school  or something.  No,  I was just expelled  from school.  You was,  I did too.  We're Hogwarts,  harlots,  and we've been expelled.  I was,  me and my friend Teddy  got caught in the closet  when I was a kid.  How'd that work out for you?  We got yelled at.  Where are you from 
[00:33:30]  or something?  We're here,  from here,  San Diego.  Are you from San Diego?  Is this your first time  at Comical Con?  Yes,  it is.  What are you,  are you supposed to be  the ladies from Hogwarts?  Yeah,  we're Hogwarts bad girls.  What's bad?  Uh-oh.  We're too cool for school.  We're too hot for school.  Yeah,  I was too hot for school too.  I would put on the air conditioning.  They could use them  without it here.  Yeah,  there's a lot of ugly people here.  Look at that guy's hat.  I hope he gets shot. 
[00:34:00]  I hope he gets shot.  I was just kidding.  He likes when I say  mean stuff about people.  Are you having a good time?  Yes.  Oh,  look at this.  The person's all yellow.  Looks like they fell into  some lemonade or something.  He's like a Power Ranger.  Oh,  wow.  A lot of camel toe.  I think that's definitely  a girl,  yeah.  Yeah,  I think so too.  I hope so.  Otherwise,  he's got a little one. 
[00:34:30]  All right,  we'll see you guys later.  I'm just riffing,  just joking around  or something.  Please continue to move.  It's a fire.  Okay,  we're just doing  like a little interview.  Are you having a good time,  sir,  at Comical Con?  Please, sir.  I'm going to have to  ask you to move aside.  Thank you.  Keep moving.  Keep moving, folks.  I'm trying to do  my interviews and jokes.  There's too many  cripples here.  Everybody's in wheelchairs  and stuff.  They shouldn't let them in.  Tell this guy to be quiet 
[00:35:00]  because they're all  in a chair  and throwing over  people's toes.  They should just make  them sit in the sun  and bake like  a bunch of raisins.  And over here,  look at the Lionsgate.  They should say,  what do you see  outside a lion's house?  Lionsgate.  I just keep going.  I don't care.  Hi,  can we interview you?  Wow,  that's really cool.  What's your name?  My name's Savannah.  Looks like you ate  a bunch of blueberries  or something.  Yeah,  pretty much.  What's that supposed to be?  I'm Mystique  from X-Men. 
[00:35:30]  Mystique?  Mystique.  Oh,  it looks like,  well,  that's really cool.  Is that paint?  Yes,  it's body paint,  yeah.  How do you get that off?  A really,  really hot shower.  Oh,  yeah,  I take a lot of cold showers  though,  because you know  what I'm saying.  What's your name?  I'm Leah.  Hi,  are you having fun?  Yeah,  I am.  It's really fun here.  There's a lot of  big fat people here.  I hate them.  You said it,  not me.  I know, 
[00:36:00]  it bugs me though  when they're all fat  and stuff.  Don't you hate that?  No,  not really,  no.  That's what you should  say to your boo  because they stepped  on your feet  or something.  Oh,  there you go,  yeah,  exactly.  How long did it  take you to do that?  Probably like two hours,  right?  Yeah,  like two hours.  And you just put it,  you didn't put it  all over yourself,  right?  Not,  not everywhere,  no.  Yeah,  not,  you know.  Yeah,  not everywhere.  But yeah.  How come you didn't  dress up?  You just got your shirt on.  She has squat ears. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I didn't even,  let me see that.  Oh,  could you get that  with the camera?  It looks like you're  trying to listen to  something in Timbuktu  or something.  That's real pointy  and stuffy ears.  Yeah.  You should probably  jab somebody  right in the eye  like that.  Yeah,  there you go.  Yeah,  just take their  fucking eyes out.  All these fat people.  Well,  it's nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Have a good  comical kind.  It's on Chipper TV  on YouTube.  Chipper TV? 
[00:37:00]  It's T-H-I-P-P-A-H.  Chipper.  Do you guys have  like a card?  We had one,  but he gave a bunch  of mouth  because Steven Spielberg  was here  and Bruce Williston.  Okay.  Very cool.  Well,  thank you guys.  These are easy.  Hi,  how are you?  Good.  How are you?  I'm okay.  I'm Chip.  What's the kind  of gun is that?  It's a blaster.  And a blaster?  And what do you  use that for?  To kill people.  Where are you from? 
[00:37:30]  Star Wars.  You're from Star Wars?  Is that like a place  or something?  I'm from Apocalypse.  What have you  heard of the movie?  What?  How old are you?  21.  21?  Oh,  so you just  started drinking?  Yeah.  Wink,  wink.  What's your name?  Mariah.  Hi,  I'm Chipper.  I like your chain  or something.  Is that like a real  bike chain?  I had one like that  and my friends  used to whip me  with it. 
[00:38:00]  What's my back?  It's plastic.  Oh,  I had a bike chain  one time  and my friend  Bruce took it off  and he was whipping  my back  and told the police  made him stop.  That sounds  like it would hurt.  Yeah.  Do you come with a bunch,  is there a bunch of guys  that you like here  because they're all  dressed up as different people?  I came with a group  of people.  Oh,  did you guys drive  or take a bus?  We drove.  Oh,  we took a plane.  Yeah,  I think my group's  leaving now,  so.  I'm sorry. 
[00:38:30]  Have a fun time  at Comical Con.  Bye-bye.  It was nice talking to you.  That chick  wanted to fuck me  so bad.  She was getting  all wet and sloppy.  Jim Norton  and Sam Roberts  Comic Con Adventure  2011.  Thank you,  Chip.  I mean,  the Comic Con floor  was just full.  of individuals.  I'm Sam Roberts.  There were over  100,000 people  at this thing  and I guess  we got a handful  of them,  but I mean,  just everybody  in a little costume.  Everybody just  had a great time. 
[00:39:00]  So,  you can't blame them  for that.  But there were  more celebrities  that we still  have to get to  and one guy  is a guy  who he shows up  at Comic Con  and these are  his people.  I mean,  he runs this place.  He was called  the mayor of Comic Con  by the guy  who interviewed him  before me.  I'm not nearly  clever enough  to think of  something like that  to call him.  So instead,  we just reference  that interview  even though we  have no record  of it.  I guess you'll  hear it all.  It's Bruce Campbell,  the man from 
[00:39:30]  the Evil Dead  trilogy.  He was promoting  a Burn Notice  The Fall of Sam Axe,  his Burn Notice  spin-off movie,  which, I mean,  to be involved  with that many  successful projects  over such a long  period of time  is something  that doesn't happen  too often in Hollywood  and to have fans  that are as loyal  as the Bruce Campbell  fans are,  well, it's a sight  to behold.  This is my time  with Bruce Campbell  from Comic Con  2011.  Jim Norton  and Sam Roberts  Comic Con Adventure  2011.  Sam Roberts here 
[00:40:00]  with the legendary  Bruce Campbell  at Comic Con.  What's going on?  Bruce, what's the  haps?  The haps are  Comic Con, man.  It's the beast  that rolls into town  like locusts.  You're here promoting  Burn Notice,  The Fall of Sam Axe.  Yep, the tragic story,  the prequel story  of Sam's last mission  as a real soldier.  Did you realize  when you signed up  for Burn Notice  you'd be such a hit  that you'd be getting  spin-off movies?  Yes.  Okay, good to know.  Well, it's good  to have confidence.  It's just truth. 
[00:40:30]  It's not confidence?  No, it's not  arrogance or confidence.  When you just know,  you know.  I see.  Like you, today,  you just know  that this is going  to be an amazing interview.  Is that just my vibe  right now?  Yeah, you feel it.  I feel it right now.  You know, you come,  part of the vibe  is the way you look.  You run Comic Con  pretty much.  You're a god around here.  Well, as the mayor.  Yeah, that's what I said  in the last interview.  You're the mayor of Comic Con.  You could come here  looking like a schlub  if you wanted to.  No, no,  because that's the job  of the fans.  You just come here  looking like schlubs.  Yeah, no,  my job is to counteract  the lack of effort  they put into 
[00:41:00]  those camouflaged  cargo shorts.  You are dressed  to the nines.  How long did it take  you to pick out  this ensemble?  Nine minutes.  Really?  No wonder you saw it.  Actually, the wardrobe  department from Burn Notice  did it.  They costumed you  for this?  It's a cool thing.  It's like the old days,  you know,  like Clark Gable  could go into MGM  and go,  I need an outfit  for tonight, kid.  And they would  make him an outfit.  So I'd come into  the wardrobe department  and say,  Comic Con.  Yeah, I need something.  Two words, Comic Con.  Your, uh,  Burn Notice has been  such a hit.  It's had quite a cult  phenomenon. 
[00:41:30]  How happy are you  that finally there's  something that people  can talk about  in minutia with you  that's not  the Evil Dead trilogy?  Oh, it's always good.  You know,  if you stick around long  and if you can get  involved in other stuff.  This came out of nowhere  and it's fun to just  do a different character  that doesn't have  a chainsaw attached  to his arm.  How have you managed  to survive this long  in this business?  I just don't go away.  Just stay relevant.  In some way,  I don't know.  That's the secret.  Don't leave.  Don't leave.  Hi, still here.  Sorry, guys.  Still here. 
[00:42:00]  All right, well,  thanks a lot, Bruce.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  It was a pleasure.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts  Comic Con Adventure 2011.  Thank you very much.  That was Bruce Campbell.  I'm Sam Roberts  and this is the chronicling  of the adventure  that Jim Norton  and myself had  at this year's  San Diego Comic Convention.  It doesn't stop.  No, sir.  It doesn't stop.  The Mythbusters.  You talk about science fiction.  How about just science?  They're a group of people  who have managed  to take a show 
[00:42:30]  that is science-based  and turn it into something  that is entertaining enough  for a mainstream audience.  I mean, Danny,  our own Danny  from the Opie and Anthony show,  he loves the Mythbusters.  Jim got to sit down  with Cary Byron  as well as Grant  and Tori from the show  to talk about the show  and also to bring up  something that Danny  had tweeted to Cary Byron.  When I say Danny loves the show,  I mean he loves the show, 
[00:43:00]  but his desire,  shall we say,  for Cary Byron  doesn't just go beyond creepy.  It sort of gets to the point  where you might want to call  authorities on the whole thing  because you don't know  how far he'll take it.  He's not a guy  who knows when to say when,  especially when it comes  to matters of the heart.  And that's how he feels  about Cary Byron.  This is the Mythbusters  with Sir Jim Norton  on our Comic-Con recap.  Jim Norton  and Sam Roberts  Comic-Con Adventure 2011. 
[00:43:30]  All right,  so you guys are Emmy-nominated.  Is this the first Emmy nomination?  No, this is our third year in a row  and we still haven't won.  We're hoping that this is our year.  Well, everyone says,  oh, it's so nice.  I mean, it is nice to be nominated,  but man, I'm sure  it would be great to win.  But who is beating you?  Well, that's not a very nice question.  I wouldn't say beat us.  It's just that it was their year.  Intervention,  Jamie Oliver's Food Nation,  I think, won one year.  Ugh!  What, you don't like food? 
[00:44:00]  No, I think you guys should win.  Well, thank you very much.  I think you guys should win.  I think it's crooked  and somebody's probably  paying off other people.  I think you should be winning.  I think it's just an honor  to be able to wear a fancy dress.  See, but that's why she's successful  and I'm mediocre  because you say the right things.  I would just go,  ah, fuck everybody else.  You guys are smart  and you say the right things.  Is it disappointing to lose?  I mean, obviously it is, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know,  you always go in hoping to win  but you know what?  The competition is really hard. 
[00:44:30]  There's a lot of great shows  and this year, actually,  Deadliest Catch is nominated  and I think they're  a really strong contender.  What do you think it is  that determines,  okay, we're going to give it  to this show and not this show?  Because you guys have been doing  such original stuff for so long.  I mean, you're part of the culture.  Everybody knows Mythbusters.  Everybody knows what it is you do.  I mean, you had President Obama  did one of your shows.  Yeah, you know what I think it is?  It's usually the shows  that are saving lives,  getting people off of drugs  or alcohol  or getting little fat kids 
[00:45:00]  to stop eating so much.  Oh, no.  No.  Little kids who are overweight.  Can we edit that?  Yeah.  Little kids,  little kids who are overweight,  you know,  or shows about little kids  who are overweight  and helping them  not eat unhealthy.  Yeah.  Although, you're right, though.  Saying little fat kids  is not bad  because that's what it is.  It's kids who are not eating healthy  and if it's helping them  lose weight,  it's seen as a public service,  I guess.  Yeah, right.  But then again,  what you guys do  is also a public service.  I mean,  you're showing people 
[00:45:30]  that certain things  that people think are myths  are actually dangerous  and certain things  that you think would be dangerous  are actually not at all dangerous.  Yeah, you know,  the questions that keep up  people up at night  like do girls fart  and is driving sleepy  more dangerous  than driving drunk?  Like, you know,  really important stuff.  Now, did you really do  one on the girls fart?  No, it actually never aired  on Discovery.  Maybe they thought  it was too embarrassing  so it's on the internet  unfortunately  but yes,  I showed up to work one day  and they gave me 
[00:46:00]  a pair of underwear  with a microphone  and a hydrogen sulfide meter  in the area  and it was linked  to the PA system  in the shop.  It was quite a day.  And do they feed you  a certain amount of food  or a certain diet?  Well, after a while  it took a really long time.  I don't know if I was nervous  but they wanted me  to eat cabbage or beans  or that sort of thing  after a while  but I ended up producing  in the end so...  What food did it? 
[00:46:30]  That's a girl.  What a great way  of saying that.  So what food did it for you?  I mean, for me,  McDonald's.  Bad news.  Bad news.  Yeah, we're not having  this conversation.  Now, do you think  somebody did that  as a goof  or they really thought  maybe this will make the error  and just at the end  they went, eh.  You mean, are they just mean?  Are they just pranking me?  Yeah, just something silly to do.  That's totally possible.  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.  I mean, I never knew  it was a real mystery.  Were you shocked  to learn the truth?  I was not shocked 
[00:47:00]  to learn the truth  but, I mean,  it was a full episode.  It had been edited.  It was incorporated  into what was going to be  the final show  and then last minute  they pulled the plug  and said,  mmm, not so much  and had to re-edit the show.  Now, did you guys,  when President Obama  did the show,  did any of you guys  get to meet him?  No.  I didn't see the episode.  Who was he actually there with  or was it nobody?  Was he not actually  in the facility?  Jamie and Adam  actually went to the White House  and did the opening  to the show with him  so he didn't actually  come to our set  so we didn't get to meet him. 
[00:47:30]  Now, you guys  come here every year.  You're a pretty big feature  at Comic-Con.  Your panels sell out  or I should say  are full every time?  Yeah, actually.  These are our people.  These are the geeks.  These are our fans  so we come here  and they appreciate us.  We really like this.  What do you like  about Comic-Con?  I mean, obviously  it's great to get  the adoration  but what do you find here  that you don't find  in other places?  Well, I mean, for us  we actually get to meet our fans.  We're pretty insulated.  Our shop is not in Hollywood  with all the celebrities  and for us it's just 
[00:48:00]  we have a basically  blue-collar job.  We show up every day,  we get dirty,  we go home at the same time  so to come out to Comic-Con  and kind of realize  that we're on TV  and meet our fans  and see the effect  that we have on them  is really wonderful.  What was the first time  you realized  like, wow, I'm a celebrity,  I'm famous  or I'm well-known  by people who probably  never would have known me?  I still don't see celebrity.  No, you are though.  I mean, you are  even though your attitude  doesn't make you seem  like a celebrity  because you're very nice  and down to earth  but by definition  you are one.  What was the first time 
[00:48:30]  you realized  like, wow, people know  who I am?  When I got invited  on the Opie and Anthony show  I was like, I have made it.  Is she good or what?  She really is.  You're a great actress too  because nobody thinks  they're famous  and they get invited  on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's usually the end  of a career.  People are like,  I'm on my way out the door.  I would, yeah.  Now, Danny,  obviously on our show.  Now, what has Danny  been pestering you to do?  Besides the obvious.  Oh, I think he actually  has been on the Twitter 
[00:49:00]  trying to get people  to get an autograph  of some artwork  from one of the booths  but I haven't been able  to make it.  Has he asked you?  Yes.  He actually would like  to come visit the set.  I've invited him.  I said we'd give him a tour.  Yeah, what a horrible mistake  that is.  You know that, right?  You know, I gave you a tour  so I figured, you know,  we have to invite him.  But you know that  I'm a nice guy.  I'm not creepy.  Danny's got like  a creepy love for you  and he'll just lurk around  and he'll quote every episode.  He'll really bug you.  Me and Kenny came by  after we went to San Quentin.  Yeah, but you showed up  in sweatpants.  How creepy is that? 
[00:49:30]  Fair point.  You know what?  We had a strip club  or something?  Well, almost.  I mean, we took a tour  of San Quentin.  One of the guards is a fan  and they said  you can't wear jeans.  So I guess because  it resembles too much  what the convicts wear  so we have to wear sweatpants.  So I wore sweatpants  and I didn't realize  that that would be  really creepy to show up  in a pair of sweats.  So my apologies.  Well, you know,  hopefully Danny will show up  in like a three-piece suit  and offset all the creepiness  that you brought.  And stop asking her  to do stuff for you,  stupid.  She's busy. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Thank you guys very much.  Hey, good luck.  I actually hope you win the Emmy.  Thank you.  Good seeing you again.  Good seeing you again.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts  Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  Well, that's it, folks.  That's all the time  we have for you.  I hope that we've managed  to put you in a place  where you feel like  you were there with us.  I'm Sam Roberts.  This has been the recap  of the Jim Norton  and Sam Roberts  Comic-Con adventure  of the Jim Norton  and Sam Roberts. </pre>
