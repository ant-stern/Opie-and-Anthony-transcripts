<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Ben describing a U2 concert in Boston, highlighting the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry among attendees, the unique stage setup forming a "human heart," the unexpected setlist, and a discussion of a U2 video featuring Charlton Heston, leading to a comedic bit mimicking Heston's famous lines.  This transitioned into listener calls focusing on complaints about excessive Puerto Rican flags displayed on cars after the Puerto Rican Day Parade, sparking debate about the parade, car modifications, and passionate responses from Puerto Rican-American callers.  The conversation then shifted to the Philadelphia 76ers and Opie's sports jinx, briefly touching on the New Jersey Devils' underwhelming parade, and including a news clip about the show's Philadelphia syndication and Opie's admitted ignorance of Philadelphia sports.  A discussion followed about a Special Olympics commercial showing an athlete falling, leading to insensitive humor regarding the portrayal of the athletes.  Further calls included one from a listener who found the show unfunny after only two days. This prompted a discussion about the show's humor. A song about a childhood friend with special needs was played, followed by a detailed, graphic discussion about Timothy McVeigh's execution, his last meal, and a lengthy, explicit tangent on unusual and messy bathroom incidents, including the invention of terms like "upper decker" and "dry docking."  Multiple callers shared their own bathroom anecdotes, including one describing a friend who vomited feces. The segment concluded with promotion of an upcoming TV appearance and a "Wow Sticker Stop" event.

The show continued with numerous caller stories and discussions revolving around bodily functions and sexual acts.  Sarah recounted a childhood bowel movement incident, followed by anecdotes from a septic company owner, Joe, about human waste.  The hosts discussed lethal injection, detailing the physical process. Callers shared more bowel movement stories, often with humorous and graphic details.  This segued into the "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge," involving a lubricated wiffle bat and female participants, leading to the introduction of the "Motley Crue Challenge," a similar contest using a large dildo and a $100 bill, with active solicitation of female callers to participate. Discussions about a Philadelphia radio contest promoting a sports team (including a previous incident involving an offensive sign) and the "Hi Mom, I'm Gay" prank segment also took place.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com graphically described his back waxing experience, including audio of him asking his girlfriend to wax him.  The show also featured Mendy, the editor of Big Butt Magazine, and her planned participation in the Motley Crue Challenge, along with discussion of her article about Opie and Anthony and the magazine's content. Jim Norton and Jay Moore were present in the studio throughout this segment.

The show's chaotic nature continued with offensive jokes, sexually explicit discussions about body hair and pornography, and celebrity anecdotes about Eddie Murphy, Phoebe Cates, and Scott Wolf, often with humorous but offensive embellishments (including a lengthy story about Scott Wolf's constipation after taking Vicodin).  Several commercial breaks were interspersed, some interrupted by off-color commentary and the antics of a crude ventriloquist puppet, resulting in a lost client. Commercials included one for LASIK eye surgery and another for Paisano's of Mulberry Street.  The "Motley Crue Challenge" formed the climax, featuring two overweight naked women, Mendy and Carmen, competing for a $100 bill using a double-ended dildo.  The hosts and guests provided sexually explicit commentary. Tony Danza briefly appeared, visibly uncomfortable, before quickly leaving. The challenge, messy and chaotic, concluded without a clear winner, with the hosts expressing disappointment at the outcome and promoting foundrymusic.com for video footage.  Rockaway Bedding was among the sponsors advertised.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Good afternoon.  How are you, Anthony?  Very well.  I love that bit.  It's pretty disgusting.  We got the gang back together. Ben is back in the studio.  Yeah, he was out Friday, but he's back.  Ben went to Boston to see U2.  Go Socks!  Ben, I guess we gotta start by asking you, how was the U2 show?  U2 show was great, but Anthony, one thing you always love about Boston?  Was the obligatory Yankee suck champ in full force Friday night on the way into the fleet. 
[00:00:30]  They were so loud. Some poor South War Yankees out there.  I thought the guys were getting murdered.  The Red Sox fans up there in Boston are very proud of their team, and they despise the Yankees.  And no matter where you are in Boston, you will hear, you can be in church, doesn't matter.  You will hear, Yankees suck, Yankees suck.  Very good. Congrats to a Boston.  I think that happens in every city in America, except for New York. 
[00:01:00]  Except for New York. I don't know.  Yankee fans don't feel compelled to just yell, insert team here sucks.  How was the show, Ben? You had fun?  Unbelievable. Two different shows. Completely different shows.  You went, what, Friday and Saturday?  Unbelievable. Completely different. Great show.  I know they're playing down in Philly tonight.  Yeah.  Excellent show.  Yeah. How much are the tickets going for?  Yeah. What the hell is that about?  They were going, they wanted to...  Ben goes to me, because I'm a huge U2 fan. A lot of us around here are.  And Ben goes, I love the show. Oh my God, you gotta go. 
[00:01:30]  Ben, I don't have $3,000 for a ticket.  That was, some idiot told me that.  They were, I had a friend that paid for one.  It was a decent seat for $200 outside the fleet, right before the show.  It was a decent seat.  Very popular up there in Boston with the drunk Irish.  They love U2.  They're kind of doing that Metallica snake pit thing, but U2 is doing like a big heart,  Anthony. And then there's like, part of the audience, what, about 300, 400 people maybe?  Yeah, 350.  That are in the middle of the heart.  And then U2 is playing, you know, around those people and of course in the rest of the arena. 
[00:02:00]  It's not like a place where you can go to videotape it though, is it?  No, no. I like those shows.  What was the highlight for you?  I don't know. I mean, both shows were completely different.  They did songs that I'd never thought a team would do, like Party Girl on Saturday Night  and Out of Control.  Streets Have No Name is pretty good.  Bullet the Blue Sky is pretty, pretty over the top with some Charlton Heston video in there.  Nice.  Good.  Mr. NRA. 
[00:02:30]  What's Charlton Heston?  I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  Yeah, I guess it's good.  Is it from Planet of the Apes?  No, it's recent.  Yeah, oh, recent?  Is it where he picks up the musket and goes,  From my cold, dead hands!  I love that guy.  Was that it, Ben?  What?  From my cold, dead hands.  Will you pry this weapon?  Samuel, I love you two!  Samuel, was it a clip from Planet of the Apes, where I was looking at Zira's red monkey mandrel 
[00:03:00]  ass, yearning with a big lump in my loincloth.  Damn you all to hell!  Were they mocking me?  I'll set my staff upon these waters, and turn it to blood!  Or something.  I don't think I have that power anymore. 
[00:03:30]  Charlton Heston, are you a U2 fan?  I love U2.  You do, huh?  I love drinking Guinness and listening to U2 while I fire my gun in the air.  I was at the show the other day.  I started volleying shots, you goody-holy idiot.  They love me!  I love my guns and U2.  Damn you!  But, but, was it a clip of me with Dr. Zayas? 
[00:04:00]  That orangutan red monkey mandrel ass?  Damn you all to hell!  Don't use my image at a rock show!  Did you bring Nova, sir?  Nova.  To see you, Tim?  Nova.  I done brought her years ago.  You see her now?  She looks worse than an ape!  What happened?  That time's a bitch!  Time plus gravity equals yee!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Heh-heh!  Ooh! 
[00:04:30]  Was it that clip, Ben?  From my cold, dead hand?  Come on.  No, hardly.  Come on, give me something.  What was it?  Come on!  You don't want to spoil it for the fine folks in Philly tonight?  All right.  It's, it's, it's a great show.  Phenomenal.  Very, very good.  Well, you missed a great radio show Friday.  Right, I heard.  We had a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Yeah.  Let's go right to the phones.  Uh, 877-692-1027.  Let's start with Steve.  Steve, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, and hey.  How you guys doing, man?  Doing well, man. 
[00:05:00]  Could you tell your Puerto Rican listeners, please take the flags off the car already?  I haven't seen them for the last few weeks.  Enough.  Enough.  Yeah, there's a lot of Puerto Rican pride.  Yeah, they were killing me.  It was a big day in New York yesterday.  They had the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  Yeah.  All over the place.  I'm in Jersey, too.  I see them there also.  You remember what happened last year, of course.  Oh.  The gropings and the videotaped sexual assault on the chicks.  Well, they turned the Puerto Rican Day Parade into one big, uh, wet t-shirt.  Yeah.  A wet t-shirt contest. 
[00:05:30]  It was wilding.  Yeah, ban the flags.  It banned the super soakers.  You have a problem with, uh, what, the Puerto Rican flags on the cars?  Yeah, I mean, enough already, you know.  Everybody's got their day, you know.  Three weeks already.  I'm sick of it.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you, Steve.  All right.  But it was relatively safe this year?  Yeah.  No real problems, I don't think.  I was very injured at the parade.  Very injured.  See what happens when they, uh, take our, our, our booze away?  They took the booze away.  And I went up to a young girl and asked her how many kids she had. 
[00:06:00]  She was 12.  And I was beaten about the head by a bunch of Puerto Rican hoochie mamas.  You see how they dressed up their little kids?  That's the sickest thing, man.  You see, like, there was one woman, she was so psyched.  She was so psyched that her little one-year-old was dressed like a little Agila.  Like a hewa.  And they're all, they're holding them up.  Ooh, mommy, look, look.  And they dress like, in little bikini things. 
[00:06:30]  And they're one years old.  One year old.  And the cars, how many friggin' Toyotas, Tercels, and Corollas can they get on the roads?  With the, uh, the clearance underneath the car, you can't fit a butter knife under.  And they got the, they got the, uh, I like the spoiler on the back of their Corollas.  Like that thing is going to get up to about 250 miles an hour.  It might leave the road.  It might leave the roadway if it wasn't for the spoiler.  But, uh, they got the black spray paint tinted windows. 
[00:07:00]  That friggin' crown air freshener on the dance board.  I never knew what the hell that was.  It's an air freshener.  Yeah, it's an air freshener.  And for some reason you need blue neon lights all over your car.  Shinin' on the road.  Looks like something from, uh, Close Encounters.  And what about the Jesus Saves, uh, decal?  Yeah, Jesus, uh, and the Jesus Christ headlight stencil.  So you, on the headlights is an image of Jesus Christ. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, that's what the Lord really wanted.  It's like the bat thing.  Yeah.  They turn their headlights on and it's Jesus Christ being projected.  And you forgot, you forgot about the little steering wheel.  You know, that's so they could drive handcuffs.  I don't know about that old gag.  The little steering wheel and the little skateboard tires on the car.  And they drive cars like that so they could look original.  So they could be their one of a kind.  Really, uh, showing their independence.  And the flags.  God, if that was me, I, I gotta tell you.  If I see a Toyota Tercel driving down the road with one of those flags on it. 
[00:08:00]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  That was a copy item?  Well, there's gotta be something going on in that car.  Jesse.  Yeah.  Uh, you're an angry, you're an angry Puerto Rican.  Why?  You're damn right.  Tell that boy, that one that said that he wants the Puerto Rican flag off the car,  that if he's mad enough to come to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue in 20 minutes,  and I'll be waiting for him to try to take the flag off my age.  I smell radio bits. 
[00:08:30]  Try to remove the flag.  Try to take the van and ram it up his butt.  All right, were you at the parade yesterday?  Yes, I was.  Right on, okay.  How about an American flag on the car?  I got one of those too, buddy.  Nice.  Do you really?  I'm a proud Puerto Rican American.  So, but you're representing the United States as well?  That's right.  All right, I have no problem with that.  All right.  You get the, you know, the American flag somewhere.  Oh, it's on my van, believe me.  All right, cool.  All right.  All right, Jesse.  Take it easy.  I was watching, though, and I was watching some of the coverage on TV, 
[00:09:00]  and you see that the Hoochie Mama Parade, they get out there,  they're wearing these costumes that, I'm sorry, Rick,  I know you're Puerto Rican, but only a Puerto Rican chick would wear.  Rick, Rick.  Colors that brought together could stop time.  Rick is Spanish.  Spanish.  He is.  He'll tell you.  He'll tell you.  Spaniard.  Spaniard.  Spaniard.  Gladiator.  Do you know Marcus Aurelius, Mike?  Yeah.  Let's hit Eric up here. 
[00:09:30]  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Congratulations on the syndication.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, we're going to be adding some new markets this week.  Okay.  Check out the details soon.  What's up?  All right, listen.  That Corolla thing, right?  Yeah.  Unless it has the 1.8 liter on the back of it, it's no good.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, they buy, even if it's a 1.6 Corolla that they buy, they go to the dealer, they  take the 1.6 sign off, they buy the 1.8, and they just stick it in the back of it. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Because it shows more power.  That's funny.  As long as it shows more.  You don't need it.  Right.  It doesn't really matter what's underneath the hood.  It's just the 1.8.  Well, you've got to give the Puerto Ricans credit.  They know how to...  Patrick, he should know about it.  They know how to, you know, spiff up those vehicles.  Yes.  And the goofy musical horn.  Don't forget the goofy musical horn, man.  Yeah, if it plays La Bamba or something.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Spaniard.  Rick is the Spaniard.  Let's go to Jim, who's...  Hey, Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you? 
[00:10:30]  I just wanted to say, Friday's show was effing hilarious.  Yeah.  With Jane Moore and John Sally and the sex lady or whatever.  Yeah, Laura Corn.  Sally rocked.  I think we got a new friend of the show.  I was pissing myself listening to you guys.  I also want to know when Black Girl is going to come to a sticker stop in Philly.  Well, we've got to kind of build up an audience down there before we do anything.  Well, Friday's show definitely made an audience.  And, Opie, you've got to stop cheering for the Sixers.  Ever since you started cheering for them, we've been losing. 
[00:11:00]  That's absolutely right.  You people are learning the Opie sports jinx.  Yeah, the people in Philly weren't listening closely.  When someone from New York on Thursday said, guys, you don't want Opie rooting for the Sixers.  I do have a bad story going on.  Opie's partial to the Mets, the Jets, and the Islanders.  And the Knicks.  You know what, though?  I was rooting for the Devils in Game 7.  I swear to God, I apologize to Jersey.  They F'd that up.  I guess there's no more parade in the parking lot. 
[00:11:30]  I could give a flying F that Ray Bork finally won a Stanley Cup.  Just stay away from the Phillies team.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  You don't care about Mission 16W?  Mission 16W?  16 wins.  Oh, it was Ray Bork's Mission 16W.  The Stanley Cup's winning Colorado Avalanche.  And after 22 years, Raven Marks!  Oh!  Woo! 
[00:12:00]  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah, who cares?  Big whoop.  A lot of the Devil fans get angry when a lot of people don't support the Devils.  And really, because, you know, they're in the Stanley Cup Championships, and no one really cared.  And now they lose, and no one really cares.  It seems to me that the fans don't really care.  No.  Honestly, if you want to know the truth, the Devils have some hardcore fans.  Yeah, but not enough of them.  I was watching some of the games, and there's empty seats.  At a Stanley Cup championship, empty seats. 
[00:12:30]  And then when they won last year, their parade was in the parking lot.  Wow.  I mean, geez, that's sad.  Come on.  There were like eight people waiting for them at the airport.  Where the hell do you want them to, you know, march?  In the middle of Newark or something?  I don't know.  I mean, Newark's coming around, but...  The hardcore Devils fans get really pissed when they don't get support, but there's not enough of you guys.  Rally your troops.  Speaking of Ray Bork, Ben, really fast.  You did mention that the U2 show in Boston.  Yeah.  Listen to this one that Bono pulled out of his sleeve to get everyone on his side during the show. 
[00:13:00]  No, well, Ray Bork is one of the sports guys from Boston that they still like.  Right.  Not like Clemens, who's absolutely hated up there.  And he's a dick.  But that's okay, since I'm a Red Sox fan.  But Ray Bork is still loved.  And, no, they kept giving, you know, the score.  And then for the Encore, the edge was with the old Bork, 77.  What a guy.  I'm sure he was like, who's this?  Yeah.  They probably didn't even know who Ray Bork was.  Who the hook is this? 
[00:13:30]  So what?  He walked out for the Encore with the jersey?  Yeah.  No, they were giving score updates throughout the show.  There were a lot of interaction with the crowd during the show.  Oh, spilt the Guinness on the show.  Get me another one.  Who the hook is this?  Did you care that Ray Bork finally won his Stanley Cup?  I'm actually happy for him, yeah.  Because I'm from Boston.  And you are so Boston.  You will never, like, shed that.  I'm happy for Ray Bork.  He was a great Bruin. 
[00:14:00]  They love him up there.  I mean, he was a good...  You sound like his voice guy.  He was a great Bruin.  Wonderful.  Like, he's dead.  Well, congratulations to Ray Bork.  Yes.  Who cares?  Hey, Anthony, before we take a break...  Yeah.  We all know we're on in Philly on WYSP.  Mm-hmm.  The local news did a little piece on us, and we got the audio.  Thank you.  Oh, they did?  We already have some, I guess we could almost call them listeners,  listeners of the show that are helping us out and sending up all the clips  so we could have fun with it. 
[00:14:30]  Okay.  Remember when we did our first break from Philly and stuff,  and we're talking about, you know, sports, and you're like,  I don't know anything about Philly, and I don't know anything about Philly sports.  I don't know.  We gave them like 20 or 30 minute, you know, stuff they could have used on their little news clip.  That's what they used?  Have you heard of this yet?  No.  Makes you look pretty stupid.  Well, what the hell do I know?  Listen to that.  See, it is a major change in the Philadelphia airwaves this evening.  New York Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony are now on the air at sister station WISP-FM. 
[00:15:00]  I'm being honest.  I know nothing of the sports teams, the city, nothing.  But I'm willing to learn.  You don't know anything about the Sixers?  No.  I'm not, and this is nothing new.  You know, I'm not a big fan of basketball.  I know it's huge in Philly right now.  This is no...  I hear the Sixers, what, they're doing well?  The two replaced John DiBella, and the show does not feature music.  Observers say the syndicated show is part of a major change in the entire radio industry.  Opie and Anthony are under contract with Infinity Radio, the company that owns WISP and KYW News Radio. 
[00:15:30]  The show originates from the WNEW studios in New York.  K-1-A-B-E-N-E-W, sign 528.  Oh, great.  That's the clip they used.  I know nothing.  I'm a retard.  I'm a moron.  Thank you.  Here's a clip from their show.  The duo shot jocks are on WISP.  Here's a clip. 
[00:16:00]  That can be heard every afternoon right here.  Thanks.  In Philadelphia.  Did I say anything intelligent that day?  I guess not.  That was what they picked.  Sport team.  Sport team.  They played sport.  Back to back.  76.  I prefer 77.  I don't know.  Philadelphia.  I like the cream cheese. 
[00:16:30]  I like the cream cheese on my cone dog.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Feeling great.  Feeling great.  I like the beaches.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, well.  There you have it.  I'm trying to play a bit as we go into break here.  It would have been one of my physics breaks.  It would have been a break when I talk about space-time continuum. 
[00:17:00]  No.  I know nothing about Philadelphia.  Hey, let's play special ed.  That's me.  Special ed.  Yeah, it's a good tie-in.  By the way, Stinky.  Yeah.  I think you left the office.  I think he was laughing at a poor Special Olympics kid tripping and falling.  Oh, no.  They got a commercial.  What's the commercial for? 
[00:17:30]  They actually show the Special Olympics where they're, you know, right, I think it was just  like a promotional commercial and showing how they work together, you know, even though  they're retarded, they can pick the other one up off the ground and drag them across  the finish line.  Yeah, like the beaches of Normandy or something.  You got to pick up your wounded.  But imagine the director, he's like, okay, we're going to have you run, but then you have  to fall.  And it's like this retarded kid, he has to run and fall.  He's running and he falls.  And they're really retarded.  Yeah.  Of course they are, right?  No, but you can see it in their face like it's all I am. 
[00:18:00]  Well, Rick, they're called Down Syndrome children.  Yeah, whatever.  So, of course, they're retarded.  But how do you explain it to them, like?  Well, the gorgeous kid from Life Goes On took direction.  Maybe he would go, so I walk and then I fall.  I did that every day.  Maybe, I don't know, maybe they just showed, you know, video from the actual Special Olympics.  Yeah, it might have just been a real Special Olympics clip.  Maybe they didn't have to set it up.  No, it wasn't set it up.  Like they wouldn't have a clip of a kid falling.  No, but it was like different camera angles and, you know, everything was set up the right way. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  It was like a three-camera shoot.  Yeah.  I think he was laughing uncontrollably, though.  He thought it was a funny thing.  He was insensitive prey.  Why did you think it was funny?  I just need to know.  Just because they made a commercial where they actually paid a retarded kid to run and fall down and pick him up.  And they're supposed to feel good.  That he ran and fell and someone picked him up.  Hey, nigga, gotta eat.  Are you upset that he got paid?  They didn't have to pay him.  He would have fell by himself. 
[00:19:00]  They could have saved a lot of cash.  Just keep the camera on him.  He's going down sometimes.  Make a commercial where a retarded kid runs and falls and they pick him up.  I'm glad you find humor in other people's pain.  Oh, a lot of it, too.  I've seen you trip walking out that door sometimes, stinky.  Hey, Glenn, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How are you?  Good, how are you guys doing?  Calling from Philly.  What's up?  Yeah, I'm from Orland, Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  I've been listening to you guys for about two days.  And you guys aren't that funny. 
[00:19:30]  That's too bad.  That's good.  You guys think it's any funnier?  No, this is about all we do.  I mean, I gave you guys a chance for the past two or three days.  I'm just waiting for the punchline.  Then I do believe it's time to change the dial already.  You know, at least when you play music, if the music sucks, you can turn the music off and wait for the next song to come on.  Yeah, two days is quite enough.  I think, to really get into the show.  Ask New York and ask Boston how good this is going to get, okay?  Don't worry about it so much.  Don't feel you've got to call up after two days and say, you know, does it get better? 
[00:20:00]  I would just wait.  I would suggest you give us a month.  You'll see.  You'll see.  The month of time you, what, spend in your car, hang out at work or something.  It's not like we're asking you to sit in a seated room for eight hours a day and do something.  If you're not laughing over the Sylvester Stallone crapping bit, then I don't know what to tell you.  I mean, come on.  I just know that's funny.  Come on.  Award-winning show we have here.  And I know the listeners we have already know that's funny.  So what can I tell you? 
[00:20:30]  Anthony Steven Lynch, really good friend of the show, obviously.  Might as well play special ed as we take a break here, okay?  Let's talk about me.  Coming back, we've got to talk about Timothy McVeigh.  Oh, of course.  We're not going to talk about it like everyone else talked about it.  No, I like the little stories.  Just a couple observations and lots to do today.  Stay there.  This is about a childhood friend named Ed.  Ed.  Here we go.  Don't touch those buttons, either.  I see you looking at them. 
[00:21:00]  When I was a boy of ten  I had a very best friend  Ed was kind, with good intent  But just a little different, all special ed 
[00:21:30]  Mama dropped him on his head  Now he's not so bright and sad  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  We'd play tag  And he'd get hurt 
[00:22:00]  I'd play soldier  He'd eat dirt  I liked math and a spelling bee  Ed liked talking to a trio  Special ed  Mama dropped him on his head  Now she keeps him in the shed  Cause he's a little bit special 
[00:22:30]  Cause he's a little bit special  A little bit special  I ran track  Hung out in malls  Ed ran head first into walls  I had girls  I had girls  And lots of clothes  Ed had names for all his toes  Oh, special ed  Mama dropped him on his head 
[00:23:00]  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  One day talking to special ed  He grabbed a brick and he swung in my head  And as he laughed at me 
[00:23:30]  That's when I knew  Special ed just made me special too  And now I laugh  As I count bugs  I give strangers great big hugs  Next to me  Ed is fine  He's a up to gang 
[00:24:00]  I'm Stein  Oh, special ed  Now we're not right in the head  You see  Now we're not so bright  Instead  We're a little bit special  Just a little bit special  That bastard ed made me special  Just a little bit special

[00:28:00]  There's nothing really to see  It's pretty dull  From what I'm reading  Yeah it was  Witnesses that said  Yeah well  He looked at everyone  Laid back  And kind of  Took two deep breaths  And then his lips  Kind of went like  And he died  With his eyes open  Which is kind of cool  Yeah  He died with his eyes open  But listen  One other thing though  Man  I was watching CNN  Later on  And they were talking  About it  And you know  Like the preparations  They do and everything  You guys ruined me  I'm sitting there  Watching it at work 
[00:28:30]  I busted out laughing  They said you know  He had eaten  They stuck a catheter in  In case he had a squirt  Then they gave him  A butt plug  What?  They gave him  A butt plug  They do that to him?  Yep  Just in case  Anything came out  Not just in case  When you die  Everything  Yeah  Has to leave your body  And it comes out  And who wants to  Clean up that mess  From you know  From him  Jeez  What a great final thing  To have happen to you  Oh yeah 
[00:29:00]  By the way  Did anyone die  In the Penn Station  Bathroom today?  Holy ass  No no joke  Without the butt plug  I get off  The Long Island Railroad  I have to take a leak  Really really bad  I head into  The men's room  Okay  And I am telling you  There was crap  Everywhere  Like a crime scene  Not just one or two  Everywhere  All over the walls  All over the floor  How did that happen?  That's what I wanted to know  I can understand  Sometimes you get that  That stripe up your back 
[00:29:30]  Like you know  Like you're riding  Your tent speed  Through a mud puddle  Right  You know  And your t-shirt  Kind of gets  Sometimes the back  Of the toilet seat  Gets that  I don't even know  How that happened  But for it to get  On the walls  And the floor  And everything else  I can't understand that  Maybe there's a cop  That works that area  Could explain  What the F  Happened in that bathroom  I'm assuming  I've never seen  Anything like it  No Anthony  Even if you're a nut  You know  Okay they're gonna  Whatever  Throw it like a monkey  Sure  There was so much crap  It had to be coming 
[00:30:00]  From somewhere  Like just exploding out of it  It was insane  Maybe he couldn't make  Okay  Alright  You're running to the bathroom  You know how it is  Like you can hold it in  Just until you gotta go  And you're almost at the bathroom  And then you reach  Critical mass  And maybe he was  Getting ready  You pull down  Your trowel  You spin around  And as you're spinning  You go off  Like a lawn sprinkler  You know  All over the whole thing  In a spinning motion  That might work  Two stalls  Two urinals  It was in each stall 
[00:30:30]  Wow  Because I had to go so bad  And the urinal  All over the urinal  All over  This bathroom exploding  With crap  Wow  How does that happen  Someone's gotta help me out  And tell me what the hell  Happened in this bathroom  M80 in the toilet  Disgusting man  I can't listen to that  I don't know  But I need to know the answer  Because it was just  You look at this  And how does it get like this  And then I feel sorry  For the person 
[00:31:00]  Who has to clean up this bathroom  It's somebody  They gotta get in there  With the squeegee  And the hose  It's not so bad  No  It's not  I found it  It's not so bad  What a mask  Let me see if Steve has an answer  Steve what's going on  How much  Hey  Did you see that bathroom today  I wasn't  I was in there today  But I didn't see when you did  But I go in there  I work in a construction  And it's beyond  It's unbelievable  How bad it is 
[00:31:30]  Yeah  Filthy  Disgusting  Alright Steve  Thank you  Hey  Steve had nothing  Reiterates what Opie said  I need to know  No  If anyone else  Walked in this bathroom  They know exactly  What I'm talking about  It was just  Unbelievable  It could be a kook though  Just picking it up  And smearing it places  They tend to do that  Hey  If they're throwing it  On the buffets  And delis  Who the hell knows  What they're doing  On the walls  Of bathrooms  We'll get back  To Timothy McVeigh  In a second  But now there's  Another bathroom  You're really 
[00:32:00]  Really caught up  In this  This was  I just  I was just reminded  Of this  Right outside the building  Yeah  The N and the R  There's a bathroom  Right there  What would it be  The 50  57th and 7th  Yeah  When you first get in  When you first get out  I mean  Downstairs  Or you mean 34th  When we get out  The 34th is where  All the crap was  All over the place  But the one outside  The building  The N and the R line  I had  The other bathroom  Was locked  This was a couple days ago  So I had to go 
[00:32:30]  So I pop out  Of my stock  At the 7th and 7th  Or whatever  Are you insane  What  Why wouldn't you just  Use the bathroom here  You're like the only  White guy  That uses those things  What  What  I'm telling you the truth  I would rather  Poison myself  With my own urine  And bile  I'll tell you why  Because just to  Get a key  To unlock a bathroom  Around here  Is a pain in the ass  Sometimes  Get a key  But it's not the point  You've got to hear this  Alright whatever  I walk in  There's a homeless lady 
[00:33:00]  It's the men's room  Homeless lady  Did you do her  Taking  Nice  Taking a dump  In the urinal  Get out of here  I swear to you  And she  In her drunken way  Is like  I'm in here  Did you see  Did you see some  No  Imagine what  Imagine the mess  That that is  Imagine the odor  Oh  The whole undercarriage  Just looking like  One of those old  Rusted  Chevy trucks  I'm like  I just want to  Take a leak  Barnacles 
[00:33:30]  Barnacles  And there's a homeless woman  On the urinal  On the urinal  And the stall was empty  I mean  What is she doing  In the meds bathroom  Begin with whatever  But the stall was empty  But she decided  No I need to take my crap  In the urinal  That's her house  Yeah  You were in her house  Why don't you knock  Before you come in  This is my house  My house  Let's go to Mike  Mike what's going on  Hey buddy  How you doing  Alright  Yeah I clean all the  All the bathrooms  In South Philly there  I handle it all  In the speed line  And everything  Yeah  Wait wait wait 
[00:34:00]  Look at the two cities  Getting along  See  Something that Mike  Can relate to  In Philadelphia  Yeah I walked in  Several times  And actually caught  Homeless people  Men  You know  And even when I do  The women's bathrooms  I knock  Make sure there's nobody  In there  I go in to clean up  And you actually find them  Rubbing the feces  On the walls  Well you gotta do that  Taking it out of the stalls  That they didn't even use  Other people's feces  They rub it on the walls  Just in pure disgust  For the city I think  I completely believe it now  It's horrible  I am not kidding you  I've walked  And I wish I had a camera 
[00:34:30]  This would be internet worthy  Right on  I mean we are talking  Disgusting  Alright  See that's something  That just completely  Skeeds me out  Cause we've all seen  On the internet  The Chinese women videos  Where they crap and stuff  Yes we have  I cannot even watch that  Never mind walking  Into a bathroom  And seeing it  Smeared on the wall  You just walk right out  And I gotta carry  A digital camera around  Cause if I had pictures  Of what I saw this morning  Yeah  You would puke  It wasn't just a little  It was everywhere 
[00:35:00]  Nice  Every  Everywhere  Well I'm glad  You had a great day  In the bathroom  You ever drop  An upper decker  Wait Jim Norton  In the studio  Upper decker  What's up man  That's when you drop  A log in someone's  Septic tank  Oh the tank up top  Yeah  It's called the upper decker  You know how you got  The toilet ball  And the tank  That sometimes you gotta  Lift the top off of  And fix that mysterious ball  Yeah  So it doesn't run  Well if you go in the tank  It's called an upper decker  And you know that water  Ends up in the ball 
[00:35:30]  After you flush  So somebody can go  To the bathroom  It's fun to do at parties  Because when you're  Giving up a decker  At a party  Hold on  Some chick goes  Into the bathroom  Uses it  Flushes  And then walks out  The next person that walks in  Sees this beautiful girl  Walk out  And there's this  Disgusting load of crap  Left in the toilet  Hold on  It's fun for everyone  Hold on  It sounds like you  Have done the upper decker  Anthony  No I've just heard about it  I've never done the upper decker  Like I said  The feces grossed me out  I knew about the  Friggin little  Shopping bag  That the homeless people 
[00:36:00]  Use in the bathrooms  And I never did that  Remember I told  Norton Matt's story  I knew that too  I knew that too  So what's up with  The upper deckers  Norton  It's just  Just to disgust somebody  Because the whole bathroom  Stinks  And I can't figure out why  And each time you flush  A little more comes out  You might be  Popping milk duds  Down into the lower deck  For a week  Before you actually know  Where it's coming from  Right  What a disgusting  You have never  Invite Norton  Over your house 
[00:36:30]  Oh man  Enough for decker  Pat what's up  You ever just wipe  With one of their towels  It's the best of Stallone  Leaving the Penn Station  It's there for them  Yeah  Stallone was in that bathroom  Alright  Alright take care  Alright where were we  Keep it in me  Timothy McVeigh  Yes McVeigh  Who I'm getting news reports now  His final words  Were your mom's box  Which is a little odd  I think he was a fan of the show  Everyone's final words  Your mom's box  Your mom's box  He put to death  Opie  Obviously this morning 
[00:37:00]  A lot of people  Very happy about it  I was more  Taken by  The whole  Leading up to his execution  Reading about what he did  Sat  Talked to his lawyers  Wrote some letters to his family  Had his last meal  Which was  Two pints of  Mint chocolate chip ice cream  And then  Slept  This is the part  That floored me  You're sentenced to death  You're dying in about  Twelve hours or so  And you sleep 
[00:37:30]  I used to  I used to  I couldn't sleep  If I was going to Disney  The next day or something  You know  How about this  When we found out  We were going to be live in Philly  Oh I couldn't sleep  Wednesday night  I couldn't sleep  No  Here's a guy who's going to die  And he's sleeping like a baby  Yeah what do I got  Twelve hours  And I don't sleep  You're going to have eternal sleep  Sleep shouldn't even be on your mind  And how do you sleep  Knowing that you could wake up  You know how fast time goes  When you sleep  You know you go to sleep at eight  Wake up to midnight  You're like oh  It was like two minutes  How do you know  You're not going to wake up  And say come on 
[00:38:00]  Time to die  You've got to just be  Looking at my arms  And stuff going  You'll be dead soon  I would have to just  Whack it all night long  Just spank it like a caged monkey  Why would you sleep  Yeah you're going to stay up  Get one last rape  And a shower in  For memory sake  You know something  He was just  He was watched constantly  For quite some time  I don't think he had an option  Or an opportunity to do that  Just all that backed up  You would just have to  Do it in front of the guards  At that point  Yeah  What are they going to do 
[00:38:30]  You're dying  Who cares  What are they going to say  Hey man this is Timothy McVeigh  Is a pervert  Who cares at that point  Ben and Jerry's coming out  With the McVeigh mint chocolate chip  They have a little thing on the box  It's the bomb they say  It's a little crude  But it should sell  You know what's weird  They had the witnesses  Yeah  You know to witness the execution  They had to go through  A metal detector  What was that about  We all know  Who they would want to get at  If they happen to have  Any firearms on them  We all know 
[00:39:00]  How this is going to end  Is it really going to make a difference  Piper video cameras too  They don't have any cameras  Yeah they're saying  The biggest  They were saying  Hackers might be able  To get into  The closed circuit system  To get a video  Of him dying  But then they said  The more probable thing  Is somebody with a little camera  Because it's on a big screen  It's like you're watching a fight  Back in the old days  You know  You couldn't get to the fight  So you would go to an arena  And watch it on a big screen  And they're thinking  People might bring in  These little micro cameras  And videotape it 
[00:39:30]  But from what I hear  It was just dull  Nothing  You strap him down  And you put some dope in him  And he falls asleep  The first drug they give you  Is a sedative  Kind of relax you  He died like my dog  Fresca  Same way  Aw now poor little Fresca  Very peacefully  Steve what's up  You should have died  Like my cat Smokey  Hold on  Hold on  Where Smokey got hit by a car  And my father said  That Smokey ran away  And then I was walking  To school one day  And I found a carcass  Covered with maggots 
[00:40:00]  And the closer I got  I looked and realized  Oh my god  That's Smokey  My dad lied  Said Smokey just ran away  Smokey was dead  Getting eaten by maggots  You should have died  Like my grandmother  With a pillow in her face  Being sodomized by me  Steve you're a funeral director  Yeah I'm a funeral director  In New York  And not everybody lets  All their fluids or functions  Go when they die  No  No  No but the ones that do 
[00:40:30]  I let my resident take care of  Oh really  Yeah  Not everybody does it though  So what happens  Right when you die  Your bowels don't release  Not everybody no  Just a couple of people  It'll happen more  If a person's at home  Maybe he was lactose intolerant  Or something  And that's why he had  The mint chocolate chip  Because why bother  You're going to be dead anyway  You're not going to have  To feel the cramps  Nothing like that  You just let go  Mint chocolate chip ice cream  All over that gurney  Tom what's going on 
[00:41:00]  Yeah there's a reason  He had the mint chocolate chip ice cream  Huh  All the injection fluids  They use  The chloride and stuff  Yeah  When you die  He's actually going to pass  Fluids  Well that's what they  They say  But they put a butt plug in  They plug it up  So he doesn't leave  All over the gurney  I don't know about that  I'm sure they had a mess to clean up  Alright thank you  Yeah I just want to  Leave the biggest  I'd be eating raw pork  Last meal  I want raw pork  And beans 
[00:41:30]  And just  I want to leave  A disgusting mess  All over that gurney  Hot garbage  Just yeah  Coming down  Pouring off the side  To the witness's horror  Leo  Yo  What's up Leo  What's up now  I just want to make a comment  About the upper deck  We used to have upper deck battles  When I was in college  Upper deck battles  Upper deck battles  We used to go to parties  And obviously  Upper deck to party  It got so bad  And out of control  That people used to have to like  Walk the top of their toilets  So they used to go in toilets  And have big chains 
[00:42:00]  And big catalogs  Over the top of it  Lock up your upper deck  Lock the upper deck  Because it just got out of control  After a while  You got to pick up an axe  To get through like Brando  When he attacked his refrigerator  All right Leo  Thank you  All right  See you later  A lot of people  Have done the upper deck thing  Andy  Hey guys  What's up  Hey  Hey you guys ever hear  Of a guestie  A guestie  Yeah  Basically what it is  Is you got  You know  Five or six of your friends  At some party  Somebody don't care  You draw a straw 
[00:42:30]  To see who goes first  To last  Then you'll each go  Into the bathroom  And take a dump  Without flushing  Just pile up  Loaded  Oh god  They got to take it out  With a shovel  When you're done  The best thing would be  Upper deck  Later guys  Upper deck  Or get these  Yes  How did we get here  I don't know  I have to apologize  Talking about McVeigh  Mike what's going on  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Hey I did that upper deck  I was about 16 
[00:43:00]  My mom was having a party  She's a nurse  We used Campbell's  Creamy tomato  Was not a good sight  My mom was pissed  I never heard of this  Upper deck thing  Yeah  Oh yeah  We'll use it at your next party  Opie  Oh  Alright thank you  And that makes a mess too  Alright guys  How's it going  Alright man  Wow  That's disgusting  I don't know how we get here  All the time 
[00:43:30]  Okay  There you have it  Yeah  Timothy McVeigh  Dead  Now people can move on  Closure  A lot of people said  They didn't even care  It's like you know  The victims  Families  Kind of watched on  And went  I was expecting some closure  But it's really not helping  It's not going to bring back  Your dead relative  It's kind of cool to watch  I'd want to watch  In that way though 
[00:44:00]  Yeah I don't care  Just watching somebody  Actually dying  Right then and there  It'd be kind of cool  Sure you'd want to see  Something rising up  Off it or something  But I don't know  I think it'd be cool  Watching somebody  Just die like that  Better than some  Horrific car crash  If you've got to be a witness  Somebody just going like that  Yeah okay  You could watch your grandma  Die if you didn't leave  The hospital room  No she still had  A few weeks after  I visited her  You didn't ditch her  No  Alright this guy wants  To top all crap stories 
[00:44:30]  Before we take a break  Yes Shahid  Hey how you guys doing  How you guys doing  Thanks  Yeah I got  You guys are telling  The feces stories  I got one that's going  To top all of them  There was  A friend of mine  That I knew  When he was a bit older  He's like in his 50s probably  He was an habitual drinker  Drank every day  For like a month  Went on a binge  The guy  He couldn't  He was constipated  So he couldn't  Use the bathroom  What ended up happening  He threw up  All of the feces  Right inside of his  Fort yard  That can't be possible 
[00:45:00]  I swear to God  It's very possible  That is impossible  I saw it  Did he die  It's very possible  Did he die  Yeah  Pardon  Yeah did he die right there  No he didn't die  As a matter of fact  He's still alive  You might have seen  Like big congealed  Bile or something  There is no way  Feces can go  From your intestine  Back up  Into your stomach  To be thrown up  It can't happen  His wife  Rest her soul 
[00:45:30]  She told me the story  That day  I saw it right  In front of the house  I said hey  What happened  Her name is Joyce  And she told me  He's been constipated  And he had to get it  Out of his system  We'll get a doctor  On the line  To prove that  Check it out  Check it out  Do you know  How big  How long  Your intestines are  And at the point  How far down  Your intestines  It actually turns  Into crap  It's so far down  That you don't  Throw up that way  It's your stomach  That's contracting  And throwing up  Never your intestines  Dough boy 
[00:46:00]  What's going on boy  That's insane  If you guys go on  To a certain website  I don't know if you guys  Want to bleep this out  So nobody hits it  Real quick  Yeah  It's collegehumor.com  Okay  They have a couple  Videos of people  Infiltrating upper deckers  On other people's houses  It's actually kind of funny  Really  Yeah  Alright we'll check that out  Good times  Isn't that what  The internet's all about  When the scientists  Decided to get together  And make this thing  So they could  Trade their ideas  From college to college  Did you think 
[00:46:30]  They ever thought  There'd be college kids  Taping upper deckers  And sending them out  Over the same  Exact system  That was supposed  To trade  For maybe  I don't know  Nuclear power  And  World peace  I don't know  Same thing happened  With the printing press though  They said when that  Was invented  Used it for porn  It was just used  To write  Yeah  Pornography  Without even  Picture  Right  Just reading it  You had a read  Big typesetter in there  Alright  C 
[00:47:00]  U  N  Jay what's going on  How you doing guys  Good  There's another variation  We used to do in college  What you do is  You go in there  And you do the upper deck  Or didn't even know  The name of it then  And you turn off their water  So it stooed for a while  Until they figure out  What the hell's wrong  What's that called  A dry dock  A dry dock  It's awesome man  And it smells worse  Than the regular upper deckers  I bet  That's funny 
[00:47:30]  Wear some AZT  Dry docking it  Yeah  Oh god  That made me laugh  We spent the first hour  Of this show  Talking about duty  About crap  How did that happen  Dry docking is the greatest  Thing I've ever heard  Dry dock  You turn the water off  And then you do the upper deck  Brilliant  Jim Norton in the studio  We'll talk to him next  Also we have a chance  For you to win  Tickets to see the Sixers  We'll get the details  On that next  Okay  Alright  This guy's  Hold on

[00:48:30]  Kind of squish it up  But even that  I find a little  Hard to believe  And another thing  That goes along  With upper deck  Is a side story  It's called  Skydiving  What's skydiving  You prop yourself  Up above the stall  With your legs  Straddled  Of the walls  Of the stall  Yeah  And you try to  Drop it  Into the ball  You might have  Too much time  On your hands  We did it  When we were young  Alright  Alright  Thank you Steve  That's great  You're trying to  Think of Dumpy's

[00:53:00]  Than Timothy McVeigh  And the execution  Is the biggest story  To hit this country  In years  But people would rather  Discuss  All the fun things  They can do with crap  Fun  Exciting things  College students  Homemakers  Doesn't matter who you are  Sarah  What's going on?  Hi guys  Good to have you back  On the air  Oh thanks  First of all  I'm gonna have a hard time  Eating for the rest of the day  Yeah  After a conversation  But why are boys and men  Obsessed with doing  Fecal matter tricks? 
[00:53:30]  That's a great question  That I just don't have  An answer for  I mean  Yeah  Okay  It's funny  I guess  I  But these like  Communal things  With people loading up  On top of each other  And toilets  And like  A little gay  I don't get it  Norton  Do you have an answer  For this?  No no  I figure  Probably they have  So much fun  With their period  And all that stuff  We needed something  That was ours  Yeah  It's a hoot  I don't like  The crap thing  I just  Get over with  And get the hell  Out of the bathroom  But we find it funny  Like things like  The upper deck 
[00:54:00]  And the top  Why is that funny though?  I don't know  Think of the visual  Of some guy  Placing himself  Above  The tank  Lifting the tank  And trying to  You know  Hit ground zero  That's just weird  The visual's hilarious though  Like one time  When I was a kid  I don't get it  To make my friends laugh  I decided to  Drop a log  On a piece of  Pepperidge Farm  White bread  That's disgusting  Well now hold on  You did this  Yeah I made a sandwich  And I put like  A little club toothpick  For it  Yeah  A little wrapping  And I just put it on a plate 
[00:54:30]  And handed it to my friend  And we just giggled  For a half hour  And then I put it in the street  And a car ran it over  See that's funny Sarah  But like you could  How old were you  This guy?  Fourteen  Fourteen  Very good  Like that?  Huh?  I mean like  You can stand  Just holding it in your hands  Wrapped around a piece of bread  Like that?  There was a plate in between us  And my friend told me  He heard me gimmling in the bathroom  He knew something was up  Yeah it was great  All right  Thanks Sarah  All right enjoy  We really got to move on  That's how we get there  Joe what's going on?

[00:55:30]  We called him Stinky LaRue  One day  He came in  And um  The toilet was clogged up  So he goes  I'm going to have to give it  A hand plunge  A hand plunge  He put his hand in there  And just started plunging  Like he's giving it a CPR  I couldn't imagine doing that  When there are things like  Pride and go slow  Bob from Jersey  McVeigh's death  Lethal injection  Is actually one of the worst ways to die  Oh stop  It looks peaceful 
[00:56:00]  Because the guy's not moving  But actually he is suffocating  He's fully aware  But cannot take a breath  He is just silently screaming  For about five minutes  Until the brain dies  Oh well  Sucks to be him  Yeah the second thing  First they give you the sedative  Then the second thing they give you  Is this really intense  Muscle relaxer  That makes your diaphragm  Just go limp  And your lungs collapse  And then the third one  They give you  Stops the heart  Well doesn't the first one  Knock you out  Does it you know  Yeah it like sedates you 
[00:56:30]  I don't know how much  It knocks you out  Because he died  With his eyes open  They said he put in  The first chemical  And he took these real sick  Like two deep breaths  Well no  Not quite that nasty  And then  Then he just died  But his eyes open  Was kind of cold  Kind of neat to think of  Alright back to the beauty  Uh Jay what's up  What's up  Hey  I don't know if you guys  Ever did such a good  Crap in a bowl  You had to get someone

[01:12:00]  Jesus  Jay Moore in the studio  Is that the new tool?  What?  No  What was that?  Ramstang  Ramstang  Ramstang  Isn't that great?  To yourself  You can just pitch a goose step into that, right?  That's too harsh  Tim Savian, the PD of WYSP in Philadelphia on the line  Let's talk to Tim real fast  Tim, what's going on?  Opie!  Anthony! 
[01:12:30]  Hey!  What's going on?  How you doing?  I'm doing great  Listen to the fake excitement in Tim's voice today  No, I am excited.  That was yesterday.  Yesterday's over with.  It's forward momentum now.  I hear you guys are keeping us from all the negativity coming into your fine radio station in Philadelphia.  We're just keeping it all on the DL.  A lot of people upset that the music's gone.  That was yesterday.  Get over it.  We're over it.  We're going forward.  Yes, we are.  You've got to explain this campaign you're doing for the Sixers tickets.  You've got to make a banner with your pride for YSP and the Sixers. 
[01:13:00]  If we spot it, just we'll come out with tickets to the Sixers and Lakers playoff games or the championship game.  You have to be creative.  Include the Sixers and 94 WYSP in your banner.  Make sure it's visible to a lot of people.  Melissa and our extreme team will be out to judge it.  Is it the best display?  Get some tickets or do you have a bunch of them?  We've got a bunch of them.  A bunch of tickets.  All right.  Very nice.  There you go. 
[01:13:30]  Would you like to get the C word on live TV down there in Philadelphia?  We did that up here.  It was great.  There was a reporter doing a live shot on the street in Times Square.  And there it is right behind her.  Rose up, not to be missed.  A big sign.  See you.  And then you know the last.  And boy, was she pissed.  Ouch.  Would you like us to do that for you in Philadelphia?  Hey, whatever you need. 
[01:14:00]  Look at that.  We call that the A-bomb as far as the media goes.  Yeah.  We pulled out the A-bomb.  No, we keep that in our back pocket for those special moments.  Yeah, we'll save that one.  Yeah, when the media really, really pisses us off, then we pull out the A-bomb.  Yeah, save that.  Turn down the line.  At that point, they deserve it.  There you go.  Then it gets all hard for them.  They've got to do their live shots standing on the top of their vans.  Yeah.  We had them doing that for about three months.  They let their guard down now, so it might be time for another A-bomb.  Don't let them get comfortable.  All right, Tim.  So we'll get people doing that for you for the Sixers ticket. 
[01:14:30]  That would be incredible.  All right, Tim.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks.  Tim Sabian.  Bye-bye.  And the one that's going to be judging the contest down there in Philadelphia, the  lovely and talented Melissa.  Melissa.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hi.  Hey, don't give Tim a heart attack, all right?  He's got enough going on, and he's really sensitive, you know?  Oh.  Oh, we loved him.  I know.  He was the first program director braving us to take us in syndication.  Yeah, he's pretty brave.  It's been quite brutal, but, you know, people are starting to turn a little bit, I think. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  It's only been three days.  It's going to take at least a month.  It takes a while.  At least.  If not longer.  If not longer.  After three days, I don't care what people are saying.  We haven't done much yet.  Right.  Well, what are they saying out of curiosity?  Um, well, I got tomatoes thrown at me at, uh, at the other day.  You got a tomato thrown at you?  Yeah.  And they said that I'm kissing up to you guys already.  So, how did I get a bad rap in all this?  Uh-oh. 
[01:15:30]  The people that you...  Don't they know?  I've been on your show for, like, five months already.  They should understand that.  We know Melissa very well.  We're throwing stuff at a beautiful girl.  Who the hell is doing that?  Yeah.  What kind of flaming homo does that?  Well, you know what?  I can do something about this.  I'm going to go to the YouTube concert tonight, and I'm going to talk to people, let them  know you guys are cool, and, you know, everything will work out just fine.  You know, you do.  You go, I can't stand them either.  I wish they were off.  And then they'll like you. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, maybe.  Do whatever.  You're crazy that way.  Do whatever you have to do to survive, Melissa.  Yeah.  You know, we've known Melissa for about a half a year now.  Yeah.  She helped us on XFL game day.  Oh, we'd like to forget about that.  I forgot about it already.  I'm successful to career together.  I watched XFL game day in my house in Los Angeles like a proud papa.  Thank you, Jamie.  You're welcome.  Watching your retarded kid in the Special Olympics, maybe.  No, it's watching my great son, my prodigal son, getting drafted by some crack team, and 
[01:16:30]  I've got to watch him, you know, like, you know, hit RBI doubles while everyone else, like,  loses balls in the lights, you know?  People lose balls in the lights all the time.  Philadelphia is a new listener.  That's a national lewd town, Philadelphia.  Hey!  You know, the Liberty Vows got to crack right down, right down the middle. 
[01:17:00]  Thank you.  Hey, Melissa, thank you.  Hey, have you guys, did you guys watch the Sixers game last night?  Yeah.  It was a pretty good one.  Pretty close.  Usually I get front rotation.  There's a lot of black young men on both squads and those things, but, hey, how about those  Lakers wearing purple?  Like Luger Vandros or somebody at the Image Awards, the blacks love flashy colors, ball one  to grace.  That's why you see a lot of jewelry and things that are shiny.  Grace gets hit in the face when the ball goes down like struck by lightning. 
[01:17:30]  Black people's cars usually have some kind of funny lights on the bottom.  Especially Dominicans.  And I, you know, I was at Grace being carried out on a stretcher.  I was at the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  And, boy, those people like loud noises and colorful things as well.  You know, their flag is red, white, and blue, just like ours. 
[01:18:00]  Mark Grace has died.  Thank you, Harry.  That's horrible.  Harry, Harry.  You don't want to see a guy.  Hey!  Hey!  He's a creative.  Hey!  Melissa, you're interrupting the great Harry Carrier.  The great dead Harry Carrier.  God forbid.  I'm going to get off the talk and listen to him.  All right.  And the Sixers should have won last night, Melissa.  No, they shouldn't have.  Yes, they should have.  No, they shouldn't have because they did not.  Will Smith hitting that shot at the end there killed the Sixers. 
[01:18:30]  No.  Will Smith.  That made the Lakers win.  I understand that.  I understand that.  The MVP is all his free throws.  They did everything they could.  Guys like Lynch absolutely destroyed them off the bench, shooting like one for 11.  That guy missed a dunk for crying out loud.  And if those referees, feel free to put a whistle in your freaking mouth and jog the length of the court, you fat asses.  I have never.  It looked like a freaking kung fu movie every time somebody touched a ball in the paint.  But it was fair on both sides, Jay. 
[01:19:00]  It was a prison riot on both sides.  There was bodies on the baseline.  Photographers were being carried out on army cots, for Christ's sake.  But I love when they let them play.  I like when they let them play, but then don't call.  And I want the Sixers to win.  Seriously.  But I'm saying this.  Fair is fair.  If you're going to let guys tackle each other under the boards, don't call like Derek Fisher for his fourth freaking foul in the beginning of the third quarter for a handshake.  Like at the top of the key, when nothing's even going on, if you're not going to call guys karate chopping each other in their throats, that's your starting point guard's fourth foul. 
[01:19:30]  He's got to go sit down.  He's doomed.  Melissa, do you agree?  You've got to bring in that lesbian.  I agree.  Tyrone Lue.  It was pretty crazy last time.  Tell me that guy doesn't look like it's Teresa Webberstone from the New York Liberty.  Wow.  Daddy's one angry little rug muncher right there, Tyrone Lue.  Nice.  I don't even know what color that kid is.  He looks like a woodpile.  Jay Moore Rascals, Wednesday night in New Jersey. 
[01:20:00]  The party continues.  Jim Norton, who's there this weekend as well.  All right, Melissa, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I'll talk to you soon.  Bye.  Big up, Philly.  Philly, what's up?  You don't need rock and roll if you have Opie and Anthony, because Opie and Anthony brings you a rock and roll show in a comedy format.  Thank you, Jay.  You know, it's mine.  It's effing ponderous.  It's effing ponderous.  Ponderous.  People go, where's the music?  Like, you don't own the freaking CD already.  Rush, moving pictures. 
[01:20:30]  When am I ever going to hear Tom Sawyer if you take away my music?  Oh, you know what?  I could use that big thing that I stare at every night, and maybe I'll make it play like an ape staring at a monolith in the beginning of 2001.  Living a vida loca.  I'm pretty sure you own that one, honey.  All right, Jay.  This is the new party.  No, I'm just getting started.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony are better than any music you're going to hear.  And Philly, I'm telling you, I love the city. 
[01:21:00]  I play there.  I love the Sixers.  Heck, you know, I like that carpet that looks like it came up Jerry Jones' head that you use for AstroTurf in your new ballpark.  And for those Phillies with the blue dots on top of their hats.  Get a color scheme and stick with it.  Please.  They're wearing blue.  They're wearing gray.  They're wearing white.  They're wearing red, Norton.  The Phillies got eight different uniforms, Norton.  You don't know who you're rooting for.  What do I talk to Marshall down at the bus company?  The guy's got a blue dot on his head. 
[01:21:30]  I mean, we love the Philly fanatic.  We love everything.  Philly's a cool city, but I promise you, Philadelphia.  You're kissing a little too much ass.  No, I'm not kissing ass.  I'm saying, Philadelphia, when you listen to Opie and Anthony, don't play or hate.  Don't play or hate.  Don't play or hate.  Don't hate the game, yo.  Because the comedy gods, for some reason, smile on these two morons more than any two  people I've ever seen assembled in a room.  Rob, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  I wanted to see if you guys saw that guy Tyrone Lou.  Tell me he didn't look like Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, that's good.  Dead edge, man.  The Lakers, yeah.  Oh, yo, I was in Philly this weekend.  I was checking it out.  I saw a brawl go down right outside because this dude was wearing a Lakers shirt.  I was in West Philly.  It's not a very good part of town.  But I saw this black guy wearing a Lakers shirt, and he got in a brawl with a bunch of  other black guys.  Word.  You know, you just saw him in basketball, right?  Are you saying black on black crime is up in Philly?  Yeah.  Jay, Jay, you're a real queer, all right?  All right, fag.  Wow, there you go.  Jay, we're going to do the Motley Crue Challenge today. 
[01:22:30]  Don't look at me.  Look at this.  No, no, no, no, no.  The big double dong is here.  Anthony, you hold that thing like you're cutting sausage in back of Umberto's.  Isn't that great?  There you go.  Another eight feet.  It's about 18 inches long?  Yeah.  Sure.  Double dong dildo.  The Motley Crue Challenge.  We put some cash right in the middle.  Two girls back up into this thing.  I was listening to you guys, and I think the stakes are going to be higher than $300 because 
[01:23:00]  I knew I was coming in.  I cannot personally give any of my dividends to a double dong dildo with which two girls  to wrestle through their boxes with.  Right.  Because then I'd be contributing to the bandit.  Right.  But let's say Jim Norton needed like a $300 loan.  You know what I mean?  And then Norton puts it up.  I can look my wife in the face and say, I had nothing to do with it.  I was just there.  Let's just put it this way.  We'll have the money.  There'll be cold, hard cash around this.  Yes.  Then the cash will be hanging from the middle of it. 
[01:23:30]  First girl to get to the middle.  Wins the money.  Yeah.  Simple contest, right?  Mm-hmm.  Norton was at Boston Comedy Club, so he's got like 50 bucks.  Mendy.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Mendy.  Yes.  We've seen what you could take.  That's pretty big, that one I took, huh?  We've seen her be a beer cozy.  Mendy, let's, uh.  Yeah, she was a beer cozy.  And then some guy untapped it.  Jay, you've never heard this story?  No, I think I might puke up. 
[01:24:00]  She's, uh, she's standing on stage.  We were at a road show in front of like 2,500 people.  Yeah, this chick takes a beer can, a Bud beer can, puts it right there.  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  With the beverage still?  It's still, yeah, still, it hasn't been, uh.  It hasn't even been open yet.  Okay.  Because the other way, I think you might cut yourself.  Can just, Jay, can disappear.  I wouldn't even want to hazard a gas.  It's got crosswinds.  But then, but then, a guy comes up, opens up the can. 
[01:24:30]  It shoots all over his face.  Looked like, it looked like a mare going to the bathroom.  Swear to God.  For some reason, the guy opening the can and getting sprayed in the face disgusts me less  than the actual insertion of the...  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  The spraying was...  It was pretty bad.  Yeah, you guys allowed to say the other guy's name on the radio now?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  One of the guys from his show was, like, doing my act right in front of me at the Boston Comedy Club.  Really?  Craig Gass.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, hey, how you doing? 
[01:25:00]  And then he's on stage.  Oh, he's doing walking and stuff.  He closed with it.  Oh.  And I'm next.  In, like, literally 15 seconds, I'm next.  And you're walking.  I mean, you're the definitive walking.  You're walking and having sex with Elvis.  Like, I'm about to have sex with you.  And it's like, it's okay, the walking.  But, you know, you can't be doing walking when James Moore's in the room.  I don't know if it was disrespectful or if he's just so out of the loop that he doesn't know protocol enough.  So I just went up as walking.  Oh, you did?  Did you blow his walking away?  Yeah, but the crowd was really freaked out, like, uh, uh. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Great.  Got you, dude.  We thought he was here, too.  Oh, no.  You know what I want to see?  I want to see Jay and Craig Gass do the Motley Crue Challenge as walking.  Mendy.  Yeah.  I bet I can put a beer can in my snout.  It's crazy, this watch.  He knew that was the only place for gooks when I looked for it.  Diarrhea, dysentery, nothing.  The father from hiding from those yellow, flat-faced monkeys. 
[01:26:00]  Mendy.  Yeah?  Let's touch the chase.  You coming in to do this or what?  I am about five minutes away.  I'm over on 9th and 56th, so I'll be there.  All right, we need one more girl to do it.  Oh, we got nothing.  Hold on, hold on.  We might have another girl.  Hold on.  Oh!  Hold on.  This is more important than talking to Christopher Walken right now.  Carmine.  Carmen.  Carmen, what's up?  Yeah, Carmine wouldn't work, wouldn't it?  Hey, I want to do the challenge.  Go home.  Sounds like a big girl.  Sounds like a big girl. 
[01:26:30]  Carmen.  Yeah.  You want to do it?  Yeah, I'll do it.  Where are you?  I'm about 157th.  Get that ass right down here.  Oh, okay.  How big is your ass?  Yeah, she's got to be a sister, right?  Carmen?  Hmm?  How big are you?  I've got a size 14.  Perfect.  Look at Norton.  He's happy.  Nice.  Are you a black woman?  No.  White woman?  Yes.  White man.  Black woman.  Black baby.  Guys. 
[01:27:00]  Game on.  Game on.  Carmen?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We will give you explicit directions.  Carmen, we hate when people blow us off, so if anything happens, you've got to call us  back and tell us that you're not going to make it.  So we can get a new girl.  This is going to be the showstopper today, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Go talk to Carmen.  We should have round robins and semifinals.  Get a lot of girls, you know?  Maybe like the U.S. Open.  Well, a big wide open bracket in the beginning.  We'll accept more girls.  Mindy.  Hey.  We'll see you in a little bit, okay?  Yeah.  I'm right outside. 
[01:27:30]  I'll be up in a minute.  All right.  Can't wait.  Okay.  Bye, guys.  Hey, did you bring your panties?  Yes, I did.  I'm wearing them.  I've been wearing them all day.  All right.  We'll get into that story next.  Pretty flowered brief.  All right.  Hold on.  Should let everyone know how big Mendy is.  Do we have the song?  We should play the song for everybody.  Yeah, let's play the song.  There's a song that just really, really lets everybody know what Mendy's all about.  Mendy is the editor of Big Butt Magazine.  Yeah.  If you've ever seen Big Butt Magazine, she's the gal.  She's in charge of the whole stream.  I actually love the stories about when they're at work and the guy just starts cleaning the 
[01:28:00]  junkyard for the lady in the next.  Fat love.  Yeah, yeah.  Fat love.  Tasted like a roll of pennies in an evening chair.  Have you met Mendy before?  No, but I've got a year for a tree.  I heard she can haunt a house.  She's huge.  But she's got to be because she can't be a Big Butt Magazine editor and not have a big  butt.  So she walks them walk and talks the talk.  She's in the damn magazine every month.  She's got various things happening and things going places. 
[01:28:30]  She's like a club owner when she runs at a con.  She's like, all right, just take a picture of my ass.  I'll be on the toilet.  Hurry.  Any other ladies want in, just give us a call.  All right.  I get a great fecal story that happened to Scott Wolfe.  Hold on.  We've got a celebrity one for Scott Wolfe.  Celebrity one.  Wait, wait.  We've got to take a break.  No, no.  I meant for later.  A tease.  No, that's good.  I like that.  And also, you want us to...  All right.  Again.  I'm just waiting in case they dump out of that.  In case they dump out of that.  We'll play Toretta's Four House.  We'll fill in a little bit.  Here's the Mendy song as we go to break. 
[01:29:00]  And we've got to talk to Steve about his back waxing next.  We'll play Toretta's Four House.

I weigh 235  Oh, my bad  My bad  No, it's the shoes  That's not a slimming  You know, you're wearing like overalls  That's not a slimming outfit  It's the stripes  If you had vertical stripes  I'd be like 180  You know, maybe  But I'm saying like  You're very attractive  They're telling me you're a really large gal  But then when they said you edited Big Butt Magazine 
[01:36:30]  They said at least she walks the walk, you know  And you're very attractive  Well, thank you very much  I'd let you show your non-gag reflex on me  It's cute, too  Really?  Uh-oh  That's a surprise to me  No, no  Is that a fat girl thinks I'm cute?  Well, see, now  See, now  Mandy, are you going to show the lack of gag reflex with that thing?  Yeah  With what thing?  Do we have a condom?  Not you, Jay  Do we have a condom?  Have you ever done the whole set?  Pull out your grape condom

Steve from foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com  He threw the double-dong dildo at me  And hit the expensive equipment  That was like a javelin  Now Mr. Leonard with sports  Hey, Steve  Yeah 
[01:39:00]  What's up, man?  What's up?  Well, Rick kind of spilt the beans on something  Well, yeah, actually  Wait, do you want to talk about that picture or not?  Yeah, we're going to do all of this  Get Rick on mic, too  Because Rick  Rick  Rick  Rick told everyone that Steve is having his back waxed  Well, not having  Did it, did it  Oh, you did it?  It took two sessions over the course of two weeks  Because it was extremely painful  It was  How hairy is your back? 
[01:39:30]  I'm half Italian, half Lebanese  So that's  All Lebanese, too?  That's throw rug material  No wonder you are the nastiest, angriest drunk ever  Oh, I was wondering about that  Wow  Yeah, it's awful  So it's  And I have a really big tattoo on half my back  So  And I haven't been able to see it for like  About six months  Because of the underbrush  Yeah, exactly  So you got it waxed  Was this on anyone's prompting?  Or did you just look at your back one day and go  No, this was  I just looked at myself and said  I can't really see this chick's face on my back 
[01:40:00]  Because  Yeah  Because she's got hair growing through it  But why bother?  It's just going to grow back  Hopefully it will grow back finer  At least that's what I was hearing  So anyway  I convinced myself that I could withstand  Having hair torn out of my back  Did you go to someone or do it yourself?  You did it at home with Mujan  Oh, no  Oh, man  It was  Mujan makes  Makes pre-wax  Makes pre-waxed  Strip  Plastic strips  That you can put on your back  I had to use four boxes  Four boxes 
[01:40:30]  That's the Lebanese side  Yeah, thank you  Three for the Italian  One for the Lebanese  You got to ration it out  Not only  I had Mrs. Monacotti waxing  That jerk  Garrity was complaining  My back was two hands  When I say this is the most excruciating pain  I have ever felt  Really?  And then the anticipation  I'm having to do it 
[01:41:00]  Patient  Did you have your chick do it?  Yeah  Oh, my God  There's a sex move  Yes  You wax my back  And then get in the bedroom  Yeah  I went out of mighty  You're a simian, Steve  You know  Some people seduce people differently  Should we check out his back?  No, dude  Don't  I think we have to  Not even  Not even  Not yet anyway  Because it's really ugly  It broke out  Well, I don't want to see it  When it's not ugly  But  But that's okay  I mean  Dude, it's nasty  It's nasty  But we all have our crosses to bear here 
[01:41:30]  Yeah  I'd come in with my second nose growing on the side of my face  Yeah  And Opie would come in with the swamp lip  And we all have our crosses to bear  Steve  It's your turn in the barrel  All right, man  All right  You want to see this nasty thing?  I came in with a poon on my chin once  People were calling me Dudley Do-Right  And like this big thing sticking out  Steve, you going to be all right with this?  What?  You're going to be all right?  Dude, I saw it this morning  And it's friggin' nasty  Let's do it, right? 
[01:42:00]  Take a look  Yeah, it hurts  It really hurts  It hurts  Like 75 applications of wax  75 applications  Steve is a big boy, though  Yeah, exactly  That's it  All right  I guess you didn't do the belly, huh?  Ouch  What do you got?  Ouch  It looks like you got chicken pox  Isn't that nasty?  Wow  It's only on the side  Somebody put a fire out on your back with a traction  Wow  Steve, you can actually see where you placed the individual strips 
[01:42:30]  Yeah  And pulled  That's orange, Opie  Isn't that nasty?  You can see where you put the strips and pulled  Holy ass  The only reason I did the whole thing was because one hurt so much and I looked how ridiculous it was  Yeah  I said, it looks like I got burned really badly in one place  So I just asked, screw it, do the whole thing  I popped the Valium, got really drunk  Ah, there you go  And just sat on the bed and just let her tear the hair out of my bed  You should have put this on foundrymusic.com  You would have got some hits  What did you do with the strips?  Was it tolerable with the Valium and Boost?  It still hurt  It still hurt 
[01:43:00]  I was so doped up and incoherent, it still hurt  You have no throat  No, that didn't go throat  There it is, the C word  Thank you, Norton  Thanks, Jim  Boy, Steve, so you're hoping now it doesn't grow back  What if it does, just the way it was?  You ever going to do that?  Never again  No, no  Never, ever again  I wouldn't think so  Maybe I'll get that later  Steve, can I ask you a question?  What's up?  How long have you been a hairy guy?  Since I was 12 years old  Then why would you get a gigantic, like, guitar with a chick tattoo on your back if you walk around like an ape? 
[01:43:30]  Because, honestly, I was  Oh, yeah, honestly  I was in Boston, like, deciding, and I was in a band at the time  My band was called Foundry  I said, screw it, I want to be in a band, I want to have a really cool tattoo  Got a chick with a guitar on my back  Did they have to shave your back to make the tattoo?  Yeah, absolutely  Wasn't that a warning flag for you, Steve?  Not at the time  Not at the time  I was a  Your jerk-off  Your chick tattoo has a beard  But I didn't see the top of it  It's actually a fantastic tattoo  Can I see the top of it? 
[01:44:00]  Because I just saw her legs  And part of the  It's like she's riding the guitar like a motorcycle almost  Yeah, it is a very  Nice piece, but  Dang  Wow  That's actually one of the better tattoos I've ever seen  It took five and a half hours to just get that thing done  You could have done one of those Yankee commercials  Remember the Yankee commercials?  Where they'd shave, like, the  Oh, yeah  The letters into the hairy guys?  Totally  Totally  You missed out on that  Oh, thank you  You know what you want to do, man?  You've got to show that back at Rascals 
[01:44:30]  On Wednesday night  I'll be with Jay at Rascals  Wednesday night in West Orange  And I'll be here for Friday  No, I do that too  Because I think  You might want to come to the Rascals Ocean on Sunday  Because I'm there as well  Hell, Steve could advertise your gig on his hairy back  I'll save it in my chest  Sell advertising on that thing  Right  I was 12  You said  There's always those kids that have got a lot of hair  And then you, like, take a week in front of them  When you're drinking beer on the golf course  You're, like, 13  Because I had, like, the  I had, like, not the Hitler mustache  But, like, the reverse 
[01:45:00]  Like, I only had hair on the sides  Of, like, my junk  And it was blonde  Like, I didn't have any  And I would go pee  And they'd be like  Oh, my God  Mutton chops  You know  I wasn't on my penis  It was the hair, like, where your pubic hair is  Jay has mutton chops in his pants  No, now I look like an elephant with a bad haircut  But I got, like, plenty of hair  You know, we actually have audio  Of Steve asking his girlfriend to wax his back 
[01:45:30]  What are the odds of that happening?  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh?  What?  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey, I did the same thing in my back 10 years ago  As a friend of mine, Kaz Maris  She ripped it all out  And all these little pimples  Where every single hair follicle was  And it hurt like a bastard  It's three hours  It took us three hours to do the whole thing  Did it come back finer, like Steve is hoping?  Heck no, man  If it all came back  He'll start seeing these little black hairs 
[01:46:00]  Start coming out about three days from now  That's the first person I've ever heard  That actually sounds hairy  That's funny  Ha ha ha  It's going to come back like brundle flies  Come in a mountain  I'm gonna can't let alone have a wheel  Brundle fly  Those big boy  Fly hairs  It's funny  Eat chocolate and bang your wife  Until she falls asleep  I have chitin  Well, Steve, very good  We should also tell everyone that Steve has Holly Berry topless on foundrymusic.com 
[01:46:30]  so you don't have to spend the money to see Swordfish.  Well, you said it to me, yeah.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Because a lot of people are going to see that movie just to see her topless.  We save you the money.  It's the way she plugged it on the MTV Movie Awards.  So come and see the movie and see my boobs.  Who's told Marlon and Sean Wayans make their annual Set the Race Back 20 Years appearance?  Well, Lordy, Lord, we got vaginas.  Joe Nutt!  Old Man River. 
[01:47:00]  You better see your Orphadonus.  What's wrong with Joe Nutt?  Yeah, you were the cape, sucker.  Lordy, Lord, let's be tears.  You won't find we're here.  These are guys that have their own show.  Two black men in a lineage of hilarious black family, right?  They get their own black writers, their own black producers.  They control it.  It's the freaking Wayans Brothers show, it's called.  It's on the black network called the WB, which stands for We're Black. 
[01:47:30]  Yes.  And what are they doing in their own show?  What are you guys doing?  Like your brothers must be, if your brothers were dead, they'd be rolling over in their graves.  Literally, people would say that.  Which brother put on Living Color?  Kenan.  Kenan, now there's a guy, now there's a guy, funny guy, very, I don't know, classy in the comedy.  Very classy.  These two now.  Damon, who said to Eddie Murphy, Beverly Hills Cop 2, you can have them in the name. 
[01:48:00]  Remember that?  You can have them in the name.  And the entire theater went, who is that guy?  Yeah.  He had the bunny, he was on crack in colors.  I just want my bunny.  And now you got...  Remember that?  Yeah.  That was a great, you know...  Step and fetch it.  Saturday Night Live cast member, and now you got...  Ah, look at my butt.  Just dial down the middle, sucker.  1-800-COLLECT.  1-800-PAY-ME. 
[01:48:30]  Please use the T when you're dialing.  1-800-COLLECT.  When dialing, use the T.  All right, Steve, thank you.  Where can they find the Hallie Barry?  How can they find your back hair?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, what they do with all the hair when you rip it out, when your girl ripped it out.  Honestly, it's stuck to 75 Mahjong seats.  You can just use it as like Mahjong tile in the band, tile the bathroom with it.  I want these tribbles off the bridge.  Yeah.  What a mess. 
[01:49:00]  Tribbles.  I always forget tribbles, and I say fribbles by accident, like a retard from Friendly.  Remember they had the fribbles?  What?  Friendly shakes have gotten into the grains of blood.  Ribble.  Speaking of Star Trek, I can't believe, so you just don't have these big things of hair  laying around your house?  No, no, I threw them out.  Oh, okay.  What's the garbage?  You're a tax determined?  Wow, I thought this guy had something to do with radio.  Awful looking.  When you see like a five inch by five inch chair, all your thick black hair. 
[01:49:30]  Somebody's got some odd hobbies in that house.  Keep driving.  This is going to be a Sheen brother movie in a minute.  Wow.  All right, where's the clip?  It's, uh, the link is right on the front.  Either that or the scene out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers when the garbage truck came by  to pick up the hairy mess that was left after the pod transformation.  It's fantastic.  They're all looking at the window.  The dust and hair just coming out of the back of the garbage truck.  You know, I've got a great question, Anthony.  Yeah.  What bin do you put that in?  To recycle the hair. 
[01:50:00]  Because you've got blue for recycling in L.A.  You've got green for like shrubbery.  Hazardous waste.  And leaves.  The biohazardous bag.  The black one is for the trash.  We sound like a wacky A.N. duo.  What bin do you put the hair in?  Hey, watch, I shave my back.  Mark Redgeladick was over my house.  A good geladick backwards pulls mash bill if you want me.  And Mark Redgeladick's on a hay.  I figure it was actually Phoebe Cates started whacking my back. 
[01:50:30]  Bob Murphy had a cocktail in a Schweppes ginger ale back.  Because he was watching his figure.  I had a sour stoner got up to me.  Where is Bob Murphy?  I just shave with my own tongue like a cat.  And occasionally cough up a hairball.  How about that, Philly fans?  Bob Murphy's dying in a hospital.  I'm already dead.  And we mock each other.  That's fantastic. 
[01:51:00]  Hideki, uh, Rabu, Aruba.  We've got a pitch for the Montreal Expos.  He pulled his belly rounding third in a race riot.  Out of your mind.  How about that shin guard in the American League?  Just getting soon-izing the ball.  Cutting it, dicing it, and slicing it to all fields necessary to make himself already have close, 
[01:51:30]  if not over exactly a hundred hits on the button.  Ooh, wow.  Thank you.  Oh.  Seems to be a fire on the mind.  Margaret Zlatik's a handsome fellow.  Butch Husky, not so handsome.  Firemen rush out to douse the blaze with some kind of ABC gas or chemical.  Butch Husky's a black man with freckles, which I can't figure out. 
[01:52:00]  You'd think a black person or someone with extended melanin in their jean pool would somehow be immune  to red-headed, freckle-faced things.  But not the black man named Butch Husky.  The fire's out with play ball.  Strike one to Luis Gonzalez, who leads the league with five home runs today.  Harry Carey.  Who knew he was still alive?  And little Nicky. 
[01:52:30]  I don't know what that guy's talking about, but he's freaking me out because he's from the grave.  Ken Morton, please rent little Nicky.  Bob Murphy sounds like he belongs next to my father.  And he doesn't talk often, so I have to tell time to one different people.  Sorry, you can't talk now.  The phlegm is backing up.  Thanks, Bob, for that crystallized insight. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, Nicky, you're from hell.  Did you ever ruin it to Alfonso Sarriano, that hot, black young Yankee that looks a lot like a crow?  Where's his stocking's eye?  It looks like he should be on the front yard holding some type of lantern or lighting device.  How does a fire keep relighting on the pitcher's mouth?  Maybe it's the rosin bag.  I've never understood.  What does it say, a rosin bag? 
[01:53:30]  I've never heard of rosin before baseball.  You never bump into somebody and say, let's go get some rosin.  You doing anything tonight, little Nicky?  Why don't you come by?  Mark Roods Atlantic and that Bush Husky will stop by and we'll have some rosin.  Looks like Roger McDowell lost part of his handcuffs to that brush fire that again is creeping through them.  I've been doing that fire with my mind. 
[01:54:00]  I didn't know you could start fires that way.  Philadelphia's wondering, hey, what happened to this show?  Hey, Ryan Sandberg is being mounted by a fan.  I've never seen anything like it.  There's a double down the line, left field.  Look at Ryan.  It's almost like he expected to be mounted by that young man in the fifth row who's now deep in the center field.  And Ryan Sandberg, wow, look at Ryan O'Gal. 
[01:54:30]  You know, he retired.  Then his wife took about $80 billion from him and castrated him some bloodbath of a divorce.  And then he had the gall to come back for the love of the game for the league, minimum.  Hell of a guy as the fan finishes up on his back.  And Rick Russell wants a turn on Ryan O'.  Ball one to Luis Gonzalez.  Excuse me.  Excuse me. 
[01:55:00]  That's Robin.  Robin Vincera.  He's left.  He's all working hard.  Harry, can we, um, can we play free?  Jay Moore will be at Rascals this Wednesday.  That's all you need to know.  Now, West Orange, right, Jay?  Hey!  Right, Jay?  I am around.  Jay?  Yes, sir.  Jay, back to Earth.  God, he gets in the zone, doesn't he?  Harry Terry will be with us for the rest of the show.  West Orange, Rascals on Wednesday, Jay?  West Orange, Wednesday, and I'm bringing Jim Norton and, uh...  It's going to be a great show.  And, uh... 
[01:55:30]  Holy ass.  We went to the Black Crow Saturday night.  Yeah, all right.  We'll get into more stuff.  We've got to take a break.  Jim Norton's in a...  We need to breathe.  We need to breathe.  I like breathe.  Okay, listen.  Have a breathe with one lung at one time.  I learned it in a transcendental yoga class.  I was taking an hospital and I was taking in the film festival in 1990.  That's when Goodfellas was nominated about a bunch of Italians that shoot each other up  and whatnot.  Hey! 
[01:56:00]  All right, listen.  Listen.  The other girl is minutes away to do the Motley Crue Challenge with your butt, Mendy.  Yeah.  Steve, foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  The Halle Berry clip is right on the front page.  Yeah.  So you don't have to pay money to see Swordfish.  You can see your top list if you go to that website for free, okay?  Holy ass.  As we take a break...  Rick Russell, scale working.  All right.  Jay wanted us to play this bit for Philadelphia today.  Oh, Philly, brace yourself.  This is a guy with Tourette's calling a whorehouse in Vegas because he's going to be on a little business trip, okay? 
[01:56:30]  Right.  Rock on.  And we'll be back.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  Do you need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100 for a basic one activity party.  $100.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon. 
[01:57:30]  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  So I can come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Okay.  So for $100, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone. 
[01:58:00]  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy,  I can get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take...  MasterCard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind a... 
[01:58:30]  When I start...  Cheat vibe that spanks me...  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  Take your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have jungle fever.  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies. 
[01:59:00]  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy.  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:59:30]  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Anthony Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  Opie, you had this done.  Giving the gift of sight, yes.  Quite a while ago now.  It's been over a year, right?  I think so.  And your vision now, 2015.  2015, better than 2020.  Dr. Philotoff at Diamond Vision.  He's done over 6,000 surgeries.  Went to Harvard and Yale.  Who has time for that?  Dr. Philotoff treated Lawrence Taylor, Tiki Barber.

Both of these guys playing Rascals and West Orange on Wednesday night.  Roy.  And I'm also there Friday and down south Sunday.  Don't confuse Opie.  What?  With the different club dates. 
[02:01:00]  The last thing Opie wants to hear is that you're at two different rooms on two different nights.  Keep it simple, Norton.  Well, no, the listeners get confused.  I don't care.  Plug whatever you want.  They'll just start showing up all over the place trying to figure it out, though.  That's all.  Is that your Palm Pilot, Norton?  Yes.  Is that a Palm Pilot?  I lost one and I had to buy another one.  I was imagining the evidence in that.  And then I took her throat and crushed a windpipe as I did it from behind.  I have the name and the age in parentheses.  You guys were talking about fecal stuff before. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know if you want to get back on it.  Well.  Opie told me a funny story about that.  Can I just say something really fast, though?  Yeah.  Because I just got really distracted.  Yeah.  Second girl has shown up for the Motley Crue Challenge.  Yes.  Yes.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Opie has a look of sheer terror.  Nice.  No, that face.  Nice.  You're going to rean it.  You're going to rean it.  Don't rean it, Jay.  It's in anticipation.  I can't wait.  It's going to be good.  Of course it is.  It's squeamish.  We'll get into that in a few minutes. 
[02:02:00]  Six o'clock hour, we'll do the Motley Crue Challenge.  The double dung's running like a roach in the light.  Where is it?  Where is it?  It's a veer.  And what's her name?  Mendy?  She already put her grape condom on it, and she showed me she doesn't have a gag reflex.  Nice.  Well, there she is with it.  But it activated mine just looking at it go down that floor.  Did you see being a poor double dung dildo thinking, wow, I'm going to get a couple  of lipstick lesbians going at it, and this is what you have to deal with?  Hey, there she is with her grape condom.  It's a very tasty grape condom. 
[02:02:30]  Mendy tries to talk sexy.  Hey, wow.  Wow.  She does talk sexy.  That girl is hot on the radio.  She's got a hot voice.  Man.  It's like most female jocks.  She does talk to do the, you know, the 1-900 lines.  You'd make out me.  You'd make a great female radio job.  Yeah?  Yeah, you fit all the criteria.  You've got the hot voice and the big, fat body.  You're perfect.  It's happened to everyone.  You hear the sexy voice on the radio.  You go to an appearance, and you're disappointed.  You just got to come up with a good name that sounds hot and sexy. 
[02:03:00]  Like Mendy Pete?  About Man Cow.  She could be Woman Cow.  No, because that's a hot, sexy name.  Oh, that guy's got it.  Mendy, just go Love Songs.  I was more making fun of how stupid the name was.  Go on.  Thank you, Jen.  Love Songs at Night with Mendy.  Hello?  Love Songs at Night with Mendy.  Oh, hey, that would work.  Go ahead, intro.  Intro of the show.  Let's hear what it sounds like.  Do your best, chick. 
[02:03:30]  Dumber than a bar.  So dumb and blonde today.  Oh, man, you're cold.  You know the blood that has to run that body?  There's not much for the brain, Opie.  You've got to understand the physics.  He's standing around.  That's a lot of energy.  I know.  That ass alone's got to be about 20 pints.  So it's right.  Her body looks like a Down syndrome head.  You better watch out of the insects against you.  We describe Mendy's body this way. 
[02:04:00]  It looks like there's a midget inside trying to punch his way out.  She looks like Ernie from the clumps.  Oh, my God.  Is that supposed to happen?  Oh, it's so great.  The top of the Taj Mahal.  You know, after seeing the two contestants for the Motley Crue Challenge, I'm thinking we  should do this with a six-foot hero instead.  Or a fire plug.  All right, go ahead, Mendy.  Show us your...  She's got a condom rolled down on half of a double-doned dildo. 
[02:04:30]  That's about 18 inches long.  All right, let's see this.  Let's see this.  Say goodbye to grape condom, gentlemen.  I saw this trick.  She's looming it up a little with her own mouth.  Look at that.  It's hot to check out.  It's going straight down.  Oh, my God.  I saw this in a movie once.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, what's with the little gag?  Her eyes are watering like Norton likes it.  I just want to know, why did you have to bite off Bo Derek's leg? 
[02:05:00]  Look at...  I'm, like, losing my voice from this.  You're losing your voice from taking that thing?  Isn't that a shame?  Losing my appetite.  It went about seven inches down.  Yeah.  That wasn't seven inches, honey.  Trust me.  That was...  That was...  Four.  No, my hand is...  No, look at that.  Seven inches.  Well, you got the condom all rolled up like a bad porno.  At least unroll it.  I...  Ever seen when they do double penetration, they're both wearing condoms.  Yeah, that's odd.  They're rubbing together.  They get the traction.  Their velvet crown royal bag just slapping together. 
[02:05:30]  You're like, oh, this is exactly what I want when I'm home alone with my garbage in my hands.  I hope someone comes in right now and sees me staring at two guys rub their crown royal bags together.  I didn't even see a woman in between them.  I was watching a DP over the weekend on some bad cable channel, and it takes...  It's horrible.  The family channel?  Yeah, the family channel.  It's horrible.  I like it.  No, I got a new cable, digital cable. 
[02:06:00]  I got like 650 channels now, and I can't find...  She's gagging over the coin.  I thought you didn't have a gag reply.  Just make believe it's a hero.  I thought about her reading her own magazine.  Gagging at the woman.  That would be big, bud.  I was considering the possibilities by Unzut Your Fly.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  She'd fight it.  What?  No, she wouldn't fight it.  She'd be good to it.  She'd respect it.  What are you saying, Anthony?  Oh, I'm watching this bad porno on this.  You know, you figure you're paying money for cable.  If I want to rent a porno on the cable, you know, it costs like six bucks or whatever 
[02:06:30]  it is, I want to see porno.  I don't want to see the spanked revision crap you get in the hotel.  I don't want to see the softcore versions of hardcore films, the other edit where they  don't quite pan down to see the action going on.  Did you see the guy having an appendectomy, and this guy just looks like he's having his  appendix out?  That's it.  I couldn't take it.  You said you watched the double penetration.  Yeah, so it's this girl has a strap-on, and a guy is doing the same girl. 
[02:07:00]  You know, the girl's doing the strap-on from behind, and the guy's doing the standard version,  double penetration.  But they're not showing anything below the waist.  What's the use?  What good is it?  So all you get are the shots of the guy's face going, oh, he's playing Parcheesi between  her legs for all, you know.  Yeah.  And then you can tell some of his stuff, the side shots, but the guy's not even lined up  for the back door.  He's much too high on it.  You know they're not even really doing it.  I was completely...  Lopping his brow in the hallway. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  Completely turned off.  That's how you know you're a porn addict, though, when you start noticing camera angles.  I didn't like it.  The editing and the gas...  Yeah, I got one.  The lighting was bad.  I got three porn channels in LA.  Four.  Hardcore?  One of them is hardcore.  It's called the Hot Zone or the Hot Net.  But they show condomless sex with, like, they make maps of Hawaii on each other.  See, I don't want condoms in that either.  I don't care if they're healthy.  I don't care if they drop that aid to the next day.  I want to see my porno. 
[02:08:00]  Condomless.  No, it's because they don't want to get pregnant.  Oh, is that what it is?  How do you know, Jack?  Because they're clean.  They're porn stars.  Nobody ever touched them.  They're virginal in the snow.  They're Amish, for crying out loud.  How many uncles were inside them before they hit the studio?  Come on, of course they're wearing condoms.  I don't want to get any diseases or any incest from you.  I don't want to catch that incest that drove you to do porno.  I hate that.  I want to be the best.  Stay in the condom porn moods.  I took a porno backseat at a condom in it. 
[02:08:30]  You what?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You need the flesh-on-flesh money shot at the end.  I want a filthy pig that likes it that way.  Right.  Facial.  The girl that's getting into it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The girl.  And when I see guys that can't get their wood up, I'm like, I take it right back.  No, these guys.  These guys.  What do they do for a limb?  Yeah.  It's like going into a deli and seeing a guy that can't make a sandwich.  You know?  This is it.  It's your job.  It's your job.  Do it.  That's exactly what it's like.  Do it.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Excuse me.  Cisco and Ebert.  Can it be Christopher Walken and Anthony, please? 
[02:09:00]  Why?  Jesus.  We're reviewing that.  Anthony, you're reviewing porno.  Where do you live?  Bay Ridge, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  You've got to move to Sheetson Bay and get cable vision.  That's what I do.  I'll uproot myself and move for better porno.  You're not mad.  You're not a special penetration.  Like an old Mayan.  You'll just pick up your tents and move across the desert.  Don't get me wrong.  There's a library of porno that rivals any smut shop you could find in the country in our office.  That's what I was going to say.  So I could take them home. 
[02:09:30]  But I figured I had this 650 channels of cable.  I figured at any given moment, if I was so inspired, I could get some porno.  And no, I get crap porno.  I purposely sometimes drive past the video store because I know I can punch, like, two.  What I like to do is I get the Playboy channel for free.  Yeah.  Right?  And then I punch up, like, the next two channels of porno.  Because now I've got three going in a row.  So I do the close-up of the guy's, like, ass.  You're off it.  I'm off.  Right?  And I go back and forth.  But what happens is I went to rent one and it said, you know, for customer service, call extension 732. 
[02:10:00]  And I told my wife, I'm like, well, how come I'm not getting any porno?  And my wife goes, I apparently maxed out the porno.  But I have a dish and I pay for my dish and I pay my bills on time.  You only get a certain amount of porno.  Apparently, you get enough where they think you might have a problem and they've got to stop it for you.  It's like gambling.  Yeah.  This guy's cranking wet.  But what they don't understand is I'm watching three at the same time.  Right.  So if I do, like, three, you know, max of Hawaii a day into my carpet because, you know, I'm just laying around doing nothing. 
[02:10:30]  Sure.  That's nine movies.  That's $10 a pop.  That's $90.  That's every day.  Before you know it, you're broke because you've got no more mule juice.  Mendy.  All right.  Why don't you leave the studio and get ready for the Molly Crude.  Yeah.  Zero.  We'll bring the other girl in and talk to her a little.  The other girl after commercials.  Jay wanted to tell the Scout Wolf crap story.  Oh.  What's wrong, Mendy?  She's jamming a thing in her freaking mouth and it's disgusting. 
[02:11:00]  Jamming and Rixman.  I was enjoying it.  I, you know, didn't get enough last night.  I don't think you could ever get enough.  Really?  You got to wait for Fred Flintstone's car to tip over.  That's when you're done.  I don't even know what it means and it's funny.  It sounds funny.  Yeah, right.  I was just going to say, am I being blonde again?  Yeah.  I'm going to get back under an oil derrick.  Just being able to do the trick.  Just being fat.  Die, get in the coffin.  Die, die, get in the coffin. 
[02:11:30]  Wait, Ben has a problem.  Turn the mic around, Ben.  You got a problem now.  You can't hold the mic.  You just fell off.  You're a drunk Irishman.  Where's the microphone?  I can't find the microphone.  Oh, it's the thing in my mouth.  The stool busted.  All right.  Whatever.  Ben was...  If my face is on the mic, it can't be on my Guinness.  Ben's just annoyed with Mendy.  What the ook? 
[02:12:00]  Scott Wolf crapping.  Oh, Scott Wolf.  Or a crap story.  Whatever.  You two were flaming fags in the movie.  Go.  First of all, I see him at the Black Crowes concert.  He's the next row over.  Oh, yeah?  And we hug in the middle of the aisle.  And as I hug him, I go, everyone in the entire theater just went, they are gay.  Faggy.  Yeah.  Oh, they are.  Look, they're hugging.  They're hugging Norton.  Garrity.  He don't know how to hug nobody.  I know how to hug somebody.  Come in.  That would be Eddie Murphy's joke. 
[02:12:30]  Scott Wild Mouth.  Fence the blouse.  Mr. Favisham.  What is this?  If you think I'm doing this play, it's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Do that again, Mr. Cramden.  That grace the poise you walk in.  Mr. Favisham.  Favisham.  Favisham.  Home a little early, eh, Garrity?  Would the saloon burn down?  It's a loud mouth, Garrity.  I'm taking you to all the Hong Kong gardens. 
[02:13:00]  I set my watch by Hong Kong gardens.  They take out the trash at five.  They're open for dinner, eh?  It's Sunday.  Scott Wolf had his wisdom teeth pulled, all four of them.  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Ziggy.  Yeah.  And they gave him, what's the pink?  Vicodin.  Vicodin, the new hottest drug in Hollywood.  So he's enjoying his Vicodin.  You know what I mean?  He's like, why take one when there's a whole bottle here?  How long do I want to be on these? 
[02:13:30]  Not long, but while I'm on them, let's have a good time.  Right.  So he realizes one day he's got a crap, you know, and he goes to the toilet and nothing  happens.  And he goes back to the couch and he's like, that's strange.  I really thought I had to crap.  And it happens like three times that day.  The next day it happens with incredible eruption urgency, like sweat pouring down the face on  on the bowl, like something bad is going to happen to him.  Right.  And so he goes back to the couch again.  And literally like 18 trips later, he calls his mother who works at a pharmacy and is 
[02:14:00]  dating the pharmacist who prescribed the Vicodin.  And he goes, Mom, I'm trying to do it and I can't.  You know, she's trying to do number two and it's not coming out and it's like a brick  and it's like lodged in his cavity.  And he feels like something, you know.  And she says, well, Jerry said, have you been taking the laxatives as well?  And he's like, what are you talking about?  Well, when you take a lot of Vicodin, apparently it's, you know.  Backs you up.  Backs you up.  And he's been taking like the whole bottle on like a, you know, a six-day little Vicodin  bender.  You know, why not?  Who wouldn't? 
[02:14:30]  So Jerry, his stepfather, her boyfriend of the mother, who's a sweetheart, by the way,  she's a sweetheart, sends over a laxative.  And he goes, okay, what's the laxative going to do?  And Jerry's mother goes, hold on.  She goes, what's the laxative going to do?  She comes back to the phone and she goes, he said it's going to cause an explosion.  So he says, I'm not doing the laxative.  At this point, like, they're like, okay, we're ready to act, you guys.  I'm like, I'm not going anywhere until I hear the end of this story.  He's looking for things in the bathroom. 
[02:15:00]  He has to carve it out somehow.  He figures out.  Stop it.  Like, get in there and there's no other way.  He thinks if he reduces it into pieces.  Right.  He gets a nail clipper.  Come on.  Stop.  Scott, I know you're in town.  You live in New York now.  You should be listening to O.P. and Anthony anyway.  Oh, my God.  Scott Wolf, West Orange's own Scott Wolf.  Home of Rascals.  Jim Norton and Jay Moore.  West Orange, New Jersey.  Wednesday night.  Don't even bring up those.  Nail clipper.  I don't mention Friday either.  He took the thing that you clean out under your nail with, that little part that you're 
[02:15:30]  not sure what to use for.  Yeah, yeah.  Not the clippy part, but the little part.  Right, the little part that swings out.  Well, apparently that's used for carving if you're on party.  You know, so he gets like a turtle head.  I'm going to choose my words so we don't understand.  Yeah, all right.  It's in there.  And he's carving it out.  He carves enough out that it starts to come out.  The head.  But there's still the entire Coca-Cola bottle behind it.  The Coca-Cola can behind it.  Right? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  So he's just sitting on the toilet.  That's the whole story.  And now what do you do?  Just keep carving and pray for rain.  I don't know what you do.  But that's got to be the worst one I've ever heard.  Carving it.  He said it's going to cause an explosion.  I want to hear it from Scott Wolf's mouth.  Scott Wolf.  But then I'll tell you that we saw the Black Crows.  All right, listen.  Chris.  We've wasted enough time.  And we've got to do the Motley Crue Challenge next.  Yeah.  We were talking about Steve, about his back hair and stuff. 
[02:16:30]  We found the Mujan live read.  Yeah, we used to actually do live reads for the product.  Commercial spin.  Steve used to take the back hair off his back.  And it was always, the biggest thing was how painless this product was.  Should you explain to Philly, the whole Otto and George phenomenon?  Phenom?  Phenom?  Otto's a guy.  He's a great ventriloquist.  Well, actually, he's a lousy ventriloquist.  His lips move all the time.  He makes life look like Mary Poppins.  Yeah.  And his puppet, George, is just the nastiest little piece of wood you'll ever see. 
[02:17:00]  Looks like Dennis Miller after a house fire.  Very angry, nasty, filthy-mouthed little puppet.  And he brings the puppet in on the show, which is ridiculous.  Remember they're reading the Inquirer in front of us?  And he talks, and he's just nasty.  And we were doing a...  Apuza!  Apuza!  That's George.  Apuza!  We were doing a read for this Mujan thing, and he starts chiming in.  Pussy!  Pussy!  And we lost this client.  Yeah.  We really did. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, that was it for Mujan.  Trying to do the library for this Mujan, painless...  With Otto and George in the studio.  Painless hair remover, and Otto and George were in the studio, and we lost the client.  This is how it went.  It's pretty funny, from the O&A archives.  Uh-oh, I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial.  Anthony?  Yes.  Mujan.  Mujan.  You want to explain to George the puppet what Mujan is?  Mujan is a wonderful way for women to get rid of unwanted body hair.  Bikini line, legs, even mustaches, facial hair that girls might have, and it's so much 
[02:18:00]  better than shaving.  Nipple hair, whatever.  It leaves the body very smooth.  Mujan.  Is that like electrolysis?  Uh, no.  It's a strip that comes in a package in Mujan 2000.  You press it on, and peel it off, and, uh, completely smooth.  Wonderful, smooth, sexy skin.  The name is smooth.  It's basically yanking pubic hairs out. 
[02:18:30]  Mujan.  Should be called...  Ah!  Oh!  You know, we just spoke at the people from Mujan.  Yeah.  We had a demonstration in our office.  It is quick, painful, and, uh, completely removes hair.  Do you have a hairy knish?  Try Mujan.  Here's you.  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this.  Yanking my t*** ears out by the roof, so I look good in a sundress. 
[02:19:00]  Ugh.  Ah!  You should be called...  Ah!  Oh, sorry.  Yankee, wait, wait, that line has to be on the radio.  Oh, it's great.  Thank you.  It's easy.  Peel, press it off, uh, press it on, and pull it off.  Unwanted hair, gone.  Almost painless.  No.  Get to the part where you...  Ah!  No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate the skin.  Mujan, gentle, has botanicals, hypoallergenic, removes hair completely, it's slow to grow back. 
[02:19:30]  Lighter, thinner, skin is softer, sexier than before.  Mujan.  It's wonderful.  You always throw that aloe in there.  There's aloe in there.  What is that?  I'm bleeding.  I need to go to a hospital.  There's aloe in there.  There'll be no blood from Mujan.  It's wonderful.  It's so gentle.  We saw a demonstration.  The hair comes off.  You don't even feel it. 
[02:20:00]  I know it's fine.  It's the most desirable way to remove hair.  You know what else is good?  Closing a storm window on your testicle is also good.  You know, for the hot weather.  All right.  Just drop a storm window on your tea bag.  There's aloe in that window.  You want some aloe to your testicle?  Mujan, the most comfortable way to remove hair at home.  Why pay those salon prices? 
[02:20:30]  Mujan removes hair completely.  It's available at Duane Reade, Harmon Cosmetics, Genovese Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus.  If you don't see Mujan, go to the store manager and say,  Hey, my girl's got a poodle in her lap.  I need Mujan.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  727.

[02:23:00]  Yeah.  I do believe it's time for that, huh?  Yes, it is.  We have our contestants.  Debuting a new game on the O&A show.  The Motley Crue challenge.  I want to thank Vince and Nikki for turning us on to this little game.  Yeah.  They came up with it.  Told us about it.  We said, hey, we're going to steal that.  So we have our double dong dildo.  Going to put some money in the middle of it.  And the first girl to reach the cash gets the cash. 
[02:23:30]  We've got to make sure it's right in the middle.  We need, like, a little piece of string or something.  Yeah, something that we know.  There's no cheating involved.  Or we can make a line or whatever it's going to take.  Well, we talked to Mendy from Big Butt Magazine.  She's here to do the challenge.  You know what we should do?  I think put a hat pin right in the middle.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Where's the other girl?  Carmen's here.  Carmen.  Very big girl with huge hooters.  Oh, yeah?  Huge, huge, huge hooters.  Where is she? 
[02:24:00]  Here she is.  How you doing?  What's up?  Wow, you look like a bigger version of the girl from the Blind Faith cover.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  A Blind Faith cover reference.  Thank you.  Wow.  Like, Jay Moore coming in.  And give respect to Opie for that one.  Thank you.  The Blind Faith cover.  You ever see that?  You might have.  No, I haven't seen that, so I have no idea what you're referring to.  Go to the back and make a paper airplane and come back in there.  You might have.  Oh, you got the cover.  Here it is, right there.  Look at that.  Wow.  Kitty porn for everybody. 
[02:24:30]  Nice.  Yeah, how did that get through back then?  Yeah, because I read the story.  This girl is like 14 on the cover of that.  Yeah, they had her older sister lined up for the shot, but then the mother said that the  older sister couldn't do it.  So the younger sister went up to the photographer and said, look, I'll do this.  Is this a true story?  Yeah.  Took the picture, and that's what they used.  I got to be honest with you.  It's always listed like top 20 all the time.  Yeah.  Don't care for it.  No, huh?  This cover?  No, the album.  No, I like the cover.  I like everybody involved, but just the album doesn't light my fire, you know? 
[02:25:00]  After I can't find my way home, where else are you going on this thing?  If you listen to traffic, after they do like...  The traffic's, you know, not bad.  Let me look at the cover.  Let go, Jim.  You're sweating.  Don't touch my hands when you look at pornography, you freak.  What are we going to do next, like, see your sack?  Have we played that game?  No.  I don't think I want to.  You go on the road with Norton, you'll learn it.  Carmen, you ready to do the Motley Crue Challenge?  I'm ready and waiting.  You're not nervous or anything?  How old are you?  I'm 19.  Do you wow with those things? 
[02:25:30]  No.  Daddy was bigger than that.  They are giant.  No, no, I mean you're huge.  Boobs.  Show your best.  When did you start developing?  Oh, my God.  You've never been underwater.  That is amazing.  If there's a shipwreck, people are going to be swimming towards your rack.  Nice.  Don't save me.  I'm fine here.  19.  How big are those?  38 double D.  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  I would say bigger than double D.  Yeah.  Those have to be bigger than double D.  Right, Mendy?  I could take off my bra. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, you should.  Yeah, maybe we could do that.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  Could we look?  They're not going to fall to the floor.  See the rack on Lola outside?  Doing that Houdini trick.  Wow.  Wow.  The shirt came off.  Now those.  Oh, my God.  Take it out right now, Norton.  Start touching it.  Norton, touch my penis.  Oh, my God.  Those are giant.  If you really want.  I just want to see how much they weigh.  They're very heavy.  I'm very not sure.  Those are way bigger than double D.  I'm going to get a weight on those.  36 double D, it says. 
[02:26:30]  36 double D?  Yeah, but wait, wait.  Let me tell you what's going on, though.  Wow.  They were squeezing out of that bra.  Yeah.  So, 38 double D.  No, they're very...  Yeah.  That's 36.  Yeah, you are notorious, man.  You're smooth, man.  This is one of those.  Wow.  The correct thing with stretchy bras.  Norton, give a weigh thing.  Can I weigh?  Let us know.  Is it sweaty underneath?  Is it sweaty under there?  A little.  It's warm.  Well, you get the...  Oh, Norton, give the lift.  Jim, put your head on it, like in the strip clubs.  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:00]  How much do they weigh, would you say?  36 pounds each.  No way.  Oh, my God.  This Jim.  Big.  Let go of them, Jim.  Using the F word.  It is nice and moist.  It's like I was rubbing Marvin Gaye's forehead.  That's how it feels.  Nice to be.  Did you...  Did you...  What happened?  Did you scratch yourself or something?  No.  Is that like a shark bite over there?  Where?  Underneath the right one?  Or someone scratched you really hard, like Gant just said?  Or just stretch ones?  Just stretch ones. 
[02:27:30]  Little stretchies?  Yes.  Those are fantastic breasts, baby.  They are great.  Thank you.  Wow.  You date a lot of black guys?  No, I don't.  No?  I've never dated a black guy.  Good for you.  I would like to date a black guy.  Ah, no.  Finally, a fat chick with dignity.  You would like it?  I think I would.  Really?  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  They'd love that ass.  The brothers love a big ass like that.  Bendy, you've got to feature her in Big Bud magazine.  Oh, here we go.  I already asked her, and I'm waiting for the answer. 
[02:28:00]  Can you give me an answer on her?  What do you think?  I'm not sure, exactly.  Maybe.  Well, maybe we could be the judge.  No, no.  I was just going to say, we need to see the ample assets before we can...  All right, we can be the judge and see if she can...  We'll be on audition for you right now for Big Bud Naga.  Carmen, how much do you weigh?  About 185.  Yeah, you know what?  85 of that is breast, honey.  Yeah.  She's actually the size of Mike DiNicola.  You take those off. 
[02:28:30]  Big.  Those are big, huge boobs.  They really are.  All right.  You're not even that overweight.  Well, you're very smooth, Jay.  That's nice.  That's a great pickup one.  You get safe a lot, don't you?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  You were just talking about posing in Big Butt Magazine, you know, and he just said that  black eyes would love your big, fat butt.  And I'm saying, you know what?  You know, you're not as big as Mendy.  No, but that's not saying much either, Jay.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, go get a feed bag and leave me alone.  Let's see the, let's see the, uh, the, uh, yeah, the caboose.  The rest of me?  Yeah.  Are you a natural redhead?  I bet you are, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Fire down below.  I think it's time for you to start to seriously consider this.  Oh, she's not wearing panties either, right?  She is.  She stripped them down quickly.  All right.  Let's see.  Look at that orange, bud.  Wait a minute.  You're shade.  No, she's not.  No, she's not.  Oh, wait a minute.  And it's glorious.  Let's see. 
[02:29:30]  We can't see.  It looks like the flag of Japan.  It's like a bright, wow.  Look at that.  That is completely, uh, red down there.  Yeah.  Would you really want to miss...  That's a redhead.  Would you squat down with that and pick up oats?  No.  No, I wouldn't.  Wow.  That's nice.  Close the window.  It looks like...  It's your soap.  Like, uh, the hair down there is so fine.  It's like you're shaved.  It's like you're shaved.  I can't stop staring at it.  That is so beautiful.  That is amazing. 
[02:30:00]  She's free with herself.  See, if I saw her, like, on the beach in a bikini, I'd want to have sex with her.  It looks like a Ronald McDonald got a hatchet out of the head.  Doesn't it?  That's nice, though.  Nice.  Looks like carrot bottom.  How come you're still dressed?  Yeah, what's up with that?  Trust me, you don't want to see Mindy naked.  I do.  She's dressed like an Amish woman and it's bugging me.  Take off your clothing.  It's bugging me.  Well, they're going to have to get naked for the Motley Crue Challenge, so...  I've never endorsed Mindy getting naked.  I never like it.  But there she goes.  Hey, you're a big girl. 
[02:30:30]  You know, I once read Big Butt Magazine, Krause, walking with Cecil Fielder when he played in Japan.  And I realized they must have thought he was Godzilla.  They're all the Asians, about 5'1", 110 pounds, soaking wet.  And it was an enormous black man.  Hi, I'm your first baseman.  Ah!  You should have seen the looks on their faces as he filled the door frame. 
[02:31:00]  Cecil Fielder.  Wow.  Mindy, now, Jim Norm, what do you think of that?  Releasing those huge...  Let's see the, you know...  I haven't been this turned on.  Lift up your belly so I can see it.  You know something, Mindy?  When you stand, you cannot see your intimate area.  Yes, you can from this angle.  You can?  Well, you're on the floor, though, Jim.  No, that thing is just...  Jim's under the glass table.  Like Danny Thomas, Jim.  Jim Norton's got a glass table set up.  That is completely covered with your belly. 
[02:31:30]  She told me that she had sex for six hours last night,  and she told me she's quite a contortionist.  Why don't you show us some of your little gymnastic moves?  Do you want to come over and help me?  No.  I'm a happily married man.  Man, Mindy, that belly's getting...  And you should know from listening to this program,  I don't ever hit on anybody.  You've got like a Chris Farley belly happening there.  What were you thinking?  And your father may have told you,  you can't see my vagina.  I don't know. 
[02:32:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Jack Squad!  Frank Kelly, I'm not here right now.  No, you're the more...  Is that poor on Regan?  Poor on Regan, no?  No?  Boy, you two are quite a pair.  You really are big.  Look at the nipples.  It looks like tater tots.  I am totally taking the edge of her boobs.  You should be.  Let me tell you.  Carmen...  I have bigger boobs.  I have bigger nipples.  No, Carmen has really nice boobs.  And she's got the complete fade that goes on. 
[02:32:30]  Like the nip color completely fades into the...  I like the slow fade on the nip area.  Nice.  Right, Jim?  Nice.  Jim?  I'd have sex with either one of them.  I have to be honest with you.  This has the sex appeal of a video I once rented  called Miscarriages to Country Music.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Terrific.  By the way, Mike, who just hung up,  I wanted to talk to him.  He goes,  Guys, I don't think Motley Crue had two fat girls  doing this ever.  No one in the crew.  They probably do this.  This is a very sexy thing they're going to do,  and I'm looking forward to seeing it.  So have fun.  Girls, how do you plan on doing this? 
[02:33:00]  Is it going to be on your backs,  facing each other with the intimates,  back to back?  You're going to back into it,  or are you going to...  I want to see him like scissor lock.  Scissor lock?  Like a jackknife.  A knife.  If they back into each other,  you'll just hear.  By the way...  Carmen, have you ever done lesbian stuff?  I'm bisexual.  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  Mendy, would you be...  So why don't you say it?  But I mean, there's no other way to say it. 
[02:33:30]  Hold on.  That's what dumping hats for, right?  We should do a round of lesbian for a day, too,  on the lesbian couch.  You want to do that?  The fat version.  Would you guys be into maybe having an intimate moment with each other?  As far as you girls want to go.  You know what, Mendy?  You look like Sybil Shepard.  You really have the exact same face as Sybil Shepard.  I'm the fat Sybil Shepard.  Whatever works for you.  However you got to get up in the morning, great.  I have actually been told that quite often.  After she ate Bruce Willis. 
[02:34:00]  If Sybil was getting her molars removed.  Hey, she just ate my hairpiece.  Bring the...  Welcome to the party, pal.  Let's bring the couch in.  You'll notice I wear a different wig in every film.  But I say the same thing.  But when guys are bald and they put on jackass wigs,  who doesn't know Sean Connery's bald?  It doesn't take you out of the movie when Sean Connery's got, like,  a rainbow wig on in, like, some movie.  You're like, I know he's bald. 
[02:34:30]  But, like, when Samuel Jackson puts on a red wig for a black guy in The Negotiator,  you're like, didn't I just see him bald two weeks ago in my VCR?  Didn't I just see him bald?  The black guy just blew orange hair.  Oh, I got...  So we got the...  All right, the couch is now in the studio.  Ba-na-ba-na-ba-na-ba-na-ba-na-ba-ba.  I have to say, these condoms are nice.  They're, like, really, really ultra-long for...  Well...  Good thing.  Rick, we got to make a mark in the middle of the thing that makes... 
[02:35:00]  There's actually...  There's a hump, a little hump thing.  We'll make sure it's actually...  All right, so, okay, the first girl to the start of that.  Yeah.  But we actually do need to measure to measure.  Here's the deal.  Mendy and Carmen are completely naked, and no one is aroused in the studio.  I'm aroused?  Isn't that amazing?  Are you kidding me?  Well, the boobs are nice.  I'm looking right at the, you know...  The bun?  I can't see, you know, someone has fup.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Ron from Jersey wants to know if he said Carmen or Cartman. 
[02:35:30]  I'm going to need you to whip the ball back in.  Okay, listen, we got to take a break, but they're ready to...  Will you do that for me?  ...to do the Motley Crue Challenge.  Show the inside.  Oh, this is curious.  Come on, for the ghost.  Wow.  I can't see.  Let me...  Whoa.  It's pierced.  It's pierced down there?  Wow.  Harpoon!  All right, we're going to take a break, and we'll do the Motley Crue Challenge  next for these two fine ladies.  Looks like when they shoot the bolts through the cow's head at the slaughter yard. 
[02:36:00]  Get in the coffin.  That lesbian couch is not going to be the same after this match.  It's going to be broken.  I know.  It's going to be like you live in Southie.  All the feet are off your couch.  You just rest on the floor.  One breaks, so you take the other three off.  Because we're from Southie.  Now put the couch on the curb.  Your father's coming home.  Save the parking spot.  Get the dining room cans and put them out on the curb so nobody parks in front of our  house, you re-cab.  Stop showing the rod through your hood to the people in the audience. 
[02:36:30]  All right, we're almost ready.  We'll do it next with these two ladies, okay?  All right.  The debut of the Motley Crue Challenge next.  And we're back.  Getting ready for the Motley Crue Challenge in the studio.  Mendy from Big Butt Magazine.  Yes.  And Carmen from Harlem. 
[02:37:00]  Right, Carmen?  Yeah.  Yes.  They're both naked and Jim Norton's head is in between their massive asses right now.  Stinky cameras up and working, Opie.  For a photo op.  Stinky cam.  You can get there through WNEW.com to take a peek of what's going on in the studio.  Yeah.  All right.  Jim, are you ready for the Motley Crue Challenge?  Yes.  Very ready.  How great would it be if Richard Harris just came in and started chasing him? 
[02:37:30]  Wait, Sal wants in real fast here.  Sal, what's up?  Guys, man, I've got to stop booking appointments at 6 o'clock.  I'm sitting out in front of these people's house.  I can't stop listening.  You guys are awesome.  Oh, thank you.  Jay is like wandering around.  I don't know if he wants to be in here right now for this.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Would he get in trouble?  Let's just say he's a little afraid.  Oh, my God.  Is Tony Danza coming in or not?  He's a little afraid.  Get Tony Danza in here.  Get Tony Danza in here for a second.  We love Tony Danza. 
[02:38:00]  Tony Danza was doing some radio upstairs on our AM.  Angela.  Will Tony Danza come in to see two?  It's easy to do the Motley Crue Challenge.  All right, they're just...  Yeah, go on the couch, girls.  Jay Moore is babbling to Tony Danza outside the studio.  That's really Tony Danza.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if he's going to come in for this. 
[02:38:30]  He's got to come in and see this.  Rick's begging.  Rick's begging and, like, give him the sign, like, no, don't worry.  You won't be in any pictures.  No one will ever know you were in the studio.  Of course not.  Well, make believe you weren't in there.  Don't worry about it.  He's walking.  I think he's brave enough to come in, Anthony.  That's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at this.  The great Tony Danza.  Tony Danza, how you doing?  Don't walk.  Don't walk.  Tony Danza, how are you?  What a place to...  Tony's doing a song and dance act in town.  All right, listen. 
[02:39:00]  Let me move the condoms.  So, again, move everything out of the way from Tony Danza.  Tony's publicist in the lobby passing out.  Don't get up.  No, the girls will stay in there.  The girls will stay there.  Tony, you know what we're doing here today?  Have you been briefed a little bit?  No, I'm trying not to imagine.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to know anything about it so he can get out of here scot-free, but I told  him, for the record, I pointed inside, I said, good people.  And he said, you know, on the recommendation, he's going to come in and be a friend of the  show.  I said, oh, Jay Moore, he's cool.  And, oh, me and the boys.  If Jay Moore says you guys are cool, then you're cool. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  We're hanging.  We're going to be doing the Motley Crue Challenge is what it is.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  He doesn't want to know, no, he doesn't want to know anything about it.  Something there.  He's made a card he's going to know about it.  Have a salmon, Mr. Marshall.  They all start squawking.  Look at this little head out.  Yeah, you think you're funny.  Angela.  Don't even start beeping.  Angela.  Samantha.  What's the matter?  No, no.  You're kidding.  Really?  You boxing prick.  Take a swing, Kyle.  I'll own that hotel you're performing in.  Yeah, I know, though.  That daughter of yours there, Ava Save-A-Lot, turned out pretty nice, huh? 
[02:40:00]  Not bad, honey.  Nice.  Very nice.  So I just wanted to come in and say hello.  I see how it's deteriorating.  I think it's time for me to say goodbye.  You've got to come back when there's not shenanigans.  Yeah.  I'd love to come back.  You'll come back when there's not naked fat girls around?  Something tells me a few years back you'd have been in here really enjoying what was going on.  Yeah, I know.  Tony, what if those two girls were hot?  Would you have stayed?  I think those two girls are hot.  See?  I think they're beautiful.  Always the diplomat. 
[02:40:30]  The woman looks like Civil Shepard.  Yeah.  You guys are stable, didn't you?  Right?  Now you're looking at her in a whole different light.  Civil never had to hold up her belly.  What are you doing in town, Tony?  I'm going to go.  I'm playing Feinstein.  Michael Feinstein's placed at the Regency Hotel for three weeks.  I'm there until the 30th.  From the 12th to 30th.  I open tomorrow night.  Okay.  Anybody want to come in, come see some song and dance?  What could be better than getting really high and watching Tony Danza sing about a 15-song set?  What are they doing on the couch? 
[02:41:00]  They're going to replace the planetarium.  No, no, no, no, no.  Come in.  Let's go see Tony.  No, he can sing.  Hey, Tony.  Tony, you need an opening act?  We're on the couch right now.  Did you meet Jim Norton?  That opening act is going to be a lot more open in a couple of minutes.  We work together all the time.  All right, listen, guys, thank you.  All right, Tony.  Keep up the good work.  Some guests just leave.  Tony is fleeing the studio.  Tony is a good man.  Take it easy, Tony.  I think he just gave Jay more time.  There he goes. 
[02:41:30]  Well, they're all worked up from the scene on the couch.  All right, Tony.  That was a horrified Tony Danza.  I don't think he ought to be here.  That was a horrified Tony Danza.  Okay, listen.  We only have a few minutes left, and we've got to leave.  And the girls are ready for the Motley Crue Challenge.  Yeah, I've got to take position up where I can better describe the action, Opie.  So I'm going to go over to that mic.  Yeah, give me this mic.  Don't mind us.  This is professional radio at its best.  We never said it was going to be professional. 
[02:42:00]  All right, I got this mic.  You were going to be captivated.  That's right.  If you give me this one.  Hey, hey, hey.  Yeah.  Give me this one, and then you can probably see it anywhere you want.  The girls right now reclining on the lesbian couch.  Let me tell you, girls.  We have had upwards of seven girls on that couch at one time.  Opie, two of them can't even fit on this couch.  Barely fit, Anthony.  They are, like, pouring over the side.  Reminds me of a scene out of Battle of the Gargantuans.  Yeah, I remember that one. 
[02:42:30]  The red one and the blue one, was it?  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What?  Mendy, you've got to move that leg down so we can better see.  There.  Yeah.  Mendy, push some of that back in.  Wow.  Wow.  Looks like an explosion at the Play-Doh factory.  All right, hold on.  We should tell people that Steve from foundrymusic.com is getting some video clips.  I don't know what we're going to be able to show on foundrymusic.com, but we'll at least  be able to show the ladies, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So, after the show tonight.  That's a little jade piercing you got down there?  Later on tonight, you can go to fondrymusic.com to see what you missed, something we try to 
[02:43:00]  do on the show.  All right, this is the Motley Crue Challenge.  Yes, it is.  And you want to set up the scene here?  Well, we have the two girls reclined on the couch.  Each of their head is over one armrest.  You know, they've got one girl, her head on the armrest on one side of the couch, the  other girl, other side of the couch.  So, their most intimate area is facing each other.  They have the implement of destruction between them, covered with a condom. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  Wait.  And the object is, whoever gets to the money first wins the money.  The money will be in the middle of the implement.  Should we do best out of three?  Because this looks like it's going to be a very fast competition.  Yeah.  I was thinking more slow, but...  I thought this was going to be a struggle, but I don't think so.  You know what I didn't think, Opie?  I had no idea it was going to smell like the wrestling room in high school.  You know what?  You know what you got to do, though, girls?  You can't pull it away from the other girl. 
[02:44:00]  You have to accept it with yourself moving, because if one girl grabs it, then it just  becomes a ridiculous tug of war.  And for a visual for the listeners, just picture jabbing a pogo stick into hamburger meat.  Good.  I can't believe Tony Danza left.  Yeah, he was horrified, huh?  That was nice.  Out of respect, though, he came in.  I said, Tony, these are good guys.  No, he was...  Tony Danza ran in fear, like the place had just burst into flames. 
[02:44:30]  Did he kiss me on camera?  Because that'll fuel more gay rumors than me and Tony.  Yeah, there was some tongue in the bottom, too.  No, that was the Italian, you know, stay up, kid.  All right.  By the way, Mendy's belly looks like Steve's back after Steve, you know, did the moujon.  Use the moujon.  We'll pull back.  Do either one of you feel like you're being degraded?  Nice.  Okay.  No, this is interesting.  All right, listen, the $100 bill is in the middle of the apparatus.  And the president on it is lying.  I get a feeling Mendy's going to... 
[02:45:00]  I get a feeling that Mendy's going to swallow this thing.  She knows some special button.  Just wait yet.  We're not ready yet.  Okay, they're getting ready.  Tony, this is what Dr. Kennedy did to me to cure my ass cancer.  Carmen's having a good time.  Carmen, you ready?  I'm ready.  Mendy, you ready?  They're holding up their guts.  All right.  Hold up your guts.  All right, on three.  Well, Stinky, are you the official judge?  Get behind the couch.  Get behind the couch.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Your mom's in jail. 
[02:45:30]  They are ready.  I think he's tripping over cellulite.  In position.  Ladies.  On three.  On three.  One.  Two.  Three.  Whoa, there's a fight.  Rick, get out of the way.  God damn it.  Oh, they're fighting.  They're fighting.  Wait, wait.  Oh, oh.  They're fighting.  I think...  No, no.  We don't have a winner yet.  I think...  It's going back and forth like...  Oh, you got it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh.  I think Carmen got it.  I think Carmen got it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is disgusting.  Oh, my God.  You can't use your hands. 
[02:46:00]  Stinky can't tell.  You can't use my hands.  Stinky, move some of the plumber.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  What?  What's Stinky?  Wait, wait, what's Stinky?  The tape is holding on for dear life.  What's the matter there?  Oh, my God.  I'm fine.  Oh, my God.  Does it feel good, doesn't it?  What's it feel like?  Wait.  I'm hard.  It looks like it feels good or bad.  It feels good.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Do we have a winner? 
[02:46:30]  They're just having sex.  It's two fat chicks getting down, man.  Is that what you call what's going on?  Yeah, man.  Believe me.  It could be.  That could be a tie.  Carmen's about to go off like she won a game show.  I think that could be a tie.  Don't hurt her, Sybil Shepard.  Get your head in there.  Get in there.  Wow.  I think we might have a winner.  Stinky, get your head in there and take a look.  She took the tape and threw it away.  Send in a parakeet first to see if it dies. 
[02:47:00]  Put the canary in first.  All right, wait.  Hold on, ladies.  Who the hell is the $100 bill?  All right, hold on, ladies.  Back up.  There's a band on.  Back up.  Let's do this again.  Wow.  Let's do this again.  All right.  What happened to the $100?  The money's gone.  Hey, Carmen, are you okay?  They should be on their hands and knees.  Hey, Carmen, that feel good?  Did you like that?  All right.  Well, I think Carmen should get all the money.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's set up.  I tried to bludgeon her to death with that thing. 
[02:47:30]  Put that, give that to Carmen for a second.  Carmen.  What?  What was going on?  Like, you're twitching.  Is it a good thing or a bad feeling?  That's a very good thing.  Oh, it was good?  Yeah.  Did you actually...  No, no.  Close?  I'm just excited.  Yeah.  Who is it?  I'm just excited by the Miley Crew Challenge.  It's not every day.  Wow.  That was something.  All right, listen.  My God.  Do we do it again or what?  Yes.  Yeah, we have to.  We didn't get a winner.  We only have a couple minutes left.  We have to do this again.  We have two minutes left in the show. 
[02:48:00]  Ladies?  Huh?  Yeah.  No using hands.  No using hands.  They should be on their hands and knees then, backing into each other.  And so we can tell there's a winner.  You guys got to pour your bellies back.  So we can get a...  Roundtreemusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.  One word, baby.  Type it up.  Back into each other like two dumb tricks.  Dumpfruits.  Oh, my God.  They're going for the...  Oh, God.  I can park my bike in there, Norton.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Back to that.  People come from all over the world and play golf in Long Island.  Is that going to work?  Anthony, we only have a minute left in the show.  So, ladies, you got to hurry up. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, hurry up.  It's like two baby elephants fighting over a trunk.  Isn't that something?  They're going to attempt a different position.  All right.  It's being heavily lubed.  There you go, girls.  Now it's ready.  All right.  The money is in place.  All right.  All right.  Girls now back to back.  Back to back.  They are kneeling on the floor.  Yeah, look what Tony's missing.  Don't worry.  We'll look at the hump.  Move that chair. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, good.  Stinky, it's your job to get in there.  Whoa, what happened?  Oh, what?  All right.  She squealed.  Stinky, hold the money on with your...  All right.  Here we go.  Somebody feed him.  I think it was working better the other way.  Stinky, get your head on the floor so you can get in there.  Stinky, get in there.  Oh, poor Stinky, man.  It's like getting under an old Buick or two.  Got to get under there on the Creeper.  All right.  This is the second.  Oh, there we go.  All right.  How's that working, girls?  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:30]  It's like Teutonic plates moving.  We're not even playing.  Well.  All right, wait.  No, Mendy's getting the job done.  Why don't we just let him split the money and stab them?  That is something.  We're going to have to wrap this up.  Boy, look at that.  Quick, someone's going to have their initials on her.  I heard a gas bubble or something.  Oh, jeez.  What is wrong?  Game over.  All right, I'm running.  I'm coming away. 
[02:50:00]  They're starting.  They're starting.  I'm going home.  Here's your microphone.  Good night now.  Good night.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  It smells like a side of beef.  And there won't be any queefing at Rascals Wednesday or Friday.  Oh, my God.  You know, why don't we just write this off?  Holy ass.  And flee the area.  Well, where's Stinky?  Because he got the blood of that.  Your hazmat suit to me is not a cat. 
[02:50:30]  These girls all feel me who has.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Get that away from me.  No, don't.  The money's wet.  No, get rid of that $100 bill.  We don't need that.  Yeah.  Stinky.  What happened down there?  Jay's going to vomit.  Jay's running out.  Jay's dry heaving.  Stink.  What happened?  That's disgusting.  The money is now soaking wet, and we can't really determine a winner,  so I think they're going to have to split the prize.  Who farted? 
[02:51:00]  I don't know.  I don't know one of them.  Yeah, Rick.  I heard it.  You know what?  This is a horrible debut for the Motley Crue Challenge.  You know why?  Wow.  This was just God awful.  You know why this debut sucks?  Because Motley Crue used really hot shit.  Right.  Tony Danza ruined it.  This is like the Zebra Challenge.  I know.  It would have been easier if him and Danny DeVito did it.  I think they did.  All right.  We've got to wrap up.  You know it's Danny DeVito. 
[02:51:30]  Here.  Here.  Ladies, thank you.  Now they're just going to continue on the floor.  How often do fat chairs get to get pummeled like this?  Hey, just do it up, girls.  Have fun with yourselves.  Have fun.  And be here in the morning for the Spudgun.  500 pounds on that floor right now.  Two girls, 500 pounds.  Jess Omendi, you're hurting her.  You're supposed to be a publisher of a porno magazine.  You're bludgeoning her.  I feel sorry for the next guy that gets this $100 bill.  Yeah.  You know when your parents told you never put the money in your mouth because you don't 
[02:52:00]  know?  That's what they were thinking.  They knew.  They knew.  All right.  We want to thank Tony Danza for stopping by today.  Of course, Jay Moore and Jim Norton playing Rascals in West Orange on Wednesday.  I want to enter someone, oddly enough.  We're going to have to do the Motley Crue Challenge very soon to get this bad taste  out of our mouths.  With humans.  With humans.  That would be nice.  We're on the right path.  We've got to thank the girls, though, for being great sports.  Yeah.  Usually when two girls are in the studio having lesbian sex, we want to hang out after the 
[02:52:30]  show.  But look at everyone fleeing.  Everything the day after a flea market.  Nostate cancer doesn't kill erections like this, does it?  All right.  They're killing us, man.  We've got to go.  We're out.  Thank you.  Thank you for that, Mindy.  Oh, my God.  Just throw that bottle away.  Yeah, please.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say, make the bottles big enough where they usually 
[02:53:00]  don't fit in there.  But in that case, it went without a problem.  Sam Adams disappearing.  Yeah, okay.  Wow, thanks, ladies.  Anthony, Rockaway Bedding, 1-800-TRY-A-BED.
