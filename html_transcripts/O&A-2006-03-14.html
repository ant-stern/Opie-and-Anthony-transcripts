<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious, obscenity-laden feud with Bubba the Love Sponge. Opie and Anthony relentlessly insulted Bubba’s weight, radio persona ("Todd Clem"), and his perceived lack of integrity for joining SiriusXM after previously criticizing Howard Stern.  They played audio clips of Bubba, who accused them of copying his ideas (specifically a "torture rack" bit) and called them "hacks." Opie and Anthony vehemently defended their originality and longevity on XM, countering with various challenges – a Rocky Road ice cream eating contest or an octagon fight.  They also discussed rumors of their potential move to CBS radio to replace David Lee Roth, referencing related press coverage and internal "Divide and Conquer" strategies employed by management.  The banter included the studio crew and ended with further insults, challenges (including a chess match or bathroom fight), and no outside guests.

The vulgarity continued with another heated exchange, likely with Bubba again, centered on the previously offered physical confrontation.  The hosts used highly offensive and homophobic language, mocking the individual's weight and eating habits,  making derogatory comments about stomach stapling. The conversation included  insults directed at Howard Stern, focusing on his perceived phoniness, family relationships, and professional conflicts.

A significant portion focused on a confrontation between Opie and Anthony's listeners ("the PES") and Howard Stern near the Letterman studios. The hosts excitedly described the event, highlighting the large number of their supporters who surrounded Stern's limo, forcing his quick departure. They mentioned online video and audio of the incident.  They promoted their upcoming Hard Rock Cafe live show, inviting the individual involved in the earlier confrontation to attend. Multiple callers contributed to the chaotic atmosphere, adding to the speculation about professional rivalries and future actions.  The hosts also referenced a fake character named "Ned" from another show.

The show then shifted to Jimmy Norton’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame experience. Initial technical difficulties with the MiFi device were resolved before Norton recounted his unexpectedly long and enjoyable lunch with Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath.  He described detailed conversations about radio, censorship, and Black Sabbath trivia, pouring Iommi coffee. Ben and Steve, also present, were mentioned, their accounts teased for later. Norton detailed his efforts to gain entry to the ceremony, highlighting the assistance from his agent, Steve Wigg (Lars Ulrich's assistant), and Earl, a well-connected individual known for securing access.  His last-minute tuxedo acquisition added to the frantic preparations.  While Norton described the ceremony as "crushingly boring," he aggressively engaged with Metallica and Black Sabbath, securing photos despite initial setbacks. He emphasized his enthusiasm as a fan, not annoyance.  Bill Ward's earlier call to the show was mentioned, along with Norton's post-event exhaustion and the hosts' amusement.

The broadcast continued with discussions about celebrity feuds and controversies.  It began with Blondie's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, focusing on tensions between band members and resulting lawsuits. This led to discussions of similar conflicts within Guns N' Roses (Axl Rose and former members, including a vulgar quote from Scott Weiland's website aimed at Axl Rose) and the morbid humor surrounding the death of Peter Tamarkin and his wife in a plane crash.  The show compared public reactions to scandals in rock and hip-hop.  Norton’s Black Sabbath encounter was further emphasized, with listener calls contributing to discussions about Black Sabbath's significance to Norton and the show's topics.  Isaac Hayes' departure from *South Park* due to its portrayal of Scientology was discussed, including an audio clip of Hayes' previous appearance on the show.  The hosts mentioned distributing this clip to media outlets. The show included a "Celebrity Password" game, jokes about plane crashes, discussions of Ralphie May's weight loss and drainage bag from surgery, and a caller frustrated with a show employee.  The broadcast concluded with event promotions and a recap of the day's topics.

[00:00:00]  To be continued... 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock?  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole. 
[00:04:30]  Okay, terrific.  Asshole!  Okay, terrific.  Can you just mind your peas and juice, buster, and remember who you're dealing with?  Okay, terrific.  Call me, sir, goddammit.  Okay, terrific.  The family member dies, then you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Okay, terrific.  Have you ever seen a grown man naked? 
[00:05:00]  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  You like movies about gladiators?  Ah, good morning, and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM.  Satellite Radio!  Whoa, hey, whoa!  Ah!  That scared me.  Ooh.  That scared me.  Hi.  I'm scared.  Welcome, good morning. 
[00:05:30]  Greg, don't.  Couldn't talk.  I'm scared of all the people I piss off.  I'm scared.  Shaken?  I love getting under people's skin.  That's my song today.  I love getting under people's skin.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And then they make believe that I'm not getting under their skin.  Oh, that gets under my skin. 
[00:06:00]  I don't like that.  That song itself.  And then they threaten to beat me up.  Because I'm getting under their skin.  Thank you.  I like that, because you don't see the beating the up line coming.  No.  That's good.  This kid's got pizzazz.  Bunch of assholes out there, man.  Fucking assholes.  Assholes.  Yuck.  So how many people are threatening to beat me up today? 
[00:06:30]  Got Sada Marenga.  This radio business just stinks.  Let's see.  Today we're being accused of building a torture rack.  And Bubba the Love Sponge wants to fight me in an octagon.  Anywhere, really.  Are we actually part of this stupid business?  We are building a torture rack.  It's a rack they tie you to, and they pipe his show in. 
[00:07:00]  Fucking awful.  I'm going to talk like that, because I can't talk in my real voice.  You radio zilch.  Yeah, first of all, I don't acknowledge you, Bubba, until you talk in your regular voice.  Talk like a real person.  If you have a real problem with me, then why don't you start talking like a regular human being,  and then we'll see what you're all about.  Give us the Todd Clem voice.  Yeah, what's Todd all about?  Talk like Todd.  You know, the Todd that had to have his stomach stapled, 
[00:07:30]  because he wasn't feeling too good about himself,  because he couldn't keep food out of his fucking mouth.  Are you telling me that fatso had a stomach stapling?  Mm-hmm.  Absolutely.  That fucking embarrassment with not one ounce of stick-to-itiveness?  How about a few push-ups and a no to yourself in the mirror, you fucking fat hillbilly?  How about you say no to dessert and no to the fake radio voice, and then we'll talk?  You told him, Jimmy.  Stick-to-itiveness.  That's right.  Wow.  One ounce of it.  You know.  How about that?  This is supposed to be dynamic, where you build up to the big insults. 
[00:08:00]  And just more lies.  Just a lot of lies going on out there.  I would love for Steve or anybody familiar with our program to pull any audio of us  talking about building a torture chamber.  Or a torture rack or something like that.  Or a rack or whatever torture device.  Have we ever?  Did I miss something?  No.  I don't think Bubba the Love Sponge feels good about himself.  Todd.  I think he's getting...  Todd doesn't feel good about himself. 
[00:08:30]  Inaccurate info.  Because he had to kiss Howard's ass to get a job.  That had to hurt.  We don't have to kiss anyone's asses.  We do our own thing.  We continue to do our own thing.  He was making it sound like that was a bad thing.  That we didn't go in there and grovel to Howard.  And like we would have been over there if we did.  I don't think we want to be over there.  I guess we got audio coming or something.  Bubba...  You didn't work with Howard in the same company.  We did.  Believe me. 
[00:09:00]  I think we are a little more informed on what it's like to work in the same company as Howard.  And have to deal with him.  You'll learn in time.  You will.  It takes a little while.  You know, he does have a huge name.  Biggest name in radio.  And sometimes you get hypnotized by that for a little while.  But then the reality comes through.  He's an egomaniacal lunatic.  And very hard to work with.  You'll learn, though.  You'll see that.  Impossible to work with. 
[00:09:30]  Yep.  Because it's all about him.  You'll find that out, Bubba.  I feel sorry for you, actually.  That you had to kiss someone's ass.  It's going to be rough.  Because in all fairness, he was fighting the same fight we did.  Yeah.  And he couldn't handle it anymore.  So he had to cave in.  He had to cave in and join Howard.  And Howard, it wasn't long ago, we were in quite similar situations.  Being persecuted by commercial radio.  Thrown off the air.  And, you know, Howard was there. 
[00:10:00]  Kiss a little ass, you get on his channel.  But it's got to all be about Howard.  You know, you hear it in every break you do.  Every break that goes on over there at both of his channels.  It's all got to be about him.  I don't know.  Not into it.  Wouldn't be into it.  Sorry.  We're very happy here.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Ope. 
[00:10:30]  And my real name, before I had my name legally changed, was Todd, well, is or was, or my God-given name was Todd Clem.  And I don't like when people call me Todd Clem because that's not my name.  My name's Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.  I had it legally changed.  And I've never been Todd.  I've always been Bubba.  So I'm Bubba.  So don't all you fans out there try to be a dick and call me Todd Clem because I don't answer to it.  I don't like it.  If you call me Todd, it just means you're being a dick.  It's like you're just trying to screw with me.  You're just trying to piss me off.  I don't like it. 
[00:11:00]  If that doesn't say a lot.  Look, I'll be the first to admit I have the worst radio name.  But it's not a radio name.  It was a nickname that I was given when I was like 11 or 12.  I'm stuck with this fucking thing.  I hate it.  But I would never change my name legally to Opie.  To Opie the Love Sponge.  Todd is a good name.  Bubba the Love Sponge is a stupid name to have while you're walking around the real world.  I don't know.  I kind of like it.  It works kind of on radio, you know, because it's name recognition.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  But you have to, like, you know, go to restaurants and stuff.  Yeah.  When you sign, like, mortgage papers, you've got to put Bubba the Love Sponge on it.  Reservation for two.  Yeah, what's your name?  Bubba the Love Sponge.  It doesn't work in the real world.  A sponge.  Party of ten.  Sponge.  And it's just him and another guy.  Should be Bubba the Love Immigrant.  That works as well.  Well, here we go.  So here's some audio from Bubba the Love Sponge. 
[00:12:00]  Can we change our names?  Let's change our names.  You're Catty Jim.  That's right.  I'm Catty Jim.  Don't call me Jim Norton.  I don't like Catty Jim.  I changed my name.  I changed my name.  By the way, notice one thing as we play these clips.  No one's really having fun in radio anymore.  We are.  We still have a passion for this.  We have fun.  It's fun to come in here and do a show.  Overall, we're having a great time.  We still have passion to do this.  And we love, and I'll say it again, and that's why the pests love us, because they get it.  We love getting under people's skin. 
[00:12:30]  We love it.  Always have.  So for him to react like this, you played right into our hands again.  We love getting under your skin.  Absolutely.  It is fun.  Listen to the anger in this guy's voice.  Well, I'm glad that you guys take it that way, because that's how I intended it.  So thank you so much for the kindness, and more importantly, thanks for listening and buying the Equivit and paying your monthly subscription and all that bullshit.  Yeah, we love it all, Bob.  Keep it up, man.  Thank you.  It's guys like him, man.  And it's cool that we come in and do the show for, because the non-conventionality of this program and how you are not going to ever hear anything like what Howard is putting on his two channels. 
[00:13:00]  You're not going to...  I mean, you know what?  XM has their very shitty own shock jock channel.  First of all, it's not a shock jock channel.  No.  We don't really like the whole shock jock moniker.  It's sort of pigeonholing yourself.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like to talk about a little bit of everything.  A little bit of everything. 
[00:13:30]  We're a funny channel.  We're a comedy channel that do edgy things at times.  Yes, of course.  And it's just like, you know, it's such a bullshit ran copycat fucking wannabe hack shit.  How could it be copycat hack shit when we were here first, asshole?  And the channel hasn't changed since we got here, asshole.  But we were here.  We were here, what, over a year before Howard and you went to satellite radio, asshole. 
[00:14:00]  Todd, why don't you be honest, Todd?  As you'll hear later.  Todd!  As you'll hear...  Todd!  Hi, Todd!  Do I sound scared, Todd?  As we'll hear later, we do have a lot of geeks.  You play right into my strengths, Todd!  Oh, I can't do impressions, but I can do this very well, Todd! 
[00:14:30]  How's that stomach stapling, Todd?  We do have a lot of geeks, as you'll hear later.  Geeks on the show and fans of the show.  Perhaps they built some kind of a device that could show us the future, Opie.  And we saw what was happening over there and copied it and brought it back a year and did that.  Perhaps, because that's really the only way we could have copied anything that hadn't happened yet. 
[00:15:00]  We've been here.  We were sitting here building an audience for over a year before anything even started over there.  Right.  How are we copying?  How are we copying?  I don't get it.  Today's show will be just as awful as the first show we did for XM.  Thank you.  You will hear nothing different.  From day one, this channel has languished in mediocrity. 
[00:15:30]  We resent anybody saying anything differently.  It's more quantity than quality, we say.  Absolutely.  And we have more quantity.  We were here first, and we haven't changed since the first broadcast.  That's pretty obvious to most people out there.  Not one quality day since 2004.  That's the same despicable dreck.  That's right.  Day after day.  What day is it?  Who knows?  It doesn't matter.  It's four hours of verbal mush day.  Let's do five of these in a row and then take two days to sleep. 
[00:16:00]  This could easily be a replay.  Who knows?  We don't even know.  We could have done this show a year ago.  You don't even know out there, do you?  But for some reason, people tune in.  I don't know why.  See, we're still having fun, Todd.  Oh, don't say his name like that.  Poor Todd.  He said that the only people that call him that are people that are trying to be dicks.  Now, Opie.  Yeah.  Stop it.  I'm sorry.  Did you know Opie and Anthony Nalbrandt are now trying to have somebody build them a torture rack? 
[00:16:30]  Did you know that?  Yes.  And they're trying to say, well, we thought of it.  We thought.  Listen, you guys.  I'm all about.  Can we just have some truth in broadcasting as to how much of a fuck and how hack you two guys are?  You know what day that we brought up the torture rack idea?  I can give you the date.  September 19th, 2005, on the Howard Stern Show.  And these two guys are Howard ripoffs for years.  And these two guys would be. 
[00:17:00]  That's where they came.  That's when we came up with that.  I got news for you.  These two guys would be sitting on this channel.  Listen to this.  Probably on our slot.  And we'd be either doing middays or night.  No, it's great.  He admits that we're better than him right there.  He kind of, that is a backhanded compliment.  Thank you, brother.  What he's going to say here is that if we kissed Howard's ass like he had to, we would be on that channel, on the Howard Stern channel.  No fucking way, pal.  And we would be doing afternoons. 
[00:17:30]  And he would have to do middays.  We all know that middays is that ugh slot.  And nights isn't much better.  Yeah.  So he's admitting that we would have the better time slot over there.  But we're hacks.  But we're hacks.  I don't like this show being called Hacked.  And I want to challenge him to a listener call up and have a Rocky Road ice cream eating contest just to settle it.  Hey.  Just to settle it, bub.  Settle down, tough guy.  Settle down.  I say we have like a battle of the sexes.  We'll show him who's not hacked.  I like that idea. 
[00:18:00]  It's safe and no one gets hurt.  That's right.  Bub the LS.  Probably on our slot.  And we'd be either doing middays or nights.  If they didn't suck so bad?  Well, if one, they didn't suck so bad.  If two, they just had endured themselves.  Or he'd be.  Endured themselves.  Or you'd be here talking about how much Sirius sucks, how much ONA or Howard ass kissers.  Do you see how it works? 
[00:18:30]  I mean, I hate to really pull that curtain away, but do you see how it really works?  If we were over there on Howard's channel, if we had gone and kissed the ring of Satan and taken that slot, there's a good chance Bubba would be here at XM doing a show bashing us for kissing Howard's ass.  And that's just the way it is.  It's radio.  Do you remember when he came to New York about how many years ago it was and he issued the challenge to Howard Stern? 
[00:19:00]  He's being broadcast, of course, in Connecticut because, you know, he wasn't.  That was the closest you could get to New York radio, by the way.  Exactly.  Hartford, Connecticut.  Hey, when the wind blew the right way, you could hear it on the north shore of Long Island.  We're here in northern Connecticut.  We're going to make Scrimshaw.  Fucking idiot.  And he issued that cornball.  You fucking cornball.  He issued that challenge.  I challenged Howard Stern and no one cared.  Well, the company he was working for at the time didn't have enough confidence in him. 
[00:19:30]  And they were thinking about bringing him to New York.  This is a fact, by the way, that he can't deny.  So what they did was they had a station in Hartford, Connecticut.  See, I know the radio business, okay?  They threw him in Hartford, threw him in mornings, a market that Howard was in.  We'll see how he does against Howard in Hartford.  If he does any type of ratings, we'll bring him to New York.  That never happened.  He failed miserably.  He failed miserably.  I mean, he bombed.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  The only city he's ever done really well in is his hometown of Tampa. 
[00:20:00]  That's it.  That's it.  And maybe another Florida city.  That's it.  And we did very well in a lot of markets around the country.  And the most important, we killed in New York City, the number one radio market.  We were a success.  Beyond a success story.  Beyond a success story.  He was never even on a New York radio.  They just had endured themselves, endeared themselves.  We did endure ourselves to Howard, believe me. 
[00:20:30]  And pay some homage to him, and realize how to fucking work smart, and that you're not  the end-all, be-all, and coexisted with Howard.  Back in the day, they wouldn't have been in the druthers that they are today.  Druthers?  Ugh.  What are druthers?  You listeners don't want to hear that word, faggot.  They used to be called knickers.  Now they're druthers, and I enjoy them.  What are druthers?  Druthers.  I have never heard the word.  Those guys are in Dutch. 
[00:21:00]  Are we?  I don't know what druthers is.  We're in druthers?  He's a little jealous.  That is embarrassing.  Howard Stern has his channels, and look, you can look right on the damn pad, Dana.  We have our own channel here on XM.  That's pretty impressive.  And he knows that's impressive.  It wasn't long ago that we were in very similar situations.  Druthers, the right or chance to choose.  Given my druthers, I'd eat cake, said Bubba the love sponge. 
[00:21:30]  I don't want to be in druthers.  Must have been given a lot of druthers.  Don't move above 110th Street filled with druthers.  My daughter ain't bringing no druthers home.  Druthers lover.  Hey, druthers, where's Sheriff Brantford?  I wouldn't be in the druthers they're in.  Not long ago, we were all in the same situation. 
[00:22:00]  Not liking Howard because he's an arrogant prick.  And fighting the fight, you know, against him being an asshole trying to ruin other radio personalities' careers.  I mean, that's what he does.  He sees a threat.  He tries to destroy that show's credibility.  Bubba knows.  He was in the same boat.  We come from different, you know, schools of thought as far as radio goes. 
[00:22:30]  It's that southern thing, you know, the NASCAR thing.  We're Yankees from the north, you know.  So, regardless, there was, back then, some common ground in that we were fighting against the FCC, against corporate ownership of the stations caving in to bullshit, and Howard Stern being an asshole.  So, who changed?  Who changed here?  Did you really get a revelation and change, Bubba? 
[00:23:00]  Or was it you were offered a gig, and in order to take it, you had to kiss Howard's ass?  We weren't willing to do that.  And there are plenty of reasons and plenty of history as to why we made that choice.  It wasn't just, Howard's a big radio name, let's screw him over or badmouth him.  It wasn't it.  There's a history there.  We worked at the same company and took his shit for years. 
[00:23:30]  It's not about kissing his ass.  If you want to do it, God bless you.  Make a good living.  Have fun.  But as far as bashing us for not doing that, I think you got it a little backwards, man.  You kind of look stupid, Todd.  Yeah, it looks very hypocritical.  And even your faithful listeners, they don't forget what you used to say about Howard.  Yeah, it's very hard to have credibility.  Our own listeners call us out all the time when we do stupid things.  You don't think your faithful listeners are going, what the fuck, does the same guy that used to fight Howard? 
[00:24:00]  You ruin your credibility.  And challenge him to fake fights and challenge him to put on the gloves and go into an octagon.  I like that idea.  I like that idea.  We should all put on red shorts and have a ton of war.  I'd rather just put on the big fake sumo wrestling suits.  That at least looks fun and safe.  Can you do that last, say, 15 seconds is fucking embarrassing.  That is like, that's like Stockholm Syndrome. 
[00:24:30]  That's like when a woman has been raped and beaten, suddenly yelling at other rape victims for testifying against the same attacker.  Saying, Jimmy's a good guy.  Exactly.  That guy with the Breathe Right strip.  He did it.  Last 15 years?  Dude, yeah, but if they just would have, what an embarrassing, dude, that's an inner thought you should keep to yourself.  How many girls have Breathe Right fibers up their ass?  I guess they may find some off the belt.  We found some.  Yeah.  If two, they just had endured themselves, endeared themselves. 
[00:25:00]  It's funny that he said endure.  To Howard.  We did endure.  And pay some homage to him and realize how to fucking work smart.  and that you're not the end-all, be-all, and coexisted with Howard.  Back in the day, they wouldn't have been in the druthers that they are today.  Do you understand the embarrassing admission that is?  The fucking, if you guys would have just learned to coexist and paid homage. 
[00:25:30]  Paid homage.  What a fucking worm, dude.  Dude, the guy was fucking us at every turn.  Listen, if you sat there and tried to get guests and were told by the guest,  I'd love to do your show, but Howard is telling me I can't,  would you then pay homage to him?  Hmm?  If when you mentioned his name in anger or in any context,  Mel Karmazin came to you and had a meeting and threatened you with firing 
[00:26:00]  and threatened the firing of your general manager,  if you didn't shut up talking about Howard,  yet he kept bashing you,  you're then supposed to pay homage to him?  Don't you understand?  I think we're closer to the Howard situation and working with him.  It must be nice.  You're in the honeymoon phase and everything, and that's fine.  It must be great.  I'll tell you, when I first got into radio,  it would have been great to have a relationship with Howard.  That was the biggest thing in radio. 
[00:26:30]  Of course it's like a new guy in radio's dream to have some kind of rapport with that guy,  especially at that point in his career.  It didn't work out, and believe me, it wasn't because of what we were doing.  We were just trying to eke out a living.  It was our first time in New York radio like that, New York City.  We were just trying to hammer out a career, which we did very well.  He didn't like that in his backyard and did a lot of things behind the scenes. 
[00:27:00]  We were there.  We lived it.  You didn't.  The honeymoon is going on right now.  It's very cute.  I'm sure Allison loved the honeymoon, too.  You know?  After a few years, it's, I'm in love with a furniture man.  Give me your money.  Give me your money.  Give me your money.  Give me your money.  I mean, that's the brutal truth, but, you know, you'll see.  You will see in time. 
[00:27:30]  Let's go to Ian in Nova Scotia.  Ian.  Yeah, I just wanted to point out to that dumbass that it's not homage.  It's homage, you hathole.  No, he legally had it changed to homage.  Ah, that's right.  Nothing.  Okay.  I'll get a little more for that.  It was fun.  Then he had a mouthful of eggs.  He was chuckling.  I have a mouthful of eggs.  I'm just wondering why you throw yourself under the bus when you're trying to train.  Bash you guys.  Yeah.  But he's, like, bashing you for standing up for yourself.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  It's very hypocritical.  Not so much hypocritical. 
[00:28:00]  Just the A-D-D.  Yeah, how do you...  It lacks credibility and, like, real passion in what you're saying.  Yeah.  He's bashing us for being an original.  Yeah.  We don't have to kiss anyone's ass.  We're not going to kiss the ass of the guy that fucked us over for years.  You guys are gay.  I bet you like holding down a girl eating her pussy, don't you?  You guys are gay.  You like pussy.  Wait a minute.  Hey, wait.  How do we answer that?  Bubba, it's the other way you're...  Oh.  All right, here we go.  I'll fight him.  It gets way better, by the way.  He's a goose, this Bubba.  This gets way better. 
[00:28:30]  Just listen to the frustration and the anger.  Just listen to how we got under his skin.  How's my song go again?  I forgot the words already.  It's something along the lines.  I like the remake, but the original is something about,  I get under people's skin.  Yeah, it was really the most annoying assortment of notes and words.  It was toneless, and yes, it wasn't.  It had a beat to it, and yet it was devoidable.  A beat, yet a complete lack of tonality.  There was something about it, though, wasn't it?  Something catchy.  Yes.  All right, thank you, thank you. 
[00:29:00]  It's kind of like having your foreskin scrape to the razor.  Catchy like the Hunter virus.  Here we go.  I promise you that they will not get re-signed by XM.  All right.  There is...  Oh, my God.  More of this shit.  Can we hold on to that?  More of this shit.  Can we hold on to that one single clip?  Yeah, of course.  Just put it in your pocket somewhere.  Of course.  Because that will be played year after year that we're here.  By the way, we've had some major meetings behind the scenes lately. 
[00:29:30]  Regardless of what you're reading, hearing, any rumors that are going around,  here are some facts I will give you.  We have had meetings.  There have been plenty of phone calls regarding certain situations.  Situations.  With other companies, other radio companies, and our own company, XM.  There have been talks of us staying around here at XM. 
[00:30:00]  It's called an extension.  For quite some time.  We could say it.  I mean, they want an extension to our deal.  They want us here.  Not only do they not want to fire us, let's take that extreme.  Not only will we not be re-signed or anything, we're going to be re-signed for longer,  for a longer term, because they understand what we bring to the table here and want to have that.  And now that there's other action coming in, they want to assure that they're part of what we're doing 
[00:30:30]  and that we're part of what XM is all about.  Again, Bubba, I don't think you have an insight into what's going on here at XM.  I really don't think you have as much of an insight into what's going on here at XM as we do at Sirius.  We have people over there that love yapping.  They are a bunch of chatty Cathy's over there and former friends.  We have people that used to work here, there, working for us.  There are still relationships that are going on. 
[00:31:00]  They might smile, look you in the face and smile and say good morning,  but those same people turn around and tell us everything that goes on over there.  Everything.  From the cute little pixie program director right up to Mel K.  Why is there dusting sprinkled in the hallway?  Oh, yes, he's here today.  He should have little wings.  Little elfin shoes.  Oh, little wood elf.  He should have pointy ears.  March of the Kneeling Soldiers. 
[00:31:30]  Just adorable.  All right, so do you want to hear this stuff?  I don't know.  This guy is kind of scary, man.  Yeah.  He's a tough dude.  I promise you that they will not get re-signed by XM.  All right.  And I promise you they will not come here.  And I promise you that regular radio is not going to touch them.  No, there's an article on All Access today that says, you know how they were trying to spread the rumor.  Right, right.  The David Lee Roth shit. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Right.  Well, a CBS spokesperson came out and flatly said, absolutely not.  Never will they work for CBS radio again.  That wasn't the quote, by the way.  No, they are denying stuff right now.  We absolutely have been in talks with fucking CBS radio, you assholes.  We keep it honest here.  We absolutely have been talking to CBS radio about replacing David Lee Roth.  Go fuck yourselves.  But we're going to do it on our terms. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Again, a little dignity, a little taking a position where you're not going to compromise your show.  Things like that are very important to us.  That's why we didn't kiss Howard's ass.  You call it paying homage.  We call it kissing ass.  And it ain't going to happen.  We're not going to compromise the, and you might laugh when a lot of people do, when you say the integrity of this show. 
[00:33:00]  Because, you know, it is a goofy show to have integrity.  But we have integrity as far as respect of our listeners and what we put out to them on a daily basis that they enjoy.  And we're not going to compromise that for a few bucks for a gig to warm up to some radio legend that's just a tad past his prime.  It's not going to happen.  You can sit over there.  You know, I'm sure you sleep well.  Probably a little apnea thrown in. 
[00:33:30]  But I'm sure you sleep well at night.  You're making a nice paycheck, I would gather.  I hope.  I hope out of $500 million, he's throwing you some money.  You know, you're a loyal soldier.  You're in there pushing his name every five minutes.  But that isn't what we're all about.  I don't think that makes us the hypocrites, the bad guys, the people that lack credibility.  And if he doesn't believe it, we'll put him in a torture device, won't we?  The second we have it built, we have our people working on it. 
[00:34:00]  I don't even know what that's about.  But, Bubba, really, review where you got that info from and really question that because I cannot remember.  First of all, I don't think I've been in a drunken stupor on the show, on the XM show anyway, where I would have forgotten that.  There's never been a call out to build any torture device.  What kind of torture device is it?  Is that where you kind of, like, change your name to some wacky 80s moniker and then you have your fat stomach stapled? 
[00:34:30]  How about just telling yourself no?  How about that?  There it is.  No, I can't have that.  Self-control.  How about just N-O, fat boy?  Anyway, the Boston Herald reports today that rumors are rampant that CBS is in talks with ex-WAF Jock's Opie and Anthony to replace syndicated morning man David Lee Roth.  Ope and A, that's how it's written in this one, who were fired by CBS back in 2002 for inciting a couple to have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral, now yak on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:35:00]  The story is that a censored version of that show would be syndicated.  Word is Roth, who replaced the irreplaceable Howard Stern, wants out.  Boston Herald reporting that today.  And I think we're in the Daily News today, too, right?  Yeah.  The Daily News, CBS drama, XM Radio's Opie and Anthony said little yesterday about reports that they have signed for a syndicated CBS radio show, even as a CBS spokeswoman reiterated they have not. 
[00:35:30]  The reports had ONA potentially replacing David Lee Roth on WFNY after a week in which Roth accused his bosses of trying to dilute his show and warned that he might be fired.  Yesterday, neither he nor ONA said much on the subject.  Opie at one point said the rumors are true, but didn't specify what rumors.  Anthony joked about an autopsy saying someone had died of boredom from listening to Roth.  My bad?  No, he didn't, and they got that completely wrong. 
[00:36:00]  I don't remember saying that.  It was the couple that they found naked in the garage.  They were having sex in the garage, and they got the carbon monoxide poisoning.  Right.  And I said something like, you know, they didn't die from carbon monoxide poisoning.  They were listening to David Lee Roth.  It was a hack joke, and they got that completely wrong in the paper.  No surprise there, though.  It was a pretty good, it came out good, though, the way it was written.  It came out okay, died of boredom, a good slam.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  You two guys.  They can even drink Moondust.  You two guys had some decent name recognition. 
[00:36:30]  You two guys.  Yeah, we had.  Yeah.  We're in a Boston paper today in the New York paper.  Yeah, you're right, Bubba.  What can I tell you?  You're so right once again.  You two guys.  We had a...  We had, right?  Yeah, we had.  We had it, huh?  Hey, guys.  There's two articles today alone.  You two guys could have, would have, should have worked a hell of a lot smarter.  Smart, smart.  You two guys are over. 
[00:37:00]  He got fired, too.  You know?  Isn't that working smart?  We were working smart.  We were doing everything.  And this is right out of probably some of the same quotes Bubba made to the press.  We were working smart within the guidelines that were given to us.  They were always pushing the personalities to do more, more, more.  Get the name recognition out there.  Get your name in the paper.  Get the ratings.  And I remember reading articles.  Which we did perfectly, by the way.  I've read articles and interviews with Bubba as he was saying the same thing I'm saying now. 
[00:37:30]  Then the rules changed, and we were the last to really know.  Instead of the stations backing you up, they threw your ass out the door.  And that's what happened to us.  And as a matter of fact, I'll be honest.  When he got fired, it was after we had been fired.  He got fired.  But we had traded some correspondence, me and the love sponge.  You did?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  About being fired and how much it sucks and how much broadcast radio blows and stuff.  And good luck.  Hope something can work out.  Whatever.  And then you get this.  You get this.  That's why you can't correspond with radio guys.  They're a bunch of phonies.  No.  One moment they're on your side, and then the next moment they get a gig.  And they're like, ah, they forget they ever even corresponded to you.  Because you almost felt like there's this.  You're hoped anyway.  But radio just sucks ass, man. 
[00:38:30]  You hoped there would be some kind of camaraderie in the way you were treated by corporate radio.  It's something that only a few of us have been through, and it's like a fraternity of guys that have been through that shit.  Another guy, a fan of the show, I still get emails from him and correspond with him, is Marconi.  He's not the original.  I was, I did work with him for a while. 
[00:39:00]  But Marconi, he got fired.  And me and him traded some emails about it because you kind of, you can commiserate with the bullshit that's going on.  And then when it just turns around and gets like this, this is the phony part of it.  It's like, come on.  But, you know, we're doing what we do here, and we really didn't want to kiss anyone's ass to do it.  We did it on our terms.  Any deals that happen or don't happen in the future will be because we do things on our terms. 
[00:39:30]  And one of those things is we're not kissing Howard's ass.  Another thing is we're not going to destroy the credibility of this program.  As I see it, you've done both by kissing Howard's ass like that after years of bashing him.  Not without merit.  What am I going to sit there and go, hey, the guy was just, you know, bashing Howard for no reason? 
[00:40:00]  No, I'm sure, you know, he had his reason.  He was shit on by Howard Stern.  Anyone that got a name in radio was shit on by Howard Stern.  That's Howard's insecurities.  Anyways, and it happened to him.  But instead of, you know, instead of acknowledging that, he turned around and, you know, got a gig and now has to kiss his ass.  And I know, I fucking know it leaves a bad taste in his mouth.  I know that is not something he enjoys doing. 
[00:40:30]  Can't be.  Could you imagine?  No.  You get a gig.  You're offered some cash.  You take it.  You take it.  There's nothing else out there.  So you take the gig.  Part of it is kissing Howard's ass.  Would you honestly feel that love toward the guy and sincerity in the praise?  Or would you just be going, fuck, man, I got to pay my car payment.  This is paying my car payment.  Just fucking whatever you got to do, bro.  Whatever you got to do.  I would always get the deuce chills over the years when some of Howard's old competitors would have to go on a show to kiss his ass to get another job. 
[00:41:00]  John DiBella is the biggest one.  What are you doing to yourself?  When John DiBella had to go on Howard's show, and this is back in Howard's heyday.  But he's done this with a few other guys, too.  And it's like, what are you doing?  Are you that desperate?  And they had to ask Howard for permission to broadcast.  The same shit happened with Bubba.  You got to play right into Howard's ego. 
[00:41:30]  And you feel good about yourself, Bubba?  Wasn't going to happen.  Todd, you feel good about yourself?  We could have been working again a lot sooner than two fucking years that we spent off the air.  However, the conditions that were put on us was that we had to sign a piece of paper.  All we had to do was sign a piece of paper that said, you will not talk about Howard Stern when you get your next gig.  You're free to work.  Here you go.  We'll release you from any obligation.  You go anywhere you want. 
[00:42:00]  You can work.  Make all the money you want to make.  Here's a piece of paper.  And we'll finally release you guys.  We'll release you.  Just sign this.  You will not talk about Howard Stern.  For how long, by the way?  Forever.  Right.  Forever.  For the rest of our lives.  For the rest of our lives, we couldn't talk about it.  There's the arrogance, Bubba.  There's the fucking after the honeymoon's over.  There's the shit that they tried to feed us.  And we wanted to work.  We knew we could have made more money working, first of all, than we were making sitting out.  And we wanted to work. 
[00:42:30]  We enjoy doing the show.  We have fun doing it.  But it was a no-brainer.  We didn't even discuss it for two seconds.  Me and Opie sat down and went,  There is no way we can get on the air and honestly address what has happened to us over the course of the years we spent at Infinity Broadcasting and not speak about what Howard did to us and our careers.  And we turned to them and said, No.  No, we'll sit out.  Take your paper.  We'll sit out.  Which was taking a big chance because we're like, Wow. 
[00:43:00]  We didn't know what was going to happen.  We got to sit out over two years.  People might just forget about us.  Regardless of who the fuck you are, two years is a long time to sit without your name being out there and without pulling shenanigans on the radio and without doing a show.  We understood that.  But there was no way we were going to compromise ourselves and sign that piece of paper.  Wasn't going to happen.  So do you honestly think that since we did that, that we could have turned around if we had the opportunity to go to Sirius?  But a condition is to praise him every five minutes is what it seems like everyone's got to do. 
[00:43:30]  And how does Todd explain to his faithful listeners all the audio of Howard trashing him?  Yeah.  How do you explain that to your listeners?  How do you explain that, Todd?  How do you have credibility after that?  All right.  I mean, I'm just – I'm not even – I'm not even getting into the, you know, you're an asshole or anything.  I'm just spelling out what the listener sees and having – it's something about integrity, you know, which just – it's not there.  I'm not seeing it over there. 
[00:44:00]  And this is why we're better than you, Todd.  We have an honesty to our program and an intelligence that you don't have.  And if someday we're thrown off the air because of that, I can completely deal with it.  I'll live with it.  If we're thrown off because we won't do something that we feel affects us personally or the show, the integrity of the show, and for that reason we don't work, I'd be fine with that.  What are we going to do? 
[00:44:30]  Go there and kiss Howard's ass after he fucked us for that many years?  It ain't going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  Can we maybe later talk in funny voices?  Sure.  I don't like talking in our real voices.  It's not professional.  Nine o'clock.  I got to take a leak badly.  I'll come right in with you.  All right.  That'll be fun.  I want us to sing that song together.  You want to make a little brawl in the bathroom?  I was thinking a chess match.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was pretty good at chess growing up.  Jimmy's pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  We'll play some chess like true nerds.  We'll challenge them to a chess match.  Challenge it a checker.  What is it called?  Marcus of Queensbury rules or marquee of – what is it called?  That's what I want to fight.  It's called faggot boxing.  I want me and you in the bathroom squaring off like the fighting Irish guy.  That's how I want to fight.  Put up your dukes.  It's going to be quite a Donnybrook.  How do you even know a Donnybrook?  Donnybrook.  I don't even want to know.  I'm not even going to play that old game. 
[00:45:30]  Donnybrook.  Well, St. Paddy's Day is coming up.  You're just too smart for everybody.  Thank you.  I'm a geek.  I'm a geek.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  We'll be right back. 
[00:46:00]  You're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before we want you, sir.  You're going to get what you deserve.  Perfect lyrics today.  Perfect.  We bow to no one.  We bow to no one.  Except for that shut show, eh? 
[00:46:30]  Huh?  No one makes a pops of picker.  Except for that shut show, eh?  Eh?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  And once again, we have gotten under someone's skin.  Just playing right into our hands.  What can I tell you?  Well, we haven't even gotten into the fight segment yet.  I hate to tear down the fifth wall, but this is exactly what we're looking for. 
[00:47:00]  It's a hell of a room.  A lot of walls.  Walls?  This is exactly what we try to do.  We get under Howard's skin.  Now we're getting under Todd's skin.  Our pests do the same exact thing.  Isn't it fun, pests?  All the pests.  Isn't it fun?  Isn't it fun to chase someone's limo with signs?  Watch it scream away like it's being shot at?  That looked like Reagan going to the hospital.  I don't know.  We got so much.  So much.  We might have to do ten hours of radio today. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, that's right.  We can't because there's a master computer that turns us off at 11.  Master computer.  Really, really smart.  We really got to solve that problem.  That's the next problem we got to solve.  If we have our own channel, let us talk as long as we want and then figure it out after  that.  We're just jealous.  All right.  Let's get back to the audio here.  Worked a hell of a lot smarter.  But they're not smart.  And you two guys are over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I have a standing request for that little fuck, Anthony. 
[00:48:00]  No, no, not Anthony.  I actually don't mind him.  It's that other little fuck.  My pal, Bubba the love sponge.  You and I.  I want to meet you.  You and Todd.  Thank you very much.  The Anthony and Todd Show on Free FM.  Now, it's between you and him.  I can now sit on the sidelines and listen to my good friend, Bubba.  Could you get me a picture with him?  I'd like to meet Bubba.  I'll see if I can arrange that, Jimmy.  He changed his name.  He's crazy.  Let's see. 
[00:48:30]  Is this Divide and Conquer?  It could be the...  Actually, wow.  We might have to send him a prize.  Let me check.  It is the 1,000th attempt in our career of the Divide and Conquer.  1,000 times this has been tried by management.  Everybody has given it a try.  Oh, the press.  The Jews.  Them, too.  Other radio companies. 
[00:49:00]  Even little Jimmy Norton has tried this tactic.  Oh, everybody.  No, it wasn't.  It was Divide and Get Hummers, Get Razors.  So I was trying to joke it.  Oh, I'm just eating your Kashi.  You're much better at eating Kashi.  I like Kashi.  I realized I'm bad at that joke because I tried to readjust in mid-punch line and it backfired.  Bubba has just shown perhaps he has a bit more fancy taste than we're giving him.  The Divide and Conquer.  We get it, Todd. 
[00:49:30]  We get it.  It's not going to work, though.  Don't fall for that old gag.  This is an old gag, too.  Anthony.  No, no, not Anthony.  I actually don't mind him.  It's that other little fuck.  Opie.  I was going to say Jimmy.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  You guys.  You Opie.  Doesn't this guy understand he's playing right?  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  He's playing right into my...  That sums it up.  He's playing right into my strengths. 
[00:50:00]  I know what my weaknesses are when it comes to radio.  I'll be the first to tell you.  But I also know what my strengths are.  And you're playing right into my strengths.  Can we play the beginning of that one more time?  It's just chilling.  What part?  Just do it right five seconds before.  All right.  Fuck, Anthony.  No, no, not Anthony.  I actually don't mind him.  It's that other little fuck.  Opie.  I've had that conversation.  And who hasn't? 
[00:50:30]  Look at that room.  Right.  I mean, just look around.  They've all said the same thing.  Just look around.  Steve is saying it right now.  I don't mind Anthony.  That little fuck Opie.  Why does he make fun of the stomach stapling?  He never had to do it to save his own life.  Right.  No.  You don't think I was thinking that when I said that?  Did you want a world without Steve?  Lava from Yellowstone.  Ramone, bring me some dignity. 
[00:51:00]  You phony voice faggot.  Ramone, I don't mind Anthony.  Ramone, knock me down to middays.  I guess this was supposed to get to me.  I don't know.  Was it?  I don't know, but it does reinforce what you were saying, Opie.  Like you're a real human being. 
[00:51:30]  Would something like this get to you?  I need some advice here.  I don't know.  I've never had it.  See, this is what you said the other day.  But I'm just liked by everybody.  I understand that.  I don't know what it is, but I really am liked by many people.  But really, am I supposed to get to this?  This is supposed to get to me or whatever?  Perhaps.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But it plays right into my strengths.  How's it?  Let me look at you.  No, not a bit. 
[00:52:00]  No.  No.  You look exactly the same as you did yesterday and the day before.  There's not even an expression change.  Just an emotionless psychopath.  Do people understand that I get off on this stuff, knowing that I get under someone's  skin?  I hate to tear down the sixth wall, but...  How many walls do you have?  Can we get a contractor in here?  This place is like a madhouse.  It's a heptagon.  I'm working up to the octagon.  That's right.  Heptagon.  Wait, is hex hept...  All right.  Hex is six.  But I love this shit. 
[00:52:30]  I can't tell you.  I love that I can get to people.  I love it, love it, love it.  Obviously.  I've enjoyed this my entire life.  It's a sport for me.  It's good sport.  It is.  When you play the audio of other radio guys and you can hear the anger in their voice  and the frustration and how they just want to punch in the face.  Well, that does come up, doesn't it?  I enjoy this.  I can't believe we're not even up to the fight.  And that's why we got the pest mentality. 
[00:53:00]  Because I'm like, why should I be the only one enjoying this?  Let others enjoy.  I think others out there would enjoy this just as much.  Share it, Opie.  Anthony.  No, no, not Anthony.  I actually don't mind him.  It's that other little fuck.  Opie.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  I think I could get it done.  You guys, you Opie, you little red-headed dick-on-a-dog-looking pussy fuck.  The difference between you and I is I'm a real guy. 
[00:53:30]  I'm a man's man.  Okay.  And if I can pick some out.  Are you?  One interpretation of that man's man thing.  A man's man would have his stomach stapled.  So was Robert Reed.  Look where it got him.  Wouldn't a man's...  Then it's a pin, Magoo.  Wouldn't a man's man not give a shit what he...  He wouldn't give a shit.  Wouldn't a man's man not give a shit what he looks like?  Mm-hmm.  And he wouldn't get his stomach stapled and he would just continue feeding his fat fucking face with cake 
[00:54:00]  to hide something that's going on in his psyche?  Mm.  Perhaps a childhood rape.  Perhaps not.  Dare to dream, Jimmy.  Man's man.  Have a pabst.  A man's man.  A man's man isn't getting his stomach stapled.  Sorry, Steve.  Yeah.  Oh.  Sorry, Steve.  That's right.  No offense, fucking computer nerd.  Man's man isn't getting tattooed all up his arm.  Sorry, Steve.  Sorry, Steve. 
[00:54:30]  Exactly.  Man's man isn't leaving some sort of homoerotic Mike Piazza beard.  Sorry, Steve.  Sorry, Steve.  Man's man isn't about to run in here and punch me in the side of my face.  Hey, no one can see this because someone locked the door because here he comes.  Oh, no.  I don't want to deal with this.  Oh, no.  He's coming.  He could be coming after you or me.  I don't know.  Here he comes.  Gee, who do you think he's coming after?  You or me?  Paycheck?  Oh, geez.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There's a hug.  It's a bear hug.  I love you. 
[00:55:00]  Steve really is loved.  Yes.  He gets a lot of ribbing on this show.  We love Steve.  But Steve is loved.  And I got to tell you, Steve, I'm going to say it.  You look great.  Thank you so much, Anthony.  You are really, really trimmed down.  Look at him.  He's wearing a black shirt.  Yep.  And, of course, sleeveless.  Of course.  You look fantastic.  Thank you.  You are really slimming down.  He's getting a V.  Thank you.  A V.  What are your pants size now?  Now it's 38.  I'm trying to get into the 36s.  But you're a big guy. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I'm still way too 50.  But you're not fat.  Not as much.  No.  No, you're not fat, Steve.  Not as much.  Well, I'm still trying to see this shit right here.  You know what it is?  Let me tell you.  But you're bigger up top than you are in the midsection and around the bottom.  Yeah.  Husky.  It's probably the last 30-pound push, and then I'll get rid of all of the fatness from being  a fat guy.  It's just diet and working out right now.  Well, you lose, because it's winter.  During the hibernation, I guess, you lose a lot of the weight. 
[00:56:00]  Exactly.  That's good.  Exactly.  There you go.  We love you, Steve.  Thank you.  What about you, Jimmy?  Beyond words.  He says that now.  I'm going to take two steps up this thing.  Oh, no.  Call me a faggot asshole again.  I adore Steve.  Listen, we've got to get back into this.  I just don't want to get threats, man.  This is frightening.  Audio.  A little scary.  I don't like it.  I want to thank Todd for this audio today, because we had nothing planned for this program.  Let's be honest with each other.  Please.  The difference between you and I is, I'm a real guy.  I'm a man's man.  Man's man. 
[00:56:30]  Ooh.  And I can kick some ass.  Ooh.  I'm not the toughest guy in the world.  That's the 40s terminology.  I'm mid-pack at best.  Man's man.  But I'm certainly fucking head and shoulders.  You guys are in the druthers you're in.  I'm a man's man.  When I get through with the Huns and the Japs, I'm coming after you, my friend.  Just listen to the fun that we still have in our voices.  I'm a man's man.  I bring my gals silk stockings.  And I don't take any guff. 
[00:57:00]  You guys don't want to give B to the L to the S any, bunk.  Holy Toledo.  How old are you?  How old is he?  I don't know.  He's a man's man.  Ooh.  I'm a man's man.  Man's man.  And if you don't believe me, I'll go down to the canis and work out with you.  I'm not the toughest guy in the world.  I'm not the toughest guy in the world.  I'm not the toughest guy in the world.  I'm not the toughest guy in the world.  But I'm certainly fucking head and shoulders against you.  And I have a standing request. 
[00:57:30]  Here it is again.  I'll fight you anytime, anywhere.  Yeah.  On any form.  And I prefer to be like an octagon UFC kind of deal, bro.  Let's take off our fedoras and go at it.  He's bringing up the octagon.  The octagon.  Listen, brother.  That sounds really scary.  That's right.  Octagon.  Eight guns.  Is that eight guns?  Wow.  Yeah.  Why would I give you the pleasure?  The octagon.  When I know I'm just getting under your skin and driving you nuts. 
[00:58:00]  And how brave are you?  You're throwing all these threats around.  You're not even in New York City.  You're in Tampa.  You don't even broadcast from here.  Yeah.  You think I'm going to take time out of my busy life to fly down to Tampa?  You're just going to enjoy your millions.  Eight.  And are we going to work on a charity?  Are we?  Is this going to be a charity event?  Where we're beating each other up, but it's for a good cause? 
[00:58:30]  Ugh.  Ugh.  Yeah, because you'd like to sell tickets, right?  Yeah, because this is hack radio crap.  It's not going to be a Rocky Balboa, Apollo Creed, and the basement alone thing.  No.  It's going to be an octagon.  It's going to be an octagon.  And then you can't pocket the money from it, so it's got to go to your favorite charity.  And we're going to sell tickets, right?  Yeah.  And then our fans will have signs, and your fans will have signs.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Maybe we can get thunder lips. 
[00:59:00]  Hey.  Hey, charity hurts.  We got bird lips over here, so we don't need thunder lips.  No need to blow out my candle to make yours shine.  Good advice, Jimmy.  Words to live by.  That's mature.  All right.  Here we go.  Gone.  UFC kind of deal, Brent.  That's what I would prefer.  But I'll wrestle you.  I'll box you.  That sounds sexy now.  Sure does.  How the fuck am I going to wrestle a fat fuck like you? 
[00:59:30]  Let's be fair here.  How would you do it?  How the fuck?  What style?  Because even after getting your stomach stigled, you're still a fat fuck, Todd.  I say ancient Greece style, where you're both naked.  That's right.  I say a couple of men do some docking and settle this.  Why not?  How the fuck am I going to wrestle you?  You're a fat fuck still.  Yeah, I think the weight class is a little off.  It's a little off.  Why don't we be fair here, Todd?  He's a homoerotic fatso with a phony voice. 
[01:00:00]  Let's get together and settle this in a little cage.  A couple of men wrestling.  A couple of men's men.  I thought you meant Steve again.  No, no, no.  Okay.  That's not homoerotic.  That's sexual.  You know, Jimmy, you're on to something because I've threatened a lot of people in my life and I've never threatened them to a wrestling match.  I don't want to touch another man, Todd.  Yeah.  Here's what it is about fighting.  What kind of sick fantasies do you have that you want me to wrestle you?  What are you looking at?  I'll hold you down and suck your dick. 
[01:00:30]  What do you want?  What do you want?  A mud wrestle?  Or will it be an oil wrestling match, you faggot?  Here it is with fighting over the age of, I'll even go like 30, 35.  Here's the deal with fighting over that age.  You don't do it for sport unless you're a professional boxer kind of at the end of your prime.  You don't do it as a game.  You don't do it as a gag.  It's probably for life or death that you're fighting. 
[01:01:00]  Because why else are you fighting?  There's no rules to it.  And for the most part, if you get threatened where you're going to receive some kind of bodily harm,  you just shoot the person.  You get enough aggression towards you where you feel that your life is in danger  to justify deadly physical force.  And you shoot the person and the fight's over. 
[01:01:30]  Why would you fight over that age?  Is that a man's man?  Is that part of being a man's man?  Because then I am a geek and I don't understand it.  You don't know anything about being a man's man.  And I'm too skinny.  I don't have that fighter's body.  You look great after the stomach stapling.  Well, that's very good.  I just ran a few on the outside.  He's Mac on the beach.  He kicks sand in your face.  Yeah, and I'm sitting there going, hey!  See, Anthony didn't have to get his stomach stapled. 
[01:02:00]  He just said no.  He just said, you know what?  I'm not going to eat that.  You've got to put down the junk food.  That's all.  Don't have steak every night.  And I understand there's people out there that have had their stomach stapled,  and they needed to for health reasons and all that, blah, blah, blah.  I understand that.  But to say you're a man's man, a man's man doesn't get his stomach stapled.  You had a tummy tuck.  It's a glandular problem.  A man's man doesn't give a shit what he looks like  and will just continue to eat whatever the fuck he wants. 
[01:02:30]  It's my thyroid, goddammit.  Smoke whatever the fuck he wants and walk around looking like a slob.  They don't give a shit.  That's what happens.  And they still get laid and they have a great life.  That's a man's man.  Todd.  I'm a man's man.  Now get me that girdle.  I have a photo shoot.  You ex-fatsos, shut up.  Bam Bam from Texas.  What's up?  Hey, from what I hear,  Rock Hudson was a man's man also.  He certainly was.  A man's man.  And he had a fucking, 
[01:03:00]  he had a colon stapling, as it were.  And a man's man doesn't offer to wrestle another man.  Here, it was buried upside down.  Let's all wrestle just to feel how uncomfortable it would be.  But only if he could put on the wrestling outfits.  The ones that like go to mid-thigh.  And the high school ones where you'd look and go, ooh.  Yeah.  Big bulge in the front.  And those wacky ear things that you gotta put on.  Where it accents your ball bag.  Yeah.  Big ball bag rubbing on your back as he's trying to roll you over.  Like.  That's men.  Like Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July in the hot scenes. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  Before the legs went.  Wow.  Any sport with men in tights, stop it.  Let's go to Sweaty Balls.  Sweaty Balls.  Yeah, my XM radio display says people hate us as the title to your show today.  Shouldn't it be people hate Opie?  Yes.  Yeah, they could change it to that.  Okay.  That would be very flattering to me today. 
[01:04:00]  Later, boy.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh, let's go to Scott in Nebraska.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  All right.  Opie, I think you should just put your scuba gear on and go down there and whip his ass.  Now, underwater.  Oh, Jesus, Stan.  Hold on.  Stan just pulled up a picture of a high school or college wrestler in his attire.  There you go.  There's a man's man, I guess.  There's a man's man.  Oh, look at his face.  Dude, just wrestle naked.  That suit is doing nothing to cover up his junk. 
[01:04:30]  Look, could we start a thread on Wack Bag?  I rarely request anything on this program.  Uh-huh.  Can we do a man's man page on Wack Bag so I can laugh later?  Man's man, a lot of photos, a lot of photoshopping, perhaps.  Well, how do you get that picture on Wack Bag?  Let's start it with that picture.  That's a man's man.  Just give it a right-click, save picture.  Yeah, and let's send it off to Wack Bag.  Properties, get the link.  Let's start a man's man thread. 
[01:05:00]  That's a man's man.  He is the number one entrant right now.  So we could all be homo-aronic.  Let's see.  Oh, so Scott, Nebraska, what else do you have about this?  Back when I first got XM, Bubba was on 152, and I used to listen to him because there wasn't  anything else on, but before it came out public that y'all were going to be on XM, he was talking  about, just before he got fired, how great it would be for you guys and him to be on a  premium channel on XM. 
[01:05:30]  And I know some of your OCD fans can find the audio of it, but he talked to the press  about the perfect radio channel would be him, Howard, and us.  I mean, you know, he respects us and knows that we're very talented, but now that he has  to kiss Howard's ass, he wants to look good in Howard's eyes, he's going to go after us  now.  I mean, most people understand the phoniness of this whole thing.  I wouldn't be surprised if already things are peeking through, because Howard's Howard,  man, that are annoying Bubba and everybody else that works around Howard. 
[01:06:00]  It's just the way it is.  And again, this is from experience, not speculation.  We've worked with the guy.  We know what it's like.  It's no fun.  The guy is about me, me, me.  The guy is about, he even said it, in between bitching about Les Moonves, Joel Hollander,  and CBS, which is all he's doing now, jumping from talk show to talk show, where people are  having less and less interest, by the way.  All he does is talk about that. 
[01:06:30]  But then on Hannity, he was talking about how he pretty much just gave up on his family  at one point to go down in his basement and write his books and do radio and whatever.  And it's always been about him.  He lost his marriage over it, had some kind of falling out with his kids that he kind of  touched on on Hannity.  And that's because it's all about him.  Do you think if he can't relate and have a relationship with his own family, that it 
[01:07:00]  cost him his marriage, that Bubba the Love Sponge is the guy he's going to cuddle up to  and help out and make his own?  Todd, this has always been and always will be about Howard Stern.  That both channels, everything.  You're a part of something over there, but the bigger picture is just Howard.  Todd, do yourself a favor.  Distance yourself from Howie.  Yeah.  It's probably best if you can keep the gig.  Keep the gig.  And distance yourself from Howie.  You'll be better off in the end.  It will definitely be advantageous to you when this falls apart or when he pisses you off 
[01:07:30]  too much or when he fires you or whatever.  Right.  And I'm not making guarantees that that's going to happen.  I guarantee that Opie and Anthony will be off the air.  Really.  Can I, Jimmy?  Do ya?  Do ya.  Do ya.  Guarantee it.  Do ya.  Yeah.  Our suggestion, a little help, distance yourself.  And thanks to the PES out there because they're fighting these battles all over the place  that we don't even know about. 
[01:08:00]  I saw another one where people are convinced that XM is going to fire us and people are  writing back and fighting back and I appreciate it.  The other thing, this whole premium channel thing they'd love to jump on that we were a  failure on the premium channel.  I believe when we went on the premium channel, right when we went on, we were on it because  we were failures.  Then when we were off it, we were off it because we were failures.  I don't get it.  We were such failures that XM decided to expose us to the entire platform. 
[01:08:30]  I guess if that's being a failure, I want to be a failure every time.  It was a great way for XM, not great for us, we didn't like it right from the start.  I mean, we wanted to be on the whole platform.  But for them to put their toe in the water, as it were, they wanted to test it out, see  if we were going to get people on board, see if there was going to be some kind of backlash.  And when the backlash didn't happen and they saw that people were signing up and interested 
[01:09:00]  in the show, we got ourselves off of the premium.  That is what happened.  It's nothing about, oh my God, they're failing.  Take them off.  Oh my God, they're failing.  Keep them on.  Let's go to DougoutDoug.  Doug!  What's up?  It's Doug the No Voice Guy, because we have to have our the name when we're fighting with  Howard and his channel and Bubba and all that shit.  Everyone's got a the something, right.  Well, Friday is a good test. 
[01:09:30]  Let's see how many Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge fans we have come assault us.  If we only have five fans, they've got to have a lot more.  Let's see who shows up at the Hard Rock on Friday to fuck with us, because it's a good  opportunity for them.  You've got the commanders in chief, you three guys sitting there.  You're going to have all the fucking asshole generals in one room.  Let's have these guys all come and tell us how much of a bunch of losers we are right to  our faces.  And then if they have a lot of them, I say fighting is not the answer. 
[01:10:00]  You settle things the way you settle them in radio, guys.  It's the age-old way to settle things and prove a point in radio.  We sit on billboards as long as we can and eat nothing but Whoppers and see how long we  can stay on top of a billboard.  Because that's how you settle stuff, baby.  They do it from my own town.  I'll do it here in Virginia Beach.  We'll have somebody else do it up in New York.  We'll fucking sit on billboards.  Yeah, brother! 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to live on a billboard!  Right, until my sports team wins.  My favorite sports team.  Oh, God.  That old gag.  Yeah, we're doing a live broadcast this Friday at the Hard Rock Cafe for St. Paddy's Day.  Bubba, you know where I'm going to be.  Simple as that.  Come on down.  You brave fuck.  We'll have a couple of drinks.  Let's see how brave you are.  Sure.  They've got nothing.  Shut your fucking fat trap, Todd.  I don't know how many...  And just stay in fucking Tampa. 
[01:11:00]  I don't know how much of the audio you guys listen to from the Letterman thing yet, but  when they had people chanting O&A and then they asked how many Howard fans there were  from the video from yesterday, and one guy yelled.  Where's the video clips from the attack on Howard yesterday?  Are they up on opiananthony.com yet?  I think they're up on opiananthony.com.  I just saw the link.  We're going to get to that a little later today, and I got to thank Bam and No Filter  Paul and the rest of the guys. 
[01:11:30]  I was an eyewitness.  You guys were un-fucking-believable yesterday.  Yes, that's true.  I was down there checking it out from afar myself, and when you guys chased the limo,  I couldn't have been prouder.  I was laughing my fucking ass off, and then the limo gets stuck at us.  They got a red light, and they completely surrounded the limo, and Howard had to sit there and  take it.  And then the limo took off, tires screeching.  Right, like they're trying to get-  Get me out of here, right?  Get me out of here. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, they're getting the limo out of there like they're trying to get Kennedy to a fucking  hospital.  What's wrong, Howard?  What's wrong?  You couldn't take it?  You told Ronnie to step on it?  Step on it, Ronnie!  Step on it!  Wait a second, hold on.  It's Ronnie, the limo driver!  Get it?  Because he drives the limo.  I'm Doug as a no-voice guy, because I don't have a voice right now.  You get it?  It's fucking hilarious.  It really is, Doug. 
[01:12:30]  It's hilarious.  Bam is a fucking psychopath.  I don't know how many movies you watched where they have that renegade cop that everybody  fucking hates, but you love to have him on your squad because he's a psycho.  That's Bam.  Bam is completely out for himself, but he is fucking out of his mind and gets the job done  better than I've ever fucking seen it.  He's a loose cannon.  Bam is a creepy, unshaven problem in slacks.  Bam is a fucking wacko.  I gotta tell you about the PES. 
[01:13:00]  They are playing their role perfectly these days.  They're not getting in trouble.  They're just annoying the fuck out of people.  Yeah, visually.  They are playing this perfectly and continue with this, guys.  Yep.  And every time Howard mentions the army, the army, they have five army members.  That is you guys getting under his skin.  You guys getting under his skin.  What's wrong there, Doug?  Guys, I just realized, and I'm gonna punch out because I made a big mistake.  Like, Bubba, we're really sorry we got off talking about you, and we're talking about 
[01:13:30]  the more important guy.  So we'll let you guys go back to talking about Bubba.  It always happens.  We always end up talking about Howie because, Bubba, you ain't fucking shit.  Get it through your fucking head, Mr. Midday.  All right.  All right.  Thank you there, Doug.  Bye, sweetie.  Thank you.  Yes, I was down there, and I checked it out live, and it was hilarious what was going  on.  Is there audio?  Of what?  Outside from all that.  Yeah, there's video clips and stuff that Bam sent Steve.  They should be up on opianthony.com soon. 
[01:14:00]  There was one point where Howard turned around to wave to his fans, realized it was all Opie  and Anthony people, and they quickly turned around and ran into the theater.  It was the funniest fucking thing.  The funniest.  He just assumed they were there for him, so he turns around because he's so fucking out  of touch.  He has no clue.  He turns around, and it's all Opie and Anthony people screaming in his face.  He went, oh, there it is right there.  Oof.  You know.  Ouch. 
[01:14:30]  It's all about Allison.  Yeah, the latest banners they got.  It's all about Allison.  She's my best friend.  And then everyone copies me.  Hoo-hoo.  And then it says Opie and Anthony Satellite Radio.  I can't see.  Something pioneers.  Original pioneers, maybe.  And they get new signs every time they show up and bother him.  And then we have audio of Bam stepping right up to Howard at the end of this.  Gotcha, the maligno.  Be careful. 
[01:15:00]  We don't want a lawsuit.  Of course not.  Just because we're having fun.  See, we get to have fun again, Howard.  Let's see.  How many serious signs?  None.  No.  None.  It's all XM, Opie and Anthony signs.  Again.  And then there's them chasing the line.  No.  Fucking psychopaths.  Step on it, Ronnie.  They're chasing me.  Get me to a hospital. 
[01:15:30]  I have a head wound.  Really are just complete pests.  Can we move on here?  Sure.  UFC kind of deal, Brent.  That's what I would prefer.  But I'll wrestle you.  I'll box you.  I'll UFC you.  Will you?  I'll do whatever you want.  It doesn't matter to the Jesus.  I'll come up to your town, New York City, where you live, and beat your fucking ass to the ground.  Or I'll go to Washington, D.C., where you guys are based out of, and beat your fucking ass to the ground. 
[01:16:00]  Will ya?  Stop being a pussy.  Will ya?  And hiding behind your microphone.  Will ya?  And man the fuck up.  Will ya?  Man the fuck up.  If you're going to talk shit, then you better be able to back it up.  Will ya?  Or get your ass kicked trying to back it up.  His whole life.  Or if you want to go to Hacks Interns vs Interns, get 20-year interned, and I'll send Coco the glorified fucking monkey over there.  And just let us know how many days of convalescent leave you want to take.  Will said Sam.  That's right.  Sam.  Toby.  With a Travis backup, just in case. 
[01:16:30]  That's right.  That's a hell of a tag team.  That's right.  One will snake his way into your cock hole, and the other one hides up your anus.  Those two svelte gentlemen.  Bubba could eat them.  That's it.  He would eat one, and then use the other one as a toothpick.  Why don't you get a little Travis out of your teeth?  Being a man's man, I'm sure he'd love to eat Travis.  Yeah.  I challenge you.  We'll oil each other up.  A couple of men oil each other up after we shave each other's bodies. 
[01:17:00]  Like eels.  Two eels with hard-ons.  Two erect eels.  Like men drinking pabst.  Opie.  Yes.  Man the fuck up.  Man up.  Everyone knows where I'm going to be on Friday.  Simple as that.  Manning up, I hope.  Simple as that.  His whole life is a Don Johnson movie dialogue.  Man up.  You fucking cornball.  Shut up.  Man up.  Can I have a tummy tuck, please?  I'm a little chubby.  Everyone knows where I'll be Friday.  Play that challenge, that fight challenge.  Everybody knows.  I'm going to put the Miami Vice music behind it. 
[01:17:30]  I've got to hear what that sounds like in that context.  Oh, easy.  Because it really is like 80s style Miami Vice kind of dialogue.  It's Harley and the Marlboro Man.  What a douche.  You got it, Derek?  Hold on.  I don't know if I got it here.  Let's see.  On any form.  And I'd prefer to be like...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm going to hear this.  Kick some ass.  I'm not the toughest guy in the world.  Probably mid-pack at best.  But I'm certainly fucking head and shoulders against you. 
[01:18:00]  And I have a standing request.  I'll fight you anytime, anywhere, on any form.  And I'd prefer to be like an octagon UFC kind of deal.  That's what I would prefer.  But I'll wrestle you.  I'll box you.  I'll UFC you.  I'll do whatever you want.  It doesn't matter to the Jesus.  Come up to your town, New York City, where you live, and beat your fucking ass to the ground.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba. 
[01:18:30]  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Bring it on, brother.  Bring it on.  And man the fuck up.  Yeah.  If you're going to talk shit, then you better be able to back it up.  Yeah, Chubbs.  Yeah.  Or if you want to go to Hacks Interns vs. Interns, get your one-year interned, and I'll send Coco the glorified fucking monkey over there.  And roll center.  Just show us how many days of convalescent leading the intern.  I love it with the music.  That's really like an 80s kind of challenge thing he's doing there. 
[01:19:00]  Dude, he is.  Very cool.  What a cornball.  I swear to God, he is a cornball.  Well, at least, come on.  The guy's got to be a little grateful that at least we're giving him some listeners today.  Yes.  Because, really, let's be honest here.  We want to talk radio honesty.  A lot more people are listening to this program here than yours.  All right, I have a response, and I want to do it.  Oh, a response.  I have a response, and I want to do it in song, if you will, okay? 
[01:19:30]  In song.  Are you going to sing again?  I'd like what you sing.  What is this, West Side Story?  He's challenging in song fashion.  Yes.  Yes.  You're going to snap?  Yes.  I box you just don't punch me in my stomach, Staples.  Come on, guys.  Man up.  The sharks are coming.  Come on.  Wow, this is going to scare the shit out of them. 
[01:20:00]  Opie, calm down.  Easy.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  You're a great big phony.  You know that?  That's right.  You're a big, fat phony. 
[01:20:30]  Yes, I am gay.  I'm scared of you.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  I'm scared.  You will keep your hands off of my mule.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Let me kiss you on the mouth.  I really want to make me cry.  You want to kiss me or? 
[01:21:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  This is great ice, Steve.  I could have wasted thousands of years.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes stays, lays, or prays.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still popping.  I'm coming through the head and care.  Oh, those guys are back. 
[01:21:30]  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  You damn asshole.  You have something to say?  I have something to say.  All right?  So let's just, let's just talk.  How long is that?  You're not being fair.  This isn't fair.  I was fine. 
[01:22:00]  I did so many things.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  You can get a dog and stand in the middle and on your side.  Those are your only choices.  My house and I get the same.  Hello, folk faith. 
[01:22:30]  The boy fights for the pink team.  There's my response.  Wow.  Thank you.  Tough guy.  Wow.  With some boy joy.  You're an ass.  Just because we're still having fun.  Others in this business don't know how to have fun anymore.  It does seem to be...  You guys are the most time taken off, motherfuckers, in the whole entire world. 
[01:23:00]  And you just got thrown off, or you're in the process of getting thrown off.  DirecTV.  That's something you guys don't even know about yet.  Really?  Yeah.  So build your little torture rack and realize that these satellite listeners are very smart.  And you know what?  Your little Opie fucking and Anthony pest control, or whatever the fuck you call it.  If you're an Opie and Anthony fan, you're a real fag.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'd love to see my listeners.  All right.  Look.  For your own safety, you really can rag on us, and it's fun and whatever. 
[01:23:30]  It's cute and everything.  But, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't.  Don't do it.  I'm begging you, please, don't even mention the pest.  There.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, now you had to open up that can of worms.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Now we are truly scared.  All right.  For you.  All right.  Well, he said it, so he might as well upplay it.  I guess, just in case you guys didn't hear that. 
[01:24:00]  There are fags in there.  Oh, no.  Something about being a fag or something.  Whatever the fuck you call it.  If you're an Opie and Anthony fan, you're a real fag.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'd love to see my listeners and Howard's listeners fucking in like a Braveheart kind of deal.  How funny is that?  Yeah.  How funny is that that he had to go, my listeners, and then, uh-oh, and Howard listeners, because  obviously I don't have enough listeners to take on that.  Yeah.  You're such an asshole, Todd. 
[01:24:30]  I'd like to see the Nambian Army and the United States Army.  Fuck it.  Stop it.  I'd like to see my listener and Howard's listeners.  Ugh, what a worm.  I would like to take the French Army and the Korean Army.  And, dude, who is this guy fucking Ned on his show that doesn't exist?  Hawk, who is that, a phony fucking guy that does not exist that they make the producer does  some phony voice and they hire a guy to sign autographs? 
[01:25:00]  I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't tell you.  There's a guy Ned on that show.  It's a phony voice and they hire a guy to play him when he goes out.  Really?  What a fucking fool.  Like our Jimmy Norton character.  There is no Jimmy.  Do you think somebody could be that mushy and like trannies and still drive a caddy?  I don't think so.  Paddy Jimmy shows up.  Yeah.  Well, let's...  He's real.  Let's continue this here.  Yeah.  Well, you can be...  You know what?  I'd love to see my listeners and Howard's listeners fucking in like a Braveheart kind  of deal fight your guys's. 
[01:25:30]  Like you would whip your fucking ass.  Kilts?  You know what?  You're...  You know what their listeners...  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Like kilts with our balls hanging out?  Again, it's a little homoerotic.  They show their asses to each other beforehand and...  What about just a stand-up fight?  I'd like to see our listeners and Opie and Anthony's listeners in a chariot of fire kind  of thing.  In a Philadelphia kind of situation.  Why not?  What is wrong with him?  What a faggot.  Dude, you want people to think that you have a huge audience. 
[01:26:00]  So wouldn't it just be your fans against our fans?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Do I have to explain this to you?  You dope.  Your faithful listeners aren't buying into it.  They know if you have to say my listeners and Howard listeners.  That means you don't have enough listeners.  Yeah.  You can't be this dumb.  Well, apparently you can.  A Braveheart kind of deal fight your guys' because we would whip your fucking ass. 
[01:26:30]  Can we paint our faces?  You know what their listeners are?  Computer fucking nerds.  Just like those two.  All right.  Computer geek fucking nerds are exactly what those two are and that's who listens to them.  All right.  I'll give them the listeners and me.  Not Opie.  Nope.  Opie's not.  But our listeners, a lot of them, yeah, computer nerds, computer geeks.  Nope.  Right.  I'm too busy building bombs in my basement.  Right. 
[01:27:00]  I'm a computer geek.  I'll give them that too.  I'll be honest.  I love computers.  They're fun.  They're a great way to keep informed and keep in contact with your fans.  Yeah.  You ought to give it a try.  Oh, Opie.  Not the Vicodin.  Not my doll.  Not the Vicodin again.  Intervention time.  Are you chewing that?  You don't chew those. 
[01:27:30]  You're a man's man.  Why don't you come down here?  Why don't you have a little moxie and come on down?  I'll cut Z's in your cheeks.  I'll cut Z's the marketer squealer.  Here we go.  Not dudes.  Not guys who like wrestling and racing and chasing whores.  No.  And drinking fucking Miller Lite.  What?  Hey, hey, I've had a like beer.  I have, bucko. 
[01:28:00]  And not like wrestling and chasing whores.  That's all that fucking fruit Eric does is look at wrestlers and all I do is chase whores.  What are you talking about?  And let me tell you something.  And we don't like racing, you know.  No.  That's why we're not having Jimmy Johnson on tomorrow to do our show.  You know, he's only the best NASCAR racer there is these days.  He's not going to be on our show tomorrow because we hate racing.  If you're drinking Miller Lite and watching NASCAR, you're not chasing babes. 
[01:28:30]  Well, you might be chasing them, but they're running really fast away from you.  Did he really say Miller Lite?  Yeah.  A man's man.  A man's man.  I can't believe we have.  Whiskey, leave the bottle.  I can't believe we've got to keep pointing this shit out.  A man's man would never admit that he drinks a light beer.  What a fag.  Hey, you want to be a man's man, get together and have a hot toddy.  When you're with your friends and you're the guy that wants to drink a light beer, you  always kind of whisper that order to the waitress.  Cosmos for everybody. 
[01:29:00]  Come on, man up and have a Manhattan.  Give me that umbrella for my drink.  I would say a man's man's drink, if you want to go for beer or something, it's probably a  Guinness.  A Guinness.  If you're a good Irish, you're going to get a little tank down there and probably have  a fight and throw up.  That's a man's man.  What else does this man's man enjoy?  I like to get together and felch some cum out of an ass.  That's what a man's man does.  I have my tummy stabled and felch a load out of someone's ass. 
[01:29:30]  A man's man is not scared of cum.  I want to challenge.  I gargle with it.  I want to challenge both programs, a challenge, who can make the biggest AIDS quilt?  A man's man.  A brave heart situation.  A brave heart situation.  Corn ball.  Oh, we'll challenge you.  We'll challenge you to some LARPing.  Yes, can we LARP?  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I'm casting spells with beanbags. 
[01:30:00]  We have all our LARPing weapons in the office.  LARPing gear.  I have my wizard hat.  And I think I could take him.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  What's your damage up to?  Who's skipping track?  I'm casting a spell.  Five damage.  And you're rooted.  You can't move.  I think you need to fall down because you have enough damage.  Right.  And chasing whores.  No, and drinking fucking Miller Lite.  These guys. 
[01:30:30]  Football and college NCAA.  No.  Yeah.  Your guys are little Bill Gates computer fucking pest hack fucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Suck a dick, you little cocksuckers.  Yeah.  Okay.  And you know what?  Take my challenge.  Take my challenge.  Shalom.  Opie.  Take it.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Just say no.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[01:31:00]  I can't read any of this.  Cafe Cafe Cafe.  Opie, if you agree to any of this, just say yes.  Yes.  When you see me, just say yes.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Give me a definitive reason as to why you don't hide me.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  You're not better than me on radio.  You said say yes.  You don't make more money than me.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Because for the most part, he don't talk no shit.  No, for the most part, he knows his fucking role.  Yeah, I don't talk no shit.  But it's that little fuck that tries to be so cocky and so tough.  I've been honest about everything I've said this morning. 
[01:31:30]  He's right.  I don't talk any shit.  That's right.  I've been completely honest and spelt it out, I think, a way everyone can understand  about having some dignity with your show and what we do here and what you're doing over there.  I think it was spelled out.  Thank you for that, because I am being completely honest, and I wasn't talking any shit.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  That tune is so catchy.  It's stuck in my head. 
[01:32:00]  According to the people over there, we only have four or five listeners, so it shouldn't  be a threatening situation.  The Army.  Right, Todd?  It's only four or five.  They won't even get involved.  Sit on the sidelines and watch.  That's right.  You better call JetBlue.  You better call JetBlue.  You have a flight to book.  Right.  You have a flight to book.  Bubba.  It's down.  It's going down.  You know, somebody who talks like him you'd think look like Hogan or Coco or Craig the  Bulldog or somebody that's tough.  Or Cook and Duck Billy.  Beat with a camera tripod in a hotel room? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, the other.  Right.  What you meant from Hogan's Heroes.  Sorry.  Head caved in and a hard-on.  Pervert.  A big one, though.  Guy's my hero.  I have something you don't have.  Uh-oh.  Psychosis.  Oh.  Psychosis.  Hallucinations.  Hallucinations.  Occasionally.  And a great body.  Delusions.  What's that called? 
[01:33:00]  What?  Dementia.  Yeah.  Some dementia thrown in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  You know, somebody who talks like him you'd think look like Hogan or Coco or Craig the Bulldog  or somebody that's tough.  Or Cook and Duck Billy.  What?  Not a character, I guess.  Not somebody that looks like that little puss.  People who talk that much shit, you know, looks like, you know, Joe Varillo or Fabrizi  or some, you know, Mark Rush.  Some stud, right?  Zito. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Some stud.  Oh, my God.  Was he mentioning hot guys?  Because I didn't recognize one of those names.  Dudes, let me tell you a little something about me.  I hate to admit it.  I couldn't name you one stud.  I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't do it.  Let me think.  Gun to my head, I couldn't name one stud.  Because I'm not looking at other men, faggot.  Stud.  Can you name a stud?  I'm trying to think of a stud.  Name one stud, Anthony.  The pressure's on.  A stud isn't just like a Hollywood guy, because that's not a stud, is it? 
[01:34:00]  A stud's a man's man in real life.  A man's man.  In real life.  Right.  Viral.  Right.  You know, a guy with a really good body, because he notices guys with really good bodies.  Name one.  A stud.  A stud.  All right, Patrice's pal there, the English guy.  Gavin.  Gavin is a stud.  That's right.  Sam.  There you go.  I say Sam.  We all have different tastes.  You like the thin boy, boyish figure? 
[01:34:30]  Yes, I like the waif.  I like large black men.  We can agree to disagree.  And they'll look at the clock and see what time I said that, so they could jot it down  for the next promo, assholes.  Even with Gavin, who's what, like 6'9", 300, not an ounce of fat on him, you wouldn't  look at him and go, wow, what a stud.  Opie, the name stud, or word stud, never came into my mind when I was looking at Gavin,  talking to him.  You would look at him, what would you think?  Holy shit, that guy could kick some ass.  That guy's gonna kick some ass, right.  I would never go, hey, Gavin, you're a stud. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Ugh.  Not in public.  A stud.  Ugh.  A real stud.  Joe Varillo, or Fabrizi, or some, you know, Bob Norton.  Jim Norton, some stud, right?  Chuck Zito.  Yeah, Chuck Zito talks that much shit.  And Opie, Opie, not some little fucking pussy like you.  With a neck like a stack of dimes, and arms like a garden hose.  Hey, that one again.  Wow.  Anthony, don't, I'm sorry, Opie.  Opie, don't be a little pussy.  Just say yes. 
[01:35:30]  Man, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe Friday for our same-  So I can beat your ass like you're stealing chickens, you little fuck.  And we don't have a lot of listeners, so it should be a great situation.  And if you're not gonna say yes, and you're gonna call me names,  and you're gonna call me a fat ass, and Jabba the Hutt,  and everything else you call me, then at least fight me.  Just fight me.  Just say yes.  Anything else in closing?  Ned, anything in closing?  BTLS.com.  What's there, Ned?  The Ned-only CD.  Right.  Get it today.  That's a fake guy. 
[01:36:00]  That's a character.  Nope, that's it.  That was just that guy.  Dude, it's not a real-  This fucking hack, he called this show Hacks.  Yeah.  Is a fake character.  Now, I know it sounds like we're fake characters,  but this producer really does run around with his face  in more white stuff than a shovel.  Fucking Steve really is that perfectly enunciating boob that we paint him out to be.  Right.  These guys exist as we say they do.  You fucking phony. 
[01:36:30]  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  You really are.  He locks himself in his house over the weekend.  Anything with a J, whether they're germs or Jews,  you don't want them near you.  Oh, Jigaboo.  Yeah, that works too.  Okay.  Well, I want to thank Todd for playing right into our hands again,  and I want to thank him because I get off on this.  I know for a fact I got under your skin again.  Yeah, Opie personally enjoys things like this.  Certainly do, and I will be at the Hard Rock Cafe this Friday 
[01:37:00]  for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Is that another man's man?  Oh, that's the character with the fake beard, the wig, and the headband thing?  Is that what I'm seeing there?  Wow, what a cornball.  It's radio, dude.  I don't really get it.  Can someone explain this thing to me?  I don't get it.  Hawk, do you want to explain it?  It's a bug.  It's a bug.  Yeah.  Is that the guy on the show?  Yeah, it's the voice on the show.  He's supposed to be this old, crazy, racist, redneck guy down in Florida, 
[01:37:30]  and it's really his producer doing the voice,  and they hire an old guy to show up at the events to sign photos.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  I think it's kind of crazy.  Liddy.  You can't do Liddy anymore.  I got rid of the lids on the yogurt tops.  Oh, no.  I better man up.  Do Toppy.  Don't do Toppy.  No, no, no, no, no.  Brr.  Oh, Toppy's got a deep voice. 
[01:38:00]  He's a man's lid.  Brr.  Toppy sounds a little retarded.  Ooh, Toppy's a stud.  Lift weights and duck.  Brr.  Shit.  Oh, my God.  You fuck Toppy?  Did Toppy fuck my wife?  Brr.  Let's go to Brother Joe.  Hey, kids.  Hey, brother Joe.  Hey, I would love to volunteer to kick that fuck's ass on his home turf in Florida. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  On St. Patrick's Day.  Right.  In fact, I can do it in between sets at the Hard Rock Cafe in Lauderdale when 2U goes down  to play on St. Patrick's Day.  Wait, what Hard Rock Cafe?  Your phone crapped out.  Lauderdale.  Oh, sorry, man.  Oh, Lauderdale?  Lauderdale.  Yeah, Fort Lauderdale.  Lauderdale.  Hard Rock Cafe.  See, Todd's not going to be in Florida, though, because he's going to be on JetBlue flying 
[01:39:00]  up to New York.  Right.  To kick my ass.  Maybe I'll kick his ass on the connecting flight.  And what does a guy wear to an ass kicking?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  You've got to get some ass kicking clothes.  Those ain't it.  I wear a big boot to put up his fat ass.  Well, that would be funny.  You walk around with a big boot on one foot.  This is going up your ass, my friend.  Vaseline on the tip.  Yeah, you wear those wrestling tights.  Guys, I swear to God, man, I had the weirdest fucking dream last night that I had to jump 
[01:39:30]  in on a fight, a physical fight that you were having with Howard.  This is totally coincidence.  Last night, I had that dream that I jumped in on a fight that you were having with Howard  and kicked his ass.  I don't know, man.  It was just a weird coincidence.  There would be no way he would even get near any of us.  He would run away just for, like, fear of, I don't know, germs.  He's an ass.  Fort Lauderdale, when? 
[01:40:00]  That's on St. Paddy's Day.  St. Paddy's Day.  For our Florida listeners, the 2U, one of the premier U2 tribute band.  And for more information, you hit notutube.com.  Wonderful, Joe.  I'll talk to you soon, man.  All right, and I will kick Bubba's ass.  Bye, Dollface.  By the way, he wants to do an intern fight.  Yes, we will send our intern, Poe.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  We'll fight one of his interns. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  Our intern's name is Poe.  Our intern, Poe.  Intern Poe.  Because it's short, because Poet was too long.  That's right.  So we just shortened it to Poe, but he does poetry.  That's right.  And he likes singing Lionel Richie songs.  That's right.  And we'd put him up against any of your interns.  Of course we will.  Yeah.  Poe.  I'm so scared that I will not announce that I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe this Friday  for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast. 
[01:41:00]  Because only a dummy would announce where he's going to be.  If you were...  If he was scared, right.  So scared.  Only a dummy would do that.  Now I'm scared.  Are you scared?  Yeah, I'm scared.  Are you really scared?  Because I'm a computer geek.  I just hide behind my keyboard.  I'll be in Atlanta so I don't have to worry about the tornado coming up here and hitting  me.  You bastard.  You're not even going to be around.  I don't want to be nowhere near that whirlwind when he shows up with his listeners. 
[01:41:30]  We better have a buffet at the Hard Rock Cafe for Bubba.  Ah.  Just don't punch me in my staples.  You can hit me in the face or chin.  Just don't punch my staples.  Will there be ground rules like that, you think?  No staple punching.  No staple punching.  Yeah.  No pinching my fat before they cut it off.  Yuck.  Fucking.  You fat glutton.  You fucking grabbing for more than your share gluttonous pig.  Your depression because you were off the air.  When do you try to kill a pig on the air?  That was a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
[01:42:00]  He's always been fat.  How has he really?  Yeah, he's always been feeding his fat face.  Always shoving more than he shared at his throat.  Always overcompensating.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  I can't say no.  And they say that's...  Psychological.  Yeah, they say that's hiding something.  It's probably a molested...  Hopefully he was molested.  Let's hope he was.  Yeah.  And what a lot of fat people do is because they were sexually abused, they try to very subconsciously  make themselves ugly so nobody will find them sexually attractive again and hurt them  that way.  Was he a cute little lad maybe like Jimmy? 
[01:42:30]  He might have been.  Tussleable hair.  And I bet you that's where all those homoerotic references came.  Maybe some sort of a close relative or a neighbor or somebody trusted would sneak in and the BLS  moniker would be, you know, come on baby, let's suck.  That's what that would be.  It would be hold that little fat face and open it and put that man's mule into it.  And the whole thing with the fighting and the, you know, be a man up and stuff, that's too...  It's too macho.  Absolutely.  It's too over the top. 
[01:43:00]  Like, let me go way over this way so I can stay as far away from the other side of the spectrum,  which is, you know, gayness.  That really, and I'm not, I'm no Sigmund Freud over here, but that's pretty standard stuff.  The more you try to come off as a real tough guy, the less tolerant you are to the other side  and the, maybe the closer you are to the other side trying to distance yourself. 
[01:43:30]  Well, we can all agree that we hate the faggots.  Hey, you know, if we can all just shake on one thing in this world...  Why don't we get interns to fight?  We'll get our, let's get our favorite hookers to fight.  Right.  You bring your hooker, bubba, and I'll bring mine, and mine will tear a wig off and hit you right with a dick.  By the way, that was a joke.  We love our faggots.  Absolutely.  Of course we do.  They're terrific.  They certainly are.  They make nice clothes.  All right, let's get out of here for a little while. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, everybody!  Hey, sir!  My sir!  Just call my name, because I hear you scream!  My sir!  My sir!  Keep trying to figure us out.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  I want to thank the faithful listeners of this program for supporting us on a daily basis. 
[01:44:30]  The show is getting more gooder because of you, and we thank you.  We don't thank them enough, Anthony.  Ah, fuck them.  We don't thank them enough.  I guess Imus was talking about us.  Yeah.  He wants to call me or something.  Really?  Yeah, and...  Do you want to fight you?  It says, uh, this is the latest post on the New York Radio Message Board. 
[01:45:00]  Uh-huh.  The mecca of all...  The mecca of all radio message boards.  Alan Sniffin.  It's, uh, Imus.  Do we have audio of this?  Maybe someone could send us the audio.  Uh, yeah.  Imus just mentioned that he's going to call Opie, who he said had called him once before.  Imus mentioned something about needing to talk some sense into Opie.  Uh-oh.  My dad's getting involved.  Oh, boy.  Uh, yesterday, Imus had mentioned how he had purchased a good deal of stock in Sirius at 
[01:45:30]  a low price and that he really wanted Howard Stern to succeed there because of it.  I'm wondering if he's worried that Opie's rumored forthcoming presence on CBS radio will  be a boon to XM if it happens and have a substantially negative impact on Sirius.  He's just doing it.  He's trying to manipulate you for his stock?  Get the SEC.  If this is all true, big if, then I guess the whole scenario is making for strange bedfellows.  Imus and Stern may put Opie and Anthony, who Imus has seemed to like, on the opposite side 
[01:46:00]  of his fence if they land at CBS.  A lot of rumors.  A lot of speculation out there, Anthony.  Plenty.  Plenty.  And we've said what we have to say about that today anyway, right?  We have to, what we can at this time.  Things like that.  All right.  Let's go to General Bam.  General Bam.  Hey, what's up?  Sorry to make you wait so long there, Bam. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that's fine.  Don't worry about it.  I was driving.  Drawing radio.  You know how this works, right?  Yeah.  We answer the phone.  You're on it.  And then you talk about something.  What's up, man?  All right.  With those brown rules, I think we're ready to go.  How about we try again?  All right.  Start over.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to put them on hold and everything.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, let's go to the phones.  Oh. 
[01:47:00]  Hello?  Hi, General Bam.  How are you today?  General Bam on the phone.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  I just got to say, I realized yesterday at our attack on Stern that it is no longer 1994.  Yeah, right.  I mean, 1994, we would not be walking out of there alive.  We outnumbered his fans by more than 5 to 1.  Yeah, I saw it for myself.  I was down there, Bam.  You guys did a great job. 
[01:47:30]  More than 5 to 1.  But I just have to say, No Filter Paul is a fucking MVP of this attack.  What did he do?  For all the shit we give him, he did an amazing job.  Well, if he did such an amazing job, wouldn't he be calling us to tell us?  Because that's what No Filter Paul does.  Well, I think he has to work.  Oh, okay.  Well, what did he do?  Howard is such a pussy and so afraid that he showed up at 3.30 for a 5 p.m. taping. 
[01:48:00]  He showed up earlier than anyone else shows up.  No, no.  For that show.  He was trying to avoid the whole O&A pest thing outside Letterman.  I heard about this, by the way.  So he showed up at 3.30.  No one shows up at Letterman at 3.30.  No one.  And the pests were already there, by the way.  Yeah, so we were staging at that time, and No Filter Paul would notice the limo there  and got us there in time to assault Howard on the way in.  And you could see this scowl on Howard's face. 
[01:48:30]  He wasn't.  Yeah, well, there's nothing he could do about it because he doesn't have the passion to fight  back anymore.  He would actually have to communicate with his own fans.  He doesn't want to do that.  He had five fans there.  That's it.  Most of the people there were there to carry underwear.  Yeah.  In the way, Howard Stern.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The pathetic his show has become, he doesn't have the listeners he once had.  He's a mere shadow of himself.  And the best part, Howard thought those people were there for him, and he turned around to 
[01:49:00]  wave to everyone and realized quickly that it was all Opie and Anthony fans with banners  and went, ah, fuck, not again.  And he ran into the studio.  O&A fans and Carrie Underwood fans.  Jesus Christ.  Well, that would be a better challenge, I think.  We'll take on the Carrie Underwood fans.  Let me tell you, brother.  Because we're all a bunch of nerds.  We'll even go against Clay Aiken fans.  Bring them all on.  Ooh.  All right, Bam.  Well, we got some pictures and, I guess, audio. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  And I just noticed that Paul again at the end, getting that wow sticker on Howard's Lomo  on the way.  You know they had a scream.  You know how, like...  Like a parking violation sticker.  Right, right.  You know when the lights fade and the limo's somewhere on a side street, they have to get  out of the fucking limo and scrape it off.  Annoying bastards you are.  Oh, that's great.  He got stuck at that light, and we were right pressed up against the side of his limo with 
[01:50:00]  the, hey, Howard, did your daughter have fun at Jingle Ball 2000 banner?  You could see him inside.  Bam.  I got to tell you again.  I saw the whole thing, and it was so funny to me.  And it was also very obvious that Howard couldn't take it to the point where he actually  told his limo driver to step on it.  Step on it.  Nice job, Lou.  I mean, his limo driver at the line was, like, pumping the brakes.  Going to Noble?  Maybe.  Trying to see if he could run the lights. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry, but I interrupted you.  What did you say?  Yeah, I was just pumping the brakes at the light, the limo driver.  Trying to run that light, seeing if he could get through just to get away from us.  I can only imagine how bad Howard was yelling in that limo at him.  And by the way, that's why Howard's not talking about this today, because, you know, he knows  it's a real problem.  And this is just a platoon.  We didn't even say to go down there.  These guys are doing all this on their own.  If we said to go down there, there would probably be a couple hundred people minimum that would 
[01:51:00]  like...  There's a couple of emails I sent out and private messages I sent out over the weekend.  Yeah.  There you go.  So, just want to make sure that the generals, as part of our compensation package, are going  to get the VIP treatment this Friday.  You'll be lucky to get in the door.  Oh, did I say that?  What am I, nuts?  Of course.  You guys will be well taken care of.  Yes.  They're celebrities in their own right.  They walk around and everyone's like, oh my God, that's Ben.  The only thing I'm lying is the basic answer. 
[01:51:30]  All right, Ben, we got to go.  We're going to actually try to do something different today.  Hi.  Take it easy.  Thanks, Ian.  Apparently, some people are bitching about the sound again on this channel.  Really?  Yeah.  It's like going up and down a little, I guess.  Great.  And some of our mics all of a sudden will be low and then be normal.  Oh, that's good.  People fucking with stuff maybe down in D.C.  Why don't you check your new portable unit?  Hear how it sounds.  You can hear it for yourself. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, that would be weird.  Let me try to do the whole show listening to our show on a huge delay.  Don't tell me that they're making adjustments as we do a live broadcast.  I don't know.  That would be par for the course, actually.  That's a nice little unit.  Let's talk to Paul.  Let's go to the no filter Paul.  Paul?  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Paul.  I had a great assault yesterday.  I had bang to do.  I gave you all the details.  Yeah.  But you mentioned that there's a picture in the New York Post with me and Matt holding  a sign in the background of Howie with his little Les Moonves t-shirt. 
[01:52:30]  Well, to be completely honest, we know what it is.  And it made us laugh.  It's not that obvious in the post, but you got Howard and then in the background you see  like part of my name, part of Anthony's name, and XM.  It's one of the banners you guys were holding up.  Yeah, that was it.  I just wanted to mention that.  I don't know if you managed to mention that.  Yeah, that was all.  Yeah, very good.  No problem, guys.  Have a good day.  Great job, man.  We have better pictures on opianthony.com of what happened outside Letterman Studios.  All right, Paul. 
[01:53:00]  No problem, guys.  Have a good day.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  Bye.  Anthony is, let me just explain.  Anthony's got, what unit do we have?  The Helix.  The Helix.  Wow.  Yeah, Paul.  That was great.  Yeah.  Oh, is he gone?  Yeah, better pictures.  Yeah, we have that outside Letterman Studio.  Yeah, Opie.  Oh, bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Anthony, you're reacting. 
[01:53:30]  The Helix, Opie.  No, you asshole.  Yeah.  Anthony has the Helix on, so he's listening to our show, which is on a slight delay, maybe  like three or four seconds, five seconds.  That's really annoying.  What are we talking about now on the Helix?  I'm repeating myself now, again, to myself.  I'm trying to hear the sound.  It sounds fine.  What sounds fine? 
[01:54:00]  What sounds fine?  I'm hearing you now.  You sound fine.  Right.  All right.  Well, this is what I do, then.  I'm going to listen on the MiFi.  Wait, why am I the only one talking live?  I don't have the chops to do this.  I hear the sound.  It sounds good.  Does it sound fine?  Yeah.  It sounds all right.  See, and I even just said it sounds fine.  Oh, wait.  Check.  Just see if it's kind of like...  Where's Jimmy Norton?  I'm right.  I was trying to get myself...  I already said it sounds fine. 
[01:54:30]  I just said it again.  Yeah, but now how is this audio?  Does it sound fine?  And I already said that I'm listening on the MiFi.  Just don't let me cut it in out.  Jimmy sounds fine.  I don't want to cut it in out.  Jimmy, don't talk live unless you have one of these units.  Well, why would I get one of those units?  Because we're listening to the show now in a delay.  They don't send me shit.  Wow, this is getting confusing.  I'm not, but it sounds fine.  We know it sounds fine.  How does it sound?  How does that fancy new unit sound?  That looks good.  Wait, dude.  Wait. 
[01:55:00]  How many times do you have to say that I'm listening on the MiFi?  Are you on the MiFi?  That's nice.  I'm hearing perfect quality.  Why my screaming sounds fine again.  This is really confusing.  Yeah.  Try watching it with no...  I think we're going back to the future, everyone.  That's wonderful.  All right, enough of that.  I like it.  That's a lovely one.  I like that show.  I'm going to give it a listen.  When we're done with this one.  Yeah, really. 
[01:55:30]  I bet it sounds at least just as good.  All right.  Can you tell we're getting close to vacation?  Wow.  We're losing our minds.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  You know, we've been on the radio for over two hours this morning, and we haven't even acknowledged  that Jimmy Norton went to the rock and roll induction ceremonies.  After all the whining and crying and bitching and kvetching.  Yes.  Oh, sorry, Jim.  No, you're right.  After all of that, you actually got in. 
[01:56:00]  Yesterday, we had Bill Ward call in, and then a lot of people didn't know, but Tony Iommi  was pitching a show.  He wants to do a show on XM.  He has a radio show in England.  So, Ben and Steve, through Kevin at Sanctuary, I fucking love these guys, hooked up a lunch.  A lunch?  For us with Tony Iommi.  You had lunch with Tony Iommi.  I'm thinking there's no way it's going to happen.  Uh-huh.  As soon as Bill called in, right after that, they got the confirmation. 
[01:56:30]  I guess the call went well.  We go across the street to Shelly's at noon.  I'm like, I figure he's going to show up at 1230.  We'll have coffee if he shows.  Yeah.  Fucking one minute of noon, there with the glasses, looking like a rock star, is Iommi  and his manager and Kevin, and fucking Tony Iommi walks in, and we're all sitting down  to have lunch.  And I'm so stupid, I was going to sit catty corner across the table, and Steve's like,  do you want to sit next to him?  And I'm like, oh yeah, thanks.  Like it's a bitch walking in.  Like a girl is coming in, and you guys are like, do you want to sit next to him? 
[01:57:00]  Dude, we sat there and fucking chit-chatted and ordered lunch and ate for an hour.  Four and forty-five minutes, I sat there and rapped with Tony Iommi.  It was fucking-  You spent an hour forty-five just hanging.  Hanging.  One of the guys.  Talking about radio and the FCC and the whole thing and censorship and play.  It was fucking amazing.  No.  No, it was fun.  This was probably one of the best days of your life. 
[01:57:30]  It might be.  I think I had the best day of my adult life yesterday.  I really did.  Yeah.  I think I had the best day of my adult life.  Ben describes a scene that only Ben can describe.  Yeah, let's get Ben in here.  And Steve in here.  Yeah.  Because they describe it slightly different.  No.  I love Ben, because Ben was very giddy and excited for you.  I was very excited for you.  But Ben, it went well for Jim.  I mean, Jim was ecstatic. 
[01:58:00]  Jim was actually a lot better behaved than I thought he would be.  I mean, he was very excited.  Yeah.  But out of the whole thing, and there's a lot of funny parts to this, the best is Steve  and I are having a conversation with Kevin from Sanctuary about other stuff, and I look  over, and Jim is pouring a pot of tea into Tony's, or coffee, into Tony's coffee cup.  Tony!  Coffee!  Tony!  Are you doing it like it's just such a...  Tony, a refresh?  Here's what happened.  Tony and I were chatting.  You know how it is when you talk to the front man from Sabbath and the guitarist, you tell him 
[01:58:30]  would you like some more coffee?  And he said, right.  He's a British gentleman.  And you've got the pot and...  I poured my friend Tony a little coffee.  As you're doing it, you're thinking to yourself, oh my God, I'm pouring coffee for Tony Iommi.  I'm saying to myself, you dumb motherfucker, don't scald Tony Iommi.  You better not spill it or it'll end up like that Canadian PSA.  The guy...  He spilled my coffee.  You fucking cunt.  Dude, I was pouring Iommi coffee. 
[01:59:00]  It was important to most people in the world.  But to you, you were the happiest little schoolgirl.  Well, even better is you just hear Jim mentioning something like, and I have this tape from 1970-something  of Bob Marley and there's a Bob Marley reference that Ozzy made and this, and Tony's describing  it like it was yesterday.  Like, he has a memory of his whole career.  It's pretty unbelievable.  You're bringing up some real obscure stuff.  But he loved it because it was like they were real fans.  It wasn't like an interview.  No, he didn't.  No, he did actually because he...  No, because Anthony and I... 
[01:59:30]  No, he didn't.  No, because Anthony and I were talking about this behind your back.  Could you imagine sitting for almost two hours with an Uber fan and all he's doing is,  dude, dude, when you did the 55-gallon jump challenge and that chick got that thing in  her ear, the bug, and the hospital, I would sit there five minutes in and someone would  be getting shot.  Either me, I might have to just shoot myself, or the fan, but to sit with an Uber fan like  that would drive me batty.  No, because we were having a nice chat.  It wasn't all that, but I think he liked the fact that somebody knows all this obscure band 
[02:00:00]  stuff instead of the same dumb shit he gets to everybody.  Perhaps he enjoyed it in the mid-70s.  Oh, he loved it.  I think it got to the point now where he's like, oh, who is this fucking wanker?  Dude, he never would have stayed for an hour and 45 minutes if he wasn't having...  The only way that we left, we were having a great time, as the manager wanted him to  relax a little before the ceremony.  We sat there.  After lunch, how long did we sit there?  Jimmy, they're telling me you have to go.  No? 
[02:00:30]  I'm teasing, of course, because I am so happy for little Jimmy.  We sat there after we ate.  We sat there.  And look, dude, I'm fairly perceptive.  If I'm annoying someone, I can see the watch look.  We were talking, because we were talking a lot about radio and music.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  It would be kind of like that.  The uncomfortable, like look down, like, all right, I'll just shut my face.  I got one question.  Certainly.  Did you guys exchange numbers?  Oh.  No.  I didn't have my Palm Pilot.  He didn't enjoy it.  He did.  He did not.  Aw, you could have hung.  If you did an hour and 45 and it was going well, the next step would be, hey, uh, how'd 
[02:01:00]  you leave it off?  Like, did you touch his arm and ask for a photo?  Well, Kevin had a camera.  I had one, and Tony was very happy to take a photo.  It was fine on the way out.  So you got one with just Tony also?  On the way out, yeah, real quick.  Because the one photo I saw, probably the greatest of the Jim Norton collection.  It absolutely is.  And this is where this whole thing leads up to.  Yep.  It was a great hang.  It was fucking, it was, he was the nicest guy. 
[02:01:30]  We were talking about everything.  I would love to do it.  Wait, let me get into this a little bit.  So Ben, was he, uh, calm?  Jim?  Yeah, during the last...  Uh, very much so.  Well, we actually talked a little bit of business, believe it or not, in the beginning.  And, you know, for, we listened to some of his radio shows.  He's actually got a pretty good radio show.  And Jim was very calm.  I was, I figured...  By business, Ben, means a Coke deal went down.  Jim was, Jim was, Jim was a lot more calm than I thought he'd be.  I thought he was going to be a pain.  Yes.  And, and we get over there, and we're like, we're going to have to wait a half an hour. 
[02:02:00]  I, I thought so, too.  I'm like, there's no fucking way.  Because Jim's like, we've got to get over there by 12.  Because he was in psycho mode before.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  So he's like, we've got to get over there.  We've got to get...  I'm serious.  There's no fucking way Tony Iommi's going to be on time.  I'm like, this is ridiculous.  So we get there.  Sure enough, he gets there a minute after us.  Wow, good thing.  Yeah.  Imagine if he showed up and you guys weren't there.  Oh.  What the fuck?  I'll go out with my wife for this shit.  Yeah, that would never happen.  Chris from, uh, Pennsylvania.  Chris?  Hey, was Jimmy sitting there like Chris Farley interviewing Paul McCartney on SNL? 
[02:02:30]  Um...  He was actually incredibly restrained.  This was not the first...  Since we interviewed Tony at Ozzfest, Jim had gotten a lot of the gushing out at Ozzfest.  And now was sort of the follow-up gushing, which was followed by Intelligent Conversation.  Jim was a lot more restrained in this conversation.  It was so...  It was so surreal.  This was so much, I couldn't be nervous.  It was like...  It was beyond...  I would be more nervous...  I was more nervous when Mila Jovovich was sitting here because I just didn't know what 
[02:03:00]  to say to her.  She's as cute as a button.  I'll say she is.  But with Iommi, it was so over the top, a dream come true.  I couldn't believe it was happening.  I was going to sit there and he's fucking ordering a Cobb salad.  A Cobb salad?  Tony wanted a Cobb salad.  With calamari.  I didn't notice that part.  It looked very good.  I'm sitting there having lunch with Iommi.  At any point did he get up to go to the bathroom?  No.  No.  Nope.  Sat there the whole time.  Neither did I.  No.  The whole time.  But the best part... 
[02:03:30]  The little bird bladder just full bursting at the seams, not wanting to miss a moment  though.  Full socks like water balloons.  My favorite part of the whole thing was the waitress comes over at the end and is like,  the cook is a huge fan.  Tony can't sign an autograph.  So he's signing an autograph.  So then we're getting up and there's these three guys that were sitting behind us.  I kind of noticed them.  They kept looking over.  You know how annoying it is.  So they grab me as I walk away.  They're like, hey, who is that guy over there?  And I start saying, he goes, no, the short guy with the bald hair, the comedian from HBO.  I'm like, well...  So how funny is that for Jim?  And then of course we walk out on the street and then Tony just gets mobbed. 
[02:04:00]  You outshone Tony Iommi.  Well, not until we get outside.  Yeah, when we get outside.  Did he really get mobbed?  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  How do people know he was there?  I just...  They recognize him.  He looks like a rock star.  When Iommi walk...  He has a black leather jacket.  Is he not recognizable?  Tony Iommi.  Yeah.  Especially...  I'm being honest.  He's dressed in all black.  His hair is all poofy.  The dyed blue black.  But people are running up going, oh my God, they knew exactly who he was.  Yes.  They just know him.  He looks like a rock star.  But even if you didn't wear a Sabbath fit, you would look at him and go, that's...  He's somebody.  You have to. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Well, they were talking about it on the walkover from the Waldorf that a cop pulls up and right  over the loudspeaker, right as he's walking on 57th, Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath, over the thing.  And they're just like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  So, it was an amazing fucking lunch.  And it wasn't...  It didn't drag.  It wasn't awkward.  We were having quite a nice chat.  We really had a few laughs.  We talked about comedy.  He was asking comedy.  What is the most obscure thing you're talking about?  Not Sabbath-wise, just something that you would never think you'd be discussing with Tony Iommi.  To be honest with you, well, like... 
[02:05:00]  The rocks in your apartment hallway?  I didn't mention that, no.  Oh, right.  That would have been one of those things, though.  I like...  I can't believe I'm talking about my rocks.  Well, I talked about how good it was to...  Because he was talking about doing these weird gigs with this comedian he knows.  That he didn't even want money for.  Like, it's a comedian friend of his.  They do parties together.  But he didn't want money because then you just pressure the performance.  Like, just kind of fun to fuck off.  So, I was talking about going on at the Cellar and just being creative and staying creative.  We had a nice artistic chat about staying creative.  Most obscure thing was I talked about Bill Ward's dreadlocks in the 70s. 
[02:05:30]  And he explained to me how that happened.  And it was a good story.  I enjoyed it.  Most obscure, though, was that Black Sabbath played with the Commodores.  Oh, yeah.  They did a show with the Commodores.  Did a shutter take.  Wow.  Tony, at some point, he had to remember all of the opening acts they ever had.  He said there was over 160 bands have opened for them over the years.  And the Commodores was the most obscure one.  So, we had our lunch.  And it was fantastic.  And I was a gushing child.  I mean, that dumb Eric from Whack Bag yesterday.  Be grateful for what...  Okay.  There was nothing more I could ask for. 
[02:06:00]  Bill called in for 20 minutes.  It was wonderful to talk to Bill.  And I sat with Tony.  And then you called everybody.  You called me.  Of course I did.  He walked up 57th Street, me, him, and Steve.  And Jim was, like, walking on air.  You were just like, this is the greatest thing.  The greatest...  And then he was getting prepared because we were still working on the whole nighttime festivities.  So, now that stress comes out of working up.  Well, Ben.  Ben's a genius.  Ben says, get a tux.  It's like 30 bucks.  This is what he tells me.  I didn't know it was going to be as much as it was.  That's all right. 
[02:06:30]  Me neither.  But I thank God for credit cards.  So, I go around the corner.  And I say, I need a tux.  And they can see how desperate I am.  When do you need it for?  Three minutes ago.  And they fit me.  And they give me the smashing price of $200.  A tux for one day.  Well, now you have it in your closet for the next time.  Oh, to rent.  Yeah, I...  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  That tux is going back.  It's fucking...  You should have done the show today with the tux on.  I thought of it.  Oh, wow.  I thought of it.  There it is.  There it is.  I thought of it.  I rent my tux for $200. 
[02:07:00]  I bring it back to my apartment.  I'm probably not going to need it.  Here's who I have working on this.  My agent, who I guess it handles Blondie and Metallica.  Steve Wigg, who is a buddy of mine, who is...  Steve is Lars' assistant.  I didn't mention that yesterday.  He's Lars' personal assistant.  He's a friend of mine.  I called him.  It turns out he goes,  Metallica just didn't have tickets because it wasn't their event.  But he worked on it.  He tried with the tour manager.  Pete Popolardo at AGI.  Fucking tried with Blondie's tour manager.  I mean, there was so much shit happening. 
[02:07:30]  My agency only had two tickets to the event.  She was $25 a ticket.  Everybody...  Tracy from XM, if you guys remember her, she knew people there doing audio.  She was working on it for me.  Fucking Ben throws out, hey, maybe Earl will get you a press pass.  I'm thinking, no, he won't.  Earl was the last option.  You really don't know Earl.  I know.  I mean, we beat him up a lot, but that guy gets things done.  Earl's amazing.  It ain't 100%.  It ain't guaranteed.  And he tells you.  He goes, look, this isn't a guarantee, but I'll try my best.  And more times than not, he comes through. 
[02:08:00]  He has more connections than anyone in this room.  The guy's been in.  I don't know how, but...  Because through Scotso's show.  That guy has met and networked with every major rock star that has been in the business.  It's amazing.  If you remember, when we had Chris Robinson, when we were up at BCN,  we were broadcasting from BCN one time, Chris Robinson.  Oh, hey, Earl.  How are you there, Earl?  It's been great to see you.  How are you doing?  How's your family?  Who the fuck knows Chris Robinson?  Yeah, that's Earl for you, though.  That's Earl.  Fucking, I'm online.  I'm almost like ready to give up because I'm tired. 
[02:08:30]  I'm like, I want to kind of jack off.  And I'm like, I did.  I got like an hour of sleep the night before.  And I'm like, don't be Gary Greedy.  You got, you hung with Iommi.  That's better than a photo.  Oh, Tony Iommi.  Oh, I'm pouring his coffee.  Maybe it would have been like that.  A little cream in that, Tony.  Really fast.  Farmer Kevin wants in.  Farmer Kevin, what's up?  Hey, I'd like to know how many times the word phenomenal was pewed out of Jimmy's mouth.  Dude, I was calmer and more professional than you would think. 
[02:09:00]  I really did want to see it help him get his show because I do think the audio was great that I heard.  I just handled it.  For some reason, I was so overwhelmed that it became a handleable, enjoyable situation.  Now, with the tux, did you wear the formal Breathe Right strip?  I didn't wear the Breathe Right strip.  Oh, I thought you wore the formal.  It looked like a little cummerbund on his nose.  Yeah, I spray painted it.  I put a little tie.  Yeah, a little Bo Breathe Right.  So I'm hanging out on my computer.  I'm kind of like fucking on pal talk, like horny. 
[02:09:30]  And I'm like, I'm just going to just relax.  But I napped for an hour.  I couldn't sleep.  It was all I kept waking up thinking of Sabbath.  I was obsessed.  Was?  Yeah.  All right.  So I finally get a call from Earl, and he goes, yeah, I may be able to, but you guys, me and Ben got turned down for our press passes.  Earl and Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez got approved.  Turns out Ron's not going, so Earl goes, why don't you come over with me?  I'll change it over from him to you.  I'm like, that's not going to work, stupid.  They're not going to just go, oh, you want to come instead of the other guy?  Walk right in.  So I'm like, why don't you call me from there? 
[02:10:00]  That's a bust.  Fucking Earl calls me a little while later.  Okay, I did it.  I'm like, I can go over there now?  He goes, yeah, but you've got to be there before 6.  So I throw my tux on.  I tried to shave my electric shaver.  I cut my lip.  I was trying to shave my little mustache.  All shaky and nervous.  Dude, I fucking cut my lip.  I'm bleeding into my mouth.  I hop into a cab in my tux.  I fucking make it over there, and I will be damned.  I walk into the press room, and she's like, um, I don't know.  We have Ron Bennington.  And I'm like, oh, Earl. 
[02:10:30]  See, Earl.  Oh, you must have just been livid.  And then she goes, oh, here you are, Jim Norton.  And the next thing you know, I have a beautiful Black Sabbath brochure, and my fucking...  Look at your warrant today.  My press pass.  Got your press pass, and you got in, and now what did the pass get you?  This is 6 o'clock.  6.20.  Into the press room, which was better than I thought.  It was a big room in the Waldorf with food and drinks.  There's a shitload of press around the room.  Uh, free food gentlemen.  It was... 
[02:11:00]  Always gets a laugh from the controller.  It was...  It was...  There was just all kinds of food and drinks and martial art instructors and all kinds of  crazy.  Um, and I...  And, like, it was like a little...  A stage for them with the big Rock and Roll Hall of Fame banner behind it.  And a few people recognized me as a comic, so I was talking to them.  There was one guy from XM.  I do not remember his name, um, but he's on one of the XM channels, like, and he has  a syndicated show from London or some shit like that, so we talked, and, um, you know, 
[02:11:30]  another guy who recognized me, like, he knew you guys from, uh, the old days, loved you.  So, nothing is happening.  This is 6, a little after 6.  The fucking show, finally, instead of 8 o'clock, starts at quarter to 9.  I'm sitting in the second row, from where I am to Ope, is how far I was from the stage  where they were going to be talking.  Ooh.  The ceremony is a crushingly boring, awful event.  We're watching it on flat screens, uh, away from the ballroom.  It's horribly boring.  Eventually, they begin to filter in the artists. 
[02:12:00]  They filter in, uh, whoever the fuck they filter in.  The two guys that started A&M, Miles Davis' family.  Um, and eventually, uh, Blondie comes in, and this is probably at 10.30.  She finally comes in, so everyone's snapping pictures.  I'm in the second row.  There's no photos in the row I'm in.  And I'm like, when Sabbath comes out, I'm gonna fucking stand up and ask a question,  and you gotta get a picture of me talking to Black Sabbath.  You have to.  I got the XM guy, whose name I can't remember.  I got the fucking other dude.  The 10-camera shoot gonna go off. 
[02:12:30]  I got the other dude who's fucking like you guys.  You know how Jimmy sets pictures up.  Oh, yeah.  And this is the ultimate shot.  I'm like, you gotta get a shot at me.  He's like, well, I'll get the back of your head.  I'm like, dude, get me a profile.  I almost moved to the other side of the room.  It was fucking really lunacy.  Jimmy's in front of a green screen.  They're like gonna superimpose it in later.  Dude, the way the artists would stand there, and people in my row in the front row had to  stay seated, and all these photographers are going, oh, to the center of the room.  Oh, to the left.  Oh, look right.  Swanny, look right.  It's fucking madness. 
[02:13:00]  The feeding finds these fucking photographers go through.  It was lunacy.  So, you know, they asked Debbie Harry some questions, and actually the guy in our band was pretty  funny.  And then afterwards, I was watching on the monitor, and fucking watching Sabbath be inducted  by Metallica.  And I got a little choked up watching Lars talk about fucking Sabbath.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  It really was a blubbering nothing.  Wow.  But it was really a movie.  Do we have audio of Metallica talking about Black Sabbath, or no?  Probably not yet.  Not yet.  I don't think.  All right, maybe tomorrow or something.  It was moving, though. 
[02:13:30]  Lars said it was so genuine and sincere about how, you know, you can't really describe what  they mean to you, but they just mean a lot.  It was just great.  So, it was like a good fucking rant he went on.  So, then they start to play, and then Sabbath goes up and gets their thing.  And I'm watching, and I think Debbie Harry is talking through this.  I'm like, fucking shut up.  I'm trying to watch and listen.  But they turn the monitors down when the press room activity is happening.  What was the thought when they walked onto the stage?  On the monitor, it was fucking, it was just wonderful to see them up there being a standing 
[02:14:00]  ovation.  They showed a huge montage of them beforehand.  They really gave Sabbath a lot of respect yesterday, which made me very happy.  And then do they each individually give like a little speech at the podium?  Well, I'll talk a little.  I couldn't hear any of it because, again, they turned that down for the artist in the room  so the press can talk to her.  There's some Tony Iommi audio here.  And I want to thank little Jimmy Norton for pouring my coffee this afternoon at our incredibly  entertaining lunch.  We do have the audio.  Metallica talking about Black Sabbath, for real. 
[02:14:30]  Do you really?  Yeah, Derek's got it.  It was an honor and a dream come true to play those songs in front of those guys.  I mean, forget about the rest of the room with all the great people in the room, but  just having those four guys there watching us play their timeless music that, like I  said, is pretty much responsible for us being here.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  There's actually a lot of it.  He talked about taking the piss.  He said, like, I remember the tour when I first saw Metallica with Ozzy and he said  that they would go up and jam Ozzy songs or Sabbath songs and Ozzy's like, are they 
[02:15:00]  taking the piss?  Like, he thought they were fucking with him.  Right.  He didn't know if they were, like, just goofing on Sabbath stuff because Ozzy didn't think  anybody liked them.  So anyway, a little while later they said we got Metallica coming in.  So I'm second row.  I'm like, fucking, this is fantastic.  Metallica is fucking three feet in front of me.  Right there.  Right there.  People are barking out questions, and Lars is very vocal and comfortable, and I bark  out a couple of questions.  What did you ask?  Do we have audio of this?  Yeah, the guy who was doing XM, who recorded for XM. 
[02:15:30]  Are we going to get this?  Yeah, we're going to get this.  Oh, my God.  But you were, like, an official press guy.  You were actually asking questions?  How many questions did you ask?  Well, for Metallica, well, we'll get to that, because Metallica, I think the question  I ask is, why do you think the critics are always, because these fucking reporters,  what are you guys on tour?  Who gives a shit?  Stupid.  So I'm like, why do you think the critics, what is it about Black Sabbath that caused  the critics to shun them the way they did?  It was, like, in that vibe of a question. 
[02:16:00]  And they were like, um, and then Kirk kind of just said, because their name wasn't White  Sabbath, which got kind of a laugh.  You know, there wasn't, I guess, they didn't really expect that kind of a question.  And I think I asked one more question of them, which, uh, because I kept going, hey, guys,  you are, I was the fucking, the worst.  Oh, no.  And Headfield addressed the second question I asked, uh, pretty thoroughly.  And for real, he looked at me, it was really weird, he was looking at me when he talked,  I think they could sense that I was a fan, and not just a jack-off sort of education.  So does Jimmy piss himself, like he's answering his question, you just hear the trickle of 
[02:16:30]  yellow water down his pants, and see a big wet spot in the front.  And I look over, and I see my friend Steve, who's Lars' assistant, so Metallica, I got  a great shot of Metallica on stage, too, fucking walk backstage, and I walk over there, and  I see Steve, and we say hello, and I'm like, can I come back?  I was going to come back, like, there's a black curtain, like, here's the stage in  front of you, and then there's a black curtain behind that, where they bring the artists  in for the other room, but behind the black curtain, away from the press, was Entertainment  Tonight, Access Hollywood, and one more, where they did these, like, group TV things, 
[02:17:00]  which we didn't have access to.  You have to walk behind a curtain and have special credentials.  So I say to Steve, can I come back to him?  He goes, let me see where Lars' head is at, because he has to take care of Lars.  I don't hear anything, I'm like, fuck it, I'm not going to bug Steve, he's running around.  I go back and sit down.  By now, Earl has come.  Earl comes at 10 o'clock.  I've been there since a little after 6.  He bumbles in, and I'm fucking like, alright, Earl, I love you for getting me in.  When I'm asking a Sabbath question, he's got a fucking, a regular camera with film. 
[02:17:30]  He doesn't even have a digital.  Right.  I'm like, you gotta snap a photo of me talking to Sabbath.  And he's like, okay.  And he's going to stand right next to me.  I'm like, dude, you gotta move a little bit.  You can't fucking stand right here.  So he goes way in the-  He was going to take an artistic shot of, like, your ear in black and white.  And that'll be like, your ear represents you listening to back to the-  No, get the fucking picture, artist.  So I look around.  I'm hoping Sabbath is coming.  I see Earl in the back of the room, like Ben said, talking to fucking two people who no one should talk to. 
[02:18:00]  Some fat guy with long hair and, like, a fucking Matrix long jacket.  It's like, why would you address this person, Earl?  So I interrupt him.  I tap him.  That's probably meatloaf.  You idiot.  That's exactly who it was.  It looked exactly like him.  Just a big fatso.  Nobody cares.  Or Bubba, you know, like, before he got cut.  So I fucking go to Earl.  I'm like, I just tap him.  I'm like, look, can you make sure we get set up?  Because Sabbath's coming in soon.  And he's like, okay.  And he shows the reason I'm going to stand right here.  I'm like, you're going to get the back of my fucking head if you stand here.  It was almost like it was a direct shot from the back of my head to the podium.  I'm like, go over there.  So I move him to the left. 
[02:18:30]  And he's ready with the camera.  So fucking the next thing they say, ladies and gentlemen, Black Sabbath.  Fucking Ozzy comes on.  Geezer comes on.  It's a little awkward because the other guys aren't there yet.  And I'm just, of course, I'm standing there and bursting with energy.  And I want to fucking talk to them.  A minute later, the whole fucking band is on stage.  Some fucking reporter fires out some stupid fucking question.  Who knows what it was.  Hey, guys, can you guys shut up?  I fucking hijacked that fucking press conference.  Oh, man.  I fucking hijacked it. 
[02:19:00]  We need this audio.  Oh, I gotta hear this.  When do we get this audio?  I gotta hear this.  I fucking blurted out the real questions that I wanted to ask.  And I testimonialed before every question.  It was like I was, you know, these guys, I wanted to say shit in front of the media.  Hey, do you guys think because the mainstream critics ignored you, then questioned.  You know, I asked like four or five questions.  People were fucking disgusted.  By the way, I've been back there.  I went a couple years ago.  You're only supposed to get one question.  They must have hated you because they do it very systematically. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, they hated my guts.  Because not only did I fucking blur the question out, but I stood up for my picture.  So I'm talking to Sabbath.  And all I hear is, could you sit down, sir?  Could you sit down?  Could you sit down, sir?  I'm thinking, take the picture, you fucking black bastard.  I am fucking standing there.  And when they walked out, Tony looked out and recognized me.  Tony smiled when he saw me because I guess it was a familiar like face.  He goes, oh.  And then fucking, I think Bill recognized me.  And Ozzy, of course, didn't.  But Geezer like remembered my face. 
[02:20:00]  Like I was making eye contact with all of them.  And as they're talking, I'm giving them a fist like, yes.  I'm congratulating them.  I was so fucking happy.  Thumbs upping like a little douche that I was.  Did you give a bow type wave like I gave you from the...  But I would have.  I would have.  I would have given a rapey, a faggoty bow if I thought it would have made the fucking  four British gentlemen happy.  Yes.  I was testimony before every fucking question.  I have got to hear his question.  It wasn't that long, but it was...  Don't care.  I would hear somebody try to say something. 
[02:20:30]  Radio gold.  And I would go up, hey guys, do you think that's the main reason?  And I would hear someone trying to talk, fuck you, you're out of your league.  This is 30 years, motherfucker.  Right.  Sit down, time boy.  This is all built up in Jimmy.  Sit down, David Hinckley.  Ask your douchey.  So guys, when are you going on tour?  Another one asked them.  Yeah.  When's the new album coming out, you fucking hack?  What album was a hole in the sky on?  Next question.  Shit dick.  Wow.  People are calling you a stalker on Pal Talk.  No.  Fuck Pal Talk.  I'm not a stalker. 
[02:21:00]  You don't think?  No.  I was asking questions.  I wasn't dragging you up behind them.  I wish there were pictures of you looking at Black Sabbath because I bet you it's that creepy  stare you get.  Oh, I've got to see any picture and hear any audio.  I know what Jim's talking about because I've been in the room a couple years ago.  It's all these journalist types.  There's not a lot of real fans.  And I mean, the year we were back there, Aerosmith was getting in and Michael Jackson was where  you are, Opie is to me.  And it's just like, but there's nobody, it's all press people.  And they asked the dumbest questions.  It's, you know, when's the new album coming out? 
[02:21:30]  You know, what's the tour dates?  You know, when are you touring Europe?  So there's no fans back there.  So they appreciate a question like, because I congratulated them.  Of course, nobody in the press congratulated them.  And I was, it was, I think people could sense that I was going to jump in and ask questions  that I wanted to ask.  And after a while, they just stopped trying.  And one guy asked a couple of decent questions, but they were addressing me.  Fucking Ozzy is talking and he started telling the story that Lars told.  So I said, how does it feel?  And I heard when I said, hey, how does it feel?  And I heard someone go, ah, somebody fucking groaned. 
[02:22:00]  Somebody groaned.  Because I was like, how does it feel that even though you were ignored, that it was your  peers that lifted you up and kind of forced them to recognize you, forced this Rock and  Roll Hall of Fame to recognize you, which it really was.  It's all the bands talking about them and giving them props for all these years that  they could not be ignored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  And, you know, and they would talk about how they felt about that.  Oh.  Oh.  They were, sir, could you sit down?  Could you sit down, sir?  Sir, we can't see.  And all you could see, if a middle finger could have jumped out of the back of my head 
[02:22:30]  and went, fuck you, it's picture time.  Dude, I was, I've never, this was the greatest night of my fucking life.  You could hear it in his voice.  Yeah.  So they walk off, I congratulate them, I was addressed by all of them.  It was, it was, dude, I could not have asked for a better night.  They walk back behind the curtain, of course I walk back, I see Ozzy's assistant, the guy  who brought him in, Tony Dennis, and I walk behind and I go, Tony Dennis, and he kind  of looks like he recognized me.  So I walk behind the black curtain, and Earl doesn't want to buck the system. 
[02:23:00]  I'm like, come here, Earl, get behind the fucking curtain.  He's like, oh, wait, just come on behind the fucking curtain.  You're black, they'll be afraid of being called racist by throwing you out.  Get over here.  He'll blend right into that curtain.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's not even a joke.  He dresses completely black from head to toe.  Someone left their false teeth in the curtain.  Oh, it's talking.  So fucking, I'm standing back there, I got my camera out, and there's this bald guy with  a fucking tattoo on his head.  I know he's with Sabbath, but I don't know his name.  I'm like, fuck, this guy's going to be a problem.  I don't see Ralph, who's Tony's guy. 
[02:23:30]  Because they're behind another area doing like Entertainment Tonight or Access Hollywood.  And the guy goes, boy, last time I saw you, it was 100 degrees out.  I'm like, fuck, he was in Sabbath Village when I interviewed the guys.  He knew me.  So I'm like, yeah.  Oh, that was Walter, I think.  It might have been Bill's guy.  You must have then just went, oh, whew.  So I'm like, yeah, man.  I'm like, we had Tony.  I talked to Tony for like an hour and a half today about an XM show, and Bill called in.  He goes, yeah, no, I know.  And we were chatting.  I'm like, this is fucking great.  So I'm like, I want to get a picture with the band.  He's like, well, just try to hang here. 
[02:24:00]  And when they come off, I'll see if I can, you know, I'll see if I can do it.  And then Tony Dennis and I was Ozzy's personal assistant.  So I'm talking about XM and satellite radio.  Because these guys all love fucking satellite.  They love the idea of it.  So I was having a nice chat.  15 minutes later, some woman walks over and goes, can I help you?  I'm like, yeah.  I was just talking to Tony Dennis.  I had Tony on.  She's like, oh, okay, okay.  Like, I belong there.  Yeah, she's good.  I didn't belong there, fat lady.  You should have thrown me out.  Fuck it.  I'm fucking telling her on now.  Look, dude, this is how you turn the camera on.  I'm like, I know he's going to blow it. 
[02:24:30]  Fucking the band finally comes out.  I turn the camera on.  Fucking Ozzy walks over.  And I'm like, I actually wanted to get a quick picture with the band.  And he's like, all right.  So I stand there.  I got my arm around Ozzy.  The fucking band isn't coming.  Oh, no.  Now you're standing there all awkwardly.  And he goes, all right, man.  Just take the picture.  Because I got to go.  I'm like, fuck.  I'm like, geezer.  I'm like fucking panicking.  I got my arm around Ozzy.  I can only imagine the panic because he has it in his head that he's getting a picture 
[02:25:00]  with the band.  Yeah, because he already has the Ozzy picture.  Earl fucking snaps the picture because Bill Ward is signing something.  Tony is signing something.  Ozzy walks away.  I, honest to God, I went, oh, no.  I fucking wailed like a woman.  I went, dude, I went, no.  I made.  It's all crumbling apart in front of him this perfect day.  It was pure, honest emotion devoid of all dignity or self-consciousness. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, no.  And I said to the fucking guy, oh, I want a picture of Sabbath.  Where's Ozzy?  And I fucking, I was in tears because Ozzy goes, get a picture with those guys.  And then he walked away.  So I fucking couldn't get the Sabbath picture.  Fucking Tony comes over and goes, hey, man.  He was really happy to see me.  I go, oh, dude, I want to get a picture with the band, but Ozzy won't stop.  And he fucking walks with me.  And we walk out into this other little staging area.  And he grabs Ozzy.  He goes, hold on for a second. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  Fucking I only stopped Ozzy for me.  I'm going to get, I got fucking Earl at the camera.  I'm like, I got Geezer there.  I got Tony.  I'm in the middle.  Fucking Tony's on my left.  Ozzy's on his left.  Geezer's on my right.  And fucking Bill's not there.  Bill's signing something.  And I'm like, Bill.  Bill walks in.  He's like, my fucking uncle.  I'm calling him.  I'm like, Bill, get over here.  He runs.  Bill Ward runs.  And as he's running, he's probably like, who the fuck is this nobody?  Why am I running for this guy?  Calling me over for a photo.  Because it was an instinct when someone calls you over and there's a camera, you're running.  And then he probably looked and he goes, why am I running? 
[02:26:30]  This is a fucking nobody.  This is not a celebrity.  And the next thing you know, Bill Ward is on the right.  There's the picture.  All set up.  I see the fucking orange light light up.  I'm like, please, God.  Please, God.  Flash, flash, flash.  The fucking camera flashed.  I got my fucking picture.  It's perfect.  It's the fucking best celebrity photo I have.  It is one of the best pictures that I could ever see Jimmy having.  I fucking, everyone in Sabbath, I got my arm around fucking Tony and Geezer.  Fucking, everyone's looking at the camera. 
[02:27:00]  You're happy as a pig and shit.  You're smiling.  You got your tux on.  They're all holding their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame trophies.  Yeah, they all got their trophies.  You look like you're a guy in the band.  Right.  You look like you're part of Sabbath.  Actually, he looks like.  That's how natural that picture looks.  He looks like part of the Rat Pack because he's got his tux on.  His tux.  He's just hanging with the guys.  Without his bow tie.  He's got his.  Looks like you need a martini in your hand or something.  Is that a fucking.  It's really a great picture, son.  What are the odds of getting all those guys in a picture like that?  All looking the same way.  They all fucking fucking. 
[02:27:30]  They were all looking at her all.  They all had the Rock and Roll.  No glare in a window.  No bad, like, framing.  It's perfect.  Amazing.  It's the fucking best.  You could fix Red Eye with the.  Oh, the Red Eye was fixed.  I thought I said that was already sent back to be fixed.  That's easy.  And the greatest.  I mean, they got the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame awards in their hand.  And that's historic.  I mean, how can you beat that ever?  Dude, everyone in Sabbath is.  It's the fucking greatest celebrity photo I've ever gotten.  So what is that getting blown up to?  What size?  It's over, like, your fireplace.  That'll be the entire wall. 
[02:28:00]  That's the west side.  I'm covering windows with that.  Yeah.  I actually am going to get.  I wanted to have the special frame made.  A fucking cross for my Sabbath photos.  Like a big frame with my.  But I'm like, ah, man.  If I had a picture with the band, that'd be great to put it at the top of the crucifix.  Right.  And now I can't believe it happened.  That's the picture.  I fucking will always love it.  That's the picture where Jesus' head would be.  That's in Ray.  I-N-R-I.  Oh, there's where you're putting it.  I fucking love Earl.  I am taking Ben, Earl, and Steve out for a fucking steak. 
[02:28:30]  I won't pay for Ben's liquor.  But I am taking them out for a fucking steak dinner somewhere.  It is probably the greatest night of my adult life.  These guys really helped you out.  You know that.  They are responsible for it.  I want to know, though, what-  How many people did you guys have to tell that he has leukemia and he's 12?  Only a few, boy.  I want to know what-  I want to know-  I was saying to Steve this morning, like, in the cab back from the Waldorf to your apartment,  like, how many times you were looking at that picture?  Not at all.  I looked at it once and I made sure it took, and then I'm, like, keeping it to my thing. 
[02:29:00]  I'm like, please, God, don't let the picture get erased.  And I fucking just-  Just huddled my camera.  Would it be great if there was a little puff of white smoke and all you smelt was electronics burnt?  No.  Like, when you-  When something just goes, and you go, what's burning?  It smells like circuit board.  Ah!  And it's your camera.  Those guys took a picture, too.  I got a scenario for you.  So now you're going back to your apartment in a cab, right?  Yes.  Let's just say it gets T-boned.  Horrific accident.  You're completely fine.  A miracle.  You are fine, but you watch your digital camera go flying out of the cab and bounce, bounce, bounce. 
[02:29:30]  And then, like, a city bus runs it over.  Um, I'm unhappy.  And what I do is I try to contact Bill Ward's guy because he also took a picture.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, but you know, sometimes two different cameras, picture looks-  He was right behind her.  Horrid.  Well, dude, if it was the option of a city bus crush picture or picture, I'd take picture.  Do you know that we're looking at the peak of Jimmy's life right here?  Yeah, this is it.  This is it.  You know that, right?  It just-  Everyone has-  It's up, and now here it goes back there. 
[02:30:00]  Everyone's life has that peak.  Yes.  And then it just gets worse from there until you're shitting yourself in a bed somewhere  with family members around.  That was it.  That was it for me.  And I-  It'll never get better than yesterday.  Someone asked me, why didn't you get Metallica?  And I'm like, I didn't want to blow my wad and do something stupid first.  I mean, I would love to have a shot of Metallica, but that was not the goal, dude.  But you have a picture with James and Lars, don't you?  I actually have all of them.  Oh, you do?  Well, then you have it.  I have all of them as well.  Okay.  But I-  I don't know. 
[02:30:30]  I'm just talking about you.  But-  A lot of people are saying you jerked off on Pal Talk last night.  No, I did not jerk off on Pal Talk.  I was fucking so happy.  I was showing my picture, of course, because people wanted to know.  And there was a little show going on, and I changed.  I was wearing my boxers and my fucking, uh, my t-shirt, and I didn't realize that my camera  was kind of fucking low.  Like, in my camera, my thing, but I knew I was on camera, but I was, like, fucking just  kind of scratching and adjusting my bag and my mule, but I wasn't jerking off. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Well, there's a little controversy with that.  I would please.  I-  I know.  You would admit it.  I've jerked off many times looking at Pal Talk chicks, but not in the main room.  Well, the picture of Jimmy with, uh, the entire band is up on opiananthony.com.  It's a fucking- it's my favorite photo that I've ever taken.  I don't look particularly fat.  What was Earl like during this whole thing?  He was very calm, dude.  He was a little nervous we were going to get thrown out.  But every time-  I see him freaking out.  You're going to get me thrown out?  Every time somebody would look at us, I would just start acting like I belong there.  So I would just start talking to Earl about nonsense. 
[02:31:30]  Like, you know, dude, the fucking satellite thing.  Nobody wants to deal with commercials anymore.  Just keep talking until they walk away.  It looks like you belong here.  And fucking, uh, I-I-I-I fucking love Earl.  I will always- I will never have a bad thing to say about Earl.  I've been in that situation with Jimmy, and it's just not-  I have, too.  It's just not fun.  We all have.  No offense.  Metallica backstage.  I know you get the job done.  Trust me.  That was so hard, dude.  It was me and, uh, Bill Burr and Jim Norton.  And you, right, Ben?  Yeah, I was there.  It was so not fun.  We stayed for two hours after the show.  Two hours after the show just to take care of our-our pal. 
[02:32:00]  And be there for him.  It was the worst.  Those are hard photos to get.  Sabbath is a band.  I said to Tony, I'll never get this chance again.  Yeah.  Sabbath and Sabbath won't tour again.  But they're very rarely together as a band, dude.  They fly separately.  They stay in different hotels.  They fucking probably meet five minutes before they go on.  There's just not a lot of band opportunities.  And this was someplace they were doing press together, and that's rare.  Why don't we listen to Metallica playing Iron Man?  We got a little clip of that.  Yes.  They did this, what, last night or whatever?  They did this at Hole in the Sky, which I love them for doing. 
[02:32:30]  I am Iron Man.  I am Iron Man. 
[02:33:00]  I am Iron Man.  I am Iron Man.  That's Headfield?  Fucking Headfield, man.  Yeah.  Good job.  They did that.  They didn't sound like him at all.  They did that.  And fucking Hole in the Sky, which is the first song of Sabotage.  As far as Sabotage songs, it's not one of their more mainstream popular songs. 
[02:33:30]  I love Metallica for doing it.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jeff in O-Town.  Jeff.  Hey, Jimmy.  Let me tell you something.  Really, you're my hero, and I love to listen to you talk about Sabbath, and I'm not even  that big of a Sabbath fan, but I get to hear, you must have, besides not jerking off on  Paltalk, I know, you're a freak, man.  You must have done something else when you got home.  Tell me what, I want to know what happened afterwards.  Hi.  Well, the meeting is amazing, but I want to hear what happened on the way home, how you  felt, what you did when you got home, because there's something else going on.  There's something you're covering up. 
[02:34:00]  No, no.  Dude, I'll tell you what I did when I got home.  I was on Paltalk for a while.  I called a couple of friends.  It was, I mean, this was the one I wanted.  I couldn't believe it came out so perfectly.  I wound up just jacking off and going to bed.  I was running around.  I couldn't sleep.  I'm probably going on three hours of sleep in two days.  And by the way, thank God I flew home from Aspen when I did.  Remember, I came home a day early so I wouldn't miss the Iommi lunch if it happened or the  Bill Ward call in, because fucking my friend Chelsea got stuck sleeping in an airport because  fucking Aspen, that thaggity city was snowing.  If I would have gotten stuck and missed that because of snow, I would have fucking killed 
[02:34:30]  myself.  Yeah.  It would have ruined my life.  Quite literally.  So happened.  It would have ruined his life, and I believe it.  And I fucking left that dumb city.  But no, dude, I didn't do anything.  There was nothing I could do that would have topped what happened.  There was nothing I could do that would have completed my night more.  I mean, I just couldn't.  This was it for you.  I mean, what else you got to look forward to?  I mean, this is, you've done everything you've ever wanted to now in life.  It really was.  I was very fucking lucky to have that happen. 
[02:35:00]  Now I would like to do a one hour or two hour radio thing with Bill once and once with  Tony, because I really do want to do that stuff.  I mean, I really want to do that with those guys.  And they're open to it.  And they're both very open to it.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  Tim, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just had to tell you, man.  You had me so captivated with that story.  I was with you the whole time.  Is he going to get it?  Is he going to get it?  I was so on your side.  I was like, come on, get in the fucking picture.  Thanks, man.  I felt so good for you, man.  Thank you.  It was fucking great.  I was like, I got the picture almost. 
[02:35:30]  Awesome.  Yeah, it was great, man.  And I'm fucking, I can't believe it happened.  It's like, it was really weird.  Normally, everything works against you in those moments.  But when Ozzy walked away, and he wasn't being a dick, dude.  He was just tired.  He didn't want to stand there and wait for fucking three other guys and a camera crew.  He's fucking, you know, been gone since 8 in the morning.  So it was like the assistants, their energy was there.  It was like a really weird thing.  Nobody was like, all right, come on, Ozzy, let's go.  They were kind of like looking around like, fuck.  Kismet.  Exactly.  Whatever it is, that's what it was.  But you can see they kind of felt bad. 
[02:36:00]  Like, I think they kind of remember me from this, and they kind of know that I'm a very big supporter, vocal.  And they just kind of wanted to see it work out for me, like you would a retarded child.  Right.  Exactly.  That's what I was thinking.  Yeah, I understand.  Like a retarded child.  Yeah.  Tom in Wisconsin.  Jimmy.  Yes, Tom.  Man, I am so, are you there?  Yes, sir.  Hey, I am so happy for you, guys.  I mean, you know, kid in a candy store, you sound so happy.  I mean, I can feel the love.  And you know what?  It beats the shit out of cancer jokes any day to hear you this happy. 
[02:36:30]  I mean, it'd be like me, meet Betty Van Halen.  I'm so proud.  I'm glad Earl made it happen for you.  And keep up the good work.  Thank you.  May all your dreams come true.  Aw.  They have.  All right, Tom.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, how was the rest of the ceremony?  I guess it existed.  I mean, did you leave right after the picture was done?  After that was only Skynyrd.  I was back there while Skynyrd was playing.  How do they sound?  I could hear free.  Yeah.  Who knew?  I mean, I walked right out when I was done. 
[02:37:00]  I walked right out and got into a cab.  Nothing could have finished that.  Debbie Harry was hanging around.  Who cares?  You didn't see the Blondie controversy there with the Blondie?  Oh, yeah.  I did see that.  Sure.  Yeah.  The guys who were fucking dicks.  Yeah.  Well, they were in the band.  They were in Blondie.  She's not Blondie.  She's Debbie fucking Harry.  The band was Blondie, and back when they had their hits, that's the reason they're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, not for what they did recently, which she did with a couple of guys and then the cover band guys that she threw in there. 
[02:37:30]  So there are original members that were not allowed to play with her on stage.  But did the original members go up with her?  I guess they got up to get the award.  But they all hate each other now.  Yeah, they hate each other, couldn't play.  And what?  I didn't even know the story.  And Debbie Harry's playing with just a bunch of guys?  She's playing with a couple of guys that were in the band and then a couple of other guys that just weren't in the band.  And there was like a little back and forth between one of the guys in the band, the original member. 
[02:38:00]  The original members said, and I kind of caught everybody off guard, they said something about, well, you know, we were there in the beginning and we would like to have played, but we weren't asked to play.  We would love to have played.  But, you know, well, whatever, welcome to bingo night.  It was something really snotty.  Yeah.  So in the back, when Blondie and the other two guys came back, when Harry and the other two guys came back, the one guy, Chris, is pretty funny.  He was honest.  They asked what about happened.  And he goes, look, they tried to sue us.  And then he mentioned the other guy. 
[02:38:30]  He goes, I played with this guy for 20 years.  I played with them for maybe four and a half.  I mean, I know that's where the hits came from.  But he's like, you know, they shouldn't have tried to sue us.  They shouldn't have bad-mouthed us and distanced themselves.  They're basically saying, look, these assholes left and then fucked us and now want to play.  Fuck them.  It don't matter, I think.  I agree.  Even if they're assholes, they're the guys that were there for the hits.  Yeah.  Well, we have that clip there, Derek.  Let's take a listen.  One thing that could really make it better would be if we could actually perform for you tonight.  But for some reason, some of us are not allowed to do that. 
[02:39:00]  So I don't know what we could do about that, but I'd like to do that.  And I'd like to play, but Debbie, is that allowed?  No?  We'd like to play with you guys.  Me, Nigel.  Not tonight.  Pretty please.  Pretty please, Debbie.  I love you.  Can't you see my band is up there?  Oh, your band.  I thought Blondie was being inducted tonight.  Wow.  I didn't catch the good. 
[02:39:30]  I didn't catch the good.  Oh, that is great audio.  I thought Blondie was being inducted tonight, not Debbie fucking Harry.  So she's up there with these guys that are just, have nothing to do with the old days.  Yeah.  Well, a few of them anyway.  Yeah.  And who is that guy?  Was he the guitarist or something?  I'm not sure.  I mean, it's probably paying this guy.  Is there a legal fight going on?  I guess there is.  Yeah, there's all kinds of lawsuits.  Wow.  That is really uncomfortable.  Ooh.  Can we pretty please, Debbie?  Like, you fucking bitch.  Not tonight.  My band's up there.  Yeah.  Oh, your band. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, the guy's right.  He goes, I thought they were inducting Blondie.  Excuse me.  That was me.  This guy.  You.  Not the guy that's up on stage there.  Amazing.  You know, it's going to be another fun one when Guns N' Roses gets inducted.  Because now there's a whole, it's a similar thing.  Dan's commercial.  Axel Lodge show.  Yeah.  The one he didn't get every time it plays.  We blow it.  Really, really bad.  Yeah, when Guns N' Roses.  Well, because now there's a whole thing going on with Wyland and Slash.  There was like a press release put out that Slash went to Axel's house to eat up.  Yeah, but who knows what's real, but Axel's being sued by the former members. 
[02:40:30]  Because he's a man's man.  Are they going to do it in an octagon?  Yeah.  Is it going to be in an octagon to fight?  Oh, it's going to be a Braveheart fight?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm embarrassed.  I don't get that.  I don't either.  Braveheart.  Wait, it was in the paper tape.  It was on page six.  Here we go.  Rose cocked by Velvet Fist.  We told you Saturday that Axel Rose fled the Stereo nightclub in a huff after a drunken fan  inadvertently spat in his eye and irritated his contact lenses. 
[02:41:00]  Now the ex-Guns N' Roses frontman has found himself in a spat of a different kind with Velvet  Revolver frontman Scott Wyland.  Wyland attacked Rose on his group's website after Rose dissed him and Velvet Revolver guitar  Slash, who was battling Rose in court over Guns N' Roses' legacy.  You're an asshole, Axel.  Angry typing guy.  Scott Wyland doing the angry typing guy?  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  Wyland writes...  Oh, this is good.  I'll resist the urge to stoop to your level. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, shit.  Here it comes.  You fat, Botox-faced, wig-wearing fuck.  Okay, I feel better now.  Wow.  Is that what he said?  That is angry typing guy.  Yeah, there's a whole post on their website.  I was checking it out earlier.  Wyland also accuses Rose of having an unoriginal, uncreative little mind.  That's, you know, that's kind of not fair.  I mean, Axel came up with some really good shit, man.  Yeah, he was good.  And I love Scott Wyland and everything he does. 
[02:42:00]  Frightened little...  Unoriginal, uncreative little mind and calls him a frightened little man.  Meanwhile, the alarming Axel Takes Manhattan sightings continue to pile up.  A little rock and roll brawl.  In the hip-hop community, you wouldn't have heard that.  You'd have heard gunfire and silence.  That's it.  Gunfire and then no one talking about who did what.  That's the difference.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know, man. 
[02:42:30]  I didn't see anything.  I don't know.  I didn't see nothing.  There's videos, cameras, outside the place.  Oh, them tapes is missing.  Did you hear that whole fucking thing?  Like, as that story's coming together?  Who was involved in that shooting?  Buster Rhymes.  Yeah, Buster Rhymes.  Ben's friend, Buster Rhymes.  One of his bodyguards got shot.  And all of a sudden, Buster clams up.  They're, like, ready to arrest him for not cooperating.  And then, apparently, there were a bunch of cameras outside that would have caught all  the action on videotape. 
[02:43:00]  Well, the tapes mysteriously disappear.  These fucking hip-hop guys.  You know, the rock guys are just fags.  They want to kill the guy who did it, right?  Oh, yeah.  They want to, you know, down the road, you'll hear some guy died, and, you know, that'll  be retribution.  That's how they deal with it.  Yeah.  Look at how the rock guys deal with it.  The same way the assholes on message boards.  You fat wig-wearing botox.  Rock guys are pussies.  Got to pull out the gat.  Show them where it's at.  Yeah.  This is a really good question. 
[02:43:30]  We'll end with this before we take a break.  By the way, a lot of people say, one of the best stories ever, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Steve in Indianapolis.  Steve?  Yeah.  Hey, little Jimmy, I love you, but the way you're carrying on around Tony Iommi, I got  to ask this question.  If Tony would have said, buddy, drop to your knees and slob the knob, would you have?  Before he said knees, I would have been down there.  No.  My friend Tony needed help.  I'd help my friend Tony.  That's what friends do.  Help out. 
[02:44:00]  That's right.  I would have manned up and poured him some coffee.  Hey, Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Yeah, man, I got to say, man, fucking that story, I was at the edge of my seat, my steering  wheel, that one and Patrice's rape story are the best fucking stories I've heard so far  on you guys' show, man.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Had all the features, celebrity, action, intrigue.  Almost didn't get it.  Yeah, didn't know if it was going to happen, and then the happy ending.  Dude.  We should do a special weekend. 
[02:44:30]  We should do a special weekend on the channel.  Story time with Opie and Anthony.  Stories?  And pull out some of the best stories that we've told.  Stories?  I like that idea.  I like stories.  Write that down.  That's a good one.  Write it down, fan.  All right.  Thanks, Jason.  Oh, fuck.  Yep.  We're going to take a break, okay?  Right.  And we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program in just a bit.  Someone died.  Someone died.  We'll get into that next.  Yes, he finally got his whammy. 
[02:45:00]  I was going to say that.  It is a quickie so we can do it.  Horrible.  No plane crash.  No plane crash.  No plane crash.  No plane crash.  No plane crash.  No plane crash.  No plane crash.  Stop.  Oh, stop on a too short runway.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, come on.  Nice landing.  Good landing.  Good landing.  No crashes.  Good landing.  And stop on engine trouble.  Oh, no. 
[02:45:30]  Yikes.  Plane crash kills ex-TV host.  Yeah.  Santa Monica, California, a former TV game show host, and his wife were killed yesterday  when their small plane crashed into Santa Monica Bay.  Peter, excuse me.  Peter Tamarkin, is that how you say his name?  63, host of the hit 1980s game show, Press Your Luck, and his wife, Kathleen, 41, were  on their way to San Diego to ferry a patient to UCLA Medical Center, according to blah, blah, 
[02:46:00]  blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, celebrities get involved in this.  They're part of this angel thing, what's it called?  Angel Flight West.  Yeah, so celebrities that have their own planes, why not they fly patients that need to be flown  to special care units and stuff for free?  Oh.  Sounds like a very nice charitable thing to do.  Well, it's a quick drop-off in the lake.  Yeah.  Why not?  And they're looking for these...  Dehydration.  They're looking for the third person, by the way.  Ah, I wonder how that's going to work out. 
[02:46:30]  Who thought their life was pretty bad to begin with.  Good news and bad news.  Doesn't have to go through that chemo, but...  That's who you want to fucking die with, some fucking game show host behind the wheel of  a plane.  As your plane is crashing, Richard Dawson leans over.  Give me a kiss, would you love?  Kiss, love!  We're going to make the runway survey, Sid!  Come on, come on, make the runway.  I know we got engine trouble, but, you know, they can make it. 
[02:47:00]  Just glide it in, glide it in, and stop!  Oh, you came up short.  Yikes.  Um, help, air traffic control.  Um, oh, fuck, the engine's not working.  Uh, oh, no, we're losing speed.  Um, things you say when you're dying in a plane crash.  Yes.  Um...  You got it!  Anthony?  Yeah.  Tributes coming in from game shows all across the nation.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  This is what the Price is Right had to say about this tragic news today.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, and, uh, the engine making a strange sound on the way down.  Uh, yeah, Bob Barker described it as, uh, he went down like a Plinko chip.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Tributes coming in from all over the country. 
[02:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  From other game shows.  Yeah.  Take it and run with it, kids.  We'll, uh, see what you got next.  That's right.  Dude.  Ralphie Mae's checking out the Jimmy Norton photo with Black Sabbath.  Holy fuck.  It's on opianthony.com.  That is awesome.  Jimmy's been working his whole life to get that picture right there.  Are you kidding me?  I remember how stoked you were when you were a kid and you, like, won, like, something,  like, the picture in the newspaper next to the, where you got Galaga, and it had Ozzy 
[02:48:30]  Osbourne beside it on the same photo.  You were like, you kept that whole clipping.  Yep.  And, like, dude, and now this?  24 years ago.  I don't even know if the new listeners understand how huge this was for Jimmy.  I don't, I don't think they get it.  I think Jimmy told an unbelievable story.  I was really, really into it.  And I don't know if they understand.  This is it for Jimmy.  This is it.  This is all he ever wanted in his life.  Jimmy, the greatest picture I'll ever take, was taken last night.  Jimmy's going to become a huge star for HBO, and still, it won't be as big as that picture 
[02:49:00]  that you're looking at right now, Ralphie Mae.  I believe it.  It's a great picture, man.  Sabbath, man.  You have a picture with Kiss?  I have one.  My Kiss picture's not as good because, I mean, I'm glad I got it.  It was only three of the four.  Ace is not in it.  It's the guy in Ace's makeup.  But it is Gene, Peter, Paul.  I'm in front of Paul.  But there's four of the people in the picture.  Are they inducted?  No.  But when they are...  Think that'll ever happen?  Maybe.  A little too much of a goof band?  No. 
[02:49:30]  They'll definitely make it.  They'll definitely make it.  I bet you they make it next year.  Jimmy, start planning.  I bet you they make it next year.  If Blondie made it.  Have they been nominated, or...?  I do not know.  That's a good question, Ant.  Oh, thank you.  73.  Yeah, they have been around long enough.  They have had a huge effect on rock and roll.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, nobody was doing Pyro before them, man.  There would have been no Def Leppard Laser Show without the Kiss.  Let Opie know...  Is this real?  Where's Ben?  Let Opie know Imus needs to speak with him at 1105. 
[02:50:00]  Hmm.  Imus works for CBS Radio, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that true, Ben?  There's all sorts of weird shit going on.  I gotta tell you guys.  Don't do it.  Is that real?  Yeah.  What, has people just called you?  No, they called, but...  No, they called Washington, but Washington didn't want to give your cell phone number out,  so...  They're calling my desk at 1105.  Wouldn't give the cell phone number to Don Imus?  No, it was Don Imus.  It was his assistant, but it turns out...  Oh, great.  Don Wicklin has my cell phone number, but Don Imus can't. 
[02:50:30]  That's real smart.  They're protecting you, Opie.  It could be...  There's a million people who want to talk to you.  It's the right people, because I looked up the name from last time we talked.  All right.  We'll be talking to Don Imus after the program.  Ben, go ahead.  Plant one right here.  You should be in on the phone call, Anthony.  You know, he's your father.  If you guys want to let me in on it.  All right.  So that's happening after the show.  It gets more and more interesting every day.  And a big, huge article on FARC.com about us and the rumors that are circulating. 
[02:51:00]  Love the FARC, man.  A lot of rumors are circulating.  And then people are commenting about the article that was in the Daily News yesterday  about us possibly going back to terrestrial radio.  Go back and own it.  FARC.com is one of the most least recognized radio show prep sites ever.  Radio guys never like giving credit to anything.  And all of them go to FARC, because it's just a collection of really cool, interesting stories.  Crazy, stupid stories.  So they got crazy, stupid. 
[02:51:30]  They got legitimate news stories.  And they put them on like the second they break.  They're up there.  And then I like the Photoshop contests and stuff like that.  I get involved with that whole thing.  I'm like a geek, man.  Well, go to FARC.com.  F-A-R-C.com.  There's a whole thing on us moving back to terrestrial radio.  Go back and own it.  Just don't sell mattresses.  And you guys could make your own comments and stuff.  So FARC has always been really, really good to us.  There you go.  Got to go to the phones really fast.  It's Mark in Cincinnati. 
[02:52:00]  Mark, what's going on?  Tony.  Hey, I got two things for the game show calling in.  All right.  One of them is Jeopardy.  What is plane crashes for 2,000, Alex?  All right.  Is the engine running or not running?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Uh, what is not running?  Ah, yes.  That was Family Feud Jeopardy.  Let's go to Andrew in Brooklyn.  Andrew.  Can't have them all.  Okay, we need the top ten ways celebrities die.  Show me plane crash. 
[02:52:30]  Number one answer.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's go to Bill in Tennessee.  Bill.  Hey, yeah.  I will tell you, I love the show, man.  I've been listening since the beginning.  But let's be honest.  A lot of this is way over your head.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, I don't want to do it.  Who's the guy that answers the phone?  That would be Fred.  Fred.  Yeah.  Or Travis.  Why?  And Pete.  Yeah, he's a dick, man. 
[02:53:00]  I've been trying to call.  I called him about 15 times.  And he wouldn't put me through just because I disagreed with what y'all was talking about.  What'd you disagree with?  What were we talking about?  We were saying that books are good?  Yeah.  I don't believe in that.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  I don't believe in that reading crap.  What's up, man?  For real, man.  I love the show.  But who gives a shit about Sabbath and Jimmy's Norton Little?  Oh, wow.  Oh, dude.  How can you say that?  Maybe you're a little too new to the show.  No, I've been listening since day one. 
[02:53:30]  Who gives a shit?  All right.  Let me tell you, let me tell you who gives a shit.  Nobody.  Except Jimmy.  That's the beauty of it.  And Jimmy's excitement and enthusiasm and zeal for the subject makes us all care about Jimmy.  I personally don't care about Black Sabbath.  I don't listen to their music.  I'm not a big fan of theirs.  I know of their existence.  We could have went to lunch yesterday.  There was nothing in that that excited us.  But Jimmy's enthusiasm for it makes me just, it's like watching Rudy or something like that. 
[02:54:00]  You watch the little kid just kind of get what he wants.  Right.  Radio.  Yeah.  It's like the movie Radio.  He finally got into the game.  Right.  They put him in.  They took him off the bench.  The autistic kid made some three-pointers yesterday.  So, sir, you're not a big fan of Sabbath.  You don't understand the, I'm not sure what you're saying.  How can he be from Tennessee and not like Sabbath?  Those guys still wear their shirts, underwear.  They got their posters up.  I'm glad you got Ralphie May in there.  We're a good comedian now. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, dude, I know what you're trying to do.  Oh, that's a passive aggressive.  Oh, bring it, Jimmy.  Bring it.  Dude, are you trying to, uh.  Go fuck your mother.  Throw your radio in the street.  Dude, you couldn't upset me right now.  You couldn't upset me right now.  Yeah.  If you showed up here and made me eat cornbread with your awful family.  You're a fucking hillbilly and I love Sabbath.  I love buzzards.  All right.  I'm sure you do.  Thanks, fellas.  All right.  Goodbye, fella.  Yeah, everyone is saying.  That's hilarious.  Everyone is saying Jimmy's story reminds me of the autistic basketball story. 
[02:55:00]  Nothing.  Trying to rain on Jimmy's parade and it's a sunny day.  They could sit in your mouth and you'd go, ah, delicious.  He tried to piss on me and what?  It went through the clouds and it came down fairy dust.  Let's go to Stretch in Arizona.  Stretch.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Stretch.  Congrats, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Um, the guy from the dating game was inquiring on whether they had one last session of whoopee  before the plane gone down.  Isn't that the newlywed game?  It's the newlywed game.  The newlywed game.  You dope. 
[02:55:30]  Well, I thought there was something to the bit, but it's failing me.  Well, no.  Chuck Bowie said, uh, all right, the, uh, the audience picked him.  So if, uh, you want to be killed in a plane crash, we'll pay for it.  We won't be back and do it, too.  See?  Now the bit's back on track.  Thanks to Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, man.  Let's go to Todd in Iowa.  Todd.  Hey, I got a question.  Hey, Sweet Nipples.  How you doing?  Hi.  Uh, got a question.  My wife won't let me join Pal Talk.  Why?  Because she's a stingy bitch.  Oh, it's about being cheap? 
[02:56:00]  Cheap.  Yeah.  It's $60 for the whole year, and that's like the top level of, of Pal Talk.  I mean, I spend, you know, well, probably, you know, I spend $60 in the bar every day.  That's probably what she's pissed off about.  $60 a year, and you get the premium level.  It's not a lot of money, mister.  Yeah, $60 in a bar?  Hey, Alky.  Jeez.  Bring it in.  She's using the, we can't afford it excuse.  Yeah, but that's an excuse. 
[02:56:30]  She just knows what the hell's going on on Pal Talk.  There's jacking.  But I'm sitting here, like, on the free version.  I get you guys for 30 seconds, and they get knocked off.  Dude, do you have a credit card?  Yeah, I get a credit card.  Is it in your pocket?  Do it.  You have a computer?  Do it.  Man up.  Let me ask Todd something.  Are you a man's man?  I'm a man's man.  All right.  Then you tell your wife to shut the fuck up, and then you're getting Pal Talk.  You know, we'd like to take her into the octagon, and I'd beat her up. 
[02:57:00]  I'd challenge your wife to a fight.  Why don't you tell me?  Hey, have a Miller Lite and go into the Buy Men Seeking Friends room.  Hey, Bud Lite, don't advertise Miller Lite.  All right, Todd.  Good luck to you.  I don't know what to tell you on that one.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, good job, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  I'm so happy.  It looks like the wife controls the household, and there's nothing we can do about that.  There's the pants in the family.  Wes in Philly.  What's up, man?  What's up, Wes?  Yeah, we're trying to get closer to the actual runway without going over. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  That's nice.  That's funny.  You stop within 100 feet, you get both runways?  Hey, we got a mission for the PES.  Oh.  From ELO.  Boston Globe Poll.  Vote XM.  ELO wants this promoted.  All right.  Where do you go?  ONA.com.  ONA.com.  Opie and Anthony.com.  We need you to vote for XM now.  The PES will be on that for ELO.  Thank you.  Yep.  Let her rip.  Yes. 
[02:58:00]  Apparently, Letterman, Monday night, had Howard on, which used to in the old days.  See, this is just another little thing.  Just pointing out these things.  In the old days, when Stern was on Letterman, guaranteed Letterman wins the slot.  It was a guarantee.  Last night, Stern on Letterman, beat by Simon Cowell on Leno.  Man, that British queen is taking it to the hoop. 
[02:58:30]  I'm Leno.  Well, we got another game show checking in.  Mike in Jersey.  Yeah.  Hi.  Let's play some celebrity password.  Plane.  Wheels.  Plane.  Damn it.  Jimmy, it's to you.  Jimmy.  What's the word?  The password is plane.  Jane.  No. 
[02:59:00]  For eight points.  Okay.  Opie.  Disaster.  This show?  Wait.  They're accepting it.  Wait.  All right.  Wait.  I know the answer.  All right.  What's the password?  All right.  Password.  Disaster.  Retard DNA.  They're accepting that also, but not as the answer to this question.  Time is up. 
[02:59:30]  It was crash.  Plane crash.  A disaster would be a plane crash.  Oscar winner.  What?  Wait.  Oscar winner.  Oscar winner.  Yeah.  Plane.  Train.  Car.  Automobile.  Crash.  Ah!  Oh!  Hey, that was...  Wrong headline.  That was like a real one.  I really didn't get that.  That was... 
[03:00:00]  He actually had a legitimate question.  Yeah, that was very good.  Matt in Boston.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I want to go old school with Kitty Carlisle.  Will the real flaming plane crash victim please stand up?  Or isn't this the old, the old, old game show?  And welcome to this is the last 30 seconds of your life.  All right.  Very good.  By the way, we got under Stern's skin. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  We have some fans of the Opie and Anthony show that work for David Letterman.  Who was telling us that recently, that the writers are...  A couple of writers came to my show.  Are really big fans of this show.  And during the Howard Borefest, that was his appearance on Letterman last night.  Oh, man.  I watched the whole thing last night, and now I'm tired because of it.  And I didn't learn shit about anything.  And I didn't laugh once.  But...  It was really...  Letterman went after Howard about taking Fridays off.  And I'm like... 
[03:01:00]  I'm like, oh, I wonder where that came from.  So what we got here is the original statement by Howard that he would never, never work a  four-day week.  Yeah.  Because he would be jipping his fans.  Jipping his fans.  This is our latest clip that we love playing that gets under his skin.  How about four-day work weeks?  Nah.  The audience gets mad at me if I take a week off.  I can't take Fridays off.  I think the audience would rather have you four days than no days.  How bad are you going to be if you're not there at all?  Well, it's better not to be there.  I believe radio is a habitual kind of medium. 
[03:01:30]  That people wake up in the morning.  They go to work and they want to hear their favorite disc jockey.  Oh, absolutely.  And if you're not there on Fridays, you are doing a disservice to the audience.  And you're not doing your job.  You're not doing it right.  That's like someone going to work and doing a half-assed job.  That's like you hire a guy to do a job and he kind of just sleeps on the job and he just  sort of gets by.  It's like being the president.  Right.  Right now.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So it's all or nothing then?  All or nothing for me.  How about...  If you're going to do this job, you show up every day and you give it your best. 
[03:02:00]  Oops.  You know, I'm not going to come and do this show and jip my audience.  Not going to do it.  Oops.  Oops.  Yikes.  So now, honestly, I really think it's because of us.  Now he has to defend that statement that he made a few years back.  When he was talking about, you know, vacation, you go on Friday, like, how many days you take  off?  He's like, two weeks.  So I got to go off two days since I started.  I wasn't going to sit there and get into a debate with Letterman about who's a harder  worker, me or him. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, okay.  I have the right to take off Fridays.  I mean, he's been taking off Friday since he came to CBS.  And he's all proud of himself because he takes two shows on Monday.  This guy does a one hour show, excuse me, a 43 minute show with the commercials.  You know, he basically puts in five hours of shows a week.  I do five.  Yesterday on the air alone, I did six hours.  I was on until noon.  Right, you already did a week in this time.  And I was on the wrap-up show.  Yeah.  Doing the whole Sal routine with his wife.  Oh, I want to hear about that, too. 
[03:03:00]  I'll talk about that later.  So, you know, I mean, if you want to compare work ethic, in two days, excuse me, in one  day, I do more hours of entertaining.  You did his week.  I did his whole week.  I could take my six hours, break them down into one-hour shows and be done for the week.  I could take my whole show on Monday.  And then you went and did his show.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, and yes, I do have the right to take every Friday off.  And the fact of the matter is, I will take some Fridays off, and maybe I'll take them  all off. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know how it's going to pan out.  No, he is going to take all the Fridays off.  Yeah.  But he's too scared to do it right now.  Can't do it immediately.  And he just admitted it in the clip.  And his listeners are going to be pissed.  And that's why he's slowly but surely doing this, like taking every other Friday off.  And then it's going to be taking two out of three Fridays off.  And then the summer's going to come.  It's going to be every Friday.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  And maybe I'll take them all off.  I don't know how it's going to pan out.  You certainly haven't done it yet.  Tell him.  But the fact of the matter is, well, in the summer, I'm going to take my Fridays. 
[03:04:00]  Well, I'm just saying, you are dedicated enough that you said it's a new venture.  I'm going to work.  Yeah.  I mean, and I could do something very easy.  The last two hours of the show, I could just go dark, tape it, and then play it all on Friday  and say it's a new show.  That's what a Letterman does.  They don't know, man.  I just love the fact that he has to explain himself.  Letterman's having to do new jokes.  They're having to be topical.  Yeah.  This is stupid.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's your question.  Peter Tamarkin is so dumb. 
[03:04:30]  How dumb is he?  He's so dumb, he tried to land his plane in the blank.  Wow.  Boom.  Down, down, down.  Wow.  Boom.  Down, down, down.  Hangar?  A bowl of pudding?  He's got a Richard Dawson.  I said water.  That's pretty good, man.  Let's see if Joe has something similar.  Joe in Kansas City.  Joe? 
[03:05:00]  Dumb Doris is so dumb.  How dumb is she?  She went with Peter Tamarkin on a blank ride.  Coaster?  I'm going to have to think about this.  Charles, stop sucking my cock.  Ow.  Just love to suck cock.  Ow.  Let's go to David, Tennessee.  Hey, good morning.  Hey, guys.  I don't know if our audience can handle two calls from Tennessee today, but we'll try this. 
[03:05:30]  I know.  I'll try.  What's up, Dave?  Welcome to the newlywed game.  Yeah.  What's the worst place your husband ever fell asleep?  Behind the wheel of an aircraft?  That's correct.  See ya.  All right.  Very nice.  These are fun.  They sure are.  I love it.  Hey, we got Isaac Hayes in the news, too.  Oh, he's a, uh...  Yeah.  And we need to send some audio to the press. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, we'll, uh...  Because we're tattletalers.  We're always good for ratting someone out.  We really are.  I'm not being insincere.  Well...  Fucking rats.  Whole show full of rats.  You might have heard by now.  Isaac Hayes has lost faith in South Park.  Plays, of course, Chef on South Park.  After ten years on Comedy Central's foul-mouthed anti-establishment animated series, South Park,  Isaac Hayes wants off because he finds the show's attacks on religion inappropriate.  After ten years?  After ten years.  When the initial pilot show that actually got the show any recognition whatsoever, 
[03:06:30]  because it was kind of passed around, was Jesus vs. Santa.  Right.  And it was completely, uh, sacrilegious.  They attacked Scientology.  Yeah, but he didn't have a gig then.  Uh, right.  And he took the gig as Chef, made some cash, and now...  And they've attacked every religion.  Yeah, but that's where the show...  Judaism, everything.  But the second they touched Scientology, now, I gotta leave the show. 
[03:07:00]  Well, here we go.  Word is that Hayes was upset with an episode that aired in November, Trapped in the Closet.  One of their most famous episodes, by the way.  That attacked Scientology, of which he's a follower.  He asked the show to be released from his role as the sexually charged chef.  And this is his statement.  There's a place in this world for satire.  But there's a time when satire ends, and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins.  Hayes said in a statement.  It was fine until it was his.  You are the Duke of New York. 
[03:07:30]  You're a number one.  As a civil rights activist, this is more Hayes.  Of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices, he added.  Hayes' reaction stumps some, because the show that spawned South Park included Santa and Jesus in a death match.  And throughout the run, the producers have skewered various religions and celebrities.  Of course.  Every religion.  Every religion.  Yep.  When they mess with Tom Cruise, though, I'm out of here.  Yeah.  Here we go.  This has nothing to do with intolerance and bigotry and everything to do with the fact that Isaac Hayes is a Scientologist 
[03:08:00]  and that we recently featured Scientology in an episode of South Park.  Matt Stone, co-creator of South Park, said in a statement.  In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons, and Jews.  He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show.  Good.  To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non-sequitur.  Of course, we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well. 
[03:08:30]  Good.  They're like, beat it, motherfucker.  They ought to kill off the character.  Use audio over 10 years and splice it together to make him, you know, talk and just kill him off in the most horrific Scientology-related way.  Make him trash Scientology if they could do that.  Yeah.  What do you think of Scientology?  It sucks.  It sucks, children.  Well, you ready for it?  Scientology is voodoo.  You ready for this?  Yes.  We got something, and the press might be interested in this.  We'll see.  Is it my picture? 
[03:09:00]  This is Isaac Hayes.  That's not your picture.  This is Isaac Hayes on our show about, I don't know, a few months back, talking about that exact episode.  Yep.  The Scientology episode.  Hey, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  Hey.  Yo.  What did you think?  You're Scientologists, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  What did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on South Park about Scientology?  Well, what?  With Cruz in the closet.  Yeah, that was a great episode.  One thing about Matt and Trey, they lampooned everybody. 
[03:09:30]  And if you take that shit serious, then I'll sell you to Brooklyn Bridge for $2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to realize what they're doing.  Yeah, that's what they do.  Oh.  I'd like a bridge, Isaac.  That was his answer before he went into Scientology, and they bashed the shit out of him and said,  what?  That's beautiful.  I love.  Let's call CNN right now. 
[03:10:00]  We already threw it out there.  We're like, look, man.  It's a huge story today.  We got some audio for you, because we love what people are being-  I got a bridge.  I'd like to sell you.  Yeah.  Where's this whole talk about civil rights?  That's what I want to hear right there.  Yeah.  Civil rights.  Stop.  Over the waters, I guess.  Civil rights.  I'll say-  Freedom.  Without our freedom!  Stop with the civil rights shit when it comes to South Park.  That's hilarious.  I'll sell you a bridge that Brain put a bomb on. 
[03:10:30]  You are the Duke of New York.  You're a number one.  Beated shithead.  No one cares.  You are the Duke of New York.  All right.  Look at the picture of Jimmy and Isaac.  I like it.  Don't take that down, Hawk.  Yeah, take it down.  We don't want him part of this show anymore.  I like Isaac.  He's got no sense of humor.  See, that was a cute picture.  That's a cute celebrity picture.  Oh, look at that.  Me and one guy.  Piece of cake.  So we sent that audio to everybody, and the pest could help us with that as well.  Again.  There you go. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Let's go to Candyman.  Candyman.  Yes.  This is the Hollywood Square, and you picked the center square with little Jimmy Norton.  The question is, who was co-pilot of the plane?  Was it JFK Jr. or John Denver?  Blackie Swelpy?  You're the Duke, man.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tony in Wisconsin.  Tony. 
[03:11:30]  Hey, that's cool as shit.  Listen to myself on the radio.  Hey, when I first called him in, he had no problems with it.  He said, oh, no, you can't take those guys seriously.  Now he's going ballistic and chewing everybody up for going against that.  There it is.  There it is.  It's on CNN right now.  South Park protest.  We got the audio.  How do we get a hold of CNN with our audio?  Call him right now.  Hawk, get it at yourself.  See?  It's a huge story today.  What are they saying?  And we got some great audio.  Can we punch it up?  It's all over Insider, E.T., all that stuff. 
[03:12:00]  Can we punch it up?  Apology.  Matt Stone says that over the last 10 years, quote, Isaac never had a problem with the show  making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons, or Jews.  Now, on to the literary controversy.  How about getting Matt and Trey that audio, too, because they'll make sure it gets to the right people, too.  Yes.  And they'll make sure that it gets edited into a sub-mark.  Yeah, into an episode.  Guys, let's see if it's a good idea.  Well, that's what Matt and Trey do.  Let's see if we can get something done for once. 
[03:12:30]  Get to Matt and Trey.  We have a piece of gold here, right?  Let's see if we can get it to the media immediately.  Hey, Sam, can we strap this audio to your back, and you'll pretend you're Fiona Apple and dance it in there?  You're funny.  Nice reference.  You creepy Malata Mongrel wave.  Both genders will be destroyed.  I'm going to fuck Sam, and it won't even be considered a homosexual act.  What do you think of them apples, kiddo? 
[03:13:00]  Here's the audio.  It's very important today.  Ralphie, what are we promoting today before we go to break?  Well, I've got two Comedy Central specials I'm taping in April, April 22nd, at the Tennessee Theater in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Nice.  It's beautiful.  It's a beautiful theater.  They just spent like $25 million redoing it, and I'm going to go in debauchery.  Nice.  Yeah, so I've got two of them I'm taping in April, and tickets are on sale right now.  Are you doing an hour or a half hour?  Hour and a half on each one.  Jesus.  Will your fluid bag be making an appearance at the show? 
[03:13:30]  No, no, it won't.  It won't.  I'll have to retire it by then.  Hopefully, the wound will be closed up.  I don't think Jimmy even knows about that, do you?  No, what's a fluid bag?  That's never good.  When someone says, how's your fluid bag, my dick's never going to start pumping.  No.  Nothing says comedy like a fluid bag, let me tell you.  What do you got in there?  What do you have a fluid bag for?  I had the operation in December, I had hernia fixed, and they took off all this extra skin  because I've lost so much weight, and I had some wound healing problems, and I have a hole 
[03:14:00]  about an inch and a half, and about four or five inches deep in me that's draining fluid.  It's disgusting, and it's hooked up to something called a wound vac, and it hurts all the time,  and I'm draining it.  That's what Opie was talking about.  How much weight have you lost?  I've lost since November 2003.  I've lost around 280 pounds.  Now, on a radio show, some guy actually dipped a tater tot in the juice that is coming out 
[03:14:30]  of his wound.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  It is really heinous.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  And ate it.  And ate it.  What show is that?  Can we please play whatever show that is?  It's also the show that just tried to do our bit with wasps stinging them in the ball  bags.  Yeah.  But you've got to give him the tater tot, Bitt.  You've got to give him that.  Wow.  That's damn funny.  You want to show Jimmy the juice?  Is it all right?  Yeah.  Is it leaking good today?  Not too good. 
[03:15:00]  You have a bag with you.  Yeah.  A bag of juice.  Pump.  There it is.  Well, the bag is cold.  It just looks like apple juice.  Yeah, that's what it looks like.  It's just apple juice.  Do you think it tastes like it?  I would say not.  I would say it's a blood product.  Does it smell bad?  No, it's got this gel inside this canister that keeps it gummed up.  Look at it, Jimmy.  And it grows.  It's just fluid.  I mean, it's just viscous, thick fluid. 
[03:15:30]  Well, no, it doesn't come out that thick.  Jimmy, can you explain it for Anthony?  He didn't really understand.  It looks like, by your description.  It almost looks like a bag of smooth pulp.  It's almost like a mealy type of fluid.  The little crystals, it looks like an icy.  Like if you were to freeze apple juice.  Like Mott's apple juice.  Delicious.  Mmm.  Mott's.  We love it.  Here at Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you just put...  I'm ready for terrestrial radio when we have to promote mattresses.  I'm going to put my Helix on and put it on the 70s channel. 
[03:16:00]  And not listen to this program.  What's a Helix, by the way?  Could you send three?  Hey, hey, hey, that's my bit.  What?  I want to...  You just did my bit.  I was the devil.  I don't do your bits.  Don't do my bits.  I don't have any bits.  What are y'all begging for stuff?  What bits of mine could you do?  There are none.  Dude, I'm like...  That was my bit where I make believe I'm talking normally and then I just lose it really loud.  That's not your bit.  That was my bit.  I did that.  That was Patrice's bit, a long time for us.  And you're taking my Samantha bit and I don't appreciate that.  I only have two bits on this show.  I have two bits too and they're both under my shirt. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, that's my bit.  That's my bit.  You just did it.  No, I didn't.  Speaking of two bits...  Hey, that's my bit.  So much I charge.  Two bits?  I have two.  I got a quarter.  I got two bits.  I got a quarter?  It's two bits.  Can I have a scoop of peach melba?  Would you like some, Jimmy?  I mean, this is a pretty clean blood product for you.  It looks like...  I got to be honest with you.  I got to be honest.  It looks like mango sorbet. 
[03:17:00]  It is.  It looks a lot like that.  Would you smell that ant?  Not lick it.  Just put your nose over and smell it.  There is not even a chance.  Give you a buck.  No.  Come on, ant.  I don't have any infection.  I'm on Lavaquin.  I'm like the highest oral antibiotic.  How much?  I'm HIV negative, hepatitis negative.  Bodily fluids freak me out.  I don't care where they come from.  Ralphie, Ralphie, I want to get into something, actually.  Yeah, boss.  How much did you weigh at your most or whatever?  At the most?  First, the scale only went up to 750 and it couldn't measure. 
[03:17:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  You were over 700 pounds, dude?  Yeah.  How close were you?  Because I'm obsessed with this shit.  TLC has become the Sideshow channel.  Every Sunday they do like small people, fat people.  Right.  What was the other one that we saw recently?  What the hell was it a couple weeks ago?  It was just so twisted.  And they're making believe they're doing something nice.  Hydrocephalic people?  No, what the fuck was it?  Someone helped me out on the instant feedback.  Every Sunday they do another freak show. 
[03:18:00]  And they make them believe they're doing educational TV.  It's like, no.  It's an excuse for us.  Blaney books the show.  Yeah.  But they were doing the half-ton man.  And they were doing this other guy that was only, I'm saying only because it sounds  like he was close to what you were, 779 pounds.  And he was close to death, so they brought him into the hospital.  Yeah, but that guy couldn't do anything.  Oh, you saw him?  I saw like 10 minutes of it.  He was 779 pounds.  He's been in bed for seven years, and they finally decided to do something about it.  They get him in the hospital and stuff.  Make a long story short, TLC is filming this thing, and the guy ends up dying. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, they're doing a special on him.  And he winds up dying while they're doing the special.  What did he die of?  You saw this?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw it.  It was that big guy.  He had like bed sores on him and stuff.  That's disgusting.  Yeah.  And it looked like it was going to be one of these feel-good TV shows, like here's this  guy in a very dangerous situation.  Well, you know what happens, dude?  Gastric bypass is a real serious surgery.  No, he didn't even have that.  All of a sudden, he had some kind of infection that took over his body.  A staff infection? 
[03:19:00]  But what I want to ask you first, how close were you to just staying in bed?  No, I wasn't.  Because if you were over 750 pounds, that's got to be on the close side of not being able  to move around.  You know, I really had no problem with it.  I didn't go out and do, you know, stupid stuff, you know, I didn't go out and go for  a stroll, okay?  I wouldn't do that, but I, you know, I'd drive 10 minutes, 10 minutes, you know, around a  parking lot to get a better parking spot, but it's also Houston, and, you know, it's  100 degrees and 100% humidity. 
[03:19:30]  That's common.  So is it safe to say you were pushing 800 pounds?  Yeah.  How did you fly, dude?  How did you fly?  I didn't.  I didn't.  I did all my gigs driving.  How about now?  Oh, that's all I do is fly now.  Thank you to, uh, I'll let Reno, uh, get the credit here.  Reno.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, the, on the TLC, I've been addicted to that too.  Uh, did you see the guy whose arms exploded?  Thank you, yes.  What?  The guy, uh, his, his name's Greg something. 
[03:20:00]  Barry Bonds?  Is his name Barry Bonds?  Greg, uh, Valen something.  His head exploded?  He had the world's largest biceps.  Mm-hmm.  And then he had some kind of, uh, cyst or something in one of his biceps, so he tried  to, like, drain the fluid himself, and he popped his own bicep.  He was shooting, he was shooting roids.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, his arms were ridiculous.  Oh, he got that, uh, that, like a pocket.  What's his name?  It looked like a holiday ham, his arms.  What's his name?  Because it's worth Googling, because the pictures they have of this guy are unbelievable.  You got it with the arms?  And they're not photoshopped.  This is what this guy did to his own body. 
[03:20:30]  How did your biceps explode?  The guy whose, oh, his name was Travis.  He was poking it, dude, he was poking it with, uh.  Trying to lift a glass of water.  He was poking it with.  Yeah, did you see him when they were, uh, measuring them, and all of a sudden the tops  of them started bleeding?  Yeah, he was poking it with, uh, syringe, um, hello, help me out.  Syringe?  Syringe.  Thank you, I couldn't say it.  Yeah, needles.  To drain fluid or something that was going on in there.  And when, uh.  What's his name, man?  And when they would go to break, it would show that, uh, that picture, and it just looked  like a head on a big muscle.  Right.  Nasty. 
[03:21:00]  I think we got it here.  But that was on TLC as well.  Every Sunday they'd do another freak show.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy that was 750, remember he had lost all the weight, and then after the show  that he was on, he was on, like, some kind of news show.  No, no, no, no, no.  You're going to confuse everybody.  The show they did on the original guy, he died.  He didn't even, he barely started losing weight before he didn't make it.  And then they were, the show you're talking about was the one after that, which was the  half ton man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:21:30]  That's right.  That's right.  And he died?  He lost all that weight.  And then after that, he just started eating.  Yeah, I'll explain that to everybody.  You know, um...  Because that guy's a local.  Thank you, Reno.  Yes, Ralphie.  I was very lucky, dude.  I don't have any enlarged heart.  I don't have fat in my liver.  I don't have high cholesterol.  I never had high blood pressure.  I got out of it without getting diabetes.  I don't have the sugar.  I don't have anything like that, man.  The sugar.  The sugar.  You got the sweet blood.  I got that sweet blood.  But, um...  So that guy died. 
[03:22:00]  And then they had a show right after that called The Half Ton Man.  Jimmy's checking out the pictures.  His name for everybody at home is Greg Valentino.  Greg is spelled G-R-E-G.  Look at that guy's arms.  That is not a Photoshop.  Does he call himself Opie, though?  No?  Greg Opie Valentino?  Jimmy, what do you think?  Seriously.  That's not Photoshop.  Does everybody get that?  He's got big muscles.  Yeah.  Does everybody get that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, people get all the jokes. 
[03:22:30]  Turn it around for Ralphie.  That's what this guy looked like with the biceps.  The world's largest biceps.  And then he fucked himself up.  He was just...  Okay, what did he do?  He admitted he was so...  He admitted that he's taken pretty much more steroids than anybody else out there.  That's something to be proud of.  Anyway, so then they did The Half Ton Man on TLC.  This guy waited...  Did he die?  No.  No?  This guy weighed 1,079 pounds, and they did the same type of thing.  You know, watch him as he's doing his treatment, and he got down to 499 pounds by the end 
[03:23:00]  of the show.  That's awesome.  Yeah, cut himself in half, basically.  He's not the one that died, right?  No, that was the show before.  Wow.  But during the show, Anthony, and you'll remember Michael Hebranko or whatever his name  was.  This guy's a local that got up to something like 1,000 pounds.  He was like the world's fattest human, and they had to remove him from his house.  I saw that.  Was that the guy that they brought out the forklift?  Yeah, like a forklift.  Yeah, and they took out for the front of his house.  Ready for this?  That was the second time they took him out of the house. 
[03:23:30]  The story goes, the first time, he was up to 1,000 pounds.  They got him out.  They got him into treatment.  I think it was Richard Simmons helped him out.  The guy got down.  Dick Gregory and the Bohemian Diet.  That's who it was.  When did Psycho Mark make a visit to him?  Well, that was the second or third time.  Second or third time.  This is where the story gets great.  So he got down to 195 pounds.  Wow.  If you see the show on TLC, you got to check it out.  It was unbelievable.  It's called Half Ton Man.  He got down to 195 pounds, and they have him on some kind of British talk show saying,  I'll never go back to that.  You know, life is too important, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:24:00]  Fast forward like seven years.  The guy is back up over 1,000 pounds from 195.  Oh, my God.  And then they had to remove him with the forklift and cut out like a wall of his house just to get him out of there.  You got to leave someone in there the second time and go, you know what?  We're just going to put glass around you like a fishbowl.  Yeah, so people can walk by.  I thought at the time, since I was like mobile, that when they told me my weight, you know,  I honestly thought about going up to 1,000 pounds and applying to be an NHL hockey goalie.  You know, get it past me. 
[03:24:30]  Bet you can't.  Bet you can't.  Just blocking the whole net.  Just block it all.  I'd officially become a rectangle.  That's funny.  What are the rules on that?  And I'm a huge hockey fan.  I don't think there would be.  I think that'd be a great call and follow.  Keep him right there in front of the net.  So then.  Get the Zamboni to pop him out.  They get him to one of the special hospitals.  He loses the weight again or a lot of the weight.  And he goes back home, right?  He's now on his third time gaining crazy weight as we speak. 
[03:25:00]  So let him eat until he's done.  Just don't help him.  If he wants to be fat, let him be fat.  Just don't help him.  I mean, stop wasting, you know, the fire.  I have a theory on that.  He got down.  The weight got down and he became a celebrity.  And then that celebrity thing went away.  And now he's like, well, I want to be in the spotlight again.  If I get fat again and then lose it.  And I bet you that goes on in your head.  Like, well, I could gain the weight again.  And then they'll have to talk about me again.  Man, I want to lose this.  I want to lose this so bad.  I'm told by people in L.A. not to lose too much.  Because they're afraid that my jokes are connected to it. 
[03:25:30]  And they're not.  Oh, right.  And they're not.  But I'm like, I'm cool.  And they're like, nah, keep some weight on.  Keep some weight on.  But I want to lose it.  I'm tired of it.  Of course, yeah.  Ralphie.  I got a real hot chick.  You look great.  Compare the first time I ever met you.  It's like night and day.  Dude, I was so tired and stoned.  When you came to the Jay Moore show, I was tired and stoned.  And I was.  How much did you weigh back then?  I was 300 pounds heavier.  I was.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Unbelievable. 
[03:26:00]  Close to 300 pounds heavier.  Yeah.  Jimmy didn't even know me then.  Because I couldn't make it to New York.  All right.  I couldn't make it.  Uh, yeah, let's play a little, uh, what did we learn on the show today?  Steve in Jersey, what's up?  Today I learned that yesterday was the best day in Jimmy Norton's entire adult life.  Yeah.  Congrats, Jimmy.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, that was a very good story, Jimmy.  James in Canada.  Today I learned not to crash your plane into a body of water. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's such a good line up there.  And, uh, Wheel of Misfortune.  Man, we're getting reports that Ralphie killed on Saturday.  Uh, do that plug real fast, Ralphie.  We've got 15 seconds left on the show.  I'm at the Tennessee Theater in Knoxville, Tennessee, April 22nd, taping two, um, specials  for Comedy Central and two DVDs.  So please come out.  Tomorrow night, I am at the Stress Factory with Jim Florentine doing a benefit 732-545-HA-HA-ONE-SHOW-ONLY.  Very cool.  Wow.  Hopefully nobody does the telephone bit. 
[03:27:00]  Gotcha.  I'm out of here. </pre>
