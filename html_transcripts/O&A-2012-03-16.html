<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an interview with Rob Halford, lead singer of Judas Priest.  The conversation ranged from Halford's 1998 coming out and its repercussions, to his vocal techniques, Judas Priest's legacy, a potential Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, and his holiday album, "Halford Winter Songs."  The discussion frequently involved explicit sexual references and homophobic slurs.  A humorous anecdote about Halford filling in for Ozzy Osbourne was also shared.  This was followed by a celebrity guessing game with Rich Voss, marked by mispronunciations and arguments over the rules.

The next segment continued the celebrity name game, this time with Mars, featuring more vulgar language and off-color jokes, particularly around Mars's repeated misidentification of celebrities like Ashton Kutcher and Ren√©e Zellweger.  John Cena then joined the show, promoting his movie "12 Rounds" and his upcoming WrestleMania match.  He discussed the steroid issue in professional sports, his upcoming wedding, his dislike of certain Boston sports fans, and various anecdotes involving other celebrities and TV shows.  The segment maintained a high level of sexually suggestive and offensive humor.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about video games, focusing on Guitar Hero and PlayStation Home.  John Cena briefly reappeared, mentioning being bumped from a Tonight Show appearance for Barack Obama.  The conversation included callers' experiences with online gaming, particularly one caller's antics in PlayStation Home, and comparisons between players' real-life appearances and their online avatars.  Games like Call of Duty, Lego Star Wars, Mario Kart, and Grand Theft Auto were mentioned, along with anecdotes about Guitar Hero, including a past disastrous attempt by Danny.  The segment culminated in a challenge issued to Danny, the self-proclaimed Guitar Hero champion, by a new intern, Evan, setting up a future competition.  Crude humor and offensive language remained prevalent.

The forthcoming Guitar Hero competition between Evan Champion ("The Fireman") and Danny Alvarez ("The Gunslinger") dominated the next segment.  The hosts and studio personalities engaged in extensive trash-talking, debating rules, song selection, and using homophobic slurs and derogatory remarks about various universities and individuals.  Significant side bets were made.  A call from Jason Ellis interrupted, discussing his "Oktoberfist" event involving blindfolded fighting and electric shock, adding more vulgar and offensive language.  The segment concluded with further trash-talking and predictions for the Guitar Hero showdown.

A call from Jason Ellis opened the following segment, which began with Opie and Anthony discussing a feud with someone they called a "cocksucker" and an "asshole," strategizing a "good cop/bad cop" approach.  Ellis recounted having been repeatedly kicked by UFC fighter Fedor Emelianenko. He discussed other antics, including drinking his own urine, and promoted his show, "Ellis Mania."  There was a lengthy discussion about Paris Hilton, with Ellis calling her a "racist" and Opie and Anthony making crude comments about her appearance. A call from Blind Dave, whom Ellis had previously insulted, led to further insults and name-calling.  The segment ended with promotional plugs and more insults.  The final portion saw Opie and Anthony reflecting on a past discussion about race relations and differing interpretations of events, criticizing what they saw as overly sensitive reactions to racial issues.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, here is some random Opie and Anthony show audio, randomly inserted for your listening pleasure.  I'm saving all my love for you.  Okay.  Because I'm saving all my love for you.  Thank you.  Well, see.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He's so good, isn't he?  Well, the woman who wrote in saying that she misheard the song thought it said,  because I'm shaving off my muff for you.  I don't know if muff is a bad word.  Is it? 
[00:00:30]  I can't sing it.  Okay.  Sorry.  By the way, we have the creator of the singing be on today.  Sorry.  Is it a bad word and I just don't know it?  Later on, we'll get the dictionary out for you.  Am I about to get fired?  No, no, no.  Everything's great.  No, it's fantastic.  So let's move on.  Bon Jovi.  And we're going to be decorating cupcakes later on the show.  Let's move on.  Bon Jovi.  Okay, this is bad.  We're going to move on.  Okay, that's enough.  Opie and Anthony on the virus. 
[00:01:00]  You want the worst?  You got the worst.  You want the worst?  Opie and Anthony.  You want the worst?  You got the worst?  You want the worst?  Opie and Anthony.  The worst?  Opie and Anthony.  The worst?  Opie and Anthony.  Rob Halford, everyone.  Nice.  What's up, Rob?  Mr. Halford?  Been seeing you all over the television.  All over the telly lately. 
[00:01:30]  That morning show.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, so you're doing a morning show.  Oh, I am.  Wake up cool.  And I'm like, all right, there's Rob Halford, we know him, heavy metal god, and he's selling  clothes.  Like, what?  I was only there for the male models.  Was that it?  The one was really hot.  I saw a few of those.  I thought maybe you handpicked them.  No, but so many must have been thinking about it, man.  Does that know my type?  I was just going to ask you, do you have a type, or I'm sure you do, what is it, or what  do you find?  No, anything with a penis works for me, so don't get too close right now. 
[00:02:00]  You should all take a piss with us before.  We were doing the you hold mine, I'll hold yours on the bathroom.  Yeah, we're all pretending to make eye contact.  Yeah, there's a really funny video on YouTube from Holland, where there's like three guys  something at the urinal, and the one guy reaches over to the other side, and the other guy  reaches over to the other side.  It's some strange, like, Dutch comedy, you know, that's their kind of twisted sense.  Yeah, that's fair, yeah.  Which is why I have an apartment in Amsterdam. 
[00:02:30]  So it seems like now, it's like you're joking about it, you're very comfortable, it's like  when you came out, it sounded like shockwaves, and then all of a sudden you're back in,  you're doing Judas Priest, and nobody cares.  And it just shows you the, thank you, it just shows you the, my audience don't give a shit,  quite frankly, they just want me to get on stage and do my gig.  Just want you to rock, goddammit.  And I thought it was great, I thought he just showed you the, you know, that the people  that support me just don't care about that kind of stuff.  What finally made you do it?  Like, I know it's a huge decision. 
[00:03:00]  It's a big decision, and you know, there's probably people listening now, they might be  thinking about, should I step forward?  Or sitting to your left.  Yeah, you got...  They misunderstand transsexuals.  He looks like he's just coming from the meat part.  What's that part of New York?  The meat-packing district.  The meat-packing district.  Who doesn't love a girl in a dress with an extra gift?  Jesus, they act like they've never fucked a tranny, Rob.  I don't get it.  Jesus Christ.  It's just girls with giant clits.  Yeah, so anyway, yeah, it was a good thing to do. 
[00:03:30]  It's a great moment.  Was it something, were you, was somebody threatening to out you, or did you just go, you know what,  it's time?  No, I mean, if that had outed me, I could have, quite frankly, give a shit.  At that point in my life, I was just having so much fun with my musical career, you know,  and especially being able to fulfill a lot of my music outside of Priest.  I was just ready for everything and anything.  And it felt like the right thing to do.  I would have never have done it while I was in Priest, because I love my band so much. 
[00:04:00]  And, you know, I think that's the big dilemma that people that are going through this struggle  have to face.  You're putting everybody else first, and that ain't the way to live, you know.  You've got to put your own house in order, and then you can have, you know, you can do  whatever afterwards.  Especially with a band like Priest, because that, you know, especially at that time of just  in the 80s, you know, 80s with, you know, Vince and Nicky and all those other great guys. 
[00:04:30]  And the irony is all the guys were looking like chicks in the 80s.  Yeah.  In bangles.  They got all the fucking lipstick on and the rouge and the fucking, like, tranny hairstyles  and stuff.  You know, how ironic.  But, no, anyway, it took a while, but it's always been out in the open house.  It's nice.  Have you been political?  Have people asked you to be political about it?  Yeah, they have.  They have.  And where do you just go?  I'm seeing Larry a little bit lighter on.  Mr. Flick.  On his show, but I'm not smart enough to do it.  Wait, Rob, you've been out since 93?  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  I'm not smart enough to deal with the issues.  There's far more articulate people that know what's really going on.  I know what the basics of the struggle are, but whatever.  To you, does it just seem like, you know, this is my life, and I don't have to get up  on a fucking, you know, pulpit and discuss this, that, the other thing.  It's just, all right, here it is, but now I'm going back to doing my music.  Yeah, that's all I live for.  I've been, you know, I've been a professional metalhead for 38, 39 years now, doing what  I love, you know, and just because of this thing that's also there. 
[00:05:30]  You don't have to be a spokesperson.  I just want, just give me a mic and let me wail.  A mic, a bill, a peach, whatever.  I know a really hot mic in the Navy, actually.  The Navy.  Is it, now, is that a stereotype?  I'm working my way through the arms, sir.  Is it, is that a stereotype or just a joke that gay guys like the guys in the Navy, or  is the Navy the one that tries you to do?  No, it is.  I think that's just, it's a joke.  It's a stereo.  It's a stereo.  But on that point, I would just like to give a shout out to all the veterans, because 
[00:06:00]  it's Veterans Day today.  Yes, it is.  So, you know, even though I'm a Brit, and I spend most of my time in this country, I  know how important this day is for the vets.  We've been pals with the Brits since like the 1700s.  Yeah, we gave you this country, you know, we said, you want America to keep it, you know,  we'll just go back to our little island in the middle of the Atlantic.  Sent a few people over to make us feel good, like we won it, or something.  Like, oh, look, let them think they won the fucking country.  We don't even want the shit anymore.  Yeah, but there are some residual things hanging over. 
[00:06:30]  Like, we have the tea over in England, but you Americans like to do the tea bagging.  Tea bagging, yes.  You know, you're heavily into the tea bagging right now.  I'm like, my friends are texting me, going, the Americans are tea bagging.  At last.  Figured it out.  We took a boring beverage and made a fun scrotal humiliation out of it.  Jesus Christ.  And here's the thing, here's the great statement.  It's like, I went and saw you guys, I'm a Heaven and Hell freak, and I fucking love Priest,  and I went and saw Heaven and Hell Priest in Jones Beach. 
[00:07:00]  And it's like, nobody can care about anything about your personal life, watching you perform.  It's like, it's fucking, it's Halford and it's Priest, and the fucking, it was as good as it was fucking 20 years ago.  I mean, your voice is held up.  That was a great tour.  That was an amazing tour.  The Metal Masters tour.  Yeah, it was Motorhead.  And it pissed down the rain, again.  Oh, did it?  At Jones Beach, it always rains.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It always rains.  It always rains.  And you've got to get all the gear through a tunnel.  That's God angry with your lifestyle.  Strike me dead. 
[00:07:30]  God doesn't want to strike him dead.  He's just, oh, a little rain on everyone.  A little rain, yeah, ruining my hair.  But, yeah, that's, you know, apart from whatever.  It's a real good venue, and all the strong Islanders are there just going crazy for the band.  And how do you keep your voice, like, because, you know, a lot of singers, man, they just lose it over the years.  And you, one thing I've heard about you is you've kept that voice over the years, man.  I don't know what it is.  I was talking to Alice yesterday, back in Phoenix, doing his show. 
[00:08:00]  Cooper?  Yeah, and we were just talking about the way we deal with it, you know, and Alice has got a remarkable voice for the, you know, the character that he plays and the stuff that he works on.  We both use these in-ear monitors, which is a real blessing, because up until that point, you were screaming above the guitars and the drums and trying to get yourself heard.  Did you ever feel, though, in the early days where you did have stage monitors blasting at you, that it made you push more?  Yeah.  Like, and kind of, and almost, like, I always thought it made it sound a little better to me to yell a little more during certain songs. 
[00:08:30]  Whenever I used an ear monitor, it was, like, too esoteric.  Too clinical.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, again, we talked about that point, because he was really resistant to it for that very same reason, and so was I.  And then there was a show I went to many, many years ago, and it was Sebastian back in Van Halen, and he'd got those things in his ears.  I said, what the hell have you got in your ears?  And he goes, oh, dude, you know, Sebastian, you've got to try these other great things, and they'll save your life, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:09:00]  And that was it, so from that point on, I've used them.  But, in fact, I probably am able to get more into my performance now, because I can really hear what I'm doing.  Save your fucking ears, too, man.  Exactly.  Like, standing in front of that shit for that very same reason.  But the rest of the guys, you walk past Glenn's stack, and it's like a, you know, an H5 hurricane.  You know, I mean, it's just this wall of fucking noise.  It's just absolutely, and then he's got the monitors, and he's, you know, you know, when you get the wind blowing in your face, he's pulling his skin back in his stomach. 
[00:09:30]  You're feeling the fucking, you're feeling the speakers, the air coming off of him.  How the hell does he do it?  It's amazing.  Did you deal with any tinnitus or anything?  Because you guys were fucking, like, loud.  Yeah, still, the band is still, like, incredibly loud.  Yeah, no shit.  But, I mean, that's what, you know, that's what we're about to imagine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, nobody wants to fucking hear Electric Eye played softly and acoustically.  Well, I told you that time, I went to fucking, I went to see a band that I grew up just loving for the, you know, fucking hardcore was Blue Oyster Cult. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I loved Blue Oyster Cult.  So, and this is going back years ago now even.  I went to go see him in Huntington, and I'm listening to him doing these songs, and you could turn to who was next to you and go, oh, this is great.  They're doing astronomy.  And you'd be like, I don't want to hear him like this.  I want to hear him loud, just full volume.  Yeah, and the pre-show is, I want a beer, right now!  And then you still don't, you know, get the message across.  But you have to use sign language at pre-shows.  There is some, there are some bands, though, that were very heavy in the day, and then they lightened up and turned into a whole other entity where you guys kept, kept rocking, right? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  You know, and you, to this point, even still, you know, the volume's up, you're fucking kicking ass, you know?  Yeah, Nostradamus is a really, really intense record, you know, some, got some really strong stuff on there.  And, and so it is, you know, you might wonder, I mean, metal is everything, you know, a band like Priest can be the painkiller,  and then we can do, like, Beyond the Realms of Death, you know, but, but the essence of what, what, what we do. 
[00:11:00]  And what I'm doing now with my solo stuff, I think, is still got the, the vibe.  It's a cool thing, it's called, uh, Halford Winter Songs, and it's just got you on the front with, like, a winter, kind of like a white, snowy background.  Yeah, but I wasn't there, that's, that's a green screen, I was in Phoenix, and it was 120 degrees outside.  How funny is that? I was wondering why you were sweating in the snow.  Yeah, exactly. And I, I, that's some kind of Norwegian wood vibe going on.  I look like a serial killer, don't I?  Yeah, you really do.  That's not the picture I want.  That's totally awesome.  This is like, this is like, supposed to be like a, a Christmas holiday thing, I look like a satanic serial killer. 
[00:11:30]  Looks like the professional, he's about to fucking save a plant and kill somebody.  That kind of works though, man.  But, uh, the only problem I had with this was I couldn't read, because it's written in like a calligraphy.  Old English?  Yeah, it was hard to read some of the, uh, song titles.  Yeah, it's supposed to look, you know, cool, but I even, I mean, what, what does he say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you imagine if I'm going to ask you?  There's one here called, uh, uh, Come All Ye Faithful, obviously we know, Oh Holy Night. 
[00:12:00]  Uh, and then there's I Don't Care, Uh, Light of the World.  Why am I reading these perfectly now that he's here?  Because I couldn't read them before.  Yeah, he couldn't read it.  Uh, Christmas for Everyone.  How many of these are kind of classics? There's ten songs.  Six of them are the classics, and four of them, uh, the band wrote, yeah.  Did you always want to do it, or is it, you know?  Well, you know, I loved the holiday season, and, you know, the eating and the drinking  and the hanging out with your family and friends and stuff, and there's always music in the  background, and there's, for me, there wasn't enough of this kind of vibe going down, so 
[00:12:30]  this took a while to put together, but now we've done it.  What style, what style is this now?  It's rock, it's some, that opening cut, getting to the spirit, you know, it's got all the intensity  of, like, the painkiller vibe.  Really?  We've got to play one of these.  Yeah, absolutely.  Lots of drums and screaming vocals, yeah, it's a real, real good opener.  I've been a big, uh, critic, I'm sure Eddie Trunk talked to you about this, too, of the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and just how fucking shitty they've been to metal, but after Sabbath  got in, uh, it seems like it's opened the door, and now Metallica's in, but bands like  yourself, uh, I mean, do you guys think you'll be in the, in the hall or Motorhead? 
[00:13:00]  I don't know, I'd love to, it would be, it would be a great honor, because it's, you  know, it's, it, it carries a lot of value and a lot of, uh, prestige.  I don't know how that game works, how do you, how do you even get in it?  I don't know, who the fuck votes?  It's, it's guys that are in it, and also a lot of older, it's really a shitty system,  but now what they're doing is they're putting guys like LL Cool J to be nominated, Madonna,  simply because they probably weren't making money, so they want to open it up just as  a money-making thing.  Oh, great, yeah, that, that keeps its credibility.  Yeah, but it's, it's disgusting that, that you guys aren't in, or that Rush isn't in, 
[00:13:30]  I mean, just bands that contributed so much.  You know what it is, bands that were very, I think bands that were very influential over  the years, and, uh, not, not copiers, but, but leaders, like you guys, when MTV first  broke, and...  We were, and Priest was one of the first bands.  Yeah, you guys were on there, and I remember fucking turning it on and just going, holy shit,  you know, to sit there and watch a Priest video.  So, you'd, you'd, yeah, there was like 12 songs.  Yeah, there was Devo, and there was fucking Priest, and a...  Chilliwack, I think, was one of them, right? 
[00:14:00]  But you'd fucking sit and watch that, because, you know, except for, like, Don Kirshner's  rock concert, you weren't really able to sit and see and watch a band, uh, uh, performing  like that, unless you went to the shows, so...  Yeah, I mean, I think it's influential, you know?  Yeah, and we had a lot of fun making those videos, I mean, you've seen them, you know,  hot rocking in the sauna, or setting me on fire in...  Set me on fire in freewheel burning, and, you know, blowing people up in another thing  coming.  One of the, one of the funniest fucking Beavis and Buttheads were when, I think it was You 
[00:14:30]  Got Another Thing Coming, I'm not sure, and, uh, Butthead goes, what's he doing with his  shoulders?  You're like, you're like dancing at...  Yeah, skip out of that, skip out of that fucking limo.  I was laughing my balls off.  You know, I don't know.  What's he doing with his shoulders?  I don't know, but this rocks!  He didn't care.  Yeah, that was a great day out in Soho, in London, next door to the pub, you know, we 
[00:15:00]  were all, we were all pissed as farts, drinking between takes, it was just a crazy day.  We were watching some old 80s videos, do you ever look back at old videos and stuff and  like, go like, ugh?  Yeah.  Like, is the one you look back at?  Yeah, absolutely, shouldn't you?  It's like me and Turbo Lover.  You know, what is that look?  What's going on?  You're a Turbo Lover.  You know, I'm all spritzed, I'm all spritzed and bulging and everything.  So Turbo Lover should be.  That's what it is.  Oh, no, this is Painkiller.  Yeah, Painkiller.  This is one of my all-time favorites. 
[00:15:30]  I feel like killing you.  Yeah.  Here's the plan.  Hawk.  Goddamn.  He's a butthead rocker.  Goddamn.  What a fucking voice.  Dude.  Jesus.  Now I just want to listen to you.  That's the way you start your day.  You really did just want to fucking kill something.  That is music to kill by, man. 
[00:16:00]  Holy shit.  What a unique fucking strong voice, man.  There's nobody that sings like you.  Yeah, with that range, too.  You got one fuck of a range, man.  It's probably because I just got one testicle.  Is that it?  Yeah, I only got one, sadly.  Do you really?  For real?  Oh, come on.  I have two big balls.  And you know, they're hanging to my knees at this time of my life.  Which is where I'm wearing loose pants.  And I've gone commando when I got Opie and Anthony. 
[00:16:30]  I was going to get mad that it wasn't in your bio.  I was going to scream.  How do we not know this man has one ball?  We could talk about one ball for an hour.  That's easy.  Well, Hitler only had one ball.  Did he really?  Yeah.  It made him a little angry.  Which is what he started with.  Yeah, the compassion ball didn't drop.  It made him a little testy.  Oh, stop.  It's actually pretty funny.  We got some fans on the line here.  Let's go to Jeff in St. Augustine.  Jeff, Rob Halford in studio today.  Rob.  Hello, Jeff. 
[00:17:00]  How are you doing?  We were down.  We played in your location recently, didn't we?  Did you come see us?  I damn sure did.  Okay, cool.  I've seen you about six times now.  All right.  Back to the Screaming for Vengeance tour.  Well, you go way back.  That's great.  I go way back.  And I just wanted to let you know that you're real fans.  You're true fans.  Yeah.  We knew all along that you were gay.  Never had a problem with us.  There you go.  There you go.  I was hiding and I didn't need to hide.  Does it feel like...  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but go ahead. 
[00:17:30]  Go ahead, Jeff.  No, that's good.  I was just going to ask Rob, because you're in the metal scene, which is such a kind of  like an alpha male or aggressive chick fucking scene.  Right, right.  Did it feel dishonest or did it feel...  How did it feel living like that and knowing you had to present a certain front, which did  not a big part of who you were?  It wasn't any real big deal to me because I was already established in my work, you know,  and so I was just doing my gig.  Never even...  You just don't think about that kind of thing.  You just go out and do your metal and that's what it's all about. 
[00:18:00]  But I mean, if you had somebody that you were seeing, like you knew like you couldn't  be photographed, like, you know, like you guys walking around with your chicks or whatever.  Yeah, but the irony is, you know, for the longest time, I mean, I didn't really come  to the terms of understanding about myself until really later in life, you know, like  in my mid-late 20s when I was trying to figure it out, because I'd been hanging out with chicks,  I'd been fucking chicks up for, you know, for the longest time, and so it's just that 
[00:18:30]  that's why it was kind of a crazy feeling and all that's going on.  So, you know, but I think the main thing when you're a professional musician is that, okay,  that's in your life, but your main aspect is just doing the best gig you can possibly  do.  I think, yeah, you know, your sexuality is a part of your life, but you have other things  that kind of take precedent, your fucking work, your career, your music, shit like that.  And then, you know, when you want to fuck, whoever the fuck you want to fuck, you fuck them. 
[00:19:00]  That's it.  That's pretty much it.  That's how I think about it.  It's just like, you know, whether you're hetero or you're fucking gay, it's not like,  all right, I like fucking girls.  How is that affecting my job?  No, but...  It's really not.  No, the question I was asking is only because of people's perception.  It could make it a different perception.  Being in Priest and...  Yeah, like, was it frustrating to ever, like, you know, if me and my girl go somewhere,  whatever girl they're dating, I'm doing comedy, if we want to go somewhere anyway, walk in 
[00:19:30]  with her, was it frustrating to, like, have to say to that person, like, well, we have  to behave this way now because there's people or there's fans or whatever?  I don't ever recall being in that circumstance, quite honestly, no.  And I think, again, just because, you know, I was putting my band and my bandmates and my  fans first, which I still do to a great extent, you know, you didn't put yourself in those  kinds of scenarios where somebody could take a picture or the rumor could start.  And that's the other crap. 
[00:20:00]  You go through all the stupid fucking childish rumors and innuendo and I'm like, I'm sick  of this.  Let's get it out of the way, you know, and there it goes.  Did you talk to your guys first, your band, or did you talk to them first?  No, I mean, you know, just to reflect on the moment, I was doing something for MTV.  I was working in that two project with Johnny Five and Trent Reznor, and I was up at the  MTV studios here in New York, and I was like, yadda, yadda, yadda, blah, blah, blah, and  speaking as a gay man, bang, bang, bang, and the guy dropped his clipboard.  Plunk. 
[00:20:30]  And then it was like a firestorm around the planet for like two or three days.  Did it slip out or did you just highly fuck it?  Yeah, because, you know, in all honesty, it wasn't a planned event.  Yeah.  I was just riffing away and just talking, and it happened, and I thought, whoops, there  it was, you know.  Must have been a load off your show.  Oh, wait, off your mind.  He did.  Yes, it was a load off.  Yes, yes, it was all of that.  Let's go to Maximum.  Maximum.  We got Rob Halford in studio.  Yeah, Rob. 
[00:21:00]  Maximum.  Is that your real name?  Is that your real name, Rob?  Is that like Trojan Maximum?  Maximum.  Anyway, Rob, what's up?  Well, I just want to tell Rob that Judas Priest was the first metal band I ever listened to.  Yeah, great.  You guys fucking rocked.  Thank you.  And I kind of got out of you.  Out of you guys, wasn't really listening to you.  And recently, I heard Nostradamus.  Yeah.  And I thought it was older shit.  I mean, you still have it.  You sound great.  You're fucking awesome, Rob.  Thanks, man.  I really appreciate it.  That's really cool.  Do you know about this guy in Cleveland who has listened to Nostradamus every single day 
[00:21:30]  of his life since he came out?  Really?  Yeah.  He's listened to it about, I don't know, when did that record come out?  Like, almost two years ago.  So, he's listened to it close to a thousand times.  A thousand times.  And he dresses up like Nostradamus.  And he's a bachelor.  But he has a dog.  And he sits there.  And he comes home from work.  And he dresses up as Nostradamus.  And he gets his dog.  And he puts it on.  And he sits there.  And he listens to the whole record.  An hour and 40 minutes or whatever it is.  Two CDs of Nostradamus. 
[00:22:00]  That's just...  I don't know what it is.  It's insane a little bit.  It's his most insanely dedicated priest fan you could ever wish to know.  But I was just talking to some friends in Cleveland on the radio the other day.  And they go, hey, I said, what's up with Jim?  He goes, you might have to stop listening.  You know, there's some strange things going on right now.  It's getting a little odd.  You know, we're getting to about 958 plays.  You know, after work.  But that just goes to show that priest fans are the best fans in the world. 
[00:22:30]  What does he do for a living?  That's the important question.  I never asked him.  I met him.  I never asked him.  Please find out what he does.  Because he might just drive around and lop heads off.  That's a serial killer.  Let's continue with the phones.  Ron in Georgia.  Ron.  Hey, I was wanting to ask Rob if there was a plan to do a Screaming for Vengeance tour  like they did with the British Steel album this last time.  Thanks, buddy.  You know, I don't know.  What year was Screaming for Vengeance?  1980-something and so many Google issues. 
[00:23:00]  I would guess 82.  You know, it must be nice to be able to go like, what the fuck year was that?  Yeah, that fucking massive head.  Yeah, that huge head or something.  I don't know.  Google it.  It's like, Google it for me.  I do know that British Steel turns 30 years of age next spring.  It's the 30th anniversary, British Steel.  Wow, shit.  And that's why this guy was just mentioning, we just went through America on our second  leg and we flipped from Nostradamus to getting the party started early for British Steel. 
[00:23:30]  We made a movie and it's going to come out in the spring of 2010 to go with the official  anniversary.  Oh, really?  What's the movie all about?  Like documentary kind of?  Yeah, just the live show.  Yeah, live show.  And anything else we can find to put in.  You know what song is very underrated by Priest fucking, and if you're not like a hardcore  Priest fan, you should go, it's a fucking rapid fire.  What an underrated fucking song that is, man.  Of course, that's the, you know, there were two versions of the way the running order went 
[00:24:00]  over in America.  It started, British Steel starts with breaking the law.  That's the way the label wanted it.  But everywhere else in the world, it starts with rapid fire.  So that is the first song that we played on this current British Steel tour.  And what a great, the opening line, the first thing you hear is, pounding the world like  a battering ram.  Yeah, it's fucking, do you have that at all?  It's fucking, such an underrated song.  Let me go.  Budge me.  Yeah.  Pounding the world like a battering ram. 
[00:24:30]  Jesus, this is fucking phenomenal.  Pounding the furnace of the final grand slam.  All I want to do is listen to this song and tap Rob and go, do you remember when you sang  this part?  The annoying fanboy.  Yeah, what's that, what was that like, Greg, a comedian from Saturday Night Live?  Chris Farley. 
[00:25:00]  Chris Farley, when he does that thing with McCartney.  You remember when you were in the beautiful world, he was like pulling his hair out.  That was awesome.  That was awesome.  We love that.  Hey, let's go to Greg in Atlanta.  Greg.  Greg.  Hey, I wanted to, Rob, big fan, man.  Thanks, bro.  And Ovi and Anthony and Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Big fan.  I wanted to ask what was the meaning behind, or what was the idea behind covering Diamonds  and Rust?  Jimmy was just bringing this up the other day.  I brought this up the other day because I finally heard, what a fucking, I literally 
[00:25:30]  was teary eyed.  I got very emotional when I don't sleep.  Oh, Joan Baez.  Joan Baez's version.  I couldn't stop fucking listening to it.  I could not stop listening to her version of Diamonds and Rust.  What?  Maybe.  Mary.  I knew you'd ruin it.  All I could think of, by the way, is I'm enjoying this song, is of him going, why?  Shut it off.  He ruins everything.  What made you cover that song?  It was such a great cover.  Yeah, it was the label's idea.  We were starting to make headway in America, and, you know, they said, we need a track for 
[00:26:00]  radio.  I mean, this is going, what, 80-something, 81?  So, yeah.  No, before then.  Give us a minute.  We'll get some fucking hits for America, you asshole.  They sent us, I remember we were in Rockville Studios in Wales, which is a great, really  famous studio, and they sent us a 45 record, vinyl, and they said, this is our idea.  So, we huddled around the record player and put the record on, and then you hear this  little guitar twink in and twink in.  Hi, I am your friend. 
[00:26:30]  Exactly.  Here comes your voice.  Thank you.  They want us to do a metal version of this.  Yeah.  But the truth of the matter is, it's a beautiful song, it's an incredible song, and a great  song.  We'll take any interpretation, so we kind of put our stamp on it.  And then fast forward to Live Aid in Philly, at the JFK Stadium in 86 or something, and  I'm backstage, and there's this lady walking up to me, and it's John Baez, and I'm thinking,  oops.  She goes, I just want to tell you, that's my son's favourite song that I've ever done 
[00:27:00]  that's been interpreted by another band.  I thought, how cool is that?  What a nice lady.  You know, somebody else would have, you jerk, you screwed my song up.  Yeah, you fucked my song up.  But anyway, she was really cool, and it worked.  It's become part of the catalogue of the movies.  Most people don't even know John Baez did it, to tell you the truth.  Exactly.  It's the same when we did Green Man Alicia, which is a famous Peter Green song, who was  in the original Fleetwood Mac lineup.  You also did, and I think I met you very briefly at K-Rock one time when you were doing Ian's 
[00:27:30]  show.  No, he doesn't remember, Jim.  He does, because I said, hey Rob, look at this face, and I stared at him.  No, we were talking about when he performed in Philly, because Ozzy, his voice wasn't holding  up, or he was ill, or whatever it was, but you performed, I think, with Sabbath, and did  the entire catalogue for the show, with Tony, Gieser, and Bill, which, that must have been  pretty fucking great.  Yeah, and it was a surprise.  I knew I just said that.  I had no question.  I don't know why I did that. 
[00:28:00]  You just did that.  But, yeah, the deal is, it was the day or two after my birthday, and I'm in, we're in  Philly, and getting ready to do the show, and I get the phone call, and it's Sharon,  and she goes, hi Robby.  I said, hi Sharon.  And then, they sent me some really cool, dark, evil, black leather luggage with skulls  all ivory.  I said, yeah, thanks so much for the luggage.  He goes, well, I'm not really calling about that.  This is my Sharon Osbourne.  Actually, if you close your eyes. 
[00:28:30]  Isn't it rubbish?  Yeah, no.  Close your eyes and put your fingers in your ears.  It sounds just like, it sounds and looks like Sharon Osbourne.  But anyway, she goes, I said, well, what's the deal?  She goes, well, you know, Ozzy's not feeling very well.  I said, oh, what's wrong with you?  He's lost his voice.  He's got bronchitis.  Oh, okay.  So, can you help out?  What do you want me to do?  Well, can you sing for him?  What do you mean?  Can you step in for Ozzy?  Yeah, well, yeah, when, when, when do you want me to do it?  Tonight.  What?  Wow.  This is like four o'clock in the afternoon?  Tonight?  And she goes, well, you know, you know all the Sabbath songs and you, you know, you love  Ozzy and Ozzy loves you and you can't do the show and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:29:00]  So, cut a long story short, they, a motorcycle courier came over with a video of the show from the last night.  I get on my tour bus, go in the back lounge, put the video on and I'm singing acapella with Ozzy as the bus is going to, was it Camden?  That was it, tweeter, center and Camden, yes, for the Philly audience, yes.  Going on, you know, through the rush hour traffic and blah, blah, blah.  So, just as we get there, I've done the show, get off the bus, go on stage, do the priest gig, come off stage, have a shower and go back out stage with Tony. 
[00:29:30]  Holy shit.  Wow.  What the fuck, did they have the teleprompter or did you know the words?  Oh, teleprompter.  Did the crowd know it?  No, I said, I said.  When did the crowd find out?  Literally when you walked out?  Yeah, let me tell you what happened.  Yeah, because I'm wondering what kind of reaction that would be.  I said, I said to Tony, I said, there's a crowd now and he goes, I'm standing with Tony, he's got, you know, he's ready to go to work.  I said, have you told the crowd?  And he goes, Bill's going to tell him.  I said, Bill's going to tell him.  Gonna.  Bill's not a good word.  Bill's going to tell him. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, they don't know.  He goes, no, Bill's going to, Bill's going to read, read a note from us.  Oh, shit.  I said, they don't know.  That puts you in a bad spot.  So anyway, I said, oh, fuck, what's going to happen?  I said, Tony, I said, if they start bottling me, I'm at, I'm at the, I'm at that fucking stage into my tour bus and I'm driving to wherever.  He goes, oh, it'll be fine, Robbie, it'll be fine.  So anyway, the, you know, the, the crowd's waiting and waiting.  It's a sold out show and the promoter walks out and everything quietens down. 
[00:30:30]  You could hear a fucking pin drop.  20,000 people.  And you could hear one of them fart.  So he goes, we've got an announcement and Bill wants to come out and tell you what it is.  So there's like.  So Bill wants to say, it's Bill Ward, yeah.  And he goes, hello, everybody.  I've got a note here from Ozzy.  I am not able to sing tonight.  Boo!  Yes, sir, boo, boo.  This is to Bill.  Poor old Bill.  He goes, yeah, I've got a really bad voice. 
[00:31:00]  I've got bronchitis.  My doctors have told me to take a couple of days off.  So my good friend, Rob Halford, is going to sing for me.  Boo!  Boo!  Oh, shit.  And I'm looking at Tony and we've got like, you know, fear in our eyes.  What are we going to do?  So anyway, the intro tape starts and I walk out and, you know, we start whatever song it is.  And I said to Tony, I said, it's always four in with Sabbath, four bars in.  I said, just give me the nod.  So all night, long time, he was nodding, you know, and like, come in now. 
[00:31:30]  And I'm like, trying to concentrate.  But we started and the first song started and they had a fucking ping on their head with a plastic beer bottle.  So I thought, I've only sung a fucking line and they're throwing shit at me.  And then somebody gobbed a big loogie at me and I thought, this ain't going to work.  But the deal was, the deal was, like, two minutes later, the whole thing flipped.  And that wonderful crowd just accepted it and they thought, hey, this is better than nothing.  And it ended up being a bit of rock and roll history. 
[00:32:00]  And it's Halford singing Sabbath.  I couldn't say it.  Exactly.  You know something, you might go there thinking, I want to see Ozzy, I want to see, but, you know.  But you saw something different.  Yeah, man.  I heard it was phenomenal and people said it was really a memorable show.  You're never going to see that again.  It's not like some fucking nobody just walked in as fucking Rob Halvert.  And not only this, and Jimmy, please, nothing against the great Ozzy Osbourne.  I would hope not.  But I bet Rob hit all the notes.  It's just all I'm going to say. 
[00:32:30]  Tony was smiling.  This is unique.  Wow, cool.  They should release that.  I love my Ozzy.  He's my best mate.  And, you know, he was seriously sick.  He's a lot of fun.  But, anyway, he recovered for a couple of days later.  They're saying that Rob has to go in a couple of minutes because...  All right, let me...  I want to see...  Tony, go ahead.  I don't even know if we can get this done, but let's see.  Tony, go ahead.  Hey, Rob, can you give us a rock scream?  Is it too early for a rock scream? 
[00:33:00]  We do some rock screams on this show.  Oh.  We're terrific at it.  The...  Oh, God.  You're basic...  I'll fucking...  I'll do the...  Jesus.  Holy crap.  Now, that's it.  Both of my balls fell off.  God.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  I need to go change my dopamine.  I need to go change my dopamine.  I need to go change my dopamine.  I need to go change my dopamine.  I like that.  Too early in the morning to do that.  God damn, man.  We got it done.  The fucking fact that you can still do that after all these fucking years and do it at 
[00:33:30]  like 10 o'clock in the morning without any warm-up is amazing.  Oh, that's why they call me the metal god.  We really got to get them out of here.  All right.  Well, thanks for coming, man.  Thank you, fellas.  And Rob, let me know the phones are lit.  They all just want to praise you, but we just couldn't get to too many of them.  I love you, my fans.  You're the best.  And I hope to see you next year.  Awesome.  Rob Halford, everyone.  This is the worst of the Open Anthony Show, Sirius XM.  Mars, you ready to play a little game with Rich Voss?  Let's do it. 
[00:34:00]  Let's do it, right?  We're going to play, well, we're just going to show you guys celebrities.  And what?  And you guys got to just say the celebrity's name.  It's as simple as that.  Now, just to show you where you're at, a little look at your competition, Rich.  Rich, Mars, once again, we had that big star for the X-Files and Californication on Friday.  David Duchovny.  There you go.  It's Duchovny.  What?  David Duchovny.  Mars, what is it?  David Duchovny. 
[00:34:30]  And Rich?  David Duchovny.  David Duchovny.  All right.  So how do we do this, Dan?  You picked out some celebrities?  Yeah, I have a list of some celebrities.  Tell us the celebrities so we can maybe explain in such a way that the listener at home understands  who we're looking at, okay?  So guys, don't say anything until we ask.  Who goes first?  Can I sit at the big boy table?  I'm really happy that you asked ahead of time there, Mars.  Yes, you can.  Thank you.  Can I tilt that computer a little bit? 
[00:35:00]  He can't see.  Okay.  There you go.  Batman.  No, Rich.  That's a screensaver.  That's the fucking background.  He got so excited.  Oh, this is going to be easy.  All right.  Show us the first celebrity.  Me and Ann will try to describe it for the audience at home.  The first, it's actually celebrities.  It's a twofer.  Ooh.  They've been in the news a lot recently.  Kate and John.  What the fuck did we just say?  Who said that?  The both of them.  I didn't say the name yet.  Mars did.  I got it.  Mars just blurted it out. 
[00:35:30]  And he said Kate and John when everyone knows it's John and Kate.  Yeah, Gosling.  Gosling.  Right.  All right.  There's an example of how we're not playing the game.  Right.  So there's a prime example of how this is not played.  There was one direction and it couldn't be taken.  Yeah.  Not by me.  Not by me.  One fucking rule.  And it also shows that this is going to be very good because Mars actually said Kate and  John.  Yeah, I know.  The legal citizen didn't jump in.  Nothing. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  Stop chewing the gum, please.  Huh?  Stop chewing the gum.  No.  It's called a cud.  Thank you.  Are we ready?  That poor gum.  Let me keep score here.  So.  All right.  Your first celebrity.  Who's going to start?  Well, but wait a second.  How do we?  We don't just yell him out.  We got to eat.  You know, it's not.  There's no buzzer.  There's no.  I mean, isn't.  You know.  This is like when they do the Jeopardy parody on SNL.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  The rules couldn't be simpler.  But who goes first?  Should we take turns?  I said we're going to take turns.  Okay.  Well, who goes first on the first one?  We're trying to figure that out.  That's not hard.  You flip a coin.  It's odd or even.  It's either him or me.  How about you guys play rock, paper, scissor to find out who goes first?  Let's go.  I'm fucking an adult.  I don't do that kind of shit.  Yeah, you do.  Best out of three.  Two scissors.  Okay.  Two rocks.  Of course they think the same.  Paper cover rocks.  Paper covers rocks.  Okay.  That's one.  Best out of three.  With Voss's hand, it's like pebble, postage stamp, and tweezers. 
[00:37:00]  And you guys don't even know.  You go like this.  Come on.  You do a fish shake.  If I do that, I might cum.  You want to see Mars' abs?  No.  Just asking.  All right.  Best out of three.  Mars is down one.  Down one.  Here we go.  One.  I won.  Rock crushes.  Scissor.  Rich Voss goes first.  Oh, okay.  Danny, you ready?  Okay.  So, Voss is going first.  Voss, who are these people? 
[00:37:30]  Are we going to go back to them?  Yeah.  I thought that was the first one.  That's easy.  He said it already.  John and Kate.  What?  It's the last name that...  Oh.  Gosselin.  Should have just moved on.  Yeah, let's move on.  Yeah, move on.  That doesn't count.  Was that the last name?  That doesn't count.  It's...  Close.  Yeah, Gosselin.  Gosselin.  Yeah, yeah.  He would have...  Probably Gosselin.  Probably would have fucked it up.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  The next celebrity.  Rich, you start the competition here. 
[00:38:00]  Don't look at the name.  Yeah.  I can't see the name.  All right.  And describe this.  Of course, he was in Fargo.  He was in Fargo.  He was in Armageddon.  He was in...  Con Air.  Con Air.  He was in...  His cameo in, I think, just about every Adam Sandler movie.  Yes.  Hang on, Mars.  In Sopranos.  He was in Sopranos.  In Sopranos.  Very good, Mars.  Good knowledge right there.  But Reservoir Dogs.  Reservoir Dogs.  Very big.  And he played Buddy Holly, the waiter, in Pulp Fiction.  All right.  There he had it.  And I got this off the tip of my tongue. 
[00:38:30]  Steve Buscemi.  Because he was also in...  I think I Love My Wife with Chris Rock.  And I worked with him on the set.  Steve Buscemi.  You worked on that movie?  Yeah.  I was one of the...  Not the...  I was one of the...  Punch-ups.  I want to...  I want to...  You got Chris Rock coffee?  You got Chris Rock's coffee?  No, I was one of the punch-ups.  I want it decrackinated! 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  So, Voss, that's your final...  Yeah, Steve Buscemi.  Mars?  Steve Buscemi.  Okay.  Well, but how...  You know what...  They're not going to be...  No, no.  They need separate celebrities.  Yeah, separate.  So, Rich Voss got his celebrity.  Okay.  So, he got his celebrity.  All right.  Yeah.  One for one.  Now, of course, you know, since he said it...  All right.  So, now it'll be Mars' turn then.  Now it's Mars' turn.  We go to Mars.  All right.  Mars, let us describe the celebrity before you say it.  Don't look at the screen.  We want the listeners to play along at home. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  We're going with this guy.  Ah, yes.  You might know this young man from Transformers.  Okay.  He was in Transformers.  All right.  And then he was in that other movie, Transformers 2.  Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.  Oh, he was in that last Indiana Jones that no one really liked.  Um, and he was in the Transformers movie.  You ready?  Yes.  Um, Shia... 
[00:40:00]  Lebef?  Lebef?  Wait, wait, wait.  What's the full name?  You got to put the first name and the last name together there.  It's, um...  I think it's Shia.  I don't know his first name.  Well, just say the name.  Shia Lebef?  Lebef?  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Now, when we have a fucking abortion name like that, can Rich get a chance to steal? 
[00:40:30]  Ooh, I like that.  Well, it doesn't matter.  I have no clue who this is.  But that's a good idea.  All right.  Do you want to steal?  Why don't you try steal?  Because that was just not the right name.  Rich has one.  Morris has zero.  But I don't lose anything.  Oh, you know what?  We should have where you could lose it, but...  Well, then if you steal...  Then you got to get more.  Then you got to get one and a half if you steal and one if you lose.  Oh, let's not make it complicated. 
[00:41:00]  You don't lose a point.  All right.  Just for fun, what's his name?  No stealing.  Fantasy?  I have no idea.  I couldn't tell you.  Write his name out so Rich could say it.  Just so everyone at home knows.  Okay.  I have no idea.  How did you say his name?  I didn't see those movies.  Morris, once again?  Shia Leboeuf.  Shia Leboeuf.  Shia Leboeuf?  Shia Leboeuf.  And Rich, please let everyone know at home. 
[00:41:30]  Shia Leboeuf.  All right.  Let's see how confident he was.  That's the best part.  Oh, my God.  Looks around the room like, I got this one.  All right.  Shia Leboeuf.  Very good.  And now we're back to Mars.  It's one.  Rich has one.  Mars has a zero.  Now, what is this for?  This is for a boss. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Oh, who is this guy?  Very popular actor.  Played Johnny Cash.  Oh, I got it.  He was in Gladiator.  Gladiator?  Mars saying it's easy.  Hold on a minute.  And was also in...  Oh, that dumb Shyamalanma ding-dong movie.  Yes.  Which one was he in?  The Village, I think.  And Signs as well.  He was in Gladiators.  Signs and Gladiator, yeah.  You said that?  Well, Rich said Gladiators.  Gladiators.  It was called Gladiator.  All right, Mars?  You said it's easy.  More than one show was Gladiators.  Rich makes a point there. 
[00:42:30]  That is true.  Mars, it's to you.  No, it's to me.  It's to Voss.  Oh, it is to Voss.  Joaquin Phoenix.  That's what I'm saying.  Could you say it again?  No, I can't because I already won.  No, just for clarification.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm having a problem.  Yeah, me too.  I'm not sure.  No, it's...  No.  Wait, wait.  What is not except Joaquin?  Wait, wait.  What's his name?  Take me to the Waldorf Astori.  Joaquin Phoenix.  One more time.  You know what?  That never happens.  No, no, because I'm not sure if you're saying it right or not. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, we're trying to give you a point about Joaquin Phoenix.  No, he's wrong.  Joaquin Phoenix.  It's wrong.  It's not black.  It's wrong.  Joaquin Phoenix.  It's wrong.  It's wrong.  It's not wrong.  It's wrong.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Take me to the Waldorf Astori.  This is great.  You almost had it.  Mars, you want to try?  You can steal.  Joaquin Phoenix. 
[00:43:30]  Joaquin.  It's nice.  You too.  Wait, Rich, you said what?  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  And Mars, what did you say?  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Holy shit.  You're both fucking...  Well, how the fuck did I get it wrong?  What is it then?  It's Joaquin.  Joaquin.  That's what I said.  You said Joaquin.  You said five times Joaquin.  Joaquin. 
[00:44:00]  First of all, here's the difference, okay?  It's a soft end, too.  It's barely...  It's Joaquin.  Oh.  Over one letter.  Letter.  Well, that's...  Well, that's called either getting it right or wrong.  Right.  What the fuck?  We're not grading on a curve here.  They don't say, well, he only got it wrong by one letter on a spelling bee or something.  Oh.  All right.  Go ahead.  It's still one for Rich Voss, zero for Mars.  Zero for Mars.  Whose turn is it?  It is now Mars' turn.  All right.  Good. 
[00:44:30]  Next celebrity, please.  Mars.  All right.  We go to a theme prominently featured in the X-Men movies.  She was also married to, I won't say the name, but I guess...  He used to...  He was on Full House.  He was on Full House.  I don't want to blow it by giving the name.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right, all right.  Relax, Rich.  Relax.  That's about all she's done.  She's the blue chick in fucking X-Men. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  Very good.  Rebecca Ramjin.  I'm just kidding.  What?  You are fucking phonetic Mars, man.  I'm going to call you phonetic Mars.  That's his new name, phonetic Mars.  All right.  One more time, just to make sure.  Rebecca Ramjin.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Rebecca Ramjin.  No point for you.  Zero.  Rich for the steal. 
[00:45:30]  Rebecca Stamos.  You cheated.  How did I cheat?  She's not.  She's not married to him anymore.  No, she's divorced.  And that was her...  We're looking for her original maiden name.  Well, you didn't say that.  Oh, just shut up.  I'll play along.  What's her original name?  Rebecca...  What?  Mars, tell them.  Ramjin?  See, it was Rebecca Ramjin Stamos.  Right.  But it's not Ram...  Stamos anymore.  But there's no more Stamos.  So what's her name?  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Rebecca Ramjin.  Yeah.  Rebecca Ramjin.  No.  What?  You got it wrong.  That's why you're stealing.  Look...  You stole the same thing he did.  And we gotta...  We gotta tear down every wall possible today.  Yeah.  This is no fucking joke.  No, no, no.  This is the real deal with these two.  Please, please don't even think this is a fucking...  Please believe this.  I beg you.  They're coached or they're fucking goofing.  This is too classic.  I don't want anyone thinking that this is like a setup.  Well, here's where you said we can't say his name, so then you were saying technically... 
[00:46:30]  Well, because I was thinking because...  My thinking was if you heard Stamos, that you would go, oh, and then remember the rest  of her name.  Yeah.  I was with Anne on that.  So I didn't want to say it.  Well, Anne, it's still one zip.  It is.  It is.  Which one did you get right?  I forgot.  By the way, it's Rebecca Romaine.  Romaine.  As in lettuce.  Oh, Romaine, yeah.  It's spelled Romaine.  Now, Mars, say it now that you know it.  Rebecca Romaine.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:47:00]  Romaine.  We're going to ask you in five minutes, though, and watch.  It'll be a different answer.  All right, are we up to the next celebrity?  All right, here's our next celebrity, and this is for Voss, right?  Yep.  For Voss.  For Rich Voss.  Who is this gentleman?  Ah, you might know him.  He is...  The number one Twitterer.  He is the number one Twitterer.  He is fucking Demi Moore.  I'm married to Demi.  He was in that 70s show, and maybe the movie Butterfly Effect.  And also, dude, where's my car? 
[00:47:30]  Dude, where's my car?  There should be enough info.  And punked.  Ashton Kushner.  Or Ashton Kushner.  We get Ashton Kushner.  Okay, with Mars is still...  Is there an official answer?  Ashton Kushner.  No, no, no, it's not the official.  Ashton Kushner.  All right, Ashton Kushner.  We'll accept both those answers.  Mars?  Mars, it's you.  You can steal, because...  I don't have to try, do I? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  I do?  Yeah, yeah, you gotta steal.  You got this one, right?  Well, you can't lose any points, you don't have any.  Yeah, so just give it a whirl.  It's a free steal.  Yeah.  Wait, did I get it wrong?  Yes.  Of course you did.  Mars?  Ashton Kushner?  Isn't that what he just said?  At least I said it with confidence.  Say it again, but articulate it a little better so we can hear it.  Ashton Kushner.  Ashton Kushner.  All right.  Wow.  Un-fucking-believable. 
[00:48:30]  What?  Completely wrong.  Chris wants, from Ontario, wants just dueling banjos in the background for these two.  Maybe lightly in the background.  I think I was...  I thought I had it right.  Ashton or Ashton?  Ashton.  Yeah, okay.  Kutcher.  Ashton.  Ashton.  Oh.  Kush.  Kushner.  Kutcher?  Oh.  Now you got me all fucked up.

[00:49:00]  Ashton Kushner.  Right.  All right.  Danny?  Wow.  Oh, they're calling it drooling banjos.  You're right, Steve.  Drooling banjos?  Voss is up two, uh...  Two nothing.  How is he up two?  I only got one.  What are you talking about?  It's one nothing.  See how...  We didn't give him the Johnny Cade.  Yeah, I think I was counting the Johnny Cade.  Yeah, no.  It's one nothing.  I don't see.  That was the example.  Mars?  It's the Jew thing.  What's that?  He's giving him a...  I just said I don't see.  Look at the races.  Can't get along.  The Racer Rican and the Jew.

[00:50:00]  I know the face, but I don't know the name.  Oh, boy.  You want to steal Rich?  I don't even know.  Honestly, I don't know his name.  I know the shoulders.  I don't know the name.  You want to write it down for Mars?  Okay.  Mars is very good at letting the audience in on...  Yes.  Phonetic Mars.  Phonetic Mars will let everyone in on who we're talking about.  Mars.  I got it.  Danny's writing it down so the radio audience knows who we're talking about. 
[00:50:30]  Mars will now read the name.  Drooling.  Drooling banjos.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, Mars just made a face when he saw the name.  There you go, Mars.  Tell everybody who it is.  John Kranciski.  Why?  That seems to seem right.  That's the point, you idiot.  He was looking at it.  It was written in front of him.  I'm telling you, this is the Jeopardy pit.  Now that's the same fucking list.  It really is.  To have the name spelled out in front of you. 
[00:51:00]  I'm going to let you see it again real quick.  Yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  Real quick.  You don't even have to do it real quick.  Go ahead.  John Kranciski.  No.  I got that one.  Let me see it.  All right, Rich.  John Krasinski.  Isn't there an N in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's an N.  All right.  Here we go.  There you go, Rich.  Rich is still leading 1-0.  It's a battle. 
[00:51:30]  It's a battle of the nitwits.  Wait, wait.  How do you say it?  John Krasinski.  You have to pronounce the N.  He did say Krasinski.  I did.  That's not it, though.  No.  K-R-A.  No, I mean Rich said Krasinski.  Yeah, Voss did say Krasinski.  Oh, I thought Voss got it.  I think he got it the first time, and then he fucked up and said Krasinski.  So he doesn't get it.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  I think it's a steal.  Sorry, your final answer.  All right, who's up next?  Rich? 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Rich leading 1-zip.  Okay.  This is fucking too easy.  This is a very easy competition.  1-0.  We've done 10 names already, I think.  Here comes the next celebrity.  Rich Voss is up.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute now.  She was Alec Baldwin's love interest on 30 Rock.  She's a, what is she, Mexican?  Latino?  What a great scene in Dusk Till Dawn, where she dances in the titty twister.  And being Hispanic, I think, or what is she? 
[00:52:30]  Latino.  Mexican.  Is she Mexican?  Thank you, Mars.  Mars is going to get this one.  She's kind of short, too.  This is not fair.  Mars has to get this one.  It's not even fair.  Wait, who goes first?  Selma Hayek.  He just winked at me, you fucking weirdo.  Wow, look at those giant breasts.  Yeah, they're heaving.  I guess Rich gets one, huh?  Rich gets it. 
[00:53:00]  All right, Rich has got two.  Mars has zero.  We're going to the next celebrity.  Mars is up.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I'll say.  That's good.  Now we're just looking at semi-clad pictures for Selma Hayek.  Nothing wrong with that.  Hi.  Who is?  Why is Mars throwing his hands up in the air?  Because this is an easy one.  Rich has been getting the easy ones.  The easy ones is fucking up, too.  All right, this actress is known for her weight gain when she does those stupid movies. 
[00:53:30]  Bridget Jones Diary.  Oh, that's easy.  Bridget Jones Diary.  All right, well, Mars is saying you're getting the easy ones.  That's easy.  All right, well, then Mars could get a point here.  Yeah.  That's it.  Bridget.  Yeah, that's about all I know her from.  Bridget Jones Diaries.  She rhymes with a racial slur.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, my God.  It does?  It does?  All right, go ahead.  Mars, you got this one.  Come on, Mars.  Come on.  Rebecca.  All right, Rebecca.  Rebecca.  Selma, Rebecca, stay long.  Rebecca, good.  Swellinger.  Swellinger.  I think he just got us fired.  He said it reminds me.  He seemed to like the gentleman.  Wait a minute. 
[00:54:30]  All right, Mars again.  We need a final answer.  You're close, my friend.  Can I see it, written?  No, no.  Your final answer.  Because you're close.  You know it.  You just got to think it out.  Swellinger.  Swellinger.  Oh, my God. 
[00:55:00]  He sure is.  Wow.  Oh, you put the dumb and stupid.  What was the first name again?  I don't speak wasp.  So, Rebecca, right?  Rebecca.  All right, so Rebecca Swellnigger is the name. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Now, Rich, you get a chance to steal because that could not be more wrong in every way, shape,  or form, ethically, morally, and phonetically.  Yes.  Yeah.  Rene Zellweger.  It is Rene Zellweger.  See, it's Wigger.  We got to ask him about the one he got right five minutes ago. 
[00:56:00]  What was it again?  Say that name again.  Oh, yeah.  Who was that?  Oh, that was...  Don't say it, though.  That was Rebecca.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  The Rebecca one again.  Rumshin?  Right.  I told you.  Just give it five minutes.  Oh, God.  You got it right.  Remember?  All the goldfish brains.  All the goldfish brains.  Roman.  Roman.  Very good, Roman.  All right, now.  Goldfish.  It's three-zip.  Rich is running away with this. 
[00:56:30]  It's three-zip, so I think that we should at least...  Rebecca Romulan.  The score doesn't even matter.  It doesn't, but let's give Mars at least a chance to get a point.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, I know he just went.  Voss is way ahead.  You wouldn't mind if we just give him one, see if he can get it?  Yeah.  Let's go for it.  Put a massive post picture up there.  Let's see what we can do.  Oh, hey, rape.  All right, the next...  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah, this is very good, Danny.  You're right about this.  Now, look at this guy's ass. 
[00:57:00]  We were just talking about this guy yesterday.  Yeah.  We were on the Jay Leno show with this guy.  With this gentleman.  He was sitting on the couch with us.  He was in...  Sexiest Man Alive.  That horrible movie that I just saw where they went, like, scuba diving.  Oh, Girlfriends of what?  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past was one of his latest movies.  He was in...  The one with Kate Hudson.  Yeah, that was a crappy one.  Which was, like, that other one, Gold Digger or Gold fucking Nugget. 
[00:57:30]  And that's the other one where he's leaning on the girl on the cover.  Yeah, there's a lot of those.  That's every cover.  Matthew McConaughey.  What?  What?  Did someone study?  Could somebody say that again, please?  Matthew McConaughey.  Holy fuck.  I'll give it to him.  Wow.  Voss just farted, too.  Voss did.  You lost the shutout, Voss.  I got to get the oxygen.  Holy shit.  I would have put money on that one.  No shit.  I would have, too. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  Well, I'm out of names.  I mean, we could come up with more, I guess.  Shit, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do the chick from Hand the Rocks the Cradle or...  Rebecca DeMornay.  Thanks, Rich.  All right.  It's my turn.  Fuck, I'm trying to save time.  We got a big interview coming up.  We do have the big interview.  Yes.  We're late for the big interview.  They're listening, so I'm sure they're finding this just as amusing as we are.  All right, good.  We're going to get a mod suit. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  Hold tight there.  Who?  Sorry.  Let's see.  Is this?  Oh.  We had her.  She's been in the studio.  Very good.  She was...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She was in...  Fucking...  Yes, the...  I'm trying to think of the latest movies.  What movies are those?  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil movies.  The Resident Evil movies.  I have no fucking idea.  She looks like a pretty Mackenzie Phillips.  Does that seem a little?  Not at all.  No.  A pretty one?  No, not at all.  Well, then again, all four of you look like a pretty Mackenzie Phillips. 
[00:59:00]  You can never use the word pretty and Mackenzie Phillips at the same time.  Who's that guy going on with Patrice?  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, there's something.  There's some giant black woman on Maury.  Oh, Boss just threw a Patrice bash out there for no reason.  What did he do to you?  Who is that girl?  She is fucking hot.  Mars has got it.  Mars, we had her in a couple times.  Yeah.  She seems to enjoy the program.  No, go ahead.  I'll give it to you.  I'm going to pass to you.  Andrew Dice Clay interviewed her. 
[00:59:30]  Resident Evil girl.  We can even write it down for you.  Oh, you can write it fucking down and he would never get it.  All right.  All right, here we go.  It's written for you.  Ready?  Jovo.  It's our first name.  Yeah.  Mila?  Mila?  Mila?  Jovo.  Jovo.  Jovo.

You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  I still get it wrong if I read it.  Go ahead.  Yeah, let him read it.  I'm reading it.  Yeah.  All right.  Now he's reading it.  This is good.  Jovo.  Jovo.  Jovo.

That was the best one ever.  That could be the line of the year.  Oh, that is fantastic.  That could be the line of the year.  Wow.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  I think we're wrapping up.  Yeah, that's...  Do you have anybody else?  Yeah.  All right.  How do you say it?  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Oh, oh.  You mean...  This guy?  How do you say it?  Yeah, this one's from the Daily Show.  Well, he was on the Daily Show.  And then he has his own show.  He's got his own show.  That is after his name, so we can't say that.  I recognize the face.  I don't know the name.  Oh, too easy.  You want to read it?  That's too easy.  Do you know the girl?  You didn't know the girl?  No.  That was Mila Jovovich.  Jovovich.  Yeah, Jovovich. 
[01:01:30]  Jovovich.  I couldn't say that anyhow without making a mistake.  All right.  What about this guy?  Now this gentleman?  I recognize him, but I don't know his name.  All right.  It's written for you.  Where?  I'll write it down.  All right.  A little writing down of...  Of this gentleman's name.  This gentleman.  Of course.  Very funny.  You got this, Rich?  Very funny, man.  I know the guy.  Stephen Colbert?  The L is silent.  Stephen Colbert. 
[01:02:00]  Stephen Colbert?  Just because you say it twice doesn't mean it's going to be right.  It's a second time.  Cigars has gone.  Stephen Cold Beer.  Denver Pest Stephen Care Bear.  We're getting a request for the Heroes chick.  Okay.  We can do that, too.  A couple requests coming in for the Heroes chick.  I just watched it last night.  Thank you, Rex Kramer.  I want to enjoy this bit.  Hang on.  I watch this fucking every night.  Do you?  You like the Heroes?  Well, don't blurt it out.  Well, I don't know her name.  Do you want to try it first, Rich? 
[01:02:30]  No, I don't know her name.  Is it the little blonde?  Oh, my God.  Aggravating.  She's like the fucking...  No, I got the one with the hula hoop.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Her fucking character.  He reminds me of Jack Bauer's daughter on 24.  That's the same girl?  Jesus Christ.  That's a good picture of her.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of showing off her gymnast legs.  She fucking...  Mars?  Isn't it...  Oh, God.  You already lost.  We're giving...  We're letting you run with us now.  Go ahead, Mars.  I bowed out. 
[01:03:00]  You got it, Mars.  As a matter of fact, I surrender.  You won.  I gave it to you.  Again, I don't know her name.  I don't even care.  All right.  We're writing it down for you.  I don't even know how to spell it.  I get it.  How old do you think she is?  Hey, just read that.  She has such a kissable tummy.  Yeah, you're going to be all right with this, Mars, because it's sort of...  Such a creep.  Hayden Penetary?  Wow.  It's pretty good.  It's kind of a Latin thing, almost. 
[01:03:30]  Penetary.  What's the space museum by the Museum of Natural History called?  The Planetarium.  What is it?  What do you mean what it is?  What is the name for it?  Hayden Planetarium.  All right.  There you go.  I thought you'd say that for her name.  She's fucking...  She is hot.  I'm trying to think.  We got one more, or we...  I think we might be done.  I'm done.  She is really hot.  Oh, yeah.  I do have one more, actually.  This will be the last one.  Find a hot girl.  Got to get ready for the big interview. 
[01:04:00]  Now, don't look.  Oh, no.  Not just yet.  Oh, no.  I think Voss might have a good try at this.  Yes.  No.  Something tells me that Mars might know it, but here we go.  Mars?  Another guy that was on that 70s show.  Yep.  Played the dopey fucking foreign kid.  Yep.  And since then, he's just been annoying on, like, Punk'd and all sorts of other things.  I think they did the rap battle show or something, too. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, right.  Right.  No, the mama joke show.  Yeah.  Mama.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Benny?  William.  William?  This is a bad one, because it's a Hispanic name, and I do not know it.  But you're Hispanic.  You're probably related to him.  So you can't really show him the name, because then he'll get it right, because he knows  how to read Spanglish.  Barcelona.  William Valadarima. 
[01:05:00]  Valadarima?  William Valadarima.  Very good, Mars.  William Valadarima.  Very good.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh, pretty fucking good, man.  Fuck no.  No, it's not.  Nice.  You can try again on his first name, if you want.  Yeah, didn't even get that one right.  That's not right?  No.  No, it's not William.  It's Vilmia.  Can I see it? 
[01:05:30]  No.  I don't know it.  What?  Voss's abs?  Oh, I can't now.  Do you really want to show the abs to Mars?  This is...  Yeah!  Look at that, huh, Mars?  Nice.  Mars is into it.  Mars goes, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know that guy.  I'll let you look at his name.  Yeah, but he's going to know it.  I'll let Mars finish on a positive note.  Let's see if he can finish on a positive note.  I don't think he'll get it.  He will, because it's a Spanish name, isn't it? 
[01:06:00]  Doesn't matter.  There you go.  Wilmer Valadarama.  Valadarama.  Rich Corinthian letter.  I just wanted to buy that car.  Wilmer Valadarama.  Uh...  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  I am from Espa√±a.  Eric from Maine is right.  How the fuck...  I did pick up on this.  How the fuck did you miss what Voss said?  When Mars was trying Stephen Colbert, Voss said the L is silent.  Oh, did he? 
[01:06:30]  I did pick up on that.  I heard it, but I thought he was goofing.  I thought it not.  Oh, you thought he was goofing?  I swear, I just assumed he meant the T.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Oh, my God.  We're just in a silly, silly mood today.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Jay Moore.  Yes.  And superstar John Cena.  Most importantly, John Cena's here.  Yeah.  John.  Guys, what's up?  What's up, John?  I'm back.  Again. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Again.  Thank you for having me, by the way.  Not a problem.  Of course, your big day coming up.  I know.  Fighting for the championship.  Indeed.  25th anniversary of WrestleMania.  Anthony's a huge fan, man.  No, I asked Sam.  No, I...  What are you kidding?  I'm a fan.  I like the WWE.  He's also a movie star.  We're looking at a movie star right now.  12 rounds.  Big week coming out.  All these guys.  12 rounds.  You think he's going to lose with a movie coming out, you dopes? 
[01:07:30]  What are you out of your minds?  The movie comes out before the match, so who's to say?  The star of 12 rounds and almost the heavyweight champion of the world.  That was Bruce Buffer, not Michael.  Bruce Buffer.  Oh, yeah.  That guy sounds insane.  When he does the UFC vibes.  The new champion of the world.  I'm not my brother. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, he didn't want to sound like anybody else in the family.  He got you something.  Yosemite Sam in a tuxedo.  Oh, you varmint.  The rudeness.  Chattanoogie.  Michigan General.  Now I got to go to the ship and get another match.  John, 12 rounds.  What is it about, man?  It's an action flick.  I play a beat cop who brings a super criminal justice by mistake. 
[01:08:30]  He vows revenge, breaks out a year later, takes my girlfriend, and forces me to go through  12 rounds or 12 challenges to get her back and save the day.  Nice.  Takes your chick.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Why isn't there that scene where the guy's just like, you know what?  I should get another one.  And the movie.  Yeah.  And the movie right there.  The girls are...  God, they're stupid in movies.  They really are.  And constantly, like, when the hero guy comes around the corner and, like, holds the gun  and he's like, I finally got the bad guy. 
[01:09:00]  And then the bad guy kind of smiles and reaches into some dark corner and pulls the chick out  in front and you go, I told you to stay where you are for a reason.  Yeah.  You're ruining everything.  God.  Mr. Bond, in exactly 14 hours, the pendulum will begin to swing.  11 minutes to the day, the shark will be released from the tank and begins swimming towards  you.  And the shark looks hungry, Mr. Bond. 
[01:09:30]  Hungry for secret agent?  John Cena will dive into tank.  That's all I got.  You look like you're going to court.  You all right?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I got...  Parking tickets or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got some stuff where I got to be gussied up today.  What's up with you guys wearing the suits these days?  They are just very professional.  CW11.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The traffic report.  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on out, Havi.  Not Havi.  Come on, Hav.  But, yeah, just making the rounds.  We got a lot of promotes, so I got to wear many masks.  I don't even think he knows he hit on something there.  Oh, I know.  Well, I love this.  Let it go.  I do.  There's a whole traffic thing on that channel in regards to this man right here.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  You guys told me that before.  So Mick Foley set that one up.  Yeah.  Remind me to thank him.  I was on CW11 like two weeks ago.  Yeah.  It was at St. Patrick's Day. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And they cut to her live in the street, but no one was in the street yet.  And she just looked like the last person on earth running up in the street.  She looked like I am legend.  Yeah.  With a stupid hat on.  Just a drunken legend.  In just seven hours, the place is going to be packed.  It's going to be off the hook.  Stop talking like that.  You're not on Ricky Lake, do you?  Yeah.  What's it like to not get cut out of a movie, John?  Wow. 
[01:11:00]  You're the big star of the movie.  It's fulfilling.  Should I turn the question around and ask what it's like to be cut out of a movie to you?  That's wonderful.  It'll make you do a sitcom.  Right on.  Okay.  What'd you get cut out of?  Street Kings?  I was up to 215 pounds.  I was like Mysterio, brother, for crying out loud.  And there's like entire scenes of me and Keanu talking, and it's just from over my shoulder  to his gorgeous face.  Gone.  All gone. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Big scenes.  Who knows?  Because it's, you know, do you want to show this guy with his porn star mustache that  looks like Kerry Collins, or do you want Keanu Reeves?  Maybe I'm not as good as I think I am.  Maybe that's why.  You know what I got?  You know what I got just last night to pop into my kaleidoscape player down there in  the theater?  I got Go, and I got Suicide Kings.  Didn't get cut out of those two?  No, you did not get cut out of those.  That's back when I had heat.  That was...  Suicide Kings is a good effing movie, man. 
[01:12:00]  Those are two great fucking movies.  Go is hysterical.  Fucking love that movie.  And then Suicide Kings, you know, it's fucking great.  What about The Marine?  The Marine?  Yes.  I don't want to put that on front street, but that's probably the best film.  It's the best film in the history of cinematography.  Of any film.  Do you have any John Cena movies in your system?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, The Marine.  Yeah?  That's the one and only.  That's the only one so far.  Soon to have two.  So far.  It's going under the Cena collection.  I'll get you the bootleg.  That is starting.  Oh, I got it already.  All right.  Right off the bat. 
[01:12:30]  I paid for it.  Hey, John's in the paper today, too.  What did he do?  Yeah, I made the news, I guess.  A little mad at A-Rod and the steroid thing.  Yeah, well, a lot of people see you and they go, he had to be on steroids.  My goodness.  And I know you haven't.  I mean, you've said it a million times.  Come on.  You did something.  Come on.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  And of course, one day a real rain is going to come, John.  Don't get nervous. 
[01:13:00]  Don't get nervous.  My party.  Once again, the media kind of take me out of context.  It's not necessarily I was mad at A-Rod.  I just think, you know, all these guys are getting caught or busted for substance abuse  or performance-enhancing drugs.  This has not just started with A-Rod or Barry Bonds or whomever.  This has been going on for quite some time.  And the drugs are illegal.  And I think the athletes take these chances because there really is virtually no penalty.  A-Rod's still playing, still getting paid.  You know, Bonds had a great career off it.  All these guys are still doing what they're doing.  And if you took the penalty and let pretty much the government get involved and send 
[01:13:30]  these guys to jail, then they're sacrificing contract money, they're sacrificing sponsorship  money, and they have a criminal act.  And going to jail?  And going to jail.  You know, the drugs are illegal.  We're going to lock up our baseball players?  Well, if they're essentially quote-unquote cheating and breaking the law, you know, it  obviously would make that choice a little bit more difficult.  But it's America.  Is it against the law?  It's like Apple Pots.  To actually do steroids?  Yeah, they're actually banned.  It's against the law.  But we're the only country that bans them.  Like, you can go to Europe. 
[01:14:00]  Yugoslavia, you can go to Europe, the Eastern Bloc.  Everyone's in it.  Like, Madonna and everybody gets their HGH.  Yeah, yeah.  And like Richard Branson.  They go to the clubs.  Richard Branson.  There's a dude in the trench coat selling it.  Yeah.  The HGH is like a big thing in Europe.  That's why nobody's dying over there anymore.  We do.  I mean, we have a little bit of a skewed system over here, but that's the law.  And I think if people are going to make such a big deal out of it, especially bringing  these guys in front of Congress and having these hearings and spending taxpayer money on this  stuff, they're not doing anything about it.  They're letting the governing body, even in the case of the WWE, we sanction ourselves. 
[01:14:30]  It's a suspension, suspension, and termination.  So it's one of those things.  You're fired!  It's one of those things where if the government was so up in arms about it, they should get  involved from a legal standpoint.  And that's my two cents, Tim.  I like that strongman competition when those jacked up guys.  Ken Vetera.  Hurst the first to herkin-furkin.  Loves me some strongman.  You're ferkin-herkin strongman.  You like the strongman?  Take these ship anchors and roll them through the third story window.  And no one knows why. 
[01:15:00]  Why are we doing this?  Why don't we just bench like the combine?  How many times can you heft 225 pounds?  They're not going to be pulling...  I can do it once.  Pulling 767s with their teeth.  That's my max, gentlemen.  Stay right free, just like you guys.  Hold back a B-52 with your fingertip.  A 767, 100-yard dash.  Like, why?  Like, why?  Yeah, those guys are all jacked on some juice.  I stop and watch every fucking time, though. 
[01:15:30]  It's a great announcer.  It's like, oh, this guy's got everything it takes.  Yeah, he's fucking putting needles in his ass on the way down to the finish line.  You can see zits popping on his back as he's trying to push some fucking...  The fattest heartbeats, the zits pop themselves.  Tum-tum.  Tum-tum.  Tum-tum.  He's probably like a wet gremlin.  You definitely want to be first one in that heat. 
[01:16:00]  You ever see the one where they take the tractor tires?  Yeah.  Like, they're literally as high as the ceiling, and they've got to, like, knock them end over end.  Not roll them.  Making those phases.  Not roll them.  Yeah, there's one guy who just turn it sideways and roll the thing out of fucking hell.  What?  Done.  Five seconds.  Done.  You're on for me.  Face.  But, yo, you like the Red Bull, though?  Yeah.  They just laid down a Red Bull and a muscle milk right in front of me, and that's a pretty decent breakfast right there.  What is a muscle milk all about? 
[01:16:30]  It's just like a beer.  Donkey cum.  He's a man.  Standard meal replacement from the semen of jungle animals.  Find it at any drugstore.  You know how it is.  This typically is vanilla flavor.  Yeah.  It's frothy when you get into it.  Yeah.  Look at the size of Cena's hands.  My God.  I know.  You're a large guy.  Just crush him.  I shook your hand outside, and I was like, hi, Mr. Cena.  She turned into an instant bitch when you shake John Cena's hand. 
[01:17:00]  Hi, Mr. Cena.  Yeah.  So, guys, what else is up?  What's going on?  I don't know.  We just sit here on a daily basis and babble about things.  I want to hear more about the movie, though.  Who else is in it with you?  Who plays the villain?  The villain is Aiden Gillen, and he's known from, he was a corrupt mayor on The Wire,  the TV show.  I was available.  Yeah.  Oh, he was great.  He was getting a blowjob in one episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how Jimmy measures your IMDb page.  So, I mean, his greatness is obviously, yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Jimmy goes on IMDb.  Who got blown?  Looked like he threw muscle milk in someone's face.  That's the guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The fucking cop walks in and sees him getting blown with his big old mayor dick hanging out.  It was fucking great.  Good thing it wasn't Patterson.  She would have been sucking his finger.  But then again, he's a governor.  Yeah, well, well, whatever.  No, we're huge fans of The Wire, so.  Right on.  So right there, we got to see 12 rounds when it comes out Friday.  Right there, you're in it.  Brian White is my best friend.  He was in Stop the Yard, Mr. 3000.  He's been in a bunch of stuff.  It was directed by Renny Harlan, who did Die Hard 2. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, shit.  Cliff Hanger.  He's done a bunch of stuff.  So, I mean, we had a good cast, a good director, and we got a good movie, man.  Who's the girl?  Ashley Scott.  I don't know who she is.  She was, believe it or not, check this, Six Degrees of Separation, The Rocks Love Interest  in Walking Tall.  Oh, okay.  Yes, indeed.  Look at that, yeah, a little cross.  Oh, she's like, oh, fuck, I got to work with wrestlers again.  Another wrestler again.  Jesus.  Next, she's in Little Women 2 at The Undertaker.  Yeah.  The remake of Citizen Kane with Dusty Rhodes. 
[01:18:30]  With his lisp.  Rosebud.  He sounded like Pesci and JFK.  Cancer in the neck.  I've had it for years.  Bother me for years.  Cancer in the neck.  A wig.  Worst wig ever.  What a fucking weakness.  You're not a bad looking man, Mr. Gass.  Kevin Bagan was so good at that.  Yeah, he sure was until Madoff stole everything he had.  He's broke.  Poor guy.  He has to start over.  Fuck him.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Cena, we're all broke. 
[01:19:00]  Are you getting married?  Indeed I am.  There's rumors all over the internet.  Those are not rumors.  Those are truth.  Have you said it's true yet?  Are we making news today?  No, no.  I think a couple days ago I came out with the official comments.  How about you do it on our show?  Too late now.  We could use a little bump.  We're always late on the news.  We're late on everything.  We had what's-her-name in here, and the next day she admits that she had sex with A-Rod.  Yeah.  We're always a little late on the news.  His wife.  That's how late we are on the news.  Cynthia Rodriguez.  Kirsten Davis, right? 
[01:19:30]  Kirsten Davis.  Kirsten Davis.  The madam, yes.  Kirsten Davis, the madam.  She's on our show, and we're having a great interview, and the next day she tells everyone  she had sex with A-Rod.  Yeah.  How about you throw us a bone?  Yeah.  Let's work John a little bit.  Give us something that the internet will pick up on.  Come on.  A little something.  Who's your wife?  Where'd you meet her?  She's a high school sweetheart.  That's fantastic.  What do you do to high school?  I actually went to.  No, she's still going to high school.  She's still going to high school.  She's a sweetheart.  We've got to wait until the end of the year to actually do the game.  No, I've known her for a long time. 
[01:20:00]  We've known each other for about 12 years now.  Wow.  Where are you from, John?  I'm from West Newbury, Massachusetts.  It's like North Shore, just before you get to New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Yeah, right up there in the corner, basically.  Yeah, pretty much.  No accent.  Kind of lost that accent, though.  That's a good thing.  You get like an 18-pack of Pabst in me.  It'll come out.  Oh, every so often?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're one of those goddamn Sox fans?  I think by birthright.  Yeah.  You're born there.  You just never change, man.  You just never change.  You know what I love about Boston fans?  As soon as a player leaves your orbit, oh my God. 
[01:20:30]  It's revisionist history.  Like, that player was never worth their weight in the dog shit.  They sucked the whole time.  I've had, you remember Chappie, my friend Chappie?  Whatever.  He used to be a doorman at Knicks, and now he's a friend of, he used to be like,  J.J., Antoine Walker and fucking Paul Pierce are the best fucking forwards in NBA history.  These two fucking animals, they are fucking marvelous to watch.  And then Antoine Walker goes to Miami Heat, and he goes, Antoine Walker was a fucking slave, 
[01:21:00]  J.J.  He was a fucking fat bum.  All right, he does hoist three-pointers.  Fucking good riddance.  I named my daughter Johnny and my son Damon guy with a bracelet.  What would Johnny Damon do?  He's on the Yankees.  He had no fucking arm, Johnny Damon.  That fucking guy was a goddamn weakling in center field, fucking running around with  his fucking dreadlocks.  Hang on, dreadlocks?  Shut up.  He was a fucking queer.  That is too goddamn true.  I'm glad Curt Schilling retired. 
[01:21:30]  He was a fucking kid touch-out.  Fuck Curt Schilling and Johnny Damon in their ass.  Johnny Pesky would have fucking taken Curt Schilling deep.  The bloody sock was a farce.  It was a fucking bloody tampon fell out of his ass from getting fucking ass ripped from  that slave, Antoine Walker.  Jesus could leave the Red Sox.  They'd go, all you ever did was sacrifice.  Yeah.  Dirty Jew.  Oh my God.  That's brilliant. 
[01:22:00]  That's fucking brilliant.  Sacrifice.  All the time with the sacrifice.  Jesus.  I'll bat whenever you need me to bat.  Shanty Irish.  So, John, I want to talk a little bit about your match for the championship here.  Now, the big show, apparently, is trying to have some kind of relationship?  Yes.  With?  The general manager of SmackDown and the interim general manager of Raw, Vicky Guerrero.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, why is the third guy thrown in there? 
[01:22:30]  Because currently, Edge, the superstar, is not only the champion, but as far as our show  goes, he can play the guitar as well.  He is married to Vicky Guerrero.  So, there's a little problem there.  It's a bit of a love triangle.  So, where do you come in?  I'm actually just the guy who wants to be the champion.  Oh, so you kind of want to be, you would have fought him anyway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then the big show's got to be thrown in there.  Yeah.  Who sanctions a three-person championship match? 
[01:23:00]  Vicky Guerrero.  Really?  Yes.  She's allowed to do that?  She's the general manager.  Went right over everyone.  She can just make decisions.  She's the head muckety-muck now?  Yeah.  Well, there's been some McMahon tragedies on the show.  Well, yeah.  I've seen the McMahon tragedies.  We want to get into that for a minute or two.  Yeah, we want to talk a little bit about that.  That's fine.  Get this message back to Vince for us.  Every six months or so, Vince comes out, starts yelling at somebody, and then just gets laid  out.  And then see you bye.  And he's gone for six more months.  He comes back for a day. 
[01:23:30]  What is Vince doing?  He's, I guess he's building up his comeback for about six months and then making one great  day of it.  Is that what it is?  Now, what kind of plastic surgery is he doing?  We're thinking maybe a little cosmetic surgery.  He needs some time off.  No, no, no.  He's at TV every week.  Every week?  Yeah.  I mean, these guys are running the show.  The family runs the show.  Hospital bed?  Because I know he was very injured that last time.  Of course.  Of course.  But I mean, this is from the WWE, the entertainment part of it.  It's episodic television, guys. 
[01:24:00]  What?  If I'm the first one that has to sit here, we can be breaking news here on Opie and Anthony.  I may have to tell you that wrestling is indeed entertainment.  And we also may have to have a conversation about Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny as well.  It's not me that's going to have a problem.  It's young Sam.  If he hears that.  But Santa never did steroids.  He'll be crushed.  Well, you never know.  Santa was pretty buff for a while.  He made those rounds every Christmas Eve, man.  That's a lot of ground to come.  He was on the Black Beauties to get around all night.  Did he look like Mr. Magoo when he went in front of Congress, like Mark McGuire did?  Oh, my goodness.  Jesus Christ.  The guy's all jacked up. 
[01:24:30]  The guy's jacked up, smashing balls into parking lots from Major League Stadiums.  And then he said in front of Congress, oh, Magoo, you've done it again.  He's got his little spectacles on.  His tiny little accounting glasses.  His arms are like twigs.  Jim Rome said he looked like Ronald McDonald.  Called him Mark McDonald.  That is fresh.  Mark McDonald.  What's that about?  And now he's a golfer.  That's good.  Playing golf balls.  He's playing golf. 
[01:25:00]  What happened?  He's a good golfer.  I wonder what his drive is.  Yeah, now?  What if he can still hit it big?  Yeah.  That's a good question.  How big are going on?  Probably not.  So do you win WrestleMania?  Let's get it on the table.  I'd like to say that I'm going to win.  You do.  If you're asking me, I'm going to win.  He's nodding to me.  So let's have the wrestling size pick that up.  Let me tell you something.  Can I bet on this?  Is there a bookie maybe that can take the action?  I saw Andre the Giant, who's the last man standing, Sabotor Belomo, and him clearly  added it right.  It fucking sucks. 
[01:25:30]  Indeed.  That's Boston Talk Radio right there.  That's exactly how it is.  Every time anyone leaves, they were...  Billy Guerin was a bum, JJ.  What did he ever do?  Noma, Manny, Pedro.  Oh, Manny, yeah.  Noma has hips of a woman.  He had an operation.  Noma had an operation where they put in woman hips.  Oh, Christ.  When does Father's 2 open?  I need a cartel.  Error, error, error. 
[01:26:00]  So, here's the deal, guys.  I got no news besides the movie and besides WrestleMania.  The movie's big news, though.  Yeah, the movie is big news, but like personal nuggets, you know, I...  Yeah.  Are you trying to leave?  No, no.  I'm just maybe...  Oh, all right.  What's it about?  What are you holding him captive?  Yes.  I know.  You guys keep feeding me Red Bull and Muscle Milk.  I'll stay all day.  We had Kurt Angle in here yesterday.  Yeah, you were talking about that out of studio. 
[01:26:30]  That guy was a dick.  Our old friend Kurt Angle.  Jesus, Jay.  You didn't like him?  No, not at all.  Well, I thought he was nice.  What happened, Jay?  The whole fucking thing that happened?  What thing?  Okay, what happened?  What happened?  Pinned me down.  He farted in my face.  No, I wasn't here.  You guys were like, what the fuck?  Don't you guys work here?  Did you notice I was not here?  Well, I thought maybe you heard something after...  Yeah, you know.  I'm very gullible.  Kurt Angle had no arm.  Well, he did leave the WWE, so, you know, now...  He did.  Yeah.  Great.  Now he's wrestling in backyards in Saugus. 
[01:27:00]  He's out to Kowloon.  Saugerville.  He's out to Kowloon with Voss and Bobby.  Bobby.  Those two could carry that room.  Damn.  Yeah, we wish Kurt nothing but the best.  Yeah, yeah.  You watching any sitcoms these days, Kurt?  He had the great Jay Moore.  What's that?  John Cena.  Hold on, Kurt.  Oh, because we were just talking about Kurt.  Of course.  I could have fallen asleep last night.  Every TV show on TLC, no one can have fucking two kids anymore. 
[01:27:30]  Everyone's got quintuplets, five sets of twins, there's Mormons with 95...  I had 19 kids.  They all came out of my tunnel of a pussy.  Like, the TLC channel after 11 o'clock is just...  Who can have the most freaky fucking kids running around?  And you go, this is true, I just couldn't sleep.  My wife's got the flu, she's awake flopping around.  And then I look at the TV and I'm like, I've got to go to bed.  And they go, coming up next, primordial dwarfs.  So I kind of just came straight from those freaks to here.  Yeah, you got to.  You certainly got to. 
[01:28:00]  Hence my nice bed haircut.  I see that.  I didn't want to mention it.  They put the best shit on, and we got these outrageous hours.  There was that I Survived show that came on, and there was a woman, she's out in the middle  of the ocean on a fish processing vessel, and there's this big hopper with an auger at  the bottom of it that apparently had to be cleaned.  So the power gets shut off, she crawls down in there, and she's cleaning it, and they're  in a storm, so there's like, the thing is really rocking. 
[01:28:30]  A guy falls into the control panel, hits the on button, both her legs go through the  auger, up to her knees.  And they got to cut her out of this thing with torches, she's bleeding to death.  Did you see the chick that got eaten by the shark swimming between the two party boats?  Oh yeah, that's a classic video.  Oh yeah.  That's a good one.  Did you see her legs go night-night?  Oh, night-night-night.  She survived that.  Did you see it?  Yikes.  Her legs go night-night.  She's just like, everyone, it's like two cruise ships, and they meet up in the middle 
[01:29:00]  of like the Aegean Sea, and they're like, everyone in the water, we got 11 minutes, you  know, tightly wound cruise ship.  We got 11 minutes, and then it's back to the party pit.  Enjoy yourselves.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Everybody out of the Blancla buffet, up on the promenade.  And this chick's swimming, and they're like, Marsha, look out!  And you just see like this giant shark coming up behind.  It's like a shadow.  It's huge.  Is that the girl that gets the leg ripped off?  Both of them, yeah.  She survived.  They pull her out of the water, and you see where the leg was.  Oh, yeah, it's awful.  It's amazing.  This is exactly the kind of movie I like to go see. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, it's a good ride, man.  It's a good action flick.  That's why I go to the movies.  If I want to see something like Revolutionary Road, I'll stay in my house, and I'll watch  it on like DVD.  That was a great movie.  That DiCaprio was so good.  It stunk.  They hated it more than anything.  Jimmy does that constantly.  It was horrendous.  Fantastic.  He was wonderful.  I hated him.  It was horrendously depressing.  Mark Cohen used to do the best, like upstairs at the Olive Tree, be like, you know, the  guy that has a big opinion, and you disagree with him, he changes his mind for that second. 
[01:30:00]  So you used to disagree, like, oh my gosh, we ate it or so.  The food was so good there.  We loved it.  Did you ever know that?  I thought it stunk.  I didn't like the sauce, though.  But he doesn't really like it.  He can't hurt.  With his stupid face.  He's funny.  He is funny and hairy.  Yeah, really.  Fucking Juan Epstein headed nothing.  You know, once Mark Cohen stayed at my apartment, and before he left, he had to buy new sheets  because so much of his back hair.  Oh! 
[01:30:30]  He was in my sheets.  He was a very hairy Jewish man who killed my Lord and Savior.  Yes, he did.  Jay is, uh...  Allegedly.  Are you converting Jay?  Yeah.  Is that public knowledge?  I'm writing a book about it, too.  Are you?  Yeah.  About conversion?  A priest in a comic walking into a bar.  Oh, really?  My priest is 30 years old, and he surfs every day.  Any locs every day.  Any dogs every...  No, he doesn't do that.  He's become a Catholic there, John.  What do you want to become a Catholic for?  I love it.  Anything in particular?  I love the structure.  Really?  I love everything about it. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah?  I love the church I went into for the first time.  St. Monica's and Santa Monica.  They are nice churches.  You gotta give them that.  I just felt like I was at home.  It was great.  Really?  And...  You don't come across as a religious man, are you, Mr. Grady?  I just liked it.  I liked the structure.  I like...  I like...  You know.  It was one dangling participle.  I like affairs.  I don't...  I like going to a fair, but I don't want to be a carny.  You know what I mean?  I like...  You could go to...  This is a church.  St. Monica's is really progressive, too.  And I didn't realize how inclusive the Catholic Church was compared to my perception of it 
[01:31:30]  growing up.  Really?  Maybe they've just...  Not if you're gay.  Well, not...  You go to St. Monica's.  If there's a gay and lesbian, stations are the cross mass.  How the hell does that work?  Because they're a progressive Catholic Church.  But you can't be...  See, the rules are the rules, I think.  The rules are the rules.  I think once the rules are laid out, that's how it's supposed to be.  The rules are...  There ain't no rules.  Oh, wow.  And tonight we're racing for pinks.  The rules are...  The pinks.  They believe that you're made exactly the way you are, and there's absolutely nothing wrong 
[01:32:00]  with you.  It would just make you better.  I'm just as God made me.  Exactly.  What's that from?  St. Monica.  Spinal Tap.  Oh, okay.  The desk clerk.  That's good.  Yeah.  He's bounding down.  It's gone now?  He's bounding down.  Ruled.  Honey, I love you.  It's done?  She dressed like a fucking dick.  Well, I think I only got six episodes.  Oh, that's it?  Then they'll see.  How about the hilarious body double for that girl's tits in the first season?  Thank you!  She's like kind of a pudgy patty.  Thank you!  And she's got like brown arms and like a smoker's face, and she's just kind of like...  Nah, look!  She takes her tits out. 
[01:32:30]  It's like something out of fucking porkies.  It's the most amazing set of tits ever.  We talked about this yesterday, Jay.  Put the picture up.  Because she has a little...  Her arms a little chunky.  Yeah, my wife ran for that.  Yeah?  She didn't get it, but...  And then they went large, apparently.  We actually...  Oh, man.  We actually mentioned this yesterday, and someone said, Jay, and I hate to bring up a bad memory,  they said that an ex of yours might have been in True Lies as a body double.  I don't want to talk...  Okay.  I don't know.  Who are you talking about?  I made her a millionaire.  What else do you want? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know the sex.  I don't know what she does.  You ever write a check with two commas open?  No.  Then go fuck yourself.  We'll talk about...  And I'll think of things to talk to you about.  It's not fun.  No.  I didn't write one check.  I spread it out.  You spread it out like a dope.  I could keep the misery going for a while.  You better off living in a box.  But it was Dominic Barber's idea.  You two should share in your success.  Shut up.  Shut up.  There you go, Jay.  Look at those.  Yeah, those are not hers. 
[01:33:30]  That's definitely not hers.  Is that you?  Who's got the clicker there?  That's Danny.  Danny, this quick.  He's good.  Danny's circling the areola.  Yeah, he's...  It's very nice, but look at the belly.  It's not hers, because she's a bit...  She's not heavy, but...  I mean, she's not a fat girl.  She ain't fat.  She's going to be...  After that show ends, she's going to be huge.  She's keeping that weight down for that show.  Who else was I just watching on TV that I was like,  oh, this person...  Oh, one of the Kardashian girls is going to be a fucking house,  and I can't wait.  The one that looks like China. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  She kind of looks like China.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah?  I'm more of a fan of Kourtney.  I would disagree.  Kim, I think, is actually really pretty.  I think it's a shame she dresses up like that  and has sex with all her colors.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  That's my Boston guy.  Back to Boston talking.  Wow.  We have to get John Cena out.  I'm getting a note.  When was the premiere?  Believe it or not, there is no premiere.  We're just releasing it.  What the fuck is...  Ow.  We're just releasing it.  We're just bringing it out.  That's like old school.  That's like a KRS-1 album. 
[01:34:30]  You don't give a shit.  Just bring it out.  Underground, son.  Just bring it out.  Man, underground, the RZA.  Underground, kid.  Bootang, forever, 12 rounds.  Yeah, that's my RZA impression.  Wait, we've got to get Dean Edwards on today for the Tracy Morgan showdown.  Yes, we should.  But does he have his number?  I might have Dean's contact info.  I'm not sure.  Let's get him on for the big showdown.  He's under, who can I get to open for me in a pinch?  Oh, shit.  Your cell phone.  That's right.  I got Burt Kreischer and Segura on mine.  Burt Kreischer.  Jesus. 
[01:35:00]  Did you wrestle in college?  No, I played football.  What college?  Springfield College.  Springfield Mass.  Springfield Mass.  He was a wicked corner.  Cover corner.  Not afraid to stuff to run.  John Cena, I'll pull up against any goddamn running back you throw at me.  I don't care.  Bring your Roxbury fullback across the end.  And I swear to God, I'll put the goddamn two back through the one-hole.  I'm no John Cena loves Tracy Morgan. 
[01:35:30]  Because I love wrestling.  I am a wrestler.  John Cena's my uncle.  You know, John, let me give you a lesson in comedy.  If you can make eight people in bleachers that want to see Morning Radio Live laugh, kill  yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  Jesus Christ.  What is this, Alice in San Francisco?  I always feel like I'm bombing on that show.  Because they suck.  They're fucking assholes.  You don't like them?  No, I think she's a fucking cunt.  Don't be fresh.  They always act like there's something like, why are you still mad at us? 
[01:36:00]  It's like, every time I walk in, I got a fucking ten minutes.  I'm like, just sell some tickets.  I'm hearing this.  Christ.  I'm tired.  I'm talking and kissing over here right away.  He's getting fucking fresh.  He's getting fresh right away.  Right away.  Billy, you got a little out of line yourself.  So we have, John has to go.  Do we have, Ray Liot is on his way.  Is he here or no?  That was all the money we had, Karen.  Is he going to be annoyed by the Ray Liot?  Oh my God, I hope not.  Oh, you know him?  I'm a very fancy man.  Oh.  That's very nice.  Well.  We live near each other in the Pacific region. 
[01:36:30]  I met Ray one time.  I was about to say, a very specific neighborhood where people can walk up and down like creeps.  Street.  I met Ray one time, and I bet you he doesn't remember me.  Of course not.  He'll remember you.  You're very memorable.  We'll ask him.  That's going to be the first question.  Did you touch his arm and go, Ray, can I have a picture?  No.  I just kept going, you're stuttering, prick, yeah, until he walked out.  Because he loves that.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  Oh, he must love the Goodfellas references.  The bones, he shot him in the foot.  I don't know why I'm a good shot.  You know, Cena was the one that was bumped for Obama. 
[01:37:00]  Indeed.  Got booted for the president.  Oh, that's right.  That was your spot.  Got booted for the president.  That was your spot.  Barack Obama.  Oh, Jesus.  He always hit for power.  Never hit for average.  You got bumped.  I don't even think people got bumped anymore from the Tonight Show.  For Obama?  Bumped for the president, yeah.  That was a good week, too.  Yeah.  Oh, well, who else was on that week?  Let's see.  Jimmy Norton.  No, I didn't watch.  Did you get bumped?  I did.  Oh, why wouldn't I?  You were on.  Obama wanted Monday, but I couldn't reschedule, so they gave him Thursday. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, Jimmy was on Monday.  Obama was on Thursday.  You haven't seen him?  I have to be here.  Tell the president.  Let's get you on.  I don't know.  Where are you going next?  I don't know.  People listening, they may be able to follow you around.  It's certainly not anything as valuable as this.  And I do thank you guys for the time.  Special moment.  Thanks for asking me back.  I mean, this is...  No problem.  You don't have the same publicist as Taylor Hicks, do you?  No.  All right.  Is there a Taylor Hicks incident I should know about?  Yeah, I had a big run-in with her.  That was one of them. 
[01:38:00]  Can we play that?  Sure.  Find Jay Morgan.  Well, he's really got to go, because now they're scraping the finish.  I got to pee anyway.  He's probably going to be there next.  Oh, Chit Chat.  Chit Chat is on.  Well, Chit Chat.  It's the big one.  It's going to be tough.  I'm going to try to get John out of here.  Guys, thanks so much.  Thank you, John.  I got to pee.  Thanks for being in here.  There's no easy way to do this with Jaycee.  No, I know.  Just get up.  I'm sorry.  No, it's good.  I like it.  Thanks, John.  John Cena, everyone.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, somebody, I refuse to add friends on PS3, because I don't have friends in real  life, so why would I have friends online?  Well, that's the only reason to have them online.  But I acknowledge that you guys are, like, you know, giving me messages and stuff.  Yours went away, because I was going to add you, Danny, finally.  That's all right.  Hello, exactly, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Could you send me another, because I'll add you.  Actually, I had a question for you.  I was wondering if you had a chance to check out PlayStation Home at all. 
[01:39:00]  Why are you laughing?  Because there's a little funny thing I like to do with PlayStation Home.  That's why I was wondering if you know what it is.  What is PlayStation Home?  It's kind of like, it's like an online community.  I mean, if you're more of an Xbox person, think of, like, you have your avatars, but now  all your avatars can meet up in a central location and, like, hang out with each other.  Almost like The Sims meets, like, Second Life sort of a thing.  I have no desire to do any of that stuff.  Did you make your avatar?  Did you make an avatar?  Well, I did.  I mean, in order to...  I know, I saw yours and stuff. 
[01:39:30]  Did Oat make one?  Did you make an avatar of yourself?  No.  No, I'm a black guy.  Because Travis's is really good.  What, what, what's...  Well, on...  Fans looks just like a fan.  Oh, yeah.  Well, on Xbox Live, I mean, you can make your guy, you know...  I mean, it's not, like, as intense as some of the create-your-own-player stuff that  EA is doing, but, I mean, it's good enough, and you can get to the point where you look  like your guy.  Right.  And Travis is actually really, really good.  Yeah.  My guy sucks.  Well, let me see pictures.  My guy sucks.  So, what about this home thing?  Well, it's just a lot of fun to play with, I guess. 
[01:40:00]  Like, I don't understand what the purpose of it is, per se, but, like...  Yeah, you can play games.  Why would you just sit around and...  Yeah, like, why am I going to, like, decorate my digital house with, like, shitty furniture?  Yeah, I know.  That doesn't make sense.  Really?  But there's all these kids that are on it, and, like, their avatars are there, and they  can see what you're doing just as you can see what they're doing, so I have this  new favorite bit of mine where I just like to...  That's right.  Because...  And there's, like, pre...  Uh-oh.  There's, like, pre...  This must be really bad.  No, it's not.  It really isn't.  He's really taking his time getting there.  It's just, but, you know, if you don't have a keypad, like, there's already pre-written 
[01:40:30]  things that you could say to introduce yourself to other gamers in this little virtual world.  Right.  So, I decided that one of my favorite things to do is I load up PlayStation Home, and I go  into, like, one of the main meeting places, and I just try to find, like...  Well, first, what I did was I was finding any chick that was around, or even...  Who knows?  Maybe it wasn't really.  It was some guy.  But I would run up, and I would just constantly ask, because there's a pre-loaded question  that says, where are you from?  And I just...  I just...  Non-stop, over and over again, I don't even give them a chance to answer.  I just ask, where are they from? 
[01:41:00]  Where are they from?  Where are they from?  And there's all these different actions that you can make your character do, and there  are some dances that are in there, so...  As I'm asking, where are you from?  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  I'm just...  My character is just dancing.  He's right in front of the person, just dancing like a retard.  Until they run away.  It's like the...  It's like that South Park World of Warcraft episode.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  One of the best ever.  You know what?  And now all I can't...  The only thing I can do with myself in PlayStation Home is just bother people.  Just fuck people, yeah.  Like, there's a bowling alley where you can go and bowl, but the thing is, it's a little 
[01:41:30]  too real, because if the bowling alley is full, you can't play, and you have to wait  for people to...  What the hell is that?  Don't wait.  So, I went up to a group of people at the bowling alley, and I told them that the manager  said they all had to go.  And then when they called me stupid or an idiot, I just asked them if they wanted to  see my boner and started dancing.  You know what?  It's so childish and immature.  Yeah, it is.  But it's really quickly becoming my new favorite thing to do. 
[01:42:00]  You're hysterically funny.  You might have gotten me hooked.  You got to try PlayStation Home later.  I might have to try this now.  That is so funny.  It was funny, because I was trying to tell this to Travis, and he kind of went with it,  but he didn't really know what I was talking about, and he came over to my house over  the weekend, and I was showered up, but he jumped on board immediately.  It's definitely a fun bit.  I'm going to take my time adding friends, and I'm going to start with you, Danny.  I will send you another one, yeah.  Blue Heeler, I think I might add you, so why don't you send yours again?  I think I'm going to add one a week. 
[01:42:30]  One a week?  Yeah, just one a week.  Take my time.  I want to really, you know...  And you got to write something.  Don't just write, add a friend.  I just was, accept, accept, accept, accept, accept.  No, no, no, no.  And then, bing, bing, bing, I got friends are on.  No, no.  And someone was turning me on to the new Luminous game.  Is it good?  Did you check it out?  Was it you?  No, it wasn't.  I was really heavy into the first one, and then they came out with the second one.  Yeah.  And it was like, whatever.  They got it for the PS3, though.  I got nice speakers. 
[01:43:00]  I'm thinking this could be good.  Yeah, I downloaded their offering.  Buttery Beats, my friends.  Let's not forget the Buttery Beats.  Their offering on Xbox Live was all right.  Buttery Beats are awful, though.  Buttery.  I'm a huge fan.  Oh, that's a...  Yeah, hello, exactly.  You look like Howard.  That's me.  I know, everybody says that.  Well, they don't have...  Pop me up.  Can you pop me up?  Do I have a...  Wait, there's no option for Jufro, so I had to go with that.  Jufro?  Yeah, you kind of look like Howard on yours.  I think I did a fine job on myself. 
[01:43:30]  You look good.  This is for the Xbox.  I have my, um...  Yes, my little hat and my shirt, T-shirt, and some cami pants.  Yeah.  And even 5'11 by 5'11 boots.  How the fuck do you...  Look.  I see that.  How the fuck do you do that?  You want to see Eric?  Yeah, let's see E-Rock.  Jesus.  That's not E-Rock.  Ah, come on.  What a lying sack of fuck.  He's one of those fat chicks that go online and make themselves look hot.  This is the first time I've ever seen this because... 
[01:44:00]  I shouldn't say hot, because now...  But you know what I'm saying.  That's not E-Rock.  E-Rock is a liar.  It's the first time I've seen that because Eric's not one of my friends on Xbox.  Yeah, I've never seen that.  Really?  Holy shit, he's not my friend either.  Get E-Rock in here.  That's Dan.  Look at the fans.  That's Dan's looks pretty good.  Yeah, but Travis, yours is definitely the best.  You really do look like you.  It's kind of sick.  Yeah, where's Travis?  I know this is pretty good.  More visual bits from your favorite radio pals, but...  Holy shit. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, it is pretty good.  That's pretty good, man.  Get E-Rock in here.  Who's he kidding?  E-Rock, what the fuck was he thinking when he made himself...  Put E-Rock's picture back up there.  Yeah.  Bob.  Oh, Bob.  Bob Kelly.  Steve, because Steve shaved his head, too.  Hey, E-Rock.  E-Rock, come on.  We gotta force you to change your avatar and make yourself fat.  Look at your avatar.  Yeah, also...  Dude, you're thinner than Sam.  Exactly.  There's a...  Well, it should be a reotard.  The one up in the corner, you have this camera device thing that you take the photo. 
[01:45:00]  For some reason, my guy decided to dance, so I caught him in, like, mid-dancing thing.  Don't try to change the subject, but you made yourself real skinny.  Yeah.  Why didn't you puff yourself up?  You look like Rick.  You know what?  No, you know what?  It's even...  No, there's something else going on with E-Rock.  He secretly wants to be the next Ryan Seacrest.  Oh, yeah.  Look, it does kind of look like Ryan Seacrest.  He's got a little Ryan Seacrest look to it.  You want to be the next, like, Ryan Seacrest, top 40, get a million gigs type of guy in  this business, right? 
[01:45:30]  With money, sure.  See, he's not gonna deny it.  I always knew it, too.  All right, I'll alter it when I get home.  Bring it in tomorrow, and I want it a bit accurate.  You gotta get the pelican neck in there.  Is there a pelican neck option for the avatar?  Can you draw the chin down?  And then he looks while you're making it and gives the thumbs up, like, yeah.  Are you all right, E-Rock?  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  All right, I'll fix it when I get home.  You did this to yourself because you said that, you know, you met your quota today.  I'm like, no fucking way.  You challenged us to bring in some more jokes.  Some jokes.  All right.  So, why were we talking about PS3?  Oh, Luminous.  Eh, whatever.  What game are you playing these days, Ant?  I am playing Call of Duty 5 on PC, though.  Yeah.  I have opted to not play it any longer on the Xbox because I suck a fat dick with the controller. 
[01:46:30]  I was on PC.  I was on PC owning.  Yeah.  Fucking owning.  My favoritest thing to do now is run around with Molotov cocktails, throw them at people,  and while they're on fire, I shoot them.  Really?  Oh, it's classic.  I, like, maxed out all of my challenges for the Molotov cocktails because I can't get  enough.  I just light them up and start throwing them at people.  Oh, it upsets them so much when they're on fire. 
[01:47:00]  Much cooler to just lay back on your couch with the controller, a little Xbox, or PS3.  I have a comfy office chair now.  I lean back in it.  Yeah, but you gotta use the mouse.  They don't have that figured out where you can be just sitting on your couch.  Mouse keyboard kills a fucking controller.  Kills it.  As far as comfort?  As far as, uh...  As far as just relaxing in your house, going, I'm gonna play some video games?  I've never had my fingers and hands ache after playing with a keyboard and mouse.  I'll tell you that much.  And I could zero in on somebody and get headshots and stuff with a mouse so much easier than that 
[01:47:30]  god fucking controller.  Right.  It's just the way it is.  Sorry.  That's why you don't use a controller when you're at work on your computer.  Because it's easier with a mouse and keyboard.  Uh, we're gonna go backwards just to...  Uh, Danny, thank you.  Yes.  We have an Xbox 360 here.  We want E-Rock to redo his avatar as we do our radio show. 
[01:48:00]  Right now.  And we'll help him along.  We'll be fair.  But he has to fatten up his character.  Yeah.  Pelican neck.  In the pelican neck.  They sell an Xbox keyboard, somebody's saying.  Yeah.  What's that about?  Oh, it's a keyboard.  I actually got one.  Oh, yeah.  Danny got me one.  And, um, it delayed too much.  Oh, really?  Like, clipped.  Yeah.  Huh.  I've seen avatars of Jimmy that are pretty good, too.  There's a few Jimmys out there.  Are there? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, there's a, uh, like, Frunkus and Jimmy, little Jimmy and things like that.  And it's little Jimmy Nortons running around.  Aw.  It's pretty good.  That's very nice.  They must be adorable.  Oh, they are.  They're like little cherubs.  Hey, we're on, we're on to something with this PS home, though, and the avatars.  We got Brian in Rhode Island.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Brian.  Hey, uh, my favorite thing to do on, uh, on the home is someone else will be sitting  down, like, in the middle of the park or something.  I'll run up in front of them and then hit the rave, uh, dance button, and then it'll 
[01:49:00]  look like I'm humping their face.  All right, later.  Yeah, that's, that's good.  Let's go to Matt in Washington.  Matt?  Hey, fellas, what's up?  What's up, Matt?  Hey, um, I don't know if you guys saw the, the Dateline or 2020, whatever it is, but there,  there's a study by the American Psychological Association on fatties and uglies who literally 
[01:49:30]  build self-confidence through their avatars or online characters.  Oh, that's right.  Well, we're going to knock down Erocs.  Oh, boy, are we.  Terrible.  Yeah, they, they show, um, I've seen avatars of people in games where then you see them,  uh, maybe get married in game and then they show them at a convention or something and they  are just messes and they are these, oh, you just say, what the fuck, well, who am I? 
[01:50:00]  What did you say, sir?  Who's show?  They interrupted you.  Sorry, buddy.  What'd you say?  Who's, who's not confident?  Huh?  Who's not confident?  You're saying someone's not confident?  They're not confident, Jimmy.  No.  I'm telling you, the fatties and the uglies don't know.  I know.  You told us that already.  We heard it.  I was trying to add something else.  You stepped all over me.  All right.  Thanks, Matt.  Yeah.  Don't suck it.  You know, there should be a website out there.  Maybe there is.  I don't know.  There seems to be a website for everything.  Where you take the avatar and the actual person in a split screen.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:50:30]  There are.  That would rule.  But the ones that obviously don't match up whatsoever.  Yeah.  There are people that actually post on, like, World of Warcraft websites and EverQuest websites.  And they have threads that are, like, real, you know, real pics.  Yeah.  And they show themselves as real people.  And you look at their avatar and you're like, whoa.  Yeah.  What the hell's going on there?  You know what game E-Rock's trying to turn me on to?  What?  Mario Kart for the Wii.  What?  And I played it.  He's playing children's games. 
[01:51:00]  I played it.  He brought it over and I played it.  And I think I did five or six races.  And I was like, ah, that's kind of cool.  And then I was done.  Yeah.  I can't.  I'm not going to get turned on to this game.  Maybe play it every once in a while like you're in an arcade.  But he takes it seriously and he gets pissed off the Asians because I guess he can't beat the Asians.  Really?  Is he playing Lego Star Wars or Lego Indiana Jones?  You saw the Mario.  Yeah, he is.  No shit.  He's playing Lego.  I fucking hated that fucking cartoon Mario Brothers shit. 
[01:51:30]  It was.  But loodoo.  But loodoo.  Oh, look.  I drove through the circle.  It's floating.  But loodoo.  Mwah, mwah.  Mwah, mwah.  Mwah.  Oh, quick.  Be a bullet.  Oh, when you get the bullet, though, that's cool.  It's not cool.  You fly by everybody and you're almost indestructible.  That fucking television graphics from 1988.  Yeah.  You fucking stunk. 
[01:52:00]  Well, you look at the wheels and you're like, wait a minute.  It doesn't really look like the wheels are actually rolling on the virtual reality ground.  It actually yells, vroom, vroom.  I liked playing it.  I wouldn't get hooked on it.  That fucking stinks.  You've been trying to talk about this Lego crap and I'm just not in.  Lego Indiana Jones.  Explain.  Star Wars Saga.  This is the Lego edition.  The Lego edition.  Yeah.  Why the Lego edition?  I can understand young children playing this. 
[01:52:30]  It's a lot of fun.  I didn't think it would be.  Explain why the Star Wars Lego game is a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Please.  You're Jedi's.  You're going around.  You're hacking people up and when you hack them, they fall into little Lego pieces.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be better if they hack them and they come in half and maybe bleed?  Like, isn't that what I kind of like video games because of that, because that's like  fun to watch violence and stuff because you can't do that in real life.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  But this is fun, too.  Lego.  Yeah.  Lego is synonymous with child.  So?  What are you doing?  Try it.  It's good.  I would not even fucking try that.  I heard the Indiana Jones ones is even better.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  Whoa.  I ask again, what makes it cool?  It's just a lot of fun to play.  Yeah.  But why is it a lot of fun?  Well, the game control's really good and you're playing the whole Star Wars saga as  Lego features.  There are so many Star Wars games out there that are more realistic than Lego people. 
[01:53:30]  Sometimes you don't want to play realistic.  Yes, you do.  You don't play anything.  Yeah, because that fucking, that cartoon shit made me nuts.  He's driving a car.  It was like an old time race car with the big man and the small car driving through floating  squares.  Believe you.  Oh, look.  The jingling of change.  While we were playing, Jim kept yelling, why is there a monster riding a bike?  I fucking hated that bike. 
[01:54:00]  Don't ask questions.  Just enjoy.  Why is there a monster riding a bike?  A monster.  Put a fucking guy on it.  Ooh, it's the gargoyle monster.  Ugh.  Do you play any video games, Jim?  None.  None.  None.  None.  Wait, which was the one you, uh, Asteroids, was it?  Well, yeah.  You loved the Asteroids.  I was very, I was, I set a record when I was a kid.  All right.  I didn't set a record, but I was in the paper.  Well, it was in the paper.  It was close.  What was the, uh, the last video game you were into?  For real.  I'll tell you.  Asteroids.  It ended with Asteroids. 
[01:54:30]  Of course it did.  It pretty much started and ended with Asteroids.  Yeah.  I tried the Xbox fucking, uh, GTA because we're in it.  You got excited about that game for a little bit.  Yeah, I kept backing it into a fence.  I haven't played it since.  Yeah, Jimmy couldn't get out of the parking lot.  I couldn't get out of the parking lot.  It was horrible.  Of Grand Theft Auto.  Yes.  Yeah?  Nothing?  No.  I don't play any of them.  No.  What about the Guitar Hero?  No, I don't play that either.  My favorite video game is Quickly Erase History on HotMovies.com, so nobody can see what I  really like to watch when I'm alone. 
[01:55:00]  Guitar Hero is a phenomenon, and it's the most simplest game to program.  I've been telling you, there's nothing to this game.  Oh, yeah?  No, it's, I mean, there's skill involved, but imagine the programmer.  No.  It's so easy.  Piece of cake.  You're just matching up, you know what I'm trying to say?  If you're thinking like a programmer.  Yeah.  It's not that involved.  You're hitting the keyboard at the exact time that you're supposed to hit it.  That's it.  That's all they have to figure out.  Yeah, it's like Simon Says almost, or something like that. 
[01:55:30]  It's an involved Simon Says.  You're absolutely right.  But this game is all the rage.  Danny owns on that.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  He puts on an expert.  No, he doesn't.  And you just watch.  No.  You kicked the piss out of everyone.  We set it up and you failed.  Yeah, but I got to the bottom of why.  And he choked in front of Slash.  I got to the bottom of why that happened.  Because we had the video, we had everything hooked up to the video server, and the audio  was going directly into the board, and that created a delay. 
[01:56:00]  A delay.  Between audio and video.  You can't have a delay.  You cannot have a delay playing that game.  But you're never going to have the chance to show off in front of Slash again.  I know.  Brewer.  Brewer.  Which is why I get to tell the story over and over again.  You looked so bad in front of Slash, dude.  Slash was here, and he's like, Slash is like, guitar hero, cool.  And we got Slash doing a little guitar hero, and Danny's like, let me show you what I  can do.  Plank, plank, plank, plank, plank.  Wow.  Because there was a slight delay between what he was hearing and what he was seeing, and  you can't have that on Guitar Hero.  No.  Because I'm trying to... 
[01:56:30]  What was Slash doing?  Was he knocking it out?  Vomiting and laughing.  Fuck.  No.  He was telling me that he could barely hang on, like,  medium, and I thought, like, the funny, you know, like, the irony with that, I'd start  playing on Expert and just, like, trying to, like, be like, yeah, look how good I am  in front of Slash.  Like, you know, obviously it's retarded.  He was panicking and sweating, like, oh, wait, wait, maybe I need to warm up a little  bit.  You do, too.  Let me warm up with two first.  On Christmas Eve, Danny was over the house, we had it, and Danny was shredding.  Yeah? 
[01:57:00]  Shredding.  I'm an expert.  And I beat the piss out of the drums, and I broke the drumstick.  Yeah, he broke the drumstick.  How are you doing, Rock Band?  He broke it.  And, well, no, the new guitar hero has drums, too.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, with cymbals and everything.  And then he's talking smack to Keith.  Like, how old is she?  She's, like, five.  She's the cutest.  Five-year-old daughter.  He's talking smack.  We're playing together.  We're not even, like, versus each other.  We're just playing together, and then, like, the song's over, and she goes, I won.  And I said, no, I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.  She's like, I did better than you. 
[01:57:30]  I said, no, you didn't.  No, and Danny's just like, I'm better than you.  You're really bad at this.  You're supposed to let the kid think Danny's on.  Danny goes, it's his new bit, be brutally honest with children.  That's Danny's new bit.  Wow.  So he's brutally honest with these little kids, and then the kid says, I hate your friend.  She was just getting so frustrated with the fact that I just would not let her have her  little moments.  That was great.  He's such a prick.  Unbelievable.  Can you set up Guitar Hero today? 
[01:58:00]  Oh, man.  How about tomorrow?  Yeah, definitely tomorrow.  We'll give you another chance at it.  Definitely tomorrow.  Because I actually want to see somebody rock the edge.  Absolutely.  I'll go home and practice.  I'm so bored.  I'm so bored.  The leads.  I'm so bored seeing the little kids do a slow ride.  I'm like, all right.  No.  Well, I want to see some shit now.  I was in some of the stores, you know, during the big Christmas rush, and, like, you know,  there's always a crowd around, and it's just like, you know what?  I could slip in here and feel really cool for about seven minutes.  That's it.  Expert.  How lonely are you?  It's like, you ever see people go, like, easy, medium, and then they're like, eh, medium, 
[01:58:30]  maybe I could do that.  Danny goes, blink, blink, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, right to expert, and  just starts playing, and I got to see this.  And then you look around.  You have to look around to see who's like, oh, okay, he's got some game.  He's got game.  He's impressed.  I got to see this.  When he's in the studio, you sounded like Mr. Ed playing with his hooves.  Oh, yeah.  It was fucking awful.  It was like, plink, plink, plink, plink, game over.  Well, that's why, I mean.  Boo.  You hear the people start going, boo.  Boo in the crowd.  It's so funny that it got brought up, because I was just telling a friend of mine, because 
[01:59:00]  when I brought my Xbox here, and it was different, you could make a profile for yourself, and  so Slash had made his own profile on my machine, and I thought that was so cool.  Like, I won't delete it.  I won't let anybody else play on it.  So I just had to retell this whole story, probably like two days ago, how I just ate my  balls in front of Slash.  Well, tomorrow's the day.  I will bring in my console.  I'll make good tomorrow with you.  On expert.  Absolutely.  Right to expert, or are you going to warm up with it?  I don't know.  No, there's no warming up necessarily. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, shit.  He goes right to expert.  Going down tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  I don't know anyone that does expert.  No.  I don't know anyone that can get close to that.  Dude, he owns on expert, too.  It's like, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Even on easy, it kind of looks like when you're driving in the snow after a while.  Do you know what I mean?  I do know what you mean.  It's just coming at you.  It keeps coming.  I'm like, I gotta fucking pull over and check in a motel.  Yeah.  Dude, when I first started playing the Guitar Hero series, I was getting that.  It's almost like a weird vertigo thing, but then it goes away. 
[02:00:00]  It really does go away.  It's like Lucy at the Chocolate Factory.  Yeah, yeah.  It starts all like, I can't do this.  And then you see too many notes that come in at once, and then they're going on angles  across the fretboard, and...  Oh, forget it.  That's for the young.  What songs are on expert?  Like, what's the song difference?  Well, see, all the songs, you know, it runs the difficulty gamut from easy to expert.  It's just that there's more notes, you know, maybe on, like...  No, what's an expert song?  It's just faster.  Oh, something like... 
[02:00:30]  Like, Slow Ride is...  That's an easy one.  That's like the first song that you could possibly play.  Smoke on the Water would be easy.  That's an easy one.  The lead, what's the one, right?  One.  Well, the lead in one is really hard, but like, Cliffs of Dover is a real balanced, like,  it's really hard all around.  That's an expert song?  There's some fucked up patterns going on, yeah.  If it's uneasy, though, there'll be less notes that you have to hit.  I can't get past No Sleep Till Brooklyn.  That's hysterical.  It's just like...  You just gotta tap the notes and come in.  Fucked! 
[02:01:00]  Fucked!  Fucked!  The crowd starts bleeding out.  The drummer stands up all pissed off.  I love the fucking animated drummer's pointing, like, you fucked up!  Dad!  Dad!  Dad!  Boo!  Shut up, you fuck!  Yeah, Danny will just fucking do this and be like...  Tomorrow's the day, Danny.  Oh, this is hard.  No, it's not.  This is so fucking hard.  Sounds like Gary Hoey.  What is this?  It's Eric Dover.  Eric Johnson. 
[02:01:30]  Eric Johnson, yeah.  Who's that?  Oh, my God.  Guitarist.  This on Expert?  Yeah, on Expert.  And they come so quick!  Oh, my God.  And it's like...  They're right across the prep board.  Like, you gotta hit every single one of them.  It's a fucking light show.  You don't like it?  It's driving stoned in a snowstorm.  I don't like this.  With the wipers.  Happy little song.  It's a toe-topper.  It's a happy song?  You play video games, bro?  No, I just got weed.  That's it.  You got the weed?  I just got it.  You know what?  Because I'm still in the faggy zone.  I was in the faggy zone. 
[02:02:00]  I am.  I mean, like...  I want to be with Andy.  Price is right!  I didn't get through this one.  I swear to God.  I want to be with Andy and hate the Wii, but I don't mind it.  I love it.  I don't mind the Wii.  I'm an Xbox fan.  See, when I...  I have the PS3, too.  Yeah, well, you guys don't have kids.  Yeah, you need to wait for the kid.  No, no, no.  But any video game.  Yeah.  I can't even have a conversation on a phone without being in a toilet.  And even then, it's like the blob.  They will find you.  So, once you have kids, it's just a different beast. 
[02:02:30]  You can't even start a game without the...  Can I play?  I want to play.  I want to play.  No, I'm playing.  Just go, I'm playing.  Well, then you got to deal with that again.  Shut up.  They up your ante over and over and over.  It's like having wild chimps, man.  Good luck with that.  See, I need, like, two straight days of pure on-the-road mill nowhere 
[02:03:00]  before I can start playing video games.  Wow.  And video games, too.  Unless I can reset it immediately, like in the old days.  Yeah.  Like, if a kid starts kicking your ass, you just reset.  Fuck you.  Unless you start showing me how to do this shit, I ain't playing.  I didn't get invited over to get my ass kicked for an hour and a half.  And you not tell me your secrets.  Nothing worse than getting into a video game with, like, someone of your skill level.  And there's some competition happening.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden there's the parent, oh, let her have her try. 
[02:03:30]  I hate that.  Oh, fuck.  I hate that.  And then you're like, you try to do the right thing, and it's so frustrating because you're  really in the moment.  You can't get into anything.  Right.  And you're like, fuck.  It's very hard to get into anything.  All right.  It's your turn.  Right.  Once you have kids.  And then you're like, very good.  Very good.  You play the part.  I find myself.  But inside, you want to strangle somebody.  No, not now.  This is like we're going old school here.  Yeah.  Way against him.  To the death.  See, he wants kids.  I hope he wants kids.  Oh, yeah.  Even just, like, playing ball with them in the yard. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I was a great ball player.  So my kids are like, I want to play stickball or whatever.  Wiffle ball is a big one.  After a couple underhands and they miss it, I'm like, all right, we're good.  Right.  We're done.  Show's over.  Because you still want to feel like you could, you know, compete.  So you got your friends over.  Right.  You're in the middle of a good wiffle ball game and, like, here comes the three-year-old.  Can I try?  But if the four-year-old hits one off me, I do with it right at their head next pitch. 
[02:04:30]  You got to give them a little chin music.  I didn't know what the game's really about.  Give them a little red cherry right in their back.  I'll throw myself under the bus.  So I wasn't going to do it, but Sean's with me in Albany.  Opie, you got a Wii Fit goddamn thing.  Goddamn thing is strangely fun.  I do the Wii Fit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The ski jump is awesome.  Really?  Yeah.  Wii Fit's cool. 
[02:05:00]  It's not cool.  It's not just working out, though.  Don't say it's cool.  They got the yoga section.  I don't really...  It's like saying Sunny D is cool.  I don't really venture into the yoga section, but they got games like ski jump, downhill skiing.  Really?  See, I can relate.  What else?  How about Wii mouth on my balls?  That's a game I love.  Or Wii double knuckle.  You see how many Wii glove fingers you can get in your rectum?  That's a game I would purchase.  Games by Jim Norton.  There's time during the day.  Free fingers up the pooper and shave her back and crave her open urinate live on Wii. 
[02:05:30]  Comes out in February.  There's time during the day to do other things.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  People do.  They explore other things.  Yeah, but that would really work out.  I wouldn't just do it with the Wii.  I know.  I'd work out, too.  This is more of a just...  I don't know.  The fucking Wii Fit.  It's terrible.  How about going side to side, kicking the fucking soccer balls that are coming your way with  your head, heading them.  But you've got to watch out for the panda, because it looks like a soccer ball. 
[02:06:00]  A panda?  Of course.  Those fucking Japanese games make no sense.  My Wii Fit friends are understanding.  And they throw shoes.  You've got to duck the shoes, but you've got to hit the soccer balls.  I mean, come on.  Wow.  Exactly.  And then when you think you've got the game down, the black and white fucking panda thing  is coming at you.  You think it's a soccer ball.  Sounds like an argument.  You've got to try to move out of the way.  Wow.  Yeah.  That doesn't make any sense.  What are some of those other Wii Fit games we've got?  I highly suggest the price is right.  You guys will love it.  Price is right. 
[02:06:30]  Oh.  And I just got carnival games for the Wii.  People are raving about that one.  I'm going to check that out.  What?  Yes.  Carnival games?  Yes, Anthony.  You got carnival games?  What, like, try to toss the ring around the fucking milk bottle?  I haven't thrown it in yet.  Coin toss.  Coin toss.  What the fuck kind of games are these?  Those are horrible in real life to do.  All right, I'll tell you the strangest Wii game I got.  Diving.  Diving?  What?  Like in a pool?  Underwater diving.  How do you do it? 
[02:07:00]  Like Luke Hostello's kid.  You jump in the water, and then you just kind of move around and try to find shit.  That's it.  Holy shit.  I don't know what this attraction is with a Wii.  It's the old school.  There was a hunting game where you would go on your PC and try to find the deer.  Yeah.  And the virtual world was huge, and you spent, like, hours just trying to find a deer to shoot.  Yeah, I wasn't into the hunting games either.  You know the one I'm talking about, though?  Yeah.  It was kind of big for a while. 
[02:07:30]  This is underwater.  I've been distracted.  You're diving.  Yeah.  Is there bubble sound effects?  All that.  Oh, yeah, you hear the breathing.  Yeah.  I need massive destruction in video gaming.  Yeah, you need, like, the war game.  I need blowing up, death destruction.  I've walked over the Bouncing Bettys in Call of Duty 5, where I've seen my guy fly up in 
[02:08:00]  the air with his legs missing.  Yeah.  And then just smash on the ground.  That shit's cool, too.  And I just get killed.  But I was laughing, going, like, wow, I really fucking bought it that time.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  My nephew zips it out.  He's only five.  The kid's a beast.  Yeah, yeah.  They keep it quiet, because that's a big thing now.  See, my little kid can't even play with a gun.  My four-year-old kid loves guns, swords.  I may have to question her a couple years.  It's a girl.  That's a bra man.  Oh, girl likes the...  Uh-oh. 
[02:08:30]  Shirt's always off.  Wow.  What the hell's going on there?  Her name's Zoe, yeah.  My name is Zar.  All right.  All right.  Likes guns.  But she likes fucking Call of Duty.  Yeah.  She plays Call of Duty?  Yeah.  Yeah, she watches...  Your mom's not home, right?  Never.  Whenever mom's not home, I can't even listen to my music.  No.  Yeah, man.  You'll see.  Well, you won't see.  No, you won't see.  It's not going to see.  I don't think Jimbo will see either.  No.  Jimbo will never see. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, before we move on from the Wii, we got Ed in Philly.  Ed.  Yo, hey, I'm with you on the Wii Fit games.  I got Wii Sports last month.  And you can create your own avatar.  My wife and I created ourselves.  There's boxes.  If I could beat the hell out of my wife on the Wii Fit.  He beats his wife on the Wii Fit.  Good frustration.  Maybe I would have saved your marriage.  You can box each other.  Wii police come over and arrest you. 
[02:09:30]  Wii.  Push in the Wii Wii gel.  Yeah.  The Wii gel.  Serve your Wii papers.  Wii restraining order.  Not allowed to go near the game.  It's like, truly fucks you up.  It's like, I can't even play the game anymore.  You going on?  She's having sex with a black avatar.  Yeah.  If you want to prep the bowl, press...  You got a wee-wee in your ass.  A wee gel.  Wee cuckled.  You're a wee cuck, yeah.  Wee cuck. 
[02:10:00]  You rock.  By the way, prep the wee bowl.  Get it nice and sloppy.  Sorry, you rock.  A lot of people checking in saying five-year-olds play the Lego game.  Screw them.  Yeah, it does.  Five-year-olds play the fucking Lego game.  I got it for Christmas.  It's great.  It's not great.  It is great.  No, it's not great.  And we were talking about PS Home.  We got Eric in Indiana.  Eric.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yeah, the best part about PlayStation Home is that you can have preset multi-different  avatars, and you can switch between them real quick, and you can go out there as a  girl and walk around and say, who wants to hook up with me?  And as soon as guys come over and start dancing with you, the key is you've got to dance 
[02:10:30]  the salsa, because when you switch over to the elderly black guy, it looks like he's just  drunk waddling around in a circle, and these guys are all trying to make out with you.  That would be hilarious.  I don't know if I could be a chicken on line.  It's funny.  I'm a black guy on line, and boy, I kind of understand racism a little bit better.  Oh, really?  My freaking Tiger Woods golf guy is black, and when people are getting pissed because  I'm kicking their ass, oh, wow.  Because you're always late to the game.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[02:11:00]  Wow, they let me have it.  Do they?  Yeah.  Oh, and I refuse to go white.  I refuse to go white.  I'm actually trying to make them as dark as possible on line.  I know on Call of Duty, boy, because that's voice, you know?  You put on a little headset and you can talk.  I've heard plenty of stuff.  I've uttered some things.  That is creepy.  Wow, they get pretty nasty with people.  But it's creepy when you hook up with the guys that got the audio on, because I play Tiger Woods.  You don't really need the audio.  You're not doing them for the call. 
[02:11:30]  Nice shot.  Yeah, it's beautiful day, isn't it?  It's not talking about the virtual day.  But all of a sudden you hear dogs barking like, I'm on the 40th floor.  And then you hear doors opening and kids running in.  I'm like, what the?  Because you forget that they have their audio on.  Yeah.  You feel like you're hearing shit.  Why are you playing with other people?  How does that work?  It's cool, man.  You play online.  That's the best thing of any game.  That's the best part.  All of a sudden you're just playing some other dude or chick somewhere in the world. 
[02:12:00]  We were playing Call of Duty and stupid Bob Kelly on purpose would take the headset mic,  shove it right under his nose.  So you're playing the game and everyone on the game is hearing this heavy, fucking nasty  breathing going on because he on purpose shoves it right under his nose.  Take a break.  I'm rubbing my penis.  Are you?  Yeah, because you notice what I got to do.  One more thing, though, before we end the whole console discussion, I can't consider 
[02:12:30]  the Wii a real console because in between games it tells you you should go outside and  take a break to get some air.  Fuck you.  This fucking stinks.  I swear to God, there's a panel where it looks like a window frame with curtains and the  sun is outside and it's just feeling fatigued.  Take a break.  Close enough.  You just showed me a window.  Well, they're scared that someone's going to drop playing Wii Fit.  Well, they have, yeah.  Yeah, but it's not just fit.  It's all the games.  It's, you know, the sports.  It's Mario everything. 
[02:13:00]  But I see where this Wii Fit, not Wii Fit, the Wii is going.  It's going to get so much better in the next few years, I really think.  Oh, all the games get better.  They really do.  Like when E-Rock had the Mario car, he just had the steering wheel up in the air.  Dude, it was fucking, if you wound up like Jay in Mansfield, I would have been fucking  happy with that.  It was so awful.  There was something cool about that.  He's just holding the steering wheel and it's not attached to anything.  You can play with the remote or the steering wheel and I got it, but you know, it'd be 
[02:13:30]  easy to beat him up.  But I was having fun just fucking playing the Mario car with the floating steering wheel.  There's a monster on a motorcycle and he's like riding through the floating cubes.  It's like fucking eight-year-old child shit.  I guess it is.  It's not cool.  They could have made that like adult, like a real car, but you're on an island and through  water.  It was fucking blue.  All night.  It was like a magic land.  It'd be quiet and then Jim would just yell from the back of the apartment, why is there  a turtle shell?  Why is there a monster?  It was so fucking turtle shell. 
[02:14:00]  It was just fucking blue.  And you left my party to, well, I don't know if I should mention this.  You left the party a little early because we ended up singing karaoke with a bunch of  Asians.  Were you there for that, E-Rock?  Yeah.  I would never.  As soon as you went to that door, I would have beelined to the elevator.  I met my neighbor for the first time in a year and a half.  Oh, yeah?  And I live in an apartment.  It's not that hard.  That's not like walking across the street or through a few...  What, did they have a little party going on over there? 
[02:14:30]  In my bedroom.  You come in, yeah.  Yeah, and now me too.  Oh, really?  Hey?  One guy?  He had some friends over there.  It was one dude.  He was throwing firecrackers?  From my bedroom, I could see into this window.  And from time to time, it looks like all hell's going on in there, whatever.  And one time I saw a disco ball just rotating and just flashing lights.  Fuck.  And we're like, what the fuck is this?  So New Year's Eve, we heard a lot of noise coming from there. 
[02:15:00]  So, of course, my girl knocks on the door with a bottle of wine.  Next thing you know, we're all in there.  And it's just a bunch of us and a bunch of horrified Asians singing karaoke.  Yeah, bad 80s rock.  Oh, they love that, yeah.  Dude, they hated that.  Well, the guy that owns the apartment loved the fact that we were there, but his friends  were like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Why did you invite people?  Why are you playing a white guy?  Why did you invite?  Around that room party.  It's like, why did you invite people with personalities into your apartment? 
[02:15:30]  Mama, we all kissing us.  Yeah.  Were they any good?  I love that.  Singing, hit me with your best shot.  Hit me with my best shot.  And Disney, so I face the final car time.  It was hilarious to watch him sing.  Yes.  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Robin Anthony, Sirius XM.  All right.  Breaking news, Anthony.  Tomorrow on the show.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  We got Danny showing off.  He's going to be doing some Guitar Hero Expert for everybody.  We're giving him another shot, finally, because he failed so miserably in front of Slash last  time we tried this.  Yeah, it was embarrassing.  Remember the Plank Plank Plank.  Boo!  Boo!  Ooh, fade to black.  What?  I can't.  I will guarantee that there will not be a repeat of that Slash incident.  Well, Sam is in studio with breaking news.  Sam, what do you got?  Well, somebody wants to compete tomorrow.  Somebody wants Danny to prove himself. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, snap.  Wait, you mean wants to compete against Danny?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Not just compete, wants to humble Danny.  Is that what he's saying?  Oh.  No, but I can tell by his tone of voice.  Why?  Is he kind of like making believe, I know a little something about Guitar Hero?  He's like, hey, you think maybe I could challenge Danny?  Oh, shit.  No one.  Watch.  This is my big, because it's new intern Evan.  Oh, is he trying too hard now?  Because, uh...  He wouldn't be that stupid.  This is going to be... 
[02:17:00]  I would imagine that...  Look, he doesn't know radio, but I'm starting to think he might know this Guitar Hero.  This is going to be his big comeback.  He's going to look different in your guy's eyes.  Yeah.  Evan.  You know what I say to this?  I say, bo-ring it.  Wow.  Whoa!  Bo-ring it.  Wow.  Bring it.  Uh, hello, Evan.  Hi, guys.  Jim, this is Evan.  Hey, Evan.  He's a new intern, brand new.  Yes.  What's the matter?  You having trouble with headphones?  Farm round chin.  Good boy.  How nervous he is.  His headphones fell off his head five times. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Five times.  I'm getting acclimated.  So, he's nervous.  Give me a few days.  Yeah.  You're a little nervous, right?  A few days.  A little nervous.  No, but Danny, I did overhear you talking about it, and I would like to extend the challenge  out to you.  Oh!  Listen to the dry mouth and everything.  I'm going to extend my penis into your mouth.  That's what I'm extending.  Damn.  Listen to this smack talk.  You could try to take my title away, but you will have a long...  What's your title?  Guitar Hero Champion. 
[02:18:00]  Pianos.  Yeah.  July 4th, 2007.  I kicked everyone's ass.  It's on the web.  It's got to be true.  It's on a geek site?  Yeah, it's a blog.  Geek and Nerd.  And people say that I rule on it.  See?  Look.  What is that?  I beat that guy.  That guy.  Well...  Look at this guy.  What is this guy?  With his tucked in shirt and his bunt.  You had all the big competitors.  Oh, yeah.  They were all out.  They were out in full force, and I kicked every one of their asses.  You beat a warhead.  That's great.  You beat fucking Kim Jong-il. 
[02:18:30]  Look.  Look at that last photo.  These fucking assholes tried kicking over my beer to distract me, but nothing would  take me away from my goal.  Yeah.  From my purpose.  So your title is what?  Guitar Hero Champion Pianos Guitar Hero Tuesdays on July 4th, 2007.  How the fuck did you get that on a trophy?  I guess that's why they didn't give me one.  Well, all I know is I've never been defeated before.  Wait a minute.  Never been defeated.  Never. 
[02:19:00]  That's right, Danny.  You play on Expert?  Who are you playing?  Oh, yeah.  Five-year-olds?  Yeah.  I've got to be honest with you, man.  No, I've...  That kid's...  His eyes and his intensity...  I know these type of kids.  These are kids that...  He's not going to play sports with you on the street.  Uh-huh.  He's not going to...  He's not going to knock too many things out.  But when he's ready to tear shit up, he will come out of the woodwork.  And that's what he's doing.  And I got my money on this kid, because he's got that confidence.  He came straight in here.  You know what?  He's got a swaggy with his ACDC ridiculous hat on. 
[02:19:30]  This one.  I'm taking this kid.  Thank you for your skill.  I got my money on this kid.  His voice is cracking just being in the studio.  Let me see him try to perform in front of everybody.  Because this is not his game.  He's not going to be able to handle that kind of pressure.  His game is the fucking guitar team.  I happen to be starting at Brook University Guitar Hero champion two years in a row.  Don't tell him your credits, Hammer.  What's a champion?  I got you.  Don't tell him your credits.  I got some champion.  You don't need to just stare him down.  Listen, Danny, his voice may be cracking, but his fingers won't be.  Sam, are you his manager?  I'm his manager. 
[02:20:00]  I got him, too.  Don't crack.  Do you have your own?  Don't smile, either.  What?  A guitar?  Yeah.  A guitar hero?  Yeah, because you can't use mine.  I don't want your filthy fucking intern fingers on it.  Fair enough.  He uses a winner's guitar, Danny.  Not your cheap guitar.  Wow.  They're all the same.  They come with the package.  Not the one he has.  It's gold.  Danny, you need a manager?  Yeah, I do.  I want my own hype man.  I'm so sick of Sam being everybody's fucking hype man around here.  Not everybody.  What do you want?  I'm tired of primetime Sam Roberts trying to fucking turn everything into wrestling. 
[02:20:30]  I love it.  It's not wrestling.  It's Guitar Hero.  Yeah, we're talking about Guitar Hero.  It's completely different things here.  They're both very mature.  It's now the wrestling thing.  It works.  Who do you want?  David?  I say David's your hype man.  David, come on in here.  Oh, great.  It's only fair.  Get David his mic.  Yeah, hype me up.  David, hold on a minute.  Let us get you a mic.  He looks like the new Bernie Brilstein.  That's what we're getting.  Everyone comments.  Everyone comments on how Jewish can a guy be. 
[02:21:00]  All right, listen.  And that is the picture.  Holy shit.  Danny, you're the champion of what?  I am the champion of Piano Presents Guitar Hero Tuesdays, July 4th, 2007.  And Evan, you're the champ of what?  Stony Brook University.  That's the entire university.  What?  You're the best in all of Stony Brook?  Yeah.  How many people go to that school?  Five.  No, it was about 15,000 people.  15,000.  He's better than all of them.  Oh, shit.  How many play fucking guitar hero, though? 
[02:21:30]  This guy already, I don't even know these two, but this guy already crashed under pressure  with Slash.  He crashed intensely.  Oh, you never beat Slash?  He's a lot of talk.  He darts a lot.  That was technical difficulties.  I'm going for the kid.  You always got to be prepared for that stuff.  I think this kid here would be able to adjust to that glitch in no time.  If I can bet.  Oh, there's no way to adjust to a timing glitch between visual and audio as far as guitar hero  goes.  There's a list of control within the game that you could adjust.  Oh, shit. 
[02:22:00]  He knows everything was tried.  Now, I don't look at you.  Now, I don't look at you.  Am I fucking retarded?  I don't know that.  I explained.  Maybe if you listened to the show that you work for now, you would have understood that  the way it was set up originally had video going through a video router, which in turn  creates a slight delay.  If we hook it up directly to the TV and bypass the router itself, there will be no glitch.  I understand how to calibrate lag on a guitar hero game. 
[02:22:30]  In turn.  He's not here for a budget.  It's like you're saying the lag thing.  We understand the lag thing.  Why don't you just tell me to adjust my tracking on my VCR?  It was completely different.  It's like taking an out-of-focus picture and then trying to focus it with a focus knob.  Right.  It's only going to get so good.  God.  Well, he was just throwing out the...  He's an idiot.  I'm not saying he's not a blithering idiot and a real albatross for this radio program.  I'm not saying what he is.  He just threw out a suggestion.  Basically, did you try that?  And Danny Alvarez said it. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, but that's like, Danny Alvarez is a little loud.  The important thing is...  It's a little loud.  The important thing is David hasn't hyped Danny.  David is the worst hype man ever.  David, you're the hype man for Danny.  Yeah, you're supposed to be pumping me up.  The big guitar hero competition is going out tomorrow.  Fuck your home lane.  All right, here it goes.  Go ahead, David.  Take Sam on.  Go.  The hype man going at it.  What you got over there with this kid?  What you got?  What you got about?  Do you think...  He's so bad. 
[02:23:30]  What you got with this kid?  You know how good Evan is?  You know what his nickname is?  No.  Oh, shit.  What?  The fire man.  The fire man.  Why?  Because he heats up.  What does that even mean?  It's fire.  It's slang for very good.  What does he heat up?  Fire man put fires out, though.  No, no, no.  He's the fire man.  He makes fire.  It's like a superhero.  What does that have to do with guitar hero, though?  He's a flamer?  No, he might be.  It's not related to Guitar Hero, but that means he's going to crash and burn in front  of Danny.  That's right.  Fire men don't burn.  Why? 
[02:24:00]  What?  That's what they do.  Hey, why?  Yes.  Why are you wiping Danny when we got David?  If he's a fire man, I'm a captain.  All right, listen.  David.  Because David sucks.  David.  He's going to come out with fire engines.  David.  We're learning that Evan's nickname is the fire man.  I don't even know what that means.  Volunteer fire man.  I don't even know what that means, to be honest.  You know what his last name is?  I haven't sliced ideas.  He's the fire man Evan Champion.  That's his last name.  Champion.  What is he?  What has this kid ever won?  He won Guitar Hero at Stony Brook. 
[02:24:30]  We established it, David.  Have you been to Stony Brook?  Have you seen him?  Yes, I was there.  When were you at Stony Brook?  I was managing him.  He beat 15,000 people.  15,000?  Every single student at Stony Brook University played Guitar Hero?  Not well.  Not as good as Evan Champion.  The fire man.  I don't think...  Has Evan Champion met Daniel Ross yet?  Yes.  Oh, there we go.  I don't think my parents have met Daniel Ross.  I don't think anybody... 
[02:25:00]  I don't think you have met Daniel Ross yet.  That's Danny's nickname.  Danny Daniel Ross.  That reminds me of...  It sounds very familiar.  It's almost like Nathaniel Than Brian.  Well, what does Danny bring to the table for this match-up there?  You have not met Daniel Ross.  Talk about my skills.  Come on, let's go.  Talk him up.  Daniel Ross has won Piano Tuesday's Guitar Hero.  Wow, that's impressive.  What have you won?  Stony Brook?  Big deal.  Yeah, it's a university.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  It's a university.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, well...  And most people...  And I'm like you.  Good one's a Nero.  Oh, oh.  A university.  Oh.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Most people are...  You're off playing guitar here while everybody else is studying.  But, David...  David, you're trying to say that a bar is more impressive than beating a whole university?  Yes.  Danny can go from bar to bar all he wants, beating five people here, three people over there. 
[02:26:00]  My man, Evan Champion, the fireman, beats 15,000 at a time.  At a time.  You're talking about Danny, the gunslinger Ross.  No, his nickname is Daniel.  No, no.  It's the gunslinger.  No, it's like...  He wears that guitar like a gun, slung over his shoulder, ready to just pull out and destroy.  Destroy.  Evan wears the guitar like a hose.  That's why I call him the fireman.  You know what I mean? 
[02:26:30]  He aims at black people.  Evan's a racist.  Wow.  David, final thoughts?  Goes down tomorrow.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh!  Wait, can I ask what version of Guitar Hero will we be playing?  Oh!  Why should it matter?  Because we can play all of them.  Because we can play all of them.  Why should it matter?  But we just want to know.  But we can play all of them.  What version are we playing, Danny?  What do you want?  Lego Guitar Hero?  Is that the one you need?  Why are you out, Danny? 
[02:27:00]  Throughout the games, the mechanics change.  Drink them, buddy.  It's going to be...  Uh-oh, he's got a point.  What makes the lights change?  The way the interface with the guitar and how it operates.  Yeah, and they all have different outfits and everything.  And we can do all of them, but we just want to know before.  The response to the buttons.  No.  Oh, shit.  Now...  And how the system deals with it.  This is him right now.  He's panicking.  He's panicking.  He's making an...  This is a foresight of an excuse.  Right now we're hearing where he'll go tomorrow.  Oh, see, this was what I was talking about yesterday. 
[02:27:30]  The equipment.  Give Danny anything.  Give him a broken fucking garbage can.  Ask me which one I want to play.  Okay, which one would you like to play?  I don't give a fuck!  Oh, shit!  In your face!  That's right!  You shouldn't have asked him that.  You shouldn't have asked him that.  That was a good idea.  No.  You should not have asked him that.  That was a good idea.  Wait, David.  David.  Oh, David.  Look out.  Look out.  Here he comes.  Yes, David.  Here he comes.  You know what?  You...  How about the intern chooses  what guitar,  what version,  what outfit, 
[02:28:00]  what character?  Daniel will do any character,  any version,  any outfit,  any guitar.  You won't.  No, I don't...  I do not play as Johnny Napalm.  Except for Johnny Napalm.  We can play as Johnny Napalm  any day of the week.  What's wrong with Johnny Napalm  for us people that aren't in the world?  He's queer.  He's queer.  Except for Johnny Napalm,  any character,  any guitar,  any outfit,  any version,  my Daniel Ross  will take you on  any other version.  My Daniel Ross.  I'm terrible. 
[02:28:30]  Why don't you just use my full name?  My middle name is Jason.  Just go for the gold.  My Daniel Jason.  Yeah.  You can't play guitar hero  in front of my son, David.  You won at Stony Brook.  How many people  were you competing against?  For real.  And don't say 15,000.  It wasn't 15,000.  No.  But I would say  it was a several round system  and I'd say total  in the area  between 100,  150.  100,  150.  And you won them all.  Whooped all of them.  You beat them all.  It wasn't even close.  In a round robin format. 
[02:29:00]  It wasn't even close.  It wasn't even close.  Alright,  I made my decision.  Evan.  Sorry, Danny.  No.  In a row.  He beat them all in a row.  In a row.  But it doesn't matter.  They could have all sucked.  In a row.  In a row.  They could have all sucked.  I'm not going to lie.  A good portion of them  didn't suck.  I know.  But an even greater portion  did not.  A large enough sample set  is going to happen.  Wait, wait, wait.  A good portion sucks.  But an even larger...  An even larger portion  did not suck  and he beat them all.  I am so going with Danny here. 
[02:29:30]  As a matter of fact...  Oh, that's right.  I want a little action.  Oh, shit.  I now want a little action.  Put your money on the table.  I got...  Here we go, my friend.  You're going to lose  a lot of money, Ant.  40, 60, 80...  40, he's used to it.  I got a...  Yeah, believe me.  I got a crisp fiber.  I'm going with a...  I'm going 100 bucks  here on Danny.  What's with 100 bucks?  I'm going to buy Daniel  and Jason rocks.  I'll take action.  Be quiet.  Counting you out, Ben.  I'll straight talk over there. 
[02:30:00]  I just made two G's  off of General Motors woes.  So, fuck them.  There you go.  It's 100 bucks  you'll never see again.  Never.  Never.  Ooh, Stony Brook.  See, I noticed...  This is my confidence.  All right, we get it.  Jesus Christ.  Stony Brook sucks.  Wait, what did you say, David?  I'm going Danny Daniel loss.  Yeah.  What's up?  I'm just saying...  I'm just dissing Stony Brook.  I agree with you.  It's an awful, awful school.  But the Guitar Hero players 
[02:30:30]  are the best.  No, apparently they suck.  The majority of them suck.  No, a good portion,  but a greater portion.  No, it can't be a good portion  and a greater portion.  It's like 47% suck,  but 53%...  No.  Do not.  What's the matter?  I will beat the shit out  of any Suffolk County queer  that steps foot in this studio.  Wow.  And I'll take your $100.  Oh, wait a minute.  He's from Suffolk?  Yes.  I'm in.  He's in Suffolk?  I'm in.  Queens, bitch!  What?  He's representing Queens,  motherfucker. 
[02:31:00]  That's the city.  What do you got?  I'm Suffolk there.  C.  I will let you select the game  and the songs to play.  Wow.  The songs.  Yeah.  How many Ws are in that word?  None, Danny.  I have an accent.  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Fuck it.  Sam answers them.  No Ws.  There's only going to be one W,  and it's going to stand for win,  and it's coming Evan Champion's way  tomorrow morning.  Oh, shit.  No, the only W is going to be  the one I leave out on his face 
[02:31:30]  after I fucking wipe the floor with him.  All right, what song?  That's a shit reference.  I got it.  She has that volunteer fire sound  going up before he comes out.  I don't know.  I say it's a three-song match.  Three-song match.  Three-song match.  Well, see, I have Guitar Hero 2.  I have Guitar Hero 3.  I have Guitar Hero Aerosmith.  And Guitar Hero World Tour.  Have you played all those?  What do you have, sir?  I have all of those.  You have them.  You own them.  And at your house. 
[02:32:00]  And he's got that.  What about Rock Band?  I don't own Rock Band.  Oh!  We don't play Rock Band.  We play Guitar Hero.  We don't play Rock Band.  It's a whole other platform.  Rock Band.  Just saying.  Queens.  So that's like saying,  well, you know,  look, I only play people  in the National League.  I don't play the Yankees.  I don't play them.  I'm not familiar with the songs.  I'm not familiar with the American League,  so I don't play them.  And he's got Guitar Hero DS, too,  on his Nintendo DS.  What, Dick Sucker?  No.  Oh, shit.  Dual screen. 
[02:32:30]  Good one.  I fly a plane.  I fly a plane.  He flies with the Blue Angels.  That's what he's saying.  That's the whole fucking Guitar Hero.  And you don't understand.  You are out of your league.  You're out of your league.  To be honest,  I've been playing this game  for a long time,  and I've been waiting  for the day I could be defeated.  It just does not come.  You're dangerous, Evan.  Evan's not losing tomorrow.  One of these days,  those Guitar Hero fingers  are going to write a check  that your body can't cash.  Whoa.  Evan's not losing tomorrow.  The fireman never met a fire  he couldn't put out. 
[02:33:00]  Here, wait.  Everyone,  I want you to listen to this.  Oh, shit.  Did you hear that?  It was my teeth snapping.  We just did an Iceman  in the locker room.  Next,  we're going to take our shirts off  and play some volleyball.  Thanks to Travis,  who got me a Top Gun in Blu-ray,  so I get to watch that scene  in every perfect 1080p detail.  Oh, nice.  Every beat of sweat  off of their bodies.  Stop it.  How am I supposed to beat  this kid with a motor?  We're not going to anyway.  So what's the format  of this contest going to be?  Me beating you. 
[02:33:30]  Two out of three falls.  Two out of three.  Two out of three.  Two out of three.  All right.  Two out of three,  head to head,  same fucking song.  I like it.  Same, you know,  expert.  You got to play an expert.  All right.  And you get one fucking chance  at each song.  There's no stopping and going,  oh, wait a minute,  fucking, you know,  I had a fart.  Well, is it delay?  There won't be any delay.  Everything will work.  No, everything's got to be,  you know, tested and made sure  it works.  But then once the contest  is underway,  you guys will do three songs. 
[02:34:00]  Best two out of three.  Of course,  I believe right now,  and I'll even make  a side wager on this,  Danny's taking three  out of three.  You won't win one round  against Danny.  He's not going to get  one in.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Evan Champion takes it  in two.  Wow.  In a row.  Get out.  All right.  It's on for tomorrow.  Let's end with Sam hyping up  Evan for 30 seconds,  and then David will get 30 seconds.  It's got to hype Danny.  All right.  Here we go.  Sam,  you've got 30 seconds  starting right now 
[02:34:30]  for the big match tomorrow.  Danny,  understand this.  The fireman Evan Champion  comes for only one reason,  and that's to win.  He wins like a fireman  puts fires out.  You understand?  And that's how he plays  Guitar Hero.  And you're going to get  introduced to Guitar Hero,  not Guitar Hero Tuesday,  Guitar Hero Thursday,  and that's the day  that your Guitar Hero Tuesday  trophy goes down the tubes.  We go champion for champion.  Evan walks out.  Two belts richer.  I forgot.  That's why they named him  Champion the day he was born. 
[02:35:00]  I have another credit,  actually.  What?  I completely forgot about.  I am also,  in addition to July 4th  Guitar Hero Tuesdays  at Piano's champion in 2007,  I believe I am also  the PNC Bank Art Center  parking lot champion.  Holy shit,  that's right.  From the virus tour last year.  Yeah,  how about that?  Yes.  What?  PNC Art Center.  You might have heard  of that little place.  Might have heard  of that little venue.  Wait,  Brewer doesn't think  that's a great credit.  Sort of crowd  not impressed,  intoxicated by 11,  half them were out of the gig.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:35:30]  Don't worry about it.  Let me fucking tell you  something,  Evan,  the fireman.  No,  this is not supposed  to be happening.  All this talk  is supposed to be  coming from David.  Let me tell you something  about that PNC performance.  If that fucking  generator didn't run out of gas,  they would have been  held up at him.  Why do you think  it ran out of gas?  He was fucking  wearing on there so much.  I was burning it up!  Burn it up, Danny,  because the fireman  is going to put you out.  All right,  listen to David now.  David,  you've got 30 seconds  to hype Danny  for the big match tomorrow.  starting right now. 
[02:36:00]  You think you're  a fireman?  You can't even put out  Danny.  Danny's burning.  Daniel J.  Ross,  you have nothing  on this guy.  You think you're so  good because you go  to Stony Brook?  You know who goes to  Stony Brook?  a bunch of college nerds  go to Stony Brook?  A bunch of nerds.  My Daniel J.  Ross is a champion  from all the boards  in New York City.  Beat that!  Beat that!  You've got 10 more seconds.  You've got 10 more seconds.  Just say 718  over and over again.  Real intimidating.  718?  Yeah!  718! 
[02:36:30]  718!  718!  You have nothing!  718!  718, motherfucker!  Represent!  All right.  Jesus.  Tomorrow.  By the way,  Danny,  totally fucking up  Guitar Hero  in front of Slash  will be playing  what,  after our live show  today?  Good.  It was one of my  favorite moments.  Good.  You'll see the contrast  now from that  as opposed to tomorrow  when he rules.  That's right.  Problem is,  people are going to  hear that after the show  and then tomorrow  morning they'll think  it's a replay  when he's fucking up again.  Oh!  Yeah, nice. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, no!  Damn.  They'll be like,  look at the curve.  This kid really  picked it up quick.  I can't wait for tomorrow.  Wow, Evan,  really overconfident,  I think.  Is Rob Halford here  to comment about  Guitar Hero?  I'm looking around  for sure.  Is Rob possibly?  He's been retired  for quite a while now.  Oh, okay.  I come from  the School of Champions.  I've been nurtured  by the likes  of Billy Mitchell.  Ah.  You don't know  Billy Mitchell?  King of con.  And I subscribe 
[02:37:30]  to the Billy Mitchell  way of life.  Yes.  And you can take  your Steve Weeb ass  back to fucking  Seattle,  wherever that  little pussy lives.  Who holds the record?  Billy fucking Mitchell  does.  Steve Weeby does.  Well, that's...  Set it after the credits.  Set it after the credits.  Look, let's not get  into a big King of Con  argument here, okay?  I didn't see it.  It's a great movie.  I saw a fucking text  on the screen.  I didn't see the win.  Danny, you take  your taped scores  and go home.  Look, I don't submit  taped scores, okay? 
[02:38:00]  Because we're doing  them live tomorrow.  I'm going to bust  out my American flag  tie and this is  going down.  It's going down.  Stony Brook.  All right.  All right.  This is huge.  This is huge.  All right.  Very good.  This is a great  fucking match.  What, Rob?  This ain't Rob.  This is fucking...  Jimmy's sleeping.  He's resting his eyes.  He's going to bed.  Sharon.  My bet is for 
[02:38:30]  the fella that goes  to school.  He's fucking great,  Sharon.  I say we fucking  signed this guy  for our new show.  He's going to be  a fucking smash hit,  Ozzy.  I don't trust the  fella with the hat.  He looks more like  a poser.  I kind of like his  look.  I like his look.  That's all great.  We know it's  awesome, Dave.  We're enjoying it.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:39:00]  Who said that?  Him?  Like a new neck  guy for Danny.  And let me tell you,  Jim James Pruer  is so good.  Wow.  Well, I see.  I do notice that  our intern, David,  is wearing some  neck piece today.  You got the bling  or something?  There's a little bling,  and I do recognize  that that is  intern MVP  neck gear.  Of the day.  So I think we need  to give Dave a big hand  for being the intern  MPV of the day.  I don't know about you,  but somebody's  getting pregnant. 
[02:39:30]  Hey, Tracy,  what do you think  of the big match  going down tomorrow?  Hey, yo!  All I know  is this motherfucker  here,  yo,  he better show up  with his shirt off  or we gonna be  hyping shit up  and I'm gonna win  an Emmy this year  because I'll be working  with Alec Baldwin.  Alec Baldwin.  I'm gonna win an Emmy  when I'm done.  Somebody's getting  pregnant.  What the fuck  is he talking about  is a pregnancy? 
[02:40:00]  I don't know  what he's saying,  Tracy,  but he's quite  disturbing.  Hey, yo!  Fuck a rat chick  any day.  Bang,  Mrs. Osborne  till my toes  be curling  straight up in the air.  David is the worst  pitch man.  I like this kid,  man.  He's funny.  Oh, he's great.  He did alright.  But he's not  a very good pitch man.  He did alright in the end  there. 
[02:40:30]  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  He's funny.  Primetime Sam Roberts  knows how to work  the mic.  I understand that.  What he's saying  into it is bullshit.  What?  But you know  how to work it.  He's fireman  versus Daniel.  Fireman.  Well, it's better  than Daniel.  Out of all the names  you could have picked,  why?  Where's there a fire?  It doesn't make sense.  I don't see  what's on fire.  What's better  than a fireman?  Every kid growing up  wants to be what?  About an astronaut.  Fireman.  Astronauts are  yesterday's news. 
[02:41:00]  Nobody wants  to go to space anymore.  Hey, David,  what's Danny's nickname  again?  He's Daniel Jason Ross.  His name is  Daniel Jason Ross.  Yes, sir.  His name is  Daniel Jason Ross.  I don't see any fire.  Are you saying  the consoles  and the guitars  are going to be on fire?  What's this nonsense?  The shredding  I will do  will create such heat  that they will  create fire.  Oh, wow.  Ah.  Stupid.  I don't think so.  Shredding?  What? 
[02:41:30]  The only friction  that's being produced  is your gums  flapping, Sonny.  Wow.  Yeah, I agree.  Danny, are you nervous?  I agree.  Look at him shaking.  He's shaking a little bit.  He's shaking a little bit.  Please.  Physically, he's shaking.  I'm fine.  You're going to have to  look at it this way.  Yeah.  He loses.  There's no pressure.  He loses.  You lose.  I want to lose.  It's going to be  a catastrophe.  Catastrophe.  He loses.  All the pressure.  I want a competition.  No one's come close  to me ever. 
[02:42:00]  All the pressure.  How often do you play?  I used to play a lot.  Now I'm not.  Oh, now you've lost  all your skills.  He's just kidding.  He plays every day.  He takes the neighborhood kids.  He's talking about  a 2004 victory.  Don't worry about it.  Evan, give us a move.  Let's see if I'm like.  Give us a move.  Go ahead.  Show me a little  fucking picking.  Yeah, let's see  these fingers move.  Let's see how fast  they can move.  Here we go.  Look at those go.  Look at them.  Look at them.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You see that? 
[02:42:30]  Well, I do also  play the real guitar.  You do.  You believe this, guys?  So does Danny.  Yeah?  He's got the fastest.  And the drums.  I'm a drummer foremost.  And he plays tambourine, too.  And tambourine.  Tambourine.  Yeah, he plays  the triangle.  Well, yeah.  The drums and percussion.  Yeah, the wooden block.  Oh, percussion.  You in a band?  No, no, no.  He's good.  You in a band?  No, not right now.  He's a one-man band.  No, no, no.  He's good.  He's been playing  for 12 years. 
[02:43:00]  Danny, how long  are you playing guitar?  Real guitar or  plastic guitar?  Wow.  I mean, it's probably  over 10 years,  but I haven't really  been keeping up with it.  Not equal.  You know.  Oh, man.  I'm rusty.  This is, uh...  Evan does vocals, too.  He can sing, too.  Oh, really?  That's actually  the only thing I can.  He can sing.  Give him a song.  He'll sing it.  I have less than...  Holy Sam.  What a bastard Sam.  Okay, let's see.  Okay.  I literally have  less than an octave range.  He can do it.  Anything you throw at him, 
[02:43:30]  he'll sing.  Actually, my falsetto  is pretty good.  Yeah, the falsetto is good.  Okay, I'll just bring  my rock band tomorrow also.  Let's hear your falsetto.  Let's hear this falsetto.  Well, give me a song  to sing.  Any song.  Stayin' Alive, the Bee Gees.  Ah, that's a good  falsetto song.  Well, you can't tell  by the way I use my walk.  I'm the warmest man.  Don't tell him to talk.  You can't wear the beard  of the beard  when I know the words.  But you can't tell.  You can't even tell  he doesn't know the words.  Sam.  Sam can work anything. 
[02:44:00]  Props to Sam.  Danny, you got any  falsetto in you?  Oh, I got tons.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you want me to sing?  What do you got?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't think of a song.  Yeah, he doesn't have anything.  Nothing.  I can't think of a good one.  I want to have a good one  if I'm going to do it, right?  Did you hear how quick  he thought of the Bee Gees?  Yeah.  He didn't think of that.  You thought of that, too.  No, he had it.  Big girls don't cry.  Big girls don't cry.  See, it's good.  It's better than your shit. 
[02:44:30]  I can get vibrato  on my falsetto.  He was on key.  You weren't really on key there.  Well, my mouth is very dry.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Take your hands off your hips.  It's making everyone uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Thank you.  All right.  I think we've done enough  to hype this thing for tomorrow.  It's going to be a big day.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh.  We should have tens of listeners.  Oh, it's going to be great.  Come on.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:45:00]  This is a huge competition now.  Who is not tuning in  to listen to Guitar Hero  on the radio?  Vicious violence attack  and broken out  in such cities  in Miami and Wisconsin.  It depends on your songs you pick.  Guitar Hero Battle  will go down  on the Opie and Anthony show.  There have to be epic songs  that we pick.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't play songs  that aren't epic.  They're beneath him.  They can't be those  rinky-dink beginner songs.  Well, then, you know what?  We don't have to play  rinky-dink beginner songs.  Whatever you require.  Why don't we just go to expert? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  I say so, yes.  Yeah, but there's still  lesser experts.  Yeah, so we could take  a rinky-dink song  and play that in expert  and it's going to be hard.  Okay, all right.  Well, you guys will be in agreement.  Maybe we put them in the hat  and you pull it right out.  Oh, I like that idea.  It's definitely fair.  That would be fair  for everybody, right?  Sure.  There's the great Billy Mitchell  on the screen right now.  That's the kind of shit  you're going to be dealing with  after I beat the piss out of you.  Look at it.  Danny.  You want to fuck with that?  Danny.  You want to fuck with those jeans?  Billy Mitchell.  You want to fuck with that hair?  You're not Billy Mitchell.  Hold on, hold on.  You're such an asshole.  I got an idea.  I know it's radio,  but for tomorrow, 
[02:46:00]  could you try to dress  as close to Billy Mitchell  as possible?  Can we somehow get  the USA tie for you?  Does anyone have a USA tie  they can bring in tomorrow?  Looks like someone  isn't napping today.  I will do my best  to emulate my idol.  Can you get that look  going, you think?  I will try my best.  You could borrow a pair  of my jeans  because they'll probably  be tight enough.  Actually, I think I have  the perfect pair  just in mine I have  at my house.  Can you straighten  your hair for tomorrow?  What's that?  Can you straighten your hair?  That might be a little  more of an accomplishment 
[02:46:30]  than some tight jeans.  You can wet it down  a little bit.  You've got to give  the thumbs up.  Oh, yeah.  I'll take that exact pose.  I'll just point to  one of the Guitar Hero controllers.  Bring some of my sauce  for everyone.  It's not going to mess up  your gameplay, though, right?  No.  If anything, it'll be like  Billy's in me.  It'll inspire you.  Yeah.  Billy's in you.  It's just what I've  always wanted out of you.  Yeah.  Won't do you any good.  Hey, I've got a fish  name after him now.  Go for your fish.  That's right.  You have a Billy Mitchell  fish.  Yeah, I'm going to say  hello to Billy Fishel.  Hi, Billy.  It's Billy Fishel.  Billy Fishel.  I'll feed you when I get home. 
[02:47:00]  That's cool.  Sounds like a missile.  This is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  Fuck.  Sirius XM.  Listen, I think  Jason Ellis is standing by.  Jason.  Yes, mate.  Sorry about that.  I mean, you were supposed  to call about an hour ago,  but we're in the middle  of one of those weird  fucking shows.  We're way the fuck behind.  You do whatever  the fuck you want.  You're the fucking dude  that's a millionaire,  and you've got your own  fucking channel,  and you just fly around  fucking chicken jacking off  on fucking iPhones.  You go ahead  and do what you want. 
[02:47:30]  I'm scum of the earth,  and I'm on my way,  so you just fuck me over royally,  and I'll enjoy myself.  Don't even worry about it.  At least you understand,  right, Jason?  And Anthony,  if you want to get  something that Ticketmaster,  you can fucking come see  Ellis Mania at Ticketmaster.  They'll still sell  those fucking things  because nobody fucking cares  because we're shitbags.  Wait, what's happening?  You're doing an event,  and no one's buying tickets?  That can't be possible.  You've got a huge following.  It's not sold out.  Oh, you want the big sellout, right?  Yeah, I want people  to freak out.  What do we got going on?  It's an Oktoberfest? 
[02:48:00]  It's Oktoberfist.  Well, they fucking wrote  Oktoberfest.  I'm like,  It's because they're morons.  I'm like,  who gives a shit  if he's drinking beer  with Germans?  I don't even drink.  I hate Germans.  That Duhas band  makes me want  to fucking shoot myself.  Duhas.  Duhas, meh.  Meh.  You're lucky  I don't have a gun right now.  We love that Duhas.  You do, really?  It just makes people angry.  I don't know.  It's one of those  marching Nazi music.  It's supposed to make you angry.  There you go.  There you go.  That song is supposed 
[02:48:30]  to make you angry, Jason.  Yes.  Oh.  That's the scene.  No, okay.  So it's Oktoberfest.  That sounds way more exciting  than an Oktoberfest.  As in punching somebody  in the fucking face  with your fist.  That's what it's all about.  Everlast is on Friday night.  Then on Saturday,  Ellis Mania,  the fight song  where there's three dudes  blindfolded with electric  dog collars on their necks  and they're fighting  each other blindfolded  while I electrocute  the fuck out of whoever  is doing really good. 
[02:49:00]  Holy shit.  Everyone's getting electrocuted,  but it's really good  because I tried it  before Ellis Mania 3.  If you wrap it on,  if you turn it up high,  I don't know if it hurts  because I'm not wearing it  because it's Ellis Mania,  not whoever this  cocksucker mania is.  Right.  But they actually  sort of have a spasm  and their shoulder blades  lock up so they look like  they're pretending  to be a chicken  while somebody else  punches them in the face  blindfolded.  It's pretty fucking funny.  I think Anthony's thinking  the exact same thing  I'm thinking.  Do you have the same 
[02:49:30]  fucking lawyers  as we do?  Are you able to do this?  I'm not really on the radio.  No one's listening to me,  assholes.  Hey, look,  take the good with the bad.  I'm a scum of the earth  and I can do anything I want  because no one's listening.  All right, Jason.  No one cares.  You're making a good point  and I'll tell you.  Enjoy your time  off the radar  because eventually  you will be on the radar  and they'll say no  to every single thing  you did to become popular.  Because that's the stage  of the career  we're at right now.  Everything that got us  to where we are,  we can't do anymore. 
[02:50:00]  The difference is  between you and me  is I was already  massacring myself  before I got on the radio  so you can't take  my massacring job  away from me.  I broke bones  and knocked myself out  for 15 years  before I got a job  on radio  so you can't say  that now  that I'm the  Jason Ellis show,  I'm not allowed  to smash myself  and my friends.  That's illegal.  Well, let me explain  something really fast.  Hold on, Jason.  Let me explain.  We were to a point  we can't get  porn stars in here  to insert stuff  in their vaginas. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, I got a porn star  to put a phone  in a porn star's ass.  Nice.  Did you try to ring the phone?  We did that bit.  No, of course I rang the phone  and I thanked my mom  through her ass  on the radio.  There you go.  But that was before,  this was two years ago  before I was even allowed  to be on the radio.  I was just illegally  doing that.  Now, I'm not allowed  to insert anything either  so I'm with you guys.  Alright, so the  dumb insertion thing  is off limits  for satellite radio  radio shows.  It is fun.  It's really weird 
[02:51:00]  that it's fun  that it's on the radio  because most people  aren't seeing  that it's actually inserting  but they can hear  the joy in your words.  Of course,  everyone chuckling  and having a great time  inserting things.  I completely agree.  Let's take it  another step here.  On regular radio  they told us  this insertion thing.  So Ant and I,  we go,  alright,  you know what,  we're going to fucking,  and we were doing this  to prove a point,  we're like,  we're going to make believe  we have a naked girl  in the studio.  The fucking lawyers  actually sat us down  and said,  you can't even make believe 
[02:51:30]  there's a naked girl  in the studio.  And I'm like,  how does that get  anyone in fucking trouble?  I mean,  we would never do  dishonest radio like that  for our listeners,  but still,  we were making the point  that these lawyers  are fucking out of their minds.  It's just old people, man.  They just don't get it.  That's why they shouldn't  be allowed to vote  when they're 65.  That's the cutoff point.  Just shut the fuck up  and go smoke some weed.  Video games are awesome.  You know what I mean?  When you're 65,  get high,  play video games,  shut the fuck up.  It's my fucking time  to do stuff.  You just leave me alone.  When I'm 65,  I don't want you  to listen to me at all. 
[02:52:00]  Don't worry,  because guess what?  I don't want to fucking  tell you anything anyway.  I just want video games  where I can pretend  I'm some sort of  sword dude  and I want to jump off stuff  and shoot people.  You know what I mean?  Have a video game  where I get hookers.  It's all fucking clean fun.  Just shut up.  He can get away  with more though  because he has an accent  and when you have an accent  you can get away  with fucking acting.  It's not my fault.  I was just born there.  Yeah, I get that one.  Yeah, Rich Foster.  That thing you were saying,  I remember the first time  I was on your show,  when I got off the show,  I heard the replay  and you were saying, 
[02:52:30]  oh, so much.  He's so into it  and he's so energized.  He has no idea  what he's in store for.  Right.  And I really,  I was like,  what the fuck  do these guys mean?  Right.  And now,  because I've got  Ellis Mania,  I've got my band,  I sing,  I'm fucking knocking out  some cocksucker from MTV  and then right after  I knock that cocksucker out,  because he's got a TV show,  he shouldn't have a TV show.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm way more amusing.  I don't know who you're fighting.  Andy Bell from Nitro Circus.  Okay.  You watch Nitro Circus? 
[02:53:00]  I do not.  Right.  You're almost done.  You realize that?  I know.  You don't watch Nitro Circus.  It's men smashing shit.  Okay, that's good.  Doesn't tantalize you in any way?  I'm going to take a peek now.  Check it out.  One of them has tits  and smashes shit.  Now do I have you.  What are you talking about?  I already have tits.  Is it a guy that has...  One's a girl.  Oh.  Sorry.  A vagina.  Sorry.  Let me clarify.  Yes.  Yes.  A clitoris  and the,  you know what I mean,  the whole thing  that goes in there  behind that, 
[02:53:30]  whatever that other stuff is.  A fucking hymen.  Yes.  I feel like I'm talking  to my mum now.  How's it going, mum?  And I have a joint.  Oh, no.  Aye, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but I'm going  to knock him out  and then I'm going to sing  so that means I've been  doing rehearsals  for Taint Stick  and training for this fight  and radio  and dealing with people  that are...  Because the more  I'm on the radio  the more the people  are like,  yeah, can you not do this?  Can you not do that?  I'm like, well,  no, no.  I can do everything  or you can fuck off 
[02:54:00]  because I don't  I don't really care  about anybody.  You just shut up your ass  and I can just go  fucking make a video  of smashing shit  and I'll be okay.  Right.  And now I can tell  because now I'm in  I'm stuck in this thing  where I'm like,  I've got to go,  I've got to go,  I've got to win,  I want to beat everyone,  I've got to be the biggest  thing in radio.  What are you going to do  to do that?  And now that I actually  can see what you've got  to do to do that,  by the time that I am  really famous  and rich like yourselves,  fuck off.  What the fuck do I want  to fucking talk to you  about anything?  Why do I want to say 
[02:54:30]  anything for four or five  hours to fucking anyone?  I've already had to  fucking talk my fucking  bullshit to some  cocksucker all day  about letting me say fuck.  See, you get it.  We don't talk to management.  I completely get it.  All right.  We don't talk to management,  we don't talk to lawyers,  we just do our show,  do the best we can  and we get the fuck  out of here.  I'd just like to say  thanks to Steve Blatter  though,  just in case he doesn't  think,  I hope Steve Blatter  doesn't think that I'm  actually directing this  conversation at him.  I'm just saying the man  in general.  You've got to know  how to work that too,  Jason.  Let me give you a lesson. 
[02:55:00]  You motherfuck these  guys like crazy  and then when they  look you in the eye  you go,  you know what,  that was for the show.  You know that.  The average guy out there  doesn't like their boss  either,  so that's all we're doing.  We actually respect you.  You've got to do that  shit when you see it.  Yeah.  I want to punch everybody  in the face though.  I know,  that's why we got you  on the ISDN line.  It's safer this way.  Not you guys,  I don't want to punch you guys.  You're the only guys  that actually like me.  Yeah,  I like you.  Oi.  You're the only guys  that liked me  and then didn't say 
[02:55:30]  later on that I was  a cocksucker.  So,  you know,  I really like you.  You and Pharrell,  that's it.  That's all I remember.  Pharrell's a cocksucker.  Fuck Pharrell.  I ran it to him  and we kind of made up  a little bit.  I still think Pharrell's  a douche.  You don't like Pharrell?  Nah,  shut the fuck up.  We fucking...  Cunt.  You're like a cunt?  I hate Pharrell.  I actually ran into him  and we kind of made up  a little bit.  It's very confusing,  Jason.  I don't have a problem  I can't do that.  I can't do that.  I'll go with you 
[02:56:00]  on the fucking love sponge  but I'm not going with you  on the Pharrell.  I like Pharrell.  You don't like that  big fat mess?  No,  because he changed  his mind all the time.  At one point,  I was a fucking cool guy  and then when I moved  to the same time slot  as him  and everybody realizes  that really,  if you listen to radio,  I am far more superior  than this fucking blob.  I can tell you this much.  And then he talked shit  on me and tried to bury me.  Now we're patching  things up again  and I think after  the last five words  I just said  we're enemies again.  Oh, good.  Wait till Pharrell  just turns around  and stabs you in the back. 
[02:56:30]  Pharrell has never done that.  And he hasn't done that  until he does.  He is my boy.  Alright,  I'm just saying,  you know,  until he does.  I'm just saying.  When he does,  at least you're,  you know,  you're a big guy.  Ellis Mania 5.  Anthony versus Pharrell.  Smack him in his face.  You don't like Pharrell still?  He's a dick bag.  Chicken, chicken, chicken.  Ah, we're going to be  talking about this.  Chicken, chicken.  Alright.  I don't understand  why you're competing with him.  He's a sports show.  Nah, I'm not competing with him.  It has nothing to do  with competing.  You just don't like the guy? 
[02:57:00]  He dog-dicked us.  What does a dog-dick mean?  He dog-dicked us once.  What does he do?  He's fucking, uh,  talked shit.  Let's get it off your chest.  Come on.  He talked shit about us  when we said nothing.  I heard him on the radio  saying he lied to you guys again.  Yeah, well, that's this week.  Yeah, just like you,  though, Jason,  it does get confusing  because we came to  satellite radio  and Scott was, like,  motherfuckering us  and we're like,  wow, we didn't say shit  about him.  Yeah.  Maybe it was a stern thing.  And then, of course,  we attacked him.  Yeah, because that's what...  It probably was,  but you know something?  Who gives a fuck  who's working here? 
[02:57:30]  And what?  Swinging the...  You gotta, like,  come over to Sirius  because we were at X7 at the time.  Yeah, but obviously,  I can understand in a way.  I swing from Tony Hawk's nuts  and if you come on  and you are attacking Tony Hawk,  then I'll come at you.  It wasn't even that.  It was like...  Wait, I want in on this.  This is what happens  to a lot of people.  And you know what?  I don't feel like naming names,  but it's very obvious  who the people are.  Like, they get in Howard's corner  and then feel like  they have to, like,  fight Howard's battle and shit  instead of continuing  to be an individual.  Yeah.  Like, be yourself, 
[02:58:00]  be an individual  and make it on your own.  Everyone latched onto his teat  when they came over here.  I do understand that.  I have said that I like Howard Stern  and you guys in the same sentence.  No, it's fine.  Your fans are like,  what the fuck?  How is that even possible?  And I'm like,  what do you mean?  You know, it's fine to say  you listen to Howard,  you like Howard and everything.  It doesn't mean...  But if you're Pharrell  and we've been working  at the same radio stations together  and had him as a guest  and on the phone all the time  and been friendly with him,  been out drinking with him,  whatever,  and then he comes over here 
[02:58:30]  and, you know,  starts sucking on Howard's teat  and then just starts  dicking us  and bad-mouthing us,  he could go fuck himself.  Wait, let me tag  what Anthony's saying  because all of a sudden  people like that feel like,  well, now that Howard  has taken me under his wing,  I now have to be  this motherfucker  toward O.P. and Anthony  instead of like,  why don't you just continue  being an individual?  And the other thing  I want to say  that came up in this,  Jason, believe it or not,  and this will surprise people,  when you say stuff like,  I like O.P. and Anthony  and Howard,  I actually respect that. 
[02:59:00]  I do.  Right.  Because it's probably  a dangerous thing to say  because one of you  might get offended by it.  No, I respect that.  No, I really don't hear about that.  That's how you feel  and that's what you said.  I do respect that, okay?  That's fine.  I mean, what Bubba did  is an embarrassment  to himself in radio.  I mean, this guy  fought Howard tooth and nail  and next thing you know  he's kissing his ass like that.  That is embarrassing.  That is embarrassing shit.  He could have continued  being an individual  if he believed in himself  in his radio show,  but he felt once again,  well, Howard is accepting me  so now I gotta like, 
[02:59:30]  you know,  lick his fucking taint  and then I gotta take on  O.P. and Anthony  and everyone else  that still don't like Howard.  That's some lame ass shit.  I think every guy  would be the same  and they would have respect  for somebody who just did  whatever they were doing  and didn't change anything  no matter who they worked for.  That's Pharrell down  some fucking Jameson  and call a minor league  hockey game  for the rest of the life.  O.P., are you cool?  Hey, are you cool with Pharrell?  You know, I...  Are you about to change  your mind as well right now?  This is so fucked up, dude.  You're really fucking things up.  No, honestly,  this is what happened. 
[03:00:00]  I like that dude.  I really like that dude.  He's actually been  a good friend of mine.  Hear me out.  I walked through  the Sirius XM studios  at night one time  because I live, you know,  in Manhattan,  so I stopped by later on  in the afternoon sometime  and I saw him  and I go,  I thought you were supposed  to punch me in the face  and then we talked  a little bit  and he explained why  he did some of the things  he did.  I was like,  all right,  but at least you're explaining it  and we did hug  and do a shake it up  and we went our own ways  and I haven't thought  about him since.  It's the same as he hates Dana.  Him and Dana White  had a fall now.  I'm good friends  with Dana White.  I ain't gonna fuck, 
[03:00:30]  you know what I mean?  I fucking love Dana White  because another guy  that speaks his mind  and doesn't like  change his tune  because of who's liking him  that day.  That's what I like  about that dude too.  He's got the UFC  on this Saturday as well  but really,  no offense to Dana White,  Ellis Mania  is really where it's at.  That was smart, Jason.  Yeah, going up against...  Fucking hell,  I didn't know,  God damn it.  Going up against UFC,  that's real smart.  It's different.  This one's got...  Okay, well then  check this out.  Does Dana White  have a fucking pawn  and start fighting a dude? 
[03:01:00]  Hey, that's pretty cool.  In your face, White.  The Odomichita drinks piss.  My fighter drinks  fucking mad loads.  24-7.  She's a whore.  She is.  Is Machina a whore?  Who's the fucking dude?  Fuck Dana White.  I've got no hair as well,  God damn it.  Who's the fucking dude  fighting the porn star?  He's just my boy  that like has...  He's got like a...  He never rode a bicycle  and he can't...  He's just one of these people  that's like...  I taught him how to...  I don't say retarded.  I would say a fucktard  or mentally challenged 
[03:01:30]  because I don't disrespect  the mentally challenged people.  Thank you.  But I would say  that he's more of a...  The easiest word  would be pussy.  He's throwing in a hot shot there.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's just a pussy  and he doesn't know  how to bounce a basketball.  I just taught him  how to ride a bike  for the first time  the other day.  He's one of those people  that plays chess.  And you can't...  Oh, okay.  And you can't believe  why people in Vegas  aren't going to see this  and are going to Circus Olay?  Circus Olay is fake.  This is real.  Somebody's going to get  punched in the face.  I'm going to fucking  really beat the shit out  of this dude from MTV. 
[03:02:00]  I believe that.  Go to a fucking crap table.  Hold on.  I want to hear more  about your friend.  Does he have a hint  of a muscle on his body?  No, not at all.  He actually started  to work out  and he decided  to take a bunch of protein  which didn't work out.  So now he's 130 pounds  but he's just like  a little fat skinny dude.  Is his last name Norton?  You know what?  It would be a close fight  but I think  because Norton's got  that weird emotional  psychopath side to him.  And you can't hit him 
[03:02:30]  in a chin.  You don't know how to  fight psychotic, right?  When people are psychotic  they're unpredictable.  This guy's a pacifist.  Hey, have you been  teaching him  how to fight abroad?  No.  Any pointers?  No.  I told him to cheat.  I told him when they  touch gloves  that he should run away  and bounce off  the turnbuckle  and then clothesline  the bitch.  Yeah.  I think she's  4'8".  Jesus.  She's 94 pounds. 
[03:03:00]  Joanna Angel  if anybody wants  to check her out.  I think it's  JoannaAngel.com  She actually will  masturbate for you  live on the internet.  I'm very excited.  Uppercut to the vulva.  Why would you teach her  to fight abroad?  If you can't fight  in this country  why would you be able  to fight in another country?  It's Ellis Mania.  Anybody can fight everybody.  Well you just say  how you teach her  to fight abroad.  There's two dudes  that are fighting each other  with one arm  duct taped to their side.  Fucking hell.  What else is going on?  Hey Jason  be careful with that  blind boxing.  We did it.  You did do it? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Not with a blindfold  but real blind people.  No shit.  Oh yeah.  No listen to this.  And I think if you YouTube  you can find our blind boxing.  What's amazing about  the one guy  comes in  he pops his eyes out  to prove he's blind.  He fought this guy  Blind Dave  who rules.  He did a lot for our show.  Blind Dave was a trooper.  The other guy  knew how to fight.  Blind Dave walked away  with what were  all the injuries  and this is what  you've got to be  careful about.  Broken ribs  ruptured spleen  ruptured spleen  wow  and there was 
[03:04:00]  something else.  Yeah something  was wrong with his jaw  I think.  Yeah the doctor  basically said  that he could have  died.  Yeah well he's a  pussy a blind pussy  at that but these guys  these guys actually  know what they're doing.  I have professional  fighters that are  in corners  and a referee  and really  these like  Joanna Angel  as we said  is 94 pounds  and raw dog  is a humongous  vaginal cavity  so these dudes  could go to town  on each other  for fucking 20 minutes  and nothing would happen.  The only real fight  with any danger  is me and Andy Bell 
[03:04:30]  because Andy Bell  is a motocross guy  he's an MTV guy  you know he's the  Nitro Circus  friends with Travis Pastrana  and all that so  he doesn't care  if he gets knocked out  and I don't care  if I get knocked out  so that's the real one.  The other ones  if somebody gets rocked  because I mean  I've had a pro fight  I know the deal  somebody gets rocked  and it's game over  you get to sit down  and have a beer.  You know  I'm not going to be like  finish him  you fucking pussy  Finish him!  One more thing  Fedor  Did we talk about this 
[03:05:00]  on our show  last time you were on?  What did he kick me?  Yeah  Fucking Fedor  was on Jason Ellis' show  we had Fedor on  and we were scared  Did he kick you?  Fuck no dude  You know why?  You got a Porsche  don't you?  No no Porsche  I'm not a car guy  You got something  that simulates a Porsche  I got a nice apartment  in the clouds  I want your fucking  apartment open  You'll get there  You will get there  Yeah but I don't have  but I'm worried  this is the thing  especially after I heard  your fucking  replay that day  I was like  I don't want to make it 
[03:05:30]  and when I  because I  you started younger than me  by the time I make it  and I get my paycheck  I'll be flat  when everybody starts  listening to me  I need to do it faster  so I need TV shows  I need fucking  massacrists  to kick me in the leg  I need death  almost death  so everyone's like  who is this moron  let's listen to his show  and then I'll be  like I have money  and still fury  before I tap out  of five years of bullshit  Does this bring back memories?  Ah I love it  I don't want to hear it 
[03:06:00]  When I hang up  do not fucking say that shit  Does this bring back memories then?  A guy with ambition  and fucking motivation  How do we get the whole city  to talk about us today?  That's great  And then we end up  unemployed for a while  It's fantastic  You have to get fired  that's a biggie  If you're going to make it  in this business  you've got to get fired  once for something  really good  Really stupid  And you've got to  sit out a good year  Check it out  Tell Vasa about  You're a fucking asshole  I can't let it go now  You're such a fucking asshole  I can't let it go  that cocksucker 
[03:06:30]  Fuck come on  Stop it man  Fuck him and his asshole  Not fucking him  I think we were surprised  because his trashing  came out of nowhere  based on not much  I can understand your angle  but I can't do it  Like I said  I did a shake it up  with a little like  fucking  like handshake  You're such a fucking asshole  and then we  I haven't seen him since  He can't stop  Yeah Opie  you're the fucking asshole  because you actually  fucking patched shit up  and now you're letting  your boy trash him right now  If I had my show  you know what  I'd let somebody  trash somebody  You've got to look  at something called 
[03:07:00]  Ant knows what I'm going to say  Yeah I know  Good cop and bad cop  Yeah  It'll get some things  done for you  Good cop bad cop  You know what  My guys  My guys are always  My guys are always good cop  so I'm just always  the cocksucker  and I think everyone else  is more worried  about their job than I am  The key is  you've got to switch roles  You've got to be  bad cop  and then the next day  you confuse everybody  and you're the good cop  Telly  Telly why don't you  fucking start telling  everybody that they suck  so that I can be like  dude you've gone too far  Right there you go 
[03:07:30]  Can you get on the  fucking radio tomorrow  and annihilate Love Sponge  and be like  dude the guy's just  a little chubby  give him some fucking  Fucking bullshit  I always have to do it  and go down with the ship  Before we let you go  and get the big plug in  you've got to  retell the Fedor story  Jason isn't  he's definitely insane  he's not just talking  a good game  Rich Vos  Fedor  you know Fedor  well he should be  in the UFC  but he's not  now he's fighting  for CBS  for free  or whatever  selling heroin  to the Russian mob  whatever it is  but he should be  in the UFC  I was just reporting 
[03:08:00]  that from my producer  he said  oh shit  because I completely  disagree  that there's any  mafia involved  whatsoever  what's the mafia  exactly  so we had Fedor  and we just  we just talked to him  Jason goes  fuck that  I want Fedor  to hit me  so we had Fedor  kick him  I think twice  he didn't want to  I was trying to tell him  because you know  he can't speak English  so I was saying  fucking kick me  will you kick me  and he was like  no I will not kick you  because you know  whatever dude  telling him  this moron  wants you to kick him  and then at one point 
[03:08:30]  I was like  dude I've had a fight  I'm not going to sue you  tell this guy  that I'm a crazy guy  and I don't give a fuck  what he does  wail one on me  it'll be  you know  it's a childhood dream  some bullshit like that  and then he looked at me  from the other side  of the table  and I was like  come on dude  and I know  he might not know  that the word  come on  but I was like  come on  fucking do it to me  you know  fucking hook me up  you prick  and then he was like  alright I will do this  so then we go outside  and then he gives me  a leg kick  and I'm like  come on motherfucker  like  fucking wing one 
[03:09:00]  you know what I mean  like this is bullshit  make it count  so  he winged one  he didn't really give me  a hundred percent  but he put one in the bone  or whatever  it wasn't that big of a deal  but the second one  because I had to kind of  get angry at him  to make him do it  and then he kind of  just because you know  who he is  he kills people  he's a naturally gifted  killing machine  and our eyes locked  and he was like  okay  really  and then looked at  the part of the flesh  where he was going to kick  and I was like  wow  this is really going to happen 
[03:09:30]  this is going to be  fucking crazy  and then for like  two weeks  every time I stood  every time I walked  that leg  when it planted on the ground  I thought  Fado  Fado  Fado  every time I walked  it was a legendary day  for me  and what did you get  out of it  glory  you fucking arsehole  you really are retarded  you idiot  no  are you kidding me  run in front of a  you want a fucking story  run in front of a bus  stupid  and get it over with  just run in front of  I don't get to tell the story  that's a good story  you don't know 
[03:10:00]  who Fado Emelianenko is  do you  I'm a karate guy  that kind of shit  doesn't impress me  a karate guy  a karate guy  stop with the technical jargon  Jason  next time you're in New York  we'll have Vos come in  so you can see his karate moves  they're terrific  it is a good story  I'm just fucking  it is a good story  you can karate kick  Jason Ellis  what's that  he said he'll give you  a free kick  he sounds like a karate guy  I'll give you a free punch  to the face  if you want one  no listen  no you can punch him  in the face 
[03:10:30]  it doesn't even matter  what are you kidding me  that's what I meant  you're talking a good game  I'm not hitting you  he's calling you out  and now you're not  hitting anybody  he sounds like a karate guy  he's too scared to hit me  he sounds like a karate guy  the way he's fighting that  dude he's gonna just  let you hit him  that's what he does  he's not gonna hit back  I drank my piss the other day  he knows Rich's hands  are so tiny  it's like getting hit  by one of those  little Japanese back scratchers  maybe  the piss thing  is supposed to be  very healthy for you  Jason  yeah I know  but it's so bad  you can't do it 
[03:11:00]  I don't know how they do it  what to drink your own piss  drink your own piss  I lost a bet  the last UFC  so then I drank my piss  and then everyone told me  that Leo Machina  drinks piss  because I got a  paid for website  the ellismania.com  and I was on there live  while I was watching  the UFC  making bets  and I don't have any  fucking money yet  so  I just bet  drinking fucking piss  instead  you motherfuckers  talking shit on Pharrell  I'm over here  drinking piss  you cocksuckers  fucking Porsche 
[03:11:30]  driving fucking  new apartment  shiny suit  motherfucker  I'm fucking drinking  fucking my own urine  to fucking make  five bucks a month  off a cocksucker  so anyway  I fucking drink my piss  and then someone  tells me that  if you drink your piss  it's really good for you  and Machina did it  and then I found out  off one of my  fight trainers  that he drinks it  in the morning  so I pissed into a cup  in the morning  and fucking  once again  for ellismania.com  drank my warm piss  with a head on it  that's what I did 
[03:12:00]  that's what I did  you can't hold it in  if you're gonna drink  your own  I don't know how you  if you're gonna drink  your own piss  you don't do the morning  fucking piss  but here's my angle  that's dark yellow shit  once again  once again  I thought  who in radio  because Liam Machina  is the light heavyweight  champion of the world  who in radio  is drinking their own piss  I will drink my own piss  to be the greatest  radio person in life  every morning I'll get up  and I'll drink my piss  to be the champ  fucking change my mind  completely  you're willing to  complexion  complexion  complexion 
[03:12:30]  I didn't slobber on that  no  alright don't turn on me  I'm not fucking Pharrell  what I'm saying is  look  Ant's got the problem  with Pharrell  I didn't turn on Pharrell  I fucking meant Pharrell  I listened to what he had to say  and I gave a shake it up  and we went our own ways  what can I tell you  I can't fight the world  every day  it's getting exhausting  you gotta let some  of these battles go  he said some nasty  asshole things  Ant's not over it yet though  I ain't fucking over it  I probably won't get over it  I don't think he's worth  it getting over  he's not the kind of guy  that I'm like  I could give a shit 
[03:13:00]  if I'm fucking friends  with Pharrell  so it's not like  hey can we talk about  my band and my fight  instead of burying  my fucking friends  you fucking asshole  can you at least do it  when I'm not on the air anymore  you fucking brick  so you're putting him  in a bad spot  but you're not in a bad spot  because I already taught you  and you're not listening  it's a bad cop  good cop thing happening  oh okay  well then hey man  stop it  yeah you let Anthony  do that  knowing that you don't agree  and I don't agree  and then everyone's safe  I understand  you can  alright

[03:21:30]  thank you  thank you for the opportunity  you piss flats  alright there goes Jason Ellis  thanks Jason  this is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show  Sirius XM  it's weird how we look at  like we just  white and black  we just look at things  you know when I first  the first time I realized that  like and I guess  this is naive of me  because I grew up  I stepped on someone's toe  and got stabbed  yes and I said  get the back of the bus  boy  no I was  I hung out with weird kids 
[03:22:00]  my friends as a teenager  I hung out with black guys  from the projects  and I hung out with skinheads  I had like a really weird  I mean talk about diversity  before it was popular  mad man  you know I really had  a fucking bizarre group  of friends  and I remember me and my buddy  Tyler  went to see  I think it was  Do the Right Thing  and at the end of the movie  it's a great movie  Spike Lee  where at the end  Spike Lee is a pizza guy  named Mookie  and Danny Aiello  is the white pizza owner  in the black neighborhood  for anyone who hasn't seen it  28 years ago  yeah spoiler  spoiler alert 
[03:22:30]  exactly  Spike Lee's 70 now  Spike Lee takes a garbage can  because this guy  was Radio Raheem  I think  was choked out  by the cops  so in anger  he was choked out  by misbehaving  in the white establishment  in the black neighborhood  so the fucking Spike Lee  throws a garbage can  through the window  and they burn the black  the black guys  in the neighborhood  burn the white pizza place down  and I was so angry  that they did  like I sided  with the  with Danny Aiello  and his family 
[03:23:00]  like why would they do that  they had been good  to the neighborhood people  and Tyler  he was like  no but I get  why they did that  like  our gut reaction  was immediately split  opposite right  and it was fucking bizarre  to me that somebody  could see it  that opposite  from the way I saw it  I knew we had just  gotten the same information  because we were sitting  in the theater watching it  right you saw the same movie  it was like we saw  the exact same thing  we were handed  the exact same information  there was no spin  I saw how he got it  and he's  and we came to  100% polar opposite 
[03:23:30]  conclusions  so I guess it's like  with stuff like this  you just see it  different  yeah  but that's another thing  people don't want to address  is that in diversity  you get  different opinions  based on your  experiences growing up  and your parents  experiences put on you  and we don't think  the same way  we just don't  but people love to think  we all think the same way  we all have the same ideas  and ideals 
[03:24:00]  in our country  and we as  no you know what  no we don't  some people think  much differently  of the same situation  than others  it's  and for people  to not want to identify that  or if you do identify it  you're called  you know racist  or a separatist  or whatever the fuck it is  but we have  very different ideology  but the funny  and you know what  can you look up  the definition of diversity  because it's very funny  how they talk about diversity  they love that word diversity  and the differences 
[03:24:30]  that make it  but if you come out  and go hey blacks and whites  are different than that  you're seen as a racist  yeah  or if you go  no no well Mexicans  do it like this  and we do it like this  you're a separatist  it's almost like  diversity is bringing  different people together  but if you mention  what's different about you  you're considered a racist  yeah the whole idea  of diversity  is to be diverse  it is many things  many choices  and differences  and uh  the second you talk about them  you're fucked  and they don't want to look  at like the fact 
[03:25:00]  diversity  it's the state  oh okay  or fact of being diverse  difference  difference  unlikeness  unlikeness  variety  multiformity  a point of difference  so  it means different  it means different  so when you  they say  we celebrate diversity  that means we celebrate  our differences  yes  but if you mention  the differences  and I guess  if you don't mention it  in a 100% positive way  you're a fucking racist  right  yeah  they have the deck rigged  where if you don't go  hand in hand  and fucking drink
