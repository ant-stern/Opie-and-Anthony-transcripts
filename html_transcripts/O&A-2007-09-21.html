<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with self-deprecating commentary on their "shock jock" status and listener calls.  One caller described their depression stemming from a refrigerator door falling off.  The hosts discussed their "Miss Pal Talk" online contest, interspersed with reactions to a humorous "face taping passed out dude" video.  Another caller revealed her need to fantasize about women to achieve arousal during sex with her husband, prompting speculation and jokes from the hosts.  The conversation then shifted to Chris Crocker's newfound television show, met with disbelief and cynicism from Opie and Anthony, culminating in an unsuccessful attempt to contact him by phone.  Jill Nicolini, a New York traffic reporter, was also mentioned.  Discussion then moved to alleged photos of Oscar De La Hoya in a cross-dressing outfit and a video of a woman being tasered by police, sparking numerous listener calls sharing their own taser experiences and raw audio of a taser incident.  This segment, punctuated by ribald commentary, involved guests Rich Voss and Jim Norton.

The show continued with a discussion of a bizarre Milton Bradley "Mr. Bucket" game commercial, playing a “beep” game to censor explicit language.  Listener calls followed, one concerning a jammed Mr. Bucket, leading to a discussion of Rich Voss's newborn child and co-sleeping challenges, triggering a debate about parenting styles and sleep deprivation.  A debate about the recency of certain potato chip flavors followed, with Voss revealing an index card listing Jewish inventors, leading to humorous discussion about this habit and the Jewish Defense League.  Stone Cold Steve Austin then joined as a guest.  Before the interview, listener calls and emails, some joking about Voss, were read.  The interview covered Austin's career, early struggles, changes in wrestling, on-screen beer drinking, and *The Condemned*.  It included humorous anecdotes about his WWE career and fellow wrestlers.  A "Tom Alive Friday" check-in with Tom occurred before concluding with further discussions about the show, Walt Disney's alleged antisemitism, and their upcoming appearance in Bananas in Hasbrouck Heights.

The Stone Cold Steve Austin interview continued, focusing on his transition from wrestling to acting, lifestyle changes, workout routines, and playful teasing about his physique and shoes.  A discussion about a hypothetical "swim walking" workout and launching someone through a plate glass window ensued.  The conversation shifted to Austin's fan interactions, bar fights, and arm wrestling challenges, seguing into vulgar and sexually suggestive stories involving a recurring drug addict guest and a gay drug dealer.  This led back to the Oscar De La Hoya cross-dressing photos, with graphic descriptions and jokes.  The conversation then shifted to Austin's FYE signing for *The Condemned*, strategies for managing crowds, and a discussion of a crying wrestling fan video.  A listener called in, claiming the show was anti-Semitic, leading to a heated exchange with offensive language used by both the caller and hosts.

The final segment involved a low quote from Pat for a TV delivery job, promotion of Rich Voss's comedy show, the Miss Pal Talk webcam contest (featuring scantily clad and nude women), listener-submitted techno remixes, and a phone call from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The Rock's interview covered his career transition from wrestling to acting, relationship with Vince McMahon, the use of "The Rock" in his acting career, and memories of wrestling with Steve Austin.

The extended Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson interview focused on his early career, catchphrases, fan interactions, and transition to acting.  Rich Voss, Otto Peterson, Jim Norton, and other unnamed comedians called in.  The conversation touched upon remakes (*Walking Tall*), the challenges of transitioning from wrestling to acting, and Johnson's preference for high-quality action roles.  He discussed *The Game Plan*, drawing parallels between his character and Joe Namath, and promoted the film.

After the interview, the hosts and Otto discussed the Miss Pal Talk contest, marked by technical difficulties and vulgar descriptions of Pal Talk users.  Otto's solo appearance was discussed, along with a crude conversation with Jim Norton.  Renee, an intern, presented humorous internet videos.  A critique of *Back to You* featuring Than followed, with clips and criticisms, and further sexually explicit discussions.  The show concluded with continued discussion of the Miss Pal Talk contest and its technical problems.

The show’s final segment started with a discussion of cupcakes, possibly promoting *Across the Universe*, followed by an arbitrary game involving unseen individuals.  A discussion about a Fox sitcom, a "Latina" joke, and a long laugh track occurred, along with jokes about a missing colleague and perceived whining.  A cupcake was thrown.  The conversation moved to a critique of a television show, featuring offensive language directed at Patricia Heaton, Kelsey Grammer, David Bianculli, and Linda Stasi.  A series of video clips featuring women being abruptly cut off from video chats, one showing a couple seemingly engaged in sexual activity, were shown.

A phone call with Sandy Kane, who claimed to have been raped by Richard Pryor, Phil Spector, Demond Wilson, and other celebrities, followed.  The hosts expressed skepticism, engaging in a protracted and highly offensive exchange.  Kane mentioned a movie about Dolly Parton.  The conversation was filled with vulgar language and sexually explicit content.  The hosts repeatedly called Kane a liar and an old woman.  The show concluded with a discussion of "Miss Pal Talk," technical difficulties preventing the immediate announcement of the winner, and a final discussion about a listener’s video freezing.  The segment was filled with vulgar language, sexual references, and offensive remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like you're the I-man.  I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I got an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  That he's very, very depressed. 
[00:01:00]  Because his refrigerator door fell off.  It made a break for Opie and Anthony.  Stupid Australians.  Whose national hero got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst, the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, good morning.  Hi.  Feeling a little sickly today.  What happened?  First one in a while.  What happened?  Scratchy throat.  Slight runny nose.  Eh.  I'll be all right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:02:00]  I am, uh.  I am the werewolf.  I am the werewolf.  What?  I'm, uh, slowly, uh, the girls are coming to Pal Talk today.  Already got two online here.  Uh, just kind of lounging around.  Right.  Nothing big.  Well, we're doing a Miss Pal Talk contest later on today, right?  Yes.  Later on this morning.  Later on this morning.  But I think, uh, I think I'm going to take into consideration, uh, girls from all day. 
[00:02:30]  All day long.  Why not?  Yeah.  Well, they're slowly getting their, uh, selves together.  Getting their crap together.  And getting their asses into the Opie and Anthony room on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  It's the Miss Pal Talk contest.  Miss Pal Talk.  Which is later on this morning.  We get it.  Yeah.  Wow-wee.  Wow-wee.  Wow-wee.  Oh. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  She's sleeping.  I think we're going to be distracted all morning.  It could be.  But the girls in the Pal Talk room.  Hey, your video of the day.  I'm going to call it.  Unless someone else has a video of the day.  We'd like to give the listeners a video of the day.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's something on the news.  There's some horrific thing that's kind of funny.  Funny and horrific at the same time.  A pile up or a car chase or something.  Helicopter trying to land on a van.  Yeah.  On the freeway. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  It's like that.  Some ridiculous thing.  But I went to break.com and on the front page, there's a video of a guy.  He's passed out.  We've all done the passed out pranks, right?  Oh, your pal passes out and you've got to give him hell.  My buddy Buzzy, when we were going to college, he would pass out right at the bar and he  would have kind of like a white man's very loose afro.  He would pass out at the bar guy?  He was passed out at the bar guy and he grew his hair in such a way he had very loose but 
[00:04:00]  all curls in his hair.  And he would pass out at the bar.  And then we would try to figure out how many, like, you know, drinks, you know, straws  we could get in his hair before he wakes up.  We would be betting.  Must have looked good.  Oh, we'd all get a pile of them and one by one you'd have to carefully put in his  hair until he wakes up.  And he would wake up with just hundreds of them in his hair.  And I'm reminded of that today because I went on break.com. 
[00:04:30]  Front page, there's a guy completely passed out and his friends taped up his face.  Have you seen this video yet?  Oh, my God.  Very funny.  My choice for video of the day, and if you got one, you could trump me.  No problem.  It's face taping passed out, dude.  That's what you put in the old search if you want to check out this video.  But it's on the front page of break.com.  Face taping passed out, dude.  Look at that, Jimmy. 
[00:05:00]  I know it's radio, but he looks like he's dead.  It's like a monster, yeah.  Yeah, he's completely passed out.  And with the tape, they were able to open his eyes wide open.  Yeah, by taping up his eyebrows.  You know, they taped up his nose, so it's pushed all the way up in the air.  Well, you got it to the pig nose when you're taping people's noses up.  Of course.  And then the tape is used to open up his mouth, but his lip is like a little more open on  one side, like he's sneering. 
[00:05:30]  He's doing the Elvis.  Yeah, he's doing the Elvis.  A little Elvis.  Yeah.  Thank you.  How bad is it to leave your eyes open for that long, though?  That's probably pretty bad.  Yeah.  It's all drying out.  Yeah.  So I didn't get to the end of the video.  I was laughing too hard.  And then they put the camera right on his face.  He really looks frightening.  That's like from a horror movie.  It's a really funny video, though, because they start from his feet, and you don't know  what to expect, and then next thing you know, this horrific sight is looking at you. 
[00:06:00]  So that's my pick for the video of the day.  Face taping passed out dude from Break.com.  That is creepy, man.  Isn't it creepy?  And that guy is so out.  You can tell.  Yeah.  You can tell he is just gone.  How drunk do you have to be to not know that your eyes are open?  Really, really drunk.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jessica in New York.  Jessica, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I have a, I don't know if it's a problem or concern, but when I, I'm married, and every 
[00:06:30]  time I have sex with my husband, I have to think of a girl in order to turn me on.  Wow.  And I don't know if that means I am a lesbian, or I don't know.  So, you know, when I'm in the shower, instead of, you know, thinking of a guy, I think of  a girl.  So why'd you get married?  Because it happened after I got married. 
[00:07:00]  I don't think she's lesbo.  How does that hit you after you get married?  What was that?  How does that hit you after you get married?  It seems like you would have kind of noticed this over the years leading up to a marriage.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't know.  I got married at the age of 25, and girls started turning me on.  Afterwards, I guess I realized, you know, I'm attracted to girls.  You ever hook up with a girl?  I love having sex with my husband. 
[00:07:30]  Did you ever hook up with a girl or no?  When I was younger, yeah.  Wait, if you like having sex with your husband, that doesn't sound like you really like it because  you have to think of another girl when you're having sex with your husband.  I don't know.  It feels good.  Wait, are you at all like, here's the thing.  Are you kind of just using your husband the way, let's just say a person could watch porn  and do things by themselves. 
[00:08:00]  Are you kind of just using your husband as say, just like you're doing something by yourself,  but he happens to be there?  Like, are you not connected to him at all in bed?  I never think of my husband when I watch porn by myself or when I play with my husband.  No, no, no, no.  I mean when you're with him.  Do you understand?  I'm trying to talk around like, sometimes when you're with a person and you're fantasizing  all the time about something else, it's almost like you're doing something by yourself  and you're just using another person. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Well, you know, lesbian stories are usually really, really good for a radio show.  She's being very technical.  Yeah, yours sucks.  She's just into girls.  And I also think you're calling from the space shuttle because there's a major delay between  what we said and now she's done.  Oh, she was all embarrassed.  So long.  You embarrassed her away.  That's fine.  And Liddy from Whack Bag, oh, but after putting straws in the guy's hair, did you see how 
[00:09:00]  many of our, of your friends you could fit in a phone booth?  And then Awful Me writes, straws in the hair and fun with marshmallows.  You guys at Geneseo knew how to party.  And then he's like, winky eye.  By the way, the video I was just talking about, face taping, passed out dude.  He's also snoring in that video, I should mention.  Oh, yeah.  Was my question too weird?  I was trying to say it like on Terrestrial without actually saying it.  Yeah, no, I guess.  No, we got it.  I don't know if it was translatable. 
[00:09:30]  But I mean, we could have made something out of that even for like commercial radio.  She just sucked at telling a story.  Yeah, she told like what she had to say and then that was it.  Couldn't get anything else out of her.  Right.  Just like her hubby.  Kent the Movie Guy writes, my video of the day is Chris Crocker's take on the N-word and  how no one is allowed to use it.  It's the most ignorant thing I've ever heard on and they decided to give him a TV show.  You know who Chris Crocker is, right?  Yeah, he's that gay guy.  He's that thing. 
[00:10:00]  He's the gay guy that was screaming and crying about Britney Spears.  Right.  Well, I haven't seen the video of him talking about the N-word.  They gave him a show?  Yeah, they gave him a show.  Yeah.  It's the number one entertainment story today, Jimmy.  See, he's very hot in the news.  What network?  Huh?  What network?  Uh, do we know what network?  Or what cable network, I'm guessing?  I don't know.  Well, can you find that out then?  This guy, of course.  And how dare anyone out there make fun of Britney after all she's been through? 
[00:10:30]  She loves her aunt.  She went through a divorce.  She had two f***ing aunts.  Her husband turned out to be a user, a cheater.  And now she's going through a custody battle.  All you people care about is readers and making money off of her.  She's a human!  See, we're so convinced this is fake. 
[00:11:00]  I would give him a show if it was putting him against a wall and shooting him in the head.  Yeah.  We have a very long shelf life, that show.  No.  One episode.  Highly rated.  Britney Spears alone right.  Now!  I mean it.  I mean it.  Anyone who has a problem with her, you deal with me.  Oh, wow.  She's not well right now. 
[00:11:30]  Leave her alone.  Leave her alone.  What people will do for a little bit of that fame amazes me.  Know what we have to play today?  If you put Chris Crocker in the search, there's a ton of people imitating him now.  I've seen every one of them.  They're really, really funny.  Some of them are kind of lame, but most of them are pretty funny.  They have the blanket behind them to hide the background, and they're just goofing on 
[00:12:00]  him and crying about things.  And there's a lot of leave OJs alone.  Yeah.  They've been doing that one.  Can we get the guys to get some of these Chris Crocker videos that everyone is trying  to make?  That guy, he's pretty good.  That guy?  That's Seth Green.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Seth Green says leave Chris Crocker alone.  I didn't even notice that was Seth Green.  You can't really tell because he's got the heavy eye makeup on.  He's got the makeup on.  Yeah.  But can we get some of these videos?  Seth Green.  Because it's the latest sensation on the internet there.  That's funny.  What you don't realize is that Britney's making you all this money, and all you do is write 
[00:12:30]  a bunch of crap about her.  She hasn't performed on stage in years.  Her song is called Give Me More for a reason, because all you people want is more, more,  more, more, more.  Leave her alone.  You're lucky she even performed for you bastards.  Leave Britney alone.  Please.  It's. 
[00:13:00]  Perez Hilton talked about professionalism and said if Britney was a professional, she would  have pulled it off no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who's going through  a hard time?  Leave Britney alone.  Please.  I really don't understand why that's a sensation.  Eight million views on YouTube, that video.  Eight million views. 
[00:13:30]  We're just doomed.  And it's a development deal with a company called 44 Blue.  Has inked a development deal with Crocker.  That means nothing, basically.  Ah, right.  We've had a few of those over the years, and it leads to nothing in the end.  It's a reality show, though.  They want to, like, they think he's a, we consider him a rebel character, they said.  What?  Rebel?  Against who?  The Bible's idea of sexuality?  What's he compelling again?  So, um, they're talking about how that thing got a TV deal today. 
[00:14:00]  And good old Jill from Jill TV.  Jill Nicolini.  Yes, Jill Nicolini.  Who is all woman.  We still have the TV dedicated to Jill Nicolini here in the studio.  Jill TV.  We haven't talked about her in a while.  She's the traffic girl here in New York.  But lately, she's been doing more and more entertainment news.  Yeah, they got her at the desk.  It's just a matter of time before she's the entertainment girl.  Oh, yeah.  Full time.  She's going to have to sit there in front of that traffic map.  I think they're just waiting for someone's contract to end or something.  But she fills in.  And she was talking about Chris Crocker getting that TV development deal today. 
[00:14:30]  And she didn't know that Chris Crocker was a guy.  Yeah, she kind of screws up.  Chris Crocker's emotional plea to leave Britney Spears alone has more than 8 million hits on YouTube.  I actually got that email to me last week.  Reports say the 19-year-old has signed on for his own reality show.  Crocker is just the latest internet star to make the switch to television.  That girl's scaring me.  I think it's a boy. 
[00:15:00]  No.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, she's scaring me then.  It's like Chris.  Wow.  Chris.  All right, Matthew McConaughey.  She still says shit.  Oh, my goodness.  I got to go to my next story.  Hold on.  I love that this is considered news.  I got to go to my next story.  Oh, my God.  She just called him a girl.  I'm sorry.  I'm a little hungover.  It was Thirsty Thursdays instead of each last night.  Thirsty Thursdays.  It was.  Friday's a rough day for Jill.  Oh, my God. 
[00:15:30]  What?  I love it.  I was out.  Oh, my God.  I almost got pulled over last night.  Yeah.  I was driving home.  Crocker just hung up on Bon Jovi.  Why?  Because we woke him up, apparently.  Huh?  We woke him up, apparently.  Did he go, leave me alone?  I'm trying to sleep.  Leave me alone.  Exactly.  Well, we're still owed our interview.  Tell that frigging jackass to get on the goddamn phone. 
[00:16:00]  You just...  Tell him we insist.  We insist.  That you get your fruity ass on the phone.  Or you're going to have to deal with us.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  Yeah, that's how you get a guest on the show.  Get him on the phone!  That's how you get a guest on our show, by the way.  Yeah.  Tell that, threaten him.  Tell that fruit to get on the show.  Great.  Tell that pansy to get on the show.  Great.  Yeah, I'm sure he's just going to jump right on with us now. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Steve's making the phone call.  I see him nodding.  Tell daddy's disappointment.  We want to speak to him.  Yeah, that we need him on the show so we can make fun of him for a few minutes.  Right.  And then he can go back to sleep.  Steve, what's going on with this?  I think Steve's talking.  Of course.  Thumbs up?  We're not a regular radio show here.  We're big.  We're big?  Of course we are.  Yeah.  The biggest.  All right. 
[00:17:00]  Why is Steve thumbs up?  I don't know.  Well, he's talking to somebody, so.  Just thumbs up.  I like thumbs up-ing.  He's talking.  He's nodding.  He's throwing like a pen up in the air slowly over and over again or some kind of like.  What has he got in his hand?  A stress ball or something?  What are you doing?  Travis?  Well, our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Waiting for the outcome of the phone call.  Steve's definitely talking to somebody.  Let's see if it's this F-A. 
[00:17:30]  Here comes Steve.  All right.  Steve.  Dumping right into voicemail, but I left him a long, very nice message.  All right.  Voicemail.  All right.  Cool.  So hopefully we'll have him on the show today.  So you go, please leave a message after the beep.  I'm not by the phone.  Hey, before we break, we got to let you know about Cash4Gold.com.

We'll be back in just a bit.  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony show.  Are there a lot of guys doing something that most guys don't want to see another guy doing  in the pal talk room? 
[00:19:00]  Well, I think this is probably going to be a heavy, heavy.  This is a day where it's going to be very hard to keep guys out of the room because  it's Miss Pal Talk Day.  Yeah, later this morning we're doing Miss Pal Talk in the Opie and Anthony Pal Talk room,  and I'm getting reports that that is bringing a lot of guys into the room to do some things.  Some things.  What they do in some of the more adult-oriented rooms in Pal Talk, but what are you going 
[00:19:30]  to do?  You know, just don't pop up their cams then.  Are you banning them as fast as possible?  I'm bouncing, but, you know, I've got a show to do.  All right.  I can't sit here and just take care of this, but I'm also trying to find girls and pop them  up.  It's too early.  They're just getting ready.  That's all right.  I like getting the...  They're just starting to do a little wake-up there.  I like watching...  This is why I like watching the batting practice, you know, before the game starts.  Yeah, sure.  See how they're looking.  It's like going down to the paddock area and checking out the horses before they hit the 
[00:20:00]  gate.  That's all.  It's going to be very, very nice later on this morning.  Thank you, Scott M. from HopHog.  Slow news day.  Nothing new with the OJ thing, really.  Nah.  He's just pretty much saying everything is ridiculous and any of the charges.  And he goes back to court, what?  Late August.  Late October, I believe.  The Iran president says he won't push for ground zero visit. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, thanks.  You aren't going to get one anyway.  He says he doesn't understand the big deal.  What's all the hullabaloo?  The reason he's not pushing a ground zero visit is because all hell will break loose if he  shows up down there.  He would probably be killed.  You think?  I think some crazed family member would probably somehow try to kill him.  Yeah.  He's here in the United States.  He's giving speeches at colleges. 
[00:21:00]  He must love this place.  He must love...  They must just laugh and laugh and laugh at this country.  Look at what they let us do.  We crap on them.  We kill their people.  We do that.  And look at what they let us do.  Come here.  We're treated like kings.  Colleges pay us to speak there.  Oh, what is that?  Columbia?  He's going to talk at Columbia University, right?  The same university that just canceled the invitation to the guy who started the Minutemen  because it's racist or whatever? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, because there's a guy, he runs the Minutemen.  It's a border protection group.  And yeah, they wouldn't let him speak there.  Students were outraged.  The racism, man.  But, you know, they let this guy...  But they're not outraged by the Iranian president.  This guy.  At their college?  That one guy they ran on stage.  Yeah.  He did start speaking.  And they overturned furniture, like a bunch of little babies.  Yeah, they just...  A bunch of whiny, no-nothing, panty wastes. 
[00:22:00]  There's an editorial in the Daily News about where they're smashing Columbia.  And they should smash Columbia.  And this guy nailed exactly what this phony university is.  He goes, what Columbians, the university, really want is to be able to say that they,  a very special, very privileged bunch, got up close and personal with a notorious world  leader.  Saw him for themselves right in their midst, like a sick circus act for a strange zoo animal.  That's exactly what it is. 
[00:22:30]  They want to be close to this madman and get to touch him and not get hurt by it.  Look, look, he just spoke, man.  You know, if we could have a dialogue...  Maybe we should just listen to what he has to say.  Yeah, listen to his words and...  When all the time they're just...  Yeah, look at him.  Look at him up there.  Oh, God.  He's not hurting us.  He's not hurting us.  Excuse me.  He was like one of the guys that took Americans hostage in Iran back in 79. 
[00:23:00]  And now he's the president.  Yeah.  He's the head muckety-muck.  And he comes over here and enjoys the freedoms of this country.  And just the thought that he wanted to go down to ground zero and that he can't see why  people were angry.  Sorry.  What bothers me is the fact that he has a Frankenberry hairdo.  His hairdo is enraging me.  Every time I see his hairdo, it bothers me.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  He's a perfect coif. 
[00:23:30]  It's stupid.  He's got those stupid Belushi eye...  He's got a very expressive face.  Yes.  That's why people like him.  Yeah.  He dresses in regular clothes.  He doesn't wear all that garb.  So people, they kind of like him.  Yeah.  They don't feel threatened.  Yeah.  They feel threatened.  They're scary.  It is.  It's like some scary guy.  But then he just comes there and talks and you look at him and go, oh my God, that's  a guy who's just really scary and mean. 
[00:24:00]  He really is just like me.  Yeah.  In other news, Oscar De La Hoya.  We were all over this story yesterday.  Man, they're going back and forth between the website and Oscar De La Hoya's lawyer.  Yeah.  Oscar De La Hoya's lawyer saying these are fake.  This is Photoshopped.  Of course, we're talking about the pictures of him in the fishnet head-to-toe outfit pretty  much with the panties underneath, with the wig on, with the high heels on, wig off.  He took the wig off because then he wanted to put the boxing gloves on, but he kept the 
[00:24:30]  high heels on.  Take the wig.  And then he has a picture where he has a leg up on a bathtub or something.  And some of his, you know what, is kind of spilling out of the sides.  Yeah.  And they're saying these pictures are Photoshopped.  And the website, x17online.com, they're standing by the fact that they are not Photoshopped,  that they are the real deal.  And a lot of people don't understand Photoshop. 
[00:25:00]  They think you could just pretty much superimpose somebody in a situation and you absolutely  can't tell.  Right.  Sometimes it's very hard to tell.  But when you're doing something like that, where you're taking someone's head and putting  it on another body, there are certain ways you can tell certain details that have to  be left out or easily seen as fake.  It's not the case.  And the easiest thing to do would be for him.  And this is the way all Photoshop things have been dispelled. 
[00:25:30]  You come up with the real picture, the actual photo, and then you put it side by side and  go, look, here's the real photo.  And here's the fake Photoshop one.  You could see the face is mine, but I'm working out at the gym or something.  None of those have come up.  Not one picture that was used in these Photoshop's has come up because I think those are real.  It'd be funny if they find one.  They're like, this is the picture of him wearing the fishnets. 
[00:26:00]  This is not real.  Here's the original.  And it's him in a feather boa.  Completely nude.  Did a picture of the girl, I think the stripper.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, she's.  What a dominating, sexy looking, horrible bitch she is.  I would put on woman's clothing.  I was going to say, after seeing a picture of her, you almost understand.  You get it.  You want to be humiliated by her.  That's the girl that took the pictures?  Look at that dominating. 
[00:26:30]  She'd probably make you kiss her feet.  Yeah.  And I'm not even into feet, but I would in a dress.  Probably would.  Yeah.  That's kind of funny.  Here's the story.  From golden boy to golden girl, high heels, wigs, and pink underwear.  Some of the garb allegedly worn by Oscar De La Hoya.  The boxing great, known for his quick hands, quickly countered with a one-two punch, insisting  the pictures are fake, saying, unfortunately, with today's technology, anyone can make any  photo seem like something other than it is. 
[00:27:00]  Come on, guys.  Come on, guys.  If anybody with common sense can tell us not to hold you, his legs, it's not like that  in the rain.  Not that I'm looking at his legs, but it's not like that in the rain.  It's not like that in the rain.  He's a bunch of a guy.  They're fake.  They're fake.  They're fake.  They're showing you there's a bunch of dummies walking the streets.  Well, there's a lot of people that don't understand the software that's out there, like Photoshop.  They don't understand.  They really honestly think you can do things like they show in the movies sometimes.  Sometimes, you know, it's not the case. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Usually, Photoshop's especially like these.  If it's some stripper trying to screw them over or something, it's very difficult to make  a very convincing Photoshop, never mind a bunch of them.  So, in your expert opinion, you're saying they're real.  In my expert opinion, I believe they are real.  Yes, I've done some.  I've seen a lot.  I believe those pictures are real.  And until I see the other photo, the ones where they used his head off of, I'll still 
[00:28:00]  believe it's real.  And this is what the website is saying.  But X17 Online insists the pictures are real and have yet to take them down.  An exotic dancer is claiming she took the shots at the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia back  in May.  I think it's real.  Nowadays, with Internet, anything is possible.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, nowadays.  Nowadays, with Internet. 
[00:28:30]  With Internet.  You know, it's weird.  It's almost like I would be embarrassed, too.  But I was talking to Poe yesterday.  So I asked you Poe as I was walking home.  Yeah.  He was like, uh, the Delahoyer photos.  And I'm like, well, yeah.  And then I told him something that I had heard prior by somebody I knew who allegedly knew  him.  And he's like, really?  I'm like, yeah, but it doesn't make him gay.  This is embarrassing.  But he's like an alpha male.  His job is to punch people in the face.  He's one of the best boxers in history.  And he's good looking. 
[00:29:00]  So it's like he probably can have sex with almost any girl he wants.  So he got bored.  And this is what gets him to where he needs to go is to be humiliated.  But who cares?  So what did Poe say?  Buss.  He said, I said, puss.  Damn.  You just been pwned.  I don't think Delahoy is gay.  Yeah, there's something going on.  He likes hot strippers.  I just think that he's got a weird fetish.  Something's going on in that head, though.  And x17online.com, they're standing by the photos like you just heard. 
[00:29:30]  They feel very confident that these are real or they would have got these off their website  immediately.  He just, that's the, like, you know how sometimes with sex you need some kind of a conquest  or some kind of a weird angle to get you, like, even if you're dating a beautiful  girl, at times you'll look at a girl who's like, and go, I want to hook up with that  because it serves another purpose.  I think that's what that is.  Also, if you take the pictures, any Photoshop picture, and blow it up really big and then 
[00:30:00]  look around the areas that were Photoshopped, you could see, they call it artifacts, a little  artifacting around where they were doing that, where they kind of make it blend in by using  either a little blur or something.  It magnifies that and it looks different than the rest of the picture if you blow it up  like huge.  Right.  And, uh, I don't think there, anyone's seeing any of that.  That's easy.  Why doesn't he have a website dedicated to why these are fake?  Why?  Where is it?  Look, I guess he doesn't want to, you know. 
[00:30:30]  Look, that is, that, look at his head on the body.  It's just, it's his head.  There's nothing that leads me to believe that that was Photoshopped in.  But of course he has to say they're fake.  He doesn't want to have a press conference and go, all right, they're real.  Well, he's going to deny, deny, deny.  Nah, deny.  In this age, that is like, that is a plausible enough explanation.  Oh yeah, because most people don't know.  So you just say, ah, that's fake.  So it leaves doubt in people's minds and that's it? 
[00:31:00]  Uh, someone out there is agreeing with your artifacts, uh, comment.  Yes.  Kent the movie guy.  I went to a tech school for information technology, but minored in graphic design.  You can tell these are super real and yeah, Ant is right about artifacts.  Great.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, uh.  About everything, stop it.  I, uh, I was watching Bill O'Reilly last night because, um.  Steve.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Steve from Pajor.  Ant's basement is filled with artifacts. 
[00:31:30]  More Nazi humor from Steve.  Ah, you just like the era.  I love the era.  We all know you just like the era.  It's just the era.  I'm not a proponent of the violence that took place back then.  Yeah.  But, uh, snappy dressers.  I was flipping around last night and you know the, uh, the taser guy from the John Kerry thing?  Ow, ow, ow guy?  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I can't get enough of that clip. Ow, ow, ow, guy. 
[00:32:00]  So I'm flipping around, and I stop on Bill O'Reilly to see what that dope is up to last night.  Taser me, bro.  Well, that's what I'm getting at. Bill O'Reilly is selling t-shirts that say,  Don't Taser Me, Bro.  Really? Because they're on, like, t-shirthell.com and all the other t-shirt sites.  I guess he's trying to be hip with the youngsters or something.  Is he?  He's trying to get people to go to his website to buy the Don't Taser Me, Bro t-shirt.  He should sell shirts that say, Don't solicit me with phone sex calls. 
[00:32:30]  Bro.  Lest I make you pay me a bunch of money in a settlement that you will not disclose.  Bro.  Don't loofer me, bro.  Don't loofer, yeah. There was a thing with the loofer pad.  Are you recording this, bro?  Bro.  I now can't say hi to any woman in the hallways, bro.  Bro.  Yeah, what a loser, though. Why would you hock that crap?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Anyway, speaking of tasering, we got a brand new one.  A new tasering?  Out of Ohio, baby.  I love taserings.  A woman in Ohio gets tasered until she passes out.  It's this shocking video that has warned city officials in an uproar.  It shows a woman being tasered numerous times by Warren Police Officer Rich Kovach,  who had been called to the Up to the Creek bar back on September 2nd for a disturbance inside the nightclub.  After being handcuffed, the woman was placed in the back of Kovach's cruiser. 
[00:33:30]  At one point, she can be seen trying to kick out the window of the car, and Kovach tasers her again.  Afterwards, the video shows the woman distraught and pleading for him to stop, but Kovach can be heard screaming at her.  Not again, and again, and again.  What do you want?  What do you want?  Because it's starting that cruiser.  Man, I have a feeling the cops love the taser.  Oh, you gotta love the taser.  And what is she doing? 
[00:34:00]  Like, kicking at it?  Kicking out the window.  At the window?  Well, I'm thinking if you get taser.  I've never been tased, but I'm thinking if you get tased, what you want to do is get out of the situation.  You're not thinking correctly.  You know what?  Which leads to another taser.  Once they hit you.  Right.  Yeah, you may start doing things that...  They hit you, you want to jump out a window just to get away from it, which makes them have to tase you again.  Oh.  So it's a no-win situation.  You know what it is?  Just comply and fight it later, because you're going anyway. 
[00:34:30]  You're going to go.  There's no way they're letting you go.  When you fight the cops or try to kick their windows out, you're going to get tased.  That's it.  You don't think if you kick, they'll put the taser away and go, all right, we didn't realize you were going to do this?  All right, leave.  She's going to break my window.  I had to let her go.  I don't know what the mindset of some of these people are.  I think everyone that gets tased should be drunk off their ass.  Because that's kind of the only excuse. 
[00:35:00]  When you're so drunk and belligerent and stupid.  That you just get tased.  Anybody else should realize you have to comply with the cops.  They bring you down.  Then you go through the system.  And if you didn't do anything, that's it.  Then you just plead your case and deal with it that way.  You're not going to settle it on the street, whether you're right or wrong.  It's not going to be settled there on the street when they're holding a taser at you. 
[00:35:30]  You're going to just get tased or pepper sprayed or whatever the hell they decide to use on you.  I think all that logic just leaves your head when that tase hits you for the first time.  You should be tased for the first time.  And the second you see the cop pull out a taser and go, I'm going to tase you, lay down on your stomach, put your hands behind your back, and just smile.  I'm going through my own personal Rolodex.  And thank God the tase wasn't available back in the day.  Because I just feel like I probably would have been tased a couple times. 
[00:36:00]  No, I've done some nasty things.  And I would have got tased for just being stupid.  Jesus.  And then the logic leaves you, and I would have got tased again.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I would never have gotten tased because I never took it to the point.  Once the cops showed up and the jig was up, that's it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm with you on that.  Just stop.  But beforehand, yeah, there were many crimes being committed. 
[00:36:30]  Finally, other officers arrive at the scene, and Kovach removes the woman from his car.  What do you mean?  You're going to rock to that car, and you're getting tasered again.  Rock to that car.  But as she is walking out of the frame, she is tasered again.  Kovach, in his report, claims the woman fell after being tasered again, this time falling to the ground and being knocked unconscious.  City officials saw the tape for the very first time with me this afternoon, and I spoke with them afterward.  Yes, we placed him on administrative leave for a contract that has to be with pay, and I'm really limited to talk about some of the terms of that. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Can cops realize they have dashboard cams already?  What are you guys doing?  You don't continually tase somebody while you're filming yourself.  What's the matter with you?  Put a coffee cup in front of the camera lens.  Throw your hat on it.  Stupid ass.  What was she doing that he tased her again, though?  Walking away? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  I'm just listening.  I want to see the tape.  Yeah, let's go to Shane in the Bronx.  Shane, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I'm a law enforcement official.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if you're 6'5 and 300 pounds or a buck ten soaking wet and 5'2.  As soon as you get tased, you are going to plead for the cop to stop.  I've seen people from both sides, and it doesn't matter.  As soon as that taser comes out, I've seen EDPs completely go comply and go, 
[00:38:00]  oh, God, I'm going to the hospital.  And no matter who you are, you're going to comply with them.  It sucks, really.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Steve in Texas.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, I've got to tell you, DVR is the greatest thing in the world.  I don't know if it's the same video you guys watched, but I have to slow it down.  and watch your head bounce off the taillight of at least a dozen times. 
[00:38:30]  I've got to see it.  Oh, that's funny.  I love these videos, man.  The Taze videos are just unbelievable.  I think we got the raw audio of the first Taze here.  You're under arrest.  Come on out.  Come on out.  Get out of the car.  Get out.  Get out.  There you go.  Hands behind your back. 
[00:39:00]  Hands behind your back.  Hands.  Hands.  Wow.  Shut up.  I can let up on the trigger a little bit.  Did he have to put another battery in?  Right.  Hands, Farman.  It sounds like bacon.  What the F, man? 
[00:39:30]  She couldn't comply to anything but shaking.  I know a lot of cops out there are laughing, but I think there's also a few cops out there going,  and look, you couldn't handle a woman in that situation.  You just give her a zap and then ask her a few more questions.  A quick zap and jump on her.  That crackling was just done.  Yeah.  Is the bacon done?  Bacon.  That's funny.  That's funny.  They have to change the battery.  That's the first one, and then this is the second one in the car.  This is the raw audio.  That crackling was just done. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Keep kicking that window. 
[00:40:30]  She'll get it again.  Stop it.  I love that.  You can't tell if she's in pain or she's screaming at a concert and having fun.  I know.  It sounds like, whoo, yeah.  Lamb of God.  Woo.  Yeah.  That just kept going and going.  That's funny.  He's got a sticky trigger finger.  She sounds like sizzling.  Yeah.  You almost hear the cops in the background going, so what do you want to do after the  shift?  Yeah.  Discussing their plans after they get off.  I need a taser. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, I so need a taser.  This is a good point from Grady in Queens.  Grady, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Come on.  Yeah, by the way, that audio will never get old.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But basically, all you see is the lady getting tased.  You don't see her being a drunken C prior to this.  Probably cursing up a storm.  Who knows what she was doing to this guy?  Dude, cursing up a storm.  He's a pretty big cop.  Yeah, we're looking at the video now, finally.  Cursing up a storm is not an excuse to get tased. 
[00:41:30]  She did try to kick out the guy's windows.  I'm sure she was just probably just drunk.  She was probably sloppy.  I mean, who knows?  One shot is one thing, but he probably just, you know, you can't just taser her because  she's kicking her.  Oh, you certainly can.  She probably should have just peed herself and then went home.  All right, great.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Oh, that's great.  There's a video out there of, because sometimes the camera angle does screw things up.  There's a video of two cops, and you see them come into frame, and they're following 
[00:42:00]  some guy, and then with the guy's back to the cops as he's just walking, the cops open  fire on him and just shoot him in the back and kill him right there.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, like a lot of shots.  And there was outrage, and people were freaking out.  Well, they released the dash cam of the other cop car, and you see it's a high-speed chase  first.  Then the guy gets out of the car with a gun, points it at the cop's head, and pulls the 
[00:42:30]  trigger, and the cop just ducks out of the way in time so his head doesn't get blown  off.  Wait, so the shot went off.  I thought you were going to say that it missed out.  No, no, it went off.  Wow.  He turns around, points the gun back at the cops, and one cop starts shooting.  The second he shoots, the guy now turns away and starts walking, and they just unload on  him, because he still had the gun in his hand, and he had already shot at the cops, and he 
[00:43:00]  was a threat.  And when that video came out, people were like, oh, well, okay, now I can see that's a little  different.  So it's all how you see the video, what angle it's from.  A lot of these things, they can be explained.  Sure.  I got audio of the woman after she finally calmed down.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, this is exclusive audio from the Opie and Anthony show.  I like turtles.  Oh, she sounds fine.  Yeah, she's now fine there.  James on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, man?  I just wanted to say that these cops are a little trigger-happy with the taser thing. 
[00:43:30]  I got hit with the taser about three years ago.  I went back to visit my college for a reunion, and I was pissed out drunk on a bed that I  probably shouldn't have been in.  And the cops came in the room and sort of sized me, because I'm a big guy, like 6'5",  300 pounds.  And I was down cold, and they tasered me under my arm with the handheld taser and blew  me onto the floor.  Right?  For doing nothing at all.  That's a waker-upper.  Wait, that's how they woke you up?  Holy shit, it woke me up.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:44:00]  Watch out, potty.  It woke me up.  It woke me up and knocked me onto the floor, and then they dragged me outside.  They said that it was because I fell in the bushes in front of the room.  And I said, there's no way I could get two prong wounds on my side, like burn marks.  I got pictures of it.  I was trying to put press charges against them, but they were insisting they never even had  a taser.  You know, so it just blows my mind.  These cops are a little too crazy with the taser.  You gotta understand, though, it's kind of a relatively new toy in the police arsenal.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta use it.  Yeah, let them figure it out. 
[00:44:30]  Let them have some fun with it.  It's gonna take a decade or two.  Let them have fun.  I want one for my relationship.  Oh, God.  I don't want to kill my girlfriend, but just to zap her on the floor so she, like, writhed  a little bit and perhaps banged her head would be fantastic.  Just so she sees it your way every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  That snide remark is about to come out, and I just zap her under the arm, and she falls,  and she maybe bites her tongue.  All right.  That's stupid.  Jason, this is a weird angle.  Jason from New Jersey.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:45:00]  Hey.  Everybody's missing the big issue.  Yeah.  My mommy didn't love me enough.  What does that mean?  Now I'm confused.  You don't think the cops got some woman issues, for Christ's sake?  No.  They zap guys, too.  I don't know.  This one's a little weird, because we're looking at the broad, and she looks kind of  like someone you could handle pretty easily.  Oh, yeah?  No matter.  Why handle someone when you could just tase them? 
[00:45:30]  That's what I say.  All right.  The phones are lit.  I guess a lot of our audience has been tased.  So we...  That doesn't surprise me in the least.  We'll take some more of your phone calls after the break.  877-212-ON-A.  And, of course, let's not forget the greatest tase ever.  It's still this clip from the other day.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  Opie Anthony.  Jim Norton.  And now Rich Voss.  Voss.  Has joined the program.  Here, Rich.  Got a bunch of people calling in.  Want to talk about being tased?  Also, we got someone that's very annoyed with us.  Tom in Boston.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Tom.  Hey, man.  Listen, Opie, and I know you guys are in a little soundbite war, you know? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I love it.  It's great.  Yeah.  Opie, you're better than that with the turtles.  It's just incontinent.  It ain't funny.  Oh, boy.  You're better than that.  Oh, boy.  With the turtles line?  Yeah, man.  I mean, you got some great ones.  That just ain't one of them.  Oh, boy.  You didn't call with this, did you?  You didn't like the turtles.  Now I'm going to play it twice as much.  Yeah, you know how it works.  Oh, you really shouldn't have called the show.  You shouldn't have called the show. 
[00:47:00]  Which one do you like better than that?  I got you right where I want you.  Which sound clip do you like?  I like turtles.  Which one do you like?  Which one do you like, Tom?  Okay, go ahead.  No, which one?  What's my favorite?  Yeah.  Werewolf movies.  Yeah, that is a good one.  Yeah, that is still really good.  I like to make werewolf movies.  All right, Tom.  Movies.  All right, we'll fade out this one soon.  I like turtles.  But today you're going to have to hear it a lot because you called.  Thanks.  Let's go to Jason. 
[00:47:30]  A lot of our listeners hung up.  They couldn't wait for the break.  Jason and Randolph, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling about this whole case thing.  I don't think it's a fact that the cops have a new toy to play with.  It's a fact that I'm pushing their chest around and being in charge of something.  I think that these guys were beat up in the school, you know, in the sandbox at school  when they were growing up.  The parents took advantage of them.  And now they got a little bit of a fucking power.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  They got a little bit of power, so they want to puff their chest out and prove that they're  in charge.  Some guys, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Talk about, I'm in charge.  It's my house.  My rules.  You're going to listen to me.  And I get a taste.  This is going to help me prove that point a little bit more extremely.  They did a psych...  Power corrupts.  Sorry, sir.  Absolute power corrupts.  Absolutely.  All right.  We get it.  We know.  But they don't have absolute power.  And they are on some level accountable.  And some of them are corruptible and some of them aren't.  But they did like a great psychological profile of cops.  And they said that them and criminals have a very similar personality makeup, but both  went in the...  I guess to do something that extreme, like professionally or a lot, you have to have a certain personality 
[00:48:30]  type.  I don't like the fact that they just threw out absolute power corrupts.  Absolutely.  Oh, I know.  I don't like that.  So does the buck stop here?  Get a hold of yourself.  Why don't you speak softly and carry a big stick?  Well, go grab a bird in your hand.  It's worth two in your book.  Six or half dozen the other.  Six.  Six or half dozen...  Hold on one second.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on one second.  So absolute...  Wow.  Buck's first words, but just not disappointing anyone.  Absolute stupidity appears absolutely stupid. 
[00:49:00]  What did you say?  Six or one half dozen the other.  Six or one half dozen the other.  Is your father Yogi Berra?  Why?  Six or one half dozen...  Because you just take expressions that are very cliche and you remove parts of them and  then just combine them.  Save time.  Six or one half dozen of the other.  You've never heard that saying?  I've heard...  Oh my God, Rick.  I've heard six of one, a half dozen of the other. 
[00:49:30]  Six to one, a half dozen of the other.  Yeah.  Six to one.  Not six or a half dozen of the other.  Six to one?  Yeah.  Six to one, half dozen of the other.  I've heard six of one.  If you think about it...  Six of one, a half dozen of the other.  I've heard it of.  No.  Because you've got six of one...  Half dozen of the other.  And then a half dozen of the other would be...  What the saying is, it's the same thing.  It's six or six.  I've heard it play like it was odds.  Six to one, half dozen of the other.  Like odds? 
[00:50:00]  Six to one?  Six to one.  Six to one odds, half dozen of the other.  That's what I heard my mom say.  I never heard that.  Six or one, half dozen of the other?  Wow.  Two things.  In the real world, nobody questions that.  But here's the thing.  You know what I learned yesterday?  Do you know what don't look a gift horse in the mouth means?  Do you know what?  Yes, if you hand me a present to close my eyes.  No.  Do you know that?  Do you know what don't look a gift horse is?  Yes, I do.  Because a lot of times, I'll tell you.  Okay.  Horses were typically used to bring gifts to the American Indians because of the anthrax. 
[00:50:30]  I'm sorry.  What do they have?  Wait, wait.  The anthrax.  Smallpox.  Because I meant to say smallpox.  Yeah, that sounds alike.  Smallpox, they would not interact with the Indians, so the horses would actually bring gifts  on their backs on a saddle because they didn't want to interact with somebody with smallpox.  Wrong.  Wrong again.  I made it up.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth means you tell the age of a horse from its teeth.  So you open up its mouth and you look, and if it's a gift horse, don't be, you know, it's 
[00:51:00]  a gift.  You shouldn't be saying this isn't good enough.  So you look at the teeth and see how old the horse is.  First of all, I just thought that you are very smart and you know everything, but it  just hit me that somebody probably just sent that to you on the computer.  No, no.  I used to own horses.  God, do you listen to the show at all?  Anthony used to be a cowboy.  I was a cowboy.  Pretty much a cowboy for a few years there.  In my youth.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I used to rope and ride and shoot. 
[00:51:30]  Well, you were dressing sexy for drug dealers to get a little more drug.  I was racing Jim Canna.  Yeah.  Jim Canna barrel racing.  Yeah.  I do listen, but I must have missed that day.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  I missed a horse day.  Yeah, that is an interesting expression.  That's a lot.  Yeah.  I'd like to get a gift horse and then just knock his teeth out.  I wish I could punch hard enough to knock a horse's teeth out.  How stupid it would feel.  Don't punch a gift horse in the mouth. 
[00:52:00]  The listeners don't even miss a beat ever.  They're now using the Rich Voss method.  You got Coke Logic writing, great minds think a lot.  Oh, right.  I heard that one yesterday.  Never forget.  On a replay.  Right.  It's hysterical.  I'm driving home listening.  I hear the great minds think a lot.  Let's go to Jeff in Chicago.  How did we pound you for that one?  No kidding.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I hope you don't want to tell you you're a genius.  Why?  The little turtle line, I love it. 
[00:52:30]  I was busting up yesterday, and the reason why was that every time you played that turtle  thing, you'd follow it up by saying, I know, I know.  It just had me going.  All right.  Cool.  I like turtles.  Say yes.  I know.  People still enjoying the I like turtles thing.  It's turtles.  All right.  Oh, here we go.  Let's say hi to Scott in New York.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, bud.  Hey.  Hey, Rick.  Don't put all your glass houses in one basket. 
[00:53:00]  Don't put you what?  All your glass houses in one basket.  They're just using the Ridge Voss formula today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I want to get another play out of this.  The Mr. Bucket thing we were playing yesterday.  Mr. Bucket.  Mick Jagger gathers no moss.  Sorry.  I missed one of our contestants, I think.  Yeah.  For some reason.  Not for some reason.  We're doing Miss Powell talk today, so there's a lot of women. 
[00:53:30]  A lot more women, a lot more hot women in the Opie and Anthony Powell talk.  Who is your big window open to?  Fast TM Marie.  What?  All right.  Let me just see.  All right.  And there's Baby Girl.  Who's the other blonde in the white tee?  Sarah J.  Sarah J is lovely.  All right.  All right.  Maybe this wasn't a good idea to do this contest.  Oh, because we're distracted.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to be distracted today?  Well, all I'm trying to do is pop up all the girls in the windows so I don't miss out 
[00:54:00]  on one.  But there's guys with gay names.  So you look and you think, oh, that's got to be a chick.  And then it's a goddamn guy.  Right.  And then I'm going to start bouncing guys with girl names.  All right.  So I'm going to start doing it.  Miss Powell talk contest starts later on this morning.  But Mr. Bucket, we were doing this whole thing yesterday, and we got some positive feedback  on the beeped version of the commercial. 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  I want to play that again.  But first, let's play the original.  This is an actual game for kids there, Rich Voss, from the early 90s.  I don't remember this commercial.  Oh, I do.  My girl said, you don't remember this commercial?  I'm like, no.  Mr. Bucket.  You really remembered this?  Yeah, definitely.  I did not.  Watched a lot of TV.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth, it will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Bucket. 
[00:55:00]  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in, and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket.  From Milton Bradley.  Mr. Bucket.  Doesn't the guy who's doing the Mr. Bucket announcement, the Mr. Bucket, the balls in the mouth,  doesn't he look like he's on a coke binge, and his teeth are grinding?  I'm grinding his teeth.  Mr. Bucket, the goal is he just can't get it that fast.  All right.  We took that commercial, and we put a few beeps in it. 
[00:55:30]  We like to play the beep game every once in a while.  Wee.  And it sounds a little differently.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth, it will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to f***.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in, and Mr. Bucket wins, but look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth, Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth, Mr. Bucket.  Our ball is what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  We're all going to f***, Mr. Bucket. 
[00:56:00]  We're all going to beep.  Mr. Bucket.  I like that beeped one.  I really hate the way it starts off with the noise, and then the way the boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  It drives terrible.  Mr. Bucket.  What a creep Mr. Bucket is.  Just a talking bucket walking around the house bothering your kids.  Shooting balls out of his mouth.  Mr. Bucket sucks, and he's a health hazard.  A talking bucket.  Yuck.  How horrible is that gig for the studio band that has to come in and play the background 
[00:56:30]  for that?  I'm Mr. Boom, boom, boom, boom.  I'm a bass player.  I'm a bass, yeah.  You want to be Geddy Lee, and the next thing you know, you're strumming for Mr. Bucket.  For the Mr. Bucket theme song.  They dub children's voices over here yelling, wee, and wee.  You might recognize this music when your uncle walked into the room.  You know, the background music to Mr. Bucket.  You know, I got greedy.  I was...  Ah, yeah.  You had a great point, and then you just...  And I got greedy.  Well, let's go to Bob in Wisconsin.  Bob, what's up? 
[00:57:00]  Hey, I got a question for Voss.  Yeah.  Hey, Voss, do you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome?  Irritable bowel, did you say?  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't want to be giving that one, though.  Oh.  Sorry, Bob.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  Joe, what's up?  Play on words.  Yeah.  Yeah, I used to have one of those Mr. Buckets, and the balls used to get stuck in his mouth  every morning.  Really?  Now, it looks like there would be a problem with the mechanism, because if you drop it  in the top, it looks like...  Yeah.  It drops it in the top of his skull, and the balls get fired out of the mouth. 
[00:57:30]  But it looks like the balls would get stuck coming out of the mouth if the mechanism wasn't  functioning properly.  Did the bucket call Kenny to help him?  What?  Oh, that was a great line.  You know how I'm going to take it.  No one knows what you mean.  What is it?  I'm trying to figure out.  What?  Maybe you're getting too deep.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You've got to just loosen up and...  Yeah, what happened?  Don't try to...  Don't swing for the fences.  No, he was pretty excited.  He moved forward and everything, and he grabbed onto the console.  He thought he had a good one.  Here's what Voss does with his stupid ring.  He taps it because he's a nervous Nelly. 
[00:58:00]  Just in life, not on the air.  He'll go...  Punch line.  You can always see it like a little...  His ring hit the console.  We just took you inside the show.  Now you'll hear that tap all morning long.  You're right.  You're 100% right that I try to hit a home run instead of building.  Yeah.  I try to...  Instead of...  Yes!  It's the first inning.  I should just take it easy.  Yeah.  And look, because sometimes the strike is...  The ball is...  It's...  What?  It's a strike.  You just got to sit there and look at it. 
[00:58:30]  You don't have to swing at everything.  Thank you.  Or hit a pitch to the opposite field once in a while.  How about that?  How about taking a pitch to the low right corner and...  How about over the first baseman's head into right field for a nice little single?  Oh, blooper.  Or sometimes you have to bunt and sacrifice for the other guy.  Well, you do that a lot.  You certainly do.  But use the bat and stop using your chin and face to allow the ball to hit and just  fall stupidly off of it.  Man, they...  I love voice.  You know, everyone's talking about the tasers now.  Taser's under fire. 
[00:59:00]  Don't take the tasing videos away from us, man.  That's what I...  They're doing a whole story on Good Morning America about the tasers.  That's what I wanted to use on stage.  Remember I told you?  Yeah.  Tase the audience.  Yeah.  That'll help.  All right.  Hey, wake them up.  Hey, why don't we bust a nut with corn nuts?  It's not about anything else.  Go to your room and lock the door.  Cause when you try it once, you'll want to try it some more.  Try it some more.  Size doesn't matter and that's a fact.  It might be small but it's a big impact. 
[00:59:30]  Woo!  Bust a nut, bust a nut.  Grab a bag of corn nuts and bust a nut.  Lightly toasted and hard as well.  Enjoy yourself.  We won't tell.  Corn nuts, an intensely crunchy corn snack comes in seven nut-busting flavors. 
[01:00:00]  Bust a nut at a convenience store near you.  Is that a real commercial?  Steve?  What's up, E-Rock?  We got dumped.  Why did we get dumped?  I don't know.  Of course.  The dump clock's going.  We got dumped.  Why are we getting dumped?  You can't dump out of that.  It's a real radio spot.  Did anybody play for him first? 
[01:00:30]  Used to be.  Huh?  Did anybody play for him first?  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe that should have been run by.  Did he just get panicky down the hall there?  What happened?  He might have thought.  He didn't know.  I mean, someone should have ran it down for him first because he thinks that's a parody.  The key is that's a real commercial.  That's not a parody.  That's a real commercial for corn nuts.  Yeah.  I hated those things.  They barely...  It's terrible.  Oh, did I hate those.  They taste like rotted teeth.  They barely talk about the corn nuts in the commercial, but...  Yeah.  Gives them an excuse to do the slug line over and over again. 
[01:01:00]  That's got to be kind of new because corn nuts aren't that old.  I mean...  Corn nuts are ancient.  Are you kidding me?  All the flavors?  Seven flavors?  1975.  What are you talking about?  What?  No, because flavors just came out recently, like when they came out with like the salt  vinegar.  The salt vinegar material.  Please, God.  Stop his heart in mid-70s.  I can't.  What?  Flavors just came out?  No.  Like how they assorted flavors on different things. 
[01:01:30]  See, you think it's crazy, but like...  I've never hated anybody as much as I've ever hated.  Wow.  You're in rare form today, man.  Potato chips.  Like take, for instance, potato chips.  Okay.  All right.  Back in the day when we were kids, they had barbecued and regular.  Okay?  But all of a sudden, in the last maybe five years, six years, they came out with all  these new flavors, the salt and vinegar, the pickle.  Sour cream and onion.  Wait, wait, wait.  They only...  See, that is recently.  That's not like...  Salt and vinegar chips are within the last five years? 
[01:02:00]  Five, six years.  I wouldn't say that.  They had them in the Old West.  Holy...  Are you kidding me?  Do you really...  You really don't think that flavors...  I mean, flavors have been around forever, but...  Did you relapse?  What?  Did you relapse?  Did you relapse?  Can you...  Do me a favor, Hawk.  Can you Google...  Being a father at 50 years old is killing it, man.  A newborn father.  Father of a newborn.  Oh, okay.  Can you...  Can you Google something about this? 
[01:02:30]  When did...  Somehow find when flavor started.  I get...  I'm going to bet this.  I don't know what year it was.  What?  Can I tell...  But it wasn't 02.  Can I tell you when flavor started?  Yeah, flavor.  When...  Was it Adam?  Yeah.  Bit into the apple?  Yeah.  There you go.  That's when flavor started.  He went, wow, this tastes good.  I'm Mr. Voss.  Dumb crap comes out of my mouth.  Hey, a couple things here.  Let's go to Jim in Pennsylvania.  Jim, what's up? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, I'd like to kill two bosses with one stone.  Jesus, boss, my ears left in the suit.  Flavors.  Flavors.  Boss, flavors are relatively new.  Five years ago, they started, according to...  Yeah.  Five years...  Five years ago, flavors started.  Six years ago, you went into Baskin-Robbins.  They went, vanilla.  That's all we have.  We're not even...  Here's some frozen milk with sugar dumped on it.  Yeah, we don't have even one flavor.  We were licking ice cubes only six years ago. 
[01:03:30]  Home of zero flavors.  Yeah.  31 in five years, not bad.  We're cranking now.  Five years ago, there was no flavor.  Alex from New York City.  Wow, what a revelation.  Flavors have been around forever.  They had an orange tang in the 60s when they sent up the moon people.  Yeah, the moon people.  Astronauts.  Moon people.  Astronauts.  It's catching. 
[01:04:00]  Let's go to Ed.  Ed, what's up?  Wear a SARS mask around Vos.  You just start sounding stupid.  Hey, Rich.  Sorry.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  SARS mask.  Sorry.  Yeah, we're all over the place.  I'm sorry.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, Rich.  I got a question for you.  Is the earth round or flat?  Oh, please.  Please help.  And how's my kid doing?  Good.  Good.  That's all you got?  How's my kid doing? 
[01:04:30]  Hacky bit.  Did you sleep last night?  No.  Not at all.  40 minutes I slept.  Why?  What's going on?  Baby was up crying.  I'm yelling.  I'm yelling and Bonnie goes, you're not mad at me.  I go, partially your fault.  Why are you mad at her?  Because your baby's crying.  She carried the thing for nine months.  Give her a break.  We have an extra room that she can take the baby into and sleep and do whatever.  So she doesn't.  Oh, to keep the baby in your room?  The baby's sleeping right between us.  Oh, my God.  It's over.  Wait.  What do you mean in between you? 
[01:05:00]  You're going to roll over on it.  Yeah.  In between.  Like, she's on one side.  I'm on the other.  Is that normal at that age?  Just to.  No.  What?  Put it in a crib somewhere.  My older daughter still sleeps in between us, but she won't get into the crib or the  bassinet without crying.  You got to train her.  I mean, I don't even have kids.  Dude, you got to.  Seriously.  You got to.  Yeah, we give her a biscuit every time she does it.  No, but I mean, you got to just say, hey, straighten up, kid.  And then you let him cry and cry and cry, and you got to take the pain until it falls 
[01:05:30]  asleep in that stupid bassinet.  A bassinet.  I'm sorry.  Damn it.  I didn't like the fact you would let me touch your baby.  I wasn't going to be poking at it.  Oh, you didn't want to?  When I first saw your baby.  Is that normal?  No.  In the beginning, before six weeks, you have to wash and disinfect your, especially your  hands.  That, you know, because the baby's, you know.  So you're mad at Bonnie because.  No, I'm not mad at her at all.  Because the baby kept you awake.  I haven't.  Yeah.  And she should know better to get the baby out of the room and go to the special feeding 
[01:06:00]  room.  Flop one out and let the kid partake.  And it's so weird watching, like, because my first kid, my ex-wife didn't breastfeed.  And watching her breastfeed, she just lays there.  She has a technique where she'll lay down, like, not hold the baby too.  Like, she's almost, like, leaning on her arm.  Let the kid do all the work.  Yeah.  And just drops her breast in the baby's face.  Oh, that's good.  And, you know, she's watching TV, you know, and it's kind of, like, weird in between that.  It's kind of uncomfortable.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:06:30]  Are you jealous of the baby yet?  Or the fact that his hands are bigger on her breast?  Are you jealous of it?  No, not at all.  She's very cute.  I didn't sleep less, you know.  But even if I had eight hours sleep, I would still say that potato chips just came out with  all these new flavors about six, seven years.  All the new ones.  Than said 1950s flavors have been around.  Relative to Voss, that is recent.  Wait, potato chip flavors?  Than?  Yeah.  Yeah, potato chip flavors.  Oh, yeah, barbecue, but what? 
[01:07:00]  Salt and vinegar.  Salt and vinegar.  Salt and vinegar.  The one you used, yes.  First flavored potato flavor.  I remember eating salt and vinegar as a kid.  No way.  Now that I'm in my early 30s, that's a long time ago.  Salt and vinegar kind of made a resurgence, but it had been around for quite some time.  Yeah.  You heard that recently.  Where did you hear that?  What?  The flavors were new.  Someone said that.  You went, yeah, it turns right.  No, no, no.  Well, because Bonnie said that a lot of the flavored chips came from Canada, like the dill pickle 
[01:07:30]  and the salt and vinegar.  Oh, is she a Canadian that tries to push that whole Canada invented everything?  A couple things.  Dill pickle chips.  Thanks, Canada.  Good.  All right.  Let's say hi.  Thanks.  We give them light and electricity, and they give us dill pickle chips.  Suckers.  Now they're all bragging that their money is the same as ours.  That is annoying.  Oh, is that bug me?  First time in 31 years, the dollars are the same.  Yeah, the dollar and the loony.  What's happening to the U.S. dollar?  I don't understand the economy at all.  The U.S. dollar is just plummeting. 
[01:08:00]  Why?  We suck.  Eh, because we do suck.  We got too much cheap money out there.  That's what it is.  How do we give everybody?  Too much cheap money.  We got to just start burning our money.  Just start burning boatloads of cash.  Just start burning your money at home, and the dollar will go back up.  Tell the Chinese that the dollars they own are worthless.  Yeah.  Why is our money going down the toilet?  I don't get it.  It's not because there's too much printed why our money isn't worth anything.  No.  First of all, they lowered the interest rate, and that kind of hurt us.  That's why Canadians' money got...  Yeah.  Shut up.  The Canadians' money shot up.  Let's go to Jim in Wilkes-Barre before this moment passes. 
[01:08:30]  Make some money less worthy.  Worth anything.  Jim, go.  Hey, boss.  Just want to know.  You don't have to worry about rolling over on your kid.  It's drooling on your kid.  Rounding the kid.  Jesus Christ, boss.  Yeah.  He's basically saying if the kid is sleeping between you two, there's a risk of the baby  drowning from your saliva.  You got to see my pill.  Like, I drink those crystal lights that...  No.  Because you believe in you.  No.  Here's the thing.  And they're so bright.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  It's so... 
[01:09:00]  Five years ago, that would have just been water.  Okay.  I said wait because I'm keeping track of the here's the things today.  Oh, okay.  I've had it with him and his here's the thing.  If you could hit the bell when you hear it too, Ant, that would...  Oh, I would never remember.  Because, Rich, you do this.  I'll try.  You say, here's the thing.  And then nothing comes.  You've been waiting for the thing.  Okay.  And so I wake up after drinking and my pillow is all red and stained and my feet from drooling  redness. 
[01:09:30]  He's drooling crystal life.  It looks like it's my face.  It's my face's time of the month all over the pillow.  Do you swallow it or do you just put it in your mouth and then lay your head and throw  it off?  Just let it drool out.  I know.  I'm just kidding.  Oh.  And we got a lot of parents checking in.  They're saying, oh my God, Voss, not the family bed.  You should not...  No.  Never.  ...start this out with the newborn sleeping with you guys because then the kid's never  going to leave the bed.  And guess what happens?  Guess what happens to you, my friend?  First of all, parents...  No privacy for you and Bonnie. 
[01:10:00]  No privacy.  If parents are listening to you guys, what good parents could they possibly be?  We have a lot of parents listening to you guys.  Good?  Really?  Yeah, we do.  Don't take a personal comment.  You're molding a human being's personality right now.  He just got upset because I talked about his parents' listeners.  Hey, we got a lot of listeners that have kids, yes.  It's time to acknowledge that crap.  All right.  Well, all right.  Here's the thing.  Oh, boy.  Hold on.  Hit the bell.  Yes.  Yes, Voss.  In the beginning. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  And here comes the nothingness that Jimmy pointed out.  He's going to quote the Bible.  Yeah.  Yes.  Go ahead.  It's okay, but when the baby turns like, you know, a couple months, then you got to make  sure it can't sleep.  Or, you know, maybe six months and not sleep between you because then it gets used to it.  Here's the thing.  Bonnie is so loving this baby.  Voss does too, but he's had children.  Bonnie is so enthralled with this baby.  She doesn't want to spend a moment away from it.  She cannot put it down.  You got to see the happiness and joy in her face.  I can never bring that to her.  Or anything in life could you bring that to. 
[01:11:00]  How about a smile?  Could you bring a smile?  Well, could you make someone happy to see you?  Just not a frown.  Bonnie is just so in love with this baby, but you can't smother it in the sense that, because  the kid's never going to want to leave the bed.  I mean, I know that.  I'm telling you.  You got to put the kid out on the steps when it sleeps.  You put it in a crib on the steps and tell it to shut up.  That's how you raise a baby.  You yell at it through the window.  Shut up.  Bad baby.  In the winter. 
[01:11:30]  Let's go to Dave in Pittsburgh.  Dave, what's up?  What's up, boy?  Hey.  Poor Than and his useless break sign.  I know.  It's awful.  You can't have your cake and kill Voss too.  Yeah, you can't have your cake and kill Voss too.  You could have made a better one than that.  You could have said you can't have your cake and do something funnier, which I can't think  of either, obviously.  But that wasn't it.  No.  Kill Voss?  Why?  Yeah, that's not nice.  No, it's not nice.  That's not nice.  I take that as a threat.  Than just threw away his break sign.  He should.  All right.  We'll take a break. 
[01:12:00]  How about that?  That's what we do now.  Let's not forget.  We got Stone Cold Steve Austin checking in today.  Otto and George stopping by.  And The Rock will also be checking in today as well.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We have Rich Voss in studio.  I just heard Stone Cold Steve Austin has entered the building.  We'll talk to him in a few minutes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And man, you get the people reacting out there, Rich. 
[01:12:30]  Instant feedback going crazy.  Just a few that have come in in the last five minutes.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  How long was Rich Voss' oxygen cut off when he was an infant?  Awful Me writes,  What's good for the goose is good for the dandruff.  And Hughes Ladbag, he's a faithful listener of the show.  He writes,  Voss, I have a two-year-old.  My wife and I both have a PhD in genetics.  And unlike you, I could say I did work on a cure for cancer. 
[01:13:00]  Because you insulted our listeners and said there's no parents out there.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  By the way, how about this?  Work harder.  Because we don't have one.  Yeah.  So basically, you're just saying I flopped.  I failed.  I stood in a lab and did nothing.  You should have made a disease, like named a disease, like I worked on a polio.  Yeah.  Something that we fixed a little bit.  Because he didn't have a Jewish last name.  And I have, what's the Jew that cured polio?  Oh, it came out with a polio vaccine.  Who?  Hold on.  I got it written down.  If you have a pamphlet of... 
[01:13:30]  No, I keep a list of the Jews that have...  Of Jews who have done good things?  Different things, yeah.  Does he actually have that?  But he's a bugger.  You need to look it up.  He wrote it down on an index card.  You need to look up...  Polio vaccine, Dr. S-A-L-K.  Oh my God, no way.  What?  I can't read my spelling.  I thought you were checking to see if he was Jewish.  We all know who came up with that.  Dr. A-S-A-L-K.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Everyone knows...  Is it Jonas Salk?  Jonas Salk. 
[01:14:00]  Jonas Salk.  I thought you had it written down if he was Jewish or not.  Okay, do you have who discovered insulin?  No.  Wait.  Not as important.  Yes, I do know.  It's Dr. Diabetowitz.  Dude.  Like, here's what makes me want to set you on fire.  He pulls out a list.  I'm like, this idiot downloaded a list of, like, say, important Jews and just reads it.  He actually wrote it on an index card. 
[01:14:30]  How many names are on that list?  About 10.  What else do you have on them?  We have to ask.  What else?  And why do you have that?  Why?  In case of an argument.  Right.  You can actually go to that.  Look at this shirt he's wearing.  Yes.  It's got a JDL shirt on.  It says, never again.  It's got the big star of David with the big fist in the middle.  And Jews are just embarrassed by him.  What else?  Yeah.  What else you got on your little index card?  Wasserman test for syphilis.  He should be happy about insulin weight.  Vitamins discovered by Dr. Funk. 
[01:15:00]  Polio vaccine.  We already went through that.  Polio pill.  Dr. something.  I can't read my writing.  The Schick test for diphtheria.  We came up with a chloral hydrate.  Mr. Schick.  Dr. Leif.  Yeah, these are all Jew names.  This is the worst thing I've ever seen.  Why?  Because when are you going to ever.  You can't.  How are you going to win an argument?  When are you going to walk into the bathroom?  I'll be right back.  And look right through it.  I got my.  And then come back with that name on your tongue.  I don't know. 
[01:15:30]  Joe from Jersey writes, does he have the famous Jewish sports stars book?  Oh, here we go.  What is it?  One page?  Well, yeah.  It's from a movie airplane.  Yeah.  It's a pamphlet.  Pamphlet.  I want some light reading.  Yeah.  About famous Jewish sports legends.  That's pretty much it.  I'm not famous Jewish sports owners.  Oh, well that.  Well, yeah.  We go to AJ and Syracuse.  Never again.  There you go.  AJ.  Yes.  What's up? 
[01:16:00]  I was just wondering if Vos used to play Mr. Bucket with his drug dealer.  Very good.  There's a guy that lingers longer.  And then someone wants to start a new bit.  I don't know.  We could vote on it.  Scott from Chicago.  He writes, call back Friday.  And his call back Friday thing is, if mothers rule the world, I still wouldn't drive that sociopath  sociopath to her operation.  A reference to Thanh's mother.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Let's go to Dennis in Kentucky.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey there, Dennis.  Dennis.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Poor Den.  Hey, Rich.  How you doing, man?  What's going on?  Does your index card have, you know, accomplishments from Jews killing the only living son of God?  Oh, wow.  Maybe he was a little mouthy.  Yeah, that really was wordy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we have to do this because of that.  I like turtles. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  So do I.  Cody in Indiana, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You have that card so that you can bring it up in case of an argument, right?  Yeah.  Not really.  Just have it.  You're in a non-hostile situation and you can't even read your own handwriting, stupid.  There you go.  In a hostile situation?  Well, if it was hostile, do you think if I was getting ready to fight or whatever, I'd  go, hold on.  Let me get out my card.  Yeah.  It's not going to be a hostile situation.  Yeah.  Why do you carry around that card, really?  I just had it in there for references. 
[01:17:30]  Well, why can't you just memorize that stuff if it's important to you?  Well, type it out and print it.  Or just know that Jonas Salk invented the cure for polio vaccine.  I really thought you were checking to make sure he was Jewish.  When would that be an argument?  George Washington Carver did the polio cure.  No.  It was this guy, Jonas and the Beanstalk.  Oh, God.  You know, you say how I tap my finger.  Yes.  But when you do a punchline, your eyes pop out of your head.  Like, you do the same thing. 
[01:18:00]  But yours is visual.  Mine is, you know, you can hear it.  Right.  Which on the radio is okay.  See?  Because on stage, I'm very unpleasant to look at.  But it's only leaves you.  On stage, in studio, everywhere you walk.  But when you're driving, by the way, it's got to be said, you're killed in Camden.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  It's time to give you a compliment.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, no joke.  I mean, at the ONH Empire.  No joke.  That's probably not the thing to say.  He killed.  He was, I mean, they loved you.  Yeah, it was fun.  The whole tour was fun. 
[01:18:30]  Every show.  There wasn't a show that wasn't fun.  True.  For real.  You know.  That's a shirt an Israeli should be wearing.  No.  Not an American Jew.  What, are you kidding me?  The Fist and the Star of David.  That's like Israel.  Those guys are like.  Oh, yeah.  They're tough mothers over there.  Hardcore, man.  Hardcore.  But you're just a, you're just an American Jew guy that just, I don't know.  That shirt's a little too like, hey, I'll kick your ass.  It's too tough for you.  Yeah, it's too tough.  Maybe it carries a little message, okay? 
[01:19:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  What message is that?  You know what?  Don't shoot the messenger.  Is that the thing?  How about educating the messenger?  Can we do that?  And the problem is this.  That's too, it is an Israeli.  Anthony, that's an Israeli guy's shirt.  That's a tough guy's.  Never again.  If it was an Israeli shirt, it would be an Israeli army shirt.  Because the Jewish Defense League or the Jewish Defense Organization was created in America  to stop anti-Semitism.  Maybe many of them are tough, but I'm saying you.  A shirt with a fist. 
[01:19:30]  First of all, it looks like Stern's.  Yeah, it looks like the logo for Sirius, Howard's channel.  I think this was a little earlier than Howard.  A little earlier, yeah.  Yeah, I think, you know what I mean?  You, Voss, should be wearing a shirt that says, I'd appreciate it if you refrained from  doing that.  That's a good point.  And not like a fist, but like a hand raised over the shoulder, like, eh.  Like a palm up, like, eh.  I wish the never again meant you speaking. 
[01:20:00]  Let's go to David.  He's calling from Israel.  David.  Rich, you're embarrassing all of us.  I want to run my head into a brick wall and find a terrorist to kill me.  What are you doing to us?  What do you want to say?  Israeli Mickey Mouse?  Yeah.  The Israeli ballet company.  Mickey Mouse Blum.  What did you say?  Mickey Mouse Blum.  Oh.  Put Blum on the end of Mickey Mouse.  I was just trying to make it sound Jewish. 
[01:20:30]  All right, we're going to change gears.  I'm essential to Disney.  Someone on Mickey shoveling out the walkway to Disney.  I see the women are getting ready for the Miss Pal Talk contest.  Anti-Semite that Walt was.  Good old Walt.  Good old Walt.  Walt wouldn't let you in the park with that shirt on.  He didn't like Jews?  No.  What?  No.  He was kind of a communist and didn't really like Jews. 
[01:21:00]  That's why there's no real Jewish-themed rides at Disney.  Oh.  What?  It's spinning dreidel?  It is.  You go into a bank and deposit money and come back out on a little car.  I don't know.  It's like the Epcot Media Center.  You can sit in the president's chair.  Yeah.  See what it's like to run the media.  What's the Italian ride?  You slip in.  And slip out.  It's great.  You get in the little car.  It's a little IROC.  And you go underneath a girl's armpit hair. 
[01:21:30]  And you're in the ride.  And it's a little scary.  But it's in your mom's house.  And you're not allowed to leave.  Right.  You can't leave.  And in the car, you're covered by a silk blanket.  And when you get up, there's a bloody horse head by your feet.  And you have to change your clothing.  And then you chase ethnics with baseball bats.  And then you call a Jew to defend you.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  That's the other Jew's ride at Disney.  It's a lawyer's office.  Like, you open different law books, and the theme from that country plays. 
[01:22:00]  You open up, like, the Canadian law book.  Oh, Canada.  And then you close it.  Jew's rides at Disney.  It's a big nose after all.  Our mount was cut down from 40 stories to 30.  And then there's Penny World, where you can walk through and just pick them up. 
[01:22:30]  But then there's somebody at the door when you leave that has to count them and make sure  you've given them back.  Awful walk.  People are imitating Chris Crocker on instant feedback.  Leave Rich Vance alone.  Leave him alone.  He can't help it.  He's dumb.  He's an idiot. 
[01:23:00]  It's a big nose after all.  Oh, that makes me happy.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I had a good one.  Oh, is that going to be fired?  Yeah.  Yeah, we teeter.  And this is coming in from the Lionheart.  Rich is essential to the boar effort.  The boar effort.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, that would... 
[01:23:30]  Oh, we're out of here.  You say that one.  Oh, I know.  Man.  Oh, that is very funny.  I didn't know he was anti-Semitic.  Maybe I've heard that and just didn't know it.  Yeah.  They had the whip last ride.  Anti-Semite.  The whip last ride where the lawyer waits for you to get off it.  I think you have a case ride.  No, what they call it is this.  What they do is this.  Everybody gets into a room and then an ambulance is driving away and everybody chases it with 
[01:24:00]  their arms out.  Wow.  Boy, it wasn't wordy enough.  Zippity Judah, zippity A.  What a wonderful day.  Lots of litigation going on today.  Zippity Judah, zippity A.  Mr. Bluebird's on my shoulder. 
[01:24:30]  Mr. Jewbird's on my shoulder.  It's like that.  Everything is satisfactual.  Zippity Judah, zippity A.  That's Disney.  And he likes putting African Americans in that position of like it was still the 1800s.  Oh, a little Sambo type of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That Disney was a creep.  Everybody's name was Rochester for Disney.  He was a real creep.  What a dirtbag. 
[01:25:00]  He just wanted entertainment for little white children.  When did he die?  What's that?  You couldn't get into the Mickey Mouse Club unless you were like a little Aryan white kid.  You know, I've seen it.  They slammed the door on so many kids, you know, trying to get into the Mickey Mouse.  Like if you turn on the Mickey Mouse Club and they were kids, they were all little.  Oh, yeah.  Annette Funicello kids.  All white kids.  Well, her original name, do you know she changed her original name?  It was Jewish.  Who?  Annette Funicello Berg.  Hey, what's the one?  I hate Annette Funicello.  So I'd like to take a fistful of like Jeff peanut butter and put it over her mouth until 
[01:25:30]  she just suffocates.  I don't know why I want to do that.  Doesn't she have Michael J. Fox disease there?  Oh, yeah.  She's got the, I think she's got the, I think she's got the, I just call Michael J. Fox  dizzy.  Why not update the name?  I thought she had MS, not the, the.  Oh, was it?  I don't know.  Hey, I was, MS, oh, that's right.  Yeah.  And Song of the South is still banned?  They banned that song where?  The movie.  Huh?  Oh, they banned the whole movie Song of the South?  Yeah.  Yeah, Disney won't put it out on like a DVD collection, like they bring back those movies 
[01:26:00]  and, yeah, that was kind of a woof.  Somewhere in the 80s, yeah, they banned it.  He loved the, the old dancing Negroes.  He liked that whole thing.  Do we have, can we get copies of that or?  You can't buy it anymore.  I mean, is it on like online?  Somebody has to have it.  Somebody has it.  Yeah, I'm sure you can find it somewhere.  Hey, I hate to interrupt this, but let's just get this over with.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Don't you know I'm still standing? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, it's Tom Alive Friday?  On the Opie and Anthony show.  We saw Tom for the first time down there in Camden, New Jersey, and wow.  Well, he's, uh, he gets around, which is good.  Um, he's a little pale, I would say.  A little?  And I think that has to do with his lung capacity. 
[01:27:00]  Probably not getting that oxygenated blood into his, uh, into his face.  Into all the crevices of his body.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, some of that blood just goes by still kind of bluish.  Yeah.  Uh, Tom.  Yes.  Tom is alive.  There he is.  Another week.  Wow, you're hanging in.  You're doing all right, Tom.  Yeah, yeah.  I took a couple days to recover from last Saturday, but I had a great time.  It did.  You had a good time?  Why did it take you a few days to recover? 
[01:27:30]  You know, a lot of the listeners, they drink a lot at these shows, and they need a couple days to recover.  But why did you need a couple days to recover?  Oh, a lot of activity, moving around.  A long day for me.  How did that feel?  Because you were kind of a celebrity there.  People taking pictures with you and stuff.  Yeah, it was kind of a surreal feeling.  But the people in Philadelphia are really cool, nice.  Showing the love, right?  The city of brotherly love, they call it. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, Philly's going to miss us, too, when they take us off the air.  But, uh, yeah, they do love us, and they love you there, Tom.  And, uh, I just appreciate everything, and, uh, I had a great time.  Uh, and, uh...  You know, once he's just alive, really, I'm much left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to make it short today, Tom.  Anything else?  No, I just wanted to say that.  I really appreciate it.  And, uh, thank you.  That's cool. 
[01:28:30]  What was the favorite part of your, uh, time you spent there at the Virus Tour?  Uh.  It's Tom Alive Friday.  He's in the street, I'm the feeling, he's in the street, I'm the feeling.  Don't you know I'm still standing?  Better than I've ever been.  Oh, it's Tom, Tom, I'm still alive.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  He's got a horrible lung disease. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, there you have it.  Tom is alive.  We gotta take a break.  We got Stone Cold Steve Austin in the green room.  He'll be in and on the show next.  Rich Voss, where are you gonna be?  Uh, Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey?  Yeah, this weekend, Friday, Saturday.  Very good.  Tonight and, uh, tonight and tomorrow night.  Uh, for tickets, 201-727-1090.  He's a dope on our show, but man, his stand-up is great.  He's a dope in life.  We don't want people to confuse the two issues, ever.  Voss is a funny, funny guy, man.  Thank you.  Very, very funny.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you're checking out Opie and Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  And right off the bat, I gotta say, we have to be crazy to make, uh, Stone Cold Steve Austin wait.  We're insane.  I apologize.  You came here early, but we're in the middle of something.  You're sitting around the green room.  And then you walk in.  I mean, I've seen you on TV, but who the F would ever mess with you?  It was okay.  I was, uh, I'm moving in slow motion today.  I need about another gallon of coffee and I'll be ready.  But I apologize for the wait.  I'm good.  You're all right?  I'm good. 
[01:30:00]  I thought it was Larry the Cable guy.  I love that guy.  I thought you were him.  I didn't.  Yeah, with the hat and stuff?  Do you want to get your ass handed to you?  We would love for you to just do something to him.  Oh, please.  That's Rich Voss.  The stunner.  I double dare you to throw him through that window.  I want to see the stunner.  If you don't dog dare me, maybe I will.  And it would be a challenge because it's two windows, so you're going to have to throw him really hard.  Really, really hard.  You'll definitely get him through the first window, but we want the second window to break it as well so he falls to his death. 
[01:30:30]  I thought...  We really like this guy.  That would be funny, huh?  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  We've met a lot of wrestlers in here.  You have a real...  I don't really watch wrestling, but you have a real vibe to you.  A lot of the guys come in, and you're like, oh, that's the fun guy from TV, but he has a real, like, I'm a problem vibe.  I don't feel like the normal protection you would feel because even when Liddell comes in, Chuck Liddell is a bad dude, but I feel like that protection because he's Liddell and I'm just a regular schlub.  But I feel like he could strike me. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, basically what Jimmy's trying to say, every once in a while we have a guy come in here and make...  You just make us all look ridiculous.  Like, we're helpless.  I'm starting to feel guilty.  We're helpless in your presence.  It happened with Chuck Liddell.  That's a good one.  And I'm also feeling it with you as well.  When I was watching wrestling, you were the one to watch, man.  We had a great time.  It was the best job I've ever had.  You know, lots of good memories with WWE and, you know, all the storylines with Vince and Junk and all the toys that they put in my lap to play with. 
[01:31:30]  I look forward to going to TV every Monday just to kind of...  It was a big release for me because it let me raise so much hell.  Yeah.  It was kind of like therapy.  You know, it was frustrating to me and I realized, like, the PC police got to, you know, Vince McMahon.  When you wrestled and at the end of the match, obviously you're opening up the beers and you're drinking them on TV.  Yeah.  And then something changed there where also I'm like, oh, wow, Stone Cold can't drink the beers anymore.  What's that about?  Maybe because he was throwing them out to, like, eight-year-olds out in the audience. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, well, that was hysterical.  We used to watch and go, Stone Cold's handing beer to children.  That's true.  This is fantastic.  They were bringing a cooler beer.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  And you would throw them out to the audience and these little eight-year-olds are catching them.  But then what happened?  Someone obviously sat you down in an office and said, we can't have you drinking beer on TV anymore.  No, I can't remember when that happened.  I mean, it might have been a slow spot there or I really can't remember.  But because, I mean, we kicked it right back in.  Yeah.  Because, you know, still these days when I go back to doing an appearance, I mean, we've got the beers and all the stuff. 
[01:32:30]  So, yeah.  But, you know, so much has happened.  I mean, I lost track of a lot of it.  Sometimes I'll sit there and talk to my favorite professional wrestler, his nature boy, Ric Flair.  And sometimes I'll talk to Ric.  And, you know, Ric's been around a lot longer than I have, obviously.  But he doesn't remember some of the stuff he's done.  And I guess, you know, there's so much happened.  You just, I remember a few things, but I can't remember all of it.  I try to.  Mick Foley's got an incredible memory.  That guy will remember every single thing he's ever done.  And I don't know how he does it.  And write it in books.  And he writes good books. 
[01:33:00]  He's a good friend of ours.  He comes by a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a good Long Island boy.  Me and him used to travel together back in the day.  Yeah.  He's as big a cheapskater as I am.  We're pretty tight on the money there.  Are you a real chiseler?  Yes, you've got to be.  You've got to save your money.  Back when you first start wrestling, when you're not making any money, and you kind of start griping about the money,  the old promoters would always tell you,  I ain't got a dang son.  It's not what you make, it's what you save.  It's hard to save anything if you're not making anything.  They would put you in a lot of that mentality.  And they put you in a lot of crap hotels, right? 
[01:33:30]  Well, you've got three or four guys in a car, like Sardines, and everybody's on the floors.  Seniority rules.  The senior guy gets the beds, lower guy's on a totem pole, you're on the floor.  Jeez.  Can you imagine?  And then something happens where you just get kicked up those few notches,  and you're actually one of those superstars.  And there's still those guys.  Do you look back at the guys that are kind of not at that level  and just kind of laugh and remember what it was like for that hell? 
[01:34:00]  Well, you know what?  The best thing about it is you've got to pay some dues.  Maybe sometimes guys get a break or, you know, like the system is so much different.  Back in the old days, you had to pay somebody to learn how to wrestle.  These days, you kind of go to school and they kind of pay you  because the territories have dried up and the system's different.  But a lot has changed.  But to me, part of the fun was, I mean, it's great when you're making good money  and things are good, but part of the fun to me was back in the old days.  I mean, you know, really starving and not being able to eat, you know,  maybe one, two meals a day.  But knowing that you're paying your dues, and that's the way a lot of guys came up, 
[01:34:30]  and I think that's what gives you a real appreciation for the business.  What's the wrestling groupies look like?  I mean, were they hot?  Were they like groupies?  Well, that's a hell of a question.  I mean, you know, it's just like anything.  Some are hot, some are atrocious.  There's a pretty wide skill there.  Uh-oh, that's one right there, by the way.  Yeah, that's one.  Yeah, Sam is a big wrestling fan.  You're laughing at Sam.  Yeah.  He had the WWE for his birthday gave him an actual championship belt 
[01:35:00]  that we make him wear around here.  But he took it home because he thinks we're going to, like, throw it in the garbage can or something.  It wraps around four times.  Yeah, but it's the real deal.  It goes from his chin to his crotch.  Who was, like, when you were starting out and when you were wrestling,  who was the guy that they treated, like, who was just coddled by the, like, WWE or WWE at that point?  What do you mean coddled?  Like, treated the best.  Like, which wrestler was treated the best that, like, that you were like, ugh.  I really can't remember that. 
[01:35:30]  I mean, guys, you know, it's just kind of really a pecking order, you know, who's where.  But really, they don't make a prima donna out of anybody.  You know, pretty much, you get in an airplane, it's all commercial.  You get in a rental car, you drive yourself every now and then.  You know, if you're doing an appearance, I'll drive you around.  But they really cater to nobody.  Except The Rock, right?  You know, they hire you up on the food chain.  Of course, you get treated better because you're higher up in the system.  But by no means do they sit there and kiss your ass.  It's not that kind of business.  Unless you're making money, you're on a Greyhound bus. 
[01:36:00]  That's right.  Get out of the bus.  I love Angry Vince.  Angry Vince kills me.  One of our favorites, man.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  That's it.  Boy, that whole exploding limo thing didn't work out too well.  I was.  Damn.  I was getting into that.  We were all getting into it.  We were finally, like, really into something.  That was kind of bringing us back to wrestling.  It was very funny. 
[01:36:30]  We were watching the video.  We were going over, like, these conspiracy theories.  Sam completely bought it.  He bought the whole job.  And we're sitting there going, no, look.  You can see, like, his foot and his leg.  And then, you know, disaster strikes.  Huge tragedy.  And they had to pretty much come out and go, I was lying.  But now I have a kid.  And I don't know who it is.  Who's the one?  I don't know.  What the hell is that?  Well, I'm interested to see how they're going to do the Hornswoggle thing. 
[01:37:00]  Because, I mean, everybody likes that kid.  He's a good kid.  And so I saw last episode.  And I think they can do better.  I think they can do better.  But it's good stuff.  And I like Hornswoggle.  There's always a strange twist that happens.  It's one thing you could depend on.  It's got legs if they can.  I mean, it's not something you take into the arenas to make money.  But as far as TV, if they jazz it up, they've got a chance to have some good TV again.  But I was into the whole limousine thing.  I thought they did a good job when they blew it up.  Yeah.  Pulled it off pretty good. 
[01:37:30]  That was pretty realistic.  Well, it was until we started making inquiries by calling the police department from the town.  And they're like, no, that was like the day before.  And Sam, of course, he's such a believer.  He's like, no, they're just saying that.  Sam, the leg, it's a dummy leg swinging there.  And he was all into the special investigator.  What was his name, Sam?  It was from the FIC.  The FIC.  What organization was that?  Kind of like the FBI.  But if they used the FBI, they would have been sued.  Well, they used it at first. 
[01:38:00]  And then I guess the FBI said, look, don't involve us in this.  And then it was the FIC.  The Federal Investigation Committee.  Committee.  And it was odd because the investigator kind of looked like a wrestler.  I love it.  Tight suit around him.  It was fantastic.  Come on.  Big enough suit for the guy.  Great, great gag, man.  Yeah.  Now, movies, what are you doing here?  Condemned.  Yeah, well, the Condemned day came out on DVD a couple of days ago.  And, you know, we had a lot of fun making that thing. 
[01:38:30]  You know, right now I'm just trying to find another script and start another project.  But I'm excited about the Condemned.  It's doing pretty well so far.  We've got a lot of good extra stuff in there.  You know, a lot of practical jokes and ribs that me and Vinnie Jones played on each other.  There's some of the stuff from the fight camps and learning the choreographed fighting, which was a challenge, believe it or not.  Because, you know, everybody kind of assumed that coming from the world of professional wrestling that, oh, boy, that'd be a snap for me.  But it wasn't.  It was kind of difficult because I've never choreographed a match.  You go out there and you do it.  Yeah, you just do it.  And, you know, Mick Foley would tell you the same thing. 
[01:39:00]  But we show behind-the-scenes stuff on a bunch of junk like that.  And it's a lot of extra bonus stuff.  But a good movie.  It's a good action movie.  And if that's what you like, you've got to check it out.  What's the movie about, for the people that don't know?  I thought it looked like a great movie.  I'll be honest with you.  I never saw it.  So I'm going to pick up the DVD and check it out.  That would be cool.  Well, basically, long story short, it's about 10 convicts all condemned to die in various prisons throughout the world.  They're bought out of these prison systems by wealthy TV producers, pretty much fed up with the BS and all the junk in Hollywood. 
[01:39:30]  So he buys these prisoners out of these systems, places them on a desert island, a deserted island, and makes them fight for survival with freedom going to the sole survivor.  That sounds like a great real show.  Well, that's a show they really want to make, but we just can't make it yet.  Down the road.  He broadcasts this over the internet, so basically for $49.99, you can log on at home and watch these people kill each other.  So it kind of ties in with all the rally stuff that's going on right now.  Were you the producer in the movie? 
[01:40:00]  No, no, no.  I was just one of the guys in prison.  Convict.  The producer.  Why would you ask that there, boss?  I look like a producer, right?  He's going to produce pain on your head in a minute.  I like him produce empty space where your teeth work.  That's going to make me very happy.  I might take you up on launching that guy through those two plague mats.  Yeah, I bet you could toss him right through all of them.  Boss, do you have a question for Stone Cold Steve Austin?  Yeah, kind of, I do, because growing up watching wrestling, you know, I mean, Haystack Calhoun and Gorilla Monster, they would have been everybody. 
[01:40:30]  Oh my God, how old are you?  How old?  Who?  What wrestler?  Haystack Calhoun and Gorilla Monster.  Did you adjust the aerial on the old black and white Filco television?  Everybody, when those two wrestled, because they were just big men, were so into those two, they dominated everything back then.  And where did it go?  When did it change, do you think, from just big, big to, like, glamour and stuff?  You know what I mean? 
[01:41:00]  Oh my God.  Okay.  That could be the single dumbest question I've ever heard in my life.  And here's how you knew it was going to be stupid.  Too much set up with fact.  When I was a boy, no one cared.  They're just as big, but now they're in shape.  Haystack Calhoun.  Bring something.  But Haystack was glamorous.  What are you saying?  Yeah, see?  Nothing. 
[01:41:30]  Did you grow up here in New York?  In Jersey.  Okay, Jersey.  See, I got a whole different brand of wrestling growing up in, you know, 100 miles south of Houston in a small town.  You know, I grew up on a whole different promotion, and I didn't get a chance to see.  I remember Gorilla Monsoon, of course, because he was still in the company, WWE, when I got here.  But I didn't get a whole lot of that brand of wrestling.  And I actually, WWF back in the day was one of the last federations I got just because of the way TV used to run back then.  But I wouldn't say it ever switched to glamour. 
[01:42:00]  I just think everything's changed.  If you look at old football, from what it is back in the old days to what it is now, I just think the times change and the product changes.  It just looks a little bit slicker.  It's still the same business.  It's like golf clubs.  They don't want, you know what I mean?  Yeah, just like golf clubs.  E-Rock, you got a question for Stone Cold?  Speaking of golf clubs.  E-Rock's a big wrestling fan.  You can't keep your head in with one.  E-Rock is a big fan.  E-Rock was very excited when he found out that you were coming in here today.  What's your question for him?  Is the match going to happen with you and Hulk Hogan?  I highly doubt it. 
[01:42:30]  I highly doubt it.  And, you know, they've tried to get that match to happen for a few years now.  And I'm just not really interested.  You don't want to do any more wrestling?  You know, you never say never in this business.  But I think, you know, pretty well.  I've been out of the ring for a couple of years.  I've got a lot of good memories.  And, you know, once you get out of the ring, for the time that I've been in, if you wanted to go back and just have one match,  I mean, the time that it would take you to get ready for that match,  I mean, you're looking at several, several months to get in the right kind of shape.  You know, get timing back and start taking bumps in the ring and all that junk. 
[01:43:00]  So it would be really a long process.  When you say one match, it's not just going to happen.  And pretty well, you know, I've been there and I did it at the highest level possible and had a good time doing it.  Really focusing, you know, more on the movies and stuff like that.  So I still have a long-term contract with WWE.  I'll always be a part of that company.  And I show up and I do things, you know, when it's good for them and it's good for me and it works out.  But that's pretty much the extent of it.  I think I got the translation.  Basically, he's saying the movie business treats him better.  I wouldn't say that.  The hotels are better. 
[01:43:30]  You don't have to share a room with guys on the floor.  I'll tell you what.  You know, I've been treated pretty good with WWE.  I can't complain about that.  Now, you're still obviously in great shape.  Has your workout changed from the time you were wrestling to doing movies?  I assume that you're keeping in shape for movies because you don't want to play a little skinny guy.  Well, I'm not going to have that problem of being skinny.  I could drive by a cheeseburger on a billboard and gain weight just by looking at it.  It's kind of ridiculous.  But on the road, because you're on the go so much, it's kind of easier. 
[01:44:00]  And in the ring, it's easier to stay trim.  So if anything, I'm just training a little bit lighter, you know, easier on the joints.  I'm doing more cardio.  But, you know, when you're not on the road, not burning all those calories, it's hard to stay trim.  Yeah.  At least for me.  I do a lot of cardio, too.  It's funny.  Look at him.  Not that men like Steve and I are similar, but I was kind of happy that we had the same sneakers.  For some reason, that made me pleased that we bought Nike Shocks, correct?  Correct.  Now, see, there was something similar.  And I bet you he swim walks just like you do. 
[01:44:30]  No, but I felt that bond when I walked in the room.  Yeah.  Jimmy wants Shocks.  Well, I know.  I'm like, we're both kind of athletic.  There's how they look, though, on a real man.  Yeah.  And then here's how they look on you.  Jimmy, why don't you show a real man how you exercise?  He's a real man.  Well, you got the same sneakers.  You might need a new cardio exercise.  No, you swim walk.  He swim walks.  What's that?  Well, yeah, why don't you show him, Jimmy?  Why don't you just show Stone Cold how you swim walk, Jim?  It's like when you're swimming.  No, you got to stand up and do it.  No, no, you really got to do it for him. 
[01:45:00]  And then maybe he can assess how good of a workout it is.  Because you guys are bonding.  I mean, you know, maybe you'll turn him on to something new.  Can I launch him through the plate glass window, Jim?  What kind of workout is that?  You think that's going to build muscles?  I know.  You're not going to build a whole lot of muscle.  Do you do that?  I can safely say that. 
[01:45:30]  Last I checked, I wasn't an expert.  But that just doesn't even look like it's going to do anything.  Do guys ever, because Tyson, I think, had this.  Do guys ever try you?  Because they know you're going to kick their ass, but they just want to say that they tried you?  No, no one's ever really bothered me.  You know, if I'm hanging out drinking a beer somewhere or having a few cocktails, you know,  every now and then you get someone that wants to do the old arm wrestling match.  Really?  I'm not into the arm wrestling.  And I think as far as someone trying you, I pretty much, I don't know what the deal is.  I think it's some kind of aura or whatever you give off. 
[01:46:00]  If I'm somewhere, I'm just trying to hang out and have a good time.  And I've been really, really lucky.  Some guys get bothered all the time for me.  I'll probably get my ass whooped tonight now.  I mean, even knowing that you'd kill them, they'd look at it like, well, he's rich.  So the worst happens is I get my ass kicked and then I get a lot.  It's like it's a no-win situation for a guy like that.  Look, they start the fight.  You can't sue him.  What are you talking about?  We have to take his advice.  Yeah, well, we do.  He is wearing the JDL Never Again Star of David shirt. 
[01:46:30]  So any legal advice that comes out of his mouth, you got to adhere to that.  Yeah, I forgot we got the bar fighting champion in the studio today.  I used to get in a lot of bar fights back in the day when I used to hang at the bar.  Back when I was in karate.  Guys would scream, get your hand off my lap.  Why don't you share the drug dealing story with a real man?  Let's talk about...  It's all about sharing stories with a real man today.  He's lost the recovering drug addict.  21 years.  21 years.  Let's sit down.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  But say maybe you're doing coke or crack. 
[01:47:00]  Say you are.  Okay.  Okay.  You're addicted and it's, you know, but back in the day, 21 years ago, and say your dealer,  right, might be gay.  Say he might be gay.  Right.  All right.  So wouldn't you, as a crack addict, wear shorter shorts, maybe, with certain things exposed  just to get a better deal, maybe?  You know, just flaunt what you have, if you have it?  I'm following you. 
[01:47:30]  I'm disturbed, but I'm following you.  Okay.  Say you're on an island with nine other prisoners.  Yeah, we know what Voss would be.  Exactly.  The prize.  He'd have his face in the sand like an ostrich.  He's lined up behind him.  And as far as we know, he's not gay, but back in the day, he would get really mad when  the drug dealer would pick someone else to spend extra time with upstairs.  Wait, when did that one come?  It's in the story. 
[01:48:00]  It's in the story.  You were a little jealous that you weren't picked for the special time upstairs.  Kevin got a lot of play time.  Kevin did.  Kevin.  But yeah, he's a good-looking guy.  He always was.  Voss is jealous of his other crackhead friend because the dealer liked him better.  He dressed sexy better.  That's who we deal with on this show.  That's like one of our guests.  So did y'all fight about this?  Wait, guests are regular.  Well, no, no.  When you were wearing your high heels, did you guys fight?  I just knew to dress better next time. 
[01:48:30]  That's all.  You know, maybe better cologne or perfume.  Embarrassing.  Wait, it's 21 years ago.  Ah, right.  Enough time goes by.  It's fun.  He walked in with Oscar De La Hoya's outfit.  You seen those pictures, Stone Cold?  What is it?  The Oscar De La Hoya pictures?  No.  Yeah, this is controversy.  He says they're fake.  But we're hearing things.  He's wearing fishnets.  That's Oscar.  And women's panties and a wig. 
[01:49:00]  There he is, right there.  Get the bathtub shot.  Yeah, get the bath, where the bat wing is hanging out.  There's the...  Now...  So Stone Cold...  Yeah, well, thanks for the zoom up there, Eroch.  He's saying they're fake, but...  The website is saying, no way, man.  And they're standing behind it.  That they think they're real.  And there's pictures of the girl with him.  She's a stripper in New York or wherever.  And there's pictures of her.  There she is.  She is fantastic.  She's hot.  Look how hot she is.  Like you, Voss, would put on fishnets for her. 
[01:49:30]  I would, too.  That's an odd thing, isn't it?  Stone Cold.  Jimmy said he would probably wear something similar to what Oscar is because the girl's  so hot.  Here's the thing with a guy like that.  It's kind of like cops and judges.  I mean, I don't know what you're like like that, but a lot of guys who are very...  Oscar's an alpha male.  He knocks people out.  And he's good looking, so he can probably bang any chick he wants to.  So it's boring.  So what do you do to get you high sexually?  You've got to go the opposite way.  And for him, I don't think he's gay.  That's one way to look at it. 
[01:50:00]  Again, images that are highly disturbing to me.  Yeah.  It's a good thing he's a world-class fighter.  Yeah.  Yeah, at that point, once those pictures get out.  I love that one there with the gloves and the trucks.  Well, the gloves look good.  We were saying he should hit the ring like that.  The gloves on high heels.  Nice.  That would really distract the opponent.  He must hate that one, though, because it's like, why do I have to wear the gloves?  I bet you the one Oscar likes is where he's wearing a little smart fedora and the wig  because he feels kind of pretty but sassy like an East Village hipster.  What a idiot.  Can y'all make me some copies of those so I can take those with me? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, you take.  I got some damn time in a little bit, you know.  All right.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  The Condemned is up.  It's out on DVD now?  Yep.  And you're doing an appearance.  That's why you're here.  We haven't even talked about your signing.  Let's talk about that for a second.  FYE, and let me just give the address.  It is tonight, correct?  Yep.  OPA from 6 to 8 p.m., and it's on 1290 6th Avenue, which is the corner of 51st and 6th  Avenue, and it's at FYE's tonight from 6 to 8 p.m. 
[01:51:00]  That is correct.  Well, we've done gigs there.  That's a nice place.  Yeah.  It's a great location, too, man.  You're directly at Midtown.  So you'll be signing copies of The Condemned?  That is correct.  All right.  And wrestling stuff?  Because, you know, the wrestling fans, they all do their stuff.  Oh, man, there's going to be a lot out there.  And, you know, when people come through with those belts, I'll always, you know, sign  those.  But basically, we're doing DVDs.  But, I mean, you know, if somebody comes out, we're going to sign what they got.  You probably got to buy a DVD there first, though.  I mean, if you bring one or two extra things, but don't be abusive.  People show up with, you know, five years worth of paraphernalia.  Could you, you know, just sign it, and then it shows up on eBay the next day? 
[01:51:30]  Usually, we've got someone there running the line, and they'll, you know, try to keep  it down to, you know, one item per person.  But, you know, there's some kid, and he's got a belt.  You know, we've got to take care of people.  Yeah.  And then again, by the same token, you want to sit there and spend five minutes with a  cat when you've got, you know, a line of thousands of people on.  Yeah, make a line.  You hate when they try to tell you what wrestling has meant to them.  Like, not that you hate the fans, but when they try to get into it a little too much,  you're like, look, there's a lot of people.  Can you show me?  Shut up and tell me.  Only from the part, like you're saying, there's a lot of people.  Because if you had time, I'd love to sit there and listen to all that stuff. 
[01:52:00]  Because, man, there's nobody that's more hands-on than WWE or myself when it comes  time to fans.  Because, you know, you see so many people, they get a little bit of a break or whatever,  they turn into a prick.  You can't do that.  You've got to take care of the people that take care of you.  Absolutely.  Well, that's why we all smile and everything.  When we do, like after one of our shows, the comedy shows, we do signings, and they  last a while.  And you need an idiot that controls the crowd.  You've got to sit there and smile because you don't want people to think you're the ass.  You need somebody to go, all right, idiots, move along. 
[01:52:30]  One autograph, shut up, he doesn't want to hear it.  And then everybody moves along and you go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're hitting it right on the head there.  Can you help us out tonight?  Oh, yeah.  Kenny?  Oh, the idiot's here, I'm sorry.  That's our security guy.  Kenny, give us one of the lines you use.  This is actually the guy that does it for us.  No one cares.  Tell your story, walk in.  That's a good one.  Move along.  And it's our job to be like, Kenny, come on. 
[01:53:00]  Kenny, stop.  No, no.  You know, I'd really like to hear the rest of that story, but Kenny's being an idiot.  Kenny's hushing along.  I'd love to hear.  So you need to fall back.  And our acting is awful.  No, Kenny, no.  Kenny.  Let him throw.  Mr. Fabasham, I'd love to do your autograph.  But we're saying Kenny, like, as we're already on to the next person, like, Kenny, that's  just a plea.  I'd like to sign these other seven pitches for you, but Kenny won't let me.  Yeah, right.  Seven.  Yeah, exactly.  Speaking of wrestling fans, you've had to hear the clip, the Dave Willis clip. 
[01:53:30]  No.  The crying wrestling fan.  It's one of our favorite things to play on the show.  This guy's great.  It makes us laugh every time.  What is it?  I guess some wrestlers came to, like, a high school gym, and he got caught up in the  moment, and this is what happened.  It's quick.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I mean, thank you.  Make it easy, man.  Thank y'all guys.  You're awesome. 
[01:54:00]  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  You never saw this guy right here?  That guy's fantastic.  That was real?  Yeah.  It's still real to me, damn it.  He even sells still real to me, damn it, t-shirts now.  He's got his own website.  Who doesn't?  He's got a big future ahead of him.  Oh, he certainly does.  I don't know what and what, but he's got a big future ahead of him.  I hope Stone Cold throws him through a window.  We do have to take a break. 
[01:54:30]  Sam, a question before one of your heroes leaves?  No.  He's trying to be cool.  Sam, come on.  He's trying to be cool.  Don't be cool.  Go ahead, Sam.  Do you think there's anybody in the company now that has what it takes to be a main event  superstar of the caliber that you were in your prime?  Oh, nice.  A kiss-ass.  Good question.  That's a good question.  I say the closest thing to it is John Cena.  I mean, when I hit it hard and I hit it hot, and I don't brag about myself, but I mean,  I had a hell of a run.  One of the best ever.  But I think John Cena is about as high as he gets right now.  And I see, I think he's going to continue to grow and get even bigger and better. 
[01:55:00]  He's got a tremendous youth following.  I think the youth movement right now in the WWE is tremendous.  So they're just growing a whole new audience.  I would say John Cena is head and shoulders above the rest.  John Cena.  I have a question.  Oh, no.  After you're done signing, if you're in Hasbro Heights area, I'm performing at Bananas.  I'd love for you to come.  I get you guys in front.  Shameless.  Well, I want him to come to the show.  No, I want him to come to the show.  Shameless plug.  How far is that from the FYE?  It's 40, 35, 22 minutes or something. 
[01:55:30]  Listen.  Let's get Stone Cold out of here.  Jimmy, what's the plug again?  Are you signing copies of what?  The Condemned on DVD?  The Condemned is on DVD.  It's coming out.  And tonight, he will be signing copies from 6 to 8.  It's at FYE, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, the official address.  But that's 6th Avenue.  Corner of 51st and 6th.  6 to 8 p.m.  There's going to be a line.  So don't be an ass and show up at 8 o'clock.  Just get there early and you get to meet him and he will sign. 
[01:56:00]  Very cool.  It seems like a very accessible guy.  We have the same sneakers.  Well, yeah, but I commented on a fact.  I didn't try to bring him an hour from the city to whore something I was doing.  Hey, I'm performing tonight in Connecticut.  Do you want to hop on a plane and meet me south of Massachusetts?  He's signing something.  So 6 to 8, you never know if he's hanging out.  He could be staying by one of the hotels in Jersey.  Just tell me not going.  Just tell me.  Please.  I'd like to go, but God dang, Kenny came up with a hell of a reason. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  But if you could tape it.  I'm sorry, but if you could tape it on like a cassette or something and send it to me.  I have a DVD if you want.  Do we have any DVDs around here?  I'll take a DVD if you've got one.  It's on.com.  No, I want to give him.  I don't want to plug my DVD.  I have a very funny comedy.  I would give you.  There's got to be one in the studio.  I want you to hand it to him just so I can see it broken by the elevator.  Like when he's long gone.  No, no, because he likes comedy.  He said he likes it.  I heard a cable guy.  He likes comedy.  He would watch my DVD.  How old are you going to be when you walk out of this building today and you see it in the gutter?  I bet if he gets my DVD and watches it in his hotel room, he will crack up. 
[01:57:00]  Do you have one of my DVDs?  You don't have any of them here?  Why would he sell them all?  They're going like hotcakes, Rich.  Yeah.  And why would he be watching your DVD in the hotel room when he's one of the most famous wrestlers ever and he can probably.  Oh, he doesn't watch comedy?  No, he could be banging chicks in the hotel.  No, what would you do?  Would you watch you or bang chicks in the hotel?  Dude, we've given you.  We've known you for eight years.  You've given us two copies of your DVD.  I give no way.  Oh, my God.  We don't have them just laying around. 
[01:57:30]  Read your shirt.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  We've got to take a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie was making a piddle and he is now returning to his seat.  Anthony is here and I am fighting the urge to stab Eric.  Why?  What happened with Eric?  Because my camera is a 12 megapixel camera.  The picture of me in the Stone Cold came out with little ridges around us. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  But sometimes that will happen on a really high resolution picture until you blow it up.  It doesn't look right.  Right.  So I have a little teeny card read, a little teeny four gigabyte card.  Yep.  So I say that I want to, oh, four megabyte card, whatever it is.  It's a gig.  That's a lot of megabytes.  Four gigs.  So I hand it to Eric.  I want to look at it on a computer screen and I say, I want to look at this on a computer screen.  I need a card reader.  And he goes, well, there's one on my computer. 
[01:58:30]  And I'm like, are you sure this will fit?  He goes, yeah, it's universal.  So we push it in, but it's just kind of jammed in there now.  Oh, boy.  So I am telling you that that's got to come out.  Oh, boy.  It's just letting you know.  Oh, boy.  That's it.  I asked first.  I didn't just jam it in there.  Data corrupted.  I foresee a data corrupted message when you pop the card in, which means all of it is gone.  Well, that had better come out.  Why would you tell me to put that in there without checking? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  How do you just shove it in there?  The only way to know is to put it in.  How do you check?  It's universal.  But it's like.  Yeah.  But there's like when usually a universal one's got a couple of slots in it.  Oh, man.  After working on that.  I knew that this was.  Hold on.  I don't want to lose Jenny.  Jimmy hates losing his pictures.  Yeah.  Oh.  Before we get off the air, we'll get an update on that.  But Jenny's been waiting an hour.  She's not happy with us.  Jenny, what's up?  Hi.  Hi, Jenny.  Can I help you? 
[01:59:30]  Jenny, go ahead.  What's the problem, Jenny?  Hi.  I was looking at you guys on my way to work this morning.  I have to tell you, I'm really pissed off.  What happened?  Your nice little conversation there about Jews kind of made me mad.  What did we say?  A lot of stuff that sounded really anti-Semitic to me.  Not okay.  First of all, I'm a Jew.  Hold on, Rich.  How did you feel about the Walt Disney beginning to that conversation?  I think the whole conversation was totally unacceptable. 
[02:00:00]  Did you think it was unacceptable that we were sarcastically addressing Walt Disney's anti-Semitism?  I, I, if it was sarcastic, cool.  Yes, it was.  So I'm saying, do you think it's inappropriate that we were sarcastically addressing Walt Disney's anti-Semitic?  Because here's how it started, if you were paying attention instead of knee-jerk reacting.  I didn't know Walt Disney was anti-Semitic.  I had no idea.  So when they said he was, we started to make fun of that. 
[02:00:30]  And they were saying that's why there's not a lot of Jewish themes at Disney.  See, we use humor like that.  I don't care about, I don't care about Walt Disney.  Miss, we were parodying the fact that he was a racist.  So now I'm explaining what we were doing, and you're still being argumentative.  Yeah, because you let some loser on the air that, that said that Jews killed the only son of God.  That's not, that's not cool.  We're allowing you equal time.  Oh, it's a caller, yeah.  We don't know what you're going to say.  He was a caller.  Callers get, you know, it's an open forum here on our show. 
[02:01:00]  So if he wants to say something stupid, then you could come back and rebut.  Yeah.  Which you are doing now.  We are allowing you air time.  You're being heard too.  So, but don't call the radio anti-Semitic because the guy was a caller.  I'm a Jew, and I was here laughing at exactly what they were saying because they were trying to make a point.  Do you understand?  So if you don't listen to the whole thing, you're just jumping in and calling them anti-Semitic, and they're really not.  Anthony is a little, but not enough. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, just a little bit.  So what's the problem, miss?  We've explained to you what it was.  You heard something.  You thought it was something that it was not.  Now we've told you what it was.  The point is that even sarcastic anti-Semitism is still anti-Semitism, and it's still not cool.  No, miss.  And you know what?  I am Jewish.  I am really offended by what it was.  Okay, I have a question for you.  No, I love 92.3 K-Rock.  I listen to it every single day.  So stop listening to it.  No, no, no.  I have a serious question for you. 
[02:02:00]  As a Jew, as a Jew, hold on.  Have you called Columbia University and complained about their Speaker Monday?  Have you complained about that?  I don't even know about their Speaker Monday.  Of course.  Okay, well, the president of Iran is speaking at Columbia Monday.  Don't you think maybe you should focus your attention on anti-Semitism towards Columbia University for letting him speak there?  Not a comedy show?  There's a man who seriously talked about how the Holocaust didn't happen.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, it probably completely happened. 
[02:02:30]  We just explained to you what it was.  We just explained to you, and you're so bent on being self-righteously indignant that you're so—even in sarcasm, anti-Semitism, no.  Addressing somebody—Walt Disney was anti-Jewish, which I didn't know.  We made fun of that fact.  We were goofing on Disney, and the fact that that's bothering you even after the explanation is why I really don't care if I ever offend people, because it's fraudulent.  You want to be outraged, and you want to be angry.  Yeah, and even when a logical explanation is given to you, you're still just outraged. 
[02:03:00]  Don't you understand the difference between comedy and, like, anti-Semitism and hate speech?  I mean, I understand comedy, but it's things like sarcastic anti-Semitism that make people think that it's okay to continue it.  No, it's not, man.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It's just comedy.  No, it's not.  It's comedy.  It doesn't make people think anything.  It's people like the president of Iran speaking at a college and then going back to his country and giving speeches about how Israel doesn't deserve to be there and wipe him off the face of the planet. 
[02:03:30]  Well, then he's an asshole, too.  Well, too, but he's serious, and we are making sarcastic light of Walt Disney's anti-Semitism by using his amusement park and the rides in sort of a funny way.  And you don't see any difference in those two things?  It's not funny.  It is funny. 
[02:04:00]  Maybe not to you.  Anti-Semitism, any form of sarcastic or not, is not funny.  Maybe to you.  Maybe to you it's not.  It's very funny to a lot of other people.  It was funny to me.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  This Jew was laughing his ass off.  I'm telling you.  Listen to me.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  No, listen.  Shut up.  You talk too much.  Here's the thing.  All right?  What I'm saying is comedy is always going to offend somebody, whatever type of comedy.  Call Columbia.  Go there and protest.  If you want to be a proud Jew or if you want to speak out, go to Columbia University because 
[02:04:30]  this is comedy and that's real.  That's the real deal.  Do you like the Opie and Anthony show?  I used to until today.  Then you know what?  Don't listen to me anymore.  Wait.  It takes one stupid thing we do to offend you and now you don't like us anymore?  So when we goof on black people or even when I self-deprecatingly goof on Italians.  This is why I married.  I didn't marry a Jew. 
[02:05:00]  I could not put up with this.  This is anybody though.  This is anybody who is just what you are is this.  You're a self-righteous hen who wants to peck away at somebody who's just saying something  that you find a little objectionable and even after we gave you the explanation and  you know we're telling you the truth, you're just using your outrage at other things  and focusing on us.  Are you hot?  Oh, fuck you.  Ashley Curse.  She said, F you.  You know what you are? 
[02:05:30]  You're an annoying, you're an annoying, pen-pecking bitch.  Hit a pole.  Wouldn't that be a normal question?  Are you hot though?  Absolutely.  Are you hot?  F you.  You can't, you can't be nice to people.  No.  We're in the middle of a speed round.  Rich Voss, live at Bananas at Asbrook Heights, New Jersey, tonight and tomorrow.  So, tickets available by calling 201-727-1090.  All right?  God, was she frustrating.  Also, we want to thank DirecTV.  They do the football picks every week.  Yes.  Or they give us money for the football.  No.  What?  Oh, wow. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Pat from Menachie.  Now I've got to erase that from everyone's mind.  Pat, come in here for a second.  Oh, God, am I annoyed.  I know.  She annoyed me so much that I just messed up something really badly.  She ruined me.  Oh, that was really bad.  Really bad.  I'm sorry about that.  I'd like to punch her in the face.  Well, yeah.  Yes, I would like to.  Be mouthy.  Now you're going to get now after us.  Good.  Let them come after me.  She probably gets harder than I do.  Nah.  Screw now, too.  They suck.  I know.  I finally realized why Pat from Menachie, who's sitting on the couch, who's dirt poor, 
[02:06:30]  living in a trailer that's falling apart.  I need a TV delivered to my brother, Scott, and his family, his lovely family, way out  east on Long Island.  I go to Kenny.  You know what?  I think Pat could use a few bucks, Pat from Menachie, and he's got a business where he  moves stuff, right?  That's something.  He's got a van.  I deliver.  So Kenny calls up Pat and asks him how much he would charge, hear me out here, to, first 
[02:07:00]  of all, move the TV out of my apartment, which is huge.  It's this huge, older TV.  Rejection TV.  Right, right.  It's huge.  Get into his crappy van and drive it 100 miles one way, and then 100 miles back to his trailer  that's falling apart.  How much would you guess Pat quoted me to do this job for me?  100 miles there, 100 miles back.  100 miles back.  Let me think, gas.  Why 100 miles each way?  He's got to take the TV?  He's got to come home.  He's not moving in with his brother. 
[02:07:30]  No, yeah, the TV.  My brother lives about 100 miles from where we're sitting right now.  I would charge you about 350 bucks.  Yeah, easily.  Plus gas or something, right?  No, that's like total.  Total.  350 bucks.  Pat, how much did you quote me?  100 bucks.  100 bucks?  What are you, 14? 
[02:08:00]  14, yeah.  100 bucks is from baseball cards?  100 bucks.  His van.  His van is...  Never again.  That's what you said after you bought somebody lunch.  All right, now we'll give you 105, because that was semi-funny.  100?  100 dollars.  That's why your business sucks.  Your van gets like 7 miles per gallon.  You're going 100 miles each way.  What is wrong with you?  I might have calculated the...  I figured quickly in my head that he would probably lose money doing this job for me. 
[02:08:30]  Is that why you always have to pay for your hamburgers on Tuesday?  Nah, it's like 50 bucks for a tank of gas.  So 50 bucks.  So instantly, there's...  50 dollars.  Like a half is gone.  So it's 50 bucks.  You're making 50 dollars.  So then the time...  Now, how long does it take to drive...  From Manhattan all the way out east of Long Island?  Yeah.  To...  About 200 miles.  It'll be 100 miles.  It would probably take two...  Two hours.  Two to two and a half hours. 
[02:09:00]  Let's say two and a half hours.  Right.  So it's a five-hour day.  Plus loading it.  Yes!  Yeah, it's a five-hour day.  He's got to hire somebody.  You can't lift it by himself.  I'm just thinking hour-wise here.  How much do you think you're making an hour?  I didn't run the figures.  You don't run anything.  Mexicans are laughing at you.  I didn't waddle the figures.  So now I go, look.  Now I feel bad because you said I'm going to have to go with what Ann said.  Because I said, look. 
[02:09:30]  I'll give him $200 cash.  I'll give him a dinner at my brother's restaurant because Tom's listening today.  That's priceless.  He freaks out if we mention it.  Where is that restaurant anyway?  I can't say because Tom freaks out.  He's ready to turn me upside down and shake change out of my pockets.  Because I mention my brother's restaurant every once in a while.  God forbid.  Can I mention where it is?  Because I want to go and eat there.  No.  No.  Just leave it alone for now.  And dinner at my brother's restaurant.  Plus a nice tip when you drop it off to my brother.  That's nice.  He quoted me $100 for everything. 
[02:10:00]  He's a bad businessman and so are you.  I gave you shock jock grace.  It's not that.  I feel bad, believe it or not.  I mean, I'm not.  In defense to Pat, though, just to show what a nice guy he was, he originally offered to  do it for nothing.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  He would do it for free.  Yeah.  Just make sure you hide your dentures.  But Pat, I mean, come on.  We're trying to get your business going a little bit.  You need a little cash in your pocket.  Well, yeah.  You're doing me a favor.  All right. 
[02:10:30]  Really fast.  My brother made his football picks.  Yeah.  The football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  My brother's picking the Giants over the Redskins.  The Jets over the Dolphins.  Vikings over the Chiefs.  St. Louis Rams over the Buccaneers.  The Broncos over the Jaguars.  Seattle Seahawks over the Bengals.  And what's up, Cleveland?  Browns over the Oakland Raiders. 
[02:11:00]  Want to thank Dish Network for the football picks and the cash there.  Giving up every week to the winner.  All right.  Right.  Sorry we rushed that at the end, but we got really busy at the end of the show there at  Dish Network.  All right.  Pat, don't break that TV or I'll kill you.  Oh, no problem.  Oh, boy.  This is going to be a disaster.  I love it.  I hope it costs you thousands.  Can you call?  Yeah.  On the second half of the show, can you call and tell us how it's going?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll use up my minutes.  All right. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  I'll pay for the phone calls, okay?  Rich Voss, Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, tonight and tomorrow night.  Thank you, Rich.  That's right by me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll come tonight.  Really?  I'm going to let you in free since you're only making 100 bucks today.  Oh, thank you.  And we're finished.  We're Miss Pal Talk coming up.  Yeah.  That'll be on the show as we continue on XM Satellite Radio.  Have a good day.  The Opium Anthony Virus. 
[02:12:00]  Get infected.  Showtime.  He's going on and on about how he's going.  All right.  We're on the air, Otto.  It's Opium Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Otto and George in studio.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Otto's hair always makes him look surprised.  Steven Bayshore?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I comb it with a pack of firecrackers.  I'm looking right now.  Yeah.  There's one girl there. 
[02:12:30]  She's got glasses.  Seedy Dragon Lever.  What the fuck her name is, man?  She's got like a fat little pussy.  Yeah.  Miss Pal Talk.  The contest has begun.  Most of the women are taking a very conservative approach.  They just dolly themselves up.  A little makeup.  Some sexy outfits.  And they're just kind of sitting there.  And kind of the race has begun.  You know, they're all kind of jockeying for positions.  And, however, you do have the one Jimmy's talking about who's completely naked with her legs spread open and you're just getting a gas shot.  I like that.  You could smell that horrible bush in the computer.  And that's, um, that's live, huh? 
[02:13:00]  And I see one fat mess who's going to win nothing.  And what is...  Well, let me just...  You're in front of you.  Let me just say this.  There you go.  What is that thing doing in our contest?  That thing right over there.  Which one?  Yeah, there are kind of a few that are...  Not a few.  There's a thing.  That thing she is worthy of the Miss Pal Talk contest that has begun. 
[02:13:30]  This is happening right now that's live?  Yeah, yeah.  We're looking, uh...  Flight Benefits looks good, man.  God damn.  Yeah, Flight Benefits is, uh, is topless in making her bed.  I guess that's the talent portion of the, uh, the contest.  The talent portion, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm kind of, uh, trying to find...  It's hard to sift through and find the ladies and not find guys, uh, jerking off.  Mm-hmm.  Because a lot of jackers...  Wow. 
[02:14:00]  A lot of jackers are hitting the, uh, scene here.  Jody looks very cute with her hair like that.  You know, she reminds me of the girl from the, uh, from, uh, oh my God, from the ring  who was getting out of the tub with the hair on her face.  Really?  Yeah.  I like the hair.  It's really...  It's cute like that.  It hangs down long.  Looks nice.  Jody.  Jody's got great red hair.  Yeah.  Oh, is it red?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Jody looks like my older sister if she was younger.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of creepy looking at Jody because it reminded me of my older sister when she was 
[02:14:30]  younger.  I'm not slamming Jody whatsoever.  They're talking smack.  There's that thing!  Flight Benefits...  What is that thing doing in the contest?  Flight Benefits just said, Jody looks like a Muppet.  Aw.  She doesn't look like a Muppet.  Where's Flight Benefits?  Well, all right.  Oh, she's really sexy, man.  The talent pool...  Hold on!  Hold on!  She's got her shirt on.  Hold on!  Flight Benefits is topless and a little boy shorts on.  Who put Flight Benefits right next to that thing? 
[02:15:00]  What are you...  Oh, you're talking about...  No, no, no.  I don't even...  Don't...  Just keep it at the thing.  Wait, wait.  Let me see.  You're gonna wreck my bit.  Oh, I'll get that...  All right.  Hold on.  Please don't wreck my bit.  Hold on.  Is it...  Well, who...  Come on.  All right.  I'm just...  There was a doubt.  I'm just confirming because I don't know if there's something that could be worse.  Two weeks.  Do we have a...  Two weeks.  Weeks.  Do we have a...  Two weeks.  Do we have a runner-up prize for the hideous girl on Pal Talk today? 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Now the competition has really, really gone to the next level.  Deliver Us from Eva has decided to go completely topless, and she's just wearing panties at  her computer.  Hey, what's that girl's name?  A...  A...  With the something dragon lover?  Co-dragon lover.  A co-dragon lover.  Are you alive?  She's just like this sleepy apparition in the back.  She's not responding at all.  I don't think she's even paying attention to what we're saying.  She thinks her moose knuckle is good enough to win the competition.  She might be right. 
[02:16:00]  Well, who's that, the naked one?  Yeah, with the fucking...  She's just hanging in the back.  She looks like Joe Dirt.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Joe Dirt.  It looks like someone else is laying there naked, and she's just poking her head up through  the bed.  I don't even believe she's really there.  It's a carnival thing.  Yeah.  She's in...  I'm ready to give birth position.  Great.  Yeah.  I hope the camera's zoomed in, though, miss.  You have it too far away.  This one's cute right here.  That one. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that's a little Jody.  There was a girl in Camden that was so cute that came up to Lizzie.  I hope she's on here.  Yeah.  She was really pretty.  A little blonde girl.  We got $500 up for grabs.  Dave's...  Eastside Dave's wife is...  Looks like a couch.  She's not there.  She's not on camera.  That might be a strategic move.  I don't know.  Maybe she's got something planned.  Who's the bottom right-hand corner?  She can open her butt cheeks and just get by the camera real quick.  The bottom right-hand corner.  She's a movie star. 
[02:17:00]  Is that an advertisement for bar flying or something?  Shut up.  She's a movie star.  She was in Total Recall.  Really?  Yeah.  No, really?  Where's she from, China?  Two weeks.  And, yes, deliver us from Eva.  She's got her glow stick out.  That's her bit.  Don't take her bit away from her.  She's a glow stick.  I see her bit.  Wonder.  Is this a real movie star?  What?  Would you shut up?  Oh, now they're fast-talking each other.  Yeah, they're starting to talk some smack.  Slight Benefits writes, Jody is a pussy. 
[02:17:30]  What is that thing going to do?  Why are you even trying?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Get naked.  Now they're talking smack.  All right, we got a lot of things to do as the girls do there.  Miss Pal talk thing here.  What do they win, anyway?  $500.  This is a daily thing?  Nah, maybe.  Nah, we're just screwing around here with this today.  And, of course, Marissa is just sitting there being merely adorable. 
[02:18:00]  The naked one, if she doesn't win, we'll power wash her for free.  Start bouncing the fatties?  Is that the suggestion?  Why don't we do survivor rules here?  Every, like, 15 minutes, we just, you know, get rid of one.  How many girls have we got in the competition officially?  I said officially.  The one there with the dildo looks like John Valdi.  I like her.  She looks like fucking, she looks like Dr. Dirty.  Yeah.  There's 15 girls officially. 
[02:18:30]  Well, actually, we got 15 cams up right now, and 14 are officially in the contest.  Bounce elimination.  Yeah, let's play a little game.  All right.  All the women are listening right now.  We got 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15.  Who wants to guess who the thing is?  If you think you're the thing, turn off your cam. 
[02:19:00]  If you think you're the thing, turn off your cam.  Let's see what kind of confidence these ladies have.  Oh, my God.  This should have taken a half a second.  Of course it should have.  A half a second.  Casey?  All right.  No.  Stop.  Wow.  Who turned off the camera?  Girls turned off their camera.  Who turned off their camera?  They're being smarty pantses. 
[02:19:30]  You can't do that.  All right.  Turn your cameras back on.  Turn it back on.  Even you, the creature, leave yours on.  All right.  Hey, we got some techno remixes coming in.  We got two new ones today.  We got Renee with another installment of what she thinks is funny.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  We got to do something before we get The Rock on the show.  We'll let the ladies just kind of do their thing for a while.  And when something is very noticeable, we'll break in and we'll tell you what's going on. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  It's the first Miss Pal Talk contest.  Thanks to Pal Talk.  $500 up for grabs.  Love Pal Talk, but I think they were a little cheap on the prize.  Got to be honest with everybody here.  I was trying to get more money for the women.  What happened to all the cameras?  They all went out.  Did they all?  Yeah.  Something went.  What?  Mine are still on.  Freezing.  How many people?  Are there a good amount of people in the room?  Oh, they're freezing up because...  Over a thousand.  Wait.  You mean like guys want to look at naked women? 
[02:20:30]  What?  All right.  The cameras are back.  There you go.  That fucking flight benefits.  I want someone for the comedy, like for the talent competition, just to like fire a nice  log onto a cracker.  But not sideways, like standing up like a silo.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Nothing?  Not really.  We're too busy trying to figure out who's going to win this thing.  All right.  We have two techno remixes.  Why don't we get these out of the way, Ant?  Techno remixes.  And then we'll talk to The Rock.  Then we'll talk to Renee about what she thinks is funny.  It's a new bit that started yesterday. 
[02:21:00]  And then...  Keep burping here.  Oh, and then we're going to do Than, a sitcom.  We're going to check out one of the latest sitcoms this fall.  Oh, I love that when he pulls off just the hysterical things that are in sitcoms.  Right.  You want to set up the techno thing?  The other day we were goofing on one of the channels on XM.  Forgot the channel.  Yeah.  What is it called?  Just play techno music.  Yeah.  I don't know.  BPM.  BPM?  Yeah.  BPM.  BPM.  Talk to Chris Cox.  He's in my car.  He's the king of that.  Yeah.  He's the king of that channel.  And we decided to start doing our own remixes. 
[02:21:30]  And did a great one with fart sounds and ush by MasterPost.  And now the listeners are starting to send theirs in.  So far, the best one, I think, is Drew Boogie.  Yeah.  We're going to have to spend like 20 minutes on all of them one of these days.  Maybe next week.  But Rob G. came up with this one today. 
[02:22:00]  Good dance to this.  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:00]  You know what? 
[02:23:30]  The first time I heard it, I didn't like it.  The second time, it's not that bad.  It's too much like a real techno song.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But it has all the show references in there.  Rob G., thank you for sending that one in.  What, you got jackers?  Looking at the girls?  Yeah.  Well, I went to look at a camera. 
[02:24:00]  Let's see.  Because I'm trying to look for girls.  And I found a jacker.  So he's got to go.  Why?  That's what he should be doing in there.  Why?  Having fun.  Yeah, let the guys jack today.  Can you see you guys doing it?  Yeah, just let the guys jack today.  Can they show themselves doing it?  Oh, yeah.  They're on cam just jacking.  Yeah, well, you know.  Avertly faggot question.  Oh, boy.  Get one of these pal talk things.  Oh, my God.  The thing will not get the hint.  Come on.  Open the legs again. 
[02:24:30]  The one sexy one.  All right.  Well, she was sick of opening her legs, I guess.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  And then we got another one that came in, Anthony.  I think Danny is saying this is the better of the two that came in.  Another techno remix as we check out the girls from Pal Talk.  It's the Miss Pal Talk contest for $500.  But first, we got Tom from Westbury who came up with this.  Tom from where?  Westbury.  Oh.  Oh, Westbury.  Westbury.  Westbury.  Westbury.  Of course, techno remix using a lot of show references. 
[02:25:00]  You've just been pwned.  Damn.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn. 
[02:25:30]  Don't chase me, bro.  You've just been pwned.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  I am the world, I am the world, I high-high-fielded werewolf movies, oh yeah. 
[02:26:00]  I am the world, I am the world, I high-high-fielded werewolf movies, oh yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  Hey, wow, that's pretty cool. 
[02:26:30]  There you go, Tom from Westbury.  That was a pretty good job.  That's when I was getting bored with it, he came up with that Jimmy thing in the middle  there, very, very good.  We got somebody, where did it go?  Hold on a minute.  What's up, Otto?  Yeah, what's up?  Hello.  You good?  Yeah.  I can't stop looking at Otto's toes.  Really?  Because he's wearing mob, I've never seen your toes, and Otto does have good feet.  Yeah, they're not bad.  On the left big toe, there's a callus.  Yeah, it's horrible, I can't do anything with that. 
[02:27:00]  How about getting orthotics?  What do you mean?  Why are you walking, either your shoes are too tight.  Yeah.  Do you take your shoes and duct tape the toe area?  I've been, no, I've been a big walker my whole life, but that callus is brutal, right?  Yeah, it's a big callus.  Yeah.  What's a poppin' or something?  Your whole life you've been walking?  It's not a, shut up.  Shave it down or something.  Really?  Oh, fuck.  Put a hat on it.  You're creeping us all out, man.  You know, when Norton gets me, he went to the podiatrist one time, and now he's a foot  expert. 
[02:27:30]  I've been to the podiatrist many times.  Yeah.  Many times.  Why would you go to a foot doctor that many times?  What could possibly be wrong with your feet?  You haven't even heard the latest.  I had a-  Have you ever had your feet dipped into hot oil?  Hot wax.  No.  Hot wax?  Why would you possibly put your feet in hot wax?  You really think you're a big celebrity.  You're out of your mind.  I'll explain it.  Well, he kind of is a big celebrity.  I injured my feet twice.  I twisted my ankle horribly.  He had a foot thing on his foot.  Yeah.  So I had to get her orthotics made.  But she dips it in hot wax.  It's a heating treatment, because what happens is it heals you on a vascular level. 
[02:28:00]  It's good.  Heat treatment, they use it for arthritis, too.  It's a very common treatment amongst fancier people.  Oh, really?  No, it's not a-  To melt wax on your feet.  Yeah.  I did that in camp with bottles.  Yeah, except it was your mouth melting on a cock.  Hey, all right.  Enough of that for now, because we've got a big star on the phone.  But first, Jeff M. from Halifax.  Please, I missed it earlier.  Is Tom alive?  I need to know for my own sanity. 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Jeff didn't hear.  Oh.  Jeff didn't hear.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to The Rock.  Dwayne?  Hey.  How are you, sir?  There he is.  How are you doing?  Good.  How are you doing, Mr. Rock, sir?  It's Dwayne Johnson, The Rock.  What's going on, buddy?  All is great, man.  All is great.  Guys, big movie star now.  I think you're always hesitant when you call our show.  I was just listening.  I laughed my ass off. 
[02:29:00]  You were laughing, because you're like, what the hell are they doing?  And I was like, what?  Oh, XM.  Yes.  Now I get it.  Oh, yeah, because all the fucks and the shits and yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, this is like an R-rated movie.  I noticed they're billing you now.  Like I saw here in New York on the side of the, they had a poster for your movie and they  said, Dwayne The Rock Johnson.  Are you asking them to do that?  Or do they want to put your name surrounding The Rock?  No, it just, it kind of happened just naturally.  But, you know, and then the next couple of movies, I got a movie coming out called South  Fine Tales.  And I did another comedy with Steve Carell called Get Smart. 
[02:29:30]  And in both those, I'm just being billed as Dwayne Johnson, too.  Okay, I guess somebody knows by now.  It was nothing that the studio came to me and said, hey, you know, can we use your other  name?  And I was like, no, it just kind of happened naturally.  Speaking of The Rock, Vince didn't make you like stop using that?  No, no, he didn't win.  Oh, because you're still in with wrestling, I guess, right?  What's that?  Well, because you're still in good terms.  Because if you leave the WWE, like Vince takes your name away from you so you can't promote  yourself after you leave wrestling. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, typically it is like that.  But, you know, I got to say, I got a great relationship with the old man.  And we, four or five years ago, when I decided to get out of wrestling, quietly retire, he was  great about it.  And, you know, again, I think it goes back because my grandfather wrestled for his old  man and my dad wrestled for him, too.  So, you know, there was a longstanding relationship there.  So, no, he just shook my hand and said, you know, take the name, man.  It's so good.  He burned it.  Well, you also made Vince a lot of money, man.  I mean, we just had one of your enemies in here, Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, between you and him back in the day, man, you guys made Vince a lot of cash.  That was the heyday.  We made a lot of coin, man, back then.  That was the heyday for us.  Yeah.  We were working with Steve.  Steve was great because, you know, it was just my character and his was just complete opposite.  It was always made for a lot of fun, especially on TV.  Who won your match?  I don't really watch wrestling.  Who won your matches together? 
[02:31:00]  Probably he did because every time I would face him, I was a bad guy.  Right.  He was, you know, it was my job to, you know, try and like talk as much trash as I possibly could.  Oh, you'd beat him on the mic, though.  That's for sure.  No one has had the mic technique that Dwayne had.  I'm going to be on the mic.  You'd beat me in the ring.  I heard from a lot of guys that when you came, you know, into the ring and did your thing in front of the crowd,  that everyone had to watch and see what you were going to come up with.  I mean, was a lot of that stuff off the cuff?  Yeah, well, you got to, well, you get, I had bullet points going in, but, you know, every time is different. 
[02:31:30]  So when you, when you go to, you know, any city, like say if you're at the Garden in New York, you know,  that crowd is a lot different.  So you can have an idea of what you're going to say, but you just listen to the fans and they'll direct you,  I always believe, like in the audience, in the way you want to go.  Some of your speeches, you would, the wrestlers would break character because they would just start laughing in the ring.  You're like, oh my God, that one's funny, man. 
[02:32:00]  That was my goal, by the way.  I used to try and crack up all the guys, like even Steve Austin, Kane, everybody.  I didn't care.  It's important, too, especially in wrestling, you know, because everybody has a tendency just to want to be loud and big.  But I thought it was always important just to add comedy in it.  Right.  You know, it can be, it's absurd a lot of the times, you know, the things that you're trying to say and do to these guys.  So, yeah, I didn't know how you didn't laugh on some of those, like the backstage interviews are always funny 
[02:32:30]  because the guy that was holding the mic would always be laughing at whatever you're saying.  Those guys, those interviews backstage, that's when it's free reign on those guys.  That's when it can do anything.  And I would take my T-shirt, I'd put it on them.  I'd make them, like, take his hands up.  Yeah, cover your head.  You tell them to cover their heads and he'd take his shirt on and put it over his head.  It's pleasant for the fans at home, so you need to cover that up.  Yeah.  That is smart-ass.  Were a lot of the guys jealous of you? 
[02:33:00]  I don't know.  I mean...  Well, not that they showed, at least.  Yeah, because, I mean, you guys...  You know, with me, I would always tell guys, though.  I would always tell them, like, before we went out, like, this, just to give you guys an idea of what I would say,  I would always run it down for them.  And I would always rehearse in front of them, just so they could hear it.  And I would say, you know, a lot of times, you know, I'll go off on a cuff, on a cuff,  and I'll go off in a different direction.  And I always tell the guys, you know, don't worry, I'll always come back to the point I'm trying to make.  And I said, and, you guys feel free to ad-lib.  I said, if something comes across and you feel like saying it, man, say it. 
[02:33:30]  It's a live mic, and say it.  So, you know, I gave them that kind of freedom.  Most of them didn't say, like, go off the cuff or anything like that, or ad-lib.  They kind of stuck to the script.  But if you encourage that with those guys, it's always a lot easier, you know.  And then they feel more comfortable.  It was so obvious that you were going to go on to bigger and better things.  I remember, and I, this is when we would start, you know, we're watching wrestling.  And even if I didn't feel like watching wrestling that week, I would always make sure,  ah, we got to see what The Rock says this week. 
[02:34:00]  And then you would do your thing, and then I would move on to other TV or whatever.  But you had everyone paying attention.  What was your favorite catchphrase?  Favorite catchphrase was probably, it doesn't matter.  Oh, that was, yeah, that was a great one.  Because you just, you know, you could take anybody.  And, like, I would walk in, we'd walk in the buildings.  So, for example, like, I'd walk in the garden, and I would say, you know,  let's put a security guard here asking for my autograph.  And they would do that.  And then, hey, what's your name?  Oh, my name, ah, it doesn't matter what your name is.  Hey, how's the jump to acting? 
[02:34:30]  Parents coming up to me and saying, God, you know, my kid, it's funny, but my kid's telling me that.  Like, you know, hey, Daddy, how do you like that?  Well, it doesn't matter how you like it.  You know what I said?  Well, Anthony taught us all this.  Screw the kids.  Yeah, enough.  I liked Rudy Pooh candy asses.  Rudy Pooh, yeah.  What is that, by the way?  Yeah, who knows?  I don't know, but it got through. 
[02:35:00]  What, the jump to acting, like, how is it, man?  I know it's kind of like an ignorant, novice question, but it is a huge jump.  It was hard.  It was really, really hard.  And I remember, you know, probably about the first time we started talking, like, 2000, 2001,  I was trying to make that transition.  But, oddly enough, it's just funny, man.  You know, if you're successful in something in another arena and you try and make a jump,  especially into movies, people have a tendency to say, ah, he's just trying to cash in on 
[02:35:30]  his fame and he's going to make movies that are shitty.  So the transition was difficult at first.  But then you just have to realize that.  And then it was important for me not to just take action roles.  It was important to me to take other roles, like a role in Be Cool or another comedy,  just to break it up and make sure that, you know, you don't get typecast.  Yeah.  Now, this is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing. 
[02:36:00]  Jesus.  He doesn't know you.  He doesn't know you.  And Rich even knew that because he didn't even pause, hoping for that.  Oh, oh, Rich.  Hi.  I didn't know you were there.  How did you do on the show?  The first season, I came in third place.  The third season, I came in fourth out of 20.  But I carried the show the first season.  By the way, here's how you know you're a nobody is the fact that you had to say Rich Voss from  he doesn't say, hi, I'm the rock from wrestling.  I'm the right.  He just says, hi.  He's just the rock.  I never said I was a somebody.  If you get up to his level, you'll get to say, hey, I'm Rich Voss. 
[02:36:30]  That's true.  And everyone will be like, wow, Rich Voss.  You're right.  But amongst the fans of the ONA show, they know who I am.  Maybe Rock doesn't know Rich Voss.  But now he does.  Next time he talks to me, now he does.  And he's going to forget as soon as this call is over.  You know that.  A question for serious.  Like, you'll see a lot of actors that go, I don't take acting lessons.  It's natural.  There's certain actors and some do and don't.  Do you take acting lessons?  And how many times?  Yeah, do you take acting lessons? 
[02:37:00]  Acting lessons.  According to Voss.  Acting lessons.  This has been a morning of past wrestlers just laughing at you.  Yeah.  You know that, right?  That's okay.  I really enjoyed the remake of Walking Tall.  This is Otto Peterson from the Joe Franklin show in Wonderama.  Wonderama.  I thought the Walking Tall movie was great.  I wanted to hate it because I'm against remakes in general.  But it was really good.  He won me over.  It was great.  You should do more movies like that.  We're lucky.  We're really lucky with that movie. 
[02:37:30]  Because that's a tough movie to remake.  You've got to really be careful, especially, you know.  Oh, yeah.  It's one of my favorite films of the 70s.  It was great.  Just cracking heads off with a big stick.  It was great.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Jim Norton from Tough Crowd.  Do you have...  By the way, Colin Quinn said he met you and he claimed that you were a big fan of his.  You're not, are you?  Yeah, I met him, I think, at the...  At the...  At...  Conan O'Brien.  Yeah, but he kind of made it look like you really, like, looked up to him and thought 
[02:38:00]  he was terrific.  Just please admit that you were being polite to an older gentleman.  I was being very polite to a man in his 70s.  Stupid Colin tried to act like him and The Rock had a real moment.  He's like, I was like, eh, Dwayne.  Fucking Dwayne and Russell.  Yeah.  All right.  I think, I think, uh, I think Rowdy Roddy Piper made, like, the first really good movie  where it was a wrestler.  They Live.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  That was, like, a real cool movie.  That was badass.  John Carpenter directed that.  Yeah, yeah.  After that, it kind of, you know, opened the door a little, I think, because it wasn't  just, you know, okay, here's a wrestler.  He's just going to do wrestling moves the whole movie.  It was kind of cool.  I'm a big fan of Hulk Hogan's movie work myself.  All right.  I guess we can move on from...  He's made a couple.  Yeah.  He was good as Thunder Lips.  I mean, Hulk was fine.  Well, that's true.  His first role like that was in Rocky. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  That was good.  Hey, Dwayne, is there anybody like that you, any type of role that you really want to play  that they're not casting you as or that, like, you don't think you're ready for yet?  Um, no, not now, but I will say that, you know, with the action scripts, I've been passing  on a lot of action scripts, and especially, you know, with, and only because of what Matt  Damon was able to do with the Bourne series, you know, movies are just badass all the way  through.  And the material that I'm getting, if it's not that elevated, it's not that good, then 
[02:39:30]  I just don't want to do it.  So I keep passing on, but I'm sure there's other actors out there who will take them.  Oh, what a great career.  In terms of the action, like, for me, the action is going to be that, like, that good.  Would you ever want to do, like, a weird role or some kind of a soft drama?  I mean, I know that's an odd question, but a lot of times guys get sick of the same.  I know what you're saying.  No, I think it just comes down to the material.  The last drama or movie that had dramatic elements in it was Gridiron Gang for me, but  I don't have to, like, I got to tell you, I'm not one of those actors, like, I don't 
[02:40:00]  have to explore, like, my dark side and have to be, you know, like a psychopathic, you  know, on the verge of killing the whole family or, you know, like, it's just not anything  that interests me.  I got enough drama in my life anyway.  Hey, Rock, this is Opie.  I hosted XFL, the pregame show, with my pal Anthony.  Why don't we talk about the new movie, The Game Plan?  The Game Plan.  The Game Plan, big comedy, where I played pro quarterback. 
[02:40:30]  I patterned him after Joe Namath.  Guy's just ridiculously arrogant and over the top.  But at the same time, the cool thing about Joe Namath was, you know, everybody loved him,  but yet he was, you know, over the top and arrogant, but everybody loved him.  So that's hard when you try and strike that balance.  Is there a scene where you get hammered and start talking to a girl on the sidelines and  telling her you love her?  I want to kiss you.  I want to kiss you.  One of the greatest clips of Broadway Joe ever. 
[02:41:00]  Could he have picked an uglier woman on the sidelines, by the way?  What's that?  How much drink did Joe have?  I mean, he couldn't have picked an uglier woman.  I think it was just Annie Broad.  He was cute, I think.  I think Joe might have been started in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  That was really good.  Joe Namath was huge, though, man.  Just huge.  And so you patterned him after that.  And then I get a knock on the door, and it's a little eight-year-old girl who says, 
[02:41:30]  I'm your daughter and you're my daddy.  Yay.  Oh, jeez.  And then Chris Hansen walks in and arrests you.  This is Dateline NBC.  Okay, so now you've got to deal with being like this arrogant jock kind of guy,  and now the daughter walks in.  And let me guess, it ends all sweet?  Can't say that. 
[02:42:00]  I bet it ends all sweet?  And you become a good dad?  It is.  It's a happy ending.  Of course.  Imagine it goes, it ends with a car going over a cliff.  Yeah.  Just throws everyone off.  Just throws everyone off.  Or he just starts mewling heroin and, like, leaves the movie.  Like, some bizarre ending that nobody would.  Credits stop rolling.  And like, what the hell did I just say?  Yeah.  Where all the parents and their kids have to walk out of the theater awkwardly. 
[02:42:30]  The kids are crying.  You're tapping your feet in an airport bathroom.  Hey, this is Rich Voss again from Last Conversation and the First White Guy on Dead Damn.  How about this?  Oh, I do credit.  Very good.  Rich Voss from Evening at the Improv and Ed Sullivan.  Yeah.  I do a lot of punch-ups for movies.  I just worked on a movie, a certain movie.  I do punch-ups.  Rich Voss, just remember, I'm good on the set.  What's a punch-up?  When you punch up stuff on the script or on the set where you sit on the set and you'll  see some go, no, maybe you should do it this way.  What have you punched up for? 
[02:43:00]  I don't want- I punched up- I don't- because I don't- I punched up- well, I worked on the  Oscars writing, but I punched up- I worked-  Oh, my God.  I don't want to say it because-  You need people to punch up your conversations.  Yeah.  What I'm saying, Voss, V-O-S.com.  Impress The Rock.  Tell him what you've punched up.  Off the air because the studio didn't hire me, so I don't want to use it.  No one will care.  The studio didn't hire me.  Would you just sit there and someone called you?  Could you help me?  I'm stuck.  He just stood behind a fence and started yelling out suggestions until he said, shut up.  Yeah, a fence. 
[02:43:30]  Can someone quiet that ass we're trying to film here?  Hey, Dwayne, is there anybody, any particular actor that you really want to work with?  Because you're kind of in a position to pick and choose what you want to do.  Man, I think Clive Owen's great.  He's badass.  Yeah.  And I've always wanted to work with Steve Carell and finally had a chance to work with him.  And you know who's really, really funny is Alan Arkin.  Hoppy.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Alan Arkin.  Alan Arkin is hilarious.  He's hilarious.  Absolutely.  So you've done something with him or you want to?  No, he was in Get Smart with me.  Okay.  Yeah, he was great.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  So was Anne Hathaway.  Wait, there's a Get Smart coming out?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's starring Steve Carell and Dwayne's in it.  And he said Alan Arkin did it, too.  He's going to be out next summer.  Oh, Steve Carell.  All right.  Hey, I was watching TMZ and they caught you outside a hotel like saying you make porn or  something.  And there was a kid there and you had to go, oops.  Is this something you do a lot? 
[02:44:30]  It's the way it is.  Often I put my foot in my mouth.  You know, that's where you try and be funny and break the monotony of the day.  I came out, you know, and I was signing autographs out there at the Trump and then the guy was  like, hey, what are you working on next?  I was like, oh, I'm going to do a porn.  And then there's a little kid right behind me.  And he's like, can I have your autograph?  I was like, oh, hey, take a picture.  Yeah, the TMZ, they tried to make it bigger than it really was. 
[02:45:00]  It was kind of funny, actually.  I apologize.  You didn't hear me.  He's like, no.  The movie comes out next Friday, which is September the 28th.  But there's special sneak previews in theaters on this Saturday.  Do you know if they're all over or is it just in select locations?  No, they're all over the place.  There's like a thousand of them all across the country.  So, yeah, you just have to check your newspaper.  All right.  So most major cities will probably have it.  Yeah.  Called The Game Plan.  The Game Plan with The Rock. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  The Game Plan, boys.  Good luck, man.  Good luck with the movie and with all the acting stuff.  It's nice to see that you're getting all this work.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  All right, boys.  Thanks for having me on.  All right, Dwayne.  Thanks, man.  The Rock Johnson, everyone.  Thanks, Rock.  There he goes.  Yeah, man, he's doing great.  He was cool.  Is Vin Diesel a black man?  Is he black?  I don't know.  I think it was.  He told me that he's black.  I saw that movie, Find Me Guilty, where it's about the mob.  Testimony.  It's like a true story.  He was great in that.  But then somebody told me he's Negro. 
[02:46:00]  I'm sorry.  I mean, it's amazing that he came off as an attorney.  Who told you that?  Governor Wallace?  What did you hear that?  Somebody told me he was a Negro.  Do you have any rage?  I think he's got his father or something.  He's got some African in him from somewhere.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  I liked Pitch Black.  You see that movie?  No.  He's in that one.  That was like his first movie.  Was it Van Dyke lit? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, it was very dark.  It was dark, yeah.  Who's Van Diesel?  The karate guy, right?  The karate guy.  Van D...  Oh, my God.  We don't know who Van Diesel is.  Did you just say Van Diesel?  The karate guy.  I liked the classic actor Vin Johnson.  Yeah, Vin.  He was in Private Ryan.  You got to see that movie called Find Me Guilty.  It's real good.  Sidney Lumet movie.  I don't know his movies.  I learned that about you this summer.  Yeah, he does.  On tour with you.  Hey, can we play Are You Smarter Than Rich Voss?  We really want kids to call. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, I know.  They're getting the questions together in the office.  We got to play Are You Smarter Than Rich Voss today.  We'll do it next time.  Not today, though.  We got to build it.  Why?  You got to study up?  I think Rock and I bonded.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Hey, the Miss Pal Talk contest is going on as all the cams go away.  What happened there?  We're just...  What are you doing, you fruit?  I'm not even touching it.  Yeah, it's getting all messed up.  There's so many people in there.  The cameras are slowly disappearing, as I mentioned it.  Look at that.  They're all gone now.  Yeah.  And there they go.  What happened?  I don't know.  We got $500 up in grabs.  Someone just red-dotted, like, my... 
[02:47:30]  Someone from Pal Talk, I think, just red-dotted all the cameras.  What's that mean?  Like, made it so you can't see anything.  Why?  I don't know.  I think someone didn't get the memo.  Someone didn't get the memo?  I don't know.  And they're, like, adminning the room because there were, like, nude girls.  Yeah, the girls...  They're getting all upset.  The girls were warming up, man.  They started breaking out their toys.  That is.  As we were talking to The Rock, yeah.  Sorry.  They were trying to help out because the room was getting so flooded with jackers. 
[02:48:00]  They were trying to bounce all the guys out.  Yeah.  Wait, so they help out by turning off all the girls' cameras?  That, I don't know why.  They missed.  They took a shot and missed.  Well, all the girls' cameras are still there.  What do they do in a bank robbery with the hostages?  Just blow the whole building up?  Just leave the...  Who gives a shit?  If it's in Waco.  Yeah, just...  I haven't seen one jacker.  We can pay attention to just the ladies.  We got all the women up.  We got to judge the Miss Pal Talk contest for $500.  That's all right. 
[02:48:30]  I don't even know there's a jacker in the room who gives a shit.  I'm popping up the girls' pictures.  There you go.  If I pop up a jacker, I turn his camera off.  That's all.  All right.  Otto from Otto and George.  Where's George today?  Is he sick?  I decided not to bring him today.  Yeah.  Like, confident.  Fuck him.  I was so confident.  Fuck him.  That means...  I said Otto brought a hornet's nest on the side of his foot.  Shut up.  A hornet's nest.  I have flaws.  That means your...  That means your therapy's going well. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  This is the first time you've appeared without George.  You go solo.  Yeah, I mean, usually I just sit here holding him like a fucking operation.  Yeah, for no reason whatsoever.  It's weird.  It's like I took a new headshot recently, and I really just creeped out that I do that for  a living, you know, just holding the doll.  And I don't know, it just seemed more natural when I was a kid to have my picture taken with  a dummy.  But now I go, look at me.  I'm just weird.  I'm a grown man.  I'm just holding this fucking dummy.  You're finally to the point where you realize it's a bit creepy.  It's disturbingly weird.  It's still a good living, but now you're starting to realize it's a bit creepy. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know.  I mean...  I tell the Otto...  I could be a stand-up, but there's enough fucking stand-up comedians.  At least I have something different, you know?  Yeah.  You do what you do, man.  It's respected.  Dude, you killed.  You killed this summer.  Oh my God, yeah.  Tell me how I killed this summer.  You really did, Otto.  You killed.  Thank you.  You got laughs so big, I didn't see how they could be bigger.  Really?  Thank you.  Otto's, by the way, Otto's plugging a gig with one of my friends, Bob Levy.  That's going to be amazing tomorrow.  The shittiest hair in show business is Bob fucking Levy. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, I know.  How about...  Where are you guys going to be?  At the...  The House of Blues.  It's in Atlantic City.  It's September 22nd.  What night is that, sweetie?  Is that tomorrow?  That's tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  10 o'clock, yeah.  House of Blues on AC.  You can go to Ticketmaster, or you can call 609-236-2583.  I really hope a lot of Opie and Anthony fans come to see this show,  because it's going to be strong.  Otto is fucking...  It's brutal, and it's like machine gun speed live.  He's just really one of the greats. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  And everybody knows that who has a traveling virus.  And Bob Levy is also a fucking...  Just a filth bag.  Yeah.  A filth bag.  I saw him once at a roast.  Was it your roast?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was hilarious.  That was the only time I saw him.  I never saw him stand up.  Bob, yeah.  Who could be the worst alcoholic in the show.  He goes to the show three hours before so he can drink.  Yeah, he's the worst.  He goes like three hours before.  Yeah.  He's out of his mind.  You know, he closes his act by eating blue cheese out of a girl from the audience's anus.  That's bullshit. 
[02:51:00]  I started that.  You did?  No.  It's a guy's ass.  Here's the question, because I've heard that over the years.  Yeah.  He gets a girl every time?  Yeah.  Every time.  Well, he started off with whipcrowns.  Or is there like ringers in the audience that he has to pay?  No, no, no.  That's a good question.  Why would a girl want to humiliate herself like that?  I would understand here and there you're going to find one, but every gig he knows he's  going to close with this and it's going to work every time?  Yeah.  What's his plan B if he doesn't get a volunteer?  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Probably Thousand Islands or Caesar.  Well, yeah.  Wishbone is sponsoring my tour.  We did the-  That ass-flavored dress. 
[02:51:30]  Truthfully.  We did the Kid Chris Christmas last year, so Levy went up and ate blue cheese out of some broad's  butt or whatever.  Yeah.  And you know the drunken animals in the audience, and then Colin has to follow him.  I know.  I got to follow him tomorrow.  Follow him with a fucking garbage truck.  But you could follow anybody.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You're strong enough.  Thank you.  You could follow anybody.  Barry from Pittsburgh suggests that if you need a puppet, Otto, that you could use Rich  Voss today.  He's more than willing to help you out. 
[02:52:00]  Dummy, yeah.  Remember when we came to your house late at night, me and Bastille and you, and we were smoking  crack and he was shooting heroin?  That was in Brighton Beach.  Yeah.  I finally tried to get you guys to eat a hot dog.  No, you didn't have a hot dog.  You just had beans.  No, I had a fucking-  You had a hot dog too?  Yeah, I had Hebrew National Hot Dogs.  We're so fucked up.  Because of the JDL shirt.  I'm all cracked out.  Frankie's on heroin.  I don't know what Otto's on.  And now we're starting to nod and out of nowhere, Otto just pops up and goes, fuck Gary.  Fuck this.  Remember you were like fucking the- 
[02:52:30]  Fuck, fuck Messina.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to-  Right?  Just the people that wouldn't hire us.  Yeah.  It's just like every 20 minutes, she would go, go fuck themselves, right?  Yeah.  I'm talking to the coast.  I was, I'm on the coast.  The east coast.  And we're just out of our mind.  You had to be there.  It was a drug store.  Oh, boy.  What?  How do you ruin-  When I heard you had to be there.  How do you ruin-  He called a rock back to tell him that one.  You ruined this fucking comedian drug story.  How did you do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, when you hear you had to be there.  Yeah.  And I knew he was losing confidence in it. 
[02:53:00]  And then he's like, fuck.  Yeah.  Nothing from anyone.  Yeah.  So then we're still-  So the drug dealers used to hit you in the head with the rocks that you bought?  Nothing.  No.  I'm not helping anybody after the week.  I've been bombing.  Yeah.  He said, I'm fucking swung and missed.  I have a back fucking pull.  Hey, we got an update from Club Soda Kenny.  Remember Pat from Minaki doing me a favor today?  Yes.  Getting a really big TV out to my brother.  He's driving 100 miles each way.  And he said he would do it for $100, which is just completely ridiculous. 
[02:53:30]  Since his van is a piece of shit.  He has no money.  His trailer's falling apart.  And I think his van gets about seven miles per gallon.  Well, we got an update from Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny!  Hey, what do I always give you guys?  Radio Gold?  Bad news in between.  Bad news, Grace.  What happened?  Yeah, bad news.  It doesn't fit in the van.  Oh.  What, Pat?  So the options are I could rent a U-Haul for the day or we can lay it down on its face, 
[02:54:00]  which I don't think is a good idea.  No, no, no.  Why not?  He has one of those moving blankets.  Yeah, but he's only got one.  If he had more than one, I would be comfortable with more padding, but he's only got one.  No way.  Why can't he lay it on its back?  If you need padding, Norton will come and lay under it.  Dude, it's bad to lay those TVs down.  Yeah.  Is it a flat screen?  No, it's like...  It's, uh... 
[02:54:30]  I think there's stuff in them you should not...  Is it one of those big...  Is it your old TV?  Yeah, it's like...  Oh, okay.  It's really large, but it's like...  It's a projection.  It's like a 12...  It's rear projection.  It's like 12 to 18 inches deep.  Oh, the one you had in your apartment?  Yeah.  Yeah, rear projection.  40 inch.  No, it's way more than that.  It's not going to lay it down at all, I don't think.  No, those things are supposed to stay upright.  You've got to realign the mirrors and everything.  It's a big pain in the ass.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah, I'll lay it down, bro.  Well, what are we going to do?  Get a U-Haul.  I can go rent the U-Haul, or the maintenance men in your building will be very happy to get this. 
[02:55:00]  I'll carry it on my back.  Put it on the roof of the truck.  Put some pads down and tie it down on the roof.  I think you lay that stupid thing down and get it out there, and then let my brother figure it out.  You think?  Get a U-Haul.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, because I could go see if a U-Haul is available.  I could get one for today for about $60, $80.  If not, we could try. 
[02:55:30]  Who cares?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, then.  Well, because I want Pat to...  Because I'm not paying him unless he does the job.  I know.  He always asks me if he has to give the money back.  Everyone's saying don't lay it down.  All right.  Then rent the U-Haul, I guess.  All right.  All right.  I'll take care of it.  I'll give you an update when I have one.  When I have better news.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, I thought he said I have better news.  No, he said when I have better news.  Okay.  Why don't we take a break?  Ms. Powell talked.  The girls are getting crazy now. 
[02:56:00]  What does Deliver Us from Eva?  I've never seen this from her before.  Yeah.  What the...  She's rocking a...  Naked and rocking a big dildo.  She's rocking a flush rocket.  Yeah.  Got a big dildo.  Nice.  I think my whole screen is freezing.  Look at Red Run.  At this point.  I might have to reboot.  Fishy piss slit.  Damn it.  Oh, my God.  Fishy piss slit.  All right.  $500 up for grabs.  Damn it.  Who's in the lead, Ant? 
[02:56:30]  You got some...  Who do you bear is cute?  I don't know, because I'm so goddamn biased.  Who do you like?  I just...  There's only, like, two girls that really like...  Who do you like?  And it's not even based on their sex thing.  They're just very cute.  Who do you like?  I...  I know who you are.  Of course, Marissa.  Uh-huh.  You know, because she's a pal, and she's very, very cute.  And she has an ass worth killing family members for.  Yeah, exactly.  And who else? 
[02:57:00]  And Jody is very, very cute redhead.  Aw!  She's adorable.  You like redheads.  You got her smiling now there, Anthony.  I couldn't see her, because it's all frozen up on me.  Yeah, she's smiling.  And now she's...  I'm like a reset.  She's small.  She looks like she's a little, like, a small.  She's not a big girl.  She's adorable.  Saw her down there at FH Riley's.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  She looks very young.  All right, we got to take a break.  More with Otto.  Very young girl.  Just Otto, from Otto and George. 
[02:57:30]  Very nice smile.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong, though.  You babysit, you talk to him, show him how to make a boy love him.  Oh, God.  What is that?  Creep.  That's the only thing that creeps me out.  That's his creep.  That's just creepy.  You put him on your lap, and while they're napping, you just slip in the tip.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're despicable.  Hold your door, and you explore it, doll.  All right. 
[02:58:00]  That prosecutor tried to kill himself.  They should have learned that piece of shit.  He fucking went to molest a five-year-old.  He's a federal prosecutor.  Oh, yeah?  And he brought Vaseline in the door of the Explorer doll.  Oh, yeah.  And they arrested him, because it was a sting in Detroit, this scumbag.  And he's in jail, and he tried to hang himself.  Oh, wow.  They should have...  Why would you stop him from killing himself?  Save the taxpayers the expense of fucking housing that garbage.  Let him die.  Hey, wow.  Don't be so harsh.  Was he caught on TV or something?  No, he was just going to arrest him.  He was a fucking five-year-old. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, I heard that.  All right, listen.  When we get back, we're going to play...  Renee brought something she thinks is funny.  We started this yesterday.  She brought in something else that she thinks is funny.  We'll do that next.  And then we've got to get to Than's thing, the sitcom, Back to You.  Yeah.  Which did very well in the ratings.  Did it?  And Than is going to, you know, show everyone why this sitcom stinks.  We'll do it next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Andy.  That's what you're listening to.  I am Andy. 
[02:59:00]  Opie and Andy.  Tom from Colorado writes, you guys have brought Pal Talk to its fucking knees.  I can't get back on.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  The old days.  The Miss Pal Talk contest is a complete disaster for everybody.  Well, it's because it's kind of... 
[02:59:30]  We have completely destroyed...  The server.  The server right now.  We are really...  Well, we got a lot of people in here.  Yeah.  We got a little blonde at the bottom.  I'm going to try to...  We got $500 up for grabs here.  I'm going to try...  What are you trying to do there?  I'm bouncing guys now.  Now, they've gotten to the point where...  But the guys want to be in there to check out the hot girls.  Screw them, then.  Don't turn your cameras on.  You turn your camera on... 
[03:00:00]  All right.  So, if they turn their camera on, they've got to go, right?  That's it.  Yeah.  Guys, turn off your cameras and just check out the hot girls.  Hey, when are we going to have...  That's it.  Turn off your goddamn cameras, guys, or I am bouncing your asses.  That's what I've been doing the whole break.  Just bouncing guys.  How about this?  Next contest is a Pal Talk Jacker contest.  Yeah.  There you go.  That way...  Yeah.  Do that when I'm out sick, please.  The guys will have fun.  Are you guys by size?  No.  I don't know.  Just by the worst one.  Ferocity. 
[03:00:30]  Ferocity.  Just the worst jacker.  All right.  We got to give away the $500.  What's the quickest?  Can you do it under a minute?  Can you finish under a minute?  I can't get dick hard under a minute, man.  I'm a professional.  Really?  No.  No.  Do you come in under a minute?  I can't...  If I...  Well, if I build up and I work and I keep looking at pictures and stuff, it depends what the  guy looks like.  And then...  Hmm.  I get it.  That was awful.  That was a kind of good misdirection joke in like 1981. 
[03:01:00]  I'm like...  Like Wally Lieberman.  All right.  Let's get Renee in here.  Renee, one of our interns...  I don't even know how this began.  Oh, she found that awful song parody that Scott and Todd did.  Horrible.  No, she found it funny.  Yeah.  She thought it was kind of funny.  It was horrible and she found it funny.  Yeah.  So we were really confused by Renee.  So we said, Renee, why don't you bring in something that is funny?  And yesterday she brought in something that was kind of funny, right? 
[03:01:30]  Jimmy sort of liked it.  I sort of thought it was okay after I saw the video.  And really wasn't digging it at all, right?  Didn't like it.  So we asked her to bring in something else today, right, Renee?  Yes.  Did you say hi to Otto?  Hi, Otto.  She got me a water.  She was very sweet when I first got here.  She's a nice girl.  Yeah.  She's a very nice girl, yes.  So what did you bring us today?  It's...  I found the video before, but I kind of ignored it.  I wasn't sure if we were down with it.  But it's this crazy lady.  She pretty much goes nuts.  We're not sure if she's high, she's drunk. 
[03:02:00]  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Crazy lady goes nuts.  I'm not sure if it's the same one, because there's a bunch on there.  But we'll see what's going on.  It's pretty good, I think.  Well, then again.  Crazy lady claims she had nothing to eat or drink, wants to go to Las Vegas.  Everybody hates her.  Yes.  And you thought this was really funny?  I thought it was.  It's better than yesterday, I think.  Where is she from, Renee?  Like, where was she shot?  Where was she filmed?  Where was she...  She was in, like, one of those outside restaurants type thing, like, on the sidewalk, and she's  just laying there screaming. 
[03:02:30]  Okay.  All right, Otto, you can make fun of her any time you want, by the way.  Anytime.  Anytime.  Go ahead.  She's fair game.  Her?  Yeah.  No, not at all.  She's lovely, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, thanks.  Sammy, what's going on, bud?  I want to get out of here!  We're going in here!  How much did she have to drink today?  How much did she have to drink today?  I don't know.  I didn't leave the inner drink.  Sounds like Lucy.  Is she a patron here?  I want to go to the club. 
[03:03:00]  Lucy.  Yeah.  Ricky!  Nah!  Sounds like Norris apartment in the morning.  I did what?  Yeah.  Is she a patron here, or...  Is she a patron here?  That's all.  Okay.  Hey, what a gun a lot!  I can't stand my voice!  I got it.  Talk about an unhappy customer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Do you have patron here?  You're just on your meeting.  Okay.  If you want to go to Las Vegas, I can't stand my voice!  That's what I hear in my head  Every time my girlfriend opens her mouth  Say anything  If it's hello  Tell that thing to button up her shirt 
[03:04:00]  Is there more audio  This should have been three tracks  But I'm not sure  I think you got them all  Do we go to the second track?  Was that enough to pique everyone's interest?  Yeah, yeah  I want to hear more  Okay  I think she sounds pretty fucking crazy  So good?  So far so good?  Slow down  Yeah, yeah  So far so good  Okay, I'm not going to rush anything  Crazy lady  I gotta get out of here

I like her voice  It is like Lucille Ball  Alright, so it's better than yesterday, right?  Definitely better than yesterday  I'll give you that  But is it supposed to be funny?  Because no, I didn't hear laughter amongst them  No, it was more enjoyable  It's kind of funny  It's cool

Oh okay  Yeah  Yeah  The back story  So you know  Yeah absolutely  A little bit  A little bit  Well Kelsey Grammer  Was an anchor in Pittsburgh  With Patricia Heaton  Their characters of course  And then he got his big break 
[03:12:00]  And went to LA  But then  Yelled  At somebody  On the  On his big LA show  And ended up on YouTube  So he ended up  Back in Pittsburgh  Ah  So it's a news anchor?  It's a news  Two news anchors  Okay  So now he's back  In Pittsburgh  And Patricia Heaton  Still there  And that's  Pretty much  I think that's  All you need to know  And is there  Sexual tension  Between the two?
