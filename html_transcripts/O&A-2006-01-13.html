<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton – riffing on a bit where Anthony added sarcastic and racially charged commentary to old, blatantly racist cigarette commercials. This transitioned into a discussion about smoker's rights and the perceived loss of freedoms in modern America, contrasting past liberties with current regulations.  The conversation then took a sharp turn as Norton launched into a graphic and sexually explicit recounting of his experiences with high-end escorts from nyconfidential.com, specifically detailing his encounter with an escort named Natalia. He described the agency, the encounter itself (including oral sex), his anxieties, and the overall experience in explicit detail, contrasting it with his typically poor sexual performance.  This led to listener calls discussing Norton's apparent addiction to escort services, the difficulties of relationships, and the frustrations of nagging partners.  A news story about a man murdering his nagging wife was discussed, prompting more listener calls sharing their own relationship woes.  Audio outtakes from Tony Danza were played, and the segment concluded with further discussion of relationships, interspersed with a humorous aside about Bob Kelly attempting to make Norton smell his belly button, and a mention of Norton’s concerns about getting tested for AIDS.

Next, the show revisited a past argument between Opie and Anthony about cell phones before moving on to a call from "John the trucker," who claimed to have killed his first wife while on acid and served 15 years for the crime.  He detailed the circumstances, blaming his wife's nagging, and nonchalantly described the murder and subsequent arrest. He mentioned meeting his second wife in prison and stated he didn't pay child support, implying the murder was "worth it."  The hosts expressed disbelief.  The show then shifted to a scathing critique of Tom Brokaw's retirement from NBC Nightly News, filled with crude humor and impersonations of a distraught Brokaw, referencing *About Schmidt*.  A clip of Brokaw's final broadcast was played.  The segment concluded with a discussion of "Psycho Mark," a former employee who gave an interview to Fox News about the Opie and Anthony firing after the St. Patrick's Cathedral incident. The hosts played the audio, mocking Psycho Mark’s nervous demeanor and formal tone.

The show then discussed a morning show's cancellation and the hosts’ potential future employment, leading to a bit about offensive baby t-shirts, citing examples from a site called T-Shirthell.com, including extremely offensive slogans about race and abortion.  This transitioned into a discussion of Reverend Al Sharpton's impending divorce, fueled by a picture of his wife that the hosts believed depicted a man in drag.  A phone call with Reverend Al Sharpton himself ensued, featuring humorous and offensive comments about his wife.  Earl, a frequent caller, then weighed in, calling Sharpton’s wife a "dude," followed by a discussion of Earl's habit of not paying his share of the bill. Steve-O from Jackass joined the show, initially asleep nearby.  The hosts played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, commenting on its violence and racial insensitivity. Steve-O discussed his tattoos, girlfriend (Victoria's Secret model May Anderson), various dangerous stunts (including a near-death experience with lions), his time on Jackass, Chris Pontius' bachelor party, an incident involving John McEnroe, and a "butt chug." He also mentioned his arrest for international drug smuggling involving a condom filled with hashish.


The final segment focused on further discussion of Steve-O's experiences, including his arrests in Sweden (marijuana smuggling) and Louisiana (stapling his scrotum to his thigh). He promoted his new DVD, "Steve-O: The Early Years."  A significant portion of the segment involved a profane argument between Opie and Anthony over using a sound clip of Verne Troyer from "The Surreal Life."  Steve-O also discussed various Jackass stunts, including testicle electrocution and paper cuts, and the arrest of Chris Pontius, who was found naked and passed out on a car roof.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You are listening to the worst.  Not the best.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Good morning, it's Opie and Anthony, and of course, old Jimmy Norton.  Don't forget to pick up your latest Jim Norton CD at eatabullet.com.  Hey, hey.  The name of the CD is very, very hard to remember, so Jimmy, if you will.  Trinkets I own made from gorilla hens. 
[00:00:30]  That's right.  This is one of my favorite bits since coming to XM Satellite Radio, I've got to tell you.  It's when Anthony went off on the whole cigarette ad thing.  Oh, right.  I remember that like it was yesterday.  I think Steve found some old cigarette ads, some old cigarette radio commercials, and  Ant just went off on a tangent.  You know, that's the beauty of doing the show with Anthony.  Sometimes you just don't know where he's going to go, and this is one of the standout bits  we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio.  A brilliant improv.  Ooh.  Check it out.  It's the worst. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  So, Anthony, we got the Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  Yeah.  We mentioned this earlier.  A little earlier.  The times they did a change.  They used to be able to have cigarette ads on television.  And even cartoon characters, which now you can't have a cartoon character hawking anything  now, or else they say you're exploiting the children, harming the children.  But back in the old days, cigarettes.  Who was this?  Winston, I think.  Winston.  Fred and Barney.  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back where we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred. 
[00:02:00]  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chug.  Oh, man.  The Flintstones have been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette. 
[00:02:30]  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chug.  Wilma, Wilma, I've got to get to the rock barry.  They took my throat out.  I got throat cancer from Winston cigarettes.  Barney, Barney, could you pedal the car with your feet today? 
[00:03:00]  I'm weak from the chemo.  Ah!  That cartoon's hawking butts.  They show Betty in one episode having to fill one side of the bra with tissue.  She smoked for a long time.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  Why, Betty?  Why, Betty?  Oh, we're going into silly zone again.  All right.  Well, there you go.  The Flintstones talking about cigarettes, that's a little strange.  The voices were a little off, though, right? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, it almost sounded like fake Fred.  Hey, Barney.  Yeah, it sounded like Jackie Gleason.  Yeah.  Well, that cartoon was based on the Honeymoon.  Based on the Honeymoon.  Stolen from.  I hated the Flintstones.  Did you?  I loved it growing up.  The Jetsons, too.  Hated it.  I hated the Jetsons.  Loved the Flintstones, though.  God.  I like Bugs Bunny because there was a viciousness to it.  Bugs was great.  Probably the best cartoons ever made were the old Warner Brothers cartoons.  But now they cut out all the violence when you see Bugs Bunny now. 
[00:04:00]  All those cartoons were all about the violence.  It's all about smashing people on the heads with frying pans and shooting them in the face  with shotguns.  And then they cut it to pieces now.  I'm the Easter Bunny.  Hooray.  Smashing his face on the ground.  Oh.  I loved it.  I loved those cartoons.  Growing up, watched them all the time.  I can't believe you didn't like the whole nastiness.  Never liked them.  The what?  Bugs was just a nasty thing.  I liked Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you did?  No, I loved them.  I thought you said you didn't like Bugs Bunny. 
[00:04:30]  No, I hate the Flintstones.  I liked Bugs Bunny.  I'm so confused.  No, no.  Bugs Bunny was great, man.  That's the best cartoon.  It is.  Uh-oh.  F-ing idiots.  Peter from Whackbag.com.  What cigarette did Opie smoke?  Chesterfields?  No, he kicked that habit.  Right in the liver.  A lot of rumors flying around.  Yeah.  As far as this show goes.  I don't know why.  What are you giving me, Eric?  People love Lost in Space.  Oh, okay. 
[00:05:00]  I see.  All right.  Thank you.  What did you give Opie?  Just cartoon theme songs.  Oh, what is it?  What are you drinking, Ben?  A little water?  Can we get more coffee?  I'm fading.  Go on.  Opie wants coffee.  Let's go.  Coffee.  All right.  Well, we have the Winston commercials, too.  You want to try a couple of these?  Yeah.  Let's hear some of these older day commercials.  Oh, no.  This is for Newport.  Newport.  Yo, B.  I loves the Newport. 
[00:05:30]  Hey!  Groovy.  Just give me a coffee.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  I decorate.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  This is just conjure up images of walking into the Copa.  Tastes better, too.  Smoking cigarettes and drinking.  Yeah.  Any other Memphis cigarette. 
[00:06:00]  Walking through the back of the Copa.  Walking through the back.  I think that's about it.  Up front.  I think that's about it.  It's just a jingle.  That one's boring.  That music's great, ain't it?  And then this one's for Lucky Strike, Old Cigarette Ads.  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  What? 
[00:06:30]  L-S-M-F-T.  L-S-M-F-T.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes.  So round.  So firm.  So fully packed.  Yes. 
[00:07:00]  So free and easy on the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike.  And remember, collards, use your own water fountain.  Don't these just all sound?  Yes, Lucky Strike.  Smoke them without Negroes around.  After you've run the fire hose on black people, enjoy the draw of a nice Lucky Strike. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, Lucky Cigarette.  Yes, Lucky Cigarettes.  To be enjoyed without the pain and agony of having black people around.  You could walk into a diner that doesn't serve Negroes and light up a Lucky Strike.  So after you go home and beat your wife, draw on a nice Lucky Strike.  You'll be lucky there are no Negroes in your neighborhood. 
[00:08:00]  Because you're white and live in America.  And you're free not to live near black people.  And smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Ah, the good old days.  That's wonderful.  What do you call a black guy that's smoking a cigarette?  Um.  Um.  See, you laughed.  I wanted to tell you the answer there.  What was the answer?  I'm not saying that.  You're wrecking the timing of the bit. 
[00:08:30]  You call him nicotine.  Nicotine.  What?  That's what's in a cigarette.  Nicotine.  Oh, nicotine.  That's what I said.  Nicotine.  Okay.  Enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  And enjoy your whiteness.  And the whiteness of your neighborhood.  Your family.  Your workplace.  The water fountain.  The buses.  Every place in America.  Lucky Strike.  The official cigarette of the Send Them Back to Africa campaign. 
[00:09:00]  Feel that draw.  The pleasure of smoking.  And living in a white country.  After you sick the German shepherds on some Negroes.  Enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  They're wonderful.  Like white people.  They just all sound like that. 
[00:09:30]  You can tell it's old.  Right.  There's something about the sound you can tell.  There's just that sound of rampant racism in it.  Let's try a cigarette spot for Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair cigarettes.  Now a cigarette that's low in tar and nicotine.  High in menthol flavor.  New Montclair.  Just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure.  How much is just enough? 
[00:10:00]  Just enough menthol to please your taste.  Montclair's new charcoal menthol filter does it.  Charcoal granules that are both activated and mentholated release just enough menthol to freshen every puff.  So every puff tastes as good as the first puff.  What's so modern about Montclair?  Modern.  The answer is in Montclair's modern menthol flavor.  Yet Montclair is surprisingly low in tar and nicotine.  But the flavor's still there when you smoke Montclair just enough in every puff. 
[00:10:30]  Makes every puff a pleasure.  Smoke Montclair.  New from the American Tobacco Company.  Mmm.  That sounds good.  More mellow.  Yeah, that's a mellow one.  Do you want another lucky strike?  We'll try one more lucky strike.  Lucky.  Places all.  All joint hands circle lift.  Now circle right and listen to me.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T. 
[00:11:00]  Elementary corners like swinging on a gate.  Right to your honey with a right to your left eight.  Grand right to your left around you go.  Lucky strike means find a back goal.  Meet your honey and give her a whirl.  All swing around with your little girls.  Smoke them, smoke them.  Then you'll see.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Promenade and don't you fall.  Promenade around the hall.  Lucky strike is first again.  First again with tobacco men.  Promenade straight down the pike. 
[00:11:30]  It's time right now for a lucky strike.  Yes, for smoking that you're bound to like.  You just can't beat a lucky strike.  Yes, sir.  They're playing that chicken picking music.  I hope whoever wrote that never smoked and still got cancer.  Swing your partner to and fro.  Look around.  No black symbol. 
[00:12:00]  Ah, yes.  Lucky strike.  The wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of lucky strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school.  No negroes here.  The only place you want charcoal is in your filter.  The charcoal filter of lucky strike.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  That's also the only place you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood.  Lucky strike. 
[00:12:30]  What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a lucky strike.  You can light it off your zippo lighter, a match, or a burning cross on a negro's lawn.  Whatever it takes, light up that lucky strike.  You know why lucky strike cigarettes are so good?  Look at them.  They're white.  That's right.  When have you ever saw a black cigarette?  Never.  Because it couldn't possibly be good. 
[00:13:00]  Lucky strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke luckies.  Because we don't like negroes.  There he is.  What a time.  What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for lucky strike.  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport.  Another Newport ad.  These were boring, though, right?  We didn't like the first one.  I don't know.  It's kind of jazzy. 
[00:13:30]  Scooby-Doo-Wawa.  Smooth and fresh is the Newport taste.  Never harsh, never rough.  The smoothest tasting menthol cigarette.  New, king size, and new deluxe 100s.  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her? 
[00:14:00]  That's the same.  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads are all, have a cool, mellow thing?  Like that was the message that was like, you hang back and have a menthol ad.  Right, right.  But the other cigarettes, lucky.  Smoking lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bitch-ditch?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language. 
[00:14:30]  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch.  You guys rock.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bit.  Oh, thank you.  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony.  So we could feel a little better about ourselves.  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea.  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboro box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah, there are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah, all right, well, I don't think Marlboro is in cahoots with the Klan.  This is the new and improved O.P. and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground.  We'll try not to.  We're going to say cut right there.  All right.  And end the bit.  End the bit.  Bravo to Anthony.  Bit is over.  Coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek?  The only time you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette. 
[00:15:30]  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times.  I was saying those were some...  Guy's like, how old are you?  No, I wasn't around during those.  Yeah, that's right.  Sure.  It's called a bit, silly.  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster.  We would go out and smoke.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:16:00]  Wow, you're about to hear a whole discussion on smoking and smoker freedom.  Ooh, one of our hard-hitting conversations, Opie, on the topic of smokers' freedoms and rights.  I talk about how I love how clean my clothes smell after a night out.  Is that what's written here?  Wow, that's riveting radio.  Can't wait.  Look out.  Woo!  Look out.  Ugh.  No, smoker freedom.  I'm sure this is very thought-provoking and funny at the same time.  You were goofing on my clothes.  Did you...  My thing on the clothes. 
[00:16:30]  Did you read your comment?  While Opie believes smokers shouldn't be told where they can smoke.  That's right.  Well, how did you reach the mic?  Did you get off your high horse and start talking into it?  I hate when we talk serious on this show.  It sounds like a political show.  So, conversation leads to talking about how we aren't as free in America as we think we are.  What it sounds like is we are the white trash hour, a bunch of boobs trying to be political 
[00:17:00]  and thinking that that's what freedom is.  Dude, you can't even fucking smoke in the hospital anymore!  A bunch of asses.  All we need in this conversation is Voss' stiff little hands talking.  Well, the liberals try to...  Voss is such a conservative, but he doesn't know what political correctness is.  Dude, the liberals don't want you...  Shut up!  His little hands get so stiff.  Take those little Davey from fucking Davey and Goliath fingers and just put a pistol in your mouth.  With that said, sit back and listen to us as we try to sound smart. 
[00:17:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Everything seems to be working today.  Really?  That's sort of a...  That's a blanket statement to make this early in the program, Opie.  Turn down the headphones a little bit and I'm ready to broadcast. 
[00:18:00]  There we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's getting so exciting.  Every day, more people jumping aboard, Anthony.  Turning on their XM satellite radios.  Welcome to you and yours for checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Welcome.  Brand new bunch of people.  We just got your XM radio and activated it.  Brand new people every day, Opie.  We are the true underdogs. 
[00:18:30]  We understand that.  We were on top of the world two years ago doing afternoon radio in many, many cities across America.  I remember that.  And then we were yanked off the air.  Yanked.  For a legal broadcast, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, morally, it wasn't good.  Oh, it was bad judgment.  We understand that now.  We learned.  Some people were very upset.  Very upset by our actions.  And then our old company held us to our contracts. 
[00:19:00]  Made us sit out for two years.  Took away everything we ever did.  So we got to start from scratch.  Brand new.  Everything's got to be new.  So we are the underdogs.  We understand that.  Eventually, hopefully sooner than later, this will be a well-oiled machine, Anthony.  Well-oiled?  Well-oiled?  You don't like that?  A well-oiled machine.  A well-oiled machine, right.  Oh, working out the bugs every day and adding bits every day.  New faces and old faces dropping in the studio every day. 
[00:19:30]  We're surely, but surely.  We're surely building the new O&A show.  And I can't be more excited than I am today.  I'm slowly building my favorites list on my computer.  For some reason, every day, the favorites that I mark off, because I like being able  to go from one web page to another.  Important little web pages, Opie, like Drudge Report and Fox News' page and things like  that, just to keep updated on current events and things that are happening.  And for some reason, it disappears on a daily basis. 
[00:20:00]  Things disappear around here.  As did you saw my new lighter that I had yesterday.  I got this brand new lighter.  That's gone.  Things are disappearing.  Yeah.  What does Ben need a lighter for?  You smoke?  No.  I got this brand new shortopia.  I only got a $50 lighter.  Oh, cigar.  I like smoking cigars.  I got it the other night.  I left it right here.  And it was gone.  Oh, there's still places to smoke in the city?  There's a few.  Really?  Yeah, there's one that's breaking the law right by the office here. 
[00:20:30]  But there's actually like 10 legal places.  I'm kind of, you know, when Mayor Bloomberg here in New York City first came out with this  smoking ban, I was like, no, man, fight the power, man.  You know, if people want to smoke, they should be allowed to.  Freedom, man.  Now, I don't want anyone smoking anywhere.  I'm horrible.  I'm one of those people.  You're smoking brains out.  I know, but I'm one of those people now where it's like it's kind of nice to go out and  come home and not have the whole house smell like your sweater because it's covered in 
[00:21:00]  smoke.  Well, this is what I don't understand.  And they're digging it now.  I don't understand this.  If you own a bar, okay, why aren't you allowed to let people smoke in your bar?  Because it's a legal substance.  Because the people that work there, that's what Bloomberg was saying, is the people that  work there shouldn't be subject.  They don't work in that bar.  Yeah, but, you know, that might be the job they can get.  I'm not a smoker.  And I'm like you, I'm glad that there's no smoking anymore because you can wear clothes  like more than once, things like that.  You can breathe, you know.  Yeah.  But I don't get that. 
[00:21:30]  You know, it's a legal substance that they're telling people you're not allowed to have  people smoking in your establishment.  I don't get that.  This is America.  They're saying it's a health threat.  Well, then when you're getting your workers, you know, on the application, do you mind  working in a smoking environment?  They shouldn't have to be subjected to that sort of smoke.  And then on top of that, all right, so we lost that battle, okay?  We lost that battle.  I get it.  And I hate smokers and I hate smoking, but I...  You hate smokers, too?  Well, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Just throw a blanket over everybody.  I'm sorry.  I hate the smoker.  All right.  I hate cigarette smoke, okay?  Made me stop gambling up in Mohegan Sun.  Went up there in Foxwoods.  Went to Foxwoods.  And they have a no smoking part of the casino, which is pretty cool.  Went in there, but they close it down at about two in the morning.  So then at two, I figure, ah, you know, I still want to do some gambling.  And I went into the smoking section.  Here's what you have to sit next to. 
[00:22:30]  Either some Asian guy or an Arab guy that is smoking, like, two at a time.  And the ashtray is right next to you.  And they're just blowing smoke.  And you can't breathe.  I mean, you cannot breathe.  So I had to leave the table after, like, ten minutes.  I couldn't lose any more money.  I was pissed.  There was a sports arena in Rochester that was smoke-free, except for one room that you were allowed to smoke in.  And the nickname of the place was called The Tomb.  The Tomb.  Yeah, sometimes in airports that you go to around the country, sometimes they have, like, a glass room. 
[00:23:00]  And you can watch the smokers throw it.  You can just watch them getting cancer.  It's amazing.  The whole room is just full of smoke.  Oh, there's vents at the top and filters and fans that aren't doing anything.  And you look in there and go, how could you even step in there?  Right.  You just stink.  You know, two things about the law.  What's funny is they can still sell cigarettes in restaurants that you can't smoke in.  You can still sell cigarettes, but you can't smoke them in there, which is weird.  Yeah, you could buy a pack for eight bucks or whatever the hell the going rate is now. 
[00:23:30]  All right, so we lost that battle.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Now, there's, like, cigar bars in New York that they're trying to close down.  The whole reason those places are open is so you could go and have a cigar.  Same principle.  And I don't smoke cigars either.  Yeah.  But that's the whole reason that these places are in business.  Yeah.  It's a place for people to go to smoke.  You're not stumbling into this place going, oh, my God, I didn't know people were going to be smoking in here.  Yeah.  Well, they say that the employees are in danger. 
[00:24:00]  But it doesn't make sense to me that they're allowed to shut down, you know, even smoking lounges.  Yeah, this is a place to go that's specifically for smoking.  Pretty much, yeah.  And they're shutting them down.  It's like little finger food, and they got their whiskeys and stuff and a full bar.  Yeah, like, that's fine, because I'm not going to go in there.  But most people go there to have a cigar, and they're trying to shut those places down.  I don't get that.  There's a place downtown called Hudson Bar and Books that you can't get into because you can still smoke there  because so much of their business is tobacco. 
[00:24:30]  But if, say, you go in there and smoke cigarettes, they charge you two bucks for every cigarette you smoke while you're in there.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  How do they know how many are smoking?  I think it's the honor system, but the place is packed.  You can't even get in there any night of the week.  How do they charge you?  Does somebody come up to you and say two bucks, or they give you a bill?  There's a sign when you walk in, and then there's a sign at every table, and there's a sign at the bar and everything, yeah.  Or if you bring in your own cigar, you know, because they sell it all in there.  I'm trying to figure out how they do it.  I think it's the honor system, you know.  I mean, how do you keep track of everyone smoking cigarettes? 
[00:25:00]  I mean, people, you know, write in the room.  Really?  Yeah, especially in a crowded room.  Wow, that's really weird.  What's the justification of two bucks?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Is it costing them money for you to come in there and smoke?  Well, because you're not buying the cigarettes there.  God, that's hysterical.  They should just allow smoking establishments.  This is supposed to be America, land of the free.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure there are a lot of smoke still in Iraq.  Yeah, yeah.  Iraq does seem to be a little more free than we are here.  Because you're not free to do a lot of things.  That's really the selling point of America has been for many years is, hey, you know, it's 
[00:25:30]  America, man.  We're free to do whatever you want to do.  It's a free country.  Thank God we're free to do.  And the truth of the matter is, you're really not free to do much of anything.  You're free to adhere to all of the rules.  That's what you're free to do.  There's more rules every day.  Every single day there's more rules in this country.  Every day, more rules.  The second they notice that you're free to do something, they have to regulate it. 
[00:26:00]  I remember reading about a month ago, there's some kind of way to atomize booze, to make  it like a mist, and you put this mask on, and you breathe in the booze.  I love that story.  It takes about 20 minutes to do a shot.  You sit back.  Now, 20 minutes to do a shot.  I could do like five shots in 20 minutes.  You're hanging out with your friends, drinking a few beers and stuff. 
[00:26:30]  So, it takes 20 minutes to inhale this shot.  And instead of going through your stomach, you're getting the effects like you would if  you smoked something.  It's a mister.  You know, it mists the booze.  And immediately, well, we need regulations against this.  This is horrible.  This is...  Now, why is it so bad?  You're drinking it or ingesting it slower than you would if you were drinking it.  Yeah, you're controlling your drinking.  But everyone freaked out because it's alcohol, and it's some new way to do it. 
[00:27:00]  So, well, no, no.  We got to figure out a way.  We got to see if this can still be picked up on the breathalyzer.  We got to figure out if this is dangerous.  We got to figure out if people need to be saved from this.  If the kids are going to start using it.  So, we need regulation.  You're really not free to do anything.  Stop regulating.  Yeah, please.  They're driving us nuts.  Are you free to, if you wanted to, on a whim, just go outside naked, outside your house, 
[00:27:30]  and sit on a chair in the sun on your front property that you own with nothing on?  A man can dream.  You know something?  You're absolutely not free to do that.  No.  You're free.  Can you just go outside in your backyard and start blasting off some rounds into a phone book in your backyard?  No.  You would get arrested.  You can't discharge firearms within the city limits unless it's in a perfect spot.  Let's go a little further.  Are you free to take up arms against the government? 
[00:28:00]  Well, that's why we have our right to bear arms open.  Yeah, that old gag.  Why don't you go outside right now and try to take up arms against the government and see what happens?  Get a little militia together?  Yeah, you and your cute little gun while they bring in the helicopters, you idiot.  The Apaches and the tanks come after you.  You know, we need it because it's a deterrent to the government.  Right.  We need an armed society just in case we have to take the government out.  Oh, really?  You're going to use your deer rifle against a howitzer? 
[00:28:30]  Really?  Do you have laser-guided missiles yet at your house?  From my cold, dead hands.  Oh, wait.  I have Alzheimer's.  From my cold, dead foot.  Isn't that the saying?  I forgot.  Yeah, so you really, you know, it's a great selling point for the country.  And when the immigrants want to come over and become American, it's a great selling point.  Hey, you're free to do everything.  Slow down. 
[00:29:00]  Slow down.  Because you're really not free to do much of anything.  Everything is regulated.  Everything costs money.  You can't just buy a car and start driving in a free country.  Shouldn't you be able to take your money that you earned and buy a car and just jump in it and start driving?  You should.  But no.  You need a license.  You have to register it.  You have to inspect it.  It's got to, you know, you've got to adhere to all the rules on the road.  And if you screw up, they can take all that away from you. 
[00:29:30]  I bet you in Iraq you could just find one of those old Toyotas and just start driving around.  An old Datsun pickup with a machine gun in the back.  You don't have to worry about registration.  I'm driving, my friend.  I'm driving.  I am truly free, my friend.  I'm driving.  You're free.  Now, Iraq.  You think they've got car insurance in Iraq?  Iraq is a freer country right now than the United States of America.  It's also like the wild, wild west over there, but which was a great time in America, too, from what I read. 
[00:30:00]  I seem to, I think it was fun.  You could just get your horse, you ride out west, and pan for gold, Opie.  And if somebody wanted your gold, they'd try to shoot you.  And you shoot back at them, and if you kill them, hey, you're out of danger for a day or two.  There was a time, if you liked a piece of land, you just started living there.  You would stake your claim.  You know that river near your house?  Try to, like, just build a house there on your own.  Yeah.  If you see a nice piece of property that you like right by your house, why not just lay down some walls and a roof on it and start living there and see what happens to you? 
[00:30:30]  Let's test this freedom thing today.  Try that one out.  Build a house on a nice piece of land by a river.  Till the ground.  And grow the corn.  And screw go to Home Depot.  Just start chopping down the trees and make your own log cabin.  Call yourself Paw Ingles.  Right.  And just build a soddy by the river.  Hey, you could save a lot of money.  Give it a try.  See what happens in the land of the free. 
[00:31:00]  Take your buckboard into Sleepy Eye for some supplies and go back to the house you just built.  Right.  See what happens.  See if there's someone waiting there for you.  Hey, what happened?  I just built my house by Plum Creek.  I figured I'd live here.  It's a nice plot of land.  Yeah.  It's a free country, isn't it?  Oh, it sure is.  It sure is.  I think you'd have some marshals there.  You think?  Your goods would be out and there'd be a big lock on the door of the house that you built. 
[00:31:30]  There's no real freedom like that in the way that, you know, it was many, many years ago.  They regulate everything.  You're not free to do anything.  You go to work.  You have to go to work every day to live in this country.  You can't not work and live in the United States of America.  You can't not work?  Have you walked around lately in the city?  And look and see what it is.  It's homeless people.  They're dregs of society in this country. 
[00:32:00]  They're the outcasts, the people that you don't want around.  You can't just do that.  And you have to worry.  You've got to pay your taxes.  Right.  That's not free.  You make money and it's a 50% cut with the government.  They're your partner.  We're in it together, partner.  You know, that doesn't sound very free.  I mean, of course, people are going to say, well, look at the alternatives.  Yeah, I don't want to live in Iraq.  I don't want to live in a lot of countries that aren't free.  But don't be delusional and think you live in this great free nation where you are free to do anything and pursue these dreams and hopes. 
[00:32:30]  No, you're really not.  Food prices are out of control.  Why don't you go collect your own food?  Hunt for your own food.  Why don't you give that a shot to see how free we really are?  And what?  You have to only be hungry during hunting season?  Is that what it is?  No, I'm hungry.  You know something?  As you're driving down...  I'm hungry right now and I like bear for dinner.  Right.  I want a little tasty bear meat. 
[00:33:00]  I'm going to go out and get a bear today.  You know something?  I drive down the highways and byways of this great nation of ours, Opie,  and a lot of times you'll see a deer on the side of the road.  You're right.  Right.  Pull over, pull out your rifle, and take a bead on his little deer head and just blast it off.  Now throw it on your fender, whatever it is, and take him home.  That's some good eating.  What's going to happen if you get caught with that deer?  You're going to be fined, if not arrested, for blasting off your rifle at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
[00:33:30]  It doesn't seem truly free to me like that.  Why are we talking about freedom today?  How did it start?  I don't know.  I think, are we free to run this station without an Oompa Loompa?  I think that's probably how it started.  Oh, that's how it started.  I don't know.  Let's face it.

[00:35:00]  How would you like to have your toilet fixed by a plumber without a plumber ever coming into your house?  Well, that would be called Plumber's Choice.

[00:36:00]  888-PLUM-HELP.  XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Ah, Norton and Escorts.  One of my favorite topics on the show.  Love it.  And a frequent one.  It's a frequent one, but we haven't gone down this road lately, I was just thinking.  This was any guy's dream come true.  An hour with Natalia, the number one call girl.  What are you going to call her?  Hooker.  What did you call her in New York City?  I call him Hues.  And not only was he with her, but he's with her for free. 
[00:36:30]  A freebie.  Nice.  Didn't you get sick after you were with her?  Oh, I got a bad cold, or she got a cold.  One of us got a cold.  No, you got a cold, and we said it was because you were licking her ass.  Oh, right, right, right.  I believe we discussed that.  Stay tuned to this segment for ass-licking fun.  That's right.  That's right.  Old Butterscotch Jim.  The aristocrat and how I lived it with Natalia.  We got to talk about Jim Norton here. 
[00:37:00]  That's what I want to hear.  I want to hear how everything went.  Yeah, a lot of uncomfortable people in Washington yesterday.  Really?  Well, we had escorts in the studio yesterday.  Yeah.  And they did some great radio for us.  What was the name of the website again?  nyconfidential.com.  nyconfidential.com.  And you want to see some hot chicks?  Let's go on that site.  Holy cow.  Yeah, and we found out that the girls on the website are the ones that come to your door.  Oh, yeah.  You know, because Norton, you know, we're learning a lot about, I don't want to say that word. 
[00:37:30]  About the scene, man.  Yeah, we're learning a lot about the ladies of the night.  Escorts and how you get them and how you act when they come to your door and how they're paid for and all that fun stuff.  Jimmy is a pro.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were talking about bait and switch and stuff.  You see a beautiful girl in one of these advertisements, and it's not the girl that comes to your door.  Yeah, it happens all the time.  Actual photo.  And it is an actual photo, but just not of the girl that shows up. 
[00:38:00]  Not of the girl.  Yeah, so nyconfidential.com, these girls.  Didn't that happen in risky business?  Tom Cruise called up for an escort.  I don't think he was looking at...  Oh, there was no picture?  I don't think he was looking...  But then the black guy came to the door?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he had to pay him.  Jackie.  Her name was Jackie.  Yeah.  Jackie.  Jackie.  The bait and switch.  But they don't do the bait and switch with nyconfidential.com.  I mean, the girls showed up that were on the website. 
[00:38:30]  They were unbelievable.  And we set up a little date for Jim Norton.  Actually, we all get our free hour.  I heard we all get an hour.  We all get an hour, and so far...  I don't know how many people are going to admit they used their free hour.  I know one has so far.  You can bet I have, and I'm looking for your free hours to be donated.  Donated to you, right?  Gobble them up.  You'll gobble up all the free hours?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Dude, yeah.  I still have boxes to unpack in my house.  I was wondering if one could come over and help me just unpack. 
[00:39:00]  Right, right.  Maybe that.  No, it's funny.  Yard work.  I don't know.  We all get free hours, and when I just mentioned that, everyone that works for the show just  were...  They all started looking very busy and looking down, and all of a sudden, they're checking  knobs and stuff.  Yes, I'm working hard.  Please.  Please don't look my way.  So, Norton did use his free hour.  Yeah.  It was great.  I was kind of hoping, in a weird way, that it would be awkward or something, so I could  goof on it, because it would be funnier. 
[00:39:30]  Rave review?  I'm honest when I tell you, I can't tell you how long I've been doing this, probably  since I was 20, and I'm 36.  Two thumbs in.  I gave it a fist up.  It was the best escort experience I've ever had.  Wow.  Now, coming from you, all over her.  That spends well over $20,000 to $30,000 a year on this.  Yeah.  On your little hobby.  Best escort experience ever.  I talked to the guy, Jason, who runs the place, and I think he's the owner, and we're 
[00:40:00]  talking, and he wanted me to come into their place.  I think he's like, I was, he was kind of worried, he said that somebody else would call pretending  to be me, and have the girl just go there.  Uh-huh.  You know, which is actually a pretty smart move, if any of you dummies would have thought  of that.  Wow, imagine that.  Yeah, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Come down here.  How will I know it's you?  I have a weak chin and tits and no body hair.  All right, that could be half of New York.  The lights will be out.  Just walk in and start sucking.  Wait a minute, someone might be using my free hour right now, and I don't even know it.  Yeah, some blonde guy with great abs and a keen smile.  Ladies, be careful.  Just because he has sandy blonde hair and a nice smile. 
[00:40:30]  No, it's a guyless.  And, uh...  Like the guyless smile.  Guyless smile.  What's that mean?  I have...  It was...  I don't know.  Penetrating blue eyes.  I don't know.  It was in one of these stupid articles.  Opie with his guyless smile.  Smile?  G-U-I-L-E-S-L.  Oh, guyless.  Guileless.  There's no guile to your smile.  No guile at all.  All right, whatever.  So...  I don't know what that means.  All right, so we went off the air yesterday, and the lovely ladies left, and, uh, well,  we all went out to breakfast and stuff, so then what happened? 
[00:41:00]  Um...  Take us through this, step by step, Jimmy.  I, uh...  I wind up calling the, uh, place, and I talk to Jason, and he has me...  I go down into, uh, let's just say Tribeca, the place was, and I arrive at promptly 3.30.  I'm never on time, but I was...  Wait, is it an actual house?  Well, not in Manhattan.  It's not a house.  Well, you know what I mean, but is it like a...  It's, it's, uh, uh, it's like in a loft, in a big building in a loft.  Okay.  With just a lot of rooms? 
[00:41:30]  Um, well, I didn't know until I rang the bell, and I was, uh, met the gentleman at the door,  and it was, there's a grand piano inside when you walk in.  There's like a big...  Oh, that says classy joint.  Big screen TV on the wall.  Hmm.  I mean, unbelievable.  It's like, it's, you know, it's money.  Um, hot chicks all over the place.  And then he's showing me around.  He walk in, that girl Katie that we saw the day was sleeping in bed.  He takes me into her room.  He doesn't care that she's sleeping.  He's like, yeah, this is one of the rooms.  The girl's like, uh.  He's asleep in there. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, this guy's great.  He's drinking scotch.  He just didn't give a shit.  Say hi to Jim.  You know, hi.  You know, she wants to cut my throat and kick me, but she's like, hi.  She's just trying to take a nap in between clients?  She's just trying to relax.  Take a load off, and he walks in with a scotch.  Load off.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And then they take me into this, uh.  Does he have a pipe in a, in a, in a bathroom?  Oh, no.  He was wearing a short sleeve.  No, no.  He's actually, he looks like, actually, like, an Israeli soldier.  He's like, like, his short hair and a tattoo.  And he's, obviously, yeah, he's a psychopath. 
[00:42:30]  And, uh.  And he, and he takes me into, uh, the other room.  And, and, and Natalia, the girl who was in here, runs out naked out of the shower and  goes, hi.  And jumps into my arms.  Jumps into my arms and hugs me.  It was like an officer and a gentleman moment.  With a hot chick.  Except I don't look like a military serviceman.  It was exactly what it was like.  Way to go, Natalia.  You go.  Oh, she kisses me.  I mean, it was so surreal.  Because I'm, I, usually when you go, I'm, I, they, you never feel like they like you. 
[00:43:00]  We're not going to find you dead when you realize that she doesn't really like you, are  we?  Dude, I think she does.  Oh, you pathetic man.  I think she does.  Oh, we got one of those guys on, working for the show.  I go out, he's, he's, you're the guy, you're the guy that goes to the strip club and, and  is convinced that the girl wants to go home with you.  Dude, she digs me, man.  Yeah.  I could tell.  No, you guys go ahead, man.  I'll, I'm staying.  I'll, I'll figure out how to get back to Long Island.  She's giving me a different vibe than she's giving you guys. 
[00:43:30]  Face it.  By the way, you got a couple hundred bucks on, I ran out.  I, I already spent 500, but I, I think I got her number now, man.  You know, I slip her in 20s, man, because, you know, that, she, because she likes me.  Yeah, you guys just take the limo.  I'll, I don't know, I'll, I'll go down to Penn Station and take the Long Island Railroad  home.  Yeah.  I need it.  I'm cutting out with this chick, man.  You know who did that?  Psycho Mark.  Oh, right, right.  At one of the bachelor parties we went to.  He was convinced the girl loved him.  This girl loves me.  How much did he end up spending?  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  Do you know who I am? 
[00:44:00]  This chick digs me.  He swore that this girl was falling in love with him right there.  What an idiot.  Uh-uh.  There's always one.  Not, not accusing you.  No, I don't.  But you really think this girl.  See, they're very, they're very, I guess because they make good money or whatever, but they're  very genuine.  Like, I've dated so much.  I know that, you know, I'm just a guy, but if you're nice, if you're like, you're respectful,  they're going to treat you very well.  So she jumps on my arm, gives me a kiss.  I'm going to hook up with this other Canadian girl who's a 10.  And he goes, why don't you have both? 
[00:44:30]  And I'm like, uh, I don't want to be Gary Greedy.  I'm like, I don't know.  Because usually I like one.  He's like, go ahead.  Hang out with both.  They're both great.  He's like, trust me.  Trust me.  So I go and I sit in the couch and I'm talking to one.  Another girl walks in.  He goes, hey, lift up your skirt.  And she lifts up her skirt and he lets me smell.  He's like, go ahead, smell.  Smell it.  Smell her.  What?  Yeah.  He's like, it's the nicest one.  So I smell it.  Are you kidding?  No.  And then I go into the, uh, the black chick comes in, this chick named Midnight.  So there's just hot chicks walking around. 
[00:45:00]  Dude, it's depressing.  Are they in lingerie?  Uh, the one Natalia was, Midnight, he made get naked for me.  He takes me to the room.  Midnight has to be the black chick, right?  I don't think that's her real name, though.  I didn't want to, I don't, I don't think so.  Um, but the, she had, I'm not exaggerating, the nicest ass I've ever seen on a human being  was on this chick.  It was, it was fucking amazing.  So I take Natalia, I'm very happy, we're kissing and hugging.  So wait.  Oh my goodness.  You're kissing and hugging?  Mouth kissing.  Yeah, nicely. 
[00:45:30]  Girlfriend experience.  Girlfriend experience.  Okay.  Girlfriend experience.  I had never heard of that before the other day.  I'm trying to get the visual a little better, alright?  Okay.  So you're in the, it's the penthouse area and girls are walking around half naked, blah,  blah, blah, and you're sniffing and checking them out and stuff.  So then you decide on the girl that was in here?  Yeah, only because the other girl, we, we, I'm talking to the owner, he's a fan of the  show.  No, they're all great.  I'm just, alright.  No, no, I'm saying the guy that we were rapping with, we were talking for like 45 minutes, the other  girl had another gig to go to.  She had a job to do.  So she was like, it was running late, but that was my fault just for yapping with him.  So I could, I, the, the one girl I was supposed to see had to go. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  45 minutes later.  So I didn't care.  I was like, oh, I'm in Italia.  Alright, so.  We're all tense.  Who cares?  So now she just kind of grabs your hand and you walk off?  Yeah, we walk into the next room.  There's a king-sized bed with like a, a foot of like the, the fluffy foam on it.  It's phenomenal, dude.  It's like a five-star hotel.  The only thing wrong with the picture was my stomach and tits.  The fact that I had to be unclothed.  And she was really digging you.  So what else was in the room?  Satin sheets.  I mean, it was, no, just a king-sized bed with big pillows. 
[00:46:30]  There's a huge, like, a sunroof, like sky roof.  What do they call that?  Skylight.  Skylight.  Yeah, the whole, the whole roof is like a, is like a glass.  Really?  Yeah.  So there's like, I was kind of hoping it was like, like a darker room.  Again, I'm embarrassed to get naked.  Yeah, I know.  That's like daylight coming in on you.  But it, that would be perfect at like nine o'clock at night when you had the city lights.  Or if you were in some kind of physical shape like a man.  So I get naked.  In the daytime, Jimmy just gets an ass burn from the sunlight coming through.  So you, so you lock the door, whatever, close the door. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Can you hear that?  Oh, oh, yeah.  There's music blasting through.  The Sinatra playing.  It wasn't Sinatra.  It wasn't Sinatra, it wasn't?  I swear to God.  Oomph.  Oh, blue eyes.  Better than that.  The, the, the, the, the, the, the CD player in the room wasn't working.  We were going to listen to some, something.  Sinatra blasting through in the middle of it.  I hear the song, um, uh, forget me not.  I didn't know that was the Sinatra song.  Oh, no, really?  No way.  Yeah, I'm trying to get Hummer and I hear this song blasting through.  Oh, man.  So we start off making out. 
[00:47:30]  Distraction?  Yeah, it really was.  But I wanted the Sinatra instead of the Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  Start spreading your legs.  Jim's coming today.  Just grab my meaty tits.  I'm gonna get laid.  This chick's digging me.  I want to be.  Yeah, baby.  Look at my flabby ass. 
[00:48:00]  That's right, toots.  Did you call it toots with the music playing?  No, it was very gentlemanly.  You got nice stems, dame.  No?  Nothing like that?  Now do they have a bar, like, for martinis and things like that?  Oh, yeah, whatever you want.  They'll bring you, they'll bring you.  See, if you'd like it, you can get alcohol.  Yeah, they were really, really odd.  Get me a scotch, friend.  They were very accommodating with alcohol, whatever you want, which I don't drink. 
[00:48:30]  I'm king of the hill.  Open up, honey.  I'm sinking it deep.  No?  These little times.  Wow.  All right, so you're in the room.  The Sinatra's playing.  Yeah, and...  Now, what's the first move?  Yeah.  You start making out.  What is she wearing now, like lingerie?  She's wearing thigh-highs with garters.  Right.  Um, like, like lingerie, just dirty, naughty.  Jimmy then made a fort out of the blanket.  Let's make a fort. 
[00:49:00]  No?  No.  So when did you lay...  So when did you lay down the tarp?  Yeah.  And the plastic.  And the plastic.  Yeah, there were no toilet games.  There was no temple.  Did they supply the plastic and the duct tape to...  It was a very nice experience.  See, this is what confuses me about Jimmy.  You like the nice experiences, and then you also like to get really dirty with this thing.  Yeah, you can't...  I just couldn't have asked a girl.  She was too hot and too nice and kissing me like a girlfriend.  You're going for the girlfriend experience, not the mother experience. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I couldn't, you know...  Hey, listen, I know we're kissing and getting along, but, you know, if you have to go,  just, you know, put a finger up and I'll lay on the bathroom floor.  Just, I don't want to kill the mood.  I felt it would be inappropriate to mention that.  So you didn't have to lay down any plastic.  No, it was one of the most normal ones I've had.  So we're kissing, and it's going very well, and then she lays me back.  Is she saying anything to you?  Um, no, but she's...  If she...  Look, I have to assume at any time an escort is with you that they're kind of, like, acting as well.  But they should have handed her a trophy when she was finished.  You really thought she liked you? 
[00:50:00]  Really?  It was unbelievable.  But that's how they get you to come back.  Well, it worked.  I can't believe it.  You're a hooker!  And I thought I was doing well with you.  We're kissing.  I perform oral treats on her.  I can't believe you're a hooker!  It was wonderful.  How much for the two of you. 
[00:50:30]  I believe...  I think you really like me.  I'm a pathetic little mess with meaty breasts.  She's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think she wants some cheese?  You really thought she liked you.  Dude.  That's amazing.  It was...  She was that good.  She was giving me a hummer. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  A hummer!  This story just seems this much better with this music.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Nice background music.  And Jim may have came while you were yelling.  It's a very small country.  This one's a goner.  This penis is a goner.  So we're kissing.  Yeah.  And we're having sex after a while.  You know?  And I had a bag on, unfortunately. 
[00:51:30]  I tried to kind of get cute and slip it, but...  Yeah.  I was wearing a bag and...  Alright, so...  Well, you guys...  I mean, this is step by step.  So you guys are making out and stuff, and you're feeling her up and things like that,  and then...  I find that weird, like, after sitting with her in the studio here and having to negotiate,  you know, things like the wiffle ball bat thing, and, you know, hey, could you take  your clothes off and stuff?  And then you're in a room, and you know you're going to town.  She was so cool, man.  It was...  Yeah.  I can't...  I really...  I almost wanted to come in.  I wish I kind of had a bad experience, because it's funnier, but it was unbelievable. 
[00:52:00]  I would never have been that happy with a date like that.  No, yeah.  Okay, continue.  So we're kissing, and she starts to...  You know, I lay back.  I perform oral treats on her.  You did?  Of course.  Front and back.  Oh, my God.  The whole kit and caboodle.  Now, are you...  How do you know she hasn't been with somebody else, like...  You're too clean.  You can't.  It's cleaner than a chick you meet in a club, because they use protection for almost everything  you do.  You tell yourself that.  You keep telling yourself that.  Well, you know, I don't care. 
[00:52:30]  Look, she should have been worried, but I wasn't.  So you pulled a dog-meeting dog with each other.  I was on...  Yeah.  So she goes...  It's actually a good way to look at it.  Spinning around in circles on the floor, sniffing ass.  Yeah?  Right.  So I go down on her, and she's going down on me, and then she climbs up, and she's kissing  me, and it just...  It's so nice.  And then she puts a bag on me, and she sits on my...  Did you need any help?  What?  Did you take anything? 
[00:53:00]  No.  No, what did I have taken?  Like the Viagra and all that?  Oh, no, no, no.  I knew I wouldn't need it.  Did you look at her?  No.  These are all tens.  You take that with a five.  Yeah.  You know, a five, or someone who's kind of fat, who's coming over.  But this one was phenomenal.  So she did the lay you on your back, and she mounted you like that?  Yeah.  And it was hot.  Wow.  Kissing.  I can't...  I'm playing with my own nipples, and she didn't look at me weird.  That's how I know she was good.  I'm toying with my nipples, old praying mantis fingers.  And she's still riding it like she's enjoying herself. 
[00:53:30]  You know, I've heard you bring that up a lot.  I don't get that.  What, the nipple thing?  Yeah.  It feels good.  Yeah, but it looks stupid, though.  I don't care.  It looks stupid.  No matter what I do in bed, I look awful.  There may be things that feel good, but you're not going to break it out of your repertoire  if you know it looks stupid.  Well, I had to.  I was on my back, so it wasn't as awkward.  Because people can't see at home.  Even when you show what you do, look, this is me doing it.  Look how awful this is.  I'm laying on my back, and my right hand is toying with my right nipple, and my left hand  is toying with my left nipple. 
[00:54:00]  Wouldn't you rather toy with hers?  I did toy with hers.  Oh, she kept taking my hands, and when she was going down on me, she kept taking my hand  and putting it in her hair to hold her head.  That was kind of hot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's one of the hottest things.  So I was holding the hair, and she was encouraging it, and I would push the head down a little,  and she would go, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Did she just do a little, uh-huh?  Um, no.  You'd take the phone off of the dresser and just wail it against the side of her head?  No, this isn't Midnight Cowboy.  I wasn't calling anyone, Joe.  You're a lovely person.  You're a lovely person.  Oh, hello, mother. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, I got a sick kid, mister.  Oh, I loathe life.  I loathe it.  All right, so you guys are really getting into it now.  Yeah, and then we're having sex, and she said one of the sexiest things ever.  Many different positions, or did you just?  No, I was, she was on top of me, and then she gets, she's like, come on, get behind me.  So I get behind her, and she's going crazy.  Again, is she enjoying it?  The only reason I doubted it is because I know my own performance is normally horrendous. 
[00:55:00]  It was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Wow, that's a rousing endorsement.  So I'm holding her hips, and I'm getting close,  and then she looks back and goes, uh, do you want to come in my mouth?  Hey!  Hey!  How about that?  How about that, yes.  It's the sexiest thing anybody has ever said to me.  So I say, yeah, I'd like that.  Okay.  And the worst thing, I lay back.  Well, sure.  Yanks the bag off, starts going. 
[00:55:30]  Wow, what a trooper.  What a good egg.  And the whole thing, as this is happening, I'm afraid I'm going to fart.  I had a fart built up that I was afraid it was going to shoot out while I came, but it didn't.  You don't want to do that.  And I did, and...  Oh, my God.  And it was unbelievable.  And a mouthful of Captain Trips.  Mouthful of plague.  And then what happens after that?  Then you're just laying there...  She cuddled.  What? 
[00:56:00]  She cuddled.  With who?  Me?  Oh.  I thought there was someone else in the room.  No, a real man came in for some cuddling.  I'll cuddle with you now.  How long was it?  The whole experience?  Over an hour.  Well, I was there for like two and a half hours.  No, but I mean, after you went into the room.  Oh, probably an hour, a little over an hour.  He was banging cocktail wages just two at a time.  Yeah, his machine needs to be a little higher, I think, if we could take care of that.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Wow.  Awesome.  I just...  It was unbelievable.  He was going to give me two, but I was like, I don't want to be greedy. 
[00:56:30]  And then he kissed her on the cheek, and then...  Well, on the mouth.  No, I'm just kidding.  And then...  Taste your own seed.  I didn't care.  And then I must have called you minutes after you were done, because I've never heard you...  I wish I'd taped it.  You were so mellow.  I was really happy.  You're just like, wow, man.  Because you don't feel rushed.  You don't feel any pressure.  It was fantastic.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What an endorsement.  I really mean it, too.  And, uh...  It's a very sincere endorsement.  NYconfidential.com.  Fantastic.  For your girlfriend experience's needs. 
[00:57:00]  Wait.  Girlfriend experience's needs.  Girlfriend experience.  They're upper-class girls, though.  They're not like the type of girls I would normally call, because they're just...  You know?  They're above right.  So it's a little more higher-end than you're used to getting.  Yeah, lawyers and...  Yeah, absolutely.  You know?  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Long Island.  Hey, Chris.  What's up, boys?  Jimmy, how is her lips?  Something close and personal.  You mean the lower ones?  Oh, yeah.  They were fat and perfect.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Yeah, it really was.  It was like Angelina Jolie's face. 
[00:57:30]  Like, that's how...  Those are the type of thick, lovely...  Did she get engorged?  She was when she got her thing off.  Swollen.  Yeah.  Very, very nice.  Do you think she was turned on at all?  I mean, you're a smart guy.  I know.  I mean, come on.  I mean, was she acting, or was there part of it she was definitely turned on by the experience?  I think that she was.  I mean, again, look at me.  I mean, any time, if I would say no, it would just be a reflection on my own awfulness.  But she got wet.  I mean, you know, not to be too nasty, but she really did, and that's something you really 
[00:58:00]  can't fake.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Well, no, it's hard to think.  Sure, they can.  How can they, though?  Let's go to Rico.  Hey, Rico.  I'm so jaded.  I just think they're all business.  Hey.  I know.  I've always thought that, too.  And I've dated...  Believe me, I've been on a thousand dates.  Yeah.  So I always know, ah, it's been...  But...  All right.  Dates.  Makes it sound like they're going to the malt shop in a movie.  You could do that if you like.  We're on a date.  It's not much of a difference at times, though.  Rico.  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Hey.  Hey, Norton. 
[00:58:30]  I was just wondering if she had a chance to smell your belly button.  If she did, did you get pictures of her puking?  No, sir.  There was no belly button sniffing.  And this is how stupid Bob Kelly is.  He comes up to me while I'm talking to a girl and her friend, and he goes,  Dude, let him smell your belly button while I'm talking to a chick.  And I'm like, what?  He goes, Dude, don't you wash your belly button?  Cockblocker.  But he didn't mean to be a cockblocker.  Bob's just dumb.  We have a lot of questions coming in.  Let's go to Tim in New Jersey.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, fellas? 
[00:59:00]  Hi, Tim in Jersey.  Well, it's Tim in Jersey, and he's calling the show.  Hey, what's up, man?  We've got to get this girl to call the show, by the way.  Is she up?  She's probably not up, right?  I don't know.  And then Jason said that they would call.  When do they start their work day?  I honestly don't know what time they open.  I think they're 24-7, so there should be somebody there.  Yeah, I already talked to them.  She was asleep.  She's asleep?  Does she sleep there?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, go ahead.  Why would you kiss a stripper?  That's like kissing a Komodo dragon.  There's so many diseases and bacteria and that shit.  That's not true, sir. 
[00:59:30]  It's not true.  Oh, come on.  No?  No.  It's just kissing.  Who cares?  I have an immune system.  She said, what, you mean, a cold?  Oh, yeah?  Well, I'm going to give you AIDS.  What?  I just gave you AIDS.  Sir?  Hello?  Yeah, he's gone.  Why?  I don't know.  So Frank Sinatra was singing this song.  Yeah, in the middle of my sex. 
[01:00:00]  You make me feel so young.  It really was funny.  You make me feel so spring as sprung.  Spring as sprung.  Look where I'm putting my tongue in your bun.  And he doesn't care.  Sniffing.  Did you?  Of course I did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big sniff.  Yeah, right in there.  With my meat.  I want to go and bounce the moon.  Oh, yeah.  You were bouncing, all right. 
[01:00:30]  Toy balloon on his schlong.  I did nothing.  I just laid there.  She took a moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just like a couple of tots.  Couple of tots.  Running across the metal.  Drink my jizz.  We were like a couple of tots.  Watch as your jawbone rots.  We were like a couple of tots.  The type that are featured on Gary Glitter's computer.  If you go to the website, Natalia is the one, by the way. 
[01:01:00]  She's beautiful.  Jason from Boston.  It's called shampooing when you rub the girl's head while she's blowing you.  Oh, shampooing.  I've never heard that one before.  And then she gets a mouth full of cream rinse.  Yeah.  So young.  This is sent in by Natalie.  Natalie wants to talk about Jim Norton's conscience.  Seriously, Jim, none of that treatment had anything to do with the fact that you were going to talk about this on satellite radio,  which is broadcasted all over the country. 
[01:01:30]  Well, you could look at it like that if you were Jim Norton on the rusty trombone, everyone.  Jim Norton.  Henchman from Brooklyn.  They know Jimmy's addiction and they want to be his main pusher.  Yeah, they gave you the first one for free, man.  It's over, Johnny.  Because I was talking to Jim.  I'm like, this is way too dangerous because he already spends a lot of money on this service.  Yes.  You're not even going to go back to the old way.  You're going to be calling these people like crazy.  Dope, man.  Dope, man.  And I know they're going to be giving, you know, they're going to help you out. 
[01:02:00]  But after a while, though, man, you're going to be spending some serious cash.  You get addicted on the treatment.  You really do.  On the whole nice hand-holding thing.  You seem to be into that whole thing of the kissing and hugging.  At times, yes.  So I don't understand why you don't get a girlfriend.  Because, first of all, girlfriends don't do things as well as this girl did.  I mean, at least none I've ever had. 
[01:02:30]  I mean, they're nice, but...  Right.  And you're also paying for the instantaneous stuff you're getting.  Like, the hand-holding...  Like, that's the type of girl you'd see.  You'd see her out, and you'd want to touch her or whatever, but you can't.  You understand what I mean?  That's, to me, what...  It's not just sex.  It's the whole thing of the kissing and the whole touching.  You know what?  The way you just...  Someone I shouldn't be able to kiss and touch.  The way you describe it sounds just like a serial killer talking about murder.  Like, they talk about it the same way.  It's very rational in their head.  No, no.  See, when I strangle someone, and then I disembowel them, it's because I look at them and want 
[01:03:00]  to do it, and you're like a crazy person.  But, yeah, I mean, I'm addicted.  I'm definitely addicted, but...  Yeah, you are.  Believe me, there's 80% or 70% of my experiences are horrendous that I've had.  Really?  Awful.  You feel like you didn't get your money's worth?  You know, one did just terrible.  Could have just jacked it at home, and...  I told you that...  Oh, yeah, I already told that story, but the two girls in L.A.  I just had so many bad ones, ones that smell, stretch marks, fats. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Just awful.  I told you one time in New Brunswick, in Jersey, I had a pregnant one in my parents' basement  in the room my grandmother had lived in before a fatal heart attack.  Oh, great.  That's what you want.  And this pregnant chick sparks up a crack pipe.  I swear to God, seven and a half months pregnant, she sparks up a crack pipe in my grandmother's  old living room.  You've come a long way.  Yeah.  That's a true story.  A pregnant crack whore.  You don't understand the disasters I've hooked up with.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Or the awful ones I've had. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Well, that's great.  Nice.  There's the review right there.  Very good review.  Yeah, nyconfidential.com.  And I wish I could...  For your girlfriend experiences.  I wish I could goof on it, but God damn it, I couldn't.  No.  I'm very happy for you, Jimmy.  Honestly, this is better than goofing on it.  This is pretty interesting.  Yeah.  I'm not giving away my free hour anymore.  And I'm normally for white girls.  Not that I'm a racist, but I normally go for white girls.  Yeah.  It's just what I like, you know, because of the whole superiority thing and the fact that  we're God's people. 
[01:04:30]  No, it was...  But he showed me this black girl and the ass was so...  It was almost like a painting of an ass.  It was so smooth and pretty.  You ever see an ass so nice it gets you angry?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Could you get me the bell and the wacky horn?  Yeah, we need our props.  For what?  Nice picking up on those hand signals, Kev.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Little Jimmy, you ruined it for all of us.  Why?  Definitely not going for Natalia now. 
[01:05:00]  Ah, that's right.  You just took her out of the equation.  Oh.  Because, I mean, you're making it all nice and stuff, but you've told way too many stories  on the show, so she's now out of the equation.  Well, I'm clean, though.  I'm very clean.  I just got tested about three months ago.  Yeah, in three months.  Norton will call all his friends every three months and tell everybody that, you know,  he passed his test.  He gets very excited.  Passed his AIDS test.  Yeah.  I don't think I have AIDS.  I'm not into taking things in the rump.  How many times have you called your friends to say, you know, you pass?  You get very excited on that day. 
[01:05:30]  You have to.  Yeah, you always get nervous.  Yes, Ben?  He came up to me in Boston.  He goes, dude, I just tested negative.  It's a great day.  You know, you were all excited?  Dude, I had a red ring on my chest.  Go out for another three months and try again?  Yeah.  I feel like I'm failing.  Hey, maybe I'll get it next time.  I had a red ring on my chest, and I thought I had one escort, actually a dominatrix who  was going to use me as a toilet, tell me she thought it was ringworm.  So I was like, well, panicking.  I'm like, you know, I'm a 36-year-old white guy.  I have African child disease.  Yeah, ringworm.  But I didn't. 
[01:06:00]  It turned out to be an allergic reaction to laundry detergent, but I thought it might  be AIDS.  I was panicked.  Panicked, dude.  So I went to the doctor and he tested.  He's like, you don't have AIDS.  I'm like, just test me.  Hep, AIDS, everything I tested for.  Totally clean.  You didn't get to play Monster Rain yesterday, huh?  No, we didn't play Monster Rain.  They don't have the Monster Rain service?  No.  At NY Confidential.  Sounds like they did.  Sounds like they did everything that you would do while playing Monster Rain.  Well, no, I think Monster Rain is with another guy, though.  All the SIG pics are flying up.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Yeah, there's, what's his name again?  Cage from whackbag.com. 
[01:06:30]  You go to opianthony.com.  This guy's photoshopping as we go.  Yeah.  We do a subject on the show and he's photoshopping stuff and making it very, very funny.  They got you as Prince in Purple Rain and it says Monster Rain.  Very funny.  I didn't see opianthony.com to check that stuff out.  Yes, Anthony.  Instant feedback.  Norton, of course, she got wet.  Stick $1,200 under any chick's nose and tell her that an hour and many tears later,  it's all hers, and see if she gets wet an hour and many tears later. 
[01:07:00]  I really want to, I hope she's honest with us.  I hope she's honest with us.  I think she will be.  I think she's going to give us the company line.  I really want to.  I think she'll be all nice and say, yeah, Jimmy was great.  Maybe, Jimmy, I tell you, I was packing 14 yesterday.  My rod was very lovely.  Really?  Very impressive.  Yeah.  We'll get some stuff out of her, but I think in general.  Yeah, we'll get some stuff out of her, all right?  Everything Jimmy put in her, it's still coming out of her.  Squeezing like a toothpaste tube.  I just come out. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, Anthony, what's up?  Not too much.  How you doing?  That old gag.  What's going on, bud?  Anthony from Long Island, go.  I'm here.  I'm here.  Listen, Jimmy is going to be like Robert Downey Jr. in Less Than Zero with this.  They're going to turn him into a male prostitute.  Are you saying that Jimmy gives good head and is dead?  What's that, Jim?  No, it's just a sign from Less Than Zero.  Go ahead.  Yeah, it all starts off.  It definitely turned him into a male prostitute, like six months from now. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, it all starts.  It's definitely going to be like on another website.  Yeah.  It starts off nice.  It all starts off fine and dandy.  You think you're in control.  But eventually we're going to open up one of those doors and you're going to be on your  knees as Joseph for a minute.  Oh, come on.  Look, let me just put my tongue in the ass.  I don't care if you showered.  Just a second.  Nah, nah, you owe us.  That was one of the sickest scenes in Less Than Zero where Robert Downey Jr. is on his  knees.  I saw it recently, but it was on TV and they cut that part.  He became such a drug addict that he was blowing that guy to get some, well, so that's what 
[01:08:30]  happens.  Some crack.  Ah, whatever you got to do.  Yeah.  You got a little crack.  That's going to be like you, though.  Everything was nice, but now you're going to be banging on that door every day.  Come on, man.  I need it.  I need it.  I need it, man.  Come on.  Help me out.  Could you imagine being somebody that has your addiction and doesn't have an income?  What would you, what the hell would you do if you didn't have the money to spend?  You'd be rapping old ladies over the head with bricks.  Nah, you just go online and whack your back.  It's mostly...  No, that's what Newark is for. 
[01:09:00]  Five bucks.  That's what Newark is for.  Man, I will suck your dick.  Get off the highway in Newark someday.  Yeah, that city's really becoming a great metropolis.  And it will want a burger.  Holy ass.  That's what Newark is for.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Break yourself, nigga.  Break yourself.  Love that movie.  What is that?  Menace to Society.  Oh.  Yeah, that's a great one.  I'm just hanging up on people because it's easier, so don't get insulted. 
[01:09:30]  They're all like, whatever.  I'm sure they're going,  Huff!  Huff!  I was hung up on.  Huff!  I'm insulted.  Well, I...  Well, I never...  Rob, uh, Norn already said that she...  Indeed!  She...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  She didn't...  She...  Yeah.  That's a trooper.  And then you kissed.  And then we...  And then you cuddled.  Ah, and then we...  Kissing, cuddling. 
[01:10:00]  Was there any small talk going on?  Any, like, little small talk?  I just kept telling how beautiful she was.  It was a nice experience, so it wasn't really much small talk, and I guess she was fighting  revulsion.  She had her face in my neck.  It was nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right.  That's very good.  We'll get her review, hopefully, a little later when she wakes up.  Yeah, she can be honest, you know.  You know.  After she gets out of the shower that she's been taking for 24 hours with the money that  she got up in a display case, so there's a constant reminder that that's what she did  it for.  There was no money.  It was just a friendly exchange between two people.  Nothing, actually. 
[01:10:30]  After she gets hosed down.  Like seeing in Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, do they have a room to hose them down after they're done with that?  It's a mad house!  A mad house!  Jesus.  Big fire hose on her back.  Right.  Trying to wash the jimmy off of her.  Let's play 1964.  Hmm.  No?  Almost.  Oh, I'm still right.  Nothing.  I like it.  I didn't give a...  It was almost there.  That's all right.  We still did the incentives.  Set the dogs on him, too.  Okay.  No? 
[01:11:00]  Well, yeah, actually, there was something there.  A little some.  10202, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, you're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know that by now.  It says it right on your stupid XM unit there, right?  Do you know what I used to do to make my cat look?  I would do this on paper.  No one could hear you scratching the paper.  You're scratching the paper.  That was a horrendous visual.  Hold on.  This is what I would do to make my cat look.  I would go...  Ooh. 
[01:11:30]  On a piece of paper?  No, no, no.  It was my cock against his tongue.  Oh.  A little rough.  You gotta go...  You guys want to see a paper cut?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Stop it.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  Can you imagine doing that across the hole of your dick?  Well, you know what?  Why do you have to say...  Across your eyeball.  People who kill their wives on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Listen to this.  This is a segment called Heroes.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:12:00]  You want to do this Groton Man story real fast?  That's what we're getting into.  Oh, everyone can understand this.  Anyone who's been married.  And this guy was married for 29 years.  29 years.  The guy was 51 years...  Is 51 years old.  Married 29 years.  Do a little math, Opie.  29 years?  How old was he when he got married? 
[01:12:30]  How old is he now?  51.  Married 29 years.  He got married too young.  So, now, you're a 22-year-old guy, right?  You should not be getting married at 22 years old.  What?  23?  23.  I'm sorry.  From...  Look at us with our math skills.  Wait, how old is he?  Well, it's subtraction.  That is a tough one.  Wait, how old is he?  51.  And he got married at 22.  That's 29 years.  Why are you saying 23 years?  Yeah, why are you saying 24? 
[01:13:00]  I swear to God.  He jumps in with a correction and it's wrong.  My English stinks and your math stinks.  No, no, no.  I forgot to put it on the other side.  Oh, wow.  I practiced the puts all weekend long.  All right, sorry.  All right.  So, you know, you're 22 years, 21 years old.  How old?  22 years old.  And now from 22 to 51, you have this woman that is just telling you what to do all the  time.  Ragging you.  And he finally lost his mind.  A Groton man, Connecticut, charged with murder in the death of his wife, told police that 
[01:13:30]  he ran her over in their driveway because she berated and nagged him.  Berated and nagged him.  But that happens to a lot of couples.  It does.  It certainly does.  And this guy couldn't take it anymore.  His description is a classic of what happened. 
[01:14:00]  Blakeslee, 51, said that on September 10th, his wife, Christine, nagged him about a motor  vehicle ticket he'd received several weeks earlier.  Oh, okay.  I'm starting to feel this story.  He said his wife of 29 years would not drop the matter.  Oh, have you been in this, people?  How many times have I told you to slow down?  They're going to take it, but you won't slow down.  Yeah.  What happens?  When does it turn into this, by the way?  I don't know.  You always, like, I don't know, you start dating someone, it's all about sex, and you 
[01:14:30]  can't do no wrong, she can't do no wrong.  But slowly but surely, all, like, relationships creep into this type of a situation.  Hopi, this is after 29 years.  That's what I mean, but it slowly creeps.  You don't really notice it happening, you know?  I was in a relationship for a while.  I'm not going to mention any names.  I'm going to go get coffee.  Who, what, where, no names or anything.  But I got to tell you, being ragged on and bitched at is not a fun thing. 
[01:15:00]  Like not doing your vacuuming before I pick you up?  Right.  All that kind of fun stuff.  I used to, oh, wow.  I want, no, no, no.  Can I tell one story?  What?  I used to, Ed and I used to commute, because we lived in the same town when we first moved  back to New York.  Beautiful Huntington, New York.  Yeah, and I picked up Anthony, you know, and we'd take turns, like, commuting in and  taking turns driving and stuff.  I'll drive today.  And I would pick up Anthony around, I don't know, let's say about 10.  It was pretty accurate, right?  After rush hour, we decided to come in for our afternoon show, get some things done, maybe 
[01:15:30]  meetings or whatever.  Sure.  And I'm thinking, Anthony is not a morning person, so if I'm picking him up at 10, he  had to have gotten up maybe 9, 9, 15.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Absolutely.  And I would pick up Anthony, and this was more than once.  Like, Anthony would be at the front door, and his ex would be yelling and screaming at  him.  Yeah.  Yelling and screaming at him.  And I would get pissed off, and he would get in the car, and I'm like, what could you  have possibly done wrong?  I know you've only been up for 45 minutes, maybe an hour.  You know how much stuff you could do wrong in 45 minutes? 
[01:16:00]  Are you kidding?  Do you know the earth-shattering messes you can concoct in 45 minutes?  I remember one time it was because you didn't vacuum.  I used to smile when I walked out to get into that car to come to work.  Oh, would I smile.  I was done for the day.  And then...  Opie and his Funmobile, showing up at your house, like, whew!  Yeah, whew, here we go.  And then after the show, I would hang out and play video games until all hours of the 
[01:16:30]  night.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You know what?  I know.  Yeah, no, meeting.  I got to take a wait.  Yeah, another meeting.  Oh, this one's going on and on.  I don't know, you know, we got to meet with people again.  You know, we got in trouble, but I'll be home.  And I'll be home in, like, November.  Is that okay?  Why did I pick the month it is?  What an idiot.  What a fucking idiot.  And none of us noticed. 
[01:17:00]  Or this bit.  The day is September 19th.  Yeah.  But I remember one time you came into the car.  I'm like, what did you do wrong?  Well, I was supposed to vacuum before I left for work.  I think I was supposed to take out the garbage.  I think that was it.  I think that was my job.  All right.  Something like that.  But I won't mention any names of this relationship, but it was just a constant ragging.  And there were times where we would go out, and this girl would get a little intoxicated.  Hopi. 
[01:17:30]  A little drunk.  Sorry, I had something in my mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  And I would say, before we even went out, I would say, look.  I'm going to check my messages.  I think someone might have called while we were on break.  Please.  I'm begging you.  Even after you're drunk, try to keep this in your head.  Whatever you're going to start arguing about isn't important and does not need to be pursued.  Does not even need.  So, we're going out to have fun.  It's going to be fun. 
[01:18:00]  Let's go out.  We'll tip a few back, but keep it light and airy and fun.  Sure.  There's nothing to argue about.  And there's nothing to argue about right now, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, nothing important is going to happen while we're out drinking.  So, let's remember that and keep it.  Let's fast forward four hours.  I'll say four hours.  You mother fucker.  No, no.  Because you don't clean.  I do every fucking thing. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  And I'm like, remember the conversation?  Do you remember?  Just fuck yourself.  I'm going to be sitting over here for a while.  I'm in living hell.  This is unbelievable.  And, you know, occasionally you do get it in your mind.  If she was in front of my car, would I put it in drive, as this gentleman in this article did,  and maybe hit the gas?  Getting back to that story? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, that's where we were the whole time.  Oh, okay.  Well, can I ask a question?  Yes.  If you're dating someone and you feel that they're drinking too much,  wouldn't you say, like, maybe you shouldn't drink before we go out?  No.  No, no.  Can I say something else?  If she's not drinking, and I'm not drinking, and I had a drink.  Can I say something else?  Yeah.  She would call while we were on the air because it was happy hour time,  because we did three to seven.  And I remember phone calls where you would beg her not to get too drunk before you got there.  No shots.  No shots till I get there. 
[01:19:30]  And it's this big radio star, and he's begging this certain individual not to get too hammered before he got there.  I had to.  Well, Christine Blakeslee, 54, was bitching about the parking ticket he'd received several weeks earlier.  He said his wife of 29 years would not drop the matter, so he decided to get in his truck and leave.  That's a pretty rational thing for a guy to do, leave the situation.  Christine Blakeslee, the wife, followed him, climbed up on the running board. 
[01:20:00]  He drove the truck in reverse, causing his wife to fall.  Now, under normal circumstances, that would be a waker-upper right there.  You'd go, holy jeez, she just fell off the running board.  Things got out of hand.  Let me see if she's okay.  You know, she was ragging me and stuff.  Things got out of hand.  Now, this should pretty much take care of the problem.  He's quoted as saying, I stopped at the truck and looked out in front of me.  Picture this scene.  Blakeslee said in his statement, my wife was there in the headlights. 
[01:20:30]  She was kneeling with her hands in front of her.  Small pause.  I stepped on the gas.  How great is that?  I stepped on the gas. 
[01:21:00]  She never looked up.  I just wanted to make her stop.  I didn't think about the consequences.  He just wanted to make it stop.  That voice in his head.  Just make it stop.  That voice.  Parking ticket.  Back, back.  Stop, back.  I told you.  I told you so.  Just holding on to the running board.  Probably turned and looked at her face pressed against the window. 
[01:21:30]  What are you doing?  I told you.  Where are you going?  Get back here.  I stepped on the gas.  She never looked up.  I just wanted to make her stop.  I didn't think about the consequences.  I heard a thud.  Then I thought I heard her scream.  I didn't stop right away.  I stopped when it came to me that I hit her.  I kept thinking, oh my God.  I just killed my wife.  He said he returned to the house.  And what did he do afterwards, Opie? 
[01:22:00]  Did he call 911?  Did he check on her?  Did he freak out?  He went to sleep.  He finally got sleep.  It was finally quiet.  First night of peaceful sleep.  And I'll tell you another.  She's like just dead in the driveway.  She's dead in the driveway.  And he's like.  He's snoozing away.  Let me tell you another treat that some guys have to go through.  The I gotta go to sleep, but there's a fight going on. 
[01:22:30]  You're in bed.  You have to get up for work.  You're in bed.  Is this a real story?  Trying to sleep.  Or is this something that you've heard?  Let's just say I might be familiar with this certain situation.  All right, I'm going to go sit back over here for a while.  There's been a drunken argument.  You're trying to rationalize, but it's like rationalizing with a pumpkin or a porcupine or a cactus.  You know, try to rationalize with it.  It's not going to listen.  So you finally decide it's time for bed.  It's time for bed. 
[01:23:00]  You gotta sleep.  My God, you gotta sleep.  It's six in the morning.  And you're going to bed.  Climb into bed.  You're all aggravated, but maybe you could just relax long enough and go to sleep.  From downstairs.  Fucking idiot.  Son of a bitch.  Why the...  Son of a...  Fucking...  Crick.  God damn son of a bitch.  Never listen to a fucking...  Where'd I?  Dang it, son...  Motherfucker.  Now you're trying to sleep.  Holy gasp. 
[01:23:30]  Your chips are uncomfortable.  Now you're trying to sleep.  And this is all going on.  And you're trying.  I hate these stories.  And you think in your head, do I just lay here and hopefully fall asleep?  Or it's a fine line.  Do I wake up and continue this argument that now will put it into hyperdrive?  Can I throw something else into this, Mick?  Yes, yes.  When that's going on and you're upstairs, part of you's got to be thinking, she might stab me.  Yeah, there were some times you would actually think something might happen. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All kinds of thoughts go through your head.  But you know the best thing is to stay in bed and try to go to sleep.  Because you've tried them all before.  You tried all the...  You get up and continue trying to rationalize.  It just goes on and on.  It doesn't end.  And then, when you finally do sleep, and she sleeps and everyone wakes up, it never happened.  Hey, how you doing?  Morning.  Morning. 
[01:24:30]  Morning.  You're living with what's-her-name from misery.  And that...  Kathy Bates.  Yeah, Kathy Bates.  Hey.  A young version of Kathy Bates.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Oh, you.  And you're like, where's Soapy?  Beat the horn, Opie.  Please.  Honk, honk.  Oh, I gotta go.  Ah, it's time for work.  You know I was your savior, right?  Why are you leaving at 8 a.m.?  You haven't acknowledged lately that I was your savior.  What? 
[01:25:00]  You just haven't acknowledged it lately.  I want to hear it today.  I'd have probably left sooner if it wasn't for you and Sandy.  I was your savior.  I'm not going to say that.  You were my savior as far as work goes.  Get me this kick-ass job in radio.  But I brought fun back into your life.  I'm really assessing this.  Hold on.  You gave me the cool job in radio.  No, just the opportunity and you...  And the rest is history.  Having nothing to do with any relationships I've been in. 
[01:25:30]  I don't think that really fits, Opie.  I don't know because I don't think you would ever get divorced.  Are you insane?  Well, you talked about how you couldn't get divorced for a while there.  Why?  Wait, how many...  Didn't you want to get divorced way before you did?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  And I didn't because I had a kick-ass job in radio.  Hmm.  I don't get it.  Well, it was just kind of a good distraction.  Well, that's what I mean. 
[01:26:00]  I was your savior.  Or my curse.  If you think of it that way, I would have been out of it.  You think?  Perhaps earlier.  It was a good distraction.  I was having a good time away from the house.  Well, that's what I mean by the savior part.  I gave you a nice distraction.  Because...  Blood on your hands and on your feet, stigmata?  My savior?  Well, no.  This is what the point I'm getting at is that I think I know you well enough to know that  you realized early on that you weren't in the greatest relationship, right?  Yeah.  But you also had a shitty job.  So you had a shitty job. 
[01:26:30]  Then you had this going on at home.  Yeah.  But then you got into radio, so at least it gave you fun, fun, fun.  And a distraction.  I think I'd have walked away from the entire situation earlier.  The job, the woman, everything.  If I was still in that crappy job.  Okay.  I think it would have really...  Who knows?  So what happened to the Blake Slees?  By the way, can I say that Robert Blake's wife's last name was Blakely?  How coincidental is that?  None whatsoever.  Not funny or interesting either. 
[01:27:00]  As I said it, that's good job, flow stopper.  An autopsy report ruled Christine Blakeslee's death, ruled her death a homicide, saying  she died of blunt, forced chest trauma.  Oh, man.  Oh, hit her right in the chest with a bumper.  Not only did he hit her, he hit her.  He's like, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to make it look good.  He went to the house, went to sleep, told police he woke up, checked the driveway, saw  his wife was still there, and called 911.  I didn't want to face what happened, he said.  I was hoping it was all a bad dream.  Yeah, a 29-year bad dream. 
[01:27:30]  She jumped on the running board.  She's bitching about a ticket.  You fucking bitch.  And he realized he'd killed his wife, he tried to commit suicide by drinking and taking Tylenol.  What's that going to do?  In his second version, he told police he woke up early in the morning, heard a car breaking,  then a thud, looked out a window, and saw a light-colored car driving away. 
[01:28:00]  Blakeslee told police he returned to bed and noticed that his wife was gone, said he found  her dead in the driveway.  How are you going to say that when there's a dent in your car because you hit your wife?  Her hair is in your bumper.  What a foolish thing.  At least say you saw a light-colored car with a black guy in it driving away.  Oh, it wasn't in Boston.  Okay.  It was in Connecticut.  I am sorry.  I didn't want to kill her.  I just wanted her to stop.  That's what it says.  Ladies, do some thinking. 
[01:28:30]  Are you an egg?  Are you ragging your husband?  Are you constantly just pecking away at his head?  But in the beginning, it's just not like that.  But something happens slowly but surely, and then you wake up one day and realize, oh my  God, I'm in a nightmare.  Opie, sometimes you can find the right person you get along with, you can chat with, and  it's wonderful.  But when you're in a situation, you're in a relationship like that, you've got to get 
[01:29:00]  out.  You've got to run because it's going to end up, she will either kill you through the nagging  or you will see her in the headlights, on her knees, hands in front of her, and you know  what choice he'll make?  The little skinny pedal on the right.  We haven't played this in a couple days.  We're not going to break, though.  I just want to play this really fast.  Oh, I love this.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  Oh, I'm going to get a little coffee. 
[01:29:30]  How do you like this?  Oh, that's great.  You wouldn't get away with it here.  But you should.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  She spilled my coffee.  The little laugh is the greatest.  The little chuckle, because he knows what's coming.  He's laughing because he's the only one that knows what's coming.  I'm sorry, sir.  That coffee-spilling bitch has no clue she's getting that in the face.  Her just desserts.  Janine, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Let's go. 
[01:30:00]  Let's go.  I just want to say that you guys are making me want to leave my husband out of an act of  mercy.  Why?  Do you rag him?  I hate me right now.  Are you a rag, a nag?  I don't want to be.  I don't want to be.  I don't think I have a choice, though.  It's in our nature.  Why?  Why don't you have a choice?  Because he's a guy, and he does stupid guy things, and I just can't let go.  Sometimes those stupid guy things we do at the beginning of the relationship were called  cute.  Yeah, they were called cute, and I used to want to keep him in my closet and take him out 
[01:30:30]  and look at him because he was so funny, and now I just want to lock him in there.  And I'm sure he wants to kill me half the time.  And the things you guys rag about, they used to not be that big an issue.  And then slowly they become this big issue that needs to be addressed on a minutely basis.  Your clothes are on the floor.  I suck.  They totally suck.  And on Halloween, I was jumping up and down yelling because he refused to put on his mask. 
[01:31:00]  I'm a dick.  See, those are things.  If you don't want to put on a mask, he don't put on a mask.  You know what?  I used to get ragged at all the time at weddings.  Come on.  Let's dance.  Let's get up and dance.  And I'm like, I don't want to dance.  I want to sit here.  I want to finish my drink.  And I just want to sit here and watch everyone else dance because they look like drunken buffoons.  Get up and dance.  Why don't you ever dance?  And then the arm pull where you've got to hold on to your seat.  Now it's assault. 
[01:31:30]  I don't want to dance.  And it's just ragged.  Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I'm kidding.  I'm going to come off.  I'm sorry.  I hate these flashbacks.  I just hate.  This is the only time.  Poor guy doesn't want to put his mask on and you're yelling at him.  Yelling at him.  What kind of mask was it?  What kind of mask?  It was a stupid burglar mask.  It was the only thing I could get him to wear because it was cheap and easy.  But he's a musician and I try to do everything for him.  So then when it's my time, I have to insist that it goes my way. 
[01:32:00]  And I'm just an asshole.  What kind of burglar mask?  Like one around the eyes or one around the mouth?  Like a hamburglar?  I think every marriage should end after seven years.  Think seven years?  Seven years.  That's it.  I think there should be an option.  Like you go a few years and you have an option to re-up your marriage license.  You've got to get it.  You know, it could expire.  You laugh, but it's not a bad idea.  If both parties are in agreeance, you re-up your marriage license for another couple of years.  Instead of like signing that marriage certificate and now you're stuck for life because all the women get all the money and stuff when you do finally divorce. 
[01:32:30]  You can't get a lifetime fishing license.  Right.  And that's for a fish.  Right.  But you could get a wife and it's a lifetime license that never expires.  Well, I just...  Who stays in one job for 40 years?  No one.  Exactly.  Why do you have to stay with the same person for 40 years?  You do.  Because you said...  Marriage in this day and age just doesn't make sense anymore.  No.  It just doesn't.  I wouldn't put the mask on.  Thanks to you guys, I'm going to drive away and I'm never going to look back and he'll hear it on the replay. 
[01:33:00]  And honey, I'm sorry I'm doing this because I love you.  Do you like sucking God?  I'm going.  Leave him alone.  Yeah, leave him alone, man.  Or be a friend.  Be a chick that's interesting.  Do something like cup of fart and throw it in his face.  He'll love you for that.  Do something silly.  Here you go.  I'll learn to gag more.  Nice.  Yeah, that's nice.  We like when you gag just a little bit.  You should have said, put the mask on, honey.  Hobble on.  Yeah.  I told you the girl that would put the bucket by the side of my...  Yes.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  Thank you, Janine.  I use ice cream and learn to gag.  Thank you.  Oh, you remember the ice cream?  Good memory.  I like Anthony's...  I like your suggestion there, man.  Yeah.  Have a whole license, a renewal thing.  Have a marriage license with an expiration on it.  It's not a bad idea.  Let's say hi to Keith in Cincinnati.  How about those Bengals, Keith, huh?  That looked good yesterday, guys.  Very good.  They kicked the Cowboys' ass 26 to 3.  Well, maybe if we didn't have a 50-year-old quarterback, that wouldn't happen.  Well, you guys got rid of the Coke guy.  I didn't.  Parcells did a dope...  What was his name again?  Quincy Carter. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, Quincy.  Vinny with three interceptions.  Vinny stinks.  Dude, we knew Vinny was awful when he was with the Jets.  That's how you build an offense.  Take someone from the Jets.  What's the matter?  Wasn't Daryl Stingley available?  Wow.  Wow.  But he's in a wheelchair, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yeah, I was calling just to relate.  You're talking about nagging women.  I'm getting ready to go through a divorce myself, and I was married to the naggingest  bitch on the face of the earth.  Yeah, but it didn't... 
[01:34:30]  Hold on.  But it didn't start like that, right?  I'm sorry?  It didn't start like that, right?  I still didn't pick that up.  Your line is really distorting on my end.  Your relationship didn't start like that with her nagging.  Oh, hell no.  No.  Maybe this guy needs to be nagged, too.  You just had to tell him three fucking times.  He doesn't listen.  It's a right pedal versus a middle pedal.  Trust me, I can relate to it, but I would never take it that far.  So when did you realize that the nagging was definitely a problem? 
[01:35:00]  Because I bet you at first there's a little nag that comes your way, but you're like, eh,  whatever.  Yeah, all right.  Maybe she could take it.  Maybe she just had a bad day where I could take it.  What?  I thought it was hormone swings from the pregnancy.  She got pregnant early on.  I thought it was just that.  After she had the baby, she stayed a bitch, so it wasn't that.  Yeah.  That's...  Ugh.  You should be able to get out of this stuff without a lawyer getting involved, man.  Now she's a mom with her stupid socks pulled up over the stretchy pants.  Last week, and you had me dead to death with that little story about getting raped, you  know, a $60,000 a year, taking half of it. 
[01:35:30]  You know, you got me worried the best now.  Thanks.  I appreciate that, guys.  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right, Keith.  Good luck to you there, huh?  Thank you.  Have a good one.  I don't know where this guy's going, but we'll see.  Bill in Boston, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How about those socks?  How about the Pats?  You got to congratulate him on the Pats.  I already did the Pats tour.  Yeah, I got to do it again.  I got to do it again.  Pats beat the Rams 40 to 22.  Who cares?  Go ahead.  Ah, Ann, I don't know if you can, like, how much can you talk about your divorce?  Like, was there any agreement in the settlement or anything like that? 
[01:36:00]  I'm just talking about general relationships, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Anthony speaks freely.  That's it.  Well, I wanted to ask you, like, out of all the lawyers in New York, why would she hire  Dominic Barbara, who's associated with Howard?  Yeah, and then the company doesn't understand why we hate Howard and we should get along with  him.  Yeah, okay.  No shit.  I would guess, you know, I don't know why, but I would guess because it's, you know, one  of those great little tactics.  It just, it puts the fear of things being in the public eye on someone else's radio show. 
[01:36:30]  It, you know, he's known for being a pretty good divorce lawyer, too.  Right.  So, all right.  There you go.  Well, that's that.  There it is.  Huh?  There it is.  What?  There it is.  There it is.  Okay.  We got Tony Dan's outtakes.  Outtakes?  Outtakes.  You mean applause breaks?  No, these are outtakes.  Outtakes from?  From doing promos for his show.  How do we get these?  We don't want to tell anyone how we get these. 
[01:37:00]  We are entrenched.  We're well connected in this city.  That's great.  We got outtakes of Tony Dan's are trying to do some promos.  Right, Steve?  We're going to take a break first.  Nice.  Don't say where you got it from because this guy could be a gold mine for us.  What is that hat you're wearing?  What's on the side of that one?  It's flames.  Something with a flame on it.  And a skull on one side.  Exactly.  Flames and skull.  That's why you were able to wear the shirt with nothing on it.  Exactly.  I had to compensate.  Yeah.  I had to compensate with the hat.  I like it.  You think about what you're going to wear every day. 
[01:37:30]  Well, to the extent that it's...  Because you fold up your sleeves perfectly.  Yeah.  Just like two and a half times on each side.  I get the most disgusted look from Norton right now.  It's just the hat.  Oh, okay.  No, I can't say where we got it, but...  I can't even listen to you talk anymore because of Norton.  Why?  Yes?  Go ahead.  Can't say where we got it?  What exactly is the audio?  Oh, the audio.  It's Outtakes.  Is he playing it? 
[01:38:00]  Pardon me.  Martini Steve.  There's Martini Steve.  Oh, it is.  So we got this audio from what?  A very nice person.  All right.  Cool.  You came in for that?  I was told to come into the studio.  I don't really know what the hell I was talking about.  I can't hear you guys in the other room, by the way.  So I'm yelled at to get into the studio.  What are you working on today for the show?  What I handed you and then some more audio of a pre-interview from that show.  Is that good?  I don't know yet.  It's dumping into Pro Tools right now. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  I'm learning this whole thing.  Are you letting your hair grow back or are you going to keep it short?  I'm going to let it grow back.  It's cool short.  Thank you, sir.  I like it.  Thank you.  Yeah, I like it.  It's growing in.  And it's growing in at the same rate as his sideburns.  Exactly.  Uniformity.  Pork chop sideburns.  Dude, you were that kid in school, man.  You grow that crap in a day.  Yeah, I was at 12.  I had sideburns.  He was a 5 o'clock shadow guy.  He's Lebanese.  We all had one of those guys in school growing up.  My buddy Joe Curry was foot, plank foot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He was that guy.  He actually got thrown out of the school one day and he was going to the school. 
[01:39:00]  They were convinced he wasn't a student.  And he was telling them, no, I go here.  And they just kept ushering him out the door because he had a full beard.  I mean, like, ridiculous, full, grisly Adam's beard.  And what was he, like, 15 years old?  He was, no, it was his senior year.  So he was, you know, 17, 18.  The type of guy that gets served when he's, like, 16, right?  Oh, yeah.  He was buying beers for us.  You know, he was the great guy to have around because he could go in and buy beers.  They wouldn't proof him.  All right.  Mark wants in.  Go ahead, Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:39:30]  Hey.  I just signed my divorce papers two weeks ago.  Congratulations.  Bro.  You know what I'm saying?  I would bust my ass, take clients out after work.  I'd get home at 3 in the morning, have to be back in my office at 6.30.  So enough time for a half-hour nap and a shower.  Right.  And she would bitch and bitch.  Meanwhile, all day, she was sitting at Americana Shopping Center spending the money I fucking  made on a little prod of shoes.  There you go.  So you know what?  They nag and they nag.  Yep.  And you know what?  I can understand why somebody wants to run their wife over. 
[01:40:00]  You know, for that little minute where she's just glimmering in the headlights, for that  split second where any rational thinking human being would say, no.  And you put it in park and go, what am I thinking?  But there's that one little moment.  Well, you want to tell them, put your head by the hood.  See if you hear that noise.  Could you listen?  I hear a clicking.  Right, right.  What is that?  Bam.  That's it.  It's over.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  The show is great.  Poor bastard.  The marriage was going well, but I was drinking consistently on the road. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Jim's smart, though.  He knows he can't hear it.  Oh, very good.  All right.  Mr. Smarty Pants.  One more.  We've got to go to Phoenix.  Say hi to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  By the way, as I'm putting income in the bank,  week after week,  I was told,  I was told I couldn't get a cell phone.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do, Anthony.  I want a cell phone.  Just like you.  You don't need a cell phone.  Just like your pal Opie. 
[01:41:00]  I think I was a bad influence on you.  You don't need a cell phone.  All of us was a cell phone.  I remember you guys got an argument.  You don't need a cell phone.  You want a cell phone.  What if there's an emergency?  Well, you know,  you can get a car phone,  like a big unit that goes in the car,  but no cell phone.  Son of a bitch.  And then you've got to weigh.  You've got to weigh it.  Do I be a man and get the cell phone  and say go fuck yourself,  or do I not have to deal with an argument now  because of this?  What was the problem with the cell phone? 
[01:41:30]  There has to be a reason.  What?  There has to be some rational reason?  Wait a minute, Opie.  Have you been listening?  There has to be a reason for some of this stuff?  I thought there might have been a reason  that was told to you.  A reason?  Yeah.  Like a legitimate argument,  a legitimate other side,  other view,  that would then be focused back to me,  that I would then...  People thought we were rock stars,  and you're having these arguments behind the scenes  over our cell phone.  Wow.  The only rocking I was doing  was in my own feces 
[01:42:00]  as I was trying to figure out  how I would get out of this.  Please.  There was nothing going on.  And you did quite well for yourself,  my friend.  You know something?  Like the sad clown,  I was able to come in on a daily basis  and make people laugh  though I cried inside.  Oh, they laughed and they laughed  and they laughed.  Though I cried inside.  Oh, my God.  John the trucker,  we've got to take a break,  but John, go ahead.  Is my mic on?  Should be.  I was just going to make a suggestion.  Can you hear me, fella? 
[01:42:30]  I can get the second mic from that.  Holy shit, is this today's problem?  John, can you hear Norton?  Yeah.  John, if I ask you a question right now,  you can hear me.  I can hear you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, then it was that guy's problem.  No problemo.  All right, go ahead, John.  I'm just going to tell you  how to keep the second wife from nagging.  You shoot and kill the first one.  I like it.  Yeah, a little warning.  He's not kidding.  Why would you even have a second wife?  I could not imagine  getting married the second time.  Just don't happen.  I met her when I was in prison. 
[01:43:00]  You met your second wife  while you were in prison?  Yeah.  For killing your first wife?  Right.  You really killed your first wife?  I shot her,  got the bitch right through  the fucking head.  All right, hold on.  We're not taking a break  any time soon.  Now, I...  Dude, he's a trucker.  You've got to believe him.  Now, what were these circumstances?  And how did you get out of jail?  I was 15 to life.  I got out in 15 years.  I thought this guy  was just a little cute little joke. 
[01:43:30]  How do you keep your second wife  from nagging you?  You killed the first one.  You killed the first one.  Ha, ha, ha.  Little joke.  Thank you.  And then,  you're listening to  the O.P. and Anthony show.  Dude, you've got to tell us  what happened.  Give me the story  of what happened  leading up to  and after killing your wife.  Yeah, let's back up here.  What led up to it?  What did she do  to deserve this?  Well, we were both  doing acid.  We was all fucked up.  Oh, my God.  We're talking to Charlie Manson.  Captain Agamine.  Captain Agamine.  I come on board one day. 
[01:44:00]  I was all fucked up on acid.  She started in.  I just blowed her fucking head off.  She was ragging.  Do you remember?  Hey, John,  do you remember  what she was nagging you about?  Oh, she was nagging  about my coming in late  and shit.  I got off work  at four in the afternoon.  I wanted to get home  until like 11,  12 o'clock at night.  What were you doing?  You never spend no time with me.  You never do this.  You never do that.  See, look at what it got her.  Bitch, you never spend time with me.  How old a guy are you, John? 
[01:44:30]  Do what?  How old are you?  Right now, I'm 49.  49.  49.  Okay, so you decided  to kill her.  So what did you do?  You grabbed your shotgun.  Come on.  No, I always carried the pistol.  I mean, I lived back in Kansas  back there.  So you always had a pistol on you  and you just leveled it at her  and shot her in the head?  Shot her right between the fucking eyes.  Was she surprised?  A little bit. 
[01:45:00]  Did she look?  I don't know if she was so surprised  or she just amazed I'd do it.  What size gun was it, sir?  22.  Oh, wow.  That gives them a little time  to think about it.  Oh, jeez.  Was she alive after you shot her?  No, 22 does better, really,  than it is a head wound.  You think so?  She's around.  Kind of bounces around  in the brain pan a little bit?  So then...  Yeah, kind of scrambles it  rather than  burn the hole completely through it.  So then she...  Did she live through  the initial blast?  No.  She was dead.  She dropped dead  right there on the spot. 
[01:45:30]  I sat down,  spoke to the joint,  called the cops,  told them I killed her.  They come out,  picked my ass up.  Stand somebody.  I think I killed Doyle.  Eating potatoes.  That's why that buddy  might say,  he goes,  that sounds like  something out of that  fucking sling blade.  Poor little feller.  All right,  so then they arrested you  and you were convicted?  I just killed Doyle.  And you only got 15 to life?  15 to life out of it.  And how many years 
[01:46:00]  did you serve?  I'm sorry,  you both talked  at the same time.  Sorry,  how much time  did you serve?  15 years.  15 years.  Sir,  I have to ask you  the question now.  You're out,  you're a trucker.  Was it worth it?  Yeah,  because I didn't  pay no fucking support.  It was worth it.  He spent 15 years  in prison  for killing his wife 
[01:46:30]  and he says  it was worth it.  How did you  break that news  to your second wife?  She knew about it.  I just told her  to read this  newspaper article,  told her the dates,  stuff she folded up  and looked at it.  All right,  I got to tell you  what's going on  in the studio.  Jim was not buying  this story  when we started,  right?  Not at all.  I want to put this guy  in hold.  I want to get his last name.  I want to see  if we can find  an article on this.  Oh, yeah,  your name would pop up  in the news,  right?  It should.  It was a long time ago,  but it should. 
[01:47:00]  All right,  you know what?  Can you hold on  through the break?  Yeah.  All right,  hold on.  All right,  we got to see  if this is real.  John the trucker  killed his wife.  Wait,  we could ask him  one other thing.  Give me John  for a second.  And then he did  15 years to life.  So, John,  your second wife  started writing you  in prison?  Yeah,  she started writing me  when I put my name  in Easy Rider magazine,  you know,  that mail call.  Right. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, my God.  All right,  we'll get the second  part of your story next.  So he had his name  in Easy Rider.  Easy Rider.  And she started writing  him in prison  and then he gets out  15 years later  and they get married.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right,  obviously,  you'll stick around  because we've got to  get the second part  of this story  in just a minute here.  M202,  the OPN Anthony Show.  Ah,  good old Mr. B retires.  Tom Brokaw  retired from  every scene.  He was the anchorman  and he finally retired. 
[01:48:00]  What do you think  he's doing in retirement now  as we look back here?  I'm relaxing.  Taking it easy.  It's got to suck.  Tom Brokaw,  you reported all  the heavy,  heavy news  that hit us  in this generation  and now,  what do you think  he's doing?  Seriously,  did he take up  badminton or something?  He would love to have  talked about  the bombings  and the lesson,  but nothing.  He had to sit there  and watch it on television.  I bet he pontificates  around his friends  and annoys them  like something happened  and he goes,  well,  you know what I think,  no,  and nor do we care. 
[01:48:30]  No one cares,  Tom.  This is what I think  of Tom Brokaw.  Oh,  no.  What do you think?  You had nothing.  Fucking girl farts.  Nothing came out.  What was that?  I had something,  but I figured  if I pushed a little harder,  oh,  it was going to all come out.  I think Tom Brokaw's  a turtle.  If I pushed any harder,  I would have been playing  bingo in my underpants.  This is what I think  of Tom Brokaw.  I'm shitting myself.  That's right.  That's right.  Tom Brokaw looks like  rice pudding. 
[01:49:00]  Tom Brokaw retires.  We discuss it.  Check it out.  Laser sounds right here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Well,  last night was a very sad day,  Anthony.  Oh,  sad?  Very sad day in broadcasting.  Yes.  It was Tom Brokaw's last night.  Yeah.  Doing NBC nightly news.  You got to give it to the guy.  Pretty dignified.  I think he,  I liked him the best  out of the three.  No real scandals.  Peter Jennings.  Involving him. 
[01:49:30]  Peter Jennings is good.  Smooth.  Super liberal douche.  Huh?  Peter Jennings is a liberal douche.  He's a Canadian.  Yeah,  of course.  Well,  I,  you know,  there's Tom right now  as we talk about him.  Doing his last broadcast.  Saying goodnight  for the last time.  So,  he did his last broadcast  last night.  Getting a little,  hooking up a little  serious.  It was pretty much  Tom Brokaw day  all day long  on NBC yesterday. 
[01:50:00]  On NBC.  Isn't that funny  when they do,  when that happens,  the other stations  just don't even hit on it.  But it's the hugest news  ever on Channel 4  and NBC stations.  Oh,  they go in for the close-up  to see his teary eyes.  Yeah.  I should watch his mouth  just acrobatics  trying to wrap his lips  around the words.  So,  there was an uncomfortable  moment on the Today Show  yesterday morning.  Oh,  they figured they would  break out the champagne  and the Today Show,  Tom started on the Today Show  years ago.  He was on there. 
[01:50:30]  And they figured  they would,  give him a little toast,  a little send-off.  Mm-hmm.  And the guy starts like,  getting all choked up.  Yeah,  you don't want to see that.  It's like watching your dad  get all choked up.  Thank God  we'll never get to that point.  Huh?  We'll never get to that point  where we know  it's our last broadcast.  No,  no,  we get thrown off.  Yeah,  you know,  we'll go out in a blaze of glory,  thank God,  because I don't want to be like  old and have to look at Anthony  for the last time  and go,  this is the last time 
[01:51:00]  I'm going to see you.  This is the last show.  Right.  I remember when we started.  Whip him out Wednesday.  It's safe to say  that'll never happen.  Nah.  We will blow this up again  and that'll be it.  That's the way to go out.  We get fired in our prime.  You don't want anyone  telling you it's over.  You just want to blow it up yourself.  Have to look at Slappy and Wappy  waiting to take your seat  the next day.  Yeah.  Young go-getters. 
[01:51:30]  Hey,  O&A,  big fans,  grew up listening to you guys.  It's going to be so exciting  to take your places.  That's very good.  Let me give you boys  some advice.  Yeah,  yeah,  great,  great,  great.  Okay,  goodbye,  goodbye,  goodbye,  goodbye.  Right,  right,  right.  Could you just,  you know,  get your seat out of here,  it smells like hemorrhoid cream.  Oh,  you got to be that guy.  It's like that movie  with Jack Nicklaus,  Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson,  sorry.  No,  I just watched it last night  about Schmidt.  Holy S.  Dude,  that movie's so depressing  I know 
[01:52:00]  that I laugh really hard.  It's horrible.  I look at that as a comedy.  It's a horrible movie.  It's hilarious.  He's retiring  and his life is just like a waste  and he's retiring  and they throw him  the retirement dinner  and they give him  a stupid watch  and the new guy,  that's what it reminds me of.  The young go-getter.  The young go-getter's  waiting to take over for him  and he was,  you know,  he was the center of attention  as a retirement party  and everything's great  and then remember  when he has nothing to do  and he goes back 
[01:52:30]  to the office  and he's trying to teach  the go-getter how it's done  and give him some advice  and just like you said,  the go-getter's like,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  whatever,  whatever,  whatever.  And then he leaves the office  and he sees all the files  that he collected  for like 20,  30 years in the dumpster.  Yep.  Dude,  I laughed so freaking hard at that.  During the dumpster,  I don't remember that part.  Oh,  he walks past the,  you know,  he leaves the office  after trying to give this new kid  some advice,  how the job's done and stuff  because he has all this  expertise and knowledge  that he built up  over the years  and the kid can't be bothered 
[01:53:00]  because I forget why.  I think he's got,  you know,  a lunch appointment  or he's just distracted,  right?  So then Jack finally  leaves the office  and he sees the dumpster  with his old files.  His whole body of work,  everything he lived  and worked for  for years and years and years  amounted to garbage  and he is being replaced  and,  you know,  they got their ways  and they don't even need  his files.  Like,  I'm sure he assumed  if they came upon a problem  they could look in his files  and reference what he did  and stuff  and it just meant nothing. 
[01:53:30]  It meant nothing.  It was,  I laughed so hard  at that movie.  Dude,  when he comes home,  and the vacuum  sound is going.  Exactly.  And his wife is laying.  Can I explain why  that movie is really funny?  Funny?  Yeah,  because they're pulling  at your heartstrings,  okay?  I got that early on  that this is going to be  a brutal movie  about everything going wrong  with an older guy  with his life,  right?  But they pushed it  to the limit  that I couldn't be sad anymore.  I just started laughing  because you just knew  what was coming. 
[01:54:00]  You're like,  oh,  it's going to get worse  than this.  Then he comes home  and the vacuum cleaner's running  and his wife's dead.  His wife's dead on the floor  with her shoe off.  She's laying there  on her stomach.  The vacuum she was using  is still running,  so it's just,  you hear the vacuum going  and her feet are all askew  and one shoe is hanging off.  Yeah.  Right where she just dropped dead.  That's exactly the way  you'd find somebody dead.  I love that scene  with the vacuum going.  It's just awful.  So I was with the movie  and what they were trying  to bring across,  but then it got so ridiculous 
[01:54:30]  I took it the other way.  I'm like,  now this is really funny.  Yeah.  When he takes the mobile home  across the country  to see his daughter  who could care less about him.  I know, yeah.  And all of a sudden  he's pulling up  to his childhood home.  I already knew  that that was just  going to be something else.  He had a little smile  on his face.  He was so excited  to go back to his childhood home  that was there,  you know, 60 years ago.  Right.  And I already knew  that it was just going to be  just brutal.  I started laughing.  I actually got yelled at.  There was a bunch of ladies 
[01:55:00]  watching the film behind me  and they started yelling at me  like,  that's not funny.  And it turns out to be  a, what, a tire store?  A tire store.  His old childhood home.  His old house  where he had all these memories.  And it wasn't,  there wasn't even a hint  that a house had been there.  It's like a tire store  and a big parking lot around it.  Wasn't he in the middle  of the tire store going,  this is about where my bedroom was  or something like that?  He goes,  I grew up here.  Right.  And the guy goes,  yeah, whatever,  a tire store?  Do you want some radios?  And he's like,  yep.  You can care less.  Yeah, no one cared about him  at all.  You know, 
[01:55:30]  that's one of those movies,  it wasn't supposed to be a comedy,  but they took it so far  that I couldn't help but laugh.  Couldn't help but laugh.  That horrific scene  that got all the publicity  was, what's her face?  Kathy Bates.  Kathy Bates.  Kathy Bates.  Getting into the hot tub.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a world of hurt.  Yeah, that was a little rough.  I think she's showing up tomorrow  for a cherry darts.  I think Steve booked that.  Did you like that movie though?  No, it was one of those movies  that was just kind of on.  And then?  I was looking over my shoulder  as I was playing EverQuest 2 
[01:56:00]  and kind of paying attention to it.  It just ends kind of.  Yeah, I go to movies  like Tuesday afternoons  with the old ladies.  That's what they do,  I guess, on Tuesdays.  And I was leaving the movie theater  just going, man,  that was a great comedy.  I swear to God.  It was a very depressing movie.  It was depressing.  Well, I explained it.  So then, walking out  and the old ladies  are just pissed off.  They're like,  I thought that was supposed  to be a comedy.  And I'm saying to myself,  it was for me.  They thought it was supposed  to be a comedy?  Yeah, because I guess 
[01:56:30]  the coming attractions  for that movie,  they showed all the kind  of funny moments.  Oh, ha ha.  No, there were funny moments  in the movie  and they strung those together  and we were talking  about this yesterday.  They market movies  in a weird way  and so they market  that movie  like it was kind  of a dark comedy.  Yeah.  And it certainly wasn't.  Well, I got it confused.  Funny you say that.  I got the movie confused  with that other movie  that came out  with Jack Nicholson.  Jack Nicholson.  Dude, I've been making  that mistake my whole life.  And every time  I'm thinking of 
[01:57:00]  the actor or the golfer,  I have to like  consciously think of his name.  What was the comedy  he was just in?  Don't tell me  that awful one  with him and the girl.  That wasn't that bad.  They really scream  at each other.  They both see each other naked.  With Kay Corleone.  Not as good as it gets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With Diane Keaton.  Diane Keaton.  That wasn't that bad.  I didn't see it  but I thought,  now last night  I thought that's what was on.  I thought that was the movie.  Oh, okay.  So as I'm watching it  I'm waiting for the funny 
[01:57:30]  and you know,  there he is retiring  and his life is in the garbage  and his wife is dead  on the floor.  I'm like, wait,  is this the movie  with Diane Keaton?  What's the name of that movie?  As good as it gets?  No, no, no.  That's the Oscar winner.  Something's Gotta Give.  Thank you.  Something's Gotta Give.  Yeah, Something's Gotta Give.  Like that would happen  in real life.  He'd blow off  the hot piece of ass  for the old hag.  I mean, no offense  to the older ladies out there.  That ain't happening ever.  It ain't gonna happen.  Some.  Hi, Steve.  What were we talking about?  Oh, so Tom Brokaw. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yes.  His little send-off  on the Today Show  and he got a little choked up  and it was kind of  hard to watch.  You got a little clip?  Yeah, no,  I was being handed a note.  Yeah, so he was on  the Today Show  with everybody around him  giving him a send-off  before his last broadcast,  by the way.  We'll leave you now  with Tom Brokaw's goodbye.  He stopped by  the Today Show this morning  and Katie, Matt,  and the gang  toasted Tom.  Very special.  It's from a song, 
[01:58:30]  but nobody does it better  and no one ever has, Tom.  Well, it's very sweet.  It's been a great, great  privilege.  Thank you.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Congratulations  and all the best.  That's just awful.  Who wants to see that?  He really cried.  I thought he just  stopped himself.  Oh, no,  he couldn't even talk.  He was so choked up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:59:00]  Cheers.  Cheers.  Drink up, everybody.  I'm fucking cocked.  I get a little emotional.  I love champagne.  The bubbles tickle my nose.  Guys, can I have  one more week, please?  I don't want to go.  Oh, it's like Jack Nicholson.  I mean, Nicholas. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, in that movie.  It's like seeing your dad cry.  You don't want to see  your dad cry ever.  You never want to see that.  Oh, you never want to see that.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly.  So then.  No.  So then we got his final words  on.  Yes, here it is.  This is NBC Nightly News.  This is last.  This was his send-off.  Yes.  Last night.  Well, the time is here. 
[02:00:00]  We've been through a lot together  through dark days and nights  and seasons of hope and joy.  Yeah.  What other story?  I had only one objective  to get it right.  When I failed,  it was personally painful  and there was no greater urgency  than course correction.  On those occasions,  I was grateful for your forbearance  and always mindful  that your patience and attention  didn't come with a lifetime warranty.  I was not alone here, of course.  I am simply the most conspicuous part  of a large, thoroughly dedicated 
[02:00:30]  and professional staff  that extends from just beyond these cameras  across the country  and around the world  in too many instances  in places of grave danger  and personal hardship  and their family to me.  What have I learned here?  More than we have time  to recount this evening,  but the enduring lessons  through the decades  are these.  It's not the questions  that get us in trouble.  It's the answers.  And just as important,  no one person  has all the answers. 
[02:01:00]  Just ask a member  of the generation  that I came to know well,  the men and women  who came of age  in the Great Depression  who had great personal sacrifice,  saved the world  in World War II  and returned home  to dedicate their lives  to improving the nation  they had already served so nobly.  They weren't perfect.  No generation is.  But this one left  a large and vital legacy  of common effort  to find common ground  here and abroad  in which to solve  our most vexing problems.  They did not give up  their personal beliefs  and greatest passions,  but they never stopped 
[02:01:30]  learning from each other.  And most of all,  they did not give up  on the idea  that we're all  in this together.  We still are.  And it is in that spirit  that I say thanks  for all that I have learned  from you.  That's been my richest reward.  That's Nightly News  for this Wednesday night.  I'm Tom Brokaw.  You'll see Brian Williams  here tomorrow night,  and I'll see you  along the way.  So thanks for the...  Tom, thanks.  That was great.  No, I really wanted...  Come on, Tom.  You've got to get it. 
[02:02:00]  Take his mic off.  I'm not giving up my...  Take his mic off.  Come out of the seat.  We've got to get him out of here.  Come on.  Turn the music off.  I'm just saying.  And we thank you.  Come on, Brian Williams.  We're in the way.  You've got to go, Tom.  I don't want to go.  Go get your mobile home.  Go get your mobile home.  Go get your mobile home.  Go get your mobile home.  Give me another week.  Look, I'm not retired.  Go.  I don't want to retire anymore.  I don't want to retire anymore.  Please can I stay just a little while.  I want to stay.  I want to stay. 
[02:02:30]  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Take a motor home and see my daughter?  Have my Hummels fall off the roof as I drive away with the candles sliding?  Find my wife, Jen, with a vacuum cleaner going in her shoe slightly askew.  What a horrible day that will be.  I just want to stay here on NBC Nightly and lose.  Come on.  Who wants me to stay?  Raise your hand.  Come on.  Put your hands up, guys.  Look at the TV. 
[02:03:00]  They already got the new commercials for Brian Williams.  You're yesterday's news.  Yesterday, you're drinking champagne.  Today, they got the new commercials on TV.  Ain't life a bitch.  I walked out back yesterday, and I saw my segment I did on the Berlin Wall coming down in the dumpster.  It was horrible.  All my work, all the work I put into it, my touching tribute to the brave souls that lost their lives on the Challenger. 
[02:03:30]  It was sitting there on banana peels and garbage juice.  I pulled Brian Williams aside and told him, there's no greater thing than to be a communicator to the...  And he was like, yeah, whatever.  Whatever, Tom.  My seat now.  I was there packing.  I was there getting my mic turned off by opening.  No, I didn't do that one.  But it is time for you to go, so maybe that made sense there. 
[02:04:00]  Please, just a little bit longer.  Oh, please stay, Tom Brokaw, just a little bit longer.  We want to do the news just a little bit more.  And if Brian Williams can go fuck himself, then I'll stay a little longer.  No?  No, it's over, Tom.  I'm sorry.  We already had the commercials running for Brian Williams. 
[02:04:30]  You're done.  Wear the old fishing hat.  Talk about balloons by the lake.  What am I supposed to do?  I was in the woods, and I got lost.  I was so scared.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  That's for you to figure out.  Walk around.  Maybe I can get the Tom Brokaw Little Rascal Scooter.  That'll be dignified.  After being the great newscaster for so many years, there I'll be. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, let me turn the lights on.  This is a great-looking life I have now.  Listening to the old bags screaming all the time.  There I was on top of the Berlin Wall as it came down.  And now I'm hearing, Tom, time to take out the garbage.  It's your turn.  She has no clue what I went through.  There I was, the end of an era of the communists in Russia. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, you were there when they took down the Berlin Wall.  It came down.  Remember the shot of me giving the news as the big heavy hammers were coming down on the Berlin Wall?  Remember that?  Yeah, you had a lot of youth back then.  Now I get, put the goddamn seat down, Tom.  I like the toilet paper coming out under the roll, not over the top.  Like it makes a difference.  What?  Sometimes I have trouble catching my breath. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know why.  Like it makes a difference.  Tom, you have no place else to go.  I have no place else to go.  I have no place else.  Don't you do that.  Don't you do...  Gonna remind you of your lines, Tom.  Now that you're older.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Tommy. 
[02:06:30]  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Tommy.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  Don't you.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I...  Go...  What do I have?  What do I have?  I got nothing else.  You have nothing else, Tom.  Except a gerbil and his asshole.  Allegedly.  That old gag.  That old gag.  It's done. 
[02:07:00]  I'm...  You're finally done there, Tom.  I'm done.  I'm gonna have to take some time and sit.  I agree to do other stories for NBC, though, and I'm sure they'll really pay a lot of attention  to that and give it a lot of time.  Of course they will.  I want to do my documentary on the Whippoorwill.  I'm sure they'll just promote the shit out of that one.  Hope you have to get more promotion on XM than I will get on NBC News.  Tom, you sound a little woozy today.  Were you celebrating last night? 
[02:07:30]  Sharing some campaign with cake.  Yeah.  Sounds like you overindulged last night after the last broadcast.  Actually, I was hanging out at a downtown Manhattan bar with your own Ben's Parks.  Oh, that's why Ben's not here.  Yes.  We were tying one on.  I had a little bit of bad...  Sushi.  Sushi.  Sushi.  I had a little bit of bad...  You know, Tom, there's one thing I want to ask you.  You know, you don't have to answer to anyone anymore, and you seem a little woozy. 
[02:08:00]  This is true.  How do you really feel, just in general?  Well, I might as well put a bullet in my head.  I'd rather be on NBC Nightly News, but I was pushed out.  I actually didn't retire.  At least I don't have to leave in disgrace.  Well, how do you feel about your colleagues?  How do you feel about Katie Couric?  Katie Couric?  Yeah.  Her best segment was them, and they were snaking a tube up her ass live on television  for her asshole check-up. 
[02:08:30]  It was lovely.  They really showed her best side.  You thought that was pretty ridiculous, right?  Yeah, that was kind of ridiculous.  I would never do that.  What about Matt Lauer?  You don't have to hold back anymore.  Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  Matt Lauer.  Lauer.  Lauer.  Two words.  Faggot.  That's what I think about that.  Yeah, you can say that now.  I liked the colored guy when he was a little more rotund. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, what the hell is his name?  Al Roker?  Al Roker.  Al Roker.  You like the fat version of Al Roker?  I like the fat, jolly Al Roker.  The skinnier he gets, the more threatening he gets to me.  I don't know why that is.  I like the hey, hey, hey version.  A little better.  Like I walk up to him and go, hey, hey, hey.  And he'd go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  All right, well, I want to wish you luck there, Tom. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you.  Like I'm really talking to Tom.  Here I am.  Now signing off.  Yeah, for the last time.  For the last time.  Oh, please.  You know I'll be back on this program.  Half the impressions died.  You think I'm going to let this one go?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, exactly.  Not for a second.  All right, Tom.  Do a whole retrospective and listen to me say words like Achilles Loro.  Achilles Loro.  A what?  Where they threw poor Leon's king.  I was a nephew. 
[02:10:00]  Oh.  A terrorist Abu Abba.  Throwing Achilles Loro.  Up on the deck of the U.S.  JFK Jr., remember my, uh, report when he went down?  Oh, yeah.  And they took the, uh, the Navy ship's grasp.  Right.  And tried to find his body and that of his nagging wife that killed him.  Mm-hmm.  If the bitch only would have gotten off the cell phone and kept her yap shut, perhaps he would have landed.  Oh, don't mind me. 
[02:10:30]  I'm just watching television.  Um, Tom?  Yes.  Oh, I was a little woozy again.  It's time.  I'm nodding off.  I've been up late.  It's time for your final words.  You know what they have to be.  Is it NBC Nightly News?  No.  Is it?  It's the last words.  Is it courage?  It's the last words Anthony and I and Jim Norton said.  Is it what's the frequency, Kenneth?  When we got canceled.  I'm a little laugh.  Beat the shit out of that idiot.  At WNEW? 
[02:11:00]  You do know what you have to say?  Yes, I do.  Tom Brokaw, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  I wish we had the Hulk walking away music as you said that.  That would be nice, but.  We're here at St. Pat's and we're doing the balloon knot.  No?  No.  Can't use that line?  Where the hell is that?  I know it's here somewhere.  Press a button and pull a chain.  How comes a chocolate choo-choo-chop?  There it is, Tom. 
[02:11:30]  There it is.  Your mom's box.  It's time to go, Tom.  I say these words.  Your mom's box.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Wait, now that was your final words.  It has to be your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Okay, goodbye.  All right, bye.  Your mom's box.  No, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Say goodbye, then your mom's box. 
[02:12:00]  Your mom's box, goodbye.  No, the other way.  Who's on first?  Your final words have to be your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  NBC Nightly News.  I can ask.  All right.  Turn in tomorrow.  We're in some young fuck.  I'll be in my seat.  That's right.  Your mom's box.  All right.  Bye, Tom.  Nightly News.  All right.  Thank you.  Your mom's box.  All right, bye.  XM 202, the OPN Anthony Show.  Oh, God.  Psycho Mark.  Used to work for the show. 
[02:12:30]  Yep.  He got fired during one of our Sex for Sam things.  Right.  Needless to say, he's not working for the show anymore.  I don't know what he's up to.  We really need to get him back on the show.  Last I heard, he was working at Fox News, but now I hear no.  I hear that he's been fired from a few jobs now.  Since then?  I think he lost his radio gig, too.  I'm not positive.  Well, needless to say, he's unemployed.  Needless to say.  What was the radio gig that he had?  I honestly didn't know.  Alan Combs, he was helping out?  Needless to say.  Needless to say? 
[02:13:00]  That's what he says like 800 times during the interview.  Needless to say?  Come on.  Needless to say.  Needless to say.  Then don't say it.  This was one of the funniest things that happened to us after we got fired.  Gave us a few chuckles in our chuckle-less life back then.  Watching Psycho Mark be an expert on the OPN Anthony situation.  Yeah.  In a suit that they lent him.  I didn't have many laughs when we were on hiatus, whatever you want to call it.  But I would pop up this video from time to time and just laugh like an idiot.  I really would. 
[02:13:30]  Ben would call me.  I'd be in the middle of America somewhere.  He goes, dude, have you watched the video lately?  I'm like, no.  Watch a moron handle a news interview.  But this was the day we finally got to play the interview on the show and comment.  And it's pretty funny.  So check it out.  We have to go backwards a little bit.  But I forgot that we've never talked about this on the show.  Oh, the Psycho Mark.  In our time off, though, we've been quoting lines from this thing over and over again to each other. 
[02:14:00]  Ben thinks it's the funniest thing ever.  Oh, of course.  That was ever on TV.  And if you know Psycho Mark, unfortunately for the new listeners, they don't know who Psycho Mark is yet.  Where is Psycho Mark these days?  He's being very responsible as he works for Fox.  Is he still at Fox?  Yes.  What did he do there?  Where's Ben?  Ben would know.  See, now here we've got another guy who doesn't mind the U2.  That's the problem you get when you play music on your radio show.  Ben.  We could play like Hank Williams Jr.  And there'd be a ton of people going, all right, now the boys are talking.  And then the other people will turn us off. 
[02:14:30]  So, you know, we understand that game when we go to music here and there.  Here comes Ben.  He was just by the water machine.  Opie getting a little drink.  There he is.  Trying to water down his hair.  Keep it calm today.  Ben.  Yes.  We're going to play the Psycho Mark game.  That's hilarious.  This is hilarious.  What is Psycho Mark doing these days?  He's producing Alan Colmes' show.  Oh, is that what he does?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  He's producing a radio show.  And he also still works cameraman at Fox.  No?  Fox and Friends are one of those shows.  But this is hilarious because he's naming cities.  You guys weren't even on it. 
[02:15:00]  I remember when this happened.  Opie called me and he's like,  What the fuck is he doing?  Yeah.  He's way out of...  He's saying how he knows the leader of the Catholic League.  How he's a friend of his.  This was the first guy...  He just lost his mind.  Yeah.  This was the first guy that was even remotely involved with the show that was talking.  This was...  When did this air?  This was the day after.  This was the day after we got fired.  Or canceled.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cancel.  At this point.  Whatever.  It was a Friday.  It was a Friday morning.  Yeah.  This was the thing that happened on a Thursday.  So he was like the inside guy. 
[02:15:30]  Well, because they were trying to get...  You know, it was such a big thing, the Sex and St. Pat's, that they were trying to get  anyone on their air.  Yeah.  They wanted us, obviously.  They camped outside our residence for, I don't know, off and on for a couple weeks.  They wanted anybody involved with the show.  Anyone.  Steve.  Rick.  Anybody.  Ben.  Yeah.  Anyone that was even close.  Our agent.  No one was talking.  People that worked for Viacom.  No one was talking.  No one was talking except Psycho Mark gave the exclusive interview to Fox and Friends.  And they even goof on him a little bit at the beginning because he's wearing a suit  and he never wears a suit. 
[02:16:00]  He's like...  They're goofing on the fact that he's clean and he's got to give the suit back to the  guy he borrowed it from.  Right.  I guess they pick him up.  He was a regular employee.  He would help us out, but he also worked for Fox and Friends.  So he was like just a regular scumbag over at Fox and Friends.  But he had the exclusive on The Biggest Story of the Day.  So they treated him like a superstar.  They made sure he had a suit.  I think they even got him a limo that day to bring him to work.  Brushed his hair.  Brushed his hair and sat him down for the exclusive interview. 
[02:16:30]  The inside scoop on Opie and Anthony.  Wonderful.  This thing has made us laugh for the last two years.  I don't know if you'll find it as funny as we do, but we'll stop it.  You've got to also remember, especially the new listeners, this guy is out of his freaking  mind.  Oh, yeah.  That's why he's called Psycho Mark.  But he was using his broadcast voice all of a sudden.  Yeah.  Because this was a very serious day.  Yeah, he'd go from talking like this.  Let me tell you how fucked up we were last night.  Yeah, holy shit.  He'll talk about the collards in Boston with this really bad voice.  Yeah, the collards. 
[02:17:00]  They love keeping them in their own fucking area up there in Boston.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  And then he's like, hey, how are you doing, guys?  Right.  So.  I use the radio voice now.  Here's the audio.  We'll stop it.  Unfortunately for a couple of guys who are making millions of dollars a year, Opie and  Anthony in New York City, they were fired yesterday after a couple was caught having  sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And it was all being broadcast on their radio show.  Joining us now with some exclusive details is a member of that cast, Mark Walsh, better 
[02:17:30]  known as Opie and Anthony, on those Opie and Anthony listeners at Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Hi, guys.  Good to have me on.  How are you?  Thanks for having me on.  Like he's a general talking about the war.  Thanks for having me on.  And like Jim Cook.  And right after this interview, he went right behind the camera again and filmed Fox and  Fred.  Yeah.  Thanks for having me on.  Wasn't he miking people back then?  Oh, that's what he was.  That's what his job was.  He would put the little microphones on.  Thanks for having me on.  Before the interview. 
[02:18:00]  On those Opie and Anthony listeners at Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Mark, it's a thrill to see you again, especially clean.  Thrilled to see you again.  Thrilled to see you again.  They see him every day as he's miking the guests.  He works with you.  He works with you, you idiot.  You've got to be like me going, hey, Jimmy, thrilled to see you again.  Right.  Like, oh, he doesn't stop by very often, but good thing he's here today.  All kidding aside, Ed, thanks for having me on.  Oh, no problem.  You're making it sound like he's their expert for things in the media.  Yeah.  You know, he comes on from time to time.  Good to see you again.  Like you said, the war correspondent. 
[02:18:30]  Especially clean.  Yeah, exactly.  With a suit and everything.  I know.  I didn't know you were.  I feel like a pundit, you know.  Give it back to John Scott at the end of the show.  That's part of the deal.  Fair deal.  But, Mark, let's talk seriously what happened.  Fred was the one, our producer here, to inform you about what happened.  You've talked to Opie and Anthony since.  He did not talk to us.  I'm watching this at home going, Mark did not talk to me.  No.  Mark didn't talk to Anthony.  Uh-uh.  Anthony and I pretty much shut off our cell phones and went into hiding.  Yeah.  My own mom and dad didn't talk to me. 
[02:19:00]  No one talked.  No one talked to us.  And Psycho Mark was not.  We were pretty damn depressed about losing our careers.  No one was talking to us.  Psycho Mark was not spoken to.  I didn't talk for a week, maybe two weeks.  Did you hear the first line?  I've memorized this thing.  It's so funny.  What happened?  You've talked to Opie and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting fans?  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  Psycho Mark.  Wow, adding some real new information there. 
[02:19:30]  It was a bad thing.  This is a guy that held up the C word on live TV for us.  But all of a sudden, he's going to throw us out to dry there.  Well, it was a bad thing.  Whenever you use the term needless to say twice in a row, you have nothing to say afterwards.  Needless to say, I have nothing to say, nothing to say.  Let it be known, we've never said this.  He was the guy that held up the C-U-N-T sign on live TV.  Yeah, that was him, wasn't it?  Yes, it was.  Yeah, he's also the guy that jumped on the front of the voyeur bus and hung on to the windshield wipers as it drove down the street. 
[02:20:00]  Pounding, let me in, let me in.  And bragging that he hit an ounce of pot somewhere on the bus, so they had to take the bus apart.  Like ants take apart a grasshopper.  That's what they did to the voyeur bus, because Psycho Mark was bragging that he hit an ounce on it.  Guys, they're arresting us right now.  Yeah, they're arresting us, but I hit my pot in one of the seats.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  They'll never fucking find it. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, I've got to put on my smooth guy boy.  The cops are coming.  This is the same guy.  I mean, we love the guy, trust me.  Oh, don't get us wrong.  We love the guy.  This guy's a pisser.  He does great radio for us, but this thing is unbelievable.  To inform you about what happened, you've talked to Obi and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting his head?  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  What happened was entirely wrong, and the boys are very upset that it even happened.  The boys?  The boys are very upset. 
[02:21:00]  The boys.  Oh, my God.  The boys.  It's like a father talking about his kids.  The boys are very upset with what happened.  Well, do it again.  Needless to say, I mean, it was needless to say a bad thing.  The entire stunt was entirely wrong.  It's like, geez, he's got four words he's saying.  He's beyond nervous, though.  This is his big moment in the spotlight.  What I'm saying is needless.  Yeah, the boys are really, they knew they had to get the papers, get the papers.  Needless to say, needless to say.  What I'm saying is needless to say.  Then we're off to the fire. 
[02:21:30]  The boys are very upset.  I know.  I was listening to that.  It's hilarious.  Oh, the boys.  It happened.  What was at stake here was a trip to the Sam Adams plant up in Massachusetts, and whoever  got the most points would get the free trip, right?  Exactly.  And the way you get points is you go around town, and the couples would engage in lewd acts  in different places.  All right, listen to me.  And I just remembered something.  Didn't he go with you that day?  What's that?  Yeah.  He followed you that day with your couple.  Yeah.  So he was actually in there. 
[02:22:00]  So far, he's got the facts straight, though, except the fact that he talked to you.  The boys were upset.  Oh, right.  And the reason, by the way, needless to say, needless to say, that he's working at Fox anyway  is because he got fired from his job at WNEW.  And why did he get fired?  For the second annual Sex for Sam contest, when he took his couple into our boss's office  and made them have anal sex on the couch of our general manager, while our program director 
[02:22:30]  was looking through the glass door going, no, don't do that.  And Psycho Mark spun his head around, looked at our program director, and said to his couple,  guys, go for it.  Yeah, live on the air.  What was the program director doing besides instructing the girl how to relax before she  took a cock in her ass?  You just won't let that go, that you didn't get your raise before you got fired.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:23:00]  Anyway, so this is who they have on Fox and Friends.  And he is our pal, but I think it's just hilarious.  You know, in different places.  So they'd have sex in different places.  Exactly.  For points, and then someone picked the St. Patrick's Cathedral, and even with a 40-second  delay, you guys aired it?  Well, what happened before the show was, and it was explained to everybody that took part  in the show, do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  That is a flat-out lie.  That's a lie, too. 
[02:23:30]  We didn't even bring up the word St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Church was on the list.  Yeah.  We kind of told the people, you know, did we even tell them to steer clear of the churches?  I don't think we did.  No, not really.  I think it was on the list, but we assumed...  We were going to control it from where we sat.  Yeah.  We did a great job, didn't we?  We weren't going to take any calls from, like, a church, but...  Or if we did, we were going to, like, play it in a way that we would have probably saved  our asses.  Yeah, but when we plunked the phone line down and Paul Mercurio just said, we're here 
[02:24:00]  at St. Pat's and they're doing the balloon knot, it was kind of too late.  No turning back.  Could have punched the dump button, though.  All right, here's...  Could have should have would have.  Here's more Psycho Mark.  Two of my favorite things are still coming up.  Buddy, that took part in the show.  Do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Can I just jump in real quick?  I mean, any church, there was, like, 25 points that you could get for going into a church.  Wouldn't you just think any church would blow people's minds?  Well, most of the stuff that happens is, it's radio, it's on air, it's a description, 
[02:24:30]  it's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So to speak.  He's an expert on radio.  Radio, it's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So you have a theater and a mind, neither of which I'm in possession of at this moment.  What makes it funny, if you know Psycho Mark like we know...  What a tool, I love it.  I love it.  How did you guys get Ron Serling to do an interview on your behalf? 
[02:25:00]  Pitiful portrait, exactly.  Of a dumped duo.  Exactly.  Submitted for your approval, Opie and Anthony.  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute, are you saying...  What?!  Those acts aren't necessarily happening, but they are as described on the air.  Described as on the air.  Described as on the air.  Yeah.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Bling, bling, bling.  He's doing gymnastics with the English language.  Exactly.  What is he trying to say here?  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute, are you saying they didn't really have sex because the usher says the people were partially naked?  I'm not going to get into the...  If they wanted to do a theater to the line, they would have been in a car outside and said,  We're inside the church, okay.  Well, what happened was there was a fail-safe system on a show. 
[02:26:00]  There's a 40-second delay that they use.  In other words, they have up to 10 times to dump out of the show within 40 seconds.  So if something gets aired that's inappropriate, there's an opportunity to take it off the show.  So why didn't they dump it?  Well, that's what happened.  There's a whole chain of command, the system that works with the program director and the general manager.  Both suspended.  Well, they both have boxes in their office and are able to dump out of the show at any time.  Now, they should have been on The Post that afternoon monitoring the show.  Now, these guys, it's Opie and Anthony.  You know, you're not talking about...  You don't go to them for news, weather and sports. 
[02:26:30]  This is not Paul Harvey.  Exactly.  You don't tune in to Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  Ah, he almost said dick jokes.  They're shock jocks.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  You've got to stay on top of them.  You've got to stay on top of them.  Mark, we spent half our time.  I've got to stay on top of you, you idiot.  Oh, God.  How he is portraying himself in this is really funny.  He's coming off like he's the responsible guy.  The voice of reason.  Yeah.  A gentleman.  The voice of reason.  And I'm sitting here in my suit criticizing. 
[02:27:00]  Man.  Exactly.  You don't tune in to Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  Right.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  So yesterday they got fired.  The general manager and the program director have been suspended.  Are they going to get canned, too?  Most likely.  And what happened is the formats will probably change at the station.  You'll probably see a switch probably to light music.  Gotcha.  You're kidding me.  So they're going to lose all that talk and that dramatic switch that no Carmesan made happen.  Well, they're on several markets as well. 
[02:27:30]  They're number one in Philly.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Detroit.  Detroit.  That's the only thing he's got wrong so far, really.  His facts are right.  They did go to it.  What a good call.  Yeah, well, he kind of knew that.  They were going to light FM.  I mean, after the thing that blinked didn't work, they went right to light FM.  He's right.  And we're on in Detroit.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Let me think of another city.  Detroit.  They go to another station to do their show from there. 
[02:28:00]  Because they were fired from Boston.  Exactly.  They were also fired from...  They're doing something.  But you know what?  I spoke to them last night.  Is that correct, Mark?  Yes, for the mayor's death.  Yeah, they may believe the mayor died.  But this is Opie and Anthony.  I mean, these guys, they said the mayor was dead on April Fool's Day.  I mean, come on.  Who's going to really believe him?  Ultimately, this just...  How many people know who to take from first?  Come on!  Ultimately, though, this shows you how far afield shock jocks have gotten.  I mean, it used to be just Howard Stern just talking quasi-dirty, but now we're having sex in a church. 
[02:28:30]  The Catholic League, with 350 members, now says, you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  He says, when does the Catholic League have 350 members?  Yeah.  You think he's off?  A little bit.  I didn't hear that, actually.  Yeah.  The Catholic League, with its 350 members...  Now, it says, you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license. 
[02:29:00]  So they're stepping away from it.  Which is a fair shot.  And they had every right to be mad.  I mean, Bill Donahue is a good guy, and he had every right to be upset.  He's not a good guy!  What an ass.  He's never talked to Bill Donahue.  Yeah, he did.  He had him on the Fox show once, and he put a microphone on him.  That's what Mark did.  He told me.  He goes, I had Bill Donahue sitting in the chair, and I clipped a little clip-on microphone  on him, and turned on the little battery pack, and that was it.  But he's not a good guy. 
[02:29:30]  He's an arrogant demagogue and a douche.  Wants to push his morality on everybody.  Yeah, well, you know, I sat down and spoke with him.  He's a good guy.  Could you say check one, two?  Thank you.  That's the extent of our conversation.  Highest asshole he was.  I mean, Bill Donahue is a good guy, and he had every right to be upset.  Real quickly, did they ever talk, Opie and Anthony, did they ever sit there and say,  well, maybe this is going over the line, or was it just like, hey, let's push the envelope?  With that show, it happened so fast. 
[02:30:00]  In other words, it made the air, and it's like, you know, you stepped in crap.  Oh, God, you know, what do you do?  You're in it.  And it was too late.  Can we believe that out?  It was hardly there.  Mark, my last question, are they going to sue to get their jobs back?  Because this is what they do.  They might have a lawyer.  Chances are they'll probably, they're in negotiations right now with another company,  and we'll probably see them back on the air shortly.  So they'll take millions of dollars from CBS for leaving and go get another job someplace else.  Most likely, that's exactly what's going to happen.  All right, Mark Walsh, thanks very much for giving us the exclusive details on the morning show. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, Robin.  All right, thanks very much.  He's got a house impression.  That was the best part.  He goes, I know for a fact they're negotiating with another company.  I'm sitting home going, really?  Really?  We're negotiating, huh?  Why don't you tell us who that is?  It only took two years and three months to get back on the radio, Mark.  Yeah, that's all.  We're negotiating a day after being canceled.  That's most likely what will happen in the Twilight Zone.  Really?  Bob Eatman is currently on the right wing of an aircraft. 
[02:31:00]  My brother's on the wing.  You've got to open the door.  We just find that very funny because we know the guy.  He was definitely trying to help us out, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  No, Mark is trying to help himself out.  Mark loves attention.  And when they said, hey, why don't you come on and talk about ONA?  You think he was going to say, well, I really don't have that much information.  Or, get me the suit and turn on the camera.  Get me the suit. 
[02:31:30]  Get me the ride.  And I'm in.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  Needless to say, you know, needless to say.  The entire thing was entirely exactly.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Exactly.  My entire interview was needless to say.  Entirely.  Exactly.  Let me say, exactly entirely.  Bill Donahue's a good guy. 
[02:32:00]  You know, Hitler was really criticized.  No one really looks at all the good he did.  Mussolini was a great oil painter.  That's our old pal.  We'll get him back on the air eventually.  You know, he kept the trains on time.  Exactly.  You'd look at your watch and say, the train is supposed to come in at nine.  Is it on time?  Exactly.  Exactly on time.  Oh, really? 
[02:32:30]  Do I need a schedule?  Or, needless to say, needless to have schedule.  There's a platform full of frightened people, but needless to say, they'll all be hustled into  the cars and moved along.  He's too much.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's going to be hot on those cars.  Exactly.  Needless to say, they should be hosed down.  Maybe give some chocolates to the people at the next station to hose them down.  They were indeed kept together when they had arrived at the family camps. 
[02:33:00]  And before they got on, there was a discussion, don't go to Auschwitz.  Don't go to Auschwitz.  Exactly.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Anyway, we're going to play a bit.  I don't want any part of this one, actually.  Why?  It's that whole Connor Peterson thing that you guys get into.  It's hysterical.  You guys just laugh like little girls when we bring up the Connor Peterson case.  It's hysterical.  And I don't know.  I remember this was the time I got very uncomfortable because I think you two basically went off on  a tangent about really bad baby t-shirts. 
[02:33:30]  T-shirts that they make for babies.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There was a website or something?  T-shirthell.com.  I don't know.  You know what?  I have to listen to this bit again because I really don't remember this one.  So take a listen to this.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Do we have that story about the...  Which one now?  The baby's t-shirts.  Oh, I think so.  Somewhere in this pile.  Because I was laughing at the fact that they were outraged by the one that they used as  an example.  Shocking awe for baby t-shirts?  Baby t-shirts.  Now, these kind of risque, kind of shocking t-shirts are available for little infants, 
[02:34:00]  for babies now.  Mm-hmm.  And they're kind of funny sayings.  With titles like Hot Babe, Mommy's Little Monster, Diva, Serial Killer.  Or, Serial spelt like cereal, like, you know, meat, cereal.  Yeah.  10% soft spot, 90% bitch.  There you go.  Is that a shirt?  Yes, it is.  Well, according to me, now it is.  That's very funny.  I just chimed in with that and made it up. 
[02:34:30]  That's a good one.  Thank you.  But, you know, I was reading their examples, and there's an outrage because of these shirts.  But the examples they give are nothing compared to some of them I've seen.  Well, here's one that they're really pissed off at.  A t-shirt that says, bitch, better have my bottle.  Oh, that must get them angry.  And Sir Crapsalot.  Sir Crapsalot.  They're among the hottest sellers.  You don't like Sir Crapsalot?  No, I don't.  You should say Ben on it. 
[02:35:00]  There's another baby t-shirt, Anthony.  Yeah.  That says, my mom puts out.  Wow.  I like that.  Now, I've never seen these.  And then the mom is, of course, saying, but I'll bet my husband wishes it was true.  Ha, ha, ha.  And the one that was tasteless, though, that one from California, there was only the one  kid that wore it, and it just said, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub.  You're so obsessed. 
[02:35:30]  I don't really understand why, but you're so obsessed with that trial.  Thank God that trial is just about over.  What trial?  Thank God it's just about over.  It's a little.  And we can finally move on.  Is that the little shirt?  It's a little shirt, and you can wash it as many times as you want, and it won't shrink  because it's used to being in the water.  Right.  And it's got a little arrow pointing one way and says, I'm with mommy who wouldn't shut 
[02:36:00]  up.  No?  Whew.  Aw.  And another t-shirt, Anthony, that says, where's all the bitches at?  Where's all the bitches at?  Now, you're saying these shirts are tame compared to the other ones that you've seen out there?  One of my favorite sites is t-shirthell.com.  Okay.  You ever go there?  No.  Very funny t-shirts.  And they have a whole baby section.  And these are much better than the ones they give examples for.  Imagine you're a little toddler wearing a shirt that says, now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice. 
[02:36:30]  Now, that's kind of funny.  I tore mommy a new one.  Another one reads, Chinese delicacy.  Do they cook, child?  Did you get this one, Anthony?  Now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice?  Yes.  That's the one I just read.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, because someone's distracting me.  Oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  I have no idea.  No wonder you can't remember who made the mess. 
[02:37:00]  What?  Well, you guys don't understand.  During the radio show, I'm taking my headphones off, turning microphones off, giving instructions,  receiving communiques.  This one's cool.  Yeah.  I tore mommy a new one.  All right.  I heard that one, you ass.  You were coming off as an insane person today.  I know, but whose Rolaids are these?  Rolaids in my studio.  Oh, Peter, get the suntan lotion. 
[02:37:30]  You know there are times during the show I'm taking my headphones off, turning microphones  off, and trying to find other stuff to enhance some of these bits that we do.  Right.  So I got caught.  I got caught napping on that one.  I'm sorry.  How about this one?  Fuck the milk.  Where's the whiskey tits?  There you go.  You're a little toddler being...  Yeah, that's a real one.  You could buy it.  Did you say the one...  I pray you didn't.  They shake me?  No, I didn't say that.  Well, how funny is that as a shirt for you little kid? 
[02:38:00]  That's a little crazy.  Kid walking around with a they shake me t-shirt.  Yeah.  How about daddy drinks because I cry?  Did you do that one?  No.  No, I didn't do that one.  I enjoy a good spanking.  Playground pimp.  Daddy's milk is saltier than mommy's.  Oh, that's not a t-shirt.  This one has a big pot leaf on the front, and it's a little t-shirt for your baby, and  it says potty head.  You know, a little play on pot head, potty head. 
[02:38:30]  Did you read the one hung like a five-year-old?  That's very funny.  Daddy's lil squirt, and it says L-I-L.  It's spelled lil.  What about this one that just says broken condom?  Those are some funny shirts.  Oh, my IQ is higher than the president's.  The old I can kick your baby's ass. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Those are a little more offensive than the examples they gave.  And I hide my crack in my diaper.  oh there's one from  this is a weird one  if you're in Florida  in 1981  don't lose your head  oh my god  oh my god  then there's ones  t-shirt hell is great  they have t-shirts  for everybody  not just for kids  there are some 
[02:39:30]  really really  offensive ones  arrest black babies  before they become  criminals  that's what it says  I thought it was a  voice post  who the hell  would get that  this one really  offensive  you know the  I love New York  shirts  I heart New York  they have I  and then in place  of the heart  they have an airplane  a jet aircraft  I plane New York  yeah  people  I mean this is 
[02:40:00]  t-shirt hell  and this is in the  extreme section  but there  I would defy  anyone to walk  around wearing  one of these  Jesus did it  for the chicks  abortions tickle  that's funny  oh my god  great white kill  it's a headline  on a shirt  great white  kills every single  one of it's  hundred fans  wow  I swear I didn't  know she was  three 
[02:40:30]  that's my  favorite one  oh  I didn't know  she was  if Asians were  so smart  how'd they wind  up with such  tiny dicks  help stop  rape  consent  that's nice  t-shirt hell  there you go  oh god  I can't even  read that one  why  I found one  I can't even  read  really  Norton read it 
[02:41:00]  where is it  it's right here  Norton will take  pleasure in reading  it I guarantee  he's laughing  you're not gonna  read it  is it a ton  yeah  love him or hate  him  Hitler killed a ton  of Jews  holy yes  are you insane  who's walking  around with that  yeah  Byron  picture of

[02:42:00]  at a National  Action Network  dinner in April  of 2001  nice picture of  Reverend Al  and what looks  like I have to  say it  a man  dude  or a transvestite  Reverend Al's  been getting a lot  serious air  time over the  past few years  and I didn't  even know he  was married  he's been  married 24  years to a  woman that  it's a guy  well if you  just saw the  picture of this  girl and put it  on the website  I would say 
[02:42:30]  that half the  people would  guess that this  is a man  all kidding  aside  everyone would  think it's a  guy in drag  without Reverend  Al on the picture  I know this is  radio but  let me take a  look maybe we'll  get the picture  up online  look at that  that is a man  you would say  that's a man  right  I would bet a  lot of money  that's a man  absolutely say  it's a man  big shoulders  the face  is a man's  face  that is a  man's face  that Reverend  Al's had to  kiss every night  for 24 years  maybe it's just  a bad picture  that's been 
[02:43:00]  known to happen  let me take a  little quick peek  yeah big  big head  big shoulders  and it's a  man's face  with like a  weave  like a big  jerry curled  weave on it  looks like  Jackie from  Risky Business  this is the  first time  I feel sorry  for Reverend  Al  I didn't know  he was bedding  that for 24  years  yeah well  here's the  story  Reverend Al  and wife  to split  after 24  years of  marriage  Al Sharpton 
[02:43:30]  and his  wife Kathy  are splitting  up  the couple  announced  the separation  today  Sharpton's  representative  blah blah blah  confirmed to  the Daily News  it's entirely  amicable  the representative  of Sharpton  of course it is  it's always  amicable  it's always  amicable  in the news  alright  they are on  the best of  terms  but at this  point  their daughters  are grown  and they want  to pursue  their separate  interests  are they  dodging them  rumors  the couple  had grown  distant  have dogged  Sharpton  for months 
[02:44:00]  so this  rumor's been  out there  a while  yep  alright  blah blah blah  Kathy is getting  back to  entertainment  as a consultant  Al Sharpton  told the news  in July  she runs  on her  track  and I  run  on mine  that's what  we promised  each other  when our  kids got  older  god damn  these headphones  are going to  drive me  absolutely nuts  I don't think it's the headphones  mine are clipping a little bit  there too  they're now clipping  yeah I think it's something  with the  alright sorry  it makes me stop  talking  ah just talk  alright Sharpton met  his future wife  Kathy Lee Jordan 
[02:44:30]  in 1979  when she was a backup singer  for his mentor  James Brown  looked like Michael Jordan  so she used to sing backup  for James Brown  really  they married in Vegas  the couple have two daughters  18 and 17  he blah blah blah  blah blah blah  blah blah blah  I'm just trying to get  to the good stuff  last night Sharpton  was to attend  rapper Sean P. Diddy Combs  35th birthday party  oh did he show up  with actress Robin Givens  ex-wife of boxer Mike Tyson  Reverend Al was supposed  to go with Robin Givens

[02:45:30]  if he's hanging  with Robin Givens  it's better than the guy  he's with for 24 years  that's a man  I'm going to defend  Reverend Al  it might be just a bad picture  the name of his TV show  is called  I Hate My Job  I Hate My Job  that's one of those  black shows  so it should be called  I Have a Job  sorry  it was easy  one minute I get blasted  if I have all men around me  he said  then I get blasted  if I have women  what does that mean?  he gets blasted  for having all men around him  because one of them  is his wife  that is a guy  yeah well

[03:13:00]  product coming out  that wirelessly  like you can play  against your buddies  like wirelessly  you know  whatever  it's like sort of  a cell phone  and so you know  we've got this scene  and I'm up in this tree  and you know  I'm playing against Chris  he's charging around  on this big elephant  and you know  they've got chicken  tied to the tree  the tree branch  I'm on  so there's these  three huge African lions  like jumping up  to try and get the meat  and I'm sitting  on this branch  you know  and I tell them  I go  why  you know  what is going 
[03:13:30]  to stop  these fucking lions  I love saying fuck  what's going  to stop  these fucking lions  from just climbing  up the tree  and killing you  and killing you  dragging you off  by the throat  and they're like  oh don't worry dude  lions can't climb  trees dude  you know  like lions  don't climb trees  so I'm just thinking  and then our director  says yeah  but that is  a pretty mellow tree  so there I am  I'm out on this branch  it's like  ten feet above the ground  take one  you know  drop the slate  and then  the lion bolts  straight up  the goddamn tree dude  like

[03:15:00]  yeah  there's been  some things  yeah  absolutely  I mean  and overall  jackass  we were  putting ourselves  at risk  of bumps  and bruises  yeah  it's just  straight up  shit  this is  putting yourself  at risk  these things  can kill you  when you guys  went in the water  with the bear  yeah  that was really  sketchy  that was really  kind of scary  there was a time  when we jumped  off the boat  and you know  I should mention  too that  actually  yesterday  out in the stores 
[03:15:30]  came out  our wild boys  complete first season  DVD  oh  got picked that up  and if you thought  the show was gay  wait till you  watch the extras  there's full  anal intercourse  yeah  oh my god  and how about  a moment of silence  for Chris Bonnius  we just had his  bachelor party  oh he's getting  married  yeah he's getting  married this Friday  to Steve-O  you know what  in San Francisco  well no  in Massachusetts  it's where it's legal  so I told him  when I first heard  about it 
[03:16:00]  I said  Chris  you know  we need to go  to Massachusetts  and get married  with a prenup  and then  we need to go  to Utah  and then  you can start  adding spouses  if you expect  any silence  at your wedding  out of me  so he's getting  married  and it is  a lovely  young lady  she is  yeah  she's a lovely  Irish lass  yeah  see now  that's somebody  I would assume  was completely gay  based on his character  yeah no  Chris really isn't  gay at all either  and even though  I think the marriage 
[03:16:30]  you know  like whether or not  I'm a dick  for saying it  I think the marriage  has a lot to do  with getting  his Irish lass  a green card  oh she's like  right from Ireland  yeah yeah yeah  oh so it could be  like a set up  kind of one hand  washed with the other  she gets a green card  he gets a beard  so it doesn't look  so gay  he could say  you know  look  I can't be gay  I'm married  to a lovely  young lady  yeah  no that's his term  but the bachelor party  was very interesting  on Monday night  old Knoxville  couldn't make it  so he arranged  he sent us 
[03:17:00]  some strippers  filming another movie  is he  yeah  that guy has  probably the best  agent ever  ever  that guy turns up  in everything  he's on fire  yeah  I think he's up  to like 5 million  a movie now  really  yeah  but all he ever  wanted in the beginning  was to be an end  you know  it was a means to an end  which he called out  and nobody can call him  a hypocrite or a sell out  because  no the guy took a lot  of pain to get where he is  he did exactly  what he intended to do  that bean bag gun  that was shot  at his abdomen  I know  oh man  what's he gonna get 
[03:17:30]  shot with next  well he got shot  for real  but they never  showed it on MTV  what the  yeah  he put on a  bulletproof vest  oh the bulletproof vest  where is that video  can you see that anywhere  does he have that now  he got shot in the desert  with a bulletproof vest on  but MTV refused to show  yeah  and that was a video  that was put out  by Larry Flint  publications  oh there you go  so it is out there  somewhere  it's out there  but they didn't license  any of the damn music  for it  so you know  oh really  so should they want  to do anything with it 
[03:18:00]  you know  it's just like one  you know  lawsuit after another  great  I mean I'm glad  I'm on the radio  telling Brad about that  yeah fuck you Larry  what's he gonna do  yeah  so anyway  Knoxville sent some strippers  to Chris's bachelor party  and um  they were dudes  oh no  yeah  and uh  just to make it worse  they were wearing  all this crazy bondage gear  and giving each other  blowjobs  in the middle of the party 
[03:18:30]  great party  wow  great party  isn't it  yeah  like honest to god  I think it's the only  bachelor party  in the history of the world  that  that the bride  wasn't concerned about  you know  like it was  gay sex  going on  it was  it was  it was the first time  I've ever actually  seen a dude  give another dude  a blowjob  oh  yeah that can't be  much of a treat  to watch  well I don't know  guy pulls away  and he's got that  razor burn  on his testicles 
[03:19:00]  I was posing  for all kinds of  pictures  like right  kind of  in the scene  too  I didn't care  of course not  dude I saw something  when you were on  John McEnroe's show  we're actually  taping John McEnroe  today  I think they're  bringing in a film  crew right  in a little while  are they  because you're  going to do some  stunts  maybe you  yeah I came  totally unprepared  and I walked  straight off  an airplane  in here  we'll figure  something out  you usually do  remember the thing  we set up  at the old station 
[03:19:30]  where he jumped  over the console  oh yeah  that knocked  off the on air  sign  yeah  yeah  he broke the place  yeah that was a brilliant  laugh  but he was on  John McEnroe a couple  weeks ago  and he let  Johnny Mac  serve into his body  serve tennis balls  wow that must have hurt  the welts you had  were ridiculous  I told him that  I wasn't too afraid  because he was  well over the hill  dude he had  pissed him off  John McEnroe  didn't hold back  at all  the welts he had  at the end of the show  were crazy  how fast do you think 
[03:20:00]  he served  I don't know man  but  they were up there  you took one  just off the testicle  upper thigh  how far away were you  max 30 feet  yeah 30 feet  and he's connecting  like that  he's still like  got his aim  pretty much full serve  pretty much full serve  still able to aim though  and get hit  I was wearing a cup  and I told him to aim for it  but he kept getting me  in the thighs  I think he took like  three shots  something like that  I know yeah  and then he finally goes  that's it  yeah  I kind of ran out of the scene  he got him on the soft spot  on the upper thigh 
[03:20:30]  he's like that's it  I'm done  well yeah  I mean  that was pretty crazy  did you ever play  asses up handball  years ago  and then you try to  get the ball to bounce  off the wall  and back into his nuts  you try to hit him  in the ass  in front of this guy  no I'm just saying  that's what you're doing  that would hurt  did I perform the butt chug  on the show  with you guys one time  oh yes  you did the butt chug  he did do the butt chug  of course he did  yeah I took a funnel  with the hose  and I put it in my butt  beer in his butt  yeah  and then I tried 
[03:21:00]  to fart beer in my mouth  yeah  I really don't know  how to do that  dude  oh yeah  how do you talk  something like that  I don't know  we got a show off  for Steve-O today  we got to get a couple  to have sex for him  oh my god  that's what happened  to you guys  you guys solicited  pretty serious crimes  to occur in churches  crimes to the church  crimes to humanity  you kind of heard  about our little story  I was just  I was prouder than can be  at the end of the day  or at the end of that day 
[03:21:30]  I guess  I really thought  that it would all  work out for the better  and I guess  now it ultimately has  yeah but it was  two years  it took two years  we haven't seen you  in like two  two and a half years  it was two years  of exile  just doing nothing  absolutely nothing  trying to just  X-ing off the days  on the calendar  that's pretty  because I really thought  that overnight  that that would turn  into the best thing  that ever happened to you  eventually it will be  the best thing  that happened  yeah  eventually  we're still eking it out 
[03:22:00]  it definitely made us  a little bigger  but  that's funny  yeah  in that time  I've been arrested  for international  drug smuggling  have you  yeah  drug smuggling  yeah it was amazing  and what happened there  were you a mule  no I  well no it was really  only for the  for the purposes  of filming  one of my DVDs  like I was in Norway  and you know  we were getting ready  to go to the airport  to fly to Sweden  and I had all this hash  and  did you tape it  to your body  and  no no even better  even better  end up in a Turkish prison 
[03:22:30]  I took a condom  and I put all this  marijuana and hash  in the condom  and I tied it up  in a knot  and  swallowed it  and it was really  it was such an ambitious  like  such an ambitious  package to swallow  so like  really  really  was it kind of big  I choked on it  I got stuck in my throat  how the hell do you swallow  something like that  yeah it got stuck in my throat  and I was choked on it  I was puking up blood  trying to get it out  did you just think  oh my god  if I die doing this  like as you're doing it  like oh no  they're gonna  Steve-O found with hash 
[03:23:00]  and pot  and stuck in his throat  and condom  and yeah  swallowed it down  because you remember  when I was  you know  I came in  I was promoting my first video  and there was  the dog ate the condom  so I figured  if a dog can do it  then so can I  you know  and so  I saw this  condom for a pot  and a hash  and it took  it took seven days  for me to finally  crap it out  because I was  that was just  it was my vision  you know  I crap  I crap it out  and then  you know  open it up  it was his vision  my vision  yeah  did every crap  you went picking through 
[03:23:30]  it  no nothing  like a prospector  I filmed it too  and you know  my whole idea  like the punchline  is you know  like finally  I take the pot out  you know  and uh  you know  roll a joint  or whatever  and I smoke  and  now that's good shit  you know  and I was all excited  about it  and uh  over the  over the six days  I spent  touring Sweden  um  I spent  I bragged  to the media  every newspaper  every TV show  how are you doing  well  I uh  I think I might  die of intestinal strangulation  because I've got  all this marijuana 
[03:24:00]  in my body  you know  like  and where it turns out  Sweden has like  the strictest drug laws  in Europe  really  so yeah  so  who knew that  right after I pooped it out  and got my punchline  and I was so happy  then uh  the next morning  I got ambushed  by undercover cops  leaving the Swedish hotel  and uh  I spent five days  in Swedish prison  how is Swedish prison  it's really pretty mellow man  it sounds kinda nice  you're in a Swedish prison  I know  they give you a cocoa  with marshmallows  I was able to smoke cigarettes  and then  I could even 
[03:24:30]  they took me to buy  junk food  and cigarettes  just puffing away  I mean granted  I had to poop  into plastic bags  in front of dudes  for five days in a row  oh they wanted to see  what else you had in there  yeah because they weren't  entirely convinced  what a crap job  they have  I know  and I was making fun  of them too  for doing my job  taking through crap  you know  really  but yeah  and I had that  and then uh  I also had um  for a while  I was facing  eight years in prison  on two felony charges  out of Louisiana 
[03:25:00]  stemming from  stapling my scrotum  to my thigh  yeah  I read about that  we read about that one  yeah that was  big big trouble  what was that  an obscene  yeah it was  another case of obscenity  which uh  yeah  you know I mean  I'd like  I'll go ahead  and call myself  a celebrity  and uh  that's so funny  but like the truth  is no celebrities  have ever been  convicted of obscenity  like there's  no  like Jim Morrison  Larry Flint  Marilyn Manson  two live crew  Lenny Bruce  yeah  the list just goes  on and on  and uh 
[03:25:30]  um  so yeah  I'm really proud  like I feel like  stapling my balls  to my leg  really let me join  this group  of American heroes  you know  but you were in a club  yeah I was in a club  yeah and uh  so the people in the club  knew what they were  getting  yeah it was an audience  when like you walked  into a restaurant  in front of a family  and started doing it  and there was  an isolated incident  that had nothing to do  with me with uh  you know  a bouncer's injuring  an audience member  which kind of brought  all the attention to it  so they threw the book  at me for obscenity 
[03:26:00]  and  is this your mug shot  yeah  check out how bummed I am  oh man  you look bummed  I was in so much trouble  dude  I don't know  yeah we got the arrest report  anybody can make fun of me  jackass star  steve-o  aka steven glover  was arrested in august 2002  that was when we got  screwed over  oh look at that  what day was it man  uh  do you know offhand  I was arrested  I think it was like  august 1st or something  oh okay  um  we destroyed our lives  on august 16th  if you're playing along  at home  yeah  actually the 15th 
[03:26:30]  I had  I had  you know  I was really in a lot  of trouble  and ultimately  the courts  you know  like uh  I guess the judge  reviewed the tape  of my performance  and  and uh  it came down  it was the court decision  that stapling your balls  to your leg  is an act of art  and it's protected  anything is an act of art  and it's protected  if you do it  that's amazing  I know  I know  like I'm glad  the state of Louisiana  really considers me  to be this  artist  Louisiana  were there 
[03:27:00]  were there cops  in the place  no no no no  I got arrested  on a fugitive warrant  two weeks later  how did that happen  it was because  an audience member  had been videotaping it  and they thought  wow that was messed up  and they sent the tape  to the news  which thought  wow that's probably  pretty illegal  and then the news  probably pretty illegal  yeah then the news  sent it to uh  to the cops  and then by  you know  it was two weeks later  I was back in Los Angeles  when they issued the warrant  so what did they  extradite you  yeah oh my god  they extradited you 
[03:27:30]  but I literally  got arrested  with 1.12 million dollar bail  are you kidding me  no because  the state of Louisiana  you know  it was a case  the district attorney  was running  for district judge  I guess  and it was all like  how do they justify  because they're saying  I was a flight risk  because I was no longer  in the state  so there was this  principle to  second degree battery charge  for what the bouncers did  and they gave me  a principle to that  like I was somehow  an accessory to that  and with that charge  came a $120,000 bail 
[03:28:00]  and then separately  just for the one  stapled through my ball bag  I got a full million  the million dollar stable  yeah  a million dollar bail  they don't give that  to some people  that kill people  I know  I don't think  Robert Blake  yeah  I think he only  had a million  and I didn't  I didn't  you know  I had no way  of posting that  kind of bail  you can't post  that kind of bond  so yeah  so I was sitting  on Robert Downey Jr. block  in LA County Jail  for five days 
[03:28:30]  five days  you had to sit there  because they had  a million dollar bond  yeah  and you know  we had to wait  to get me  in front of a judge  to have a bail  reduction hearing  to say look  this guy's not a flight risk  he can't hide anywhere  yeah you know  can't hide  yeah  he's got a penis tattoo  on his own  for God's sake  how are you going  to miss this guy  so we got it on  that's not the type  of tattoo you want  if you're in the joint  you might want  to cover that up  if you're going  to be in the joint  you want a matching  one in your mouth 
[03:29:00]  son  yeah sure  but yeah  we got it down  we got it knocked  down to 150,000  and my accountant  put that up  that should have  just been released  on his own  recognizance  what justifies  any bail  when all you've done  is put a staple  through your sack  I know  god damn  and I'm not sure  if I can get girls  pregnant after all  the staples  that have been  through my ball sack  but I can damn  well fuck them  good you don't want 
[03:29:30]  to ruin that girl's  body with a baby  yeah exactly  geez  hey what's up  with this new DVD  I'm so proud of it man  it's called  Steve-O the Early Years  and it's  how dangerous  and irresponsible  behavior can lead  to fame and fortune  there you go kids  you're teaching them  it's basically  a how to video  like I would take  a video camera  and like piss  a lot of people off  I mean I don't know  I like to describe it  as a two opera  TV A&E biography 
[03:30:00]  about the rise  and the rise  to shame  so far the rise  the rise of Steve-O  what's the craziest  thing on here  I don't know man  there's a lot of  early footage  I mean you're  jumping off the  roofs  that's pretty crazy  yeah I mean  the fire stuff  you did  was unbelievable  it's loaded  it's loaded  with stunts man  and you know  like a lot of  people just ask me  so much  they'll say  how'd you get  into all this  you know  like how'd you  get your start  and so finally  I just put together 
[03:30:30]  a damn video  that tells the story  there's the start  you know  like to be honest  like  I mean it's a change  of pace  for my other videos  which are  just kind of  non-stop mayhem  but  can you get  this in stores  yeah absolutely  man it's only  $9.99  at Best Buy  $9.99  for the Steve-O  DVD  I don't know  what it is  it's really  pissing me off  but DVD prices  are going way down  yeah  when you finally  start putting them  out right  yeah and what's  up with this  satellite radio  business  no commercials  there  does that mean  oh yeah  we can just hang  we can hang  curse  do whatever 
[03:31:00]  yes  no we can  take a break  so we can regroup  because we want  you to do  some stuff today  yeah I want  to smoke a cigarette  like we're allowed  to do that right  if we're allowed  to say fuck  I think you can  smoke a cigarette  yeah why not  unless there's  a howlon system  in here  that'll go off  oh which  that  no we'll be fine  no that's just  a water thing  if that sprinkler  goes off  I will laugh  myself  I will laugh  my balls  I don't think  they have howlon  I'm so proud 
[03:31:30]  of all these arrests  I've had  since I saw you last  what about the rest  of your partner  there Chris  oh yeah  because they just  handed this to me  as well  yeah that was  brilliant  he was found  completely butt naked  passed out on the  roof of a parked  SUV on 10th Street  in South Beach  great  in Miami  and what led up  to that  a lot of drinking  he says that  somebody drugged him  but I'm telling you  it was him  and me  somebody drugged him  yeah he did 
[03:32:00]  he drugged himself  and then he yelled  and screamed at the cops  and then they pepper  sprayed him  oh pepper spray  no no he did not  cooperate whatsoever  he actually threatened  his quote is  I'm gonna kick  your posterior  yeah yeah yeah  totally  that was in the  he just didn't feel  like saying ass  did he laugh  at the pepper spray  considering all the  other stuff  that he's done  yeah  no and then  pepper spray  is nothing to laugh  at man  no huh  have you ever been  pepper spray  I did a stunt  called Tabasco  eye drops  which  I had a really 
[03:32:30]  hard time  with that one  well we've seen  you snort  the wasabi  right  I'd rather  snort wasabi  before Tabasco  eye drops  again  one of the funniest  parts of Jackass  the movie  is the electrodes  and they put the  electrodes on  everybody  and they're all  tightening up  and they put them  on the ball stack  because you see  all the commercials  on TV for those  things and you  really get the  impression that  it's for like  kind of like  fat ladies  yeah  like you know  exercise  try to tone the 
[03:33:00]  muscles by making  them move  through electricity  instead of moving  them yourself  you know what  the sickest stunt  in the Jackass  movie was  and it was such  a simple one  the paper cuts  oh shit  the paper cuts  yeah  I can't even  think about it  don't make me  think about it  it was pretty much  the most simple  simple one but I mean  oh the corners of  your mouth  oh  I had one on my  nose that didn't  make the cut  oh really  that was  that's the one  that just made me  just cringe in the  movie theater 
[03:33:30]  yeah I was  right between  just imagine the  look everyone's  just getting  all creeped out  I can't even  think about it  you know  I think for that  movie I'm most  proud of the  ceiling fan  oh the ceiling fan  great  I remember telling  our director  I was like  dude I want to  get a vaulting  I want a vaulting  trampoline and I  want to take out  my ceiling fan  while it's at  full speed  our director  I like that  I like that  let me show up  the cameras  good one  are you guys  going to make  another movie  not jackass 
[03:34:00]  jackass we  certainly wouldn't  do without  Knoxville  but that's not  to say that this  boy is going to  get any smarter  yeah Johnny doesn't  have to do any of  that stuff anymore  it's amazing  yeah but his  personal life has  always been so  much more reckless  than  yeah  oh yeah he's  awesome  he just rules  why don't we take a  break  alright  these are real  quick breaks  that we take  by the way  yeah it's just  four minutes  so you can't  even sleep  anybody pot  I swallowed some  but I'm not  supposed to shit

[03:41:30]  I would hit that button  you might not be  inclined to do it  and if I thought it  and you didn't  people wouldn't get  the enjoyment  of knowing that  there's a short person  walking into the studio  or how about this  whenever it's time  to use the button  I'll just yell  hit the mini me clip  hit the mini me clip  someone  yeah  can I have it too  at least  I have no problem  with you also having it  I think you should share  why did you want  exclusivity  that's what I don't understand  it's too good  it is very good 
[03:42:00]  it's so good  it needs to be  on both machines  you got all the fun  shut up ones  you have shut up ones  I don't think  I have shut up ones  I don't have any  I don't feel bad  for either one of you  tools  you're supposed to  give me the new  shut up one  tomorrow  shut up  shut the fuck  you have no right  to take  shut up  shut up  shut up  shut  shut  shut  shut  shut up  shut up  by the way  I love that one  by the way  proving that you were  asleep at the wheel today  why  we could have used  that clip at least 
[03:42:30]  20 times today  I like your approach  better  see I would sit back  sometimes  and not even do that  I like the subtle  approach on that  whole thing  so you think it's  subtle is better  at times  see I wasn't  stepping on you  I thought that worked  quite nicely  so we got  who's here  Sabrina  Sikora  wow  nice  where are you going  Chris Rush  in the studio  where are you going 
[03:43:00]  I'm just saying  I gotta leave soon  no one would ever  say that to your face  yes they would  they'd call in  hi you suck  shut up  that's when I wanted  to shut up  shut up  shut up  shut up  shut up  shut up  shut up  you really believed  that my approach  was better  are you insane  Pete from Astoria  I was born in Astoria  Pete  now all Greek there 
[03:43:30]  Pete  Pete what's up  what's fine guys  hi Pete  how's everybody  doing this morning  imagine if his  last name was Moss  I don't know if  it sounds like  to anyone else  but it sounded like  he was having sex  in that clip  I'm alright  I'm alright  I'm alright  ah  no what happened  was he was  wait where is it  I want to play it now  the mini meat clip  it sounds like  he's having sex  I don't know  what it sounds like  actually  he's laying in the bed  drunk  and Christopher Knight  is comforting him  instead of just 
[03:44:00]  biting his arm  and chest  like he should  be a little  fat piece of Play-Doh  little oven  stuffer roaster  body  that's exactly  what he looks like  a Cornish game hen  should be gutted  and fed to people  he's sitting around  drinking  waiting for Mike  Myers next phone call  you gotta see  there's a scene  where he's sitting  on a ledge  and him and  Christopher Knight  are drinking  and he actually  takes  he gets drunk  and he falls back  and kind of  almost passes out  but he's such  a little nothing  that he's like 
[03:44:30]  there's no  there's no bending  it's like he all  just falls back  at once  it's like  it's like a  Stonehenge  type of thing  just falls back  at once  just one piece  like a weevil  no joints on him  no  you just  you want to  just pick him up  by the legs  and pull the last  30 seconds of Caligula  out  and smash his face  on the steps  he's like </pre>
