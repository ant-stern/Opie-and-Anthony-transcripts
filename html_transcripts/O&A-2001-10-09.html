<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, originating from Las Vegas, covered a wide range of topics in a highly irreverent and often offensive manner. The show began with listener calls regarding the upcoming 100th syndicated show in Philadelphia, including difficulties with ticket distribution and criticism of program director Tim Sabian.  The Philadelphia lineup was discussed, featuring Stephen Lynch, Jim Norton, a local cover band, and possibly fire-breathing twins.  A segment on a "splooge guy" selling flavorings for sexual fluids was followed by discussion of a planned Stars and Stripes bikini contest with a $1000 prize.  A listener then recounted a bizarre experience listening to the show during a memorial service, prompting a debate on the show’s accessibility to new listeners and a reminiscence about a previous roadshow incident involving vulgar acts.  This was followed by a heated exchange with an 11-year-old caller, Gary, involving numerous insults and offensive language from both sides.

The show then shifted to a discussion of anthrax found in a Florida building housing American Media, Inc., and a reported reconciliation between Andrew Dice Clay and Jay Moore, whose feud had made the National Enquirer.  Studio guest Stephen Lynch performed songs, including "FBA," a vulgar track co-written with Jay Moore and Mike D. Nicola, who joined for a spoken-word segment.  The hosts discussed "Stalker Patty," a female listener who repeatedly disrupted the show.  Further listener calls covered poor reception in San Francisco, negative comedy club experiences, and humorous anecdotes.  The hosts then launched into insensitive and offensive jokes about the war in Afghanistan, interspersed with more listener calls, a prank call using *Full Metal Jacket* audio, and a song for a show employee, "Stinky."  The ongoing conflict over Philadelphia show ticket distribution and interactions with Tim Sabian were revisited.

Comedian Jim Gaffigan was a studio guest, participating in a rambling discussion about various topics including New York City hotspots, stock tips, and – repeatedly –  offensive jokes about the war in Afghanistan, targeting various countries, nationalities, and leaders such as George W. Bush and Tony Blair.  The conversation included sexually explicit humor and numerous vulgar jokes.  Calls from listeners and Jeff Probst (host of *Survivor*) were interspersed, with Probst focusing on the upcoming African season of his show, while maintaining the overall tone of sexually suggestive and offensive humor.  The conversation included mentions of Gaffigan's appearances on *Ellen* and Caroline's.  The hosts also spent time promoting O2 Go, an oxygenated water product.  The show included discussion of their tenth Vegas show, contrasting it with the Philadelphia milestone, and an anecdote about employee Pete Johnson falling asleep after eating hash brownies.  Upcoming shows in Boston (Halloween) were also mentioned.  The show concluded with a segment where callers shared their takeaways from the broadcast, leading to a series of vulgar and nonsensical statements, along with listener feedback maintaining the irreverent tone.  The hosts repeatedly plugged Stephen Lynch's upcoming performances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show, a couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else including Las Vegas, yes, day two in Vegas, day two in Vegas, 866-277-4WOW, that's 866-277-4WOW, we'll start with the Vegas call today, Bob, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, man?  All right, man.  Hey, I was calling you guys, I listened yesterday, man, I didn't really care for the show too much. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, hold on, you listened to the show yesterday and you didn't care for it?  Yeah, well, my brother...  So, wait, wait, why are you listening today?  Because, again, I've been talking to him, like, and he's telling me about this show, and I was like, you know, talk shows, but like, so my brother said, you guys are freaking hilarious, dude.  But we weren't yesterday, huh?  Well, it was alright, there was parts, man, there was parts that were really good, but...  Like, what was funny yesterday?  Oh, uh, the, um...  The stuff you were doing with, uh, Snoop and stuff, I thought that was pretty funny, and that little kid that called in. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  Gary, yeah?  Yeah.  But that's...  Having those other girls on, man, that really slowed it down.  Hmm.  Which girls?  Retarded Laverne and Shirley?  Yeah.  Or Patty?  All of them, man.  Yeah.  You'll learn to love the Retarded Laverne and Shirley, my friend.  Yeah.  In the we-hate-them kind of way.  Yeah.  Right on.  And they're not girls, sir, they're water buffalo.  Beasts.  Beasts.  Now, you gotta give the show time.  We've only been in town, what, one day so far. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I'm definitely gonna give you guys time.  Like I said, my brother said you guys are hilarious.  I mean, I'm definitely gonna listen.  You know, you'll tune in and hear maybe the Retarded Laverne and Shirley after you get  to know some of the people involved with the show after a while and go, oh, these twats.  You know?  Yeah, my brother told me to listen for at least a week, and if I didn't like them, stop listening.  Yeah, it takes time, because you gotta know all the characters, and we don't really have  time to introduce them to you, sir.  Yeah.  So you just gotta kind of get into it.  So you gotta kind of figure it out on your own, all right?  I hear you guys. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  All right, ma'am.  Thank you, Bob.  All right, Mike.  All right, Bob, who doesn't like us, but he's listening today.  Actually sound a little more open-minded than some of the callers in other cities that  we got on day two.  He said I didn't care for it.  He didn't say you suck.  He didn't care for it.  Not you suck, die.  Yeah.  Like Philly did to us.  Thanks, Philly.  Thank you, Philly.  Ah, Young Buck, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, what's up?  I have a question about the Philly show.  Is it still you gotta win these tickets on the radio, or can you just get them?  Yeah, you can thank Tim Sabian down at WISP for doing it that way.  It's hard, but I mean, you're like, he's a bully, you know? 
[00:02:30]  I think he's a control freak.  I don't know what is he's up.  I want to give a special hello, too.  Wait, wait, Young Buck, he's got all the tickets, and he's dishing them out one at a time.  Yeah, dude, it's great.  You're eighth caller.  You don't get to see ONA, you know?  Like he's doing everyone a favor.  Right.  We gotta talk.  We've always had tradition for roadshows where everybody just shows up and gets nuts, you  know?  Yeah.  If they can't make it in, you know, you're SOL, and you catch the next one.  I personally like an open-door policy for our roadshows, because that means the real  hardcore people will get in.  They'll get in.  They're there first. 
[00:03:00]  They know.  We've had listeners wait four or five hours just to get in, but Tim Sabian, he's in control  of the tickets.  And he'll probably give it to all guys.  Yeah, we need some women at our roadshow down at Sully's.  It's horrible.  You got these people calling the show.  They're not even like, some of them aren't even like dedicated fans.  Oh, boy.  See, that's what we don't want.  Yeah, don't freak us out with that.  Yeah.  We're assuming everyone that's winning the tickets are, you know, are psyched about the  show.  Big fans.  All right?  Hopefully.  Yeah, a special hello to the Don Rickles of age jokes.  Jim Norton. 
[00:03:30]  What's up, man?  Jim Norton, man.  Hey, Young Buck, you got tickets for the show?  No, I don't, man.  I really don't.  It's really annoying.  All right.  Can I give them away or what?  Yeah, you can.  All right.  Hold on, Young Buck.  All right.  He's telling you you can.  What the hell?  I don't care.  Yee.  But just in case anyone else is going to, you know, work us today, we only have one  more pair to give away.  Right.  So don't even try.  So we'll just give them away somehow today.  At will.  It happens a week from tomorrow.  We're going down to Philly.  You went over Tim Sabian's head giving those tickets away.  I don't know how pissed he's going to be.  No, he gave us, I think, 10 pairs to give away. 
[00:04:00]  Thanks, Tim.  Here's Tim pissed.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm so pissed off, guys.  The guy's like Mr. Happy, like he's on crystal meth or something all the time.  I think he's giving us a pair a day to give away.  Woo.  He's in control, Jim.  He's got to be in control of our tickets.  And Tim Sabian's really on the ball, huh?  You know what I bet?  I bet we walk into the place, it's full of salespeople.  Like, hey, I gave the tickets out as a sales incentive.  You know how many advertisers and their stupid friends are going to be there? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, I'm sure.  I don't listen.  I love your show.  Not your show, but the genre.  Thanks.  Dude, that's right.  I didn't even think of that.  You know, Tim's probably calling in favors with broadcasting people and advertising people,  sponsors.  I'll get your tickets.  Don't worry.  So it's going to be a bunch of stuffed shirt stiffs and our usual crowd of criminals will  be left outside.  Let's get the happy-go-lucky Tim Sabian on the line.  Where is he?  We've got to make sure he's not undermining this event. 
[00:05:00]  We're very excited.  A week from tomorrow, we will be down in Philly the whole day.  We're getting on a train real early in the morning.  We're doing lunch with the sales staff at the radio station down there in Philly.  That's my highlight of this whole thing.  Screw the road show and broadcasting from YSP and hanging with the listeners.  That sales meeting, I can't wait.  I love sales meetings.  Just talk to them.  See how they do things, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I suggested that the listeners come to the radio station to hang with us.  And Tim was like, you know, Tim has to be in control. 
[00:05:30]  He's like, you shouldn't say that because too many people might show up at the station  and I don't know if we'll be able to control them.  Yeah.  God forbid a bunch of people that are really into the show show up.  No.  Keep them away.  Has Tim Sabian locked the door three times before going to bed?  This OCD psychopath?  Click, click, click, click, click.  He's got some hints of OCD in him.  Yeah.  Control freak.  So then we're doing lunch with the sales staff and hopefully with some of the listeners down  in Philly.  And then we're doing the radio show.  And then we're heading off to the electric factory for the hundredth show in syndication. 
[00:06:00]  Nice.  For Philadelphia.  They were the first station to come aboard.  And we got Days of the New Plane, Octane, which is a local cover band that I hear rocks.  Our own Stephen Lynch, who's coming in today, will be performing a few songs.  Jim Norton's going to do a set on stage, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Also, we have to see if we can do this.  I don't know.  We better ask Tim.  There's a local group that it's a fire-breathing twin chicks show. 
[00:06:30]  Book it.  We want to book it, but we've got to make sure it's okay with Tim.  Pass it by Tim.  Is Tim going to be at this event?  Yeah, we're going to go.  Aw, I just think of the crowd's reaction when he takes the stage and we introduce him.  Oh, they'll love him, I'm sure.  You know, we shouldn't run him too hard, though, because he has support of this show.  Yeah.  We wanted us on in Philadelphia about a year ago.  Shows how crazy he really is.  Where is he?  I want to bust his balls today.  Yeah, what the hell?  Message.  Message?  He cannot possibly have anything more important than us. 
[00:07:00]  We met his splooge guy, too.  We've got to talk about that.  What?  Oh, the splooge guy.  I took that a little different when you said we met his splooge guy.  We met.  I thought he was living what they call the alternative lifestyle.  We met his splooge guy.  It was the guy, his friend, that has the product that flavors various sexual byproducts of males and females to taste like fruit.  Norton, you pop a few of these pills and you're, you know what, tastes lemony.  Yeah.  Tastes fruity. 
[00:07:30]  All of a sudden, she can't complain that she doesn't like the taste.  I don't like that, though.  I like the bad taste humiliation factor.  You like when they make that face like they just bit into a lemon?  Yeah, old bleach breath.  Oh, God.  Smells like bleach.  So we got some fire-breathing twin chick thing that we're hoping to do at the Electric Factory a week from Wednesday when we do the road show.  And this is the grand finale.  We're going to do a Stars and Stripes bikini contest with one lucky lady from the Philadelphia area walking away with $1,000 cash. 
[00:08:00]  They actually came up with the grand.  And we're going to even supply the bathing suits.  Oh, really?  So, ladies, you just got to show up.  If you got your own, that would help.  Probably be a little easier to win if you have your own because then you can make it as small as possible.  So, yeah, if you want in on the contest, ladies, show up with your Stars and Stripes bikini.  All right?  Because we're just going to announce it to the crowd and then you come to the side of the stage.  We'll sign you up.  Then we'll parade your flesh all over the stage and then we'll figure out who won. 
[00:08:30]  Okay?  There you go.  Grand.  So we cannot wait.  A week from tomorrow, it's going to be a great day for the Opie and Anthony show.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I just want to know, I want to tell you that yesterday's show was awesome.  Wow.  I was on my way to a memorial service for someone that died in the Trade Center and it just took  all my problems away and brought them to your radio station.  It was a very strange show yesterday.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  Thanks.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm glad you liked it, bro. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Uncle John.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  All right.  Hey, I got a little advice as a longtime listener for your New Vegas people.  You got to listen to the show for about 20 minutes.  And if you're not laughing, you probably have the wrong channel.  Well, we're up to 25 minutes already.  25 minutes.  That's Rick's take on the whole thing as per his television interview.  Right after I get on the show and they're interviewing me and I say, the show's like a soap opera because  the person on this thing, I think it was Fox News. 
[00:09:30]  Was it Fox?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fox News said, what is it about your show?  You know, what would you tell listeners that are just tuning in?  And I say, it takes a while.  It's like a soap opera.  You know, you got to get to know the characters and whatnot.  And it could take, you know, a few weeks for you to know exactly who we're talking about.  We can't explain everybody to everybody in New Cities.  Then they go right to Rick.  And Rick goes, about the show, if you're not laughing in the first 20 minutes, you got  the wrong station.  Like, completely contradicts what I just said.  I got the clip.  Here it is. 
[00:10:00]  Rick on Fox.  Hold on, hold on.  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex.  No.  Listen to the show.  And if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've got the wrong  station.  I don't know.  Right after I said, it takes a while.  He just undermines it.  If you're not listening, if you're not laughing in 20 minutes, then, then, then what?  Then, then.  And I don't know.  Then you buy something else.  Hey, Jed, what's going on?  Not much.  Just hanging out here in Vegas. 
[00:10:30]  I enjoyed it.  You're enjoying the show so far?  Yeah, you better believe it.  We've just begun, my friend.  Hey, you know, I really love the one that kid called that chick fatso.  I mean, that's just classic, man.  Best use of the word fatso.  You better believe it.  Jed, huh?  I got a question for you, though.  Do you guys get Vinny from Queens calling in at all?  Vinny from Queens?  He calls into that, uh...  Isn't he the, uh...  What's that?  We have a lot of Vinny from Queens calling the show.  Why?  Oh, when I lived back there, I used to listen to, uh, the sports talk station out there. 
[00:11:00]  640, was it?  Oh, the fan.  Yeah, the fan.  Mike and the Mad Dog Show on the fan.  Yeah, we got Vinny from...  That's it.  Mike and the Mad Dog Show.  Christopher Russo.  Anyway, this guy, he'd call in Vinny from Queens, and he acted as if he was the freaking  general manager of every team in the entire...  Right.  Well, that's how the sports stations call it.  I've got a trade for you.  I've got a trade for you.  All right, Jed.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you, sir.  All right.  No one cares anywhere else when you had to just...  Called up to say, uh, Liz used to listen to the sports station here in New York.  Great.  Thank you. 
[00:11:30]  Isaac, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, man?  I'm from Philly.  I just want you guys to know that, uh, people are really getting excited about this down here.  It's a word spread.  All my friends know they've been trying to get tickets.  So it's not just...  You know, he might be passing a ton.  I know how the radio thing works, but people are ready to put it down.  How is he giving away the tickets for the 100th show down there when we're not on the air?  You're just like, you know, during the regular programming, it's like, uh, call up and when,  you know, if you're there, call or whatever.  That's kind of shady because sometimes you get people that just call a radio station just  because they hear the number. 
[00:12:00]  That's the worst way, and I'll tell you why, because there's a bunch of concert pigs.  They don't know why they're calling.  They just hear, call now.  Like, oh my God, I got a call.  Oh my God, they got a call.  But a lot of people are like, did I win the O&A tickets?  Did I win the O&A tickets?  And they're like, yeah.  And they're really excited.  So you can tell people are listening.  We just want the hardcore fans there.  Well, you're probably going to get more, but the Electric Factory is a big place.  Not some fat lady from the suburbs that thought she was winning the Godfather DVD,  and instead she's getting tickets for the O&A Roadshow.  Right.  What is this?  Tell us a little more about the Roadshow after I'm going because I want to hear. 
[00:12:30]  I've never even been to one, but I've been listening to you guys since you came to Philly.  I've just been crying every day.  So keep up the good work.  We've upped the ante by getting real bands this time.  Right.  So we got real bands.  I'm really excited to hear your stat, man.  So good luck.  I'll see you guys later.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  We'll see you a week from Wednesday, bro.  Peace.  Peace.  And then just the onstage debauchery that takes place.  Usually there's some real pistols, some winners in the crowd, Norton, that we bring up on stage.  And they could do their thing up there. 
[00:13:00]  And that's one of the unexpected things that usually happens.  It usually involves some orifice and various products.  I'm assuming we'll get a bunch of girls up on the stage to pass.  You know.  I don't doubt it.  Too bad Mendy won't be there for people that didn't know her.  Mendy went to Florida, I guess.  Hopefully she's working in American media.  Oh!  Wow.  She never did anything to you.  It is a livestock disease originally. 
[00:13:30]  You never know.  She really is.  For those that don't know her, she's a big fat girl.  And she would do things, like they said, with orifices.  Picture a pogo stick being jammed in and out of a blowhole.  Right.  Just repugnant.  She did the most amazing thing I've ever seen on a stage, though.  Human beer cozy.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Made a beer can disappear in the front door.  Then a guest that was there at the road show crept right up and popped the beer. 
[00:14:00]  And it spewed into his face, the beer.  And it looked like, if you watched it from the side, it looked like the old cowboy was a little too close to the rear of the mayor.  You know what I mean?  It just flew out at him.  But she's in Florida now.  And when the, I don't know if you remember when the beer came out.  Like it went in until it comes back out.  Yeah.  You ever hear the sound a fruit roll-up makes when you peel it off the paper?  Yeah.  Just that awful, moist, yet dry sound. 
[00:14:30]  But there is comparable, disgusting stuff that takes place at these road shows.  Very entertaining, fun to watch things.  Remember the old woman?  We got a mother-daughter team once.  We've had it all.  It was the mother-daughter, some kind of contest was going on.  Was it a, do I remember them in diapers or something?  Oh, no, no.  It was the homemade bikini contest.  Homemade bikini contest.  The mother-daughter team.  Oh, my God.  Just, this old woman gets up and just starts taking her homemade bikini, which was, I think, paper in a sheet or something. 
[00:15:00]  She ended up winning, though.  Yeah, you know, because the crowd is a bunch of asses.  And what did you think of this one?  Woo!  Yeah, there's the hot chick going, wait a minute.  Come on.  I spent all afternoon on mine.  Yeah, we'll weed those out.  It was funny.  How awful.  Maybe a fat girl could show up.  We could just smack and whip her back.  I like that.  I'd be in.  Simon, what's going on?  Hi there, gentlemen.  I just want to let everybody in Vegas know. 
[00:15:30]  I am a stereotypical English guy living in Philadelphia.  I, you know, pull up my butt, as people would say here.  Hey, Simon, how many times did you get beat up because of your voice growing up?  Because of my voice?  Yeah.  No, I got beat up for other things.  Being ginger, having freckles.  That sort of thing.  Freckles.  Freckles.  Freckles.  Being ginger.  What's that?  Being ginger.  What's being ginger mean?  Ginger.  Red hair ginger.  Ah, ginger.  People beat you up because you had red hair. 
[00:16:00]  It's just a kid thing.  Yeah.  And chicks don't really like it either.  All right.  So what do you want to say to Vegas?  I just want to let Vegas know.  I've been in the States for just over a year, and for the last two months I've worked with  a guy who just put me on to you guys, and it's the best thing I've ever heard.  All right.  I'm almost divorced now after trying to talk my wife into balloon knotting.  Right.  Balloon knotting.  I never heard it called balloon knot.  Balloon knotting.  That's nice. 
[00:16:30]  I like that.  Hey, Simon, how long have you been in this country?  In this country?  About 16 months now.  Yeah?  Well, I've got to tell you, God bless England.  I love the England's with us.  England's with us through anything.  Great ally.  We could say, you know something, we're going to take over Canada.  England's all right, we're with you.  It's all right then.  Tony Blair, you've got to love him.  Hey, I don't know if you heard his speech the other day when he said, you know, basically  it's going off, we're with you, which everybody really agrees with.  You know what?  I've got an analogy about England and America. 
[00:17:00]  It turns out like England was the older brother of America that used to beat us up all the  time.  As time went on, the younger brother ended up getting bigger and stronger than the older  brother.  But instead of fighting, now if anyone screws with either of them, we'll just both go after  him and kick ass.  And it's a great alliance between England and the United States.  Plus, there's also the benefit of the, wasn't there a cutting off Elton John's records? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, thanks for that.  Thanks for Elton.  People were asking me why.  You guys could have Elton John back.  Yeah, take Elton back, could you please?  Well, people were asking me why they stopped playing Elton John's records.  And there's a myth going around that apparently, you know, they heard that he was involved with  a load of guys in a mass bombing, but they didn't realize the O got mistaken for the  U.  I'm just waiting.  I got you.  A mass bombing.  I like that.  I'm just waiting for his latest version of Candle in the Wind to come out.  Oh, please. 
[00:18:00]  God, man.  You know it's on the way.  He's already done three versions of that song.  He's a bit ginger.  He is.  He's a total.  He's a balloon notter extreme.  Balloon notter.  All right, Simon.  Look, guys, I know people ask.  We're desperate for tickets down here.  Where can we get them?  Melissa's doing like a ticket rate.  Is she doing one today?  Hold on.  Let me get Melissa on the line here.  Thank you so much.  Melissa.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You hot piece of ass.  What's up?  Hey, who said that?  Jim Norton.  Sorry.  I've been listening to what you guys are saying, and I wanted to let people know that wherever 
[00:18:30]  I am, I have O&A tickets on me, and I'm going to be doing these big ticket rates.  Do I have to search for them?  Yeah, how about that?  They're on me somewhere.  You don't want to say that, Melissa.  You know, I can't say anything.  I'm never safe with you guys.  Are you giving them to women, Melissa?  You're not giving them to just well-muscled hunks, are you?  Are you giving them to women?  Well, put it this way.  There's a place called Cheerleaders down here, and we have to go there and kind of hand them  out all over the place, and all the people that work there want them, which are beautiful 
[00:19:00]  women.  But you're handing them to people that want to go to this show, right?  Of course.  They're killing me for them.  I actually don't have enough.  I have to get more.  Just make sure they want them, because there's so many people that are going to be shut out of this  show next Wednesday, all right?  I know.  Everybody wants them, and we've got them to give out.  I'm starting on Thursday.  I'm going to all these different locations.  We'll be announcing them on the air.  Okay.  And I've got them with me up in New York.  I'm coming up there now to do an appearance up there, and I'll have them up there to give  to some people, too.  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  All right.  Simon, just keep listening to the station, and they'll tell you where they're going to 
[00:19:30]  be, all right?  Okay.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You're the best.  Spam looker.  Bye.  Later.  Bye.  Balloon nodding sounds nice when he says it.  Balloon nodding.  Part of your trip, you go kayaking and balloon nodding.  It just sounds nice.  Balloon nodding.  We're going to do some balloon nodding if the weather's right.  Hey, Keith, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I was over at the Asbury Park, so I was just wondering, you think you guys are going to  have the same sort of legal problems you had there?  You know, between the lesbians and the beer and everything?  No, we're going to be just fine. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  A little warning to the electric factory.  I hope you have enough beer.  Yeah.  Beer is very important.  Make sure you have plenty of it.  The last road show we did in Jersey, we ran out of beer.  They started serving warm beer, I think.  It's funny he brings up the Asbury Park thing, because I was looking at pictures of Asbury  Park, and for the first, like, ten minutes, I thought I was looking at damage assessment  from Afghanistan, from the bombing raid.  And then I saw a wow banner and realized, oh, that was our appearance at Asbury Park.  Silly me.  It is an awful place. 
[00:20:30]  Awful.  I thought we were doing a great job bombing Afghanistan.  I saw craters, burnt-out buildings.  It was great.  And if Mike's Lemonade is going to be part of this road show, please bring more than  three cases.  And don't get mad at us for liking your product.  Yeah, they got mad at us because we bitched on the air that they ran out of Mike's Hard  Lemonade or whatever.  Yeah, we get one of our sales guys comes over to us and goes, hey, you know, Mike's was a  little pissed that you were talking badly about the product.  We said, what?  We never talk badly about Mike's.  We all drink it. 
[00:21:00]  And they didn't bring enough of it to the road show.  It does not say that it was really being received well.  Norton, they brought maybe ten cases.  Ten cases.  We had a good one for a few thousand people.  We don't have a sip.  We had between two and three thousand people there.  Hot summer day.  And they bring ten cases.  Then we bitch about it on the air.  And we're the bad guys.  Well, a sales guy wouldn't tell it wrong.  I mean, if he said something, it's a certain way.  That's the way it is.  Was everyone drinking it or were we using it to disinfect gunshot wounds of the local  residents?  Because that might have made it run out a little quicker. 
[00:21:30]  That Asbury Park's a rough area.  Oh, it stinks.  Welcome to Asbury Park.  Greetings.  Awful.  Oh, man.  Dan from Hoboken saying between Simon and Snoop Dogg, he's learning.  More vocabulary today than his word of the day calendar.  Very good.  Glenn, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, boys.  What time do I show up at YSP next Wednesday?  Well, we'll be there around 11, 1130.  Just in time to have lunch with the sales staff. 
[00:22:00]  Is that what time the lunch is?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll make sure I'm down there then.  We'll make sure we save you some lunch.  Oh, yeah?  What are they serving?  Tim keeps telling us, don't announce, you know, that you're going to be at the station.  We can't handle the crowd that may show up.  Please.  I want to be in this meeting with the sales people, look out the window, and have it look  like one of those anti-American demonstrations outside.  That's what I want to see for the crowd.  Because I want to stay in that meeting with sales for as little time as possible. 
[00:22:30]  All right, Glenn?  We'll sit down there, okay?  Yeah, that's a tight area.  That's going to be a tough spot.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  All right, cool.  Cool.  Get a spot now.  That's going to be an awful meeting.  Because you know how people try to quote what you did?  Like, hey, I remember I like that part.  And they really don't.  They just stink up the room with it.  That's going to really get away.  Hey, that puddle of AIDS thing that you...  Yeah, did the guy fall or did he slip?  I don't quite remember.  Because how slippery is the AIDS virus?  Yeah, me and my friend were out having a beer. 
[00:23:00]  Oak calls him on it all the time, too.  Because some salespeople go in and go,  Oh, last week, oh, my God, I was driving home laughing my ass off.  And Oak will say, hey, what were you laughing at?  Oh, it was that thing.  Okay, I'm just trying to kiss your ass to get a better spot.  To get my client pitched better on your program.  Exactly.  All right, here we go.  On the show today, we've got Stephen Lynch coming in.  He finally woke up from the Jay Moore tribute.  Really?  Tribute. 
[00:23:30]  Jay Moore's tribute.  What a...  Jay Moore's benefit.  It's a benefit show, sure.  Make it sound like Jay's not around anymore.  The Jay Moore tribute.  Jay Moore, did the dice kill him?  No, he's fine.  The dice story made the National Enquirer, though.  Yeah.  We can talk about that next really fast.  Well, I think those people got worse things to worry about down there.  So, Stephen Lynch coming in to do a new song and some oldies, but goodies.  Jeff Probst calling in.  He was supposed to be here, but he's scared to fly.  This is the guy that hung out of the helicopter door on the last episode of Survivor last season. 
[00:24:00]  He's hanging out the helicopter door all brave.  He's not ready to fly yet.  Girl.  A very funny guy, Jim Gaffigan, coming in.  Yes.  Last time he was on this show, though, we abused him bad.  Well, Dice was in last time, and Jim wasn't able to get a word in edgewise.  Gaffigan's funny, man.  Who's the clean-cut guy?  You know, and Jim's just kind of a quiet...  But then we apologized and said, well, call us, like, tomorrow, and he calls, and then  we play the silent game with him. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, I forgot about that.  Oh, I didn't think you did that.  And then, also, Darian Cain's coming in with a lesbian friend to do some stuff.  So, she's a porn star?  Yeah.  Of sorts?  Yes.  Is she pretty?  Yes.  She's very nice.  As we go to break, a lot of people are talking about 11-year-old Gary making fun of the  retarded Laverne and Shirley.  We put a little highlight piece together, because I think it went on for, like, 20 minutes  yesterday.  But here's...  This kid is 11 years old.  God bless him.  11-year-old Gary, what's up?  What is up?  What is up? 
[00:25:00]  I just wanted to say, Morden, I worship you.  Thanks, buddy.  All I want to say is, when I get into a car accident, I just want to say to the driver,  I hope you jump into a pool of acid.  Nice.  Nice.  There you go.  All right.  I just wanted to say, is the retarded Laverne and Shirley in there?  No.  You want to talk to the retarded Laverne and Shirley real fast?  I just want to diss him.  You want to diss him?  Yeah.  That could be fun.  All right.  You know Gary?  Gary who?  This is 11-year-old Gary.  Gary who?  Hi, Gary.  Hey, fat coals. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Gary.  I heard you on a phony.  I heard you the other day.  You were like an 11-year-old brat that called in.  I heard you.  On Friday, I heard you.  He's only 11 years old.  He's like a little brat.  My son is 11 years old.  And your point is?  And my point is?  My son is 11 years old.  Where's your parents?  There's some surgery on your cellulite butt.  Where's your parents?  What?  Where's your mother and father?  Why?  They should smack you upside your head because you sound like a little brat. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  That's so...  Right, guess?  That's not nice.  A little twerp.  I don't care if it's nice.  You sound like a little twerp.  Yeah, you little brat.  That's so rich.  Both of your mamas are so stupid and fat.  When they went to a train station, they saw a train and they said, mmm, Snickers bar.  They picked it up and ate it.  Hey, you're a little brat.  Don't talk about mothers.  Because you know what?  I can talk about your mother. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, sure.  And I can say one thing right now.  I can say anything because you're a little brat.  You sound like a self-forcaster.  And you're a brat.  And somebody should kick you right up the nose.  Why don't you jump into a poor asset?  And you know what?  I guarantee you look the same way.  This is a kid that pulled in your show on Friday, I heard.  I wonder why your husband married you because I think he's just like vomiting in bed.  You have homework to do.  You know, he pulls a bucket out and goes up.  He doesn't do his homework.  Do you go to school? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you what.  What school do you go to?  People in school, she'll be smacking you upside your little bratty head.  All right, brat.  You little brat.  I'm smoking, fatso.  Bye.  See, fatso.  Vehicule the grass.  Marianne, this 11-year-old kid is giving you the business.  What do you want me to do?  Curse this little kid out?  I can't curse him out on the radio.  Well, don't curse him out.  You can't.  You know what I mean?  You can't curse me out.  I dare you. 
[00:27:30]  I don't have a curse on the radio, you little brat.  I don't think you're a little kid.  Right?  That's all they got.  No, I didn't.  What did they say?  What did they say?  I couldn't tell.  She has a mush mouth.  Marianne.  Yeah.  Oh, and I just wanted to say, Marianne, you can become Helen Keller soon.  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  No one wants to hear a stupid-ass voice.  Nobody, nobody, you shouldn't be on the radio with these guys anyway.  You're a little too young. 
[00:28:00]  You're a little too young.  You're a little too young.  You're a little too young.  You're a little too young.  It is.  And always your parents.  Both working.  Maybe you're a little too young partying.  Listen.  I owe Anthony a beating.  So when I came down there and you said that, I will tell you.  Yeah, that's right.  He owes me a beating.  Hey, Marianne wants to spank you, Gary.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You should be spanked on a butt with a belt.  I do not want that fat in your hand going and friggin' slobbering me whole.  Where is your mother?  What are you going to be doing?  I do not want to punch me.  All the fat from my arm will come out and just swallow my head open. 
[00:28:30]  Listen to this, Ken.  Yeah, but he does raise a good point.  Marianne, and his point is.  Shut up, you stank.  Where did you learn your language at?  What are you home watching?  Your porno movies till we have 12 o'clock?  Yeah, do you do that?  Do you watch porno movies?  Hey.  I can't understand the jibber-jabber.  He sounds like a juvenile delinquent.  He's a good boy. 
[00:29:00]  He's a good boy.  Thank you, Gary.  All right, no problem, man.  Anytime.  I apologize.  Oh, stalker, Patty.  Yeah.  You put her in the chair and you pull the chair, she'll fall and maybe break eight of her legs.  All of her legs because she does have eight of them.  Bye, Gary.  All right.  See you, fat sirs.  See you, hope you, Anthony.  All right, thank you, Gary.  All right, see you, guys.  See you, bye-bye.  See you, bye-bye.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:29:30]  I want to thank Pete Johnson for fixing the board.  I'll fix the board.  I'm Pete Johnson.  I'll fix it.  He feels very important today.  What did he have to fix?  He had to change a light bulb.  I changed light bulbs.  I'm Pete Johnson.  He's happy when he can help us out, though.  What is he going to tell his hash brownie story on the air?  Someone brought in brownies.  And they were hash sheesh brownies.  Who knows the story?  Does Earl know the story?  Oh, Earl probably knows it, I'm sure. 
[00:30:00]  He knows all the gossip.  He's like the little gossip chick.  Get Earl.  Pete hasn't been the same since they yanked him out of that American Airlines cockpit the other day.  What a story that was.  But they say six guys and something got up and just wrestled that guy to the ground.  Was it five guys?  And just like the stewardess sees on this American Airlines flight, this 30-year-old guy runs toward the cockpit, lunges, kicks the door open, and grabs the pilot.  Says he thought the devil was flying the plane and it was going to fly into the Sears Tower. 
[00:30:30]  So one of the stewardesses, the pilot like hits him to get him out of the cockpit.  And one of the stewardesses starts yelling like, it's happening, it's happening, help us, help us.  Like here it is.  Here's that thing that happens.  And a few guys got up and just started wrapping him up in a blanket and getting a few shots in.  And they said the plane like did a little hiccup, kind of did a dive, went up after the pilot got control.  And then they just, the F-16s were on it like that. 
[00:31:00]  And it escorted it down to the airport.  But the stewardess going, here it is, here it is.  I knew it happened and it's happening, help us.  Just drown them when they go.  Who's the guy?  Who's the guy though that's on that plane that you were on that flight?  Yeah, man.  What'd you do?  Oh, nothing.  Nothing.  I cried like a little girl.  Yeah, yeah.  There's five guys that can now get off that plane, meet the press and go, yeah, man.  The guy jumped, I pounded him, I started punching him, wrapped him up. 
[00:31:30]  And then there's the guy that's just like, well, it all happened so fast.  You know, there's so many men.  That's justifiable homicide if ever I've heard it.  Oh, yeah.  Now you can just kill someone in the air.  It doesn't matter.  You want to kill someone?  He rushed the cockpit?  Kick his ass.  You want to kill somebody, buy them a ticket.  Get them on a plane.  You get on the plane with them.  You could then just grab him and kill him and go, hey, I saw him going for the cockpit,  man. 
[00:32:00]  This guy here saw him.  He was going for the plastic knife.  The second, just keep feeding him drinks so he's got to use the toilet by the cockpit.  And the second he gets up, he's got a knife.  You kill him.  There are five guys that can brag and there's about 95 guys going, well, I was about to dot,  dot, dot.  I was going to, I was going to get up, but I was too much of a pussy.  You know, the seatbelt light was on.  That's good.  We have to back up because now this hash brownie story is taking on a life of its own. 
[00:32:30]  The great Matt Devote.  Matt Devote.  Who used to spin two for Tuesday tunes for the fine classic rock station.  Listen to this voice being wasted in sales.  Matt.  Matt.  Ah, now he wants his voice on the air.  Matt, are you there?  He's there.  He's there.  Is he effing with us?  Matt, you messing with us?  Hello?  He'll call back.  All right, Matt, call back, please, so we can make fun of you, too.  Two for Tuesday.  Now, I guess the hash brownie story is legendary around here.  How long has Pete Johnson worked for this radio show? 
[00:33:00]  863 years.  Well over 30 years, right?  40.  It'll be 43 years in December.  And he's going to retire soon, I'm here.  I remember the first show out of N.E.W., dot, dot, dash, dot, dash, dash, dot, that, dash.  12 years of vacation time, right?  The great Matt Devote.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, guys, forgive me.  I'm on the world's worst cell phone, but when I heard this, I had to call you.  Yeah?  Don't let Pete Johnson deny this story, either.  Because he'll go around denying it.  This was our old studios on 3rd Avenue. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Some record company person, I believe, had dropped off a bag of weed or ash or something  to get it ready, to get this done.  A little plugola going on.  A little weed for spins.  You didn't hear that from me, though.  A little weed for a few stone spins.  You didn't hear that from me.  So anyway.  Who did he think he is?  Oedipus?  One of the...  Did you guys just have a secret room, too?  Was there cocaine on the turntables?  You turn it on, 33 and a third, and snort the spiral? 
[00:34:00]  Every rock station in the 80s was doing it.  Here comes Pete Johnson.  All right, Pete Johnson's in the studio.  Somebody took it home and cooked up a batch, and in Pete's defense, he didn't know that  the brownies had that in it.  But they left the half-eaten tray.  They left the half-eaten tray there.  All right, so I'm about 12 years old when that happened.  Ooh.  He's abusing you, Matt. 
[00:34:30]  He's saying you weren't even at the station when this went down.  Listen, I know the truth no matter what he says.  Oh, yeah, you know the truth.  You're a salesperson, aren't you?  Ooh.  Oh.  Wow.  Pete coming back strong.  Damn.  Oh, I got jammed.  He called you a pen-totaling merry boy.  In so many words.  Gordon, stay out of it.  So the record rep brings by the hash, right?  Someone cooked up a tray.  Of hash brownies.  He ate about half of them.  Brought it in for the staff.  And the engineering department, as usual, when the free food around, jumps on it like 
[00:35:00]  vultures.  Right.  They had no clue.  Later that afternoon, he walked by the tech shop, and Pete's feet are up on the console.  He was sleeping in his chair.  I had to sleep it off.  What happened, Pete?  Is this the truth, Pete?  I don't think so.  Now, what happened?  What year was this?  I don't know.  That was a good piece of brownie there.  You don't even remember the year.  I usually mistake a week or something when I used to smoke some weed.  I was like, was that last week or this week?  He didn't even know what year it was. 
[00:35:30]  I love that.  Sometime between POP 7 and...  Monaghan was here.  Why, why, why?  Monaghan was in on a weekend show.  Monaghan.  It was like a...  How many years ago?  How about what decade?  It was probably like 20 years ago.  So we're talking the 80s.  Yeah.  So Scotts, it was in his 30th year here?  So what happened, Pete?  Well, I know.  I mean, they were good.  I mean, I tasted one that was very good.  Of course.  I had a second one, but I didn't remember anything.  After that.  You don't remember anything. 
[00:36:00]  And you were out cold for the rest of the day, right?  Earl.  Earl knows.  Earl, give us some more facts here.  No, the story I heard was that.  It was the 60s.  Free sex and drugs.  The story I heard was he was out a couple of hours in Master Control.  Just snoozing away.  Yeah?  You just fell asleep.  So you fall asleep when you do the wacky tabacky.  That's a great story, though.  I can imagine Pete Stone.  But now we find out he just falls asleep.  So he's not like the fun guy.  He's the guy that you want at the party, Stone.  Because when he falls asleep, we can light him on fire. 
[00:36:30]  You're that guy, right?  That you draw a dick on his forehead.  Like Brewer's friends.  Like Floyd the Barber.  Yeah.  Your only stories are secondhand, you know?  Right.  Well, that's why we wanted to go to the source here.  And get the news from you.  But you fell asleep.  I can't remember that far back.  Remember that episode of Barney Miller where they got the hash brownies?  Barney, Barney, Barney is your mother from Kelowna.  They were all stoned.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  You got to treat Pete well because one thing's for sure.  He's indestructible.  Oh, without a doubt. 
[00:37:00]  This dude rolled a car coming home from the Empire State Building one overnight.  And got out with just a scratch on the back of his hand.  Really?  Yeah.  Like the P.O.D. video.  That's Pete.  Later, boy.  All right, man.  Pete was in the van when the wheel fell off.  When the wheel fell off.  That's nice.  Remember that one, Pete?  Yeah, I remember.  Driving down the road and the...  He didn't think he was with me.  And the wheel fell off the damn thing.  What did you do to save Stinky's life?  Not much. 
[00:37:30]  He just fled the vehicle.  I'm out of here.  Save your own ass.  I was only going 10 miles an hour, luckily.  Yeah, good thing.  Who would leave somebody in the passenger seat or backseat of a car after an accident?  I don't know.  That seems like a heartless, cold thing to do.  Shut up.  You got to check your own crap first, man.  Check your own ass.  How long has Mr. Gazel been working here?  Pete's the best, man.  Pete Johnson.  Pete's off limits, Norton. 
[00:38:00]  Come on.  I like Pete very much.  All right.  Erin, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Real good.  I got a question for you.  I'm calling from Vegas, and I've heard you guys before in D.C.  Yeah.  Are you the guys that had the outdoor sex contest?  Oh, yeah.  Sex for Sam.  Sex for Sam.  Yes.  I just wanted to find that out.  You guys thinking of bringing that show here by chance, maybe?  You know, it's interesting that you bring that up, because we're going to do the 10th show from Vegas.  Fabulous.  Why wait 100 shows to come to your fine city? 
[00:38:30]  You know, why did we put it off in Philly for 100 shows?  Right.  I'm thinking we changed the rules right now.  Our 10th show should be from Las Vegas.  That's right.  Vegas is more fun.  The 10th show you guys hear, we're going to have to do it live in Vegas.  And does that mean that it's really the 9th show?  One, two, three.  Hey, Columbus, don't worry.  We'll do the 1,000th show for you.  Fabulous.  All right, Aaron, thank you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Hello, Vegas.  Yeah, as soon as we found out we were in Vegas, we're like, why wait? 
[00:39:00]  Let's go there tomorrow.  We've got a couple of positive calls.  I feel a buzz already.  Yeah, let's go.  It's time to hit the casinos, god damn it.  We'll be having a road show in room at 315.  Why not?  Why did we wait so long for Philly?  Why not?  All right.  We won't make that mistake again.  Hey, Lynch, are you going to play some songs today?  Yeah, I want to play a song today.  A song.  A song.  He's limiting himself now. 
[00:39:30]  Are you going to play the one we heard the other night at the Beacon Theater?  Yeah.  I like the new song.  Thank you very much.  I really like it.  With Tyke helping you out, right?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  He'll bring back some memories for some people.  I guess so.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  You're talking about Barney Miller before.  The best line on that was when Yamana went in.  He's talking to Barney.  He says, hey, Barney, what do you say?  We go down to the beach.  We shoot some clams.  Mushy, mushy, mushy.  Mushy, mushy, mushy.  Barney Miller.  I'm going to go down to the beach and shoot some clams. 
[00:40:00]  You guys suck.  Thank you, Kevin.  And the other guy, Ron Glass.  Yes.  He was all stoned and he had to go on a call.  And Barney goes, you okay to drive?  He goes, sharp as a tack.  Hey, Joe, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Calling out of Boston.  Yeah.  Just saying how psyched we are.  You guys are going to be up here for the Halloween show.  Oh.  Oh.  The costume contest there.  Oh.  Look at you letting something out of the bag. 
[00:40:30]  Ah.  Couldn't hold it in too much longer.  How do you know we're going to be up there for Halloween?  Huh?  How did you know we're going to be up there for Halloween?  It was on the website.  Oh, great.  Hey, shut up.  We just stole a bunch of tickets from our boss's office and we're going to give them away.  Oh, man.  Me and my buddy went to AAF Loco Bazooka with Rocco Sucks t-shirts.  Ah, nice.  How's the Rocco Sucks t-shirt look?  It says Rocco Sucks on the front.  We got them made.  And on the back it says O&A rules. 
[00:41:00]  Joe, it kind of sucks because we were hoping for a little fight with our old station, but  it's really, it's pretty much over already.  Well, they've been told by their boss.  They're just pussies.  They've been told by their boss.  They allowed us to just walk all over them.  And that's, there's no fun in that.  We are just like, BCN, we're psyched up here.  You guys are bad.  Rocco, the best defense is no offense.  Right.  So, I think that's the way I heard it.  Yeah, it's got to be right because it's coming out of your mouth, Dave.  Joe, we've completely destroyed them already.  Oh, yeah.  I got to tell you about that. 
[00:41:30]  They didn't even fight back.  What a drag.  Sad.  So, I guess now we're going to have to go after everybody else, like Howie Carr and  the rest.  Yeah.  Well, me and my buddy have the best costumes.  Maybe they'll give up, maybe Howie will give us a better fight than, than Rocco did.  Maybe.  Schlockhole.  Thetic.  What's your costume?  Me and my buddy are going as Dyson J. Moore.  That's great, man.  You rock, Joe.  That's funny.  My buddy just does a dead-on Dyson impression.  It's hilarious.  He's got the long, dark hair.  He puts it back.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  It's hilarious.  Yeah, Boston, we're coming for the Halloween party.  All right.  There it is.  We're real excited about Wow up here, too.  Cool.  And I think we're going to do a few radio shows from Boston as well.  Yeah, because we love you guys up there.  And, of course, the fifth show from Vegas live.  Yeah.  We're going to sneak that in.  And Columbus, don't worry.  We're coming.  2003.  The fifth show now.  You had to cut it in half now.  Huh?  The fifth show now.  You had to cut it in half.  Oh, did we?  Yeah.  I thought you were going to do the tenth show there.  Oh, really?  Joe, we're so excited.  I think by Friday we'll be in Vegas.  So, now, how far are you guys from the disaster now? 
[00:42:30]  0.3 miles?  No, we're about 1.3.  1.3 miles away.  It goes down every day.  1.3.  The Halloween party this year in Boston from Oedipus' secret room at BCN.  The secret room.  Oedipus is a tool.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Leave the guy alone.  And, by the way, we'll never go to Dallas because they don't really care for us.  Is it true they don't care for us?  Yeah.  The radio station doesn't even call us back.  Yeah.  Well, why are we on so late there? 
[00:43:00]  It's ridiculous.  I know.  It's very late at night.  They're driving home from the saloons at that hour.  We like to be hands-on.  We like to call all the cities, you know, on a daily basis.  And Dallas has never talked to us.  They could care less we're on their radio station.  They got too much country music going on down there.  They don't have time for you guys.  All right, Joe.  Well, thanks.  We'll see you for the Halloween show, all right?  Definitely.  You guys rock.  All right.  Rick?  Yeah, but Dallas does take the Saturday show.  Oh, they do?  Yeah.  They've never talked to us.  So does Chicago. 
[00:43:30]  I heard you guys at about 2 in the morning on my drive.  Yeah, great.  Yeah.  Cowboys don't get up on Saturday mornings.  Chicago does a very strange thing.  They run us 9 to 1, and then they run an hour from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, it's a little weird.  That is odd.  Because that's the audience you want to market to, prostitutes and insomnia.  Why not?  They're some of our best-seller listeners.  So that guy mentioned Andrew Dice Clay and Jay Moore. 
[00:44:00]  This damn fight has taken on a life of its own.  Yeah.  Now it's in the National Enquirer.  Started out on our radio show.  Then it went to page 6 in the Post.  Page 6, never on page 6, by the way.  And then all the extra and entertainment tonight.  They're all calling us.  We've been blowing them off.  And now it's in the latest National Enquirer.  Want me to read this really fast?  Sure.  Dice Man accused of harassment.  There is no love lost between comedians Jay Moore and Andrew Dice Clay.  The hostility between them has escalated since Tuesday when Clay put a call into the Opie and Anthony radio talk show while Jay Moore was on the air. 
[00:44:30]  Clay accused Moore of stealing bits.  Moore told Clay to die and get in the coffin.  And then called them a few choice names like Hebe and Jew.  Ouch.  That's when things got out of control.  Dice came back with, even though Moore may be trying to get his wife pregnant,  it still doesn't stop him from hitting on all the girls coming out of the bathroom at the comedy store in L.A.  Ouch.  It says, ouch.  Ouch.  Moore's wife, Nicole, was so peeved, she called Dice Man, 
[00:45:00]  who told her that her hubby needs to watch out at the Beacon where Moore is performing for charity on Sunday.  And look over his shoulder for me, he added.  Your husband will be in a million pieces.  We all know what happened to Sam Kinison when he crossed me.  Your husband will have to pay.  Now them's fighting words.  So Moore and his wife filed harassment charges against Dice and went back on the air with Opie and Anthony.  Dice called in again, calling Moore a sissy for filing the,  filing the complaint, but in the end apologized to Moore and tried getting him to make up. 
[00:45:30]  Moore wasn't having that, though.  He claims that Dice threatened him with violence and called his wife names to boot.  We wonder if Moore will be dealing with a heckler at the Beacon on Sunday night.  Yeah, a few people were, like, screaming out Dice stuff at the Beacon show.  Did the guy that wrote the story get Anthrax, by the way?  That's where it's from.  American media.  They do this.  They run the sun.  Don't even read it.  I'm not even going to read it.  You get eyes on Anthrax.  Anthrax are the eyes. 
[00:46:00]  Looking at the words.  As awful as Anthrax is, when everybody heard what building it was in,  it actually took a little of the sting out of it.  You know, that's so awful, but I think it's true.  A lot of people are like, yeah, a building in Florida.  Oh, Anthrax was found.  It's the building that houses American media,  which is the company that puts out the National Enquirer and the sun and all those.  The globe.  The globe.  So it's like, oh, then it's not that bad.  Yeah, well, it could have worked.  As long as it doesn't affect Bat Boy.  I sure hope it won't affect how Bat Boy is dealing with the crisis. 
[00:46:30]  The latest on this fight, by the way, it's done.  Yeah, they settled their differences.  Off the air, in private, and neither one wants to come on the air to discuss what they said to each other.  But they're all friends again.  Yes, at least that conflict can be put to rest, and we can concentrate on the war.  Because people are getting confused.  As the conflict rages on, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[00:47:00]  There's the conflict heating up between, no, not Afghanistan and the United States, Jay Moore and Andrew Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice Clay firing a volley of shots across the bow of Jay Moore.  Jay Moore filing police charges.  Jay thinking the police resource is not tied up enough, and he should then call the cops on a real menace to society.  Andrew Dice Clay. 
[00:47:30]  Great thinking, Jay.  And Dice, real smart.  You have a lot of money?  You want to keep it?  Keep the death threats, too.  So that's the latest.  Two of them are a couple of pumpkins.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, bro?  All right.  I got to ask Lynch to sing that Smashing Pumpkins song.  I just heard it yesterday online, and I was laughing my ass off. 
[00:48:00]  Lynchie, would you play that for us?  Sure.  Oh, nice.  And also, you should call your show now, the AOJ Show, because you've got Jim there all the time.  So that could be a new name for your show over there.  We might have an announcement soon.  Oh, yeah?  As far as Jim Norton goes.  Sure.  Sounds good.  Why not?  All right, guys.  All right, Mike.  Have a good day.  We're not renewing his contract, and he's off the show?  What contract?  He's got anthrax.  He's got anthrax.  Jim's other diseases would welcome anthrax.  Some good news about Jim Norton.  He doesn't have the hiv. 
[00:48:30]  He's got anthrax.  He's got a diseased social club in his bloodstream, waiting for anthrax to drop by.  He's got an uprising going on in his pants.  There's a spore on my mule, Doc.  He's playing with the others.  All right, Stephen Lynch is hanging with us today.  He's going to do a brand new song, maybe after we take a break, but a little taste of what Stephen Lynch is about.  I love this little ditty you do.  What is it again?  What if that guy from Smashing Pumpkins lost his car keys?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  You know, it's a short, catchy title.  Well, it's a short, catchy title.  Where the f*** are my car keys?  They were right here in my hand.  I had them just a second ago. 
[00:49:30]  Did I leave them in the kitchen or underneath the cushions of the couch?  I can't find them anywhere.  Oh, here they are.  Stephen Lynch.  Thank you.  I'm working on full-blown anthrax next.  And FBA could be the title.  That's right.  FBA do.  We played lullaby to start the show today, and everyone's writing in, come on, play FBA for the new cities. 
[00:50:00]  Can we play that as we go on a break?  No, you don't have to do it live, because we got a good copy already.  The big A used to be the big disease, man.  Now it's the big A's.  The anthrax.  And you don't even have fun getting it.  I know.  At least, you know, you're banging, and you're like, well, I got the AIDS, but man, that was some night, right?  Blood everywhere.  It was great.  Body fluid.  This one, it's like, oh, geez, I was breathing, and I got the anthrax. 
[00:50:30]  And then another great thing about anthrax I'm learning every day in horror is once you start feeling the symptoms, it's too late to be treated.  Oh, great.  Once you got the flu, you ain't got the flu.  Yeah, so you get a cold, and you might have just got a little cold.  Freak out.  Oh, it's a little cold.  It's nothing.  It's nothing.  You go to the doctor, you got it.  Oh, well, now the percentage of you surviving now is down to like one.  You should have come before anything was wrong.  Now everyone's going to the doctor when nothing's wrong, getting tested. 
[00:51:00]  What?  They have an antidote.  Why are we not having a vaccine?  Or whatever, right?  Should be vaccinated, all of us.  Yeah, the vaccine, I think, takes like nine weeks to get.  Six weeks of shots and stuff that you keep going back for.  Oh.  And by that time you're dead or running.  You know, I've got things to do.  I had to read hundreds of email from people that were saying I'm a cool bastard because of the Stalker Patty segment yesterday.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty upstairs. 
[00:51:30]  She's up, see?  See?  And you guys don't.  And we're not going to put Vegas through that again.  You guys don't understand, man.  She doesn't listen.  She doesn't learn.  You can tell her to go away.  She keeps coming back.  She was really crying yesterday, though.  Yeah, I felt pretty bad.  I just felt odd that she's crying that hard and I had an erection.  You've got a glimmer in your eye talking about it, right?  Hey, West Coast Dave.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, I hear you guys talking about all these other cities and going there and whatnot.  I think I might still be your only listener in San Francisco. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, how is San Francisco?  That's because you're, what, a mile from the radio station, right?  Right, a mile from the radio station.  I think he's 1.6 miles from the radio station.  1.4.  Because if you're more than three miles from the radio station in San Francisco, you can't pick us up.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what I'm hearing.  Yeah.  It's awful.  You know what we broadcast out there?  You ever see the Mr. Microphone that was on there?  You sing into it and it comes out of your radio as long as you're within three feet of your radio. 
[00:52:30]  That's our station there.  Isn't that true, Dave?  You can barely get the station?  That's absolutely true.  I still can't get it in my office building.  You know what it is, though?  See, West Coast Dave has a problem because there's obstacles between the station.  The antenna and his radio.  Right, right.  I'm on the wrong side of the station.  Like, you know, oxygen.  Things like that that are hard for radio waves to get through.  We've got molecular interference here.  How's it supposed to transmit through air?  All right, Dave.  Good luck to you guys.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  As we take a break, we found FBA. 
[00:53:00]  We found Stephen Lynch doing FBA at one of our road shows.  I remember that.  This is live.  That was the introduction of the second verse.  Yeah.  This is all Michael D. Nicola.  This is live in front of, like, 2,000 to 3,000 people.  About 2,500 people.  And you may do this for Philly next Wednesday.  You never know.  Maybe.  FBA.  Written by Jay Moore and Mike D. Nicola.  And not me.  Yeah, Stephen Lynch.  As reference in Time Magazine.  Stephen Lynch is just the Elton John of this song.  He just sings it. 
[00:53:30]  Right?  I'm the Robert Downey Jr.  I lip sync it.  Jay Moore was the Bernie Toffin.  Right.  Of this song.  I don't usually do cover songs, but this one's very special to me.  So I brought one of the co-authors of FBA, Mike D. Nicola.  Mike D. Nicola.  Mike has been kind enough to write a little extension to the song.  So if you listen closely, you might hear some things you haven't heard before.  Down to my target weight. 
[00:54:00]  Sarcoma popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth and all of my friends.  Looks like this time I'm hearing the answer of no names.  No need to lie.  No reason to fear.  When you're flat on your back, counting all your ribs.  I went to give blood.  They just showed me the door. 
[00:54:30]  I stood up to leave.  And I fell on the floor full blown.  Everybody now.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said damn that whore.  Yeah.  Damn that whore.  Let's break it down now.  Mike D. Nicola is going to do a little spoken word.  A little poetry. 
[00:55:00]  Because I know you guys can appreciate some good poetry, right?  Well, the FBA has set in and he's left feeling a little low.  Here you go, Mike.  Well, now I've got AIDS.  I don't feel so good.  So I'm going to go out and share it with my neighborhood.  Bartender, waitress, here's your tip.  That ain't acne above my lip.  Oh, you have to leave? 
[00:55:30]  No, that's okay.  I've got time to kill.  Maybe two or three days.  I'm sitting alone humming this song.  I start to think about everyone who done me wrong.  Who's done you wrong?  My fifth grade teacher.  Yeah?  Mr. Beck.  You're going to find a hypodermic in your neck.  Hey, it's in my restaurant.  What about it?  The tip's blue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, I ain't having a hypodermic in your stew. 
[00:56:00]  Oh!  And Wendy.  You remember me.  Wendy?  Yeah.  You stood me up for prom.  But I won't infect her.  You won't infect her?  I'm going to infect her mom.  Her mom?  School-blown AIDS.  Damn that horn!  Damn that horn!  Little motherfuckin' horn!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  F.P.  Are you bastards ready to roll?  Opie and Anthony.  And you'll actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for Sean Thatcher?  Oh, my God!  Hi, I feel so alive. 
[00:57:00]  Pete Johnson.  DOD alive.  Crawling from the records.  The O&A Show, 877-692-1027.  That's the number if you're in the New York area.  866-277 for WOW for everyone else.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up today?  What's going on, buddy?  All right.  I went to see Norton Friday night, 1030 show.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, Norton.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[00:57:30]  And what?  No, I just wanted to talk about Mindy Cohen who jumped on stage with him.  Oh, the girl that just came up for a second.  Yeah, with the hair?  What is that all about?  Mindy Cohen.  Yeah, that was a brokerage in Long Island.  And this girl came on.  I was talking about being single, and this insane, heavy woman was sitting right there  with that 1,000-yard marine stare, and she just kind of walked up and held my hand.  I'm like, all right, well, what are you?  Why?  I don't know.  No, Norton, I was waiting for you to rip into her.  You know why I didn't?  Because she was having fun. 
[00:58:00]  She wasn't being horrible.  But what do you say about her?  You know, Kathy Bates is holding my hand.  I didn't.  She was unbelievable.  Another thing about the brokerage, don't eat the food.  Why?  Is it bad?  I actually ate there both nights.  Yeah, no, Friday night, I ate the French fries.  Sunday morning, I was throwing up, and blood was shooting out of my nose.  It was unbelievable.  Thanks.  I don't like that F word, my friend.  That might have been the cocaine, my brother.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, French fries don't make you do that.  No cocaine.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  See you, bud. 
[00:58:30]  I enjoyed the food at the brokerage.  Gary, what's your problem?  What's my problem?  Yeah.  Dude, someone on the radio show has a nose whistle right now every time you breathe in, driving  me nuts.  A nose whistle?  A nose whistle.  Everyone breathe in.  Right now, I would rather toss Laverne and Shirley's salad while straining potty with anal  beats than listen to your nose whistle. 
[00:59:00]  Nice.  I don't know.  All right.  I don't know who has the nose whistle.  Just seriously, dude, please don't blow their nose, for the love of God.  All right.  We'll try to figure it out.  Thanks, brother.  All right.  Later.  Thank you.  That does suck at night, though, when you get that.  You've got to get up and blow your nose.  You're trying to get to sleep, and you just wipe it on the pillowcase.  Oh, God.  We're just digging each.  Snot rocket onto the pillowcase.  They cleared it right up.  I had a girl one time.  I was having sex with a girl about three years ago, and she had done a lot of blow. 
[00:59:30]  You heard somebody do a lot of blow, and their nose runs and leaks, and she was on, you know,  like I was laying back, and she was just sitting on me.  We were chit-chatting.  Right.  And a nice, clear drop landed right on my upper lip.  Absolutely true.  Awful.  Holy Jesus.  Nice, clear drop of drug-induced booger on my lip.  I'd give you a better awful, but I shredded my voice yesterday.  And most men would have lost their rod. 
[01:00:00]  That's funny.  Not you.  You're a troop for noise.  It was salty.  I tasted it, and I kept going.  Is Patty still upstairs?  She was the reason I shredded my voice yesterday.  Here's Opie not being able to talk today because of this.  Shut up!  Patty drove him to this yesterday.  Shut up!  That's electronic equipment and gauges just bending against the pins that they're supposed to stop them.  Completely shredded my vocal cords. 
[01:00:30]  Red lights on every piece of equipment in here.  Every word hurts today because of that.  Shut up!  I got to stop doing that.  Anyway.  Huh?  Wait, someone's got a story?  What?  Patty wanted to know.  She said, do you think they were really mad at me?  See, she has no grasp on reality.  And I said, I really don't know, Patty.  She goes, I was reduced to tears. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  You know what?  We saw.  We didn't get this on the radio yesterday.  There's a good possibility she also wet herself.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Is she upstairs so we could ask her?  I think so.  Mary, the intern, swears because she had to go in the bathroom with her after the episode on the show.  And she swears that she smelled you-know-what.  Yes.  And it was coming from Patty.  Our intern, Kimmy Gibbler from...  What show is that? 
[01:01:30]  I should know.  Full House.  Where is she upstairs?  Never concentrated on Kimmy.  Actually, no.  I think she left.  Ah.  But, yes, she was like, uh-oh.  I think she wet herself.  Wait, what?  Tyke has a great story about what happened when he ran into Patty real quick.  Tyke?  Yeah, right after the Beacon show, she got kicked out from upstairs.  Yeah.  And I was waiting for some friends of mine to come back down.  Shaking her fists into the air, screaming at the lords above.  I was part of the team, I thought. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, she's shaking her hands.  Why did I get thrown out?  Wheezing and crying.  Maybe that's her wheezing.  And I get the hate mail today.  And people don't understand the full story yet.  And someone in this room gave her a pass to get backstage.  And he's quickly leaving.  Dino, what the hell possessed you to give Patty a pass?  Well, like Tyke said, she was shaking her.  Mike, I just want to say good show.  I've got to get in.  I just want to say good show. 
[01:02:30]  I just want to say good show.  They won't let me.  How am I supposed to spread the anthrax if I can't get back there to kill them all?  So I went, all right, Patty, here.  This should, you can go in and say good show.  Were all six fists shaking on her insect-like hands?  Were they six fists just, or four, because she needs the other two to stand on.  So four fists shaking.  She was carrying a cornflip the size of a Volkswagen.  Well, they could carry so much more than their own weight. 
[01:03:00]  The ants like that.  Her little ant-like body quivering.  Oh, why, I just want to say good show.  She had a Godiva chocolate the size of a...  In her giant ant mandibles.  Pincers, yes.  Those pincers looking at you with those big compound eyes, seeing just hundreds of you.  I was intimidated, I have to be honest.  She looked in and went, boy, this is some crowd.  You know, it's the beacon, it's full, but she sees like 80 beacons full. 
[01:03:30]  I liked the Jane Moore's.  She thought she was at Giant Stadium.  I liked the Stephen Lynch Orchestra, the old play guitar.  Yeah, you're lucky.  She could have carried you right off.  She could carry many times her own weight.  Very nice.  Well, a lot of people are asking for the new Stephen Lynch song.  Okay.  Yes.  So we can play this 200 times on our show. 
[01:04:00]  I think some listeners will relate to this.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Should we just launch into it, or I guess we don't need any explanation?  Yeah, we don't need the formalities anymore.  Stephen Lynch, more spins on this show than the Beatles yesterday on any other stage.  You could find his records in the secret room.  What's that?  Stephen, you're going to have to give us 12 CDs before we can play this.  That's how they used to do it in the old days.  In the old days.  Artists had to give 12 CDs to the program director. 
[01:04:30]  He would, in turn, go to the CD store and sell them.  And sell them.  Right.  Or sell them out of the secret room somehow.  The ones with the little holes clipped in the side.  And then you could get your song on the radio.  So we need Stephen Lynch CDs for the secret room.  That's great.  Here we go.  This is me and Mark Teich here.  Let's get a little harmonica. 
[01:05:00]  Woo!  I'm sorry.  I got my 12-sided die and I'm ready to roll with a wizard and my goblin crew.  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement bringing Funyuns and the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard. 
[01:05:30]  And that stereo's a pumping Zeppelin.  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light.  Let the dungeons and the dragons begin.  It's D&D.  Fighting with the legends of yore.  It's D&D.  Never kissed a lady before.  Nope.  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  A little solo play. 
[01:06:00]  Watch out.  Now the Lord of the Rings, the dark crystal and things, we use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school.  No, we're not.  I know.  Now Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  He's got hit points and charisma to lend.  And I rehearse in my room are what I call the dragons to.  When I'm not with my girlfriend, it's D&D.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You got a girlfriend? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D.  Virgins till the day we...  One, two, three, four.  Dad! 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Nice.  Steven Lynch.  Thank you very much.  D&D.  D&D.  Yeah.  Loved the D&D growing up.  That was on a suggestion from Mike DiNicola.  We went to a school to play once and we looked in the corner.  There were some kids playing D&D during the show.  Oh, was it during the show?  Yeah.  During the show.  There you go.  We had to get revenge.  With a broadsword made out of cardboard.  Right.  Brought it to the show.  Little cloaks.  12 o'clock.  12 o'clock in the afternoon.  Little cloaks and everything.  We interrupted their frickin' D&D game in our little comedy show at their school. 
[01:07:30]  So did you have to do much research to learn about, you know, the die?  I did.  And the charisma and hit points and whatnot?  I knew none of that stuff.  You knew none of it?  But I did know a kid who played D&D.  Ah.  Bro.  Ah.  He wanted to come up to the studio today just to hang out.  And I told him that'd be perfect because then I could blame the whole D&D thing on him.  Yeah, Rod played a little D&D.  Some roommate years ago was like, you want to play Dungeons and Dragons?  I'm like, well, what the hell is that, you know? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, it's great.  That's how they, oh, it's unbelievable.  You get so into it.  And so I'm like, all right, all right.  So I'm thinking, you know, either some kind of a board game or something that's a little easy to understand with defined sets of rules and whatnot.  No, it's up to one person what goes on.  You roll the dice and then they say, oh, well, that means.  And then the dungeon master, I guess, tells a story about what you just did.  Right.  Like, this sucks.  Your dagger was eaten by a hobgoblet. 
[01:08:30]  I never saw it.  You got that from a four on my 38-sided die?  Yeah.  How did you get that?  I roll and it's like, okay, well, you just struck him, but now you have a leg injury that will take...  I got nothing.  This sucks.  Bring on the video game.  I hated that game because you couldn't win.  There was no winning.  There was no winning.  It was just a game that went on forever.  Awful.  And I felt, I left feeling like if I had given a man oral, I'd have been more of a man.  That's how gay I felt. 
[01:09:00]  Now I don't feel so bad.  Sorry about that.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  I just got to tell Steven that, and I hate to admit it, but that was me in high school.  Was it?  Yeah.  There's a lot of people.  I was a big nerd.  Those games went on for months, too, right?  They never ended.  Yeah.  Some of them actually ended in death.  In death, yes.  Some people would kill or take their own lives.  You just had those D&D lawsuits at the same time as the Judas Priest lawsuits going on. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  It was before video games, and that violence, you were able to sue that.  I changed my opinion.  Really?  Anything that causes high school students to kill themselves is a good thing.  You like that.  Yes.  Ozzy, what's up?  No, it's offy.  Offy.  Get it right.  What?  Offy.  Offy.  Offy.  I got a bone to pick with you, too.  I'm like, why do you always put down AIDS?  Thousands of people have died of AIDS.  Put down AIDS?  Because it's a horrible disease. 
[01:10:00]  I know.  Do you want us to talk it up?  Laugh about it.  We don't laugh about the AIDS.  Oh, yes, you do.  It's a horrible disease.  We wish it on people we don't like.  Oh, well, don't bring the AIDS up.  You know, I mean, AIDS, anthrax, it's going to get somebody someday.  I don't believe this person for a second.  You can't be for real.  Hold on.  Let me check.  Yes, I'm for real.  No, you're not.  You have the worst voice out there, man.  That's a bad voice.  No, no, no.  I'm for real, honey.  Trust me.  Go ahead.  Do your joke.  Go ahead.  What was the payoff going to be?  No, no joke.  No, I like the payoff. 
[01:10:30]  Now, if we would have believed you, how would this have ended?  You'd have said what?  Say that again.  I could barely hear you.  Rich little, ladies and gentlemen.  Hello.  Red bucket.  Where's the payoff?  There's no payoff on it.  This is the truth.  What happened to your voice?  It's a long story.  What do you do when you're not having a cooking show in England?  That is not, I am not a female.  Trust me.  No, your voice is fake.  No, it's not.  Well, it's a put on fake voice.  It had something to do with a shotgun to the throat. 
[01:11:00]  Shut up!  Ouch.  Thank you.  There she goes.  Okay.  He, she, wha.  Whatever is right.  All right, we'll be back.  O.P.  Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Honduras.  Effin' Honduras.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's the name of it.  And we're back with the O&A Show.  Hey, is Crystal Method playing our Halloween party in Boston?  Nice. 
[01:11:30]  Bobby Big Rager, what's going on, man?  Hey, O&A, how you doing today?  All right.  Hey, O.P., I want to thank you for making me a very rich guy.  Why is that?  You're going to the Islanders game?  Islanders home opener Saturday against those pussies, the Detroit Red Wings, yes.  There you go.  Hey, Vegas, listen up.  All your money on the Red Wings.  All righty?  And you heard it here.  All right, Bobby, thank you.  All right, back to their Spud's Buckley. 
[01:12:00]  Thanks for helping them out, Jim.  Bye.  Thank you.  Hmm.  You know, your awful sports is going to actually bring back Vegas, because they've been having  problems since the attacks, but I'm telling you, they are going to love you.  Awful.  Just awful.  Matthew, what's up?  Matthew.  Yo, yo, what's up, guys?  What's going on, bro?  Yeah.  Listen, Link's song, awesome.  Awesome.  Dungeons & Dragons tune?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  You know, it's funny, because these guys who play Dungeons & Dragons, 
[01:12:30]  they just, they lose touch with reality.  They really do.  I don't know.  In elementary school, this one kid, he was just obsessed with it.  Thought he was the character.  Yeah.  And we used, you know, we were kids, and we used to pick on him and bully him around  and stuff.  And just one day, he just snapped.  He just snapped.  And he's getting dragged off the recess field by the one-shades, and he's screaming at everyone.  I mean, a white cross-dragon cast a thousand-year sleep spell on all of you.  It was just so much. 
[01:13:00]  What a nerd.  And it just continued through elementary school and junior high and high school.  You try to use spells on you?  Yeah, man.  I was like, oh, no.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  I'm shaking in my boots here.  It'd be like a hierarchy.  If they're doing well in their little game, like, the rest of the people would give him  more props in real life.  Like, he's the guy.  And meanwhile, everyone else is just beating him up more.  He would get to sit at the head of the table.  He's probably an astrophysicist.  Right, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  He's out to the corner.  Yeah, he gets the head of the table.  Where's the dragon master?  He had duct tape put on his ass cheeks, and his hair was ripped off.  Thank you, Matthew.  All right, listen, you guys rock, and what's up to all my brothers in the North Mass?  People fired upon me.  All right, right on.  We put duct tape on his ass cheeks and pulled the hair off.  That Judd, who was that Judd Nelson, right?  That was Emilio Estevez.  No, Emilio Estevez.  No, no, no, the bad, the tough kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really, really was good.  But Emilio Estevez was the one that put the duct tape on the kid's ass cheeks. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Larry, no.  When?  Breakfast Club, though, man, that was really good, because it shows you, like, how different  people get together and can still really make a movie that sucks.  Like the faggots apologizing.  Hey, Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Norton.  Bye-bye.  Hey, did you guys hear about the new Rush Limbaugh joke?  No.  No.  Neither did he.  Hey, whoa.  Hey. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, man.  That's awful.  Thank you, Eric.  You got it.  He's hearing impaired, guys.  He's on loan from God.  Poor guy.  Hey, what's going on with the bombing?  We are doing very well from my updates that I get from Washington on a daily basis.  It seems that we are running out of things to bomb from the air.  Oh, sucks.  It took two days of night bombing for us to clear the way enough where we could do day  bombing without worrying much about any aircraft. 
[01:15:00]  We dropped, what, like 10 bombs today because there's nothing left?  Yeah, it's kind of hard.  We're sending out limited amounts of planes.  Some of the daytime raids, one, two planes at a time being sent out dropping bombs.  It's like nothing.  Then they were using these shoulder-held Stinger missiles that we had supplied the Afghanis  when they were fighting the Soviets.  But we fly so high up there dropping these things that they can't even come close to hitting us.  It's a mess over there. 
[01:15:30]  And they're running out of stuff to fire back at us.  They're running out of ammunition.  Pakistan was the only one that was really supporting Afghanistan.  And now they have their...  No more bullets?  Hey, laughing boy, no more bullets.  You know, it's turning that bad for them.  Here's a little picture.  I might give you a little...  Before and after.  It's a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.  If you could tell, I think you could tell yourself, the top photo is before.  The bottom is, I believe, a shot of the Apollo 11 landing. 
[01:16:00]  On the moon.  Place on the moon.  It looks like a picture from the moon.  Nothing.  Nothing left.  Left.  A bunch of craters.  There's a training camp.  Look, there's all little, like, a complex and buildings.  And then down here, I see the...  What is that?  The Sea of Tranquility, I believe they called it.  It's just...  It's beautiful.  I love it.  I hear we're going to send the Girl Scouts in to kind of finish the job.  Clean up. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  It's just no competition.  And thank God, I just got to say it right now, all the planes and people coming back unscathed.  These people didn't even understand what they were dealing with.  And once the air gets cleared, then the fun can start.  Where you start bringing in the attack copters that get down nice and low and just wipe them out.  Wipe them out.  Although I understand they have a real ringer there.  There's some guy that can throw a rock 50,000 feet into the atmosphere. 
[01:17:00]  He's good.  They contribute nothing.  They've invented nothing.  Enough already.  God, it's aggravating.  Just drop bombs on these monkeys.  Randy, what's up?  Well, I was going to ask when you guys were coming out to Cleveland.  Yeah.  But then you just need to make that nasty Red Wings comment there.  What?  What, everyone know the Islanders are going to kick the Red Wings' ass this Saturday night at the Coliseum?  Please!  Did the Wings move to Cleveland?  Come on!  The Red Wings are like, I know they've had a couple of back years, but we got the guys this year. 
[01:17:30]  Why are you a Red Wings fan?  Well, I was right in Detroit, moved here to Cleveland, and the Blue Jackets don't really count as a hockey team.  So, still a Wings fan.  There's no way I'm going to root for Pittsburgh.  All right.  But you guys do need to come out to Cleveland.  All right, but why'd you mention Pittsburgh?  What?  Why'd you mention Pittsburgh?  Well, a lot of the people here in Cleveland, like, if they watch hockey, we'll watch them. 
[01:18:00]  You know, a lot of Pittsburgh fans in Cleveland.  For hockey.  For hockey.  Because the Blue Jays suck?  Well, the Blue Jackets are like the Blue Jackets last year.  The Blue Jackets.  The Blue Jackets, of course.  Don't bring badminton into this opening.  All right.  Do you watch hockey?  What?  Do you like hockey a lot, do you?  Yes, I do.  You should just be bringing beers to your husband while he watches the house needs to  be clean.  Please.  Scrub the toilet so it's clean when he goes to defecate in between periods during the 
[01:18:30]  hockey game.  So, when are you guys going to come out to Cleveland?  Hey, Randy, you guys like doggy style so you can both watch the hockey game?  Unfortunately, I'm single.  Otherwise, you know, it might be an option.  Well, maybe if you kept the chip bowl full during the game, you'd have somebody there to  love and hold you.  Anyway.  We're going to make it to Cleveland.  You promise?  Yes.  All right.  We'll be listening.  Is it snowing there yet? 
[01:19:00]  No.  All right.  We have, what, two more weeks before it starts snowing?  If you're lucky.  If we're lucky.  Great.  No, we'll make it up there, Randy.  All right.  I'll be looking for you.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  There she goes.  Randy from Cleveland.  She was a little upset with that.  You see some of the planes that we're sending out?  It's wonderful.  They have things like War Party written on the fuel tanks of the planes.  And I saw a lot of bombs being dropped that have NYPD, we'll never forget, painted on  the bombs, which is just great. 
[01:19:30]  We're showing these beasts how Boeing equipment is supposed to be operated.  Which Boeing machinery is used for transporting passengers and which is used for devastation?  Yeah, I understand.  They hit us pretty good with the transportation portion of Boeing.  But when they see the devastation that is brought with the Boeing products that have  high explosives in them, it's just beautiful.  It's beautiful.  I just want to know how Bin Laden got that Timex watch. 
[01:20:00]  The Iron Man Timex watch.  He was talking and he had the Timex on.  He's got a Timex on?  He hates the Bin Laden watch.  You know they'll be pitching that on some channel.  He hates America so much, but he's wearing a Timex watch.  Well, you see all the protests in Pakistan, they're all drinking Pepsis.  Yeah, they drink the Pepsis.  And one guy was driving through the streets, firing his machine gun out the window of a  Ford vehicle.  And he had the Ford guy, the little cartoon character, urinating on the Chevy logo.  It's like, you know, we have our religion and Allah, but hey, Ford kicks Chevy's ass. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, great.  Why don't they have things like truck pulls there to occupy their time?  You know what's the problem?  We hate America.  Who did Opie pick in the Islanders game?  Yeah, exactly.  And they're wearing like Chicago Bulls jerseys and stuff.  Yeah, what's that?  The Toyota trucks with the machine guns on the back have the Yosemite Sam back off mud  flaps.  Back off, rabbit.  Now I gotta go back to the terrorist camp and get another bullet.  Oh! 
[01:21:00]  Okay, Doc.  Keith the Cop, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up, man?  We love the NYPD thing on the bombs, but I have one problem.  I saw that in the paper today.  That is so cool.  Isn't that rule?  We love it.  Yeah.  One problem I have.  If you look in the Daily News and it talks about the bombers.  Yeah.  And it gives like the whole rundown on the self-bomber.  Uh-huh.  And it says we pay $2.2 billion a piece for them. 
[01:21:30]  Yep.  We have 16 of them and we have five reserves, so that's 21.  Why does it cost us $127 billion to maintain them for one year?  Why not just get new ones?  I got you.  It costs more to maintain them than to build them?  Right.  It's at $2.2 billion and we have 21 of them and it costs $125, $127 billion to maintain  them for one year.  Keith, did you see those things screaming out of Missouri?  Unbelievable.  Did you see the devastation?  Have you seen like footage of these things in action? 
[01:22:00]  It's well worth the price of admission.  Of course, but I'm thinking $127 million.  Let's get another 50 or 60 of them.  It gives you goosebumps when you see those damn things fly.  I love it.  They don't even make a noise.  No.  Like a virgin farting.  I saw it at the Super Bowl.  It went right over my head at the Super Bowl for about 7,500 feet over my head and I said,  best money I ever spent.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  You know, I know the tax dollars and everything going towards all these equipment and that's 
[01:22:30]  why I love the wars.  You know, you're watching on TV and you feel good about paying your taxes.  I don't like just seeing my tax money going to the crack babies.  You know what I mean?  I want to see some machinery, some devastation and whatnot.  And then they're talking that this campaign might take a while, you know, to finish.  So the expense of it is going to be huge.  So they get these things.  They're little add-on devices for these bombs.  They're global positioning, the satellite systems, that they strap on old bombs that now 
[01:23:00]  turn them into guided bombs.  20 grand apiece.  Nice.  Cheap.  You win?  It's an upgrade.  You win?  I'm in.  Of course.  I would buy one in a second just to watch what it did.  Why don't we strap them on the crack babies?  Strap them on the crack babies.  Wouldn't you do that, though?  You pay 20 grand and for that you get a picture of the bomb.  You get your name on it.  Embossed on the side.  And a picture of the destruction.  A picture of the devastation.  Of course.  And it's your bomb.  Not just a rivet on the tail fin.  It's my bomb.  It's like Adopt-A-Highway. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  Or when a company goes in and they all buy lotto tickets.  Screw that.  All chip in.  You have your corporate bomb.  And we can drop them.  They're affordable to everyone now.  They finally did that in the government.  Everyone.  Every company can afford a bomb.  You got a thousand people in your company.  How much do you need?  20 bucks each?  You chip in.  You bought yourself a bomb.  And you feel good about dropping it.  And you get videos of the government putting a bunch of diarrhea-colored arms in a pile  after your bomb is dropped effectively on some tent village. 
[01:24:00]  Diarrhea jokes.  Always funny.  Oh, my God.  The genius.  A.R.  You're a crystalline genius.  Tim.  Yeah.  I don't know how to do that.  Anthony, he finally called us back.  Oh, here he is.  Tim Sabian.  Tim Sabian, the program director of WYSP in Philadelphia.  I was in a meeting.  I'm sorry.  A meeting?  What could possibly be more important than Opie and Anthony in your life? 
[01:24:30]  Tim, we want to know what's going on with the tickets.  You're giving these tickets to the hardcore fans of the show.  We're giving them away every hour.  Not concert pigs that call your station every hour because they think they're making a Godfather  DVD or something.  Ticket stops during the day.  Melissa's out there with tickets.  Yeah.  You know, and doing a ticket stops, we're giving them away.  It's to fans, to O&A fans.  And a lot of our listeners want to know why you're such a control freak.  Like, we feel like you are the only one that have the tickets, and you're not giving them out, really.  No, we're giving them out.  It's like, okay, Melissa, I'll give you 20 to give away today, but let me have the rest of them. 
[01:25:00]  Whatever way you want us to give them out, we'll give them out.  Can I ask a question, Mr. Stallone?  Is it possible that you could have a guy giving them out instead of Melissa?  Because he'll give them the chicks who might wow.  Yeah, we need some chicks at the road show when we come to Philly.  Okay.  An announcement to the ladies, it's safe to go to an Opie and Anthony road show.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes, it is.  We'll handle that.  And what's going on with listeners hanging outside the studio while we're doing our radio show 
[01:25:30]  and doing lunch with the salespeople at noon?  Uh, how many people do you want outside?  Uh, a few.  Okay, we'll do our best.  I just, you know, we've got security issues we've got to deal with.  What?  He's controlling, Jim, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  People are calling you the ticket Nazi, like the soup Nazi from Samba.  You'll get no tickets.  Right.  No tickets.  Hey, is this general admission or is it seating?  Now you'll get nothing. 
[01:26:00]  No questions.  No tickets for you.  We'll do our best.  How many tickets have you given out for the road show, Tim?  I don't have a count exactly, but we have like a...  A couple hundred?  No, at least a couple hundred.  You're not giving a lot to the sponsors and stuff?  No, no, no.  It's going to be ONA fans.  Good.  And Tim, you'll be there?  Absolutely.  So we can bring you on the stage?  Oh, thanks a lot.  So people could yell and scream for you?  They'll love you.  I'll do whatever I can for the listeners.  They know that.  All right.  Sabian, will I be able to meet all those sales folks? 
[01:26:30]  That's going to be fun.  Hey, we met your splooge guy the other day.  Splooge guy?  It makes it sound like it's his lover.  Yeah, he was a lovely guy there, Tim.  He was a nice guy, yeah.  You were awfully excited to introduce the splooge guy, didn't I?  Was he introduced as the splooge guy?  I miss that.  I don't know what his real name is.  I thought it was just the guy that had a product that makes your bodily fluids taste like fruit.  Well, it is apple or citrus. 
[01:27:00]  That's splooge guy.  I have a valid question.  Is it harder to get flavored splooge off your back?  I wouldn't know.  Good answer, Tim.  I can't help you out there.  All right.  Well, we're all looking forward to going to Philadelphia next Wednesday.  We can't wait to have you.  What's on the menu for lunch?  What would you like?  I don't know.  Some, you know, cute little sandwich things.  Gotcha.  Cute little sandwich things.  Doing a spinal tap thing, you know.  A little cute little sandwich. 
[01:27:30]  I want big bread.  This is a catastrophe.  Now, if you fold it, it just gets smaller.  Right.  But I'm a professional.  I will rise above.  No brown M&M's.  Yeah.  We'll have a rider when we get there full of stupid little things.  All right, Tim.  Okay.  Hey, are you giving away the tickets, say, in there for Days of the New?  Yes.  And Days of the New will be there.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere, Tim.  We got Sean on the phone. 
[01:28:00]  Sean?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I've been trying to win tickets for a week.  Everybody I hear that calls up and wins says, oh, can I get tickets to the Days of the New  concert?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, I want to take it to the way.  I don't give a hell of that.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Tim?  We'll have to straighten that out.  Tim, comment?  I don't know.  That's what I like.  Why are they interpreting it that way?  He should be in control of our government with that.  I don't know.  It's the O&A 100th show with special guests, Days of the New.  Right.  But maybe we're filling the place with just Days of the New fans. 
[01:28:30]  I don't know about that.  And they'll, like, boo us to get off and get on with Days of the New.  Maybe we could just put the tickets in food packages and drop them to the Afghan refugees.  That didn't work.  All right, Tim.  We just want the place filled with O&A fans.  Okay.  It will be.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Thanks, you guys.  John, thanks for being a tattletale.  Yeah.  For being a tattletale.  You'll get no tickets.  Hey, get his name and number for me, will you?  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  All right.  Nothing. 
[01:29:00]  Thanks, guys.  There he goes.  He's actually a great guy.  He brought us to Philly.  Okay.  What are you guys whispering at?  It's on the air.  What's that?  Yeah.  It's all right.  Nick, you're next on the O&A show.  Touch me.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  I'm an extra Marine.  I'd probably give my left nut, well, maybe not a nut, but to be one of those door gunners,  you know, from Full Metal Jacket.  Yes.  He tells us about, hey, you ever kill women and children?  He goes, sometimes.  He goes, how can you do that?  You just don't lead them as much. 
[01:29:30]  Nice.  That was great.  All right, Nick.  Thanks.  All right.  Peace.  I think he's gunning down a woman while she's running.  People who run are VC.  If they stand still, they're well-disciplined, VC.  That's classic, man.  Do we have the Full Metal Jacket prank calls?  The President notifies Congress about troop deployment.  He sent notice to Congress Tuesday of his decision to deploy U.S. troops and forces for combat operations in Afghanistan. 
[01:30:00]  We have claimed air supremacy over Afghanistan in two days.  Jesus Christ.  It's like our fight against AF.  Oh, just nothing coming back.  Give us something we could sink our teeth into.  How, you want to play the Walmart?  Listen to this prank call.  Using the Full Metal Jacket clips.  Thank you for choosing your 24-hour to the Walmart, huh?  I jerked a call.  What's your name, scumbag?  Excuse me?  What's your name, fat buddy?  This is Walmart.  Well, no s***. 
[01:30:30]  It's Walmart.  I admire your honesty.  What are you looking for?  Do you some s***?  One, two, three!  Hello?  What's your name, fat buddy?  What's your name?  Walmart.  Oh, really?  And how are you doing today?  What have we got here?  A s*** comedian.  What's the matter, sir?  Do you some s***?  Good evening, Frank.  Speak.  I'm going to help you, please.  What's your name, scumbag?  Who am I speaking to, sir? 
[01:31:00]  Walmart.  Huh?  Walmart.  Walmart.  Okay, what can I do for you?  Do you some s***?  Okay.  I like that one.  He's calling in Thursday, you know.  Yes, we will speak with Gunnery Sergeant.  That's right.  Jim Gaffigan in the studio, Anthony.  Jim.  Hi.  I'm very surprised to see you back in the studio with O&A.  Yeah, why, Clay's not here, huh?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Jim Gaffigan.  No, he's a great guy.  The farmer guy.  Hey, he looks like a farmer. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, farmer.  He's a farmer.  Hey, we, you a farmer.  And we were just like, hey, Jim, so what do you got going on?  And he'd start talking, and it's like, yeah, you kids, okay?  Talk to me.  I need the center of attention.  Yeah, he's great.  He's funny.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, it took me, you know, because it took me like an hour to get up here, because,  you know, if anyone's going to look like a Muslim extremist, it's going to be the balding, 
[01:32:00]  pale view.  Hey, hey, hey.  Maybe that's why security was checking you, Mr. Potty Mouth.  I'd like to apologize now.  Well, you look a little Muslim, sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've been dropping bleach bombs on them.  That apparently is the cause of...  We should just, we should just level Afghanistan, and just to piss everybody off, put like a  big casino in there.  Yeah.  And then, just like, you know, oh, yeah, you guys want jobs? 
[01:32:30]  You can take off those veils and start dancing.  Yeah.  And all the men have to sell pork products outside of the casinos.  Hey, Jim, did I see you're trying to pick up chicks outside the bathroom at the comedy  store?  What is the deal with him and Jay Moore?  Exactly.  Well, the fight's over, Fish.  Yeah, the fight's over there.  But the media will not let it die.  It's now in the National Enquirer.  Is it in the National Enquirer? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, that's what you got in front of it.  The anthrax running rampant through their building, but thank God they're still pouring out the  news that really matters.  And then called him a few choice names like Hebe.  Good career move, Jay.  Hey, in Jay's defense, he didn't say Hebe, it was Kike.  So, I really...  What?  You know, I don't like when people get misquoted.  Wow.  I thought we were all just having fun here.  Yeah, it was quite the little battle between the two, but it was short-lived, and they 
[01:33:30]  kissed and made up, from what I hear.  That's good.  Thank God for that.  I think I got anthrax.  You got anthrax?  You wouldn't know if you had it, though.  That's what's scary about it.  I know, but I'm tired all the time.  I think I've had anthrax for like 10 years.  I got some serious anthrax.  Either that, or it's just diarrhea.  It's just something no one ever got.  And then all of a sudden, we're, you know, two people down in Florida.  Yeah, you get anthrax.  Don't you get it from, like, poo? 
[01:34:00]  You get it from livestock.  Yeah, they have to get it.  Horse poo.  And there's a few different ways.  You can ingest it in the meat of these animals.  And then they find it on a keyboard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, there's been some cloven-hoofed beast typing an email.  And you use this computer.  You're asking for trouble.  He was asking for it.  Trying to download that footage with the horse.  Remember that?  Horse gag.  He's trying to download horse gag, a video clip, a horse. 
[01:34:30]  You ever see that, Jim?  You see much pornography on the internet?  I am a Christian.  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, he doesn't look like a porno guy, Anthony.  No, no.  I just don't admit it.  Really?  Because everyone has seen that clip of the woman giving treats to the horse.  No, she was actually doing what us guys love girls to do to us.  To a horse, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  God, that would be a bummer to be the guy that that woman turned down for a day.  Yeah, no, I can't go out. 
[01:35:00]  I asked her out, and she was messing around with a horse.  She said she wasn't into sex.  And there she is, just going to town, and then at the moment of glory there, it looks  like she was in a fribble drinking contest and lost.  You know?  It just...  The only thing missing from that shot was the Stebbins Freeway sign.  What?  Really too weird a reference.  Yeah, wow. 
[01:35:30]  You might have to explain that.  I'm not sure if the two people that got it are just dying right about that.  Someone will get it on the S&P back.  Hey, we've got to play Stinky Song, and then we've got to hang with Jim Gaffigan for a while.  Hell yeah.  He's on the new Ellen show.  Yeah.  I like your own man.  I like the other show, though.  Yeah, I know.  I like New York.  Yeah.  I enjoy your commercials with Derek Jeter.  Yeah.  I've seen those.  Yeah.  But you're sitting next to him at the Anthrax keyboard, and you're talking about computers  and stuff. 
[01:36:00]  We were at the Anthrax board.  He gave me Anthrax.  Was it Jeter that did it?  It was Jeter.  Yeah.  He's been with some animals.  Hey, Stinky, come in here.  Someone made a song about you.  Yeah, PR's friend, Orlando.  Oh, that's who this is?  Yeah.  This is Orlando?  You want to hear Stinky's song, Anthony?  Stinky has a song.  How cool is that?  Jim, Stinky's got a song.  Thank God.  It was too long.  It's been too long.  Stinky answers the phones for our show. 
[01:36:30]  Wasn't one of the Bombers nicknamed Stinky?  Stinky, wow.  And he also gets our guest high, Jim.  Oh.  Yeah.  If you partake in that sort of thing.  You like the marijuana?  Well, as long as it's not for public consumption.  No.  Yeah, no.  You smoked the wacky tobacco there, Jim.  Only if it makes me cool.  Yeah.  Only if it's the in thing to do.  Well, you want to take a trip to the stairwell?  It's the trip to the stairwell is where it all goes down.  Stinky, are you having the guests sign the stairwell if they spend time there? 
[01:37:00]  We always bring it up, but then we always forget.  Yeah, because you're stuck.  You just don't.  Stinky's, the stairwell is getting like Studio 54 used to be.  Stinky's got a velvet rope.  Some people just aren't cool enough to get in anymore.  And you've got to try to talk your way in with Stinky now.  It used to be easy, but now, you know, the rope and security.  I've had it with that place.  That's not a hip spot to go to anymore.  And then he's at the team board.  Oh, jeez.  Stinky, does Jim look like a dope smoker to you? 
[01:37:30]  Dope smoker?  Do I look like a dope smoker?  Do I smoke Indian hay?  All the adjectives from that eighth grade paper.  Indian hay, hemp.  All right, well, here's the song for Stinky.  Stinky's song, and then we'll hang.  Yeah.  Tony Toons Productions.  And I'm Zet-Apps.  Zet-Apps.  Zet-Apps Productions.  You smell that? 
[01:38:00]  Stinks.  Smell the weed or something.  I don't know what it is.  Smoking a bowl or drinking booze.  Girls, he may smile or wink at you.  Fellas, if you meet him and you think he's cool,  then what do you say?  Stinky, roll.  Smoking a bowl or drinking booze.  Girls, he may smile or wink at you.  Fellas, if you meet him and you think he's cool,  then what do you say?  Stinky, roll. 
[01:38:30]  New intern on his first day.  Was a little nervous, so he stunk in the worst way.  That's how he got his name.  I heard Stinky smokes a lot of haze.  Yo, we got him, baby.  Man, Garrett's not embarrassed.  We eat to Stinky's like carrots to a rabbit.  Trees to stink like crackers to a parrot.  He can spill the joint or pack it in a chalice.  The kind butt with the red hair trace.  Stinky Jim Brewer chillin' in the staircase.  Huffin' splits, talkin' about aliens. 
[01:39:00]  Stinky's last roommate was an old man who touches kids.  That was not his dream goal.  He couldn't wait to go back to work and stream phone.  With ONA bringing trouble to any one of you.  Now he's gettin' paid from WNEW.  He smoked sex with fans, too.  Got the victory on sex for Sam, too.  I say farewell, cause me, stinky ODPR, gonna make the air smell up in the stairwell.  Smokin' a bowl or drinkin' booze. 
[01:39:30]  Girls, he may smile or wink at you.  Fellas, if you meet him and you think he's cool,  then what do you say?  Stinky rules.  They sound pretty stoned.  That's really good.  Yeah.  I like it.  Really good.  Stinky rules.  Jim, you diggin' the rhyme?  I think we got a hit.  You like the rhyme in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  Didn't they just sound so stoned? 
[01:40:00]  They all sounded like completely stoned.  Had a nice little groove to it.  Little vibe, right?  It was very nice.  The Middle Eastern flavor is pretty appropriate.  That's nice.  Middle Eastern laugh.  See, that or wherever I may roam.  I liked it.  It was very mesmerizing.  Is it true not many people go to the stairwell anymore?  Cause it's just too crowded.  It's not like the place to be anymore.  Ever since that song, it's changed everything.  Yeah.  You know?  Right?  Now everyone wants to come and see it. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Taking pictures.  It's like a tourist place now.  Yeah.  It's not cool anymore.  It's weird.  They play that music when you're in the stairwell, too.  I heard a cool place, though.  It's right around the corner.  It's called the Stock Room.  And that's going to take off soon, I think.  That's the next hip spot.  No, they put too much money into it up front.  You know, there's a restaurant below you called the Red Eye.  Yeah.  We saw that.  Sounds disgusting.  The Red Eye Grill.  Would you like some meat?  The food is excellent at the Red Eye Grill.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  But it's like the Red Eye Grill, home of the dancing shrimp, they call it.  Which, red eye and a dancing shrimp just sounds too perverted.  I hear you get the horse gag in there, and it's just awful, and cream sauce thing.  They serve you ten shrimps, like, on a string, like beads.  Put him in the red eye and hug him out like you're starting a lawnmower.  Oh, man.  It's different than the dancing shrimp.  What, we've gone too far, Jim?  No, that was it.  Was it a little too far there?  We wanked crazy.  I'm Christian.  Okay.  Hey, Rich, what's going on? 
[01:41:30]  Yo, Ant.  Oh.  Yo.  Ant, I know you're the big consummate, you know, stock man.  But, Jim, you got any good tips?  I mean, you got, you know, two of the richest ballplayers in the world next to you.  Yeah, you do those stock commercials, Jim.  Any tips for us?  Tips.  Stay in school.  You know, what's the inside line?  Stay in school.  Tips on what?  Like batting?  No, stocks, man.  Come on.  Oh, stocks.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know.  Are you trying to tell us you're playing a role for this commercial?  We thought you were an expert at stocks.  Well, that's the first thing is I wanted to ask some professional baseball players about 
[01:42:00]  stock tips.  I mean, you keep on peeking over their shoulder.  See, I don't get the whole thing.  I'm actually, I'm looking, I'm looking over their shoulder because both of them have nipple  rings.  So you, no, I, uh, yeah.  See, the thing is.  I'm good on the radio.  The thing is, you're there as a character.  You're not Jim Gaffigan on that commercial.  But the ballplayers are real ballplayers.  They are.  So I don't get the mixture of the two.  Is it Jim Gaffigan doing stocks online? 
[01:42:30]  Have you done that?  Have you traded stocks online?  I have not traded stocks online.  Oh, it's beautiful.  You lose money without even seeing a president's face.  I've lost a lot of money.  He just, he just fit the suit for the commercial.  See?  The Johnny Bravo syndrome.  You fit the suit.  Blue Star Airlines, dude.  Blue Star Airlines.  Blue, is that your stock tip?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, oh.  Where'd you get that info, Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just know?  Yeah.  Blue Star.  Everyone has a stock tip.  Yeah.  Ooh, an airline stock.  Like, it isn't a good buy opportunity right now. 
[01:43:00]  Here's a stock tip.  Don't invest in the market.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  This guy, Jim, sounds like Eeyore after he smoked three joints.  That's right.  Thank you.  Take it, Eeyore.  All right.  You got a question.  All right.  We'll take it, Eeyore.  Let's smoke a bowl or two, Eeyore.  Because I'm so low energy.  All right.  I got some hash honey, Eeyore.  Let's eat it and get stoned.  All right.  Jim Gaffigan in the studio.  He's all right, though.  We'll pop him up a little bit.  He's on Ellen.  And you got some comedy dates, too, right? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to be at Caroline's this week.  And I don't know exactly when.  So just stop in every day.  You got to take it at 7.30 and then Thursday at 8 and then Saturday at 8.  You got to take plug tips from Jim Norton.  Yeah.  He can show you how to plug a gig.  Yeah, you plug it.  Dude, I can show you how to plug really sneaky and still get no one.  I couldn't draw flies to an Arab ice.  I stink.  More with Jim Gaffigan in just a bit. 
[01:44:00]  I'm looking for toilet training books.  Everybody poops is still the standard, of course.  We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You.  See, where can we?  No way.  Oh, then you want your a noby child and that concentrated evil coming out the back of you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I need to go poopies!  Hey, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Disturbed, down with the sickness.  Hi, Rob.  Jim Gaffigan in the studio. 
[01:44:30]  Jim, are you down with the sickness there or what?  I've got Anthrax.  Anthrax.  Speaking of which, why don't you play Anthrax?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How's Anthrax doing?  Are they selling?  Psyched about this.  They got to be like, man, our name's all over, man.  You know, unfortunately, now there's going to be definitely a rap band called The Taliban.  The Taliban.  Yeah, on Def G Records.  The Taliban.  The Taliban are some OGs.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on? 
[01:45:00]  Hey, O&A.  What's up?  Not much.  Hey, Norton, I got your obscure reference on Simmons Freeway.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I think you've stolen a crown from Dennis Miller as far as obscure references.  Actually, it's the first thing I thought of when you, if you've seen the horse footage,  the horse finishes.  Yeah, back and to the left, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And the lady goes, and it just reminded me of a bullet hitting it.  Yeah, it was a JFK reference.  And, of course, the other reference, Frank.  Frank, yeah.  Yo, guys.  Hey.  He pulled it on, you guys.  Yep. 
[01:45:30]  He did.  Wall Street.  Blue Star Airlines.  Jim should have picked that one up.  Right, Gaffigan, what's wrong with you?  I'm Tony Blair, and I support him.  Good way.  Good going, Norton.  Good going.  I support him totally.  There's a vacuum of inverbal peace pill.  I'm part of a decaying empire.  Isn't that great?  You've got to love the Tony Blair.  He's our staunch ally.  Wouldn't you want a drink with that guy?  Well, I wouldn't want to see him without a shirt on. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, pasty English.  Oh, dear.  They are so, like, behind us.  It's always the English right there.  We were talking during break, and it was like, George Bush could get up there and go,  look, we had to bomb London.  I'll explain it in a week.  I can't even tell you why we did it right now.  But we have bombed London.  Here's Tony Blair.  He has an awesome opportunity for a fantastic speech.  The reason they bombed us is very quite simply a measure of impropitude. 
[01:46:30]  We are using our own troops now to continue the bombing of London.  We are part of the attacking Afghanistan.  We are contributing the napkins.  We're contributing the napkins and the stewardesses.  You see, the English contributed the submarine. 
[01:47:00]  They had a submarine that they said launched some cruise missiles.  How do we know?  I love how do we know?  I love how the Germans were like, hey, we'll give you troops.  And everyone's like, oh, that's okay.  Why don't you guys sit back a little bit?  They are so eager to blitzkrieg their way into some battle these days.  Would you like us to go into Croatia?  No, that's okay.  Croatia is a Catholic.  There's Muslims near there.  We know some neighborhoods much better than others. 
[01:47:30]  We would be happy to go in.  And the Italians are finally on the right side at the beginning of a war.  Oh, all right, we'll go with the Europeans.  And I guess we're European.  The Germans were so happy and eager.  We will stand behind the Americans.  They're ready for a big rally in Nuremberg or something.  Get a few people.  We're so excited.  Goose step their way across another continent.  What the hell?  Then they bomb London. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, Afghanistan.  We will send our buzz bombs.  Buzz bombs?  We've already invaded France to settle it.  But we didn't ask you to.  Oops.  We're already there.  They're here.  So we've invaded our operation here.  You're like, we don't care.  The crying guy by the arch is crying again.  Oh, that's so...  Oh, they battle them with tears.  The French.  Oh, this is horrible.  Oh, there's wine over here.  They were so happy. 
[01:48:30]  And the Japanese also said, you know, oh, well, we'll send our navy.  Do they even have anything anymore?  Yes.  There's a guy named Nomasaki.  Nomasaki.  Just one guy.  That's the navy.  One guy.  They're a robo.  Great.  Yeah, with a craft that rivals what Cubans float over here on, I'm sure.  It's a...  Yeah, one of those junks or something.  I love who's involved in this. 
[01:49:00]  It's like, none of the players we really need.  Like, Saudi Arabia and stuff?  I know.  They're just sitting there going, all right, we're not going to support it, but we...  You know, if you're here, we're not going to kill you.  Oh, thanks.  Well, it's so funny.  It's like 10 years ago, Saudi Arabia's like,  Iraq's going to come and kill us.  Come again.  Help us.  Help us.  And then we go in there, and then we're there.  We have a military base there, and Saudi Arabia's like,  geez, I don't know what we should do.  Yeah.  Can we use the base we built?  Maybe you guys shouldn't use that army base. 
[01:49:30]  It's 10 feet from where you need it.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's a good idea.  And then other countries, it's like, gee, thanks.  You know, you got, hey, it's Australia.  You could use us.  Oh, great.  Thank you.  There's a closer one on the moon.  I think we'll be using that one, which is a little closer than the Aussie base.  We're not getting the help, but we need it right there.  Do you see the B-1 bombers have to fly from Missouri?  That's a little bit of a trick.  You want the guys to take off, psyched up, drop their bombs, celebrate on the plane, come back. 
[01:50:00]  You don't want to flight like they're going out to L.A. for the Grammys or something.  That's the time they get there.  You take off, they're all, ooh, ooh, let's kick some ass.  We got our bombs.  We're going to go.  Two hours later, it's like, you got any jacks?  I don't know.  What do you got?  They're ready to drop bombs.  Are we there now?  And justice for all again?  Play master of puppets at least.  I only brought one CD.  You know, we got all psyched up.  It's like when you take that road trip and you only brought one CD. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, it's over again.  Hey, guys, I got the new Leonard Cohen.  What?  Right.  You know, if we had, our base is a little closer to the action.  But no one wants to help out.  It's our fault for helping them, you know.  Mind our bit.  Look, when you're in the wild and you see two gorillas slugging it out,  you don't step in.  You just let them fight, let the stronger one win.  That's the way it should be with these countries.  Except for England.  Well, you know what's amazing?  It's like if England was in trouble, you know that like George Bush would have been, 
[01:51:00]  hey, wow, that's a bummer for you guys.  What's that, an island somewhere?  Some kind of island.  It's like we're joking around about this.  The war's probably gone three levels higher and we're like,  yeah, England, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know.  It's probably so completely inappropriate.  I know.  What do we know?  We're just a-holes.  But, you know, now troops have moved up Panama.  It's like England's supporting us. 
[01:51:30]  It's like, you know, I'm like Irish-American.  I'm like, ah, you guys can have Northern Ireland.  Thanks for supporting us.  You're ready to give it away.  It's like, yeah, Russia, you can have chess.  Yeah, I don't care.  You're good.  You see what these Russians are doing now?  They're massing on a border so when the opportunity arises, they can go into Kabul and be like, hey, we won!  We won the war, comrade!  That's what they did in Japan.  They did the same thing in Germany.  They did it in Japan. 
[01:52:00]  They did it recently in, I believe, Bosnia.  Yeah.  The same thing.  It's like-  Oh, Kosovo.  Yeah, they just sit back and wait for everyone else to do it and then run in.  Hey!  You know, how much crap did we go through?  What's going on, guys?  How much crap did we go through in World War II to get across the Rhine and just start pounding Berlin?  And they strolled right in.  Hey, we won!  You were on their side for a while, you bastards!  They strolled in like they won!  A toast to you. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, you have no arms.  You've been fighting.  Yeah.  So they're ready to run in now and finish a war that they lost a decade ago.  And we just got to sit there because they're helping.  We'll help.  Like the guys that wait on the side in a fight until the guy's down and then jump in and start hitting them.  What?  I helped.  I had your back.  I was right there with you, man.  I was with you.  We'll send the Kursk.  Did we miss the party?  What happened?  We were right there.  The poor submarine that went down was named the Kursk. 
[01:53:00]  It was the Kursk with a K on it.  No wonder it's saying.  What a good vessel.  Jeff, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm going to go on the SS broken piece of crap.  What's up, Jeff?  Not the two or two.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Jim Gaffigan's on TV as we speak.  Hey, look at that.  It's Jim Gaffigan.  You're talking to No More Garcia Parra.  It's Fleet Homelink.  I use the Fleet Homelink. 
[01:53:30]  And there's Derek Cheater.  And there's Derek Cheater.  Hey, you're not wearing your Alaska hat on TV, though.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Do you do your banking on Fleet Homelink?  I support Fleet Homelink.  I support Fleet Homelink.  And it's wonderful.  Wow, we're talking to a guy that's on TV.  I totally support Fleet Homelink.  All right.  In England.  Jeff, what's up?  Not the two or three, but, you know, can you just picture this guy sitting back saying,  Oh, aren't you?  You know?  Oh, aren't you? 
[01:54:00]  It's C-3-P-L.  I need a better whistle for R-2-B-2.  Well, you know what was so funny is also Great Britain was like, they're like, we are totally  behind the Americans in their war on terror.  And the CIA came out and said, the Pentagon was like, yeah, we might have to go out and  do another country.  The English were like, well, hold on now.  No, wait a minute.  Hold on.  We don't want this to get messy.  My goodness, R-2.  This is getting serious.  Let's get Maggie Thatcher over here to help us. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, Maggie, you're here.  Tom Brokaw.  I will destroy you.  Oh, my, R-2, look.  We have to get involved.  I'll give a speech.  That's what I'll do.  And then I got to use my bad whistle.  Can someone get me a better slide whistle?  I can't do R-2-D-2 anymore.  I used to have the best slide whistle.  Someone stole it. 
[01:55:00]  If you were the real R-2, you wouldn't need the slide whistle.  I know.  Oh, dear.  Steve, what's going on, bro?  Hey, man.  I just had to call and tell you.  I mean, you guys are always funny, but this stuff is absolutely friggin' off the charts,  man.  Oh, war.  It's hysterical.  War.  Thanks for a laugh, guys.  War, always funny.  Just nutty and insane, man.  All right, Steve.  It's Jim Gaffigan.  He's in the studio.  He's on that new show, Ellen, by the way.  Yeah.  Is anyone watching that show? 
[01:55:30]  Hello?  Not all at once.  Man.  Man, it's on Friday.  It's far in the morning.  We support Ellen in her new show.  We totally support Ellen.  Let's all be honest.  How many people in the studio?  There's about 12 guys have seen Ellen.  I have not seen the new Ellen show.  Well, I would say that the O&A audience is the same demographic as the Ellen.  Nice.  Yes.  Okay.  Give me a little background.  Was it preempted for a war report, maybe? 
[01:56:00]  I don't know.  No.  It's doing all right.  Friday night at 8 o'clock.  Who's home?  Hey, that was the coveted spot for the Brady Bunch.  That's right.  It's true.  When we were 10.  Jim, did the interns hate going out to get her to lunch?  Like, oh, tacos again, huh?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  A nice subtle vag joke.  What do you mean by tacos?  Jim, we have the same demo as you. 
[01:56:30]  We're both into lesbians.  The Ellen show and the O&A show.  Oh, yeah.  What's your role on Ellen?  Oh, yeah.  What part do you play on that?  It's a very interesting part.  I actually play Ellen on the show.  Are you Ellen?  That's interesting.  No, I play Ellen's...  What, did you put it to femmer up a little bit?  Hey, that's an insult against me, Ian.  No, see, it wasn't meant to be.  It was a double-pronged assault.  We terribly support the Ellen show. 
[01:57:00]  The collaborative damage of that joke took Jim Gaffigan.  It wasn't meant to.  We are going to gather a bunch of Muppet people in a building and discuss the Americans' right  to do this until it gets messy.  Oh, shoot.  Our country is filled with a million Muslims.  Take it back.  Take it back.  Like, one in five people in Great Britain are Muslim.  They're like, how did that happen?  Should we have said that?  There were riots in northern England between the Azeans, as we call it. 
[01:57:30]  You rock, man.  I play Ellen's high school boyfriend.  Oh, boyfriend.  And she's gay on the show.  Oh, so you turned her gay.  My character turned her gay.  No, I mean.  I think I did.  That's the old thing that you're the boyfriend.  I'm the old boyfriend.  Because we're friends.  That's so realistic.  Because we're friends.  Lesbians can be friends with straight men.  Is that it? 
[01:58:00]  Is that the only reason you're still...  Because I know myself, I don't even like seeing old girlfriends or anything like that.  It's just like, get away.  You ever see Ellen kissing like another girl in between scenes and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Happens all the time.  Is she hot and stuff?  Craft service chicks, whatever, man.  Oh, yeah.  No, she's got a girlfriend.  Her girlfriend's beautiful.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Because she had that Anne Heche girl before that.  You mean Celestia?  Celestia.  Celestia. 
[01:58:30]  Celestia.  We'd support Celestia.  Which makes me wonder...  Teddy Blah.  Celestia, I hear, is opening up all of her air bases for the U.S. Air Force, which is  great for Celestia.  Another planet.  But, you know, it makes me think that Ellen's choice in women, a little weird.  You know, if you've got a chick that's that spaced out...  Yeah.  ...you know what I mean?  Literally.  How's her girlfriend now?  Is she a normal girl?  Her girlfriend seems really nice.  Really?  I don't like, you know, eat lunch with them every day. 
[01:59:00]  That's why I think Ellen is a lot more like a man than a lot of guys or like a lot of  women.  She is really like lesbian.  Because she looked at the way Anne Heche looked in her bod and thought, I'm going to rail  this chick.  I don't care how crazy she is.  You know, us guys think like that.  It's a hot chick.  You're not thinking...  I don't care.  She can have all kinds of baggage, whatever.  Who cares?  She's hot.  She doesn't know English.  We can deal with that.  Ellen's thinking the same thing.  She thinks she's in space, but look at those cans and her ass. 
[01:59:30]  No, really, what you're saying is we're all the same.  We're all the same.  Men and dykes are the same.  And we support England.  England.  I love it.  I support the lesbian.  We should just bomb Iran.  You want to do that?  No, I'm liking the Iran.  We've got to go for Iraq.  Iran's trying to figure out how to support us.  Iran's the little powder keg.  So we'll just wait a year until they're terrorists.  True.  Well, they were.  Remember them?  They were the enemy back in the 79.  Do you, I mean, it's not like they're not burning effigies of the president every other 
[02:00:00]  weekend still.  Yeah.  Right, right.  I loved that.  Seeing that last night on the news, the guys that decided that the American flag wasn't  flammable enough, so they dipped it in some gasoline, lit it on fire, and it turned into  a Three Stooges sketch where, like, one of these Muslim retards are on fire running through  the streets with this American flag blazing behind them.  And I'm just like, there's a way to show you hate America.  Yeah, kill yourself.  That big beard just in flames on his face, like Grizzly Adams when he did that flaming 
[02:00:30]  shot years ago.  Man, man, come on.  Brr, put me out!  Brr, take the towel off, man.  The fire department would put you out, but they're consumed with a blaze that we started  with.  The bowing equipment.  Towel sales are really going to go down.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Real good.  Jim Gaffigan in the studio, killing today.  Yeah, I got two things real quick.  Jim, did Nomar try to poke you in the butt when you did the commercial with him? 
[02:01:00]  With a stick.  Yes, he did.  No, no, he didn't.  Why would he?  Second thing, I want to know what, you know, I was watching CNN and Canada's on.  They're sending all these ships over.  Are they, like, cheering people on with pom-poms and stuff?  In Canada?  Yeah, no.  They're sending warships over there.  You know, what the hell are they going to do?  Are they trying to say Canada is the waterborne of the war?  Yeah, more or less, you know.  Canada has sent one-fifth of their military, both guys.  Both of them?  Wow.  They are supporting us.  It's a country of 200. 
[02:01:30]  They're really scared of those guys on the horses with the red suits and the big hats.  I'll get him.  Dudley and Dorite here.  We're halfway across the Atlantic.  He recognizes me from the show North and South.  Now, thank God we have these allies, huh?  Have they tied a woman to the train tracks yet?  I'll get her.  Uh-uh.  Looking for some guy with a big curly mustache.  I hope there's no fur trading going on here. 
[02:02:00]  My goodness, they're poaching beaver pouch.  I smell some beaver.  The Canadian Army, where the hell do you see them?  Do you guys mind if we go fly fishing for a bit?  We totally support the fly fishing of the Canadians.  The Canadians should be able to fly fish.  Do you feel like Tony Blair kind of sleeps in a coat and tie?  I will sleep in a tie in case eloquence is needed in a moment's notice. 
[02:02:30]  Bolts up out of bed.  Hello, Tony Blair here for another speech.  Tony Blair playing the role of Winston Churchill.  Only much thinner.  Do people think I'm like Churchill?  You know he wants that so bad.  That's not what Tony Blair can do for you.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Why am I doing Kennedy's speeches? 
[02:03:00]  What's up, Jeremy?  Hey, y'all speak in front of Tony Blair and all, and I think it's great, but they're really  the only ones helping right now, right?  Yeah, I know.  That's why.  No.  Thank God.  Hey, I got one more thing for you.  All right.  Where'd he go?  Hello.  He did the...  Ah, you hung up.  Yes.  That wasn't very British of him.  Hey, Jim, you also took a dump on Sex and the City.  I did take a dump.  You were the dump guy.  I was the pooper.  He dumped on Sex and the City, the pooper.  Yes, I took a dump. 
[02:03:30]  That's impressive, right?  That was method.  I have gone to the bathroom before.  That was method acting?  And I am...  You left the door open, you were taking a dump, and it smelled real bad.  Yes, those were sound effects.  Oh, they were?  Yeah, I mean, I taped them earlier.  They were you, but on delay.  Yes, I have taken a...  I was known as the dumper.  Yeah.  I pooed in an episode.  Do you do that, though, in front of girls really?  Is that something?  Well, Jim will agree with you there.  We can hang with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Got to get the glass table, or it's Norton the dignity saver. 
[02:04:00]  Norton wakes up.  Wait a minute.  The Cleveland Steve.  That's my show.  Well, you can enjoy the view without the whole mess, and, you know, just enjoy and do a little  bag-whacking under the table.  Could you get that Cosmopolitan magazine out of the way?  Well, with that, we've got to take a break.  That's awful.  Jim Gaffigan's going to be at Caroline's Wednesday, Thursday.  I totally support Caroline's Saturday.  And Saturday.  Very funny guy. 
[02:04:30]  I saw you with Brian Regan.  It was one of the best shows I saw ever seen at Caroline's.  Oh, thank you.  And you're hanging, I guess?  I mean, you can do whatever you want.  Yeah, I'm going to stay here forever.  Cool.  All right, good.  Jeff Probst calling in next, Anthony.  Ah, the pussy that doesn't want to fly.  Yeah.  From Survivor, of course.  The new Survivor starts Thursday.  Mm-hmm.  And we'll talk to Jeff next.  Something's crazy happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants? 
[02:05:00]  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess what's in teen pants.  1027 WNEW.  You're bringing your ass back to the greatest city on Earth.  It's Ron and Fez with New York Forever.  Take a TV tour of New York and see some of the buildings made famous on television.  Call on-location tours at 212-825-3896.  And check out some of the locations from Different Strokes, Cosby, and the Jeffersons. 
[02:05:30]  Can you see any white TV shows?  What you talking about, Willis?  We're Ron and Fez for New York Forever on 1027 WNEW.  Jim, if you don't mind, we've got to sell some water right now.  Water.  It's O2Go.  O2Go.  It's oxygenated distilled water.  Have you heard about this?  Have you heard of water?  Heard of it.  It's O2Go.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is this that water that has oxygen in it?  Yes.  See?  Not like that other water that does it. 
[02:06:00]  Well, all water has some oxygen in it.  You're talking five times the oxygen in this water.  Wow.  Yes, O2Go.  And you don't get less water.  No, it's not like that half filled with air and half filled with water.  They just shoved that oxygen in there somehow.  That would suck.  But this is...  Could you imagine her look on her face when you're three inches...  No, there's a different commercial.  That was the other commercial.  There's more oxygen in it.  O2Go, it's oxygenated water.  You will lose oxygen, though, if you're getting three inches bigger.  I hear Tony Blair loves O2Go. 
[02:06:30]  We totally support the oxygenated water.  Okay, get it where you get water.  It's O2Go.  O2Go.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is...  This station.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  In the studio, Jim Gaffin, a very funny guy.  Oh, yeah.  He's on the new Ellen show called Ellen, I believe. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  It's on a very special West Wing.  It's on, I don't know, Friday nights or something.  A very special propaganda-heavy West Wing.  This week, they deal with the issue of racism being bad.  Wow, going out on a limb.  That is too much.  Martin Sheen...  It's so bad to hate people because they look different from me.  Martin Sheen is just...  I cannot stand that man.  I liked him in Apocalypse Now.  And then after that, it was like every two seconds, you'd see him protesting something. 
[02:07:30]  When you're as rich as me.  He would be there.  That show should be called Left Wind.  And go back to your mansion.  Hi, I'm Martin Sheen.  I'm here breaking open a nuclear missile silo with a crowbar.  And you're like, what?  He is.  And then they haul him away.  And the next week, he's out, you know.  Hi, I'm Martin Sheen in South America to protest logging.  He's like, wait, weren't you just in jail for the missile thing?  It's like a bunch of Martin Sheens, like Rip Winston, like, yabba-dabba-doo. 
[02:08:00]  Walking around.  I'm Martin Sheen against shoes.  Celebrities against shoes.  Shoes step on bugs.  We need bugs.  And Martin, you're going to look at...  And visit Ireland.  I'm Martin Sheen for celebrities with drug and sex-addicted children.  Oh, wait a minute.  But now that he's back on TV, he's not protesting anymore.  Because he thinks he's the president now.  He walks around.  He's on a show.  He plays the president.  He thinks he's the president. 
[02:08:30]  I guess it wouldn't be smart for the president to be protesting.  I guess not.  Maybe that's a good thing.  Keep him in there.  Keeps him off the streets.  In a very special Westway.  Martin Sheen against undercooked food.  I support Martin Sheen.  You know, I'm surprised.  You know, we've got England as our allies, right?  Or Great Britain, which is just England and other places they've conquered.  Oh, God. 
[02:09:00]  Great Britain.  And we've got, like, everyone else is like, oh, yeah, we're with you.  You know, oh, you guys already started?  Because we could have sent somebody, you know?  We could have helped you, but we didn't know you were doing it right now.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like, so we've got Great Britain and, like, SeaWorld just supporting us.  I'm a man of the other.  Thank God there wasn't much there in Afghanistan, you know?  Because we had that whole coalition that they put together for Iraq. 
[02:09:30]  And it was just, you know, every country really was a little more into it, into that thing.  Because it was Iraq invading Kuwait, so we all had to get together and show them that, no, you can't do that.  But this time, it's, yeah, England and us.  Why didn't we just get rid?  You know, I don't understand why we didn't get rid of Saddam.  It's like, yeah, you know, Bush was like, we got the new, this guy's a Hitler.  And then they're like, oh, you know what?  Actually, our thinking now is we should leave the Hitler in power.  You know what I mean? 
[02:10:00]  It's like, why would we do that?  You know why?  I'll totally tell you why.  He was too into things like Batman, Superman.  You never kill the evil villain.  You just pound him into submission so he can later come back.  Well, wasn't it?  And steal the weather.  Right.  With my weather machine, I'll destroy the world.  You know?  Wasn't it the Saudis were like, yeah, it's okay if you kick their butt, but don't invade another country.  Yeah, hey, hey, we didn't sign up for that. 
[02:10:30]  Don't invade.  Bomb them.  That's fine.  But you got to leave them in there so they can come back like the Joker.  That's it.  We quit.  Nice 20 megaton bomb would settle all our problems.  Well, it would.  Just stick clothing to skin and leave shadows on the wall.  I'm so tired of them.  They've contributed nothing.  They've invented nothing.  You really hung up on this inventing.  Yeah, but I'm saying they contributed to the world medically or culturally.  They invented the magic carpet.  Hello?  And opium. 
[02:11:00]  All right, opium.  They give us the opium.  I stand corrected.  The magic carpet.  The magic carpet.  And the shoes that curl at the end.  Norton, there's a great invention.  It's sweeping the nation.  If you see people, what is Uruguay invented?  We're not bombing them.  Well, we should.  But those shoes can't find the G-spot.  They're like, the infidels. 
[02:11:30]  Those Americans are infidels.  Give me one of my 10 wives.  You know what I mean?  At what definition, infidels?  You know what I mean?  Give me my 13-year-old third wife.  We're the sinners.  That's what Osama said.  We're the sinners, and they're the faithful.  And it's the battle between the faithful and the sinners.  But like you said, he's got his 13-year-old, one of his 13-year-old wives.  What type of God do you pray to?  Already knocked up.  This multi-headed thing that, you know, you just do whatever you need. 
[02:12:00]  You speak to a certain head for this.  And you rub the belly for that.  It's just not what it is.  The 13-year-old thing, though, you've got to respect that.  I don't like him at all, but that choice I'll respect.  Oh, my God.  Might want to keep that thought to yourself, Jim.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you, man?  All right.  Hey, actually, thinking about the Canadian Army, did you guys know that they actually helped form our special forces? 
[02:12:30]  Yes, I did know that.  You did that?  They helped form our special forces.  Well, they actually helped.  They were part of a joint American-Canadian force in World War II.  No, that's not exactly it.  No, no, no.  It's close to it, but they actually...  Actually, in World War II, they were still the Royal Army.  Yes.  Yes, yes.  And we totally support them.  All right, Kyle.  No, but, you know, we're joking.  Obviously, we appreciate the support of James. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, I know you guys.  You know what I mean?  Can I admit that I was lying to the north?  I mean, we appreciate the real Canadians, not those French Canadians.  All right, Kyle, thank you.  Celine Dion.  Even though when I come back from Canada, I just throw the money away, that worthless scrap.  I'm trying to buy Park Place or, like, the electric railroad.  Didn't I give you a lot of money?  I didn't know that, by the way.  I lied.  Hey, we have to interrupt Jim Gaffigan because a TV star is calling in. 
[02:13:30]  Jeff Propes?  Mr. Propes?  Hey, I just wanted to call in and say congratulations to you guys on you're now all over the damn country.  Wow.  Thank you, Jeff.  Nothing like Jeff.  And we wanted to just call you a pussy.  Thank you.  Hey, Jeff, why aren't you here in New York?  Oh, you know...  I'm afraid to fly.  I'm afraid to fly.  We're here and you're scared to fly still, Jeff.  No, actually, it was just a good way to get out of having to travel. 
[02:14:00]  No, I came back from...  I was out of town and I got back Sunday night and kind of had all these messages saying,  hey, you know.  It wasn't the flying.  It was that everybody kept saying something was going to happen and I wanted to be home.  Oh, you were the guy that hung out the helicopter door on the last season.  Last season of Survivor.  And you thought something was going to happen so you wanted to stay home.  That and the fact that I've been traveling so much, I thought maybe I could parlay this into a little... 
[02:14:30]  Well, Jeff, what if our military said something may happen and we'll just stay home?  Put stripes on my arm and I'll be on that damn plane.  All right, he makes a point.  What's the matter?  I didn't have time to put the makeup on before the flight, Nancy boy?  You know what?  Right now, I got my feet up.  The Mariner game is on the two.  I'm a happy MF-er.  Okay.  Hey, MF-er.  Hey, who's winning that game there, Jeff?  Well, Cleveland's up.  Hey, wait a minute, Jeff.  Do you have your feet up?  Let's get those feet down. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  I don't think you should be resting comfortably when our soldiers are fighting a war.  Maybe you should put your feet down and maybe even let them fall asleep a little bit.  Jeff, you better still have a tie on.  I'm wearing red, white, and blue underwear.  All right.  What's the score?  It's four zip, Cleveland.  Nice.  Nice.  I'm an M's fan.  They stink.  MF.  They cheat.  MF.  MF.  I'm catching a little vibe here. 
[02:15:30]  I have a feeling Ellen is not on CBS like Survivor is, Anthony.  Ellen is on CBS.  Oh, okay.  It is.  And Jeff, I don't know if you know this.  My name is Dan Rather.  And we've met before.  And courage.  Courage.  Courage.  We've met.  I don't know if you've met at one of those parties.  Yeah, get to the point.  Oh, gee.  Hey, come on.  I can throw it back a little.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, MF. 
[02:16:00]  Jeff, actually, this is going to be embarrassing.  This is actually Alicia Keys.  And she's just as hot in person.  She is just as gorgeous in person.  Is she hot?  I'm saying you.  Well, you know, my singing voice is different.  Right.  I just had my, uh, yeah.  So, Mr. Probst?  Yeah.  Survivor, Thursday night?  Thursday night at 8. 
[02:16:30]  In Africa.  In Africa.  And I've got to say, all jokes aside, it's pretty damn good.  Yeah?  Yeah, I just saw the first episode, and it's, uh, you know, and I was there, and still I  look at this thing and go, damn, this, I love these people.  They're so bitchy right from the beginning.  Jeff, I've got to ask you something, though.  Yeah?  Uh, and you've probably been asked this a lot, uh, uh, the whole thing with reality television.  Right.  It seems to me like people have other things on their minds right about now, and, uh, are  they really going to be into watching, uh, the whole Survivor thing? 
[02:17:00]  You know, I don't know.  I mean, I really don't.  I, I only know for me that, you know, like, like you guys, I mean, I lived in New York,  I have friends in New York, I'm as concerned about New York, and now with everything in  our country and the world, and...  Where are you right now?  I'm in L.A.  All right, thank you.  You've got your feet up, right?  But you know where I'm sitting at.  With your feet up, right?  Feet up in L.A.  Yeah.  We're wondering when the next plane, we're wondering when the next plane is coming, and  he's, uh, yeah.  He's got his feet up in L.A.  I am worried sick about you guys.  I said the crust off the bed.  Hey, all I was going to say is that if there's something more pressing going on, I, like everybody 
[02:17:30]  else, going to be watching that and not Survivor.  If there's a time where, just like checking out your guys' show, there's a time when  you want a diversion, you want some entertaining distractions.  And that's when you leave our show?  No.  I really, I honestly think that.  I think there are times when you want to tune in and listen to you guys because it's something  different.  I got you.  Now, we heard a rumor that Alicia Keys is on this Survivor.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Within that rule.  It is true. 
[02:18:00]  Aren't you so glad you guys didn't choose Afghanistan as your location?  Because that would be Survivor, Afghanistan.  Imagine that.  Bombs falling there going, oh, no, who's going to get the food and win the challenge?  They were talking about the Middle East for the next one, though, right?  But they canceled that, huh?  Yeah.  It was on our docket of things.  The place that we were considering was Jordan.  Jordan.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, she sounds hot.  Hey, Jeff, is this Survivor any different than the other two?  Now, Jerry, are you still going out with Jerry? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  I never.  I can't figure out if she started that story or what.  How many members of Survivor did you bang, Jeff?  In the last one?  In the last one.  How about overall?  Wow.  Yeah.  Give us a running tally.  You did that gray-haired lady.  I know that.  Overall.  What was her name?  Chief or something like that.  What was her name?  Sarge.  Mad Dog.  Mad Dog.  Mad Dog.  Did you see the Mad Dog when it pulled out her teeth?  Come on.  Nice.  You got a good gumming, right?  Come on.  Jeff called her Mad Doggy style is the way he referred to her after their night alone. 
[02:19:00]  I called her a Mad Dog MF-er.  The MF-er again.  Hey, Jeff, did you sleep with Jerry?  No.  No?  No.  Now, you slept with Jervis, right?  Yeah.  And you know what?  I'm open to experimentation, so.  There you go.  Do they call him for the host of a great show?  No.  You can do it once.  Do you see?  Are there any?  Wait, what was that?  Are there some stars on this?  I just got dogged and I missed it.  No, no.  It's an old BJ, Joe.  Are there some stars on Survivor Africa? 
[02:19:30]  Is there another, you know, Jervis?  You know, is there, I mean, is VH1 going to get a couple more DJs or...  Yeah, really?  Yeah, there's some good people on there.  Yeah, what do we got?  Who's standing out this season?  You got some hot girls?  Yeah, there's a hot Latino chick, right?  Is there?  A Latina?  Yes.  Got one of those?  How many?  Puerto Rican.  Puerto Rican, nice. 
[02:20:00]  And she's from Orlando and she is hot.  Is she going to be in a 7-Up commercial or...  What's that?  What does a Puerto Rican girl do on Survivor?  They get her a job and if she can show up all week?  All right, Norton.  Oh, my gosh.  Jeff, now you've crossed the line.  We have to apologize for Jim Norton.  He's not right ever since he got the anthrax.  Hey, I don't want you guys to take this personally, but if I suddenly go dead, my phone, this battery 
[02:20:30]  is beeping, so just know that.  Why don't you kick your feet off that stoop and plug the phone in?  It's so far from the beverage to charge the phone up or pick up a landline or something.  All right, all right, bite me, bite me.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm out.  He's on speaker.  There you go.  Oh, he's on speaker.  All right, you're on the speaker now.  Now I can look at internet porn at the same time.  Hey, what's your favorite internet porn, Jeff?  You like horse gag?  Oh, I haven't tried that.  That's a great one. 
[02:21:00]  No, horse gag's great.  We can send it to you if you want to give us your email address.  Now, Jeff.  I'll give you that off the air.  Yeah.  All right, what else about Survivor?  What's different about this Survivor than the other two?  I think because we...  They got another stupid Texan that's going to allow someone else to win the money?  Let me tell you, Colby does just fine.  You go out with Colby and he's not hurting at all.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Good cheese.  Good cheese.  That was such a stupid move, though.  Yeah, he doesn't...  I don't know.  He seems to not regret it. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, love the speakerphone, Jeff.  Now, when Survivor did the Hollywood Squares, Jeff, were you in the middle square?  Square, unfortunately.  That's great, Jeff.  We got you on the speaker now, too.  Isn't that good?  It's not a day, man.  I've been on the phone all day.  I don't want to get that phone.  You're going to get that phone.  Jeff, where in Africa was it?  It was from Kenya. 
[02:22:00]  Kenya.  And it was 100,000 acres of, you know, lions and elephants and zebras.  Yeah.  Did you see any natives?  Yeah.  We involved the Sembru tribe guys a lot, actually.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  Now, are they good natives or are they ones that wear the jeans and the T-shirt?  I hate that.  When I turn on the Discovery Channel and it's an Africa thing and they're wearing, like,  Levi's and shirts, I like them either completely naked or with, like, some animal pelt on them.  I like them wearing the big hollow stick. 
[02:22:30]  The big hollow stick or the women feeding two little infants with a big range around their neck.  That's not a big...  That's not a big...  That's not a big...  That's not a big...  That's not a big...  That's not a big...  Danger.  Danger.  Danger.  Back up.  Back up.  Don't talk about topic like that.  That's not the Discovery Channel.  That's a WB sitcom.  Now, Lewis Gaffigan.  Danger.  What the hell's wrong with you, Gaffigan?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was not me.  That was not...  Jim Norton had to push it to the edge. 
[02:23:00]  All right, Jeff, I apologize for Jim Norton.  I was fine because all I was doing was talking about shows I had seen on the Discovery Channel.  You have never seen the stick people on the Discovery Channel?  They are great.  They wear three or four foot sticks on their unit.  On their unit.  And the guy walks around and he could run through the jungle and shoot a monkey out of a tree with a blowgun  while he's got this big thing on his schwance.  That's these guys.  They dress in all the tribal wear and they've got piercing starch for them at like 12 or 13.  And it's, you know, it's a sign of beautification. 
[02:23:30]  So they got it all.  They got things everywhere.  Beautification.  Jeff, is it true you stretched your neck to, you know, feel like one with the...  Did you get the big, long two-foot neck?  Do they wear those rings around their head?  Yeah, that's how they push the neck up.  Or, uh, I also heard that Jeff now has big plates in his lips.  Jeff, do you have that?  I've got a big plate, but it ain't in my lips.  It's in his head.  Hey, MF.  Alicia Keys getting out of hand over here tonight. 
[02:24:00]  Where's the next one?  The next survivor?  No, it's going to be somewhere fun, actually.  They haven't said for sure yet.  Oh, so you don't think Africa's fun?  Is that what you're saying, Jeff?  Well, Africa was tough because there's, uh...  Diseases like Ebola virus.  You should have it in the American Media Building.  Oh, God.  You are awful.  Jeff?  Africa's got a few problems over there, but it was definitely tough for the survivors just because there's no water. 
[02:24:30]  Did you get the runs or anything?  Everybody had the runs, and there's nowhere to go clean off.  Did you get malaria?  Nobody got malaria, but it's a big threat.  You got to take...  If you live through it, it's a great cheap buzz.  Because, like, you hallucinate in here.  You know what the buzz is taking the larium.  Nothing like a high fever to really get those hallucinations going.  Jeff, what do you think of Tony Blair?  If you take the larium, the malaria medication, you get the same LSD ride. 
[02:25:00]  Nice.  Jeff, a quick question.  When they interview these English people on CNN or I support CBS, and that MP afterwards, is that any relation to MF?  Well, historically, yeah, it's derived from the same sort of language.  What does MP stand for?  MP stands for I-5.  Can you please phrase that on the question?  All right, Jeff. 
[02:25:30]  Well, if you're not going to pick this goddamn phone back up...  It's got to be charged.  Hold on.  It's got to be charged now.  Do you have a highway cone you can pick up and talk through?  Just yell.  I got a little now.  From the comfort of your mansion in Los Angeles?  Yeah, I live a party life, let me tell you.  I bet.  Where do you live out there, Jeff?  I live in West Hollywood, the gayest part of the city.  So you're saying that you're anti-gay?  No, I'm not.  I'm just saying that I go to the health club here, and there are very few women to look at. 
[02:26:00]  Thanks, Pat Robertson.  Do you wear a thong when you go to the health club?  That's Jeff Probst's version of surviving every day.  Yeah, there you go.  His butt has to survive another day at the gym.  Jeff, I've been to that same health club, and you do wear a thong to the health club.  You've been there?  You know, I can't help it.  I like my ass, and I want people to see it.  Jeff, what do you think of all the hosts of a lot of these reality shows pretty much doing the Jeff Probst impression? 
[02:26:30]  Right.  I see it.  I see a lot.  They all have their thing that they have to go to, whether it be Bonfire.  Bonfire.  Dismissal Hill.  Dismissal Hill.  And they all try to carry it off like Jeff Probst.  Are you flattered by that?  I'm just glad I was first, so people aren't comparing as many people to me.  But all I worry about is doing Survivor.  And, you know, it's obviously tongue-in-cheek, and it's fun, and it's the best job I've ever had.  With you and some of the girls on the show, it's tongue in other places, apparently. 
[02:27:00]  Apparently the cheeks aren't the only place your tongue's going.  Jeff, any relation to Greg Proofs?  Now, whose line is it anyway?  Is there ever going to be a combo, whose line is going to survive anyway, kind of thing?  I don't think that's going to be bad improv, man.  You have to yell certain things out in the Harlem and Bronx, and if you survive, you win.  Yeah.  Jeff, did you research by watching old episodes of Doctari, which I believe was such a realistic show about Africa? 
[02:27:30]  No.  Kimba the white lion?  Yeah, I was a big, big part of that.  Some danger.  Give us some danger that we'll be seeing on Survivor 3.  You know, it's just the fact that they're out there in the middle, literally living in a hut made of elephant dung and acacia branches with lions everywhere.  Any run-ins with the animals?  Well, I can't say, you know, on the show, but a couple days before we started, one of the locals got literally half his face taken off by a swipe from a lion. 
[02:28:00]  Bummer.  The threat is definitely there.  Bummer?  Bummer.  That might be the wrong word.  Jeff, while you were in Africa, very interesting scientific question.  Were you pooing outside the entire time you were there?  Not the entire time.  The entire time?  Now, would you...  Go ahead, Jim.  No, no, I'd take a dump out in the woods whenever it felt good, just to let the air kind of clear it out. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, look at you.  You guys had to bring your own toilet paper there.  Hey, that's a good question.  I like that one.  You know, they had it there, actually.  This is Jim Norton, by the way.  Yeah, of course it is.  Of course they did.  Hey, this Jeff Probst crap in the woods?  Come on.  Of course they did.  No, we do okay condition-wise.  We're living just fine.  Yeah?  No one injured and had to be airlifted out?  Can't say.  Was anyone jacking it?  Like Cal?  Cal.  I'm sure they were.  They all admit it, but we've got tape of some of them doing it, so... 
[02:29:00]  Hey, can you send some of that over to us, possibly?  Oh, really?  You want to see that?  Anyone having sex with a rhesus monkey?  I love rhesus.  I hear they're tight.  Hey, guess what?  It depends how you eat your rhesus.  Back on the speaker.  He's back on the speaker.  Ah, see, we weren't nice to him, and he went...  What?  Wow.  He's cursing.  He's on speakerphone.  He's trying to watch a ball game.  Jeff Probst cursing.  I think that's wrong.  Run tight.  Thank God he's home, though, and where it's safe. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  God, I'll never...  I should have thought about you asking that question, huh?  I have a feeling he's not giving us his full attention during this interview, Anthony.  That's all right.  Jeff, is there going to be some catchphrase or something?  You have 100% of my attention.  All right, well, then, is it, Jeff, is there going to be something that we're going to  take away from Survivor 3?  Oh, good question, Jim.  That's good.  Is there going to be some catchphrase, like, show me the money, or you make me a better  man, or that lion swiped my face, or something like that, or don't fall in the fire? 
[02:30:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, go ahead, make my day, kind of thing.  Yeah.  Is there anything like that?  Nothing coming to mind, but there is...  You weren't paying attention, you were just there for that fire thing where people get  booted at the end, right?  Yeah, that's all I show up for.  Okay.  I relish the fact of stepping on anyone and pushing hot buttons any chance I can.  Now, you're in charge of the voting.  Do you feel a little bit like a Jimmy Carter who's helping with democracy throughout the  world?  You know, it's funny, I just did a dissertation at Yale on that exact topic. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think what I do is important.  I think it changes the scope of the future for our young children and also immigrants.  We totally stand behind Survivor and Jeff Proach.  Tony Blair and Great Britain stand behind our allies Survivor.  Did you notice that, like, when they said no one has a closer friend, the Canadians got  mad.  They're like, well, I thought we were your best friend.  We're the neighbors to the north, eh?  How do you feel about Canada, Jeff? 
[02:31:00]  I love Canada.  Who would you say is this country's best friend?  Survivor Canada.  I like it.  Boy, think of the action of trying to figure out what a dollar's worth.  Live up one third of the money.  Right.  Getting some of that government-subsidized medical care.  Oh, I love it.  Well, we've got to let Jeff Probst go.  All right, Jeff.  Charge your phone, okay?  Yeah, I know.  Are you going to talk to us during the airing of Survivor 3 at some point?  During the airing of Survivor?  Well, not literally. 
[02:31:30]  It's in Africa, quote-unquote.  Oh, is that it?  You've got to pull that whole gag off?  I'm not here.  It's a live show.  Exactly.  All right, Jeff.  Stay out of the helicopter.  That was a little hokey last year.  Believe me, I'm the first one voting to not do that again.  All right.  Unless you do it like they did in Scarface when Omar got shoved out of the helicopter.  They hang him off of one of the pontoons.  That's right in on Jerry.  All right, Jeff.  We look forward to Survivor 3.  It's Thursday night at 8.  With great anticipation.  Say hi to Jervis. 
[02:32:00]  Right on, guys.  Good talking to you.  Take it easy, Jeff.  Thanks, Jeff.  Jeff Probst.  We were giving a little bit of a hard time there, that interview.  He didn't want to come to New York for some reason.  He was supposed to be live in the studio.  Well, the rumor is he's scared to fly.  Scared to fly.  But he said, no, it wasn't the flying.  It was the fact that he then would be away from home when something horrible was supposed  to happen.  All right.  There you go.  Jim Gaffigan at Caroline's tomorrow night at 7.30.  Thursday at 8.  Saturday at 8.  Tickets will go fast. 
[02:32:30]  He's hilarious.  He's standing behind.  Stick around, Jim, or?  I got to get out of here.  You got to leave now.  I got to get out of here.  I hear it in your voice.  Yeah.  It's a little raspy.  I got a little bit.  Yeah.  You really have to go.  How many beers have you drank there?  A lot?  I don't know.  Look at all the cans in front of Lynch.  That's great.  He's Irish.  What do you expect?  He's like drinking.  Will anyone love me or even notice that I'm killing myself?  I'm killing myself, and Opie and Anthony don't care. 
[02:33:00]  Jim, you're Irish, though.  You don't drink.  They're going to throw you out of the nationality.  I don't drink that much, but it's hard on a date, because you'll be like, yeah, I'll  have a glass of water.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  I'll get you like 10 of them.  No, I've been known to drink.  Yeah?  Only if it makes me cool.  It does.  Yeah.  That and smoking pot.  Listen up, kids.  Whatever makes you cool.  All right.  We've got to let them out of here.  All right, Matt.  Jim Gaffigan at Caroline's this weekend, and on Ellen on, I don't know, CBS Friday, 8 o'clock. 
[02:33:30]  Friday, 8 o'clock, CBS.  Now, let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Afternoon radio.  This is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going?  Opie and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  Ah, it's water again.  O2 Go.  You know, I don't think Gaffigan there appreciated O2 Go. 
[02:34:00]  I think he was being a little sarcastic.  O2 Go.  It's distilled water that has more oxygen in it.  Distilled for health.  And oxygen in it to give you a little perk up, a little pick-me-up.  And it makes it taste great.  Yeah.  O2 Go.  Let's say you got a test coming up.  You want to drink a lot of O2 Go?  Get that oxygen in your system.  Good for your brain, I hear.  Oxygen.  It's like a coffee replacement.  If you're allergic to caffeine or something, the oxygen perks you up. 
[02:34:30]  It's O2 Go.  Get it wherever you buy bottled water, I would guess.  O2 Go.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I hope Vegas liked this one today.  Yeah.  I do think this was a little more of a show we like to do on a daily basis.  Indicative.  Right. 
[02:35:00]  Indicative.  Indicative.  Very good word.  Indicative.  Indicative.  Nice.  I hope they like today.  It doesn't get much better than today.  Yeah, you know.  A little more nudity.  Hey, what happened to a porno chick?  I have no idea.  Ah, twat.  When you can't depend on girls that do porno movies, what's happening to this country?  Country.  This just in.  We'll be live in Vegas tomorrow.  Celebrating our third show. 
[02:35:30]  Our third show for Vegas.  I think we're feeling a buzz and we need to get there and hang with our fans.  Yeah.  Come on, other cities.  Give us the buzz we're feeling in Vegas and we'll come to your city.  Columbus, we're starting to feel a little bit 2003 for you guys.  Vegas tomorrow.  Someone's like, hey man, why are you making fun of Columbus so much today?  We love you guys.  Relax.  Can't take the abuse and you shouldn't listen to this show, right?  Right.  Stephen Lynch, thanks for the D&D song. 
[02:36:00]  You're welcome.  Yeah.  A lot of people bummed they missed the brand new Stephen Lynch song.  We'll play it tomorrow.  And then another 20 times after that.  80,000 more times.  Or they can come here at Rascals in West Orange on the 24th.  Oh, nice.  Or the 25th at Rascals in Orange Township.  You see how smooth he is with his plug?  He's good though.  That was smooth?  Yeah, he kind of works it in nice.  Yeah, we were talking about it.  I save it until the last 10 minutes of the show when nobody's listening.  You stumble all over your plug.  Lynch made it feel like it was part of the show. 
[02:36:30]  It was like, hey, here's a song.  Oh, but if you missed it, you can catch it live here.  You can catch it live, yeah.  I don't have any songs.  Joe, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned Matt Devote is a pen-toting Mary.  I learned anything that causes high school students to kill themselves is a good thing.  Oh, wow.  Anthony gives other men orals who doesn't have to play D&D.  And taxes are okay as long as it doesn't pay for crack babies.  There you go.  You were listening.  Bravo, Joe. 
[02:37:00]  Thank you.  Let's go to Aaron.  Aaron, what's going on, man?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned two things.  I learned, first, that Norton's got spores on his mule.  Spores on his mule.  And also, page six is never on page six.  That's right.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Thank you, bro.  Spores.  Let's move on to Kat.  Kat, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Opie, I learned that as white as you are compared to Jim Gaffigan, you're like Isaac Hayes' Shaft.  Oh, I am so dark compared to Gaffigan.  He was transparent. 
[02:37:30]  He is the whitest American I've ever seen.  And I also learned that video phones in Afghanistan have better sound quality than Jeff Probst on speaker.  You know, you're absolutely right.  Right?  We've seen direct calls from Afghanistan, and Jeff Probst was horrendous on his phone.  I think we asked the important questions with Jeff Probst.  I know.  I think so.  I was one of our better interviews.  Did we get one thing out of him?  Well, I have a feeling his pool boy and gardener are, like, scanning the skies for incoming for him while he's got his feet up watching the game.  He's got Annie Ackerman things on his lawn. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, right.  Defend my home.  I'm Jeff Probst.  And I also learned, you've got to get a song.  I really do need a song.  Yeah, we'll get a song in D.C.  Yeah, we'll get a song in D.C.  All right, I've got a show on Sunday at the Kennedy Center at 6 p.m.  Now you're pushing.  Wow.  Gentlemen, have a great night.  All right.  Bye.  I'll be on the 6th floor of the Book Depository in Dilley Plaza.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I learned three things today.  I learned Yosemite Sam is a terrorist.  Yeah.  I learned Jim Gaffigan has some serious anthrax. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Or diarrhea.  And finally, I learned that it's safe for Philly girls to go to the road show.  But I have some advice for them.  All right.  Make sure you don't go on stage to become a human Sunday and then strip.  And then tease the crowd when you're stripping.  Not a good idea.  Yeah.  Like the Vanderbilt.  Okay, terrific.  Here's an idea.  Look, he punched out his man now.  You're going in, Steve.  Yo.  Hey.  I learned Norton's big stock tip is to buy Blue Star Airlines. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  Blue Star Airlines.  And he should be buying Teldar paper.  Oh, nice.  Nobody caught that.  My father doesn't work for Teldar paper.  He's a blue star.  Blue horseshoe loves Teldar paper.  Good job, bro.  Good call.  All right.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned Simon tried balloon nothing and got balloon nothing.  Hey, you were listening.  There you go.  Very nice.  Simon.  Let's go to Philly and see what Jay learned. 
[02:39:30]  Hey, Jay.  Hey, I learned two things.  One, Afghanistan now looks like Asbury Park.  Yeah.  And kayaking and balloon nothing are two things to do with your girlfriend.  That's a good call.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I learned that Afghanis have diarrhea cold skin.  That was out of nowhere today.  Thank you.  Thank you, bro.  Thank you.  All right.  Nice.  If you want to answer feedback, Biscuit Head, I learned the stairwell is the new hot spot 
[02:40:00]  in Manhattan.  New word for today, impropitude.  Finger bang.  I learned Barney Miller hash brownie references still funny after 25 years.  Jerry writes, I learned Jim Gaffigan turned Ellen gay.  And curly toed shoes find the G spot.  Al Mack, today I learned that it takes more than a clear, salty, drug-induced booger on  Norton's lip to make him lose his rod.  Al Mack, best one of the day right there. 
[02:40:30]  No one's going to beat you.  Wren writes, today I learned that the stealth bomber is quiet like a virgin farting and  that diarrhea jokes are always funny.  And last word from Tony Blair.  Yeah, baby.  Do I make you horny?  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Joe.  Yeah, I learned that the special lemon flavoring for the stuff makes it harder for Norton to  get it off his back. 
[02:41:00]  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Thank you, bro.  Later.  Suck it with a Jolly Rancher in your mouth, bitch.  That's how you improve the taste.  Who cares?  Enough said.  Screw the drugs.  Just get a watermelon Jolly Rancher.  I think we're done.  But if it tastes so bad, if the taste is bad, what you do is just pull it out and you spray  it in her hair.  And you say, next time, you'll be grateful for the taste, won't you? 
[02:41:30]  Miss, I'll be picking this out for three days.  Oh, man.  Hey, we got five pairs of tickets to see Jane's Addiction at the Continental Arena on Tuesday,  October 16th.  A few tickets still available through all Ticketmaster outlets, but we'll give some Jane's Addiction  tickets away right now to some of the phone callers on hold to play What Do We Learn,  okay?  Right.  And, Stephen Lynch, plug that gig one more time there.  Kennedy Center this Sunday, Washington, D.C., 6 p.m., free show. 
[02:42:00]  No, and the other one.  Oh.  Rascals on the 24th in West Orange.  Rascals in Ocean Township on the 25th.  Or Gotham on the 18th.  Look at Norton's in there like, you son of a bitch.  No, I'm just thinking that will get confusing because they, if you give them a bunch of  dates out sometimes, then people call me.  You learned that from me, you did.  I know.  You're the worst.  I'm supposed to be a governor on the 17th, but I'm going to try to change that.  Yeah, so you can go to Philly for the mode show.  Nice.  All right.  Let's see if it happens.  Hey, guys, thanks.  I don't know if this sounded like anything today, but we sure had fun. 
[02:42:30]  I had some fun.  And we'll do it again tomorrow at 3.  Peace.  Well, there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's O&M, the Opie and Anthony  show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power. </pre>
