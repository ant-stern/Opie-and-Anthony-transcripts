<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment heavily criticizing the upcoming 10th anniversary of 9/11 media coverage, using highly offensive language to express their anger at what they perceived as superficial commemorations and a lack of focus on first responders and the rebuilding efforts at Ground Zero.  They criticized Mayor Bloomberg, the media's handling of terrorism, and debated the official narrative surrounding the attacks.  A caller, Dave, a teacher, shared his anxieties about teaching 9/11 to his students, prompting the hosts to critique a children’s educational cartoon on the subject. The conversation touched on Ron Paul, Obama, and a local double suicide.  A construction worker, Ron from Jersey, called in to describe the difficulties of working on the World Trade Center reconstruction.  The segment concluded with the hosts playing clips from ABC News’ 9/11 coverage to further their points.

The show then transitioned into a discussion of the 9/11 aftermath and rebuilding efforts, quickly veering into a humorous tangent about a “Brain Pop” educational video and sarcastic commentary on the anniversary commemorations, suggesting a focus on lawyers who profited from the event.  In-studio guests Emmett Smith (former NFL player) and Sammy Sweetheart (*Jersey Shore*) were introduced.  The hosts engaged in a vulgar and transphobic discussion of Chaz Bono's transition.  A lengthy debate ensued about the moon landing photos and a frustrating search for a video of a black hole consuming a star, resulting in Sam, a staff member, being "Rick Rolled."  The conversation shifted to graphic descriptions of bodies on Mount Everest, the challenges of retrieval, and their use as landmarks. A caller provided information about the "death zone" and the physiological effects of high altitude.  Attempts to find the black hole video continued throughout this segment.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on determining the average time spent on the summit of Mount Everest.  The hosts, along with producer Sam, repeatedly searched online and called listeners, encountering many wrong answers and fruitless interactions with Ask Jeeves. They discussed Sherpa Babu Sharipa, initially misreporting his summit time.  Listener calls, discussions of Beck Weathers (whose name became a running joke), Everest’s mortality rate, and the summit's size filled the segment.  A caller, Tom from White Plains, estimated 17 minutes, while later information suggested around an hour.  The hosts also discussed a man who meditated for 27 hours on Everest.  The search for information on Babu Sherpa led to finding his Twitter account and the discovery of his son's death, resulting in discussion of his tweets and his rapidly increasing follower count.  The conversation then shifted to upcoming guests Sammy Sweetheart and Emmitt Smith, with jokes about Sammy's appearance and Emmitt's potential for a hallway football run.  A reading from Emmitt Smith's book, "Game On," was included, followed by further discussion of Babu Sherpa's death, believed to have occurred while taking photographs.  The segment concluded with offensive racial slurs and vulgar language.

The show then discussed their minor placement in a SiriusXM brochure, with Gary, a show staffer, expressing visible upset.  Concerns about playing a 9/11 audio clip due to legal issues led to considering playing their September 10th, 2001, show instead.  Sammy Sweetheart arrived late for her interview, leading to frustration and offensive comments about Snooki.  Sammy discussed her relationship with Ronnie, her new perfume ("Dangerous for Women"), and her Italian experience.  Her interview was cut short by the arrival of Emmett Smith.

Emmitt Smith’s interview focused on his post-football career in business and real estate, his book "Game On," faith, and football.  He discussed transitioning from football to business, conversations with other athletes (Staubach, Jordan), his perspective on athletes thanking God after games, his top five most talented current NFL players, and his preference for college football.  The segment concluded with promotion of his book.

After the interview, the hosts discussed their impressions of Smith and Sammy Sweetheart, recounting a humorous incident involving accidentally pushing Sammy aside.  The conversation then shifted to action figures/dolls and Sam Roberts’ collection.  Numerous references to the Dallas Cowboys followed.  A phone call with Bobo, a recurring caller, regarding a cancelled contest led to tension.  The show concluded with discussion of upcoming guests and segments, including a mention of Triple H's brief studio visit.

Finally, the excerpt featuring Triple H and Sammy Giancola began with discussion of Management Gary’s appearance.  Triple H’s visit included banter about past interactions, his new movie *Inside Out*, and potential WWE Network involvement.  They discussed former WWE employees initially criticizing, then later praising the company, and Triple H’s upcoming wrestling match. Sammy Giancola discussed her post-*Jersey Shore* life, her perfume line, relationship with Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, and her perspective on the show and its cast, including sexually suggestive comments about Ronnie's drinking and the Situation's intoxicated behavior.  The conversation touched on the show's success and popularity. Ron Bennington appeared briefly, providing humorous commentary.  The hosts discussed the absence of the Kardashians as a scheduled guest and wrapped up the segment, mentioning plans to air a future episode featuring Bill Burr.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, it's Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta catch it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite.  Yeah, oh fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, bro.  Yeah, a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:00:30]  This show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  The Opie and Anthony were saying it.  Well then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumb ass.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:01:00]  La la la la la.  Morning.  Four days to go, Ant.  Is that how we work?  Four days to go.  Actually, it's three.  Three? What day is today?  Wednesday, remember?  We started on a Tuesday.  Oh no, I mean four days to go before the big 10-year anniversary of 9-11.  I just want to remind people, because I don't think they know that yet.  We were kind of going off on this before the show today. 
[00:01:30]  And wait until I'm done before you hang me.  I'm sick of this shit.  I'm sick of it.  I swear I was waiting for a 9-11 10-year anniversary car dealership sale.  Now, everybody, all the stations want their exclusive coverage to be watched.  Join us on CBS this Sunday as the entire day is dedicated to remembering 9-11.  Plink, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank.  Sombor piano, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, plank, mayor shit fuck of New York 
[00:02:00]  already showed the flag, the commemorative flag opiates.  It's two towers in white.  Blue background.  Nice.  Pentagon shape around that.  within the stars of the number of people  that were killed in Pennsylvania.  And on the bottom it says, you know,  always remember, never forget  whatever the fuck he's completely done.  See, whatever he's completely done, 
[00:02:30]  we remember.  Do ya?  While you a sucking fucking Islamic cock  down town to get that fucking mosque built,  remember my dick.  You don't remember shit.  The people that remember the most  don't want to fucking watch this shit on Sunday.  I do not want to see entire programs  dedicated to memories that people had,  fucking watching the plane smash again,  fucking listening to this jackass mayor we got 
[00:03:00]  pontificating.  You don't think he remembers  when there's a Times Square bombing?  Oh, he remembered.  He's remembering, get Giuliani out  so I can get the fuck into office.  That's all he was remembering.  Oh, Giuliani wanted another term  to keep things going.  You know, in a forward-moving direction.  But he said, no, come on, we gotta move on.  Until his time was up.  And then he wanted another term  and just made himself Pope of New York.  And no one questioned that.  No.  No.  So fuck him.  Fuck every network 
[00:03:30]  that's putting on a dog and pony fuck show  that has to do with 9-11.  If you truly remember,  and do not forget 9-11,  you don't need these shows.  I don't want to watch them.  I remember every fucking detail.  Thank you very much.  Don't shove it down my throat.  What are they supposed to do, though?  And it's all the people that forgot,  by the way,  that are doing these shows.  What are they supposed to do  for the 10-year anniversary?  You go, wow, holy shit,  that was 10 years.  Amazing.  Yeah.  It went fast.  And then I want to look downtown  and say,  wow, they've really come far in rebuilding. 
[00:04:00]  That's it.  I don't need memories of,  I don't need fucking,  first of all,  they treat the first responders  like dog shit.  Oh, elevated cancer rates?  Yeah, it's proven.  Well, not with us.  So why don't you go die of cancer  somewhere in a corner  and we'll just,  we'll talk about how great you were  10 years later.  So the symbolism is there.  The substance,  bad, not so much.  Well, he blamed,  after there was another Islamic bombing,  he blamed the Tea Party people 
[00:04:30]  or people against health care reform.  He sucks.  He doesn't remember.  If you behave like you remember,  people say you're Islamophobic.  Right.  Yes.  Remember how everybody was?  Yeah, I'll remember.  Remember how everybody was  right after it happened  and we started getting news  that it was all Islamic fucking jihadists  that flew these planes into the building  and we all had a deep fucking suspicion,  if not a hatred,  for these extremists  and I'm not talking about fucking any Muslim 
[00:05:00]  that's going to their mosque  and praying  and working for a living,  whatever.  Whatever.  But you know what?  It was Islamic extremists  and you can't even say that anymore  without saying,  well, you're condemning a whole people.  Yeah!  Extremists!  You dumb fuck!  That's why they're called extremists!  I didn't say Muslims.  I didn't say all of Islam.  Islamic extremists are dangerous  and they will try to kill you.  I think you've adjusted  because didn't you hate all Muslims 
[00:05:30]  for a while there?  Be honest.  You know what?  I was suspicious of every single one.  Okay.  I thought everybody in a mosque  was probably whispering  and planning something,  which I'm still not absolutely sure  ain't happening,  but I'll give them the benefit  of the doubt at this point.  I think you've grown  in the last year or two.  Yeah.  Now you're saying extremists.  Yeah, I'm maturing.  No, I think you make  a really good point.  The people that remember  don't need the shit.  Don't need this bullshit.  They don't need the bullshit.  I'm actually offended by it.  They don't need the bullshit  programming packages  with the logos  and the somber music 
[00:06:00]  and the invitation list  that people are allowed to go.  Some people aren't.  What is this?  A sweet 16?  You fucking owe.  You can't come to my party.  Who's not allowed to go?  Oh, maybe first responders.  Oh.  Yeah, you know.  What do you want?  Because too many politicians  have to get their fucking face seen  on camera  in front of, you know,  the resurrection.  How are they making money  off this thing?  You know they're making money  off it somehow,  but you can't make it  very obvious.  Of course.  First of all,  the city makes money. 
[00:06:30]  The city makes money  just because there's going to be  a lot of people in town  to be here for that.  Is there a party somewhere?  It's income.  I'm sure.  They won't call them parties.  They'll call them remembrances  and commemorations  and things like that,  but they're parties.  Oh, well.  Well, we're four days out.  Sunday.  I'm so glad, by the way,  because you've been reading  the same shit I have  on Twitter and stuff.  I'm so glad we're not working  on that day.  I wouldn't be happier.  I don't want any part of this. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  I could not be happier.  I am popping in  a Twilight Zone marathon  and just watching that.  I fucking had it.  I looked at the calendar.  I'm like,  it's a Sunday.  Thank God.  Really?  We don't want to play  into that bullshit.  No.  It was a horrendous event  that affected all of us.  I haven't forgotten.  None of us in this room  have forgotten,  and I don't need to see this shit.  Wouldn't they have rebuilt  the buildings if they remembered?  Wouldn't that be done already?  Yeah.  Where's all the patriotism  when it comes to  the fucking bureaucracy  of the Port Authority  and of all the insurance companies? 
[00:07:30]  Where's all that patriotism  when there is none?  You want to be patriotic?  Show the insurance companies  who are denying benefits.  Show the names of the people  doing that  instead of the people  that are dead.  It is good to see  the building finally popping  out of the skyline  when you're coming in  from Long Island  or coming in from Jersey.  But let me tell you something.  But it's an embarrassment  that 10-year anniversary  and the damn thing  is not done.  That should have been there  five years ago.  It should have been  at this level.  Easily.  At least.  Easily.  It's embarrassing  that they still got  fucking cranes  on that damn thing 
[00:08:00]  10 years later.  Deadhead later.  Sam, could you do me a favor?  Yeah.  Please give me the information.  How long did it take  to build the Twin Towers?  How long did it take  from beginning to end  to build the Twin Towers?  You do know the answer.  I just saw a documentary.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  On the Twin Towers?  Four months.  Wow.  Two months per tower?  Two months per tower, yes.  That's fast.  Technically,  but they did the four towers.  Someone's saying 27 minutes.  I'm in the two towers  in four months.  Wow.  Was it three years?  No, four months.  New York City. 
[00:08:30]  Well, they actually  built them somewhere else  and brought them up  and just put them there.  That's right.  You're off the man.  Through the tunnel.  That's right.  It might have been  three years somewhere else,  but they put them together  in four months down there.  Let's see.  I don't care about planning  and stuff.  I mean, when they laid  that first brick down.  Do they lay an actual  brick down it?  Yeah, they did.  They do.  And then do they  take that brick away?  The cornerstone.  And some groups  are suing because  the cross,  which was left over  from the building.  Yeah.  Like some of you atheists,  I get you.  I understand you  have the right to believe,  but some of you  are just assholes. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, shitheads.  You're just assholes.  Shitheads.  Who cares if there's  a cross down there?  Someone's actually  riding no way  four months.  No, it was four months.  You people  are fucking retarded.  What are we looking at?  Groundbreaking.  What?  Groundbreaking.  Groundbreaking.  Groundbreaking for  the construction.  August 5th, 66.  66.  Yep.  The topping out  of ceremony.  71. 
[00:09:30]  71.  The ribbon cutting  ceremony was April.  I don't care.  When was it?  It was built.  Topped it off.  Built in 71.  When the guy just  went like this  with his hands  and went,  we're done.  Five years.  66 to 71.  Five years.  Two fucking buildings.  And equipment was  not the same then  as it is now.  Oh, I thought  it was much better  back then.  Oh, yeah.  I think that  those guys  sitting on an I-beam  with their lunch pails  was taken  when they were  building that.  See?  Ah, yeah.  And the bureaucratic 
[00:10:00]  crap, the political  correctness that started  shoving its face in,  the one where they  wanted to put up  memorials,  and then they're like,  well, should the  firemen be all  together in one spot?  And then the people  that were in the  buildings, and then  they're arguing  with other people,  and nothing got  done.  Yeah.  Forget.  Bye-bye.  Forget.  Remember they put  the black fireman  where the white  fireman was to  commemorate the picture?  To make it  politically correct.  They changed  revision history  all over the place.  I'm disgusted.  That's why.  I will only throw  things at my TV  if I watch this. 
[00:10:30]  Because it's all  fake shit.  Ten years later,  they've made a  story out of it  that wasn't actually  what happened.  So, go fuck  yourself and get  dumb coverage.  Are you sick of  this country just  arguing all the  time now?  Yes.  It's just a  constant argument.  It's constant.  We have like,  what, four  kinda news channels  on?  They're kinda  news, I call  them.  Kinda news.  And they're all  just arguing.  That's all they  do.  They argue with  each other.  Nothing is getting  done in this  country.  I don't give a  fuck what side  you're on.  I don't care.  Show video of people 
[00:11:00]  arguing.  No one is working  together.  We just argue shit.  It's just all  arguing.  Hey, someone's  telling me that the  Empire State Building  built in 13 months.  Is that possible?  It could fucking  be.  I don't know.  In the 30s?  I think the Empire  State Building goes  back to the 30s,  right?  Isn't that brick,  though?  Isn't that different  to construct brick?  13 months in  1930s?  We didn't even have  TV yet.  That's crazy.  Let's see.  Built in 1929 to  1931.  Alright, that's  possible.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:11:30]  Wait, so how  many...  Even just saying  two years is crazy  back then.  What month in  1929?  Ah.  April Fool's Day  because the big  joke was, hey, we  found the steeple.  Where is it?  I'm just fooling.  Excavation began  January 21st, 1930.  And, let's see,  ribbon cutting May  1st, 1931.  That's insanity.  Wow.  Wow.  And their equipment  really sucked.  13, 14 months. 
[00:12:00]  Those were the  lunch pail guys.  Lunch pail guys.  Lunch pail guys  know how to build.  We should bring  them back.  And that plane  got hit with a  fucking bomber  back during  World War II.  The building  did, yeah.  Yeah.  Who the fuck  would do that  job?  Look at this  picture.  No safety line.  The guy's just  sitting out on the  corner of an I-beam  with a wrench.  Whistling a happy  tune, by the way.  Yeah.  No wonder guys  died when they  were 37 years old  back then.  Imagine the stress  in his fucking  heart.  And then they  would just, they  would take red  hot rivets and  fling them at 
[00:12:30]  the workers who  had these almost  like catcher's  gloves made out  of leather.  And they would  catch the red  hot rivets and  then another guy  would take them  in these big  clamps and shove  them into the  holes and then  this big pneumatic  thing would  bap.  Or they would  just hammer  them for the  rivets and put  together these  beams that way.  You think someone  sat around and  said let's try to  make this more  dangerous.  The lunch pail  guys have no  harnesses.  How do we make  it even more  dangerous?  Let's throw  red hot rivets  at them.  Yeah.  You gotta think 
[00:13:00]  you lost a couple  guys because they  got to slightly  scared and throw  them off balance.  Just get back to  grab the rivet and  tipped over.  How awful the fall  catching a red hot  rivet.  Do you know how  many guys probably  shaved 10 years  off their lives  when a wrench like  that would slip and  you'd go.  Like you know when  you're pulling on a  wrench and it slips  and you lose your  balance.  But you're on an  I-beam.  How many deaths for  the Empire State  Building?  construction.  And the Chrysler  Building's in the  back too.  Yeah.  How old is that?  That's gotta be.  I don't know.  That was I used 
[00:13:30]  to know that shit.  Turn of the century  obviously.  I would say  1917.  Empire State Building  construction deaths.  I'd like to know  how many people died  doing that fucking  thing.  The Empire.  13 months of  building.  Five.  Five guys.  That's it.  That's it.  Five guys.  13 months.  Tallest building in  the world at the  time.  And amazing.  I would have  thought more.  So would I.  Of course.  Maybe they didn't  consider the you-know-whats  guys.  Yeah, right. 
[00:14:00]  That's five white  workers.  Yeah, yeah.  They only acknowledged  the black workers.  They only acknowledged  the white workers.  That's true.  Oh, oh, oh, the blacks  too.  Yes, 583.  We lost.  Plummeted to their  deaths.  We lost 2,500 Indians,  but we don't.  We didn't count them  as people in 1930.  And a few hiney-hatted  Chinese.  Right.  But more than 30  people have committed  suicide by jumping  off the top of the  Empire State Valley.  Killed themselves after  it was built, then died.  Speaking of suicide  from jumping, our 
[00:14:30]  neighborhood, Jimmy,  second guy in, or  second person, because  I think the other one  was a woman, second  person in less than a  year fucking doing a  header.  Two buildings down.  Oh, wow.  Right in my  neighborhood.  Away from, on, facing  the water, to your  left?  Yep.  Oh, wow.  Twice off that  building?  Yeah, same building.  A landlord, the  door guys must be  cunts.  Two headers.  Wow.  Yeah.  How many floors?  I don't know the  second one.  I was on vacation, but  they're talking in the  hood.  Enough, I guess. 
[00:15:00]  Enough.  Oh, yeah.  What do they say?  You only need fucking  two stories, really?  You know something?  You fall right.  You fall properly.  You could trip over a  fucking border.  All right, now we got  guys really mad because  they're working down  there at the World  Trade Center.  And they want to, I  guess Bloomberg wants  to call the World  Trade Center now and  not Ground Zero.  All right.  But that's forgetting,  isn't it?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't mind  that.  I don't like the name  Freedom Tower.  No, Freedom Tower.  Well, that was a joke.  Is that still called  that or no?  I don't know.  I haven't heard it, so  it didn't really take  off.  Yeah, it's an 
[00:15:30]  embarrassment to call it  the Freedom Tower.  That's ridiculous.  Where's Freedom?  I still call French  Fries Freedom Fries.  Me too.  So we're still mad at  the French, you know?  I just eat them.  Oh, that's true.  They are tasty.  They are delish.  What is Ron from  Jersey?  What's his major  maladjustment?  Hey there, Ron.  How you doing?  Hey, Ronnie.  Hey, Ron.  Hey, how you doing,  guys?  That's you, yes.  Hey, Ron.  You guys talk about  how long it's taken  to rebuild this place.  Yeah.  It's 16 acres.  It's just not the two  buildings that were there. 
[00:16:00]  You're talking seven  stories in the ground.  It had to remove all  the buildings around.  That's all, that's  everything they did  originally.  I worked down there.  No, we hammered 30 to  40 feet of ledge rock  the size of 10 football  fields out of there to  rebuild it.  The tower, they call it  Tower One, which is the  Freedom Tower.  They all call that, though.  Ron, I don't, I...  There's more concrete.  There's more concrete in  the first seven stories  to that building and the  whole Empire State  building.  All right.  Because it's him.  Ron, I, I, I, 
[00:16:30]  unfortunately, we have  a lot of people that  only listen to us with,  I don't know, a half,  quarter, quarter,  maybe.  Quarter ear.  I don't think we're  attacking the actual  workers.  You know that, right?  Bureaucracy.  We're, we're, we're  attacking the red tape.  I love you guys,  anyway.  All right, but we're  not attacking you guys.  We're really not.  And I bet you if we  sat you guys down and  had a few beers, you  would tell us a lot of  shit that, uh, is  going on down there that  you don't understand.  And the concrete is  strictly, and the  concrete, by the way,  uh, is strictly for  protection.  Yeah.  It's a core. 
[00:17:00]  We're not saying the  workers haven't done  their jobs.  No, not at all.  We're not saying that.  We're saying the  bureaucracy that, we,  you guys probably could  have had this done five  years ago.  Yeah, you guys should  have been down there  already.  I agree with you.  Uh, but when I work  there, we would, it's  seven days a week.  I take a day off.  They're like, what do  you mean you want a day  off?  I'm like, I got a family.  Nah, nah, there are no  days off.  This is a seven day a week  job.  So it was brutal down.  It was like a prison  sentence down there.  God, it sounds like  our jobs, man.  It's like employment.  We're the same  fucking people. 
[00:17:30]  Trust me, I wish.  But, uh, what I'm  saying is there, uh,  there's a show  rebuilding Ground Zero  too, which shows a lot.  It's not about the  sorrow and the, and the  deaths and everything.  It has a lot to do  with what went into  this, this project.  I do like watching  those shows.  Do you know what I  saw, which was good?  It was not about the  rebuilding.  You liked the show.  It's not about, sorry,  but it's not the  rebuilding.  It's, it's Roland gave us  a DVD of the guy who  had done the pictures  that Ted did that dumb  bit on taking all those  photos.  Oh, you finally saw the  movie?  Where they interview  people, but they  interview them from 2001. 
[00:18:00]  There's like four people  they follow and they  interview them once a  year up until 2010.  So you can see their  grief process.  It's very, very  interesting.  That sounds interesting.  At least that has like  a thing to it.  It's not just, you see the  woman.  Oh, she moved on, moved  on.  She's got two kids.  Thank you, buddy.  And is now married to  somebody else.  I'm like, that's exactly  what happens eventually.  She grieved for five  years up, man.  She was a rough one to  watch.  She was like, oh, if  you die first, you're,  you're fucking forgotten.  That's the reality of the  whole fucking thing. 
[00:18:30]  God damn shame.  And what was it?  Um, yeah.  I don't know.  Did you like that movie,  Jimmy?  Very much.  It was a little slow  though, right?  Yeah, but I mean, it  was interesting to see.  I didn't realize it was  once a year interviews  for 10 years, but they,  they, uh, they show the  grief process was the  most interesting, but  like five or six or  seven years later, these  people were still  suffering.  What about the kid?  Uh, yeah.  The kid came from this,  it seemed like a pretty  damn solid family.  His, uh, mom died 9-11  and the father was 
[00:19:00]  remarried within what?  Four months or  something.  No, it might have  been two years or a  year.  It was, it was too  cute.  It was a great  relationship.  Well, he said it  was, it was way too  quick.  Oh, really?  I forgot the times.  Uh, I guess I forgot  the, yeah, how long it  was, but, uh, and then  the new, uh, wife didn't  like the kid.  So then the father blew  off the kid.  Whoa.  Like, yeah, there's  great, like, little life  for himself.  And because of what  happened on 9-11, he  was kind of shunned  by the new wife.  And then that meant,  meant the father couldn't  really hang with him  anymore.  I hated the father for 
[00:19:30]  that, but then I  thought like, oh yeah,  he lost, and the kid  points out, well, he  lost his wife and his,  you know, it's like,  people just react weird  and grief.  It's a pretty good  movie.  I mean, I would, I  would watch the History  Channel if they're doing  something.  Yeah, something like  that.  But this, this, this  packaging crap that  every network's doing.  Right.  With the drama, with  the music, with the  graphics.  It's going to be, here  it, here it is too.  Let me, let me explain  what you're going to  see.  Yeah.  You're going to see  the news people, all  of them, uh, the, the  stars will be out too. 
[00:20:00]  It's Sunday, but believe  me, the stars of all the  networks are going to be  out that day.  They're not going to,  they're not going to  take the day off.  They're going to be  there in, uh, suits like  they're at a fucking  funeral and the women  will be in their nicest,  uh, dresses and stuff.  They're going to sit  there and instead of  that news thing, it's  going to be to, to, to,  to, to the same type of  yes.  Yes.  CBS remembers.  We remember nine 
[00:20:30]  11, 10 years later.  And now back to two  shitheads who don't give  a flying fuck yet are  dressed in a, like  they're at a wedding.  And now, uh, they sit  down and paw through  some bullshit that an  intern put together and  they'll make it sound like,  uh, it means something to  everybody out there.  And, uh, by the way,  while they break for  commercial, the makeup  people are going to run  over because it's more  important how they look  than actually what's on 
[00:21:00]  the screen and what  they're even fucking  talking about, which is  all on teleprompter  perish the thought.  They take one second to  actually emote and tell  people what they really  felt that day.  Lest it not be on the  teleprompter.  Oh, and now back to our  shitheads.  It's so, that's what it's  going to be.  It's so fucking true.  It's so true.  Uh, they don't report  like they were, you  know, when they report  politically correct, or  when, when, uh, major  Hassan, I think his name  was, goes on a shooting 
[00:21:30]  spree, that guy goes on  a shooting spree and  Obama doesn't want to  say that it's an, it's  an, it's an act of  terrorism.  It's like, or that, or  that, um, is radical  Islam is the motive.  Yeah.  It's not all Muslims, but  that guy did it and was  yelling Allah Akbar and  shooting people.  All they say is don't  jump to conclusions.  Don't assume that it is  what you know it is.  They have not acted  like they remember.  So don't force it down  our throats.  Yeah.  When we're complaining  about it all the time  and we act like people  think that we're, uh,  we're racist.  Yeah.  We're complaining  about it.  I'm remembering.  You're not.  You're the one not  remembering. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Don't have your once  a year ceremony and  tell the rest of us  that we need to  remember.  Go fuck yourself.  Uh, Dave in New York  City, Anthony.  Uh, very upset.  Dave.  What's up, fellas?  Happy Friday, Jim.  Thank you, Dave.  Uh, okay.  I worked for three  years at 120 Broadway  directly across from  the Trade Center.  And, uh, I became a  teacher, uh, in  September of 2001.  I got ready to show.  And I think that, uh,  you know, they should  show what's going on.  This is my 10th year  teaching and a lot of 
[00:22:30]  my kids, I talk about  it in class and a lot  of the kids have no  idea.  They obviously weren't,  uh, they weren't  around them.  Oh, boy.  Dave.  Oh, boy.  Like we just said,  25%.  Eighth year?  What are you thinking?  This guy.  A what?  Eighth year or a  16th of an year?  How much did he  listen?  It's less than 25%.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're not saying, uh,  you shouldn't do  anything every year,  but how they do it  is driving us  fucking nuts.  That's what we're  saying.  I even said, if the  History Channel did  something on this, I  would watch that because 
[00:23:00]  I know that it's not  going to be all glitz  and glam.  Right.  Would you rather your  students, uh, watch  some kind of, uh, weekly  put together news  program that the next  day on Monday they're  just going to throw  out or would you like  them to see something  that was put together  over the course of  years on the Discovery  Channel or, uh,  something about, about  modern marvels,  anything, uh, about  how this happened?  I think it should be  both.  I think they have the  opportunity to see the  actual broadcast from  that day as well as  Well, if you want to 
[00:23:30]  see that.  Well, that's everywhere.  If you want to see  that, that's fine.  Again, that's fact.  That's what happened.  That's what we reacted  to that day.  Not fucking some, some  news bimbo and some  fucking guy that's  already been through  two facelifts and  trying to keep himself  on the air, just, just  squawking, squawking  about remembering.  Look, watch the CNN.  Look at the broad in  the middle.  We're getting our, our  news from her.  From that fucking,  look at her hair. 
[00:24:00]  She looks like she's  going to a, I don't  know, a wedding.  Like you said.  Believe me, they used  to just shove some  powder in these people's  faces and let them go  on the air.  Of course.  There's stylists all  over the place.  Yeah.  Do you know there's a  site now which  actually was pretty cool?  Thanks for your phone  call.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  You know where you  can direct people  to?  And I don't know  the exact site.  It was on AOL's  homepage where they've  archived September.  Meat spin?  No, no.  That's my homepage.  Eat a bullet.  It's when the 11, I  think it's September  11th through 17, all  these hours of news 
[00:24:30]  coverage just as they  were.  And you could do it  like from Chinese,  American, from Moscow  news, and you could just  see how they covered it  in the moments.  And you know what?  See, that's great.  If you want to do  that, fine.  Back then, 10 years  ago, you got all these  news people, these news  readers, very raw.  On camera.  Yeah, because they  didn't know what the  fuck was going on.  They had to throw out  their fucking news and  everything and go with  it.  They had no choice.  That was very interesting  and worth watching.  But now that they're  sitting there and  overthinking everything,  this Sunday is going to  be, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  And the politicians, like  they do on the fucking  St. Paddy's Day, it's  great, I know.  And then they got to  have their face seen.  Yeah.  Like, this is now a place  to be seen.  Right.  Hey, the Bravest.  It's a disgrace.  The Bravest on Twitter  writes, no firemen at  ground zero this 9-11.  Mayor Bloomberg says  there's just not enough  room to include them.  Not enough room for the  firemen.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, first responders,  politicians, and then I  don't know, whoever else he  decided was worthy of going 
[00:25:30]  down there and speaking.  I've seen what this city  Some family members.  But I've seen what this  city could do when they  want to set something up.  They could set up a mini  stadium down there.  Yeah.  And do it properly.  There you go.  Seriously, get the  fucking bleachers and  whatnot, and they should  have set this up properly.  Somebody emailed me and  said that the reason  And make enough room.  That there literally are  just too many first  responders.  Like, numerically, there's  too many to fit down  there.  How many, does anybody  know, because we were  screaming about this  recently, and it might have 
[00:26:00]  been in the week open,  you were gone, or maybe  it was before, we were  complaining, where are the  first responders, and  somebody emailed me and  said, like, there's just  too many of them.  Like, there's thousands of  them that went in the  first couple days.  Right.  And, like, by including a  lot, you're going to  exclude a lot.  I don't know.  Maybe somebody knows that  more than me.  They could have set that  place up to make sure  everyone is there easily.  Or have a first responder  lottery or something.  Did you get most of them  down there?  Right.  I don't know what  you're talking about.  Or have something maybe  slightly off-site with big 
[00:26:30]  video screens, whatever  it takes.  Whatever it takes.  Is Sam looking at a  broadcast that was that  day?  Yeah.  And this is what?  What show is this?  This is on ABC, it must  be Good Morning America.  Good Morning America.  And they're just showing,  like, some bad movie  review, and one of the  segments.  Your pets?  Yeah, Long Life for  Pets.  Long Life for Pets.  And now they're showing  an interview with Fergie.  You know, the older  Fergie.  Not the new Fergie.  Not the new Fergie.  Fergie.  That Fergie. 
[00:27:00]  But it's weird because  now Sam's going, like,  click, click, at, like,  five-minute increments.  Okay, that was it.  Like, and then it just  clicked in out of nowhere.  Long Life for Pets.  Long Life for Pets.  Long Life for Pets.  Three years, two-and-a-half  million dead.  We thought you should know.  Oh, thank you.  Well, thank you.  Heart of Darkness.  This week, well, I guess  that show got fucking  shit-canned, huh?  It continues tonight, it  says.  We want to tell you  what we know as we know  it.  Well, we just got a report  and that there's been  some sort of explosion  at the World Trade Center 
[00:27:30]  in New York City.  It's terrible.  One report said,  and we can't confirm  any of this,  that a plane may have  hit one of the two  towers of the World Trade  Center.  But again, you're seeing  the live pictures here.  We have a plane in print.  Maybe you could speculate.  Even these graphics  look old.  Like old baseball  from the 70s graphics?  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to find out  and, of course,  make sure that everybody  knows on the air.  These are, of course,  the two twin Trade Center  buildings that are down  at the foot of Manhattan  that they really are.  We know that, stupid. 
[00:28:00]  Who are those?  It was there that there  was the explosion  a couple of years ago  brought about by terrorists.  It was eight years  before that, 93 dummies.  We don't know anything  about more than a couple.  We don't know about  anything that has happened  here other than the fact  that there's obviously  been a major incident there  and we're going to go  to a special report  now from ABC News.  Oh, oh.  Back to ABC News.  See?  They don't have  their cell phone.  Oh, yeah,  they've got to put  that big graphic up.  The graphic special report.  Even in a live event.  This is an ABC News. 
[00:28:30]  They're just cunts.  We get it.  You get credit.  Now, by the entire  ABC network.  Back to them?  Back to them anyway.  But we're joined  by the entire network  just to show you  some pictures  at the foot of New York City.  This is at the World Trade Center.  I know.  Obviously.  So nasty.  But it's really interesting  to see how the different countries,  because the site  wasn't really clicking yesterday.  Yeah.  But I was watching  some clips from London  and from Moscow  and from Mexico.  And you don't understand 
[00:29:00]  a word they're saying,  but just to see the way  the rest of the world  was covering it.  But as you could see,  that wasn't a plane.  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  Five years later,  Ventura said that.  Ventura went down there  and didn't notice  anything was wrong.  Yeah.  That SEAL training  really paid off  while you were in the rubble  you didn't notice.  I listened to a college student.  I watched his video.  It's terrific.  Good for you.  God bless.  Exactly what happened.  Of course it is.  He was a governor.  Yeah.  Oh, was that the second one?  Oh, boy.  When you see the close-ups 
[00:29:30]  of that fucking smoke  pouring out,  like when you could see  people waving.  Oh, that was the baddest.  That was the worst.  But I think  the American news  didn't show the jumpers  as much as the other ones.  No, the other countries  love it.  But I think they should have  because it's horrific.  But to me,  those videos  are what has just  continued to fuel  my fucking desire  to see the mentality  that did it  just wiped off  the face of the earth.  See what the,  because they have no clue  what's going on at this point.  See what they say  right after the second plane hit.  From ABC. 
[00:30:00]  Then they've got to be like,  oh, boy.  And we have to underline this.  We are dealing  purely in the realm  of speculation  as to what the second one  and then they're like,  all right,  no more speculation.  Major incident occurred here  on the upper floors  of one of the  World Trade Center towers.  You can see multiple openings  and flames coming out  of at least two sides  of the tower  at the World Trade Center.  Hear that siren?  Go ahead.  That guy's alive.  The Associated Press  is now reporting  that it was an aircraft.  So that's one more  witness weighing in 
[00:30:30]  or at least one more  source weighing in  on the fact  that it was an aircraft  of some kind.  And as Don Daler reported,  this occurred about  15 or 20 minutes ago.  All right.  You got to go forward now.  And New York time,  that would have been  about 20 minutes or a quarter.  There's any kind  of effort up there.  Go back a little.  In those high floors,  there are places  where tourists team  in the morning,  even if the regular workers  weren't in.  This ain't going to be good.  Remind you again  that there was  a terrorist bomb 
[00:31:00]  that did go off  at the World Trade Center.  Muslims.  Even then,  the graphics  were fucking in the way.  In the garage level,  but we have no reason.  No indication  that this could have been  related to that.  Oh, no indication  at all  that this could have been  a terrorist event.  ABC's Don Naylor  who is on the scene.  Don, just give me  some description again  of what you can see now.  What we're seeing,  it appears that  there is more  and more fire and smoke  enveloping the very top  of the building.  And as fire crews  are descending  on this area.  Where was the second plane 
[00:31:30]  that you saw, Sam?  How far?  There's any kind of  up there yet.  Now remember,  oh my God.  That looks like  a second plane.  Did it?  I did not see  a plane go in.  That just exploded.  You just saw  another plane  coming in from the side.  You did?  That was out of  absolute amount of view.  Yes, and that's  the second explosion.  You can see the plane  coming in just from  the right-hand side  of the screen.  So this looks like  it is some sort  of a concerted  effort to attack 
[00:32:00]  the World Trade Center  that is underway  in downtown New York.  To hear the news people  in the background  were pretty much  unflappable.  I know, yeah.  That's the worst part  of it.  To make sure we saw  what we saw.  Oh yeah,  re-roll that please.  Let's make sure  we saw what we saw.  I thought it was  some sort of fire  equipment coming in  or some sort of  observation plane  but it was obviously  designed to attack  the World Trade Center.  We're going to show you that.  Here's a replay  of the videotape.  It just barrels in. 
[00:32:30]  How do you say  that didn't happen?  A good-sized plane  came in.  Oh, the trousers.  No, no, that was  obviously a...  Shut up.  They're just assholes.  They're assholes.  They really are.  How could you look at that?  How would you buy into that?  How could you look at that  as it unfolded  and say it didn't happen?  Because they're irrational  fucking assholes.  Fuckheads.  Oh, God.  I wouldn't mind them so much  if they just,  when you present a point to them  they would address it.  Yeah, yeah.  But they just,  again, they're like little kids. 
[00:33:00]  Fuck them.  You know what, too?  Over the years,  I think one good thing,  they've lost a lot  of their dumb-ass credibility  they had during their 15 minutes.  Because, believe me,  there are still people  that don't believe it happened.  But now you look at them  and they're like,  shut up.  Shut up.  Come on.  They pawed over it enough  where you know  that it was two planes.  Every dumb theory  has been debunked.  Flown by savage animals.  They landed the plane  in Cleveland somewhere.  Yeah, the people got off.  Taking the voicemails.  Yeah, a couple of people  lost their luggage. 
[00:33:30]  They were very angry.  Nothing happens in Cleveland  if a plane landed.  Trust me, people would know.  Yeah, Cleveland stinks.  But it's amazing how that,  remember we would argue  with those little ones,  the sulking,  the one who thought  he was like a deep thinker.  All right.  Gatekeeper.  Am I a gatekeeper?  Okay, cool.  That sounds cool.  I like being a gatekeeper.  Do you know how many times  he's yelled at his own parents?  I guarantee you  he'd call mommy and daddy  gatekeepers many times  when they're like,  get back in your room.  You're a gatekeeper.  Gatekeeper, man. 
[00:34:00]  By the way,  I've been trying to watch  Ron Paul stuff  because I do kind of  like the guy.  Oh, boy.  You don't like his  religious outlook  on stem cell research  and fetuses.  No.  But I will say  that too many of the people  that support him I hate.  Like the truthers support him.  I know.  He has too many  annoying people supporting him.  But his lack of,  it's funny,  I was Twittering last night.  I kind of,  I like him because  he answers questions  honestly and directly.  I don't think Ron Paul  is phony at all.  I think he's very to the point  and I think he's very truthful. 
[00:34:30]  Like he just answers  the question.  And he economically  knows what he's talking about.  Yeah.  He knows the economy.  He understands all this stuff.  And he,  he said,  when they said,  what would you do?  He doesn't give fucking,  well,  America's gonna win.  He just says,  this is what I would do.  You have to do this  to stop the dollar.  You have to,  you know,  he has real tangible answers.  Yeah.  That you can like or dislike.  And then I Twitter,  like I don't like anybody  who doesn't believe in evolution.  I just,  I,  to me they lose a certain amount.  And then some guy Twitter  would be like,  look,  who cares if he thought  Jesus Christ rode around  on a dinosaur. 
[00:35:00]  He could fuck my mother  if he fixes the country.  That's a good point.  Yeah.  Good point, sir.  Yeah.  He's,  he's a guy that could probably  get the country back  economically on its feet.  But he's such a kind of a,  he's a little odd.  Look,  look,  and I know there's people out there  that are hardcore Ron Paul people.  I hear from all the time.  Anthony,  why aren't you backing Ron Paul?  He's got a great outlook  on the Second Amendment,  which I love.  Yes.  But he's,  he's a little,  he's a little wacky.  I think, 
[00:35:30]  I absolutely think,  a ticket that will win  right now  is,  is,  geez,  I was just saying it.  Perry?  Before,  yeah,  Perry as president though.  And then Romney  as vice president.  Perry and Romney  I think is a good  Republican ticket  that,  that could actually  pretty easily  beat  a dummy  Obama in there.  Who,  by the way,  I think anybody  could beat him right now.  If the election were held tomorrow,  a hedgehog would win. 
[00:36:00]  He's in trouble.  You know,  yeah,  but he doesn't have the support  with even his court anymore.  The blacks don't want,  the blacks wanted a black president.  They got one.  Now it's like,  nah.  And they realize,  like we said years ago,  that their lives,  their lives didn't change.  No,  their lives didn't change.  We said that on day one.  A lot of people  are going to be disappointed  because their lives  are not going to drastically change.  Yeah.  They really thought  their lives were going  to drastically change.  Not just blacks,  a lot of people.  Remember that?  Oh,  now I don't have to worry  about paying my mortgage  and gasoline. 
[00:36:30]  Remember that woman?  Oh,  she was great.  And I was sitting there  seething watching her.  Those people will just not vote  in the next election.  They won't come out.  No,  that's it.  He got a lot of people out to vote  that normally wouldn't vote.  They voted because,  absolutely because they wanted  a black president.  And now they're disappointed  and they're not going to vote again.  It was a 98% black vote.  Every black that voted,  it was 98% of them  voted for Obama.  Now you're telling me  that's not racially fucking motivated?  Of course it is. 
[00:37:00]  They're not all going to come out  for the second run  at a second term for this guy.  It was a great big thing  for the blacks.  They looked,  they went,  oh,  look at us.  We can watch a black guy  being inaugurated in half.  And that was it.  They're not going to get him out again.  Oh,  we got a teacher on the line.  He has to teach 9-11  very differently.  This is Chris the teacher  in Massapequa.  What do you,  what do you got to teach?  Hey,  come on,  bro.  I don't want to,  you know.  No,  I mean, 
[00:37:30]  what do you have?  What fakeness,  what political correct bullshit  do you got to shove down  these little cocks throats?  Huh?  Oh,  shove cocks down  these little fucks throats.  What?  I'm not happy about it,  dude.  It's just what I have to do.  I know,  I know.  You understand.  What is it?  There's a website.  It's called Brain Pop.  And there's a video about,  it's kind of like a,  like a cartoon video  about 9-11  for informational for kids. 
[00:38:00]  I think you should play  the audio of it.  How long is it?  Maybe two minutes.  Oh,  fuck,  let's play this thing.  And it might be a little longer.  I have to do it on Friday.  I've been mandated  to teach it on Friday.  Okay,  okay,  okay.  Hang on the line,  we'll be right with you.  Let's move this forward.  So,  we're about to play something  that you absolutely have to play  for your students,  right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's listen to this.  Stay on the line.  It says,  this movie explores  a sensitive subject.  It's like,  it's an outline of  Statue of Liberty.  And please watch this movie  with an adult 
[00:38:30]  and take time to discuss it.  Click here to continue.  Oh, shit,  who are we going to get?  This is going to drive me nuts.  I already know it.  I already fuck you.  Well, let's see.  I got an open mind right now.  Let's do this.  It's a cartoon.  The Mysteries of Life  with Tim and Moby.  Moby.  B-Bee.  He's wearing a 9-11 shirt.  Yeah.  They're down by the site.  I think this is it.  You think?  He's a robot.  A guy and a robot.  Dear Tim and Moby,  I know that the Twin Towers 
[00:39:00]  fell on 9-11,  but why would someone do that?  Uh-oh.  From Tiffany.  Okay.  Let's find out why.  This is a tough one.  Maybe we should go over  what happened first.  Okay.  The morning of September 11, 2001  started off as your average Tuesday.  People went to work,  kids went to school,  and pretty much everyone  went about their business as usual.  At 8.46 a.m., though,  everything changed.  Sure.  At that moment, 
[00:39:30]  an airplane full of passengers  flew into one of the Twin Towers.  Those were the two tallest structures  of the World Trade Center  in downtown New York City.  All of the people in the plane were killed,  and so were many of the people in the building.  Mm-hmm.  I know.  I hate the fuck.  The robot was sad.  Then, about 20 minutes later,  a second plane flew into the other tower.  Mm-hmm.  It was then that people started to realize  that this was no accident.  Right.  It was an attack.  It was clear that the planes 
[00:40:00]  had been hijacked  or forcefully taken over.  Shortly after that,  there was another plane crash,  but this time it was at the Pentagon,  right outside Washington, D.C.  Something's a little missing.  The Pentagon is the headquarters  of the U.S. Department of Defense.  There's something missing so far,  but I'm sitting waiting.  Next, the unthinkable happened.  What?  Back in New York,  the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed.  Looks fun in a cartoon.  It was a devastating flow.  Yeah, it doesn't look that bad.  Debris flew everywhere,  and all of downtown Manhattan  was covered in a cloud of...  The cartoonist sucks. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He had the smoke collapse.  He should have got Coke Logic to do it.  Why would the smoke collapse  with the building?  I know.  It's terrible.  The smoke collapsed with the building.  That's what's really bothering me  about this so far.  Yeah, the animation is really bad.  I'm very upset and offended.  They show the tower collapsing  and just kind of disappearing  into the ground,  and the smoke goes with it  and disappears into the ground.  It's a lovely afternoon above it.  Now it's beautiful again.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Sorry.  Out of dust and smoke. 
[00:41:00]  Mm.  Fortunately,  most people were able  to get out of the tower  before it fell,  but many others,  including firefighters  and police officers  who had gone in to help,  were trapped  and killed.  Oh.  The robot's sad again.  Well, the building  had actually been designed  to handle small crashes,  but nothing like this.  The fuel from the airplane  ignited an enormous fire  that destroyed  the skyscraper's  internal structure.  It was the same problem  at the North Tower,  and at 10.28 a.m., 
[00:41:30]  it too collapsed.  Oh, boy.  The smoke.  The smoke.  Hundreds of people  lost their lives  in an instant.  No more smoke.  All right.  Around the time  of the South Tower's collapse,  another plane crashed  in an empty field  in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  This fourth hijacked plane  was most likely intended  to hit another building,  but evidence suggests  that passengers  took the plane over  from the hijackers,  causing it to crash.  So far, so good.  There were no survivors.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What about sad again?  All told,  almost 3,000 civilians 
[00:42:00]  lost their lives that day.  Mm-hmm.  It was the worst attack  on U.S. soil  since the bombing  of Pearl Harbor  in Hawaii in 1941.  Can you pause just one second?  I just want to point out  how much I also hate  that fucking sad sack robot.  He looks like Iron Man  with Down Syndrome.  The fucking sad sack robot  and those little  sounds you're hearing.  He has three little lights  on his chest.  And I guess that's  the robot being sad,  but he has a perpetual  robot frown.  Yeah.  It's the best thing  you come up with.  I don't like the robot. 
[00:42:30]  It's a Ted Sheckler  robot face.  Robot's an idiot.  You know, when you hear  3,000, it's horrible,  but it's amazing  that it wasn't so much  and so many more people.  Well, when they were,  if you remember the newscast,  remember,  we're thinking 20,000 people  at least.  Still way too many,  obviously, but fuck.  You really think about  how many it could have been.  Let's see what they say  for the motive.  I'm hoping they do it right.  Even if they do it nicely,  I'm hoping they do it right.  I want it to be angry.  I want to see like  some kind of fucking thing  that's as bad  as the Nazis made 
[00:43:00]  Jewish propaganda posters look.  That's why I want to see  cartoon Arabs.  Right, so let's talk  a little bit about  why all this happened.  Oh, let's.  The hijacking of planes  like this  is a form of terrorism.  Yeah.  You should see our  terrorism movie  to learn more,  but the main idea  is that terrorism  is an act of violence  designed to spread  fear in others  and to attract attention  to a political cause.  Hmm.  Or religious.  We now know  that the September 11th 
[00:43:30]  attacks were carried out  by 19 members  of a terrorist network  called Al-Qaeda.  The main goal  of Al-Qaeda  is to make countries  that are predominantly Islamic  get rid of all  non-Islamic influences.  Wow.  Thank you.  Wow.  Oh, Islam is one  of the most popular  religions in the world.  Is it?  It's practiced  by around 1.5 billion people  known as Muslims  in countries  all over the globe.  The vast majority  of Muslims  are non-violent.  Of course.  And they do not agree  with Al-Qaeda  or its actions. 
[00:44:00]  Of course not.  You hear it every day  from, oh, that's right.  The Quran, the Holy Book of Islam  calls for Muslims  to be peaceful.  Right.  Unless maybe there's a rape  or something  and then it calls for  a stoning of the woman  or beheadings  are completely,  that's fair game.  I don't like  the little fucking PSA  they're doing about Islam,  but at least they said  they were Islamic.  It's like,  it's annoying me,  but all right.  I gotcha.  Well, I'm just,  I'm probably thinking  of how my cartoon would be.  It would be a little different.  You're right.  This one is, you know, 
[00:44:30]  they gotta be,  because there's probably  Muslim kids in the class.  It's like,  you don't want them  to be outcast.  It's not that bad.  Punched in the face  after this is over.  It's not that bad.  No.  I thought it would be  way, way worse.  Al-Qaeda wants to rid  the Islamic world  of Western ideas,  especially of anything  from the United States.  Yeah, we suck.  They also want Muslim countries  to be governed  by fundamentalist rule.  Fundamentalism  is a radical form  of any religion  that holds to a very  strict interpretation  of the religion's rules.  It usually gives power  to some 
[00:45:00]  and denies basic  civil liberties  to everyone else.  Ah.  Unfortunately,  Al-Qaeda followers  have proven  that they're willing  to do anything,  including commit suicide  and kill innocent people  to get their message heard  and their goals met.  That's where the kids  will start crying.  Good question.  You might have heard  that a man named  Osama bin Laden  was responsible  for the events  on 9-11.  Osama bin Laden  was the head  of the Al-Qaeda network.  It's almost done.  He didn't personally  take part in the attacks,  but as Al-Qaeda's leader, 
[00:45:30]  bin Laden helped plan  and carry the whole thing out.  Well,  the United States  responded to 9-11  by invading Afghanistan,  a country that was  harboring Al-Qaeda members.  Much of Al-Qaeda's  organization was destroyed  and certain key leaders  were killed.  After nearly a decade  in hiding,  Osama bin Laden  was eventually found  and killed  by the U.S. government,  but the Al-Qaeda network  is still very much alive.  Back home,  it's been hard to rebuild.  Many lives were shattered 
[00:46:00]  in the aftermath  of the September 11th attacks,  but families,  friends,  and complete strangers  pulled together  to help out relatives  and friends of the victims,  both on the day  of the attacks  and in the weeks  and months of Wallet.  Within a year,  all physical damage  to the Pentagon  was repaired.  It's been a much tougher  rebuilding process  here in New York,  but things are looking up.  Oh,  robots got two condoms.  By the way,  I love the U.S. shirts.  I couldn't agree more. 
[00:46:30]  And the robots  got kind of a smile now.  It was nice to see  the robots fucking thin.  That wasn't bad.  No,  that was fine.  He turned that frown  upside down.  That's fair.  Yeah.  I like a happy robot.  A lot of teachers  checking in saying  they use this brain pop  all over the fucking place.  That ain't bad.  But that wasn't  groveling and annoying  like I thought it would be.  I think that was pretty fair.  At least they brought up  the Islamic fundamentalists.  That was fine.  Yeah,  that was fine.  Yeah,  sure.  They did put something  together on the History Channel.  It's not about  the towers falling. 
[00:47:00]  It's actually about  the rebuilding  and it's pretty cool  if I can use that word.  I don't know if that's  sacrilegious in saying it,  but  it's basically talking about  the memorial  and what they're doing  underground  and about how like  this architect made it  so that the sun  shines through this area  at the exact time  that the planes were hit.  Oh,  I know.  I saw that  and then Indy puts a staff  there,  right?  And it shows where  the Ark of the Covenant is.  Hilarious.  I love that. 
[00:47:30]  No,  Anthony,  it wasn't that.  Oh,  you sound like the guy  narrating the fucking  brain pop.  So you're making us all  have sad Down Syndrome  robot faces,  sir.  Anthony,  I'm in school right now.  You want me to give  your number to anybody?  Oh,  Jesus.  Like they don't already have it.  I have to go be a subpar  to you.  Thank you,  buddy.  I'll do that.  Two beeps equals happy robot.  Spectro talks.  Spectro.  He talks robot. 
[00:48:00]  Ah,  there you go.  So 9-11 is Sunday,  yeah?  Yeah,  and we,  that was our big tribute  right there.  Watching a cartoon.  Play the beepity beep robot.  I hate that robot.  I watched horrid animation.  I think it's just  kind of an embarrassment  ten years later  that's not complete  down there.  Yeah.  But that's all that  New York City bullshit  tape that we see  all the fucking time  in this city.  How about,  for patriotism,  how about this?  Instead of running the names  of the people who died,  which we've seen already,  how about if you really  want people to remember, 
[00:48:30]  you then show all  of the fucking,  of the lawyers  that like made sure  that that guy got a blank check  while they got their  referral fees.  Right.  And they have to get paid,  but how about,  let's see the big discounts  they're giving these people  when a guy gets a judgment  and a third goes to this lawyer  and then a big piece  of the referral  goes to that lawyer.  Let's see how many lawyers  have made a certain amount  of money off this.  Pigs.  Yeah,  you want to tell everybody  to remember,  show the names of the lawyers  that have made  and show how much money  they've made.  All right.  Bastards.  Ah, 
[00:49:00]  we'll all be watching Sunday,  huh?  Nah,  I swear,  I'm not.  Well,  football's on,  but you know,  football's got to make,  you know,  they'll have something.  Yeah.  Now a moment of silence.  Now,  a moment of silence.  Yeah.  Jets flying by stadiums,  that whole thing probably.  Flybys?  You think we'll see some flybys?  We'll do some flybys.  Those are fun.  The horrifying 80,000 people  will hear their planes coming.  I don't know if people  need to hear that.  Whitney Houston,  get her to sing again.  Post crack Whitney? 
[00:49:30]  I don't know.  I don't think she could  sing that song anymore.  You don't think she could  pull it off like she did?  No.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  The day.  Part of what?  The first Gulf War?  Yeah.  It was the Whitney Houston thing?  That was her big one.  That was amazing,  though.  Yeah,  that one lasted for quite a while.  You gotta admit,  that was amazing.  She pulled it off.  Holy shit.  Nah.  I gotta eat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got my foods.  I gotta get my food on,  Sam.  Speaking in the vernacular 
[00:50:00]  of the Sam Roberts.  I gotta get my food on,  yo.  You wanna talk about  the moon photos next?  Yeah,  I just saw it again  on TV.  This stuff is fantastic.  You wanna talk about  the moon photos?  It's right up my alley.  I love it.  Yeah,  let's do that.  The conspiracy guys  aren't looking good  these days.  Well,  you know,  they'll undermine this  and say it's fake,  but I find it fascinating.  Yeah,  we'll talk about  the moon photos next.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  The virus. 
[00:50:30]  Morning,  everyone.  Hey,  we got Emmett Smith  coming in today.  Yes.  Jimmy's very excited.  Very happy.  Football,  of course,  a football player extraordinaire.  Leading rusher  a long time.  Really?  Yep.  Emmett Smith is  as good as you can get.  Who's number two?  Walter Payton.  Yep.  Wow.  Sammy Sweetheart  also in studio today.  Huh?  From the Jersey Shore.  All right.  That crying mess  will be in studio.  You don't watch 
[00:51:00]  the Jersey Shore,  do you?  No,  not really.  Sammy Sweetheart  is pining over Ron  or Ronnie  and she pretty much  ruins the entire  fucking show,  but she'll be in today.  Am I right,  Sam?  Well,  I don't know.  She certainly  skewed the direction  of the show.  It used to be just like  Pauly D in the situation  being goofy,  but now it's more  centered around  Sammy Sweetheart  pining after Ronnie.  Pining is right.  Pining.  She's a sap.  There's pining going on?  And I guess they're  back together, 
[00:51:30]  although I'm behind  a couple episodes  as far as the season goes.  Well,  let me tell you,  on again,  off again is the only  way I can describe  that relationship.  Wow.  Look out.  And she's really  fucking hot,  man.  Yeah.  What is wrong with her?  She was like the cute girl  on season one  and the situation  liked her and everything.  Now she's just a mess.  Oh,  shit.  I mean,  emotionally.  Oh,  okay.  She still looks good.  She's got nice legs.  Let's see a picture.  Pump it up there,  my friend.  You don't even know  what she looks like? 
[00:52:00]  I do.  I just want to see  a recent one.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Something I can,  you know.  You don't like  trash TV,  do you,  Ant?  Some I do.  Well,  you watch the Tiaras.  I like the Toddlers  and Tiaras.  That's hilarious.  So that's trash TV.  There's Sammy Sweetheart.  And Dance Moms now.  That's a new one.  That's a good one.  What's Dance Moms?  They got a bunch of girls  and the moms  are very angry  when the big fat pig  that runs the dance studio  puts the other daughters  in like dance recitals. 
[00:52:30]  Ah.  And then in between,  it's just young girls  in leotard  and little shorts  doing backbends  and flips  and shit like that.  Yeah.  Speaking of dancing,  Chaz Bono's in the paper today.  That thing is more of a man  than I am.  How does that happen?  Boy,  those hormones  are really taking effect.  Grows a better beard  than I do.  What the fuck?  Yeah,  I got that big,  that cover,  that big fat neck beard  going. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It still doesn't look  like a man.  I don't know, man.  Did you see the picture  in today's paper?  It's getting scary.  Is it?  You would swear  it was a man.  Really?  You would swear  it was a man  if it was walking  down the street  and you didn't know  it was Chaz Bono.  That's just it,  yeah.  You would swear  that's a guy.  Maybe I just know  the Chaz Bono thing  and it's hard  to separate it now.  Can you go from  girl to guy  better than guy to girl?  I think so.  I think you go  from girl to guy  easier than guy to girl.  I've seen the girl to guy  thing where they have 
[00:53:30]  full beards and mustaches  and stuff,  so it's just,  it's,  yeah,  yeah,  it's probably easier  to pull off.  Is it gay to suck  Chaz's penis?  Still a vagina.  No penis.  Oh, no?  No penis.  They couldn't figure that part out.  They didn't want to go  for a sex change.  Oh, okay.  So there's a hole there.  Yeah.  Look at that thing.  That is a man.  It's just odd  to have the vagina though.  Why would anybody call,  you can't call Chaz a he  if there's a vagina. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  They do.  You can't though.  You can't though.  Why would you?  If you have a pussy,  just be a she with a beard.  Don't call yourself a he.  Just be a you,  be a she,  but have a beard.  It's like,  you don't have to say  you're a he.  Yeah, you're right.  You have a pussy,  it's fine.  Look at that beard thing.  Why would you chop the tits off  and not add the penis?  I'm guessing the surgery,  probably because Chaz is heavy.  It would probably be  like a lot of fatty pubis.  Just use the pubis  to make a penis.  I heard in an interview  that Chaz does not want  the penis. 
[00:54:30]  Why doesn't he want the penis?  She.  Why doesn't she want the penis?  It wants the vagina.  Why does it want the vagina?  I have no idea.  It didn't go.  I was trying for that.  I lost interest.  You didn't want to go with it.  Kevin from Connecticut  answered your question, Jimmy.  It's gay to suck any penis.  Well,  let Judge Bell,  will Kevin say  what Judge Bell will come in?  We'll know more tomorrow,  by the way,  but we're getting word  that we wanted to play  9-11 footage  from our, 
[00:55:00]  from WNEW,  the day.  And it looks like,  I'm going to find out  today,  but it looks like  Sirius did the right thing  and went to CBS  and Mel even got involved  and the fucking,  and I'm hoping I'm wrong,  CBS lawyers  will not allow  us to play  the 9-11  show  for you  because of rights  and ownership.  Yeah,  they own everything.  But if that's the way it is,  people should very, 
[00:55:30]  very harshly respond  to CBS  and I won't know  until tomorrow.  Before I shoot  my big mouth off.  But glad to see  everybody's remembering.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's this fucking  phony thing  that Ant's talking about.  We're all talking about.  Where is it?  Where's the patriotism?  CBS, as we remember.  Yeah, how about you  let us remember and,  How about we all remember?  Not just some of us.  You know,  some people want to  remember too.  Yeah.  Yeah, how about,  how about,  that's what patriotic is.  is you tell the lawyers  to put aside  their fucking  blood-sucking greed 
[00:56:00]  and allow a show  to play  the 9-11.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  But if that's true  and their lawyers  really want money  to play that 9-11 audio  out of vindictiveness  or whatever,  then I think  the response from people,  Well, is Gary here?  Not yet.  Although I went and checked,  maybe he's taking a dump.  He may be here.  But I'll ask him.  All I'll say today  is if he wants respect,  get here early  because these things  come up.  No, he's got to stay  in his office.  I'm not saying  fucking hover.  But if you want 
[00:56:30]  respect from us,  be here.  We got things  that we need  to talk to you about.  Like what's going on  with this 9-11 audio  from CBO?  That's a done deal.  They will not go through.  Of course not.  Absolutely not.  I would love to see  what the publicist here.  I don't want to sleep  over any of that anymore  because there's no surprises  anymore.  The publicist here,  if that's the truth,  then she'd begin  making a fucking problem  about it  and going to the papers  with it.  Who's the publicist?  I don't even know.  Hillary's the publicist?  I believe so.  That's what they do.  And this is a story,  so you should shame  them publicly.  I thought she was  the lunch lady. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, no.  She's a publicist.  What?  Oh, we probably  shouldn't say that  because we need her now.  I didn't know  she was the publicist.  Yeah, she's the publicist.  Really?  She gets the photographers  to come in here now,  gets our opening  and make pictures  up on Getty Images.  Nice.  Did she help us out  with the brochure placement?  Because I like  the brochure placement.  I do too.  That's a good one.  I have it with me.  Jimmy brought it in.  Yes, I do.  I was perusing it  a little bit  and wow. 
[00:57:30]  This lasted a day  and a half.  Oh.  Yeah, this is great.  It's good to have,  I understand,  again, certain pictures.  I understand Stern  on the cover.  I understand even Eminem.  Is this a new brochure?  Maybe it's an old brochure.  I got this in the mail  two days ago.  So it's a new brochure.  Okay.  I understand that  because even though  Eminem is never here,  he's a marketable  household name.  Like, I get that  from a marketing point of view.  I don't get that at all.  Sorry.  I know, but for marketing,  I do.  The guy should at least  do one fucking show  a week to be represented  on a brochure.  But it's about selling units. 
[00:58:00]  It's like,  this is what people  are going to look at.  He's gone over a year  without even his voice  on his own fucking channel.  Again,  and makes way more  than we do,  by the way,  for doing absolutely  fucking nothing  for this company.  But what really bothers me  is that the inside,  when you go inside  the brochure,  like,  I like Cousin Brucie a lot  as a guy  and I think he's a legend.  But why is there  a picture of Cousin Brucie  blown up  when the majority  of people buying  satellite units,  even though he's a legend, 
[00:58:30]  aren't in his demo?  People who are in this demo  are buying them.  Right.  It's just a weird thing.  I don't even think,  I honestly don't think  Mel and Scott look at this  and go,  fuck Opie and Anthony.  I think this is  whoever just makes  the brochures.  Whoever designs  the brochures  just doesn't give a shit  about this show.  And this is like  every other corporation,  50 different heads  doing 50 different things  and not one guy  overlooking everything  and saying,  look,  do the right thing.  Well,  that's why we need  a guy  that comes in early  and works on this stuff. 
[00:59:00]  A guy.  Well,  he could be working  on the brochure  and he could be working  on the 9-11 stuff,  but he's not at work yet.  Even though his main  responsibility  is us  and we're only here  from 6 to 10.  The 9-11 shit,  I could just see  like that never happening.  Of course not.  There's no communication  that can make that happen.  Of course.  Unless,  I have one shot,  which I'll try today.  It may not help.  Well,  you got a little  something something?  What's that?  What is it?  You know somebody?  Who do you know?  I'm going to drop a few names. 
[00:59:30]  I won't say it.  What do you got?  You're going to write it down?  I'll write it down.  And it may mean nothing.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing.  Mm-hmm.  Do you have allergies?  I have no idea.  I'm either,  I have allergies today  or I'm officially getting  sick as we speak.  Oh, no.  I hope you're not getting sick.  I hope not.  Make sure you get plenty of rest.  Tomato soup is good, too.  Oh, right.  Your handwriting sucks.  I'm just jotting down things quickly. 
[01:00:00]  You're ready, though, right?  I think.  Yeah.  I got it.  Yeah.  Possibility.  I will say.  Yeah, I could be getting,  I could be getting a cold  right now as we speak.  Happened right there  in the elevator.  Don't get me sick.  I hope not.  I don't want to get anybody sick.  All right.  I didn't know.  It happened when I got  off the elevator.  I have two,  I have two.  There's like four sneezes  and now I can't stop sneezing  and my eyes  and no,  it feels like I have to itch  the back of my head, 
[01:00:30]  like the back of my face.  That's where the hand is.  I want to get out.  That's allergies, my friend.  I want to get in there  and just scratch the inside.  They said all this rain  would bring some allergies  to the surface.  Allergy sufferers  would be hurting.  You're Yankees.  Yeah.  I see you got the hat on  and everything there,  the cap.  Yankees.  Two and a half  ahead of the socks.  Can someone explain  why Major League Baseball  decided that it was  a very, very good idea  to start the Yankees game 
[01:01:00]  last night  after a four hour  and 15 minute rain delay,  I believe?  Yeah, the game was shorter  than the rain delay.  The game was like three hours  and the rain delay  was like four hours,  over four hours.  So after over four hour  rain delay,  Major League Baseball decided,  yeah, let's play this game  on a Tuesday night  starting at 11.05 at night.  Yeah.  So that means everyone  that couldn't hang in there,  they'd just lose  that money, right?  Well,  How does that work?  Yeah, a lot of people left. 
[01:01:30]  I think there were  about 100 people left  watching.  They said 500 people  in the stadium  for the Yankees game  last night.  Here's the deal  they're giving people.  If you had a ticket  to that game,  whether it was used  or not used,  you can get another ticket  for a game next season.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So they're going to  have a make good  next season for that game.  Okay, so we always point out  when everyone's being shitty.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good thing right there.  At least they try  to do something.  Trying to do something.  But wow, yeah,  what a late game. 
[01:02:00]  It ended at 315, 320  in the morning.  With a fab three victory.  Plus this late in the season,  you don't want to have  to do a double header  with the Orioles.  No, I think they got  a matinee game today, though.  They were up late  and they got a matinee today.  Really?  If, you know,  and I think the rain  should stop, so.  But two and a half  ahead of the Sox,  which is good.  Sox, I think,  won last night also.  You know, they should be  playing the World Series  this week.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, why compete  with football? 
[01:02:30]  People like the World Series,  though.  But the World Series,  you do now.  Nice.  Yeah.  Over by Friday,  give everyone a break  for a day,  and then football starts.  Although football starts,  what, Thursday?  It's got to be there.  Don't they start it  on a Thursday, usually?  First game?  I'd rather not say.  It's October.  October's the fucking time.  But why compete?  It can't be September.  And your season  before the other season starts.  They call Reggie Mr. August?  That would have been terrible.  Mr. August.  That is horrible.  August means nothing.  It's not August. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's always funny  when a player stunk,  they would call him  like Mr. April.  Oh, I love that.  When he was great  in the first month.  Yeah, that's A-Rod  they call him that.  Oh, Mr. April?  Yeah, Mr. April.  Fuck him.  A-Rod.  A-Rod.  I haven't heard that lately.  You want to know  why they didn't cancel  the game  or it doesn't matter?  Mr. Injury.  Why didn't they cancel?  Oh, and the seats.  Okay, there is a couple  phone calls we should take.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Ken and Jersey.  Because you just said  how nice it is  they could use their ticket  for next year.  Well, I was saying  it's a little like off.  I didn't say it's nice.  But at least they...  Wow, next year you get...  But at least they try  to do something.  But now Ken is basically  going to like say  fuck that.  Poo poo on it.  Yes, Ken?  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, the only tickets  you can get I think  are the shit ones.  You could trade them in for  like...  Did they say that on him?  The shit ones.  What tickets are you...  I got the shit ones.  John Sterling actually said 
[01:04:00]  you know what heaven.  Redeem this for one shit ticket.  That one just...  What a shot right into  the shit ones.  Into the shit seats.  Yeah, no surprise.  Alright.  It can't just be  something really nice.  So if you had a nice  ticket to the game.  Yeah.  Solid look at our seats  type of ticket.  Now you're in the shit seats.  Okay, that ain't good.  Alright.  Technically it's a rain delay  though.  It's like you know what?  Stick around.  Four hours and 15 minutes.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Who the fuck would  give a shit about the game  at that point?  No.  Except for the unemployed.  Well.  We're on.  Travis loves the Baltimore,  right?  That's right he does.  Is that why he's not here today?  He went to the game last night  and he's tired?  Yes.  Damn.  Yes it is.  He's got no spirit that can...  When can we start  taking days off again  by the way?  I mean theoretically  if you have the days  you can take them off  tomorrow.  You know we took  a really long vacation?  I know.  We're just scrounging  for more days. 
[01:05:00]  It's short sighted.  Oh it's so terrible.  Why?  I'm just asking.  Yeah.  Oh shit.  That was the weirdest one.  I swear it felt like a small...  What happened?  It felt like a small needle.  Yeah.  It just got stuck about  an inch and a half  up my nostril  and it made my eyes  shit like Popeye  and I went...  I made a sound.  It is terrible.  We should talk about  the moon photos Ant. 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  So what is this?  NASA?  Was this the NASA website  I was on checking this out?  Yeah.  NASA's got...  They have a great  fucking website.  Did you see the video?  I was away.  I was wondering  if you guys talked about it.  The black hole  sucking up a star video?  Oh man.  Is it that swirly one  where it's kind of...  It didn't even look real.  It looked like  it was a Hollywood movie.  Yeah.  But they're saying  that's real footage  of a black hole  sucking up a star?  It's gamma radiation  or something, right?  Did you see this?  And then we'll get  to the NASA photos. 
[01:06:00]  No, that's not footage.  That's an animation.  No, that's an animation.  I saw an actual video  and they were saying  this was the real deal.  Actual video  of a black hole  sucking up a star.  This is not the one  I saw either, Sam.  Sam's terrible  on the computer.  Sam is...  not the best  on the computer.  We have noticed  that over the years.  Well, there is no  real footage  of a black hole  only the effects it has.  Yeah.  This has to be 
[01:06:30]  at 1.9 million views.  There's really...  You can't see a black hole.  And who are the dicks  that dislike a video  that says  black hole destroying a star?  There's 121 out of 3,300.  How bad do you need  to be a hater  that you have to dislike  a video like this?  It's probably people  who have invested  on that star.  They thought  they were going  to build things.  Yes.  There's a black hole  eating it.  This is obviously  not real.  This is what astronomers  look for.  Now I know  why I disliked it.  That's the actual...  This isn't the one 
[01:07:00]  That's the actual sun.  Yeah.  That's our sun.  Yeah, this isn't  the one either.  I'll dislike it.  Yeah.  Just dislike it.  Just dislike it.  Very good.  I don't blame the people  You're Sammy Sweetheart  to me.  Where's the fucking video?  What was it called?  I don't know.  Black holes.  Star.  Black holes.  This big fucking  gaping going on.  Yeah.  Destroyed.  Something.  All right.  Well, what...  If you could find that,  Sam, that would be great.  But in the meantime,  the NASA photos of the moon.  Of the moon.  The moon.  They have a satellite. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And it's zipping around  the moon right now.  And it's taken some amazing  pictures and video  of the moon.  It's fantastic.  And what they're turning up  is landing spots  from the Apollo missions.  And you can see  the bottom of the lunar module,  the platform that they take off from  when they were down there,  footprints,  landing,  the lunar rover tracks 
[01:08:00]  from the little lunar rover  mobile they had.  And there was one picture  where you could see the flag.  That's how close they're getting  to looking at this.  And it's...  I mean,  like anyone,  doubted it with any brain.  But it's absolute proof  that we went to the moon.  So shut up.  Can I ask you...  You know the moon shit  way better than I do.  I love the moon shit.  Where were we landing  all this shit?  In the same area?  Nah, they were different areas.  But how far apart?  But pretty far apart.  All on the light side. 
[01:08:30]  No, I get that.  I know that much.  But they would just pick out  different flat areas.  Within a few miles  of each other?  Nah, a couple times  it was pretty far.  Really?  Hundreds of miles away.  Wow.  Yeah, they show them all.  They didn't show Apollo 11,  though.  I guess they haven't gotten there  yet to see this.  This being played  in extremely slow motion.  Footage of a black hole.  That's crazy.  Come on now.  Don't be silly. 
[01:09:00]  Nonsense.  That's not real.  Look at all the dislikes.  And then Rick Rolled.  You...  Wait a minute.  Sam.  You just...  You just put a site on  that showed a black hole  sucking up stars  which looked fake  right from the start.  And then...  You got Rick Rolled.  Because you guys  were still looking at it.  You guys were talking  about the videos.  You got Rick Rolled.  You got Rick Rolled.  You did get Rick Rolled.  You should have clicked on  in the first place.  You did get Rick Rolled.  You just said black hole star.  How many...  Why can't you find it? 
[01:09:30]  How many dislikes  on that one?  One more.  There better be.  Wait.  Look.  I got it.  It's fucking...  Dislike.  It's got 59 dislikes.  It even has a lot of dislikes.  And how about you  look at the comments first?  You were looking at it  so I left it up.  Look at the comments first.  What's the first comment say  on that one?  I didn't look at the comment.  I bet it says,  Oh, Rick Rolled.  Let's see.  I don't like Sam's sectioned thumb.  LOL.  His thumb really bugs me.  It says LOL.  See, you would have known  what's funny about a black hole.  Not even to hit play.  Put in a black hole sun. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, that's a good idea.  I love that.  Anyway,  so is there actual footprints  in these photos?  Yeah.  You could see where  they were traipsing around.  That's so wild.  Around the lunar module.  And then you could see  where the rovers went  pretty far away  from their vehicle.  Did any footprints disappear?  No.  Because that was the time  when somebody was carried  because something was happening  in their life  that they needed help with.  Oh, no, no, no.  There were no footprints  in the sand of the moon. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, okay.  And God does not wear space boots.  Okay.  Jesus.  So we knew it wasn't  Jesus carrying the astronaut.  Oh, I see.  That would be silly  if it was big.  How creepy would it be  if there were barefoot footprints?  Just barefoot footprints?  The footprints of Jesus?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  That would make me a believer.  That movie looks pretty cool.  I want to see that.  It's like Blair Witch  on the moon or something.  When is God going to  kind of like show us  he's real?  Really make a showing?  This is a great opportunity,  really, if you have  bare footprints on the moon, 
[01:11:00]  you'd be like,  holy shit,  only Jesus could have done that.  And you know,  either one,  bare like naked  or bare like a bear.  You'd both be like,  holy fuck.  A bear would be nice too.  Bare footprints?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yes.  Big Bear,  I was on the moon.  I'm getting the right link  from good old Kurt Love.  Oh, you got it?  Kurt Love.  Kurt Love.  I got to tell my train.  That one, 
[01:11:30]  yes.  You got it?  The black one right there,  Sam,  that down,  down,  meet the supernova black hole.  BBC.  BBC.  The BBC has no sense of humor,  so it's probably true.  72 dislikes.  Oh boy.  That's probably people  from a rival network.  BBC One and BBC Two,  just yelling at each other.  Yeah,  they're not.  What are they doing?  They're just talking  about black holes.  No, man.  He's boring Brits.  Take the X off,  Sam.  X out of the thing.  He leaves the little,  he leaves the ads  at the bottom of the...  What are you looking at?  Sam is the worst. 
[01:12:00]  Exactly.  When it comes to the internet.  He doesn't turn  the computer far enough.  You're watching a video  of British people  drinking champagne  and talking about black holes.  Why don't you zip on through it?  There we go.  I don't know.  Is that the one?  Go forward a little bit.  Yeah.  No, that's not the one  they saw.  That's not any of this.  You saw another one?  Yeah, I saw another one.  Maybe they don't have  any footage that close.  Maybe it was CGI.  It probably was.  And Kurt Love lied.  I don't have a link.  This is just going badly.  There is no footage  of a real...  How could there be? 
[01:12:30]  Well, you could see  what it does.  I think it's the gamma radiation  or whatever.  You could see the effects.  They don't have video, really.  I've seen photographs  of something that looks like  an entire galaxy  and something's reacting to...  It's reacting to something  pulling a piece of it  into space.  Can't tell if it's a joke  or what it's reacting to.  There you go.  Right.  They got video.  The astronauts use it  in space.  That's exactly true.  Oh, well.  I guess we're not going  to see this.  No.  Does it exist?  But the moon thing  is very cool. 
[01:13:00]  And the fact that  this many years later,  by the way,  you know,  we're talking  these things happened  in 69, 70, 71.  And the footprints  and the tire tracks  are still there  because there's nothing  to really affect them  unless a meteor  hits there.  Isn't that weird?  But no wind,  no erosion.  You don't get any rain weather.  So that shit  is just there  just like it was  when it was left there 
[01:13:30]  years ago.  Amazing.  And it leads  to the next  little subject.  Yeah.  Speaking of that,  over the vacation there,  did you see the pictures  of the dead bodies  on Mount Everest  that went around?  No.  I've seen one  or two years ago,  but there's better ones now.  A guy,  I don't know.  Does it just look like  they're really cold asleep,  right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  And they leave them there.  But they're explaining  this body is 67 years old  and it looked like  the guy died yesterday. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because of the climate,  obviously,  really creepy photographs.  Can you find that, Sam?  Really freezing cold,  zero humidity.  So they just sit there  and they pretty much  freeze dry.  Yeah.  They just get freeze dried  like a little sank.  And you're right,  they have to leave them there  because they don't  really have a choice.  It's too hard to  take the dead bodies down.  Although,  I was reading  an article  where they're going  to attempt  to take the dead bodies  off.  Because it's bumming  everybody out.  Is it bumming people  out when they walk up? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, that is kind  of a downer.  Imagine going into  a roller coaster  at Disney  and like five  of the seats,  there's just dead people  that died on the ride.  They can't figure out  how to get them  out of the seats.  And you've got to  get in there  and just be like,  well, eh.  No, it's a true story.  It's bumming everyone out  so they're going to get  the Serpas?  Serpas, yeah.  Or Sherpas.  I always get that  fucking wrong  every fucking time.  Yeah, Serpas  are going to water  with the Serp boards.  No, those are Serpers.  What do I know?  The Sherpas  are going to do it.  Get people out?  Yeah, they're going to get them.  Get that guy.  He looks like he's  kind of leaning  on his elbow. 
[01:15:00]  No, no, up there  to the left, left, left,  that guy.  Click on him.  I hate the way  Google Image opens pictures  and then shrinks them  and you have to X out.  I know.  Whoa.  He's like got a skull head  but it looks like  he was leaning forward.  Oh, I bet there was  something he was leaning on  like a thing of snow  that like blew away.  I sense frozen  or got away, yeah.  Because it looks like  he just collapsed  but look at him.  He's in his clothes.  He's just kind of  laying there  but his whole head is  like a skull face. 
[01:15:30]  Go to my Facebook  because it was a whole post  where it was like 25 bodies.  It's not too far down.  You've got to check this out.  Any groups of guys  have been going up there  and they see a body  and one guy creeps out  everybody else  like he'll see like  the one body  and say to his buddies  look at that guy  he looks like  he could probably  still suck his dick  he's so fresh.  And they're like what?  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  If he popped his dick out  it's frozen.  He'd probably suck it  he wouldn't get sick.  I bet we could look at it.  Just look at it.  See, you know.  I would love to see  the frozen penis  of a body like that. 
[01:16:00]  Here you go.  The dead bodies  of Mount Everest.  There's a whole fucking thing.  Look at that guy  that guy's just in the snow  in a little crevasse.  You've got to read some of the  this body's been named  Green Boots.  Many of the nearly  200 dead bodies  have been named  and are used as landmarks.  Can you imagine?  Make a left at Green Boots.  Oh shit.  Green Boots.  That's the guy we just saw.  Recovering a dead body  on Mount Everest  is a near impossibility.  It's like Skullhead.  Look at this guy  just fell over.  That's often 
[01:16:30]  a result of climbers  taking a nap  and never waking up.  Holy shit.  That's good.  Yeah, the Sherpa  should get them off.  Who's that guy?  It costs around  $25,000 to $60,000  to make a trip to the summit.  Sometimes it also  costs your life.  Your life.  Let's see what else  they got.  This guy.  Many climbers have said  that the hardest part  of climbing Mount Everest  for them  was passing all the graves.  They're not even graves.  They're dead people  laying up in the fucking snow.  Well, this guy's hanging  off his ropes and shit  off the side.  Oh, this is the one.  Due to extreme weather conditions, 
[01:17:00]  bodies that have been dead  for over 50 years  can still be found  with little decay.  Look at that guy.  Does he need his sunglasses  though at this point?  He still has his sunglasses on.  Yeah.  You take them off,  he goes, hey.  Yeah, my eyes hurt.  Instant frostbite  is a very real possibility  near the summit.  Like you just instantly  get frostbite.  Whoa, look at that guy's ass.  This is George Mallory  who fell to his death  in 1924.  24.  He's face down, right?  He's face down.  His back is exposed.  His clothes have been torn  probably from ridiculous winds 
[01:17:30]  and over the years  and his ass is hanging out.  That's a little embarrassing.  And it's got like  black spots on it where...  But besides that,  his skin is completely intact.  He died in 1924.  That's what,  87 years ago?  George Mallory.  Oh, boy.  Sometimes climbers  stumble upon men and women  who are dying on the mountain  but have no way  of helping them  and so they must  leave them to die.  Later, gator.  That's what I would say.  Who the fuck  This is a creepy one right here. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, man,  with the skull.  Two climbers  found a woman alone  and dying yelling,  please don't leave me  but were forced to continue on  and left her to die  as they had no means  to help her  and staying would risk  their own lives.  Whoa, is that her?  But they read below it, yeah.  They felt so guilty  they spent years  saving up enough money  to finally return  and give her  a proper burial.  I'd have looked at her tits.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right, maybe I wouldn't have.  But you do have to leave.  Like, who was the one  that made the phone call  from, he called his wife  while he was dying? 
[01:18:30]  Called for a pizza.  Yeah.  He said, we don't deliver that.  High up.  I read Into Thin Air.  What a great book.  Yeah, it was great.  Guy knew he was going to die.  There was no hope  of anyone getting to him in time  so he was able  to make a phone call  or whatever  and talk to his wife.  Sherpa went to him  but he was just too frozen.  He couldn't move.  Damn.  It's a sick book.  It's fucked up.  Yeah.  Really good.  Wow.  I was on Mount Everest  a couple times.  You see them bodies.  You're like,  you climbed to the summit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How long did you stay up there?  A few days. 
[01:19:00]  A few days?  How long do people  normally stay up there  when they hit the summit?  Oh, oh, minutes.  Minutes?  Less than an hour.  Yeah.  Wow.  So you stayed up  a few days, Chip?  Yeah, I was just,  I had my bag and stuff  with summer.  A few days.  Set up camp?  Yeah, just relax.  What's up, everybody?  What an ass.  He was summiting.  Everybody's summiting.  Yeah, it sounds fun.  How long could you stay  at the top?  I know it's very short.  You gotta climb right down.  Way less than an hour, man. 
[01:19:30]  You take a look,  take a couple pictures,  do what you have to do,  and get the fuck  out of there immediately.  You're where airliners fly.  Right.  Stop it.  I wonder what the longest  someone's,  has anyone stayed up there  overnight in the best  of weather conditions?  No, I think it would have  to be impossible.  Because those Sherpas  climb without equipment,  like they use equipment  but no oxygen sometimes?  They're fucking crazy.  Yeah.  Cray-cray.  Cray-cray.  How long?  How long is the longest  anyone has ever been up there?  I would say 20 minutes.  I'm saying. 
[01:20:00]  I'm going 20 minutes  you could hang out  on the tippy top.  I'm going to go  a little higher,  half hour.  Half hour?  That's it.  Does anyone know?  I'm going to say somebody.  Sam's eagerly looking it up.  Somebody has spent the night.  No.  Let's say,  God, Sam.  What are you looking up, Sam?  It's Mount Kilimanjaro.  It's the wrong place.  He's spelling Mount M-O-W-N-T.  We can't find it.  Whiskey on the Kilimanjaro  or something.  I don't know what that means.  I climbed that one too. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, like anthrax did it or something.  I used to climb a lot.  I have the answer.  Oh.  Oh.  Who's closest?  Are there for...  Wow!  Get the fuck out of here.  That ain't true.  What?  Oh, Babu.  Babu.  Babu.  Babu.  Come down from there, Babu.  He stayed up there for...  21 hours and a half.  21 and a half hours.  That's the record.  Yeah.  What's the average person, though? 
[01:21:00]  Jim Wins.  He's a Sherpa, by the way.  Yeah, of course he is.  Yeah, we're not talking about Sherpas.  Well, Jim Wins.  No, we said regular people.  You did not say that.  I went regular people.  Sherpas aren't human.  No, there's something weird going on there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Pressure doesn't affect them.  I wonder if you get bored after 18 hours on the summit.  What do you do up there?  You look around and just go, wow.  This is high.  Yeah, when do you get bored?  Let me turn around and look the other way.  Right.  It looks that way already.  All right.  I'm in the clouds. 
[01:21:30]  You can see my house from here.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, what do you do?  It'll be boring.  It's probably dangerous up there.  It's not like there's a lot of room to move around.  No chicks.  I wonder if someone is taking a piss on them.  I'm sure people pull their dick out on the summit.  If you pull your dick out on the summit, it would fall off.  It would instantly freeze, frostbite, and fall off.  They say there's a lot of duties on the trail.  Yeah.  Frozen duties.  You can probably pick them up and put them behind your ear.  They're all frozen.  What?  Make a duty hat.  Like a stogie.  Like a stogie. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, like the leprosy cigar and fucking...  Joe Rogan also had the black hole video.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Did Sam tell you this or Roland?  Oh, boy.  No, I don't think you did.  It was for...  No, I think it was me.  All right.  I'll get you something.  No, no, no.  That's good.  Can we find the black hole video?  Huffington Post has it.  Oh, it does?  Joe Rogan has it.  I still don't believe it.  AOL Huffington Post?  I don't believe it.  How about someone give us a fucking link?  Everybody knows where it is, but nobody can link it. 
[01:22:30]  From the Mod Squad?  No one will link it to us.  Thank you for wincing at that one.  That's your sausage or something?  You know what I said?  I heard you.  God damn.  Yeah, but the Nassau photo is worth checking out.  I saw it the other day and...  Fascinating.  I didn't see the footprints.  Love that.  Yeah, you can see them.  You got to, like, really blow it up.  Yeah.  This is audio.  Audio of what?  It's a story.  It's a news story.  Stellar Explosion and the Big Dippers. 
[01:23:00]  Stories.  It's NPR.  Oh, that should be exciting.  Oh, wow.  An explosion occurred.  There it was.  An explosion occurred.  You can't find it?  Where are the pictures?  Post Useless Without Pictures.  That's what I say.  Love those.  I think we're going to have to give up on the...  Yeah.  It's a black hole video.  Why everybody can find it so easily.  Everybody but me.  It's just not...  Ah, right.  In all fairness to Sam, not one fucking person sent the link in. 
[01:23:30]  No.  They all know where it is, but not one link, so...  No.  Let's listen to Dr. Peter Nugent talk about it.  Oh, my God.  You want to hear this?  Let's talk to Dr. Peter.  It's a rare opportunity for amateurs to see a supernova from Earth.  People all over the country will be able to catch a glimpse of the fireball from their  backyards as it reaches peak brightness over the next few nights.  Peter Nugent is an astronomer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.  He joins us from a studio there.  Dr. Nugent, thanks for being with us.  Black hole fever. 
[01:24:00]  So, in a galaxy like the Milky Way...  Oh, my God.  I can't do it.  I'm sorry.  In a galaxy like the Milky Way, you have many stars that...  Why is it the most boring people talking about the most exciting things?  I know.  It's like fucking black hole space.  They make action movies out of this shit.  Get someone with a little fucking energy.  You're talking about black holes sucking up stars.  Wake the fuck up.  You watch any Star Trek movie, you're like, fuck! 
[01:24:30]  Yeah!  Out of Space is the shit!  And these guys...  NPR is fucking terrible.  The most overrated...  People like it because it really pushes their particular political views and ideologies  and sensibilities.  But it's shit.  People think they're going to be looked at as intelligent if they listen to it. 
[01:25:00]  The most overrated form of communication in history is NPR.  It's fucking boring and biased.  Yes.  Like me.  Would you climb Mount Everest if you knew you would survive?  But how do you know you're going to survive?  And that takes the thrill out of it, doesn't it?  It's like a board game we're doing right now.  All right?  You don't know...  I don't know how you know you're going to survive, but let's just say you know you're  going to survive.  If I knew I was going to survive, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  I would do it fucking naked if I knew I was going to survive. 
[01:25:30]  No, you'd die if you were naked, though.  No, because then you're going to die if you don't have the proper clothing or something  goes wrong.  Good point.  So there's no way to do it with a complete guarantee.  Would you climb Mount Everest if you had a 10% chance of dying?  See, that's the question.  All right.  10% chance.  Now, you got the opportunity to be on the summit, which is something pretty amazing from what  I hear.  Not so amazing anymore.  No?  People are doing it right now. 
[01:26:00]  Right now?  We're doing a radio show.  Some guy is up there like, holy shit, look at the view.  Yeah.  Is there a guy up there right now, Sam?  Sam, is there a guy on Mount Everest right now?  Yeah.  Sam's head will explode.  No, he's up there.  I just saw the article.  No, but you can do it.  We can do the math.  Bill is Bill Tetley.  That's right.  He's up there right now.  Bill Tetley.  We could do the math, though.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  We can figure this out.  How many guys summit every day?  Yeah.  And then we could do it.  I found the video on Huffington Post. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, shit.  It's seasonal, by the way.  No, it's not.  Yeah, it's CGI.  No, it's not.  No, it's real.  No, that's not the one I saw.  Why?  It's on Huffington Post.  It's like everybody said.  It's NASA's CGI version of what a black hole sucking a sun in would look like.  No, this.  Huh?  Spaceship cameras sucking a sun in.  Looks like little legs kicking.  I want to fucking over-under on how many times Sam's going to attempt to show us this fucking video and film miserably. 
[01:27:00]  That might have been the one I saw.  Oh, that's...  It might have been.  I thought it was real.  No, dude.  I'm dying.  Are you listening to the NPR thing again?  Yes.  Yes.  Let's hear this motherfucker.  The Big Dipper has a shiny new sequin on its handle.  It's a supernova.  That's what I call my cock, the Big Dipper.  This weekend's a rare opportunity for amateurs to see...  It's the big part we have an issue with.  ...we'll be able to catch a glimpse of the fireball from their backyard as it reaches peak brightness over the next... 
[01:27:30]  There's going to be a fireball...  ...over our backyard?  ...that you can see from your backyard, and this guy's talking like...  Yeah.  Like, we're a fireball, but you're going to see...  I don't believe it.  How many guys summit Mount Everest every day, Sam?  Every day.  14.  Our goal is to have your...  He's just yelling numbers out now to sound like...  No, I just saw it on Winky.  It's 14.  It's 14 a day.  There are days where nobody probably does...  Right, that's on average, 14.  Like Mackinac Peaches, Jerry!  So the average is 14. 
[01:28:00]  That's right.  So there's some days that there are more.  So let's go with the average.  14.  That means, well, one every less than two hours.  That's it?  That's like...  So we do about a four-hour radio show, so about two to two and a half people are going to  summit during this radio show alone.  So it's not that special anymore.  No, it's not.  It really isn't.  It's not.  It's a photo of the video that you're looking for.  Oh, God.  You're the worst.  All right.  That's an X-ray close-up of X-ray camera looking at the... 
[01:28:30]  All right.  How close do you think that camera got?  About a mile?  There it is.  Yeah, it could be more than that.  This is it.  It's located right...  Oh, my God.  It doesn't look like a black hole.  It's a bunch of people with a tablet sign.  That's right.  That's right.  By the way, my brother brought up something about the fucking internet.  He said, and I think we could all agree, 15-second ads.  We were in.  They had us.  Okay, I could do a 15-second ad.  I could live with that, right?  I could live with this.  He goes, when I see 30 seconds, it's not important enough to me. 
[01:29:00]  Now I'm out.  So why is the internet doing exactly what radio did?  Because they're dumb and greedy like radio is.  Because they're stupid.  Why don't you just tell all your advertisers, no, this is it.  We're only doing 15-second ads.  I'm all to piss off.  And my brother's right.  As soon as I see the 30-second, I'm like, I really start weighing.  Is it really worth sitting through 30 seconds?  I will sit almost every time through 15 seconds.  I'm actually on my Twitter having 45-minute ads before each tweet that people must watch  and respond to.  It's how I'm going to make millions.  And respond.  And make a book report. 
[01:29:30]  Take a survey.  They have to send in a book report to Jim Norton on Twitter.  Here's the video.  And then you can fucking see his latest tweet.  That's a video.  There it is.  It's just a bunch of pictures.  No, it's all videos.  Supernova will reach a peak brightness next Thursday, September 8th.  It's not a video.  Yeah, what they're doing.  NGC 3393.  They're just zooming into a still picture.  Why is there two different videos playing?  What are you doing?  Sam.  I don't know what I'm doing.  And even the Hubble Space Telescope.  I don't know what I'm doing.  There's too many different things playing. 
[01:30:00]  Sam goes, I don't know what I'm doing.  He's playing NPR and the NASA footage.  What the fuck are you doing?  I thought that's what you wanted.  No.  I don't want to.  Oh, no.  It didn't happen.  Oh, no.  I urge you to stay.  I'm going to make you cry.  I'm going to stay.  I'm going to stay.  Oh, no.  And then Rick Roll.  Wow.  NPR got me.  I don't know.  NPR Rick Rolled you.  Those NPR guys.  Yeah.  They do have a sense of humor with that. 
[01:30:30]  They're characters.  Do you want to know why?  You can only be on the summit for a few minutes.  Why?  21 hours.  I'm going to see you're that dumb Sherpa that didn't have lungs or something.  And the weather up there is going to be bright, sunny skies, but a bit cold.  Are the skies darker if you're on the summit?  Yes.  You will see a bluer sky, much darker blue, because the atmosphere is thinner, because  you don't have as much atmosphere to look through.  Wow.  That would be creepy.  Yeah.  It looks like blue.  You know when you're in a jetliner and you kind of look up and it's a darker blue? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  That's how it looks up there.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Burton.  Yes?  Yes.  Hi.  Hey.  Okay.  Your turn.  Speak.  Hey.  So the reason why you can't stay for just a few minutes on Everest is because you're  in what's called the death zone, right?  There's a certain altitude where no matter how much oxygen you get, even from like bottled  oxygen, which is what they carry up there, your body is metabolizing on the side.  It's eating itself like every second.  So you can only say a certain amount of time to the time. 
[01:31:30]  You want to know how long you can stay?  That dumb Sherpa had like something not normal.  How long could the regular guy from?  The regular guy from, let's say, I don't know.  Iowa.  Iowa.  Perfect.  Yeah.  It's not necessarily how much you can stay on the top, but you've got to factor in the  time it takes to get down because you're still in the death zone.  You're just saying what we said differently.  You know that.  But we're just talking.  We want new knowledge.  Yeah.  Average guy, how long could he stay on the summit?  That's all I want to know.  I understand the air is thinner and you can't get enough oxygen and it starts eating your 
[01:32:00]  body.  I know all that.  Sam's got it.  Sam?  That's all the stuff.  21 hours.  No.  That was the Sherpa.  Oh my God.  Oh.  How?  What's the average stay?  They misspelled that.  Of everyone that's been up there.  It's not a Sherpa.  It was Chippa.  They spelled it wrong.  No, it wasn't Chippa.  No.  No.  Not average long stay Everest.  Average summit.  Right.  Average stay.  Well, all of it. 
[01:32:30]  And then you got these.  Oh, summits.  Summits, summits.  Then you got these assholes that are clogging up the fucking trail and you know you're running  out of time to get up there and back down in time before you fucking die.  They have to turn around sometimes.  Yes.  Which is, you know, all that money wasted.  Maybe, uh.  Oh my God.  Sam?  The answer is.  Sam?  I'm 14 minutes.  That's the average?  That's right.  What did I say?  How do you know?  The last website I checked.  Oh God.  Are you making that up? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Go to one guy.  Oh cool.  Roland was right.  He is just getting here.  Oh yeah.  Maybe he's coming right after Triple H.  At 10.  What happened?  Yeah, he's coming at 10.  What happened?  Triple H doesn't want to do our show anymore?  No, he's doing Fox.  That's too bad.  He's very busy.  Very busy man.  He's running WWE for God's sake.  Very busy man.  Do you have the answer, Sam?  No.  I made the 14 minutes up.  Fuck.  You made the 14 minutes up.  I know you did.  You know what we're going to do, Ant?  We're going to sit here until we find the answer.  If you don't find the average, the average stay on the summit of Mount Everest. 
[01:33:30]  They have to have it in the brochure.  Like just stay up here for seven minutes.  Where's the brochure for climbing Mount Everest?  We know about that guy.  21 hours.  We know about 21 hour guy.  If I hear it again, I'm throwing that fucking computer.  Let's see.  Should I go to Mount Everest information?  Yeah.  Oh my God, yeah.  Mount Everest information. 
[01:34:00]  Your call, please.  Why is it called Everest?  Is it windy?  Is the air thin?  How does your body get used to the altitude?  How high are the camps?  Keep going.  They got all the answers except the one we need.  Who's first to climb?  The first.  Blah, blah, blah.  We don't want first.  No.  Why do they give us first?  There's nothing on that site.  You are terrible.  I cannot get over how long this is taking.  In 2011, almost 2012, on the internet, you can't find out what the average stay. 
[01:34:30]  Right here, right here.  It's the fucking first day I Google.  21 hours.  No.  No.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  He's so bad.  This guy's saying, look up Beck Weathers.  Who the fuck's Beck Weathers?  Beck Weathers.  Sounds like a weatherman for him.  He's the star of a novel I'm writing called the Beck Weathers Weather Experiment.  It does sound like a name that Jimmy would come up with. 
[01:35:00]  Beck Weathers.  He just changes the clouds and stuff.  Beck Weathers.  Is Sam using a 9800 baud modem?  We got the answer from Tom in White Plains.  Tom.  All right.  Finally.  Is Tom alive?  Hi.  What's going on?  So, as you know, there's probably four camps.  Depends which side of the mountain you're climbing up on.  Yeah.  But if you were to be dropped from sea level and drop on the top of the mountain, they say  you would be dead within two to three minutes without that limitation.  Do we ask that?  No.  We just want the regular Joe that's climbing because he fucking is a rich motherfucker 
[01:35:30]  who wants to prove something to himself.  How long can that asshole stay up there?  It says here, Babu Sharipa.  Sherpa.  Babu Sharipa was in The Sopranos.  He was killed on the mountaintop buying trains.  He was at the top of the summit for 21 minutes.  No, we did that.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:00]  The average stay, and it can vary, is about approximately 17 minutes, although shorter  is normally the length of time.  So, 14.  And you are making that up.  Yes.  I knew it.  We need an answer.  God damn it.  We're stuck.  Ask Jeeves is coming in.  Can we ask Jeeves?  Okay, let me ask Jeeves.  Oh, ask Jeeves.  Thanks, Beggs from Pittsburgh there.  Thanks, Beggs.  Boy, did Google just crush hanging with Jeeves.  Because Jeeves would never really know how to interpret a question.  No. 
[01:36:30]  Jeeves is an idiot.  Yeah.  What's the average summit time in Mount Everest?  Mount Everest is in, all right.  Jeeves is a cunt.  We can't just get a fucking answer to this.  Yeah.  Does anyone know anyone that has climbed Mount Everest?  I know two people that have done it.  You can hold it together.  Yes.  I stared right into those evil eyes of yours.  There's a guy named Babu.  Yeah, we know about Babu.  He was a Stern fan on the top of whatever.  Babu, Babu.  Oh, Babu. 
[01:37:00]  One in 25 people that attempt to climb die.  So it's one in 25.  Yeah.  One in 25 die.  That's crazy.  Would you take those odds in?  Nah, that's a little nutty.  One in 25?  Let me think.  Fuck that.  Depending on how many go.  One out of every 25.  Is 24 guys ahead of you?  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Could be 50 people make and then two people die right away.  That's right.  So, you know.  What if, yeah, what if that, yeah, they take your death away from you? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's two in the first group.  So that means your group's safe.  Yes.  Jeeves doesn't have any fucking clue what the answer is.  Jeeves is a twat.  He don't know.  He doesn't know.  What did he say?  What did he ask Jeeves?  Should we tell Jeeves?  Because Jeeves knows nothing.  Go to Wikipedia.  He did a top 100 Rutherford Hospital.  He doesn't.  Jeeves is a fucking cunt.  I hate Jeeves.  I hope whoever fucking has that website is suffering right now. 
[01:38:00]  Jeeves is a bag of shit.  You asked him and he didn't give you shit, did he?  No, he's worthless.  So, we have no answer.  No, not at the moment.  And nothing now but frustration.  Yeah.  And so many people are sending me the black hole video.  I'm not clicking on any of these links.  Oh, believe me.  There is nothing but danger.  I'm not falling for it.  There is no black hole video.  There is.  I saw it.  Well, except the NPR thing.  We could play that again if I want.  Yeah, can we hear that?  Yeah.  That was kind of cool.  Check it out.  This guy's excited about nothing. 
[01:38:30]  Hmm.  I knew what I was going to hear today.  By the way, the first thing that comes up is Babu spent 21 hours.  That's what I didn't tell you.  Because I'm looking now.  Now I'm fucking looking.  That's what we should be.  And I'm pissed.  The audience is saying Babu to this bitch.  Babu.  Someone's saying on Wiki, less than a half an hour.  That's Tim Gennetti.  It's 14 minutes.  You don't know that.  That is less than a half hour.  14 might be.  And how much.  All right.  I got a new Mount Everest question, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the answer to this one? 
[01:39:00]  I could very well have the answer here.  It's less than 20 minutes, right?  14.  Let me get the.  You have to average shit.  Let me get the answer.  Okay.  It says here that Babu Sherper, who was at the summit for 21.5 hours, holds the record  for the most time spent on Everest.  Don't know if you knew that.  But then we do have something else.  However, people typically spend about an hour on top on average. 
[01:39:30]  There we go.  It's not the average.  Thank you.  It's just about what people spend.  No, it said it.  That's about as accurate as my 14 minutes.  By the way, when I put in the search, average time spent on Everest summit.  Yeah.  It was the one, two, three, four, five, six, one down.  I don't think it's an hour.  I don't think it's an hour either.  But if you're reading it, it's got to be true.  I bet most do way less than an hour.  Here's the other question. 
[01:40:00]  Around 14 minutes.  Average.  So there's probably some people that do like three hours.  How much room is there on the actual summit?  Or do you get cheated and you're like kind of a little below because there's some.  Because somebody else is on top top.  There's some asshole on the tippy top.  Yeah.  Does anyone know how much room is up there?  You have like king of the hill and run and shit him.  And watch him slide down to his death.  It's actually three inches.  It's a very small summit.  Everyone just goes up there and stands on their tippy toes.  This sucks.  Excuse me, pardon me.  Excuse me, pardon me.  You're getting back. 
[01:40:30]  Excuse me, pardon me.  Jet stream.  Excuse me, pardon me.  Pardon me.  Jet stream.  It's approximately 230 miles smiley face.  I got that off wiki answers.  Yeah, I don't think that's true.  230 miles of.  Wow, that's a lot of room.  With a smiley face.  You could actually play football up there.  People have done that.  They actually want to build a stadium.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's pretty high.  Yeah, you're going to climb up with a badge.  You know how fucking annoying games would be?  Babu would be happy.  Babu would be up there for the whole game.  He could sit through rain delays or anything. 
[01:41:00]  21 hours, I hear.  He'd be up there for a while.  I don't know.  21 and a half.  21 and a half.  Now, with the 21 hours, I'm going to challenge the Babu.  Babu's a queer.  I am going to bet, anyone who wants to take the bet, that the 21 hours wasn't at one sitting.  What?  No, because he did 10 climbs total.  I think it's a total time thing.  Whoa, wait a minute.  That changes everything.  No, no, no.  I'm not buying that for a second.  I'm buying that.  I don't think so.  I say he sat up there for 21 hours.  Nah. 
[01:41:30]  He set the record.  No.  Total time up at the summer.  Now you're talking.  Now he's a pussy.  Yeah.  I thought he was the man.  Would you like him more if he was Babu's?  Because he's Boo's?  Yes, because he's Boo's.  Yeah.  Babu's.  The longest guy on top of Everest was indeed Babu's.  Yeah.  How long, though, in one sitting?  21 and a half.  Yes, of course it is.  Holy shit.  Now we're kidding.  Oh, my God.  Do I just want to smack my head against the wall? 
[01:42:00]  But Zach in Jersey writes that a guy meditated on Everest this past climbing season for 27 hours,  and there is a link.  Oh, okay.  So.  Oh, there's a link.  Let me try to look it up.  I'm bad at this.  No, I'm sweating.  Go to Instant Feedback and just fucking click the link.  That's what Danny would do.  Instant what?  I don't have Instant Feedback.  Oh, I know.  I barely look at it these days.  Sorry to the people that are still using that.  I don't even have the login stuff for Instant Feedback.  I'm hearing in spring of 99, Babu spent over 21 hours on the summit of Everest. 
[01:42:30]  In spring 2000, he set the speed record for climbing Everest on the south side.  Probably one and a half hours.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know.  I said over 21 hours.  Yeah.  Babu's a good boy.  Oh, he's a man.  Yeah.  He's a Sherpa.  A little Babu in his crib.  Babu stinks.  I hate Babu.  He's got to be like the most famous guy over there.  Oh, yeah.  He's the Sherpa that everybody talks about.  That's him.  That's him.  That's Babu.  The asshole who couldn't remember how to get down.  I think it's a fucking weakness.  What do you got, Sam? 
[01:43:00]  Do you got the other thing?  I got the video.  Oh, you got the video of the black hole?  There it is.  There's the black hole video.  Nice.  There it is.  I've seen this before.  Wait a minute.  Wait, we did this already?  I want the guy that meditated.  No, you guys said Huffington Post.  Yeah, that's not the video I saw.  But this isn't a real video.  Yes, it is.  A bunch of bunks, Sam.  CGI, and it's badly done.  It looks very computer-y.  Could you do the meditating guy?  Yes.  You want the link? 
[01:43:30]  All right, ready?  I don't think.  I think it's a...  Here's the link.  Ready?  Facsimile.  HTTP dot dot...  Dot dot or colon?  Colon.  Oh, okay.  Backslash backslash jotzoom.com  backslash man dash mediites dash on dash Everest dash summit dash four dash 27 hours backslash  one, two, four, seven, backslash.  You got that?  Right.  Google meditate.  What? 
[01:44:00]  I'm just going to Google.  No, it's mediite.  Medi...  Medi...  It's...  Yeah, meditate.  See, another thing is Sam has no clue how to search for things very well.  He puts in bad keywords.  Got the link.  Whatever.  He got the jot zoom.  Jot zoom in the house.  And his spelling is atrocious.  He is an absolute dumbbell.  Yes.  A zero on the internet.  Yes, and authors.  A little strange.  Why don't you talk to jot zoom about any problems you have with me?  Because I got it up in a flash.  Fair enough.  Is there a video of the guy meditating?  No, but you were trying to get jet stream.  Oh. 
[01:44:30]  No, there's not.  It's an article.  Do we play his meditating video in real time?  It would be 27 hours.  27 hours.  In real time.  I think that takes us to the weekend.  What?  Are you complaining?  Not at all.  Okay.  I actually got some...  Where's the meditating guy?  That guy with the short sleeves?  Holy shit.  No, that's a dead body.  Oh.  Oh.  I got an NPR thing if you want to listen to it.  Yeah, let's hear this.  Okay.  What is this now? 
[01:45:00]  It's all about the...  The Big Dipper.  Yep.  Has a shiny new sequin on its handle.  It's a supernova.  On its handle?  It's a blast hurrah of a star.  This weekend's a rare opportunity for amateurs to see a supernova from Earth.  People all over the country will be able to catch a red tube and go to the...  That's a nova with a cape.  I like amateurs, too.  Peter Nugent.  Wait, really?  Right?  You know, you could just pretend that you saw...  You could just pretend that you're watching the video right now.  It's the radio.  Thanks for being here.  Why can't this guy get some energy up for a rare opportunity for amateurs to see some 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Especially talking about an event like a supernova, which is a lot of energy.  Right.  It's not charismatic.  The supernova is a star's way of going,  Ah, cha-cha!  It's super.  It says here,  Bakara Kumar Rai is the one who set the record and stayed up there for 27 hours.  I don't believe that bullshit.  I bet he lied.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Who's going to...  And who's going to check his...  He could climb down and say, yeah, I was up there. 
[01:46:00]  I was up there.  He's up there for fucking 50 hours.  Go fuck your mother.  He could be at the low part.  Yeah.  And he's going to know.  And his friend's like, you were at the bar with me.  He could be at home.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know what me?  I climbed Everest there.  I was up there for 52 hours.  You were watching Sherpa TV.  Put me in there.  By the way, whoever gets Babu Sherpa, I will follow on Twitter.  You got to follow Babu Sherpa.  Yes.  Tweet about being on top of Matt Everett.  Exactly.  But that's all you can tweet about.  It's cold up here.  As soon as you change your Twitter into something else, I'm gone. 
[01:46:30]  Wish they would finish that stadium.  If you're tweeting about just hanging out on the summit, I'm there.  Well, was thinking about coming down, but where am I going to go?  I got nothing going on.  He's just up there all the time.  Made another snowman.  Hard to find carrots and coal.  He's trying to get a reality show of the real Sherpas of Everest.  All the camera crews die before they make it up there.  They have to shoot from the base camp at 13,000 feet.  No one can see them.  That little black dot up there is him cheating on his wife with another black dot, which is 
[01:47:00]  a cadaver.  He's having sex with Mallory's asshole with black dots on it.  That's why the asshole was all torn.  Exactly.  There were some lonely guys climbing that fucking mountain, huh?  It's who Sherpa's kicking the guy in the ass called a bum.  We should have made the joke an hour ago, because that's the only part that was not intact.  Instead of getting in the ass area.  Someone tore that ass up.  Boy, did they.  Maybe it was Babu.  Well, Babu's got a post here.  He retweeted, I guess.  It says, at Babu Sherpa. 
[01:47:30]  And it's hashtag Burr.  Oh, nice.  I like that.  It's just Burr.  He's very cold up there, I think.  What do we got?  And it says this guy who, first of all, we all know JotZoom is bullshit, because it says  the previous record was 22 hours, which is nonsense.  We all know.  That's bullshit.  It's 21 and a half.  And it says that this guy, who was meditating for 27 hours, used oxygen for 11 and a half  hours of his stay.  Oh.  That's cheating.  Yeah.  We want the guy without the oxygen.  Yeah.  What's the guy without the oxygen record? 
[01:48:00]  Babu Sherpa, 21 and a half hours.  Holy shit, he's a fucking hero.  Hall of Fame.  Is there a Mount Everest Hall of Fame, you think?  Yeah.  It's got to be.  Yeah?  What's in there?  It's all over the mountain.  Babu's boots are in there.  All right, should we break, I guess?  Yeah.  No.  That Babu's boots joke really ruined the flow.  We never saw the black hole fucking video.  Because you're asking for things that don't exist.  It's true.  I mean, that's what happens.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, somebody said it existed, and we got a bunch of links about it. 
[01:48:30]  But none of them were accurate.  I clicked on all of them.  You're too busy listening to fucking Never Gonna Give You Up.  It's a good song, man.  Never gonna let you know.  Never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down.  Never gonna run around and desert you.  Never gonna make you down.  White guy, who knew, right?  Who knew, right?  Who knew, right?  Who knew, right?  Everybody in the song makes sense.  I'm gonna tell you why.  Shuggy, Ducky, Quack, Quack.  Speaking of Shuggy, Ducky, Quack, Quack.  Shuggy, Quack, Quack, Quack.  This is quick.  We can do this going into break, I guess.  Booker T's doing Shuggy, Ducky, Quack, Quack. 
[01:49:00]  Booker T's...  On the WWE, huh?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  Shuggy, Ducky, Quack, Quack.  I don't think anyone was doing Shuggy, Ducky, Quack, Quack until we brought it back into  everyone's fucking brains, Sam.  What's going on?  Are they biting off us over there?  They could be, but Booker T has an odd...  Booker T?  Booker.  Booker.  Booker T has a very odd style of color commentary and tries to create catchphrases and things  like that, and this is his big catchphrase.  Sam, can you play my favorite Booker T clip? 
[01:49:30]  You betcha.  You know it, right, Ed?  Which one is that?  Booker T clip?  Favorite one?  Oh, you'll love it.  Cutting a promo on Hulk Hogan and gets all mad at himself?  Oh, God, you can't...  That's right over there.  Yes, here it is.  Oh, this one.  Right, right.  We take what we want, and after we take that frugger and the child, we want the gold sucker.  Hulk Hogan, we're coming for you, nigga.  I should plan out for the record, Stevie Ray, look at this. 
[01:50:00]  Take a look.  He gets so mad that he said the N-word.  He dropped the N-ster.  He dropped the N-ster.  Is that on live TV?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Have you ever heard the Vince McMahon clip when he drops it?  No.  No.  You haven't?  No, I don't think so.  Have we played it?  I don't remember.  What's up, boss?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Yeah.  What's good in the hood?  Just holding it down, trying to take care of business.  Keep it up, I'm a nigga.  Yeah, we've played this. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Vince is an asshole.  Tell me.  He didn't just say that.  Fucking Vince.  What year was that, by the way?  That was like maybe a year before they went TVPG.  That was like not long ago.  Yeah, that was when Vince was out of his fucking mind, though.  And everything was funny about wrestling.  Well, just how he delivered the line and walked away all proudly. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, like, yeah, I said that.  I'm part of the hood.  You're like strutted away right by Booker T.  Well, here's Booker T doing shucky, ducky, quack, quack.  Why is he using this?  It's his catchphrase.  Yeah.  He does it when the divas come out to symbolize sexual stimulation.  Tonight, the gorgeous divas champion looks to bounce back.  Josh, can I say this?  Shucky, ducky.  Quack.  Quack.  Usually, you're a little more intense than that.  Yeah, he doesn't even...  Yeah, he's not delivering it properly. 
[01:51:30]  Well, he likes to...  Shucky, ducky.  Quack, quack.  First of all, he gives no credit to the fact that any comedian has ever used it.  And second, he mixes it up.  Oh, shucky, ducky.  Quack, quack, quack.  I don't think it's going to catch on.  He's ripping him off.  He's trying.  It's fucked up.  Trying to get a t-shirt out and everything.  Damn, that ain't happening.  Sammy Sweetheart will be here in about a half hour from the Jersey Shore.  Oh.  And Emmett Smith. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  The great running back.  I have to...  I forgot to mention something.  It's important, though.  Oh, shit.  Yeah?  It involves Tampa, Florida.  Oh, my appearance there.  You're going to Tampa?  September 29th through October 1st at the Improv.  I'll be seeing Cowhead.  Nice.  Yeah.  I think Eric knows that club.  Probably, because it's not far from where he grew up.  That's right.  Eric, did you grow up close to the club down there?  Tampa Improv?  Yeah, Tampa Improv.  From East Islip, Long Island?  No.  Why do you keep saying East Islip, Long Island?  He's doing a character.  Is that what it is?  East Islip. 
[01:52:30]  First of all, I lived in East Islip.  Never fucking saw you.  Back in the 20s.  You're from Florida.  Where in East Islip did you live?  Technically, it was called Great River.  He's Google mapping right now.  Great River, exactly.  Great River.  We all have Google Maps on our phones.  So it's either East Islip or it's not.  It's all part of East Islip.  Where do you live in Florida?  In West Palm Beach.  What school did you go to?  Tim, did you go to Timber Point Elementary?  Timber Point?  No.  I went to Timber Point. 
[01:53:00]  He just said that because you said it first.  Wait, how the fuck did all this time go by?  Wait, you guys went to the same school?  I went to Timber Point.  I went to the junior high and East Islip High School.  That's right.  Like Timber Point Lane is right there.  We didn't go to East Islip High School.  Timber Point did not.  And Country Village Lane.  This is over there.  I went to that school.  That's where I got in a fight with Boomer.  Whoa.  Boomer Esiason went to fucking Timber Point Elementary School.  And I punched him in the head and I broke my arm.  You sure did.  Eric went to Tampa Bay High. 
[01:53:30]  How did Eric go to fucking...  We went to the same fucking elementary school.  He's bullshitting.  He just heard you say it on the air before.  Is that what it was?  Tampa Bay High.  Tampa Bay High is where Eric went to high school.  Tampa Bay.  He was on the junior photographer's club.  He would take pictures around Tampa and get them published in local papers.  There's really boring photos.  Hey, which Babu Sherpa do you want to follow?  Because one guy is spelling it B-A-B-O-O.  That's fucked up. 
[01:54:00]  That's not him.  Okay.  It's me, Babu.  I climbed Everest and stayed up there for many hours.  No, but you know why?  Because he started getting past tense.  Babu is tweeting from the top of Mount Everest.  Yeah, we want Babu to be up there already hanging out.  And it's B-A-B-U.  Duh.  Is it B-A-B-U?  Is there any B-A-B-U guys yet?  B-A-B-U and he's tweeting from the top of Mount Everest.  I hate you.  Anyone?  Yeah?  Nothing?  Okay.  That was really brilliant.  Fuck. 
[01:54:30]  A-B-U, we hate you?  Jimmy Cheneau.  I didn't even know what you mean.  It's the famous bra bombing.  I think it was A-B-U, we hate you.  Oh my God.  It's got no wonder I blocked that shit out.  B-A-B-U, we hate you.  Yuck.  Take another bra, Bob.  Yeah, we're flying around in a dirigible.  Oh God.  Oh the hackadness.  We've done this way too long.  Yeah.  That was not your best moment. 
[01:55:00]  W-A-B-U, we hate you.  Yeah, that's what it was.  So that's almost Babu.  That's Wabu.  Yeah.  Babu Sherpa.  Babu Sherpa.  It's got to be Babu Sherpa.  Is Babu Sherpa fucking tweeting?  He should be.  He should be.  From the top of Mount Everest, giving us updates.  Yes.  I have Wi-Fi.  If you're not funny, you better fucking give the name to somebody who is.  Yeah, don't waste it.  Well then there's another one.  Babu, B-A-B-U, good.  And then it's C-H-I-R-I.  What's that? 
[01:55:30]  No.  Sherpa.  I guess that's his full name, maybe?  It's S-H.  And he just tweeted, ever stick your dick in the snow.  That would be something that Babu Sherpa would tweet.  Yeah, because he's fucking crazy.  I mean, She-Ra is his middle name.  Oh, it is.  I mean, it is.  Which one are we following?  I still think it remains to be She-Ra.  Babu Sherpa.  Just Babu Sherpa?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't want the cheery middle name.  All right, look it up.  No, no, no.  Do we have a Babu Sherpa yet?  Babu Sherpa.  B-A-B-U-S-H-E-R-P-A.  It's got to be Babu Sherpa at this point, right? 
[01:56:00]  I have to take that.  Yeah.  Babu Sherpa.  He hasn't even tweeted.  What's he doing up there?  Oh, come on.  He's got 21 hours.  He's probably dead.  Who is he following?  Let's see.  One person.  One Sherpa.  One Sherpa.  One Sherpa.  His real name is Babu Sherpa.  Let's check.  Wait, it's getting confusing.  One Sherpa is Babu Sherpa?  And one Sherpa says, I am make good friend.  I am make good friend, but no.  That's actually Bobo.  Well, we want Babu Sherpa.  Wow, now there's 20 people following Babu Sherpa. 
[01:56:30]  Eight followers.  No, man.  Look, it went way up.  Seven now.  Someone bailed out.  Why is he tweeting like a maniac?  Why the hell is Babu Sherpa not tweeting like a maniac?  Yeah, why is he waiting so long?  Unless...  This is going to be a dumb bit by Babu Sherpa.  Babu Sherpa in 1965.  I am in trekking and mountaineering business.  No, he's not.  I think this might be the actual...  Look at the picture.  Wait, holy shit.  Is that the actual guy? 
[01:57:00]  The actual guy didn't even get Babu Sherpa.  That has to be him.  Come on, he's got 21 followers.  He spent more time up there than anybody.  Wait, is that the guy?  Fucking, let's get Babu Sherpa on the phone tonight.  I better check and make sure Babu Sherpa's not dead.  Yeah, let's look.  Let's see.  Is he verified?  He's not verified.  Mark, sad news for you all.  My lovely son, Mifam, eight years, died on 13th May.  I wish him, pray for his soul and peace and ever.  Babu Sherpa.  I bet you that's really him.  Holy shit, we found the real Babu Sherpa.  Every summit push would be from 1031 May to spring 2011. 
[01:57:30]  That's the real guy and he's only got 21 followers?  Yeah, who's a fucking...  He's a buzzkill.  My fucking son died.  I'm praying for his soul.  Boo!  There's something...  How many hours did he spend up there?  21 and a half.  And he's got 21 followers.  Holy shit.  One for every hour.  Wow.  Fucked up shit right there.  Babu Sherpa.  Look at that.  B-A-B-U-S-H-E-R-P-A, 1965.  This is really him, I think.  Yeah.  So we should all Twitter him. 
[01:58:00]  Just don't ask him chip questions because that would probably make him not want to contact us.  We really want him on the show.  What did you do on Mount...  Why don't you capitalize Mount Everest, have some respect.  Ask him if he...  Ask him if he pooed up there.  Please.  Did he make duties?  Yeah.  Where did you make duties?  Jesus.  God.  Tweet, and he's sending.  Oh, but Babu Sherpa's going to wonder why the fuck... 
[01:58:30]  Well, we want to know where he made duties, man.  It's fair.  I said...  I kept it classy.  I said, where did you go number two?  Oh.  This guy fucking was the guy.  And he couldn't even get Babu Sherpa.  He had to go Babu Sherpa in 1965.  I'm following him.  And he's in Nepal.  All right.  How many followers does he have?  22 now.  22 now with the amazing fucking...  I'm sure a few others jumped on.  33.  He's probably like, oh my God, that tweet about the fucking...  My son dying was a fucking hit.  He's trying to find other dead relatives.  My grandmother found a lump on her cunt.  Send... 
[01:59:00]  Oh my God.  Another 50 followers.  He just starts offing people with his Sherpa knife.  Exactly.  Those curly Q Sherpa knives.  Oh, that's funny.  Hilarious.  I'm surprised, though.  How many Babu Sherpas on there?  Imposter.  A bunch of them.  Yeah.  Good family.  Now we got the guy with the Babu underscore Sherpa.  That's not good enough.  No, underscore can pull away. 
[01:59:30]  Especially since we know the real guy.  I don't follow any underscore Twitter accounts, by the way.  Little known fact.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I just sent out a ship.  I'm going to check your work.  The underscore really bothers me.  I'm sending out a tweet to the Twitterverse encouraging everybody to follow him.  To follow him.  Sure, sure.  You only have three more followers than he does.  He'll lose his mind.  All right.  How many followers is he up to now?  68.  Nice.  68 because of the sad news that his son died. 
[02:00:00]  What did he die of?  Let's see the ad.  Probably tried to take him up the mountain with him.  Let's see the ad.  Eight years old.  Or the kid was like, how come you didn't spend 22 hours and you beat him to death?  Cut it, pops?  Yeah, yeah.  He beat him with a fucking mountain shoe.  Somebody just tweeted him, can you see my house from there?  Did you shit on the tippity top of the big mountain?  That's Kevin.  Kevin from Connecticut.  The big mountain.  Kevin from Conn.  C-O-N-N.  Is that all the ad mentions? 
[02:00:30]  So far.  All right.  How many followers does he have now, Sam?  Let me go back.  I'm going to guess 89.  68 is now 100.  We're at our end.  Wow.  All right.  People are following him like crazy.  Good for him.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Good for him.  He went from fucking, how many did he start with?  21, and now he's going to be like, what happened?  He's trying to just tweet with his little frozen fingers, but they're no good.  When was his last tweet?  19th of May.  Holy shit. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  So he doesn't really check his Twitter that much.  Would you have only had 21 followers?  No.  Although his first...  He only had 10,000 for that.  What happened?  Your mic just goes off.  I know.  I saw it.  No one touched it.  That happened yesterday, too.  He probably had like 123,000, but then he fucking tweeted that depressing news and everyone  left.  They all bailed on him.  We come to you for laughs, pal.  His first one was, hi, what's up?  And that was April 11th.  He spent the months of April and May going...  Guys, we're crazy.  And then he wrote, hi, I want right you.  I'm getting really bad news.  What's wrong?  Greg in North Carolina.  Greg! 
[02:01:30]  Hey, I hope...  The real Babu Sherpa died in 2001 trying to make his 11th call.  No way.  Oh, shit.  Trying to make what?  Trying to make his 11th climb to the top.  Everyone's saying Babu Sherpa died in 2001.  No joke.  It's coming in.  Oh, no.  And we could have looked that up.  But how is he, Babu Sherpa?  This is probably another...  Maybe Babu Sherpa is like saying something else.  Maybe that's not a common name.  Like Bob Smith here?  Bob Smith, yeah.  You know what, dude? 
[02:02:00]  John Doe.  I'm Babu Sherpa, dude.  I climb.  You know what, dude?  Like Robert Kelly, as common as a Robert Kelly man.  You got your summit, you dead eight-year-old, you Twitter.  You know, you climb and it's cold.  Boom.  You make some coffee.  You know what, dude?  You got a cup of coffee.  We're up here.  You got your iPhone, your app.  Look at my app, dude.  Look at my app.  I don't care.  Dead or alive, he's up to 147 followers.  Babu Sherpa, 1965. 
[02:02:30]  Bad year to die, 2001?  Yeah, I know.  He really kind of lost all the publicity, didn't he?  Good Morning America was ready to go with their Babu Sherpa piece.  Our special on Babu Sherpa.  Be able to catch that on September 12th.  Coming up, we did a lot of work.  This man, it's needed that we recognize him.  That one went in the old shit can.  Yeah, this is a bummer.  Babu Sherpa is no longer with us. 
[02:03:00]  Let's see if there's any more action.  Maybe he should have saved some of that oxygen for the end of his life.  Exactly.  Just race it all up in the fucking summit.  Be funny if he was shot trying to rob a liquor store.  How did he die?  I don't know.  I hope his thumb just asked him, couldn't you make it 22 hours?  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  Why stop at 21 and a half after 30 minutes?  What a bum.  Does your iPhone work there?  That's a good question.  Well, it depends.  AT&T or Verizon.  Well, this guy is not helping out.  I bet Verizon gets all bars. 
[02:03:30]  Five bars up there.  He died of vertigo.  Vertigo.  What did he die of?  He was a dizzy man.  What did he die of?  Yeah, what did he die of?  That's a good question.  Is that Babu Sherpa right there?  Is that his body?  No way.  That looks like that thing from that movie.  Skullhead.  Yeah.  Skullhead.  It's very creepy looking.  I hope he died.  He was planning another bid for the summit on April 29th while near camp, and apparently  taking photographs, he miscalculated his step and fell into a crevice and died. 
[02:04:00]  Whoa, so he died on the mountain?  Yeah.  Nobody died on base camp without taking pictures of a fucking tourist asshole.  What a dumb idiot.  That's how I should die on the mountain, not him.  He died doing what he loved.  Screaming.  Sherpa.  He was probably trying to take a picture of his cock when no one could see it, with  the mountain in the background, and make it look like his cock was bigger, and he  fell.  Forced perspective.  Yeah.  With Mount Everest and your cock.  You're trying to tell me a loose rock took out Babu Sherpa? 
[02:04:30]  Impossible.  Exactly.  No fucking way, man.  He's a rumor man.  He's hanging out with Hendrix.  Well, I see he's on Twitter still.  That's why he stayed up there for so long.  He was scared to climb down.  He was shit.  When you woke up this morning, did you think we were going to talk about Babu Sherpa for an  hour in?  I actually planned on it.  Yeah.  I thought so yesterday.  Sure.  How did we not get to that yesterday?  It's the magic of Google.  That's my strength on the computer.  Sure.  Google fired.  Let's take a break, because we've got Sammy Sweetheart and her legs going. 
[02:05:00]  Oh.  Is she going to be showing off her legs, or are they going to be covered up there, Sam?  I told the talent department, if she's not showing her legs, she can't come in.  And did she lose some of her chub?  Yes, she did.  Jeez.  Her chub is very apparent in this season of the Jersey Shore, Italy.  Well, I mean, I guess that's a question you ought to save more recently for the interview  when you talk to her.  Ask her if she's managed to get off any of the chub.  Yeah, a little too chub.  Let's get Babu Sherpa trending.  Why?  Yeah.  Because that's what people do now.  You've got to get a trending topic. 
[02:05:30]  Trending.  How many followers?  How about we get Sam can't fucking use the internet trending?  I got the Babu Sherpa conversation rocking and rolling.  Please.  Yeah.  You didn't even want me to talk about him.  212 followers.  He is a cranking.  He really is.  That's good.  Good for him.  Except he's dead because he slipped while he's taking pictures.  Slipped on a rocket dickhead.  Adult.  Sammy Sweetheart at 9 and a very boring Emmitt Smith interview at 930.  Oh, shit.  Great running back, but I can't imagine this is going to be exciting. 
[02:06:00]  Game on.  You think this is as good as The Catch?  Game on?  Yeah.  That was a good interview for The Catch.  You guys loved it.  I loved sitting there on fire.  That's one of my favorite things ever.  You know why?  Because we didn't have to do anything.  We just sat there on a couch and laughed.  No, I remember we were around the corner with microphones beating the shit out of Sam  and E-Rod.  It was great.  What were some of the questions we asked as not us?  I don't remember, but you made things very uncomfortable.  Yeah, we sure did.  So Emmitt Smith at 930.  That should be something that we'll all cherish. 
[02:06:30]  I benefited greatly from parents who put the interest of all their children above their  own.  I also had teachers, coaches, and teammates who cared enough to cheer my victories, console  me in defeat, and set me straight when I needed to hear the truth, even if I didn't like it.  Such friends are rare, and I am grateful for them.  I do all I can to be a good friend.  Most of us are born self-centered because we come into this world with limited awareness. 
[02:07:00]  As newborns and toddlers, and often even teenagers, we tend to think the universe revolves around  our needs.  End person.  Empathy, the ability to put ourselves in the shoes of other people comes with maturity.  Only after we've experienced the world beyond our backyards do we begin to understand how  much we all depend on each other. 
[02:07:30]  Just a little excerpt from Game On.  What happened?  Find your purpose, pursue your dream.  What happened?  Oh my god.  Let me see this thing.  By Emmitt Smith.  Wowie Kazowie.  You didn't just read that.  Oh, I certainly did.  I couldn't make that shit up.  Maybe he'll have some insight on this Babush Sherpa I keep hearing about.  That would be good.  Can't we just give him a football and watch him run up and down the long hallway?  That would make great radio. 
[02:08:00]  Just watch him rush through some interns.  Right, and every time he does one lap, he'll promote his book.  Yeah.  Oh, he was on Dance with the Stars.  That's right.  Oh, he was on that.  Didn't he win Dance with the Stars?  You bet he did.  He fucking tore that shit up.  Oh, damn.  Watch your language.  What does that mean?  Season three.  What does that mean if you went Dance with the Stars and you're a guy?  His partner has been on our show before.  Partner?  He has a partner?  I thought he was married.  No, his dancing partner.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She came in with Chris Jericho.  Yeah, she's pretty hot. 
[02:08:30]  Is he using his Just for Men on the cover?  He sure isn't.  No, he let...  No, he let...  Yeah, he's Just for Men.  He's got some medicine in.  Well, they got that Just for Men with the gray in it now.  To make you look like you have experience, you still have the energy of your youth.  You're not some kid, but you're not an old man.  Let's not go crazy.  Keith Hernandez.  Keith Hernandez.  You want to know what you'll learn if you read Game On?  Please help me.  You will learn how to turn your dreams into goals. 
[02:09:00]  Nice.  Pursue your dreams while...  My dreams are always very scary.  I don't want to fucking...  I don't want my dreams to come true.  Because they usually involve bad people chasing me.  And I can't run away from them.  And my guns never work in my dreams.  Fuck.  It's terrible.  Great point.  Frightening.  Dreams.  Yeah, you don't want them to come true.  No, they're scary.  There's monsters in them.  Anthony's absolutely right.  You're right.  Dreams are a scary thing.  And they should just be kept in the dream world.  Of course they are.  They're horrifying.  Also, pursue your dreams with unrelenting commitment.  What does that even mean?  Be courageous even when faced with your worst fears. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's when you have to be courageous, isn't it?  Seize and create opportunities that match up with your goals.  And, ready for this one?  Hold on, wait.  No, I am.  Go ahead.  And, much more.  Whoa!  How does he get it all in one book?  Can we not, right before he comes in?  You've got no idea what we just did.  Yeah, what do you think was going on?  We read an excerpt.  I just read an excerpt.  It was terrific.  From his book. 
[02:10:00]  Don't worry.  With some nice music behind him.  It was very poetic.  It was nice.  It was poetic.  By the way, Bobo Sherpa is now tweeting.  Bobo Sherpa.  Bobo Sherpa.  That's different.  It's cold up here.  Mr. Maloonigans is frozen, by the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Now, somebody said that Bobo was tweeting that he's pulling out of this whole thing with  the girls.  Who cares?  No, he's not pulling out of it.  Why is he so dramatic?  I was just wondering if he posted his cell phone number on his Twitter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trying to get some ladies.  Because I'm going to tell Bobo I don't even give a fuck. 
[02:10:30]  That is an attention whore.  I don't know what is.  I don't even give a fuck he's alive.  Stop tweeting me before I fucking block you.  He doesn't believe it when other people tell him that.  He thinks that he needs to hear it from you.  I don't care about Bobo.  You don't?  No.  Whether he lived or died?  Well, that's some weird karma shit.  I just don't care about him.  Fuck karma.  I hope he dies.  If karma meant anything, he never would have lived.  Oh, shit. 
[02:11:00]  I hope he dies in an hour.  What did his poor mom do to deserve that?  Exactly.  In that past life?  What did her vagina do?  Rob a fucking bank and kill eight pedestrians?  Anthony, would you like to hear a tweet from WABU, we hate you?  Who's now tweeting.  Christ, great.  Tweeting from the clear skies above Mount Everest.  Christ, I just dropped a bra bomb on Babu's dead body.  The hero of Nepal.  And we're just goofing on him here. 
[02:11:30]  No.  Not Uncle.  Uncle.  No.  No, it's Nepal.  I thought you were saying no, Paul.  Heard that one.  I bet you have.  Not Paul.  Not Paul.  Quiet.  Teach you a thing.  Should we break then and get ready for the Sammy Sweetheart?  Why don't we do that?  If she's not showing her legs, tell her to go home.  All right.  Sam, please.  It's all about the legs.  Exactly.  She's going to be a bore.  Yeah.  Why are you saying things about people that are coming in later? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I don't understand.  What happened?  You ran down the list of guests that were coming in today and said they were boring.  No, Emmitt Smith's going to be all right.  That's only a minute ago.  As long as he runs the ball up and down the hallway.  He may not be there.  But he's a nice man.  We want him to run up and down the hallway with a ball.  What we were suggesting was just give him a football and let him run around the hallway.  How great would that be?  We should see who on staff can block him.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  That's good.  Would he do that, do you think? 
[02:12:30]  He rocked you up for it.  I'm up for it.  Yeah.  I'll do it.  That's great.  That's all we need.  I'd love Emmitt to push me through a window.  Emmitt Smith to have a broken hip in our fucking hallway.  I'll destroy him.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, people are like, he's 50, dude.  He's going to run down the hallway.  What happened?  People are like, dude, he's 50.  He doesn't have anything to prove to anyone.  Running down the hallway with E-Rocks standing in front of him.  Let's not forget the softball game.  BAB versus the 1969 Mets. 
[02:13:00]  That was a good one.  Where the overnight guy took out Jerry Grody's fucking knee.  Jerry Grody fucking.  At home plate.  Yeah.  Jerry Grody's limping into a home and this guy decides he's going to bum rush him at  the plate.  Grody was, yeah, he was playing home.  Yeah.  And I forgot his name.  The overnight guy fucking took Jerry Grody out.  Oh, that's right.  Grody was at the plate and the guy ran at him.  The guy with the long hair.  And Grody was pulling like one of those things like, hey, I'll block the plate.  Thinking the guy's just going to go, oh, you got me.  No, he plows through him.  Like it's both their rookie years. 
[02:13:30]  Takes out a Mets legend.  Yeah.  Guy was done.  Still suffering from that knee injury from a dumb softball game at a dumb radio station.  Ah, yeah.  Go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius X.  Sirius X.  You don't fuck a bitch who thinks she can be number one.  I cheat on my girl.  It's with fat bitches that know what my girl look like.  And go.  Number two is good.  Even number three.  Three, three, three, three, three. 
[02:14:00]  Because I've been saying, look, I'm a decent motherfucker.  Just because I want some side pussy.  Just because I want other pussy as opposed to yours doesn't make me evil.  Dudes want side pussy.  You're never going to meet a girl whose hymen ain't broken.  You know what I'm saying?  I said a pussy smell like mini virgin.  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  I got no self-esteem.  Your side pussy.  God damn, you got some nice titties.  Ooh, to put it safely, I'm cool with number three. 
[02:14:30]  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy, go get some side.  What women do have to understand is that we look.  That's a part of our soul.  We don't bleed every month.  We don't fucking sit down to pee.  We don't pop babies out.  The one thing that we suffer with is when we're committed.  And women should understand what commitment is.  It's a commitment to us, not commitment to them.  It's a commitment that I can be not a piece of shit one day in my life.  Um, that it doesn't solve the problem of strange twat everywhere. 
[02:15:00]  One side pussy.  We don't have the tools to fight young, delicious women.  That say, say, say, treatise, I want to fuck you bad.  First of all, any bitch who doesn't want her asshole licked is an asshole.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s. 
[02:15:30]  They give you the uncut dope.  And then as soon as you go, they go, got you, punk motherfuckers.  That's what they do.  And it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it. 
[02:16:00]  Nigga, what are you talking about?  Dude, want side pussy.  Dude, won't tell anyone that we get a fuck or twice a week.  Your side pussy.  Hey, can I lick your asshole?  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  But I'm more nasty.  Ooh, your side pussy.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga.  Ooh, I want to fuck you bad.  But trees.  How you gonna say no to me?  Your side pussy. 
[02:16:30]  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Black Hole Sun, won't you come?  Wash the blaze of rain.  Black Hole Sun, won't you come?  Anyone know why we're playing this?  I don't get it. 
[02:17:00]  Do you know it?  Black Hole Sun.  There's always a theme with the music.  I don't get this one, Iraq.  Sorry.  Sorry, Iraq.  Sammy Sweetheart will be in studio in minutes.  She's got an amazing bio, I gotta tell you.  Look at this bio that I'm looking at, Ant.  We get a one sheet on every guest, and wow.  I don't even know where to begin with this one.  Opie, let me tell you something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is purely my fault slash preference.  But I didn't want it to be what you got.  Me and you are two separate people. 
[02:17:30]  Sure.  I was perfectly happy with getting the name, the time they're coming in, where they're  from, and when the show airs.  Yes.  That's what I got.  Because I hated getting three or four sheets, and then going like, who the fuck is this?  What time?  So I got one sheet that goes right there, and it's like, hey Sammy, so 9 a.m.  Jersey Shore, Thursday, 10 p.m. MTV.  That's what I like.  It doesn't mean all of a sudden now Opie gets what I preferred.  Opie liked his other sheet.  I was going with a joke.  Relax. 
[02:18:00]  I was basically saying...  I'm going with a joke, too.  Our staff!  I was making a joke like she doesn't have...  This is her bio.  If you were writing a full bio, this is what it would look like.  That was the joke.  Of course it would.  That was the joke, but you took it somewhere else.  I know.  I mean, look at Emmett Smith.  I like bashing the staff at every turn.  Look at Emmett Smith.  There's like 12, 15 bullet points, and for Sammy Sweetheart, well, Jersey Shore, Thursday,  at 10 p.m. on MTV.  See, it looked like my sheet.  Which confused me, but then you have the big Emmett Smith one, and I have Emmett Smith's 
[02:18:30]  930 game on his book.  I was just checking out her bio, and like I said, it's an amazing bio.  Look at this thing.  Lots to talk about with CBS VR.  If she has a little chub, short interview.  If she's not showing her legs, she's out of here, Sam.  Okay.  She is gone.  So now we're in that weird zone where we just wait for her.  Wait for a guest.  Where's Jimmy going?  Just to give this to Gary.  Jimmy's going to give that. 
[02:19:00]  Jimmy's conducting show business.  No, believe me.  Jimmy's conducting show business.  And I mean show biz.  The business or show.  Not like show biz, but show business, because that shit's got to be dealt with.  I hear you.  They're complaining about the flyer and the...  Why didn't Gary know about the flyer ahead of time?  I don't know if he did or not.  I mean, I just...  Oh, I don't care.  Just complaining about that and the lawyers and stuff like that.  I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  Jimmy, I've seen you had two footballs.  It's only one. 
[02:19:30]  The other one is a case.  Can I have a football?  It's only one football.  Oh, it's a case.  Yes, sir.  It's only one ball.  It's a case and a football.  Can we kick field goals down the hall?  I cannot imagine how many things you have in your apartment and how much room you have.  We have literally watched you bring tons of stuff in and outside.  I have stuff that...  What I need to do is redo my apartment.  It's a sight to be seen.  But it's unbelievable.  I would love to see it.  I'm not happy with the way it is.  Like a museum.  But it's not... 
[02:20:00]  The way I have it set up is kind of cheesy.  I have to do...  I have to buy more furniture and some drapes and hook these things.  I have boxing gloves I want to frame.  And I'll never be able to get all of it up.  No.  But...  The brochure is coming back already.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Oh, it's coming back.  It must be finished.  Gary!  They got our pictures.  Where's he going?  It's all finished.  Oh, he's going to put it in the trash.  Going...  Along with his resume.  Did you miss us?  We're back.  Hello. 
[02:20:30]  He's in there now.  What is he doing in there?  I don't know.  He's just smacking a rock in the face.  What...  I hope he's not in there looking for insertion.  Oh, he's coming in.  Oh, shit.  You asked for it.  During show.  Nice.  I like this.  You asked for it.  During show.  Here it comes.  It's the during show stop-in by Gary.  I'll be completely honest with you.  I don't give a shit at this point.  But Jimmy's very upset at our placement on the brochure.  Yes.  I don't know whose mic you want me to...  Well, there's no mics over there.  Sammy Sweetheart.  I guess the one not being used is good. 
[02:21:00]  There you go.  You could start there.  That was far as...  Shows you how often I'm...  Jimmy, very upset about the placement.  I was not happy.  Yes.  On the brochure.  No pictures.  He's right.  And our logo's really tiny and it's under, what, Oprah's left tit or something?  I think with just longevity with the company, we probably would merit a little photo at this  point.  On any type of thing, I think we're known, we're synonymous with satellite radio, the  Opie and Anthony show.  I think we should have our picture on some of these things that are going around. 
[02:21:30]  And we do quality radio.  That was yogurt and blueberries, by the way.  Anyone, if you won the pool.  I like it.  Yeah, if you're looking for someone to argue with you, you got the wrong guy.  Yeah.  You should be there.  Nobody from...  Nobody who's involved with the show had a chance to review it like we do a lot of pieces  before they go out.  Yeah, before they go out.  New glasses?  New glasses.  Oh, my God.  Look like you're from the turn of the century. 
[02:22:00]  No, you know what that is, by the way?  It's a new look for Gary.  Heinrich Himmler.  Oh, yes.  Heinrich Himmler wore those same glasses and we know how far he went.  Gary's been walking around mumbling, I'm not going to take this shit anymore.  Gary's really frightening me.  He said Himmert Blatter didn't get to see the flyer.  It went by both of us.  So who's the schmuck that was in charge of that?  I will find that out.  The schmuck.  What happened?  I don't know.  They probably don't like...  What do you think was?  ...being called that.  We're probably our best worst enemies or worst best enemies.  Well, that shit should go through you guys, obviously. 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  And what about the 9-11 audio?  Jimmy, very upset about the 9-11 audio.  We can't replay it on Sunday.  I think we will be able to play it.  I think we will be able to play it.  Oh, what?  I think we will be able to play it after Jim and I talked.  I went back up and talked to our fine legal department.  I think we'll work things out today.  I just need to wait to hear about CBS.  It's a news event, so we don't have to ask CBS.  You know what?  We don't want to.  After all that...  Yeah, you know what?  Let's just...  We want the 9-12 stuff.  Yes.  The 9-10 stuff.  That was a fun show.  9-10.  I would love to know what we were doing on 9-10. 
[02:23:00]  Someone out there knows.  Now, that's the good show.  What was the show we did before the whole world changed?  9-10 before everything changed.  I bet you it was some girl shoving something up her pussy.  That way, it was a Tuesday morning?  So, it was Monday.  So, it was Monday.  Monday after a long weekend.  Uh-huh.  So, suffice to say, I was probably feeling a little fuzzy around the edges.  A little loopy?  A little loopy.  It was afternoon drive.  Wait a minute.  I got a good night's sleep.  Hmm. 
[02:23:30]  September 10th.  September 10th.  Could we possibly have done that day?  I think it was our first day back from vacation, too.  I think.  No way.  I was supposed to have something air that night on a channel I had filmed in New York.  I was riding around looking for hookers.  It didn't air.  They pushed it back for the Metro Channel.  It was actually pretty good.  I watched it recently, and it just never aired.  It never aired.  It was September 10th of 2001.  Well, I think it's about time to air it.  Absolutely.  I looked the same.  I was driving a Saturn.  I couldn't find a prostitute.  I won't be listening to the channel on Sunday.  I've never listened to that audio. 
[02:24:00]  No, I haven't either.  Never listened to it.  I don't want to.  I'm sure we got everything wrong, but we didn't know shit about what was happening.  The situation was very fluid.  We blamed Howard Stern, if I remember correctly.  I almost did a plug in the middle of my phone in, but I remember deciding against it.  I just knew.  It wouldn't have washed.  Kevin from Connecticut knows what we were doing on 9-10.  How does he know?  2001.  Is this true, Kevin?  Lousy radio.  I don't remember what you were doing, but I have the show. 
[02:24:30]  I can post it.  Oh, Jesus.  You have the show?  I want the topics that day.  You can't post it.  That's illegal.  No, you can't post the illegal.  We're going after all you illegal posters soon, by the way.  Something as legal as that.  We want to keep it all legal.  It was about Chandra Levy.  Remember?  She was on the news and stuff.  All right.  Chandra Levy was a big story.  Yeah, that got washed away.  It was washed.  Gary Condit was ruined because of that, and he didn't do anything.  I want topics.  Full month.  How are you working it out, Gary?  Don't pay those bastards.  What?  CBS?  Yeah, don't pay those fuckers. 
[02:25:00]  No, no, we're not paying.  Pay us.  I don't think they're going to want any money.  So how are you going to work it out?  I think you could work it out because it's a bunch of lawyer.  I think it's a news thing that you're just allowed to play it.  That's a news event.  I'm serious.  What are we, Huntley Brinkley?  We sure are.  I don't know.  That's a whole way back.  You're America's most trusted news source.  Yes, yes.  America's most trusted news source.  I'm here on September 11th.  The O'Brien Anthony program.  You were in Long Island that day because you guys couldn't get into the city.  Yep.  Yes, I do remember that. 
[02:25:30]  But I don't remember the day before.  That's when we met Sean Hannity.  We've said that a million times.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he didn't get in the city that day, so we all were in the same studios somewhere  else.  And I was doing, with my girlfriend, my car had broken down the night before, so I was  towed to New Jersey with my ex, who I still talk to, by the way.  She's still completely crazy.  Oh, I mean.  It's not a ham, it's a girl.  See, I was insinuating.  And she's still nutty.  Yeah.  Fruitcake nutty?  Bat shit?  Oh, is it? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  That's what I was with on 9-11.  She was at my house.  We woke up to Florentine and woke us up.  Oh, wait.  Do you have, on September 10th, you were doing Good Times impressions?  Oh, no, really?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, good times.  Gary, you don't have to stand there, all, clearly.  No, no, no.  Thank you.  We're not going to beat you up.  We've only been back for a vacation today.  It's probably for your own.  It's for your best interest that you're not.  You did good, by the way.  Yeah.  I'm proud of you that you came in the studio.  That was good.  I'm very proud of him.  You know what?  I kind of like that, that he comes in here.  Like a man, like a man.  He's learned a lot from his summer internship there, Sam. 
[02:26:30]  I'm very proud of him.  This is 9-10-2001.  Now, everyone's doing the 9-11 thing.  What the fuck was going on the day before?  Wait, can we play the 9-10 show on 9-11?  I would love to do that instead.  That's so much different than what everyone else is doing.  Yeah.  We don't have the rights.  This is the day before the world change.  Well, if they can figure out 9-10.  Yeah.  All right, let's hear this.  Let's see.  Visit the Museum of Television and Radio.  Unfortunately not, I...  What the hell was that?  With commercials.  Oh, boy.  Let mama go out and open. 
[02:27:00]  James!  Mama, he's the devil.  Was this a replay?  Was that when Stephen Lynch was in?  Well, we played a lot of...  Well, yeah, we did more.  We don't want to give all our secrets away.  We played a lot of shit many times over and over again.  We rarely play something over again.  Now we do it two seconds later when someone says something dumb.  Right?  Wee wee.  Wee wee, like wee wee. 
[02:27:30]  Choo choo.  I don't know.  Choo choo.  It's always some two.  It's a legendary bit, but we played a lot of bits going into break, so we didn't have  to do as much radio.  Let me go forward a little in this show.  Try to find actual live broadcasts with the mother and say, leave our son alone.  Because the grandma was trying to get him to kill himself so she could be with him.  What a great deep voice I had.  That's a goddamn final song.  Always good.  All right, so there you go.  The guy has dead guy voice box and can now speak like the dead guy.  Brian, what are you doing? 
[02:28:00]  I was a waiter at a catering place, and they had a cancer benefit one night.  I had an entire table of people with voice boxes I had to take the orders from.  Really?  Oh, my God.  I couldn't.  And the next day, by the way, the whole world changed.  Jesus, man.  Opie loved his days.  Voice box Monday.  I can't believe it.  Holy shit. 
[02:28:30]  Let's get that on a shirt, Sam.  Voice box Monday.  All right, we got some slob outside the studio.  Who's that?  I'm not going to tell you.  It doesn't.  What?  That person works here?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Don't mess with that.  Ixnang, I guess.  I have no idea.  There's just no reason for it.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  So can we play more of that audio tomorrow as we lead up to the 10th anniversary of 9-10-2001?  It would have been really prudent of somebody during this show to say, hey, by the way, everybody, 
[02:29:00]  stay out of the towers tomorrow.  If you're at the airports, arrest these people.  Give them the names of that.  But instead, we wasted our time doing a shtick and voice box Monday.  I don't get why we did that.  We failed.  We had a very powerful thing going on, and we failed.  We certainly did.  We didn't use our powers for good.  Nobody knew.  Terrible.  Oh. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, right.  I knew there was a loophole there or something.  And scene.  Right.  But what knows, we canceled the contest, right?  Uh, yeah.  We canceled the contest, but we knows by now.  He's infuriated.  Tell that shiteater to stop tweeting me about his dumb uncle in Tampa.  I don't care.  He wants to come to the show, let him buy a ticket.  He's too big to do the after show.  He refused. 
[02:30:00]  I mean, I didn't ask him to go on it.  But he refuses to go on it.  He made a statement that he wouldn't do it.  Why?  He wasn't invited, but he made a statement that he would not do.  Well, that's horse shit.  What's wrong with that motherfucker?  I guess Mick Foley is not as big as Bobo is.  Mick Foley will do the after show, not Bobo.  Oh, yeah.  Mick Foley did it.  Lover Boy.  Sure.  Yeah, Lover Boy.  Lover Boy.  Sammy, running late?  I'll find out.  Yeah.  Yeah, find out.  We could take a break then, maybe.  You know what?  Because we're behind breaks.  I actually got to take a piss.  Okay.  This is perfect timing. 
[02:30:30]  All right, we'll do a quick break.  When we get back, I think Sammy Sweetheart from the Jersey Shore will be in the studio.  And then Emmett Smith within a half hour.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show on The Virus, Sirius XM.  All right, here's the problem.  Ah, yes.  We got Emmett Smith.  He's hanging outside the studio.  He's just kind of playing with the football.  We gave him the football to play with.  We figured he would know what to do with that.  Because we have to get Sammy Sweetheart in here first. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  So Emmett, I appreciate you just hanging out.  We'll get you in a few minutes to promote your book, Game On.  Game On.  Game On.  We could just talk to him now for a couple minutes.  But no, and then what?  Sammy Sweetheart comes in, and we got to, you know, it's awkward.  Yeah, Sammy Sweetheart, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jersey Shore, Thursdays at 10 p.m. on MTV.  Yeah.  And I guess we'll talk about that.  You watch, though, right?  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  She Sam watches, right?  What were you going to say?  I watch.  She's just a downer, man.  Is she a downer?  She's got really nice legs.  She got a little chub to her now that she's in Italy, and she's still pining over this Ronnie  guy.  And the rest of the guys are just trying to have fun and fucking party and stuff.  But you know what?  And she's ruining the vibe of the whole house.  See, I watch them.  I feel like she keeps the show episodic.  It's not just...  I don't even know what she does.  It's not just a matter of, oh, these guys are... 
[02:32:00]  She does this with her hair a lot.  She plays with her hair a lot in the clubs and gets mad because she's drunk.  It's not just a matter, though, of...  I know those girls.  These guys are just amazing.  Because then when she's in the house, she just does this with her hair, but she's not  mad because she's not drunk.  Right.  But then she goes to the club, she gets drunk, and then she starts thinking all this shit about  Ronnie, and then there's fights and stuff.  And then she allows Ronnie to...  Of course.  ...basically destroy everything she owns, and then she goes back to home.  Yeah, but Ronnie also has a problem of going back to her. 
[02:32:30]  He just loves to smush.  I hate that word.  Smush?  Smush.  You don't have a smush room in your house?  Smush room?  What is smushing?  It's like hooking up, you know?  It's when you smush your fucking genitals together.  That's right.  It makes a smushing noise.  And then one goes into the other.  Right.  It goes smush, smush, smush.  That's kind of clever.  Right.  Jersey Shore is a very clever show.  Very clever.  Very clever with their catchphrases for white people.  Because white people don't normally coin a lot of phrases.  Except for, you know, the eagle has landed. 
[02:33:00]  Things like that.  Yeah.  But for cool, hip phrases.  Yeah, I like Vinny.  I like Pauly Deke.  I liked the situation after he came on our show.  I do like the JWoww.  She was very different when we met her.  What about the snookster?  Don't like her.  Oh.  It's a shame Sammy's interview is going to be so short.  You know, being 15 minutes late, why would you do that when the greatest running back  in history is coming into the fucking studio?  Oh, shit.  Snooki?  Fucking disaster.  I think she's walking down the hall around her.  Oh, of course.  Look at the entourage around her. 
[02:33:30]  Entourage?  Look at the peaks.  That's Roland.  Oh, I thought that was a lot of people.  Oh, my God.  Mighty glasses.  Sammy, sweetheart.  Not showing her legs, Sam.  Get outside the door and tell her to fucking go home.  Or get some scissors.  Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  No, she does have sort of an entourage coming along with her.  An entourage.  What is there?  There's my stylist.  There's this.  Yeah, they're just regular people from Jersey.  She's very lovely.  Yeah, Sammy.  Is there water for her for a guest? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Throw that bottle.  Throw that bottle.  I want out of tap water.  You're water forever.  Yeah, I want out of tap water.  I got a bottle of water here.  Yeah, bring in Sammy, sweetheart, from the Jersey Shore, Thursdays.  Come right in.  At 10 p.m. on MTV.  Hello, Sammy.  Hi.  Hi, Sammy.  How are you?  Sammy, how are you?  Good.  Take a seat.  We're actually on the air.  We don't do the, oh, come on in, and then you do that small chit-chat, and then you  get on the air, and you've got to repeat it, the chit-chat that you had off the air? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, it sucks.  She's done a few of these by now.  Thank you.  So you hit some traffic coming in?  Yeah, it was brutal out there this morning.  Where are we coming in from?  Jersey.  That's a dumb question.  Yeah, I'm a Jersey girl.  The only one.  Oh, no.  There's a new girl, Dina.  She's from Jersey, too.  Wait, your tunnel bridge?  What do you do?  The Lincoln Tunnel.  Ah, Lincoln Tunnel.  Big spender.  I guess.  It's very expensive, though.  You've got to do it again here.  Yeah.  Where is Jersey?  Easy pass, or you've got to wait with the schmucks in line?  A little bit of both.  Ah, you've got to wait.  Where's your easy pass? 
[02:35:00]  All the time, easy pass.  You guys are holding us back.  You people are holding us back.  I hate that.  Girl.  You're using our easy pass.  I have my own easy pass, but sometimes I don't always drive, so sometimes I have to wait  in line, you know?  Put it in your pocket.  Just walk around with it.  Have you actually been with people that don't have easy pass, like, in the last 10 years?  Kill them.  I won't associate with them.  No.  I won't talk to them.  I don't really know.  I feel like everybody has an easy pass these days.  They better.  Do you know a comedian named Rich Voss?  No.  Exactly.  We hate him.  A comedian we know who refuses to give easy pass. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, he really needs one.  We're in New Jersey.  I was raised in New Jersey.  Hazlitt.  Where's Hazlitt?  Where were you born?  I was born in Bayonne.  Oh, my mom's cousins are from Bayonne.  They live in North Brunswick.  There used to be this park by the water.  It was this big park in Bayonne.  7th Street Park.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  We left very early.  Went to Jersey City.  Parking rides and not many parks, though.  The rest of the area.  Why did you have to leave Bayonne, Jimmy?  Is there a story behind that?  No, no.  I was just a baby, and we moved out and went to Jersey City, and then it was time to move 
[02:36:00]  out.  I think we got squeezed out immediately.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  You got pushed out of Jersey City.  We got pushed out to North Brunswick.  Well, that happens to some communities.  Sure.  You know, it's best to just flee.  How far from Edison were you?  Because I lived there, too.  Um, about a half hour.  Oh, okay.  That wasn't even funny.  See, in a different life, she and I may have went out if I was a lot younger and a lot  better looking and in better shape.  Jimmy really wants to be on the Jersey Shore.  I do.  He wants to be a cast member.  I want to be like the...  Can you give me a fist bump?  Yeah.  Yeah, do it, Jimmy.  Probably not the way you're accustomed to.  Do it.  Do it. 
[02:36:30]  Do it.  No, I kind of want to be like the Cousin Oliver.  Like, I want to be the one who just kind of comes in and wrecks everybody's fun in the  hot tub.  Wrecks everybody's fun?  Yeah.  You should get in the hot tub.  Yeah.  Join the fun.  Like, if you and your boyfriend were fooling around, I'd get in and go, come on, guys,  you're not married.  I'd sit between you.  Oh.  What?  You would be the downer of the show.  So, why Ronnie there?  I know you're going to be asked this a lot today, Sammy, but you're really hot, and you  could have anyone, and you keep going back to this Ronnie thing, and it's really frustrating  to us people that watch this show. 
[02:37:00]  I understand, but it's a TV show.  You're only seeing an hour, you know, of the goods, and I'm being filmed 24-7 for like  a month and a half, and you know what makes TV?  Like, drama, you know, fighting, and that's the way that I come off, but you're not seeing  the really good side that I have with myself, being, you know, independent and having fun,  you know, say, in Italy, and, you know, being myself.  You see me instead having the bad side of a relationship, and you don't see the good  side, and I wish that they would show more of the good side, because I keep going back 
[02:37:30]  to Ron, because when we do have a connection together, it's an amazing thing, and it is  fun, and it's enlightening, and it's great, and you don't always see that.  But that isn't what people want to see.  Yeah, but the whole house is a drama.  That's that TV.  You can't.  You want to see me being happy and boring, you know what I mean?  You want to see fights, and you want to see, you know.  The whole house rolls their eyes, though.  Every time you guys get back to here, you're like, oh, fuck, we just want to hang on and  have fun here.  I don't really care what anybody has to say.  I like who I am as a person.  I like what I'm doing in my life, and if I'm making a wrong decision, I'm able to look  back and be like, ew, why did I do that? 
[02:38:00]  Or I can actually reflect myself, which is great, and I can learn from it.  But he destroyed all your stuff.  Yeah.  That was a very sad episode, when you picked up your glasses and they were broken.  You know what?  That was a hard time for me.  I was going through a little bit of a rough time, so I chose to, you know, leave the shore for a  little bit and kind of take care of myself.  But were you going, what I like to call, bat shit crazy?  Some girls?  You know what?  They go a little bat shit crazy?  It was just a time in my life that wasn't the best time for me, and unfortunately, all  of, you know, everybody got to see that, so.  Yeah.  Well, that is part of the, you know, the whole deal with the show, which kind of sucks. 
[02:38:30]  What's that?  You got something?  No one makes me stronger.  There are times, guys, you know, there are times we got to come in on this show, and we  certainly don't want to be having a good time, that's for sure.  Right.  Oh, it smells good.  What is that?  She has a bit, everybody has a bad day here and there, you know?  Yeah, yeah, and you like that.  It's not always perfect all the time.  You got your own perfume?  Roland just handed me this.  Holy shit.  It's called Dangerous for Women.  Yeah, Dangerous.  It's so appropriate that I'm holding this.  What is this?  A semen sample from you?  Why, auntie?  Because it has the any sweethearts to it, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  It actually smells really good.  I did smell it.  It smells like, uh...  Yeah, man.  A little almonds, a little bit of vanilla.  Yeah, but it's not...  It's a really nice smell.  Usually celebrity perfumes smell terrible, but that's great.  I actually...  What does the bottle look like?  A little of that somewhere else.  Spray it on you.  Why don't you just have some...  Give me it.  Because I don't want to smell like a woman.  Give me it.  That's not bad.  Oh, that smells nice.  That smells all right.  Oh, yay.  Yeah, Dangerous for Women.  You're going to smell great.  I know.  Jimmy's going to smell like a brook.  Yeah, but Emmett Smith is coming in.  He'll want to hug me because I'll smell good. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, cool.  Let me see.  And the two M's and Sammy's sweetheart are hearts.  She knows what she's doing.  It's dangerously sweet, just like me.  It smells really good.  It's pretty goddamn good.  I would actually wear this if it wasn't getting me beaten up in most moments.  Yeah, literally.  How much input did you have on the smell itself?  Did you say, hey, that smells like shit.  Change it.  Yeah, because I would not put my name on something that I was not proud of.  Really?  Honestly, I would not.  We do every day.  All I have, to be honest with you, is this perfume, and I'm really excited about it. 
[02:40:00]  I wouldn't have literally put so much effort into doing a product if I didn't feel like  it was me.  Did you have to go to the factory and watch people with paper hats look at you like, oh,  Christ, we've got to make this shit because of her.  No celebrity making a perfume.  They can believe they know what they're doing.  Oh, God.  I want to be like a business entrepreneur, and this is the first start, which was cool  about the show, is I was able to meet some people and have some opportunities that I  not necessarily would have.  It does open up some doors.  I'll tell you that.  Just some doors, so I'm really excited about this product.  I've got to have a few tickets.  And Sammy doesn't promote as much.  No, I really don't. 
[02:40:30]  You don't promote like the rest of the guys.  I don't really push myself out there.  I like to be more settled with one item or one product and really push that, or me, myself  as a career, my brand name, I really want to push myself in the right direction and  not just throw my name out everywhere.  Right.  Getting into those sweet tarts, those candies, that'll be funny.  Sammy, sweet tarts.  No?  Well, it goes together.  How was Italy?  You never know.  You liked Italy?  It was terrible.  Italy was awesome.  I loved Italy. 
[02:41:00]  The food was delicious.  Yeah, a lot of Italians?  You guys would love the food.  Yeah, but the Italians were different than Italians here in America.  Very different.  The Italian food was different than America.  There's no chicken parm in Italy.  No?  There's no mozzarella sticks.  There's no fried foods.  What the hell's that about?  I don't know.  That's Italian food.  What are they doing over there?  I don't know.  It's just different, but the food's delicious.  It's fresh, and it tastes like candy, everything.  Everything tastes like candy out there, so it's great.  Oh, okay.  And why are the Italians different than the Italians here? 
[02:41:30]  What's the difference?  All the people out there, it's so weird, because everything's so small, even the people.  When you go shopping, you can't find extra large shirts.  They just don't make them.  Really?  Yeah.  Because we're a big, obese, fat nation.  That is what it is.  No, but even a guy like me, I'm not in good shape.  I'm not obese.  It's like a large there is really snug on me.  Don't sell yourself short, Jim.  The people there are so small.  The roads.  There's, you know, the roads are so small that you can barely fit a van to drive through  the roads.  Well, they're made for chariots.  There's cobblestone roads. 
[02:42:00]  Chariots.  Exactly.  No, really.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  It's very historical.  Paint that shit over and make them wider.  Let's go.  But you liked it, right?  I loved it.  I would go back.  It's like you got to go get pizza or something, right?  Pizza was great.  We worked at a pizzeria and that was the coolest thing ever.  Oh, you did?  You worked at a pizzeria.  That was cool.  Did they have good bread?  Pizza bread.  The dough, I mean.  The dough was awesome.  Because that's what makes pizza good.  Did you throw it up in the air and spin it?  I did, actually.  It was so much fun.  I loved it.  Who was it?  Pauline, I think, said that the people there were not as likely to run over to the cameras 
[02:42:30]  as people here are.  No.  They just viewed it a little bit differently.  They kind of let us, like, they really, you know, let us live our lives, which was cool.  Because here it's different.  And they come back here and it's like, blah.  Yeah.  Because we did come back here.  We went straight from Italy to film and seaside.  So it was a little crazy, you know.  Seaside's crazy anyway.  We got two different ends of the spectrum.  Right.  A bunch of jadrules down there.  I like your perfume.  Perfume's all right, huh?  I'm hoping, because we have probably the greatest running back in history coming in very, very  shortly because he's a rock.  And he notices that you smell really nice. 
[02:43:00]  I'm hoping Emmett Smith notices that I smell really good.  Like a girl?  Not like a girl, but like...  You kind of smell like a girl.  No, but sometimes if you wear a woman's perfume a little bit, a nice one, women like it.  Because women like that smell and they'll like the way you smell.  Sammy?  You made a check, women.  Do you like when a guy smells like a girl?  Sam?  You never know.  You never know.  You'd be like, ooh, what's that smell?  And it's you.  Yeah.  Sammy has really, really nice legs, but she chose not to show them off today, by the  way.  Just for the record.  Well, it's not, you know what?  It's a little chilly out.  That's why.  It's not a summer day out there today.  Very nice legs.  Unfortunately. 
[02:43:30]  Amazing legs, actually.  We got a little rain.  It's all from soccer.  Oh, you play soccer?  Oh, so they're banged up pretty good?  Yeah, they're banged up pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get any shoes in the shin where it leaves a little notch in your shin bone?  I have.  I've got, you know, soccer's a little rough in there, you know?  I've gotten, you know, shin kicked before.  Hey, it ain't no field hockey.  No.  Did you ever play that?  No, I've never played field hockey ever.  Remember the field hockey girls?  They were usually, they used to like each other a little more.  Umbro shorts. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Long knee length, satiny shorts.  Yeah.  Mullets.  That stick was made for the G-spot.  Yeah, you know the type of girls.  Absolutely.  So when you got into this whole thing, how was the family?  What did they say about it?  Like, oh.  You know what's cool about my family is they're such great supporters that if they hated  the show, they would still support me.  If they loved the show, they would still support me.  And that's what's cool about my family.  And, you know, they stick with me through everything.  Were you acting beforehand or anything?  No.  Honestly.  So this just came out of the blue.  It was like a freak thing. 
[02:44:30]  And I just, you know, became lucky and stepped into this.  You know, I was.  Tell us the story, quickly.  Okay.  I was, you know, I live at the shore.  So, you know, there was like a survey online.  Like, oh, what's it like a weekend down the shore?  And I don't know if you know of Belmore in Jersey.  Oh, yeah.  I like that area.  And they had a house down there.  And I was like, oh, let me fill this survey out.  Like, I was a joke.  Like, I could just literally name everything that goes on at the shore house that happens in real life.  And I'll see what happens.  And they're like, oh, come in for an interview.  And it just led from there.  Wow.  And I had no idea that I was going to be doing a TV show like this.  I had no idea really what I was getting myself into. 
[02:45:00]  It kind of was like, oh, this is my life.  This is easy, like, to me.  God, so you could have filled that out and said, well, we've read this and now we have to kill you.  Like, you didn't know what it was even for.  Truthfully, it was like a survey of, like, define a weekend at the shore.  And I just, like, filled it out.  Like, not really nonchalantly knowing what, you know, that I would actually be here with you guys right now, you know, talking to you.  What a thrill, I know.  And what a, when, so when you got the show, did your family or you think like, wow, this is going to, you know, take off? 
[02:45:30]  Or did you just think, oh, boy, something to do for us somewhere?  I thought it was fun.  And I didn't know if it was going to take off.  I didn't know if it would be a complete, you know, drop and then nobody would enjoy it.  I had no idea.  And I just kind of did it, like, went with it.  And I'm actually glad I did it.  It's like a, it's an amazing experience for me to go through.  And I'll always look back and have wonderful memories.  Are you guys, are you guys done?  Right now we're done filming.  We filmed.  No, I know you're done with, I mean, done.  Is that it for this version of the Jersey Shore?  I have no idea.  Like, I really never know. 
[02:46:00]  Because you did Italy and then you went back to Seaside.  Yeah, I have no idea.  We never know.  It's like, if you want, I don't know.  I don't know.  The ratings are still ridiculously strong.  I didn't, I, no offense, I didn't think it would last this long.  Where the ratings would just stay as high as they are.  And it's on Sundays at what time?  10 o'clock?  Thursdays at 10.  Thursdays at 10 o'clock.  Thursdays at 10.  Perfume is very nice.  Thank you.  It smells so good.  It's called Sweetheart.  You can get it at Mandy's stores.  The girls' clothing stores or Dangerous Perfume.  Absolutely.  Really?  Which girls' store?  Mandy's.  Oh, Mandy's. 
[02:46:30]  I've seen those around.  Panicking.  Jimmy is panicking.  Jimmy's hero is going to be here in two minutes.  Jimmy's hero.  Do you like football?  I love the Jets.  Yay.  But the question remains, do you like football?  I do love football, yeah.  I'm a huge football fan.  Yeah.  You're not a Jets fan?  No, Cowboy fan.  Cowboy fan.  That's why.  Emmett Smith's coming in.  Oh, yeah.  Greatest running back of all time, some would say.  Do you hang out with anybody from the show when you're off? 
[02:47:00]  My best friend is Dina.  I love her.  Yeah, because you know what?  She's the complete opposite from me, and she makes me happy.  She is just, she is such a positive person.  She's really cool.  She's down to earth.  She's not fake.  She's just an awesome friend to me.  Who's fake on the show?  So you're saying you're not down to earth, you're fake.  No, she's just.  Because you said you're the opposite of her.  You did say that.  I'm opposite because she is a ball of fire, and she really, she, I'm very more cool, calm  collective, and she is like, wow, outrageous ball of fire.  So she bounces me out. 
[02:47:30]  We, uh, Snooki won't do our show.  No, Snooki won't come on.  She's the only one.  Yeah, we're friends with a bunch of you guys now.  This is fun, why?  I don't know.  I don't know what her problem is.  Little, little bitch.  I said it.  I said it.  No.  No.  You know why?  Because she's cool.  Everybody else came on.  We might have made fun of her ass when she was a little on the weight and stuff, but  I thought we were past that.  She looks fabulous now.  I saw her recently.  I'm actually proud of her.  She looks great.  Yeah, she looks fabulous.  She looks fabulous.  Oh, yeah.  Thursday at 10 o'clock.  Oh, well.  Dangerous.  Oh, Emmett Smith.  I'm out of time over here.  Emmett Smith, do you watch the Jersey Shore, sir? 
[02:48:00]  No, I do not.  Oh, no, I do not.  Hi, Emmett.  I see.  That's Jim Norton.  I'm Anthony.  Hi.  What's up, Emmett?  Hi.  Can we have Emmett here and then you there and we can all talk together?  Oh, yeah.  You guys can make out.  No, I don't want to make out.  I just love Emmett Smith.  I have no idea what's going on here in the studio today.  I don't either.  Emmett.  Emmett, how are you, sir?  God damn, look at that earring.  Yeah, Sammy's sweetheart.  Nice earring.  Sweetie, I got five kids and I'm chasing them around from this event to that event.  Oh, no.  I'm not getting home.  Busy man. 
[02:48:30]  Huh?  Uh-oh, what happened?  They're taking Emmett Smith out?  No, they're not taking Emmett Smith out.  What's going on?  I hope not.  What's up?  Thank you very much, Sammy.  You're welcome to stay if you like.  I'm great.  Thank you.  The perfume is very...  Thank you.  Yeah, that's her perfume, by the way.  Sammy, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Sammy, thanks.  Please come back and see us again, will you?  Sammy, you could have taken my time.  Thank you.  Thanks, Sammy.  All right, Sammy Sweetheart from the Jersey Shore, Thursdays at 10 p.m. on MTV.  Yes, Sammy.  Pretty much.  We couldn't have had an ejector seat.  That would have worked faster. 
[02:49:00]  Wow, that was really mean.  I can't have anybody taking Emmett's time.  Y'all did her wrong, man.  Y'all making me feel bad.  Y'all making me laugh.  No, no.  It's a time.  She was late.  Oh, God, let's go through this.  Oh, man, go through the pictures.  See, Emmett's too nice of God.  No, no, no.  Oh, you're too nice.  Is this her cell phone?  Oh, man.  No, that's Sammy.  Is this your cell phone?  No.  Okay.  Oh, that's probably Sam's.  Oh, there's nothing on there, then.  Sorry.  That's all right.  Boredom.  Thank you.  Oh, she signed a bottle of the air.  Yeah, her perfume actually smells pretty good. 
[02:49:30]  Really?  You can probably smell it.  It's all over the studio.  And Jimmy's head.  I normally do, too, but I sprayed it on just to make her happy, and I was hoping that  you'd come in and go, hey, you smell pretty good.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  No, he wouldn't.  Jimmy's a huge fan.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're all fans of you.  Yeah.  But I'm a Jets fan, so, you know, I mean, what can I say?  I'm in New York.  I would expect to see a Jets fan or a Giants fan somewhere.  A couple, right?  Yeah, at least.  Somewhere.  But Jimmy is a massive Cowboys fan.  I'm not a fan of the overlapping seasons of these sports now.  They're getting a little out of hand.  When they're starting to talk football, I'm still, you know, I'm waiting for October. 
[02:50:00]  You think that's something?  It's crazy.  You think about something getting out of hand?  Youth sports are getting out of hand.  Oh, are they?  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  It's like year-round, right?  You really go do some research and figure that one out.  What do you mean?  The seasons are too long?  Well, the seasons are too long.  Kids are, it's becoming more specialized.  I mean, and it's costing you a ton of money.  Oh, I bet.  It's ridiculous.  Do you think that college should get...  And you're playing just about every weekend, Sundays included. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  So family members who want to go to church can't go to church because they've got to take the  child to the sport or they want to take the children to the sport.  Yeah, I'm a big church guy, Emmett.  Well, you know, I think everyone needs a little while.  Yeah, we'll be honest.  That's a little religion.  We all...  At the end of the day, you know, the Sabbath day.  Let's relax on the Sabbath day.  How about a little rest, right?  How about a little rest?  The Lord rested?  For us adults, we just keep going from Monday through Monday.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a constant grind, isn't it?  Like I said, I have five kids.  Three of them are very active in sports. 
[02:51:00]  And they're playing soccer, baseball, and my son occasionally wants to play football.  What are the ages?  My oldest daughter's 15.  I have a daughter that's 12 that plays select soccer, which is almost like a travel squad.  Sure.  Pretty good.  Are you...  I got to ask, because I'm a father too there.  Are you worried about like your kids going into football, knowing how vicious the sport is?  No, no, I think I'm going to allow my kids, well, my sons, to make whatever decision they choose to.  I'm not going to push them into football like my son played football for two years and then he's decided... 
[02:51:30]  But are you hoping maybe they move on to another sport or no?  You know, it's more important for my kids to be happy than for me because it's not a fulfillment for myself  because I've done what I need to do and I don't want them to have that additional pressure of guys like yourself  sitting around talking, well, I don't think Emmitt Smith Jr. is the same as his daddy.  Feeling that kind of pressure.  Like Marvis Frazier?  Yeah.  Or going out there saying like some parents saying, well, he should stick to football instead of this. 
[02:52:00]  I mean, it's just crazy pressure.  Let the kids be kids, man.  So you're not one of those annoying sidelines?  Probably not because you're a football player, so you don't need to prove yourself for your kids.  No, I'm very annoying on the sidelines.  Oh, are you really?  I want my kids to really do well.  And I want the team that they're playing for to win.  Oh, okay.  So I'm rooting on all the kids to go out there and have fun.  Imagine you're playing youth football and there's Emmitt Smith on the sideline.  You're just screaming, you suck.  I'm going to scream, but it won't be that.  Can you imagine? 
[02:52:30]  Emmitt Smith yelling at you from the sidelines.  Oh, don't think I haven't done it now.  Do you intimidate the referees?  It's got to be a threatening thing if you're a ref in like a Pop Warner League and Emmitt is yelling at you that you're a terrible ref.  Those guys are working basically for free, giving up their time.  It's got to be intimidating seeing him standing there on the sidelines, I would think.  What do you do to relax then if you've got so many things going on?  Well, I try to find my moments.  I try to pick out a Friday and go play golf and just to stay grounded some kind of way. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I need to relax.  I need to outlet myself.  I play video games with my kids.  Oh, yeah.  That's always fun.  I bet they beat you.  Yeah, well, sometimes.  Sometimes, yeah.  My son is only nine years old, so he thinks he can challenge me to Madden or to NCAA football and beat me, but he really can't.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Did you, when you were going through those early years with the Cowboys and there was all those legendary things with Irvin and the partying and all that stuff, did you get caught up in that or were you able to kind of sidestep it?  Well, my name didn't get caught up in it, but at the end of the day, I've seen some things and I've been around some things, but it's not my position to really divulge what I've seen. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, that's something I will take to the grave with me regardless, but the bottom line is at some point we all go through certain things.  And as I mentioned in my book, going through something is a character builder, and it affords you the opportunity to learn how to overcome obstacles and learn how to make some key decisions or some choices that are right for you. 
[02:54:00]  And I chose to do some things that I felt like was right as well.  I haven't read the whole book because we just got it a couple of days ago, but I've been looking through it, and there was a great story in there.  It's inspirational, and it's about following your dreams.  And there's a great point about when you're going to be inducted to the Hall of Fame, how your father kind of sprung this thing on you that you had no idea.  Right.  To me, there aren't many father-son moments.  And for my father and myself, that was a father-son moment.  I mean, a real, real father-son moment where I really felt my father's heart really reaching out to his son like, man, you just don't understand. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, I may have not have said these things to you before, but right now I want you to feel this moment.  And that's what I sensed from my dad at that time.  And it was so real for me.  What did he tell you?  Because I haven't...  He just basically said, son, you know, I had dreams of doing what you were doing, and that's playing professional football, obviously.  And he said, but my mom got sick.  I just want you to know, you're living my dream. 
[02:55:00]  You're living my dream.  Which is a real moment because I understood that he had choices he had to make, and some of them were very tough.  For example, my grandmother, his mom, was ill at the time.  So he was getting to go off to college or make a decision to go to college or to stay home and take care of his grandmother at that time.  And this is the time before Internet.  This is the time before Twitter.  This is the time before cars could really go 135 miles an hour.  For cell phones.  Yeah, before cell phones, et cetera, et cetera. 
[02:55:30]  And plus, this was a time where African-American families really probably couldn't afford to send their kids to school financially.  So he had a scholarship.  So he had to make a decision.  And he chose to stay home while my father, my grandfather, was actually working shift yard work.  So he had to care for his mom a little bit and do the things that he needed to do to become a young man.  So he gave up a football scholarship.  So he gave up a scholarship and pursued a different kind of career.  And obviously, our life was a little different. 
[02:56:00]  We grew up in housing projects in Pensacola, small, 138 at his court, small place.  And we eventually moved out.  What was the first thing you did when you went through the draft and how you kind of foresaw that you were going to play for the Cowboys?  And then as the draft is going on and on and your name is not getting called, are you starting to feel like I'm not going to play in the NFL?  Well, you know, you know, like certain things in life, people have an expectation, you know, have a certain kind of perceived notion what they want to happen. 
[02:56:30]  And you're going down a path and you see, OK, here's my opportunity.  This is it.  It's got to happen this way.  I believe this way.  This is what I was designed for.  And all of a sudden, somebody says, well, we project Emma Smith to go in the top 10.  OK, in the top 10, I don't see the Dallas Cowboys there.  So if I'm going to the top 10, maybe that means I would not be a Dallas Cowboy.  But, however, I get a chance to live out my dream of being a professional athlete. 
[02:57:00]  That's a great thing.  So then the top 10 go by, then you're not selected.  You're like, wow.  You're like, wow.  It's like a culture shock, right?  It's like, man, I'm watching Dallas go down a dream.  Maybe I should have stayed in school another year.  Maybe I would have been in the top 10.  Then all of a sudden, you see the Dallas Cowboys moving up.  Then it becomes a real moment.  I'm like, wow.  The Dallas Cowboys just called me.  Here I am.  Now only am I going to be a professional athlete, but I'm going to the team that I always wanted to play for.  And you said Jimmy Johnson actually called you personally? 
[02:57:30]  Jimmy called me personally and asked me, how would I like to wear a star on my helmet?  Oh, my gosh.  Man, you don't understand.  This has been my whole life passion to play for the Dallas Cowboys.  I'm playing for America's team.  And forget the 1-15.  We're going to win some games.  That's what I'm thinking in my mind.  I forgot the 1-15.  Yeah.  How quick can we forget?  The Cowboys have won the 15 the year before.  I was like, forget the 1-15.  We're going to win some games.  Wow. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  And Jimmy Johnson is such an amazing...  I mean, the Herschel Walker trade was amazing because it brought in so many amazing players.  I should say amazing again, maybe.  Boy, I am.  But did you find that when Jimmy Johnson, I mean, you guys won in 92, 93.  Right.  And then in 94, I think...  Was Jimmy there in 94?  No.  He left, right?  Right.  And how much did that hurt the team, the feud between him and Jerry Jones?  If he had stayed, where do you think you guys might have been?  Well, there's no telling where we might have been.  I mean, we could have been ran into the ground because the way Jimmy devised practices, we 
[02:58:30]  were actually beating each other up.  So when Barry Switzer got there, Barry Switzer inherited a very veteran team, a very good  veteran team, very, very good.  And so he devised practices in a different way.  We didn't have to beat each other up, but all we had to do was be more cerebral about  what we were doing.  We had to go through the practices full speed and all those kind of things, but it was more  mental and less physical. 
[02:59:00]  And so once we got into the football field, we was ready to rock and roll.  I think the problem was, in 94, is that we were all still stunned by the fact that our  guy that just won two Super Bowls with was no longer with us.  And it just didn't make sense.  You couldn't put a rhyme or reason in why.  You would think that Jerry fired him and you would say that Jimmy quit.  And if you talk to Jimmy, Jimmy would tell you straight up, well, this is what he told  me and I'm telling personal information. 
[02:59:30]  He's like, E, I was burnt out.  I needed a break.  You know, I got sick and tired of being the bad guy.  Someone got in trouble.  They came to me.  I had to police everything.  And so I got tired of that and I needed a break.  And so technically he was leaving anyway.  So.  You know, one of my favorite Emmitt, I don't go to many games, but I got a ticket to the  Giants.  I think you guys were both, you were both 11 and four Giants in Dallas.  I want to say it was 94 and.  You can.  Yes.  Even though it's probably 1967.  It was Don Meredith. 
[03:00:00]  But I think it was 90, 94 and it was the final.  Whoever won the game won the division.  That was 93.  It was 93.  92, 93.  Okay.  And it was, it was 13 nothing Dallas at the half, I think.  And then Rodney Hampton had a great second half and it wound up being, or were you guys  losing?  But I think you had like 163 yards.  You had one of the best games I'd ever seen you have.  I think we were winning at the half and the Giants, I ended up hurting my shoulder.  That's the game I hurt my shoulder in.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the game I hurt my shoulder in.  And the Giants came back and, and, and tied it up. 
[03:00:30]  They played very good in the second half and we ended up going into overtime.  I remember because I was, I was driving home.  I had a gig that I had an eight o'clock gig that night at Rascals.  And I told my girlfriend, like, look, if it goes into overtime, we have to leave.  Never thinking it would go into overtime.  So I'm leaving the parking lot of Giants stadium and you've never left Giants stadium faster.  And I hear the guy on the radio go, no one has left the building as I'm driving with  my psychotic girlfriend down the Jersey turnpike.  And then I think Eddie Murray kicked a field goal and won it.  Wow.  Jimmy's got a hell of a memory.  For those things I do. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But as far as an anniversary or birthday.  What else have you learned within the book?  Well, I was surprised.  I didn't know that you were such a spiritual guy.  Like I had no idea that you were, you know, cause you never know players when you watch  them play.  Right.  Well, you don't see that side.  Right.  What most people miss is that internally when, when the guys come in and they have every  player that I know of, every African American player, most of them anyway, have some form  of scripture with them, some form.  And internally they may say certain prayers to themselves and so forth and on and on. 
[03:01:30]  And then the whole team itself comes together right before we all leave and we say the Lord's  prayer.  I mean, we'll say a prayer and, and then we'll go out and we, and we go, go to battle.  Cause every guy that walks out of that locker room knows, knows in their back of their mind,  this could be the last time I played a game of football.  I need some spiritual help.  I need some sanity.  I need something to be with me.  And, and, and when you talk about football, players talk about football from a mind, body  and soul standpoint.  Well, what is the soul? 
[03:02:00]  That's your spirituality.  And so it's all intertwined.  And, and, uh, I play with a lot of intention, intensity and a lot of passion and, and I  play with my spirit too.  So you don't see warriors going to battle without a warrior cry.  It's a spiritual cry.  What were you thinking right before it was against the Seahawks that, uh, you got, you  broke Walter Payton's record and in the run that you, that led up to it, like right  as the play, as you know, you're going to get the ball.  Are you thinking I'm going to break it this time?  And what's going through your mind as, as you're about to take that run at that time? 
[03:02:30]  Um, I, I really don't know outside of, I got to get positive yardage.  I'm thinking, and I'm thinking within the game itself, I got to get positive yardage.  If they give me the ball, I see a runner lane, I'm going to hit it as hard as I can.  I'm not even thinking about the record, but I knew I was close because I could hear the,  the announcer, uh, counting down.  So I could feel the energy.  I could feel the energy within the crowd.  Sure.  And so once I broke it, it was like, Whoa.  And I was like, what am I going to do now? 
[03:03:00]  I mean, and they actually paused the game and I'm like, well, what do I do?  What do you want me to do?  I mean, like I broke the record.  So what do you want me to do?  So are they like, take a bow, go over and do this and all this other, these other things.  And I'm like saying to myself, I've never seen that happen.  I never, never had it happen to me before in a game where the game itself paused.  What a moment.  And, and I got a chance to go hug my mom and my family members.  But before I got back in the football game, I'm thinking I'm going to get a penalty for 
[03:03:30]  being late.  I'm thinking about the 45 second clock and all those kinds of things.  And then all of a sudden I'm like, I get like two minutes.  How embarrassing would it be if you just fumbled the rest of the game?  We took negative yards and they had to take the record back.  Oh boy.  That really would have been bad.  Well, man, what, uh, now, uh, you said, what am I going to do next?  That's kind of a big thing with football players.  When you retire and you're done, what are you thinking?  Are you thinking, especially when you've had a great career like that, you know? 
[03:04:00]  Well, for me, um, uh, as you were seeing my book, I've always had this vision of, of  football being a priority, but along the line, you always, I've had people say to me, uh,  don't put all your eggs in one basket, prepare for life after the game.  And what does that whole life leads up to that?  Like your whole life led up to you playing football.  Right.  And then when that's over, my life led to another moment.  Okay.  What do I do from here?  Uh, and having a vision in terms of where you want to go, uh, knowing that this is going 
[03:04:30]  to end, find something that will not end.  And what I've done, I've exercised my entrepreneurial spirit just for men, just for men is a commercial  that I still use.  I mean, I exercise my entrepreneurial spirit.  So I started my own businesses.  I talked to Roger Staubach.  I talked to, I talked to Irvin Johnson, talked to Michael, uh, uh, Michael Jordan.  Uh, I talked to a lot of different people about business itself. 
[03:05:00]  I read, I was raised in Jerry's house.  So Jerry taught me a lot.  And so getting into the real estate development business is something that I chose to do.  Also starting my own construction company is something that I chose to do because  business itself happens every day, every year, forever.  Yeah.  If that stops, then there's a bigger problem.  Forever.  It never stops.  Yeah.  And so what I'm trying to do right now with my companies is put together the best teams,  obviously, and go out there and produce the best product that we possibly can for whatever 
[03:05:30]  client we're working for.  Yeah.  But it's amazing too.  And you look at like, you know, guys like Staubach and Elway and Jordan who've gone on  to so many other things.  Right.  But then you look at a guy like Nate Newton and it's like,  what happens to some guys where after football, there's obviously they have a good amount  of money and they just, they can't figure it out.  They just can't figure it out or they make the wrong decisions.  Well, well, think about it.  You said it.  My whole life was geared towards getting to that point.  Right.  Then all of a sudden I have to learn an entire new trade. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  All over again, regardless of how much money I have or how much money I saved, I have to  spend that money to some way, in some way, shape or form in order to start a new business.  Right.  And it's brand new.  So I got to really, really work very, very hard to try and figure out who to hire, how  to hire them and how to set up these processes and procedures within your company.  Develop the business plan within itself before you even get to the hiring part. 
[03:06:30]  Because you haven't had that experience playing football, no.  You haven't had that experience playing that football.  Mm-mm.  Not at all.  So it all becomes new and it can be very intimidating and very frightening, let alone very expensive.  It's an expensive lesson to learn when you don't do it the right way.  Yeah, that's got to be a little nerve wracking when you're taking a big chunk of that that  you worked so hard for and going, I hope this works.  No, it better work.  It has to work.  It better work.  You got to make it work.  You have to make it work.  You fall into the category of real, everyday people. 
[03:07:00]  Mm-mm.  How about that?  Yeah, yeah.  Being a very religious man, can you explain one thing to me?  What's that, sir?  The whole thank God thing.  When you thank God after a good game.  Right.  With players in general, yeah.  Yeah, players in general.  Because then the other side of the field, those guys are doing the God thing.  They're thanking God, too.  And God wasn't looking out for them that day.  It's not about the win or the loss.  It's about coming off the football field or the boxing ring healthy.  Thank God.  So they're not thanking God for the actual win.  It's not about the win.  It's not about the win.  You just explained it. 
[03:07:30]  Ah, you got me out of here.  Now that makes sense.  It's not about the win.  You just explained it.  Yeah, it's about it.  Because I always thought, well, the guys on the losing team, they're believing in God  just as much as the winning team is.  See, you're looking at it from a win-loss standpoint.  I'm looking at it from a standpoint of, man, thank you, Jesus, I made it off the football field.  I walked off under my own power.  I walked off under my own power.  I'll be honest.  I thought I had you.  Yeah.  I thought I had you.  You know what it is?  Because non-athletes, guys like that, don't really understand what we mean when we say  stuff like that.  We, we, we.  I thought I had you say winning.  But I actually never understood that either, and that makes sense. 
[03:08:00]  It always confused me.  I'm like, well, the losing team have a lot of believers, too.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody, I mean, both sides have a lot of believers, but at the end of the day, it's  really about being thankful that you were able to come off the football field healthy,  and if you want to say win, yes.  Right.  Because it could have went the other way, too.  What could, what could people get from your book as far as sports or business?  It's not necessarily all about sports.  Obviously, yeah.  It's about inspiring people to not only find, see, I believe everybody have a degree or a 
[03:08:30]  certain level of talent within ourselves.  Except E.  No, yeah.  If you saw some of our staff, you would change it.  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of them.  Everybody, everybody has it.  Trust me.  Whatever it may be, it's a talent level.  And with that said, you have to figure out what it is that you're trying to get in life,  how you want to get it, and develop a plan to make it happen.  And then you have to develop some of the things that we use in football.  You have to develop the mental toughness, the perseverance, the courage, the self-esteem, 
[03:09:00]  the will to want it to make it happen.  Build your team.  Yeah, you got to build your team.  You got to build your team.  You got to do all of those fundamental things in order to get to that place.  Right, right.  And that's what this book is all about.  And I take some spiritual lessons and words and verses and apply in areas where it fits.  And real-life applications.  Yeah, yeah.  Because a lot of times spiritual stuff is a little too, you know, cosmic for people to 
[03:09:30]  really put into real-life application.  But if you can do that.  I like spiritual stuff.  Yeah, I like it.  Hey, Emmitt, football question.  Who's the best football player today?  Most talented.  Doesn't matter about wins and all that.  Most talented?  Yeah.  Who's up there?  Who's your top five playing right now?  Most talented?  Wow.  Who's your top five?  Because there's so much great talent on the football field.  It's unbelievable.  But five guys where you're like, oh my goodness. 
[03:10:00]  It's kind of hard to say the most talented because all of them are talented.  But everyone is executing their job or their position at a high level.  And when I look at it from that perspective, I'm going to break it down from a quarterback  standpoint.  Fair enough.  I'm going to go to Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, by far head and shoulders above the rest.  Sanchez third.  Not even third.  He's a Jets fan.  He's trying to throw Sanchez in.  He's trying to throw Sanchez in.  He's on the top 30. 
[03:10:30]  I'm going to go right there.  He's going to have a good year, sir.  Well, good luck.  Good luck until Sunday night.  That's right.  But I'm going to go with those two guys.  Then when you start breaking it down from a running back perspective, I'm going to go  to, obviously, Adrian Peterson is one of those guys.  Chris Johnson is another.  And I think Michael Turner is the third one.  So after that, everybody doesn't get in line.  When you go to wide receivers, Larry Fitzgerald.  Wow. 
[03:11:00]  Santana, your homes.  Santana homes.  That's a good list.  That's a good list.  I mean, I think our kid down in Dallas is going to be okay.  If he can stay out of trouble, stay out of getting kicked out of the Old Small.  You still have a passion for the game as far as watching it?  Do you get excited watching the Cowboys play?  I get excited watching the Cowboys play. 
[03:11:30]  I really love college football.  I love watching college football more than I like watching the football.  Wow, really?  Yeah, I really do.  I've always been a big fan of college football.  I think it's much more an exciting game when you watch the young people play.  Do you think it's because they all want that next step?  They're not there yet?  I think it's probably a combination of both.  It's probably a combination of both.  Speaking of that, because you like college football, Tebow.  Why won't he be a great NFL quarterback?  I don't understand this one. 
[03:12:00]  He was an amazing college football quarterback, obviously.  Well, the pro level is a different game.  It truly is a different game.  What doesn't he have?  Maybe the velocity on his arm may not be there.  Obviously, coming out of a spread offense and getting into a pro-style offense requires a different type of reading pattern  in terms of reading the defenses and coverages.  I think he has the leadership quality.  And he's got God on his side. 
[03:12:30]  He definitely has God on his side.  Sure does.  But, I mean, God is nothing to joke about.  For real.  He's not.  And with Tim Tebow, I think he has that it thing.  I just don't know if his talent-wise or his arm strength-wise or the ability to evolve to a pro-style kind of quarterback is there.  Merrill Hawes did a great, great analysis of Tim Tebow a couple weeks ago.  And I was very impressed in terms of how he described it. 
[03:13:00]  But I loved Tim Tebow as a person.  And I think, as a football player, he's a tough guy.  He's great for the Broncos.  Bring great leadership qualities.  Some of the things that some talented quarterbacks don't have.  Sanchez.  Sanchez.  He's a shot at me, I think.  He's Sanchez.  And Sanchez has God on his side.  He does.  But let's be honest.  Alvin Harper is who everybody's talking about.  I know a lot of people don't remember Alvin Harper being second wide receiver on Dallas.  Man, you went so far back. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, man.  But the 94 loss always hurt me.  Because they lost to San Francisco 31-21 in the championship game.  And I think Dallas was better that year.  What is he doing?  Because I remember that was a horrible loss.  And I think it was big.  Do you think it's because that he outcoached Switzer a little bit because he put Dion on Alvin Harper, who was the 49er killer.  And he didn't put him on Michael Irvin like they thought he would.  Jeez.  Look at you.  That's been bothering me for 20 years, 17 years.  I'm going to take the blame for that one.  I think that was the year my hamstrings was bothering me. 
[03:14:00]  Was it your fault?  You didn't miss the field goal before halftime?  No, I didn't do that.  No, you didn't.  Do you know that?  Did he write that down just for today?  I'm amazed.  No, I did not.  No, I believe Linnelli missed the field goal.  That's amazing.  You know that.  I remember very few things, but that wasn't your fault.  I think you did fumble, but it's not even worth getting into.  It was very slippery.  I don't know if I did or not, but my hammies kept acting up that year.  It was very rainy weather.  It was really awful.  Yeah.  We've got to wrap up, unfortunately.  Oh, yeah.  We have to wrap up.  Wow, look at the time.  Wow.  We're all saying yes. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, wow.  The book is called Game On.  Find Your Purpose.  Pursue Your Dream.  Emmett Smith, it's out now.  Obviously, Emmett Smith is very inspirational.  It's how to pursue your dreams.  Do what you want to do.  Are you signing anywhere?  I know you signed last night.  Yes, I did.  Are you signing anywhere that you know coming up?  I'm going to be in Jacksonville and Gainesville this weekend.  I think I'm done signing up in this area right now.  It's hard with a lot of the bookstores closing to actually get books into places because there's  so many places that used to have... 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, it's tough these days.  Although you could probably sign wherever you want.  Athletes do very well at bookstores.  Did you have a lot of nice turnout last night?  Oh, yeah.  So completely out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was kind of crazy.  That's awesome.  With the rain and everything.  They must have ordered too many of my books because I didn't sell out when people went.  All right, but I'm happy for Emmett.  That's all that matters.  I'm sorry that didn't happen for you.  I'm sorry.  I'm happy for you.  One of my favorite people, Emmett Smith.  You can get the book.  I guess you can order it online, too, if you can't get to a bookstore.  I'm sure you can.  Where you can digitally download it.  It's available and it's out now. 
[03:15:30]  Game on.  And what else to say?  Yeah, Emmett, thanks so much, man.  All right, guys.  Y'all be good.  Thank you.  Take care.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's right.  And look who's everybody still here.  Not everybody, Sam.  Well, Ant's gone.  Ant fled.  I like how Jimmy pushed, literally, walked over Sammy Sweetheart's beautiful face just 
[03:16:00]  to get to Emmett Smith.  I didn't mean to, like, I felt bad about that because she was actually really nice.  We weren't sure if she'd be a fun interview.  Yeah.  She was cool.  She was very pleasant.  And she could have stayed, but I didn't even get a picture with her.  Like, I get a picture with her.  But when Emmett came in, to me, it was like, you know, I'll never have a chance again to  talk to Emmett Smith.  Right.  He turned out to be really good.  Oh, yeah.  He was a really nice guy.  Isn't that what you say every time, though?  Well, we make a lot of jokes, and we're assholes, and then, you know, these guys turn us around.  I thought Emmett Smith would be a bore.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I know he's a great, great running back and all that. 
[03:16:30]  The greatest.  But I wasn't sure how he was going to be on the show, and it turned out he was all right,  man.  If Jimmy still wants to...  I think we all learned a little something from Emmett Smith.  We all need a little God in our lives.  That's right.  I'm a big God guy.  Eric?  If Jimmy still wants to get a photo with Sammy, she's at Hits 1.  You still want a photo?  She'll be done soon.  Oh, I'd like one, yeah.  Yeah, we should get photos with Sammy Sweetheart.  Jimmy, your butt crack is prominently displayed as you bend over.  I know.  That was something nice for us.  Why would you put an end to that?  I can't wait to get a picture with Sammy.  I didn't mean to push her out, though. 
[03:17:00]  I really...  I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I mean, I liked her a lot.  She was nice.  It was the greatest push-out ever.  Yeah.  But fucking Emmett Smith...  You basically, like, walked over her face.  She was like, you're like, what?  You want to scooch over?  You basically told her to go wherever you want.  Just don't sit in that chair.  Yeah.  Don't say anything.  I'm going to sit next to Emmett Smith.  Don't say anything.  Yeah.  I love Emmett Smith.  Are you going to get her into the discussion with Emmett?  No.  I might have...  No.  I wouldn't have.  I would have done...  By the way, we missed Triple H.  He came in as we ended the show, even though we're still doing the show. 
[03:17:30]  If she would have talked while Emmett was talking, I would have said, honey, please.  Right, right, right.  Emmett, go.  Triple H said happy birthday to me, for the record.  He said happy birthday, Jimmy.  He doesn't know he's...  I told him it was your birthday.  Well, obviously...  Was it your birthday yesterday?  Yeah, but he wasn't here yesterday.  Was he going to call me?  Triple H, I'm...  I'm kind of bummed we didn't get him on the show.  Now he's talking to some lame-ass show that no one listens to instead of us.  I don't know what happens.  He should be here now.  All right, I'm going to go...  Where are you going? 
[03:18:00]  Home.  I got therapy today.  I go home with you.  Yeah, no.  I'm going to try to get a picture with Sammy, and...  You should.  I feel bad that I...  Trish her.  I fucking love Emmett Smith, though.  But she wasn't put out.  I hope not.  She was very nice.  Yeah, she cut liners.  Did you look up those stats, or you just know that from your head?  I knew that from my head.  I didn't remember the right year.  I was off the right year.  I was off...  I didn't know if it was 94 or 93 that he had that game.  Right, but the details.  Holy shit.  I remember those.  Yeah, no.  The questions I wrote...  And I do forget that the Cowboys were 1-15 the year before Emmett Smith.  I forgot that, too.  I forgot that.  But then they were 3-13 at one point. 
[03:18:30]  It might have been two years ago or that year.  They went 1-15, 3-13, I think.  But I wrote a bunch of questions, which I didn't even get to, but I didn't mention any stats.  That's the mark of a good interview.  Not getting to all your questions.  That means you were going with the conversation.  That's a good way to do things.  Yeah, I should have asked him when they were 0-2 and he was holding out.  And Charles Haley was screaming, we can't win with a rookie running back.  And then Emmett got signed for game three.  And they wound up winning all those games in a row.  How many in a row?  Information to me.  They had lost two. 
[03:19:00]  They went...  They lost two in the middle of the year.  That's the year that they lost to the fucking Dolphins on Thanksgiving when Leon Lett kicked the football and they got to kick over.  And they lost back-to-back games.  They lost like two games.  They were fucking...  They won eight straight.  They were 0-2, then 8-2, then fucking 8-4, and then they were 12-4.  Wow.  I remember that.  They love eating the numbers.  I wanted to talk about Leon Lett with Emmett Smith.  I would love to.  Because you know those stories.  The big cat, fucking number 78.  Where he would destroy his own car with chewing tobacco.  No, that's Larry Allen. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, Larry Allen.  Offensive lineman, yeah.  Fuck, thank God I didn't bring it up.  Larry Allen used to fuck up his BMW.  Yeah, in his Benz by spitting fucking tobacco juice in it.  Yeah.  He would just spit his tobacco juice in the passenger side.  You know how we all put our fast food wrappers there?  Yeah, he would put his fucking tobacco spit.  No cop.  Ruining a really nice Mercedes.  What a fucking offensive lineman, though.  He was, I think...  What is he doing now?  I don't know.  I think he was actually in that 94 game where they lost to the fucking Niners, and he was  a rookie then.  He was hurt, if I remember right.  And Larry Allen doesn't know what he's doing now.  Bad car accident.  You should get him on the show.  All right, guys. 
[03:20:00]  I'm just babbling about the cowboy stats.  I know.  I don't know what you're doing anymore.  What are you talking about?  This is good radio, Sam.  I don't even know what you guys are talking about.  Well, you don't like football?  No, I don't like football.  He likes men in tights.  You do like men in tights?  As opposed to what?  Men in tight pants?  What are they wearing football?  By the way, Sam, people are right.  There is a glimpse of the famous Hannibal mustache.  Is there a glimpse in the video?  In the Sam birthday videos.  Yeah.  And I will tell you this.  This whole mocking Sam Roberts thing may be backfiring, because I was getting Twitter 
[03:20:30]  messages from people saying thank you for making it okay for me to be 23, 25, whatever  age it might be, and still collect action figures.  No, no, no.  It's a hobby.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  If you're going to say it properly, that it's okay for a 23-year-old man to still be  playing with toys.  Nobody plays with them.  And dolls.  They're not there to be played with.  See, they're not helping you out by trying to say they're action figures.  It would have been cool if they stepped up and said, yeah, Sam made it cool for me 
[03:21:00]  at 23 to also be playing with dolls.  Nobody plays with them.  And toys.  The condition of my collection.  When you say action figures, that means they're in denial like yourself.  It's not denial.  You're in denial.  You play with dolls.  You know who calls them dolls?  Guys that don't understand.  Bullies.  Am I a bully now?  Yes, you're a bully.  Are you crazy?  Yes, you're a bully.  How am I a bully?  Because you came to my house for no reason that I can think of.  Right.  You videotaped me opening birthday presents around my family. 
[03:21:30]  Which is up on the Opie and Anthony Facebook.  I made fun of it.  And then you mocked it.  Because everyone else was mocking it.  I just put it on film for everybody.  No, nobody was mocking it.  Just you.  Everybody was.  And nobody said dolls.  And you almost stabbed me with that knife.  Well, yeah, I did.  You should be a star, not a bully.  Okay?  I'm a star.  And I'm not a bully.  No, you're a bully.  I'm a star.  I'm a star.  I'm in the be a star campaign.  What?  Anti-bullying.  I took the R word pledge.  Did it not say on the toy for children six and up? 
[03:22:00]  Six and up.  Children.  For children six and up.  Yeah, but they're not going to say for children six and up and then adults past that.  That's a given.  You guys are all in denial by calling them action figures.  Call them what they are.  It's fine.  You're 28 and you like playing with toys still.  You go to a store.  Toys and dolls.  You go to a store.  And they know you're all creeps because what I learned in that fucking video.  Yeah.  Which proved I don't have knowledge about this world.  That's right.  That they now paint the clothes on.  Why do you think they paint the clothes on these toys? 
[03:22:30]  Because it's less expensive.  Because of freaks like you pulling the clothes off in the middle of the night in your bed.  It's a cost issue.  And they realize, you know what?  This is too creepy.  We got grown men like Sam Roberts playing with toys and dolls.  So now we got to paint the clothes on them so these pervs don't fucking rip the little fucking kid clothes off these things.  I was listening to a podcast yesterday.  And you know who collected action figures into his 20s and still does to this day?  Dolls?  WWE superstar Zack Ryder who also wished me a happy birthday on Twitter. 
[03:23:00]  Woo woo woo.  But he's in the business.  You know it.  He's in the business.  But he did it before he was in the business.  So I would understand that he's collecting the toys and the dolls because he works for the company.  He did it before he worked for them.  Yeah, when he was probably 8, 9, 10.  No, I don't think so.  Well, he did because he told me on the podcast.  No, I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  I don't believe it.  Are you serious, bro?  Really think about the fucking dolls and why they have to paint the clothes on it.  That's creepy.  Because it's a cost issue.  Why don't they just have it as removable clothes? 
[03:23:30]  Because it costs more money to make.  I don't think so.  It does.  Yes, it does.  Then why do the elbow pads come off?  Because they want to have something cool in there.  Because no one gets sexually turned on by elbows.  So it's like, yeah, let the elbow pads, let them be removable.  There are people who do.  But the little tiny little wrestling shorts, they want to make sure those fucking things  are painted on now because they don't want creeps like you pulling down the fucking  little wrestling tights to see what the little dolls got going on underneath.  People get turned on by elbows.  No, they don't.  Some do.  No, they don't.  You don't know everybody.  People get turned on by elbows. 
[03:24:00]  Not elbows.  By, you just tricked me there.  By armpits.  But not elbows.  Some elbows.  What's the...  Armpits?  Axolism, it's called.  Sammy Sweetheart just walked by.  Have you ever had sex with a...  With an elbow?  No, with a fucking armpit.  With an armpit.  No.  Have you?  No.  Well...  That's creepy.  I'm not creepy.  But I know people are doing it.  Sammy Sweetheart just walked by.  I don't know.  She's waiting in the hallway.  I feel like we should get her in here to ask her if she has ever been turned on or known  someone who has been turned on by an elbow.  You could do that. 
[03:24:30]  I know.  That's the type of show I run.  Grab the wireless and go out.  We don't have a wireless.  I hope you know the Heimlich because I think I'm choking.  If you're choking, I'm looking at that chair.  Oh.  Thank God.  Thank God these blueberries are very tiny.  How come you can shove your face full of blueberries on this show but not your show?  Because people don't like hearing us eat on our show.  Yeah, but then why would you bring that here?  Because this is the shit hour.  No, it's not.  Everyone calls it that.  Just stupid Bobo and he's dumb. 
[03:25:00]  He's very dumb.  And banned, right?  I can't hear you, Rock.  I'm sorry.  Is Bobo banned?  Is a contest going to happen?  I don't give a fuck about Bobo and that dumb fucking hooker contest.  Now listen to me.  All right.  Elbow pads.  Removable.  Yeah.  The little wrestling shorts painted on.  Cost.  Think about it.  Cost effective.  Even the company that makes the dolls for you grown men know that it's a little creepy.  My towel makes action figures.  They know it's a little creepy.  You go to a store.  They know it's a little creepy. 
[03:25:30]  You go to a store and above an aisle it says action figures.  It says dolls.  I go down the aisle it says action figures and purchase my goods.  Because they realize that they would sell more by calling them action figures but they know.  They know they're toys.  They know they're dolls.  They're toys.  It says six and up on the packaging.  I mean you buy them at Toys R Us.  Six and up.  Toys.  Guess what Sam?  When an adult buys something it doesn't say hey this is made for men 28 and up.  That's because they've lost touch with their inner child.  Think about it. 
[03:26:00]  Think about it.  I just did.  When you're an adult you can buy whatever you want and they don't put an age range on it at all.  Really?  So they don't check your ID when you buy alcohol?  Face.  That's alcohol.  You dope.  Okay fine.  Let's do cigarettes then.  I'm talking about toys.  Toys.  Okay fine.  Lotto tickets.  Toys.  Face.  Toys.  What about rum rice and ice cream?  Face.  Toys.  Toys.  Rent a car.  Toys.  Rent a car.  That's an adult toy right?  How old do you have to be?  Is E-Roc trying to help you?  No.  25 and up.  Is it?  Face.  That's not a face.  I just destroyed you. 
[03:26:30]  You know I'm right.  Elbow pads removable because elbows are not a turn on.  No.  The wrestling shorts, the tiny little wrestling shorts are painted on.  Because the elbow pads are made of hard plastic.  End of argument.  End of argument.  It's not a strong argument.  You can discuss it on my YouTube page.  Under the comments.  What about your Twitter page?  What if you started a discussion on Facebook?  Let me tell you something about Twitter.  Fuck Fred from Brooklyn.  He started this.  I saw him over the weekend.  He started this.  Let's beat Al Roker to 100,000. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Since he started the big OP radio on Twitter versus Al Roker to 100,000 thing.  I'm getting no followers.  Well what's he good for then?  He has no fucking justice Fred from Brooklyn.  You thought he had Poe.  I actually lost followers for the first time in a year.  Oh man.  You got to watch who has your back sometimes.  I know he meant well but he doesn't have the juice to pull it off.  Yeah.  Especially if it's costing you.  I think I got four new followers yesterday when I needed them most.  Did you notice I launched past 25,000? 
[03:27:30]  Oh.  Me.  Congratulations.  You're walking out?  It's rude.  I got all my plugs in.  OP radio on Twitter.  Facebook OP radio fans.  OP radio on YouTube.  You got an Instagram?  I do Google Plus I think.  No he doesn't Google Plus anymore.  Yeah I know.  I'm just kind of letting it sit there.  It's Audi 5000.  Audi 5000.  But you don't do Instagram.  Sammy Sweetheart.  Invite her in.  This mic does sound different Opie.  What?  This mic sounds different than Ant's mic. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah I know.  This is a conspiracy.  I think you're right now.  No there's a conspiracy.  There's no processing on my mic.  Well you know who's out to get you.  The company.  I get it.  I'll leave soon and let them do what they want.  It's fine.  The answer is Marcelino.  Mars.  Mars?  Mars.  He's the one who programmed this.  The mics do not sound the same.  I would go so far as to say this one sounds a bit tinny.  Who locked me in?  Yes.  You locked me in E?  No I've been sitting here.  He said no I've been sitting here. 
[03:28:30]  I mean.  It opens now.  You just didn't have the arm strength before.  You weren't locked in at all.  Stanley T.  By the way.  I don't do radio with Stanley T.  Stan bought me lunch yesterday.  He just said I don't do radio with Stanley T.  And walked out.  Oh why you say that man?  What did I do O?  What did I do?  You didn't pause this shit.  I didn't say that.  What did I do?  He said it.  You know I've told him that.  What did I do O?  I've told you that Opie doesn't like the mash up on the after show.  I told you Opie doesn't like the mash up right? 
[03:29:00]  Opie's my man.  So is Jim.  It's the other guy.  Where's that motherfucker at?  Anthony.  He's gone.  Don't let black people talk on his mic.  No he doesn't like it so much.  I don't know man.  You guys do.  But I did like Eric.  I don't know if you were there that day.  But Stanley T.  Is in here now from the after show.  Yeah.  And yes.  To you on instant feedback.  I did bro Opie.  Are you serious bro?  You did?  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm rubbing off on you.  Stanley T.  From the morning mash up.  Is in here right now.  I know Opie has said multiple times.  That he doesn't really like the mash up on this show. 
[03:29:30]  Really?  But what he said.  Incremental doses.  Said small portions.  Alright.  Not long form.  He doesn't like it.  I understand.  So I'm watching my watch right now.  I mean look.  So I'll leave.  I understand.  I would keep you.  But look at the name on the wall.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  How much power do I really have?  But Stan.  Went to.  And that's the way I was asking.  I don't know if you saw this that day.  Stan.  Was in the morning mash up office one day.  Mmhmm.  And he's been on the after show before.  Has Stanley T.  Sure.  And that was the day that Opie told him. 
[03:30:00]  He couldn't use Anthony's microphone because.  Oh.  Hotline Stan.  We gotta pick up the hotline when it rings.  Alright.  Go ahead.  Hello.  You know.  Where the fuck did I get this rap that Stanley T.  Says I don't let black people use my microphone.  Because he confronted you.  Did I ever.  Did I ever fucking say that to anyone?  Or was it some other motherfucker that was in there that said it?  Who actually said that?  Sam.  No.  I didn't.  Wait.  Sam said it.  And then Opie backed him up.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Opie said it.  And then I backed Opie up.  He's the boss ant.  You understand. 
[03:30:30]  No.  Regardless.  Did I ever fucking say it?  And then.  But.  Here's the deal.  No.  You've never said it to me.  Stanley T.  He looks at me like I'm.  Like he motherfuckers me when I walk.  He does.  He absolutely really thinks I don't let black people use my fucking microphone.  So can we do this ceremoniously?  And can we have Stanley T.  Say thank you on your microphone?  He could absolutely use my microphone.  I don't care.  All right.  I'm going to your mic right now.  Hold on.  But it.  Yeah.  Thank you Anthony.  There it is.  Thank you Anthony.  I appreciate that.  This is like the Rainbow Coalition. 
[03:31:00]  You know.  Because I went on straight from watching your gunshot bullshit that you do.  So now I'm going to start watching again.  You's a crazy motherfucker.  You know that.  Well I know I'm crazy.  But that would really be crazy to not let black people use my microphone.  Yeah he's not.  He's not that insane.  Ant's racism is like charming.  There's charm.  Selective.  Yeah.  Very selective.  It's like Ant is racist in a general sense.  Yeah.  But when it comes to one on one.  Like I went to Ant's house over the weekend for his big Labor Day party.  Right. 
[03:31:30]  And Patrice O'Neill.  The biggest blackest guy you could ever meet.  Yeah.  Was right there having fun with everybody else.  All right.  So it's just a misunderstanding.  Right Ant?  It absolutely was.  No more.  No more.  Give me the eye in the hallway.  Okay.  I won't give you the eye in the hallway.  All right.  Thank you.  See you later man.  Thank you Ant.  So there you go Stanley T.  I'm glad we solved that because.  Thank you for solving it.  Because I was giving him the eye.  Well you were doing more than giving him the eye.  Ant was in one of his meetings weeks ago.  And he walked by the mashup office.  And I was in there conducting some hits one business as I tend to do.  And he walked by and waved in. 
[03:32:00]  And Stan got up out of his chair and got right in his face and said.  What's this bullshit I hear about you not letting black people on your microphone?  I did.  I did.  You're not shy.  I take the bull by the horns.  I just confront the issue head on.  But you know what?  Stan you're not shyness is the same thing that convinced Don Cheadle to come in this studio  the time that he did.  Oh I love that.  If I remember you put your arm around him.  You got to come in here.  You got to talk to my boys.  That's right.  That's right.  Because the ONA is my boys.  You know I love the entire show. 
[03:32:30]  Shouts out to E-Rock.  Where the fuck is E-Rock?  There he is.  He's running shit.  What's up man?  You put on that Vaseline like I told you?  That I did.  Did you?  Jesus.  And it made a lot of progress.  You're right.  This is getting very weird in here.  This is getting very strange.  Did you see his face?  I'm not.  I don't know if you're talking about his face.  No comment.  I don't know what you're talking about.  But thank you for stopping by.  Later.  And he ends on a strong note.  Stanley T everybody.  What an action packed.  That's just between me and him.  Don't worry about that.  Yeah.  I'm not going to ask any questions.  What an action packed beginning of the after show.  I got to get my little piece of paper here.  I didn't even have time to do everything. 
[03:33:00]  Inside note.  Maybe under 20.  We're seeing.  We're working on Operation Secret.  Yeah.  Well look.  We both know what show a certain person is doing today.  Let's push it back.  Alright.  Well I tried.  But they jumped in right away.  So they're there with him.  Already?  They were hounding the show that was on before them.  Well here's what you do.  You go in there and start giving them the wrap up signs. 
[03:33:30]  As if you're somebody.  I'm going to go in.  You know what I'll do?  I'll put stone cold music on my phone and turn it on speaker.  Kick the door open with the music.  Just burn it.  By the way.  We were very secretive yesterday at the end of the after show.  Was the guest that you were trying to get indeed a phone call from WWE superstar Zack Ryder?  Woo woo woo.  You know it.  That would have been fabulous.  I was very excited to get a tweet.  But they were trying but he had to they couldn't change his flight. 
[03:34:00]  He's a busy guy you know.  He can't just be at everybody's beck and call.  But he did.  Long Island IZ himself tweeted me just last night to say happy birthday.  So I would like to say a big thank you to him.  I'll have to see.  And everybody who was involved.  I'll have to see if we get him in because you know he's from Long Island.  If we get him in not only will he do this show.  What do you mean of course he would.  But will he also tape one of his own shows while doing this?  He should. 
[03:34:30]  I mean if anybody should be.  But Zack Ryder for those that don't know is a WWE wrestler who his gimmick is that he's like a Long Island guy.  And he spikes his hair and he goes to clubs.  That's his whole thing.  And it's great.  And he has a YouTube show called Z True Hollywood Story.  So you should look at his YouTube show if you haven't had a chance yet because it's ridiculous.  And I mean you don't have to be a wrestling fan to like the Z True Hollywood Story at Long Island IZ.  But like you don't think I could be broski of the week? 
[03:35:00]  I definitely think you would be.  I would think so.  I mean that's.  How could you not?  But you have to dress the part.  I would.  Take care of Spike your hair.  Glasses, shirt, everything.  Headband.  We got to increase the visibility of this show to start really like.  Because you know I mean there's a lot of great shows around here but not every.  Like this is still a show on the virus that a lot of people listen to.  I'll see if we can get into the next promotional brochure.  We should get into the next promotional brochure.  As a matter of fact the goal of this show is to have my face in the brochure before we get Opie and Anthony's face in the brochure. 
[03:35:30]  Alright.  I think it's doable.  I think it's doable.  But we have to all work together.  Roland.  What's up buddy?  Hang on.  What did you say?  I forgot to get the Sammy Sweetheart stuff sign.  What?  Is she gone?  No.  She's still next door.  Okay good.  Because I put my DVD on your desk.  I got everybody else's signature on it. 
[03:36:00]  What time did she leave?  Oh it's.  Oh no.  What time did she leave?  It's on your desk.  I put it on Roland's desk.  Oh.  Because he has his stuff up here.  Well I put it on Roland's desk with all the other stuff.  I hope you guys didn't get a dick in the ass buddies.  Oh no.  I hate dicks in the ass.  You know that Roland.  Now you almost got a dick in the ass today.  Did you hear what they were saying about some of our guests before they came in?  Yeah.  Drives you insane doesn't it?  Did you see me?  No.  Exactly.  I was just I hid in the corner. 
[03:36:30]  Why are you guys doing this?  Because it happens all the time.  They go on the show and they're like oh so and so is going to be boring.  So and so is going to be lame.  And then right after the show is over it's hey they were really good.  Every time.  I know.  It's like.  They I think Opie and Anthony downplay the easy going and fun nature that this room not  for people like me you Roland and Eric but for guests for when Hollywood guests come  in it's like a very fun hang relaxing thing. 
[03:37:00]  It's not a tense thing.  For me Roland and Eric it's.  Torturous.  It's horrible yes.  But for for guests it's like a fun relaxing thing and that gets guests to open up and  I think that that's something that Opie and Anthony tend to forget.  Yeah.  You know.  That's why people oh you have an easy job you relax like what.  No I haven't relaxed in six years.  Same here.  You know.  And you you have to deal with Opie and Anthony and then you have to deal with the publicist. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  So it's like don't forget this.  Don't forget that.  Don't say this.  Yeah.  But uh.  Yeah.  And then tomorrow it'll be busy show too.  Who's on tomorrow.  Can you say.  Oh yeah.  Uh tomorrow Pat Oswald.  Whoa.  Nice.  For the whole show.  For the whole show he's hanging.  Yeah he's hanging for the whole show.  Wow.  Is he coming in early?  Really early yeah.  So he's gonna be hanging hanging.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  What's he promoting?  Nothing.  Nothing?  He's just coming to hang out.  I love that.  He's filming right now in New York.  And then it'll be Pat in.  Then Nick DePaulo's coming in later. 
[03:38:00]  And then Nick Swanson.  Wow.  I don't think we have enough comedians is the only problem.  Not enough funny people.  I don't think so.  Yeah.  We gotta book a couple more.  And then Brewer is Friday.  That's great.  Jim Brewer is uh.  And then Kevin Smith is supposed to call in about uh his red state on demand.  It's on demand.  It's not a GDD yet though.  No.  Uh October.  You sure?  Why is it on demand now and not on DVD until October?  I thought it was coming to theaters.  It still is.  From what I.  He did the on demand but he's still also doing a promotional theater tour with it. 
[03:38:30]  Oh it's a.  It's not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was.  He did the Midwest and East then he took a little break and he's doing the rest of the  Midwest and the South.  I thought the original plan was for it to go wide.  Well because we already saw it in theaters a while ago.  Oh I didn't see it.  Oh you didn't see it?  When it was doing Radio City and the speaking and all that.  Yeah I remember.  But now they're going to release it on Blu-ray in October though.  But it's not.  It's not getting a wide theatrical release.  Um no.  I think he's going right now to London to do the tour that he did here but over there. 
[03:39:00]  Oh I see.  Wow.  Yeah.  This is.  He's.  He's releasing this movie internationally by himself.  Well it's smart though because you figure people are so busy everybody's just going to  buy the Blu-ray anyways.  Why don't you just give it to them now?  I think what was confusing was that he was supposed to do the theater release like he was making  deals with smaller theaters but then he got distribution through Lionsgate.  So now he doesn't have to do that.  They'll just put the DVD out.  So the purpose of going wide was to get DVD distribution.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  But he already got it.  The reason why he succeeded he read Game On.  Is that it?  He took Emmett Smith's book Game On.  He read it.  By the way I'll pick up Opie's book which he went home with a book.  That was.  Yeah.  The new copy.  The original copy.  It's next to the garbage can because he didn't realize he was going to go home with it.  Game On.  Find your pursuit.  Find your purpose.  Pursue your dream.  Right here.  Do you think that's what Kevin Smith was reading? 
[03:40:00]  Right here.  A little inspiration.  My favorite quote that he does is to change your life right away make sure you dye your  hair blonde on a cruise.  Oh my god.  Eric.  Yeah.  You understand that was a shot at you, right?  I heard.  He doesn't say I'm blonde.  I don't get jokes.  Are you realizing you're more of an airhead now, Eric?  What?  More of an airhead?  Hmm?  Nah, never mind.  Okay.  He's more vain.  Yeah.  More time in the mirror.  Maybe I should.  You think we should take the call here, Roland? 
[03:40:30]  It's a...  Uh, wait.  Let's look at the time here.  We're about an hour and nine minutes on hold.  And he was on hold earlier.  I mean...  Bobo?  Yeah.  He tweeted earlier.  Opie mentioned on the show...  Never to leave him alone.  The Bobo was just staying on hold for the entire show.  And out of nowhere, he tweeted that he wasn't going to do my after show anymore.  And I informed him that he wasn't asked to.  Who cares?  Yeah.  I didn't invite him on the after show. 
[03:41:00]  No one cares.  Like, Mick Foley was on the after show two weeks ago.  That we care about.  Yeah.  You think I'm, like, hungry for Bobo?  But he has to act like he's a big star.  And so now he's asking to get back on the after show.  Bobo?  Yeah.  I'm here.  Why?  What are you doing, dude?  You don't have a card to play.  I know.  Well, what happened was...  I heard Opie got offended by me...  Very offended.  You all got offended by me refusing to do your show. 
[03:41:30]  Well...  That's not why they got offended.  They don't like Bobo.  You seem to be carrying yourself all of a sudden.  Like you're a big star.  Like, I'm too good to do this.  I'm too good to do that.  When you're just, like...  You know...  Everybody has fun doing the after show.  And of all the shows, you don't get mistreated on the after show ever.  Do you? 
[03:42:00]  No, it's just because I felt like I've gotten...  That's some of the times I've been on that.  It was times that I felt like I was snubbed.  Not every time.  Snubbed on the after show?  Look.  Not every time.  Not every time.  Oh, wait.  You're never booked.  Triple H is still listening to this.  Do I want to what?  Check a check on Triple H.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobo, what's the problem?  Well, it somehow got offended to them that they canceled the contest.  I want to plead that I'll be getting you things on this channel as long as they reinstate the contest. 
[03:42:30]  You can't because he blocked you on Twitter.  I literally have my forehead leaning against the microphone right now.  This is exhausting.  Bobo, how many times are you going to be banned, get emotional, only to find out you're not banned anymore?  How many times?  I have no idea.  What I do know is that... 
[03:43:00]  Why do you...  I was upset because I spent so much fun getting ready for this contest.  Bobo, it's just...  I had to make sure I do that to find any form.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Why?  Why?  Well, I want to bring everyone in.  The contest that Bobo is talking about is, of course, win a date with Bobo, and it's a sponsored contest.  Use logic, Bobo.  It's a sponsored contest.  How could we just cancel it?  Wouldn't the sponsor be really upset? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, but the thing is, I kind of feel that Obi could overwrite it if he wanted to.  And...  What's going on?  I think they even said it by...  I meant...  I think they even said it by...  Bobo, you can't...  We got to stop doing this.  Hey, Bobo, do you realize there was no problem at all with this contest?  None.  Until you started posting on Twitter that there was a fucking problem? 
[03:44:00]  What was the problem with the contest?  Nothing.  You want to be on the show.  You get so upset that you're not on the show.  We think of a bit that we can use you for, and it's still a problem.  You cut the damn promo for it.  Look, Bobo, you got to chill out.  Like, you don't work for the show.  You can't come on here every day.  I know that.  Why don't you start a blog? 
[03:44:30]  Why don't you start a Bobo.com website and start a blog?  Or you got to have some kind of creative outlet.  You're not making the YouTube videos.  I saw you had a YouTube channel, but you're not making them.  You should be making a new video every single day.  That's exactly what he should be doing.  I tried to get what I thought would have been YouTube gold, but my uncle doesn't want to do this.  Look, Bobo, I don't need...  I wanted to do something nice.  I don't need excuses, Bobo.  I don't...  Bobo, no, no. 
[03:45:00]  No excuses.  I don't get excuses from Emmett Smith.  I don't want excuses from you.  Okay?  All right.  Let's get our game on and find your purpose and pursue your dream, Bobo.  Didn't you listen to Emmett Smith when he was in here?  Look, you should be...  Yeah, I did.  I know you did.  You should be recording...  I didn't understand it.  I know you didn't.  You should be making...  I'm still talking.  I know he is.  Of course he is.  You should be making a new YouTube video every single day, getting it out on your Twitter,  and just pushing the Bobo brand. 
[03:45:30]  All right?  If you want to be like a big star, which is fine.  We all do.  So, you can't just keep calling here.  You gotta...  We're not...  Not...  We'll have you on when we have you on.  I have an update.  Yeah.  Triple H is coming soon.  The Sammies will come soon back.  Sammies coming back in here?  Yeah, so you have Triple H and Sammy back here.  Hang up on him!  We got guests.  You're right.  I just...  If you have to do a break, do you in now before Triple H? 
[03:46:00]  No, I think we're good.  We don't know.  Hey, what's Hits...  What's Hits1 doing out there lingering?  Are they trying to poach?  Um, let's find out.  I'm sorry.  Look, guys, listeners, I'm talking to you out there in Radio Land.  I'm sorry about Bobo.  I get bonus interviews.  Yeah, I love it.  I try to put on something nice to listen to on this after show, but he just stays on hold.  He always has a problem with something.  Um, also, we need money to donate so Piff can buy a bigger t-shirt. 
[03:46:30]  Mikey Piff, who's the producer for the morning mashup, is outside, and Roland likes to take shots at him.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I know.  People make fun of me.  I wear tight t-shirts.  He wears tight t-shirts.  Take a look.  Mikey Piff on Twitter.  Oh, what are they doing?  They're waiting for Sammy to come out so they get photos.  And please do not Twitter him about getting a bigger size t-shirt.  I beg of you.  Well, make sure they know before they get their little pictures, Sammy's got some place to be.  Can you go outside, Roland, and block them like this?  Sorry, she's got to get on the air live right now.  We don't have a lot of time left on the after show. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, my God.  We're trying to pack it.  It's the king of pictures himself.  Who?  Stanley T.  Stanley loves his picture.  But you know what?  On this show, we can't make fun of anybody for getting pictures.  I do.  I get pictures.  Eric gets more pictures than I do.  Jim gets more pictures than Eric does.  I know, but Stanley is very dramatic about his pictures.  He is.  Steve Sterniolo outside.  And by the way, you were talking about Jim Brewer?  I think I may be co-hosting Comedy by Request with him today.  Now, I could be embarrassed by saying that. 
[03:47:30]  He just left, though.  Well, I mean, then it would just be me.  That's fine with me.  I mean, it's not like, but the reason I could be embarrassed by saying that is they could  at the last minute just say, well, we got Jim Brewer.  He's just going to host it by himself.  It's not a complicated show to do, but tune in because it might be me and Jim Brewer.  It might just be Jim Brewer.  It might just be me from noon to 1 p.m. on Raw Dog Comedy.  Of course, Ron and Fez will be on, and that will probably be better than any combination  of what I just said, so you should probably listen to that just as easily. 
[03:48:00]  What was I going to do?  I just had something, Eric.  Was it about, was it something from today's show?  It was.  That's what it was.  Because maybe we should actually do that once in a while.  I can't believe.  Emmett Smith was great.  Sammy Sweethearts was great.  I can't believe what a star Babu Sherpa became today.  Trending worldwide.  And if you're, I don't know what Roland is saying about me outside right now, but I just 
[03:48:30]  got looks from the people outside.  If you're just tuning in right around now, and you don't know who Babu Sherpa is, whew,  do you have a show to listen to?  For around 4.30 in the afternoon.  That's about when it'll be on?  That's when all that starts.  I mean, you know by now the replay starts at 3 p.m. Eastern.  Um, but yeah, Babu Sherpa.  I guess I'm not as quick on the internet as people would like me to be.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Looking for a video that didn't exist?  It doesn't exist.  This is what people don't understand.  Opie, Anthony, whatever, they spout out these words that are just like non-specific keywords.  Uh, black hole eating a star.  Find that video.  And then everybody gets upset when I can't find it because it doesn't exist, but nobody  admits that it never existed in the first place.  Like, I'm sorry.  It's not there.  Well, well, well, that's not true.  There wasn't an apology, but towards the end of it, Opie kind of said, well, maybe that 
[03:49:30]  was the video I saw.  The first one that you started with, hour and so later, maybe that was the one.  You mean the one that I got?  So you gotta give him credit.  He did admit it.  The one that I got called a moron for putting up in the first place.  Well, that's their call.  Well, that's why they end up getting videos with Rick Rolls on them.  Because eventually, I lose my passion for Googling.  You should find other NPR stuff and just play it under every video.  That's my new thing.  That's my new thing.  Just have an NPR player going the whole time.  I love that idea.  So, yeah, if you don't know, I think we're trying to get Babu Sherpa. 
[03:50:00]  On the show?  Yeah, I mean, there is a guy.  It's B-A-B-U-S-H-E-R-P-A.  And his Twitter name is That1965.  BabuSherpa1965.  The real Babu is dead.  So, I don't know who this guy is, but today he gained probably about 300 followers.  Should be more by the time you hear this.  The replay kicks in.  It'll be a lot more. 
[03:50:30]  And I guess we're going to make this guy a Twitter star.  I hope so.  You know?  But whatever.  Did he post anything today?  No, no, no.  He hasn't posted anything since May.  I don't know what he's doing.  But this is a question.  Maybe he's dead, too.  You're still in charge?  He could be dead.  He could have died in May.  He hasn't posted anything since then.  Anthony today, I think it was on the air, unless it was off the air.  Oh!  That's what I wanted to mention.  How about Gary, our boss, Management Gary, from the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:51:00]  Not Baba Booey Gary.  Our Gary.  We got a Gary, too.  That's right.  We ripped that off as well.  Our Gary coming on the air today.  Let's give him a round of applause.  Because it's a risky thing, the way everything is set up here.  Like, I know, it's just, it's not, whether it's a bad or a good thing, it doesn't matter.  Most of management stays away from the on-air product just to avoid whatever that is. 
[03:51:30]  Well, we got two of the three now.  And now, Rob Cross is basically a regular on the show.  He's hosted this show.  Not well.  But he has, I guess you'd call it hosted.  No, no, no, no.  Rob Cross didn't host the show.  Was that Chuck Roast?  Chuck Roast hosted the show.  Chuck Roast hosted the show.  Gary was on the air today.  And I hope Gary learned a valuable lesson.  Because he gets shit on a lot to the point where I feel bad for him.  Like, they just smash him to bits.  The minute Gary came on the air and started talking to Opie, Opie was like, hey, nice 
[03:52:00]  new glasses.  Because it's like, now I'm talking to you face-to-face on the air.  You know, alright, I guess maybe you're not Satan.  Recognizing him as a person.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.  I'm not saying that Opie was double-talking.  I'm just saying that when you're face-to-face, there's a greater chance that Opie will, like  you said, Eric, recognize that you too are a human being in this little world of ours.  So, congratulations to Gary for his very first...  Oh, my gosh. 
[03:52:30]  You've got five minutes.  Five minutes.  Triple H is here.  Welcome, Triple H.  Did you ever...  What's going on?  Now, there's a few YouTube videos with you and I.  You should be aware of this by now, I hope.  I'm sure.  I'm hoping.  You have your clothes on in them?  I do.  Thank God.  Much to my chagrin.  That was your request.  But all of them are you sort of pointing out how I kind of lurk at all of the WWE press  events.  Are you scared that you're now in a studio where I'm behind the microphone? 
[03:53:00]  Like, now this is actually my show.  I was actually told on my way in here that today, as we were driving in the car, that  you had your own show, which on one hand I'm thrilled and proud of you for, and on the  other hand, I'm worried about Sirius XM radio.  Don't be worried about Sirius XM radio.  I'm actually thinking of maybe selling some of my stock.  Just get rid of all of them.  Yeah, obviously.  They're really scraping the bottom now.  Well, you know what?  A lot of people thought that at first, but they're starting to get a feel for it. 
[03:53:30]  You know who was in here for a full, like, 30, 40 minutes the other day?  Who's that?  Mick Foley.  Your old buddy Mick Foley was in here.  And changing his tune on the WWE, he's become a giant fan.  What do you think of Mick Foley?  I love Mick.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mick's a great guy.  Mick is very smart.  He is.  You know, I don't know.  It's one of those things.  Whenever anybody leaves the company, they always have bad things to say about the company, 
[03:54:00]  and then they love the company when they want to come back.  Yeah.  You know, it's such a horrible place, but everybody wants to work here.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  It's one of those things, too, I think, when you, you know, when you leave, it's hard to  say, what, are you going to leave a place and then go, like, nah, they're so great.  They're doing all the right things.  That's why they got rid of me.  And, you know what I mean?  It's also because, like, there's a reason you're leaving, so that's fresh in your mind.  Exactly.  And then you give it time, and you recollect on everything that happened, and you're like,  you know, those guys are actually pretty great over there.  Yeah.  You know, anybody that left the job and then said, like, actually, it's the perfect place to work. 
[03:54:30]  I wish I was still there, but unfortunately, I wanted to leave.  Yeah, one day I'll have horrible things to say about SiriusXM, and then I'll be podcasting  somewhere and think, those guys were actually pretty good.  They had, you know, an audience.  Those checks actually cashed.  Yeah, they cashed, and people listened.  Well, speaking of checks cashing, a lot of them are going to be cashing for you, because  you're a movie star now.  You have another movie coming out.  I do have another movie coming out.  I have a movie coming out this Friday called Inside Out that I did with Michael Rappaport,  Parker Posey, Bruce Dern. 
[03:55:00]  These are big stars.  Yeah, and me.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, it's not like it's just some goofy movie.  It's like, and the Chaperone had stars in it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Including me, too.  Including you.  That's what I'm saying.  The weirdest thing.  You're a movie star now, all of a sudden.  Yeah.  That's a little strange.  It was also in Blade.  And you were in Blade.  In Blade.  And when you look at that, that was Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds, and you can't get  any bigger than that.  Yeah, and you.  And me.  And you.  Right.  Triple H.  That's the thing.  So I'm in good company in those things.  So where can people see the movie? 
[03:55:30]  It's in select theaters right now for a few weeks, and it'll be out in DVD in a couple  of weeks, and you can check it out there.  It's actually a good film.  I'm proud of it.  It was a lot of fun to work on.  I've worked with Parker twice now, because I worked with her in Blade, and I worked with her  on this, and she's a blast.  Very, very, very talented.  And Michael Rappaport is just a great dude.  Apparently, he's around here all the time doing all the sports shows.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's serious.  But he's a great dude, and in the movie, we have to play lifelong friends, and it was 
[03:56:00]  real easy to do with him, because he's just such a good guy.  He was just in here promoting his Tribe Called Quest documentary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm anxious to see that.  Yeah, I haven't seen it.  He wasn't in here.  Oh, oh.  He did other shows.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He won't come on the after show yet.  But once I tell him that there's movie stars like Triple H.  Well, if I tell him like Triple H did it, he's going to come in for sure.  That's what I'm saying.  Mick Foley, too.  Yeah.  What's the name of the movie again?  Inside Out.  Okay, so Inside Out.  Think of your underwear every other day.  Inside Out. 
[03:56:30]  That way they're clean every single day.  The WWE Network.  Yeah.  I saw the commercial.  Yeah.  I was watching Raw on Monday.  Awesome.  Obviously.  Yeah.  What else am I going to do?  And listen, I'm not going to tell you who to hire and fire.  That's up to you.  So, but I have three ideas for shows already for the WWE Network.  Would you be the guy I'd be hiring or firing?  Hiring.  At first.  At first.  At first.  At first.  At first.  All right.  Give me a chance.  But, I mean, they do.  When I fire you, will you have bad things to say about the company?  At first.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:57:00]  But then I'll look at my WWE merchandise collection when I get back to my apartment.  As you're podcasting once again.  As I'm podcasting.  You'll go like, damn it, that serious thing was good and that WWE thing.  I shouldn't have said those things.  Yeah.  But, I mean, now these shows that I have worked out in my head, they are.  Don't tell me because then you lose your proprietary information.  Right.  And I wouldn't say it on the air anyway because this is going to be private business meeting.  Somebody steal your ideas, you know.  And these are good ideas.  They involve me as the host.  Right.  Obviously.  Which, you know, how can they be bad ideas? 
[03:57:30]  Exactly.  And it's a very, you know, with the WWE, I think a little youth, a youth host.  What do you think the odds are of me ending up on the WWE Network?  Sam Roberts for WWE.  Well, listen, a year ago, if you'd have said you're going to go sit on Sam's show.  Right.  On Sirius XM, I would have said, like, kick you out of your mind, right?  Yeah.  So, a year from now, maybe you're hosting something on WWE Network.  Maybe you're not out of your mind.  I don't know.  I love it.  Yeah. 
[03:58:00]  So, you're saying there's a chance.  There's a chance, yes.  You're getting back in the ring, too.  I am.  Yeah.  In a week and a half at Night of Champions pay-per-view.  You haven't wrestled in six months or so?  I have not wrestled in six months.  This was a bit of a last-minute thing.  I'm feverishly working on getting my expanding waistline down, too.  I was about to ask.  Are you just constantly in ring shape or are you just like, look, we need you in there.  We need something.  You've got to get in now.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what happened.  And, no.  So, you know, I try to stay in pretty good shape. 
[03:58:30]  But ring shape is completely different from pretty good shape.  Especially when it's like, I haven't wrestled in six months.  Everybody's anxious to see.  Yeah.  You can run on a treadmill or on a stair climber all day.  But until somebody's whacking you with a chair while you're doing it, it's a whole different ballgame.  But we're not yet at the point where it's Triple H wrestling in a t-shirt territory.  No.  Yeah.  I'm hoping to avoid that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm really hoping to avoid the whole I have to wear a t-shirt and long pants or something like that phase. 
[03:59:00]  Well, me, too.  I'm just getting a note that you have to go.  You're all over the place.  I would keep you here all day.  I'm a big star, you know.  I know.  As you expressed earlier, you know, I've got things to go and places to be or whatever it is.  Whatever it is.  It tends to happen with movie stars.  So, the movie again?  Inside Out.  Like your underpants.  Yes, exactly.  I'm not wearing any.  With Triple H and Michael Rappaport or Parker Posey and the whole gang.  So, Google it.  Find out if it's playing in your area.  And if not, get it on DVD. 
[03:59:30]  Hopefully, I'll be joining you soon.  Yeah.  In the WWE part of the network.  Look forward to working with you on the network.  It's fantastic.  Awesome, man.  You said it, Triple H.  Thank you for stopping by.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  Look, Sammy Sweetheart's here from the Jersey Shore.  Do you know her?  I don't, but I'm looking forward to meeting her right now.  You know Ron Bennington?  You should know Ron.  No, I don't either, but I'm looking forward to meeting him also.  Not quite as much as her, but a little bit less.  But still, yeah.  I could understand that.  We're on the air, Sammy, just so you know.  Yeah, don't say anything obscene.  Well, you can, because really.  Yeah, you can. 
[04:00:00]  I mean, you just have to know you're saying it on the air.  Yeah, plus no one's listening to you, right?  What, Triple H has to go?  Oh, they're calling you.  Your guys are panicking.  Yeah, the Shade 45 guys are about to come over here and go gangster on you.  Yeah.  Well, if there's any bullet holes in this class, we'll know where it came from.  See you, man.  Thank you, Triple H.  Now, Ron Bennington, thank you for stopping by.  Triple H.  Take care, buddy.  Did you ever think when this show started, Ron, that you'd have Triple H, Sammy Sweetheart?  Yes.  You did.  This was the dream.  This was the actual dream.  Oh, cool.  Sammy, nice to see you.  Nice to meet you.  Now, I'm Ron, and this is Sammy, so we're kind of our own kind of Ronnie and Sammy's. 
[04:00:30]  We tried to call it.  It's a perfect pair.  The Ronnie.  Is it?  You never know.  Is it?  It might be.  I mean, Ron and me do kind of have the tiffs, and we're on and off again, just like you and Ron.  Oh.  But only when we drink.  That's the only time we have trouble.  Me too, for some reason.  You know what?  What are the odds of that?  Me too.  Now, what's, is this all about the perfume today?  It's a perfume and the Jersey Shore, right?  Yeah.  We talk about, I mean, it's still on the air.  Oh, it is still on the air?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:01:00]  But you're wrapping up Italy and then going into Jersey.  Yeah, and then we go straight from Italy back to Seaside, Jersey, and film there.  What was better?  Jersey, because it's like home for me.  So when we come back from Italy, it was like we had to really adapt to the country and really  learn how to live there, whereas, you know, we're back in Seaside.  We've been there.  We're comfortable there, and it's like home to me, so.  So, Sam, is this your favorite?  Sammy Sweetheart?  Yeah, she's my favorite.  Out of the entire cast.  Yes, of course.  Out of the entire cast. 
[04:01:30]  Yes, out of the entire cast, you're the one.  Like we said, Snooki won't come in here for a second.  Every single cast member will.  Vinny comes in and just hangs out for the whole show.  Oh, cool.  And he brings Uncle Nino with him.  Oh, I love Uncle Nino.  So they're like our friends now.  Uncle Nino's great.  Sitch has been in here.  Pauly D's been in here.  JWoww's been in here.  You've been in here.  Ron's never been in.  You should call him.  I would love to have Ron.  He's fun.  So you guys are happy together again?  Yeah.  Actually, starting now, you're going to see a different side of our relationship.  And the drama isn't on us anymore, and it's kind of on other people in the house. 
[04:02:00]  Oh.  And other relationships.  Because that's what they say.  The other cast members are like, look, we're just trying to have a good, like Vinny and  Pauly are like, we're just trying to have a good time.  And Ronnie and Sammy are always with this drama.  Yeah, but don't you feel like they get in their business, though?  Yeah.  Like the other people are trying to stir you up.  Some people do.  It's just like, what do you do when you're stuck in a house and you're like forced to  hang out with each other and like live with each other?  And me and Ron are the only people that have a relationship in that house.  So everybody's always involved in the business. 
[04:02:30]  Everybody's always there.  They have to get involved.  They have no choice.  We live with each other.  We're like forced to be with each other.  I mean, but I don't care what anybody else has to say.  Like, I'm still going to do whatever I'm going to do.  Is the sitch still jealous?  Because season one, you remember season one, it was the sitch.  No.  They were trying to get with Sammy.  I just think the sitch is crazy in general.  He seems to have a rage that builds up when he drinks.  Have you seen him?  Have you seen the episodes when he?  I saw the episode.  He seems to have a rage problem, doesn't he?  The situation?  He's just crazy.  Like, I don't know how to just put it. 
[04:03:00]  Like, he's just nuts.  Yeah.  Did you ever think about taking Ronnie Pest at an AA meeting, though?  Just to be sure.  A what?  An AA meeting.  Ronnie.  I call it anonymous?  Yeah.  Because his personality changes so much when he's drinking.  You know what's so crazy?  Like, on that show, you kind of, like, have no choice but to drink, party, and hang out  with each other.  So, like, there's a lot of alcohol.  And mostly when there's fights between me and Ron, or mostly in the house, it's when  a lot of alcohol is involved.  And we're there for a long time, so you're not seeing, like, the whole gist.  He doesn't drink all the time. 
[04:03:30]  Ron is actually, like, great.  He drinks like any other young, you know, adult would these days.  He is normal, and he's just partying and enjoying himself.  He doesn't need to go to AA.  My God.  You guys used to, obviously, before the show, go out all, not with each other, but  everybody on the show used to go out to clubs and stuff all the time.  That's kind of what the show is based on.  I would imagine that you can't go out anymore unless you're sponsored to be at this club  hosting.  It's just crazy.  Like, now it's because we do have a lot of fans, which is awesome.  Everybody's, like, really, really positive, and, like, they're so cool.  And when we go out, it's like, they just, like, swarm you. 
[04:04:00]  So, it's hard to, like, when in the old days, like, before the Jersey Shore, you could go  out and nobody will recognize you.  So, you have all this space in the world.  And now when you go out, like, everybody knows who you are.  So, you don't really have privacy, but it's fun.  Like, I enjoy it.  It's a different part of my life now, and I enjoy it.  You like the paparazzi?  But when it's over, you'll be ready to go back to real life?  You know what's cool is, like, now that the show I'm done filming, I'm kind of back in  my normal life.  I like to be a homebody.  I like to be with my family and my friends from home, and I still do that.  And I actually have a private life at home.  And I have, like, my life for the Jersey Shore. 
[04:04:30]  So, I actually have a balance.  She does seem to be the most private of the cast members.  Easily.  Yeah.  I don't like to really, I mean, I like to have a balance where I'm out there, but I  also have my own private life with my family and friends.  Because I enjoy being kind of normal, per se.  Yeah, but do you ever...  I don't know how normal that is, but kind of, like, normal.  Do you ever think of how different your life would be if this one thing didn't happen?  I mean, just...  I still, if this didn't happen, I would still be going to school or playing soccer and working,  like, every single other person in this world would be doing. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  I would just be living the everyday normal life where you're supposed to go to college  and you're supposed to find a job, and you just do what you love, and I would be playing  soccer and doing the hobbies, like, art.  That's what I would be doing.  Yeah.  And people don't even realize how fast this was, because, yeah, they filmed five seasons,  but they did it...  It's only two years.  They did it in two years.  So, it's, like, two years ago.  It's just go, go, go, go, go.  Like, we've been on the go, and it's fun.  Yeah.  This is something, like, where I'm older, I can look back and be like, wow, I have such amazing memories.  Well, you know what is funny is, like, I think it's going to follow you for the rest of your 
[04:05:30]  life, because the early MTV, VJs all got back together, and the ones from the 80s.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, like, they're on one of the channels here.  Cool.  And people never forget them, and that becomes that thing.  And I feel like you're probably that way to this generation, because no one saw this  coming with these kind of ratings.  I mean, they beat regular TV.  And especially with reality shows, it's like, you usually change the cast every season, and  if it's a single cast, you're not going to go more than two seasons.  And they're into their fourth with nine million views. 
[04:06:00]  Does that, like, freak you out that you're like, this thing is still going?  It's so surreal to me, because I'm just like, oh, my God, I still feel like I'm normal.  So when I see this, I'm like, this is so cool.  Like, I don't think of myself as this big celebrity or this big person that's on TV.  So when I, it's just like, it's just like a reality check for me when it's like, wow,  eight point, whatever, a million viewers are watching your show, and I'm just like, wow,  that's an amazing thing.  And I feel truly blessed and honored and appreciative of where I'm at, you know, today.  How many Twitter followers?  I'm almost at a million. 
[04:06:30]  Okay, so that's celebrity status, I think.  She was over a million until Fred Brooklyn helped her.  You heard about that.  And then it went backwards.  Fred from Brooklyn's a listener who, Opie, who was here, you know, you talked to Opie a  couple minutes ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was trying to get to 100,000.  Fred Brooklyn says, I'm going to help you, and starts this campaign.  And all of a sudden, he's losing followers.  Oh, no.  So I don't know what's going on.  Oh, no, poor guy.  What are people in, like, your town, like, who you grew up with and stuff?  You know what's cool?  Is there a different vibe now?  With some people that I was never really close with, you could see, like, a difference. 
[04:07:00]  But with my true friends, we're still the same.  Like, they treat me the same.  They don't think of me as any different, which I like, because I don't like to be treated  like I'm a celebrity.  I like to be Samantha Jancola from Hazlitt.  I don't want to be Sammy Sweetheart when I'm home with my friends and family, because  it's, you know, it's like, I want to be normal.  I want to try and be, I liked my private life, and I like where I'm at now, so I kind of  try and, like, balance it out where I have that, both.  It seems like, on the other hand, Snooki and, like, the situation, and maybe Pauly D a little 
[04:07:30]  bit, too, kind of dove right into that celebrity life, and they kind of want it always, like,  always around them, you know?  Yeah, I think, like, what's cool is we all enjoy this.  We all love it to death.  Like, we love what we do.  But everybody's different, and I'm just different from, you know, Nicole, and I'm just, we're  just all different, and however they take this, that's awesome.  They're all, like, great.  My cast members and my roommates and my friends are amazing.  And they're just doing their thing, and I'm proud of all of them.  You don't get jealous, though, when you see the others, like, popping up with side projects? 
[04:08:00]  I've never been jealous.  I'm a jealous person, and I'm a competitive person, and I know that if I, it's not a good  quality.  It's horrible.  Truthfully, I'm not jealous, because I think we all have something to give and show to this  world, and we all have, like, a gift.  We're all unique.  We're all different.  And just because I'm not throwing out there, like, some other of my castmates doesn't mean  that I'm not doing well for myself.  So I'm not jealous of anybody.  You should start DJing in the clubs.  No, I want to do my own thing.  I don't like to copy people.  All right, then we ought to get you on that women's soccer team.  Yeah, that was so cool.  I love soccer. 
[04:08:30]  Well, did you watch when the women were in the club?  I was actually filming, but I heard all about it.  My mom was telling me all about it, because I do enjoy soccer so much.  So that was just surreal.  Like, that was so cool.  I'm so proud of the U.S.  They did an awesome job.  That's why you have to learn to be more like Ronnie B., Ron Bennington here.  He was doing his show, but also watching the soccer at the same time.  Do you enjoy to watch soccer?  You know what?  I only got into it a few years ago because of the international soccer, but now every  year I get more and more and more.  Because a lot of people don't normally watch soccer here in the U.S., which is cool now 
[04:09:00]  because the U.S. has, and because the international, there was a lot of things going on with the  U.S. succeeding and moving on in the playoffs that now a lot of people are watching it, and  I think that's awesome.  Yeah, all the teams are doing well now in the U.S.  I mean, I still haven't picked up on the soccer thing.  Well, you're still into wrestling.  A lot of people don't, but I enjoy it.  I mean, I was freaking out.  I couldn't care less when Emmett Smith was sitting there and Triple H walked in and I  was freaking out.  So that's kind of where I'm at.  I'm more the pro wrestling, Jersey Shore type of person.  I saw those pictures of you getting dolls for your birthday. 
[04:09:30]  They were action figures, but I mean...  Some G.I. Joes?  Yeah, that's what I was talking to Alpy about.  He said nobody gets sexually stimulated by elbows.  Do you think that...  I said that's not true.  I said there...  I'm not saying I do.  By an elbow?  I'm saying there are people.  I've never even heard of this.  But there must be people.  It's a little creepy.  Because he's...  It was a whole thing.  But I am going to stand by that there's got to be somebody out there who's sexually stimulated  by elbows.  It's a creepy little weird fetish.  Well, I mean, we all have our weird stuff, but... 
[04:10:00]  It's carny stuff.  Seriously, it's carny stuff.  After the carnival's closed down and what's going on in those trailers.  Lord knows.  Do you worry that you're not going to be able to shake the fame after the Jersey Shore is  done and you won't be able to get into a real life?  No.  You know what I mean?  Or do you kind of embrace it?  I embrace everything.  I embrace my life.  I embrace where I'm at today.  And if I no longer have this anymore, so be it.  But it happened in my life, so I'll always look back and have memories and, you know... 
[04:10:30]  It seems like you're harping on this over and over, dude.  What?  I mean, she just said...  I mean, later in life.  She's very leveled into this.  She's fine.  When this is over, she's going to be happy.  She's saving her money.  Everything's going great for her.  Not only is she saving her money, she's coming up with these new products.  Now she's got perfume.  Yeah.  I'm really excited about my perfume.  Now, where is it available at?  You can get it at Mandy's, which is a teenage woman's clothing store.  Or you can get it at dangerousperfume.com. 
[04:11:00]  Nice.  Dangerousperfume.com.  And Mandy's is a big store.  I know the teenage girl population.  I know what they're into.  Mandy's is big.  And it's affordable.  It's an affordable perfume.  So it really applies to, you know, women and young teenagers and girls out there.  Great.  They're wrapping her up out there.  It was a pleasure meeting you.  It was nice meeting you.  Thank you so much for having me.  And I just like that Ronnie and Sammy could become Ronnie and Sammy and Sammy.  Right.  It was really nice.  Cool.  It was something special.  That is cool.  I like to take credit when Ron and Sam is trending on Twitter. 
[04:11:30]  Does it ever work at all?  I mean, G-Baby jumps on board with me.  But beyond that, just Jermaine.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Well, thank you for stopping by the After Show.  Ron Bennington, thank you for giving us a little bit of time.  I'm glad that you were able to do this.  You had just a blockbuster show today.  I'm glad you were here.  It became a blockbuster once you got here.  Well, I wanted to, you know, bye-bye, darling.  Thank you, Sammy.  I just wanted to come walking in with her just for the Ronnie and Sammy joke.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what I was like. 
[04:12:00]  Other than that, I had nothing else.  I was hoping you would.  I was pleased.  Because I saw you just staring at me when I was interviewing Triple H.  I saw him leaning back and forth trying to make you feel weird.  Did you notice that I was just trying to lock eyes with Triple H and ignore you?  I mean, for you, that's your man.  Yeah.  I was freaking out and talking to Eric and Roland about please get him on.  Roland, I mean, to say that you made up for the Kardashians not coming on yesterday is an understatement.  Triple H, thank you so much.  Now, why wouldn't the Kardashians come on?  Because they came a little bit late.  And they did like an hour with one of the other channels.  It doesn't have anything to do with the way Opie sends tweets. 
[04:12:30]  I was going to try to apologize on behalf of Opie.  Oh, she wouldn't do ONA.  She would only do the after show.  Oh, no.  They were hosting from 10 to 11.05 Cosmo.  Yeah, because they didn't get here until 10, so they wouldn't have done ONA anyway.  Yeah, they're everywhere right now, right?  They are.  So, who's bigger to you, the Jersey Shore people or the Kardashians?  It depends on what.  I would say Kim Kardashian's bigger than Sami, but Khloe's not bigger than Snooki.  You know what I mean? 
[04:13:00]  Yes, she is.  Yeah, but what about as a team?  As a team?  The Kardashians.  You're talking the whole Jersey Shore cast?  Yeah, I'm talking about the Jersey Shore cast.  Like, it was a battle of the bands.  Let's call him Chris Stanley because he's generation next.  That's right.  To your generation, what I like to now refer to as the Game Boy generation, the Discman generation.  That's what VH1's calling us.  The Kardashians or the Jersey Shores?  The Jersey Shores are eclipsing the Kardashians. 
[04:13:30]  See, here's what I think.  I think that the Kardashians skew a little older.  They're like a housewife show.  I would have said this, season one, or maybe season two, I would have said Jersey Shore.  But that Kardashians reality show keeps moving up and up.  So does the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, but the Jersey Shore beats the other shows on regular TV.  That's true.  It beats the Wednesday night lineup.  It's insane.  Network scripted shows.  By the way, I thought that we'd be teasing Sami a little bit, but she's really a nice girl. 
[04:14:00]  She is.  And she seems level-headed, yeah.  She's the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.  But she is my favorite on the whole show.  She is.  You like her.  I like the, I'm laying down and I'm not going to be part of the show.  Yeah.  She does seem, I mean, all the guys who come in here, like even Vinny, like Vinny's our  buddy, but he comes in and he's like, yeah, I'm doing this clothing line and Uncle Nino's  doing this wine line.  And Sami's just like, well, I'm trying to sell perfume. 
[04:14:30]  I like to play soccer and lay down.  Yeah.  Come on in.  And situations like, did you see my new laundry bag I'm selling?  I will tell you, and I hope this isn't offensive to your guests because this is your show.  Sure.  But the people that I would say, look to see if alcoholism plays into it.  Ronnie?  Yeah.  Sami?  You think so?  Her personality changes.  Yeah.  Um, I don't think Sish, the new girl, definitely.  Yeah, I mean, the new girl is just booze hound. 
[04:15:00]  I've never seen her sober and I watch the show every week.  But also, like, what did I do that for?  Yeah.  You know, when you're doing that.  But you ever notice, like, you go watch Pauly and Vinny and they never.  They're always just cool.  Yeah, they're just having drinks.  But the situation is a problem when he, like, he becomes like.  I don't know how much of that is giving me mic time, though.  He doesn't get laid.  He turns, he starts losing his shit a little bit.  Yeah, I don't want to.  So you're thinking sex addict.  He's a sex addict without a doubt.  I was about to say, I don't want to say rapey, but he definitely, his vibe changes.  He's a little rapey when he drinks. 
[04:15:30]  Dash of rape.  A little, that dash.  That's right, Pepper.  Before I get into the Ron and Faye show.  Yes, yes, yes.  And good news to everybody.  Sneak peek at I'm Asked with Bill Burr today.  Wow.  We're all very, very excited about that.  But before I get into that, why was Opium invited to your birthday and I wasn't?  I saw.  Opie kind of, he is lucky because he has the connection with his wife, who happens to be  very close with my fiance.  Okay.  And then Opie ends up coming.  Now, would you have come to my parents' house? 
[04:16:00]  I would have been there in a heartbeat.  I wish I had to go up and spend some time with your parents.  I wish I had known.  Kick things around and, you know, see where they're coming from.  You know my parents have ideas.  They would have you.  But where, you guys look like you're as far away as you could be.  Westchester.  Westchester?  The best Chester.  New Rochelle.  New Rock.  No, isn't that where the Petries are from?  Where the who?  The Dick Van Dyke show.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Dick Van Dyke was from there.  There's been a couple other New Rochelle mentions. 
[04:16:30]  Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the series.  Did not know that.  Mentioned New Rochelle in one episode.  I know a couple guys selling weight up there.  You do?  Okay, great.  Someone told me that New Rochelle was the first suburb.  I don't know if it was the first.  It was an early one.  It was the first kind of bedroom community.  Oh, look, we don't all have to live in the city.  Daddy can take the train back and forth.  There was a song.  I think it was 45 Minutes to Broadway.  It was about New Rochelle.  It was in some play.  I've never heard this song before.  My dad sings it in the car because there's a sign when you're coming into New Rochelle that says 45 Minutes to Broadway. 
[04:17:00]  And my dad starts singing.  This is something you could have, you know.  Especially if he and I had to go out and get beer or whatever.  Is this the...  We got this song ready to go?  All right, let's hear it.  That's not this song.  45 Minutes to Broadway.  I don't think this is the same one.  Sheep Louch.  I think I'm going to leave you on this song.  Is that okay?  It is okay.  Okay.  Then stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez. 
[04:17:30]  Fez Watley grabbing the stick today.  He is.  And riding the son of a bitch.  Also coming up, your chance to hear Bill Burr unmasked.  Sounds great.  We totally take it.  He's a whole different Bill Burr.  It's about time he took that mask off.  He took that mask off.  Another luchador comedy, Bill.  He comes in here like on O&A.  But who is the guy?  Who am I looking at?  Exactly.  He's deflecting everything with the jokes.  But we get to the heart of Bill Burr.  Thank God.  I'm going to tell you the truth.  My prediction.  He's one of those guys. 
[04:18:00]  You know, he's successful right now.  But he's one of those guys that could really turn that corner.  It feels to me like the corner is going to blow up.  Yeah.  Well, it's not just in popularity.  But coming to things with a really cool angle.  Which, if you look at his career, I think the growth is unbelievable with him.  A little bit like Louis C.K.?  You don't have to compare people to each other.  You're right, Ron.  I do it, too.  I was grilling Sammy Sweetheart.  You said the same thing to her over and over.  You're driving her nuts.  Poor little thing. 
[04:18:30]  She didn't know what to do.  Ronnie was going to come in here like a fucking juiced up gorilla.  Start throwing people around.  I wish it had happened.  Maybe next time.  Who's your favorite on that show?  I like to DJ Pauly D.  He stays out of the drama.  Yeah, I like Pauly, too.  He just, you know.  Pauly's my favorite of the dudes.  Who's your favorite babe?  Of the babes, it's Sammy Sweetheart.  She is.  I like the JWoww, though she's staying out of all the trouble this season.  I like, like, last week I think she screamed, this isn't fun anymore. 
[04:19:00]  I made Bri-Bri and Kathleen from the Bronx laugh when I said, JWoww looks like a stripper's mom.  Cheap shot.  Yeah.  I wouldn't say it if she was in here.  No.  I'd be like, you're my favorite.  I like JWoww seasons one through three.  Season four, she changed.  She lost a lot of weight.  Her personality's a little different.  She's got that new boyfriend.  I don't like that.  I don't like him.  It's a bad influence on her.  He's not the right guy for her.  Okay.  How do you know that?  I know that.  Trust me, Pepper.  Opinionate it.  I have opinions.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez. 
[04:19:30]  They're coming up next.  We'll be back with this nonsense tomorrow.  What?  That's what it is.  I know, but the way you're trying to sum it up and, you know, you're kind of happy with  today's show.  You had big stars in here.  Yeah, I'm happy, but it was, you know, it was nonsense.  Anyway, Ron and Fez are coming up next.  That's a real show.  The Opinionate show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opinionate.  And catch Opinionate live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. 
[04:20:00]  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey. </pre>
