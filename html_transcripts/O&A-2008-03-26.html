<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show returned from vacation with a broadcast packed with chaotic energy and outrageous content.  The show opened with discussion of their recently taped Comedy Central pilot, which prominently featured comedian Keith Robinson violently assaulting Rich Voss and the shaving of Big A’s eyebrows.  Big A’s incredibly bad breath was a recurring gag throughout the show.  Anthony’s vacation activities remained shrouded in mystery, leading to much speculation and teasing from Opie and Jimmy Norton, fueled by listener calls claiming to have spotted him in various locations.  News segments covered Governor Eliot Spitzer’s resignation and the ongoing scandals surrounding his replacement, a blind, black governor.  A bizarre news story about a woman killed by a jumping eagle ray was also discussed.  Jim Norton recounted amusing anecdotes, including an elevator encounter with Bruce Springsteen and several underwhelming celebrity meetings, notably one with Bruce Willis who completely ignored him.  The show also spent considerable time analyzing the increasingly slurred speech of Mets announcer Ralph Kiner, with callers and Kiner's grandson eventually revealing health issues and heavy drinking as the cause.

The show featured interviews with several guests.  Ben Mezrich, author of *Bringing Down the House*, and Dana, the producer of the film adaptation *21*, discussed the book and movie, including Mezrich's experiences carrying large sums of money through airports.  Mixed martial arts fighter Quinton "Rampage" Jackson was interviewed, promoting his upcoming appearance on *The Ultimate Fighter*.  He discussed his career, his views on the UFC and Pride FC,  street fights, and his dislike of nipple pinching.  Rampage also reacted with disgust to a video shown to him of two women defecating and vomiting. The conversation circled back to Rich Voss’s altercation with another comedian from the pilot.  Professional wrestler Triple H then joined the show, discussing his career,  his relationship with Vince McMahon, and a bizarre storyline involving simulated sex with a dummy in a coffin.  He recounted the story alongside the hosts,  reminiscing about past events and the physical demands of professional wrestling.  Numerous comedians called in throughout this segment to promote their shows, including Bob Kelly, Otto and George, Club Soda Kenny, Patrice O'Neal, and Rich Vos.

The show included detailed recounts of their Comedy Central pilot experiences.  One segment focused on a bizarre scene where Sam Roberts, under peer pressure, kissed a drunk, homeless man who had previously boasted about engaging in oral sex in glory holes, all while being filmed in front of Triple H.  This led to discussions about Bob Kelly’s possible bisexuality and Sam’s sexuality, interspersed with anecdotes about transsexual encounters.  This segment also included an ambush shaving of Eastside Dave’s head, continuing the ongoing “Afro Wars” segment.

Another segment focused on ongoing competitions: "Afro Wars," which Dave ultimately lost; the "Biggest Gainer" weight-gain competition, which ended in a stalemate between Dave and Butcher due to disputes over initial weights; and a new game, "What's Up Eastside Dave's Ass," which involved guessing the item Dave had inserted into his rectum (a keychain of him and his wife).  Dave’s various medical issues, including genital hives and a near ball-sack piercing incident, were discussed, along with his other pilot experiences, including drinking a cup containing Big A’s shaved eyebrows, having apples spit into his mouth until near vomiting, and receiving a nipple piercing. The show concluded with a promotion for the O&A Animation Festival, WrestleMania,  Bodog Fantasy Sports, and a reading of listener emails regarding “Whip Em Out Wednesday.”  Various other hosts, including Sam Roberts and Jimmy Norton, were present for multiple segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous Dj's, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio prototype, Opie and Anthony.  I want a petting deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want a petting deer, breast knuckles, squawk them and breast up.  Opie and Anthony.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar.  Are they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out.  What did it smell like in one of them burps? 
[00:01:00]  An old tackle box.  Where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when Fran Drescher starts speaking spack.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And finally, we are back live.  Yes, back from our vacations. 
[00:01:30]  Broadcasting across America.  Hi.  And Canada.  Hello, how is everybody?  Boston's not awake yet.  Why?  Because the Red Sox played in Japan.  Japan, opening day.  The game ended ten minutes ago, I don't know.  But the Red Sox won.  Start the baseball season.  Does it really matter?  Because it was played in Japan.  They like to do that.  Yes, it does matter.  I think it's silly.  It'll count in the standings. 
[00:02:00]  Because Japan is already into April, I guess.  What?  Isn't an opening day like April, not March?  Like, how does that work?  I don't even know.  I don't...  I don't...  It doesn't count to me.  To me, I don't care if it counts in the stats, the records, the team, everything.  For me, it doesn't count.  All right.  Japan.  What day is it?  It's March 26, 2008.  To prove that we are finally live.  Oh, it is?  Because I was listening to some of the replays over the last week, week and a half. 
[00:02:30]  Sounded live.  Sounded live.  And I'm like, wow, is this live?  Oh, no.  It can't be live because I'm listening to this from my living room.  But I got a little confused at times.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Back from vacation.  Actually, we should have started back on Monday.  But we took our regular week off.  Yeah.  Like you're allowed to do every once in a while.  Sure.  And then we had a little TV project that we were doing yesterday and Monday.  Yeah.  Started Monday in a hotel somewhere here in Manhattan. 
[00:03:00]  Five-hour creative meeting.  Yep.  With a bunch of people from L.A.  All those things up on the walls.  They tape papers up on the walls in the hotel and write on them.  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Oh, we'll do that.  Shooka, shooka, shooka.  That's a good idea.  Make that into a post-it and put it on the wall over there.  Change that and then put that card over there.  Tape it to the wall better because the wind seems to be blowing them off the wall. 
[00:03:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  But we actually taped a pilot yesterday for Comedy Central.  And we can tell you this much.  Keith Robinson, who's an animal.  Oh, my God.  He's one of our comedian friends who is too scared to do the radio show.  I was talking to him about that yesterday.  I'm like, why are you scared to do our radio show?  We all want you on our show.  Jimmy tries to get you on the show all the time and you're always busy.  What's that about?  He's from Philly.  He's black. 
[00:04:00]  And he's an animal.  Yeah.  He's just an animal.  He is out of his mind.  And he pretty much beat the crap out of Rich Voss.  That was part of the TV show we taped for Comedy Central.  Yeah.  So you would assume Comedy Central, the Opie and Anthony show, is loosely based around comedy, right?  No, this should have been like one of those ultimate fighting, maybe on Spike or something.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a brutal, brutal beating.  Well, did Voss look bad?  Did he look bad?  Or did he look like he could at least take care of Voss? 
[00:04:30]  He had a couple of good shots.  Voss had more than a couple of good shots.  I think he had two good shots.  Look, Keith definitely beat the crap out of him, but Keith also pissed off Voss to the  point where Voss took out some of his karate moves.  He went karate on his ass.  Yeah.  He went karate on his ass, and he wasn't supposed to.  And wow.  But then Keith just got pissed.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I don't know.  All I saw was Keith pummeling Rich's head and face, just beating the crap out of his head. 
[00:05:00]  But there were some shots where Voss's head went back, and Voss had no idea how to defend  against it.  No.  Because he was in close.  It was terrific.  Because Keith was in close.  If Keith is far away, then Voss is going to get karate on him and start kicking.  Yeah.  But when he got in close, it was just he pummeled Voss's head.  Well, Keith was doing the rope-a-dope on Rich Voss.  Yes.  A little different.  He had a dope against the ropes.  Thank you.  Exactly. 
[00:05:30]  A little different than how Ali used to do it.  The dope-a-dope.  The dope-a-dope.  The dope-a-dope-a-dope.  And then also, as part of this TV taping yesterday, it's a pilot.  We'll see if they pick it up.  Big A got his eyebrows shaved right off.  Oh, my God.  Just when you think Big A couldn't be creepier, yeah, he had his eyebrows shaved off.  Yeah.  And just looked more like a serial rapist than he does now. 
[00:06:00]  Why wasn't he offered a gum or a Tic Tac or something?  Bad?  So bad that the room, let's just say there was a room full of bizarre freaks that we have  known over the years.  Yeah.  And every time we had to go into this room and talk with them, it's the whole room smelled.  The entire room smelled like Big A's breath. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, you could get away with bad breath as long as you're not too close to a person.  Like, let's say I have bad breath.  You guys would never know it.  I'm far away.  Far enough away.  Far enough away.  I could talk to the side.  You do little things, right?  His breath was so bad, like Ant was saying, the whole room smelled.  The whole room.  The whole room.  He infected the entire room so that when he was removed from the room, later on when  we went back in, the smell was gone.  He probably was nervous.  Oh, he had a nervous mouth.  I think when he gets nervous, his mouth glands are wacky. 
[00:07:00]  He gets...  All that with the white crap in the corners of his mouth.  It's the only thing that bothers him, too, that he feels really self-conscious about.  You can make sure...  You can make fun of anything else about Big A, but when it comes to his breath, he gets  really depressed, and he gets that look in his eye like he's going to kill somebody.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't like being joked about.  I believe we also shaved Pat from Manaki's eyebrows. 
[00:07:30]  I'm hearing.  Was it?  I'm hearing, yes.  Yeah, Pat was his normal ham self.  Oh, going back to Big A, I'm getting a communique from Pat Duffy, who's on our phones right now.  Yes.  He writes, I had to sit next to him for hours because Pat was in that room as well.  Yeah.  I think my clothes still smell.  Is that true?  It is clothes.  Pat's not known for making a joke, so I'm assuming this is like the real deal.  Awful.  I was like as far as I am, like three feet away from him, and every time he would speak 
[00:08:00]  to me, I would just get so grossed out, and I could just smell him for hours afterwards.  Dude, he was talking to people not even near me.  Yeah.  And you could smell his breath everywhere.  Everywhere.  Unbelievable.  What a nervous Andrew.  He's got to do something.  Oh, do you have something about the...  Big A.  Oh, it is.  Big A.  Yes, I'm here.  What's up, Big A?  How did you feel about the taping yesterday? 
[00:08:30]  It's okay, not bad.  You might be a TV star now.  You know that, right?  Yeah, maybe.  How do you look with your eyebrows, guy?  We didn't take a picture.  We should have taken a picture so we could have put it up on onaradio.com.  Did you pencil eyebrows in?  Oh, no, no.  I should have sent the picture to Danny.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, where's the picture?  It's a wallet size.  He carries it with him.  All right.  Danny's got the picture. 
[00:09:00]  We'll put it up on the website.  But Big A, a lot of people, I know you don't like talking about this, but we have to bring  it up.  They really, really don't like your breath.  Yeah, maybe it's a tic-tac.  What was it, crap flavor?  I think you need to...  Wrigley's vomit gum? 
[00:09:30]  I think at this point you need to just pull all your teeth out there, Big A.  You need to pull out your teeth and scoop out the gums.  Get all that goop out of there and start over.  It's like freshening up when you bite it.  Garbage juice shoots out.  A shot of dumpster juice hits you in the back of the throat.  Big A, we're making fun of your breath.  Oh, Big A.  Oh, Big A.  You okay, Big A?  Oh, yes, sir. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Big A, you might have to get some floss in between the teeth.  That'll help.  Just something, I think, is going on.  Yeah.  What's up, Danny?  Well, Big A needs to resend me that photo because I think he thinks he sent an attachment  there was no attachment on his email.  Oh.  Resend me that photo, Big A.  Big A.  Andrew, what is it?  You get very nervous?  Is that what it is?  You get very nervous and your glands go kind of haywire?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I know I brush my teeth.  And I also use mouthwash.  Yeah, but you got to get in there with, like, dental floss or a little rope or something. 
[00:10:30]  And you got to scrape your tongue.  Oh, with a backhoe.  Yeah, with a backhoe.  Do you brush with a big brush that kind of stands up by the ball?  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry, Big A.  We're excited.  We're back live and haven't done radio in a while, so we figure we'll just pick on you.  We have to pick on somebody.  We haven't picked on people in a while.  It's hard to pick on people when you're not doing a radio show. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, you get punched.  They will actually punch you in the face.  Yeah.  Big A.  Yes?  All right, you got to scrape your tongue really, really good.  And the little scraper's going to smell like you.  Oh!  Oh, it's going to be awful.  But it'll help a lot.  And then you do a little dental floss.  Okay.  And maybe pull out a few of the rotten teeth in the back.  Is that what it is, you think?  You think he's got some rotters back there?  His teeth don't look like they're that bad.  When he does that creepy smile, the teeth look like they're okay. 
[00:11:30]  The teeth look all right.  Yeah.  Well, Big A, big TV star.  They were very happy with what you did yesterday.  Thank you.  And I apologize.  I tried to commit.  It was clean and all, but...  Also...  People are suggesting someone needs to drive a Zamboni over his tongue. 
[00:12:00]  Perhaps that would clean it up.  That's very good viral.  Maybe like just the salt you use in your driveway.  Yeah, just kind of lay it down.  Throw that on his tongue to kind of dissolve the crap.  How about...  Because, dude, I'm obsessed with trying to keep my mouth clean at this point.  Dental floss.  Look, I got dental picks.  I got everything.  Dental floss, toothpaste, mouthwash.  Gum.  I'm always poking, and I'm always...  It's the greatest breath I ever smelt, and I've smelt it all over the world. 
[00:12:30]  I'm also getting the latest elixirs that you kind of gargle with.  Elixir.  A million different ones, and...  Why the obsession?  You don't have bad breath.  Well, I think we all have a little...  I mean, a moment.  Oh, yeah.  Well, and then I...  Everybody has their moments, you know, yapping for hours on end.  And I couldn't get my mouth clean until a few years ago when I started really...  I went to town with the tongue scraper.  Oh, wow.  I can only imagine if Big A scraped his tongue for the first time.  Well, we should get someone to...  All right, Big A, Big A, if you're listening still, do not scrape your tongue. 
[00:13:00]  You're coming in either tomorrow or Friday.  No, no, I can't.  Pat Duffy, you in?  No.  Pat Duffy's in.  What's he got to do?  I know the perfect scraper to get.  It looks like a little spoon, and you go...  And by the time you're done, there's a scoop of goop.  And Pat Duffy will...  It's like butterscotch ice cream.  Yeah, Pat Duffy will take his medicine, right?  How about a breath goop ice cream?  A breath goop mustache.  I don't even know if I can't do that one, man. 
[00:13:30]  I would rather do the baby diaper mustache than the Big A tongue scraper mustache.  I like how we've fallen into this immediately within returning to the program.  Also, really fast, this whole Comedy Central thing, they had us taping from 10.30 in the  morning to like 9 o'clock at night.  We're all exhausted.  But Eastside Dave is going to be a star. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  He's an animal.  They all loved him.  He was an animal during this taping yesterday.  Because he'll do anything, whether he's asked to or not, whether it's needed for him to do  or not.  He'll just go out on the street and do anything.  Well, while they were shaving eyebrows, there was the water and the shaving cream goop.  And the hair stubble.  Right.  Eastside Dave, he couldn't wait anymore for what they wanted him to do, so he just started  chugging and chugging.  He was drinking. 
[00:14:30]  The concoction of hair, shaving cream.  And water.  And water.  And he did some other things.  And he had comics puking yesterday, Jimmy.  And not Bob Kelly, who we're used to having puke.  I guess Kelly wasn't in that scene.  I think Robinson may have gotten a little queasy.  Keith Robinson?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's something.  I can't even describe it.  There's something.  Just...  Yeah.  And then, what was the other thing I wanted to mention?  Oh, then Young Sam.  Sam.  Young Sam stepped up yesterday. 
[00:15:00]  Young Sam refuses to do anything for this radio show, but you throw a TV camera in front  of his face.  It's a different story.  He wants to be a TV star.  We have told Sam, do this.  He says no.  He says no more than anyone else on this staff.  What do you mean?  It's Comedy Central.  What do you mean?  Pilot.  You don't do anything.  What did you do for this TV project yesterday?  Tell Jimmy.  Jimmy has not heard this yet.  He's going to be very proud of you, by the way.  Yesterday, we found a gay, homeless, drunk man who I kissed on the lips twice. 
[00:15:30]  Look at Jimmy's face.  Why twice?  Because once for the bit and did you rehearse?  That's when we kind of do a cold run.  It was kismet.  I think we weren't happy with the first kiss.  And actually, Sam said, all right, I'll give you a good one.  Bob Kelly, in his infinite wisdom, decided we needed to do a second one.  And then, for whatever reason...  Bob was totally loving it, I bet. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, for whatever reason, then Bob Kelly grabbed me by the face and kissed me on the  lips, too.  Which I think was just something for him.  Something he'd wanted to do and probably needed an excuse.  Oh, yeah.  He's always talking about cherubish Sam and how he wants to do things to him.  Oh, it was terrible.  Yeah, but you left out something.  Oh, the homeless guy.  I heard that the homeless guy spent the morning in a glory hole.  He mentioned...  Well, he can't be in the actual glory hole, but he was doing stuff through a glory hole. 
[00:16:30]  He was on the other side of the glory hole.  See the recipient?  Yeah.  But you can't really be on the other side of a glory hole.  A glory hole is what it is.  It's like...  Well, you gotta be on the other side.  One guy's standing and one guy's tying his shoes.  Right.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah.  But supposedly, this guy bragged that that's what he was doing.  Not for a little while.  No.  He was doing this all morning.  All morning.  He had just come from two different glory holes.  And you kissed him on the mouth.  On his lips.  Twice. 
[00:17:00]  Twice.  He was chugging it, Sam.  Lifting guys up and chugging.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that horrible?  That was a hard one to break to the girlfriend.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially while she's packing and leaving.  I had to gargle with soap water.  Not like soap.  Like for your face.  Yeah, you did?  Yeah, I gargled with it.  Yeah, hours after the fact.  I know.  It doesn't matter.  Were you out there with Eastside Dave?  No.  Okay, he was with the other guys.  Wait, she made you gargle? 
[00:17:30]  No, but.  Well, kind of.  Listerine's better.  It's got alcohol in there.  We didn't have any Listerine, so I just.  Did you have any booze in the house or anything?  No.  No.  A fish stick?  Also, for the record, Pat from Munaki didn't shave his eyebrows.  Oh, he did?  We rolled him down the Union Square Park stairs.  Ah, right.  Because the other team had already shaved eyebrows.  Well, now you're saying there's teams involved with our show.  No, the other.  Interesting.  By team, I meant Big A.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Had already shaved his eyebrows.  Yes.  He's a big guy.  That's okay.  Homo.  So, I don't know.  Comedy Central seems really hot on this project.  We'll see if they pick it up.  Yeah, we'll see.  We filmed for like eight or nine hours, and now they have to make 22 minutes out of it  and then sell it to somebody.  Yeah.  We'll keep you informed.  We'll see if they pick that up.  It was fun.  It did go on forever.  Oh, my God.  But, yeah, it was fun.  It took us away from our radio show. 
[00:18:30]  We were supposed to be back on Monday.  I know.  A lot of things happened since we've been gone.  What?  I don't know.  Action.  How was your vacation, Anthony?  Very good.  Yeah?  Yes.  What'd you do?  Anything fun?  Really can't say.  What?  I just can't say.  Why?  I don't know.  Can I smell your belt?  No.  Let me see.  I got some electronics put in.  Why can't you say what you did?  That.  You're being a little too mysterious.  Mysterious? 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  I don't think I'm being mysterious.  You're being mysterious.  Why can't you say?  Can't really say.  It's just kind of hanging out.  I just kind of hung out.  That's all I did.  Just hung out.  Don't grill me on this, please.  How do you think you can keep this ruse up?  Are you insane?  It's not a ruse. 
[00:19:30]  It's not a ruse.  Give us one thing.  It's just, all right.  Why can't you tell us what you did on your vacation?  I got a big screen TV.  But that's not something you do on vacation.  It's very nice.  You said you can't talk about your vacation.  I'm having my pool guy came over.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But this is stuff you could talk about.  Yeah.  That's what I did.  Like vacation.  Because I didn't go on my normal vacation that I've been going on for years and years,  which is either a cruise or, you know, down to the Bahamas or something like that. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  So I just, I found myself at a loss of what to do.  So I decided, meh, I'll just, you know, cruise around a little bit.  I sang karaoke.  You did?  Yeah.  A little karaoke.  So you, I'm not a gigolo.  Jiminy Cricket.  No, I didn't get married. 
[00:20:30]  I love how Anthony thinks no one is on to him whatsoever.  What?  I didn't say no one's on to me as far as whatever on to me means.  What I'm saying is, you might have a great poker face when it comes to playing cards,  but when it comes to your personal life, who are you kidding?  Yes, Jimmy.  Did you take one of those, did you take a special trip to like Taiwan?  No, I didn't go to Taiwan.  Yes, I went to Indochina, to some Southeast Asian nation and had fun with little lads. 
[00:21:00]  I love when he comes to him.  I, uh, I, I took a trip to the Caribbean and, uh, Turks and Caicos.  Ah!  See, look.  How was it?  Look, that was my vacation.  Oh, that's nice.  What'd you do?  I went down there.  I didn't do much of anything.  I laid around on a beach.  Took a lot of.  That sounds nice.  Took a lot of walks.  Took a lot of swims.  Had a few drinks.  That's good.  Very, very mellow.  That sounds fun.  That's what I did on vacation. 
[00:21:30]  Now, Anthony, once again, what did you do on vacation?  What?  We were off for, like, almost two weeks.  You bought a big flat-screen TV?  Uh, you gotta give us something.  Jimmy, what did you do on vacation?  I said I did some karaoke.  I went away with Anthony.  All right, the cat's out of the bag.  Alternative.  And so is Jimmy.  Alternative Life Radio.  I just stayed in town.  You did?  Yeah, I had stuff.  You did spots and stuff?  Yeah, I did.  See? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  See, not everybody just does these wild things like,  We're running off to the Caribbean.  You know?  Just hang out.  I ain't got nobody.  Good luck.  Nobody cares for me.  Nobody.  Nobody.  So you don't want to share?  What's there to share?  It's just, um, you know.  We were off for 12 days, I think. 
[00:22:30]  11 days.  Yeah.  You bought a large flat screen TV.  Yeah.  And sang karaoke.  And sang a little karaoke.  A lot of hours you're missing in there.  A lot of hours.  There was a lot of karaoke.  Sang some karaoke.  I saw some fans.  I'd imagine in 11 or 12 days you could do maybe two or three hours of karaoke.  That leaves a lot of hours, my friend.  All right.  Let me think.  What else?  All right.  Slept. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  It was nice to be able to not have to wake up at an ungodly hour.  All right.  Even if I give you 10 hours of sleeping a day.  10 hours a day.  There's still a lot of hours that are unaccounted for.  Let me think.  Anything else I could really sleep?  There you go.  There you go.  Okay.  Big screen TV.  No, that's about it.  You know this house of cards you're like building? 
[00:23:30]  What?  House of cards.  You do know that.  What?  Eventually the whole thing comes tumbling down.  I know.  I know it does.  All right.  Can I just have this moment?  That's all I'm saying.  Where it's just still standing and there's no breeze yet.  You might want to try some crazy glue on the cards because this house of cards is getting  a little too high.  Well, look. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  I guess you did nothing.  I just kind of hung out.  Yeah.  That's all.  What's wrong with that?  Jimmy, why aren't you grilling them?  Tell me out here.  Because I don't know what to ask him.  See?  All I want to know is if he uses Magnums.  I just want to know.  That's all I care about is what he's packing.  What are those?  We have to pack.  Could be better.  Exactly. 
[00:24:30]  Those pesky things away.  Absolutely.  I could take one off with a pinky and no one will know.  You always got to do a little pinky thing on the downstroke.  That thing comes right off.  Hey, screw it.  How many years do I really have left?  Yeah.  You know what?  It starts to look like as it comes undone, it starts to look like the night before Christmas.  Who's that dude with his stocking cap on?  With his stocking cap. 
[00:25:00]  Have a teaser?  Have a teaser Scrooge?  Have a teaser Scrooge's little Christmas hat.  That's what it looks like.  Before it just comes off completely and it's lost in the sheets.  Oh, and the ridge is holding it for as long as it can.  When you stand it, if it's upside down, it looks like a big feed bag.  Oh, God. 
[00:25:30]  Let's get rid of Snuffleupagus.  Humping around?  Huh?  Why?  I wasn't saying that at all.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Yeah, hey, Ann.  Hey.  How come you're saying you just hung around and Keith the cop called Ron and Pheasant said  you were out touring the country?  What?  Oh, no.  Another clue.  Wait.  First of all, Keith wouldn't sell me out. 
[00:26:00]  Keith is not a true soldier like Club Soda Kenny.  Keith wouldn't sell me out.  I can't get anything from Club Soda Kenny.  Oh.  He said he was at your house while stuff was being installed.  So Keith was at your house and you were touring the country.  Well, Keith.  I mean, if this was on another radio show, then it's, you know.  Fair game.  It has to be fair game.  Keith was at my house because I'm having all kinds of electronics and things installed  and whatnot and the house is being decorated and designed and I got the pool thing happening. 
[00:26:30]  So I need somebody there to supervise and Keith is the guy for the job.  And you couldn't be there because you were in the middle of a dance marathon at a local  high school.  No, I wasn't.  I was, I don't know what he means, touring the country.  I wasn't touring the country.  I was just on vacation.  So what's the problem?  Did you take any trips? 
[00:27:00]  Like, did you have to, let's just say that.  Did you go to a place where you had to either get a ride to or park your car for a few days?  Oh, no, not necessarily.  All I ask when this huge, big, tall house of cards comes tumbling down that you finally  open up and share.  Uh-huh.  Because you got a story to tell, my friend.  Well, perhaps a book. 
[00:27:30]  You got a story to tell.  Look.  All in due time.  I, uh, I'm not used, let's just say, uh, I'm not used to taking vacations, um, uh, alone.  That's all.  I've usually, for years, I've been in a relationship and, uh, uh, would go on vacations together  and whatnot.  And, uh, this time is the first time of vacation where I am a single gentleman. 
[00:28:00]  Um, so perhaps.  So you're trying to say that you were alone on vacation?  I was, uh, uh, let me think how I could say that.  I was, um, I spent some alone time.  Is that, is that, is that good?  Did you really?  Oh, now there's Anthony's spottings?  Yeah.  There's Anthony's spottings?  Where's the Anthony, uh, oh, uh, Paul in New York. 
[00:28:30]  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey there, Paul.  I'm doing good.  How you doing?  Yeah.  What's up?  Uh, no, I just got back from, uh, Las Vegas and then we, uh, me and my friends actually  built me so Anthony there, dropping some money with, uh, with a couple of girls.  Vegas with a couple of girls dropping some cash.  Were you in Vegas?  Um, I really don't think I was in Vegas.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, ladies.  How are you?  Pretty good.  What's up, bro?  Ladies, that's funny. 
[00:29:00]  Anthony, is it true your favorite karaoke song is Sugar Mountain by Neil Young?  You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain.  Yeah, that's what I call it.  Sugar Mountain.  I got the joke, Chris.  Very good.  Uh, hey, uh, this morning, uh, we got breakfast courtesy of, uh, Quick Check.  Want to thank them for the fine, fresh food that's sitting over there welcoming us back  to the, uh, to the radio show.  All right.  You have to find people at Quick Check.  Absolutely.  We got to take our first break. 
[00:29:30]  Yes, Jimmy?  I had one of those cookies.  Yeah.  And do you have any idea how badly I want to go back and eat more of them?  Yes.  They were really fantastic.  But you're trying to get yourself back into shape.  Doesn't matter.  No?  It's the breakfast is final.  Burn it off.  A little sugar's good in the morning.  Knock it right off.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Just getting started.  We got a very busy show.  Uh, Ben Mesrick is coming in studio to talk about the new movie, 21.  It should be called Bringing Down the House because that's, uh, that was the book he wrote 
[00:30:00]  that was huge.  Uh, a New York Times bestseller, but he didn't want it to be confused with that other dumb movie  that came out.  Well, it sounds like one of those, uh, like a black movie, Bringing Down the House.  Right.  But it was about Bringing Down Vegas, Bringing Down the House, but he had to change the name  of the movie, which is going to star, uh, Kevin Spacey, to 21.  So he's going to talk about that today.  Short and sweet.  Dude, we got Rampage Jackson coming in studio.  That guy.  Is he in today?  Yes.  Rampage.  He came in about, I don't know, four or five months ago.  He gave us great radio.  We're excited to see him, uh, in studio today. 
[00:30:30]  Also, Triple H talking about WrestleMania, uh, an old friend of the show.  We haven't seen him live in studio in years.  And he's coming in?  Yeah, he's coming in.  Jeez.  Very cool.  What a day.  And then some, some loser later on will be calling our show who gives a crap.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  First time live in about a week and a half.  Uh, took a week vacation.  And then we did a, uh, a pilot for Comedy Central the last two days. 
[00:31:00]  That's why we're, we're starting back up in the middle of a week here.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  But, uh, we figured it was a way to get a couple more days off from the radio show.  Uh, yeah, quite frankly.  I was ready to just BS the audience.  I'm like, you know what?  Let's tell it like it is.  We could have easily done our radio show and take this thing for Comedy Central.  But, uh, we knew we could get away with, uh, taking a couple extra days.  Hey, man, we're just like the people listening here, right?  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  We want to get off as, uh, as much as possible.  Also, uh, we're getting really close, but the ONA Animation Festival.  We started hinting about this.  We started talking about this before the break.  We are going to have an all-out animation festival.  Uh, oh, we definitely got the date.  Okay, Thursday, June 5th.  It is definitely going to go down.  The ONA Animation Festival.  Write that down.  We're talking celebrities.  We're talking red carpet.  We're talking comedians.  It's going to be a gala event. 
[00:32:00]  Absolutely.  An animation from all our listeners.  Uh, we got, uh, we got some fine cash prizes.  We got, uh, tickets that are going to go, uh, on sale at Ticketmaster sometime in April,  first week of April.  Mm-hmm.  I think by Friday we're going to have all the details.  Uh, we're letting two venues fight it out because they both want it.  What day is, uh, is that?  Uh, Thursday.  Oh, it's a Thursday?  So we will be off Friday, June 6th.  Take note.  Now. 
[00:32:30]  Uh.  And we're trying to keep this as a cheap ticket.  So far we got it down to, uh, $10 with a $5 service charge.  My God, man.  What?  My God, man.  Should be like Eddie Vedder.  If you want to be involved in the animation festival, you can pretty much take any clip  from this radio show from all the years we've been doing radio and animate the hell out  of it.  Yeah.  Uh, we'll also give you some, um, audio clips that you can choose from.  Up on the website that we cannot promote that is named after this fine radio show.  And you can also go to odaradio.com for details on the first annual. 
[00:33:00]  Doesn't, first annual, does that make sense?  Uh, I think so if you're anticipating more, sure.  Yeah, if we plan on doing any more.  I think we should do this every year.  So the first annual O&A Animation Festival, more details by the end of the week.  Okay.  Uh, and, uh, we're trying to figure out what Anthony did on vacation and he's not budging  here.  Well, I, I budged.  I, I really kind of spelled it all out.  Did you?  Yeah.  I, uh, I, uh, I got, uh, big TV, um, and, uh, I did some karaoke and you had some of 
[00:33:30]  that experimental surgery.  What?  That's what you said, right?  No.  Oh, that's what someone's saying on, uh, are you pregnant?  Like that guy on TV?  What?  Man says he's preggers.  No, I'm not pregnant.  I had no surgery.  Um, there is a guy and they're taking it pretty damn serious that, uh, he's saying he's pregnant.  Robert Kelly, hopey against hope, but it's not just eating disorder. 
[00:34:00]  You know, we, uh, we missed a big week too, man.  The governor of New York.  Holy geez.  The one, the one that left or the one that's in there now?  Because they're both just hysterical.  Well, let's, uh, bring everyone up to date.  Elliot Spitzer, you know, he got caught in that, uh, that prostitution thing.  Little prostitution ring sting action.  And we learned over the break that he likes to have sex with his black socks on.  Pulled all the way up to his knees.  But the New York Post, New York Post, a bunch of scums, uh, I don't know if you can say the  other word, but a bunch of scums, the headline was Elliot Spitzer likes to keep his stockings 
[00:34:30]  on.  So they made it kind of look like he, he might be wearing some women's stuff.  Oh, I gotcha.  And then you had to read the article to see that it was actually his black socks.  Yeah.  Did he have those old garters on too, holding them up?  So he couldn't wait.  He probably couldn't even get his pants off faster.  As soon as that young piece walked in the room, his socks were on, his shoes were on,  his pants were at his ankles.  Did that stupid smile of his and just jumped on the bed?  And also, one of the madams said that he liked to pay to watch other couples have sex. 
[00:35:00]  So the Post prints this story.  And then the madam was back in the paper going, that's, I didn't say that.  No?  But the Post took kind of, sort of what she said and just went with it.  Yeah, might as well.  So anyway, we lose Elliot Spitzer.  We get this guy who's, he's black.  He's blind.  It's key to say he's black because he's the first, what, black?  Governor.  Governor of New York State.  Yeah.  So he's black and he's blind.  And wow, that hasn't slowed him down.  Nope.  This guy likes effing. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Turns out he was having affairs.  Him and his wife admitted that they had, what, a rocky little road there?  Yeah, they were trying to say that they had this little rough spot in their marriage where  they both went off and had relationships with other people.  But it turns out that very recently, during one of these Hillary Clinton campaign things,  he's darting off to this event with his old girlfriend. 
[00:36:00]  His old squee.  That he was cheating on his wife with.  Yeah.  And they're saying, no, no, this is just because he's blind and needs somebody to lead him around.  By his love.  You know what?  Exactly.  Doing the old elephant walk.  Follow me.  Tug him around.  Follow me, governor.  Tie a dental floss to it.  Come on.  Giddy up.  But, oh, this guy is a hoot.  I was reading the paper today and someone, I think it was in the editorial section, just  wrote an article saying, shut your mouth and just start governing the state. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  You don't have to spill the beans.  Stop admitting to everything.  He's so, he's being so preemptive that he's just spilling everything he's ever done and  not doing the work of the governor.  He's so afraid that the press is going to find this stuff out and make it a big scandal that  he thinks it's best if he just gets it out there immediately.  Did he do Coke, too?  He said he did.  Yeah, yeah.  There's cocaine.  He's like, I did Coke.  I did pot.  I like whores.  I'm just, I'm out there.  And he's like, look, you know, a lot of people out there did a lot worse than I did. 
[00:37:00]  Honestly, I don't give a crap if our politicians smoked a little weed or did a little Coke  because pretty much everyone has.  Yeah.  The majority of Americans have tried Coke and marijuana at this point.  I love how we all make believe we haven't tried this stuff.  I think he should be thrown out for his awful wedding photo.  That picture where he's just looking off into the distance.  His wife, his wife is looking at the camera and he's looking, I don't know, off at the  priest.  He looks like Abdul-Jabbar, but as a midget.  What a creep he looks like. 
[00:37:30]  He looks like Abdul-Jabbar when Abdul-Jabbar was Lew Alcindor.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  When he was playing with the Milwaukee Bucks, if you really want to go with this bit.  Why couldn't his girlfriend or his wife take his head and go, look this way, idiot?  Just turn your head the right way.  The photographers just went, yo, here.  Maybe they did.  Maybe he was actually facing the back wall.  That's as close as they can get him.  Yeah.  I'd like to see the other pictures that they didn't take.  I would just tell the governor, listen for the whistle.  Yeah.  Just look.  I'm going to be taking your picture. 
[00:38:00]  Just listen for the whistle.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Oh, I look over here.  So, I don't know.  What's going to happen with this guy?  Is he safe?  I think because the Spitzer thing was so huge that this guy really would have to have done  something bad.  I think he's all right.  I think he'll be safe.  Yeah.  But, oh, God, here's a picture of Big A with his eyebrows shaved off.  This is horrible.  Oh, my God.  We were talking about this earlier for our little show we filmed for Comedy Central yesterday. 
[00:38:30]  We'll see if they pick it up a little, what's called a pilot.  We did shave Big A's eyebrows, and look at that picture.  That will be up on onaradio.com later today.  This is a frightening picture.  This looks like a picture that is put up.  They have to catch this guy immediately because of an amber alert.  Yeah.  Wow.  Creep.  Anyway.  A ghoul.  So, you think the governor stays?  Yeah, I think he'll skate, probably. 
[00:39:00]  And it might be, you know, we are a very guilt-ridden nation.  It might be because of his race or his handicap.  They'll be a little more lenient with him than if it was just, you know, a stupid white guy  in there that did coke and cheated on his wife.  And I don't know what else is coming out about him.  But we'll see.  I think he's all right, though.  He's blind.  He could say he didn't know it was coke.  He thought it was an antihistamine.  He had a cold.  I was a little stuffy.  I didn't know.  They told me it was afferent.  I stayed up for a week and built a house. 
[00:39:30]  Let's go to Matt.  Hey, Matt.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Just thought I'd say hey.  We had a good time on the weekend, eh?  Who?  We were singing karaoke up at the restaurant there.  Where?  And it wasn't up in New York.  So, I'm not going to give it away, Anthony, because it was really fun and we had a good  time.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  What did I sing?  Uh, there was too many for me to remember. 
[00:40:00]  It was a nonstop karaoke fest.  Wait.  You were doing karaoke out of state?  Uh, it might have been.  I don't think it was really.  Well, I don't know, Anthony.  I'm not going to go there, man.  Wow.  This guy's okay.  He's being a good egg.  But I think he was there.  Wait.  So, Matt.  I'm not going to give you up.  Matt actually saw Ant doing karaoke.  Is it fair to say that it was off Long Island?  Let's just go with that.  Does it sound like I'm from New York, Long Island?  Nope.  Oh, wow.  There you go. 
[00:40:30]  He sounds like he might be from another country.  What the hell did you do on vacation, Ant?  And why is your iPhone going nuts right now?  No, it's not.  I'm being, I'm just, well, Matt was a good boy.  Matt doesn't give people up.  That's nice.  You're a good egg, Matt.  Let's go to John in New York.  John?  I heard Anthony spend a lot of time at his health club.  I believe it's called the Emperor's Club.  The Emperor's Club.  Stupid Elliot Spitzer gets that place shut down. 
[00:41:00]  Not only that place, now they've decided to shut down all of them.  Yeah.  Another one got shut down.  All the high ends.  All the high ends are getting shut down.  See, I'd have been a high-end guy.  Let's say hi to Wes, the trucker.  Wes?  Hey, I spotted Anthony this weekend down in D.C.  singing karaoke with knee-high socks on at the Mayflower.  I can assure you I was not at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C.  All right.  How about Cool Circus from Long Island? 
[00:41:30]  Cool Circus.  Hey, Ant, I was wondering if on your vacation you ran into Dennis Hoff.  How's he doing?  How's Dennis Hoff doing?  Why would I run into Dennis Hoff?  I would, I don't pay for it, my friend.  I don't pay for women or men.  Ant doesn't have to pay for it.  He has a radio show.  Young boys, I'll pay for it.  Of course.  You don't have to pay for it if you have a radio show. 
[00:42:00]  That's right.  Right, Ant?  That's right.  Right?  Huh?  Pay for it.  I actually saw Dennis Hoff.  Did you?  I didn't talk to him.  I went to talk to him when he was gone.  At a UCB show that Amy Poehler does.  It was very funny.  Very cool.  Would you be hanging out, talking to you if you were him?  No.  You'd just go back there and bang all your broads that you own?  He had his one regular.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Okay.  Speaking of vacation, we love to do a bit called Unlucky Lottery or Sucks to Be You.  Yeah.  Very confusing. 
[00:42:30]  Did you hear about this story?  No, I didn't.  Oh, my God.  I have to make a verdict.  It freaked the hell out of me.  Listen to what happened to this lady.  And just imagine in your head the odds.  Seriously, try to do a little math in your head as you listen to this story.  A freak accident off the waters of the Florida Keys.  Judy Zagorski was out on the waters Thursday in this rented 16-foot fishing boat with her family.  That's when this large, spotted eagle ray jumped out of the water, striking the 55-year-old head-on. 
[00:43:00]  It collided with the victim at a very intense force, causing the victim to fall backwards.  The sister that was on board immediately ran to her aid and attempted to do CPR.  But by all intents and purposes, she was probably already deceased.  Wow.  The fish wins.  The fish wins.  Hey, man, I don't know about you, but the fish are starting to get pissed off.  They really are getting aggravated. 
[00:43:30]  We don't want to be eaten anymore.  Enough.  Enough.  Go back to chicken.  What kind of fish was that?  Like a something ray?  It wasn't like a stingray.  It was a ray?  It was a ray.  It wasn't a...  I don't think it was a stingray.  I think it was...  They said what kind of ray.  But they all look...  It was in the ray family.  They kind of looked the same.  They got the little wings and everything.  It's called a spotted eagle ray.  A spotted eagle ray.  It's...  They're so much bigger than regular stingrays.  Oh, my God.  That's why that this lady died.  It wasn't just like a little one-foot thing. 
[00:44:00]  This thing just came out of a monster.  It weighed 75 pounds and had like a six-foot wingspan.  Oh, God.  She got killed by an oversized water bat.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  She was killed by a sea monster.  Yeah.  A sea monster came out and killed her.  It's a monster.  At least when you go to heaven, man.  You got a story to tell.  Oh, listen.  Beat this one.  Wait.  Was she just...  The boat was going and this thing just happened to jump in.  Wow. 
[00:44:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  And the momentum.  Yes.  That's unlucky lottery.  The boat is just tooling along.  This thing decides to fly out of the water.  Is this one of those things that has to jump out of the water every once in a while, I guess?  No.  I mean, not to my knowledge anyway.  This, I think, was just like a complete freak accident.  Yeah.  Those things don't usually...  They usually hang out at the bottom.  More to the story.  Wow.  The ray, five to six feet in wingspan, weighing 75 to 80 pounds, was also killed instantly.  Zagorski was declared dead here at Fisherman's Hospital in Marathon. 
[00:45:00]  And the fish was declared dead at Human's Hospital.  That's terrible.  Poor little fish.  It is also where her 88-year-old father was held briefly for observation.  He was on the boat when it happened.  Spotted eagle rays are not stingrays.  They're known to jump out of the water.  Like stingrays, they have a sharp barb.  That can be lethal.  However, investigators don't believe that's what happened here.  Because of the fact that she was bleeding quite a bit. 
[00:45:30]  But after the further investigation, our investigators determined that there was no visible puncture wounds on the body.  She just got slammed with 75 pounds of meat.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  75 pounds of meat hit her in the face.  You can't imagine this one.  Did she see it coming, though?  No.  Hopefully looking the other way.  Hopefully she wasn't like, large thing, looks slippery.  No time to duck.  Smells like fish. 
[00:46:00]  I'm floating above, looking down at my dumb father, feeling a giant sea serpent on my face.  What happened?  Looking down at my dumb father.  He's thinking he's got Alzheimer's because he doesn't understand what just happened.  No, he's remembering my prom.  My father's remembering my prom and the bright future.  And he never thought he'd be peeling a sea monster off my face on a boat.  And that's how I would die.  Who would ever guess that way?  She probably took good care of herself.  Oh, yeah, right.  She was breast cancer exams and probably ate healthy and knew what she had to do. 
[00:46:30]  She's out boating, just having fun.  Sea air.  Being a little active.  And you end up getting killed by a water bath.  A damn monster flings itself out of the water into your head.  How do you think it feels, too?  It survives.  It avoids sharks.  It avoids, like, being sucked into a whale's mouth.  And it's killed by someone wearing, like, jeans that don't fit properly.  The last thing it smells is denture breath and fear.  Coffee.  Awful denture coffee breath.  Oh, wow. 
[00:47:00]  That's a, yeah, that's an unlucky lottery story.  It's got to be.  If they're known to jump out of the water, it's not like it was jumping into the boat.  It was probably just jumping out of the water.  And I know I missed, the boat was moving, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was.  Moving pretty good.  So that kind of, yeah, that kind of added to it, I'm sure.  Well, I think getting hit in the face with 75 pounds, no matter what speed you're traveling at,  it's going to be pretty traumatic.  It doesn't matter what the hell, how fast you're going.  I think there'd be a play with this story. 
[00:47:30]  It sounds like she lost her head or close to it.  Wow.  I think this thing just destroyed her.  There's a lot of blood.  They said there was a lot of blood.  All right, we got to take a break.  After that cute little story, we got to take a little break.  Her face went right into its guts.  Like, her face, its body probably smashed.  Oh, it probably did smash and just make a big splat sound, both of them together.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right.  Other things, other things.  A lot of stuff happened over the break.  World's tallest man struggles to fit in. 
[00:48:00]  We'll get into that.  I love that big Russian dude.  He's great.  Eight foot five.  All right, we'll get into that after the break, because it's one of our favorite bits  to talk about these freaks.  And modern day elephant man transformed by full face transplant.  Full face transplant.  And then you got the Detroit mayor arraigned in sex text messaging scandal.  That's a terrific story.  Study shows the best marriages are between hot women and ugly men.  Of course, who would argue?  No matter what she says, you're like, all right. 
[00:48:30]  There's never an argument to be had.  She's like, just hold my purse at the mall and I'll bang you.  Fine.  Can I buy you some tampons?  I'll go in.  You stay here in the car.  And other things.  We got a lot of catching up to do.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  La, la, la.  Are we back?  Bam, bam.  I don't know.  Something's not playing.  We need music.  There you go.  The whole show falls apart if we don't have our music when we come back from break. 
[00:49:00]  We don't know what to do.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, who's been traveling around the country since we last spoke.  Right, Jimmy?  Doing that comedy thing.  And what happened in, you got a story or something?  By the way, the Denver and Minneapolis fans, two places I've, I've performed in Denver once  in Denver and Minneapolis.  Complete savages.  Nice.  Like the other fans in the country.  It was great.  Fantastic.  Yeah, two of the best road gigs I've ever had.  Of course they don't, of course they love this show in Denver.  They don't get enough air out there.  Yeah, they really love.  Oh, they're starving for oxygen. 
[00:49:30]  Are you saying that?  Starved for oxygen and entertainment, obviously.  We had, I don't know.  That's a stupid joke.  In Minnesota, on the hotel they told us that Bruce Springsteen was staying at our hotel.  Yeah.  And, you know, on a much higher floor, I'm sure.  So I didn't see him at all.  So, and as we're leaving for my gig, there was a guy outside this black truck and he  goes, hey, Jimmy.  And I go, hello, sir.  And then Kenny goes, Bruce was in the truck.  Apparently this guy was Bruce's driver or whatever. 
[00:50:00]  So me and Kenny walked in my car and we're looking in the rearview mirror and I see Springsteen  sitting in the passenger seat on a cell phone.  Murray Springsteen?  Murray Springsteen, great uncle of Bruce and a great inspiration for so many of those New  Jersey stories that he tells.  Because Bruce's father wanted to move to Connecticut and Murray said, stay.  Stay.  So it's, so we're driving away and I'm like, I'm looking, we're at a red light.  Sure.  I'm looking at a half block behind me. 
[00:50:30]  I'm like, that's Springsteen.  Why am I not going?  I'm like, Kenny, let's try it.  Why am I not stalking him?  Bruce gets out of the truck and he signs an album for someone.  Me and Kenny run a half a block back towards my own hotel.  We run into the lobby and Kenny's like, oh, I guess he beat us.  The elevator's closed.  I'm like, no, it's not.  I see the elevator open.  Me and Kenny burst onto the elevator and there is Springsteen and his guy and just me and  Kenny and they hit their floor and me and Kenny just kind of stand.  And Kenny is such an awful actor.  He's like, uh, Jim, we got, he's like looking like he's looking for the floor to hit. 
[00:51:00]  He's like, we got to make this quick.  And I'm like holding a camera.  Look at a Springsteen.  I'm like, the gig's up idiot.  Yeah.  He's on to us.  So I'm like, uh, can I have a picture, Bruce?  And he goes, yeah, sure, man.  And was Clarence on the elevator too?  Oh, sorry.  I just heard you say something.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  But maybe he hit one of the upper floors.  So, um, so, uh, it was very awkward because it was, uh, so of course I gave the camera 
[00:51:30]  and his guy actually took the picture and he puts his arm around me in the elevator.  And as we're going up, uh, Kenny's just trying to act like we meant to get on the elevator.  And he was very nice.  And we took the picture and wrote all 15 floors with him.  He goes, all right, guys, this is my floor.  And we're like, all right.  And then he gets off and we realize we haven't hit a floor.  So we just ran onto the elevator.  Oh, no.  And tried to look casual.  I'm 40 years old.  I'm holding a camera and I got my shot.  Not the greatest story.  How annoyed would he have been if you hit every floor between where you are and his floor 
[00:52:00]  just to be on the elevator with him longer?  It was so uncomfortable.  When dumb kids, you had to hit the, use the card to swipe to hit a floor.  Yeah.  And watching Kenny try to improv and go, we got to be quick, Jim.  We got to be quick.  It's like the camera's out, dummy.  We got on this elevator to go upstairs.  And it's like, Kenny, could you stop, UCB members, stop improv-ing.  I got the camera out.  Bruce is right here.  Why don't you wait until he gets off?  And then we can improv going to my room.  Did you just reference Upright Citizen? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, well, because I went and saw him to the show.  That's the only improv reference I can make.  I got it.  I got to be honest.  I'm not an improv fan.  I got it.  Hilariously funny.  The shot of Springsteen, he's got his arm around you like, you're buds, man.  Yeah, he was actually surprisingly down to earth.  He was very cool.  We'll put that picture up on onaradio.com with the picture of Big A without the eyebrows.  Did you do anything like, hey, Jim Norton or a comic?  No, his guy knew me, though.  His whoever he knew was.  No, really?  Yeah, because he had said hi to me when I walked out the door.  Oh, that's good.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[00:53:00]  And I don't know if that was Bruce's guy or if he was a local cop, but he was, whoever  that guy is, I want to hug you.  Wow.  And then I had another celebrity encounter.  It's the worst story ever told.  It makes this dumb story I just told look like I survived a plane wreck story and interesting.  Jimmy, we just went out for sushi.  Jimmy, what's the big deal?  Oh.  All right, you're right.  But no, you remember you ordered the spider roll and I got the California roll and they  mixed it up.  I'm like, oh, I think I got yours.  And you're like, oh.  That's great.  Who got what roll? 
[00:53:30]  Thanks for trying to help that awful, awful joke.  Thank you.  I figure I was in the tub.  You jumped in with a toaster.  We're both going down.  There you go.  Got hit in the face with a ray.  What's the other one, Jimmy?  I was out and I was in a store and I was-  Oh, congrats.  It's about time.  Yes.  That was actually damn good.  I was walking to get a cab and I get in the cab and Bruce Willis gets out of the cab.  Oh. 
[00:54:00]  It's a Bruce weekend.  Yeah.  Bruce Willis gets out with one of the hottest chicks I've ever seen and I go, hey.  And he ignores me.  Oh.  And I get in his cab and that's the whole story.  And I wanted to tell someone so bad.  So I call my dumb girlfriend and I'm trying to-  As I'm telling her, I'm like, yeah, it's funny, you know.  And I realize it's not funny.  There's nothing there.  There's nothing there.  So I'm like, yeah, I get out of a cab.  I mean, Bruce Willis gets out and I got in and she's like, yeah? 
[00:54:30]  So what are you eating?  You hungry?  You want to do something?  That was the whole story.  That was nothing.  That was it.  Oh, that's an awful story.  It's the worst celebrity story.  That's horrid.  No, it's one of the better ones.  I wanted to be there.  It's like there was a smell on the seat.  Nothing.  Something.  He ignored you on purpose or didn't hear you?  I didn't even know if he heard me because I couldn't go, hey, Bruce.  I was so nervous.  Yeah.  I was like, hey.  Hey.  I made a noise.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I could have just walked by and went. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, is that a picture of him and his brood?  And his brood.  Very nice.  Okay.  Hey, moving on.  Baseball season is upon us.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  They're finally waking up because the Red Sox played in the, I don't know where they played.  In Japan.  Japan.  They won.  The game was over like, I don't know, 4.30 in the morning.  Some ridiculous time.  But, you know, I have to admit that, you know, I was following the Patriots.  I want the Celtics. 
[00:55:30]  Mm-hmm.  But I have to admit that I am a Mets fan.  And our boy, Ralph Kiner, is getting old here in New York.  Ralph Kiner.  And Danny noticed yesterday while he was watching the Mets game that Kiner should just retire.  He should not be doing play-by-play anymore.  I guess at this point he's doing, like, guest appearances during the game.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't have it in him to do the whole game anymore, so they kind of throw him in there for an inning or two, I think. 
[00:56:00]  He was all effed up when he used to do Kiner's Corner.  Oh, yeah.  It was some show that would come on after the Mets games, and it was like the little wrap-up show.  Well, it was known that these guys like to, you know, tip back a few in the booth.  Yeah, of course.  Well, we don't know if he's, I think this is just old.  No, I think this is old and tipping back a few.  Yeah.  Just because you get old, you don't stop drinking.  No.  Makes for an interesting combination, though.  So, Danny pulled a couple clips of Ralph Kiner doing the Mets game yesterday. 
[00:56:30]  Listen to this.  One of the reasons why a hitter will swing at the first pitch, he's afraid to get down to two strikes.  One of the reasons he'd get down to two strikes.  Okay.  What he's saying is all right.  It's just how he's saying it.  He's slurring his way.  Yeah, he's a little slurry.  Well, you have to learn to lay off the pitches, and that takes a lot of work.  And one of the things that the Mets have worked on with Rayo's short is his pitch selection. 
[00:57:00]  And getting balls that he can hit on the ground and hit and try and beat the ball out.  And he has too many fly balls.  It's Keith and I were talking about it earlier.  Too many fly balls for outs.  He has a little Dick Clark in him.  There's something going on.  There's something going on.  Yeah, he's a little slurry.  Well, Stephen S. from Bayshore, he's back, and he's writing for us once again on Instant Feedback. 
[00:57:30]  He writes, soon he'll be watching the new segment, Kiner's Coffin.  What's next for David Wright?  Pretty nothing but success.  The one thing about David Wright, he's working on things that he knows he has to improve.  And when you think that way, you're going to get better.  And he has got the ability to be able to change the route and try different things. 
[00:58:00]  One of the things you see right here in the defense of the game is that they're playing very shallow.  Something they wouldn't do without that wind blowing in.  There's a lot of power to work.  You know, Ralph Kiner's a legend.  Yeah.  Someone's got to sit him down and go, look, bro, it's over.  Get off the sauce.  I think he's old.  I think it's just that he's old.  You think it's just old?  Danny, old or drunk.  Or drunk.  Let's play old or drunk.  I'm going to go with old, and his tolerance probably isn't what it was. 
[00:58:30]  So he probably had like a beer, and he's feeling it real good.  So that with the old combo is not working well for him.  Old and drunk.  Is anyone acknowledging alongside him that he doesn't sound quite right?  No, but what they would do is sometimes on really rambly speeches,  like that, he would end, and they just really didn't know what to say to him.  So they would just go back to calling the game all awkwardly,  like, all right, three and two.  All right, Redding's an ass.  Why? 
[00:59:00]  Ralph Kiner sounds like WNEW Anthony.  All right, I had my days on that program.  He's thinking all the time.  He's working all the time.  Oh, my God.  Someone is telling us he has Bill's palsy.  Oh, does he?  We're trying to have a little fun here.  My God.  With that half a saggy face thing.  Is that true?  Chuck, what's going on?  Yeah, man, it's true.  I'm a lifelong meth fan, and I used to think about Kiner all the time.  He would just slur and stumble through whatever he was saying. 
[00:59:30]  I used to yell at the TV, have another drink, Ralph.  And then, like, about four or five years ago, they said, you know,  he was diagnosed with Bill's palsy, man.  He really should just hang it up.  He's embarrassing himself.  I don't understand this whole TV thing.  Like, if you get Bill's palsy in your job, you are so fired.  They don't want to deal with some dude with a saggy face.  You're done.  Saggy face guy.  Especially if you're, like, one of these people that are interacting with the public. 
[01:00:00]  But if you're on TV, you could have all sorts of crazy afflictions.  Like, ah, just get out there in front of the camera.  Put him on.  Put him on.  We don't care.  Yeah.  I mean, we all heard the Dick Clark thing.  Now we got to get the Dick Clark.  Oh, we got the Dick Clark audio?  Despite a bout with Bill's palsy, which left him slightly slurred speech,  Kiner is still broadcasting, entering his 45th year of doing this broadcast.  Wow.  He's been doing broadcast since Anthony was five years old.  Hey.  That's not even close. 
[01:00:30]  What?  That you do that.  You have to continue to try and do things and test out.  Probably the greatest example in the world is the best golfer that's playing golf right now  is Tiger Woods.  He's constantly changing his swing to find out one that works a little bit better  than the one that didn't work as well the last time we played.  I mean, you've got to really think about this game.  This is a game of thinking.  Oh.  And very few people have the talent, if they don't think well, to overcome that. 
[01:01:00]  All right, of course, here has a short lead.  He's running.  Thanks, old catcher's mitt lip.  Wow.  Travis has his Wikipedia page open, and it states clearly that he spells balls.  Oh, wonderful.  It states clearly.  Clearly.  You mean we should have maybe done a little research before you entered this bit?  It even says that Kiner's known to slurred speech.  Oh, God damn.  No, you know what, though? 
[01:01:30]  We're making accusations of Alzheimer's and drunkenness.  And the guy's got an affliction.  I'm sitting there.  You know what, though?  You know what?  Screw Ralph Kiner.  I'm a Mets fan.  He didn't sound this bad last year.  You know that, Danny.  Well, it's just funny because I'm just sitting on my couch and I'm like, man, this is going  to be great for tomorrow's show, man.  Also, there's a thing he might have.  I thought I looked to see if he's got a stroke or something.  Supposedly he had a stroke, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Danny was so excited that he IMs me. 
[01:02:00]  He's like, dude, you've got to turn on the Mets game.  Listen to Ralph Kiner.  Oh, no.  You know what, though?  If you're going to put, and this is coming from a Mets fan, if you're going to put Ralph  Kiner on the air slurring like that, you've got to acknowledge it and you've got to make  fun of it.  I'm sorry.  That's how it works.  And you know what they kept doing?  I mean, I guess they probably do it for all the guests that they have in the booth, but  they had to keep flashing on the screen a little bar that said, you know, voice of  Ralph Kiner.  Well, no one else wanted good credit for that voice.  Yeah.  Because you can't even, it doesn't sound anything like it used to sound. 
[01:02:30]  So, like, I felt like they kind of had to remind the people watching, like, who's there?  Because you're not going to know just by listening to that.  Oh.  One thing I've always contended, that the intestinal walk is a sad that gives the better  no frame.  Intestinal walk?  Yeah, what's up?  That was the intestinal walk.  What happened?  I've done that.  Yeah.  You ever do the intestinal walk?  You've got to hold your cheeks together.  Make it to the turlet.  I was thinking the intestine decided to walk out of Ralph Kiner's body because he's had 
[01:03:00]  it with the alcoholism.  Pink socking?  Yeah, well, that pink sock.  I see what you're doing to the liver in here.  I'm not, I don't want any part of your body anymore.  Get out of here.  Ed Cranepool got drunk together and Ed gave me the old pink sock.  Well, after that, he gave me a pink sock.  And Daryl Strawberry pushed my face into a pillow.  Yeah, did I ever tell you the time I got pink socked by Rusty Saab?  Well, let me tell you for real.  Why don't I tell you?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  One thing I've always contended, that the intestinal walk is a sad that gives the better no credit.  And if you don't get a chance to hit, it shouldn't be charged against you, which it isn't in  regular scoring.  Well, obviously we missed the play.  Thank you, Ralph.  Ralph, you're talking about your intestine walking out on you, and there's a freaking  play going on.  You think that's bad?  They probably didn't call the other guys.  I forget who's commentating for them now, but they probably didn't say anything about 
[01:04:00]  baseball for a solid half inning.  They were too busy talking about old Three Stooges reruns.  That's what they used to do.  Wait, you know what?  God bless them.  There's nothing to talk about.  Baseball is that boring for the most part.  Tell stories.  You get so used to...  Between home runs.  That's all I want.  You get so used to, like, listening to the commentary to know what's going on, because  all of a sudden they're talking about Three Stooges, and I'm like, what just happened?  Like, why was there a guy on base?  When did that happen?  But you're watching.  You can figure that out yourself. 
[01:04:30]  Dude, that is old school announcing.  They used to do that all the time, and then it got to the point where the announcers just  go through stats after stats, and a lot more advertising, so they go to commercial a lot more.  But these guys used to just talk about the most inane crap.  Exactly.  Three Stooges episodes.  Like, it was so interesting to them that, like, they went to commercial, and they came  back, and it was, like, midway through that part of the inning, and the guy's like, you  know, I just got to...  I want to finish up our Three Stooges conversation from before.  And, like, they brought it back. 
[01:05:00]  That was, like, one of the funniest things to watch, because they'd have to get the play  in, so you'd hear him going, yeah, oh, there it is.  I remember watching Moe Howard, who would do the finger thing into Larry's eyes, and,  you know, he'd actually bend his fingers so he didn't get him in there to pitch high  and wide for ball two.  Yeah.  It's like, what?  Wait a minute.  What is...  They were smooth, though, man.  Oh, yeah.  He'd just go right back into it.  Talking about where they ate.  The scooter.  The scooter.  Talking about his wife, Cora. 
[01:05:30]  The worst stories.  Who cares about Cora?  And Cora, and I...  No one cares, Phil.  Yeah.  Is there a train in this story with you and Bill White and Frank Messer?  This is not that I'm aired.  The scooter.  One more clip.  We could do kind of clips all day.  Yeah, sure.  We'll give you one more before.  One more of the saggy lip.  We'll move on.  I'm talking about Santana not pitching today.  He was scheduled to pitch.  And they took him out.  They didn't want Alana to know what he threw.  He's new to the National League. 
[01:06:00]  Sort of reminded me of the old evil fool joke that they pulled in Springton for the Mets  way back when, when they said they had Sid Fentz as a farcewick rookie that came to the ballpark.  He threw the ball 160 miles an hour.  No one saw him pitch.  Except the catcher.  That was Jerry Grody.  And maybe a couple others there.  And that was one of the great hoaxes that ever pulled off on baseball. 
[01:06:30]  Wasn't there a sport?  No, the greatest hoax is you.  Still broadcasting Met Games on TV.  Because I have no idea what he just said.  That's great.  I have no idea.  Someone here is saying, this sounds like Brooks from Shawshank.  He should end his career that way.  Got me a job at the food way.  The food way.  That ball high and wide.  And that was one of the great hoaxes that ever pulled off on baseball. 
[01:07:00]  Wasn't there a Sports Illustrated story about that too?  There was a S.I. story by a very famous writer.  I can't remember his name at the moment, but it sort of goes with being old.  You can't remember your own name at this moment.  It sort of goes with being old.  Yeah.  I saw a triple play once when I was a boy.  Because of being old, like having a limp **** too, that happens. 
[01:07:30]  And **** your pants.  Someone wants to know, well, it's Kevin from Connecticut.  He writes, who's calling this game, Ralph Kiner or Foster Brooks?  A Foster Brooks reference.  Wow.  Wow.  Going way back.  It's a Dean Martin Roaster joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got Kiner's grandson on the phone, Matt in New York.  How are you, Matt?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm sorry that we're making fun of the great Ralph Kiner, but we couldn't help ourselves, sir. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, man.  It's funny, but, yeah, it's painful for me personally.  I mean, it's sad, you know, degeneration.  I mean, I thought I'd just give you a little bit of his backstory.  I mean, he actually had a massive stroke about 10 years ago in 1998, and the organization didn't really publicize it very widely.  They tried to hush it up a little bit.  They just said, oh, he's kind of, he's got, you know, pneumonia or he's sick, so he was off the air for probably a year or more, and he couldn't talk at all. 
[01:08:30]  So when he got back on the air a couple years later, it was like a big deal, but, you know, you always notice he talked differently.  He wasn't, he was never quite the same, and some people said, oh, yeah, he's kind of tipsy or whatever, but it was really the stroke.  Well, you know, in 2004, my grandmother died of a very rare bone cancer, and he took that really, really hard.  Could you call every morning?  Sorry, this is very depressing.  I feel like idiots. 
[01:09:00]  Go ahead.  And he took that, yeah, he took that really hard, and he really did hit the bottle quite heavily, and they kept him around.  You know, the Mets organization, I think they can't really cut him loose totally because, you know, he's just part of the franchise.  He's been there since the first season or whatever in 61.  Is this guy for real?  I think he's for real.  Are you for real, Matt?  I'm absolutely not joking.  I mean, I've been to his house a number of times.  Well, they sold him now in Palm Springs.  He lives in Florida now.  He got remarried. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, you're one of those grandsons that, you know, you don't really get to really hang.  All right.  I got cousins like that.  I understand, sir.  Yeah.  I mean, we're related, but, you know, do we hang?  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, the can is one ball and two strokes.  Oh, no.  So, do you, do you, do you, do you get upset by all of the accusations that he's been drinking when he hasn't been? 
[01:10:00]  This guy doesn't get upset.  He hasn't been in the same house with Ralph Conner since he was born.  No, no, I, no, opiate, that's wrong.  Actually, I have, but, no, he, he actually does.  I believe he, I believe he really does drink pretty heavily now.  And so, I think it's half of his stroke and half his, yeah, he really is probably quite inebriated in a lot of the games.  But he's only around for a couple of innings now because they just don't want to let him go.  Well, there's a lot of young broadcasters out there that are pretty frustrated because they're like, look, come on. 
[01:10:30]  What are you doing?  I'm ready to be called up to the big leagues.  It was more than a couple, too.  Yesterday, he was on from probably the fourth inning to the beginning of the ninth.  So, he was in there for half the game.  He was feeling good.  No, I believe he should go.  I believe, honestly, he should be like, oh, I don't think he should be broadcasting anymore because, yeah, it's just, it's too much at this point.  But he's just like, Matt, you do know you're a horrible grandson, right?  Yeah, well, I mean, look, I got things going on in my family I wouldn't admit. 
[01:11:00]  This is your grandfather.  Yes, I know.  He's kind of sticking up for him, I guess.  You can learn a thing or two from the mob.  Shut your mouth.  I can laugh at Anthony and catch her, you know, mitt and lips or whatever.  I can laugh at that.  It's just sad, man.  Out of all of them, you had to remember that one.  You know, Jimmy said some hurtful things.  I did not.  Yes, you did.  What did I say?  I don't know. 
[01:11:30]  See?  They were hurtful.  It sounded more mean when Anthony said it.  All right.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So, when's the last time you saw him?  The last time I saw him was when he got remarried a couple, probably about, you know, almost two years ago.  And following that question, when was the last time he saw you?  Cared.  How old is his new wife?  Or remembers seeing you.  Good question.  She's actually, she's older than him, actually.  She's like, she's like late 80s, early 90s. 
[01:12:00]  Are you kidding?  Hold on.  Go back, E-Rock.  Are they banging, Matt?  How old is Ralph Kiner, your grandfather?  I believe he's 88.  Or 85.  I wouldn't be able to tell you how old my grandmother is.  No?  You have a grandmother?  Yeah, she's in a home.  I've never been there.  All right, Matt.  His wife was Diane Kiner, and she died in 2004 of cancer.  And that's the only reason why I think he drinks more heavily now. 
[01:12:30]  What kind of cancer?  That's why I think he drinks more heavily now.  What kind of cancer?  Bone cancer.  Oh, baby.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what?  You know what?  And if Jimmy ever ran into him on the street, he'd look right past Jimmy, too.  Why?  Because Jimmy, nobody notices him.  Celebrities just don't notice Jimmy. 
[01:13:00]  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks, Matt.  We've got to move on now.  Enough tragedy for one day.  We've got Ben Mesrick standing by.  His movie's coming out, which is very, very exciting.  Also, we've got Rampage Jackson also here already.  Oh, it's getting busy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Yeah, this is Rich Voss.  April 4th and 5th, I'll be at the Comedy Castle somewhere in Detroit or around that area.  Comedy Castle.  Look it up.  Rich Voss, April 4th and 5th.  Comedy Castle. 
[01:13:30]  Detroit area.  Great club, I hear.  I'm not talking about moving in.  And I don't want to change your life.  But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around.  And I'd really love to see you tonight.  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJ.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton. 
[01:14:00]  Ben's in the studio.  Ben Mesrick.  Yes.  We love Ben when he comes in here.  Is it Mesrich?  Mesrich.  Mesrich's good.  Is it Mesrich?  Yeah.  You can say either one.  Ben Mesrick, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like Mesrich, though.  It does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are rich, though.  Well, you know.  The movie's not out yet.  The movie's not out yet.  Hopefully later.  How annoyed were you that stupid Steve Martin's movie took the name of your book?  Bring it down the house.  That awful movie.  But, you know, when my book came out and that movie was out at the same time, people would 
[01:14:30]  call me and say, I saw a billboard for your book.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of worked well with.  Who does Queen Latifah play in your book?  A man, probably.  Let me do the basics for you, Ben.  Yeah.  You had a book out called Bringing Down the House.  I loved this book.  Way before I got to know you.  You know, Ben's been on our show a bunch of times, but I actually read that on vacation  and it was a page turner about these MIT students that took a lot of money from all  these casinos all over the place.  And then the movie's coming out this Friday, but you had to change the name to 21. 
[01:15:00]  There's a lot of readers out there that that's going to be a little confusing for people.  Well, we put out a new version of the book called 21.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  With new materials in the back.  It's got an interview with me and the main guy, a picture of me and the main guy.  So, you know, he's coming forward now, the actual MIT kid.  Right.  So, you know, there's some new stuff, but we put it out under the new title.  I think it's pretty cool.  It's a, you know, nice, short, easy name.  People know what it's about.  Yeah.  It's good.  Big Hollywood production, though.  That's kind of cool, huh?  It is.  Starring Kevin Spacey?  Kevin Spacey.  Oh.  Dana, who's here, produced the movie with the head of Kevin's company. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Dana's trying to figure out the scene here.  We're the producer.  He's the producer.  Yeah.  So, Kevin Spacey plays who?  The professor, Mickey, who recruits and trains the team of MIT kids.  And Lawrence Fishburne plays the private eye who's chasing them.  And Kate Bosworth plays the hot MIT girl.  Was there a hot MIT girl?  Well, in reality, this is the best looking group of MIT kids you've ever seen. 
[01:16:00]  But, you know, they're not.  Yeah.  You know, they got a cast for Hollywood.  Well, I mean, it's a movie, right?  Yeah.  If it was a movie of real MIT kids hitting, it would have been a very different movie.  And, of course, the story goes that the MIT kids got together and started this whole scheme of card counting.  They were doing it on the QT.  Right.  It was all they'd have these double lives.  And they'd change their look.  They'd have a makeup artist doing their makeup.  And they'd hit Vegas every Friday, fly from Boston to Vegas. 
[01:16:30]  And they won about five million bucks playing blackjack.  And they had that whole.  It was like James Bond.  They'd carry the money under their clothes and go through the airport with, like, $300,000 each under their clothes.  Wow.  Yeah, that sounds...  I remember being in a couple of airports in the bathrooms, getting money from people.  Okay, I'll take that back.  Better not be a dime missing.  You've already gone through this. 
[01:17:00]  Maybe a couple of times.  It's a lot of fun.  Safe to say Ant's done very well.  He's been advised not to really talk about it anymore.  Yeah, you know how it goes.  But he's done it for himself.  How long have you been involved with Kevin Spacey's company?  A while.  I started as an assistant 12 years ago.  Oh, so were you there when he did Swimming with Sharks?  It's my favorite movie.  No, just before that.  That's, yeah.  You ever see that with Frank Whaley?  That's twisted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a scummy movie executive.  But I think the best thing...  A complete ass. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Great representation of how awful Hollywood is.  Yeah.  All right.  So how's Larry Fishburne?  I won't call him Lawrence because he's been Larry since Apocalypse Now.  As far as I'm concerned, he's still Larry.  You know what?  He's great.  Cowboy Curtis, I like calling him from Pee Wee's Playhouse.  Yeah.  You want to go way back.  He's an intense guy.  He's really intense and scary and intimidating.  And I actually, at the end of the Vegas premiere, we end up going out until like five in the  morning and he's just very cool.  Yeah.  Like people come up to him and take his picture and he's like, not tonight, baby, not tonight.  And he's, you know, he's an orange fishburne, you know? 
[01:18:00]  No, he's just very like...  Jimmy's all mad.  He's love about it.  Yeah.  He's just very kind of like an iconic, I think.  Yeah.  Morpheus.  He just walks around like Morpheus.  Yeah.  He's Morpheus.  He is Morpheus.  He puts his hands behind his back like that.  It was a cool little walk.  Yeah.  Did you mention Cornbread Earl and me?  What?  What?  What?  Wasn't that his first movie?  It wasn't?  I don't know.  Apocalypse Now, I thought it was his first movie.  Apocalypse Now.  No, no, no.  I believe Cornbread Earl.  Wow, really?  Because he was a kid in Apocalypse.  Yeah, he was 17, I think, when he did that. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  And Ben, is it true you walked through an airport with, what, a couple hundred thousand?  Yeah, I wanted to become a part of the team to write the book, so I literally would, you  know, stuff money under my clothes and then something like $100,000 to $200,000 I carried  through Logan Airport, which is a scary thing because it's not illegal to carry your own  money, but if you get caught, you do end up handcuffed in a cell underneath  the airport.  Yeah, apparently you could carry anything through Logan, though.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, Logan is, yeah.  Come on, help us out, Logan.  No, but, you know, I became a part of the team and I'm not great at math, so my sort 
[01:19:00]  of thing was carrying money and then they would signal me what to do.  I was like a big, dumb gorilla at the table, a gorilla player.  Yeah, they'll ask you, like, hey, where'd you get the money if they find it?  Oh, if they find over $100,000 on you, they'll do more than that.  Yeah.  They're going to wonder where that came from.  Yeah.  They're a little curious.  Because you're either laundering it, it's drug money, there's some kind of problem.  Interestingly enough, if you fill a bag with Bellagio chips, they don't ask.  Really?  It's an interesting and nerve-wracking thing to think, but you can actually move a fair 
[01:19:30]  amount of money around with chips.  With chips?  Yeah, because they just think you're going to a poker game.  Like, they don't even think about it.  Interesting.  I didn't know that.  I don't know if I want to tell a lot of people that, but the MIT team did figure that out,  that you could carry a lot of chips on you.  But wait.  You just get one of those chip cases like you're going to a poker game.  Yeah, true.  You could have a million bucks in there.  Well, where do you trade?  You have to trade them and get them back to their later.  Yeah, but you go there, you get a bunch of people to trade.  You could do it.  Yeah, that's what they would do.  They'd go and then they'd have a bunch of different people trading in the chips,  because you can't trade in more than a certain amount without filling out forms. 
[01:20:00]  Is it over $10,000 or more?  It's over $10,000, but it depends on the situation.  But if you trade in more than 10,000 chips at a time, there's going to be forms filled out.  Okay.  Yeah.  Gotta watch that.  Raul has not forgotten, and Ben actually helped us out on the radio show.  Ant, I still think you're dope.  Remember the last argument we had about the effect other blackjack players have on you?  That's right.  I believe Ben was the one that proved you wrong.  Well, it wasn't so much a prove wrong as just a, he disagreed. 
[01:20:30]  I disagreed.  Was there a prove?  What was the argument again, really fast?  The argument is, if you're at a blackjack table, and there's somebody that really doesn't  play blackjack by what is deemed the rules, you know, you hit on 16 under, yeah, you stick  on 17 and over, depending on what the dealer has, you do certain things, and you adhere  to those rules, and the table's happy, and the odds are in your favor a little more than 
[01:21:00]  if you're goofing around, I believe.  And if somebody is at the table taking cards, it does screw the table up.  Totally.  And wait, Ben, you said you disagree with that?  Mathematically, it doesn't change.  Don't ever play with this guy, by the way.  He surrenders.  He's the worst player.  Oh, the surrendering player.  As soon as you walk over to my table, I get up and leave.  Ah, mush.  What's surrendering?  Surrender is actually a good move.  Is it?  At certain tables, they let it.  It's not a good move.  Don't ever.  You can surrender your two cards and get half your bet back. 
[01:21:30]  So if you have, like, a 16 against a dealer's 10, you surrender that hand and get half your  bet back.  And then the dealer pulls it.  But not all casinos offer it, but it's actually a good, no, surrender is a good move for the  player, but a lot of people are too, like, macho and do a U-turn, and you save your entire  bet.  You're there to gamble.  Right, that's Dana's point.  But the truth is, if you're man enough to understand that surrendering is an okay move, you can actually.  Man enough.  He thinks it's, you know, being.  Man enough to keep your bet that you put out initially. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  Ride it out.  Ride it out, no matter what the odds are.  You just don't know.  They flip over that card.  But, you know what, I agree with you that there are, you know, times in blackjack where  you go on these runs, and it is very, like, you know, highs and lows, and everyone's getting  good cards, and someone keeps hitting, keeps hitting, keeps hitting.  Mathematically, it doesn't really change anything.  But I can see, in terms of, like, the way the cards are going, how it feels like it's changing  things.  It definitely does, particularly when there's a run.  If somebody's not playing by basic strategy, I'll get up from the table. 
[01:22:30]  You've got to leave.  If I'm sitting there, and that dealer is showing a four, and someone hits on a 16, and draws  that picture card, and now the dealer flips over there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you don't know what the count is, so maybe he's going to draw a low card, you  know?  Unless you're counting.  Mathematically.  If you're counting.  Maybe.  Mathematically, it doesn't make a difference.  If you know the count, then it could make a difference, because you could be expecting  more face cards.  If you've been card counting, that's different.  But then there's the occasional chance they pull the small card, and then another, and 
[01:23:00]  they make it.  Yeah, then they're the hero.  Yeah, the hero.  I told you.  But I still, I don't even like when, I don't even like winning like that.  It's not a thing where it's like, because...  You don't like winning that way.  You know why?  Because it's too goddamn nerve-wracking.  Because it's too nerve-wracking, especially when you've got a big bet up there.  I don't want this guy determining my effing fate.  I want my cards and the dealer's cards.  I don't need this idiot next to me, smoking cigarettes.  But you don't like winning that way, so when you do win that way, do you give some of the 
[01:23:30]  money back?  Yeah, I do.  I just give it all back.  I didn't like winning like that.  It's like a push almost.  Yeah.  It's infuriating.  The movie sounds like it's going to be a biggie.  How are the reviews so far?  Early reviews are good.  We've got a great Rolling Stones review.  We've got a great variety review.  I think the movie looks great.  I really do.  I think people are going to love it.  People like the book.  I honestly don't think you can mess this one up.  The book was amazing.  I think the movie is going to be just as good.  I hope people really do. 
[01:24:00]  I really do.  Man, it was better than the book.  When I first saw it, I was blown away by it.  Really?  Because you know what?  It captured something about hitting Vegas that first time.  You know, when you land and you look down outside the plane window and you see Vegas.  I mean, there's nothing like it.  And there's also been a lot of movies that have shown Boston being kind of dark and like  The Departed.  And this is like the young college fun Boston.  So it's in a lot of ways, it really captured a lot of the book.  You know, you just nailed that.  There's a lot of movies that have come out recently about Boston.  Right.  And they make it look like just a gritty dark city. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  And?  Huh?  And?  It's not.  Oh, does this show corruption and date rape and all the other fun stuff that goes on  in Boston?  It's like there's no, no, no, no.  Gone Baby Gone was very, very dark.  The Departed was very dark.  Yeah.  It's good they show the other side.  Mystic River.  Mystic River was dark.  Yeah.  It was kind of cool.  And now you see, you know.  People, white people accuse of crimes are dark.  Right.  Right.  But then you see 21 and it's like college kids who look like Kate Bosworth, you know, which  is very realistic.  Right.  And hitting Vegas every weekend. 
[01:25:00]  It's just, it's just cool.  And also like.  Clearly put the Hollywood angle on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  How do the, how do the other participants feel about who's playing them and get a laugh  out of it?  Listen, the main kid, Jeff, he loves, you know, Jim Sturgis is fantastic.  And Jim's like this guy that girls just go crazy.  Like we were in Austin for the film festival and he had to go out a back door and there's  like girls waiting, you know.  The 15 year old girl's just waiting for him outside because he was in that Beatles movie 
[01:25:30]  across the universe and he's just got this, you know, he's, he's really good in the movie  and the other kids are really good.  It's, it's a great cast of young kind of fun actors.  And how, how do the real participants though?  You know what?  A couple of them were at the premiere unbeknownst to me, a bunch of the MIT kids were there  and I ran to them afterwards that they were like, you know, it was, it was really  good.  I mean, there's some things in it that if you're a professional card counter, you're going  to be like, okay, you know, but I mean, Hollywood version, right.  But in general, the MIT kids really liked it. 
[01:26:00]  The ones that I talked to seemed to love it.  Did anyone ever catch you guys doing it?  Like a, did any savvy pit boss or dealer ever go, wait a minute?  No, no, no.  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, we, you know, when I joined, like I went to the team to write it, we were getting  kicked out everywhere because I was sort of towards the end of their thing and you'd  have people come in and throwing you out all the time and stuff, you know, worse sometimes.  They got chased out of Shreveport, Louisiana by like a, you know, a sheriff with a shotgun.  I mean, literally like that, like to that degree.  That is the end of a run when you're in Shreveport, Louisiana. 
[01:26:30]  And there's like a couple of sheriffs following you.  Kicked us out of everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was once when we were filming in Vegas when Mike DeLuca, the other producer on the  movie, and we actually learned to count.  What we realized is it's extremely difficult.  And one time me and Mike were sitting there and he was counting and the pit boss came over  and it was like, hey, Mike, if you're going to count, don't move your lips.  But also during, we were in Vegas and the main guy, Jeff, the real guy, we were at the  Playboy Club and he was 20 feet away from a blackjack table. 
[01:27:00]  And a pit boss came over and said, Jeff, you got to step back a little bit.  Wow.  He wasn't allowed to be within 20 feet of a table.  So they're pretty serious about it there.  I mean, they don't want you anywhere near.  If he walks into any casino, will they know who he is?  Yeah, pretty much.  If he comes near a blackjack table, the cameras will get him.  And, you know, he can walk around a casino and the casinos love the movie.  I mean, we shot it in a lot of the casinos because it makes people think you can be blackjack.  But they don't let him anywhere near a blackjack table.  I mean, they really don't.  Even like for the fun of the movie and everything's great, but he can't play blackjack. 
[01:27:30]  Really?  Yeah.  That night we went into the Playboy Casino.  I went up and my host was like, hey, how are you?  And then we cashed in our chips and we're sitting down and he goes, your boy can't play.  I'm like, what do you mean my boy can't play?  It's like, your boy can't play.  And I look over and he's got like four security around.  Holy man.  It's amazing how like Vegas and all these plays, they are built on raping you out of your money.  And the one guy that can beat him and these pricks are like, no, you can't.  What are they calling them?  And it's crazy because the most they're going to lose.  I mean, they're making millions a day and he's going to win a few hundred thousand dollars. 
[01:28:00]  How do they get away with that?  Telling you you can't play.  It's their rules.  The innkeeper law or something.  Yeah.  It's their business.  It's like their hotel.  They can throw anybody out they want.  And it's different in Atlantic City.  They can't just throw you out in AC, but they make the rules really harder there for a card kind.  They shuffle up a lot and then they do stuff like that.  That's amazing.  Just because you can count some of the cards, they can beat you.  That just sucks.  Maybe, man, if you were actually doing it and like writing down, like if you had a thing with...  Yeah, well, that would be...  NQ. 
[01:28:30]  Check.  Check.  Check.  All right.  Just sitting there, Adam.  Excuse me, sir.  We have to take a break and we've got a very busy show.  So if you guys want to stick around, you're more than welcome.  But we've got pretty much a trained killer coming in here.  So you're going to at least...  You're going to have to give up your seat at the very least.  I say that what they do is they stay in that seat right there and they wait for Rampage to walk in.  And they look at him like, go ahead.  What are you going to do?  You guys know who Rampage Jackson is?  I know, yeah. 
[01:29:00]  He's coming in next.  He's intense.  And actually, he's intense.  Ben was talking trash about him.  No, I was not.  Oh, yeah.  Were you, Ben?  You were saying some awful things.  I'm like 12 pounds.  No, no.  I run away.  He's the light heavyweight champion of the UFC.  He's a tremendous fighter.  He's a problem.  Yeah.  But he's also a very funny guy.  Very funny guy.  So, it's Ben Mesrick and, of course, Dana, the producer of 21 in theaters Friday.  Anything else you guys want to say about it?  I'm excited.  I'll be there on Friday.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Now, I think people are going to love it.  Actually, I'll be there on Monday or Tuesday. 
[01:29:30]  I don't like being in crowded theaters these days.  It will be crowded, hopefully.  I think it will be.  All right.  And benmesrick.com to see what you're about, Ben.  Yeah.  Ben is always interesting.  I mean, last time you were in, we were talking about the sex shops of Japan.  Right.  And the oil guys.  Dana and I have that movie going out next week, actually, about the sex shops in Japan.  Well, it's not about the sex shops.  Well, no.  It's about, it's like Wall Street in Japan kind of thing.  Wait, you're starting another movie?  Well, yeah.  We have two projects going out next week to a bunch of studios, but one of them is-  And then two other projects currently set up. 
[01:30:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  We got a couple of movies together.  Look at that.  So hopefully you'll be back here.  If you need any actors, believe me, I do great work.  Yes.  Thanks to the man.  Yeah.  You want a guy getting booted out of a sex shop?  I don't even want money.  I'll be happy to play a guy getting booted out for asking for something disgusting that  they don't do.  How funny would that be?  A documentary.  We'll do that as a documentary.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  We got to get right back into this. 
[01:30:30]  In studio, Rampage Jackson.  We love this guy, man.  How are you, Rampage?  I'm doing good.  Kind of early in the morning.  How y'all doing?  He goes, last time I was here, you guys had a crackhead on.  Like a crackhead.  We're trying to figure it out.  We're asking questions.  I thought maybe it was one of the homeless guys we had in or something.  Right.  And we're asking more and more questions.  It turns out it was Rich Voss.  He goes, you had a crackhead in here last time I was here.  Yeah, crackhead.  And then we understood why, because that was the day Rich Voss admitted that he used to wear tiny  little Daisy Dukes to turn on his drug dealer to get a little more crack. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, he found out the drug dealer liked guys, so Rich played up to it to get a better deal.  That's when you hit rock bottom.  That is a true crackhead.  That's a true crackhead.  That's why calling him a crackhead is completely accurate.  That's worse than a crackhead.  And if he's admitting to that, you know he did things that were just a little more awful than just wearing that.  I remember that day, too, because when guys like you come in, we want to look kind of like men and look a little tougher. 
[01:31:30]  And we got Rich Voss telling the story of the Daisy Dukes, you know, doing stuff to drug dealers possibly to get a crack.  Like, this guy's never coming back on this fairy show.  I was over there.  And we're such a dumb radio show, because Voss had an altercation yesterday where he tried throwing karate kicks.  And why did we not have him in today to at least get an assessment from a true fighter on if he knows anything or not.  We did a pilot for Comedy Central yesterday, and Rich Voss, the crackhead, ended up throwing karate kicks to Keith Robinson, who then ended up beating the crap out of him. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, Keith's one of our comic friends.  You know one of those guys that, like, when they get pulled over and they go, do you know how fast you were going?  He'll go, what?  To the cops, like that type of guy.  Oh, he that type?  One of those guys, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's a problem.  He's a problem.  Oh, he's a problem.  Oh, dude, does he get out of the tickets, though, when they say that?  Yes, because they charge him with resisting arrest.  Yeah, they forget about the ticket real quick. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, there's a great story about Keith.  He's told this one where the cops, he's just like, he's a crazy dude.  And he's just, well, you know, those Philadelphia dudes, like, they always have all that study-listed mentality.  And they pulled him over, and he's fighting the cops.  And he's in the middle of this, like, why am I doing this?  And they pulled Mace out, and he goes, I eat Mace for breakfast.  So they tested him, and it didn't go down as well as he did.  Maybe he needs bacon and eggs with it.  He really said that to Kyle?  I eat Mace for breakfast.  Who would say that?  Who would say that? 
[01:33:00]  Somebody about to get Mace for breakfast.  Yeah, he is a problem.  But Keith is just one of those guys, he has a button that's just, it would probably make  him bad in your profession, because he's probably too angry to think in a moment like that.  Yeah, he'll probably gas out, because, you know, your mind gets to going, you get so mad,  angry, you want to go, you want to not like this guy, that your body's like, man, please,  slow.  Yeah.  He was jumping around in this ring yesterday before the actual event with Rich.  He was doing a sunny list, man. 
[01:33:30]  He was bopping.  He was so psyched, because he had the gear on, he had the gloves and everything, and he  was so psyched to just punch somebody, and, you know, he went after Rich, and just punched  him in the head, many times, very hard, and got Rich really aggravated, to the point where  Rich kicked him.  Who, the crackhead?  Yeah, yeah.  The crackhead started karate in his ass, trying to karate kick.  But he's not a good...  Why you gotta be up on a crackhead like this?  Well, Voss kicking, him kicking is like an old woman swinging her purse, yelling, 
[01:34:00]  masher, he's not...  We saw him throw a kick, it's the funniest thing I've ever seen, about 10 years ago,  it was a girl I was dating, we were standing in front of this Chinese place, and Voss was  like, I used to take karate, we're like, let's see a kick, he threw a straight, stiff  leg kick, and he slipped in garbage juice, and he fell ass and back in the garbage juice  in the side, I have never been happier than to watch that idiot.  Oh, is that great?  You know the stuff that leaks out of the garbage bags?  It's wonderful liquid if you're doing karate. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, that's a new nickname for one of my friends.  Garbage juice.  Thanks, bro, thanks, dog.  Garbage juice and a crackhead, they go together, huh?  Oh, how hard were you laughing?  I've never been happier about anything, because he went down, when you throw a straight kick,  and you slip...  You're going right on your tailbone.  He was in his late 40s, it was nothing, I've never been happier to see anything happen.  Yeah, good.  Oh, okay, okay, I thought you said a crackhead did that.  Oh, no, Voss!  Voss, it was Rich Voss!  Rich Voss, same guy.  The ex-crackhead.  The crackhead. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, now we're calling him the crackhead.  The crackhead that slipped in garbage juice.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Oh, okay, yeah.  He's going to act like he knew how to handle himself.  Rampage, you got a great laugh.  Do you use that laugh when you're beating the crap out of someone?  I would like to imagine that you're just destroying someone and laughing the entire time.  No, I don't normally laugh after the fight if I won and some of them in the locker room.  Like, you know, I'm happy then.  But, damn, I'm fighting, man.  I'm serious, dog.  Yeah.  I make jokes and stuff like that.  But as soon as that octagon close and I remember he said, let's go, I'm serious until I whoop 
[01:35:30]  his ass.  It's hard to imagine you're only a light heavyweight.  Yeah, because I look like a heavyweight right now.  I put on a few airbeats.  No, I can't imagine they're bigger than you is what I'm saying.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm average size for a light heavyweight.  Like, Forrest is actually bigger than me.  Tito, he looked bigger than me.  He got a big ass head and a big shoulder, but he had a little bit of tiny legs.  Oh, really?  Chuck is taller than me.  I'm average size.  I'm average light heavyweight size.  We used to do a bit and we had to stop it, but Tito came in here back in the day.  This goes back probably five or six years ago. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  And we wanted to see how long Steve, our big guy Steve, how long he could last against  Tito.  It took four seconds.  I think we had to call an ambulance and we had to stop the bit.  Because I would love to see a rampage to the same, this guy.  Steve, would you, 12 seconds you lasted?  12.  Tito?  No, you didn't.  But you've retired from that bit, right?  Yeah.  You don't want Rampage Jackson to try to beat that record.  I would love to see the tape of that because I think it was quicker than 12 seconds.  Maybe 11 seconds. 
[01:36:30]  You're buying me right now.  I'm out of shape.  I've just been hanging out and stuff like that.  Is that it?  You've just been hanging?  He doesn't want a lawsuit.  It's basically what he's saying.  How long does it take you to get back into fighting shape once you...  Fighting shape?  Yeah.  Like from the condition, because you say you're out of shape, which is hysterical.  But yeah, from today, listen.  I can get in fighting shape in eight weeks from today.  Really?  It'd be a lot of hard work.  I'd be sore.  Get a massage twice a week or something like that.  But in eight weeks, I could be in fighting shape.  If I had to be in fighting shape, I could do it in eight weeks. 
[01:37:00]  How many hours a day?  To put them together, I'd probably train like five and a half, if you add running.  I do 35 minutes on the elliptical, and I'm like, man, I can eat whatever I want now.  I can eat whatever I want now.  I was interested if we were talking about getting LASIK surgery and stuff like that,  and you wear lenses.  Does that affect you when you fight or not at all?  No, I take them out because I can see, you know what I'm saying, but I just can't see  people's faces from far away or street signs and stuff like that. 
[01:37:30]  So I just take my contacts out when I fight.  I can see good.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's good.  Just run to the other end of the ring and just stay there.  Yeah, I just can't.  Stay away from you.  Yeah, I can see.  I just can't see the crowd.  I don't want to see the crowd face anyway.  I have a ton of vision, you know.  I don't want to see the crowd anyway.  Most of them be ugly, man.  You look at the front row.  How do your ugl ass get a front row kick?  I'm sorry, Dana White.  It's Dana White, the president.  My bad, Dana.  How much does the crowd affect you when they're, if they're cheering? 
[01:38:00]  Have they ever been cheering for the other guy?  Yeah, I'm telling you that.  And does that affect you or are you focused?  Dude, during the fight, it don't bother me.  But after the fight, after I got knocked, chucked out, I got booed.  Wow.  I was devastated because I'm like the most fan-friendly guy ever.  And I noticed since that fight, I have not been so fan-friendly with the American fans  because I'm an international fighter.  I mostly fight in Japan.  It came out of pride and all that.  Yeah.  Then I got booed from doing my job, from knocking somebody out.  I thought it was a sighted knockout.  And I got booed. 
[01:38:30]  I was like, whoa.  So I didn't know what fans were really my fans.  And some people are fake.  They come and want your autograph just to have your autograph and stuff.  And so, yeah, they really bothered me after the fight getting booed.  But you know what it is, though, man?  Ty Cobb said, because he used to get booed on the road all the time.  That's a great compliment.  And I think Liddell was like the first big name in the sport.  And they're seeing like a great titan.  They're seeing like the next group come up, the next generation.  That's how they're looking at it.  Like, man, our guy just went down.  It is in a weird way of respecting.  It's certainly not indifference.  But you beat a guy that they didn't think was beatable. 
[01:39:00]  And it's interesting that he came back and beat Silva, which I was kind of nervous for him.  And Silva beat you twice.  It's a very weird parody in UFC.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Styles make a fight and stuff like that.  And I think that if I would have fought Ventile in the UFC, I would have beat him.  That's what I think.  Because Ventile, he was a Chuck Liddell of pride.  But the thing about pride in the UFC, which is different, the UFC lets it be real.  It happens what happens. 
[01:39:30]  But Ventile, if you get the best of him in the fight, they'll stop it so Ventile can recover.  If you beat up Ventile on the ground, which most people do because he's a good stand-up guy, they'll stand you up.  And that's what happened to me.  And other fighters that fought Ventile Silva.  So if I would have fought Ventile in the UFC, he probably might have never beat me.  Now, is pride, there was this thing like when pride, I think those fighters start to come over.  People are like, the pride guys are, is UFC a tougher?  Or are they pretty comparable as far as where's a tough place to fight?  Well, I think, to be honest, I think it's, like I said, I think it's tougher to fight in pride just because, like, 
[01:40:00]  and I don't know how much I can say, but it wasn't, like, the UFC is ran by regular people.  Pride wasn't.  Let me put that out there like that.  It was ran by other people.  The government stuff is different over there.  So, you know, pride, anything, anything happened, the referee wanted the other guy to win, he can kind of alter the fight.  Oh, wow.  A little bit of what people just don't know.  But UFC, they real.  I was surprised that after I knocked Chuck out that he didn't win by decision. 
[01:40:30]  You know what I'm saying?  No, y'all laughing.  But in Japan, stuff like that can happen.  That can happen in Japan.  That can happen in Japan.  Wow.  You know what I'm saying?  Stuff like that happens, you know, and it was like, whoa.  So, you know, yeah, but if you take a fighter from, none of the fights in the ring, you put him in a cage.  If you've never seen a cage before in his life, most likely he's going to, you know, people might react different.  He might feel like an animal, you know, he might, you know, get, you know, scared or something like that.  So, yeah, it's crazy.  You knocking Chuck out was, I mean, again, even though you'd already beaten him, it was surprising because, you know, we're not used to seeing Chuck just go down. 
[01:41:00]  But I think they said that that was rated the second best knockout of the year next to Gonzaga knocking out Mirko Krokop, which I was really surprised at.  That kind of, you haven't heard much about him.  I think he lost again after that, too, didn't he?  Yeah, he lost to my friend, one of my trading partners, Chek Kongo from France.  Yeah, and it was kind of crazy because we was training together for that fight, me, Chek, and my other friend, Michael Bisbing, and Chek Kongo got hurt and he started getting sick. 
[01:41:30]  I was like, oh, man, you're fighting Krokop, dawg. You might not take this fight because most of the time when Krokop gets knocked out, he comes back the next time and murders the guy.  Normally, yeah.  And, I mean, if he loses or something, if he loses or something, he comes back and murders the guy the next time.  But my boy, Chek Kongo, wasn't 100% and he, Chek Kongo whooped his butt.  I was like, whoa, man, I got much respect.  I started battling down, like, whoa, Chek.  I didn't see the fight.  Did he beat him standing up or did he get on the ground?  Yeah, he beat him standing up.  Wow.  If he went to the ground, he beat him on the ground.  But my boy, Chek Kongo, he's a Muay Thai fighter. 
[01:42:00]  He's like 6'3", or something like 6'4", and I'll rip all muscle, like 240, 250.  And he's, like, from Africa.  He's a French guy from Africa.  What kind of mix is that?  That's great, yeah.  That's a little crazy.  I get a black guy talking to me.  Fully, who's this?  He was, oh.  I'm like, what the hell?  What is that?  He's so big, I'll slap you.  You embarrass yourself.  You embarrass yourself.  You're African, at least.  Rampage is in here, what, promoting the ultimate fighter? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  This sounds like a really good concept.  Team Rampage versus Team Forrest.  Yeah.  What can you tell us about it?  Yeah, I can tell y'all that it's airs on Spike.  Tonight at 10 p.m., right?  April 2nd.  Oh, April 2nd?  April 2nd starts.  Okay.  That's what I can tell you.  I can tell y'all, for real, I've heard it was, like, one of the best shows.  I never really watched the shows before.  I heard it was one of the best seasons.  So, you and Forrest, you're both coaching different fighters?  Different teams.  Okay, different teams, and they're obviously competing.  What are they competing for?  Who compete for? 
[01:43:00]  The fighters?  The teams.  Yeah, just where it was, or?  The fighter is competing to get a, what, six-figure contract.  Oh, okay.  That's what I think.  With the UFC.  And then, at the end, you're going to fight?  I'm going to fight Forrest July 5th, I believe.  Wow.  Is that a championship fight?  Yeah, every time I fight, it's for the championship, baby.  I got the belt.  It's on the line every time I fight.  How does it feel being the guy?  Because now you're the guy.  Like, for a long time, it was Chuck, or it's this guy.  Now you're the guy that everybody is gunning for.  You know what?  I'm just not realizing that.  I'm hearing interviews, and people calling me out. 
[01:43:30]  People in other weight classes calling me out.  I got this heavyweight Kimbo Slice I heard.  It might be true, it might not be true, calling me out.  I'm like, hold on, dawg.  You're not even in my weight class.  I don't even think you can come make my weight class.  He don't even fight in my organization.  I got guys.  I'm like, damn.  Why don't you call out the heavyweight champion?  They all want a piece of it.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  I said, is it because I'm black?  He was like, no, because I'm black.  I'm like, damn.  That would be worse if he said yes. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, how do you feel about the wrestlers trying to make a name for themselves in the UFC?  You got Brock Lesnar.  What do you think of his debut?  You know what?  I was very impressed by Brock Lesnar.  I think it's good, you know, that pro wrestlers can come over.  I think that's a little bit of what our sport needs, like some of the guys are more character  like, but come and do some real stuff.  But Brock Lesnar, he came, he didn't bring any WWE with him, you know what I'm saying?  He didn't act a fool or anything like that.  I was kind of hoping he would come out and, you know, bring something.  I think we need just a little bit of that. 
[01:44:30]  A little more smack talk and stuff like that.  Just a little bit of that fight for real.  And, you know, back up your smack, but, you know what I'm saying, you notice people watch  what they say when they go on out, they get an ass kicked in real.  Brock didn't do any smack talk whatsoever.  He was really, really serious.  He didn't do no smack talk?  I don't think so.  He came out and he was just all business.  He did a good job.  He almost finished Mirror.  He's got to figure out that grounds thing a little bit, right?  I think, I'll tell you, he's going to be champion in the future.  Really?  Wow.  Here's why nobody smack talks, because they break your arms or legs. 
[01:45:00]  It's not like boxing where you're just going to get knocked out.  It's like you're relying on a guy.  Like, as you're tapping, he has to stop or he's going to snap your leg or break your arm.  So, if you talk a lot of crap, you may just go, uh, whatever.  They go, oh, I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, especially when you go with the guys from, like, Brazil, because one of the guys,  I don't want to say his name, the guy was talking smack at the weigh-ins or the interview  before, and it's part of the game, you know, but the Brazilian guy didn't like it,  and he choked him, and the guy tapped him every time I pulled him off, he was still  choked, like, no, he didn't want to kick him out. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, kick him out.  Yeah, don't play that.  Huh.  You get any, uh, you get into any street fights?  Chuck Liddell was telling us some great stories, man.  When you guys get together and have a few drinks, it gets a little ugly sometimes.  Yeah, you know, I don't, I haven't gotten to a street fight in a long time.  I think the last street fight I got into since I've been a professional fighter was probably  my cousin.  Really?  Yeah, man, I got a cousin like six months younger than me, and I actually grew up fighting  him my whole life.  My mom said I've been fighting her since I was in Pampers, and she remembered, I don't 
[01:46:00]  remember, but she told me, and me and him never got along, but we were like the best of friends  growing up, you know, because his mom and my mom, like, his mom is my mom's niece.  Right.  And we grew up together, they grew up, and I grew up with this guy, I can't stand, I  love him and my cousin, but I can't stand him, and we was kind of like, we was the bad  guys of the family while I was getting in trouble.  So, so once I got, you know, become a professional fighter, you know, so I come back home and  visit and stuff like that, and then he still remember me fighting him all the time.  He, he mess with me, and he said, ah, ha, ha, ha, you can't beat me up now, you're  a professional fighter and stuff like that. 
[01:46:30]  I said, no, man, I don't want to mess with you no more.  I've changed, you know.  I used to fight on the street a lot.  I said, now I don't have to prove myself.  He did something to me that pissed me off, and then as you know, the old flash, my old  memories came back.  I just whooped his ass real quick.  Oh, man.  I was like, oh, I felt bad.  That's gotta suck to me.  Yeah, but he knew how to press my buttons.  He like, he knows how I am.  He come and just pinch both my nipples.  I'm like, man, what the hell wrong with you?  He knows me for my whole life.  He knows I don't like stuff like that.  He just comes and pinch my nipples.  He just actually, I guess he wanted to see how a professional ass whooping felt. 
[01:47:00]  See, I'm just the opposite.  That would endear me to somebody.  Like, oh.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, you would get a teehee from Jimmy if you did that to him.  Yeah, I like that.  I need that.  I don't like that.  I don't even like girls pinching my nipples.  You don't like a girl to do it?  I don't like a pinch.  Come on, pinch them both my nipples.  I don't like that.  I'm not a fan either.  I hear you.  It's a little weird, Jimmy.  It's a little weird, man.  Come on.  Not pinching.  I like a brush.  Like a light palm brush.  That's different.  Oh, okay.  All right, good.  Thank you.  Yeah, pinching is kind of different.  You know what was called the purple nurple, where they would twist in school or something 
[01:47:30]  like that, that deserves a professional beating.  Oh, you know what?  They should let that be legal in the UFC.  Actually, it's not illegal, so you guys might see that in my next fight.  Hey, I'm going to look at the cameras.  It's going to be for you guys, right?  Hell, twist.  Guy taps out.  I hate that.  That is not in the rule book.  I'm going to have my manager look it up.  That is not in the rule book.  Forrest Griffin, watch out for the purple, what is it?  The purple nurple.  The purple nurple, homie.  How demeaning would that be?  You get your ass kicked and you get a purple nurple. 
[01:48:00]  When the guy's got that surprise look that you just did it, you just clock him in the  face.  Yeah.  He's done.  Did he just give me a purple nurple?  And are people asking you a lot about the Liddell rematch the third time?  Because you're the only guy he hasn't beaten.  I know.  So what's the problem?  So what's up with that?  Two, okay, I would understand if he would have beat me the second time, but now it would  be a rubber match.  You know what?  I don't care.  I think if I beat Chuck a third time, I'm like, okay, when's the we match?  Do you want to fight him?  I fight him.  It's my job to fight.  You know what I'm saying?  Chuck, I think Chuck draws a big pay-per-view.  And that's what I like. 
[01:48:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not going to sit here and say I fight for any other reason besides money.  What do you see as Chuck's weakness that you've been able to beat him twice?  What does he do that allows you to get in there?  He gets in the ring with me.  That's it.  That's his weakness.  Not to be cocky or anything, but I feel like I'm the best fighter in the world.  Every time I lost, I know why I lost.  Most people say this and make excuses and stuff like that, but I'm keeping it real.  I'll tell you a secret about me. 
[01:49:00]  I'm real.  I have no shame.  I have no ego.  I'm keeping it real.  You know what I'm saying?  I get my ass kicked.  I've lost five times.  I got to disqualify once.  But every time I've lost, you know what I'm saying, I know why I lost.  You know what I'm saying?  And if I go in a fight close to 100%, I'm pretty confident that I'm going to win.  I don't care how many people Chuck knocks out.  I don't care what he do, this, that.  But I'm confident that I'm going to win.  Very cool.  And they said that body mistake Chuck made was something that he just, there was some 
[01:49:30]  kind of a body punch he threw that he never should have thrown against you.  Yeah, because I have my own style of defense.  I think I have some of the best defenses in mixed martial arts because I believe if a guy  can't hit you or take you down or kick you or whatever, you know, then you got a good  chance of kicking his ass.  So Chuck knew that from our first fight.  And I'm pretty sure he watched the tapes on our fight.  And he saw my defense style.  And he probably thought that since I have a certain style of defense that I leave my  body open.  And Chuck actually has one of the best body shots in MMA. 
[01:50:00]  And he hit me with a body shot at our first fight.  I know he remember hitting me.  And it was at the end of the round, thank God.  Oh, you felt that one?  I felt that one because in my sport, if you take a knee from a body shot, the fight's over  because they can punch you.  In a boxer, you get a count.  So if you take, if you take, like, you can't take a knee from a body shot.  You can't go, like, we go down from a body shot.  Oh, you go down, punch you, yeah.  Why don't any of these shots break a rib or something?  Some, some do.  Like, if any of us got hit, like, you guys are getting hit in that ring, we would be  destroyed.  I think we're built a little differently. 
[01:50:30]  No, but what makes it different?  Because you're a human when it comes down to it.  Because we, because we, we got muscles, because we exercise and we, and we, our body,  your body gets a tolerance towards things.  We build it up and we get posture and stuff a lot.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  So the muscle around it is pretty solid and kind of takes a punch, but they still get  broken ribs.  Yeah, we still get, I see them guys get broken ribs.  But so, that's why Chuck threw the body shot, because he figured that was going to be his  out, you know, so he knew my defense pretty good.  So he tried, if you watch the fight dissecting, he tries to set me up for it.  I act like he's going to throw a hook, you know, and Chuck has the best setups. 
[01:51:00]  Chuck is a damn good fighter.  Yeah.  When you dissect and you break him down, and I knew I was in there with the best, so I had,  and I had to train for the best, and I prepared, I had the best trainers around me.  You guys have no idea I had the best trainer, and then for that camp, I had the best sparring  partners.  I flew sparring partners from all over the world.  We just want you two to get along, because we like both of you guys.  Hey, Chuck is cool.  We just want you guys to get along.  Me and Chuck is sitting right here and kicking like, when me and Chuck fought in a tournament  in Japan.  Yeah.  We both won our fights.  We knew we was fighting each other the next time we would see each other, but we was in 
[01:51:30]  a bar buying each other drinks.  That's cool.  I have so much respect for Chuck.  He's a good guy.  Where are you at with Silva?  You had some bad blood there?  Yeah, me and Silva don't even talk to each other.  Oh, you don't like you?  You genuinely don't like him?  Because I keep it real.  I guess he gets mad, because, excuse me, Silva is the type of guy that thinks everybody  should be afraid of him.  Every fighter, he wants everybody to be afraid of him.  And the way I react around him is different from other fighters who fight him.  I'm not afraid of Vanley Silva, because I've seen his fight tapes.  They call him ex-murder, because when he was coming out of his fights, he really ain't 
[01:52:00]  fighting a whole lot of people.  You know what I'm saying?  They just throwing him chumps, and he would just go out there and murder them, because  they're chumps, right?  So I'm like, you know what I'm saying?  This guy, a chump murderer.  I'm not scared of this guy.  So I hang around.  I speak my mind at press conference.  I say whatever I want to say.  He'd look at me all crazy, like I was about to back down.  I'm like, man, dude, I'm from the streets, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't get intimidated by guys like you.  And I go out there, and I fight him.  And I fight him straight up.  I fight Chuck.  Four to five minutes later, I fight Van Der Le.  You know what I'm saying?  And I'm kicking his ass, and they stand me up, because he's a champion. 
[01:52:30]  They want him to win a tournament.  And I vocalize that.  You can go back and watch the fight, and you can see his quarterman telling the referee  to stand him up.  And what American people don't know is that Van Der Le is smart.  His team is smart.  He had a Japanese manager in Japan, and Japanese in Brazil stick together.  There's more Japanese in Brazil than anywhere in the world besides Japan.  You know what I'm saying?  So they stick together.  And he had a Japanese manager.  And I think some of the referees take payoffs in Pride. 
[01:53:00]  I'm telling you.  That's why I like the UFC so much, because they ain't with that.  But in Pride in Japan, I promise you that they take payoffs.  You just didn't trust them.  Hey, we heard that you never saw two girls, one cop.  How did that come up?  The girl that brought me here said something about two girls.  I thought she said two girls, one cop.  I'm like, two girls, one cop?  And she said, yeah, they was crapping and throwing up.  I said, well, they called two girls, one cop.  Where the police come in at?  They should have got arrested, right?  You've never seen this?  I've never seen it. 
[01:53:30]  Just react to it.  I can't see it.  Because we got to just watch.  Wait, wait.  Let them get close.  Get close, man.  We got a mic for you over there and everything.  We show this to everybody.  We show this to all the big stars that come in.  We're very proud of us being able to show this.  I don't think Rampage will be thrown.  He's seen some stuff in his day, but let's see if we get a reaction out of Rampage.  You have to be able to have my seat.  Of course you can.  You can have the radio show if you want.  The chair and your seat.  Right.  Here's two girls, one cop.  Rampage Jackson.  Check it out.  Where are they? 
[01:54:00]  Just in a little setting.  In a doctor's office.  Yeah, you know.  Just getting an exam.  Starts out nice, right?  It's a little something.  Nice, and then you...  He's cringing.  A lot of crap.  He's cringing.  It's not going to throw them.  They're looking at it like ice cream.  Hold on.  Whose crap was that?  That's fake.  No, it's real.  No, no, no.  They crapped in a cup, then they changed it to something else. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, well.  They're probably dumping it out, but they're dumping it out like crazy.  That's not the ice cream.  That's what I think.  Well, that's not ice cream, though.  That wasn't ice cream.  All right, so this is not going to work.  No, I told you he's not going to be thrown.  No, he's not thrown.  I'm a fighter, dog.  Yeah.  Does this bother you?  Does that bother you?  These girls are sick.  Yeah.  They certainly are.  Who's going to date those two girls, but each other?  Yeah, no one's going to want to... 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that insane?  You're not going to want to, like, kiss them or...  You're never going to be insane when you watch this video.  I'm like, come on, man.  Not even thrown.  You know what he's seen?  Well, he's lived in Japan.  I mean, they get a little crazy there with some stuff.  Yeah, you know what?  One of my friends back in the day was kind of crazy, and he's one of them internet geeks,  and he showed me some crap eaters, and I was like, yeah, that's nugget bread to some stuff  I saw some Japanese people do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that's a weird culture over there. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, it's a weird culture.  You know, it's weird.  I can't talk no more about it.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  The Ultimate Fighter is Team Rampage versus Team 4, so you're saying it starts April 2nd  at 10 p.m., right?  Yeah.  On Spike TV?  Spike TV.  And your website is allrampage.com?  How do you know that?  We do a little research here.  Okay, yeah.  That's good, right?  Yeah, that's good.  Allrampage.com.  Allrampage.com.  It's always a pleasure there, Rampage.  Anytime.  I love you guys, man.  Y'all cool as hell. 
[01:56:00]  All right, cool.  Hey, tell the crackhead Jew I said, what's up?  All right.  We got, is Triple H coming up?  Triple H next.  Is he here?  Busy, busy show.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Yeah.  In studio, Triple H.  I don't do the angry pants, but it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, no, which mic do you want?  Of course, WrestleMania.  It's happening on Sunday.  Hey, believe it or not, Triple H, I was thinking about you the other night. 
[01:56:30]  I bet you were.  Well, not in that way.  It wasn't on this couch, was it?  No, not in that way.  I thought of you because you told a story on our show that I never forgot going back many years,  and I think this has happened to you now twice.  But I woke up in the middle of the night the other night because my calf muscle, this is a true story,  decided that it wanted to move toward my knee or down toward my ankle, something.  But the whole thing decided to move in the middle of the night. 
[01:57:00]  I wake up just screaming bloody murder.  My chick's like, whoa, what the F is up?  Did you just get stabbed by an intruder?  And then I have to grab the muscle with both hands and hold it in place so it doesn't, like, I don't know, rip.  Right, yeah.  It can rip off the bone, sure.  And this is the second time it's happened to me in the middle of the night,  and I always think about you because you told that story of your quadricep, like, rolling up like a shade.  Yeah, yeah.  Trust me, it's not something you want to do to that point.  His ripped off and went up, and you got a little cramp. 
[01:57:30]  No, I'm telling you, I'm not, I guess I am trying to relate a little bit, but it's more than a cramp.  You actually see the muscle completely move, and it's in a place on your leg where it's not supposed to be.  Like, what is that?  Yeah, I mean, I'm not really sure if they know what it is, but there is something you can take to prevent it.  I believe they call it mito.  It relieves your cramping, makes you feel better, you know what I mean? 
[01:58:00]  And that's even worse.  I expect that from you.  You had the same injury, like, that a professional wrestler got, but you got it just kind of laying there.  In bed, because I decided to stretch my toes too far in the middle of the night.  Kicking the blankie off of you.  Didn't that quadricep thing happen a second time to you or something?  Yeah, unfortunately.  Oh, damn.  And it actually rips off the muscle and then rolls up?  Yeah, well, when I did my right one, which was the second one,  I did in January of last year, it didn't roll up.  It tore off, but it actually kind of stayed in place, which was nice. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, good thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was still just as painful and just as bad.  I can't even imagine.  Yeah.  I can't even imagine the pain.  But actually, it makes the surgery go by, not the surgery itself,  but the recovery go by a little bit easier because there's less muscle trauma  because it doesn't end up near your hip.  Right, right.  They've got to pull it back down.  Yeah.  And I've seen them do a surgery when I was there.  You know, I spent nine months with Dr. Andrews in Birmingham, Alabama.  And so I got to see a bunch of surgeries, and I saw another wrestler, Kevin Nash, 
[01:59:00]  get his quad done.  And it's exactly what it looks like.  They go up there, and it looked like he pulled a little turkey neck out of the  incision hole.  And he was like, look at that, you know, through the window.  And then a bunch of them grab it, and they all pull on it.  Oh, tug of war.  One guy holds them, and the others all pull on the tendon until they can start working  with it.  It's just crazy.  Oh, wow.  We haven't seen you in a few years.  It's obvious wrestling is continuing to be very good to you, sir.  Yeah.  I see the really nice suits and stuff.  You used to come in here and just like, I don't know, flannels or something back in the 
[01:59:30]  day.  Yeah, look at you, all sharp-dressed and everything.  You used to spank broads for us, and now you're a married guy.  I think you've got a second kid on the way.  No, but I mean, if you want to bring some broads in here, I'm not opposed to that.  He's not opposed to that.  Yeah, you know, Joe over here that's with me, he'd like to get in on some of that.  We have a press conference this afternoon at Hard Rock at 12 o'clock, which all the fans  can come to, by the way.  So I'm all dressed up for that, you know.  Got to look spiffy.  Yeah.  WrestleMania is coming, you know. 
[02:00:00]  That's the big one.  Actually, we've been reading about it all day on the show, and it sounds like it's going  to be a good one.  It really does.  It's the big one.  And you're involved in the triple threat match there?  Triple threat match.  Me and Cena and Randy Orton for the WWE Championship.  Now, how is that going to work?  All three in the ring?  Same time.  Same time.  And last man standing wins.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, and the thing that's interesting about it that a lot of people like is that there's  a bit of jeopardy for the champion because he doesn't have to get beat.  I could beat Cena, who's not the champion, and win the title. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  So it's, you know, go any way.  Yeah.  There's no camaraderie between two more than anybody else?  No, we both hate Randy Orton, and I don't like Cena.  Okay.  Yeah, that kind of works.  Can I tell you the balls?  I really like this, actually.  The Triple H DVD, it's called Triple H, the King of Kings, which is kind of what Christ  calls himself.  I don't think he actually said it. 
[02:01:00]  It's just his publicity people.  Yeah, it was his people.  It's actually a book that didn't make it into the Bible where Christ put out like a memo.  He's like, I'd like to be called this.  But that's not my, I mean, he didn't trademark it.  He didn't get any of the legal stuff done.  I can't be held responsible for that.  Oh, that's a stupid copy.  You have copywritten that, I guess.  No, now I own it.  You know what I'm saying?  It's yours.  Here's the beauty of it.  I might sue the Catholic Church if you're using it.  We now have to pray to you, I guess.  All right, well.  It's not just the name.  It's Triple H on the cover, and on his head, instead of the crown of thorns, he has like 
[02:01:30]  a belt.  So it really is kind of very Christ-like, and the arms are kind of spread a little bit in  one of the wrestlers' pose, but it could be a very close-up of someone on the cross.  He does have the Jesus hair, which is good.  He's got the beard going on.  Yeah.  We can pick it up on something there, Jimmy.  I kind of like the fact that he just went balls to the wall and said, you know what?  That's the guy I want to model my seat.  I'm Jesus Christ.  But he always has.  Triple H has always gotten balls to the wall, man.  Yeah, you got to.  You know what I mean?  And we admitted this on our show. 
[02:02:00]  Like, we were huge into wrestling.  We took a few years off, and we're starting to get back into it.  Yeah, coming back.  What is changing that is getting people like us, I guess, back into wrestling?  Because, I mean, the popularity never went down that much.  No, you know, I think it's like any, to me, like any business or sport.  I mean, there are certain guys, you know, it's like basketball when you had the Larry  Birds and Magics and all those guys was this huge era in basketball.  And then those stars kind of left, and they're building new stars. 
[02:02:30]  And, you know, we had the Austins and the Rocks and the Mankinds.  And, you know, myself and Taker and Shawn Michaels and guys like that were in that realm.  But a lot of them left, and they retired, and they, you know, got out of the business.  And it's kind of almost you have to start over building a new fan base and get new people  into it and stuff.  You guys got so edgy.  We brought this up with you guys.  When you started delivering hands and all that stuff, I couldn't get enough of it.  And then, like, what happened?  I think the Giant Jackson thing kind of shut Vince down a little bit as far as the edgy 
[02:03:00]  stuff.  He had to pull back a little bit.  Yeah, I mean, you know.  But it seems like you guys are now pushing the envelope again, which is nice to see.  Yeah, there's a certain point in time there where, you know, Vince goes through phases  where he just wants to go straight out, and they can't tell me what to do with it.  You know, and then, you know, five years later, he's going, guys, high road.  You know what I mean?  Get off this crazy stuff.  We need to, you know.  Thinking of taking it a little highbrow.  We're going to go highbrow.  Oh, that's right.  All right, guys.  Balls to the walls. 
[02:03:30]  I want nudity.  I want women on their knees.  That's right.  Get on your knees.  That's awesome.  You're fine.  Oh, I love angry Vince.  The whole Kiss My Ass campaign.  One of my favorites ever.  Who didn't love the Kiss My Ass campaign?  What clipboard were we playing like last week or two weeks ago where they were being buffed?  Yeah, the buffing of the ass.  Yeah, the professional ass buffer before he got into the ring.  We were doing a promo once in the back, and it was being pre-taped, and I had no idea what 
[02:04:00]  he was going to say, and I'm supposed to be really angry, and I'm just giving him the  death stare, and he starts talking about how he's going into New York City, and most  people get a facial, but he's going to get an asshole.  An asshole?  We must have done 30 takes because I just couldn't stop laughing.  Every time he'd say something else, it just busts me up.  Oh, he's great.  What an ass.  I love him.  Oh, without a doubt.  You know what's great about him, too, is like, I mean, that's kind of him, you know,  people take him so seriously and stuff like that. 
[02:04:30]  He's like a big kid.  Yeah.  You know, and...  He never grew up.  No, it's, you know, like, I just, I said, I've said to him a million times, like, when  he'll do something completely outrageous, and I'll say, you think Bill Gates does his  thing over at Microsoft, you know what I mean, doing this stuff to his employees?  I don't think he does.  When he's standing there, and he puts the shocked Vince look on his face, when something  happens that so surprises him that he's just shocked, and the eyes get all big, and you  look at him and go, this guy is the head of a giant corporation. 
[02:05:00]  He's a billionaire.  He's out there just tearing it up still.  Well, and not only that, but, I mean, then, you know, when we do stuff like, you know,  every year, the last five years, we've gone to Iraq for holidays and stuff and visit troops,  you know, there's a guy, he's the head of a billion dollar industry or whatever, and,  you know, he trades in his suit, he's putting on a flak jacket and a helmet, and he's sitting  on a chopper next to us and, you know, running around in the dirt with all of us.  Yeah, get me into some action.  I want to kill some insurgents. 
[02:05:30]  That's right.  Come on.  Bring them on.  Bring them on.  Well, he does do it, and then he's, like, trying to talk them into, like, making the  helicopter do tricks.  He's insane.  It's like, no, come on.  This is real life, Vince.  Yeah.  He's out of his mind.  Has he ever come to you with an idea where you had to say, Vince, what the F?  What are you doing?  You're out of your mind now.  I got to stop you on this one.  Well, I mean, not only come to me with him, but then actually, like, got me to do this.  But was there one where you said, I just can't do this? 
[02:06:00]  I don't recall ever really saying no, but, like, I mean, there was ones.  I mean, I'll tell you a crazy story.  This is one of the most infamous storylines in our business that just, like, I still get  people commenting about how, like, it was just mortifying on so many levels.  For some reason, he got in his mind about telling these cockamamie stories, and I was  supposed to tell this story about how Cain had this girlfriend that he killed in a car  crash, and it was just insane.  And it ends up, I mean, I can't even believe I'm going to say I did this, is I'm at a funeral 
[02:06:30]  home with a dummy in a coffin.  Oh, my God.  I'm naked, except I've got a skin-colored thong on, right?  So that's what you can see.  With Cain's mask on, pretending I'm Cain, I'm on top of the coffin.  And having mock sex with this man.  Oh, my God, no.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  And Vince is yelling at me, God damn it, do it harder, make more noise and stuff.  It's got to be over the top.  And there's a funeral in the next room going on. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not kidding.  The funeral director just, like, opens the door and sticks his head and I look in.  I, like, look back.  I got this Cain mask on.  I'm buck naked.  I mean, how you doing?  Good to see you.  And he's like, oh, God damn.  One of those things, like, I just, like, when we left, I was like, I'm just, like, I can't  believe I just.  Yeah, what did I just do?  He wanted it more over the top.  Did he feel the sex with the coffin was too subtle?  Well, and he's yelling at me, you know, like, a lot of times, sometimes you can't ever win 
[02:07:30]  with him because one time he's yelling at you, more over the top.  And the next time you come back and more subtle, like, more and more, you know, I do stuff  at Subtle.  Subtle.  Subtle.  He doesn't do anything.  Right.  An ash-el.  Yeah.  An ash-el.  Now buff my ass.  You buff it.  I love that one.  Hey, he is the best.  Absolutely.  Getting back to WrestleMania, which is Sunday on pay-per-view.  I mean, Ric Flair going to retire finally. 
[02:08:00]  Come on.  You know what I'm going to.  Come on.  Is this finally?  I don't know what they're doing, but, you know, I mean, there's a part of me that hopes  so.  I mean, I love Ric to death.  He's one of my best friends, and, you know, the night before, he asked me.  I'm so honored to put him in the Hall of Fame, you know.  I mean, it's a guy I idolized growing up, and, but, you know, there's a point in time  where I just, you know, every time he goes in the ring, I'm holding my breath.  Really?  You know, is he going to get hurt?  Which, remarkably, he never does.  You know, when we did Evolution, we were together for I don't know how many years that  was, and I rode with him every single day, and I swear to you, you know, me and Orton 
[02:08:30]  and Batista getting out of the car all bent over, oh, my back's killing me, or my knees  are sore, or whatever.  We're all, you know, selling the, being on the road and stuff, and he's running around  strutting, wooing, and like, like nothing, like he never fell down a day in his life, you  know what I mean?  Amazing.  He's insane.  And guys don't take it easy on him because he's all the way there.  No, and honestly, he gets mad if you do try to take it easy on him, and half the time  that you're in the ring with him, he's wanting to do, like, just ridiculous stuff, like, you 
[02:09:00]  know, wanting to get thrown out on the floor, give me a suplex on the floor, like, no, I'm  not.  There's no need for that.  But he just wants to prove he can still take it, you know?  Right.  It's just, uh...  Wow.  I know he loves it, and I know...  It's been his whole life, yeah.  Yeah, and, you know, I mean, it's hard.  You know, I think about the day when I get to step out of that spot.  It's hard, you know what I mean, like, for anybody that does something that long, and  it's your passion of life, but there's a certain point in time where I think, you know, we all  want to remember him for what he is, not what he, you know, there's some shell of what he  is.  Yeah, if it gets to that point, it's always kind of sad. 
[02:09:30]  You don't want him to get to the Willie Mays.  Willie Mays.  We talk about Willie Mays and how, like, my favorite team's the Mets, and the Mets finally  got Willie Mays, and I'm just a kid.  I had no idea.  I'm like, wow, we got Willie Mays.  I didn't know at the time, he was like 48.  Yeah.  Could barely, you know, catch the ball anymore.  Yeah, he couldn't see it coming out of him.  Right.  It just gets sad, yeah.  Yeah, you don't want to get to that stage.  We got Sam, big wrestling fan in the studio.  Actually, he's going to blow off the show for, like, three days so he can go to WrestleMania. 
[02:10:00]  I don't know how he got that done.  Young Sam.  But, Sam, you got a question for Triple H?  You're always good with the question.  Yeah, sure.  How worried were you when you thought Vince McMahon was dead?  Oh, man, I was scared to death.  If I hadn't seen them pre-taped, we got in and out of the car.  Of course you're talking about the limo explosion.  We saw that and the fake leg just kind of dangling there to try to sell that Vince is in this limo. 
[02:10:30]  Well, no, the leg was real.  No, but then the door closed and then it opened again and then there was a fake leg.  That was really his leg.  What they did is he closed the door, he opened the door, he put his leg out, and then when he closed the door again, they just cut.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  To the explosion point.  Gotcha, gotcha.  What kills me is so many people call.  I mean, the office next day, like, people.  I'm not kidding you.  And they'll probably be mad at me for saying it.  Like, Trump called and was like, did something happen to Vince?  Did Trump not understand that that was a skit? 
[02:11:00]  The magic of television, you know what I mean?  Sam was selling it so much on the show, he couldn't get off of it, the fact that the investigators were there.  And I like how at first, like right after they said the FBI is investigating, and then it turned into some other investigative, what was it called?  The FIC.  The FIC stepped in, because I believe the FBI said, hey, don't involve us in this.  We don't want to be a part of your storyline. 
[02:11:30]  That was short for fictional.  Yes, fictional investigation.  We always just tweak it just a little.  One time we used, like, a delivery service, and I can't remember, it was like OPS or something like that.  And they're all guys that are just giant, massive guys that obviously are trying to get into the business.  And that's why whenever an ambulance shows up and they bring the gurney into the ring, it's just these massive guys.  You never see paramedics built like this.  Right, right.  Now we've actually started using real paramedics. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, are you doing that?  Most times, yeah.  But a lot of times when we do stuff like that, yeah, if you look closely, you can see where the guy has freshly shaved his goatee and covered up his tattoos and taken his earring out.  Hey, I loved that, though, when they blew up that car and it was just, you know, oh, my God, they can't find the body.  It must have been incinerated.  Well, you know what's great about our business, too, is I mean, one of the things about it, I've gotten to wreck cars, destroy motorcycles.  I mean, just, you get to every now and then just destroy some obscenely expensive piece of equipment, you know. 
[02:12:30]  Your highlight package is hilarious because Triple H is so freaking funny.  The stuff you do is just hilarious.  Yeah, it's, you know, over the years we've just done, sometimes I see stuff on packages and it makes me laugh and I'm thinking, I don't even remember doing that.  Yeah, yeah, right?  You go, yeah, that's kind of funny.  It makes you feel like an idiot laughing at yourself doing something, but sometimes you just don't remember ever doing that.  Well, also an idiot, yeah, because there's, seemingly, there's patches of my career where I'm, you know, if somebody will ask me about wrestling, somebody will be like, no, I've never been in the ring with him before. 
[02:13:00]  Sure you have, I have it on DVD.  It was?  Hey, how old is your kid now?  She'll be two in July.  Oh, two, okay, I was going to ask a hack question.  I've got another on the way.  Yeah, I know, I thought your kid was older.  I was wondering if, you know, she knows you're famous yet.  No, you know, she just came the other night, she came to a, well, she's always at the shows, but Steph brought her in for like, we were just at a live event somewhere and she just brought her in for like the second half of my match. 
[02:13:30]  And, uh, it's funny, she's only 20 months old, but she, she understood the whole concept.  Really?  Like, yeah, she got all excited when Sean made the tag and you know what I mean?  It was just, uh, she was going crazy.  And then she, we got on the bus afterwards and that's all she would talk about for like 45 minutes.  She just kept saying the same stuff over and over, you know, it was really fun.  Right on, man.  Yeah, she enjoys it.  But, you know, Steph has said that she's been a wrestling fan since before she was born because, you know, and I mean, it's got to be an adrenaline thing.  But every time when Steph would be at TV, when she was pregnant with her and she would, you know, sit down when the show was getting ready to start, the pyro would hit, the baby would start moving all crazy. 
[02:14:00]  Start rocking.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be an adrenaline.  But, you know.  One, one of my favorite moments with, uh, Stephanie was the, um, when she was chained in the basement.  This is so long ago.  And she was chained in there and crying and, and, and get me out.  And it was, it was pretty much her first foray into, you know, they brought her in.  And her acting was so bad.  We've goofed on her when she'd been on there, but it was like, oh my God, she's, please hit me out. 
[02:14:30]  You know, what's funny is like, you think about this.  That's fantastic.  I'm not sure how old she was.  I mean, she's pretty young, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Your dad was in something and like at 20, he said like, hey, um, tomorrow I need you to come to Orlando and we're going to put you on live TV.  Yeah.  Kidnapped by this guy and you've got to, you know, I mean, like.  How crazy is that?  Yeah.  What kind of business is that?  Yeah.  And I mean, it's just, you know, it's, uh, you have no experience doing it, but we need you to be professional about this. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Act.  Go ahead.  You're on.  It's crazy.  We've got to get out of here, unfortunately.  Yeah.  It's that time.  So what do we got, uh, Triple H?  It's, of course, WrestleMania Sunday on pay-per-view.  WrestleMania 24th this Sunday, live on pay-per-view, uh, from Orlando, Florida, the Citrus Bowl, 70,000 people.  It's going to be crazy.  And today at the Hard Rock, we're, uh, we've got the, um, press conference for WrestleMania.  Floyd Mayweather's going to be there.  All the WWE stars and the fans are welcome to come.  It's going to be, uh, going to be an event. 
[02:15:30]  You're going to, uh, show up there, uh?  Of course Sam will be there.  Young Sam will be there.  I'll be looking for your fro, man.  Look for that fro.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's part of a bit we're doing.  Ah.  Ah.  That lets your eyebrows grow out more, too.  Yeah.  They're like caterpillars.  It's like you just freshly shaved the middle, didn't you?  Like you just disconnected from it.  Yeah.  You got a unibra?  No.  All right.  Yeah, he does.  I think he does.  Triple H is really smashing you.  You got nothing to say?  Yeah.  Come on.  You were talking smack when he wasn't in here. 
[02:16:00]  Huh?  No.  No.  No.  His voice just went up three records.  Isn't that amazing?  Man, WrestleMania 24.  Yeah.  24 of them, and every one has just been a phenomenon.  It's, uh, it's one of those just iconic things that, uh, in this country.  It's become kind of bigger than the wrestling aspect of it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, celebrities are calling us.  They want to get involved.  They want to do something.  You know, I mean, it's great.  And, you know, a lot of people that watch, that might be the only pay-per-view they watch  for us the entire year, but they love it, you know? 
[02:16:30]  You can also look back at some of the early ones, and it's really nostalgic to, uh, see  what was going on in the country at the time, you know, when you'd have Sergeant Slaughter  and, uh, uh, the Iron Sheik going at it.  And you see some of the stars that are there, Liberace, Reynolds, you know what I mean?  Like, just crazy.  It's hysterical, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, very cool.  Did they have to drag him out of the, drag him out of the dressing room, kicking the  screen?  What the hell was he doing there?  Actually, I think he came out on his own.  He was doing the can-can the whole way down. 
[02:17:00]  All right, we got to get out of here.  Triple H, always a pleasure.  You know that.  Thanks so much, man.  WrestleMania Sunday on pay-per-view.  We're out.  Oh, I think I saw boo!

[02:21:30]  Here we are  XM Satellite Radio  We got a nice surprise  Triple H has decided to make the walk over  And he's sitting in our studio  What's up, guys?  To discuss WrestleMania  Well, nah, we did that already  Now let's get into the good shit  Yeah  Fuck it  We can sit where over here  Yeah  I'm just trying to adjust stuff  Because we haven't been here in a while  But a couple things 
[02:22:00]  Jimmy offered Triple H a cookie  He's not gonna eat a cookie  Before WrestleMania  Well, Triple H is a man  Who spends a lot of time in the gym  And I was gonna ask you a question  That's funny  I went to walk in and ask him  What do you do for abs?  And I was too embarrassed  Because I was eating a cookie  I was just gonna say  Stop eating the cookies  Would be number one  That's the first step  I've been pretty good, though  But I do at least 35 minutes  Of the elliptical machine  I mean, you know  And he thinks he's ready  To show off his abs, you know  He's gotten rid of about  Half the cookies he's eaten  Yeah  Rampage Jackson said 
[02:22:30]  He spends five hours  In the gym a day  Or something like that  When he's training for a fight  And you're like  Well, I can relate  I do 35 minutes  Yeah, Rampage understands  And I feel like  I can eat anything I want  At that point  I really do  I'll eat cake  At 3 o'clock in the morning  And go, well  You got that 30 minutes  Ahead of you tomorrow  I truly am an idiot  And no offense  But, you know  I mean, Rampage can say  All he wants  But the results  Speak for themselves  Clearly  Clearly, right?  Clearly  The physical specimen  That sits before us now  Jimmy  I have surprisingly good legs  Like, I have very good calves  And so  So the foundation's there 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, below the waist  I'm fine  You play golf?  No, I don't  Okay  Well, Jimmy does something  That a lot of golfers do  Like, there's a thing  Called a mulligan  A crappy shot  You're like  Ah, hangover mulligan  Like, you make excuses  It's a do-over  It's a do-over  Which is not a real thing  In golf  But people do it  Jimmy does that  With treats  You threw a cookie down  And you called it a what?  A post-vacation treat  That was what Sam called it  And I felt that  When a man's been on vacation  For seven to eight days  And I actually showed up  For work today on time  I deserve two cookies 
[02:23:30]  One in the morning  And one out  He does dessert mulligans  He makes up excuses  Why it's okay  You didn't have any treats  While you were on vacation, right?  Very minimal  I actually am a pretty good eater  With the exception of  The amount of mercury  I eat due to all the salmon and stuff  But I eat fairly well  I should be disgusting  He's eating cookies  He's worried about his mercury  I don't wear condoms either  That's the beauty of me  I worry about mercury  But where's she from?  Haiti?  She's fine  We found out a lot about you today  You don't use condoms 
[02:24:00]  You have nice legs  Yeah  That's more information  Than I needed on you this morning  Also there's plenty more  Where that came from  Jimmy has the best calves  In the business  Yeah  So what do you do for your abs?  Seriously  I'm asking a professional guy  Who's in tremendous shape  I mean besides  The eating stuff  But like what do you  Your abs  The biggest thing is diet  And yeah  I mean it's body fat  Everybody's got abs  They're all  It's there  It's just what's covering it  It's what's underneath  Yeah  It's underneath all that crap  Yeah unfortunately for guys  That's where we  You know that's  Your fat storage area  Right  Where girls get the fat ass  And the big thighs 
[02:24:30]  Because the center of gravity  Is a little bit  Yeah we got our own  Problem area  Yeah  Our caution  You got it  Yeah you get  I heard the biggest thing is  Like what you eat  It's just eating  Because you  That's half the battle  Yeah I mean even  Even you know like  Bodybuilders and stuff  Will tell you  It's like you know  You can train  And do all the other stuff  All you want  But if you don't eat  Right  I mean it's half the battle  Everything else means nothing  Triple H also reminded us  That we need to talk  In more detail  About what Sam did  For the TV pilot yesterday  For Comedy Central  Get Sam in here  Oh that's 
[02:25:00]  Poor Sam  Who's a behind the scenes guy  But knows the show very well  And brings the wrestlers in  And Triple H  They both know Sam  Because he's an obsessed  Wrestling fan  He's a bit obsessive  Right  Triple H  He is  And we walked over here  And I'm a bit disturbed  About the story  That he told me  Quite honestly  Oh you didn't tell him that  Did you  Well  My friend Joe here  Decided to bring up  That we did a little TV pilot  In front of Triple H  Oh now it's we  We  You were 10 seconds 
[02:25:30]  You certainly did something  It was a memorable 10 seconds  It might last a lifetime too  A very short lifetime  Before he tells you what it was too  He tells us as he's telling us  He's like  And then they convinced me  To do this  And I said like  How much did you get paid  And he goes  Oh nothing  Nothing  I don't even know if I'll get anything  Something kind of convincing  Yeah  What did they convince you with  Well we told it earlier  But we could really have fun with this  On this side  The dirty side of the show  Go ahead  What did you do for the TV pilot yesterday 
[02:26:00]  Well  Bob Kelly went around  And tried to find  Men to kiss me  And  Some homeless man  Who was a gay homeless man  Obviously  Was following us around  Because he heard  Bob Kelly was  Offering me  As a prize  Started  You know  You would be a catcher  I know  They followed him  Like the Pied Piper  Right  2,000 fruits  With  Fucking their zippers open  Hoping for a shot  He is a little  Cherub  Twinkish thing 
[02:26:30]  Isn't he  I'm not gay  And I'd fuck  Two of his three holes  Oh god  Wow  Jesus Christ  Jimmy  I'm including ears  Alright  I was trying to figure out  Which  I know  But I'd already  Committed to the bit  Before I realized  He's only got one  I was thinking  Colostomy bag myself  I wasn't sure  What was wrong  With young Sam  He's got a fake eye  You guys have never noticed  Yeah  He's like Sandy Duncan  Just pop it out  And fucking drink  So Sam  So this guy  Comes up  And Bob says  That he's the perfect guy  For this 
[02:27:00]  For this role  And you know  He starts saying  Yeah I'll do it  I'll do it  And he had some accent  He was horribly drunk  And then we started asking him  Well you know  Where's his mouth been  Where's his mouth been  Hold on a minute  But first  Explain  You didn't do a good job  The first time  And we had to convince you  To kiss a guy  Better  No well  That's jumping ahead  A little  Oh well  Excuse me  You know  We said  You know  Where's his mouth been  Ha ha ha  And he said  Hey I'll tell you  Where my mouth's been  It's been on the glory holes 
[02:27:30]  And all morning long  Right  Yeah  He was bragging that  He wasn't in there  Just for a little  A little  A little  A little time  All morning long  And he was the one  Giving the  The blowjobs  Through the glory hole  Yeah  I mean  Not all morning long  It's like 4 o'clock  In the afternoon  By this point  Put in a hard day's work  This guy  Yeah  He looked like  He ate a glazed donut  At that point  Yeah  Absolutely  He said he had  Just gotten back  From two glory holes  Oh  Two  Two  So then 
[02:28:00]  They said  Yeah he's the perfect guy  And I hesitated  Is that how they convinced you  No  I'm wondering  Like  No he's been at the glory holes  Oh  Pucker up buddy  No I hesitated  And  They kept  You know  Saying  You gotta do it  Barely hesitated  By the way  I was hesitating  Peer pressure  Do you try to not sound like a homo  In front of Triple H  Well I did hesitate  Before I kicked the guy  I would be blowing a lot of people  Well guess what  Triple H wouldn't even get to that point  No he wouldn't  But  But then  So yes  They said  Alright let's do it 
[02:28:30]  And I said  Okay  Let's do it  For the  You know  Good of the show  For your pride  Yeah  And then I kissed him  On the lips  Or he kissed me  And then  Bob  And then I pulled back  Immediately  Right  So then Bob Kelly  What did you pull back  No my  Whole body  Everything  And then Bob Kelly  Goes  No we gotta get a better one  And I started screaming  That that was good enough  That was good enough  And they said  No no  And everybody said  No no  And I'm a weak minded person  So I said 
[02:29:00]  Alright you guys are right  So by a better one  What did they mean  I think they wanted like a long  Ah a little longer  And then while they're debating  Whether or not they're gonna do  A second kiss  This guy like hugs me  And starts nuzzling in my neck  Which was like at that point  I'm like what are you guys doing to me  This guy is psychotic  And then he you know  He got away  We're just trying to make good TV  Relax  What kind of show is this  I don't know  What the hell's wrong with you  So this guy is psychotic  Not you  The guy out  Kissing homeless people  For no apparent reason  Yeah  You're not 
[02:29:30]  Just for the show  Yeah  So you had a longer  Kiss with the gentleman  Yeah they tried to count to three  But I  I only got to two  Oh well then  Okay  And then you came  He had a slight shiver  And he just walked away  A slight shiver  He left the other guy hanging  A lady trucker writes  Sam's fro  Great for cleaning homeless ass  No it's not  No  I don't know  Because I wouldn't  Well I think we might have to try it 
[02:30:00]  If this show gets picked up  I think that's a good idea  It's a bad idea  Sam was pissed too  Because he's pretty sure  The blowjob's never going to make air  Yeah I'm sorry about that  But standards and practices  You know  They got a hold of the tape  Sam  Sure I've done  It should be known  That you did indeed blow the guy  No it should be known  But we're not going to be able  To show that on TV  Triple H's  But this wasn't  This wasn't the only man  You kissed that day  Well no  Because then  As soon as it was finished 
[02:30:30]  Everybody cheered  Yay yay  And I coughed up a little bit  And then  What the semen?  Just a little  And then Bob Kelly  Put his two mitts on my cheeks  And just pulled my face in  Oh can you slow down a little bit  This is getting hot  No  Yeah  Let's hear the story  Yeah Bob Kelly  Gave me a big kiss  Right on the lips too  How long that one last?  I don't know  I was blacked out at that point  Wow  He had a roofie  Someone slipped him a roofie  He blacked out at that point  When he woke up  His banter down  His butt was greasy 
[02:31:00]  He's not sure what went down  No  Sam  Obviously I gotta ask you  Who was a better kisser?  Yeah  Well Bob Kelly  Had smokers breath  How fucking hilarious  Hold on a second now  Hold on a second  So the guy with  Cock and ball breath  Was okay  I didn't smell it  So strong  Oh wow  Really  Been eating a semen sickle all day  And you're worried about the cigarette smoke 
[02:31:30]  Oh my god  He doesn't like cigarette breath  What's wrong with you?  When it comes to your gayness  Is it like your blackness  You're just like slightly gay  Or are you all in at this point?  Two days ago I would have told you  I'm not gay  Not even a little bit  But at this point  Maybe  You're a little confused about your sexuality  That's okay  You're a young man  You have a lot of time to think it out  You're basically saying  When you kiss the homeless guy  Something moves  That you weren't  You weren't expecting  It's wrong with it or anything  If that's the direction you want to go in 
[02:32:00]  That's fine  There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle  I mean you should explore it  Run downstairs  I saw some bums on the street corner  On the way in  Give it a whirl  Yeah  We'll drill a hole in the studio wall  Over there  Have at it  That'd be great  If we just turned this kid out  Don't worry  But he can only get turned on  From homeless dick  If you had an apartment  He'll never go near you  He's the homeless dick kid  Becomes a legend in the city  He's on the street corner  Scratching him  So hey I'll blow you for nothing  Yeah it just started as a dumb innocent thing 
[02:32:30]  For a TV pilot  And now it's like  He's all in  I kind of like it  Yeah the Comedy Central liked it so much  They're going to have a segment  Who is Sam going to kiss next  What?  Yeah  We're writing it as we speak  It's got to be  No I don't know about that  Maybe we're going to get different Sams  No  Every week there'll be a different man  Yeah  And you have to kiss  Kiss the man  Yeah  That's a wonderful story  No it's not  I'll kiss a man Sam I am  Are you embarrassed to tell the story 
[02:33:00]  In front of Triple H?  Yes  Yes I am  I would not blow you in a house  I would not  Has Sam made you  Triple H  Has Sam made you sign the chair  Yes I just signed the chair  They're not made  No you're making all these guys feel awkward  You carry a chair around  That's autographed by everybody  It's impressive yes  But it's embarrassing  Could have been worse  He could have asked to kiss me  Yeah  You know what I mean  So I'm feeling my height  No I'm not saying  That I want to kiss more guys 
[02:33:30]  What I am saying is  Normally if you go up to a straight guy  And say  Have you ever kissed another man  They'll say no and recoil  But I now have to say yes to in one day  True yeah  Which confuses me  You always have that with you now  Two in a ten minute span  Yeah  One day  This was fucking immediate  You were a slut  Yeah at this point  At this point you're a sloppy party bot  In my eye  Yeah  Sam's a cock whore  Yeah  It's like he just lets them line up  One after the other  Yeah  Until he's fucking overflowing 
[02:34:00]  Bob just grabs you  Yeah that was more of a rape  Than anything else  Because Bob Kelly  Obviously just wanted to do it so much  Yeah  Well Bob's always had an eye for you  I think  You think  Bob's a little something  Going on with Bob  Yeah  Bob's a bit gay  Bob Kelly is a little experimental  He's got a bit of the gay  Bob's not gay like  We've all done a few trannies  I mean that's  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  Slow down a little bit  A tranny is what's called  The burden of every gentleman  But Bob just  Bob wants tenderness 
[02:34:30]  Bob doesn't even want to like  Yeah  Get blown by a tranny  He wants to hold another man's face  He wanted to nuzzle  And just snuggle with you  Yeah  Bob's a sissy  He's gone from cookies  To sexy legs  To just trannies now  Oh yeah  The natural progression  That's the way it works  That's known  Yeah of course  You have no idea  Jimmy and trannies are just  Everyone in trannies  Jimmy why don't you tell Triple H  What your favorite thing is  What?  For the ladies to do to you  Uh  Not press charges 
[02:35:00]  Yeah right  What do you mean?  I don't know  When you have to lay down plastic  And stuff  I think Triple H  Could appreciate  A nice story like this  Hey you know what  It's  He wants  No  You know what  We've all been pissed on  And you act like it's weird  It is actually  Weirdly embarrassing  But you know  Whatever  I actually  You know I mean  That's not as bad  As what it could have been  Because you were  You know he's talking about  Trannies and stuff  I thought you were going to say  What's the favorite thing  For chicks to do to you  He was going to say  Slap me in the face  With their dicks  Oh no 
[02:35:30]  No no  Absolutely not  Plus they always want  Extra for that  Why waste it on the cheek  Right Jimmy?  Jim just says  Inadvertently  At some time  When he's getting  Oral favors  He might  Put his hand  On the  What he believes  To be a girl's back  And rub a little bit  And think  Wow that's a  Scout back  We've all had  This girl has a  Triple H back  I don't have triple H  Because they're usually black  And the wig falls off  And they look like  Cleavon Little  You're like  Oh you got me 
[02:36:00]  You got me  Surprise daddy  Yeah  Like the one from  Fucking Injustice for All  Mr. Kirkland  Should not be out  On probation  The worst tranny ever  Oh my god  Sorry Sam  I didn't mean to divert  To my fucking  Mail on mail experience  What the hell's going on  In this place  Sam's listening to this  Like it's penthouse forms  He's digging it  Oh man  You getting hard Sam  No  You sure  The fact that Bob  Grabbed your face  How long did Bob 
[02:36:30]  Kiss you for  I know  Longer than I would have liked  Did you have to  Pull away from Bob  Yeah oh yeah  He would have just  Stayed there  And probably  Tongue kissed  He would have easily  Gone to third base  Right there  Did his mouth open  A little bit  Yes  He tried  Yeah he was opening  Bob doesn't play  He's bisexual  Yeah he's bisexual  You're convinced of it right  Absolutely  Yeah I think we all are  He's got proof  Yeah  Well you do understand  You're probably  You fall into that category  Of a cherubish  You're like you know 
[02:37:00]  I thought you were going to say bisexual  Well no I wasn't going to say bi  Okay  I was going to say full  You're full on now  Do you still have a girlfriend  Yeah  She's called a beard now  No  She's called a beard  I'm stealing Travis's gimmick now  What do you mean  Never saw Travis kiss a guy  I'll tell you that much  No man  Hold a cat in a real fruity picture  Yeah but he's a lesbian  Here's the greatest part  He's a girl  And he's married to a girl  Which is very interesting 
[02:37:30]  A girl from Canada  I don't know how you got that done  Being a girl yourself  It's  They allow that up there  Yeah  When this day ends  And Wrestlemania's happening  Sam has to go out there  And he's going to have to see  Triple H  And this like  Our moment here  Is going to be over  Yeah  And you're going to have to  Make eye contact with him  And you know he's going to be thinking  Hey  Bagot  That's exactly what he's thinking  He won't say it  Yeah he'll  That's what he's thinking  He's going to like  Interact with you  Because we're still on the radio  Here's another thing  As soon as the mics go off  You're done  Here's another thing  That hair of yours  Stands out in the crowd 
[02:38:00]  Yeah  So if you see Triple H  At some point  Lean over  And talk to another wrestler  And they both look at you  He'll be  He'll have just told him  That guy sucked  Hobo  Hobo  Dick  Yeah yeah  Triple H  You know he's getting into the wrestling  He's actually part of a  What league?  The New York State Wrestling Federation?  Oh  You don't know about those guys?  Is that it?  And he's doing  What is it called?  A kissing match 
[02:38:30]  That's right  Get in the ring and make out  I'm just a guest judge  A guest judge  In a boxer versus wrestling match  You're going to keep it sexy  Now get in that ring  And start kissing that homeless guy  You're going to kiss him  And he just got through  With a glory haul  I don't want to do that anymore  You don't want to do it anymore  No  No?  But he's  But he's talking smack  And everything  Oh yeah 
[02:39:00]  He's doing  What is it called?  I cut a promo  I cut a promo  Oh you cut a  What's your gimmick name?  Primetime Sam Roberts  Original  Butt burglar  Sam the open mouth robber  No it's primetime  Yeah primetime  Primetime  Yeah  Yeah  Kind of rolls off the tongue  I don't think Triple H  So does Jism  I don't think Triple H  Started his wrestling career 
[02:39:30]  By kissing homeless guys  No  You guys need to have a contest  Or something  Come up with a better gimmick  For him  Yeah  But see I feel like  They'll mostly be centered  Around the fact  That I kissed that homeless man  If they do that  Yeah  Probably would  Gay Art Garfunkel  Art Garfunkel  He doesn't know who that is  I know  I've heard the Art Garfunkel  I liked it better  When I was just  The weird kid  With the big hair  Now I'm the weird gay kid  With the big hair  Well you said it  Whatever you do 
[02:40:00]  You know when you're kissing men  Multiple men  Out on the streets  Of New York City  I was going to say  Were you supposed to feel  Bad for you for that  Yeah  So Bob had bad breath  Yeah  Smokers breath  It's hilarious  That really is funny  That's the thing  That stood out for him  Yeah  And what you're saying is  If he hadn't smoked  You'd have enjoyed it more  Than if he had smoked  Yes  You'd have enjoyed it more  If he didn't have cigarette breath  You have a problem with more  You have a problem with nicotine  Yes  Not cum  Well  Both I'll say  What?  Both? 
[02:40:30]  Okay  Would you have enjoyed that more?  That's a good question  If Bob had Lavorist  Right before  Would you have been pulled back  Slightly slower?  Maybe  Maybe a little  Oh  Not  Because it wouldn't have been like  Oh nicotine breath  But  It still would have been  You know  A guy  Yeah  They're calling you  Puddle of AIDS  Writes  Oral Roberts  I don't like that one  And gaping Sam Roberts  Is coming in  From awful me  Gaping  We'll give you a choice  You could be  Gaping Sam Roberts 
[02:41:00]  Or Oral Roberts  Oral Roberts is pretty funny  I guess  You know the tie in  Oral Roberts  Aren't you supposed to be like  Buff if you're gonna like  Join the wrestling world  Yeah  Kind of prime time  Do you have a finish yet?  Do you have like  A finishing move?  Like the teabag  Or something like that?  Sam's finishing move  As he goes  Gulp  There he goes  With the Roman war helmet  Oh my god  He swallowed  The wrestling twink  It's over 
[02:41:30]  I've never done anything like that  Oh his fucking  The zipper in his suit's in the back  Everyone tries to pin him  The wrong way  Yeah Sam  I mean  You can't just be  A guest referee  You're gonna have to  Get into the action  And you don't really  Lift or anything  Well I mean  I guess I could start  Right?  I got potential  Don't I?  For what?  Right now  You look like  The top rope  Yeah  God damn 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  Triple H is  Beating you up  Pretty good  I could be one of those  Like wiry high flyers  Wiry high flyers  Yeah  Yeah  No  No  I don't see it  You're really  Let me see your arm  Let me just see your arm  Okay  And I just want to say  How quickly he started  To peel off his clothes  Oh yeah  He can't wait to get  His clothes off real quick  Putting your bed on 
[02:42:30]  It looks like you have  A string hanging from your shirt  But it's actually your arm  Hey fucking pasta limbs  He's giving you good beating  Hey that's angel hair pasta  What do you have to say  About your beating  You're taking from Triple H  You're a hero  It's well deserved  Yeah  That's not what you're saying  You know  Behind the scenes  What do you mean?  You have a lot of smack  To talk to  About Triple H  I would never talk smack  About Triple H  What do you say?  When he comes in here  I'm going to kiss him 
[02:43:00]  Right on the lips  Hey I'll show him  Yeah  You can't talk to me like that  I'll make out with you all day  Sam any more questions  Because we've got to get  Triple H out of here  They've got the big  Press conference  What?  Noon at Hard Rock?  Joe  Noon at Hard Rock  Yeah  Are you enjoying  The Triple H appearance there Joe?  I am very much enjoying  The Triple H appearance here  And I'm a little nervous  That Sam is standing behind me  Yeah  I've got to be quite honest  The funny thing is  Every time you turn 
[02:43:30]  And look away from me  He licks his lips  Just so slightly  That's not true  He is salivating behind you  You wouldn't even enjoy it Joe  Because the whole time  You'd be known  He's just blowing you  To get to Triple H  Because you feel so used  And dirty  He is looking at you  Like right now  Like he looked at  That plate of cookies  That was in there earlier  Yeah  A little frosting  On those cookies maybe  No  No  I have a question  For Triple H  It's not  Is this going to lead  To another fight? 
[02:44:00]  Oh no  Did you ever get tempted  To get involved  Because I know  In MMA  At all  I know they're talking  About a lot more wrestlers  Might go in that direction  Or does that hold  No interest for you?  Nah  You know  I just don't understand  The attraction  That stuff's so fake  You know  I don't know  I don't know how people  Can watch it  You know what I mean  It's just  I mean it's so clear  That it's just phony  I mean I know  One time I was watching  And I saw the two guys  Going  It really looked like  Somebody might have  Slipped and punched  The other guy  And they really got mad 
[02:44:30]  And started  But yeah  It's just so phony  I don't know  I can't get into it  I hate how they try  To sell it like it's real  Yeah  It's just you know  It just insults  Your intelligence  I don't get it  You're right  They are pussies  Tap tap  Fuck you  What do you think  Of Brock Lesnar?  You know  I saw the fight  I mean  You know  It's unfortunate  That in  You know  I guess like  In boxing or something  You usually start out  With the lower talent  And build your way up  You know  Go in there  And start with a guy  That was the world champion  And just  You know 
[02:45:00]  Hope you do well  I mean he did good  For the first like  You know  Minute I guess  And then  He's got to figure out  That floor shit  Yeah  I guess that's the thing  You know  That's such a science too  And there's  I mean so much stuff  Going on  And you know  That's a difficult business  But you know  Brock's got a lot of personality  And he's got a lot of charisma  And he's got a  Certainly got a look  Yeah  That if he can come back  And do well  In some of his other fights  You know  I personally would have  Gone the other direction  When he got done the fight  He kind of  Tried to play the humble 
[02:45:30]  Bumble part  And you know  Well I'm going to try harder  And you know  Learn more  And come back  I think he should have  Gone the other way  And just  Shit on all those guys  Right  And let them get so mad  That they would have been  All those fans  Would have been so pissed off  They'd have paid anything  To come back  And see him get beat again  You know what I mean  Yeah true  Rampage commented on that  Though like  On the shit talking element  He said that they don't  Do it a lot  Because he goes  There was a Brazilian dude  They actually booted out  Because the guy was  Kind of shit talking  At the press conference  And so when it came  To choking him  The guy was trying to tap  And the Brazilian guy 
[02:46:00]  Wouldn't stop  Just kept choking him  Those guys don't play games  You don't have a fucking  Broken shin  They had to kick him  Out of the league  Yeah  Right  Yeah they don't  They don't talk  A whole lot of shit  Hey Triple H  What are you going to do  After wrestling  I mean you guys stay  In the entertainment business  Because you got  Triple H has something man  I mean you're hilarious  But you know what  For me  I mean I enjoy  The wrestling business so much  I'm sure I'll stay  Doing something  And of course  It's also  You know  Now part of my family  So that's a big thing for me  But you know  You know I don't know 
[02:46:30]  I enjoyed  I made the movie  When I did Blade  I enjoyed doing it  But it wasn't something  That I would want to leave this  To go do full time  Just because  It's just a different world  There's so much  Waiting around  And sitting around  It's kind of boring  I could see  If Vince ever steps down  You just become  Like the new Vince  And control the whole  Fucking thing  That's your antics  Get an ashul  And like  I could so see you  Stepping right into that  And being just huge  Well you know what  The thing is though  Vince will probably  Outlive all of us  Oh yeah  He's not leaving  Yeah  He is not leaving 
[02:47:00]  Anytime soon  He'll be 100 years old  Grapping his diapers  On TV  Someone throwing him  Out of the ring  Change my diaper  How long has he been  At it now  Because I remember  Being a kid  And he would be  Interviewing like  Andre the Giant  Standing on a box  Standing on a box  To make himself  Look like he was  Taller and stuff  But early 70s  Or something like that  Yeah yeah  Probably yeah  I mean you know  His dad owned  The promotion first  And then you know  A lot of people think  Vince just was given  This big promotion  You know like  Here's the wrestling  Thing do what you want  With it  But it wasn't true 
[02:47:30]  His dad didn't want him  To get into it at all  Right  And he had to prove himself  And then he bought it  From his dad  On like  His dad made a deal  With him like  Yeah you pay me  All this money  In installments  But if you miss  One installment  I keep all the money  And I get the product back  You know what I mean  Like and  So it was really  Hard ass  Yeah I mean  He really made him  You know  Take it  But you know  I mean he did  And he  Vince a risk taker  You know  He just  He'll roll the dice  All the time  And hope for the best  And you know  People can make fun of him  About the XFL  You know  And not only that 
[02:48:00]  But not only start  A football league  But look at the NFL  And go  You know what  Fuck you  Hey you don't have  To convince us  We signed on  We drank the Kool-Aid  But it was a hell of a shot  That's what we tell people  Who else had the balls  To look ridiculous  On NBC  At prime time  Yeah but you roll  You roll those dice  I mean if it would have worked  I mean holy shit  Right  And as far as  Wrestling goes  Vince took it in a direction  That it just wasn't going  And you know  It was pretty much  The complete laughing stock  Years ago 
[02:48:30]  In the 70's  And stuff  And Vince brought it  And made it  A legitimate entertainment form  Sure  Where it was like  You know  Okay  We're going to  We're going to let you in  On a little secret here  But these guys are taking  Huge bumps  And you know  And the storylines  Got so entertaining  To watch  The guy really is  A genius  When it comes to that  And even just taking it global  And realizing the fact  That instead of all these  Little areas  There should be one brand  For the whole world to see  I mean that was  Ingenious at the time  Don McMahon  Yeah  I want to be the godfather 
[02:49:00]  He did  He like united everything  Yeah  He brought it all together  And you know  And then I mean  Really  I've been to these  Pay-per-view conventions  And stuff  For that industry  And when they talk about it  They talk about him  As like the guy  That basically  Almost started pay-per-view  It was like  Yeah  You know what I mean  Because he really  Broke ground on that  And got it rolling  Without that  It would have never  You know  There wouldn't get pay-per-view  So I mean  It's a big deal  Perfect timing  Great  Thanks Kenny  I want to see that  Bastard sometime  Got to get him in here 
[02:49:30]  Yeah we haven't seen him  In a while  Yeah  You know what  He loves it  I actually was talking  To him last night  Because he's going to be  At the press conference  Today  Which did I mention  It's at noon  Yeah noon  At Hard Rock's  Cafe  Manhattan  I don't think  You have to promote that  I think you're set there  Yeah they had people  Waiting outside last night  I'm sure  They're animals  Really  Yeah  Dude the wrestling fans  Are animals  I've been to a bunch  Of WrestleManias  And they line up  I don't know  A week ahead of time  Or something ridiculous  I mean I know  It's like a cliched thing  People say it all  We have the greatest fans  Of any business  They're animals  I mean they just are 
[02:50:00]  It's  Yeah but they're also  The strangest looking too  Well  Some of them  But you know what I mean  We get them from  All walks of life  You've been to some  Of our appearances  We get them from  All walks of life  But I mean it's just  They're just  You know they're  The most dedicated  The most loyal  They'll show up  To everything  And just yell  And scream  And have a good time  And that's what  They're there for  Have a good time  Obviously dedicated  Where's the clip  Of that guy  I love this guy  You ever see  The clip of this guy  You've had to  Where's E-Rock  You've never heard 
[02:50:30]  Wrestling fan  E-Rock's gotta get it  And I don't even care  Like why this guy  Had such emotion  Going on  It's just the fact  That he just  Lost his mind  But now he's like  Capitalizing on it  He's got t-shirts  And stuff that he sells  And a website  Where's E-Rock  He's finding it  We gotta get  Triple H out of here  Here we go  You've had to  Have heard this  He was at some  Kind of a gymnasium  There were a few  Wrestlers there  I don't even know  Who they were  Terry Funk was there 
[02:51:00]  Okay  I think  I think Harley Race  Was there  Listen to this  And he starts  Talking  And he gets  A little choked up  I just  Want to thank  Each and every  One of y'all  For all you've  Done to your bodies  It's still  Real to me  Dammit  I'll be  Thank you  Thank you  Take it easy man  Thank y'all guys  Y'all are awesome  Thank you so much  Mr. Funk  For saying  What needed to be said  I don't want to  See another  One of these  Well thank you 
[02:51:30]  I was like  Take it easy man  I like the one guy  I was like  Take it easy man  You know he wants  To say something else  It's still real to me  Dammit  And that's what  I guess that's what  The t-shirt is  That he sells  It's still real to me  Dammit  T-shirts  What's funny about that too  Is like here's this guy  Right obviously he idolizes  All these guys  He stands up in front of them  And they're all like  Oh Christ  Jeez somebody  Get this guy out of here  Take it easy man  Alright we got you  What time's the  Fucking limo  Get me out of here 
[02:52:00]  Awkward  We love  It's on the same disc  Like when  Athletes retire  So now we just  Gotta play the  Mike Schmidt for them  We find excuses  To play the  Mike Schmidt  Retirement speech  It's quick  And Triple H  If the time  Ever comes  Please don't do this  Do retire  Don't do this  Alright alright  Okay  This is what you should not do  Brett Favre did this  Yeah  Recently  He was trying not to  But it happens to all  Some reason it happens  It happens to all the greats  Some 18 years ago  I left Dayton Ohio 
[02:52:30]  With two very bad knees  And a dream to become  A major league baseball player  Oh no  I thank god  The dream came true  Nah see  You don't want to be that guy  How big could he have  Turned that around  And beat him  And thank god  The dream came true  Cause I made millions  That's what you should not do  I take you suckers  To the bank 
[02:53:00]  That's right  Yeah like  Do something like that  Don't end on  That note  I got a theory  Why all these  Great athletes cry  When they get  When they retire  Cause they know now  They're not gonna be  On the road anymore  Banging all the  And they're like  Fuck I'm gonna be  Stuck at home  And I have no excuses  Left  Girls never suck  The dick in the  Batting coach  It's like now  I gotta come up  With excuses  Why I gotta go to  Tampa for the weekend  Girls won't

[03:07:30]  With us  His head is bleeding  Like that  Oh my god  He thought he was privileged  He thought we were going to talk about the pilot  We filmed yesterday for Comedy Central  And quite frankly  Eastside Dave was a star  Yes  And he thought he was coming in here  To talk about that  And we ambushed him  And we completed Afro Wars  By shaving his head  It didn't count  Remember this  Afro Wars  You started these sneaky tactics Dave  No no no  This is your own  That was fun and games 
[03:08:00]  This is fun and games baby  This is the end of the game  Game over Dave  Just a fucking parade of  300 pound men dragging the bull down  The horns are coming out Sam Roberts  The horns are out  And they've pinned you down to the floor Dave  I wish I could talk  But Clipsaw and Kenny's cock  Is two inches from my mouth  You started this Dave  Dave you started it  We ended it  He's sitting on my fucking nipple ring 
[03:08:30]  That I did for your television show  Can you please let him off my nipple ring  It's going to be infected with sweat  I thought we were piercing your ball bag  For the TV show  The guy wouldn't do it  Oh you wouldn't do it  So we got a nipple ring  No I was willing to do it  Because the bull's always willing to do it  Alright sit up  If you go after anyone though  You're done  Oh we really need to get the back of your head  Will you let that  He looks silly  Alright one  Alright one  Sit down  Sit down  Sit down  You use that mic 
[03:09:00]  I can't talk into my mic  Because Dave was drooling and spitting on it  While he was talking  Alright Dave  The haircut is terrific  Actually it's perfect how it is  Danny did a great job  It's perfect  What are you picking up?  He's trying to stick it back out  You can't stick your hair back out  I absolutely can  Afro Wars is over  You never said I can't continue the war  It's over  It's over  It's not over  I got hair  No you don't  I got hair  Look what he's doing  He's putting his hair back on his head  He's putting it on my head  I have a wonderful head of hair on my shoulders 
[03:09:30]  You guys tried to get Sam to lose Afro Wars by  You were in cahoots  You were like doing some top secret shit  You convinced Pez  You convinced  I don't know what you're talking about  You convinced him  I have my incestorses  I don't know what you're talking about  Because Pez wouldn't do a thing like that  A rambling crazy Irishman by the name of Mooch  Decided to take you  It was all fun and games  It was a nice security  Oh Sam 
[03:10:00]  There was Dave  There was Mooch  There was Pepper  I didn't even touch you  There was Pitsy  There was some random  Dave  Can you take the fake hair off your head  Before you put the headphones on?  Where's the glue?  Pitsy where's the glue Pitsy?  The glue  The shit ain't over  There's no glue  I need to ask you one question  I'm looking at a picture that E-Rock took  Where Kenny's pretty much choking you out  Your color  Is that from your alcoholism  Or because of the lack of air going to your head?  It's both buddy  Alright  Because you're a little blue there  Someone bring Dave some glue  He's asking for some glue 
[03:10:30]  Do you want glue really?  I really appreciate the help of Gras and Pits at this moment  Do you want glue to try to glue it back on?  Yeah  Because the effort  Look  I don't quit  You might think this is over  But it's not  Ron Fez  Noon to three  You can tape it to my head  You can do whatever you want  That means the after war continues  Dave you don't have to quit to be defeated  Here is what  How you would have beaten me  You got beat  I didn't get beat  There you go  You still have luscious hair in the back  People are saying you look like Clint Howard  I think  Hey  The guy was in Apollo 13

Well Dave  Because I have a back Afro  No you know  We took that out too  For the most part  Gabe Kapler had a back Afro 
[03:11:30]  Gabe Kapler  Dave's wife is stepping up  And saying where's the money  For the weight gain contest  I Opie owes me 500 clams  I don't know about  No weight gain contest  We're talking about Afro Wars  We're not talking about  Some weird weight gain contest  Yeah I don't remember that one  Oh boy  I don't remember the weight gain contest  We could get in trouble  For welshing on that one  Yeah  Yeah I don't remember  Actually doing that contest  I remember we were talking about  So let's admit then  If you are willing to admit  That Eastside Dave  Of Ron Fez Noon to 3  Defeated the entire staff  Of Opie and Anthony 
[03:12:00]  Six to Noon  In the biggest gainer  What about the plug  For the guys  That put you on TV  I just said  Six to Noon  You didn't mention the show  Comedy Central  I wasn't sure  What we could say  What we couldn't say  I was trying to protect you guys  You're smarter than  Dumb Sam  I think I know  What trade I want to make now  Hey Sam  Tell us what you did on the show  And then he gives the whole plot  Of the fucking TV show  That no one's supposed to know about  I just talked about kissing that guy  He's like  There's teams  And this and that  And points  Points  If you guys are willing to concede 
[03:12:30]  That I in fact won  The biggest gainer  They're now calling you  Eastside Larry Fine  Steven S. from Bayshore  Sorry  One third of the greatest  Comedy troupe of all time  Hey Mo  Can we give you the Clint Howard now?  If you concede that  I win the biggest gainer  This way it's a stalemate  Oh by the way  I got your wedding ring  So what are we going to do now?  Come on  Now you  Did that happen?

You want us to at least clean it up  A little bit for you  I want to admit that  I took the entire staff  Of you guys down  For biggest gainer  If you guys want to admit victory  Then it's a stalemate  And then more words can continue  But let's admit  That I took the biggest gainer competition

[03:18:00]  Once again  You started this like  Behind the scenes  I'm gonna try to  Like make him lose  Right  And we didn't forget  Yeah  And then  I remember being dragged  Into this competition  You took the honor  Out of the competition  Dragged into it  So  And you  And now to get serious  You were a star yesterday  Fucking Comedy Central  Thinks you're the real  Fucking deal  I did that for  Rob Fez  Noon to three  No you did it for  Opie and Anthony's TV show  You gotta like  Start separating yourself  My friend  Separate nothing 
[03:18:30]  But you were doing stuff  That they didn't even  Tell you to do  What did you do  You drank the  Give us the list  Of things you did  For the show  Yesterday  For the pilot  They cut off  Big A's eyebrows  And they were  Pulling them in a cup  With water  And I grabbed the cup  Out of the guy's hand  And drank it  And it had the eyebrows  The greasy  Big A eyebrows  Disgusting Big A  And I nearly threw up  There was grease in the cup  Even though it was just  Water and shaving cream  And eyebrows  And you drank that whole thing  That was horrifying  And then this one comedian 
[03:19:00]  Was eating apples  And spitting them  Into my mouth  You're doing like  A baby bird feeding  Yeah but it was  It would have been fun  Like two or three apples  But he did 15 fucking apples  On the street  And I started to throw up  And then I started almost  Throw up the apples  Back in his mouth  While he was doing it  So that was a horrifying thing  And then it ended with  A nipple piercing  I got a nipple pierce  Thank you  Yeah  Wow  I don't know exactly  How it's gonna come out  I'm like okay  Can I take it out now 
[03:19:30]  They're like no  Just keep it in there  For a while  Like it hurt  Yeah it hurt like hell  We wanted to get  His ball bag pierced  But they wouldn't do it  No  They wouldn't do it  Why wouldn't they  Not the champ  The champ was willing  To do it in a heartbeat  Why would they do it  It was downtown  And everything  Everything goes down there  The guy  They actually asked the guy  They're like  So will you pierce his balls  He's like  I pierced only one ball before  And the man had to go  To the hospital  I'm not gonna do that again  Yeah so we're like  Okay  I finally figured out  Something you will not do 
[03:20:00]  What's that  You've eaten your own shit  You've done it all  Yeah  You really have done it all  I'm gonna give you props now  But you will not get  A Prince Albert  I was  Absolutely  That's the only thing  You probably wouldn't do  God that's a piercing  Through the tip of your dick  Through the hole in your dick  Out through the bottom  Of your dick  And then you put  Like a barbell through it  Get a photo of a Prince Albert  I mean they  They're done  Yeah  I mean we won't even get  Who's this fucking Prince Albert  That is named after  That is named after him  And he's a fucking  Food in a can 
[03:20:30]  Yeah  He's a fucking  Hole through the cock  And bad food  Yeah I don't think  You'll do a Prince Albert  We're trying to find you one  And we won't get into  The dick slicing and all that  Cause then now  We're getting a little too  Too far  But as far as like  Relatively normal shit  I think that's the only thing  You wouldn't do  Well the penis is a sensitive area  For me  I've had problems with it before  Have you?  Although I was willing  To do a catheter on this program  Yeah that's true  What problems do you have? 
[03:21:00]  What?  Um  Certain issues  Fever blisters  Is what I call them  You have fever blisters  On your penis  You fucking started talking  About this yesterday  In between like  That's an old problem  In between  Oh really?  Stuff we were filming  I have a little Valtrex  Can't cure  Oh  No  It was honestly  I swear to god  I have very sensitive skin  And I get into  Um  I break out with the hives a lot  Yeah  And I swear to god  Cause the doctor said  That it's not herpetic 
[03:21:30]  And I wouldn't have ever used  Remember that word  Had he not told that to me  Right  But um  But um  Some are debating that  Yeah the guy  The guy tested for everything  And did he give you Valtrex?  Why the Valtrex then?  Why Valtrex?  Because he said  It would cure  It would be the same symptoms  It would alleviate  So it's just like herpes  Except it's not herpes  It isn't though  Cause I get like  The hives on the side  Of my body  And like my forehead  Right  But have you been tested  Blood tested for herpes?  Yes  Do you have any herpes  Anti-bodies? 
[03:22:00]  No  No I don't  Okay  East side  There's your Prince Albert  That's the only thing  I could think of  That you wouldn't do  That looks like  It could do some permanent damage  That's part of  That's like part of the  Normal world  I mean we could go further  With this stuff  But as far as like  Things you would  Do and not do  That's the only thing  I could think of  Right there  Who would want that?  I don't know  It looks like it would be fun  That's the only thing  And I'm not even trying  To convince you  I gotta think about it  That's all  Yeah right 
[03:22:30]  Oh boy  That looks so painful  If you're gonna do it  Wait for this TV show  To be picked up  We could do five  Seven minutes on this one  Yeah please  You lost Afro Wars  How does it feel?  I don't feel like I did  You can't continue  I don't feel like I did  But Dave  I understand  You lost Dave  I understand  You're spunk or whatever  But it's over  You can't continue now  I mean how did I lose?  I was grabbed  By a multitude of 
[03:23:00]  Security men  Did you come in here  On your own?  You weren't smart enough  See you gotta like  Get that brain smart too  Right  I'm not the most intelligent  Key in the box  All you do is stay out  Of the studio  And we wouldn't have got you  You walked into your own trap  Right  I don't know what that meant  But  What about the biggest gainer  Yeah right  I won that competition  It was supposed to be over by now  Pat Duffy would do a Prince Albert  By the way  You know the guy that's been  Eating in the stunts 
[03:23:30]  He would  I don't know though  But eating his own shit  My own feces  My own feces  Is better than  Rushing  That was crazy  The guy went to the hospital  Having hot sauce  Put up his ass  From a  Semi-celebrity  He's got fucking  Kidding Jay  Come on  He's got herpes  Fever blisters  He's got herpes  Fever blisters  Fucking Tabasco up the assholes  Nothing in this  Genital hives  Genital hives  Genital hives  Oh my god  Let's see  Did you show the pal talkers  Maybe they
