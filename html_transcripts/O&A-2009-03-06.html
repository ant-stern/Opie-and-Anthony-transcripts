<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a comedic bit imagining a zombie apocalypse, speculating that the homeless would surprisingly fare better than the wealthy.  This segued into a far less hypothetical, and significantly more disastrous, real-life investment story involving the hosts.  Opie and Anthony, joined by Rich Voss (filling in for Jim Norton), recounted their catastrophic investment in the Citadel Broadcasting IPO.  They each invested $100,000, watching their initial investment briefly rise to around $22 per share before collapsing to a single penny.  This meant their combined $200,000 investment was reduced to approximately $55.  The hosts' reactions were laced with profanity and exaggerated expressions of disbelief and anger at their loss, focusing their ire on Citadel's management, Fareed and Judy.  They also revealed that this investment debacle coincided with their subsequent firing from their radio jobs. The segment featured numerous humorous interjections and listener calls, including a particularly cruel prank call where a listener was initially overjoyed at winning $100,000 only to be informed the prize was now worth a measly $55 due to the plummeting Citadel stock. The segment ended with continued comedic reactions and listener interaction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Yards.  Yeah.  Just watch one good zombie movie.  Eventually they'll get you two.  Well, I don't know.  Oh, you'll get the first couple thousand.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But then there'll be a couple more thousand after that.  And after that.  And after that.  Zombies, very rambunctious.  Right.  And eventually you got to sleep.  And now they're starting to pry open the, you know, the windows of your estate. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think.  Even I Am Legend, you know, he took all those precautions.  That's what I'm saying.  I was basically going with that movie, I Am Legend.  See, I live.  Like, I Am Legend, only white.  I live way up in the sky.  So I'm saying I have a better shot than you, my friend.  There's zombies in your building.  Yeah, they're going to climb 40, 45 effing stories.  No, they're going to say hi to the zombie doorman that identified him every day. 
[00:01:00]  And then just go up to their zombie apartments, which are right next to yours.  Yeah.  Come through the wall.  You think?  Yeah.  Everyone's going to be a zombie.  Especially people that live in well-to-do neighborhoods.  Because they're the ones that are going to, they got the most to lose.  The people that are going to have the upper hand right now are the homeless.  Yeah.  Because they're used to all this crap.  It's all the people of wealth and even upper middle class that are just going to be left  out going, I don't know what to do. 
[00:01:30]  I don't have money left.  The bank, I went to the bank.  I went to, I filled out a little withdrawal slip.  I was going to put it in a vault that I bought, a little safe.  And I went to the bank and the door was locked.  And there was a note there that said, no money.  And then you go there and there's other people that show up.  And then you start clawing at each other's faces to be first online.  Oof.  Yeah.  And when the bank, if the bank ever did open again, there's limited funds. 
[00:02:00]  So if you're first, you might get some money at the end of the line.  What, are you going to stand at the end of the line and go, oh, I'm going to stand here  for no money?  No, you're going to take out the guy at the front of the line.  It would just be anarchy.  You think the homeless people are worried like we are?  No, they're laughing at us right now.  But do you think they have any type of worries in their head?  Because they got nothing.  But you think this affects them somehow?  I won't get a cake.  I earned that cake.  I went to the cake bank.  Could we at least start a new radio station? 
[00:02:30]  Caveman Radio.  It's going to be.  We're all going to be thrust back into the Stone Age.  Even Rich Voss is contemplating getting a shotgun.  Rich Voss here this morning in for the vacationing Jim Norton.  Actually, he's working in Frisco.  He never vacations.  The homeless are going to worry because one of the first things people cut back on during  a depression is soda, cans, and soda.  And that's their currency.  And that's their living.  Yeah.  So they're going to be crazy scrambling when there's only one or two cans in a garbage can. 
[00:03:00]  So the homeless will be affected, too.  Everybody will be affected.  Yeah.  Dude, how about that?  I know, and I'm not talking about bum fights.  I know that's been done.  But almost like cock fights that they do.  But we get a couple of homeless guys and throw some cans in the middle and have them collect  them up.  And they've got to just kind of peck at each other to get the cans.  We could do the same thing with two radio execs.  Well, that's true, too. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, they could fight over the cans.  Boss, you might want to sit back for about five minutes because I'm sinking into something.  Oh, brother.  And certainly we'll be back to you in a minute.  But we have to bitch and complain for about five minutes.  And before we get panicky Pete's down the hall, we're not talking about this company.  Oh, no, no.  We want to talk about a little radio company called Citadel Broadcasting. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  Citadel Broadcasting.  Shouldn't we save this break for like 7.30 when everybody's listening?  I think we should just continuously weave it through the program today for the entire  day because it's such a special day.  Right.  This is officially the last day you'll be able to trade Citadel stock on the big boys board.  Yes.  Let's go back in time when radio was very, very healthy. 
[00:04:30]  Yes.  And your boys, Opie and Anthony, were doing very, very well.  Yes.  Starting to do well financially, starting to do well professionally.  Uh-huh.  Our personal lives, well, they were in shambles, but that's okay.  That's never mattered.  Right.  That was always the least of our worries.  Right.  You're right.  I mean, you could always dump a bitch.  Right.  I lived with a crazy broad for so long.  I'm like, ah, I'll get to that situation someday. 
[00:05:00]  And, uh, I remember, I remember vacationing on Cape Cod when the word came down, do you  want to be in on an IPO?  Why don't you explain what an IPO is?  Remember the good old days when someone would come up to you?  And not many people were fortunate enough to be in on the little insider club there.  Opie, let me tell the people.  Well, only the movers and shakers got in on the IPOs. 
[00:05:30]  Uh, that is known as an initial public offering.  Right.  And what it is, is, uh, your chance to buy the stock of a brand new company that's just,  uh, becoming public.  Uh-huh.  Uh, at whatever rate, whatever price they, they deem will be their opening price.  Right.  And then from there, the sky's the limit.  Usually the stock shoots up from that point and you are just rolling. 
[00:06:00]  I mean, literally rolling in the dough.  Let me, uh, use an example.  Um, let me just pick one out of my, uh, you know, that area.  Yeah.  Uh, Google.  Google.  Google was outrageous for their IPO because I believe it was, uh, teetering around.  It was around $100 a share, which is crazy for an initial public offering.  And who has that type of money?  Who has that kind of cake?  But it's an IPO.  So you start, like, uh, calling in favors and selling everything you got. 
[00:06:30]  You get in on the Google.  You get in on that Google.  And, uh, it, it immediately shot up, I believe, to almost $200 a share.  It was one of those stocks where you were like, oh my God, I got in on this.  Right.  And this is, like, how you make your fortunes.  Right.  Uh, yeah.  So when the word came down that we could get it in on the Citadel IPO, we're like, oh my  God.  Oh my God.  Ground floor.  What did we do in our lives to deserve this? 
[00:07:00]  How much and where do I send the check?  Right.  That's how we were.  And eager little beavers.  And I think at that time, uh, it was almost a guarantee every IPO would go through the  roof.  Almost a guarantee.  We're like, wow, look at us, and we are like, our lives are rocking.  Now we're being invited to being on IPOs.  We, it's, it's, it's a, it's a business we understand radio.  How could we lose?  We got, uh, we got some liquid assets.  Right.  And, uh, we're, we're able to, uh, you know, scrape up some cash and, and, and throw it 
[00:07:30]  into this.  I remember vacationing on Cape Cod.  The, the, the word came down.  There were phone calls as I'm kind of like just sunning and walking the beaches.  I got my cell phone and I'm wheeling and dealing with the, with the big wigs back in  New York to get in on the IPO.  Oh, I have to fax a few things.  It was crazy.  But I'm like, I am in.  And then I called it like you got in, right?  I'm like, I sure did.  I sure did.  I'm in.  And I was the kind of guy, I was the kind of guy that like, uh, as far as 
[00:08:00]  trading stock goes this way, Rich, you might have a heart attack at the end of this, at  the end of this segment.  As far as stock goes, I was always the in out kind of guy, buy some stock out, things  like that.  This was really going to be kind of a long for me.  You know, I was going to hang in with this one, uh, for a while.  Uh, so I figured I'm not just going to buy a little bit of this.  Let's really invest like a man. 
[00:08:30]  Oh yeah.  Let's invest some real money.  Oh, none of this fooling around crap.  No, none of this.  Ah, we'll throw a couple thousand at it and see what happens.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I was basically, how much do I have in the bank right now?  Let me just write that check.  I'll transfer funds, whatever I need to do.  And, uh, and I think we, we went in exactly the same amount, the same shares.  We said, how many shares can I get for $100,000? 
[00:09:00]  No way.  So me and Opie, each, each, each took $100,000.  So Mortimer and Randolph.  Right.  Exactly.  And purchased, each of us purchased 5,500 shares of Citadel.  Of Citadel Broadcasting. 
[00:09:30]  $100,000.  $100,000.  I never wrote a check for anything larger in my life.  Which at $19 a share equaled out to about $100,000.  Yes.  For 5,500 shares.  It was a little more than 100 Gs.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever it was.  Oh, just a little more.  That didn't make you nervous.  It's an IPO!  Yo, what's wrong with you, Rich Voss?  It's a sure thing, Rich.  See how stupid you are.  We're getting in on the ground floor.  Holy. 
[00:10:00]  The ground floor.  Not only was I not nervous, I was feeling really good.  I was starting to look at vacation homes and all sorts of stuff.  I was seeing a retirement like you see in the movies.  Right.  Feeling good, Opie.  Looking good, Opie.  I'm on the beach.  You're on the yacht.  Da-da-da.  Yeah, that's, you know.  And then, in all fairness, after we got in, initially, for 100 Gs each, the stock was at 
[00:10:30]  $19 a share.  $19.  I do believe, like IPOs do, it did go up.  It didn't go up like a Google.  But it went up to...  What was the official high of Citadel?  $22 a share.  So, I remember Ed and I going, all right, well, we just are...  Here it goes.  It's now up $3 a share.  We got, what, 5,500 shares.  So, we're talking about a $15,000 profit already.  We're thinking...  Something like that, right?  $16,500.  Well, I wasn't thinking...  $16,500, you're right. 
[00:11:00]  And I wasn't thinking, get out.  I'm thinking, here it goes.  I'm like, this is a good start.  We're on the road, because this...  Up, up, up.  Up, up, up.  Here it goes, Alice.  Up, up, up.  Yeah, it's going up.  Well, shortly after the high of $22 a share, it certainly went back down below $19 a share.  It dipped back, but you know something?  So, now we're officially losing money on this.  In the hole a bit.  A little bit.  How long did it take for it to drop?  Not too long. 
[00:11:30]  I'd have to look at the chart, but not too long, my friend.  It stayed at $22 for, I think, 10 minutes.  You had a 10-minute window of opportunity to punch out.  And there were signs that radio was changing, but we're like, ah, radio, we'll figure it out.  And in turn, Citadel will go back up to where it should be, because other radio companies were in the 40s, Rich.  So, we're thinking $19 a share.  If it goes up into the 40s like these other companies, oh, my God.  We're making well over $100,000 in profit. 
[00:12:00]  A little man named Fareed was running the company, who was like one of the financial whizzes at Infinity Broadcasting.  When Mel Carmson was running this joint.  It was called the bean counter, so I figured, hey, this guy knows money.  All right.  We're in good hands.  Yeah.  And we knew he had a private jet.  Oh, yeah.  And he wanted to syndicate us, and he did syndicate us.  Oh, it was everything was coming together.  Well, it steadily just kept declining down through 18. 
[00:12:30]  I believe we started voicing a concern to each other when it broke through the $17 barrier into the 16 and change.  And then we're thinking, is this coming back?  Should we punch out now, take the loss, blah, blah, blah?  Well, let me tell you, the faith and confidence we had in the genius management skills of Fareed and Judy over there at Citadel, 
[00:13:00]  we could not be shaken.  We knew this was coming back.  Even as it fell through 16, 15, 14, and 13, we knew.  We sure did.  That it was coming back at some point.  And then it dropped to 16.  Well.  And then 15.  14.  13.  And all I kept thinking is, we're going to bottom at 10, because there's no way it's gone into the single-digit things. 
[00:13:30]  This is going to, it's definitely going to come back.  And then it got to a point, Rich, where out of principle, I was never going to sell this thing.  People were like, you just got to take the loss and see if you can write it off against some gains.  They can have that year and stuff.  And I'm like, no.  I am holding this because I don't want to be the guy regretting going, you know what?  I sold that at 13 a share.  Right.  And now what is it?  Could you check what?  Yeah.  53?  Yeah.  It's at 53 and I sold it.  Well, ding, ding, there's the $10 market just punched through into the nines. 
[00:14:00]  Rich, I would dream for a $10 share stock at this point.  Look at Rich's eyes like, oh, my God.  I would be popping Dom Perignon and lighting cigars with $100 bills if I could off that stock at $10 a share.  It would be a victory as it fell through 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[00:14:30]  Now, once you fall below the dollar mark, NASDAQ and Wall Street and the Dow starts going,  look, you got to do something because we don't trade penny stocks.  So if you don't get your stock price above a dollar, we delist you from the NASDAQ or the Dow Jones.  They then take you and put you in this thing called the pink sheets. 
[00:15:00]  Because it's like if you go to Times Square and it's like the lights, there's tourists, there's movie theaters,  there's TGI Fridays, whatever you need, it's right there.  And then you turn down one of those side streets.  Those are the pink sheets as compared to, like, the real Wall Street trades.  This is off, off Wall Street.  Yes.  This is off, off Wall Street.  You know how they like to talk about off-Broadway?  This is off, off Wall Street.  Well, at what point do you start blaming the Jews? 
[00:15:30]  At what dollar?  No, actually, Fareed and Judy were being blamed.  Yeah.  And during this time, they had the wisdom, the foresight, the smarts to just yank us from every station that they had us on.  Right.  Even though we were doing very well.  We were doing very well, and they were not paying us a lot of money.  No, no.  And we even decided, all right, we'll take another drastic pay cut. 
[00:16:00]  Just to stay in the market.  And then they officially came to us and said, we can't even pay that anymore.  Well, so the fact that you already put $100,000 in.  Yeah.  So the fact that you lose in everything.  Yeah.  Your reward is to get taken off.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  To try to get your money back.  Yeah.  That's your reward.  Yeah, taken off of the station.  You know what?  You guys invested in us.  We lost your money.  Yeah.  Here's how we're going to pay you.  You're fired.  Take it easy.  Right.  Take a hike.  So we're at about $1, right?  Well, a year ago, it was $1.86. 
[00:16:30]  $1.86 one year ago today.  Right.  That was the year's high.  Six months ago, it was $0.90 a share, Rich Voss.  Remember, we put in $100,000 each.  Yes.  We did $19 a share.  Three months ago, it was $0.24 a share, Rich Voss.  Yes, three months ago.  One month ago, it was $0.19 a share.  I don't know about my career or the stocks.  Yeah.  $0.19 a share.  So that's a penny on every dollar for the share so far. 
[00:17:00]  A week ago, it was $0.14 a share, Rich Voss.  A week ago.  Oh, I wish it was still $0.14.  Oh, my God.  To get out at $0.14, I would feel like the guy on the Monopoly card when you take a community  chest.  Remember, this story started 20 minutes ago at $19 a share.  Yes.  Now we're at $0.14 a share.  $0.14.  I cannot wait until you guys are living on the street and I'm going to hand you a bundle 
[00:17:30]  of money and you guys go, we're back in the game.  Yeah.  Well, yesterday, Citadel officially closed.  Are you ready for this, Rich Voss?  $0.19.  At a penny a share.  $0.01 a...  It's awesome for Christ's sake, Rich Voss!  $0.15.  Mortimer!  So, if you want to, like, point and laugh at Opie and Anthony today, to summarize this 
[00:18:00]  20-minute break, our $100,000 investment that we did a mere four, I think, four or five  years ago is now worth...  Do we have a drumroll?  Our $100,000 investment.  $100,000 each.  Each.  We each put in $100,000, so that's $200,000 that was invested in there.  Right.  But $100,000 investment that we made...  Yeah.  We have a drumroll?  At the IPO.  Right.  Ground floor... 
[00:18:30]  Right.  ...is now worth...  $55.  How can the price be going down?  Something's wrong.  Where's Wilson?  We're taking protection!  Boom!  $55.  We just turned $100,000 into $55.  $10,000. 
[00:19:00]  $10,000 of what we invested makes a million.  Right.  I can't even buy a pair of new jeans with my initial investment.  $100,000.  Makes $550.  $10,000 of what we had makes a million.  Right.  $10,000 of what we have now makes $550.  Your investment can get you a half a pair of sneakers.  Yes!  $100,000 would have been a nice vacation home somewhere. 
[00:19:30]  Now we can barely afford...  You can get a cheap pair of jeans for $55.  I can't buy a full box of ammo for my Desert Eagle with what my stock is worth now.  But what...  See, I don't do stocks, but what I keep hearing, especially what liberals are saying, is wait  it out and it'll come back.  Yeah!  That's what they're saying.  I'll wait that one out.  That stock certificate, by the way.  I have the actual certificate.  I don't even know where mine is.  It is going in a frame.  Yeah.  It is hanging on my wall in my office to stare at as a reminder of the giant cluster F that 
[00:20:00]  any involvement we've ever had with Citadel Broadcasting has brought us.  Farid and Judy, they weren't quoted, but a journalist said in the paper yesterday, I was reading  an article on how the stock is a penny, and they were talking about how the old management  team at Citadel, before they took over, had shows that were conservative talker, WABC. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, that station bills.  And then, in their infinite wisdom, Farid and Judy decided to put on shows on there that  were off-topic for conservative talkers, and just...  They said that the incompetent management brought Citadel to the point it's at now, and that  is Farid and Judy. 
[00:21:00]  Thank you, guys.  Two people that can go down in history as taking a stock that was at $19 a share at the  IPO, went up to $22, and then sunk down to where it's now being thrown out to the pink  sheets at one penny a share, taking everybody's $100,000 investment and magically turning it  into $55 and having not a clue where any of that money went.  This is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to give you $60 each and buy you both out. 
[00:21:30]  I want it.  You're going to make $5 each today.  The certificate, to me, is well worth...  Okay.  I've never had $100,000 certificate.  I have a piece of paper that I bought for $100,000.  Yeah.  A piece of paper.  I have a square 8x10 piece of paper.  I could have bought a work of art that I could have hung on my wall.  That would have been envied. 
[00:22:00]  I'm a fan of some of Picasso's stuff.  You probably could have gotten a Picasso.  Not when he got weird where he put the eyeball on the cheek and stuff.  He did stuff before that.  Oh, my God.  I think I might have been able to get something nice.  You could have gotten...  I would love to see maybe somebody can go on a site, maybe here or online, PalTalk.  I know a lot of people there.  Yeah.  They can maybe go online and see what type of famous art, something we'd all know, that 
[00:22:30]  we could have bought for $100,000 that I could have hung on my wall instead of a stock certificate  that will do nothing but remind me.  So, once again, our $100,000 investment is officially worth $55 today.  $55.  Thank you, Fareed and Judy, for that great investment, the great company, and the great 
[00:23:00]  see you later once they booted us out the door.  Yeah.  Once they ran out of cash.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Wow.  Good job.  I would be out of my mind.  Yes.  Whoa!  Oh, no!  Whoa!  Whoa!  We're giving the David reaction.  Oh, no!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh, hey!  Whoa!  And that's how we start today.  Yeah.  Wow.  John says it. 
[00:23:30]  I, I, I, you know, what are you going to do?  Let's go to...  John, what are you going to do?  John will talk for all listeners today.  John, I'm Long Island.  How are you, John?  I don't know.  You know, you have to, you have to.  You have to just laugh.  This is, this is, this is why our show is, is quite different than every other radio show  out there.  No one's going to show you the underbelly of, of our souls. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  No one does that.  Every other radio guy is like, I look how great I am.  Yeah.  Not us.  We, we do, we do a little of that, look how great we are.  Huh?  But we also do the other side.  Look at what idiots we were when we went into this IPO.  No.  Oh.  It's worth $55, Rich.  For real.  I'm not even joking.  No, no.  The good thing is...  Being Jewish, you got to be having like an aneurysm or something right now.  The good thing is it didn't happen.  Look at Rich, he's all itchy and it's not even him. 
[00:24:30]  I know.  He's just like imagining what this would do to him.  Well, but at least it took a while and it didn't ruin your vacation in Cape Cod.  At least...  Oh, dude.  I was, I was kind of, I remember being mad after I did this deal.  I'm like, why didn't I, why, I have a little more.  Oh, my God.  Why did I not go more in?  That's how I'm justifying it.  And then you can look at it like you're a winner.  And then when it went down to like $10 and eight and all that, I'm like, oh, my God,  this is a great...  Great buying opportunity.  And I was ready to go all in again. 
[00:25:00]  The one time...  So I guess it could have been worse.  Oh.  The one time I bought stock, I bought a mutual fund.  I put $5,000 in.  A mutual fund?  I don't know.  I think...  All I know is I'm watching it every night because I'm a gambler.  Yeah, but it's a mutual fund.  It's not going to really spike it.  Well, it started dropping.  It went from $80, then it was dropping, and I got out and made $300.  It went from $80 to like $4.  I would have lost my five.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And five to me is like $200,000 to you.  Hey.  You know, person how... 
[00:25:30]  Let me go to John in Denver.  John is doing a little math here.  John?  Opie and Anthony, if you'd have taken that $100,000, invested it in beer, not the company,  but cans of beer, you could have drank the beer and sold the aluminum today for $147.  We would have made more on the aluminum at a scrapyard.  Wow.  That's some perspective. 
[00:26:00]  You know what?  Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin.  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Yes.  Hey, guys, guess what?  You just won $100,000.  Yeah.  Yeah, you just won $100,000.  Boy, is that justice.  You know what?  This is...  You got a candy bar, man.  This is...  No, no.  I'm sorry.  You got $55.  What?  $55, right?  Hey, can you guys...  I was going to buy a new truck.  All right.  We'll play that for you, Kevin.  I know where you're going.  It's $100,000. 
[00:26:30]  How many candy bars can we now buy?  Candy bars are still under a buck, right?  $55, probably, like, maybe $100,000 candy bars.  Sometimes they go on sale two for one, I guess.  Yeah, there you go.  I guess.  All right.  So we would get around $100,000 for $100,000.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine someone went to you and go, all right, you see this $100,000?  I want you to go to your local convenience store.  Yeah.  7-Eleven, what have you.  Quick check.  Ah?  Ah?  Ah?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And I want you to buy $100,000 candy bars for that. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  People would go, we would go, you're crazy.  What are you talking about?  What are they, Wonka bars?  Is there a magic ticket inside?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  No, really.  Trust me on this one.  This is what your $100,000 is going to be worth someday.  So you might as well go and just buy the $100,000 candy bars now.  Yeah.  What?  Well.  Can we play the $100,000 as we go to break?  The phones are lit.  People are doing math.  I have a quick switch.  We'll go to the phones after the break.  I love the perspective thing.  Yeah.  I love when people can put it in these certain perspectives that, yeah, 
[00:27:30]  that's really good.  Perhaps we could find out if you laid a dollar end to end,  how far 100,000 of them go.  Yeah.  As opposed to 55 of them.  Okay.  And see how far we could have gone.  You know, when they go, oh, you could take and stack the money up,  and it goes to the moon and back.  Yeah.  Let's see how $100,000 laid end to end, how far that is, and how far 55 is.  Right.  You could take those certificates and put them on eBay at least. 
[00:28:00]  I could probably do that and sell it for more than 55 bucks.  I think if I sign mine, I could maybe get $20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no, you can make more than 55 bucks.  Yes.  I would start the bidding at $102,000.  Yeah.  Yeah.  $102,000.  I'll get to that.  Start the bidding.  We once gave away $100,000, and this is the end of that fine contest we did many years ago.  And I believe we've got a break here.  What?  I believe that's why this happened to us.  This is karma. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  No kidding.  Mel.  Yeah.  Jim Jeffries joins the program next, but first this.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Get out of the way!  Tell me, I won!  I won!  I don't know why!  You're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man. 
[00:29:00]  The first thing, I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jesus.  I've got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand, huh?  I got this...  Oh, man.  I got this s*** box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new...  Oh, that...  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?
