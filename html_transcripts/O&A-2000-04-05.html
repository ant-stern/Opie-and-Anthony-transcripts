<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about the aftermath of a physical altercation between comedian Jay Moore and a large audience member, nicknamed "Fat Guy," outside their studio.  Video footage of the fight had circulated online, sparking considerable listener reaction, some praising it as "the best damn radio I've ever heard."  Jay Moore himself called in, detailing his version of events, expressing frustration over his stolen hat, and describing how the incident became a running gag in his subsequent comedy show.  The conversation was punctuated by frequent use of homophobic slurs and other offensive language.  Another caller claimed to possess additional video footage and Moore's Milwaukee Bucks cap.  The hosts also revealed their stressful financial situation, detailing a tense phone call with their accountant about a $19,000 debt and expressing their frustration with the syndication process, which they described as "psychological torture."

The show then transitioned into their "Most Offensive Song Contest."  The hosts promoted upcoming appearances by comedian Stephen Lynch and a planned party, while continuing to discuss the Jay Moore altercation, including accusations of drug use and other inappropriate behavior against Moore.  Buddy Hacky was mentioned as being present at Opie's house.  The contest itself featured a barrage of listener-submitted songs with extremely offensive lyrics targeting racism, homophobia, and pedophilia.  Songs like "I'm Horny for Little Girls" were played repeatedly, alongside a John Lennon parody that was interrupted by a commercial.  Anthony's brother, Joe, even submitted his own entry.  Callers reacted with a wide spectrum of responses, ranging from uproarious laughter to deep disgust.  The hosts also promoted Paisano's Italian restaurant and Rockaway Bedding.

The contest continued, with callers expressing varying degrees of shock and amusement, and one even claiming to have vomited.  One caller, James, criticized the lack of originality in the songs, while another threatened to deny paternity if he was the subject of one.  A call from Kevin at Fox News requested audio/video of the Jay Moore studio brawl, highlighting Fox News' comparatively relaxed broadcasting standards.  The hosts mentioned a potentially un-airable topic that had caused them concern.  The contest reached a climax with the submission of "Mein Fuhrer," a highly offensive song about the Holocaust, prompting intense outrage from listeners, particularly those of Jewish heritage.  Callers like David (whose grandparents were Holocaust victims) and Andrew (identifying as both Jewish and Cuban) expressed their deep offense. The intense negative reaction forced the hosts to end the contest prematurely.

Following the controversy, the show briefly shifted to a prank call made to a drunk "Psycho Mark" at Shea Stadium on opening day, incorporating listener accounts of opening day shenanigans, and a discussion about Mariah Carey's illness and its graphic implications.  The remainder of the segment consisted of continued fallout from the "most offensive song" contest, along with more listener reactions.

The final segment focused on a frantic search for a missing commercial ("PIX spot") that a producer, "Spaz" (Mark), had failed to air.  Spaz, heavily intoxicated after a Mets game, faced repeated berating from Opie and Anthony for his negligence.  The segment was filled with profanity and escalating tension as the hosts investigated the missing commercial, involving speculation about other staff members' roles, including "Earl" and their boss, "Jeremy."  Checking production logs (code 109 was mentioned) became part of the search.  The hosts played audio clips of Spaz's severely slurred speech from a public service announcement and a community calendar segment, described as "torture" to listen to.  Numerous calls from people who were with Spaz at the Mets game corroborated his intoxicated state.  Spaz also provided various drunk impressions during the segment.  The segment further interwove listener calls from the "most offensive song" contest, showcasing more bizarre and offensive entries, and concluded with a clip of Casey Kasem's frustrated rant about difficult transitions, juxtaposed with Spaz's drunken performance. Cowbell Bill was also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhumans show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's fight!  Yeah!  It's the most talked about radio show in New York City, baby.  Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  Why is everyone listening to our radio show, Anthony?  No way, nothing to see here. Move on.  Why is everyone tuned in once again to the Opie and Anthony show?  Why, why, why, why?  Move along.  Move along, nothing to see here today.  Move along.  Move along.  That's it.  You're going to have to disperse.  Change your radio dials. 
[00:01:00]  Stop being paranoid.  Nothing's going on here today.  Move along, people. Move along.  You're going to have to disperse.  Please move.  Stay behind the barriers.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing to see.  This was the song they were playing when they had a big radio show up in the air yesterday afternoon, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think we need to crank this up today, and we'll get the festivities going in just a bit.  This is the Opie and Anthony show on 1027 WNEW. 
[00:01:30]  Crank this bad boy up.  Opie and Anthony.  I find that.  This is debauchery mania.  I find that.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I find that.  1027 WNEW.  Are we having fun yet?  I think so.  I have to check.  Yeah.  Are we allowed to have fun?  Uh, no.  We're not.  Syndication never. 
[00:02:00]  What happened?  Okay, horrific.  I don't understand.  What?  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  Yeah.  What happened?  We are.  We were doing a radio show.  People were enjoying it, right?  Making people laugh.  Making people forget about their horrible, miserable days.  Right.  That's all we do.  That's our job.  Right?  Yeah.  What happened, though?  What happened to the fun?  Aren't we in radio to have fun, Anthony? 
[00:02:30]  That's what I thought.  Oh, well.  I'm going to have fun.  Syndication never.  All right, Ant.  Well, well, well.  Where do we start today?  Where the hell do we start today?  Yeah, that's a tough question.  We have so much stuff to go over.  We have so many things to get to.  We have three entries into the Most Defensive Song Contest.  Yeah, the competition heating up, Alfie.  We've got some real contenders that have come in. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, we're going to definitely play three brand new ones today.  Yeah.  And I guess that's all we're going to do.  That's it.  I guess right off the bat, we've got to find out how Jay Moore's show was last night at Rascals.  At Rascals, yeah.  After leaving here in a tizzy.  And it all wound up in a huge tizzy.  He did a show at Rascals.  Mm-hmm.  I know when I saw him down at Rascals, he was hysterical.  Just wondering if anybody saw the show last night. 
[00:03:30]  Well, I got a few emails.  And like always, he killed last night.  Yes.  Very good.  There wasn't any bloodshed?  Any brawling down there?  No.  That would have been an interesting...  There are some unbelievable clips from the mess that was the Opie and Anthony show yesterday.  Well, we went back to the office and watched the video of Fat Guy and Jay Moore just...  Going at it.  There's some great clips on the unofficial website. 
[00:04:00]  Unbelievable.  I'm sure they'll be removed soon, so you better hurry up and check it out for yourself.  Well, let's go to the phones, Anthony.  They finally got them working.  We've been stalling here because they had to reboot the system.  Yeah.  But it looks like they're up and running, so let's say hi to Keith.  Hi, Keith.  What's going on?  Hey.  How are you?  All right.  Just wanted to make a comment about yesterday's show.  It was the best damn radio I've ever heard.  That was someday.  Unbelievable.  It was a lot of fun to be a part of.  That guy got his balls beaten off.  Hmm. 
[00:04:30]  Well, I just don't understand what was going on yesterday.  I don't know what the motivation was.  I don't know what the motivation was.  Well, he got up at Jay.  Jay did the right thing.  He went after him.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Jay rules.  You guys rock.  Take care.  Thank you.  Our accountant's on the line.  Are we allowed to put him on the air?  Let's see.  Oh, man.  You got me on the air?  Hey, you're on the air.  Don't say anything stupid.  Would I say anything stupid?  Yes.  Right.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the reason why I owe $19,000.  No, no. 
[00:05:00]  The gentleman wants $19,000.  What?  They want $19,000.  Oh, they want.  They're going to say you owe $19,000.  Oh, I like that.  After I get through with you, you're going to owe everything.  He sounds like the guy at the NASDAQ board.  Thank you.  Always the upside.  Always talking the upside to the whole thing.  Anthony.  Yeah.  You owe me some information.  Yes, I know.  What am I waiting for?  I got...  Don't you worry.  I'll be...  Uh-oh, what?  Your stuff is finished.  Your stuff is finished, all right.  Your stuff in $19,000 is finished.  Oh, the $19,000... 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that...  Okay.  Well...  It's all done.  Let's just put it this way.  I owe $19,000 from some past information.  Right.  What do I owe total if you add in this year's information?  You owe nothing from this information.  I'm going to owe you when I get through with them.  Oh, awesome.  You love me now?  What?  What's wrong?  Hold it, hold it.  Rick is freaking out.  See, I wasn't here last week when this whole accountant thing went down.  You have no idea I owed $19,000?  I heard it on a tape earlier that you owed $19,000. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't realize it was for past.  I thought it was just from the past year.  No, that's why I'm scared.  Dude, break up with my sister.  You ain't got no money left.  So, Benny, are we looking good?  Looking very good.  Wait, who's going to pick it up?  Sending in Sandy again?  You got enough nerve?  Yeah, you hit on her last.  No, she hit on me.  She came in twice also.  I wouldn't be surprised.  No, no, she wouldn't do it.  You owe me a visit, Opie.  At least you got money.  Yeah, that's why she hit on him. 
[00:06:30]  You owe me a visit, Opie.  No, because then you're going to hit on me.  No, that's what you wanted last year.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony came in because he liked it, too.  Yeah.  Anthony, get me that information.  I will.  I'll call you right after the show.  I'll be here until, wait, I'll be here tonight.  So, that 19 grand looking a little better these days, huh?  Yes.  No, we take care of it.  This is what they say.  They don't say what I say.  Oh, that's it.  I mean, they don't listen to me.  Oh, that's what you need is a cocky accountant.  Yeah, one that can shove a decimal point over a couple of places. 
[00:07:00]  If it doesn't come out right, we don't file it.  We do it over.  You do it over.  Make sure it all makes sense, right?  Well, did you save all the money you got back last year?  Uh, uh, I told you to.  I went into some high-risk tech stocks that are pretty gone over the past couple of weeks.  Keep on investing in the market.  You're good.  Yeah, we'll keep losing money.  It'll be a deduction for next year.  You got that right.  Benny, you see how I dress.  You think I saved any money from last year?  I know the way you dress.  Okay.  You're all the holes in your clothes. 
[00:07:30]  I see all that.  All right, Benny.  All right, I'm going to work.  All right, Ben.  I'll call you after the show.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  There it is, Ben.  Hey, look at that.  I love him.  Look at that.  He's great.  He's looking a little better for the Ops.  He is our ticket to the penitentiary.  Let's move that decimal point over and everything will be okay.  That's all.  While you're writing the number down, you sneeze, the pen moves, you go,  oops, you all.  Look at where that decimal ended up.  Now it's 19 bucks. 
[00:08:00]  It's funny because after Benny does our taxes every year, he disappears to the tropics for a while.  Yeah, what's up with that?  I don't know.  Hey, where are you going?  Some small tropical island.  Island.  Why are you leaving us, Benny?  Hey, where are you going?  We've got a relationship here.  Right.  This is okay, right?  I can just mail it in.  No problems, right?  I won't get a bill for 19 grand, will I?  Oh, no.  All right, let's go back to the phones. 
[00:08:30]  What is so funny, Rick?  You're laughing because of my misery, right?  I'm dumbfounded how you could have something like leftover from God knows what year that added up to 19 grand.  Not for God knows what year.  It was last year.  It was last year.  It happens.  It happens, right?  A little oversight.  I'm finding out that you do indeed have to pay that capital gains tax.  I thought that was just a goof.  Well, it's gaining on you.  It is gaining. 
[00:09:00]  All right, let's go back to the phones.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Let's go to Lisa.  Hi, Lisa.  Hi.  How are you?  I was trapped in my car yesterday.  I could not get out.  I was late for class because I could not get out of my car listening to those guys fight.  It was amazing.  I was a half hour late for class, and I didn't even care.  It was the best radio I've ever heard.  It was amazing radio.  I've got to hand it to Billy and Paul for their last appearance ever on our radio show.  Very memorable.  They went out with a bang.  You know what?  I have two kids, and I know how all you had to do was just rub his back and just say, 
[00:09:30]  okay, baby, you can stop crying now because he was just a huge baby.  Well, I kind of feel bad for Billy and Paul because they dug their own grave yesterday.  I feel bad for Paul.  I don't feel bad for Billy.  That seems to be the consensus.  There's a lot of people sympathizing a little more with Paul than with Billy.  Oh, God, Billy, what a crybaby.  Good Lord.  Yeah.  Anyway, that's it.  Love you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Opie Rich from Jersey checking in.  O&A getting syndicated is like Charles Manson getting paroled. 
[00:10:00]  What an analogy that is, huh?  Every time we come up to the parole board for syndication, we just sound like babbling idiots.  Yeah.  Well, I don't need to be paroled because I'm on the outside.  You people are here on the inside.  I'm on the outside already, so I don't need to be paroled.  That's how you sounded when you had to explain yourself to the boss today.  I don't understand what you're talking about because what we did was what we did for sake of doing what we had to do.  Right.  Not what we did for sake of what we might have done if we didn't do what we did. 
[00:10:30]  Ah, screw it.  Who wants to be syndicated anyway?  What the hell's wrong with you, boy?  I've had it last straw.  I've called everyone I can call.  I've even called your goddamn parents.  Trying to get you boys to stop.  Look, I believe you're a very talented boy.  I wouldn't have brought you on board if you weren't.  I've got that.  You can't be doing this. 
[00:11:00]  How many times do I have to say it?  What type of word?  I've got to spell it out.  Am I speaking for a feeling?  No.  No, you're not.  Okay.  We kind of found out today that a month was tacked on to our sentence.  Let's just put it that way.  A month?  Another month.  We don't even know how long we have to wait for this so-called syndication thing.  We don't even know.  A month has been added on to our sentence. 
[00:11:30]  You know what it's like?  You know what it's like?  Did you hear some of the experiences of the Iranian hostages years ago?  Where they used to put the bag over their head and go,  Hey, you go home today.  You go home today.  And they'd bring them out and make them get dressed in their best suit  because they were going home.  And they'd drag them outside of their cell, let them see the car,  drive them around for a while, and drive back to the cell and go,  You're not going home today.  It was like psychological warfare.  That's what they're doing to us. 
[00:12:00]  That's what happens with us.  Syndication now.  Yes, you syndicate today.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Another month.  Oh, well.  At least.  At least.  I don't even want to answer the phone.  I'm expecting a call from Boston.  That's not going to be pretty.  What the hell are you going to do?  You've got to keep your mouth shut.  Woo.  Anyway, let's move on with Roger.  Hi, Roger.  What's up?  Hey, what's happening, fellas? 
[00:12:30]  Hey, man.  Amazing show yesterday.  I was cracking up in the car and the gym everywhere.  Yeah, that was the real stuff.  I think that beats the homeless show, the homeless shopping spree.  Without a doubt.  Another one Jay was involved in.  I never thought the homeless shopping spree would be beaten, but it was yesterday.  Just a quick thing I wanted to say about Paul and Billy.  I mean, it was just unreal what I'm hearing from these guys.  It was kind of like watching wrestling, and your two favorite guys just turned, and you're  just like, no, no, what are you doing? 
[00:13:00]  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Yeah, that was kind of how it was.  Yeah.  Like two good wrestlers going bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were faces, and they turned heel.  Yeah, and like Paul's face turned from happy-go-lucky to like, I'm going to, you know, kick someone's  ass.  Yeah.  That was bizarre.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Roddy.  Syndication, how?  Syndication, how?  That's a good one, man.  That is good.  We don't know.  We're going to be like 65 and finally get syndicated.  Syndication now, O.P. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  We'd like to welcome our affiliate in Bangor, Maine.  It finally happened.  This is great.  Syndication 2045.  This is wonderful.  What the...  This is a new technology.  We're the first, the last Earth-based show to syndicate.  That's great.  They're all syndicated on Venus and Pluto.  We got bang.  That's right.  Now we're in Bangor, Maine. 
[00:14:00]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony family.  Hey, honey, let me see your gas.  This is a funny bit for our new audience.  Bangor, Maine, 2045.  I'm going to punch you in the uterus.  You're a whore.  Ouch.  My teeth fell out.  This is killing me.  Hey, Tom Brokendall, NBC Nightly News. 
[00:14:30]  I've been dead for 20 years, but I'm still doing the news.  Dateline, Bangor, Maine.  We welcome O.P. and Anthony to affiliate WBMN.  Finally, syndication now.  How are you boys doing? 
[00:15:00]  You can't talk like that.  You're going to lose your affiliate.  I'm sorry.  What did we say?  I know you didn't mention the name, but you mentioned the grandchildren's name.  Oh, boy, now it's good.  We just lost our Bangor affiliate.  In the words of Robert Platt, does anyone remember laughter?  I mean, come on. 
[00:15:30]  We're just trying to have fun here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It is what Mel would say, isn't it?  Yeah.  I can't think about that, though.  My butt's sore.  Yeah.  It's a meeting. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, I'm never on the phone at home, ever, with anything concerning the radio.  I'm not.  I just don't get calls at home.  I don't make calls at home.  We do all our business here at the station, and then I leave.  I speak with Opie on the phone, occasionally Rick, but it's usually, you know, what are  you doing?  Yeah.  That was a pretty fun show or something like that.  I was on the phone today.  Making sure you had a job.  I was on the phone today with Ken on GM. 
[00:16:30]  That's just not like you.  I know.  And for once in my career, I'm like, ah, F it.  I'm just like, I'm not even going to call.  Usually I'm on the phone trying to see what's going on.  I'm just like, ah, screw it.  Yeah.  What do we do this time?  Always in it.  Always paying.  I think we still have jobs, though.  Yeah.  Could be.  You'll be waiting for syndication longer than Elion will be waiting for his mom to show 
[00:17:00]  up.  Oh, his mom.  Chaz from Jersey.  Thank you, Chaz.  Did you see that protest?  Yeah.  For Elion?  And they got all out of hand.  They were riotous.  Riotous.  Riotous cubits.  They have this sign, what, pray for Elion?  Mm-hmm.  And they crashed a police blockade gate with it?  What the hell are they doing?  I can understand some people protesting and then crashing through police lines that are 
[00:17:30]  maybe blocking something they want to get to.  What did they want to achieve by breaking through police lines for little Elion?  Elion.  Hey, we got us.  The good Cubans, right?  The cigars.  Yes, we do, Anthony.  But we got to take a quick break here.  Great phones on hold.  If you're on hold, please stay there.  We'll get to you next.  I don't know why we always get ourselves in that situation.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:18:00]  I got to agree with that.  Okay, terrific.  All right, listen, that's a little too real now.  I think that's exactly...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Who had audio in the boss's office?  I just don't want to get yelled at.  That's exactly what I heard today.  Wait, let me hear it one more time.  Isn't that funny when that word actually comes up in a meeting?  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  Stupid!  You know, when was the last time you were called stupid, Opie? 
[00:18:30]  I swear to God.  The last time I was called stupid, I had to be...  I can't even think.  ...had to be elementary school.  Definitely, like, fourth, fifth grade.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Actual audio of our boss.  I swear.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Prove it's not our boss's voice.  I dare you.  That's what we heard.  Oh!  But we're just trying to have some fun. 
[00:19:00]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  That's the voice of a guy that just has had it.  You know what I mean?  I've got to do that!  I've got to do that!  I've got to do that!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Oh, my God.  We were called stupid. 
[00:19:30]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  I swear it had to be third grade.  I threw a thermos, a classmate's thermos, the old glass thermoses, the plaid ones.  They shatter inside?  In the playground against the tree.  And I got called into the principal's office, and the kid that the thermos belonged to was sitting there crying.  And the principal shook the thermos, and it was the broken glass.  And he said, Anthony, why did you do this? 
[00:20:00]  I said, I really don't know.  And he looked at me and said, you know, you're just stupid for doing this.  It's stuck in my head.  Now, fast forward.  Fast forward.  20 years.  20 frigging years.  And all of a sudden, stupid!  You're so stupid!  Once again, I'm being called stupid!  Or at least I have a pal that's also equally as stupid as I.  Open.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:20:30]  What do you say to that one?  Someone calls you stupid.  There's nothing I can say.  There's no response to it.  For the love of God.  You can't say anything back.  Okay.  I'm good.  You're right.  I'm stupid.  Stupid, stupid.  But I got good teeth and good hair.  Old Bill might be stupid, but he runs Old Bill's, Wild Bill's Coffee Shop. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Scott, so you're never called stupid.  Really?  What do you think about that, Scott?  They call this stupid.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  N-E-W.  I have more with your stupid pals, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  New York's Stupid Radio.  O-N-A.  Stupid!  Let it be known, Opie and Anthony.  Just trying to have fun.  We're just trying to have a little fun here.  I just hope someone out there gets it before we get fired.  Stir it up a little.  Have a little bit of fun.  That's all we're trying to do if you think about it, really.  I love your show.  Thank you.  Who's your stupid radio?  O-N-A on N-E-W. 
[00:22:00]  Stupid Radio.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  I love you because you're stupid!  In the case, you never, ever, ever, ever!  Ever!  We're just trying to have fun.  Have a little fun.  Give some people something fun to listen to on the drive home, Opie.  That's right.  That's all we're trying to do if you think about it, really.  A firing offense?  Maybe.  I don't know. 
[00:22:30]  I need a box of donuts.  We're not like the guy that spits in the trooper's burger at the drive-thru.  We're just having fun.  I don't know if we're hurting anyone.  Sure, we might be.  Stupid!  But, uh...  We're just trying to have fun.  Hello, N-E-W.  Hi, this is Corky.  Oh, hi, Corky.  You two are stupid.  Thank you, Corky.  Corky's calling us stupid. 
[00:23:00]  Everyone else is.  Stupid!  And we had the worst timing in the world, too.  I know.  You tell me about it.  I was on the phone.  Oh.  What?  Tom Roker, NBC Nightly News.  This just in, Opie and Anthony dubs stupid.  By their bosses. 
[00:23:30]  Stupid.  We have this clip of the boss.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  This is a piece of audio from the office earlier in the day.  Merrill Lynch downgrading Opie and Anthony to a stupid.  Oh, man.  Stupid.  I swear it was third grade.  I was stupid.  Once again, I'm revisiting stupid. 
[00:24:00]  Stupid.  Let's go back to the phone.  Hello, Opie and Anthony?  Hello?  Hey, Mike Tyson, what's up?  Yeah, you two are stupid.  S-L-D-I-N.  Stupid.  All right.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O-N-A?  How are you?  Great radio yesterday.  Thank you.  I was fortunate to be at the courtyard yesterday.  See that prize fight?  Oh, you were at the prize fight.  Oh, downstairs?  Oh, yeah.  Right around the corner.  Had to check it out.  Nice little crowd forming. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, that was classic.  And there it comes, right out the door.  Makes a beeline for the fat bastard.  That was amazing stuff yesterday.  Yeah, the funniest thing was, after everything, you know, they're all separated.  That fat bastard made a beeline to the first bench he saw.  Huffin' and puffin'.  You faggot.  I don't think anybody...  You faggot.  I don't think anybody's denying the fact that he's overweight.  Oh, a little bit.  Even himself.  And he could get winded like that. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I mean, there's no need to hold this guy back.  He wasn't getting up.  All right.  But, yeah, the gay thing.  Wow.  Just faggot and gay, homo, and then...  Yeah, I mean, you know, he's yelling at everyone, look at him, why don't you go up  there with your faggot?  Yeah, anti-Semitic words, and then the other thing.  I don't know.  And it didn't seem to totally be in fun.  You know, it was worth the, I guess, 30 seconds, though.  Yeah.  All right, thanks.  Thank you, Matt.  Someone has Jay Moore's Bucks hat that you wear on.  Let's hit that.  Bill, what's going on? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You have Jay Moore's Milwaukee Bucks cap from yesterday?  Yeah, I got it.  I swear.  I swear to God, it's green.  I even put it on.  He's got a little tighter head than me, and I got a big head.  Where'd you get the Bucks cap?  Look, you had some guy was there videotaping the heavyset guy before it even began.  I was there while that guy was doing it.  I saw Jay Moore come out.  So instead of breaking it up, I just grabbed his baseball cap for the goof.  I didn't have anything.  I could have, like, jumped in to help Dave, but I'll tell you something. 
[00:26:00]  I saw it unfold, and I know the actual truth.  Do you want to know?  Yeah.  Jay Moore came into the heavyset guy, and the guy was walking towards him, and he just  pushed him.  There was no punching, but...  There was definitely some punching.  There might have been punching after.  Because Jeff Norris' ear is, like, swollen.  Yeah, Jeff Norris took a shot to the side of the head.  Someone picked Jay Moore up immediately, but he didn't get no six punches.  There was a lot of people breaking up the brawl.  Let's just put it that way. 
[00:26:30]  That poor heavyset guy was by himself the whole time.  He even wanted to use my phone to call you guys, and I would have had your hotline, but  I wouldn't even give him my phone.  Hey, Bill, come down with the bucks cap, because I'm sure Jay wants that back, and we'll give  you stuff for it.  Hell no.  Come on.  I need bigger ransom.  You guys...  I want WWF tickets.  You guys are bastards, because someone else stole...  The big wow sign.  Well, someone stole the Jay Moore Map of Hawaii t-shirt that we personally gave Jay, and it's  already on eBay.  Are you kidding?  A piece of valuable... 
[00:27:00]  He does look queer, Jay.  I didn't know his hair was that blonde, and he's got eyebrows that are black.  All right.  Listen.  That's him.  That's him.  But it's on eBay, the t-shirt we gave Jay yesterday.  That guy should...  Valuable memorabilia from the Opie and Anthony show.  It's being listed as the shirt Jay was carrying before he got in the fight outside the  N.E.W. studio.  Huh.  Look for yourself.  It's up for like three, four hundred bucks already.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not kidding.  Freaking people.  I gave it to him after the fight when he was leaving. 
[00:27:30]  Well, how are they going to authenticate that?  They can say it.  They can say it.  Who's ever going to, you know, be able to prove it either way?  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  I was at the Jay Moore show last night, and he was complaining about that douche that  stole the hat.  Yeah.  Well, we try to get it back, but the guy, you know, he's not being cool about it.  Yeah, because he was pissed, because he mentioned that.  He goes, the worst thing about it was I got my hat stolen.  Well, I want, I want, that guy should return the hat, man.  I mean, that's not cool.  Yeah.  Well, somebody in the audience that commented that it was going to be on eBay the next day. 
[00:28:00]  We all, we all want Jay to be wearing a Knicks cap, but I don't know.  I guess he thinks he looks better with the Milwaukee Bucks cap.  Yeah, I was surprised nobody even commented on his selection of team.  We did.  We abused him.  The Bucks, that's like, that's one of the most boring teams in the whole NBA.  Yep.  Hey, how was Jay Moore last night?  Oh, it was excellent.  We left their balls off.  Was he talking about the whole incident on the radio and all?  Yeah, he was talking about it all the time, because, you know, I went and saw Louis Black at the one show.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  And, like, they mentioned, you know, like, who listens to Opie and Anthony?  Everybody was like, eh.  Right.  You know, but at this show, everybody went crazy when he announced that.  That's cool.  And people were yelling, like, air sticks, socks, fat man's fat all night and stuff and all.  Yeah, I feel bad for those guys, because they definitely just dug their own grave yesterday.  Yeah, but.  I don't know where that was coming from.  And they're looking at us, you know, hoping we're going to defend them.  And I don't know.  Yeah, but Jay was, he was trying to shut it off, because he's like, just like, you know, positive energy.  Right, right.  Every time anybody would yell, air sticks, socks, he's like, uh-uh. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  Jay Moore's show tonight.  Right.  Positive energy.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Well, thank you, Dan.  All right.  Well, listen, we've got Jay Moore calling in.  We've been waiting for him to call into the radio show.  I swear I'm not just doing this.  Look at the time for yourself.  We're running really, really late.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll talk to Jay Moore next about his show last night  and how he's feeling today, and hopefully he's not pissed off at us.  All right?  Right.  We'll talk to Jay next.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way. 
[00:29:30]  Stay there.  1027 WNEW.  All right, let's go right to the phones and let's say hi to our pal, Jay Moore.  Hey.  Hi, everybody.  Jay.  Jay, first of all, I want to apologize that I made you wait two minutes there.  No, I hung up and called back.  We usually whisk you right on the air.  No, no, I understand.  You guys have to run your spots, so I just hung up and made coffee, and I called back.  What are we doing, Dee?  I smoke spaz.  Spaz is like, Jay Moore, but Jay Moore just called. 
[00:30:00]  What an idiot.  Oh, we apologize.  You shouldn't be waiting too much.  No, no, no, no.  You've got to run your spots.  You've got to pay for those sponsors.  They're wonderful sponsors.  eBay and, what is it, Mind Spring.  Mind Spring, yeah.  Lovely folks at Lowenbrown.  Rockaway Betty, my personal favorite.  None of them as good as the brilliant Jay Moore, though.  Let me just say that.  Jay, I am stepping aside.  No comedy out of my mouth while you are on the air.  Oh, I don't like this already.  I wouldn't want to step on you. 
[00:30:30]  I don't like this already.  And we all know I'm not.  You can't be like old times.  And we all know I'm not a comic, so I won't even try, so.  Yeah, come on.  You've got to be like old times.  You're letting what Paul and the fat guy said get in your head.  No, not at all, to be honest with you.  You're letting him get in your head.  Not at all.  Get in your head.  What's going on, buddy boy?  It's for that fag that stole my hat.  Yeah, did you hear him?  He said, I don't know, Jay Moore really does look gay.  His hair is really blonde.  Well, we've got him still on the line.  Do you want to confront him?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  You might as well.  I'm gay because I'm blonde.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Bill who has Jay's Milwaukee Bucks cap, and he's now calling Jay gay.  Bill.  You guys, first of all, hung up on me before.  Yeah, we know.  Why?  Because I was saying the truth?  We just hung up on you.  You only want to hear what you guys want to hear.  What's your truth?  Yeah, you guys are very innovative.  We were tired of hearing you.  I think of you, Jay, too.  Jay, you had your boys already set up on that.  They were buzzing around you like bees, and I'm sure they knew if you got hit, they would 
[00:31:30]  have been fired.  You're a sucker.  I don't know about that.  I saw it, Anthony.  I saw it.  And then, you know what?  I saw Anthony later.  He had a white baseball cap on, and he was like a human lizard.  Bill, put it this way.  We have clips of the fights on the unofficial website right now, and it's clear that twice  Jay got through the crowd and got the fat guy.  Through the crowd, through his friends.  That poor heavy fat guy was on his own the whole time.  Bill.  Bill.  Let me just say that.  The fact is, half those guys that were there were part of our show. 
[00:32:00]  Look, you guys can sing together.  You can't talk together one at a time.  Jay Moore, I'm going to do a duty in your hat.  No, there you go.  I got better stand-up than you.  Oh, yeah.  Sure you do, Bill.  I need five minutes.  All right, Bill.  The material is so new, it's sick.  Bill, hurry up, because your 15 minutes of fame has just gone over.  Where's the train here, Anthony?  You look like a human lizard with your big eyes.  Hey, Bill.  You look like a nut.  Yeah, that's me.  I'm going to do number two in your hat, Jay Moore, and I'm hanging up on you guys.  Howard rules. 
[00:32:30]  Howard sure does rule.  Of course he does.  All right.  What's up, Jay?  Did he hang up?  Yeah, he hung up.  What a douchebag.  I'm going to take a dookie in your hat.  Well, that's good stuff.  I'm upset he doesn't find me attractive.  You'll always be attractive to me, Dolly.  That's hysterical when guys call up and they don't find me attractive.  The guy goes, Jay Moore really is gay.  His hair's blonde.  I'm very upset.  That's what he says.  Men don't find me attractive.  And you do have a cute ass, though.  Thank you.  I'm kidding.  What the hell is that about when a guy says you're not attractive? 
[00:33:00]  I know.  Who cares?  I'm in my apartment.  Well, even if you're not invited to the party, you still want the invitation.  Yeah.  Yes.  Even if you don't want to go to the party, you still want the invitation.  Right.  Like, hey, what's wrong with me?  How was the show, man?  Standing ovation, my friend.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's back the truck up.  First of all, I'm going to back up and say that...  Wait.  First of all, no, let me start here.  First of all, you never really said goodbye to us because you rushed out of here because  you were so pissed off.  I was pissed off because I didn't get a clean shot on the fat guy.  All right.  So you left the studio and then what happened? 
[00:33:30]  I left the studio and there's like people milling about the diner.  Like, you're the man.  People are like hanging out.  And, you know, for the record, the people that were holding me back were not my friends.  I brought two people with me and both of them, I told them to let us go.  And it was your guys.  It was Kevin and Jeff Norris.  And Steve.  And Steve.  All guys that most of our listeners have seen on stage at the road show. 
[00:34:00]  Those guys are big boys.  And I only got through Kevin and Steve twice.  Yeah, Kevin is huge.  Kevin was at the show last night.  Oh, was he?  And the fact that he never showed up at RASC.  Nah.  I put out the APB for him.  But, so anyway, but that guy on my hat, that really bothered me more than anything.  The whole thing that I took from the entire day and evening is that I lost my box cap.  And that pissed me off.  And I was going to give that guy like a grand for the hat, too.  Really?  Yeah.  How about I fight that guy for the hat? 
[00:34:30]  Well, let's go to the NBA store and get you another one.  Oh, by the way, that shirt on eBay isn't the shirt because I'm looking at my shirt right now.  Ah, very nice.  So anybody that's a sucker bet, don't take that shirt off eBay.  Tell the guy he's a piece of garbage that's auctioning that off.  Because my map of Hawaii shirt is sitting right here in my chair.  All right, cool.  Now, Jay, so you go to Rascals.  I go to Rascals.  Dina Cole hits the stage and he can't get a word out.  It's literally like when a pro wrestler grabs the mic and he can't talk because they're still screaming.  Yeah.  Like when they lower the mic.  But they're on Dina Cole's side. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  But it's like when the bad wrestler wants to speak.  And everyone's just going ape, ape, ape, you know what?  You don't let him speak?  Sure.  And Dina Cole's just standing there.  And they're like, all right, all right.  And then finally, like literally four minutes, he's going to stand in there smirking.  And he just goes, so what did you guys do today?  Place goes bananas.  And then people have signs.  It's like the front row of WCW. 
[00:35:30]  They got ONA.  They got air sick signs.  They got Jay kicked fat guy's ass.  With a little picture of me kicking somebody.  They got Marco and they got a bull eye on some guy's ass.  Hey!  The shelf life of the Marco thing.  This has got to be bad news by now.  Yeah, right?  I think like last night was when you actually take the milk out and it is the day of the exploration.  You can use it anyway.  It smells good.  It smells all right, but even though it says the fish.  Yeah, it's not lumpy when I put it in the coffee. 
[00:36:00]  It's got to be good.  No, it's all right.  It's got to cheese then.  Yeah.  The show is great.  Tonight, Stephen Lynch is going to come down and Corbett's coming down.  All right.  Which rascals?  West Orange, I'm assuming?  West Orange, yeah.  I'm assuming?  Okay.  But more importantly, first of all, I'm gay because I have blonde hair.  Was that that guy's rationale?  Yeah, I didn't get that either.  He goes, I saw Jay Moore.  He really is gay.  His hair is blonde.  Woo!  Yeah!  I got smoke coming out of my ass. 
[00:36:30]  I'm so gay.  That's a large gay population.  I have a leather pinata in my living room.  I have an aquarium.  It's filled with pink fish.  Hey, I heard Shecky Green do that leather pinata line way back.  Three times last night, after a bit, as they were doing the applause, I'd go, I stole that.  I'm a pleasure going on.  Jay, let me put this on the record.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  Best radio show I've ever been involved with yesterday. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, that was something.  I heard you say that earlier, and you know what flattered me the most was second place  I was involved with also.  Oh, that's right.  Yes, the homeless shopping spree.  We've got to do a homeless casino.  That's going to be the best thing ever.  I'll have to do that.  The best, you've got to be prepared to leave in cuffs.  We're going to do that in the summertime, yes.  You guys, I think maybe Friday we should all, when I have nothing to plug, let's get everybody 
[00:37:30]  together again.  Well, why don't we, let's like go out.  Let's go out.  Yeah, totally.  But let's get these guys in the studio again.  Oh, really?  Nah.  Yeah.  No, I think at this point we need the after fight party.  Like we need like, we need the swimming pool and the chicks.  The lesbian kiddie pool needs to come out of hiding.  Yeah.  Right.  We'll get some girls in here to beat the crap out of each other.  I said, I'll fight any chick in here. 
[00:38:00]  And then some chick in the front row, like gigantic cans, stood up and went, wow.  And I was like, I'll fight any chick in here that's not that excited to fight me.  Yeah.  Hey, what was going on with your manager who showed up very concerned late in the festivities?  He seemed like he was really mad at Aunt and I.  Oh, yeah.  My manager and my agent were like, I was talking to my agent last night.  He's like, he said he went up to him and he's like, you call this comedy?  Is this comedy?  What, for your little ratings?  You let this go on for your little ratings?  He was all pissed off and like, I kind of took offense to that because he's going, he's 
[00:38:30]  like, yeah, oh, oh, it was good for your ratings though, right?  It was good for your ratings though, right?  It's like, Jesus Christ.  Dude.  He just thought I was going to, he didn't know who was who and he just, it was like just  a melee of like, big bodies.  And at that point you can't stop it.  You got to let it play out.  And even Matt Frosty was going, screaming at Anthony, he said he was going, well, are you  your little ratings?  You proud of yourself, your little ratings?  First of all, he wasn't, first of all, he wasn't screaming.  Secondly, he didn't understand what the hell was going on because I was the one that was 
[00:39:00]  keeping, trying to keep people from actually punching each other.  The ratings would have been, oh yeah, that would have been great if somebody would have  bled.  But it wouldn't have been very, very nice here in the studio.  And then he demanded to talk to the general manager.  The general manager.  What's up with him?  The general manager was busy with other problems.  In the case you never?  Yeah.  Don't even mention what you want to mention because we're in hot water.  Oh man.  Yeah.  It is like Manson's parole hearing.  Hey man, I'm everywhere. 
[00:39:30]  I'm on the 405.  I'm in the San Diego Zoo.  Nixon was just kidding, man.  Hey, who you stole that from?  I stole that from Adam Sandler.  It was a sketch he did when he imitated Manson.  Very good.  And I told you, I did just steal those lines out of the mouth of a sketch.  Wow.  Yeah.  But that's actually what Manson said.  So Sandler was saying what Manson said during a sketch, but I would not have remembered  it had I not seen Sandler do the sketch.  All right.  At least you learned something from yesterday's show, Jay. 
[00:40:00]  I thought Paul Bond was going to cry towards the end of that show.  Yeah, there was something going on there where I think he was starting to regret.  It was starting to sink in that, you know, the last appearance on the Anthony show.  Oh, really?  The two of them broke up.  How do you know?  Because Dina Cola called me and told me.  How does Dina Cola know?  Dina Cola.  Paul Bond called Dina Cola and said the two of them split up.  Wow.  Well.  You guys don't see that?  That's like big news.  Well, it's not exactly Lennon and McCartney. 
[00:40:30]  Wouldn't worry about it.  Andy Kindler.  Abedin Costello maybe.  Andy Kindler.  One more time.  Andy Kindler has a joke.  He says, everyone thinks the Beatles broke up because of Yoko Ono.  He goes, no, I think the Beatles broke up when Paul McCartney came downstairs and went,  hey, John, how about this?  Oh, blee, D.  Oh, blee.  I don't know Paul enough.  I can't take it anymore.  Wow.  Jay Moore.  Terrific.  Oh, really?  Andy Kindler. 
[00:41:00]  That's a joke I wish I wrote, but I did not.  It was a joke that Andy Kindler wrote.  Very funny young man.  A five foot seven brown hair.  Yeah, give it this good.  Glasses.  Gotta plug his name.  Nathan, Los Angeles, hangs out with Sarah Silverman.  Another guy could confirm the breakup of the comedy team of Billy and Paul.  Wow.  Some guy, John.  Let's see what he has to say.  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Well, here's what I got, at least, anyway.  Airsick.net is now offline. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  There's a note from Billy on there saying that it's being revised.  They're probably taking your links off of there and stuff.  That's all right.  And, yeah, please stay tuned for this great new website.  We already took the Airsick link off the unofficial website that only has one and a half million hits.  So it sounded more and more like, hey, Jay.  Yes, sir.  Excellent job yesterday.  Thank you.  I wish to God I could have come and had your back for you.  I wish you were there to take my buck cap.  Well, I would definitely give it back. 
[00:42:00]  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  You know, marketing terms, if one person's thinking something, then 50,000 people are thinking it.  I'm thinking I want to come out swinging as soon as I see this guy on the street.  Whoa.  He can't do that.  No, he lost bad yesterday.  He's in his own hell right now, I think.  I suppose that's true.  I wouldn't worry about it.  It just got me so revved up listening to that yesterday.  I got it.  Well, if anybody cares, I'd really like a buck cap.  You'll take care of it.  Yeah, we got to get you a buck cap. 
[00:42:30]  I like the bucks.  I like the Knicks.  I just dig the buck cap with that big 10-point deer on the front of it.  Hey, you know how many bucks you're going to get now?  You know how many people are going to throw caps on stage at Rascos and West Orange?  I love $20 bills.  I stole that from no one.  You are the greatest, most original comic I've ever heard in my life, Jay Moore.  I know it, and thank you.  And someone, just for a goof, throw a blue boy on stage tonight, Rascos.  A blue boy.  You're cross-dressing magazine on the front row.  Wait, here's the bid for tonight's show with Jay Moore. 
[00:43:00]  Bring stuff to throw on stage to Jay Moore.  No.  Come on.  The guy's trying to do his ass.  Not throw at Jay, but just make sure it gets to the stage.  Just hand it to your fellow Opie and Anthony Lester.  I'm telling you, I know why.  Someone's going to throw one, and they're going to look hard.  I also have to admit, Jay, I've been walking around doing a really bad Christopher Walken  these past few months.  I promise I will never do it again.  Well, stay at it, my friend.  Stay in the course, young Jedi.  You're ripping off Jay.  Goes around and comes around, I guess. 
[00:43:30]  That's right.  No one will know.  No one will know.  There goes John.  Yeah, if you encourage people to throw stuff on stage.  I didn't say throw.  I didn't say throw.  Just kind of get stuff on stage.  I'm telling you, not everyone's sitting right by the stage.  All right.  So if someone's going to toss it, and I'm telling you, rascals, the security, God bless  them, the security there is tight, man.  All right.  If someone tosses something on stage, I'm telling you right now, they're getting yanked.  They'll be wrestled to the ground.  Like Mark David Chapman.  Oh, yeah.  But you could just be wrestled to the ground. 
[00:44:00]  By the time that thing lands, they're yanked out of their seats.  Listeners, listen to me.  Don't tell anything.  Even if it's just for fun, if you want to show me something, I'm just...  Tell a friend.  You'll get yanked.  Yeah, just kind of...  Yeah, whatever.  Hold it up.  Be cool.  Right.  Yes, I have the AirSick site up due to certain changes within AirSick Productions.  The site is temporarily unavailable.  Paul Bond called Mikey Nicola.  Wow.  This is like a WWF saga. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, it really is.  What's that caller say?  Like two good wrestlers going 10?  Yeah.  Like when Jimmy Snuka turned evil and you were all pissed off?  More like when Chief J Strongbow went...  Hey, like Chief J, how could you?  Yeah, when he went...  What about Jules?  When he went against Bruno, I believe, right?  Well, you're a little older than me.  Oh, come on.  I'm going Morocco Snuka.  That's pretty good.  I'm talking more like Ernie Ladd.  Ivan Putzke.  Ivan Putzke, the Polish Hammer.  That's right.  Haystacks Calhoun.  That's what the fuck I look like. 
[00:45:00]  You're more like the Hillbilly Jim.  Me?  Yeah.  I'm one of the Guerrero brothers.  Guerrero brothers.  Uh-oh.  Last night my intro was,  and middleweight champion of the O.B. and Anthony show.  And I went off to the team from Rocky.  Hey, how you did?  I was thinking that.  That would be a good entrance.  How did Jeff Norris do last night?  Are you killed?  Really?  Because I just saw his face outside the studio.  Get Jeff to say hi to J-Rill fans.  Jeff was like destroyed last night. 
[00:45:30]  Karate guy, man.  Would you even attempt to F with this guy?  No.  Jeff was the only one that,  Jeff took the worst punch yesterday.  I know.  This guy is dead.  The national judo champion.  A brick S house.  There's Jeff.  What's up, man?  Hey, what's up?  Jeff Norris.  Grab that mic over there.  Let's see your ear.  Oh, it's still swollen.  I'm going to the doctor today to get it drained.  Drained?  I'm going to get it drained.  It's cauliflower, man.  I've got more cauliflower in my ear than that fat bastard got in his refrigerator.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  He's got to get his ear drained, man.  Which one?  What's on?  That one's good.  Go ahead.  Drained?  Yeah.  What do they pull out of there?  They stick a needle in it.  Yeah.  And they've got to drain the fluid out.  Fluid.  Yeah.  We'll be in our kitchen for another couple days.  Hey, Jay.  What's up, man?  How you doing, Jeff?  Great job last night.  You were excellent.  It was a real pleasure.  Thank you.  Look at that, huh?  See?  It was beautiful.  Comics getting along.  It's a beautiful thing.  I had a great time last night.  Jay Destroyed.  Jay, I got your Bucks cap, man.  No, you didn't.  I swear to God.  It's in my trunk.  Really?  Yes, I do.  Oh, well, you know what?  It's fine. 
[00:46:30]  I do.  It's not a gay thing, people.  It's just a token of my appreciation for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime last night.  I'm telling you, last night on stage, somebody said, we're Marco Gay, something.  I go, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to sell out the awesome team.  I'm going to be like, O.B. and Anthony, me, Stephen Lynch, we'll just get all the cavalry together  and sell out like a 10,000-seat place.  Let's go.  All I'm going to do is put my wife on stage and bang her for an hour.  I'm going to bang my wife in front of 10,000 people with a mic, with a mic like Judy, the 
[00:47:00]  time wife operator on the air.  Right, and do your act.  And I'll be like, huh?  Gay?  Who's gay?  Look how hot she is.  This is one hot piece.  Say hi, honey.  Shut up.  Hey, for that guy who called before who got your hat, he's a lying little, can I say prick?  Yeah.  He's a lying little prick because I was standing right next to Jay, and he threw some massive  shots.  He threw some, that was about as fake as nothing.  That was true blue.  Well, I learned a very valuable lesson yesterday. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Don't ever hit a fat guy in the stomach.  Jay, you've got to come down to judo school and sign up.  Yeah, I might as well.  Do you know Jeff's credentials?  Yeah, he's like national judo champion.  Yeah.  He's kicked some serious ass in his day.  Well, look at his arms.  Who cares what he's done?  I know.  He's got insane.  He's got these huge arms, and then he's got like karate tattoos.  If you're making the commitment with you're going to tattoo karate stuff on your arms,  you better be able to kick some ass.  That'd be funny.  That'd be really funny to just have a skinny guy, like just a weakling guy walking around 
[00:48:00]  like with all the karate tattoos.  Yes, that's how much.  A little karate tattoo.  That's a skinny white guy playing, I guess, like Pekka would tattoo to his neck.  And then like a Nazi thing on his back so nobody bothers him.  It's like he's skinny, but he must be crazy.  He's got Pekka would on his neck.  All right, Jay, calm down.  You're taking over the show again.  Sorry.  We don't need that.  We don't need people laughing.  Oh, my God.  I am sorry.  We don't need people laughing because you're taking over the show.  Another day of a gay more, I guess. 
[00:48:30]  Jesus.  I didn't know Jay Moore was gay.  I didn't know he had blonde hair.  Yeah, I got blonde hair.  I swear to God.  Well, you're a bag, right?  Well, I'm gay on Tuesday.  I'm not sure I'm not real blonde.  I'm dirty blonde.  That's just Tuesday and Thursday gay.  We're going to sell out the Beacon Theater, and I'm just going to bang my wife for an  hour and a half.  Yeah, I like the idea.  Can you know what will happen?  At the end of the show, people come up and go, hey, that was a great banging, you fag.  You know, you're way banged.  It was fake.  I wasn't really stroking. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, can I bang your wife, too?  Sure.  What a guy.  Now, that's a friend.  And then he can be sloppy 70 seconds.  Oh, my God.  Well, pick straws.  See who gets to go first.  I go first.  All right.  I don't want any of you animals in there first.  Unbelievable.  You people.  Well, I'm telling you.  I said that on stage last night.  I said that's what I'm going to have to do to prove I'm not gay.  And then people still won't believe it.  Let's get Buddy Hackett to start the festivities.  Well, when I drop the flags, start screwing. 
[00:49:30]  Well, she's a nice girl, but rest of the festivities, she could kill more penises than potatoes.  Buddy Hackett came out in the act last night.  Excellent.  I thought he was there.  I swear to God, I was in the bathroom.  I'm like, holy Christ, Buddy's here.  You ever hear that joke?  Jay's mouth is on the side of his face by his ear, telling Buddy Hackett.  I was dying.  The joke, you guys, is this guy goes to the doctor's office.  He's got a lump in his forehead.  You got to do it like Buddy Hackett? 
[00:50:00]  Well, I go to the doctor's office because he's got a lump in his head.  It looks a little bit like a coma.  And he's nervous.  So, you know, I go to the doctor's office.  And the doctor says, in all my years of medical school, 44 years to be a Jack,  I've only seen this once before.  It's not a coma.  What this is, is you actually have a penis growing out of your forehead.  And the guy goes, what? 
[00:50:30]  He goes, yeah, and over the course of time, it'll be just like you're going through adolescence.  Three, four years from now, you'll have a regular-sized penis hanging off your forehead.  It's really remarkable, actually.  It's only happened once before in my entire medical history.  The guy says, well, cut it out.  You got to cut it off.  My head, you can't cut it off.  Can't cut it off.  It's attached to the frontal lobe of your brain.  And the brain stem, if I cut it off, you'll drop dead right on the floor in a pile of bones.  You won't even feel anything.  You just drop right there. 
[00:51:00]  You can't cut it off.  The guy goes, well, what the hell am I going to do every day?  I got to look in the mirror and see a penis growing out of my forehead.  The doctor says, you won't have to worry about that.  He says, why not?  He says, because your balls will cover your eyes.  That's pretty good.  Buddy, huh?  Gentlemen?  You better give Buddy Hacky credit for that one.  That was Buddy Hacky.  No, Buddy Hacky actually just said the joke.  Buddy's there. 
[00:51:30]  Buddy's here at my house.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm gay.  All right, so rascals tonight.  Rascals tonight, Corbett will be there, and Stephen Lynch is supposed to be there.  He's going to call me back, but I think he told me last night he's definitely going to be there.  All right, cool.  But, you know, Lynch, he's a drunk.  All right.  I will talk to you guys soon, and I say Friday we have a big party when I have nothing to plug.  Definitely.  And I appreciate everything you guys did, except for holding me back yesterday.  The lesbian kiddie pool comes out.  Yes. 
[00:52:00]  I think my junk might come out.  All right.  The lesbian kiddie pool, but one of them has to be bi in case my junk comes out.  Right.  All right.  Put the chlorine in that pool, because those chicks are dirty.  All right.  Jay Moore.  Rascals.  Oh, there he goes.  Rascals West Orange tonight.  Is he gone?  Yeah.  Thank God.  How much more of him are we going to put on this show?  He wrecks it with his whole gay thing.  He's just on all the time.  Jeez.  Jay Moore.  Doesn't have any original material. 
[00:52:30]  He steals from everybody.  All right, Aaron.  We love him.  And Jeff Norris, of course.  The guy is a constant hit on this show.  I don't care what anyone says.  Jeff, I'm glad you have our back.  All the time.  All the time.  That's nice to have somebody with that kung fu crap.  You know, I was going to bitch yesterday with Paul and Fat Boy up here.  I could have said, hey, I was the first guest ever.  Yeah.  Where's my NEW jacket?  Yeah, right?  We're handing out memorabilia.  Yeah.  That was nuts.  We don't need someone like Jeff Norris turning against us. 
[00:53:00]  That's for sure.  No.  No, man.  I'm always on your side.  No.  That would be a bad thing.  Never happens.  Never happens.  I'm going to sign up with Jay's bodyguard.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Big Billy, I think his name.  Billy and Kevin.  Man, I tell you.  You would frighten me.  Why?  I would just run as fast as I could.  I'd just run screaming like a woman.  Running away.  That's me.  Just running as fast as I could. 
[00:53:30]  I wouldn't care who was watching.  It would be like girls watching.  You know, I have to stand up for myself in front of a crowd of people.  But if Jeff comes up and wants to kick my ass, I'm running away.  All right.  And let's take a break.  I just cleared the phones.  If I hung up on you, I apologize.  But we have to give away some wrestling tickets, okay?  The winner receives a three-pack of tickets to the WWF event at the Garden.  April 15th.  We'll take the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027. 
[00:54:00]  Opie and Anthony.  It's a Kevlar kind of day.  1027-WNEW.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy there.  Our favorite Italian restaurant.  Why?  Because, well, because we eat there for free.  No, come on.  You don't think Joey's going to turn on the show, do you? 
[00:54:30]  That's another guy we don't want turning on the show.  No, we love Joey.  Joey treats us great when we go down to Paisano.  You've got to go down there.  If you're in Little Italy, you need a great Italian food at reasonable prices.  A lot of people have turned on this show, right, Anthony?  Yeah, I know, but not Joey.  Tara, Spike.  Joey is...  William Paul now.  Joey is a loyal guy.  Joey won't...  And we are loyal to Joey.  And Joey won't turn on us, right?  No.  I'm positive of that.  He's a Paisano.  All right, good.  Come on.  Good, good.  You want great Italian food? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Huge portions?  Oh, yeah.  Nice Italian atmosphere.  Great place to take a date.  The family.  And don't forget about their incredible pasta lunch specials.  Look at this.  All the time we've been talking about Paisano, I'm thinking like dinner.  You go down there to dinner.  Maybe, you know, it's late at night.  Take the girl down there or something.  How about their lunch specials?  Incredible pasta lunch specials.  And they're huge.  I defy you to finish them. 
[00:55:30]  You take them home with you.  All right.  Have that for dinner.  Also, ask for Joey.  Tell them, hey, man, Opie and Anthony sent us to your fine restaurant.  And Joey's going to give you a glass of wine in the house, okay?  Right.  And speaking of wine, Paisano's got a fantastic wine list.  They really do.  I've tried just about every bottle he has.  And Opie's staggered out of the door a couple of times.  A few times.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give Joey and the gang a call.  965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:56:00]  Drone men jumping all over each other.  Okay.  Terrific.  1027.  WNEW.  We're marching.  Marching to victory.  You know what I like about our listeners? 
[00:56:30]  What's that?  You said it in the back office.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Our listeners love and want to fight.  They love a good battle.  They love a good battle.  As we all do.  Wow.  Stone Temple Pilots on TRL. 
[00:57:00]  TRL.  Yep.  Aw.  Cool, man.  They didn't show up at Rascals.  No, they didn't?  I think Baby Jay was lying.  No.  What about that?  Scott Wyland looks great.  He has Jay's Bucks cap.  There's the band.  Wow.  The first, like, real band TRL has had on.  Right?  Yeah, you can tell because it's not like a hundred screaming teeny boppers.  Oh, it's insane.  Come on.  Oh.  All right.  I need the grease. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  Rob's wearing the same jacket from the plane.  Yeah, he is.  That's what he was wearing when we were coming back from L.A.  Yes.  All right, Ann.  We definitely got to get into other things today.  We have, um, lots to talk about.  Uh, Darver Conger.  Yeah.  She's officially single again, like, getting her annulment.  Who cares?  She's got a total media whore.  She's a chick from Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire or whatever.  She's now officially divorced.  Gone.  That story's ancient.  Gone. 
[00:58:00]  There's a big piece of paper.  Sorry.  Huge.  Huge piece of paper.  All the newspapers are calling us about the Jay incident.  Yeah, I know.  You know what?  Can't do it to our pal.  We've got to ask them if we should talk about it to the press, because they're all calling  now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, get them on the phone.  Because I think it would be cool that we just tell the papers, like, all these just nasty  rumors about Jay.  And see if they'll print them. 
[00:58:30]  I don't know.  He's a lunatic.  I think he's addicted to crack.  And he always carries a gun and waves it around.  Right.  And in the middle of the interview, he went in the bathroom with a little boy.  I don't know what that was about.  Oh, my God.  And made him do crack.  Guy's going to be in a hit movie.  Come on.  Come on.  He told us on the side that he's in love with Kevin Spacey. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  Well, then, what do you want to do?  You want to play one of the entries in the Most Offensive Song Contest?  I think we can do that.  Yesterday, we weren't able to fit any in.  The Most Offensive Song Contest.  I don't know why.  The Most Offensive Song Contest still on here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And the goal of this contest is for us to find the most offensive song ever to be played on the radio.  And let me tell you, we've had some real contenders.  Oh, wait.  We have the Daily News calling back. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah?  She doesn't want to talk to you guys on the air.  Son of a bitch.  We have to.  We're on the air.  You want to pick her up real quick?  Pick her up where she's not on the air.  You are.  Oof.  Hello?  Stand pole.  All right.  Well, tell her, I don't know.  Tell her we'll talk to her during commercials or something.  That's why we're called stupid when we do things like...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  That's us. 
[01:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid radio.  All right, Ant.  The Most Offensive Song Contest.  Yeah, so we're looking for the most offensive song ever to air on any radio station anywhere.  Correct.  And we've had some real contenders.  Oh, yeah.  The KKK song.  The...  What was the other one?  The Camp Concentration?  No, no.  The Horny for Little Girl.  Horny for Little Girl.  That is so offensive.  For Little Girls.  Where is that song?  That is really offensive. 
[01:00:30]  Whoa, look at Spaz go.  He is fast.  Oh, my God.  He's like a duck with those feet.  Does he take pro wrestling classes or something?  What did I see yesterday?  That's another...  That went away.  Yes, so we have these offensive songs.  We had a couple come in yesterday and today.  Contenders, man.  Now, if anybody wants to complain about these songs,  because there are a few people that really are offended by these.  And we understand that.  We totally understand because the essence of the contest 
[01:01:00]  is indeed to have the most offensive song on the radio.  Right.  So you're going to be offended.  What can I say?  That's what we're looking for.  We don't condone what these songs are saying.  We don't agree with their content.  All we can say is, yes, they are indeed offensive.  We agree with you.  And if you're going to have a most offensive song contest,  you can't really sugarcoat it.  You can't.  It has to be offensive.  When we're listening to these songs in the back office, 
[01:01:30]  it's kind of painful.  If we took an offensive song and said,  we can't air this because it's too offensive,  well, that's the contest.  Well, let's play our last entry from last week.  Okay.  Which one was this?  I'm horny for little girls.  I'm horny for little girls.  And then we're going to play right after that a twofer.  A twofer because it is from the same artist.  It's an offensive twofer.  Right?  From Q?  Yeah, from Q.  Yeah.  So this is what Q said last week.  And right after this, we'll play the one that we got today. 
[01:02:00]  It's brand new.  You've never heard it.  Okay?  All right.  But I think I'm horny for little girls is worth one more play  in the most offensive song contest.  Is CBS going to intro this?  Ron Love?  No.  Each time I see a little girl of eight or nine or ten,  I can't resist the urge to stick my tongue inside of them  because I'm horny for little girls.  For little girls have hairless little tw***s. 
[01:02:30]  Virgil.  I'm horny for little girls.  I get them a F on alcohol and pot.  That little butt so very so tight and shiny  Makes you want to stash your junk inside her f***s.  I'm horny for little girls. 
[01:03:00]  I want to bang them all, sometimes as young as one or two.  And then I kill them when I am school.  I'm horny for little girls.  I tape their mouths and tie them to the wall.  I'm horny for little girls.  I bite them and I make them lick my b***h. 
[01:03:30]  It's coming, it's coming.  It's the little nips so helpless and appealing.  I want to slice them off and mount them on the ceiling.  It's coming.  I'm horny for little girls.  I'm horny for them all.  No matter where, no matter who, without them my old b***h would be blue. 
[01:04:00]  Virgin.  I'm horny.  Virgin.  I'm so horny.  Virgin.  I'm horny for little girls.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  Come and sip on my lap, little girl.  I have some candy for you.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, there it is.  From Q.  We have a new entry from Q we're going to get to in a second here. 
[01:04:30]  Steve from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website, foundrymusic.com.  Speaking of the offensive songs, the KKK man song is just obliterating the competition.  I think it's up to 775 votes.  The closest one after that is 500.  The audience seems to be composed primarily of racists.  Interesting.  Huh.  Well, I wouldn't say that.  Yeah.  All right.  Gee.  Let's go to Doug before we get to Q's latest entry in the most offensive song contest.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You guys got really beat up bad in an article today in the Daily Record in Morris County, New Jersey. 
[01:05:00]  Like we care.  I know, but this lady was screaming about you guys picking on the guy that couldn't get out of the chair at the Oscars.  That's what she picked from our show to write about?  I know.  She's got almost a half-page ad about it.  Could you send the article in to us?  Do you want me to give you the webpage and you can look it up yourself?  Yeah, go ahead.  www.dailyrecordsoneword.com, page A11.  Page A11? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Yep, bye.  I don't think I care.  Ooh, you heard us by writing bad things about us in the paper.  I don't think anything was ever written good about our show in the paper.  Never.  You looking that up?  Trying.  All right.  While you get to that, let's get to the latest entry in the most offensive song contest.  It's another one from Q.  Do we even know the name of this one?  I know it's done to John Lennon's Imagine.  Imagine.  Oh, imagine there's no...  Great. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, this is...  Like I said, now, I can't stress this enough.  Look, this contest is getting way out of hand, man.  I'm serious.  It's getting harder and harder to start these songs every day.  Can you read the title?  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  Imagine there's no...  Ouch.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, you've got to understand, again, I can't stress this enough.  It is, indeed, the most offensive song contest.  So what are we supposed to do?  Get the most offensive song in and in the office, listen to it, and go, 
[01:06:30]  Oh, my God, that's too offensive.  That's like somebody in a race in the Olympics on track saying,  Oh, he's too fast.  We've got to take it.  We've got to play it.  It's the most offensive song.  And Q makes fun of a lot of different people in this song.  Yes.  It just starts off really, really ugly and doesn't get much better from there.  Nope. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, no.  Come on, Ant.  What?  What?  I'm losing my balls.  This contest just sucks now.  It was all cute and fun at first, but...  Yeah, I know, but...  All right, well, here we go.  It's the latest entry in the most offensive song contest on the Opie and Anthony show.  Another one by Q.  Q.  Imagine there's no...  Check it out for yourself.  Imagine there's no freaking niggas. 
[01:07:30]  Imagine there ain't no freaking jiggle bulls, no bull and yons, and no spokes.  There ain't no big, scary darkies running around out there.  And of course, no freaking Arabs, no Hindus, no spits, and no freaking blutes. 
[01:08:00]  Imagine nothing but freaking Italians.  Every freaking way you go.  What the hell, man?  What is that?  There seems to be something underneath it.  What's going on?  There's a commercial in the background.  Is someone using the other studio?  Who did that?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now there's hell to pay.  Who did it?  Someone screwed up.  Who did it?  Another fight today.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  There's a commercial in the back of the song.  That would not be good.  Yeah.  That would be a horrible, horrible thing.  Horrible?  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  We're going to have to re-record it.  Re-record it?  Oh, my God.  Don't keep a little while.  All right.  Well, now we're going to have to take a break, Anthony.  Wow, what a cluster F.  Come on.  All right.  I mean, we got the gist of it, though. 
[01:09:00]  No, it balanced out after that.  That's why we need to play more of it.  I know.  I know.  What, it gets worse?  Well, he moves on to, like, just about every ethnic group.  New song is hilarious.  We played 20 seconds of it.  All right.  We'll try to get the problem figured out, and we'll be back after this.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  We're back from a little commercial break there. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  We had to do a quick interview with the, what, the Daily News, eh?  Daily News.  Yeah.  About the Jay Moore incident.  I have a feeling our names are going to be all over the paper tomorrow on many different subjects.  A couple of subjects, you think?  Just a couple.  Oh, but the lady from the Daily News really liked our quote.  Yeah.  We're very quotable, Anthony.  Well, you know what it is?  I believe we give one of the most candid interviews you will ever, ever read. 
[01:10:00]  We don't care what we say.  I wonder if she's going to print what I said.  I said, I think Jay Moore's on crystal meth.  And then she was a little shocked when I actually outed him as a child toucher.  Right.  She's like, really?  I'm like, well, yeah, we can't confirm it, but he does disappear a lot.  Oh, my God.  That's insane.  Can I quote that?  Yeah, why not?  Quote that.  Quote whatever the hell you want. 
[01:10:30]  Jay's going to be performing at Chuck E. Cheese.  Yeah.  He's going to be in the ball pit.  Kid's coming out on that little slide with their pants down.  No, come on.  We're kidding.  Jesus Christ.  Why is everybody so sensitive?  You had the best sarcastic quote for the Daily News, though.  The film, Kevin Spacey, Face.  Oh, yes, yes.  I never, that's what I said.  I said I never knew or expected Jay Moore, a huge Hollywood star, was going to be starring in a movie with Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey. 
[01:11:00]  Because they love writing the stories, and then in bold print now she could put Kevin Spacey.  So it'll catch your eye.  What's Kevin Spacey?  A fight?  Kevin Spacey's name is coming up?  You were surprised that...  I was very surprised that...  That he would put his pretty face in danger.  Right.  Knowing that he's filming this movie with the Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey.  That's what I wanted to say before Rick rudely interrupted me with a piece of paper in front of my effing face.  Jesus. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, so I was very surprised that he would do that.  And then she was trying to...  She was saying, what started the actual brawl?  She goes, what made Billy take his headphones off?  I said, well, at one point I believe Billy used a derogatory term, Jay, referring to him as some form of homosexual.  I believe the word was faggot.  At which point, Jay turned to Billy and called him a big fat F.  And I didn't say F. 
[01:12:00]  I used the real word, Opie, if you notice.  I wonder if they could print that in the Daily News.  She was horrified.  Horrified.  She says, this is great stuff.  These are quotable in Swank Magazine.  We told her it was like recess in seventh grade.  It was.  Insane.  Out on the football field.  Let's go.  I was waiting outside for too long.  Where's Jay Moore?  I want to kick his ass.  My brother Joe made his way into the studio. 
[01:12:30]  He was here yesterday, but you actually, look at you.  You got bumped yesterday.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I came in with your song parody.  I got bumped for a comic.  For a comic.  Right.  Yeah, usually the comics get bumped.  Usually the comics get bumped.  So he got bumped yesterday.  He had a most offensive song that he wants to add into the contest.  Two.  Two of them.  But let's just say he has one, and then he's, he found an anonymous one.  I don't know where it is, but it's not him.  He wants to stress it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And look who we brought with him.  Our pal, Cowbell Beale. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, Beale, you're a pop-a-nugget.  You're in Florida, and we were playing, I was doing a little imitation of you.  Wait, I think we got a little piece of that.  Oh, no.  I was doing impressions of Beale, because you weren't here.  Take a listen to this, as Cowbell Beale says.  If you pop the nugget and then go for a long walk, you'll get cranky ass.  You know, it's like you had to really force out that last milk thug.  And then you take a long walk, you're going to get cranky ass. 
[01:13:30]  Sometimes you don't know that little milk thug is still dangling.  And you get up.  Anything over about a quarter mile, and you got cranky ass.  You don't want cranky ass.  Got to make sure you clean up.  Get every little nugget out.  I'm doing impressions of my pal.  I feel.  I feel.  It's like somebody took a fistful of corn fakes and jammed them up there. 
[01:14:00]  Goddamn.  Cowbell Bill.  Very quotable himself.  Yes, we should have had Bill on the interview.  The pool rack filled with afro.  I'll never forget that one.  To describe a very hairy woman.  Yeah.  Take the pool rack off the pool table, fill it with afro hair, and shove it down there.  A piece of silly putty that fell on the barbershop floor.  Oh, we got a ton of them.  Got a million of them.  All right, listen.  Jeff Norris, you leaving us? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, I'm going to get my ear drained.  We got someone else to beat up or something?  No, he's got to get his ear from the fight.  Yeah.  Drained.  You got fluid in your ear?  I ain't commenting on that.  So who actually stuck their hand in your ear yesterday?  Billy.  A doctor's going to really stick his hand in your ear.  Wow.  And now a doctor's going to poke you in your ear.  Ear.  E-A-R.  I said ear.  That's what I was saying.  Your ear.  Your ear.  So a doctor's going to take his needle and shove it in your ear.  In my ear.  And suck out fluid. 
[01:15:00]  Jeff.  Jeff, yesterday I thought I saw blood coming out of your ear.  Well, I did eat a Taco Bell, so that might be true.  That might be true.  Man, that was pretty good, man.  It was rough.  Your ear is red.  Yeah.  Everyone was yelling, hit the one in the middle.  But it was three guys.  It was Billy.  Looks like you got takeout cauliflower.  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  That's a huge, huge ear.  It's all right.  You've been knocked in there before, right?  Funny, this will be the fifth drainage of this year.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Left one's a bad one.  Thanks, Bill, for not hitting my left ear.  Why are you always getting knocked in the...  In your ear.  Well, it all started when I did a show in the East Village.  Slammed in your ear again.  Competition.  Damn.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, fellas.  No problem, man.  I'm going to plug Jay Moore.  Jay Moore playing Rascals tonight.  Yeah, you got to see him.  He's fucking Jay Moore.  Kinky.  Who hasn't?  You got to go to Rascals.  All right.  He's fabulous.  Stay care, fellas. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you.  All right, Ant.  We got the situation with Imagine, the song done by Q.  I'm distracted because Jeff is saying his goodbyes.  Yeah, the latest entry in the most offensive song contest by Q.  Yes.  Who is the author of I'm Horny for Little Girls.  Mm-hmm.  He gave us another entry today, Anthony.  Really wants to win this contest.  And we started the song, but there was some kind of either complaint call or a commercial in the background.  Some type of glitch.  So we had to stop the song, we figured out the problem, and now here we go again with Q's latest entry in the most offensive song, Contest. 
[01:16:30]  A very brutal song.  We understand that.  This is bad.  This is really bad.  Okay.  All right, check it out for yourself, and then call us up and tell us what you think.  Me, you forget about it.  Imagine there's no friggin' niggas.  Imagine there ain't no friggin' jiggaboos, no bolognans, and no spooks. 
[01:17:00]  There ain't no big, scary darkies running around out there.  And of course, no friggin' Arabs, no Hindus, no spooks, and no friggin' goos.  Imagine nothing but friggin' Italians.  Every friggin' way you go.  Come on, it would be great, eh?  Imagine there's no homos. 
[01:17:30]  I ate those little fudge-packin' Nancy Boy bricks, for my honor.  Every time I see one, I want to feed them in the friggin' head, you know what I mean?  Then I'll rip his heart out, cut off his friggin' little f***.  Imagine all the panookias.  Oh, my God.  Just droppin' dead from the friggin' ass. 
[01:18:00]  You know what?  You might call me a scumbag.  But I hate those friggin' kind of people, you know what I mean?  I'm gonna go upstairs and get a friggin' shotgun.  Yeah, I know a couple of mulling out fags need to get whacked.  Imagine, there's no quirkles. 
[01:18:30]  None of those three-legged little freaks running around the floor look like friggin' chimps.  Come on, I hate those goddamn friggin' handicapped parking spaces.  Christ, I want to kill those goddamn little wheelchair chimps.  Imagine, taking all the repods, send them out on the PQE.  Gotta be a pretty side hat. 
[01:19:00]  But you know what?  You may say, I'm a scumbag.  You put me every name in the book.  I don't give a flying freak.  You know what I mean?  Because it pisses me off.  I'm gonna take a friggin' shotgun.  I'm gonna go out.  And I'm gonna whack me a couple of lesbian, midget, Mexican, overweight, fat, wheelchair bitches.  Oh, man. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  The latest entry by Q of the most offensive song.  Oh, my God.  I was tearing up a minute there.  What a touching little tune that is.  Let me tell you something.  You can hear the humor in the song.  Oh, really?  Oh, it's very offensive.  That's a little joke.  Oh, it's very...  Okay, terrific.  Oh, it's offensive. 
[01:20:00]  It's offensive, all right.  But you don't hear the hatred like the KKK song.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, let me tell you.  You definitely laugh a little bit.  The rave's coming in.  Whoa, let's go to the song.  Hey, you felt a little shaking there?  It was Lennon just doing heavy RPMs in his coffin.  Let's go right to the phones.  Gino.  Boy, I wonder if Gino liked the song.  Gino, what's up?  Hey, it's freaking hilarious.  It makes the KKK song look like a nursery rhyme.  All right, very good. 
[01:20:30]  Thank you, Gino.  All right.  All right, let's go to Pete.  Hey, Pete.  Pete, you're next on NAW.  No, we lost Pete.  Okay, let's go to Brian.  Hey, Brian, you're next on NAW.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Great show.  Hey, thanks.  Listen, I want to nominate that song as the new national anthem.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  The Yankees game.  Everybody stands out.  Bowling kiddies.  It'd be great.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Well, that was truly an offensive song.  I got to tell you.  And for the offensive song contest, what the hell? 
[01:21:00]  Hope it wins, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you.  Let's see what James has to say about the song.  James?  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey, what's up?  You're on the air, James.  Yeah, that song rules.  You like it, huh?  How do we get a copy of that?  That song should be played every minute of the day.  I don't know, man.  Every show, the end of your show, every minute of the show, that song should be played.  Man, all the Italians checking it out today.  I see.  Keep up the good work, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Donna.  Hey, Donna, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you?  Absolutely love that song.  That was hysterical.  I'm driving in my car just laughing hysterical. 
[01:21:30]  Another Italian.  Then it can't be offensive.  It can't be an offensive tune.  Everybody loves it.  No, but it is offensive because at the end, he wraps it up and just knocks everybody.  Ah, there you go.  You know, he made sure he covered all his bases.  All right.  Except for the Italians.  Well, yeah, but just look how bad it makes us look that it, you know, we use the word friggin'  as an adjective.  I know.  All right.  Thank you.  Who knows?  We don't friggin' do that.  Very good, Donna.  Okay. 
[01:22:00]  You guys are great.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Oh, George thinks the song sucks.  George?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, man?  You don't like the song?  I hate that song.  All right.  Which song would you vote for?  You've probably heard most of them.  I'm sorry.  Oh, come on what you're cursing now.  Friggin', friggin', sorry.  What song would you vote for in the most offensive song contest?  Damn, I forgot the name of it.  Well, give us a hand.  We know the songs.  Oh, man.  Welcome to camp contestation. 
[01:22:30]  No?  It's the...  The KKK, man?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  That is a brutal song.  Oh, but that one you just played really blue, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Gina.  Gina!  Yes.  I thought this was the most offensive song contest.  That song is the best.  That's not offensive.  That's beautiful.  I agree with the last guy.  It should be the national anthem.  That is not offensive.  Really?  All right.  I'm stunned.  Thank you, Gina. 
[01:23:00]  Anything coming on in the instant feedback, Anthony?  People loving, loving the song.  Yeah.  Most people...  Most people really are in favor of this song.  All right.  As number one.  As number one?  Oh, yeah.  To beat out the KKK song.  You know how it is, huh?  When you first play them, people love it.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, this is Joey Cops from Queens.  This song is Off the Hinges.  Off the Hinges, huh?  All right.  Indication now.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Take care.  Jennifer thought this song sucked.  Jennifer, what's going on?  Nothing.  That song really, really blue.  I mean, it's not too original to steal off the KKK song to go into all this racism stuff.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So you're still voting for the KKK, man?  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  It ruled.  Thank you, Jennifer.  You're welcome.  Greatest song ever played.  Let's see.  And you're not reading just the good ones because you are, indeed, yourself, Italian.  Well, me?  Yeah.  No.  No.  I'm an Italian and loved it. 
[01:24:00]  It was very offensive and it was effing great.  All right.  Holy crap.  Even more offensive than the KKK, man.  Okay.  Thank God I'm Italian.  Ding, ding, ding.  We have a frigging winner.  Oh, you ain't heard nothing yet.  That was awesome.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, guys, listen.  That song wasn't offensive at all.  That was probably the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Really?  Yeah, but on your show, if you want to become a, to make it offensive, I stopped breathing  during Baby Raper for five minutes in my car. 
[01:24:30]  I didn't take a breath.  You know, I.  Baby Raper, Baby Raper is the best.  I stopped breathing during that.  Baby Raper is getting beat by the KKK, man.  Oh, can't be.  I know.  The KKK man was great.  That was great, too.  Baby Raper, when you stop breathing during a song, you know it's offensive.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  Jim from New York City, that song rocks.  I want to be Italian.  Should be the new Sopranos theme song.  Very good.  Let's see.  A bunch of people saying that the KKK song is still in the lead, Anthony. 
[01:25:00]  Seymour.  Hey.  What's up?  Definitely KKK.  Yeah?  Yeah, definitely.  That one's kicking butt.  All right.  Did you like the new one, though?  Yeah, it's great.  I agree with the last call that it should be our national anthem.  All right.  Well, thank you.  You're very welcome.  All right.  Let's go to Tom.  Jason from the Bronx, my buddy Alfonso, who's Italian, thinks it's the best thing he's heard  in years.  He's crying.  It's so frigging beautiful.  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, Ode?  How are you?  All right. 
[01:25:30]  Listen, the KKK song is more offensive than anything.  Yeah?  The Italian song, that's just hysterical.  But not as offensive as the KKK song.  Really?  It really is a funny song.  The guy's delivery is classic.  Yeah.  You may call me a scumbag.  All right.  All right, guys.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  Syndication yesterday.  Now we got two great entries from Q.  Syndication never.  Syndication, right. 
[01:26:00]  When Manson's paroled.  Yeah, that's pretty much what's going to happen.  Glenn, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you?  Oh, baby.  You frigging suck.  That song sucked, guys.  Really?  He was, like, talking the whole time.  It was supposed to be the most offensive song.  It was offensive, but it wasn't really a song.  That's why.  I think it's between KKK and Kill a Fetus.  He wasn't even singing.  It's the second entry.  This guy bites off of something that's already been done.  That's called rap.  All right.  Yo, he was rapping, man.  He was rapping.  You may call me a scumbag. 
[01:26:30]  That's great.  You've got to love the delivery.  No matter what, man.  Let's see.  Kyle says KKK man still in the lead.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, KKK's song's so much better than that one.  That one was nothing.  It wasn't offensive at all.  Right.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Thank you.  I'm just reading.  I can't even read that one.  Thank you, bro.  Kyle.  I'm getting lots of feedback.  I can't wait, man. 
[01:27:00]  I'm getting butterflies in anticipation.  Oh, yeah.  Well, now you've got a song like that to follow.  It's going to be a little rough.  Ah, yeah.  We do have Joe in the studio, Anthony's brother.  He's got an entry for the Most Offensive Song Contest.  Yes.  And we're going to play a little after 5 o'clock here.  Okay.  Hey, hey, hello.  Yeah, it's Scanto.  I want to put that new song on British Biscuits on my show.  Can I do that? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Imagine I'm a scumbag.  Gino.  Hey, Vinny for president, and this should be his campaign song, bro.  Oh, my God.  That was awesome.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Another guy that thinks the song sucked, and then we'll move on here.  Steve, what's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Listen, I'm Jewish, and I feel offended.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was left out.  If you're Jewish, you might want to turn off the radio.  Oh, well, for all of our Jewish friends, we did say we had three new songs today. 
[01:28:00]  That was only the first one.  Hang in there, Josh.  Yeah, for our Jewish friends.  Listen, I'm a paramedic, and the other day I got caught singing Baby Raper on the ambulance.  Yeah, that's not good.  Ouch.  Yeah, no good.  That never works.  All right, Steve.  Syndication now, baby.  Thank you.  Hell, we're not diamond dust.  All right.  Time travel now.  Let's go to Vinny.  Might as well just say that.  Vinny!  Hope you're there to be.  Oh, no.  Hello, friends.  Hi, Vinny.  It's Vinny. 
[01:28:30]  I've got to say, that song goes down as a masterpiece along with the Leaning Tower of Pisa,  the statue, David, Michelangelo.  Yeah.  It's a classic.  Vinny the Racist, everybody.  Love this song.  And Sinatra, Sinatra the author, that's what I want to find out.  Did he write that piece?  It's a classic.  A very enigmatic name, just Q, who wrote that song.  I don't want to try, I don't want to say, I didn't want to bring this up, but you see 
[01:29:00]  what's going on down there in Miami, Miami, Cuba?  Yes, with Miami, Cuba.  You know, these people down there, these Cubans, have declared war on the United States.  I say we go down there with F-15s and napalm that whole damn place.  It's a disgrace what these people are calling.  Half of them, most of them are all illegal immigrants.  They come over here on boats, they should have been sunk by our submarines. 
[01:29:30]  It's a disgrace.  Really?  Yeah, really, Anthony.  And you know it's a true, Anthony.  Yeah.  Our parents came home from the old country.  They had to work.  They had to break the book.  The old country, Flushing.  Well, I mean your grandparents.  Oh, oh, oh, Harlem.  Okay.  The point I'm trying to make is this.  These scum, they come over here for freedom, and what do they do?  They attack America.  It's a disgrace. 
[01:30:00]  Let's go in there with the National Guard and wipe them all out and get the kid back  to his father.  Coming.  Okay, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Okay, terrific.  Great.  Vinny, always a pleasure.  Oh, I love you guys.  Oh, don't say that.  No, I love you.  All right.  Bye, Vinny.  I know you love me.  Hold on, because old Dirty is, oh, wow, this could be good.  Oh, Vinny, call back.  Oh, where did Vinny go?  Vinny, don't be a puss.  Call back.  We got an OD checking in. 
[01:30:30]  OD, what up?  Yo, what up, man?  What's up?  My man.  My man.  How real did he get yesterday, bro?  With the radio show?  Oh, my God.  You've been down here when it's gotten intense, but, man, yesterday I took the cake there.  You know what I'm saying?  Yo, what's up with Vinny, man?  Well, Vinny hung up.  Yeah, well, I'm enjoying myself.  You know what I'm saying?  Listening to the most offensive song, you know?  Yeah.  I liked the last one.  It was all right.  It had a little bit more comedic value, but the KKK song is still on top because it's 
[01:31:00]  more cutting edge.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's a little bit more, you know.  But, yo, what's up with Vinny, man?  I'm all the time trying to politicize something, man.  Well, you know, it is a mess down there in Miami.  Yo, but not everybody agrees with you.  You know what I'm saying?  Yo, I say send the kid back.  Hey, OD, don't your people have jobs?  Well, I don't got a job.  Who has to try to protest?  I'm not trying to make a living.  I think they get paid like $6, $7 an hour just to hold up some signs.  You see all that craziness down there in Miami, and you're like, man, what kind of bosses these 
[01:31:30]  people have?  They're allowed to take the day off to go protest.  Well, maybe they own their own businesses or something, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  That's what it is.  Entrepreneur is one of them.  Oh, my kidding, right?  Oh, my God, yeah.  They're employees of the state, yo.  It's all welfare.  You need to bring them down.  Hold on.  I had to dump out your cursing.  Yo, I did?  Yeah.  Yo, I did it?  I think you did.  I have to be safe to sound like I was talking.  Yo.  It sounded like it. 
[01:32:00]  Yo, John turned the key yesterday.  When I heard music, I said, forget it, yo.  We never thought we'd see the day where they would take the Opie and Anthony show off the  air.  They took it off.  I couldn't believe it.  It happened yesterday because we ran out of delay.  Because you know how it is when you get into a melee.  Yeah.  The F word is thrown around like nothing.  Yeah.  And that took up all our delay.  Yo, I thought Jay Moore threw fat guy.  You know the room, you know, like in the lobby, you know the room with all the amplifiers  and all that?  You know, every time I go there, I'm like, yo, you know, you got to hook me up with one 
[01:32:30]  of the Fs.  I thought Jay Moore pushed the fat guy into that room and blew up the station, yo.  Yeah.  How weird was it when all of a sudden you're hearing a great fight and the next thing you  know, you hear, ain't he talking about love?  Yo, I'm like spaghetti, yo.  Somebody died.  Yeah.  You know, I had to check in periodically.  You know, I wanted to hear what was going on.  I'm running in and out of this lady's house.  I come out and I hear this song.  I'm like, uh-oh.  Yeah.  That's never good.  Yo, so Billy's an amigo, man? 
[01:33:00]  Ah, he just-  He cut himself out of the mix, right?  I don't know.  He just dug his own grave.  Yeah, because yo, he had-  All right, yo.  He had a legitimate-  He had a legitimate beef, you know what I'm saying?  Even though that Friday, you know?  Yeah.  I kind of agree with a little that what he was saying, you know what I'm saying?  But then afterwards, yo, instead of carrying on, you know, a good conversation and iron everything  out, yo, he flipped, you know?  He did flip.  He just flipped, man.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  And he was cool people, bro.  He was all right, man.  Well, that's kind of-  So what are you going to do, bro?  That's kind of sad.  Yo, where's Vinny, man?  I'm stalling, but it looks like Vinny can't get through on the phone line.  Yeah, we're going to hear Anthony.  We came from the home country.  We had to work, you know?  Come on, man.  All right, OG.  Well, thank you.  Yes, sir.  You're welcome.  All right, we got to take a break.  On the way next is Anthony's brother, Joe's entry in the most offensive song contest.  Hmm. 
[01:34:00]  Opie and Anthony will give a hot new SUV to their most dedicated fanatical listeners.  Details coming soon from Opie and Anthony.  1027 WMEW.  Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  Oh, Opie, I love Rockaway Bedding.  I sleep in a Rockaway Bedding bed.  Yes, you do, Anthony.  It's big and soft.  And it's a name brand, Stearns and Foster.  They got like 130 stores in New York, New Jersey.  They have stores all over the place.  Every time I'm driving, I see a Rockaway Bedding store.  Yeah, and it's easy.  You could pop in there and try out their beds. 
[01:34:30]  Their helpful sales staff will help you find a bed that's perfect for you.  And you save like 65% below department store regular prices.  And then they deliver your mattress to your house, wherever the hell you want it delivered.  And then they get rid of your old mattress.

And that, a better night's sleep is your most important reason for your new mattress purchase. 
[01:35:00]  Opie, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Thank you.  All right, now you can finish the spot.  Shop at one of Rockaway Bedding's area stores or call 1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Rockaway Bedding, the best and friendliest place to get your new brand name mattress with the best prices and friendliest staff, aren't they?  They didn't hit me once when I went in there.  Rockaway Bedding, the official provider of mattresses for me, Anthony, and Jay Moore, Hollywood outlaw.  Mike's punching fat guy.  All right, give them a call.  It's Rockaway Bedding, 1-800-TRY-A-BED. 
[01:35:30]  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me blow chucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and that ain't my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie and Anthony.  What a couple of ass-wives.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Sitting in cowbell bell.  Hey!  And Anthony's brother, Joe, who's contributed a lot of stuff to this fine radio show and never 
[01:36:00]  complained.  Oh, oh, oh, do you acknowledge me?  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll get Jay Moore in here to beat you up.  That's right.  I had him around the waist in the studio, man.  I looked across body blocks going on the guy when he was running that fast.  But in all seriousness, Joe has contributed more to this show than Billy and Paul put together 
[01:36:30]  and has never said a word.  Yeah.  I know.  Never needed his time in the spotlight or anything.  Well, not in front of you guys, anyway.  Yeah.  He sits like a mother behind our backs.  Oh, you should see what I hear.  I can only imagine.  All right.  A lot of reaction coming in from the latest entry in the most offensive song contest, Anthony.  Yes.  The Q song, getting lots of reaction on the phone lines.  Carl, what's up?  Funny as hell, but it was not offensive. 
[01:37:00]  Was not offensive?  Not even close.  Well, it was veiled in comedy.  Yeah, veiled in comedy, but that's not what the contest is about.  I'm just saying it was very offensive, though.  Look at what he's saying.  It's not as funny as hell, but that's not the most offensive.  So, it's offensive, but not the most offensive song.  All right.  I put it this way.  As a black guy, come on.  It didn't bother me.  Baby raper rules.  Baby raper you like, huh?  Oh, hands down.  Original music, original lyrics, offensive.  That's what you're looking for. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Well, it's going to be up to you guys in the end there.  So, right now, it looks like the KKK man is in the lead.  Yeah, it was good.  It was good.  We have another week or so left in the contest as far as getting your entries in.  So, we'll see what we find in the mail in the coming days.  Okay.  All right, Carl.  Okay.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's go to Jonathan, a black guy.  It says it on the screen.  Jonathan, what's going on?  I just heard that song.  Yeah.  Made me laugh because not only did he make fun of the black guys, he made fun of everybody. 
[01:38:00]  That's right.  But he just made fun of everybody just so he could get in making fun of the black guys.  Well, I was actually torn between Camp Concentration and the KKK song.  Yeah.  But I like this one.  I think you should go with this one as your winner.  He's not black.  You sure you're black, Jonathan?  Well, let's put it this way.  Yeah.  As I tell my Uncle Tom, you're putting me next to three white guys.  Trust me, the client won't have to rock with me.  I was expecting to hear your lips sound like two kickballs having a head on collision. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's going to ring the bell.  Come on.  Cowbell bell.  Wow.  Oh, man.  What the hell is that about?  Jonathan.  Two kickballs.  Jonathan, I personally apologize to you.  You're a freaking retard, man.  Guys, I was one of six black kids in an all-white Catholic school.  I think I've just about heard it all.  I apologize to you.  You have never heard two kickballs in a head on competition. 
[01:39:00]  That is a little weird.  You have too much time on your hand, Cowbell Bell.  Come up with stuff like that.  All right, Jonathan.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Valerie.  Valerie.  Hello.  Hi.  I'm still dying over that last one.  The Q song.  I think that song really blows.  You sound like a tired Andrew Dice Clay over there.  Yeah.  It doesn't compare to KKK.  Hey, that's redundant.  It really is.  A tired Andrew Dice Clay. 
[01:39:30]  And not only that, wait, come on.  He wasn't making it with his own song.  He had to go steal another theme.  That's not fair.  One entry per person.  That's it.  New rules.  No, because we're getting our best entries from the people that are sending in more than  one.  I think Fuel has like ten songs in the contest.  Oh, really?  Q's up to two.  Joe has a few in by the end of the day.  By the way, I have nothing to do with those.  Yeah, Bill.  Oh, after that line, Bill?  Thank you, Valerie.  I don't think there's anything in either of those songs worse than what you just said  in about two seconds. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, keep these shorts on.  Ash, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  Great.  Valerie's totally wrong.  Those guys can give you a hundred entries.  Oh, really?  The song is a riot.  I almost drove my butt off the road listening to that song.  Which one?  The one done to John Lennon, Imagine?  Yeah, Imagine.  It's hysterical.  All right.  And it's funny and outrageous and offensive.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay. 
[01:40:30]  I think it might be in contention, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think so.  It's holding its own right now.  Hey, Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Open Ant?  How are you?  All right.  How are you guys?  Good.  I'm telling you, baby raper, most offensive.  People love that baby raper song.  I'm with you.  I think that by far is the most offensive song, but it's losing in the voting right now.  It's the KKK, man.  It was so messed up, and Anthony was going so along with it and how demented it was.  Yeah.  It was just, you know, not only baby raping in the song, it was eating babies, how delicious 
[01:41:00]  they were.  I know.  That threw it over.  It was just, that was it, man.  All right.  See you.  Thank you, Kevin.  See you.  One more call, and we'll get to Joe's entry.  John, what's up?  What's up?  What's up, baby?  What's up, baby?  Two-week listeners, seven-time caller.  Huh?  Two-week listeners, seven-time caller.  Show us how many listeners we have.  I taped that song, and I'm going to be listening to it while I eat my spaghetti meatballs tonight.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Very good.  Peace.  All right, peace. 
[01:41:30]  Peace out.  We always take one.  One too many.  Which one are you guys doing first?  Well, we'll probably do the, well, let me point.  Okay.  Are you going to acknowledge that you wrote this song?  Yes.  Okay.  Will you acknowledge that you wrote this song?  I'll tell you why.  Yes.  I'll acknowledge that I wrote it.  Yeah.  But the standard disclaimer.  Oh, really?  The standard disclaimer, yeah.  All right.  I mean, you know. 
[01:42:00]  And this just in, Zeke from Jersey.  Q is the Weird Al Yankovic of offensive material.  That's pretty good.  All right.  I don't know.  Anthony, when Anthony told me that I was permitted to send in a couple of entries.  Yeah, we have no contest rules like the employees and relatives.  But when he told me, I just pulled out all the stops.  He gave me a mission, and I'll complete it.  Yeah.  We don't even know what the winner is going to get, so.  No.  Yeah, we don't have any prize or anything. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Probably get the opportunity to write a few more parodies for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I win.  I win anyway.  All right.  Well, let's play Joe's entry.  All right.  Which one are we going to start with?  The one he wrote?  I think you should start with Pearl Jam Necklace.  Pearl Jam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A song called, oh, God.  Just play it.  This contest is just getting painful.  All right.  Here's Anthony's brother, Joe. 
[01:43:00]  His entry in the most offensive song contest.  Right.  Self-explanatory.  Self-explanatory.  My phone gets restless, so I violate my little girl's tender.  A young girl, five or six, definitely creep you better, while her mother sleeps. 
[01:43:30]  I know it's kind of underhanded.  She gets me around, so I stopped in and stroked her head with my toes, then pulled down her under rules. 
[01:44:00]  Just on my top, it felt good.  It says it's best, it's all right with me.  Just on my top, it felt good.  It says it's best, it feels fine to me.  Just on my top, it's all right with me.  Okay, terrific.  Version. 
[01:44:30]  Version.  Okay, terrific.  It says it's best, it's all right with me. 
[01:45:00]  It says it's all right with me.  Just on my top, it feels good.  It says it's best, it feels fine to me.  Just on my top, it says it's all right with me.  Oh, my Lord. 
[01:45:30]  Watch, it finishes just like a real thing.  Oh, yeah, just like it.  Yeah, listen.  Oh, yeah, that'll put it right over the top, the end.  Oh, wow.  Well, the review is coming in on the instant feedback. 
[01:46:00]  Eddie Vedder, eat your heart out.  Joe should make a video and send it to the B'nai Ramsey family.  James on line eight says that you're ripping off Baby Raper.  Oh.  James, what's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hi.  Yeah, not exactly a rip-off.  The song's okay.  Don't misunderstand me.  But to me, all the songs in the contest are just copies of themselves.  KKK Man and the last one, they're pretty close.  This one and Baby Raper are pretty close.  I mean, there needs to be a little more originality here.  I put a subtle twist on it. 
[01:46:30]  Instead of just any baby, it's your daughter, you see.  That's the difference.  It's incest, man.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Look at him justifying his song.  Thank you, James.  Yeah, hold on, guys.  I just wanted to thank you.  I won the tickets yesterday.  Oh, cool.  Congratulations.  Okay, thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  Okay, horrific.  Just found a winner.  Rob, Rob, what's going on?  I definitely think you guys just found a winner.  I'm on my way to the YMCA to pick up my six-year-old. 
[01:47:00]  And I'm listening to this song, and I'm like, my lord, this is a sick bastard.  I'll pick her up.  And if I was you, you know, just deny the whole DNA thing.  He's not really your brother.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  You guys are great.  You guys suck.  Well, Tom on line four says the guy singing is more offensive.  Let's go to Simon.  Simon, what's up?  I almost threw up driving down the road.  Oh, yeah.  That is a wonderful song. 
[01:47:30]  That one wins, hands down.  I don't think I can handle this contest anymore.  The adulation.  Oh, my God.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you, Simon.  We have Fox News on the line.  We've got to get to them in a second here.  Oh, we do?  Jeff, what's up?  This song wins.  Really?  This song out.  Underoos?  Yes.  Very clever use of the Underoos joke.  Very good job.  Good description.  Thank you.  Who rhymes Underoos in a song?  Joe.  Thank you, Jeff. 
[01:48:00]  Over and out, Simon, Dustin.  All right.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  Let me wipe my mouth.  I just got them puking.  Hold on.  You guys, I'll tell you.  I drive a rig for a living, and I go all over the country, and it's good to get back here  to listen to you guys, because you guys rock.  I'll tell you what.  I haven't heard the last couple ones except for today, and that is by far the worst thing  I've ever heard in my life.  Wow.  All right. 
[01:48:30]  If it's the criteria, it's the most expensive song.  That's got to be a winner by far.  Thank you, Bob.  You guys rock.  All right.  Let's go to Andrew.  Tell the Fox guy.  We'll get to him in a second.  Andrew, what's up?  That is the worst thing I have ever heard in my life.  That one's just like Bay Raper, except it's got to be at least ten times worse.  All right.  I just want to let you guys know, anyone out there who wants to take my title for a song  called, I see I'm not really good with lyrics or anything, called God is a Fag. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, wow.  Well, that's one angle that hasn't really been tackled.  How about that?  All right.  Over and out.  Diamond Dust.  Thank you, Andrew.  All right, Ant, let's, our interviews with the media continue.  Yeah, what is this about?  It's about the Jay Moore fight.  Yeah.  And on the line, I believe we have Kevin from Fox News.  Kevin.  What it is, O&A.  Hey.  How are you, Kevin?  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  Hey, jeez.  I don't know if I can have kids.  That was pretty bad.  Oh, my God.  I'd like to thank everybody for calling in and also thank my wife and my three daughters. 
[01:49:30]  Oh.  I've got to tell you, my brother.  Brother Joe was adopted, so it has nothing to do with the family bloodline or anything.  And for the love of God, do not talk about that on Fox News.  Oh, no, no, no.  Let's get to the reason why you called.  Yeah, we were calling because I was listening to the show the other day.  I was supposed to go out running.  I was sitting there like for an hour and a half glued to the radio.  I'm like, who's dead?  I couldn't believe it.  It was great.  That had to be 30, 40 minutes of the best radio I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:50:00]  Thank you.  So I went and I told my producer about it and he was like, yeah, let's see if we can  get some tape.  So I called up to see if you guys had any video or audio of the brawl that you could  send us.  Oh.  Video.  Yeah.  Well, we just might have some video.  This, of course, is Jay Moore, the actor who will be starring in a movie with Kevin Spacey,  Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey.  Don't forget Helen Hunt and the little kid from Sixth Sense.  Right.  Now, will there be a love scene with Kevin Spacey and Jay Moore, though, is the question. 
[01:50:30]  On camera or off?  Exactly right.  I got to tell you, Jay Moore has been in, he's been to the Fox News studio for a morning  show with a bunch of the guys there, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade.  Yeah.  And Brian, I think, I think it was Brian challenged him to a wrestling match because he said,  hey, Jay, I hear you wrestle.  And Jay's like, yeah.  The two of them went at it.  And Jay, Jay's fast.  I've seen him fight.  He's really good.  I was like, I didn't buy anything Billy was saying the other day about laying a glove  on him.  Yeah.  It was scary. 
[01:51:00]  I had a wrestling match with Jay at one point in this studio and he just like wrapped me  up.  I was done.  It lasted three seconds.  Oy.  As a pro, he takes his money and goes to the high school he used to go to and buys  some mats.  Yeah.  And stands around.  I think it's just so we can watch young boys touch each other.  It could be that.  But, you know, it sounds noble.  It's a piece from action, you know.  That has something to do with it, I'm sure.  By the way, Kevin, before we go any further.  We want to thank you for being good sports about the whole wow thing.  You're the only TV station that has been good sports about getting wowed. 
[01:51:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because I think there's no, if you're going to do stuff like that, it's going to be on  camera.  It's funny.  I mean, Fox has always been that way anyway.  We're not like a lot of the other networks where everyone's kind of stodgy and you get  shoved off the air by like a producer or something that's on the scene.  Yeah.  You know.  A lot of the other TV stations so uptight, they have the reporters on top of the live trucks  now so no one can get to them.  Well, you know, NBC just sends Al Roker out there and they just sit on him.  Yeah.  He blocks the view so you don't know if there's any wow signs behind him. 
[01:52:00]  Exactly.  Hey, so what tape do we got?  We got tape, right?  Yeah, we have lots of tape.  Hmm.  We have good tape.  Can you send it to us?  Is that cool?  Like, that's, I guess, the question.  Well, we're waiting for Access Hollywood to call us back.  Oh, Access Hollywood.  All right, well.  Access Hollywood.  We'll go lunch.  There you go.  But, yeah, we thought it was great, though.  So I told my producer, his name is Rick as well, and he's, you know, you guys want to  get in touch with him about hooking up or something like that because. 
[01:52:30]  Called it.  Actually, you had to dump out of that.  Oh, couldn't say that name.  That's right.  Forgot about that.  We are in so much trouble.  Sorry, fellas.  That name's not allowed to be in our show anymore.  The amount of trouble we are in.  I got you.  And our listeners.  Hey, look, we just got a memo.  Yeah, okay.  Actually, the memo, I just hit the dumb button and a memo fell into my hand.  We are not allowed to.  F with that situation. 
[01:53:00]  Jesus Christ.  I won't even ask about it.  Forget it.  Eh, off the air.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Yeah, so, yeah, we could hook you up, Cap.  Yeah, Rick will get Rick's number.  That's right.  You're Rick.  You're.  And we'll hook something up.  All right.  When are you guys planning on doing something with us?  We're publicity whores, so we wouldn't mind.  Well, it's one of those things where, I mean, I'm hearing it, so I make a pitch, and then  they take it and run with it from there.  I just think that you guys are great, and so it's worth doing a story as far as I'm concerned.  Oh, cool.  Thanks. 
[01:53:30]  You know?  All right, hold down the line.  Let's have Rick talk to you.  All right.  We'll see what we can work out.  Okay, you guys are great.  Thanks.  There's Kevin from Fox News, everyone.  Yes.  We love Fox.  Not an enemy of the show.  No.  No, they take the wowing very well.  Like that NBC show, which is the one that was the really stuffy.  Who was that?  No, ABC.  Was that ABC?  Yeah.  Good Morning America.  Good Morning America.  Oh.  Yeah, they absolutely hate us.  A bunch of uptight people.  Fox has all those cool shows, too.  All those, like, caught on tape things. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  When comics attack.  You hear what Fox is working on?  Still trying to do?  They want to take a 747, get a couple of pilots in there, and then they're going to jump out  and crash this thing into the desert.  Oh, cool.  Take a 747 crashing into the desert with cameras on the inside, on the outside, chase planes.  But they're having a problem with the FAA because you're not, you can't just say,  hey, I want to crash a huge passenger plane into the desert.  So they're trying to do some kind of ruse where they're saying it's to research structural 
[01:54:30]  integrity of the, what, the desert floor?  I think we all know what's going to happen to this thing when it hits the ground.  Forget about it.  It's going to go paint Stewart.  What's going to happen to it?  Yeah, what happens if they jump out?  All right, you put it in a dime, didn't you?  No.  Where's it going?  L.A.  Oh, right.  Maybe we'll put our own spaz right there and see passenger 57.  We'll strap them in. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, can I get a cocktail?  Flight test dummy.  Flight test dummy.  Knowing him, he'd walk away from the wreckage.  Okay.  Where's my luggage?  Hey, spaz, you working on the Week in Review?  Yes, I am.  All right.  I forgot about that.  Friday, spaz's Week in Review on the O&A show.  Stacey, what's up?  Oh, no, that song.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, now we're back to Joe's song.  Now, all these songs make them laugh.  I play them to torture my mother.  Yeah.  I have a four-year-old, and the whole thing I'm driving, all I could think is, number one, 
[01:55:30]  where do I pull over to puke?  Number two, let me get home before my husband sees my daughter.  And number three, don't ever let that man have kids.  Yeah.  Because, oh, my God, he's going to go to jail before his wife gets hurt.  Oh, this man won't have kids, don't worry about it.  Don't ever let him.  That's disgusting.  All right, thank you so much.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  You should see what he does to mine.  Oh, man, I babysat Phil's kids one time.  Oh, really?  That's a whole other story.  Wow.  All right, listen. 
[01:56:00]  Are we going to get into the next song, the next entry in the most offensive song contest?  Yes.  It's also a twofer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Possibly.  Possibly a twofer.  This guy might sound like Joe.  Okay, wait a minute.  I think on the way in, Joe found this CD laying on the side of the road, didn't you?  And it just turned out to be an offensive song.  Now, this was, first of all, the idea was planted in my head by Jim, a kid that I work with.  Yeah, sure.  He planted the idea in my head, and I ran with it.  I was only following order. 
[01:56:30]  Pretty much.  All right, let's take a quick break, and we'll play another entry in the most offensive song contest.  Wait till you get a load of this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is a special one.  Mrs. Edelbaum, now would be a good time to turn off your radio.  Hey, new.  1027 WNEW's new nighttime lineup.  Pretty cool.  It starts after Opie and Anthony at 7 with the Don and Mike show.  Then at 11, check out two smartasses surfing the web.  Most amusing.  Ronandfez.com. 
[01:57:00]  Right now on 1027 WNEW.  Ah, yes, Anthony.  Yeah, look at this.  We've got to welcome a brand new sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show.  Car Cash.  We're talking about Car Cash.  Yes.  This is a great idea.  These guys, you know, selling a car is a pain in the ass.  It really is.  You've got to take an ad on the paper, and then you don't know who's coming to your house.  It could take months, years to sell your car. 
[01:57:30]  Car Cash.  They offer you top dollar for your cars.  Don't even think of selling your car or trading it in before you check with the great people at Car Cash.  Top dollar for your car.  They'll buy any kind of car.  New cars or fancy cars, vans, 4x4s, sport utility vehicles.  If you can drive it, Car Cash will buy it.  This is the way to do it.  They even buy leased or financed cars.  Isn't that great?  That is very great.  Drive-in takes about 20 minutes.  You could have an ad.  We've all tried to sell cars in the paper. 
[01:58:00]  It is.  It is a big hassle.  It takes too long.  It's a big pain.  And then people get your phone number.  They're calling at all hours.  20 minutes with Car Cash.  You drive in.  They take care of it.  All the paperwork.  Everything.  So if you've got a car that needs to be sold, what are you waiting for?  Or visit Car Cash on the web at www.carcash.com or stop by Car Cash on West 55th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues in Manhattan.  Right, Anthony?  That's right.  Give them a call.  1-800-CAR-CASH and they'll give you a free appraisal for your car right over the phone. 
[01:58:30]  Easy.  Car Cash.  That number once again.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  Once again, let's welcome Car Cash to the OV.  And Anthony, yo!  1-800-CAR-CASH.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about?  Dopey and Anthony show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  All right, we're back. 
[01:59:00]  By the way, it is Whip from El Wednesday, but it's still early before we start really talking about that.  Right, Anthony?  You know, it blows, too.  I'll tell you, we get back from L.A. the other day.  It was like 85 degrees out there.  I was on the beach, and I'm thinking, okay, it's April.  It's shaping up here in New York also.  I walked out the door today, and winter's back.  A little chill in the air.  A little nip.  Well, we'll get into the warm weather soon. 
[01:59:30]  We've got the brand-new WOW stickers on the way.  They're being printed as we speak.  If you send a self-addressed stamped envelope, you can be one of the first on your block to own the new WOW sticker, Anthony.  Yes, that address is WOW sticker, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, I believe.  Look at you.  Not bad, huh?  Rises courtesy of Spiegel Kettlebell. 
[02:00:00]  Spiegel.  Jay, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  That song was disgusting.  Get titillated.  Ah, come on.  This could be the most offensive phone call we've ever had.  Yeah, I hung up on him.  You're disgusting.  That song was very disturbing, Anthony.  Yeah.  One guy wants to lock you up, Joe, for that last song.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  All right, I guess we could get into the next entry.  Yes.  This one taking a little different tack. 
[02:00:30]  We've noticed a lot of songs about ethnic backgrounds.  Anthony, do you have a sister-in-law?  Oh, let's see.  Anthony's sister-in-law.  That would be Colleen.  If it's...  Oh, yeah, okay.  Joe's...  She could have just said Joe's wife.  All right, let's go to the phone here.  Hello?  Hi.  Hey.  I did say Joe's wife.  Hi, honey.  You must be...  I'm not going to be any longer, not after that song.  Oh, Joe, let me start telling you about it. 
[02:01:00]  It's very expensive.  I'm getting all of his stuff out on the front lawn.  I did it down in the dungeon.  She didn't hear it.  Chasing the locks.  Oh, the locks are a good thing to change, but then he could just break through the door  and get his computer equipment.  I got two killer little dogs over here.  Do it, Colleen.  His breath smells like brownies.  Oh, John.  Oh, John.  You guys.  How can I face my family after that song?  Oh, just wait until the next one.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  This is good.  Oh, God.  You want to be able to drive near a synagogue after this next one.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to turn off the radio now.  That's a good idea.  All right.  Okay.  I love you, Colleen.  I'll see you later.  Tell your friends.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  My lovely wife, Colleen.  There you go.  Speaking of facing the family.  Yeah.  Right after the show tonight, I'm going to my brother's place, Baxter's Grill, Port Washington.  Yeah.  For my grandma's 90th birthday.  My whole family's going to be there. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  I know.  I know.  Just don't bring up any of this crap.  Is she going to be dressed in, like, a prom dress?  Is it going to be a cute grandma dress?  No, my grandma's still happening, man.  Is she?  Yeah.  At 85.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you just saying that?  Because there are people that are like, no.  Grandma's 90, and she's got all her marbles, and she's great.  Look at grandma sitting there, and I look at the grandma, and she's drooling.  You know, there are certain grandmas that are still very up and alert, and there are some  that, let's put it this way. 
[02:02:30]  My grandma, who's 90, has a sister that is going to be 96.  They still go to Atlantic City to gamble.  Sweet.  Okay.  I swear to you.  Does she go?  My God.  And I'm breaking out that Mets stuff in a second.  I meant on the bus.  She'd go on the bus to Atlantic City.  Yeah, she goes on the bus to Atlantic City to gamble.  God, look at you.  You ready to go?  Wow, she goes on the bus.  I'm ready to go.  And the amount of day, the instrument of death in her belly, bombs of Tokyo. 
[02:03:00]  I'll break out that Mets bed so fast.  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  It's like an arms race around here.  I didn't say anything.  So, I know the whole family's going to be there.  They're going to look at me and say, you're sick and twisted and demented.  We all know that.  So, let's not even talk about it tonight.  I hate going to these functions because they all look at me like, what?  You can always bring us and take the attention away from you.  Yeah, Joe will perform a song live.  There you go.  Hey, how old is she?  She's going to be, she's 90 today, right?  Yeah, 90 today. 
[02:03:30]  I've got to wish her happy birthday to Buddy Ebsen yesterday.  92, I believe.  92.  Yesterday.  My grandma's in much better shape than Buddy Ebsen.  Yeah.  Should we play the Well Doggies?  Do you have it over there?  I don't think I have my Well Doggie.  Oh, crap.  I've got to get the Well Doggie on this one.  Here's the most recent Well Doggie we have like a year ago when he was 91.  Yeah.  He didn't sound too good.  Here he is.  Well Doggies.  Use it or lose it.  Use it or lose it.  Well Doggies.  He doesn't sound like a guy. 
[02:04:00]  Jed, you don't sound too good, Jed.  Well Doggie.  We've got to call Buddy soon.  Yeah.  Granny Uncle Jed fell in the cement pond.  Well Doggie.  He sounds like a 14-4 modem, doesn't he?  He does.  Remember the handshake of a 14-4?  Yeah, he signed on to America Online.  Well Doggie.  Well Doggie. 
[02:04:30]  Well Doggie.  Oh, and I...  Well.  Well.  I just hooked on to the mainframe of the CIA.  And I do have my Well Doggie.  Oh, good.  My Well Doggie is when Buddy Epson turned 90.  90.  Here's Buddy at 90.  Well Doggie.  Wow.  That's the Well Doggie we all know and love.  Let's hear that again.  Smooth.  On his 90th birthday, more or less. 
[02:05:00]  Buddy Epson.  Well Doggie.  Yeah.  And last year.  Well Doggie.  We've got to call him and get it from this year.  We've got to get this year.  I've got to hear what he's up.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rick.  It sounded like he was doing shots of Drano in between those birthdays.  And here...  Oh, I think we have from this year.  Here it is.  If someone gets my book bag, I've got Buddy Epson's home number in my book bag, we can  call him and get a brand new Well Doggie. 
[02:05:30]  We have...  Oh, I'd love to talk to Buddy.  Really?  We have the Well Doggie from his 90th birthday.  Well Doggie.  And last year at 91.  Well Doggie.  We've got to get the third one.  We've got to get the third one.  I have the number.  They're running down to get the number, so...  Come on, Buddy.  We'll try to do that a little later this hour, I guess.  Yeah.  All right, but in the meantime, Anthony, I believe it's time for another entry in the  Most Defensive Song Contest. 
[02:06:00]  Yes.  I don't know what else to say about this contest, but...  I would say oy vey to this one.  The opinions expressed in this next song do not necessarily reflect the views...  Yeah.  You know what I'm trying to say.  This radio station, the opening of this show...  Or Joe.  Or Cowbell Bill.  Or Brother Joe or Cowbell Bill.  You wrote it.  Oh, man.  I had nothing to do with this one.  Yeah.  See what happens just before these songs are played?  Only because...  Everyone is like...  Yeah, but it's because...  Even the listeners are like, should I listen to this one? 
[02:06:30]  The most offensive song.  Right.  This one, as far as I was concerned, I go for the jugular.  If I do something, I go for the jugular.  I go 100% or I don't go at all, right?  This one went for the jugular.  If you thought the last one was offensive, it was nothing compared to this.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Yeah.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Okay.  Okay.  I just get that uncomfortable feeling every time we have to play this song. 
[02:07:00]  I know.  Play a song.  It's just...  My bungles, Padre.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Is there anything you could say to make it a little smoother?  All I can say is we have said in the past, this is the most offensive song contest,  so what?  How can a song be too offensive for the most offensive song contest?  Let it ride.  That's it.  What's the name of this one?  Wait till you get a load of this.  It's called...  It's called...  Mein Fuhrer.  Oh, Mein Fuhrer.  Oh, Mein Fuhrer.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry. 
[02:07:30]  It's a historical piece.  It's some music right off the history.  It was either Incest or the Holocaust, and I did one on both of them.  How about Incest in the Holocaust?  There's an idea.  Now, you see, I could have gone that route.  Oh, that would have been offensive.  All right.  Here's the latest entry in the most offensive song contest.  Can't wait for this one.  Great.  Here we go.  Eins, zwei, drei, vier.  Okay, good.  Oh, Mein Fuhrer.  Build some ovens just to cook up Jews. 
[02:08:00]  We sweep them down and gas them good.  Sold their clothes and shoes.  With a big team here and a royal timey there.  Here a kike, there a Jew.  Everywhere a dead Jew.  Oh, Mein Fuhrer.  Build some ovens just to cook up Jews.  Oh, Mein Fuhrer.  Wanted lampshade made of evil skin.  We peel it off and hang to dry before we throw them in.  With an apple here and a navel there. 
[02:08:30]  Don't you skin this too much hair.  Okay, okay, I can't take it anymore.  Wanted lampshade made of evil skin.  Oh, Mein Fuhrer.  Why did you not cook choksters and speaks?  Oh, my God.  Every mongrels get their brazy meeks and wops and chinks.  With an hot tongue here and a cigar there.  Here a Jew, there a Jew.  Every minute.  I'm not laughing. 
[02:09:00]  For a bad purity in police.  Just to cook some Jews.  Dungership.  Oh, my God.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  I had a job to do.  I had a job to do.  Dive, dive, dive.  There's some guy from the JDL down there asking for me.  I don't know if I should do it yet.  Let the record state that Opie did not laugh during that song. 
[02:09:30]  Okay, terrific.  Oh, my God.  Why couldn't we have...  Look, man.  I was given the job to do, and I did it.  Why couldn't we have the Buddy Epson phone number ready to go?  Oh, my God.  Well, I'll tell you something.  Could be the most offensive song I've ever heard in my life.  Could be the most offensive song.  David.  It fits all the criteria.  David.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Guys, that's it.  That is the worst thing you have ever done.  That is it.  My grandparents, who actually got toasted in those ovens, are rolling in their graves. 
[02:10:00]  This is disgusting.  That is the worst song.  This is it.  Please, stop.  You know, when I was singing Baby Raper at work and they told my wife about it, that  was bad.  But this is awful.  For the love of God, we've got to stop the contest.  I cannot.  Don't bring God into it, man.  He ain't laughing this time.  Someone's amazed that Joe was able to write a twisted Hitler polka song.  I mean.  He's going to get the 15th level of hell for this one, my friend. 
[02:10:30]  All right, David.  Thank you.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  You guys suck.  Syndication forever.  Yeah.  That's how long it'll take.  Oh, my God.  What have I done?  Yes.  Andrew.  Yes.  Hey, Andrew.  Guys, I'm Jewish and I'm Cuban.  Oh, no.  Between this one and John, Cuban John, I'm about ready to go in there and pull a combine  up and up and hit.  So you're Cubish.  Yes, I am.  I'm very Cubish.  Once again, guys, I want to encourage anyone to write this song, God is a fag. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Now, let me tell you, I understand a lot of people are angry, but it is the most offensive  song contest.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You can't read half of them, can you?  See, I also played the numbers.  Now, there's a very high Jewish population in New York City, so I figured the more people  you offend... 
[02:11:30]  All right, Joe, I think we'll just turn your mic off.  You've done enough damage.  Nothing will ever compare...  I don't want to talk anymore.  Nothing will ever compare to that Hitler song.  Okay.  Done.  That's what it says.  I've done my job.  Hands down winner.  Take some more calls, man.  You've got a winner.  That song is absolutely sick.  This was horrible.  Alex, what's up?  I am shocked.  I'm disgusted. 
[02:12:00]  I can't...  I'm speechless.  That has to be the worst song I've ever heard.  Yeah.  I'm learning about the Holocaust in school right now.  That taught me more in...  How long was the song?  30 seconds?  More in 30 seconds than I've learned in 12 years of Hebrew school education.  Joe, you're worse than Hitler.  I'm sorry, man.  Joe, worse than Hitler.  You can bring it in for show and tell.  Oh, my God.  And, uh-oh.  What?  Is that the author of Camp Concentration calling in saying that Joe ripped him off?  Oh, no. 
[02:12:30]  He's got to concede.  Gil, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Gil.  I just wanted to say I like that song better when it was called Camp Concentration.  Oh, look at a little rivalry going on here.  And you made me wait like 10 seconds to get on hold.  I can't...  I just can't do that.  Hey, man, you want to fight?  Come on down.  I feel pretty funny.  No, I was going to come down today.  But, you know, I didn't want to get another fight, two fights, two days.  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's kind of hard to write a Holocaust song without using some of those catchphrases. 
[02:13:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I feel like we need to go somewhere else with this thing now.  Yeah, I understand.  We're raping babies about a dozen now.  I got to agree with you.  Okay, terrific.  Contest over.  Did you guys get the last couple I sent in?  I don't even know.  Probably.  I sent you one about digging up Jesus.  Oh, man.  Because my theory is, if you're going to go through all the trouble to dig up Jesus,  you may as well have sex with the bottom.  Listen, listen, listen. 
[02:13:30]  You're the winner.  No, I'm offended now.  Without ever writing the tune.  Now I'm offended.  Oh, my God.  This contest is over.  We can't go on with this contest.  I didn't think it would mutate into what it has.  I thought it would be a fun little contest.  We'll touch on some offensive songs.  But, James, what's up?  You asked me from earlier, guys.  Yeah.  Hi, old Joe.  Huh?  Holy God.  Guys, when's the road show? 
[02:14:00]  When's the road show?  I need this to end.  I can't take this anymore.  Hi, old Joe.  This is it, man.  It's painful.  Like, you're sitting in your car and you're thinking, should I listen to the next entry?  It's just, I'm sweating over here.  I can't take this anymore.  I was playing basketball outside.  I swear, when I heard the first lines, the ball traveled about a mile away.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay, for now, guys.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Mike, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up?  Mike.  Yeah, I think that song's great. 
[02:14:30]  Great.  The phone lines must be going nuts with all the Jews complaining.  And that's all they ever do.  Well, look at this song.  It was horrible.  Yeah, boo.  Oh, I didn't mean to hang up on him.  What do you want him to do?  Mike, you still there?  Mike?  Yeah.  All right, you still there?  Go ahead.  It was 50 years ago.  What are they still complaining about?  Oh, boy.  Now you will hang up on him.  Yeah, I get it.  They're goofing on his great Uncle Adolf, you know?  Oh.  Adolf Hitler checking in, saying even I was offended by that. 
[02:15:00]  We have a winner.  Joe, what's up?  Joe, all right.  Joe, Joe, you're going to hell in a handbasket.  The song rules.  But it was great.  And I got another question.  Back to the first song, the one's about the niggers and stuff.  If all niggers and Jews, you know, died and fell off the face of the earth, would it affect your ratings?  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  I thought this would be fun and bring everyone together, an offensive song contest.  You know, we could bring up these dated stereotypes and have a little fun with each other. 
[02:15:30]  But I'm seeing a lot of hatred here, Opie.  Right out of my own brother.  My God.  No, no, no, no, no.  I was given a job to do, and I did it.  It seems to be working.  That's all.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Mo, what's going on?  Guys, I'm Jewish, and, yeah, I was offended, but I also laughed my ass off.  The voice is so friggin' funny.  See?  That's your winner right there. 
[02:16:00]  You didn't bring the inappropriate gung.  We were in shock.  Yeah.  J-D-O, J-D-O, J-D-O.  Thank you, Mo.  See?  Yeah, thank you very much.  All right, bye.  Hey, Noah, what's going on?  Sup?  I'm J-D-O, I don't think the song's that offensive.  No, no?  No, I think the KKK man was more offensive.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right, let's go to Tina.  Tina, what's going on?  Hey. 
[02:16:30]  Hey.  You guys got a winner.  That has got to be the most offensive song I've ever heard, even worse than the French guy.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, horny for little girl?  Yeah, horny for little girl.  What about the KKK song?  The KKK song was bad, too, but...  But this one's worse?  Oh, my God.  I called my boyfriend and told him to get out to the car and go listen to it.  Thank you, Tina.  Joe, I don't think you're a bad person.  I think you were doing your job.  That's very good.  She gets it, see?  Thank you, Tina.  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  No problem.  How about this one?  Matt checking in from Glenrock.  No song needed for the last one.  Fuel wins for spoken word.  Yeah, right?  It's like best spoken word offensive song.  George, what's going on?  Dude, Joe, I just chased three customers out of my business.  No way, man.  Guys, let me tell you something.  I just had three Jews in my business paying for cars.  They ain't never coming back.  They ain't never coming back again.  But I'll tell you something.  I liked it. 
[02:17:30]  There you go.  I liked it.  Thank you.  Syndication now, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  No, don't.  Let's see.  Keith, hey, Ant, the excuse, but it's just the most offensive song contest isn't working anymore.  I'm horrified.  Yeah.  You guys got some insight.  This contest has got to end.  Yeah.  I guess we got to find a winner.  Aaron, I can't take it anymore. 
[02:18:00]  And this.  I cannot take this anymore.  Well, I just squeaked in under the wire, didn't I, guys?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  There's a Jewish guy on the line.  Evan.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, I'm a Jewish kid and, you know, I've grown up all my life hearing  about the Holocaust.  And to joke about it, you know, it's extremely, extremely offensive.  Yes.  And definitely wins the contest.  But I think if you go any further, you've got World War III coming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's shit. 
[02:18:30]  No, I ain't.  Thank you.  Uh-oh.  No.  Oh, no.  Call me a pussy.  We're not playing that again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Call me a pussy.  I am not playing that again.  Oh, my God.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Come on.  Come on. 
[02:19:30]  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Wait a minute.  We'll use your technique.  You had to have how many black guys call in before you played the NBA song?  Well, come on.  You've got to have...  What is it?  Stop it!  What is it?  Stop it!  You have to have 10 Jewish guys or 20 half-Jews call in.  Someone's got to make a stand, man.  This contest is killing me.  That contest.  It's absolutely killing me.  It's got that a hand.  Joe, you can be proud in the fact that you've ended our contest. 
[02:20:00]  Be proud.  A screeching halt.  And hopefully you haven't ended our careers.  Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.  Your painful life is not the one day.  Oh, man.  Get out of here.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:30]  End of contest.  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  It is over, Johnny.  It ain't over.  It ain't over.  It ain't over until we got a song about the jinx.  All right.  It's over, Johnny.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Boy, thanks, Joe.  You're welcome.  I seem to have this effect on your radio show.  No wonder you guys never hired me on it.  Hey! 
[02:21:00]  Huh.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Any more instant feedback on that?  Oh, yeah.  Then my computer blew up.  Phone's just going nuts.  You mean it burns?  You are pushing it, man.  Yeah, stop.  Believe it or not, we want to keep our jobs for a while.  Oh, my God.  All right, great.  Okay.  Okay, terrific. 
[02:21:30]  Okay, terrific.  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  N-E-W.  That's it.  All right, let's take a break and regroup here, okay?  Yeah, do we have Buddy Epson's phone number?  I hope we do.  Do we?  I'm taking up smoking again.  That's what I got after today.  Wow.  Do we got Buddy Epson's number? 
[02:22:00]  All right, I'll find it.  Okay.  We'll be back.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Stand over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  1-8-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes, we love Stacker.  You got to lose weight, you want Stacker 2.  That's right.

[02:22:30]  they'll send you a free trial size with each order, Opie.  They're so confident that you'll love the product and lose the weight  that they'll send you a free trial size with each order.

[02:24:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Come in.  Come in.  Come in.  Hey!  Hey!  Oh, my God.  You're out of control.  This is how the original got started, you know?  Yeah, I know.  We're gonna dress you boys up in some nice uniforms next.  This contest has gotten so freaking out of hand. 
[02:24:30]  I can't handle it anymore.  Who's stepping down seven?  Oh, my God.  You know, you guys are having a little too much fun with this.  Gets me a little worried, especially Psycho Mark.  You're gonna get us screwed, I'm telling you.  We're in hot water as it is.  This is not good.  Not good.  Ten calls up.  No.  I'll put the Vulcan cannon on Psycho Mark. 
[02:25:00]  You know that's a gun?  Yeah.  I've seen those things fire.  That's insane.  When I was in the army, I saw them work out of the side of a C-130.  You have to see what it does to a football field.  Here it is.  The old days.  New technology.  You know how many shells?  It covers a football field with shells no further than four inches apart from each other in like 20 seconds. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  Wow.  That's how, and it's awesome to see.  I mean, I saw it live.  It's awesome to see.  Oh, my God.  Psycho Mark, go on.  Psycho Mark, just put your pen down and your paper.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Psycho Mark is out of freaking control.  Dude, leave the studio.  You're so stupid.  Just stay real quick.  Oh, yeah.  Go on.  Oh, man.  Psycho Mark. 
[02:26:00]  He's out of control.  He's out of control.  Psycho Mark has left the studio.  Go back into your hall.  So, how did you find out about Stacker 2?  It's so obvious who was in the intense meetings today and who wasn't.  I know.  Yeah, Opie and I in meetings.  Everyone else?  No.  Not in meetings.  Not in meetings, obviously.  They have no freaking clue what we went through today and are still going through.  And you guys are just pushing it.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  A little joke.  A little joke, all right.  Yeah, sure it is.  So, call me whatever you want, but man.  It was screened, right?  That just ended the contest.  It was screened, wasn't it?  Woo!  You guys aren't directly responsible.  I'll take full responsibility.  So, and Mariah Carey.  So, and Mariah Carey.  What a segue.  Yeah.  Woo!  Was she Jewish?  No, we can talk.  We can talk to her.  We can talk to her.  The second one is just laughing a little too hard, isn't he?  What?  A little too hard.  All I can say is you didn't hear what we heard today.  Oh, there it is.  You'd be a little paranoid, too.  Well, you guys aren't directly responsible.  You guys aren't directly responsible.  I'll take full responsibility.  So, and Mariah Carey. 
[02:27:00]  What a segue.  Well, yeah.  Well, was she Jewish?  No, we can talk.  We can talk to her.  The second one is just laughing a little too hard, isn't he?  What?  A little too hard.  Poisoning?  What?  A little too hard.  All I can say is you didn't hear what we heard today.  Oh, there it is.  You'd be a little paranoid, too.  Mariah Carey canceled her shows.  Let's see.  Oh, Tuesday night at the Fleet Center in Boston.  Right.  She had food poisoning.  Right.  Admitted to Massachusetts General for dehydration. 
[02:27:30]  She ate some raw oysters.  In Atlanta.  And became seriously ill.  Oh, my God.  You know what happens when you eat raw bad oysters.  I had some bad oysters, Stevie.  You know what happened.  That isn't like all of a sudden, you know, you're sneezing.  You don't have the flu.  You don't have to go.  Maybe you get a hive or two.  No, that isn't where it ends. 
[02:28:00]  If they're talking about dehydration, that means she pretty much was dry heaving from both ends.  Both ends.  Stereo projects.  L  Sounds of Mariah. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  Okay, terrific. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's got a nice ass, don't you?  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Bad oysters.  How about that? 
[02:30:30]  That was like Tommy Mottolo was throwing anthrax spores in our oysters.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The concert will go on.  Oh, yes.  We'll make those things.  Added sound effects.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  Yeah, she's got a nice butt.  In a related story, Celine Dion has a yeast infection. 
[02:31:00]  It's on her head.  Bake enough bread to feed all of Africa.  She got a yeast infection in that camel toe.  She's a survivor.  Yes.  I understand.  I understand Mariah's pain.  Let's go to Bill. Bill, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, I think that Mariah montage is more offensive than Joe's song.  It's in there, man. I know the pain.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not fun. 
[02:31:30]  You don't know whether to jump off the ball to put your face over it?  No, you just got to lean over and do it into the bathtub.  Oh, my God.  I never pictured her having Cranky, but...  Mariah's Cranky.  It's an indication forever, fellas.  Thank you.  Looks like a monkey's ass now.  A red manger, lass.  Looks like a baboon.  Flipping back and forth there, pulling 180s. 
[02:32:00]  Flip off the ball, huh?  Hot air balloon nut.  That's pretty disgusting.  Flipping back and forth.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  N-E-W.  All right.  Where's the Psycho Mark thing?  We've got to play that today, too.  Oh, calm down, dude.  Oh, it's on that one?  Push, push, push.  All right.  It's on the other machine is what you're trying to say? 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  I have to do a transplant.  All right.  We didn't even get to talk about opening day at Shea.  Psycho Mark went there with like 100 of our listeners.  Yeah.  Got completely wasted, it seems.  We do have audio to prove that, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Blah, blah, blah.  Oh, Johnny.  Johnny's a faithful listener of the show.  I was at the Mets opening day, seated in Section 35E, right behind the Mets dugout.  And we had the OK Terrific sign in fluorescent pink with black letters, and we were on TV. 
[02:33:00]  Channel 11 live right after Tom Terrific, Seaver, threw out the first pitch.  The camera was on us for five seconds.  We were also on Channel 12 News, CBS with Warner Wolf, and NBC.  I taped it.  Very effing cool.  We had chants going, high fives, and lots more.  We had hundreds of people walking up to us saying, great sign, an O&A role syndication now.  They thought it was for Tom Terrific.  Right.  Tom Seaver.  Right.  Like, OK Terrific.  Right.  But it was OK Terrific.  It was the famous OK Terrific sign.  It was all over TV.  We didn't even get to talk about it yesterday because we were so freaking busy with the Jay Moore fat guy fight. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  And I guess Johnny's going to bring down the sign and the tape because he's got footage of the OK Terrific sign all over TV.  So that's very cool.  Yes.  And, Psycho Mark, how was Shea Stadium opening day with 100 of our listeners?  I was there.  Yeah.  That's what we're hearing.  Reports coming back.  A very intoxicated, Psycho Mark.  We had a great time.  Yeah.  As much as I can remember.  I heard the seats were really high up. 
[02:34:00]  We were counting, as Anthony said, rivets on L-1011s.  I think we waved to you when we flew over Shea Stadium on the way back from L.A.  You know what I'm telling you?  Ed, that's where we're supposed to be.  Yeah.  One day, one of those planes is going to be like, I'm sorry, we're losing power.  Delta 635.  Oh, no, we're going down.  They're going to go right through that stadium.  And the pitch high and wide for ball two as an L-1011 comes crashing down in the outfield.  We pause for these words from Budweiser.  You know how they just don't get thrown. 
[02:34:30]  Johnny's all over.  Don't know if the grounds crew are coming out to cover the field.  Blood, guts everywhere.  Joey, what's up?  Guys, I was at the game the other day.  With Psycho Mark?  Yeah, I was with the guy with the Hillary Clinton mask and the big bra on.  Come on.  Yeah, I had a sign that said, I'm not a carpet bagger, I'm a carpet muncher.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was attached to a piece of carpet, and I had a big wow sign.  Oh, really?  So what happened was, I was going to throw myself on the grenade in Army terminology there  for the show, and I was going to run out onto the field.  Aw.  But I ran over the railing into the box seat to the ground level, and it must have been 
[02:35:00]  one of Giuliani's goons, but he got up and he clubbed me in the head while I was wearing  the mask, and I was getting ready to run down the rows.  And I went down and he yelled, not funny, get out of here.  And I had to run into the stadium to get away from him.  But I got also attacked by some news crews while I was jumping up and down behind the camera.  So you were going to run on the field dressed like that?  Yeah, I was actually going to throw myself on the grenade for the show.  I thought it would be pretty funny.  But yeah, I got beat up by a couple of those guys. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  So what are you going to do?  Did you guys get the tape?  I sent it to you.  Not yet.  The TV show Extra.  No, not yet.  Yeah, I sent it in, though.  It should be there today.  All right, we'll check it out.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Joey.  Love you.  All right.  Well, they played a joke on Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark in charge of all the commercials here at N.E.W., carting them up and stuff and  making sure they're ready to be played on the radio.  Right, Ant?  Right.  And I guess Spaz, who was here for this?  Spaz, Ben?  Spaz, grab the mic.  Spaz was running the show Monday. 
[02:36:00]  Grab the mic.  And they decided to pull up a prank on Psycho Mark and call him at Shea Stadium and tell  him that we were missing a commercial, which is a very big deal here at N.E.W.  Yes.  We can't miss playing the spot.  So, Spaz, you decided to prank Psycho Mark.  Yeah, with actually Ben's idea.  And then Ben said, come on, let's just...  Go, Spaz!  Y'all go, go, Ben!  And so I decided to do the call.  And throughout the call, Mark was giving me a couple of lines to spit out. 
[02:36:30]  And I think it went pretty well.  You mean Ben?  You mean Ben?  I'm sorry.  Ben, anything you could add to this little...  I think it's all on the tape.  Yeah, listen to how drunk Mark was.  Well, this is after the game.  I was in a bar.  Gotta give me a little credit.  You sound hammered on this phone call.  Of course I am.  I went to the friggin' Mets game.  It seemed like you weren't buying it at first, and then you got a little panicky at the end  of this prank call.  Shut up and go to the tape.  He's just belligerent.  Yeah, it's what it is.  Spaz now doing jerky boy phone calls. 
[02:37:00]  I'm going to show you I lost my glasses and my shoes.  I went to you by the seat, but I can't see you, goddammit.  I'm Frank Rizzo.  Open your FNS jacket.  All right, so here's Spaz trying to pull it over on Psycho Mark.  Completely wasted after the Mets game.  The jerky boys, but he's a true jerk, so it works.  There you go.  So here it is.  Stop it!  Let's go to the tape. 
[02:37:30]  I love that clip.  Here we go.  Good morning.  Yeah.  Mark?  Yeah.  Mark?  What's up?  Yo, are you there, dude?  Are you going to hear it?  Dude, we got a major problem here.  What's up?  We're missing a spot, dude, and it's running in the next spot break.  Oh, yeah?  Is Ben putting you out of this?  No, he's not, dude.  We're missing PIX.  Spot 109.  What am I going to do?  Is there another one in the cart?  Stinky, is it there?  I don't see it. 
[02:38:00]  Lying.  Come on.  No, I'm not lying, dude.  How the f*** can you go to a Mets game if you're not going to get your job done?  I need a spot.  What am I going to do?  Spaz, you know.  Pick a cup of coffee and wake up.  Wake up, baby.  Do Spaz radio.  No, dude, I need a spot.  How am I going to fill in a spot for PIX?  I don't see another one.  Do you see another one in there, Stinky?  A PIX one?  Dude, there's no other PIX here.  We need a PIX spot.  It's a blue dotted spot. 
[02:38:30]  Oscar winning performances.  It's a 62nd one.  Jim is going to be effing pissed, man.  What's going on?  It's got you, you laugh.  Stop f***ing around.  We need that spot.  What am I going to do?  Jim is gone.  Char is gone.  There's no one here to help me out.  I need your help, man.  Well, you know what? 
[02:39:00]  Write it up.  Write it up.  Write it up, but what am I going to do in this place?  I don't want my ass to be on the line for this if the spot doesn't run.  Last time I didn't run a spot.  I got in trouble, dude.  I'm not going to get in trouble for this again.  Mark?  Yeah, I'm listening.  So what am I going to do?  There's no other PIX here.  You got to come back and get me one.  What time is it?  Well, it's running your next spot, but I can probably postpone it to the next hour by switching  spots around, but I need you back to get it done. 
[02:39:30]  I have to run that spot.  I'm not going to get in trouble for this, dude.  Oh, well.  It looks like you're f***ing.  Wait, what the f***?  Get your job done before you go out and do s*** for promotions.  No, no, no.  Sit down.  Wait, come on.  You think you're going to be laughing when Jim finds out about this?  Oh, that.  Oh.  That.  Eee.  All right, we got to stop today here.  You are so hammered, man. 
[02:40:00]  I'm completely trapped.  You are so hammered.  He's doing muni impressions, and then he's doing a Ted Knight impression.  Oh, Danny.  Sit down, Spaz.  How about a press again?  Let's go back to the Spaz prank call with Psycho Mark hammered in a bar after the Met game.  Are you drunk, man?  Are you drunk? 
[02:40:30]  Are you high?  Excuse me?  Are you high right now?  No.  Well, dude, I need you back here now.  I need that PIX spot.  Well, you know what?  What?  You're not going to be there?  I'm just going to get Jeremy, then.  Dude, I'm just going to have to talk to Jeremy because I need that PIX spot, man.  I need that PIX spot.  Jeremy's down on...  Dude, I got to run that spot.  With all this PIX going down now, I don't need this. 
[02:41:00]  We don't need this.  Dude, stop PIX.  You're not going to be laughing when Jim's PIXing yelling at you about this.  They told you to get your job done before you left, but it's a damn Met game.  And now we're f***ed, man.  And you're laughing.  Dude, I signed out.  There were so many spots coming in.  Tara did not tell me about no PIX spot.  And if anything, it'll be put off tomorrow.  You're lying to your team.  I'm not f***ing lying.  I got to run this spot. 
[02:41:30]  Shut the F up.  Dude, I'm in...  You retarded.  Dude, this is my first time...  I cut my ass.  No way, because I'm not going to leave there and leave all my s***.  Dude, this is the first time I'm running worse stuff by myself, okay?  All right.  Who came and gave you the orders to put it on?  Dude, it's written here in the spot log.  Oh, yeah?  What's the code number?  109.  Oh, boy.  Whatever.  It's good, dude.  This 109 cart is in there, but there's a squiggly line through it, meaning it's not going to play. 
[02:42:00]  It says here in the log, PIX, cart 109.  As of 4.30, I called in, and I found out if there was anything remaining for tomorrow.  There was not.  Therefore, I signed out.  I said, that's it.  I'm not there for now.  Well, this must have been a late entry then.  Something might have been overlooked.  Something was probably overlooked.  It's in the log.  But you know how sometimes traffic sucks up?  You don't have to cart stuff up.  Are you capable of a human being?  Yeah, but I don't know what to do for PIX read. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know where the read is.  What is it?  A read?  No, it's a PIX spot, but I don't know what to do to put a spot together.  I'm not in production.  It's not a cart.  What is it on?  A reel-to-reel?  I don't know.  I don't deal with commercials.  Yeah, it's usually on at that.  It is?  Where can I get it?  It's usually right on my production table.  So I've got to look on your table then.  Ben, are you f***ing with me?  No, I'm not f***ing with you, dude.  If I was f***ing, I would have ended the joke a long time ago, but this is not a joke. 
[02:43:00]  It's my first time running worse stuff by myself, and usually Rick is here to spot these things,  and I don't know what to do now.  What?  Is Jim there?  No, Jim's not here anymore.  What do you mean Jim's not there anymore?  Jim's usually there until like 6 o'clock.  No, Jim's not here anymore.  No, he left early, and Earl wants you to get in trouble.  Right now he's trying to get into trouble with Jeremy.  In what respect?  He's in his office right now.  He's trying to get into trouble about this.  I tried to stop him.  Dude, if you make some...  No, but what do you think I called you first? 
[02:43:30]  I am about to get on the train right now and be there in 10 minutes.  Dude, why do you think I called you?  I called you to get a heads up so we can solve this without Earl going to Jeremy about it,  but he said, no, screw it.  Mark insulted me in the past, so I've got to go to Jeremy now.  I don't expect this to make no sense to me.  Is Ben still there?  I don't see him.  I tried calling his office about 10 minutes ago.  He wasn't in there.  Who, Ben?  Yeah, Ben wasn't in his office.  He said he...  Ben?  Where is Ben?  Ben is...  Ben is behind you tackling right now.  No, Ben. 
[02:44:00]  Ben came in late because he had to be here for a few days, and now he's out again.  He's behind you right now.  No, he's not behind me.  The only one in the studio is stinky.  Oh, God.  Trying to look for the spot that we cannot find.  Oh, the spot.  Well, you know, not for nothing, but maybe you braint geniuses.  What?  First of all...  I've got to hear that again.  Braint geniuses.  You're bleeding.  Don't be trying to find your story.  Well, you know, not for nothing, but maybe you braint geniuses. 
[02:44:30]  What do you think you braint geniuses?  First of all, Steve, why?  Get me this production order.  Get me this production order.  Get the production order.  It's going to be over the phone.  Where would the production order be?  On my desk.  It would say, be on the air with a huge highlighted mark.  All right, all right, dude.  All right, I'm in air one right now.  I'm going to put you on hold.  I'm going to go look for it on your desk, all right?  So keep holding.  What do you want me to tell him now? 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  He's ready to come back.  Don't you want me to come back?  No, what do we do?  Just tell me to joke?  I don't know.  Let's just keep bragging him on for a couple minutes, and then we'll...  What am I going to say to him now?  I'm running out of stock.  I think they're all saying it busted.  Mark?  Yeah?  I can't find a production order, and I also checked down...  There's no production order.  I can't find a production order, so I don't know where it was put.  Just write it up.  Dude, Stinky just ran down and... 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, write it up.  Hey, Mark.  Mark.  Mark, Stinky ran down, and Earl has got the door shut in Jeremy's office.  Well, that's good.  Earl, then tell Earl to go do the production, because he knows how to do the production.  He can fill in for me, but I am not there.  He's too busy trying to rat you out and getting you into trouble.  Let him rat me out.  I don't give a flying...  All right, dude.  All right.  All right.  Dude, write it up.  I'll deal with it in the morning.  All right.  I already signed out. 
[02:46:00]  I already spoke with my boss.  Don't try and eff with me.  All right, man.  Oh, my God.  Have fun.  Bye.  There you go.  You are a mess, man.  Isn't that genius?  You are so freaking hammered.  That's a good one.  Can you try and mess with me?  I don't give a flying...  How many rounds did you go through while you were on the phone?  Two rounds.  It was probably...  All right. 
[02:46:30]  Let's go to the phones.  A bunch of people that were with Psycho Mark at Shea Stadium Monday.  Hey, Chris.  What's up?  Yeah.  Actually, this is his friend, Matt.  I was with him, too.  We drove him home from the damn game.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  We took him home.  We saw him.  We were sitting with you.  Thanks for the tickets, by the way.  Oh, cool.  I hope you had a good time.  Yeah.  We did have a great time.  Yeah.  We drove home every day, you know?  Yeah.  We had a grand old time.  We were drinking a lot at the game, too.  Obviously.  Thanks for the ride, dude.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Anytime. 
[02:47:00]  Anytime whatsoever.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  All right, bro.  All right.  Let's go to Tommy.  Tommy, you're next on NEW.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, thanks for the tickets.  No problem.  Oh, you were at the game with Mark, too, right?  Yeah, I was right behind him.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was holding up all my signs.  Oh, cool.  Like, show me pudding.  I had an FBA sign with a skeleton.  Which is pretty funny.  And every time a plane passed by,  Psycho Mark was always going,  I think he was drunk and stoned before he even got there.  He was doing the 50 cal for the airplanes. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Well, thank you, Tommy.  All right, thanks.  Phones are crapping out a little bit there.  All right, Anthony.  That's fine.  There's Spaz doing a little prank call.  Yeah.  You know what's weird?  And I notice these guys doing it, too.  You know, after you get out of here, I find I go home.  I'm hanging out somewhere.  I'm talking to a friend.  I'm like, man, look at this.  The knock is on that.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't curse for a little while after you leave.  Well, if you do it for a while, you curse during, like, breaks.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  You know, you get used to it.  Like, when we go back to that office, forget it. 
[02:48:00]  I just had to give a little example of some of the language that goes on in the back office.  Oh, he just shakes his head.  We have our own little way of saying that.  It's more like, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Bill said that one time.  We were, oh, man.  Really quick story.  We're in a car.  I was going out with this girl at the time, and we hooked up with this girl and her friend, 
[02:48:30]  and Bill's in the back seat of the car, and the girl's in the back seat, and I'm driving.  They wanted to stop at some bar to pick something up, and the girl was in the back seat,  and the girl was going out with the time, gets out.  They go into the bar, and Bill's sitting in the back.  He goes, you know, he was trashed.  I mean, he was twice as trashed as Mark.  He goes, you know, that girl's a real.  I go, well, yeah, okay, so, and I'm going to say it to her face when she gets back in 
[02:49:00]  the car.  I go, Bill, no, don't.  Oh, Bill, don't do it.  The girl happened to be a stripper.  It was a stripper's friend, and these girls would have tore him a new one, right?  And I see him coming out of the bar.  I see these two girls walking out of the bar, and Bill's in the back going, I'm going to  call her.  Bill, don't do it.  Please don't do it, Bill.  Oh, God, Bill.  Bill, don't do it.  She gets in the car.  The girl is going out, gets in the front.  This girl gets in the back, and Bill's tapping me on the shoulder. 
[02:49:30]  He goes, I'm going to do it.  Bill, please don't.  Hey, you know what?  You're a real.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Told you, brother.  Yep, here.  Told you, brother.  She didn't have to work on that.  So what happened after that?  Oh, Major Melee.  It was a brawl.  That's the atom bomb.  That's the girl.  Take me back to the people's pub. 
[02:50:00]  Steve, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up, Owen A?  How are you?  Okay.  I just got to tell you, I think Spouse got his credibility back.  That was fun.  He stood with it.  I think he made up all the mistakes he made.  This is great.  You thought he was convincing in his little prank call there, huh?  Yeah.  That was the end.  I was starting to believe him.  Oh, cool.  It was really good.  All right.  Spaz's dad checker.  Thank you. 
[02:50:30]  Spaz might have a future in the prank call circuit, Anthony.  Jerky, Spaz.  Jerky.  Jerky.  Should I bring my tools?  I'll wrap you in your head with a ratchet.  I'm Cobb, I'm the Egyptian, Egyptian, Egyptian.  Egyptian, Egyptian.  Oh, my tooth.  He hit me and punched me. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  What's this?  I like to go crazy.  What's this Psycho Mark outtakes from the St. Patrick's Day?  What's this, Rick?  Why is Psycho Mark in shock?  Because I don't think he wanted this to come out.  But Earl kind of snaked him on this one.  All right.  How bad is this?  I guess you were out for St. Pat's, right?  Partying?  No, no.  The bar bat.  The bar bat.  And he went to another station event and continued to get hammered. 
[02:51:30]  And then came back and proceeded to do some production at 2 o'clock in the morning.  Wow.  Why is Psycho Mark all depressed?  Matamar.  That's true.  No, Earl does his show on Sunday mornings, which I don't think even the crickets listen to.  Hey, Earl.  Hey.  You're going to wear it's crickets.  Oops.  So he makes me do the community calendar on his show, his public affairs show. 
[02:52:00]  It's Earl.  I'm here.  I'm N-E-W.  Oh.  Let me ring Anthony's bell.  Truth is, he's not lying.  So anyway, he makes me do his community calendar.  And I came in.  I was ass-housed.  He couldn't put a sentence together.  And we got a tape of this?  How long is this?  Two segments of about 30 seconds.  Okay.  Let's take a listen.  Psycho Mark, drunken outtakes.  Here's the hearing. 
[02:52:30]  Right from the start.  Oh, my God.  Oh, please.  Do you want me to read this?  I can't read this shit.  That's all right.  Cut it.  No, I can't.  All right.  It's hot.  We're running hot. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Here's the second part of it.  Here we go.  Psycho Mark.  Here's the...  You can't get one more.  Hey, here.  This is a recovery channel.  This is great, you're all.  I like watching mudslides and trying to read copy at the same time.  Here's the community counter on 1027 WNAW.  You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness.  It claims to be an eye donor, and you may have someone leave the gift of sight.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:53:30]  This is torture.  Absolutely torture.  Torture.  It's torture.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Oh, my God.  You know, you need a little contrast on how drunk he is.  Where is the stacker read?  Just one quick line from the beginning of that with him like, hi.  Hi.  Where he's the smooth mark.  Shut up.  No, no, because... 
[02:54:00]  There it is.  Now, this is Psycho Mark at his best.  This is him in production.  Put it in five.  The way he's supposed to sound.  All right.  Here we go.  On the phone today, we've got Lisa from Staten Island.  Okay.  Very good, right?  Well, a little more.  He's going to talk today about her experiences with Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  How old are you, Lisa?  Okay.  That's great.  This is Psycho Mark at 2 in the morning.  Here's the community.  Psycho Mark at 2 in the morning. 
[02:54:30]  We're not.  All right.  Here's Psycho Mark again when he's normal.  Normal. 
[02:55:00]  During the day.  Three-five.  And how much weight have you lost with Stacker 2?  102 pounds.  Lisa, how did you hear about Stacker 2?  I heard it off the Opie and Anthony show.  So what made you decide to lose the weight?  Family gatherings were miserable.  I hated going out.  I hated when people took pictures.  I didn't have to diet.  I didn't have to watch what I was eating.  I could eat cheeseburgers, french fries, anything I wanted.  Now, did you talk to your doctor about Stacker 2?  Yes.  I went to a doctor regularly.  There were no health problems whatsoever. 
[02:55:30]  So, Lisa, I mean, how has Stacker 2 changed your life?  I look amazing.  I feel amazing.  And I love to shop now.  Hey, Lisa.  Lisa, thanks so much for joining us today and talking about your experiences with Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  If you think you can give us the plug before you go.  All right.  So there's Psycho Mark at his best in production.  Now, maybe a little bit of Psycho Mark after a few beverages.  At 2 a.m.  Here's the community calendar on 1027-WNEW. 
[02:56:00]  You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness.  Pleased to be an eye daughter, and you may have someone leave the gift of Stacker 2.  Stacker 2.  Stacker 2.  Thank you.  Stacker 2.  Absolutely torture.  Torture!  It's torture!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out! 
[02:56:30]  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Even the baby cow sounds drunk.  You may have someone give me a gift of Stacker 2.  Look at mine.  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  You may have someone give me a gift of Stacker 2.  Anyway.  That is great.  Unfortunately, he erased about three minutes of it because it went on for even longer.  Oh, we've got to save those.  Yeah, but he lost it, and thank God.  That is classic drunk Psycho Mark.  Very good.  What do we have to do?  We have to compare his Don't Do Drugs library. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, where's the Don't Do Drugs?  I'm looking for that.  Oh, that's the best one.  Damn it.  Where is the Don't Do Drugs?  Where is that, dude?  You know where it is.  What number is it?  Come on.  You know where it is, Psycho Mark.  You made it.  Yeah, that is funny.  I almost hit the guardrail the first time I heard this one.  Okay.  Coming out of Psycho Mark's mouth.  All right.  This is even better.  Psycho Mark's doing a Don't Do Drugs ad.  Raising children these days is no easy task, 
[02:57:30]  and it wasn't easy for your parents either.  The big difference today is there's a tremendous availability of drugs and alcohol  to children of all ages and the pressure to drug them.  As parents, you can help your children avoid the use of drugs and alcohol  by helping them develop self-esteem  and by teaching them about the dangers of substance abuse.  For more information and or counseling on substance abuse,  contact the local drug abuse center.  This message is sponsored by the civil engineers and professional staff  at Lichtenstein Consulting Engineers.  Hold on to your hats. 
[02:58:00]  Same person at 2 a.m.  Here's the community.  A little self-esteem.  A little self-esteem.  I can't. 
[02:58:30]  I can't.  I can't.  I can't read.  That's right.  I can't.  I can't.  All right.  It's all right.  We're running hot.  Mark?  Mark during the day.  Raising children these days is no easy task,  and it wasn't easy for your parents either.  The big difference today is there's a tremendous availability of drugs and alcohol.  About when you're around all ages,  you have a question to try.  As parents, you can help your children avoid the use of drugs. 
[02:59:00]  And mark it to a.m.  Here's the community.  Mudslides on TV here in the Discovery Channel.  This is great, you're all.  I like watching mudslides and trying to read copy at the same time.  Here's the community calendar on 1027 WNEW.  You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness.  Pleased to be an eye donor,  and you may have someone leave the gift of sight in Arizona to escape.  F.U., this is f***ing torture. 
[02:59:30]  Absolutely torture.  Torture!  That's torture!  T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T—50 caliber PFL!  Danny, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  That's even funnier than Anse tirade.  Yeah, I know.  You can't go.  Did you have the bottle next to you when you read that, too?  You're taking shots between breaks there?  I do not recall.  Call.  I don't even remember.  Oh, that's so funny, man. 
[03:00:00]  But thanks a lot for that.  I'm sitting here working, and I'm dying here.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Danny.  Let's go to Timmy.  Timmy, you're next on NAW.  Guys, I take it that Psycho Monk has no self-esteem.  Yeah, really.  Hey, Monk, you sure you weren't drinking mudslides and watching the Discovery Channel?  Will you read that copy?  Probably once.  All right, Timmy.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Bernie real fast.  Bernie, what's up?  Yo, guys, was that Casey Kasem I just heard? 
[03:00:30]  Huffing ponderous, man.  And now a dedication to a little dog named Snuggles.  To a goddamn death dedication.  Ponderous.  To, to?  Where is that Casey?  To.  Where is who?  Casey Kasem.  Uh, Steve, what's up?  Got to hear Casey.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey.  Psycho Mark's popularity has taken to a new level.  Yeah.  By improving that not only do drinking and driving don't mix, but now drinking and reading don't mix. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, you could blow out an eye.  He is now the true king of all drunken stutterers.  Uh, thank you, Steve.  All righty.  Bye.  I'm going to hate.  What a mess.  That is funny.  Yeah, where's, where's Casey?  See, this, this is classic.  This goes way back when Casey was doing American Top 40.  Yeah.  Someone rolling tape on him, uh, one of his tirades and must have snuck it out of the studio.  Yeah, let's play this.  Uh, a two-minute break and then we're going to play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today, okay?  All right.  Casey Kasem.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication. 
[03:01:30]  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.  Whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And here's what he likes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll mean a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles.  But he was most certainly a part of...  Let's go start again.  I'm coming out of the record. 
[03:02:00]  Play the record, okay?  Please.  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions.  And then you've got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for.  But goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow record.  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay.  I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record every time I do a goddamn death dedication. 
[03:02:30]  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.  This is the last goddamn time.  I want somebody who's a f***ing brain to not come out of a goddamn record that's up-tempo.  And I've got to talk about a f***ing dog dying.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2, 2...  What is this f***ing ponderous, man? 
[03:03:00]  Ponderous.  F***ing ponderous.  And...  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And...  Opie, Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Hey, it's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Let's start with Big Steve from Staten Island on the instant feedback.  Steve writes,  Yo, guys, Mark reading an anti-drug and alcohol ad is like Jeffrey Dahmer reading spots for missing children. 
[03:03:30]  Math from Manhattan.  Today I learned that Psycho Mark's PSA spots can be ponderous.  F***ing ponderous.  Ponderous.  And we go to the phones.  Dave, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned even with Mariah Carey, fart still equals funny.  Fart still equals funny.  Very good.  All right.  Later, fellas.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on today?  What's happening, man?  Hey.  I learned a couple of things. 
[03:04:00]  First of all, it was two for Wednesday.  Yes.  And according to Vinny, Miami is in Cuba.  Yeah.  Miami, Cuba.  We did learn that today.  Hey, don't forget the Paisanos lunch specials, all right?  All right.  Syndication.  Wow!  Thank you.  Later.  Let's see.  Let's go to Chris on line 10.  Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that if you drink like Mark, you end up working for oil at two in the morning.  Syndication.  In 15 minutes, your pizza's free. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  The whole syndication now chant is like going away.  In 15 minutes, your pizza's free.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  You're stupid.  You're so stupid.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Let's go to Johnny.  Johnny, what's going on?  Hey, O.B., how you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Jenny.  Hey, your brother's song, when he meets God, he will be Mr. Offensive. 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  Very well put.  If he meets God, that is.  This guy's too much for me.  Oh, get him off.  Dave, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that Anthony's brother has some serious issues. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And that's end of contest, man.  We didn't even scratch the surface.  I think he put the contest out of reach today.  Yeah.  Are you guys going to end it?  I think Joe officially ended our contest.  You've got to let him go one more.  I don't know.  I'm going to try and send one in.  I'm the guy who caught the egg, the blind guy.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How's it going, man?  During the egg shooting, we had Dave, the blind guy, catching the eggs that were coming  out of, what's-her-name's-you-know-what.  Ivory's private area. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, did you see the clips of Jay Moore?  Yeah, good job.  Hey, you know, I got a friend out in L.A. I've been talking to.  We've heard of you.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, people have been playing your tapes out there.  That's it.  We're syndicated on cassette tapes.  There you go, man.  We're like the Grateful Dead bootlegs.  Yeah.  I got to be an Anthony bootleg, August 1999.  Yeah, but they know of you, at least out there.  Cool.  Syndication yesterday, man.  Ah, that chant is not happening anymore. 
[03:06:30]  Thank you.  Maybe.  All right.  Maybe we could use them as a reference.  All right.  Keith from Seaford.  Hi, my name is Mark, and I'm an alcoholic caught in a mudslide doing anti-drug commercials.  Doug from Bergenfield.  I learned that Jay Moore is gay because he's got blonde hair.  Yes, we did learn that today, Anthony.  Finally.  Kyle from Westfield, New Jersey.  Open air at the newest game for the show.  What's wrong with Psycho Mark?  I just can't figure it out.  It's so effing hard, Kyle. 
[03:07:00]  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on NAW.  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Good.  Yo, there is a winner for the most offensive song contest.  I've heard all of these, and I cannot believe what I heard today.  Yeah.  I just couldn't believe it.  I'm walking out of my car, coming back from the car, coming into the house, like, oh, my  God, I can't believe it.  Yeah, these songs are just getting painful to play, painful to listen to.  Well, hopefully that'll be it.  Yeah, I don't know how we go on from there. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Doug from Staten Island.  I learned that in 2045, you guys will be syndicated in Bangor, Maine.  That's right.  Tony from Bayside.  I learned Spaz is better off with the Jerky Boys than ONA.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to 10.  Craig, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I learned that Spaz is going to test 747s on Fox.  This is Spaz, you're probably speaking. 
[03:08:00]  We're going to be plunging to an altitude of zero.  Put all your praise in the upper position.  Thank you for playing, Spaz, you're at life.  And watch out for the cancerous live wires.  We're going to be crashing into cancerous live wires.  And if you look out the right side of your cabin, you'll see a giant mosquito fell on the plane.  James, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  I learned today that after Hitler killed himself, he was reincarnated as Anthony's brother. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I think you're right.  No doubt.  But we definitely got a winner for the contest, at least.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Yeah, I think it's gotten to the point where I don't think anyone really wants this thing to go on, man.  Oh, of course we do.  Come on.  Oh, it is so painful.  No bit anymore.  It's just getting so out there.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Yeah.  Sorry, I was just playing with my fun toys. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, Ant and I learned something today.  What?  That we're stupid.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Yeah.  It's not good when your boss tells you you're stupid.  Stupid.  He actually called you stupid.  That's the word.  That's the word.  Stupid.  When was the last time you were called stupid?  Third grade?  I can't remember.  I broke a thermos in third grade.  I called him principal, and they said, why'd you do that?  And I said, I don't know.  I just wanted a break.  And they said, you're stupid.  I don't think that word's been part of my vocabulary for the last 20 years, you know? 
[03:09:30]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  When you're graduating from grammar school, I think you leave the word stupid behind.  Stupid.  Yeah.  All right.  What do we got?  I think we're done.  I'm a better drunk now.  Yeah, that's about all from what did we learn today.  Yeah, with that, we've got to thank Cowbell Bill for checking in and stopping by.  Not Cowboy Bill.  Cowbell Bill.  Yeah, I like when people call up and go, hey, I'm real good friends with Cowboy Bill. 
[03:10:00]  If you're real good friends, you'd know it's Cowbell Bill.  Cowbell.  Please.  That's the lesbian Danielle I did, yeah.  She wants to come in and be on the couch.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Invite her in.  Sure.  Sure, why not?  And, of course, Anthony's brother, Joe.  On a Sunday afternoon, the world I've dreamed between the lights and the lights. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, yeah, let's not forget Cowbell Bill's line of the day.  Two kickballs in a head-on collision.  Two kickballs in a head-on collision.  I'm not even going to explain it, but that definitely was the line of the day. 
[03:11:00]  And with that, we've got to step aside for Don and Mike.  We'll see you guys, hopefully.  Hopefully tomorrow at 2.  Hopefully.  We'll see you after the latest round of meetings that will occur very, very soon.  And it was actually two kickballs in a head-on collision.  All right, later.  All the other entities, we punish ignorance.  Hey, ask, turn down your radio.  1-0-2-7-WNEW. </pre>
