<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of twerking videos, sparking highly offensive and sexually explicit commentary from the hosts, filled with racial slurs and misogynistic remarks. They speculated on twerking's origins,  discussed a news story about high school students suspended for a twerking video, and then shifted to "Trunkin'" (dog fighting), expressing disgust.  A Texas caller challenged their views, resulting in a heated exchange.  The conversation further veered into anecdotes about Ben Kingsley, the One World Trade Center's construction, and a comparison of media coverage of a Slayer musician's death versus Lindsay Lohan's legal troubles, with the hosts expressing anger at perceived media bias.  A Cleveland caller engaged in a lengthy debate, partially agreeing with but also challenging their generalizations about the Black community.  Jimmy "The Greek" and Jimmy Tranny were mentioned. The segment concluded with more discussion about building heights and tabloid culture.

The next segment focused on Reese Witherspoon's arrest, with Opie repeatedly calling her an "entitled twat."  They discussed Mike Francesa ("The Pope of Sports"), a humorous anecdote about a coworker, Alan, threatening to bury a colleague (Eric) with heavy machinery,  an episode of *The Brady Bunch* (Alice's departure), an upcoming Liberace movie, and the show's impending channel change on SiriusXM, expressing concerns about listener loss.  A hockey player's brutal injury, the channel change, and the planned "Asshole of the Week" segment and "Taco Day" were also discussed.

A segment featuring studio guest Tom Papa began with discussions of police interactions and speeding tickets, before returning to Reese Witherspoon's arrest.  Highly vulgar commentary and impersonations of Witherspoon followed, focusing on her entitled behavior and use of the word "cunt."  The conversation then shifted to Tom Papa's upcoming show and a Taco Day celebration, including descriptions of tacos from Los Feliz restaurant and anecdotes from owner Roland.  The segment concluded with more irreverent commentary on Witherspoon's arrest and an unrelated story about a pizza place and Mayor Bloomberg.

The show continued with a discussion about tacos, transitioning into a story of the host's father intervening when a man attempted to solicit the younger host for sex.  This segued into a harrowing anecdote about a friend's accidental shooting in the Mojave Desert involving underage drinking, firearms, and dune buggies.  A taco shop owner was a guest.  The "Asshole of the Week" segment followed, with Alan repeatedly being voted the "asshole," punctuated by misplaced voting boxes and staff antics.  Listener-created songs about one of the hosts ("E-Rock") were played.  The segment concluded with reminiscing about dangerous driving and casual banter on race and sex.

A later segment focused on the "Asshole of the Week," again featuring Alan.  Alan's relationship with a Black woman was briefly discussed, followed by a conflict between Alan and Sal, focusing on a fired teacher ("Crunk Bear").  Sal's personality was debated, with accusations of narcissism.  Troy and Eric also weighed in.  The interns' contributions and the possibility of Alan's firing were discussed, along with Alan's gifts to the staff.  Listener calls, one suggesting a name change for the segment and another abruptly ending, occurred.  Discussions of Mother's Day gifts, gold-dipped roses, and a caller's connection to Jake "the Snake" Roberts were included.  A listener-created song about Eric and a call with Sean F. (the song's creator) concluded the segment, ending with Alan being sent home.

[00:02:30]  Twerk!  Just watching some twerking videos here.  Hot, right?  Hot, right?  No.  Hot?  So not hot.  It looks like if they...  It looks like they're ready to take a dump.  And if they do, moving like that, it'll come out like a Carville soft serve.  All nice and swirly.  That's disgusting.  What's the twerk all about?  Let's pretty much shake that A's, right?  Yeah, I can't believe you guys didn't know.  I fucking see twerking.  We knew.  I've been on top of twerking. 
[00:03:00]  Not literally.  It's fucking...  It looks like a mating ritual.  It looks like a fucking mating ritual.  And what is that shit?  Did you hear about the 33 high schoolers got suspended because they all got together and  made a twerking video.  Okay.  Where is this?  San Diego?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And what?  White chicks and there's some fucking guy right there, black guy?  Oh, no.  It's terrible.  I came close.  Wow, you all right?  He's just sitting there. 
[00:03:30]  White chicks are fucking stupid these days.  You're all dumb, you dumb fucking white chicks.  Why are they dumb?  Eh, you know.  Why are they dumb?  Well, you know.  See the video?  This looks huge.  Yeah, look at the girl's ass on the left.  That's a nice, nice A's.  It's just something you do for fun.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Kids twerk.  It's like a fun thing.  Yeah.  It's taking over the schools.  Wait, let me get the...  Oh, fuck.  What, man?  Like, oh, look, we're having fun.  We're twerking.  Yeah.  Everyone's trying to get their twerking video out there, right? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, it's the new shit.  It's the new Harlem Shake.  Yeah.  Let's see the twerk video.  This looks funny.  What are they saying?  The tall, skinny dude and two young blonde girls surrounding him.  This is fucking infuriating.  Don't keep it.  All right.  Welcome to the Skips Ranch High School 14.  I like that.  Oh, you fucking motherfucker.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of white girls standing on their heads twerking. 
[00:04:30]  They don't have enough ass to twerk right.  That one does.  Damn, she is...  Get the fuck out of here.  I hate your girl.  They're just twerking.  Yeah.  The police twerks.  Yeah.  Look at that.  They're all, like, doing kind of handstands up against the wall, twerking, shaking their 
[00:05:00]  bottoms.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah.  Black guys right there making sure it's being done proper.  That's right, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  So what happened?  Well, I guess they used, like, the school AV stuff for that.  So?  And then the high school suspended everybody involved in the twerking.  Well, what else are you supposed to use the AV equipment for?  Suspended for what?  Sexual harassment policy violation.  Twerking's not sexual, is it? 
[00:05:30]  Twerking's a little sexual.  A little sexual.  A little sexual.  Sure.  But what are you supposed to use the AV equipment for?  I don't know.  If not twerking videos, then what?  Exactly.  That's what I'm getting at.  You're supposed to make a science documentary about litmus paper.  Science.  Don't do any science projects.  Science.  What happened to that kid?  He's got a felony charge because he fucking made a what?  What?  He blew something up?  Yeah.  He made the, what?  The bottle cap pop off the soda or something?  And that's enough to fucking get him?  Yeah, because it's technically some kind of explosion. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  So now he's up on a felony charge, I think.  Un-fucking-believable.  Are you going to find that story?  Well, we got to...  This is Jimmy.  This is the twerking video that...  In Walmart.  Yeah.  Oh.  She's twerking at Walmart.  She's just got an extra piece back there.  That's her ass.  That's her ass slapping?  It's fucking disgusting.  Get the fuck out of here.  What?  Ugh.  What?  She's enjoying her time at Walmart.  That ugly ass.  Is that Walmart?  Yeah, she's twerking at Walmart.  Yeah, she's twerking in front of the milk. 
[00:06:30]  What's making that sound?  That's her ass.  That ass.  Our ass doing what?  Where's it clapping?  It's slapping the top of her thighs.  Oh, no.  Together.  Oh, together.  The ass is clapping.  The cheeks slapped together in front of the milk.  Wow.  She bends over, she squats, and she looks over her shoulder looking for her mate to come  over and mount her.  What a disgusting fucking display of shit.  Why are you so mad at twerking?  I know.  What are you mad at?  Yeah, twerking makes everyone happy.  Because it's another cultural thing that sucks a dick.  You know how good that would feel around your dick? 
[00:07:00]  No, it wouldn't.  Oh, it would milk it?  No.  How about you lay in bed and fucking kiss each other and fuck?  Boo for kissing.  How about that?  I don't like kissing.  How about you rub each other's nude bodies and you don't need some bitch looking like  she's looking for a fucking, the dominant male to come over and sniff and mount?  Oh, God.  It's a twerking video.  That would feel so good.  She has nice thighs.  Her ass is bigger than I like, but that would feel good on your dick.  No.  There's big ass cheeks rubbing your stomach and your thighs.  Stop.  Stop.  She's in front of the fish.  She's in front of the fish tanks twerking. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Look at the little fish.  They're all laughing.  Yeah.  And Jimmy the Greek got fired, man.  Yeah, because he said there were extra muscles.  Well, yeah, I'm trying to say this carefully.  Well.  But, I mean, I don't see white girls twerking like that.  I don't like that.  So it makes me think that there might be a little extra back there.  Whatever you want to call it.  How could you be so mad at a twerking?  You know, when you watch the blacks twerking, Jimmy the Greek fucking 2013, you know, when  you watch your blacks twerking, you realize that it came from the slaves of the 1800s 
[00:08:00]  and the way they would twerk in the field.  Jimmy.  Show me a white girl that could twerk as good as that black girl.  I like when the black guys direct the white girls how to twerk.  No.  I like that a lot.  I don't like that at all.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  I like that.  Fucking just an abomination.  I like a dominant black guy to stand there and those white prizes to twerk.  Jimmy.  Dumb little white fucking.  Hey, we know what you're doing.  These dumb white whores. 
[00:08:30]  I love it.  Someone's poking this morning.  Poke, poke, poke.  Poke, poke, poke.  Oh, boy.  Look at that shit.  There you go.  Worldstar Hip Hop knows how to fucking put up a twerk video.  Look at that big ass.  You know, I love when a thong gets eaten like that.  You do, huh?  That thong is gone.  I just think of the duty that's now in the thong.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh, no.  I think of that thong being eaten.  Fuck, man.  What do you think, eh?  At least it's fucking pale. 
[00:09:00]  That would nip your dick so good.  Look at that fucking fat hiney.  There's too much going on.  You hold on to those hips and just let it kind of shake softly.  Look at this fucking...  Anyone else seen a little dirt back there?  Just a little?  Yeah, was there a little dirt?  A little dirt back there in the hiney area?  I didn't claim the yard, but they bluffing, bluffing.  Come home and I hit it hard and she give me hands that's concussed.  All right, how could twerking make you mad?  Because listen to this shit.  That's Gucci. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, whatever the fuck it is.  I hate the encroachment of black culture.  She's twerking to a little Gucci.  Look at her big ass.  Milking some dick.  Oh, God.  You don't like Gucci Mane?  No.  He's out of jail?  I don't.  Oh, good for him.  Good for him.  Why was he in jail?  He was locked up on parole violations.  Oh, man.  Of course he was.  He smashed somebody in the head with a bottle at a club.  Well, that's not nice.  Yeah, he probably had problems, though.  What was the beef about?  I don't know.  I'm sure the people that he smashed in the head will just leave that one alone. 
[00:10:00]  There'll be no repercussions.  I mean, Gucci is the rapper who's got an ice cream cone tattooed on his face with a lightning bolt into it.  Oh, that's Gucci.  Yeah, that's Gucci.  Oh, we talked about Gucci.  That's sensible.  Right.  Are they called beefs these days?  You can still call it beefs.  All right, I don't want to upgrade my black lingo.  Look at that.  She's twerking a Gucci right now.  Yeah, look at that.  Her dad is just downstairs.  That's a deep crack.  Her dad should be up there fucking punching her in the face.  That's what her dad should be doing.  Jimmy, look at that deep crack.  I know you're a fan of the deep crack. 
[00:10:30]  I was talking to a girl with an ass like that one time, and she sent me a picture of the thong.  And I'm like, does the thong disappear in your ass?  Oh, yeah.  And she goes, yeah, my ass eats it.  And when she said my ass eats the thong, I fucking, I came all over my legs.  Jesus.  It drove me so crazy.  Yeah, she's twerking.  She is twerking.  All right, now she's tired.  She's like, nope, she's not tired.  No, she's still twerking.  Okay, she's still twerking.  All right, she's really working that butt.  Twerking.  What's wrong with twerking?  It, it, it, it fucking, it looks like a mating ritual. 
[00:11:00]  Sorry.  Anyone who doesn't think that is, is blind.  Well, yeah, it is a mating ritual.  It looks like some fucking mating ritual.  Just a damn.  Human beings are animals.  I mean, we're, we're no better than, we're one step above other animals.  Look at that.  That works, too.  It's a good ritual.  Well, when you see a fucking, that kind of works, it's right.  It sure does.  It's a little pink thong.  You want peace in Syria?  Well, let's send some of our broads over there.  Well, here's what I, here's what I think on a cultural level. 
[00:11:30]  I think, uh, the twerking, uh, thing, when you see, uh, when you see it going on in party  atmospheres and these giant gatherings that usually end in violence, uh, uh, it's this,  uh, mating ritual and it, it, it, it's a reflection of a certain, uh, culture where,  uh, the woman will bend over, present, shake her ass, and fucking hundreds of guys will just  come over and make like they're plowing in a reflection of, uh, many fathers, uh, one, 
[00:12:00]  uh, a mother and a fuckload of kids that I pay for!  Wow.  You gotta stay off certain websites.  What?  You gotta stay off certain websites.  No!  Sometimes it's...  What?  Truth?  Truthity truth dot truth?  You might be paying for some shit, but you still have enough money to get a dinosaur!  Exactly.  Right.  Thank God.  Sometimes it's only twerking.  No.  No.  That's true.  Sometimes it...  It's a reflection.  It's a reflection.  St. David Freud said that.  Sometimes a twerk is only a twerk.  No.  That's it, right?  No.  That's all it is in the end.  Look at this bitch twerking. 
[00:12:30]  Her parents aren't home.  Yeah, a white girl.  Look at that little white ass.  She's been taught how to shake that.  She doesn't know how to do that naturally.  But you know, that's not...  I mean, that's not her living room, obviously.  She lives with her parents.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  They're not home.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  She puts on the music.  That's true.  She twerks.  Yep.  Absolutely.  White girl twerking.  I like a white girl twerking.  But there's not enough meat back there.  It's not as good, but they've been taught how.  Oh, yeah, they have.  They've been taught.  They've been taught well.  They watch videos, and that's how they know. 
[00:13:00]  They've been instructed, yo, girl, move better.  Oh, God.  Man, that's some at-home tutorial shit.  That's right.  I think you need a little color to twerk.  Just a little bit.  That last girl was doing it already.  This girl...  She had a little color in her.  Just a little bit.  That white girl?  No.  She was a pure fucking airy person.  Don't look at her again.  Can't they twerk to Captain and Tennille?  That would be something.  What if they did it to Duran Duran?  Duran Duran?  Duran Duran.  There you go.  It looks good. 
[00:13:30]  We're watching twerking to the Ropers theme.  Yeah.  See, that would do very well on YouTube.  She's wearing her little booty shorts.  You know what song would be great to twerk to?  What?  Make it out.  Oh, no!  Perfect.  Make it out wouldn't be good to twerk to.  I'm not a fan of the twerk.  That's too bad.  You're missing out.  I think you're missing out.  No, I don't think I am. 
[00:14:00]  You're missing out a little bit.  Oh.  Ugh.  Look at that.  The girls are all having fun.  Yeah.  So they suspended 33 students.  Yeah.  And mostly because they used the AV equipment.  Yeah, it was because it was like a, yeah, they got all the, and, and, I mean, they referenced  this as a whatever high school official twerking video.  Why are they upside down twerking?  Because that's the fucking shit.  Because they're trying to do something a little different that no one else has done on the  internet yet.  Right.  And look at this guy.  He's fucking cool.  No, he's not.  He's just standing there like, these are my bitches. 
[00:14:30]  Is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  These are my bitches.  He's kind of squatting down like it's an old rap video from the 80s.  Exactly.  This looks like an 80s rap video.  It does.  It looks stupid on upside down twerking.  It's weird looking, but I like all those little white backs with the shirts falling  down over them.  Yeah.  And the dude, he just stands next to them and say, these are my bitches.  Nick twerk for me.  Twerk bitches.  Absolutely.  And all the bitches do.  They're like, all right, we'll twerk for you, daddy.  Daddy-o.  Daddy-o.  Daddy-o.  And then throws up some gang signs. 
[00:15:00]  Absolutely.  What the fuck?  He wants his boys to know.  What the fuck?  This is what I do.  Yeah.  Behave.  These bitches twerk for me.  That's right.  Holla.  Had it.  Their little white hands are all tired from take after take of twerking improperly.  And these guys are just like, what up?  Did you see the, um, the eye bang video?  If you want to talk about ass moving.  Some kind of weird yoga class.  Oh, yeah?  Pretty impressive.  I didn't see that one.  Go to the eye bang.  I think they tweeted last night sometime. 
[00:15:30]  Is there some kind of like butt moving fucking video on their site?  Hmm.  It should be on their site.  They tweeted it, aren't you?  They tweeted last night.  They ditch.  They ditch.  They ditch.  Oh, they ditch.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan of that at all.  Fuck the islanders.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Yeah, this thing.  Is it officially a twerking video? 
[00:16:00]  Watch the most mesmerizing butt video of all time.  Go to theeyebang.com.  Or theinnerbang.com.  I don't know.  The eye bang.  Really just let the legs relax.  And you're going to alternate.  Some kind of like alternative fucking workout class.  You got something for me.  Oh, she's shaking her ass.  Oh, shit.  She's doing yoga.  Yeah.  Doing like glute exercise.  You know, that's at least exercising, though.  They're doing splits on the floor, and then they're moving each side of their butt individually. 
[00:16:30]  And there's no thug in front of them throwing up gang signs.  You're going to fucking watch them shake their ass.  That's why this is not as good.  Right.  There's no BBC in the video.  We don't like it.  I wouldn't label this the most mesmerizing butt video of all time, though.  I'm sorry.  This?  I'm sorry to the eye bang.  It's a good video.  I don't like it.  It's not most mesmerizing.  It looks like a bodybuilder's chest when they make it tighten up. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek.  Making the pecs move, but it looks like it's the butt cheeks.  I like a soft ass.  I mean, firm is nice, but I don't like to see an ass flexing like it's winking.  Twerking.  I don't mind twerking.  Let me say hi to Psycho Bob in Baltimore, a regular Psycho Bob.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Do you think Marlon Perkins could do an episode on Mutual of Omaha about twerking?  Yes, he absolutely could. 
[00:17:30]  Here are the mating habits of the twerker.  And just have her fucking, that look over the shoulder like, come on, get some, everyone.  Hey, everyone, come and get this ass.  Why do you think she's saying everyone?  Because that's what happens.  And then guys come up, and they grab their hips, and make like they're fucking, and then  another guy will come over and make like he's fucking.  What is this garbage?  Twerking.  Twerking.  People are bored out there.  Was that twerking that was going on in Newark last night? 
[00:18:00]  What happened in Newark?  That's right.  It was shooting.  That has nothing to do with twerking.  No, really?  Who goes to Newark?  I don't know.  I don't get fucked what goes on there.  Apparently, there was an argument at a funeral that turned into fucking gunfire, and a 10-year-old  gets shot.  Wow.  Yeah.  That sucks.  Well, it's just another cultural issue I'm bringing up.  What does that have to do with twerking?  We're just trying to talk about twerking.  Oh, jeez.  Whoa, look at that.  Damn.  Is that a dude?  I don't even know.  Yeah, that was a dude. 
[00:18:30]  That was a dude?  Yeah.  Jesus.  That's all right.  Dudes can twerk, too.  But I didn't even know he was a dude.  It's all good.  When is this going to go to the wayside?  Whenever the next shit comes out.  Like the Harlem Shake did.  No, twerking is here for a while.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's going to have a bit of a shelf life.  Well, a booty clap was fucking, you know, before it was called twerking.  Yeah, but a booty clap was like a piece of twerking. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Yeah.  But it was the same thing.  Seth MacFarlane's got something on you.  What?  He just fucking installed a $1 million home IMAX theater.  A million bucks and it's IMAX.  How cool is that?  At his house.  It seems like that would be more than a million bucks to have an IMAX in your house.  Pretty fucking righteous.  That's pretty cool, though.  But what if the technology changes?  Yeah.  You're stuck with the IMAX.  Like, I have to update my electronics in my theater at this point.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  It's been, you know, five years.  Technology changes a lot.  That quickly, huh?  Yep.  Yeah.  Like, I saw some of this twerking going on.  I'm trying to move on from the twerking.  I know.  Because I know it bothers you.  No, but I'm looking at it.  You're still on the twerking.  When we were in Atlanta and Freak Nick was going on.  That was twerking.  I saw twerking going on on the hoods of cars in the middle of the fucking highway.  Yeah.  That's what's up.  But I wonder what it was.  Yeah, you just stopped the vehicle.  What was it called back then?  Because it starts with a T.  Twerking wasn't around yet. 
[00:20:00]  And with a B.  Jesus.  It's three lovely initials.  That means typical behavior.  That was Freak Nick.  Freak Nick.  Freak Nick was downright scary.  Yeah, you'd be driving down the highway.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, good.  I'm going to get to my destination.  Oh, why is there traffic?  Why is traffic stopping?  Why are people getting out of their cars and dancing on the hoods and fucking roofs of 
[00:20:30]  the cars?  Oh, look.  She's doing her fucking...  It wasn't twerking.  She's doing her little mating ritual.  Oh, look.  Guys are dry humping her asshole.  It was twerking.  It had a different name back then.  Yeah.  Why can't you let people celebrate?  By the way...  That's right.  Celebration.  Diversity dishmercity.  By the way, what you just described happened on a four lane highway.  Of course.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't it?  You forgot to mention that part.  It wasn't like a little lonely street somewhere that we happened to be on. 
[00:21:00]  We were trying to get to, I don't know, to our interview.  And don't try to stop the, you know, the cultural aspect of it.  Right.  Or else, you know, you'll fucking be called names and stuff.  I believe Atlanta finally...  How about we can drive on a fucking highway?  I believe Atlanta finally got sick of Freaknik.  They certainly did.  They pushed it out of town.  Oh, yeah.  Where's the Freaknik nowadays?  Any major city?  And then the businesses got in trouble because they wanted to board up their, you know, their  front windows and stuff. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, a fear of, you know, looting.  Mm-hmm.  Crazy.  Yeah, it was a problem down there in Atlanta.  Freaknik.  Every year.  Yeah, it's almost like when you go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, they have to have those  things that go over the windows.  Like, I was thinking about that.  Yeah.  Like, they have those shutters.  Yeah.  Because they don't want their windows fucking bashed in.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  White people should have shutters for their face when they walk down the sidewalk then.  Because their faces were getting bashed in as they were walking down the street.  Remember that?  I do remember that.  Oh, God.  That was... 
[00:22:00]  The blindsiding.  And we couldn't...  We could have warned anybody.  Standing on the balcony.  Oh, my God.  A bunch of black guys standing against a wall by a sidewalk where people would walk them  by.  And they would just wait for a white guy and white girl to walk by, a white couple.  And then they would grope the white girl.  And the second the guy had any fucking feedback about it, he'd get punched right in the face.  Or they would just walk by and there'd be a white guy walking by.  And he would just get blindsided, punched in the face.  And they would all just start laughing.  We saw this over and over again.  Oh, yeah.  From a balcony across the street at the end of the year. 
[00:22:30]  We threw beads at them.  Yeah, yeah.  And there was nothing we could do for the people.  And there's nothing we could do about it.  There was nothing.  Fucking ridiculous.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Since we're on...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Joe in Texas.  Go ahead, Joe.  Atta boy, Joe.  That happened, man.  You just jealous of twerking, man.  That's just shit now, man.  You're just an old man running your mouth.  I'm jealous of twerking?  Oh, shit.  Get the fuck out of jail.  Why would I be...  How are you now?  60?  Huh?  You 60 now?  Why would I be jealous? 
[00:23:00]  What do you know about dancing?  Why would I be jealous?  Nothing.  I know nothing of dancing.  Why would I be jealous of some fucking skank hoe shaking her big fat ass so a thousand  scales could grind their fucking diseased cocks against her?  Why?  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about right there, man.  Yeah.  You motherfucker.  Jealous.  Jealous.  You're jealous of my job.  Because I work.  See?  Get it? 
[00:23:30]  Unemployment number's out today.  Are they good?  I don't know.  Come out in a couple hours.  I guess we'll see.  All right.  I've had it.  Why have you had it?  What happened?  Because what happened?  Guy calls up and says that?  Well.  Well, because you're spoiling everyone's fun.  No.  People like twerking.  No.  You're trying to have a twerk party.  That's right.  I don't think so.  I think we thought we would turn this into a twerk party today.  I think there's quite a few that are of my mindset.  I thought it was Friday. 
[00:24:00]  Well, it is.  Thank goodness.  I thought it was a celebration day.  It is.  Taco day.  It's a taco day.  Yeah.  Is that going down today?  Yeah.  Since we're talking about cultural things, too.  How about Trunkin?  Have you heard about Trunkin?  Nope.  Trunkin.  That made me sick to read.  Yeah.  Amazing.  What is Trunkin?  Oh, how can it make you sick?  Trunkin is cool.  It's part of the culture.  Yeah, Trunkin.  You take a couple of pit bulls, and you throw them in the trunk of your car, and then you  play the music real loud, and you could drive around, or you could just sit there with your 
[00:24:30]  fucking partner, and then after about 15, 20 minutes or so, maybe a half hour, you crack  the trunk open and see who won, which dog is still alive.  And it's a new type of dog fighting that apparently is exclusive to a certain, you know, culture.  Jesus Christ.  And it's fucking disgusting.  That is horrible.  But again, you know, you'll only...  Where's that happening? 
[00:25:00]  Inner cities.  Florida.  Yeah, well, not fucking, not the beaches.  No, Mike.  Not the wonderful...  Is it isolated, or is it in a lot of inner cities?  Well, it's popping up in a few places.  Fucking Newark had a few cases.  Yeah, Miami.  Um, I think, uh, Detroit, I was reading.  I was reading a bunch about Trunkin' last night.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  I don't know how you can look at a dog and do that.  Well, it's...  I can't even wrap my head around that. 
[00:25:30]  You, you can't, you have no...  Because you have no compassion, no empathy.  Uh, you go through life, uh, with that, without any sense of consequence, or right, or wrong.  And, uh, no one can call you out on it either.  It's amazing.  It's an amazing fucking time we live in, people.  Amazing times!  Amazing times!  Amazing times!  Another song from fucking Drew.  No, you got your hit.  It's amazing times.  You got your hit.  Don't worry about it.  I know.  Let's say hi to Steve in New York.  Steve.  I got my hit. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  You're one better than Criss Cross, I think.  I think you got two hits.  I do have two.  I have a B-side.  One more than the Criss Cross guy.  Uh, Steve, what do you got?  Nah, I just want to call and support Anthony on this one, man.  That fucking guy from Texas is a fucking idiot.  Thank you, sir.  No, it's fucking bullshit, man, you know?  So, yeah, all this shit going on today, fuck these fucking guys.  All right, you really added to the conversation today.  Thank you, Steve.  He came close. 
[00:26:30]  He really added.  I could tell.  I have a sixth sense with that.  But he really added, though.  Yeah.  We're all about adding to the conversation.  Yeah, and there was nothing.  You could twerk without locking pit bulls in a trunk and having them fight each other.  You know what?  It's all part of the same fucking puzzle.  It's another piece of the same puzzle, my friend.  Now, you know, let's slow down a little bit.  All right.  It's all part of the same puzzle, my friend.  I'm a fan of the pit bull. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It's disgusting what happens in pit bulls.  It is.  But let's do the trunking thing.  Yeah.  What we do with the yip-yap dogs.  Would we have such a problem?  What?  Because I fucking hate yip-yap dogs.  People love their yippy-yip-yap dogs.  I hate the yippy-yappy dogs.  Yeah.  Those tiny little fuckers that have a huge fucking bark.  Here's my Yorkie.  Oh, I hate them all.  If I heard trunking with the yip-yaps, I don't think I'd be as depressed. 
[00:27:30]  Isn't that new on Comedy Central?  Trunking with the yip-yaps?  Trunking with the yip-yaps.  Oh, you see those fuckers all over New York.  Oh, yeah.  With major attitudes.  How does a dog that's the size of a Pepsi can have a major attitude?  It's a fucking city dog.  Oh, I hate them.  They live in the hoity-toity neighborhoods.  They sure do.  I like a spunky little dog.  Do you?  Yeah.  Do you really?  I don't like when they bark a lot.  But their bark is bigger than their bite. 
[00:28:00]  You just gotta smother them with love.  When they're like...  You just grab their head and go...  I told you my friend Dean was so crazy.  He was...  He loved dogs and would literally...  He would kiss their fucking...  Let them lick his face.  And he would just grab the side of their head and just hold their face and kiss it.  And he would do it to pit bulls.  Anything.  He didn't give a fuck.  There was something about this guy. 
[00:28:30]  He was so unafraid of dogs.  That some...  You know, anyone can be walking a dog.  And he'd go...  And he would just stop and grab its face and kiss it.  Jesus.  And the dogs just allowed it.  Sometimes they'll bite your nose off like that.  But nobody bit this fucking guy.  Wow.  I guess the dogs were like, alright, he's got something wrong with him mentally.  Yeah.  Maybe that.  Or they see some kind of dominant thing.  Like, I better not fuck with him.  Well...  Like the dog whisperer.  He was here the other day.  Yeah, huh?  I know.  I met him.  Did you?  Was he a nice guy?  Um...  Yeah, I just did a quick picture.  I mean...  How was Ben Kingsley yesterday? 
[00:29:00]  He was very nice.  You know that?  He's...  You know, he's royalty.  I was mortified because we...  Oh, God.  We tried to set it up.  I had to get home to a sick kid.  And had some stuff going on.  So we left.  I had construction guys at my house.  But Ben Kingsley was in very good hands.  You had, you know, Jim Norton sticking around.  You had Sam Roberts.  It was going to be a fine interview.  Yeah.  But I told Roland, like, look, I really can't stay past 10 today.  I've got a sick kid at home.  I've really got to get to.  And had some shit as well.  So I go, please, make sure that we don't see Ben Kingsley. 
[00:29:30]  Because I don't want it to be all awkward.  So right at 10 o'clock, we see Ben Kingsley outside the door.  I was so mortified.  Did you see how I left?  No, because I was running down the hallway at that point.  I left ass first.  Yeah.  I backed out of the studio.  Were you twerking?  I twerked out of here.  You left twerking.  I was presenting him my twerking ass.  Hoping that he would be distracted.  I backed out of the studio and then turned in a way where I never saw him.  Yeah? 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  Because I didn't want it to be all fucking weird.  Lucky you.  I flung the door open and locked eyes with Ben Kingsley.  With Oscar winner Ben Kingsley.  Who said, oh, wonderful to see you.  Yes.  I'm like, oh, no.  Hi, Mr. Kingsley.  Yeah.  I'm like, yes, I have a prior engagement, but you're in great hands with Jim and Sam inside.  Oh, thank you.  He didn't know.  I asked him to sign my Schindler's list at the end.  He goes, are you Opie or Anthony?  Oh, I'm kidding.  I'm Jim.  That's why we figured it would be fine. 
[00:30:30]  There was a really weird air to him.  And he was much nicer than I thought he'd be.  Yeah.  But I'm sitting there looking at his profile.  He had really good skin, I noticed.  Like, that's a really wealthy 70-year-old guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he looked good for his fucking...  Fixed care of himself.  Yeah.  But he just looked like a fucking...  He looked legendary.  There was a really weird vibe this guy gave off.  He's probably believing in that sir shit.  Hmm.  He didn't want to be in Cleaver tone. 
[00:31:00]  I wish I would have thought of that.  So, are you going to be starring in Cleaver?  God damn it.  I didn't think of it.  Because we only had limited time.  Oh, shit on me!  That's clever.  Yes, did you have to choose between Iron Man 3 and Cleaver?  Why didn't I ask him that?  I'm a faggot!  Oh, Jimmy.  He didn't want to be in Cleaver.  Cleaver tone.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Ooh!  Jay from Cleveland.  Hey, I call up a lot.  Welcome aboard, Jay.  Oh, I know, Jay.  What's up? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Hey, dude, you make good toys, but when you go off like this, every fractional thing that  you've ever made goes completely the fuck out the window.  Could you steal a new phone, sir?  This one's breaking up.  First of all, fuck you.  Oh, right.  I've worked full-time.  I've been working full-time since I was 16.  Ooh.  I'm not one of these regular fucking niggas that go around and think, oh, this going around 
[00:32:00]  robbing is cool.  Or actually co-sign for all this shit that actually goes on.  Well, good for you.  I like that.  Yeah, but you lump every last little black guy into this.  Have I said that?  I've never said that in my life.  I've never lumped every black guy into a category.  What I've said is there are cultural problems in the black community.  Things that are considered cultural.  Things that are considered cultural that are nothing but poor behavior. 
[00:32:30]  That can't be called out on because they will address it as a cultural issue and you're  being racist by even mentioning them is what I'm saying.  I'm not lumping everybody into it.  Some people are able to break off of that cultural aspect and act and assimilate to a  culture, a civilized society.  Others, not so much.  Stop, stop, stop.  Do you realize there's more black people that actually see your side of it? 
[00:33:00]  There's more black people that actually are out there working.  Well, good.  Maybe they'll talk about it then.  Maybe they'll get it in public on public airwaves and actually address it and talk about it  instead of supporting it in silence.  What?  We don't support it.  No, I mean supporting my point of view in silence.  Jesus Christ.  Don't you understand what I'm saying?  How about you speak up and be lambasted and called an Uncle Tom by your black contemporaries 
[00:33:30]  because you agree that crime is rampant in the community and certain aspects of child  rearing and what, what, what?  First of all, motherfucker, I have.  I grew up in a mixed community and I've been called an Uncle Cracker, Tom boy, and anything  I grew up listening to everything.  I had a rebel flag on my car in a fucking drag race.  But yeah, when I moved back to Cleveland from college and I lived out in the fucking hood, 
[00:34:00]  niggas fuck with me every fucking day.  I don't think I got to call that shit.  So we're actually on exactly the same page.  We are on exactly the same page.  I kept doing what I needed to do.  Yeah.  That's just saying.  What's your argument with me then?  I'm agreeing.  I'm agreeing with you.  Yeah, because you want me.  No, I didn't. 
[00:34:30]  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  I think you're great.  I have respect for you being able to shun that portion of the black society and be a  working, productive member of society.  It's a wonderful thing.  Why is that a problem?  Why is that a problem?  Because I take offense when you say stuff like typical nigga behavior.  First of all, instead of just saying the letters and going underground with it,  being bold, pull your balls up and put your B-boy panties on. 
[00:35:00]  Well, I can't say certain things because certain people will get me fired because there is  an immunity that goes along with being a thug.  I'm one of these guys that will stand behind you to say it because I don't believe words  should be fucking censored.  Yeah, thank you.  There's a lot of us that you don't have to worry about.  Well, not enough of the voice like Reverend Al.  There's a lot of us that you don't have to worry about. 
[00:35:30]  Well, I'm watching a girl take a giant fucking two liter Coke bottle up her twat right here.  Oh, wow.  It looks like every girl that dates me.  Wow.  And she's a skinny penis.  I feel like you don't hang out with enough black people to actually know that.  All right.  Come over for a party.  It'll be fun.  Do you know something?  I will.  I will.  But like this, we've got a Ford race going on in Queensland.  You bring that little Mustang of yours and we've got a Mustang that'll run you off the road.  Ooh.  Sounds like a race. 
[00:36:00]  You want to go?  So we'll have a, what, like a little, so we'll be racing cars?  Yeah, we've got a nice little turbo Mustang that'll run 990.  So we could call it like a race war.  Oh, yeah.  Something that you always wanted, right, Dan?  Yeah, you want to race for pinks.  All right, Jay, don't worry so much.  You know, I got to figure it's something to say until 10 o'clock.  So sometimes it's this. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  Thanks, Jay.  All right, Jay and Cleveland.  I can't get into the whole, you know, racial argument today.  Especially when that, look, Sam brought us all together with a girl who's.  Well, it's like you were saying.  I mean, you know.  Wow.  Yeah, there's a world star hip hop video.  A girl's working a Coke bottle.  She can't quite work it, though.  She can't get it over the shoulder of the bottle, can she?  That's a hell of a way to sell Coke.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Imagine if you put that on TV. 
[00:37:00]  I think you'd sell a lot of fucking Coke.  Yeah.  That's a Bill Hicks bit, though.  I think he did it with Pepsi or something.  If you could find that.  If you could find the Bill Hicks Pepsi bit, that'd be great.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  I don't know that one.  Man.  See the big fucking spire being lifted up onto the one-world trade?  Sure did.  That's pretty cool.  Tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, I believe.  Third tallest in the world.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  I think is what they're saying.  Yep.  It's behind, obviously, the Burge in Dubai.  And what's the second tallest?  Is it Taipei?  Yeah, probably a weird one in Taipei.  Taipei.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're beating out Chicago with this building?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I wasn't sure we were beating out Chicago.  By a good amount, I think.  By a good amount, huh?  This is going to be when it's done 1,776.  1,776.  I get it, but I'm right with that.  Just make it taller.  But wait.  But wait.  Some asshole is going to measure it scientifically and go, 
[00:38:00]  it's only 1,774 feet.  Exactly.  You know what's fucking amazing?  The fact that you could build something that big and have it come in  to a foot, you know?  I don't know.  I bet you it's a little off.  I bet they check, and there's some kind of spaces they could use with the last spire piece  to adjust it a few feet.  Yep.  You know, so they can get it exactly.  They have that, I heard, in the Burge Tower.  They won't say how much room they have. 
[00:38:30]  I'm going to guess they have another 100 feet or so.  A little wiggle room to boost it up.  To go higher if they want to.  A little higher?  Yep.  Just in case someone beats them out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But how much bigger is that building?  Oh, that's...  Oh, it's over 2,000.  Can you check the tallest buildings in the world by size?  It's much bigger than this.  It's over 2,000?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, it's crazy.  This one should have went to 2,001 feet.  Like, instead of 1776, 2,001 would have been great.  That's another 20 stories, almost, though.  I see that on the top, yeah.  Look at how much bigger that building is. 
[00:39:00]  It's massively bigger.  And the one in New York.  I mean, you see this fucking new building from everywhere.  It's unbelievable.  It pops.  Yeah, driving in.  It pops up way before any other building.  That's pretty fucking cool, obviously.  You see it in all sorts of...  All parts of Jersey.  A lot of parts of Jersey.  Yeah.  You could tell when they were putting the Spyron,  they got a good look at the construction going on on top.  I guess they're going to have another kind of  in-the-round restaurant up there.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because you could see the... 
[00:39:30]  That would be cool.  ...the round construction going on up there.  Yeah, that was cool.  I went into the one in the Trade Center once.  It was pretty fucking...  Pretty cool.  Do you want...  Windows on the world?  Yeah, I was up there.  I was like...  Yeah.  You look down and just like...  And that's what I thought of.  I remember looking down and how high up that was  and how awful it would have been to have to...  Yes.  Horrible.  Because even at the time, you look out and go,  God, imagine what it would be like just jumping out of there.  Yep.  Oh, and then the thought of someone actually having to do it. 
[00:40:00]  I got a picture.  I did a gig in between the towers many years ago.  It was a noon gig.  They would do it between the two buildings in that courtyard.  I wish it was the morning of September 11th.  Yeah, it would have served me right.  And David Tell did the show.  I forget who else did it.  This is probably 1999 or 98.  And my girlfriend at the time and I went.  And she took a couple...  I'm glad I got pictures of that.  And she and I went to the top of the building.  And I got a picture of us on top of the building.  And a picture in the... 
[00:40:30]  It's kind of a shadowed picture.  But I'm kind of standing in the window.  Kind of like pressed up against the window.  Yeah, yeah.  Such a fear of mine is falling from that.  I've been a fear of everybody since it's falling.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I don't have a fear of plummeting.  So how tall is the tallest building?  I don't know.  It's much bigger.  By the way, it's only 76 stories or something, the Freedom Tower.  But they built these windmill spires on top, inside the building, to provide power, to  make it look bigger.  Yeah.  Because they couldn't get people to rent the top floors.  Right.  That's the bottom line.  No businesses would rent after what happened. 
[00:41:00]  Does it matter what floor you're on after a certain amount of floors?  After the fucking fire ladders can't get to you, it really doesn't matter anymore.  That was just the thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody's putting their business over there.  And it's such a target.  Yeah.  It's absolutely a target for the rest of the world.  There are a lot...  Aside from planes, which, you know, very hard to defend against those, any other type of  thing, they put in a lot of safeguards and security.  Even the shape of the building at the base is set up to deflect a truck bomb or anything 
[00:41:30]  like that.  It's actually constructed in a way where the blast is deflected away from the building.  Wow, they threw that shit out.  Yeah, they got a bunch of safeguards in there.  But again, a plane, it's kind of hard to defend against.  So how tall is the Berg?  It's not saying.  It's over two.  Over two.  Can we just go...  The 1776.  Can we just Google Berg height?  It's fucking...  And where's the Sears Tower at?  The Sears Tower? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, it's called something else now.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's called the Willis.  The Willis, right.  What are you talking about?  2,722 feet.  27?  What?  It's 1,000 feet tall.  1,000 feet taller.  It's one trade center building taller almost.  Whoa!  That's cray.  What?  That's crazy, man.  It's 2,700 feet taller.  Holy shit.  I mean, I'm sorry, 1,000 feet taller.  1,000 feet taller.  Wow.  Why do these little places have these giant buildings?  Because they have fucking oil money. 
[00:42:30]  That's like oil money.  Yeah.  They have so much money in Dubai.  That's fucking sick.  That is sick.  Jesus Christ.  It'll be a long time.  I didn't realize the towers...  There's the...  The Petrosian...  Are they called the Twin Towers and...  Petrosian Towers in Malaysia?  Malaysia.  Are 88 stories.  And what's that building...  There's a building next to the...  With a hole in it?  It will have the...  It's the Shanghai World Finance Center.  It's still building it, I guess.  The giant hole in the middle. 
[00:43:00]  Wow.  That's huge.  1614.  1670 is the Taipei Tower.  And then this is the second tallest building.  Is it in the world?  There's one more.  No, there's one more.  Definitely.  Tallest in the Western Hemisphere.  Third in the world.  I don't know what the second...  I don't...  I don't know what he is.  I think the Burge is like legitimately though...  Because that's building up most of it.  Most of it.  Like there's high-rise apartments and a hotel in it.  I mean, it's not nearly as wide as the Freedom Tower or these other... 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But I would love to stay in there.  I want to go to Dubai with Jonathan and I want to stay.  There's nothing...  The hotel that's a big sale is supposed to be nicer.  I think it's Calvin Klein or some weird company has a hotel in the Burge.  And I want to sit supposed to...  Really?  Yeah.  You should go.  Way up there?  Yeah, but I don't know when we're off.  We got to take a fucking scheduled break.  Yeah.  Just take your time.  Take your time.  I can't do that.  I feel too... 
[00:44:00]  I can't.  Oh, Jimmy.  I've been missing stuff.  I can't do it.  Oh.  What big guests come through or this stuff going on?  Oh, just take your time.  I'm taking a lot of Fridays off instead of an actual vacation because I can't want to  go anywhere with two little ones.  That's true.  I don't know.  We haven't really had a week off straight since Christmas.  No, no.  It's always been around, yeah, holiday.  Yeah, we'll take some time around Fourth of July.  We'll do a little time around Memorial Day.  It's the Fourth of July. 
[00:44:30]  Those beaches will be open.  I think the Terminator said, I need a vacation.  That's a funny line.  In front of Terminator 2.  I like that we keep the channel alive most of the year.  It's kind of cool.  Sure.  We all just take our turns, you know, taking our days and doing whatever the fuck.  We rotate.  So just take a week and just fucking have fun, man.  By the way, this is why the paper...  I Twittered this photo.  I saw.  I just saw you tweeted that.  That's why the press is so fucking revolting.  It's just such a tabloid cunt society. 
[00:45:00]  Yep.  Jeff Hanneman, who's one of the founding members of Slayer, died of liver failure.  And, you know, again, he's not as famous as a lot of other guys.  Mm-hmm.  But he's well-known enough to get some kind of coverage in the paper.  I don't think the Daily News mentions him at all.  And I Twittered the size of the difference in the articles for him.  And what this fucking little brat Lindsay Lohan gets for skipping on rehab again. 
[00:45:30]  It's like she gets a full page of coverage.  Yeah.  And she's doing nothing.  No.  No, she's...  She's contributing nothing.  And she's laughing.  But it's just a disaster.  She's laughing in the face of her...  And the legal system just sucks.  The legal system, yeah.  But this guy dies of liver failure and he gets...  And again, I understand.  I'm not saying he should get the same coverage as fucking...  As if Robert Plant died.  Yeah.  But a little more than this cocksucker...  It's teeny-weeny.  Fucking...  What is it?  Six inches...  Four inches long. 
[00:46:00]  And an inch and a half wide article while she gets the full page.  We're just a tabloid dog shit society.  We really are.  We're a dog shit fucking society.  And what was her problem this time?  She got close to rehab but didn't actually go in.  Then she was shopping.  Then she was trying to get a plane back to New York.  But if she got the plane back to New York and landed in New York, they could have arrested her.  So her father...  The only reason we know this is because the father had to tell the press that she called up Lindsay Lohan and said,  Hey, if you land in New York, they're going to arrest you.  So don't do that. 
[00:46:30]  Why is he telling the press all this shit about his daughter?  Because he's an attention whore and she's a coddled brat.  We should have known what happened to her yesterday.  Yeah.  She went to the rehab.  She didn't go to the rehab she was supposed to because they don't allow smoking.  I almost understand that.  If you're a smoker, the idea of being a month without a cigarette is a manic.  So she was supposedly flying to California and just going to one that had...  But all these handlers and people...  Can somebody just tell her, shut your fucking mouth.  She should just get locked up.  Why is the whole country a codependent partner when this brat is doing what she wants to do? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  The whole country, the legal system, is acting like a fucking henpecked wife or a frightened husband.  Yeah, yeah.  She's a fucking brat.  She was doing some last minute negotiating with the rehab place.  Like, who gets to do that?  No one.  No one.  And I mean no one.  I don't even think other celebrities could do that.  You're told what to do. 
[00:47:30]  It's unbelievable.  They tell you.  There's no negotiating.  You try that with some other...  You get a DUI.  Try that shit with going to rehab.  I'm not going to show up for court and then I'm not going to go to rehab and I'm going to play.  All the people who are enabling her, she's eventually going to...  She's going to die.  She's eventually going to hit a pole or she's going to commit suicide or she's going to overdose.  She's going to fucking die from doing this.  And all you fucking little faggots in the legal system and you weak judges and you little pussy lawyers,  all of you are contributing.  Yep.  Because none of you are actually making her face consequences. 
[00:48:00]  No.  All you fucking cocksucker judges and lawyers that are like,  Well, next time.  Well, next time.  When she eventually drops dead,  half of the problem is you codependent little pussies wouldn't just make her face a penalty.  She can't get high in jail.  Right, right.  If you lock her up, she's not going to be getting high.  She's going to be forced to detox.  So the legal system really is a cocksucker.  That's amazing.  And a codependent fucking partner.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  According to BC Justin on the old Twitter there,  the second tallest building is a clock tower in Saudi Arabia.  Is that true?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  We're going to look that up.  And this guy makes a good point about twerking it.  Yeah?  Yep.  CBR underscore 11 XX.  Twerk video is to the black guys as hula hoop videos are to the white guys.  Oh, okay.  We all lost our shit over that hula hoop girl.  Yep.  Who ended up doing a video for our show.  Yeah.  And she was shaking that ass nice. 
[00:49:00]  Shaking that ass.  She was shaking that ass real nice.  Her original video is way better than any video she's done since, by the way.  Absolutely.  The one where she's at a little music festival.  Sure.  Holy fuck.  But what's the difference there?  Katie Sunshine.  Katie Sunshine.  What's the difference there?  I don't know.  She's shaking that ass real nice.  And you're thinking all sorts of shit when she's shaking that ass real nice.  I do kind of just like the original one, yeah.  The original hula hoop video? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty good.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  To each their own, I guess, right?  That's what they say.  When we get back, we're going to talk about Reese Witherspoon.  Reese Witherspoon.  Yeah, I saw the video.  What a twat.  She really was really trying to play that Reese Witherspoon card.  Another entitled twat.  Do you know who I am?  Who gives a fuck?  Do you know my name?  How crazy that was taped?  I know.  And the guy's like, who gives a fuck? 
[00:50:00]  I don't care who you are.  I'm doing my job.  No, sir.  I don't see your name, sir.  Did you see the video?  You see the video with her man?  I don't know if they're married.  Are they married?  Yeah.  The man goes, her husband goes, I'm sorry, I tried.  I tried.  I tried.  I tried.  And he goes, this has nothing to do with me.  And I was just thinking to myself, man, every guy has been in that position.  Sorry, sir.  I tried.  I can't control it.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, sir.  He's just in hell.  Right.  Drunk and Reese Witherspeen. 
[00:50:30]  We're going to do the Reese Witherspeen.  And, you know, I love when our audience turns us on to new Mike Francesa shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  This one's from a couple of days ago, but it'll certainly play well today.  Another clip from Mike Francesa's radio show.  Yeah.  What do they call him?  What's his nickname?  The Pope of Sports or the Sports Pope or the fucking, what do they call him?  They call him that?  Something like that, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Something like that. 
[00:51:00]  But we'll do that as well.  Yeah.  And tacos on the way?  Yeah, should be.  Oh, I shouldn't eat so much then.  I'll just eat half my sandwich.  Yeah, but we can't just have tacos.  They have to be dipped in whipped cream and all sorts of shit.  Oh, the New York City, like, fancy schmancy tacos.  Is that what we're getting?  I don't know.  They're probably deep fried and then fucking maple syrup has to be on them.  Maple syrup.  Give me a fucking taco.  These are good tacos, man. 
[00:51:30]  I don't need the sour cream.  Maybe a little guac.  No, best taco to the place to make it.  What?  There always has to be a catch with New York food.  Yeah, yeah.  He said a word the other day.  It was fantastic.  It was a t-shirt and it came out like t-shirt.  T-shirt.  T-shirt.  Hey, are we doing Alan's bit today?  We should.  Asshole of the week.  Oh, God.  Let's do Asshole of the week.  Does it change at all for anybody week to week?  I think I skate this week. 
[00:52:00]  I'm confident that I'm not Asshole of the week.  I feel pretty confident about that.  It has to be based on events that happened this week.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Sure.  Alan, you ready to do your bit?  I can do it.  What was that?  Yeah, I can do it.  I can do it.  I don't know.  We might do Asshole of the week.  It worked pretty well last week.  As much as we were making fun of the kid.  Found out yesterday.  Eric's very mad at him because the other day in the office, he was trying to make Sal and 
[00:52:30]  Roland laugh.  Right.  And he said that when Eric dies, they're going to have to...  What kind of machinery were they going to have to use?  You know damn well.  No.  Yeah, you do.  No, I don't.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah, we didn't hear it.  Have Alan come in and tell you.  Oh, come on.  Why?  You're right there on mic.  Why waste time?  He has to walk down the long hall while he's running down the hall with his bit box.  Look, he has to have a special box.  Why wouldn't he just use the hat on his head?  Anything.  Yeah.  No one wants to reach into his hat. 
[00:53:00]  The stupidity that language isn't there most of the day.  Alan, why do you have to have a special box for your bit?  Well, the idea was that people would put in boats throughout the week, but I don't know,  because after last week, I thought the bit was kind of a bust, so I just kind of shelved  it.  We told you the bit was good.  Other people didn't.  Oh, boy.  Roland. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, boy.  Roland's just trying to get under your skin.  That's all Roland does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, he's a great booker, but when he's not booking guests, he just wants to get under  people's skin.  He's a great booker and a terrible human.  What did you say that got Iraq so mad?  Oh, what was that, like two days ago?  Yeah.  I was just hanging out with Sal and Roland, and I don't know, they were talking about  Iraq being dead for some reason or another, and I said that they need to use a digging  crane to make his grave. 
[00:54:00]  A digging crane?  Yeah.  I don't know if that...  What's a digging crane?  I don't know.  I knew that wasn't, like, the right term.  I couldn't...  Yeah.  Yeah.  A backhoe?  Probably.  You mean, like, one of the gigantic ones that you drive that has a big scooper?  Yeah, yeah.  Why would they need that?  Just because...  Because, what, the size of the hole?  Um, yeah.  Why wouldn't they just do it with shovels?  An excavator?  Don't you weigh more than the Iraq?  No, no.  It's got to do it up and down.  No, I'm, uh, I'm about, like, 200, 210, something like that. 
[00:54:30]  Iraq, now what's your weigh?  Enough.  Enough.  So why would they use a scooper?  I'm not sure.  I don't follow you.  A digging crane.  I don't know.  It was just a stupid thing.  No, wait.  Why?  Explain.  I'm curious.  Uh, because, you know, it's, it's such a big, you know, undertaking to make a hole that big.  You know, it's just...  But why would he need a hole that big?  It was a stupid fat joke. 
[00:55:00]  Oh.  Um.  So you're saying because he's fat.  I mean, he's not that fat.  Why would you need a digging crane, then?  Alan, when you find yourself in a pickle, calling Iraq fat will always get you out of it.  We heard you, Sam. 
[00:55:30]  Because Iraq's fat?  Ah, because Iraq's fat.  Outstanding.  Iraq?  Comment.  Yes.  How do you respond to these allegations?  What the fuck's going on?  We're still on the air?  I know, right?  Oh.  What happened?  He didn't want to say Iraq was fat.  Yeah, I know.  But he's implying you would need a digging crane.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't dig a big hole for Eric.  No?  No, I would just fucking burn his body and piss on it. 
[00:56:00]  Jesus.  Holy fuck.  Chipper.  All right.  That should have been the out cue so we could go to the bathroom.  They tried to take me to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black.  But when I come back, you won't know, no, no.  I ain't got the time.  If my daddy thinks I'm fine.  He's trying to take me to go to rehab. 
[00:56:30]  I won't go, go, go.  I'd rather be at home with Ray.  I ain't got 70 days.  Because there's nothing, nothing you can teach me  that I can learn from Mr. Hathaway. 
[00:57:00]  Did I hear it?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  On Sirius XM.  We should do a montage of the first things we say  when these mics go on.  We should do a montage of the first things  or the first things when these mics go on.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  Because even after all these years,  it's just dumb little noises. 
[00:57:30]  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:00:30]  How old was she for real?  Yeah right  She's only in her late 30s I guess  No  She's been off the air how many years now?  She's probably mid 40s though  Right?  Wait how old is she now?  87  I'm trying to figure out when the Brady Bunch went off the air  Say 72, 73 maybe?  She was in her 40s  72, 28, 41 years ago  41 years ago  So she was 40  Yeah mid 40s that was it

[01:02:00]  But two days ago  The woman that runs it for him  Just up and eloped  I'd be taking over for her  Wait wait pause  Oh  So she has a chance to like  Work at a dress shop  But in the end  She's gonna fucking continue  Washing out their underwear  Right  What the fuck?  Because she's the maid  But what  Why would that be a better job?  Because she's with the Bradys  What terrible dialogue  Oh it's hard  Here's why I might have to leave  There's not a death  Well my Uncle Winston 
[01:02:30]  Has a great dress shop  And the gal who was doing it  Uppity loped  What a non  Horrible  What a non-issue  Yeah  There's not a real problem  Uncle Winston didn't get sick  Why didn't the girl who was doing it  Get fucking her  You know  Cancer with a fallopian tube  Because it's a nice little sitcom  Exactly  It's just shit  It's supposed to be just a nice little  Silly sitcom  Nothing bad  Nothing  The worst thing was  You know  Greg was caught smoking  That's right  Let's see what happens  At least for a minute  I'm dying here 
[01:03:00]  It's escapism  Yeah  Yeah that really  Sounds like a very good job Alice  Oh  I could earn quite a bit of money  Is Alice working them  For some more cash  Yeah  It would be a terrific opportunity  Well  You know we'd never stand in your way  Of course it's not just the money  I mean it's family  My Uncle Winston  You know  Uncle Winston  Uncle Winston  You're like a member of our family  We all love you very much  Even the name stinks  I love all of you too  Oh boy  I promised I'd leave right away  Sensitive music  Yeah

[01:04:00]  And she was like  Oh well  I'm not needed here anymore  So it wasn't about the money in the end  And then the mother is doing some things  No  She felt  So she's just like  Nah I'm going to get the fuck out of here  Fuck you Bradys  You know what happened was  Greg had left  Greg had a rubber cock  That he would stick in the Jensen girl's backside  And Alice found it  Yeah  And she was rolling it  And got dust all over it  And Greg was saying to Peter and Jan  That cunt got dust all over my shit covered plastic dick  And Alice overheard them 
[01:04:30]  And they're like  No no no  That's not what I meant  Jesus  I'm just throwing it over the cliff  It all ends quite nicely  It is  Uncle Winston is arrested for pedophilia  And child pornography peddling  And it's not a dress shop  It's called blowing Bobby's little penis  His little pee-pee  In the fucking bike shop  That's how Cousin Oliver was introduced  He was pulled bleeding from the anus  And weeping out of the dress shop 
[01:05:00]  I say  Wow  Wow  Wow  And then they rescued him  Yes  Yes they did  We're not going to listen to the rest of the clip  Are we  I want to hear the whole episode  What happened  She stays  Yes of course  She stays  She realizes she's still needed  Yes she realizes after she has to bring broth  And take the little dog for a walk with Mr. Brady  Wash his robe  Wow this is 87  He got A  He certainly did 
[01:05:30]  Is she still a religious broad  Yeah  She went all cult and shit I think  She did  She went all in  Who was the Brady kid that recently was talking about Mr. Brady  Saying that his gay lifestyle killed him  Oh yeah  It was Marsha  I'm going to guess  Is it Marsha  Marsha  Marsha  I don't think it was Marsha  Marsha  Marsha  Marsha  Was it Cindy  It was Cindy  Cindy Brady  Cindy's a religious broad  A tough broad  He said that it was his gay lifestyle  That gave him the  Well you know  It probably was 
[01:06:00]  Not the fault of his gay lifestyle  He didn't know at the time  I guess  Yeah but she was twisting it to say  You know  You gotta listen to the Lord  Really?  Is that what you're saying?  I believe so  Oh why doesn't she shut the fuck up?  Does she think it was another one of the Lord's plagues  Put upon the gay community?  Where the Lord really helped your fucking career  After the Brady Bunch  Yeah she didn't really do anything  No  Baby talk baby talk  It's a wonder you can walk  What'd she say?  Sam 
[01:06:30]  Sam  You're close to the reading  He never allowed himself to have a genuine love  He was forever taunted by his own disdain  For natural inclinations that he was born with  She wrote  Bob was a family man  Olsen wrote  Had he been allowed to form a relationship with another man  He would have been the best husband ever  And might still be alive  But Bob could not be at peace with this  Because the people surrounding him  Shoved their own judgment down his throat  And sadly  Well it wasn't the judgment  And that's not the throat 
[01:07:00]  Yeah  Oh so this is completely different than we were  Oh my god  We threw her under the bus  Yes we did  She's completely  She's sticking up for him  Defending him  Yeah  Okay good  Alright  Yeah everybody around him wasn't into the gay  Right  So he was  He had a very probably  You know  His lifestyle was very loose  He played it very loosey-goosey  And she's saying  If people were more accepting back then  He'd have just had a boyfriend 
[01:07:30]  A husband  And a husband or something  He would have settled down  And he wouldn't have fucking  You know  Been taking so much dick in his ass  Jesus  Why?  What?  It's probably hard not to though  If you're single and Mr. Brady  Oh god  It's amazing  Nobody outed him back then though  Like it may  It's really  Fucking how quiet gay guys are  Again  People didn't out Liberace  Yeah  Like Liberace  Was like  Oh  Well Lee  We talk about it all the time  Yeah  He'd be on the talk shows 
[01:08:00]  And he'd be like  Special woman in your life Lee  Well I'm always looking  Looking  Yeah  I think Johnny Carson  Kind of played with that a little bit  Yeah  He was basically telling his audience  Look  I'm playing my role here  But we all know what's going on  With Liberace  It was really never  But he  I remember Carson had some undertones  About the whole thing  Yeah  But the housewives and stuff  That loved it  They would just watch and be  Well you know  It's very hard to find a girl  As good as mother 
[01:08:30]  Really?  Lee?  Can we get some Liberace clips today?  Some Lee  There's that movie coming out I guess  Yes  With  Michael Douglas  Matt Damon and Michael Douglas  And Tom Papa  Isn't Tom Papa in that one?  Tom Papa is in that one  He's a big role  He plays Liberace's manager  Wow  And yeah I gotta see that  I've seen some of the trailers for it and stuff  Who's playing Liberace again?  Michael Douglas  Oh okay  He does a great fucking job  Really?  Looks like the guy  Does he really?  Crazy yeah  You'd never think  Can we see Mike Douglas 
[01:09:00]  Is this it Sam?  No  If you could find any clip  Where Liberace's talking about the ladies  That would be great  Maybe Mike Douglas Liberace  Or Merv Liberace  Maybe even some Johnny Carson  Behind the Candelabra  Is the movie  Oh this is the movie?  Yeah  When is that coming out soon?  It was going to be called  A Candelabra in my behind  But they decided  Oh my god  That's Michael Douglas?  Right?  Wow  Isn't that fucked up?  Yeah they  Wow  This is creepy  They're doing some movie magic  Making them look a lot younger 
[01:09:30]  You want to turn this down?  I want to hear how Michael Douglas sounds  As Lee  I want to be everything to you Scott  I want to be father, brother, lover, best friend  I'll do whatever you want  I want you to make Scott look like this  Him  You will make me feel so young  Why would a grown man want to adopt another grown man?  So we can be family 
[01:10:00]  All I do is give and give and give  I can't live like this  You're being paranoid  Scott  Are you still  I'm not  I'm upset  Don't change the subject  I don't even have my own face  Wow  Wow, yeah  Who's Tom Papa?  HBO films  Matt Damon  They dressed him up in this flamboyant fucking  Dan Aykroyd's in that?  Jesus  Rob Lowe 
[01:10:30]  Debbie Reynolds  Fuck  It's a great cast  Yeah, this is supposed to be really good  Who's even been closer to me  Than this young man?  Oh, they're in the tub together drinking champagne  Behind the candelabra  Wow, Jesus  Wow  It looks good  That looks really good  Absolutely  Yeah  Lee  Just call me Lee  I like how they dress him up like a flamboyant chauffeur  That's great 
[01:11:00]  By the way, we have no update on the channel change  Everyone was in a tizzy yesterday  What update?  It's happening  No, no, it's not happening  What?  What?  What happened?  What?  What's the matter?  I was reading shit about fucking  Well, I finally gave  I finally gave everybody the SiriusXM Twitter account 
[01:11:30]  And the Sirius  I think it's SiriusXM help Twitter account  Yeah  Just so they could see  What we have to deal with every fucking day  Yeah  Because they were all tweeting their fucking problems  They're having with the service  I mean, you got the idiots that have to say folk you  And this and that  But then you had actual people with real concerns going  Well, am I going to get Opie and Anthony  When you change the, you know  Make the channel switch?  Because I don't get 103 in my current unit  Why am I paying for this?  Why can't I get this?  What's going on here?  I mean, the issues are unbelievable 
[01:12:00]  That's my biggest concern  Some older units might not get it, right?  Yeah, that's my biggest concern  I don't know  That's what some people are saying  Is if people can't actually get the fucking show  We get complaints every single day on our Twitter account  So I finally just gave them the, you know  The Twitter accounts of the company  So they could fully understand our frustration  Because our fans are frustrated  With a lot of the things that go on  Yeah, I don't fucking  I don't know  Because I was reading shit last night from people saying 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah, I don't get it  And then somebody in customer service was telling people  That they might have to change their radios  Right  Like, what does that mean?  I was telling you before the show  If any one of us took our Twitter account  And said, you know, fuck that Twitter account  I'm going to start a new Twitter account  But we're going to promote the fuck out of it  That, you know, I'm not Opie Radio anymore  Or you're not Anthony Comey anymore  There's no way you would come close to having the same followers  That's just how it works in the end  So when you move a show to another channel 
[01:13:00]  You're absolutely going to lose listeners  Yep, we're going to lose listeners because of this channel change  And we're not necessarily going to get them all back  Exactly  We've got a good percentage of them back  But in the end, we're going to lose listeners  Because these guys have decided to reorganize the channels  It's just stupid  How is that a good thing?  They've not fucked with Howard's channels once  No, no  How many times have we been moved?  It should be the second time  Second time?  You sure it's only the second?  Yeah  What were we originally?  I don't even know anymore 
[01:13:30]  XM202, Sirius 197  Oh, right  202, 197  Then we went to 105, 206  And now we're going to 103, 206?  Depending on  Because it goes  First we were XM202  Then we came over here  And instead of being Sirius 202  We became XM202, Sirius 197  That's the first channel change  Okay  And even back then  They should have just put us on both  Whatever  Then the channel change  We went over this yesterday  I know  I'm just giving people an update  That, you know, you could fucking tweet these guys  We are going to lose listeners  That's very frustrating  Of course we are  One plus in this whole thing 
[01:14:00]  Studio 54  Will be on channel 54  I just, you know  Thank God for that  Thank God they took care of that channel  Thank God for that  I have a feeling we had something to do with that  Pointing out how ridiculous that one was  You can't have a Studio 54 channel  And not put it on 54  Oh, exactly  If this show had that kind of power  We probably wouldn't be moving to 103, though  That's true  We don't have any power  We need some juice  Yesterday I did not have 103  Now I have it  So, I don't know  Maybe they're reprogramming radios

[01:22:00]  Like you know  You take a few days  You don't drink  But then after that  I decided to just see  How long I could  You know  Let this go  But he heard  Sick not drink  That's what Laszlo heard  In his fucking  His mind all full of  GTA 5 stuff  So um  Yeah  Nah I just figured  I'd fucking  22 days in  I don't know  Three weeks  Whatever  Three weeks  It uh  I just know  Because you said  On a Thursday  It was  It was  22 days then

[01:23:30]  Like I said  After the first  Couple of drinks  Once you have  That initial buzz  The rest of the night  It's just  You're just  Lifting a beverage  Up to your face  The whole time  And you don't really  Get any more  Out of it  You've got to  Keep drinking  So you don't  Get a headache  And then you've got  A big hangover  The next day  Are you worried  That you're going  To end up  Getting drunk  And then accidentally  Shooting your  Velociraptor  That was a concern  What the fuck is that  That was a concern  Unload into it  Take off its head  Yeah 
[01:24:00]  I honestly though  Haven't taken any break  From drinking  Since I started drinking  That's a long  Fucking time  It really is  A long time  Roll  So just the plain  Thought of seeing  How you could  If you could even  Do it  You know  If it's one of those  Things where it's like  Oh my god  I gotta  Like what  What the big  Like  Will it be  I'll go crazy

[01:42:00]  Because I didn't really  Follow the Islanders  This year  A little bit  I went to two games  And uh  Yeah  They're playing the Penguins  And the Penguins  Just kicked their ass  Oh penguins  Down the ice  The other night  Five zip  Penguins  Again out  So I don't know  Everyone's excited  That the Islanders  Are finally back  In the playoffs  Yeah  First time  In I don't know  I think  I want to say  Six seven years  Probably  Yeah  While  Are we on our  Drive for five  Oh no  No no no  No they forgot

[01:44:00]  Fucker  Go  A guy  Was right  On top  Of him  Yeah  It looks like  He did the  Damage when  His face  Hit the ice  Yeah  I think  He hit him  Because I  Don't think  He hit him  In the head  The guy  Was kind  Of  Just a  Good solid  Check  The guy  Went down  Immediately  And face  First  Hit the ice  Yeah  The guy  Eller  And he  Was bleeding  They show  His profusely  Bleeding face  On the ice  Some other  Fractures in  His face  I believe  Look at that  They're not saying  Is he a wreck  Is he his teeth  Knocked out  I don't know 
[01:44:30]  I know that's  From the nose  Mostly  The initial blood  Or probably  All the blood  Was from the  Broken nose  But then they're  Saying there's  Some other  Fractures in his  Fucking face  Yeah  Yeah  Lars Eller  Was the one  That  Got hit  How did he  Actually  Was it on purpose  That guy  Knocked him down  No  But  They were  Making out  It's a tough call  Because it's a  Legal hit  Oh right  Right on the  Yeah  His fucking face  Hits the ice  Face plant  Why can't they  Invent soft ice  I don't get it 
[01:45:00]  And he was out  I don't know  If he was knocked out  Or just in  Just tremendous pain  That he didn't  Want to fucking move  He didn't move  For a little bit  Probably was out  Right  He was knocked  The fuck out  He was knocked out  It almost looked like  He got knocked out  In some way shape or form  From the hit  Itself  And that's why  His face hit the  Oh my god  The ice  He wasn't even  Able to block it  Oh  Oh  Brian  Uh oh  Go ahead  Welcome aboard  Go ahead  Hey  I think the only  Game is tonight  Not tomorrow

[01:46:00]  Now you can go  Sorry Brian  I was ready to  Fucking rip your head off  Look what I do here  Sorry about that  Alright  Bye  Brian's right  I'm wrong  Again  Let's talk about  Reese Witherspoon  Reese Witherspoon  She and her  I guess her boyfriend  Husband  What is it  I don't know  Is it married  So the hubby  Was driving home  They were at some event  They got their drink on  And they had their drink on  Right  I think it was drank on  Drank on  You have to say drank on  Yeah I think so 
[01:46:30]  And they get pulled over  You know  They're giving the husband  The what have you  For a dewey  It happens  Yeah  And then Reese Witherspoon  Decides she's going to  Get out of the car  And have a little conversation  With the cops  And tell everyone  Who she is  Yeah  That she's Reese Witherspoon  Well at first they just said  Hey lady get back in the car  You know  And I guess  She was being a little combative  She got back in the car  But then she gets back out again  And starts giving the cops  A how do you do 
[01:47:00]  And they had to give her  Some of the what of it  Yeah  And what I'm thinking  When I see something like this  This is really how  Reese Witherspoon is  Yes  Stop with the statement she gave  But these big Hollywood stars  They portray this image  To the public  And when they go on  These talk shows  Right  Right  But this is the real  Reese Witherspoon  Hi I'm Reese Witherspoon  Because you're going to hear  A very different  Reese Witherspoon  Yes  Which explains what happened  That night  And yes 
[01:47:30]  They placed her under arrest  They sure did  What a drunken ass  Yeah  She was hammied  Her husband was hammied  Trying to use her name  To get out of it  Yeah  And the cop wants  No part of it  Alright  Maybe we've done that too  But we're polite about it  At least  Not to that extent  Once you're out of the car  All bets are off man  Like through the window  I'll fucking bargain  Like I'm at a  Bangladesh marketplace  But  If I'm out of the vehicle  Yeah  The bargaining's over 
[01:48:00]  You're fucking  You know  That's it  You are now  Now you're in a position  Where  The officer can feel  Threatened by you  Right  You know  You could be in his space  Sure  There's a lot of things  That can happen  When you're out of the car  I've seen so many videos  Where  The cop will  Grab someone by the arm  And then you hear like  Don't touch me  Right  Get your  Don't you  And they pull away  It's over at that point  Fucking arrest it  When we were really hot  Back in the day  I remember that 
[01:48:30]  You still are  Oh thank you Jimmy  I'm working on it  I was on the  Henry Hudson Parkway  I was going about  75 or 80  Got pulled over  This is when we had  Heat man  Ah yes  We had heat in this town  Oh yeah  I know it's hard to believe  But we did  Oh yeah  And I had so many  God damn PBA cards  And this guy  That pulled me over  He was so happy  He had somebody  Going 75, 80  Ah  He was so happy  Yeah  Just giving me the business  And then  I politely said  Would you accept 
[01:49:00]  A PBA card  And he goes  Who do you know  It wasn't even nice about it  Who do you know  So I just  I swear to you  I handed him a whole bunch  Remember the days  We would get one  Every other week  Take one of these  Flatfoot  Pick one  So I basically  Gave him a handful  Like four or five  Easy  Yeah  And then he goes  Wait here  And he goes back  To his patrol car  And I'm like  Fuck I don't know  If the PBA card  Is going to work  You know  He comes back  To the window  And he throws  Him at me  And goes  And goes  Be careful 
[01:49:30]  Next time  Or be more careful  He was so mad  That he was  Letting me off the hook  Yeah  Yeah  He wanted  Because whatever name  I had in that pile  Was a good one  Yeah  Now he's got to sit there  And wait for another  He was so pissed  And he  And he couldn't help himself  He could  You know  He didn't throw him  But he kind of  Tossed him back  Into my lap  Yeah  So  That's when we used  To have heat  Yeah  Now I'm a 10 and 2 guy  Because I know  No one's going to help me out  And drive nice  There was a time man  I just knew 
[01:50:00]  We would get out of  Every fucking ticket  And we did  But I'll tell you though  Driving back from my brother's house  Last Sunday  Again  I go there  I'm drinking fucking  Some Perrier  Right  And shit  A little lime  A little lime or no lime  No no lime  Just a little Perrier  That's too bad  And now I'm leaving  It's after dinner  And everything  And I got the Mustang  I'm driving like a fucking asshole  Really  I'm  Weaving in and out of traffic 
[01:50:30]  Are you one of those  Weaving in and out guys  When you're in the Mustang  If I look 5, 10 cars ahead  And I see his space  And I see a little room  Opening up in the middle lane  And by the time I get there  I'll be able to swing in  Sweep around the right lane  Go up  Boom  All the way back to left  I'm that guy  I'm doing the moves  Especially in that car  It's fun  You know  But if I had been drinking  I would have  Set the cruise control  To 58  I'd have fucking  Been in the center lane  Just driving 10 and 2 
[01:51:00]  In fucking third gear  The whole way home  The whole way fucking home  But  I'm like  I'm not gonna get a Dewey  I don't care  I'll get a ticket  Whatever  If I do  But uh  How fast did you get it up to?  Like 120  Did you really?  Yes  That scares the fuck out of me  I'm not even gonna sit  Well it should  Fuck in front  Well it should  I got  I got that dumb car  They rented us  Lent us  Back in the day  A little over 100  And it scared me  They call me a wimp 
[01:51:30]  I don't give a fuck  I don't like going that fast  Fuck that  It's so fucking  You're not scared at all?  On the LIE?  Gets you a little shaky  I only do it during those stretches  Where there's no one there  Right  Like you'll get out of one  You just open it up a little bit  One bunch of traffic  And then you'll see way ahead  Is another bunch of traffic  Right  And there's that empty spot  For some reason  I don't know how that forms  On a highway  I think it's because  It's that space  Where there's three lanes wide  Of assholes  In front of everybody  That's some David Copperfield shit 
[01:52:00]  Yeah  So you pop out of that traffic  And then I fucking  You know  What about the deer?  See the boost go up  What about the deer?  That's pretty far out east  Nah  It's going to be a blown tire  Why don't you stop doing that shit?  Well I don't do it a lot  Good  I do it every once in a while  When I can open it up  As they say  You gotta open it up  Yeah  It's fucking crazy  You really got up to 120  Yeah  How does that feel?  It feels cool as fuck  And no nervousness 
[01:52:30]  No fucking  No it's an exhilaration  Right  It's not really a nervousness  You do think like  Oh boy  This is a machine  It could just break  But  Yeah  What are you going to do?  You know  Wow  Anyway  It leads us to  Reese Witherspewn  Reese Witherspewn  We got  We got the dash cam footage  All over the place  Most people have seen this already  But we'll at least try to make it  Yeah  I don't know  Better  Yeah  Maybe there'll be a fucking joke in here  Or something  Who knows  That's uh

[02:10:00]  You're right  I've had black people at my house  Oh that's terrible  Oh god  She's so out of touch  We all know fucking police officers  Some of my best friends know gay people  What's the matter Joe?  I like the fact that she said  I'm pregnant  Oh that's not even in the audio  And it's not even good  Because you're drunk you dummy  It means you're drinking and pregnant  But she didn't  It's not in the  She didn't have to tell us that  She never had to say that  Yeah  Tipped her little hand there  Sounds to me like she had one too many at dinner  Oh you think so?  Oh yeah 
[02:10:30]  Maybe two too many  I think  Sober  Slow on booze  Enjoy the road  Ugh  Is that abusive?  Is there more of it?  Boy regular Joe is just alone at parties  Isn't he?  Just walks over to a little group  Starts chit chatting  And they  They all just slowly walk away  I don't go to parties  I'm busy working  I tuck my shirt into my chinos  And I just sit back and relax  Chinos  Regular Joe always says  Look the wrong cliche is going to  Yes  Yes  Oh god I hate regular Joe  Respectful to him  And I have police officers in my family 
[02:11:00]  Yuck  I work with police officers every day  I know better  Every day?  It's just unacceptable  Have you had any contact with the police there?  Absolutely  Yeah  Yesterday  You know I spoke to them  And again just said  You know there's no reason to be disrespectful  I think all I can say is  I was just panicked  No hammered  Yeah you weren't panicked  Not panicked  That wasn't panicked  Right  Panicked it'd be  Oh my god  What are you taking it?  Right right right  Please let me know  What the process is  To take care of this  I'm in a panic  Not  You know my name? 
[02:11:30]  Eh?  Ever see Legally Blonde?  She's loaded  I played a hot lawyer in that one  So let me  Let me  Give you a little legal advice officer  Yeah  All right  Okay  One more clip  Believe it or not  Well one final question  And a lot of people want to know this  As well  You talk about the big lesson learned  I think one of the hardest things  For anyone caught in a situation like this  Is how do you talk to your kids  About it  Your name or your children  Oh god  I have to say that  Are you serious? 
[02:12:00]  One of the hardest things  Is me running a political show on Sundays  And then having to do this interview  On Tuesday  Yes  Yes  Right  How do you talk to your kids?  How do you talk to your kids?  Well I do a couple of shots  And then I tell them  Hey  Do as I say  Not as I do  You just talk to them  Ridiculous  That was a good one of my dad's  By the way  What?  When they'd be like  Well I see you doing that  You know like  Don't smoke  I see you smoking  Do as I say  Not as I do  All right  Stalin 
[02:12:30]  Jesus  That doesn't work in the end  No  It's like setting an example  Dad  You're supposed to set a fucking example  Learn it from you  You can't just say  Do as I say  Not as I do  Oh okay  All right  I'll use the fucking  I'll use the Mexican landscaper  As a fucking example  Right  At least he's working  Breakfast club  What about you?  Yeah  Dad  Dad  Smoke up  Ugh  You like that scene  With Judd  Do she  You like when Judd Nelson  Had his crazy meltdown 
[02:13:00]  Let's get that  Ready to go after the fucking  Reese with a spewn on you  Hey  Hey  Hey  Chad  What about you?  All right  One thing at a time  Let's get past the Reese with a spewn  Your kids are out of your older children  I have to say  That's the hardest part about it  No it's not  Just  Having to tell our kids  And you know 
[02:13:30]  Just embarrassed  That's the hardest part  And we have to say  When you make a mistake  You take responsibility  I'm not going to court  And we are taking responsibility  And doing everything  Now you are  To make it right  You found out they were recording  You know  You just have to be honest with them  And that was definitely  The hardest part  She's so full of it  She is so full of it  But you know the important thing here  So full of shit  Everyone's focusing on the fact  That she got lippy  Her husband was driving drunk  Right  Yes  Right  That's a little more  Lack of judgment-y  Than you fucking 
[02:14:00]  Saying some shit to the cops  You Hollywood jizzbag  Stephanopoulos  This lip  She wasn't even that bad  She was slightly cunty  Right  Not surprising for a hot blonde  Sure  Her husband  Was barreling down the street  Driving drunk  Liquored up  And that's the bigger story  That's the story  But he's not famous  So they don't give a fuck  Right  Her mouthing off to the cops  Isn't going to kill somebody  Potentially  Right  Yeah  The drunk at the wheel  Good point  Different story  The story is he was drunk driving  Yes  And the lessons learned  There's so many lessons learned 
[02:14:30]  So many  Let's see if we can guess the lessons  Alright  Number one  Uh huh  Um  Don't be disrespectful  No number one is  That's number two  Number one is  Don't drink and drive  Always know your limit  No  How about number one  Get personalized plates  That say  Risswoodspin  So they know  Yeah  So then they'll know  And they don't have to say  Right from the get go  Do you know why  Right 
[02:15:00]  Wait  R-S-W  Risswoodspin  R-S-P-N  I'm Risswoodspin  Yeah  It's learned  You know  Um  Absolutely  And you know  I will  I will  Always  Oh she's not going to listen  When a police officer tells you  To stay in the car  You stay in the car  Stay in the car  I learned that for sure  Stay on the boat  You know  I think I've played a lawyer  In a movie so many times  I think I am a lawyer  Wow you said that  And clearly I'm not a lawyer  She's good nature  That's the Riss we know and love 
[02:15:30]  That's her  Making everyone laugh  Laughing the world  Laughs to let you Riss  Yeah  She's adorable  She's just making everyone laugh  Yeah  At the interview  I thought I was a lawyer  That's the one we know and love so much  Alright we love you again  We love you  Adorable  Yeah  Jesus  You're alright  Yeah  Alright  Fucking drive drunk  If you have to  I played a tranny serial killer  I guess I thought I was a tranny serial killer 
[02:16:00]  We're good  We're good  It doesn't give you an excuse  Yeah  Cause she  And she wasn't even saying anything legal like  She's just like  I'm an American  And you can't arrest me  And then as they're cuffing her  She's going  You're harassing me  This is harassment  No it's an arrest  There's a difference  She really did a lot of research for that role as a lawyer  Yeah  Yeah  Oh god  Awful  Oh Reese  She's so great and flucky 
[02:16:30]  Alright  She is  Get over here  The husband's drunk behind the wheel  Flying down the highway  Yeah  Did you hear this  I was panicked  Did you hear the story about the fucking pizza place in Brooklyn that wouldn't serve  That's a fake story  Oh is that fake  Yeah I tweeted that and I got killed last night  Oh yeah  I got killed so bad I turned off my Twitter  You did  I was heating up I was so embarrassed  I read it  And I was so embarrassed  While I was reading it I'm like  What  And then the part where it said that Bloomberg turned around and said what the fuck 
[02:17:00]  Right  Oh I didn't get to that part  It's like no he didn't  He didn't say what the fuck  That Bloomberg was in a pizza place with another guy and they were going over some shit  Another guy it was  Yeah  And they were having some pizza  And they got a slice of pizza and he wanted more so he goes  Sir you know behind the counter can I have another slice  And the guy was like no you've had your limit  Ah  It's the soda band  The soda band  So then it said that Bloomberg thought he was joking  And said hey I'm fucking hungry here give me another one

[02:32:00]  This is great  I can't believe it  Worked out this way  What was that?  Do you feel like  Cinco de Mayo  Is losing some of  Its national punch?  This show feels so racist  Right now  With the music in the back  Really?  Oh my god  Traditional Mexican food  And some traditional  Mexican music  Right  I love Mexico  I used to  My dad used to  Take me to Tijuana 
[02:32:30]  When we used to live  In San Juan Capistrano  My dad would take me  Down to Tijuana  And  It was interesting  I liked it  Very colorful  Did you buy souvenirs?  No  Because the second  You brought money out  A bunch of kids  Would come running up  And they asked  You for it  And then there were  Horses painted like  Zebras  It was cool though  I bought a big  Ceramic bowl  And brought it across  The border  The border guy 
[02:33:00]  Wanted to know  What was in it  I was like  It's a piggy bank  I just paid more  Attention to my dad  He's hammered  Would he drink in Tijuana?  Oh would he ever  Tequila  Wow  Yeah  Our Tijuana trips  Are legendary  Even though he had to drive?  Oh yeah  He didn't care  Dad would drink and drive  At the same time  Like with a beer  I remember once  He had a beer in one hand  He had his CB mic 
[02:33:30]  In the other  With the cord  And his hand on the wheel  With the CB mic  And then he tried  To make a turn  And wind his hand around  He got literally  Wrapped up in the CB cord  And the beer  Started spilling  And we're going  Into another lane  And he was hammered  Did you ever take his beer  And dump it out the window  And say this is really  Irresponsible  Oh yeah  Sure  Sure  What are you kidding?  That would have been death  Where would he drink in Tijuana?  Like on the street  Or would he bring you  Into like scary bars?  It would be in scary bars  Yeah yeah  There was some scary bars 
[02:34:00]  It's Tijuana  And you were just  A girl doing the sex show  Was younger than me  On the stage  How old was  Fantastic  How old were you?  I was probably 13  Around there  And you just sit at the bar?  And I would just sit at the bar  Or if they didn't let me sit at the bar  I'd sit at a table  Because it was like  A bar restaurant thing  And he would just  Drive in right?  Oh yeah  We would drive in  And then  And drive out  Were you worried about  Your car getting stolen?  Or wasn't he worried back then  About getting ripped off?  I heard in Tijuana  You'd get ripped off for it  No I don't think he cared 
[02:34:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Dad didn't really  Think much about it  You're making someone  Very uncomfortable  No this is my experience  In Tijuana  She's very uncomfortable  Oh I know  She's trying to figure out  How the fuck to get out of here  Why?  Why?  No it was a lot of fun  Yeah  But I remember  It was very dangerous  Like some of the roads  Through San Diego  Yeah  Where you know  The cliffs there and stuff  You know  And we'd be driving this truck  And my dad was hammered  And I'm just looking over  Like I used to love red lights 
[02:35:00]  I was  Like now I hate it  But I used to drive  With my dad  And then there'd be a red light  And it was the time  Where I could go  And breathe again  I could breathe a little  And I'm like  Fuck  And then like green  I would just tense up again  For the whole fucking ride  And I'm like  Leaning my body  Trying to steer the truck  Like  Away from the cliff  Away from an  Like a big cement  Conrock truck  Is rumbling down the road  And he's drifting 
[02:35:30]  Into that lane  Because he's drinking it  He's on his CV  And if I even said like  Dad, dad  He'd be like  I see it  God damn it  Tell me  I'm like  Oh god  Oh  Oh red light  How far was it  Green  That was terrible  How far right was it  It was like  What's it from  San Diego  Or from  It was between  LA and San Diego  Capistrano  Like two and a half  Three  Yeah it was probably  A couple hours  Oh you were taking long drives  Oh fuck it  Dude 
[02:36:00]  We used to go to  Lake Elsinore  From Capistrano  And that's over  The Ortega Highway  It's like a movie road  Where it's just  On the edge of a cliff  The entire way  And it's all windy  Jesus  And it was  It was horrifying  And you'd get in those  Lines to go through  Customs  Like that  Yeah yeah  That was going to  Mexico  Yeah it was  We'd get on the line  To go through  Customs  They wouldn't give a shit  He'd be happy  How you doing today  And he was the one  That always thought 
[02:36:30]  He was like  The big flirter  When he was drunk  So it was like  Hi little lady  That's what they want to hear  Yeah woman  Is that  I remember once  He was like  You got a complexion  Like peaches and cream  We'd sit on the line  It's like  Oh god  Dad  Stop it  Would you be embarrassed  Oh yes  But why were you guys  Going down there  It was just a week  Like a Saturday thing to do  It's lawless  Go down there  Yeah  What time would you go  It was early in the morning  We would leave  Oh okay 
[02:37:00]  So we'd be there  For the afternoon  And part of the evening  We'd probably head back  About seven  And stuff  So it was a full day  Back when it was dark  Back on the cliff road  Yeah  Oh yeah  The dark night time  Was just a horror show  It was just  I was tense  The whole ride  Clutching your bowl  Oh it was horrible  And by the way  It was a shift truck  Oh no  So he was  And it was on the column  That's right  So he's driving  CB beer  Shifting  Trying to steer 
[02:37:30]  Old blue  The lab  Was in the fucking  Back of the truck  Oh god  Yeah  So you'd have to watch him  Because the poor dog  Is ready to jump out of the truck  It was just  It was so much anxiety  For me  My trip to Tijuana  Was so much anxiety  I love the picture of you  In the bar  All creepy characters  And smoky  And you're just sitting there  Yeah  They were like  A little kid  You're sitting there  The mariachi band 
[02:38:00]  Would be playing  And I'd just be sitting there  And dad's at the bar  Like  Yeah  Another tequila  Yeah  And I'm just sitting there  And he'd look back  What do you need  Another coke  He's like  Yeah  People's guns  Sticking out their pockets  Would he talk to people  Or interact with people  Oh yeah  Yeah  He was very social  Yeah  A couple of times  Downstairs from the Franciscan  It was a place called  The Franciscan  And that was in Capistrano  I guess  I guess we were leaving 
[02:38:30]  And we had a bunch of friends and stuff  All drunk and everything  And he was leaving the parking garage  Which was underneath the Franciscan  And his truck blew a lot of smoke  So he stepped on the gas  And smoke blew out  And a bunch of these tourists  And they hated  If you lived in Capistrano  Because the swallows always come back  And they got the mission there  So there were tourists everywhere  And if you lived there  You hated the fucking tourists  So he stepped on the gas  And a bunch of black smoke  Came out of the exhaust  And these tourists were like  Hey you fucking asshole  Fuck you  And my father was like  Fuck me 
[02:39:00]  Fuck you  And everyone gets out of the truck  And like  Now I'm out of the truck  So I'm probably 14  Maybe 13  14 years old  And I'm standing there  With these big drunk men  And these other tourist guys  And they're like  Yeah you fucking asshole  Fuck you  And I'm like  Oh Jesus Christ  So one of these guys  One of my father's friends  Throws his cigarette pack  At one of his other friends  He goes  Hold these Finney  And he goes to hold them  Because he's going to 
[02:39:30]  Clock this guy in the head  And the tourist  Just pounded him in the face  And my father's  One of my father's friends  Down already  You saw your dad get beat up  No it was one of my father's friends  Got beat up  He got beat up  So then it was on  And at that point  Two guys come running after me  Because I'm the little fucking guy  Oh no  So I'm like  Whoa  I'm hightailing it  You didn't fight  Why would I fight  Because I didn't want to be there  This grown up's coming for me  Yeah  And it was two of them  Well my dad turned around  And I grabbed one of them  And then the other guy 
[02:40:00]  Like I guess he  You know  I ran up the stairs  And that was it  But then I went back downstairs  And the cops were there  And they put everybody  Against the wall  So we're all just  Kind of leaning  Against the wall  And I'm looking over  And my father's there  And there's Hal Finney  With his fucking eye all bloody  And I'm like  Oh this was a great night  We were leaving  Hal Finney  Hal Finney  It was Hal Finney  The cutters  Yeah  The cutters are in trouble again  Oh it was crazy  Yeah  What does this have to do  With her tacos? 
[02:40:30]  I don't know  Well I ate a lot of tacos  So definitely you need to go  And try Los Feliz tacos  Enjoy you know  Some dinner  And then go and  Go crazy at the lounge  And drink some of our  150 kinds of tequilas  And mezcal  And you can fight  Like Anthony's dad  Right  Right  He brought that shit  Right around  She's impressive  Yeah  Anything from the Mad Cuban  Before we wrap up Taco Day?

She got the perfect solution  And you got the final solution  Oh Jesus  Wow  Chip is being a little  Anti-Semitic  Anti-Semitic  I think so  Oh that's good  Because Iraq loves tequila  And he could  He could drink anyone  Under the table  Makes him cry 
[02:42:30]  You don't even know  That he's drunk  Aside from the fact  That he's weeping openly  About people not liking him  Like he's crying  He turns into Halle Berry  Except being Oscar  Alright well  Well this has been great  I still don't know  I still don't know  Where the tacos came from  I'm a little confused  Tijuana right  Why  Tijuana  From Finney  You do not know  Yeah  Hal Finney's taco shop  That ain't the name for me  Finney taco hut 
[02:43:00]  I haven't even thought of Hal Finney in years  I love the fact that Hal Finney got clocked in the eye  Hal Finney was a little bloodied  I don't know but it sounds like he deserved it a little bit  Yeah all of them did  Yeah  That's for sure  Like his fighting prep is hold these  I saw my dad brawl a few times  He always did pretty good for himself  Yeah he never got his ass kicked  I remember when he beat up a Mexican guy  For trying to pick me up at a party  No  Yeah I was hanging out at a party 
[02:43:30]  And it was an outdoor at the stables and stuff  And we were hanging out  And I was drinking some of this home brew that they used to make  And everybody else was  So they were pretty hammered  So I was hanging out  And my dad was talking to his friends  I was probably the same age  Like 13, 14  13, 14  Adorable  Yeah I was adorable  Very molestable  And there was this Mexican guy  And he was all kind of drunk  And he came over near me  But with an earshot of my dad  He goes  Hey how are you doing  I'm like oh good  He's like  You know me and you  Why don't we go into the bushes over here  Oh my god 
[02:44:00]  And my dad came flying across the hood of a truck  That we were standing next to  And just grabbed the guy  And started just pounding his face  Wow  And then the rest of the guys were like  Because obviously he was an uncle or cousin of somebody's  He's like  Joey  Joey  Joey  Wait wait wait  Hold on  He's like  This motherfucker  And he's pounding  And I'm there  What was he going to do to me in the bushes  Hey dad  You cock blocker  Yeah  I was this close to being in the bushes  Yeah but dad didn't want him fucking tapping into his supply

[02:45:00]  Right  Right  That off of the path  Not on my watch  Right  That's not exactly a good inspiring tale of fatherly love  You mean he didn't want you to get fucked in the mouth in the shrubs  Dear old dad  He rolled  I had a lot of fun out there  See we got a lot of fucking Mexican stories  Thanks  Thanks for talking  Yeah  Yeah  Are there bushes at Los Feliz  Yes  Can we go into the bushes

[03:03:00]  And if you want to showcase your stuff  Which I think an intern getting air time  Is like  That's the gold  Holy grail  And he's just like  Here he is  He was just sitting in the other room  What's wrong with him?  What's wrong with you?  Oh boy  Oh  What are we going to do?  Oh god  What are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  Is he looking for a light mic work?  There we go  Crispin Glover is your  Intern  Very good  I don't know 
[03:03:30]  My job is not to Shanghai the show  If you guys don't want to do the bit  We don't have to do the bit  Whoa  Is he the intern or the boss?  Hey  Fucking spider  Where's your box?  Sam threw it down here  Ryan Adams  Had to make room for the tacos  He made a box for his bit  Instead of just using a dumb hat or something  Oh that shows initiative  But it's supposed to go  You're supposed to put in  Asshole of the Week all week long  Right?  Right  Like at any point  You could put it in  So if the box is readily available 
[03:04:00]  Like a suggestion box  Right  But he decided to hide the box all week  That doesn't make any sense  No  And that's because Troy ruins the box  I had to tape it up  Like real tight this time  Has anyone poured anything in the box?  Like liquid?  No  He has to make a new box every week  Because people are destroying the boxes  Well last time  If you remember  Last week  Troy tried to demonstrate  How easy it was to tamper with it  Right  By shoving his hand in  And then tearing out  That's true  He ripped it  It was not very nice 
[03:04:30]  Yeah  Maybe he's the asshole  Maybe  I don't know if it's happened  No one gives a fuck  Like no one's in here voting  The guys in the producer studio want to vote  And I mean I got my votes  I mean it's just like  Last week everybody rushed in to vote  You got your votes in there  No I have them ready  I already know what I want to write  Is there anything in the box at all?  No  There's nothing  He walks around with the box  It's really creepy  It's his signature bit though  Yeah but you don't really need the box for the bet  But he doesn't really understand that 
[03:05:00]  The box is very important to him  Yeah  He fixes it every week  I'm serious  His box  There's just none of the staff are in here  Like interested in  Like everybody loves air time  We're not staying past 10  So if we're doing asshole a week  We gotta go now  10 minutes  We gotta hustle  Let's hustle this shit  Right  How do you do it?  What are you showing the rules?  How do you do it?  How do you get things in the box?  Here are the rules  He's got these little slips of paper  And we write who we think 
[03:05:30]  Out of our group here  Yeah  Out of everyone involved in the program  Who the asshole of the week is  And why they are an asshole  It goes in the box  And then we count  How many votes each person got  And whoever got the most votes  Is asshole of the week  And has to personally read  Why they were asshole of the week  Where's the paper?  Exactly  Where are the papers?  Where are the papers?  Where are the papers?  Where are the pens?  Where are the pens for everybody?  Are we gonna have to pass  One pen? 
[03:06:00]  Oh  Turn off the phone  Sorry, sorry  Oh jeez  Oh my god  What are you doing?  How's the hell?  Oh  Oh boy  I'm sorry  He's ruining the bet  Tom Papa gets to vote  Here's the papers  Okay  Where is the paper?  Where's the pens?  Pass out the papers to everybody  Are people coming in with their votes?  Where's Troy?  If Tom Papa gets to vote  That means he could also be candidate  Sure  Why not?  Why not? 
[03:06:30]  If you dish it out  You gotta take it  I ain't afraid  Nah  I ain't afraid  I ain't afraid  The Cuban's also voting  So he could also be candidate  Hold on, hold on  I might have something  I need a pen  Hold on  Oh  Thank you  Hold on a sec  Oh, what is this?  I'll find out in a sec  Oh, I got a pen  I need a pen  It's not more wider  Underboard ops  And way much lighter  I don't do nothing  I shouldn't be fired  I won't stop beating  Till I expire  When I leave the table  There's no food left

Well there's one called  Pumped Up Tits  I don't know what that is  And then Sympathy for E-Rock  Sympathy for E-Rock  We know  That's the hit  What about Sympathy  That's the hit  Which one do you want to play?  I don't know what that is  But Pumped Up Tits  I think is the one to play  I bet I can guess  What song it's a parody of  Yeah  What song is it?

The votes are in  Oh, asshole of the week time  Yeah, okay 
[03:14:00]  We have a...  Hey, remember, the loser has to read why.  Right.  But you're doing the ones that...  We have a four-way tie for second place.  Gotcha.  Wow.  With one vote, regular Joe.  One man, one vote.  People don't like when you tell them to get back to work.  I guess not.  Yeah, someone lazy probably wrote that. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I'd rather sit around and do nothing.  Yeah, well, I got work to do.  Is there a reason?  No reason.  Oh, no reason.  Yeah, I know the reason.  Missed to sit on your backside all day while I'm out there working.  Another one.  No reason on this one, but I think it's self-explanatory.  It's also tied for second place.  The ones who didn't tell ONA about the channel change.  Okay.  That makes sense.  Anyone owning up to that?  Not telling ONA about the channel change?  People like to say that I was there. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Anyone want to...  Roland?  Jesus.  You wrote that?  I've never seen him laugh so hard.  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland.  Okay.  I think I...  I didn't think this person was a possible nominee, but...  Little Michaela for being a goddamn Tat-O-Tail.  See, I wonder who wrote that.  I don't know.  I don't know who could have written it.  She is, though. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, he's pointing.  And the final tie for second, with one vote.  Again, Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  This says, instead of giving me the third taco after Kenny refused it, he just split  the taco in two.  Who's that?  There's Alan.  Yeah.  Alan.  It might be Alan.  Alan, because, in first place, with a whopping seven votes...  Whoa. 
[03:16:00]  Ladies and gentlemen.  Whoa!  Intern Alan Thicke, he wins again.  Wow.  You really fucked up this week.  Seven votes though this time.  You're winning at your own bit.  This is so strange.  Aren't you glad?  He worked so hard at it.  Asshole of the week.  Now he has to read why he's an asshole.  One away from a dynasty.  There's a lot of them.  Oh.  Let's see.  One more is dynasty.  Dynasty.  What's up?  What's the first word?  It says, uh, it says still can't.  Oh, right, right.  Still can't do what needs to get done after three weeks. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Um...  I bet I can guess who wrote that.  Let's see.  For being Alan and a smelly shithead.  Oh, all right.  Who wrote that one?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Who was that?  That was me.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq?  Iraq.  Let's see.  Intern Alan Thicke, Jr.  He's so slow and doesn't do anything right.  That's me.  That was Sam.  Nice.  Accurate.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  He has no gumption. 
[03:17:00]  No gumption.  Who wrote that?  Well, who else would use the word gumption?  Yeah.  Me.  I was going to also say he has no stick-to-itiveness, but I figured gumption covers it.  Yeah.  Intern Alan Thicke, Jr. for general aloofness.  Aloof?  Aloof.  Aloof.  I believe that was Dr. Gay, based on handwriting analysis.  Oh, okay.  This one just is Alan.  Just a vote.  I'm going to guess the Cuban.  Yeah, I don't know him, but I don't like him. 
[03:17:30]  Good.  Intern Alan, for having trouble finding a YouTube clip that I found in two minutes, and still  not showering, bullshit, I showered last night, see attached photo for further reference  of being an asshole at work.  Oh, he showed his work.  And it is a printed out image of me asleep.  Oh, shit.  But it's Alan asleep with the phone screening thing on.  Right on his head.  Oh, Alan.  Oh, Alan. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, Alan.  Is that humiliating?  That's pretty humiliating.  Yeah, yeah.  That's really humiliating, actually.  I knew I made the right choice.  Right.  Yeah.  Is that it, Sam?  Overwhelming.  Yeah.  Because people are requesting the sympathy song as we go out.  That's it.  Alan is going to need to repair this.  I couldn't get it open.  Your box is broken again.  I couldn't get it.  I had to get the votes out somehow.  You're going to be all right with that?  No.  I'm just going to have to figure out a new way to package these things.  Yeah, because we'll keep doing this. 
[03:18:30]  Didn't shine as bright the second time.  Sorry.  Quite a drop off.  No, no, no.  Find the sympathy song.  Tom Papa, the Kimmel Center next weekend in Philly next Saturday.  Tickets available.  Right?  Yes, sir.  TomPapa.com.  For your tickets.  Big show.  That's a great show.  Nice theater show.  Yeah, it'll be good.  Big show, great show.  Let's go see Tom Papa next weekend.  Thanks, man.  And Jimmy?  Going to Wise Guys.  I'll be in Utah next weekend.  Friday, Saturday.  It's an amazing room.  What are you doing? 
[03:19:00]  I'm doing the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia.  What's Jimmy Kimmel got his own place?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  And I want to thank the taco lady.  Oh, that was good.  Yeah.  Good tacos.  Taco Bell rocks.  What's next Friday?  You got anything going on for the next Friday yet?  I'm going to make Cuban food so you can really be racist next week.  Oh.  It wasn't racist.  It's Cinco de Mayo.  You got to play Mexican music.  That lady looked like her head was going to explode.  She didn't know what she was getting herself into today.  It's a different culture. 
[03:19:30]  Is she all right, Troy?  You know her a little bit, right?  Yeah.  She'll be all right?  She just didn't know what to expect.  Uh-oh.  She never heard the show.  Right.  She never knew that a father could raise a son that way.  Well, that Troy took fingers in his ass at her place.  She'll learn that today.  I'm paying him for that.  Yeah, exactly.  A Mexican trying to get me in the bushes.  That was over the edge.  That's what she thought.  What?  We can't tell about Mexican history?  It's the real deal.  That's like Pancho Villa.  So uncomfortable.  Another E-Rock song.  Enjoy your weekend.  See you Monday. 
[03:20:00]  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a man of size and weight.  Worked in radio for a long, long time.  But my skills are far from great.  Write fan fiction and I hate my job.  Cause they make fun of my shape.  Had to stay home after Sandy left. 
[03:20:30]  Cause a branch blocked my escape.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name?  Oh, yeah.  I've been known as Sex Pagos.  And I don't watch sports at all.  I bring nothing to the table.  I love garlic.  Butter sauce. 
[03:21:00]  So if you see me.  Show some sympathy.  Cause I don't count calories.  I shouted out.  Who broke the toilet seat?  When all the while.  I knew it was me.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name?  The O.P. and Anthony show is available later today with Sirius XM on demand.  Alright, you've heard about it. 
[03:21:30]  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After O.P. and Anthony live is coming up next.  Sirius XM.  And now the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is after O.N.A. live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  After O.P. and Anthony live. 
[03:22:00]  Rolando's.  Yes.  Happy Taco Day.  Happy Taco Day indeed.  How did it go?  Did you feel successful?  I didn't think so.  It was delicious.  Everybody loved it.  O.P., you know the reason Roland made today Taco Day was because he wanted to outdo Covino and Rich.  Because they had the walk-off today.  It's guac.  There's a G in that word.  Walk-off.  Guac.  Guac.  I hope he's leaving.  He doesn't want to hear it. 
[03:22:30]  Did you know that, Troy?  I did know that.  But the mariachis, that's what's going to steal the deal, bud.  But what difference does it make?  I guess every year around now they do a thing where they, like, eat guac.  The bro-off or whatever they call it.  But you decided to take it upon yourself.  You're like, well, I want to outdo them.  Yes.  But everybody else was like, who cares?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Why get so venomous and vindictive and competitive?  Because you have to here to keep your spirits up.  To keep your spirits up?  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  To keep kind of a, to stay in the light, as they say.  Correct the window.  You need to make sure you're bringing some people down.  Bring them down and then no more dicks in the ass.  So you're saying that as long as people are bringing you down, if you can bring other people down with you...  Then you fill up.  You get a little better, right.  That's what I'm saying.  So you pull people below you, so at least you're still standing on somebody.  That's what I'm saying.  I understand.  Roland loves to show his power, too.  Yeah, but he's not even really showing his...  What, so he can go to Covino and Rich and be like, hey guys, that was really cute, but did you see what I did?  Yeah, I don't even know who he tries to show it off to. 
[03:23:30]  I don't even know if Covino and Rich would even know what he did.  I don't think...  Why would they?  I think it's just maybe like his own pride and ego.  Like, oh, I am the fucking man.  But he's the only one who knows it.  Yeah, and we know it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's enough.  That's enough, right?  Yeah.  Thank you, buddy.  As long as you have it in your own mind.  Yeah.  I understand.  The tacos were good.  You should try the tacos.  He said, I don't try...  There's too much shit on them.  It was delicious because the pineapple complimented the Chipotle sauce. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, that was...  All that Chipotle sauce and the pineapple, that's not my speed.  But it's delicious.  I believe it's delicious.  They're my favorite tacos in New York City.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that because you DJ there?  No, I swear.  Tacombi fell off the wagon.  They did?  That was the other place you used to go to.  I still love Tacombi, but they switched up their recipes a little bit.  Not as good.  Different chef.  Roland said you were panicking in here.  Well, it's because, you know, I work with those guys.  Yeah.  I just think it's funny, though, how he knows how I feel.  It's just like, you go, oh, I'll go fine. 
[03:24:30]  I'll go fine.  And then it teeters.  Will it go all right or will it?  Teeters is the word you just said.  Teeter.  Like a seesaw.  That's it?  Bingo Bongo.  Yeah, but it was great, though.  And he got all his Mexican stories out.  All his what kind of stories?  Mexican.  I see.  Understood.  So you feel like Troy got a taste of what it's like for you when you have a big guest  in here and you don't know.  Just a slice.  Right.  I understand why when I see Roland after, you know, big guests is in here, like you  can just see the beads of sweat on his face. 
[03:25:00]  But if you were worried about what the people who run the place would think of this appearance,  wouldn't you think twice about announcing that you've got a finger up your ass in their  establishment?  It wasn't at their establishment.  It sounded like it was.  Well, yeah, no.  Their lounge, like you're up in a loft, like you don't even have access to the crowd.  So the girls can't come up?  No, no.  I mean, you can't, but you have to be like, hey, come on up.  You have to climb the ladder.  You have to climb up a ladder.  And then put your finger up your ass.  Well, if you want to do that, but the other place I DJ on Wednesday nights is 675 Bar 
[03:25:30]  in the Meatpacking District.  Yeah.  And there you're on the floor.  That's where the finger went up?  Yeah.  Is that the wildest thing that ever happened to you, DJing?  How long have you been DJing for?  Like over four years.  Four years?  It's been that long?  Yeah.  And is that the wildest thing that's happened?  I mean, girls come on and just start making out with me all the time.  They make out?  They kiss you on the mouth?  Yeah.  You ever check them for open sores?  I mean, you know, look.  I'd be so nervous about that.  Do you have oral herpes, but you suppress it?  Not to my knowledge.  Okay.  Because if you had it, then it's not an issue. 
[03:26:00]  Then it's just like, well, whatever.  Yeah.  And as a matter of fact, not only is it not an issue, it's a ha-ha.  You just made out with a stranger.  Guess what?  I gave you.  It's a buffet.  It's a buffet?  Yeah.  A fee-for-all.  I understand.  I understand.  But yeah, I mean, there's...  Girls just come up and make out with you?  Sometimes, yeah.  Like that rapper that got his dick sucked?  Danny Brown.  Did you hear about that?  Fuck it.  He's the man.  Roland, did you hear about this?  Yeah.  There's this rapper whose name is Danny Brown.  And there's been a couple different stories.  Danny Brown, he's just like...  He's like as famous underground as you can get, I guess. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  He's right on the cusp.  He's just blown up.  Right.  But he's weird.  Really weird.  Really weird.  Yeah.  And he was doing a show, I guess.  And the reports that I read were that he was going up to the stage and all the girls  were in the front row with their hands up and stuff, and he was putting their hands on  his dick outside his pants.  Yeah.  Like he was having them touch his dick.  And then he goes up again, and he's rapping, and some girl who's in the front row pulls 
[03:27:00]  his dick out and starts blowing him while he's on stage.  That's great.  But he's still singing?  Yeah!  While he was rapping.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  He's the man.  Danny Brown is the man, and his music is fucking, their songs are great.  All the people staring at you, and you're just rapping, and she's blowing you?  Would you think, you'd probably have to, would you get, you couldn't be bashful.  I mean, if you're, if you've got enough guts to be on stage rapping anyway, obviously  you're not a shy guy.  But, I mean, yeah, you have to be confident, like you're, it's a big one. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, but you also gotta be like, even if it's small, I'm the fucking man right now.  I'm getting blown on stage while I'm rapping.  You're all watching me rap, and I'm getting a blowjob.  Right, from that chick in the front row, who I don't even know her.  She just grabbed my dick out.  Yeah, she's just a fan of me.  There's a thing, I think Gawker, one of the websites, said that they brought up the idea  of sexual harassment.  That he was sexually assaulted.  I don't even think that he's the first rapper to do that.  I think 2 Live Crew, Luke from 2 Live Crew back in the day, was getting blowjobs on stage.  But was it like a request for a blowjob, or was it like that, where you're on stage, 
[03:28:00]  and some chick in the front row just takes your dick out of your pants?  I think it was like girls dancing, and they just start sucking his dick.  Did you hear about this, Cuban?  What's that?  There's a rapper named Danny Brown.  Fuck that guy.  And you don't like him.  Why is that?  I don't like that name.  I sound like a tough guy.  I understand.  Well, wait until you hear this.  You might change your opinion on him.  Okay, let's do it.  He's rapping, and he goes to the front of the stage, and some chick in the front row  takes his dick out of his pants.  The chick has a dick?  No.  Oh.  No, she takes Danny Brown's dick out of his pants while he's rapping, and blows  him while he's rapping on stage. 
[03:28:30]  He's alright.  He's alright.  I turned you around, didn't he?  He's an alright guy.  I'm going on iTunes later.  So if you were DJing, and you started getting blown, you'd be like, cool.  Troy.  Fuck yeah.  You would?  Yeah, of course.  Do you think it would fuck up your mojo?  Yeah, a little bit.  I mean, it's hard to pay attention.  But whatever.  You'd throw it on shuffle if you have to.  You're getting blown.  That's right.  E-Rock.  Yeah, sorry.  Fez is in here.  How's Fez doing?  He's doing alright.  Good.  He's admiring Ant's Mexican stories.  They were.  Very good. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  If you were in there, and you're running the board for O&A, and this is your ship, but  all of a sudden, some chick just walks into the room, crawls under your desk, whips  out that E-Rock cock, and starts blowing you.  Nice.  Would you kick her away?  Would you be able to maintain your composure at work?  What would happen?  Well, he doesn't focus.  True.  You don't have that much focus to lose.  It'll focus you in a minute, though.  Yeah, that's true.  I'd be startled, and then I'd want to know what's going on.  I guess it would all depend on who it was that crawled under that desk.  But I'm not going to kick her in the face and say, ew, what are you doing? 
[03:29:30]  Well, that's what they were saying on this article that said that-  Was she gross looking?  I don't know.  I saw a weird, scratchy photo of her, so you couldn't really tell.  It was blurry and stuff.  It was like a cell phone picture or something.  But, I mean, even if she was gross, it's like, I'm getting blown on stage while I'm rapping.  This is kind of awesome.  If you're a one, but you give out blowjobs like that, you're automatically a seven.  Right.  That's a lot of points to move up the scale.  I just saw Danny Brown did a free show here in New York City like two, three weeks ago.  Did you blow him? 
[03:30:00]  No, I didn't blow him.  You would have ended up on all the websites if you had.  He's a model for Uniqlo now.  Did you know that?  Oh, really?  No.  No, he's one of the, and he's great because he's like this black tooth crazy hair and  he's missing his front tooth.  And Uniqlo is this, I don't know if you have it everywhere, we have it in New York now.  It's this Japanese clothing store, but they have all their ads for models.  They put up a whole bunch of different models.  Some of them are models, some of them are actresses, some of them are just random people  they find on the street.  So I guess Danny Brown, the rapper who got blown, is now a model for Uniqlo? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Does he look like a fashion model?  I saw a picture of him.  I didn't see a fashion model.  Let's see here.  I guess he's got his own look, but.  So anyway, when I was there, you should have seen the girls that were there to see him,  that were like screaming for him.  White women?  They're mostly like, there you go, mostly like black, like ethnic girls.  There were some white girls, but the weird thing is like there's a weird thing going  on with like black chicks now, where they're black.  They've always been black. 
[03:31:00]  A lot of people don't know that.  The girls that like him are like black punk rock chicks.  Oh, I see.  Like this girl was probably as tall as me, six foot tall, gorgeous black girl, beautiful.  And she had a clothespin in her septum, like a big clothespin.  I was just like.  Definitely molested as a kid.  What's, what is.  But that's like, that's the thing now is like in the, in the ghetto, they're sort of doing  like, you know, the urban thing is like punk rock.  Because it's different.  Right.  Because it's, you know, you've been doing the same thing.  But what's the attitude like on these girls?  Is it like a white punk rock chick or are they still like, they're like punk rock chicks 
[03:31:30]  that are a little hood.  Really?  Yeah.  You like that.  I mean, I just, I love black girls.  So you do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got jungle fever.  Of course.  Does your chick, does that make her insecure?  Who am I?  Your, your girl that you're with now.  Cause she's not black.  No, she, she, she's down with black girls too.  Okay.  So you, but, but she's never like, oh, you know, would you want to trade me out for a  black chick?  Sam is blowing up her spot.  No, no, no, no, no.  You're fishing for something.  No, my, my, no, no, no.  Cause I want, cause I want, cause, cause I used to date black women.  Everybody knows this.  And so my wife now who's white, that makes, that makes her insecure. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  No, my chick is weird.  She's just like, she's like the most bad-ass chick ever.  Yeah.  Like she's just, if I point out a hot girl, she's like, oh yeah, bitch is hot.  She's like, you want to fuck that girl?  I want to fuck that girl.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you feel about that?  And you're like, whoa.  Yeah.  I don't know how to, I don't know how to process this right now.  I lost my virginity to a black girl.  You did?  Yeah.  Did she steal it?  She was hot, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How old were you?  Uh, 14.  14.  Why are you shaking your head in disgust, Alan?  I'm not shaking my head in disgust. 
[03:32:30]  Iraq, was he shaking his, as soon as you said you lost your virginity to a black girl,  Alan just started shaking his head.  That's why I voted for him.  Cause he's a fucking asshole, right?  He just fucked up shit like that.  How come you were shaking your head when the Cuban was, uh, you can talk into Anthony's  microphone.  I'm sure he won't mind.  How come you were shaking your head when the Cuban said that he lost his virginity?  I was nodding my head.  You were nodding?  Yeah.  Was he nodding or shaking, Iraq?  From here, it looked like he was shaking his head.  I mean, you know, normally a nod doesn't look like a shake.  Iraq's not a liar.  Iraq doesn't lie.  That's one thing he doesn't do.  Well, my body was like kind of cocked over. 
[03:33:00]  So maybe, like, he, like.  Did you just call me something?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you just call me something racist?  I think he called you a cocksucker.  No, no, my body was cocked over.  Ew.  What?  It's fucking tough being a minority in here.  So, why were you nodding your head then?  Oh, just, you know, that's, that's cool.  Like.  Fuck it, A.  Yeah.  Fuck it, black chick.  Yeah.  I mean, I lost my virginity to a black chick.  It's, it's all good, man.  Yeah, she's hot.  Yeah.  She looks like Lisa Bonet.  She's like light-skinned.  Beautiful.  Are you still banging that black chick?  Yeah, every now and then.  Good for you, Alan.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  How do you think Asshole of the Week went today?  Uh, I thought it went fairly well.  I mean, you know.  Did you realize that you got almost all the votes for you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little disheartening.  Yeah.  That's the second week in a row that happened.  Yeah, but, you know, maybe next week.  No.  Yeah, I mean, next week, I would say this.  Next week, I would assume that you won't get all the votes.  I mean, it can't be three weeks in a row.  No, I was going to think because it probably won't happen next week.  Oh, okay.  Probably, they probably won't want to do it again next week.  I think I saw the last one.  Yeah, you think that was it, Cuban, don't you know?  I saw the Titanic. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  This one was bad.  You didn't enjoy it?  Nah.  What do you think went wrong with the Asshole of the Week today?  It's just it's over.  It's a one and done.  It's a one and done thing.  The new and exciting part of it was last week.  Because Asshole of the Week, the title would make you think, oh, we're going to do this  every week and find out what, maybe this week the Asshole was Alan, but next week the Asshole,  it'd probably be Alan again.  But at least there's a new vote every week.  And if it's Alan next week, it's like, oh, yeah, okay.  Right, we saw this one coming.  He's a fucking asshole.  That could be Alan's new nickname.  That way you can keep it going. 
[03:34:30]  Asshole of the Week.  Right, hey, Asshole of the Week, the intern.  You don't mind being Asshole of the Week two weeks in a row?  You know, you got to kind of keep your head up on these kinds of things.  Yeah, like Tupac says.  Yeah.  You got to keep your head up.  A win's a win.  Right.  Now, what about Sal?  He's voted.  Everybody's putting in their votes.  And Sal actually goes to the trouble of affixing a photo of you sleeping at work to his vote.  True hater.  I don't know. 
[03:35:00]  I mean, Sal's been pretty standoffish to me this entire day.  Why is that?  I mean, I don't know.  Like, you know, I was trying to tell him earlier about, like, you know, Crunk Bear, which he didn't know anything about.  Tell me about Crunk Bear.  I was this Colorado teacher that got fired because she...  You know about Crunk Bear, Troy?  No.  Tell me about him.  Did they suck his dick on stage still?  No, it was actually...  It was a chick.  It was this really hot, like, 25-year-old Colorado teacher.  And she posted up a bunch of pictures of her twerking and smoking pot on Twitter.  Mm-hmm.  I see.  And, yeah.  How come you didn't let Alan talk to you about Crunk Bear? 
[03:35:30]  Hang on.  I'm trying to answer the fucking phone.  No, you weren't.  You told me that...  All Alan does...  I'm trying to watch people fucking twerk.  All Alan does is, if we're in there, he just chimes in every two fucking seconds.  And I'm trying to, like, look up articles or whatever the hell I'm doing, if I'm looking  at Reddit or whatever.  Yeah.  And he's...  Alan's just like, oh, blah, blah, blah.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  No one cares.  I had great instincts when I liked the way I did.  Yeah.  Do you not chime in every two minutes?  You just, hey, Eric, look up... 
[03:36:00]  Like, no one cares.  Let the guys do their show that they want to do.  Do you think that's a fair assessment?  Or do you think you were trying to bring Crunk Bear to the table?  Well, because what if ONA wanted to talk about Crunk Bear?  I just thought Crunk Bear was, like, a really funny story.  I mean...  Yeah.  I mean, there was, like, once all that happened, like, all the boys in the high school, like,  got together and formed, like, a coalition to keep the teacher in the school.  The coalition for Crunk Bear?  Yeah.  No, it was a huge thing.  Like, big DJs were creating, like, a hashtag for a name.  So how come Sal turns around and says, who gives a fuck? 
[03:36:30]  I didn't say that.  I just ignored it.  You just said it just now.  Well, I don't give a fuck now.  No, no.  I said I understood.  You said nobody gives a fuck, which is fair.  I'm just asking.  I didn't say that earlier.  I know he gives a fuck now about whatever bear.  But now you're saying that he kind of talks to you about these things that nobody gives  a fuck about.  Yeah.  Right.  He chimes in about shit left and right when I'm just zoned out.  I'm doing my own thing.  When he's like, check out this, blah, blah, blah.  It's like...  What kind of shit is he chiming in about?  I don't know.  It's that fucking...  Mundane?  Mundane that I just tuned it out. 
[03:37:00]  Do you do that a lot?  Well, I mean, I don't know.  I don't think I chime in with mundane bullshit, but, you know...  People are talking.  Well, Sal's talking.  I mean...  Why would Sal be saying this if it wasn't true?  I mean, I voted for Sal for Asshole of the Week.  They didn't give you a fucking taco?  That was the reason.  That was the reason, Alan?  That reason's kind of why.  I mean, that...  Who all week has been trying to help you get on better terms with Troy and the people  that you've been fucking up with?  Me, I guess.  But what does that have to do with Sal?  I mean, no, Sal, you have been helping me out, but for some reason today, you've been 
[03:37:30]  in a pissy mood, and it's...  Because I don't care what you have to say.  Wow.  You don't even want to hear it.  No.  Just not having it.  At this point, you don't even want to hear what he has to say.  Like, in case it might be interesting this time, you're out of that zone.  It's been too much bullshit.  Choose that channel.  Yeah.  Click.  He's on MTV 2.  Okay?  You're VH1.  All right.  That's two below.  Dos, it's Cinco de Mayo.  Yeah.  In your face.  What do you think? 
[03:38:00]  I mean, Sal, why would he be saying this if it wasn't the case?  Because he's a narcissistic prick at times.  Oh.  He is.  Yeah, he is.  Sal told me in the bathroom that you can't fight.  I don't think that's true.  I think the Cuban's just egging you on a little bit.  It was somebody.  Somebody said it.  I believe that.  I was pissing.  I didn't look.  Right.  Good for you.  Are you a narcissistic prick?  Yeah.  Do you think that's a good way to be?  No, but I know I am.  And it's a fault that I've realized.  Why don't you try to work on it?  I do. 
[03:38:30]  Not very hard.  I mean, Alan.  Saying you're a narcissistic prick and then not doing anything about it does not do anything  about working on it.  I just told you I'm working on it, Alan.  What are you doing to work on it?  Being a narcissistic prick or hoping it peters off as you get older?  Why do I need an intern telling me what fucking personality disorders I have and what  I need to work on?  He's right, though.  I mean, I don't think, you know, just saying I'm a narcissistic prick and then acting like one  and hoping that it just peters out at some point.  That's not working on it.  No, I told you I'm working on it.  I try to do things differently.  What are we doing to work on it?  Well, I just try to be less selfish.  They don't look at each other when they fight. 
[03:39:00]  You know, this definitely will never escalate.  This is so, like, I don't give a fuck about Alan.  Like, I try to be nice to him and I always tell him, like, dude, if you need help with  something, come to me.  If someone's giving you something you need help with, and he's just ridiculous.  What do you mean he's ridiculous?  He's just ridiculous.  He wants to call me a prick and he wants to annoy me when I'm working.  Narcissistic prick.  Yeah, narcissistic prick.  At least he's working on it.  But you admitted to that.  You said he was right.  Yeah.  I mean, I just don't know.  Do you think Sal's working on it?  No. 
[03:39:30]  Is Sal less of a narcissistic prick today than he was the day you met him?  No.  More?  Why do I need to fucking justify what I'm working on with him?  Oh, that's shit.  True.  That's between him and the Lord.  Yeah.  I mean, between you and Eric, I mean, you guys are my mentors.  I am nothing to you.  I am not your boss.  I'm not anything.  I go out of my way to say, hey, Alan, if you want to talk about something, you need  help with something.  Punk ass.  Although everybody here is kind of your mentor, aren't they?  That is true.  That is true.  I mean, out of anybody who works here, Sal is probably the person that has the most face 
[03:40:00]  time with me.  And who do you think is the biggest prick to you?  Sal.  Sal.  Yeah.  He is.  Yeah.  Whew.  Sal.  You're the biggest...  Well, I mean, I'm the one who's going to relay a lot of shit to him.  Like, hey, go do this or go do that.  You know?  So, like, of course, if the person is telling you to do work all the time, you can harbor  resentment towards that.  And who else can Sal really treat like an asshole?  Is that...  Does he do that?  That's a good point, Troy.  Do you think Sal does it?  Does Sal kind of take all the shit that Sal gets, and justifiably so, all the shit that 
[03:40:30]  Sal gets, does he take that and put it onto you?  I mean, maybe.  You think so?  I don't think he...  Like, here's the thing.  I don't think he actively thinks about, you know, behaving this way or doing these things.  I think it's just so part of his base nature and his core principles as a human being.  Just having a very, you know, twitchy, angry attitude.  Methy.  Yeah.  Like, so just something like, you know, like, why the fuck are you talking to me?  Like, what are you...  Like, what...  I'm nothing to Sal.  I know this. 
[03:41:00]  But that's just his personality.  Yeah.  Is that like a rich kid thing?  It might be, but it's just one of these things where it's like, I can't get Sal anywhere in  his life.  Like, I have no benefit to him, so why should he deal well?  Right, and I'm the one who's being nice to you and coming to you and helping you out  about certain things.  And you want to start fucking talking shit.  I mean, that's not a good attitude to have to anybody, though.  What do you mean?  To walk in and say, well, they have nothing for me.  They add nothing to my life.  I didn't say that.  He analyzed that and he put that on me.  I never said that. 
[03:41:30]  I said, I'm the one who goes to him and I help him out in times of need as what interns  are here for.  You know, they're here to learn.  Iraq, you share an office with these two.  What's going on here?  I've seen both sides of this.  And to go with Sal here, I have seen him put in a lot of effort to help Alan learn things  despite the fact that we've taught him and talked to him over and over and he's still  making the same mistakes.  Sal even buys this guy lunch.  Wow.  Did Sal buy lunch for you?  Sal has bought lunch for me before.  Yeah.  That's not something a narcissistic prick would do.  That was last Friday and I, and what was it, two days ago I bought you lunch because 
[03:42:00]  she does help me out with some of my work.  Did you just say she does?  I heard it.  Maybe.  I think so.  That's a bit disrespectful.  I didn't do it on purpose.  But I buy Alan Thicke breakfast all the time.  You do?  Yeah.  I've never bought him a thing.  Not one.  I've never given him a penny.  The interns do help us out.  So it's a nice little, like, you know, a little, it's like, hey, they don't get much.  So it's like, yeah.  Would you buy him for breakfast?  What do you, I don't even know what you order.  I just get money.  I say, order whatever you want.  Really?  I gave him books and video games.  Yeah, no.  Roland, Roland really hooks it up. 
[03:42:30]  I teach you about life.  I don't, like, you know, disregard the fact that you guys do this.  I was actually going to bring up the fact that you let me buy some Shake Shack the other  day.  It was great.  I really appreciate it.  I had a, yeah, a shake burger and a, just, I think it was a peanut butter milkshake.  Now, what about when Troy says, here's, just take some money.  Breakfast time.  What do you get for yourself?  I mean, depends on what I'm getting.  I usually try not to spend more than what he's spending, because it just feels weird to 
[03:43:00]  me.  Yeah, but you get a little something for lunch, too?  A little extra?  Nah.  Like, I'm not going to eat it all for breakfast, but Troy said to get whatever.  Yeah, a little snack for mid-morning, something like that.  There's some expensive gum they got there.  Yeah.  I mean, I have to give Troy his receipt, so I don't want him to look it down and go, like,  well, I'm never going to help this guy out again.  No, I wouldn't do that.  It sounds like everybody's kind of helping you out a little bit.  I don't know.  Look, I mean, like, I'm.  They bought you things.  Right.  You know?  Maybe it's like an incentive, so he's like.  Absolutely.  But if that were an incentive, it doesn't work.  That's what you're, that's what you wanted, Sal. 
[03:43:30]  You're like, okay, kind of act like a prick to him sometimes, because I get frustrated.  No, I don't buy him lunch pertaining to the fact that, like, I'm a prick to him.  I don't, I would never do that.  Right.  It's like, you help me out with something I needed, or you consistently help me out with  something I need.  Here's a little reward.  And maybe it's like, okay, well, if I do good work.  So you shoot him like a pet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, like, like you're the intern whisperer.  Yeah, maybe.  That's a good way looking at it.  Eric, you ever buy, uh, you ever buy anything for intern Alan?  For Alan, no.  And he's the one with all the money, too. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  That's some bullshit, huh?  Yeah.  I bought Eric a couple of things before, too.  What'd you buy for Eric?  Uh, for his birthday, I got him a, uh, Legend of Zelda history book.  Jesus Christ.  He bought you a birthday present, Eric?  He did.  The way you guys shit on this kid, and he's sitting there buying you birthday presents?  What are you doing accepting birthday presents from the intern?  I didn't know what to do.  I didn't expect anything from anybody.  He just hands it to me.  What else did you buy him?  Uh, when Eric was feeling really tired one day, so I got him a Red Bull.  Uh, with your own money? 
[03:44:30]  I gave him a massage, too.  Eric offered to pay for it.  Eric gave him money to buy.  Eric, tell me a massage.  Because I said, I'm really feeling bad today.  Could you go buy me a Red Bull?  Yeah, and I got you a second one.  No, but I got you a second one with my own money, because I, I, you, you really seemed  frazzled today.  I wanted to make sure that you're, you're, you're going to feel better.  I don't understand why you guys shit on him like this.  He wants to make sure you feel better.  He buys you video game books for your birthday.  Sal said he hated him in the bathroom.  You said you hated him?  I never said that.  First of all, stop talking to strangers in the bathroom, Sal.  You don't know the human. 
[03:45:00]  I was in two stalls, too.  Let's, let's go to 516.  Hey, how's it going?  I got two things for you.  Yeah.  One, if he wins Asshole of the Week again, we're going to have an Asshole Dynasty on our  hands.  True.  That's the first one.  And the second one is Slabo!  Eric, I'm in here, dude.  That was not you that time.  That was just somebody who wanted to.  But that's okay.  Yeah.  They want to yell Slabo.  They can yell Slabo.  Is that what you're hoping for, maybe?  To just, to three-peat?  Trifecta. 
[03:45:30]  Is next week your last week as an intern?  Uh, I think two weeks from now.  No, next week.  Next week?  Oh, wow.  Shats, that's some bad news, huh?  Yeah.  Counting on two weeks.  Are you, are you looking forward to that day, Eric?  Um, be honest.  No, because then we have two weeks without interns.  Yeah, but I mean, what's going to, is it going to make a huge difference?  Uh, it will during the live show.  Why?  A lot of runs have to be done.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I'll be right.  I can still come in if you, well.  You can't.  No, you can't. 
[03:46:00]  No.  No, all right.  That's illegal.  You did, too, here already.  Are you going to miss this internship, Alan?  Uh, yeah.  I actually am.  All right.  What are you going to fight harder for next week?  Trying to make sure that your internship meant something, or making sure you get that third  asshole of the week title before you leave?  I mean, I'm just one and the same.  It is, isn't it?  Look.  Yeah.  Fighting hard to make sure it counts will get him that asshole of the week title.  I don't.  Just keep fucking it up.  I don't think I did a bad job this week.  I don't, like.  I mean.  Troy, you disagree a little bit.  Yeah, no, he didn't do a good job.  Okay.  We were talking about that yesterday, actually. 
[03:46:30]  That you didn't do a great job this week, so.  Yeah, this was a bad week.  That's what they're saying in the hole.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, to be fair, yesterday I asked you for a clip from a show.  Very easy to get.  That's not good.  I mean, it literally took 90 minutes.  I even had to, I had to even give him the fucking show.  I mean, all you had to do was ask Erick for the clip.  Yeah, but he disappeared, like, right when you asked me that.  He would have just burned it for you.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  I'm still waiting on all the clips.  This is three weeks we're going on.  Are we still on this phone call thing? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Have you given up yet?  Have you tried talk radio?  Did you look at talk radio, Alan?  Have you seen that movie?  No, I haven't.  You haven't caught that one yet, huh?  No.  It's online for free.  You'll get to it.  Or even the Sheila movie where he has a DJ.  Yeah.  All of it.  Good morning, Vietnam.  I don't care.  I don't give a fuck what movie it is with radio.  I mean, we were literally just talking yesterday about watching talk radio and how, like,  if it were me, I'd just go home and watch the whole thing tonight or whatever.  Yeah.  But you had stuff going on? 
[03:47:30]  Um, yeah.  Like, it's completely, like, he is completely signed off on the idea of him even attempting  to do this for me.  Right.  Like, it's done.  It's like, it's not going to happen.  Because he's like, well, I got yelled at for it, so at least I don't, at least it's done.  Yeah.  I'm not signed off on it.  I mean, I just had a very busy day.  Yeah, Sam.  Oh, hi, dude.  Sam, I just fired interns or no?  I mean, you really have to fuck up.  I mean, really?  We have fired.  He's pretty bad.  Seven right now.  Yeah.  What's the number if 10 is firing?  I mean, 10 is like, Sal said nine. 
[03:48:00]  Let's go.  I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask Sal and then Troy, and then since  E-Rock's the intern boss, I'm going to ask E-Rock, Sal, what's the number?  10 is firing.  One is, he's getting hired.  Right now.  Right now, I'd say like, eight.  Eight is high.  Eight is high.  Troy, where are you at?  Eight or nine.  Or even the nine.  And I'll tell you why, because I have seen interns get fired for sleeping on the job. 
[03:48:30]  He has slept on the job multiple times.  He showed up.  It's a show that we have to be here on time.  He has to be on the show.  I didn't judge him for that.  You don't agree on that.  It's all right.  And he shows up two hours late sometimes.  Sometimes he's calling in.  We don't know where he's at.  And he can't get the job done of what we need him to do.  E-Rock, what do you think?  Yeah, I agree with Troy.  Eight or nine.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  There's been discussions higher than me about letting him go.  What?  Wow.  How high?  About as high as you can go as far as the president of the department goes. 
[03:49:00]  Jesus?  Alan?  Jesus?  Was it with Jesus, Eric?  No, it was not with Jesus.  Baby Jesus?  Jesus?  I would have given you a three.  That's me, though.  I guess I don't make those decisions.  You are out of touch with this situation.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  I'm up here, Cuban.  I'm up on my pedestal.  I hear you.  And all this stuff is going around below me.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  But, Captain, there's shit going on in the infantry right now.  I know.  I've got to make sure that shit is together.  Let me go to 540. 
[03:49:30]  You're on the air.  What's up, buddy?  Am I on the air?  Yes.  Oh, man, sorry.  I didn't hear anybody's scream.  I was wondering, the asshole of the week thing, why couldn't it have been dick of the  week so that way you could have said putting your dick in the box?  I guess we're just not that clever.  We're just looking for something that we're just not quite there.  Did you ever think about doing that, dick in the box?  No.  All right.  I'm glad you didn't.  Yeah.  318.  Great.  You're on the air.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  Enough about this cunt.  Talk about something else. 
[03:50:00]  Okay.  All right.  That's fair.  That's fair.  Thank you.  All right, Alan.  You heard the people.  You had a great day.  The people have spoken.  You're not fired, but that's it for you on the after show.  That's it for you today.  I hope you had fun.  I had fun with you, but yeah, hit the bricks if you don't mind.  That's right.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to chatter in the bathroom about this situation.  We'll just take a walk.  Cuban will monitor what's going on in the bathroom as far as you go. 
[03:50:30]  But yeah, you're still sitting there looking at me.  You go ahead and...  You're in the bathroom and you hear salsa music.  I'm in there.  Yeah.  I'm not going to walk with you.  So you go ahead and get to stepping, as they say.  Don't break your ass on the way out.  Right.  I knew this was bad.  And you're going to go ahead and take Jim's half-eaten breakfast?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  You go ahead and do that.  You enjoy that for yourself.  Should he go in the bathroom and eat it?  I'll find out about it.  Does he want the coffee?  Take the coffee.  Have a sip.  Enjoy it. 
[03:51:00]  Alan Thicke, Jr.  That's it for you, though.  You're slowly, slowly making your way out of here.  Man, I'm a sucker for quarters, dude.  Yeah, no.  He's hoping...  I'm a sucker for corduroy, too.  He looks great.  He looks great today.  Alan...  He looks very professional today.  You look great today.  He's wearing a blazer, but is there anything you want to yell before you leave?  Don't come to a mic, but you can yell.  I'll hear it.  He's just shaking his head no.  He already gave me a 9 out of 10.  I'm not going to do that.  All right.  I gave you a 3, though.  I know.  But I don't make these decisions.  There's always next internship. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  Well, not for him.  This is it for him.  Well, I'll go to somewhere else.  Well, that was Alan Thicke, Jr., everybody.  I hope you enjoyed him.  Have fun at QVC, Alan.  Let's go to 918.  You there?  No, I'm not going to talk to you.  Let's go to the next 918.  You.  Yeah.  Allow me.  Me?  Yes.  You.  Yep.  Okay.  There you go.  That's a nice little palate cleanser for all of us.  Speaking of palate cleansers and things that are nice, things that make us feel good, 
[03:52:00]  here's a question.  The most important holiday.  Do any of you know?  Mother's Day.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  Cuban was about to say Navidad.  Christmas.  That's not true.  It's close.  It's close.  Valentine's Day is close, too.  But Troy is right.  It's Mother's Day, indeed.  What are you getting for your mom?  Do you love her?  Well, you better make sure that she knows it.  Make sure all the moms in your life know it.  Cuban, that's a lot of moms for you.  17.  Yeah.  So what is the perfect gift?  You've got to get all of them the perfect gift. 
[03:52:30]  Well, it's Steven Singer's famous gold-dipped roses, of course.  I got trouble for this last time.  I'm not saying anything.  Yeah, maybe you shouldn't.  It's the perfect gift for your mom, your mother-in-law, or the mother of your children.  A real long-stem rose dipped in 24-karat pure gold.  This is a gift that lasts forever, and it's only $69.  Yes.  For a dozen or one?  Only $69.  For one.  It's pure gold.  Oh, shit.  I mean, you're taking a real rose, right?  Follow me on this.  It's a real rose.  It's a long-stem rose.  And he dips.  It's dipped.  I don't know how he does it. 
[03:53:00]  It's futuristic, to say the least.  But it's dipped in pure gold.  And what you're left with is a gold flower that lasts forever.  It's only $69.  That's it.  So it's like what they did to Han Solo.  That's exactly right, but with gold instead of carbonite.  Gotcha.  That's exactly right.  Steven Singer's real long-stem rose.  They come shipped in a beautiful gift box with your own personalized Mother's Day card.  It's wonderful.  And he's got special colors available only for Mother's Day.  They sell out early every year.  You don't want to miss out on the new color for 2013. 
[03:53:30]  It's gold, though.  What do you mean new color?  Well, they color the flower itself.  Holy shit, I'm confused.  It's beautiful.  You've got to see it.  It's on his website.  Timeless Turquoise.  How much are these in Puerto Rico?  If they make them $10, everyone will have them.  I don't know if it's $10.  It's $69 in the continental United States.  Check it out online right now.  At IHateStevenSinger.com.  Order now or miss out on this beautiful new color, Timeless Turquoise.  You can get free shipping anywhere in the U.S.

Or go to IHateStevenSinger.com and order your Mother's Day rose.  You going to order one of those, Roland?  I'm going to ask him for one.  Good.  I've got one.  You are?  Good.  732.  732.  732.  You're on the after show.  978.  Hey, this is Eric from New Jersey. 
[03:54:30]  Hello!  I've got to go to 914.  914.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Where are you from?  I'm from New Rochelle.  That's what's up.  New Roch!  New Rock City!  Hey!  Hey, my boy Joey S. from New Rochelle, who I think you know, you guys do the WWE together.  He says that your uncle is Jake the Snake Roberts.  Yeah, that's true.  Yep.  Yes, it is.  We used to trade snakes.  Yeah, it's true.  It's amazing. 
[03:55:00]  It's amazing.  He used to show me a snake when I was a little kid.  No, I'm not serious.  It's not even his real fucking name.  Jake is a wrestler.  I thought that shit was real.  No, that shit is not real, dude.  You told me Ricky the Dragon Seambo wasn't real.  His middle name's not even really the dragon.  British Bulldogs?  Where were they from?  They're Canadians.  Both of them.  Bullshit real.  Yeah, no, both of them.  They were from Jamaica.  I don't fucking know what you're talking about.  Both of them.  That's why British Bulldogs started having those braids.  He was Jamaican.  Everybody knows that.  By the way...  Jimmy the Heart?  Jimmy the Heart wasn't even a wrestler.  He just made that up. 
[03:55:30]  There was a guy named Jimmy Hart, but not the heart.  In Mexico, there was Jimmy.  Oh.  Jimmy La Corazon.  Don't tell me what I didn't see when I was little.  Anyway.  Anyway.  You know what is real?  Did you see, Roland, that I put the video of my cat falling  off a printer on YouTube?  I told you, yeah.  Troy, could you pull that up for Roland?  I want you to see this, because I showed it to you on my phone,  and Roland's the one that told me...  Because I made this Vine video.  My cat jumped up on a printer, and then he fell right on his fat ass.  He fell off.  You hear your wife in the background going, 
[03:56:00]  Oh!  Yeah.  And I tried to put it through on Vine, and it didn't work.  So now I just uploaded it onto YouTube.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  That's it.  That's it.  It's a cat falling off a printer.  It seems like it should be gold, right?  I think you've got some hits on there.  You think so?  Yeah.  It's on Twitter slash NotSam, if you want to see it.  Terry in Delaware.  Hey, what am I doing?  I hope that was Slavo, but just make your Slavo's clear and concise. 
[03:56:30]  Eric, did you know...  First of all, you see that cat fall off that printer?  Yes.  Crazy shit, huh?  Right.  Right.  Now, did you know this guy had a SoundCloud page, and he was just posting songs about you?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah.  How come you didn't share it with any of us?  Because you played his shit during the jingle contest.  Not all those new songs.  Okay.  Well, why would I bring that up?  All right.  That is an argument I can understand.  I don't know if you guys heard this, but there's some guy who just sits at home making 
[03:57:00]  E-Rock parody songs.  What's his name?  I don't know.  Fat Fuck.  You know what his name is.  Should we book him for the after show?  We should book him for the main show.  I think at this point, he's moved on to that level.  I wonder if he can perform him live.  I would like to.  I would like to find out.  I love Eric, but that song, Snacks, was fucking awesome.  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks.  I want to go to a club out, do like sneaky bumps.  Yeah.  Just eating like flavored goldfish and stuff.  Eric, which was your favorite of the Eric songs?  None of them.  Which if you had to pick one? 
[03:57:30]  I don't.  But if you had to?  I won't.  What if it's Nazi rape your family or you got to pick a song?  Shit.  Fucking pick a song.  Oh, no.  He's going to let his family get raped?  Even I would pick a song.  Yeah.  And Frank them.  I don't know if Nazis raped and for that.  It's horrible, Roland.  Yeah.  You know how hard it is to find Nazis on top of that angry one?  Why would you say that?  I'm looking at this phone screen.  It's terrible.  One guy says, I want to tell you.  All right.  I'm going to Eric. 
[03:58:00]  I'm not going to take it.  Why are you encouraging this?  This will be the one call I'm not going to take any more after it.  It's ridiculous what happens to these phones.  You say one little thing and they go crazy.  You see what your Mike Tyson thing?  No, but I'm not going to give it away for the best slot.  Eric, what did you want to say?  Well, Sam, first of all, you're the best broadcaster of all time.  Thank you very much.  And I want Eric to jiggle his tits for me.  Eric, would you do that for the listener?  No.  Why not?  Fuck him.  Oh, come on, Eric.  It's all about getting the loyalty from the listeners and pleasing the customer. 
[03:58:30]  No, it ain't.  We're in a consumer world.  Yet, these are your customers.  These are the people that are paying for the subscriptions.  Preach.  You got to give them what they want.  Yeah, you got to make the fans happy.  I mean, if somebody, Roland just jiggled his little tit.  And that's very nice of you to do, Roland.  That's very, very kind of you to do.  All right, you're up.  Eric won't do it.  Nope.  That's a crying shame.  I was super happy today on Opie and Anthony.  And I don't know if you heard this, Cuban. 
[03:59:00]  I did.  Twerking finally came up.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  You don't know what twerking is?  I'm a full-grown adult with a job and kids.  Well, your kids, I bet, know what twerk is.  How old are your kids?  They're seven.  Do you have any girls?  Yeah.  You better watch out.  And I'm telling you.  What is it?  This is what the kids are doing.  Troy, you want to show them what twerking is?  Because then the twerking is starting younger and younger.  You watch out for this.  If they tell you that they're going to dance or something.  Welcome, everyone.  That was like a how to twerk video.  Well, let's get to the end where she's twerking. 
[03:59:30]  Because you've got to be aware of what's going on.  Look at this.  That's twerking?  It's moving that ass.  Twerking is basically shaking.  Shaking that ass.  I'm with it 100%.  It's like it's a private lesson.  Look up twerking at Walmart, Troy.  That's the one we were looking at.  No, but that's not fair.  Anything at Walmart sucks.  No, no, no.  Look at this chick.  This chick is a talent.  Her name is Caramel Kitten?  It may not work full screen.  It wasn't earlier today.  Just hit escape.  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  Check this chick out.  Look up twerking at Walmart if you get a chance.  It says 18 plus, but there's no actual age restriction on it.  She's just...  Oh, yeah.  God, I love that.  It's like a washing machine.  I just want to put my face right there.  What's so great about this video is that they just did it on a cell phone.  They didn't even add any music to it or anything.  It's so raw.  It's just a girl.  Just a hood rat.  And it's by the bakery department.  Just a ratchet ass hoe.  Twerking in the middle of a Walmart. 
[04:00:30]  Look at her by the milk.  Oh, get your eagle on, girl.  What time of day do you think this happened at?  Noon.  Noon, right?  Probably.  Like, they're kids shopping.  Wow.  God.  Listen, listen, listen.  Listen.  Damn.  Does that excite you, Cuban?  Is someone kicking a wall next to her or is that her ass?  That's her ass.  Shut up.  Ant wanted no part of this, believe it or not.  Wow.  I mean, come on.  Really?  Wow, that's weird. 
[04:01:00]  Anthony today likened it to putting pit bulls in a trunk and having them fight in the trunk  of a car.  I said, I think there's a...  I think before you get to trunking, twerking is okay.  Yeah, and everybody meet from Walmart again.  Why?  Because there are women twerking in front of him?  God.  I would.  It's like hypnotizing to me.  I would always go grocery shopping at Walmart if I knew this was going on.  You can get that girl if you just roll up in a brand new Hyundai Elantra.  Is that all she needs?  Yeah.  All she needs is an Elantra. 
[04:01:30]  A couple scratch-offs and some crunches.  I think she's great.  I'm a fan.  Does she do parties?  Kids parties?  Oh, shit.  We got a celebrity on the phone.  Sean F.  Gentlemen.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  This, Sean F., is the guy who wrote all those amazing E-Rock songs.  Right, right.  Snacks is great.  So you've just been uploading, and we didn't even, I mean, I didn't know about that you  had a whole SoundCloud full of these songs.  Well, I'll tell you, the contest really kind of just turned it on, man. 
[04:02:00]  It's back in November when the, you know, the contest.  By the way, I'm a lot more funny on the internet than I am in person.  I mean, look, you don't have to be funny conversationally as long as you can pump out E-Rock songs.  What is it about Eric Nagel that he acts as your muse?  How does he become your creative stimulus?  Well, I've listened to the show for years, and E-Rock presents a lot of fodder for songs.  I mean, you guys are just fantastic in general, but E-Rock just puts it over the edge. 
[04:02:30]  And I think it might be a little bit of jealousy.  I mean, I would love to have a job like E-Rock where he can come into work.  And get called a fat fuck all day?  Right. Now, don't get me wrong.  E-Rock just tweeted me back and said, then why?  I don't want to say that E-Rock is a horrible person.  He's not. He's a funny guy.  Right.  But maybe there's jealousy there, because, you know, and I see that a lot, especially with you guys.  You guys got the interns in there that don't do any work.  Mm-hmm.  People on higher levels that don't do any work. 
[04:03:00]  That's right.  And you're just like, come on, man. Just do it, man.  You're in a great position.  Everybody would love to be where you are right now.  So you're thinking it's jealousy because you don't think E-Rock does shit.  And you know what? That's only what I hear.  Maybe E-Rock does a lot of stuff behind the scenes, you know?  Right. But your impression is that he does not.  But what made it so that he was the guy for you?  Because there's so many, you know, characters and there's so much stuff going on.  You have literally written half a dozen songs about E-Rock.  Right, right, right. 
[04:03:30]  Well, again, there's a lot of stuff, man.  You can talk about all the food he eats, the snacks he likes.  The titties?  The titties.  Toys?  Yeah, the titties with the gut.  I'm trying to come up with a song about that Pitfall shirt.  I love that there's a picture online with him with that Pitfall shirt.  Yeah.  The seductive eyes?  Yeah, there's so many cool things to come up with with E-Rock, man.  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure out the next step.  I mean, you're talking about Pitfall.  How about Pitstains, huh?  Right, right.  You know?  There's more.  There's more.  Every day there's more.  I'll come into work, you know, with a guy about an hour drive. 
[04:04:00]  What do you do for a living?  Make awesome songs.  Yeah, can't make money doing that.  But no, I'm in sales, which sucks.  But back in the day, you know, I used to do radio, TV, and film in college.  Well, you could do, like, I would think about, seriously, you know, Drew Boogie has sold  some of his stuff on iTunes and stuff like that.  What if you made an album of Eric Nagel-inspired songs, and this is something you could make  a little money for yourself, maybe?  Or do the Nagel mixtape.  I don't know about all the copyright implications and all that, Jess. 
[04:04:30]  Okay, then yeah, then Troy's right, just put it out in the streets, and just put out  the Sex Bagel mixtape.  Right.  And you know what?  One thing, if I can take one thing away from this phone call.  Yeah.  E-Rock, unblock me from your Twitter.  Why would you block him, E-Rock?  He loves you.  Why would I be friends with him?  You're his muse!  He blocked me after, like, the third song.  I'm like, come on, man.  That's not cool.  You know, I'd be great.  I'd have a great idea.  What's that?  You know how Fridays are turning into, like, a fun day where we have food, and we just hang  out in the studio, I think while we're eating food that Roland provides, I think that we 
[04:05:00]  should listen to a brand new E-Rock song from this gentleman every single week.  It will premiere.  Yeah, it will premiere while we're eating.  I'll cater the shit out of that.  Sean F., we'd be happy to do Friday premieres for you whenever you have songs ready.  Oh, please.  We'll use the ones that are on there now.  I'll try to come up with more, but I just...  I'll twerk to it.  Yeah, the Cuban will twerk.  If you could do something that we could twerk to, it'd be huge.  My favorite so far is definitely Snacks.  I mean, Snacks is number one.  Yeah.  Grammy.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, I just posted the Fat E-Rock today, which is kind of a short one.  Tributes to Run-DMC.  I did a Run-DMC earlier.  You guys might remember around Christmas time.  I did the Christmas song with O&A.  Right.  Where can they find your SoundCloud page?  SoundCloud is a weird kind of email.  Let me see.  What is it?  SoundCloud slash Sean F.  Or some crap.  What's your Twitter?  People will find it that way.  Twitter's better.  It's Mondo270 on Twitter.  And then you have the link right there to my SoundCloud.  All right, buddy.  All you guys, especially E-Rock.  E-Rock, love you, man.  Keep it up.  I'll talk to you later. 
[04:06:00]  When I was in the bathroom, I heard Eric say that he hates this fucking guy.  It sucks, man.  You stay in that bathroom, though.  Listen.  I'm scared.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Stay tuned for that Sunday.  My show's on at 4 p.m. Eastern, so listen to that.  But, yeah, we'll see you next week.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next. 
[04:06:30]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
