<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, insulting themselves with various derogatory terms and joking about their numerous arrests.  They played a clip from a previous show showing a large man being tased twice.  A caller, Andy from England, discussed "Whip-I'm-Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging listeners to expose their genitalia, and complained about XM Satellite Radio's US billing address requirement.  The hosts bantered with him about cultural differences and time zones.  The conversation shifted to the perceived decline in personal grooming among those in committed relationships, using Regis Philbin's allegedly long toenails as an example.  They proposed a marriage contract renewal system based on appearance and performance.  A caller, Dan, described his wife's significant weight gain over 21 years and its impact on their sex life, prompting a discussion about postpartum weight gain and its lack of consideration in divorce proceedings.  Further calls detailed similar experiences, with the hosts offering their opinions.  Upcoming guests Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson (phone call) and Stuart Copeland (in-studio) were mentioned.  A news story about a Manhattan bar facing a lawsuit for sexual harassment and discrimination, including forced weigh-ins and body ranking, was discussed, with a DJ from the bar calling in to offer a counterpoint. The segment concluded with ongoing discussion of the lawsuit and speculation about the gender of someone briefly seen nude outside the studio window.

The show continued with a debate on attractiveness as a hiring factor, referencing modeling agencies and bar staff.  The hosts engaged in self-deprecating humor about their own attractiveness and dating lives.  A caller, Steve from Staten Island, argued that appearance should matter in certain jobs, citing the Hooters lawsuit and a man who wanted to be a Hooters waitress.  The conversation then moved to Rosie O'Donnell's time on *The View*, contrasting her past and present personas, with highly critical and offensive comments about O'Donnell, Barbara Walters, and other co-hosts.  The hosts recounted a story about Barbara Walters claiming her dog talked to her, reacting with disbelief and making numerous crude jokes.  A caller shared a story about a dog eating its deceased owner.  Another caller, claiming to be a former Marine, offered his perspective on the rules of engagement in war, sparking a lengthy discussion, punctuated by offensive and inflammatory language, about the absurdity of certain rules and the hosts' belief in a more aggressive approach to war.  The hosts mentioned upcoming appearances by The Rock and Stuart Copeland, with a humorous, chaotic segment involving producer Roland struggling to communicate details about The Rock's call and Copeland's promotional activities.  A brief conversation with Stuart Copeland focused on The Police's potential reunion before abruptly ending.

The in-studio interview with Stuart Copeland centered on his documentary/home movie, *Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out*.  Copeland shared anecdotes from his time with The Police, including a story about playing at Sting's wedding and a recurring DJ nightmare. He discussed the legal complexities of using music in film, citing a situation with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono.  He talked about his film composing work, MTV's early years, and his brother's recent death (which he couldn't discuss). He mentioned his friendship with Lemmy Kilmister and Matt Stone.  Opie and Anthony promoted Copeland's movie and a book signing, describing their subsequent walk through New York City handing out DVDs and encountering a JROTC cadet.  Throughout, Opie and Anthony interspersed promotional plugs and vulgar banter.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of topics and caller interactions, beginning with sexually suggestive comments from the hosts.  A caller mentioned Copeland's brother's death.  Other calls included a correction of a misidentified Police music video, leading to a discussion of Sting's solo work; a caller recounting a potentially illegal encounter with a 16-year-old girl, sparking a debate on legality and ethics with crude jokes and comments from a caller identifying as a police officer; a discussion of a man attempting to open a plane door mid-flight; a clip of a sportscaster dropping F-bombs live on television; a news report about a reporter trying to get people to bark on the street; a clip of Michael Irvin being called a "retard," sparking a debate on offensive language, and a caller sharing a personal story about their daughter with Down syndrome, leading to a shift in tone; a weight-loss contest idea with an extreme penalty involving a stripper and the husband of a participant who fails; and further discussion of clips and calls, all interspersed with frequent use of crude language, sexual innuendo, and offensive jokes.

A segment focused on the proposed weight-loss contest, where a husband would have sex with a stripper if his wife failed to lose weight.  Several female listeners called in, expressing interest and detailing their weight and goals.  Lori called but left abruptly, Stephanie discussed her weight gain after quitting smoking and their willingness to participate, Jeff and Jenna joined with Jenna described as significantly overweight, and Denise also discussed her weight and her husband's reaction. The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive and crude jokes. They also touched on securing sponsors and legal implications. Ryan Starr from *Supernova* called in, discussing his experience and future plans.  The segment ended with criticism of poorly produced promotional announcements for the show's website.

The final segment featured listener calls sharing what they learned that day, ranging from humorous observations to offensive jokes targeting people with disabilities.  Roland, a studio guest, struggled to remember the title of The Rock's new movie ("The Gridiron Gang"), creating a humorous segment. The Rock's impending call was discussed.  The segment concluded with more crude and offensive “lessons learned,” discussion of Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers, and an anecdote about a raccoon biting Opie's testicles.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Relax.  Mike.  Stop it.  Probe or none.  Probe.  I'm here in a second.  You are under arrest.  Do you understand?  For what?  Hailing to stop when signaled by the police.  Stop.  Do you understand?  You're under arrest. 
[00:01:30]  Go ahead.  Go.  Index.  Do it.  Go.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Get on your back.  On your back.  On your stomach.  Get on your stomach.  Pull over.  Give it to him again.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  Put your arms out.  Oh my.  Put your arms out.  Okay.  Okay.  Get it again, Mike.  I'm sorry.  I can't.  I'm sorry, man.  Don't fight, Mike.  I won't.  Relax your hands.  I love that, man. 
[00:02:00]  That's great, isn't it?  Oh.  Do I love that?  From yesterday's program.  A third, what?  A 350-pound guy getting tased twice.  And the second time was even better because he knew it was coming.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Humbina, humbina, humbina.  And that's how we start this morning.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Chiu.  The Opie virus spreading across America, spreading across the world. 
[00:02:30]  Oh my goodness.  We have Andy from England. He's been on hold for a few minutes here. He wants to say hi from England. Andy, what's up?  Hello, Americans.  Good morning, Andy.  Good evening.  Hey, guys. Welcome to this fantastic Whip-I'm-Out Wednesday all across the world, as you say.  Yes.  Yes. How many people have you had calling from England?  England. Not many, but a couple from all over the world. How do you listen to us? 
[00:03:00]  Fantastic. On XM Online. Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  I've got a bit of an FU for XM, actually.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. How come you have to have a U.S. billing address to actually listen to XM Online?  I want to pay for the show.  For the show.  Interesting. I wonder why that is.  I don't know. They got their own thing going on.  Who knows?  Maybe because XM executives don't want to get arrested when they land in England, where 
[00:03:30]  they are for the gambling thing.  Yeah.  It's illegal.  It is.  All right, Andy. Let's get into it.  So what? It's noon over there?  It's about 11 o'clock, yeah.  Oh, it's only five hours? I want to figure that crap out eventually.  All right. So it's 11 o'clock in England. What do you got, Andy?  Well, it's Whip-I'm-Out Wednesday, isn't it?  Now, over here, you're going to see some really horrible, saggy, pasty white British boobs.  But over there in New York and all the way across the coast, you're going to see some 
[00:04:00]  lovely double F fake boobs over there, aren't you?  What, you guys don't get the fake boobs in England?  Not so much, no, no. But then again, we have newspapers where, you know, there's boobs  on page three every single day.  Yeah, we know that. Yeah, the English love their page three chicks.  That's right.  I think we should be on in England. I think we would do well there.  I think so. Boy, though, it's 11 o'clock?  Yeah, 11 o'clock.  Do you have any horse race results or anything we can bet on? You're like in the future. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly, yeah.  Because it's very early in the morning here. You're in the future, so maybe you have some  information that we can use to maybe make money on. How's the stock market doing?  It's crashed. I'd sell it right now.  Damn.  Yeah.  Short everything.  Andy, I got to tell you, if you were calling from Scranton, we would have hung up on you already.  The only reason we're still talking to you is because you're way over there.  Because you got that cool accent.  So, come on, let's go. What do you got? 
[00:05:00]  It's Whip-I'm-Out Wednesday. You want to explain it? That's what I'm assuming here.  Yeah.  All right.  There's a load of different ways you can do it. You can either write it in the back of  your truck, your oversized SUV.  Call it a lorry.  A lorry?  Call it a lorry.  A lorry?  Yeah, your truck.  Yeah, okay.  It's called a lorry over there.  It is. It's called a lorry, as you say. I didn't think you guys would understand what  the hell I was talking about there.  Of course. I watched Monty Python.  Exactly.  I speak English. 
[00:05:30]  So, write it in the back of your truck, or send a self-addressed envelope to the O.P. Anthony  Show USA, and I'm sure it'll get there.  That's all you got to do.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got wacky addresses over there. Can't even read it.  Well, hang on. I wrote down your address, because it sounded wacky. It's like full of  numbers, and 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York 10019. It's like, well, how many  numbers are there in there?  It's called a zip code. Look into it. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we can get you a wow sticker.  That's what won our Revolutionary War, my friend. The zip code.  That's right.  So, yeah.  Too bad we can't tase Andy.  Not holding a grudge on that whole thing, are you?  Hey, what? Sorry?  Not holding a grudge over that whole revolution thing, are you?  Oh, of course not.  Thanks.  You saved our ass in World War II.  You still haven't explained. Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  This call should have taken a minute and a half. We're up to four minutes already. We've 
[00:06:30]  got nothing done. Nothing.  All right. Stick around the back of your lorry, as you say, and when you're driving down the  motorway, then girls will whip out their jubblies.  Ah, their jubblies.  Yes.  Of course. Very good, Andy. Thank you for your explanation.  Yeah.  Thanks for your $18 phone call.  Oh, he's still talking. Yes, Andy.  One more thing as well?  Yes.  One more thing as well?  Yes.  If you go to the iTunes Music Store and go to the video podcast, the Open Anthony Experience 
[00:07:00]  video podcast is in the Featured Items section.  Oh, what does that mean?  Oh. You know, like you keep promoting YouTube. Well, basically, I've been doing the same,  putting all your videos on iTunes as well.  Oh, thank you for that.  Oh, nice.  The good thing is that basically you don't have to download them. All you have to do is subscribe  for free, and they will be downloaded automatically to your computer every time you log on.  Cool. Another way to spread the virus. Thank you, Andy. 
[00:07:30]  There you go. No problem. Punching out.  Oh, I wish you punched out a while ago.  Quite exciting. Thank you.  That's computer magic.  And he has no excuse. He's wide awake. Everyone else, you know, that's listening to us, they're a little sleepy.  A little snoozy.  He's in lunchtime, pretty much, and he's a bore.  Oh, you're still there. Sorry.  All right. Thank you.  Okay. I'm going down in flames. Bye.  All right. There he goes. All right. Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:08:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. Good morning on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes.  Jimmy, your eyes are so bloodshot. You all right?  My contact is bonded to my left one.  Let me see. Look how red it is.  Oh.  I feel like I got something in there. It's been annoying.  It is beyond red.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I got probably the last one in there.  Yeah.  Does it hurt?  Both of your eyes are a little red, though.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, well.  You've been off a little late.  Join the club.  What is that?  What is that?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, what did you just hand Jimmy? 
[00:08:30]  Saline for his eyes.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll go fix this on the break.  All right.  Bug him.  Ew.  You use each other's, like, eye care products?  You don't dip it in there. You just spread it.  You didn't even put this in your awful eyes, did you?  No.  E-Rock licks the top.  Just to get the drops going sometimes, that's all.  Yeah, because it gets a little crusty, so he just gives it a lick or two to make sure  the drops flow.  Go ahead.  Go use it.  We'll wait for you.  No, you won't fight for it.  My eye's really red. 
[00:09:00]  I hope I don't have that stuff again in my eyes.  It is really, really red.  I have medicine.  Yeah.  All right.  What do we got to do today?  Oh, there's plenty of dopey stories to talk about.  You know.  Dopey things.  I hope people were listening to us very closely on Monday when all the news programs, they  were doing their 9-11 coverage, the five-year anniversary, and it was sadness for everybody.  They were being somber.  They were being very, very somber.  And we were pretty much calling them all out saying, this is BS. 
[00:09:30]  They're doing it for ratings, and they'll be back to their silly stories in no time.  Yeah.  And, man, the papers are filled with silly stories.  The news is filled with silly stories.  This caught my eye.  The Daily News.  They had nothing but 9-11 coverage, right?  Yeah.  A mere two days later, you get this little item.  Put a sock on it.  But viewers of Live with Regis and Kelly were treated yesterday to extended close-ups of  Regis Philbin's left foot, including his remarkably long toenails. 
[00:10:00]  Reg had a splinter, and Kelly Ripa spent much of the opening segment digging it out.  Had a splinter.  A splinter.  And they showed, like, his long, yellow, old man toenails.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, if you're going to take your shoe off on national television, perhaps you should 
[00:10:30]  do a little toenail grooming.  No, well, no, it's great, too.  Living in New York, you get a chance to, you know, watch a lot of TV shows being, you know,  taped.  Yeah.  And especially people on Long Island who relate to this, the trains are filled with all these,  like, fat housewives coming into the city for the day to see the taping of The View.  I want to see Dr. Phil.  Or Tony Danza when he was on the air.  Yeah.  Or, I don't know, stand outside the Today Show. 
[00:11:00]  See Regis.  Regis.  And they get all dressed up.  Letterman.  They get all dressed up, and they talk about where they're going to eat after the taping,  and it's a big day in the city.  Yeah.  And they sit down in the audience, and they get treated to watching Regis get a splinter  out of his old man foot.  And they kept, like, I wish I got to see that audio.  Yeah, we're trying to find it.  We're trying to find the video.  They kept doing close-ups on his foot.  And he just had really, really long toenails. 
[00:11:30]  And Kelly was just digging away, digging away.  People got to clip those things.  That's what, like, let me tell you something.  That's what being married.  He's married to Joy, right?  Yeah.  My wife of 800 years, Joy!  What, do they sleep like Ricky and Lucy in separate beds?  Because that's what keeps a guy kind of groomed and where you're not clipping your toenails.  When you're with a girl that you care about. 
[00:12:00]  When you're married a few years, it's over, Johnny.  Those big toenails grow.  You're lacerating her Achilles tendon when rolling over.  Big, nasty razor blade toenail.  Oh.  It's just, have you noticed that, you take care of yourself pretty well.  Yeah, my toenails are not the best, though.  They're a little longer than they probably should be.  But aside from that and the fact that I don't wear condoms, I mean, I'm pretty unconscious.  When you, like, get a girl that you care about, if you've got a girlfriend, something like that, 
[00:12:30]  do you notice you maybe take care of yourself a little better?  You clip the toenails.  You, you know, you take care of yourself a little better.  You watch what you eat.  Yeah.  You get haircuts.  Things like that.  You go to the dentist.  Right.  I care on the way into the relationship.  I care when I'm trying to get a relationship.  Once I have one, I'm finished.  Once you get it, you're done?  Yeah.  There isn't a honeymoon period, as they call it?  A little bit.  But then once I know that you're going to, like, once I know that you're going to take  your panties off regardless, no, I'm not doing it anymore. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  That's the opposite.  Because usually it's just the other way where, you know, old couples that have been married  for years, they just give up.  Opie's brought up a great point to how the women cut their hair off.  Can I explain how you can see audio?  So, see, here at the Opie and Anthony Show, we actually see audio.  We get video clips.  Yes.  And we're seeing and listening at the same time.  So that's how you see audio.  I do believe I corrected myself, too. 
[00:13:30]  They pick up on everything.  I look at waveforms every day.  Look, here's an experiment.  You get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and get a little group of your friends together  on a corner.  Give it a whirl.  And give it a whirl and just try to talk.  Just try to talk.  Just try to have words come out of your mouth.  And have your friends keep track of every single word you try to say at 4 in the morning,  5 in the morning, even 6 in the morning.  I know I corrected myself.  I said, see, I got to see that audio.  I mean video.  Whatever. 
[00:14:00]  When it comes out.  I was with you.  Who cares?  Someone's chastising me.  I get it.  Go screw.  Anyway, sorry.  Yeah, so people, when they get into a relationship, then they let themselves go.  Yeah, they let themselves go with big, like big Regis toenails.  It's the only reason he's got big, long toenails, because he doesn't care that Joy sees him  walking around the house, shuffling around in a robe, probably.  Could I have a cup of coffee?  Just leaving scratch marks in the wood floor from his toenails, like a velociraptor, tapping  to click, click, click, click, click, looking for young children. 
[00:14:30]  Click, click, click.  Oh, that's what happens.  Well, the haircut is our favorite.  Oh, the women.  It's such a sensible haircut.  It's so easy to take care of.  Look, man, there's a lot of people getting ready to go on the Long Island Railroad.  Yeah.  Well, we'll keep it local for New York.  We don't do that often, actually, even though we broadcast from New York.  On the Long Island Railroad, if you go in later, actually, because you've got all the businessmen  coming in and the businesswomen that have to look like hot pieces of asses so they can 
[00:15:00]  get their raises.  Right, break through that glass ceiling.  So you're not going to see the women with the really short haircuts in the morning.  But later on in the day, if you're one of those people that have to take a train a little  later on, you'll be on a train with all these people coming in to watch a taping of some  TV show and just count all the sensible haircuts you'll see on the train.  It's sensible.  I have to get out of the house, make sure all my kids are off to school, and then get 
[00:15:30]  out of the house and do my errands.  So I can't really spend time washing a big, long, lustrous head of hair like I used to  have.  So I've chopped it all off, I've given myself a crew cut, and I'm sure your husband loves  it.  I want a girl who's a whore, who has to feather her hair and look good no matter where she  goes.  I like that.  A nice, nice head of hair on a girl.  Isn't that nice?  Something to grab onto. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Something to run your hands through.  You know, this marriage thing, you should be able to renew your marriage.  We talk about this from time to time.  Get a license renewal, like after with your car.  Yeah, like after, you know, you sign a contract.  Yeah.  Maybe you're brave enough when you're getting ready to get married, you go, you know what,  I'll sign a 10-year contract with you.  And then you gotta re-up.  And then after 10 years, you renegotiate.  Yeah.  Like everything else in this life.  It's like sports, as long as you're performing.  Right.  Then you're gonna get paid.  Your team is gonna re-up you, and you're gonna get paid, and things are gonna work out. 
[00:16:30]  And you get bonuses if you do it the way it's supposed to be done.  Right.  You know?  Like if you wear, you dress a certain way, like crotchless panties, and you know, you  keep your skin a certain weight.  That's it.  And this should go for both sides.  If not, you get black eyes.  Because the guys wind up looking like old women.  Big guts on them.  Something happens.  They lose all testosterone, and they look like old women.  And you're not getting re-upped.  The wife or the husband, if it's happening to him, turns and goes, you know, I'm looking 
[00:17:00]  over your past performance now over the past couple of years, and you're just not, you're  not performing.  Can we do something today?  Actually, Dan came up with it.  I can't take credit for this one.  Dan in New Jersey.  I got an idea after Dan's phone call, though.  Go ahead, Dan.  All right.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Amen.  Yeah.  You know, I married a stripper, and after years, the hair got shorter.  The weight went on, and what happened to my balls? 
[00:17:30]  You know?  I'm pretty much gone, but that's all I got for you guys this morning.  I'm punching out.  No, no, no.  I'm going to take your phone call, and we're going to do something fun today for the next  half hour.  Dan, how much did she weigh when you got married?  She was a stripper.  She was a stripper.  About 118, 119.  Hot.  How many years have you been married?  21.  Wow.  21 years.  How much does she weigh now? 
[00:18:00]  241.  Holy God.  You're kidding, right?  No.  No, I'm not kidding.  The hair used to be long and blonde, and now she looks like a bull bite.  Two.  Oh, my God.  She doubled her size.  She did double her size.  She doubled her weight.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Easily.  She gained 123 pounds in 20 years.  She's still a stripper, but now she's stripping cow carcasses of their flesh.  Let me see if we can make lemonade out of lemons. 
[00:18:30]  Is she made of gold?  That's the only way that would work.  Look at all the gold I have now.  She eats cows like we eat sushi.  Nice.  Oh, that is a shame, man.  You're not kidding, right, Dan?  It is.  I mean, you know, two kids later, I, you know, I've seen people with four kids later.  All right.  We got a lot of women screaming at their radios right now.  Dan, how much did you weigh when you got married?  178.  How much do you weigh now, 21 years later? 
[00:19:00]  179.  He gained a pound.  Wow.  He's gained a pound.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  See, you know, maybe it's a small deal.  Marriage should be a contract.  I'm telling you, if you're brave enough to, you know, sign a 10-year contract, great.  But maybe you should start in, like, five years.  Five-year contract.  After five years, you decide what you want to do at that point.  Dan, do you say anything?  Did you say anything?  Was it because of the kids so you couldn't say anything? 
[00:19:30]  What happened?  You must have noticed, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the poundage went on for the first pregnancy.  I said, you know, it's baby fat.  She's going to lose it later on.  And then the hair went short.  Oh, boy.  And you knew it was over.  She gave up.  Yeah.  And, I mean, the second, you know, I love the kids.  Die for them.  The second one comes around, comes and goes.  And what happened?  Wow.  Wow.  It was just, I don't know, maybe just a food fest or depression or whatever.  I've noticed it takes a lot for a woman to snap back after a kid. 
[00:20:00]  It takes a lot of, like, real work.  And some of them just can't do it.  Some of them don't want to.  And some of them don't want to.  They're like, I got what I wanted.  They don't want to.  They're done.  They don't want to get back into shape.  They've got what they want.  They've got their husband.  They've got their kids.  They don't need to get back in shape.  They've got the house.  You know, they're not interested in any sort of career.  So, you know, Oprah and Phil and all those guys, you know, screw them.  Sit on the couch a little bit longer.  Dan, can I ask you a personal question here? 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  When was the last time you enjoyed having sex with your wife?  Oh, man.  Boy, are you hitting a sore spot.  Oh, no.  All this poor bastard.  Yeah.  Where's the plane flaming now?  It's been a long time since I've rocked in the moonlight.  You just get, you know, you just can't get down there anymore and go, man, this is not  what it used to be.  Do you mean you still, do you guys still have sex or she won't even have it with you? 
[00:21:00]  Or you just don't really care about having it with her?  Say it again.  I lost you.  Do you like having sex with her or she doesn't want to?  No.  I do it out of, you know, necessity.  It's biological reason.  Yeah, I mean, you know, there's just so much fun you can have with, you know, artificial  whatevers.  And I'm like, you know, hey, I'm at the juncture in my life right now where it's just like if  you're, if she was game right now, I'd have to give her a mercy one.  How's that? 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  Dan, I just did some math for you.  You've been married 21 years.  You realize your wife has gained about six pounds a year.  That's all it is.  A little six pounds a year.  It starts creeping up on you.  Six pounds in one year.  That's nothing.  That's nothing.  You don't notice that.  Year after year after year.  Year after year.  And then what did you do?  Dan, what did you do at one point?  You looked over at your wedding picture that was somewhere in the house and gone, where'd  that girl go?  No, no, no, guys.  When I got married, she gave me a calendar. 
[00:22:00]  Okay?  Yeah.  I still have it.  And you still look at it?  The glory days?  Oh, the glory days.  And then if you try to get a divorce, they're not even going to take into consideration.  Consideration that your wife gained 123 pounds.  No, you'll look like the bad guy.  You'll be the bad guy if that ever came up.  You know, I haven't even thought about bringing the calendar over to my attorney yet.  You know?  His wife was on a calendar.  This is what I signed up for.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is what I got myself into, not this. 
[00:22:30]  Wait a minute, Mr. Attorney.  You've met my wife, Attila the Hun.  You know?  You want to check her out when she was a fine snapper?  You know?  Weight should be a consideration in divorce cases.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yep.  You think I can use that?  Look, I understand.  People gain a little weight as they get older.  I get that.  But your wife went from 118 to 241 pounds.  Yep.  That's not what you signed up for. 
[00:23:00]  That's double plus five.  Listen, I bought her a house and she turned into one.  All right, Dan.  Hang in there.  Hey, guys, listen.  I'm going to punch out.  I appreciate all your good advice.  And listen, I've been a fan and I've got all of it.  So I've been with you guys since day one in New York.  Good luck, man.  Thank you, my friend.  Of course you're in a pool of stingrays.  All right, listen.  I'll catch up to Jimmy Norton later.  You guys rock.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  There he goes, Dan.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  When we get back, I think we should take more of these phone calls. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And don't lie.  It's not going to help anyone out today.  No.  What did your wife weigh when you got married?  What does she weigh now?  And the women could get involved in this, too.  Of course they can, you ladies.  But we don't do a radio show for women.  It ain't for broads.  This is a male's point of view.  In our sick minds, every girl should be a stripper.  That's right.  And I like it when you're anorexic, so don't call crying about it. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, make me so sick.  Good.  If you gain more than five pounds when you're pregnant, we don't like you.  Story in the paper about a bar.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into that.  Yeah.  We got lots of good things to do today.  All right.  Also today, we got The Rock calling in.  We got...  The Rock.  The Rock or Dwayne?  Well, I guess he's Dwayne these days, right?  It's Dwayne.  It's pretty much Dwayne now, forever.  Stuart Copeland in studio.  Ooh.  From the police. 
[00:24:30]  Of course.  He's got a DVD out.  I guess backstage footage he was taking over the years.  Yeah.  When he was in the police and he's got a DVD out or coming out like, I don't know, in  a day or two.  He's stopping by around 8 o'clock today.  We got lots to do.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to a successful  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of Wow Stickers and 2x4s.  Solid as a rock. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured.  It's Opie and Anthony!  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

[00:25:30]  Lots of instant feedback coming in right now.  Kenny from Elizabeth.  You guys are right.  I should have signed a contract.  My wife is a fat pig.  Oh.  I wouldn't say that to her face because I love her.  But it has to stop.  We have sex about once a month.  Oh, no.  We have sex about once a mouth.  I've been married nine years.  I have four kids.  She is 5'1 and 110.  That's what she was.  He wrote this weird. 
[00:26:00]  I have four kids.  He's in shock.  He should have wrote, she was 5'1 and 110 pounds.  All right.  Now she weighs 219 pounds.  At 5'1, she's 219.  You should actually be legally allowed to kill her.  Yeah, I think you are.  Oh.  219.  What do you do?  It should be a contract.  I'm telling you.  And you re-up.  Because he probably, you know, he probably does still love her and stuff. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  You know, he's got to go home and just, oh, God, what happened?  Not as much as she loves food.  Exactly.  Here's what you should do.  You put a pie by the steps and you tie a little string by the bottom.  And when Fatso runs for it, she trips and she dies with her face.  Like, as she's going for the pie, she just falls down the stairs and her face passes it as she's falling.  And she sees what she loves right before her neck breaks.  Tries to take a couple of bites out of it.  Misses.  Breaks her neck.  Yeah, she doesn't even try to prop herself up. 
[00:27:00]  Her teeth just go.  You just hear.  Snap, snap, chatter, chatter.  She's falling.  She goes to the left.  Trying to get one last bite in before she drops dead.  That looks delicious.  She gets a whiff of that pie tin.  Hey, let's go to Earl in Connecticut.  Earl.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, my wife, I got the opposite problem.  My wife actually went from heavy to being incredibly fit.  What do you mean?  What happened?  Well, when we met, she was a little on the heavy side. 
[00:27:30]  I've been with her for 13 years.  And at one point, she was up to almost 300 pounds.  That's a little on the heavy side?  Yeah, exactly.  Where did you live, Jupiter?  Fat woman.  You married a dock worker.  She wasn't that when we met.  She's Lee J. Cobb, sir.  Over the years, she got heavy.  And then she got in this health kick and got down to a size 8.  I think she went from a 28 to an 8 and actually got muscles.  So how much does she weigh now? 
[00:28:00]  Well, she's actually put a little back on.  I think she's around 200.  So she has about 80 pounds to go.  She's on her way.  Next time, she'll go even thinner.  I got to say, guys, you know, I love the big girls.  You guys picked on them, but I personally love them.  Do you really ask?  Why?  Are you a skinny guy?  I'm a little husky.  But even when I was younger, and I'm probably about 215 now, but even when I was younger,  I don't know what it is.  I just love curvaceous, voluptuous women.  Yeah, exactly.  I like that, too.  But I don't like fat girls. 
[00:28:30]  Now, people don't like fat girls.  Are you afraid of being left by a woman?  Well, see, I kind of had to deal with that, because after she lost weight, a lot of other  guys were interested in her that were technically previously out of her league, so to speak.  And she actually left me about six months ago, got her own apartment, and she came back.  She came back.  That's terrific.  Why did she leave you?  Why did she leave you?  Well, it's 13 years.  You know, it wasn't overweight.  Did you lock the cupboard? 
[00:29:00]  It's just we've been together a long time, and I'm pretty much the only guy she's been.  I wanted her to go out and actually be with somebody else, just to see if the grass was  greener, to be honest with you.  Did you really?  Is that what you're telling yourself so you don't feel emasculated?  I wanted her to go out and have sex with a few black guys, just to let her know what  she had home.  A cuckold.  She had a cuckold.  I got to let the big white women out there know that they don't have to settle for a  black guy.  There's plenty of white guys who love him.  They don't have to settle.  I don't, I don't, wait, why would you, she left and came back. 
[00:29:30]  Why would you take her back?  She came crawling back.  She listened to the show.  What guy, what guy wants his woman to leave him to see if it's greener?  Because she's never been with another guy.  Are you nuts?  If you love something, let it go.  Exactly.  If it comes back, shut up.  That's stupid saying.  If you love something, let it go.  She must have loved cake.  You let it go and it came back and aimed for her mouth.  How does that dump home end? 
[00:30:00]  If you love something, let it go.  If it comes back.  If it comes back.  It was meant to be.  Something like that.  It was yours.  If it doesn't come back.  It was something.  It never was.  Something about two sets of footprints.  No, that's why did you leave me in my most.  She leaves you so now there's one foot of footprints and you can't carry her because she's a fat pig.  There's a big set of footprints with water in it that jiggles when she walks in the cup in the SUV.  Right.  If you love something, let it go. 
[00:30:30]  If it comes back, it was yours.  If it doesn't, it would have been yours.  But then.  But then the two donuts in a hand equals what?  Something about a bush.  Right.  You guys are horrible, you know.  Sir.  Yeah.  My concern is.  We just don't like the fatties.  What can I tell you?  I love them.  We understand there's guys out there that love the fatties.  That's got to be the number one fetish.  It's got to be the number one fetish is guys that dig fetch it.  I want to get the number one fetish is the foot fetish.  Stop it already.  No, I don't think so.  Stop it already.  I don't think so. 
[00:31:00]  I think it's chubby chasers.  There's fat women out there wearing an obese nation and fat women are getting action.  Who's doing it?  Sir, why do you like fat women?  I don't get it.  I can't even tell you.  It's just at the core of, I guess.  I don't know.  Who was your mother like?  My mother was a health nut.  It makes no sense.  We can't figure it out.  My brother's a jock and can get pretty much any girl he wants.  And his past two girls have been on the big side.  Maybe you guys hate your mother, so you're getting the opposite of her. 
[00:31:30]  Maybe she was an emasculating, rotten health nut.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a physical thing with a mother.  It could be like a mental thing where you needed a little more attention and this big  motherly type woman.  Hey, at the Thanksgiving Day table, does everyone kind of awkwardly look down as your wife keeps  going back for thirds and fourths?  She's got a bunch of her butt.  There's always one of those at the table where you look over and go, haven't you had enough,  you slob?  You're just make-believe.  Yeah, can't figure out why you're fat. 
[00:32:00]  This is delicious.  I'm just going to have another little slice.  Yeah, I'm sure you are.  Let me just have one more of these, and it's a turkey.  So she went out.  What did you do while she was out with her face in a pillow?  It wasn't in the pillow.  I was over there.  I ended up being over there every other day, but I was trying to go meet women, too.  And I just, believe it or not, surprise, surprise, my confidence level was pretty low after  my wife left me.  Okay.  So I had some conversations, but we ended up just getting back together and realizing 
[00:32:30]  I guess it was meant to be.  Yeah, you struck out horribly.  She went out and gobbled on a few.  Now all is well.  I love her.  What can I say?  How many people did she sleep with?  None.  I think she tried to sleep with a couple.  Tried to?  Yeah, sure she did.  It's part of the injustice of the whole breaking up thing or the girl leaving or something  like that, because you know, that night, she could be out getting a guy and getting  some action, and for the most part, a guy can't just run out unless he's paying and seduce 
[00:33:00]  a woman into sleeping with him.  All right.  Cody's going to explain the love for fat girls, I guess.  Cody, what's up?  Hey, morning, buddy.  It's Indiana, by the way.  Oh.  Yeah, thank God, right?  Anyway, the proclivity to fat women could usually be, A, I'm a big guy myself, so I  kind of know that my options are limited, but there's that aspect of it.  The other part is that a lot of them are big-breasted, and if you have a breast fetish, that kind 
[00:33:30]  of always ties in with most fat girls.  Fat girls' big breasts are not good.  Well, not necessarily fat girls.  You know, I like...  Not sometimes good.  One of the funniest things to see as I walk the streets in New York are the fatties with  no boobs.  Ah, yeah.  We call them flat-sos?  A flat-so.  A flat-so.  Nothing sadder than the flat-so.  Because a lot of women out there that gain weight, they're like, well, at least I got these 
[00:34:00]  huge jugs that are attractive to the male species.  They got these little, little A's or B's on this gigantic moose frame.  Yeah, that's so terrible.  We openly laugh at flat-so's.  You know, it's the thicker women, the voluscious pin-up ties with the actual nice big bosoms.  Yeah.  So, yeah, that's what I like.  But I'll punch you out, fellas.  Have a good day.  All right.  Rosie O'Donnell is a flat-so.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Sharon. 
[00:34:30]  Female point of view here.  Sharon.  Sharon in Connecticut.  Hi, Sharon.  How are you guys?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  We've pegged her voice.  How you doing?  I think every guy needs to have their wife listen to O&A.  That way, they will keep their hair long and keep the weight off so their husbands don't  call.  I agree.  That's our goal, to not get any calls about this.  Here's what I want.  If I ever have kids, I want to be married to the type of girl, like, I'll come home one 
[00:35:00]  day and the kid's head will be mushed from laying in the crib on one side for too  long, and I'll go, what happened?  And she'll go, oh, I was in the mirror fixing my makeup.  Chee-hee!  I want to do a contest.  I want to find a couple out there that is willing to do this.  Yeah?  You get a wife that's way overweight.  Yeah.  And you give her a month to lose, like, 100 pounds.  100 pounds in a month?  100 pounds?  That's like kidney failure.  All right.  How about a month to lose 50 pounds? 
[00:35:30]  Can you do that?  All right.  We didn't, this, we haven't brought this idea to the lab yet, the Opie and Anthony lab.  The lab.  The institute.  The institute.  All right.  So my numbers might be a little off.  All right.  Okay.  So how about 50 pounds in a month?  That's a pound, that's a pound and a half a day, something like that?  And if the woman does not lose the 50 pounds in a month, the guy gets to bang a stripper  in front of her.  Would that be the greatest contest ever? 
[00:36:00]  Would that be the greatest contest ever?  Who would be?  Hey, that is a good one, man.  And again, does it have to be in front of her?  It would wreck the vibe for him to have that big fat face staring in.  It might actually do good though, that like the guy might, might enjoy that more.  Okay.  Like, hey, see what you did?  You know?  That's the bit.  God, that's a good idea.  Screw Celebrity Fit Club.  That is.  We get a few couples.  There's some consequences with this one.  That's right.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  I like that.  Hey, we got money to throw around, right?  Yeah, we do.  We own some people on the papers.  Yeah.  I'd like a story like that.  Dirty cop?  Fat wife?  Hey, by the way, if there's any fat women out there that want to call in and defend yourselves,  I mean, having a kid is probably hard and stuff.  So, I mean, we'll let you talk.  We're not going to jump on you.  No, absolutely not.  We won't jump on you.  We won't even look at you.  But, you know, I mean, I know it's like this was one point of view.  So any women out there want to call in.  And we promise not to do a lot of weight jobs.  We usually, I mean, I could predict some of the calls we're going to get. 
[00:37:00]  The women that call up and say, well, what about the guys that go to hell?  Right.  Absolutely.  After marriage.  And, of course.  Let's go to Steve in Arkansas.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  I got that typical story, man.  When I married my woman 21 years ago, she was 5'1", pretty much weighed right at 100 pounds.  Perfect cantaloupe breast.  Just a petite little thing.  Here it is 21 years later.  And she weighs 214 pounds.  She's got a Moe Howard haircut, not just short hair.  Moe Howard haircut. 
[00:37:30]  She's got the back.  You know how they kind of, Moe's hair was kind of shaved from the back of his, half of the back of his head down?  Yeah.  Oh, she thinks that's hot.  And all she talks about is food.  We'll be at a restaurant eating dinner, and she'll talk about what she's going to fix at home.  We're going to be sitting around eating breakfast, and she talks about what she's going to have for lunch.  Oh, boy.  The only thing she reads is magazines with pictures of, well, I call it reading.  She looks at magazines all day long with pictures of food. 
[00:38:00]  She's obsessed, man.  The only time she watches TV, if I'm watching TV and she walks by and it's a Burger King commercial or something, she's just transfixed.  That's like porno for her.  Like the way normally a guy would look at porno, she's looking at food as if it's pornography.  It's Pavlovian.  She's fucking slobbering.  Oh, God.  I mean, the sad part of it is that somebody was, and I have been asked by old buddies and stuff, why are you still fucking with her? 
[00:38:30]  I used to say it was because of my kids, but now they're out of the house.  The sad part of it is that I actually kind of still like the fucking beach ball.  I'm at a dump.  You've got to stop cursing.  You've got to stop cursing.  It's hilarious, but you've got to stop cursing, man.  I'm sorry, boys, but I had to agree with Andy.  That one guy who called in and goes, oh, I know why guys like heavier chicks because they have big breasts.  Yeah.  She's got the big breasts, but it looks like an old man's butt, you know? 
[00:39:00]  She's so heavy, man.  Well, I don't know if you can use this word.  Is this really your wife?  Probably not.  The end of the breast, that part, it's inverted like an innie belly button.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Lay on, boys.  Call back again.  You're all right.  What a disaster.  Charlie from Jersey.  We're on to something here.  Charlie.  Hey, how you doing?  I hope you're in Anthony.  Pretty good.  Great show.  Hey, like your previous caller, I really can't stand fat women, especially when they get in  their mid-50s. 
[00:39:30]  They get that haircut that he's talking about.  You can't tell whether they're a guy or a girl.  Yeah.  It's like they've got pillows stuffed in the back of their pants.  That's especially awful.  You're right.  Especially.  And when they defend themselves, they say, oh, I've been battling this horrible disease  all my life like it's something noble.  It's just that they have to push away from the plate.  They keep feeding the wrong hole, which gets them set in the wrong direction from the word  go. 
[00:40:00]  And they eat baby little portions in front of you.  But when you, I see them driving to work in the truck and they are just pushing the donuts  and the french fries down their throat until I get home and have that small portion.  Yeah.  A lot of them will do that.  They'll still eat like real small portions or salad or something like that.  And then alone, it's just nothing but purge.  It takes a lot of discipline to eat right.  Binge and no purge.  I try to eat right.  It's a pain in the ass.  It really is a pain in the ass. 
[00:40:30]  I eat oatmeal with blueberries every morning.  And I'm not saying I never eat bad, but do you think I want to eat this?  I would much rather have a nice bowl of stupid cereal.  I would love to.  Even cereals, a lot of the cereals aren't bad.  I would love to have donuts every morning.  I mean, honey nut.  Something honey.  Endemans chocolate donut.  How about famous Amos cookies are great and Oreos.  Just, I would be shoving these down my mouth every morning.  I'm not fat, you know.  I don't know you're not. 
[00:41:00]  I'm not fat, but, you know, I try to eat right.  It's a pain in the neck.  I would love to just sit around and tell the interns to go to Krispy Kreme.  Yeah.  You kidding me?  Grab a dozen donuts.  Just going to sit here and eat donuts.  We're miserable to begin with because of our stupid hours.  It would be so easy to sit here and just feed our faces.  It's called discipline.  It's a pain in the neck.  The most successful radio guys are not fat, I noticed.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Well, mine-  Rush Limbaugh?  Yeah, I don't count really him, though, because I'm talking about that genre of political. 
[00:41:30]  He lost weight, too.  Yeah.  He's a rare case.  Most of them are not fat.  My dad's heart problems started in, like, the 93.  He had open heart surgery, and that's when I changed my ways.  I'm like, I don't, you know, it's in my family history.  I got to stop.  I used to go to the fast food restaurants and all that.  I used to eat whatever I wanted, dessert every night, all that crap.  Fried food.  Yes.  When you see your dad in a hospital bed after, you know, open heart surgery, you're like,  you know what?  Maybe that's motivation.  Maybe I'll go to McDonald's every once in a while now instead of, like, you know, once, 
[00:42:00]  twice a week.  Yeah.  You know what I have for dessert?  I have berries.  Forget about it.  Berries.  You're like a little koala bear.  I certainly am, and I'm as cute as one, ladies.  Hey, do we have time for the fat story, or should we take a break?  We should probably take a break.  I will take a break.  We'll try to stay on schedule for once.  There's a restaurant here in New York that's in a lot of trouble because of what we're talking  about, pretty much.  Yeah, they were weighing the waitresses or something like that.  I said anus. 
[00:42:30]  Did you?  I don't know.  It's early.  Go to Brian in O-Town.  My eyes are open.  I got to correct him.  Correct him.  All right.  Or he's got to correct me.  Also, people killing stingrays.  That's just terrific.  Perfect.  Operation Kaboom.  Wait till you hear that story.  Operation Kaboom.  And then we got to talk about the front page of the post.  That's pretty ridiculous as well.  Yeah.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[00:43:00]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing  down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But my asses are still juicy and perky.  Please wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:43:30]  Savage animals!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I still say that was a dude.  I got a quick glimpse.  That's what I said.  It was a dude.  I mean, oh, yeah.  Dude looked like a lady.  I'm an ass.  I still say it's a chick.  No.  I said dude because you were yelling and screaming at me during the break.  You say dude.  I say chick.  It was a quick glimpse.  Kenny.  Oh, Kenny's taking a phone call now. 
[00:44:00]  His job is to look at that window and see what turns up because I say it's a dude.  $20.  I say it's a chick.  All right.  If it's a dude, then he has awful man boobs.  He's a dude with awful man boobs because I saw him from the side and from the back.  You can't tell me that one bit.  It was a quick glimpse.  And that was dude.  It was a quick glimpse.  I was thinking chick, but I needed a little more information.  Immediately, you're jumping all over me saying I'm looking at naked dudes. 
[00:44:30]  I called you a homosexual.  How about $20?  I say chick.  You say dude.  All right.  $20.  That is definitely a dude.  For the new listeners here in New York, we got a studio that faces lots and lots of buildings.  And every once in a while, you get to see some nudeness.  T-Rock, use the binoculars.  If you get amorous, we know it's a dude.  I say chick.  You say dude.  If he slowly starts pushing away from the window. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  We got to get into some things.  This story is great.  Yeah, this kind of thing.  It's about a restaurant.  We were talking about.  Here in Manhattan.  Listen to this.  I really was and still am kind of shocked that this sort of thing still goes on in this day and age.  25-year-old Alexandria Lipton says she was fired from this trendy Eastside bar because she objected to the way managers treated her and her fellow waitresses. 
[00:45:30]  He seems to get a very big kick out of treating women like dirt and upsetting them and making them feel uncomfortable emotionally and physically.  Lipton and another former Sutton Place waitress are filing a multi-million dollar lawsuit for sexual harassment, inappropriate touching, and discrimination.  Specifically, Lipton alleges her bosses at this bar would force waitresses to get weighed, rate their overall look from face to body shape, and rank them best to worst. 
[00:46:00]  So the manager at that point let her laugh at the meeting of the office, literally picked her up and attempted to put her on the scale.  She physically resisted, and as a result, went and reported them to the other waitresses.  That's when she was fired.  I felt astonished, upset, discriminated, demeaned, demoralized, and really stressed out.  The borrower says he will fight these charges, and if it goes to court, the bar will prevail. 
[00:46:30]  You're a waitress.  Then go back to school if you want more respect.  Regardless if this is right, wrong, or whatever, the nerve that they feel this is worth millions upon millions of dollars is ridiculous.  I do side with the women on this one, though.  I can just picture this scumbag bar owner or whoever he was.  You're like one of those really douche guys who just likes to embarrass chicks. 
[00:47:00]  No respect.  Yeah, he's a scumbag.  But when you know that right away and then just quit and move on, before it gets to this point where you're completely humiliated,  then the guy's just going to have a bar full of pigs.  Have you ever been in a job and you're like, oh, this is an awful situation.  This guy's an ass, or this female boss, whatever, I'll keep it fair, is an ass, and you just move on.  See, this is a situation where no one wants to take responsibility for their actions.  He's an idiot, but you stayed there long enough where you were affected. 
[00:47:30]  You know, this woman's rattling off all kinds of words.  I felt humiliated, upset, astonished.  What, all in one day?  Leave.  Leave your job.  But a lot of times there's something like sexual harassment is going on.  You can't just, like, if you're at a firm or whatever, and the boss is doing something really, like, that's genuinely inappropriate,  sometimes the answer isn't just to leave.  It's just, you know, like, that's different.  Yeah, because you're making $200,000 a year.  Yeah, that's different.  I'm talking about a bar.  There's plenty of bartender girls. 
[00:48:00]  I thought my own mom tended bar and raised three kids, believe me.  And she got to put up with a bunch of jackass bosses over the years.  And a lot of pinching of the ass, right?  Hey, hey, that was just me when she came home.  I gave her a little tap.  Nice work, ma.  Where's the cash?  You holding out on me, bitch?  But, you know, when you attend a bar, there are other jobs elsewhere where perhaps you get a more respectful boss,  and then this guy's going to be left with, you know, slobs in his bar. 
[00:48:30]  No one's going to want to go in there.  But no.  What if it's the chick looking for an easy payday?  Exactly.  There's another thing.  Because we got Mike who says he's a DJ there.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I'm actually a DJ there on Friday nights at, like, the happy hour.  And the waitresses are hot, man.  I've got to tell you, this is smoking.  Yeah, you know something?  There is something to be said, without being an ass.  There is something to be said for a bar owner wanting hot chicks as bartenders and waitresses. 
[00:49:00]  I agree.  And having weight limits put on them.  I agree.  If they gain weight, you fire them because...  Why are you firing me?  Ah, we're kind of slowing down or something.  You don't even have to say it because you're getting fat, but...  Being a bar and restaurant owner...  Oh, oh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village out there on Long Island.  I'm a silent partner, Anthony.  I'm very silent.  I don't lift a finger to help my brother out at all. 
[00:49:30]  No.  My brother works like an animal 70, 80 hours a week, easily.  Anyway, but all kidding aside, we have noticed that the hot bartender brings in the people.  Of course.  It's just a fact in the bar and restaurant business.  My brother has lots of bartenders.  The guy bartenders don't do as well as the hot chick dressing a little sexy behind the bar.  I've seen it over the years a thousand times.  The chick behind the bar with the little skirt, the nice low-cut shirt, taking care of herself, looking good. 
[00:50:00]  She's going to pull in more customers, more tips, and they're going to buy more booze.  I agree with you.  I mean, I'm not saying like the Borgata guy crapped for that in the Atlantic City for wanting to waitress just to not be a bunch of fatos.  The Borgata babes.  I'm not saying that's wrong.  I'm talking about the guy picking them up and putting them on the scale.  If she's telling the truth, let's just say she is, if he's harassing them, I don't know if he was, but if he was doing that and playing grab-ass and stuff, then they have the right to cause a problem. 
[00:50:30]  I wouldn't want my girlfriend to subject it to that.  No, no.  You go there and pop them in the head.  Hey, how you doing?  She's one of those dopes.  Go there and smack them.  But you're hiring.  I think you're hiring if you own a bar like you're hiring a certain look.  Yeah.  And the girls have to know that.  They're dressing the part when they're going in for the job.  When a lot of bartenders go in for a job, the girls dress the part.  They dress in little outfits, nice and showing a lot of skin because they know that that's part of the job. 
[00:51:00]  And then they get upset if they put on a few pounds and the guy tells them to get lost.  All right.  Let's go to –  I think there's more to this story, though.  Yeah, I think this guy sounds like he's kind of being –  Yeah, we'll find out.  Any women that say, like, well, you shouldn't have to be judged on your – why not?  I mean, should modeling agencies be forced to hire fat shows for shoots or ugly people?  Yeah.  I mean, believe me, I have a discrimination suit.  I've never been hired to shoot for a suit or a catalog. 
[00:51:30]  Why is that okay to only pick attractive people?  Yeah.  You know, where people are eating, you should be able to look like what you want.  Exactly.  There you go.  I made a point.  You certainly did.  Some guy from his mobile device, very hurtful.  Opie is a silent partner when the two of you were on Letterman.  Never going to live that one down.  Did I say restaurant instead of restaurant?  It's early.  Restaurant is fine.  Is it?  That's a fine pronunciation of the word. 
[00:52:00]  Yes, it is.  I say restaurant.  Some people go restrink.  By the way, a little known fact, we hired Jimmy because of his looks.  Yes.  Absolutely correct.  Mm-hmm.  That's why these two have hot chicks.  I was the magnet.  Oh, yeah.  Like, they bounce off of me.  Like, when the hot girls come around, they're just kind of like, meh.  Like, they bounce off me into one of these two.  They're heading your way.  They turn around quickly and get as far away from you as possible.  And then, hello, they bang right into us.  You can't even use that excuse.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, you got a hot one.  Exactly.  I do, but there's got to be something wrong with her mentally.  And I haven't figured it out yet.  Yeah, I've circumnavigated that yet.  Yeah, because she really likes me.  And I'm like, wow, she really, like, likes me as a person.  And I'm like, all right, we'll get to the bottom of this.  Eventually.  One day I'm going to walk in.  Oh, it's going to be a doozy.  One day I'm going to walk in, and she'll be in the kitchen nude, throwing her own waist around.  Yelling, who are you?  Looking at you going, is this what you want?  Just saying, please.  What?  I just was, I just came home. 
[00:53:00]  And she's just yelling, please help me.  Please help me.  I love that line of yours.  Please help me.  Please help me.  I'm always afraid she's going to go on a therapy.  Like, as soon as she's, like, tries to get herself emotionally healthy, I know I'm finished.  You're done.  All right.  The first thing you have to do is rid yourself of people that are enabling you, the people  that are around you that are hurting you mentally.  Jimmy's gone.  She'll hold my hands and gently tell me, I didn't realize that I liked you because you  reminded me of my abuser.  Let's go to Steve in New York. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, Steve.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  We're having fun today.  What up?  Long time listener.  Love you guys.  All right.  Listen, I own a bar out in Staten Island.  The last thing I'm looking for is a fat pig behind a stick.  And, I mean, go to every strip club in New York.  Where do you see a fat bartender?  Oh, wait.  Let me get you a fat stripper.  Hold on for a minute.  Right.  Give me a break.  Nope.  Too much.  And this is not like an all-out attack on fatties.  I mean, you know, whatever, man.  But it's like, I know what you're saying. 
[00:54:00]  Like, you don't, you should be able, it should be a factor that is allowed to be counted for  certain jobs.  You shouldn't be sued for millions of dollars if you want attractive women in the workplace  when it's appropriate like that, you know, a bar, things like that.  Yeah.  Hooters won the lawsuit not too long ago about the same thing.  Yeah, no one wants to walk in there.  Wait, what was the lawsuit at Hooters?  Hooters.  No, Hooters.  Hooters.  Oh, Hooters.  The same thing.  The, you know, the dress code, you know, having to meet certain requirements. 
[00:54:30]  They beat it.  They beat it because that was the theme of the restaurant.  Remember the dope that wanted to be a Hooters waitress?  Oh, the guy.  There's always that guy.  I want to be a Hooters waitress.  The discrimination.  Right.  Not right, attention whore.  Yeah, really.  Shut up.  Let's keep it real.  Too much.  Hey, if I got some good pictures of the softball game when we had it in Newark, I used to,  as a matter of fact, I delivered all the girls to the game that day.  Of course you did.  All right on, man.  I slid a gun.  I, listen, I got, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:55:00]  Did we say we didn't believe you?  Yeah.  We believe you?  Hey, hey, oh.  Give me one of your, let me get one of your interns and give them the email address to  send it to you.  Awesome.  About 80 good shots.  Steve at foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  You got it.  I'll send them right over.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good one.  Always a pleasure.  Steve might not like the girls, though.  Sometimes he looks at them and he thinks and says very judgmental things, so don't be  upset.  All right.  Barbara Walters' dog talks to her.  Ew.  Of course. 
[00:55:30]  Did we talk about this on the air yet?  I hope the dog says, this stinks.  Could you get more peanut butter?  I just thought they were being honest about her co-host.  No, it's Rosie's show now.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're going to retool the whole show.  It's going to revolve around Rosie.  She's just too good.  She's just too good at being a talk show host.  Well, she was very successful at that when she was doing it. 
[00:56:00]  And now she's doing it with an edge and she's leaving everyone behind on that show.  I love the fact that she's no longer nice, that she's just her, like, the queen of nice.  Yeah, I like who she is now, man.  I really, I told you, one of the things I wish I didn't do is bash her because I like  her now a lot.  Well, do you think she heard it?  No, no, no, no.  Do you think she's sitting there going, Jimmy Norton bashed me?  No.  You self-centered ass.  No, no, I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying it will ever bother me or she's affected by it.  But I just kind of feel like, man, she's saying things that you respect and, like, I trashed  her because she, well, whatever. 
[00:56:30]  You know, you're a bigger person for trashing her and then coming back and saying, you know  something, you know, you should change my opinion.  Okay.  Because I'm the same way.  You know, we beat the crap out of her with a big pumpkin head and the whole thing, riding  the bus with my sister.  That was funny.  Which will never, she'll never be forgiven for.  That was an awful movie.  Awful parody of a retard she played.  Riding the bus with my sister?  Oh, horrid.  But as far as being funny and quick-witted and cut out perfectly for television like that 
[00:57:00]  talk show, she's great.  The only one that could hang with her is Joy.  Joy Behar.  Of course.  Yeah, let's stand up.  But that Elizabeth chick who's really hot, she stinks.  She can't keep up with Rosie.  And Barbara can't either.  She's just too old and out of touch.  And no one cares about Barbara.  Barbara, I think, knows that she's finished.  Like, you're not the relevant one anymore.  These little hens we are talking about the view.  As we're talking, I'll tell you what, but it is a big pop culture story, and because 
[00:57:30]  of Rosie, it has much more of an edge, and it's kind of interesting to at least take a  peek at it.  You see their shoes?  I, uh...  And we all, before we attacked you, had to think, wait, have we?  Were they good or bad?  Jeff Fruits.  Rosie's, uh, Rosie's serving aces right, uh, right, right past that Elizabeth chick.  Yeah.  She is done.  But Barbara Walter's just losing her mind, and I guess she's, uh, she's, uh, saying now 
[00:58:00]  that her dog talks to her.  Do you think she's losing her mind, or is she trying to be outrageous now to get attention?  Like, she's got to be seeing it in, in, in the short period of time that Rosie's been  on that show, that she's kind of now taking a back seat, so she's got to get pressed by  sounding a little insane, or coming off like edgy, or something?  Because she's not funny, and her, her, she's not poignant, she's an irrelevant dummy.  She's not relevant.  She doesn't get it.  It's just, uh, shut up! 
[00:58:30]  She's like an old grandma.  Sit down with your grandma, and try to talk to her about anything in the past 50 years.  Go ahead.  Good luck.  And Rosie is not only, uh, like, a lot funnier, but she's aggressive.  Yeah.  Aggressive lesbian.  Well, yeah.  She's talking about her blog, and emails, and stuff, and then Barbara Walters, to really  show how relevant she is, goes, I don't know anything about the computer.  I don't know about those things.  I could check my email, but that really makes people watch and go, oh boy, she's gonna tell 
[00:59:00]  me something I never knew.  But you know how to read, and one of your assistants gave you what, uh, was on the blog.  Who are you kidding?  Well, in the, uh, the past couple of months, she's, uh, done some crazy things.  She took, she talked about taking, uh, one of those prescription pills.  What, what, what prescription pill?  I had my soup, and I woke up at about 5.30, 6 o'clock in my bed.  Oxycontin?  What, what's she taking?  I don't know.  She wanted to reveal what, uh, prescription pill.  And then this horrific thing she talked about, uh, recently, uh, she revealed that she had 
[00:59:30]  an X-rated dream about Brad Pitt.  That's like, you hack.  Outrageous?  Yeah.  She's a hack, and she's lying.  It wasn't Brad Pitt.  It was probably some black gentleman wearing sweatpants and no underwear she saw in the  convenience store.  She dropped, her mouth was being snaked like a toilet.  Let's go to, uh, stupid.  Let's go to, uh, hack. 
[01:00:00]  Pick someone from your time, at least.  The fatty Arbuckle.  I had a dream about Brad Pitt, did ya?  Go with Gary Cooper.  What did you dream?  Gary Cooper.  He was changing your diapers, and he suddenly found you attractive?  You old Lucky Louie calling racist bag of meat?  He was changing her diaper and adopted what was in it.  Him and that wife of his.  Wow, we are vicious today. 
[01:00:30]  Ah, screw them.  Barbara stinks.  I really hope that she dies in a fire looking out a little window so we can all watch her  dumb face.  By the end of this show, all the women we gained in the last two years are gone.  They're gonna go check out Whoopi.  We only want the cover.  Wake up with Whoopi!  Uh, Rocket, what's up?  Uh-oh.  Best line ever on the show was when Jimmy was talking about the retard movie and that  her dumps were filled with gum and pennies.  Oh, no. 
[01:01:00]  What's the matter?  I took a lot of that oxy powder last night.  Oh, no.  I'm okay.  No, no, you'll be, I won't be okay.  If you're, okay.  Uh, Iraq, I need an air freshener.  Stat.  I tried, uh, that stuff one time.  Never again.  I don't know what the hell that does.  Oh, my God.  There's gotta be anything.  I think, I think it expands everything inside you, so everything just has to fall out.  It just falls out.  You fill up with water or whatever.  All right, listen.  So, let's get to the, uh, the latest Barbara Walters thing. 
[01:01:30]  Is it really bad?  No.  But I'm laughing because I feel, like, more burglary.  You're, you're gurgling?  You're percolating?  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  It sounds like a whoopee.  Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Uh, yeah, you guys go ahead.  It's your show.  Go ahead.  Nothing.  I gotta show you.  Fuck, I missed Days of Our Lives yesterday.  Can you guys catch me up?  All right. 
[01:02:00]  We'll talk about Days of Our Lives next.  That's funny.  Bo and Hope.  That is funny.  You should have just gone with that.  Bo and Hope.  Oh.  Did you ever like them?  Let's go.  Barbara Walters, dog talks to her on The View.  We got the audio.  Here it is.  You all know that I'm a very sensible person.  Yes.  You have known me for many years.  I do not exaggerate.  I try not to lie.  Exactly.  All right.  I have this little dog, Cha-Cha.  Joy is about to throw up.  Cha-Cha, I've always said, is the world's most perfect dog, but I'm kind of kidding.  I know.  You should not.  Do we have the...  Well, okay.  You all have dogs. 
[01:02:30]  Do we have Cha-Cha's latest picture, please?  Can we put Cha-Cha...  His head shot.  Yeah.  There he is.  Oh, there she is.  Oh.  No, I tell you, this is true.  I'm not kidding.  She's about to say it.  Get a close-up, Mark, because this is going to be good.  Go ahead.  Say it, Barbara.  Just like you do in the green room.  Say it.  Okay.  Well, I was going out the other night, and I was standing at the elevator with my darling  woman who has been running my home and my life for 32 years, Agandelle Thomas.  Oh, wife partner?  So we're standing there, and Cha-Cha had a little dog face, you know, that when you go 
[01:03:00]  out, you have dogs, you know, sometimes they sort of look at you.  So I said to...  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  I love you, Cha-Cha.  I love you, Cha-Cha.  And Cha-Cha said to me, I love you.  The dog said, I love you, to Barbara Walters.  And then the dog said...  Barbara Walters used to talk to Fidel Castro. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  One of the only people in America that had that honor.  Then the dog said, what are you doing that's not lipstick?  Put her out to pasture.  What is wrong with her?  You hear Rosie trying to hustle her along?  Say it, Barbara.  Yeah, just say it, Barbara, you doddering old bitch.  Barbara was talking because she's such a witless dope.  She just knew she had a moment, so she was trying to lead up a bit longer.  Yeah.  And Rosie was just trying to get to the point.  So she could have a moment. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Get to it, stupid.  She's doing everything possible to get the attention back on her.  Talking dog.  First of all, the old dog saying I love you gag.  I've seen, I don't know how many, Ripley's Believe It or Not, America's Funniest Home Videos.  All those shows back then, America's Funniest People.  You can pick any one of those shows.  You'll get a person, the stupid pet tricks that'll come out and say my dog talks.  And it'll go, what the hell is that? 
[01:04:30]  It's barking, you dumb bitch.  I hope the next time Cha-Cha says I love you, it's a sound she thinks is I love you as she's  walking it and a truck has run over Cha-Cha's head and its brains and intestines are shot from  the back all over her white shoes while she stands there.  I hope she's looking down at Cha-Cha and she's holding on to the legion and its head is crushed.  Okay, here's my little bit of irony that I want to happen with Cha-Cha, the dog that 
[01:05:00]  says I love you.  I want Barbara to fall and break her graham cracker hip in her house, in her apartment,  and no one comes to see her for a while because perhaps maybe she's on vacation or something.  And the dog she said, said I love you, Cha-Cha, starts eating her, actually eating her alive  because she cannot feed Cha-Cha.  And Cha-Cha, through love, of course, starts eating Barbara Walters, face first. 
[01:05:30]  And then I hope that she was watching HBO when she fell and Lucky Louie marathons are on  and she's paralyzed and can't get up so she has to watch all 12 episodes while Cha-Cha runs  into the room and lifts one leg right over her face every 20 minutes.  Walks off with another limb.  Yeah.  As he laughs, running back to watch the rest of the episode.  Where are you?  Where are you?  Well, you hear about the dogs that eat their old owners.  That end up dying.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  And the old people, they die and their family cares so much about them they don't notice for  a month and the dog has eaten them.  Cha-Cha, get out of there.  Your breath is going to smell like pennies.  Can we go old school?  The story is probably about a year ago.  It happened in Huntington Station.  Yeah.  Where the lady was just eaten away by her little poodle.  Her little poodle.  She dropped dead in the kitchen.  And I guess the family really didn't keep tabs on her for a while.  Can we try to find that story?  It might be tough.  And when someone finally, you know, bust through the door. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  They found her on the kitchen floor.  A nice healthy dog was in there with her.  Lots of pieces of the lady missing.  And just bits and pieces of her.  The lady took care of that dog for many, many years.  Just a big kibble.  There's the big thank you.  Well, the girls give her a ribbing.  Whatever you say, Barbara.  If I were doing this alone, but I can tell her on vacation, I am bringing her in next week to verify this.  Yeah.  Because she heard it. 
[01:07:00]  She heard it.  I didn't make this up.  No.  And any of you.  No, Barbara, I believe you.  You believe me.  You've been with me for years.  Crazy.  No.  You know, you have to understand from me the thrill.  No, you told me backstage that you didn't think it was crazy.  Now you've left me.  No.  I'm with you still.  I'm with you.  I think it's a substitute for a child, which I think is, you know, disturbing.  But it's a little crazy to think the dog is talking.  Maybe you have a hearing issue.  Maybe you wanted to talk about that.  They're called Bastian and dogs have talked. 
[01:07:30]  Please, if you can possibly record it, send it in to us.  And next week will be the special Talking Dogs of Barbara Walters Presents.  You know, that'll be good.  We're going to get into that.  Maybe Tracker can do Hot Topics maybe next week.  No, the dog has to learn to say 2020.  There you go.  That's all Elizabeth had to say was Hot Topics.  Say we can make it part of Hot Topics.  Hot Topics. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  You have nothing.  It sucks.  You dope.  I love how they just bashed her.  Kind of mullet broad.  Kind of mullet.  You know who's in a writer and go, I agree?  David Berkowitz.  You and David Berkowitz, stupid.  Let's go to Dirty.  Dirty, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And you said when he changed the diaper, he adopted what was inside it.  You can't let that go.  I don't think we did.  No, everyone heard it.  I think we all got a hearty chuckle.  It was a great laugh.  Everyone heard it, and it will be the line of the day.  Thank you, sir.  I think we got a hearty chuckle. 
[01:08:30]  We certainly did.  We got to bring back today.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  We dropped that because of the weird day we have now where we do two different shows and stuff.  And maybe we start a new feature line of the day as well.  No one's beating that, Anthony.  We could go home now.  All right.  Good night.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  There are many ways to get an Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  This is not one of them.  Hello.  I am selling Wow stickers on Craigslist.  Please buy a $4,000 American through a numbered account in Zurich, and I'll happily send you a Wow sticker. 
[01:09:00]  Shiny and new.  I have a friend in the shipping industry, so shipping won't be a problem.  Get your own Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  Go to opieandanthony.com and fill out the online form.  We'll send you a shiny new Wow sticker, and you'll be enjoying some lovely melons in no time.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're very excited today.  Sounds it right.  We're very excited today. 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  We got The Rock calling in at 8 o'clock.  Stuart Copeland is in our green room.  We'll talk to him in a few minutes here.  Of course, a police fame.  His guy, too.  It's amazing.  His guy came in.  The guy I repped in him came in and just said hello to us.  And he's just, like, perfect, this guy who works with him.  And he's like, you just want to help him.  He comes in.  He's all happy.  Hey, how are you?  And I'm thinking, that's the way you want a guy representing you.  Very up, happy guy.  Yes.  He comes in.  He's polite and fun.  He shakes hands. 
[01:10:00]  He has a big smile.  And I'm thinking, maybe that's my problem.  When I go from town to town, I don't have that happy, smiling man who makes people feel warm.  No.  I have Mr. Norton regrets to inform you that he won't be doing any press unless the feather pillows are in the hotel.  We love Club Soda Kenny.  We certainly do love Club Soda Kenny, but no one else does.  Yeah, that's the problem.  We love Kenny, and Kenny loves us.  Hey, Cleveland, are you awake or what? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, you, Cleveland.  You getting your tickets for the O&A traveling virus?  Yep.  23rd of September.  That's the last one until next summer.  Patrice O'Neal, me, Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, Rich Voss, Otto, and George.  And we've got to add one more.  I've got them all.  And I think we're going to get really silly because it's the last one of the tour.  So we're hoping a lot of people do the road trip thing.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  We're going to take over Cleveland, hopefully like we took over Philly. 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  So make sure you get your tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is on OpieAndAnthony.com.  And if you want to get a feel for the O&A traveling virus,  there are plenty of videos from the O&A traveling virus on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search, okay?  What else is going on today?  Yeah, Britney Spears gave birth to another son, right?  I didn't even hear it.  Didn't she just announce she was pregnant?  Was she pregnant for what, like six, seven months?  Yeah, that went really quick.  Did she go early to try to save that body of hers? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, I never thought of that.  Oh, women are doing that.  Is that what the celebrities are doing?  Women are doing that these days.  They take them out at like six months, put them in a little incubator.  They're scheduling when they want to have their kids.  They want to stretch certain things out on their body.  Is that it?  Well, supposedly the last month is what does all the damage.  So a lot of these women are like scheduling when they're going to give birth.  Last month is what bangs them up?  Really?  The last month is when they...  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah.  When you really start blowing up the balloon. 
[01:12:00]  And their head grows too big and really starts damaging things.  Yeah.  So...  Well, you hear an echo for the next 20 years of your marriage.  You're working up a sweat and she feels nothing.  Good for you, Britney.  Whatever.  I, uh, yeah.  I like K-Fed though, man.  I want to get him in here.  You don't and you don't.  My husband's a good rapper.  I'm sorry.  You don't and you don't.  Are you starting to think he is?  K-Fed is great.  How do you not...  I love everything that is K-Fed.  You're a lying...  Now we know who we're lying.  You're a lying satchel of waste product. 
[01:12:30]  I love his rhymes.  I love his...  The guy's got the look.  The attitude.  You had us, but then you went too far with it.  I love K-Fed.  He never had me.  No one's buying it now.  K-Fed rules.  You didn't have me for a second.  All right.  Sing one song from K-Fed.  Go ahead.  Pop-a-zow.  All right.  That one everyone knows.  I don't even know that.  Everyone knows that.  Even my dead grandma knows that one.  I don't know that.  Give us another one.  The new one he did with Britney.  I'm not going to blow it up with K-Fed.  Let him do it.  I can't do justice by...  Yeah, but if you love him so much, you give him publicity.  We're talking to well over a million people right now.  I wouldn't sing Sabbath songs either because I can't... 
[01:13:00]  No, you're a liar.  He needs the publicity, so why don't you...  No, I'm not.  Just as once, we give you permission to sing another K-Fed song.  Go ahead.  A little Jimmy Norton.  Ow, I got the moves.  Ow.  That's pretty good.  By the way, yes, she had a scheduled C-section, so...  Ooh.  She scheduled the birth of her kid.  Oh, no, she...  And then we got this cute story that just proves that we humans just stink. 
[01:13:30]  Again?  I look forward to the day when the insects take over, and it's their turn.  Fans of crocodile hunter Steve Irwin may be taking revenge on stingrays in Australia.  Someone killed at least 10 stingrays on the coast where Irwin died in a freak accident last week  while filming a documentary.  A stingray stuck the poisonous barb into Irwin's heart.  Marine officials say some of the stingrays had their tails cut off.  They're killing stingrays. 
[01:14:00]  They actually got a message.  It was, uh, they opened up, and they found one of the stingrays' vests with a little barber in it.  Stupid people.  Said the stingray sleeps with the people.  How awful is that?  I don't know if I love it or hate it.  You really think it's all right for...  No, it's awful.  It's just the fact that there's dummy fans that would do that.  I know.  It kind of makes me happy that you think you're this great environmentalist, and all your fans are animal killers.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's a good angle there.  That's a little bit of irony, and I don't think it matters. 
[01:14:30]  10?  Boy, that'll put a dent in the population.  I've seen those things, like, in...  What do they travel in?  Flocks?  Schools?  Uh, pods.  Pods.  Pods?  Is it a pod?  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  And who cares?  Your brother's a marine biologist.  You should know just by osmosis.  Stingrays travel in...  It's actually school.  I would say in threesomes.  Is it?  Yep.  Always three.  Flying. 
[01:15:00]  Always three.  You can never tell on this show how full of crap any one of us are at any given moment.  Next time, take a look for yourself.  Always three.  Always three?  Always three.  Mm-hmm.  In, like, kind of a diamond formation.  Formation?  Yeah.  Flying formation.  Yeah, a little diamond formation.  All right.  Formation.  I'll look for that.  In threes.  Threes.  So...  Those were the stealth fighters you saw.  The lead and the two wingmen.  Why don't they, like, go out and kill, like, pedophiles or something instead of this thing?  Well, the pedophiles stuck him in the heart. 
[01:15:30]  Maybe they would have.  Yeah.  These are hardcore people.  Yeah.  All right.  Before we get Stuart Copeland in here, we got to talk about the front page of the New York  Post.  We're going to get serious for a minute here.  We do that from time to time.  Well, this is not even serious because it's ridiculous on its own merit.  We were talking about it yesterday.  I started the show off with a little tirade, a little tirade about how it's very difficult  to win a war because the president gave a speech on the war on terror, and it's very 
[01:16:00]  difficult to win a war when you don't just go full bore.  Just take all your resources short of the A-bomb, and even that is a consideration, and just  really wreak havoc on the people that need to be destroyed.  Now, I'm a dummy when it comes to these things.  Yeah.  When did they start making rules of war?  Rules of war.  When did that all start?  Forever.  Ever since there was war, I believe there have been certain rules, etiquette, things based 
[01:16:30]  on old-fashioned honor and chivalry with the knights.  But does the enemy follow the same rules?  No.  Ted Offensive.  Ted Offensive.  There you go.  That really helped Vietnam.  The Vietnamese.  Right.  The Vietnamese launched an attack, coordinated attack, during a holiday that we said they  would never do that.  They did it, and it showed that they could still coordinate after we'd been saying for  years, hey, we're totally busting them apart. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Good example there, Jimmy.  And then, well, we have rules, and the front page of the paper shows 190 Taliban terrorists  in Afghanistan.  They're at a funeral.  They're all gathered together as a high-flying drone is taking their picture.  Can I interrupt?  Sure.  Because everyone's beating me up.  Doesn't a diamond have four points, not three?  What?  Well, you've got to use your imagination for the fourth point. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Depends on how it's cut.  They call me a dope.  They're like, wouldn't it be a triangle?  Yeah, I guess you're right.  But I like to use my imagination.  So, to me, it's a diamond.  I just imagine that fourth point.  It's your world.  You paint it however you want, Opie.  You asses.  Put a little three-pointed diamond right about here.  Sorry, Anis.  It's your world.  This show does have ADD.  You were on to something good, too.  Sorry.  Well, 190 Taliban terrorists here for a funeral.  And there's a Predator drone flying above. 
[01:18:00]  Got him targeted.  It's a beautiful shot.  But there's an American rule of engagement that bars any attacks on cemeteries.  American bombers or Predator drones or aircraft cannot attack people, regardless of a group  of terrorists here, in a cemetery.  We are a dumb nation.  We are a nation of idiots. 
[01:18:30]  This is what I was talking about.  You can't have these kind of rules and think you're going to win a war because war must be kept horrible.  It must be kept as something that no one wants because it is so awful.  We put so many rules on it that we try to keep it nice and cordial, and it just extends it.  It keeps it going.  You blow these people.  If this is the enemy and you see them and they're in a cemetery, you blow them up. 
[01:19:00]  What are they afraid of?  Collateral damage in a cemetery?  It's the best place to do it.  It cuts down on transportation costs.  Right.  You bomb them.  They're buried.  God bless.  Yeah.  Allah bless.  So this picture on the front page of the New York Post?  Yeah.  The guy wasn't able to take this shot?  Couldn't take the shot.  Are you kidding me?  They were creaming.  The military saw this.  190 Taliban terrorists.  They were running through the Pentagon when these pictures came in going, oh my God, take the shot. 
[01:19:30]  And one of the higher ups said, nope, can't do it.  Can't do it.  Rules of engagement.  No cemeteries.  That nonsense started, I think, mostly in Vietnam where they were so obsessed.  I mean, it might have been that way in Korea.  But they were so obsessed with pleasing people, a bunch of scumbag politicians worried about losing a certain aspect of the population's vote that they decided to fight in a certain way.  It's just revolting.  This is where politics comes into war and that really has no place in there. 
[01:20:00]  And Bush is as big a dummy as the rest of them.  You're as conservative as you can get and you don't have the ball to just go do it.  Just win and smash everybody.  He just was talking the other day about how either they're going to win or we're going to win.  The terrorists are going to win or we're going to win.  And the future is going to play out in this way.  We must be vigilant.  We must blah, blah, blah, blah.  Stay the course.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Now, I have some balls.  This is what it's about. 
[01:20:30]  These guys are the enemy.  You've got to dispatch them or pull out and surrender.  One or the other.  You know, whatever you want to do.  Just leave the situation.  Say, okay, you know, whatever you guys want to do, we're leaving.  Take over, whatever.  Or fight a war like you're supposed to in all of its glorious horror and bloodshed  and innocent death and destruction because that's the only way wars end.  All right.  Let's go to Wayne in D.C. 
[01:21:00]  Wayne.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah.  What happened to targeting innocent bystanders and people heading to work in New York City?  Well, yeah, that's the other side who apparently has no rules.  Right.  See, we play by rules.  They have no rules.  That is the weirdest thing to me.  If they're not playing by the rules, why do we have to?  They could grab people and televise chopping their heads off, sawing their heads off as  they're just screaming.  Most awful, horrible thing you could ever see.  But we have rules that we have to adhere to or else we're bad guys. 
[01:21:30]  I'll tell you why.  Because they're more honest than we are.  Yeah.  There you go.  They are what you see.  It's horror.  It's terror.  That's what's frightening us.  That scares the bejesus out of people.  That makes people that are civilian workers over there not go over there.  It worked.  No one wants to go over there.  You don't want to be that guy.  Could you imagine being that guy with that flag behind you and five masked men and you're 
[01:22:00]  tied hands behind your back and they tell you to read this and you're sitting there  going, oh my God, how did I get myself in this situation?  Oh boy, we know how this ends.  That's horror.  That's terror.  That is the way you fight a war.  If we're not going to fight it that way, then don't fight it.  Let's go down to Virginia.  Ernie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  What's going on, little Jimmy?  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Hey, I've got a very interesting rule of war that the United States tries to go by. 
[01:22:30]  Anyway, you're not allowed to shoot people with a .50 caliber machine gun.  Yeah, that's another one.  What?  It's overkill.  Yeah, but you are allowed to destroy enemy equipment, including their uniform.  They got around that rule?  Yeah, they got around that one.  And you know the galling guns that they have on the helicopters, the attack helicopters and  everything?  Yeah.  I'm in the military, so I've actually seen footage of guys being shredded to pieces from 
[01:23:00]  those helicopters with the galling guns.  Yeah, I saw that.  That's online.  You could download that one.  That's fun.  And it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it is actually a rule that we have to go  by.  Too many rules.  Thank you, sir.  I mean, there are rules like the Geneva Convention rules, which were put in place years ago,  and that's just basic, like, I don't know, humanity, I guess.  You treat prisoners with a little bit of dignity, whatever. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  Keep civilian casualties to a minimum.  But World War II, they were carpet bombing cities.  And, you know, it made people want the war to end.  When you do this, we've been five years now, you know, pretty much after we got bombed here.  That's pretty much when I consider the war starting.  And shortly after, we went into Afghanistan and then Iraq. 
[01:24:00]  And we've been there.  This has gone on longer than World War II.  It's ridiculous.  Rob from Salem, Virginia.  We were told to aim our 50 cows at the enemy's canteens.  That's their equipment.  Let's say hi to Lee, all the way up there in Maine.  Lee, what's up?  Lee, let's go.  All right, we lost him.  All right, one more here.  Let's go to New Jersey.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, Vinny.  Vinny.  Hey, it's Dave. 
[01:24:30]  Ah, Dave whatever from Jersey.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  You there?  Yes, we're here, stupid.  What?  Oh, my God.  You said have a good one.  Can't you start?  Oh, you said you have a good one.  First, you get your name wrong because Travis was polishing his fingernails and he couldn't  type it in properly.  Yeah.  It's not a problem, guys.  It's not a manicure if it's coral colored.  Stupid.  Hey, I'm just a former Marine. 
[01:25:00]  I'm going to give you a little bit of insight on what we were explained over there.  They're wrong.  The reason for not bombing those targets is counter politics.  The reason that we were getting accused so many times of actually breaking those rules  that now we have to actually publicly announce that we are not breaking the rules and people  can finally see how stupid these actual rules and engagements are.  How about we come out and publicly say we're not following rules anymore?  Yeah, we're doing what we have to do to win.  How about we bring all the horror of war to a war, which includes civilian deaths, huge 
[01:25:30]  amounts of destruction of property, things like that.  Things that make people turn around and go, look, we got to talk.  We got to talk about this.  The only thing that even brought the Vietnamese to the table, to the bargaining table, was  the carpet bombing of North Vietnam.  That's the only reason.  People can't handle mass destruction.  No.  They can't handle killing.  It doesn't matter how.  Right.  It doesn't matter how much. 
[01:26:00]  You know, you say, oh, these are animals.  They don't have.  It's not an army.  It's we don't know who we're fighting.  We don't know who the enemy is.  It's different factions of this, that or the other thing.  Doesn't matter.  You unleash enough death and destruction on these people, their families, their property.  Someone will step up as a representative and and say, look, we at least got to have a  chat about this because we got nothing left.  Let's go to a Starbucks and talk to us over.  Yeah, you've completely bombed everything.  We did. 
[01:26:30]  Can we chat?  Have a talk.  Political correctness has killed the way that we fight war.  It has.  It's hindered our ability to perform our job over there so much that it's it's coming  down to where we have to make these.  It puts our men and women in a lot more danger, a lot more danger.  We have the best equipment in the world to fight wars with and we can't use them.  We can't we can't use them in certain situations.  And all it does is prolong it.  I'm not talking about this being cruel.  I'm just talking about to end it as quickly as possible. 
[01:27:00]  The way we're fighting this is just making it longer.  We actually have instances in the history where we are embassies have been being attacked.  We had to call on the phone to actually return fire to get permission to return fire under fire.  Isn't that great?  That's a political correctness thing.  Give a phone call to return fire.  Excuse me.  I'm halfway around the world at an embassy.  I'm being shot at protocol.  Can you get to that?  Keep her by because of this.  And then they wonder why our numbers of deaths of our comrades are so high is because we have to stop for stupid politics. 
[01:27:30]  And why years later this still goes on because, you know, you take out one guy.  We get all psyched.  It's like, oh, my God, we took out Al Zarqawi.  This is great.  You know, and then they just put another guy in his place.  It's not the one at a time guys.  You can't do that.  It's not that kind of war.  They've had it right by attacking our embassies, attacking our ships, attacking our buildings.  Mass numbers are, you know, what gets the war.  You can, every time you kill a high up, somebody else will be there to take their place. 
[01:28:00]  If you have about 80 grunts, you're going to win that war a whole lot quicker.  They realize that.  We don't.  One thing with the problem, I think, with, like, especially Vietnam, and definitely this, is that the people who are fighting are so mixed in with the people that were not fighting.  I think it's rare that you go to war where you have both groups.  You're right.  Like, when you're in World War II, you're fighting the Japanese.  That was it.  You're fighting the Japanese.  It was all of them.  It was the country.  So it was easy to bomb your enemy.  But here it's like you really will be bombing half the people you kill are people that are actually on your side. 
[01:28:30]  Do you know how many civilians we killed in Japan?  Ten.  Those were incendiary bombs just dropped on.  Everyone, you know, Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Before those, we dropped incendiary bombs all over Japan and just cooked millions of civilians.  We left shadows.  It was, you know, and then, you know, you bring in a few A-bombs, a couple A-bombs.  And we left shadows of people.  But that, how long after that did someone decide to go, uh, check, please? 
[01:29:00]  It was days.  It wasn't our fault they used wood to build everything.  Oh, my God.  How about some cement?  Rice paper and wood.  How about some cement?  Maybe a little metal.  Could have done it with a few firecrackers.  Oh, my God.  Uh, let's say hi to Lisa in New Jersey.  Speed round here, because we've got to move on.  We've got Stuart Copeland waiting in the green room.  Uh, Lisa, go.  Hi.  I just, I've been listening on my way to work, and I'm certainly not a pro-war person, but  I've got to say that I do agree with you, because I, you know, if you see what happened  in Israel and Lebanon, Israel went in and just assaulted those people, like, relentlessly. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And it made people take it seriously and say, we've got to do something, and we've got to  do it fast, because they're not going to stop.  Do you think if they didn't go in there just full blast, that they would have gone to a  ceasefire and gone to the peace table, and at least, you know, because now they're talking,  and there's no more fighting going on?  Right, right.  Yeah, but the difference, the difference is, we, we, our Saddam Hussein is in charge.  You remove him, and he did brutalize the people.  I mean, the majority of Iraqis, I'm sure, didn't deserve to be brutalized like that. 
[01:30:00]  So it's kind of hard to justify after you, like, get rid of him for this oppressive regime  just to go in and bomb the whole country.  It's just a very hard thing to balance with something like this.  It is, and it sounds cruel.  Oh, why don't you just...  Yeah, you would talk.  Go ahead, Stuart.  I was addressing you, not Anthony, who I see every day.  Yeah, I got rid of it.  Go ahead.  It's one of those situations, though, Jim, where I see your point.  You know, Vietnam, the same thing.  They were with the people, and you never knew who was who, the enemy.  But that isn't our problem. 
[01:30:30]  It really isn't.  Sorry you're mixed in with the indigenous people of that country.  That means it's going to be even worse.  There's going to be a lot of civilians getting killed, and that's what brings people to the table.  That's why war is awful.  It's a horrible thing because civilians wind up getting killed.  If you try to just pinpoint with smart bombs where one guy or a meeting of higher-ups are going to be, it's going to drag on and on and on. 
[01:31:00]  If you can't tell the people that live there from the enemy, you must bomb them all.  And that's what they're doing.  They're killing our civilians, you know.  That brings them to the table.  That makes them say, all right, look, we got to make a deal.  It's the only way to do that.  It's horrible.  But it's war.  That's what war is.  How can you not make war horrible?  No, no.  I just don't know if that brings them to the table or not.  It does.  I don't think they can.  It's proven through history it does. 
[01:31:30]  I think it causes a bigger havoc.  How many times in history, though, is the enemy you're bombing actually sabotaging things in its own country that you're trying to fix?  It's a really weird one here, man.  It's not like, again, it's not like World War II where we knew we were fighting.  It's just a very weird situation.  The people would not blame them, would blame us.  If we killed all these civilians, they're not going to go surrender.  They're going to join even harder with the people that are resisting.  I don't know.  It's called just blasting them into submission until they get so upset. 
[01:32:00]  Like I brought up, if our civilians in every city were being blown up once a week, just huge amounts, thousands of people were being killed.  In Chicago, in Philly, in Boston, San Francisco, West Palm, New York City, New London, Connecticut, Portland, Maine, Rochester, these places are just Buffalo, Providence, they're all just blowing up.  Dallas. 
[01:32:30]  If it happened once a week.  Pittsburgh.  At the end of this month, 28th or 30th at the improv.  He's blowing up.  If that happened every week, just thousands of people in every one of these cities dying, you wouldn't say, damn you, to the planes flying over, shaking your fist.  You'd go to your government and go, could you please do something to make this stop?  You would lose your mind to the people in charge of you that are supposed to be protecting you. 
[01:33:00]  So it's the same thing.  You go over there and make it so horrible for those people that they have to rise up and say, just stop this.  Someone talk this out.  They tried that in Israel.  So what do they do?  They elected Hamas.  The ones who were.  And they went in and started blowing the crap out of them.  And and people come to the bargaining table.  No, no, no.  But I'm saying is they the Hamas was elected and they were the terrorists.  Like, it didn't drive people to say, stop the terrorists. 
[01:33:30]  It made them elect them.  Yeah, that's Israel, though.  Let me tell you something.  They're screwed no matter what they do over there.  Yeah, we have to take a break.  We're so late.  Get rolling in here for a second, please.  Yeah.  People are commenting.  Didn't we used to say all is fair?  All's fair in love and war.  Nice.  Throw a cliche.  Yeah, there you go.  Easy cliche.  There you go.  That'll solve everything.  Yeah.  What are you doing, Kenny?  He's getting rolling.  He's on the phone with The Rock.  Yeah.  We're going to talk to The Rock. 
[01:34:00]  I need Roland on the radio show.  The radio show is more important than him telling The Rock that we're going to be a little late.  Roland, help me out here, man.  Well, why is The Rock calling?  What's The Rock got?  To promote his new film.  What's the film?  I believe it's...  No, just one quick, quick, quick.  What is it?  Roland.  Roland.  Gridiron Gang.  What?  Gridiron Gang.  Gridiron Gang.  What?  What?  Gridiron Gang.  What is it?  Gridiron Gang.  Gridiron Gang? 
[01:34:30]  Gridiron Gang.  Gridiron Gang.  Wait, The Rock is promoting what?  Gridiron Gang.  It's out Friday-wide.  He's promoting Gridiron Gang.  Gang.  Gang?  Gang?  What's the name of the thing he's promoting?  Is it gay football?  I'm going to give you a quick plug.  Gridiron Gang.  Arn.  Wait, wait.  Arn.  Gridiron.  Who are you, sissy spacey?  All right, wait.  Try it again, because now I think I got it.  Gridiron Gang?  Gridiron Gang?  Gang.  Gang? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, gang.  What is that name?  What is it?  Like a posse.  All right, say it.  So, The Rock is promoting Gridiron Gang?  Gridiron Gang?  Gridiron Gang.  He's ironing?  Yeah.  It's a football movie?  It's about him and the exhibit rehabilitating guys in prison, and they play football.  And we have, obviously, a legend here, Stuart Copeland, a rock legend, promoting what?  He's promoting the DVD of The Police.  The Police?  The Police.  The Police.  What's it called?  He's in a band called The Police.  Huh? 
[01:35:30]  Arn.  Synchronicity?  That's the name of his DVD?  I believe so.  Could Arn Gein?  You know something?  I said something about six months ago, I guess it was.  Yeah.  Maybe Tham will remember, because I said it in the office.  Yeah.  I go, that Roland, he's a nice enough guy, but I can never understand a goddamn word he says.  Excuse me.  And now we all see it.  Excuse me.  What was the name of the thing he's promoting?  It was through XM.  I believe it was Synchronicity.  Secret-nessy?  Secret-nessy.  Wait, what?  Wasn't that one of The Police's most famous albums? 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  So that's also the name of his behind-the-scenes DVD?  I'm not sure.  And it's called what again?  It was XM.  I don't know.  Oh.  This is a...  No, I have it in front of me.  I'm just enjoying this.  Well, I can book it for this.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I believe everyone stares the police inside out.  Right.  Close.  I love The Police, though.  What do you like about The Police?  The music.  Favorite song?  Landlord.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting. 
[01:36:30]  How are you going to go to that?  They're having an in-store tonight, which we'll promote at Virgin Records here on Broadway.  Virgin, Union Square, in-store.  Oh, Union Square.  What a dope I am.  All right.  Virgin in Union Square and in-store with Stuart Copeland, who played what for The Police?  The drums.  That's right.  And their biggest album?  Synchronicity.  All right.  That's any answer he has for The Police.  It's just going to be synchronicity.  And what's The Rock promoting?  I think it was the best of, actually.  And what's The Rock promoting again?  Grid Iron Gang.  Grid Iron Gang. 
[01:37:00]  Grid Iron Gang.  Grid Iron Gang.  Grid Iron Gang.  I call in Friday because...  What?  I think he's calling in Friday now because he was packed to schedule.  Who?  The Rock.  Oh, we lost The Rock?  The Rock says...  But he really wanted to talk to you guys, so he'll call in Friday.  Grid Iron Gang?  To have more time with you, guys.  I'm promoting Grid Iron Gang.  And Stuart is doing his signing at what place?  Synchronicity.  The version of the next version. 
[01:37:30]  Secret.  Synthesis.  Secret.  Whatever you said.  Secret Nancy.  And what's the DVD about?  No one gave me one, so I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  So Stuart Copeland is here.  He's got a DVD, but you don't know what it's about?  Well, it was XM Things.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who'd call me?  I don't know.  So it's...  But I do love the police.  I'll see you tonight.  Oh, my God.  But what?  All right. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, God damn.  I love this guy.  That's what Roland...  The best description of you is just gentle confusion.  Totally is.  He's so...  I don't know whether I, like, want to hug him or just punch him until he dies.  Oh.  All right.  So it's...  What's EVD?  About something.  Probably behind the scenes that Jimmy was saying of the police.  What tipped you off when I said it's the police behind the scenes?  All right. 
[01:38:30]  Roland, you're off the hook.  So, all right.  He's like the kid that would go in the tent with a questionable scout leader.  Okay, what am I doing?  What?  You need me?  Yeah, he'd be awful in court.  What did he do?  With the bathing suit covers?  There was touching of some sort.  There's...  I don't know.  Gridiron...  Gridiron...  Gridiron gain.  Gain?  Gridiron...  Gridiron gain.  All right.  Gridiron gain.  We have to take a break. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, we got to take a little break.  You're a Copeland next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Want to get wowed?  Yeah!

We play the police. 
[01:40:00]  Because we've got Stuart Copeland in studio, sitting on our couch.  How cool is this?  Right on our couch.  Our nice red couch.  This is a great couch, by the way, guys.  You know, most of those other radio stations, you go in there, they give you, like, a chair.  Yeah.  On this big, red, leatherette couch.  On a couch.  And I don't believe anything's been done on it.  Can't confirm it.  Would you like me to do something?  Well, I wasn't going in that direction.  I was saying, for your safety.  I don't think so.  Thank you.  It is a clean couch.  Yes. 
[01:40:30]  Squeaky clean.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  Not so bad.  Not so squeaky.  Not so clean.  But fine.  Can I ask the question that you've probably been asked a million times?  A little known fact, I was a huge police fan growing up.  Oh, sure.  Huge.  Grew up with the police.  Why won't you guys get back together?  Well, nobody's offered us enough money.  Yeah, right.  I don't know, as a matter of fact.  I'd be ready.  You know, I got a different job now.  I'm a film composer.  Right.  And so it's not a career move for me, a step forward or a step sideways or anything. 
[01:41:00]  So it's not about the money?  It's a no-brainer for me.  I'll do it.  I'll do a free show.  You know, playing with those two guys is something that is real exciting.  I thought by now that you guys would have figured something out.  You know, I'm not pushing it.  And here's why.  I got eight years and five albums out of that guy.  And our account is closed.  If he doesn't want to do it, I'm not going to hassle him.  It's been almost, what, like 20 years?  Yeah, yeah.  You guys have pushed it 20 years since you broke up, right? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I mean, there's nothing that says we've got to do it.  I'd be very keen.  I'd love to do it.  But there's nothing that says we've got to do it.  And when Stingo is in the mood, he's got my number.  Right.  I'll be there like a shot.  No problem.  No problem at all.  I think we're ready for it.  I think, well, it sounds like it doesn't matter, you guys, as far as the money.  And you would sell out to everywhere.  No, for me, the one stipulation I would make is that it's got to be a free concert, you know?  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, we don't, it's just like, that's not the reason for doing it. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  It's all about playing with those two guys for me and playing music that I really like.  And that folks out there are really like, and there's a gazillion, I'm playing a show  of that dimension is very exciting.  You don't need to get paid for that stuff.  Didn't you guys play at a wedding or something for one of you guys?  Yeah, we got paid for that.  No, no.  We played at Sting's Wedding.  Sting's Wedding.  Yeah.  He served a lot of excellent, excellent, excellent champagne.  And we got up and blasted through Roxanne, a message in a bottle, a couple other ones 
[01:42:30]  that I don't remember.  Yeah.  But that's how they got together.  It was at Sting's Wedding and also like, hey, what the hell?  We're all drunk.  Let's do it.  Well, all the crew and everybody's like, come on.  Actually, the first time we got up there, the band, the wedding band was the Trogs.  No kidding.  When Sting and Trudy throw a party, they do not mess around.  Wait, are you serious?  They throw absolutely the wildest parties ever.  Can I do a quick little story about the Trogs?  Sure.  The only song I know is Wild Thing, right?  Yeah.  Or Wild Things, whatever.  Yeah.  And I've been a DJ and I've played music on the radio since I was 18. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  And I get these DJ nightmares where I'm a DJ.  Wow, what are they like?  Any creative person.  I think just about everyone has these type of dreams, whatever you do for a living.  So I'm in a studio and I have to find a record.  Like, the time is running out.  I got to get something on the air.  The only thing I could find is the Trogs' greatest hits.  Yeah.  It's always the Trogs for some reason.  Well, it's going to have Wild Thing on it, so you're okay. 
[01:43:30]  So where's the sweat?  And then I look at the back of the CD and I find Wild Thing.  I'm like, okay, I'm set for three minutes, whatever.  So I throw it in my nightmare and now Wild Thing is playing.  I'm like, ah.  And then the panic of the song is now fading and I don't have the next song.  And the only CD I have in the studio is the Trogs' greatest hits.  And I look again and I don't know anything else from the Trogs.  And Wild Thing isn't on there anymore.  Deep tracks.  Well, there is one other important Wild Thing, a Trogs track.  Yeah.  Which is the recording of them in the studio that is famous in the rock and roll world. 
[01:44:00]  It's like Spinal Tap where an engineer left the tape rolling while they're trying to work  out a song.  And all the effings and blindings and just like the language is unbelievable.  It's sort of like that TV show about Ozzy Osbourne, only way stupider.  Way, way stupider.  Are you trying to say the Ozzy TV show is stupid?  Are you stupid?  No.  No.  But the Trogs tape car is stupid.  He's trying to hurt me.  Okay.  But the Trogs are not.  It turns out the Trogs are not stupid because they're playing at Sting's wedding. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  And when they left the stage, they took their plectrums, guitar leads, and drumsticks with  them.  So that when the three blonde heads get up there to play, okay, all right, well, that's  what I'm going to do.  There was no guitar leads, nor plectrums, nor drumsticks.  And so Sting's son, Joe, runs off to Sting's studio at the other end of the estate and  grabs the butt.  So we're all standing there like planks on the stage.  And eventually the wedding guy, the wedding boss, the guy whose job it is to say, and now  the groom will dance with the bride. 
[01:45:00]  He says, he like gets us off the stage because it's time for the groom to dance with the bride.  So there we are.  This historic moment is about to unfold in front of our drunken crew.  And we're ordered off the stage.  So we left the stage.  And then, you know, okay, a couple more glasses of champagne and Joe Sumner comes back with  the plectrums, the guitar leads, and so we played a couple songs.  I bet you had it differently in your head.  Someday you guys would get back together. 
[01:45:30]  It would be this unbelievable moment.  I didn't imagine it was going to be like that.  Yeah, right?  No, no, no.  By the way, your nightmare, I envy.  That's not a bad one.  I dream I have night terror and I'm kind of half paralyzed.  Oh, yeah.  No, I have all that stuff.  But I mean, I know what I just said a lot of people can relate to.  You have these weird dreams and nightmares about your profession.  Yeah, but that's just not...  I've had the one where the record's running out and...  But it's always the Trogs for some reason.  The Trogs.  I don't know why.  Well, the musician one is that you're...  The band is going on stage, but you're locked in the dressing room.  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:46:00]  And you're just about to run on stage and you got no pants on.  And then, you know, you get to the drums and my hands have turned into salami.  You know, we all have these dreams.  Stupid dreams.  Yeah, really.  Do you have any of those great studio moments of the brawls or anything?  No, no.  No, I don't mean dreams.  I mean real life, like where you guys are in the studio and maybe not agreeing.  Ha ha.  Well, now, if you were to watch my movie...  Ah!  Oh.  ...this question would be answered.  Yeah.  My movie entitled Everyone Stares, which is all the Super 8 footage that I shot back 
[01:46:30]  in the day.  And, in fact, I'll be flogging it this very afternoon.  You want to help me out with the plug here?  Yeah, sure.  It's at the Virgin Megastore in Union Square, 6 o'clock tonight.  There you go.  I'm going to go down.  Wow.  I got to check that out.  Now, this movie, I need your listeners to understand a very important distinction  between this movie and your average MTV documentary about a band, which has the camera over  here and the band over there.  And the band kind of goes in front of the camera and then an important sounding voice  says, this is the band that, yeah, what a way, you know. 
[01:47:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  This film here is, the camera is the band.  You know, I was shooting during all, from starving all the way, you know, when we were  playing the little clubs, crossing America in a little van, I had the camera turning  the whole time.  And so the camera is a member of the band.  And there's the back of Sting's head on one side of the frame and the back of Andy's  head on the other side of the frame with the stuff coming right into the camera.  Can I tell you something now?  Well, that's, for the people listening right now, that sounds very normal.  Like, yeah, whatever.  You got a video camera rolling.  But we're talking 1978.  Oh, yeah.  Not many people were that smart to, you know, to roll footage back then. 
[01:47:30]  Well, there were not that many cameras.  Behind the scenes footage.  No, you're right.  You're absolutely right.  Because nowadays, carrying a video around is pretty easy.  But in those days, see, way back in those days, it was before video.  And so these films I had were like three and a half minutes celluloid things which I'd  have to send off and get developed.  And I got 50 hours of this footage.  But it's quite unique.  I mean, all of the people in front of the camera addressed the camera by name.  I got Sting and Andy shouting into the guy, hey, Stuart, too fast, you know. 
[01:48:00]  And I got the fans screaming right into the camera, Stuart, Stuart.  And I got the journalists holding their microphone right up to my camera.  And so what you get from this movie is no analysis of the police's place in rock history,  no examination of the dynamic creative forces within the – none of that.  What you get is the personal sensation of what it's like to be riding that rocket ship.  What was your motive when you were doing this?  Because this is before reality television or everybody was posing for cameras like this. 
[01:48:30]  What made you do it?  Oh, it's strictly tourism.  Just home movies.  Yeah, home movies from hell.  Well, you know, this stuff was so unbelievable that was happening in front of us that like  any tourist visiting the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel Tower or something, you want to slice  a piece off, stuff it into your suitcase so you can play with it later.  It's hysterical.  And that's pretty much what I was doing.  I just had to get all this stuff, scrape it off so I could play with it later.  You end up making home movies and you turn into the police, you know, as you're shooting this.  Well, it was pretty fortuitous, yes. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  There's probably a lot of other home movies.  There's some other guy who had this great idea.  Only problem was his band didn't turn into a mega band.  Yeah, nothing happened.  No one wants to see it.  I got rolls of this.  Let me see.  Nah, I'm busy tonight.  Yeah.  That's great, man.  That's some idea.  So tonight, you can get your very own signed autographed copy of it over at the Virgin Megastore.  In Union Square, 6 o'clock tonight.  Union Square, 6 o'clock.  You're composing for film?  Yeah, that's my day job now.  I actually have a real job now.  Anything we would know? 
[01:49:30]  Wall Street.  You know, I've forgotten what it's like almost because this movie.  Wait, did you just throw out Wall Street like it was nothing?  Throw out Wall Street.  Yeah, we love Wall Street.  Yeah, but, you know, like, come October when this movie is out in the marketplace, the promotion  job is done, I'm going to call my agent and he's going to say, Stuart who?  You know, I've been working on this movie for a year now.  It's just eaten my life.  First of all, there was making the darn thing, which was really fun.  And then it got accepted into Sundance, which turned my little toy, my little thing, and  escaped from the playpen and became this huge monster. 
[01:50:00]  The movie now owns me rather than the other way around.  Then I had to go find all these people 20 years later and get releases from them.  Then I had to go and buy all the music.  And this is the really wacky part.  And so the thing has eaten my life for about 12 months now.  And so I'm going to get back into my day job.  Wait, you had to buy the music?  You used your own music?  Yeah.  Isn't that something?  I hate lawyers.  Isn't that something?  I hate lawyers.  God, they ruin everything.  But, you know, the movie's already paid for it. 
[01:50:30]  What's the story with McCartney?  He had to ask Yoko if he could have what song on his greatest hit CD.  And she said no.  And it was his song that he wrote.  Which one?  It was the big one.  That's hard to say with the Beatles.  No, I know, I know.  The big one.  Yesterday, the Beatles, you know, the big one.  I think it might have been yesterday.  He wanted that on his greatest hit CD.  He had to ask permission.  He had to ask Yoko.  Even though he wrote it and everything, John Lennon had nothing to do with the song.  Well, it would have been a film. 
[01:51:00]  And she said no.  You know, there's a distinction.  You can make a record all you want.  And all you got to do, you don't have to ask anybody's permission.  You just pay the guy who wrote it.  But when you put music to picture, that's a whole different legal scenario.  As soon as you put music to picture, then you need a written permission from the guy  who wrote it or his estate.  And that's the problem I was in.  You know, the band, Sting, the artist, the actual guy who wrote it, he was cool.  Him and his office, they gave me everything I needed.  But it was like the publishers and everybody else who beat me up kind of bad. 
[01:51:30]  But you know what?  We're all going to do fine at the end of the day.  It's all good.  You look at like your old MTV videos and kind of chuckle?  No, I don't actually.  But if I were to look at it.  Actually, no.  I was in Italy last week and I was doing a TV show there.  And they pulled out one of the old videos.  And one of the points that I make in the movie is that, you know, because I'm shooting some  of the videos, I've got my camera turning while we're warming up and stuff.  And so I've got Sting and Andy going through the song.  And there's only two guys in front of the camera there. 
[01:52:00]  And one of them isn't because he's got his own camera.  And they're goofing off and stuff.  And I remember that the big problem with videos for the drummer is that you don't have anything  to do.  You know, in those days, they would just hose down the band with camera while they play  the song.  You sort of jig about.  And the singer looks right into the camera and he sings the song.  He's got something to the guitarist.  He can strap a guitar on.  Even though it's not plugged in, he can pretend to be playing the thing.  What's the drummer do?  You just stand there twitching and looking vaguely hostile. 
[01:52:30]  You feel like a jerk.  You know, I look at these old videos and I know I could see it after all these years,  what was going through my head.  I feel like a jerk.  I'm standing here jigging about.  You feel like a silly goose.  When it comes to the chorus, I pretend to be singing along.  I didn't sing any of that stuff, you know.  But still, that's one of the small indignities of being the drummer in a band.  You guys were right at the beginning of MTV, though, really.  You guys were seeing heavy rotation because there were not that many bands, really, that 
[01:53:00]  were being played.  We busted out together.  We played, yeah.  So, you know, you guys were there.  And now I've lost complete track of the question I was going to ask.  I don't know what you were going to ask, but I'm just so happy it happened in front of a rock legend.  Yeah, this never happens with Anthony.  Hold on.  Let me crash myself.  Anthony is usually perfect.  Let me crash myself.  All right.  Wait a minute.  You just gave that.  That does happen.  You've got the sound effect ready for it.  In fact, you didn't lose your train of thought at all.  Because it's never for me.  That's usually used on us. 
[01:53:30]  I actually wanted to ask you if at the time, because it was so new, you thought you were  just making dopey videos that weren't going to last.  Correct.  Or you thought, like, wow, this MTV thing kind of might have some legs.  Well, yeah.  The MTV thing did turn out to have legs.  And eventually, people realized what legs it had.  So they started to spend a lot of money on huge high-concept videos where they'd get a  big set.  There'd be a storyline.  Everyone had a haunted house.  Every one of them had a wine glass getting knocked over in slow-mo. 
[01:54:00]  Every one of them had a beautiful woman disappearing behind a door or something like that.  And we were just a hair ahead of that when all they did was we'd be in somewhere and  they'd hose us down with a camera and cut it together and we'd be jingling.  Yeah, it was like some stark white room or something.  Well, no.  Actually, we were touring around the world, so there'd be, like, the pyramids behind us  or something.  Don't forget all the candles.  Don't forget all the candles.  One video with all the candles.  One video with all the candles.  Was it Every Breath?  That was Every Breath.  Yeah, it was Every Breath with all the candles. 
[01:54:30]  That was a nice question.  Did you like the remake that was done with it?  Every Breath Daddy.  What was that?  With P. Diddy?  Yeah, Puff Daddy did it about Beast.  Was it Beast?  Well, it's a funny thing.  I didn't know about it until friends were telling me, hey, is that your song they're playing  at the NBA games?  Didn't he have to get your permission?  He has to get something signed to play his own music on a video.  Well, it turned out they got our manager's position.  The manager forgot to tell me, and he's my own flesh and breath.  So you didn't know about the song until you started hearing it on the radio and stuff?  Well, I didn't start hearing it.  I heard about it. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  And then I went out and got it, and I thought, well, it's got to be like, okay, they cover  the song.  Great.  My buddy made some more money from writing a great song.  He deserves it.  But wait a minute.  That actually is Andy's guitar.  Because there's a little place where he scrapes the pickup with this thing, and it goes into  the ecoplex.  And nobody would ever think to recreate that.  No, that is the master recording, which is different from if they re-record the song.  Anyone can do that.  But if they actually use the master, that's a whole different thing.  For example, you know. 
[01:55:30]  And so I'm thinking, wait a minute.  Am I going to cause a problem here?  Am I going to call up these gangsters and piss on their funeral?  Yeah, right.  Hey, listen, you guys.  Back off.  You can't use it.  Instead, you're going, good job, good job, good job, good job.  Good job, guys.  Great, great.  Do whatever you want.  Do whatever you want.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're a little late.  It's Everyone Stares to Police Inside Out by Stuart Copeland.  You're doing the signing today, Virgin Megastore in Union Square, 6 o'clock tonight.  There's nothing better.  I've been to, like, two or three signings in my life, man. 
[01:56:00]  And there is, like, what a high you get standing in line waiting to get something signed.  I just want Sabbath to it.  And there's nothing better than a signing.  I've been to a couple.  I love them.  I'm probably going to know that.  Yeah.  And we'll talk some more after the break.  All right, Stuart?  Cool.  Is that cool with you?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  I will do you with Mount Wednesday.  Mount Wednesday.  It's the O.V. and Anthony Show.  Saturday, September 16th.  What happened to just riding around the country, you with a stick in your hand and a monkey in the passenger seat? 
[01:56:30]  Opie and Anthony present...  A woman's...  Her house burned down.  She's living in a car.  Yes.  And then what do I do?  You bring her home to fuck her.  Right.  You've got to slap her around and keep her blind just in case.  For one night only...  She was mouthing.  The Laszlo Show.  I blacked out.  Is this a radio show still?  That's Saturday, September 16th from 9 till midnight Eastern on XM 202.  Opie and Anthony!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're running out of time.  We've got Stuart Copeland in studio. 
[01:57:00]  We neglected to mention, like idiots, that he is doing the walkover with us to XM.  I'm going to hang at XM a little bit, too.  We should have mentioned that a little bit earlier.  And we're giving away copies of the DVD, right?  The DVD will be giving away.  Everyone stares.  The police.  Inside.  Out.  And Stuart Copeland will be signing copies of this at the Virgin Megastore in Union Square  tonight at 6 o'clock.  Let's say hi to Carolyn in New York City.  Carolyn.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  What's up?  All right.  Stuart, an honor to speak to you.  I'm a huge police fan from growing up.  And I saw the movie on Showtime, I think, last month. 
[01:57:30]  And it was amazing.  I encourage everyone to go out and get it.  Oh, great.  Thanks for your kind words.  Oh, you're welcome.  I did have a question.  You were talking about having to track down people 20 years later and get all those  released.  Are you one of those people?  No, I was going to ask you.  What about all those people at the in-store?  I think I was a little young to be at an in-store at that point.  But what about all those people?  Well, all those people who come to the in-store tonight are probably going to get filmed.  And I'll probably have to come back to them 20 years later and get their permission  to be in my movie.  But actually, no, I won't. 
[01:58:00]  Because those kind of people are in a public place.  And I'm going to talk some legalese to you.  My lawyer says they have no expectation of privacy because they're in a public place.  But like the road crew who are in our dressing room just doing their job do have an expectation  of privacy.  And what the distinction is is beyond me.  But hey, come down to the in-store and you can be in my next movie.  Isn't there a sign usually when you walk into a place like that?  Like you might be filmed tonight and that's pretty much your disclaimer.  I guess so.  You walk by the sign, you can get shot. 
[01:58:30]  Now tell me, did you see yourself in one of those scenes?  No.  I was a fan, but I was a fan from afar.  I was like a young fan.  Ah, shucks.  What did you like about the movie?  It was just a great way of sort of going back to those days and hearing some amazing music  and also seeing the behind the scenes and what was going on of the creative process.  All right.  Very good.  Life inside the bubble.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jim in Canada.  Jim, what's up?  Oh, good morning. 
[01:59:00]  Good morning.  I was just wondering when the day you finally came to decide that the police were going to  be no more, was there one particular low that brought you to that point or was it the fact  that you were on top of the music that it was time to get out?  No, I think you're right on the second part there.  It was a high.  It wasn't a low.  It was a high.  We were already on top of the world.  Then we stayed on top of the world for another couple more years.  Then we had another album that was even bigger.  It was pretty much we were up there and we were in this cocoon and we started to wonder 
[01:59:30]  what life was actually like for real people.  Do you ever wonder what if?  What if what?  If you guys continued a few more albums, a few more years.  Yeah, we would have screwed up.  We would have jumped the shark and eventually we would have blown it.  Eventually we would have started to make lousy records and eventually we would have started  to play to smaller audiences.  But as it was, every tour we did-  Did you guys think you had one more great album in you though when you were saying goodbye?  Yeah, I still think we had several more great albums because Stink carried on writing even 
[02:00:00]  better and better songs.  You know, there are those.  Do you ever think those would have been?  Who might consider that his arrangements of them, you know, he followed his own instincts  which were, you know, without me and without Andy and of course they weren't as good.  But I mean, he was still a great songwriter and writing getting better and better.  Those would have been police songs though.  Yeah, yeah.  And so that was the gasoline that we put in our engine with the songs that Sting wrote.  And with that kind of fuel, we would have carried on doing good stuff.  But the thing was that we never saw the other side of the parabola. 
[02:00:30]  We never, you know, every tour sold out faster than the previous one.  Every single stayed in the charts longer.  Every album got to number one quicker.  We never started to see the decline.  The downslide.  The downslide, yeah.  I mean, the Who, you know, say the Rolling Stones have seen that downslide and then another  upslide and then another downslide.  They've probably been up and down like 13 times since they started.  Not many bands can say they left on top.  Yeah.  On their terms, you know, obviously, you know, some bands lost a key member and they left 
[02:01:00]  on top.  But, you know, as far as just saying goodbye, we're going to end it right here as a group.  Yeah, I guess that's rare.  You friends with Matt and Trey?  I saw your voice appeared on that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I actually was on the cutting room floor.  But, yeah, Matt and Trey.  Well, actually, Matt is a good buddy.  Is he?  Trey is kind of mysterious.  Mysterious?  But Matt is a regular guy.  Yeah.  I've met him through Les Claypool, yeah.  Yeah.  Your listeners know who the hell we're talking about here? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  Primus?  Well, yeah, no, that would be Les.  Les Claypool.  Yeah.  Who introduced me to Matt and Trey.  Yes, you know, the intro music.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Jim, did he answer your question?  Yes, it does.  Thank you.  All right, there you go.  How do you feel about Bill Ward?  I don't know who he is.  Oh, you're going to.  Well, that's silence, you guys.  Here we are in the morning drive time.  And there's a little momentary silence there, Jimmy.  You just crushed Jimmy's little heart.  His whole heart got crushed. 
[02:02:00]  I've always felt that Bill was a very underrated drummer for Sabbath.  Okay.  Do you like him or no?  Was he on the television series?  You know, I confess, I'm a total musical music snob.  It is just one of those terrible things that I have to look at myself in the mirror every  morning and face this reality that I'm a music snob.  So you don't know much about music?  Not much.  I live in an ivory tower, you see.  But yeah, you see.  You never really listened to Black Sabbath? 
[02:02:30]  No.  You know, there's a lot of people I didn't listen to.  I listened to Jimi Hendrix and that was it.  That's all I needed to do.  That doesn't matter.  No, you have no idea.  That doesn't matter.  Sabbath.  Black Sabbath.  It started and ended with Sabbath.  Hey, but look, I am a personal friend of Lemmy Motorhead.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  Does that bring us a little bit close back there?  If someone didn't listen to Sabbath, that's not bad.  Lemmy is a good buddy of mine.  I do like him.  He's quite a gambler.  He's a good boy.  Lemmy's a maniac.  He ain't a pretty sight, but he's a great guy.  No, he's on that maker's mark. 
[02:03:00]  Still takes Polaroids and chicks.  I mean, how do you not respect that?  He didn't even upgrade to digital.  I'm sorry about the Black Sabbath thing.  But no, if you didn't listen, you didn't listen.  And I've hung out with the Troggs, too, which is pretty obscure.  Yeah, all right.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Stuart.  I loved your film, and I saw that you dedicated it to your brother.  I read his book.  I met him at the backstage a few times.  I just wondered if you talked about him a little bit.  I'd rather not.  You know, my brother died a couple months ago now, and I'm still in denial. 
[02:03:30]  And I absolutely cannot think about my brother.  It's a weird kind of desertion.  I just can't even think about him in a year.  Maybe I will be able to with a smile.  But now my day is ruined.  And I promise you, I cannot think about it.  And I don't want to think about it.  And it's just too much for me.  Well, I apologize.  All right.  Sorry about that one.  Dave in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Stuart, I wanted to ask you an important question.  What's your favorite, or do you have a favorite police song?  Favorite police song?  I got a few, actually. 
[02:04:00]  Don't Stand So Close to Me, Message in a Bottle, and I guess you'd call it suicide.  Oh, yeah.  I can't stand losing you.  That's how you got it.  I got a great deranged man.  Oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  You still got to sing through it.  Well, you see, the thing is that in this movie, I took a lot of police tracks, and I got the  live recordings, and the studio vocals, the record company opened up the vault for me,  so I got all the multi-track recordings. 
[02:04:30]  So I was able to take studio vocals where Sting banked up all these vocals and put them  on these live performances and live improvisations, and I call these tracks derangements, which  I use to score the film.  Now, my colleagues in the police have not, they've given me a red light.  I'm not permitted to release these tracks unto the people, which I still got some more  begging and pleading to do, but I think, you know, but you can hear them, you know, when  you buy the DVD.  There's all kinds of extra material, by the way, that you didn't get on the Showtime show. 
[02:05:00]  There's another 15 minutes of footage of cool stuff.  There's another 15 minutes of live stuff, and then Andy came over one night, and I served  him a lot of wine, and the two of us watched the movie and did kind of an alternative voiceover,  director's commentary thing, where the two of us are just, you know, that actually is  the home movie.  Hey, I remember that shot.  What were you wearing, that jacket?  You know, that kind of thing.  But also, for all the menus on the DVD, each one, if you just sit there on the menu, you  get to hear these cool tracks that I made called Derangements.  Derangements.  Yeah.  Let's go to Frank. 
[02:05:30]  Frank, what's up?  Yeah, big fan of Stewart.  I heard him credit before Sting's songwriting capabilities.  I don't know how many people realize that Stewart himself is a brilliant songwriter.  One of my favorite albums is the material.  Oh, now you're talking.  No, no.  The material you did under the suit of the McClark 10.  I don't know a lot of people.  I'm still denying that.  What are you talking about?  No, no.  This terrible accusation.  I'll take all the credit, though.  Thank you.  No, I was just curious.  I mean, that work that you did, I loved as a fan of you personally as a solo artist. 
[02:06:00]  And, you know, you had a lot of success, more or less, with the soundtrack work you've done  now, Equalizer, Rumblefish soundtrack.  I'm just curious why you didn't ever continue more pop-oriented solo music on your own.  Well, every summer I go to Italy, just because I like Italy.  And I have a couple different bands that I play with there.  You know, one band of my own.  Then there's this group of 20 musicians that I play with there, which is like this local  kind of folk music called the pizzica, the Night of the Tarant.  You know, I got, so I go and get my drums off every summer for one month in Italy, just 
[02:06:30]  because I like it there.  And, in fact, I'm playing, day after tomorrow, on Saturday, I'm playing in New Jersey, the  Modern Drummer Festival.  They've dragged, you know, they keep trying to get me to play there every year.  And I say, look, I haven't got a band.  I haven't got an act, you know.  But I just got these guys in Italy.  So they've actually flown my Italian band over, and I'm going to play with them in Jersey  on Saturday.  Where in Jersey?  You want to know?  New Jersey Performing Arts Center.  Oh, P.S.C., we were there.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to, boy, I am looking at your resume there. 
[02:07:00]  Man, some movies.  Quite a few.  Quite a few.  About 30 or 40 movies, a few television series.  I got an Emmy nomination the other year, last year for, what the hell was that called?  Dead Like Me.  How'd you get into that?  I got a call from Francis Coppola one day.  Hey, there you go.  That's how it happens.  I never had an idea that I'd be doing that kind of work, but he called.  He called you, too, huh?  Yeah, and why would he do that? 
[02:07:30]  Like, no offense.  I'll tell you why.  He denies this, and I'm sorry to have to go against what Uncle Francis claims to be the  story, but it was his son.  His son, Roman, said, you know, Dad, you've got to get this cool guy from this school group.  You know, they were teenagers at the time, but they're all grown up now, and Sophia was  just a little tiny little bean at that point, and look what she's been able to do.  Anyway, so he called, and then I became a film composer.  Apparently so.  I guess you had it in you, because it wasn't just a one-off. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, oh, boy, we gave this guy a shot, and he sucked.  You know, music and everything that people do that they're good at.  You guys have got a gift for talking into a microphone and keeping the attention of your  listeners.  I happen to have a gift for banging things, you know, and making music.  Jimmy has that gift, too.  Yeah, I mean...  He gets paid for it, and I spend cash.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a blessing.  All right, one more.  Hey, Levin, before we move on, let me just give a plug to my buddies. 
[02:08:30]  Shout out to Modern Drummer Magazine, who are actually...  Who flew my band over from Italy and everything.  I just want to make clear that I'm down with Modern Drummer Magazine.  Right on.  Let's say hi to Carpio from Brooklyn.  Carpio.  Yeah, how you doing, Stuart?  Hey.  I've heard this story about how back in the days of the police, you and Andy Summers  like viciously hated Sting, and so much that you wrote in tape on your drumhead a certain  C word for a woman's nether regions.  Well, there was an F word, too, which, you know... 
[02:09:00]  No.  We actually got along really well.  As you can see in my film, as those couple of callers who called in who have seen the  film can testify, there is not a frame in my 50 hours of footage where we're shouting  and screaming, or even grumpy.  And what's clear when you watch the movie is that we liked each other a lot.  You know, Sting looks into the camera, and he's got a real warm chuckle on his face.  We're goofing off.  We're enjoying each other's company, hanging out together.  I have several scenes of Sting beating the crap out of Andy, but they're both laughing 
[02:09:30]  hysterically.  What about in the movie?  It was fun to beat up Andy, because he's little.  Who actually suggested that you guys, you were on top and you weren't fighting?  Who actually said, look, let's end this?  Um, well, Sting had wanted to leave for quite a while, and it wasn't because he was angry.  It wasn't because, you know, he hated us or hated our music.  It was because of a very simple and easy to understand thing.  He's a songwriter.  And at first, he was an unknown songwriter, and he appreciated having Andy and I collaborate 
[02:10:00]  with him on his songs and make them better than, you know, he'd write a few chords and  a bit of a melody, but he didn't have a lot of self-confidence.  So he appreciated it when Andy and I would come and say, oh, that's brilliant, that's  great, let's, you know, let's turn it into this.  You know, we did Roxanne that way and all these songs that way.  As years went by, and he got more affirmation of his gift, and he got better at it, too,  by the way, and he'd recorded a few albums by now, and he starts to understand how you  make records, how you arrange a song, and now he's writing songs.  And he doesn't, you know, the same way with, it's the current era of Lennon, McCartney, 
[02:10:30]  and so on, is an aberration.  Normally, a composer such as Mozart or Wagner or whoever, they don't stop halfway through  the composition, they complete the composition.  So Sting is now writing songs where he doesn't just have the lyric, doesn't just have the  melody and the chords, he has the whole thing in his mind, fully arranged, and he's actually  quite a brilliant arranger.  Not only that, he's done a few albums now, and he knows how to use a studio, how to record  it.  He doesn't really need to compromise anymore.  So he arrives in the studio with a completely, complete song. 
[02:11:00]  So you just called him a selfish bastard?  No, no, no, no.  He just didn't need you guys.  No, he was not selfish.  Is that what you're saying?  He didn't need you guys anymore?  For Andy and I, our position was that we like to take those semi-formed songs and turn  and put our own stamp on it, and that's why we're not session players.  Right.  So that was our point of view.  But Sting was patient and held off, and he was able to make those compromises for five  albums, for eight years.  At that point, he's free to go.  It was amazing to have a songwriter, such a good songwriter, with such a great, unique 
[02:11:30]  voice, too.  He's a pretty good singer.  I hired him originally as a bass player who could sing.  I had no idea that he was such a great singer, and no idea at all that he could write a song.  Neither did he, by the way.  It'd be funny if you put another band together and just asked him if he'd play bass and not  sing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, that's our music.  We've got to get out of here.  They're going to shut us off.  So the big plug, Jimmy, can you help me out here?  It's called The Police, Everyone Stares, The Police Inside Out.  But it is like a documentary-style behind-the-scenes DVD by Stuart Copeland, who is doing an in-store. 
[02:12:00]  Virgin Megastore, yeah.  Virgin Megastore on Union Square, 6 p.m.  They will allow this to be a line, so get there.  And meeting someone like that is quite a hard, man.  And we're going to hand out some copies of the DVD on the street in a few minutes here.  Quickly?  Yeah.  You want to win a MacBook, send us a 30-second production piece about The Opie and Anthony  Show by October 2nd.  Send your entry to 923freefm.com by September 29th.  We ran out of our music.  That's how late we are tonight.  That's how it goes. 
[02:12:30]  Stuart, it's a pleasure.  Thank you so much.  Well, thank you guys.  I hope you had a good time today.  Yeah, cool.  All right.  Good morning, radio.  If you're not joining us at XM, have a great day.  Hey, voiceover guy.  My commute isn't bad thanks to Opie and Anthony on my radio, but I need something more.  Hmm.  How about female protuberancy?  Sure, but how?  Just go to opiandanthony.com and get a WOW sticker for free.  Then, smack it on your car and wait for the lovely ladies to display their fun bag.  Wow.  Great. 
[02:13:00]  Thanks for all your help, Mr. Voiceover.  It's my pleasure.  Here at the O&A Show, female protuberances are our business.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM here in New York City.  Stuart Copeland, everyone.  Stuart Copeland.  Yeah.  Woo!  What the? 
[02:13:30]  What do we got over there?  What?  I don't know.  It looks like, um...  What kind of uniform is that?  Navy J-R-O-T-C.  Oh.  Oh, you look about 12.  ROTS-E.  Are you going to defend the nation?  No, I'm not either.  In a couple years?  Maybe.  I don't know.  How old are you, son?  I'm 14.  You're 14 and you're in the ROTS-E's, as they used to call it.  It's the Junior ROTS-E.  Junior ROTS-E.  Yeah, for high school students.  And you know something?  What are you going to do with this?  What are you going to do with this?  The nation.  This young man. 
[02:14:00]  Hopefully it will lead to a career in law enforcement or something.  Law enforcement.  But see, this is someone at 14.  You actually got, like, something going where it could...  Yeah, you could, like, become a naval aviator if you want.  Yeah, I could.  What the hell did you do to earn all those ribbons?  He just showed us a salad dressing on his chest here.  Where did you earn all that stuff?  I had, like, a wall on my chest.  What did you do?  Each one signifies some special thing that I did.  Uh, do you remember?  The mainstream, like, exemplary conduct. 
[02:14:30]  But you're only 14.  That's my personal appearance.  Yeah.  You're 14.  You look adorable.  You've done a lot of good stuff in a few short years.  Isn't he the cutest thing?  You're, like, the cutest little thing.  You want to see Pepper?  I have a little boy scout.  You're going to go and apprehend the criminal.  They're going to go, aww.  Compared to this?  Come on.  Are you a police fan?  Stuart Copeland fan?  What are you?  Uh, I'm not really sure.  He's a fan of the police department.  That's what he wants to become.  The police broke up six years before you were born.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  Well, congrats, and I hope things go well for you.  Thanks a lot, man.  Look, fine in your little uniform.  Little uniform.  Okay, fine in your little uniform.  That would be creepy.  Just the cutest little thing.  Isn't that adorable?  Look at this guy.  All right, let's walk.  We'll hand out DVDs as we walk.  Everyone gets a DVD that wants one today.  Elliot, what's the deal?  Well, this is the Elliot that we love, by the way.  He's got to sign one.  It's a Virgin Megastore tonight, 6 p.m.  That's Virgin Union Square. 
[02:15:30]  Stuart will be signing copies of the new DVD.  Police, everyone stares inside out.  Very good.  Elliot, everyone.  This is something very New York about this, walking down the streets of New York with  microphones and a crowd of people waving the DVD at everybody.  You know what's weird, too?  Barely anyone notices.  And nobody even notices.  All these passers-by, they got, look at them.  They're all just walking past.  You know what, you are really, really famous.  And most of these people passing, probably listened to the police growing up.  They will not notice you today. 
[02:16:00]  They won't look up.  They won't look up.  One day we...  This is New York.  They got important business.  Well, one day we walked with the Stanley Cup.  And no one even cared.  No one looked.  They didn't think it was the real thing.  They just didn't look.  You know what?  But also, a lot of people have iPods on.  I wouldn't doubt a few of them are listening to the police.  That's what I'm saying.  Pass right by you and have no idea.  Wait, let's ask Andrew.  Andrew.  Oh, wait, wait.  This guy's playing Black Sabbath for Jimmy.  Start off.  The wizard.  The wizard. 
[02:16:30]  Black Sabbath a lot more. 
[02:17:00]  Is that what they sounded like?  It sure is a different sounding Sabbath, but...  Andrew, are you a fan of the police?  I'm a fan of the police.  I hate them.  You hate the band, the police?  Now we're getting some angst.  I hate police.  No, not...  Stop making a joke.  It's a band.  Yeah.  It's a band.  You ever hear of the band, The Police?  No, I didn't.  Have a good day.  That's Andrew.  No, I get that a lot.  We're not getting anything out of him today.  No, he's our homeless friend.  Take it easy.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, get a plug in.  What's your name, bro?  I'm Chris Bednar.  What are you about?  Just on my day off from work, I'm going to pick some chicks up at the three museums.  The Whitney, the Met, and the National Museum.  Just seeing...  I like how you guys are seeing everybody on their miserable commute to work and all.  Just paying my respects.  You're going to pick some chicks up at the museum?  How do you do that?  At the Museum of National History?  Well, yeah, I know.  Well, I met all the wrong people at the dance club.  That's where all the hot chicks are.  I got these membership cards for my college.  So, like, I'm going to try something.  You are a shaky lad. 
[02:18:00]  You guys want to know with me?  I got a family duel after the show or whatever.  You're a real optimist if you think you're going to get laid in the museum.  I know.  You never know, man.  You never know.  Call us if anything happens, all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Straight up, guys.  All right, man.  Thanks for the song on the old harmonica.  You might want to try a bar, though.  The museum thing doesn't work out.  Yeah.  All right.  Look, there you go.  People are recognizing Stuart Copeland.  People are recognizing Stuart Copeland.  Hanging from the ceiling.  I'm sorry.  Oh, there we go.  I'm just over here getting my picture taken.  There it is.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, one more.  Okay, sure.  Oh, the two creepiest guys in New York.  Just look up the porch, Stuart.  I'm sure he's thrilled.  No, these are not the two creepiest guys in New York.  There's a lot creepier people.  Yeah, a couple.  All right.  That's cool.  There they go.  These are good people of New York.  Stuart Copeland, everyone, from the police.  Stuart Copeland.  They have headphones on.  They're listening to their music.  They're looking.  People are afraid if they look up, they're going to get stabbed.  Right.  There's a mob of us walking down the street here with microphones.  Yeah.  Everybody's walking past.  Hey, we should talk to our Australian friend. 
[02:19:00]  Bro.  He's still here?  Yeah, he's over here.  This guy's visiting from Australia.  What did you do last night?  Fuck all, mate.  Nothing.  Went to Times Square, ate at a hard rock cafe, and just walked around.  Yeah.  Walked around.  There's so much to see.  I don't know.  When are you leaving?  Sunday, I believe.  What are you doing today?  Don't know.  Yeah.  Walk around.  Maybe Brooklyn Bridge.  Head over there.  Maybe Staten Island.  Apparently, there's a ferry.  Apparently, there's a ferry.  I love that.  Apparently, there's a ferry.  It's called the Staten Island Ferry.  Yep. 
[02:19:30]  And so, I'll go over and go on that.  You ever hear of the band, The Police?  Yeah, of course.  My old man loves them.  My dad loves them.  I get that all the time.  It's like, oh, man, dude, dude, dude.  My mom really loves your band.  Yeah, my dad.  What about your sister?  That's Stuart Copeland of The Police, obviously.  Yeah, the drummer.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  My dad will be very, very jealous.  You want to get a picture?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take that back.  It'll cost you $10, but that's half price for you.  There you go. 
[02:20:00]  Look at Elliot.  Always promoting.  Yeah, nice plug.  Freaking Elliot.  That picture's going on in Australia.  No camera.  Oh, no, there was a camera, but it's...  All right, throw in the DVD and the shot.  Very good.  You got to love Elliot.  Do we have a copy of the DVD for this guy's father?  Elliot, where's our copy?  He needs a copy.  He needs a copy, Elliot.  All right, which way?  Let's walk this way today.  Why not?  Watch out.  Ah, we'll turn right.  Oh, step on these bugs that are in the crosswalk.  Oh, they're just...  Oh, wait, they're little...  Look how adorable you are. 
[02:20:30]  This building here is the building which used to be the FBI booking agency, which used  to book our gigs.  Right here?  Yeah, right here.  This building right here.  57th and 6th.  Yeah.  Do you like New York, Stuart?  I do.  It's a hub.  When you arrive in New York, you are at the center of the universe.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  You get the feeling that if, you know, the king of Nepal is in town, I'm probably going  to bump into him on the street here.  The pinnacle.  Yeah.  I bumped into John Madden last night. 
[02:21:00]  He is a miserable guy.  Is he grumpy?  He's back in the neighborhood, Jim.  You'll see him.  I want to.  I want to meet him.  Is he always alone?  Yesterday, I had a lot of star sightings.  I saw John Madden.  I saw the father from Harry Potter.  And I saw Brian Dennehy.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  All in one day.  All within like a 10-minute walk.  Three nice photo ops.  Hello.  Look at.  Oh, Steve and Eric are being playful.  There's a dog there.  Let's see if we can get a wolf. 
[02:21:30]  Let's see if we can get a wolf there.  What's that?  That guy's pretty creepy.  Which guy?  Look.  The creepy guy.  Oh, my God.  Is he awful.  The ball with little blue sunglasses.  I would have thought you guys would be used to this.  Oh, yeah.  We do.  We just point out like the ultra creepy kind of John Carr looking guys, you know?  He was really disturbing.  We see something different every day, Stuart.  Whoa.  Just lost a hat.  That's a rock.  You got that?  Somebody lost their hat. 
[02:22:00]  That's E-Rock's hat.  That's a stupid hat hat he has.  And then we comment about the posters on this wall.  Nokia, 57th and 5th.  Scissor Sisters.  Ta-da.  Hard to kill.  What's that?  Oh, TV on the radio.  That's a really cool band.  They got a new album out today.  Rolling Stones.  Rolling Stones.  I've heard of them.  Yeah.  You know.  And there's our pal John Mayer.  I heard of them.  I actually got his CD.  I bought it yesterday, and I listened to most of it in the car.  I enjoyed it very much.  It's good, huh?  Now, Continuum music by John Mayer. 
[02:22:30]  What do you like?  I think I've heard of him.  Do you listen to today's music at all, Stuart?  I live in an ivory tower.  Yeah, I know.  I listen to bluegrass, death metal music, spinal, let's see, Slipknot is my current favorite.  Oh.  There's a band that was popular when you guys were doing the thing.  R.E.M.  Look at them.  Still blasting away.  Well, it's another greatest hit.  It's the best of the IRS years.  But look, there's a shot.  1982 to 87.  The shot.  One of the guys is actually mid-air.  He's jumping.  They never jumped.  They always just stood there. 
[02:23:00]  I don't remember R.E.M. ever jumping.  They never jumped.  It's got to be a fake.  Photoshop.  Photoshop.  And then what the hell is that for?  Can't read it.  I can't even read.  Is that...  Mars Volta.  The Mars Volta Ampli...  Ampute...  What the hell is that?  Amputech-ture.  Hey, Elliot, you got the U2 DVD as well?  Yeah, I just gave it to somebody.  Did you give me one?  Yeah, I had the studio for it.  It was all about U2 and the police when I was growing up.  Yeah? 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Somebody got it.  Oh, you only brought one?  I brought two, man.  Someone's giving up their copy.  I'll tell you right now.  Producer Steve.  Yeah, baby.  Thank you.  I could go buy it.  I should buy it.  You should buy it.  Just take it.  Let the guy who makes $18,000 a year buy it.  Come on.  Do you think it?  All right.  Well...  And that's the walk, Stuart.  That's what we do every day.  Just walk the streets of New York.  Then we go upstairs...  Hassling people.  We go upstairs and continue our radio show, and we get to curse now because we're on satellite 
[02:24:00]  radio.  Really?  This is satellite radio?  Yeah.  Yeah, now we're on satellite.  You can use the F word?  Oh, yeah.  As much as you want.  There you go.  That felt good.  Isn't that odd?  That felt good.  Isn't that weird to do on the radio?  Simple pleasures.  You know, in Italy, I just came back from Italy, and they have a word there which is  so dirty that even, like, the most hardened tour manager goes pale and starts shaking.  And I can say it in English.  It's porcodillo.  Porcodillo?  It just means pig gone. 
[02:24:30]  But you say that in Italy, man, in traffic stops.  That's a biggie.  We need a word like that in English.  Well, we got one.  Yes.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  The girls never like it.  Well, the big C-bomb.  Oh.  I wouldn't say it because it's ladies.  This is worse than the C-bomb.  I thought you meant black neighbors.  Oh.  Jesus.  All right.  Porcodillo.  All right.  I want to learn that one.  If you really want to get attention in Milan or something like that, you go with that one.  Blurt that one out?  Yeah.  Blurt that one out, man.  It stops everything.  Now, would guys say that in an argument to each other?  Like, is that, like, the ultimate insult? 
[02:25:00]  Pretty much, yeah.  But then the best place to drop it is, like, gratuitously.  Excuse me, can you tell me the way to the post office, the post-officio, posti, post-officio,  porcodillo.  And then, hey.  Do they think you're cursing or do they think you made a mistake?  They know that you're cursing.  Do you live in Italy?  No, I go there every summer.  You just like, uh, hang there?  I like it there.  Cool.  If you can swing it, why not?  I figured I'd ask.  Fair question.  Was it?  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  I was hoping for some real unbelievable answer.  No.  We'd be out here another 15 minutes hanging like we're pals.  That's a good question I'd like to ask.  If you had to go over your career, what would you say was the worst career decision you made?  The worst career decision I made?  The worst career decision I made?  It's kind of hard to say.  There has to be one you look at and go, look.  I know what some of the good ones were.  Yeah.  That bass player I saw up in Newcastle?  That was a good choice.  Was there any, like, soundtracks?  I feel like George Bush here.  No, I never made any mistakes. 
[02:26:00]  None you want taking off the resume?  Yeah.  Like, that one, yeah.  It's funny.  Out of my right ear, I hear Elliot going, Virgin Union Square.  That guy's good.  Never fired up.  Get over here, Elliot.  We love Elliot.  The big plug, Elliot.  Elliot's good.  Careful on this one.  What are you plugging?  You two?  Well, we want you to do it with...  No.  All right.  Switch horses here.  It's all about Stuart Copeland.  Listen.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We want you to do the plug, but we want you to do it with a lot of curses because we're  on satellite.  They like that.  God damn cocksucking street day today for the police. 
[02:26:30]  Everyone stares inside out.  Now, this is a unique setup here because...  Not enough curses.  What we're talking about here is a film that had a great buzz at Sundance.  Great fucking buzz.  Great fucking buzz.  Stuart obviously been, you know...  Fucking great guy.  ...the genius fucking film composer, you know, since his incredible days of being an octopus  drummer with the police.  But the real excitement is tonight, 6 p.m. at the Virgin Megastore, Union Square, where  Stuart will actually be signing copies of the brand new DVD, The Police, Inside Out, Everyone 
[02:27:00]  Stares.  And, of course, he'll be signing these suckers, and it'll be a big event, and everybody's got  to show up, and that's all I got.  Suckers.  That's kind of a limb, man.  Suckers.  Wow.  You can do better than that.  That's the language, sir.  Fucking DVDs.  Language.  With that, I think we say goodbye to Stuart Copeland.  It's been a pleasure.  It's been a pleasure.  Thanks, man.  I mean, if you want to come upstairs and curse, you're more than welcome.  It's up to you.  I can't talk like this on CNN, can I?  Please curse on CNN.  We'll plug you like no one's ever plugged you.  All right.  Just one fuck.  Drop the C-bomb.  Directed at the anchor. 
[02:27:30]  Look at us, man.  He does our show and then CNN.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, would that be yours?  See you later, guys.  Let's go upstairs.  Take it easy, man.  We've got to continue upstairs.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care, Elliot.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Are you?  Okay, you coming?  All right.  We're heading in.  Good luck.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Massican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex. 
[02:28:00]  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The encloth of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvirus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[02:28:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bat.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:29:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:29:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:30:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  All right.  I'm.  Shit.  He's.  Dick.  And.  Cock.  And this is pretty funny.  Let's start with Dan in Pennsylvania.  Hey, Dan.  How are you today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Did I just hear Jimmy asked Stuart for just one fuck?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Andrew in Queens. 
[02:30:30]  Andrew.  Yes, sir.  Andrew.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good episode tonight.  Today.  Nice walk over.  Yeah.  The Stuart Copeland interview was kick ass.  I just.  A couple weeks ago, I was listening to Ron and Fez talking shit about Stuart Copeland.  I thought that was a little fucked up, but.  Are they talking shit about Stuart Copeland and the police?  Yes, sir.  Oh.  What could they possibly. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  What did they say?  They were saying that the oyster head move was a bad move for him and that he hasn't been  doing anything.  He's been sitting on his ass collecting a police check.  A police check.  He actually did a lot after the police.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Like 72.  72 things that he had done as far as composing on Internet Movie Database.  Was he the brains behind the police, you think?  Because he discovered Sting, right?  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  I guess so.  Yeah.  You think he was the brain behind that whole thing?  What do you think, Andrew?  Quickly.  I think he was a big part of that.  A big part of the movement.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, but.  It was a great interview until we got that phone call about Stuart Copeland's brothers.  Gee.  God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was really a downer.  I thought that was the best part of it.  Not to be a dick, but like, wow, you had, like, no one, it wasn't on purpose, but yeah,  man.  That is so uncomfortable.  Well. 
[02:32:00]  That's life.  Jesus.  That's all I got, guys.  Thanks for having me.  What are you going to do?  What happened to Stuart's brother?  Does anyone even know?  I don't know.  You want to look it up?  I don't know.  You know?  I'm wondering if it was a sudden death because he seemed like, you know, it probably, I mean,  whatever.  I have no idea.  I mean, it sounded like it was something sudden.  Again, you're diagnosing and speculating with something you have no idea about.  The only, I'm so bad, like, I will actually, now I'll try to argue the point that it was  sudden.  I don't know where I come up with a medical theory. 
[02:32:30]  I'm a dropout.  A high school dropout.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we got the video wrong.  Travis in Denver, what's up?  Oh, hey, man.  I wanted to let you know that it was King of Pain, the police song where they're running  through with the candles.  It wasn't Every Breath You Take.  Well, he even said, I think it was Every Breath.  I mean, he didn't even know the name of some of his songs.  Wasn't there a Sting, like, solo thing that he did where he did the candles? 
[02:33:00]  I'm not sure.  Wasn't there big, long, big candle things and he was knocking them over as he was running?  That was King of Pain, I guess.  What's a Sting solo song?  I have no idea of any Sting solo songs.  I'm sure I've heard a million of them.  Brand new day.  Huh.  Yeah.  I've never heard of either one of those.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy.  If I ever lose my faith in you.  No, you won't.  There'll be nothing.  Go ahead, sir.  What are you saying?  Oh, I understand that you might be playing Denver October 28th at the Comedy Works.  Yes, I'm doing the Comedy Works for three nights in October. 
[02:33:30]  It's my first trip to Denver.  So let's all hold it.  Oh, man.  We are.  Oh, they call it the Mile High City, Jimmy.  The Mile High City.  I've heard that.  Yeah.  I'm going to stay in a hotel in the mountains.  My friend Larry Durker is going to hook me up with a snowcat.  If you've got to get in touch with me, just call KDK12.  Actually, KDK1.  Yeah, I'm going to stay at the Overlook Hotel.  It doesn't matter.  Jesus, if you've forgotten one number in an obscure reference, it was perfect. 
[02:34:00]  Stewart's brother died of melanoma at 57 in Los Angeles.  So I couldn't have been wronger.  It was something that was not sad.  It was something that was diseased.  Once again, jeez.  All right, let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, that DVD you gave the Australian guy won't work over in Australia because their DVD players  are a different format than ours.  You can buy one that covers all of them, though.  I have one that covers everything, and I'm sure he does, too.  Your DVDs will play in the PAL format? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, you just got to get a plug-in.  Yeah.  I just want to thank you guys for the pictures Thursday after the Helium show.  Why was that?  Paul and Connor, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, Paul.  Hey, what's going on?  Not much, man.  Listen, I just got my XM radio hooked up.  I've been listening to you guys for about, like, 15 minutes now.  A funny fucking shit, buddy.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you, my friend.  I have no idea what you've missed.  Not much, actually.  That was important.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thanks.  All right, bud. 
[02:35:00]  Brendan in Cincinnati.  Brand new fan right there.  Yeah.  Brendan.  Welcome.  Yes.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, that video where Sing runs around?  Yeah.  With the candles?  Right.  Wrapped around your fingers.  Not King of Pain.  Ah, wrapped around your finger.  That's the third song now.  Every Breath You Take, King of Pain, and now it's wrapped around your finger.  What's the real answer?  I'm going to go with...  You're going to go with... 
[02:35:30]  Slow Burries.  Always eating on the air.  I am, too.  You're going to annoy people.  You know what?  You're going to write letters.  I'm going to go with wrapped around your finger.  What?  Are you watching the video?  Yeah.  I was just waiting for YouTube to learn.  There it is.  There it is right there.  There's the candle being lit.  Are you putting on CNN to see when he does his interview?  All right.  Are you ready for this? 
[02:36:00]  Where's Jimmy?  Jimmy's going to have to...  You ready for this?  Hold on, Opie.  Oh, I thought you left the room.  No, I was right next to you.  Scott in Virginia.  Jimmy, talk to this a lot.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Scott.  Hey.  Water.  Hey, there.  I went to a birthday party this past weekend for a friend of mine who was, he's 22, and  he was going to hook up with this 20-year-old, and there was this chick there that was fucking  banging.  And after old she was, she said she was 16, which was slightly disappointing.  Why?  Well, I was disappointing. 
[02:36:30]  He was joking, sorry, just saying that that's really young and sexy.  Go ahead.  Joking?  Well, yeah, on the radio.  But anyway...  Please.  You think I wasn't checking out that little Boy Scout going, oh, there's a lot of guys.  Little Boy Scout.  I'm not gay, and I don't like kids, but for some reason, I really wanted to teach him a  lesson.  Something about them in uniform.  This is something.  I wanted to fuck the hat off them.  He was just the cutest little thing.  Hey, I swear to God, I didn't want to say he looked like the gay kid in fucking this 
[02:37:00]  boy's life.  Really?  You want to pet pepper?  You want to pet pepper?  Oh, right, right, right.  His little hat tilted.  Oh, that plays for the other team.  Go ahead.  Yeah, he fights for the pink team.  Yeah, fights for the pink team.  I called him gay.  Well, he couldn't sue you for slander.  Go ahead, sir.  What are you saying?  All right, so anyway, this girl starts kissing and licking on her 16-year-old friend, you  know, which, you know, I've heard this happen at parties a lot before, you know, it was  the first time I've actually seen it, so.  By the way, this guy's 29.  Are you 29? 
[02:37:30]  And the girl's 16.  Good boy.  Okay.  Wow.  What did you do besides spill clam chowder in your pants?  So anyway, I get back home, and I, you know, I might have, you know, found out her MySpace  page, and I might have, you know, instigated a message to her saying, you know.  Uh-oh.  That's where you're going to get in trouble.  I said, you know, you girls are crazy, you know, stay out of trouble, blah, blah, blah.  So then she starts writing back a little bit.  You know, the last comment, last email she sent me Monday night was, well, I'm about to  go to bed, but here's my number. 
[02:38:00]  Call me tomorrow after 7.  All right.  Needless to say, I didn't call, but, you know.  Not only should you not call, burn that number right now.  Here's what you do, sir.  Are you nuts?  Pick up the phone and call her, and pick her up and go for a ride.  Wear sweatpants with no underwear, but don't let her touch it.  You're going to go to jail, stupid.  I know it's tempting.  Believe me.  I've been tempted.  You can't do it.  It's fucking hard.  Or if you're going to call, call from a pay phone down the street.  So you've come over this house for sex. 
[02:38:30]  You're going to be on Dateline, dude.  You're going to be famous.  We're talking to Dateline dudes soon, I think.  This is Scott from Virginia.  He's come for sex with a 16-year-old girl.  MySpace.  What it is, is that she, I know she's active with other guys.  There was a black guy that was there.  Oh, now you're ruining the whole story.  That's not even worth it.  So she's tainted.  Possibly getting arrested.  So, dude, her mind.  But see, being that she was active before, that might cut down on the. 
[02:39:00]  Is it really underage sex if the girl can't feel it?  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I mean.  Okay, you keep talking.  There's no reason for us to communicate.  Okay, you're just going to kind of do a dissertation.  No need to have a give and take.  It's all about you.  Go ahead, sir.  Do your monologue.  Didn't mean to interrupt and actually try to have a human conversation.  My fault.  Sorry.  I had headphones and a microphone.  I just figured we could talk back and forth.  But apparently I stepped all over your toes while you were doing your album.  Go ahead.  So I'm just thinking, you know, being that she's already been, you know, active with other 
[02:39:30]  dudes, that they might cut down on her, you know, running her mouth or anything.  Right.  I understand the dialogue in your head, dude.  Well, I'm doing your album.  Believe me.  The fact that she's a dirty girl turns you on.  You're like, she's banged other guys, so she'll probably keep her mouth shut.  And you're my spacing her.  You're asking for trouble.  You're asking.  And I'm a pervert.  I'm telling you that, dude.  I'm a fucking filth.  That's why I'm sorry.  Once again, you just feel free.  What do you think we are, sir?  Are we all actors in your play? 
[02:40:00]  Like, you're the director and star, and we're just fucking, our job is to nod when you talk.  We all have feelings and hearts and thoughts, sir, and opinions, and we try to offer them  and share back and forth.  I'm sorry, sir.  No, don't be sorry.  It's all right.  You're not used to being on the radio or obviously talking.  You're fucking like Tom Hanks in that fucking movie we went down in the FedEx plane.  It's just you and Wilton on the island.  Yeah, you're talking to a soccer ball with a smiley face painted on it, and you're not used  to it answering you.  All right.  Whatever, sir.  You go right ahead.  I didn't mean actually, you know.  Let's go to Steve in Pittsburgh. 
[02:40:30]  Good luck, sir.  Steve?  No, well, he's going to talk to Scott.  Yeah, Steve.  Yes.  It was a volleyball first.  Whatever it was, that was a fucking ball.  Help us out a little bit and just go with some of this crap, please.  Yeah, it was a volleyball.  Who cares?  The next thing, this guy's a jackass.  If he gets online, he can find the age of consent in every state.  It's listed.  Most states it's 16, as long as you don't show them porn or give them alcohol.  Some states it's as low as 14.  Here's the bottom line with that age.  Do a little research.  Well, hold on.  And do research on this.  There's a certain thing with age where if you have to only be a certain amount of years 
[02:41:00]  apart.  Right.  Like, if you're 21 and you have sex with a 16-year-old in certain states, that's probably  allowed because it's a few years.  You're 29.  You fuck a 16-year-old.  You are going to jail.  I think that that's the case.  Until you're 18.  Then you're 18.  All bets are off.  You can do what you want.  Tea bag, laugh, ass-eating, ass-fingering, tit-twisting, shitting on their chest and rubbing  in their hair and saying, you silly goose, sucking their toes, jerking off in their shoes.  What about ass-flu eating? 
[02:41:30]  No, that's 21.  Oh, that's true.  The ass-flu eating is 21 simply because of the germs involved in bacteria.  Bacteria takes on a whole different world.  You knew that.  Why'd you ask?  Yeah, most states don't have that age range anymore.  It's just a straight 16 or whatever.  Okay, good.  Then I was wrong.  Thanks a lot for letting me babble on while you just sat there with all the knowledge,  fucking legal expert.  Thanks for chiming in with shit.  I'm a cop, man.  Are you really?  I'm a cop, you idiot.  All right, good.  Where are you a cop?  Somewhere east.  All right, good.  So you apparently know every law of every state. 
[02:42:00]  Well, Senator Kenney was a cop, but he's borderline retarded.  I don't care.  You're not a fucking district attorney or a lawyer.  You're a cop.  Here's what you know how to do.  They said arrest you, so I'll arrest you.  You don't try the cases.  Your job is to fucking bring them in.  Let's get a bill in Jersey.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, fellas.  Hey.  I just want to tell you on Friday on 96.5 in Philly.  What's 96.5 in Philly?  Radio station, Chio in the morning. 
[02:42:30]  Who?  Chio.  Oh, Chio in the morning.  What kind of show is it?  It's like a talk radio, and then they have a little music.  Good.  So it's awful.  Go ahead.  Mousetrap trivia.  Yeah, the Mousetrap trivia is being taken by a lot of people.  Yeah.  That was featured in a huge article that was done for Billboard magazine, was it?  Or R&R?  Or are they the same now?  I don't know.  And that was the big bit that they talked about in our huge article that went to every radio station in America. 
[02:43:00]  So there's no real surprise there that some of these asses would now do that bit.  Oh, Chio.  Chio, when is Chio in the morning doing this bit?  Uh, Friday.  I don't know what time they go on.  Six to nine or...  Well, let's see if Chio will take some phone calls from our pests.  There you go.  And acknowledge where he got the idea from.  Let's see if that's...  I believe it was Opie and Anthony.  Let's see if that's possible.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, guys.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  Jeez.  That's great.  A little problem in the air with a guy trying to open the door on a United flight from L.A. to Washington.  What was the problem?  Did they beat him to death as they should have?  A man wearing military fatigues...  That's good.  ...and throwing punches into the air.  Tried to open the exit door of a jet during a cross-country flight on Tuesday night.  Is Master Poe here today?  Where's Poe?  Oh, he is here.  No, I don't need him.  Jesus.  Lock that door.  The man had been acting strangely for about 20 minutes and sat up, wrapped belts around 
[02:44:00]  his hands, threw punches into the air, and then the passengers started hearing the flight  attendant yell for help and tell the man, sir, get your hand off the handle.  He started trying to open the door.  And here's where, pre and post 9-11, this is what happened.  The man was held down and punched by other passengers.  Good.  Yeah, passengers are not going to wait around to see if someone... 
[02:44:30]  You are not going to wait anymore.  They're not going to wait around to see if the stewardesses...  Hey, do they need help?  Is he really trying to open the door?  Maybe I should just sit here.  Yeah, they're not going to wait to see what they do.  Get up, punch him in the face a few times.  That's right.  So I guess they subdued him enough where they didn't even have to land the plane.  Well, they landed the plane.  I mean, emergency land somewhere or somewhere else.  They went on to their scheduled destination.  Wow, that's great, though.  138 passengers on board, six crew, and they pummeled the guy. 
[02:45:00]  And an air marshal was on board also and took the guy into custody.  Well, you actually do hear about a lot of air marshals.  Like, I've never seen one, obviously, to my knowledge, but I guess they really are on flights.  Why do I have to say that?  I just added fucking...  My mouth opened and sound came out of it and nothing was contributed.  But you were terrific five minutes ago.  I sucked just now, though.  You know what I was?  You were weighing something on a scale, and I took a handful of air, and I dropped it on and said, 
[02:45:30]  How's that?  But, Jimmy, it's like hitting three home runs, and you strike out the fourth at bat.  No, it's not.  No one's going to remember the strikeout.  They're going to remember that you had three home runs.  But that wasn't even a strikeout.  That was while the...  That was...  I got up to the plate in between innings while the fucking...  While the commercials are on, and the one team is coming into the dugout,  and the other team is running out.  I'm standing at the plate.  You were standing at the plate.  It was utter irrelevancy.  You know, I was on a flight one time, and there may have been a marshal.  Well, there may not have been.  Go ahead.  Back to you.  Fucking zilch. 
[02:46:00]  Someone gave out the wrong dates for your Denver gig.  Of course they did.  Son of a...  We had problems with that.  Chad!  Chad!  What the fuck's the problem with the comedy works?  Just find the date and fix it.  Everyone's getting confused.  Fix it.  Is it this date?  Are you double booked with that date?  Get the date straight.  Fix it.  Fix it.  Chad?  I'm yelling at...  Hey, boys.  I don't know.  Make it fast.  How's it going?  Make it fast.  Hey, little Jimmy's actually here October 26th, 7th,  and 8th at Comedy Works in Denver.  A boo-boo-boo.  Oh, all right.  All right.  That's all right. 
[02:46:30]  That's fixed.  All right.  I don't know what the a boo-boo-boo is.  I'm at SUNY Dumbly this week.  It's all I care about.  I have no idea what he's talking about.  Okay, listen.  When we get back, this is just terrific.  Let's not forget, two days ago, it was the fifth anniversary of 9-11.  It was?  It was just nothing but sadness on the news and a somber mood and the whores.  They had to have their hair back and they had to have dark clothes on.  A mere two days later, Fox 5's Mark Giuliella tries to get somebody to bark on the streets 
[02:47:00]  of New York City.  Is that it?  We'll do that next.  We got the live F-bomb during the Yankees game.  We got Michael Irvin being called a re-turd and Car Thief says his job is taking white  people's cars.  Oh, great.  So we got lots of radio still to do today.  So you just stay where you are.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft. 
[02:47:30]  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of air.  Quite a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The Obi-Wan Anthony Show.  The nipple outwind now.  In case you don't know.  The nipple outwind now. 
[02:48:00]  We didn't do Operation Kaboom yet either.  What do you want to do, Anthony?  We got some choices here for everybody.  I was drinking my smoothie.  What are the choices, honey?  Well, we got Operation Kaboom.  Kaboom.  We have Michael Irvin. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  I want to see the up-bomb on the Carson Yankees game.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you want that?  Yeah.  That's a quickie.  And then we got, then what do you want to do after that?  Yes.  We can do Kaboom or Mark Joiella tries to get somebody to bark on the street.  Or Car Thief says his job is taking white people's cars.  Oh, I hear that.  All right.  We'll start with the live F-bomb on the Yankee game.  Now, who dropped this?  Not realizing that he's on live TV.  Oh, boy. 
[02:49:00]  It's always...  Curveballer Burt Blylevin drops a couple of F-bombs during a Yankees-Twins game.  Did they acknowledge it?  The beauty of XM Satellite Radio.  Here it is right here.  We all know that the Minnesota Twins have had trouble here in New York.  Well, it's continued here on Friday night because Alex Rodriguez, who had been slumping a little bit,  1-for-21, having a very good series so far, 3-for-8 on Friday night,  a two-run home run, two home runs for Rodriguez, 
[02:49:30]  and then the American League batting title.  Joe Maurer, 2-for-5 so far in the series against Jeter.  We're going to do this fucking thing over again because I just fucked it up.  But we're live.  And Torrey Hunter has been huge for Minnesota.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, he must have just went, like, all hot and red.  But you hear these two phonies.  First of all, Burt Blylevin's voice is fucking radio one-on-one, 
[02:50:00]  and I'm going to mush my yogurt in his face.  And you see that other jacket.  Ah, Torrey Hunter.  Ah.  Bah.  How about some fucking honesty?  Yeah, why don't you say that for, you idiot?  No honesty.  Bah, Torrey Hunter.  Bah.  It didn't happen.  Bah.  Bah.  Can we just hear the end part at least?  Because I've got to hear him go, oh, we're live.  Because I felt all hot for him.  We all know that the Minnesota Twins have had trouble here in New York.  Well, it's continued here on Friday night because Alex Rodriguez, 
[02:50:30]  who had been slumping a little bit, 1-for-21,  having a very good series so far, 3-for-8 on Friday night,  a two-run home run, two home runs for Rodriguez,  and then the American League batting title.  Joe Maurer, 2-for-5 so far in the series against Jeter.  I'm sure we're going to do this fucking thing over again because I just fucked it up.  Well, we're live.  I didn't know that.  And Torrey Hunter has been huge for Minnesota. 
[02:51:00]  Ah, yeah, he just jumps in.  Ah, let me run block.  Holy shit.  I don't want to lose my job.  I don't want to acknowledge that I'm part of this.  You could tell he was all fucked up.  He couldn't get it right.  Right.  And you've been in that situation.  You're in production or something.  You're like, ah, fuck.  Oh, and he just blurts out.  I'm doing a fucking thing over.  I fucked it up.  Oh, we're live.  Oh, he caught it.  Oh, he caught it.  Oh, hey, bloody, uh, baby's a jabby. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty good.  We like that.  Mmm.  Okay.  Ah.  Mmm.  What about the car thief guy?  You want to go there?  I don't know.  All right.  I'm just drinking my smoothie.  Who calls Michael Irvin a retard?  Because maybe we could wrap up the TV things and segue.  Here's how that will segue nicely.  This is why I'm a radio guy.  Mm-hmm.  We have TV.  We're going to go now to TV and black. 
[02:52:00]  And then from black, we do car thief.  Because he's going to steal from white people.  Whoa.  See how that segues?  I was just going to do the Michael Irvin.  Because then it's like our sports wrap up.  Here's all the stuff that's happening in sports today.  No, because for them, stealing cars is also a sport.  Not recognized by the Olympic Committee, but it is a sport.  Mmm.  All right.  Boo. 
[02:52:30]  Boo.  Sorry, the intern.  I didn't even see him come in.  You didn't see him?  No.  That's how he works.  He's wearing a hat so we don't notice that he's a ghoul.  I know.  Is that what he's doing with the hat, you think?  Yeah.  He's wearing like a hat.  Yes.  He prefers a cape.  All right.  Here's Michael Irving.  Michael Irving.  Oh, yeah.  Michael Irving.  He's not Jewish.  Michael Irving?  Oy.  Michael Irving.  He's a good boy.  Michael Irving.  Peyton or Eli? 
[02:53:00]  You know, we've seen it all.  We've seen the ad with the brothers doing that.  We did the tour of the hall right outside the bed.  Who is this game more important to?  Oh.  Oh, it's not even close, Boo.  It's so, so much more important to Eli when you think about all the things that Eli have  gone through.  Think about this.  Whose tongue is too big for their mouth?  Wow.  Wow.  Were you wow?  I don't know.  What happened to his voice?  He never sounded like that.  He didn't?  Not like that.  No, you idiot. 
[02:53:30]  I said bat, not hat.  Oh, what a creepy, big-eared vampire he is.  What is he, delivering newspapers in the 40s?  What's up with that hat?  Extra, extra.  He's all about it.  Boo.  All right, man.  That fucking hat bugs me.  That really does.  If you want to get him in here, just tell him Van Helsing's on the phone.  Where's the dental implant maker? 
[02:54:00]  Let's go to Jason and Rye.  Jason?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I know you were just ripping on that guy for dropping the F-bomb.  Yeah.  I wanted to let you hear a little of this.  That's what's cool about me, though.  Like, I'm half really crazy, or I'm made up of someone that's pretty whacked.  Yeah.  And the other half, my dad is as normal as he can be.  Yeah.  So that's why I'm, like, kind of normal.  Then every once in a while, I fucking curse.  How many years have you been doing this, Skippy? 
[02:54:30]  Sounds good, eh?  I remember that.  How long ago was that?  That was from AF.  I cursed.  AF.  No dump.  No dump.  No dump.  No dump.  And, yeah.  Hey, Skippy.  No dump, and you drop the F-bomb.  Just boom, right out of there.  I remember that day.  Oh, God.  Please.  We did that a bunch of times.  On purpose, too.  Yeah, there was one time I just, I couldn't care less.  I just went off, and I said, uh, motherfucker or something, and then I said, that's right, 
[02:55:00]  I just called you a motherfucker, because I knew it was too late anyway.  Yeah.  So I reiterate.  That's right.  I said it on the air.  Motherfucker.  I bet as soon as we went back into music, I'm like, are we going to get fired?  You mean this one?  Hang on.  Oh, wait.  What do you got?  Yeah, I got it.  Hang on.  Sure, go up.  I can't believe this guy's crazy.  All right.  Do your show, pal.  You have no fucking time.  Yeah, and I said the F word on the air, because this is personal now, you ass. 
[02:55:30]  Like that?  Yeah.  That was one of them.  That was one of many.  No dump.  Live.  That was when we were flying under the radar, sir.  Wrong with you.  I also found your, uh, your first discussion of, uh, Kim Fook, as you call her now.  She's, uh, Kim Fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Amazing.  Yeah, we were able to say fuck, like, a hundred times on our show one day.  God, you have a part of that?  Uh, yeah.  I got it.  Jesus. 
[02:56:00]  Right.  Are you stalking us?  Here.  All right.  Uh, maybe if it wants to work.  All right.  Fook the gook.  Hello, Pete.  Yes, Anthony.  Remember, uh, you always refer to the, uh, little girl.  There we go.  Running, uh, on the streets of, uh, Vietnam.  Remember that picture?  Uh, one of the most famous pictures ever.  Nine-year-old Vietnamese girl severely burned by napalm.  Runs down, uh, a village road. 
[02:56:30]  Well, she's putting a book out.  She's got a little book out, O.P.  Everyone's putting a book out.  You're putting a book out.  No, Anthony, why are you bringing this up?  Yeah, why?  Why?  What, what, what?  Well, it's her name.  Her name.  Her name.  But she had one of those wacky names.  She's got a wacky name.  And I want John to lay off the button.  I want John the dumb guy to lay off the button.  Oh, this one said N.E.W.  N.E.W. 
[02:57:00]  A name all out of the page.  Let me see the name.  All right, Opie.  Look right in the box here.  And you can see what her name is.  Okay.  Uh.  Whoa, really?  There you go.  How the hell did you say that over there?  Look, that's, it's her name.  Maybe you should spell the last name before you say it, just to make sure we're safe.  I don't understand how you wouldn't be able to say the girl's name.  It's in USA today. 
[02:57:30]  Okay.  She's got a book out.  She's the one that ran down the street screaming naked.  She says it's spelled first.  Spell it first.  Spell it first.  Well, Kim.  Kim.  K-I-M.  Okay.  Her last name is spelled P-H-U-C.  All right, kids.  Hold on your hats.  That would make her name Kim Funk. 
[02:58:00]  We got away with this?  Indeed you did.  Holy shit.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I got the rest of it.  No, it's all right.  I know the bit goes off forever.  Make her name.  Yeah, we're just talking about it.  Because I know that, uh.  Kim Funk walking down the street.  Yeah, I know Anthony went into like a whole Richard Nixon thing.  Wow.  All that.  I remember that bit.  That was a really good one.  I'm sure you can find it on OAVirus.com.  Unbelievable.  Great job, dude.  See, people listen on XM like, yes, oh, you're cursed.  No, that was on like regular radio.  That was on regular radio.  Holy shit. 
[02:58:30]  All right, Jason.  We do that.  Thank you, Jason.  Thanks, man.  No problem.  All right, let's go back to the Michael Irvin clip.  I backed up a little bit because his voice sounds really weird.  I don't remember him sounding like this.  Anyone got a cross?  Yeah.  There he goes.  He can only come in the studio if he's invited in.  How would he know?  He might be here right now.  Oh, boo, no.  You have to invite a vampire in.  Hey, get some garlic if we don't want him in here.  Some cloves. 
[02:59:00]  Put him on the fucking around the door.  Why don't they come in and just stand against the wall?  Someone has a really good question for us.  Yes, Doug in Arkansas.  Yeah, did you guys have a music bed under you?  Yes, back in the day we did.  At AF we did.  We didn't at any W, but we were coming back from a break, I guess.  Oh, can we get Steven here for one second?  I hate the fucking music beds.  They're awful.  I want to ask Steve a question. 
[02:59:30]  I hate a music bed.  They used to be good.  I like when we come in from commercial and there's music playing.  But I just, I hate talking over it.  It's awful.  Like when you come back and you're like, hey, we're back.  And then you're talking and the music is still playing.  I fucking want to, I want to.  We could fade that out.  That's easy.  That's an easy fix.  Where's Steve?  I want Steve in here.  He's coming.  All right, wait.  Let's get to Michael Irvin thing.  All right, here.  Steve.  All right.  Ah.  Hello, Steve.  Hello. 
[03:00:00]  Hi.  Hi.  That's why I wanted him to wait.  I knew the energy would be sucked out of the room.  But what do I know?  I have a question.  Since I was 18.  Yeah?  I have a question.  What?  Music beds on the replays.  Like when we're doing this, why are we hearing them?  People who are listening say that there's some music beds under the actual replay, like the  older stuff.  Why? 
[03:00:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  They've been there for...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  For ages.  They've been there for ages.  Why?  You guys don't...  I've heard that you guys don't want them on there now.  They're awful.  All right.  Under what?  Under when we were...  Hold on.  Oh, go ahead.  Why would I talk?  Yeah, exactly.  Why would you talk?  I'm only the guy that does the production.  So I'll just finish.  Get the fuck out now.  He's actually right.  When he said, why should I talk?  I'm only the guy that does the production.  That wasn't sarcastic. 
[03:01:00]  That was accurate.  Yeah, I know.  So now...  The problem is...  Exactly.  Let's hear what's going on.  Yeah, you explain it.  All right.  Those virus promos were done originally with, you know, to sound like fully produced pieces  to differentiate them from exactly what was going on the air on the replay.  So we put beds under them and made them sound like fully produced bits.  Well, we're in commercial on...  But he doesn't give a shit about that.  No, I don't care about that.  No, no, but I do.  He cares about live programming and having music under them. 
[03:01:30]  But I'm saying that people complain.  Which I didn't know, because we could just fade that out.  That's easy.  The listeners were complaining that on the...  Like, we're in commercial, and here on XM, they're hearing some old bits, which is  great.  They're catching up on the show.  A lot of new fans.  Yeah.  They're saying that on some of them, there's actual music bits.  Oh, no.  Right?  On some best-of shit that we're playing?  No.  No.  No.  They would be the long-form promos.  That's all.  No, he's talking about anything that's like two minutes or like three minutes.  I heard a two-minute bed.  Yeah.  That's for the long-form promos.  Like, long-form promos that are two or three minutes.  Yeah, you'll hear like a drum beat under them.  If you want me to get rid of those, I can get rid of those. 
[03:02:00]  Why was it like...  It was like...  Yeah, those are long-form promos.  When we're actually playing bits, there's nothing under them.  Sometimes they're hard to hear.  How about just a short promo?  Like, I can see if it's ten seconds, you know.  But why would you have a beat for two minutes under a bed?  To separate it from, you know, like, an actual block of programming that  was like ten or fifteen minutes.  I mean, if you want me to get rid of them, I can get rid of them.  Yeah, Mark has a problem with it.  Mark, yes, go.  Those fucking cymbals and drums are so fucking loud,  you can't understand the fucking words of the promo, even though I know it.  I've heard that at my house. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, where you listen, and it's like, what?  I can't even hear what I'm talking about.  You know why the process?  There's not much processing on satellite radio.  There's not a whole lot of processing on XM radio.  It's any.  So it squashes.  It doesn't get to smooth everything out nicely.  No, that's actually very right.  That's very correct.  See?  I know what I'm talking about.  I'm smart.  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I synced up so and no.  The quick fix is to just remove them.  Yes. 
[03:03:00]  Are you mad when I walk in the studio?  Steve Hayes, when I walk in the studio, he just wants me to fucking leave.  Yeah.  When I walk in, I have some suggestions.  Get the fuck out now.  All right, why don't we move on to some radio?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I say yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I say yes.  Why not?  Anyway.  We're agreeable.  We want to play the Michael Irving clip.  Yes.  Play the Michael Irving clip.  It makes Steve mad.  It does.  Grr. 
[03:03:30]  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Get out.  Can you get some new sounds?  Get the fuck out.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  When are you going to be acting again?  Why not?  Again.  How about for the first time?  How'd your parents die?  You guys didn't catch it.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Do you understand?  If we came in at seven and you did that until 11, I would be happy.  Of course.  That is anti-acting. 
[03:04:00]  I'm aware of that.  It is the complete...  If that and acting met, the universe would disappear.  If that plus acting equals zero.  I actually did one.  I actually did a wow promo that Danny and I wrote that played this morning that features...  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That's terrible. 
[03:04:30]  I'm sorry.  Fucking creeps.  No, no.  I want to hear him take charge.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Are you picturing his stupid eyes half squinting as he turns?  No, no, no.  I'm being...  Hey, you're fantastic.  There's a new acting clip?  You have a new acting clip?  There's a new Steve acting clip?  We made three new...  The guys made two new wow promos.  Danny and I made one.  And then this one I put on a phony accent. 
[03:05:00]  Ew.  All right.  We'll get that.  Get that for the next break.  Please.  I got to get the Michael Irvin thing in here.  So Michael Irvin was called a retard.  Who cares?  Michael Irvin.  Yeah, but it's the football guys.  They're just...  They're always trashing each other and fucking with each other.  Yeah.  Peyton or Eli?  You know, we've seen it all.  We've seen the ad with the brothers doing that.  We did the tour of the hall right outside the bed.  Who is this game more important to?  Oh. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, it's not even close, boom.  And it's so, so much more important to Eli when you think about all the things that Eli  have gone through.  Think about this guy, how he got to New York in the draft and all the hoopla that was put  around the draft.  The way last year, when he started out early and then faded in the end, they lost in the  playoffs.  All of this stuff.  Eli is still in his maturation process.  If he wins this game Sunday night, it says, I have matured.  I am here.  I am amongst the elite quarterbacks in this league. 
[03:06:00]  And in New York City, that's a huge statement to make.  Are you retarded?  Hey, look.  Who cares?  What was that?  Is that a real big story today?  Why is that a problem?  Are you retarded?  Retards love football.  They wear the same helmets.  That can't be a problem.  Try to find some...  It probably is.  Try to find the backstory on that.  Some guy probably called in and go, my son is Down syndrome. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  We were watching this and he heard that.  And he just continued eating the pillow he had been eating before we turned it on.  Do you know the backstory on the retarded clip there, Dan?  Not the complete backstory, but it was a pretty popular YouTube clip this morning.  So I figured I pulled it.  Maybe it was just...  All right.  Are you retarded?  Yeah.  All right.  There's nothing to that.  It sounded retarded.  We're okay with that.  We like using the word retard.  I don't think we should use it anymore.  In the proper context.  Yes.  Mentally challenged retard. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  We'll break the car thief story for Anthony.  That's what I want to hear.  And we got to do kaboom before we get out of here.  Kaboom.  And we got to do...  Kaboom.  Mark Joyella tries to get somebody to bark on the street.  I guess that is a tie-in to the Barbara Walters thing we were talking about earlier today.  The talking dog story.  So they went out and tried to get a bit of bark.  And stupid has an acting clip that we have to get to.  Yeah.  And we'll do that after the break.  An accent.  During the first half of the show, I wanted to play She's Got a Smile.  We were talking about fatties and stuff.  And it was brought to my attention. 
[03:07:30]  There was a few bleeps.  So we wanted to play this earlier.  So listen to this as we go to break.  And by the way, your promo idea is brilliant for a contest.  You fucking don't lose X amount of weight.  Your husband is the bag.  Oh, yeah.  We have to do something with that.  That's great.  I don't know if there's anybody willing to do it, though.  Guaranteed.  Some woman who thinks she can lose a few pounds.  We can't do 50.  That's impossible.  No, we'll have to figure out maybe a pound a day for a month.  We'll provide, get a gym to sponsor it, a personal trainer to sponsor it.  If you're willing to work hard, you know, that's great, dude.  Got to make, you know what? 
[03:08:00]  Got to make it a little more attractive.  Well, if she does it.  Because a woman, money.  Yeah, if she does it, she gets $10,000 or whatever it would be.  Yeah, we make a huge cash prize.  But she's got to fess up to the fact that if she doesn't lose the weight,  the husband gets to have sex with the stripper.  Bang a hooker or what?  What are we going to do?  Can't do a hooker.  It's illegal.  But let's just say.  It's a freebie.  That's right.  This is a way to get this done.  Absolutely a way to get it done.  So you think we're going to find a couple that's willing to do this?  I absolutely think we will. 
[03:08:30]  An unhappy couple or a woman that, like, thinks she can do it.  I can do it.  Good.  You can promise them $500,000.  It doesn't matter because I'm going to do it.  So the woman has to.  What about a pound a day?  I don't know enough about weight loss.  Like a physical fitness person would.  That's probably too crazy too, right?  Yeah, it's got to be something that they can do.  What can you do on the fat smash?  How about a mic?  You lost what?  It's got to be realistic, but really hard.  Stan just looked at me.  If you saw the look that fucking Stan gave me, he really wants to punch my teeth right 
[03:09:00]  now because I scolded him.  Yeah, we can't hear you, Stan.  No.  Louder.  You can't hear me.  That's good.  I just personally lost 23 pounds.  Very proud of you.  In nine days.  But I think that's pretty.  Wait, wait.  23 pounds?  Yeah.  In nine days.  Yeah.  It was.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Get your leg cut off.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  But that's, I don't think.  What did you eat, meat that you found?  So what do we do?  30 pounds?  Results may vary. 
[03:09:30]  We could call Dr. Ian Smith and figure it out.  Why not?  All right.  Oh, God.  Hold on a minute.  Chris in New Hampshire.  Chris?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Talk.  You're on the air, sir.  Do you really want to know what's going on?  Or was that just like, hey, what's going on?  That's kind of a just greeting.  It's just, hey, what's going on?  Okay.  What's going on?  I'm talking about the retard thing.  It's so stupid.  I have a daughter with Down syndrome.  Aw.  And, you know, my wife gets upset when she hears people say retard. 
[03:10:00]  And we used to sit around the living room and make fun of window lickers and just make  jokes about retard, you know?  Aw, boy.  Now that we have a daughter with Down syndrome, it's like she's a totally different person.  And she actually gets mad at me.  She goes, I can't believe you listen to those guys.  They have that thing about number one with kids with Down syndrome.  And I go, you know what?  I go, you're such a hypocrite because we used to do the same stuff before she was born.  You used to make fun and then all of a sudden...  Oh, of course.  My father-in-law drives the little bus and, you know, we used to make fun of the kids on 
[03:10:30]  his bus and, you know, in the winter did it kind of get stuck to the window and...  Karma's a bitch, man.  I was like, oh, can't say that anymore.  How old is your daughter?  Four.  Okay.  Aw.  That's adorable.  Why don't we play special ed now instead?  You know, you give her a regular haircut?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Good.  That's a good parenting if you have a kid with Down syndrome.  Just give them a normal fucking haircut.  I wonder if they have the short hair for, like, a reason, like, they don't pull it or, yeah, 
[03:11:00]  it doesn't get caught in things.  They don't have short hair?  Why?  No reason for...  No reason for...  They're trying to save money.  They're very sensitive to, like, pain.  Okay.  So when you brush their hair, they scream bloody murder.  So if you keep their hair short, it doesn't get tangled easy.  So it's real easy to comb.  That's why.  Wow.  Hey.  Wow.  Real sensitive to pain?  Hey, Chris.  You're very sensitive to anything.  I don't like the pain they cause others.  Chris.  Hey, Chris. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  What are you going to do with it eventually?  Stop it.  Her.  Opie.  Oh.  Somebody...  You know, they've made leaps and bounds in research and education and longevity.  My daughter, I'm sure I'll get a laugh or whatever, but she's very high-functioning.  Let me ask you a question.  Obviously, you love your daughter as much as any parent loves any other kid, but when  you...  Now, when did you find out...  They did research for longevity?  She is down syndrome.  How did you find out? 
[03:12:00]  Sorry, sorry.  That's right.  How did you find out?  Not until after she was born.  Oh, they didn't know beforehand.  And what was your, like, feelings?  Were you, like, angry or depressed or, like...  Well, my wife was.  I was actually happy.  I've been around a lot of kids with down syndrome and stuff, so I had no problem with it whatsoever.  I thought it was pretty cool.  So, my wife was not.  She was disappointed, which is...  That's odd.  Which is kind of weird because my wife's a special ed teacher, so it's kind of strange  that she was bummed out about it.  Or pretty common that she would because she sees, like, how difficult it is. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  Do you guys blame each other in a weird way?  Either one of you have other kids?  Do you have kids?  Yeah, we have an older...  We have a seven-year-old daughter.  And she's fine, right?  Yep.  Yep.  Didn't you do one of those tests?  No.  No.  No.  That's silly.  They do those tests.  What do they do?  Take...  What is it?  Amnio?  What's that?  Yeah, amniocentesis.  And then they take out and then they're able to tell if the baby's okay or not.  And if not, start getting the old hanger out. 
[03:13:00]  You can tell if you're going to have a bobblehead.  And just end that and start over.  But, hey, it sounds like, you know, you're okay with it.  Yeah, God bless.  Oh, yeah, I'm cool with it.  I will tell you one thing, for Jimmy's sake, I've taught her to say Yankees suck.  That's fine.  And she does that very well.  That's good, just like the rest of them.  Yeah, teach her to say...  Teach her to say, it is high, it is far.  I have a job for her.  Watch her hair cut and don't let her get all fat. 
[03:13:30]  For some reason, they figure, let them eat whatever they want.  They let them get fat because they don't know how to tell people, no, you can't fuck me.  They figure, make them unattractive.  I'm sorry, you keep talking while I'm going for the joke.  Granted, you have the experience, but, you know, I was trying to put a little funny into the show, but go right ahead.  No, no, I'm sorry, sir.  Let's just keep it serious the whole morning.  All right, now you can just keep talking while Oprah's talking.  I guess we know who the problem in this DNA mix was. 
[03:14:00]  Jesus.  I guess we know the answer to that question, yes.  All right, thanks for calling, man.  Thanks for calling.  We do appreciate it, buddy.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Good luck.  Thank you, man.  I rarely say this.  Thanks for having a sense of humor, Chris.  That's fine with it.  All right.  Let's go to T-Bone in Florida.  T-Bone.  I got a candidate for line of the day when Jimmy said, I can't even say it without laughing.  Jesus.  Three times football, they wear the same helmet. 
[03:14:30]  Hey.  That was brilliant, but I'm sticking up for my pal Anthony.  Let's not forget Anthony's line from three hours ago.  Oh, well.  See, they forget Anthony.  How soon.  My best line of the day came on 92.3, and Ant's line was better.  I don't like to admit it.  My best line of the day, I felt, was when Barbara talks to her dog.  The dog talks to Barbara.  Hold on, sir.  I'm reiterating.  When the dog talks to Barbara, and I said, what does he say?  This stinks.  Could you put more peanut butter on it?  That was a damn good line because it was on 3FM. 
[03:15:00]  It really was.  Ant's line about, he changed her diaper, and then they adopted what was in it.  It's not only, it's calling basic.  Oh, go ahead, sir.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to actually just continue a thought.  You just go ahead and write in there, interject, and fucking be accurate in your play.  We'll shut his mouth.  I forgot.  Star is talking.  I forgot in the script there, there's parentheses where it just goes, stop talking, and your  lines come in.  Hey, guys.  Did I have a good line today?  Oh, Christ. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, you did.  I did?  Mm-hmm.  No, I didn't.  You did, actually.  I could tell by your face.  I didn't have any good.  No, I'm only worried you're going to ask me to name it because I don't remember it.  You did.  All right.  Where are we?  I will have it, but it's funny.  Ah, yes.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Oh, man.  I just came up with ideas today.  That's all I did.  Well.  I'm thinking I might have had a line today, though.  You did have a line.  Jeff, what's up?  Actually, you had a really good line this morning.  Hold on, Jeff.  I don't know.  Am I fucking, I feel like Swayze in Ghost.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[03:16:00]  That's brilliant. 
[03:16:30]  What the fuck was your line?  It's going to annoy me now.  It's all right.  You got a huge laugh from me.  That's all right.  I know, but I want to know.  Now it's going to annoy me.  My city's going to be annoyed.  Hey, believe it or not, people want in on this contest.  Jeff in Jersey.  Yeah, my wife just had a baby.  She's about two bills.  And, you know, she could drop a couple pounds.  She was talking about doing, you know, a weight loss thing.  And this would be a good inspiration for her.  And, you know, hopefully she doesn't do it and I get to bang a hottie.  Yeah, but did your wife agree to that part of the contest?  Well, I think I could talk her into it. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, well, I got to talk her into it.  Yeah, she's agreeing.  She would do it because she went to lose the weight.  So she would, you know, you throw some money at her, she would do it in two seconds.  See, the guys aren't going to be the problem.  They're going to sign up for this contest like crazy.  We got to get the women that want in on this contest.  See, I could get her to do it.  All right.  You throw enough money at a woman, it's easy.  Why don't you three-way us?  You call her, get her on the show and we'll talk it over.  All right, I'll call her and I'll call you guys back.  All right.  This is pathetic. 
[03:17:30]  Rob in White Plains, go real fast.  Hello, shit dicks.  Hi.  Oh, if you had a really good line today, I laughed my ass off.  I just can't remember what it was.  Oh, that's the sign of a great line.  No, but I remember the reaction.  Boy, while we're talking about Anthony's great line, I mean, not only did we remember it,  we remembered it word for word.  And in context.  But I had a great line and they don't remember what it was.  Holy shit.  Does someone have the line?  I stink.  That's not true.  It's just we can't remember the line.  I'm just going to freaking be nothing. 
[03:18:00]  You actually...  Nothing.  No.  If you have a great line and you say on any given moment, what was my good line today?  And somebody immediately fires out the line, that means it was an isolated incident.  I just don't remember.  I just remember the reaction again.  I was just joking.  Lori, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Better now that you called.  Hey, I'm considering the husband banging a stripper for losing weight.  Oh, nice.  How big a disaster are you?  How what?  How heavy a gal are you?  I'm about 198 pounds.  I just had a baby three months ago. 
[03:18:30]  God love you.  A baby what?  How tall a pig are you?  How tall?  I'm 5'5".  5'5".  I'm a little chunky.  I thought that was bad though.  What did you used to weigh before the kid?  You made of lead?  No.  I probably weighed about 160 before the kid.  160 before?  Yeah.  You think you're going to...  I'm a sports girl.  I mean, I'm...  You're a sports girl?  Sports girl.  Yeah.  What do you play?  What do you play?  What are you, a Russian weightlifter?  The Astrodome? 
[03:19:00]  No, I do play volleyball and I do go to...  With who?  Christopher Reeve?  Rick Allen?  That was my try for line of the day, by the way.  Okay.  I almost had one.  I know I'm a chunky girl.  That's all right.  No, no, but you're a sports girl.  You were 160 and 5'5".  What sports did you play?  Volleyball.  Oh, okay.  Volleyball.  Were you also a lineman for the Cowboys?  I thought about it.  Tried out for it, but you know.  All right.  I'm just teasing.  Hey, yeah.  She first got into volleyball when she got caught in the net.  Well, I left a message for my husband. 
[03:19:30]  Shut up and let me laugh.  That's your problem.  Your mouth doesn't stay closed for long.  By the way, thank you, Chester's Liver from Whack Bag.  Oh.  I will submit this line as my line of the day.  Okay.  All right.  Is it really underage sex if they can't feel it?  Thank you.  That wasn't the line, though.  That was not...  I like that one.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Because the young chick was banging black guys. 
[03:20:00]  The line I'm thinking of is true.  And then this other guy wanted to have sex with the underage girl.  With the 16-year-old.  Right.  I want to make that into a t-shirt.  Call up Brother Elmo.  All right.  Back to Lori.  So, Lori, can you lose 25 pounds in a month?  Absolutely.  All right.  Here's the deal.  You lose 25...  Is that hard?  I don't know.  I don't think that's hard enough.  Let's get Dr. Ian Smith on the phone.  We need something that's hard to do because it's got to be a challenge.  It is hard to do.  So, really what you should lose to do it the right way is about two pounds a week. 
[03:20:30]  So, that's what?  Eight pounds a month.  So, yeah.  That would be hard.  Do you eat a lot?  Do you eat poorly?  Be honest.  No.  I like potato chips.  Okay.  So, that would be a yes in the poorly category.  That's bad.  When do you eat them?  When I get home from work and after the two kids go to bed.  You eat them chips right before bed?  Do you wipe your greasy chip fingers on the comforter and just doze off with a mouthful  of half-chewed chips?  Waves up with crumb ass. 
[03:21:00]  I wipe it on the couch and I doze off.  Oh, wow.  Was your husband slender?  No, he's not slender.  Hmm.  She plays volleyball by dodging fishing nets.  Yes.  Chester's liver.  Yeah, that was kind of an answer line.  An answer line, yes.  Art from Boston being very hurtful.  Opie's good line today was how often he interrupted Stuart Copeland.  No, go ahead, sir.  You explain to the police.  I was there and rode the rocket to the top while you were DJing for $7 an hour.  You tell the story.  Jesus.  You ass.  Art hates me today. 
[03:21:30]  I was very excited to talk to Stuart Copeland and when he was doing that Throgs thing,  it reminded me of my DJing nightmare.  I wasn't trying to tell his story.  I was just trying to have a conversation with him.  I wouldn't try to one-up him.  Hey, what happened to her?  She couldn't wait for me to just go off on a little tangent?  What, she left?  She probably ate the phone.  Wow.  25 pounds in a month is nothing. 
[03:22:00]  All right, hold on a minute.  Stephanie.  Stephanie in Jersey, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  Well, I'm interested in doing the contest, if possible.  You are.  Yeah, absolutely.  I already talked to my fiance.  All right.  How much do you weigh?  All right.  I quit smoking about 10 months ago.  Uh-oh.  And I've gained about, I would say about 70 pounds.  In a month?  From smoking?  No, no, 10 months.  About, yeah.  I'm sorry.  In a year, you put on 70 pounds.  I quit smoking, too.  I put on some weight over the course of a couple of years. 
[03:22:30]  You put on 70 pounds in 10 months?  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is.  I smoke weed, too.  Oh, my God.  So, how much do you weigh now?  Uh, 199.  You're 200 pounds.  Yeah, let's call it.  Lady, don't, don't.  Yeah, I'm about 5'6".  Let's call it 210.  Let's be honest with each other.  No, no.  Absolutely.  199.  I believe we're 5'6", 199, and you were 5'6", 129?  Yeah.  Does that pound give you peace of mind?  No.  Like, you're really, like, no, no, 199.  Like, I'm not 200 pounds. 
[03:23:00]  No, I'm not.  You're a 200-pound woman.  No, no, it's really 199.  No, no, no.  Regardless, if you were 195, you're a 200-pound woman.  Okay.  Let's say 200.  Like, yeah, you can't just say 199 and think that's going to help.  And make you think you're not 200 pounds.  Let's be realistic.  Well, you know, it could be 198.  So, just rounding it off.  So, if you want to say 200, I'll be happy to say that.  What if you ate a big meal and got on the scale?  You'd be over 200.  230.  Yeah, I'd probably be like 201. 
[03:23:30]  230.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  230.  By the way, Scoot from Louisiana.  We lost, what was it, Lori?  Yeah.  And we said, what happened to Lori?  Well, Scoot writes.  Oh, thanks, man.  That was perfect.  No one's helping.  Really?  No, I was helping.  What did Scoot write?  You decided at that moment you had to do some internet surfing.  That's great.  Thank you.  Thanks for the help.  I really appreciate it.  Well, hey, here's...  Oh, now Stephanie's going to chime in.  Oh, hold on, Stephanie.  I'll try to reach out.  Well, it'll look like they're in your paycheck. 
[03:24:00]  Why don't we all just talk?  No, it's okay, dude.  Go ahead, Stephanie.  Go ahead, Stephanie.  What did Scoot write, Opie?  No, no, no.  You go ahead.  You go ahead, guys.  Scoot in Louisiana.  I'm just sitting here.  Because we lost Lori, right?  Yeah.  I didn't know where she was gone.  And I said, what happened to Lori?  Yeah.  Scoot writes, she heard the ice cream truck song.  And was gone.  And was gone.  It updated as I was trying to read.  She actually probably ran through the fucking door and screen door, like Herman Munster.  She didn't even open it.  She just ran through it. 
[03:24:30]  Just left her silhouette in the door.  A big, fat silhouette.  Yeah.  It's like you can see, here's the shape.  A big, fat body, a head, the left hand raised in excitement, and the right hand clutching  a purse, because that's where all the ice cream money is, in her fat purse, right by  the door.  Ka-ting, ka-ting, ka-ting, ka-ting, ka-ting, ka-ting.  Crash.  Ka-ting, ka-ting, ka-ting, ka-ting, ting.  That's not the ice cream.  It certainly is.  Ching-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.  Ching-a-ling-a-ling.  Ching-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling. 
[03:25:00]  I don't know.  What is it now?  The Bits Still Kills.  The stupid ice cream man song.  That's the jack of the box.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  I have a pig in a box.  You wind it up and a fucking elephant from the cantina scene pops out.  All right, so where are we?  Stephanie, she weighs about 210.  And she's 5'6".  So you think you could lose 25 to 30 pounds in a month?  Yeah, man.  Well, you know what?  My motivation, too, is I'm getting married next year. 
[03:25:30]  Let's hope.  I really, really am motivated to do this.  And I know I can beat anybody.  Who would you?  Who would you?  Are you about a size 14?  How big?  I love it.  How big is your fiança?  My fiancée.  My fiancée.  Let's see.  He's about like 280, I think.  I've lost my fiancée.  280?  Yeah, but he's like 6'4".  Oh, all right.  Yeah, he would kick our ass.  He wants to do this contest?  Yeah, absolutely.  I called him this morning.  Now, you do understand the consequences.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[03:26:00]  I have no question in my mind.  I have no question in my mind.  All right, whatever you want to say.  I'll just sit here and let you call.  You do understand the consequences.  There was a semicolon after that, not a period.  I was then going to explain to our listeners the consequences.  All right.  That's usually what happens when you say something like that.  Let's start over.  Now that you know how we're playing here, I'll even rewind a little bit.  Me too.  Now, you do know the consequences.  Yes, I do.  If you don't lose the weight, your husband... 
[03:26:30]  Oh, my Jesus.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus, Lord Jesus Christ, and baby Jesus.  Well, no, let her just jump in.  There's no reason for you to explain it when she can jump in with a sound.  But I had already told her that...  And she said yes.  She said yes.  She understood, but just couldn't keep her mouth shut.  She wasn't talking to you.  She actually...  That's because I didn't have a burger.  Oh, my God.  She actually said, not now.  She heard the refrigerator calling her.  And she actually went, not now. 
[03:27:00]  She didn't realize it wasn't a real voice.  Go ahead.  We'll just tease you, sweetheart.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Can't you just stuff your mouth with a Twinkie so we can continue?  Yeah.  Grab whatever food, fattening food is around you right now and just shove it in your face  while I try to explain this again.  Okay.  Sorry, dude.  That's right, baby.  You do understand the consequences to this.  Yes, I do, sir.  Yes.  If you don't lose the weight...  Your husband will get to have sex with a stripper or some other hot girl that we can 
[03:27:30]  dig up somewhere.  And he will do that in front of you.  Yes.  I already talked to him about it.  And he has no doubt in his mind that I will conquer this challenge.  He's going to be at night just forcing Twinkies down your throat and up your ass.  He's going to ID that shit.  Directly up her ass.  He's going to dump out the low-fat stuff and put the real fattening stuff in there.  Like he's going to fucking dump out your yogurt and put like cheesecake in there.  Do you think...  Good reference.  He's going to crazy glue your butt cheeks together while you're sleeping. 
[03:28:00]  No shitting.  Do you honestly think your husband's pulling for you in this whole thing?  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah, because he'd hate to have to fuck a stripper.  I understand.  Dude, that old 199 over here.  We went to go see you guys at PNC.  Oh, thank you.  We really love you guys.  That explains everything.  Jimmy, you were awesome.  Oh, thank you very much.  How did you...  Did you sit on the lawn?  Or did you just go out there when you were hungry?  No, I got money.  I got really good seats.  Sit on the lawn. 
[03:28:30]  Cheap seats and a great meal.  Just raising out there while the comedy's going on.  Listen, listen.  We're getting a little silly now.  If we can do this contest, we'll be considered the greatest radio show ever.  That's right.  Even if we can't.  We need money to give her if she succeeds.  Money, money, money.  We need three couples because we need one couple to fail.  Yeah, absolutely.  We need money, so then the girl will get money if she succeeds.  We need chicks, hot stripper chicks that are willing to have sex with these guys if the women fail. 
[03:29:00]  And it has to be done in a place where she can watch.  And it has to be watched by, like, I don't want to use the word spotter.  That didn't go too well last time.  No, it certainly didn't.  But it has to be watched by somebody that is trustworthy, that can tell us, yes, he is indeed having sex with this woman in front of the wife.  If we can't get money from XM or CBS, I will do at least this much. 
[03:29:30]  For every pound Stephanie loses, I will give her $100.  Nice.  Wait a minute.  20?  How many are you gunning for?  $25 would be $2,500.  $2,500?  This contest is too good.  Too good!  Wow.  But hopefully someone will come forward with cash.  Now I'm supposed to match that because it's the Anthony show?  No.  Instead, I gave my money to the pudding-headed two-year-old kid.  So she could get in her wheelchair. 
[03:30:00]  Every time she sneezes, she sounds like a tub full of Jell-O on an amusement park ride.  We need a sponsor.  Where's Bodog when we need him?  We just need cash for a contest.  We need cash.  Where's Elo?  Yeah, we need cash.  We need cash.  So, Stephanie, hold on a line. 
[03:30:30]  We're going to get your info.  All right.  Hey, I'm a black ninja motherfucker.  Oh.  Yes.  Very good.  The catchphrase is catching on.  It's catching on.  The game's not even out yet.  Oh, what?  What?  Who?  What happened?  Well, I'm boom.  All right.  So you're willing.  That's nice.  Okay.  All right.  Are we going to have her hang on and take info?  Did you already say that while I wasn't listening?  Yeah.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  We got another couple.  We got-  Her Majesty, Travis.  We got Jeff and Jenna. 
[03:31:00]  Get Elo on the phone.  We need him immediately.  Jeff and Jenna.  I'm back, baby.  Yeah.  Where's Jenna?  I'm right here.  Hi, Jenna.  Hi, Jenna.  Hi.  You don't sound thrilled.  He's just crazy.  He's a crazy nut.  He's a crazy nut.  But you do sound fat.  Yeah, you do have the fat throat sound.  Like, I could tell you got a couple of pounds on.  That's okay.  How much do you weigh, young lady?  One-95.  One-95.  Another 200-pounder.  That's good. 
[03:31:30]  And how much does your husband weigh?  Oh.  What are you down to, honey?  One-fifty-something?  All right.  I think one-fifty-five.  Okay.  How tall are you, sweetie?  Five-two.  Eww.  Five-two, 200 pounds.  That's a rough ride.  All right.  And, sir, you're what?  Six-  Six foot.  Five-four.  You're five-four?  Why are you blaming it on two kids?  Yeah, where'd you two meet when you both couldn't get on a ride in Coney Island? 
[03:32:00]  They met at a little people convention.  Oh, my God.  Are you really five-four?  A couple of shrimps.  Oh, my God.  Five-four and a swip-less.  Four kids are midgets, too.  Oh, my God.  You're little people.  We are little people.  Five foot?  Five-four and five-two.  And you're both fat, because I thought, you know, the guy, when he said his weight, I  pictured, you know, six foot, he's probably strapping, but no.  And I just lost, like, 60 pounds, too.  I was five-four, 225. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  All muscle?  Oh, now it is.  Hey, Jenna, how much did you used to weigh?  When I met him or before?  At your thinnest and what you considered your hottest.  Birth weight.  I was one-thirty when we got married.  One-thirty?  Mm-hmm.  You have four children, though, right?  You're five-four.  I have two.  You're five-two, right?  Yeah, she's five-two.  Five-two.  All right.  Jeff, did you explain what's going on to Jenna? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, briefly.  She moves.  You know the consequences if you don't lose the weight.  Yes.  Your husband gets to have sex with a hot stripper, and you watch.  Yep.  You ever seen your husband fuck another broad?  No.  How big a penis does he have?  Average.  Oh, gosh.  She just smacked you in your short little face.  No, that's a compliment, man.  Yeah, it is.  Big is not a compliment.  Average is.  Average.  You have a body like a cartoon bomb. 
[03:33:30]  There it is.  There's Ovi's line.  All right, I'm going to submit that one.  A cartoon bomb.  You guys are making me try hard today.  He shows up.  He has a shirt.  It just says, act me on it.  That's good.  Goddamn, that's funny.  Ziggy will pay $50 per pound lost to all three couples.  That's crap. 
[03:34:00]  That's crap.  No, we'll get the money ahead of time, and we'll put it in escrow.  We're looking for big money.  You know, ideally, $1,000 a pound would be great for a couple.  Yeah, now you're talking.  But we, you know, that would be ideally.  No, she loses fucking 30 pounds.  I mean impossible.  $30,000?  What are you, nuts?  A thousand pounds, too much.  You know.  Yeah.  Pound foolish.  Penny shy.  Did you get a raise I didn't hear about?  I got a million dollar bill right for me.  Oh, I see that.  There's no such thing. 
[03:34:30]  I'm going to be a literal guy from now on.  I'm going to just wreck everything.  They don't exist.  Million dollar bills are phony.  You're exaggerating.  All right, you guys want in on this?  Yes.  Am I saying yes?  You have a month to lose.  We're not really sure of the exact.  We don't know the weight yet.  We're thinking anywhere from 25 to 35 pounds.  Okay.  It keeps getting higher and higher.  I know.  That's right.  We just need to lose 80 pounds.  Well, we're not sure.  We have to check because we want it. 
[03:35:00]  We don't want it to be easy.  You got to work at this.  We want couples to fail miserably.  And then we want to see lots and lots of tears.  And Jeff, what are you complaining about?  You should make us say like 100 pounds in a week.  Yeah.  Ow.  Yeah.  That's too money or a check.  Come on.  What would you rather do?  A stripper or a fuck that hoppity hop you're married to?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I say yes to the midget couple. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, I kind of like them.  They're cute and I haven't even seen them.  Did you just call them McCute?  No, I said they're cute and I haven't even seen them.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Hold on a line, guys.  We'll see how serious you really are.  Hold on.  Talk to Miss Travis.  Okay.  All right.  And finally, we got Denise for today.  Hi, Denise.  Hi, Denise.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  How are you?  I'm good.  I'm in.  How much do you weigh?  Well, I am currently 180.  I have lost 35 pounds since I had my daughter 15 months ago and I cannot make the scale budge. 
[03:36:00]  I'm at the gym.  You know, so I'm thinking this.  I'm really competitive.  It's all diet.  What are you eating?  I probably eat about 1,600 to 1,700 calories a day.  I don't know anything about that.  How many meals?  I would say three normal-sized meals and like a snack in the afternoon of like a granola bar.  Nope.  Dr. Ian Smith tells us it's five to six small meals a day.  Who's got time for that shit? 
[03:36:30]  You should be eating like every three hours.  Who the fuck has time for that?  The problem is you starve yourself during the day and then at night you overeat because you're  really, really hungry.  So if you keep food in your body all day long, you don't eat as much.  She's going to tell you.  And your metabolism is better.  Yeah, Fatty's going to tell me how to lose weight.  Go ahead, Fatty.  Go ahead.  Fatty, that's mean and I didn't say that.  I didn't either.  No.  I know Obie's voice.  I'm not even smiling.  I know obnoxious Obie's voice.  I'm not going to laugh at the likes of that because you sound like a wonderful woman.  That's right.  And you're married, of course. 
[03:37:00]  I am.  Part of this contest is that you have to be married.  Your husband?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Does he know about this?  Have you told him?  I left him a message.  He hasn't called me back yet.  God, they really want in on this.  This is cool.  Now, how tall are you?  5'5".  5'5", 180.  5'5", 180.  All right.  So you're going to have to lose, give or take, 30 pounds in a month.  You know what?  I would love to do it.  I've been trying and this probably would help me, push me over the edge. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, this could motivate you.  By the way, we don't help you.  Don't think there's going to be a doctor involved or a fitness expert.  Nothing.  Exercise coach, personal trainer.  You get to the library and do some reading.  Yeah, do it yourself.  Go to Barnes & Noble.  Put a headband on and jog in place and hum Xanadu for all we care.  Right.  That's fine.  Fucking have a Fudgy the Whale cake for dessert.  Oh, that's awesome.  Now, you do understand that if you fail at this, you get to gaze upon your husband getting 
[03:38:00]  his dick sucked by some stripper and then sticking it in her ass or any place of his choosing.  You know what?  That's the part that scares me.  I don't think he'd be able to do it.  He gets, oh, he'll be able to do it.  Yeah.  He passed out at his bachelor party.  He gets to stick it in her.  He really did.  It's because all the blood rushed out of his head.  You know what?  He passed out.  He can't hold his liquor.  Go ahead, O.  Nah, you taught me something about comedy. 
[03:38:30]  You can't force the line.  Sometimes you can re-say it afterwards, even though you know it's not going to get a laugh.  You can say it almost like with a disclaimer, like, look, I was going to say this, the moment's  gone, but you should still give out the line anyway.  My pal Jimmy's teaching me about comedy.  That's right.  Timing is everything.  That's right.  Rule number one, Down syndrome, a hoot.  Unless, of course, you're...  All right, listen, Denise.  I have one.  Yes.  All right.  We're going to get some info from you.  Hold on, please.  Awesome.  Oh, no.  I laughed inside. 
[03:39:00]  Believe me.  I loved it.  All right.  You know what?  Oh, my dick is hard again.  Oh.  Man, mine was, too, last night.  Oh, what time?  It's a time-life moment.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Jesus.  It wasn't...  Why do you have to stand up, assume the Superman hands-on-hip pose, and actually lay your cock  on the console through your jeans.  You're going to wreck... 
[03:39:30]  You're going to bruise the helmet.  It looks all bent.  It is bent.  Why are you bending it?  What, Steve?  No.  I'm trying to talk to you.  Steve.  Why not?  Steve, Jimmy wants to say...  Jimmy, show our friends outside.  No.  I don't want anybody to see.  The kid from Australia is laughing his ass off.  Why is it all bent?  Because it's too big for my jeans to go straight out, sweetie.  That is hysterical.  It's called a mouthful, kiddo.  All right, listen.  Fucking Jimmy, man.  Let's go to Doug Out Dog.  What is wrong with you? 
[03:40:00]  I don't know.  I've got a hard on.  Doug.  What's going on?  Your number two message board would like to contribute $9.09 per pound loss.  Wait, $9.09.  For any of the girls that contribute.  Ooh.  And as a special bonus, we're going to come up with a nice cash prize for the guy that  has the balls to fuck the hot stripper and then come on the wife.  We have to do this contest.  I know.  I really didn't think couples would go for that.  Come on.  They're going for it.  I threw it out there this morning as kind of a goof. 
[03:40:30]  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  FullblownAids.com.  Absolutely.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We should take a break.  We were going to break like 40 minutes ago.  So what do we need for this contest?  It looks like we've got couples.  We need a stripper.  We need money.  And we need couples willing to do it.  Will blowjobs work?  Yeah.  I know we need strippers.  We may need to get a porn girl.  Yeah.  Might need to get a porn chick.  Because here's the problem you've got to run into. 
[03:41:00]  Will a porn girl blow guys?  Here's the problem you've got to run into.  The legal aspect of prostitution and stuff, the station's going to go crazy.  We can't do it.  So what the porn girl would probably be willing to do for major, massive plugs in a friendly  fashion, have sex, as opposed to-  That could be called fuckola.  Oh, yeah.  But no, no, no.  Because she's coming on.  She's doing something for the show.  Yeah.  No, no.  We're not asking-  It's like-  Oh, the legal department.  It's just going to ruin another one. 
[03:41:30]  No, they won't.  Add this to the list of things we can't do on the show.  No, no, no, no, no.  Will get us a porn star.  The porn star is the easy part.  It's getting this through a legal department.  No, that's simple.  It's a married couple.  It's-  No money is being exchanged.  I thought-  No money is being exchanged.  No, if the woman wins, she gets money.  She gets money.  If she loses, no money is exchanged.  The guy gets to fuck the stripper, whore, porn star, whatever you want to call her. 
[03:42:00]  And no money is exchanged.  It's a consenting couple in a room with another woman having some sex.  Okay.  But the wife can't jump in.  Someone's suggesting we call it sex for ham.  Thank you, Turtle from Whack Bag.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Because they're fat.  Can we really look into this, Steve?  I'm not even kidding.  No, I know you're not.  It's absolutely going to be left in, too.  You got the porn connections.  It looks like we got money. 
[03:42:30]  We got the couples.  We'll set some boundaries.  Got to find a sponsor.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  I thought that woman had such a shirt off.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Show us your fun day.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[03:43:00]  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This sounds beautiful.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Cancel your appointment.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Stay out the bushes.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[03:43:30]  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  All right.  We got lots of people that want in on that contest.  We got lawyers calling.  We'll figure it out. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, every time one of the lawyers, like, call and say,  I'm a lawyer, they never have it right.  It's probably like a fucking patent lawyer.  I'm a patent lawyer and I'll...  Shut up.  Exactly.  Ryan Starr, everybody.  Ryan.  What's up, guys?  Hey, sorry.  We got off on a little tangent there for about 45 minutes.  What's up with those people with the...  I'm 199 and a half.  I'm 199.  Ryan.  200-pound bitches.  Ryan. 
[03:44:30]  That's like high school and you're like,  I'm 15 and a half years old.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ryan, you know, all the rage is these weight loss shows.  So we got our own weight loss show we're going to do.  Yes.  We're going to get...  I want to do a weight gaining show.  Well, we're going to get couples and we're going to get the wife to lose weight,  25 to 30 pounds, somewhere around there in a month.  If she doesn't do it, the husband gets to bang a stripper of our choosing.  As the wife watches.  As the wife watches.  The wife has to watch him do it.  You guys doing it in the studio?  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, why not?  Right in front of us.  And if she does lose the weight, we'll toss her a few bucks per pound.  You know?  Good guys.  Yeah, because we're good like that.  Making the world a better place.  Just trying.  Ryan, you've been on the show for a minute and I still haven't heard my thank you.  I'm going to...  I have my speech right here.  I'll plan that.  You guys single-handedly brought me back on the show.  Brought him back.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I don't know if you saw it, but I won it by a landslide.  They won't release that, but I won it by a landslide and I'm going to owe it all to you 
[03:45:30]  guys for the support site that you did and also the 10 minutes of trying to figure out  how to text for me.  It was great.  And I'm telling you, it wasn't just a close call.  It was a landslide and we did it.  So thank you for everything.  Seriously.  Our listeners put you over the top.  Our listeners, especially our pests.  The pests came through.  Yeah.  Got the job done and Ryan Starr was able to go back on Supernova and sing last night.  And you did a great job.  I actually saw it.  Thanks, man.  No, it was cool. 
[03:46:00]  It was like I was there as a solo artist, you know, promoting my new album off the Rockstar  website.  And, you know, everyone else was still competing to be in the band.  I felt like I was kind of done with that.  It was exciting.  You know?  Can we start talking about how awful Brooke is as a host of that show?  No way, man.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  She felt so good.  She's beautiful.  You can't take that.  I'm going to get the opening from last night's show where she was trying to tell everyone  how exciting it is because it's the first part of a two-part finale for Supernova. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  And she's like, wow, we're so excited.  This is the first part of two-part grand finale.  It's just awful.  She's beautiful.  We all know that.  She's gorgeous.  But not as hot because she's now pregnant.  Wow.  Definitely not, then.  That just means she's not a virgin.  Dude, just let Dave Navarro be the host of that show and be done with the hot chick.  Or have a hot chick that just kind of hangs out where Dave sits.  Like, sucks his dick while he's doing the show. 
[03:47:00]  This is Brooke.  They got her because she's eye candy.  But she stinks.  Dave Navarro is carrying that whole show.  Him and Tommy Lee.  Dave Navarro is my hero because he was a big fan of mine on the show.  I can't take that away.  But I got to say, Brooke Burke, I love her, man.  She's so good.  He's not going to.  Ryan, he's not going to roll over.  Ryan, relax.  We'll make it perfectly clear that we're trashing her, not you.  So I love the show.  We like Mark Burnett.  You know, the whole deal.  But whatever.  So what's next for Ryan Starr? 
[03:47:30]  So, well, speaking of Mark Burnett, he's really been awesome.  He took me under his wing to believe me as an artist.  And we're starting to work already.  He made me a live album last week that we made in the CBS studios in front of the live crowd.  And he's putting it up on our website like today.  So that's been awesome.  And the next step is to start going out.  Come back to New York first off.  I'm definitely going to hit you guys up if you have me.  Play some songs for you.  And maybe while the couples are having sex, we can work that out.  Yeah, you can make the soundtrack. 
[03:48:00]  But, you know, I'm going to go on tour and then make a proper album when I get some time  and get in the studio and do it the right way.  I mean, it's a really exciting time.  I mean, I feel like there's a huge opportunity.  But now I've got to bridge the guy from the TV show to the guy that's going to have a solo career.  Yeah, right on, man.  You're off to a great start.  That's for sure.  And thank you once again for everything.  I mean, that was huge.  When they told me and they said it was a landslide, the first thing I thought was like,  those guys did it, man.  That's awesome.  Yeah, we have a bit of power with this show.  And I want a car. 
[03:48:30]  So anytime you need a ride, just call me.  Hey, nice.  I saw that last night.  I'm like, not only did we get him back on the show, we got him a car.  How am I going to commission that?  How am I going to?  Wow.  What did they give you?  You know, it was an awesome.  Honda?  It was actually a Honda.  I thought it was an elevator, but it's actually a CRV.  So it's this like cool SUV car they gave me.  And it's like got navigation and leather seats.  And I just don't know where to park it in Manhattan, but I'll figure it out.  Yeah, good luck.  Try the meatpacking district around 14th Street on the west side. 
[03:49:00]  You'll find a lot of really tall women.  But then the car is going to smell like meat.  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah.  You can say that again.  Sure will.  Meat and shame.  Why are there tear stains?  I love that you leather seats.  Don't ask.  All right, Ryan.  We got to wrap up the show.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Yo, thanks for having me.  You guys, seriously, this is like my third time on through the whole thing.  And it made a big difference.  And I love the support.  I mean, yeah, it's my hometown, so it means a lot. 
[03:49:30]  And I'll see you when I get back to New York.  Hopefully, I can play some songs with you.  Cool, man.  Does Lucas win?  I'm going to taping now.  It didn't happen yet.  It's going to happen sooner than it airs.  Going to the taping.  Oh, no, no.  I'm not trying to get you to blow up.  He means do you think that Lucas win?  Yeah, do you think?  I think it's, I've said since day one, if you ask me the first day, I think he's going  to win.  He's like mini Tommy.  He's mini Tommy Lee.  He hacked up that Coldplay song last night, though. 
[03:50:00]  You think so?  Yeah.  I'm a fan of his.  I get what he does.  I respect him more than anybody.  I know it sounds like I'm trashing everybody.  I'm sorry.  I think he's great, but the beginning of the Coldplay song, I wasn't feeling it last  night.  That's all.  This guy, Lucas, he's a front runner.  If he's feeling it, he does it.  And hopefully, he can be a good singer for this band, because I think they're going to  need someone to make the band.  If they want to have a career, they're going to have to get the best singer they could.  Wait, can't you still win? 
[03:50:30]  No.  No, no.  Which is good, actually.  I'm already Ryan Starr, the solo artist, so we're all good.  Yeah.  I mean, Supernova's going to have a run for a year or two, and then that's it.  That's it.  So, Ryan Starr.  Yeah, we'll see.  I mean, I'll go to the concert.  I'll make it out.  I'll be there.  No, Ryan Starr, you're in a much better position being a solo artist, and then you can control  your own future, and you got all the exposure from the TV show.  You're in a perfect spot.  It's not a bad second prize, you know?  It's not a bad consolation prize.  And I got the car, so what the hell.  All right.  Cool, man.  Thanks, Ryan.  Talk to you soon, bro. 
[03:51:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right, Ryan Starr from Supernova.  Very nice.  We won him a car and a spot back on the show to perform one last time.  Nice.  We cannot forget what we have to play.  The new WoW Sweeper?  Steve's acting?  Steve's acting.  Yes.  I didn't know it was a WoW Sweeper.  I got to hear.  I have to hear his accent.  All right.  Acting from Steve.  Again.  Yeah.  Well, we got new WoW Sweepers.  We got the ONA crew explaining WoW. 
[03:51:30]  The first one here was written by Sam.  Want to get WoWed?  Yeah.  Well, then put a WoW sticker on your car and drive.  It may not happen today, but eventually some lovely young lady will pull up next to you and flash you.  But how do I get a WoW sticker?  Just go to opianthony.com, silly.  Click the link, get a free WoW sticker, and wait for the beautiful Buxotics.  Hooray!  A free sticker and fun bags.  You betcha.  Now go to it. 
[03:52:00]  Compelling.  That's just a straightforward one.  That was.  Let me tell you.  I love when people feel the uncomfortableness and then just start spouting stuff out.  That, no reflection on your part in that, Sam.  Okay.  None at all.  Because you played it just like you were supposed to.  That's right.  But it, the way it was written, and who was that, Sam?  Yeah, fucking Mad Magazine.  College radio.  Oh, no. 
[03:52:30]  That was awful.  Let's get Sam in here and talk to him.  It was, it sounded, um, unprofessional.  Like the work of a rank amateur.  Yes.  Amateuristic.  Wow.  I guess the honeymoon's over with Sam, huh?  Jesus.  It really wasn't up to, uh, snuff.  Tell fucking Swanfeet to walk in here.  Sam's not black. 
[03:53:00]  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure? 
[03:53:30]  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a nigger.  White or a nigger.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Cause he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  The one flaw in that song is the word nigger, and I'm telling you why.  It would have been much funnier if he said,  Bigger, big, bigger, if he's white, or a black gentleman,  or something else other than that. 
[03:54:00]  It would have been funnier.  Cause you expect it.  Well, the CBS version's funny because they say,  Mm, mm, mm.  But even here, it would have been funnier.  And it was a great song.  Yeah.  But something like that, it's so funny because, you know, you so know where everybody's going.  You so see that coming.  Yeah.  And then just to put something completely gentle.  Or a black gentleman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  White or a black fellow.  That would have been very good.  Sam, Anthony wants to yell at you.  Sam, I'm not going to yell at you.  A little critiquing that I've done.  Of course, I am an award-winning producer of commercials. 
[03:54:30]  If you remember, I won an Air Award, Opie, for my commercial spot.  Which spot was that again?  It was for a head shop, I believe, in Massachusetts.  Thank you.  It was a whole Cheech and Chong character thing.  Which?  Written, produced, directed.  Which homeless guy in Huntington has your trophy?  I have no idea.  I think that ended up in the fireplace.  I'm an award-winning production artist.  Can't prove it anymore, but. 
[03:55:00]  I know.  But I was there, and I can.  Thank you.  Vouch for it.  Yeah.  Before my ex-wife threw away my award.  Just to teach you a lesson.  I stink.  Well.  Her time.  Whatever.  It seemed to me like that was some type of broadcasting school project.  And the results thereof.  Here's what you need to do.  Here's the criteria that must now fit into this promo. 
[03:55:30]  Do it.  And that's what you did.  Well, my mission was to just make something informative.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And still be informative.  In lieu of anything entertaining.  Maybe.  See, here at XM, we like to think outside the box.  Right.  Lee Abrams would tell you that.  You shut yourself in it.  Wait, can we hear some of that again?  Maybe with Sam here?  No, no.  But I mean, maybe he could explain what he was thinking during a certain week.  I would like to.  Well, he wrote another one, so why don't we just play the one we haven't heard.  Maybe it was a fluke.  Yeah, maybe. 
[03:56:00]  Huh.  Hey, voiceover guy, my commute isn't bad thanks to Opie and Anthony on my radio.  But I need something more.  Hmm.  How about female protuberancy?  Sure, but how?  Just go to opiandanthony.com and get a WOW sticker for free.  Then smack it on your car and wait for the lovely ladies to display their fun day.  Wow.  Great.  Thanks for all your help, Mr. Voiceover.  It's my pleasure.  Here at the O&A Show, female protuberances are our business. 
[03:56:30]  All right, I have even more problems with that one.  You're fired.  First of all, the music is so loud.  Yeah.  It stinks in the mix.  Second of all, who's voiceover guy?  Me.  So shouldn't you have a voice?  Well, I didn't cast or produce any of these.  Oh, wow.  Okay, now I'm giving you points for passing the buck.  Good job.  But I didn't tell you.  It was other people. 
[03:57:00]  But all the editing.  Dan's part of the sweeper is saying voiceover guy, so at that point you're expecting voiceover guy.  Hey, voiceover guy.  Yeah, you know, one of those voiceover.  I thought it would be voiced over by Steve, who does a very good voiceover voice.  Then why didn't Steve do it?  I don't know.  Those aren't my decisions to make.  I refuse to be part of this crap.  Well, no, he just said he wanted to do this certain.  Man, where's fucking Steve with his official explanation?  Steve always has the official explanation. 
[03:57:30]  Steve, why didn't you play the part of voiceover guy?  In Sam Debacle No. 2.  Sam's horrid college radio spot.  Because it was labeled Sam Debacle No. 2.  Really?  Is that why?  Did it want to be part of it?  No, the reality, I'm trying to get these guys more involved with production, and I just,  really, I was so busy with other phone calls, especially with Cleveland stuff coming up,  I gave it, I handed it off to Sam and said, it's all yours.  The official explanation.  There you go.  I am crossing these two out.  We don't want them in the system. 
[03:58:00]  For some reason, yeah.  Right in the room, actually.  It just doesn't really have a polished, not that anything we do is polished here,  but it doesn't sound professional.  More importantly, how does it feel knowing that the honeymoon is over, Sam?  You were just skipping around this joint for the last two months getting paid.  That's right.  Everybody's getting hard.  Once you get a paycheck, it's over, Johnny.  The honeymoon is over.  Now we pay attention to what he actually does for us. 
[03:58:30]  The first one, though, I think wasn't that bad.  The first one wasn't bad?  It might have had some, yeah.  Maybe put it on your iPod.  No, no.  I always say we give it one more listen.  It might not be bad.  I'm just saying.  You know what?  We'll never know.  I see where he's going with this.  So do I, but we have to get to this.  Steve.  By the way, congratulations.  I have never critiqued anybody else on the program.  Anthony's just surly.  He hasn't slept.  I'm very sleepy, too.  Wow stickers from Zurich.  Yes. 
[03:59:00]  And this is featuring Steve with an accent?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  What accent is it?  Oh, no.  You ever see The Saint?  That, by the way, how you know an accent is going to suck.  When you get one accent, they go, well, do you ever, it's, it's, it's independent to film.  Do you, from The Saint?  Yep.  There you go.  It's so early.  That's it.  Thank God.  I borrowed Val Kilmer's voice from The Saint.  He borrowed Val Kilmer's voice.  Probably poorly.  Hey, we don't have to talk to the couples that want in on the contest anymore.  And it has to be married couples. 
[03:59:30]  Just get their info.  So, we want a lot to lose.  Tell them they're in.  So, you gotta be married.  We want it to end in divorce, possibly.  Our contest.  Are you ready for this?  This is wow stickers from Zurich, written by Steve and Danny.  All right.  Danny.  Okay.  Holy crap.  Uh, Jeremy.  Good morning, shit-ticks.  Hey.  Hey.  It's after 11.  Is this live?  Yes, it is.  Are you talking to us?  Oh, fabulous.  I don't know. 
[04:00:00]  You tell me.  All right.  Hold on.  That was like bubbling stew.  Mark that down.  Ew.  Dinty more.  That was.  A little chili.  Turkey beef mixed.  Oh, God.  I give it a...  I do my farts differently.  I like to push at the last second really hard.  Could be dangerous.  All right, Jeremy.  Yes, we're live.  It's April 18, 2004.  For a second, I didn't even notice. 
[04:00:30]  I'm like, it is?  No, we should get credit for going late for once.  Late.  It's September.  I want to get credit today.  September 13, 2006.  We're late.  This is bonus time.  We don't get paid for this.  Yeah, don't gripe.  All right, here we go.  Wow stickers from Zurich, written by Steve and Danny.  Oh, boy.  There are many ways to get an Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  This is not one of them. 
[04:01:00]  Hello.  I am selling Wow stickers on Craigslist.  Please wire $4,000 an hour into a number...  Okay.  Kill yourself.  Just fucking kill yourself.  Knew that was coming.  Knew that was coming.  What?  You're laughing.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, come on.  Okay.  I want the plot to thicken here, though.  Steve's using his range. 
[04:01:30]  He's got a nice range.  He's a German bear.  Grr.  Hey, just bite Jews.  There are many ways to get an Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  This is not one of them.  Hello.  I am selling Wow stickers on Craigslist.  Please buy a $4,000 American through a numbered account in Zurich, and I'll happily send you a  Wow sticker.  Shiny and new.  I have a friend in the shipping industry, so shipping won't be a problem.  Get your own Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  Go to opieandanthony.com and fill out the online form. 
[04:02:00]  We'll send you a shiny new Wow sticker, and you'll be enjoying some lovely melons in no  time.  Hawk also stinks in that one.  But by the way, Zsa Zsa Gabor, what was your inspiration to do it in a German accent?  The idea from it actually came from a spam mail that Danny got offering a car that was  based in Switzerland, and the request was to send $4,000 to a numbered account in Zurich  or something like that.  I'm waiting for that same car.  Are you really?  I spent my money, yeah.  A lot of people get that same car. 
[04:02:30]  Unfortunately, it wasn't a fucking acting class mass mail.  Thank God I won a bunch of money from Nigeria, but I wouldn't be able to pay for it.  We were working on another one based on this concept of the spam-based promo.  The spam-based promo.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F-minus in my book.  Who is that?  That's one of the guys that works for Bush.  Is it?  Homeland or...  Oh, when Katrina?  FEMA.  FEMA, maybe. 
[04:03:00]  FEMA.  Maybe a little FEMA action.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  This is not how you're going to...  Hey, good one, Jimmy.  This shit's been called, I want to get fired, and then she's been, this is how you get fired.  Even until I did my...  Jason from Rye, could someone give that Zurich zilch Steve a Dutch oven?  Freddie from Jamaica Station, Zurich wow sticker promo sucks a fat dick. 
[04:03:30]  What's his name again?  Freddie Nutsack.  Yeah, look that up.  Good luck.  Freddie Nutsack.  All right, should we play a little, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show,  and then get that a lot out of here?  Yeah, please.  It was very educational.  We want to bring back, what did you learn?  Maybe the line of the date thing.  And that's that.  Jeremy, what's up?  I'm tired.  Hey, what's up, Papa Boys?  Hello, how are you?  It's good you called the program.  Thank you for calling us. 
[04:04:00]  We have ways of making you wow.  Please dial the number and give us a call and tell us what you've learned.  You would like that, wouldn't you, if I was...  Oh, go ahead, sorry.  I didn't mean to do the accent.  You just jump right in and you would know better than I would.  Oh, it's so early.  Okay, anyway, I want...  You should have got Anthony to do it.  I would laugh at that.  Thank you for the bonus time, and thank you for bringing the gift of the Traveling Virus  and another almost week and a half at the Tarsity Amphitheater on September 23rd. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, what's the buzz up there in Cleveland?  Are we going to have a good show up there?  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm trying to get together, like, all my friends and stuff to, like, you know, get a good tailgate going.  We're trying on FBA to get a tailgate.  We're deciding if we're going to drink at a bar or tailgate in the parking lot.  All right.  And I'm trying to find out what they got, because they got some open container laws down here in the counter.  Wow, this guy, yeah.  He has not had to get a bar sticker.  Do not leave a ring in the bathtub when you're told to clean it.  All right.  All right. 
[04:05:00]  Hey, um...  I've podden you.  When's our interview, in five minutes?  Yeah.  That's the only reason we're doing bonus time.  Oh, fuck a duck.  It was either this or just, like...  You got that?  I was hoping to do that for my car.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was either that or just kind of stand around and look at each other.  I got rugs to look at today.  I got carpeting.  Don't get a toupee.  Don't get yourself a hair covering.  Get a hair piece.  Put your furniture upon it. 
[04:05:30]  Dude, you got me hooked.  I walk around my place now.  When I'm doing the tap...  Dude, this morning, I was driving in, and out of nowhere, I'm just listening to the news.  Out of nowhere, out loud, I'm the only one in my vehicle.  And I go, well, the difference, when I'm doing the tabless...  The tabless.  The tabless.  The tabless.  The tabless.  I can't stop doing it.  I can't either.  I just walk around the house going, when I'm doing the tabless...  I'm trying to turn all the people on to it.  It's different than the exotic.  The exotic.  When I'm doing the tabless... 
[04:06:00]  The tabless.  Yeah, I can't do it like you.  You say O and A at the same time.  Tabless.  When you're doing the tabless...  I love that bit.  You start the O, but then end with the A.  When you're doing the tabless...  The tabless.  The tabless.  It's just wonderful in freeing, the tabless.  All right, let's...  We got to bring What Did We Learn back to the show.  We do that today.  Tim in New York, what did you learn on the only Anthony show?  We learned that boxcars get very hot in the summer.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Tim. 
[04:06:30]  Hey, Twinkle Toes.  Hey, I learned that Ginny Sack is enjoying one that huddles in her basement over a pile of candy bars.  What?  Work is freedom.  All right, Jim in New Jersey.  I'm essential to see what did I learn, effort.  Jim in New Jersey, Jim.  You had your one-armed shoveler.  Hey, boys.  Hey, boys.  Today, I learned Norton will let hooker's piss on him.  We won't fuck a 16-year-old.  Yeah, sir.  I'm not a criminal.  Yeah, he's not a creep.  I'm a pervert.  I'm not a fucking pedophile. 
[04:07:00]  Come here, blondie.  Come here, boy.  Allison in Jersey.  I learned today that retards like football because they wear the same helmet.  There you go.  I like that one a lot today.  David in Michigan.  David.  Hey, boys.  Boys, I learned today that not every retard parent is an oversensitive moron.  What's that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy was actually pretty cool considering, you know, he was smite by God.  Well, we thought so, but apparently...  Smite by God. 
[04:07:30]  I don't know why you would let it live because you're just poisoning the gene pool.  Obviously, it is inferior.  It's inferior.  Why would you shake Black Earl's hand when he wins the Olympics?  Let's go to Jackson in Florida.  Get it?  Hey, guys.  His name's Jackson.  He's from Florida.  Right.  It's crazy.  What's up, Jackson?  I learned that The Rock's new movie is called The Gergerger.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we did learn that earlier today.  Well, we got Roland in studio.  So, The Rock is going to call Friday? 
[04:08:00]  Friday, yes.  And he's going to discuss his new movie?  Yes.  And the movie is...  Was it...  We don't know.  Go ahead.  The Gridiron...  Was it...  I forgot the last part.  I just blanked down.  I had it in my head.  No.  You didn't.  No, don't look at it.  Don't look at it.  Don't look at it.  Nice one.  Get the rock trap.  He's actually helping it back to that corner.  All right.  So, The Rock is calling Friday.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Calm down. 
[04:08:30]  There's not a lot of people listening.  Maybe a mere million at this point.  And more than that, actually.  We got old Canada.  Oh, yeah, Canada.  More than that, gentlemen.  Got an Ed in Canada.  So, all right.  The Rock's new movie.  The Gridiron...  Gosh.  Gate?  Is it?  Gate?  The Grid...  He just completely panicked.  The Gridiron Gate.  And I know your bosses listen to the show.  We think you're unbelievable and do a great job with booking guests. 
[04:09:00]  Absolutely.  That is nothing...  This has nothing to do with your job before.  We had had so many problems getting guests and organizing that until you came on board.  Right.  And now it's amazing.  So, please.  It's not about your job.  But, my God.  You are hysterical on my...  You know, what's the name of the film?  I had in my head...  You know it.  The Gridiron, um...  Exhibit.  The Rock. 
[04:09:30]  The Gridiron Exhibit.  No, I was just thinking...  What are you doing?  I don't know.  The Gridiron...  No, don't look it up.  Don't look it up.  Don't look it up.  It's cheating.  That's not fair.  It's the...  The Grid...  See, the bit's not fun if we let you off the hook.  Gridiron.  Oh.  Yeah.  Gridiron.  I know you can do it.  Let's go.  Gridiron.  The Gridiron...  No, it's not The Jail.  Fuck.  The Gridiron Jail?  The Gridiron Jail? 
[04:10:00]  See my new movie.  The Rock says The Gridiron Jail.  What do you just call it with an E?  You just said The Gridiron what with an E?  Hmm.  I don't know.  Exhibit?  No, no, no.  He's in the movie also.  Exhibit.  Oh.  All right.  Keep chewing that gum nervously, by the way.  Yeah.  Chomp, chomp, chomp.  Chomp, chomp, chomp.  Chomp, chomp, chomp.  What is it?  I had it in my head, but I totally blanked out.  Come on.  Think on your feet.  Here you go. 
[04:10:30]  What is it?  I'm surprised you remember even to...  Oh, forget it.  Damn it.  I had it.  I had it.  I had it.  Oh.  Oh.  Damn it.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Go ahead, sweetie.  You can do it.  Oh, man.  No, don't look.  No, don't let him cheat.  Come on, Roland.  Roland, that's not fun if you cheat.  It's not fun.  You can't go and touch my blackberry.  I'll smack.  Cover it, blackberry.  Just cover it.  All right, you got it?  No, I haven't looked it up because Sam's freakishly hand covered my screen. 
[04:11:00]  Oh.  You're going to take that, Sam?  You have to.  Oh.  Yeah.  The good iron.  Good iron.  Come on.  Come on.  Starts with...  Come on.  What?  Just...  Just spit it out.  What's it about?  Maybe that'll help.  Like, uh...  Him and Exhibit rehabilitate some prisoners. 
[04:11:30]  They start a football program.  And they play against some other team.  And they win.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  I'm just fascinated by this.  Wow.  Because off the air, he's just a different person.  So the movie's called?  Gridiron. 
[04:12:00]  So there's a lot of them.  Wow.  You group all these people into what?  You said the word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gridiron.  I am blanking.  You can do it.  Come on.  I had him in the go.  Just talk it out like you have it.  Yeah. 
[04:12:30]  One more try.  Throw it a little bit.  The gridiron game?  No.  Huh?  Huh?  What?  The gridiron game?  No.  It's not that.  Yeah.  Huh.  Mm-hmm.  Uh.  Mm-hmm.  I blinked.  You blink a lot.  On air I do, but, uh, I just don't do well on air. 
[04:13:00]  I, just think about it.  No, trust me, you do very well on air.  If I could, we just, I would say black there.  No, but that defeats the purpose.  Yeah.  If it doesn't, then I can know, then I can say it's the gridiron ball.  And I'm like, ah, like a leaf.  Ugh.  Okay.  Okay.  You can do it.  Okay.  It's gridiron.  Gang.  Gridiron.  Gang.  Huh?  Gang?  What word are you saying?  Gang.  All right.  So what?  Gang.  Gang.  All right.  So what's the Rock's, uh, movie? 
[04:13:30]  The gridiron gang.  All right.  Thank you.  Pinchy.  That's it.  Pinchy, what did you learn on the show today?  We got to get out of here.  Hey, I, today I learned that, uh, Steve Zurich while promo sounds like one of Val Kilmer's  characters from the, that movie, The Same.  Of course.  All right.  Yeah, we did learn that.  Matt in Cleveland.  Matt.  Hey, boys.  What's happening?  Sweet tits.  How are you?  Hey.  Hey, I learned today that Roland is a babbling fucktard.  That's right.  I said fucktard.  It's my gift to you. 
[04:14:00]  All right.  Roland, what did you learn today?  Yeah.  What did you learn on the show?  You listened to most of it.  Um.  Hold on, Accio, or whatever your name is.  Go ahead, Roland.  What did you learn on the show today?  What did I learn on the show today?  Yeah.  The Gridiron Gang.  That's what the Rock's movies call.  Oh, my God.  Accio.  We'll end on a good one here.  Accio.  Accio.  Okay. 
[04:14:30]  I'm not going to wait around.  Cody in California.  What's up?  Hey, I just want to say what I learned today.  All right.  I learned that The Rock's going to be on the show Friday wide.  There you go.  We want a real good one to end with.  Nathan in Florida.  Nathan.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I learned that three stingrays can form a diamond.  Thank you, sir.  Yes.  Hey, that's right.

[04:15:00]  Maggie.  Hey, I learned if you really want to torture a tard, pull their hair.  Well, their hair hurts, we learned today, yeah.  Yeah.  Right, right.  And also, I didn't get to understand why they're so fat, because Jimmy wouldn't shut up.  Oh.  Because I wouldn't shut up?  Oh, Jimmy.  All right.  I had a good line for that.  It's out Friday wide.  Wide.  My line was, to the lady that just called, the reason they're fat is because their parents 
[04:15:30]  feed them a lot, because this way no one will want to fuck them, because they don't know  how to say no, so you have to make them big and unfuckable, but I said it in a funny way  before.  Exactly.  You don't need to learn why they're fat.  Just accept the fact that they are.  All right.  With that, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Yeah, Bob.  Thanks, Roland.
