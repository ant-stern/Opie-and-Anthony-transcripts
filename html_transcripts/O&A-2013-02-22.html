<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with chaotic banter, rife with profanity and sexual innuendo.  The hosts initially discussed a viral video of kids performing a "gallon smash prank" in a supermarket, finding the prank hilarious.  This segued into Opie's envious frustration at a family leaving his building for a Jamaican vacation while he remained in cold New York, prompting a discussion of past vacations and tropical island stereotypes.  A significant portion focused on their upcoming bus tour, planned to hit Dollywood, Nashville, Memphis, Branson, Missouri, and Austin, Texas.  They debated logistics, potential problems,  the possibility of separate "party" and "moderation" buses, and dual audio feeds, acknowledging sponsorship and budget concerns.  The absence of Gary (on vacation), the new SiriusXM CEO, and the show's booking process, including a disagreement over a guest ("GL"), were also discussed.  The segment concluded with an analysis of a marching band video recreating video game scenes.

The show continued with a discussion of marching bands and cheerleading videos, followed by a pivot to Vice President Joe Biden, focusing on a purported incident where he advised firing shotguns from porches to deter intruders.  This transitioned to the Oscar Pistorius case and speculation about his bail hearing.  A lengthy segment was devoted to a high-pitched man interviewed for *Parents Magazine* about gun control, generating crude jokes about his perceived gender ambiguity.  Roland's failed attempts at booking guests led to reminiscing about past interviews, including a less-than-flattering recollection of their experience with Loverboy.  Bobo's relationship woes were also discussed.  Oscar predictions were made, followed by a bizarre, crude advertisement for a fictitious segment, "The Hyman Hunter,"  featuring Anthony Dundee's search for "untouched teen girls."  The hosts then discussed Radiohead, recalling an encounter with Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds at a previous show, and their differing views on Radiohead's refusal to play "Creep."  Personal anecdotes about childhood experiences with alcohol, guns, and marijuana, along with stories about their uncles and family dynamics, were shared.  Discussions of guitars made by their Uncle Joe and the John Fogerty/Creedence Clearwater Revival lawsuit (comparing "Run Through the Jungle" and "Old Man Down the Road") concluded this section, with excerpts of the CCR songs played.

The next segment began with further jokes about the John Fogerty lawsuit and Vanilla Ice's purchase of "Under Pressure."  The hosts then transitioned to *My Strange Addiction*, specifically a woman addicted to bee stings, and a clip of a woman having an orgasm on Current TV in front of Joy Behar.  A substantial portion focused on their frustration with their security detail (Kenny and Chris), who escorted them to the bathroom and watched them from afar, leading to embarrassment and ridicule from other SiriusXM employees (mentioning the "mashup" and other shows).  Chris was directly ordered to stop. This led to discussions about perceived phoniness from other radio personalities (Artie Lange and Robin Quivers).  They discussed promotions for their network, including "Unmatchables" and an audiobook called "Fifty Shades of Gay," and a WWE storyline involving a racist wrestler,  Alex Jones's reaction, and the show's negative image within SiriusXM, specifically relating to the bathroom escort issue.  The segment ended with further discussion of the bathroom situation, a woman claiming to have orgasms at will, and personal anecdotes about premature ejaculation.


This segment heavily featured the racist wrestler storyline from the WWE, including Jack Swagger's DUI and marijuana possession arrest, and its potential impact on WrestleMania.  They discussed the percentage of the wrestling audience believing the sport is real, concluding only young children likely did. The segment contained derogatory comments about wrestlers’ intelligence and racial slurs.  Alex Jones's views and the WWE wellness policy were discussed (via a listener call). A significant portion focused on the woman addicted to bee stings, with graphic descriptions and vulgar commentary on her actions and her husband's reactions.  A radio story about a former colleague working under a false identity was mentioned.  The segment included a Black History Month bit, a humorous but offensive skit about the invention of the refrigerator, and a brief mention of Donald Sutherland's appearance on the show.

The final segment began with Anthony recounting a meditation session interrupted by a light and a scolding for phone use.  The main focus was the embarrassment of having security, "Club Soda Kenny," escort them to the bathroom.  E-Rock (a show producer) was in studio. Anthony announced the end of this practice. Opie, via phone and text, offered explanations, suggesting it stemmed from Opie's unpredictable behavior and company concerns.  They called various colleagues to discuss the situation.  A side conversation involved E-Rock's anger at Anthony for calling him "Slabo."  Oscar Pistorius' bail amount was briefly discussed.  A Dollar Shave Club advertisement aired, followed by further discussion of the bathroom escort situation.  The show concluded with Alan, an intern, tasked with finding witnesses to the bathroom escorting, his ineptitude becoming a running joke.

[00:03:00]  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:03:30]  Oh my God.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, this is insane.  So flatulent.  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real. 
[00:04:00]  That's sex.  Turn in with no expectations.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  The Anthony Show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Check.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning. 
[00:04:30]  You're on it.  But Opie Anthony, yeah.  Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up!  There are horrible people to say in this hole.  Objectional human beings and I want you to look unacceptable to my scene, but I'll give  it a go.  50 cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony Show.  Go, go.  I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking, Jimmy's trying to get blown.  And we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before. 
[00:05:00]  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of your, yeah, cause you really want to hear Opie Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  Yeah, the Opie Anthony Show.  Yeah, check it out.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, 50, yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this bitch.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga, booga, booga. 
[00:05:30]  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Good morning, everyone.  It's Friday.  That's pretty funny.  The gallon smash prank that everyone's talking about, huh?  Oh, God.  Going viral in front of our eyes?  I think so.  That's a funny one.  It's been sent to me a few times.  Yeah.  We got it on the Facebook page yet there, E-Rock.  Oh, yeah, we will. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, let's do that.  Opie Anthony, it's a gallon smash prank.  Just these fucking kids, three kids, and one of them at a time.  They just grab a gallon of milk and a gallon of orange juice, and they're walking down supermarket  aisles, and it's on camera, you know, and he just, the guy makes it like he's slipping  and smashes the gallon jugs on the floor, and it makes like he slipped.  Right.  And people are very distressed that he's hurt himself, but the milk, it goes everywhere. 
[00:06:30]  It goes flying everywhere.  And then everyone comes running to help the kid.  But he's obviously fucking just smashing the milk.  It's funny, man.  Because it gets to the point where all he does is stand there, pretty much just slams  him onto the floor, and throws himself into the puddles.  Doesn't even make it look like he slipped.  And those things explode and slide all over the place at the same time. 
[00:07:00]  I never realized how easily those fucking things explode like a bomb going off.  Right.  And of course, on Twitter, you know, I tweeted it last night.  Yeah.  What was the problem with this?  99.9% of the people are like, holy fuck, that's pretty cool.  That's pretty funny.  You know, one guy's like, sorry, dude.  Boring.  Right.  You just don't get it.  Still a big fan.  It's like, all right, you know.  Whatever.  You know what the new one is? 
[00:07:30]  Why?  If you hate Twitter so much, why are you on it then?  But you said something in there, and it's got to be said again.  99.  Yes.  Honestly, almost 99.8% of the people that I deal with on Twitter are beyond cool.  Fine.  It's that tiny, tiny, minuscule percentage.  Boy, if you hate Twitter so much. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, God.  Boy, for someone that makes fun of everything, you can't take it.  Exactly.  What the fuck?  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  Yeah, you're right.  I can't take it to this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big announcement.  I hope you can't take it.  Hit a message board.  Have fun with that.  Go.  Run with it.  Go run with it. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, boy.  This fucking thing gets funnier and funnier, though.  It really does.  There's something about it.  Look at this fucking asshole.  Toward the end of this fucking video, I was laughing so hard.  And then he tries to stand up, and it's like being on ice.  Yeah.  Now he's just being completely obnoxious and throwing the gallons of milk into the shelves.  Yeah.  He falls into the puddles. 
[00:09:00]  How about he just smashed them into the shelves next to him?  These poor old ladies got to deal with this asshole.  Yeah.  And they try to help.  Right.  Part of the ceiling came down.  I don't know.  You know what?  Bravo to these guys.  I just found that hilariously funny.  Bravo.  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[00:09:30]  Holy fuck.  It's Friday.  It's fucking winter.  You know what?  Have you had it?  I got into my elevator this morning.  I see nobody.  Yeah.  Because, you know, these hours.  It's very early.  I'm pretty much the first person, the first asshole to leave the building to go to work.  Even though I know.  I have to acknowledge.  You don't work.  You boo-hoo.  I just picture these guys on a hedge just waiting.  Just waiting for their opportunity. 
[00:10:00]  Work, huh?  Work.  Why don't you try?  And then insert real job here.  Yeah, of course.  They're just completely focused waiting.  Oh, are they ever.  Waiting for the first word I might mispronounce.  Anything.  Just anything.  I like that one.  Have you looked in the mirror?  Oh, yeah.  I got one of those.  That's a great one, too.  What the fuck was it for?  I forget already.  Oh, I...  I was making some... 
[00:10:30]  I don't know if you make fun of anyone, like Tara Reid or on Twitter or fucking somebody.  Oh, really?  I don't remember after I read it.  Yeah.  For the most part, it just goes completely away.  Oh, God.  Yeah, someone said that to me.  In the mirror.  It might have been one of the videos I posted recently.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, so I get in my elevator.  I see no one.  I mean, no one.  And this family gets on that I kind of like. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know many people in my building, and I don't socialize with a lot of people in my building,  because most New Yorkers are just assholes.  Yeah, they really are.  The people that I do talk to in my building, it turns out they're visiting from somewhere else.  And you can pick it out every time.  Like, oh, you obviously don't live in this building because you want to have a nice little conversation for a minute or two.  What are the guests of somebody in there?  They're always...  Yeah, and they're just so nice.  And you're like, yeah, this is how people are pretty much outside of New York.  I don't know what it is about New Yorkers. 
[00:11:30]  Anyway, this family gets on the elevator with their little suitcases.  They're a family of three.  They have me three kids and the parents.  I'm like, fuck.  Where are you going?  Jamaica.  And I'm sitting there like, fuck.  Because I think this might be one of those rare years I don't go away.  Yeah.  We haven't taken a vacation where we've gone to some warmer climate or anything through the winter.  Yeah, my second kid's too young to deal with that shit.  I think my wife's kind of hinting, and I'm thinking, I don't want to fucking deal. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Deal with a four- to five-month-old on a plane and at a resort somewhere.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I know.  It's just everything that's said now, it's all I fucking do.  It's almost impossible to have a conversation now.  Without.  Ooh.  My point being, extreme jealousy.  As I'm getting into a car, it's 20 what?  28 and just fucking that weird cold in New York because it's a little windy.  And they're heading off to Jamaica with their little suitcases.  You could see the happiness on their faces. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because right now, they're going through security and getting the first flight out.  Yep.  And by lunch, they're going to be, you know, it's going to be 85 and sunny with that cool  music that you only hear when you go away.  Why don't we listen to that music all the time?  It puts you in a great mood right away.  Because you're looking around, it's out of context, you know?  Is it?  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  That steel drum rules.  Oh, man.  You get off the airplane, you go through these shitty fucking airports. 
[00:13:00]  Horrid airports.  And there's just a guy.  And you're like, ah.  Right away, you're happy.  Every airport is the airport from locked up abroad.  Yeah.  They got those guys in those military-looking uniforms.  Like, everyone.  Even the housekeepers wear fucking the hat and the uniform that looks like they belong to  some militia.  They're ready for a revolution.  Yes.  Ready for a revolution.  Yes.  And, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  You hear this music.  And I don't even know.  It's hot.  I don't even know if this is a guy that knows what he's doing. 
[00:13:30]  They all just seem to know how to play.  Right.  But I'm sure someone, some local would say, oh, man, that guy sucks on the steel drum.  You're just walking through the airport.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's the greatest.  Oh, it's fucking hot.  It's like about to 85 degrees.  You look like a.  Oh, this is nice.  You look like a New York asshole because you still have your winter coat on.  Yeah, yeah.  Even though it's 90 as you're walking on the tarmac toward the airport.  Pasty white.  Pasty white.  Yeah.  Then you start taking your layers off and just fucking tying them around your waist. 
[00:14:00]  Find that bar that's like a fucking, like a thatched roof fucking thing.  Right there.  Right here in the airport.  Yeah, in the airport with the spinning fan and the rum drinks.  Right.  Oh, man.  And then you go get your luggage that's piled up in one big, huge heap of nonsense.  Oh, I miss that.  And then you get the, uh, then you get the guy to drive you to wherever and he's on the  wrong side of the road driving like a complete lunatic. 
[00:14:30]  Just hoping to get to the resort.  Yapping about what type of trees we're passing and how they were brought over by the Spaniards  in fucking 1600.  And then you see all the locals that, you know, if they were allowed to, would be giving  you the finger.  But they've been told years ago, don't you dare.  That's our bread and butter, motherfucker.  But you see them.  You see their eyes.  They hate you.  Oh, do they hate you?  They hate you.  All the best beaches for that particular island goes to, let's say it, Whitey. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, look, man, I'm on vacation.  Right.  I, uh, I forgot which island I was at, but I like to, I like to do what they tell you  not to do.  I like to explore a little bit, right?  Oh, I never leave the compound.  And I, uh, I walked down the beach, this pristine beach that was part of the resort.  Not a rock to be had.  The water was like that blue that you can only see in your dreams.  Great.  And, uh, I walked down, uh, uh, not that far where the locals go when they're not fucking 
[00:15:30]  slaving away at the resorts.  There were rocks.  Like, I guess they just removed all the rocks around the resort.  Oh, they threw them on the locals' beaches?  They probably did.  The water wasn't as blue.  And they probably made them pick up the rocks and take them back to their fucking beach.  Pick up these rocks.  Take them to your own beach.  They gotta hate us.  Yeah.  Because we take up all the good beaches. 
[00:16:00]  Ah, I'm not gonna do that this year, I don't think.  I don't know.  No, I'm probably not gonna, uh, go away.  No?  No.  Not for the winter anyway.  Maybe once spring rolls around, although we do have our, uh, little trip.  Yeah, it looks like we're gonna be doing a bus tour.  Is that really gonna happen?  Because I just, uh...  Oh, by the way, yeah.  I believe it will fall through.  Okay, that's why...  And they will present us with something that is so half-assed and lame, but kind of related  to this. 
[00:16:30]  Well, yeah.  Because I know they walk away from us, like, yesterday, and they go, wow, that was really  easy.  Oh, boy.  Because they have these little quick meetings with us.  Yeah.  And I just say yes to everything.  Me too.  I have figured out years ago, just say yes to everything.  It's so much easier.  Because it all falls apart.  It does.  So, I, you know, there's already little things that could be problems, but I don't even feel  like bringing it up.  Why bring it up?  Because the whole thing is just gonna collapse.  Yeah.  It always does.  That's what I think.  And if it doesn't this time, fantastic. 
[00:17:00]  Job well done then, but...  But I say...  We're so trained to have things not work.  Yeah, I just say yes, yes, yes, yes, and they're like, oh, wow, okay, cool.  Hey, good, okay, we'll get right on back.  And then you get to go home early without any hassles.  You don't have to fucking argue any of your points, because you just know.  You just know.  Yep.  It seems like this one is gonna happen.  I mean, it always seems like this one is gonna happen.  Oh, Sam.  Maybe it's optimistic of me.  How long have you been at this now?  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:17:30]  But they're very...  Eight years, you're still extremely green.  How much do you want to bet this whole thing?  You still have hope.  Remember the sign, don't go home with hope?  Yeah.  It's still right there, right on the door.  This whole thing will turn into a minivan trip to Trenton.  Right.  That's what this fucking thing will turn into.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, they're talking for our southern friends.  We've never done a real southern trip before.  No.  We fly into New Orleans every once in a while.  Yeah.  But they're talking a bus trip where we broadcast every day. 
[00:18:00]  And the first leg of the trip is 11 hours.  11 hours of driving before we reach our first destination.  That means, because you know they're not gonna get a state-of-the-art tour bus, that means  that it's gonna break down a couple of times.  So that 11 hours is gonna be 15 to 16.  You know that already.  You think we're not getting like the Madden Cruiser?  They say we're getting the Madden Cruiser, but I don't think that exists.  They say you're getting two buses.  Two buses. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I think we're getting like a drinking bus and a sober bus.  Oh, uh-oh.  Okay.  So it's gonna be the O bus and the A bus.  I think so.  Okay.  Just so we don't kill each other.  Now that sounds interesting, to say the least.  No, I think we need two buses.  Yeah, we probably do.  So yeah, there might be an O bus and an A bus.  With equipment on both buses to like record audio.  So if you have an idea of what's going on at the moment, you can then, you know what 
[00:19:00]  I mean?  You don't have to wait for the live show.  Oh, that's good.  Will we be able to just turn the channel on?  Theoretically, yes.  Theoretically, yes.  Also, we're like, boom.  You know, there should be some sound effect like static.  Like, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And then all of a sudden, hey, man, I'm on the sober bus and we're bored as shit here.  Yeah.  And then-  That's theoretically, yes.  Holy fuck!  I'm puking on the fucking floor. 
[00:19:30]  But I hope people come out for this.  I hope people follow us.  Fuck it.  Follow us.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  In every meeting, Troy is guaranteed he can get bitches on the bus.  Bitches!  Troy, nobody brought up bitches on the bus.  Bitches!  He's like, I'm just saying.  I know I can get some bitches on the bus.  I love how he talks.  He rolls.  Bitches.  Oh, boy.  So we're thinking Dollywood?  Yeah, yeah.  Heading to Dollywood.  And then after that, we're going to where?  Nashville?  I think Nashville. 
[00:20:00]  I think Nashville is after Dollywood.  And then we're going to go to-  Are we going to Graceland?  Oh, yeah.  Memphis is on it.  Then we're going to go to Memphis.  Dollywood.  To Nashville.  Nashville.  To Memphis.  Memphis.  I got this.  To Branson, Missouri.  Fucking Branson.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking Yakov better be ready for us.  Yep.  And broadcasting in his parking lot.  And then-  And then I think we end in Austin, Texas, right?  Austin, Texas.  It was either that or New Orleans.  We've been in New Orleans.  I'm like, I want to go to Austin, Texas. 
[00:20:30]  I want to go to Austin, too.  And then guess what?  I'm staying there for a few days.  Fuck these people.  Yeah, because then we're supposed to get on a plane and fly back.  And knowing these guys, you know, we only budgeted where you can be.  You're going to be in Austin for three hours?  Yeah.  Fuck you.  I'll fucking pay my own way.  I'm staying in Austin.  I've heard great things about it.  Yeah, I've heard it's a party fucking town.  So I would definitely hang out in Austin for a little while.  That's right.  Yeah.  So when is this going down?  They're thinking-  They told me yesterday, but I just said yes.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  For real, when is it going down?  Late April, early May.  Late April, early May.  All right.  Fucking rock.  All right.  I can do that.  I can do that.  You think this is really going to happen?  No.  I mean, they're putting everything behind it.  If this doesn't happen-  If Steven Singer doesn't fucking sponsor, we're fucked.  Oh my God.  You know that, right?  Because they're not going to pay for anything.  Right.  They're going to be like, well, I found a sponsor, so we're going to have to cut back just a  little bit.  It's going to be one bus.  Yeah.  The first cutback is going to go from two buses to one. 
[00:21:30]  To one bus.  Right.  Right.  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.  But it's a really nice bus.  It's one of the bigger buses.  And then the next stage will be half the staff can't go.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Well, since we only have the one bus-  We're going to have to cut down on the locations that we go to.  And I didn't hear hotels in there.  So they expect us to just hang out on the bus for the whole week?  Sleep on the bus, everybody?  And I swear to you, I'm not a diva, but I'm thinking a little- even if it's a cheap fucking  hotel room, it would be nice.  I'd rather pick up some of the local flavor with the hotel rooms.  That's right.  How long before the whole thing- 
[00:22:00]  Nice Holiday Inn Express.  I'll do one of those.  Nice.  It's nothing.  How long before the whole thing goes from two buses to all those locations to one bus,  three days, D.C., Philly, Boston?  Right.  All the places we've been to already.  Yeah, of course.  And they're going to say, no, we didn't.  Yes, you did.  They suggested that right off the bat.  Yes, they did.  And nothing against our fine friends in those cities.  We love them.  We've been there so many times.  We're trying to like- 
[00:22:30]  Somewhere new.  We're kind of trying to see what else is out there.  It's kind of like NASA.  What can we do next?  Yeah.  Where else can we explore?  Let's send the rover further.  Right.  It's just a fun show going to those spots.  There's no epicness to it.  There's not Dollywood and Branson.  Oh, Branson, motherfucker.  Branson, motherfucker.  Yes.  How many days do we get in Branson?  Just the one.  One day.  It's one day per place.  One day.  One day.  Why?  Because we've got to make it to Austin for the next day.  How about we just do two weeks?  Who cares?  If we're broadcasting, it doesn't matter where we're broadcasting from. 
[00:23:00]  Just spend a few days in each locale?  Maybe not a few, but Branson, Missouri, I can't imagine we might need two days there.  We should have two days in Branson so we can go to catch a couple of shows.  Yeah, people are telling us Dollywood's a waste of time.  So one day in Dollywood, two days in Branson.  Yeah.  I'm thinking one day in Memphis is good enough.  Two days in Nashville.  Maybe, yeah.  One day in Austin, but then we stay there for a few days.  Right.  But that's not broadcasting when you stay in Austin, right? 
[00:23:30]  One day of broadcasting in Austin.  Two in Nashville.  Two in Branson.  One in Dollywood.  Because we got, in Branson, we got Kirby.  We got Pierce Arrow.  We got Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  Yeah.  We got the Brady Brunch.  Right.  I mean, come on.  And are we buying tickets for these events yet?  What if they're sold out, Sam Roberts?  We don't have concrete dates yet.  Ah, that's true.  If I'm not sitting in the Yakov-Shmirnov Dinner Adventure audience.  With our magnetic trays, genuine linen napkins. 
[00:24:00]  Then this trip is a bust.  Could you see we're sitting there, just fucking looking over, nodding like we finally here.  We finally made it to Branson.  And we got our magnetic trays, our fucking real silverware, authentic linen napkins, vegetable  medleys, sneaking in audio recorders.  Exactly, of course.  For that horrid show.  You know, some of us can only afford Branson.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:24:30]  But, you know, others are getting fed up, too.  I see that pushback.  I really am starting to see the pushback from the fucking people that get it, from the fucking  people that have always got it.  I see the pushback.  Yep.  And I'm loving it.  It's amazing the amount of people that wish death upon me.  Oh.  Yeah, but that's just fun.  That's the difference.  No, it's not.  That's just fun.  It's just kind of nice.  And then you go up to them and you go, why would you do that?  And they say, we learned it from you, okay? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, God.  Well, it should be nicer on the radio.  No, I'm talking about you.  Not me.  I've been nice for a while, man.  You just said it was fun when they gave me...  Yeah, but I've been nice for a long time.  Not to me.  It's kind of getting weird now.  Oh.  Not to Gary.  Gary.  I've been nice to him the last couple days.  Oh, I didn't know you meant, like, you were counting the hours.  He wasn't here.  Hmm?  He wasn't here the last few days.  There you go.  Did you know that?  So he should do that more often and then I'll be nice to him. 
[00:25:30]  Did you know he wasn't here?  I swear to God, no.  Where's he been?  On vacation.  You're kidding.  No.  He was gone all week?  Yeah.  You're kidding.  No.  I think he came back yesterday, right?  From where?  I don't know.  He was with his family.  I swear to you, I just assumed he was here every day.  No, he hasn't been here.  Wow.  Amazing.  I'm not even joking.  Never would have known.  You didn't know either?  No.  Oh, why would we? 
[00:26:00]  No.  Oh.  No.  I don't even know who the CEO of this place is.  I couldn't tell you his name.  You didn't go to the big meeting this week?  I wasn't invited.  The whole company was.  Yeah, but we get personal invites to stuff.  Oh, I see.  We get that, like, you know.  We kind of get the VIP fucking invites now.  And it's like, if you don't get the VIP invites.  Like when Mel Karmazin used to do those town hall meetings, he personally invited me.  I don't even know this guy's name.  Is he cool?  I don't know.  I didn't go.  I'd rather kind of fly under the radar with the new guys for a while. 
[00:26:30]  Yurok, is he cool?  Who is he?  I've never met him.  I don't know.  Did he used to work here?  Yeah.  So it's a guy they moved up?  Yep.  From where?  I don't know what department he was in.  Is Don Wicklund the fucking CEO of this company?  Oh, my God.  Imagine.  Could you fucking imagine?  He finally got there.  Top of the pyramid.  He's still wearing those shirts, though.  Of course he is.  Yurok, you went to the meeting, didn't you?  No.  Oh.  Yurok.  Why?  Comment.  Because I went home. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  Oh, excuse me.  So anyway, the bus trip is...  Yeah.  Can I see a picture of the new guy?  Looks like it could be fun.  That's him?  Mm-hmm.  Let me see if I've ever seen him walking around.  He looks like Rusty Staub.  Oh.  A little Rusty Staub in him.  A little Rusty Staub-ish.  Is he cool?  I've never seen the man before in my life.  Is he ready to take a little abuse?  I...  Not that I know of.  Was he a sales guy?  Like, what was he?  Before they moved him up? 
[00:27:30]  Let me find out for you right now.  I'm not trashing the guy, by the way.  I just don't know anything about him.  Hmm.  Interim CEO of SiriusXM.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he was president of sales and operation.  Oh.  Well, nice.  All right.  Okay, then.  All right.  So anyway, the family's going to Jamaica.  That family in my building.  Yeah, and we are going nowhere.  Yeah.  Except on this, perhaps this bus trip.  Possibly.  Some juncture.  Perhaps. 
[00:28:00]  What if we get to Nashville?  The AC just starts going out on the buses.  No, I don't care about stuff like that.  Eh, that would be an adventure.  That's, you know, that's all right.  I can handle stuff like that.  That's easy.  Comment?  Are you going to have the no shit rule on the bus?  Ah, the no dump rule.  Oh, that ain't happening on the old bus.  Oh, no.  The old bus, you get shit away.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's got to, you got to, when you got to go, you got to go.  I don't think Jimmy would stand for that.  I think, though, the door must be shut, and any exhaust fans must be turned on after said dump. 
[00:28:30]  And Jimmy's got a tough decision.  Does he go on the old bus or the A bus?  I think he knocks back and forth, yeah.  Are you guys going to draft teams?  A bus and O bus teams?  I don't know.  I'm debating if I want a Troy Kwan on my bus.  Well, Troy's got to be on.  I think Troy's got to be on my bus.  He is a party.  I think we should fight for Troy.  He is a party motherfucker.  We're going to fight for Troy.  And, you know, the bitches.  I don't think Troy's going to want to be on the silver bus.  And Troy has actually phrased it differently.  What did he say?  He said, there's a party bus and a married bus. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, fuck.  Which is just like, fuck.  That's just not nice.  I don't think he's going to want to be on what he says is a married bus.  You just made it sound extremely boring.  I know.  So that means Anthony's going to have Troy and Roland.  Oh, fuck.  Roland.  I'm stuck with E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  I hope he's just going to be staring at me and E-Rock waiting for a good time to happen. 
[00:29:30]  And it just won't.  You just hear like, the hum of the tires on the bus.  You're all just looking at each other.  For 11 straight hours.  You're on the iPhones and whatever and the Samsung and stuff.  And then you go to the other bus and it's just like,  Craziness.  We haven't heard much from the married bus, but the party bus keeps checking in.  Party bus.  You've got to see what's going on.  Smoke pouring out the windows.  You might have to, you know, bring a taste to the old bus. 
[00:30:00]  Exactly.  A little taste of that.  The old bus.  Booze.  A little bit, a little bit.  Yeah.  I hear you.  It's not an officially sober bus.  It's just.  Right.  In comparison.  It's called the moderation bus.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't want it to be called the sober bus.  The moderation bus.  That's the name of my bus.  Moderation.  It's even worse than married bus.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  That would be good.  Get some fucking names on the side of the bus.  Moderation.  Moderation.  And then fucking out of control.  You know.  O-U-T-T-A.  Control.  Out of control.  It's not even right grammar.  Who cares?  That's fucking nuts.  Don't matter.  Don't fucking matter.  Troy Kwan.  No matter what.  Fuck it.  There it is.  What?  No.  Doors open up.  Bitches.  No matter what city. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Where are we?  Oh.  We're fucking Nashville?  Everybody.  Oh shit.  Look at Troy Kwan.  He's got fucking bitches already here.  He's been on the phone.  Coordinating where we're fucking going to stop.  And already.  Bitches.  You're going to be turning on this channel a lot at 2 a.m.  Oh my god.  Every city you're in.  If you didn't come to Branson to party, what'd you come to Branson for?  I have a feeling there's going to be two different shows.  Kind of like our Twitter feeds. 
[00:31:30]  Oh my god.  Where I wake up in the morning and I pretty much tag Anthony.  It's a long distance.  It really is.  Tag team.  I see Anthony with his last tweet as I'm starting my tweets.  He's going to bed at 6.  I'm waking up at 6.  You know what this needs right now?  We need to fucking be on the air.  Right now.  That would be the best though.  Fire it up.  Yeah.  That would be the best radio.  Fuck it.  No one would ever know when the fucking station's just going to go live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop Bride for flying. 
[00:32:00]  I hope he'll make friends with his bus driver and your bus driver will hate you guys.  Motor in.  My name.  Motor in.  I needed an Asian boy to set off fireworks and firecrackers in my bus.  No guests today.  Yeah.  Nice.  We like when there's no guests.  How mad is Roland?  Roland was pushing a guest yesterday.  Oh, was he ever.  I told Travis already this morning, Roland's not going to come in here happy today. 
[00:32:30]  No?  I don't think.  That's my theory.  Why?  Did we fuck him up by not taking that guest?  It's just there have been a lot of no's in Roland.  Yeah, but.  He takes it as a personal offense.  Once again, they love the job he's doing.  It's a balancing act for us.  Sometimes we get into some shit and then we see the guests lining up and we're like,  fuck.  I feel bad that Roland takes it personally.  He never should.  When we say no to a guest, I never have it in my head that like, oh, let me fuck over 
[00:33:00]  Roland here or anything.  And I'll tell him again, the bosses love the job he's doing.  He's an amazing booker.  He really is.  Truth of the matter is, I expect to lose him at any day because I think he's going to get  even a better gig.  I think we know.  He takes it so personal.  It's like, dude, there's such a balance with this show.  Too many guests ruin it.  Too many comics ruin it.  Guests that don't fit.  Too much bitching ruins the show.  I get it.  So you're fucking spinning a whole shitload of plates constantly. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I didn't want GL.  You didn't want GL.  I'm not a fan of GL.  I'm not a fan of GL.  I've never been a fan of GL if you need to know the truth.  People are going to figure out who GL is when a man with those initials walks into the after  show today.  You took GL.  You took them?  I don't care.  I'll take anyone.  You really will.  You really will.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Lover boy, I'll take GL.  If I take LB, I'll take GL.  I would take LB. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Over GL?  Every time.  Every time.  Yeah.  So I got the GL thing.  No GL for me.  And I'm like, nah, I don't think so.  And then I was like, you know, it's Friday.  We don't like being guest heavy on a Friday.  Um, especially when Jimmy's gone, you know, it's kind of fun to just bat shit around in  here.  Right.  And then, uh, and then he was like, okay, well, Kevin Smith was supposed to call in and  he's like, well, maybe I can move Kevin and then he could take GL. 
[00:34:30]  And I'm like, ah, no, no.  And then, and then later I get another email that was like, well, now Kevin can't make it  anyway.  Kevin can't call in.  But I think he told Kevin to beat it.  He might have told Kevin to beat it.  To make some room for GL.  And then he's like, well, now how about GL?  I'm like, no, I really just don't, I don't want GL.  I'm glad you took the lead on this one.  A lot of times I'm sitting there with my phone like, ah, I'm like, cool, that doesn't want 
[00:35:00]  GL.  This makes it a lot easier.  I don't want GL either.  Yeah.  Yep.  GL's a big name too.  Big name.  Big.  Big.  But as far as fitting in with this program, really, and I know we've had guests that  don't quite fit in with the program, but there's something very interesting and something like  I want to ask them thing.  I really have no interest in GL.  I'm sorry.  It's not exactly Tom Skerritt.  Oh, Tom Skerritt.  TS would be fucking unbelievable.  If we could get Tom Skerritt.  We should kidnap him. 
[00:35:30]  Now, there.  Oh, man.  Bring him on the bus.  Kidnap him.  Which bus would Tom Skerritt be on?  He would be, uh.  He is 79, but.  I think he could still get some things done.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Man.  Yeah.  This bus trip's not happening.  I know why I know it's not happening.  It's not happening.  Because it's very rare.  Because we're excited about it.  Yeah, thank you.  Yes.  Because it's one of those things where I'm like, fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like we're excited about the studio being expanded.  I am counting down to the next Super Bowl, though. 
[00:36:00]  Oh.  Why?  Because I think it might happen this time.  You think you might be able to travel all the way there?  Yeah.  I hope so.  But I'm demanding a hotel.  I'm not going back and forth.  Right.  Yes.  15 miles away.  I don't give a fuck.  You know what?  That's a hard 15.  That 15 miles is going to be a really hard 15.  A hard 15.  Bridges and fucking traffic and tunnels.  I'll take a zip line or a fucking helicopter.  That's it.  Yep.  They should set up zip lines for the Super Bowl.  That would be cool.  Manhattan to the fucking.  Right across.  Meadowlands.  Whatever the hell they call it now. 
[00:36:30]  Iraq.  I thought you weren't going to go out of spite.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Man.  Fucking memory like an elephant too.  But what if they go helicopter?  What if they make.  The word.  645.  It's so fat of bacon.  What if they make it so easy they got a helicopter?  Oh, that would be cool as shit.  Or the zip lines they might put in.  You could zip line it into the stadium.  That's what I'm saying.  How cool would that be?  It's an open stadium.  Right into a box.  Right into one of those fucking boxes.  They go, all right, I'm here, bitches.  Right.  Let's watch some football. 
[00:37:00]  Where's the hors d'oeuvres?  Yeah.  I'm really, something in me is hoping for a crazy blizzard, freezing cold, ruin the entire  thing weather.  Because I really want to see the press go, we told you this was going to happen.  It's the most irresponsible decision the NFL could have made.  Nope.  No?  I think, they're not talking about it yet, but I think they're going to be doing some  futuristic shit.  Oh, right.  Because I think they really want to start moving this Super Bowl around to some colder 
[00:37:30]  places.  I think they're going to do some fucking futuristic shit.  Some crazy ass heat source?  Some blower something, where they go, yeah, we got this figured out.  People are actually going to be pretty warm in the stadium.  Just make this giant, almost tornado-y, spinning warmth around the entire place?  I'm telling you, I bet you they got this.  That'd be crazy.  Because there's no way they're taking a chance that it could be just shitty fucking single  digits with the snow. 
[00:38:00]  They don't care.  I think they would love a Super Bowl where it's snowing the whole time.  Do you know what it would take to heat a stadium if it was like 15 degrees out?  I'm not even talking just heating the whole thing.  Just something.  Some kind of blower.  Just throw a tarp over it.  Some blue tarp.  Some kind of...  Some fucking lights.  Maybe they hand out some of those fucking jelly things that you put in your fucking mittens  when you go skiing.  The hand warmers, and everyone has to hold them and wave them around.  Did I just say mittens? 
[00:38:30]  Awkward.  They do keep you warmer, though.  Well, how about the harp system?  Obviously.  Thank you, Denver Pest.  The harp system.  Yeah.  Maybe they break that out.  Unless they just figure out a way to heat the field, and then don't give a fuck about  the audience.  There's two...  I don't know.  I think they...  I just feel like they're going to figure something out.  Something.  I've never heard...  Maybe they lay down some shit where you can fucking keep your tootsies warm, at least.  Something.  I've never heard of anything, though.  We did that XFL crap, and the reason that was a bust, because you had to play in these 
[00:39:00]  stadiums in the middle of winter.  It was brutal for everybody.  Bizarre.  So why would the NFL do that?  When is the Super Bowl?  Early February?  Yeah.  That's like prime winter.  Dude, it's crazy to take a chance to play Russian roulette with the biggest game of the  year.  That's why I think they got some stuff they're thinking about.  I don't know what...  I've never heard of the technology that could do this, though.  Yeah, good point.  All of a sudden, they're going to bring it out and test it on the Super Bowl? 
[00:39:30]  That just seems like such a fucking gamble.  Maybe they'll have heating stations.  They couldn't even keep the lights on in the last Super Bowl.  True.  They're going to heat an entire outdoor stadium.  Well, that was because of Beyonce.  We all know that.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Fucking everything up.  Making it about her.  Beyonce.  Are you kidding me?  She's after all the electricity.  I need lights.  I need lights.  By the way, you think Kim Kardashian's ass is hot?  I went Beyonce to Kim Kardashian.  Yes, I did.  There's a picture of her today.  Holy fuck.  She's horrendous looking as a pregnant lady. 
[00:40:00]  Well, she's...  Yeah.  Pregnant women can be very sexy.  She's a mess already.  She ain't it?  Look at the picture of the paper.  It's brutal.  Let me see.  It's fucking brutal.  I need to see.  I'll just go to my...  Was it in today's paper?  Yeah.  Daily News or Post?  I don't know.  They're the same to me.  Yeah.  These papers are a complete waste of time.  Everyone, pick up your work...  Ew!  You see it, right?  Whoa!  See? 
[00:40:30]  Dude, that...  No one just bring it up and...  Wow.  How bad is that?  That's supposed to be like a...  All right.  Like an amazing ass.  It's a mess.  I'm even giving her the benefit of the doubt that she's got one foot way forward...  Right.  And this white thing she's holding is covered in the front.  Right.  So you really have no indication of...  No, just look at the black part of the dress.  The ass part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's brutal.  That is.  Her ass is way too big for me to begin with.  Oh, my God.  Like I'd ever have a chance with her. 
[00:41:00]  I know.  But, uh...  Like you can get that.  But that's a scary, scary fucking fat...  That's fucking fat.  Ass and a lot of cellulite, I would imagine.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  That's a big ol' ass.  Travis, what do you got?  Super Bowl shit?  Yeah, you guys were talking about the Super Bowl.  I've read that their contingency plans involve either moving the game to Saturday, if there's 
[00:41:30]  a snowstorm coming in, moving the game a week after, or a week before.  But now, don't people fly in and make time?  No, they can't do that.  Apparently, there are a lot of things that they didn't think of when they agreed to this.  When they agreed to do this.  Now, why would they agree in the first place?  Because it's New York.  What's in it for them?  Because it's New York.  It's something different. 
[00:42:00]  I don't think, like, the cold weather is necessarily a problem.  Maybe it is for, like, the thousands of celebrities that they give tickets to.  But, like, when you think about it, like, there's a game possibly being played two weeks  before that in New York.  You know, if the Giants are in the playoffs.  It's not that big of a deal for fans to watch a game in the cold.  Right.  You know?  But, like, they have no idea what they're going to do about a halftime show.  Like, no idea.  Why?  Because it could be too cold for all of that equipment. 
[00:42:30]  How about ONA throwing some t-shirts out?  Yeah, you can do that.  Fuck it A, man.  To the crowd.  Fuck it A.  Oh, we're working on that.  We heard you mention it.  We're going to work on that.  Like, all of this equipment that they bring onto the field has to be brought on, you know.  It's all so carefully organized that it has to be brought on at a certain time, brought  off at a certain time.  Everything has to be a certain temperature.  You know, like, in here, like, things have to be certain temperatures for this equipment  to work.  They have no...  Do you have to do the halftime show at the Izod Center next door? 
[00:43:00]  They might.  I mean, they have no idea what they're going to do for halftime.  I got the halftime show.  Marching band doing the fucking old school video games.  Oh, man.  Who did not enjoy that video?  That's a good one.  You do that for the Super Bowl, people are all in, man.  I think you're right.  Fucking the Tetris thing?  Holy fuck, how did they figure that out?  Come on.  How do you play and then figure out, I got to be the L-shape in the Tetris fucking part  of the halftime show?  Amazing. 
[00:43:30]  Which one?  They did Space Invaders, too, right?  Oh, that's great.  Can you put this up on our Facebook page?  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Yeah, look at that.  I've always been amazed when the marching band makes a little shape.  That's fucking Space Invaders.  Yeah, they just said Space Invaders.  That's amazing.  Marching band.  This fucking guy that filmed this.  Will you just show the field, you idiot?  One shot.  What's he doing? 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  And then what is that now?  Pokemon.  That's Pokemon.  Those are Pokeballs.  That's fucking amazing.  You've never seen this?  CGI.  It's totally fake.  Sorry about that.  I've never seen this, no.  You've never seen this?  It's amazing.  I like the news.  Now they're moving into another fucking video game.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's Pokemon again.  They're still doing the Pokemon.  Pikachu.  Pikachu they just made.  The place is losing their fucking minds. 
[00:44:30]  Did you say Pikachu?  I heard you say Pikachu.  To this day I hear that every time I see him on TV.  Fuck Ben Stein.  Me too.  Fuck him in the ass.  Oh, ow.  All right.  Now they're moving into something else.  Oh, man.  What do we got now?  That's some coordination right there.  And they're playing the whole time on top of it.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Tetris.  Watch, though. 
[00:45:00]  It starts moving down.  Holy shit.  And they move in position.  The place is losing their fucking minds.  That's some crazy shit right there.  Look at the amount of practice this took.  Right.  Unbelievable.  And then, bam.  They got the Tetris piece in the right place, and that makes the whole marching band split up again.  How do they know where to be?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's fucking insane.  Now, which one is this? 
[00:45:30]  The guy has to zoom in.  What are you doing?  You don't zoom in.  You can't see.  What a dummy.  It's not about zooming in.  Oh, what's?  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  It's Mario in the question mark boxes.  Yes.  And somebody's jumping and hitting him.  Yes.  Wow.  How fucked up is that?  It goes on forever.  It certainly does.  How long is this?  It's pretty amazing.  Oh, my God.  A star?  It's an invincible star. 
[00:46:00]  That's pretty fucking amazing.  That's cool.  I think so.  I gotta give it to him.  It's the whole halftime show.  It's like 10 minutes.  They keep going for like 10 minutes.  I never got to this part of the video, by the way.  I thought it was a really cool video, and then I saw the Tetris thing.  I'm like, all right, I'm good.  How do you coordinate that?  I'm good.  I don't need to see anything else.  You can play Trumpets in the cold, right?  Sure.  Oh, my God.  Things freeze up.  Your spit gets in there, and it freezes up on you.  Can't move it.  I think you're looking at the halftime show right here.  I really know.  They just made Mario.  That would go over like crazy. 
[00:46:30]  Better than Beyonce.  Yeah.  Better than Beyonce.  And it doesn't use a lot of electricity.  No.  Not much at all, actually.  Maybe none.  As long as everybody's playing their horns at the same time.  Yes.  It's loud enough.  Yeah.  What is that?  What is that?  That's like a thing.  It's old school, though.  Right, right, right, right.  Oh, it's a thing?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm in the band.  We all understand that.  Yeah.  Every halftime show used to be just a marching band that would come out.  The beauty of this radio show, you ask a question, and there's someone to answer it for you. 
[00:47:00]  Get an answer.  We got a guy that used to be in a marching band.  Oh.  He's going to explain this shit.  Mike, how the fuck do you do this?  Mike?  Basically, when I was in high school, I was in a marching band for three years.  You go to band camp, but you have a football field, and there's hash marks all over the  football field, and you just use them as markers, but you're given a sheet with all  the formations that you have to be in, and so you're, I forget what the hell the guy's 
[00:47:30]  name is, the instructor or whatever's up on scaffolding, and he kind of just guides  you.  You know, if you go from each formation to the next, he'll tell you, oh, you got to  move, you know, this whole group, circle around this area, and, I mean, you do it non-stop  for about two weeks every day when you're at band camp, so we wake up at, like, six in  the morning, you go on the field, you march for about an hour, then you go to breakfast,  you have, like, an hour break, and you go back, and you do it again. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, the worst part about it is just trying to remember the music, because you have to  remember all the music note for note, and then learn the formations on top of it.  So, it's all about the individual like you.  All right, I know I have to be just south of the 40-yard line.  Oh, Jesus.  On this hashtag.  And then I have to march down to the 30.  Right.  On that hash mark.  Hash mark, right.  Oh, my God, that sounds like a pain in the ass.  Everybody's got to remember their white hats, because if one guy's not wearing his white 
[00:48:30]  hat, he's not going to show up.  Doesn't make you stupid.  Yeah, it doesn't make it a good viewing experience for the people in the stands.  Well, sometimes, you know, you get lucky, and you get next to a real geek.  Do you?  You just got to make sure.  Jesus.  His big fucking moment.  You marching band dork.  Really?  Dork.  Exactly.  That's not nice.  What a quay.  That's not nice.  Don't call him a dork.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I regret it.  Queeb?  He's a queeb.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  Halo.  Halo.  Halo logo, and it says Halo.  How cool is that?  They're up to the Halo.  I'd be so pissed if I was on the other side, where everything's upside down.  Upside down, right?  It's one side of the stadium's getting all this.  Why didn't they alternate?  Yeah, why didn't they just kind of do the old rotation thing?  Yeah, now they do it for the other side of the stadium, but no.  Right.  Well, you got four fucking sides.  How about you take care of the other sides?  What is that?  Zelda?  Zelda.  Yeah, that is.  Slash Illuminati. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, man.  Really?  Is that what's going on with that?  There's some Illuminati shit in there, too.  Big fan of the Illuminati.  Wow, man.  You have a fucking horse.  You have a follow on Twitter and everything.  Oh, good.  Shit, that's crazy.  They're really cool.  Look, there's a horse now.  Whoa!  Oh, my God.  That's fucked up.  That's awesome.  The horse is moving like a horse does in slow motion across the field.  And its legs are moving.  And that's how a horse fucking runs.  That's so cool.  The legs are running.  That is fucked up.  All right, I'm still in.  I have. 
[00:50:00]  How the fuck did they do that?  It's rearing up now.  Holy shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  They're like little ants.  Let's look at marching band videos today.  That's our whole thing for the day.  Should it be marching band video day?  Yeah.  You rock.  All right, that was pretty fucking extravagant right there.  That was amazing.  How they do this.  Now they're moving into something else.  I know we had that thrilling mic that called up and told us how it's done, but I'm still amazed. 
[00:50:30]  It's up on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  So you can see what we're looking at here.  A marching band this good is going to make people leave the game like, yeah, I saw the game, but you see that marching band?  Yes.  Like all the football players are like, we're here too.  No one would even give a shit about like, this Beyonce thing.  No.  This is huge.  Maybe we care about the teams playing.  No.  Oh, yeah.  There's a castle with the fucking flag.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, is someone going to jump on the flag?  Isn't that how all the flags going down?  Isn't that how all the E-Rox videos ended?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're ripping you off.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  Nice.  This was at Ohio State University.  There it is.  The fireworks go off.  And I guess that's the grand finale.  That's pretty cool.  I would have closed with the horse.  You got to close with the horse.  That was the best part.  Absolutely.  Quite amazing.  But that's the end of the game. 
[00:51:30]  What do you mean?  Like, you close with that because that's how the game ends.  It's the end of the level.  No one's going to stick around for a marching band after the game's over.  No.  That's the video game.  Oh.  Are they still doing something?  Oh.  Or like somebody would say, oh, E-Rox video's over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rox.  So true.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh.  What's going on now?  Pac-Man.  It's not over.  Oh, it's going to move now.  Now that Pac-Man's moving, the ghost is chasing Pac-Man. 
[00:52:00]  Let's go, Pac-Man.  Pac-Man's going for the power pill right there.  The cherry.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  He's not going to make it.  Oh, he didn't make it.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I shouldn't have that happen.  Game over.  Game over.  And they just, the band spells out the game over.  It's amazing how they do that.  That's sad.  They don't even let Pac-Man win.  You know what the goof would have been?  I know.  The goof would have been to do Pong.  Yeah.  For the whole time. 
[00:52:30]  Just have one guy running from side of the field to side of the field until he collapses.  This guy says, you got to check.  Well, Chris, go ahead in Florida.  Go ahead.  Hey, you got to check out the black schools.  Oh, yeah?  The formations aren't that good, but the dancing is off the track.  Just bring it on?  Well, we're looking at the, you know, long-distance looking at them. 
[00:53:00]  It's already been brought in.  We know that they can, you know, dance on the field.  Yeah, we need a specific video.  Like, this guy is telling us we need to see a specific video.  His name is John.  He's in Mobile, Alabama.  He's talking about stomping the yard.  John.  There's a black school called the University of North Alabama.  Those son of a bitch get down on that field, buddy.  I'm telling you.  You got to watch one of those videos on YouTube.  It's another one of these guys with one of those videos. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  We need specific videos.  This guy, University of North Alabama on YouTube.  They got a bunch of them on there.  All right.  Well, it is marching band video day.  No, it's not.  All right.  Thank you, John.  They're out there on the field.  I'm telling you.  All right.  Right on.  Oh, man.  It's incredible.  These are the Clovers.  They're a high school cheerleading group.  Oh.  I don't know.  I like the other team better.  You do?  Yeah.  Why? 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  Did the other team steal most of their shit from the Clovers?  I don't care.  They were more attractive than the other team.  Dan, the Clovers rule.  See?  I like the Clovers.  Clovers could be on my bus.  They're a low-income school.  That's all right.  They get the best pot.  How did they get the money to get in the big competition?  They had to raise it.  Really?  Yeah.  It's tough for them.  I bet it was.  Why do you guys know so much about this movie?  Movie?  What?  Movie.  It's a fucking... 
[00:54:30]  Gabrielle Union.  It's your old school.  Yeah.  Fucking Biden rules.  Telling everyone to get a shotgun and fucking just shoot it in the air.  He said I'm the...  Holy fucking rules.  He's telling gun owners he's the best friend they've had in 35 years.  He rules.  He's delusional.  Yeah.  Just get yourself a shotgun and blast a couple of rounds off your patio.  He tells his wife that.  Yeah.  I told her to just go outside the patio, blast a few rounds off, and you'll hear anyone. 
[00:55:00]  Why is anyone accepting what he's saying?  That's crazy.  You can't have a vice president just telling people to get a fucking shotgun and blast it  from their porch.  And if they hear something, you go out to the porch and just fire a few rounds.  He's out of his mind.  I fucking love him.  He is out of his fucking mind.  I fucking love Biden.  He could be the greatest vice president ever.  I challenge you to come up with a better one.  He is a kook.  He just says whatever the fuck he wants.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  I don't know if he could just tell people to get a shotgun and fire blasts off from your  porch.  Get a shotgun.  Just get a shotgun.  And I told my wife.  What a crotchet.  I love him.  Because he really believes everyone's there for him always.  Oh, yeah.  Even if Obama's in the room.  Yeah.  If Obama's in the room, he still thinks, nope, they're here to see me, motherfucker.  A couple of blasts from a shotgun will scare off intruders.  Buy a shotgun.  Buy a shotgun.  The vice president encouraged people worried about defending themselves. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  What's going on?  You think they're going to release, what's his name there?  Pistorius?  Is that how you say his name?  Bail hearing?  Yeah.  Is he a flight risk, though?  Really?  Come on.  I don't know.  Where's he going?  The evidence is pretty strong.  If they keep his spatulas locked up, he ain't going nowhere.  That's all they got to do.  So, you know, he's trying to say.  I'm pretty sure you'd know if he's flying.  Yeah.  He's the guy with two legs that are fake.  Yeah, the fake legs guy.  But you hear the latest? 
[00:56:30]  Like, he's trying to say he shot through that bathroom door.  Yeah.  And then they're like, well, then how do the show casings end up in the bathroom?  And they're trying to figure that one out now.  Well, when I opened the door finally and walked in, it was on my foot.  Right.  I kicked him in there.  Yeah.  Could you find me just cool Biden shit today?  Maybe we can make it Joe Biden Day.  Get a double barrel shotgun.  He's talking about, like, you know, getting an old school hunting shotgun.  I don't feel like arguing gun control today. 
[00:57:00]  I just like the silliness of Biden.  I love it.  Thinking that'll just solve everything.  Guys, I'm not.  Just get a double barrel shotgun.  We live in New York City.  I don't think I could do that.  I'm not even allowed to.  You're not allowed to.  You need to get a permit for a shotgun.  Yeah.  Double barrel fired off the fucking patio.  You got that clip?  It's great.  It's in this story.  We have to listen to this.  Stephanofel.  George Snuffelofocus.  Snuffelofocus. 
[00:57:30]  Yes, he's the biggest bore.  But that ABC, man, Good Morning America is doing really well.  Gotta love him.  They got a good team together, I guess.  But I've always found this guy to be a complete bore.  You don't like George Stephanofocus?  Oh, God, no.  God, no.  The Greek community loves him.  Oh, is he Greek?  He's a Greek.  Of course he is.  He's a Greek.  With a name like that.  You think he likes feta and watermelon?  And that fucking Greek yogurt.  Last time we saw Roland, he was all happy about his watermelon and feta. 
[00:58:00]  He was talking about that yesterday.  I don't think he's going to be talking about watermelon and feta today.  He's going to be talking about us fucking turning down GL.  Before he started pitching guests.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Roland with the pitch and a swing and a miss.  He doesn't like striking out.  No, he doesn't.  He really doesn't.  And he takes it out on the hitters.  Yes, he does.  Yeah, but at least he has you now.  You'll take anybody and anything.  So that's great.  And it's part of our show, technically.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like almost a fifth hour at this point. 
[00:58:30]  It's the dumping ground.  Yeah, so he's still getting his guests booked.  I guess.  Your dumps are pretty good, though.  Ah, well, Loverboy.  Remember Loverboy.  Just take every single guest.  It's good for you.  I enjoyed the Loverboy.  It's all right, Jake.  I enjoyed the Loverboy interview.  I know you did.  You called him a nice red pants faggy.  I was quite a dick to the Loverboys.  They deserve it.  I got them to play working for the weekend, though.  They didn't want to.  I know.  That was cool as fuck. 
[00:59:00]  Come on.  Work for the weekend.  That's what we're doing right now.  You're not working.  Okay.  We get it.  Are you ever snuffling up, I guess?  Yeah, let's hear her.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Here's a side of Joe Biden you don't see every day.  Buy a shotgun.  Buy a shotgun.  He wasn't doing a commercial for his favorite gun shop.  He was responding to online questions from Parents Magazine.  And he seemed to get a little rattled when some of the questions came from people 
[00:59:30]  unhappy with the president's gun proposals.  Do you believe that banning certain weapons in high-capacity magazines...  What the hell is that?  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  But I'm Dan.  Dude, that just made me laugh like a fucking girl.  What the hell is that?  That's a dude?  Yeah.  He's being interviewed by a man who's sitting there.  He's one of those, uh...  One of those, like, Jay Leno kids. 
[01:00:00]  Jay Leno had...  He's all I could think about.  Jerry!  He's all I could think about.  Jay Leno had one of those.  A high talker.  Who, Ross?  Yeah, yeah.  He's in that genre.  The Ross genre.  What is that?  I don't know.  That was the weirdest thing.  What is that?  Let me hear that again.  I gotta hear that, dude.  God, we find nuggets every once in a while.  Hold on.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back a little. 
[01:00:30]  Be with the president's gun proposals.  Do you believe that banning certain weapons in high-capacity magazines...  It's a guy.  And he looks like a guy.  It's not like a very femmy-looking guy.  In this stupid world we live in, are we allowed to laugh at that?  Or are we gotta make-believe that's not a little different and silly?  It's hilarious.  I would laugh at it.  Of course you would laugh at that.  What is that?  His balls didn't drop yet?  Jerry!  I know. 
[01:01:00]  And I'm Dan!  Oh my god.  Can't it take testosterone or something for that?  Yeah, it would be difficult to grow up with.  That voice.  Wow.  You know what?  Every fucking time that guy uses the phone.  Yes, miss?  Of course.  Yes, ma'am.  Oh, ma'am?  Yes.  Or he'll get through a whole conversation like, oh, it didn't happen, and at the end, alright,  thanks, ma'am.  Yeah.  Fuck, I still sound like a chick.  Oh, man.  Wow. 
[01:01:30]  Let's see this again.  Who is he?  Something like, you know, where they have to do those dumb fucking interviews every once  in a while?  Yeah.  Someone who gives a fuck magazine or website?  Parents magazine or whatever.  Yeah.  Be with the president's gun proposals.  Do you believe that banning certain weapons in high-capacity magazines will mean that law-abiding  citizens will then become more of a target to criminals, as we will have no way to sufficiently  protect ourselves?  Is this a sentiment that came up again?  You see the look Biden gave?  Like, holy fuck.  Because you know he wants to say something. 
[01:02:00]  He's that guy.  Well, you sissy.  Right.  He's that guy.  He's that guy.  When he's not in office, he's that guy.  What's with your voice?  You sound like a girl.  He gives a look toward the camera like, anyone else?  Yeah.  Picking up on this funny voice.  Picking up on this fucking funny voice guy.  You got a funny voice.  He just says shit.  He's like the grandpa that doesn't know what not to say.  That's beautiful.  Let's protect yourselves.  Is this a sentiment that came up again and again?  Is this Parents Magazine?  It is.  I have Parents Magazine at my home. 
[01:02:30]  I've never heard anybody in Parents Magazine ask these kinds of questions.  What's your name?  He will never be a parent.  So why is he working for Parent Magazine?  You don't think this guy will be a parent?  Oh.  No.  I think everyone alive would be way too confused.  Yeah.  It's not a gay thing.  I think even the gays would probably go, what is this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  Yeah.  We can't label this.  Yeah.  He's in that fucking... 
[01:03:00]  He's just in a void.  Very androgynous right there.  You don't know what it is.  A child.  Daddy, why do you sound like that?  Yeah.  What are you?  Now I'm waiting to hear the name.  Do you think he's got a big, huge fucking piece or is it like...  Oh, no.  That's a little tiny...  Or is it one of these baby penis people?  Yeah.  Infant...  Infantile?  Infantilism.  Whatever it's called.  Infantilism.  Infantilism.  What's phantilism?  I don't know.  No, it's something when you have a little dick.  Yeah.  And it's like handicap plates kind of little dick. 
[01:03:30]  Like you could actually say that you're handicapped.  That's what this guy's piece is looking like.  Oh, yeah.  Now we're almost a week out of the gay zone.  Micropenis.  Would it be gay if we looked up fucking micropenises right now?  Micropenis.  Yes.  It would be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We can't.  That would be gay.  Nothing with a penis.  We can't.  We're not allowed.  Even if it's a micropenis, isn't that more like a freak show thing?  We agreed.  A gay freak show.  That's it.  Yeah, but I think it's open for discussion.  I don't think it's a gay thing if it's a freak thing.  Now, how does a freak thing become a gay thing? 
[01:04:00]  Well, you know, you might be right because if we had Bobo in here right now and he took  his pants off, I wouldn't think it was a gay thing.  I wouldn't either.  Plus, that's the other thing.  You start looking at micropenises on the internet, you're upsetting Bobo and he's wondering  why wouldn't you just have me come in the studio?  I love you guys.  He doesn't want to come in the studio.  I'm going to call Friday.  Okay.  Shit.  Right.  You don't keep up with his tweets as much?  No.  I was thinking of Katie last night and I got sad.  Did you?  God.  It's exhausting. 
[01:04:30]  It really is.  So Bobo and his online girlfriend are over?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a shame.  He's moving on.  He's moving on.  He's talking to some other chick now.  Oh, he is.  Oh, yeah.  A chick.  A chick, yeah.  It's a real chick.  He's doing a Tao thing.  He's fucking out of his mind.  So we're not allowed to look at micropenises.  No.  I say no.  If you want a freak show, let's find some other area of the body.  What if it leads to micropenises?  Nope.  Too gay.  We got rid of the gay. 
[01:05:00]  Keep the gay out.  It's too gay.  Keep the gay out.  All right.  Let's go.  Guy from Paramagazine.  Kate, if you want to protect yourself...  Wait, wait, wait.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  I'm very fucking...  I think something's going on here.  I think that was the name of the person who wrote the question.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, it is.  He read some question.  Okay.  Let's go back a little bit.  And that's why he's looking at the camera now, because he thinks she's out there somewhere.  Let's go back a little.  Okay.  He can ask these kinds of questions. 
[01:05:30]  What's her name?  Kate.  Kate.  Her name is Kate.  Her name, yeah.  Noreen.  Noreen.  If you want to protect yourself, get a double-barrel shotgun.  Nice.  Have the shells, a 12-gauge shotgun.  Nice.  The vice president said that is exactly what he told his wife to do.  He said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here or walk out,  put that double-barrel shotgun, and fired two blasts outside the house.  I promise you, who's ever coming in is not going to... 
[01:06:00]  You don't need an AR-15.  It's harder to aim.  It's harder to use.  And, in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.  That's the most irresponsible statement for a gun owner just to blast fucking indiscriminately  and hope they go away.  That is so irresponsible as a gun owner.  Are you saying that's more irresponsible than actually having an AR-15 and actually aiming  at your target, knowing where you're firing? 
[01:06:30]  The most important thing with a gun and owning a gun and using a gun is knowing exactly where  you're placing your rounds, not firing in the air.  What is this, a movie?  Are you sure?  Fire a warning shot.  That's the story of every person who shot one of their loved ones by mistake.  Surprise!  I just went to scare them.  Yeah.  That is insane, the vice president said.  That's why it's so great.  That's why it's so great. 
[01:07:00]  It's insane the vice president said that.  I love it.  Taking a nap and shot the mailman.  Yes!  He doesn't have a chance to be the president, right?  I don't think so.  He thinks he's going to run, though.  He thinks he's going to be the incoming vice president on the ticket in 2016, but I don't  think so.  Is there more to this?  A little bit.  I want to hear that guy's voice again.  It's points, Noreen.  Huh?  A man on gun control, but he has also repeatedly tried to show that he is a believer in the 
[01:07:30]  Second Amendment.  To another reader of Parents Magazine, he said, I have two shotguns at home.  Nobody is going to come and take my guns.  And, George, I have to say one more thing from all of us here in Washington.  Welcome back, Rob.  You're not trying to hear that shit.  Huh?  You're not trying to hear that shit.  Nah.  Fuck that.  She gets juice in my juice place, though.  She does?  She's a nice lady.  Robber, Robber. 
[01:08:00]  She's such a super lady.  The Obamas welcomed her back to good morning.  I wish her nothing but the best there, Sam Roberts.  She's fighting some cancer stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  She is a very good lady.  Yeah.  But you're just not trying to hear all that shit right now.  No, because it's just going to bum us out.  Right.  We're keeping it fun today.  Trying to hear about Joe Biden telling his wife to fire guns.  That's right.  Out of her window.  Just go out on the balcony and fucking fire them.  Remember that clip of Saddam they used to show all the time?  Right.  Where he walked onto the balcony, leveled the fucking gun, and just fired it a few times? 
[01:08:30]  That's Biden.  Yeah.  That's what he tells his wife to do.  Good old Biden.  How irresponsible.  Worked in Django.  Just start firing bullets.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  It's like when Marty was driving away from the farm.  Yes.  From the farm.  The Twin Pines, Lone Pine fucking farm.  Exactly.  I just got this tweet.  If guy you call Egghead had sunglasses on, he would look like Pitbull. 
[01:09:00]  Don't stop the pub.  That was the response I was hoping for, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Don't worry.  All right.  That was Bobo.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to call in Friday.  No.  No, you're not.  Well, he could call in.  Well, he could call and just wait on hold.  I got a new girl.  All right.  I'm heartbroken.  I can't believe Katie left me.  I'm heartbroken.  Oh, hello.  Who are you?  That's exactly what he did.  Finally over. 
[01:09:30]  We're still friends, so leave her alone.  We're still friends.  He's a player.  He's a player, yo.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we break?  Yeah.  We have nothing planned today.  It's kind of a nice feeling.  Yeah.  No guests.  Just.  No material.  I don't think.  Rocking and a rolling and whatnot.  I don't even think we have material today.  Yeah.  It's kind of a slow news day.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah, more or less.  I didn't even.  When I stay in the city, I don't get that listen to 1010 wins on the way in thing. 
[01:10:00]  To get what's going on.  So I'm kind of out in the cold here.  I don't know.  You got stuff like Donald Trump's Twitter was hacked.  You got.  It was?  You got the Oscars on Sunday.  But Oscar talk is just stupid.  Well, yeah.  Because I'm like, hey, what do you think is going to win Best Picture?  Well, I don't.  Like, why would that matter?  Tell that to Ben Lyons.  He'll be like, fuck you guys.  Ben Laden?  No, Ben Lyons was cool.  Ben Lyons.  He made it a little different. 
[01:10:30]  Oh.  But I didn't see all the movies.  So for me to just think what's going to win Best Picture is stupid.  Yeah.  Should be up to the people that have seen them all.  How many have you seen?  You've seen a lot of them though, right?  Nope.  Silver Lining Playbook.  That's it.  Even though I got Argo.  I thought you saw Argo.  Lincoln.  And I got Zero Dark Thirty at home.  I haven't been able to see any of them.  Wow.  Yeah.  I got three blockbusters sitting in my house and I can't fucking watch.  Roland's convinced Hugh Jackman is going to win Best Actor for Les Mis.  For Les Mis? 
[01:11:00]  To the point that he bet lunch on it.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I want some of that action.  You're getting a lunch.  I know.  That Lewis guy's going to win.  Lewis who?  Daniel.  Daniel Day.  Daniel Day.  DDL?  DDL's going to win it.  Everyone's saying it.  Of course he will.  But then Hollywood has to be fucking assholes and go, well, that's what you were expecting.  Really?  Watch what we do.  They'd like to do that shit.  Give it to Bradley Cooper or something.  I think it'd be tough not to give it to DDL.  Hugh Jackman.  Bradley Cooper?  The hangover guy?  Stop.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[01:11:30]  That ain't going to happen.  That ain't happening.  He's got to earn his keep.  Although he was a terrific actor in that movie.  He surprised the hell out of me.  See, now we're talking about the Oscars.  Now look what happened.  We talk about how we're not going to talk about something and then we start talking about it.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to figure out some shit.  Yep.  Stay there.  Everyone's watching to see what you will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh! 
[01:12:00]  Everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  Everyone's trying to get it right.  To get it right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Raised in the wilds of the Australian outback, a new breed of hunter exists in pursuit of the 
[01:12:30]  most elusive prey.  Vajorna.  Vajorna.  Anthony Dundee.  The Hyman Hunter.  You want to check for a busted hyman?  You're looking a vagina.  Out of the wilderness and into the crowded streets of Sydney looking for untouched teen  girls.  Let me see your hyman.  Is your hyman intact?  I believe your hyman ain't even intact.  Join Anthony Dundee.  The Hyman Hunter.  In his ongoing investigation.  Let me blow into a vagina.  I know.  You could hear the hyman.  Your fucking hyman's busted. 
[01:13:00]  Will he ever find the tight teen snatch?  Crikey.  There's probably a giant penis cracked open your hyman.  I bet she was blowing bush oyster all over the place.  Yeah.

[01:15:00]  We can make it Radiohead Day.  That can be fun.  That might be a little too eclectic for some.  I figured I'd give you something so you could do it again like yesterday.  We'll have two hits and then a bunch of obscure shit.  I don't know about that.  In the eye.  I went and saw Radiohead and it was like, you know, just colon everything.  You go, oh, I'm seeing Radiohead.  And then you're just kind of like, ow.  This guy's such a prick.  He won't ever play his hits.  It's going to piss off the Radiohead fans. 
[01:15:30]  I consider myself one to a point.  But he is one of those guys that's too cool for the room.  He's one of those bands that are too cool for the room.  He's sick of playing Creep so he doesn't play it anymore.  Well, sorry.  What the fuck, man?  Yeah.  Just give the people what they want.  Where were we for that show?  Because I was at that show as well.  Roseland.  Yeah.  If he broke in a creep, that place would have fucking ripped the roof off.  Exactly.  And he knows that.  Yup. 
[01:16:00]  And still doesn't do it.  Doesn't matter.  It's only three minutes.  Three and a half minutes.  Yeah.  Give a little something to the people that came with the big fans.  Like, there's the Radiohead fans that went to the show.  Right.  And then they bring a friend with them.  Right.  Who was like, who, Radiohead?  Oh, yeah.  They do that fucking creep song.  Right.  And then the other one.  Karma police.  Karma police.  Yeah.  Karma police.  And remember, we were just standing there for probably two to three minutes with Scarlett  Johansson in a little circle. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  And we had nothing to say to her.  It's just like, oh, God.  I was just staring at her tits.  Of course.  Huh?  Yeah.  She was with Ryan Reynolds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Ryan Reynolds happened to be in studio, I don't know, the day before the Radiohead show.  Something like that.  So then we see him.  And he remembered us.  Yeah.  And some of you would say, of course he would remember you.  He just did your show.  No, you don't understand.  There's times we talk to these celebrities and we'll see them in the hall after we're done  and they don't remember us.  Yeah.  That's how forgettable we are at times. 
[01:17:00]  But he remembered.  And he brought over Scarlett Johansson.  And we're all just kind of chit-chatting.  Small talk.  Looking at her tits.  And I think he didn't want anyone to really know that he was there with her at the time.  Even though everyone knew.  And then I wound up the rest of the show hanging out with Edward Norton.  Yes, you did.  Yes.  The lovely and talented Edward Norton.  She's running at that. 
[01:17:30]  Baby's got the Benz.  Oh, yeah.  I don't even think he played anything off the Benz.  Karma police.  I like karma police.  Played some karma police.  20 years ago.  Is that what they're saying? 
[01:18:00]  For Pablo Honey.  20 years ago, Pablo Honey was released.  So that Creep song is 20 years old?  That song is 20 years old?  That's impossible.  Yeah.  Wow.  Fuck.  What year would that be?  That would be 93?  93.  I like to do this dumb game.  So in 93, 20 years before that was 73.  Wow.  Holy shit.  So right now, as much time has passed as when that came out.  Right.  1973.  Right.  Exactly.  How fucked up is that? 
[01:18:30]  That's pretty fucking crazy.  Just think that.  What was 1973 like?  Well, I was quite young in 73.  What?  How young?  Very.  Why don't you tell us what that weight is like?  It's almost a ton.  It's almost a ton.  Just shy.  Literally.  27 pounds away.  You can do it, Iraq.  73, Iraq was very tumultuous. 
[01:19:00]  Vietnam was winding down, but definitely still on people's minds.  Would you watch a documentary?  Was it that gas shortage everyone talked about?  No, that was more 75, I think.  It's a little older than me.  Around there.  He's a little older.  You don't...  I don't remember any of this.  You remember the 70s at all?  Not really.  Way too young, right?  Way too young.  I see.  I do remember.  I remember for my eighth birthday party, it was like a disco theme. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, that's cute.  Because disco was just about on its way out.  That's cute.  79, right?  You turned eight in 1979?  Yeah, yeah.  That's about right.  More of the 60s, like, is the question.  There was a point in time...  No clue, huh?  No idea.  There was a quick point in time where it actually struck me that if this continued, I might have  to go to Vietnam.  Shut up.  I swear.  What are you...  Like...  Are you a lot older than me?  No, but I fall into that weird area. 
[01:20:00]  I know you'll admit to a couple years older than me.  Yeah.  But I'm starting to wonder.  No, no.  But I remember vividly a lot of things, so that also...  Because we got our bit, but then there's times where I'm like, I swear he's talking about  something I have no concept about.  So then I'm starting to think you might be four or five years older than me.  Have you petted your age all these years?  No, I have not.  So your age is your age?  My age is my age. 
[01:20:30]  But why is that two-year difference that much?  It's because I remember so vividly everything.  You know what, though?  Yeah.  I know why.  Yeah.  There's no joke here.  It's a real thought.  Yeah.  You were allowed to grow up a lot faster than I was.  Well, that's true.  That's what this is all about.  Yeah, that is kind of true, I guess.  Like, my dad wasn't getting me broads at...  How old were you, 13?  Yeah.  There was not even a thought that my dad was going to bring a broad home for me at 13 years old. 
[01:21:00]  I was excited to get a brand new 10-speed bike at 13.  Ooh.  Dad got me something else to ride.  Oh, yeah.  But you...  Yeet.  And when was the first time you shot a gun?  Oh, man.  Fucking probably 10.  Okay.  I was about...  I would say 12.  Yeah.  I'm relating to you.  Yeah.  And they got me somebody, like my grandma or an uncle or something, got me a dumb, like, fake rifle. 
[01:21:30]  It was a fake rifle that you load rubber bands onto.  Rubber bands.  And you kind of turn back the little thing.  The little wooden thing.  And then it gave you about five or six rubber band shots.  Yep.  And I shot it once, hit one of my brothers.  He started crying or something.  And that was it.  And that was it.  But it was a rubber band gun, and you're shooting real guns.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See, that's why, when you bring up some of this stuff, you were able to, like, just grow  up a lot faster than me.  Yeah, when I was 13.  We were held back in my family. 
[01:22:00]  I got my first pistol that I owned.  At 13?  That my dad got me for my birthday at 13.  Holy fuck, man.  Yeah.  Get me a broad and a gun.  My mom.  He really didn't want me to turn out to, as he said, be a faggot.  A queeb?  So he figured, I best get my son a chick and a gun.  So he mans up.  When was the first time you actually drank drank?  Drank drank?  I think, again, the magic number is 13.  I was at least 15, maybe 16. 
[01:22:30]  I had sips here and there, that dumb shit, where you take a sip of your uncle's beers.  But an actual drink drink, I think I was 16.  By 13, I was allowed to go into the cooler and grab a can of Bud.  At what age?  A Bud, Coors.  And 13.  That was allowed.  We were at the ranch, and there was a bunch of guys hanging out and everything.  I was allowed to, just without even asking, open up, grab a Coors.  I can't even tell you how amazing that is to me. 
[01:23:00]  Because I remember the shit we were allowed and not allowed to do at 13.  There was that first, like, when you first start drinking beer, there was that buzz you got from drinking one can of beer at 13 that you cannot fucking ever recapture.  You've been chasing that ever since, though.  It's such a great buzz.  You just down that fucking can of beer, and you're just like, wow, I am fucking, like, feeling good.  When did you lose your virginity?  Uh, that would be 13. 
[01:23:30]  13 was my big fucking, that was my year.  Yeah, that was my big year.  18 for me.  Wow.  College.  Not even, not even, uh, 18 high school.  Yeah.  It was 18 college.  Wow.  Fuck, yeah.  We weren't even allowed to bring girls around or anything.  No.  Fucking strict household.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Wanted to.  Of course.  Wanted to.  Who wouldn't?  But didn't.  Who wouldn't?  And then, uh, first time you smoked pot.  That was later. 
[01:24:00]  Because, uh, I was, uh, I was pretty dead set against the weed.  Um, and then I was out in California with my dad, and he was not fucking hearing anything  about pot.  Yeah.  And then my brother got sent out there to California for a little discipline.  Wait, your dad wasn't into the pot?  Oh, no.  Why?  What was that about?  Because he's like a fucking redneck kind of, you know, only hippies smoke that marijuana  shit.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh...  Yeah, but he was like kind of a cowboy, a ranch. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that shit.  Seemed perfect for pot.  No.  Your brother thought so.  Well, he went out there and said this is perfect for pot.  Well, that didn't work out very well when my dad caught Joe at weed.  It was that whole, you know, we don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee, you know?  And, um, it turned out, uh, my brother got sent out to California because he was, um, you  know, kind of, uh, fucking up here in New York, as far as my mom was concerned. 
[01:25:00]  So, um, he came out and he got caught with weed.  My father saw, like, a bulge in Joe's sock.  It wasn't his dick.  It was some Marahoochee.  And, uh, he's like, what's...  Why would he hide it better?  Ah, it's Joe.  He goes, uh, what's that?  And Joe goes, nothing.  What are you talking about?  I go, what's that?  And he reaches over and fucking grabs it.  It was weed.  Was that bad?  Yeah.  What happened to Joe?  I don't know.  He probably got slapped around a little bit.  A little bit, huh?  Yeah, that'll happen.  A little bit.  I got slapped around for stealing quarters.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  In Muskogee.  How do you know this?  Who did this?  I don't know.  Merle Haggard.  Merle Haggard?  Trips on LSD.  This was in Platoon, right?  Yeah, this is a fucking jam.  All right.  Yeah, so, uh, dad wasn't really, you know, too hip to that.  But, when Joe came out, uh, he turned me onto the weed and completely changed my life forever. 
[01:26:00]  You're going to tell that great story.  I was doing pretty good in school, you know.  I was doing all right.  Uh, responsibility.  I was pretty responsible as far as, you know, making sure my horse was taken care of and the corral was cleaned and things like, you know, that I was responsible for.  Once I started smoking weed, that shit went out the window until my fucking, you know, thirties.  I spent all that time smoking pot and doing nothing.  Didn't your dad know? 
[01:26:30]  That I was smoking weed?  Yeah.  Nah, I kept it from him pretty well.  Really?  Because, uh, yeah.  Yeah, but he saw your chores, like, falling off.  Well, yeah, that would have made him feel pretty bad.  Yeah?  Yeah, so I didn't want to, you know, let him know I was smoking the wacky tabacky.  Mmm.  But, uh, me and Joe would fucking, we would smoke some pot, man.  Fuck.  Which was fun, you know.  Smoking with Joe.  And what age?  15?  That was about 15, I guess.  Yeah, something like that. 
[01:27:00]  Sure.  And I was 18 for that as well.  18 for the weed.  And not 18 high school.  Yeah.  18 college.  You understand the theme here?  Yeah.  Got out of my mom's grips, mostly.  And then fucking, fucking had some good times, finally.  Able to.  Picked a college 400 miles away.  That was on purpose, too.  Able to tear it up at some fucking mac and cheese dinner parties.  There you go.  Finally tear it up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:27:30]  The fear of being fucking basically killed if that shit was going on around our house.  Yeah, there were some things that, you know, my pops was not going to allow.  It wasn't like he allowed everything.  And that's weird to say, because when I tell a lot of stories, it sounds like he just, like, let anything happen.  No, the pot thing's a big one.  Pot was huge.  You would think if he's kind of a partying guy that he'd be around that.  And apparently stealing quarters to buy ice cream sandwiches.  Was a no-no.  Was a no-no.  Boy, that ice cream sandwich thing has just been chasing me through my life. 
[01:28:00]  I love ice cream sandwiches.  I love them.  Oh, my God.  I stole the quarters.  I bought the ice cream sandwiches.  And then my dad fucking smacked me in the face a few times.  Right.  Because I stole the quarters.  Right.  And then earlier in my childhood when I was on Long Island, you remember my Uncle Joe had bought the ice cream sandwiches.  We ate them all.  Left the box in the freezer.  He was all high and wanted some ice cream sandwiches.  He grabbed the box, saw that it was empty, ran into the living room where we were all sitting, threw the box at us, and said, 
[01:28:30]  You bummers.  Was that your father's brother?  No, it was my mother's brother.  Is that the guy I met once?  Uncle Joe.  Yeah, yeah.  The guitar builder.  Fucking cool as hell.  Where is he?  Do you see that guy?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Thomas said hi.  He's great.  He came in with his homemade guitars one day.  Dude, if you go to Giselle, I guess, Giselle Guitars.  Yeah.  Google it.  He builds.  He's a guitar builder.  He's still hand-making guitars?  Oh, fuck yeah.  They're amazing.  This guy was cool as fuck, man. 
[01:29:00]  Exotic voice.  He's an old-school hippie.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like an old-school hippie, right?  He definitely used to be a hippie.  He's a lot more conservative these days.  Conservative.  Yeah, you'd be surprised.  It changed his tune a little bit.  What getting older does to you.  A lot of the hippies changed their tune.  Oh, my God.  It's a J-E-S-S-E-L-L-I.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Sam, you don't know how to spell that word.  Yeah, yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah, there they are.  What does this have to do with radio?  Isn't that amazing? 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  He made that?  Yeah, he fucking makes amazing guitars.  Giselle Guitars.  J-E-S-S-E-L-L-I.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing.  Put it in the Google search,  because he's got some dashes and shit on his website.  He sold some to some fucking big name.  Keith Richards has one.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  He made a guitar for Keith Richards?  Yeah.  You fucking, like, people seek these out.  They're works of art you can play. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know much about guitars and music.  As far as, like, this shit goes,  I know how to play them on the radio.  Some cool tunes.  That's amazing looking.  It's artwork.  It really is.  Here, pop up another one.  Yeah, you know,  yeah, fucking, uh, quite, quite cool indeed.  Holy fuck.  How long has it taken to make one of these?  It takes quite a while.  That looks like an old school blues, uh, guitar.  Yeah.  And all that shit is like ivory,  mother of pearl, 
[01:30:30]  it's fucking...  How many can he make a year?  Um, I really don't know.  I need to know now.  I really don't know.  My brother's got one.  Does he like it?  Yeah.  Does it sound good?  Yeah.  They fucking are completely amazingly playable.  How the fuck did he figure this out?  I don't understand how people figure shit out.  When he was, like, uh, living, uh, downstairs from us, uh, during the You Bummers days,  uh, he was, like, into wood carving.  And he would carve, like, these wooden whales and shit like that when he would get hot.  How do you do that? 
[01:31:00]  Him and Ant Pat.  What?  Ant Pat.  One fucking miscarve and the whole thing's fucked up.  I know.  Or do you turn it into another animal at that point?  I don't know how he did it.  But he was, he was already doing that.  Yeah.  He would get, what, a block of wood?  Yeah, a block of wood and carve some shit and then you'd just smell weed in the, in the,  downstairs.  Just so much pot.  He would have pot parties and, and I would look through the little slot, like, between  this, like, um, kind of frosted glass thing that went between our kitchen and his apartment.  Right. 
[01:31:30]  It was like this thing, but they put some kind of frosted glass.  Did you get to see nude girls?  Well, that's what I was looking for.  Of course.  And then one day they got a party and I'm, I'm peeking in and I had the light on behind  me.  So all they saw was my silhouette looking.  They knew I was looking.  And so, uh, as I was looking, all I saw was this big lump of clay go right in the eye  hole.  I was looking in.  Yeah.  What an asshole.  It would have been funny if like some girl barely fucking clothes, opens the door and  calls you a pervert and slams the door in your face. 
[01:32:00]  I'd have had a boner.  I'd have gotten a boner.  One of those ragers.  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, the ice cream sandwiches.  So now, uh, I find myself like at two 30 in the morning, uh, the other night I was like,  fuck it.  I'm going to have an ice cream sandwich at two 30 in the morning.  And I did.  Wow.  I did.  It's insane.  Feeling all right.  It's fucking insane.  Knowing what you do.  That's just crazy that you would do a fucking ice cream sandwich at two 30 in the morning. 
[01:32:30]  There's something about ice cream sandwiches.  I got to tell you, these guitars though.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  They're pretty, uh, outstanding.  I think we might've just sold them a couple.  Uh, I don't know.  Yeah.  I sold a couple for him because that is, you're right.  That's like a piece of art.  It's beautiful looking.  Yeah.  He's a rip man.  We give him like a Thanksgiving and Christmas and shit when I see the family and he's an old  guy.  He's there.  He doesn't look old or act old or anything either.  He's got to be up there.  Right.  He's up there.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Very cool.  Yeah.  It's, uh, I think he got kicked out of John Glenn high school because his hair was too  long and it was literally like the first, like time you saw a picture of the Beatles.  Right.  That kind of long.  And he refused to cut it.  Yeah.  I'm not cutting my hair.  Yeah.  And of course my grandfather's like, cut your hair, you fucking faggot.  All right.  I don't know what this has to do with Radiohead.  I don't know.  We kind of, uh, took a turn.  Pablo Honey's 20 years old today.  That's crazy. 
[01:33:30]  What other, uh, songs were off that one?  You had the creep.  Then you hear me.  Uh, 20.  Oh, cause we went to 1973 and I was saying that I was, uh, I was starting to think that  I might have to go to Vietnam.  I was 12 or something.  All right.  So I started getting me thinking that like the war was going on still.  And I'm like, uh, oh, if I get a few years older, you were anxious as a kid, huh?  I, yes, I was very anxious. 
[01:34:00]  This was the song playing in your head growing up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause I, I, I was watching the news and I'd see fucking, you know, soldiers and death  and destruction.  Right.  And then I'm realizing like, all right, 18, you get drafted.  Right.  And I'm 12.  You know, that's six fucking years.  Right.  And this war has been going on for a while.  Who's to say it's not going to go on longer.  And then my mom started saying shit like, I will send you to Canada.  I'm going to send you to Canada.  You and your brother are going to Canada.  You are not going to Vietnam. 
[01:34:30]  That Canada thing sounded like a good idea, but where the fuck do you go?  Who's going to fucking take care of you?  Exactly.  Can you stop this song?  Cause I want to play this whole fucking song.  And I'm like, mom, fuck that.  I'm going to the Nam.  I'm going to the fucking Nam.  And what'd she say?  She knew I wasn't going to the Nam.  I'd start crying.  She laughed at you?  That's it.  Barnes would be in my face fucking calling me pissy eyes.  You want to see old pissy eyes?  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  It would just be the pain of like, I fucking hurt my finger at the base camp. 
[01:35:00]  The only Vietnam memory I have, Sam Roberts, is my uncle coming home.  Oh.  And he, you know.  Thousand Yard Stare?  No.  Oh.  No, I don't think he.  What, do you run the motor pool in Saigon?  I think so.  I don't think he's.  Something.  I would have to ask my aunt, because unfortunately, he's no longer with us.  But great guy, too.  He was my, I shouldn't say my favorite uncle.  I got a few more out there.  Oh, boy.  He was right up there.  He was, yeah, he was great. 
[01:35:30]  Anyway, he showed up with his uniform.  Oh.  And I always thought, wow, man.  I guess after you're in the Army, you just got to walk around with the uniform on.  You walk around with the uniform.  Because he drove from way out east on Long Island.  Could have changed.  He could have had his regular clothes on, but I think he was kind of like a little proud,  which is kind of cool.  Yeah.  And then I think he knew that his very, very young at the time nephews would get a kick  out of seeing him in a fucking uniform.  Probably.  But I remember him showing up in his Army uniform there. 
[01:36:00]  There were a few of the people I remember coming back in their uniform, whether they  were coming back for good or leave or something like that.  There was a guy who lived next door from us in Central Islip.  I lived in one of the other apartments, and I remember before he even went, and he was  a very nice, fun guy and everything like that.  Oh, boy.  He came back on leave.  And the parents were very excited.  They put up bunting on the little apartment patio that they had.  Sure.  And they were, like, right next door to us. 
[01:36:30]  And they put up this bunting, and everyone in the complex knew that this guy was coming  home for a while, and we all went to, like, say hi and everything.  He fucking walked up with a look.  And even at that age, I remember looking at him and just saying, something's not the same  as when he fucking left.  Thousand-yard stare.  Wow.  Just not.  It was expressionless.  It was like his mouth went completely straight like a line across his face.  There wasn't a smile.  There wasn't a frown. 
[01:37:00]  It was just nothingness in his face anymore.  Gone.  Yeah.  And his mother's like, you know, oh, man.  Gives him a big hug, and he's just kind of going through the motions.  It was so fucked up.  Holy shit.  I wonder what that guy saw a mere, I don't know, 48 hours before.  He's got the, you know.  Pile of fucking.  The big six-foot.  Inoculated baby arms.  Something.  Yeah.  And now he's in front of an eight-foot hero.  Yeah.  With his family members around.  Yeah.  A couple balloons and streamers. 
[01:37:30]  But you wonder what he saw a mere few days earlier before they threw him on that plane  out of there.  Yeah.  I should have fucking grabbed a balloon and popped it behind his head.  Oh, God.  Fucking turns around and just chokes me.  Whatever happens to that guy.  Snaps my neck.  I have no idea.  Like, all those guys, you know, I remember a few of the NOM guys.  I know my gym teacher wound up getting splattered, you know.  Right.  That one.  I talk about that sometimes.  He came back for a visit to the school in the cafeteria, and he waved, and everybody's  applauding him. 
[01:38:00]  And then a few months later, we had the announcement.  Oh, we just want to announce.  And why would they do this as kids?  Was he lost over the Sea of Japan?  Yeah.  His plane spun in.  There were no survivors.  No survivors.  Yeah.  Why would they do it?  Like, now you would never tell the kids that.  Wouldn't you just say he moved to California?  Right.  Why wouldn't they do that?  Why wouldn't they do that?  They would tell the kids, but in a certain way, and there'd be grief counselors.  It was put over the PA like morning announcements.  Wow.  By the way, Mr. whatever the fuck his name was, has been killed in Vietnam. 
[01:38:30]  We're very proud of his service.  And as a kid, you're just there going, oh.  Oh, that's like the worst thing you could hear as a kid.  Oh, he's the dead guy.  Oh, God.  That's crazy.  Oh.  Yeah, that was weird.  I was affected by the nom.  Yeah.  Affected by the nom.  They could have.  As a child of the 80s.  Yes.  They could have said he moved to, where were you on, Long Island?  Ah, sure, yeah.  So you go all the way to the West Coast.  You move to fucking, make it a weird, like, kind of like, move to, I don't know, Sacramento. 
[01:39:00]  He's living in a commune.  And then every once in a while, just have a fake letter from the guy.  Yeah.  You check it in, and he says this and this, and he misses here, and he's going to try  to come back and visit soon, but he sends his love.  Whole nother fucking thought process back then.  Why would they fucking tell you?  Because it was supposed to be a good thing.  Like, you were supposed to be told this, and that he died for his country, and it was  a, you know, very noble thing, kind of a, eh, you know.  And it is noble, but.  It's a different time.  It was the 80s.  All right, now we could, now we could play that song here, uh, into break. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, man.  It just, it just sounded way too good to fucking talk over today.  This song is just fucking.  I love this song.  It conjures up the images of Huey's dusting off.  Right.  Yes.  Even I like this song.  Wow.  Really?  And I always complain about this.  Child of the 80s.  CCR, man.  Did John Fogarty get sued by CCR for writing this song?  Or CCR?  I don't know.  Was this the one?  I don't know.  Or was it run, run through the jungle?  So confusing.  He got sued by himself or something? 
[01:40:00]  One of the greatest.  He had to sue his own corporation or something.  I don't know.  In order to get the money that was due him.  I would have loved to have been in court for that case.  Oh, man.  Right.  He was suing himself, I think.  Sue yourself!  Because it was the only way out of something.  I want to sue myself for damages I've given me.  No, I think the rest of the band might have sued him.  Yeah.  But he was CCR.  I couldn't even name another guy from CCR.  Sorry.  Sorry to those guys.  Yeah.  What were the two songs that were similar? 
[01:40:30]  Run Through the Jungle was one of them, I think.  Born on the Bayou?  Born on the Bayou.  There's a bathroom on the right?  There might be a bathroom on the right.  There's a bathroom on the right.  I used to think that's what they said.  Give us some details on the John Fogerty lawsuit.  Please.  Sam Roberts.  Um, I'm just reading through this.  There's a long article about it.  It's way too wordy than it needs to be.  Really?  Find a different one. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Just find the quick paragraph one.  I like paragraphs.  Quickies.  A good paragraph.  Find a good paragraph.  That's all you need.  All right.  Here you go.  That looks a lot shorter.  Okay.  Yeah.  The old man down the road was simply run through the jungle with different words.  In other words, John Fogerty had plagiarized a John Fogerty song because he didn't own  the copyright.  That's great.  So he wrote a song.  He didn't have the copyright on it, so he copied himself, and then he got sued. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  But he was probably being an asshole.  He realized that he didn't own his CCR songs anymore, so he goes, well, as John Fogerty,  watch what I do.  Watch me now.  I'm just going to fucking rework the words.  And they were like, you can't copy your songs.  Right.  What songs were they?  I'm sorry.  Run Through the Jungle and Old Man Down the Road.  Yeah.  Can we hear some of that?  It is absolutely the same song.  Is it?  Can we hear the E-Rock?  Have you been paying attention?  Comment, E-Rock?  Can you play the two songs at the same time?  Wow.  He's snacking a little bit.  Are you snacking? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Was he snacking?  He was.  He was snacking.  He couldn't hear it because he was chewing.  E-Rock, do you know what we're talking about?  Be honest.  Yes.  Okay.  John Fogerty and CCR.  What songs?  Old Man Down the Road and...  Uh, Bayou Rising?  No.  Oh, no.  He wasn't paying attention.  He wasn't.  E-Rock?  You don't even know the songs then.  How are you supposed to play them if you didn't even know what we were...  Oh, E-Rock, comment.  Why?  What was he looking for? 
[01:42:30]  His whole job is to just pay attention for that one time we have to call on him.  God.  That's all you have to do, really.  Oh.  No, it's more than the water.  Let his guard down.  Run through the jungle and fucking Old Man Down the Road.  Play a little Run Through the Jungle.  Yeah.  Give us a little, like, 30 seconds of that first.  And then the Old Man Down the Road.  Right.  E-Rock, comment.  He wasn't paying attention.  E-Rock.  Here we go.  Okay.  Now, this is Run Through the Jungle? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, it is.  Fuck, I think I really like CCR.  I haven't thought about him in a while.  For being sort of a pseudo-bluesy-ish band, I do like them.  Oh, come on, man.  Even this type of blues you don't like?  No, I like them a lot.  All right.  Yeah, that's, like, the only kind of...  Run on the bar, you're...  Wait a minute.  Oh, I thought it was a nightmare.  You know, it's all so true. 
[01:43:30]  They told me don't go walking slow.  The devil's on the loop.  Better run through the jungle.  Better run through the jungle.  Better run through the jungle.  Hold on.  Oh, I thought it was a bad thing.  All right, that's Run Through the Jungle.  Now give us a little fucking old man down the road.  Old man down the road.  All right.  We'll see ya. 
[01:44:00]  Not as gritty, obviously.  No.  A little more polished.  I like a little dirt with my music.  Yeah.  A little bit.  You take a thunder from the mountain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You take a lightning from the sky.  Sky!  You bring a strong man to his begging knee.  You make the youngest mama cry. 
[01:44:30]  You got to hide it, hide it, hide it.  You got to jump and run.  You got to hide it, hide it, hide it.  The old man is down the road.  I do like a CCR.  Oh, my God, yeah.  I do kind of like the old CCR.  We're going to play the other one in its entirety into break.  But what happened with the lawsuit?  I forgot.  It's been many years.  Did he win?  Which John Fogerty lost?  The case ended up before a jury in 1988. 
[01:45:00]  Find me a jury.  Find me a jury.  Two-week trial.  Yeah.  Featured Fogerty taking the witness stand with guitar in hand to explain that.  Yes, the two songs may have sounded somewhat similar, but they were both variations on his  signature swamp rock style.  Oh!  Simply put. 
[01:45:30]  Simply put.  Yeah, his, he was.  Of course, two, John.  Yo.  He was saying that his song went, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din,  din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din,  Yes, now I get it.  He's a little thing.  It makes a difference.  Yes.  Fucking Vanilla Ice, it has to be said, he's a gangster.  He ends up fucking buying.  Gangster.  What did he end up buying?  Some people are refuting that.  He bought under pressure.  Yeah, he just finally said, fuck it, I'll just buy the song.  Some people are saying that he was fibbing and saying that was not true. 
[01:46:00]  But I was going to look into it, but then I lost interest.  Yeah, I was thinking about that.  Yeah.  Like just recently, at first, I was like, yeah, he's the fucking man, he's got all his cash  now, blah, blah, blah.  But then I was like, if he owned both those songs, would he have done Surreal Life?  Oh.  Exactly.  Awkward.  Right?  Would he have a show where he fixes houses on a network?  Are people dying from that show, too?  Not as many as Celebrity Rehab.  Oh.  What happened?  So, with the trial. 
[01:46:30]  Someone actually called Dr. Drew a serial killer.  I love it.  He's a serial killer.  We've been on to him forever.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  The two songs didn't meet legal standards of being substantially similar, which meant  John Fogerty won, won.  Against John Fogerty.  So, he won.  Right.  So, first John Fogerty won.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  The young?  No.  The second John Fogerty won, because the second John Fogerty is the one that wrote the second  song.  So, the old Fogerty beat the young Fogerty? 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  Nice.  So, what did the old Fogerty do to the young Fogerty, because he won?  Kicked him in the mouth.  Kicked him in the mouth.  You can't sue yourself.  Make a paradox.  All right.  You remember what CCR song we're playing at the break?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  All right.  When we get back, we got My Strange Addiction.  Oh, yeah.  Addicted to bee stings.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  She gets bees to sting.  All right.  That's really fucking weird.  I haven't watched Strange Addiction in a while.  Yeah.  It looks like I've got to start watching that show again. 
[01:47:30]  And this lady, just a little tease.  Margaret.  She looks like the woman from the...  Remember that news clip that went viral a couple weeks ago, where the lady was like,  yeah, I showed her my tits?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what this lady looks like.  That figures.  Okay.  All right, good.  And then we got some lady doing an orgasm in front of Joy Behar.  Just a real quick one.  Boy.  Ugh.  Joy Behar being a shock jock or something?  On current TV.  On current TV. 
[01:48:00]  Oh.  You mean Al Jazeera?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Al Jazeera TV.  Al Gore.  Soled his soul.  Al Gore was here yesterday.  Did you see Al Gore yesterday?  I did not.  I left as everybody was kind of scurrying about, making sure things were ready for him.  Did anyone that is with this show see Al Gore?  Iraq coming?  No?  No.  I don't think so.  Did Troy Kwan get Al Gore some bitches?  Were people allowed to walk the hallways, or is he one of those guests where they shut down  this fucking joint?  It was fairly well shut down.  Really?  Does he still have Secret Service protection?  Does the Vice President get that for life? 
[01:48:30]  I think he has detail, yeah.  Does he?  Yeah.  If we got club soda, Kenny, I think Al Gore's got somebody.  I always wait.  You know, why does Kenny, and Chris also, who takes over for Kenny when he's gone, why do  they go to the end of the hall when we take a piss?  I don't know.  Why do they watch us down the hall like anything's going to happen to us here in the building?  I don't know.  It's awkward.  I have no idea.  I have nothing to do with that. 
[01:49:00]  If they're not watching you at all times...  Then their job is meaningless.  Why are they here?  But do you understand how silly that makes us look to everyone else in this building?  We look like assholes.  We look like fucking idiots.  They talk about it, you know, too.  Yes, like, oh, they need a security guy to watch him go to the bathroom?  They actually talk about it.  What's that?  Yeah, get on mic, Roland.  Yeah, they do talk about it.  I don't fucking want that.  Believe me, I can protect myself.  And they ask you if you have wipers, too.  They ask you if you have wipers. 
[01:49:30]  Now, that would be fun if Kenny had to wipe our asses.  I don't know.  Dude, it's embarrassing.  It's very embarrassing.  But then the alternative is, okay, so you don't need somebody here.  Yeah.  Yeah, so...  No, we need someone here to, like...  We don't.  Yeah, you're right.  We don't.  Let's just try to take care of some people.  No, I'm kidding.  Of course.  It's our posse.  You bring some people up with you.  What?  I grew up with him that bad yesterday.  It was like normal security for him.  He didn't have the guys with the earpieces?  On a scale of one to ten, how mad are you about the GL? 
[01:50:00]  Zero.  Really?  Yeah.  So it goes up.  In the end, you're not mad.  That's very mad.  We were scared to see you today.  Because it's one to ten, and then it goes, like, back to zero.  Yeah.  So mad.  Are you not mad because Sam's talking to GL?  No, I'm not mad at all.  Really?  No.  Why did I misread this one?  I was scared to see you.  Saw Suits last night.  I was happy.  When are we getting some more of that gravy shit? 
[01:50:30]  Probably March is Meatball Month.  Weren't they voted, like, best sauce in New York or something?  Yeah, and then that meatball place was voted, like, one of the top meatballs.  Are you going to put together a Meatball History Month thing, Sam, for us?  Yeah.  Black man invented all the meatball.  Wait, we're not kidding.  I invented the meatball.  That's my meatball, nigga.  Wait.  Sunday gravy?  Yeah.  When do we get our fucking free Sunday gravy?  They're done with us already?  No, no.  Well, tell them to bring some in.  Damn. 
[01:51:00]  And it was voted, like, best sauce in New York.  This shit is amazing.  It's so good.  I don't need to fucking do a commercial for them.  I'm just talking.  Dude, who makes fun of us?  Everyone, dude.  And I just hear people, they go, oh.  Mars, say, Mars just gave it that.  Mars, get in here.  Mars, get in here.  This is fucking, this is something that has to.  This is something that has to be brought up.  Mars, what's up?  Dude, you both of you talked about so big time, man.  Everyone.  Like, what the hell do they need that for?  Who's going to hurt them?  I know.  It's in the building, for the love of God. 
[01:51:30]  You know the mashup laughs at you, right?  Yeah.  Well, we laugh at them.  Sorry to bring up some names, but you know the mashup laughs at you.  Yeah, well, we laugh at them.  I don't need the mashup.  They got the corner studio.  Exactly.  They're watching Kenny standing there looking at you as you walk to the bathroom.  But we have nothing to do with that.  Do people understand that?  But we have something to do with the fact that we should tell them we don't want them  fucking following us halfway down the hall so they have a fucking interlocking fields  of fire view down both hallways for us going to the bathroom. 
[01:52:00]  I don't want it anymore.  I'm saying it right now.  Stop with watching me fucking walk to the bathroom.  It's the dumbest thing.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  They all talk, huh?  Yes.  Oh, great.  Now there's no way.  Wait, they're not over it yet?  The stigma's going to be there forever?  They still talk about it?  Yes.  Dude.  Every time it's done.  Put it this way.  We would still talk about it if it was someone else.  We look like assholes.  Man, we look like assholes, man.  After the break, we're going to make fun of Opie and Anthony.  They're fucking idiots.  They're fucking assholes.  Do you know they actually have a security guy that walks halfway down in the hallway 
[01:52:30]  and watches them just in case something happens?  What's going to happen?  Who's going to come out?  That's exactly what they say.  We have nothing to do.  Could you pass it around?  We have nothing to do with that.  Taylor on Cosmo Radio still laughs at you guys?  Who?  Remember Taylor from Cosmo Radio?  I absolutely do not.  They know who you are because you make such a presence every time you go to the bathroom.  With the fucking security detail.  Oh, my God. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, God.  Security watches the hallway.  For who?  For what?  Why is he standing there?  I don't know.  Can he set that in motion?  What's his...  What's...  Oh, wait, wait.  I just got a text.  From who?  From Traquan.  Traquan.  He's reminding me exactly why that is a practice.  All right, good.  Tell me.  This goes back to the Opie-Arty argument.  Got a little ugly. 
[01:53:30]  Remember years ago when Opie and Artie got into that argument?  Is that what this is all about?  Me and Artie almost went at it because he was trying to be nice and say hi to me.  That's a bad way of phrasing it.  Me and Artie almost got into a fight because he was nice and said hello.  Well, come on now.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because now, you know, I have to explain.  Yes.  Because there's assholes out there.  I'm totally cool with Artie.  I just saw him over the weekend with Jim Norton at the anti-social show.  I hate the phoniness because those guys, you know, they're on Howard's show at the time 
[01:54:00]  trashing us, this and that, and then they see us in the hall and they're buddy-buddies  with us saying hi.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  That's phony bullshit.  And that's what I called them out on.  Right.  But then we talked it out like a couple days later and there were hugs and all sorts of shit.  I said, all right, at least, you know, you understand where I was coming from.  Because you know what?  I see, I haven't in a while, but I see Robin Quivers.  She can't be nicer to me.  And then she's on that fucking show making believe we're pieces of shit and we're low 
[01:54:30]  lives and we're fucking ripping off Howard and all that crap.  I'm like, I don't deal with that phoniness.  Who's the real Robin?  The one I see in the street who couldn't be nicer, who I've walked with a few times,  you know, a few blocks or the one that she has to play, you know, Howard's little fucking  bitch when Howard starts in with that shit.  Like that's, that's what this is about.  Wow.  It just got real.  Well, sorry.  But no, the thing is, and actually in the end, I think Robin is a really nice person.  I really do.  I think she just gets caught up in the nonsense.  But can we tell Kenny that there's no longer fucking, you know, we could stand down from 
[01:55:00]  DEFCON fucking, what, what, what, why is he still walking to the end of the hall and  looking down the hallway?  It's in your drones.  Yeah.  Isn't there drones now?  A Kenny drone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't even think he's real anymore.  And then why the fuck does he do it when I go?  It's, well, because he's not going to just do it for opiate, not for you.  You guys are both celebrities, two names on the wall.  Then he's playing favorites and that's a whole thing.  What's happening?  I never wanted to be watched walk into the bathroom. 
[01:55:30]  You look like pre-Madonna's when it happens.  No shit!  Oh.  Even the receptionist goes, oh, your bosses can't go to the bathroom by themselves.  The receptionist!  Oh my god.  She goes, do they know where the bathroom is, Ma?  And they're like, yeah.  I don't know.  Ouch.  Holy fuck.  That's great.  We are fucking assholes in this place.  We look like idiots.  Sway.  Oh, no.  Interviewed Obama.  Right?  Interviewed Justin Bieber. 
[01:56:00]  Works for MTV.  Television celebrity.  Uh-huh.  He's taking shots at us?  No, but he makes his way to the bathroom on his own.  All right.  Fair enough.  Everyone does!  There's not one person that has an armed guard that takes him to the shitter!  Allegedly.  Whatever.  His hands are weapons.  That's right.  All right.  This practice ends today.  Today.  Today.  Today.  Can Chris?  Today.  Chris is here instead of Kenny.  Is he comfortable to make that move?  Kenny has given him specific instructions. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  Is Chris comfortable to make that move?  Is Chris right out there?  Yeah.  Open the door and tell him.  Open the door.  Chris, how are you doing, man?  You're going to put him in a tough spot.  This is bad.  It's fine.  Chris, let me explain something.  Me and Opie are what's called the laughingstock of Sirius XM Satellite Radio because Kenny has  started this practice of escorting us to the corner and then looking down the hallway  just in case the boogeyman comes out while we're trying to fucking piss. 
[01:57:00]  And I know that you are only doing what Kenny has ordered you to do.  That's correct.  And the out-cue guys also, they said it was a little gay.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The out-cue guys have called us gay for that.  So I am making an executive decision here.  Executive order is being put in place.  You are relieved of any responsibility of walking us to the toity.  Understood, sir.  No longer will you have to, as we leave, walk to the end of the hall, look down there 
[01:57:30]  to make sure we can pee by ourselves and then walk us back.  Okay, understood.  All right?  Understood.  And if Kenny has any fucking problem with the fact that I have now initiated new policy,  he can go fuck himself.  Whoa.  Wow.  Because he has made us look stupid for years.  Years.  I mean, it's going to take a long time for people to get over this one.  I want to now let it be known to all the people at Sirius XM Satellite Radio that I don't 
[01:58:00]  need my fucking dick held on my way to the bathroom.  You know what?  I think E-Rock needs to make the announcement.  We have a bullhorn.  E-Rock, be the town crier.  E-Rock, you got a bullhorn?  Walk around.  No, we never got another one.  Walk around the building.  Can you shout it?  And let people know that we are going to the bathroom.  I'll do it as you're going to the bathroom.  No, you need to see how many shows you can get on the air today to make that announcement  on their shows.  Yes.  Really?  Could you?  Start with the mashup.  Okay.  Do we have a tape recorder or something?  Tape recorder.  How old am I?  Could you fucking record it? 
[01:58:30]  I think I can run around with an 8-track.  I want, starting right now, I want to get the message out to as many shows as possible.  Yes.  Yes.  Who will do it?  E-Rock and Roland?  I'm embarrassed.  Roland, you want in on this?  Oh, Travis is coming in now.  Travis.  Who else called us faggots?  I was just going to say the Al Q guys are walking down the hall right now if you want to tell  them first.  Oh, here they are.  Yeah.  Well, they're coming.  Are they coming this way?  Yeah.  All right.  They got real pissed our first day here when I asked if they would go on the air.  Yeah.  They don't like it. 
[01:59:00]  That was three years ago, though.  They don't like it.  I don't care if they're part of our shenanigans.  They're not going to come in.  I'm just going to scream, leave the door open.  As they walk by, I'm just going to yell it to them.  Okay.  I'm going to yell it to them.  This will be one showdown.  One show will be taken care of.  Because they're nice guys.  Once this is done.  There is cool guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I like those guys.  Definitely.  Like?  Walking up the hall.  Yeah, you know what I mean.  Like, like?  Like, like, or just like?  Yeah.  I just want to let everybody know.  Hold on, hold on.  Two seconds.  I just want to let you guys know.  We will no longer have a fucking escort to the bathroom. 
[01:59:30]  I don't know what that was all about.  I never meant to have that.  They said they're happy for you.  Did they say that?  Thank God.  All right, good.  All right, that's one done.  One show down.  Nice.  One done.  You know what the real shame is?  What?  The Martha people have left the company thinking you two are a couple of prisses.  Fucking prima donna bathroom divas.  They were just walking into their-  Toilet diva.  They were just walking into the studio.  I opened up here to see if they were all right. 
[02:00:00]  And one of them just laughed and goes, I guess they heard us talking.  Oh!  No!  You've been the subject of conversation on the OutCube channel.  This is-  It's so embarrassing.  You know what?  I've always thought it was stupid and useless and stuff, but I never really went as deep into  looking at how stupid we looked.  I didn't even think twice about it.  I just thought it was a dumb thing that no one was picking up on.  They're production guys. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Literally, not only do they not go on the air, they don't talk to people.  around here that talk about you guys.  Fuck.  Dude, do you know how stupid we've looked for years?  Yeah, I do.  All right.  Who's going to let the morning mashup know?  Sugar Tom right now?  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Those mashup fucks are probably always yapping about us.  We can wait until they walk by the studio.  And yell at them?  Yeah, they walk by our studio, what, six times an hour because they have nothing to do?  I'm fighting back. 
[02:01:00]  Fuck this shit.  At least they can do it by themselves, Opie.  They're making fun of us, but they walk by and have coffee breaks six times an hour  because the music is doing the talking, as some radio stations would like to say.  Oh, my God.  We let the music do the talking.  Well, there's also the Cosmo morning show.  Yeah, but who listens to them?  We need them.  Who listens to any morning show except this one?  How funny would it be if we went to the bathroom and got the shit beat out of us down the hallway?  If all the other morning shows are waiting for you? 
[02:01:30]  Just start beating the living piss out of us.  Yeah, man, we're playing our cards now.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, man.  Finally, we've been waiting for this opportunity.  They've let their guard down.  Finally, we've been waiting.  We've been waiting for this moment.  Just got me.  Kramer Dean Karate.  What?  Kramer?  Yeah, I heard it.  Yeah.  It's Karate.  Karate.  Can we take a break with our CCR song?  Can we?  I don't know.  Maybe we should check with someone.  B-Stings next and some woman having a mini-orgasm in front of Joy Behar. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  But first this in its entirety.  Turn it up.  Some folks are born made to wave the flag.  Ooh, they're red, white, and blue. 
[02:02:30]  And when the band plays pale to the chief.  Ooh, they point the cannon at you.  Oh, no.  It ain't me.  It ain't me.  I ain't no senator's song.  Oh, it ain't me.  It ain't me.  I ain't no fortune and wrong.  Oh, some folks are born silver spoon in hand.  Lord, don't they help themselves, yeah?  Oh, when the tax man comes to the door. 
[02:03:00]  Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah?  It ain't me.  It ain't me.  I ain't no millionaire's song, no, no.  It ain't me.  Yeah, me.  I ain't no fortune and wrong, no.  Yeah, the folks in Harry, the star-spangled eyes 
[02:03:30]  Ooh, they'll send you down to war  And when you ask them how much should we give  Ooh, they'll only answer more, more, more  It ain't me, it ain't me  I ain't no military or something  It ain't me, it ain't me 
[02:04:00]  I ain't no fortunate want  It ain't me, it ain't me  I ain't no fortunate want  Yeah, the people, they'll solo  Life in corporate America can be a grind  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.

Presenting Unmatchables, where two completely incompatible people are locked in a room and forced to make awkward conversations.  How old are you?  Did you say this? 
[02:06:00]  I'm almost 30.  You're almost 30.  Well, you look very good.  You look very pretty.  Watch the season premiere as Australian comedian and drunkard Jim Jeffries attempts to seduce American adult starlet Justine Jolie.  Hey, you'll learn to love me.  Over time, you will love me.  Will Justine be impressed by Jim's plush living arrangements?  I have a studio flat in L.A. which has a pungent smell that I can't find.  But I'm going to endeavor to find that.  And then you'll get quite the raping.  Wow.  That was a joke.  Come on.  That was funny.  Look, I've got a little accent. 
[02:06:30]  Will Jim be able to woo Justine with his thoughts of romance?  I don't like kissing girls, right?  I used to like kissing girls when I was like 14 or 15.  But then after I got my dick sucked, I was over kissing.  Kissing is now a dead zone for me.  That's really unfortunate because that's one of the main things that I really enjoy about a man.  Or his thoughts on making love.  I'd rather have a threesome that involves a guy and a girl because I like seeing the cock going into her mouth as I'm fucking her.  I just like seeing a girl being degraded.  Oh, degraded.  Oh, oh, he stopped himself before he said it. 
[02:07:00]  I said degraded, you slut.  Can Jim Jeffries turn it all around?  I love you.  And I mean that.  I love you.  I've never been in love before.  Probably not.  I would eat your poo.  That's a good thing, Jim.  It's not a good thing for you.  No, but it would be hilarious to fucking watch.  I'm going to dig it out with a knife.  Find out just how incompatible these two are.  Why does he hate me so much?  I don't hate you.  I'm just having fun.  On the latest, greatest late-night dating game show only on the Opie and Anthony Network, Unmatchables.  Yeah, always sexual tension with me and the guests, man. 
[02:07:30]  New from Grody Publishing comes the audiobook, So Erotic, it will make you question everything.  Damn, that's a good book on tape.  The best-selling cultural phenomenon evolves just for men.  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.  The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.  Club Soda Kenny takes you on a journey you've only been to in your deepest fantasies. 
[02:08:00]  Suck me, baby.  Millions of red-blooded men have gotten rigid over the excitement of Fifty Shades of Gay.  Bro, I've tasted my cum?  After hearing Fifty Shades of Gay, I would totally be down for tasting someone else's.  Or whatever.  I'm a quivering, moist mess, and he hasn't even touched me.  I've always been a guy that's, like, totally into chicks with tits and stuff like that. 
[02:08:30]  But you know what?  This book is freaking hot as shit.  Holy fuck.  This is wrong.  But holy hell, is it erotic.  For the first time, I'm sexually attracted to something that isn't available at the deli counter.  My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid desire.  Ooh, I don't fuck guys, man.  But I'll jack off to this, man.  Damn!  The experts agree Fifty Shades of Gay is a must-listen.  Hello, I'm Dr. Gay. 
[02:09:00]  This audiobook is a must-listen for any man looking to further a healthy sex life.  I'm erect.  Fifty Shades of Gay.  If you're not turned on now, you will be.  Yum.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  I see the bad moon rising.  I see trouble on the way. 
[02:09:30]  I guess E-Rock has decided it's CCR day.  I don't know if we made it official, E-Rock.  I don't think we made it official.  We were debating if we were going to do Radiohead Day.  So, hey, what's going on, buddy?  You went to the bathroom by yourself.  How was that?  It was pretty cool.  A little strange, right?  I made a friend on the way back.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Some guy walking out and talking about, like, guns.  Really?  Yeah.  So you had a normal conversation because there was no intimidation factor. 
[02:10:00]  No intimidation of a fucking guard.  But walking to the bathroom?  Right.  It's a long walk.  People should know that.  You have to go down this long hallway and then down a longer hallway.  You're passing a lot of studios.  A lot of shows.  All the studios have glass walls so people will see you.  And what they have seen is Kenny escorting us.  Well, this time, of course, Chris is here, but I've told him and nobody was escorting me.  But now as I'm walking to the bathroom, I'm looking in every studio and looking at all the people that have thought we were complete assholes for having a guard walk us to the bathroom. 
[02:10:30]  I saw the black chick in the fucking one studio there.  Of course, the morning mashup.  Yep.  Our own.  Sway.  Our own pal.  Yeah.  Studio.  Our own pal, Stinky, I saw.  And I'm like, Stinky thinks we're fucking assholes.  The staff, the receptionist, the fucking, the guys that work on the air conditioning units 24-7.  The other guards. 
[02:11:00]  The other guards.  Because they look at it a whole different way.  Like, oh, really?  You know, we're supposed to be guarding this floor and we're not good enough for those guys?  It opened my eyes to how dumb we look.  I confirmed.  I went into the mashup during the break and said, were you guys among the people that made fun of Opie and Anthony for having an escort to the bathroom?  Uh-huh.  They were like, absolutely, yes.  All the time.  You know what?  Fuck those people.  And Nicole said that she would frequently ask Kenny, why are you doing this? 
[02:11:30]  Do you hold it for them, too?  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  It's getting edgy.  I fucking hate that this became something.  Oh, yeah.  And now it will never go away.  Because when you go by yourself, people, oh, baby boy learned how to use the toilet?  It's just like, oh, I don't know.  Yeah, we're going to have to deal with that for a little while.  That's okay.  No, this is a forever thing.  This is like a kid that pissed himself in fucking second grade.  In high school, they're still calling him pissy pants.  You mean Jimmy Peepy pants?  Jimmy Peepy pants.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, what's our nicknames, then? 
[02:12:00]  We're fucking faggots.  No.  Can't go to the bathroom.  No.  By ourselves.  Shock, shock, baby boys.  Shock, shock, baby boys.  That's what they've been calling you.  Shit.  I don't know where they got that name from.  We're never going to shake this.  No.  And of course, Sam has something to do with this.  Yeah, well, somebody tweeted the fact that Sam is to blame for this because he's been sitting on this info that we've been being laughed at for a long time, and you could have said something.  First of all, everybody has known this.  It's a thing.  And second of all...  Yeah, but you didn't bring it to our attention until today. 
[02:12:30]  You knew it before because two and a half years ago, when you were in your war with Cosmo Radio and me and Kenny had to go into their studio, the war was because they were going on the air and making fun of you guys for walking around these halls with a bodyguard.  And that was two and a half years ago, and you didn't stop.  Well, I don't even remember talking to you.  I don't like the idea that...  Sam, I got great news.  Look, CD.  Oh.  Sudoku is done for today.  Damn. 
[02:13:00]  There you go, Sam Roberts.  All right.  Sam gets all the...  Signed, sealed, and now...  Is it signed?  Yep.  Delivered.  Sam gets all the completed ones.  That'll be a prize for the after show because GL won't be on it.  Check my work.  I didn't get to check my work on that one.  Check your work.  I hated show your work.  Yeah.  Oh, show your work sucked.  I wasn't a show your work.  It's like, I can fucking get the answer.  That's all I need.  Did you just scribble some shit and hope they didn't really look at your show your work?  Yeah.  I would hope they would never look, but they would always ask you to show your fucking work. 
[02:13:30]  Well, we got...  So the bathroom thing is out of the way.  That's good.  Well, no, it's not.  But Chris had...  This is part one.  Chris had to go, don't worry, I'm going to stay here.  But you know he's freaking out because if he doesn't do what Kenny tells him to do, then  that's another problem.  Well, that's going to be part two of this is making Kenny not fucking follow.  But Chris is probably in trouble now because he is...  Not doing what Kenny told him to do.  I will vouch for him.  And Kenny is going to think that Chris did something wrong because this change happened 
[02:14:00]  under Chris's watch.  Oh, boy.  Kenny doesn't like change.  No.  We all have learned that over the years.  No, he doesn't.  He does not like the change thing.  Well, fuck that because that's now done.  Mark this day in history as the last fucking day that security escorted us down to the  bathroom.  Did we just go gay?  Not so.  We're a week out of the gay zone.  People are fucking calling us out on the whole Fifty Shades of Gay promo. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  Did we play Fifty Shades of what?  E-Rock.  But does that break the rule?  Yes.  It says gay in the title.  That means we've got to start over?  We have to start over.  It says gay in the title.  AJ Poopy Shits is on that bit.  Yeah.  Although he's not.  So a week of not being gay, we have to start over again?  Yeah.  We made it one week.  Yeah.  I guess technically.  Well, you started over after Wednesday because you played the gay bit for Bob Kelly. 
[02:15:00]  Thanks, E-Rock.  But you were the one that ruined it.  Oh, you blew it.  We were eight days in.  Nine days in.  A little over a week in.  Oh, my God.  The racist wrestlers made Fox News.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Real America.  I told you this is a big story.  It's not a stupid wrestling thing.  It's stupid, but.  So we have to.  The gay countdown clock has to go back to zero.  This is worse than the wrestler death clock.  So can we look at micro penises then if we blew the gay? 
[02:15:30]  No.  Come on, dude.  No.  Let's just stay.  If we blew the gay.  Oh, she thinks we're assholes.  Of course she does.  Look at that.  I'm black ass.  I would put her at the top of the African-American girl list in this place.  Is that the chick who does the show from Renata?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're allowed to talk to her like this, but as soon as we get a little too many details involved,  then we have to get in trouble and stuff.  Yeah, I'm just saying as far as, you know, system.  We blew the gay, so can we go micro penises if we're going to start over anyway? 
[02:16:00]  No.  Why not start over now instead of starting over later?  There's no reason to delve into micro penis.  I don't want to do anything else with penises for a long time.  I'm done with the penis.  Micro or other.  I'm still fucked up from last week.  Yeah, I'm still affected by that.  The only one that's not fucked up and he's mad that we're fucked up about it is Jim Norton.  Jim Norton is actually mad that we're fucked up about it.  He was all in.  He's mad that the videos aren't everywhere. 
[02:16:30]  I was affected by that.  It was.  It was terrible.  Everyone, even Troy Kwan, who we know is down for anything.  For whatever.  It's an A thing.  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  Anything, everything.  A lot of people are asking, why didn't Sam Roberts protect O&A?  with that gossip shit that was going on for years.  Because I gossip.  Who's this guy?  Is he laughing at us?  Oh, yeah.  They'll all laugh at you.  They'll all laugh at you.  He's wearing a yellow fleece pullover and he's laughing at you.  Everyone's laughing. 
[02:17:00]  All I'm thinking now is how fucking silly we looked for years.  All this time that you were laughing at you-know-who, Mr. Star Wars.  Oh, God.  He was sitting there going like, well, at least I don't have a fucking lunk following me to the bathroom every day.  You deal with Kenny, now that you called him a lunk, by the way.  All right, we got Joy Behar.  She does a show.  She's like a very funny comic, but then she has to do nonsense TV with Barbara Walters and the gang.  And then if that's not bad enough, she goes and does another nonsense show. 
[02:17:30]  Which nonsense show is this from?  Oh, the Al Jazeera?  She used to be on Headline News, I think, for CNN, and then they moved her over to Current TV.  And that Joy Behar you see on TV is very different than the one you see out and about every once in a while.  Indeed he do.  And she had a woman on there, and she thought herself to a mini-orgasm.  Right, so they're talking about, this woman is, she's talking about how great orgasms are.  And Joy Behar says, well, you know.  Back in the ground.  There was, yeah, really. 
[02:18:00]  There was this story about the woman who couldn't stop having orgasms, and this chick ended up killing herself.  Because she couldn't go to work.  There was just orgasms all the time.  Ah.  She was torture.  Is that a real story?  Yeah.  Why weren't we talking about that story?  I don't know, you weren't on a game that day, I guess.  What?  I said, maybe you had some better stuff to do that day.  Oh, my Sudoku got in the way?  Yeah.  Probably a complete Sudoku puzzle that day.  Jimmy wrote three books during this show.  Let me do a Sudoku puzzle.  It's a great defense. 
[02:18:30]  He actually wrote all his books during the show.  He wrote New York Times best-selling books during the show.  And you're going to beat me up for doing a Sudoku every once in a while?  It's quite a talent.  Good for you.  Keeps me from interrupting and shit.  But no, but this woman...  And he does chess with friends, and we all have our things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the time, man, I don't know what the fuck he's doing over there.  I'm chit-chatting.  Looking at some titties.  I chit-chat with the people on Pell Talk.  So there was a chick that just had a lot of orgasms during the day? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, and she ended up killing herself.  Why?  That would be cool.  Because it was literally an orgasm every five seconds.  But then again, if that happened to a guy, you'd be very, very dehydrated.  Yeah, yeah.  If you were cumming all the time, you wouldn't be able to keep up with the fucking hydration.  What if you didn't cum like fluid, but you had the feeling of cumming all the time?  That would rule.  Like you just constantly, like...  That...  That...  Yes, you're twitching.  That would rule.  Would that rule? 
[02:19:30]  I don't know.  It'd be so hard to go to sleep.  That could be a little fucked up.  How many times a day would you have to deal with that feeling?  Let's break this down.  Wait, before it became annoying?  No, I'm just saying, how many?  Like every hour you'd have to deal with that throughout your whole day?  Way more than every hour.  You're talking about every 20 seconds.  Wow.  This girl.  Yeah.  She's lying.  She's dead.  She's lying down in a coffin.  She's a lying dead broad then. 
[02:20:00]  Then why'd she kill herself?  If you're having an orgasm every hour, you're not going to kill yourself like that.  Well, how about you don't wear such tight pants?  Is that what I'm like to test?  Lying dead girl.  Stop riding a bicycle everywhere?  Yeah.  Whatever the fuck she was doing.  So...  So this lady comes on, Joy Behar, and says, look how easy it is?  Yeah, this lady comes on and she's all about the orgasms.  And she says she can think her way to orgasms.  And she's sitting there with Joy Behar and fucking comes all over herself.  Holy shit. 
[02:20:30]  Do we have the video?  Yeah, but it doesn't...  Is she a squirter?  I will guarantee that she's a pig.  She's not in the traditional sense.  She's not a looker, right?  But she's not a...  What is she looking for?  I'll give her a five and a half.  Five and a half?  Let me see her picture.  I'll put the official number on her.  What was the name of the TV station?  Current, I think.  Just inching my balls. 
[02:21:00]  That's so stupid.  I like balls.  Joy.  Say anything is the name of her show.  She's not afraid to.  Really?  Then why isn't she saying it in front of Barbara Walters?  She sits there and fucking plays her little part.  I bet someone walks her to the...  Oh.  Maybe I should not make fun of that.  Oh, she's laughing at us.  Everyone.  She just fucking licks and laughs.  Right?  Yeah.  That's all I'm seeing now is everyone that probably has made fun of us. 
[02:21:30]  She looks like Beyonce.  Oh, that's Beyonce.  This ain't way too long.  It really is.  You know why?  Because they took all the videos off YouTube.  Why?  Because they wanted you to go to their current website.  Fuck them.  And the one that TMZ has has all their little TMZ font stuff.  That fucking Al-Qaeda page.  Should we play it from there now that we have it up or should we go with what you gave me?  Just go with the disc because I cut out all the bullshit.  All the bullshit.  I just want to see what she looks like.  Why is this taking so long?  That's true.  We need to see what she looks like. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  That's all.  What the hell is...  I don't even know what this commercial is for.  I think it's for Windows fucking 8 or some shit.  Windows 8?  I mean, I can't keep up with all this technology.  Something like that.  Bam, bam, bam.  Oh, my God.  Now Angry Birds?  Angry Birds.  And you can't click out of these commercials when they're on Current TV?  Not on Current.  Wow.  They use their own a little bit better.  Microsoft.  There you go.  Ripping off.  Current.  Current TV. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Where is this broad?  There she is.  Yeah, you.  Well, you know what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me take them.  She kind of looks like...  How's her box?  From the fucking...  Apparently drippy.  She's all right.  She's all right.  Yeah.  She's all right.  She's like...  I throw her a-banging.  Here's the audio.  Yeah, I mean, that would be a problem if you just start having orgasms all day long.  I have to just keep mine down because I can think myself there. 
[02:23:00]  No kidding.  Yeah.  How do you do that?  Well, it's using my tools, using my breath, using my inner vision,  meaning, like, I can think myself, think myself into the fantasy.  I could do it right now.  This is scary.  You could have an orgasm right now.  I'm using my pelvic floor muscles.  Right now, sitting in that chair, you could have an orgasm.  Nice sexy talk she has there.  Missed it.  A little, little mini one.  She did it.  That was it?  Was it good for you, doctor?  I loved it.  Ew.  That was it?  That's stupid.  She goes like this.  Jupe. 
[02:23:30]  Stop it.  That ain't no orgasm.  She makes a jupe sound when she has an orgasm.  They do a lot of yelling, fucking.  That was a complete waste of time.  Hollering.  I'm just mad now.  And this thing is all over the place.  Why is it all over the place?  Because she didn't even do anything.  She goes jupe.  That's terrible.  Aw, there's.  Even this frump laughs at us?  In turn from the fucking.  That frump laughs at us.  She laughs at us.  Yes, she does.  Who?  Well, you can't say who she is.  Pudgy ass.  You like that?  No, it's just like, that would be a fun fucking ass to see. 
[02:24:00]  Are you kidding me?  I would just like to look at it.  Right.  Smack it.  I want to smack her ass.  I want to pull her pants down and smack her ass.  Give her a little spanky.  Yeah, I want to spank her.  Her fucking chubby ass.  Oh, you tell me how naughty you've been.  Yeah, what are they saying over there at the mashup about us?  What are they saying?  Just smack her ass.  Well, that video is a waste of time and people should not be checking it out.  Did you just come?  I just came just a little. 
[02:24:30]  It's disgusting.  It really is disgusting.  I thought myself there.  Yeah?  Yep.  In the old days, like when you first start getting sexually active, you could think yourself  pretty close.  Oh, yeah.  To an orgasm.  You could think yourself into a raging hard-on, that's for sure.  You ever have an orgasm because you're just made out?  Never, no.  Yeah, I didn't either.  Is that true?  Did you?  No.  Were you dry humping? 
[02:25:00]  Nope.  Because I'd give you dry humping, but if you're just making out, you're Forrest Gump.  It was outside.  Oh!  It was outside the North Port movie theater.  The 99 cent theater?  Yeah, after a 99 cent movie.  Nice.  And then I think she was expected a little more.  Oh, no.  I was all gooey in my pants.  How long were you making out?  Would you just start making out?  It was just hot.  Oh, my God.  I was a youngster, though. 
[02:25:30]  That's funny.  Give me a little break.  Just dated a guy?  No, I wasn't even a youngster.  I'll be honest.  I was in college already.  Wow.  Whoa.  Yeah, I was home from college.  Yeah, I was probably 20, 21.  And you completely shot a load in your pants from making out.  Yep.  God.  Yep.  Being that excited has got to be great.  Yep.  Jess dated a guy in high school who was like that good-looking artsy guy.  Okay.  Like, he was like, hey, man.  And, you know, every girl loved him.  Of course.  But she said she didn't date him long because he used to come in his pants all the time. 
[02:26:00]  And it made me feel so good when she told me that.  All the time?  She said every time.  She said he never didn't.  She had to end it because they would make out and every time he would come in his pants.  Wow.  I can pretty much tell you I only spilled semen once.  Just the one time?  I believe so.  Maybe if I had to really think about it, maybe.  No, I can't even think of another incident.  It was just one of those things.  It was something.  That's hilarious. 
[02:26:30]  All the time?  He was the opposite of Sal.  He would just come in his pants way too quick every time.  That's hilarious.  There was a time I was at this cabin upstate New York with some chick.  And we were there for two nights.  The first night, she was the, you know, this whole, I don't know.  And I'm just fucking, you know.  Working it?  I'm working it like a motherfucker.  Trying to figure out the combination?  Trying to figure out the combination.  First night, we're in bed, naked, fooling around with each other. 
[02:27:00]  But, I don't know.  You know, let's just, okay, whatever, whatever, whatever.  Didn't do anything that whole night.  Like, blue balls, the whole thing.  Pain, the whole thing.  Next night, we're doing the same thing.  And she finally, you know, she's like, oh, okay.  I'm like, cool.  Fucking.  I fucking put it in.  And I'm like, holy shit.  I'm going to come. 
[02:27:30]  I can't move.  I couldn't move.  I'm like, freeze.  Freeze.  It's going to freeze.  I gave her the worst fucking ever.  Because I tried, like, I didn't want to.  You couldn't get a rhythm going.  I was so wound up from the night before.  The best is the dramatic.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  I thought I could put it in and pull back out. 
[02:28:00]  I thought I was good for a complete stroke.  But half a stroke, I'm ready to fucking.  Don't move.  So you got all worked up the night before and then didn't jerk off after that?  No.  That I should have done, young Sam.  Of course.  You're right.  But, yeah.  I wound up pulling out.  Yeah, coming all over.  Yeah, that'll happen.  But then I think I was able to get back, you know, in the serviceable condition very quickly 
[02:28:30]  because I was still very, you know, turned on by the situation at hand.  Good.  Then you got to make sure there's no fucking residue left in the fucking chamber.  You know, you can't just get right back in because, you know, there's some shit in there still.  Yeah, some glue.  Get pregnant.  Got some glue left over.  Pregnant.  You want to do a racist WWE wrestler?  Of course.  Or bee stings.  I say racist.  Really?  Well.  So WWE's going to an angle where they have a racist wrestler? 
[02:29:00]  Well, basically, yeah.  They got this guy who's been in the company for a while as, like, an all-American guy.  As a jobber?  Kind of.  He's never really.  They've tried everything with him and nothing has stuck.  He's just been a jobber and they finally give him an opportunity?  Like, he used to, at one point, he came to the ring with a guy dressed as an eagle, like  a mascot.  They've tried everything with this guy.  And nothing sticks.  Nothing sticks.  So finally, they're like, okay, we have a world champion who's a Mexican guy. 
[02:29:30]  We're going to give this guy a manager who's like a racist.  Oh, no.  And then he'll put you in the world title match and you'll be a main event guy and everybody  was buying it.  Wow.  All right.  And we got some examples of him being this guy?  Yeah.  His manager's name is Zeb Coulter.  So he doesn't actually wrestle?  Not the manager.  That's his manager.  Zeb Coulter.  Wait, who's the racist guy?  Technically, they both are because, you know, but the manager is the one who does the talking  because this guy has a lisp. 
[02:30:00]  So the manager's racist and the wrestler's racist?  Right.  But we're going to hear the manager?  The manager's the mouthpiece, you know.  Gotcha.  Okay.  America was built as the land of opportunity, a land where decent, law-abiding, respectful  citizens could work hard, pay their taxes, and provide a better way of life for their  families.  But somewhere along the way, that land of opportunity has turned into a desert of despair. 
[02:30:30]  And why?  Tell them why.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Because we have allowed a bunch of greedy, selfish, criminal delinquents to cross our  borders and rob this great country of all its wealth.  They drive across our borders with a carload full of kids, live 20 to an apartment with  their hands out, looking for a handout, preying on the generosity and the hospitality of Americans.  And quite frankly, what that has done has drained this country, not only of its resources, 
[02:31:00]  but its productivity.  I say no more.  No more.  And if you're looking for a handout, Jack Swagger, Zeb Coulter, we're charitable people.  We'll give you a handout.  That handout will be a one-way ticket back to wherever you came from.  Oh, damn.  God, he's not selling it at all.  Nice.  Horrible.  A horrible delivery, Sam Robertson. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know as much about wrestling as you.  Well, then he comes out also and he complains about America being taken over by people who  don't look like him.  Right.  You know, they can't specifically go and say, you fucking Mexicans.  We know what he means to the Mexicans.  Right.  Well, Zeb's got a lot of fan mail so far from Rush Limbaugh.  Rush Limbaugh.  Bags of it.  Or Alex Jones, for that matter.  Glenn Beck, I think, or Alex Jones, as you see Tanya O'Brien now.  Yeah, they're trying to go after that whole, like, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh. 
[02:32:00]  He's like a tea partier.  That's why he's on, like, Fox News and all this stuff.  Yeah, they're trying to do a little of that.  So, yeah, so that's when they're wrestling, the play-by-play guys.  And WWE thinks that's going to work.  The guy can't sell it at all.  It's totally working.  And then the wrestler himself, they don't give him any lines to say.  But the wrestler's not, I mean, but it's completely working because it's all over mainstream.  Well, we know why it's all over, you know, that'll be the punchline of this bit.  But first we got to do the Alex Jones part.  And Alex Jones took exception to.  That he was mentioned in this whole fucking wrestling storyline. 
[02:32:30]  He took exception to it.  Storyline, sorry.  And by the way, that three-second clip where they mentioned his name just now.  That's it?  Yeah.  That's every Alex Jones mention that's ever been on wrestling.  At all.  How many videos has he done already about it?  Well, you just listen in his rant at what he.  And someone doing a fucking work is pissed at someone doing a work.  Exactly.  Come on.  Do you know that Jack Swagger, the villain of the WWE, he said there's a bunch of videos. 
[02:33:00]  I'm going to do a quick report on it.  They get up there and discredit the Tea Party with Gadsden flags and say really ridiculous stuff like, you know, all Mexicans are bad.  I love Alex Jones.  He didn't say that.  These guys.  He didn't say that.  I love Alex Jones.  The announcer was saying.  I miss lying DJs.  You miss them?  I so miss them.  We've come across so many of these lying DJs.  Lying.  They'll take one tiny little thing and just completely over the top exaggerate.  Blow it out of proportion, exaggerate it, twist it. 
[02:33:30]  I'm sure we've done it ourselves over the years, but not as much as like, you know, you know who the guys are.  I know.  People are like, hey, Brad Bobbing.  If a wrestler came out and said, I love Alex Jones, the vast majority of the audience would be like, who the fuck is he talking about?  True.  Yes.  And his manager has a Yosemite Sam voice like, why I eat some rabbits?  But it's like, why I eat some Mexicans? 
[02:34:00]  But I love me some Alex Jones.  Oh, you Mexican.  I love Rush Limbaugh.  Boo!  What's he talking about?  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  What if that was what you heard?  Right.  And I mean, he doesn't do a different voice than what you heard.  And he's never done a promo where he says, I love Alex Jones. 
[02:34:30]  And the one guy looks like Mick Foley without his fucking beard.  A little bit.  Oh, I see.  He does have the crazy, I'm a redneck mustache.  Oh, the Yosemite Sam mustache.  All right.  I can see that.  Well, that's what the WWE thinks a redneck looks like.  Right.  They're definitely going for that.  It's the cartoon version of things.  It's wrestling.  It's everything.  Yeah.  Right.  Cartoon version of everything.  Of everything.  Right.  A black tag team called Crime Time.  I love it.  Well, Alex Jones continues, even though his name was mentioned in passing. 
[02:35:00]  By the announcer and never by these guys.  By Michael Cole.  Right.  Yeah, Michael Cole.  Randomly.  What's the big deal?  Well, on a bad day, it's got 14 million viewers.  14 million viewers.  Now, on a good day, Piers Morgan has half a million.  The Piers Morgan thing was big because it got picked up on.  Oh, man.  Wait, Piers Morgan only has a half million viewers.  Is that true?  I've heard that.  I've heard CNN is in the shithurve.  That means we talk to more people every day than CNN?  Yeah.  Nah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but CNN doesn't do fucking shit. 
[02:35:30]  Fox News blows them all away.  All of them.  It's amazing.  CNN is just good at getting their little interview clips on different websites.  Right.  Because the Piers Morgan clips end up everywhere, but nobody actually watches the interviews.  No one watches the show.  Right.  Exactly.  I've never watched Piers Morgan, but I've seen plenty of clips from his show.  There was a great report on a drone, though, on CNN.  Yeah, yeah.  Their daytime stuff is usually good.  Apparently some guy, for his purposes, it was photography or something. 
[02:36:00]  I don't know.  You're going to bump up in your numbers for being on CNN?  No.  Well, they plugged the wrong YouTube channel.  They did, yeah.  When they were showing Ant's footage?  Yeah.  OP Radio.  No, it didn't say OP Radio.  I was just asking.  Did they plug OP Radio by accident on YouTube?  No.  No, they put like Anthony Cumia.  Right.  Instead of O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Oh, fuck.  That was your big moment.  That was my big moment.  Fuck.  My big fucking moment. 
[02:36:30]  That sucks.  Could have been iPhone 5.  iPhone 5.  Could have been.  Wait, did you get more views because of that?  Did people go and at least try to find it on their own?  I don't even check.  You should have.  I swear I have no idea.  Just see if you got a little bump up.  Eh.  Did you know if you did?  Did you know what the count was?  Well, it's got six propellers and a camera.  I like seeing that I got a little bump up here and there.  It's kind of fun.  72,000 views on this thing.  That's a lot.  All right.  That's not bad. 
[02:37:00]  What do you mean that's not bad?  That's huge.  I don't think it was at that.  No, because the other ones are like 16,000.  Dude, I think that's what you usually get.  Dude, I think you got a bump up.  Oh, man.  That one got a little bump up.  You got a bump up from CNN.  Absolutely.  Because the rest of them are, you know.  Yeah, they sit there at like 15.  16, 20-ish.  Unless that one lady from CNN watched it 64,000 times.  Maybe.  To make sure there wasn't anything shock jock-ish in there.  Lurid.  Yes, lurid.  I'm glad you asked, Sam.  If my video does 20,000, I consider it a success. 
[02:37:30]  Anything less than 20,000, I think it's a bust of room.  Yeah.  Didn't think you were there.  Thanks for asking.  We were talking to him.  Thanks for asking.  Thanks for asking.  Here's more on Alex Jones and this whole dumb WWE thing.  Now, on a good day, Piers Morgan has half a million.  The Piers Morgan thing was big because it got picked up on hundreds of outlets.  Jay Leno, you name it.  Okay?  But Piers Morgan, half a million.  WWE, 14 million.  I mean, wow.  And that's Vince McMahon, who's a big establishment rhino Republican. 
[02:38:00]  He's a billionaire with his form of theater, men in tights, ballet.  And all of this is going on.  You got about, you know, a large portion of the audience that thinks it's real.  I've known adults that will call in and go, it's real.  No.  No, it's real.  No, they don't.  All right.  We got to stop this.  Still real to me, guy, maybe.  There's a couple things in here.  What did he say?  Ballet?  Man in tights with ballet.  Man in tights, yeah.  Just being passive aggressive.  He, even if he went into the ring as their play acting, whatever you want to call it, 
[02:38:30]  he would get his ass kicked.  Oh my God.  By the guys in tights doing ballet.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about real blows.  Just trying to like do what the fuck these guys do.  He would hurt himself bad.  Just falling on the mat.  Yeah.  Right.  His whole back would be thrown out.  And then is that, you think he's ever taken a phone call from somebody that goes, no,  it's real.  It's still real to me.  What percentage of people think it's real still?  The kids to watch.  Adults don't think pro wrestling is real. 
[02:39:00]  No.  But what percentage of their audience?  If they're doing 14 and a half million, that's the viewers.  How many do you think realistically think it's real?  Only kids that are probably seven, eight year old kids.  I give them up to 10.  10?  Kids under 10.  That's it.  There's no adults that think pro wrestling is real.  Right.  So, an extremely small percentage.  And that's the very, very young demos.  The real problem is that people think Alex Jones is real.  Do people think that, like, Alex Jones really believes the things he says? 
[02:39:30]  Eric Nagel thinks it's real.  It's still real to me, damn it.  All right.  Cover your ears.  I want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  That's why I made it a part of the clip.  Failed it out of the clip.  Take it easy, man.  You know why?  Because you know those wrestlers don't give a fuck. 
[02:40:00]  They're probably all pilled out, and he has to, like, make believe and go, take it easy, man.  Dude, can I hear that whole clip again?  Take it easy, man.  Wrestlers are so sick of wrestling.  Yeah, of course.  They're so sick of it.  Of course.  I got to hear that again.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be.  Thank you.  Take it easy, man.  You're awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Funk, for saying what needed to be said.  Say it. 
[02:40:30]  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thank you.  All right.  Get this fucking lunatic out of you.  Crying in Terry Funk's lap.  Oh, did he fucking lose it right there?  Jesus.  Take it easy, man.  Take it easy.  Take it easy.  I guess maybe he called in to Alex Jones' show.  Maybe.  I mean, no, it's real, man.  And I heard some guy saying it's still real to him.  He's crying.  It's real. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  Let's listen to Alex.  Men in tights, ballet.  Ballet.  And all of this is going on.  He got about, you know, a large portion of the audience that thinks it's real.  I've known adults that will call in and go, it's real.  No.  No, it's real.  It's real.  No.  And I'm like, really?  I've seen somebody body slammed who was in a coma.  I mean, this is not real.  Okay, I'll assure you, grown men who are six foot eight pounding each other in the face one time.  Blood's going to be pouring everywhere. 
[02:41:30]  No, it ain't.  But almost all these folks have never been in a real fight.  They're like little arrested development, toddling pot bellies.  He is stealing open Twitter voice.  We're going to go to the matter of white, Hispanic, black.  It's like, it's the same.  They look the same.  They act the same.  It's real.  Let's go watch the big guy fight.  It's real.  I mean, most of them got about 80 IQs.  They're borderline mentally retarded.  I mean, I'm very sad about this.  He wanted to say retarded so bad.  He said mentally retarded.  Why, he scared to say retarded?  And he said it's a fact.  Like, you know, he goes through all his facts. 
[02:42:00]  And one fact is that most wrestling fans are mentally retarded.  With an IQ of 80 or less.  I don't believe for a second that anyone thinks it's real above the age, like you said.  But by the way, Alex Jones has never said something truer than that, by the way.  Most wrestlers would agree with that, too.  Exactly.  So Vince was counting on this whole thing, right?  The racist wrestler and manager combo.  Vince was jizzing on himself when it was working. 
[02:42:30]  Because Fox News actually reported on it earlier in the week when it was just this story.  Right.  And Alex Jones is reporting on it.  And he's like, okay.  It's giving it a lot of heat.  And Vince loves heat.  And there's a big Hispanic demo.  Sure.  And so all the Hispanics are like, fuck that guy.  You know, and it's working.  But some of the greatest WWF moments were, you know, Sgt. Slaughter and fucking Iron Sheik.  Yeah.  All that stuff was very racial. 
[02:43:00]  Sgt. Slaughter sympathized with Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War.  It was great.  During the Gulf War.  It was amazing shit.  They had to change the arena for WrestleMania that year.  Because they were going to do an outdoor stadium.  But the security risks were too high because Sgt. Slaughter kept getting real death threats.  Because people think it's real.  So they had to put it into a small...  Well, back then they definitely thought it was real.  Iraq, yes.  DX came out in blackface making fun of Nation of Domination. 
[02:43:30]  In blackface.  So they've done this.  But what's the twist on this whole story?  This is the best part of it.  The twist is, so like I said, this guy Jack Swagger, he's been there forever.  And he finally got his moment in the fucking sun to shine.  This is the opportunity that every...  Vince is loving it, getting some heat.  You got Fox News talking about it, which only helps up WrestleMania because it's leading to WrestleMania, right?  And he's in one of the main events for WrestleMania.  Right.  Who is he going to fight?  Alberto Del Rio.  No idea.  World champion.  Oh, that's the Mexican or whatever.  Yeah, this is it.  Gotcha. 
[02:44:00]  This is what every person in the locker room is waiting for.  Gotcha.  And then on Tuesday, leaving the SmackDown tapings, he gets arrested for DUI and possession of marijuana.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Which guy?  Jack Swagger, the wrestler.  The wrestler.  They can't even write off the manager and just have Jack Swagger continue.  Right, because at least they could figure out the manager and get another racist manager in there.  Why would they make that the storyline when it interferes with the other storyline?  The problem is it wasn't the storyline. 
[02:44:30]  So you're saying it's real.  That part...  So you're proving Alex Jones' point.  You're saying wrestling's real.  No.  The DUI is real.  Oh, stop it, Sam.  That's insane, right?  Right.  Nothing really happens.  The guy couldn't keep himself together?  No.  There's a...  Oh, boy.  Looks like Chris Jericho.  That's a hell of a mug shot.  It looks like old school Chris Jericho in that shot.  How tall is he?  He's tall.  He's like...  I don't know.  Is that 100 inches?  Yeah, 80, 90, 102 inches. 
[02:45:00]  I think he's like 6'6", 6'7".  I'm too tired to do the math.  102 inches.  6 foot would be the 72 inches.  Then you've got to throw another 30 onto there.  He's not 7 1⁄2 feet tall.  Sorry, he's 7 1⁄2 feet tall.  He's definitely not 7 foot tall.  7 1⁄2 feet tall.  102 inches is 7 1⁄2 feet.  Sorry, he's 7 1⁄2 feet tall.  He's about 6'6", and you go, okay, a little math.  All right, so he's 7 1⁄2 feet tall. 
[02:45:30]  So he's a 7 1⁄2 foot tall wrestler.  That's tall, man.  How the fuck did he even get in the car to do some drunk driving?  That was like Andre.  Bleh.  You know that, I mean, WWE has no idea what they're going to do with him  because they haven't made any, like, announcement.  Their wellness thing that they said that every wrestler has to abide by  says that he has to be suspended for 30 days.  Wow.  Zero tolerance policy.  Which kills the whole build for WrestleMania. 
[02:46:00]  By the way, you know, it was funny,  but 30 more inches would actually be 2 1⁄2 more feet, right?  Yeah.  All right, so he's 8 1⁄2 feet tall.  Holy shit.  He's 8 1⁄2 feet tall.  Remember the Big Show who was in here?  Yeah.  He's a foot taller than the Big Show.  He says it right there, 102 inches.  Wow.  That's it.  Do a little math.  Do the math.  102.  So he's 8 1⁄2 feet tall.  That's incredible.  So that makes it almost impossible to get in the car.  That's crazy.  But he was able to do that. 
[02:46:30]  Maybe he wasn't drunk.  He was just looking at the sunroof.  He couldn't see.  Did he take out the driver's seat and he just drives from the back seat?  Yeah.  Oh.  He's got really long legs.  Nice.  Oh.  So he got arrested.  So what are they going to do?  I'm sure that they have no idea.  Nah, Vince doesn't give a fuck about that moral crap.  No, but he gives a fuck about bad publicity.  He's trying to do like a family show.  And so it's one thing if they're playing a character because the statements on him have  been like, it's a fictional character.  How is it a family show if you're teaching the kids to hate Mexicans? 
[02:47:00]  Because they're not.  How is that family programming?  Because he's the villain.  So it's bad to hate Mexicans.  All right.  So now the villain is a drunk asshole.  You can't be smoking weed.  You can't.  You can't.  It made him at WrestleMania.  It's perfect.  It really is perfect.  If he's the villain, now he's just a, you know, a drunk driving pot smoking asshole.  Bring him in.  Right.  Bring him in.  He doesn't have him come to the ring all fucked up all the time.  Yeah.  With his manager and he's just making weed smoking signs. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, man.  Like, they could have him actually maybe drive down the ramp in a little car and he's smashing  into the fences and shit.  Alberto Del Rio drives a car to the ring.  Oh, God.  Jack Swagger just gets in it and just drives it drunk.  I'm so glad I don't watch this anymore.  That's hilarious.  Let me say hi to Daniel or, is it Daniel?  Yeah, Daniel.  Right.  Right.  Oklahoma City.  Is that you?  Yeah.  All right.  What do you got?  Well, regarding WWE's wellness policy, you actually only get fined for weed, but you 
[02:48:00]  get suspended for, like, fake weed, like synthetic K2 weed and stuff like that.  Right.  That's why, like, Warren and Randy Orton, they have two strikes, because they're idiots and  they won't just smoke real weed.  But you get a suspension if you get busted with it.  Ah.  If the cops bust you, then you're fucked.  Yeah.  We're going to write this into the storyline.  So he could still wrestle?  I mean, it's not, you know, it's their wellness policy, so they can do whatever they want, 
[02:48:30]  really.  He'll wrestle.  The angle's too good for Vince.  It's really good.  All right.  Thank you, Daniel.  See you, guys.  You're going to get stoned before all your mansions.  Someone's saying we've got to play the audio of him actually talking.  That's really bad.  Of Jack Swagger?  Yeah.  Because he's got his lisp?  I don't know.  All right.  Do you have it somewhere?  I got it right here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  If he has a lisp, why didn't we start with this?  Yeah.  We love laughing at lisp.  Oh, do we ever.  Sorry.  Is it lispuses at that point? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Lispuses.  Lispuses.  Lispuses.  Fizz.  Fizz.  I want to introduce.  Oh, Jesus.  Age cries.  Did I waste your time with all that other nonsense?  Yes.  Yes, you did.  We lost half our audience because we're talking about wrestling, but we would have kept him  if we started with this.  He was probably sober.  The fucking cops probably thought he was slurring with that.  Right.  Hey, officer.  Sir.  Oh, my God.  Let's go with this for a little bit. 
[02:49:30]  I want to introduce a friend of mine.  He's a native and a great American.  How do you put a lisp on the word great?  Great.  Great.  That's a tough one.  He's got a weird one.  It's a weird.  I don't think there was a lot of speech therapy class for the young Jack Swagger.  No.  American. 
[02:50:00]  Zeb.  Coulter.  You need to hear Zeb talk more, do you?  No, it's great.  I love thinking about what goes on behind the scenes.  And you know, Vince sat Zeb down and said, you're going to grow that mustache.  Grow it out.  Why, Vince?  Oh, don't worry about it now.  I didn't want you shaving for three years.  And then finally, don't ask questions.  And then he comes to work one day with just a big, awful beard. 
[02:50:30]  And then Vince fucking makes him into that.  That beard, that's good shit.  That's good shit.  That's good shit right there.  I miss when Vince used to call us out.  People are going to love it.  All right.  We're going to break.  That's enough wrestling shit.  That's good, though.  That was good stuff.  Yeah.  Really good.  Great.  So we got an eight and a half foot wrestler.  You want more lisping real quick?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  There's an eight and a half foot guy lisping.  Mm-hmm.  My fellow Americans.  He just added a lisp to my. 
[02:51:00]  My fellow Americans.  My fellow Americans.  Last night is what happens when you live with dignity, respect, and patriotism last night.  Oh, that is a tough one.  I not only conquered the elimination chamber, but I put the weight of our nation upon our shoulders.  Shoulders. 
[02:51:30]  Not enough.  It just goes to show you that if you're tall, WWE will do whatever they can to get you in  the main event.  Eight and a half feet tall, especially.  Eight and a half feet.  Yeah.  Is that the tallest wrestler ever?  Eight and a half feet?  Yeah.  It's just about.  I don't think it's gotten any taller than eight and a half feet tall.  Who's second tallest of all time?  Probably El Gigante.  El Gigante.  Gigante.  How tall was he?  He's about ten.  Ten.  Seven foot nine.  Is he the dead guy?  Ten.  I don't think he's dead. 
[02:52:00]  One of the really tall wrestlers died.  I remember that.  Not Andre.  There was another one, I think.  E-Rock knows.  Tell me.  Heidi McTallerson?  Yes.  Giant Gonzalez?  What?  That's what we just said.  El Gigante was the same guy.  Oh, my God.  He just isn't listening again.  He doesn't listen.  I didn't know that he had another name.  E-Rock.  That's like you.  E-Rock and Eric Nagel.  It'd be like if I said, yeah, sex bagel is fat, and then you guys were just like, we just  said E-Rock is fat.  It's the same guy.  I know, but I...  Did you hear that fat joke?  I thought that was uncalled for today. 
[02:52:30]  No, it wasn't.  I don't like when they come out of nowhere.  I'm not a fan of that.  Stop saying it.  Slabo!  You created a monster with that.  You know, Roland is now getting random people who don't listen to the show, who just work  here at desks to walk into E-Rock's office.  Roland is promising to buy people burgers if they walk into E-Rock's office and yell  Slabo at him.  Are they the same people that laugh at us?  E-Rock hates it. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, I mean, they all know about you.  Oh, man, look.  They were looking in here, and people are walking by.  What?  The shade people must really laugh.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck they think gonna happen on the way to the bathroom?  Ain't nothing gonna happen on the way to the bathroom, motherfucker.  The way to the bathroom.  Yo, I gotta guard the bathroom, nigga.  You stupid.  You stupid.  You have a new Black History if you want to play it to break.  Oh, a new one.  Yeah, we could do that.  Yes.  I love these. 
[02:53:30]  We could do that.  It's the only thing that gets me through the month of February.  Let's do it.  And then we're gonna do bee stings when we get back.  And then we're gonna start our fucking weekend.  Noice.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of  the great African-American inventors.  Today, we honor Jay Standard, inventor of the refrigerator.  Hey, thanks for coming over.  Sit down.  Enjoy the food.  Woo.  I'm about to get my grub on, kid.  What the fuck? 
[02:54:00]  This shit is rotten, nigga.  Who you think you fucking with, yo?  Whoa, whoa.  I'm sorry.  It's just the meat's been sitting out for days.  I mean, what else do you expect?  I expect you not to be a fucking idiot and eat at my crib next time.  I invented the refrigerator, kid.  Keep that shit chill while you chilling.  That sounds much better.  We'll eat at your house next time.  Good.  Your wife is already here.  What?  Why?  The Refrigerator.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives. 
[02:54:30]  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  News of the world.  Opie and Anthony.  Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Silver screen heavy hitter Donald Sutherland was on the Opie and Anthony Show and had a ball.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  I feel totally alienated.  And you actually have listeners.  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all he was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him. 
[02:55:00]  When I came in here, I was terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald!  Donald!  Before you leave us, tell us, please.  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony?  Did I have fun here?  Oh, I'm so happy it's finished.  Stay tuned as News of the World continues to take an inside look at the lives of silver screen studs and starlets  on Opie and Anthony, Hollywood radio show to the stars. 
[02:55:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Tell the story.  Great.  Yeah.  Oh, Living Dead Girl.  I want to remind Sam and the audience that one day out of the blue, we're going to do a little Taste of Jocktober, right? 
[02:56:00]  It's going to strike when you least expect it.  Ah.  The people know that this is going to happen.  I suggested this a couple weeks ago at this point, I think.  Right.  Which means that you guys can suggest Jocktober suggestions to me on Twitter at any moment.  You know, I get the feedback from the listeners.  They love Jocktober.  And what put it over the top for me, I was out in L.A. doing the Joe Rogan podcast.  I had a really good time doing that.  And he was obsessing about how great Jocktober was.  And then it occurred to me, I'm like, man, why do we wait until October?  I know.  When you can surprise us with one. 
[02:56:30]  Not a lot.  Just every once in a while, you pop us and go, guess what, guys?  Today is a surprise.  Jocktober Day, or whatever the fuck we'll call it.  If it's going to make Joe Rogan happy, I got a lot more motivation now.  Yes.  Mr. Arock?  How popular Jocktober is online.  If you try to look for anything related to Scott and Todd, it's only the portions of  this show dealing with Scott and Todd.  Slabo!  Oh.  Really?  Yikes.  Well, you called me out on it, so now I got a fucking hammer at home.  Boom!  Ha ha. 
[02:57:00]  You shouldn't have made light of it.  You shouldn't have started it.  Oh, wait.  Slabo!  With another good one.  Slabo.  Started it.  It wasn't a great one, but...  No?  No, it wasn't a good one.  You have a good radio story?  I love radio stories.  Yes.  This is like being a kid and then your dad reads you a nice little story.  A nice story.  I love when Sam brings up radio stories.  I know.  It's cute.  Because I learned so many different stories.  And I think people are in on this one, because I think they do remember this one.  We have a history.  In the hunt for Jocktober, you know, I look at all kinds of shows. 
[02:57:30]  Now, this is just a story.  I don't have any audio to match, unfortunately, and I've tried, but there just isn't right now.  Is your source good?  Yeah.  The source is the source.  This is all factual.  Okay.  Okay.  So, you guys remember Chunky, right?  Chunky was a guy that worked at K-Rock after we...  K-Rock, right.  ...told those guys to go fuck themselves.  That's right.  That's how it went down.  Yeah, yeah.  And you guys made...  And what, they changed the format after we left?  Well, yeah.  K-Rock became 92.3 now.  That was where Nick Cannon worked. 
[02:58:00]  Is he still there?  How's he doing?  Nick Cannon quit radio.  Why?  He was too tired.  It's a tough job.  He was like, you know what?  Maybe I'll just make the America's Got Talent money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And just spend time fucking Mariah Carey.  Oh, did they blow it with that show?  Oh, my God.  What a dumb move.  What happened?  It's these stupid shows that should last forever.  They just fuck up the formula.  American Idol, I was watching that for...  I'm not even gonna...  And I swear, for two minutes.  And the judges just...  It just didn't look right to me. 
[02:58:30]  Dude, I can't even watch American Idol anymore.  It's Mariah.  It's the guy that decided I ain't leaving until you tell me to get the fuck out of here.  Randy Jackson.  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  Nicki Minaj and Keith Urban.  They look out of place.  They don't...  It just...  They have zero chemistry.  Right?  Zero.  And I don't think you go with the four judges.  You gotta go with the fucking formula.  Why would you change the formula?  Three judges.  Every other show has three judges.  Yeah.  And they used to have three judges.  And you heard who's replacing Sharon? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, that's what...  They blew it.  That show's gonna fucking fall off so fast.  Well, it fell off badly last sem...  Last semester.  Last semester.  Last season.  There's a bunch of college guys talking.  Ratings were way down.  But of course, the people that are involved with that show have to spin it.  I understand.  You gotta spin it to make it look good.  But the fact is, the ratings were down almost 30%.  And Sharon Osbourne is leaving.  And they brought in Mel B.  Mel B.  A.K.A.  I call her Mel B.  From Scary Spice.  Exactly. 
[02:59:30]  Why would you do that?  Why?  That's...  Nobody's interested.  No one cares.  You gotta find another matriarch.  Matriarch.  You gotta find a sweet matriarch that you know would fucking, you know, blow a guy.  Oh, God.  Well, that was the vibe she gives.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, she's got a little sexuality to her.  A little sexuality.  Yeah.  As far as the matriarch goes.  And after the MTV show, she became, like, a reality household name.  Yeah.  Like, people are interested in what she does.  But Mel B., to replace Sharon Osbourne, you've heard it here first, man. 
[03:00:00]  That show is gonna be fucking over.  Yeah.  In a tank.  Yep.  You're always saying that because you don't like Howard!  And do you think, uh...  Jealous!  Jealous!  That's hilarious.  You think Christina Aguilera has any hope of getting back on The Voice?  I heard she's taking a semester off.  Yeah, but she got...  Not a semester.  But she's been...  I'm just going with the semester thing now. 
[03:00:30]  I like that.  You know who's replacing her for the semester?  Who?  Shakira.  Who's gonna want to start looking at fat Christina Aguilera?  Oh, true.  After they had a shot to spend a season looking at Shakira.  You mean Snooki with blonde hair?  Exactly.  Nobody goes back.  Snooki with blonde hair.  Think about it.  You'll be in on that one.  I hear you.  No, they're just fucking up all those shows.  And those shows should have lasted forever.  Those shows were so no-brainers.  Yeah.  So no-brainers.  That makes sense, I guess.  So, Chunky.  Chunky, who used to work at... 
[03:01:00]  92.3 Now.  After it was K-Rock, yes.  Right.  Yes.  We made fun of him when they first flipped because what they did for that station was...  They brought all the guys in from Detroit.  I really gotta call.  I missed the last one.  I kind of have to pee, too.  Why don't you tell the audience this story?  I don't care.  You really want me to tell the whole story?  How funny would they be if you guys just left?  Honestly, I didn't even care.  And this isn't even a waste of time because I know the Beasting thing will get us to 10  o'clock today.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, Chunky.  Okay.  They brought their jocks in from Detroit. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  They brought the whole station from Detroit.  This is a radio move, by the way.  They do this all the time.  But Chunky went on, and like you always say, keep it local.  Right.  He just went on and started talking about whatever was out the window.  57th Street and whatever deli was near him.  Well, his whole job is to make it sound like, and I don't blame him because this is what  you have to do when you move around a lot in the business.  You got to make believe you were born and raised in that particular city.  Right.  To this day, people think we're from Boston.  That's how we pulled it off.  You did a good job.  Even though we didn't have the accents. 
[03:02:00]  But people really thought that we might have been from that area.  So they redid 92.3 Now again since we last left.  And Nick Cannon's obviously gone.  Chunky's gone.  Everybody's gone off that station.  They replaced everybody.  So there's some station in Philly, one of the top 40 stations, Wired something or Mix  something.  I don't know what it is.  But they got a new morning show.  And this thing popped up on their website that said, our boss doesn't know that we posted  this on the website. 
[03:02:30]  Why wouldn't he know?  I guess he doesn't have the internet.  Why wouldn't he know?  Of course he would know.  Fucking idiots.  He'd be privy to every move.  And they go, but we've decided to start our own morning show.  Oh, just like that.  Right.  Wonderful.  They said the boss wants us to shut up and play music, but we're going to do what we want  to do.  And that means more talk and more games and more prizes.  Right.  Because really, if you're going to have a pirate radio station, you want to give prizes out.  Of course you do.  You're going to give away my Sudoku puzzle today, right? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that's true.  See, we like giving out prizes as well.  So they announced, this is all on the website, that their new morning show staff, they've  decided to get a girl from the sales department and the guy hosting it is just going to be  the guy that sells him cheesesteaks at their local spot in Philly.  And there's a picture of the whole crew there together.  Right.  They're all just local Philly guys that are starting this morning show together.  Against the boss's wishes.  Yes, the boss.  Don't tell the boss about this if you're listening. 
[03:03:30]  And people wonder why we hate radio so much, even though we do radio.  The guy who sold the cheesesteaks for all those years?  Right.  It's Chunky.  Chunky!  It's Chunky.  Extra cheese!  Now he's pretending to be a Philly cheesesteak salesman, a local from Philly.  Poor Chunky.  I know.  Doesn't even know who he is.  No, he has no clue who he is.  Is he from Detroit, New York, or Philly?  Pick one.  He doesn't know anymore.  He's lost all sense of his personal identity.  Now he's a local cheesesteak guy in Philly. 
[03:04:00]  He's a guy who sells cheesesteaks in Philly now.  He just happens to have kind of a radio voice.  He's got no...  He isn't a person anymore.  Oh, what's his name for the show?  They're calling him Chunky.  They don't even change the name?  New York is right by Philly.  God.  And everybody's on the internet.  People are going to realize, no, this is a guy from New York.  I love radio stories.  That's just sad.  But it's amazing that...  Yes, E-Rock, raising your hand over there.  Oh, I didn't want to interrupt Sam.  I thought he was finished.  There's something else about some of the other people that's on his show. 
[03:04:30]  Two of them are left over from the previous show.  You just missed the most boring story ever.  Oh, man.  I was making believe it was cool.  Ah, I hate missing boring stories.  But you know what about the boring story?  What?  I told Opie the story before we went on the air, and then Opie was like, oh, you should  tell me on the air.  And then you're told on the air, and it didn't quite have that...  Well, you said it better off air.  It was the same story, both places.  It didn't have the spontaneity.  Sam gets so defensive. 
[03:05:00]  He does.  The story was funny.  I like the story.  Relax.  Opie gets nervous on the air, I think.  Do I?  Yeah.  No.  You get very defensive about your radio, though.  Always.  You really do.  Because I'm a warrior.  E-Rock's going to add to the terrific story.  Oh, good.  Yes, E-Rock.  E-Rock, comment.  All right, this is where I'm starting to get comfortable again.  E-Rock, comment.  No, I'm done.  What about this?  What the hell, man?  He had a tidbit.  Fuck.  I'll tell my whole story again.  I'm not chicken. 
[03:05:30]  This isn't the Delta House attitude.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Come on, E-Rock.  E-Rock, what the fuck?  Save us.  Give the tidbit.  E-Rock.  This whole new morning show that they decided they're going to do because the bosses wouldn't  let them do anything.  They're going to take it upon themselves.  Two of the people are left over from the show that they fired, so they were already on  the air.  But they're pretending to be brand new people at the radio. 
[03:06:00]  Even though the audience wouldn't know they're the same people?  Yes.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Radio is just the worst.  That stinks.  All right.  We're going to do bee stings, people.  Ooh.  You want to do bee stings?  I'd love to.  I used to love the show, My Strange Addiction.  I tapped out.  That's where the rock lady came from, right?  Who ate rocks all day long?  Yes.  Yes.  Remember her?  Is this better than rock lady?  It's stranger, I think.  I could more see eating rock than I could having bees sting me. 
[03:06:30]  I hate bee stings.  They're the worst.  I'm terrified of bees.  I'm petrified of them as a kid.  Still am.  When was the last time you got stung?  Oh, man.  When I was a kid.  Yeah.  Last year at my nephew's football game.  Oh, right.  You did get stung.  Went into a port-a-potty, and I saw the bee.  Sting your hiney hole?  Razor-sharp eyesight on the opster's part.  I see this thing in the corner of the port-a-potty as I'm taking a leak, and I saw it as it was  happening, going, holy fuck, he feels like he's fucking trapped.  And the famous bee line, I understand what that means now, man. 
[03:07:00]  Beeline right to my...  I forgot where I got stung now.  Holy fuck.  Whatever.  Between the first and second hole?  That old joke.  But fuck, it sucks every time, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not fun.  I'd rather have my hand hit with a hammer.  Ow.  That hurts, too.  Yeah, but I'd rather have that.  Yeah.  Something about just being stung.  It's just so violating.  Especially when you don't see it coming, when it just happens.  Oh, God.  I saw this one coming.  In the corner, I'm like, it wants out of here. 
[03:07:30]  And it's going to go through me, which means it's going to have to sting me.  Well, there's also the idea of a bee is a tiny thing, and you're a big person, and you're  looking at it like a battle.  You're like, I'm not going to lose to that little thing.  And you always do.  Why does it hurt so much?  Does anyone know?  I think it's venom.  It's your pride.  No, but the actual sting kind of hurts.  Barbed hook.  Well, then it gets itchy and all that shit.  But why does the actual sting hurt so much?  If it's so tiny.  It's not going into you.  But it's tiny.  It's got barbs on it.  Yeah, but I got a flu shot.  That didn't hurt.  Didn't have barbs on it. 
[03:08:00]  The bee sting hurts way more than a fucking flu shot.  Yeah.  And I think it is.  There is some little venom and stuff in there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's peppery.  There's also some venom in this room right now.  Sad.  It's not me.  It's you.  It's you.  No, it isn't.  It's so you.  No, I'm a positive, nice person.  Everybody comes on the after show and has a great time.  I'm not the venom.  The venom.  Venom.  Miracle on ice.  33 years ago today.  Here's bee sting lady, Margaret.  Margaret has been addicted to bee stings for the past 10 years. 
[03:08:30]  Okay.  Her addiction started innocently as a way to relieve her arthritis.  In search of relief from the pain.  Wouldn't you rather have the arthritis?  I don't understand these alternate ways to cure shit.  I don't get that either.  What kind of pain takes away pain?  You'd rather have a bee sting instead of the arthritis?  I'd rather have neither, but.  Would you believe somebody if they told you that?  You should try having a bee sting you.  No, they do this.  Really?  Yeah, this part is definitely true. 
[03:09:00]  We could easily get people on the phones right now that do bee sting therapy for arthritis.  Never heard of it, Sue.  Yeah, yep.  This lady literally picks up bees with tweezers and just kind of hits them.  Oh my God, can you imagine just having a bee in the tweezers and you know it's going  to sting you?  You're just waiting.  Get the fuck out of here.  How do you agitate the bee to sting you as it's in the tweezers?  She hits it on like the abdomen.  Do you squeeze those little bee balls?  That's what I was going to say.  The abdomen is very close to a little bee dick.  Poor little bee.  Do they have bee dicks? 
[03:09:30]  I'm sure.  They have little tiny little...  Come on, gay.  You're right.  Yellow and black testicles.  Talking about bee penises is gay too?  Yes, it is.  You never saw the Honey Nut Cheerios bee's dick and he was naked, right?  Well, it's a family commercial though.  Oh my God.  Okay.  Right.  They've got to cover that shit up.  Let's not fucking go there, guys.  They don't want kids going, Daddy, what the fuck is that?  Oh God.  Well, that's the bee's penis.  Right.  And you know what he does with the penis?  He shoves it in the female bee's ass.  Mmm.  Bee's fucking ass? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  They do.  That's what I used to think.  Pollinate that ass.  You've got to pollinate that ass.  Yeah.  In search of relief from the pain, Margaret turned to the beehives in her backyard.  I read how people have been using it to relieve certain pain symptoms.  The first time that I stung myself, it didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.  And it just got easier every time.  But what started as an occasional prick of pain for medical reasons has spiraled into 15 stings a day. 
[03:10:30]  There's a couple trigger points right here that I like to sting.  I kind of put a little dent in it with my fingernail.  I gently tap it on the abdomen.  And it comes away like that.  Holy fuck.  Can we put some beeps in this?  She just stung herself.  I'm hearing dicks, fuck myself, all sorts of shit in this.  We've got to beep this shit up.  That's crazy.  Can I see the video of her stinging herself to see if she even winces? 
[03:11:00]  Didn't sound like she...  She doesn't.  When she goes like...  When you hear her going...  Her addiction started...  That's her getting stinging.  That's her way to relieve her arthritis.  In search of relief from the pain, Margaret turned to the beehives in her backyard.  I had read how people have been using it to relieve certain pain symptoms.  The first time that I stung myself, it didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.  And it just got easier every time.  But what started as an occasional prick of... 
[03:11:30]  No wincing at all.  She likes it.  Can we just play the video?  You want to play this whole video?  How long is it?  Take...  Almost four minutes.  Oh, one, two, three, four.  We probably...  Well, you could...  With commentary, four minutes plus commentary.  We got 14 minutes left in the face.  I think we're okay.  You know what?  I really think we should probably play the whole video.  That's a little more constructive, you think?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Because I don't trust you.  You might edit out some good stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Because I usually edit out the good stuff, right?  You do.  Yeah.  I've been on to you for a while now.  Save it for me.  That's right.  All right.  I'm going to play from here, or do you want me to go to where we were?  No, this is good.  Okay.  Right from here.  Wait.  What happened?  Because we've already heard this clip, and the clip you just played.  Well, people probably forgot.  And new listeners all the time.  New listeners all the time, Sam Roberts.  Every 15 seconds.  We're turning over an audience.  Yeah.  Every 15 seconds.  Pearl Jam finally played fucking alive again, so people said, fuck that.  Let's see what O&A are doing. 
[03:12:30]  Right.  All right.  For those people.  Pain, for medical reasons, has spiraled into 15 stings a day.  There's a couple trigger points right here that I like to sting.  I kind of put a little dent in it with my fingernail.  I gently tap it on the abdomen, and it comes away like that.  She's killing the bees, too, by the way.  Yeah.  She's always had kind of a taste for looking at the odd side of that.  Poor J.D.  Can you stop this? 
[03:13:00]  I feel bad for J.D. and his weird mustache.  Look at his wife is stinging herself.  Because I always like to think that the relationship certainly didn't start with this.  Right.  And all of a sudden, you wake up one day, and you're in some weird hell.  You're like, what the fuck?  How did he get to this point?  Stinging herself.  My wife is stinging herself 15 times a day.  Because of her arthritis.  Right.  Yeah.  He was dating like a 20-something.  And then she got arthritis, and then she started getting bees to sting her.  They probably went and saw a bunch of Leonard Skinner concerts while they were dating. 
[03:13:30]  Stinging.  Yeah.  He was stinging her pussy with his dick.  That's right.  You tell him, Anthony.  The only stings she wanted.  He fucked her in the back of a car.  Oh, yeah.  Probably.  He certainly did.  Right in the ass.  You think in the ass as well?  Yeah.  He's an ass guy.  Oh, yeah.  He likes fucking throwing it where the shit comes out.  Oh, yeah.  Just like a bee.  That's right.  Yep.  He pulled his dick out.  It looked like when a stinger comes out of a fucking bee.  It's got some of that gack on it.  Ew.  That was right.  That's so gay. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  I think that was gay.  Gay.  How many minutes have we got?  Oh, we're going by the minute now?  It's commentary.  It's good.  Oh, okay.  It eats up the time.  Odd side of things.  At this point now, with 15 stings a day, that's when I'm starting to get really concerned  about this.  Margaret stings herself with bees over 100 times a week.  Wow.  That's more than 50,000 bee stings since her addiction began.  It doesn't take very long for it to turn into that peppery burn, and it actually feels 
[03:14:30]  good.  Oh, my God.  There's a little bit of swelling.  There's a little bit of itching, but there's good stuff happening.  Jeez, oh, Pete, honey.  Look at this thing.  Yeah, you can see it twitching.  Oh, this poor guy.  What the fuck's wrong with people?  He doesn't want to deal with this.  Fuck.  He doesn't want to deal with this.  He's staring at her.  He has to fucking placate to her bullshit.  Oh, yeah, look.  It is twitching a little bit.  This is normal. 
[03:15:00]  You fucking weirdo.  It's too bad they would take half my shit.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you get a divorce on the grounds of bee stings?  I don't know.  He didn't strike me as a type of guy who has a lawyer in his Rolodex.  That's true.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with people?  Margaret's so hooked on stinging herself with bees, she has hives in her backyard that keep  her stocked at all times.  She's got hives on her body, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear a hum. 
[03:15:30]  Love her.  She even uses a bee vacuum to make the chase easier.  When I open this little revolving door here, they can go in, but they can't go out.  And Margaret never leaves home without a supply.  I carry honeybees around with me in my purse, just in case I need a sting throughout the  day.  Ow.  Ow.  Is this sexual?  I don't know.  Maybe it is.  She made some sexual noises there.  She did.  There is reference to sex later. 
[03:16:00]  There is.  Jesus.  Interesting.  It might be sexual, yeah.  She's getting turned on by this.  All right.  Riding all up on the thigh like that with the stingers.  I wonder if she's ever, you know...  Stung her clit.  Her pussy lips.  You think so?  They get all fucking fat.  Close to the hood.  That's when her husband knew it was a problem when they were little welts.  Yeah.  On her labia.  Pussy lips.  On her labia majora.  Majora.  Yeah, she's pulling her dress up. 
[03:16:30]  Stinging her, like, hips.  High up on the hip.  Yeah, yeah.  Right on, like, the side ass cheek, too.  Nice.  That's where the bee likes to fuck.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  But every time Margaret stings herself, the honeybee dies.  Something Margaret is all too aware of.  Every bee is precious.  I get sad when I watch them die.  I prefer to get an older bee.  The younger bees, they've got their lives ahead of them.  Pause.  Wait, you gotta wait.  Why is she fucking playing the flute?  Give it two seconds. 
[03:17:00]  This crazy old fraud.  She's playing the flute.  Next to the beehives.  Okay, so she's talking about how sad she is because the bees died.  Yes.  She's playing the flute, right?  Yes.  Okay.  I prefer to get an older bee.  The younger bees, they've got their lives ahead of them.  And it helps me feel less guilt about killing the bees.  Oh, Jesus.  She's crying.  She's in hysterics.  Someone has to deal with this shit.  She's sad that the bees are dying that she kills.  She's weeping like crazy.  You gotta hug her while you're putting calamine lotion on her. 
[03:17:30]  What a mess.  Are you kidding me?  Would you deal with this?  No.  How much does her husband pray that she develops an allergy to bee stings?  Oh, imagine what she'd do.  That would drive her nuts.  He just looks at Macaulay Culkin in My Girl and just gets jealous.  Oh, right.  Oh, no kidding.  That's like, she's getting fucking gang banged.  Yeah.  In that film.  She'd love that.  She would love that.  Oh, yeah.  For better or for worse, unless you're a freak of a wife is addicted to bee stings. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Can we fucking add that to the fowls, please?  No one should have to deal with this.  He should be, yeah.  He should be able to leave.  She's breaking down next to the beehive after she played the flute because she had to bury one of them.  Does she bury them?  No way.  No, she doesn't bury them.  She puts them on a paper towel and watches them twitch to death because their stinger's gone.  And then she goes and plays the flute next to the fucking hive?  And cries.  Why is she playing the flute next to the hive?  She loves the bees.  I don't think she loves them.  She's a serial killer. 
[03:18:30]  She is a bee mass murderer.  A bee serial killer, yeah.  Let's go.  Let's get through this.  No two stings are alike, but I feel relief from all of them.  But Margaret stings herself up to 15 times every day.  And her husband, J.D., is worried about the long-term effects.  Today, he wants to convince her to see a doctor before she does permanent damage.  Talk to your doctor about bee stings.  How do you think this is going to go through?  J.D.  She's going to be pretty violent toward J.D., probably. 
[03:19:00]  She don't want to stop doing this.  Maybe bring up something he's into or something.  Yeah.  I've only got one left.  Okay.  We need to talk about this some.  Oh, boy.  The folk medicine that we've been doing this with is great.  It's more than just folk medicine.  They make me feel better.  And when I haven't had a sting for a while, I get cranky.  But I don't want to have you pretty much tearing into the hive at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.  Because there's been many a morning you've woken up, walked around the house.  Simple statement. 
[03:19:30]  I would really like to get a sting right about now.  It gets to the point where ever we stop somewhere, you're automatically out of the car looking for bees.  This is really getting kind of intense.  Intense.  I am concerned about this.  They relieve my anxiety.  And they relieve so many other symptoms.  And you've got to admit, after I've had at least 10 stings, the sex is great.  That's true.  What?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Did you see the look away after that? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, see?  I told you.  Those two having sex and getting stung by bees and shit.  Bee sting.  She probably tries to convince him to get stung by bees.  Get stung under your cock.  Yeah.  Yeah, she wants it all swollen.  The life expectancy of a bee is only six weeks, but she's still looking for the old bees.  Yeah.  It's all relative.  I love the look.  Like, duh, of course.  See, I'm right again.  It's that shitty wife look.  Yeah.  Her pussy only gets wet when there's 10 bee stings in her body. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, man.  He's a bee cook.  The husband just sits around watching bees doing her.  He knows while he's having sex with her that she's thinking about bees.  Bees.  Bees.  I would put her in one of those, like, fucking bee fucking netting things.  Oh, so she can't get stung?  No, on a bed and then just fucking put a couple hundred bees in there.  That could be a turn on for everybody.  She would like that.  She would like that.  Not me, but maybe her husband.  Well, you being her husband, you're, you know. 
[03:21:00]  All right, I would like that if I was her husband.  Yeah.  If I was forced to be married to a fucking lady that was addicted to bee stings.  A lunatic.  Yeah, I think I would like that then, I guess.  Can you understand my concern here?  Yeah.  I just need to see what the long-term effects of this has been.  Let's go to a doctor on this.  There's the end of the clip.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute, but it's only.  When is the show on?  It was on on Wednesday.  Could you get more clips for Monday?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, because that's like a cliffhanger right there. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  How does it end?  Does she stop getting stung?  Hell no.  Does the husband leave her?  No, the husband just starts duct-taping bees to his dick and fucks her with the bee dick.  The bee dick.  She wants to be stung inside her vaginal canal.  Yeah.  That'd be interesting.  Yeah.  That's a good clip.  Yeah.  I love those dumb addictions.  Thank you, Sam.  Oh, fucking Sam.

Does it bother you so much to see that husband with the bee lady because of your mom driving  your family crazy?  Oh, that lady's way worse.  She is worse.  Fuck yeah.  Good.  Way worse.  Fuck yeah.  Mom's birthday tomorrow, I believe.  Ooh.  So I think I'm gonna do a little Long Island trip. 
[03:24:00]  Nice.  Maybe some FH Riley's, actually, if I could squeeze it in.  Oh.  Try to squeeze that shit in.  FH.  Isn't St. Paddy's Day coming up again?  Yeah.  When is that?  Good times.  That's a big, uh, a big night over at FH and in Huntington, right?  Yeah, there's a parade, so I gotta bring my son to the parade, I think.  Aw.  That'd be good.  I think that's it for this weekend, I think.  Might go to a kid's movie today at, I almost said the time and where I'm gonna be.  I don't want to deal with people today. 
[03:24:30]  No.  I mean, there's no, absolutely no reason.  I was so close to saying the movie at the time.  Gonna be there.  What the fuck?  Stop by, say hello.  And I love you people.  I really do.  So, I just leave my time to myself.  But, Opie, if you love the people, why do you say those horrible things about them?  No, I don't say horrible things as much anymore.  That's me.  I was in meditation class last night.  Just chilling the fuck out.  Did you see anything?  No.  Very, just a very silent feeling. 
[03:25:00]  Very silent.  There were 20 people in the room and it was very just silent.  It was nice.  Was anybody talking?  I was, I was, I forgot I was in a room with a lot of people.  Were your eyes shut?  Yeah, and then I kind of felt a little bit of vibration and then I felt like, I saw a  light that scared me because I think it was like my inner self or something.  Vibration.  And it took me out of the meditation.  And I also got scolded at because I looked at my phone.  You have your phone on you while you're doing meditation?  Yeah, but it was before the meditation part.  It's still like, aren't you supposed to like slowly kind of? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, they tell stories and stuff.  And then there was like a.  Stories.  There was kind of like, you know, an intermission, I think it's called.  Inter.  So I decided I would check my numbers.  We're all checking our numbers.  Check my numbers.  I call it checking my numbers.  You check it.  See how my YouTube videos are doing.  Sure.  All that shit.  Isn't the purpose of the meditation so that you don't care as much about that stuff?  And then she, I guess, I didn't get scolded, but I was, I was called to the front and 
[03:26:00]  and this person goes, I want you to stay.  I want you to stay.  I'm like, yeah, I'm here, man.  I'm leaving.  This is great.  Having a blast.  She goes, I want you to stay.  Stay, stay, stay in the room.  Stay.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  I'm staying.  No problem.  What she meant was like, don't.  And then she goes, you know.  Stay with me.  Yeah.  Don't look at your message.  She calls it.  Don't look at your messages.  I want you to stay.  Meaning stay in the moment.  What we just created.  The five minute break period is, you know, just so people could go to the bathroom and 
[03:26:30]  stuff.  But I figure if like people are taking dumps and making tea that I could fucking check  my numbers.  Right.  Lady, I'm not looking at messages.  I'm checking my numbers.  Nah, she was right though.  Why don't you stay just a little bit longer?  In the end, she was right.  Of course.  My elevator show started.  I got myself into something.  Now I got to come up with it.  Oh yeah.  Now you got to come up with an elevator show.  Every week.  Is it every once a week?  Yeah.  You want to do one?  What am I going to do?  That's the beauty of the show.  Whatever the fuck you want.  Anthony. 
[03:27:00]  Man.  Just, we come up with a concept and we do it.  First one's up on the Facebook page, E-Rock.  Yes, it is.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  My elevator show officially started.  Do we have to do it today?  How about Monday?  Why?  You got an idea today?  No.  I want to throw a hot wax on E-Rock in the elevator.  That'd be good.  Oh yeah.  That'd be really cool.  But he's mad at me now, so I don't know if I could ask him to do that.  Why is he mad at you?  I don't know.  The Slabo thing, I think.  Oh, you did call him Slabo a bunch of times.  Yeah, but it wasn't like it was out of nowhere though.  No, it was totally out of nowhere. 
[03:27:30]  Like, I didn't even know why you were saying it.  Right, E-Rock?  No, it was totally out of nowhere.  Bail's only got $114,000 for Oscar pissed.  You know, I said yesterday there's no way he's going to get off.  He's getting off.  You think he is?  Because it's South Africa.  I don't think they got their shit together like America.  And our judicial system is pretty shitty.  So you've got to imagine theirs is really shitty.  It'd be no bail.  He's their only star.  Yeah.  You can't put your only star away. 
[03:28:00]  No.  That would be really bad for the country.  So I'm starting to think he's going to get off or a very much lesser charge.  He might.  Maybe he has to do like, you know, a little time, but nothing crazy.  I don't think white chicks are looked at as very important down there either, to tell you the truth.  Really?  Yeah.  I think, you know, they could be murdered and it's just like, meh, whatever.  Wow.  What do you think?  There's no way he should have made bail if they found the shell casings in the bathroom.  I don't know.  Especially $114,000 doesn't sound like a lot of bail. 
[03:28:30]  Is it that wacky money?  Like he gets a bond and pays 10% cash?  I don't know.  Is it wacky money, though?  Yeah, what's their money?  I don't know.  Do they have the Krugerrand?  Sam's staring at the clock going, fuck, they're taking my time.  Come on now.  All right, we're going to start our weekends.  I think that you started at the clock going, fuck, I'm giving away time.  No, not really.  But I don't have anything else, really.  No.  I gave it my all today.  Every bit of it.  You guys left it all on the field today, gentlemen. 
[03:29:00]  And it really showed.  Maybe Roland will do an elevator fucking show video.  Roland's good.  He could pitch guests.  Yeah, that's true.  That we don't take.  Like George Lopez.  Pressure's on.  I've got to come up with a new one in six days.  George Lopez.  Fuck did I get myself into?  George Lopez won't be on the after show.  Won't be on the after show, you know?  He no show.  No George Lopez at all, huh?  All right, well.  Email Tom Skerritt.  He's going to check his schedule.  Oh, man.  What happened?  Email Tom Skerritt yesterday.  Hidden City's guys coming in finally? 
[03:29:30]  Damn.  Oh, yeah, March.  Tom Skerritt.  That means I'm going to finally post my videos?  Yeah.  I'd love fucking talking to Tom Skerritt.  Yeah, he's in Seattle.  Well, whatever.  He's a phoner.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a rare phoner.  We'll put him on the phone.  Oh, yeah.  No, I emailed him.  He said, I'm in transit all week.  I'll email you back soon.  Tom Skerritt?  Yeah.  Signed Tom Skerritt?  Oh.  You have Tom Skerritt's email?  Yeah.  I should have it.  I would talk to him about Alien.  He was Dallas in Alien.  Who was? 
[03:30:00]  I think he would be besties for email.  Yeah.  Is it Tom.Skerritt at AOL?  Oh, man.  Gmail.  Giving it away.  She blinded me with science.  I'll bet that guy laughs at you going to the bathroom.  It's Thomas Dolby.  What?  I'll bet that guy laughs at you going to the bathroom, too.  Oh, God.  Thomas Dolby guy laughs at us?  Every time we go to make fun of someone now, all I can think of is, well, they just  got that over us forever.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Have a good after show.  Yeah, Sam.  Have a good weekend.  It's going to be awesome.  Adios. 
[03:30:30]  Adios.  That was it, huh?  That was it, huh?  7.37 coming out of the sky.  Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride?  I won't move.  Playing in a traveling pain.  Yeah.  Well, I'm flying across the land.  Trying to get a hand.  Playing in a traveling band.  Take me to the hotel.  Bag is gone.  Oh, well, come on, come on.  Would you get me to my room?  I won't move. 
[03:31:00]  Playing in a traveling band.  Yeah.  Well, I'm flying across the land.  Trying to get a hand.  Playing in a traveling band.  Listen to the radio.  Talking about the last show.  Someone got excited.  Had to call a stay militia.  Won't move.  Playing in a traveling band.  Yeah.  Well, I'm flying across the land.  Trying to get a hand.  Playing in a traveling band.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Oh, well. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, well.  Here we come again on Saturday night.  Oh, well, you're fussing and you're fighting.  Won't you get me to the right?  I won't move.  Playing in a traveling band.  Yeah.  Well, I'm flying across the land.  Trying to get a hand.  Playing in a traveling band.  Oh, well.  I won't move. 
[03:32:00]  I'm playing in a traveling band.  Oh, I'm playing in a traveling band.  I'm playing in a traveling band.  Why'd you give me tell my hand  But I'm playing in a traveling band  I'm fine for the land  Trying to get a hand  Playing in a traveling band  Wow! 
[03:32:30]  Hey!  Sirius XR  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues  This is After Opie and Anthony Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Oh yes, oh yes  After Opie and Anthony Live  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number  I'll take some phone calls  Where's Alan? Where's the intern? 
[03:33:00]  He's in here  Bring him in here  I have an assignment for him  Alan's the intern that  E-Rock and Sal always give a hard time to  But he's always done good work by me  Did they give him a hard time rolling?  Oh yeah  Are you done?  Hey, Nicole  I need Nicole in here  Does she see me?  Good  Alan  Nicole, sit down for a moment  You remember Alan, the intern you said you'd have sex with?  Yeah  That's not why you're here, Alan  It's just a coincidence  I have an assignment for you 
[03:33:30]  It's not that, well, you can't have sex with Nicole if you want  But that's only, only if she gives you permission  And she'll tell me if she didn't give you permission  So don't try any of that rape stuff  Okay?  Do I have your word on that?  Yeah, my word  Okay, good  That's all I want  Now, I need you to go and find, right now  I don't care what you're doing  What are you doing right now?  I'm printing out pictures for Roland  You can do Sam Suffer's  Thank you, Roland  I need you to go out 
[03:34:00]  And I need you to find people  Preferably on-air personalities  But if they're not, I'll accept that too  I need you to find people  That have seen Club Soda Kenny  Escort Opie and Anthony to the bathroom  And I need you to bring them into this studio for me  Can you do that?  Yeah, sure  Where should I start?  I'll start with Rob Cross  No, I mean, don't start with Rob Cross  He works for the show  I don't need show staff  Getting in fights with them?  Over this?  It's the most absurd thing I've ever seen in my life  That's what I want  It's the most absurd thing I've ever heard  And I get to see it 
[03:34:30]  Because they have to walk by our studio  In order to get to the bathroom  In order to be escorted to the bathroom  Like they're five  Can you do that for me, Alan?  Can you do that right now?  I'll do that right now  What are you writing?  He looks like he's right on it  What are you writing down?  I just wrote down exactly what you told me  In case you forget  He's a mimbo  Because he may walk around  A mimbo  And like all of a sudden  He pokes his head into an office  And goes  I don't have any idea why I'm here  Yeah, but you know what?  I respect him for taking notes  As you wrote  That's a good worker  Yeah  I'm not that smart 
[03:35:00]  Right  I can't really remember anything  That's fine  That's why you wrote it down  Yeah  You're right  You're like Memento  Yeah  You have a whole bunch of tattoos  What's that, Alan?  Oh, this is just  Because every week you know  You're going to need cheese  You're going to need milk  You're going to need bread  So that's a list  That you tattoo on forever  Right  And then the other stuff  You just write as you go  Okay  Should I also check out  The Al Q guys  Or that's already settled  From earlier  It's already settled  And they're doing an interview  So I wouldn't bother them  I don't know  But I saw  I saw Nicole's friend Taylor 
[03:35:30]  Who works for Cosmo  She's probably just getting out  She went that way  Like she's in one of the production rooms  It's her birthday today  Oh my god  You gotta get Taylor in here  What does she look like?  She's like a chick  She's got long brown hair  She's got big blue eyes  And she's got quite an ass  Oh yeah, she does  And you go, hey  Are you Taylor?  And she'll go, what?  You could say  Are you the birthday girl?  Are you the birthday girl?  Alright  You should write that down  Just in case you forget  Just say Sam Wonser  I mean, not like that  Well  Don't speak for me, Nicole  Just say Sam Wonser  Just let it be  So you've seen 
[03:36:00]  Opie and Anthony  Go to the bathroom  With Club Soda Kenny  Because what happened today was  Anthony, I don't know how  He came to this realization  That it's humiliating  Well it is  They should be embarrassed  To be walking around  With a bodyguard  Escorting them to the bathroom  But they asked for it  Did they not?  They were the ones  Who put that rule into place  That they needed to be escorted  Right?  Well we were trying to figure out  Exactly how it happened  And then we remembered  That Opie got into  A big fight with Artie  Right, I remember  I don't care  You still should be man enough  To walk to the bathroom  By yourself  Like if there's a fight 
[03:36:30]  That breaks out  That's fine  So you got in a fight  With somebody  Like you need somebody  To hold your hand  I feel like they're like  Daddy, need to go to the potty  That's what happens?  No, but that's what I  That's what I think of  When I see them  Walking down the hall  With Kenny  Does the whole mashup  Laugh at them  When that happens?  And I'm sure  That they laugh at us  About other things  But when we see them  Walking down with Kenny  It's like  Opie  He says  His theory on this  Is that you're not  Making fun of  Them going to the bathroom  Like that  Because they deserve it  It's because you're jealous  That they're just  So famous 
[03:37:00]  They're so important  So famous  Yeah  And just a huge show  Is that what it is?  Just go to the bathroom  By yourself  Nobody's gonna  No one's gonna notice you  Or recognize you  And ask for your autograph  On the way down  To the bathroom  In the hall  It's not gonna happen  Oh sorry  Who's on the hotline?  Click the button  Who is it?  Do you know who it is Eric?  It's Anthony  Oh good  I don't know  Is he gonna fight with me now?  No I think Anthony  Anthony was worried about this  I'm not gonna fight with you  But here's the deal  I never asked for anyone 
[03:37:30]  To walk me to the bathroom  Maybe Opie did  Ever ever  Look I don't know  What happened between Kenny  And Opie  And Artie  And everything  All of a sudden  Like stupid Sam just said  I had a realization  An epiphany  I'm like  Why the fuck  Am I a grown man  Being walked to the bathroom  By another grown man?  Right  And it hit me  I'm like  Why  How did this happen  First of all  Why is it going on?  And then I started thinking  Oh my god  Everyone in the building 
[03:38:00]  Knows  Yeah we do  And makes fun of the fact  Totally  We're being escorted  And watched  Down the hallway  Like what's gonna happen?  Did you realize it  When he asked if you needed him  To hold it for you?  Oh my god  I'm sorry  I had to ask  Oh my god  You know I love you  But I mean you're a big boy  You can do it all for yourself  I know  Well I put an end to it today  Good thank you  I put an end to it  But then what puzzled me  Is how I'm gonna get this stigma  Off of me 
[03:38:30]  For having you know  People haven't seen it  And think I was asking for  A man to show me the way  To the bathroom  Yeah  It's embarrassing  It's very embarrassing  It's almost as embarrassing  Now what we're watching  Out of our studio  Yeah  Is our intern  Literally just running around  In circles  He's got nobody  Coming to the studio  Nobody  He's just running  He did not sound very confident  That he could find people  No  No  And they're easy to find  Literally  Everybody that works here  Was talking about this idea  Of Opie and Anthony 
[03:39:00]  Having to be escorted  By personal security  To the restroom  Alright  Goodbye  Oh his phone's breaking out  Okay I thought he just hung up on us  Are you there?  Call back if you can hear me  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Oh you're starting to come through  A little clearer  I'm in the Midtown Tunnel  It's almost out though  Oh  Almost out of the tunnel  Let's see if we can make it through  Let's see if we can make it through  Make it through with us  I'm almost out of the tunnel  Hold on 
[03:39:30]  Don't go anywhere  No we won't  We won't  We love you and we're not leaving  Okay  Can you hear me though?  Is it good?  We totally can  Now do you have security with you  To get through the tunnel?  No  I can take care of myself  Trust me  Sounds like Ant is not for it  But Opie likes to be walking to the bathroom  Is that your vibe, Ant?  I have no idea what it is between Kenny and Opie  What arrangements they have made in the past  Or anything  But I know me  And I know that I finally got so embarrassed  Thinking that this has been going on 
[03:40:00]  And I have no idea why  I would always look and be like  Why the fuck are you throwing me to the bathroom?  But I never said anything about it  Until I thought how embarrassing it is  And then  You know  Kenny wasn't here today  His replacement was  Did he welcome them?  Yeah  And Ant had to  By the second break  Just put his foot down  And say it's never happening again  Yeah  But  Back off bud  But who knows  If this is going to actually  Take into effect  Because Kenny's back on Monday  He doesn't like change  Does Kenny know?  I don't care  Kenny's not walking me 
[03:40:30]  To the fucking bathroom anymore  I can't wait  It's over  I can't wait  It's fucking over man  And again  The outcube guys  Were walking past the station earlier  So I had the door held open  And I was yelling  I was saying  I'm not being walked to the bathroom anymore  And they started laughing  And then I heard  When they got into their studio  Somebody was listening  And said  They said  Oh they must have heard us talking  So you know  Every show  And the outcube guys  Don't even have  The pristine look  To the bathroom  They just know 
[03:41:00]  Because everybody knows  It's happening  Yeah  It's the scuttlebutt  Of the fucking company  Yeah we've been talking  We've been talking shit  For some time now  But I'm proud of you  For taking a stand Ant  I just  I'm ashamed  That it went this long  I don't know why it did  I  It wasn't out of  Like I  I hated it  Always  But I don't know why  I didn't ever mention  I just kind of blew it off  Like whatever  Yeah like  Was it creepy  Did you like  Kept like turning around  Like why is someone  Following me  Yes it's like  As a matter of fact  I thought for some time  That he just happened 
[03:41:30]  To coincidentally  He'd be walking  That way also  For like a year  It's just wow  Yeah for a year  You're on similar schedules  Hell of a coincidence  But yeah  Yeah  Alright you two  Hash it out  Get some more people in there  And spread the word  Sam that it's over Johnny  It ain't happening no more  That's my goal  I need  Thank you very much Ant  I'm a big kid now  Alright bye  Talk to you later  That's the goal  Is to get as many people in here  Not only sharing their experiences  But letting them know 
[03:42:00]  That those days are done  Yeah  Eric what happened to the  We lost Alan  Alan got lost  Does he remember  Why he's running around  You want me to go get today  Yeah maybe you should  You should stay here  I'll go  Okay  Yeah even though  He writes stuff down  He never remembers  And gets it wrong  All the time  He might be getting it wrong  Right now  Yeah  Ope texted  Okay  He said  I never asked to be  Walked to the bathroom  The company knows  I'm unpredictable  It was their doing  Oh  So this is Opie being edgy 
[03:42:30]  This is like  Opie was a little crazy  And so the company was like  You know what  This guy can't get to the bathroom  Without it being an issue  I'm not going to do  What everybody thinks  I'm going to do  And freak out  By the way  We have some people  From 37  That came down  To want to talk about  The opium anthem  Bring them in here  What the fuck  Where are these interns  Yeah at least  They came out on their own  Yeah  This is not Alan's doing  Oh my buddy  This is Dave  Hey Dave  Dave  You're a tech guy  You do all like  You work with profit  Making sure 
[03:43:00]  All the shows are programmed  In the computers  And stuff like that  Is that right  Yeah operations  Operations  Make things go around  Yeah  Very important  Because most of the programming here  Is not live  It's recorded  Yeah  And Dave is a guy  Who makes sure  That the shit that you want to hear  Is the shit that's being heard  Right  Correct  Correct  So you're a floor away  You're up on 37  I'm on 37  I come down here once in a while  To kind of you know  Talk to people  And stretch my legs  And you know  That Opie and Anthony  Get escorted to the bathroom  Well it's funny  You see Club Soda Kenny 
[03:43:30]  Stand outside the bathroom  And he's on his little texting  And I'm like  What's he doing here  And then you see like  Opie or Anthony come out  And they walk back  They walk really slow  Very slow  That's the fun thing  You know I remember one time  There was a huge bodyguard  In front of a woman's bathroom  And these two girls run in  And I said  Well who's in there  And he was like  He's like  They're not going to bother her  Are they  I said well  I don't think so  They're probably going to  Gawk at it  All of a sudden  Kim Kardashian comes out  Now I can understand  A bodyguard for that  But for a dude  And you know  So you're saying  It's like Opie and Anthony  Were getting treated 
[03:44:00]  With the same level  Of Kim Kardashian security  In the fact that there's  Bodyguards outside the bathroom  Making sure  Like Kenny was sitting there  Practically putting a red rope  In front of the men's room  Yes always  Like I don't understand  Do they hate it here  Or do they really feel like  There might be a problem  We're trying to get to the bottom  Of exactly how it happened  So far  All we know is that  Opie feels the company  Views him as completely  Unpredictable  So there needs to be security  Wait but I mean  Like if they were out  Somewhere else  Like if they were at an event 
[03:44:30]  I could understand  Kenny walking into the bathroom  Like at a club  But they're at their place of work  A lot of people  They're at their  They should be in their  Comfort zone  There's literally  Same place  Nine people at that hour  That they share the bathroom with  And they know all of them  It'd be funny if like  Kenny actually went in the bathroom  And kind of just  You know  Leaned over and watched  Just watch  So do you guys talk about  This stuff upstairs  Like is this been  I think we've mentioned it  You know  The funny thing is like  You know  Someone said  Who's that large man  With the little tiny head  In a suit  I'm like that's club soda Kenny 
[03:45:00]  I mean Dice's guy  Or like well  Yeah used to be  Yeah  So they know him  People know of Kenny  Mainly as  Opie and Anthony's  Bathroom protector  Bodyguards  Security  Head of security  Do you guys kind of laugh  Like who do these guys  Think they are  They need to be escorted  To the bathroom  I just thought it was  A little weird  Yeah  You know  It's a lot weird  Like would you want to  Like just run to the bathroom  And you know wave  Alright hey  Yeah and then get back  What's actually going to happen  You know you got Nadine  At the front there  He's very unpredictable  We found out today  That Nadine has also 
[03:45:30]  Made comments  About the fact that  Are you joking  That's what Roland said  What are those two men  Doing in there  Yeah our receptionist  Nadine  I want you to know  Mitch  Oh here comes Mitch  Mitch Todd everybody  Is the boss of production  Yeah the big boss  That's right  The big boss  And you've voiced a lot  Of stuff for us  As a matter of fact  I hope you get Anthony  And didn't he  Didn't he do the intro  For Black History  Yes  Yes  Fabulous  You got all kinds of voices  That you do  That's right  But you've also  On top of a voice  You've got eyes  And you see what goes on  Around here 
[03:46:00]  I've got eyeballs  That's right  Two of them  And you live in Westchester  And I live in Westchester  So it's a  It's a parallel lives  But I'm in the poor section  Well I do live in a rich area  Of Westchester  Right  But right there on the fringe  Right there on the border  So you know  You're right on the railroad track  Yeah yeah  I got you  Now tell me Mitch  Yeah  Have you heard about  Opie and Anthony  Being escorted to the bathroom  By Club Soda Kenny  Oh absolutely  Every time they go  Oh no  You know about this  I'm well aware  So embarrassing  That everybody knows 
[03:46:30]  And you guys  What's the problem with that  Well is it  Have you talked about it with people  Have people talked about it to you  No but I'll tell you my thoughts on it  Please do  Please do  I think I've been at this company  For going on 13 years  Wow  I've seen a lot of things  In that bathroom  You have  I think it's very prudent  That they not only have  Perhaps one but even two  Security guards with them  Holding an elbow  On each side  Of the urinal  You think that's necessary  I mean I think we could go on  For hours on what I've seen  In that restroom before  So that way they literally  Not only would they 
[03:47:00]  Not have to touch anything  Right  But even the bottom of their feet  Wouldn't have to come into contact  With the floor  Right  Right  Ideally  It's a very dangerous place  Terribly dangerous  Wow  Look at that  I mean I  Just a few weeks ago  I saw Gene Simmons  In full costume  Rip a partition off  From one of the urinals  And toss it across the  Into the bathroom  Now let me ask you  What's more dangerous than that  Gene Simmons  Yes  Legendary rock star  Legendary  He's in full regalia  Full  Did he have somebody  Escort him to the bathroom  He can take care of himself 
[03:47:30]  Okay okay  Oh well he can  Gene Simmons can take care of himself  The cat escorted him  Right  Yeah yeah  Peter Chris was there  I got your back Gene  Don't worry about it  In fact I'm an anti-gun guy too  You know there's a lot of buzz about guns  Perhaps they should carry their own weapons in there as well  Yeah  Just  You know  A couple AKs  I don't know  Even as an anti-gun guy  You're saying it may be that dangerous  Highly  Well I want Mitch  Dave  I want you guys to make sure you're spreading this around to everyone  I'm spreading everything  You know what you should do  You should put a bucket in here  And then about  In three weeks 
[03:48:00]  They'll build you a bathroom  Oh I see  So if there's just a bucket next to the chair  They're good to go  They'll be here to knock out the wall  We've got to build a bathroom for O&A  Well you know they say  They keep shitting in a bucket  Yeah  They make bedpans  They're cheap  I need you guys  I need you guys to know  Obi and Anthony have foreboden  Club Soda Kenny or any security from following to the bathroom  From this day forward  They will not be escorted by security to the bathroom  Well good luck guys  Okay  Liam come on in 
[03:48:30]  Let's make room for Liam now  Liam can take my seat  Mark Zito is here  Mark Zito come in  We just want to watch  Ryan is here from the morning mashup  Taylor's doing an interview  As soon as she's done she'll come in  Was there an incident at one point  That like made it necessary for them to be followed  Well I don't know necessary  Opie got into an argument with Artie Lang once  Oh  But I mean  Just on a gauge of how long ago that was  Artie Lang was here  Yeah  It was a long time ago  It was a while back  Liam 
[03:49:00]  Yeah  Talent Booker to the stars  Right  You've seen a lot of people come in here  Yeah  What percentage of celebrities that walk in here  Are escorted by security to the bathroom  Uh maybe 1%  Like 1%  Okay  That's so little  And we have major celebrities  Huge  Come in here  I mean  There's  Everybody uses that bathroom  Right  Almost everybody  You know what  One time Jess  Urinated at the stall next to Katy Perry  Without an issue  Without an issue  She didn't have anyone in there  Or standing outside  Certainly not 
[03:49:30]  No no no  I mean  Katy Perry  Jess was surprised  Cause she goes  Sam  I'm just up here for a second  And I pissed next to Katy Perry  Who knew  I just looked down  And I saw little strawberries on her shoes  Or whatever she was wearing that day  I remember Dave Grohl  Was peeing in the bathroom  And people were going up to him  And asking him for autographs  He's like  Well I'm peeing  My dick's in my hand right now  But like  Sure afterwards  We can do that  Nobody with him  I think  John Fogerty's the only one  Who had like  An escort into the bathroom  We had to clear the bathroom  Well John Fogerty  Is a guy  Who got sued by himself  So you know 
[03:50:00]  He's somebody  You have to  Yeah yeah yeah  But do you know  So that's the discussion here  Do you know  That Opie and Anthony  For the last several years  Have had  Oh I've noticed it  Yeah  It's really weird  Everybody knows  It's really weird  Have people talked about it  Kind of  I mean  People just wondered why  Like what the reason is  Because O and A  In the hallways  Are very  They keep to themselves  Really  And Jimmy too  Unless he wants a photo  They just  They don't do anything  That was a  Mark Zito laugh  In the background  Zito should not be laughing right now 
[03:50:30]  What  Fuck you  What would you  Does he get a lot of photos Zito  No no no  We got a little thing  What thing  What's the thing  Zito and I have a little problem right now  What's the problem  Well I have a performance this afternoon  In our main performance space  And Zito broke it  He broke the performance  Yeah  Why would you break a studio  It was an accident  It was a complete accident  Yeah but I mean  He did break it  He's the one who did it  If you can't handle being in there  Right  Don't be in there  With bottles of water  Bottles of water Zito  It's electronics  Oh God 
[03:51:00]  Somebody left it  It is  Wow  What did you say  Come on  An east side Dave move  Now Liam  Tell me this  Yeah  Who do you talk  Who talks about the bathroom with you  Well the receptionist has asked me a few times  Because she sees it  And she's not  She's just like  Why are they going into there  With the  Right  The Jamaican accent  And the receptionist is a lovely Jamaican woman  Who literally sees everything  Yeah  Yeah but  Do you guys  Have you discussed why this happens  Like what's the reason  Well  I mean again  The only thing anybody can come to a conclusion on 
[03:51:30]  Yeah  Was that it dates back to the Artie Lang situation  And  Is that a fight member  Yeah  Opie and Anthony went on record today  It wasn't happening before then  I don't know  I remember it from day one  You do Ryan  Yeah like day one when you guys walked in  He  Kenny would never go like maybe all the way to the bathroom  But halfway and watch the bathroom door  He would do it over at 57th street was it  He would do that too because there was an audience there  And he didn't want anybody to accost the host  The audience I understand  There's no audience here  There's never an audience here  In fact that's been a point of contention 
[03:52:00]  For Opie and Anthony  That they don't have their audience anymore  Right  No blue shoes  I mean you're at home  You're just not here  Yeah that's fair  But  Anthony  I was telling Nicole  Who by the way  Nicole  Bob Kelly just texted me  And said I love this girl  I love you too Bob Kelly  Justin Stangle  Just texted me from David Letterman's show  And he said  I have to make boom boom  If someone is available to take me  Wow  I like that  He's also listening  He has to make boom boom  But  Liam  It's really weird 
[03:52:30]  Anthony came to this  Realization  That is my  They spent all their time  Making fun of people right  Yeah  They've made fun of everybody around here  Right  Anthony just today realized  Everybody around here  Is making fun of them  For having security  Walk them to the bathroom  It happens  Doesn't it  We talk about it  Well then Liam  I need you to know  Okay  They are not  Going to have security  Wow  With them in the bathroom  This is crazy  Yeah  Anthony made that claim  Opie then  When he was asked  Why do we have them following us 
[03:53:00]  Opie goes  Yeah I don't know either  I think Kenny just does it  He later  Opie later texted  E-Rock  And claimed it was because  He was so unpredictable  Yeah  The company insisted  That there be security  With him  Interesting  Maybe Kenny just does it  I don't know  He was out today  Yeah you haven't talked to him about it  No  Because I think that that's  You get to the source there  You got to  I mean if you're going to be  A hard hitting reporter  Get the information  Talk to Kenny  And I want to know too  How is he going to react to this  You know Kenny  Kenny's going to be upset  He doesn't like change  He's going to be embarrassed too  And I think  I think he's going to be mad 
[03:53:30]  At the Kenny substitute  Who was in here today  Because he's going to be like  What did you screw up  That this came up  While you were on duty  Good call  Yeah he's totally going to do that  I don't know what's going to happen  He's going to get upset  But Liam  Okay  Is that more of the  Marginal Liam conflict  That's going on  I have a band coming up here  What band?  Half an hour  That's a jam band  But it's like  Fish?  No it's not Fish  But it's like  I don't have to cancel this thing  If it was Fish  It'd be a big  Is it Danny Tamburelli's band?  It's not Danny Tamburelli's band  Okay  Because you know  I got Danny Tamburelli's back  That's cool 
[03:54:00]  That's my boy  That's fine  Alright  You know what you should do  Is find some poor actor  Like the minute  Kenny stops following to the bathroom  Hire some poor actor  To accost one of them  In the bathroom  Just they need it again  Did you say poor actor  Because I said Danny Tamburelli  And that came to your mind  Because that's not cool  It might have been subliminal  By the way  Did anybody else notice  That Mitch Todd  Was doing a production guy voice  While he was in here live  I didn't hear it  He totally put on  Like a voice  That's cool  I enjoyed it  I don't think he goes  On the air much  No he was doing character  He's excited  Mitch Todd on the air guy  So can we get like  Zito to accost him? 
[03:54:30]  I don't want to do that  I've already done that  In real life apparently  Well here's what would happen  If Zito kind of  Jumped out of a stall  We should encourage him  To do that  Because Ant would surely  Put a bullet in his head  So hopefully  I don't think you really  Want that  Hopefully  No you're right Zito  That would be sad  I would hate that  Right  Well I wouldn't hate it  Because it would be a funny story  But  It would be a really good story  I would feel bad for your family  We could Instagram it  Feel good for my friends here  You would Instagram me  With a bullet in my head  No just Anthony  Right  And Anthony would like  Be blowing off the smoking gun  Exactly  Be like look what Anthony 
[03:55:00]  Just did  Hilarious  I think he'll get a lot of  Follows  I think he'll get a bad day  Aww Zito  See I like when the  Mashups in the studio  Because I get a reaction  That you would never  Otherwise get  That's true  There's a human condition  Happening  Let's look at this  I think that's just Nicole  I think Ryan's gonna laugh  As if  Yeah  Pretty much  And you can't go on  To the mashup  And talk about what's going on  Because you could talk  For 30 seconds  And then they gotta  Get back to the hits  Gotta get back to the hits  You know they don't talk  What about when you get  To tell them good news  Tell us something good  That's what we wanna hear 
[03:55:30]  Tuesday  You sing the song for us  Right  Tell us something good  That's bad  That's so bad  So amazing  I can't believe you do that  On the radio  Can you sing  What's in Stan's sex  No I'm not singing that song  You shouldn't  He stands on here  I don't know  That is the best one  Yeah it is the best one  Alright you guys gotta leave  I've told you  I've told you  When I came here  To tell you  But we're not gonna be here  Advocating for the morning mashup  To sing  You know that's not  What this is about  Thank you Sam  Hop back over  They're still live  Oh yeah  Oh yeah that's right  Don't even worry about it  You guys gotta get back  Down the hall  Don't you 
[03:56:00]  Yeah because the  Opie and Anthony audience  Is really also  Mashup crossover  Right  Does happen  Alright cool  Alright thank you very much  And spread the word  Let people know  That Kenny will not be  Following them to the  Toilet anymore  Eric who do we have here  This is Pete  He does sports production  Hang on  Hang on  I'm not too tall  Was it very simple  Can you hear it  Yeah I was just  Pushing all the buttons  Why would you do that  I didn't know what to push  I got nervous  Why'd you get nervous honey  I wasn't really nervous  I was trying to push  All the buttons  Okay  Scared me  Pete  This is Pete in sports production  Sports production 
[03:56:30]  What's going on guys  You're also aware of  What's been going on  You work at the production studio  Right next to  The Opie and Anthony studio  So I come in  I have to pass the men's room  When I come in through  The building through reception  And walk down the hall  And what do you see  Well you guys have been here  What three or four years now  I'd say so yeah  So when I first came  I've been fans of ONA  Going back to the N.E.W. days  Whatever so I knew who they were  But would see the guy  And you're thinking to yourself  Can't wait to see those guys  In the bathroom  So I can finally accost them  Well it was very intimidating  The first time I went in  Because Kenny is standing 
[03:57:00]  Way like you said  He never quite comes  More than half way down the hall  So I went in  And Opie was in the bathroom  And I was like  Oh maybe he's security  Maybe something's going on  Let me just not  I won't make eye contact  He doesn't  He'll never go all the way  To the bathroom  But he'll always make  His presence known  Yes  Yes 100%  There's no mistaking  What his job is  By staring at you  He stares at you creepily  Well you know what he's doing  When he's staring at you  I don't know  That's fodder for later  Oh okay  Does he also sometimes  Carry Ant's bag out  Have I seen 
[03:57:30]  No  Anthony if you're still listening  That may be something  You want to address  But he may at times  Carry Anthony's bag for him  I just thought he was under  A personal services contract  With the guys  That's you know  But that's fine  Now Ant if he's still listening  If he's not out of his car  Realizes that maybe  Not only are people mentioning  That Opie and Anthony  Get an escort to the bathroom  They have a bag boy  Yeah but does that make them  Look famous and cool  Because they've got like  An assistant  He's not just their  Nicole you see them  Are you like  Those are cool guys 
[03:58:00]  Or are you making fun of them  With your friends  I mean I love them  I don't know if I say  That they're cool guys  But I'm not really that cool  The mashups making fun of them  For that yes  And that's the point  Yeah  That they're walking down the hall  And every show is making fun of them  While the mics are off  Yeah  That's what makes our show  A little different  Yeah  Sorry guys  Love you though  We got Anthony back  Oh knew it  This is good  Is this the right mouse  Kenny never carries my bag out  Anthony's  Fucking way  Did you hear that Pete  He's saying no way 
[03:58:30]  I must have been seeing things  I'm sorry  Has Kenny ever carried your bag for you  Sometimes in the morning  If I had to get something  Or pick something up  But never  No I carry my own shit  But you see what happens  I carry my own shit  I don't need a fucking guy  To walk me to the bathroom  I carry my own shit  I take care of myself  I don't know why this went on so long  You see what happens  Something that was there  And I never really thought about it much  I thought it was weird  But I never really gave it much thought  Until today  I'm just like 
[03:59:00]  Why the fuck am I being followed to the bathroom  And now you see what happens  Is people see you  With a bathroom escort  For three or four years  And they're just going to assume things  Like oh yeah  He holds his bags  He blows his nose for him  He calls him when he needs to be wiped  Right  Oh  Alright  So that's also on the record  That Kenny does not hold your bag for you  No he doesn't hold my bag  Okay  Wow  Bye  Bye  Love you Ant  Oh he's so upset  He seems all hot and bothered  His panties are all a bunch over this  Well I mean  He realized today 
[03:59:30]  He might have been looked at as less than a man  By some people  Right  But I want you to know Pete  They've set the gauntlet down  There will be no more escorts to the bathroom  Okay  Okay  And spread that around  Because they want everybody to know  You got it  And I'm not in the habit of making  Awkward urinal conversation anyway  So I wouldn't bother the guys  Don't accost them  If I was there  If they were there without Kenny  I wouldn't bother them  Don't give them  Don't prove them wrong  No  Pete  Okay  I'm going to be watching you  If Kenny's not  Thank you very much  Spread that around  Bye Pete  Now  Nicole

I'm sorry I have to go  Interview Luke Wilson  I'm always stoked  When I get to sit next to  Nicole but she always  Makes an excuse  And it's always the same guy  She's interviewing  You're a creep  I know  You're a creep  No he's not  I'm way less of one  With a wife and a kid though  Yeah but then it's also like  Really?  He's a father?  It's one of those  What anybody can get into this?  Yeah and you're like  Yeah I just stuck it in  And left it  Exactly  Nicole if you see Taylor 
[04:03:30]  Send her in here  I will  You've seen Opie and Anthony  Go to the bathroom  Before here right?  I have  You notice they are escorted  When they go?  By a large man  You have noticed  Yeah  You have noticed  Is it something people talk about?  Have people at the Ellis show  Talked about it?  No  No  I guess Jason Ellis is in California  So maybe he hasn't seen it  Hopefully  Yeah no  And every time Ellis is in the hallways  It doesn't matter  What kind of escort  Is with other people  People just steer clear of Ellis 
[04:04:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah  He's got a presence  But wait  And Kenny doesn't  It's true  Listen  Can I tell you my story about Kenny?  Yes you can  E-Rock  Ellis was here  For those who don't know E-Rock  He's the fatter  Chubbier producer  I'm right here  Oh I'm sorry  I didn't know  If I had to give you a proper introduction  Ellis was here  And you guys  Had him on the show  Right  We're getting ready to go on  Opie has always been fucking cool  In coming out  Before everything goes down  And being like  How's everything going 
[04:04:30]  Sure  And Opie said to me  Hey you know  You can come in and sit on the couch  And I believe it was Ellis' first appearance  And I just didn't want to be that guy  Sitting off in the corner  That directed attention away from Ellis  So I was like  You didn't want to be what you naturally are  The creep  I said  Hey it's cool  I'll stay outside  And I listened outside  And afterwards  Everybody  The show was over  Everybody's hanging out  Shaking hands  And E-Rock taps on my shoulder  And is like  Come on in the room  Now Opie had told me  It was cool to come in the room  E-Rock told me 
[04:05:00]  It was cool to come in the room  E-Rock stepped in  And Kenny  Came across the doorway  Like a big brick wall  There you go  And I said  E-Rock just  And he  Dude  He  Backed me down  Like it was scary  I thought the guy  Was going to fucking hit me  And I said  Look dude  I don't have to go in  The guy just told me to come in  There's been  You know what  Kenny does his job  Things were not communicated to him  Things were not communicated  And he made sure  Shit happened the way  It was supposed to happen  I let Kenny know 
[04:05:30]  You knew  I made sure Kenny saw Opie say  Hey come on in  You understood  I understood  Kenny takes his job very seriously  So because of this incident  Right  When I have seen them  On the way to the bathroom  I steer clear man  I don't know what the bathroom etiquette is  It hasn't been gone over with me  Do people around here  Talk about the fact that  Opie and Anthony  Are the only  Radio show hosts here  Who  Have an escort to the bathroom  To use the restroom  Yeah well I mean  You can obviously compare it  To the Howard thing 
[04:06:00]  I've seen  I've seen Ronnie walk  A couple of the Howard guys out  He does  Back with  When Artie was here  I believe that used to happen  It's not a good look  Yeah  They want everybody to know  This is very important  That this is not  Going to happen anymore  They came to a realization today  That it's something  That everybody was making fun  Of them for  They manned up  Yeah  They manned up in a big way  Because I had talked to  All the other shows  And I'm talking to production guys  Mitch Todd was in here today  Dave who does all the  You know the computer stuff 
[04:06:30]  You're in here  Nicole's in here  Ryan's in here  Everybody  Is aware of this  The guys who host OutQ  Were talking about  Opie and Anthony  Behind their back  It's humiliating  Yeah  It's a bad look  And so  Anthony realized  That there was absolutely  No reason for Kenny  To be following them  To the bathroom  He brought this up  Once Anthony said something  Opie goes  You know what  You're right  That's ridiculous  We would make fun of  Somebody for doing that  And we're getting  Made fun of  And so I need you 
[04:07:00]  To spread out  To everybody  And let  Make sure  You know  Your voice  Reaches a lot of people  It does  Make sure people are aware  That they do not need  A bathroom escort  And they will not have  One in the future  Okay Cullen  I think it's a big day  Of growing today  Good  Good  And I want everybody  To know that  Let me go to Mike  In Ohio  Mike  Mike  Hey how are ya  I'm great  Like Cullen said  Today's a growing day  So we're all feeling  Pretty good  We all know that  Opie and Anthony  Are finally comfortable enough  To go to the bathroom
