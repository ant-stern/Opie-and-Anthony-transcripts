<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of their successful New York City radio ratings and the relaunch of their controversial "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" segment.  They jokingly blamed their high ratings (second only to a Spanish-language station) on equally offensive content.  The New Hampshire primary results dominated a significant portion, with commentary on Hillary Clinton's perceived shift in demeanor.  Initially endorsing the relatively unknown Republican candidate Duncan Hunter based on an online quiz, the hosts subsequently heavily criticized his staunchly pro-life and socially conservative positions, reading extensively from his platform. This segment also included humorous banter about a misinterpretation of a comment from their co-worker, E-Rock, leading to a running joke about the fictional candidate "Jimmy Tide."  The show also promoted their iTunes animated shorts, "Italian Storm Chasers" and "The Return of Tippi Tom,"  and featured listener feedback, including a threatening message from a listener angered by their political commentary.  The "story of the day" involved a bizarre attempt to cash a deceased man's social security check in New York City.

The show continued with Jim Norton joining the hosts to reminisce about their first alcoholic experiences, followed by the "FU Line," a segment featuring highly profane angry voicemails from listeners. Jim Norton then discussed his upcoming comedy tour. A caller, Jeremy, challenged the notion of systemic oppression hindering Black success, referencing Barack Obama's presidency.  A listener provided a fact about the Boston Molasses Disaster, prompting darkly humorous speculation about its potential as a weapon.  Discussion of Steven S.'s blog, Bayshore's Fine Rundown, highlighted censorship of a segment referring to Iranian boat operators as "filthy savages," changed to "filthy dinghies" for television.  Another caller, Tony, inquired about a presidential poll website, leading to a discussion about a company blocking access to the Opie and Anthony show.  The show again promoted their content featuring Tippi Tom, a homeless man they knew, including an animation and a "Books on Tape" segment.  Listener criticism of Opie for not letting Tippi Tom stay at his house led to a discussion about the complexities and dangers of helping homeless individuals, illustrated by a news story of a homeless man murdering his benefactor.

Further segments included discussions of Jessica Simpson missing a Cowboys game, the Baseball Hall of Fame inductions (specifically Mark McGwire's exclusion), and a murdered hiker in Georgia, which sparked a lengthy debate on the death penalty. A children's song about rocks was used for a "bleep game," and the show featured a review of the video "Goddess Bunny," followed by more commentary on the New Hampshire primary, focusing on John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, with particular emphasis on Hillary Clinton’s perceived phoniness and a political strategist hired by her campaign.

The show also tackled a caller's comment about the lack of diverse representation in movies depicting a Black president, further discussion about the presidential election being likened to a reality TV show, and the potential impact of a Black or female president.  Anthony shared encountering hateful online comments hoping for a race war. The conversation continued with more criticism of Hillary Clinton's perceived phoniness and a comparison to her husband.  Another "bleep game" featured staff members Danny and Sam creatively censoring a news story about a child gluing his hand to his bed to avoid school.  Listener calls covered topics like the perceived insincerity of politicians, Robert Moses' impact on New York City, the hypocrisy surrounding video game violence, and the political implications of Barack Obama's religious background.  The segment concluded with a live review of *Dragon's Lair* by the Angry Video Game Nerd.  The hosts mentioned good ratings the previous day and noted Brother Weez's absence due to negotiations.

A phone interview with James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, followed, focusing on his YouTube reviews of notoriously bad video games, including discussions of poorly made pornographic games on early consoles. Comedian Ralphie May then joined the studio, discussing his experiences with his colicky baby and the show continued with the recurring comedic bit, "The Mad Scientist and Epstein," with two episodes played. A discussion about Steve, one of the bit’s creators, ensued following an email Steve sent about shaving his beard in a gas station bathroom. The segment ended with a humorous comparison of Barack Obama's speech patterns to The Rock's and a brief discussion of local legend Jack Rhodes, known for knocking hats off people’s heads.

The show opened its final segment with a discussion about a news story involving 45-year-old drug addict Jack Rhodes punching a 101-year-old woman.  Promotional announcements for Ralphie May’s comedy shows and Anthony’s appearance at the South Beach Comedy Festival followed.  The “Line of the Day” segment, sponsored by BodogFantasy.net, was announced and a listener’s $6 win was highlighted.  The conversation returned to the fictional candidate "Jimmy Tide" and a proposed "hat party" for listeners, leading to a lengthy and rambling discussion about different types of hats, eventually shifting to a critical discussion of the *Flintstones* cartoon, interspersed with crude jokes and offensive language. The segment concluded with the announcement and reading of the "Line of the Day" winner and runner-ups, along with more banter and jokes, and a final remark about interacting with other dimensions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Yes, man.  It's doing it now.  His skin is completely black.  Oh my God.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  Roll his dick in Dave's ass.  Who saw this coming?  They are sick.  Freaks.  One, two, three.  Go.  B-Rock is a 10-0.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, what the hell day is it? 
[00:01:30]  What?  What the hell day is it?  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Okay.  That makes sense.  We're going to relaunch WOW in the spring.  Relaunch it.  Yeah, we kind of, you know, we kind of, it's there.  But we don't really, really pounce on it.  Because, you know, it's winter. 
[00:02:00]  Although you wouldn't know it here, the Big Apple.  Boy, do we have record-breaking temperature yet?  It was kind of nice, though.  Well, I was watching the news last night, and all these dopey news anchors,  they're thanking the weather guy for such great weather.  Oh, Todd, I just want to thank you for the great weather you gave us today.  What great weather.  I hope you have another good day coming up for us.  Well, we're going to give it a try.  Right.  What, with your weather machine, dopey?  And then they had to say it's going to be nice for another day or two. 
[00:02:30]  On the East Coast, of course, Boston, New York.  Yeah.  Even Buffalo is feeling a little warmth lately.  A balmy 20?  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Oh, can you tell I'm still sick?  Nice.  Nothing but yellow loogies.  Anyway.  With a hint of green.  Sorry, Jim.  So then they're talking to weather the guys, and they're like, but some big changes on the 
[00:03:00]  way.  But don't kill the messenger.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's not me.  Oh, they suck.  Yeah.  They all just suck.  It was nice, though, going out and not having to bundle up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  I'm a summer guy.  But yeah, Whipin' Now Wednesday will be relaunched in the spring.  Big time.  Yeah.  Maybe brand new Wow stickers.  Maybe a brand new Wow logo.  Wow.  We all want to see more and more boobies. 
[00:03:30]  Boobies for everybody.  Bold on our part.  For the people out there, Whipin' Now Wednesday, you know the deal, I hope.  But every day, it's very interesting.  Every day, we're talking to very new listeners.  There are people listening right now that have no idea what Whipin' Now Wednesday is all  about.  Damn them to hell, I say.  We have Wow stickers, especially here in the New York City area.  You pretty much can't drive your car without seeing at least one Wow sticker every day.  That's how many Wow stickers we got in the New York area. 
[00:04:00]  And there's so many different versions of the Wow sticker in New York that most people  don't even know what radio station we're on anymore.  No.  I got to pull up real close and go, oh, yeah, that one's nice.  That's a good one.  They're like collectibles.  And you look and go, ooh, wow, there's an old NEW one.  Yeah.  I've seen the WNEW Wow stickers.  I've seen the Free FM Wow stickers.  I've seen XM Satellite Radio Wow stickers.  I've seen some KROQ Wow stickers.  And some from out of state, from other markets. 
[00:04:30]  Which confuses people.  Wait, I don't think that radio station is heard in my city.  So you got a lot of the Wow stickers.  Then you got a lot of the people that get really motivated and make really, really nice  Wow signs and put on their car and decals or what have you.  Those things are really cool, by the way.  People spend a lot of money on their Wow sticker or their Wow display.  And the truckers just scrape it in the dirt on the back of their truck. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And then there's a bunch of ladies that we like to call whores.  What?  No.  You know, they know I'm just messing with you.  They're wonderful.  They absolutely are wonderful.  But there are a bunch of ladies, more than a bunch I would say, that will absolutely give  you a little taste of what they're sporting.  Yep.  Just because you got a Wow sticker on your car.  Yeah.  It's an amazing, an amazing radio promotion that we started many, many years ago.  Always said it was like fishing.  You just put the line in the water, put your Wow in the vehicle, and then you just forget 
[00:05:30]  about it.  You wait.  The best part about it is you never know when it's going to happen.  Yep.  It might never happen.  Sorry.  To some people, it never has happened.  Which means you're really creepy.  Right.  You need to get a makeover.  You need to shower.  Yeah.  You need to maybe lose a few LBs.  The girl sees the Wow.  She pulls up next to the vehicle, all ready to go.  Oh, she's unleashed and ready to rock.  Oh, ready to rock.  She sees the Wow. 
[00:06:00]  She's like, I'm going to do this.  Right.  I'm going to do this and support the Opie and Anthony show, and wow, and this is fun.  It's freeing.  It's a great.  Oh, my God.  I'm not showing him anything.  He'll follow me home and kill me.  Yeah.  And you have no idea how close you are to seeing some lovely, lovely boobage.  Brust-siss-siss-siss-siss-siss.  So, Wow is happening every Wednesday, pretty much all the time.  We kind of change it into, you know, whip them out whenever.  One hour.  So, the ladies are out there, and they are looking for the Wow stickers and the Wow sign. 
[00:06:30]  So, we want to acknowledge it is whip them out Wednesday.  The other thing I want to acknowledge is that we did very well in the ratings here in New York City.  Thank you, New York.  One of our best showings in New York since we came back to regular radio.  And, not to get too technical, but the whole reason we're doing a radio show on regular radio is to do well with men 18 to 49.  Yep.  And we are number two. 
[00:07:00]  Nice.  In the New York area.  Behind a España station.  Yeah, behind.  España.  Behind the Spanish bastards.  Yeah.  Who I hear get away with murder, because it's, you know, a different language.  Yeah, no one knows what they're saying every morning.  But they know it's filthy.  No one knows to report them.  They know it's filthy.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't know how to report them.  You don't know how to report them, and the people that are listening to them don't care.  See, I took six years of Spanish growing up.  Yeah.  I've tuned in the channel.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  I have no clue.  No clue.  Because they're all the dirty words you never learned in school.  Right.  Well, because they teach you, like, you know, proper Spanish, if there is such a thing.  Not the dirty street Spanish.  Yeah.  That is actually being spoken.  You take your Spanish that you learned in high school, and you go out there, go into some of these neighborhoods, they'll openly laugh at you.  Yeah.  It's like speaking proper English.  Imagine walking around speaking proper English.  No.  Well, that's what the Spanish thing's all about. 
[00:08:00]  You've got to learn that dirty Spanish.  That dirty gutter Spanish.  Is Spanish you learn in school, like speaking, like Shakespeare wrote?  Yes, that's what I'm getting at.  Exactly.  It's like that.  Yes.  Well, that's silly.  You need to learn the Spanish slang.  You need how to get down and dirty with your Spanish.  That's what I wanted when I went to school and took Spanish.  Instead, I learned how to talk like a Spanish, Spanish intellect. 
[00:08:30]  A Spanish intellect.  I think the Spanish could still take a joke, right?  I hope so.  They haven't bitched and complained and caused a ruckus.  They're ahead of us.  Yeah.  The one station ahead of us, or the one show ahead of us, or whatever it is.  But, oh, thank you so much, New York.  Coming to the table.  Yeah.  For our show.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, we got a ways to go, but as far as the reason we do a radio show, I 
[00:09:00]  mean, we love the women that listen to our show.  Trust me.  Yep.  Trust me.  Makes it so much more fun to go out and do, like, public appearances and stuff, because  you actually have women in the room.  Yeah.  And that only started happening in the last couple of years.  We had to, like, do sausage party after sausage party after sausage party.  And get a couple strippers from the local strip club to kind of hotten up the room.  And we had to sit there with big smiles, like, yeah, we're excited to be in a room full of  guys. 
[00:09:30]  Yep.  But something changed the last couple of years, and we got more and more women.  They feel comfortable to hang out in the Opie and Anthony atmosphere.  But like Hope said, the goal here is the men demo, and it's like the tools section in  Home Depot.  What?  You know, you look around the tools section in Home Depot.  Yeah.  Their goal isn't to get a bunch of women in there to buy some Ryobi drills or something.  They don't mind a dumb broad going in and picking up.  Yeah, occasionally she goes in and picks something up. 
[00:10:00]  Pick up a power tool or something.  Of course.  Occasionally she's going in there and picking something up.  But for the most part, it's a bunch of guys in there.  For her pleasure.  The power drill for her pleasure.  Right.  Go ahead.  But for the most part, it's a bunch of guys going in there.  That's what they expect.  That's what they're gunning for, advertising for.  Right.  And that's what they get.  There you have it.  That's what we do.  That's what we do now.  All right.  And then a couple other things we want to promote.  iTunes, let's not forget.  We got a nice little deal with iTunes. 
[00:10:30]  In the podcast section, there's O&A Shorts.  They're animated features of some of our bits.  And the latest one is Italian Storm Chasers.  Yes.  It's hilarious, man.  I remember that one.  I watched that again last night.  I was laughing my ass off.  Yeah, it's a good one.  We had a tornado touchdown in Brooklyn, which is just ridiculous.  Proving that we're all doomed.  Unheard of.  That the environment is changing for the worse.  And we did a little bit on it with the local flavor.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Chasing the tornadoes.  And it's now animated up on iTunes.  And we promote that because we're very proud of that.  It's a huge, huge way to market the Opie and Anthony show.  And you don't have to buy anything.  It doesn't cost you anything.  It's a free download.  So if you've got the iTunes, go and check that out and download it to your device.  And spread it around if you think it's good enough to share among people that don't listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  And then on onaradio.com, The Return of Tippi Tom is now animated. 
[00:11:30]  And you can go there right now.  And one click, you can check out some animation of The Return of Tippi Tom, Our Homeless Friend.  Okay?  All right.  See that one.  I woke up and I came in and I wanted to go right at it with Anthony about Obama.  And then I look at the front pages of the paper and it says, who's crying now?  And Hillary, Hillary beat Obama.  Actually, I'm a little frightened.  They're calling it a stunning New Hampshire victory. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, but look at what she had to do in order to win.  Because I look at the cover of the New York Post and it's a picture of Hillary and it just says back from the dead.  She's apparently a zombie.  Yeah.  And that's the only way she won.  This primary.  And for some reason, I'm very frightened of zombies.  Yeah.  Back from the dead.  Would you really say she was that?  It was one primary she lost.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  And they were counting her out.  Right.  And all the pollsters and everybody were expecting Obama to run away with this one.  Right.  And Hillary got it.  I hate politics.  I really do.  And I don't really give a crap who the next president's going to be.  Oh, I do.  I'm pushing for Obama because it's driving Anthony crazy.  But President Hunter.  President Duncan Hunter.  Yeah, we'll get into Duncan Hunter in a second.  But the thing I wanted to say about Hillary, it just shows you how fickle people are. 
[00:13:00]  She shows a human side to her yesterday, right?  We played the audio of her kind of crying.  Not really.  She was on the verge.  But you heard.  Yeah, she's got a little misty, they called her.  You heard a bit of emotion in her voice.  Not that dumb robot voice that we've been making fun of for years.  And I think her people are listening to our show.  Her peeps.  Oh, Carl is crazy.  That's okay.  But we're noticing that she's changing her whole cadence.  She changed her voice completely.  She's going for the new, more accessible, just more, I guess, emotional. 
[00:13:30]  She's trying to get a personality.  Because for years, all she did was that robot speak.  We goof on it all the time.  The crowd starts getting behind her.  And she did this thing where she talked about how she's going to change the country for the better. 
[00:14:00]  And it wasn't connecting with the people.  It came off as insincere, phony, completely phony.  I got an example of that really fast enough.  Oh, yeah, please.  Like we're kidding.  It's pretty accurate to Anthony's impression.  They've been coming after me for 16 years.  And much to their dismay, I'm still here.  And I intend to be still here in November 2008.  So go to the caucus tomorrow.  Stand up for me for one night. 
[00:14:30]  So I can get up for you and together.  We'll make progress again.  And God bless you.  Oof.  I think she sounds terrific and just galvanizing.  Yeah.  Really sincere is what that sounds like.  It doesn't sound like a politician trying to excite a crowd.  Right.  And then.  But then the other day, I think everyone's surprised.  You got this out of Hillary. 
[00:15:00]  It's not easy.  What?  It's not easy.  Being rude.  And I couldn't do it if I just didn't, you know, passionately believe it was the right  thing to do.  You know, I have so many opportunities from this country.  I just don't want to see us fall backwards.  You know.  So.  You know.  I'm going to say something outrageous, but, you know, we are shock jocks.  You know.  This is why women shouldn't vote. 
[00:15:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Because one.  Shocking.  Because one.  One emotional clip from Hillary showing her human side.  And then all these people, all these women.  You got to think it was the women's.  The women that were.  A lot of women.  Yeah.  That were voting for Obama because of Oprah.  Yeah.  Heard Hillary as a human being kind of breaking down a little bit.  And all these women went.  Whoa.  Now I'm voting for her.  For her to her side. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  A bit fickle.  One lousy sound clip.  That's it.  And she gets the victory.  In my humble opinion.  Humble opinion.  I mean, what do you think?  Yeah.  I think you get those people that they just swing back and forth.  Have no idea what they want.  One little thing changes and their opinion goes, oh, oh, okay.  I'll vote over there.  And it's never some big thing that changed.  No.  Like to find out that the guy murdered somebody.  No.  It's just some subtle, dumb thing. 
[00:16:30]  And you go, oh, now I can't vote for him.  Yeah.  He likes anchovies on his pizza.  Well, crazy.  I can't vote for him.  I don't like those anchovies.  And then what did she say?  She said she found her voice now?  Yeah.  That was another clip.  She goes, I have found my voice.  Like she was kind of being robotic.  Right.  And insincere.  Right.  And now she realizes that this is her voice.  Yeah.  To speak to the people as people. 
[00:17:00]  We've been saying that for years.  She completely changed it around.  Yeah.  Someone just told her, you sound ridiculous.  Exactly.  Someone finally stepped up to her and said, and had the balls to say, look, you sound like  a robot.  No one's connecting with you.  You're not likable.  You're not real.  You're insincere.  You don't come off as honest.  You come off like this politician just trying to get elected instead of a person who cares 
[00:17:30]  about anything.  Even when she was talking about caring about the country.  When she do it in that voice, it just didn't come across as a caring person.  So now she's trying that.  Right.  Good luck to you.  She sounds like a shrill hen.  Mm-hmm.  Just cackling to try to get somebody to do something.  Oh, yeah.  While she's talking.  Yeah.  By the way, she barely won.  What did she get?  By 2%, 39, 37, I think.  Oh, thank you.  39 for Hillary, 37 for Barack.  They were expecting a complete blowout, though, by Barack. 
[00:18:00]  That's why they're surprised she won, even though it was by a small margin.  They weren't even expecting her to be close.  Right.  And that big-headed thing.  And it's so funny, because I didn't even think that the guy had a big head until I saw Jim  Norton on New Year's Eve.  Oh.  And now I can't even look at John Edwards the same way anymore.  His head is huge.  Just a stupid migger on stilts he looks like.  Had enough of that big stilts.  And he got, I think, 17%. 
[00:18:30]  So, all right, we're just getting started.  We got some more audio.  So, on the other side, I like to call the Anthony side.  Yes.  John McCain.  Yeah, John McCain.  We'll get into...  The Republican ticket.  We'll get into his audio and stuff after the break, but he won as far as the Republicans  go.  Mm-hmm.  And that scares the living crap out of me.  Well...  See, you know, Barack scares the crap out of you.  Mm-hmm.  McCain scares the crap out of me.  I don't see how that could be. 
[00:19:00]  He doesn't look like he's all there.  And it's not like Barack scares me.  Why?  It's not the same thing, I would say.  All right.  It's probably a different reason.  All right.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We'll talk about McCain.  We got to talk about Jimmy Tide 08 because now we got banners all over the studio.  Oh, there's posters now.  You see that, Jimmy?  Yes.  Yeah, Jimmy Tide 08.  If you weren't listening yesterday, we'll explain the Jimmy Tide 08 thing, including playing 
[00:19:30]  the clip from yesterday's show because it was really, really funny.  It was so funny that it became the second most Googled term or whatever yesterday.  Jimmy Tide 08 came in second place in Google Trends.  This kid's not making a move.  I mean, it's about change and he's about to change.  And also, we'll talk about Duncan Hunter all after the break.  Yes, that is the man I am backing for president of the... 
[00:20:00]  I am announcing it officially today in a press conference.  We didn't even know he existed until yesterday.  We'll explain that as well to the people that, for some reason, didn't feel like listening  to us yesterday.  Hey.  Got to listen every day.  Of course you do.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got to get right back into this.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Lots to do today.  We got to get, hopefully a little later, to the story.  It's the story of the day here in New York.  And I challenge the rest of the cities to come up with a better story. 
[00:20:30]  We do this from time to time.  Basically, a bunch of guys wheeled a dead guy around in a wheelchair trying to cash his  social security check.  Yep.  We'll get to that story in a few minutes, and we'll give the other cities a chance to  come up with a better story than this.  The headline is Abracadabra.  Ah, that's funny.  Abracadabra.  Opie and Anthony, phone number 877-212-ONA. 
[00:21:00]  A big hi to all the faithful, by the way.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  We did very, very well in the New York ratings yesterday, and we greatly appreciate that.  So yesterday on the show, we went to this website, and we answered a bunch of questions.  And basically, how you answer these questions, this website told you who you should vote for  in the upcoming election.  I was told I should vote for Hillary, followed by Obama.  I mean, they were pretty much neck and neck. 
[00:21:30]  Like, one point separated the two.  Yeah.  Jimmy was told to vote for both Hillary and Obama.  He tied.  And then, of course, no surprise with Anthony.  We knew it was going to be pretty right.  And I was thinking Giuliani.  I would have went all in with Giuliani.  I went a little further right than even Giuliani.  And Giuliani came in second.  It was your second choice, according to this website.  Yeah.  Your first choice was a guy named Duncan Hunter. 
[00:22:00]  We've never heard of him.  And we thought it was a joke.  We started thinking maybe this website's a joke.  But he really is a candidate, and he's pretty insane.  Well, yeah, but since I took the test there and it told me he's my candidate, who am I to say?  So I don't like any of the other candidates, the ones that are getting publicity, let's say.  The ones that have the heat, Obama and Hillary, McCain, I don't want any part of those candidates. 
[00:22:30]  So why not get one of these come-from-behind guys like Duncan Hunter?  He didn't even show in the primaries yesterday.  Mr. Blutowski, 0.0.  That's pretty much what he's got. 
[00:23:00]  I'm looking at the primary last night, the New Hampshire primary.  McCain, of course, 37% of the vote.  Yep.  And then we have all the other candidates, blah, blah, blah.  Who was second last night?  Romney.  What did he get?  32%.  Okay.  And Huckabee with 11%.  Giuliani got 9%.  Paul got 8%.  Thompson got 1%.  And then right behind Thompson with 0% of the vote. 
[00:23:30]  No, I like to 0.0.  0.0.  Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life.  No way to go through the primary.  That's Hunter got 0% of the vote.  Right.  Good old Duncan Hunter.  Okay.  Imagine why.  He's got some really moderate good views.  Yeah.  What are some of the things he stands for, this guy?  Well, at least we know what this guy stands for. 
[00:24:00]  See, this is what I like about our show.  Everyone else is talking about what Hillary stands for and Obama stands for.  Duncan Hunter.  Let's see what Duncan Hunter's all about.  My candidate.  And I'm officially, I'm officially, officially backing Duncan Hunter for president of these  United States.  Officially throwing my support behind Duncan Hunter.  Jimmy's looking at me like I'm crazy. 
[00:24:30]  You must have read the first one.  The test set, what, right to life amendment?  Oh, well.  What am I going to do?  I don't care.  I haven't had to get a chicken abortion.  I don't think ever.  It's a nice gift for Christmas.  Let me knock wood.  We got to get one of them abortions.  Just watching that last night.  Imagine if that was your Christmas present to your girl.  You opened it up and it's like something for Planned Parenthood.  She's like, I thought you were happy.  It's a gift card.  It's a gift card for Planned Parenthood.  It's a little pink card. 
[00:25:00]  One right foot, Doc Martin.  Free of charge.  Yes.  Yes.  Duncan Hunter says, stand on right to life.  I would amend the U.S. Constitution and provide blanket protection to all unborn children from the moment of conception by prohibiting any state or federal law that denies the personhood of the unborn.  So he wants, you know, as the Constitution, the preamble to the Constitution, we the people. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  We the people.  He wants the unborn children to be one of those people.  So he wants to change it to all the rights.  He wants to change it to we the embryos.  Right.  The embryos.  The embryos.  The fetus.  We the zygote.  Yeah.  We the zygotes.  Zygote.  So he thinks a zygote should be a human being or something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or have rights or.  I mean, he goes way far.  What is so what?  Every candidate. 
[00:26:00]  You have to be 100 percent with everything they say.  You got to balance things out in terms of what's important to you.  OK, and for me, the right to life issue, I'm not as important as long as we have a check  and balance system with a Democratic Congress, perhaps to fight anything, a court, a Supreme  Court justices that are a little more moderate.  These things keep that in check, that Roe versus Wade.  So, yeah, this guy, I don't understand. 
[00:26:30]  Also, how come there are laws in this country if you kill a pregnant woman that you're also  charged for the murder of the unborn child, yet there isn't a law against abortion?  That's kind of an odd double standard thing.  To kill a pregnant woman is just such a dick move.  Well, it is, but you should just have that as the bad thing.  You've done that. 
[00:27:00]  Society is just like, you know what?  You're a creep.  You're a dick.  Right.  If you're doing that, you're just a man.  Society is just trying to make a statement.  But it's semantics.  You're still, you know, technically killing.  What else do we know about?  If, you know, that's what you believe in.  Phyllis, philosophy of judicial appointments.  Now, this is how we would feel about appointing judges.  OK.  Supreme Court judges.  I support people with good judgment, proven values, a belief in God, and a heart for the least of us, including the unborn. 
[00:27:30]  So he would appoint people that would try to overturn Roe versus Wade.  This guy's obsessed with the unborn.  He really loves those unborn.  You should keep reading, too, because at least the guy is going to carry out the will of the people.  I believe it is important that those sitting on the bench understand that they have a responsibility to strictly interpret our nation's laws and not legislate from the bench with their own political or social agenda. 
[00:28:00]  I will not appoint judges who do not believe that the unborn are precious and should be protected.  So he won't even try.  That sounds reasonable.  He's at least open for discussion.  Oh, yeah.  Duncan Hunter for president.  What else?  What else is this guy?  His campaign slogan, it's like a button with a hanger and a circle and a red arrow for it.  Candidates.  At this point, he wants to ban hangers as well. 
[00:28:30]  This guy is as right as they come.  All suits should be thrown on the floor.  Right.  He certainly has.  I have co-sponsored the following legislation.  The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act.  I guess you can't take an abortion across state lines.  I have no idea.  The Human Cloning Prohibition Act.  The Parents' Right to Know.  Can I stop you for a second?  I got a question for Jimmy.  Jimmy, does this guy, Duncan Hunter, does he like the unborn?  He doesn't like the unborn. 
[00:29:00]  Duncan Hunter loves him.  Oh, loves him.  They're all he thinks of.  I've never even heard of this one.  The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act of 2006, which would require abortion providers to notify  women who want to have an abortion 20 weeks after fertilization, that the evidence suggests  that their unborn child feels pain and may request anesthesia for their unborn child in  order to reduce or eliminate the pain.  I actually think that makes sense. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  Enough about the unborn.  Yeah, it's just all he cares about.  The whole first page is that.  Okay, marriage.  Constitutional amendment defining marriage.  I firmly believe that marriage is one of the most important social institutions we have  and that it is essential to promoting family values and raising children in a healthy environment.  It is for this reason that I co-sponsored and voted in favor of H.J. Resolution 88, Musgrave, Colorado.  Uh-oh. 
[00:30:00]  Which proposes an amendment to the U.S. Constitution declaring that marriage in the United States  shall consist solely of the union of a man and a woman.  I firmly believe the children need the unique influence offered by both a father and a mother.  It's about the children.  I bet there's some skeletons in this guy's hard drive.  It's amazing.  And apparently they're the only ones voting for him.  How the hell did I get hooked up with this guy?  Because he's also a right-wing nut.  But also.  I support taking the actions necessary to strengthen our public education system and school vouchers 
[00:30:30]  are a great opportunity to provide students and their families with additional educational choices.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Hate crimes and sexual orientation.  I've always voted against this type of legislation.  I firmly believe the use of violence against any innocent person is wrong,  regardless of that individual's race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation.  Hmm.  That's odd.  You'd think this guy would be into, like, beating up gay people. 
[00:31:00]  Well, he's actually removing the hate crime.  I think he's against hate crime legislation.  Yeah.  He's against.  Oh, he is.  And he's saying that it's like, I believe in the crime.  Oh, I gotcha.  Strict punishment for hate crimes, like murder, regardless of social circumstance.  Okay, but he doesn't like this hate crime thing.  All right.  I'm for that, though.  Yeah.  I don't like the hate crime thing.  First Amendment.  Uh-oh.  I believe the current decisional law of the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment is inconsistent and flawed. 
[00:31:30]  For example, the recent decision on the Ten Commandments display, where the Supreme Court ruled that in Texas it is appropriate to have a Ten Commandments monument on the courthouse grounds.  But in Kentucky, the same display violates the established clause.  The Founding Fathers developed these clauses to guarantee the right of all citizens to worship and protect the church from the state, not to strip religion from everyday lives of Americans. 
[00:32:00]  So I guess he likes the Ten Commandments all over the place.  If it wasn't for unborn babies and God, this guy would have nothing to talk about.  This guy is really what they call a holy roller.  So this shouldn't be your candidate, then.  You're not a holy roller.  I certainly am not.  I don't know how I got hooked up with him.  And you love abortions.  I got to go for him.  You love abortions.  You hate kids and God.  So you're not dealing with this guy.  There is no God. 
[00:32:30]  I'm a man.  My name's Fred.  And I'm a man like you.  It's one of my favorite scenes from Caddyshack.  It's not the dumb scene.  Balanced budget, blah, blah, blah.  Federal obscenity laws.  Uh-oh.  I voted in favor of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005, which increased the penalties for violations by television and radio broadcasters who transmit obscene, indecent, and profane material on the public airwaves.  I don't think he's a fan of the O&A show. 
[00:33:00]  I also have concerns with the questionable material our children continue to have through the Internet and other entertainment products.  I believe these disturbing, harmful materials to young people should be held responsible.  People put an eon.  As a result, I drafted legislation, the Parents Empowerment Act, which will allow parents to sue any person who knowingly sells or distributes a product that contains material that is harmful to minors.  Oh, boy.  Empowering parents to protect their children from predatory practices of pornographic distributors. 
[00:33:30]  That is so vague, first of all.  And just more litigation that we need to empower parents to be able to sue people that put out what he calls pornographic material.  That could be anything.  It could be this show.  It could be this show.  It could be anything.  This guy is a jackass.  You can't support this guy anymore.  Now that we looked a little deeper into what he believes in.  He wants to sue the clerk at a GameStop. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, basically.  That's pretty much it.  All right.  We're done with this guy.  And he drafted the legislation.  He didn't just sign it in some poor moral bill.  No.  He wrote it up.  He licked his pencil tip and went, no, that's not strict enough.  Well, I have to do one more issue here that's important to me.  It's gambling.  All right.  Gambling.  I believe gambling is a serious problem in today's society.  Every much as addictive and destructive as alcohol and illegal drugs.  As a result, this problem is equally deserving of much attention in terms of federal policy.  Get more federal policy in there. 
[00:34:30]  Unfortunately, those individuals who spend most of their money gambling are the ones who have the least amount to lose, often choosing to gamble instead of taking care of their families.  Well, this guy with his family.  I also believe Internet gambling has become a problem as serious as traditional casino gambling.  Law enforcement agencies have indicated that this activity serves as a vehicle for money laundering activities that are exploited by terrorists and organized crime.  It is for that reason that I co-sponsored HR 4777, good late Virginia, which will amend federal law to bring the current prohibition against wireline interstate gambling up to date with the Internet and other new technologies. 
[00:35:00]  At the same time, the bill would provide additional tools to law enforcement to combat illegal gambling.  The guy's against gambling. 
[00:35:30]  He's against abortion.  He's against everything you believe in.  He's against funding for the National Endowment of the Arts at all.  The First Amendment.  He's against your livelihood, this radio show.  This radio show.  Someone is writing.  Oh, Scott from Hot Pog writes, Ant's candidate is a square.  He is a square.  And another person saying, Duncan Hunter is the anti-Anthony.  See, wow, what a change of events here.  Yesterday, we're thinking this guy was the perfect candidate for you. 
[00:36:00]  Now, it's obvious that this guy has to go away.  Yeah, I don't think I'm a fan of his much anymore, though.  Immigration.  Okay.  America is one of the most generous immigration policies in the world.  It is unacceptable that we allow millions of people to sneak in the back door of our country when the front door is available.  We've tried amnesty.  See, it does not work.  We must enforce and, as necessary, tighten our immigration laws and secure the borders.  It is a matter of national security.  That, I believe.  Okay.  I like that.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  One out of five.  Birthright citizenship reform.  Oh, boy.  That's one where he doesn't want illegal aliens that have babies here that the baby automatically becomes a citizen.  Right.  He thinks they should or shouldn't.  They shouldn't.  Wait a minute.  He's got rights for the kids all over the place.  Not brown children from Mexico.  But the babies are everything.  The babies should have the rights.  They should have their own little phone lines.  As long as they're American.  American babies.  That's what Duncan Hunter is for. 
[00:37:00]  American babies.  That's right.  All right.  We end the bit with Duncan Hunter.  He's a square.  He's a square.  Let's say hi to Chris from West Palm Beach, Florida.  Chris?  Good morning, gentlemen from West Palm.  How are you?  You're from West Palm.  We're here in New York City.  What's up, Chris?  I know.  Last night in the primaries, I wanted to know how Jimmy Tide did.  Yeah.  How did Jimmy Tide do?  This kid is sleeping in the nation.  I'm seeing posters of Jimmy Tide. 
[00:37:30]  Clean shirts and a cleaner America.  Yeah.  And people are Googling Jimmy Tide 08 like crazy.  Yeah.  Everybody knows Jimmy Tide.  This kid's just making his move.  And everybody recognizes what a clean shirt does to make you face your day better.  Right.  Let's play the clips from yesterday really fast.  So we go to this website once again.  We answer a bunch of questions.  And then it tells you what candidate you should vote for.  And like we said, Anthony, second place was Rudy Giuliani. 
[00:38:00]  And first place was this Duncan Hunter, this creep.  And then we...  Square.  Yeah.  And E-Rock was keeping track of Jimmy's answers.  So then it was time to find out who Jimmy should vote for according to the answers he gave on this website.  Mm-hmm.  And listen to what happened.  Here we go.  We go back to the tape from yesterday.  Now we go to E-Rock who was keeping track of Jimmy's answers.  Jim Norton, according to his website, should be voting for who?  Jimmy Tide for first place. 
[00:38:30]  Absolutely.  Man keeps clean shirts.  Poof.  Poof.  Oh.  Does that make you uncomfortable, Jimmy?  Not at all.  It was E-Rock's stupid mistake.  It was the way he said that.  It was the way he said it.  Cut it off right after he says Jimmy Tide.  Yeah, do it again.  Now, yeah, it sounds like there was a candidate obviously named Jimmy Tide.  We didn't know about Duncan Hunter.  Right.  So we figured Jimmy Tide was another candidate.  Right.  And the way E-Rock said it, the pause. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  The whole way he said it, it sounded like he meant Jimmy Tide was the name.  Yeah.  Basically, E-Rock was trying to say that Jimmy Tide for first place, meaning there's two candidates  he should vote for.  Yeah.  But that's not how he said it.  Well, you asked, too.  You said, who should Jimmy vote for?  And he said, Jimmy Tide, and then delay.  Listen again.  Now we go to E-Rock, who was keeping track of Jimmy's answers.  Jim Norton, according to his website, should be voting for who? 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy Tide for first place.  Jimmy Tide for first place.  Hold on.  And Jim Norton, we all know, is...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You told old flipper hints.  Poor E-Rock.  I know, to just stop it right after Jimmy Tide.  Yeah, what are you wearing?  Oven mitts today?  No, he's doing his German bestiality film later.  He's playing the part of the shepherd.  Got to duct tape those oven mitts on.  All right, right after Jimmy Tide for first place, you got to stop it. 
[00:40:00]  Not for first place.  Just Jimmy Tide.  All right, all right.  Because listen to how it sounds.  And now we go to E-Rock, who was keeping track of Jimmy's answers.  Jim Norton, according to his website, should be voting for who?  Jimmy Tide.  See, it just sounds...  The way you said it, Jimmy Tide.  And a story.  I got to be honest with you.  I really understood what E-Rock was getting at.  But Norton is so freaking quick. 
[00:40:30]  I think most people know that by now.  He was right on the fact that there's a candidate named Jimmy Tide,  and he went right into joke mode.  Right into the shirt joke mode.  At first, he just didn't even stop.  He didn't even hesitate at a yield.  He kept going.  That's why I started giggling, because I'm like,  oh, my God, I know exactly what he's doing here.  Yeah.  But wait.  He's going for his Jimmy Tide joke.  I'd like to know where I went into joke mode.  I didn't hear anything that resembled a joke.  No, that's true, too.  Just some line that was fired out. 
[00:41:00]  And you could actually, if you listen, you could hear like a thud.  Right.  And that was the joke.  It was like this.  Here's my shirt joke.  And then, so then we got to take a break here.  But then we just had a lot of fun with this.  And then Jimmy, Jim Norton, of course, had to explain the whole Jimmy Tide thing.  Yeah.  And it just went down.  And this is what happened.  I have a good joke.  Who should I vote for?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Stop.  You still think it's Jimmy Tide at this point, right?  I believe so. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  So you wanted him to repeat Jimmy Tide.  Yeah.  Right.  So he still thought there was a guy named Jimmy Tide.  Oh, no.  How bad.  Oh, you know why?  I was going to say something.  The man who loves beaches.  I had some awful.  Some horrible Tide joke.  Awful Tide joke, which God stepped in and saved us all from.  And this is how it went down.  Norton still thinking there's a candidate named Jimmy Tide.  I have a good joke.  Who should I vote for?  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 
[00:42:00]  No.  Oh, you want us to ask the question?  No, I was asking because it was the first choice.  Who's my first choice, Iraq?  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  Tide.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what happened?  Oh, no.  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That might mean a special.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Let me get set up.  If you knew how stupid I was. 
[00:42:30]  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Does anybody understand what I did?  Not yet.  No, I'm trying to figure it out.  This is why my joke bombed so horribly.  All right.  I swear to God, when you said Jimmy Tide, I thought that was the name of a candidate.  Oh, my God.  Hence the shirt joke.  That's why I said the man loves clean shirts. 
[00:43:00]  Jimmy Tide.  Back to the warning track.  Right near the wall.  Leaping.  And he made the catch.  Carlos Beltran right.  No, he didn't.  My apologies.  I thought he had it.  I thought he had it, too.  He acted as though he had it.  He did not have it.  He acted as though he had it.  I've made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Oh, my God.  And we're back alive.  The best part of that is when the revelation hits you that Jimmy Tide is not the candidate. 
[00:43:30]  One of you said Tide.  Tide, yeah.  And I immediately understood.  And then the, oh, no.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  That was a great one.  But what about Jimmy Tide?  I was just voting for him.  Lingus.  Hey.  Yeah.  It was a great moment yesterday.  And now we got this.  We got stuff all over the studio.  It says Jimmy Tide, 08, the American flag. 
[00:44:00]  What's the slogan?  I can't read it from here.  Your new eyes can read it, Jimmy.  My new one vision eyes, clean shirts, and a cleaner America.  That's the slogan for Jimmy Tide, 08.  And Jimmy Tide is a flag, and it says 08.  It's all over the message boards.  People are having a lot of fun with your little faux pas.  It really is in, like, that font, too.  Yeah.  That is for the election.  He likes clean shirts.  American flag.  Once again, encouraging people to Google Jimmy Tide, T-I-D-E, 08 today. 
[00:44:30]  Jimmy Tide, 08.  That's right.  It's sweeping the nation.  Sure is.  Oh, no.  I love that, man.  It's almost like if you'd never seen yourself in a mirror, and the first time you did,  you realized you had a big tongue and Pete Rose haircut.  All right, we're going to talk about the story of the day here in New York City next.  The headline, Abra Cadaver.  Next on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, boy.  We haven't had one of these in a while.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's that?  A very, very pissed off listener.  Yeah.  Extremely pissed off.  At, let's see, what could it possibly be?  Hmm.  Abortion?  He's so pissed off to the point he has to be put in a file, and he's got to be looked at.  New.  New Bomb Turk.  On instant feedback, he writes, 
[00:45:30]  Opie and Jimmy are going to alienate 50% of the listeners by bashing everything on the right.  Hmm.  50%?  I don't think so.  I don't think 50% of the people are hard right.  You know what I mean?  I'll always bash the hard right.  But he says.  Like we would the hard left.  Right.  But he says bashing everything on the right.  That is so ridiculously wrong, I can't even tell you.  Jimmy doesn't bash everything on the right.  Can I point out to this jerk? 
[00:46:00]  Well, let me.  Easy language.  How I spend most of my time bashing the far left, you idiots.  Exactly.  The guy only hears what he wants to hear.  What a dope.  Selective hearing.  Then he continues, good move, a-holes.  Way to win over the audience.  Don't let me catch you on the street, Opie or Jimmy, because I'll kick your ass.  There you go.  Well, that's a good way to exercise the freedoms of the United States of America, is if somebody  disagrees with you, you beat them. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, what an idiot this guy is.  Shut up.  Here's what you are.  You're using a phony name.  You're a douche.  Why don't you write in with your real name?  New bomb Turk.  You're a coward.  So Jimmy and I are going to get our ass kicked because this guy has his info wrong.  That's always good.  That's always good.  What are you going to swing at me?  An unborn fetus?  Shut your mouth.  What are they playing?  The greatest hits of 2007?  They're showing the guy punching the old lady in the face again. 
[00:47:00]  Why are they showing that?  I don't know.  I think it's a comic.  They're putting, like, Bob Saget funny noises in.  Boing.  That's what that guy's going to do to me and Opie.  Just give us a punch.  Yeah, boy.  We bash everything on the right?  It's just, he's a douche.  Are you crazy?  He's a douche who doesn't use his real name.  That's what he is.  What an idiot.  I bash politics in general.  Yeah, I'm bashing the right.  What do you think of that?  I'm bashing the right.  Take it, stupid.  Now what?  The right or the way right? 
[00:47:30]  The whole right.  Oh, now you're all about everything right.  Just to annoy him.  I'm Larry Liberal.  I hyphenate everything.  And you're a douche American.  At this point, Jimmy now writes with his left hand.  That's right.  What do you think of them apples?  He doesn't even acknowledge his right hand anymore.  No.  Unless he's, you know, taking care of business at home.  What do you think of that?  I don't like the idea that he pointed you two out, and he thinks I'm a guy that agrees  with him.  Right.  Well, all right.  There you go.  Hey, story of the day, Ty. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, we could talk politics all day.  It was a big day for politics yesterday, right?  Go Obama and the rest of the left.  By the way, speaking of Obama, we got a little oopsie from a Fox 5 New York anchor.  Uh-oh.  Does it start with an N?  No.  Here's a little oopsie from somebody here in New York City.  All right.  We want to get you up to date.  What's crossing on the wires right now?  AP is declaring Hillary Clinton the winner in New Hampshire.  Interesting race all night. 
[00:48:30]  Very close with Osama, I should say, Barack Obama.  That has been something that we've been watching all night.  Is that from Fox?  They've been doing that consistently.  Really?  Yeah.  It's this subliminal thing I think they're trying.  They keep calling him Osama.  It's Ernie Anastis, who's a legend here in New York, and he's not there anymore.  He knows how to read, but the guy is just so out of touch. 
[00:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  When it comes to actually having an interview or actually going off the paper.  Yeah.  He's awful.  He's absolutely awful, but he's a legend here in New York, and people love watching him  read the news for them.  All right.  But here's the story of the day.  You want to play the audio?  The audio, I think, is better.  We try to read the stories ourselves, but the audio is just terrific.  Listen to what happened here in New York yesterday. 
[00:49:30]  This is just unbelievable.  John Gregorio was a neighbor of the elderly dead man used as a pawn in the sick, fraudulent  plot to cash a disability check.  The morbid scam unfolded at this 9th Avenue pay-o-matic.  Mariano Galvez says the would-be scam artists first left the body out on the sidewalk.  Victor Rodriguez says the elderly dead man's head was hanging off the back of his office  chair.  It was obvious he'd passed away.  One of his friends brought him inside the store to cash a check, and when the teller asked 
[00:50:00]  who this check belonged to, he said it belonged to my friend, but he's asleep.  And, you know, and then I get the police game.  Oh, Jesus.  Where was this?  Some nice part of town where they wheel a dead man into a check cashing place?  Actually, it's the old Hell's Kitchen.  Yeah.  But the residents didn't like it being called Hell's Kitchen here in New York, so they changed  the name to Clinton.  Clinton.  Clinton to make it sound better.  But it's Hell's Kitchen. 
[00:50:30]  So your real estate goes up a bit.  Because no one wants to buy in Hell's Kitchen, but they would buy in Clinton.  It's not a bad area, actually.  That's by any other name.  It's really not that bad of an area.  Do you know what's so annoying?  It's on 10th Avenue, because you have Chelsea and you have Clinton, there's actually something  called the Chelsea slash Clinton health thing.  There it says, like, Chelsea.  Chelsea Clinton, yeah.  It's like, oh, that's kind of adorable.  I get it.  By the way, the name comes from Dewey Clinton. 
[00:51:00]  Dewey Clinton.  Who was a great New Yorker back in the day, according to my fine 20-hour New York City documentary  that I sat through.  Did he do anything good?  What did he do?  He's a creep.  That part of the documentary was so long ago, I don't even know anymore.  I really tried to digest a lot of this stuff from this documentary, but when it's over  20 hours long, I don't even remember what Dewey Clinton did anymore.  You can't retain everything.  I really don't remember.  At least you know the guy's name that Clinton's named after. 
[00:51:30]  Dewey Clinton was a pederast.  Give me a little info on Dewey Clinton, will you?  Here's the second part of the story.  Police say a detective eating at a nearby restaurant noticed a crowd gathering around  the deceased man's chair.  That's how cops so quickly arrested the fraudulent check cashers.  The check itself, by the way, reportedly worth only $355.  How great is that story? 
[00:52:00]  Wonderful.  $350.  They wheel the dead guy around.  That's desperation, wheeling a dead guy around for that much.  What'd they think that would do, having the dead guy with you?  They would think he's alive?  Yeah, like we just left him outside in the wheelchair, old.  Yeah, like they were like the guy's caretaker, like, well, where's the guy?  You're not this guy.  Yeah, they said in the story, and they pointed outside the bank.  Oh, there he is.  No, no, he's right there.  And they left the dead guy in the chair outside the bank or what happened. 
[00:52:30]  With his head hanging off the back.  Yeah, yeah.  Looking like Kenny sleeping on a plane.  The witnesses saw the two pushing the chair with Cintron flopping from side to side,  and the two individuals popping him up and keeping him from flopping from side to side.  Oh, my God.  This is like Weekend at Bernie's.  Yeah, that's what they were saying on the news.  They did.  So that's just unbelievable.  Unbelievable. 
[00:53:00]  Cute, cute story.  And what was the headline?  Did they have a goofy headline for it?  Abracadaver.  Abracadaver.  Why the abracadaver?  Like, what's magic about that?  He's dead and he didn't wake up.  Yeah, that's not, I don't think that's a good headline.  DeWitt Clinton?  It's not even Dewey Clinton?  No.  Oh, no.  I apologize to Dewey Clinton.  Yes, he's not a pederast. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, and I do remember now, thanks to Than giving me a post-it, he was largely responsible for the Erie Canal.  Dewey Clinton was a bore.  He liked digging holes and throwing water in them.  What a ghoul.  It brought an S-load of money into New York City because it made it a lot easier to get the goods into New York City.  Oh.  From everywhere else.  From there.  From wherever that Erie Canal goes.  Right, from over there.  But, DeWitt Clinton. 
[00:54:00]  DeWitt.  What a dummy.  What did he do?  Did he dig the holes?  Ah, he got the funding together.  Oh, what a guy.  People thought he was crazy to suggest that we actually, you know, dig a big river.  A big ditch.  That connected, what, the Great Lakes to the Hudson River there, right?  Yeah.  People thought he was insane for thinking this up, but it went through and brought in a lot of commerce.  A lot of trading.  Amazing.  A lot of molasses.  Now, we were getting our molasses, right? 
[00:54:30]  I don't know molasses.  Molasses.  How did we trade back then?  Beaver pelts and molasses we need.  Remember.  I got to go to the store for some molasses.  But remember when you started learning about, like, trading.  Textiles.  When you started learning in school about importing and exporting.  Yeah.  You didn't understand.  You were just a kid.  Like, what?  I just know I got stuff.  Yeah.  But you didn't understand how it got to America, and they started talking about import and export.  And that dumb word molasses came up.  Molasses.  Molasses.  It was very valuable. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Not anymore so much.  I don't even know why it was ever valuable.  What do you do with molasses?  You put on everything back then because the food would rot.  They didn't have refrigerators.  You just have to cover everything in molasses.  My steak has flies on it.  Can you pass the molasses?  Rotted meat and bad apples.  Whatever else they ate.  Stupid wooden teeth.  Hey, we missed something on this story.  We got a bunch of people calling in.  We'll take Pete the Trucker's call.  Pete, what's up?  This is Keith the Trucker.  Well, it says Pete on the line. 
[00:55:30]  I'm sorry.  What's up, Keith?  I thought I heard the announcer say the last name of the dead guy was Gregorio.  Oh, that was a horrible pile up here.  Hey, what am I missing, though?  David from Wisconsin.  David?  Are you a cheese man?  I forget that every time until it pierces my brain.  There are fans of my obnoxiousness, and there's a lot of people that aren't fans of it, and 
[00:56:00]  that just makes me very happy every day.  David, what's up?  Oh, a young up.  He couldn't handle the are you a cheese head.  Zippy Del says, I like molasses on my Jimmy Dean's sausage.  Sausages.  Molasses sucks.  Of course it does.  Who enjoys a cup of molasses?  I'd like a bowl of molasses, please, to go.  I'm in a rush.  It's to go.  What'd you do with it? 
[00:56:30]  Just get sticky.  Imagine trying to eat, like, a plastic, you know those awful styrofoam cereal bowls?  Yeah.  Imagine filling that with molasses and trying to eat it with a plastic spoon.  Your bowl would bend because it'll pressure you.  It's so heavy.  You'd have molasses all over your cufflinks.  Molasses.  Everyone does.  Give me one good thing about molasses.  It's to anyone.  Get freaking Wikipedia it.  I don't care.  Do something.  Why molasses?  Probably because you could use it, like, as KY in a pinch. 
[00:57:00]  People are saying rum.  Oh, well.  There you go.  You make rum with molasses.  Now we completely understand, right?  All right.  Who doesn't understand a good rum drink?  I like molasses.  Except for Jimmy, who had to quit drinking at 13 years old.  That's right.  My first drink, incidentally, was of the molasses variety.  Rum and Coke, right?  Rum and Coke.  My first drink was Blackberry.  The worst thing you could possibly...  Blackberry brandy?  That was the first drink I ever had was my dad's awful Blackberry brandy because everything 
[00:57:30]  else was gone in his liquor cabinet.  And, you know, you bring the guys over.  Everyone's out of town.  You're like, all right, time to start this drinking thing we've heard so much about.  Let's go see what dad's got.  He doesn't have the good stuff because I guess he had a party recently and the last thing  left was Blackberry brandy.  That was a can of Coors.  Yeah?  Yeah.  See, that's a good one.  Drank the whole thing down and I was so, like, pleasantly buzzed that it started a career 
[00:58:00]  that would last a lifetime.  Chasing that, huh?  It was a great...  Like, the first full beer I ever had.  Because I remember being a kid and walking up to the picnic table when my father was out  back with all the friends and everything.  And they had the old cans of Schaefer with the big metal seam up the side and you needed  the can opener to open it.  Yeah.  And I would take it off the table and he goes, you better put that down.  I was like, I just want a sip.  And he'd go, okay.  So I'd take a little sip of beer and that was it. 
[00:58:30]  But it was the first full can of beer that I had and it was like this great, like, woo,  I feel a little woozy and cool and this is nice.  I don't feel as insecure.  Yeah, this is great.  I feel like I'm on top of the world.  I was talking to everybody.  Wonderful.  See, that's interesting because the Blackberry Brandy didn't work out so well for me and  maybe that's why I'm not a raging alcoholic. 
[00:59:00]  Ah.  Hmm.  Hey.  Oh, you're right there.  I'm sorry.  Raging.  This is usually what we talk about when you're not here.  It's just a joke.  But, uh, no.  Hey.  Blackberry Brandy didn't do the same thing that you just described.  It was just awful.  It tasted awful.  It just made me really sick.  Yeah, well, that'll do it.  Blackberry Brandy.  What was my...  I'm going to have a slow gin fizz.  Yeah? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I drank like an old lady here.  Oh, that's all right.  What?  Slow gin fizz.  Slow gin fizz.  That was like a kid drink, though, too.  Like...  It was very sweet.  Yeah.  And you'd always vomit it up.  Well, then we discovered rum and cokes, and then, you know...  There you go.  Pictures of rum and cokes went down very nice.  Jack and coke.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right.  Hey, we got an FU line.  We're trying to get some of the old things back on the show. 
[01:00:00]  We're trying to get Whip'em Out Wednesday working.  You know?  We're trying to bring that back big time.  We're trying to get the FU line going again.  We're trying to do...  What did we learn at the end of the Opie and Anthony show?  So keep that in mind as you're listening to this nonsense.  But right now, we'll go to the FU line and see what's going on here.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  I'd like to leave a big f***ing you to f***ing driving in the left-hand lane on 93 southbound. 
[01:00:30]  We think it's f***ing cool to drive at 40 miles an hour.  Well, I'm trying to get to work, and I'm already late.  F*** you.  Next message.  I want to put a big f***ing you to my boss, who decided not to give anybody in the company Christmas bonuses.  He could fly his ass to California for vacation.  I hope your plane crashes and you die on the way back.  F*** you.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to leave a f***ing you to the Department of Personnel in New Jersey for f***ing up the fire department lieutenant promotional exam. 
[01:01:00]  F*** you, DRC.  F*** you.  Next message.  I just want to give a big f***ing you to whoever got in this accident that I have in the city right now.  F*** you.  I hope he died.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big f***ing you to my boss for tracing in late every day and then getting on my ass for wasting time.  F*** you!  Next message.  I'd like to give a big f***ing you to Iowa.  I'm sick of hearing about your cockuses.  Suck my f***ing. 
[01:01:30]  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Jimmy's getting ready for a big tour.  The rooms are getting bigger, Jimmy.  I noticed.  They're getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  Borgata's all sold out.  And it's funny.  In February, I'm doing Poughkeepsie Bananas Comedy Club and Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco. 
[01:02:00]  There goes that series.  But I am doing the egg at Albany.  No, but after that, the rooms are getting bigger.  Yeah, a lot of theaters in Cleveland, Atlanta, Denver, and Minneapolis.  There's a transition going on with our little pal here.  He's moving into the bigger rooms.  The big rooms.  He's going big, big, big.  You know, I'm almost sold out in Minneapolis.  I've never been there before.  That's pretty cool.  I'm very happy.  I'm going to do all Mary Tyler Moore jokes.  At the end, you should throw your hat up in the air. 
[01:02:30]  I don't even do that.  My grandmother used to hate when I'd talk to the theme song of The Jeffersons because  she looked forward to it all week.  The Jeffersons?  She loved that.  I look forward to this song.  I look forward to it.  Why would she look forward to this?  Who knows?  Maybe because she was in diapers?  I don't know.  What else is she going to look forward to?  Life's over when you look forward to Janet Dubois singing this idiocy. 
[01:03:00]  By the way, you all know that was from Good Times.  Walona sang this.  If anyone didn't know that.  Well, now we do.  Walona sang this.  Of course she does.  Common knowledge.  Things don't burn the grill.  Burn the grill.  I did not know that.  You'll never think of anything else.  Wow.  And I can't see Janet Jackson without wanting to burn her with an iron.  Remember that one?  Of course.  Little penny.  Stupid penny. 
[01:03:30]  Let's say hi to Jeremy in the Windy City.  He's calling the Opian Anthony Show.  Jeremy?  Hey, good morning, guys.  What's up, Jeremy?  Hey, not much.  I just wanted to thank you guys for being refreshingly politically incorrect.  You guys are awesome.  And I wanted to make a comment on the fact that a black man can make it to the President of the United States.  I was in a sociology class a while ago, and this girl who was dating a black guy kept harassing the class all the time about how he was oppressed because he couldn't get anywhere because of his color. 
[01:04:00]  And I thought, come on, give me a break.  You know, you are what you are, and you make the best of what you can.  And any minority group out there that has made it big has had a rough start, a rocky start, and you make the best of your situation.  And thank you guys for making that point.  And he did get somewhere.  He got in her pants.  What is she talking about?  Where off do you need to be? 
[01:04:30]  That's quite an accomplishment right there.  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  We asked for a molasses fact, and this came in from Cleveland, Ohio.  Is it fun fact?  Not really.  Wednesday?  Just a quick molasses fact.  Damn, I can never.  By the way, good afternoon to Cleveland.  And poo.  And poo.  And poo.  And poo.  How did that work out for you?  Huh?  Fat boy.  That didn't work out for you.  Did it, boys?  It's Rick from Cleveland.  He writes, the Boston molasses disaster was a famous incident involving the substance which occurred 
[01:05:00]  on January 15th, 1919.  1919.  So the anniversary's coming up.  Wait, January 15th?  I want cards.  I thought it was the 17th.  Yeah, it's the 15th.  Yep.  A large molasses storage tank burst and flooded a neighborhood of Boston.  I went on a tour and I learned all about this.  I think it was in the North End there.  You did.  Killing 21 people.  Oh, in molasses.  Can you imagine? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, that would be a horrible way to go.  Just think of like a fly in like fly paper.  Is it drowning or suffocating?  I wonder.  I'm just walking and they get stuck in the street.  I suffocate.  I think you're...  Stuck there.  Drunk.  I'm with Jimmy.  I think you die of stickiness.  21 dead.  Did they blame it on black people like they do up there in Boston?  The molasses that rolled right over their racial progress.  21 dead, 150 injured.  The flood advanced as fast as how many miles an hour, Anthony? 
[01:06:00]  How fast did you think molasses could travel?  A whopping 3 miles per.  3.2 per?  How about...  That's probably very fast.  35 miles an hour.  Ah.  This tank broke and this molasses went a-flying.  Yeah.  Taking out 21 people, killing 150.  Get in your houses, this molasses.  Coming!  What?  Molasses!  And why did they have to store so much molasses in a big tank? 
[01:06:30]  One tank.  Because they had to make their rum.  Is that what it was for?  Yes.  All right.  What else is molasses good for?  We already learned that today.  Killing people.  It's a great weapon.  We ought to use it in Iraq.  Just dump molasses in the streets.  They'll just die somehow.  It gets stuck and just can't be rescued.  Tippy Tom.  So, you go to onaradio.com today and you got Steven S. from Bayshore's Fine Rundown, which  I read every day.  Yes.  Religiously. 
[01:07:00]  He's very, very funny.  He gets censored pretty badly, but...  Yeah.  I hear there was a TV type of censor that was done yesterday.  You know in your favorite movie, you're watching it and it's an R-rated movie made with some  bad language and they put in a dumb word that makes no sense just to get past that  part where they might use the F word or something like that.  It shows that the kid's talented because it's still funny even though, you know, some of  these guys behind the scenes are censoring poor Steven.  Yeah.  Who's rewriting? 
[01:07:30]  I don't mind...  Yeah.  Who's doing the rewrites?  You can't put this...  What was censored?  The line was, they were talking about the Iranians that were on those small little boats that  were harassing our giant battleships.  Right.  Or not battleships, but our carrier group, I believe.  And that's straight there in Iran where all the oil comes flowing through.  So we have to protect that area and make sure that we get our oil.  And there were a couple of these boats with these Iranians in it threatening to drive them 
[01:08:00]  into the ships and blow them up.  So I think Steve referred to them as filthy savages.  Right.  And they rewrote it as filthy dinghies.  You're right.  That's a TV edit.  It's a TV edit.  Because what?  The boat?  I got two problems.  It's like a dinghy?  I got two problems.  That shouldn't have been edited.  But if you are going to edit it, you got to do... 
[01:08:30]  Oh, let's see.  They're showing it on the news right now.  You got to do a little better than filthy dinghies.  Look at that filthy dinghy going through the water.  What is that?  What the hell is a filthy dinghy?  That, apparently.  Our enemies.  We can't even call them filthy savages?  Yeah.  These guys were threatening to blow up boats and blow themselves up.  It's a savage way of warfare.  Yeah.  And they are filthy.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just the way it is. 
[01:09:00]  But you can't say.  Are they afraid that the Iranians are going to...  What sympathy, first of all, is an Iranian group going to have by protesting the station  or the company?  Like, they're not really going to have the sympathy that Asian groups have or other groups that  are here in America.  You're really not...  It's not going to...  Don't worry about it so much.  Well, who actually made the edit?  We can find out.  Yeah.  Who made the edit?  We'll find out. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, man.  Let's say hi to Tony real fast.  Tony, go ahead.  Oh, I was just wondering what the website was that you see to vote for president.  It's on onaradio.com, but it's wqad.com.  But the problem is, it's hard to find that way.  But it is on there if you look closely.  My company blocks your whole...  Okay, then try wqad.com.  Where do you work?  CBS?  Block your show. 
[01:10:00]  Are you Tom Chiasano's assistant?  That's Tom himself.  Does he make you wear boring ties?  He's calling with a little rag over the phone.  Hello?  Hello, I'm down the hall.  It's the website.  I'm a big fan.  My company blocks your show.  I'm a big fan.  I'm calling from down the hall, and we're not allowed to admit that we actually like your  show.  Yeah, try wqad.com.  I appreciate it.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Anyway, the other thing that's on onaradio.com, if you haven't been there in a while, is Coke  Logic's animation of The Return of Tippi Tom. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  Which is very funny.  And I mention that because we also have a little bit that the boys put together, Danny  and Derek.  It's called Tippi Tom Books on Tape.  Ooh.  Now, for the newbies out there, Tippi Tom is our homeless friend.  We've known him for a really, really long time.  He's hardcore homeless, too.  Yeah.  And he is smelly.  Oof.  And homeless.  Worst smelling homeless guy I've ever smelled. 
[01:11:00]  And I don't think Anthony could get past that fact to realize that this guy, Tippi Tom,  is hilarious.  Oh, I know he's hilarious, but I just can't take the stench.  What am I wearing in this clip, in this animation?  You're wearing a yellow raincoat.  Is that what I got on in the animation?  To protect yourself from the germs.  That's funny.  It's really funny.  An outbreak suit kind of a thing.  And then I saw, I think it's on Danny's MySpace page, Danny doing an impression of Tippi 
[01:11:30]  Tom.  Yeah.  And he does a very good Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Uh, so anyway, uh, Tippi Tom's hilarious, and I guess Danny threw him in a studio and  had him read from some famous books, and they came up with this fine bit here for the Opie  and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature is proud to present a collection of books on  tape, soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippi Tom.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it, but you know. 
[01:12:00]  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago.  Never mind how long precisely.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom. 
[01:12:30]  Good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way through Mark Twain's classic,  Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the window of Douglas's protection.  Okay, I guess I'm getting it right.  And then be prepared to have your breath taken away, literally, with his read of Great Expectations.  Heaven knows we'd never be ashamed of our tears, okay? 
[01:13:00]  Of course not.  Anyway, I think I got silver right.  And finally, you'll enjoy the classic for all ages, Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.  Great eggs and ham.  No, green eggs and ham.  See, I can't see one of my glasses.  I am Sam.  I am Sam.  Sam, I am.  Come on, man.  I got my damn glasses on.  Who even knew Tippi Tom had glasses? 
[01:13:30]  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's a collection of some of the finest literature ever written, and then read by a homeless drunk.  Order Tippi Tom Books on Tape today.  That's pretty good, man.  Very good.  Green Legs and Ham.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I mean, we've tried over the years, because people saw the latest video and pictures of Tippi Tom,  and his legs are in really bad shape. 
[01:14:00]  And he's going to lose his legs.  And people are like, you guys got to do something.  We've tried everything with this guy.  We really have.  That's why I said he's hardcore homeless.  He doesn't take help.  He's been out on the streets for years and years and years.  And he's one of those homeless guys that it's not a guy that's down on his luck that needs a job or this or that.  He's just going to be like that.  Some people just are like that.  That's it.  There's nothing you can do to help them.  Speaking of the homeless, I'm reading an instant feedback here, and it reminded me of something,  which will lead to, I think, something Jimmy was talking about only a mere 15 minutes ago, not on air yet. 
[01:14:30]  But this guy writes, Opie, he's not your homeless friend.  If he was your friend, you'd let him stay at your house.  Hold on.  Stay at your place until he got on his feet.  With that said, I had a thought recently around the holiday, and I swear to you,  there's this homeless guy in my neighborhood that I give money all the time to.  I don't give money to all the homeless.  Which does he look like?  Is he the one with the dreadlocks?  He's the one with the white guy. 
[01:15:00]  He's got a beard, longer hair.  He's usually in the park.  I watch him do knuckle push-ups to try to stay in shape.  He seems relatively normal as far as the homeless people go.  And I give him money all the time, and he's been homeless for years.  I had the thought around Christmas to actually, Anthony's going to freak out,  invite him to my place to get a shower and a warm meal.  You're crazy.  Yeah.  You're crazy.  That just leads to him killing you and taking like 10 bucks. 
[01:15:30]  Well, I played it out of my head, and I'm right there with you.  I'm like, okay, what are you thinking?  This is stupid.  This will end really, really badly.  You can't turn these guys around on your own.  No.  Especially since you're bringing lice into your place.  You're showing him a great place that he's never going to live in.  You're showering him, putting him in his awful clothes,  and then booting him back out into the cold.  Yeah.  But I had the thought.  Well, good. 
[01:16:00]  You had a thought.  Yeah.  Keep it at that.  And then I was like, wow, what are you thinking?  This is dumb.  And isn't there a story that you were talking about, Jimmy?  Yep.  It's a homeless man pleads guilty to stabbing.  Now, people get stabbed all the time.  It's not that crazy, but it's a lovely story.  A homeless drifter Tuesday admitted to fatally stabbing a Queens College student  who welcomed him into his family's home.  Ah, see?  Emmanuel Manny Policano, 22, pled guilty or pleaded guilty in Queens Supreme Court 
[01:16:30]  to manslaughter and assault in a brutal October 30, 2006 attack  on Hunter College student David Higgins, 19.  Not surprising.  David Higgins, a young, liberal, well-intentioned man.  Uh, Policano also admitted to bashing Higgins' mother over the head with a baseball bat.  Um, Vern, her name was Vern Culberson.  Uh, wow, she just hit her birth certificate and got a new name put on there.  Vern Culberson, 54, needed 15 stitches in her head and still suffers from vertigo. 
[01:17:00]  Uh, Higgins, a Bronx High School of Science graduate,  confronted Policano about a missing Sony PlayStation  and Policano responded by stabbing him repeatedly with kitchen knives.  All right.  So this vermin, uh, they bring the guy into their home,  he steals the PlayStation,  and then when they confront him, he stabs the son  and when the mother comes in, he clonks her over the head with a bat. 
[01:17:30]  And, um, this is where, really, it shouldn't even be a trial,  you should just kind of rest your head on a desk  and they should put a bullet in the back of your head  because you're a roach.  By the way, uh...  By the way, that's crazy talk  because that's something like somebody on the right would say.  I know, yeah, you're right.  Yes.  That dope that wrote that instant feedback.  Listen to the show longer, will ya?  They're stabbing, he's stabbing, the son and the mother comes in.  What are you doing? 
[01:18:00]  You're holding a knife.  Are you trying to cut a piece of that apple pie I made?  Oh, he's such a helpful, he must be helping my son.  Cut a tag off his shirt.  I got hit twice because I wasn't finished yet.  She keeps standing up, too.  Stay down, Rock.  Yeah, just stay down.  Hey, in other news, good news for Jimmy's Cowboys, 
[01:18:30]  Jessica Simpson will not attend the Giants' Cowboys game this weekend.  That's good news for you.  And are they saying because she's got prior commitments, she's busy?  Uh, well...  Guaranteed.  The story's taken off to the point that she can't show up now  because everyone is talking about it.  Yeah, yeah.  But...  They boo her.  They're starting to hand out Jessica Simpson masks  for everybody that's going to the game.  Where's the game, by the way?  Does it have authentic French features?  The mask?  She's recording an album. 
[01:19:00]  She's recording an album, that's why she can't go?  She'll be watching it on TV.  So it's in Dallas.  That's why she can't make it.  What a load of crap.  But in the paper today, I saw that they're handing out Jessica Simpson masks,  so that's, I guess, some of the Giant fans  that just happen to be in the area that are going to the game?  Probably.  Okay.  It's funny.  Oh, man, if the game was up here, forget it.  The whole stadium would be filled with Jessica Simpson masks.  I hate the Giants, by the way.  Go, Pats!  And F the Cowboys as well.  No.  Big blue.  Ah, let's see.  Goose Gossage. 
[01:19:30]  Yes, made it.  He made it into the Hall of Fame.  Jim Rice and Mark McGuire did not make it.  Mmm.  Mark McGuire had a better...  They just don't know it's Mark McGuire.  Huh?  I think Mark McGuire's dead because this new guy has little round John Lennon glasses.  He's emaciated and cries like a woman.  And plays golf now.  Yeah.  He doesn't look like Mark McGuire.  You know, I was telling Jimmy, Mark McGuire should absolutely be in the Hall of Fame.  The steroids are all over the place.  It's not like it's an isolated case with the steroid thing. 
[01:20:00]  And he saved baseball with that whole home run race with Sammy Sosa.  Yep.  People hated baseball.  That was a biggie.  People forget that a lot of hardcore fans gave up on baseball.  And then Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa doing that home run thing brought a lot of people  back to baseball.  For that alone, he should be in the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Jimmy's shaking his head.  No, no.  I'm listening to you.  I'm talking to Jim Rice.  I also think had a pretty good run, man.  It's kind of...  16 years.  Yep.  The sportswriters are such babies. 
[01:20:30]  You're a bunch of crybabies who, when a guy like Eddie Murray or any of these guys  blow you off, because you write whatever you want, you attack them relentlessly.  And when they blow you off, you pay them back by not voting them into the Hall of Fame.  Right, right.  You're a bunch of douches, sportswriters.  Rice didn't really talk to the media that much, right?  Right.  He shouldn't.  I'm not really sure.  That's what he said.  16 years, 382 home runs, 1,451 runs batted in, and a .298 average. 
[01:21:00]  So that's a 300 average for a slugger.  It's not bad.  He's one of those guys that's kind of like on the bubble.  Like, when you see who gets voted into the Hall of Fame, you're like, oh, yeah, of course.  And then there's these guys that are like, oh, yeah, he could go either way.  I think Jim Rice is one of those could go either way type of players.  Maybe, but he was 1978 MVP, and he was an eight-time All-Star.  Yeah, that's pretty impressive.  I mean, you're MVP and an eight-time All-Star.  I mean, I think the guy earned his way in.  Especially in the 70s, to be 18 shy of 400 home runs, that used to be like an automatic  Hall of Fame. 
[01:21:30]  That's right.  You're right.  You know?  In the 70s.  400 was one of those benchmarks they look for.  Travis is absolutely right.  And Goose Gossage.  Of course he is.  Goose Gossage has to, like, shave that dumb mustache of his.  He's still got it.  I got a theory on that whole thing.  When someone has this unique look when they're really famous, and then they go away, they  feel like they have to keep this unique look, even though the times have changed.  Yeah, just so people recognize them, I guess.  So people go, oh, my God, it's obviously Goose Gossage, because look at the mustache.  Yeah.  You don't need to do that, Goose.  Get rid of that ridiculous mustache of yours, especially because it's now gray and just 
[01:22:00]  doesn't look healthy whatsoever.  I'm sure Raleigh Fingers still has the dumb, twisty mustache somewhere.  The oldie time 1800s bicycle with the big front wheel mustache.  And there's only one reason they do it.  They don't like that look anymore.  Back in the day, it was a cool look, because it kind of went with the times.  Yeah.  He wants to be recognized when he's at his restaurants and stuff.  That's all that's about.  And you might be right about Jim Rice, by the way, being on the bubble. 
[01:22:30]  I just did a little math.  Divided by 16 years, it's an average of 24 home runs, 91 runs batted in a year, which  is good.  But I don't know if that's all.  You know, that's a good point.  I think he's just, I think he just meant, but Mark McGuire, stop.  Just throw him in there.  Except the fact that the steroids thing has been a big part of baseball for many, many years.  Yeah.  583 home runs.  Yeah.  500.  And he had a lot of injury problems.  Injuries, and his career was cut short.  I mean, if he, you know, a lot of these guys who play, what, 20 years, he made it to 15 
[01:23:00]  or 16.  He could have easily been well into the 600 home run category there.  If they're going to, if they're really going to be that strict about what's fair and not  fair, they got to take all of the white pitchers out that didn't have to face black sluggers.  I won't say the white hitters, because black pitching still is not as big.  They're not as big in baseball.  I think that they still would have done the same thing.  But the white pitcher that didn't have to face...  Hey, Jimmy the Greek. 
[01:23:30]  What are you talking about?  I'm saying when you look at it, black pitching exists.  It can be very strong.  But I think that, you know, I still think that Babe Ruth would have hit that many home runs.  But I don't think those pitchers would have done as well.  Yeah.  All right.  So there you go.  And then we got this, they found the hiker in Georgia.  And, you know, to that dope that, I'm obsessed with that dope that wrote that instant feedback.  Why?  Because I don't mind if you don't like May or Jimmy or Ann or the show in general, but at  least...  Everyone likes me. 
[01:24:00]  At least, like, listen to the show long enough so you understand the show.  This guy thinks we bash everything on the right.  That's so ridiculous.  We're hardcore death penalty advocates here on this show.  Did he write back with his real name?  No, of course not.  Of course he didn't.  But he wants to beat us up if he sees us on the street.  Yeah.  This hiker in Georgia.  They found her.  Dead.  Of course.  Blow to the head.  Decapitated.  Tell me why this guy shouldn't get the death penalty. 
[01:24:30]  Can't think of a reason.  Seriously.  Tell me why.  Of course.  Tell me why.  She's just out for a little hike and this is what she gets?  A horror you got to deal with.  Some people, I never think of that.  Oh, what?  The death penalty.  Well, it's this, that, or the other thing.  There are many reasons people don't like it.  But they never think of that moment of horror and sheer terror that the victim had to go  through, sometimes for days and days on end, just a horrible murder and, ugh, never think 
[01:25:00]  of that when the guy is in court in a suit with the hair all nice and the stupid lawyer  next to him.  You know what?  That makes him any less a savage that he was when he was hacking someone apart and cutting  people's heads off.  Just imagine what the family has to go through.  You have a family member that has, like, the flu and you almost want to, like, kill yourself 
[01:25:30]  just to make the person feel better.  Can you imagine you have to live your life after this went on with someone in your family?  I think the worst thing that the survivors of murders like that has to deal with is the  what were they thinking when that just nightmarish situation was going down, like a rape murder  and then a slow torture, having to watch other loved ones being killed. 
[01:26:00]  And the family's got to just, you can't wrap your mind around it.  You can't think of it long enough or you'll drive yourself nuts.  They're also investigating him for the murders of other people, a really old couple.  They think this guy had obviously done other killings, too.  And if the death penalty is nothing more than just revenge for the surviving members of the  family, so be it.  I don't care about this goddamn punishment and the cost. 
[01:26:30]  We need rehabilitation and it doesn't do this or that or the other thing.  Just revenge, vengeance, just to avenge the death of a loved one by the family.  That's good enough a reason for me, you know?  And someone just wrote it.  DJ, he writes, it costs more to kill someone than keep them in jail for life.  Who cares?  We'll pick up the tab.  Yeah.  I'll pay for one.  Yeah.  I'll pay for one, too. 
[01:27:00]  You can privatize it.  I'll pay for one or two.  So you can invite your friends a few six-packs.  I have no problem.  I have no problem with that.  I'll pay for one or two.  Who's with me?  Just one or two.  Just awful.  All right.  As soon as he pointed out where the body was, and it was headless.  As soon as he goes, yes, I did that.  There it is.  Pop.  Pop.  Right in the back of the head.  They should have video taped it so people knew that he led them there.  Look, he shot him in the back of the head.  Where did I leave it?  Oh, yeah.  There's the headless. 
[01:27:30]  There you go.  It's gone.  Goodbye.  It's pathetic.  Every state is pretty much getting rid of the death penalty.  I mean, most states haven't used the death penalty in a really, really long time.  Jersey's getting rid of it, right?  Or did they?  They did.  They did.  Bring back old Sparky.  I like how they call the electric chair old Sparky.  I'm kind of glad they get rid of it.  Strap him in.  Oh, stop.  You and your one guy out of every million that gets killed.  But there's more than that, though.  Oh, no, there's not. 
[01:28:00]  There are.  No, there isn't.  I just don't have enough faith in the fact that only the guilty will get it.  What if the DNA proves it, Jimmy?  Because you're all about the DNA thing, and I'm with you with that, because there are a lot of guys in jail that have proven that they didn't do the crime, and they sat there for a long time.  But let's say this guy, DNA proves he decapitated her, would you like to see him dead?  I would like to see him dead even without the DNA.  I'm not talking about me.  Of course, I'd like to see all of them dead.  The pedophile should be shot. 
[01:28:30]  I'm only saying I don't think that it's a fair enough system where everybody's getting the exact same treatment.  That's all it is.  You're looking liberal, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  You're alienating half the audience.  You really are.  The half not on death row.  Hey, we're going to try to go for a laugh after that horrific story.  And we'll get into other things after the break.  But, you know, we've been doing that bleep game, and we played the Count from Sesame Street. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Bleeped.  Well, we got a new one here that Danny came up with.  Nice.  Let's see how this one sounds.  You know, a very popular song a lot of people know.  You can throw a few bleeps in there, and the song sounds a bit different.  Changes the whole thing.  Let's take a listen.  I am here today to give you all a show and tell.  And today, my show and tell is about my work.  Most people want a doggie or a yellow parakeet. 
[01:29:30]  But if you ask me, I would say there's nothing quite as neat as a...  It doesn't wag its tail, and it doesn't sing all day.  But you never have to walk it, and it doesn't run away. 
[01:30:00]  It's quiet, and it's friendly, and it's always very neat.  And you never have to bathe it, and it never has to eat.  Oh, you can have your hamsters and your goldfish by the score.  If I live to be a hundred, I will never ask for more than my rock. 
[01:30:30]  My rock.  What once was at the bottom of the sea?  What hurts if I should drop it on your knee?  What forms the firm foundation of a wall? 
[01:31:00]  What makes the very bestest pet of all?  That's right, a rock.  Oh, poodlepups and parakeets are all you ever see.  And rocks are only really loved by guys like me.  But let me tell you, mister, if you had one, you'd agree.  There's nothing quite so wonderful or truly grim-markable as a... 
[01:31:30]  My old faithful...  All right, one vision.  Oh, not another live read?  You're good.  I'm good, man. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  People suggest stuff all the time for the radio show.  And this is a visual, so if you're at your desk, maybe not in your car, or maybe when  you get to work or you get back home a little later, you might want to throw in the goddess  bunny.  I'll even spell out goddess for you. 
[01:32:30]  G-O-D-D-E-S-S.  The goddess bunny into YouTube.  Look at this fat pig.  And check out a very disturbing video.  Yeah, I've seen that.  I don't know what it is.  It's some kind of crippled whatever thingy.  It's a girl.  It could be an adult with some kind of disease.  I don't even know.  Like the Jerry's kid's disease or something.  She's got the thinnest legs I've ever seen.  She can't be more than four. 
[01:33:00]  Thin without being hairy.  That would be Travis.  Right.  She's well under five foot.  Can't weigh more than 60 pounds.  She's dressed up in a, like a, what, a leotard or some kind of like.  Yeah, some kind of a little.  Almost like a ballerina type thing.  Outfit a girl would wear it for a recital.  Sure.  It taps all over.  And she's.  Oh, look at the knees.  She's attempting to dance and she's got an umbrella that she's twirling. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, she's got some moves.  Oh, man.  She's got some moves.  All right.  This kid boogies.  I like it.  That is frightening.  She's doing the thriller dance by accident.  Their hands all out like the zombies.  Looks like she crawled out of the grave, too.  Oh, my God.  Who does she look like?  That DNA is a bitch, man.  My God.  Oh, my God.  Stop with a close-up.  This is a close-up.  What do you got, Danny?  And she wears silly hats.  Somebody posted this as a comment on my MySpace.  And the background music was like this really hard thrash metal.  It just made the video. 
[01:34:00]  Really?  That's so much funnier.  She looks like David Bowie.  So it's more of a visual.  Hopefully, the censors won't kill us, and they'll link this to onaradio.com later today.  We'll see.  Why would they kill us?  Who knows, Jimmy?  Who knows?  I don't know what that is.  It's funny.  Her head is the only normal part of her, and she's distracting from that by wearing a clown  head on top of hers.  It's like you ought to showcase your head and put a halo around it.  What's wrong with her, though?  Can we find out?  Let's get her on the phone.  How about everything? 
[01:34:30]  She's got some kind of muscular dystrophy, it looks like.  Here we are.  I'm making fun of her.  Well, polio?  What's polio?  What the hell year is it?  They don't get polio anymore.  They got polio?  This is polio.  What, Steve?  It's fake.  Huh?  Steve is saying it's fake.  Is it fake, Steve?  No.  No.  Okay.  Quick story, and then we got your speeches from last night.  We'll go back to the political thing here.  But first, this cute little story. 
[01:35:00]  A boy in Mexico tried to skip school and got into a sticky situation, literally.  This 10-year-old snuck into the kitchen of his family's home early Monday, got industrial  glue, slathered it on his right hand, and then grabbed the frame of his bed.  When the boy's mother woke up, she found him in his room watching TV with his hand on the  bed.  At first, she didn't think anything of it, but when she realized he was stuck, she spent  nearly two hours trying to get his hand free with water, oil, and nail polish remover. 
[01:35:30]  Eventually, a team of paramedics were called in.  The boy says he pulled the stunt because he had so much fun on Christmas break, he didn't  want to go back.  But it didn't work.  He was unglued in time for class.  The boy's hand is fine, and his mother describes her son as a good kid, but says he's mischievous  like all kids.  Let me tell you what my mom would have done.  She would have made me go to school with the mattress.  With the bed.  No joke.  She wouldn't have attempted to even get my hand free. 
[01:36:00]  Didn't take that kind of guff in the Hughes house.  No, she would have said, you're going to school, stupid.  And then she would have hauled me and the mattress in the Volkswagen bus without the seat so we  could fit more kids in there, and she would have hauled me to school.  She's not going to put up with that crap.  She never did.  Good thing he's not Saudi Arabian.  They would have thought he was stealing the mattress and just cut his hand off.  Yeah.  Left it there.  I never got off from school like that. 
[01:36:30]  But I used to say I had a stomach ache all the time because I was always, you know, nervous,  crying.  And one time I did have a stomach ache, and I got sent to a school, and I told the gym  teacher I had cramps because, like, I was...  Like lady cramps?  No, no.  No, see, I thought that gas pains, like, I was cramping up.  Yeah.  And for some reason, my stupid mom would say, oh, what's the matter?  You have cramps? 
[01:37:00]  And I was like, yeah, yeah.  Like, I grew up thinking, like, gas pains were called cramps.  So I told my gym teacher, who, you know, gym teachers in school are always very sympathetic.  I said, I don't feel good today.  I have cramps.  And he looked at me.  He goes, what are you talking about?  Only women get cramps.  What are you, a woman?  And I'm just standing there like I'm a kid with a tummy ache, and I'm being lambasted that  I'm a woman.  You just never got a break growing up.  Never. 
[01:37:30]  You know, there's a story, it's local, but they were digging up some backyard in East  Islip last night or yesterday, searching for a dead body.  Yeah.  Supposedly a murder that possibly happened 25, 30 years ago.  Is it someone Boomer Esiason beat up?  Right.  And the whole time I'm thinking, I have a feeling that the Kumeyes have something to do with  this story.  We're involved in that one?  Let me think.  Did we kill anyone in East Islip?  It sounded like it was your neighborhood that you've described over the years. 
[01:38:00]  I lived on Timber Point Road in East Islip.  Timber Point.  So if it wasn't Timber Point or a place around there, I don't think it was us.  Maybe one of the faithful could find out how close Anthony lived to this situation that's  going on out there in East Islip.  Hey, by the way, getting a request.  Kid with the glue, the hand, and the bed?  Yeah.  Bleep game.  Wow.  Bleep game.  Yeah, you could probably do the bleep game with that story.  Let's try bleep game with that as we play some audio from New Hampshire. 
[01:38:30]  Yes, the big primary.  Is this a caucus or a primary?  This was a primary.  What's the difference between a caucus and a primary?  I don't know.  Well, caucus is normally a lead up to a primary.  There he goes.  Oh, boy.  But no, no, no, no, no, no.  But no, no, no, no, no.  If you're going to win the caucus, they say the primary will look good, but it's not a  guarantee.  We're getting info about Goddess Bunny. 
[01:39:00]  By the way, you had a line about a big wheel or something.  Everyone's saying it was hilarious, and you got no reaction.  Did I?  I didn't hear it from Jimmy or I.  I never remember what I say until the replay.  It's too late.  It was on instant feedback about 10 minutes.  What did he say?  I don't know.  That's why I'm asking.  But Chad in Oregon, what do you got?  Yeah, you guys were talking about the Goddess Bunny.  It's actually not a female.  It's a male.  I was right.  It's a tranny on top of it?  Uh-oh.  It's a tranny.  So Jimmy should be proud. 
[01:39:30]  But what went wrong?  I have no idea, but I saw it about six months ago, and I did some research, and it's some  sort of guy who's actually some sort of internet star or who knows what he does.  All right, well...  Actually, he's tranny, and then he's 20 or so.  We got info on the Goddess Bunny.  Jimmy, what do you got on the Goddess Bunny?  Well, the Goddess Bunny, also known as Little Johnny Bama, stricken with polio birth, apparently  was abused as a youth in foster homes.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, dry spaghetti legs. 
[01:40:00]  He was defiant enough to transform into a campy, wisecracking Sandy Crisp, a celebrated singer,  dancer, actress, and model.  After a starring role in a startling cult film, Miss Crisp was playfully dubbed the Goddess  Bunny, and soon became an object of wild, fetishistic worship by the denzines of West 
[01:40:30]  Coast culture, counterculture.  Hear the Goddess recount her own astounding story, and join her colorful group of friends  and fans, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I would love to hear her talk, or her talk.  It talk.  Yeah.  Well, how about we get this thing on our show?  I would love to interview the Goddess Bunny.  Yeah, let's try to get the Goddess Bunny on our show.  By the way, we got emails from this, I don't know if it was a transvestite or a transsexual  who does a variety show, and we never had her on.  I don't remember.  We should have.  I like to, you know, forget about that type of thing. 
[01:41:00]  Why?  It exists, and it's fun for a lot of us.  I mean, people.  Hedda Lettuce.  We should have, you know?  Hedda Lettuce?  I don't think that's her real name.  All right.  Hedda Lettuce.  Thank goodness.  Let's go back to New Hampshire.  We talked a lot about what happened earlier in the show, and now we got some talking.  I'm just sorry.  Some audio.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  People with polio should not tap dance.  It just doesn't work.  Let me correct you. 
[01:41:30]  People with polio should only tap dance.  That is horrid.  The music is great, but you got to see the visual.  That is a great call.  Is that your idea?  Oh, look at the kneecaps and the...  Oh, my God.  That does look like jam gum, but skinnier.  What?  Yeah.  I feed me. 
[01:42:00]  He has a normal-sized head.  The beauty of this little wacko is that he has a normal-sized head on just an awful small polio body.  And this isn't nice.  A bunch of people saying the goddess bunny is Neo with a wig.  Oh, yes.  That's way too inside for most people.  Neo is a listener.  But a few people are getting a big chuckle there.  Who is kind of like polio guy, but shorter and with a worse body.  All right.  Let's go to New Hampshire.  Enough about the goddess bunny. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  We'll link that hopefully later to onaradio.com.  All right.  You got McCain.  He won for the Republicans, and this is what he had to say.  First, I'd like to thank my wife, Cindy, and my seven children, and all of our campaign team who did such a wonderful job, and I'm very grateful.  My friends, you know, I'm past the age when I can claim the noun kid, no matter what adjective precedes it.  But tonight, we sure showed him what a comeback looks like. 
[01:43:00]  I could say this much.  He just scares me.  I don't know why.  I don't know what it is.  More than Obama?  I can't.  Yeah.  I can't put my finger on it, but he just scares me.  He's the next president.  He's a hero.  He's an American hero.  But there's just something that just doesn't seem right.  I think you're right.  I think he will be the next president of these United States. 
[01:43:30]  John McCain.  Is he like a moderate Republican?  He's not a complete loon.  Yeah, yeah.  He's kind of moderate.  I like him because he fucking...  Did he?  Who?  Who?  When?  Who and where?  Seven times, apparently.  Jimmy.  I like him because he forgave Imus.  He goes, oh, he said he was sorry.  I'll go back on his show.  That's, to me, the way everybody should have reacted.  Right.  Yep.  Yep.  All right.  McCain continued.  Vacuum!  Vacuum!  Vacuum!  Vacuum!  Thank you.  When the pundits declared us finished, I told them, I'm going to New Hampshire where 
[01:44:00]  the voters don't let you make their decision for them.  And when they asked, how are you going to do it?  You're down in the polls.  You don't have the money.  I answered, I'm going to New Hampshire and I'm going to tell people the truth.  I don't think he actually answered like that.  No.  No.  He probably went, I don't know. 
[01:44:30]  How are we going to do it?  I found a writer to kind of pump it up a little bit.  Yeah.  No one talks politically like that in their personal life, do they?  I hope not.  What are you going to do, John?  You're getting killed.  You got no money.  I'm going to tell the truth.  This is me you're talking to.  What?  Yeah.  Stop it.  I'm not a no.  What are you going to do?  And I don't know.  I lose Hillary with the big victory.  Everyone said that, you know, she was done and she beat Obama last night.  Yep.  39 to 36, something like that.  Was it?  39 to 37, I believe.  37.  They expected a big blowout though. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, it was close.  But yeah.  They said Hillary was done.  Right.  Obama's running away with it.  And then all of a sudden, eh, maybe we were wrong.  Punch it up.  You're right, Kevin.  So here's Hillary.  The new Hillary.  I come tonight with a very, very full heart.  And the calves.  Oh, God.  I want especially to thank New Hampshire over the last week. 
[01:45:30]  I listened to you.  And in the process, I found my own voice.  She's a totally new person.  Yeah.  Which shows you what a phony she has been all.  Who just changes diction as fast as she does?  Yeah.  She just changes inflection.  Found my own voice.  Someone finally told her, stop with the act, act, act, act, act speech pattern.  She's going to speak in tongues next. 
[01:46:00]  She's just going to start babbling.  She's like De Niro at the end of Cape Fear.  And she's making her concession speech.  Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little, hey, little.  That movie should have got way more props than it did.  He's trying to offer me something hot.  Yeah.  He was great in that movie.  He really was.  I know it did well.  But it just seems like it should have been more of a classic than it became.  More Hillary.  I felt like we all spoke from our hearts, and I am so gratified that you responded. 
[01:46:30]  Now, together, let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me.  She's feeling good.  This phony.  She's feeling good.  She has just changed everything about her public speech.  Yeah.  Well, at least we know we were right. 
[01:47:00]  She's a complete fraud.  Yeah, fake.  A phony.  Can we put a montage together of all the different voices of Hillary?  Oh, the southern one.  The black one.  The robot one.  That's a great idea.  Yeah, that is.  The sensitive one.  See how phony she is.  We probably could find another one or two there.  Did we hear Reagan doing that?  You heard Reagan talking pretty much the same.  Yeah.  You know.  He is.  Except at the end.  I'm a suitcase.  Are you?  Maybe you should go back up to bed there, Ron. 
[01:47:30]  Poor guy.  Hey, we got to go for everyone around.  How to deal with that.  Head's got rice pudding in it.  Oscar from Jersey has something.  Oscar.  Hey, boys.  I was going to talk about McCain, but real quick.  Clinton just hired Paul Begali as her, you know, chief strategist guy.  And he's the guy that gets paid, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars and tells her  what to say.  Oh, wait. 
[01:48:00]  Is he the...  Because she did fire her guy over something, right?  He said something stupid?  No, that was...  That was somebody else the other day.  Yeah, with the Obama thing.  Oh, yeah, but Begali was the guy that used to be on, like, Crossfire with James Carville  and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, he's a hardcore liberal, but the dude's good at his job, man, and they hired  him, and now look what happened.  They must have just told him, look, you're not connecting with anybody.  You sound phony.  You're not sincere. 
[01:48:30]  People's image of you is this cold, icy bitch who's just very self-serving, wants  to be president for her own reasons, not for the country.  That's the image she was putting out there.  And now there's this sensitive Hillary who's talking to America and talking about how she  wants to make it a better place for everybody.  Soft-spoken.  She gets a little teary-eyed every so often when she thinks about the opportunities this 
[01:49:00]  country has given her and everyone else.  Where the hell did this Hillary come from?  She's a white lady of privilege.  When wouldn't you have had opportunities?  Yeah.  Stop.  Hey, but boys, the thing about McCain is, you remember a couple months ago he came out  against, you know, the CIA had those reports about the water torture and stuff, and McCain  came out and said, you can't do that.  Well, the guy would be a little hypocritical saying that he was for torture.  You know, the guy spent a little while in a Hanoi Hilton over there getting his ass beat 
[01:49:30]  every day.  I think that might change your opinion.  I was in a tiger cage for a couple years.  Cry me a rat.  Rats!  Rats!  Michael!  Michael!  Rats!  But yeah, you're right.  We came with the POW, man.  Yeah.  Guy was beaten to a pulp.  That's what he looks like he does, and he can't move right, and his arms are a little  screwy.  They broke like every bone in his body.  Kind of crazy.  Oscar, that was your cue there. 
[01:50:00]  Hey, I didn't want to hear the old, okay, now you talk time.  Oh, okay.  Now, why would you talk when we are silent waiting for you to talk?  Yeah, exactly.  You got to just sit there.  Let it all happen.  Yeah.  Let it all happen.  Leave it to us.  It's not life.  It's a dress rehearsal.  Just watch it on the sidelines.  All right.  Thank you, Oscar.  We got to go to Peter.  Peter, what's up?  You can't win.  Hey, guys.  I was going to say, if you go to the end of Hillary's speech, you get the...  There was a little arc. 
[01:50:30]  What was there?  The one we just played?  Where's the clipped...  Where's that clipped stuff that she's so good at?  Thank you, sir.  And then, of course, you got Obama.  Do you know that whenever she talks like that, a big C, she just materialized over her  head.  Face, she'd grow hair around it.  Are you guys following this race a little closer than past elections? 
[01:51:00]  Especially this early, in the primaries, yeah.  It seems like a lot of people are.  It seems like, what, more people are interested in the process here.  It's because...  You got the black president possibility.  You got a black guy and a woman.  You got the John McCain factor.  It's kind of interesting.  That's what it is.  And it's interesting that they bring up constantly the fact that Hillary is a woman, you know,  with her being a little misty-eyed and, you know, showing... 
[01:51:30]  And the women jumping on board, sympathizing with another woman.  But they don't really bring up the fact that Obama's black.  And, you know, use that as a reason why people are voting for him.  The only writers I've seen do it are black writers.  They'll write about him and talk about how white America is really rallying behind this  guy because he comes off as this non-threatening black guy who's well-spoken.  It's all the same cliches that everybody always looks at in a black man when you see them as 
[01:52:00]  non-threatening.  Oh, he's well-spoken, well-dressed, educated, you know, and that kind of stereotype is fine.  Well, I mean, let's be honest.  Someone running for president, you kind of hope they're well-spoken.  Well, not in the movies.  They're not like that in the movies.  When you go to a wacky movie where a black guy gets to be president or somebody, you know,  they talk all jive and stuff, or I brought this up before, I watch the History Channel 
[01:52:30]  and Discovery and all that, and you see a lot of shows.  I love shows on fighter planes and pilots, and they have interviews with fighter pilots,  white guys, black guys, and you'll have a black guy, fighter pilot, talking, and he  sounds amazing, talking very technical about the plane and their mission and everything, 
[01:53:00]  but then you watch the movies and they're like, well, I'm going to tear this plane up,  yo, take that.  They're like, I've never seen a black fighter pilot talk like that in any interview I've seen  on a TV show on Discovery or the History Channel or anything, but they got to go, oh, yeah,  that missile, I'm going to send this missile to your mama's ass.  Are you?  Yeah, it's so true.  I've never heard that over the tapes that they played during combat. 
[01:53:30]  All right, well, listen, when we get back, we'll give you what Obama had to say about  his second place showing.  We got the bleep game with the kid story we just played.  What?  Two versions.  Two versions.  One Sam wins me.  Oh, competition.  I love it.  All right, we got a little competition happening, and we're also going to play What Did We Learn  on the Opie and Anthony Show, and Tim came up with a bunch more of a bunch more slogans  because we're looking possibly for a new slogan for the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:54:00]  Jimmy came up with a great one yesterday.  That's right.  What is it again, Jimmy?  Opie and Anthony.  Get your hat.  Get your hat.  And now it's like game on because people are sending in their slogans, and Tim's making  slogans, so hopefully we can play a few of the new ones.  It kind of goes along with the election, too, because a good slogan really kind of sells you.  Sure.  So we're thinking maybe that'll help us even more here.  All right.  When we come back, we'll do a lot of mopping up here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, thanks for listening this morning. 
[01:54:30]  Opie and Anthony on your radio doll.  Pretty good doll.  Did pretty good in the ratings yesterday.  I want to thank you all.  I want to thank you all.  Thank you, New York.  Had a nice showing, and we appreciate that.  Eric B. from New Hampshire, on the Instant Feedback, he writes,  You keep talking about those wacky movies.  Have there really been any ones other than the Chris Rock one?  How many black president movies are there?  I don't mean black president movies. 
[01:55:00]  They can be black, like, I don't know, appointees or, you know, secretary of defense.  All of a sudden he gets in there somehow.  I don't know.  And is that the only one?  The Chris Rock wacky movie?  No, there was a name, Murphy one, where his name is the same thing.  Mr. What?  Mr.  The Distinguished Gentleman.  Thank you.  Well, Deep Impact has Morgan Freeman, but he's not, you know, he's not jiving it up in there. 
[01:55:30]  No, but the effect in Deep Impact is actually worse than if we had a real one.  Oh, wait.  No, it's supposed to make you better.  I just said the truth.  You're a good man.  Hey, there you go.  That's right.  That's your liberal.  Yeah.  The liberal in you coming out.  Hold on.  What's again?  I was supposed to say is the effect would be worse than the...  Can I have a shot of talent, please?  Tom in Buffalo checking in.  Tom.  Yo, what's up, O&A? 
[01:56:00]  Where has Buffalo been?  We haven't heard from you guys in a while.  I've always been here listening every morning.  Hey, are you guys getting, like, the warm weather?  Oh, it's warm, but windy out here.  Windy real bad.  That wind's coming our way, see?  Yeah.  You checked Buffalo for our weather.  That means we're going to have some windy days.  That's right.  I was going to tightrope it between two tall buildings, but I'll have to wait.  You'll have to wait until spring, I think, Jimmy.  That's right.  Yeah.  What do you got, Tom?  I was just making a comment on how, like, basically the presidential election now is  a big reality TV show. 
[01:56:30]  They might as well throw these guys in a house with cameras and have the public vote on them  because the reality shows get better voter turnout than the election does.  And they're taking a page from all these reality shows.  They're making it interesting enough for us to actually start paying attention to them.  So, I don't know.  I'm watching more than I usually do, and I hate this stuff.  I really do.  I'm just from the school that nothing really ever changes.  Yeah.  Well, if you wanted one man to do a lot of change, you had to live, like, a long time ago. 
[01:57:00]  I don't know.  You had to live a long time ago.  If a woman or a black man got elected president, you would see some changes.  That's all.  Not as many as you think.  No, I don't think as many as you think either.  Neither one of them is going to be more liberal than Jimmy Carter.  I mean, there might be some, but...  That's tragic.  But you know what I'm saying.  It's like, they're not...  What are they going to do that's so different?  The way that they handle foreign policy. 
[01:57:30]  No!  I think.  Maybe.  The way that they deal with certain issues around the country with, well, sexism with Hillary,  racism with Obama.  These are personal issues to them that I think they would take into the presidency with them.  Yeah.  It's my opinion.  Um...  Oh, the, uh, the race war? 
[01:58:00]  I went to an awful site last night.  Website.  Oh, my God.  Did you really, Anthony?  Wow, what a big surprise there.  There's your homepage.  No, you just put a couple of search words in Yahoo.  One is Obama.  And then you put in a real bad search word with that.  And the, um...  Wow.  A couple of things pop up, and there's a couple of message boards. 
[01:58:30]  And there are people that honestly, uh, hope he does get elected because they think that  if something bad happens to him when he's in office, that it will start the race war  that they're all waiting for, to reclaim the country for the white man.  That seems to be, uh, what was posted on there, you know, after I post it.  But, no, it was, I was just reading.  So you had a lot of, uh, replies to your initial post. 
[01:59:00]  Well, no, I didn't post on that board at all.  I don't post on that one.  But I've been to some other, uh, websites that, um, you would think wouldn't be very  sympathetic to Obama's cause to be a president of the United States.  And, um, yeah, they've got some interesting, uh, takes on this whole election.  I gotta tell you.  Ones that aren't really covered by the media.  I was talking to someone from, uh, Philly last night.  That I'm making officially part of the Philly crew.  Oh, okay. 
[01:59:30]  I'm adding members all the time.  Oh.  And, uh, this person, a she, enjoying the show a hell of a lot lately.  Because she loves hearing how insane you have become.  All right.  With your politics.  I like that.  And your theories and.  People think it's insane.  I like.  Just loving the hell out of what's, what you're talking about lately.  In the long run, people will go, oh my God, Anthony, were you right? 
[02:00:00]  And I would say, yes.  So get me out of here.  Help.  Uh, Brian of Philly, who's not part of the Philly crew.  I'm sorry, Brian, but I don't know anything about you.  What's up, Brian?  Good morning, boys.  How are you today?  Hey.  Hi, man.  Has anybody forgotten how much Hillary was hated back when Bill Clinton was president?  Yes.  Talking about how she has flip-flopped and changed.  Does anyone remember when all of a sudden she was Hillary Rodham Clinton?  Yeah, what happened to the Rodham?  I'll tell you what happened to the Rodham. 
[02:00:30]  Someone sat her down and said, stop with the stupid speech thing you're doing.  And then drop that dumb Rodham thing.  Drop the Rodham.  Because it makes you sound privileged.  They want to think that you're a person like them.  So you just go with Hillary Clinton.  Yeah.  Exactly.  She was a total joke then.  She's a joke now.  Rodham just gave too much attitude.  Hillary Rodham.  Rod Ham.  Rod and his ham legs.  Stop trying to keep your identity.  Either Rodham or Clinton.  Make a decision.  Yeah.  Make a decision, shawarma calves. 
[02:01:00]  You know what?  I had to make a decision back in the day when I first started in broadcasting.  Is it going to be Greg Hughes or Opie?  But it cannot be Greg Opie Hughes anymore.  No.  Only in the paper.  Only in the paper.  It's Greg Opie Hughes.  And the Opie's got to be in, you know, the quotation marks.  Program director at the time, Stan Main from Rochester.  He goes, look, dude, you're known as Opie.  You're stuck with that name since you were, what, 11, 12 years old.  But to do your radio show and call yourself Greg Opie Hughes is just ridiculous. 
[02:01:30]  Were you really doing that?  Yeah.  And he goes, Greg Opie Hughes with you.  I can find tapes.  I'm bringing my tapes.  And I really am.  I'm finally going to unload my boxes.  I'm finally officially moving into my place, even though I've been living there.  But, you know, finally unloading the boxes.  Because I'll find the old tapes.  But, and he also said Greg Hughes would be a fine radio name.  So you've got to, you know, decide.  What'd you do?  So, at is it end?  All right.  Here's what Obama had to say last night.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:02:00]  Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Senator Clinton on a hard-fought victory here  in New Hampshire.  She did an outstanding job.  Give her a big round of applause.  Wow.  That's humble.  You think that's smart?  I think it's smart.  Yeah, why not?  Very smart.  Most of the time they don't.  They'll say, you know, they'll thank their opponents or something.  They won't get too personal with the...  Yeah, the name and everything.  Give her a hand.  This guy's got balls.  He's got confidence, this guy.  I don't like his voice.  This one's got the confidence. 
[02:02:30]  You know, a few weeks ago, no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here  tonight in New Hampshire.  No one could have imagined it.  A movie?  He was supposed to get his ass kicked.  After this campaign, we were far behind.  We always knew our climb would be steep. 
[02:03:00]  But in record numbers, you came out and you spoke up for change.  And with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election,  there is something happening in America.  There certainly is.  There certainly is.  We're going to have some fun with this.  Anthony is getting all revved up. 
[02:03:30]  Well, I don't know.  Hey, we only got a few minutes.  Something about when he says change, I get all flustered.  Because it's not the change you're looking for.  That's the problem.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know what kind of change it is.  There's change going on.  Not the change you want, though.  Hey, we only got a couple minutes on.  On this side of the Opie and Anthony show.  So let's play the bleep game.  Do you guys remember the little story we did a few minutes ago?  The cutest hand that stuck with glue, right?  Hopefully you linger longer enough to, you know.  To go. 
[02:04:00]  To still be in this bit.  But basically, it was a kid.  He didn't want to go to school.  He enjoyed the Christmas holiday.  So he figured, all right, I'll glue my hand with industrial glue to, what, my bed?  Yeah, my bed.  Bed frame.  Bed frame.  And he was stuck like that.  So he almost didn't go to school.  But the mom figured out how to get his hand free and kicked his ass out the door.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, so we took that news story, and we played the bleep game, and we got two versions.  Which version is this?  That's mine.  Okay, so we start with Danny's then.  That's mine.  So Danny came up with this. 
[02:04:30]  These guys decided to do a little competition really fast here.  Mm-hmm.  So this is Danny's version of the bleep game of that story I just described.  A boy in Mexico trying to skip school and got into a sticky situation, literally.  This 10-year-old snuck into the kitchen of his family's home early Monday, got industrial glue,  slathered it on his ****, then **** the frame of his bed.  When the boy's mother woke up, she found him in his room watching TV with his **** on the bed.  At first, she didn't think anything of it. 
[02:05:00]  But when she realized he was stuck, she spent nearly two hours trying to get his **** free with water, oil, and nail polish remover.  Eventually, a team of paramedics were called in.  The boy says he **** the **** because he had so much fun on Christmas break, he didn't want to go back.  But it didn't work.  He was unglued in time for class.  The boy's **** fine, and his mother describes her son as a good kid, but says he's mischievous like all kids.  That's awesome.  That's a good one. 
[02:05:30]  That's a great one.  That's a good one.  See, I didn't like that because it's a story about his hand, but that makes it sound dirty.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  It did.  I didn't even think of that.  Aw, Sam, how are you going to beat that?  He put all the bleeps in the right places, so what did you do differently?  Yeah, what did you do different?  It's going to be the same thing.  You did?  I invented the beep game.  Oh, crazy.  Some people say Jimmy Kimmel did.  Yeah.  We have to deal with that every time we play the beep, the bleep game.  That's arguable, I think.  Radio guys have been doing this for a very long time. 
[02:06:00]  Calm down.  Not to take away from Jimmy Kimmel.  He's made it pretty popular with his fine late night show, but this type of thing has  been around a long time.  And Jimmy comes from our world, the radio world.  All right.  We'll see what you did with the same story.  This is Sam's version.  A boy in Mexico tried to skip school and got into a sticky situation, literally.  This 10-year-old snuck into the kitchen of his family's home early Monday, got industrial 
[02:06:30]  glue, slathered it on his right hand, and then grabbed the beep of his beep.  When the boy's mother woke up, she found him in his room watching TV with his hand on the  beep.  At first, she didn't think anything of it, but when she realized he was stuck, she spent  nearly two hours trying to get his hand free with water, oil, and nail polish remover.  The boy says he pulled the beep because he had so much fun on Christmas break, he didn't  want to go back.  But it didn't work.  He was unglued in time for class. 
[02:07:00]  The boy's beep is fine, and his mother describes her son as a good kid, but says he's mischievous  like all kids.  I've got to give you guys props.  I was thinking, wait.  It's a little different, yeah.  There's two versions of this.  How could it possibly be different?  But Sam just showed you.  Another way to do it.  Very good, Sam.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Your eyebrows give me the creeps.  Why?  Do they?  They look like dress socks.  Are you voting for Obama? 
[02:07:30]  I don't know yet.  You don't know?  That isn't a definite no?  Well, I don't know.  We still got a lot of time.  Holy mother of God, he's going to win.  I might feel like he's the right man for the job.  Oh, boy.  I'm happy you will.  The right man for the job.  Hey, what's the first thing you're going to do when we get a black president?  Book passage.  Book passage.  Book passage. 
[02:08:00]  What is this, 1820?  Um, I don't know.  Let's see.  If I wake up, day after the election, they've tabulated everything.  I wake up, I go to the website, I pull up something like Drudge, and I see, um, oh, God, I can't even say it.  I, uh, I see.  President.  Hmm.  What would I do? 
[02:08:30]  If I refresh Drudge and make sure that was the actual site, that'd be fair to see.  I wouldn't.  What was under the bleep there?  I don't know.  You had your own words.  All right.  Let me hear it again.  President.  Yep.  It begins with an N.  Are you insane?  New president.  Oh.  What?  There'd be a new president.  Why would you have to bleep new?  That day.  Why would you have to bleep new?  Mistake. 
[02:09:00]  Because some people thought I was saying Jew.  Ah.  And they would think that there was a different, uh, president.  Giuliani?  Giuliani.  Let's, uh, let's, uh.  I would have to, um, wait it out until after the inauguration to see what happens.  I'd give him, uh, I'd give him some time.  What?  A day?  A week.  A week, right?  I'd give him some time to see who he starts appointing. 
[02:09:30]  It takes a week to get rid of the hangover.  You gotta get more than a week.  What?  I'd stay drunk.  You certainly will.  So some things aren't changing.  Hey, let's say hi to Jesse.  Uh, Jesse, what did you learn on the Opiate Anthony show?  I learned that, uh, Anthony's imminent liver failure started with one can of Coors.  Yes.  I had to stay on a bowl for eight seconds for that Coors, by the way.  Huh?  I had to stay on a bowl.  Oh, that's right.  For eight seconds.  Um, and I stayed on for like two seconds, but Dad gave me the beer anyway. 
[02:10:00]  Your dad was insane.  It certainly was.  All right.  Well, I had fun.  Yes.  It was a good one.  It flew by today.  All right.  We're going to go to XM.  Yeah, we go over there now.  That's what we do.  And you guys do what you do.  That's what we do.  You guys do what you do.  We do it what we do.  Maybe we're doing the same thing.  I don't know.  That's how we end today. 
[02:10:30]  See you all on the COD tonight.  All right, Dan.  Call of Duty.  Call of Duty 4.  Of course.  Of course.  And, uh, once again, New York, thank you.  We did very well in the ratings yesterday, and we appreciate that.  It's, uh, Opie and Anthony.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  Oh, I think I saw Boone.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  God damn.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:12:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:12:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:13:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:14:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:14:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  She's a total phony.  I don't hate her because she's a liberal.  I hate her because I think she's a fucking, she's the wife of a brilliant, brilliant guy.  She's also very, very bright.  But I just think she's an absolute fucking phony.  You know what?  At least with that guy, who's the other psychopath, Duncan?  Yes, Duncan Hunter. 
[02:16:00]  Yes, Duncan Hunter.  Duncan Hunter.  At least he takes definite stands, as awful as they are.  He's at least taking very definite stands.  You do have to respect that.  So did Hitler.  I always do.  No, you've got to respect the person that's not scared to say what they believe in.  Absolutely.  Like, you know, when we talk about how much we're into the death penalty, we're turning  some people off.  But, you know, at least we're telling people what we're all about instead of being wishy-washy.  There's radio guys that are wishy-washy because they're trying to get everybody out there  to like them.  Mm-hmm.  That's just dumb.  Well, politicians do that, too. 
[02:16:30]  Right.  Well, that's what they...  All the time.  Hey, who do you...  Who do you dislike more, Anthony?  Okay, let me think.  Hillary or Obama?  Because I...  Dislike?  Who bothers you more?  I have to say Hillary.  Really?  Yeah.  She bothers me more.  I dislike her more.  Because she...  I'm not sure if Obama's phony yet.  He seems sincere.  Um, whatever, you know, his ideas are, I don't really know. 
[02:17:00]  But, uh, Hillary's just a phony.  She just comes across as a phony who's doing this just for her own little power base and  her own satisfaction, her own goals in life.  She's always wanted to do this, and, eh, she...  I don't think she cares about the people, her constituency, and if she ever did become  president, uh, it wouldn't be because she cares so much about America. 
[02:17:30]  That's all a line of shit.  It's all about, uh, how far she can go in the career.  And when you're a politician, the pinnacle is to be president of the United States.  That's what she wants to do.  You think she did, uh, a good job as being senator?  No, I think she's just been, um...  I wouldn't know.  She's taking on the easy battles.  Uh, you know, it's easy to go to, uh, Washington and say, hey, our state asked for more money  after 9-11. 
[02:18:00]  You know?  You're not really gonna get a fight from your, uh, people you're representing.  Say, no, we don't want more money.  Mm-hmm.  You know, she's always going to Washington looking for more money.  That's, that's great.  Uh, never taking on the real tough issues, though.  You know what I learned from the New York City documentary that I've been bringing up  a lot lately?  Ooh.  Uh, and make fun of, obviously, because it was so goddamn long.  Uh, but politicians back in the day, they, they did go for the tough things.  They did go for, we need to build the Erie Canal. 
[02:18:30]  And people are like, what the fuck are you talking about?  And we're building the Hoover Dam.  Right.  Which will take, uh, years and millions of dollars in concrete, and we're gonna carve  out of a valley.  Right, right.  Like, wow, that was some big shit.  But that's what I'm getting at.  You don't, you don't hear about those massive what-the-fuck type of projects anymore, because  it's, it's just too much.  Too many people in the mix.  Too much red tape, too much. 
[02:19:00]  Environmentalists fighting with the.  Too many people are gonna piss off.  Like, there was a day that they had to carve out new highways and just completely take  away neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Like, not just a few houses, like neighborhoods that generations of people lived in.  But they didn't care.  They knew in the long run, this is what we needed to do.  And you don't, you just don't see that anymore with, uh, politicians.  Uh, going for the big thing.  Yeah.  The big project.  Like, look, dude, we need, like, for us here in New York, it's so obvious that the  Long Island Expressway is a complete disaster.  But no one's gonna take on that project and go, all right, we, this is what we gotta do. 
[02:19:30]  And it's gonna, it's gonna be a pain in the ass for the next eight years or what, or what  have you.  But we have to do this.  No one is willing to, to do that in politics anymore.  So, like you said, uh, they just go for the easy stuff.  Yeah, easy stuff.  The real easy stuff.  That it's, uh, write a bill, change this a little bit, change that a little bit.  Just bitch about stuff.  Usually nothing gets done.  They just bitch about things.  We always bring up the video game issue.  But that pops up so much with politicians that, uh, they need this and that. 
[02:20:00]  And it's like, they would love to take your Call of Duty 4 away from you.  I'm telling you right now, wait for the first, uh, wait for the next school shooting.  And now because Call of Duty 4 is a hot game, that's the one they're gonna pop on the TV.  I hear they were banning some people from Call of Duty 4 for a while, or at least suspending  them for a while, because their, um, their, uh, clan name, that is before your name, you  know, uh, was insulting.  Some of them were insulting.  If they're derogatory, uh, then they might suspend you. 
[02:20:30]  Yet, the entire game is running around and blowing people up, shooting them, stabbing them.  Yeah.  But, uh, which I think is fine.  Believe me, I love the game.  But, just that hypocrisy that someone's gonna get their feelings hurt by, uh, uh, a few  letters in front of your name is ridiculous.  We're just, we're language-obsessed fucking frauds, Americans.  Language-obsessed frauds.  Yeah, yeah.  It all has to do with what, what words are, are, are offensive, and, and actions, and actual 
[02:21:00]  things of substance don't really matter as much as just people saying stuff.  Uh, Justin in Philly.  Justin.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  How you doing?  I just wanted to point out, uh, the Big Dig is a fairly ambitious recent project, and,  uh, your boy Janino was involved in it.  Well, first of all, first of all, it's not that recent.  That thing started, how many years ago?  I did something from Boston. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, man, you're right.  I mean, they're...  Dukakis.  I think it was Dukakis was, uh...  Dukakis left...  When did Dukakis leave office?  87, I think?  Yeah.  Uh, but you're right, the Big Dig is like, that's what they used to do back in the day,  these just massive projects they would take on to really improve the, uh, the quality  of life for a city, or, or, or a town, or, or a neighborhood, or what have you.  And that Big Dig went great.  Oops. 
[02:22:00]  He's listening to himself.  Uh, it's too bad, because I want to talk to Justin a little more, but, uh, that's all  you get today.  Yeah, the Big Dig is one of those big projects.  Big Dig is big.  Sure.  Big.  Uh, Brian in Rochester, the home of Brother Weez, who's, uh, off the air, by the way.  What the hell is that about?  I think he's in...  I think there's a little negotiation...  Oh, God.  Who gives a shit about Brother Weez, right, you asshole?  Keep fucking talking.  He will continue to fucking talk, because he's...  He doesn't understand what the hell's going on today.  Hold on, let's start over. 
[02:22:30]  Holy shit, Brian.  Go ahead, Brian.  What were you saying?  Yeah, uh, Robert Moses took on...  Ah, you're boring me.  ...and basically...  I don't really care what you're saying.  You see how this hurts?  New York City?  Yeah, yeah.  Think about, think about all the, all the bridges and the highways.  Robert Moses basically transformed New York City from being just a, uh, uh, you know,  subway, uh, taken kind of crowd to people going out to the suburbs and coming back into  New York City, all those roadways and bridges, you know, he... 
[02:23:00]  You heard about, you heard about that, didn't you?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Why does a guy talk over everybody?  Just hang up on him.  Brian!  I would like to just talk, uh, about Robert Moses.  Brian.  Yeah?  Why won't you listen to us?  I'm sorry, bro.  I'm, I'm driving, and I got, like, a state trooper behind me, and I'm hoping he's...  I hope he gets pulled over and shot.  I know.  I hope he goes to reach for his license, and he forgets that it's his gun, and he just takes  a fucking bullet in the cheek.  Yeah, Robert Moses was, uh, an interesting character.  Did you hear that rumor? 
[02:23:30]  I don't know if it's rumor, urban legend...  They didn't touch on it.  ...about the bridges.  During the documentary, they didn't touch on it, man.  They, uh, they put, uh, Robert Moses, um, put the parkways on Long Island.  He did.  He built most of the bridges in the New York area.  Yeah, how nice!  Yeah, he, uh, he was obsessed with making this a, uh, commuter city.  Yeah.  Obsessed with it.  And the guy barely drove, uh, a car in his entire life.  He drove a few times, but he didn't really, he didn't really drive, but, uh, he was all  about making the highways and the bridges and, and making, uh, people commute into the 
[02:24:00]  city just to work.  And he didn't believe in New York City as, as a neighborhood anymore.  He just believed in it as a place to make money.  A place to work, and then you go out.  And get the fuck out.  Uh, the Robert Moses bridges, uh, the bridges over the parkways, uh, he, it's said that  he designed them with very low clearance so that the city buses couldn't drive out,  uh, to the beaches, uh, with undesirables.  I think that's urban legend, by the way. 
[02:24:30]  Full of undesirables.  Those, those same, like, overpasses are the same ones he built originally, and you look  at them, buses keep fit under them.  Could they?  Yeah.  No way.  I don't know about that.  On, uh, on the Southern State?  Oh my God, some of those bridges, you feel weird being in, uh, the right lane because  the bridge is arched so much.  Right.  That there's, like, maybe seven feet of clearance on that thing.  They didn't touch on that, so I don't know if it's true.  Yeah, I don't know.  But he, uh, he was obsessed with building, like, the highways, and what was interesting,  because they said there was no stopping him, because it's, it's a little too complicated, 
[02:25:00]  but he didn't really have to worry about voters.  No.  You know, he got all this power in New York City and was pretty much able to do whatever  the fuck he wanted, because he, no one was, he didn't have to be re-elected.  So that's a good thing.  So, like, when he was putting in a lot of these highways, that's what I was referring  to.  He was the one that put these highways through complete neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Destroying not only the neighborhoods, because now they're roadways, but destroying the rest  of the neighborhood that, uh, was able to continue, because now it cut off the neighborhood, 
[02:25:30]  now you can't go to the other side, because the highway's in the way, and economically it  destroyed the Bronx, uh, in particular.  Destroyed the Bronx.  Yeah, just cut it off.  And, uh, and, and people, like, after a while, hated this guy, but, uh, he, he was never up  for any type of election.  No.  So he didn't give a shit.  They finally-  He was like the Fuhrer.  What was interesting was they finally were able to stop him, because the guy, if you know  anything about New York City, he wanted a highway. 
[02:26:00]  Let's say the 59th Street Bridge.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  He wanted, or, uh, or maybe even the Long Island Expressway, one of those two, he wanted  the highway to continue all the way into Manhattan and cut pretty much right down Broadway, all  the way down to the Financial District, like a massive, massive four to eight line.  Like a highway.  Yeah.  Instead of just, uh, roads.  Right.  Which would have destroyed more of the neighborhood feel of, uh, Manhattan.  And a lot of people had a, a, a, a big time problem with that.  Straight rid of all these neighborhoods.  Could that be snarled there? 
[02:26:30]  What a deuce this guy was.  And then, you know what, the communities finally got together and some community leaders, and  they were able to finally stop Robert Moses and say, look, enough is enough.  You did some great stuff, but you got to stop with this obsession with highways everywhere.  Wants to just build roads everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For a nut.  It seemed like, yeah, he had like the car makers, uh, the car companies in his back pocket.  Ah, that's probably a good deal.  Because cars were just starting to become, you know, a way of life and people were starting  to, you know, understand what a car could do for you. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  You got to remember, all this is before they built Levittown out in, uh, Long Island and,  and, and built all these, you know, neighborhoods.  There weren't these big interstates going cross country or anything.  No.  Little roads that, uh, the towns all, all maintained.  But what happened was-  Sometimes they weren't even connected.  There would be dirt between-  And the roads that they did have, it was for the privilege.  They would take a little Sunday drive and, and, and drive.  But then all of a sudden, you know, the cars became cheaper and stuff.  And this guy's like, I'm going to take advantage of this and make as many highways as possible 
[02:27:30]  so more people buy cars.  And, you know, and then, and then they're building all these great neighborhoods out  on Long Island because now people can get to these freaking neighborhoods in their cars.  And it was, it was a little suspicious.  Like, man, he seems like he made some kind of, some kind of massive deal with the, uh, automakers.  Yeah.  Build the roads.  I wonder how much money-  People buy the cars.  He was, uh, making from, from those guys because he was their best friend, man.  Robert Moses.  Was he a Jew?  He was a, he was a weird dude. 
[02:28:00]  I just, I don't know why I blurt those things out.  That's all right.  You can't help yourself.  But he was a, he was a strange fellow.  Trying to be shocking.  They're calling him the Adolf Hitler of commuting.  Uh, what happened to Wheeze?  Yeah.  See, people do care.  Uh, Mike in Albany.  Mike.  Yellow.  Mike.  Albany.  Yellow.  Well, he asked what happened to Wheeze.  Uh, I think he's negotiating or something.  Oh.  So, really?  He's been off the air since December 21st. 
[02:28:30]  And he's got Super Agent Bob Eatman, you know, trying to do the right thing for him,  so.  Ah.  He wanted to come down here for a couple days and just do some XM with us.  That'd be fun.  He wanted, he was supposed to come in today or tomorrow.  I don't know.  I haven't heard from him, so we'll see.  Uh, let's go to Rich in Ohio.  Rich.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, a lot of these older cities like New York and Chicago, they actually built those bridges  and stuff like that for the convenience of railroads to get out of the cities.  And since then, a lot of these, uh, bridges, they can't make them higher and stuff like 
[02:29:00]  that.  I drive a truck, and what they do is they actually tunnel out the roads under the bridges,  make them lower and lower, so stuff like buses and stuff like that, trucks can get  in and out of these cities now that they didn't used to be able to.  Right.  And I heard a lot of construction people that I've worked with say the same type of thing.  A lot of these cities, not just New York, were designed inherently, whether it be to  keep in desirables out, but to keep, uh, truck traffic out or just to, they would literally  build these cities in a fashion where they control who came and went.  Right. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  The other thing I learned from this documentary, the entire subway system of, uh, New York  City was built, imagine this, in four years.  They built all those tunnels in four years and put the subway system together.  Like, when was this?  Uh, I don't, I don't know.  1998.  898.  I think it was like, uh, late 1800s to very early 1900s, if I'm not mistaken.  Because they pretty much just dug up the roads.  They, like, dug big trenches. 
[02:30:00]  But see, you...  And then put the stuff in and then covered the top over again.  Yeah, the road is basically the roof of most of the subways, but...  And it wasn't like now with traffic the way it is.  Yeah, but you, you don't really ride the subways.  When you're, uh, like, in a subway, you'll see other subways, like, going next to you and  then dip in way down, I mean, the tunnel system is pretty freaking involved.  It's not just one tunnel that's only a few feet underground.  These things go all over the place.  And they did it in four years.  Can you imagine any massive project being done in four years? 
[02:30:30]  No.  And then the other thing New York came up with, uh, my New York knowledge, obviously,  but, but the, uh, the fare for the subway.  You know, before that, any type of, like, uh, you know, train system, whatever, you had to  pay according to how far you were going.  Yeah.  And, uh, New York was the, pretty much the first system where they had one fare, which  was a nickel for like 50 years or something like that.  A nickel?  You could go anywhere in the system for, for a nickel, right?  And I'm thinking, wow, this is kind of cool and all, but if you, if you really pay attention 
[02:31:00]  to this documentary, it was all about, you know, the rich people in New York wanting to  keep like the poor people away from them.  That's, that's...  For a nickel?  Well, this is what they did.  How poor were they?  No, no, no.  Think about this though.  Like if you, let's say you lived far away, you'd be able to afford a subway ride into  New York City.  So you would think the rich people would live far away and the poor people would live very  close to Manhattan because everybody wanted to work in Manhattan.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  New York City, because it was about this rich mentality, they're like, you know what? 
[02:31:30]  If we make the freaking fair, five cents, all the poor people could live way far away where  we don't have to deal with them.  They could come in and do all the horrible jobs for us and the rich people will be able  to continue living in New York City among the rich.  That's why they did that.  I like it.  So that's why you got all the really, you know, kind of the poorer neighborhoods on the  outskirts because they can, they can afford the cheap, you know, subway fare to come into 
[02:32:00]  New York.  Do you think I'd be well-received at a public meeting or the MTA?  I said, I want to make the fares a nickel.  And they said, why?  I said, to keep out the you know what.  I just sat down.  Hear, hear.  They'd be applauding back then.  Let's say hi to Brent in Louisiana.  Brent.  Hey.  Hey.  Huey P. Long, he was one of those master politicians.  He was able to build bridges north of Baton Rouge to keep certain ships from going under  them.  So he'd keep all that big river and traffic down in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. 
[02:32:30]  And then, like, two guys built a toll bridge to the north shore.  And then he went and built a free bridge and bought it out from under, depending on the  dollar.  Wow.  There you go.  Good old Huey Long.  Who knew the bridge business was so competitive?  Yeah, no kid.  Cutthroat.  Let's go to Tom and D.C.  I'll build a bridge lower than you.  I'll tunnel up.  All right.  All right.  You're not going to make mine free.  You'll kill me.  I'll dry up the water.  They can walk.  Fucking assholes.  Bridge people are.  I hate you if you work for a bridge. 
[02:33:00]  Fucking thieves.  All I want to do is get from one side of the fucking pond to the other.  Yeah.  And you just have to deep dick us.  Help me out here.  I know.  Sorry.  We're not aquatic creatures.  Fish don't do that.  They don't put water across the land and then charge other fish.  Motherfuckers.  You could blame Robert Moses for the tolls, by the way.  He came up with that idea to pay for the stuff.  And at the time, they said, hey, when these things are paid off, no more tolls.  But somehow there was a loophole.  And once again, because he wasn't a politician, he was able to put this system in place. 
[02:33:30]  And it's now way too late to go backwards and try to figure that one out.  They bankrupt themselves, I think, and they need the money.  No, they use it as pretty much a way to raise taxes.  It's a tax.  Jersey's going through it right now.  Jersey, there's Corzine in there.  He figures he's going to increase the tolls on every toll in Jersey. 
[02:34:00]  50% a year for 10 years.  Their Jersey is expensive.  Jersey's going to get insane.  And they said, this is not something we want to do.  It's a necessity.  And it's better than raising taxes because a lot of people that use these highways are from out of state.  So it's them paying.  And it is bullshit.  That's complete bullshit.  Have you been on the New Jersey trip hike?  It's everybody commuting.  Yeah.  It's insane on a regular basis.  And all I see is New Jersey, the freaking place.  Is he talking about New Yorkers being out of state? 
[02:34:30]  That's a technicality.  Exactly.  In Pennsylvania, that's a technicality.  It's all one big area.  Yep.  You want to put a toll at the actual cement divider and just charge anybody that rams into it.  Fucking asshole with no seatbelt.  No seatbelt douche.  Fuck you.  And your tolls.  Why don't you pay them?  You don't practice what you preach?  No.  Why don't you pay them for the next 10 years?  It gets really expensive.  Yeah.  Let's say hi. 
[02:35:00]  We're going to move on to other things.  But this got the phones ringing.  So, Tom in D.C., what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Let's see if I can bring this around.  I think we're done as a country because of the local residents.  We got a drawbridge here in D.C., the Woodrow Wilson Bridge that was built in the 60s.  It was falling apart.  And I was like, okay, great.  Let's build a Throgs Neck, a Whitestone or something to make it a grand entrance into D.C.  They tore it down, built another drawbridge.  They wouldn't put a big bridge there? 
[02:35:30]  Wouldn't put a big bridge there because of the local residents.  Oh, the local residents.  I mean, they always spice up a news story.  They never can believe anything happened.  My favorite with the local residents is when a neighborhood pops up near an airport.  They buy a house and then bitch and bitch and bitch about the airport being there.  It was there already.  The planes are loud.  Yes, planes are loud. 
[02:36:00]  Guess what?  You weren't rich enough to get a better house.  That's your problem.  As far as Long Island goes, yeah.  I'm just kidding.  As far as Long Island goes, though, you really can't move anywhere without planes flying over  at some point.  I've noticed my house, when it's foggy out, when there's low clouds, they have to direct  them for some reason closer to my house, and you hear them.  Yeah, at night, sometimes going to sleep, going, holy shit, that one was close. 
[02:36:30]  Jimmy, he's hearing planes now.  Yes, ME-262s.  Yeah, they're just checking up on you.  Messerschmitts.  They're just checking up on you, making sure this is all bullshit when you spew on the radio.  Don't you worry, Anthony.  You'll be all right.  Helicopters, black helicopters.  Are Derringer's pistols that people still use?  Yeah, they still have them.  I don't know who's using them, but the women put them in their garter.  I think they were using the Old West a lot.  They're not long-range guns.  They're for putting up against someone's head and pulling the trigger. 
[02:37:00]  All right, let's move on to Jimmy in Mississippi.  Jim?  Hey, this is Jimmy in Mississippi.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, Jim, I got a funny joke for you.  Ooh.  What has four eyes and can't see?  Hmm.  I have no idea.  Mississippi!  M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.  P-P-I!  Can you spell it again, Jimmy?  M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.  Aye! 
[02:37:30]  Mississippi has four eyes and still can't see.  I think the Jamba Juice, people have a surplus of orange juice.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's an orangey flavor to my strawberry banana.  Mine's thick and laden with fruit and goodness.  What'd you say?  Thick and laden with fruit and goodness.  What'd you say?  Thick and laden with fruit and goodness.  All right, very good, Jim.  I got a joke for you.  What's got four eyes and can't see, Jim?  I don't even know. 
[02:38:00]  What's that?  Mississippi!  Mississippi!  No, a man with glasses who's been blinded by a drunk driver.  Wow, who saw that coming?  Hey, Jim, what do you got?  I just made an observation over the last few days about you guys playing those speeches from Barack Obama.  Yes.  He sounds like the rock, the rassler.  Ah.  I'm trying to figure out who he was.  The rassler.  Yeah, the rassler.  And Obama says.  You know, the speech that he made at the Iowa caucus after he won or whatever? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  He sounds just like the rock.  Can we get some clips?  Yeah, let's try to get some rock clips and that Obama clip that Jim's talking about.  Let's see.  Is he Muslim?  He is.  He might as well be down here.  He's a practicing Muslim.  I was not even voting for him down here.  I was voting for something else.  Oh, okay.  Is he?  Is he?  Is Barack Obama a practicing Muslim?  Yes.  Travis says yes.  Travis says yes. 
[02:39:00]  He would be the second Muslim president.  Well, who was the first?  Taft.  Taft was a Muslim?  Yeah.  Radical, too.  Yeah.  Radical Muslim.  Radical Muslim.  Yeah.  Look it up.  You want to throw dirt on all infidels.  Yeah.  Dirt bombs.  Wait, is he really a practicing Muslim?  I got to tell you something.  That bugs me.  Yeah, me too.  That really bugs me.  I'm not a fan of that religion.  No.  I'm not a fan of any religion being part of politics.  That's for sure.  I mean, I don't think Bush's Christian obsession has made the country any better. 
[02:39:30]  That's for sure.  But that Muslim religion, holy mother of God.  You read about that story in, where was it, Canada?  A man killed his daughter.  Oh, that's, yep.  Muslim, because she wouldn't wear her traditional fucking cover up the bitch because we can't  fucking look at her without popping boners.  Yeah.  Muslim little coveralls. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  That they put on.  She said, no, you know, I'm young.  She was a cute girl.  And, yeah, killed her.  She was disgracing him.  Yes.  Well, they handle things like that well.  I mean, they're very reasonable people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't say they're unreasonable.  You'd be called Islamophobic.  It's a good religion.  It's a nonviolent religion.  Is it?  And the fact that there's violence wherever it is, is a coincidence.  It's a coinkydink.  So to have him as a Muslim and the president, I don't know. 
[02:40:30]  That bothers me, too.  Just a little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  Probably a lot of bit.  A lot of bit.  A lot of bit.  All right.  We're going to move on.  Unbelievable tons of amounts of bit.  And we got Angry Video Game Nerd reviewer standing by.  We love this guy.  He seems to be a fan of our show because he has a wow sticker in some of his videos.  I saw that.  That was pretty cool.  What does he do?  He takes the old video games that a lot of us played growing up.  Yep.  And he now plays them in the year 2008. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  First time I got that right, by the way.  And he shows you how ridiculous the game is.  Reviews them.  Very nostalgic.  Kind of.  The guy's funny.  He just lets loose with his bad language.  Yeah.  It's his bit, man.  He found his little niche on YouTube.  And in this one, before we talk to him live, he reviews Dragon's Lair from the original Nintendo.  Did you play Dragon's Lair? 
[02:41:30]  Game sucked ass.  You remember it?  Sure.  Ooh.  OJ.  The OJ.  OJ.  Ooh.  Food.  Cool.  I don't remember this game.  I remember the name.  I remember Dragon's Lair.  Do you remember what you had to do?  No.  No?  All right.  I just remember it.  Dude, I got to piss too.  I'm the one with the stupid cartoony guy.  Huh?  I really got to piss.  Yeah, I do too.  And take over.  Okay.  Where's the button?  Well, we just take calls or something. 
[02:42:00]  All righty.  We'll be right back.  Thank you.  But, you know, I'll stay right here.  Do like a political show.  A political show?  Can't do that while you guys piss.  And we just went through a bunch of politics.  We keep him on a good call.  Anthony by himself.  This could be scary.  I'll figure something out.  Hi.  It's just Anthony taking your call.  Oh, that guy.  Who cares?  Huge pipeline on Long Island. 
[02:42:30]  I don't want to talk about that.  The Obama thing.  I'll continue with that a little bit.  Keep a safe subject.  Me talking about Obama.  It just gets me a little nervous, him being a Muslim, because I think it'll attract other  Muslims to the United States.  And I don't think he'd be as apt to get rid of them, even the extremist Muslims, as would 
[02:43:00]  somebody who's more of a Christian, even a Jew.  I wouldn't mind seeing a Jewish president first before a Muslim, that's for sure.  At least you know you're going to get maybe the economy back in order.  Because, you know, the money handling.  It's a talent.  It's a math.  Accounting.  Things like that.  That, oh, hi, Rob from New Jersey. 
[02:43:30]  Can we take a call from Rob from New Jersey?  Hey, what's going on?  Look it up on his bio.  He's not a practicing Muslim.  He's a practicing Christian.  Oh, is he?  Where did the Muslim thing come in?  His dad was born in Kenya or something.  His mom's from Kansas.  So, when he was raised, was he a Muslim and then switched to Christianity? 
[02:44:00]  No, I don't think so, but look it up.  I'm not that much sure.  Right, I heard you look it up.  Don't worry.  We'll look it up.  But I want to know if he spent any time as a Muslim.  Well, did he convert to Christianity?  His stepfather is Muslim.  What the?  What do we got, Travis?  Travis, were you selling me a bill of false goods?  No, as a child, he went to a Christian school and a Muslim school.  And...  How could you do that?  Then, as a teenager, apparently, he converted to Christianity. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, all right.  I don't think he practices either one, though.  As a teenager, he converted...  See, that doesn't make...  I don't believe any of that.  I don't believe that.  I'm telling you what I know.  By the way...  I know he smoked the weed.  Oh, yeah.  Someone is, like, calling you crazy again, Ant.  No surprise.  I'm used to it now.  At this point, you should be, right?  Yeah.  PJ?  Crazy like a fox.  From Philly.  PJ from Philly, who...  I like saying that.  Who's not part of the Philly crew, because I don't know anything about him. 
[02:45:00]  Anthony, you're a fucking retard.  You think that if Obama gets in, he's going to entertain Osama Bin Laden.  Go screw.  Did I say that, or did I say perhaps, if a Muslim president was in office,  that he would be more sympathetic to Muslims,  whether they're a little fanatic or not?  Right.  Absolutely.  I don't think, you know, we'd be on our guard like we are now. 
[02:45:30]  Okay.  I think it's a good thing.  I like profiling, too.  Thank you, too.  Here's the angry video game nerd.  So it's Dragon's Lair.  He's reviewing this.  These videos, of course, if you don't know by now, are all over YouTube.  We love this guy.  Dragon's Lair.  The adventure is a Dirk the Daring who has to rescue a princess from a dragon.  All right.  My first impression is that the graphics are quite good for the NES,  and the character animation is well-detailed.  But the controls are delayed beyond belief. 
[02:46:00]  Did I just die by walking into the door?  Yeah.  Everything kills you.  Literally.  Everything.  Even if you stop to jump, you end up falling through the bridge.  Okay, I'm going to try to kill this bat, and there I go.  Dead.  What the?  Why can't I duck?  I just want to duck down and throw my daggers at the dragon.  But no, it doesn't let you duck.  Have you ever played a game where the basic controls differ depending on which side of the screen you're standing on?  Is that true? 
[02:46:30]  It's completely different from the arcade version.  The arcade was laser disc-based, and it was a cartoon, basically.  Sure.  And it was kind of like, depending on what decisions you make, it turns out a different way.  Well, obviously, you couldn't put that on Nintendo.  You couldn't handle that.  So they made it this shitty side-scroller that was just an abomination.  That game sucked in the arcade.  People were all psyched about it because it looked great for the time because it was a cartoon. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  It was a cartoon.  And it was a time where you walked into the arcade, and it was that game next to things like Galaga and Ms. Pac-Man.  Space Invaders.  So you'd look at it and go, wow, that looks great.  But all you were really doing is, he would do something.  They'd show a cartoon clip, and it was a video, and then he'd kind of stop, and you'd have to click on a right door or straight ahead or a left door, and there he would go. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  And it would be a whole other scene.  They were like cut scenes.  Sure.  You were directing cut scenes.  You had to memorize exactly what to do and keep throwing quarters in because there was no rhyme or reason to whether down saved your life or left saved your life.  No.  No.  So, yeah, you would just have to make a decision, and then you had a one in four chance of getting it right.  Games sucked ass.  All right.  Let's play some more of this.  And this is bleeped because I thought we were going to get to it on the other side. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, that's why someone's saying much funnier if it's not bleeped.  Yeah.  I didn't think so.  We thought we were going to play it over there.  Sorry.  Our fault.  Another problem is that the dragon doesn't come up high enough to be able to hit with your dagger unless you're squatting, but when you're squatting, the dragon stays below the bridge.  It literally reacts to your every move.  So, what do you do?  Do you stand?  Do you duck?  Either way, you're a b****.  The decisions to make in this game are similar to if, say you're standing in a pool full of b**** all the way up to your neck. 
[02:48:30]  Then somebody comes in with a bucket full of b**** to dump on your head.  Do you duck down under the b**** or do you just stay up and take on the b****?  This game is like a cruel joke that you play on your friends.  It's like, hey, you want to play a game?  Here you go.  You f****.  That was a swing full of piss.  And then the bucket of shit.  Do you go under in the piss?  Everyone's screaming about the beefs.  We really thought we were playing on the first half of the show.  We know, we know, we know. 
[02:49:00]  Give us one break, will ya?  You know what else is bull****?  Everything kills you with only one hit.  The dragon, the fireball, the moat, the door.  But the bat just takes away a tiny bit of life from your life bar.  Yeah, that's right.  You have a life bar.  I didn't even notice.  But what's the point?  Because everything that hits you, it kills you instantly.  I can guarantee that the only way you're going to die from this bat is if you stand absolutely still and just wait. 
[02:49:30]  I've clocked it.  It takes one minute and 13 seconds for this bat to drain your energy.  That's 11 hits.  By the way, unfortunately I don't have my voice to do this right.  But Joe T, hopefully my voice will be back soon.  Joe T from Detroit.  He lingers longer.  He writes, dude, what the fuck?  They're censoring XM.  Copy, paste, copy, paste.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Fucking Joe T, you rock. 
[02:50:00]  And finally, one more clip.  We're going to get him on the phone, right?  We're going to get him on the phone right now?  Cool.  God damn it, man.  We're going to f*** this game, man.  Man, Jesus Christ.  I'd rather f***ing see a grizzly bear while shoving King Kong up my f***.  I'd rather f***ing stand in the middle of a ring of monkeys as they pelt me to death with their own f***.  Man, f*** this game.  F*** to hell.  We're going to f*** the damn nation of mankind.  Blind CC.  Well, I was really playing on the fact that it would be played on the other side. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  You were adding a few of your own bleeps.  Well, no, I was just picking choice cuts.  Going inside the radio a little bit.  Going inside the show.  Anybody who wanted to know, he would rather 69 a grizzly bear and shove King Kong up his ass.  Oh, what is that?  That's the game.  That's the game?  Oh, look how awful it is.  What a faggot dragon.  It's breathing f***ing smoke in the wrong direction.  And look at this stupid controller.  You forget how dumb that Nintendo controller was.  My God, did games suck. 
[02:51:00]  What the hell were we doing?  Yeah, this episode is quite long.  It goes on for like 13 minutes.  But he goes on to explain that this opening scene is so ridiculously hard.  And it's only the first screen of the game.  What's so hard about it?  Just getting across the drawbridge.  Yeah, because the controls are so awkward.  And it's just everything takes so much time to respond.  And it's just a terrible game.  It was just another excuse for these game companies to rip off the kids who actually kind of like the original game from the arcade.  The door killed them.  So they get their parents to plop down 50, 60 bucks on a game that they think is going to be like the arcade. 
[02:51:30]  And then they come home, you know, plop it in their Nintendo.  And this is what they get.  Yeah, and the dragon, like you said, if you duck, the dragon ducks out of view.  And then when you stand up, he kills you.  So.  Oh, my God.  That sucks.  We got angry video game nerd on the phone.  Angry game video nerd.  How are you?  Hey, how are you? 
[02:52:00]  It's Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and a bunch of other guys.  How are you?  I said that already.  I'm pretty good.  Good, good.  Yeah, I watched some of your work.  I loved it.  I mean, it's nostalgic, brings back memories of playing some of these shitty games.  And you got quite the take on it.  It's not just like you're reviewing these things, but you're kind of passionate about it.  Yeah, you got a great way about you as you do this.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  So, what, you played these shitty games when you were younger?  Yeah.  And decided you were going to just put them up there and talk about how crappy they were?  Yeah, like the first one I did, it was just some little joke.  And I, you know, just some stupid thing I did.  And, you know, I thought it was just funny.  Like, the whole joke was like, who would care about all these old games?  And little did I know, I gained this huge following, and everybody was like, this is hilarious. 
[02:53:00]  You got to do more.  And so I start doing more and more and more.  And then I start finding all these games I never even heard of.  And then, you know, learning about them as I'm reviewing them.  And it's been fun.  What was the first game you reviewed?  The first one was Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.  It was actually a classic game.  You know, it's in the Castlevania franchise.  But there was just lots of flaws in it, lots of things that were just, you know, really weird. 
[02:53:30]  So, it was a good one to start with.  My favorite was probably Top Gun was really a good one.  You ripped the shit out of that one.  Yeah.  My favorite thing about the Top Gun one, I was watching some of these last night.  And I was taking a look at the Power Glove one that you reviewed.  Yeah.  And the best part about the Power Glove one is that he's playing, the thing was impossible to use.  But he's playing Top Gun. 
[02:54:00]  What was the Power Glove?  It was this awful, you know, to be perfectly honest, it really reminds me of what the Wii is now.  It was basically this just, you know, infrared sensor that you'd wear on your hand and try to control the game with this shitty glove.  And he actually landed the plane in Top Gun with the fucking controller.  Yeah, yeah.  After he couldn't land it with the controller ever.  It was just impossible to land that fucking plane on the carrier.  And also, Back to the Future was another great one.  The dumbest friggin' additions in that game that had nothing to do with the movie. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know, most of the games I do are NES games or movie-based games.  Yeah.  And a lot of times it's fun to compare the movies with the games and it's like, where did they come up with these ideas?  The bowling balls?  Yeah, bowling balls.  It's like, what the hell does that have to do?  Now, what are you playing now? 
[02:55:00]  Do you actually play games now?  Like, new games?  I try to, but now I'm too occupied with just playing crappy games.  It would be nice to play some good games here and there.  Well, yeah, I play some Wii games.  Like, I've been, I played, like, the new Zelda Twilight Princess.  Jeez.  You know, but, and now I've sort of become a collector.  So I have the old, I have the Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 2600 and all that. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, you've had to, like, get all these platforms and the games themselves.  Where do you find this shit?  Yeah, a lot of times, sometimes it's eBay and I have a PayPal donation on my site so people donate.  And some people actually donate directly.  Like, I give out a P.O. box address on request.  So some people have actually sent me games.  And so I get, like, lots of stuff in the mail.  I get, like, stuff I never heard of.  I get, like, I got, like, I once mentioned in a video that I didn't have a Sega Saturn. 
[02:56:00]  And next thing I got four of them in the mail.  Of course you did.  They've been sitting in a box for the last ten years in an attic.  It's no surprise.  That thing sucked.  I got the Sega Genesis and then the add-on.  The 32X.  Yeah, yeah.  The Sega CD.  And, oh, was that awful.  They made it look like it was going to be so cool.  There was that one game where you went into the sewers, you know, and you're kind of racing around. 
[02:56:30]  And it just turned into a turn right, turn left.  Yeah.  It was, like, pushed, you know, when the arrows appear.  Yeah, the arrows appeared and you had to push the button near the arrow and then it would turn and turn into another what amounted to a cutscene.  Yeah.  Like another Dragon's Lair.  Yeah, another Dragon's Lair.  Bullshit.  Hey, you've played a lot of these old video games by now.  Which is the worst one so far?  Oh, man.  Well, my second review was Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  I think I still stand by that, that that really is one of the worst games I've ever played. 
[02:57:00]  Because back then you don't really, like, you know, take into account how bad they are.  You just, you know, you play them and that's really all there was.  But Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I remember, even back then was bad.  And if it was bad back then, it's bad.  What was bad about it?  It doesn't really make any sense, basically.  You're just walking and then all of a sudden lightning strikes and you're dead.  And that's it.  That's pretty much the game. 
[02:57:30]  You put it in for, like, ten seconds and you're done.  But what are you supposed to do?  I've never really, I think there are, like, explanations.  Like, some people have actually found out, like, what you're supposed to do.  Some people.  And you can read all about it, you know, on the Internet.  But back then no one cared about, like, what the games were about.  They just wanted to pump out games.  And they were awful.  None of them really made much sense.  Well, it was the cool factor that you could actually do this at home.  So it didn't really matter. 
[02:58:00]  They didn't really have to put a lot of thought into the actual game.  Because remember, there's a lot of us out there that remember playing Pong and thinking that was the coolest thing ever.  Yeah.  Well, it was for a little while.  You go from Pong to some of these other games that had no point.  They look cool as hell.  And that's all that mattered.  I like the franchises that are still out there.  And you compare the two.  Like, Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Okay.  It looks hysterical in its first generation.  The frame rate was ridiculous. 
[02:58:30]  You'd go to turn the plane.  And it wouldn't turn.  So you'd keep the joystick over.  And then you realize it's going to turn, like, five seconds later.  And you're upside down.  And then you try to turn it back.  And now you look now at the new flight simulator for Microsoft.  And it's just the graphics are amazing.  It looks photorealistic.  It looks photorealistic.  But, yeah, that franchise just kept going.  And actually, I remember playing that first one, though, and thinking, oh, this is so cool. 
[02:59:00]  It's really like flying a plane.  And now you look back on it.  What was I thinking?  Yeah, and it's a joke.  Yeah.  And the other thing I want to mention, you also review the porn games.  There was a time where the porn games became pretty hot.  There were a lot of them out there.  What do you have to say about that?  Well, Atari 2600 was an interesting case.  I mean, it was, like, the console that put, you know, games in, like, the pop culture, you know.  But they would just, well, for one thing, there was just an endless supply of games on Atari 
[02:59:30]  because Atari didn't need to approve any of the games that were made for it.  That, like, anybody could just make an Atari game and sell it.  That's hysterical.  Yeah, like, today, people are still making, like, homemade Atari games here and there.  But back then, like, there would just be all this ridiculous stuff, like all these porn games.  And, like, there was, like, the horror games, like, there was, like, Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 
[03:00:00]  And you see, like, a head get decapitated and there's, like, little pixelated blood comes out.  And back then, that was, like, that was shocking.  That was, like, you know, unheard of.  So, like, they wouldn't be able to sell it.  They'd have to, like, take it off the shelves and, like, only give it out, like, on a request basis.  Like, people come in and ask for it.  Like, they have to have it hidden on the counter.  Yeah, I saw that Halloween review that you did.  And the game was so homemade that they didn't even have art, like, for a sticker to put on the cartridge itself. 
[03:00:30]  So, it was just, like, a peel-off sticker.  And someone wrote with, like, marker, Halloween.  They ran out of labels.  So, they actually wrote on it with a marker.  The funny one was, what was it?  The Indian raping?  No, the cowboy raping?  Oh, the Custer's.  Oh, yeah.  We had to rape the Indian squaw.  Right.  And there was, what, sperm flying from the sky or something?  Against the cactus.  Against the cactus, right.  That one was hilarious.  Yeah, the Jizz Eater one.  I can't remember the name of it.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, Beat'em and Eat'em.  Beat'em and Eat'em, right.  Yeah, it was like Jizz was shooting out.  Yeah.  And then there was the other version.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was the other one where the whore was squirting titty milk off of the building.  Oh, that's right.  You had to avoid the titty milk.  It was the same game with the gender reversed.  Oh.  Yeah.  And they were the most deceiving boxes ever.  Because on the outside of the box, it looked so cool that you wanted to play it. 
[03:01:30]  And then you'd play the game and realize it was some side-scrolling, like, just piece of shit.  And they would always make these ridiculous claims on the box that you would know.  Like, where were they getting it from?  Like, in one of James' reviews for Rocky for the Sega Master System, it says on the cover,  it just says, Double the Mega Power.  Yeah.  And you're like, of what?  Double the Mega Power.  What?  Of Rocky?  What does that mean? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I never found out the answer to that one.  Oh, man.  James, are you ever going to review one of my favorite consoles of all time, the TurboGrafx-16?  What?  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  Ooh.  What is that?  I don't know which game, though, but I don't know.  Well, they were all pretty terrible, so I think anyone would pick.  Well, yeah, it was one of the first 16-bit consoles, so I remember when it came out,  you know, I wanted to be cooler than all my friends, and I screamed.  I was like, you know, Dad, I've got to have a TurboGrafx-16.  The ads were all, you know, in every magazine.  They all look so cool. 
[03:02:30]  And I finally got it for, I think, my birthday that year, and it was the shittiest console ever.  It was so disappointing when you would get a shitty game.  You know what was cool about it, though, was that they had, like, the games were, like,  on these little, like, memory cards sort of things, so they were, like, you know,  they weren't, like, cartridges and they weren't CDs.  They were just these little cards, and you could just, you know, like, you can store a lot of them  because they're so small.  Yeah, it's kind of like a giant memory stick sort of thing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I had the Atari, what was it, the 800 computer, and I played Star Raiders. 
[03:03:00]  That one was a cool game back in, like, the early 80s.  Oof.  Yeah.  I played Star Raiders.  It was, yeah, it looked really cool, and they didn't have to do much, just make a star field,  so that didn't take much as far as graphics go, and it was kind of a first-person thing,  which was pretty cool.  Mm-hmm.  Aside from looking at side-scrolling, like, fucking pixels. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, side-scrolling sucked.  I was at Atari.  I've never had any of the Atari computers.  They had the Atari Jaguar, which was, like, one of their last efforts.  Yeah, the Jaguar.  I was old-school Atari, and you had to become an electrician to play the games  because the stupid joystick would break so many times.  You'd replace it, and then that got expensive, so you'd start taking the thing apart  and try to, you know, fix it yourself.  I'd just stick a pen in there.  If the thing broke up, you'd stick a pen in there. 
[03:04:00]  Now, this is more breaking the connection, so, like, all of a sudden you can't go right  anymore, so then you're like, you're a kid, you're like, ah, maybe I could, like, beat  the game by not going right.  I don't know.  I'll try to figure this out.  I remember my uncle had ColecoVision, and, like, that was, like, one of the first video  game consoles I was exposed to.  I remember the joystick, it looked like a cell phone.  Like, it had all these buttons.  There was a pound sign on it, and I'd never played a game where I had to use the fucking  pound sign.  And I have, to this day, I still have no idea what you'd use those buttons for. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes it was hard just to get the game to start on, like, the ColecoVision, because  you're supposed to hit some number combination or something.  I don't know.  All right.  What's that?  Hey, Chad from Jersey writes, ask him about the Bible games he reviewed.  Are there Bible games out there?  Yeah.  Actually, it was kind of the same deal with, well, you know how, like, you know, third-party  software, you know, companies would start making games for a system, but, like, you know, for 
[03:05:00]  Atari, like, they did all the porn games, but Nintendo had more of a, like, you know, would  put their foot down on that sort of thing.  But there was still a company called Color Dreams.  I think they changed it to Wisdom Tree.  And they were making all these, like, Christian games, but they were, like, illegal because  they were being made for the Nintendo and they weren't supposed to be.  So they made all these Bible games, and there was, like, there's Bible Adventures, which has,  like, three games in it, and there's, one is, it's like Noah, and you're just, like, 
[03:05:30]  carrying the animals to the ark.  And then there's one where you're, like, trying to carry baby Moses.  And then, oh, the most ridiculous thing of all was, you remember Wolfenstein, like, you  know, with the first-person shooter game?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they took that.  They took the same engine for that game, and they made a Noah game out of it on the  Super Nintendo.  It's called Super Noah's Ark 3D.  And you're basically Noah going around in an ark just shooting a bunch of goats. 
[03:06:00]  And it's weird because, like, wasn't Noah supposed to bring, like, two of each animal?  Like, why?  Goats.  Like, a whole bunch of murdered goats.  That's ridiculous.  That's so ridiculous.  And I like that the production value of your reviews have really stepped up in some of the  more recent months.  Have you gotten sponsored by game trailers?  Uh, yeah.  Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean, the first ones, like, I was, you know, it was just sort of 
[03:06:30]  one thing I do.  Like, you know, I'm a movie buff and, uh, you know, indie filmmaker.  But that was just, like, one little thing I did as a joke.  But since then, as this thing has just kept getting more and more popular, I've been putting  more into them.  Um, but I also do them really quickly.  Like, I pretty much, on average, put one out every two weeks.  Wow.  So I do them really quickly, but, um, uh, as much as I can with the time, I definitely  try to step it up as much as, uh, as much as I can.  You got a regular job?  Um, yeah.  I mean, it's, it's all kind of like all freelance stuff. 
[03:07:00]  So I just do a bunch of different, uh, uh, things.  I'm an editor for, uh, dvideography.com.  Um, and I have a DVD out, so, uh, you can buy the, the Angry Nerd DVD at  screwingback.com.  At what.com?  Uh, screwattack.com.  Screwattack.  Yeah.  Okay.  And your, and your website is on, is, uh, cinemassacre.com, correct?  Yeah, my personal site is cinemassacre.com. 
[03:07:30]  That's, uh, cinema and massacre put together.  Mm-hmm.  Um, you can watch all the videos on gametrailers.com.  And, uh, you can see the nerd site at angryvgnerd.com.  And that's where you can see an updated list of all the nerd videos.  Now, are you, are you still the ninth most subscribed, uh, video channel?  Uh, it's at eight now.  Nice.  Ooh.  Hey, look at that.  You found a nice niche for yourself.  You certainly did.  All right.  Well, well, we've been meaning to talk to you for a while because, uh, your videos have  definitely been entertaining all of us. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, it's awesome, yeah.  So.  You play Call of Duty?  Call of Duty?  Uh, no.  I actually played a little bit, uh, but no, I haven't really gotten into that much yet.  It rocks.  You should try to, like, review some of the newer games just for a goof.  Oh, yeah.  And try to find something ridiculous about them.  Oh, there are some bad ones out there.  Or we might have to wait 20 years and then, uh.  Yeah.  And then they'll look ridiculous.  Yeah, like in the Christmas cattle video I just did, it's like, uh, I go to, I do,  like, the three ghosts, uh, Christmas past and all that. 
[03:08:30]  And I go to future and I'm, uh, I'm an old man playing the Wii.  So maybe when that actually happens, I'll really, if I'm still doing this thing.  The Wii, very good.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Well, thanks for calling our show today, sir.  All right, thanks for having me.  And continued success.  Uh, plug one of the many websites one more time.  Which one do you want to plug the most?  Uh, one, uh, which one do I want to plug?  Uh, gee.  Well, I guess watch the videos on Game Trailers. 
[03:09:00]  Game Trailers.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, James.  Thank you so much.  Continued success for you.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  There he goes, James.  The Angry Video Game Nerd.  He's, uh, he's into his video games, you know.  What's wrong?  Just saying.  Into his video games. 
[03:09:30]  Not the most talkative guy when he's not on the, uh.  I had a feeling that was going to happen to you because every time I had to talk to him  on the phone, I would, you know, try to have a dialogue and he would just be like,  okay.  Danny really piggybacked that one, I gotta say.  Like when he talks, when he talks on his reviews, he's really, you know, he's going at it.  Very animated.  Yeah, that's what was so surprising to me because, you know, he's so outgoing and, you know,  creative with these videos.  Because you figured he would just be able to spew out anything bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Without a problem.  Then you get a lot. 
[03:10:00]  So, yeah, the video game and, uh, you reviewed that, uh, you reviewed that one and it was  pretty, uh, slow moving and stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, at least he wasn't, you know, confrontational.  Yeah, yeah.  That would have been, uh, a little awkward.  When you're a radio host and, uh, you ask a pretty involved question and the answer is  yeah.  Yeah.  It puts you in a weird position.  Because, like, you need a little more time to think up the next question.  Right.  So when you just get a yeah, you kind of go, oh, oh, I should have had another question.  We still like James. 
[03:10:30]  I'm going to check it out.  He might have been a little nervous.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to check out some of his, because I know he's done other interviews, you know,  with, like, websites and stuff like that.  But I think he might have just been intimidated because of the show.  Oh, no.  I mean, he's a fan.  He might have just been.  Oh, all right.  He's scared.  Very good.  Hey, we're going to turn this whole thing around after the break.  I'm going to turn it around.  We really are.  Because we got episode, uh, two of the Mad Scientist and Epstein.  Oh, wow.  And can we talk about Jack Rhodes?  Jack Rhodes.  Jack Rhodes. 
[03:11:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's a sin.  People don't know who Jack Rhodes is.  A sin.  We're going to find out who Jack Rhodes is next.  Yes, we are.  How about a hint?  Um, where's my hat?  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Is that really a good hint?  You bet your bottom dollar it is.  All right.  Are you guys having fun out there?  Yeah, what the hell's going on out there?  Wow, it's a real party.  Yeah.  Four people.  See what they're about. 
[03:11:30]  See if they got anything for the show today.  Sure.  There's four of them just sitting there staring at us.  Yeah, they're just like.  Like we're a fucking PBS documentary.  Oh, she's just waving.  Hi, miss.  She was just flirting with us, sir.  You might want to smack her for that.  I don't know.  Jeez.  You guys go out or something?  Kind of?  Sort of?  Oh, that's your boyfriend?  Wishy-washy?  Well, thanks for coming by.  We appreciate it.  We're going to find out who Jack Rhodes is next, and we do episode two of The Mad Scientist  and Epstein.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Epstein.  Yeah, yeah.  I like to say Streen.  Oh.  Epstein.  Does it really matter?  They're adamant.  Yes.  That is Ep...  I couldn't care less.  Epstein.  I couldn't care less.  Thank you.  Thanks for me.  Epstein.  Epstein.  First episode, there was a lot of things going up someone's butt.  Epstein's butt or The Mad Scientist?  I don't know.  Steve.  What?  It was going up Steve's butt.  Let's just...  Not my butt.  Oh, by the way, I got an email from Steve.  I think...  Did a lot of us get the email from Steve about where he shaved his beard?  No, that was just you.  All right, we'll do that after the break, too. 
[03:12:30]  Opian Anthony.  It's Flea Man from Westchester.  I love Jim Norton because of his brutal honesty, his hilarious commentary on society, and that  he likes to kill, rape, and eat people and admit it.  Do you have any fantasies about Jim?  I'd like to be in between him and Rich Voss and have him flip a coin to decide who fucks  me.  Fucks me.  Fucks me.  Fucks me.  Opian Anthony.  It's Opian Anthony, Jim Norton, and Ralphie May in studio. 
[03:13:00]  What's up, Ralphie?  Oh, man.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, the snipers on Pal Talk.  Broadcasting live from the Big Apple with Ralphie May.  Where are you going to be?  Bananas?  Yeah, I'm at Bananas this weekend in Poughkeepsie and Hasbrook Heights.  And then next week, I'm at the South Beach Comedy Festival with Jeffrey Ross. 
[03:13:30]  Very cool.  And you were saying, just as you were sitting down, that you're a little tired.  You only had, what, four hours sleep because you got a colicky?  Yeah.  Or a colicky?  Or how do you say that?  A colicky baby.  A colicky baby.  His hair is like in a little curl.  She does look like Bob's big boy.  She does.  She's got the curls.  She's only got one puff of hair.  Yeah, she's got colicky because she's traveling.  And so she's giving me static.  What does colic do?  It's a catch-all.  It's not really a basic thing. 
[03:14:00]  It's usually just gas, but where they cry, like, incessantly.  Really?  Yeah, and you give her gas medicine, and you walk her, and you burp her, and she falls  asleep, and it's up for like five minutes, and then bam, comes again.  How close do you get to hitting her?  Not her at all.  I'm not saying actually hitting, but the thought of holy shit.  Shaking.  Shake the baby.  Yeah, how about a shake?  I hear if you turn the baby upside down, and shake the shit out of it, it'll fart. 
[03:14:30]  You're right.  If you shake that heart.  Just shake it.  How close have you come to muffling?  Are you a muffler?  You're not a hitter.  You're not a shaker.  I'm always close to muffling something.  You know, I mean, a titty can rub over and take the breath out of her.  You know, there's always that danger when you're fat.  But, yeah, she's awesome.  But, man, it's the last couple of days.  I mean, usually she gives us like eight hours of sleep.  She's perfect.  That's very good.  Man, the last, ugh.  Hey, we got lots to do.  We got this thing, Ralph. 
[03:15:00]  You're going to love it.  It's Steve and Sam present The Mad Scientist and Epstein.  Epstein.  Hey, where's the first episode?  Our staff likes making characters.  They like character-based comedy shtick.  And this one, we listened to part one, and apparently one of the characters,  I'm not sure which is which, likes having things pounded up their ass.  You got the scientist inventing everything, and then what? 
[03:15:30]  His assistant is pounding?  Yes, yes.  The scientist invents the thing, and they only have one prototype.  They get behind the scenes of the whole thing.  Yeah, Sam's best to explain.  No, no, no.  I am the inventor.  And he's Epstein.  You're the inventor.  Of course he's the one shoving shit up his ass.  I couldn't tell who was who.  The inventor.  Also known as the mad scientist.  He was the mad scientist, but he's not necessarily crazy, because he's a good guy.  But it's called the mad scientist.  It's a working title. 
[03:16:00]  That's just the pilot.  Basically, he creates inventions that will benefit society greatly.  And while he just has the one prototype, he shows his assistant, Epstein,  who is a large, well-groomed guy who wears a Captain Caveman outfit that's too short for him,  and sits on the floor, picking up his testicles and then dropping them again.  Right, which we get more of in episode two. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, good, because in episode one, I wasn't getting any of that.  No, we fleshed this out more in episode two, so we have a lot more sound design in this one.  Sam, you learned from Steve, by the way, because this is like how Steve explained Ramon back in the day.  Well, we put a lot of thought into these characters to make sure that they were substantial.  You've got to have backstory, even if it's a little crazy.  By the way, before we play episode one again, I get an email from Steve.  Jump in any time, Ralph.  Is he trying to book Jack Rhodes?  Steve, I'm shocked.  That's okay, I'm just saying. 
[03:17:00]  The wonderment.  It is stunning.  Full of anticipation at hearing everything up his butt and dropping testicles.  Most of us have noticed that Steve grew a massively full beard in like three days, right?  Yes.  Everyone remembers the huge beard he had?  Wow.  He got rid of the beard yesterday.  Ah.  And he writes me an email, and he goes, uh, I wish I still had it.  I got it, hold on.  You have the exact one?  Scrolls, scrolls, scrolls, scrolls, scrolls, scrolls.  It was just creepy.  How you wrote this.  Let me see if I can find it. 
[03:17:30]  Oh.  I was asking, oh.  Scroll.  More scrolling and scrolls, scrolls.  I'm about to read.  Thank you very much.  Oh, yes.  Thank you.  I said, I just shaved my beard in a gas station bathroom.  What a fucking creep I am.  Why?  There was no one on the other side of the hole?  Yeah, right?  I was in there for hours waiting.  He was pretty.  He was trying to make himself more pretty because it wasn't working the other way.  I swear.  I shaved with a wide stance. 
[03:18:00]  That's the only reason.  I had just got done.  Tiny thing.  Nobody here likes bears.  My ass and ball.  And so I figured, why not shave my beard?  In a gas station.  Why in a gas station?  A gas station bathroom.  I was going out to dinner with my father last night and I didn't have enough time to get  back home after I had just gotten a haircut and my beard trimmed.  And what he didn't do was I didn't get clean shaven after he trimmed my beard.  So I had all this stubble underneath and I looked basically more dirt baggish than I 
[03:18:30]  usually do, which is, you know, semi dirt baggish.  Anyway, so I had some time to kill before.  I had to go.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  Wow.  The best part was to swallow after semi dirt baggish.  Yes.  Like you were waiting for someone to jump in.  Waiting for someone to jump in to bail you out.  Like, you know, you're not dirt baggish at all.  No, that was, that was like, cause he was joking, but that was the mental, he had the  timing of a joke, but just none of the ensuing laughter.  He's exactly right. 
[03:19:00]  Which is more than normal.  Moving forward.  Anyway, I, uh, I had time to kill.  So I, uh, went to a gas station and got these disposable razors and believe me, the whole  time I'm doing this, I'm contemplating, wow, this is fucking creepy.  I'm about to go into a men's room at a fucking gas station in Jersey and shave to make myself  look less creepy before I go to dinner.  And so I sat there, you know, with this lubricated razor shaving. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, I was going to ask you about the lubrication.  I was wondering if you were going to use the jizz from the guy.  No, I wasn't shaving my tonsils.  It's a good exfoliant.  I like when Steve does a parody of Steve.  Yes.  Steve does a good Steve.  We got him so fucked up, man.  You're just adding to the characters that are already there.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I just, I, so I, I, I had to clean all this up.  So, cause I had to get the Fu Manchu back looking, uh, looking nice. 
[03:20:00]  Cause the, the, the full beard, I, as, as predicted, got really fucking itchy and I started  to see all the gray hairs.  Your beard is very complicated.  Yeah, it is.  That's a lot of work to keep that up.  It is.  And I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was directing my, uh, my barber and he  was just like, how do I want it?  So I was showing him my license photo and I was like, no, see how it's like this.  And we got like this and, uh, yeah, I'm just, it's, it's a lot more work than really needs  to be done by anybody.  But I do it.  All right.  Cool.  So back to, uh, the mad scientist and Epstein. 
[03:20:30]  Go ahead.  So are we ready to play episode one?  Did you guys, uh, we've established, I mean, um, okay.  That's the longest established in my life.  It's just a quick question.  Steve, do you own one shirt with sleeves?  Um, one shirt.  Yeah, I wore it yesterday.  Yeah, I did.  I wore a shirt with sleeves yesterday.  It was new.  It was mesh.  It was mesh.  You look like shorts.  Of course.  You do like showing off your arms.  I do.  It's other men.  I do.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  And his tats.  His big arms and his tats.  Yeah, no, I'm not going to say, I just agree.  Ralphie, he shaves his entire body.  He does.  God, I'm glad I'm not hairy if I had to do that.  Wait, are you shaving something every single day?  And I'm not even talking, let's keep your face out of it, because most guys have to  get a shave done every day on the face.  No.  But besides that, are you shaving every day?  It's the same thing you have to say if there's a cock in the room.  Do you shave every day?  Is there a part of your body you're shaving constantly? 
[03:21:30]  No.  Every other day, probably.  Your arms?  Yeah.  It's usually arms.  Legs?  No.  I nared my legs once.  It was the worst experience that I friggin'.  I wanted to see if I was getting any more vascular definition in my legs from all the  friggin' workouts I was doing.  Is that what you told yourself?  How hairy are you that you can't see muscle development?  Are you Armenian?  Are you Armenian?  It's better through pantyhose.  No, I'm Italian and Lebanese.  Italian and Lebanese?  Oh, God.  How hairy are you?  Extremely. 
[03:22:00]  You can't see muscle development unless you shave?  Steve, come on.  It's awful.  Let's see how hairy you're like.  Steve's teen wolf.  Well, now it's still growing back.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Here's Steve's hairy wolf.  Oh, man.  You can see muscle development through that.  You can a little, but I wanted to see if the veins were popping out.  That's barely hairy.  This guy's obsessed with his body.  Well, you spend enough time being completely overweight and insecure, 
[03:22:30]  and you go in the other direction very quickly once you get there.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Look at Ralph.  Steve was giant.  I'm a train wreck.  I don't look at anything.  Steve was gigantic.  I used to weigh 400 pounds.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  How much you weigh, Ralphie?  I'm under 400.  Kick ass.  Are you really?  Yeah, about 392.  He was...  How big were you at your...  That's half.  During the foundry years.  That was probably when I was at my heaviest. 
[03:23:00]  That was 400 plus, you know, 405 probably.  Wow, congratulations.  At that point, it's truck stops.  What do you weigh now?  250, 245.  And you guys had the same surgery, right, Ralph?  I guess.  I had the ruin-wide gastric bypass.  Yeah.  Mine was a vertical banded gastroplasty.  So, like, some variation of the same surgery.  Are you still losing?  Yeah.  So, do you feel better?  You've lost a lot of weight.  Like, do you feel a lot better?  I feel so much better.  My knees feel better. 
[03:23:30]  My hips, my ankles, my feet.  How much have you lost?  Since I had the surgery, 250 pounds.  When I did last comic, I was around 650.  Come on.  What do you want to get down to?  I want to buy clothes in the mall.  That's all I've ever wanted to do.  Do what?  Buy clothes in the mall other than socks and shoes and a hat.  That's all I've ever been able to buy in a mall.  Well, how much do you want to wear?  What would you say?  Would you want to get down to what?  What do you not like?  You said you're under four. 
[03:24:00]  What's that mean?  390?  Yeah, 390.  So, would you want to get down to 200?  I'd love to be down to 200.  And you know what?  As soon as I get this stupid plantar fasciitis thing fixed on my foot.  What's that?  It's like the ripping of the tendon at the bottom of your foot.  Ow.  And then it heals up and it shrinks.  Oh, my God.  It feels like it rips every morning, it feels like.  And as soon as I get that done, I'm taken care of.  I'm back fully.  I'm just swimming right now, doing underwater robes and stuff like that.  Oh, no more underwater footage, Ralphie. 
[03:24:30]  No, no, no, no.  I swear to God.  Oh, my God.  I apologize to everybody and you're absolutely right.  It was horrific.  It looked like SeaWorld.  You should punch everybody that put that Celebrity Fit Club together.  They used it as a promo for years.  Oh, boy, did they.  They did not do right by you.  They didn't do right by you, sir.  No.  Look how fast Steve was.  Yeah, Steve.  Look at how fast Tito put you down.  Wow.  Fighting Tito.  11 seconds.  I was knocked out.  I just went to a UFC match and sat behind him and Jenna Jameson. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, that's right.  They're going out, right?  I've got a picture of her eating a cheeseburger.  Oh.  I took a picture of her.  All right.  Let's play the first episode of The Mad Scientist and Epstein.  Did this one feature Jack Rhodes?  No.  Wait.  We'll do the Jack Rhodes after this.  I didn't remember that.  Okay.  Oh, come on.  Oh, please.  Why would it work, Chessie?  But sometimes Epstein.  Epstein.  Look and see what I've concocted. 
[03:25:30]  This conveniently sized apparatus will transform any ordinary tap water into a combustible  fuel to be used in automobiles.  It will revolutionize energy consumption as we know it.  Please handle it gently.  It's the only one of its kind.  Quite impressive.  It's most compact.  Perhaps it would fit in my hiney? 
[03:26:00]  No, Epstein.  No.  No, Epstein.  No.  It's pointy.  It's just one of a...  Oh, don't pull grease all over it.  It's going in.  Epstein!  It's almost there.  It's in my hiney.  Right.  Back to the drawing board then.  At least you had a strong ending. 
[03:26:30]  And so that was episode one.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't wait for episode two.  I can't do it.  Mine hiney.  You're absolutely right, Opie.  I do love this.  Episode two, the phantom humor.  It felt like the first episode was good enough for a second one.  I will say mine hiney is funny.  Mine hiney.  Yes.  No offense to Sam, I'm sure.  Well, you just gotta come up with a... 
[03:27:00]  It's like the Ramon thing.  It was...  If you're gonna end these things the same way, you gotta think of a creative way to get there  every time.  And that's always the challenge.  We based the whole series of skits around Steve coming up with mine hiney in his head.  And we had to figure out some way to work it into something.  To work mine hiney.  I mean, of course, of course, why?  All right, so episode two is in front of me.  Can't wait for episode two now.  It's really good.  He's a mess. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, he's right there.  Episode two, go ahead.  What do we need to know about episode two?  Well, the characters have been a lot more fleshed out.  We learned that the inventor is in a wheelchair.  Yeah, he's older.  He's older than we originally thought.  He's very old.  He's in a wheelchair.  That's why he needs an assistant so badly.  Right.  Yeah, because we asked you about that.  So why would you keep this guy around if he's shoving all your inventions up his ass?  Because he's a sweet old man in a wheelchair.  He doesn't need a caretaker.  Now we understand that much.  And Epstein does spend the majority of his time sitting on the floor, Indian style, 
[03:28:00]  picking up his rather large engorged testicles up in the air and then dropping them.  So you will hear that as well.  And there's a paint can full of lard that Epstein keeps next to him.  At all times.  Yes.  And that's what we need to know?  Putting stuff up a mine hiney.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I think, yeah, that's enough of the setup and the rest of it should be done.  And the inventor has an invention.  This is ridiculous.  It's wonderful.  Yes.  All right.  Episode two. 
[03:28:30]  Shaved his beard in again.  Yeah.  That is creepy.  All right.  Here we go.  Episode two.  The mad scientist.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Stop playing with your testicles and look what I've done.  This conveniently shaped vial contains an elixir which will increase the metabolism of anyone who drinks it. 
[03:29:00]  Can you imagine?  This could eliminate the worldwide obesity epidemic permanently.  No.  Let me see.  Well, I suppose if you're careful, there's just the one and...  Say, this would fit perfectly.  In mine hiney?  No.  No.  No.  It's in. 
[03:29:30]  It's in mine hiney.  Well, at least it's still intact.  Now, give it back.  Here you go.  No.  No.  What the fuck?  My elixir.  It's all over the ceiling.  Epstein.  You.  You.  Well, back to the drawing board, I suppose. 
[03:30:00]  All right.  I got to be honest here.  You're, you're, you're, you're, you're turning me around a little bit.  Yeah.  You're turning me around to want to walk out of the studio.  What I'm talking about.  Two out of three ain't bad.  He's turning me around a little bit.  Much better.  A little bit.  Mine hiney.  Got the catchphrase.  He does have the catchphrase.  And no matter what, uh, he tries to do, he's still going to have his invention up to this guy's hiney.  Now, inventor, inventor, if it was an elixir, it's not like a prototype machine or something. 
[03:30:30]  Wouldn't you just have the formula and you can, but the problem is.  Oh, see, they got to ask for everything.  He just made one vial full of the elixir.  Yeah.  But he's got the formula.  He just, he throws things together, you know?  Like, he doesn't, he doesn't write everything down.  Then, then what was he going to do with it anyway?  Yeah, even if he had it, he couldn't have fucking made more of it.  No, once you have it, then he has a machine that you can put it into that will examine the, uh, ingredients.  And the amounts of said ingredients. 
[03:31:00]  And then that way he can produce more.  You read it off Star Trek, don't you?  Yeah.  You're just a fucking asshole.  What?  That's exactly right.  This is a completely reasonable explanation for why he doesn't make this up as we go along.  Let's go to Buffalo.  Rick, what's up?  How come he hasn't put the machine that analyzes it up in my hiney?  Yeah.  What, are you trying to ruin the whole season?  No, because he hasn't.  It's like lost.  I don't know what's going on.  And you have to make sure you catch it from the first episode. 
[03:31:30]  Let's say hi to Rick Buffalo.  Go ahead.  Ramon Epstein sucks.  It's Epstein.  I didn't like it.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Epstein sucks.  Hi, Cam.  All right.  By the way, Dan in Pittsburgh, Ralphie killed at Seven Springs.  He won over 900 Steelers fans that didn't want to be there.  It was inspirational.  Thanks, Ralphie.  And thanks for saving the boys.  Did a good one down there in Pittsburgh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was last week, last Saturday during the playoff game. 
[03:32:00]  Cool.  Wait, you had to do comedy as these guys are getting ready for a playoff game?  No.  The playoff game started at 8.  My show started at 8.  And I had 900 Steelers fans, instead of watching the game, came to see me.  And then they got the last seven minutes of it.  Oh, cool.  Very cool.  All right.  Max in Dallas.  Max.  What's going on, guys?  Ralphie, you are a funny bastard, dude.  Not today.  Not today.  But I'm trying, brother. 
[03:32:30]  Thank you.  I think they should do to Steve and Sam what they did to the female fringe collaborators  at the end of World War II.  That was awful.  Punch it out.  Oof.  I have, I guess, you know, beat them and shaved their heads.  Okay.  Greg in West Virginia.  Greg?  Sounds like a bad Adam Sandler movie.  I guess I missed the Adam Sandler movie where he shoves inventions in his ass.  See, Sam doesn't put up with shit.  Sam's very defensive. 
[03:33:00]  He's quick.  And you're going after him.  Pat from Monaco, he writes, wheelchair Fred's going to sue for character infringement.  There's someone.  And of course, Pat will linger longer with us.  All right.  Anything else you want to say about that?  Episode three coming soon.  Episode three coming soon.  Oh, boy.  I can't wait.  Oh, man.  Could you give us a little bit of a like, send me the CD?  Yeah, come on.  What about, you know, next week on, you know, we don't get a preview?  Something else will go in Epstein's hiney.  Ah.  The inventor will have a brand new invention and he'll show it to Epstein. 
[03:33:30]  And will the inventor ever catch on that he shouldn't show Epstein the invention?  It's one of those questions like you just listen.  You go, will he ever learn?  Yeah.  And since he's the assistant, why does he always wait until it's completely done before  he shoves it up his mein hiney?  See, the vial itself.  Yeah.  He could shove all those he wants up his mein hiney.  But you see, the inventor is not presenting the vials to Epstein. 
[03:34:00]  Epstein does not have the wherewithal to get up off of his floor.  Oh, he just doesn't realize he could.  He's just playing with his balls all day.  Oh, and that distracts him.  Yeah, he's so.  Until you come up and say, ah.  Ah, I've done something.  Until the inventor comes out.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, the inventor.  I'm sorry.  I said you.  And Steve is cracking the whip.  Any other characters in development with the guys?  Yeah.  Actually, we have Travis as a character who's been sort of lingering around.  I believe it's a German character. 
[03:34:30]  A man?  Is it?  Is it a German character?  I think it's a man.  Oh, here comes Travis.  It's the character of making fun of Steve.  Ralphie, can you give up your seat for a girl, please?  Of course.  All right.  There you go.  Lady?  Oh, boy.  Oh, Ralphie.  It's a boy.  We always get confused.  I'm sorry.  You can sit back down.  Ladies.  All right.  Travis?  Steve likes to push any time you maybe alter your voice in the office.  Yeah.  It's suddenly a new character. 
[03:35:00]  Yes, it is.  And how did you alter your voice one day?  I just said, this is Stebbs, because Steve would be German, and Steve says, oh, new character.  No, no, no, no, no.  So, no matter what, you do.  It wasn't.  It was not Stebbs.  I believe he has a last name.  Oh, it's Stebbs to Boners.  These guys are just full of characters.  They're sleep deprived.  I like that. 
[03:35:30]  So, apparently.  So, now you have to write a whole bit around this?  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, I decided to just open my mouth.  I have to create a whole backstory for Stebbs to Boners, who I have a feeling will be a weird  producer who likes to make his staff members do stuff they don't want to do.  Ah!  With their heinies.  Yeah, with their heinies.  Mine heinie.  I suggest that every character that is developed under the Steve umbrella has to have something  to do with the heinie.  Going up mine heinie?  Well, or just the heinie has to be involved with every character developed under the umbrella 
[03:36:00]  of Steve.  I don't need to suggest that.  It's going to happen.  Yeah.  Obviously.  There's not enough male asshole in this one.  Go back and redo it.  Wishful thinking.  I've got to go back to the gas station bathroom to get inspiration.  I think Fan and I might work on something that I just suggested.  Oh.  Oh, what's that?  You've got to...  No, we can't.  Can't.  Why?  No.  Big secret.  Don't spill the beans.  It's a good one.  That beard is becoming very impressive. 
[03:36:30]  I think you turned the corner this week with the beard.  You look like my cabbie.  He's part of Afro Wars.  That's why this thing, who will not admit that he's got a little black in him, is growing  that massive afro.  Right, Ralphie?  Yeah.  There's more than one black stick in that wood pile.  I believe in the South.  I can spot it.  Yep.  But he's in the middle of Afro Wars.  And Than is too, but he's doing the beard because he's a little...  He's got all his hair, but he can grow an afro up there.  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  I'm going to make volume.  So he's going with the beard.  All right.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Any other characters, Steve?  Oh, you never know.  You never know.  You never know.  He's such a tease.  You know what?  And it's not fair.  I've heard Travis prattle on in the Steves De Boners voice.  That is true.  So to say he's being forced at gunpoint to create a character is a little bit misleading.  I've heard him go on and on in this character voice enough so that you could actually create  a promo out of these phrases he's using. 
[03:37:30]  Is this true?  Sure.  But Steve insists that they all have backstories and fucking biographies.  Of course.  How do you keep a bit going?  What are some of your catchphrases?  I have none.  Does he have a catchphrase?  No.  I've heard him going on in the voice.  I just say, I'm Steves De Boners.  Oh.  Let's hear that again.  I'm Steves De Boners.  And that's all you got?  And that's it.  No.  He said more than that.  He's just not stressing up.  All of a sudden he can win Italian. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  He's not seeing your character.  Because he's not really, he doesn't want to be part of this.  No.  It's not that.  If I have a good idea, like for instance what I just suggested to the fan, then I'll work  on it.  But something stupid, I'm not just going to create a back, I'm not going to force something,  you know?  Oh, well.  Don't force anything.  No.  It comes naturally.  It's a bunch of bones.  Jeez.  All right.  Get the fuck out of here.  Hey, someone suggested that Barack Obama sounds like The Rock. 
[03:38:30]  And we got The Rock Obama.  We got The Rock talking or doing his thing, and then we got Barack Obama.  We're going to check this out for ourselves.  Here's The Rock, of course.  Sure, The Rock remembers you.  Sixth grade.  Home ec class, right?  Oh, he does.  Do you remember how all year long the only thing The Rock wanted to do in your class was  make pancakes?  In home ec? 
[03:39:00]  Uh-oh.  And you never let The Rock make his pancakes, did you?  You wanted The Rock to make chocolate chip cookies, blueberry muffins, but never pancakes.  I'm getting so excited.  On your summer vacation, you said, hey, Rock, tomorrow I got a nice surprise because I'm  going to let you finally make your pancakes.  And then the next day, you came to The Rock and you said, Rock, unfortunately, I'm all out 
[03:39:30]  of Aunt Jemima.  And now, now, Barack Obama.  Thank you, Iowa.  Yo, they said, they said, they said this day would never come.  They said, our sights were set too high. 
[03:40:00]  They said, this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around  a common purpose.  What?  But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the  cynics said we couldn't do.  Uh-oh.  But that's okay, but The Rock says this, hey, uh, you still like to cook? 
[03:40:30]  You still like to, you still like to bake bread?  And you know your roles, right?  Woody.  Buttermilk.  Well, then, The Rock says this.  You should know your role and shut your mouth.  Whoa.  Oh. 
[03:41:00]  Take a little walk down Know Your Role Boulevard.  Just hang that right on Jabroni Drive.  Jabroni Drive.  And then proceed to check your Aunt Jemima.  No pancake having a**.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Directly into the Smackdown Hotel.  This is supposed to be The Rock's life.  Does he have no respect? 
[03:41:30]  That shit was funny, man.  That is definitely a similarity.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Except Obama's now stealing Malcolm X's Cadence.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  On this day, in this hour, he stole fucking, uh, Mandela's Cadence at the end of, uh, Malcolm X.  Although I think Malcolm X had his first in the 60s.  How about, uh, Jack?  That's just me.  What about Jack Rhodes?  Yeah, what about him?  Jack Rhodes fucking threw quite a punch.  Fucking known around his neighborhood as the hat remover. 
[03:42:00]  Fucking Jack Rhodes will take a motherfucking hat off your head with a punch.  Just everybody knew the name Big Nick, right?  We all know who Big Nick was.  Ah, okay.  We all know who Big Nick was.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  But Jack Rhodes.  Damn.  We don't know.  Yeah.  I don't like that hat. 
[03:42:30]  How do I take it off?  With a punch.  Punch to the face.  Yep.  And that hat comes right off.  Whose hat?  I don't know.  And, and, and why did he hit him?  Her.  Her.  Her?  Even better.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't like her hat.  Oh, was that the, oh, okay.  Jack Rhodes will remove your old lady hat by engaging in fisticuffs while you hold a walker. 
[03:43:00]  That's the guy that punched the old lady in the head.  He's the black gentleman who beat up the old white lady.  Right.  And she was like pushing a hundred.  She was over 101.  101.  Okay.  101 years young.  And she took a punch.  Oh my God.  She was like fucking, like fucking La Mata.  Fucking Sugar Ray, Sugar Ray Rhodes couldn't get her down.  He fucking, he socked that old bitch in the head.  And nobody knows his name.  We all knew who Big Nick was when he fucking dropped an N-bomb when hitting black guys who 
[03:43:30]  were there to steal cars.  We all knew who he was.  This fucking savage motherfucker beat a 101 year old woman and it's on page fucking 25  of the paper when they catch him.  And they caught him what?  Overnight or something?  I don't know, but it's him.  And his name's Jack Rhodes.  Jack Rhodes.  There you go.  There's the answer.  He's a 45 year old drug addict.  And it's on page 14 of Newsday.  Oh, it's not his fault then.  Why don't you have a little mercy?  Yeah.  I feel sorry.  During the court, you imagine this happened with a white guy who beat up an old black  lady. 
[03:44:00]  During the court thing, it says, clean shaven with short hair and wearing a tan shirt.  Rhodes chuckled at one point when the detective said Elisi, the old lady, described her attacker  as a man much larger than Rhodes appears to be.  Do you find that amusing?  LASIK asked him.  Which I guess was the judge.  Uh, no sir, I don't find it amusing, he told the judge.  But he chuckled.  Chuckled.  Yeah.  And there you go.  Jack Rhodes.  What a bastard.  That's who he is.  Funny nobody knows his name, though.  No.  We all knew Fat Nick was. 
[03:44:30]  Well, with that, we're going to wrap up the show for today.  Ralphie's going to be at the Bananas.  Yeah.  In Poughkeepsie.  In Poughkeepsie on Friday, uh, uh, two shows, uh, three shows on, uh, Saturday at Hasbrok  Heights, one on Sunday.  And next Thursday, I'm in, uh, Miami at the South Beach Comedy Festival.  Very cool.  You're doing three shows on Saturday?  That's a fucking busy night, man.  Busy night.  That's very cool.  That's a lot of shows.  I don't believe so.  All right, it's time for line of the day.  We're going to get the fuck out of here. 
[03:45:00]  I know that day.  No, we need a minute.  No.  Why?  I need a minute.  Oh, I know.  My fucking, uh.  What?  You had a really good line, I guess.  No, I didn't.  Throw into the mix.  Or is it, uh.  Oh, boy.  What do we do?  We have to fill.  Let's do filler.  Like, we're not used to it.  We do five hours a day.  I know, but.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, how far away are we from it? 
[03:45:30]  How about I just, like, do the plug real slow?  Do the plug.  Oh, yeah.  That'll be good.  Line of the Day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  That's BodogFantasy.net.  Next year, don't forget to go to, anyone?  Uh, BodogFantasy.net.  Before you make your picks.  Always.  Why after?  That'd be silly.  And this year, one of our listeners picked up, you want to guess how much? 
[03:46:00]  Lucky listener.  One lucky listener, guess how much they won from BodogFantasy.net?  $6?  $6.  You're correct.  In the One Pick'em League.  Check out how you could win a trip to anyone.  Las Vegas.  Camden?  Camden.  Right for me.  Right now at BodogFantasy.net.  If you want that trip to Camden, New Jersey.  With $6, you could probably get fucking beachfront property in Camden.  Ha ha ha ha. 
[03:46:30]  Jimmy Tide didn't do well in the primary.  A lot of people ask him.  Jimmy Tide didn't do well because they douched him.  Yeah, Jimmy Tide in 08.  He said, I want clean shirts for all Americans.  That's right.  And they fucking drowned them out because they knew that that's the key.  By the way, I want to have a hat party.  Of course we're going to have a hat party.  Because Jimmy came up with a slogan that's sweeping the ONA community.  What is it again there, Jimmy?  Opie and Anthony, get your hat.  So we want people to get their hat.  Absolutely.  Get their hat. 
[03:47:00]  And we're going to have fucking Jack Rhodes come and remove it.  A good punch.  Yeah, that would be the...  We should have a hat walker party and Jack Rhodes punches all our hats off.  But Jimmy, you don't want regular hats, right?  You don't want the baseball caps.  I don't stand for regular hats.  You want a goofy hat.  And we want to have a hat party.  And you can't even come into it unless you're wearing your hat.  Because that's what we do now.  What do you think, Ralphie?  Get your hat.  I like it.  I like wearing a hat.  It's galvanizing.  I like hats.  I want pilgrim hats.  What kind of hat would you wear, Jimmy? 
[03:47:30]  A top hat.  A top hat.  I'm a gentleman.  Like Ozzy.  Yes.  Would you wear one of those?  I would want a stovepipe Abe Lincoln hat.  I want a Jughead hat.  Oh, one of those Jughead hats.  Yeah.  Anthony would want a hat with a little diamonds thing on his neck.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking from Oz.  What kind of hat would Jimmy wear?  Like an out of BC hat.  A Jimmy hat.  What's a Jimmy hat?  It's a condom.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  So a condom hat.  No, I'm kidding.  That's the last thing I'd ever wear.  Why am I wearing it?  At this point.  Why start now?  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  I had to have been exposed to everything.  I think you have to wear one of those.  Why switch to the filter?  There's no reason for it.  You have to wear one of those Ebeneezer Scrooge I'm going to bed hats.  Oh, I like those.  I think you would look good in one of those.  A night cap.  How about one of those Paul Revere hats?  You know, the three-tiered?  You're like a pirate right there, you know?  I prefer the sleepy Ebeneezer hat because I get sleepy a lot.  How about a raccoon cap?  No, the fur would be like a scalp itch.  No racial pun intended.  A coonskin cap?  How about like some kind of antler hat? 
[03:48:30]  Like you're part of the lodge.  Oh, I'd like that.  I'd like that.  How about one of those Eternal Water Buffalo from the Flintstone hats?  Yeah.  Big blue with the little horns.  I want to be part of a lodge.  Me too.  What kind of lodge would you be part of?  The Boy Fuckers Lodge.  What was the one on the Flintstones?  The Royal Order of Buffaloes.  Order of Water Buffaloes.  Water Buffaloes, right.  I hated that show.  The Flintstones?  I fucking hate the Flintstones. 
[03:49:00]  Because they ripped off the honeymooners.  But they never made me laugh.  Dear friend.  Shut up.  Fuck yourself.  A piece of meat.  Car tip's over.  They were ribs.  Yuck.  Stopped the car with his feet.  Fucking asshole.  Hated Fred Flintstones.  Always did.  Why?  I don't know.  I like the Flintstones.  Didn't like them at all.  He was just a regular guy.  Going to work and trying to make things work.  I like how Bugs Bunny kicked him out.  Yeah.  Bugs Bunny was fucking hilarious. 
[03:49:30]  Using dinosaurs for like machines.  And now, you know, Rock Quarry and...  I am Rock Quarry.  Bugs fucking...  But I am Rock Quarry.  Bugs Bunny needed his teeth kicked in, though.  Yeah, Bugs Bunny just shot in the face and shit.  A little too cocky, though, in general.  Maybe.  He always won in the end.  I didn't like that.  But there was shooting involved.  Elmer Fudd would blast your fucking face backwards.  Not anymore.  I didn't love that.  Not anymore.  You don't see that shooting crap anymore.  I know.  That's bad for the children.  A bunch of faggots we've turned into. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  What was wrong with the Flintstones, though?  You really haven't explained yourself.  Never made me laugh.  I just never...  Wilma?  Pretty hot.  Fuck Wilma.  What a stupid fucking hair.  Betty.  Betty?  Yeah, I'd have gone for Betty more.  Yeah.  Betty over Wilma?  Over Wilma.  I hate it.  Bam, bam.  Bam, bam.  Bam, bam, bam.  Right.  That's when it got real bad.  That's when it got bad.  I mean, that's like in color Andy Griffith's shows.  Yeah.  They stink.  Yeah, because the black and white ones were just so terrific.  I know.  I liked them a lot better. 
[03:50:30]  There was a million examples out there.  You went with that one?  But that's all.  I thought you were going to go with Oliver joining the Brave Bunch or something.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  Yeah, that's a bad one, too.  I love that one.  That's when the Andy Griffith show went to color.  Oh, my God.  That's me.  Robert Reed promised...  I love that show.  I'm from the South, man.  We had four stations.  It's all good, bro.  It's all good.  All right, there you go.  That's what we did.  See how we just kind of improv for everybody?  We didn't know we were going to do that.  Now we got line of the day ready?  Sure, I guess so.  Be blessed to make a wee-wee.  The first... 
[03:51:00]  What?  Oh, we're ready, right?  Yes.  First runner-up line of the day.  The new Hillary.  We've come tonight with a very, very full heart.  And a big ass.  Oh, God.  I want...  I want...  What was the line?  Cavs.  Yes.  Did Rafi just jump on the line of the day thing?  I think I just did.  I'm sorry.  He was reacting like it was just being played, though.  The audio.  I don't think he realized.  It was the obvious joke.  So what was the line?  Big ass? 
[03:51:30]  Cavs.  Cavs.  Cavs, yeah.  I did.  I come to you.  No, we don't need to play it again.  All right.  Of course not.  It's time for the next runner-up line.  Oh, no.  I'll shut up.  And I look basically more dirtbaggish than I usually do, which is, you know, semi-dirtbaggish.  Anyway, so...  I had a lot of time to kill the war.  I had to kill...  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  Wow.  The best part was to swallow after semi-dirtbaggish. 
[03:52:00]  That was fucking horrendous.  You could actually feel his finger actually pointing up on forward.  I'm...  Yeah.  It's fucking...  All right.  Here's another.  Another runner-up line of the day.  That's pretty good, man.  Very good.  Green legs and ham.  Oh, God.  That was good, too.  Mm-hmm.  Of course, they're all good.  They were the highlights of the show.  The final runner-up? 
[03:52:30]  No.  This is line of the day.  This is line of the day.  Oh, wow.  We're zipping through.  BowdogFentasy.net.  Thank you.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  BowdogFentasy.net.  I wanted to see if I was getting any more vascular definition in my legs from all the friggin' workouts I was doing.  Is that what you told yourself?  Here we are. 
[03:53:00]  You can't see muscles.  And you can see muscles better through pantyhose.  Are you Armenian?  Italian and Lebanese.  Italian and Lebanese.  Gregorio!  You can see muscles better through pantyhose.  I didn't even hear the line.  I all heard something, something, something.  Pantyhose.  Pantyhose.  I just kept laughing at pantyhose.  Steve and pantyhose.  All right.  Ralphie, thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  Bananas?  Yes.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie on Friday.  Three shows, Hesburgh Heights, Saturday and Sunday. 
[03:53:30]  And next week, Thursday, I'm at the South Beach Comedy Festival in Miami.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That's a good gig right there.  I'm working with Jeffrey Ross under the stupidest name in the history of comedy.  The meanest men in comedies.  What they put the show together as.  And I'm like, I'm not mean at all.  The meanest men in comedies should just be Vince Champ.  I'm there.  Does anybody know the reference?  Yeah.  Okay, all right.  The comedian that went around the country raping girls. 
[03:54:00]  Raping, yeah.  That's how everybody laughed.  He's on the silliest goose in comedy.  It certainly is.  What a sicko.  That guy should be getting out of jail soon.  He never should have been there.  He was obviously a good comic.  Made people laugh.  He was big on the college scene.  Of course he was.  He fucking knocked a few teeth out.  Comes with the territory.  Kidding, of course.  Bad men.  Bad men.  All right.  With that, bye.  Bye.  It's a pretty intense stuff, man.  If you do it, you will talk to intelligent beings from other dimensions. 
[03:54:30]  For real. </pre>
