<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with self-deprecating humor about their "shock jock" status and technical difficulties with their intro music.  The hosts recounted their weekends, focusing on Hurricane Hannah's impact, Anthony's Ferrari driving (including a fabricated claim of 100 mph in the Midtown Tunnel), and his frustrating experiences with online criticism regarding his dating life and relationships with younger women. This led to considerable, crude insults directed at his online critics.

The show transitioned to sports, discussing Tom Brady's injury, Brett Favre's performance, Michael Strahan's commentary, and listener anecdotes about knee injuries, alongside various other sports news items, including the Mets and Yankees.  A "Primetime Gossip" segment announced Anthony's planned 24-hour webcam show featuring multiple women, heavily emphasizing its sexually suggestive nature.  Humorous commentary followed on a Six Flags advertisement and continued complaints about online negativity on Paltalk.  Listener calls, a teased story from a previous show, further sports discussions, and the Cleveland sports curse were all featured.  The show concluded with fantasy football and Anthony's workout routine involving a "jiggle free abs" DVD.

The broadcast continued with a segment focusing on reckless driving, sparked by a caller – a Brooklyn Battery Tunnel officer – boasting about speeding tickets and revealing Anthony's Ferrari speeding admission.  This led to more anecdotes about Anthony’s driving and a repossessed Lexus.  The discussion shifted to the 2008 VMAs, focusing on Russell Brand's hosting, jokes about the Jonas Brothers and their chastity rings, Britney Spears' performance, and Dennis Leary's joke about Ricky Martin. This segued into an extensive debate on gun control, spurred by caller comments, covering gun laws in different states, the NRA, Obama’s stance, and the Second Amendment, including anecdotes and comparisons of firearms.  A young caller, J.C., shared his perspective on New Jersey gun laws, and a clip of Archie Bunker's commentary on gun control was played.

The next segment began with a discussion about seemingly unchanging societal problems and a documentary, *The Trials of Daryl Hunt*, highlighting racial bias in the justice system.  The conversation contrasted modern sensitivities with the actions of the Founding Fathers, leading to offensive speculation about their modern behavior.  Anthony again promoted his planned 24/7 webcam stream featuring young women, playing a comedic, sexually suggestive promo.  Commentary followed on Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl" video and Gary Coleman's altercation.  The segment concluded with lengthy discussions of recurring nightmares, including detailed descriptions from the hosts and a caller, an NRA instructor.  Jim Norton's website issues and Chuck Liddell's knockout loss were also briefly mentioned.

A caller's story about his sleepwalking sister initiated the next segment, followed by discussions of Hurricane Ike’s potential path, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout, and broader economic criticisms.  Numerous callers shared bizarre dreams, including plane crashes, sleepwalking confessions, midget trolls, and a recurring threesome dream.  George W. Bush's post-9/11 "shopping" suggestion, an MTV segment with Russell Brand endorsing Obama, and a purported "dream culture" in South and Central America were also discussed.  Callers complained about corporate taxes and ineffective stimulus checks.  The hosts discussed a box of scones sent by "Dr. Steve," a weekend get-together involving excessive drinking and a prank on a guest, Derek. A Ron & Fez intern, Frank, called in for a playful interview, followed by a couple celebrating a birthday.  The show ended with commentary on Keith Olbermann's firing from MSNBC.

The final segment began with discussion of a fired radio host (possibly Don Imus) and a listener's misspelling of a Keith Olbermann word.  This led to criticism of a staff member, "Hip Hop Ron," for not wearing shoelaces, resulting in a Pussycat Dolls song performance.  Eastside Dave's suspension was discussed, with pleas for financial support.  The segment included off-color jokes, a caller's bizarre encounter with a man and his drugged wife, vulgar jokes about cuckoldry, more listener calls, and jokes about O.J. Simpson, fainting goats, an angry cat video, and a pug running into a TV.  Profanity and sexually explicit humor were prevalent throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  It has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, I'm going to start breaking stuff.  Seriously.  Watch this.  All right.  Now we need a new one.  Now we need a new one.  Oops.  Just slow in there.  All right, and now Pat's blowing.  Wait, no, not yet.  Hold on.  Please, hurry.  Ready?  Yes.  I wanted you to smell it if it smells like Elio's pizza.  That's all. 
[00:01:00]  No, I, that's all we're asking.  I can't have it.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Hold on, everybody.  Oh, shh.  There she goes.  Go.  Holy crap.  It's more than just your life you're hurting.  Think about your family.  Think about your friends.  Think beyond the moment.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  How was that?  The end of my video demo.  No, I mean, why is the music going so fast?  It's like in fast motion.  That is not our opener.  And that's the new CD player, How to Buy.  That's better.  Hey, wait a minute.  But now I'm slow.  Wait a minute. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning.  That sounded a little odd.  I just thought it was a new version.  I don't know.  I thought the boys were spicing it up a bit.  It was.  That's all you got to do.  There, new version.  Yeah.  It's the fast version.  Well, it's Monday.  Monday.  Look.  It looks like someone's got a case on Mondays.  Yeah.  Had half a weekend.  That was nice.  One half was nice and sunny and fun. 
[00:02:30]  But that half, you know, you got to kind of cash in early because you got to get up for work.  And Saturday sucked.  Rainy here in New York.  We have the remnants of, what was it, Hannah?  I guess.  Hurricane Hannah.  Yeah.  Off the coast of Long Island.  It wasn't bad.  I mean, they were making a big to-do of it on the news, of course.  Like it was going to be some huge thing.  A little bit of wind.  A lot of rain.  And just generally, ugh. 
[00:03:00]  Couldn't do anything.  You're saying it wasn't bad because you were inside probably, right?  No.  I was outside under my little patio awning thing.  Wasn't it raining sideways right into that?  Well, yeah.  A couple of times the wind blew and whew.  Yeah.  I was at my cousin's wedding Saturday, Cousin Billy, and trying to get to your car after  the wedding in your nice clothes was not fun.  Yeah.  And then the wedding was way out east on Long Island, so now you're driving all the way 
[00:03:30]  home completely soaked.  It was impossible to avoid.  In the rain.  In the rain.  Yeah.  Yeah, which is always fun.  Not much traffic when you're driving in the rain from out east.  No.  Jesus.  Did you wear white suit pants with no underwear?  Yeah.  A boy's a dream.  See-through clothes, man.  Like linen suit pants with no underpants.  I had a light dress.  See, it was a big splotch. 
[00:04:00]  I had a light dress shirt on, so I guess you could see some of my hairy nipples through  my shirt.  Jeepers.  Damn rain.  How was Supercar Weekend?  I know you were showing off your Ferrari on Friday.  Well, it was a fun drive home, obviously, and then Saturday was a wash.  Why was it a fun...  How could it be a fun ride home on a Friday?  A Ferrari going 45 miles an hour is not fun.  You know something?  It wasn't that bad, the traffic, once I got out of town and then was able to kind of open 
[00:04:30]  it up a few times.  That was fun.  And then Saturday, again, sucked.  Rainy.  I think it just sat in my driveway.  And then Sunday was a lot of fun on the Meadowbrook Parkway.  Say hi to a couple of motorcycle guys that we were kind of just having some fun there  on the Meadowbrook.  But then this morning I had to bring it back into the city.  And I got to tell you, 100 through the Midtown Tunnel is an exciting life.  It's like a live action video game because those cones are just going by you real fast. 
[00:05:00]  The wall's right next to you.  For the people that...  Taking those curves, it's like, whoa, this is cool.  I just want to jump in for a second.  For the people that live elsewhere, this Midtown Tunnel, the lanes are really, really narrow.  Yeah.  So that's got to be just insane to do 100 in that.  The car's narrow, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, a little Ferrari spider.  Oh, so you got a little more room than the average car on each side.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And it sounds unbelievable in there. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  When you goose it, it just, the sound of the engine echoing in the tunnel is just adrenaline.  It's great.  Should you be telling New York City that you went 100 miles an hour in the Midtown Tunnel?  It's for the show.  It's a lie.  It's just a show.  That means it's going 120.  It's just for the show I do it.  I was doing 40 miles an hour, as the speed limit states, when both lanes are open.  Well, yeah.  That's keeping it safe.  Of course.  10 and 2.  10 and 2, right?  10 and 2. 
[00:06:00]  10 and 2 all the way.  Exactly.  Anything else happen over the weekend?  Well, not exactly parties, but they were kind of just like...  Get-togethers?  Yeah, like people would stop by and then leave, and then other people would stop by on another  day.  Yet, we just continued it through the entire weekend.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was pretty fun.  That's cool.  Just sitting in.  Saturday, again, a washout.  But that didn't stop just sitting outside at a table and drinking beer all day. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Because that's what you do.  It was a lot of fun.  The jacuzzi was very hot, Jimmy.  Did you go in the rain, too?  You missed that.  Yeah.  There was some jacuzziing in the rain.  That's kind of fun, man.  Yeah.  You ever like jacuzzi in the middle of winter with the snow coming down?  Oh, might have to do that.  That, you should keep the jacuzzi open for that.  That's, that's, that's very cool.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  Definitely.  But you got to do the run from the house into the jacuzzi.  I want to get some heaters under the awning there, outside, out back. 
[00:07:00]  Some of those, you know, ever walk into a hotel?  Oh, the restaurant heaters?  Under the awning, like, they got those electric heaters that just heat the whole area up?  Yeah.  I want to do that.  Or just get the restaurant heaters.  You could get four.  One on each, you know, corner.  What, like freestanding?  Yeah, those things.  Oh, boy.  Those things rock.  I, I realized freestanding stuff, not a good idea.  I almost had a napalm explosion, uh, last night when Danny drunkenly teetered into one  of my tiki torches and tipped it over.  I thought it was going to explode. 
[00:07:30]  And then he didn't know what to do, so he just looked at it for a while before he picked  it up.  Oh, I thought he just walked away.  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  I let Keith clean it up.  Let Keith get the fire hose out.  How to hose it down.  And deal with this.  Very good.  Are you closer to the webcam idea?  Uh, well, let me tell you, uh, uh, we pretty much had three cameras running last night.  Just kind of, uh, you know, surveying the scene. 
[00:08:00]  Just trying it out.  On, uh, on Pal Talk.  Yeah, nothing really going on.  But I've had, you know, jacuzzi cam and pool cam, things like that.  So that's the start, really.  Just feeling it out.  That's the start.  Yeah.  People tune in and then say awful things for some reason, because I guess they're jealous.  What are they saying?  I don't know.  There's some people that just don't like, uh, don't like me.  You know how message boards are on Pal Talk 3.  What could they possibly be saying that's bad? 
[00:08:30]  Um, apparently they, for some reason, it's very concerning to certain people that, um,  I am, uh, my age, and, uh, you know, girls I see are their age.  Mm-hmm.  And it really seems to upset people.  Why?  Like, some people get upset.  Dude, you think I got an answer for that?  They're jealous.  Because they're, uh, probably stuck with dimpled ass old bitches that, uh, they can't get away from. 
[00:09:00]  So they pick at me.  They pick, pick.  And I just laugh.  I go, yeah, that's right.  You're enjoying your life.  Young enough to be my daughter.  And unfortunately, she's not.  It's like we like to say, 20 is funny, 30 is dirty.  One guy was trying to C-block me.  He's like, he's talking to, uh, you know, the mystery girl. 
[00:09:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, what a mystery that is.  And saying, uh, and I'm just reading, because, uh, and he apparently thinks there's some private  communique going on.  But I'm, I'm reading the whole thing.  And he's like, well, you're with an unstable millionaire.  It's like, yeah, you could have done better or picked, uh, picked something better than an  unstable millionaire.  So I just start going, ha, ha, unstable millionaire, ha, ha, ha, ha, go, screw. 
[00:10:00]  What, is it some douche and pal talk?  Yeah, just trying to C-block, and, you know, the C-blocking phase is over, dude.  Don't even try.  But it's like, had to throw that in, trying to, like, undermine me.  Why?  Right in front of my face.  And I was just like, oh, what a pathetic douche.  And I guarantee you that you doing better would have been him, the guy on pal talk, watching the camera. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That would have been the better one.  It's just these, it seems to be people that know every single aspect of what's going on, or think they do.  You know, they know the show, they listen to it every day.  They're on pal talk all the time.  And then they talk about how you're just a douche.  They don't like you.  They don't like what you're doing.  Uh, uh, I'm creepy.  Uh, it's just all kinds of things. 
[00:11:00]  And it's like, well, why are you so concerned?  Like, what's the big concern with what I'm doing in my personal life?  What's creepy about a guy who wants to hang with, let's be, let's be frank here.  Yeah.  Wants to hang with hot, younger chicks.  Right.  They're of age.  What's the other guy who wants to hang with chicks who are 22?  I mean, look at Tony Randall married a girl like a third his age when he was 70 and had, what's the matter with people?  They, it's, and I'm convinced, and it sounds like one of those cop-out answers, but I'm convinced it's because they're not. 
[00:11:30]  That's very, I think that's very upsetting.  And then I kind of turned it around to myself and I'm thinking, you know, if I had a look in on what's going on with me, I guess if I was some guy at my computer all the time just keeping tabs, I'd be pissed at me too.  But you don't really have a personal life because you live it on pal talk.  Well, pal talk and on the air, but let me tell you something.  Then people feel like they could comment because, you know what I mean, it's not private.  It's right there for everyone.  I'm just playing the other side.  I know, but everything isn't on the air. 
[00:12:00]  Not saying it's right what this guy was doing, but I think he assumes he could say whatever the hell he wants because you're showing everyone your personal life.  He can, but like anyone can.  But the thing is, it's like there's the personal life and then there's the open personal life that, you know, I put out there that you're able to see.  Not every aspect of my life is open for public viewing.  I keep things, you know, hidden.  I keep things under wraps, but they hear you on the show. 
[00:12:30]  They hear you, you know, on pal talk.  They see you on pal talk and think that's 100% of who you are.  So they comment on things and talk about, you know.  It's pretty close.  What a douche.  It's pretty close.  I'm not saying it's real close.  You don't want to show them.  It's probably a 99.9% accurate.  I was going to say, okay.  Who are you kidding?  You're basically trying to say, well, I don't show them when I'm going to church every Sunday morning or, you know, doing my charity work.  It's pretty close. 
[00:13:00]  Who are you kidding?  No, it's just, I guess the thing is, especially with like relationships, for some reason there's some kind of thing going on with people in pal talk where these guys that are trying to see block.  I noticed a couple of them are saying things like, well, you know, Anthony's got some kind of, you know, reputation.  He's known for this kind of thing.  And then I sit there and go, known for being in a steady relationship since 1988 between like three girls where it's been, you know, none of them has lasted less than eight years. 
[00:13:30]  And that's me being man about town.  I wish I was screwing everything when I was, when I was in those relationships.  You're just making up for lost time.  I'm six months out of the gate dating.  Right.  And all of a sudden I'm a predator because these asses can't get their own quiff. 
[00:14:00]  It's been six months.  Quim, whatever you want to call it.  It's been six months.  About that, I guess.  More or less.  Probably.  Maybe.  Maybe even a little longer, but, but it's like.  And it went from a long marriage to a long relationship.  And he's been single for six months.  Six months out of frigging, one was nine, one was eight.  The 17 years I sat back and was a loyal guy, not touching anything on the internet or any websites or pal talk or anything like that. 
[00:14:30]  And then all of a sudden I decide, you know something?  Listen, I'm not going to get in a relationship relationship.  I'm going to, you know, go out.  I'm going to have some fun.  I'm going to meet people.  I'm going to do that.  Whatever.  And then I got to listen to C blockers chiming in to, to everyone and girls and stuff on pal talk.  Talking about what, oh, that's the kind of guy he is.  Why don't you just F your mother?  She's upstairs. 
[00:15:00]  She's calling you for dinner soon.  Let me tell you something.  There's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than the concerned guy friend.  And a scumbag, you think you're dealing with it?  Believe me, the last person I dated, the scumbag concerned guy friend.  Yep.  Well, you know, you don't want him to be like this with you if he's like this with other people.  Really?  Exactly.  Really, guy friend?  Guy friend.  Shut your mouth.  You know what it is, too?  Not one girl has come forward and given me crap about this or talked to any girls saying, 
[00:15:30]  well, you're going to watch out for him.  It's all these guys, just dopey guys on message boards and pal talk and other things where it's  like, you know, just shut up.  Get out of your house and try to do something.  That's why I stay clear of all that because I can't.  I can't.  I have to.  I mean, I literally can't.  You know, I'm invited.  I stay clear of the message boards, the pal talk. 
[00:16:00]  Dude, there are plenty of people that are really cool on there.  Right.  That are like, just want to have fun, just want to, but then it's such a small minority  that just you read and go like, ugh, what's your issue?  Like, I want to know what the issue is.  What's confusing is, are they really fans of the show if they're doing that?  I don't know.  You know something?  They probably are.  They're in the Opie and Anthony world, basically, in these pal talk rooms.  It's their entire life. 
[00:16:30]  Dude, their entire life revolves around this show and the people they're in.  Yeah.  Because they're constantly on and constantly talking crap.  So, yeah, their life revolves around the show and our lives and trying to dig up little  personal things that, meanwhile, aren't personal at all.  Look what I'm on to.  Oh, really?  Look what I screen capped.  Look what I vid capped on pal talk. 
[00:17:00]  I saw the camera and the light on.  I think, you know, I was pretty on.  It wasn't a hidden camera in someone's glasses.  That's a good point.  You know?  You're talking in code.  You should bring a little more, some more people to the party here.  Yeah, some guy.  Girl at my house.  Right.  We're hanging out and I'm like rubbing her leg and shoulder in front of the cam.  She's sitting on your lap.  At one point, yeah.  But for the most part, she was sitting in a chair next to me.  And some guy thought he found, you know. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God!  And you're making a good point by saying, I knew the camera was on.  It's my house.  It's my computer.  It's my camera.  I turned it on.  It's not the paparazzo.  Yeah.  From a tree, like a mile away, you know, capturing this.  Check this out!  Look what I discovered.  This is what I do in my backyard.  Just.  But it's not just.  And it was fully aware of what he was doing.  Yes!  But people are making a big deal out of that.  Yes, Jim.  It's not just pal talk. 
[00:18:00]  It's just a guy thing.  Yep.  You're right.  This guy friend mentality.  This, she's like my sister.  I'm concerned.  Open your veins in a tub.  Yeah.  Be honest with yourself and be honest with the girl.  You're either A, in love with her, or B, you want to have sex with her, which is fine  on both accounts.  Uh-huh.  But be honest about that.  Don't worm around like you're just a good guy.  None of us are that.  Exactly.  And it's never with a fat chick or an ugly pig of a chick.  It's always with a beautiful girl.  Always. 
[00:18:30]  Guy friend is douche.  I know exactly.  Like, there are things in my, girls in my past that had the guy friend thing.  And I was always, I was always kind of, at one point I'd be like, you know, I don't  trust that guy.  Oh, he's nice.  He's like, oh, don't be stupid.  And then the second you have a problem or you do break up, where are they?  Of course.  Guy friend.  Yeah.  Right down to the chest, right down to the lap. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Have fun.  Guy friend is the world.  And I've been to guy friend.  Have fun with guy friend.  Hey.  Hey.  Somebody wants to know if the exchange took place because they want to hear the quote  story that you hinted about on Friday.  No, exchange didn't take place.  I had the Ferrari.  What am I going to do?  Pick crap up?  Oops.  Pick crap up and take it over there?  Yeah.  Well, you teased a good story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one.  Someday.  All right.  Oh, boy.  That's a Lulu.  With other people, make sure he doesn't do it with you. 
[00:19:30]  Ugh.  Shut up, guy friend.  Just die, guy friend.  Guy friend is an ass loser who should just die.  Hate guy friend.  Oh, guy friend stinks.  Always trying a C block when you're already in.  Yeah.  It's like, just enough.  What?  You couldn't close the deal.  So move on, guy friend. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Message board jackass.  That should be the person's name, guy friend.  Yeah.  My name's guy friend.  Is it?  They're the worst.  They are the worst.  I'm snorting.  All right.  And these are the idiots that just come up to you at gigs.  And don't say their little, cute little message board or pal talk name.  Hi, I'm, you know, I'm Pete or something.  And it's like, oh, and then you shake their hand. 
[00:20:30]  And meanwhile, that's the ass that, you know, needs a thrashing.  Oof.  They're just the worst.  All right.  That's a good start to a final show.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-018.  We can continue after the break.  We got a lot of sports to talk about after the break.  The VMAs, if you care.  There's no real highlights.  No.  And other things, of course.  Obama made a little bit of a mistake over the weekend.  We got that audio.  That's a biggie. 
[00:21:00]  Do we have the article that they sent us on that?  The language in the article, I read it.  Yeah, I'm sure we have it.  Thank you so much.  As we go to break, we got primetime gossip.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back with another pulse-pounding rendition of Primetime Gossip.  Recently on the Opie and Anthony show,  overweight comedian Bob Kelly came in to say hi to the host of the show  and to create an uncomfortable situation for everyone.  I went from one to another to another.  And no, I won't have it anymore. 
[00:21:30]  You and your girl are still together.  What?  You done?  Hello?  Awkward.  Huh?  Awkward.  Sorry, dude.  While we have no idea what he was referring to,  that wasn't the O&A news of the day.  The real buzz kicked in when Anthony let the audience in  on his latest media endeavor.  Reality programming is phony.  I just want the real deal.  See, this has to be me and six to eight girls.  And that's it?  Yes!  That's right.  A 24-hour webcam show centered around Anthony and his kinky sex antics. 
[00:22:00]  This will be the real deal.  Reality programming where it's just me with a bunch of chicks living at my house.  However, Anthony's focus may not be on women alone.  Everything is done in bra and panties, by the way.  Yes, even me.  I'll be in bra and panties the whole time.  Will Anthony's bisexual drag queen sex party romp be a hit?  Stay tuned as you get all the information from Primetime Gossip. 
[00:22:30]  Um, what is that?  What the hell is that crap?  What is that?  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony's show.  Yuck.  Hmm.  Yuck.  I'm not feeling this.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck. 
[00:23:00]  I don't know what this is.  Ah, whatever.  We gotta be, um, extra nice to Boston today.  They had a tough day yesterday, man.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine being Tom Brady right now?  You lose the Super Bowl and an undefeated season.  That's gotta kill you inside.  And then the whole offseason, you just want to get back in there and start winning again.  Yeah.  And start marching toward another Super Bowl. 
[00:23:30]  First game out.  Out for the season.  Out for the season.  With that damn ACL injury.  Why can't they figure that ACL thing out?  That's ending a lot of people's careers.  It certainly is.  You would think there would be some kind of a side brace that is, I don't know, that allows  him mobility.  It just takes out too many great athletes.  So he's out for the season.  He's gotta be out of his freaking mind.  Hard to feel bad for him.  He doesn't have to work and he gets to bang Giselle. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, he's flat on his back.  Not a bad position to be in.  Ankle up in the air.  You gotta think though, even though he's banging her and he's got all the money in the world,  the most important thing to this guy is to throw that football and win Super Bowls.  Yeah.  In the end, I betcha.  He's gotta be just out of his mind.  And they're looking for a new quarterback.  And Anthony was joking, Vinny!  Where's Vinny Testaverde?  Vinny, this is the job for Vinny Testaverde.  Bring him in.  Vinny's gonna play until he's like 52 years old. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, I know he's retired right now, but some team will pick him up again this year.  That'd be hysterical.  Just so they have somebody, you know, that could take the snaps.  Bring him.  But what about Flutie?  Flutie!  Bring in Doug Flutie.  Yeah, Flutie was the guy for a while.  Yeah.  But, wow.  But they still won.  How long does it take that to heal that ACL?  A year minimum.  He is done.  Done.  What do they do?  Do they do surgery on it immediately?  In his case, yeah, I'm sure. 
[00:25:00]  I'm sure.  That's a year, right?  Easy.  Then Tiger Woods is going through that crap.  Where's the ACL?  It's in your ankle?  Or your calf?  No, the knee.  Yeah, so.  The knee, man.  Did you see the video of his knee getting twisted?  I did see that, yeah.  Oh, a knee's not supposed to twist that way.  You know what, though?  I didn't hear one.  Ah!  Ah!  I broke my knee, man.  Hold my hand.  He wasn't telling it like his coach.  Hold my hand, coach.  Hold my hand. 
[00:25:30]  Shows you what a wuss that Bobby Kelly is.  See, I would like to...  He took a torn ACL like a man.  I think he's a wuss for other reasons, but I don't know.  I mean, none of us have broken our knee before.  I can't imagine that's a fun pain.  It's got hurt.  I think he would say all sorts of crazy stuff if you broke your knee.  Ah!  Ah!  There's the video.  Ah!  Is that a broken knee, or is it just when something tears off the bone?  It's a tear.  It's a...  Yeah, he's...  But he's walking off the field, but still.  I mean, you know.  Walking and playing are two different things. 
[00:26:00]  Football players are real men, though.  He did just walk...  I don't care how he did it.  He walked off the field.  He walked off.  He's limping.  He's being helped a little bit.  But, yeah, he walked off the field.  I don't want to be dragged by my bag before I walk.  Less painful.  Yeah.  Put it over your shoulder like Santa Claus.  And then Brett Favre, yeah, he looked all right for the Jets.  He's in the season opener over the Dolphins.  Yeah, a little sloppy, ugly victory there.  But, like he said, a win's a win. 
[00:26:30]  A couple sloppy touchdown passes, I do believe.  At least one, anyway.  But that guy can throw the friggin' ball.  Holy Jesus.  He can still throw that long, long spiral.  Yep.  So they beat the Dolphins, the Jets.  And then you got Michael Strahan just doing a little quick little football roundup here.  He's retired from the Giants, and he's now a color commentator.  And he went on TV yesterday, and Giants fans are very pissed off  because he said that the Cowboys are the best team, 
[00:27:00]  and he's predicting the Cowboys are going to win it all this year.  Really?  Man, he's trying not to sound like he's rooting for his old team.  Yeah.  Ah, the Giants-Cowboys rivalry is pretty intense there, Jimmy.  You would think he would just shut his mouth and go,  I'm not really sure right now.  I'll get back to you on that.  Giants ain't paying the bills.  The commentator people are.  Well, he wants to be a good commentator.  I bet you he doesn't want his team to win without him.  You know, now that he's retired, he's hoping they go,  well, they already won, right?  So, one in whatever.  One in 15.  I mean, let's say hi to Nick in D.C. 
[00:27:30]  Nick.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  You must not be listening to the news reports because another player on the team  reported that he heard Brady yell out in pain when it happened.  He screamed.  Yeah, I think.  Well, I'm sure the second it happens, you're going to go, ah!  I'm sure it didn't sound like our buddy Bobby Kelly,  but it certainly was a scream from what I heard.  Yeah.  Take care, guys.  Hey, speaking of, at least this Brady will get well. 
[00:28:00]  It's a ruined ACL, not ASS.  Let's go to Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Yo, buddy.  Good morning, Joe.  I remember I broke my knee in high school, man,  and the very next morning I woke up in excruciating pain,  and I didn't know why, and I realized it was because the bed sheet was on my knee.  Really?  The bed sheet.  The heavy bed sheet.  Wow.  That's got to hurt. 
[00:28:30]  Two athletes were just painful as all hell.  How long until you got surgery?  How long did you just, like, what's the normal, like, time?  Before I could even, like, start running normally again, it was almost a full year.  No, no, no.  How long until you get surgery?  Is it something you have to let heal, like, you get it immediately?  Well, the athletes get it done immediately because they want to, you know,  try to be back as soon as possible, so.  Yeah.  You still have to wait for the swelling to go down, and that takes easily almost a week.  I would imagine that if, you know, if they're operating on Brady and all that,  that it'll be within the next couple of days.  They waited months for the swelling to go down on Bobby and then realized it wasn't swelling. 
[00:29:00]  It's just his knee.  Thank God it wasn't a stomach operation.  It'd still be there.  Put ice on it.  Kelly, it's four years.  Now I did.  All right.  Hey, there was another knee injury over the weekend.  Someone from the Philly crew.  Really?  I heard a crazy story yesterday.  Trish from the Philly crew.  She's at a wedding, right?  And she was running away from rats after this wedding.  And so was the wedding?  You got to run away from rats. 
[00:29:30]  Somehow they got.  Based by Washington Square Park.  Somehow they got in a situation where there were rats after this wedding.  And she was running away from the rats, completely freaked out, saw a curb,  and thought it was just a little step-down curb, and it wasn't.  It dropped down about four feet, four or five feet.  She broke her kneecap in half.  In half!  Now that's another one that's really got to hurt.  Can you imagine breaking your kneecap in half? 
[00:30:00]  Wait, she thought it was a curb, and it was four and a half to five feet?  Yeah.  How?  Well, it was dark.  You know.  There may have been some booze.  I don't know.  But it was definitely dark, and she thought she was stepping over just a regular curb.  She was somewhere she's never been before, so she didn't know the territory.  And then fell right on her kneecap.  And then was crying all night long, and her lovely boyfriend had no idea that she might  have a real problem.  And then went to the hospital the next day to discover she broke her kneecap in half. 
[00:30:30]  Can she walk fine now?  She's got like a ridiculous cast on, yeah.  Oh, she still has it?  This just happened, like two days ago.  Yeah, they got to, what, immobilize your knee?  Yeah.  It's pretty much, you cannot even budge, so they cast that thing up from your toe to your  friggin' hip.  Yeah, it's not a good one.  It's not a good injury to have.  It's horrible.  I hope they don't dump out of this, but that's got to hurt like heck.  Oh, oof.  Easy.  And then I was trying to relate.  I was telling my girl, I'm like, you know, when I was playing basketball, I would bang 
[00:31:00]  knees every once in a while.  Man, that hurts like a mother.  And she yells at me.  She's like, it's not the same.  She broke her kneecap in half.  You got your knee banged.  Is there anything worse than when you've, believe me, we've all done it, where you're  just trying to shoehorn yourself into a story and you realize, I am a self-obsessed.  Yeah, it doesn't even compare to what the person has just told me.  Dude, if you watch the Kennedy assassination, one time I stood up, I didn't see the cabinet  door open. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, we all do that, though.  You're so right.  Let's say hi to Margaret in Jersey.  Margaret in Jersey wants to call Brady a what?  A wuss.  That's right.  A wuss.  A wuss.  The guy, I mean, come on now.  You're wasting your energy talking about him first thing in the morning.  I listen to you guys, like, every morning, and this guy is just, he's a waste.  It's kind of big news, though, that the guy that, you know, led his team pretty much undefeated  during the season, and then he breaks his knee like that. 
[00:32:00]  It's the top sports story.  Obviously, you're either a Giants or a Jets fan, but, you know, we're live in Boston right  now, and they're not going to be happy with you, Margaret.  I don't, well, you know, something I understand that it can.  I don't like Tom Brady at all, but he's the best quarterback in football.  You're going to say he's not.  He is.  Not anymore.  Well, no, now he's probably, no, he's, whatever. 
[00:32:30]  I ran out of steam, but.  Yeah, that's just a drag.  And then, quickly, the Mets held off to Philly, so they're two games ahead in first place.  They're holding on, barely.  A lot of Mets fans remember last year that it was a complete disaster this time last year.  Yes, this is when the self-destruction started.  So we're all just kind of biting our freaking nails the last couple weeks of the season here.  Don't you do it!  Just hoping they can hold on.  Yeah.  And then you've got your Yankees now. 
[00:33:00]  Next to last place for you Yankee fans.  All right.  Eight and a half games back in the wild card.  In the wild card.  Wild card.  With $200 million payroll.  There you go.  That's good.  Stupids.  Nice.  There you go.  Douches.  And then, finally, I was telling Anthony just before the show, you know, when there's  anniversaries like this day in history, when it's stuff that happened a long time ago,  like, you know, the Kennedy assassination, or just pick some weird event.  Yeah.  It doesn't really bother you.  It's the ones that are kind of closer, that really freak you out, and make you feel very 
[00:33:30]  old, and make you realize, like, Anthony driving through the Midtown Tunnel a hundred miles  an hour in a Ferrari, that's what your life is doing.  Yeah.  Just imagine the Midtown Tunnel is your life, and time is the Ferrari.  Oh, slow down.  Yeah, exactly.  Geez.  A hundred miles an hour in the tunnel.  You're crazy.  Guess what happened ten years ago today?  This is going to freak out people, and it's going to make them feel like, holy yes, I am old,  or getting old fast. 
[00:34:00]  1998.  Ten years ago today.  Ten years ago.  It's a sports thing.  Ant knows already, and Jimmy knows, so.  I was playing it off like I didn't know I'm going, let me think.  I actually, no.  I would swear this thing was five years ago, six maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Can I guess?  Even though 1998 was a very important year in sports, but.  I want to guess.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  Jackie Robinson.  Ten years ago. 
[00:34:30]  First night game.  The White Sox threw the series.  Boo.  Shoeless Joe.  Mark McGuire breaks Roger Maris' single season home run record ten effing years ago.  That means, you know, rookies that started in 98, their careers are half over already.  Are half over.  Well, more than half over.  Does that make you feel old?  Doesn't that seem like that's five, six years ago, maybe? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Ten effing years ago.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Back to the Tom Brady thing.  Can you imagine all the fantasy football geeks that are just.  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  I got the first pick.  I got Tom Brady.  I'm so in, dude.  That fantasy football is just rocking, man.  Taking over the world.  Well, it's like a.  What's the service.  There's a, there's a service that, uh, it's like a football package and you can put all 
[00:35:30]  your players in.  Really?  And then it'll alert you when your player did something really, really good in one of the  games.  So you could really just keep, you know.  You say you don't have to do anything.  Keep updated as you're watching, you know, whatever game you're watching.  Or possibly even gives you the option to go to that play.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe someone can help me out with that.  I was, I was watching a commercial for this.  I couldn't believe it.  I don't know why I hate fantasy football.  I wish I didn't.  I just hate the concept of it.  Really?  I don't know why.  It's too, um.  Like a whole team.  Clicky and culty. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Dude, I took this.  I gotta tell you, it's way more than culty.  There's a lot of effing guys playing the fantasy football.  A lot.  Not my cup of tea.  No.  More a video game guy.  You're playing fantasy life.  All five young chicks.  Fantasy life.  Yeah.  Dude.  Who you got with a million?  Ferraris and whatever the hell you're doing.  Guns.  Guns.  Ferraris.  Young bra.  Fast women, fast cars, guns, and booze. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I'm living like a 30s movie star.  Yeah.  You really are.  You're like Rudy Valentino without the charm.  Yes.  With zero charm.  Let's say hi to Tom in Boston listening on BCN.  Tom, sorry about Brady there, buddy.  Yeah.  It happens.  It's a pretty bad day here in Boston.  What was the headline in the paper?  Well, it's today.  What am I saying?  I would love to see the headline in the Boston papers today.  It shows Brady's leg straight and the helmet going right into it. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That sucks.  I just want to let all the Jets fans and the Giants fans know this is your only chance that  you're going to win again.  Here he goes.  There we go.  There we go.  What was the excuse with the Super Bowl then?  You know, that happened last year, man, but I'm telling you, dude, Matt Castle isn't going  to do it.  My football season's over.  You know, I know you guys are...  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Do we all remember when Paul Pierce left during the NBA championship and then he came back 
[00:37:30]  out flying?  If you don't think we're going to see Tom Brady again this year, you're crazy, but I  think it's just going to be a little too late.  Yeah, you'll see him there like during an eight and eight season, you're sitting on  the sidelines waving.  Yeah.  With his legs straight in a cast.  I hope you break your mouth, Jimmy, dude.  I'm getting sick of your mouth already.  Are you?  Why, sir?  He does, dude.  All you do, you flap your gums, you do this, you do that, man.  You know, it's awesome.  Flap your gums.  All right, Grandpa.  That was not a good summary. 
[00:38:00]  I break my mouth, I flap my gums, I do this, I do that.  Sir, do this and do that.  You're not being specific.  They're very upset.  I mean, Brady's on the front page and the sports page today.  I just said he was the best quarterback in football, you dope.  The headline in the sports section says, one, as in W-O-N, and done.  One game in a football season is over.  Dude.  One game.  I know you guys.  Five plays.  Hold on.  I just want to say this there, Tom.  I know you guys up there in Boston have sort of gotten out of the sports curse, but you  guys have some weird things happening up there, man, with your teams. 
[00:38:30]  Real strange things.  Go undefeated, then lose the Super Bowl, and then Brady turns around and he's out for  the season, first game out.  That is some weird sports curse crap.  I don't care.  They say the sports curse is over and the Red Sox finally did away with that.  That is just a weird sports town.  There's stuff that happens to you guys.  Let's not forget Len Bias.  I mean, dropping dead.  You guys, it's scary to play sports in Boston.  You don't know what's going to happen.  Yeah, I mean, the worst part about the Super Bowl is that we got beat by Eli. 
[00:39:00]  Not even Peyton.  It was Eli.  He sucks.  Yeah.  He sucks.  All right, man.  And by the way, Jimmy Norton can beat Tom Brady in a foot race right now.  That's right.  So, go screw.  That's right.  I'll dance circles around him.  Right.  I cut a rug.  All right.  Hold on.  Rick in Pennsylvania.  But laying down, he could probably still throw a better pass. 
[00:39:30]  With his bad foot.  They'll just wheel him around in a wheelchair out on the field.  If he grabbed it between his toe and other, his big toe and other toe next to it and just  throw it, it would probably be more effective than my girl's arm.  Jimmy, you watching Cowboys yesterday?  I did not.  I was keeping it on the score on the computer.  I was at NFL.com.  I kept checking.  Yeah, they beat the Browns 28-10.  You got the Eagles beating the Rams 38-3.  Wow.  We got Rick in Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just want to tell you, when I was in high school playing football, I ripped my 
[00:40:00]  ACL once.  We were doing sprints back and forth.  Yeah.  And when it ripped, my kneecap went totally to the left side of my leg and the bottom part  of my leg completely turned around, so the front of my foot was facing backwards.  It was the worst feeling thing I've ever had in my life.  And how long before you were jogging?  Jogging?  It was a good, like, eight months.  I was on crutches for, like, six to seven months.  Yeah, this is a bad one.  You don't come back from this ACL thing. 
[00:40:30]  How old is he, Tom Brady?  He's still young, right?  Yeah.  What is he, around 30 now, finally?  A little older, maybe?  Could be.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  No problem.  Let's go to Al in New York.  Al!  Al!  Hello, Al!  Why don't you talk to us, Al?  Yeah, Brady's 31.  Very good.  Al, what up?  Giants, man, New York.  That little Patriots ran. 
[00:41:00]  Stopped his whining.  We probably loosened up his knee in the Super Bowl.  He has a body in the damn Super Bowl.  I loosened it for you.  That's why I love that we're live in Boston and New York at the same time.  You get two completely different.  Oh, they hate each other.  Oh, it's great.  The rivalry.  Yeah, a lot of people happy down here in New York.  A lot of people not happy in Boston.  Simple as that.  And Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  He's good for one.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Come on, Pash, man. 
[00:41:30]  The Jets went through it in 98-99.  98 with one game from the Super Bowl.  99, Testaverde goes down at a first play in a first game.  That was the same team coming back to win the Super Bowl.  All right.  All right.  A little sports history.  Well, that one sucked.  All right, man.  Yes, it did.  Wyatt, it was a really cool point you were talking about there.  It just takes one call to stop the set. 
[00:42:00]  The flow.  The set.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, we're going to talk about Obama messing up  and how to be corrected by the...  Corrected.  And Oprah...  Perhaps a bit more.  And Oprah refuses to have Sarah Palin on her show.  Because?  I don't know.  We'll get to that as well.  And your phone call is 877-212-ON-A.  Let's get ready to chuckle!  You're listening to Opie and Anthony Church. 
[00:42:30]  Well, we got an amusement park going up in Baghdad.  You must be this tall to ride, and it's the length of a head.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Beheading!  One flag!  That's the new campaign in...  Six Flags, they got rid of, you know...  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yeah.  You know that old fogey?  Yeah.  They got rid of him. 
[00:43:00]  Why?  I thought that was working well for the company.  It probably did.  Probably did for, like, you know, five minutes.  But now they got, like, this Asian guy that's, like, popping his head out at you.  It's probably one of the most offensive...  I think you'd think the Asian community would be all over this one.  It's this stereotypical Asian guy that gets really mad...  They show something that isn't very fun.  And he gets real mad, a mad face, and he just says something like this. 
[00:43:30]  One flag!  Wait, so, like...  One flag.  Six Flags is like you're having a ball.  One flag is for something just no one's enjoying.  That's not fun.  Two Flags also, not very fun.  Two Flags!  Two Flags is better than one flag.  Yeah.  And notice the kung fu punch noise before it.  Two Flags!  See, that's being stereotypical.  Of course it is.  Where's John Liu?  Where is John Liu?  John Liu!  If something...  And then they show, like, people at Six Flags... 
[00:44:00]  Uh-huh.  And he's very happy now.  Now he's very happy.  Six Flags!  Ah!  Now he's in the right place.  Six Flags!  Very much fun.  And now the ultimate.  Now he's happy.  Six Flags!  More Flags!  More Fun!  More Flags, More Fun!  More Flags, More Fun!  It's a stereotyping of an Asian gentleman.  Hey, uh...  E-Rock's participation on the Opie and Anthony show.  Anything on that?  E-Rock's participation. 
[00:44:30]  Let me see if he's got something.  This would be the fun-o-meter.  One sec!  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  But he did a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff for us last night.  All right, well...  As far as that controversy we talked about earlier today.  Two Flags!  All right, Two Flags!  Oh, he got Two Flags.  E-Rock, Two Flags?  Two Flags.  How about Jimmy's a war-ray character?  Six Flags!  Oh!  More Flags!  More Fun!  Oh!  More Flags, More Fun with Jimmy.  Two Flags.  I heard the Than and Sam show described similarly. 
[00:45:00]  One Flags!  Oh, oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh.  He put an L in there.  Two Flags!  Oh, my goodness.  That is pretty brilliant, Jimmy.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That is brilliant.  Fun-o-meter?  I thought that was out-and-un-bombed.  No, no.  Anthony Fun-o-meter?  Yes.  Earlier, we had Travis and Lisa discussing their love for hockey and their love for their little 
[00:45:30]  dog, Dexter, and their little turtle named Jack Bauer?  One Flag!  For Travis?  One Flag!  For Travis?  Yeah.  How many for Lisa?  Six Flags!  Yeah.  Ah!  Of course.  That's right.  Basically saying more entertainment with Lisa.  Of course.  Not so much with Travis.  Yeah.  One Flag!  Yeah, one flag.  Sorry, Travis.  What can I tell you?  All I want to hear, by the way, is this guy now.  One Flag! 
[00:46:00]  He rules.  One Flag!  You know, this is the old show on earth that we're every side I end up wrong.  Yeah, yeah.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Rock and roll.  Have we figured out the instant feedback thing yet?  Uh-oh.  Because the instant feedback I read is not the same one that is linked on onaradio.com, is  it?  No. 
[00:46:30]  Something we wanted to fix a long time ago?  I'll get on that.  It's a quandary.  It's a quandary?  Why?  What's the problem?  I don't understand why we have two.  Why can't we just have one and link that?  Well, the instant feedback I read is definitely not the one that you can get to through onaradio.com.  These are like the inside people, the one I read.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, way inside.  I don't even know how you would do instant feedback at this point.  All right.  We'll look at it.  Gar from Philly writes, Boston has a sports curse?  Philly.  I did not know this until today. 
[00:47:00]  Philly?  Guess how many days without a major championship in Philly?  Any team?  Just guess.  Let me think.  Let's go to the teams.  The 76ers, the Eagles, and the Phillies.  I think the Eagles are the ones.  Flyers?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know about the Flyers.  And I want to make sure this is real.  We're going to have to, like, double-check Gar's facts here.  He says that Philly hasn't won a championship in 9,000.  Is this true?  Someone has to look this up. 
[00:47:30]  9,240 days.  That is, that's got to be three years.  It's got to be two, three years.  Huh?  That's true?  How many years is that?  I don't know if the exact day is true, but I know the Sixers were the last team to win  a championship.  What year?  Approximately.  I don't know.  Okay.  I know the Phillies won, what, in 81, I think?  Didn't they win?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know.  I think.  I don't remember.  They lost in 81.  I wasn't paying attention to Philly at that point.  What?  What is it like to walk into another room with food and add nothing?  Yeah, exactly.  Go away.  What the hell is that?  He's holding this stupid little bagel sandwich with his dainty fingers, and he just walked  in and went, that's true.  Yeah.  All right.  What else do you want?  Nothing.  That's true.  This is the most comfortable show on radio.  Yeah, I just, you know, do the show while you're eating, come in, you know.  Blurt something out that helps no one. 
[00:48:30]  I'm going to say that that fact is true.  All right.  Well, we'll get to the bottom of it.  Fact is true.  That could be, as a matter of fact, the least helpful thing that one's ever seen.  I know.  Ever.  Anywhere.  And delivered so rudely with a mouthful of food.  Yeah.  That's true.  I think so.  Phillies, 81, I think.  I'm not true.  But he says that's true, knowing that we have no idea what we're talking about, and then  starts asking us questions.  That's true.  That's true.  Didn't they win in 81?  I'm going to say the Sixers won the championship in 83, which would be the 82-83 season. 
[00:49:00]  That's what I'm going to guess.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  I'm going to say the Phillies were 80, well, I'm going to go with Travis, 81.  Flyers have to go back to what?  The 70s?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  And the Eagles?  Didn't they ever win?  And the Eagles?  How did they win?  I don't know.  He just takes another bite because he has no clue.  Just fill that mouth up with food.  That's a brilliant idea, though.  Yeah.  I'm going to have breakfast in front of me, so when I'm not in on a conversation.  When someone asks you a question, you don't know the answer, you're just a spoonful in 
[00:49:30]  your mouth.  Sounds good.  All right.  The Phillies have lost more games than any other team.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, okay.  There's an interesting tidbit.  They've lost over 10,000 games.  Thanks.  All right.  Stunt Google.  Help me out here and get all those facts together.  And then we were talking about the fantasy football.  It's DirecTV.  They advertise a package where you can watch eight games at once and get fantasy football  stats at the same time.  That's Carl S. from Rhode Island.  That's a great idea for all the people doing the fantasy football. 
[00:50:00]  And Jimmy, I heard you were working out this weekend, huh?  The jiggle free.  Oh, dude.  No, I was actually really bad.  I was supposed to go to the gym yesterday and I just got so distracted because my gym  closes early on Sundays and I felt like a piece of filth.  Um, so I just decided, I had, I found a DVD, jiggle free abs, jiggle free abs.  And I did my jiggle free abs and I didn't have like the little equipment that they have.  Yeah.  So I had to use my ottoman.  Oh God. 
[00:50:30]  But I was sweating like a pig.  Jiggle free abs work.  But it seems to me like, like things like abs of steel or crunches or six pack or something  like that.  You're just starting out like, I just don't want them to jiggle.  Jiggle free abs.  Good enough for me.  That's what it says in the box.  Do you have a torso like a breast?  You don't want to raise the bar too high.  No, just stop them from jiggling and then I'll worry about it later.  I think I could be a fan of that too.  Well, I go for the eight pack or whatever the hell they're up to. 
[00:51:00]  Is it a 12 pack?  What are they up to these days?  Yeah, now it's like at least eight.  When we were growing up, it was maybe a six pack.  It was more like a four pack.  Then it went to a six pack.  Now it's up to an eight pack, I believe.  You got to have abs next to your nuts at this point in your life.  She was very good though.  She was like, we were doing all the little crunches and she's making, but here's why  I hated her guts because she kept going into things like we know what that is.  It's like you're doing a thing where you're kind of doing like a sit up where you're laying  on your back and you're kind of doing like you have your bat wings, your ears, your 
[00:51:30]  hands are behind your head and you're kind of coming up to the right, up to the right,  up to the left.  Oh yeah.  Describing all these moves.  She's like, okay, get up and lock in position.  And I'm like, I don't know how to do this.  Explain it first.  Can't you pause?  I didn't want to.  I wanted to keep up the tempo.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You didn't want to pause.  My socks on my floor.  Pause while you go to the fridge.  Exactly.  Have a hoagie.  Stupid.  Jiggle free fat pig. 
[00:52:00]  Stink him.  Jiggle free.  I'd love to watch that.  It'd be great if my abs were really hard and my breasts were just meaty and hanging.  You need jiggle free breasts.  Yeah.  Two socks with baseballs in them.  Hey, Cleveland, you know, of course, good morning to Cleveland.  Cleveland hasn't had a championship in any sport since the year before the first Super  Bowl.  Wow.  Damn.  Look up the Cleveland stats too there, Stunt Google.  That sucks.  They actually did win the award for most awful downtown area. 
[00:52:30]  Congratulations, Cleveland.  Almighty.  That is like, it looks post-apocalyptic.  It's no one walking around in it.  We like going up to Cleveland.  We just don't like staying downtown.  And last time we were there, everyone's like, you know, you got to stay, you know, a little  out.  Yeah.  Out in the burbs and stuff.  It's beautiful out there.  I thought the city was where you go.  Well, not the last time we were there.  Come on.  The homeless zombies.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  They come out at night.  You can't even go to Starbucks without getting attacked by a homeless zombie.  Hey, Tom, Brooklyn, what do you got?  What's up, boys?  I'm an officer over at the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel.  Oh.  We have a personal record over here.  115 through one of the tunnels.  115?  Yeah.  I kind of came close.  Why are you telling Anthony this, Tom?  We all try to break the record, but 115 is the top record.  Anthony admitted to, well, for the radio show, he admitted that he may have done 100 in a 
[00:53:30]  Ferrari in the Midtown Tunnel this morning.  Yeah.  We work on the same channel, so we hear the Midtown Tunnel radio conversations.  Yeah.  We didn't hear no yellow Lamborghinis getting pulled over for doing 100.  Nah.  It was a red Ferrari.  I'm imagining if you're going 100 miles an hour in the tunnel, by the time you get to  the end of it, though, you're pulled over.  So that proves that you were just saying it for the radio.  Yeah.  Just tell me no Tom from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to let him go. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  I like that.  Right on.  I remember that one.  Now, anyone that gets pulled over is going to say that.  Yeah.  Hey, I know Tom.  Tom lets a lot of guys off.  Yeah.  It really looks amazing, though, and sounds so cool.  The lights go by fast.  Have you ever watched Battlestar Galactica when they launched the little fighter?  That's what it looked like to me.  I just get scared.  I'm a wimp.  I get scared.  I made it up to 100 once.  Yeah.  That's it.  When we had those cars back at NEW, I forgot what we were driving. 
[00:54:30]  Lexuses.  Yeah.  They gave us a Lexus each for a month.  Well, it was supposed to be a month.  Anthony, they finally had to repossess it.  Yeah, they did.  I got yesterday.  I was driving around, and he pulls up next to me and goes, are you Anthony?  It's like, yeah.  Kind of identifiable, I guess, if you're driving around in that car.  Yeah.  With a, you know, of course, with a child, a mere child sitting in the passenger seat.  Yeah.  I can't imagine why a girl would want to date a guy who lives in a mansion and drives a Ferrari 
[00:55:00]  and is a complete goofball for a living with a hot tub who drinks and has barbecues.  Why would any chick want to do that?  You're better off just dating some guy who lives in a basement somewhere and is a bitter dickhead.  Why did I say that knowing I'd get dumped?  He's a bitter creep.  No responsibilities.  Three-day barbecues.  At least I'm not a bitter creep.  Just a creep.  Ferraris that go 100 miles an hour.  You're right.  Honestly, like, if I was a chick, I would date Anthony in a second. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  But it's like, you know, all he wants to do is hang out and party.  Just have fun.  He's like a big child.  Is it true on Friday that Ronnie gave you a little something something?  Oh, my God.  I heard things.  I heard the Ferrari was out front.  Yes.  Ronnie comes downstairs and the first thing he says is,  So, you just decided, throw caution to the wind.  Just blow it all.  Right?  Just spend it or just get rid of it. 
[00:56:00]  And he points to the passenger seat.  He's like, so who's in the teen seat?  Who's in the teen seat?  Didn't he say something like, did the Ferrari come with a sippy cup?  Yeah.  And then he said, does it have a sippy cup?  And you got to tell her not to drop candy in the seats.  It gets sticky and it's hard to clean.  And then he got on his show and said, I just saw Anthony take off in a rocket ship with  a sippy cup.  He is such a smart ass. 
[00:56:30]  And it's enjoying his life.  You got to have a little bit of fun.  That's all.  You got to pay the bills, but, you know, have a little fun.  Anybody see the VMAs?  No.  I checked it out for a little while.  40 seconds of it.  Russell Brand did all right.  We've had him on the couch.  We'll never have him in here again because now he's famous.  I mean, really famous.  He's always been famous in the United Kingdom.  But now, you know, hosting the VMAs, we'll never see him on that couch again.  He came in for forgetting Sarah Marshall and he was great.  We hit it off, but he did all right. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, he was interested in talking about heroin and stuff.  I watched literally 35 seconds.  He looked uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure I would be too doing that gig as a comic.  That's not an easy gig.  Well, he got himself in a situation yesterday.  And then you had one of these do-gooders.  Well, let's start with the Britney Spears thing and then I'll explain what I was about to explain.  They were advertising that Britney, you know, was going to open the VMAs and everyone's thinking,  oh my God, she's going to, like, reenact that dance thing.  Yeah.  But do it right.  And I guess they had some kind of, some video of her practicing. 
[00:57:30]  So everyone was convinced that she was going to, you know, open up the VMAs dancing.  And they made this such a big deal and this is what Britney Spears did.  This is it.  Right here.  This is the big opener.  This is how she opened up the VMAs.  Thank you so much.  Thank you for all the love.  I'm here tonight to celebrate a very important birthday, the 25th anniversary of the VMAs.  This is the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards and it starts right now.  That's it.  There you go. 
[00:58:00]  That's what they advertised for about a month.  Now get off the stage, fatty.  All she had to do was read and she was reading really fast because I guess she was nervous,  really nervous or something, freaked out that she was back there.  So that was it.  And the other thing, this is what I was sort of explaining.  Russell Brand, who did a great job, he decided to go after the Jonas Brothers the entire show.  No one bigger than the Jonas Brothers these days.  Apparently if you're, you know, a young chick.  Yeah.  And they're all about saving themselves for marriage and they got those rings. 
[00:58:30]  What do they call those?  Promise rings.  What?  Promise rings.  Promise rings?  Is that the one that your parents give you and you promise not to have sex until you're married?  Promise rings.  That's nice.  The girls are eating these guys up and one of the guys, what a little light in the luffers.  Really?  You think he wears his promise rings somewhere else?  This guy has no problem breaking the promise. 
[00:59:00]  Trust me.  What a little.  I'm just saying, man.  I think this guy is going to discover himself in a few more years.  Wait, wait, gay or?  Could you get the, um, last night during the VMAs, maybe Sam or somebody in the office is listening.  They, uh, the two Jonas Brothers were sitting on a fake New York City, like, uh, stoop.  And the third one comes in and is like, hi guys. 
[00:59:30]  And sits down.  And then they're about to perform their tune.  And I heard this kid talk for the first time.  I'm like, wow.  Which one's the fruit?  I don't know.  I don't, I can't.  I don't even know their names.  Left, middle, right.  Yeah, they're like little pseudo-emo looking jackasses.  The one on the end, the one on the end, looks like a Horowitz from Bad Boys.  Yeah.  Horowitz. 
[01:00:00]  Blowing up a radio next to someone's face.  What an ugly tool.  How old are these guys?  I don't know.  Maybe get the friggin' kids.  Maybe get the clip if we can.  The setup just before they start playing.  Just one of their awful songs.  Just horrendous.  I don't know why they're, they're so huge.  But Russell, hold on.  Steve from Bayshore says one of them is sort of a shaved Travis.  Oh, really?  Steve from Bayshore.  They all kind of look like Travis, I guess.  I guess the one with the orange thing tied around his neck is the possible. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  That's to wipe his mouth off when he's done.  He's got to keep a rag handy.  It's a seed bib.  Did you guys read about Dennis Leary's joke speaking of?  You read it?  Can you get that?  I don't want to mess up his joke.  And I know we got to kind of keep it clean.  But we'll get it out there.  Dennis Leary had a really good set at some kind of benefit.  It was at the Fashion Rocks.  Fashion Rocks.  And his line about Ricky Martin is just amazing. 
[01:01:00]  It's amazing.  And the post, I think, or the Daily News, one of those dumb papers,  they printed the joke in the paper yesterday.  Daily News had it all yesterday.  Was it Daily News?  Yeah.  Yeah, find it.  Because I don't want to try to, you know, I want to read word for word.  But anyway, so Russell Brand decided to go after these Jonas Brothers.  His whole act was just making fun of the Jonas Brothers.  The whole situation, in fact, makes the idea of pledging to God that you'll remain a virgin to your marriage seem like quite a good idea. 
[01:01:30]  So well done, the Jonas Brothers.  God bless those boys.  In case you are unaware, each of the Jonas Brothers does wear a tiny ring as a mark of their commitment to God.  I'd take it a little bit more seriously if they wore it on their genitals.  And also, it is a little bit ungrateful because they can literally have sex with any woman that they want,  but it's not going to do it.  That is like Superman just deciding not to fly and to go everywhere on a bus. 
[01:02:00]  Everywhere on a bus.  Right.  This is leading to something that's going to, you know, definitely piss off Jimmy.  It's leading to something.  So yesterday in the Daily News, Dennis Leary's line, this is what he said.  Ricky Martin will not be here tonight, Leary said.  He just had twins today.  Surrogate mom.  Yeah, they had to do it that way because babies don't come out of other men's.  Oh, wow.  Whoa.  Plank. 
[01:02:30]  That's a hell of a line by Mr. Leary.  How great is that?  All right.  And then Russell Brand went on with the Jonas Brothers abuse.  But here, at their own request to bring on the Jonas Brothers is Taylor Swift.  It'll be a little while before she brings any of them off.  Taylor Swift, there she is.  Bring them on.  Bring them off.  Just making fun of them, right?  And then finally this one.  Amazing performance we've just seen from Paramore. 
[01:03:00]  That was pretty exciting, wasn't it?  It wasn't as it seemed.  They were here all along.  And things fell away to reveal it weren't what it bloody seemed.  And I'm beginning to wonder, you know, are the Jonas Brothers quite what they seem?  Because if they were, how come I've got this little ring now?  I mean, initially he was a little bit reluctant.  But eventually he sort of saw that it was for the best.  And let me tell you, it was an enjoyable and pleasant experience.  And I wish the rest of the Jonas Brothers the best of luck.  Because over the course of the evening, I want a collection of these bloody things.  So, obviously... 
[01:03:30]  He was going very quickly.  Yeah, he was very...  I think he was very nervous.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  But the point is, he's going after the Jonas Brothers the entire awards show.  Yeah.  Guess what happened?  Just like that other awards show, someone had a...  But Sean Penn stepped up for...  Who was the guy?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It was...  He's a fine actor.  The finest actor.  Who the hell is...  Oh, my God.  It's the dude losing his hair.  But his...  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, my...  What?  Somebody help us.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  It's Jude Law.  Jude Law.  Ah.  Jude Law.  What's his name?  Took a shot at Jude Law.  Chris Rock.  Chris Rock.  It was a really funny line that none of us remember.  Who is Jude Law?  He was, like, asking who the hell he was.  Yeah, he was, like, in three movies.  And he was just making jokes.  And then Sean Penn had to go up there and goes,  Well, I'll tell you, you know, Mr. Rock,  Jude Law is one of our finest actors working today.  Just a self-important douche.  Sean Penn is a bore.  Oof. 
[01:04:30]  Well, we had a bore.  What happened to him?  Well, we had one of those moments last night.  So you got Russell Brand, you know,  trying to, like, make fun of the Jonas Brothers.  And that pig, that one American Idol, that pig.  Which one?  Jordan Sparks.  Big as an effing house.  And they're trying to make her look like she's a sexy mama.  Yes.  Had to stick up for the Jonas Brothers last night.  She didn't get it.  All right, I just have one thing to say about promise rings.  It's not bad to wear a promise ring,  because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut. 
[01:05:00]  All right, so anyway.  Um.  See, it's easy to wear a promise ring if you're as big as a doorway,  because no one's going to F you.  Ugh.  And if they, by the way, if they went out of their way  to let everybody know they wear promise rings,  then they're nerds.  Yeah.  They should be made fun of.  A promise ring.  Why are the girls falling for these guys that,  and they wear promise rings? 
[01:05:30]  That's the cool thing?  Are we that out of touch now?  We must be.  Because they're just eating up the Jonas Brothers.  Are they?  There's no one bigger than the Jonas Brothers right now.  You're right.  In the pop world.  And then Russell Bray.  Congratulations.  I've got to say sorry, because I said them things about promise rings that were bad to me.  I didn't mean to take it lightly or whatever.  I love the Jonas Brothers.  I think it's really good.  Who told him he had to go out there and apologize?  Was he kidding? 
[01:06:00]  Was there a joke after that?  Better be.  We'll find out in a second here.  I love the Jonas Brothers.  I think it's really good.  And I don't want to piss off teenage fans, all right?  In fact, quite the opposite.  In fact, by opposite, I don't mean I want to on teenage fans.  Let me be clear.  Yeah, I know there's been trouble with that in the past in this country, and I don't want  to get dragged into none of that rhubarb.  It's not my style at all.  So, promise rings.  I'm well up for it.  Well done, everyone. 
[01:06:30]  It's just, you know, a bit of sex occasionally.  Never hurt anybody.  It's too, like, fast.  I don't know what's going on there, that English delivery.  It was kind of uncomfortable to watch.  He was very hyper.  Yeah, not quite.  He came out basically telling everyone that they need to vote for Obama.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we get that.  Like, legitimately?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He went real political right off the bat.  This country needs Obama.  How does he know what he needs? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  How does he know what we need?  This country needs Obama, and everyone needs to vote for Obama.  People tell us, like, what we need here from other countries.  Exactly.  What do you need?  Get rid of your stupid royal family.  Save some money.  He made fun of the royal family, but, yeah.  Oh, yeah, but it's all good natured, isn't it?  Maybe we can get that clip, too.  All right, we've got to take a quick break, and we'll continue.  Yeah, Obama kind of had a mess up on live TV, and he didn't even realize he was messing up.  Someone had to correct him. 
[01:07:30]  Oops.  And then get your opinion on Oprah not having Sarah Palin on her show, because, you know,  she's supporting the Obama man.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  To answer the Philly question, 100 seasons, 100 nuts.  They haven't won anything since 83.  Damn.  Yeah.  76ers and 83.  I have some bad news. 
[01:08:00]  What is that about, Jimmy?  The music stops.  My Boston show is sold out, so thank you, Boston.  Wow.  Yeah, it was really good.  Nice.  That's awesome.  Yes, and thank you to BCM, but that is sold out for November 15th.  I guess we're doing all right up there, huh?  Unbelievable.  I want to go.  So?  Wilbur Theater?  Yeah.  I'm going to scalp tickets.  I'm going to make a fortune.  Yeah.  Tickets.  I'm going to be scalping the ticks.  I already have a link to scalp tickets for them on my website.  Yes. 
[01:08:30]  Yes, I get a percentage.  So we got some Obama audio.  What show is this on?  Meet the Douche?  Meet the...  Oh.  No, it wasn't Meet the Press.  It was the ABC show with George Stephanopoulos, the Sunday morning thing they do.  Oh, the Lego-haired queer.  Yeah.  It's a good show.  Listen to this.  You and I both know that the minute that Governor Palin was forced to talk about her daughter, 
[01:09:00]  I immediately said, that's off limits.  And John McCain said the same thing about questioning your faith.  And what was the first thing the McCain campaign went out and did?  They said, look, these liberal blogs that support Obama are out there attacking Governor Palin.  Let's not play games.  What I was suggesting, you're absolutely right that John McCain has not talked about my Muslim faith. 
[01:09:30]  And you're absolutely right that that is not my Christian faith.  Well, what I'm saying is he hasn't suggested that I'm a Muslim.  And I think that his campaign upper echelons have not either.  Uh-oh.  What's that about?  Well, according to the papers, just a slight verbal misstep.  Oops.  It happens.  My Muslim faith.  Oh.  Bush says nuclear, and he's a retard. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Which is correct.  Yeah.  He says he gets the wrong faith, and it's a light verbal misstep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  How do you mess that one up?  Because you really don't know what you're doing.  Because you're a Muslim.  That's why.  He's a Muslim.  Wow.  That's a little bit of a trip up.  And then he really started getting flustered.  Yeah.  He couldn't get a word out.  Oh, my God.  I just said I'm a Muslim.  Oh, jeez.  I blew the election. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Did I just say that?  Holy crap.  I really screwed up.  I had this thing.  I had it in the bag.  I don't think this country really likes the Muslim faith.  Good one.  That's a good slip up right there.  He should have just pulled out one of those turban thingies,  throwing it on his head at that point.  I mean, I'm at the conventions over.  What do you guys think of Sarah Palin?  Is it still like rah, rah, Sarah, or what?  Yeah, I think she's all right.  I mean, do you want someone in there with more experience? 
[01:11:00]  Sure.  And then somebody in one of the newspapers, letters to the editor,  said having her in there one, as they say,  a heartbeat away from the presidency.  I hate that cliche.  But they said that's better than having Pelosi  two heartbeats away from the presidency.  So you know something?  That person, whoever it was, made a good point.  I don't mind her.  I think, yeah, more experience. 
[01:11:30]  But no one gets thrown into the presidency.  Let's say they're elected.  McCain, tragic, something happens.  He can't be the president anymore.  Can I stop you for one second?  Because I was thinking of this.  Going into the presidency,  has anyone looked more like crap than John McCain  in the history of the presidency?  I'm sure someone like Rutherford B. Hayes looked awful.  Taft.  Well, anyone?  Those guys you can't count.  Let's say from the 1900 on. 
[01:12:00]  John McCain looks like crap going into this job.  Lincoln's second term.  Sorry, Matt.  But something to think about, maybe.  Maybe someone else.  Because they always mention Reagan  that was old when he became president.  But he always looked really good for his age.  God damn it.  I think I forgot.  Son of a bitch.  What were you saying?  Oh, if he died.  Right.  If he died and she takes over, 
[01:12:30]  do you think it's going to be like  they're just going to go,  well, they're president now.  Go ahead.  Do president stuff.  Or do you think there's people  that know everything to do,  advisors around the new president,  regardless of who that is  when the vice president takes over,  that says,  here's how it works.  We're going to have your meetings  with your secretary of state  and the cabinet and everybody else.  And you have your advisors.  And they advise you.  It's not like you're just in there, 
[01:13:00]  you know,  what do I do?  They'll advise her to get rid of the minivan.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Get rid of the pantsuit.  No more hockey games for you.  Oh, she's going to have to stop that.  She's going to be in Washington.  No more lipstick.  You've got to look a little tougher.  No, I think she should look ladylike.  Yeah.  Have a real hottie going around the globe.  It's like,  oh, they're sending her to Germany.  And she could go there a little gussied up.  Maybe participate in some of their animal  or scat videos 
[01:13:30]  that they love so much  in that Concord Nation.  I don't want her as the president.  I'm sorry.  She's not ready to be president.  Yeah.  No.  No.  If McCain dies,  she takes over?  No.  I mean,  at least Biden has 30 years.  But Obama doesn't have  the experience.  But the bottom line is  she's a chick from Alaska.  Mm-hmm.  I don't want her.  Yeah.  No.  I'd rather have Hillary than her.  If I would have a woman,  I would have Hillary.  Wow.  Yeah, Hillary's much more qualified 
[01:14:00]  to do a foreign policy than she is.  You don't have to like Hillary  to understand that statement,  I think.  I agree with Jimmy.  Hillary way over the Sarah Payland.  Way over.  You know what it is, though?  It's like foreign policy.  All right.  She knows nothing about it.  But then you pick a secretary of state  that knows a lot about foreign policy,  and then your problem's solved.  You can't really know about everything.  She's a right to lifer.  Do you really want more conservatives  in the Supreme Court?  No, but I feel like her stance on guns. 
[01:14:30]  They're not going to take guns.  They're trying their darndest.  And goddamn Obama,  Obama is one of the worst people  that are against the Second Amendment.  He hates people owning guns in this country.  He's from Chicago.  It's like the guns don't do good there.  Well, you're not allowed to have them.  Realize you can't have them? 
[01:15:00]  You'll be able to own your guns.  Legal people can't have them there.  You'll have your guns.  Only the crooks can have them.  That's what everyone says.  You'll have your guns  until they enact these things.  Assault weapons.  We have to ban assault weapons.  What does that mean?  Oh, it's got a flash suppressor  on the end of the friggin' barrel.  Oh, because it looks like something.  An assault weapon, by definition,  is nothing different than a hunting rifle  with some cool-looking stuff on it. 
[01:15:30]  That's all.  But they name it something  to make it sound like people  going out with machine guns.  You'll have your guns, my friend.  No, they won't allow me to have them.  Don't you worry.  Taking my guns from my cold, dead hands.  You'll have your guns and your fast cars.  Don't you worry.  All of this nonsense with the FCC,  like all this gigantic fines.  Come on, man.  That'll never go away, though, now.  No, but all that stuff gets pushed through.  They just... 
[01:16:00]  Look, I'm not as conservative as I used to be  just because I see the effect it had on radio,  and it just makes me sick.  Hey, can I back you up?  You were talking about Chicago, Jimmy?  Yes.  Or Chicago.  Chicago, the Windy City.  And by the way,  they're not taking away people's abortions.  You can't take away abortions.  She's a right to lifer.  Yeah, but, well,  you can't take it away.  So is Bush.  Okay.  You're not taking away people's abortions.  I just want to throw this fact out there. 
[01:16:30]  123 people have been killed in Chicago  this summer, this past summer,  because now summer's over.  Twice the U.S. soldier death toll  in Iraq during the same period.  There you go.  That's what's going on in Chicago.  And you're not allowed to own a handgun in Chicago.  You're not allowed to buy one.  You can't.  As a citizen,  there is no Second Amendment in Chicago.  They just overturned it in D.C.  but made ridiculous rules  where you have to have it locked up  in a box separate from the ammo 
[01:17:00]  in your house,  disassembled,  whatever it is.  And they're challenging that, too,  because you have the right to protect yourself.  And you have the right to bear arms.  In your home,  you should be able to do  whatever the hell you want, right, Ant?  Of course.  None of this big brother crap.  Freedom.  Freedom, my tookus.  Well, how do they get the illegal guns  off the streets, then, Mr. NRA?  By loading up the legal gun owners,  and then they slowly eliminate the bad people.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Sure.  You just shoot them and leave them dead.  And then they're dead.  The cops take the illegal gun.  There's one illegal gun off the street.  It's a scale no one's going to miss anyway.  Friggin' waste of life.  You friggin' air wasters.  That's what I call it.  We got a 13-year-old  who wants to give you the gun laws in Jersey.  We got a little old J.C.  A little J.C.  J.C.  Got that funny kid voice.  Yeah.  Hi.  What's up, J.C.?  Hey, guys. 
[01:18:00]  Hi.  I'm Anthony.  In New Jersey,  it's considered an assault rifle.  They can take that away  and take your right-to-own gun.  Yeah, isn't that great?  It's an assault weapon.  I can't put a folding stock on my gun.  My .22 almost qualified.  It's a 14-round magazine.  A .22 is an assault rifle.  Did this kid just say my .22?  Yeah, I'm proud of a little J.C. 
[01:18:30]  God bless J.C.  That's right.  Second Amendment.  Woo!  Love your guns, J.C.  Love your guns.  Hey, J.C.,  while we have you on the phone,  what do you think of Promise Rings  and the Jonas Brothers?  Bunch of assholes  and they're way severe  to quote Anthony.  Looks like you got a little fan there, man.  Ah, J.C. rules.  All right, J.C.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  There goes J.C.  telling you what's going on in Jersey.  He's a little potty mouth.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana. 
[01:19:00]  Bruce?  Yeah, Opie, you and Jimmy,  you guys keep saying  that they're not going to take our guns.  Biden authored the assault weapons ban.  Obama was a key proponent  in keeping guns illegal in Chicago.  They want to take our guns.  They want us to be like the U.N.  with, you know,  all these countries  that are not allowed  to have small arms  for their individual citizens.  They absolutely are trying.  You could look up,  there's 10 instances  where Obama  is absolutely trying 
[01:19:30]  to undermine the Second Amendment  and take people's guns away,  limiting gun stores  down to barely anything.  He doesn't want people  to own handguns in their house.  He does not want,  he wants handgun ownership  eliminated from this country.  But it won't get done like that.  I know he's definitely going to,  hold on, bro,  he's definitely going to  infringe on as far as  what you can get,  of course,  but he's not going to be able  to eliminate it.  You're always going to be able  to get...  Well, I don't want a musket.  Oh, you're allowed 
[01:20:00]  one musket per household.  I want that.  But you have that.  You do.  I know I have that.  It's not going to make you  give it back.  Lots of that.  Oh, really?  That's never happened?  No, you'll be grandfathered in.  Maybe it has happened,  I don't know.  I don't like the fact  even grandfathered in.  I'm looking toward  the future of this country.  In Illinois,  you're not allowed  to have a gun store  within so many feet  of a school,  a liquor store,  any residential areas.  They're making it work.  That's everything. 
[01:20:30]  You can own guns.  You can't have gun stores  in the city limits.  Yeah, they're restricting  other things  like ammunition  and things.  They restrict that,  which undermines  your Second Amendment.  I'm glad the Supreme Court  voted for D.C. gun ownership.  Now they've just got to fix it  and make that better.  And then they've got to  also fix Chicago.  And New York City  is a pain in the ass.  That is definitely  an infringement  on your Second Amendment  right in New York City 
[01:21:00]  because it's impossible  to get a gun license  in here.  There's no reason.  You shouldn't have to  come up with a reason  besides self-protection.  There's these reasons  you need.  Oh, I carry large amounts  of money  or there's this or that.  That's not in the Constitution.  It says that they shouldn't  infringe in any way.  You're done.  That's it.  It's plain English.  But you have to admit  and it's been pointed out  a million times.  I'm for the Second Amendment.  But it's a different game  now than it was then.  And the stuff that they 
[01:21:30]  that they wanted back then  did not have the ability  that it does now.  It's just a different thing.  It's technology.  It's great.  But the reason it's  a different game now  is because the only people  that the laws affect  are people that obey the law.  Yeah.  People that disobey the law  are always going to  disobey the law.  I understand that.  No guns in a school zone.  Do you think the criminal  is going to say  well damn  I'm not going to go  shoot the school off.  No but you know what  the NRA has fought things. 
[01:22:00]  They've fought things  like certain types of  like background checks.  They fight every single thing  people do.  They literally want you  to be able to go out  and buy anything you want.  There's no balance  with them either.  The only reason they do that  is because the other side  is so insanely crazy also  that they have to  that's the only way  to balance it out.  And there's you know  got to be some kind  of middle ground.  I'm all for FBI checks.  Of course.  I'm not for waiting periods.  I don't like that.  I see a gun.  I want to buy one.  I want to take it in. 
[01:22:30]  What's wrong with the  I mean you're responsible dude  but what if a guy  has a fight with his wife  and again whatever  wants to go out  and buy a gun.  What's wrong with  a waiting period  for something that can be  For a lippy broad?  I'm not saying  she didn't ask for it.  But that same guy  is going to go home  and just beat his wife to death  or buy one.  You wait two days.  If you want to break the law  you're going to break the law.  Yeah I know like  there are guys  that buy guns legally  and then just go  and rampage them.  Right yeah. 
[01:23:00]  It happens.  I'm not saying  that never happens.  Of course.  Again the NRA  fights anything.  I don't care why  they do it.  Maybe they want balance.  If they had their way  there would be  no background checks.  I don't believe  they would allow  any background checks  if they had their way.  So they're completely  out of whack.  The White Amendment  says this right  cannot be infringed upon.  I know.  And the left  constantly  finds every little way  to take that right away  any time they can.  Okay but once again 
[01:23:30]  the Constitution  terrific  but there is something  in the Constitution  where you kind of have to  try to get into  the mindset  of the people  who were there  when it was happening  which is kind of how  I think it was  Brown Board of Education  were separate but equal  was they were saying  that the mindset  was not to make it  bad for one  and good for the other.  So the mindset  I don't think  was to allow  any lunatic  that wants to buy a gun  to buy a gun  without being checked.  I don't think  that was what  their mindset was.  I agree with that  and I believe  there should be  background checks  and felons 
[01:24:00]  shouldn't be allowed  to all that.  Of course.  I'm all for that.  Yeah.  Well did they say felons?  Did they say felons  in the Second Amendment?  No.  No it doesn't say felons  but also  it just says  you know  that you have the right  to keep and bear arms  and a well formed militia  and this right  cannot be infringed upon.  I look what militias  do nowadays  most of them  are Aryans  they're just asses  I mean they're just  a lot of them  are white supremacists  the militia  they're just 
[01:24:30]  they're in the woods  holing up  doing weird stuff  what about the  weekend guys  they're just out there  having fun with their  weekend warriors  in the woods  our government  is not  I'm sorry  no no I'm saying  our government  this is not the same time  we're not going to be  forcefully overtaken  by another government  it's not going to happen  but you  you have to have  the people have to have  a certain amount of power  I agree  in the event  that there is  a situation  you look at Katrina  and I'm from Louisiana 
[01:25:00]  so I know  the law enforcement  came and took  our guns away  from us  legal citizens  that were not  breaking the law  we were trying  to evacuate  we were trying  to get to safe  haven  to higher ground  to better places  and they would  take our guns  they would pull us over  at gunpoint  not me particularly  but people I know  pulled over at gunpoint  do you have any weapons  yeah I've got my pistol  and take these guns away  lock them up  destroy them 
[01:25:30]  never give them back  there's a book called  the Great New Orleans  Gun Ban  that tells all about it  there was news stories  done about it  law abiding citizens  while people downtown  were looting  raping  pillaging  murdering  and there was nothing  being done about that  but law abiding citizens  that were evacuating  were having their guns  taken away from them  gun control like that  just doesn't  it doesn't work  when you take  the people's right  to own guns away  it doesn't  it doesn't fight crime  look at the cities  where they've done this  it doesn't work 
[01:26:00]  no one is saying  I want people's rights  to own guns taken away  and I'm not saying  what happened in New Orleans  where they're taking  legal guns from  honest citizens away  is right at all  but they did a lot of things  that were horrendous  with Katrina  I mean that whole thing  it's nice to know  that it was handled horribly  from top to bottom  completely  they botched  every aspect of Katrina  it was terrible  but I'm not for  eliminating all guns  I just  the NRA makes me sick  because they are  as bad as any  left wing fringe group  they're as bad  as any of these 
[01:26:30]  douchey protesters  you know the world  I'm a member sir  but you know  that they go too far  they want no balance  at all  you never hear the NRA  it's because the other side  is just as bad  it doesn't matter why  and any reason  that someone has no balance  there's no excusable reason  as to why they have no balance  everyone has a reason  as to why they have no balance  it's silly  alright  hey  I love you guys  thanks for letting me on  hey Anthony  fast guards  big guns  hot women  in your life buddy  thank you sir  there you go  there's a fan  Kevin in Pittsburgh 
[01:27:00]  what's up  I just want to see  if Anthony thinks  just a private citizen  should be able to go in  and buy a rocket launcher  well no  absolutely not  of course  there's some type of  middle ground there  I don't think you should be able  to buy a howitzer  you shouldn't be able  to buy mortars  you know  there are certain things  that are only  for the military  but  a claymore  can take out 15 people  or a claymore  you shouldn't be able  to buy a claymore  I'm talking about 
[01:27:30]  handguns  and rifles  here  this is pretty  pretty simple stuff  what's the difference  if you can kill 20 people  with a rocket launcher  or 20 people  with a machine gun  what's the difference  because  it's kind of  dangerous  to have a rocket launcher  it's hard to be safe  with a rocket launcher  even if you're being safe  how can you justify  protecting your home  with a rocket launcher  or a claymore  it doesn't make sense bro  I mean  that's a silly argument  it's the same thing  with an assault rifle though  how many people  are going to invade your house  it's not  an assault 
[01:28:00]  what is dubbed  what is dubbed  an assault rifle  by certain people  is a lot of fun  to shoot at the range  I go down to the range  and blast off some rounds  it's a challenge  to your accuracy  to yourself  it's a lot of fun  to shoot these guns  it just is  and that's why  I have them  home protection  sure  it's nice to have  around for home protection  but 
[01:28:30]  it's nice to shoot  shooting is a  it's a sport  it's a hobby  it's something  you do  but when you look  at the second amendment  and the way people  scream about the second amendment  does it really boil down to  well it's kind of fun  to shoot at the range  but it is  but that's like  that's secondary  to the fact that  I like being  an armed citizen  I do  there's a feeling  of security  you get  that you don't  when you're not  an armed citizen  that's all I have to say 
[01:29:00]  if I trusted  if I trusted  myself  I agree with you  if I trusted myself  I would actually have  a gun  so you're responsible  you know that  I mean you know  that you can't trust yourself  so you don't get one  yeah believe me  my scalp would wind up  on the ceiling  one bad phone call  you'd be old bump head guy  it would be  bump  and then people would be  shoot in your house  that go right ahead  you just feel free  to interject  as I was getting to the point  go ahead stop  sorry to me  go for a punchline  it's all about you  you done Kevin  yeah I'm done 
[01:29:30]  alright thank you  one more before break  Mark in Florida  Mark  hey I just wanted to point out  that Jimmy's only partially right  about the NRA  being so far  to the extreme  before Heston came aboard  that's all they were  but when Heston came aboard  he tried to unite them  and make it so that  they do accept  you know  some form of checks  you know  background checks  and safety programs  and that you can't  go out and buy  a grenade launcher  I mean  Anthony you get the  magazines to prove it  if Jimmy would actually  read them  the armed guardian  talks about all this stuff 
[01:30:00]  yeah I know  they really are  for the background checks  FBI checks  I mean this is things  there's no organization  a legitimate organization  like the NRA  that wants felons  to have weapons  they just  well why not certain felons  like when you look at it  like you know what  there are certain felons  that come out of jail  that are much less dangerous  than just psychopaths  that are not felons  that's true  maybe it should be  like a degree  of what kind of felony  you were convicted for  I mean there's so many 
[01:30:30]  different types of felonies  out there  I don't think it should  be blanket  I mean you also lose  your right to vote  too  well I'm kind of  I'm kind of like  let's start simple  and how about letting  the people that  don't have felonies  on their record  and are law abiding  citizens  responsible  you can run through  an FBI check  without any problems  let them own guns  in whatever god damn city  you live in  because that's  our right  it's number two 
[01:31:00]  over speech  Jesus  I think they felt  it was important  but the way they  keep quoting  like you told me  at the second  they're like  without restriction  whatever  without infringement  whatever it is  shall not infringe  in any way  speaking of which  Stephen Connecticut  has something for you  Jimmy  Steve  hey what's up guys  hey  I understand  and they're right  about the NRA  as well  there's a group  called the Gun Owners  of America  that is a little bit  more  they're a little bit 
[01:31:30]  I should say  the NRA is actually  in the gun lobby's  pocket now  a lot of  gun owners  are aware of that  but anyhow  as far as the  second amendment goes  the point is  in places where  anybody can  the more guns  there are  the safer it is  Jimmy  that's the deal  in other words  the wackos  are going to get them  but they're going to  think twice  before going into  the corner store  and pulling a gun  out and robbing the place  because there's going to  be somebody there  with a level head  that's going to  end the situation 
[01:32:00]  quickly  just that alone  is what keeps people  from doing things  I understand  that angle of it  that's why  same thing with the airlines  they ought to be able  to protect their own property  not have the government  do it  so how are they  with the airlines  you're saying  I'm kind of mixed  on pilots having guns  you mean  just the idea  of it being there  and the myth  that you're going  to fire the gun  and the plane  is going to crash  that doesn't happen  my problem with that  is that  with a gun  is like  if there's a mentally  unstable person  that works  on the plane 
[01:32:30]  who actually has  cockpit access  that scares me  to put a gun  into play there  well just then  let the pilots have it  there could be  one of the pilots  that kind of  frightens me  if you trust the guy  with the plane  wouldn't he crash  the plane  that's true  it's like  screw this  I have a gun  wait I have a plane  35,000 feet in the air  I don't want to  brought it to play  it happened  with that Egyptian  airline  remember the guy  decided to do  the old nosedive  and it's really rare  it's not rare  you guys  9-11 would have  never happened 
[01:33:00]  honestly  if we had  a policy of  don't open the door  and negotiate  9-11 wouldn't have  happened  9-11 wouldn't have  happened if we had  a policy of  do not open the door  to negotiate  9-11 would not  have happened as much  if Flight 93  would have gotten  the original text  and just understood  and locked the door  so they couldn't  come through the door  it wouldn't have  happened if the guy  in Maine  who saw Mohammed Atta  and another guy  walked through  and was immediately  suspicious  wasn't worried  about being politically  correct  and actually  stop these  that's your government  that's your government  taking care of you 
[01:33:30]  let the airlines  do it  that's what happens  when you  the airlines  are as afraid  brother  the airlines  are as afraid  of consumer boycott  and are afraid  of being politically  incorrect  as the government  is  the companies  are as  I agree  there is a trend  of that going on  in general  but government  more so than not  especially with  like charities  government's got to  give it to everybody  private charities  can be picked  how would a gun  would not have  stopped 9-11  it might have been  the idea of a gun  being there  we've had the attitude  since the 70s  what are you talking  about  it would not 
[01:34:00]  have stopped it  they cut the throats  it would not  it might have saved  one of the planes  but it would not  have stopped it  it would not have  stopped  they got their  throats cut  immediately  how about an air marshal  some people  might have died  but it would have  ended awfully quickly  the planes  never would have  been hijacked  the pilots  could have just  popped a couple  people  just the idea  of that even  happening  do they storm  the cockpit  sir why are you  screaming  get a hold of  yourself  none of us  like 9-11  stupid 
[01:34:30]  your name is  not Fred  World Trade  Center  none of us  liked it  you're not the  only one who  was bothered  by it  God almighty  he's acting  like I'm  some foreigner  trashing America  I live here  dope  you're trashing  the second  amendment  Jim  is that what  I'm doing  because I don't  agree with it  all the way  you radical  dope  I'm not  trashing it  I agree  with it  there you go  radical  speak English  you're lying  you're a liar  I agree  with this  you just said  that I'm  trashing the  second amendment  when in reality 
[01:35:00]  I said  I agree  with it  but I think  that it's  misinterpreted  now  that's what  I said  I agree  with it  Steve  I don't  agree with  your 9-11  stuff either  because this  was the first  time they  didn't land  the plane  in some  weird location  and have  the hostage  situation  this was the  first time  we all realized  holy crap  these guys  are going to  take their  own lives  and crash  these planes  into buildings  and we didn't  have anything  to go by  before 9-11  as far as that  goes  I think even  pre-9-11  hijackings in 
[01:35:30]  general  hijacking in  general  they landed  in Cuba  wherever the  hell  got some  cash and  got some  prisoners freed  and that was it  even back to  the 70s  I think  it works  well with  other private  companies  let them guard  their own  stuff  they have a  policy of  randomly having  an FAA agent  on there  possibly  which is very  few flights  it even do  versus  letting them  protect their  own property  they would do  it much better  than $8 an  hour  people they got  at the screeners 
[01:36:00]  those guys  make nothing  how many hijackings  have there been  in this country  since 9-11  in the last  7 years  there's been  none  there's been  none  and the way  it's going to  happen again  is they're going  to figure out  a way to blow  the planes up  in mid-air  that's what's  going to happen  and then we're  going to go  well you have to  every time they  get us  we go okay  we have to  correct that  had Richard  Reed pulled  off what he  wanted to  on that  American flight  to Paris  we wouldn't  have known  what happened  we probably  still wouldn't  be taking  our shoes  off  and it  would have  happened  a couple  more times  until we  figured it 
[01:36:30]  out  that's the  way it is  look at the  corrections we  have had  as far as  the Patriot Act  and all that  stuff Jim  that's why  I agree  that with  the Republicans  in particular  are horrible  on that  stuff  I mean  you know  that they have  to take away  our civil liberties  and what not  slowly  you know  one at a time  and to the point  where we don't  notice what  they've taken  away  and to the point  where they're  tapping our phones  like they are  in China  I don't mind  the Patriot Act  I don't know  enough about  the Patriot Act  to be honest  I'm not  pulling shenanigans  we gotta take a break  Steve  thank you so much 
[01:37:00]  to say that I'm  against the Second  Amendment is just  not accurate  I'm for  I don't want to  see  I know  you're packing  heat right now  right in the front  of your pants  I see it  I don't want to  see guns taken  away  I just think  the other way  goes too far  and we forgot  before 9-11  they weren't  crashing planes  into buildings  they were  landing them  somewhere  we were caught  with our old  pants down  I was watching  a special  it was last night  actually I was  watching it  and they were  talking about  how there were  people on the  plane that first  flight that  I hijacked  which I think  was Flight 11  where they thought 
[01:37:30]  it was a medical  emergency  they were going back  there might have  been people  on that first  flight  who really  never knew  they were about  to die  because in  Cochise  a lot of  them really  thought it was  a routine  medical emergency  that they had  to go back  oh look  we're zigzagging  through the  streets of  Manhattan  yeah  it's like  what  look out  the window  well maybe  it'll last  few seconds  just horrifying  we're going to  take a break  and when we get  back we're going  to talk about  the Third  Amendment  not many people  know what  the Third  Amendment is  the Third  Amendment  I hate  that one  is  is 
[01:38:00]  is that  the one  where they  first is  they let  the  first is  speech  second is  guns  third is  is  Third  Amendment  Third Amendment  illegal search  and seizure  quartering  soldiers  what  quartering  soldiers  quartering  soldiers  quartering  soldiers  that's an  oldie  I have no  idea  I think a  soldier is  allowed to  come into 
[01:38:30]  your house  and take a  nap  oh quartering  I thought  you meant  pull them apart  chop them apart  in four pieces  give them change  for the meter  I was thinking  Braveheart  I'm like  Braveheart  the Third  Amendment  is Braveheart  are they allowed  to hang out  no soldier  shall in the  time of peace  be quartered  in any house  without the  consent of the  owner  nor in time  of war  but in a  manner prescribed  by law  that's why  nobody knows  what the  Third Amendment  is  before that  they were  just able  to kind  of  come in  a little 
[01:39:00]  sleepy  and we'll  use this  house  there's some  great houses  out there  how cool  would that  be  kick it  in  go ahead  you gotta  put me up  for the night  sorry  I don't care  you're having  a webcam  party  I'm tired  there  Anthony  now you know  why we have  the Second Amendment  otherwise you'd  have a bunch  of soldiers  with guns  coming in  and taking  over your  house  there you  go  sleeping  now we're  rocking  good morning  everybody  what's up  Boston  what's slapping 
[01:39:30]  in Cleveland  New York  in the house  and Cape Cod  I thought it was  kicking in there  I know  the vocals  are coming  here they  come  come on  why doesn't  it ever  kick in  I want to  do a single  here it  comes  here it  now  it'll never 
[01:40:00]  happen  877-212-ON-A  I want to  say hi  to Norfolk  I like to  say Norfolk  some people  say it  almost cursing  I know  Norfolk  Norfolk  or Norf  I like to  say Norfolk  how do you  say it  where it  almost  sounds like  you're cursing  yeah  Norfolk  Norfolk  Norfolk  Virginia is how  you say it  yeah  there you go  oh wonderful 
[01:40:30]  this is perfect  we were just  talking about  what  guns  and Democrats  and planes  and a little  dog named  Snuggles  sure  Archie  Bunker  said everyone  straight back  in the day  this was  probably one  of the  more memorable  Archie Bunker  speeches  that he gave  this is when  remember they  used to have  editorials  on TV  the general  manager of a 
[01:41:00]  station  just kind of  reads something  he'd be like  ah this is on  you know  maybe guns  or something  else  some charity  thing  and then  they gave  regular  Joe  the opportunity  to come on  the station  sit down  and give a  rebuttal  to one of the  statements  that were made  and there you are  just some regular  Joe on TV  talking about it  Channel 11 used  to do it here in  New York all the  time  yeah when a  thousand people  were watching  yeah  was nothing  well they  ran with that  on all in the 
[01:41:30]  family  on a gun  control issue  and Archie  Bunker  was doing the  rebuttal on  and he was the  pro gun  side of it  and some of the  stuff he said  is classic  literally  speaking of the  first amendment  you don't get  shows like  Archie Bunker  anymore  no no  all in the  family type  programming  too risque  too politically  incorrect  some of the  stuff you hear  the race based  humor on those  shows are  hysterical 
[01:42:00]  and just  would be  completely  taboo  boycotted  now  people would  get fired  if it  ever made  it onto  TV  hell yeah  it's too  bad  oh my god  say this  stuff on  radio  you certainly  would be  fired  here's  Archie Bunker  on gun  control  back in  the day  late 70s  right  somewhere  maybe  early  mid  yeah  let's go  with early  to mid  good evening  everybody  this is  Archie Bunker  of 704  Houser Street  veteran of the  big war  speaking on  behalf of  guns for  everybody  now 
[01:42:30]  question  what was the  first thing  that the  communists  done when  they took  over in  Russia  answer  gun control  and there's  a lot of  people in  this country  want to do  the same  thing  to us  here  in a  kind of  conspiracy  see  take your  big  international  bankers  they want  to  masticate  the people  of this  here  nation  like  puppets  on a  wing  and then  when they  get that  done  to the  commies  he's  brilliant  the damn  commies  god damn 
[01:43:00]  is he funny  and he was  such a liberal  carol o'connor  yeah  the absolute  opposite  of Archie Bunker  now I want  to talk about  another thing  that's on  everybody's  mind  today  and that's  your stick  ups  and your  skyjackers  which  if that  was up to  me  I could  end  the skyjackers  tomorrow  all you  gotta do  is arm  all your  passengers  all your  pants  he ain't  got no  more  superiority  there  he ain't  gonna dare  to pull  out no  rod  and then  your  airlines  they wouldn't  have to 
[01:43:30]  chase the  passengers  on the  ground  no more  they just  pass out  the pistols  at the  beginning  of the  trip  and then  pick them  up again  at the  end  that's  brilliant  we should have  listened to Archie  30 some odd  years ago  who's gonna pull  out a rod  a rod  and I forgot  it was called  skyjackers  skyjacking  skyjacking  hijacking  was a truck  a highway  yep  yeah  they used to  call them  skyjackers  forgot about that  pass out the pistols  at the beginning  of the trip  and then you collect  them up at the end  and then 
[01:44:00]  this is what he had to say  about Democrats  right  well the Democrats  way of running this  country is to go  tell us all  how we ought to  make sacrifices  god they're  great on that  stuff  but they're all  gonna have us  over the hill  to the poorhouse  we ain't gonna  be able to  drive over there  because we ain't  got no gas  so we're gonna  have to walk it  oh  the Reader's  Digest says  walking is  very good  for you  oh ain't 
[01:44:30]  that lovely  the Reader's  Digest can always  put a little  joy  into poverty  my whole  pain is this  whole thing  with the energy  and everything  this is all  a conspiracy  don't you know  that is a conspiracy  there  listen  for years  all our lives  they've been  telling us  to go out  and buy stuff  that use  energy  you know  all the electrical  stuff  electric toasters  electric covers  electric stove  electric stereo  electric TV  electric race  electric hairblower  electric knives  electric every damn 
[01:45:00]  thing  not to mention  the cars  and now  after all the  big corporations  there make  the billions  and billions  of dollars  worth of profits  signals  wham  they're changed  and they're telling us  for years  that we can't live  without this junk  now they tell us  that we gotta  live without it  the country  is going straight  into the dumper  that could have been  said yesterday  that's amazing  that could have been  said yesterday  same effing problems  why are we even  arguing  it's the same crap  exactly  that is the same  issue as today  same crap  so why are we even 
[01:45:30]  waste energy  talking about this  it is what it is  it's just gonna  stay that way  absolutely  I can't wait  to be a solar power  completely  and they're like  you're using  too much of the sun  the sun  is getting  tired  so there you go  yeah  on the family  that's pretty cool  very timely  it's unbelievable  can I recommend  something I saw  this weekend  that really bothered me  I'm not into  transvestites  I said bothered me  I know 
[01:46:00]  that's what I  I conjured up  the thought  before you said  bothered me  and that's why  I stuttered on it  it's like  that wouldn't bother  Jimmy  transsexual  not transvestites  that's queer  I saw  on HBO  on demand  there's a special  on a guy  who was convicted  wrongly  1984 black guy  for raping  and killing  a white woman  it's called  The Trials  Daryl Hunt  you gotta see it  I saw the one  about Michael  really they  railroaded the guy 
[01:46:30]  it was  but it happened  in 84  in like  I think  north of South Carolina  I mean this wasn't  like the 60s  or the 50s  yeah  the evidence  was so  awful  all along  it just  it's  wow  disgraceful  it's like  the things  the black people  were saying  about healing  in the community  that like  always annoys me  when I hear it now  it's like  because you know  the guy is innocent  before the documentary  starts  it's like  it doesn't annoy you  when you're hearing it  in this  it's like  I don't know  they didn't pick him up  because he had a  past of rape  or anything like that  no  okay 
[01:47:00]  alright  because you know  nothing  I get a little  like I don't care  if they're innocent  if they were doing it before  and that's why  they picked him up  but  it was  it was a totally  bogus thing  and this happened  in the 80s  he did 20  years  how do you do  that time knowing  standing on my head  they were fighting  for the death penalty  and they didn't get it  the jury didn't give him  the death penalty  but had he been given  the death penalty  he absolutely would have  been executed  and people are like  well that proves  the system works  but that's not what it proves  because when you watch 
[01:47:30]  what finally happened  it makes you want to  just vomit  so  well you know  the whole  the thing with DNA evidence  now  is really  for both sides  it's done very well  in convicting criminals  and freeing up  innocent ones  but it really did  that technology  kind of came around  relatively recently  you know  where it's  it's very exact  faster than it used to be  but back then  wow  somebody said  you done it 
[01:48:00]  you done it  you done it  they used DNA  I think in 1990  they had DNA  yeah  of course the prosecutors  lied and said  that it was  not good enough  to step up  some kind of wizardry  early on  with DNA evidence  they would  the prosecution  would usually  try to make it  sound like  some kind of  I don't know  crazy  and the jury  couldn't understand it  what is this  why  this guy was  cleared in 94 
[01:48:30]  by the DNA  and it took him  another 10 years  to ram it through  the system down there  and release him  oh my god  yeah  it was  it's disgusting  and it's like  when you look at  the way the prosecutors  handled that case  and then you look at  like Nifong  the guy in the  Duke rape case  even prosecutors  are dirty men  what happened to the guy  in the documentary  you saw  did he sue  did he get anything  out of this  I would rather  let people watch it  but I will say  I'll check it out  yeah dude  it's so  it's so good  but you know  before going in 
[01:49:00]  he was wrongly convicted  so the whole time  you're just aggravated  no no no  you know that going  that's why I watched it  alright  hold on  Ellie from Jersey  Ellie  what's up guys  hey  how could you say  there's nothing on TV  that's not  that's not  I'm trying to think  of the word  but you have family  guys on TV  it's so wrong  on so many  only cartoons though  only cartoons buddy  cartoons are  that's the problem  we have with that stuff  how about real people  acting like the cartoons do 
[01:49:30]  where you can say things  that are politically incorrect  and you could say  use racial humor  how about that  I love family guy  but it bothers us  that only cartoons  are allowed to do  this type of humor  and if you're a real  person like Dan was  just saying  it's off limits  that's insane  in our society  we become such a country  of like girls  little sissy men  that we can't handle  people saying things  we don't like  I mean that's what  just a little 
[01:50:00]  sissy nation we are  we have to have cartoons  say things that are  possibly offensive  if the founding fathers  don't we were today  they'd be rolling  in their graves  alright  nah they wouldn't either  because they had  those things  they didn't want you  saying too  if they would have  seen two guys  holding hands  the founding fathers  would have been  too keen on it  I mean look  they did a lot  but they were  kind of douchey too  they would have  seen MTV  and hung themselves  I love when people  talk about the  family fathers  and the founding fathers 
[01:50:30]  excuse me  and what they would  be doing  know what they'd be  doing  they would have  a kickass penthouse  here in Manhattan  they'd be rocking  and rolling  rolling up to the club  in some kind of limo  with a girl  on a girl  on each arm  and a slave  driving a car  yeah  that's what they would  have done  yeah you think  they would be  do-gooders  in the year 2008  they would be  they were slave owners  yes they were  all of them were  they would be  sucked right into  our culture  and enjoying  every minute of it  boy Carlin  and God bless  Carlin man  and one of his  where he just  look of course 
[01:51:00]  the founding fathers  are you know  look we're here  but he just  tears into  what a frauds  they were  and they were  land owning  slave owners  who said that  only their class  can vote  you know he's  completely truthful  women couldn't vote  blacks couldn't vote  you know they just  can't look at them  as these  infallible  perfect gentlemen  that's how they  portray them  just because  every picture  you see  every painting  you see  they're all  gathered around  the documents  looking all regal  yes this is  what we'll  on their off hours 
[01:51:30]  you know Jefferson  was out back  plowing the help  meanwhile you don't  know what they  were actually  signing  they could have  been signed  now we can  kill blacks  if they  no we can't  that's what  they were arguing  I would imagine  wonder what they  were doing  when this picture  was painted  I imagine they  had a few  bonfires like  getting rid of  some evidence  of other things  they signed  absolutely  yes  old school  paper shredder  get the fire  going  now that we're  known as do-gooders  we better get  rid of a few  files  burning books  bunch of asses  with high white  sissy stockings  cut it out

[02:01:30]  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Eatabullet.com for Jimmy.  You don't like that Eatabullet anymore.  What's going on with that?  Every time I bring up Eatabullet, you go, no.  Because I have to fix the website.  And the website hosting, there were so many problems with the site that got built. 
[02:02:00]  I had some new work done to it.  It's just crap, dude.  Oh, no.  So we're pushing everyone toward your MySpace page.  I wasted so much money recently in the last year.  I want to go on a murder spree.  On your webpage?  Dude, it makes me...  Why isn't it, like, good?  I want to kill people.  Yeah.  All right.  No crap.  It sucks.  Let's, uh...  Nobody does what they say they're going to do.  What? 
[02:02:30]  Nobody does what they say they're going to do.  No.  Oh, my God, no.  We were talking about incompetence and just...  No one gets the job done right anymore.  You got to do it yourself.  It doesn't get...  And then you got to...  You know, you can't get a hold of people.  Nope.  I hate everybody involved with computers.  So go to my MySpace because my website stinks.  Yeah.  Hey, um...  We didn't even talk about Chuck Liddell getting knocked out.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  What happened?  Rashad Evans.  I told you, man. 
[02:03:00]  He's undefeated.  He had 10 years on Chuck.  Mm-hmm.  He caught him.  I mean, he was out.  Knocked him out cold.  Completely out cold.  Wow.  I was hoping to get Dana White on the show today, but I don't think that's going to happen.  I think him and Chuck went to Cancun, I heard.  That they flew today, actually.  They might be on a plane.  Or yesterday.  But Chuck had to go to the hospital and...  He's all right.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's okay.  And I was talking to his manager, Reed.  And we were texting.  I'm like, I think he's going to retire.  Because that was a bad knockout.  And he's like, no, no.  He'll probably just readjust like he had to for the... 
[02:03:30]  What did he catch him with?  A right.  A right?  Did he follow it up with anything?  Or just one right put him down?  Yeah, walking away.  Chuck was...  Yeah, walking away.  Chuck was so unconscious.  It was like...  You've got to see the wow.  He went to walk over him and the ref just stopped.  And the ref knew, I think, before he hit the mat that he was out.  Yeah, you've got to see the...  Damn!  It's up on YouTube already, right?  I don't know.  We'll probably link it on onaradio.com.  I was watching a lousy feed of it.  No.  And then it cut out right before the knockout.  When I saw it, I saw Chuck Liddell walk out. 
[02:04:00]  And he had a gut a little bit that was kind of hanging over his shorts a little.  He didn't look in the best shape he's ever been.  And that's for sure.  Why don't you tell Chuck that next time he's in here?  No, that's why I say it now.  Well, I'll say...  And then I'll deny it.  I'll certainly save the tape.  Is this the...  Yeah, it's two cats.  ...knockout?  These dumb YouTubers.  We clicked on one of the Chuck Liddell links and it was two cats fighting.  Thank you.  No, it's just like the celebration after the knockout. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  We've got a couple things we could squeeze in here.  We've got a pastor saying, I kissed a girl video is pornographic.  What?  What's her name?  Katie something?  Perry.  Katie Perry.  Katie Perry.  It's a hot song.  And then you've got Gary Coleman hitting a fan with his car.  Where do you want to go?  Oh, we found the video?  Dude.  I think I'm looking at it.  Watch this.  Evans just catches him, man.  I know it's radio, but watch this.  Oh.  Right on the button.  Good night.  And Liddell is completely uncalled. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, he got him right square in the chin.  That must have knocked his jaw back.  He is knocked out cold.  Wow, Liddell had his left hand down.  His arms are really...  His arms...  I think that's how Rampage Jackson caught him, too.  His arms just...  Dude.  ...down sometimes.  What the hell was he thinking?  I think the league, like I was pointing, I think a lot of them...  A lot of the league.  A lot of them have him figured out because they've been watching him fight for so many years,  so he has to make some...  His left arm is not even close to defending that punch.  Look at the shape Evans is in.  Yeah.  It's easy to play a Monday morning quarterback, but it really looks like... 
[02:05:30]  That arm is just not anywhere near up to protect him from a right.  Yeah, Rashad Evans, a really well-built fella.  He popped him...  Square.  ...square in the jaw.  And that's it.  And boy, did he go down.  God almighty.  Chuck just took a nap.  He must have woke up like, where...  What's happening?  Why would you ever want to do that for a living, where your job is to either...  Holy...  Dude, the way he wound up for that punch, like he... 
[02:06:00]  He jabbed with a left, and it only gave him more momentum for that right.  It was like a roundhouse.  Oh, he came around and pounded him.  It was a roundhouse as square on the jaw as you've ever seen anybody punched.  How does that not shatter your jaw, by the way?  Dude, it might have.  If any of us are hit like that in this studio, it's...  If I got my face...  It's over.  If I got my face punched like that, it would break my feet.  I think so.  How do these guys take a punch like that? 
[02:06:30]  It's amazing.  You just gotta be born differently.  They got it from every angle.  And the angle from the back, you see his neck almost contort.  It like twists and bends.  He should have snapped his neck with that punch.  That's a sick punch.  It's up on YouTube.  We'll link it.  Wow.  You linked it already?  Yeah.  All right.  It's linked on onaradio.com.  You can check it out for yourself.  Hey, let's...  You want to squeeze in the pastor saying,  I kissed a girl is pornographic or Gary Coleman hitting a fan with a car?  I would say the pornographic. 
[02:07:00]  Gary Coleman's just a little...  I like that.  ...little fella.  He's just an angry little fella.  What does he know?  He's tiny.  He's a tiny little guy, and he's had it with everybody.  Of course he has.  He's tired of his...  What was his bad kidneys and his rotten parents and his dwarfism?  His dwarfism.  He should have died many years ago.  He's just...  I know.  He's still alive, and he shouldn't be.  You're right.  That should have been one of those...  Aw.  Poor Gary Coleman.  Now he's just an annoying, angry, short guy.  Well, he can't do anything except ironically play the tough mobster. 
[02:07:30]  Uh-oh.  Mr. Big is coming.  Oh, no.  Look at who it is.  We get it.  I'm a nothing.  He's not big.  I'm a cat turd with facial features.  That's all he can do.  Or, where's your boyfriend?  Here he comes.  Woo!  Oh, yeah.  It's Gary Coleman.  Oh, the tough boyfriend.  We get it because he's a baby in man brain.  He stinks.  And he's so angry.  He's a...  Somebody's trying to, I guess, take a picture. 
[02:08:00]  And, uh...  Damn.  He got all mad.  Well, we could do that.  I should be happy.  Well, why don't we squeeze that in?  Yeah, squeeze in that goddamn shorty.  Oh, there we go.  Gary Coleman, believe it or not, is quite strong.  You might want to think twice if you want to try to take a picture of him.  Because a former child star reportedly hit a fan with his car during an argument at a Utah bowling alley.  His bodyguard claims the fan refused to back down after Coleman declined to take a picture. 
[02:08:30]  But the fan says Coleman's wife snapped his cell phone.  Was he appearing as a pin?  And that Coleman punched him several times before getting behind the wheel.  Police say the incident is still under investigation.  Coleman punched him, huh?  That's right.  That's a meme punch.  Why won't he take a picture?  Gary, what are you doing?  Why wouldn't he take a picture?  You're in a Utah bowling alley.  You should be happy someone recognized in a Utah bowling alley.  Why won't you take a picture?  What else are you doing besides just being a laughingstock? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, everyone laughs at you.  That's why he's so angry.  How old is he now?  72.  Wow.  He was 50 when he did Different Strokes.  And Conrad Bain is actually 35 today.  He was 14 when he did that show.  Different Strokes humor.  I'm loving it.  Yes.  And Dana Plateau is having a headache examined.  Jesus.  She must look awful by now, huh?  Oh, duffel bag full of Vicodin.  She didn't look good then.  Coleman just turned 40.  Wow. 
[02:09:30]  40?  Wow.  He looks young, though.  Looks like a kid.  I want to kiss his cheeks against his will.  Like, hug him and just...  I want to molest him a little.  Like, make the smoochy sound on his face.  Oh, he would hate that.  Oh, he would.  Come on.  He'd try to punch you, but...  He can only punch people that allow him to punch them, I think.  Like, there's no way Gary Coleman's getting one in on you if you expect it and don't want  to be punched by Gary Coleman.  If I was a billionaire, I would put up a fight. 
[02:10:00]  Rashad Evans versus Gary Coleman.  Or Fedor versus Coleman.  Oh, that'd be great.  Full contact face punching.  And I would pay the beach.  Gary Coleman would be like, he'll kill me.  10 million.  All right.  I'll do it.  Then he does it.  Yes.  Winds up completely, profoundly retarded.  I'd make him a green wig.  I'd make him wear a green Oompa Loompa wig.  And he would have to walk around the ring like an Oompa Loompa, like with the way they  would...  And he would have to go like, doop-a-dee-doo, with no mouth guard at all. 
[02:10:30]  Make him come out to that music.  Yes.  He would have to say, doop-a-dee-doo, Oompa.  And he would just have to keep saying that as he walked around the ring in that stupid  Oompa Loompa gait.  And then Fedor could just be himself.  He should just completely do with them what Hervé Villages did.  Just lean against that glass door.  Ow.  It hurts.  Lunta.  All right. 
[02:11:00]  Here's a pastor having a problem with...  Katy Perry?  Katy Perry?  What's that?  How do you say her name?  Katy Perry, probably.  I gotta be honest.  Yeah.  We didn't intend to get into all this, but it's become, you know, a bigger thing.  Pastor David Allison says Katy Perry's video is borderline pornographic and flaunts homosexuality.  Hey, man, it's Nick.  If anybody sees the video and understands how lewd and suggested the video is for this song, 
[02:11:30]  that is not something that young people should easily go towards.  So Allison decided the Haven's Corners Church would broadcast its own message.  For 24 hours, the reader board read like this.  I kissed a girl and I liked it.  Then I went to hell.  That's right.  H-E double hockey sticks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing how they don't...  It's funny how they never on those church boards put, I was a pastor, I raped a child,  I'm in hell.  Yeah.  They never self-police or self-critique on those silly church message boards. 
[02:12:00]  This is just bad.  It's lesbianism being promoted and you'll go to hell.  How about I'm a cardinal, I look the other way, I'm in hell.  How about that?  I'm a pope, I apologized, 40 years too late for the Holocaust, I'm in hell.  This Katy Perry should be praised.  You know how many women are turning to lesbianism because of her?  I think girls always kissing other girls.  Well, now they're really kissing each other because this is a huge pop song.  They're just kissing each other.  It's a good one.  Then I went to hell. 
[02:12:30]  Allison's received emails from across the state.  If we don't stand up for God's word in the Bible, we are not doing this work.  Those folks want to say Jesus would never have such an unloving message.  Equality Ohio says the message is shocking, but legal.  It's a shock pasture.  Pastor.  Pasture.  It happens.  It's a shocking grass and field.  Cow duty is that there are over 300 welcoming and affirming churches across Ohio.  We love homosexuals, but if they come to our church, they will hear that just like an 
[02:13:00]  adulterer or someone else that commits a sin that the Bible defines as a sin, those things  have to be repented of.  Once again, when the church boards start really crucifying priests and the behaviors of the  literally crucifying them would be nice in front of the church.  It's amazing how they don't find it.  It's always the pop stuff.  They're as bad as anybody else with their stupid safe targets.  Yeah.  They stink.  I kissed a girl and I liked it. 
[02:13:30]  And now I'm going to hell.  Jesus would love lesbians.  I don't think I'm taking a big change.  He was a radical.  Yeah.  Long hair and a beard.  Yeah.  Just walking the earth.  He was a radical.  He would have been in Woodstock watching the girls getting it on in the mud.  Oh, he would have loved the action.  When you're referring to some part of a person that is part of who they are, kind of like  your personality, and then that that is somehow sinful, which I do not agree with, that's  difficult for people. 
[02:14:00]  The church took the message down yesterday, they say, because not everyone understood  the cultural reference.  They replaced it with one that talks about forgiving sins, while the rest of the world  debates what one really is.  I've just been watching the video that Danny's had up, and I can't stop watching it.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  That's a good video.  One of the hottest songs out there right now.  Yeah.  She performed it last night, VMA.  Did she?  Did they do a little stage show?  Did they have girls coming out and kissing each other or anything? 
[02:14:30]  No.  I was on too late.  I don't know.  I also heard she redid Like a Virgin, because it's been 25 years since Madonna did that song.  Oh, great.  So she redid that last night.  I'm going to get that damn song.  Yeah.  For the old iPod, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You like it?  I really am a teenage girl.  Are you?  I like that song.  Want to come to my house?  You can stay at my house.  Yes, I'll take off my clothes.  Take your clothes off, please. 
[02:15:00]  He's a fool.  Are you dipping into the teens, then?  No.  No.  Staying off the...  Why?  Staying away from the teens.  I don't know.  I haven't had an offer yet.  No.  Barely legals.  Barely legals.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  All right.  We did a lot today.  Yes. 
[02:15:30]  And there's more to come.  What?  We're going to walk the surreyous XMradio.  I'm shedding my regionalism.  Buffoon.  You say it, man.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their off- 
[02:16:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Shock Jocks.  Go screw.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah.  This is where entertainment is going.  So you've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through.  Where icing was.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And good morning.  Welcome to the satellite portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I'm going to turn my headphones down a little.  That was boisterous.  How many days are we up to? 
[02:17:30]  What?  As we work things out, 22 days.  Oh.  22 days.  Hey, do we cut it a bit short, are we, Bob?  Deuce.  Deuce.  Hey, Bob, aren't we cutting it a bit short?  Hey there, Bob.  Bob?  Bobby.  When is that thing you were saying coming out?  That's really good news.  Oh, it's on Orbicast.com.  There's an app coming out for the satellite radio star player.  What's the app?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's for Windows.  That's not the app.  What?  Oh, it's a Windows thing?  Yeah, I think this is what you're talking about.  Hold on, man. 
[02:18:00]  What?  Yeah, I think this is what you're talking about, but it's not for iPhone.  It's for Windows.  I'd never say it was for iPhone, by the way.  Somebody else did.  Star player for Windows.  Hands down, the best serious slash XM internet radio player to date.  And it's coming out soon.  There's a whole article on Orbicast.  Orbicast.com.  Can I clear something up?  Clear something up.  It kind of goes with...  Do you have a blame-ish?  It kind of goes with what Ant was saying earlier to start the show.  Just people in general that don't get it. 
[02:18:30]  People.  Or they hear just a little piece of the radio show, and then they think they know how the show works.  Well, they can even hear a lot of it.  They know the personalities.  Right.  And they think they know.  They just don't know.  Crap.  There's so many people that don't understand why I brought in my old video demo.  What?  They're making fun of me and stuff.  I'm like, dude, the whole reason I brought it in was so I could be thrown under the bus.  I'm not looking at that like, wow, look at me.  I was howling laughing.  Yeah, I should be the host of American Idol instead of Ryan Seacrest. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, I brought it in to get killed.  Do they really not get that?  Does someone not get it?  There's so many people that don't get it, and they're trying to abuse me over it.  I'm like, don't even.  Don't try to.  What was an example of not getting it?  Yeah, how are they abusing it?  Like, oh, he brought that in, and then what's the bitch that they had?  And they think that I thought it was, like, good.  It is.  Yeah.  It is.  Conditioning to be a douche.  It's good if you want to be.  It was good for throwing me under the bus. 
[02:19:30]  That's the difference.  I guess because there's not a lot of radio shows that are so willing to throw themselves  under the bus.  It's a big part of this show.  I think there's a lot of radio shows and TV shows and stuff.  They protect their image.  They protect what they're all about, I guess.  We sure ain't into that.  No, so they don't want to show the underbelly and the scars and how damaged the personalities  truly are on this radio show?  That's why I brought it in.  So if you're sitting there trying to make fun of me, you're missing the point. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Are they making fun of you like it was really bad?  I don't want to go over, like, yes.  No, no, no, but I mean, are they saying, hey, that was really awful?  Do they at least, they don't get like you brought it in because you thought it was awful?  No, no.  That's the point I'm making.  No.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  I can't comprehend someone being that stupid.  Exactly.  It amazes me.  It's like when I play my old sets with the fun of listening to you guys, it's because  we're going over, I think someone said it's called asshole infinity syndrome years ago.  Every year you look back and always an asshole then.  Asshole infinity syndrome.  Yeah, forget where I heard that.  Oh, that's funny. 
[02:20:30]  Something like that.  But it's like you look back over your old work and you always cringe.  That's what we do.  You're always going to look like an asshole.  Except for me.  You know what?  I just turned the instant feedback on.  This is perfect.  914, Kevin C. Queens.  Just saw your old footage, Opie.  Don't know if you'd do it now, but you can never make fun of Ryan C.  Crest ever.  Why?  Why can't I?  But is he shitting on you or just kind of breaking balls with you?  Well, there's some people breaking balls because they understand the beauty of the show, but  then there's other people that don't understand. 
[02:21:00]  They're like, you look like a complete idiot.  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I brought it in.  It's for the object.  That's the reason I brought it in.  We all have those.  Yeah, I know that.  Oh, my God.  Ah, whatever.  Just wanted to like just finally acknowledge that because people like, yeah.  Like my girl said, don't bring that in.  I'm like, why?  This will be great.  They'll throw me under the bus.  It'll make for a good segment on the show.  She goes, why do you like being uncomfortable?  I'm like, I don't know, but it's also good for the show.  Yeah.  It was.  And that's why I did it.  Horrific.  I look like an idiot. 
[02:21:30]  My pants are pulled up too high.  I look like I'm 14 years old.  If it looked good, who the fuck would want to see it?  Yeah.  Hey, let me bring this in.  It's slick and I look great.  And we'd sit there and go, oh, okay.  Nice.  I was barely out of college when, ah, whatever.  But whatever.  I just wanted to say that.  All right.  Hey, is I can't.  I can't believe you.  The fuck them.  Anyone that wouldn't understand the funny part of that is just ridiculous.  Look at this poor motherfucker.  I know.  We got one guy out there.  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  He's always one guy. 
[02:22:00]  I recognize you.  Yeah.  He's a, he's one guy, dude.  He's one guy, dude.  One guy, dude.  Oh, I had a point to wrap it up, but no.  Oh, damn it.  Ah, whatever.  I don't get it.  I don't care.  Ah, there's an, I don't care, but ah, whatever.  Fuck it.  It doesn't matter.  Hey, is I going to hit New Orleans?  I just saw the latest graphic on the news and it's heading, it's kind of following the 
[02:22:30]  same pattern as Gustav.  Yeah.  Like Turner, I'm sure he'd love to.  Like slightly more, uh, West.  Yeah.  Than Gustav.  But it's, it's heading in that same general direction.  Direction.  And they love showing that.  Like, even if they know it's really not, they'll put New Orleans in kind of the edge  of the, uh, possible strike area just so people can go, oh, oh, I got to watch.  Yeah.  They want another frigging disaster so bad. 
[02:23:00]  Yep.  The American people.  We love our real entertainment.  You know, you can't just blame the media.  I think as a human being, you just enjoy disaster.  You do.  You, you secretly hope for crazy shit to happen as long as it doesn't happen to you or your  loved ones.  It doesn't affect you or the people.  Yeah.  You love, you're, you're fine with it.  That's like a movie.  It's, it's, yeah.  It's a little action movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I'm tired today, man.  I fucking was dealing with like nightmares all night.  Fucking hate nightmares.  I was having a discussion with Anthony about nightmares.  It's the weirdest fucking thing. 
[02:23:30]  When you're having them, it's the scariest shit ever.  Did you dream Steve was our executive producer?  Oh shit.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare.  Gee, baby, your video made me sweat.  I was so uncomfortable.  I loved it.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the type of thing.  But to say, hey, you look like an idiot.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  That's where we start.  That's where we start, you idiot.  But then like when you wake up, you're, everything's all right.  But when you're in the moment and just kind of sort of waking up from a nightmare, you're 
[02:24:00]  still creeped out.  It's, it's the weirdest fucking feeling.  I don't know.  I dig the shit out of nightmares.  Do you really?  I love having them.  I love even when they are happening, like, and cause they're so fucking frightening sometimes  or you're in, mine are always, and I've talked about this in the past, are always, I'm in  such big fucking trouble.  I am in life changing, you're going to prison for years trouble.  Where are you?  In Tel Aviv?  Oops.  Do you ever see the killer in yours? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I see the bad guys all the time.  I don't.  They chase me.  I can't run.  I go to shoot the fucking, I go to shoot them and like, I have the wrong ammo.  So you actually see the face of your oppressor.  Oh yeah, yeah.  The bad guy.  They're like by the windows sometimes.  I never see the face.  Or I'll be in a house and usually it's some house I used to live in fucking like years  ago and the door will be open to crack and I'm like, who the fuck left the door open?  So I'll lunge to shut the door and right when I do, somebody else is on the other side pushing 
[02:25:00]  it and they get in the house and then I run out the back door and I'm trying to fucking  run away and you know how running is in dreams.  Jesus Christ.  This doesn't work.  Do most people see the killer in their dreams or not?  I don't know.  I mean it goes back and forth.  Like sometimes I will and other times I won't.  Sometimes you will.  I never, ever do.  That's what makes it so creepy.  Where is this person?  When I've killed somebody and I just like fucking remember it.  That I was involved in some kind of murder or involved in disposing of the body or something 
[02:25:30]  and then and then like I find out the cops are on to it and I think back and go, oh  my God, I left so much fucking like physical evidence that I was there.  They're going to be coming and asking questions.  What am I going to say?  I'm going to fucking go to jail.  I can't believe this.  I'm going to fucking prison and then you wake up and go, oh, I'm out of trouble.  That is the greatest feeling ever.  Oh, that was easy because I was in a pretty big jam there.  Your nightmare is one big anxiety attack and you wake up and go, oh my God, I was just  dreaming.  But it also works the other way. 
[02:26:00]  Unfortunately, those top awesome sex dreams.  You're like, what?  That's not real.  It's only happened a couple of times, but there is nothing better than just waking up in a  puddle of your own cum after you're dreaming.  And it's like, you wake up, you're like, oh my God, I dreamt I was fucking some chicken.  I came.  Holy shit.  I'm laying in my own cum.  You know, I don't, I don't talk about my, my past relationship that much, but I'll tell 
[02:26:30]  you this much.  I miss being in a miserable relationship because of what you just described.  Oh, because you don't fuck for a long time.  Nope.  So those moments where you wake up and you're like, holy crap, that was the coolest thing  ever.  Yeah.  I don't have those type of dreams anymore.  No, no, you just, I'm in a good relationship.  I'm really good.  You blow dust out your dick.  Right, right, right.  Just do my fucking.  But that's one thing I miss about being in a miserable relationship right there.  Yep.  The fucking sex dream.  The lack of sex.  And then after a while, you start, if you're too like lazy to jerk off for like a while. 
[02:27:00]  Well, yeah.  And then you just.  Well, I got into a pattern where the sex dreams were so cool that I would hold out.  And then it was like winning the lottery.  You don't know what night it's going to happen.  Here it comes.  I'm serious though.  All of a sudden you're like, holy shit.  Time to disperse some poison.  It, you know, it's really fucked up.  The mind really, I'm not saying anything fucking groundbreaking here, is really fucking amazing.  Because it can actually give you the feeling that you're slowly slipping your dick in a wet pussy. 
[02:27:30]  Because when you're dreaming, when you're having a wet dream, and you start fucking, when you slip in, there is no difference than being in real life and doing the same fucking thing.  Sure there is.  In the dream, there's no screaming or duct tape.  Fucking mace in your face.  She's a little thinner in the dream.  You can get your arms around her.  That's why they call it a dream. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  But yeah, you can actually, your fucking mind makes you feel that physically.  Which is enough where you fucking shoot a load.  And I would start walking around feeling like heavy.  A little plumped up.  A little plumped up, a little heavy.  And I knew that any day now, the sex dream wasn't coming.  And I would get a little more pep in my step.  God, people thought we had the world by the balls.  We were so fucking miserable back then.  The balls were all full of cum.  Yeah, they were.  Don't touch them. 
[02:28:30]  It's amazing.  I can't, I don't know if I've ever had a wet dream.  I mean, I may have.  You're too fucking crazy with cumming every day.  The amount of jerking off you're doing, you don't even give yourself a chance.  Because I think you have to go without it for, how long do you think?  It's probably a week.  I would say maybe even more, man.  I've gone 17 days is the longest I've gone in my adult life that I can remember.  I didn't dump it anymore.  Without dumping at all?  Yeah.  How'd you fucking do that?  It was one of my times I was trying to stop it.  Were you trying?  That's a little excessive.  I'm going to try again, too, starting today.  I'm just, I'm fucking beating.  Can we see how long you last? 
[02:29:00]  Did you jerk off last night?  Yeah, that's a yes.  If that's what you want to call it.  More like I grabbed my dick like it owed me money.  I fucking strangled it.  I was angry at my, I kind of grabbed it.  It was weak and it wilted.  And yet I held on to it for dear life.  As if it were the fucking, it was a break on a runaway train.  I literally, I fucking came so hard last night.  It was a four squirter. 
[02:29:30]  And I hit myself in the nostril.  Wow.  And that was trying to control it.  Like I was not trying to shoot over my head.  Right.  My nickname is fucking the cum kid.  I don't doubt it.  I'm going to videotape myself arcing a load someday.  Yeah.  And figure out a way to get it up on a site without my dick involved, of course.  You can arc a lot better jerking off than in any other circumstance.  She's sucking it.  It just bubbles out and barely gets between her teeth.  Fucking, it pulls up in her cheek or like a pinch of tobacco. 
[02:30:00]  Pinch between your chicken gum for real cum pleasure.  Yeah, fucking, like a fucking, a skull between the, let's see how many days you can go, Jimmy.  No, but I want to stop everything.  Like really, really.  Yeah.  I've been trying to fucking deal with this, man.  It's been driving me nuts.  And I do okay, I did like a week last week, maybe five or six days with nothing.  No porn, no nothing.  It's fucking hard, man.  That's so odd. 
[02:30:30]  I could go through phases of acting like that, but then it'll stop and I won't, you know,  I won't do it.  Yesterday was lost.  Really?  Just the fucking.  The whole day was lost.  Trying to find the ideal situation for the ideal fucking orgasm.  Is that what you.  Dude, and then I shot what could have been foam on a brush fire.  I literally, if my load would have been fucking, if there was a flaming building, I would have  arced my load on it and saved a few people. 
[02:31:00]  Fucking shoot it on a runway when the plane has no landing gear.  It was frothy cumzies.  And then a couple hours later, there I am again.  It was fucking, I was so disgusted with myself yesterday, man.  Wow.  It was such a beautiful day.  You should have been outside.  You should have been jerking off outside.  I woke up at two.  I mean, I went to bed at seven.  All right.  A little fucking sunscreen on the head of your dick.  You're outside jerking off.  Sunscreen.  I shot a line of it up to my nose.  I had like one little tan line up my fucking throat.  And then I did fucking jiggle free abs because I couldn't stop jerking off. 
[02:31:30]  I couldn't get down to the gym before it closed.  That's why I couldn't get down there.  Oh, jerking off.  Yeah.  Ruined my day.  Disgusting myself.  Oh, we get this one.  Jim in Connecticut.  Jim.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Jim.  Well, I have a nightmare that I think Ant can relate to the most.  I'm an NRA instructor.  And in my dreams, my gun never works when I need it to.  Or the bullets just lob out.  Dude, cops have those dreams a lot, I heard. 
[02:32:00]  Where the bullets just kind of bubble out slowly.  Yeah, it's the worst fucking thing.  Because every dream I have where I have a gun, I have ammo that does not fit the gun.  Or, yeah, you'll pull the trigger.  And sometimes the trigger won't pull.  And then sometimes the fucking bullet just, yeah, falls out of the barrel.  How fucking crazy.  And it's the anxiety all night long.  Is the gun going to go off?  I can't get the gun to work.  Where's my ammo?  Where's my gun?  You know how happy you are to find a gun?  Oh, my God, they're outside the house.  Where's my gun?  Where's my ammo? 
[02:32:30]  You're so happy to find one in the dream.  You're like, fuck, a gun.  All right, I've got ammo.  And then you open up the fucking cylinder or a revolver.  And you put the bullets in and they fall right through the fucking cylinder.  That's job dreams.  Yeah.  I had the DJ Nightmare dreams where back in the day when I was spinning tunes, I couldn't find the next record.  At AF, I got those all the time.  And the song was ending.  And I didn't know what I was playing next.  And then the anxiety of like, holy crap, I don't have another song.  You would get the song on just in time.  I mean, it was just this anxiety building up over and over. 
[02:33:00]  It sucks.  When we got laid.  I think every person has job dreams, whatever the job you have.  When we got, I was going to say laid off.  When we were fired for two years, I had so many radio dreams that we had gotten a job in radio.  But it was weird.  It was always in a cave.  Like the fucking studio was a cave and like ozone was there and the equipment was like all fucked up and it never worked right.  And I was like, oh, we're going to lose this gig like in a day. 
[02:33:30]  And the whole dream would be just trying to get this piece of shit radio station in the cave on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you don't get it on the air by the end of your dream.  That's exactly it.  What about the recurring dreams?  Now, a lot of people have recurring dreams.  This is my belief.  They're not recurring.  What do you mean?  They just seem like they're recurring when you're dreaming.  Holy shit.  That's fucked up.  That's my.  So part of the dream is that it's a recurring dream, but it's not.  But that's my new concept.  I don't think we have recurring dreams.  I think you think it's a recurring dream, but it's not. 
[02:34:00]  And how could you prove that you actually dreamed of that before?  You can't.  What is that?  I kind of do remember.  Bombs don't normally tick anymore.  Oh, it's a fire alarm?  It's why.  Can we leave?  What is that?  You're a hum.  It sounds like.  A dildo.  Oh, is there a fire in the building again?  Eh, whatever.  Please disregard the idiot downstairs.  Yeah.  That fucking. 
[02:34:30]  I love old pedophile head.  I don't want to say who he is.  Just disgusted all the time.  One of the employees in the building, he's obsessed with just watching us.  And I just want you to know, if you're listening, you have a fucking head like a pederast.  I can't.  I laugh at his ugly fucking body and face every time I see that fun blocking bag of shit.  Your fucking life is almost over.  How does that feel?  He has dreams he can't find his little broom that he uses for his stupid dust pan. 
[02:35:00]  He has dreams he fucking, that he walks into a grammar school and his dick is bigger and  he can't find his lollipops.  Those are his nightmares.  You fucking scumbag.  I hate him.  I wish we would walk in one day and go, guys, I have cancer of the teeth, eyes, asshole,  and nose.  I would go, yippee-ki-yay.  He would actually, I would have to be taken to the hospital for ankle replacements when they  broke when I clicked my heels.  This boy has broken heels. 
[02:35:30]  Fix my heels, man.  Are you making Fight Club references today?  Did you do a Fight Club reference?  Yes, that was a barely one.  When he loses his luggage because it was humming or buzzing.  Oh, okay.  He goes, you know, thought it was a bomb.  He goes, no, bombs don't normally tick these days.  If luggage is buzzing, it's normally a vibrator.  A vibrator.  Let's say hi to Benji in Jersey.  Benji.  You can't say your dildo.  You have to say the dildo.  I'm kind of like, I'm kind of like both of Anthony and Opie because I love the fucking 
[02:36:00]  nightmares, but I also love being uncomfortable.  But I have nightmares about dogs attacking me, and normally it's not a problem, but I woke  up to my girlfriend fucking screaming because I'm punching her in the face.  Oh, shit.  That's rough.  And she had a nightmare that she let the supper get cold.  That's real shit, though.  People that beat up their spouses while they're dreaming.  Yeah.  That's a real, real problem. 
[02:36:30]  Stroke of luck.  She used to be in an abusive relationship, so I try to be sensitive about that kind of  Oh, shit.  But you beat her up in your sleep.  Yeah.  Well, I have anxiety issues, and I'm bipolar, and normally she's okay with me being a fucking  psychopath, but that's one thing.  She started making me take Xanax and shit like that, and I don't really have those dreams.  I got a sister.  She's, I don't talk about her much.  She lives in Florida.  She's older.  Sarah on Florida Street.  She's barely five foot tall, and we're all petrified of her because she sleepwalks, 
[02:37:00]  and will sneak up behind you and scare the living shit out of you, and what scares us  is the fact that she swears she doesn't sleepwalk, and we tell her, and she doesn't believe anybody.  And you'll be hanging out.  Like, when I go down there and visit, we'll be hanging out in the kitchen just having a  good time.  It's like 11, 12 at night.  She went to bed early.  The next thing you know, she comes running full speed into the kitchen with some noise, 
[02:37:30]  and it's like you're seeing a fucking ghost, and then she runs back to bed, runs back to  bed, and she swears that she doesn't do this, and that we're just pulling her leg.  It's gotten to the point when I used to visit them down in Florida, I would put up all sorts  of, like, what's the word I'm looking for?  Like, barriers and stuff, because I was scared to fall asleep.  And she's only five foot.  Yeah.  Because then I'm starting to think, well, even a five-foot person could get the job done  with a knife or something, and if she doesn't remember fucking sleepwalking, she's not going 
[02:38:00]  to remember stabbing me with the steak knife.  Wake up.  Oh, what did I do?  And if I was lucky enough to sleep in a bedroom when I was visiting, I would always put something  in front of the door, so I would hear it coming.  I was scared shitless to fall asleep in our house.  She was one of those people, and she'd do crazy stuff when you sleepwalk, and she swears  she doesn't sleepwalk.  Odd.  I'm distracted, because behind you, just what you just said about this Hurricane Ike, they're 
[02:38:30]  showing the potential pattern, what it needs to do to hit New Orleans.  To hit New Orleans.  I know.  They have a bunch of tracks, and they got the one, like, look, it's still a possibility.  There's one here.  You know it's not.  I hope it hits Houston this time.  Houston.  And knocks down big buildings.  Planet Houston.  Maybe I shouldn't say that.  That's really not nice.  There's a mortgage bail.  What's that place?  Fannie.  Fannie Mae.  Is the government bailing them out?  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, the government is taking them over, really.  Fannie Mae and the other one.  Freddie Mac.  Freddie Mac.  Freddie Mac.  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are being bailed out by the government.  Are these people that would cost us, the taxpayers, about 10 bill?  Now, are these people that will take people's homes?  I don't know how that works.  It's a mortgage company.  Yeah, mortgage company.  And they threw out the friggin' bosses, and the government is taking it over.  And, yeah, it's a bailout.  I just deleted that email from my BlackBerry.  I had all the info for you, Jimmy. 
[02:39:30]  I just don't know how that works.  I don't want to get annoyed if they say, well, if they don't bail it out, more people lose  their homes, and I feel like a dick.  I don't know.  There was a reason, and I wish I had the freaking...  I just read the email quickly when I was walking over here.  It just amazes me how we're so selective as to what we have money for.  It's fucking just annoying how much money we waste and how much money we bail certain  people out but not other people.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee more than half of all U.S. mortgages.  Oh, gosh.  They kind of had to bail that out.  It's one of those deals where if the government doesn't step in, this is a major fucking economic 
[02:40:00]  problem.  What are these fucking...  What's happening with everybody?  The economy just blows.  The economy took a shit.  People, when things were good, especially at the tail end when things were good, people  were buying way beyond their means.  They were being told, yeah, you could afford this, especially with interest rates.  A lot of people got these, what do they call the fluctuating interest rates? 
[02:40:30]  I had one for 10% of my mortgage, and it's fluctuating.  It's called something else.  Bouncy, bouncy.  It was called Bouncy.  It's called the Bouncy, Bouncy Mortgage.  The Bouncy, Bouncy Mortgage.  Where's Rich Voss?  He knows mortgages.  It's a balloon mortgage.  Variable rate.  Hey, how do you turn the economy around?  Oh, that's easy.  Comedy clubs.  You look behind you.  You turn the wheel.  I have no idea, and that's-  Can we just have, can we have something just, which is called Buy Something Day? 
[02:41:00]  What?  Oh, man.  I hear-  I almost don't want to eat my food.  Almost.  Isn't it true you could turn the economy around if you just go out and buy stuff as a mess?  I don't think that works.  It's some weird balancing act, the whole economy.  It's based on a lot of things that all have to be in sync for the economy to be really good. 
[02:41:30]  What if we just had Buy Something Day?  Would that help the economy?  Mmm.  Like, instead of the stupid Jerry Lewis telethon or something, it's a whole day dedicated to  everyone just buying something.  Or if people misinterpret it and they thought it was B.I. something, so all the guys know  I sucked a dick, I'm like, I did this and the economy's still not fixed?  It sucks.  Oh, God, nerds.  Let's see how to Wayno in Ashland.  Good morning, boys.  Wayno from that dumb bar there.  Oh, yeah.  Green Acres, right?  Good evening. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Green Acres, my friend.  Opie, I wanted to ask you about your sister.  Does she also sleep in a sleeping bag?  He's Rich Voss, and will be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston this weekend?  Oh, is Mikey going to be at the Wilbur Theater?  I don't know.  My Wilbur Theater is sold out, so.  Nice.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Chuck in South Carolina.  Chuck.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How y'all doing?  Hey, Chuck.  Better now, Chuck.  Well, I was going to tell you about my bad dream, man.  When I first started out of the truck, I pulled in this truck stop one night just tired 
[02:42:30]  as hell, man, and crawled back in the sleeper.  And I had this terrible dream that I just, I got so tired that I just crawled in the  sleeper while the truck was going down the road.  And when I woke up, man, I was slipping out.  I tore the curtain down and drove on the steering wheel and looked next to me, man, and there's  this truck driver throwing his table work out, just laughing his ass off.  You thought you were moving.  I've had dreams where I've been in the back seat of the car going down the street, and 
[02:43:00]  I'm like, oh, my God, I'm supposed to be driving.  And the whole anxiety is the car is going straight, but you have to get in that front  seat immediately.  Yeah, yeah, because at some point, it's going to be a problem.  And somehow you can't, because you've got a seatbelt on, and your foot's caught on something.  Yeah, I'm trying to crawl over the seat, and it's an older car where there's like a  bench seat in the front.  Right.  And then there's another dream I have where I'm taking off in a 747.  I'm a passenger.  But for some reason, I can see the pilot.  And it's not even on a runway.  It's like through the woods.  And he can't get enough speed, and I can tell, and when it starts going up, it's like 
[02:43:30]  whoo, and starts coming down and crashing.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Is that a sick dream?  Dude, I had one.  We took off from JFK or something, but it was off a pier.  Oh, fuck.  And we went straight up in the air, and then just lost power, and it fell backwards into  the water.  And you absolutely know what that feels like.  Yeah.  You're like, oh, my God.  And you're horrified in the dream, right?  No, no, the most scary part was I was in coach.  I always wake up before the plane crashes.  That was the nightmare of it. 
[02:44:00]  No, here's the nightmare.  I'm on a plane, right?  No, we take off fine, but the guy goes, dude, big fan, and it's an eight-hour flight.  You guys actually, like, you're still dreaming for the crash?  I always wake up before the crash.  Always.  No, I've been there for the crash.  I always wake up before the gun goes off.  Pretty sick.  It's a big cartwheeling fucking 747 crash.  You're in the middle of that in your dream.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's a wreck.  I had a dream.  I wrote a movie, actually, recently, and I had a dream that it actually got picked up, 
[02:44:30]  and then they read the script and changed their mind.  Really?  That's sad.  I'm trying to sell a movie.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  It's embarrassing.  It's about a guy who opens a store which has, like, many, many flavored spreads for bagels  and things, and the movie is called Marmalade Alley.  What the fuck? 
[02:45:00]  I got, like, an hour's sleep on this thing.  Marmalade Alley.  I can't wait to see the Photoshop for the movie poster.  I just thought of that.  Oh, it's a terrible name for a film.  What a great idea, though.  Marmalade Alley.  Let's see how to Kevin in Houston. 
[02:45:30]  Kevin.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, Kevin, with Ike kind of on its way, are they starting to scare the shit out of you  in Houston yet?  Oh, yeah.  We're already in battle mode.  It's coming to get us because we took in all the New Orleans people during Katrina.  That would be hilarious.  Well, you get them back.  Then everyone from Houston goes to New Orleans and takes over for a while.  Yeah, they like it here too much.  We're too nice to them.  All right.  I don't want to leave.  What do you got, Kevin?  I've got a recurring dream.  My wife is a district attorney for Harris County, and she would tell me about a murder 
[02:46:00]  trial that she was trying that week.  And I went to sleep that night and woke up in the middle of the night, I guess, having  a nightmare and slash sleepwalking and confessed to the murder and swore up and down.  It was actually me that did it.  And the person that she was trying that next day didn't do it, but it was actually me.  So that was very awkward and uncomfortable.  Yeah, when you wake up and realize you're not in a lot of trouble, that rocks. 
[02:46:30]  That's the greatest feeling ever.  Part's out, guys.  How are you doing?  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Hey, good morning, ladies.  Yeah, that was called an adjustable rate mortgage.  Yes, adjustable rate mortgage.  Yeah, so I'm going back a little bit.  Also, right after 9-11, George Bush stood on that rubble, and besides, he wanted dead  or alive things.  He told us to go out and shop.  You know, stimulate the economy.  Go buy things.  That's his friggin' answer every time. 
[02:47:00]  So, I mean, the economy blows right now.  So if we all just went out and bought something, do you think it could help in like one day?  If you have a national go-out and shop day?  And when does that?  Yeah, it would help the corporations once again, and we all go out and buy stupid shit  that we don't need.  Yeah, but then the people that own those shops that you bought the stuff from, aren't they  a little better than they?  They hire another person.  You know what?  I got an idea.  Instead of bailing out, Penny May, bail me out.  I'm fucking hurting right now.  I'm not listening to you rich guys talk about it over there anyway, Anthony. 
[02:47:30]  Oof.  A lot of people.  I'm sorry.  You might get hurt by the tax raise, but 90% of them.  I was broke until I was in my 30s.  Go fuck your mother.  Jesus.  Exactly.  And Anthony, if we...  Hold on, sir.  You still here?  I told you to go fuck your mother.  Bing, bing, bing.  I wouldn't have great radio if we shot you 10 years ago.  Hmm.  What?  So maybe those scales will add up to something, you know...  I have no idea what he just said. 
[02:48:00]  I've been in 10 years.  When they're 40s from...  What?  Something about him being a scale.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I don't know.  Listen, I love you, and how was your day with those two old people?  All right.  Let's go to Ryan in Boston.  Ryan.  He's babbling about me.  I don't know.  He's scaring me.  Hey.  Sometimes I have lucid dreams where I can control, you know, what I'm doing.  Like a good example would be, you know, like, oh, I can drive my bike off this cliff just  to see what happens.  So, you know, like, oh, there's a girl.  Yeah, you know you're dreaming.  Yeah, yeah.  Anytime I know I'm dreaming, I grab a girl. 
[02:48:30]  That's a fine balance.  You can control a little bit, but then, you know.  Dude, it's the weirdest fucking thing, because I've been in that situation.  I've said it before.  I go, oh, my God, I'm dreaming.  Holy shit.  And I know I'm dreaming.  And I grab the nearest girl, rip her clothes off, and just start fucking the shit out of  her.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You know you're in the clear, so don't worry about it.  You could do it.  Well, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I've just seen an MTV political controversy that  the host, Russell Brand, really wants to vote for Obama, and he slammed Bush and Palin. 
[02:49:00]  Very rare to hear an entertainer slamming Bush.  Yeah.  That's some edgy stuff on MTV.  We never got to it, but this is what Russell Brand said.  But now MSNBC and the rest of the news channels are picking up on it.  Could I please ask of you, people of America, to please elect Barack Obama, please, on behalf  of the world?  The world, huh?  Some people, some people, I think they're called racists, say America is not ready for 
[02:49:30]  a black president.  But I know America to be a forward-thinking country, right, because otherwise, you know,  would you have let that retarded cowboy fella be president for eight years?  We were very impressed.  It was nice of you to let him have a go, because in England, George Bush wouldn't be trusted  with a pair of scissors.  Very sweet of you.  Really?  How about the fucking, how about your country, which has followed 30 fucking inches behind  the U.S. and done everything we've done? 
[02:50:00]  How about that?  Yeah, and I'm sorry, but Tony Blair was Bush's lapdog for how many fucking years?  Amazing.  That's why I don't go to England, by the way.  And that's the reason, because I think most, I don't know any American comedians that are  successful over there that don't, like, just shit on the U.S.  Like, yeah, our president sucks, or oh, yeah, we're dumb.  Oh, you gotta do that, right.  I won't do that.  Of course not.  Even though Bush is a boob, I'm not saying I even disagree with him.  It's just so typical.  It's like, come on, man.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That guy annoyed me. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And look, again, I'm not defending Bush.  I want to see Obama.  Obama?  No.  You guys ever hear about this dream culture?  What is this?  What?  We know everything on this show.  We're a little bit of, we know a little bit about everything.  We've heard about, ah, whatever.  John, what do you got?  It's an annoy dream culture.  I have no freaking idea how to spell it.  I think it's South and Central America, but these people live out their dreams after  they have them. 
[02:51:00]  So you're whacking off, and you're coming, and all those, and that'd be some good time  dreams living out.  That's such bullshit, because when you go down there with the greatest dream ever that you  supposedly had.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to need a bunch of lesbians to start off with.  Yeah.  Oh, it was an orgy.  It was an orgy.  Just me as the guy.  I need a straw hat, a bowling ball, a log of shit, and four prostitutes.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I was like, that's why that shit ain't going to work.  No one's going to be honest with their dreams.  That's right.  And I need some marmalade. 
[02:51:30]  Marmalade, Alec.  Preferably orange.  That's right.  Orange and marmalade.  All right.  You guys are going to have fun with that one.  Thank you, John.  I appreciate it.  We did the arm thing.  What else?  Craig in Oregon.  Craig?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  I'm just getting sick and tired to listen to people talk about how, you know, they're only  going to tax the rich.  Like, we don't buy all of our stuff from these people.  And they're just going to soak up the extra taxes and not pass it on down.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  It's, you know, when companies get overtaxed, they just raise the fucking price of their  shit.  What do you think they're going to do?  Well, we're screwed now.  Well, they raise the price of the shit and make it impossible for fucking, you know, American  people to afford anything.  What does it take for us to be in a recession?  Because, you know, you do a little talking out there.  Times are tough for people.  What's going on?  It's all bullshit.  It could get worse than this.  Just everyone's got to get up in front of people and say everything's fine. 
[02:52:30]  Politicians, the fucking Fed.  They all got to just get there and go, wow, things are going great.  And then all of a sudden the market will take off.  If it was that easy, why didn't they just do that?  I don't know, because some idiot will always say, oh, it's horrible, because he shorted  all the stock.  Doug in Arkansas.  Doug.  Yeah, they just had National Go Out and Shop Day.  They gave everybody $1,200, $1,300 rebate checks, and it didn't do anything.  I didn't get a check. 
[02:53:00]  Well, that's because you're a fancy man.  I love hearing it in the accent.  Fancy man.  Fancy man.  Thank you, Doug.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Again.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Stryker.  Talking about dreams, here's a good one for you.  At least once, sometimes twice a week, for every month, for probably the last six years,  I have a dream that my wife, myself, and my ex-fiance have a threesome. 
[02:53:30]  And each time, I end up making little cumzies that I wake up into the next morning.  And the worst part is, the two of them hate each other.  Every time they meet, it turns into a cat fight.  And they've met each other like four or five times, but yet I have this dream once or twice  a week.  I don't think that dream's coming true for you there, Pally.  Yeah.  I don't either, but...  I go with the whole recurring dream thing.  Are we really having recurring dreams?  I'm thinking you might have just had that dream once, my friend.  I know I've had recurring dreams. 
[02:54:00]  Great theory.  I approve it.  But, uh, because I remember as a, like, I remember waking up as even a kid and, uh, having  this, had the same dream.  What dream was it?  Um, uh, usually it's the same location.  Someone said I love you?  Because I think as you're dreaming, you'd say to yourself, oh, I've had this dream before. 
[02:54:30]  That's like some Matrix shit.  I'm telling you, man.  I don't, I don't really know if we actually have recurring dreams.  But what was it?  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Oh, it was just some kind of, like, dream I had in a house.  And I know that, like, the location's always the same.  It's always the same, like, thing.  Two bad guys trying to get in the house.  And I'm trying to shut the door.  Like, it happens a lot.  Same dream or similar dreams?  Well, similar dreams, same location.  Kind of ends the same way.  I always wind up running out the back door and trying to run and jump over hedges. 
[02:55:00]  And you can't run or climb.  And, like, I'm trying to run and you got no energy in your legs.  And then you wind up crawling.  You're like, I gotta get away.  Why can't I run?  That's the dumbest thing in dreams.  Your legs are, like, fucking lead.  Like, what is that about?  Mike, Virginia.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I just want to reiterate, I'm not from Virginia, but I'm originally from Buffalo.  I'll make this real quick.  And, Opie, I'm about the same age as you.  And we used to smoke pot and watch that stupid show of yours. 
[02:55:30]  What show?  I didn't call you a tool bag, but you're a lot better now.  What show?  The Rochester News Channel, when you used to do the shit you got on your website.  Nah, because I wasn't on enough for you to really even make the connection.  I was on a few days.  Eh, whatever.  I had, uh...  Hi, Uncle Paul.  That's lying.  That's lying.  Yeah, you're still doing drugs, I hope.  I have a problem with sleepwalking.  And, uh, just before we had our atrocity, I mean, just before we had our baby... 
[02:56:00]  I had a heavy drinking problem.  And so I would piss in random places in the corner of the room.  And my mother-in-law was staying in the baby's bed.  Not the baby's bed.  I'm a dummy.  The baby's room that we were going to put the crib in.  And I had a dream that the baby was choking to death and couldn't breathe.  So I walked in, and I used to sleep naked, and I had to piss.  So I stood over the bed, and I was getting ready to piss. 
[02:56:30]  And my mother-in-law wakes up, and she's like,  Michael, what are you doing?  I was like, oh, okay, sorry.  I just went back to bed.  And my wife informed me in the morning of what I had done.  So, that's my story.  Ah.  Let's get a car.  He pulls it out in the end with a good snore.  He knew the wheels came off early.  Oh, he certainly did.  He saved his ass, though.  Carl Jersey, what's up? 
[02:57:00]  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Carl.  Let me practice this by saying I'm 6'2 and 3+, right?  300+, so I'm a big dude.  Every year around Halloween, I have a dream that these little bunnies, white bunnies,  come in my bedroom window and plant pumpkin seeds in Petri dishes so that the pumpkin  seeds will grow.  And I end up wrestling in the vines because they take over the room, and I never, like,  wake up and find out what happens.  It's probably a fear of having children. 
[02:57:30]  The bunnies.  That's how they test for babies.  When the rabbit dies, planting seeds, a Petri dish.  You're probably afraid of having kids.  Ooh.  Good one, Jimmy.  I was ready to move on from dreams, but Melanie's dream freaks me out.  Melanie and Yonkers.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Better now, Mel.  Good.  Listen to this one.  I used to have this dream that I would wake up, and I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or  not.  I would wake up, and this really ugly man was just staring in my face, and I would close 
[02:58:00]  my eyes, and he would go away.  Now, if you had that dream, could you imagine having to open your eyes every morning?  Yeah.  Just waiting to see somebody there hovering over you?  Oh, the anxiety you must feel.  It didn't happen all the time, but there were rumors that my building was haunted, so I never  knew if it was like a ghost or if I was dreaming.  Speaking of ghosts, my brother swears that the house he's living in now is haunted, and  a ladder tipped over and knocked him on the fucking head. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, God.  Really?  And there was no one in the house.  He's freaked out.  I've got to get Brett on the phone, the owner of FH Riley's.  He swears.  He's had a couple really weird things happen as he's redoing this old house.  Opie, you said your sister sleepwalks?  Yeah, yeah.  Um, my ex-boyfriend took too much Ambien, got into his car and drove while he was asleep,  flipped over a median.  Ambien's a motherfucker, man. 
[02:59:00]  They took him to the hospital, and he actually walked out of the hospital and, like, down to  a pay phone to call his dad while he was still asleep.  Nobody stopped him or anything.  Well, he probably wasn't technically asleep for all that time.  He was probably in some Ambien, and he was high.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, boys.  Love you.  Thank you.  Somebody within the past, you know, couple of months took Ambien to go to sleep and woke  up and decided to start cooking in the middle of the night and melted the pot onto the stove. 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  You?  No, no, no.  Somebody I might have known for the summer.  Wow.  But that Ambien would be, like, just fucking sleepwalking time.  So what happened?  Was the fire just, was it just burning?  Not burning, but when did you guys put out the pot?  I didn't realize the obsession with fire.  The fire, it was, no, the next morning, it was just kind of melted. 
[03:00:00]  The teapot was, like, melted to the burner.  Wow.  Wow, short and stomping my ass, huh?  Let's say, hi, that bird, there's a girl in Arizona.  A bird?  What up, bird?  Yeah.  So I have this.  I don't like that bird.  That bird stole my credit card.  We got another reference.  Yo, what up, bird?  What up, bird?  I have this dream where, like, I walk into this badge, like, a really huge, like, wrinkly  badge, and then I piss all over myself and wake up. 
[03:00:30]  What's your dream, that you're a good egg?  You walk into a vagina.  Yeah.  Really weird.  Nice.  Now we're getting somewhere with these dreams.  We got the girls calling in.  We got Jessica.  Jessica.  Hey.  Hey.  I keep having this dream recently that I'm 20 now.  I just, I'm back in my old high school, and my best friend from high school is there,  and we just start having sex in the middle of my French room. 
[03:01:00]  Girl?  Girlfriend?  Well, what do you mean by just, you can't just say having sex.  I mean, like, what, you know, give us a little detail.  Like, how does it play out?  We start making out, and I go down on her.  I'm a lesbian.  She's not.  Oh.  And you lick her snatch?  I do.  And then I wake up every single time, and I've kicked my pants off, and my shirt's kind  of above my head, and then my mom has to wake me up, and it's very...  Are you a lesbian in real life or in the dream?  I'm a lesbian in real life.  Okay.  She's not, though.  Lipstick lesbian, or you got the mullet? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  No, I'm lipstick.  All right, cool.  No, I'm a lipstick.  How about that?  You just told the worst lesbian sex dream ever, by the way.  I know.  I'm sorry.  That's how real lesbians are.  You girls call up with this stuff.  You got to understand, we're going to get horned up quickly, so you got to get better detail.  Get right to the parent.  The problem is, my friend's not attractive, so really, it wouldn't be that great.  I like that.  I've had so many dreams years ago.  Like, right when you get out of high school, you have dreams that you're still in school. 
[03:02:00]  You're walking around the hallways.  Oh, I'm late.  Yeah.  Late for class.  I was just sleeping for a while where I don't sleep very often, and suddenly my body would  just start to fall asleep.  So, like, I couldn't breathe, and suddenly I would just snap awake, freaking out.  It was fun.  I had a nightmare that I was, all of a sudden I woke up up and the police were there. 
[03:02:30]  And they said, hi, we're the police.  That's what they'd say.  Hi, we're the police.  Oh, footer, what happened to you?  I was going to go to you next.  He has cuckold dreams.  And he has an update.  All right, thank you.  Cuckold dreams.  Yeah, let's say hi to Cro-Mag, the trucker.  Cro-Mag.  What's up, guys?  I want to say, what's up to all our fine truckers out there on the roads? 
[03:03:00]  I got this recurring dream that I have whenever I decide to sleep.  Nude.  Is that these little midget troll fucking things are trying to rip the blankets off just so  they can point and laugh at my dick.  And some nights it gets to the point where I'm jumping out of bed and punching the floor  trying to get them.  Oh, trying to get them.  You didn't end that, really.  You know, sounded like there was more there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to take a break.  Kept dream journal in college. 
[03:03:30]  I dreamt I was partying with you guys.  Opie kicked us out to have threesome with Ellen.  What the fuck?  Ellen Hood the Generous?  What the fuck, Brian?  Brian.  Yes.  Brian!  Hey.  I had a dream here a while back.  I was at a party.  Ended up in New York City with Jimmy and Ant and the rest of the guys there.  All of a sudden, Opie stands up, kicked everybody out of the party.  Y'all got to leave.  Because Opie wanted to have a party, or I mean, a threesome with Ellen DeGeneres and Martha Stewart. 
[03:04:00]  What?  What?  Now he's listening to himself.  Because it was so good.  Yeah.  It was so good that he had to listen to it.  It reminds me of a dream I had, where I was at a Halloween party.  I was dressed like Ellen DeGeneres.  Mm-hmm.  And Opie fucked.  Jesus.  Here's the computer model.  See, they still have one. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, there's one that hooks around.  They have one that kind of comes a little closer, but.  Who's a good curveball pitcher?  Bob Apodaca.  Or I could even go into like a Phil Necro joke or Joe Necro fucking knuckleball joke.  They have one computer model if, if it, if it, ah, forget it.  I'm bailing.  I'm bailing.  It didn't make sense if you saw the tracking, though.  The one was completely out of control and it's not going to hit.  It's not going to happen that way. 
[03:05:00]  It's not going to hit New Orleans.  All right, we're going to take a quick break, get into some other things in just a bit.  Stay there.  It's pretty intense stuff, man.  If you do it, you will talk to intelligent beings from other dimensions for real.  I want to thank Dr. Steve for the crap he sent over.  Oh, Jesus.  Got a perishable box in studio.  We opened it up for some goodness and it was nothing but a lot of dry stuff. 
[03:05:30]  Dry fucking scones and.  Well, I had a, um, I had a cinnamon swirl thing, uh, and then my favorite moment of  the week, by the way, so far.  Yes, of course I had a cinnamon swirl cause they're pretty tasty.  So I'm eating it and I'm realizing like, it's not very flavorful for a cinnamon roll and it's  a little dry.  And, uh, even Travis said there's no frosting on that thing. 
[03:06:00]  He goes, I like no icing.  It's all dry.  It must suck.  I was like, yeah.  And then everyone started talking about how Dr. Steve's stuff sucks.  And, uh, well, I reached into the box for a scone and found a nice big packet of icing  that I was supposed to put on me after I had completed the entire dry cinnamon roll.  I couldn't be happier.  Oh, Jimmy started cracking up.  If you just, I couldn't have been happier if you just opened the frosting and when I 
[03:06:30]  can't believe they didn't give a bun for this.  Does anybody want the second half of this?  This is delicious.  This is Danny's probably one half of it.  It's really fucking good.  Oh.  Um.  Let's get it.  No.  I'm having a dry scone.  It's good, man.  It's too dry for me to eat.  Why don't you put some fucking frosting on there?  It sounds really dry.  Oh my God.  What is that?  It's like killing me.  It's a fucking scone rock?  Scone dust.  What kind of scone is that?  It's like a fucking hardened anthill. 
[03:07:00]  It's a fucking mud hut.  A termite mound.  Dr. Steve sent a chocolate-filled hornet's nest.  I love Dr. Steve.  If it's not a dick pill, it's a fucking hard, frosting-less snack.  Dr. Steve's a creep.  Frosting is very bad for you.  I've removed all frosting.  He hates frosting, this man.  Dr. Steve's house must be really unfun to live in.  Would you like some jelly-less toast? 
[03:07:30]  That must make Ted the frosting producer real angry.  It makes me very angry.  See?  Frosting's for everyone.  That's my motto.  I heard your mother passed away with cancer.  Would you care for a dish of frosting?  Frosting makes everybody feel better.  Where's Hopi going?  Is he going to the bathroom to produce some chocolate frosting? 
[03:08:00]  Or some yellow frosting?  Oh, goddamn.  We were talking about stupid Ted all weekend.  Yeah.  Just came up.  And now Danny one day just realized,  how come all of your characters' names are Ted?  And then we couldn't stop doing it.  It's fun, isn't it?  We were imitating Jimmy all weekend.  And then also,  we couldn't get away from, 
[03:08:30]  this beer drank pretty good.  We were doing that all fucking weekend long.  No?  Cool?  Like no matter what the topic was?  Oh, the topic didn't matter.  What do you want?  Well, does steak eat pretty good?  Hey, what kind of steaks do you got?  It got so fucking annoying.  Yeah.  And we couldn't stop doing it.  My big party weekend, 
[03:09:00]  which wasn't really a party weekend.  More is just people hanging out weekend.  A get-together.  Yeah.  Danny was there, of course.  And Marissa.  And then black guests would just drop by.  My brother came by, Joe Curry.  But during the whole time,  there was one constant.  All of us were just sitting at a table.  And Danny brought this up.  He goes,  Do you realize we've been sitting here  for days just drinking?  Like, there's no, 
[03:09:30]  there's no,  oh, let's go like watch a movie  or, you know,  let's just go inside  for a different,  like a change of pace  or atmosphere.  It was just 72 hours  of just drinking.  Just hanging out and drinking  with various people  that would drop by.  And it was like,  you know,  all we really said to each other was,  Do you need another beer?  And then,  there it is.  Another,  another run to the cabana  for more beer.  Travis showed up. 
[03:10:00]  That was nice.  And then the big hit,  the big wait,  the big get  for the big blast  Oh, yeah.  was when Derek  actually showed up.  Wow.  And Derek was like,  he was billed as like  the funny guy.  He had to be there.  When we heard he was showing up,  we were like very psyched.  At one point,  we were so psyched,  we thought he was bullshitting us  and decided to play sound effects  of a highway behind him  when he said he was on the LIE.  He's like,  where are you?  I'm on the LIE.  I'll be there in a little while. 
[03:10:30]  I bet he's home  with a sound effects machine  because he's the fun guy.  That's something he would do, though.  Derek?  Yeah.  Who, what?  If he's the fun guy,  where?  At a wake?  Where is he the fun guy?  Exactly.  I didn't understand that.  You guys don't hang out with Derek  like we hang out with Derek.  Yeah,  that's what I realized.  There's like a thing going on around here  that we're not really privy to  and I'm a little upset about  because I consider myself like,  you know,  one of the guys.  Kind of.  No?  I don't fit in? 
[03:11:00]  No,  I was just waiting for you to finish.  Where's he going with this?  And then like they,  they have all these,  I don't know,  little,  little,  little secrets  and funny gags  about people and stuff  and I don't,  I'm not privy to them.  But I was,  you know,  over the weekend.  Because you'd have,  well,  because you'd have to like  hang around for a while  after the show.  Oh,  is that what it takes?  Then,  then how do you know  any of them?  Because I'm teasing,  of course.  I meant to E-Rock.  If nicknames were given out  between 11 and 1102  on the way to the elevator, 
[03:11:30]  I'd know all of them.  I have no idea.  I don't want to get out of here.  I'm trying to create  a sardine flavored frosting  for boys and girls  that like such flavors.  Where's Gregory?  He took off.  I think he had to take a dump.  And then I had a great time  installing a Parallels  on my Mac  so I could run Windows off of it.  And that took,  and thank God, 
[03:12:00]  I'm very experienced  with computers,  not so I could get it done quickly,  but so I knew  it would take 10 hours to do.  Anything you try to do  will take you 10 hours  to figure out  how the fuck to do it.  I kept getting error messages.  And then once I loaded up,  it was just so I could  put PalTalk on  because my other laptop  was being used.  And then I just wound up  getting annoyed  at PalTalk.  So it took 10 hours  for me to hook up my machine  so it could piss me off.  Let me tell you something. 
[03:12:30]  Parallels sucks a weenie.  Get VMware.  That loads Windows up beautifully.  I'm not saying it's perfect,  but it is...  Does it?  It runs during,  while Mac is running.  While your Mac,  and you can go  in between the screens.  No!  Dude, I'm fucking around  in Windows.  Where's Jimmy?  Now he's on the Mac side.  I thought Jimmy  was on the Mac side.  No, he's back in Windows.  I go back and forth.  Fucking great, man.  I was getting pissed off,  so I'm going to have to do that.  VM?  Yeah, VMware. 
[03:13:00]  You can get it  from the Apple store,  I think I bought it.  Oh, I might go down there today.  Really?  Whoa!  Oh!  Fun trip for everyone.  Yeah, it's like a toy store.  Yes, what time  are you going  to the Apple store?  Apple store.  Steve hasn't made  an appearance  in here all day.  We were joking  about how he comes in here  and he cannot escape  being goofed on  if he's in here  for a second.  It's like,  the second he steps in here  he's being goofed on 
[03:13:30]  until he leaves.  Well, it's just silliness.  Can Steve come in  at least?  Yes!  I'm very busy.  I know, I enunciate.  I was looking  for a dry scone.  Where is Steve?  Here he is.  Did you have any  of Dr. Steve's good stuff?  Steve.  It's against my diet.  No, it's...  You don't like Dr. Steve?  I love Dr. Steve.  He's a very nice guy.  Yes, he is.  It's just,  it's a lot of bready stuff.  What's wrong with bread? 
[03:14:00]  Breads get stuck  in the little gastric pouch  and I vomit.  All crazy strong testers.  Yeah, no kidding.  Give it out.  We don't want that stuff.  But that,  hey, Travis,  did you enjoy...  I gave Travis...  Well, I was going  to put my fist  through this sticky bun  and Travis insisted  I didn't, so...  Yeah, Travis is,  I think,  one who wants to grab  the sticky bun  and the frosting.  No, you know what it is?  He's just like,  the idea of putting  his fist into sticky buns  is just so...  Boo, Jim.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Steve, why can't you 
[03:14:30]  just get that thing  disconnected?  Like the gastric thing.  Isn't there...  Don't you like train  yourself after a while  like what you can  and can't eat  based on like  your gastro...  And then can't they  take it out  and like you still  just eat like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can,  but then why bother?  Because then I've got to  go through two  really expensive  operations.  You know,  so why bother?  I'd rather just deal  with the not eating sweets,  which I can't do,  and not eating huge portions 
[03:15:00]  of bread products,  which I can't do.  Yes.  And, uh...  No sticky buns.  Oh, you can't eat them  or you can't not eat them?  You're saying like  I have to avoid...  You almost sound like  you're saying  you can't avoid eating them.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know what you're saying.  Sweets.  Bad...  All right, sweets,  because of the way  my body's been reconfigured  after this thing,  if I eat something  that's really dense sugar,  I'll just...  I'll react horribly to it.  Oh, okay.  I'll start beating women.  If only that were the catalyst, 
[03:15:30]  but it's not...  I start...  I get hookers  and kill them.  No, that's a completely  pharmaceutical catalyst.  This is actually  just a sweaty thing.  Wait, what was that?  Goddamn.  I hear that.  Your clothes.  Your clothes.  Clothes.  I know Derek had a hand in that.  Your clothes.  Clothes.  Fucker handing in dry tracks.  I wear clothes often. 
[03:16:00]  What did I miss?  Anything fun?  Nah, we were just bullshitting.  We talked a little about snacks.  We talked a little about  Ant's barbecue.  We had a special guest  stop in for a few minutes.  Who?  Derek.  What?  Derek came by.  And Steve came in.  Yeah.  Steve went to the barbecue?  No.  No.  Steve came in.  I just realized that  the milk was bad yesterday.  What happened?  Did you vomit  or did you shit?  What milk? 
[03:16:30]  I decided to make omelets  with milk that had the  expiration date.  What was that, too?  It was about August 29th, 30th.  I thought it was.  What are you doing?  But I smelled it  and I tasted it.  It tasted like milk.  I fucking hate milk.  But it tasted like milk.  So I made some omelets yesterday  and now I'm dying.  So you were making chocolate frosting.  Oh, fuck, dude.  Yes, he was.  Ted knew.  Extremely uncomfortable  in the bathroom.  Gregory's tummy's acting up. 
[03:17:00]  You need some strawberry frosting  to help your stomach.  I can't even think of food.  I can't have strawberry frosting.  I can't even think of food.  I'm Ted the executive producer.  I enunciate everything perfectly.  Perfectly clean.  That wasn't very perfect.  Ted's just a really bad ball buster.  Yeah.  I'm an executive producer.  I'm a faggot.  Ted doesn't get it.  What is that jar of?  This, my friend,  is apple butter. 
[03:17:30]  Was that in the box?  Was it apple butter?  Apple butter.  I could have put it on my scone.  You could have put fucking anything  on that rough scone you had.  Frosting apple butter.  Would you have sand on it?  It's like a fucking moon rock.  It's like I'm eating over here.  Surprisingly resembles  a loose bowel movement.  Yeah, it does.  I just made some apple butter.  It's my joke.  If you run out,  I got it in the air.  Apple butter's some good shit.  That's for the English muffin.  We got some late arrivers today, man.  Let's see.  Also, the bleachers are filling up.  Not filling up, but... 
[03:18:00]  A couple.  A very sexy girl.  And fucking some sort of a guy  with huge glasses.  And we have two other guys.  Who's that John Miller with the glasses?  Glasses.  You're the only one with glasses, sir.  Oh, they're good.  No, they're with a mic.  How are you, guys?  We didn't see you come in.  You're supposed to say hi to us  before you sit down.  No, leave your glasses.  I'm not fucking with you.  I'm just...  No.  If you don't like my glasses,  man, they're gone.  I like them, actually.  Can we...  All right, they're back on.  Can I see your glasses?  Whatever you say. 
[03:18:30]  I think I've seen him on Pal Talk,  haven't I?  Absolutely, sure.  You've seen me everywhere.  What?  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Are you crazy?  Out of my mind.  Who are you, sir?  Frank.  I'm interning for Ron and Fez.  Oh!  An intern.  Yeah.  So, let me tell you one thing.  Go for it.  No, you're trying much too hard.  To be what?  The quirky guy?  I'm pretty nervous.  Are you?  Is he trying to be like the nutty,  unpredictable guy?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  So, is this your first day  as an intern on the Ron and Fez show?  Yeah, first day.  Holy fuck.  That's going to be rough, man.  He ends every set.  It's the same.  It trails off.  Oh, God.  Pretty much.  Pretty much, man.  What are you hoping to do  with this internship?  Man, just get experience  and maybe turn this into  a paying job somehow.  Pay the bills.  Good luck.  See?  Pay the bills.  How old a man are you, Frank?  What?  How old a man are you?  21.  21.  21.  Have you had any radio experience 
[03:19:30]  or no?  Uh, just college radio.  You know, crappy college radio station.  That's it.  It trails off.  So, you're, uh,  intern of Ron and Fez.  Did they tell you  what your duties would be?  Uh, no.  Not yet.  Just, you know,  cold screening, that kind of thing.  Oh, you got to work yourself up  to cold screening.  Okay.  I'm intern.  Yeah.  You're pretty much, um,  coffee guy.  That's right.  You know, go clean this up guy.  And Fez is semen drainer.  Yes.  He does ask for, uh.  Fez has huge balls  and they're painfully full.  He doesn't even want you  to suck his dick. 
[03:20:00]  You just have to jerk him off  casually without making eye contact.  Fez is a hard case.  Under the console.  Yeah.  So, no one else sees it.  Oh, he's working.  Oh, this is going to be  better than I expected.  No ball gag?  Are you kidding me?  Okay.  Where are you from?  Long Island, Huntington Station.  Really?  Yeah.  Born and raised?  That's it.  Born and raised there.  That's it.  Because you got kind of  a weird accent.  Yeah.  It's almost like a Wigger accent.  It's called Idiot.  You think Wigger?  I didn't catch it.  All right.  I caught a little like this thing. 
[03:20:30]  Is there?  Kind of.  Which Huntington Station  is kind of a, you know,  suburban urban area.  Yeah.  It's a little, you know.  If there's a murder  that's taking place in Huntington,  it's going to have  a Huntington Station after.  Pretty much.  But, no, I thought you were  from some faraway land  because you kind of  talk weird a little.  You got like this weird  thing going on.  Yeah, I guess so.  I'm pretty nervous.  Sounds like Taylor Hicks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has a little Jack Black  in him, too.  Anyone hear Jack Black  out there?  A little Jack Black. 
[03:21:00]  Hmm.  All right.  Well, good luck.  I mean, I'll need it.  Congrats.  And I am definitely  going to listen  because I can't wait  to hear what your nickname  will be.  They give them all nicknames.  They give them all nicknames.  Ronnie's really good  at doling out the nicknames.  Wait, so Franklin's  a nickname?  Hello, Franklin.  No, that's not the nickname.  That's all right.  It's an only bit of goody.  They didn't want to copy Earl's,  so they're still working on it.  Someone's saying  to replace Lazy with Dumb. 
[03:21:30]  Someone's saying  you need a little  Mitch Hedberg, too,  in there.  Oh, yeah, a little bit, right?  Are you a fan of Mitch Hedberg?  No, actually.  No.  I don't like...  No.  You don't like what?  Brilliant comedy?  I don't like his...  You don't like brilliant comedy?  No, I don't like his stand-up.  You don't like brilliant comedy?  That wasn't me, by the way.  Oh, okay.  I was hiding my face  behind the mic  and I hope he was talking  to who you can't see right now,  so, you know,  you thought it was me.  That's right.  You're looking at me.  I was talking to you. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Who's the couple?  Yeah, we got a couple there.  Hand that mic over.  Good luck.  Have fun.  I kind of want to talk to him some more.  Oh, we're not going to...  All right.  Hi, who are you?  Hi, I'm Jackie.  Jackie?  Where are you from?  From Philly.  I knew it.  When you said Jackie.  Is that your boyfriend?  What's going on?  Yeah.  What brings you guys up?  His birthday's tomorrow, so...  This is a hell of a birthday gift.  Yeah.  Seeing Opie and Anthony on a Monday. 
[03:22:30]  Woo!  Yeah.  The Monday bleacher crowd is really amazing.  God, wow.  How old the boy is he?  He's going to be 29.  Wow, what's he want?  What's that?  What's he want for his birthday?  Why would that mic work?  Why can't we figure out the mic?  Seriously.  It's on.  Just...  You interview your boyfriend there.  Okay.  What?  No, your mic doesn't work, sir.  You guys have to share a mic.  Is it on?  It's on.  It's on.  Well, great.  It's on.  Guess what?  It's not fucking on!  What's up? 
[03:23:00]  That's the whole point.  There you go.  Now I can hear you.  Now it's on.  Steve, what was the matter?  It was broke-t-key-can.  Apparently, we're not smashing it hard enough when we turn it on.  Was it on?  Yes, it was.  Okay.  So the girl, what does your boyfriend want for his birthday?  Nothing.  He doesn't like birthdays, so...  It makes you feel older, right?  If you're offered up the fart box, he'd enjoy his birthday.  Yeah, well, I'm only 23, so he's going to be 29, so...  Obi raises a good point. 
[03:23:30]  Obi said that if you offered up the fart box, it would be a good birthday.  He would be into birthdays again.  Just like he was eight years old getting that first bike.  Yeah.  How old are you?  23.  Oh, see, and you're 29?  It's fucking disgusting.  I know.  Fucking sick.  Only six years?  Yeah.  Jesus, only...  How long have you been together?  Like eight months.  That's it?  Mm-hmm.  Wow. 
[03:24:00]  So you just hooked up, or did you have boyfriends and girlfriends before?  Nope.  We met at a bar.  All right.  Hey, you know, are you a birthday dude?  Are you a fan of Anthony?  What?  A fan of the whole show.  All right.  But if you, like, if you wanted to take after Anthony, do you see that girl sitting to  your left, she would have to be two years old.  Wow.  Did a little math there, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just did a little subtraction.  Oh, Uncle Paul, stop being so nasty. 
[03:24:30]  I love when Anthony announces the people's names.  It's got to be.  It's my favorite thing.  Literal Joe.  Oh, I love that.  I love that.  Fucking Keith Oberman got his.  Yes, Puffy McSprote from Wack Bag.  Fucking douche.  Completely off topic.  Not really, Puffy.  MSNBC shit-caned Oberman from anchoring political shows until after the election, I believe.  Good.  Be a good boy and sit on the sidelines, asshole.  Goodbye.  You're embarrassing the network.  What's the story?  Could you get that for me, Danny? 
[03:25:00]  How fucking great is that?  He's embarrassing the network.  Ha, they gave me all heave-ho.  He's such a prima donna cunt.  All that brown nose and got him nowhere.  He's such a fucking prima donna.  He does nothing but douche.  Other on-air talent, I could not be fucking happier.  Good.  That's right.  If they shot him, I'd be much happier.  That's right.  Here it is.  Right in the face with a cum gun.  It doesn't say buzz-buzz that many times. 
[03:25:30]  Why do they remove Keith Olbermann?  Can we have that guy read this?  So he trails off after every sentence.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey.  The New York Times reports tonight that Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann will no longer  anchor during upcoming political news events as network insiders reveal more about what's  been happening.  I guess there's been all sorts of shit going on behind the scenes at MSNBC.  Good.  And someone said a few weeks ago that the whole network was going to blow up. 
[03:26:00]  After months of accusations of political bias and simmering animosity between MSNBC and  its parent network, NBC, the channel decided over the weekend that the NBC News correspondent  and MSNBC host David Gregory would anchor news coverage of the coming debates at election  night.  Mr. Olbermann and Mr. Matthews will remain as analysts during the coverage.  Oh, see?  Nice.  The change which comes in the homestretch of the long election cycle is a direct result  of tensions associated with the channel's perceived shift to the political left, my friend. 
[03:26:30]  Ah.  Yep.  Good.  That's what you get, fuckhead.  What is that noise out there?  Wow.  That's odd.  Good.  I'm so glad it happened to him.  Fantastic sound.  And there's more.  Fucking asshole.  In interviews, 10 current and former staff members said that long simmering tensions between  MSNBC and NBC reached a boiling point during the conventions.  MSNBC is behaving like a heroin addict, one senior staff member observed.  They're living from fix to fix and swearing they'll go into rehab the next week.  What?  I don't know what that means. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, my God.  I like it.  Horrible analogy.  There you go.  I hate MSNBC.  They dump diamonds.  Fucking Olbermann throws all of his co-workers under the bus, whether it's David Schuster or  fucking I.  He stinks.  And he just sandbagged Morning Joe because he was telling nicely about McCain.  Get the shovel out, you fucking asshole.  One guy can't speak highly about a conservative on your dog shit network.  Why do they have to have an agenda?  Why can't they just do it? 
[03:27:30]  Because they're not real fucking news people.  Yeah, they can't do it without throwing in their own fucking opinions.  What's the news channel that's closest to unbiased, in the middle, moderate?  I don't know, man.  It's really.  Because that's the type of TV I need to watch.  You can find bias anywhere.  CNN makes me puke how much they're into Obama.  And Fox makes me puke how much they're into McCain.  It's ridiculous.  And where does MSNBC fall in that?  Way left.  Way left.  So they're Obama?  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  More than CNN?  I'm not kidding. 
[03:28:00]  I honestly don't know on that comparison.  I'm only looking at the way they're hit.  Look at the groveling apology Olbermann gave Hillary.  I mean, it's just embarrassing.  It's sickening.  You flipped from CNN to Fox.  You can't believe they're watching the same event.  Well, they're not news.  They shouldn't be given the umbrella of news to hide under with content freedom  because they really are biased, entertainment-based shows.  The days of journalism that is unbiased is over.  It does not exist.  Not when you have to make it entertaining. 
[03:28:30]  That's what they have to do now to get people to tune in.  These guys actually think their personalities should be big and important.  I'm so fucking happy they yanked that asshole off the desk.  God, he must be fuming.  Oh, yeah.  Big fucking-headed creep didn't want to be assassinated.  You fucking dickhead.  Shut up.  He's the joke of the network now.  He really is.  Where they laugh at him when he walks in.  Hey, he's the guy that got fucking fired.  He fucking- 
[03:29:00]  He's just-  He lapses boss's asses.  Well, I was all for yanking Imus, but I didn't want to say it until-  Really?  Pitbull?  Yeah.  Sounds like you're playing it safe there, shithead.  And those same bosses that he went to fucking complaining about Imus  now told him,  Take a walk.  We don't want you covering this.  Yep.  That's funny.  I'm so happy.  I got to give a Brilliant Instant Feedback Award out today.  Brilliant.  Do we have a sound effect or anything?  Brilliant Instant Feedback Award goes out to Kyle S. from Indiana. 
[03:29:30]  Right.  Goddamn rich cunt.  No.  He writes-  Wait, no, the brilliant sound, it's got to be a sound of brilliance.  Hmm.  You dumb asshole.  Kyle S. from Indiana writes,  I decidulously hate Keith Oberman.  Wow.  The word is assiduously.  He writes decid-  No, it isn't.  Assiduous?  Or disid-  Assiduous.  With an A.  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know now. 
[03:30:00]  I know, but I don't.  Look up decidulously.  His work has been assiduous.  Well, Oberman-  With Steve, he'll know it.  The point is, Oberman likes to use the big words like that.  Yes, he does.  To show how smart he is.  That's right.  Well, smart guy.  The quarterbacker is using his own big words against him.  That, my friends, is brilliance.  Thank you.  I'm so fucking glad they did that.  Mm-hmm.  I'd love to know what's his spin-off.  Wait, was that made it this morning, that announcement? 
[03:30:30]  Or over the weekend.  What was his response?  I don't know.  I don't know, Jimmy.  Let's see what the pit bull has to say.  Let's see what always angry tough guy has to say about his network.  Oh, let's see.  I've got to drop that ticket off.  What's the matter, my love?  You did get a ticket?  No, no, I didn't get a ticket at the parking thing, because now I've got to exchange the  cars.  So somebody's got to run down and take this ticket down and have them exchange my Escalade  now for the Ferrari. 
[03:31:00]  Could you take a ticket and exchange my Escalade for the Ferrari?  Where's a useless scrub of an intern or something I can have this handed to?  Comes Hip Hop Ron.  Hip Hop Ron.  Who's not very hip hop at all.  I want to see if you could translate this to Mr. Security out there.  Sure.  Master Po.  That's right.  This ticket is to go to the garage.  He will take it down there. 
[03:31:30]  Why don't you have shoelaces in Ron?  Immediately.  Yeah, no shoelaces.  Why aren't you wearing shoelaces?  You can't afford shoelaces.  What's the matter?  It's not the hip hop way, my friends.  Is it?  No, I had shoelaces in them, but they were kind of tight, so I just took them out.  And now you're walking around with no shoelaces.  Well, the tongue of the sneaker is connected to the shoe inside, so I don't really need  shoelaces.  Yeah, that's the latest trend.  You got the Converse?  Converse is doing that.  Why are you always doing that now, too?  Wearing Jordans without shoelaces.  It's the new trend, Jimmy.  They sew it together.  Look at Jimmy, he's just like, I don't get it. 
[03:32:00]  It's the big thing.  But he's not really into hip hop.  All the kids are wearing that.  Shoeless sneakers is in, right?  Who's he?  Joe Jackson?  I say to you that your work here has been assiduous.  Hey, Ron, you're singing the Britney Spears song since the VMAs I'm hearing?  Yeah, me and Sam have been singing in the office.  Wow.  Let's hear you do a little Britney Spears for everybody.  I hear you're a funny dude, but you clam out when you're on our show.  But behind the scenes, they say you're hilarious.  That's true.  But I only know the, you got a piece of me. 
[03:32:30]  Well, let's hear it.  Yeah, let's hear it.  I'm sure you were singing it better than that.  No, I just go, you got a piece of, you want a piece of me.  And Sam comes in with the rest of the chorus.  Oh, where's Sam?  Where's Sam?  Need to hear that.  Yellow.  Sam, here it comes.  He's lying.  Not only was he singing that song, but he's been singing the new Pussycat Doll song.  All he does in the office at the CBS side is sing pop songs while I'm trying to get my work done.  Sam sings along with me. 
[03:33:00]  We like a little duet that Sam joins in.  Ron also makes stuff up all the time.  What's the Pussycat song there?  Hip-hop?  When I Grow Up song.  All right.  How's it go?  When I Grow Up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  That's not how he sings it.  Come on.  You got to sing it.  People always talk the words.  Tell it out, Ron.  When you tell them to sing something.  Come on, Ron.  Sing it.  Sing it.  When I Grow Up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  No, you're not doing it right.  You're talking it.  You're talking it.  He's got one of the greatest New York accents, by the way. 
[03:33:30]  This hip-hop.  He does.  He sounds like Danny Aiello.  You're not going to be able to work in radio anywhere else except New York.  Or you should take a lesson from Steve.  You got to pronounce it.  I would think clothes.  Yes.  Shed your regionalism.  Clothes.  Clothes.  By the way, very good news.  Eastside Dave is not going to be fired.  He was on the fence for a couple days.  And Eastside Dave is going to skate, my friends.  Really?  Is he getting suspended or in trouble?  He got fucking suspended, which is complete bullshit.  And I let Washington know just that. 
[03:34:00]  Do we need to help Dave at all?  Is he okay financially?  Oh, no.  He's not okay financially.  We should help him for the week, Dad.  He is a broke man.  We should make sure he's taking care of it.  He needs money for the baby.  Buy him some diapers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dave, I have $7 with your name all over the...  That's nice.  ...seven crispy ones.  Send your contributions.  I don't know why he got suspended.  He knows how to do radio the way we're looking for.  And he did it perfectly.  And got people to talk, and that's our whole jobs with this dumb thing.  And then he gets suspended for it. 
[03:34:30]  Bullshit.  But he didn't get fired, thank God.  All right.  You want to do Peace and Me like this?  Oh, Pussycat Dolls?  You want to sing along to the Pussycat Dolls hip-hop?  Sure, I'm not.  All right.  Here we go.  Close.  When I grow up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  Drive nice cars.  I want to have groupies.  All right.  Hold on.  What's wrong with you?  I only don't like the hooks in the song.  I only don't like the one line.  But that was still part of the hook.  I only know the first one. 
[03:35:00]  It's a long hook.  I'm not familiar with the entire song.  Just that part of it.  Why don't you blow your nose?  Yeah, start over.  Do you breathe through your nose or no?  No, I think when I was young, I used to fall on my face a lot.  So I fucked my nose up.  Jesus.  It sounds like you're going to fall on your face.  That's right.  He's got the worst nose.  Poor boy had armed paralysis.  I'll settle it in two seconds.  Back on flash.  Oh, you're still dealing with that?  I'm sorry, man.  So wait, you really have bad congestion?  A little bit.  Not really.  It's just my voice is terrible.  Okay.  It's not good. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  He usually sings Pussycat Dolls way higher, though, like a girl.  All right.  Yeah.  No, I've never done that.  All right.  Let's try it again from the top.  Here we go.  Pussycat Dolls starring Hip Hop Ronnie.  Fuck it, Sam.  I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  Travis, I don't know the words.  You have a crew.  Wait a minute.  Do we have the words for him, at least?  Why would we have the words?  I was just going to say that.  Why would we at this point?  But then again, it's kind of hard to just all of a sudden have the words for the fucking 
[03:36:00]  Pussycat Dolls.  Yeah.  You sound a little like Hepburn when you sing, I want to grow up.  I like how he says star.  Yeah, I want to be a star.  All right.  Let's try it again.  Do I have the lyrics?  When I grow up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  When I grow up, I want to be, drive nice cars.  I want to have groupies.  When I grow up, I want to be famous when I grow up. 
[03:36:30]  Careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.  Just might get it.  Just might get it.  What you wish for, because you just might get it.  Just might get it.  I don't know the words, so I'm afraid.  All right, we got the words for you.  Oh, gee, of course. 
[03:37:00]  Thanks, Chase.  And I want to, you know, you got to get your voice up there a little bit.  All right.  Sure.  All right, here we go.  Hip-hop rock.  When I grow up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  I want to see the world, drive nice cars.  I want to have groupies.  Be on TV.  People know me.  Be on magazines.  Fresh and clean.  Number one chick, when I step out on the scene.  What you wish for, because you just might get it. 
[03:37:30]  But you just might get it.  But you just might get it.  What you wish for, because you just might get it.  But you just might get it.  You just might get it.  Just tell me I was silly.  Until I popped up on the TV.  I always wanted to be a superstar.  And when the singing songs would get me this far. 
[03:38:00]  You're complaining.  We all want to be famous.  So go ahead and say what you want to say.  Be nameless.  What was your name is.  Because see, when I was younger, I would say.  When I grow up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  I want to be in the world, drive nice cars.  I want to have groupies.  Be on TV.  People know me.  Be on magazines.  Fresh and clean.  Number one chick, when I step out on the screen. 
[03:38:30]  Because you just might get it.  Just might get it.  Just might get it.  Just might get it.  Just might get it.  Just might get it.  I'm a trendsetter.  This is true.  It's what I do.  I work into it better.  You can talk about me.  Because I'm a hot topic.  I see you watching me, watching me. 
[03:39:00]  And I know you want it.  I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  I want to be fair.  Drive nice cars.  I want to have groupies.  When you're on TV.  When I step out on the scene.  Because you're just might get it.  Just might get it.  I can't look at anybody.  Just might get it.  Oh boy. 
[03:39:30]  Just might get it.  Hip Hop Ronnie, everyone.  Yeah.  Can I leave now?  And Sam helps you out with these songs.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I usually know the one line.  And then Sam knows all the rest of the lyrics.  What part do you do, Sam?  No, I like to know what's big with today's kids.  Because Hip Hop Ron comes in with a new pop song every day.  Yeah.  So he just kind of helps to tell me what's cool.  What's your favorite pop song right now, Hip Hop?  Well, the last song I told him was the Lil Wayne song.  But he hasn't listened to it yet.  What, the lollipop thing?  No, Let It Rock with Kevin Rudolph.  Oh, fuck.  I don't think I know that one. 
[03:40:00]  He did say, Ron told me that the David Archuleta song came out.  And Ron said it was actually pretty good.  He was digging it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard it once.  It was pretty good.  Do you like Rihanna?  No.  Disturbia?  It's not bad.  Disturbia is all the rage right now.  Here, a little thing on Pal Talk.  Hey, Ant, would you mind reaching over and decapitating him?  When I grow up, I want to be a star.  I want to be on the lake and see the loons with Norm.  I just love how he says star. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, I want to be a star.  Ah, Footer, what's up?  There's no business like a full merman.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, check it out.  Remember we spoke a little bit about the cuckold situation I was getting into a little bit?  I'm not the cuckold.  I'm doing the banging.  Yeah.  All right, check this out.  I got the weird...  Anthony, you had said a little bit of weird situations, maybe like the guy bugging out  in the middle.  I hear them when we even talk about your fucking song.  It's fine with me. 
[03:41:00]  That's right.  The sickest one that happened so far was he said something about being a true voyeur.  So I go by there, and first he walks in, he puts a little video on of his wife.  Now, this dude was such a creep, bro.  He had it set up where he tells me that his wife, you know, has a few glasses of wine  and takes an Ambien or something, a sleeping pill before she goes to bed.  Her fantasy is she likes to wake up in the morning, and he'll tell her stories about  a little, you know, how about a dirty whore she was.  So I'm sitting there like...  Basically, he wants you to rape his wife. 
[03:41:30]  Exactly.  So I'm like, the more he's telling me, I'm thinking, I'm like, oh, fuck this.  I'm not blowing a load anywhere near this place.  You know what I mean?  Next thing is evidence.  Guaranteed.  So I'm like, fuck.  Let me just, you know, feel the situation out.  Dude, pitch black in the bedroom.  He has this little handheld, like, little light, like a little mag flashlight, and he'll pop  it on, and he actually has, like, a fucking triangle, almost like a bell, and he hits  it, turns the light on real quick at her, and, like, he tests her to see if she hears 
[03:42:00]  it, and she's awake.  Like, he's a fucking creep.  I had to end up bouncing out of there.  Basically, he just wanted you to fucking, like, stand over his wife and beat her up  on her.  Yeah, he probably drugs her, man.  That's fucking creepy.  Nice.  Exactly, dude.  It had to be something.  So, like I said, for the record on the air, 202, I did nothing.  That's fucking a guy who's, like, really...  He's probably just wants to look at your dick over his wife's face.  He's got some hatred for his wife.  He probably spikes her thing or gives her more ambience.  That's fucking creepy, dude.  Nice.  That really is creepy.  Friend of mine's a cuckold.  He's a fucking huge cuckold. 
[03:42:30]  My friend Ted.  Ted the cuckold.  He really is.  Yeah.  Would you make love to my wife while I sit in the corner and touch my penis?  The bigger, the better, I always say.  Oh, honey, look.  That bull came inside of you.  Cream pie time from Ted.  Lower your vagina on my mouth and squeeze out that frosting that Anthony neglected to eat  on his fucking muffin this morning. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, look.  There's a lot of it in there.  Oh, you fucking idiot.  Is it gay if I'm kissing your pussy and the bull's balls are on my face while he makes love to you?  I'm just a cuckold.  That's right.  The bull's balls.  Oh, there's a black cuck right inside my wife.  I take it all in the mouth.  I've never heard of the word cuckold before, Jimmy.  Jimmy, no.  Yeah. 
[03:43:30]  What makes it funny is the bull's balls.  Actually, they call a black dude who's, hey, Rob Bartlett just texted me.  He's getting out this morning.  Oh.  So I was very happy to hear that.  Good to hear, Rob, on the mend.  All right.  Let's get line of the day done.  We're obviously doing what?  Huh?  What?  I want to get it up.  All right.  Thank you, hip hop, Ronnie.  Good job.  Someone's suggesting we call that segment, what's the pops?  How about what's the craps? 
[03:44:00]  That's what it sings like.  Line of the day sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any  of your files.

[03:44:30]  That was a bounce pass.  Nice.  Nice.  Start the day off with an AIDS joke.  Yeah, it was, what was it, 603?  No, I know.  It was instantly.  Oh, the Gallup polls got McCain ahead now.  Yep.  I think we're going to have a woman vice president.  Yep.  He got the convention bounce, my friend.  He got that convention bounce.  He's just the newest.  He's got a convention bounce.  He's got enthusiastic voters the Democrats take with 61%.  They're very enthusiastic. 
[03:45:00]  Republicans only 42.  No, I think we are going to have a female vice president.  No.  Yeah.  No.  That's what I think.  No.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.

[03:46:00]  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I had a dream.  I wrote a movie actually recently.  I had a dream that it actually got picked up,  and then they read the script and changed their mind.  I don't know.  It's embarrassing.  It's about a guy who opens a store 
[03:46:30]  which has many, many flavored spreads for bagels and things.  And the movie is called Marmalade Alley.  What the...  I got like an hour's sleep list.  Your clothes.  You dumb asshole.  Boring.  I was just guessing.  Sorry.  Oh, damn. 
[03:47:00]  I don't have my bank on this.  That's funny.  I just went for a button like this.  Alright.  Let's get out of here.  Thank you, Bleacher people.  Thank you.  Bleacher creatures!  Give up the fart box for his birthday.  He'll enjoy it.  Yeah.  Hip-hop, ask her if she wants to give up the fart box.  Are you allowed to do it up the fart box?  He already has.  Oh, hey.  A little too much information now. 
[03:47:30]  I know.  I'm obsessed with how hip-hop Ronnie talks now.  Hip-hop.  Hip-hop.  Hip-hop.  Hip-hop.  Hip-hop.  He fell on his nose a lot?  Is that what he's doing?  Yeah, excuse me.  Into his stepfather's fist.  Someone had a great line.  He's like one of those goats that just falls down all the time.  Whenever he gets scared, he just falls and hits his nose.  Those goats are so fucking cute.  Yeah.  They just stop and their legs go straight out.  Little goats.  I want to hug them and then scare them and then eat them. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Pop.  Take us out with a little acapella.  I want to be a star.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  How about a little more?  Acapella.  Acapella.  Start from the beginning.  Let's go.  When I grow up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  When I grow up, I want to see the world.  Drive nice cars.  I want to have groupies.  When I grow up, be on TV.  People know me.  Be on magazines.  When I grow up, fresh and clean. 
[03:48:30]  Fresh and clean.  Number one chick when I step out on the scene.  Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.  You just might get it.  You just might get it.  And I'm out of lyrics.  Oh, my God.  He has the New York accent, man.  Yeah.  That is it right there.  The tire's a pimp.  You talk through your nose and you don't move your mouth much.  Yeah.  I've been told that.  Sounds like Dominic Barber a little bit. 
[03:49:00]  Happy me.  What were the Goldmans on CNN, huh?  What?  Well, yeah.  Oh, they're doing a whole thing on OJ.  No, OJ's trial starts today.  A year later.  Is this the fucking get over it already segment?  Jesus Christ.  Let it go, Fred.  What was it?  95 to get off?  Fuck that.  I hope Fred takes it all the way to the end, my friend.  Well, so do I.  I'd just be obnoxious.  Oh, okay.  Of course.  Look, there's the OJ.  He is mad as shit at OJ. 
[03:49:30]  Oh.  You think?  Jesus Christ.  Bullshit mad.  Yeah.  I bet you OJ wishes he went to jail for the murder.  He'd be out by now.  He'd be getting out.  He would have to deal with Fred Goldman.  And then Fred would be like, all right, well, he did his time.  But instead, he's got to deal with Fred until fucking Fred decides to kill him someday  when Fred Goldman knows his life's done.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  That's going to be the scariest day in OJ's life.  I still think.  When the doctor says, Mr. Goldman, you have cancer.  Yes.  You're going to get a lump in your head.  Yeah.  I still believe that's how it's going to end eventually. 
[03:50:00]  Fred, when Goldman knows he's done.  Yeah.  On this earth, he takes out OJ with him.  Maybe, yeah.  These fucking fainting goats.  Is there anything else?  Oh, where are they?  It's the second time I'm watching it.  They're so cute.  It's on a loop.  Look at this.  Fucking.  They just tip over.  Wait, wait, wait.  Watch this.  They get scared and just fall over.  It's the stupidest thing.  Look at that stupid thing.  And their little tails are floggling.  Look at the fucking...  Towards the end, he opens an umbrella.  He gets like eight of them at once. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  Look at them.  Look at them.  What are you fucking pussies?  Their legs go stiff.  Those goats are stupid.  Faggots.  It's the dumbest thing.  What do they do if a predator's chasing you besides get eaten?  It's the dumbest defense mechanism ever.  Yes.  Collapse and be a meal.  Yeah.  I'll collapse and show you the most vulnerable part of my body.  Here's my belly.  Yeah.  You can rip this open.  Watch this.  And the...  All I would do is fucking scare you. 
[03:51:00]  I wish chicks were like that.  Boom.  And then you fucker.  Oh, then it brings up all the other cute animal videos.  Yes.  The very angry devil cat is pretty funny.  The very angry devil cat?  Yeah, that one's...  What is that?  That one you need...  You just want to punch...  You need sound, but I want to see his face.  You just want to punch this fucking thing.  Well, I never punch...  That's not the original.  This is the original.  Oh.  Oh, you got the original?  All right.  Very angry cat.  Watch this.  This fucking thing, man.  All right.  It's...  Wow, that cat's pissed. 
[03:51:30]  Would you deal with that cat?  What the fuck?  With a gun?  Yeah.  How much to put your dick in that cage?  Oh, shit. 
[03:52:00]  That is fucked up.  Isn't it amazing?  There's something so fucking scary about that.  Even though it's a small cat, you could kill it, but...  Yeah.  That goes back to fucking saber-toothed tiger days, man.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  That is the same species.  I mean, it's a fucking...  You know, it's a cat.  Sure.  Fucking hysterical.  That cat was pissed.  That cat was mad.  I bet you the person with the camera had a dog helmet on.  Or a dog mask.  Dog helmet?  A dog helmet.  What is a dog helmet?  It's a hard helmet with soft ears. 
[03:52:30]  That's all it is.  Your face is the same.  But it's a hard brown helmet with soft, cute white ears.  A dog helmet.  And you're fooling no one.  Holy shit.  A dog helmet.  You don't need the explanation for the fainting goats there, Steve-O.  Well, yeah.  He's saying that they...  Well, it was on Mythbusters.  It's a muscle disorder that locks up their legs when they're excited.  Yeah, and then them fall asleep.  They don't actually pass out.  No, they're just fucking pussies.  These fucking angry animals have got to go.  What is this, Travis? 
[03:53:00]  Why is Travis showing us a dumb dog?  It's a very excited pug.  Yeah.  Is it Travis's pug?  I know he has a bug.  Oh, shit.  I was looking at a giant dog on the...  It runs face first into the TV.  I don't know where a dumb fucking cunt this dog is.  Oh, fuck.  Now it's slow motion.  You gotta do the slow motion.  Yeah.  That's the YouTube video, like, thing you gotta do.  The last one has to be in slow motion.  Yeah.  You get it.  What a dumb dog. 
[03:53:30]  I love how it just runs so fast into the base of the TV.  Not even near the animals.  No.  The speaker system, you fucking retard.  Let go of the thing, fatso.  I know.  Fatso holding a little version of herself.  God, this idiot doesn't know how to make a YouTube video.  You don't do the whole thing in slow motion.  Oh.  Just the action.  Oh, God.  The action.  Now the dog will tear the fucking speaker out, and then he'll be mad at us.  And we'll hit it.  We're babbling. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, I think this is fun talk.  Yes.  The YouTube segment.  Yeah.  So, YouTube segment.  Silly time?  No.  I thought it was silly time.  Yeah, it is.  Let's get the fuck out of here, dog.  We gotta get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go home and jerk off all over ourselves.  Yes.  I gotta make some more apple butter.  Ugh.  Hey, guys.  I got a good joke to close with.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you say we make like a tree and leave?  Boy, did something really vile pop up in my head halfway through that. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I think I know exactly where you were going.  I know you do.  Yeah.  Ooh.  All right.  Let's go with that.  All right.  Let's put this one in the box.  Take it easy.  It's in the box.  See you tomorrow.  Yo, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got ain't pretty good, don't it?  No beer.  Budweiser.  No beer.  No beer.  No beer. 
[03:55:00]  Budweiser.  It was all over beer.  They was up there.  Beer that didn't handle.  Yo, yo, yo.  What's wrong with the beer we got?  Beer.  Budweiser.  Beer ain't pretty good, don't it?  Beer.  Good.  Yo, yo, yo.  What's wrong with the beer we got?  Budweiser.  Beer ain't pretty good, don't it?  Some of our beer. </pre>
