<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics in a chaotic and often vulgar manner.  The show began with Robert Kelly recounting a snuba diving experience, detailing encounters with sea creatures and a shipwreck, all while interspersed with homophobic slurs and sexually suggestive jokes from the hosts and Kelly.  This segued into extended audio clips from the hosts' visit to a Las Vegas adult expo, featuring interviews with a gay porn actor (Mark Sterling), a transgender person (Tanya), and a porn actress (Delilah Strong).  These interviews were heavily punctuated by sexually explicit comments and discussions of the individuals' physical attributes and professions.  The segment also included a discussion of a suicide video and the hosts' reactions to it.

The broadcast then shifted to a retrospective on the hosts' past on-air antics and their feelings about the consequences.  This included a graphic recounting of a listener’s reaction to *Bonnie and Clyde*, followed by a discussion of the emotional toll of their outrageous stunts, contrasting Opie's ability to justify their actions with Anthony's reported remorse.  The discussion detailed a humiliating incident involving a midget attempting a striptease on the show, along with prank calls to funeral homes and an Alzheimer's facility.  A particularly memorable incident involved a "faith healing" bit with "Wheelchair Fred" at a Boston live show, which resulted in Fred falling and a near riot.

Next, the show transitioned into a segment covering seemingly unrelated topics: driving etiquette, Katie Couric's perceived trivial news stories, Adam Corolla's breakup (including speculation about his potential to date men), Tony Danza's post-*Taxi* career, a humorous bit about snipers and Howard Stern, and a caller's opinion on hockey.  The hosts discussed their upcoming Sirius XM show content, including a "filthy" segment and their "walk" to the studios.  A significant portion debated Madonna's controversial photograph and the perceived double standard in criticizing Catholicism versus Islam, followed by a discussion about Barry Bonds and accusations of racism in the context of his home run records.

The "filthy" segment followed, documented by a profanity-laced walk to the Sirius XM studios with Dennis Leary and Lenny Clarke,  featuring interactions with passersby and a homeless man with a severe leg injury.  The "Daily Dump Report" then detailed the show's profanity, leading to further discussion of word appropriateness, and included a recounting of a confrontation Dennis Leary had with a segment producer on the Jay Leno Show.  Leary and Clarke were present in studio during this portion of the show, with discussions around Leary’s weight loss and off-color jokes about sex lives, violence, and child-rearing.  Promotion for Leary's *Rescue Me* was also included.

A segment focused on a drinking game created for *Rescue Me* based on on-screen events, followed by discussions about the show's future seasons and anecdotes involving a hot air balloon landing in Merv Griffin's backyard and a jet fighter dogfight experience.  A phone call with John Mayer followed, discussing his fandom of the show, comparing it to schoolyard bullying, his upcoming tour, his stand-up comedy experiences, his views on critics, musical influences, and the impact of the internet on younger generations.  Listeners called in, including one apologizing for leaving a Counting Crows concert early.

The next segment discussed the changing nature of bands continuing without original members (The Who, Black Sabbath, The Cars being examples), and the extremely loud volume of AC/DC concerts. This was followed by a discussion centered around John Mayer's MySpace page, the comments received, the hosts' experiences with MySpace, and descriptions of photos women often posted, leading to a discussion about dealing with inappropriate fan messages.  This segment also included a bit about a weatherman fired for saying "Martin Luther Coon" on air, which triggered a discussion about the disproportionate scrutiny of Black figures in history and racially charged jokes about Abraham Lincoln, with Patrice O’Neal as a guest. This part also touched on the hosts’ decision to air XM Satellite Radio commercials on their terrestrial radio show while criticizing the competition.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment highlighting the hosts’ outrage over their commercial radio station airing XM Satellite Radio commercials, replaying four-year-old audio clips of their initial reaction and a phone call with their general manager, Ken Stevens, who defended the decision.  The hosts mocked Stevens' reasoning and highlighted their own foresight regarding satellite radio's potential success.  Ben Sparks was mentioned as laughing in the background of some of the older clips. The show ended with the hosts reiterating their belief in their business acumen and preparing to continue their broadcast on Sirius XM.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the worst of a war.  Now this is cool.  This is something unique and different.  Oh, it's a nice change of pace.  Strap on your deuce chill belt.  That just stinks.  There's no substance to it.  Oh, it's just this big, confusing mess of who gives a crap. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, we suck.  Anything else?  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're talking about hurricanes and scuba diving,  and Bob Kelly was very excited to get in on the conversation  and decided to tell us about his snuba.  He did snuba adventure.  What is snuba?  It's a cross between snorkeling and scuba diving. 
[00:01:00]  Faggot!  What is it?  How did they make scuba diving a faggot?  Snorkeling is cooler than snuba.  Really?  Yes.  I really was trying.  I thought you would.  Well, Opie was like, yeah, they get great diving.  And he's like, yeah, I was 20 feet under the water there.  Wow.  What is it?  A big, long snorkel?  My ears hurt.  What is snuba?  Exactly.  I think what it is, they give you just like a fishbowl of air, basically.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, not the big...  They give you a tank.  You get a tank like you. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  Except you don't put it on the back.  All right, maybe it's cooler than I'm thinking that.  They put it on a float up top.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you got a 20-foot cord.  So basically, you wear the belt.  You wear everything except the tank.  Except they don't want you to have the responsibility of having the tank on your back.  Well, you can't go down more than 20 feet.  20 feet under the water is pretty...  A lot of pressure.  It's a lot of pressure.  10 feet's enough.  The monster's under that water.  Monsters.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  Can you see now where it's normally your sundress blow up in your face? 
[00:02:00]  That would be sick.  I went snuggling.  Yeah, did you?  Snuggling.  What's it called?  Snuba.  Sounds like that.  Snuba.  Snuba.  They got to change the name to make it sound cool.  Aren't those pillows?  They sell it there.  You know when you're talking to Ovi during the break and he takes out a pen and a piece  of paper and you're like, ah.  And starts jotting it down.  Fuck me.  Snuba.  They should give that a cooler name, like blowing someone.  I was 20 feet under.  It's a shipwreck. 
[00:02:30]  It's like a big shipwreck.  It's unbelievable.  It's literally like 60 feet long.  It looks like they're Titanic, especially under the water.  The big fish the size of you are coming around.  It's pretty creepy.  Yeah.  And this dumb couple from Cuba, they tap me under 20 feet on there.  I'm trying to join myself.  Look, do them in the sign language.  They give me the camera and I start snapping photos.  I look.  It's a regular disposable camera.  They just took it under the water.  They thought it was these fucking morons.  What do they know, dude?  They probably swam there from their home apartment. 
[00:03:00]  They didn't even know where they were.  They weren't even on the tour.  They just swam in.  They thought you spoke Cuban.  The truck sank and that's when you ended up in the snow.  They didn't know.  I saw a moray eel.  Yeah.  I was in Hawaii for my honeymoon and we were snorkeling.  It was off of Maui, off of the Black Rock right there.  And the guy who was out there with us teaches us, I don't know, he was out there.  I don't know.  And I was snorkeling and fish all around me and something big and cold touched me. 
[00:03:30]  I looked down and it was the largest fucking turtle I've ever seen in my life.  It was bigger than me.  Okay.  And it was all gnarly and had shit growing off of it.  And it was just scared the shit out of me.  Hey, no reason to go under there.  Oh.  Nah.  Dude.  Oh.  No reason to go underwater like that.  What the fuck is under there?  Get the fuck out of me, man.  That's amazing.  Discovery Channel in high definition.  That's all I need, my friend.  This is beautiful.  It's amazing.  Fuck going down there with those monsters.  When you go down about 100 feet or so and you get to like, you know, swivel it's a little. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, his cord doesn't go that far.  100 feet.  Yeah, 100 feet.  100 feet.  Your mic stinks today, Gavin.  100 feet.  I noticed that an hour ago.  I was hoping someone was going to fix it.  Oh, talk into it.  See if it...  Hello, hello, hello.  That's better.  Maybe you have to be right on top of it.  So now I apologize to the people I just slammed.  Make it like you're snooping and put it in your mouth.  Yeah, exactly.  But when you snooping, do they actually give you balls to cup?  I actually did...  The mouthpiece is a cock.  Yeah.  And you hold the balls to your mouth.  And it's actually some Hawaiian instructor holding your head under. 
[00:04:30]  It's in his tub and they fucking throw like little super goldfish and you eat them.  Yeah, a little penis.  No, the food I mean, like the little snack food.  Oh, yeah.  The multicolored goldfish.  I actually did the other one, too, where it's like a little scooter.  Oh, God.  You did a little scooter.  It's a bubble of air over you, like a little submarine.  Yeah.  From your nipples down, it's in the water, like in a scooter.  And you just go...  You can ride around.  It's like a little motorcycle. 
[00:05:00]  And you zoom around the bottom like this little road.  And you follow the fat guy and his wife.  That's pretty wild.  How far down are you?  20 feet.  Oh.  I think 20 feet.  Let me tell you something.  As you're going down, he goes down 100 feet, man.  That's a lot of...  That's a lot of...  Dude, that pressure was killing me at 20.  You've got to know how to equalize, my brother.  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to push it.  Welcome to the world of your feet.  That was very hurtful.  I'm very hurtful, but very precise.  Yeah.  Almost like a surgeon on that one. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  My feet try to blow their nose to release depression.  Wait, let's say hi to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris?  Yeah, I just wanted to let Bob Kelly know that I'm not a historian, but I think the Titanic  was a little bit longer than 60 feet.  Punching out.  The key word would be like, jackass.  I know that.  I exaggerated to get the fucking point across.  You dumb redneck.  And you're like a cunt.  How's that sound? 
[00:06:00]  Dude, it was like the Titanic.  The boat?  No, no, the DVD thing.  It was only a couple feet long.  What's wrong with you, Bob?  He's hungry.  I don't know.  He just made me.  I didn't like his fucking...  He made me mad.  I'm sorry.  Bob, why?  Because you said something about my feet, and I took it out on him.  I went home and kicked the dog, Jim.  I was molested!  Thank you for being here.  You were happier.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  What just popped out there?  What just popped out?  Snooba.  I want to go snooba diving.  Let me ask you a question.  When you go down 100 feet, what kind of fish do you?  You must see sharks and stuff are down there, right? 
[00:06:30]  I've never seen a shark.  I've seen long barracudas and turtles and...  I don't know.  How about a nurse shark?  Do you ever see a nurse shark?  Nurse shark.  Those big worthless sharks.  With the fangs.  They don't really bite you.  But they do nothing.  They can bite you.  They smother the elderly like a good nurse.  They bite a lot of people.  They bite a lot of people, Jim.  Oh, fuck a nurse shark.  I'll put my dick in its mouth and laugh at it.  You got bitten by a nurse shark, put a fucking gun in your mouth.  Yeah, the reason they bite a lot of people is because they're real shallow and people 
[00:07:00]  step on them and they bite you.  Well, yeah, they're reacting like, hey, your foot's on me.  That's why they bite a lot of people.  Great white, you don't have to step on for it to fucking bite you.  It doesn't just lay like a big fat nothing.  Hi, I'm a nurse shark, are you?  I'll pick it up by its cock and throw it.  The craziest, there's no joke here, but when I started scuba diving in Turks and Caicos,  that was about 60 to 70 feet down.  Okay, beginner dives more or less.  And there's a shelf.  Don't tell me. 
[00:07:30]  And the instructor was really cool, so he let us go over the shelf.  Ah, that scares me.  In a semicircle and then back, you know what I'm saying?  So we go out a little bit and it was just complete darkness.  It's fucked up.  And then we get back on the boat and he goes, yeah, where I had you guys out,  it drops pretty much a mile straight down.  That's so fucked up, man.  I'm glad you didn't tell me beforehand.  Giant square will come up and eat you.  I just thought maybe it was another 100 feet or so.  Even that would be, you know, death.  You feel like you're falling, right?  I was sinking into the boat. 
[00:08:00]  No, no, you don't know which way is up.  Because, you know, you're spinning around and stuff.  You fool around with it a little bit.  You have to fall out of bubbles, right?  And you're all equal.  I mean, you're wearing so much belt that...  Well, no, the whites are not.  Look at how the whites are much...  Right.  I could have had you...  But that was like...  That was crazy, yeah.  That's just...  That thought of that is retarded.  And you just look out and all you see is just complete darkness and you're wondering  what's on the other side of that.  I was actually...  The middle of the boat was cracked open. 
[00:08:30]  Apparently, this big, huge vessel was on the...  Exactly.  It was just cracked open.  And you...  I think when you let your air out, you sink, right?  Something like that.  How do you...  When you let your air out, when you breathe out, you'll go down.  I don't know the rules of snoop.  I'm sorry.  Here's the rules of snoop.  When the cock pops out of your mouth, you're done snooping.  Do you wear a weight belt? 
[00:09:00]  No.  I'm not stepping into that fat joke, Anthony.  You're out of your mind.  You think I'm stupid?  I swear to you it wasn't a fat joke.  There's a fucking bomb DeLuise joke coming out.  I wanted to know because...  He's wearing an asteroid belt.  That'll get a cruise ship anchor to...  I was going to ask because I know that the weight belts he used to give you neutral buoyancy  with the tanks on your back.  You wear one.  So you wear one.  You wear one.  It's not like a heavy...  He took my weight belt and kept taking weight out of it.  He basically gave me a belt with no weight. 
[00:09:30]  He wound up having to put swimmies on his arms.  He gave me a Chanel belt.  I was going to say, he gave you a belt with styrofoam on it.  Should have given you a belt of scotch.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah, that was good.  Can I...  You never get a car crash, do you?  Jesus.  You never get a car crash.  They call me Harry Chapin sometimes.  Oh, he bounds immediately.  You saw a barracuda.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw a barracuda when I was snorkeling.  Scary looking.  Man, and they say, oh, they won't bite you, mate. 
[00:10:00]  You know, don't worry about it.  I don't believe it.  It's bullshit.  I was pretty much freaked out by that.  Barracuda, unbelievable.  You on a fucking pirate ship?  I thought he just said that.  Who told you that?  The bird on your shoulder?  Cutsucker.  They won't bite you, mate.  They won't bite you, mate.  I did that for this tea-sipping jackass next to me.  Did they tell you that?  What are you doing?  Take it to the mic.  What are you doing?  Jim Rimshaw?  Jason from Rye on the NSP back.  Oh, what's on the other side?  Ant, monsters.  Monsters.  Yeah.  What about it?  Monsters. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's all that's down there are monsters.  That's what I keep saying.  Dude, there's no monsters.  There's monsters down there.  They don't breathe air.  Right.  You're in their environment where the second you don't have your fucking air with you, you're  dead.  Giant squids.  That shit.  What if there's a king of snuba board?  Snuba.  Yeah, just climb up your snuba board.  I'm telling you.  That's a lifesaver.  When you got that, you can always look up.  I was sinking in the middle of the boat.  Like I said, I had a big crack.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you just start sinking.  And it just goes dark.  What do you do?  Just start jerking the snuba wire? 
[00:11:00]  It goes dark in the boat.  It raises you out of the water.  Look at 20 foot.  You don't go dark.  It doesn't go dark.  Listen to me, dude.  20 feet down.  I was in the boat.  It goes dark.  In the vessel.  I'll be in the vessel.  He's in his bathroom.  He's acting like he's doing deep sea diving with his little big helmets.  Him and Jacques Cousteau just got out of the Steinbeck novel.  It was dark.  You climb down the boat like you're on the floor of the ocean.  Twinsy feet.  You see your eyes, you dummy. 
[00:11:30]  Twinsy feet.  I forgot the second.  Dark.  Stub it, Gaffeson.  Open your eyes.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  You're right.  I did close my eyes.  I was in the boat.  They turned the lights off at the aquarium.  You were in fucking Vegas in the MGM just looking at fish in the hallway.  I'm snubing.  Snubing.  I was in.  Let me explain myself a little better to help you guys out.  Maybe you misunderstood.  Apparently, we went down the wrong track, and it might have been my fault. 
[00:12:00]  I was in.  There's a big boat.  Okay.  A vessel.  A vessel.  A vessel.  And it had a hole in it from one of the explosions.  We were going down there for booty and gold.  Plenty of the blues.  And then, as I sunk into the hole, I like to call it the abyss.  An octopus guy came out?  The abyss.  And it got dark.  David Jones.  It got very dark.  What happened next, old cum beard?  He meant peg leg, and he put the peg right in his asshole. 
[00:12:30]  He got fucked by it.  That's a long job.  Do you have a bumper sticker now that says, I'd rather be snubing?  Wow.  You don't put it on your car.  You put it on your broth bowl.  Your time's over.  Fucking homo.  Wow.  Oh, you're an adventurer.  Oh, my God.  You're a risk taker, man.  Wow.  Did you also go to Seaside Heights on a safari? 
[00:13:00]  Shit.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Fucking snooze, man.  Oh, I had to fucking slap your face.  I can't wait to see the photoshopped.  It was dark down there.  Plenty dark it was.  Amazing.  18 feet.  Arr.  Fucking only went out into fucking a mile fucking foot of water.  No, no.  It was.  I'm in 20 feet.  It was dark.  It was.  I'd reached the end of me, snuba line. 
[00:13:30]  Arr.  Free go to my blog, snuba.com.  Don't need the rest of my story.  Two of us went in the water.  Two of us come back out.  You run the Indianapolis, huh?  I'll never snuba again.  We were floating in the water, cocks all over.  We had to fight theirs to suck them.  It's not like the Robert Chubb.  Cross that one out.  Cross snuba out of your fucking notebook of death.  Oh, snuba.  Fucking goddamn notebook sucks.  I mean, self-esteem's been smashing that fucking notebook. 
[00:14:00]  It's like the fucking, what's that movie with the book?  Snuba equals sucking nuts underwater with balls in ass.  Wow.  Thank you, Jason from Rye.  What would you say, like the movie, like the book?  The notebook?  What's that?  No, no, no, that movie.  It's not an adventure if you can hear him.  The necrum.  It's not an adventure if you can hear him talking on the boulder.  Yeah.  If you look up and you see two guys on the dock, you're not fucking scooping.  You're no dock. 
[00:14:30]  You're out in the middle of the fucking ocean.  Yeah, you are.  Because the middle of the ocean is 20 feet deep.  It's not 20.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  You said 20.  You don't go to, I can only go 20.  You're in a lagoon.  No.  Central Park.  I'm telling you right now.  He's in the deep side of the pool, folks.  That's a half pool, all right?  He's in the pool of the drain.  He's pissing everything.  You guys can't, everybody, you guys can't get him out quick enough.  The only thing.  You're like fucking Barracuda.  I feel like I'm back snoobering again.  Give me that notebook, that Necronomicon, whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:15:00]  Did you just say snoobering?  That's hilarious.  Snoobering R.  Look up, pigeon sheets on him.  I was snoobering.  The only thing that went down was you on the instructor.  I really tried to bond with O.P.  Yeah, snoober.  He went, really?  He went like, excuse me, what did you say?  Snoober?  When I heard you say snoober, I just, like, in my head, I went, oh my God, no. 
[00:15:30]  It's over.  It's over.  I can't ask what it was.  20 feet's not even deep enough to get a Kennedy victim out of the water.  Fucking taking deeper dives than fucking Manhattan clamshotter.  Stinks, you snoober story.  Big fucking deep sea adventure.  Fucking get a friend with a pool and fuck yourself.  It's not an adventure if you can touch the bottom of the pool.  Yeah, you fucking ass. 
[00:16:00]  Jesus Christ.  Stupid North is spitting up fucking almond dust.  Oh, it makes me so happy.  I can't believe this is so great.  I'm going to go snoobering again in a couple of weeks.  That's great.  Have fun.  How long does it take?  You have to get a license to snuggle.  I'm a loser because I'm not certified, so every time I go on vacation, I go through the dumb  courses again.  How long does that take?  I've gone through the courses three or four times.  What do you get your narrow card?  I'm just an idiot. 
[00:16:30]  How long does it take?  Honestly, to get certified on vacation, you can do it in a week.  Yeah.  But I'll do a quick refresher course for like, I don't know, like an afternoon and then  I'm diving again because I tuck my weight.  Do you learn in the water or no?  It's easy, man.  It's the coolest thing I've ever done in my life.  Can you get certified?  It's scary, dude.  I'll tell you what, man.  You can get certified in pools in Manhattan.  Absolutely.  Folks out there, don't ever do that.  Okay?  Get certified before you go in the ocean.  Where do you go, though?  Huh?  Where do you go?  It's easy.  Last year, I went to the Cayman Islands.  Yeah.  And then the water is just crystal clear. 
[00:17:00]  Cayman Islands was awesome because you take a boat out, it's not even a half mile offshore,  and those dives are only 60 or 70 feet, but it's perfect.  That's it.  60, 70.  You run out of cord.  I was 60.  I was 60 feet.  The boat is 60 feet.  You're out.  You said 20, though.  No, you can only go 20.  The cord only allows you to go 20.  They don't want you going any deeper than that.  Oh, so you're floating.  You're floating in 60 feet of water.  Oh, I got you.  Do you understand?  Same thing.  It's deep.  It's off the cord.  I mean, it's really deep. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, but you can only look down.  No, you get to go down 20 feet, so you can literally go sink inside of this wreck.  You can only sink 20 feet.  But it's inside of a vessel.  Is it?  Why don't you do this?  How creepy is it to go 20 feet down, Opie?  Honest to God.  20 feet is nothing.  Like I said.  How creepy is it to go 60 feet down, Opie?  It's not that bad.  How creepy is it to know that there's things around you?  How creepy is it when you know there's monsters in the closet? 
[00:18:00]  How creepy would it be to see you in swim trunks with a bell on your head?  Ding, ding, ding.  You quickly realize when you scuba dive that just about everything in the water scared you.  Not everything.  Just about.  That's the key.  Just about.  Well, everything I saw.  Here comes that one, two percent that isn't.  Dude, a bull shark or a tiger shark is just crazy.  Not even a great white.  A great white doesn't go near warm water.  I saw reef sharks when I was snorkeling.  It was part of the thing we did. 
[00:18:30]  How big is a reef shark?  They look like they're, I don't know, eight feet or so.  A white tip can get up to like 10, 12 feet.  There's some of the Bahamas that you can.  Well, this is the problem with the Bahamas.  You go down there, they don't have rules like America.  Bill Burr and I talked about this.  It's all good.  Everything's all good.  We went snorkeling, they said, you go to three different spots and the third spot you get  to see nurse sharks.  And what they do basically is a part of this area, they have a, like a.  I don't think Jimmy likes the nurse sharks. 
[00:19:00]  They have a, they have like a bait box.  Yeah.  That they leave on the bottom of the ocean, which is honestly 40, 50 feet down, I guess.  So you're snorkeling on the top of the water and you get to see the nurse, the reef sharks  come and feed, you know, from the, the, the feed box or whatever.  But then they start circling up because they're curious.  And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden the instructor's like, all right, everyone out  of the water.  Like, you know, they're taking a chance every time they, they do this, this run.  Yeah.  The sharks probably aren't going to bother you.  And then, and then when we all got on the boat, they start throwing chum and these things  were jumping out of the water and just in a huge feeding frenzy. 
[00:19:30]  And you're thinking, I was just in the water with this crap.  When I was, I was 15, I was in Australia and the family, host family that had us, they  had like an 82 foot yacht and they would take people out there.  There's an island off of, um, off of, uh, Melbourne.  It's two islands.  One's a penguin sanctuary.  Another one's a seal sanctuary.  And there's...  What do they hand you when you go to them?  A bat and a video camera?  No, no.  You can't, you can't even land at them.  There's no place to land.  It's just two rocks. 
[00:20:00]  But the channel in between, it's got the most amazing sharks.  These great whites will breach out of the water to kill a seal.  So you'll just be sitting there and you'll see a bunch of seals and then all of a sudden  one will just take off flying in the air.  They'll just, boom, just be launched out of there.  It makes you real small.  Do you go to the penguin sanctuary?  Wah, wah, wah.  Funk.  Steel toad boots.  Black blood dripping on them.  You go have some laughs.  Use your fucking metal boots, have a laugh.  There's plenty of them. 
[00:20:30]  Max from Fairfield.  Take a golf club.  Max?  Yeah, the water runs only 20 feet, but it displaced to 60 as soon as Bob stepped into it.  That's pretty good, Max.  This guy's using water displacement.  I really did.  In the ocean.  That's ridiculous.  A seal sanctuary and a fucking penguin sanctuary.  I don't know where I'd want to lay a barbed wire first.  Oh, my dick is hard.  Just thinking of all the things I could slap with fat stomachs.  Look at the seal.  Wah, wah. 
[00:21:00]  Whack.  A nice golf club to the belly.  Yeah, I'm not some faggity environmentalist kid.  These seals get thrown up like 20 feet in the air, dude.  It's amazing.  They just, I mean, these like 400 pound seals just fly in.  Just pieces of them just powered by a great way.  Phenomenal.  Love the snoba.  Oh, I'd fucking push them into the water if I saw a shark fin.  Wah, wah, wah.  Fucking boot right to the back of its fucking black head.  Bon voyage.  Oh, yeah.  Beat it.  White stomach. 
[00:21:30]  Phenomenal.  God damn.  Anything else you want to share about?  I know you have that pen and that notebook near you.  Any of the tender moments?  Really?  What the fuck?  I just wanted to be fucking, you know, like snoober buddies, Hopi.  I wanted to be, I want to, hey, you got stories.  I got a knife.  I bought a knife for my ankle in case something would happen.  Hey.  You know, we want to meet snoober buddies.  There's a hole in the wall while you're watching pornographic videos. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I need some air.  And he puts his fucking oxygen hose through and then he shoots some air down your throat.  You chew some gum and go home.  Let's go to Corey in Jersey.  Corey.  Hey, Oaf.  Yeah.  You were saying you can get certified in a pool in Manhattan.  Not true.  Yeah, because you got to do your open water dive, right?  Yeah, but you can do your training.  You can do all your courses and stuff.  Yeah, pulls in Manhattan and just teach you how to be raped by wilding teenagers.  You can do the dives in the islands, though.  Yeah, no, I was mistaken.  You can take all the classes and stuff, but you still have to do like an open water dive. 
[00:22:30]  How much does it cost?  You know, it varies.  Like a fancy guy like Oafy, you know, he could have whatever schedule he wants.  You know, I used to charge, I taught diving for about 12 years.  And, you know, a fancy man like Oaf, I'd charge him a couple grand, and, you know, he's good.  How much do you charge an unfancy fat man that snoopers?  Of course, probably 300, 400 bucks.  That's it?  That's it.  So, two grand for Oaf and 350 for me?  Well, I... 
[00:23:00]  At least you could do it like a man.  Yeah.  Well, you don't...  Hey, sir, are you a professional?  You sure are a professional.  Do you snooping?  Is that...  That's not bad, right?  No, it's...  It's Liberace gay.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it really is.  You're very, very, very...  Now, how much does a tank cost?  Do you have to buy your own tank?  No, you can...  Or is it like barbecuing?  Do you just go and you return that tank and get a brand full one?  Propane.  I'm different.  How much does a suit cost?  And does it come in double X?  Suit.  You don't need a suit.  Get all kinds of suits.  Yeah, they go up to about a double X, and then they stop, because I've tried to get... 
[00:23:30]  I've got to get a vest made for me if I want to go.  I've got a guy that weighed over 400 pounds.  What, did you teach him to stop eating?  I would.  Apparently not.  All right, Corey, thank you.  What did you do?  He was eating fish like sushi, just in the water?  He's chasing squid.  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, Bob, lift up your shirt and show the guys your propeller squad.  Fucking manatee bastard.  Propeller squad. 
[00:24:00]  I like the fucking manatee at the end.  Just in case no one got it.  Yeah, just in case nobody got it.  Even though he did get it.  He threw that in.  He threw the ending in.  That was pretty good, you fucking jackass.  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Serious XM.  Let's get Steve in here.  We've got to talk about this audio you guys got at the porn convention.  Where's Steve?  That might not be good, but you should listen to it first.  No.  Oh, that's the beauty of what we do.  On the fly.  We don't have time to pre-listen to this stuff. 
[00:24:30]  Hi, Steve.  Yeah, Steve, get over there so they can get you on 20-20.  So they can film you for 20 minutes and use none of it.  Long time no see.  Hi, sweetie.  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm lovely.  So you guys went to the porn convention when we were out there in Vegas.  Yeah.  The Adult Expo.  We know better.  You do?  Yeah, because the first year we went, you guys went, we went to the convention.  And it is, for these guys, it's like they're rock stars, all these porn stars.  They know their names.  They know all the companies.  They're so excited. 
[00:25:00]  And to me, it's just stinky horror convention.  It's like girls with ugly fake tits and too much perfume that's obviously covering up a night of action.  And that, to me, not as into it as these two.  These two are running around like it's Disney.  Personally, last year I enjoyed when all the sleazy directors were coming up to my girlfriend  and asking if she ever thought about doing porn.  That was a highlight for me.  I got to tell you.  They were doing it?  Oh, God, I got to tell you. 
[00:25:30]  It was a highlight for me.  I don't know.  They're just in the motion picture business.  In the motion picture business.  That was just wonderful.  They're recruiting.  Yeah, they were.  Lindsay does not get that picture.  That was a treat for everybody involved.  All right.  Well, we learned.  And then there's guys there, and they're completely naked except for a sock or something or some leather band.  They're touching their junk.  They've got their hand on their cock, and then they want to shake your hand.  That's a fine how do you do. 
[00:26:00]  Thank you, no.  What's wrong with that?  There's not enough Purell on the planet to make me go back to that place and shake anyone's hand.  Don't be broads.  They sit down for an interview, and it's like, so what do you do?  Well, I was nominated for Best Anal in a gangbang.  Fantastic.  Where did you go to school?  There's nothing I could ask these women.  The best part for me last year afterwards, we went up to the Venetian to have lunch, and it's inside, but it looks like you're in an outdoor cafe. 
[00:26:30]  And it was a bunch of us having a nice little lunch, and it was all the women that were rejects that were hoping to get discovered at the porn convention, and they weren't getting discovered.  So you had these messes walking around with tiny little outfits, and one girl had like a drill doe, and her boyfriend that was dragging around, because the boyfriend was hoping that she was going to get discovered so they could pay their bills.  And it was so obvious they weren't going to get discovered, and they were walking around all rejected, that no one gave a shit that you were there.  And they're walking through this really, really nice restaurant area while people are trying to eat. 
[00:27:00]  Great.  People trying to eat.  And third-rate whores are walking through.  Yeah, they just did not get discovered at the porn convention.  Not into it.  So this year, you guys walked around as Jim, Steve, and Laszlo?  Yeah, we learned our lesson from last time.  I mean, Ant's right.  You try to interview some of the girls, and all they do is they just start plugging immediately.  They don't really know how to conduct a conversation.  They just start immediately telling you what videos they're in, and it's pretty boring.  So Jimmy, and Laszlo, and myself sort of zeroed in on a couple key areas, parts of the convention floor. 
[00:27:30]  Did you cut this audio up?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's...  Well, I'm so nervous.  No, it's fine.  But I don't want to...  I don't remember it.  Well, it's...  You will.  It's been about three weeks or so.  You guys talked to Mark Sterling.  Who's Mark Sterling?  Mark Sterling is...  I believe he was...  Well, the first thing we did...  He's a gay porn actor.  Yes, he's a gay porn actor.  And he discusses what genre Steve would be best for.  Yeah, this was Jimmy's little treat.  Jimmy brought us all the way into the back corner of the room and decided how many gay guys wanted to bone me. 
[00:28:00]  Something tells me his take on kissing and having sex with other men a little different than what we heard from Oprah and the Brokeback Mountain.  All right, so here's Mark Sterling talking to the boys at the porn convention.  What do you think of him?  Now, a lot of people tell him that he should do adult videos, but he's too shy.  What do you think of him?  Would he make a good living in adult films?  I don't do any casting myself. 
[00:28:30]  If you're doing a reality show, would his face be well-received by your audience?  I think it would sell for an audience, yeah.  Really?  Would the community recognize that look?  Yes.  Good.  In fact, I have a company that would probably sign him right now.  Really?  What company?  Bear Films?  Bearfilms.com.  Bear Films?  B-E-A-R?  Yes.  You have no idea how perfect that is.  Why do you say that?  It's a huge market to Bear Films.  I don't know, like hot sellers, but nobody makes them. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  And you kind of fit a category, in my opinion.  Are you saying he's a bear?  He fits that stereotype, yes.  Okay.  I hate you.  There's this whole thing, I guess, in the gay community, this bear thing.  Yes.  Now, we're talking B-E-A-R.  Yes.  Like a fuzzy bear.  Right.  They're big gentlemen, usually a lot of body hair, and this is a typo, almost a fetish, 
[00:29:30]  I guess, for some gay people.  And for some reason, Steve, our lovely Steve, fits in perfectly.  Apparently.  And these bear lovers love him.  And this asshole couldn't have been happier every time.  You're saying apparently you've got a flaming bear on your t-shirt this morning.  Yeah, that's a little much.  Yeah, exactly.  A flaming bear and stay cozy on your shirt.  I just thought this was a cool design.  I wasn't really good.  What's cool about it?  It's a teddy bear with fire on it.  I'm not even making a joke.  Like, your shirt was crumpled in front, so the stay looked like it said gay. 
[00:30:00]  So it would be gay cozy.  Wow.  Well, now it's not.  Apparently.  You have a flaming bear right on the front of your shirt.  All right.  But it's a fire.  It's a little teddy bear.  Flaming is, you know, you would think flaming.  All right.  I'm not defending myself well right now.  No.  I'm no.  More Mark Sterling talking about Steve, the gay porn actor.  What's the difference between a bear and a cub?  Is there a difference?  There's a very slight difference.  Bear is much more masculine than a cub.  So he's a little more shy, much more submissive than a bear. 
[00:30:30]  So he'd be more of the dominant fellow.  Yeah.  All right.  Lovely.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You have no idea how happy you just made him.  He's going to torment me for a year now.  I'm trying to get a rap doll and stupid before we leave.  I know.  Really?  He's going to tease me for a lot.  Really?  Thank you.  That's a very accurate impression.  Thank you so much, Jimmy.  He doesn't care.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  And that was just the first one.  All right.  Now we get some audio from Tiger.  Who's Tiger?  Tiger? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, Tiger was this guy at another gay booth.  He was wearing leather assless chaps.  And big, you know...  Of course he was.  I don't know.  The chains on the front of his chest, I don't know what they're called, but it was...  Yes, I'll kill you.  I certainly don't.  And Jim wanted to ask him a couple questions.  All right.  Yeah, it discusses what genre Steve would be best for.  Hi, I'm Jim.  Hi, Jim.  How are you doing?  Tiger.  Hi, Tiger.  And this is Steve. 
[00:31:30]  Pleasure to meet you, Steve.  How are you?  Let me ask you a question.  Yes, sir.  I've been taking a poll.  This gentleman, I'm standing here, would he do well in the adult industry?  People tell him that he should get into films and he's too shy.  Do you think he would do okay?  We've got to check things out first.  Show us a little something.  His face.  Keep grabbing it.  His face is good for adult films.  Very handsome gentleman.  You think so?  Beautiful eyes.  What?  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  He's got this.  What market do you think he would do well in?  What niche would he fit? 
[00:32:00]  Is there like a...  Bear.  Can you please say that again?  Bear.  You'd be a bear.  Bear.  See, he doesn't think he has bear qualities, but everyone tells him the same thing.  You're like the third person to tell him that.  Get out for us.  Get out for him.  Sir.  Thank you very much.  I'm a bear cow.  I got the bear in here.  What?  Wow.  I forgot how utterly embarrassing that bear bill was. 
[00:32:30]  You really do fit.  Apparently.  Apparently.  They really like you as a bear.  Yeah.  There aren't many bear pornos that are made.  Why if it's such a big thing?  I don't know.  I always thought there were.  There's a whole...  There's booth...  There were booths after booth with like these big burly guys and, you know, chaps.  So I was assuming that...  The guy tried to grab his cock.  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  Right when Jimmy told him to, you know, to take a look at me, the guy reached in for my...  See, that's another thing about these stupid conventions and stuff. 
[00:33:00]  They assume everyone there is fine with just being grabbed by another man, your cock being  grabbed, your tits, girls just right up there, hey, a guy will grab her pussy right there  in front of everybody.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it's commonplace there, but when you're not ready for it and the gay  guy goes in for the grab, it's...  At least be ready for it, right?  Right.  Exactly.  Do you want to fluff up a little, stupid?  Make it plump?  I'm just not going to...  The guy did that bear. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, he did.  Well, it gets better.  Now we get to talk to Tanya, the unconvincing tranny.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, her.  Oh, boy.  What's this about?  I don't know.  Don't look at me.  I don't remember.  We interviewed Tanya last year, and she's a brutish-looking transvestite.  Hi, Daddy.  One of those with the voice and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, blonde, a lot of silicone injections in her lips, but uneven.  So one lip is sort of like up there, and the other one's down there, and it just doesn't 
[00:34:00]  look good.  And, you know, Jim wanted to...  Wanted to talk with her.  And, Steve, you got some good news from her.  Yes, I do.  Okay, we're about to interview Tanya, who probably is the most unpassable tranny I've ever seen  in my life.  Who does she look like, besides not any woman you've ever seen?  I think we interviewed Tanya last year.  We did.  And it looks worse this year than it did last year.  I think there's a lot more surgery that's been done.  You think so?  Yeah, I think so. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Apparently by Dr. Brick.  All right.  Did we interview you for a radio show?  Okay.  I remember you.  I'm from last.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  I know.  Okay.  Good.  Sit down, sweetie.  All right, buddy.  We've been walking around ABN, and he wants to be a part of ABN.  Do you think that that face would sell in adult films?  But it ain't about the face.  It's about the penis.  But by his face, what niche would he fit?  The only way his face is going to make it in the Internet, if there's a penis involved 
[00:35:00]  in his face.  So you're saying his face alone is not enough to sell anything?  Not in males.  The only way a face is going to sell a male product is possibly to gays.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  I'm sorry.  You don't look like queerbait to me.  Thank you.  Wow.  Thank you.  That's amazing.  Is that why you left that in there?  I'm so happy.  You're the first person to say that.  Everybody else had said he fits the bear category.  You just wanted people to hear that you don't fit the queerbait category. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I just...  Can I have one piece of audio that defends me?  Is there?  That one?  That wasn't.  No.  A tranny that looks like a man saying you don't look right for the part.  It didn't look like queerbait.  You know what her face looks like?  She looks like a boxer from like the 50s.  Like she should...  Like the lip is kind of up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She really looks like she's been knocked around a little.  Yeah.  The cheekbones weren't really even.  You still say she.  Wait.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  I had her respect.  Hold on.  I'll give you the website.  I had her respect.  I had her respect.  All right.  Next is Delilah Strong.  Delilah Strong.  That was...  Anything?  I don't know.  She's a porn actress.  Laszlo and I interviewed her.  Oh, she wanted to tell us how she got into the porn business.  Okay.  With Smash Pictures, I guess she works for her.  Oh, yeah.  We were at the Smash Pictures booth.  And yeah, we were advised to go ask her how she got into the porn business by Yoshi,  actually.  Answer is always a drunk uncle, a bottle of whiskey, and a...  Not far off.  ...summer night with an open window. 
[00:36:30]  Delilah, I've seen you in a few movies.  I think you were in Brandon Irons' 50 to 1, right?  That's right.  And how long have you been in the business?  Two years.  I have over 150 movies out today.  Jesus.  And what prompted a lovely girl such as yourself to get into this business?  Well, my mom was in the business, so it was kind of an opening door for me.  Who's your mom?  Debra Cox.  81, 82.  She put out about 12 movies.  A lot of girls.  A lazy bitch.  Really?  Yeah, but I think it was probably my first sexual experience that really made me understand 
[00:37:00]  that I was such a whore.  And tell us about your first sexual experience.  I was 14.  I was over at my girlfriend's house, and her dad was kind of flirting with me.  She went to bed early.  We were hanging out.  Long story short, I ended up sucking his dick.  And at the very last moment when he came, I didn't realize that people didn't swallow.  I kind of thought, that's what you were supposed to do.  So I swallowed it.  And so I've always been a swaller.  And after that, after I told my friends about it, they said, I was such a dirty whore. 
[00:37:30]  And I said, you know what?  There's only one line of work for me.  What did your friend do when she found out that you sucked her dad's dick?  She didn't talk to you anymore.  I didn't have a lot of friends in high school because I fucked everybody's boyfriends.  That's a good way to make a lot of enemies.  It happens, but fuck it, right?  Sex is sex!  Ah, you know, at least she tied it all up in the end with that explanation. 
[00:38:00]  Sex is sex.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right, one more clip from the point.  Wait, can we just maybe, you know, jerk off to that one for a while?  How fantastic was that?  And it's so wrong, you're supposed to vilify that guy.  What a filthy, filthy whore she is.  Yeah, you're supposed to think, oh my God, that man is awful.  And the whole time Laszlo and I are talking to her, she's pulling her panties down and  showing us her vag. 
[00:38:30]  And I think the two of us at that point had been so desensitized, we didn't even notice  that it was going on.  Well, maybe Laszlo did.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Where was that going?  I don't know.  Did you notice the vag?  Yeah, you didn't notice the vag.  You could be in bear porno and Tranny grabbed your cock.  So why wouldn't you notice the vag?  I think I was so taken back by the story.  Yeah.  Maybe not.  If I had a mousetrap, I'd smash my hand in it, but I don't think I'd.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  So.  You didn't notice the.  You really just sit here.  You love the fact that I'm sweating.  Why are you sweating?  It's so long.  What?  Well, yeah, they really aren't dainty lashes.  Thank you.  They're very long.  Clockwork orange eyes.  And how many vagids do you have to see before you don't notice them anymore?  You're desensitized.  I don't know.  I've seen a lot.  I've seen a lot.  I watch a lot of porn.  So.  So.  I should have just.  Well, no, after talking to all the men, you just, you didn't notice the dirty thing with  teeth.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Filthy hatchet wound.  I just didn't pay attention.  Dirty, dirty.  Pillars.  It seems logical, I guess.  What the hell?  Yeah.  I'm sure everyone out there, you know.  Yeah, I should have kept that comment to myself.  Yeah.  For a guy with chains on his chest tries to grab your cock, why would you notice a vagina?  You're absolutely right.  I apologize.  Why would you try to cleanse the palate with a nice young vag?  No, she was lovely.  I just didn't notice until Laszlo brought it up.  But.  Okay.  One hundred and fifty movies or whatever it was in two years. 
[00:40:00]  She's a busy girl.  Yeah.  She used to tuck her pussy in so she doesn't close the car door on it.  What a mess.  Jesus.  One more clip.  It's Delilah Strong.  You were essentially molested at 14.  And you just thought it was acceptable.  It was way to kill the vibe, Steve.  You just start blowing guys all the time?  I didn't consider her being sexually molested.  I wanted it.  I probably antagonized him a little.  You know, wearing little short shorts and flirting.  But, you know, I guess it's considered molestation.  I think in any court, in any state in this country, it would be called molestation. 
[00:40:30]  That's true.  Fuck it.  Way to go, Ironside.  Yeah.  This is a hot story.  Well, technically, I think that violates.  What are you trying to do, break her down into tears?  Well, that was kind of, you know.  All right, oh my God, where am I in my life?  I was really, I didn't want to sit there acting like I condoned it.  You know, it was sort of like, I wanted to see what her reaction would be.  You're at the porn convention at the church.  Yeah, but that, like, yeah, it was a hot story, but, you know, at some point. 
[00:41:00]  Good, good, I'm glad he fucked you.  Did mom come in, too?  That's how it's supposed to go.  You should start your own lawyer show, Perry Cockblocker.  She didn't mind.  It obviously wasn't a big deal after I said you were molested.  She even said it was, you know, she was kind of asking for it.  Provoking the situation.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, let's go to Brian on Long Island.  Brian?  Yeah, I want to know if Jimmy likes playing with the fucking yambags.  No, sir.  No, sir?  No.  He sounds like listening to this show that he does. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, him and Steve were getting more excited over gay guys than they would over...  No, no, no, no, Jim was getting excited.  What you don't understand is this.  To get the audio, I agree with the guys, most of the audio you're going to get is just going  to be nonsense, so I figured we would do something silly and try to get guys just to confirm  that Steve looks like a bear to make him uncomfortable.  That doesn't constitute liking playing with the yambag.  I think you guys like...  In fact, they have to explain that.  Hold on, what's that, sir?  You want to reach through and hit him.  I definitely think he likes playing with a yambag over there, it sounds like.  No, sir.  That's not what it is. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Travis from West Virginia.  Hey, this is Travis.  I got a confirmed, Steve's desensitizing thing about pussy.  Work in a strip club, and after you see about 50 or 60 other things every two or three days,  you don't even look at them anymore.  I agree with you, sir, but right after you're talking to a bunch of gay guys and one with  a chain who calls you a bear and goes, grr, and then you go, grr, back to not notice  a vagina is a little odd.  And Steve did go, grr, back.  Louder and more enthusiastically than he had to. 
[00:42:30]  I certainly did not.  You did so.  Grr.  I could have done it with my mouth closed.  You and your pretty eyes.  He got cocky after that, too.  Like, he was opening his eyes wide, talking to everybody.  Which clip?  I did not.  Which clip was it where Steve went, grr, back?  Oh, please.  Steve, which clip is it?  Was it at the end of one of the clips?  It was one of the tiger clips, I think.  Yeah, I remember his name.  Tiger.  All right, hold on.  Let me see if I got it.  Yeah, he grabbed my dick.  Grr.  Go back.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Thank you very much. 
[00:43:00]  I got a bear in here.  Yeah, that was sexy.  Why would you agree to the grr?  Because stupid here was prodding me to do it.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Just do it.  I wouldn't have grr'd a tiger.  You certainly would have.  Tiger grr'd at you when you grr'd back at him.  That's what happened to the community.  It's a shame we don't have video of him nudging me.  Just go along with it.  Go along with it.  It just came out.  It was an instinct.  Tiger went, grr, and Steve went, grr.  They're like the masons.  It's like the one gives the sign, and Steve gave the secret grr shake back. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I did not.  I did not.  Well, it sounds like you two had a lot of fun.  We did have fun.  Jimmy and I always have fun at the porn awards.  It was porn convention.  It was porn convention.  It was porn convention.  It was.  It was cute.  Dirty.  Dirty whores.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Right here.  On Sirius XM.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  Uh, Cody in Indiana.  Hey, morning, fellas.  Good morning, Cody.  Morning. 
[00:44:00]  Uh, I heard you guys touch a few times on the Arbutt Dwyer video.  Yeah.  And maybe a couple days before, uh, the first time I heard you say something was the first  time I saw it, and this guy is the most selfish fucking motherfucker and saddest dude I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta agree with him.  He's got himself in the face.  Gotta agree with him, Mikey.  So hard that it messes up his hair.  Yeah, his hair flies off his head.  Cody, have you ever seen the rap video they made out of that?  Uh, no, I haven't. 
[00:44:30]  It's fantastic.  I gotta get my buddy Buzzy to maybe, uh, mail me a copy.  He still has it.  Uh, you know, I've heard you guys talk about it, and I've never, you know, you've talked  about it in passing, but never heard what you think about, you know, stuff like that  as far as it affecting the things that you've seen and stuff like that.  I can't, uh, I can't watch it.  Yeah, me either.  It's really, really disturbing to me.  Uh, I could watch the rap video that was made out of it.  They put that video to a beat, so you see his hair going up and down, up and down. 
[00:45:00]  And then they forward and reverse it, so it looks like he's dancing almost to the beat  of the song as he's shooting himself in the head.  It's, uh...  A buddy of mine moved away, and I left a message on his MySpace that had a little GIF file of him  putting the gun in his mouth, and I'm taking it out, and it said, I miss you so much, I  could kill myself, but I won't.  Oof.  Wow.  Car crash?  You know, and man.  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  That, uh, that clip, things like the ogre-ish, you know, you've got ogre-ish, I know Jimmy 
[00:45:30]  likes going there.  Ben loves that thing.  Ben loves it.  I can't watch that.  I'll watch any form of pornography you want to show me.  I will watch it.  Girl, horse.  Guy, horse.  I don't care.  Guy, chicken.  I don't care what kind of sick, deranged sex is going on.  Well, because you believe in death now, that's why.  I used to, I could watch a beheading like it was, uh, and eat potato chips when I was  younger, man.  No, even as a kid, things like that disturb me. 
[00:46:00]  I, my, my, my parents, in all their infinite fucking wisdom, back in, I guess, 1967, or  whatever the hell it was, 68, decided to take me to the drive-in to go see Bonnie and  Clyde with Warren Beatty.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I was, how old was I, six years old, something like that?  And I, uh, I'm watching it, and I thought it was kind of cool movie, gangster thing, a  little gross and stuff, but at the end, when Bonnie and Clyde just get mowed down, and- 
[00:46:30]  Oh, that's so fake, though.  I know, but, dude, at the time, for, for six, I get it.  Now, for, for your, you're a six-year-old kid, it's like 1968, so, you know, you're not-  And this was before Star Wars, when, you know, it explains those eyes.  You're not used to seeing, yeah.  He's a fucking pussy.  I didn't know Andy was a-  You're not used to seeing that shit.  Andy's a puss.  We had gone to Arby's before the theater, or the movies, because, you know, the Comac  Drive-In that used to be there?  There was an Arby's across there, and I just loaded up on Arby's, had my little puppy belly 
[00:47:00]  all full, and, and I'm watching, and then there it is, Warren Beatty, and, uh, what's  her name?  Faye Dunaway.  Faye Dunaway.  Get out of the car, the little birds go, who-choo-choo-choo-choo, out of the bushes where  the gunmen are, and then, like, uh, Bonnie, uh, uh, Clyde looks over at Bonnie, they look  at each other like, we're fucked, here it comes, and-  Just machine gun fire, their eyes getting shot out, blood, I fucking went, bleh, I threw  my Arby's up all over my father's car, all over the Rambler. 
[00:47:30]  Every year you learn, you put the Anthony puzzle together.  Here's the new part of the puzzle.  This is why, during his explanation, you can see Anthony's a hopeless romantic, that's  why he's very monogamous.  You're right.  He's romantic, because part of that story was, they looked into each other's eyes, and  that's what he pitches for him and his woman, that something goes down, and they just both  go out in a blaze of fucking glory.  You're a romantic, you're a utopian, you're an ass. 
[00:48:00]  You just hoped the world was better.  How do you do this show, Dave?  I know Anthony goes home and cries, and praise the God that God knows it's just a, God, thank  you, I only do this for money.  Like, Opie really enjoys destroying a life.  He'll talk about it later, like, dude, I thought it was funny when he just, when he  had pubic hair on his face, and his mother called in and was crying, it was hilarious.  Anthony's like, when they looked into each other's eyes, and it was, did you, I'm thinking, 
[00:48:30]  did you cry on a slap scene in Jaws?  When the lady came over and go, you knew my, you knew it was a shark?  The little Kittner voice.  Did you hear that fucking, did you hear that explanation about the movie?  Yeah, I don't know when did I hear it, I saw his eyes.  And they wadded up.  They started to blink a little too long.  Like Pussy Booth from Shrek 2.  They, oh, it sounded horrible.  Anthony has feelings.  They looked at, did you catch that? 
[00:49:00]  They looked at, that was the part that made him throw up, is the love.  The love that was destroyed.  It was metaphoric.  It was, because they just saw, like, oh, fuck, we've been through all this shit.  How do you feel about the shooting scene, the sunny scene at the toll booth?  Did you throw up?  No, I was older.  I was older by then.  Didn't see it in the movie theater.  But that didn't really get to me.  Why?  It was worse.  When I watched fucking Sonny get cut down, he starts to scream.  They shoot him so much.  That is one of the most realistic gun scenes I've ever fucking seen. 
[00:49:30]  That is horrific.  Where he just gets shot to the point where he goes, stop killing me.  I'm dead, all right?  I just haven't fallen down yet.  I saw Bonnie and Clyde.  They had the fake tummy gun movement.  Yeah.  And the thing that pained you was the love that was destroyed.  Maybe that was it.  I didn't even realize it until you're saying now.  I just told everybody.  Fuck!  Maybe.  You know, I leave this. 
[00:50:00]  You really have feelings.  Sometimes I leave this place.  Of course he does.  And I go, all right, we may have destroyed a life, but think of the joy we have given to  so many people.  He always makes deals with himself.  He makes...  I'm constantly having an internal monologue dialogue with myself.  You make spiritual deals with yourself to say it's not so bad.  It really bothers him, some of the things he did.  But that was my angle with my dad, because my dad would call me out on stuff that we did  on this show.  I'm like, but dad, there's a lot of people that are commuting, and we're just entertaining 
[00:50:30]  them, and they have miserable lives, and they found enjoyment in that.  So maybe I hurt one person, but I made thousands of people very happy that day.  Very happy.  One person had to be sacrificed.  No, that's how I had to explain it to my dad, because he was like, what is wrong?  Do you ever feel bad?  What's the...  Has there ever been a time you went home and went, fuck?  Not, fuck, we might get fired.  Right, there's been plenty of others. 
[00:51:00]  And I'll tell you one thing, Patrice.  Now that you bring that up quickly, that overrides any feeling bad.  The, oh, fuck, we fucked up, we might get fired.  That is an override in my head.  I could give a flying fuck.  The eyes go away.  Yeah.  The fucking feelings.  The awe.  All goes down the shitter.  All right, we know.  When I think my fucking job is on the line.  No, I wouldn't...  The fired.  Right.  We know fired.  Top priority.  Super sees everybody. 
[00:51:30]  And then you probably qualified to fire like, hey man, you know, Steve-O and E-Rock gotta  eat too, baby.  We're responsible for the lives to make you feel better.  But has there ever been a moral one where you just went, that...  Wasn't there one thing that, like in the studio, and we decided like, oh my God, there was  one thing.  Patty?  Nothing?  I think it was...  Nah, nah.  Patty thinks easy.  Was it the crying midget?  The midget we made get naked and she started crying? 
[00:52:00]  That was...  That was close.  We made the midget...  That was a close one.  I'll be honest.  Now somebody...  Within an hour after the show, I was eating a steak somewhere and drinking some wine or  whatever going, wow, that was a great show.  Lenny Clark wanted...  Was it Lenny?  Yes.  Yeah, it was a porn midget, wasn't it?  Lenny Clark wanted a naked midget.  Opie knows the story because he knows everything that has ever happened.  He's a walking fucking library.  Honestly, I don't know if Lenny Clark was involved, but I know the story was something  like this.  There was a midget and she was trying to become a stripper. 
[00:52:30]  She wasn't in porn yet.  Oh, right.  You were talking about the porn midget that was really cool.  We interviewed her as well.  No, I think I know the one you're talking about.  She was just a miserable midget.  She was from Long Island or Queens or something and she called Steve or somebody and said,  look, I'm a midget.  Because we were talking about getting midgets on the show a long time ago and she wanted  to be a stripper.  And we're like, have you ever stripped before?  She goes, no, I haven't done anything, but I want to maybe give this a try.  We'll set it up where it's like a strip club.  So we're like, well, why didn't you strip for us for the first time? 
[00:53:00]  So she comes in and she's such a little thing that she's standing right on the console in  front of us.  We're all kind of just looking up at this midget.  Not only that, this console wasn't like it is in here.  You see, we got a lot of headroom.  There were a lot of electronic shelving and stuff over our heads.  So she was the only human being, and I use that term loosely, that was able to stand up,  completely stand up between this shelving and stuff, which was, it made it hysterical 
[00:53:30]  that she fit in there.  She was so short.  And she's standing up on the console and we're all watching.  We put on some, you know, Motley Crue or some fucking cliche strip club music and get  her dancing.  And we start like telling her to take her clothes off.  And you can tell she's pretty reluctant.  She doesn't really want to do it.  And she starts undressing.  Yeah.  I guess she got her top off.  Yeah.  And she realized this is just not for her.  This was a bad idea.  But at this point, we've been whipped up into a frenzy.  And, you know. 
[00:54:00]  So she just kind of was like, her eyes went blank, Patrice.  They just went to another place.  A whole nother land.  The land of Oz.  And we're, you know, kind of suggesting she take her pants off and her panties.  And she's just falling apart.  You can see it just falling apart.  Yeah, and she's just in her panties with them midget legs and stuff.  With them fat.  And the big, like, Popeye arms.  The big, fat midget legs.  She got the fat little bent midget legs.  All her limbs look like little baseball, wiffle ball bands. 
[00:54:30]  With that meat.  She got them.  That meat by the knee.  Fucking cocktail Frank fingers.  Oh, God damn.  And then toes.  And then she's like topless.  And she's getting ready to like take her pants off.  And then she just loses it, starts crying.  She starts crying.  Says, I can't do this.  And we're just like, uh.  She's like, I know.  I can't.  And she's trying to cover up with that little fucking hand that looks like a muffin.  And she's like holding over her breasts and trying to.  See, that's where I was.  And it was like, we just went like. 
[00:55:00]  See, that doesn't bother me.  Because I could have talked her into not feeling that way.  You know what I mean?  Because she had a feeling.  Yeah, but there's no fun in that.  But it's.  But she.  But your whole anger would have been.  Girl, you're up there.  Just let go of any dignity you have left.  Yeah, because you already.  Being an obscure midget.  Who's thinking about stripping.  Is way worse than a stripping midget.  That makes you somebody for a couple of years, bitch.  Right.  And fetish.  A lot of motherfuckers have those midget fetishes or whatever. 
[00:55:30]  But that wouldn't bother me.  You know.  Like Patty, Patty standing there looking like Auschwitz.  Really bothered me.  Like she just was a.  That shivery old mess.  And it just.  Bag of bones.  And I know by the time.  You know when I stopped feeling bad for Patty.  Is when she was.  And I'm talking about the mousetrap thing.  Yeah.  Is when she was crawling.  And you could tell she was.  In it.  Into the thing.  Where she was like.  Oh God.  It hit my arm.  And then. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, what is that?  And I go.  Okay.  She's doing it.  But just.  That nakedness right there.  It bogged.  That fucking got to me.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Man.  You can't feel for someone that doesn't feel.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jesus Christ.  My latest quote.  I know there was one.  I know there was one thing.  How do you feel for someone that doesn't feel?  He's.  He's.  See.  Opie has.  Opie.  Whatever he made a deal with.  Whatever force.  He has made a deal with. 
[00:56:30]  See.  He'll never get fired from like.  From radio.  He'll always have a job at radio.  He'll get fired.  For two years.  It's like.  You're like.  Whatever.  It's just a funny.  You know.  Whoever he made a deal with.  Just was like.  Oh man.  I'm joking.  You guys get another job.  Like.  That's what XM is.  I'm fucking with you guys man.  Just fucking with you.  You got a job.  It's like.  You know.  It's like.  When you're not a motherfucking say.  The genie.  You know.  When you make a wish for a genie.  Uh huh.  And they go.  I want to have.  A big dick.  And then the genie.  If he's an asshole.  He'll just make your whole body a dick. 
[00:57:00]  A big dick.  Right.  Just with some eyes on it.  Never works.  It's like.  Whoever made the dopey man.  He's comfortable with the deal he made.  He said fuck it.  Right.  Oh he's the only guy comfy with the deal.  You're not comfy with the deal.  I.  Ah.  I have my own ways of justifying what I do.  But I will never share that with anybody.  That's.  He.  I swear to God.  You know what.  You ever seen fucking Golden Child.  Mm hmm.  My explanation.  He goes into a room.  And it turns.  It turns into hell.  He sits on top of a little mountain.  And it's like.  I'll be right back baby.  He sits on a mountain. 
[00:57:30]  And he goes.  And my fuck goes.  Oh boo.  What happened today?  Hey man.  We made a bitch kid naked and mousetraps.  Oh nigger please.  Don't worry about it man.  Shit.  I did shit.  My explanation Patrice.  My explanation is so easy.  Oh.  So easy.  And you would go.  Wow.  That makes a lot of sense.  Go ahead.  I'll never say it.  Oh man.  What's wrong with you man?  What the fucking wrong with you?  Now you got it.  That would take down.  Would you even allow anybody else to do that?  That would take down all four walls. 
[00:58:00]  Then the ceiling hits us in the head.  That's right.  Fair enough.  But I'm telling you right now.  It is the easiest explanation.  Is it a paragraph?  Is it a saying?  Is it some spiritual thing?  Or is it just no?  It's just simple.  No.  It's not.  It's beyond simple.  Is it something easy like fuck it?  Fuck it.  It's beyond simple.  Let's go to Mike.  Oh, I know what it is.  What?  Opens up the bank book.  Oh, you buy it. 
[00:58:30]  You buy it.  Let me just get online and check my balance.  All right.  Let's see.  All is right with the world, motherfucker.  Let's see.  I'm starting to feel bad about myself.  Let's check the bank account in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Check this one.  Which account will I check today?  Let me spin the wheel.  All right.  I'll check that corporate account.  I know you have.  Is it all worth it?  Things in your head.  You know, I'll be completely honest with you. 
[00:59:00]  There are times and there have been situations, and I can't remember.  There's like one that me and I...  Stop playing, Anthony.  It's so bad it went out of your head.  You can...  But Anthony's...  Anthony is...  That's why he stays in his house.  Yeah.  Motherfucker, Anthony stays in his house.  It's coming together after 17 years.  It's because the world, the weight of the world...  You don't watch a lot of news either, do you?  No, I watch a lot of news.  And it doesn't bother you?  It does bother me, yeah.  I would have thought that you don't watch the news, you don't come out... 
[00:59:30]  Because even homeless people...  You want to give money to every homeless.  You want to help.  Oh, my God.  You're making me too simple now.  Not simple, but you have...  No, no, your explanation is too simple now, because I don't fit into the mold you're trying  to fit me into.  I almost fit, but they're like, well, I can't get the arm in there.  What the fuck is it?  There are a few things that make no sense with this picture you're putting in here.  Homeless people, I could give a flying fuck about them. 
[01:00:00]  And Patrice...  I feel no guilt when I get annoyed at them.  I dish out.  To the homeless.  Absolutely.  That's why you'll never understand this relationship in this radio show.  Just when you think you've got it figured out, you're like, what?  I swear to God when I see those guys...  So perhaps the staff should dress in stinky clothing when they go out to dinner with you. 
[01:00:30]  Yep.  A little more complex.  It's not that bad.  Just a little more complex.  I'm not far away from utopia.  I have some sympathy for the pains of the world.  You have a utopia...  Yes.  I do.  I feel some sympathy for the pains going on in the world.  You're like a middle-aged Italian version of the Green Mountain.  What?  Oh, I got flies coming out of my room.  Here's the question today, and the guy just hung up on us.  What's the worst thing Anthony has done on this show?  Because if you ask that question about me, there's a million that come up.  You're the...  You are the... 
[01:01:00]  He's done some horrific things, too, though.  I've done some bad stuff.  That you started?  There was a time when we were in Boston.  Anthony enjoyed calling funeral homes.  Oh, right.  And asking to talk to the deceased.  Yeah, you know how they list the funerals?  This is a funny bit.  And original, goddammit, thought this up.  You go through the obituaries, and they list where and when the service is going to be.  So when the service is there, you call up, and whoever answers, you go, like, is John Smith there today? 
[01:01:30]  And they say yes, because he's laid out there.  They think you're asking, obviously, you're asking if the body is there.  Is John Smith there?  Yes.  Could you put him on the phone?  The silence.  The dead silence.  The deathening silence.  That you just get, and then you get, yeah, he's there.  Just put him on.  I really need to talk to him.  He's the deceased. 
[01:02:00]  You get, like, this puzzled fucking, and we laugh our fucking ass off.  We laugh and laugh and laugh.  The Alzheimer's home that we called.  Oh, shit.  That was you on YouTube?  Yeah.  Oh, fun, fun stuff.  Was that your idea to call the Alzheimer's thing?  I don't know whose idea it was, but I...  It does count.  I did it.  It counts.  What do you mean?  When we called, oh, Bill, the Alzheimer's clinic.  Oh, oh, oh, that is like...  Hello, thank you, please. 
[01:02:30]  You've heard this, right?  No.  Oh, my God.  Is it even on this version?  Four or three old bitties at this Alzheimer's helpline and called up and just made them  feel so badly for this poor old lost guy who was me.  You've never heard this?  No.  You've been with us for years.  Oh, Bill.  By the way, someone is calling you out saying that you were there for the dancing midget,  Patrice.  Are you shitting me?  Patrice was there for that?  The chick wasn't crying?  That chick wasn't crying?  The one that stopped dancing in the middle of it?  That chick... 
[01:03:00]  That's why I don't remember.  It didn't bother me.  That chick was crying?  Dude, we had to stop the bitties.  I was there.  Yeah, we did stop the bitties.  I was there in the fucking room.  Holy shit.  Wait, but Nicole Starr might be the porn midget.  That sounds like a porn midget name.  See, there's a confusion here because we got to...  I was there during a minute.  Get your fucking midget straight.  Nicole Starr was one naked midget that was on the air.  Yeah, of course we've had more than one naked midget. 
[01:03:30]  That's the one I'm thinking of.  I think that's the one he's talking about.  God, where else can you hear an argument where guys are like,  Well, Jesus, we had more than one naked midget.  No, it wasn't that midget.  It wasn't that midget, motherfucker.  I remember what midget it was.  I got the arguments over which naked midget.  I was at a midget very early in the time when I stopped coming to the show.  And that's what I'm saying.  It didn't bother me. 
[01:04:00]  Alright, Nicole Starr, the naked midget.  What's this?  A porn site midget with morals?  I don't get it.  There's a thousand pictures of this chick without her pants on, yet she gets all nervous around us.  Yeah, that's the chick that is an actual porn star midget.  We're talking about a girl that wanted to get into stripping.  I wasn't there.  We brought her in.  Off the street midget.  I wasn't there.  We brought her in off the street.  She awkwardly started taking her clothes off and then just lost it.  I wasn't there.  Started crying.  And someone was saying that Colin Hanks was there. 
[01:04:30]  Colin Hanks?  It was Colin Hanks and Jack Black.  Jack Black.  Jack Black.  Alright, that was with the porn star midget.  Right, that was porn star midget.  Alright, see, everyone's getting it confused.  By the way, two more guys.  We were talking about this yesterday that no longer do the show.  Oh, hell yeah.  Forget about it.  Jack Black.  You never get Jack Black.  Jack Black used to do our show.  He was plugging Tenacious D back then.  That was it.  Jack Black would come in and do our show every time he was in New York, and we haven't seen him in years.  His biggest movie then was that...  Ak, ak, ak, ak. 
[01:05:00]  Mars Attack.  Mars Attack.  And Tom Hanks' son came in, and it turns out that he was such a...  He was a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony program.  He was getting bootleg tapes of our show sent to L.A., and he came in.  He couldn't believe he was on our show, and now he's blown up.  He was in King Kong.  He was in King Kong as well.  I don't think he's blown up yet, though.  He's getting there.  He's in the shadow of God.  Ah, you never know.  Maybe we'll get him.  Nah, we're done.  I think it's possible to get Tom Hanks' son again.  Yeah.  I think so, but maybe...  Tom's probably like, look it. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Don't fuck up Da Vinci code for me.  Yeah.  I grew this hair like this.  I got to fucking walk around like this.  I want it to work out.  This is the question of today, though.  What is the worst thing Anthony has done on this program?  Trying to think.  Some people are saying this.  I'm going to play this for Patrice because he's never heard it.  But here's how I qualify the worst thing, though.  Mm-hmm.  Participating...  Yes.  ...in Opie's evil does not count.  To me.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Because some of...  But, like, Anthony, you...  Hold on.  Some of the evil... 
[01:06:00]  Nah, nah, some of the evil, he's right there with me, man.  I know.  He's talking about initiating...  I'm talking about...  I'm talking about...  It's like...  It's like gang mentality.  It's like, Opie might be the first one to hit Rodney King with the thing.  And Anthony's like, all right, fuck it.  I hit him in his kneecap, too.  I'd rather use the Reginald Denny explanation on this one.  I didn't know.  Yeah, the one guy hits him with the fucking brick, and then the other guy came in and  kicked.  You're the dancer.  Please let me...  I'm the dancer.  I want to know, because every interview... 
[01:06:30]  Opie's the guy that laid the brick over his head.  Every fucking interview...  Sorry, Stephen.  Every interview, you know, Opie's, you know, the bad guy.  You're always...  You're never an antagonist.  I've never seen you an antagonist.  Unless somebody's, like, really a dick.  Right, but that's the way...  But I've never seen it.  That's the way it works.  What about Anthony the...  Thank you!  God damn it!  Thank you, Dirk, from Massachusetts.  Uh-oh, what did I do?  Anthony the faith healer.  Say no more!  Okay, that was pretty bad.  All right. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  The only time we almost got killed...  That was at a live appearance.  The only time we almost started a riot...  Wheelchair Fred.  ...was because of him.  Wheelchair Fred.  I hate...  I was pretty drunk.  My shit has never caused a riot.  My shit has never caused things to be thrown at us.  I got all caught up in the moment.  We were at a live appearance.  Up in Boston.  And, uh...  We had a character on the show.  He's been on this show.  Wheelchair Fred.  The guy had a motorcycle accident years ago.  He sounds like he's, uh... 
[01:07:30]  Retarded.  He talks like this.  You can barely understand the word he says.  It's like his throat was crushed.  His legs were twisted apart.  They put him together all fucked up because he had no insurance.  Then he's in a wheelchair.  Matter of fact, when we go to break, Derek, find the bit wheelchair Fred taking a little  dildo up his poop chute.  Yeah, that's always a fun one.  Gives you a little insight on wheelchair Fred.  He did it on the XM show.  He was so desperate.  We got him...  We got him...  This is what I love.  I love this shit. 
[01:08:00]  We got him naked on the phone.  He staggered to his bathtub with a dildo and he did himself in the bathtub.  He did himself with a dildo because he needs sex so bad.  He's so horny.  We'll play the viral promo that has that as we go to break.  So we were doing an appearance.  We used to do a lot of these things in Boston.  And the place was packed.  We'd go up there and give away shirts and shit and have people come up and show us your  fucking weirdest scar for this fucking bit of shit from the radio station. 
[01:08:30]  You know, typical stuff.  And wheelchair Fred was there, so we brought him up on stage.  And now I had seen wheelchair Fred.  He didn't have spinal cord damage.  So it wasn't like he was paralyzed.  His legs were just so fucked up that he couldn't walk.  So he was in a wheelchair.  But I had seen him at the station get out of his chair and steady himself on the console  and kind of shaky leg.  But he took his hands away and he'd be standing.  So I thought it would be great.  Holy crap. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Trying to make yourself feel good.  No, no, no.  You can't even...  That was the...  That was my...  You can't even record how long he was standing without his hands.  Oh, I know.  It was like...  I'm not trying to say...  No hands.  What'd you say?  You couldn't even record.  No recorder that can record as fast as he fell.  Point, 20 zeros, and then a one.  That's how long he could stand.  But the fractions don't go that long.  But, you know, I had a few in me.  I had a few in me.  So I get this idea. 
[01:09:30]  Point, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.  Now, the people didn't know this.  A lot of people thought Fred was paralyzed.  Oh, my God.  So I get this idea.  So he was a known...  Yeah.  Like, radio cat figure on the show.  Known to be paralyzed.  Wheelchair Fred, yeah.  Thought to be completely paralyzed.  Thought to be paralyzed.  A lot of people misunderstood.  It wasn't just his, you know, fucked up legs.  They thought he was paralyzed.  You know, Christopher Reeve paralyzed.  Oh, my goodness.  So I think...  I get drinking some beers with the excitement on stage.  We bring wheelchair Fred up. 
[01:10:00]  He gets a huge ovation because people love them.  And I get this idea.  And he's wheeling.  Yeah.  They wheel him up on stage.  Okay, he's wheeling.  They actually...  The crowd has to lift the wheelchair up and place it on the stage.  Yeah, they lifted him up onto the stage.  So he's like crowd surfing in his wheelchair for a little while.  Yeah.  And they put him up on stage.  Now, I'm thinking to myself...  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking to myself, this would look really cool because I've seen him stand up.  If I do a faith healer thing and get this crowd whipped up and he stands,  they're going to think I'm fucking Jesus Christ.  So I'm going, Fred, you want to get out of that chair? 
[01:10:30]  You want to get out of that chair?  The crowd just goes with him.  Yeah.  And he's going, yes, I want to get out of the chair.  He just goes right with you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Falls right into it.  Falls right into it.  I'm like, Fred...  He goes right with you.  And I slam my hand on his head and I'm like, Fred, feel the power of Jesus Christ flowing  through your body.  I feel it.  And the crowd is closing.  I feel Jesus.  People crying.  Dude, they were freaking out. 
[01:11:00]  And his arms now grab his armrest on his chair and start shaking.  His legs are shaking.  And every inch he moved out of that chair, the frenzy in this crowd was un-fucking-believable.  I got to the point where I actually felt like I was channeling Jesus Christ.  What kind of frenzy, like, they're screaming, like, the average, like, whoo!  Dude, you've been to our live shows.  Wide-eyed...  But was it, like...  Wide-eyed amazement. 
[01:11:30]  They thought this motherfucker was paralyzed.  Like, couldn't move.  And I'm here holding his head.  He's shaking.  And now his legs are working.  He's getting himself out of the fucking chair.  Wait a minute.  And the crowd's going nuts, and so Anthony's going nuts because the crowd's going nuts.  But is it, like, Opie and Anthony crowd nuts, or is it, like, holy shit!  It's, like, both.  A church nuts, like...  It's both.  It turned into a...  Like, you heard gasping.  Like, oh my God, Fred, go! 
[01:12:00]  Go!  Everyone got caught up in the excitement of the whole damn thing.  Everyone.  Especially me.  Oh, wait a minute.  This might just happen.  And you were just going bananas.  I'm going off.  I'm like, Fred, Fred, you don't need this chair anymore.  Feel the power of Christ.  I feel it.  I feel Jesus.  So he starts getting up.  He's holding on to the chair.  He's just...  And now he's up.  He's up.  He's standing.  But he's holding on to the chair.  And, again, the crowd just going crazy.  So I'm like, all right, Fred, let go and walk! 
[01:12:30]  And we pulled the chair away, actually.  And we kind of...  Because we're like, you don't need that chair anymore.  That chair.  Now walk to the microphone.  And he lets go of the chair.  We pull it away.  He shakes.  He wobbles a little.  He goes to take a step and falls flat on his face.  Wait.  You're missing one detail, though.  He's very close to the microphone that the lead singer is going to use, right?  With the mic stand?  Right.  So he has no wheelchair. 
[01:13:00]  And this all took place in less than a second, by the way.  He has no wheelchair.  And he realizes, oh, shit, I'm in trouble.  And grabs the mic stand that the lead singer is going to use.  Thinking he could use that to support himself.  It's not connected to anything.  Oh, my God.  He goes down like...  You just heard like...  Just...  Like the mic falling and him and...  And then just feedback from the...  The microphone. 
[01:13:30]  And then...  Dude.  We're just silent.  Dead silence in the crowd.  And then...  And then...  You'd hear like from the middle of the crowd.  You'd hear like from the middle of the crowd.  You're a fucking asshole, dude.  You fucking guys.  You motherfucking cucks.  And we're at this crowd turned in a second.  Well, but I was for real.  I was Jesus.  Patrice, we had to leave.  We had to leave.  Here's the deal, too. 
[01:14:00]  They were going to kill us.  Before we did the wheelchair Fred thing, you know, we went up there with like dopey DJs.  Hey, welcome to blah, blah, blah, blah.  And hey, here's some CDs and t-shirts and blah.  So we gave out all this crap.  Like I think the WAF ice scrapers and CDs and...  You haven't...  You didn't really establish yourself.  This was a...  I know.  Yeah, we were doing pretty good.  We were there.  Let me establish the evil that could...  Right, right.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  The potential evil hadn't been established.  Yeah, we were there, though.  So then there was dead silence. 
[01:14:30]  People were like, what the...  They're all looking at each other like, what the...  What the...  Who the...  And all of a sudden, Patrice, they started throwing...  Winging everything we gave out.  Just gave out at the stage.  AAF keychains.  Coming back at us.  Thinking like, hey, this is Joe...  Hey, it's funny.  Look at the fucking...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Why didn't you fucking go...  Hey, man, I tried.  The aristocrats.  Ta-da.  But why didn't you go, I tried.  It almost worked.  If they thought he was paralyzed... 
[01:15:00]  Patrice.  There was no talking.  How come you didn't have Fred get you out of me?  It wasn't even close to working.  Did you have to wheel Fred off, too?  Why didn't Reginald Denny just go, hey, I'm driving a truck through, guys.  Help him.  Help me out.  Come on.  Oh, my God, yo.  Wait a minute, so...  When you get hit in the face with the nice t-shirt you just gave someone...  Thank you, good night.  See you later.  So wait, how long from the time the guy goes, fuck you assholes, to just, like, you go,  we have to get the fuck out of me?  Spread like wildfire.  How long? 
[01:15:30]  Through the crowd.  Try seconds.  Yeah, seconds.  We knew we were in trouble.  We went backstage, went out the back door, into our vehicle, and out we went.  And putter down Route 9.  Bye-bye.  Do you remember the feedback from the next day, like, people calling in?  Well, that's where it kind of started, because some people, we told the story and thought  it was fucking hysterical.  Oh, yeah.  So we knew we had an audience out there.  Yeah, we went on there and told the story just how it happened.  We had Fred on.  See, because the club maybe fit, I don't know, 200 to 300 people.  So it was only 300 of our listeners that actually saw how awful we really are. 
[01:16:00]  And then we went on the radio the next day and told it to, who knows, a few hundred thousand.  But they didn't call, like, those people didn't call going, you fucking...  Here's another thing.  Here's another thing.  It was a music station.  So all the fans that came to the station events weren't just fans of Opie and Anthony.  They were fans of Metallica.  Oh, God.  You know, they're fans of fucking...  Well, it was an Alice in Chains tribute band that night, so...  Yeah, Alice in Chains tribute band was playing.  So now it's fans of the music, not necessarily all fans of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, my God.  You know, so it was just one of those situations where, yeah...  And they just start throwing shit at you.  Oh, dude, talk about bombing.  Yeah, we gotta get out of there.  That's fucking hilarious.  They had a great moment.  And you were the fucking massive commander of that shit.  I had nothing to do with that.  Catalyst of evil.  That's fucking horrendous.  I had nothing to do with that.  That was a bad one.  Oh, Jesus, what's that smell?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM. 
[01:17:00]  We're on the air.  Grab a mic.  Grab whatever mic you want.  Mike.  The dirty show.  Dennis Leary in studio.  Lenny Clark in studio.  For everybody.  This is the dirty show.  This is the clean show, Dennis.  This is the clean show.  Well, you can't say fuck.  Hey, easy.  Oh, don't...  Now they gotta dump it.  He asked me what he can and can't say.  I'm asking a technical...  Can I say tit?  No.  No, no, no.  That's been eliminated from the repertoire.  Depends on the context.  Usually, no, though.  You can call someone and ask. 
[01:17:30]  No.  Bad.  What about cock knocker?  No.  Probably yes.  Can I say cock?  Because it's an old Irish expression.  Yes, it is!  No.  You can't say cock, but you can say cock.  We're running out of delay.  Stop.  I bet we're gonna be out of delay in no time.  Wow.  At this point, we have to sound like we're underwater.  What?  Is there a guy with a button?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, no, okay.  That's what got us in trouble last time, though.  Okay, I know.  Well, no, we're not having sex in St. Patrick's.  We're just...  You want to?  ...talking.  I have actually done that, but it wasn't on the air.  And it was with a saint. 
[01:18:00]  It was against your will, and it was many years ago.  It was very interesting.  First of all, I want to acknowledge the weight loss by Mr. Lenny Clark again.  Thank you very much.  Can I explain his weight loss?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  It doesn't start with an A and end with an S, does it?  No, people talk about Robert De Niro.  Is this a very pretty explanation?  People talk about De Niro, and Robert De Niro's probably my favorite actor of all time.  It's him and Clint Eastwood to be a close reference.  Going out on a limb.  But I really admire that guy.  That guy put on 100 pounds for Raging Bull.  Yeah.  One of the greatest movies ever made.  Absolutely. 
[01:18:30]  And he rightfully so won the Academy Award.  Lenny Clark, playing Uncle Teddy on Rescue Me, killed the guy who's supposedly, you know,  in fiction, in the fake world of fake fires, ran over my son last year, and I said, Lenny,  your character's going to be on death row next year.  And this guy went out and lost 100 and how many pounds?  About 102.  102 pounds.  Because he knew in prison he would lose weight.  He wouldn't.  Yeah.  And that's why he lost the weight.  But I could put on.  How about this guy?  And meanwhile, he better get an Emmy nomination. 
[01:19:00]  If not, who are we going to take hostage if you don't get an Emmy nomination?  Jeremy Piven.  No.  We don't want to give you money for him.  No.  We could kill him.  Right, right.  No, we'll just get him out of the way.  Oh, okay.  We'll put him in a truck and leave it somewhere.  Can I ask how you lost 100 pounds?  That's got to be tough, too.  I went to weight loss.  You didn't get your stomach stapled.  No.  You know how much that is?  I looked into that.  That's 25 grand.  You're not getting my money.  Wow.  Can we say faggot?  Yeah.  Faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot. 
[01:19:30]  Anyway.  Oh, not me, right?  Good.  Okay, so I go to Weight Watchers.  There's 68 broads of me, and they're looking around.  I think that's Lenny Cock.  Isn't that Lenny Cock?  I said, hey, I'm fat.  I'm not deaf, you bitches.  I'm here to lose weight.  And then a few months later, bang, we just started flying off.  So, you know, I'm out of the...  It was...  And then I started going to the gym again, lifting weights, got a trainer, just...  So you're moving around, exercising, and eating a lot less.  Oh, yeah.  And that seems to make people lose weight.  It's a miracle, people.  Yeah.  You could actually do it.  It's called willpower. 
[01:20:00]  It's called stack or four.  Yeah.  Now, I could also go the other way.  I mean, I could put on 30 pounds in a cab ride.  That's not a problem.  I mean, I could really...  Because I was thinking...  But mentally, I think I've noticed that you don't have the same compulsions.  We were doing a press tour for a movie or for something once, a few years...  Many years ago.  And this guy, I was with him all day doing press.  And every room you went into, you know, they had, like, gourmet food and stuff.  The Ritz-Carlton.  He was eating all day.  And I was getting sick of it.  The Ritz-Carlton in L.A.  Yeah.  And finally, we go into this room, and he's eating something.  I go, what are you eating now?  He goes, I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  He didn't even know what it was.  We ate that hotel out of lobster.  He just wanted to eat.  I said, Mr. Clark, there was no more lobster.  It's like when he gave up everything else, he thought, yeah, I'll just eat myself to death.  But now, it's a different mentality.  Yeah, you had packed on some pounds during that last season.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to hit 400 before Manny Ramirez.  I'll tell you.  It was bad.  That was a nice surprise ending, though, there, with him coming out and blasting the guy.  Pulling the Jack Ruby.  Yeah, that was great.  You know?  I've known him for a long time, and he's done some great work, like Monument Ave and some 
[01:21:00]  other movies.  But that scene where he tells me about, I'm going to kill the driver, I thought he was acting-wise.  Fantastic.  Yeah, because, I mean, basically, you're known as a comedic actor.  Right.  And that was a pretty serious role.  He gets scary.  I would love to.  I've seen that in bars.  Yeah, that's the thing.  It's not like you're taking a risk, going, can Lenny do this?  Lenny, act like you're doing a bar.  He's like sitting with Charles Durney, who's an Oscar-winning actor, and he screwed the shit 
[01:21:30]  out of both of us.  Yeah.  He was good.  He was good.  He used to see the stuff he's doing in the prison scenes this year, man.  It's great.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You don't call anyone Johnny Cakes, do you?  No.  No Johnny Cakes for Lenny Clark.  Yeah, you know, if you've got to bang a guy, is it going to be 500 pounds?  Come on, man.  I don't understand that.  That's not sexy?  Not to me.  What is with two guys going at it?  What is sexy for you?  I'll tell you what's sexy.  Yeah.  Marissa Tomei, who's on the show this year.  I hear now.  Marissa Sarandon, who's on the show this year. 
[01:22:00]  My wife.  Yeah.  I'm going to get into that.  That's private.  Um, I wanted to say one thing to you guys.  How much, I can't say the F word, obviously, right?  No.  Can we go to the filthy show with you guys, too?  Right.  Because I really can't believe what you guys have.  Yeah, you can go to the filthy show, and then you can just.  Hold on.  I'd like to hear an answer to this question.  Billions, right?  Jimmy wants to know.  Yeah, Jimmy wants to know, too.  I'm really happy for you guys.  You know, I'm fancy.  Oh, look how I dress.  I mean, well, look.  Yeah, I mean.  See, I don't make much money.  Let me tell you something.  I'm really.  Dennis, let me tell you something.  How did they think of this to begin with? 
[01:22:30]  I know.  What was the David Lee Roth thing?  The David Lee Roth thing was the best thing that ever happened to the Opie and Anthony  show.  Because.  That poor son of a bitch.  Because being the guy after the guy.  No, I, you know.  Is hard.  It's hard.  But being the guy that brought the ratings down to nothing.  You know what you want, true Hollywood story?  Yeah.  And I usually don't tell these stories because I don't like to embarrass the other people.  But since it's you guys, they called me when Howard announced that he was going to  leave.  Yeah.  A guy called me and said, we want you to come out and be the guy.  And I was like, okay, first of all, I have a job that involves me writing and starring. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, I'm on a hit show.  Excuse me.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Number one.  Number two, what moron would.  You know what I mean?  What new guy would come into this format?  Because you're dead.  Yeah.  It's like being.  You might as well get in the car that Kennedy was just in with the roses and go.  Hey, wait for the gunshots, you know?  So I think to begin with the morons that run show business, as we know they all are, well,  how could they not look at you guys or even I'd have to pick, what's his name?  Corolla or somebody and go, got an established person who's already doing the same gig. 
[01:23:30]  Bring them in.  You know, bring them in.  They know the mics.  They know the system.  I think it's one of those situations where.  Spandex pants.  What was he wearing?  Yeah.  Nobody knows.  We don't even know.  Zibab.  Yeah.  Did it bad?  He wouldn't even broadcast from the studio.  Why?  No.  He thought there was asbestos floating around.  Yeah.  He was really freaking out at the studio and everything.  Maybe.  Maybe he just walked away with a bucket of money.  He probably did.  And something else we learned.  You see this unbelievable window?  Yeah.  That was covered up.  Howard didn't want that window.  He was scared of snipers. 
[01:24:00]  Snipers.  I swear to God.  The stories were being told so far.  Scared of snipers.  So this place was like a dungeon.  Look how awesome that window is.  Are you afraid of snipers?  Jim Carrey.  Really?  Now see.  You and I are actually snipers looking for you and me.  Yeah.  And they're members of our own families.  Yeah.  And the only reason they haven't killed us is they've got to take the gun with them.  Because I applied for sniper school.  And I said, what if I make a hit on a really important guy and I kill him?  He's dead.  But they're after me.  And I leave the gun. 
[01:24:30]  And I go, then you'd be fired.  And I go, I don't think I can.  And they go, you can't be a sniper.  You've got to bring the gun.  Of course you do.  It makes no sense to me.  Hey, by the way, Charles Durning actually was a sniper in World War II.  Was he?  Yeah.  He sits around the set and one day Lenny's talking about snipers.  Because we talk about that a lot.  I love snipers.  Who doesn't?  Charles Durning actually begins a story, which I would love to be able to do.  He goes, I was a sniper in World War II.  But I only killed the grunts, you know, I mean, the officers, not the grunts.  I let the soldiers live.  I killed, like, the generals.  Me and Lenny are like, this is a real story. 
[01:25:00]  This is not.  This isn't just a real guy.  He's really.  I am telling.  Yeah.  Wow.  Dennis, we're ready for you.  Hold everything.  Yeah.  Hold everything.  Keep talking, Charlie.  Yeah.  I want to hear the rest of this.  Wow.  How about that generation of guys?  We think that we're, you know, living the life.  Those guys gave us.  He's got a handprint.  He's got a handprint of a Nazi.  He killed a Nazi with a rock.  He crushed the guy's head with a rock.  I mean, he went through the guy's head.  Because he ran out of bullets after he killed the first three guys.  And he's got a handprint of five fingerprints in his left upper chest, like where the guy  dug in while he was trying to kill him.  Now, you think you're a tough guy, and you're talking to this guy, and he opens his shirt 
[01:25:30]  and goes, yeah, the cucksack could grab me here.  And you're like, oh, my God.  He's trying to rip the heart out of my chest.  Right, right.  You know?  He's trying to do Indiana Jones move on.  I don't know what you were doing.  I went to the Cape.  I was jerking off.  Well, I went to the Cape and had to pay to do that.  But, you know, the thing about it is they could have found me if they needed me.  I told them, listen, I'll be at Cape Cod.  But I'm not.  You know, if you really need me, come down here.  If you need Lenny, we know where he is.  Yeah, I'm down at Cape.  Well, you guys, come on.  What? 
[01:26:00]  How close were you to being drafted?  I was close.  My brother was actually in the lottery.  I was in the lottery.  And then his number was fairly high.  There's two kids on our block that went.  And one guy came back, screwed up.  The other guy didn't come back.  But, yeah, my brother's number was in there.  You seem a little too young, too.  I was in the year of 74, my junior year in high school.  And that's when they canceled the draft, right after my brother got picked.  You would have gone there and watched that one helicopter leave the building in Saigon.  Okay.  No, my plan was I was going to go.  I was going to bring a lot of really good weed. 
[01:26:30]  And I was going to become friends with the Vietnamese.  And forget the Paris talks.  I was going to solve it.  Oh, you were going to fix everything, a little bit of pot.  I wasn't going no matter what.  And it wasn't because of the guys.  I was going to pull it.  It was probably the snakes.  Have some rice.  Snakes, that's what kept me out of now.  Snakes kept you out of now.  Yeah, snakes and fags.  By the time you have it, it's too late, they're all over you.  Especially those attack Asian fags.  They're deadly.  And they're done with the snakes.  Who's going to hear you scream?  Forget about it.  It wasn't worth it.  Well, a lot of those Asian fags, they actually have snakes.  And they want to put those up your, you know. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, you've got to watch that.  Tunnel people.  The tunnel people.  Oh, the tunnel people.  Tunnel rats.  Yes.  Yeah.  Snakes.  And it wasn't just the tunnels that were pulled into.  They died of my life.  Alan Quinn had that great line one time.  He goes, I was in Vietnam, and it was horrible.  It's 1984.  There was no hotel rooms.  Great line.  Alan Quinn.  Wow.  So we're promoting Rescue Me, the soundtrack today?  We're promoting, yeah.  I think we're going to hand this out when we walk from here to the XM Studios.  No, not yet.  Oh, no.  No, we've got time.  Well, I want to make sure we've got some people outside, you know, Free FM here. 
[01:27:30]  Do people follow you from here to there?  Yeah.  They follow.  Okay, let me ask you this.  Do pretty young girls follow you?  No.  Look.  No, we've got to follow it.  We're working on it, Dennis.  We're hoping maybe you can bring that aspect.  A lot of fat guys to the show.  With beer bellies.  Do you want to talk about what the music is on the soundtrack or no?  No, I don't care.  Okay.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  Actually, it is really good.  It's got some great stuff on there.  First three seasons, the best of the first three seasons. 
[01:28:00]  Greg Dooley, who used to be the lead singer and songwriter for the Afghan Wigs, has got a song called Pussy Willow on there, which is a great song.  I can go through the whole thing.  I mean, it's all great.  Well, you've got Our Lady Peace.  You've got a lot of really, really cool bands that don't get a lot of airplay is what I want to say.  The soundtrack.  You know?  And my son, Jack, is listed as a consulting producer because about half these songs I found because I'd be talking to my son saying, I've got to find some music for this scene.  And he'd go, how about this?  Because, you know, he's iPod heavy.  Yeah.  He's 16.  They know.  And he's driving now. 
[01:28:30]  Jack's driving now.  I'm nervous.  Does that make you?  He's a kid.  He's a kid.  We've seen him many, many times over the years.  He's like 6'5", 6'6".  Now, hey, can we let Jim talk a little bit?  Oh, I don't mind.  I'm tired today.  I've had nothing all day.  Why not just enjoy it while men do what they do?  He puts the breathe right over his mouth today.  You're looking at us like he wants to get paid.  Not at all.  I just sit here and shut.  When I have nothing, I just shut my face.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and let everybody else.  Why are you tired?  You were out late last night?  Dude, I went to bed at 3 o'clock in the morning.  I do it every night.  He does spots.  So he...  Oh, so you go to the clubs and then you go to bed and then you get up and do this.  He takes a nap, basically. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, that sucks.  Yeah.  Well, you're...  That's a lot of money.  Dennis, you had an interesting quote in the Daily News.  Did you see this?  No.  No?  This stuff isn't sent to you?  It's going to hurt my marriage?  This one won't.  No.  Good.  Read it.  Well, it might, actually.  For goodness sake, don't ask Dennis Leary, star of FX, Rescue Me, which man he'd sleep  with if he had to.  Elle magazine did and got this answer.  I'd shoot myself in the head.  Leary couldn't resist adding, I asked this gay guy I know how he keeps his relationship  together.  He said, when we get mad, we beat the crap out of each other, then have great sex. 
[01:29:30]  So, it's basically hockey with sex, which to me sounds perfect.  It's true, though.  That's one of the hairdressers on the show.  This guy Stanley said that to me.  I mean, you know, you guys are all straight, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We've all made a few mistakes.  Now, Jimmy's going to talk.  With a beautiful young lady, with a black girl with a blonde wig, and you're like, that's  probably not her real hair.  And then you realize she has arms like Kobe.  Big back to rub.  Who am I going to do, talk to her manager? 
[01:30:00]  Just finish.  Well, there was a story that Jimmy told a while ago.  There was a little confusion.  Who doesn't love a tranny, huh?  But you know what I'm saying.  Like, you know, with women, it just gets to the point sometimes.  I mean, I know personally, I've been to hell and back.  You know, you get to the point where you just want to go like, I'm done talking, okay?  It's got to be physical nature one way or the other.  And you know, you can't hit a girl.  I mean, that's the rules.  Yeah.  And it drives you nuts.  Not with witnesses.  One day, I was in a particularly tough situation, and I said, Stanley, what do you do with your  boyfriend?  This guy's been with the same guy for 12 years. 
[01:30:30]  And that's what he said to me.  He goes, we get into a fist fight, and then we have great sex.  Just beat the crap out of each other.  They doke it out.  You know?  Like men.  They act like men for a few minutes.  You can't even upset women, because if women say you hit them, you're done.  What?  You know, you can't even, women, if women say you hit them, you have no recourse.  No.  It's just, you know what I mean?  You can't.  No, I know.  And I don't.  No.  But I'll pay to have it done.  Yeah.  My mother used to hit us with a wooden spoon.  My mother's like, you know.  That's what kids today, people don't hit the kids, and they're acting crazy. 
[01:31:00]  I'm telling you, man.  I'm telling you.  Beat your children.  Beat them every chance you get, because if you don't, when you're in a wheelchair, they're going  to be burning you with cigarettes.  And you go, why are you doing this?  Because you never beat me.  You never showed me the love.  Your grandparent showed you.  My father would beat me for practice.  He would say, ah, give me something heavy, you know, and bring it over.  Don't make me get up.  I'll beat you during a commercial.  Oh, and they make you get the beating implement.  I used to have to get my own stick.  How degrading is that?  You had it coming.  I didn't hit my own kids. 
[01:31:30]  No.  Jack's, you know, 6'5".  I mean, psychologically, I still have the advantage, but I mean, he's a big kid.  Yeah.  But I have two kids.  I'm not comfortable with my kids.  Something tells me you can throw a pretty good beating just talking to people, though.  Yeah, I can.  Like, you could pretty much nail a kid or screw them right into the ground just talking.  I got to say this.  My kid's really funny.  Yeah, he is.  He says, he's driving now.  See, the other day, I'm in the car with him, his mother and his sister in the back seat.  And I'm riding shotgun.  And he's got his learner's permit.  He's a good driver.  He's been driving for years, you know, illegally. 
[01:32:00]  So he's driving along, and his mother says something.  He turns, and he looks into the back seat.  And I go, what are you doing?  He goes, what?  I said, you can't look.  You've got to, your eyes stay on the road, and you go to your central mirror and your two sides, and that's it.  Maybe the radio station, but now that's on the steering wheel.  You don't look at anybody when they're talking to you.  Get in the habit.  And he goes, all right, all right.  And for the next, you know, four or five miles, he starts doing this.  Like, just to piss me off.  And then he does this.  He goes like this. 
[01:32:30]  Like that.  And I can't say it, because his mother doesn't know what he's doing.  Just the side glance at you.  Side glance to piss me off.  To piss you off.  Newsflash.  Newsflash.  Katie Couric, you know, the news person of the world.  What if you had no period?  Hey, this is good.  Turn it up.  That would make writing letters almost impossible.  What if you had no period?  This is a woman who's going to do the CBS Evening News.  This is the news.  To take over for Walter Cronkite.  People all over the world are getting ready to bomb us and kill us, and our headline on the news is, what if you had no period? 
[01:33:00]  I don't have a period.  She looks like Sally Jesse Raphael with those glasses.  You know, right now, this will make me look important.  Give me glasses.  Stock in white, bearskin rugs is going through the roof.  You know, I get to meet Walter Cronkite.  Hey, I talked to Ferraro.  You guys talked to him lately?  Oh, Adam?  Yeah.  I called him.  I haven't heard from him.  He's kaputnik with the relationship.  Yeah, I heard about that.  What?  Yep.  That's breaking news, really?  He was going out with that girlfriend.  He is.  He sounded like a happy man, but a slightly broken happy man.  Yeah.  He's been on the road. 
[01:33:30]  He's got no place to live here.  I talked to him, and I'm like, you bought that place.  I know.  What happened?  Oh, well, we have an arrangement where, and I don't want to get into too many details,  but this isn't any surprise to any guy that's broken up or had a relationship go sour.  You wind up out on your ass with the girl in the place.  And I'm like, Adam.  With the place done over, with the furniture that was bought to fill in the done over place.  Thank God for cable TV.  She got everything.  Get it back.  I go, get back in here.  Get back in there and fight. 
[01:34:00]  Well, you've got an arrangement in September.  I'm going to do this.  I wanted to reach through the phone and choke him.  Well, what can you do?  You've got to love him.  He's a nice girl.  This is what you do.  You know, they had a good thing going.  I don't know why it blew up, but it blew up, and, you know, now he's like you.  He's living in a place with a couch and a cooler.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You can get in touch with yourself, whatever you feel like.  And no one can say anything.  Throw away all materialistic things.  Is that it?  Cleansing of the spirit?  Live like a spot for a while.  Yeah, that's all. 
[01:34:30]  See what it's all about.  Then you have tapes of people yelling at you, just in case you get lonely.  Yeah, yeah.  Get out of the car!  Answer the receipt.  Do something!  Pick up the phone, you idiot, if you still have one.  We've got to get Adam on the show now.  Yeah, I know.  He's in Tampa.  He's with Phil Esposito and Espo's wife, and he was doing a gig in some comedy club in  Tampa.  I mean, he sounded fine, but...  Because he's probably getting laid like crazy now.  Let's not talk about that, because, you know, that could get him in trouble.  Well, I'm just saying probably.  I'm saying probably. 
[01:35:00]  Probably.  I haven't talked to him.  I just know by going to gigs...  You mean in the gay world.  He's getting laid in the gay world.  Not women.  That's it.  He's rebounding with men.  I forgot to out him.  That's the mistake I made.  Yeah, oops.  I just know when I went down to Governor's or whatever to see Adam, I'd get like three  big fat guys coming up to me, love your show, dude, love your show.  Adam's holding court at the bar with a harem.  A harem.  The chicks always...  They love Adam.  You know what?  He has a boyish Tony Danza charm that makes me physically ill. 
[01:35:30]  I don't think it's Tony Danza charm.  Oh, they love him.  No, it's just that...  He's a small guy who can tap dance and sing charm.  Now, the new Tony.  Adam's more like, I'm a sarcastic guy, but also, you know, I'm kind of suave.  He's kind of charming.  Tony Danza in Taxi when he was, like, lovable and just like, you know, the guy had the little  bobbing hair.  They all loved him.  He was cute and handsome.  Not the old one, though.  I'm going to sing some Sinatra songs for you on my show.  That guy could box.  He certainly can't host a show.  He might as well...  That's why I'm getting terrific ratings. 
[01:36:00]  I'm going to sing Torch songs on my show.  You might remember me from Taxi.  That guy's dead.  He's gone, and I'm just singing Torch songs.  What's the matter?  He's finding something.  What the hell happened to Tony Danza?  E-Rock, what are you trying to find?  Snipers.  Snipers.  Snipers on the roof.  Snipers.  Lower the shields.  Ninjas.  Ninja snipers.  They rappel down and smash through, and Howard says, I told you, Tom, I told you never 
[01:36:30]  to put a window in here.  Now I'm dead, and Robin's in the bulletproof glass.  I got an instant feedback before we take a break for Dennis Leary.  Johnny Cakes from New Hampshire.  Johnny Cakes.  Somebody tell Leary that hockey sucks, and it's a dying sport.  More people watch curling compared to hockey.  I'm sick of him trying to make hockey a real sport.  Let me tell you something, Tom.  I'm not going to make hockey a real sport.  It is a real sport.  It's the toughest sport out there.  And I'll tell you what.  Why don't you come to the Open Anthony Show, and we'll bring in Cam Neely and LB, and we'll 
[01:37:00]  have a discussion about what's tough and what's not tough.  And I don't give a shit about who watches.  I watch.  He's an animal.  Obviously someone who got cut from a Little League team.  Yeah.  Can I say blow me?  Probably.  Come on.  I don't think so.  A blow job on the Leno show.  That ain't going to work.  Did they let it go through?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  In about 20 minutes, we'll get in there.  I'm sick of being told that I can't say certain things.  I love Leno.  By the way, this will be a record-setting dump report today as we announce everything that  was dumped on XM.  We go to XM and get the dump sheet from here, and we can read it verbatim. 
[01:37:30]  No.  Wait.  I don't.  What happened?  We're running out of the way.  Ben, he came running in here before going, dude, we got like two seconds left.  That's it.  What does that mean?  And then they just turn the key, and we're off the air for a while.  No, we don't want that.  A song.  No, no, we don't want that.  They'll go to a song, so they have to build up the leg.  Don't we get a grace period, because this is our first time back on the show?  Yeah, I say they do.  Oh, I'm sure the Federal Communications Commission gives out grace periods as they're increasing  fine totals and everything else. 
[01:38:00]  This is, what's his name,'s kid, right?  That's running the FCC now.  Powell?  Powell's kid?  No, he used to.  He's out.  He stepped down, right?  Yeah, now a guy named Kevin Martin.  Yeah, why don't we take a break?  This is what's going to happen.  We're going to do a clean show for another 20 minutes, then we're going to get really  dirty at XM.  You guys are going to do the walk today, right?  It starts at the walk.  We broadcast the walk on XM, by the way, too.  So the filthy language starts the second we hit the concrete.  Oh, that's great.  Down the sidewalk, we carried, we were carrying Lord Stanley's cup down the, yeah, we had 
[01:38:30]  it right here.  We had the Stanley Cup in.  We had a bullshit sport called hockey, so there it goes again.  I'm sorry.  You're not allowed to say hockey.  Hockey's a dirty word.  Hey, man, I'm with Dennis.  I think this is funny that he just curves like crazy.  We had the Stanley Cup in here, and then we were able to walk it to XM.  It was really cool.  Have either one of you guys gotten married or anything since the last time?  Not since the last time, no.  Forget you.  No, but I'm done with marriage.  I did it once.  It's over, Johnny.  I love my girlfriend. 
[01:39:00]  No, why don't punch him?  I can't say that.  I swear to God.  Ask these guys.  I've never been happier in my life.  How long you been with him?  It'll pass.  We're up to.  It'll pass.  We're up to.  It's talking about like a kidney stone.  Look at Lenny.  It'll pass.  A lot of pain, but then it's over.  Two years.  Two years is over.  Two years.  I like it.  I'm going to go to four.  That's when the trouble is going to happen.  That's not even a married argument.  Two years.  She's young, right?  She's young.  How old?  Fifteen.  Fifteen.  How old she will be? 
[01:39:30]  She's in her twenties?  Yeah.  In her twenties.  That's going to work.  Just, huh?  That's going to work.  Yeah.  All right.  What did you learn in school?  Maybe they're mad.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'll wait.  Two more years, I'll wait.  Two more years, you'll wait?  All right.  Hey, did you guys see the Madonna picture?  Where was that?  All right.  Here's the thing with Madonna.  I don't know about you guys.  No one cares about this one, by the way.  Okay.  I didn't even know about it.  I'm just going to say this.  I thought she was a highly attractive woman when she did Desperately Seeking Susan.  I know it's 20 years ago.  She's the same age as me.  All right?  And I got to tell her, there's a message from Madonna. 
[01:40:00]  All right?  You know what?  When your arms are more defined than mine, I'm not having sex with you.  I don't care what woman it is, but specifically her.  I look at her, I go, you know what?  You got better arms than me.  Suck a punch, you can go down.  Yeah.  Suck a punch, you can go down.  Stop working out.  You know what I mean?  Put a little weight back on.  Let the arms go a little bit, you know?  I've taken her out of my spank bank.  She's gone.  She's destroyed her husband, Guy Ritchie.  One of the greatest directors of his generation.  Snatched.  One of the greatest models.  His talent has been sucked out of his penis.  There's nothing left.  His last, did you see the last movie he made about Kabbalah or whatever the hell it was 
[01:40:30]  about?  No, no one did.  I was up for that.  I was up for the Kabbalah movie.  She's taken his balls and put them in a pickle jar.  I can say that, right?  Oh, wow.  I'm just looking at the time going home.  And his baseballs that were in the garage.  There you go.  He's done all the sports equipment and put it in a pickle jar.  That's right.  That'll work.  This is ridiculous.  This is a joke, you know?  Well, what is this symbol?  Look at this and laugh.  We're trying to figure out what this symbolizes.  Her crucified, like she's Jesus.  No, but yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Wow, what a tough life she has.  Yeah, because she's the Madonna.  Madonna, she's the mother of God, I guess, right?  It ain't washing with me.  I'm not.  Let's call Guy Ritchie.  Let's get him on.  He doesn't have a phone.  She won't let him have a phone.  He's locked up in the basement with the kids.  Mommy will be home in about five weeks.  We were commenting, or Jimmy was saying that she's so brave to do that, yet she will never,  ever mock the Muslim religion on stage like that.  Yeah, there you go.  Now you're talking.  None of these Hollywood faggots talking about Islam.  They trash.  If you're going to be dangerous.  Hey, I am a Muslim, just so we get that straight, all right? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, well, we knew that.  Yeah, I'm not practicing that.  You really look the part, too.  If there's some plastic, you know, a person to go around, I'd like to have it, just to  save for later on, you know?  They try to be dangerous by attacking Catholicism.  If you're going to go after religion, at least show some type of moral courage and go after  the one that's been causing a bit of a ruckus lately.  Some diversity.  Have some diversity in your...  Well, I disagree with you, Jim, because I think the mob is dead, okay?  The Irish mob is dead.  The Italian mob is dead.  The only mob left is the Catholic Church, and these guys have got it up. 
[01:42:00]  This is the greatest organization in the history of criminal behavior on the planet.  They have more real estate than anybody else.  They'll bang your kids and pay you off.  I mean, they'll do anything.  And then, they'll listen to your secrets.  Charles Durning, from Charles Durning's mouth, I was with him and Lenny, we were sitting  in the dressing room, getting ready to shoot a scene from Rescue Me, the day that they  sent the smoke up from the Catholic Church bong that they used to announce the new pope.  New pope, yeah.  And he said, out loud, before the guy, his name was announced, they opened the doors 
[01:42:30]  and he walked out and he goes, this guy was with the Nazis.  The Nazi youth.  He was in front of a Mercedes-Benz factory in Berlin when they marched into Berlin.  And that's what he actually said.  Now, his version was, I quit the army, which I was forced to be in because I was German,  and I protected the Mercedes-Benz factory because I knew the Americans.  And the value of a good car.  This guy is a scumbag.  Okay.  You're right.  Catholicism.  The whole church, by the way, in my mind, is... 
[01:43:00]  Understandable.  But they're not lopping off heads actively.  And having a silent reaction by the rest of the religion.  I'd rather have my kid's head lopped off than if he was abused by a priest and had to  live with that for the rest of his life.  No, you wouldn't.  Yes, I would.  You know the damage this does to these people?  You know what the lopping off head does?  These priests bang and then they pay them off.  These kids, their lives are over.  It's safe to attack the Catholic church.  I'm not saying the church is good.  They should be attacked.  The church is bad.  The church is the most evil organization on this planet.  It's easy to attack them.  Islam is never attacked by people in show business because they're terrified of Islam. 
[01:43:30]  Do you imagine...  I'm not terrified of Islam.  I'm telling you right now.  I'm saying in general...  I'm talking a lot of Scientology.  The New York Times would die.  That frightens me.  And by the way, Catholicism, yeah, they protest the Da Vinci Code.  If it was a movie about Islam, they would have murdered the people that made it like they  did Van Gogh in Denmark for making an unpopular play.  So they go out and murder you.  What I'm saying is Islam is practicing barbarism and no one in Hollywood is talking about that.  They're going to kill you.  Who invented barbarism?  The Catholic church.  They didn't invent it.  They've been a part of it.  They're a part of it. 
[01:44:00]  But they didn't invent it.  And not in the last couple of hundred years.  Islam is the one who's been piping up lately.  I'm just saying, if you're going to be a maverick and you're after religion...  Are you saying if we had a boxing match between the Catholic church and Islam, Islam's going  to win?  Oh, no.  I'd have to go with the church.  I'd go with the church.  I'd go with the church, too.  The church would have been beating people from Jesus.  I'd go with the church, too.  What I'm saying is...  Go ahead.  Take care of your problems.  This pseudo-dangerous nonsense that entertainers do, it's like nothing wrong with attacking  the church.  I'm all for it.  But they will never balance it and go after Islam.  Right.  And she's in the Kabbalah, which is supposed to take place in Israel. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know, but it's something Jewish.  Her name's Esther, and she won't go after Islam, and all they want to do is end Israel.  Why are you so, you know...  I can't...  I've got to watch my language.  I had so much coffee.  Why are you so...  Can I say pissed off?  Yeah.  Why are you so pissed off about Islam?  Because you're getting a free pass.  Why am I so mad about...  I don't know.  What religion are you?  I raised Irish Catholic, but I also...  Same as me.  You don't believe in anything.  I also find them to be repulsive in a lot of their behavior.  Why am I so mad about Islam?  Who's repulsive?  I said I also find them to be repulsive... 
[01:45:00]  Who?  Who's them?  The church and Catholicism.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, yeah.  But why am I pissed off at Islam?  Gee, I don't know.  I can think of 19 fellows a couple of years ago.  I can think of one who's on trial.  No, no, no.  Killy Morrow.  That's obvious.  I'm just saying just more.  And the silence...  And the silence...  And not all Muslims, but the silence of a lot of Muslims.  Whenever there's an abortion bombing, right?  Abortion clinic bombing.  Catholics speak out about it.  They crap out.  Yeah, yeah.  But when you hear about something like that, there's this really weird silence by a lot  of Muslims.  Maybe they're afraid.  Maybe they're not.  But I'm tired of this fear. 
[01:45:30]  Well, maybe.  Maybe it's racism.  Maybe we're just...  You and I and the other men in this room are racist against Barry Bonds and Islam.  Maybe it's a racist thing.  Is Barry Bonds Islamic?  Wow, is he?  Hey, what do you think about Barry Bonds with the home run?  He hit it with his head.  It shouldn't count.  He hit it with his head.  He hit it with his head.  Babe Ruth did it drunk and fat.  And by the way, Barry Bonds and a guy who's a friend of mine, Danny Glover and Jesse Jackson  want to claim this is a racism thing.  Where's Hank Aaron?  Call Hank Aaron.  Get Hank Aaron on the phone and have him tell me, along with you, that it's racist. 
[01:46:00]  When that guy...  I was a teenager.  I saw that guy when they were death threats and the N-word was on every other poster.  Give me a break.  They hear the same thing to Roger Maris when they thought he was...  He's an arrogant son of a bitch, and it's not true.  And there's not going to be an asterisk.  There's going to be a giant pimple.  A steroid-infested pimple next to his name in the record books.  Why doesn't baseball just admit...  If you're going to put an asterisk next to him, there's so many years they should have  an asterisk next to so many different people.  I love baseball, but I'm going to give it the giant middle finger for not pulling him 
[01:46:30]  over to the side of the road and saying, take off the uniform and get out before you  break Babe Ruth's record.  And he said it two years ago at the All-Star Game.  When I break Babe Ruth's record, you can bury that white boy forever.  That's what he said.  He's denying you said it now.  I'll tell you what.  Now you broke the record, take off your elbow pads and your ankle pads and get a glove  and go to the mound and pitch for four years and be a 20-game winner, which Babe Ruth did  at the start of his career.  That's still home.  That's still home.  You scumbag.  You brought it up, not us.  It's not racism.  I have nothing to do with what color you are. 
[01:47:00]  It's the size of your head.  You steroid infected.  And he did it all with throat cancer.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  While womanizing and smoking.  Yeah, and eating hot dogs.  Eating hot dogs are dead.  Right.  Yeah.  The Bambino.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on the virus, Sirius XM.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Relight the birthday cake, E-Rock.  Is that an ugly fucking statue?  Relight the birthday cake.  We're in the lobby of Free FM here in New York City with Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark. 
[01:47:30]  This is the filthy show now, right?  Yeah, now you say whatever the fuck you want.  Oh, cunt, cunt, cunt.  Yeah, but look at that shot cut over there.  That's that cut statue.  That statue is the worst statue I've ever seen.  And you know, it probably goes for millions.  Oh, sure.  Lenny, did you model for that statue back on the day?  Yes, I did at one point.  It's got to slip.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Well, I put a tape.  You did a Silence of the Lambs?  You're tucked.  You too can have a cut.  All right, we got lots of people out here. 
[01:48:00]  They're going to do the walk with us to XM.  Some people snapping.  Happy birthday, Opie signs.  Stalker Patty's holding my birthday cake.  Patty's got the cake.  Patty, why don't you eat a little of that, you twig?  Oh, God.  Come here.  Stalker Patty, come here.  It's not good.  I have health problems.  Patty is a 51-year-old virgin.  Hey, good for her.  And she's holding, waiting for the right guy.  Really?  No shit.  Has she met Jim yet?  She ain't coming, sweetheart.  Yeah.  Patty.  There was a guy with a 31-year-old in there who was looking for you. 
[01:48:30]  And she's going through menopause right now.  I want to watch your back.  So she wasted everything.  She wasted her entire moist years, as we like to call them.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  Want to say hi to Dennis?  There is no right guy.  Go out and get laid, because there is no right guy.  Believe me.  Even if a guy convinces you he's the right guy, he's lying.  All right?  Bang him.  Him.  Anybody.  Okay.  Today.  The world could end tomorrow.  What are you doing?  You have a vagina.  You know how valuable it is? 
[01:49:00]  She's 51.  Fuck somebody, for Christ's sake.  She's 51.  Get off the bench.  You get in the game.  You got to get laid, sister.  And she's going through menopause now, we learned.  See?  Yeah.  You know.  Menopause is no menopause.  I don't care.  She left the Ferrari in the garage for the entire lifespan of her vagina.  You wasted it.  Now your ovaries are like...  How do you know you're not a lesbian?  I'm not.  Well, you don't know.  You haven't fucked a guy.  Right?  What's your excuse? 
[01:49:30]  Come on now.  Lenny.  Fuck her.  Go fuck her.  Come on, Lenny.  Take one for the team.  Yeah, you're all about charity.  Come on.  Are we ready to walk?  Jimmy has joined us.  Where were you, Jimmy?  I was upstairs.  You guys don't have like a fucking limo or something?  No, it's a physical walk.  It's a fucking...  It's a block and a half.  It's an AIDS walk.  It's a fucking...  Have you seen our audience?  It is.  I don't walk anywhere.  Is Al Sharpton going to join us?  He hasn't missed a walk in 30 years.  Al Sharpton's on Rescue Me this year, playing himself. 
[01:50:00]  Is he?  Is he walking?  He's playing...  I bet he's angry about something.  He's playing a reverse racist preacher.  I love him.  Jesus.  No, we walk and just make fun of people.  Yeah, now we talk, we make fun of people.  Okay.  Yeah, let's take it on the road here.  The mail.  Hey, look.  Cake, luggage.  You're welcome.  There you go.  Yeah, handing out the Rescue Me CDs.  What's crazy Patty?  Give her one of those.  Yeah, stalker Patty.  She could maybe roll it into a dildo or some shit. 
[01:50:30]  I don't fucking believe that.  51 years old, never been touched.  But we actually had a couple of years back, we put tickets to U2, because she loves U2,  down Ron Jeremy's pants, and she had to reach down, grab his cock, and take the tickets  out.  No wonder she's not fucking men.  Yeah, her hand has AIDS.  Wow, we got quite a scene today for the walk.  Yeah.  The paparazzi. 
[01:51:00]  This is our favorite bus driver.  Well, no, not that one.  He doesn't like us.  Here's one of us.  Hey, there.  Oh, look at that getting off the bus.  Very nice, Dennis.  She seemed to have had something for you there.  I think I've had too much coffee.  I don't know.  And then other people just walk around.  They're going play.  It's New York.  You see this nowhere else.  Look at this guy.  Look at this guy.  Nice tie.  How you doing?  Oh, we fell right into it.  This is exactly what we do all day. 
[01:51:30]  It's going to rain.  Good thing you wore that jacket.  Where's your tie?  You don't have a tie on.  Hey, sweetheart.  How are you?  Ma.  Ma.  How you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  You want to be on the radio?  I've never been on the radio, no.  I'm going to be on the radio right now.  Well, thank you.  Good morning.  Sheila Hingarani.  Hi, Sheila.  Sheila?  Hi, Sheila.  I'm Dennis.  This is Lenny.  Hi, Sheila.  Nice to meet you.  You want to rescue me?  You don't want to rescue me?  I don't know what show that is.  It's with Dennis Leary. 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  Oh.  What do you watch?  Well, I've now moved to San Francisco, so I've been in San Francisco for the last year.  They don't have to rescue me in San Francisco?  No television there?  In a world, it's locked up.  She looks like Wafa Bin Laden.  I'm on and he's on.  So what do you watch?  I'm a boring person.  I usually watch the Business News and the Discovery Channel.  Oh.  Say that again.  Wow.  Not yet.  Not yet?  Get off the Business News.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yes, I do.  Where is he?  In San Francisco.  Is he gay?  Uh-oh.  No, he's straight.  Yeah, are you sure?  He's the guy.  Very, very straight.  Is he going to start shopping?  You know what he does.  Okay, okay.  He's a fan.  Does he notice your shoes?  Look at the bus.  Look at the bus.  Right there.  There's the show.  Hey, there it is.  Yeah.  The show's on the side of the bus.  See that guy?  On fire?  That's him.  The man is burning.  That's the soundtrack.  There you go.  Tell your boyfriend he's a very nice guy.  For a fag.  Call him right now.  I'm sure he's blowing another guy.  You need to check on that. 
[01:53:00]  I'll make sure he...  If he's in San Francisco by himself right now, you're in trouble.  Hey, nice to meet you.  All right.  Goodbye, you boring boy.  Yeah, it's right now.  I like how Jimmy commented.  She looked like Bin Laden's sister-in-law.  Oh, Mac is here.  Thistler's got to be Mac.  Who's Mac?  Oh, Mac.  We've got to give him some cash today.  Who's Mac?  It's our homeless friend.  Where is it?  He's on the corner on the other side of the road.  Hey, meal ticket.  Can you back up so you don't get hurt?  Run over.  It's your birthday.  Don't get run over, you son of a bitch.  Yeah.  He gets run over. 
[01:53:30]  My whole schedule gets thrown off for retirement.  Bastard.  I love when he says he's going skiing.  Break your neck.  Yeah.  Do you think skiing?  He skis, yeah.  Me, not so much.  I don't like the cold.  I like the cold.  I just don't like to ski.  I ski.  All right.  Here we go.  I throw them on.  I go right down that mountain.  I've got some of the boys up there.  I see one of the fire trucks up there.  Another terrorist right there.  He touched your hand.  You probably got something on your hand now. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, shit.  43.  123.  There he is.  I don't know.  Dennis is talking to a fireman.  What's going on, gentlemen?  Just checking the hydrant.  Just checking the hydrant?  Make sure it works.  What do you need?  You like Dennis' show?  Yeah, rest of you, me.  It's a good show.  Accurate portrayal of the fire department?  Some so. 
[01:54:30]  Some so.  The good parts, where it makes you guys look good.  The broads love you guys, though, right?  Yeah, he can say that.  You can.  I see it.  You guys are, like, sitting out the side of the truck on a call.  The girls are all, like, creaming over you guys.  It's the uniform.  Does it?  Work for you?  You're single, married, what?  Single.  Single?  So you get a lot of pussy, right?  I'm a young guy.  I'm only 23, so...  Well, you can still get a lot of pussy at 23.  All right, Kyle.  See you later.  How's that hydrant?  It's not working. 
[01:55:00]  Is there going to be water coming out of it?  No.  Do we need any black children to be, uh...  Anthony?  Anthony, someone has to...  You don't want to go wet.  Someone has to poke Mac to see if he's living.  Mac!  Mac!  Mac!  You all right?  You all right, bro?  How you doing, man?  Ladies and gentlemen, a true Yankees fan.  Well, he had a goddamn Boston hat on when we first saw him.  We're like, no one's giving you fucking money with a Boston hat on sitting there.  So he gave him the Yankee hat and had him throw away the Boston hat. 
[01:55:30]  Oh!  Okay.  Because, come on.  Guys, it's New York.  Mac, what team do you really like?  New York.  Yeah?  You're a lying son of a bitch, Mac.  No, I might be...  But you're homeless, so, you know, we'll be nice to you.  You know who that is?  No.  Dennis Leary?  The Green Goblin?  Spider-Man?  No.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did you watch Rescue Me?  No, he'd be in a suit.  He'd be in a suit.  I know.  I'm thinking maybe he could watch TV.  What are you giving him?  10 bucks?  You son of a bitch.  With the contract, you just got...  Come on.  You should be giving him... 
[01:56:00]  That's all I got.  No, give him the grand.  Go ahead.  You got a lot.  You want me to give him a grand?  Yeah.  Come on.  How about Opie?  Fess off.  Give him some money.  I'll put the pressure on.  Jimmy, where are you?  Give him some of your weed.  Come on.  Oh, he's got to outdo me with a 20.  And Norton says he'll reach the 20.  He raises 100.  Jimmy's giving...  And keeping with the way the contracts are, you get a dollar from me.  We're working on it, Jimmy.  Mac, do you mind showing Dennis Leary your leg? 
[01:56:30]  You got to show the leg.  It's really a tourist attraction here in Manhattan.  Just one time.  You got to get this fixed, bro.  What the hell is this?  It's bad.  All the way up.  All the way up.  Warm.  All the way up.  All the way up.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to...  Why don't you just get this guy to a hospital?  They might put him on a radio show.  We've been telling him, get the hell to a hospital.  What am I telling him?  Have somebody pick him up and take him.  The legs might stay if you pick him up.  I don't know.  He needs an ambulance to come and pick him up.  You play a fireman.  Do something.  You can either have these guys take him to the hospital and get it looked at,  or just turn it into a bong and get it over with. 
[01:57:00]  You know what I mean?  I don't want that.  Table legs.  We were supposed to have a doctor do the walk with us to try to figure out what this was.  Yeah, one of these days is going to check it out and diagnose it right here on the street corner.  Yeah, I put that at the top of the to-do list over there.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  No, yeah, Dennis Leary.  This guy's over here watching his leg rot off.  You got to get that fixed.  Why haven't you been to the hospital?  We give you money for maybe take a cab over there.  You know, it's free for you.  Poe, give him a treat today.  Give him a little treat. 
[01:57:30]  What's he got?  Not the cookie.  Not the cookie.  Why not?  The cookie's good.  I want the cookie.  Jesus Christ.  Well, give him a slice of cake.  You got plenty of cake.  Give him a cookie, you cheap fuck.  You can't fucking walk and you won't give him the cookie.  Dang it.  Jesus.  All right, Mac.  We'll see you at the time soon.  All right, Mac.  Go to the goddamn hospital.  Say hello to the po-po over there.  Po-po.  There we go.  Hi, boys.  Officers.  How you doing, guys?  You want to say hi to Dennis Leary?  All right, they're waving hi. 
[01:58:00]  There's Dennis, the NYPD, a couple of the boys.  All right, we're moving on to XM.  Straight up.  That fucking leg, man.  That fucking leg.  Oh, I know.  We tell him to go to the hospital.  How did you see the leg to begin with?  Was he in shorts?  You know, that's a good question.  How the hell did we see that?  Yeah, that's how they are.  I'm going to bet the under on that.  Look, Dennis, a prop. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  You guys, uh...  They doing a photo?  Yeah, E-Rock.  I was like, crazy horse on the second in the Falcon.  He's a poem.  Oh, shit.  Where's the mission here?  Where'd it go?  Right here.  Oh, okay.  Who's in this photo?  That's the only guarantee.  Take a picture.  All right.  Dennis taking a...  Back up again, Eric.  I'm going to bite you next. 
[01:59:00]  FDNY is hanging out in front of the building.  Testing out some hydrants.  I guess what they're doing today.  They're not testing out hydrants.  They wanted to meet Dennis.  You think that's it?  Of course it is.  Testing out hydrants.  Oh, now look at this.  See?  There's girls coming in now.  These firemen got it knocked.  Knocked.  They love them.  All right.  Moving on.  The girls love the firemen. 
[01:59:30]  Moving on.  Lots of cops in the area today.  All right.  They're talking to...  All right.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Need your mic, sweetie?  That don't matter.  There we go.  We continue up the sidewalk.  Oh, you got a mic.  I got a mic.  Don't worry about me.  Mic's for everybody.  It's so nice to be able to walk by cops without having to run.  Lenny Clark. 
[02:00:00]  I've never seen so many cops and firemen on this walk.  Let's go.  All Irish.  We're always the exact part of our entourage.  Is that it now?  Cops, firemen, and hookers.  Right, Lenny?  That's right.  Not in that order.  Not in that order.  All right.  Back in.  We'll be upstairs.  Hey, we're doing our show in a couple of minutes.  So stick with us.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah, let's touch the floor. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  I've never touched that like me.  There you go.  You sit there.  You sit right there.  You sit right there.  But now it's just, yeah.  We've got it to the point where we just don't care.  Hi, everybody.  Hello, XM radio audience.  Yes.  Hi.  We are here with Lenny Clark.  Yes, and I'm glad to be here.  I'm glad to be away from that leg.  It scares me.  Yeah, that leg scares the shit out of everybody.  I'm going to take better care of myself starting now.  It looks like what you would get if you took a safari in Africa like 1909. 
[02:01:00]  Right.  And shot a rhinoceros, cut his legs off, and made table legs out of it.  That's it.  That's what it looks like.  He's got the scales.  It's almost like a hoof-like thing.  Right.  If it wasn't for the pussy bandage around it, which really scares me.  Now, what you ought to do for your next contest, you know, why can somebody touch it  to win tickets?  Just touch it.  Just touch it.  That's bad enough.  Because most people would say, lick it.  Oh, now you're...  Oh, I'm going to get off my bite stuff.  Oh, it tastes like the banana cream pie filling. 
[02:01:30]  Only different.  What's that, Christina Aguilera?  Get out of the car.  Paris Hilton.  Yeah, that's our wall of fame.  Yeah.  It keeps getting less and less...  Is that Lindsay Lohan?  No.  Britney Spears?  Britney?  Maybe.  Are her tits real?  Yeah, I don't know.  Who cares?  How fat is Paris Hilton's pussy?  She has a nice fat puss.  Really nice one.  Sorry.  It's attached to her head.  When a cock is going in and out of it 24 hours a day, it might get swollen. 
[02:02:00]  A little puffy.  You don't like thin broads like that?  No, I'm married to a tall, thin girl.  I love tall, thin girls.  But that head, and the shit comes out of that head?  A helmet is a very important thing for me.  It's the shit that goes into it that's important.  First of all, she doesn't know how to fuck, because we've seen the video.  I have to have a girl who's smart and funny and fucking beautiful.  I'm very picky.  Yeah, very.  I just need a chick who's under 300 pounds with a fat pussy.  That's all I require.  See, Jim, that's why you could probably do better than I am. 
[02:02:30]  You've got to have goals.  You lower those percentiles.  I'm a much happier guy.  The numbers go up.  Who wants smoothies?  I want immediate ice latte with soy.  No, I can't have it.  Last time I had a smoothie for breakfast.  Smoothie?  Wow.  That really cleans you out.  I don't need a smoothie today.  You want some cake?  I think we're going to have cake.  I don't need cake.  But then again, did XM get me a cake for my birthday?  I don't think they did.  Oh, boy.  CBS got me a cake for my birthday?  And they got me tickets to the Mets-Phillies game this Thursday. 
[02:03:00]  We're playing the divorced parents gig with XM and CBS.  Now, CBS got Opie a birthday cake and tickets to the Mets game.  Okay.  And now he's waiting to see what Mommy gets.  Now I'm just waiting to see what XM's going to get me for my birthday.  What is Mommy going to get me?  Daddy got me this.  Now what does Mommy get me?  I say I get nothing.  41.  41?  41.  You beat the under.  Yeah.  You're doing good.  You did.  A lot of people said the way you guys were.  You'd never make it to the point.  What did your girlfriend get you?  I'll find out in about an hour and a half. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, really?  There's some life you guys have.  You get up at what?  4 o'clock in the morning.  4.15.  That's the worst.  And you're done by what?  10.30?  4.15, you go to work, and you're done by...  No, you have to go to 12 now, right?  Right?  Do you work for 12?  Well, technically, but we can play a lot of tapes.  Today, I don't care what anyone else does.  I'm out of here at 10.55.  Okay.  I'm right with you.  So, 11 o'clock, you're done with work.  Today, because it's my birthday.  Last day I didn't even work on my birthday.  Don't try to change the subject.  Then, the 20-something-year-old girlfriend, what does she do for a living? 
[02:04:00]  She's looking around right now.  Yeah, she's looking around.  She's living off his salary.  Okay, so then you meet up with her.  You bang her, or she blows you, right?  And then, what?  You fucking hang around and watch giant plasma TV in your fucking big, rich apartment, right?  And then, you probably get blown or fucked again.  And then, you go to bed at like 10, so you can get up at 4 and do this.  Fuck, you got the life, man.  You definitely have prostate cancer in your future.  I'm telling you right now.  Have that fucking thing checked.  Get that seed put up your ass, because something's going to happen.  David Lee Roth is home listening to this. 
[02:04:30]  He's at home listening to his old fucking Van Halen tapes going, what was I thinking?  Well, first of all...  What's this?  First of all, hold on.  We'll get to this in a second, but what do you guys think of the walkover, first of  all?  I thought it was fantastic.  Isn't that cool?  We get to do that every day.  It's my favorite thing I've ever done in radio.  We get to do that every day.  And every day, it's different.  Sometimes we have...  Hey, cock knock.  Sometimes we get big celebrities like yourselves and other days.  It's just us.  That was a nice walk, though.  You had a good crowd of people.  Isn't that nice?  It must suck when you're fucking in the middle of a snowstorm or something.  Well, it was raining last week, and no one followed us, so we were out there with umbrellas. 
[02:05:00]  In the winter, let me tell you, that walk thing ain't going to fucking happen.  So what is this?  This is like fucking school all over again.  It has the dirty words, and then the name of the guy who said it next to it.  Like, we go to court.  Lenny, you said pussy.  Dennis, you said tits.  Dennis is one of the favorite parts of the show for some people.  People love it.  And we even have a sounder for it.  Yeah.  Shit.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let Anthony get into it.  It's really good.  Go, go.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  And here are your dumps for this Tuesday, 5-23-06. 
[02:05:30]  It started at 6.40 a.m. with Jim Norton saying, fuck.  He might have swallowed the K, but at this point it was academic.  He said, fuck.  He got right up to the C.  And believe it or not, when you say fuck, F-U-C, it's pretty much the same word.  The K is implied.  The K, yeah.  6.47, shit from a caller.  6.47, fucking from the same caller who didn't know what the fuck to do on the radio. 
[02:06:00]  8.04, you can't say fuck.  Hey, we won an hour and 15 minutes.  Wow.  We were doing well there for a while until someone arrived into the studio.  8.04.  Opie said, you can't say fuck.  Now, how did the first dump, was you saying you can't say fuck?  I know.  Who said fuck?  Because I asked him, I said, can I say fuck?  What words can we say?  Yeah, maybe that's what it was.  And Opie said, you can't say fuck.  I was just trying to help out my friend Dennis Leary.  8.04, Dennis Leary.  By the way, my name is spelt wrong, okay?  Oh, it is.  There's only one name. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Assholes.  Just remember the word penis and then put a fucking D on the front.  You can't say penis on that show, but we'll get to that.  Okay.  Tit, which the lightest of the words that you used the entire time at 8.04.  Dennis Leary at 8.04 was on a roll.  Wow, look at all that 8.04.  Let's just acknowledge 8.04 as a fine time to be listening to the first half of the show.  8.04, Cockknocker, Lenny Clark.  Yeah.  Which I want to contest.  You want to contest the Cockknocker?  I think we should contest.  Is this radio show under protest?  Yeah.  Well, not this one, but that last fucking show where you can't even talk about tits or Cockknocker. 
[02:07:00]  What is a Cockknocker?  Who even knows what the fuck a Cockknocker is?  That's right.  So you look up at a tits.  You know what, Lenny?  I always thought, ever since you invented the word Cockknocker, which is back in the late  70s, I always thought it was a thing, a door knocker that was shaped like a cock.  That's right.  You go up to someone's house and you have to grab the cock and let it go and it bangs  on the door and the guy goes, who's out there?  It's me, a Cockknocker.  Yeah.  An Irish guy.  Yeah.  Not only, two times at 8.04, you said Cockknocker.  So I think we should contest that? 
[02:07:30]  So it was like Cockknocker and then someone said, no, you can't say that.  And you said, what, Cockknocker?  They tricked me.  I was tricked.  Well, so was Dennis at 8.04 when he said fuck and someone apparently said, I don't think  you can say that.  And Dennis said, fuck.  This is all 8.04.  Which I replied to, don't listen to that asshole.  Again, Lenny must have called Dennis an asshole for saying fuck.  There was nine dumps in.  And then at 8.04, Dennis again said fuck. 
[02:08:00]  Why isn't there a second by second breakdown at 8.04?  There really should be at 8.04.  8.04.17.  Now look at, at 8.04, we broke the record for one minute.  All right.  Cockknocker, cockknocker, fuck, fuck, asshole, fuck, shit.  This match I'm surprised at.  At 8.13, I'm surprised at.  Well, no, I'm not surprised at that one as much as 8.09, five minutes passed before Dennis  said shit.  And I'm sure it was, shit, we haven't cursed in five minutes?  At 8.13.  This is the gray area they talk about with the SEC.  Yeah, well. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, yeah, the gray area where it's double entendre.  Yeah, this one could have gone either way at 8.13.  Dennis said, the cocksucker grabbed me here.  That's almost not a lot on satellite.  And at 8.13, again, I was jerking off Dennis Leary.  Dennis is a potty mouth.  Nope.  At 8.25.  It's not me.  People are channeling themselves through me.  Dennis, again, shit.  Yeah, that's not me.  At 8.25, again, Dennis, blow me. 
[02:09:00]  But it was a stuttering problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, because again at 8.25, he said, blow me.  So it's a blow me.  And then he was arguing whether he can or can't say, blow me.  Blow me.  So he argued the point at 8.25, saying, they said blow job on Leno.  Let me follow it up.  Followed at 8.25 by blow me.  8.25, he was on a roll.  I didn't think you could say that that many times in a minute.  So 8.25, it was shit, blow me, blow me. 
[02:09:30]  They said blow job on Leno and blow me.  And then at 8.26, a minute later, he must have been pissed at the whole blow me controversy  because he said bullshit.  Oh, wow.  And then we went, wow, a long time.  Yeah, 16 minutes.  From 8.26 to 8.42.  You can't say they can suck the talent out of my penis?  You can't say that?  His talent has been sucked out of his penis.  What can't they say?  I'd like to contest this.  I was talking about Madonna's husband.  No, I know, but I would like to contest this because penis, you can say. 
[02:10:00]  I didn't say that she sucked it out of his penis.  There's a certain way you can use penis on the radio.  Like, oh, I banged my penis, which would be a cock knocker.  Probably.  Technically, I think you're right.  Yeah.  We might have to go to court with that one.  We'll go to court on that.  I think penis, if you said he received an injury to his penis, something like that.  But anything being sucked out of a penis is a no-no.  What if a snake bit you in the penis?  Opie gets bitten by a snake in the cock, right?  And then somebody has to suck the poison out of his penis. 
[02:10:30]  Dennis, it's funny you mention this.  This happened once.  That's right.  And Jimmy Norton was a trooper.  And it was a gardener snake.  It was a rubber snake that someone threw in Opie's lap.  It was a boat constrictor.  And Jimmy, Johnny on the spot.  It didn't even bite it.  It didn't have fangs.  I just sucked the swelling out because I'm a good friend.  And then they had a little problem at 844 over there.  Yeah, wow.  Bang your kids?  Yeah.  We're talking about the Catholic Church.  Yeah, yeah.  See, not a Muslim.  Not one Muslim remark in the whole thing.  Absolutely not.  Norton's right. 
[02:11:00]  Norton, you're right again.  Norton.  Muslims can bang their kids.  But when it's the Catholic Church, it gets dumped.  So how many?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  22 dumps today.  22 dumps, Dennis.  And that was us not trying to go over and screw up, fuck up the show.  Dennis, that is a true record.  That will not be broken anytime soon.  Well, I'd like to thank the Academy.  And I couldn't have done it without Lenny. 
[02:11:30]  And that guy, Richie.  Who was right.  You got me those two cockknockers.  That puts you over the top.  That's it.  Two cockknockers as an assist.  And yet, I want to contest them.  Yeah.  I want to contest them.  Yeah, the rest of the show is under protest.  Well, the record now is going to have an asterisk.  Wait, when did he say blowjob on a Tonight Show?  When did he say that?  Dane Cook.  Somebody was telling me yesterday.  It just happened to be yesterday.  Somebody said, hey, did you see Dane Cook on a Tonight Show?  You're sure he wasn't giving a blowjob on Leno?  Yeah, he was.  He was on with Lindsay Lohan. 
[02:12:00]  And they said, what do guys like to get for Christmas?  And apparently, he ran up to one of the cameras and grabbed it and said,  ladies and all the ladies in the audience, I want to tell you what every guy in the world  wants for, gay and straight, wants for Christmas.  It was a blowjob.  And Lindsay Lohan said, hey, my mom's in the audience.  He said, I saw your mom at a party last night.  Believe me, she knows what a blowjob is.  This is a great line.  Nice.  Yeah.  And they let it go.  Good.  Wow.  I know.  We've got to find that audio now.  Did she really get fucking self-righteous about her mom being in the audience?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, she stinks. 
[02:12:30]  Left a fucking ear ass.  I got in a huge fight on Leno when I was, I just done it last week or the week before  after my segment with the segment producer.  Oh, yeah.  I had a bit, I have a bit that I do where I bring out a ton of product and I do it on  every talk show and I, some of it's mine and some of it's just stuff that I, you know,  books that I'm reading.  And it kills every time I do it.  A Conan Stewart, even on Leno, the last time I was on Letterman.  I've seen it.  At first, it looks like you're just talking.  The guy wouldn't let me do it.  He wouldn't let me do it because I got there late and he said, we can't make any changes.  It's too late to make changes.  I was like, there's no changes.  Bring this stuff out and I'll do it at the end. 
[02:13:00]  And he wouldn't let me do it.  So when my segment was done, which was, I'm always good on that show, Jay asked me to  stay for Bob Euchre, which I agreed to.  And when the guy walked, I'm sick of this Hollywood bullshit.  The guy walked out like everything was great.  And I said, you know what?  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Right in front of the audience.  Fuck you, 15 years.  I've been doing this fucking show.  I kill every fucking time.  I'm a fucking comedian.  You don't have the fucking boss to have some faith in me.  Fuck you.  But we have a problem?  Yeah, we have a huge problem.  I'm funny, you're not.  I'm cursing it, you asshole.  And Jay was like, what's the problem?  I'm fucking sick of that bullshit, man.  Yeah, do we have a problem? 
[02:13:30]  Jay's like, wait till you see it on dump sheets.  You know what it's like to do a fucking talk show.  Like, I'm a comedian.  I work on it.  I come up with fucking material.  I fucking do new shit on every show when I go on.  I mean, it's not easy.  I'm fucking shooting a TV show, so I do it in the fucking car on the way home or at  home on my computer.  And this cocksucker's telling me, you know, you can't do the bit.  Fuck you.  What am I writing it for then?  You know?  I'm not a fucking rookie.  So, anyway.  Writing it to, yeah, to come on your show.  Yeah, and of course, I'm sure nobody screams at him in front of Leno and the audience.  Yeah.  But I'm sick of it.  I'm done with it.  I think that whatever decisions they make over there at Jay's show are just fantastic. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, Jimmy's kissing a little more ass.  Jimmy's going to be our last, too.  I'm just telling you, I do all the talk shows, and I'm fucking tired of people.  And I left there and went straight to Craig Ferguson and did the exact same fucking bit  and he killed.  So, don't fucking tell me.  It's like a baseball player.  Put me up at the plate.  Okay, here's my batting average.  I'm batting 320.  And you're going to fucking tell me not to hit the fastball?  Fuck you.  You know?  You're a fucking segment producer.  I'm a fucking comedian.  You know?  I'm fucking sick of it.  I'm too old.  Jimmy.  I'm almost 50 years old.  You want me on the show?  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:14:30]  Tell the guy to introduce me, and I'll fucking be funny for fucking 12 minutes.  There we go.  You fucking asshole.  Cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  You know?  My life's too fucking short.  One phone call before you guys leave.  All right.  I guess there's a Rescue Me drinking game out there.  Is there really?  Really?  I want to turn some people on to this.  Donahue in Philly.  What's up?  Can't do it.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Dennis, have you heard about the drinking game for Rescue Me yet?  No, what is it?  Oh, it's great.  It's the Holy Rescue Me game.  Anytime you say Christ, Jesus, or God, you have to take a sip. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, you know what?  I'm so glad you gave me that information because we have six episodes left to write.  And I'm telling you, you're going to need a new liver by the end of the season.  I am going to...  A little rewrite.  So it's Christ, Jesus, and God.  God is a sip.  All right?  Anytime you walk into a church, you have to chug a beer.  Wait, hang on a second.  Wow.  I've got to write this down.  Hang on, hang on.  He's writing it down.  Wait, so walking into a church is a chug of a beer.  Do a dream sequence where you walk into the same church a hundred times.  That's a chug. 
[02:15:30]  Jesus, God, and Christ is a sip.  Yeah, I just got a pen and paper, so start over.  Okay, so I got those two.  Okay, now what?  Jesus, God, and Christ are a sip of beer.  Right.  Anytime you walk into a church, or anybody, including your cousin, like any priest or your  cousin or your child-belesting half-brother or whatever, anytime they spoke was a chug of  a beer, so anytime you walk into a church or somebody that was a priest or is a priest, 
[02:16:00]  you have to chug.  Well, you ain't going to see him no more.  Okay.  What else?  All right.  Anytime you have a vision of a dead person, it's a shot at J-Mo.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  The first episode, when you have all those dead kids in the background on the beach, I  fucking hated you.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of shots.  That's like fucking eight shots?  Seven shots?  All right.  I don't know.  I bought the first season, and second season, I tried to go to five stores to buy that. 
[02:16:30]  That's kind of sold out, motherfucker.  Yeah, I know.  Anything else I need to know about the drinking game?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The third, the last one is, anytime you have a holy vision, like Mary Magdalene, Jesus Christ,  or, you know, like that, it's a double shot and a beer.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You guys are insane.  Hey, by the way, how hot was Mary Magdalene?  I thought she was hot.  She's really hot.  Who played her?  I'm out in Michigan for law school, and you've got a bunch of future lawyers getting shit based 
[02:17:00]  to this.  That's all right.  All right, Donnie.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice to know.  If we get in trouble, you guys will be defending us.  Good director of that one.  Cool.  All right, guys.  Keep watching.  All right.  And you sign on for more seasons, right?  Someone's asking?  I can't.  Ongoing negotiations.  There's going to be one more season, at least.  I can't discuss what I would like to do.  Yes, you can.  It's satellite. 
[02:17:30]  You can say whatever the fuck you want.  I like to shock people.  God, sucker.  I like to do something shocking, you know?  Nobody's ever done a show that just ended in the middle of a season that was supposed  to be a certain number.  Without being canceled.  I've done that several times.  Wow.  I'd like to do something like that.  That would be cool.  We're going to be around less longer than most TV shows.  I don't like the idea of being on for too long, ever.  Plus, I have ADD, as does Lenny.  So, as far as I'm concerned.  He's got movies to film.  No, no.  He's got movies to film.  It's actually not about the movies. 
[02:18:00]  Ice Age 5.  Ice Age 8, baby.  So, we'll see what happens, you know?  There's going to be a fourth season.  I just, you know, beyond that, I don't like to even think about it.  I'm fucking writing the thing.  It's killing me.  You know what I mean?  Fuck, I wish Lenny was writing it.  Then I'd be fine.  Lenny, it's a lot of fucking work.  I can barely read.  I know.  Can you read?  Well, not really.  No.  No.  Because he's dyslexic.  You just tell me what you want.  You've got to sit in the trailer with him and tell him his lines.  No, he has to put his lines on cardboard, and he has to walk around him.  It's tough for him, man.  Flash cards. 
[02:18:30]  The first book you read was after...  The first book I ever read was Merv, and I stole it on the way to Hawaii.  I'm not proud of it.  Did you see Merv and Larry King?  He's like 80 years old.  He still smokes.  He looks like he's 50.  Oh.  That semen diet must really be working, huh?  I've got to tell you, I took off in a hot air balloon out of his backyard, and I was  so excited, you know, because I took the wife.  She said, let's do something romantic.  We end up in Merv Griffin's backyard, and the guy, he's got to be quiet.  This is Merv Griffin's backyard.  I said, I always wanted to meet Merv.  I read his book.  The next thing you know, we unleashed the hounds.  The dogs were chasing, nipping at the balloon. 
[02:19:00]  What the hell are you doing landing a balloon?  What the fuck were you doing in a balloon?  What's up, Mexicans?  I thought that...  You know, I got out of a magazine.  She said I never...  She just landed in Merv's backyard in a balloon.  We took off.  We landed a supposedly deserted air scrub, which wasn't deserted.  But you guys have to understand something.  And this is him now.  It's not like when he was fucked up.  Right.  He comes, a couple months ago, he comes to hang out, whatever we were doing, and he  goes, I'm going to get shot out of a cannon.  I go, what?  Dead serious.  I go, he goes, I want to get shot out of a cannon, but I found out that it's pretty 
[02:19:30]  fucking dangerous.  80%?  86% failure rate.  Yeah.  He wanted to fucking get shot out of a cannon.  I go, what are you...  You've lived this long, and this is how it's going to end?  Well, you know, I mean, some circus folk are all right.  You know, a lot of the county people I don't care for.  But I just thought, if you're going to be in a circus, that's the way.  That's the way.  The cannon guy.  Because I ran away from a circus and joined the home.  However, if it had been the other way around, I would have been the cannon guy.  But I found, I saw this, like on a history channel, one of these channels, all the deaths 
[02:20:00]  involved, 86% death rate.  That's not good.  Another dream dies.  Yes.  So, you know, being older now, I just said, I'm going to let it pass.  These guys are cleaner now than they were on Terrestrial.  I know.  You know, fucking...  There you go.  Tom Saletti just fucking flew.  For Christmas, I bought him through the Air Force.  I got him a fucking...  The Blue Angels?  No, in the jet fighter, where you get the dog fight.  Oh, the dog fight.  The dog fight.  And they put a camera in there, and he fucking puked twice, but he fucking...  He did six dog fights.  How'd he do?  He did all right, man. 
[02:20:30]  But this is a real dog fight.  Oh, I know.  You're rolling.  You're fucking awesome.  You're in control of the pilot.  Are you flying?  No, I'm not doing it.  Fucking Tom Saletti did it.  Did they let you fly?  Yeah.  He flew the fucking jet.  The pilot takes you up.  The pilot takes you up.  But then you get control of it.  You get lessons on how to fly the thing.  And then if you get in trouble, there's a pilot that's going to...  But you're responsible for getting the guy into your sights and hitting the trigger,  and they have some kind of infrared or whatever it is that hits the other plane.  And the other guy's trying to keep you off his ass.  You're actually flying the plane, though. 
[02:21:00]  It's awesome.  It's a real-life video game.  And then the pilot lands it for you.  That seems bad.  I can't.  That sounds like a bad idea.  How cool does that sound?  Well, it sucks.  And they use, like, old Russian MiGs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, they get these planes that they bought off a Russian surplus.  It's crazy.  All right.  One more phone call.  Sounds like a blast.  Then we've got to get these guys out of here.  Jamie in Houston.  Jamie.  Hey, guys.  You rock hard down here in Missouri City.  Hey, tell the story.  I remember you telling the story on Alex Bennett years ago about when you were rassled up. 
[02:21:30]  Julia Childs one night.  A Julia Childs story?  Yeah.  Oh, we went to her house and fucking broke her window and said, make us breakfast, you  bitch.  And then her husband came out.  And, you know, I could have beat him up, but he was too old.  You know, you don't want to beat up an old guy, especially when you heard the police sirens  coming.  But someone said, we were out, we were pretty high.  And someone said, man, I'm hungry.  I go, let's go buy Julia Childs house and have a maker's breakfast.  And someone said, agree with me, and we ended up there.  Someone thought that was a good idea. 
[02:22:00]  I always love when you say that.  Somebody agree with me.  Like, that's why it happened.  It wasn't Lenny's fault.  I said a crazy idea.  And somebody said, let's go.  And off we went.  And you know that a guy that agreed is as drunk as you are.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, I got to get to say it on your resume.  I met Walter Cronkite.  Oh, my God.  It's one of my favorite stories of all time.  So I see him down.  He lives on the island.  And I went up to him.  Hey, Walter Cronkite.  Hey, don't want to get away from me, you push cocksucker.  Walter Cronkite saying cocksucker.  Walter Cronkite called me a fresh cocksucker.  Wow. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, he's fucking Carly Simon's little sister.  I mean, he's.  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  No, he's not.  His wife wasn't dead a minute and he was banging her.  Hey, fuck the censors.  I see them on the page.  Which sister?  The one that used to sit on the porch of that store in the vineyard?  Yes.  He's fucking her?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's Walter Cronkite.  See?  He'll be fucking gay.  Wow.  Nobody talks.  Hayden Cronkite will be sucking his cock.  Nobody says anything about network news pussy.  See what I'm saying?  Yeah.  These guys get fucking laid for telling the news.  That's right.  Reading the fucking news.  And you get pussy.  I've been a million dollars a year and you are a pussy. 
[02:23:00]  And now even the cocksuckers are saying the war is not winnable.  Who knew he had such a potty mouth?  Fuck you, Walter.  All right.  Where are you off to now?  I've got a, I don't know.  I've got a schedule.  I've got a call.  Oh, you're lying.  A schedule is lying.  Stick to your schedule.  I think I'm actually staying here and doing phoners.  Can you do them on the air?  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  Jimmy does that all the time.  It's hilarious.  Well, that's Jimmy.  Oh, tell us about it.  Tell us about Rescue Me.  Yeah.  And now after doing this fucking show, you can imagine how much is going to suck doing regular 
[02:23:30]  phoners.  Oh, forget about it.  Fuck, cunt, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Cocksucker.  I'm not going to go on to the next radio show.  And they'll be like Walter?  Cocksucker.  I've got a question for you.  You're interviewing?  This broad and this guy who do the CNN morning show, they're both named O'Brien.  Are they brother and sister?  Husband and wife?  Are they husband and wife?  I don't know.  Lovers?  Who cares?  I'm just saying.  A river rescue in L.A.  You never see that.  Yeah, fuck them.  The river in L.A.  You ever seen it?  It's like two inches deep.  It's a fucking river.  It's jam-packed with Mexicans.  You couldn't drown that homeless guy with the bad leg in that fucking river. 
[02:24:00]  You're going to hold him underwater, he'd still live.  All right, guys.  It's been a fucking pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks for the prize.  Congratulations on it.  Continued success.  Thank you.  Continued world domination for you fuckers.  Cocksuckers.  Take the money and run.  Hey, Gotti's indicted again.  What do you know?  You know, something's never fucking changed.  Boy, they will just keep pounding until they get something that sticks.  Oh, here he comes.  Curtis Lewa.  You're all Curtis.  Still wearing a fucking beret.  Yeah, that went out of style, didn't it?  Yeah, right about a minute after he invented it. 
[02:24:30]  Exactly.  After he fake invented the guardian angels.  I love how there's no new guardian angels.  They're all big, fat old guys now.  They're all big, fat 50-year-old cocksuckers.  They can't get a new recruit.  Who are you going to fucking chase, you motherfucker?  Yeah.  No new recruits on the guardian angels.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  Sirius XM.  I want to run and run to high school.  I want to scream at the top of my lungs. 
[02:25:00]  I just found out there's no sense there's a real world.  Just a lie.  Got to rise above.  Where's John Mayer?  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  John Mayer's here?  You knew that.  All right.  What's up, John?  You knew it.  How are you, sir?  I'm really good.  Is your brother a fan of the show?  Huge fan.  That's what I hear.  Jimmy tells him.  He is the host of the virus.  I met John, actually, with Bill Carl. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  I got every holiday, like Thanksgiving or Christmas, I go home, and it ends up moving from the kitchen  table or the dining room table to my brother, Carl, DJing, like foundrymusic.com, just  playing stuff.  Here's this one.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's, I guess, 9 o'clock at night.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So he got me into it.  And then now I just listen to it in XM all the time in the car in L.A.  And so, you know, I'm kind of hooked on it.  That's pretty cool, man.  Nice.  I'm kind of hooked on it. 
[02:26:00]  And you know, the thing is, is like.  Because we don't think we have a lot of celebrities that listen to the show.  You still don't.  A lot of people, you know, a lot of people will say they listen, but you just know when  you're talking to them.  You know, we got Jay Moore, and we got a few that definitely listen on a regular basis,  but I don't think there's many celebrities checking us out.  You know, on first listen, you go, wow, that's pretty rough.  That's kind of like, you know, at first it reminded me of like the lunch table that  made fun of the retarded kid.  Hey, Toby, how you doing?  I'm good.  I like your new haircut.  Thank you.  And then you listen to it longer, and you go, oh, at least you guys are really consistent. 
[02:26:30]  You know?  There you go.  And, you know, not afraid to say like, yeah, we messed that up.  Yeah, we did mess that up that one time, you know?  And to learn that I could come in and talk and then not have to worry about you guys beating  the hell out of me on the way home.  Nah.  No.  It'll happen here, or it won't happen.  Love it.  Yeah, I don't think we've ever done, I don't think we've ever trashed someone after they left.  Well, maybe we have.  Let me think.  To be honest, we probably have, but in general, we have it out right in front of you.  If we have, we'll know in a matter of a moment. 
[02:27:00]  The listeners know more about this show than we do.  That's right.  And then they'll call us liars and why are you lying.  Yeah, you're so out.  You're so out, liar.  The reality is we just don't remember.  And there's so few things I actually want to do on my own, and I'm just about to enter  into a contract with, you know, the big guys again and go out on the road and do radio shows  with sitting across people I don't really want to be sitting across from all the time  that I have literally like four days left before I go into rehearsals and then hit the 
[02:27:30]  tour.  So I'm kind of like clearing out the rest of the stuff that I really want to do before  I can't do it for two years, you know?  Two years?  Yeah.  You've got to give it up.  That's a long time to be out.  You know what the worst part about it is?  Is that I know I'm going to end up liking it again.  And liking it just means getting so numb to everything else around you that you just,  there's no growth in it whatsoever.  Yeah.  There's no growth.  You just get so numb.  You just numb out and you just subsist on like DVD series, you know?  You're the same person coming out of it as you are going into it. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, you're absolutely the same.  I don't hate it.  I just, I just know that in the last couple of years I've, I've, I've picked up some other  stuff I love doing and I know that I'm going to have to give it, like, I know that I'll  be a zombie in, oh, two weeks into the road.  Not as, not as zombie, like not loving what I'm doing, but I'm, your life just closes  in to, it just gets really narrow.  What would you be able to do on the road?  You can't do, I mean.  Like you said, you're into some things that you know you just can't do on the road.  Oh, I, you know, I don't know.  I mean, just, you know, waking up in your house and grilling, you know? 
[02:28:30]  Grilling naked.  You know what I mean?  Just like, you know, deciding to do whatever you want to, you know, go shopping or whatever.  Your life becomes very encapsulated, I guess.  And it's, and that's great.  You're pretty much in a plus.  I just know that I'm just going to numb out so hard.  And then the thing is too, is like, if you want to go anywhere, oh, wet platinum, thanks.  If you want to go anywhere, you have to rely on some like punk 21-year-old kid to drive  you around.  And I swear to God, if I die, it's at the hands, it's going to be at the hands of a 21-year-old  runner who doesn't, you know what I mean? 
[02:29:00]  Like, where's the New Year's guitar center?  It's about an hour and a half out.  Oh.  You know what?  You're pretty happy.  We're not on the level of you.  But remember the time I went to WISP in Philly and they had that kid, the runner?  They're the worst.  He liked to drive about 100 miles an hour.  They're animals.  They are.  I am going to, I will not drive with runners anymore.  What the hell is his name?  This guy was a huge fan and was so excited to drive us back to, I don't even remember.  And they kind of want to show off for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were at OzFest and they had to go all the way across town in Philly there. 
[02:29:30]  And this guy was going like 100 miles an hour.  And they want to look at you the whole time.  So they keep their head turned away from the road.  They act like they just found out now that they're driving you.  So they do that whole clean off of the seat.  Like a bowling alley.  The arm comes in.  Oh, sorry.  Let me get you there.  Boom.  And then you get to know every intimate detail of their life because they won't shut their  phone off.  No, I'm driving mayor.  I'm driving mayor.  Right here.  Blue.  Blue pants.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:30:00]  You ever forget what city you're in?  No.  Or just don't know because every day you're in a difference.  In the city?  No.  No, it's really easy.  It's written on the top of the set list.  It says we are here on stage.  But I mean all of a sudden you're waking up going.  You know, it doesn't really have to do with the city.  It has to do with the procession of the bus to the hotel room to the bus to the venue.  It's really fun.  I think what I'm saying is, here's the best analogy for it.  You know, like in the movies where people have Alzheimer's, like they stop having Alzheimer's 
[02:30:30]  for a second and they like tell people they love them because they know they're about to  have Alzheimer's again.  It's like, I know that I'm about to relapse into Alzheimer's and never call anybody or  have any contact with the world again.  I have what they call a moment of clarity.  That's right.  You go, oh, and then, you know, that's always the part.  I saw that chick flick, too.  Yeah.  It was a Nicholas Sparks novel.  How big are the venues?  What was the name of that movie?  Was it The Notebook?  I dated a girl one time.  Second date, she decided to bring The Notebook over to watch. 
[02:31:00]  That's what he's referring to.  What a nightmare.  Yeah.  It's a little bit like that.  I saw that, too.  And it's a little bit like Folks with Tom Selleck and Don Amici.  Oh, yeah.  That's an old one.  That's an old one.  You should have laughed all the way through The Notebook, though, when she's trying to be moving.  You should have just pointed and fucking just yelled, irrelevant.  What a relationship stopper that was.  Second night, The Notebook.  Because it's about true love.  We should have referenced Awakenings.  Was it Awakenings?  Yeah.  Flowers for Algenron.  One of those kind of things. 
[02:31:30]  So I'm aware that I'm about to get stupid.  Dude, how big are the venues?  These ones we're doing, they're like 20,000, maybe, through the summertime.  A couple of people.  Well, I've been doing The Comedy Cellar.  That's 100, and that's worse.  That's harder.  What do you mean, you're doing comedy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's how Jimmy and I come up.  I had no idea.  How do you like doing comedy?  I actually love it.  Everyone around me, I can't find a single person to endorse it for my career.  Oh, shit. 
[02:32:00]  It's terrible for your career.  Absolutely terrible.  You know, like, I've done such a good job of, like, toeing the line and playing music and  not going to clubs and bars and keeping kind of my juice card intact, and then I just go  kill it.  Like, singularly just kill it night after night at The Comedy Cellar, just trying.  And I just love it on a writing level, you know?  I mean, it's like just a weird chromosome away from spoken word, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh...  Do you tell more, like, stories, or are you...  I'm just still at a point where I'm trying to figure out my voice, you know?  Okay.  Jimmy was there on the night. 
[02:32:30]  I thought it was terrible.  I didn't see the set, actually.  I was...  It was a Friday night.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Which was a mistake for me to do it.  You know, Friday at The Cellar can be brutal.  Which I didn't know.  My greatest nights, I'm lucky enough to know a lot of these guys, and I love seeing them  just bomb.  No, I really do.  Because I also see Jimmy, like...  I tell the story all the time.  I used to, like, you know, go with Jimmy when he was doing his sets in the city.  And where were we?  Stand Up, New York, I think, maybe?  Stand Up, New York.  Jimmy does his set.  Ten minutes kills. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, he can't do no wrong whatsoever.  They're loving him.  Almost a standing ovation on a lousy Tuesday night with a couple hundred people in the joint.  We go across town to Dangerfields.  He does the exact same set.  Oh, yeah.  Exact.  Not a laugh to be had.  I was with Jay, your buddy Jay from Framingham.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  I wish I never started, though.  And that amazed me.  I'm like, wow, what these guys have to go through.  Because it wasn't like, oh, something changed on the car ride across town.  It was the exact same set.  But, Jimmy, isn't it like a masochistic thing? 
[02:33:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, you do it.  I wish I never started it.  Because once you start, you have to have the last word.  And the last word is the perfect set.  Like, I could stop after the perfect set.  The perfect set is never going to get it.  I'm never going to get it.  No, because something else will happen, and you'll go, fuck, I've got to talk about that.  Oh, totally.  And so, look, I mean, where I am in my musical career is a certain kind of an orbit that I'm  so happy and blessed to be at a point where, you know, it's working on its own.  I can kind of, I don't have my hands bracing the house of cards. 
[02:34:00]  It's like, it's going now.  But it's really, it would be really boring to be 28 and not do some other stuff, you know?  So I just love the idea.  I just got whipped so hard by press.  Some kid blogged, well, I did that Friday night.  Some kid blogged, like, well, here's what John Mayer had to say.  And he just put all the setups in there, and they weren't right.  And, I mean, who has ever come back from a comedy club and correctly, verbatim dictated  what somebody's comedy act was?  Made it as funny as the comic did.  Thank you.  I'm glad I didn't have to go. 
[02:34:30]  What a prick.  Terrible.  It's good to know you're bothered by blogs and message boards.  Yeah, but this one was like John Mayer said all in more slots.  And, you know, John Mayer said, you know, use the N-word a bunch of times, which I did not  use the N-word a bunch of times.  So that was a rough day.  But I swore it off and then woke up the next day and said, I've got to go back.  So when you're on the road, are you sneaking out to do some open mics and things like that?  I think I'm going to now.  You should.  I think I'm going to now.  It's so good for your writing, you know.  Neil Brennan, I was talking to Neil Brennan, and he was saying, that was Dave Chappelle's 
[02:35:00]  co-writer, and he was saying, you know, it's just once you do stand-up, you'll be  better at everything else you do in entertainment.  And I don't like the idea of stealing jobs from people.  Like, I'm a musician, and if I ever, I can't see myself being an actor, but if I'm ever  an actor, I want to at least be able to say, well, you know, I did stand-up.  I paid my dues.  You don't want to slide right in and, you know.  I know it's weird.  I've heard a lot of comedians that are just great on a stage.  They want to be rock stars. 
[02:35:30]  This is the first time I'm hearing a rock star wants to be a comedian.  I know Sam Kinison went down that road.  Dice did a little bit of that.  Bill Hicks even tried to do a little bit of that.  Because we want to upgrade in Pussy.  That's what you're about.  You see, comedians want to upgrade to rock star Pussy.  There's nothing mayor can do.  A mayor wants to bang a fat chick.  Dude, he wants a fatty.  He wants a fatty.  Who's that Jessica girl?  Jessica Kiersons.  That's my, that's now my, that's like my inverse Jessica Simpson. 
[02:36:00]  The question I have though is, any other guys in music, you know, go to comedy?  They don't go to comedy because I'm, I just, I don't know if it's balls or just, but they want to.  This is the first I'm hearing.  No, but they actually want to.  You know what they do that's a big mistake and that was my mistake starting out is that they still do it inside their musical set.  And people just don't want, you ever go see, I mean I did it for a long time so I can, I can bring it out, you know, like, or bring it up I should say.  Like, you go see people play and they, in between their songs they do these, like, aren't I cute, aren't I funny? 
[02:36:30]  I'm tuning up my guitar so I'm looking down at my tuner and I'm going, do, do, do, do, and you're talking about some bullshit, you know.  It's just not fun, that's not the right context for it because you do some, I would do some big joke and people would die laughing and then I'd go into some sad song and it just wouldn't, it doesn't, doesn't crossfade right, you know.  So, I don't know, I mean, I love writing so it's like the crack cocaine of writing, you know.  And it's also like you only want to hear things in your voice as a, like, if you're a singer, the people who go to see Johnny's, all right, well I want to hear it in this vibe. 
[02:37:00]  They're not going to accept, like, because he's got a darker sense of humor, man, which is great to see, like, you know, from this to that.  Right.  But they're only going to want to hear it in that one nice, you know.  Yeah, and also, I'm just starting to figure out, anybody can go on stage and come up with points.  Like, you can go on stage anytime you want and say, I was thinking about how weird that was.  But if you can't convert it into comedy speak, it sucks.  You know, and so my first time I got up there, I went, here's some stuff I was thinking about.  And there were no punchlines. 
[02:37:30]  There was nothing in there.  It's called alternative comedy.  Yeah, it was a whole movement dedicated to a bunch of fucking idiots with little round glasses who don't know how to make it funny.  Right.  So, you're off, look.  Where does Zach Galifianakis fall in alternative comedy for you guys?  I think Zach is funny, like, it's like, he's alternative, but I think he's got, like, lines that are funny lines.  He's got funny lines, yeah.  Because he'll go up with a clipboard, which is alternative, but then his lines are really funny.  Yeah, and I don't even mind them reading off paper.  If they're coming up, like, I've seen Colin read off paper.  You know, that fucking, but it's great stuff. 
[02:38:00]  It's like, I don't mind great stuff.  Right.  Someone like Brian Regan can take the most, the dumbest little thing that you would say, yeah, hey, how about toasting those Pop-Tarts or something, you know.  Right, and it's his face pumped towards it.  And make it fucking hysterical.  Right.  Well, that's another thing, too, is I don't have a hysterical, I don't have the hysterical kind of patina.  You know what I mean?  So, it's going to have to be really kind of thought-driven.  Right.  You know?  So, but I've been doing that just for liability. 
[02:38:30]  You ever think of props?  You know, I thought about one time putting a microphone inside a giant prosthetic fist.  You know those, you know the fist, you know the big, you know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know it.  Yeah, of course.  No, and I smuggle them.  Those ribs, you'll tie six of them together like rounds in Rambo.  Hey, we've got a few guys that want to say hi here.  Mark in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, John.  I'm going to, actually, I graduated from Brian McMahon, and I just was calling up because I wanted to see how you felt to know that girls orgasm over the fact that they have your catcher in the rye book still. 
[02:39:00]  My catcher in the rye book?  Yeah.  Did I have a catcher in the rye book?  Back in McMahon, that's what, your name's in it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So now it's all waterlogged?  No, actually, they've been taking good care of it.  They won't give it back.  Who are these girls?  A bunch of girls?  Yeah, a bunch of high school girls.  They won't give it back.  A bunch of high school girls?  Were they high school girls, or are they still high school girls?  No, they graduated in 2005. 
[02:39:30]  How long ago?  Jimmy, write it down.  Yeah, really.  I didn't realize the effect he had on women until we were at the cellar one night, and a couple of girls came over swooning for pictures.  I'm like, oh yeah, he's a rock star.  But let the record reflect that I got up and left.  You know, I don't run out with everyone.  No, I was actually disappointed.  He just took the photo, he was very friendly, and then sat back down and talked to me in dumb charade.  I'm like, dude, what are you doing?  These chicks love you.  He's like, eh, you know, they're nice.  It's always hell.  It always ends up being a situation where you say, I should have rubbed. 
[02:40:00]  Should have had a rub.  Rubbing is the answer.  It is the answer to all problems.  The rub.  Jeez, that DVD's $80.  Y'all at rub.  Let's go to Clay in Louisiana.  A lot of calls from Louisiana today.  Hey, Clay.  Mayor, my wife is a huge fan, man.  You know what that means?  I think you suck.  But when someone says my wife is a huge fan, it says it means you do nothing for me.  I hate you.  I love one of my...  You know, my wife loves your stuff. 
[02:40:30]  And I have to listen to her fucking talk about you all the time.  I was in New Orleans at the Government Mule Show at Jazz Fest, and you came on stage with Galactic.  That's right.  You're freaking raw.  Thank you.  You're freaking raw.  You know what?  Here's the thing.  Part of having a stigma as a pop musician means it's so easy and kind of fun sometimes to just smash it in front of people.  So to go up and do a full-on Jazz Fest jam band set and be able to pull it off.  All I have to do is not be a complete douchebag.  And people are like, it's cooler than I thought. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, you don't have to set the bar that high, man.  The bar is so low.  All I have to do is not...  Oh, look at that building.  I got a pen.  I want to write.  There's a song there.  That's all I have to do.  Let's go to Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Don.  What's up, buddy, man?  How you doing?  You've got to be the most underrated guitar player.  You're like the White Hendrix of today.  Dude, I love...  These chicks, they scream at these songs that you play, simple songs.  And as soon as you go on, they'll rip and just start, like, just little licks. 
[02:41:30]  Shuts them up fast, doesn't it?  Thanks, man.  Well, White Hendrix, I appreciate the boldness of the statement.  I'm going to take the gesture of what you're saying and not exactly the specifics of it.  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  I don't want anybody hearing me go, thanks, dude.  Appreciate that.  The White Hendrix.  I appreciate the boldness of that.  We finally got the girls calling in.  You're like Hendrix without any of the soul put into it.  That's right.  The White Hendrix.  You're like Hendrix with an L.A. office. 
[02:42:00]  Let's go to Michelle.  Michelle?  Hi, it's Rochelle.  Okay.  Hi, Rochelle.  Oh, Rochelle.  Hi, Rochelle.  That means you love it.  That means you have CDs at home just with an M crossed out.  Every time someone autographs to you, there's an R over the M.  Oh, Michelle?  Oh, sorry.  That means she's a little get-toughed.  That's all right.  That's all right.  Keep writing.  You got a little ghetto, right?  Rochelle?  No, no, no.  So you're calling in because you're a Lucky Louie fan?  Of course.  Of course.  I don't miss any of it.  I'm a creep.  No, I wanted to say hi to John and tell him I picked up the John Mayer Trio try. 
[02:42:30]  Say it.  Say it.  And I totally dig it.  He's in second person, not third person.  I'm right here.  Yeah, say hi to John.  Oh, hi, John.  Hi.  You're actually on.  You're not with the screeners anymore.  I know.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You picked up the trigger.  It is funny.  I just wanted to call John and tell him that you're talking to him.  Hey, Jimmy, will you tell Rochelle that I said thanks very much?  John is very appreciative of your compliment.  He'd prefer you don't contact him again. 
[02:43:00]  Do you call up like your mom and just go, yeah, I just wanted to tell my mom that I'm  going to come over later today?  Hey, first time calling.  Give me a break.  Do you call your mom Rochelle's mom?  Gets it wrong.  Michelle.  Do you call her and say, could you tell Rochelle's mom that Rochelle's dad has been doing things  that he shouldn't?  No, poor Rochelle is calling and has probably been waiting on the line for a long time to  give me a compliment.  I'm just berating her.  I know.  No, she's telling me that you got the Trio record, which is a labor of love that I made, 
[02:43:30]  which is kind of like my Syriana after my Batman, my Batman forever.  Very good.  You know, which I appreciate completely.  Was there something else you wanted to tell me slash subpoena me?  Oh, I just wanted to know if you were going to be at the Jazz Fest this year.  No.  When is Jazz Fest this year?  I'm not sure yet.  Well, great.  We're doing well.  All right, listen.  We're logistical geniuses, you and I together.  Thank you.  This next call, I mean, we got to call you out on this one. 
[02:44:00]  Dennis in Philly.  We'll explain in a second.  Dennis, go.  Yo, Ron.  All I got to say is I'm a bass player from Philly.  Love the Trio stuff.  Thank you.  I got to say the fact that you played the Pensbury prom was one of the most heartfelt  things I've ever seen a rock star do.  Thank you.  I played a prom a couple years ago.  There was this high school kid who was a class president, the most, he was so persuasive  and aggressive in getting me out there, and he would just keep writing these letters. 
[02:44:30]  I mean, he's going to be a politician someday, and he just kept saying, come on out, come  on out.  And I just figured, like, let's go do it.  And I guess they had written this book about their high school.  I mean, are you still on, Dennis?  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  Well, I mean, I'm probably not telling you.  It's no big deal.  Marsha Brady did it with Davy Jones.  Right.  I mean, going to the prom.  But it was kind of fun.  It was kind of fun to go play the prom for a minute, because high school kids, they don't  get that.  That's like Beverly Hills 90210 stuff, like playing the Peach Pit all of a sudden.  So to go play the prom, it was really cool. 
[02:45:00]  And then we went to IHOP, and then we had Norgie.  Yes.  That's the best part.  That was somehow.  Because this guy's like, he's such a great guy, because he did that.  And I'm thinking, well, if it was an old age home, are you doing the same  thing?  That's right.  Yeah.  You're going to play the old folk.  No, it was cool.  We really had to twist your arm to play a prom.  Well, this prom is actually...  You should play a mental institution.  It's a legendary prom, because I guess everything from the way they arrive to the  planet, they have a parade before the prom. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, wow.  So basically, this is one of those school systems that has a satire class.  You know what I mean?  They probably have a wicker class and stuff like that.  A wicker.  You know what I mean?  Where's Queensbury?  Is that Canada?  Matt?  Queensbury?  No, that's upstate New York.  It's up by Saratoga.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  I had no idea.  Up where there's like 18 miles between exits?  Yeah, pretty much.  I love it.  I love that.  It's only two exits up.  I love that.  Where do you live?  I live by the adult bookstore.  No, but where do you live?  That's just where I hang out. 
[02:46:00]  That's right.  Well, yeah, I just wanted to call in for John.  My girlfriend slash fiance, she's a big fan.  I love it.  She doesn't like you.  She's like, I'm a Tool fan, but I'm calling on behalf of her.  No, actually, I do think you're a great guitar player.  Actually, she's still a Tool fan.  But anyway, she's a huge fan.  She thinks you're hilarious, too.  So the comedy thing, if you did a show for her, I'm sure you'd get a lot of laughs.  But right now, she's mad at me.  So I was wondering if you could tell her to stop being a bitch to me on the air.  If I can get some sweet, wistful music quickly as a bed. 
[02:46:30]  You want some buttery beats?  If you give me some.  No, I want something a little bit like.  Maybe you said the buttery beats.  Like Delilah.  Yeah, her name is Mia.  And we're sorry.  Remember Delilah?  That woman, she's syndicated.  Never mind.  Yes, I do know, actually.  Thank you.  With a soft voice, but she was fat as a house.  I'm sure.  Only someone that sweet could be.  This is Delilah.  What was her thing?  Was it sex advice?  No, it was spiritual crap, right? 
[02:47:00]  It was thinly veiled spiritual advice.  It was just like feel good kind of like.  And we're sorry your dog died.  And here's R. Kelly, I believe you.  That's right.  Yes, I remember her.  I think she's syndicated to like a thousand stations.  Jeez, she's huge.  The joke is getting staler by the minute if you don't have music.  All right, we got some love.  I have no clue.  We got something for John?  Give him a buttery beat.  Give me a buttery beat.  Me and her name is.  It ain't going to work.  No, you got to be soft.  Oh, but buttery beats suck ass. 
[02:47:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  What is a buttery beat?  Like a break beat?  Like a James Brown fucking seems to help.  You don't have your body as a wonderland you can play in the background?  That would make me vomit on my balls.  Are you really sick of some of the old stuff?  No, I wouldn't say sick of it.  You've had some massive hits.  I wouldn't say sick of it.  Listen, I play guitar too, and I used to play to piss her off.  I'd play that song on my guitar, but I'd sing your boobies are a bouncy house,  and it would take away all the sentiment. 
[02:48:00]  She used to get really mad at me.  Well, you know what?  No one ever thought to change the lyrics to your body as a wonderland.  That's a first.  I mean, no.  I'm really glad I wrote all that stuff, and even if I don't get that much out of it,  any time you have a song or anything you do where you can watch other people watch you do it,  and it's more about their response than it is.  I mean, I can historically kind of go back into it, but I don't.  All right, we're going to go old school for you.  Try to do something with this.  What are we doing, by the way?  I just wanted him to tell my girlfriend to stop being a bitch to me and not just off-ass. 
[02:48:30]  Well, it sounds like, based on what you just said, that you're a real articulate dude.  I see no reason why you should have ended up in the doghouse.  What's your name?  Her name is Mia.  What's your name?  My name is Matt.  Yeah.  And go.  Hey, Mia.  It's John Mayer on behalf of Matt.  You know, guys are crazy creatures, creatures of habit.  Sometimes we'll do the wrong thing.  And in this case, Matt just pulled over at a rest stop. 
[02:49:00]  Hurts.  Did what he had to do.  He's a power bottom.  But his heart is versatile.  Meaning, he can love you, and he can also love Exit 22.  Because of that, please take him back.  After good hosing down on the roof.  He's your man.  Remember that.  I had him.  How deep is your love?  Six and a half is the answer. 
[02:49:30]  Take him back, bitch.  Hopefully that was helpful, sir.  Oh, thank you.  Punch it out, guys.  That was sweet.  How deep is your love?  Thumb.  That was so sweet.  Thanks, John.  Sir, if you ever need any help and John's not here, I'll be happy to give a message to  Mia.  I bet you would, dearie.  Yes.  In Morse code.  It'll be quick.  Fuck it out.  Let's see.  Oh, man.  I've now officially messed everything up with my manager. 
[02:50:00]  I said, oh, no, I'm going on.  I represent a company.  Right.  Sony Music, Globotech, Dow Chemical, whatever.  And I just messed it up with that one whole thing.  It's great to hear.  Trust me.  How many CDs you have?  I've got two studio CDs.  I've got a couple live CDs and the new record coming out in September, which is like the  first CD I got totally right.  There's no dead weight on it.  Yeah.  Not dead weight, but what became dead weight.  There's nothing that will become dead weight.  It's like right from top to bottom.  You look back. 
[02:50:30]  As a comedian, you look back.  I know, and I'll hear jokes I did on my first CD, and I'm like, oh, douche.  Do you look back on stuff and go, oh, that was primitive.  Why I think that was good?  I look on it musically as having updated it, but sentimentally, I know this is going to  sound kind of cheesy, but if the heart of the tune is right, I listen back to stuff and  say the heart of that song is completely wrong.  The pulse of it just sucks.  Not even the musical pulse, but just where it was coming from is just off kilter.  But I mean, I listen back to my first record, and I listen to, I want to run through the 
[02:51:00]  halls.  It has a certain youth to it that I wouldn't want my records to sound like now, but I'm  also not 21.  Yeah.  So as long as whatever you're doing is real for the moment, it's really hard to not.  My second record is not bulletproof, but I was so afraid of people wondering where I  went or thinking that it was an accident or one-hit wonder or a fluke.  Because, you know, if you go away for too long, Maroon 5's got to come back like two  days ago.  You know what I mean? 
[02:51:30]  And you just have to remind people that you're not an accident.  And so my second record was more like my foot back in the door saying, no, no, no, no,  I do this for a living.  And I wish I could go back and buy a little more time on that record.  But that's exactly why it took me so long to make this one, is it's absolutely bulletproof.  I don't know that it's the greatest record of all time, but you absolutely can't knock  it.  If you knock this record as a critic, if you're sitting there and you're like, you  know, just bland, namby-pamby music, it's like, well, now you just don't, now you don't  like my face.  Joel Siegel walked out after three tracks. 
[02:52:00]  That's what I heard.  That's son of a bitch.  Do the critics get to you?  No, because it's all part of, if you read enough biographies growing up, then you know  the way that the arc of the storyline goes.  So all the stuff that happens to me in my life for the most part, I go like, oh, this  is that part of that story.  Oh, this is part of the makeup of that biographies.  Oh, this is how this goes.  That's how that goes.  When people started writing about the radio show, it used to bother us, I guess.  But now we just find it really silly and funny and entertaining.  It's weird.  I mean, well, anybody who's ever written, it's more fun to write about stuff you don't like. 
[02:52:30]  You have more of a kind of palette to write about stuff.  There's more funny ways to say you don't like something than to say you didn't.  Yeah, hell yeah.  And now it's like the internet, and you get these people who are writing these things.  And it's really scary when I think about the next generation, because they're really bright  kids, but they're really, I don't want to say bright, they have great vocabulary and  great word kind of articulation, but they're idiots.  And so they're able to write like adults. 
[02:53:00]  And so you'll read these things, and you'll go like, wow, I just got nailed by this guy  who thinks I sound too much like Dave Matthews.  And the kid's like 14.  But he's so, they're so intelligent now because of the internet, that they're so intelligent  with how to put words together.  And they have a forum.  And they have a forum.  A 14-year-old kid's forum was a fucking bulletin board in high school or something.  I know.  And now, you know, it's global.  I want it to be color-coded.  I want there to be like internet, social security number, ID. 
[02:53:30]  You can't shake it.  Here is your name.  Here's your ID name.  Because if you can plan bombings now.  Accountability, motherfucker.  If you can plan bombings, then let's give everybody a name and an ID and a profile.  And I can tell that if you don't like me, the last review you wrote was on a candle on  CrateandBarrell.com.  Let's put it in perspective.  You know, like, fuck him.  He's light blue.  He's got a color.  You know what I mean?  I hate the idea.  Wouldn't that be great if someone said Norton sucks and you could say, oh, he's yellow.  His color is yellow. 
[02:54:00]  That means he's 14 to 18 and his IQ is, you know, under 80.  Hey, Chris on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  What's up?  Hey, John.  I have to apologize.  A few years ago, you did the tour with the Counting Crows.  Mm-hmm.  I left before you played your first note.  Your body is a wonderland.  I'm really sorry.  That's fine.  You're apologizing for walking out?  Yeah.  I didn't even give him a chance, dude.  I hated that song so much.  It was like shoved down our throats.  Yeah.  You are, well.  You know what?  I listened to you on Ron and Fares and now today, and I'm really regretting it. 
[02:54:30]  You're a very cool guy.  Thank you.  You don't have to regret it.  I've been waiting for you out.  I heard your song on Ron and Fares a month ago.  I've walked out of stuff that I liked.  You know, I've met people that I didn't realize were cooler until I saw what they did on TV.  I mean, you know, I didn't not like him, but I met Bob Kelly for the first time before  Torgasm, and I thought he was hilarious.  One of the funniest guys I ever saw on stage.  Had I met him now, after watching Torgasm, I would have been a little more like, you know,  googly-eyed, like, wow, so what about that time?  You know.  And that's fine.  But you know him as just the creep that he is. 
[02:55:00]  He's just the ghoul that he is.  Did you hear the noises when he broke his leg?  Do we have those?  Oh, yeah.  I broke my leg, dude.  I broke my leg, dude.  I broke my leg, dude.  Bob called me six times yesterday, and so he was coming to the cellar, and he didn't come.  But listen, that's really cool that that guy just thought, you know what?  I feel terrible now that I left.  I'm going to call.  That's really cool.  Thank you very much.  Have you seen Sabbath Live?  No.  Okay.  No.  I should have, because I've been around OzFest a couple times, because we share crews sometimes. 
[02:55:30]  Really?  Led Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath?  For my money, Led Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Because, and I can qualify it by saying, Led Zeppelin is from a blues base.  I'm more of a blues man than I would be kind of a straight-up rock metal kind of guy.  Very good.  Although Black Sabbath is also the only stuff. 
[02:56:00]  He's coming from a blues place, too.  I mean, he's not that much further away than Jimmy Page, but I like, put it this way,  I like who Led Zeppelin was ripping off better than I like who Black Sabbath was ripping off.  Which, when you think about a band, it's really about who were they ripping off.  Not ripping off in a bad way, but Led Zeppelin, ripping off Willie Dixon.  Taking and making better.  Ripping off.  I can tell you every song on my new record is ripping off something, and that's the way it should be.  You'll never know, because it's ripped off well. 
[02:56:30]  I like his new song, Nutty Train.  Nutty.  Let's play the single.  Woo, woo, woo.  Dun, dun, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Woo, woo, woo.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Woo, woo, woo.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Woo, woo, woo.  Did you want to play the Bob Kelly for him?  I mean, it's sort of there, but I stepped all over it. 
[02:57:00]  Listen to that idiot.  That's pain and fat stomach when combined.  Is he really throwing up, or is he just retching?  No, he's laying there.  No, but I mean, when he throws up in the studio and stuff, is he?  Oh, he's vomiting.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's actual product.  Yeah.  He would retch, like, for a while.  And then he's expectorating.  And then stuff comes up.  Yeah, like bile.  Something from some little gland down there.  He has a weak stomach.  Like, Bob is, I remember one time, we walked into my gym, and Bob walked, like, around. 
[02:57:30]  I was at the urinal, and we turned around, and I just turned, and I showed him my cock.  I'm like, hey.  And he went, oh, oh.  Dude, I think I was molested.  Oh, oh.  Stupid.  How could a stomach so big be so weak?  We'll take a little break with John Mayer.  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Nice.  I have a question.  In excess, by the way, yes.  John Mayer, by the way. 
[02:58:00]  John Mayer.  If you were a fan.  I like the song, by the way.  We didn't come back after the song.  The song is all right, man.  It's unbelievable.  I got to tell you, too, it's the first, like, to my knowledge, I know I've heard your  stuff on the radio just because I live in this country, but I didn't know, I'm such  a fucking cocooned idiot with music.  I listen to Sabbath, and maybe, you know, I'm a fucking, that was sick.  And maybe Sabbath.  That was fantastic.  And the song about birds.  Don't worry, Jimmy, they also play me in Buddy Booths.  Oh, all right, I've heard that.  Nirvana, birds from Unplugged.  Oh, yeah.  But if you were, if, the thing about NXS. 
[02:58:30]  And the illustrated book about birds.  If you were Michael Hutchins, and you could somehow look down from heaven, how pissed off  would you be?  Would you be pissed off if your band carried on?  I mean, carrying on as a band, I guess, is cool, you know, like, that's what you do.  But, like, the contest?  Well, that was a little odd.  There's a few things that come up on the show all the time.  We talk about how these bands go on when the main members leave, and it's going to come  down to a point where these band names go on without any original members whatsoever. 
[02:59:00]  And there's a few huge bands out there that are getting very close.  The Who were down to two.  Two, but it was two that they could replace.  Right.  It was just the way it was.  Michael Hutchins, I mean, he was the guy.  Yeah, maybe call it a new band?  Yeah, when you get the guy that's the identity of the band, when he dies, you've got to change  the band.  Carrying on, like, you know, that's up to the band.  You go, like, well, we knew the guy.  I don't think it was, like, remember that one time on the bus when he said, if I ever die,  hold a contest? 
[02:59:30]  Like, that's not, you know what I mean?  You can't reference that.  I get you, yeah.  Hold a contest.  You know what I mean?  If anything ever happens to me, like, say I strangle myself with a belt.  Just say.  I'm jerking off.  I got a belt.  Just say.  Just for laughs.  I'm pulling this out of a hat.  Right.  How about, please hold a contest.  How about the cars going, you know, with Rundgren?  With Rundgren.  And Rico Kasich is still alive.  At least, though, it's called The Cars with God Rundgren.  I think they're calling themselves The New Cars or something. 
[03:00:00]  The New Cars with Todd Rundgren.  We're completely against it here.  Right.  Completely.  Do you know that Sabbath at one point had only Iommi?  And they were called Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi?  Because the rest of the band had left.  This was, like, in the mid-90s sometime, where they had this different singer, different  drummer, different bassist.  That comes down to who owns the name at that point.  Yep.  So now you know that's the guy who owns the name.  They're going to be franchises eventually.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, Journey goes out now with no Steve Perry.  But that dude sings just like Steve Perry.  That's what I heard.  The guy just like Steve Perry.  It's pretty incredible.  But then you look at ACDC. 
[03:00:30]  They had, you know, they were Van Halen.  Have you ever heard of ACDC Live?  No.  The most unbelievable sound I've ever heard in my life.  Just balls.  So loud.  Everywhere.  Like, most things that are loud, you only want to cover your ears because they're a certain  kind of loud that's just offensive.  I've never heard loud be that just, like, thrusting.  It's unbelievable.  I saw them at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and it was the induction ceremony a couple years  ago when they were on with Steven Tyler.  I saw them years ago and I thought my guts were going to come out of my ass. 
[03:01:00]  Like, your whole body would shake.  It's unbelievable.  Hip-hop's got nothing on the subsonic bowel.  Wake up the next morning.  It's like, whoosh.  It's all you hear.  Yeah, and it's not the high whistle.  It's like the foo.  The Angus Young.  That was horrible waking up after some of those concerts.  They were like, uh.  Yeah, but you know, at least you lose your ears to something good.  Yeah.  You know? 
[03:01:30]  Like, there are times I'm sitting in the front row of a show or, you know, somewhere  in the middle and I hear something and I'm like, this is wrecking my ears.  And you know it is, yeah.  But let it be this band.  Let it be this band that's wrecking my ears.  Let it be, you know, ACDC or.  So you get into your 30s or 40s and trying to sleep at night and all you're hearing is  I had that on the Trio Tour.  I had the worst hearing damage on the Trio Tour because, I mean, we were a power trio.  So we went out and I would come, get off stage, never enjoyed a single post-show because  I couldn't hear.  And I was so scared that it was going to stay like that. 
[03:02:00]  What kind of monitors you used?  It wasn't even the, oh, we were using the wedges, like the straight up stage monitors.  Oh, okay, yeah.  And it was all about.  No one's using those anymore.  Well, and we had those.  And it was all about how loud are you.  I mean, Steve Jordan pounding on the drum.  And then me with my amp.  I mean, you have.  And you got your back line just blasting you from anywhere you turn.  Nobody in the country can match me on amps.  Nobody.  I mean, I get boners on amps.  You know, some people come over to my garage.  Let me show you my car.  I don't know anything about cars.  I drive a hatchback. 
[03:02:30]  It says Porsche on it, but it's hatchback.  But amps and stuff.  And it was all about taking it out on that tour and just dialing it in as loud as you  could possibly go.  Like, if you're doing a mob movie, you're going to smoke.  You're going to smoke a lot.  You're going to come home coughing.  You know what I mean?  I did Goodfellas 2.  I'm coughing.  I came back from a blues tour.  My ears were just wrecked.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Terrible.  That's a real way to end a conversation with an uninteresting story.  Yeah.  Why not?  When are you guys...  We've done it plenty of times here.  I trust me. 
[03:03:00]  We have.  When are you guys...  You're talking with Sheryl Crow.  When are you guys coming to New York?  Uh, yeah.  Actually, really early on in the tour for the first time, which is cool.  I would say...  I would love to come to him.  I think you should come out.  You should come out.  We'll give you the T-shirt gun.  There you go.  Shoot the T-shirt gun.  I don't have a T-shirt gun.  Jimmy will kill somebody with him and be arrested.  Now that I...  Now that I reference...  I really want it.  What's that?  T-shirt gun?  In the old days.  You know what a T-shirt gun is?  No.  T-shirt gun is like a...  It's at every sporting event.  Yeah.  It's...  They take these shirts, the free T-shirts, and they...  I don't...  They throw it into a tube. 
[03:03:30]  Rubber band them on really top.  Oh, okay.  And then blammo.  There's a CO2 or something on it.  Okay.  So you're not just getting the first three rows of shirts.  It's like...  This shirt is shaped like a can when they put it in there or something.  Yeah.  And then they just...  Bam!  Hot chick shooting into someone's head.  Right.  Let's go to Rodney.  Rodney in Connecticut.  Hey, John.  Hey.  What's up, man?  I'm good.  How you doing?  A while back, you had a little intro on your MySpace page.  Yeah.  You remember what I'm talking about?  My MySpace page is only for messing around with people because I think it's just such a goof. 
[03:04:00]  Anybody who takes their MySpace seriously, it's only a goof.  You have to goof on it.  So I've just done a bunch.  Is that what I did?  Welcome?  It was like welcome.  It was a miracle, man.  Yeah.  John Mayer's MySpace.  John Mayer's MySpace page.  What was it?  What was it like?  All dramatic.  It was this really, really like...  If Fabio was walking through mist, that's the music that I'll be playing.  And what was it?  It was just like breaking through the mist of clouds.  Naked. 
[03:04:30]  Walking a rare white tiger.  Oh, no.  And then it was like, you know, you always have to have the other whisperer, John Mayer's  MySpace page.  He's beautiful.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sophomore vlogs.  That's not wrong.  Wow.  Turn that around.  What's this about?  Is this off your MySpace page?  I can't.  Yeah, that's right.  Somebody...  Explain that because that's pretty funny.  Somebody on my MySpace, myspace.com slash John Mayer.  John Mayer.  Uh, if you want to browse some very good looking girls, uh, and message them and taunt them, 
[03:05:00]  um, do me John Mayer.  This girl, this girl wrote do me John Mayer and she's 17 in her profile.  I looked it up.  Believe me.  Um, it doesn't always come that easy.  She did it on her midriff.  Do me.  Yeah.  She wrote on her midriff.  And so I wrote back on my midriff, that would be illegal.  I watched Dateline.  Which is now the best.  Yeah.  The best television on earth is how to catch a predator on Dateline.  Oh, yeah.  There's no better show.  They're on like volume 80 now.  It doesn't matter.  They realize that people are watching. 
[03:05:30]  It doesn't matter.  I just love watching a grown man hand a piece of paper to another guy and say, are these  your balls?  How many friends does Mayer have?  He's got a couple hundred, Jim.  I have over 400 friends on MySpace.  I know all of them.  Thank you.  I don't know.  It's like, I don't even know.  What is it?  Um, 781.  781.  84,000.  84,000.  All right, cool.  Because here's what I'm going to do.  Go to his page and post. 
[03:06:00]  I'm going to put up my picture.  Me and John, the first time we met, we took a photo.  So you bet I'm going to try to get some fucking...  You are a fucking...  I'm going to try to siphon some girls from that page.  I'll tell you what.  Me and Jimmy had a competition going to see who could get more friends.  And it was like neck and neck for a while.  And then Jimmy lies like a motherfucker.  It gets on here and says, I'll send money to the people that become my friend.  And I have been sending $500.  Shut up.  That's why he's doing the Comedy Cellar every night.  That's on fire.  He subsidizes MySpace. 
[03:06:30]  No, but I'm not knocking my fans.  I have great fans.  And here's the thing.  Anything I tell them that I'm into, they will be into.  And there's stuff I'm into that I want to keep for myself, like really cool brands and  clothes and like underground stuff that I don't even want to say I like because they'll  be in the front row going like, I got two.  I'm wearing the shirt too.  So, I mean, you know, once you post, they're going to be at the cellar.  I'm going to go just put my picture with John up and just try to get girls to come over  and get to know me.  You might have a line of Asian girls outside the cellar at four o'clock in the afternoon. 
[03:07:00]  He's horarious.  That's funny.  This one girl, her name is like John Mayer Fanatic.  She's really nice.  She'll like, I'm on MySpace.  She'll say hello.  We chit-chat.  It's silly.  And I'm like, yeah, well, if you're ever in New York, I'll try to get you a shot with  John, meaning a photo.  And she's like, oh, I don't know.  I don't think I'm pretty enough for him.  And I'm like, a photo.  Not a shot in bed, you dumb bitch.  Not all.  See if I can get you a relationship with you, Goose. 
[03:07:30]  They're really cool.  Get you fucked.  They're also passionate that you have to control their zeal.  With that many friends, do you answer back?  Do you have somebody that does?  I sure don't.  No, I don't answer back.  Because let me tell you something.  It's a one-way street.  I have about 25, somewhere around 25,000 friends.  That's cute.  Do you really?  What do you got, Jimmy?  I don't answer people back.  33,000.  I don't answer. 
[03:08:00]  33,000.  And ask Jimmy.  I do answer.  I know you answer.  Yeah.  Ask Jimmy something personal.  Yeah, but now, okay, what do you answer back with?  Thanks for being a fan.  Let's see if you answer back, Jimmy Norton.  I answer.  I do answer.  I answer a lot of them.  I can't get to all of them.  Is it a form?  Is it copy, paste, send?  Copy, paste, send.  No, I actually don't.  A lot of times I just read.  I do read.  I don't ever delete without reading it.  I've never deleted.  I have like 17,000 emails I have not opened.  I can't, I've never got to all of them.  Yeah, but what about the one, I mean, I get ones I say, come to Philly.  What do I answer?  I'm coming. 
[03:08:30]  I know.  Yeah, I know.  There are some you can't answer.  But I don't think they expect an answer.  No.  When someone's asking you a question, though.  I do look at them, though.  You can't just go, hey, thanks for your support.  You know why I look at them sometimes?  Because I go, oh, she's cute.  Right?  I go, look at her.  And they're always in the same look, like the look down, kind of George Clooney.  The eyes, face, look.  The angle and the chin and the kiss.  And then the big, giant, I hate my face glasses that we wear now.  I hate my face.  I put makeup on one day and I have to keep up with the lie every day and I don't want  to.  And then you go like, this is amazing. 
[03:09:00]  Who is she?  And you click on it and it's almost a different person.  You have to like, you have to forensically match the face.  Like, I guess technically it is.  How many other shots did they take before they found the one?  Yeah, there's the eye shot, too, where it's just the girl's eye.  And it looks like, wow, that's a pretty eye.  Or the mirror shot.  Them in front of the mirror.  Like, I'm supposed to go, there's two of them.  I can't tell.  Yeah, it's like, why is that elephant wearing a pretty girl mask?  And then there's the one that's really far away. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's the one.  You're a mile away and you click on the picture to see.  Maybe there's some close-up pictures.  No, no.  It's the only one.  Totally mile away.  Here's how you know that they're a big fatso.  When there's one picture of only their face and every other picture is of their dogs and of  their apartment.  This is my fish.  It's $3.50.  My fish.  How many times, though, and it's the sunglasses, man.  You'll walk up on a group of girls and you'll instantly, your first gut reaction is, all  of them are hot.  Because you can't see any features.  You see hair and the silhouette and those glasses.  It's sunglasses. 
[03:10:00]  And then all of a sudden you start to break them down and you go, oh, not you.  Oh, no.  And all of a sudden they just develop like a Polaroid picture of like, oh, as you shake  it, you're like, there is nobody redeemed.  How far I've come from two seconds ago when I first thought I wanted every one of these  girls.  And they know it.  They know it.  This is why they wear the sunglasses.  They're getting bigger all the time.  Pretty soon it's just going to be like a burka.  Just a visor.  Like a Polaroid.  I love you.  We associate sunglasses with beauty and glamour and movie stars. 
[03:10:30]  And then there's like a psychological thing that when you see them, you just assume the  person's either famous or hot.  And usually they're neither.  All right.  The group pic in the profile is never good either.  There's always a hotter person than that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's me and somebody.  And they're like, which one is?  The kissy shot.  The blowy kissy shot is always a little weird.  Yeah.  But even me, like I don't put press photos up on my mind.  Okay.  And now that I've taken the piss out of like my fans, which is really great marketing. 
[03:11:00]  If you think about it.  It hasn't hurt us yet.  Yeah.  You know, there's the parrot heads and then the John Mayer stupid bastards.  You know, like artists have MySpace pages too.  And so there's some artists MySpace pages I don't like because they're so corporate.  And the MySpace is supposed to be really engaging.  And when you see like a band and their MySpace quote is new album in stores now.  Yeah.  It's a little, it's a promo shot.  A little pushy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So my MySpace pictures are like really me doing stuff.  Yeah.  That's what you want. 
[03:11:30]  And that's how you know it's the real artist and not promos.  If there's like home shots or just hanging out with your brother or just doing something.  It's not a phony shot.  It's just a studio publicity shot.  Yeah.  Who wants that?  That you can pull off of Google.  Right.  Do you have to be a friend to post a comment on your page?  No.  All right.  Go ahead.  No, you can just, I think you can just post comments.  I approve all comments.  You have to approve all comments.  Oh, you do?  Oh, they won't all be kind.  For you.  Oh, so they are on my page if you notice.  Wait, wait.  So you, you, you don't want to have a MySpace page with any unflattering comments.  No, no.  I don't trust what content they'll put up like pornography. 
[03:12:00]  I don't, I'm afraid they're going to put up pornography or copywritten stuff and that  can get your profile yanked.  That's all it is.  Oh, no, I'll put it up actually on Pleasant Thomas.  Jim, you suck.  Believe me, those go up.  I don't ever edit them.  Oh, self-deprecating stuff goes up there.  Yeah, I'm just afraid they'll put stuff.  So if you guys send me pornography or whatever, nude stuff, I don't put it up because then  you get my profile yanked.  So it's, don't stop sending me nude stuff because I just won't put it up.  And I've had a couple of like really like young teen girls that ask to be friends.  Man, it's weird.  You got to, you know.  Like, like, it's a really.  You got to make them friends really quickly and see where they are and look through all their friends. 
[03:12:30]  I don't mind retarded photos.  There can be funny, but don't send me stuff of retarded kids.  I don't want, I have a line.  Oh, you get pictures of retarded kids?  Yeah, and it's like, I don't mean, I understand what you're doing.  It's like, but come on, dude, I am a human.  I mean, I can't put that stuff away.  Yeah, but what, did they just send you pictures?  But if you think about it, like, and this has got to be weird for all three of you guys,  is you guys portray, not portray, you are, and you're spouting on a certain kind of thing.  But your fans want to play along.  Like, I always think about what it would be like to be like Letterman and how people, 
[03:13:00]  everyone would want to come up, you'd try to make Letterman laugh.  Like, I would think you'd want to make Letterman laugh.  And in trying to do that, you make an absolute fool out of yourself.  So you must all the time be aware that people are trying to hit the top of the festival,  like the carnival game bell.  And sending a retarded kid in a picture is somebody's poor estimation of what Jimmy Norton thinks is funny.  Well, it's only because it's like, I mean, we make fun of it as an intangible thing,  as like a removed, distant thing.  But, you know, to look at a picture of a really retarded kid, you know, it is kind of sad. 
[03:13:30]  I don't mind a picture.  Look at our little Jimmy's Got Feelings.  I don't mind a picture.  But, I mean, like, when it comes to the caption, which probably makes me laugh when I read it.  Yeah.  I do actually laugh.  Some of them do.  Oh, dude, there are some funny bastards out there.  You know, I hate that guy.  It's a, does this nose ring make my ass look big?  Oh, that big dopey.  He sends attachments for your comments that you'd have to scroll your whole page over  eight times sideways to see this thing.  And he sends them consistently every day. 
[03:14:00]  And I've never posted one.  Really?  I approve all of his, I think, unless they're new.  They're too big.  It ruins your page.  But how weird is it that these are just people in their house and you're talking about them  on the radio?  They're as good as famous.  Oh, yeah.  They're as good as famous.  It's because it's TV now.  It's like what used to be a guy that had to be on TV to be a TV star.  Now, on the computer, you have this fame.  People get famous.  You just have to be really good at being sarcastic now.  Yeah.  Like, you have to take a picture of somebody who's, like, taking a break from working 24-7  on a movie and then be like, look at her butt. 
[03:14:30]  It's really weird.  It's really weird.  Like, a lot of those VH1 shows, I can't stand the ones where the people are sitting down  and they have, like, they should just have the word barely in front of what they do for  a living.  Like, barely comedian.  Or, like, barely actor.  Because they're sitting there, you don't know who they are, and they sit there like  they've been on the thousands of things.  And they're like, when J-Lo walked the red carpet in 1999.  The clip shows, yeah.  And it's just like, you're going to get back into your Ford Tempo with the bullet stickers  on the fuel cap, on the fuel lid. 
[03:15:00]  And you're going to be like, once those lights go out, you're back to, like, your house smells  like cat shit.  What was she thinking wearing that?  Right, right.  Because to be caught dead on the...  Lights go out.  Boosh, boosh.  Thanks a lot.  All right, thanks.  Lav mic comes off.  They walk out into the blaring sun of mediocrity.  You got, like, five bucks I could borrow?  Get your fucking scale check with taxes out.  Oh, it's disgusting.  That's great.  We have to wrap up, unfortunately.  We got some stuff to do today. 
[03:15:30]  You going to come back, John?  I would love to, man.  And any time I mess up and do stupid shit, and you guys want to know about it, and it's  in the paper, and call me, and I'll set it straight and say, yeah, I messed up.  We started a nice new relationship here today.  Can I do one thing as a sign-off?  I've always wanted to do this since I've started listening to the show.  You fucking cunt.  You're listening to the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  The next couple of days, temperature is going to stay well above normal after a couple of 
[03:16:00]  days well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast for tomorrow.  Sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  You're going to see temperatures in the low 60s and mostly sunny skies.  Look at that as we head toward Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  Whoopsie.  You're fired.  Goodbye.  Ouch.  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  That was a year ago? 
[03:16:30]  Obviously.  Then we played that clip for the first time?  Wow.  That went quickly.  Yeah, that guy fucked up.  Are they doing two of those a year now, Martin Luther King?  Is that important?  Because that seems like half a year ago.  All right.  Guy fucked up and he was out the door pretty much that afternoon.  Do you have a new job or is that it for him?  Jimmy the Greek and his ass right to the grave.  I have no idea what happened to that guy.  Poor guy.  Poor guy. 
[03:17:00]  How do you go for that next job?  What was your last job?  Your last employer?  I was at W Blah Blah Blah News.  I was the weatherman over there.  Okay.  A reason for leaving that job?  A little problem on there.  What was that?  I said Martin Luther Coon on Martin Luther King Jr.  All right.  Well, we'll call you.  And they never.  Why don't these motherfuckers ever fuck up white people's names?  See, this is why I'm here today.  Just because.  Just to make sure white people behave themselves.  My mom Luther King's birthday.  We have to behave ourselves. 
[03:17:30]  No one ever says, hey, today's George Washington faggot's birthday today.  Why are they always frotting and slipping with niggas?  I don't understand it.  They give them crap about the wooden teeth, I think, is that thing.  And, well, President's Day, right?  Isn't that today?  Is that coming up soon or something?  I don't know.  Like they want to lump it all into one thing.  But Lincoln's getting a little abuse on the History Channel.  I got to watch this.  See, what is the coalition between Lincoln and him getting a bad rap? 
[03:18:00]  He helped us out.  Now they got to expose him for the nut case.  He was a schizophrenic.  He was a fucking nut.  They're like, he was waging two wars.  He was one on the battlefield, one in his head.  I know one in his head was helping those niggas be freed.  On the morning.  What a mistake.  On that dreadful morning in 1964, he woke up and said, I freed the what? 
[03:18:30]  Lord, I'm glad he was crazy.  I was going to be picking cotton if that white man wasn't crazy.  Of course he was crazy.  Look what he did.  Look what he did.  He freed the slaves.  He freed the slaves right at the peak of the slaves, right when we needed them the most.  See why we don't like white people?  Do you see?  Let Lincoln be.  How long has he been dead?  You can't talk about how George Washington used to fuck rabbits or something. 
[03:19:00]  Give us that first.  He never did anything bad.  You know what you should do to make it not fucked up?  Just all the presidents.  How many was it?  60 or some shit?  I don't know.  It's been a few.  It's been a 40 something.  40 something.  Yeah.  40 plus.  Do like a succession of specials of how fucked up they all were.  Every single one of them.  And just get, and the 16th week is Lincoln.  You know what I mean?  Just talk about Quincy Adams.  But just don't just say Lincoln was a crazy motherfucker.  He freed the slaves.  Do something else. 
[03:19:30]  Somebody else.  Just one second.  Do you know that absolutely was not a noble thing that he did?  Like it wasn't out of nobility.  I've seen so much on this and read so much.  It was absolutely the fact that it crippled the South.  It crippled the South during a war against the South.  And Lincoln decided that was a good war strategy.  If there was no fucking war, do you think this asshole would have come out and said,  What the bullshit?  Free the slaves.  Can you do me, look it, if you looked at it like that, it's like when you, when you study 
[03:20:00]  Hitler, not to have my life destroyed.  I have done a little dabbling in the study of Hitler.  It's like you could say in his mind.  Right.  It was a business decision.  It wasn't personal.  It was like the Holocaust was so that his soldiers wouldn't go crazy just shooting people in the streets.  It was a helping them out kind of thing.  In the beginning, it was all about getting Germany back in every facet, in business, militarily 
[03:20:30]  building them back, building up their spirit after being defeated in World War I and having  to give up everything.  This was their way.  They needed a common enemy.  They needed someone to blame.  Right.  They put that blame on the people that were successful in Germany at the time, the Jews.  Right.  Who were making the money.  But you can't.  Like imagine, okay, if we, out of context, right, like say somebody takes clips for this,  that this little rant you're doing about Hitler. 
[03:21:00]  Like that has never happened.  Mr. Cumia.  Oh, believe me, they got 800 other ones of me talking about Hitler.  Mr. Cumia has a little mustache now to commemorate Hitler's hard work.  Why isn't his birthday celebrated?  He's a great man.  He's a man in history.  I'm not saying he was a good man, but he was a man that was there in history.  And he heard voices like that nigger-loving Lincoln. 
[03:21:30]  Motherfuckers are so wrong, man.  You guys are so wrong.  White people are so wrong when they do stuff like this.  I am so right, Patrice.  Listen, I am the only one looking through realistic eyes at the whole picture.  So what if Lincoln, what if Lincoln freed the slaves because it was a great, it was  a great thing to do to fuck the South.  But it's like.  It was all about defeating the South.  The South is trying to build and feed an army based on people going, all right, I'll get 
[03:22:00]  you that sugar, whatever you need, boss.  All of a sudden, there's none of them motherfuckers running around.  Now, a good fighting man has to now provide for a family and worry about his fields and  everything.  Oh, there's a saying called impact versus intention, right?  Uh-huh.  The impact of it was greater than the intention.  He didn't know at the time.  His intention wasn't shit, but he actually did the biggest humanitarian move in the history 
[03:22:30]  of the world.  With ulterior motives.  Other than Moses.  The nobility of it was buried 10 layers down under his ulterior motives.  That's like if you come and you go, you know, sweetie, you know, you came by pulling my  left ball and I really, the intention was me not to come, but it's like he, he, we came.  It was a noble, it was a noble.  Who cares if it was noble?  But the end result was noble. 
[03:23:00]  You just said, well, let me, let me get this correct because we don't want to get nobody  in no goofy trouble that you could explain.  And I was in, I only learned about world war two correctly.  When I go to England, that's the only time I ever learned about world war two in a, in  a, meaning, cause it's, it's a non-American viewpoint.  You know what I mean?  So Hitler, if you let somebody tell you his mind, it was a noble, the reason that they  had the Holocaust itself is because in the beginning, he used to just have his soldiers 
[03:23:30]  shoot people in the streets and they would come back crazy.  Like, I can't do this.  So they said, we need a better way to help our soldiers.  More efficient way.  And here's the fucking Holocaust.  Right.  So it's like, you, you can make a case that he was a decent motherfucker.  Well, that's a little hard.  That is a rough one.  Cause it's Hitler.  Right.  But you don't make a case that Lincoln was a, was cuckoo cause he, he freed the slaves. 
[03:24:00]  Can you back do that?  I'm not saying that.  I've never said that.  I said that he, he might've been cuckoo, but the cuckoo part of it was a brilliant wartime  strategy.  Free the people that are working for nothing for the enemy.  It is brilliant.  You take their workforce away.  I'm not going to say slavery wouldn't have been over if the cotton gin didn't, I mean,  the cotton gin effectively would end the slavery at some point.  I think.  That racist machine. 
[03:24:30]  That racist, that stupid motherfucker.  That stupid machine.  Oh, and of course they got to put the word gin in the motherfucker.  Oh, no, how you like the gin and juice?  Oh, the cotton crack.  What?  Well, happy Martin Luther King day.  Thank you.  Regardless of how the goddamn thing is.  I'm just here to make sure white people just don't.  Keep us in check.  Yeah, just don't abuse the man.  You know something, Patrice? 
[03:25:00]  I appreciate it.  Cause sometimes you're right.  I do get out there a little bit.  I need to be reeled back.  Just, oh, that crazy Lincoln.  Oh, that man was crazy.  Even though, I ain't going to lie to you, I will expose something about the black community.  We are not jerking off Lincoln.  We really don't.  No.  Cause black people really are into context.  And the fact is that it wasn't like, oh, we should free these people.  Black people know that.  But it is Lincoln, but we're not on that shit where it's like, he's our savior. 
[03:25:30]  He's our Moses and shit.  We're not on that.  So, I mean, I'm fucking around, but, you know.  They had to do a little defending of Martin Luther King yesterday.  I saw that going out on CNN.  Plagiarism or something like that.  Yeah, every.  Cheating on his wife a little bit.  Yeah, every year, it seems, another book comes out that points out his humanity, you know?  Well, Jesus was supposed to be, you know, messing with hoes.  You know what it was?  He's too recent, Martin Luther King.  There's too much easily accessible info. 
[03:26:00]  Jesus, you know, you can't go into the FBI fucking CIA files and go, who was this Christ?  Get me Christ's file.  Let's see what that fucker was up to.  He was fucking healing lepers.  What's the FBI guy?  The notorious motherfucker, FBI.  Oh, uh, Hoover?  Jay Hoover.  Jay Hoover.  He probably had the Jesus files.  Get me the Jesus file.  Well, I want to take a look at this curing the lepers and turning that fucking water into wine shit.  I don't believe it.  But, uh, MLK, there's a shitload of stuff on him. 
[03:26:30]  They were really looking at him.  Oh, they really were.  And there's accusations of a lot of womanizing, white womanizing, uh, corruption, uh, infighting with, uh, Jesse Jackson and, uh, other black leaders.  So it's, uh, I think it just shows him as more of a human, uh, than I think a lot of people like to put him up in this saintly.  Well, that's, that's, this is all to make sure he doesn't get, like, Jesus, uh, status.  He doesn't get Jesus status. 
[03:27:00]  We gotta chip away now.  You know, so we don't walk around with chains with, like, of him on a balcony laying down on the ground and shit.  He's like, you know, what's up, dog?  It's like Christ on the cross.  Yeah, a diamond, a diamond Martin Luther King balcony.  A balcony.  That's just to make fucking chain it.  To make out what it is.  Yo, I need an iced-out balcony, nigga, just to, you know.  You can walk around with the littlest, tiniest cross and everyone will know you're fucking Christian or Catholic or something.  But you'd need a big thing for the detail of that balcony, them cradling, everyone pointing. 
[03:27:30]  People pointing.  People pointing.  James Earl Ray in the bushes.  This is the big head.  This is the iced-out Mahu King Mertesi, yo.  You got a big fucking stage set on your chest.  Iced-out Mertesi.  I mean, that's just to make sure no one gets Jesus status anymore.  That's what that is.  No one.  He's the closest, I think.  Other than, unbelievably, you know, there's this dude, Martin Luther, without the king. 
[03:28:00]  Right.  That I never even knew exists until 2000, when they did the top 200 people of the millennium or the last 2000 years.  Yeah.  And they go, number three, Martin Luther.  I'm like, wow, that's cool.  But where's the king?  They just left the king off.  Fuck it.  It's some white guy.  I've never heard of Martin Luther until 2000.  Wasn't he like the Protestant guy?  He invented Protestant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, whatever.  But it's like, I think he's the closest since then to get that kind of status. 
[03:28:30]  But Martin Luther King, they're going to make sure that he's not going to get like Jesus status in the next thousand years.  They got to keep undermining him a little bit.  They got to.  Because a thousand years from now, it's like, oh, wow, he really is.  Black people's plight is really like the Jews in Moses' time during the slavery.  And they don't want us to change that into that.  You ain't tote no fucking block up to the top of a pyramid.  Who gives a shit?  They built the pyramids for half a week.  It was half a week. 
[03:29:00]  Now you talk about some fucking.  We didn't tote no fucking.  You talk about some fucking slavery, my friend.  That was slavery.  Let me tell you.  Let me.  According to.  According to Charlton Hester's movie from what I watched.  Right.  Was that Ben-Hur or the Moses one?  It was the Moses one.  All right.  Now.  Ten Commandments.  Edward G. Robinson.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Stop, Jewel.  Stop.  See?  Mother Jewel. 
[03:29:30]  It's curtains for you, Jews.  Curtains, see?  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  All they did.  Tote that box, left that box.  Meh.  Meh.  Edward G. Robinson made them stomp the grass.  Uh-huh.  And water.  And mud.  Bricks without grass.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Yo Brenna.  Yo Brenna was a tough motherfucker.  Yo Brenna just made sure that Edward G. Robinson was doing shit right.  Uh-huh.  And then they just pushed. 
[03:30:00]  They pulled bricks.  They pulled bricks.  That wasn't all they did.  According to that movie, to me, that wasn't as bad as took that bars, lift that bell.  But that went on so much longer.  Maybe the Egyptian sun was a little better than South Carolina sun.  But that's about it.  And I defy you to find a house nigger back in those days either.  Yeah, no, you did.  There were, like, eunuchs or something. 
[03:30:30]  There was no, there were houses.  No, they were house, what, Egyptians, my friends?  My friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, you come in.  Please, my friend.  Cook the pita bread, my friend.  That's where the origin of my friend came from, was back in Egypt.  My friend, no, no, no, no, please, my friend, don't.  My friend, don't.  And I just think that, look, that's a good question, who had the hardest slavery.  Who had the hardest slavery.  I would say, I don't know how long slavery went on for the pharaohs. 
[03:31:00]  It couldn't have took 400 years to build those pyramids.  I think they were enslaved for upwards of probably 1,000 years.  I think it was a long-ass slavery that went on there to build those fucking pyramids.  At least they had one job to do.  Just build ornamentary shit.  When we get this done, we'll let you go.  We'll let you go.  We need some pyramids.  We need a sphinx.  We need a fucking tribute to Ra over here. 
[03:31:30]  I need the sun god motherfucker built over here.  As soon as you guys complete, you go home.  Who was in charge of the nose on this motherfucking fellow?  You call that a nose?  You call that shit a nose?  It fell right off.  If we didn't have the straw for the bricks, Edward G. Robinson was very greedy with the  stuff.  Wah!  Now build bricks without straw.  See?  Wah!  Mugsy, Mugsy, gotta make sure the slaves are working.  Wah! 
[03:32:00]  So happy MLK to everyone out there.  Yes.  Whatever.  In conclusion, no wayvers, Opie.  No wayvers.  Whatever.  This is enabling us to sit here today, Martin Luther King.  It's a good day.  I just can't wait for the day.  This show doesn't acknowledge MLK.  That's why we're working today.  That's why we're working.  Look at us working.  It's a company holiday.  We're like, you know what?  This is one holiday we refuse to take.  We should have did this right out of Arizona.  The special Opie and Anthony fly from Arizona. 
[03:32:30]  Not only are we going to work on MLK Day, we're going to have Patrice O'Neal in to do  the heavy lifting for us.  And I'm going to, I was here to make sure you behave yourself, because truckers don't  call in, and go, I was there when that, he overreacted.  That nigga was faking it.  He's alive.  Him and Tupac and Elvis are relaxing.  Too good.  MLK.  Yeah, happy MLK Day.  All right.  We'll say that with love.  I do.  We did.  All right.  I appreciate that.  We're going to do like black rejoiners and stuff when we come back. 
[03:33:00]  The guy actually during the probably, probably some of the worst times in American history  was able to unite black people.  Something that other people have not been able to do.  They've tried to come to the table and I just can't see it happen.  Marcus Garvey was close.  Yeah.  You know Marcus Garvey?  No.  No Marcus Garvey?  I see.  I have no idea.  You've got to stop.  You've got to stop.  But if he was such a powerful uniting leader, the Whitey would know about him because we'd  be shooting him.  You know why they don't know about him? 
[03:33:30]  Because he actually had the plan that was going to save us.  He created the Pan-African movement.  He bought ships.  Was that Liberia?  No.  Liberia was some, that was supposed to be our fucking Israel.  Because the send every African back to Africa plan, I think Whitey would have gotten behind  that one.  No, it wasn't a back to Africa.  It was stay in America and trade with only Africa.  We have our own ships and trade with only Africa.  When they realized by fucking 1800, they realized black money was the shit. 
[03:34:00]  We wanted to spend some money.  They just realized we do that.  Nigga Rich was some shit from, you know, 1816 and we just bought shit and they was not  trying to have us go back to it.  That's why Liberia failed.  You're not from Africa, though, back then.  A fucking rhino horn.  Fruit, I guess, motherfucking.  I am not buying my rhino horns here in America.  Fuck you, I'm buying them in Africa.  Sugar?  Diamonds?  Why don't we show them?  You know something, we need that, what, I. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, um, Tyrone, go to the warehouse.  We need 18 pallets of lip plates and we need some neck rings.  Uh, yeah, only from Africa.  I am not buying this shit from the white man.  They will not see one penny a black dollar.  Oh, Anthony's just a dirty racist.  His belt is...  Lip rings.  This is what you still think of us.  That's what's fucked up about this.  That's the shit they showed me on PBS when I was a kid. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, thank you, PBS.  That's all they showed me.  All I knew about Africa.  And the carrot sticks on the Johnson's.  Yeah, the guys with the sticks on their dick that shot the fucking blowgun.  And the non-bungie, bungee cord jumping.  Right.  The vine around the fucking ankles.  Jump off the tree, guys.  And you just, even as a kid, you're watching and going, what fucking savages?  Why the hell aren't they building cars?  I didn't understand it was the way it was presented, Patrice.  I apologize, but I was raised in a time that was very non-inclusive, especially on TV. 
[03:35:30]  Dirty country.  I would see this guy, the guy with the stick on his dick.  He wore the stick.  They painted some red on him.  And he had the blowgun.  And he shot the monkey in the tree.  And you'd see him go...  And the monkey fell out of the tree.  And he tied the monkey's tail around the head and carried it like a purse or something back to the camp. 
[03:36:00]  And I thought, how clever that he was able to fashion a little handle out of the dead monkey.  But how come it doesn't stand out in my mind?  How come it doesn't stand out as much when you watch old...  Like, now, you've got to go back to the year one to see a fucking African act like that.  Now, just in the 1700s, 1600s, I never get this kind of viewpoint when I watch these crackers in England and walking around with the dirty hair.  White wigs.  Rats and shit walking around. 
[03:36:30]  White powder with the girls putting the mole on their face.  Throwing shit out the window.  Hey, love.  Bring out your dead.  Bring out your dead.  Bing, bing.  Bing, bing.  You know something, you're right.  How come white people just don't have a stigma for being the savages that they are?  Why?  That is...  You know, you bring up a great point, and I have no fucking argument for it.  Why?  I would be happy if they...  What?  Just give us...  We're seeing like 1800s footage of Africa. 
[03:37:00]  And that's the newest shit they could show us.  Yeah, it's the King Kong shit.  Those niggas can't call me.  Look at them.  Look at these dirty...  Worshipping a damn dirty monkey.  Get your hands off me, you damn dirty nigga.  That's what...  That's what...  White man of the future.  White people have turned into gorillas.  Actual gorillas.  We don't get a break.  And we, you know, we show spaceships. 
[03:37:30]  I go to Discovery Channel and see what Whitey's doing.  Whitey's flying.  And it's building fucking spaceships and discovering shit and new inventions.  And then it's like...  Here in deepest darkest Africa, we have the Bushmen of the Kalahari wearing nothing but a loincloth trying to feed his village.  And he's like, scared of lighters.  He's the god now.  He's like, oh, I'm a good boy.  I have a lighter, you ignorant...  Ignorant colors. 
[03:38:00]  I traded this pair of sneakers for the entire village.  We were all just getting ready to stab him with a spear till he pulled out of the click-clack shit.  Click-clack-clack.  Till he pulled out the paddle with the ball that bounces back.  Was there like a prioritized list of shit to pull out?  Like first the click-clack shit, I would think first.  If they ain't buying the click-clack shit, you go for the mirror.  Look.  Look at you.  This makes him think I've stolen his image and his soul. 
[03:38:30]  Yes, you should go for the...  I think fire's like last.  Then he touches his face.  Me.  Turns to the medicine man for approval.  The medicine man nods.  Everything's cool.  Really, Mr. Genius White Man?  I didn't see that nigga face when I went down to the lake and get a drink.  You fucking cocksuckers.  Yeah, there's always choppy water down at the lake.  Oh, there's a big black fish in the water.  He wriggles the water and the face wiggles. 
[03:39:00]  You motherfuckers.  Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga.  And we brought mirrors and it scared those old...  Oh, dirty motherfucker.  Patrice, I gotta apologize.  I am pretty much a victim.  Thank you.  Just apologize.  I'm a victim of what's out there.  Just apologize for once.  Just say that you love us.  That's all we want.  I love you, but I have no clue what you're about because I only watch shows that are so  goddamn racist.  And now they're going to take the one nigga lover that was associated with his real heavy 
[03:39:30]  and turn him into a nutcase.  Yeah.  Honest, Dave.  I think the graphics was like a little cuckoo coming out of his head.  Lincoln, cuckoo, cuckoo.  You know, they're probably going to tell everybody that no one wore hats like that back then.  It was just him.  Imagine how ridiculous you'd look if just you walked around with that fucking stone pipe hat.  There's a little known fact about Abe Lincoln.  He was the only one wearing that fucking thing.  He was the point of laugh. 
[03:40:00]  Compare him to Hitler.  Notice that?  Hitler, the only one with that mustache?  Lincoln, the only one with that hair.  Oh, there you go.  Lincoln told John Wilkes Booth, just shoot me in the head because I hate this ugly bitch  sitting next to me.  He committed assisted suicide.  God bless that Wilkes Booth.  Wonderful chap.  All right.  Good man.  How are you, Opie?  We're going to take our first break.  All right.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:40:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  XM.  XM.  XM.  All right.  We got the XM satellite radio ads.  These are great.  This is why we're brilliant broadcasters.  We see the future.  We saw the future many years ago before we fucked up on commercial radio.  I see flying cars in Mylar suits in the next 10 years.  Everybody's going to be wearing Mylar suits.  We will have flying cars.  We got this right.  Yeah, we certainly did get this right.  We can predict the future now.  So just to give you the setup, before we became the pioneers of satellite radio, Anthony 
[03:41:00]  and I were doing the old commercial radio thing.  Way back when.  Barely remember what that was like.  We were very successful, syndicated across America in some fine markets, and then we blew  it up.  Might have heard of a little town called Boston.  That's right.  Might have heard of a little hamlet of Philadelphia.  Let's not forget Columbus, Ohio.  Can't we, please?  We got some.  And, of course, New York City, the crossroads of the world. 
[03:41:30]  Perhaps.  How about Vegas?  How about Vegas?  Philly.  D.C.  Dallas.  San Francisco.  Seattle.  How about a chilly little place called Buffalo, New York?  Buffalo and Rochester, New York.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  There you have it.  Just a few of the markets.  That was everyone.  How about New Orleans?  New Orleans.  That's right.  Cleveland.  Chicago.  Dallas, Texas.  I said Dallas already.  I like to say Dallas, so I said it again.  All right.  Sacramento, California. 
[03:42:00]  Sacramento.  Anyway, so we're doing quite well, and everybody wanted to advertise on our show.  Even XM Satellite Radio.  They knew.  They knew.  They knew the demo we held, the power we held with it.  They knew who they wanted initially when the satellite started up.  And right off the bat, this goes back easily three years.  Right off the bat, we're like, this is the future of radio.  It's growing by leaps and bounds.  This is definitely competition.  We have to look at it as competition right off the bat. 
[03:42:30]  Seriously, what did you honestly think when you first heard, like, satellite radio, you can say whatever the hell you want?  Weren't you thinking somewhere, I want to be on that?  Absolutely, but at the time, first of all, we were in a contract.  Second of all, we were doing really well.  We were doing really well, and satellite radio was still kind of just growing, you know?  They only had, at this point, they only had a few hundred thousand listeners.  Probably, yeah.  Probably less than a million.  Yeah, it had to be less than a million.  I don't even know.  Over three, dude.  We were off for two fucking years.  So this is over three, maybe three and a half, four years ago. 
[03:43:00]  I'm sure they had under a million listeners and subscribers.  And, you know, to go over there, it was almost, everyone was equating it to, like, E-Yotta, that online radio, where, you know, 50 people at a time could listen, and then it started clipping.  And people on it were, like, approaching us and going, dude, it's the future.  Is this internet radio?  And I'm like, you know, no, it's not.  No, I can't get my computer on the dashboard, so no, it's not. 
[03:43:30]  Can't get it in the car, especially at that point.  Yeah.  You couldn't do that.  So, no, it wasn't.  We weren't considering it.  Right.  Timing-wise, it worked out perfectly.  What's interesting about this, this goes back, like I said, three to four years ago, and guys on regular radio today are still denying that satellite radio is going to be anything.  Yep.  Dummies.  A bunch of dummies out there.  So we did not feel good about taking the XM satellite radio ads as we're doing our commercial radio show. 
[03:44:00]  And we let it be known.  And we let it be known, and they're like, just shut up and play the commercials, right?  And one day, we just, we had it.  We absolutely had it.  So the commercial's playing for XM satellite radio, and the commercial's saying how great XM is, and I just turned on the mics and said, fuck this.  Listen to sound.  100 digital channels of music.  The competition is now advertising on our show, Anthony.  So whether you're into hip-hop or hip-hop, we have sales wars that work in this building.  Rock stars or stock cars.  You'll hear more, no more.  This is the competition! 
[03:44:30]  What I'm hooked on right now is a wide variety of things I've never heard before.  I could drive all the way to New York, never have to change the channel.  All right.  Oh, good.  Hey.  Turn off the Opie and Anthony show, because satellite radio's here.  You effing whores upstairs.  Learn more at XMRadio.com.  What?  It is absolutely fabulous.  Beyond AM.  This is the competition!  Wake up!  To the power of this.  Price may vary by model and retailer.  Some models require additional installation fee, and tenant subscription also required. 
[03:45:00]  Douchebag!  What are you doing this New Year's Eve?  Isn't that amazing?  Opie's just yelling like a maniac right over the commercial.  Isn't that amazing, though?  That wasn't a recording, by the way, of the commercial playing, and then Opie off-air ranting  about it.  Oh, no.  That was on the air.  That is how it aired.  That's how their fine commercial aired.  XM should get their money back for that one.  They did when they signed us, please.  Just letting the Trojan horse come rolling in.  Oh, God.  Hey, this is a pretty horse for them to leave for us.  Just to put it in perspective, that would be like us running as for Howard for the other 
[03:45:30]  satellite radio company.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Taking their money and going, well, it's money, it's revenue, who cares?  It's the competition.  And that's what the party line was over at Infinity, was, hey, they're paying for it.  We'll air their commercials.  They saw it as no threat.  They had no vision that this was going to do anything.  Yeah.  And they just saw it as, hey, take their money.  Oh, so short-sighted.  You got to be cutthroat. 
[03:46:00]  Cutthroat.  Fuck you.  Advertise on the internet.  It gets better.  So then when we were done with our 15 minutes of commercials, we finally got to go back to  our regular show, and this is how we got back into it.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oy!  And it's official.  We have a bunch of whores that work for this company.  That's for sure.  Holy S.  We're running a spot on the Opie and Anthony show for satellite radio.  Yeah, satellite radio. 
[03:46:30]  You know, it's the new range.  And no one has a problem with this in this company?  That's called the competition.  Right.  And they're advertising during our show, telling people basically that they have another option  out there.  That all over, like, no matter where you drive, you won't lose the signal.  They're talking about all this great stuff that you don't get by listening to the very  station that's advertising it.  Who gave the okay to take that?  A bunch of whores. 
[03:47:00]  Hard enough to compete in this day and age in radio.  And now, now they're just going to run spots for the competition on our show.  And they have no problem with this whatsoever.  So there you go.  Just so you're not confused, that's us, you know, four years ago about on regular radio,  just losing our minds because they're running XM spots during our show.  And it was so obvious that people were starting to get excited about satellite radio. 
[03:47:30]  It was something that, as we were listening to it, you'd say to yourself, wow, that does  sound cool.  You get all kinds of formats of music.  You could drive coast to coast and not have to change the station once if you don't want  to.  Right.  It's not regulated by the FCC.  Right.  This is fan-fucking-tastic.  And this proves we're brilliant broadcasters because now, three, four years later, you  know, regular radio is in deep trouble.  In deep trouble.  They could have controlled it a little bit if they were smart enough to see what was 
[03:48:00]  coming four years ago.  They still advertise, though, right?  They still allow them to advertise?  No.  Finally, they've turned the corner of most of these radio companies and they will not  accept spots for satellite radio.  Finally.  Wow.  It continues.  They're making spots against satellite radio now.  Exactly.  Now, the same stations that were airing, hey, this satellite radio is great.  Come on over.  We'd love to have you, are now going, hey, why pay for radio? 
[03:48:30]  Now, they're all, why pay for fucking radio, man?  You don't want to pay for it.  Well, we got the famous one.  We got like 10 of them, but here's the one we really like.  Here's some of the same stations that were running the commercials you just heard.  Right.  Now, this is today what they're doing on regular radio.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing  a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal or rap stars, but this time, the guilty 
[03:49:00]  party is none other than the easy listening sensation.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some  things were just meant to be free.  A bit hypocritical, isn't it?  Don't pay no attention to those commercials we aired three or four years ago.  We really didn't mean it.  We were just in for the cash.  That's right.  I bought a new quote from that money.  It's so outrageous, we can't even tell you on the radio. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, they're still not getting it right.  But they can on satellite, by the way.  You know how she was saying it in the old XM commercial right there?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So then going back, here's us on commercial radio.  Really pissed off because we have XM commercials on our show.  We discuss it more here.  They bought our show because we have a huge audience, okay?  Yeah.  And the commercial's basically telling everyone that you don't need to listen to Opie and 
[03:50:00]  Anthony, there's other choices out there.  Why don't they just run a commercial with every other show that is on, you know, against us?  Yeah.  And then have the listeners decide, well, I'm going to try out a couple of these shows.  I got an idea.  Here's what he's going to say.  Oh, they're not going to do well.  It's just like that click radio and the E-Yada and all the internet radio thing that failed.  So we'll take a little bit of their money and it'll just fail anyway.  But the thing is, it's not like internet radio. 
[03:50:30]  It's going to be installed in cars and stuff.  Oh, that HBO, it'll never catch on.  That'll never catch on.  It's silly.  People paying for TV, it'll never happen.  If man were meant to fly, he'd have wings.  That is a huge insult, man.  I hope they're getting a lot of money to whore themselves out like that.  Man can't ride on trains.  Don't you know if a human being exceeds 30 miles an hour, he will surely perish?  You know, they used to think that. 
[03:51:00]  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It really is.  So there you go.  We're back here on XM.  That's pretty impressive.  Kind of taking a look at the old days, four years ago, when they accepted XM spots on  our very successful commercial radio show.  We saw.  We had the vision.  We knew that this was going to be successful.  We always have the vision.  You know where the next step is.  We're brilliant broadcasters.  People just don't realize that yet.  And that's our frustration every day.  Finally, I had it. 
[03:51:30]  You're going to hear a curse.  And you're listening to satellite radio, so like, whatever.  A curse.  Just remember, going back about three or four years, this is on commercial radio, but I  was just losing my mind.  I just couldn't understand why they would do this to us.  Radio's really the best part.  Yeah, I got to stop the tape.  The best part, there's good old Ben Sparks in the background laughing like an idiot.  Years ago, cackling Ben included.  Just in case you thought this was the new Ben on XM, no.  He's been laughing like an idiot for many years for us. 
[03:52:00]  Many years.  Radio's really, it's really getting pathetic.  It's ridiculous.  This used to be a business where every radio station was for themselves and they just fought,  literally fought on the street.  We used to get in fights because someone else's van was parked outside the venue for a concert.  Now all the stations are owned by the same person or the same company and they don't want you talking bad about this station or that station because you're going to hurt the company.  It's making radio so bland and boring. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  And now on top of that, they don't mind taking advertising dollars from the competition.  Right.  They see no problem with this.  Holy shit.  They don't see a problem with this?  Will there be cursing over this satellite radio?  Because I want to gig over there.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I want to gig over there.  You know, it's not regulated.  And here we are back on XM.  Look at that.  I want to gig over there.  Cursing on asking, you shall receive. 
[03:53:00]  Should hand that tape into the FCC.  We got away with one back then.  Whoa.  So, someone is requesting, let me go to Pete.  I haven't heard this stuff in a long time.  Pete in Rhode Island.  Pete?  Yes.  Hey.  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys could play the clip where you get your bigger boss on the phone and he's like,  oh, don't worry about XM.  No, they're nothing.  They're nothing.  Oh, Ken Stevens.  I think that's the next clip we got here.  Oh, excellent.  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  Thanks.  I don't remember how this went down, but then we just would not go on with our show. 
[03:53:30]  We were obsessed with this whole playing XM commercials on our commercial radio show.  And finally, we got Ken Stevens, our general manager, on the phone.  What a set of balls when you have the ratings that we had over there.  Because you could just do anything except have a couple fucking church.  But besides that, I mean anything.  Right.  We're cursing.  Yeah.  I don't think we got in trouble for that.  So, we got Ken Stevens. 
[03:54:00]  He was the guy running the station.  At the time.  He was one of our really good friends over there.  Yeah, we like Ken.  That's stuck up for us on many occasions with that whole stupid Howard battle.  But here's Ken explaining the XM ads to us.  So, the question is, somebody said to me,  you're wondering why we're taking these XM satellite ads?  Very good.  You actually understood the question also, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  Why are we advertising for satellite radio?  For an option to listening to this very program? 
[03:54:30]  Pretend for a minute that you don't know anything about the radio business.  And you're just the average guy listening in your car to those XM radio spots.  Okay.  Do they make any sense to you?  Hold on.  Let me put myself in there, Ken.  You asked us for a lot, and you're not giving us time.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay, I'm sitting.  Opie, sit.  So, you're saying advertising doesn't work, and no one should advertise on radio.  Stop. 
[03:55:00]  Maybe it's your show.  No.  Holy shit.  He's also basically talking down to the listeners, too.  Right.  They're a bunch of morons.  They don't understand words like satellite.  It's something up in space, and they don't know that.  You've got to be a rocket scientist to know about satellites.  Jesus Christ, Ken.  Meanwhile, the ad completely explains it.  Completely.  They have everyday Joes going, I can get in my car and drive all the way across the country.  You want to hear any format you want from coast to coast without changing the dial? 
[03:55:30]  Satellite radio.  All right.  You've got to slow that down, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm just the average everyday guy.  I can't take in words that quick.  I didn't understand what you meant by format of music.  Fuck, I should have taped the show.  Then I could rewind it.  Oh, is that a poor, poor argument?  I nailed him so bad.  Oh, yeah.  Advertising doesn't work.  So advertising doesn't work?  Oh, no, no.  It's just fine.  Keep it coming. 
[03:56:00]  Going back to the tape.  I know I'm saying this a million times, but there are dummies out there.  This is us on commercial radio discussing why are we playing XM commercials.  It's your show.  No.  I think that if you listen to the commercials the way we're running them, they're not awfully attractive.  Did you hear the one line?  How many of your friends are going to go out and spend whatever, what does it say?  On, on, on, now insert color TV here.  Insert radio here.  Insert car here, where he is going to say, are you going to buy this right now? 
[03:56:30]  I don't know.  Insert Xbox instead of PlayStation.  Right.  Insert any new technology.  Ken, did you hear the one part in that commercial where he says, boy, I could drive through New York and I don't have to change the station?  No, I heard the one where he said, and my favorite is the Blues Channel.  Right.  Right.  I'm not really worried about losing a whole lot of audience to the Blues Channel.  Well, we're not.  Ken, huh?  Wow, you guys.  But when those ratings come out and they're down, who will be getting yelled at? 
[03:57:00]  Hey, you know what?  If your ratings are down and your audience has moved over to satellite radio, I'll stop taking those commercials.  Yeah, but it's a little here, a little there.  It adds up after a while.  Absolutely.  Wow.  If you're on XM.  I don't think I've ever seen you guys so 100% in the right.  Isn't it so cool that it is almost like me and Opie went into a DeLorean.  We reached 88 miles an hour, went to the future, came back, and just shoved it in Ken's face.  We had seen it. 
[03:57:30]  And you know how many people did come over to XM.  Everything he said, like, well, you know, little by little.  Little by little.  It adds up.  The programming.  Oh, it's the Blues Channel.  Yeah, well, some people want to hear that.  Plus, what I also love is you guys were getting in trouble for shitting on the people who advertise,  and that's exactly what he's doing here, going,  Hey, if you listen to those ads, those ads stink.  They don't even make sense.  They don't even make sense.  I didn't understand a word.  Bill, it's called.  And their product stinks.  I wouldn't listen to the Blues Channel.  I don't think we're going to. 
[03:58:00]  If your ratings go down because of satellite, I'll stop taking the ads.  Bill, it's called Chipping Away.  Chipping Away.  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.  We're big fans of Chipping Away.  Chip, chip, chip, chip.  You know he had to take the call from the guy who was paying for the ads for XM right  after that.  Then he'd go, Okay, wait a second.  I want you to just imagine that you don't know anything about advertising.  Yeah.  He's always wanting us to imagine something.  Yeah.  Picture, if you will.  Right, right.  A world in which people who speak English do not understand it. 
[03:58:30]  We love the chipping away concept.  We've been chipping away at Howard's credibility for years and his hypocrisies.  Satellite radio.  It's not going to go anywhere.  They barely got up that Sputnik thing.  Right.  You think they're going to be able to get a satellite up there that plays music?  It continues.  We ended up giving these guys like a 20 to 30 minute commercial that day.  And we helped them out.  You're going to leave cars at the airport and rent them and people are going to...  Chad will never fly.  People want to have the comfort of their own vehicle. 
[03:59:00]  Right.  They'll have a relative who could pick them up.  Craziness.  Not going to want that.  But why would people want a turbine jet engine when a propeller is perfectly fine on these  aircraft?  You can cross country in a day.  They're too noisy and people are not going to like them.  Why would you want to...  The propeller gives people a comfort factor.  They see it spinning and know they're being propelled.  Who would want to go to the bathroom in their own house?  When a perfectly good outhouse is right outside keeping the stink and stench out of doors.  Fertilizing your backyard. 
[03:59:30]  Why would you want a direct flight to Vegas when you could go all the way to LA and then  go to Vegas after having one of your tickets canceled?  People like seeing different cities.  Even ones that they don't want to go to.  Why would you want to fly into the airport that has your car?  That's just plain stupid.  That is ridiculous.  When you could fly to another airport and then drive from that airport to the airport  where your car is at.  I want you to imagine for a second you know nothing about travel.  Right.  Imagine you're sitting on a plane that's going where you don't want to go. 
[04:00:00]  That's right.  And you're just excited.  Oh, you don't have to imagine.  You were there.  That's why Don, I'm so tough because I'm sick of working with dummies.  Wow.  That's why.  Jiminy Cricket.  You went for big air on that one.  Dummies.  Lots and lots of dummies.  We're proving that we're brilliant broadcasters right here and now.  We have the vision.  We can see into the future.  Just trust us. 
[04:00:30]  That was pretty damn impressive.  I've got to give you that.  That was very like, wow.  We've got more.  Because then there's a question here.  Could ONA go to satellite?  Oh, Jesus.  So going back in time, we're doing our commercial radio show discussing why they're playing XM commercials  on our show.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  By the way, we also did our research.  We study this fucking business.  We know our enemies.  We pay attention.  So when someone is saying, well, you're going to be running XM commercials, we're not going 
[04:01:00]  to sit there like every other dumb jock in America and go, oh, okay, okay.  We actually did our research and found out as much info as possible.  And Anthony is like, this whole going to be an option in new cars.  That's what frightened me the most is I could see something if you had to take all kinds  of wires and gadgets and gizmos that it was never really going to take off anywhere  past just the geek or tech guy or something like that.  But when I heard that these things were going to be factory installed with your AM, FM radio, 
[04:01:30]  satellite radio available right there, just like AM and FM, I was like, oh, boy, now there's  trouble.  I love the bravado of this.  He starts every answer with this little John Wayne.  Oh, that was how Ken operated.  Let me tell you something.  We love him.  And Ken wasn't just any general manager.  He was one of the bigwigs.  He was one of the most powerful general managers in infinity broadcasting.  Here we go again.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars? 
[04:02:00]  Let me ask you something.  Yeah.  You got that newfangled cable or satellite in your house?  You need money this bad, Ken.  With all those music candles on there?  Yeah.  Including the blues channel?  I think it's great, as a matter of fact.  And if you look at broadcast TV, the ratings are down pretty low because of cable.  Answer my question.  Yeah, I do.  You did so.  When you're sort of walking around the house, instead of turning on the radio, you turn 
[04:02:30]  on channel 956 and listen to the blues channel or the kids channel.  I believe there's enough people that do it that chip away.  There's my TV and there's my radio, though.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm not watching TV in my car.  Why assume all this, Ken?  Do we need the money that bad?  Yeah.  Hey, we're in the...  Why don't we just list all the shows that are on opposite us?  Because that's what you just did.  You're killing us.  You know, I took out the one where XM wanted to run the spot that said you were boring. 
[04:03:00]  I didn't run that one.  Really?  Yeah.  No, I stuck to the one that said blues channel.  And the company has no problem with this?  I guess not.  Must have been a big buy.  It must have been here, Ken.  It wasn't a...  Well, they probably will now that you've made an issue out of it.  Uh-oh.  It was supposed to be under the radar.  Oh, yeah.  Because our listeners are stupid.  And this thing is something that Ken has dubbed newfangled.  Newfangled.  So I don't think it'll take off. 
[04:03:30]  I don't think you guys were paying attention, but that's okay.  Oh, God.  All right, Ken.  Well, thank you.  That wasn't what I said.  Thank you for clearing that up for us.  I mean, if you're really certain that you're losing listeners to that blues channel on satellite radio,  I'll stop taking the commercials.  That's all he had was that reference.  He just didn't...  Blues channel.  He did not see the freight train barreling down, man.  Do you think he's just holding the company line, or he really believed that? 
[04:04:00]  I don't know.  I think he really believed it.  I think they all believed it.  I think they all did.  All the heads, you know.  And this went right up to Mel Karmazin, who had the same ideology,  who was, you know, no ad for a competing form of entertainment would be taken if the word  wasn't handed down by Mel.  So he didn't see it either.  And now he's the head of the Doggy Company.  So he obviously changed his tune.  Exactly.  Well, we have one more clip here. 
[04:04:30]  It's quick.  Going back again.  This is like four years ago.  There was a day when sales didn't control radio, Anthony.  It now controls it.  I remember a time that they would fight with the competition.  But now they welcome the business of the competition on their airwaves.  Let's see.  Hundreds of distortion-free channels that travel with you being offered in high-end cars driven  by decision makers.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on.  You know, guys, I'll be doing a gig tonight. 
[04:05:00]  But, you know, I don't want to talk about it.  Let's plug Rich Voss.  I wonder if at some point they'll make deals with people like us to carry our show.  If people want that as an alternative no matter where they drive.  But then it says, okay, what about if you're driving through an area that we're on at a regular  radio station and you can get it on satellite, where's the revenue coming from?  It just throws a whole bunch of things.  Following the logic of this, I'm just assuming that this great company of ours is buying 
[04:05:30]  satellite radio.  Well, you know something.  And they're jumping the gun.  It makes sense.  But you know what?  Get it up there and then fight.  They're probably not buying satellite radio.  No?  But instead, they're running ads for the competition.  And no one sees anything wrong with that.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I just wanted to know, can you repeat everything?  You said I lost the signal, man.  That's classic, you dick.  Very good.  And there you have it. 
[04:06:00]  We're back live here on XF.  Isn't that just amazing?  Visionaries.  Visionaries, yes.  Yes.  We just don't say we're brilliant broadcasters.  We show it to you.  If that was like a made-for-TV movie, I'd be like, ah, that's, you know, one person.  So far-fetched.  Yeah, like, no one's ever that wrong.  Like, whenever they do the made-for-TV movies, it's always like, let me tell you something,  Terry Bradshaw, you're never going to be a quarterback.  And you certainly will not win any championships. 
[04:06:30]  And then you're like, no one ever fucking said that.  That it's just over-dramatizing of this to sell this show.  And that's literally what went down.  Exactly what happened.  Ken Swaggering.  Don't you worry about that, boys.  The blues channel.  The blues, yeah.  Well, let me tell you something.  When you go home, and he's trying to relate the two things, being at home and those upper  channels where the music channels are. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  You know, you hit there, you get to listen to 70s, 80s, all kinds of music on your TV  or your radio.  It is different.  I don't listen to those channels on my television, but I have a radio at home, and I listen to  satellite radio.  Yeah.  I listen to those channels on the TV now.  I've done that.  Because people are starting to chip away at that, too, and realize, oh, wow, I've just  got to go up here, and I can get all these music channels.  But I have XM right there in my living room.  Right.  Well, and if you've got the direct TV, you've got the XM channels right there.  So, on your TV. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, boy, was Ken so wrong.  And a lot of people...  I see nothing with the sex for Sam thing.  Guys, you go right ahead with it.  Three years running.  Maybe we should have had someone else in charge.  A lot of people want to know where Ken Stevens is today.  He's on a boat.  He's sailing the Chesapeake Bay.  He just sails...  ...day in and day out.  That's it.  That's what he does now.  He's enjoying his retirement.  His early retirement.  A golden umbrella.  His earlier retirement that we gave him on a gold platter, and now he's got a golden 
[04:08:00]  parachute.  Time to cash in the stock option.  Yep.  Time to go sailing.  Whoops.  What do you think he's investing his money in?  Satellite radio.  Yes.  I would guarantee he's got shares of one company or the other.  Yeah.  There is satellite radio in every...  I would guarantee every single radio executive has shares of either XM or Sirius or both. 
[04:08:30]  Every single one of them.  They bash it.  They don't believe in it.  They make ads saying, don't listen to it.  Don't buy it.  And I believe most of them...  It should be free.  And they buy, buy, buy the stock.  And I believe most of them are listening to satellite radio, too.  Yeah.  They're secretly sending, faxing their resumes over.  Oh, of course.  Under assumed names.  You know they make good...  Blind boxes, they're called.  They make good salaries, these guys.  So they probably have newer vehicles where their factory installs of satellite radio.  Do you honestly believe they are trolling through all of those fucking commercials that 
[04:09:00]  they can't stand, or they're listening to satellite, listening to the music they want  to hear, or the talk they want to hear?  Mm-hmm.  They're such hypocrites.  So fast forward to the present.  Now we got a hold of some of the free radio ads by celebrities.  Now they're getting the celebrities on board.  At first it was just monotone guys saying...  Well, just to follow, at first they accepted all the satellite radio ads, and now satellite  radio has become something.  Now they're like, oh, fuck.  We got to make anti-satellite radio ads. 
[04:09:30]  Dummies.  It really is funny when you look at the whole big picture here.  They could have taken out a couple steps there, you know?  Just ignore.  The key is to just ignore it.  That's what they should have done, is just completely ignore satellite radio ads.  Yes.  But they actually helped this business grow.  They certainly did.  Thank you.  They probably sped it along, who knows, maybe six to eight months, you know?  It probably grew that much faster because of what commercial radio was doing.  It's just like being on stage at Caroline's, and then behind you, they have a banner for 
[04:10:00]  some other club right down the street.  Another club that's convenient, right there, better.  Yeah.  Where the comedians are uncensored.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And you can go see whatever comedian you want to hear.  Right.  Yeah, you just walk in.  And in between my act, it would just stop, and there would just be, I don't know, some  sort of intermission.  Yeah, it's like saying the waitresses are hotter, showing more cleavage, there's more booze  than your drinks, if you're lucky, you'll get two for one, you know?  All right, here's Bon Jovi talking about free radio. 
[04:10:30]  Before we saw a million faces and rocked them all, before we could sell out Giant Stadium,  Moscow's Lennon Stadium, or London's Wembley Stadium, before we could close down Times Square  just to play for a half a million people, before my band became a household name, before  we sold more than a hundred million albums, you heard Bon Jovi on the radio.  That's because when they made it, there was no satellite radio, you fucking idiot. 
[04:11:00]  Is that a good thing?  I don't know what that means.  It doesn't mean anything.  I don't know what that means.  They're just so stupid in commercial radio.  What does that mean?  Before we discovered a gold rush in California, we rode a Conestoga wagon across the country.  Yeah.  And?  What are they trying to...  There's planes now.  What are they trying to accomplish with these ads?  What does it mean?  They're making it seem like Bon Jovi had the option. 
[04:11:30]  Do you want to be on free radio or...  Satellite radio didn't exist...  No.  ...during the slippery when wet days...  Right.  ...of 1986, maybe?  And here, just because, you know, everywhere you look, there's hypocrisy.  Derek hit it.  Hi, this is Jon Bon Jovi, and I'm proud to be one of the 5 million subscribers to the  XM Nation.  Wait a minute.  Come on, Jon.  What is it? 
[04:12:00]  Make a stand, man.  Jon.  We love Jon Bon Jovi.  Make a stand.  What is he...  Jon.  What is it, man?  That is...  He is completely on both ends of the spectrum on that one.  You have to be.  And I'm proud.  But you know what you have to be as the artist?  Anything.  Wherever they're playing your shit, man.  Right.  Wherever they're playing your shit, you've got to smooch that ass.  I've never gotten involved in feuds between different comedy clubs. 
[04:12:30]  Like, if you play this club, you play that.  No.  Yeah.  Right.  That's your fight.  Yeah.  Just lick it.  Lick the ass.  There's the XM ass and the free radio ass.  Lick them both.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM. </pre>
