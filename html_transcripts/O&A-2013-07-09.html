<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie recounting a grueling drive to and from a beach house, contrasting his current driving fatigue with his past enjoyment of long trips.  He described listening to the "Morning Mashup" radio show, ironically praising its inoffensive, repetitive nature despite his usual musical preferences.  The bulk of the show then centered on an extensive analysis of the George Zimmerman trial.  Opie and Anthony dissected the evidence – witness testimonies, the 911 call audio, Zimmerman's actions, and the self-defense/stand-your-ground legal arguments – offering their opinions and critiques, frequently using strong language and expressing skepticism towards the prosecution.  Caller Dan contributed to this discussion, offering his perspective on Zimmerman's perceived inconsistencies.  The hosts also criticized media coverage, particularly Nancy Grace and a news segment featuring a panel they deemed "six complete retards," and commented on Jenny Hutt's takes on the trial.  While the racial aspects were touched upon, the main focus remained on the legal and evidentiary aspects of the case. One host offered a "motherly" perspective, acknowledging compassion but admitting it would hinder her ability to be an impartial juror.


The show transitioned into a critique of various popular songs, specifically expressing distaste for those emulating Jay-Z and Beyoncé, preferring originality.  A protracted attempt to identify a song, eventually revealed to be "Boogie" by Jesse Malay, led to further vulgar jokes.  The conversation then shifted to John Mayer, his public image, his relationship with Katy Perry, and ultimately to personal anecdotes, including a detailed description of one host's masturbation experience.  Further topics included the sale of North West's baby photos, a funny gas station fire video, and a bizarre juxtaposition of the prancercise lady's fitness video with John Mayer's music.


A lengthy segment followed dedicated to Andrew Dice Clay, exploring his career, controversies (including the infamous SNL incident with Nora Dunn and Sinead O'Connor), comedic style, and past racist jokes.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes and opinions regarding his career and material, including a past offer of friendship from Sam Kinison.  This led to a discussion about an online feud between Dice Clay and Kinison, fueled by early career rivalry, including a story about steak theft.  Kenny, a former Kinison employee, described the challenges of working for him due to Kinison's cocaine use.  The hosts also recounted Dice Clay's infamous MTV Music Awards appearance and Dick Clark's subsequent apology.  They lamented the scarcity of old TV show clips online, contrasting it with the abundance of kitten videos.


The show then mentioned that best-selling author Brad Thor was a guest later.  The birthdays of Donald Rumsfeld, O.J. Simpson, Tom Hanks, and Courtney Love were mentioned, with Fred Savage's age sparking a discussion about *The Wonder Years*, its cast (including speculation about Paul Pfeiffer being Marilyn Manson), and other shows like *Happy Days* and *Boy Meets World*.  The hosts quizzed two female interns (born in 1992 and 1994) on their knowledge of 70s and 80s TV shows, highlighting their limited familiarity with shows like *MASH*, *Facts of Life*, *Taxi*, and *MacMillan and Wife*.  Rock Hudson's death from AIDS and its impact on public awareness was also discussed.  A conversation about preparedness for emergencies and "go bags" followed.  Brad Thor then appeared, discussing his book *Hidden Order*, followed by a brief visit from Michael B. Jordan, who promoted *Fruitvale Station*.  A humorous anecdote about Brad Thor's father and a damaged car was shared, alongside a discussion about Thor's go bag and societal collapse scenarios.


The interview with Brad Thor continued, delving into his writing process, political views (criticizing anti-American sentiment in Hollywood and government policies), and advocating for a more self-interested foreign policy.  He discussed the Federal Reserve, 9/11, perceived inconsistencies in American values, and shared anecdotes from his personal life, including his children and his move from Chicago.  Jim Norton participated, sharing frustrations with political hypocrisy.  The conversation included tangents about Alec Baldwin, Nick Cannon, and Mariah Carey, as well as promotion of Norton's upcoming shows.  The hosts also discussed balancing work and family life, and the segment concluded with a discussion of the Gathering of the Juggalos, with Norton expressing his intent to attend.


The final segment began with a discussion of Mariah Carey's iconic status and a "best American artist" award.  Listener calls followed: Richard from LA offered restaurant connections, requesting an Opie Sudoku puzzle; Sean from Alabama shared his 16-year anniversary (since age 12), prompting a humorous exchange about anal sex from Opie.  A Dollar Shave Club ad aired.  The conversation then shifted to JWoww's hacked Twitter account, featuring a swastika and leaked phone numbers, leading to a discussion about the downsides of fame and online harassment.  An incident involving Roland's compromised Twitter account was also mentioned.  The segment focused on a tweet by Eric, a show staffer, who wished ill upon the *Morning Joe* hosts after the Oklahoma tornado.  The appropriateness of his tweet was debated by listeners and the hosts, with Eric explaining his frustration with the show's coverage.  The discussion circled back to free speech, the consequences of public statements, and differing perspectives on Eric's actions.  The show concluded with Opie and Anthony signing off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Europese Central Bank legte den Referent.  I hope you get all in my mind.  This is the Opian Anthony Channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opian Anthony Show with Opian.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio. 
[00:00:30]  So shut the fuck up.  And Anthony?  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  He ain't getting over here.  It only is a day over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do that. 
[00:01:00]  Oh my goodness.  We just did this.  Right?  What happened?  I don't know.  I thought I just took a little nap.  Good morning, everybody.  Noises.  Two for Tuesday.  Oh, it is.  Start with some skitters.  Give me back my bullets.  On the old stage.  Can I really rise?  Oh my god. 
[00:01:30]  Last I left you, I drove 90 miles back to a beach house.  Oh, right.  Just to pick up my family to drive another 90 miles back to Manhattan.  Wow.  Holy fuck-a-rooney, am I tired?  That's a lot of driving.  I'm too old for that shit.  That's a lot of driving.  That's the one thing that goes when you get older.  Yeah.  You can't handle a little driving.  Oh, yeah.  We used to drive back and forth to Boston like it was nothing.  Oh, every week. 
[00:02:00]  Remember we would drive, because that asshole would make us work six days a week, so we would  have to start our drive to New York around, I'm trying to remember, one in the afternoon,  two in the afternoon.  On Saturday, we'd go down to Long Island, party our asses off, see our families, and then  pop back in a car Sunday afternoon to go back up.  Or sometimes we would leave for Monday.  I'd come up Monday morning, because we were doing afternoons.  But, yeah, and traffic.  And now a little driving, my back hurts, I'm fucking tired, just a mess. 
[00:02:30]  I just, I find myself, when I'm driving, just looking at the road, the clock, and the  odometer.  Yeah.  Am I doing good?  Oh, my God.  Am I making good time?  And that GPS.  Yeah.  Let's think about the GPS for a second.  Put your mind on autopilot.  Let's think about the GPS for a second.  Yeah.  How slow do those miles go?  When you go, oh, all right, only 50 miles to go.  And then you're like, all right, I'm not going to look again until I go under that overpass. 
[00:03:00]  I don't look.  Then you look three times before you even get to the overpass.  I've only gone four miles.  And it takes down one mile.  Like, what?  What the fuck is this?  I am not long drive guy.  No.  I used to love it.  I hate the monotony of it, you know?  Yeah.  I like getting where I gotta be.  And what show got me through all that driving yesterday? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, Sam Roberts after show?  Sam Roberts.  I'm sorry I blew you off because I don't have our channel in my car still.  I just don't have our channel.  So I can't even keep tabs on you.  That was a good show yesterday.  Don't worry.  I listened to them just waxing fantastic about insane clown posse.  Oh, wow.  Holy mother of fuck.  For how long?  How long did that go on?  It went on for a while.  But my show that got me through the driving, and it's going to hurt to say this, but I have  to be honest with myself here, was the morning mashup. 
[00:04:00]  They are a terrific radio show, I have to say.  What?  All right.  Where's this going?  Nowhere.  That's the sad part.  I was fully enjoying the hit songs and their little banter.  Maybe I was really tired.  You liked their banter?  Maybe I was so tired that I couldn't focus on anything for more than 10 seconds, so it  was perfect for me.  Do you got an example of some banter?  Or, I don't know, they do their Sleepy Monday song. 
[00:04:30]  What?  Kenny would know all this.  Of course he would.  Sleepy Monday.  No, how did it go again?  I don't know.  And then every song is about Gucci's and Versace's and being like fucking a rock star and being  number one.  What?  I don't know.  And then some of the songs were catchy.  Did you like it, or was it just because compared to what you were doing, it was okay?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is it like being in a concentration camp and enjoying Porridge Tuesdays? 
[00:05:00]  See, I normally would go to maybe the Grateful Dead channel or Pearl Jam when I'm driving,  but man, I needed like, I needed like fucking this yesterday.  Yeah.  Just quick hits.  Things moving by fast.  ADD radio?  I did.  They're good though.  Yeah?  Yeah, they're pretty polished.  They've been doing it a while, those guys.  Who produces that broadcast over there?  I don't know.  Kid Kelly?  But they all take turns being the lead. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's like boom, boom, boom.  Well, they all fucking leave to get a drink and take a piss together, so I assume.  And I guess Stanley had to do some raking over the 4th of July weekend.  Good raking story then.  Over and over again, but I enjoyed it.  And then they're like, now the Stanley raking picture's up on our Facebook page.  And they kept going back to it.  I was a little jealous.  Come on.  We have so many throwaway things we just talk about. 
[00:06:00]  But with them, man, one little, dare I say, nugget.  One little nugget could just.  A mash-up nugget?  They could ride that for hours on their show.  Yeah.  You know, a mash-up.  Nicole's like, is the raking picture up on our Facebook page yet?  Not yet.  Okay, I can't wait for you guys to see it.  And then it pops up there, and then they start laughing and howling.  Oh, Stanley, you've got a big backyard.  What is that, a plantation?  Oh, boy. 
[00:06:30]  Here's like, yeah.  And then they go back into a song.  Selena Gomez.  Right.  And they talk about talking in their sleep and drinking too much beer and barbecues.  All the fun stuff people do on the 4th of July weekend.  All that little banter that people go, yeah, oh.  But I, I, I.  All safe?  Very safe?  Very safe.  You're not going to get any fucking, like, hey, motherfuckers?  No.  Nothing like that, right?  They were talking about Nicole's Talons, though. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, no.  So the whole Talon thing has, Talons thing has made it to their show.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I guess the kids couldn't make s'mores because they didn't have the little sticky sticks.  Sticky sticks, sticks, sticks, sticks, sticks.  So one of the dudes said, you should have used your talons to make the s'mores.  That is, ew.  Disgusting.  Giant fucking velociraptor feet.  Yeah.  And I was telling you right before the show, I got a lot of 12 and 13 year olds in my world  these days because my, uh, my, my siblings' kids are around that age and then they have 
[00:07:30]  their friends and, uh, man, I'm going to sound like that guy, but I, these kids, they don't,  they don't live their lives anymore.  These kids these days.  I have this.  Did you shake your fist at them?  I have this nice house out there, you know, with a lovely view and a nice beach and the  ocean's right there.  And these kids didn't go outside the entire time.  They wanted to come to the beach house and check it out. 
[00:08:00]  So I'm like, yeah, sure.  You know, it's pretty much an open house for, you know, family and friends.  Yeah.  One reason why we did it.  And, uh, they laid around the entire time I was there yesterday on the couch, just like  Instagramming and tweeting, but not enjoying what was in front of them.  And I found that weird because I do a lot of social networking.  Obviously you do.  We all do.  The people that listen to this show does, you know, but it seems like it's in a whole  nother fucking place with the younger, uh, people.  Are you saying you, we almost stood there and said, why don't you kids go out? 
[00:08:30]  It's nice outside.  I kind of did.  Oh boy.  I kind of did.  But I think that's always been a thing.  We did go out a lot as kids because, you know, I'd be out there riding the bikes, going  into the woods, shit like that.  But, um, I think if you're just saying, Hey kids, why don't you, oh boy.  Yeah.  But then we were talking about it on the way back to the city and, you know, we've talked  about on this radio show a lot where if you drive around a neighborhood, just any fucking  who gives a fuck neighborhood, you don't, you don't see kids anymore. 
[00:09:00]  And it's not because parents are scared of like predators.  It's because the kids are now fucking, they're inside.  They have fun shit to do inside.  There's a lot of really fun shit now.  We didn't have fun stuff to do inside?  No, on that level.  Not where we can interact with other kids.  Computers and Xbox.  Xbox.  Fucking PlayStation.  Fuck, man.  It's way better than running around in a yard.  Fuck yeah.  Would you, fuck yeah.  If you were coming up now, you think you would, you would just say fuck the yard?  I still just stay in my house a lot of the time, but I, yeah, if I had like an Xbox as 
[00:09:30]  a kid, I would never leave.  What the fuck am I going outside for?  Like dumb friends.  But then I went on some of their Instagrams and I'm like, wow, man, these, these kids look  like, excuse me, they're living a, you know, a life.  Yeah.  But what they do is they, they went to the house yesterday.  They, they got that one cool picture and then they threw it on, on their Instagram and  they're all like, yeah, man, I'm at my beach house.  It's their, it's their beach house.  Yeah.  I'm at my beach house, man. 
[00:10:00]  And then I look at the same person that Instagram, that picture and they're just like on the couch  consuming.  Just consuming.  So where are we living?  There's people that create and then there's other people that have no desire to create  or help out.  They just want to consume.  Oh, you got any more snacks allowed?  Whoa.  They really annoy you, don't they?  People in general do. 
[00:10:30]  I think Travis said, we're all heading toward a world like Wally.  You guys saw Wally, right?  Where it just, just sit around and just consume, man.  That's it.  I don't even know what these kids, they've been in my life, their, their entire lives.  I don't even know what they want to do with their lives.  What do you want to do with your life?  I want to rock.  And the only reason why I bring it up, I don't think it's my, my, uh, family in particular.  I think this is really what's going on out there.  I have no idea what, what their dreams are, what they're like, like what they're working 
[00:11:00]  for.  Like when we all grew up, we, whether it worked out or not, we all had like, I want to be  this.  You just, you know what I mean?  And, and, and, and you picked something.  Oh, but I'm sure they do.  They're just not telling you.  They're not telling the old guy walking around the house.  Well, the old guy's paying the fucking bills.  That's just it too.  All right.  I pay the bills around there.  You tell me what you're doing with your life.  Oh God.  You know, you ought to do this or it's endearing you to them.  Go like this.  Fah! 
[00:11:30]  Throw your hands up.  Fah!  Fah!  I guess you're right to a point.  Yeah.  It was disturbing though.  I don't know.  I mean, cause I know.  Well, when I was, when we were growing up, we had, we were lucky enough to have our grandma's  beach house in Waiting River.  And man, I'm trying to think if, if, uh, we had our smartphones back then, if we really  would have stayed inside, there was so much fun, so much stuff to do on the beach.  Then it's fucking running around degrees in there.  Probably there was no air conditioning, right? 
[00:12:00]  In my house.  Yeah.  Oh God.  You know, it was old school.  And being in the house was the worst, worst thing possible.  Yeah.  Just listening to fucking old people babbling.  Oh.  You gotta get out.  You had to.  Yeah.  Now they have stuff that just, if I could have been in the house and interacted with kids  all over the place, I probably would have stayed there.  Right.  Or I would have stayed in the house 50% more than I did.  Yeah.  Every time you go out, you don't do anything anyway.  Yeah.  Just sit there and fucking, you fucking throw berries at the retarded kid.  That's what we did.  We'd throw berries at the, the weakest kids. 
[00:12:30]  You know what I, you know what I did?  People threw berries at me.  Fuck.  Wait a minute.  I don't know.  I, I just assumed there would be some kind of like a combo of the two.  And.  They just had no desire to go outside.  I'm like, why are you even here then?  Do this shit from your couch.  You really gotta think.  You, you know, you know, you're kind of out of that loop.  And then, you know, and then they're eating snacks and just throwing like the wrappers  on the floor.  I'm like, this is my home.  Oh no.  Oh no. 
[00:13:00]  They weren't respecting the property.  Not at all.  Oh my God.  I don't know.  You wanted to say something kind of harsh.  I'm so bummed.  I picked the spot I picked.  Why?  Next year, it's going to be a place that is a little harder to drive to.  Oh, it's a little too easy to get to.  Way too easy for way too many.  I had my team of Mexicans over yesterday cleaning up from the party. 
[00:13:30]  So, but I never like.  What, Jimmy?  I'm going to laugh at that.  Kung fu.  But I don't even think about it.  I just know that they're coming in, so I don't even care.  The Mexicans.  There's shit laying all over the place and, you know, things.  I'll just be like, ah, cleaning crew will get it.  That's all.  I don't care.  Hey, why did the phone... 
[00:14:00]  Look what...  What happened?  Fat!  Yeah, fat!  What happened to the phone thing?  Half the phone thing went away.  Oh, all right.  What?  So, this guy can't believe that someone actually stuck up for Trayvon Martin yesterday?  Fez stuck up for Trayvon Martin yesterday?  I can't believe one.  Well, good for him.  There's people that are sticking up for Trayvon Martin as well.  Yo, Trayvon.  Yeah, but I think Fezzy's take on it was a little emotional, more than factual.  What did he say? 
[00:14:30]  I don't really listen to the...  No, I don't think he liked the big...  I listen to the morning mashup.  Morning mashup style.  I don't think he liked the big bad guy with the gun that was shooting the infant that was  crawling on the sidewalk with his whoopee and his fucking thing in his mouth.  Is he crying over the whole thing?  Did he cry?  Not that I heard, but I've heard very little, so there's still a great chance that he cried.  I don't like that.  I don't think anybody's attacking Trayvon Martin.  Like, I just...  Yeah, there are people attacking Trayvon Martin. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, I don't...  I kind of go back and forth between wanting to see Zimmerman acquitted and convicted, depending  on what day...  The only reason I have any empathy for Zimmerman, excuse me, Anthony, is the case you make  is the only reason I'm like, eh, maybe, you know...  Yeah.  But, I mean, can't we just...  The more that comes out, my feelings change.  As the trial goes on, yeah, people are like, oh, yeah, okay, well, that little tidbit,  ooh, ooh, the prosecution scores.  Don't forget the human emotion factor.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think they've approved their case whatsoever, but then you've got the jury 
[00:15:30]  with their human emotions and stuff.  That's always...  I think that, too, that's...  That's not a guarantee that they're going to be able to push their own human emotions down.  The juries are always, you know, that loose cannon, the fucking thing, you know, you're  not sure what's going to happen.  But this is so cut and dry, it's going to be very hard for them to just look at the letter  of the law, the statutes for murder two, which is totally ridiculous, and even the statutes 
[00:16:00]  for manslaughter and the justification for manslaughter in certain situations, which this  falls into.  If you look at those, just the letter of the law there, it's not even close.  I mean, it's...  You take away all that bullshit, and that's what they have to consider.  And it's very hard, even with emotion.  You've seen jurors before in other cases go, look, I would have loved to have said guilty,  I would have loved to this, we were crying in the fucking jury room, but we had to look 
[00:16:30]  at this and this, and that's what the law told us we had to do.  And that's where they are right now at this fucking case.  But in a perfect world, that makes sense, but there's always some weird shit that happens  in those jurors.  Of course, you never know, if we all knew, we'd know.  Right, yeah, of course.  But at this point, yeah, it's going to be up to the jury probably, maybe Thursday they  might get it, Friday, end of the week, they might stretch it out to the end of the week.  Wow, really?  Oh yeah, they went through probably nine witnesses yesterday, the defense. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, wow.  And yeah, it just kind of looks like they're getting through this part of it really quickly,  the defenses.  Well, I would have loved to watch the trial yesterday, but the kids were watching Dr.  Phil as they were fucking checking their Instagrams.  And what were they?  Let me consume some TV now.  Were they eating candy and stuff?  Everything.  I don't know how they don't, because we were discussing that.  It was so weird, it was a weird discussion on the way home, because I was trying to wrap my  head around it, and then my wife goes, look, when you were growing up, they just didn't 
[00:17:30]  have this shit.  Yeah.  They have so many different treats now, it's unbelievable.  Treats?  What did we have?  Oreos and maybe Captain fucking, uh, Captain Crunch?  That was about it.  And Oreos.  I think that's all we had.  What else did we really have?  The basic chocolate bars.  Candy Kisses were popular.  Yeah, but not a lot of shit.  Oh, Necco wafers, the wax bottles that you'd bite off and drink the colorful liquid out of  it, Pixie Stix, the rolled up licorice that would fucking, you'd put it in your mouth 
[00:18:00]  and make it like a tongue going, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, oh yeah, candy  cigarettes, gum cigarettes, fucking, uh, uh, wax teeth, fucking, there you go.  The one guy looks so much like E-Rock.  Oh, it's E-Rock.  It makes me laugh every time.  That's not the E-Rock guy, though.  Find the E-Rock guy.  Um, well, I mean, my supermarket, there's now two aisles dedicated to cereal alone.  Yeah, a lot of fucking cereals.  How many, we didn't, we had maybe, that's E-Rock, I mean, that's, that's E-Rock. 
[00:18:30]  E-Rock hates it, I know, look, he's really mad now.  Oh, it's not that.  This is your generation's, I walked to school in the snow up the hill, three channels,  no frills, life was hard.  Because he's one of the consumers.  But he's technically right, though, like, it is a generational thing, like, we all, every  generation, E-Rock, I admitted that, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't, I don't, I'm trying  to wrap my head around it, I'm kind of admitting, especially with these guys taking their shots 
[00:19:00]  at me, that, okay, maybe I'm off base here.  No, no, I understand, but it's just, it's become that.  Maybe I'm officially the old guy in the room, which kind of sucks, you never want to be the  old guy in the room, but, but logically, it makes sense to me that maybe you should  go outside and get some fucking air.  Every generation thinks, and this is the way it works, the new generation is softer.  Like, our, our dads thought we were softer, and I'm sure they're, and it goes back, like,  none of us are Vikings.  Like, I'm sure even, like, we think the generation after us is soft, but, like, no one's looking 
[00:19:30]  at us like, boy, these guys ripped shit apart with their bare hands.  They were tough guys.  Hundreds of years ago.  I would never disagree with my dad.  His generation was, they were tough motherfuckers.  Yeah.  I'm talking about guys that, you know, my dad would have been about 80-something now, but those  70-year-old guys and above, those are way tougher guys than we ever were.  But their generation, doesn't it, the generation before them, not at all, because, ah, we fought  World War I.  Yeah, right.  You guys had planes.  Right.  Those World War II guys, you hang out with any of them, man, holy, they will give you a 
[00:20:00]  fight, too.  Nah, they're all curmudgeons.  They'll get a fist fight with those old guys, man.  They'll beat the shit out of you.  Well, they didn't have therapy.  They're all bottled up.  Right.  They had no ability to get it out emotionally.  They're, fuck, they're punching a German guy from 1950.  I completely agree.  Those guys were way fucking tougher.  Yeah.  Completely agree.  What they had to go through, World War II and all that shit, holy fuck.  Build the fucking country?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's a country.  Build it.  Right.  We've still got some builders here and there.  Oh, man. 
[00:20:30]  What were you saying?  So the, um...  The fuck was that?  Oh, I would have loved to have seen the trial.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, all right.  I guess they kicked back up again today, but yesterday, again, pretty big for the defense.  Man, they brought in a bunch of people at first that would just, like, listen to the  911 tape and the screaming in the background and saying, yeah, that's George Zimmerman.  You know, they brought a bunch of friends.  And then the one guy they brought in, it was a pretty compelling witness if you think, 
[00:21:00]  you know, you want to add some emotion in and be like, all right, it's not just the  guy that knows him.  The Vietnam War medic that is good friends with Zimmerman.  And he was talking about how he would hear guys that he would talk to on a daily basis  in that stressful, you know, deadly situation, screaming at him for help.  And he says, yeah, the voice takes this weird high pitch. 
[00:21:30]  And it was just talking, he goes, I do identify that voice as George Zimmerman.  And whether it's accurate, not, but it's just one of those things that kind of was  like, all right, that's a new little take there, new little avenue they're taking on  that whole thing.  The bottom line, though, with the audio tape, it's a wash.  No one absolutely can say whether, just from listening to tape, if it's Trayvon or Zimmerman.  I'm glad he said that.  Well, yeah.  And that's been something from the beginning.  Even the experts, the judge said, no, we're not having experts coming because they can't 
[00:22:00]  determine it.  And I want to say it again, and George Zimmerman sits there and he knows exactly who screamed  that night, which is so fucking creepy.  But now, witness testimony and the situation at hand lends you to think that it's Zimmerman.  I believe it was Zimmerman screaming.  I believe it was Zimmerman, too.  Because I believe that Trayvon was probably in better shape.  And I believe that Trayvon was probably beating him.  I mean, I do believe that.  Don't forget, Zimmerman was in much better shape than he is now.  Than he is now.  Yes, he was.  He looks like, you know, the guy from WALL-E as he sits there in the courtroom. 
[00:22:30]  He looks like a strong consumer these days.  But I believe Keith Robinson said it fast.  He was in pretty good shape back then.  Yes.  He was a bitch-made dude.  A bitch-made dude.  A bitch-made dude.  And we can't give him a lesser charge of just being a douche.  A douche.  It might be douche, too.  I don't really.  He's not getting douche in the first.  I'm not a big fan of George Zimmerman.  What are you, a fan of Trayvon, then?  No, I'm not that connected to this like you are.  No, I was listening to... 
[00:23:00]  But I look at that guy, and I'm like, ugh, there's just something about him.  I am more than Zimmerman, though.  More Trayvon than Zimmerman.  Even though, because of this case, it's kind of, we've had to look at Trayvon Martin under  a microscope.  Yeah.  But in that situation, I don't want to see Zimmerman go to jail for murder, because I  don't think he set out to murder the guy.  And I do believe that he was getting his ass kicked.  Mm-hmm.  Let me ask you this, though.  Was Trayvon Martin standing his ground that night?  We always talk about how Zimmerman had to stand his ground.  He had every opportunity to fucking go home. 
[00:23:30]  He could have gotten his Skittles, his iced tea, and got his fucking ass back to his dad,  and they'd have watched the game together.  Couldn't Zoom and do the same and say, fuck it, I'll just back off a little bit, too?  He could have, but he had called the police.  Does it stand your ground, you know, if Trayvon Martin felt like he was in danger as well?  No, stand your ground has nothing to do with somebody following you or watching you or  anything.  None of those things are illegal.  And the fact that he could have gone home, could Zimmerman just have gone to the store 
[00:24:00]  like he wanted to?  You know, he was on his way to Target.  Yeah, he could have.  But he thought there was a suspicious person in his neighborhood.  He had called the police, you know, and now was waiting for the police and keeping an  eye on where this guy was so he could say, hey, police, he's there.  That's what the evidence shows.  There's no pursuit.  There's no hunting.  There's no stalking.  All these words that I see everyone using for what Zimmerman was doing that night doesn't 
[00:24:30]  fit the case.  Sorry.  It just doesn't.  It's great for the dialogue, for these news fucking whores.  But watching someone is not illegal and it's not grounds for someone to turn around and  punch you in the face, which, again, evidence points to.  The evidence does kind of say that.  That's the unfortunate part.  I do think that I think that Zimmerman, like, you know, we talk about the law of the emotions.  I think that Zimmerman is probably going to be acquitted. 
[00:25:00]  And I think the law doesn't allow for the fact that something should happen to him.  I would love to see.  I don't want to see him go away for 30 years, but I do think that he should go to jail for  something.  I don't I get legally.  I can't say exactly what I think that he was more wrong that night than Trayvon was.  No, I can't see when you when you get punched in the face.  The person that punched you in the face is wrong right there.  It's even if you said, hey, asshole, what the fuck are you doing in this neighborhood? 
[00:25:30]  The guy does not have a right to punch you in the face.  I agree.  Period.  I agree.  And that's the whole case, by the way.  But we also like in just in human interaction, there are those weird moments of threat and  those weird male things that you go through all the time.  And like, like if you if you're coming out of a bar and someone says something to you,  if you have a pistol, you're going to react.  Like, who knows if Zimmerman didn't come up again?  And we don't know if Trayvon said that to him or if he what he said, because that's  what we don't know.  But how do you know he didn't come up and fucking try to alpha male Trayvon where he 
[00:26:00]  never would have if he didn't have that?  It's almost like the guy called yesterday and maybe was legally wrong.  He said the ace in the hole.  There is something for that.  If you walk up to a guy, like if I walk up to a guy who I normally wouldn't be a cocksucker  to because I have a pistol and I and I'm confrontational with him in a way.  That's such a dangerous fucking thing.  And again, the law doesn't and as a gun owner, you don't want you steer clear of situations 
[00:26:30]  that can get you in a in a situation where you then have to use a gun.  You don't want to fucking go through that.  You don't want to use a gun.  And because you have one, people think it makes you braver.  No, it makes you back down from confrontations a lot faster than it would.  You don't want to use the fact that you're armed in a scuffle, an argument, a brawl.  You want to use the fact that you're armed when someone's trying to kill you, period. 
[00:27:00]  You don't because you're you're a different guy.  You're responsible.  You're not George Zimmerman has done nothing in the past to show that he is an irresponsible gun owner.  He's never brandished.  There hasn't been any reports that all these other people that he called the cops on during his tenure as neighborhood watch guy that anyone said, you know, he pulled a gun on me, flashed his gun.  His jacket blew open and I saw a gun.  He's never used his gun as a threatening object whenever he's confronted. 
[00:27:30]  No, no, I know.  I don't mean that.  I'm saying you can't then just assume that maybe he's this crazy guy with a gun.  I don't think he's crazy, but you're a different guy.  You're not get involved in everybody's business and make and be that guy that calls the cops on everybody.  And is that, you know, when you, how many times have you called 911 in the last, you know what I'm saying?  You just called on me.  Exactly.  You're a different person.  For you, that's to behave that way as a wannabe cop is not a comprehensible thing because that's not who you are. 
[00:28:00]  And for a lot of gun owners, that's not who they are.  But there are people who behave a certain way because they have a pistol.  I don't think he wanted to go out and murder people.  But there are guys that he never would have got out of that car at all if he didn't have the pistol.  And I firmly believe that.  I don't think you behave in any different way.  But would you yell, like, do you do anything different?  Not because you have a gun and you're going to shoot somebody. 
[00:28:30]  It's almost like having bigger muscles because you know that at least you're not a target.  Right, right, right.  Would you walk safer or would you take the train now or maybe you wouldn't before because you know you can protect yourself?  I would know there is a knowledge that you walk around with that you know that you can defend yourself in a life-threatening situation.  Of course, yeah.  Not a scuffing, like I said, you're not going to just pull it out and start pistol-whipping somebody.  You've got to be walking around safer.  That's a no-brainer. 
[00:29:00]  Knowing that if that ever presents itself, a deadly threat presents itself, you can at least answer with equal footing.  You know what I mean?  Right.  So, but you can't assume that he's doing something any different.  By the guy he is, just from what I know about him, from all those 911 calls and from how the night turned out, I do think he was doing something different.  And again, I'm not saying I can prove this in court, I'm just talking about as people we kind of, we understand how other people, you've never called 911, you're not that guy, you're not the wannabe cop, you're not the guy looking for power, looking for that respect. 
[00:29:30]  There are guys who are like that, the cops always know who they are, and sometimes they're great citizens, sometimes they're in the middle, and sometimes they become sociopaths.  I don't know which of those things he is, but he's not a guy like you.  You're different people.  No, no, but again, put in that situation, there's Trayvon, he could have gone home, he had ample opportunity to walk down that fucking sidewalk, right through the middle of those two rows of townhouses, and gone back to his dad's house. 
[00:30:00]  He never had to say boo to fucking Zimmerman.  How do we know Zimmerman didn't go, hey, hey, hey, come here, come here, I want to talk to you.  Again, I'm not saying that deserves to get punched, but let's just say that Zimmerman called him over.  Because knowing he's got that ace in the hole.  You could speculate anything.  So that's why it's hard for me.  You can speculate, but there's no witnesses that attest to that, there's any statements that were made. 
[00:30:30]  It's just...  You wouldn't be annoyed if someone was following you, though?  When I get followed, I get fucking annoyed.  You could get annoyed, but I'll tell you what you do.  And then it could easily ramp up.  A lot of times, if I'm walking around, and I feel like I'm being followed, or someone's behind me, and I'm just uncomfortable with it,  I will walk over to the side, like a building or something, I'll put my back to the building and just stand there,  and maybe take my phone out, and make it like I'm looking at my phone, and wait for the person to fucking pass me. 
[00:31:00]  And then I'll continue on my way.  Well, aren't you the perfect human being?  I am.  I don't turn around and say, hey, motherfucker, what do you follow me for, or anything.  Say Trayvon Martin did do that.  Well, some of us have anger problems, Ann, and they can't just sit around and do that.  Others get really annoyed really quickly.  No, you do.  And don't think before they react.  No, Ann's right.  He does that stuff.  No, I've done that stuff in New York.  I had to back the fuck down.  I've had some little issues here and there, when I should have just fucking taken a breath. 
[00:31:30]  No, no, but a lot of times, like, a lot of times, you know, if a car's in the way, you know,  maybe paparazzi jumps out to photograph Michael Buble.  The way to handle it is to move, you mother.  Is to jump on the sidewalk.  No, it's to physically drive the car and push the other car.  Oh, I forgot about that one.  I have pushed a few vehicles with mine, but I was in a hurry.  You know what?  I've got to take back that perfect human being comment.  Right?  I'm taking that one back now.  This guy says you're way off on so much stuff, it's not even funny.  Of course I am.  He might mean me. 
[00:32:00]  You know, it's 50-50.  I've gotten people say you're right, and people say, Ant's 100% right.  You're a faggot.  I mean, you know.  I've got family in Winter Park, and I Google map this Sanford place.  Yeah.  They're a little too close to the action.  Are they?  They're like 20 miles away.  Oh, boy.  I think it's like the next town.  There might be one town in between Sanford and Winter Park.  Tone of batting down the hatches.  They might have to make a New York trip in a week or so.  Yeah.  Dan.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Anthony, you're leaving a lot of fags. 
[00:32:30]  Yep.  All right.  Like what?  First, he's on the 911 tape, and he said he's walking towards him, and he's looking at  him.  But he nowhere talks about on the 911 tape that he circled the car three times.  But yet, later on, he's making that statement elsewhere, like the Sean Hannity.  Oh, he circled my car three times.  But he never said that on the 911 tape.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, he circled the car.  I didn't hear that.  That Trayvon walked around Zimmerman's vehicle like a couple of times. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He said on the 911 tape, he said he's going back to the car and he's looking at me.  And that was it.  Then later on, he made an official police statement.  He circled the car three times.  Dude.  That makes it almost like it's threatening.  And he's adding threatening information in there.  Secondly, I tweeted this to you earlier this weekend.  How did Zimmerman draw the gun?  I saw it.  Your cock is huge.  Yeah.  I'll see.  I'll take a pick.  What?  How did Zimmerman draw the gun? 
[00:33:30]  In a ground-and-pound situation when...  Oh, I've seen...  Look, look.  ...was sitting on the gun.  All right.  Okay.  Hold on.  While he was laying on his back.  All right.  Look, I've seen the reenactments that are done on Headline News with, oh, no bias whatsoever.  It's amazing.  They sit a guy.  They have a guy laying on his back.  They sit a guy straddling the guy laying on his back.  And then the guy goes, okay, now he's in this position.  And he'll lean over and put his fists over the face.  He'll go, all right, now freeze! 
[00:34:00]  How is he going to grab his gun?  They never move.  In a fluid fight situation, they're squirming and pushing and shoving it.  Arms are moving and flailing.  Legs are moving.  If you want to get to your gun, you skirt, you pull down, you fucking push your arm down.  They never show a struggle.  How about they get the guy, straddle him, get the guy on the bottom, put a prop gun in a holster,  and they'll say, dude, get the gun out of the holster.  And then we'll see how people move in a fight situation. 
[00:34:30]  How much blood spatter did he have on him?  Hold on.  How much blood spatter did Zimmerman have on him?  Blood spatter from himself?  No, no, no, from when he shot Trayvon.  Not a lot.  Almost none.  It went in.  It didn't bleed a lot at all.  It bled through the first shirt he had on against his body, but the hoodie really didn't get any.  What did you shoot him in the stomach?  Chest?  Chest.  Yeah, chest right through the heart.  Boom. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Get him.  Why didn't he just shoot him in the leg or something, man?  All right.  Let's go with Zimmerman's words.  Okay.  While he was spinning his head fast and pounded six times in 40 seconds,  then he swarmed down to get his head off the concrete, which put the gun behind Trayvon Martin.  Okay?  He still couldn't have drawn the gun.  No, he could have because he did.  What do you think he did?  What do I think he did?  Yeah.  I think when he got into that dark area and he was following him to see what he was doing, 
[00:35:30]  he pulled the gun out in the dark area because he was scared.  Trayvon Martin knew that he was going to get shot either way, so he struck him.  He hit his head on the concrete when he went down.  Trayvon Martin was jumping down.  The witness, Mr. Good, said hands were going in a downward motion.  Could you see this?  No.  Could you see anybody hitting anybody?  No.  I think they were fighting for the gun, and that's why, I'll even say Zimmerman was screaming.  But he was screaming because he knew he was fighting for his life because Trayvon Martin 
[00:36:00]  was going to take that gun from him.  And that's how Trayvon, that's how the gun got drawn.  It was already drawn when he came up to Trayvon Martin.  Oh, and, uh, so how, where's that evidence?  Where's the evidence that it didn't happen?  Do you keep saying there's no evidence that it happened?  See, see, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, the prosecution has to come up with  the evidence that something happened.  You can't say, well, where's the evidence that it didn't happen?  You don't need it. 
[00:36:30]  Here's the deal.  Zimmerman has a story.  Zimmerman has a story.  The defense has, uh, their evidence that that's the story that happened.  The prosecution has to disprove Zimmerman's story.  Do you understand that?  They can't come up with speculation.  They need evidence.  Evidence that will make, yes, they do, that will make the jury say, wow, Zimmerman's got  this story.  But let me tell you something.  The prosecution disproved all of that and proved that this is what happened beyond a 
[00:37:00]  reasonable doubt, so I gotta convict this guy.  It hasn't happened.  He's walking.  Get, get, get through your fucking heads.  And then you hang up, bro.  I didn't hang up.  Oh, okay, you got real quiet, real fast.  We're giving you an opportunity to talk.  I'm amazing.  Zimmerman does have a story.  He has seven different stories.  It's a seven...  Wow.  Oh, God. 
[00:37:30]  Let me, let me ask you a question.  There's not.  What's the car circling thing?  Like, he said that Zimmerman said he was in the car, and Trayvon circled his car three  times?  Yes, it was on the, it was when they interviewed him that night, so, um, after, after the shooting  and the police interviewed him.  And he's saying that...  He didn't say he circled three times either.  He said, oh, he's circling around, or he's circled around.  And there isn't this definite, he's fucking walking around the car three times.  Wait, is he saying he got out of the car after Trayvon was circling around it? 
[00:38:00]  And I'd love to know this, uh, this seven different stories.  Wait, he said, he said that, he said Trayvon was circling his car, and then he got out anyway?  He, he said, Trayvon, he said he's approaching my car now.  I was on a 911 station.  After he went off, Zimmerman didn't get out of the car until after Trayvon took off.  Right, and he was walking towards his dad's house.  He was going towards his house.  So he, and if he kept going, he'd have been home. 
[00:38:30]  Why did he...  That's what you said.  Why?  You said you would stop and put your back against the wall.  That's probably...  Oh, stop it.  He's being followed.  But if, let me ask you, if, if the guy, if he felt this guy comes and circles his car  or whatever, and it's, you know, a young black dude in a hoodie, so he's profiling him as  probably a criminal.  Right.  Why does Zimmerman get out of the car and, and do anything, whereas if he, if he didn't  have a pistol, do you really think he gets out of that car?  Maybe not.  Maybe you're right. 
[00:39:00]  Maybe not.  But again, what does that even mean at this point?  What does it even mean?  And I'm going to make my last point, my very last point, and then I'll get off the phone  It's your first one, if you ask me.  Even you, Anthony, I love you guys.  I love listening to y'all.  They're a great show.  But my last point is, do you think you like Deshaun Hannity?  In what, in what way?  Where?  Not knowing what the self-defense law was in Florida.  No, he said he, here it is.  He didn't say, I don't know what the self-defense law is. 
[00:39:30]  He said, he was asked, have you ever heard of Stand Your Ground?  He goes, no, never heard of Stand Your Ground.  He didn't say, I don't know, this is self-defense laws.  And then they tried nailing him with that by bringing his fucking teacher on about that.  And even the teacher said, no, I never used the words Stand Your Ground.  It's a semantics thing, of course, that is being called in more distractions and static  from the actual case, which is, if he's getting his face beaten, and in that moment, he feels 
[00:40:00]  his life is being threatened, or great bodily harm is being threatened, he can then respond  with deadly physical force.  Period.  Period.  So when you, so when you are going through your CCW class, you don't know, you don't  learn what the self-defense laws are in the state that you're getting your CCW?  I think he had just answered that other thing.  He was just, he did understand it.  It was just a semantics.  He gave an honest answer to a semantics thing.  He may not have known the title of it.  And by the way, in New York, you don't even have to take a course.  How about that? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, in Florida, you have to take a course.  And everybody since 2006 has known it's been called Stand Your Ground.  It's new to y'all because you're outside of the city.  No, it's called, it's not even called, it's called the Castle Doctrine.  It's not even called Stand Your Ground.  So, you know, again, prove it.  Prove it.  Well, I appreciate you taking my call.  All right.  It was a pleasure talking to you.  All right, Dan.  Of course it was.  Thank you, sir.  The prosecution, I'm just saying, look, it's not a pleasant thought, but the prosecution 
[00:41:00]  hasn't proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that anything different happened than what  Zimmerman's story is.  Are there inconsistencies?  Yeah.  There are in every fucking story that anyone's ever told.  There's going to be inconsistencies.  Are they important inconsistencies that a jury's going to look at and say, wow, this  guy is not a credible witness.  He's a combative defendant.  He's changed his story.  No, there's just not that going on in this trial. 
[00:41:30]  Well, the problem is we don't really have Trayvon Martin's story.  Well, that's what forensics are for.  Makes it tough.  Evidence is for.  That's what witness statements are for.  I understand that.  Speak for the dead guy.  But, again, yeah, well, that's a lot we don't know.  That's how life and death works.  I understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Puts the other side in a power position, though.  I'm just telling you, he is walking away from this.  Well, I see it that way, too.  Not even manslaughter.  He's fucking walking scot-free away from this fucking charge. 
[00:42:00]  Human emotion with the jury, though.  Let's see what happens.  Oh, it's human emotion with fucking...  Just go to hashtag justice for Trayvon.  Holy fuck.  There's a bunch of people that really have not even looked at one iota of the case and  have a very strong opinion of what should happen and what will happen if he's acquitted.  Which include things like George Zimmerman's death, his rape, his murder of him and his 
[00:42:30]  family, riots, killing of indiscriminate white or Hispanic people.  It's amazing to read.  And I thought we had haters.  My God.  Right?  Those are some haters.  Wow.  I'm gonna kill you!  All right.  All right.  At least we got that done early.  It's a big case.  It is huge.  Everyone's talking about it.  All the news channels are just playing it ad nauseum.  That Nancy Grace really is a pig. 
[00:43:00]  She's a despicable fuckwad.  What a fucking pig she is.  Mr. Rock?  I was looking at your Twitter last night and I noticed you were watching Dr. Drew.  Yes.  And at one point I flip it on and my wife goes, is he just purposely making himself mad by  watching this?  Yes, we all know that.  That's what Anthony does.  I put on Seinfeld.  No, you search out anger now.  No, I had to see fucking Jenny Hutt.  Yeah.  I had to see Jenny Hutt talking on...  How did she do last night?  She is a dunce. 
[00:43:30]  She is?  A dummy.  Dr. Drew loves her.  She knows that...  Or she's saying, I think he's gonna be acquitted.  But, you know, I don't like him and I don't agree with it.  And she was saying how Trayvon was running away and he was scared that night.  A scared person running away.  His house was literally by the office.  He needed to get to a little further than our office from here.  He was walking that way. 
[00:44:00]  When you hear George Zimmerman say, all right, he just took off.  And then you hear the door open and then the 911 operator, whatever it is, a non-emergency  guy, says, are you following him?  He goes, yeah.  He goes, all right, we don't need you to do that.  And then Zimmerman is walking.  He's walking this way, which I'm pointing forward, a 90 degree angle to that path that  Trayvon walked down.  He's walking this way.  He's not turning. 
[00:44:30]  So Zimmerman walks this way.  Now, you're telling me not enough time for him?  He's scared and running to get his ass home?  No.  Zimmerman walks to get the street at the end of that sidewalk by the T.  They tell him we don't need you to do that.  He goes, okay.  He starts walking back to his vehicle.  Trayvon is now at the T, waiting for him.  Hey, you got a problem?  What do you do?  You following me?  The exchange they had.  Why didn't Trayvon keep walking down that fucking way and go home? 
[00:45:00]  That's too logical.  Because people get pissed off when they're getting followed and stuff.  Pissed off?  There you go.  I'm not saying Zimmerman's wrong for what he did, but it's not as easy as saying he should  have just went home.  A lot of people go, what the fuck are you doing?  And the guy's on the phone.  We all have done that shit.  Trayvon sees him.  He's following me.  He's on the phone, too.  Yeah, it would be very easy for him just to walk to his house.  But then you feel less of a man, like this guy got the best of you.  It happens all the time is what I'm saying. 
[00:45:30]  Sorry there's part of certain people's culture that doesn't allow you to fucking just go home.  You got to punch someone in the face.  Sorry.  Well, all the flip side are there are certain people that would behave, will, again, like  getting beer muscles.  He behaved a certain way because he knew he had a pistol.  And again, I might do the same thing.  And Trayvon behaved a certain way because he thought he didn't.  Because he thought he didn't have a pistol.  So he punches him in the face and fucking, oops, oopsie, it's an armed citizen. 
[00:46:00]  Gee, that's the one in a million shot I sure didn't want.  See, I would agree with that.  If they had just bumped, the problem I have with it is simply Zimmerman, I know, got out  of that car because he had a pistol.  And the thing was, make the phone call and then stay in the fucking car.  But do you think he got out of the car because he had the pistol, because he wanted to use  it and shoot Trayvon?  Do you think that night, on his way to Target, he sees a guy and goes, yeah, I think I'm going 
[00:46:30]  to just throw everything away and shoot some guy tonight.  I say no.  No, but I don't think it's as cut and dry as did he want to shoot somebody or, no, I  think there's somewhere in between.  Well, had he not made all those other 911 calls?  When you call 911 that many times about the same thing.  But that's his, that was his job on putting quotations around.  But that's also who he is.  That's his identity.  He's sick and tired of this shit going on.  Right.  And he's going to put a stop to it. 
[00:47:00]  Now, I'm not saying he's going out to murder somebody, but he's in a different frame of  mind than, I think, an average citizen who just sees somebody walking and calls the cops  and goes, that guy looks at him.  This guy was somewhere between a regular citizen and a cop.  And he, again, had those 911 calls not been made, I would feel differently about it.  But he's that guy.  Yeah.  He's the, it's almost like, you know, if you're the guy who's always walking up to  women and going, hey, hey, hey, if you're the guy who's always fucking approaching strange 
[00:47:30]  women on the sidewalk, and then one time you have a confrontation with a woman and she  scratches your face and you knock her teeth out, and you're like, well, she knocked my  teeth out.  And you're like, yeah, but there's something about you.  You're the guy that every time is approaching them.  We know something about you.  He's different than, than just a guy who set out to murder somebody, but he's not just  a regular guy.  There's a fucking, there's something about him that's buggy.  And I'm not saying it'd be proven, but he's a different dude than just an average citizen 
[00:48:00]  going home.  He, do I think he wanted to possibly have a confrontation?  Yeah.  Because he's sick of it.  He's a guy who's fucking tired of it.  He's tired of these fucking spooks coming into his neighborhood.  And I'm telling you, he didn't say that in the tape, but you know, that mentality doesn't  mean I think he's a racist, but he's just tired of these fucking kids coming in and  causing a problem.  And he's going to fucking do something.  And come on, man, you don't make that many.  I haven't called 9-1-1 more than once following a bus.  But you can't throw him in jail for all that. 
[00:48:30]  I'm not saying that, but he was the neighborhood watch guy.  Calling 9-1-1 is part of his job as the neighborhood watch guy.  But again, you're right.  But he makes himself that guy.  But he gets out of the car.  And what's so bad about making yourself the guy that, you know, all right, we've had 12  robberies in this fucking neighborhood.  All of them fit this fucking MO of, you know, here's another black male and a hoodie.  I'm going to call the cops. 
[00:49:00]  What's so bad about that?  Everyone's made it a bad thing.  I'll tell you what's so bad about it.  Under most circumstances, nothing.  It's responsible citizens taking charge of their own neighborhood and not letting fucking  creeps come.  But you know what I mean?  Not letting creeps come in and rob good citizens.  What makes it bad is there is that really weird point of no return that I think a really  qualified person or a cop knows how to navigate much better than him.  I'll never say no mistakes are made. 
[00:49:30]  I'll never say his actions couldn't have stopped everything in its tracks if he would  just would have turned around and gone back to his truck.  Of course.  And hindsight is beautiful when it comes to pointing those things out.  Again, I could point it out by saying Trayvon should have kept marching his ass back to  his house.  I mean, it's one of those perfect storm things that happens and you get that.  But the case itself, the murder too, even the manslaughter, the things the jury has to 
[00:50:00]  consider has nothing to do with those peripheral things.  Him getting out of the vehicle.  It all builds up to a point.  But that one point of him getting beaten, him wondering, I think this motherfucker is  going to kill me.  I honestly think I'm going to die here.  Legally, again, I'm not saying that he's going to go to, but it's like if a guy molests  a kid and the kid says something and yeah, you know, but there's not enough physical evidence 
[00:50:30]  to throw the guy away.  But everybody knows this is the guy in the, again, now that's a little, I'm raising it  for a reason.  And everybody knows this is the guy in the neighborhood that's a little creepy around  the kids, but there's no physical evidence.  Legally, he gets off, but we all know.  But that's a technicality thing.  But it's not a self-defense.  This is a law that is there to protect somebody that is saving their own lives.  But that's also the law. 
[00:51:00]  That's also the law.  I'm only saying just because you can't prove it legally doesn't mean we don't know who  this guy is.  The molestation part of it.  No, I can't even, I can't even go along with that analogy, Jimmy.  I can't because the molestation as opposed to the self-defense.  Let's give Jenny Hutt a chance here.  Oh, Christ.  She's a big TV star now.  Hi, Jenny.  Jenny.  Jenny.  I'm actually on my way in to do my radio show.  Oh, look at you.  You're so busy.  I was watching you last night with all those people and the frigging, the woman with the 
[00:51:30]  big angry African hat on.  And you are still brainwashed by the people around you.  Don't you see?  Trayvon was not afraid.  And I agree with Jim.  The whole, I don't think that George Zimmerman was like, hey, let me murder a kid tonight.  I think something weird happened and he didn't do the right thing and he should be punished.  I don't think he should be guilty of murder, too.  I'm sure he's not going to be.  He shouldn't be punished for being a douche. 
[00:52:00]  I wish he could be punished for being a douche.  But the facts are the facts and, you know, Zimmerman was pretty much allowed to do what  he did that night, unfortunately.  I want to see him go for something.  I want to see him, from what I know so far about him, I want to see him get some kind  of manslaughter.  All right, littering.  One of the rounds.  Popping on the lawn.  They haven't proven their case against Mr. Zimmerman.  Yes, Jenny.  But Anthony, what makes me dunce-like? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, please don't answer that.  Now you can.  What makes you dunce-like is that you're just feeding off of the people at that goddamn channel.  And you're not looking at just these facts.  What the fuck makes you think Trayvon was so scared and running, and George Zimmerman  pursued him and shot him?  None of that is even close to what the evidence shows.  Look, this is why I said last night that I'd be a bad juror on this kind of case. 
[00:53:00]  Because as a mother, as a mother, I tend to have compassion.  Oh, Christ.  She's done.  I get that.  That doesn't make me a duck.  That makes me a mob.  Oh.  Put that aside.  I'll kick you off the jury.  I'm not going to be on this jury, thankfully.  Good thing.  And those jurors that were on there last night on the after show, where they have the after  dark thing, and they have six complete retards sitting there, and they're like, do you think 
[00:53:30]  George Zimmerman was the one on the tape screaming?  And then they have these news people come in and brainwash these people, and then they  all say, no, it wasn't George.  Like, what?  What?  All of them?  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  I do want to say that you three are having such a compelling, interesting, smart conversation  about the case.  And listening to the three points of view is really good. 
[00:54:00]  Jenny Hutt.  Thank you, Jenny.  More importantly, are you giving the makeup bars a little extra money every night, or what?  You look hot as hell on that show.  You look good.  Your hair looks great.  I can't believe it's the same person that we see walking around here.  You do look good on that show, Jenny.  You look very lovely.  Maybe just don't talk so much.  Okay, goodbye.  Bye, Jenny.  Thank you.  All right, hot stuff.  Fucking wild redhead. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, shit.  All right.  We're going to talk about Michael Jackson's ass next.  Nice.  And my injury.  You got an injury.  Why wouldn't I just want to start getting in shape?  No.  Why wouldn't Faggot hurt himself?  Jimmy.  Why wouldn't?  Why wouldn't Faggot injure himself?  Why wouldn't he?  It happens, though.  Of course it does.  Of course it does.  Because Faggot finally starts losing his stomach, so fucking Pussy Boy Faggot hurts his little  left wrist.  I should be fucking shot in the fucking head. 
[00:55:00]  Your left wrist?  Who hurts their wrist?  Exactly.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm going to get fat again.  Fucking worthless cocksucker.  No.  Jimmy.  Utterly worthless.  All right.  We should take a break.  I want to come back down here.  I want to hear his wrist story.  Poor Joe.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Mysterious Dex.  This is the Irish Employer's show. 
[00:55:30]  The Irishателей.  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:30]  I was thinking of getting, like, behind blue eyes because that song talks to me.  So I would have maybe the Who logo on my left arm.  Oh, wow.  Imagine what you'd be thinking now, like, behind douche chills.  I don't know.  Jimmy might have been close to an Aussie tattoo over the years.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I'm wearing one of my knuckles.  On your knuckles.  Oh, my God.  Like Aussie has it. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  But I was young, though.  I mean, that's...  That would have been bad.  Can I tell them how good they were, please, as they walked by?  Seriously, open the door.  Better throw the door open.  Here they come, the mashup.  I want to say something.  What do you want to say?  See, you always expect the worst.  Look how tan you are.  You always expect the worst.  Damn, you're tan.  I did a lot of driving yesterday.  I did 270 miles of driving.  Yeah?  And guess what radio show I listened to for most of that time?  The morning mashup?  And I really liked it.  Yay! 
[00:57:30]  And that's it.  Thank you, man.  We appreciate that.  What do you want to say?  You know, tomorrow we'll go back to trashing you and all that.  No, I want to leave.  I like to...  I like to...  On a positive note.  I like Stanley and his raking picture.  How funny was that?  And that guy, I always forget his name, but...  He said he...  Ryan Sampson, ladies and gentlemen.  Ryan felt like he actually lost weight over the 4th of July weekend because he was playing  baseball and wiffle ball, s'mores, so you were thinking maybe I need to find some sticks  and you didn't want the kids to be burned on the metal ones and then what's his name 
[00:58:00]  over there said you should have used your talons and you were in Maine, you were in Milwaukee,  you were in Boston and Stanley was raking his yard in Philly.  Wow.  I heard...  Actually, I was at the airport listening to you guys on the on-demand app.  I was listening to the worst stuff.  Oh, isn't this just a fucking love fest?  Jimmy, Jimmy, let me jerk you off while I tell the story.  The story about your kid on the elevator.  Oh, right.  I feel like what a nightmare story. 
[00:58:30]  It was such a good story.  Oh, God, the poor kid.  And that was as real as it was, man.  I didn't have to pump that one up.  I really liked it.  For real.  Thank you, man.  These guys fucking are polished.  That's crazy.  And they all take turns being the lead guy.  Yeah, that's a lot of love there because, you know, I have mad respect for you guys.  And ever since Andy let me use his mic, I'm happy about that.  Wait, what's the song?  There's a song about Versace and not shopping.  I like the Target.  Everything is top shelf and sitting in the front row. 
[00:59:00]  What?  Macklemore.  Thrift Shop.  Thrift Shop?  Yeah.  It might have been Thrift Shop.  Are you just on that?  But then Sam said that every song is like that.  They're all the same, right?  All right.  Good job, though.  Love you, guys.  We'll trash you tomorrow because I can't help myself.  Is that a gay beach you're staying at out there?  Why?  What happened?  I'm just wondering.  The morning mashup?  Yeah, you listen to the mashup.  They were good.  I don't know.  I do appreciate good radio when you stumble upon it every once in a while. 
[00:59:30]  Stumbling upon it.  I don't think I can listen to it every day.  No.  To be honest with you.  But they did a really good job.  Don't let Ant bully you out of your enjoyment of the mashup.  I don't like Ant bullying Opie out of his enjoyment of the mashup.  Yeah, it doesn't like happiness.  What are you, queer?  No.  I listen too much, dude.  Yeah.  You know, I actually only listen for a couple minutes.  Oh, we got some of the banter from yesterday that I just described?  Oh, I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  It's from yesterday's show.  Okay.  Now this is where it gets bad for them.  Now it gets bad for the old stuff. 
[01:00:00]  See, we should have just left it alone.  No, it's going to get bad for them.  For them.  Yeah, yeah.  Should have just left it alone.  I know how this works.  It's so nice.  I've been doing this for way too long.  This is going to turn ugly quickly.  It was so nice.  What banter you got?  It's just, I don't know, top of the hour or whatever.  All right, let me hear if I heard this break.  All right, let's rake it up.  Because summer sounds best on the mashup.  It's serious.  XM hits one.  So Avril went and got married.  I mean, did you see?  Yes, she did.  She went and got married.  Her and Chad Kroger.  I think it was on Canada Day.  What day is that?  Sorry.  So I'm not even going to put it on our show. 
[01:00:30]  Avril's married?  Avril got married.  To the guy from Nickelback.  Oh my God, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong with her?  Rock and roll power couple there, huh?  Not really.  I don't know.  Oh, then there's a dumb song about, uh, uh, that, uh, I'll be your Jay-Z and you be my  Beyonce.  Ew.  That's fucking horrid.  Wow, that's bad.  That one's a big hit these days.  You know that one, Sam?  I'm sure I do.  Maybe not from that lyric. 
[01:01:00]  I'd rather you be my Joel and I'll be your Hedda.  Oh, I don't, I didn't like that.  I'll be your Scott, you be my Lacey.  I'll be your Scott, you be my Liberace.  That was like a terrible song. 
[01:01:30]  Horrid.  But why would you want to be Jay-Z and Beyonce?  Why don't you just be your own fucking person?  Well, they rich.  And this song is huge, I guess.  Because they played it five times at a half hour.  What's the hell?  Eric.  I'll be your Beyonce and you be my Jay-Z or whatever.  Something like that.  Eric, who sings it by Jay-Z?  I'm looking for it.  Find it.  All right.  I'm not really good at describing the hits, am I?  Anyone?  No, you're not.  I'm not really good.  Well, that should be a lyric.  If you be my Beyonce, just write those lyrics and it'll pop up.  People know this song?  Come on.  Help me out here.  These little songs. 
[01:02:00]  Nope.  Nothing on the...  Well, it's on our audience, though.  That's true.  What?  It's called Boomerang?  Yes.  It might be Boomerang.  Really?  Well, we'll know in a second.  Look at that.  If I was Jay-Z, you're my Beyonce, we can rock the nation like they do.  And if I was Da Vinci, you'd be Mona Lisa, bring a smile perfectly on you.  You're enjoying it?  It was sketchy. 
[01:02:30]  No, it was bothersome, to be honest with you.  Have you heard of the new Miley Cyrus?  This is terrible.  I don't mind this.  For what it is.  It's like pop, beach music.  Well, it's catchy.  But the lyrics are like, why would you want to be Jay-Z?  And that auto-tune shit's got to fucking go.  Yeah, it's annoying.  It's annoying.  What do you mean is be yourself.  Be the next Jay-Z instead of being Jay-Z.  Yeah, but it's not an easy song lyric to just throw.  What?  Be the next Jay-Z. 
[01:03:00]  You could be the next Beyonce.  It's a horrible song lyric.  Why?  It's terrible.  Be your own person.  The title will be Be Your Own Person.  If I was Jay-Z.  They rock the nation.  Do they rock the nation?  They get way too much credit.  It's not a big song.  What are you talking about?  They're a power couple, and within a couple of years, Jay-Z will be cheating all over the  fucking place.  And then they'll have to hide this song.  That's terrible. 
[01:03:30]  All right, uh, what other song do you tell us?  Oh, Thrift Shop.  What's that?  You got Thrift Shop?  Thrift Shop's been around forever.  Yeah.  I've never heard it.  That was kind of catchy.  Yeah.  Wait.  You know this one.  No, this isn't the one either, I don't think.  This song's like...  But it's another song about Gucci bags and shit.  No.  Yeah.  This isn't the one.  I never heard this shit.  The one I'm talking about kind of had an 80s feel to it. 
[01:04:00]  I never heard this joint.  An 80s feel.  You never heard this song?  Never.  This has been like a huge song for like six months.  I thought.  Really huge, huh?  Does the chick start singing?  No.  The one I'm talking about is some chick, and it has kind of like an 80s weirdness to it.  Why don't you listen?  Oh, forget it.  Who cares in the end?  Right?  I want to hear it.  But who cares in the end?  I like a good pop song.  Been trying to figure out the song for two days, and then when we finally play it, no one...  Oh, all right, great.  Can we move on to something else now?  I've been enjoying Gentleman.  I would have to agree with everyone.  By Psy.  I have that on my iPod, and I've been enjoying it. 
[01:04:30]  His follow-up hit?  It's great.  Oh, but gentle style.  It's the same fucking song.  It's not a hit.  It's not a hit.  It's not a big song.  No, no, no.  It's fucking half a billion hits on YouTube.  It's just a big YouTube video.  It's not a big song.  Opa, Opa, Opa, Opa, Opa, Opa, Opa, Opa, Opa.  This is a good one.  I do like this.  It didn't catch up.  Not as much as the other one.  You really like this one, Jimmy?  I really am.  And how does he do this?  It's a catchy one. 
[01:05:00]  I know, I believe you.  How does he do this?  I want Koreans in lime green pants to rub on my ass while this song is playing.  Like, young, thin Korean boys.  Definitely sounds like poppers music.  The English sucks.  Is he singing in English and Korean or is it all in good?  I have no idea.  I think it's Korean.  I'll tell you, you know, it's bad.  We don't know what language it is.  I really don't know.  I'm going to get some English. 
[01:05:30]  You don't like this, Tim?  No, I mean, it's the same song.  Oh, it might be Boogie by Jesse Malay.  Jesse Malay.  Yeah, look up Jesse Malay.  Toph McGoff on Twitter.  My God.  Might have it.  How do you spell Malay?  Let's see.  M-A-L-A-Y.  Let me see if it says this.  Then we can hold on.  Role play?  No, he's saying it's Boogie. 
[01:06:00]  B-O-U-G-I-E.  Okay.  Boogie.  B-O-U-G-I-E.  From Co-  Yeah.  Nice.  This is it.  B-O-U-G-I-E.  I always say B-O-U-G-I.  From Co-  That's like Randy Gaga.  B-O-U-G-I-E.  I always say B-O-U-G-I.  B-O-U-G-I.  B-O-U-G-I.  I always say B-O-U-G-I.  B-O-U-G-I.  I'm popping tags.  This is horrible.  It's not called Boogie.  It's B-O-U-G-I.  B-O-U-G-I.  B-O-U-G-I-E.  B-O-U-G-I-E.  There's a fuck. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, it's just not good.  Yeah, it's just some hoa.  Yeah, bragging about how she sits in the front row.  At least we got the song finally.  Yeah, I don't care for this.  Well, it was also 4.15 in the morning.  yeah i can't get behind this one she's rhyming louis with bougie a bunch of times yeah 
[01:07:00]  but she sounds really sexy yes don't ruin it like that adele is the word bougie taken off  and bougie's been around for like for years it's a black word really is it as hot as cheddar  black people who like act like rich and fancy are considered bougie is uh yeah is kenny bougie  that's why we just throw all this shit out there because then it leads to something

[01:22:00]  from the fire a little bit  where was this  uh they didn't say  well they don't show it  in writing  castleberry  florida  poor guy  that's fucking awful  kind of castleberries  back there  stubborn  oh that would be good  castleberries  it's a white castle  mosquito bite  oof  they're the worst  what  let's see  what happened  what happened  what happened 
[01:22:30]  it was very funny  that the aunt said  castleberries  castleberries  twice  and no one acknowledged it  and he just looked at his hand  and went  I got a mosquito bite  I've been itching my hand  can we hear that again  because castleberries  bombed horribly twice  Jesus  and then he just looks down  at his mosquito bite  it's a mosquito bite  tough room  it is  it's a tough room  what are you looking for it 
[01:23:00]  uh oh  you got it  no hang on a second  yeah he's fine  oh  look at him  very decisive  no no no  I got it  I know it though  I'm paying attention  that was Sam's attempt  to throw him under the bus  you got it buddy  oh yeah yeah  absolutely  yeah no I know  but you didn't really care  that's how you  called him buddy  you hoped he didn't  you hoped he was gonna go  oh wait I wasn't listening  my favorite thing ever  I wasn't listening  what do you need  makes me laugh every time  and he gets so mad about it  well Sal was on the phone  I don't know what happened 
[01:23:30]  after that  I can hear you when I have it  okay let's hear it  let's hear  poor guy  that's fucking awful  kind of castleberries back there  I'm starving  that would be good  castleberries  it's a white castle  mosquito bite  I am  I am just like babbling  over here  castleberries  choo choo  god damn it  that made me laugh 
[01:24:00]  I'm Northwest  you say North  you don't walk around  calling me  hi Chris Jenner  you know  hi Chris  here it is Chris  so you're about to  since you're on talk show  you have all these spin offs  you have your whole life  on television  this is going to be a complete disaster  did you predict this type  of success  I hate her  I fucking hate that whole fucking family  right  she's sexy though man  why does anyone still watch it  they watch it like  I don't get it  she and Sharon Osbourne  went back and forth a bit 
[01:24:30]  why  you know  Sharon said something about  her talk show is going to fail  and that  she prostitutes her children  for fame  but she does  and then  but the kids are alright with it so  Chris Jenner said that  Sharon's been leeching off Ozzy  for years so  she's wanted to talk  Chris Jenner's an asshole  that's what I heard  Sharon Osbourne has made her  her own life  yeah  she's Ozzy's manager  and she actually was  the brains behind the whole  fucking Ozzy thing  for many many years  I know that even  and I'm not a huge  Sabbath fan like Jimmy 
[01:25:00]  you're saying you don't  credit her for being  the brains behind  the Kardashian operation  well she is  she is though actually  she is  I'm not saying she's not  but to say that  Sharon Osbourne  has been just feeding off Ozzy  that's stupid  everyone knows  that Sharon  you know  was the brains  behind all that shit  Ozfest and everything  yeah  she's pulling plugs  on bands  and she probably  made the deal  for the Osbournes  reality show  that wasn't Ozzy  yeah I don't see Ozzy  sitting down negotiating  no  yeah  it was a massive show 
[01:25:30]  that led to the Kardashians  being able to do  their reality show  we went to our rights  in perpetuity  I think that's more  Sharon's  I'm sure her show  will be terrific  her talk show  what is she going to do  on her talk show  it'll be  a complete disaster  what network is it on  I don't even know  probably Fox  if she's on Fox News  right  well she's doing  all the news channels  yeah she's not going to have it  on Fox  she's on like one of those  weird little channels 
[01:26:00]  I bet  anyone else see the commercial  for Arsenio Hall  coming back  to late night  is he still not back yet  what the fuck's he waiting for  I know  the big fucking thing  I think in the fall  about this a year  yeah  yeah he's  he's coming back  how do you think  that'll do  he might do  he might do alright  but there's no  I don't understand  why he ever went away  that's what's so confusing  to me  he was so  he was huge  when did he go  what happened  he had the biggest  drop off  does anyone know why  I'll tell you  what the theory is  yeah  that Hollywood  when he had Farrakhan 
[01:26:30]  on and allowed him  a free platform  Hollywood  mostly are Jewish  and I heard a lot of them  were so fucking  outraged  that he  that he gives this guy  a platform  now again  that was what I heard  I don't know  what his ratings were  so they blackballed him  because  I mean  he dropped off drastically  I don't know  and went away  I mean  no one saw the guy  for at least 10 years  there was some kind  of a lawsuit too  I think  where an alleged law  there was gonna be  where someone  who worked for him  I thought  sexually harassed  a male model  a guy 
[01:27:00]  I don't  again  this was all  so many years ago  right  I could just be  piecing two different  stupid stories  but he did Celebrity Apprentice  and now it's led  to his big comeback  he's gonna be  back on Late Night  I don't know  if he'll do as well  as he used to  because when he came  it was only Carson  and Letterman  so he was such a  different feel  the young black guy  and doing the fist pump  no one was doing that  but now  I don't know  if there's as much  of a call for it  it's gonna be  on Channel 11  I think  so the expectations  aren't huge 
[01:27:30]  and he's not a young guy  like it's not like  he's not Jimmy Kimmel  he's not Jimmy Fallon  he's like  he's the old regime  but he might bring in  the blacks  well  that's true  maybe  what about the blacks  maybe some late night TV  what's his  what's his thing  you wanna watch the promo  yeah  it looks like a promo  from a long time ago  he looks pretty good  he looks great  yeah  fuck  like don't crack  I don't wanna overstate  the importance  of my return  to late night television 
[01:28:00]  wow he looks great  but yes  the earth is shaking  hey  why are y'all stuck  he's still rolling  something big  is coming to late night  the Arsenio Hall show  he looks really good  and then he does  his patented move  where he  puts his head down  remember  he used to do that  before he came out  the curtain opened up  he was standing like that  and then he lift his head up  he kiss his fingers  he throw it out  and then start fist pumping  what's up my niggas  yeah yeah  exactly  something like that 
[01:28:30]  he said  yeah yeah  that's how he started  every show  what?  no  yeah  he didn't drop  n-bombs  no  he did  what years was he on  originally  89 to 94  that's it  he was only on  five years  a quick five years  and then he just  went away  and then he completely  disappeared  what happened at the end  do they say  can we look at  mid-wikipedia  his ratings could not have  he dropped that much  well you would think  after all that though  he would have  continued with something  in entertainment  he did nothing  he had Ali on  do you remember  when he interviewed Ali  it was a tough interview  because Ali was talking  then but not 
[01:29:00]  it was a really hard interview  because Ali was so soft  and then fucking  Mike Tyson comes out  in the middle of the interview  and sits next to them  I do remember that  that was fucking  before the internet  they all pointed  and laughed at Ali  it was unbelievable TV  there was Clinton  coming out  playing the saxophone  that was huge  and then Dice  Dice coming out  you didn't put yourself out there  Dice actually  started weeping  breaking down  he's saying that 
[01:29:30]  Arsenio's official statement  is that he just  one day realized  he was no longer in love  with what he was doing  so he walked away  from the show  that's bullshit  yeah something happened  we did any old  Arsenio clips  because he was  he was very original  he did the movies there  with Eddie Murphy  coming to America  that was 83 though  83  yeah coming to America  no maybe it's 86  really  that's the mid 80s  that was before his show  I believe so  was it 89  maybe I'm wrong  it was around that time 
[01:30:00]  88  so it was right before his show  okay  alright  before his show  well then he really did  just go away didn't he  and I don't know  I had heard  what year was Farrakhan on  I'm gonna guess  93  Farrakhan  yeah I mean  there's tons of clips  Farrakhan  Farrakhan  Farrakhan  Farrakhan  do you have Ali Tyson  Farrakhan  or something  or whatever  someone you guys want  I'm just throwing out  clips out there  or Farrakhan maybe  it was a really tough interview  it's like 1960 
[01:30:30]  wow Ali looked good  there though  yeah  how did he sound  back in 93  he's throwing some jabs  yeah Tyson and Sugar Ray Leonard  came out  what year was this  I'm guessing 90  91  so he was already  talking shitty in 90  91  oh yeah  he was just slow  look at fucking Mike  Iron Mike sitting there  yeah motherfucker  yeah 
[01:31:00]  oh shit  he's got Tyson  Sugar Ray Leonard  and Ali  yeah  that's a good picture  Ali looks good too  now  what's wrong  this one here  he's bigger  huh  I'm scared of him  you're scared of this one  he's a  he's a sweetheart  he's a real champ  he's a real champ  really  yeah he's  he's having trouble  right there  you're a real champ  who would have won 
[01:31:30]  if you fought  this man  in your prime  oh shit  he's pointing at Tyson  fucking say Don King  Ali  Ali  Ali  Ali  Ali  Ali  Ali went on a talk show  he can't talk  he's just kind of pointing  yeah you weren't dancing  you moved  I wasn't that powerful  I was so fast  uh-huh  and he hit me  and he fell back in his chair 
[01:32:00]  you go here Mike  shut the fuck up  I eat your children's  yeah  what would you say Mike  I  I  by no means  I'm vain  and I know I'm great  but can I tell you something  in this situation  every head must die  every tongue must confess  this is the greatest  yeah  oh Iron Mike  this is a real love fest  going on right here  but you can't be the asshole  that says  yeah I would win  I'd kick his ass 
[01:32:30]  actually  you can't be that guy  but is that  but what great TV  that was  like that type  that was like  old Tonight Show type shit  where these guys  come out unexpectedly  right  and it's a really  non-scripted moment  and like that was  just a kind of a fun  I liked watching him  you don't realize  how fucking old  the show was though  I was in Buffalo  I would watch  yeah I liked Arsenio Hall  that's a fucking old show  yep  I can't believe  he was only on  for five years  and then  he's got the  he's got the Clintons there  and that clip 
[01:33:00]  Hillary  both of them  oh man  who else is in there  where's Dice  where's Dice  when you put yourself  out of here  oh god  oh Arsenio Dice  I don't want to know  what you have  oh my  look at Dice  movie that we're  going to talk about  called The Adventures  of Sports Fairland  we're going to talk  about everything tonight  this  it's a foundry logo  on this video  look at it  it's nice  Star and Nora Dunn 
[01:33:30]  and Sinead  you want to talk  about that  charisma  I got it  young Dice  yeah that's  you know  people do  what they have to do  and you know  I mean  Nora Dunst  did what she had  to do  I'm sorry  how is that  last name pronounced  Dunst  D-U-N-C-E  but that  you know  it's all nonsense  you know  I'm a great comedian  and obviously  there are women  that enjoy 
[01:34:00]  this kind of humor  alright alright  don't get crazy  I didn't make  my decision yet  does it bother you  can you pause this  for a second  it needs to set up  so this was  SNL with  Nora Dunn right  yeah that fake bitch  I forgot what happened  he was hosting  and she had a problem  with him hosting  or something  she was hosting 
[01:34:30]  and she was hosting  Dice was hosting  Dice was the guest host  and Nora Dunn  was a cast member  at that point  hold on  somebody that knows  is coming in  thank you Kenny  someone that knows  I feel like this clip  needs a little bit  of a set up  for the people  Sinead O'Connor  was the musical guest  oh he was part  of that whole thing  she was the first one  and then Nora Dunst  jumped on the bandwagon  they said they wouldn't  be on with him  so Sinead didn't  do the show  no  neither  but Sinead was  the first one  and Dunn said  yeah I'm not doing  the show this week either 
[01:35:00]  she jumped on the bandwagon  right okay  helped her career  yeah  she's nowhere  how fucking hateable  is Nora Dunn  oh fuck her  you fucking fake bitch  and comedians  are supposed to have  more of an open mind  about shit  was she a comedian  or just a sketch con  I know nothing about her  well I mean  she lived in the  you know what  Andrew told me  huh  he saw Sinead O'Connor  backstage  combing her hair  and then she pulled  her pants up  what was she 
[01:35:30]  combing her  coat of hair  or something  don't make no sense  it's just  the enjoyment  that comes on his face  he really is  just a happy guy  when he's telling  those little stories  when he's reminiscing  yeah  I believe  that was the first time  they used the delay  I'm pretty sure  oh wow  yeah  went to the MTV Awards  yeah  so Dice  got a lot of shit  for that  Dice is a  red bull  they took Nora Dunn's  side for the most part 
[01:36:00]  yeah that was in  May of 1990  Colin raised a good  point about how  and this was  Colin said something  about how all the  women's groups  came after him  but they really  what they wanted to  was go after rap  they just didn't have  the fucking courage  to do that  so they went after  him instead  good luck  and they were right  and Colin was right  that that is what  they did  they targeted Dice  knowing he was a  comic  but Dice  Dice I really think  was the start  of like the big push  of political correctness  started with Dice  because it annoyed 
[01:36:30]  people so much  that he was doing  so well  and being so famous  but I can't think  of real political  correctness catching  on before him  if people want to  read a story about him  he's featured in  the July issue  of Playboy  oh  somebody else  might be mentioned  also  maybe club soda  Kenny  pseudonym  I saw  what did the  name do to you  good one Chip  thanks a lot  KS  I saw Dice this 
[01:37:00]  weekend when I was  in Vegas  I went and saw him  on Friday night  I forgot  yeah we were off  I mean it was the  night before UFC  so I went and saw  Andrew and  yeah club soda  yeah words back  it's C  what  C what  what's the K  stand for  C way out of  this conversation  yeah exactly  it's an A and B  conversation  so see yourself  into a fucking  hole you  cocksucker  piece of garbage  eat your peanut  butter and jelly  like a third  yeah how old  are you 37  or something 
[01:37:30]  that doesn't make  sense  he's just a third  grader you a  little idiot  so I went to  see Andrew and he  performed he was  very funny  and then afterwards  his son's band  LA Rocks played  at the hard rock  and they were  fucking good man  oh yeah  they were really  good yeah and  they have a bassist  now so it was  like a three of  them and it was  all like family  and friends  oh cool  and then people  were kind of  filtering in from  outside and coming  in and watching  and digging it  and it was really  cool to watch  they're definitely  going to do  something  oh wow 
[01:38:00]  and he was so  proud  of course  but it was  really nice  I was glad  I was there for  but he looks  good  Dice looks  good man  he lost weight  yeah he looks  great  he's going to  be in the new  Woody Allen movie  I heard  Louis CK's in it  also  yeah  a lot of big  stars  yeah  so this is  this is 1990  oh yeah  so there's the  set up  so it was  it was the  Norah Dunn  controversy  yeah yeah  is this when  he cried  that's the one  yeah  oh is it  okay  oh you don't  like this  you thought  it was bad  right  sad  oh  it's sad 
[01:38:30]  or it hurt him  oh no  that's  that's for real  those aren't  oh no no  I know  it's a real moment  but he didn't  plan on that  right  oh no way  he's got caught  you know  this is like  months of  you know  this is right  after his big  arena tour  right  all right  he just lost  his movie career  right  right right  blackballed after  Ford Fairlane  because of all  the pressure  from the gays  you know  the misogynistic  people  oh boy  and Dice's  thing  like  this was 
[01:39:00]  like  I think  was this  the first  I'd say  crack in the  armor  but there  was like  was this  the first  time people  saw him  kind of  just being  chink in  the armor  yeah  actually  I should  say chink  in the  armor  yeah  was this  the first  time  anybody  saw  like  the real  guy  yeah  the first  and only  time  oh man  that was it  huh  because I  think that  he probably  as like  it would have  been better  for him  if he had  kind of  let people  see a little  more of that  first  and not  necessarily  through something  this  extreme 
[01:39:30]  and this  much  of a  departure  yeah  I think  he should  have never  you know  well you know  you can't  help it  yeah  but I think  you know  the Dice  character  that he  portrays  doesn't do  that  but if he  had just  let's say  he had talked  a bit more  and let people  see how silly  he is  and all that  stuff  oh right  okay  that's what  I'm talking  about  yeah okay  I got you  the real  Dice  yeah  if you talk  to him  now  he'll talk  a little  bit more  real  he's a  regular guy  he just  knows how  to curse  good  yeah  let's see 
[01:40:00]  how this  went down  that day  it's been  a while  on your  poster  that it's  been defaced  as long as  they don't  touch the  face  you know  people  you know  some people  like my jokes  some don't  I mean  that's all  dependent  upon one's  personal taste  okay  I was at  when you say  the word  taste  people go  crazy 
[01:40:30]  look at the way  I dress  I can tell  I was at  a press conference  this morning  for the  MTV Awards  I was there  with Aerosmith  and MC Hammer  and there  were a lot  of issues  to be discussed  but the first  thing the press  asked me  was  will Andrew  Dice Clay  be at the  MTV Awards  well it depends  what they pay  sure if they want  me there  I'll be there  you know  I mean I'm  pretty busy 
[01:41:00]  now  you know  that  but you'd  like to come  yeah sure  why not  you wanted  to perform  in one of  Donald Trump's  venues  and there  were some  problems  no no problem  I don't know  what you heard  but Donald  you know  we're very close  friends  me and Donald  well I meet  those kind of  people now  and what happened  he wanted me  to come to his  birthday party  and I couldn't  be there  so I just  sent the videotape  you know  and it was  the hit of the  party  you know  that's the truth  I heard something  you know 
[01:41:30]  else backstage  but that's the truth  what I was told  was that  he didn't want  you performing  in any of his  places  let me tell you  something about  Donald  didn't they  he fixed my  sister's roof  a few weeks ago  because it was  leaking  no bull  he's a great guy  you know  no matter what  they say  I mean  I see him  on the cover  they rip him  apart  Donald Trump  is here to stay  he's a great guy  and whenever  somebody's on top  they look to  knock him down  that's the way  it is  just smoking 
[01:42:00]  yeah  I've seen your act  many times  and often  I even watch  and I get a little  uncomfortable  I saw you do a joke  one night  that I thought  was a racist joke  and I'm wondering  do you ever  have second thoughts  about racist humor  for instance  I mean  for instance  if you were in a club  and some guy  did an anti-semitic joke  it's been done 
[01:42:30]  and how did you feel  when it was done  it's a joke  let me tell you something  the kind of stuff I do  the reason I could pick on  people from other countries  that kind of stuff  is because  years ago  you know  you had like  the Polish joke  you know  where you had two Jews  walk into a bar  that kind of stuff  but over the last  let's say 10 years  there's been such an  influx of people  from other countries  and the reason that is  is because this country  is the greatest country  in the world  and we let everybody  come here  and we give everybody  opportunity 
[01:43:00]  we give everybody  opportunity  and because of that  that gives me  more comedic material  I mean  I look at it this way  you go into Manhattan  someplace like Manhattan  every  every  every  every fruit stand  is owned  let's say  by a Korean  that's the way it is  every kid  is driven by  some guy  wearing a turban  or a jewel  in the middle  of his head  now I find that funny 
[01:43:30]  so I have what  to make part of  you know  and you gotta be  able to laugh  I mean  I don't talk about  anything that  doesn't exist  you know  I mean  when I talk  whether it's about  a couple in the  front row  who I think  have a lousy  sex life  or the relationship  that stinks  or that kind of thing  it exists  when I talk about  girls having  one night stands  it exists  when I talk about  gays  blacks having  penises the size  of oak trees  that exist  you know  I mean 
[01:44:00]  I'm not  when you do  when you do  something like that  I get personally  offended  because I didn't  get one of them  damn oak trees  that look  Rosario has  it's that  flat top  face  with the big  round glasses  I'm a jewish guy  so imagine me  alright  but  I mean  that's what this world  we're made up  of a lot of  different people  and I'm a comedian  and the difference 
[01:44:30]  between me  and every other comic  is when I'm on stage  there is no editing  you know  what I see that day  or when I go  into a grocery store  and I have one item  and the guy in front  of me has a basket  and you're going  hey can I just  go in front  hey I've been online  for 20 minutes  I've been online  for 20 minutes  so I feel like  urinating on the guy  you know  so I just bring it  to the attention  I don't like this stuff  everybody else does  I just deliver it  ok  now I'm going to ask you  about another situation 
[01:45:00]  if you want  to  get away from it  just give me  one of these  one of them  this is still relevant  what's going on  yeah  one of your biggest  biggest critics  has been  comedian Sam Kinison  recently  he came up to you  and offered his hand  in friendship  I heard about it  I wasn't there  what's the deal  with that  there is no deal  he offered his hand  in friendship  and I shook his hand  you know  I don't look to 
[01:45:30]  you know  I have been ripped apart  by just about  every comic  there is  and it goes back  to the Trump thing  when you're on top  people look to  knock you down  because when people  come up against  somebody on top  their name is heard  you know what I mean  and that's what's  going on with a lot  of comics  you know  Sam's had his problems  he's trying to  smooth them out  beautiful you know  yeah  can we expect  a tour maybe  with Sam  opening for you  around the country  oh maybe they could  do that now  oh that's right  I work alone 
[01:46:00]  that's the way I am  and uh  actually I'm  I'm not even  going to really  do any more arenas  you know  because I did something  I mean people go  you know  what's the real  Andrew Clay Silverstein  who is that  other you know  opposed to Dice  you know  because I get  you know  who's Dice  who's Andrew Clay  who's the Jewish kid  who's the guy  that's acting  Italian  you know  well  you want to know  who he is  I'll tell you  Andrew Clay 
[01:46:30]  no let me get  this straight  and everybody  watching  and everybody  in the studio  should hear it  Timmy just farted  Andrew Clay  is the guy  that came out  here about  10 years ago  and broke his ass  you know  what I mean  broke his ass  he believed in himself  became the hottest comic 
[01:47:00]  in the world  and anybody  that doesn't like it  could wipe their ass  with whatever they say  about me  what happened  and that's the end  why did it end  what happened  to the crying  what happened  that's the whole reason  why we played that  what happened  you put yourself out there  yeah that's the famous line  you put yourself out there  probably edited by whoever's website  that was  oh hell  there was some nasty shit  about him scrolling across  who did that  that wasn't Steve  no it would have been 
[01:47:30]  whoever uploaded it  oh okay  but the feud too  with him and Sam  that feud was always  in Sam's head  yeah  because they came up  together  they were friends  they used to go to  the grocery store  at night  and steal steaks  just so they could  eat dinner  statue of limitations  on that  yeah  and then  Sam hit it first  before Andrew  yeah  and then when Andrew  hit  Sam said  there's not enough  room in this business  for both of us  oh man  used to work for Sam  a little bit too  right Kenny  yeah 
[01:48:00]  back in the day  that was  a little bit  it was hard  yeah  why  well because Sam  used to like to partake  and I was on the job  so  ah  a little conflict  of interest right there  right  you'd be doing coke  all night  and have to go to work  tonight  you couldn't do  your job properly  yeah  I'd get some  in my mustache  oh wow  that must have been tough  alright  and then  I was with Sam  the night  Andrew was on MTV  Music Awards  yeah 
[01:48:30]  and he did  Jack Spratt  you know  and then  you know  when Dick Clark  was given an apology  two seconds later  oh gosh  and you know  Sam was in the  dressing room  going oh  that's it  he's finished  he's done  he's over  and that's what  put him in arenas  wow  just that one  fucking show  damn  what was Dick  what was Dick Clark's  apology  I never saw that  he was the producer  of the  oh no I know  but I mean  I actually never watched  Dick Clark Apologize  I'd love to see that  I remember  Dice doing this  everyone  it's all everyone  talked about 
[01:49:00]  when  you know  the next day  after MTV  if something happened  everyone spoke about it  wow  I don't know  how to explain that  so people get it  yeah we get it  sure  just waiting for Sam  to find out  he can't find it  no it's not up  no  isn't it weird  when you're like  what the fuck  why isn't that up there  yeah that should be up there  everything should be available  on the computer  for everything  take one fucking  kitten video off YouTube  and put that in its place  put that there  Jesus  alright look  the kitten videos are adorable  they are  you're right actually  yeah he's just kidding  alright we're gonna take a break 
[01:49:30]  I think Brad Thor's coming in today right  yes  he was great  we had him on for the first time  it can't be a year ready  is it  it's a while  he has another book  why wouldn't it be a number one best seller  yeah Brad Thor  sells fucking books  yeah we liked him a lot  when he came in  and he's making his return today  so that's very cool  Brad Thor on Twitter  and  alright  we'll play something here I guess  this  this is the O.P. and Anthony  show 
[01:50:00]  O.P. and Anthony  for Sirius XM  the O.P. and Anthony  continues  Jack White day  on the O.P. and Anthony show  38 today huh  there's another guy  celebrating birthday today  that makes us feel very old 
[01:50:30]  do you want today's  makes me feel old birthday  let me see  Donald Rumsfeld  81  no  kind of feel that right  no  Donald Rumsfeld  O.J. Simpson  66  I thought he was older  right  so that doesn't make you feel too old  right  Tom Hanks  Tom Hanks is  a lot of famous people  born on this side  I'll say Tom Hanks is  64  57 
[01:51:00]  ouch  he's only 57  he's starting to look a little older  than his age  I just thought he was around forever  Courtney Love  another famous birthday today  49  the one that wasn't highlighted  is the one that makes  a lot of us feel  pretty old today  and that would be  old Fred Savage  old Fred Savage  from the  you got the song  you got the song  he rocked  you don't have it  from the wonder years  how many times have we told you 
[01:51:30]  to have that song ready  at all times  right  how old do you think  old Fred Savage is  from the wonder years  close to 30  68 years old  close to 30  Jimmy says  oh he's over 30  37  oh  what happened  what happened  how is he  37  he was just a little kid  with his stupid  Jets jacket  he was the little kid  he's 37 years old  that's too old  what do you put that 
[01:52:00]  Savage up for  Ben Savage  cause he's the fucking shit  he married Topanga  and they're bringing back  Ben Savage  who's Ben Savage  I've never heard of him  it's his brother  started on  Boy Meets World  hello  I never saw that  he did very well  in his own right  and they're bringing him back  as a parent now  or something  well Girl Meets World  is like this new spit off  and it's about  the little child  of Corey and Topanga  so  what was the  one two years song  oh my god  oh  the one two years  are here 
[01:52:30]  oh yeah  I've heard this  okay  I like this  it's actually good  he had a great  it's Joe Cocker  yeah  this was a big show  right  picture of the little  yeah  this was a big show  how many years  was it on  I think  seven or eight  is that one of those  shows that  premiered like right  after the Super Bowl  or something  I think it's one of those  like  probably  yeah  they're like  after the Super Bowl  check out the new  show  the later years  what year  I want to guess 
[01:53:00]  87  and I think the guy  who wrote the show  was from our  neighborhood  and I think it's  based on like  the Harborfields  school district  what year  I think it was  88  88  I think it was  based on Leahy  or something  to get real local  guys  the writer was  a Long Island dude  I did not know that  that's why Fred Savage  with the Jets jacket  but not only Long Island  but pretty much  our stomping ground  they still love this show  but I only watched it  in reruns 
[01:53:30]  so like Happy Days  why only in reruns  what's wrong with you  it was 88  it was 5  when it came out  your little nickel flicker  a quarter  there's a nickel  we started  this little flick  couldn't hold the quarter  I'd have to kiss it strong  kiss it strong  suck your tootsies  but I always assumed  that  this and the Happy Days  were like  old shows  even though they were  portraying old times  the time they were 
[01:54:00]  portraying was accurate  to when the show  actually came out  like I didn't think  Happy Days of the Wonder Years  were period pieces  oh  oh really  I thought this show  came out right after Vietnam  oh  see  that's kind of  ridiculous  yeah  yeah I gotcha  yeah  and of course  Marilyn Manson  ended up becoming  a huge rock star  after fucking  the Wonder Years  I don't want to  burst any bubbles  what  what are you talking about  they got a picture  right there  what are you talking about  I hate to be the guy 
[01:54:30]  that spoils this  for everybody  what  what  that's not him  look  it looks just like him  the actor that played  Paul Pfeiffer  oh Paul Pfeiffer  was Marilyn Manson  everyone knows that  was not  Marilyn Manson  see you didn't  no because  you didn't know  it was Marilyn Manson  yet  that was Marilyn Manson  playing Paul Pfeiffer  oh  and then you know  after the show  goes off the  off the air  he decided to  you know  give the music thing  a try  he had a close call  with the pop rocks  and some coke  that's right 
[01:55:00]  yeah  yes  that's what I heard  wow  37  Jesus  37  fuck  do you know  what  88  let's see  that means  the hot sister  has got to be  like 50 then  right  because she was  a lot older  oh yeah  she does  chiller theater  now  how does she look  no  no  no  she looks  a little  waxy  who did  what do you mean  waxy  what's her name  Debo  Olivia Debo  Olivia Debo 
[01:55:30]  she was  pretty sexy  she was good  in the Conan movie  she looked all  hot in that shit  but I'll tell ya  nah  not so much  well  Iraq saw her  recently  she looks waxy  what does that mean  like she had  some  like a little  nip and tuck  dumb  but it looks  kind of waxy  when she's  sweating  and everything  she's right  you know what  that's not bad  she's waxy  but that's not bad  she's alright still  as opposed to good  she was  ridiculous hot  she was stunned  and then you go  not bad  sorry  well you know 
[01:56:00]  yeah you know  she had a relative  that was in all those  Skinamax movies  that was just naked  in every kind of  B horror thing  when Marilyn Manson  takes off the makeup  he looks like  a normal dude  yeah that's him now  that is right  Marilyn Manson  aka Josh Saviano  well his real name  is not Marilyn Manson  that's his  that's his stage name  it's Brian something right  his real name is  Josh Saviano  he was on  The Wonder Years  and there he is  without fucking makeup  why did they give 
[01:56:30]  a literal answer  literal Jimmy  I didn't mean to  and then the father  he's the one  that didn't age at all  that's so weird  and then of course  little Winnie Cooper  still a piece of ass  is she  oh yeah  with a mathematical  fucking brain  that's her now  yeah  wow how old is she  she's gotta be  33 or 35  she's gotta be  mid 30s as well  she married with kids  Jesus  I think she is  she's pretty  she is very pretty  what happened 
[01:57:00]  what was the big  first episode with her  a brother got killed  yeah  in the nom  was that the first one  and she blows  she blows Kevin  in the woods  oh wow  it's an amazing episode  and he's Asian  which is ironic  and she says  come on my face Charlie  it's a really weird show  who's the mom  from the show again  is she dead  no way  nah  so why wasn't she  in the group picture  that was just  just one of those  just the three of them  she said fuck this  who's the mom again  I forgot  I remember  what she looked like  I forgot what she looked like  I can't really tell 
[01:57:30]  that she did anything  oh right her  yeah sure  she still plays the mom  on stuff  yeah  the mom  okay  she probably was like 20  when she was playing the mom  in that  she just looks old  I'm at a point now  where I can start playing  the dad in shows  it's just scary  get in there  your darn runes  all filthy  clean it  that's good  yeah  get in there  clean it  your mother  your mother  made potatoes  and you're out there  running around  with the gang  get in there  and eat your potatoes  don't tell me

[02:09:30]  he was in  the public eye  that time  and they showed him  on camera  and it was like  oh my god  what's wrong  with Rock Hudson  oh my god  did he talk about it  I don't remember  no  he just  died from the AIDS  so he did a show  called Macmillan and Life  and years later  we just  remember the AIDS jokes  no  he died from a can  of bad meat  bad meat  in the can  bad meat in the can  yeah  can full of bad meat  yeah  yeah you never heard  that one  no  yeah  uh 
[02:10:00]  gonna bury him  bury him  uh  upside down  what was that one  where a gay guy  you'd bury him  his friends could  his friends could  do something  I don't know  I don't remember  I don't know  some kind of joke  but that was  Macmillan and Life  Macmillan and Life  was part of the  ABC mystery movie  which was  it was like a  rotating show  that they'd have  it was uh  ABC mystery movie  and then like  one week  it would be  Macmillan and Life  the next week  Columbo  the next week  McCloud  was this also  back in the 70s  yeah 
[02:10:30]  alright  you actually lost  me and Opie  on this one too  I was a little kid  you could have said  television didn't exist  in the 70s  and it wouldn't have  been just as  unbelievable  what about Seinfeld  oh yeah  I never got into Seinfeld  what  so wait  uh  McCloud  what was that one about  McCloud  McCloud  yeah  McCloud was uh  it was kind of a cowboy guy  uh lawman  you know  kind of a sheriff  or something  who came to the big city  to uh 
[02:11:00]  what you don't know  McCloud  to be a cop  this is off the air  completely  the cop in the big city  in 1977  alright  off the air  you can find the DVDs  I know what show  why would you  why would you  I know what show  you both probably liked a lot  Canon  Canon  that's always popular  with young women  Canon  no  Canon  not so much for Canon  a Quinn Martin production  how about uh  Quincy  it was this big fat detective  Quincy  there it is  Canon  I got a brother named after 
[02:11:30]  Quinn Martin  yeah  Quinn Martin was so famous  this one went off the air  in 76  yeah it's going uh  it's going back now  it's going back  how about  do you don't know Quincy  Quincy  no  Jack Klugman  before I worked for this show  do you know um  The Odd Couple with Jack Klugman  I've heard of The Odd Couple  I've never seen it  wow  Sydney  yeah  ever heard of it  I don't think so  you ever heard of The Odd Couple  I don't think so  pull it up  I don't think so  pull it up  I don't think so  oh boy 
[02:12:00]  oh not the movie  the TV show  you have to listen to the  can you guys hear in this  oh yeah  why wouldn't they know  The Odd Couple  that went off the air  in 1975  oh we're back  another year  I watch shows  that's true  that nobody reruns  The Odd Couple  yes they do  Mary Tyler Moore  Mary Tyler Moore show  I used to like  Mary Tyler Moore 
[02:12:30]  oh you did  yeah  okay that's about  the same ballpark  as The Odd Couple  I know this song  what channel is The Odd Couple on  do you know this song  the channel wasn't on  is it on  is it  you're saying it's rerun now  I don't know  but it was  Nick at Night  or Nickelodeon  or whatever  I haven't seen it recently  Nick at Night doesn't even do that  it's somewhere  Nick at Night does  Me TV  yeah Nick at Night does  Saved by the Bell  and Friends  yeah  it's all on TV land  TV land and Me  Me TV  plays it too  TV land  they probably have  on the one  they do  we can get everything  on DVD now too  so  you ever hear Mr. Ed 
[02:13:00]  I've heard of it  Mr. Ed is a talking horse  hold on  I got an idea though  we should give them  a little assignment  that they have to watch  one of these shows  and come back with a report  with a report  a book report  on a TV show  because they'll probably  have a weird  fucking take on it  right  what show though  that's great homework  what show  we gotta pick one  Keep Throat  something they can  obviously get  what show  could it be something  as ridiculous as McCloud  or do we go with  I really like the  movie mystery  McCloud 
[02:13:30]  or Columbo  McMillan and Wife  we all know that  McMillan and Wife  you can find just one episode  that they have to watch  oh yeah  do you get Netflix  should it be Quincy maybe  because we talk about Quincy  a lot on the show  Quincy they're gonna  I guarantee you  I challenge you to only  watch one episode  you're not gonna be able  to turn it off  let's give him a homework  assignment for tomorrow  you're gonna find him  sexy and intriguing  what show should it be  what show you think  sexy  Quincy isn't on Netflix 
[02:14:00]  oh come on  it's too popular  we're afraid of Crash Netflix  Crash Netflix  look at that  listen to the music  tell me this doesn't want  to get you young  young gals out there  on the dance floor  it's very Charlie's Angels  sounding music  yes it is  very Charlie's Angels  they don't know that show  either  probably the same guy  what's that  they don't know that show  he doesn't know Charlie's Angels  well you know  the movie  the movie  Drew Barrymore  this is supposed to be a movie 
[02:14:30]  starring Johnny Depp as Quincy  name three Charlie's Angels  blonde  brunette  but do you know names  no  actresses  not one  name the actresses  in the show or the movie  in general  in the show  in the show  one of them couldn't sit for a while  Farrah Fawcett  no  nothing  do you know  yeah I know who she is  I didn't know she was  I didn't know she was the original  so weird 
[02:15:00]  what show you want  Angels  McMillan and Wife  is on Netflix  oh wow  wow  alright  we gotta give him a show to watch  that's a little deep  you think so  yeah  I just think that Quincy  is so good  because he's such a smart dresser  and he's always  there's such action  Quincy's already involved  in such action  Quincy should be it right  you think it's Quincy  oh my god  who turns off Quincy  I challenge you  I challenge you 
[02:15:30]  to only watch one episode  girls  he looks like he doesn't want us  to watch it though  just by that cover picture  like he's so bored with himself  like he's bored with himself  right  Quincy  he's so busy solving crimes  what's a good episode  give us a synopsis  any episode  read the synopsis  I'll start from the beginning  how about the fucking  punk rock episode  that is a good one  okay this one  looks like it could be good  it's called  visitors in paradise  while enjoying a fishing trip  with Danny 
[02:16:00]  Quincy gets pulled  into a murder  and gets yelled at  for no reason whatsoever  Quincy gets pulled into a murder  investigation  involving a case  of mistaken identity  oh  that's good  the mistaken identity  fucking shit  who's Danny  is that his chick  or is that a guy  is it D-A-N-I  or D-A-N-N-Y 
[02:16:30]  I don't like that he's away  from one  detective Monaghan  hold on  those weird  read all the episodes  and the two sides of truth  how about a  hit and run  at Danny's  Jesus Christ  we don't know who Danny is  that's part of the book report  well I gotta start from the beginning  and watch it from the beginning  I can't jump in  it's gonna be like a recon  the hot dog murder  give us the synopsis  listen to this  a university student  enlists Quincy's help 
[02:17:00]  to determine whether  a man whose body  was recently donated  science  actually died  of natural causes  or hot dogs  or a hot dog  I don't like it  no  I need a murder  I need a murder  this one's good  sullied be thy name  oh  okay  a prostitute  oh  claims  a priest  oh  known for his  anti-pornography campaign  died of a heart attack  while having sex with her  that sounds fantastic  that's a lot of  yeah  that's good 
[02:17:30]  I like that  I like that  a little edgy  mark that one  a little edgy  the only thing worse  than a murder  is a cover up  oh wow  sounds just like him  by the way  you'll notice  when you watch it  you'll be like  oh my god  Jimmy sounded just like that  how many stars  does this have  it's full of them  Quincy  and then there was  Detective Monaghan  with special guest star  Lee Merriweather  full of stars  it's star stunning  and Sam  where do you get a load  of Sam  his Asian helper 
[02:18:00]  I think they were asking  how many stars  on Netflix  no they weren't  they were asking  about celebrity stars  it's three and a half stars  Dr. Aston  was it  four and a half  three and a half  out of what  70  three and a half  out of five  three and a half  out of four  three and a half  out of five  it's 70  Detective Monaghan  when do you see  Quincy get his  his ire up  when he gets his  hackles up  we could go for  one of the really  shitty late episodes  what special guest  Ann Archer 
[02:18:30]  just horrible  fucking guests  Ann Archer  Ann Archer  he might have been  he might have been  famous in 77 though  yeah  we don't know  sure  how about this episode  it's called  Dead and Alive  a woman tries  to convince Quincy  that her son  is still alive  even though  all of the  current evidence  suggests  that he was  murdered  starring Casey  Anthony  wow yeah 
[02:19:00]  that could be good  too  damn  well which one  do you ladies  want to watch  I'm just going to  start from the  beginning  with special guest  Richard Basehart  hold on  OCD Jackie  has to start  from the very  first one  I like that  do you  I do  I like that  what is the  first episode  you can't start  with the first  yeah you can  it's the pilot  they haven't really  they haven't really  gotten their  characters down  you gotta give it  a little time  halfway through  season two  yeah  maybe  I love the pilots  because it shows  what they wanted to do  but couldn't figure it 
[02:19:30]  out before they  actually  so all right  Jackie you can  watch two  you can watch  the pilot  and then watch  that one episode  we assign you  but if you like  a girl  you get two episodes  I think they should  watch a block show  they really do  yeah  what  yeah like  one of those  black sitcoms  good times  I don't know  because the language  is crazy  or All in the Family  something that  will shock them  because it's like  wow this was on TV  you've never seen  All in the Family  no  it was about 
[02:20:00]  a family in Queens  a white family  Archie Bunker  and his wife Edith  oh yeah  oh yeah  that lady just died  right  yes she did  she just died  that's the only reason  you know  yeah but  but they've seen  eclipses of it  it's  when you watch  I guess the shock  would be what they  could joke about  on TV  that's what I was  thinking  and the Family  guy makes  sound of it  like their  theme song  right  yes  yes at the  beginning  it's kind of  a similar  Archie Edith  thing  song  yeah  yeah  I don't know 
[02:20:30]  I don't know  I like the  just watch Quincy  yeah  only because you  want them to see  something cheesy  not something great  yeah that's true  All in the Family  is great  or good times  it was funny  but they'll be  shocked like  wow this was on  TV  that's true  but yeah  let's start with  Quincy  I think a bunch  of things for the  gals  if Quincy works  then we'll  continue the bit  with another show  yeah  alright Sam  we'll pick out  the episode  that you guys  watch  what was that  show with like  George Jackson  or something  George Jefferson  Jefferson  the Jefferson  that's a spin  off of All in the Family 
[02:21:00]  the Jacksons  yeah  my pal Sherman  yes that's true  well he's no longer  with me  no he's not  did they finally  bury him  they needed a hundred dollars  they couldn't find  a hundred dollars  for the guy  oh man that's brutal  that's really sad  did I ever play  the last message  he left me  oh my god  I might have that  oh let's hear it  I don't know  if I have it on my phone  he'd come around  every once in a while  no I don't have it  he used to hang out  in the lobby  of N.E.W.  downstairs  yeah  I don't know 
[02:21:30]  what that was about  I don't know  where he was going  what  yeah  oh yeah  we saw him  a lot  all right  we should break  they're going to watch  Quincy  and we're going to go  take a whiz  yeah I got a tinkle  you'll have a full report  tomorrow ladies  nice  definitely  and take notes  take it seriously  oh take notes  during the show  you'll love it  by the way  it's fantastic  can we pick an episode  I gotta guess  we'll pick it  the hot dog martyr  yeah we'll pick an episode  you gotta see the pilot  I want the prostitute  and the priest  that seems insane  all right  we'll do that one

[02:26:00]  in any order  you don't need to read them  you know  from the first one  so yeah  it has the same character  my guy is a Navy SEAL  that in an earlier book  got recruited to the White House  and to help bolster  the Secret Service's  counter-terrorism expertise  and they realized  this guy  is not happy  playing defense  he wants to be on offense  and so it's this thing  the president sets him loose  but then we had an election  I like to keep up  with the times in my books  and the new president said  you know what  people are gonna open their hand  they're gonna unclench their fist  don't need this guy anymore  so uh 
[02:26:30]  he actually got cut loose  and I have a private group  that's picked him up  uh  that kind of mirrors  a real private group  that the uh  defense department's been using  yeah  of course  I'm off their Christmas list again  does he go rogue?  yeah  look out  he goes rogue  he goes one man  yeah  in a world  in a world  in a world  oh so he's still  you know  he's working for a  kind of security firm  uh  that the government uses 
[02:27:00]  and uh  what does he kind of  do his own thing  he does  goes off  goes off the grid a little bit  and uh  takes care of business  he does  he does a little bit  in this one  I've got um  when 9-11 happened  my wife and I got stranded  on the east coast  and we were gonna go  uh  when I was in  when I was in college  uh  I  I attended bar  a couple of summers  on uh  an island in Greece  which was a freaking  awesome job  it sounds like the best job  you could ever have  it's called uh  Paros  P-A-R-O-S  it's in the  the center  of the  the 
[02:27:30]  the Kiklades Islands  in Greece  and I  they just  the tour boats  would come in  and nobody stayed  for longer than 48 hours  you know  I'd hear that horn  and I was like  alright here we go  wow  48 hours  ship change  shift change  I mean that was great  to be a single guy  tending bar  in Greece  that was awesome  did you hook up  with any girls  the Kiklades Islands  are amazing  one or two  one or two  they're amazing  yeah no  it was  you know  ever been to Santorini  yeah that's gorgeous 
[02:28:00]  isn't that amazing  that's gorgeous  and it was cheap  that was before the Euro  with the drachma  and it was a great  if you were  you know  a young kid  with a backpack  and stuff like that  that was fantastic  the whole city  or whatever  I guess it's not really  a city just built  right into the fucking  on the cliff face there  yeah  yep  the caldera  they just dug holes  into the rock  and a lot of these people  just lived like that  it's unreal  that was their houses  that's old school  that's old school  that's really old school  but the view you had 
[02:28:30]  and I'm sure  you stayed pretty cool  yeah  oh yeah  I'm sure it was fantastic  for them  no back door  but you know  that's an expensive island  though out of all of them  that one and Mykonos  are the expensive ones  Mykonos is nice  and that's why  everybody loves those islands  fucking pelicans  walk around in Mykonos  is it trying to eat  what you call  oh yeah  they go  they're always trying  to steal stuff  off the cafe tables  and stuff like that  I hate fucking pelicans  to this day  I thought they were cool  until I was trying  to eat lunch  I was trying to eat lunch  and they tried  to grab me a food  they 
[02:29:00]  yeah  I got a picture  I just had a picture  of me with one  and I wasn't comfortable  because I was afraid  the thing was going  to peck my eyes out  probably wanted to  I got a picture  on the back of his book  Brad Thor  oh yeah  look at me  leather jacket  is that your casual look  that's my casual look  yeah that's actually  yeah that's  just getting ready  to go to bed there  with the leather jacket  got the Glock  tucked in the waistband  in the back  you can't see that there  we were talking about that  before you went on the air  a little bit about  your lifestyle  you know  you're a go bag guy 
[02:29:30]  you know  you like being prepared  what is a go bag  go bag  so it's called  a bug up bag  go bag  if it hits the fan  let's say you've got  another 9-11 here  this thing is  under your desk  it's ready to go  it's going to be  the things you need  to hold you for 72 hours  or get you home  whatever the case may be  it's called  don't expect the government  to save your ass  bag  that's what that is  everything you need  for a couple of days  so what's in it  obviously a pistol  water  that's on you  pretzels  pretzels  a hat 
[02:30:00]  two novels  what's your luxury item  in your go bag  toothbrush  toothbrush  a lot of people forget that  a lot of people forget that  but think about it  I was here when the blackout happened  and the lights went out  and everybody's filling up the lobby  and I'm like  alright suckers  and I broke into the maid's cabinet  I got every waste basket I could  because I knew it was a gravity fed tank  on top of the roof  and the water was going to be gone soon  so guess who was still flushing his toilet  three days later  the guy that stole garbage cans  all these suckers were in the lobby  and then these chuckleheads 
[02:30:30]  figured well we can't go back up to our room  because the lights are out  the key cards won't work  it's battery powered on the door locks  it was amazing how  and so everybody stood around  expecting somebody to do something for them  so I filled the bathtub with water  and all that kind of stuff  and  people expect  yeah people expect like  well we're supposed to be taken care of  but that's the pussification of the American male  isn't it  I mean we've all been told  I mean I know guys that can't hang freaking pictures anymore  they need to call the handyman service  to come in and do it for their wives  it is amazing  everyone will sit  and we've seen these small little microcosms of 
[02:31:00]  of disasters that happen in various cities across the country  could you imagine a nationwide or a global disaster  that would really bring the people to their knees  where  where all right  for now we're screwed  but we know there's somebody  you know in another state  and soon they'll come and help  where you know no help is coming  look at Katrina  look at Sandy  I mean those are things where they knew the hurricanes were coming  yeah  I mean imagine if something happens  so my thing is  and people are cool for the first  what  three days maybe  tops 
[02:31:30]  I don't even think it was that long  I think we're at the point now  by the third day it's getting a little rough out there  we're courteous for maybe a day  and then  because when that gasoline started running out  people are not very courteous on lines anymore  but how many days was that?  two days in?  well the British  the British intelligence service says that people are four meals away from anarchy  you miss four meals  and then  yeah that's how they describe it  that's amazing right?  four meals  that's about right  well the average grocery store has enough  you know  nobody stockpiles stuff at grocery stores anymore  they're getting 16 to 27 deliveries a day 
[02:32:00]  so as you grab that last Wonder Bread  there's a truck in the back  bringing the new stuff  but they can't  they can't keep those store shelves stocked  if the trucks aren't moving  so  right  and I'm a father  so I'm a father  and I'm also a man  I want to take care of the people around me  my family  you know my kids don't care  if we've got an idiot running FEMA  if they're hungry  guess who they look to?  they're not going to look at whoever that guy is  and say  why isn't he getting those yummy MREs here fast enough?  you got to know  I think every guy needs basic knowledge of how to survive without a house to go around you 
[02:32:30]  in the woods away  know how to light a fire  know how to find wood  know how to build a shelter  I do think you should  I think manscaping is more important  I think the pomade  you know I think all that stuff is more important  yeah  and that's where we are as a society  we wonder why we're collapsing  know how to change a god damn tire  like there's certain things  I think every guy should know that  as we go on  how to adjust for windage and elevation 
[02:33:00]  that's important  I think that's important  my kids can do that  you know  and this is the thing  I talk to my SEAL buddies  and some of my other guys  in the special operations community  and they joke with me all the time  I had a couple of SEALs at my house  and they said  well Thor what are you going to do  if the wheels come off the bus  how are you going to set up  to shoot these guys outside  and I'm like well I'm going to sit here  and they're like no way  you never sit in the window  they're like you're going to be back  you're going to lay on your kitchen counter  because you've got a perfect view  out the window  and they're like  now we have to mark off the distances  and I'm like  what are we going to do 
[02:33:30]  they took Dora the Explorer stickers  from my daughter's room  and we now have them at 25 yards  we have them at 50 yards  we have Dora the Explorer stickers  on the back  like people's houses  yeah you can see it  you know where it is  there's Boots the Monkey  I know the guy's 100 yards now  oh man  how funny is that  that's great  now that's something  I realize I've got to do  I'm sure you have plenty  of those stickers laying around  Jimmy 
[02:34:00]  you always need a contingency plan  you know  that's it  got to be prepared  and you're down there  what do you do Jimmy  come on now  call down  and have  some of the doormen  in my luxury building  bring me comfort  I'm the worst  I'm prepared for nothing  nothing  I'm a gentleman  I would joke by way  throw it  Jimmy you're welcome  to come out to my house  thank you  but he's never going to get there alive  we'll bunker down there 
[02:34:30]  I would  I would drive out there  but everyone else would be driving  yeah that's the problem  you would have to walk at that point  grab a bike  you're going to need your  that's a bike will work  you probably have to have a contingency plan  a car would not work  if everything hits the fence  when is the last time  does anybody watch Walking Dead  haven't you seen  what the highways look like  right  well especially Manhattan  there's only a couple ways off  this damn island  can't even get around  there's no fucking way  your car would be  something you could use  steal a boat  steal a boat  is a pretty good plan  you could take out  one of these hedge fund managers  like that  those guys 
[02:35:00]  snapping like a toothpick  what about a whirlybird  if you know how to fly a helicopter  steal a whirlybird  I don't think  there's going to be many around  no  when's the last time  we had a global  I mean you have to be prepared for it  I guess  I don't have a family  so I don't even think about it  but the thing is  it's not always  realistically  it's not a global thing  it could be very localized  and you're still not getting help  for a while  we've been lucky  that there's still  that influx of fuel  albeit it was very slow  and food  and water  and what not  so that it wasn't this  all  you know  panicking 
[02:35:30]  breakdown of society  but there were some places  on the beach  that really didn't have water  and were wondering  where their food  is coming from  it changed Laszlo  yeah yeah yeah  he came in here  with a shaved head  yeah  so the world completely  Laszlo's a friend of ours  that had long hair forever  and after Hurricane Sandy  he came in with a shaved head  he went all Colonel Kurtz  on everybody  he was a changed man  after that hurricane  because he had a beach house  but it's a small area  but you gotta realize  if something  takes out  even the northeast 
[02:36:00]  that is bad  you are  you're in some shit  for a while  look Toronto's dealing  with flash floods  and blackouts today  so  yeah  so they got  their little issue  I get goofed  you get goofed on  for that  you know what  all the time  and you have to  you have to think of  security  I mean how many people  do you want to know  that you're all squared away  yeah yeah  you know I've got good neighbors  and they're pretty squared away  and then I've got some  how vulgar can we get  on this show  oh pretty vulgar 
[02:36:30]  I got some relatives  they're absolute shitbags  that they can't say that  can I say balls  everything but clithood  you can say  so yeah  you gotta be careful  listen at the end  I got nailed  for using the cliche  Bill O'Reilly  made fun of me  for something  at the end of the day  yeah he was  the whole line  of people that said that  I want to be able  to take care of my wife  take care of my kids  take care of myself  the last thing  I want to be  is dependent  upon my government  to come to my rescue 
[02:37:00]  because it ain't  going to happen  I've seen it over  and over and over again  not that I expect  anything to happen  but you know  I wear a seatbelt  I don't expect  to get in an accident  I get a fire extinguisher  it's a natural extension  that's what people  that's the same reason  I wear diapers  where's your go bag now  it is downstairs  in the car  see  it's not going to help you  oh it will  he'll get there  he'll get to your car  tuck and roll  I think I can get to it  kick something in  you think you can  I can get out of this building  what if the elevators 
[02:37:30]  don't work  I'm going down the stairs  what if they're on fire  what if they're on fire  smoky  smoky elevators  and stairwells  we're in big trouble  yo Wallace  from The Wire  oh that is  Wallace  does he want to come  and say hi  what is Wallace  he's got a  Jimmy just ran out  to get a picture  of Jimmy  he's got a movie  yo Wallace  he's got a movie  yo Wallace  yo  so Jim went to get a picture  but not invite him in  to get on the show  this would be good  yo Wallace  alright here we go 
[02:38:00]  let's see  do you mind  no I don't mind  The Wire is one of our  let's have him read  from Hidden Order  how about that  there you go  good sales for the book  we just want to say hi  no  not at all  not at all  how you doing man  huge fans of  The Wire  absolutely  what are you promoting  Michael B. Jordan  Fruitville Station  huh  Fruitville Station  comes out July 26th  in theaters  it's by Oscar Grant  the kid up in Oakland  I was shot and killed  by the BART transit police  back in 2009  that looks crazy  okay  I should check it out  right on  we will  it looks very suspenseful 
[02:38:30]  I couldn't believe  you were only in  it's a heavy pit  it's a heavy one  it sticks with you  after it man  I'll give him the mic  for a second  for one second  me and Jimmy  couldn't believe  you were only in  one season of The Wire  I mean Jimmy was  talking about it  and I'm like  he was only in  the first season  of The Wire  I mean like  you know when you  get that knock on  your trailer  about David Simon  you know it's  something bad  oh no  he kind of showed up  and was like  hey mate  we love you  you're going to be  fine though  everybody loves you  that's the reason  why we gotta kill you  you gotta kill the  heart of the show  sometimes man  oh man  how bummed were you 
[02:39:00]  because it was so  unexpected  I was sad  because it was like  a family  you know everybody  on the show  you know you're  growing up  I was like 15  at the time  so you know  I was young  not knowing  what's going to  happen next  but you know  you just got to  take that leap of  faith and move on  to the next project  so they killed me off  and then I jumped  on the soap  for four years  and that's kind of  where I learned  my chops  100 pages a day  it's kind of like  that quick pace  it seems impossible  is that how they  told you you were  going to die  they just kind of  knock on the trailer  and say  today's the day  each script that you  get you're kind of  like just skimming  through to make sure 
[02:39:30]  you see your name  at the end  did I take it  as soon as I started  seeing I was like  taking drugs  and stuff  I was like  okay Wallace  is going  and then you get  that infamous  knock on your door  and it's just like  oh David Simon  nobody wants to  see that guy  so yeah  then that was  pretty much it  that's brutal  made an impression  though sir  my manager  flew next to you  on a plane  my manager  Jonathan  he said he sat  next to you  on a plane  what's that  coming from  can  it might have  been Jonathan  yeah he's a  really weird guy  but he said 
[02:40:00]  he talked to you  the whole time  and you're a  very nice guy  he makes no  impact  so it's not  surprising  he does not  leave  is this your  agent  or your manager  my manager  I actually have  a photo with him  they're getting  nervous out there  no we just  want to say  hi  I appreciate  the love  man  come back  and do  it's great  we'll hook  something up  legitimately  you'll come back  again  42S  cool man  well you're a great actor  man thank you  absolutely  thanks so much  no worries  good luck with the movie  yeah absolutely  and it comes out 
[02:40:30]  I think this Friday  you said right  26  oh wow  my way off  thank you  you're welcome  but you know  what comes out today  yes  hidden order  hidden order  Thor thriller  yes it does  a thriller  by Thor's new book  you do one a year  I guess huh  I do do one a year  that's about what  you want to do  yeah that's the  business model  with the publisher  smart  yeah well you know  it's tough  I mean to get  one out a year  it's really hard  are they making  them into movies yet  we had a development  deal with Warner Brothers  we get a script  written and I'm  waiting to see  what happens 
[02:41:00]  so that's a  that's a good step  but you know  what I'll believe it  when I'm sitting  in the movie theater  watching it  Hollywood is a  you know  that should be  it's own planet  out there  those guys think  the world works  completely opposite  the way it does  they make these  absolutely crappy  anti-american movies  and wonder why  people in Manhattan  and LA are the  only ones buying  the tickets  how come we're  not selling in  Texas  god  because you know  it's the same  I don't even mind  that message if it's  delivered in a smart  or interesting way  but it's the same  trite boring  predictable sentiment 
[02:41:30]  every fucking  time  and it gets  irritating  it's not delivered  in a way that I  find interesting  it's like I get it  we're terrible  just at least make  it an interesting  it doesn't make  any sense to me  I mean this nation  is the greatest  force for good  in the history  of the world  I mean you look  at everything  we have made it  better in this  by this country's  existence  and we're the only  free truly free  country in the world  everything else  is dictatorships  communist regimes  or highly socialized  states like Canada  France England  Germany 
[02:42:00]  so I mean we really  we're the last stand  I mean everybody  wants this  we're being told  all the time now  that you know  we gotta be like  the rest of them  no we don't  the rest of them  need to be like us  we're based on  you know what the  smallest minority  is in the world  it's the individual  and this is the only  country that preserves  the rights of the  individual  and that's what  capitalism does  and I'm tired of  this fair share  bullshit  99  1%  you know what  this country's  about the 100%  you get off your  ass  you work hard  I mean I met  you in a red eye  Jim  I mean we 
[02:42:30]  flew on that plane  you were doing a show  and they were coming  back so you could do  this show in the morning  so you're working  hard  I mean how many clubs  have you been in your life  I mean that's the story  of America  there's no promise  nobody came here  because the lamp of liberty  was shooting dollar bills  at it  you know what I mean  $100 bills  it's here  you come here  you work hard  I was telling you  off camera  that a guy that's done  some work at my house  great guy named Kevin  is a huge fan of the show  and the guy works  his ass off  yeah yeah  and that blows me away  the guys that work for him  and he's a success story  he's got his own business 
[02:43:00]  he comes and goes  as he wants  but he works hard  that's what this country's about  there's no promise  of you can get a check  no there seems to be  people think there's a guarantee  yeah they think  their bill of rights  there's actually a right  to not be offended  there's a right to  housing and food  education and a job  but there's not  it's great that it's available  if you work for certain things  you get certain things  but there's too many people  thinking yeah  that it's just  and they honestly think 
[02:43:30]  it's just the way it is  you're supposed to get it  I've gotten  and again  I agree with you  to a certain degree  I've gotten really irritated  with the country though  like because  it seems that we always  there's always a group  that has to fight  to get what they're supposed  like you know what I mean  like with gay marriage  is the issue now  and before that  it was this  and before that  it was that  and it's almost like  why do we always  is there one group  that has to fight  to get what they're supposed  to get  like it's starting  to bug me  a lot  that we tell everybody else 
[02:44:00]  how to live  and yet we have  so many inconsistencies  here in the way  I think it just goes  with the basic gist  of the populace  and what is  accepted and not  and what people like  and don't like  and want and don't like  as long as it doesn't  interfere with your rights  this thing in Cairo  and Syria  and all this kind of stuff  you know  I heard a great line once  which is  you can't bring  democracy to a country  that has more goats  than flush toilets  and I thought  that was a pretty  good line  but it was pretty good 
[02:44:30]  you know  I look at the whole  NSA spying scandal thing  in this  so the NSA  listening to our phone calls  reading our emails  which I had in my  thriller last summer  and I look at this  and somebody raised  a great point  last week  which is  so let me get this straight  it's an inconvenience  for our security  is what we're being told  hundreds of millions  of Americans  being inconvenienced  to keep us safe  well let me  let me ask you something  none of us in this room  are going to stop  Islamic terrorism  but yet we're being inconvenienced  I got an idea  before you inconvenience me  and listen in on all my stuff  and make my life  even the slightest 
[02:45:00]  inconvenient  why don't you inconvenience  the population  from which these terrorists come  how about that  how about  let's  we're all nice  good Americans  but let's inconvenience  good Muslims  so that they get ticked off  at their jihadist cousins  brothers and sisters  and say stop bombing  because I can't get a visa  to get into the United States  because you're such an idiot  so if we're going to inconvenience anybody  why doesn't the federal government  go and look to inconvenience  others  rather than its own citizens  why  I can't change that  I can't change people  bombing and blowing themselves up  yet  you're going to inconvenience me 
[02:45:30]  who the heck  is the federal government  looking out for  yeah  I don't like the idea  that's a great take  I don't like the idea  of all this aid  going out there also  the billion dollars a year  to Egypt makes me sick  Egypt at this point  when you don't even know  who the hell's running  the show over there  there shouldn't be  any money going over there  well what do we get  I remember in 2011  February 2011  was when President Obama  was saying  it's time for Mubarak to go  well how's that working out for us  yeah  how's that  what are we getting  I mean listen  he was a  he might have been a bad guy  he was our bad guy 
[02:46:00]  at the end of the day  the president's job  is not to promote democracy  first in Egypt  it's to look out for our interests  and then you cozy up  with the Mo Bros over there  those guys are bad actors  yeah  this is going to bite us in the butt  we've been doing that for years though  and it drives me  it's the same thing  we did it in fucking Vietnam  we did it in Korea  minding everybody's business  and trying to  it's not our  I don't care  what Syria does  I don't care how they treat  their citizens  because it doesn't  it's not my business  let them rise up  and throw over their own government 
[02:46:30]  I'm not interested  in one more American life  being lost  because we helped out  in Afghanistan in the 80s  and look what happened  then people are like  well you are in Bin Laden  well yeah  it's because we were kind of helping  and we had a common enemy  in the Soviets  yeah that's it too  no one wants to look at the context  of these relations  that we've had over the years  you know  there was a cold war going on  during Vietnam  you could say  ah why do we go there  well at the time  it seemed like  the right thing to do  to stop the advance of communism  especially with  you know  so many allies down there 
[02:47:00]  in the South Pacific  and what not  you know  you don't want them  getting a real foothold  and ah  you look now  and it's like  oh it's terrible  we shouldn't have been there  again context  you know  all that shit  that we did  during the 80s  and stuff  you gotta look at it  for what it was  I don't mind self interest  I'm fine with it  because every country  acts in self interest  we're hardwired as human beings  to act  absolutely  what I don't like  is the dishonesty  in the motives  that drives me nuts  just say what we're doing 
[02:47:30]  like who  fuck Kuwait  I don't care if Iraq  takes over Kuwait  it was Saudi Arabia  we were looking after  just say that  like I don't give a shit  about the Kuwaiti people  I don't give a shit  about the Iraqis  the Afghanistan  they don't care  or like us  how do we not get a dime  how do we not get a dime  back from Iraq  to pay for all that stuff  hey we liberated you guys  and by the way  as soon as we're done  paying off the debt  you can have your oil fields back  why are we ashamed  that you have no blood  for oil  guess what  there was a lot of blood  how about no blood  for nothing  yeah we should have been 
[02:48:00]  pumping oil out of there  and paying our own way  yeah and guess what  we got 17 trillion dollars  in debt  so there's a little interest  on the war bill fellas  yeah yeah  so as soon as that debt's gone  then you can have the oil fields back  that could have been paid for  yeah exactly  does Media Matters  watch this show  because I can now see the headlines  Brad Thor wants to take over  I mean they're all full of Media Matters  they're just  you know again  they're like a fucking  just a biased special interest group  going into the guise of being  a bunch of monkeys in house coats  sitting in the basement  typing away 
[02:48:30]  trying to act like they're  they're unbiased  and they're trying to be fair  that's just sickening  yeah  oh boy  it sure seems grim  doesn't it  when you sit here  and chat like this  you know what  when you go outside  and it's nice out  it's a nice beautiful day today  you'll be jumping in a pool  birds are tweeting  yeah  birds are tweeting  I do have a dentist appointment  but inside the world  it's coming to an end here  yeah yeah  inside here  we've got our go bags  and a new book  and we're ready to go  how does the book end  inside  you know what's funny  can I just read the last page  on the air for everybody  you wrote it  you know the book 
[02:49:00]  actually  it opens up  with a quote from Kennedy  and closes  with a very upbeat  optimistic quote from Reagan  because I wanted to end  the book on that note  so  yep  and  the quote  what was the quote  the quote from Kennedy  was let me wipe this off  Jackie's coming in  you know  I'll read  it doesn't end  with a quote from Reagan  no no  you're in the  you're in the epilogue  I'll read the  the end of the final chapter  epilogue  as the  basically  chapter 73  huh  chapter 73 
[02:49:30]  I'm on page  oh you're right  epilogue  Cape Cod  sorry  you're right  that's where the hero  gets the girl  so 370  but the bottom of 370  if you want to read it  opi or I will  no I'm not going to do that to you  no no  this doesn't give it away  but this is the president  and as he walked him slowly  to the door of the Oval Office  he left them with one final thought  and the president said  a man who occupied this office  years ago  once said that  freedom is never more  than one generation  away from extinction  we didn't pass it to the  to our children  in the bloodstream  it must be fought for 
[02:50:00]  protected  and handed on for them  to do the same  or one day  we'll spend our sunset years  telling our children  and our children's children  what it was once like  in the United States  when men were free  he then shook their hands  and said  I'm glad to know  that you'll both be with me  in this fight  he just read the  that's the end of the book  so we know it all works out  in the end  you don't know  who he's talking to  you have no idea  I guarantee a high body count  lots of explosions  bullets  who's uh  who are we talking about  as far as bad guys  in this  so uh 
[02:50:30]  with this  so in hidden order  my new book  uh  I  so last summer's book  Blacklist  I was talking about the NSA  and how everything's  I wove that in  I do fiction  and I want you to have  that great beach read  white knuckle thrill ride  but when you close the book  your heart's not only pumping  but you say  you know what  I'm actually smarter  for having read this  Brad Thor book  I learned something  smarter from reading  yep  how about that  what I'm sad about  that about  we're gonna get smarter  bumper stickers with that  so with this book  what I wanted to do  was uh 
[02:51:00]  9-11  as I started saying  we got stranded  and I found out about this group  more secretive than the NSA  more secretive than the CIA  and some people say  more powerful than the US government  and it's their 100 year birthday  this year  they've been around for 100 years  they're a total failure  they pretend to be part of the government  and it's the Federal Reserve  they're about as federal as Federal Express  and it's  for a thriller writer  just  the research I did  this stuff  it's like it was ripped out of a spy novel  these guys purposely  tried to mislead the American people 
[02:51:30]  they snuck out  way back in the 1900s  they snuck out of Hoboken, New Jersey  in the middle of the night  on a private train car  using fake names  went down to Jekyll Island  off the coast of Georgia  and cooked up this whole  Federal Reserve thing  and it's fascinating  because there was all this subterfuge  and it exists to this day  all of us  know very little about it  and that's on purpose  Bill Barr does  Bill Barr's right about that  Bill Barr was yapping about the Fed  the Illuminati  for quite a while  we know  there's some fascinating  fascinating things  and who's behind the Fed  so I said  can I take a beach read 
[02:52:00]  weave these guys in  and give people  an absolute edge of their seat ride  and that's what I attempted to do  with Hidden Order  and you're proud of this book  I'm very proud of it  I actually think it's the best thing  I've ever written  and I think  I'm going to be  off the Fed's Christmas card list  but I think  how do you write your books?  meaning do you go somewhere  do you spend just an hour here  an hour there  like you  I'm a dad  so I'll get the kids  you know  off to school in the morning  and I'll  you know  I'll run or work out  or something like that  then I'm at the desk  at home  and I sit there 
[02:52:30]  and it's  listen  it's the story of success  in any business  it's seat of pants  the seat of chair  I'm working hard  do you have to be  inspired  because I'm weird when I write  like I can't just make myself write  but can you  like I think Stephen King will do that  he'll sit down and go  I have to write from 9 to 1  can you do that?  Jack London said  you can't wait for inspiration  you have to go after it  with a club  and that's  that's true  so yeah  do you get frustrated  where you just know  you're writing a lot of shit  or stuff that  you know  will never make the book  you know what's hard for me  is I never cheat 
[02:53:00]  never cheat  I never have any  deus ex machina  where something  pops up suddenly  to solve the problem  I paint my guy  into corners all the time  and he's got to get himself out  and I also do my homework  nothing ticks me off more  and I know it does for you  you see a safety on a glock  or something stupid like that  I do my homework  and that's why I'm so proud  that I hear from active marines  I hear from SEALs  I hear from guys in Delta  who say  you know what  this is exactly the kind of stuff  we're facing  your guy does it  exactly the way we do it  he's got the right gear 
[02:53:30]  and that for me  is a real compliment  when the men and women  are out there  away from the flagpole  doing some of this nation's  most dangerous business  Brad Thorne's getting it right  that takes you out of the book  or movie  in my case  movies mostly  but then when you see something  that just is out of context  or it's not right  it's not portrayed right  I guess it's a continuity problem  or what not  when you're right  do you know exactly  how it all is going to  I don't  so that's cool  so you will just go with it  and it's the experience  for me writing it  is what I hope  you're getting reading it 
[02:54:00]  because I don't know  what's going to happen next  so I get there  and I know I've got to  write the next chapter  and I'm thinking to myself  okay I want a big surprise  I want to be shocked here  as a reader  so what's the most shocking  thing I can come up with  in the next chapter  flying saucers  flying saucers  everybody wakes up  with a hat  that they can't take off  how ridiculous  he turns that into  his publisher  yeah they're all  waiting for doors  that won't come off  you guys next week  you'll see me pushing  a garbage can  and a broom around here  I'm going to turn that  into the next book  so you've got  pleasant surprises 
[02:54:30]  because then you  surprise yourself  sometimes  oh wow wait  I'm going to go  in this direction  for a while  this was a big risk  for me when I decided  to become a writer  because I didn't know  was this going to go  anywhere  was I going to get  a contract  so it was a big risk  I took a big chance  and I love my job  I absolutely love it  it's the hardest thing  I've ever done  because I tell people  you know what  I'll never waste your money  and I'll never waste your time  you can make 30 bucks  20 bucks  whatever it is  to buy a new book  but you can't get  that time back  that you've given me  to read one of my books 
[02:55:00]  so just like the guy  I talked about Kevin  who put the windows in  at my house  who listens to your show  you know what  Kevin's working his butt off  he's giving me  the best he can  Kevin's going to buy  one of my books  why isn't it incumbent  upon me  you can't give him  a free book  I was just going to say  why wouldn't you  throw one at Kevin  or whatever  at your house  like he's doing them for free  Kevin ain't expensive  I didn't take  we don't call him  low bid Kevin  okay  Kevin's expensive  how about we give  Kevin a book today  sign one over to Kevin  we're going to sign  Norton's book to you today  I understand you want  everyone to work  actually it was Opie's idea 
[02:55:30]  we'll sign Opie's book to you  I understand you want  everyone to work hard  in this country  but how about you  give Kevin a little break  everybody thinks  the author gets tons of books  everybody thinks  so the same family members  are going to show up  to eat my children's food  when the apocalypse happens  they're all the ones  lined up first  for free books  and then alone  and then while I'm here  hey can you sign that  little little Billy  needs a leg brace  that's 500 bucks  it's always the worst thing  like Johnny Dangerously  you know  grandma needs  brand new ice  it's going to be 60,000  can you write a check? 
[02:56:00]  and how long does it take  to write a book?  not a whole year right?  no  it depends on  the research  and sometimes  you'll get those days  my goal is to get  2,500 words written a day  so some days  how many pages is that?  5 single space pages  a day  a day  Monday to Friday  I got kids like you  and I'm trying to be  a good dad  and a good husband  some days it comes  some days it doesn't come  oh man  yeah  sometimes you just sit there  in front of it  and just nothing  you know I've always found  the tangents are good though 
[02:56:30]  like  and again I don't write  like you do  I write just kind of  non-fiction  like little vignette  shitty things  that have happened to me  but  like something will happen  where you start to go off  on a tangent  and I'm almost afraid  I'm going to be  overwhelmed by it  like it's just too much  and then I'm like  just go with it  and a lot of times  that's more interesting  than I was originally  going to write  is where you wind up  going off  in some weird direction  there is a certain amount  of discipline you've got to have  because there's structure  in books  but probably the best  and worst thing  to ever happen to an author  is the internet  I can get great research  or I can go to look 
[02:57:00]  at a missile  on Jane's defense  and four hours later  I'm watching midget wrestling  from Tijuana  and I'm going  when's the donkey coming on  when's the halftime show  and it's bad  it's bad stuff  you know you talked  about cheating  I like  Stephen King mentioned  that it was in Misery  and there was a great moment  where Kathy Bates  you know that fucking wacko  is so mad at the author  because he wrote a book  that the girl died  in the book  and that's why she kidnaps  and so she's angry  Misery Chastain  yes  and then he makes her alive  and she goes  you cheated 
[02:57:30]  because like  the analogy  that Psycho used  was that when  she hated when TV shows  when a car goes off the cliff  and oh my god  it's the cliffhanger  the star is dead  but then the next week  they show him  rolling out of the car  before it goes off the cliff  but you're like  no  that's not what happened  you're cheating  because last week  he went off the cliff  well you're really sympathizing  with her aren't you  I really am  I relate to her  relationship with celebrities  it's why  I saw the movie  Olympus Has Fallen  and I like Gerard Butler  and everything  and I saw that movie  and there were so many 
[02:58:00]  inconsistencies  and cheats in there  the action was great  but this guy's off  the president's detail  secret service detail  for 18 months  yet all his passcodes  still work at the White House  it's like dude  you haven't even hit  Pennsylvania Avenue  and all that stuff's gone  you know  and then when the terrorists  come in in an airplane  they've got a machine gun  thing up on the top  of the White House  that shoots at the airplane  and that doesn't work  and then the whole thing  the White House  gets taken over  but somehow later  when the Navy SEALs show up  oh wait  we have this missile system  up on the roof  and the terrorists  can use that  to shoot the SEAL helicopters 
[02:58:30]  but they didn't use it earlier  yeah exactly  they could have fixed it  yeah what if they  it wasn't running  they fixed it  sequester  sequester  wasn't available  wasn't available  until after 7pm  on a Friday  sequester  that's all  to worry about  well I hope your book  has realistic bad guys  like that last mission  impossible  because the Russians  and the launch codes  I thought was  extremely topical  for 2012  that was good  it's very  most of it  most of the book  is set in Boston  which was fun for me  to research and do 
[02:59:00]  so  well you lived in Boston  I love Boston  yeah it's a great  one of my favorite places  and I was just  the other day saying  I need to read a book  this summer  guess what  you came in  perfect timing  you're on the beach  boom you're on the beach  you're sitting there  you're reading a book  I need to read  and get off that  fucking Twitter  yeah  I'm gonna start reading again  I used to read a book  every two weeks  easy  it's tough  I was good for 20  25 books a year  wow  I was  and not anymore  well you know  I'll tell you something  since you've got kids  one of the things  I grew up hearing  is if you read to your kids 
[02:59:30]  they're gonna become  great readers  read in that book  Freakonomics  it's got the apple  with the slice out of it  and looks like an orange inside  that's the cover on Freakonomics  and these guys studied it  and they said  you know what's a greater  determinant of  whether or not  your children will be readers  as they grow up  if they see you reading  that's more important  than reading to them  every night before they go to bed  that's a great thing to do  it's great bonding  with your kids  but your kids will emulate  that behavior  if they see you  with the book  and reading  we watch  Team Umizumi together  with the troublemakers  does swank count? 
[03:00:00]  right  just cracking open  the old  copy of swank  yeah  with the staples  in the middle  yeah  that's not gonna  I gotta turn off  the cartoons  yeah maybe you gotta read  I get very excited  when On Demand  has a new Team Umizumi  to watch  oh god  what happened?  I get lazy  it's fun  I hate Caillou  did you go through  a Caillou stage  with your kids?  how old are your kids?  my kids are 8 and 10  so you went through 
[03:00:30]  a Caillou stage  we were particular  I don't even know  if that stuff was out  when my kids were out  we were trying to find  stuff that we liked  that was okay  for them to watch  the networks  it's funny now  I'm still particular  about what I expose  my kids to  and the only network  that doesn't have  bad commercials  is Food Network  really?  what do you mean  bad commercials?  commercials that I  think don't put  things there  you're more bothered  by commercials?  some of the commercials  just put stuff out there  in scenarios that I don't  necessarily see  my kids seeing right now 
[03:01:00]  things like that  like what?  what commercials?  this is fascinating  well I'm trying to think  of some of the bad ones  since we don't watch  a ton of commercial TV  the ones with sexual content?  yeah that kind of stuff  yeah and there's just  we're trying to keep  our kids innocent  for as long as we can  we're not going to raise  a couple of hayseeds  you know that don't  know how the rest  of the world works  but I want it to be  on our time  as we think they're ready  you know and there's  always teases for the news  and we live in Chicago  oh my god  the violence in Chicago  is terrible 
[03:01:30]  I don't want my kids  freaking out  I mean they're smart  you know my kids  know what to do  if a bad guy shows up  and tries to grab him  you know you're supposed  to yell  if that doesn't work  you tell them your father  is going to find him  and is going to kill him  and your father doesn't  care if he goes to jail  your father will kill  the bad guys  you make sure they know that  say you know  go for the neighbor's kids  their dad's a woman  that's what my kids  have been taught  their daughter's  prettier than I am  sir  I agree  what do you think of Chicago  and all the violence  up there  you know what  I think it's  it's on the news  every night right  absolutely  listen we had 
[03:02:00]  four guardian angels  get knifed  outside our back door  of our building  in Chicago  we had a district attorney  we call them  state's attorneys there  this guy 6 o'clock  on a Thursday  went down to the beach  he was off work  he was going to the beach  I don't know if he was  going fishing or whatever  there were two gay men  there that were being  hassled by a couple of  thugs  he tried to step in  and say hey  leave these guys alone  these two thugs  took beer bottles  smashed them  and sliced the state's  attorney to ribbons  26 year old kid  no he survived  but this is the kind of  stuff that's happening  every day  no this is downtown 
[03:02:30]  Chicago where I live  no that's what I'm saying  it's your building  you live in  well it was the beach  where the state's  no I know  but the other incident  outside the building  where the four guardian  angel guys got slashed  yeah that was right  outside our back door  how about your move  well we're looking at  Tennessee  we're looking at  Texas  we're looking at  a bunch of different  places  I think the books  are doing well  Chicago's just insane  at this point  the body count  that comes out of there  every weekend  more dangerous than  Iraq and Afghanistan  yeah  it absolutely is  you know I said 
[03:03:00]  I was going to wait  for the last election  and see what my fellow  citizens in Illinois  decided to do  because we have the  worst bond ratings  in the country  in Illinois  worse than California  we just found out  last week  that the government  had been lying again  about how poorly funded  the pensions are  by 65%  it's the Titanic  honest mistake  yeah  you carry the one  whoops  oh gosh  just like Geithner  and I didn't do my taxes  but I'd love to run  the treasury  there's no  so they voted in  the same idiots  that are causing the problems  and we just  my wife and I said  and she got very sick 
[03:03:30]  at the beginning of the year  so we were going to move  this year  and she spent a lot  at the beginning of the year  in the hospital  unfortunately  she's better now  but  so we committed  to one more year  of school  and we're getting out of there  get out of there  but let me ask you this  when are the people  going to be fed up  and do something about this  because we just  continued taking it  well they continued  to take it in Detroit  too didn't they  and they look at the way  Chicago will be Detroit  and Chicago will be  and you really think  the people could  rise up when it's time  the people don't care  I know that's right  the people don't care  and here's 
[03:04:00]  there was an interesting  white paper that came out  that said  people who live in cities  and areas with corrupt government  that's been there for a while  are less apt to fight  to change it  number one  because they're used to it  number two  they say it's been this way forever  how am I going to change it  if it could have been changed  I tried for a while  I was supporting candidates  and working on campaigns  and I finally said  it's not worth my family's safety  it's not worth my safety  the great thing about the states  and the way that  our republic is set up  you can move  and money is portable  jobs  your job is the hardest thing  I can move though 
[03:04:30]  I'm fortunate  can Kevin  my wonderful guy  Kevin  can Kevin move  and start his business  someplace else  yeah it might be tough  I give him a huge recommendation  can you imagine  Brad Thor  on the side of his truck  that would be nice  sponsored by  Brad Thor  it really is amazing  you have to  literally pick up and leave  because the city you live in  has deteriorated  but I will not go quietly  into that good night  I can't stand  Rahm Emanuel  I can't stand  that idiot governor  Quinn 
[03:05:00]  that we have in our state  and I am going to lead  this fun thing  I'm talking to a couple of  groups in Illinois  I said let's pick the day  anybody wants to leave  let's see if we can get  all the moving trucks  going on the same day  and anybody else  who's thinking about moving  let's do a caravan  like Smokey and the Bandit  or Cannonball Run  let's do to the state line  let's have  so the news  will have to cover it  let's get a thousand cars  and let's tie green streamers  all over them  to represent the money  that is going to be  leaving Illinois  and let's all drive  even if it's people 
[03:05:30]  who aren't going to move  but who want to  and let's do something symbolic  and let's take all these cars  and cross the state line  into Indiana  from Illinois  and just send a message  these guys  there's no repercussions  they keep getting re-elected  they're kicking the can  down the road  and Illinois  is a great state  Chicago is a beautiful city  great people there  but they got a bunch  of idiots running it  and the stupid voters  keep voting the people  back in  they keep voting them back in  it's like tinkling in the ocean  when I go to the polls  in that city  yeah yeah  you can't make any difference  people snicker  you want the Republican ballot 
[03:06:00]  yeah  but do you think  there's better  you really think  there are better candidates  that just aren't getting elected  or are they all the same  shitty people  no people don't stand up  Plato was famous  for saying that  smart men who avoid politics  will end up being governed  by dumber men  and that's the problem  and that's  I mean Plato said that  and that's what's happening  in Illinois  people are convinced  that it's so corrupt there  that even good people  couldn't win  and that's a problem  we came very close  in our last governor's election  it was like less than  a tenth of a percent  to get rid of the  the chucklehead 
[03:06:30]  that's in Springfield now  this guy's just a moron  I can't stand him  and he's ruining our state  he's ruining our state  and what also ticks me off  there are good people  you may not agree  with the pensions  and the size of the deals  then let's work on  getting the new people  different deals  but the people  there are some crooked deals  that need to be tossed out  but there are people  who are retired  there are people  who have worked their butts off  cops, firemen  other people  who have put salt on our roads  so our cars don't get  in accidents in the wintertime  who have done that  knowing that this is the deal  they've planned their lives  they've planned their retirements  sending their kids to college 
[03:07:00]  all this kind of stuff  that's a promise  we have made to them  we honor that promise  we need to find a way  to honor promises  to those people  I'd love to take it out  of a politician's high  to make that  how about out of Egypt  how about the billion  we send to that shit house  we just put back into pensions  yeah yeah  would you ever run for office  this is plenty of money  we're wasting  no I like doing radio  Jimmy  Jimmy  you talk like a politician  you talk like a politician  look at the dog doing that  don't you wish you could do that  well aren't you afraid  he'd bite you  it's a great  you talk like a politician though 
[03:07:30]  would you ever run  you know what  I can't stand politicians  that'd be my  that'd be my platform  that I'd need a shower  in my office  to have to wipe off  all the scum  from dealing with politicians  on a daily basis  you know at some point  I think you can't sit back  and complain  unless you're willing  to do something about it  so at this point  I finally  you know I've been to  so many rallies  because I've been so ticked off  about government  and how messed up it is  and I've been to all these rallies  and I walk away  like oh I'm excited  we're going to change things  and nobody's told me  how to change it  and I finally said  I gave a speech  last Saturday  first time ever 
[03:08:00]  about how do we do it  what do we do  and I'm now convinced  it happens at the precinct level  it happens at the  the smallest level  of voting  that exists  in a state  and I think that  that's the way  to really do it  and that's going to be  my new thing  is I want to  turn other people on  to here's how we do it  here's how we take things over  but would I like to run  for office at some point  yeah I probably would  you can't sit back  and complain  and you're not going  to corrupt me  I'm going to be the guy  that goes in and says  no I don't want  the gold plated  I got a health care plan 
[03:08:30]  I mean I got a private thing  I pay for my family  and everything  I'll go and take a dollar  it used to be a matter  of honor to go serve  not a career  I got to tell you  I was just at  Morning Joe  on MSNBC  I had to stand there  next to that slime bag  Spitzer  Spitzer  I almost threw up  what is with this guy  and it's not only Democrats  like Spitzer and Wiener  it's also that Mark Sanford  in South Carolina  the governor  these people can do nothing  but go to the trough  in the power  of being a politician  they can't do anything else  they fail 
[03:09:00]  and then they try to come back  they obviously had their issues  like go move on  do something else  but they always have to come back  to that power base  why should we trust you again  a politician  did you confront him  while you were on Morning Joe  I wasn't on with him  he was on before me  and I get a feeling  that if I dusted it up  with that loser  in the green room  I would have gotten bounced  so  I gotta be honest  I don't think we should judge them  on the fact  if they are doing that  as long as they're not pedophiles  as far as that stuff  I think we as a country 
[03:09:30]  put too much emphasis  on what people are doing  for me it's the lying  I don't care  if you want to cheat on your wife  because apparently  Wiener's wife doesn't care  that he was doing that stuff  she stuck with him  Clinton's wife didn't care  she stuck with him  it's not that  the cover up is always worse  than the crime  and Spitzer was going after  everyone else  doing exactly what he was doing  Spitzer was a prick  Spitzer was a frickin  wasn't he the  attorney here  he was going after  all the Wall Street firms  and everything  this guy was a law enforcement officer  for lack of a better word 
[03:10:00]  this guy was out  prosecuting people  and he was breaking the law  for pretty much  doing what he was doing  and he was going after  radio guys  for plugola  that's that whole  that's that whole mentality  though  there's a weird power thing  with politicians  and they do it  like look at  Larry Craig  was that guy  with the wide stance  yeah  they're all deviants  some of the older guys  might not be  some of the real old dudes  but they're all pigs  on some level  none of them can keep  their dick in their pants  it's a lust for power  and I get it  believe I'm a pig  on my level 
[03:10:30]  if I was a governor  it's all I would do  you tweet not your junk  but I would though  you know what I mean  it's like  now with technology  a lot of them  are getting caught  or they're leaving  paper trails  whereas they didn't  50 years ago  and everybody kept  their mouths shut  can you imagine if JFK  had the fucking press  that we have today  well see that's  that's what I love  yeah  that there's a certain  group in this country  that's all against  sexual harassment  unless it's committed  by a Clinton or a Kennedy  and then it's okay  you know what I mean  sexual harassment's bad  but that's different  well what was  Kissinger's line was  power is the ultimate 
[03:11:00]  aphrodisiac  that's what Kissinger said  it's gotta be hard  when you're used to  going after and getting  what you want  you know what I mean  like I don't fault  any of those guys  as long as they're not  forcing people  as long as they're not  but again I know  it makes them blackmailable  so I know there's  a certain detriment  but it's interesting  because there was  an FBI profiler  that wanted to find  the most likely pool  in American society  for psychopaths  and he looked at  mechanics  he looked at  school teachers  gym teachers  he looked at  everything  and the closest pool  that he said  that they would be  likeliest to find  psychos  was politicians 
[03:11:30]  because they'll look  in the eye  like Ted Bundy  and the Lydia  they'll be charming  and they have  absolutely no remorse  radio hosts came in  I was going to say  I saw that list  I did see the list  and radio hosts  and talk show hosts  are up there too  oh I thought that  was the obvious joke  but we actually  made the list  yeah they're up there  yeah yeah  it's a good one  but yeah politicians  that makes perfect sense  power hungry douches  yeah  it's your remorse  so do we make it  cheerier  amazing  I love it  I love when you come in  Brad  you've got to come in  more than once a year 
[03:12:00]  well you know  last year  you ever in New York  I'm going to start  coming more often  I'd love to be on the show  and you guys last year  it was the first time  I'd done the show  and my Twitter following  blew up  oh great  I couldn't believe  and we were talking  about that off air  about how many people  more than anything else  people wanted to know  am I going to be on  the Opie and Anthony show  this year  they're like  you're going to be on  make sure you get on  it's Brad Thor on Twitter  right  correct  Brad Thor on Twitter  how many books  you got out now  this is my 13th  Jesus  lucky 13  hidden order  yeah in bookstores

[03:17:30]  I'm trying to command a show here  866-WOW-1-WOW  is the phone number to call today  I got two  big prizes  which O.P. informed me  are of equal value  I guess you could  that was really abrupt Sal  were you listening  that just happened on its own  well yeah it ends  you gotta fade it down  at some point  it sounded cool like that  you like it  yeah  alright I'll take your word for it  you're the production guy  I guess they're of equal value  that's what O.P. says  they're 
[03:18:00]  one is a signed Brad Thor book  a book  so we have  three signed Brad Thor books  one hardcover  I don't even think  we have that many listeners  alright  three signed Brad Thor books  and  O.P. insists  this is of equal value  a signed O.P. Sudoku puzzle  I don't know if anybody  that could be number one  bestseller too  a Sudoku puzzle  you think so  maybe  well the hardcover  is the big prize  I think they're too softcover  alright so we got 
[03:18:30]  Brad Thor books  we got Sudoku puzzles  we got a whole book  what's all the giggling  happening over there  ladies  what  what are you laughing at  Sydney tell me  we're just mimicking  the back of the book  well you're making fun  of Mr. Brad Thor now  you girls  he's so casual  and just  I'm gonna lean against  this one  they're making fun  of poor Brad Thor  he's trying to take a picture  for the back of his book  and he's got like  a leather jacket on  she makes fun of  Brad Thor  and everyone bestseller  but yeah she has  Mulch Man  back on  yeah  Mulch Man  at least he doesn't  try to look all casual  listen 
[03:19:00]  why don't you leave  Brad Thor alone  okay  he's just trying to  write books about  some guy  who's a soldier  he's doing fantastic  no grass stains  on his jeans  either  right  there are no grass  stains on his jeans  see Sal  that counts for my laugh  because  David didn't have  headphones on  I can see  that's okay  I don't  Sam  you have more  through listeners  that one free shit  Jesus Christ  everybody wants a book  Bill in Boston  hi Sam  how are you  good Bill  how are you  I can't tell you  how excited I am 
[03:19:30]  to hear audio  from you  at the gathering  I'm really thrilled  I got Bill  I gotta tell you  I got so much  Juggalo feedback  yesterday  after the show  I'm not  I can't spend  a whole nother  Juggalo  first of all  a whole nother  Juggalo show  going on today  I can't believe  that I forgot  to bring up  the Insane Clown Posse  Jack White collaboration  that blew my mind  when it came out  did you know that Sal  did you know  that they recorded  a single  in Jack White's studio  listen I love Jack White  yeah  but that's  that's a notch down 
[03:20:00]  man  you're not impressed  no what's the  other song  I'll look it up  I think it's like  Lick Mine Arch  or something like that  it's like an ICP Mozart  mashup collaboration  it's very strange  but yeah  I didn't bring that up  but I was getting  text messages  if you remember  we brought up  a wrestler named  Colt Cabana yesterday  who's been to  a ton of  Gathering of the Juggalos  he's the one  who shows up  and incites the crowd  to throw batteries  and shit at him  he says  that Jim will be  treated like a king 
[03:20:30]  at the gathering  I talked to him earlier  and he said  Norton will be  treated like a king  I have no doubt  but then they said  you and Troy  are like  yeah I don't know  yeah I don't know  that I can't  I can't be  confirmed on  you guys might get  the poo poo  well  we'll see  what else is going on  Bill  well I'd like to  get my hands  on one of those  Brad Phil books  and I'm going to  read it over the  summer like he's  recommended  on the beach  well no I work  too much probably  by my pool  but I was wondering  maybe if I can get 
[03:21:00]  a nice Sudoku  bookmark as well  you can't get  two of the prizes  dude  or we just give  a soft cover  to the Sudoku  no I'm just giving  him a soft cover  because he was greedy  you get the soft cover  Bill  thank you very much  guys  okay hold on  no you're tough  I like it  well somebody's  got to be a  disciplinarian around  here  Nick Cannon was  supposed to be  on the show  today  I know  he was supposed  to be stopping  by after  Opie and Anthony  live  he's been on  the show before  if you remember  he stopped by  a while back  and I just sat 
[03:21:30]  there and went  over all the bad  bits he did on  radio with him  and he was a man  he was admitting  that they were all  hokey  he admitted to  having help  from a coach  a talent coach  or whoever it  was they hired  he admitted to  everything that  we made fun of  him for  so I mean I  loved him  we was going to  come back in  today but  apparently he  has to sit  home and listen  to insane clown  posse songs  no I'm kidding  he's got family 
[03:22:00]  matters I think  it's because it's  one of two things  it's either I guess  Mariah Carey dislocated  her shoulder or  something like that  while she was  filming a music  video and Nick  Cannon is the  director of her  music videos now  or was that  her vine video  no the vine  video is the  other thing  she's filming a  music video and  she dislocated her  shoulder she was  filming a video for  her new song with  Miguel who's like the  hottest thing at R&B  right now  he's huge and he  came here recently  he did  yeah  how recently  like a few weeks 
[03:22:30]  ago  he must have been  a swarm of people  he's like the  hottest thing right  now  he's massive  everybody loves  him he's crossing  over big time  but he's got that  beautiful song with  Mariah Carey  and I guess they  were filming a  video for it and  somehow I don't  know what Mariah  Carey is doing in  these videos but  how do you dislocate  a shoulder if you're  Mariah Carey in a  music video  I don't know  how active could you  possibly be  she waves her arms  like she just  don't care  maybe that's what  it was  she threw her  hands in the air  and waved around  like she didn't  care  Mariah you have to  care about your 
[03:23:00]  body you have to  care when you're  doing stuff like  that you'll  dislocate a  shoulder so uh  now Nick Cannon's  not coming in it  was either that or  like last night  on every  entertainment show  they were just  playing and  playing and  playing Mariah  Carey's Instagram  video of her  walking around her  closet in a bikini  holding champagne  like that's all  they just kept  talking about  Mariah Carey I  guess she was  doing like a  fashion show on  Instagram video  yeah for her  4th of July party 
[03:23:30]  and she was just  walking around in  bikinis and stuff  which I was okay  with but then I  realized there's no  way like I kind of  felt bad for Nick  Cannon at that  moment because  there's no way  that I can handle  having a wife that's  that big of a  celebrity like even  now like I get  annoyed when  anybody says  anything even  remotely negative  about my wife  even if they even  if they're they  know me you know  that's why I don't  put a lot of  pictures of her out  there that's why I  just don't want to  open up that  Pandora's box of 
[03:24:00]  criticism I don't  want her being in  the public eye but  if you marry somebody  that's already in the  public eye because  when you're a  celebrity people  feel like they  have free will and  they kind of do I  mean I feel like I  have free will to  say whatever I want  about people who  have chosen to make  their lives public  the same way I  can't complain that  much when people  have opinions about  me if people have  a whole bunch of  people say I suck  and what can I do  I decided to expose  myself to this many  people  I agree with both  things about you  because you're  sometimes you're  tough and you give  unfair demands 
[03:24:30]  I'll talk about that  in a second but  like I can't I would  be so pissed off if  a bunch even I  understand she's  Mariah Carey but  it's think about it  from the perspective  of it's your wife  if a bunch of  entertainment news  shows are just  playing your wife's  Instagram videos of  her dancing around  her closet like a  maniac with a glass  of champagne I'd be  like what are you  doing baby you got  to get off the  computer but that's  how the fuck  Baldwin he takes  you to the streets  right Alec Baldwin  will be like you 
[03:25:00]  like your shit you  fuck with me I'm  fucking with you  he beats them up  yeah he beats  them up yeah  Alec Baldwin's the  only celebrity that  will be like yeah  post whatever you  want about me if I  find you I'm punching  you in the fucking  mouth yeah we do  the photographer right  in the bush he goes  after taking the  picture of my  daughter and he  will do it too  that's the other  thing like he'll  threaten to beat you  up and then if you  don't believe him he'll  go and do it it's  awesome he doesn't  care about assault  charges Alec Baldwin  yeah it's like he  goes yeah you got my  way and I gotta respect  him too because like I 
[03:25:30]  think Alec Baldwin  Alec's career took a  little bit of a dip  everybody's like oh  what's Alec doing  then he got 30 rock  and now he's like this  massive thing he's huge  he's like uh Martin  Sheen everybody still  thinks he's the  president and  everybody thinks Alec  Baldwin's like the  boss right everybody  thinks Alec Baldwin is  running GE yeah but he  hasn't stopped acting  like a maniac yeah he's  still himself he's still  that guy who's cursing at  his at his step at his  daughter or whatever  yeah on the voicemail  except now he's doing it  to paparazzi I love that 
[03:26:00]  he punches people like  yeah I love that he'll  go out him and Sean Penn  and Kanye West are the  only ones that are  willing to go out and  beat up a paparazzo or  they take the camera  smash and they keep on  walking they just keep  walking I don't care yeah  yeah here's a thousand  dollars I'll buy you a  new one I'm famous I got  it but Nick Cannon's like  America's sweetheart he's  got to be the nice guy all  the time so what can he  say I mean goddamn DJ who  kid came on this show and  just said it like it was a  common fact he was like  yeah but I'm pissed on 
[03:26:30]  Mariah Carey we're all  like what what are you  talking about roll it  can you imagine if you're  married to a woman and  there's somebody who's  going out and talking  about people pissing on  her and her Instagram  videos are getting played  on extra while Mario  Lopez is going I don't  know what she's up to  shut up Slater what  business is a real of  yours who are you  judging  Dipples  yeah I would be like  honey again  yeah I'm taking you I'm 
[03:27:00]  taking your phone away I'm  taking your cameras away  your computer privileges are  gone I would just be best  use with Alec and go what  do I do bro and she's  like Nick let me remind you  of something I'm Mariah  Carey  I'm the one in fucking  charge of this shit here  okay all right whatever you  say Mariah all right you  want to do another bikini  video sure like her or not  she's a huge icon that's a  problem she is she's an  icon and so it's like  that's you get from  marrying an icon  hopefully yeah everybody  who graduated high school  our generation had her  song of course as that  on the 4th of July uh the 
[03:27:30]  90s channel here was  doing uh a thing where  they were doing it was  stupid but it was uh best  British artists and best  American artists like I  don't think anybody even  really remembers that  Independence Day is  celebrating our freedom  from Britain nobody yeah  you didn't know that did  you Roland  I thought it was just I  had an extra cronum  right right well  technically are you are  you technically a citizen  yeah okay I was born in  Austin um but but yeah 
[03:28:00]  they were doing the thing  where it was the best  British songs and the best  American songs and Mariah  Carey won she was the  number one American song in  the 90s according to 90s  online uh let me go to  Richard in LA what's up  Richard  oh Sam Roberts the greatest  broadcaster in history come  on how you doing you're not  trying to butter me up are  you no not at all I'm  serious man good good I  wouldn't be listening from  LA this early if I didn't  think so that's exactly  right I'm your morning 
[03:28:30]  drive show hell yeah man  uh two things I wanted to  say whenever you guys come  out to LA I'm the uh  Roland of Los Angeles so  you gotta you gotta get in  touch with me and I'll hook  you up with all the  restaurants oh yeah Roland  what do you think of  that what are your  restaurant connections like  in LA uh they're pretty  good because my dad's a  chef out they killed a chef  in LA so so if we get  Roland and Richard working  together we're kind of  unstoppable here in terms of  food yeah but there'll be a  lot of naps though there  will be some naps yeah  maybe you nap and Richard 
[03:29:00]  takes over yeah like a  taxi right right I gotta  take a nap ski Richard  what else yeah but I just  was wondering if that  Opie Sudoku is still  available it is Richard and  I'm gonna send it to you  okay buddy oh thank you  so much man I appreciate  it all right hold on I  never see anybody get that  excited about Opie's  newspaper clippings he  signs them but it's always  odd to me that they're  such a hit I know I mean  it's it's an admission  maybe it's an admission of  his incredible multitasking  skills I guess so or maybe 
[03:29:30]  it's an admission that when  Ant and Jim talk about  Trayvon Martin and George  Zimmerman he can tune out a  little bit and take a dip  into Lake Opie just start  just start you know filling  out those numbers in those  boxes and get to his own  place get back to that  beach house in his mind  the opesters yeah yeah get  back to opesters on let me  talk to Sean in Alabama  what's up Sean hey Sammy hey  it's my 16th year anniversary

[03:33:30]  through and JWoww starts tweeting out people's  phone numbers and go what's JWoww doing and I  clicked her profile and JWoww's picture has  turned into a swastika I felt bad for her all of a  some hacker I guess got control of JWoww's  Twitter account  I don't want to speculate maybe she signed  up for the Steiner update  you think it might have been Steiner from  Steiner Sports  she like defended him he's like I'm getting  you  he did he did hack into your Twitter didn't 
[03:34:00]  he  he got me good  I was an asshole for like a month  rolling for a month for over a month  yeah three months  was tweeting out every time Steiner from  Steiner Sports he's been on the show  every time he put out a blog post  Roland would tweet it and so one day I  finally went to him like Roland how much  ass are you trying to kiss why are you  tweeting out every time this guy writes a  new blog and Roland goes I don't know he  did something to my Twitter and I can't 
[03:34:30]  fix it  yeah so I guess because when he was here  because I was on Twitter on Twitter oh follow  me and do this yeah and I'm like  savvy so I go here do you do it  I'll do a human translation of that yeah  so so Roland is sitting there he's going  follow me on Twitter and Roland's like  okay let me just and he goes no let me  show you what I do here yeah a couple of  clicks and all of a sudden Roland is  locked into Steiner Sports blog yeah and  I was tweeting like hey uh great meeting  today check out this and my friends are 
[03:35:00]  tweeting me oh hey great meeting today I'm  like wait oh no yeah yeah and you didn't  fix it I can't delete it and plus you were  too embarrassed to tell anybody what had  happened so nobody was there to help you  you just kept tweeting out Steiner  Sports updates and they click on the  wrong one and tweet out like two a day  it's humiliating not though that is bad  though J Wow I guess I don't know who did  it and I don't think they caught anybody  but a swastika ended up as her profile  picture and she posted a Snooki DJ 
[03:35:30]  Pauly D Dina from Jersey Shore and Perez  Hilton cell phone numbers how I think you  need more than a Twitter password to get  that yeah wouldn't you think or unless  if she hooked her Twitter up with  Facebook contacts I think I can't do that  or I would I guess maybe but why if you're  Perez Hilton or Snooki I would hope that  you're smart enough to not have your cell  phone number on your Facebook page have you 
[03:36:00]  seen like they're probably like me they go  oh I'll just do this nobody's ever take it  they're not tech savvy people no it'll be  fine why would anybody be interested in  me yeah I'll never get out poor J Wow I  guess that's why that's what happens  though like we were talking about how  difficult it must be for Nick Cannon to  watch people just drag his wife through  the mud and they're allowed because she's  a celebrity but the worst is when you  become a celebrity for no reason like when  you're on a reality show like a  Kardashian or the Jersey Shore people or 
[03:36:30]  whatever because once you become famous  without having like a discernible talent  then people are just like free reign and  if people know how to hack your Twitter  account and put swastikas up instead of  your photo they'll do it because they're  like no you got famous for doing nothing  so I get to make your life miserable for  my own amusement yeah and there's something  about it that's like yeah okay I see both  sides of the story here I see his point I  feel bad for her but I see his point  hacker probably she's not she's really 
[03:37:00]  not famous famous right as if that  matters yeah so I just do it just for  lols she's got fake tits she must not  have feelings yeah trucker Bob in Kansas  hey I decided you can buy those books  almost several different places but you  can only get that Sudoku puzzle from one  place I guess you already gave it away  too didn't you you already gave it away you  really want one that badly well I would  rather had that than the book but I  take a book yes no so weird no I gave  everything away I'll talk to you later 
[03:37:30]  trucker Bob brother try again next time  but I mean you could actually pick up a  Sudoku puzzle in literally any newspaper  so they're not quite as rare they just  don't have Obie's penmanship all over  them but yeah I it was funny I definitely  laughed when it happened you you've never  had anything hacked oh yeah you have had  other than the Steiner sports thing yeah I  had my NBC email hacked before NBC email 
[03:38:00]  yeah that's the worst feeling I would get  they send the bosses saying um nice ass  you look really sexy today no way yeah do  is it somebody who worked with you that  was trying to make you look bad somebody  who I think got fired at the IT department  was hacking to different sending different  emails out to different people oh wow so I had to  go up to like the head guy going hey it  wasn't me so they fired some nerd and then  he just hacked into everybody's emails and  started making everybody's lives miserable  you see he's a cool I sort of knew him  because he was always hey what's up and 
[03:38:30]  hey I always had problems with my email  yeah that's hard to believe you I know I  know why would they do that though why  wouldn't he if he's if he just got fired  why wouldn't he try to sabotage the boss  why would he go to just working people and  sabotage them what an asshole funny I  thought that's pretty hilarious you thought  it was good you can put yourself you can  put yourself outside of the situation  if I was him I'd probably do the same  thing but you would think that he would  try to hack the boss's email he did a lot  of stuff but mine got mixed in it was 
[03:39:00]  funny what a maniac what a maniac I woke up  with this is why because I wanted to  retweet the jwow tweet when I saw it and  just write uh-oh under it just because I  thought it was funny but then I decided  not to I had an attack of conscience a  crisis of conscience because I woke up one  morning and yeah for work it was like  whatever four o'clock in the morning and  I had emails from all my different email  accounts saying hey congratulations your  password's been changed I went what I've 
[03:39:30]  been asleep how did I change my password and  I had to go in and spend all morning it's  four o'clock in the morning and I had to  sit there at the computer changing every  single password I have on all my email  addresses on my bank stuff on my Facebook  stuff on YouTube on Twitter on everything  and it was just it was such a pain in the  ass your studio 42 is studio 42 no I don't  know why I have to go there why so 
[03:40:00]  somebody who can't say well yeah just say  it I can't sorry where you going I guess  see somebody who are you going to see  I can't say sorry I'm gonna punish you  for this all right judge Alex oh he's  here yeah he came in late so I'm gonna see  if he comes in tomorrow oh Anthony's had a  Twitter relationship with him but yeah  like don't punish me okay you know what's  up what you remember when you rock got his  Twitter hacked you rock your Twitter got  hacked what when remember when you wrote 
[03:40:30]  MSNBC morning show live of the damage of  Oklahoma repeating that more bad weather  could coming could be coming wait wait  what happened let's hope they don't get  out in time what tell me tell me what's  he talking about with this already Eric  what's he talking about Hector was that  you no that was me oh you sick fuck Eric  yeah so I just came in here right here  in a joke from several months ago that's  relevant okay tell me what the joke is  no it was the coverage during the  Oklahoma tornado okay so the Oklahoma 
[03:41:00]  tornado is going on yeah this is the one  that crushed the school yeah okay and  what was the tweet that you saw Sal well  Iraq wrote MSNBC morning show live at  the damage of Oklahoma repeating that  more bad bad weather could be coming let's  hope they don't get out in time what he  wrote that yeah the morning show he  didn't want them to leave he wanted them  to die in the tornado you followed a  natural disaster by praying for more death  for that morning show yes why would you 
[03:41:30]  write that tweet why would you like  because when I was watching it all they  were doing was fear-mongering why would  you want Joe Scarborough to die in a  tornado it wasn't he wasn't there you  wouldn't want that to happen to Joe  Scarborough no he's a decent fella so you  would want that town to get hit with more  tornadoes just so Mishka doesn't make it  out alive that was the hope at the point  that's horrible number one you're hoping  for Mishka's death and even though we've  had our problems with her I don't say it's  appropriate to wish for her death and  number two the town has already been 
[03:42:00]  ravaged by weather do you really think  it's don't you think it's a little  selfish just because you have such  resentments about Mishka that you hope  that the town gets even more tornadoes  like it well yes it will take out Mishka  but aren't you worried that it will take  out more children at that point everything  was already devastated you're cold Eric  you're cold-blooded man I'm sorry but  that morning show was pissing me off that  day and you wanted them to all be dead  they said more bad weather's coming like 
[03:42:30]  they're trying to make people more  upset after you know something horrific  just happened was there more bad weather  coming I don't think anything else  happened after that point do we know for  a fact we don't you just want them to  be dead that morning show at that time  yes oh oh Eric do you think that was  appropriate no no I I'm not apologizing  for how I felt but then when Sal was  pointing that out I was like oh yeah  that could have been misread so I was  like yeah I'd best take that down oh  you deleted the tweet yeah yeah I got a 
[03:43:00]  screenshot of it though oh Jesus Christ  when did he tweet it what was it 734 a.m.  and my Twitter thing says one minute ago  well what did what day was it though I  don't know what day it was it was you  know it was the day after that happened  what around when how long ago was that  should have a date there Sal I don't  all right so Google it or something  how long ago was this tornado it was  it's not even tornado season anymore  no why'd you write MA tornado it wasn't 
[03:43:30]  in Massachusetts are you nuts okay  tornado uh early June early June it was  a month and a half ago that seems longer  than that you've been sitting on this for  a month and a half you are psycho I am  or him Sal I mean he's just been sitting  on this tweet for a month and a half no I  tweeted out that day and you were just  like oh Sam kind of brought up something  to do with the internet I can squeeze this in  no I thought Eric was talking about getting 
[03:44:00]  his Twitter hacked I thought someone I never  said a word didn't interject yourself into a  situation did Sal think that your Twitter  got hacked or did you tell him yes I  tweeted that I told him he came in  thinking this was such a huge ordeal and  and I was like what the fuck is wrong with  you so you just came in to humiliate poor  Eric I was asking if he is you attack that  no but you knew it didn't he told you  already that it didn't yeah I was just  trying to confirm it again make a bit out  of nothing I don't try to make bits I 
[03:44:30]  think he was going out of his way to try  to make you look bad on the air did it  work no I kind of worked I mean that's a  horrible thing to tweet out no you don't  think it is no I was fine with it then  why'd you delete it because the way it was  written could have been missed it taken  the wrong way so it's a bad thing to  tweet let's hope they don't get out in  time and how long ago was that after  the hurricane hit hours yeah hours that's  that terrible thing to tweet out well  they're terrible morning show oh come  on they're not that bad though not that 
[03:45:00]  bad that you'd want them to die like  when Russell Brand came on and kind of  humiliated them and made fun of them it's  the morning Joe show on MSNBC and you  remember the video Russell Brand came on  and he kind of made fun of them and he  humiliated Mishka and he made it seem  like their jobs were easy that I feel  like is appropriate to say that I hate  this morning show so much that I hope the  weather ravaged town they're in continues  to get hit with an onslaught of natural 
[03:45:30]  disasters simply so those morning show  hosts will die is a horrible horrible  sentiments oh boohoo you don't think  that's bad even when I phrase it like  that you don't think that's a bad thing  no I'm pretty ridiculous I think it's  pretty hard you know we were just  talking about how you feel like when  people are public figures you can say  whatever you want about them and how  Mariah Carey you can say whatever you  want about her Nick Cannon's gonna be  pissed off but at the same time he's got  to realize like Roland said Mariah Carey's 
[03:46:00]  an icon if I want to call her nuts I can  call her nuts I don't think you should  be able to say I hope those news anchors  do not make it out of that report I hope  they die no he could say it there's not  wrong he has the freedom to say it but  yeah up right okay all right you're  right about that so he is allowed to say  because free speech is important above  all else true but we can in turn make  judgments about him as a human being  that's fucked up based on his speech  correct absolutely I can sit there and 
[03:46:30]  say quite frankly I don't think Eric's a  good person no Eric's Eric's probably  one of the nicest people I know but  that what are you talking about he's  one of the nicest people you know I've  never heard of one nice person  tweeting that I hope the morning Joe  show gets trapped in a hurricane also  I'm okay with the fact that a hurricane  would be coming to a place that already  got hit by a hurricane tornado whatever  it is tornadoes Roland says whatever it is  Toronto the Toronto's don't you think  that's inappropriate no all right well 
[03:47:00]  I'm gonna go to somebody in Oklahoma  okay and we're gonna find out now this  has nothing to do with the Twitter  hacking thing that I brought up a  minute ago nothing like sound just came  in here to try to make you look bad  correct yeah okay I was just asking if  we got Rick yes what's up buddy for  once I got to support you rock on this  man live in Oklahoma okay 20 minutes  where the tornado hit and we would take  another tornado so you found out that the 
[03:47:30]  morning Joe show was in that town you'd be  okay with some more tornadoes even if it  blew apart your house as long as it took  out the morning Joe show exactly all right  we're tough here in Oklahoma we can take it  you can rebuild your city as long as the  morning Joe show ceases to exist correct  okay thank you thank you for clarifying Rick  let me go to John in Georgia I'm sure  John will agree I got it I got a  disagree with you here yeah just because 
[03:48:00]  he doesn't want him to get out of the  town doesn't mean he wants to die you  might want him to just you know experience  a little tragedy themselves if they're  reporting on it they ought to experience a  little bit okay you rock did you want  them to experience some of the tragedy or  were you hoping they would die I want  them devastated at that point be honest  devastated meaning dead if that's what  happened at that point did you want them  dead at that point I'm really bad to  happen to them like for instance  something fatal that they didn't make  it out in time for the next storm  meaning they weren't alive anymore 
[03:48:30]  whatever happened oh god all right let  me go to Ryan let me go to Ryan in uh in  Vegas what's up Ryan  best tweet ever by  are you having second thought maybe you  can retweet yourself now maybe you can  repost it hey remember a couple months  ago when there was a tornado this is  what I thought I remember I was on the  train and I got a little bit of signal I  refreshed my Twitter feed and that came  up my jaw hit the ground I thought it  was the funniest most ridiculous thing 
[03:49:00]  Eric has ever said well you know Eric I've  been described as being a little too  sensitive in the past so that's probably  me no you're not sensitive at all I get  it I get a little more emotional than most  no you don't you're dead inside but  who's that giggling in there uh Jackie I  hope she doesn't make it out of that  room alive but but maybe based on the  fan response you shouldn't take Sal's  criticism so uh so literally I mean Sal 
[03:49:30]  said that that was a horrible thing to  tweet out but all these people are on  your side well I didn't step back from  that I didn't say that or you deleted it  you delete that point because I thought  it may be the point I was trying to get  across may have been taken the wrong way  but that was because of what Sal said  you're like oh I didn't think of it from  that perspective on the other but on the  other end of the spectrum you get all  these people calling up there saying that  is literally the best tweet that anyone's  ever tweeted because I saved it you know  shit went down and there were still kids  trapped in that school and these people 
[03:50:00]  are sitting there well you know more  storms might be coming you wanted  another hurricane another tornado I  should say you wanted another tornado to  hit that town while kids were still  stuck at the school again that point  wasn't thought out it was that I just  wanted that morning show gone so if the  morning show is reporting in front of the  school no they weren't at the school  what you want is for the school with  children stuck in it now see now you're  to be here with another tornadoes is that 
[03:50:30]  right no Eric was it a typo no I wrote it  well it obviously wasn't a typo it wasn't  like there was one word that was wrong  there it was just a full statement of  evil yes Ron Ron in Wyoming you're on the  after show how's it going not too bad hey  you know I just went to the liquor store  man there was one of them jugs versus a  fund for Oklahoma tornadoes I said can I 
[03:51:00]  put one of them up there too from some  change for me I just I don't know that's a  good idea ain't it no it's a terrible  idea terrible phone call terrible terrible  terrible although you would probably think  that's a great idea now hey all these  people get devastated by a tornado getting  so much money how about sub for me you  ever tweet anything out like that no never  are you pissed that Sal decided to go out  of his way to try to make you look bad I  wasn't you're not it was funny why not  because he's desperate for attention he 
[03:51:30]  wants to be like oh so it's like you  more like at this point you feel bad for  him it is what it is he's gonna keep  trying and maybe one of these days it'll  strike gold for him but I gotta say once  again we go to the phone calls me  personally I think he rocks tweet was out  of line but that's because it pulls at my  elongated heartstrings it's not difficult  to get me all choked up everybody knows  that no you're not but Sal we went to the  phones and they were kind of on you rock  side this time I got to say this is a 
[03:52:00]  win for Iraq absolutely don't don't try to  Sam Roberts routine with me what are you  talking about this is this is what are you  talking about this is a win this you see  what he's doing right he's trying to be  anybody on this show that's that'll like  him right right right right he's like oh  Sam gets it seems like he gets a lot of  heat maybe if I kind of talk like him I can  I can get by and I'm learning from the  best as well true I appreciate every  time well it's a slow learner I thought  that was the funniest fucking tweet I've  ever seen ever okay fine but you brought 
[03:52:30]  that up a month and a half ago because  you wanted to make him hoping it would  make him look a little bad at some point  it doesn't make him look good it makes  him look evil silly really right things  have not been said on this show by people  on this show or social media any of that  stuff and I'm an asshole for this look we  all know who's Twitter account you're  talking about and that's up to personal  opinion isn't it but I wasn't specifying  but nobody's ever tweeted I hope that 
[03:53:00]  school gets hit by another tornado because  I want Mishka to die I never said that  but it was that's a paraphrase now you're  putting in the wrong word all right well  maybe I'm out of line oh we're out of  time wow and I don't want that to how  convenient no seriously or no really it is  convenient I got nothing else to go on gotcha  all right listen tell Jackie to keep her  mouth shut shut up she's laughing at you  yeah I don't want to point at you yeah  good good we'll see I'll make her pay  stay tuned Ron and Fez are coming up  next goodbye  the Opie and Anthony show is now over for
