<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed a raucous, vomit-filled eggnog drinking contest, the centerpiece of the show.  This third annual event, filmed by HDNet and livestreamed on Paltalk (with highlights later on YouTube and opiananthony.com), featured ten contestants, including May, the first female participant, and recurring contenders like Pat from Minaki and Flea.  The contest involved consuming double shots of eggnog every minute until vomiting, resulting in graphic descriptions of the contestants' expulsions, including sounds, amounts, and methods.  Sergeant Magoo’s unique contribution—vomiting into a pitcher, mixing it with Froot Loops, and consuming the concoction—sickened other participants. The Connecticut School of Broadcasting intern also participated, attempting to impress the hosts.  Money was bet on the outcome, although the hosts did not endorse this.  The contest narrowed down to three finalists, with significant commentary on the volume and style of vomiting.  Joe Rogan called in and was later a guest in the studio, expressing astonishment at the event, particularly intern Pat Duffy's "Viking swig" of Sergeant Magoo's puke-and-Froot Loops concoction.  This led to E-Rock vomiting repeatedly.  Listener Drew, wearing a Nirvana shirt, also partook in the puke-related festivities, gargling some of Magoo's mixture.  The hosts proposed even more extreme challenges (drinking urine), which were rejected.

Pat from Minaki ultimately won, consuming 75 double shots.  However, the ultimate highlight was Pat, needing to relieve himself due to diabetes, vomiting into intern Pat Duffy's open mouth, a stunt dubbed "The Baby Bird" by Joe Rogan, causing widespread shock and laughter.  The event's video was slated for Joe Rogan's website and YouTube.  Pat's father called in, offering his son an internship.  His girlfriend, Tanya, also appeared, revealing she met Pat through the O&A Paltalk community, moved from Missouri to be closer to him, and currently resides with a womanizing male friend, Master Poe, from F.H. Riley's.  Their relationship was discussed, highlighting Pat's deep infatuation and Tanya's less intense feelings, along with her occasional disappearances, including one at a past O&A Halloween show.  Sexually suggestive comments and jokes about masturbation fantasies punctuated the conversation.  Photographs of Tanya, taken without her knowledge, were shown, causing discomfort, especially for Poe.  

The show also featured other segments:  discussions about upcoming appearances by Bill Burr, Joe Rogan (both in studio and calling in), and Bob Saget; the hosts’ new TV commercial (with Jim Norton’s awkward acting); and their upcoming West Palm Beach broadcast and bake sale, alongside complaints about their liaison, Kenny, and catering issues.  E-Rock, a show producer, was also briefly mentioned. Jim Norton was a guest throughout much of the broadcast. Jamie Mossad from the Laugh Factory was also a studio guest, joining in the discussion about the Michael Richards racial slur incident at the Laugh Factory, the subsequent actions taken by Masada (refunding tickets, banning Richards), and the fear of potential riots.  The conversation broadened to racial slurs in comedy and challenges faced by club owners.  A heated debate ensued about Dane Cook stealing comedic material, with multiple examples and audio clips played, including comparisons with Louis C.K.'s material.  Masada defended Cook, citing jealousy among comedians.  The discussion also involved Carlos Mencia and George Lopez, with Masada recounting a physical altercation between the two.  The word "nigger" was repeatedly mentioned and debated.  The broadcast concluded with announcements about upcoming show locations and guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Danny, one goes in, millions come out. Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next vector, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with pure rage. 
[00:00:30]  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a war fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Opie.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing. 
[00:01:00]  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And what a busy, busy show it's going to be.  People setting up stuff and everything.  Plastic is being set up all over the studio.  That can only mean one thing.  That can only mean one thing, my friend.  That's right. 
[00:02:00]  It is the annual, the third annual, I believe.  Third annual eggnog drinking contest.  This is how we welcome in the Christmas season every single year.  How else are you supposed to welcome in the Christmas time of year than a nice eggnog drinking contest? 
[00:02:30]  All of our pals show up every year.  Some of the same faces.  Some new ones.  Some new competitors.  And bottom line is, how much eggnog can you drink?  Before it all comes rumbling back.  With that wonderful sound like an Evinrude engine being tested in a 55-gallon drum.  Love it.  And the contest is very, very, very simple for you at home. 
[00:03:00]  These guys will drink a double shot of eggnog every single minute until we've got one standing.  You puke, you're out.  You puke, you're out.  The current record holder is Pat from Munaki.  He set the record last year, even though he lost the competition.  Set the record, lost the competition.  Interesting finish we had last year.  Well, because you've got a whole minute to drink your double shot of eggnog.  So there's a little strategy involved. 
[00:03:30]  So what happened was, yeah, Pat drank his 70-second double shot of eggnog and puked.  And Badlands Booker, he still had time to get a 70-second shot down, and he did.  He didn't have to.  Oh, that's right.  At that point, he didn't have to.  You're right.  First one to woof.  That's it.  Absolutely.  Yeah, okay, you're right.  And then he puked after Pat from Munaki.  Right after.  Like they were both holding it in, and they were trying their best not to puke.  Pat was the first.  Yeah, you're right.  Pat was the first to do the 70-second double shot of eggnog. 
[00:04:00]  Puked right after that.  But Badlands Booker had time left in his minute, and he didn't have to drink it at that point.  And then he proceeded to puke right after Pat.  He woofed.  It was an amazing finish.  Let's just put it that way.  Photo finish.  Amazing.  We wind up meeting a lot of people that stay kind of friends at the show, too.  Yeah.  It's like, this is what we say around the Opie and Anthony show.  There are no strangers in the eggnog contest, only friends we haven't met yet.  Remember we said that?  Not at all. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, what's his name here who's going to, like, do a little puke and then eat some Froot Loops for us?  Oh, Sarge.  Sarge?  Sergeant Magoo?  Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo.  Yeah, well, on the Pal Talk camera the other day, we watched him eat butter sticks and cream and milk and ketchup and then woof it all into a Tupperware bowl.  He then poured in Froot Loops into what he had vomited and ate it.  It was so awful to watch, even on Pal Talk. 
[00:05:00]  I couldn't imagine watching that live.  Yeah.  But he said he's going to do it.  I don't know if I want to watch that.  And speaking of Pal Talk, the eggnog drinking contest, of course, we'll be on Pal Talk for all to see.  Yeah.  For all to see.  Join in.  And then we're going to be making videos and we'll throw those up on YouTube and opiananthony.com.  You get the deal.  By the way, this isn't the greatest puking show that we do. 
[00:05:30]  What?  Nothing will ever beat the puking that happened in Boston back in the day at WBCN.  The clam chowder?  Yeah, the clam chowder thing.  That was a goodie.  That was a great contest.  Same concept.  You eat as much clam chowder as possible.  And if you puke you out, you're out.  If you won, you were going to the Super Bowl, I guess.  Yeah.  And then we got a winner and then we so happened to have another pair of Super Bowl tickets.  So we got four or five guys that were out of the competition to try again. 
[00:06:00]  And basically what they had to do, man, I hope you're not eating breakfast.  They had to take a spoon.  A nice heaping spoonful.  A tablespoonful of the puke that was in the barrel.  That's right.  Except everyone was using the same barrel.  And the contest was simple.  All they had to do was hold down the tablespoon of puke for one minute, I think. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I think it was just a minute.  And they're going to the Super Bowl as well.  There were guys gagging before they even brought the spoon up to their mouth.  They took a spoon.  Remember, there were a couple of guys that took a spoonful, looked at it, and just started going,  Oh, it was just amazing.  And contestant after contestant could not keep this lousy tablespoon of puke down.  So they continued puking some more. 
[00:07:00]  And then the contestants that were waiting to try to win the tickets for the Super Bowl,  they started puking even though they weren't even doing it yet.  Just watching.  It just became a complete and utter mess that day in Boston.  It was a vomitorium.  It was amazing.  It was truly amazing.  So we'll see what happens today with the eggnog drinking contest.  We're going to start right around 7 o'clock, so we're getting close.  Less than an hour away.  We're signing in the contestants, and we'll get to know the contestants,  and we'll start drinking some eggnog in less than an hour here. 
[00:07:30]  I want a shot of eggnog.  No, you don't.  Traditionally, I do one a year.  Eggnog is awful.  It really is awful.  The name itself is horrible.  What is a nog?  What is it to do to an egg that makes it nogged?  I don't know.  And is there egg in it?  Who the hell knows?  And what the hell is nog?  Who the hell knows?  I don't like it.  I just know it's viscous and creamy and thick.  It's cinnamony.  It has a nice flavor to it. 
[00:08:00]  Does it?  It's got a nice holiday flavor to it.  It does it?  Yeah.  I got to tell you, we've been very, very busy.  Yesterday, we spent the whole afternoon into the night filming a TV commercial.  I think it's going to turn out pretty good.  Should be on TV within a week, I guess.  A little over a week.  I think they'll have a rough cut in a week, and then shortly after that, it'll start hitting the air.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with it.  We don't want to give too much away.  No.  But we certainly had a lot of fun.  Jimmy's involved.  Jimmy's involved in the commercial. 
[00:08:30]  Finally, there's an acknowledgment that Jim Norton is a part of this program.  Oh, guys.  I don't know.  And his part in it, classic.  Oh, yeah.  Just some good acting.  I'm going to do an actor.  I can't help it.  I was motivated.  I certainly were.  I wanted to keep leaning in and just, come on, guys.  Could you give me more?  Could you give me more?  Yeah.  Could you?  I'm not really feeling it.  I know.  To work with Jimmy Norton.  You know, this is a guy that was in a blockbuster action film, Spider-Man. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  He was in Spider-Man.  We felt privileged.  I have now worked with a man that was in a blockbuster movie.  Well, you know, I understand it's very intimidating to be on the set.  It was.  I was nervous.  What will he do as an actor?  I think the outtakes are going to be a huge hit with the listeners.  Oh, yeah.  I guess we can't give much away as far as the commercial goes.  Just let it sit for now?  Okay.  Just let it sit.  But a bunch of questions coming in.  What did Jimmy do with his hands?  Oh, he was holding onto a doorknob as tight as he could. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And the other hand was on a wall.  For the people that are familiar with this program and the questions that we ask every  actor that comes in here, what do you do with your hands when you're acting?  It's very awkward.  They can't just dangle at your sides.  You can't just use them for something silly.  You've got to be natural.  You've got to look natural.  And it's always been an issue with Jimmy.  And, well, he just finds a way in this commercial to not have to worry about what he's doing 
[00:10:00]  with his hands.  I held my left one like Quincy, which was having all your fingers clenched.  And kind of out in front of you.  Out in front of you.  Like you're pontificating.  Yes.  And in my right arm, I kind of feel like the worm when you're breakdancing.  No one will notice.  It looks very natural.  Well, look for the TV commercial on...  Sam.  ...on the old TV set within, like, a week or so.  Sam.  I've got to get that one.  We've got to catch him, Sam.  That's perfect, Quincy.  And the other thing, right after the show today, we fly to West Palm Beach. 
[00:10:30]  Ah.  We're going to be at the bake sale tomorrow.  We can't wait.  And then we're doing our show Monday and Tuesday from the West Palm Beach station there.  And it was already starting in the office with the weather forecast.  Well, Jimmy blew off Chicago to go to West Palm Beach.  Yeah.  And Chicago is just a mess today.  Oh, is Chicago there?  Ah.  Kenny had to bring it up, too.  You know, we were going to go to Chicago.  You see the snow?  We was booked to fly there.  Well, the main reason I canceled Chicago was because I did not trust a flight out of Chicago on Sunday to get me to West Palm on Monday. 
[00:11:00]  I could have done Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and flown and connected through Newark.  I didn't trust it.  They call that, what are you, you're being socked in.  You might have gotten socked in.  Is it really bad?  Are they stopping flights today?  Well, it's not pretty in Chicago.  Maybe someone from Chicago could give us a call, give us the latest update.  Here's what else Kenny is commenting on.  We watched the weather, and apparently there's going to be a high wind advisory starting at 1 p.m. 
[00:11:30]  Now, we were supposed to take a 1.15, 1.30 flight out of Newark, but he said,  Oh, but, you know, some people that make travel arrangements don't know.  You know, you make a reservation, it doesn't mean they're going to hold the ticket.  You've got to book that, and they lost it, and now we've got to take a 3, what time is it?  A 3.40 flight, and I don't know, I hope we can get out of here, because this high wind 
[00:12:00]  and a storm's coming in.  He just annoys everybody.  Just gloom and dread.  I was reading my email this morning, and I guess there's been some communiques going back  and forth between, you know, Club Soda Kenny and the West Palm Beach people.  Yeah, Kenny is our liaison.  Just making sure we're all set up, you know, like stupid things like make sure we have food  in the morning before we do our radio show.  Yeah, we need food for when we come in, because there's no time before the show to go out. 
[00:12:30]  What are we going out to a restaurant at 3 in the morning?  Right.  And dining?  So shortly before the show starts, the show starts at 6 Eastern, you know,  so it means food's got to be there before 6.  Right.  Or else we're eating on the air and being yelled at.  Well, there's a lot of controversy going back and forth.  And finally, the general manager down there, I don't want to, like, you know,  blow up his spot, say his name on the radio, he writes to Kenny, and he goes,  I run a radio station, not a restaurant.  I think it started, look, comma. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  I run a radio station, not a restaurant.  And you know what?  I feel for this guy today.  Absolutely.  Yeah, see?  You know our pain.  Absolutely.  Where is it?  I'm trying to find it real fast.  Enter the world of dealing with Club Soda Kenny.  That's somewhere in here.  Kenny, take a bullet for us.  But other people don't want to hear it.  We love the guy. 
[00:13:30]  Does everything we need.  But for the people that are in his way or have to provide, he actually, for the bake sale on Saturday,  the big show, the big concert that we're going to, he wrote some of the things.  You know, we have certain riders in our contract, things we need backstage, food, some water.  I, by the way, need three bottles of Shiraz. 
[00:14:00]  Three?  Three bottles.  What's that, dude?  Of wine.  I really don't need three.  But, you know, I guess it gives me a choice and it gives a chance.  Is Danny going?  All right, good.  Get eight.  I just need a beer, a beer and a piece of chicken.  And then there's...  I'm easy.  There's ingredients for chocotinis, chocolate martinis.  And then he not only added the ingredients, but added how to make it. 
[00:14:30]  Like, no one knows, no one needs to know how to make it.  You know, whoever wants to make them knows how to make it so they make them themselves.  We just need the ingredients there.  So people are like, what are we, bartending?  So I'm under the impression now that everybody down there in West Palm is like, oh, here come the prima donna.  Absolutely.  Here they come.  Shiraz.  Now, meanwhile, we didn't say a word.  It was, you know, Kenny taking care of us and, you know, in his inimitable style. 
[00:15:00]  Here's Club Soda Kenny, everybody.  Kenny.  I'm sorry I can't be too intentive to you, gentlemen, but I'm dealing with the, like, everything for the eggnog.  Intentive?  Intentive?  Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know.  You're going to go in a tent?  No, like to take care of you.  Intentive?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, with intent.  Yeah.  Good intentions.  Oh, as opposed to attentive.  Right.  Absolutely.  Giving your attention to us.  You know I'm big and stupid.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go. 
[00:15:30]  No, no.  What do you got?  Take care of business.  No, I just wanted to come and say thank you for the kind words.  All right.  There he goes.  Well, I found the email.  So it was going back and forth about a chef.  You know, Kenny wants a chef there by five.  The radio station's saying, look, I don't think they're going to be able to get there  by five, but hopefully by six.  Kenny's saying it's not good enough.  They have to eat before the show.  So it goes back and forth.  And then the guy who's running the radio station down there, he's got bigger problems than our  stupid breakfast.  Yeah.  He writes Ken.  He goes, Ken, sorry, man, but we can only do what we can do. 
[00:16:00]  And we busted our balls to get everything that they need done and done right.  If the chef can make it, he'll be here.  If you have another idea, go for it.  I run a radio station, not a restaurant.  I'll do what I can.  Wow.  And then, of course, Kenny has to just write, I guess I'll try to find another chef.  Thanks for trying.  Thanks for trying.  Sorry.  You P.O.'d him so bad.  And then it was like, I'll find another chef.  Sorry.  Don't you worry yourself.  If I got to get up and cook myself, I will. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, we know, Kenny.  We know.  Put the apron on.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Picking dried hair out of an egg.  Part killer, part Linda Lavin.  Used to be sad.  Adam and Eve on a raft.  Wreck them.  So here's the deal.  That's old 50s style diner talk.  Here's the deal.  Let's get it out of the way.  So we filmed the TV commercial yesterday.  A little tired.  A little tired.  Flying out today after the show to West Palm Beach. 
[00:17:00]  We'll be doing our show live in West Palm Beach Monday and Tuesday.  We'll be at their bake sale, which is a great, great concert thingy tomorrow.  Absolutely.  And today on the Opie and Anthony show, we got Bill Burr coming in.  We got Joe Rogan coming back.  We got Bob Saget calling in.  And we got the eggnog drinking contest.  Action packed.  And they'll start drinking their eggnog around 7 o'clock this morning.  So about 45 minutes from right now.  All right?  I think a bake sale also is supposed to be sunny in the 80s. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I know.  How great is that?  Chicago's hearing this.  Hey, sorry, Chicago.  You live there.  You chose to live there.  Actually, Buffalo is hearing this as well.  Buffalo, please.  Don't even get me started.  Michigan is hearing this, Anthony.  Hey.  What about Maine?  They're hearing this.  They enjoy the snowy weather.  They hate 80 degrees.  They hate it.  Maine does?  Yeah.  They love the snow.  Right?  Why would you live there?  Good point.  Good point.  Thank you.  Maybe because your family's still there. 
[00:18:00]  Please.  Get a pillow out.  Suffocate him.  Move to a warmer climate.  All right.  We got lots and lots to do today.  Where's our boy?  Where is E-Rock?  Where is the E to the rock?  Oh, look at him run.  E-Rock.  You excited about going home to West Palm Beach this weekend?  Sure.  Why not?  Where were you just at Kids R Us getting that shirt?  What's a fine shirt if you're growing up?  It's a short-sleeved green shirt with a little yellow trimmin around the neck and sleeve areas. 
[00:18:30]  What's wrong with having some yellow trimmins around your shirt?  It looks like it should have Chico's Bail Bonds on the back.  Yeah, you got those colors working today, E-Rock.  Leave Little League's shirt alone.  Is mommy going to be cooking for you?  No, they're coming out for dinner on Sunday.  Aw.  Aw.  With who?  Just my parents and I think the rest of my family in West Palm.  Okay, very cool.  Of course, we're all going to do an E-Rock's family.  Yeah.  That's what I was getting at.  No, we better not. 
[00:19:00]  Where's the invite?  You know E-Rock doesn't want us there because he wants to sit there and just talk about how he runs  the show.  Like, E-Rock will be, he'll hold court.  He's going to get the seat, the head of the table and just, yeah, well, you know, producing  that show is not as easy as it seems, let me tell you.  He doesn't want us sitting there going, wait a minute, all you do is push buttons.  I'm past the cranberry sauce.  My boy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's my boy.  You know, he runs that.  That show couldn't run without him.  More mayo, son. 
[00:19:30]  It's just a bowl of mayo with M&Ms made into a smiley face to welcome Honey Bunny home.  Here's your favorite dessert.  Oh, mom.  It's mayo with M&Ms in it and a splash of incompetence.  All right.  We're getting ready for the eggnog drinking contest.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the annual eggnog challenge. 
[00:20:00]  Of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  The cups are out.  The eggnog is being brought into the studio.  If you're just tuning in, eggnog drinking contest number three goes down today. 
[00:20:30]  That's a lot of eggnog.  Real simple contest.  I think we got about, I don't know, we got 16 people that want in on the contest.  How many do we want to take?  Like 10 or so?  Yeah, I'm thinking 10.  That's why there is a lot of tarp down.  Wow.  Are you afraid these guys are going to explode?  Well, there was a whole discussion about, you know, if the rug gets ruined, it's going to cost $8,000.  And we don't want to pay the cleaning crew too much money, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:21:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  So we got tarps just taped all over the place.  Usually the puke, you know, ends up in the buckets.  In the bucket.  Guys are pretty good with that.  We've never had a projectile vomit away from the bucket.  And it's a very easy contest.  One double shot of eggnog every single minute until you puke.  Last man standing wins the title.  Happy holidays.  By the way, last year's winner not in the contest this year.  He has retired.  Oh, we thought maybe there'd be a surprise.  He would come in and bum out Pat from Munaki, who lost to him such a close finish last year. 
[00:21:30]  But he's not going to be here.  Badlands Booker.  No.  Pat from Munaki won the first annual.  He lost last year, but came in second, but set the record.  Yeah.  So he's just a monster in the eggnog drinking contest.  Opie, if you remember last year, Badlands and Pat neck and neck the entire way.  And blowing away the competition.  Like they were the only two that were really contestants, competitors at this point. 
[00:22:00]  Everybody else rookies, just puking out.  Yeah, we knocked out a lot of guys really early and it came down to these two guys.  So Pat absolutely has to be the favorite now.  Pat, you got hair coming in.  Yeah, what's going on?  Let my hair grow a little bit.  Is that your natural hair color?  Are you a blonde?  Yeah, a gray.  I'm an alien.  A gray.  Who knew that he was a blonde?  Ew, you are?  Yeah, dirty blonde. 
[00:22:30]  Am I cold?  What happened?  Are you sickly?  Yeah.  A little weight, a couple of T-cells.  I wonder who told him to grow the hair back.  What girlfriend might have told him?  No girlfriend.  Oh, was that it?  No.  What?  Did a girl tell you to grow your hair back in?  No.  I like running my fingers through a man's hair.  It's so soft.  No, that's not a direct quote.  Oh, no.  Do you have a girlfriend now?  No.  What was the big news? 
[00:23:00]  You had big news for us today.  I was going to do it just before my first shot.  But, uh, I'm in love.  Ew.  Pat, we've known you for many years now.  Yes.  And, um, well, at least a couple.  Seems like many.  Feels like many.  Yeah, it certainly does.  When those jokes start.  But we've never known you to be in love.  I've never known me to be in love. 
[00:23:30]  Now, is it, uh, do you have, uh, reciprocation in this love?  Well, uh, I've said, I love you to this person.  And this person said, I love you back.  Although, I know.  But not with the same intonation as I say.  Like, I love you.  Like, you say to my mom.  Oh, no.  You poured your heart out and she went, love you too.  Yeah.  With the YA.  How long have you guys been dating?  We haven't been dating.  We've been spending, I call it spending time together.  How much does it cost in you? 
[00:24:00]  About, hey, no.  Oh.  About, uh, two weeks.  Two, three weeks.  Oh, wait a minute.  Two weeks.  Wow.  You said, I love you after two weeks, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, you got it bad.  That's healthy, though.  That's not obsessive.  You got it bad.  You got it bad.  How, uh, how long?  I've been infatuated before, but I've never been in love.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Now, wait a minute.  I gotta ask you this.  You've been together two weeks?  Uh, yes.  Two weeks.  So, you didn't say, I love you, day one.  Yeah.  So, how long into it?  Uh, I'd say you got it.  And you didn't say, what, today? 
[00:24:30]  So, it had to be, what, a week?  I'd say a good, uh, week and a half.  Two weeks.  But it's been two weeks.  So, you just told her?  Well, when you know it, you know it.  I got shot in the heart.  Could have been a palpitation.  So, you, um, you, you said, what were the circumstances?  I gotta know the place, the setting.  Were you dropping her off and you said it, and then she just yelled back over the shoulder,  me too!  As she was going to the house.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  No, they.  Uh, no, just, it's a slow over, well, slow over two weeks. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, over two weeks.  Just.  A whirlwind romance.  Just how sweet this person is.  Yeah.  And wonderful they are.  I just said, there you go, that's it.  But, but where were you?  Where was I?  In the van.  Oh, she was driving around with me, making deliveries.  Driving around, making deliveries.  So, you just, you felt it so much inside of you that you just, what, turned?  Were you stopped at a light?  Uh, no, actually I was at a delivery and she was throwing, throwing boxes at me.  She was throwing boxes at you.  It was after I said I love you, she was throwing boxes at me. 
[00:25:30]  Helping you out.  Couldn't you pick a more romantic situation to say I love you?  That's when it struck.  Then her helping you, could you help me put this, uh, couch in my van?  And we had.  What were you, what were you delivering?  I was at 14.  What were you delivering at the time?  Uh, boxes of, uh, of, uh, bottles of, uh, perfume.  They're not, they're empty bottles.  They deliver for a glass man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  So you're delivering and then it just, why that moment?  You were looking at her? 
[00:26:00]  Well, other, well, I delivered to this place and the elevator guy's talking to her.  The guy's, I've delivered there for five years and he's never talked to me.  Oh, son of a bitch.  He's trying to C-block you.  Bobby, the elevator, freight elevator guy.  Screw him.  I hope he falls down that elevator shaft.  Or tries to stop it with his arm and it closes anyway and rips his arm over the shoulder.  Yeah.  Then we'll see him flirt.  Would you join the army?  Or the armless?  Oof.  Oh.  I'm working that one out.  Oh, we're good.  That was classic because it was a Pat from Monoculine, but yet you really secretly hoped 
[00:26:30]  it had something.  Yeah.  Sorry, you're delivering boxes and you say, you just blurted it out.  Yeah, how did you?  Well, it was when we just got there and we had our song playing.  Oh, what's your song?  You already have a song after two weeks?  Yes.  All Right Now by Free.  It's like, because it was, it's All Right Now.  All Right Now by Free.  Now I listen to the words in songs.  We're listening to, uh, to, uh, How Sweet It Is To Be In Love By You. 
[00:27:00]  How sweet it is to be in love.  Are you?  Oh, no.  Yeah, it's really disgusting.  So what else did you do in 1977?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  It's not a new song, Pat.  Uh, yeah.  Did you get some afternoon delight?  I said I love you.  We're listening to Strange Fruit.  I just whispered it to her.  Well, it's not tainted love.  So, uh, you, you chose that point to, uh, you looked over. 
[00:27:30]  It was just like a, I, I felt it and then I said it.  Did, was it a production?  Was it kind of like, did you touch her?  Did you say, I got, I got to tell you something?  I put my hand on her shoulder.  Uh-huh.  And then when she said, back, back off, I almost said a dirty word.  I forgot where I was.  Uh, and I said, I love you.  And then my head was sort of to the side.  So this, so you tilted your head, you touched her shoulder and said, I love, I love you.  And then what did she say? 
[00:28:00]  She said, I love you.  Kind of like, yeah.  Hi, grandma.  Yeah.  Kind of like, I love you.  Like, like if a kid walks up and goes, I love you.  You go, I love you.  She might as well said, I'm just being polite.  Oh, are you guys, you know, doing the nasty?  No, no, no, no.  Do you see each other every day?  We both have to get our, our, our things together.  I have to, I'm losing weight.  I'm almost under 300 pounds.  I svelte under 300 pounds.  Well, uh, today will help. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  How much did you weigh when we met you?  I was three Oh one.  Pushing three 50, three 50.  All right.  So you lost almost 50 pounds.  Not bad.  Yeah.  And when, when, when do you think you're going to have sex with this, uh, this fine, uh,  I'm not even worried about that.  I'm not taking your time.  I'm trying to get my, I've been trying to get my stuff together for many years and I  think it's going to go real quick.  Here's a reason now.  I'm yeah, I haven't been able to have a,  reason to get out of bed, to get out of bed, to hop in the shower, to get out there and 
[00:29:00]  grab life by the earth and, and, and, and have a good time now with somebody.  I woke up, she made me wake up in a trailer one day and say, this place stinks.  I got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For the people that don't know, Pat has an awful trailer.  He lives in a trailer that is literally at the end of the runway at Teterboro litter at 
[00:29:30]  the end of the runway at Teterboro.  And there's holes in it and you can see the ground when you're in the bathroom and all this  stuff.  The water heater rotted out the floor and it fell right through the bottom of the trailer.  But now you're aware that your living environment stinks.  Like I've woken up.  Yeah.  You've had an awakening.  Hey, very cool, man.  But, but now, um, do you see each other every day?  Uh, pretty much.  Yes.  Do you talk to each other on the phone every day?  Yes.  And is it a, uh, uh, friend conversation or is it, you know, you could tell when it's 
[00:30:00]  two people in love having a conversation because do you pull the, you hang up first?  No, you hang up.  Okay.  We'll both hang up on three.  One, two, three.  Yeah.  You didn't hang up.  Or is it more like you're talking and she's like, look, I'll hang up first.  Click.  Just click.  Pat's still talking.  She's winning the who'll hang up first game.  Undefeated.  78 to zero. 
[00:30:30]  I'll say though, I had a friend, a girl I'm dating, I was friends with for, for years  first and I liked her and she didn't like me and we just stayed friends.  I mean, it was really weird.  It's so, it's like, it's possible, but you gotta be patient.  Three years.  Yeah.  I realized I might be feeling things ahead of time.  Oh, boy.  We're just waiting.  Well, let me, let me tell you how this can go.  Oh, this girl can, uh, fall, uh, head over heels in love with Pat, which I hope the best  for Pat. 
[00:31:00]  You're starting from the, from the rare possibility first.  That, why don't you just say, Anthony, like, look, we have to say this because statistically  it's a possibility.  Right.  It's a, a slim possibility.  Exactly.  I didn't buy a ticket.  And everything can work out fine and dandy.  And that would be the best thing for you.  Yeah.  Or if this girl, if this girl breaks up with him, not even breaks up because I don't really  see this cohesive relationship yet.  Yeah.  How are you going to do it?  There will be Pat in his trailer of shit. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  Are you going to blow your brains out?  Are you going to slit your wrists?  What are you going to do?  Yes.  Because this will end in a suicide if she blows you off.  How will you kill yourself when, when she does leave you?  Wow.  Well, I, I do drive for a living.  Oh, he's going to take out an innocent victim with them.  No.  Bridge apartment.  Something like that.  The corner of a, where the bridge, like where there's a fork in the road and there's  a big concrete barrier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's already thinking about it.  Something like that.  And just cut yourself in two.  You've already thought about it. 
[00:32:00]  Just do us a favor and have some kind of spectacular Opie and Anthony death for us.  All right.  Oh yeah.  Lots, lots of.  Make sure I'm wearing an ONA shirt.  Lots of signage on the vehicle.  Lots of signage on the vehicle.  ONA party rides.  Hey, let's go to Frank in Jersey.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Jesus Christ, Pat.  You're supposed to be the one vomiting.  Hold on, man.  Let Pat put his headphones on.  Go ahead.  Say it again.  Gee, Pat, Pat's supposed to be the one vomiting.  Not getting the rest of the audience to vomit.  That's my secret weapon.  Let Pat have some, let Pat have some love. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Pat needs some love.  I, I feel you're not going to win the contest this year.  You're, you're, you're too much in love.  He's distracted.  There's a distraction.  You don't have your eye on the prize.  No, you certainly don't.  I got a cold.  He's got a cold and he's just thinking about love.  Yeah, who cares?  Is it all consuming?  Are you just, do you only think about her?  I'm driving and red light, green light.  Who cares?  I'm sure it was green a minute ago.  Oh, he's, he's so in love.  Oh, Pat. 
[00:33:00]  You've, and you've never been in love together.  We watched Legends of the Fall and we were crying.  I pretend I'm Tristan coming back from World War I with the scalps on.  Oh, you're disgusting in love.  She's my little Indian girl who grew up and she's pregnant with my girl and actually gets  shot with a ricochet bullet off the mountain.  Oh, my baby.  Holy Jesus.  You rule, Pat.  You're watching the fifth element. 
[00:33:30]  I said, you're the fifth element.  That's love.  Let's stop that fireball of evil coming at birth.  Where's she now?  Still tied up in the trailer?  Yeah.  She's here.  Oh, do we get to meet her?  Can we meet her?  Why is she nice?  We'll be nice and be courteous, Opie.  We'll be nice.  Don't look at me.  Opie, I'm looking at you.  Opie, don't look at me.  I'm looking at you.  Be nice.  I'll be nice. 
[00:34:00]  I'll march right out of here.  Oh, see?  Oh.  He's our ringer, too.  I'm an old squeeze play.  He's our ringer.  And we might know this girl?  Yeah, you might have seen her before.  All right.  All right, bring her in.  Is it Paul's wife, Denise?  No.  No.  I'm not a boob man.  Can you say that?  You're a boob.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  Man.  That's super, man.  All right, a little skid. 
[00:34:30]  You stopped.  Yeah.  We're going to get the eggnog drinking contest started very, very soon.  Right around 7 o'clock.  Where's the lovely...  She's walking in the door, I guess.  It's a big cat.  Why is E-Rox smiling real wide?  Here's Pat from Minocchi's chick.  E-Rox retarded.  Hi.  She's my friend I spend time with.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Hello.  Good.  Hello.  Got a microphone there.  You do look familiar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trying to place it, Pat. 
[00:35:00]  Trying to place...  I'm not that good.  Opie's great with faces and memories.  He's pretty good.  No?  Nothing?  She's got a cute little Christmas hat on.  I got that for her yesterday.  She's a pretty girl.  And the hat is...  It's got, like, glowing...  It's like a circle of stars.  Yeah, so Pat can see her.  A Cylon.  So Pat, yeah.  So she's running down the street in the dark.  He knows who to tackle.  When she's in the woods, you're like, help me? 
[00:35:30]  He'll use that glowing hat.  So I get those infrared glasses.  Yeah.  So you're at Pat all the time.  Do the moths flying around bother you?  Or the girl in the well?  The girl in the well.  Wait a minute.  So how did you meet Pat?  How did we meet?  Well, first, Pal Talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, that old Pal Talk, man.  I got to tell you.  You got to love.  Love is in the air on Pal Talk. 
[00:36:00]  So you met on Pal Talk.  Little...  What was it?  In the O&A fan room or...  Uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the live room.  The live room.  The live room.  Okay, at first.  Right.  And then did you...  How...  Because there are so many people.  I don't understand how you, like, zero one out like a gazelle on the plains of the  Serengeti.  How did you decide this one is any different than any of the other girls that won't talk  to you?  No, actually, I met her at, uh, at, uh, like an Owen, a Pal Talk O&A thing.  Yeah.  Oh.  Maybe F.H. 
[00:36:30]  Riley's?  No, not that one.  Hey, did you say F.H.  Riley's?  And, uh, a place in Huntington, right?  My brother's restaurant?  All right.  And my restaurant?  Yeah, of course.  400 New York Avenue in, uh, Huntington Village?  Who doesn't know that, Opie?  F.H. Riley's, that's right.  And, and we all know what the F.H. stands for.  Right.  Now, so you met on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  And, uh, how did it develop from there?  Uh, well, I met her at the, uh, that little Pal Talk function, and we got to talking, and  then... 
[00:37:00]  You got to talking?  ...we spent time.  And then moved down here.  Yeah.  And stayed.  Yeah.  Oh, you moved?  Yeah.  I was from Missouri.  Where were you?  Missouri.  Missouri?  Yes.  Did you move down here because of business or for Pat?  For Pat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You moved for Pat?  Yes.  That is sweet.  And you're living in his trailer?  No.  No.  No.  Wait, you're not living in his...  Did you move out of your trailer, or you get, like, what's...  Where are you living?  Uh, I'm living in my trailer, Jim.  She's staying with a friend, and is the... 
[00:37:30]  I gotta ask, is this friend a guy?  Yes.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus and baby Jesus.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's okay.  It's platonic.  Is the guy...  Is the guy friend gay?  No.  All right.  That would have been the only...  I'm hoping.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  It's all right.  I could kick his butt.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, let him know.  I go over there every day, and I make sure.  I give him the I.  Well, what's your name? 
[00:38:00]  Tanya.  Tanya.  And are you in love with Pat?  We're good friends.  I love you, Pat.  See?  Oh, wow.  That's it.  It's breakfast.  Pat, Pat, I just want you to...  Tanya?  I love you.  I love you.  Oh, God.  Pat, I want you to...  It's like I was playing handball.  Just bounce back at me.  It's going to end in a suicide.  Pat, I got to tell you, please slow down.  Slow down.  It's suicide.  I'm getting intel. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm getting intel here.  I happen to know where she lives.  Oh, really?  I'm shocked.  I happen to know where she lives.  Oh, please, God.  Now, how did this living arrangement come about?  Just, I don't really know.  Was it an offer by this gentleman?  Yes.  That you live?  Did you move up here because of Pat or because of an offer that you had a place to stay? 
[00:39:00]  I came up, yeah, an offer for a place to stay.  An offer for a place to stay.  Yes.  Now, did this gentleman contact you before or after Pat?  We all...  I think I knew him before you, but...  Yes.  Okay.  And then he came over one day to his house, and then we all became, like, the three musketeers.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't want the...  We spent Thanksgiving together.  You don't want the three musketeers in a relationship, Pat.  The important question is...  You don't.  Does the other guy like you? 
[00:39:30]  Yep, Desk.  I don't know.  Ah.  Of course he does.  Oh, my God.  This is going to end in a short time.  Women always know.  Women always know.  They can make sense.  That is our rendezvous.  Freeze company, too.  Let me tell you why.  Yeah, go ahead.  There's a problem.  Make it...  Make it...  We met at the Regal Beagle.  Hold on.  They're all over it on PalTalk.  They're all over it on feedback and on the phones.  But you've got to explain it to the rest of America there, Anthony.  Would you like to maybe reside at my house?  I believe I could put a roof over your head, give you, you know, a place to stay and some food. 
[00:40:00]  We could watch Tom and Jerry cartoons.  It's more like...  I got the box set.  Perhaps I could use you as a dependent and write you off on my taxes and...  Perhaps you could help build a dojo.  So it's true you live with Master Poe.  Yes.  You live with Master Poe.  Who's one of the protectors of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Master Poe, who, you know, with all due respect to Master Poe, is one of the biggest perverts... 
[00:40:30]  Is he really?  ...I've ever seen in my life.  Is Paul perfect?  The guy will try to pick up any girl on two legs.  And he doesn't even bother taking them back home.  He just, you know, does what he has to do in the parking lot.  Of where?  F.H. Riley's.  F.H. Riley's in Huntington.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village, my brother's restaurant.  I've never seen our guys uncomfortable before. 
[00:41:00]  Sam and Danny and Nathaniel are all uncomfortable.  It's not going to be a walkover today.  It's going to be a walk away.  Oh, people are wondering if Pat enjoyed the free turkey that was supposed to be my turkey.  You had a celebrity turkey at Thanksgiving.  All right.  Listen.  My turkey.  So, Pat from Monarchy, you're in love.  Yes.  I'd like to say that to the world.  She's not quite in love with you.  But you're hoping that she might see it your way.  She's living with Master Poe. 
[00:41:30]  Who's got to be getting naked with her on a nightly basis.  What are the sleeping arrangements?  Hey.  Well, you got to.  My thing went off.  What are the headphones went off?  Your headphones aren't working?  Can we fix them?  Because we definitely wanted to hear this.  Yeah.  I just want to know what the sleeping arrangements are over at the Poe compound.  There's a fold-out bed.  I want to hear from her.  When he sleeps upstairs in a bed, I sleep on a couch.  If he falls asleep on a couch, I sleep upstairs in the bed with the dogs. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  We've heard about his dogs.  So, it's an upstairs-downstairs thing all the time.  Right.  Yes.  Am I getting a little personal?  You don't have to answer.  Has there ever been cohabitation of a sleeping environment at the Poe household?  No.  Pat.  Pat's question-walking.  Pat is, yeah, just like, no.  We all spoon.  We all spoon. 
[00:42:30]  Poe tries to fork me.  Do you guys kiss or anything?  No.  There's been friendly little, you know.  But Pat's saying that he's in love.  Yeah, do you understand that Pat is head over heels completely as far as a guy could be in love with somebody,  he is in love with you?  Yes, he tells me that daily.  He does.  Yes.  And you, what are your true feelings right now for Pat? 
[00:43:00]  He's like my best friend.  I do anything for him.  Well.  I'm not in love with him.  But you're not in love with him.  Right.  Do you think in the future that something can change, that these things can change, and  that maybe you could have feelings for Pat like he has for you?  I don't know.  We'll see.  See?  That's, there's hope.  Sounds good to me.  That is a really, really nice note.  We went to FAO Schwartz yesterday and danced on the big piano.  Oh, my God. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, Pat.  Oh, no.  Oh, Pat.  Stan's holding up a break sign, and it's for Pat's heart.  Because I just see this really ending tragic.  This has all the ingredients of a car bomb.  It really does.  I'm trying to think for a shark, and I said, this, Tanya, she broke my heart.  Yeah.  I'm thinking this ends in double murder-suicide.  Murder-suicide.  Double murder-suicide.  Double murder-suicide.  Poe, Tanya, and Pat. 
[00:44:00]  And then Pat puts the gun in his mouth.  Yeah.  Do it in the mouth.  Can you guys kiss before we take a break?  Can you kiss before we take a break?  Aw, come here.  Aw, look.  Here we go.  This will say a lot.  She goes, she went, mwah.  Mwah.  Whenever there's a noise after the kiss, it's not good.  Yeah.  And then the pat on the back, like, when you give the hug, it's like,  Jimmy's so right.  If there's a noise after the kiss, forget it.  Yeah.  Forget it, Pat.  Like a gunshot. 
[00:44:30]  Pat, listen to your pals.  Forget it.  Yeah, Pat.  I'm sorry.  Remain friends.  I have no choice.  They're saying, run, Pat.  But I got to say, I was friends with someone for three years, and I liked her the whole  time, and it didn't happen at first, so it's not crazy.  Yeah.  But she turned me down a year before.  Well, I'm in the middle of a transition stage.  Let's see what happened during that time.  Jim Norton gets a TV show.  Jim Norton on a popular radio show.  Jim Norton moves to a posh apartment uptown. 
[00:45:00]  Jim Norton has a steady income.  Jim Norton loses weight.  All that means, Jim Norton not really loved.  Circumstantially, Jim Norton improved.  The garbage that he is has not.  Jim Norton constantly explaining past and going, that didn't happen.  Jim Norton constantly diverting her away from message boards and other things.  All right, Pat.  She's not attracted to me now, but I'm going to lose 80 pounds in the next three months.  Did you know that Pat, because women always know, did you know he was attracted to you? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, he told me.  Before he told you, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he told you that he was attracted to you.  He's always saying, oh, hot, and we have a song, so he's always like, points it at me.  I never listen to words of songs.  I go, oh, that's you and me.  What's the song?  A lot of them.  Well, the one, what's the one we sing all the time in the car?  All Right Now.  Bye.  All Right Now.  Now, baby, it's all right now, because it's all right now.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, well.  She's arrived in your life.  In fact, company, it's all right.  All it means to her is that you're not making a left turn.  I take what I want.  Baby, I want you.  There you go.  This is nothing but trouble, Pat.  I just see.  Nothing but trouble.  Burning in flames.  Right.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  All right, we got to take a break.  When we get back, we're going to start the eggnog drinking contest.  Maybe we'll learn a little more about this disaster.  That is Pat's first attempt at love. 
[00:46:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  You've been in love before, right?  No.  No.  You know what?  Looking back, in retrospect, I've been infatuated before, but never in love.  This is totally different.  We have to take a break.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  I really want to ask Pat questions.  Yeah, we will.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  By a long shot.  We're going to start drinking the eggnog next, okay?  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show is headed to Florida, and you're not.

Isn't that great? 
[00:48:30]  I've actually been trying to explain it to people.  That sound is that gurgling, sucking chest wound kind of sound.  A gallon of eggnog hitting a hefty bag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Always hilarious.  And we learned that Pat from Munaki's in love with someone that's not in love with him.  During the break, I hope the rest of America understands we're all just walking around going,  oh God, no.  Oh, no.  This is just going to end in a suicide.  Yeah, it's going to be bad.  You can't explain, I was trying to tell my girlfriend about the audio of the pukey, 
[00:49:00]  and you cannot explain to a girl the beauty of vomit audio.  There's no way to make that translate across the country.  No.  The chicks just don't dig vomit audio.  No, it's almost like Three Stooges type thing, or, you know, it's just a girl gene.  You think puke, it's a form of slapstick?  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It's one of those things that girls just go, I don't get it.  It's disgusting.  I don't get it.  Why don't you go grow up?  It's just stupid.  I watched Jackass 2, and there was a scene where Steve-O was wearing some kind of space 
[00:49:30]  helmet thing, and he pukes in it.  And it's a glass fishbowl, pretty much, on his head, and he's vomiting into it, and it's  filling up with puke.  And I'm roaring.  It is just the funniest thing.  And girls, like, just don't find that funny.  I don't know why I find it funny, but it just is.  She comes running in, she thinks you're watching, like, Sleepless in Seattle.  Tom Hanks said something cute. 
[00:50:00]  And all you're getting is this.  And laughter.  Guys are pretty simple.  By the way, professional camera dude, where are you from?  From HDNet.  HDNet is filming the eggnog drinking contest?  Yes, we are.  Are we going to have details on when this is going to air?  Absolutely.  All right, we'll keep everyone informed, but we've got a real camera dude in today.  HDNet helping us out today.  All right, bring in the contestants.  You know, puking in widescreen, that's what it's all about, right? 
[00:50:30]  And high def, so you'll know exactly what they had for dinner last night.  High def digital video.  Hey, I see some familiar faces.  Sergeant Magoo, we got...  Ah, there's Sergeant Magoo.  What a show he put on for the Pal Talkers yesterday.  Did you hear about this, Bill?  Uh-uh.  Yesterday on Pal Talk, Sergeant Magoo, we had a lot of people come in and audition for this  because we want real contenders, not these slouches that are going to come in and be out in the first two shots.  Sergeant Magoo on Pal Talk was home drinking milk, eating sticks of butter with ketchup on it. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  And vomiting into Tupperware, which he then, filled with Froot Loops, got a big spoon, and started eating.  It was fantastic.  It was like I was watching Ali back in the late 60s, early 70s, kind of that type of champion.  This is a man who obviously wants to win and has what it takes to win this competition. 
[00:51:30]  I like how they gave him the shoulder holster taping of his name.  Yeah.  What the hell are you guys doing?  Taping name tags on these people.  All right.  Hey, where is that video, by the way, Sergeant Magoo?  Right now, one person that was filming, it got messed up, so we're trying to get the other people to get it up online right now.  By the way, not just name tags.  I asked for Stars of David.  Why don't I get what I...  We're trying to get it up right now.  Yeah, the mic is a little low.  What are we doing over there?  We need a little more volume.  I'm pinned over here.  All right.  We also have Doug Out Doug is here from a fine website, OAExperience.com. 
[00:52:00]  That's how we promote it over here?  Yes, sir.  There you go.  He runs a great fan site.  Thank you.  Also known as FBA, but you got to figure out what FBA stands for.  Pleasure.  OAExperience.com to check out Doug Out Doug's fine website.  Has there been any dissension in the ranks between the whack bag people and FBA?  Because I see a whack bag shirt over there.  I know there's a board altercation going on between Doug's board and whack bag board wars. 
[00:52:30]  It's all in good fun.  Oh, it's all in good fun.  Some of the stuff I read sure doesn't look like fun.  You guys are hitting well below the belt.  Who is this gentleman here that Danny's got the mic in front of with the whack bag shirt?  I'm Generoso.  Oh, Generoso.  Yes, I've seen your name many times.  Yeah, well, the fan sites are fighting all the time.  Yeah, it's just a battle.  It's some kind of Lord of the Flies thing. 
[00:53:00]  I'm waiting for somebody to push a rock on Piggy.  But I'm not sure which one is Piggy.  I think it's all of them.  So we got a lot of rocks.  We got whack bag representing today in the eggnog drinking contest.  All the websites, by the way, are linked up on our site, opianathony.com.  Who else we got we want to talk to?  We got Flea back there, I see.  He was putting on a show the other day for us.  Yeah, Flea, how you doing?  Doing pretty good.  Skinny little bastard.  You think you got a shot at this?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  No, I don't.  He drank a lot. 
[00:53:30]  He drank a quart of milk, and then he drank a quart of half and half, and he drank a quart  of heavy cream.  He did boof.  He did puke, but you kept drinking.  Yep.  You do know if you puke here, you're out.  There's no buyback.  You can't buy back in.  Yeah, the contest is really easy.  These guys are going to drink a double shot of eggnog every single minute until they puke.  When they puke, they are out of the competition.  How many contestants we're going with, guys?  We got what, about 10 or so?  10.  All right, we got 10 contestants.  I see Pat, of course, the favorite. 
[00:54:00]  Pat from Minaki has got to be the favorite.  But love might put a damper on his competitive spirit with this whole thing.  He might have to, you know, fill his...  Oh, what?  Oh, yeah, a girl contest.  Thanks, Steve.  We got any money going on?  Anything going on here?  There's a little action, a little side action.  Side action.  People are betting in their cubicles right now, Bill.  But this is purely for just the...  You don't condone that kind of activity.  No, we don't condone betting when it comes to eggnog drinking until you puke. 
[00:54:30]  Why would we?  It's about dignity.  It's not about betting and money.  I can't pick a favorite.  You need some little skinny Asian guy.  They're the ones who always...  Oh, you got the skinny flea.  Favorite was Pat.  And we got a chick this year.  I don't think we've ever had a chick in the eggnog drinking contest.  I would be the first.  You are the first, huh?  Who are you?  My name is May.  I live here in New York.  Hey, May.  Hi.  Big fan of the show?  Absolutely.  Who put your tape on, by the way?  Made sure it went right over your left breast. 
[00:55:00]  Master Poe.  I can put the tape on.  Yeah.  Master Poe in the parking lot.  So, this is like, I listened to it last year, a year before.  Yeah.  You really think you can get some shots down?  Yeah, I think I'm...  How many do you think you're good for?  I can probably do about 30.  30?  Are you a woofer?  I'm just a big eater.  Can you puke, though, without a problem?  Yeah, I just usually don't puke.  You don't puke.  All right.  Well, this is something that a lot of people that have never puked... 
[00:55:30]  And she's confusing the audience.  She's saying she's a big eater, but you're not a big girl.  No, I'm just a big eater.  And, by the way, someone has to say you have a lovely set there.  Thank you.  All the way, May.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey.  All the way, May.  Leave all the way, May out of it today.  Well, we're just saying maybe she'll be the champ and go all the way.  Hey.  Not like you're all the way, May.  You're a great aunt.  Nice staying on the back seat that a helicopter can land on.  Bill, remember the show where they went after your grandmother?  Was it your grandmother?  Yes, it was. 
[00:56:00]  Where the abuse was brutal?  Well, now they're doing it to my great aunt.  His great aunt is the actual All the Way May, the character that Madonna played in League of Their Own.  His great aunt was the actual one.  It's a true story.  She's a nun now to try to make up for all the...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Well, you know all the gentlemen were off fighting a war, so God knows what she was with.  No, All the Way May.  Retards, cripples.  And the entire Negro League.  People with flat feet. 
[00:56:30]  Flat feet.  Bill?  Bill?  Flat footprints on the Studebaker windshield.  You know how much this could hurt.  Don't go there.  This hurts.  It's all the way May because she was a really good hitter, that's all.  And she went around the bases a lot.  Yeah, she sure did.  All right.  Heard a song about it once with Phil Rizzuto in it.  All right, who else do we want to talk to?  Pat wanted to say something while the girl was talking.  Oh, Pat.  Pat had something as you were driving in, right?  Are you in love with her, too, now?  No, I was just going to say, well, before you said it, I said, I think May's going to go all the way. 
[00:57:00]  So.  Oh.  So, yeah.  All right, Pat, thank you.  Was your first born named 4F?  All right.  Wow.  Now, Pat was the favorite right up until today, for me, anyway.  I would have put all my money on Pat.  I think this love thing is going to screw you up.  I also think.  I'm filled up with love.  It's going to be in the back of your head that she's making out with somebody else in the hallway.  You've got to be honest.  What, did you hear something?  You've got to be honest.  You're going to be really distracted.  You're going to be thinking the whole time, God, is she flirting or making out with someone in the hallway as I try to impress her by drinking a lot of eggnog today? 
[00:57:30]  Why, what did you hear?  And who's the guy in the blue in the back?  Yeah, now here's a guy that I'm thinking there might be a problem with.  Huh?  Jerry.  What's up, Jerry?  What's your story?  Jerry.  Just listening to the radio.  Yeah.  I want to drink a lot of eggnog.  Puke.  Doug is saying, turn around.  Why turn around?  Saturated.  Oh, wow, you're sweating like that.  Are you sweating?  A little nervous.  You're about six, what, four? 
[00:58:00]  Six, six.  Six, six?  Okay, and how much do you weigh?  Four, sixty.  Four, sixty.  Wow.  He's our biggest competitor.  You don't look four, sixty, though.  You don't look four, sixty.  Because he's a very tall guy.  Yeah, that's true.  He looks three, eighty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smelt three, eighty.  Now, have you done anything as far as eating a lot or not on a daily basis?  He knows your thing.  But I mean, he only eats one meal a day, but it's a water buffalo.  What do you think your chances are? 
[00:58:30]  I think they're pretty good.  Pretty good?  Yeah.  I did six pitchers of beer in an hour and didn't blow.  Wow.  Pat, you're in trouble.  Six pitchers in an hour.  All right, Pat.  I like this guy loosening up his neck right there with the psycho haircut.  Oh, my God.  Who is this little fella?  Psycho.  Who are you?  What's up?  I was here last week.  I was drinking milk.  Oh, yeah.  You're the milk guy.  All right.  I didn't see you.  He just spiked his head up a little more.  Yeah.  Your video's up on YouTube.  It's getting viewed pretty well.  I can find it.  Yeah, it's up there.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Good deal.  All right.  Anybody else we want to talk to?  I see Sergeant Magoo has his Froot Loops just in case he pukes. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, Sergeant Magoo.  Step up to him, Mike.  Yes, gentlemen.  Yeah, you brought the Froot Loops now.  In case you puke, you're going to reenact what you did on Pal Talk with the Froot Loops.  Hey, I'm here to entertain, and we're going to have some fun today, so I'll do whatever  needs to be done.  Well, not whatever, but we'll have some fun.  Yeah.  All right.  Anybody else we want to talk to?  Anyone else have an interesting story?  Who's the guy in the back there that we didn't speak to?  Your name, sir?  Hi, I'm Shane.  Hi, Shane.  You're Shane?  I'm going to go on courses thing.  I'm going to win it all.  Oh, really? 
[00:59:30]  You think you're kind of just the Richard Dreyfuss?  I'm a closet eater.  Whose colon is it anyway?  You're a closet eater?  I'm a closet eater, man, and me and my friends have little competitions.  I always beat them, so I figured I'd bring it out to the main stage.  Really?  Yep.  All right.  That's that faux confidence I've seen so many times.  Yeah, we've seen it over the years.  It's refreshing, because then after a few shots, you ask him, how are you doing?  He goes, well, it could be a problem.  No, no, absolutely not.  All right.  All right.  I think we're ready, Anthony.  All the confidence. 
[01:00:00]  Who are you picking?  God, I want to go with Pat so bad.  This love thing has got me.  The love thing.  Has Pat won it yet?  Yeah, the first one.  He won the first one.  He should have won.  Last year, he set the record, but lost the contest.  Oh, he lost it.  The weird thing where he took the shot that put him over the top.  He had more shots than the other guy.  There were only two left, but he puked before the other guy puked.  It's all about who pukes first.  Who pukes first.  You've got a minute to do that shot, and Badlands decided he was going to sit and wait, wait 
[01:00:30]  it out.  When Pat did the shot immediately, then Pat puked.  Badlands didn't have to do the shot.  Wow.  And then he puked pretty much right after Pat.  It was bad close last year.  It was so close.  Hey, Pat, what's the record?  71.  71.  As you've seen the checkered flag.  Right.  Same thing.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Everyone's talking.  I'm sorry about that.  I was yelling over you guys.  But the record is 71 double shots of eggnog.  That's what we're looking for today.  Do we have an organized squad that can fill all these cups in the allotted time?  All right.  We own two guys. 
[01:01:00]  Didn't we have more last time?  I don't like this.  We might want to get a third guy.  Just in case.  Just in case.  If there's a problem on the first round, make sure we get some ready reserve in there.  They look like they're going to go Christmas caroling.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Just to set it up for everybody at home.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  We've got puke buckets all over the studio.  We've got tons of eggnog.  Like these guys will do a double shot of eggnog every single minute until they puke.  They puke.  They're out.  Until one guy is standing. 
[01:01:30]  And they will be doing it through commercial break.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to take a break.  We talked to you?  No.  Oh, okay.  We didn't talk to him.  Amish beard.  Real quick.  What's your name, sir?  My name's Pat.  Pat.  And where do you hail from?  I hail from New Jersey.  I was going to say Jersey.  Ah, geez.  Yeah.  Jersey is just, you could see it a mile away.  And what's your story?  I go to the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Good old CSB.  And I want to intern here, but I figured this would be the better way of doing it rather  than just applying.  Not bad. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Not bad.  Make sure you leave your info with Steve or somebody, you know, after you puke.  And Rogan is, uh, yeah, Joe Rogan is joining the party, too.  All right.  Here we go.  Why don't we get the contest going?  We talked to you enough.  Lee, shut up.  I got one quick check.  What do you got, one quick check?  If I lose, Joe Rogan can choke me out.  You're going to lose, and he should choke you out either way.  Hey, Joe, would you choke out Flea for us?  Sure.  All right.  Sure.  Sure. 
[01:02:30]  Joe Rogan in studio playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York City.  I highly recommend you see the comedy of Joe Rogan.  Do you know what type of that?  I am saying that would make YouTube history as far as hits.  Joe Rogan choking somebody out, a skinny little bastard-like Flea.  I've already been choked a radio guy out on YouTube once.  Really?  Yeah, some guy from Boston.  Wow.  Is it Mark Parenteau for hitting on you?  Can we choke out Flea before the competition? 
[01:03:00]  It's probably not the best move.  All right.  Well, Anthony, why don't we get this going?  Who wants to start this up?  Hey, yo, can I do a toast?  Doug?  Can I toast it?  Yeah, Doug out, Doug, from OAExperience.com.  Hey, the big Rich DeSolofist.  DeSolofist.  I can't say the name either.  No one was able to.  Gone but not forgotten.  Maybe worm food, but we're going to toast you today, Rich.  Yeah, we lost one of our faithful listeners, and he has the worst name to try to say on the radio.  DeSolofist.  But he was a great guy, and he was at every single Opie and Anthony event that we ever did. 
[01:03:30]  So, right on, Doug.  Good move.  All right, let's get the eggnog drinking contest going.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Pat.  Tanya, this one's for you, baby.  Oh, it's over.  Dude, she's making out with someone in the hall.  She's not even listening to you.  Oh, no.  All right, start drinking.  The eggnog drinking contest has officially begun.  There's going to be something on our shirt, and he's going to go,  Were you in the eggnog drinking competition, too?  Yeah, they did.  All right, and all you have to do, guys, is drink a double shot of eggnog every single minute. 
[01:04:00]  They all got their first shot down, obviously.  They're holding their second one.  Refilling.  First shot, piece of cake.  Yeah.  This is like, who wants to be a millionaire?  You know, the first few questions, what's your name?  Kind of like that for the hundred dollars.  Eh, first couple, you just know it's going to go fine.  But then after a while, you start seeing faces.  What do you think?  Third shot or fourth shot?  When does it start coming in?  Nah, it's usually around. 
[01:04:30]  They'll get up to ten with not even a problem.  Yeah, anywhere between five and ten, you start seeing a face, and that's when you know to  get the guy to the mic, because he's going to start going, No, I'm okay, I'm okay, but  you see a face.  Yeah, by the way, speaking of that, Anthony, if you are going to puke, you've got to be  a good sport and help us all out.  Make sure you raise your hands so we can get some great audio of you puking.  All right, time for the second shot.  And there they go, the second shot.  Good.  Well, that minute goes really quickly.  All right.  I'm looking at different drinking styles.  Pat just sucks it right down. 
[01:05:00]  Flea took two separate swigs.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Flea is...  That's thicker than I expected.  It's too small.  Is it thicker than you expected?  Yeah.  I don't know what's wrong.  It's eggnog.  Oh, you know what?  This is like the first week of Navy SEAL training where everybody thinks they're going  to make it.  Yeah, yeah.  I can hack this.  I can hack this.  I'm going to be special forces.  And by the end, there's eight guys left out of 2,000.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  Anthony, you know what we should do?  We should take a break. 
[01:05:30]  We'll get them to do the third shot.  They'll continue through the break, and then we'll see where we're at when we get back  with the radio show.  How does that sound?  All right.  We've got Bill Byrne's studio, Joe Rogan, Ari.  Everyone's asking about your videos, The Amazing Racist.  They're up on OPNAnthony.com.  Very funny.  If you're wondering.  Get ready.  Here we go.  The third double shot of eggnog.  And go!  There it goes.  Let me see the technique.  Sergeant Magoo pacing himself.  Doug puts it right down.  He's licking his lips. 
[01:06:00]  Snacking him.  How's the lady doing?  She just puts it right down, too.  Okay.  Nah, it's way too early.  So why don't we take a break?  By the time we get back from break, there'll be close to 10 shots of eggnog.  10 double shots of eggnog.  It's the Eggnog Drinking Contest on the OPNAnthony Show.  It's the annual Eggnog Challenge on the OPNAnthony Show.  It's the OPNAnthony Show.  We now return to the OPNAnthony Eggnog Challenge.  We're back with the OPNAnthony Show. 
[01:06:30]  We're in the middle of the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  Starting to heat up.  The action's starting to heat up.  You're at the studio.  It's already, I swear to you, it's already starting to smell like A in here.  Like swamp ass.  Yeah, there's swamp ass going on in here.  Somebody is guilty of having it.  Well, there's a lot of guys, they're nervous.  They're nervous because they're on a live radio show and they're drinking the eggnog and they're 
[01:07:00]  back to begin with.  Flea.  What about Flea?  Who is it?  Flea Man has swamp ass?  Flea, what's going on with this?  Who's got a...  Flea.  Hi.  Do you have swamp ass?  They're drinking their shot.  Who is it?  Are they saying flea smells?  It's flea?  We need somebody to confirm that.  I don't know.  He walked over here about five minutes ago and I smelled the most wretched smell since  this whole thing started and I was standing by the big guy, Jerry, back there. 
[01:07:30]  His pits smell so bad, he must have not showered.  Who?  Dude, I swear I'm smelling things that are really, really bad.  Because he knows he's going to get choked out in about three minutes.  It's swamp ass.  The smell I've ever smelled, Flea.  Guess you've never eaten out your question.  Oh, wow.  Flea's getting tough.  Oh, boy.  Hey, a little smack.  By the way, for the rest of America, Flea weighs...  How much do you weigh, Flea?  130 tops?  No, I weigh about 155.  Do you?  Ooh.  All right. 
[01:08:00]  And you're going to get choked out by Joe Rogan when you lose the eggnog drinking contest,  right?  Yep.  I will.  All right.  And Doug Out, Doug's not happy with the smell that is emanating from Flea.  Wow.  Yeah, let me have that.  And we're starting to spray the Lysol.  All right.  Where are we at?  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  These guys are drinking a double shot of eggnog every single minute.  How many shots have they done, Steve?  They've done 14.  Kev's pouring the 15th one now.  They've done 14 double shots of eggnog.  Ah, E-Rock's spraying Flea down with Lysol. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, let's see how Pat's doing, Anthony.  Pat!  Oh, I'm doing just fine.  No problem so far?  No.  Anybody having a problem?  Of course, Flea.  Three already?  The cockiest one is the only one having a problem so far.  What's the problem, Flea?  This thing.  Oh, oh.  Hey!  Put your head down.  Too much.  That was it.  That was a little bit.  A little bit. 
[01:09:00]  That was like a burp.  Wait a minute.  We need a judge.  Is he out of the...  No, it wasn't a puke.  It wasn't a puke?  Did he get both feet in bounds?  I think he kind of burped and...  Oh, wait.  Ah, he's out.  That's no burp.  I got...  I tried to single you with it.  Yeah, but you're not drinking it.  You can't just hold it in your mouth and spit it out.  That was a mouthful.  But it's not a date.  Yeah, that wasn't really puking.  Flea's out.  All right, Flea's out.  I'll...  No, dude.  Choke out.  That's it.  Flea is out of the eggnog drinking contest.  Yeah, he wants to be choked out.  Leave the first one. 
[01:09:30]  Flea is only here for Rogan to choke him out.  Where are you going, Flea?  You got to keep your pants on, dude.  Yeah.  Now?  Now?  Now, when do you want to do it?  I thought we'd be out.  All right, after.  Get out of the studio.  We got to make room.  So, we have to say goodbye to Flea.  How many double shots did he almost do?  15?  Wow.  He's out after 15?  Yep.  All right, we're down to nine competitors.  Anybody else feeling a little queasy?  If he's going to get choked out, he should throw up.  Anyone feeling, what, full?  Getting a little full.  It's very thick, but...  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Keep going.  Very thick.  Sergeant Magoo saying it's very thick.  It's getting full.  Did you eat before you came here?  No, I did not.  I planned on eating here.  Yeah?  Oh, shot time, by the way.  Awful.  Shot time, by the way.  There he goes.  Eggnog puke.  Oh, is that the dude that had to throw up with the...  Oh, the Froot Loops.  The Froot Loops, yeah.  He brought his Froot Loops, so he's going to give us a little sideshow later.  Are you really going to eat your own puke with Froot Loops?  He did it yesterday.  He carries those Froot Loops like little John Kelly.  He carries that stupid little cup.  That's his own thing now. 
[01:10:30]  Magoo with some Froot Loops.  I feel like I only have 55 more in me.  Yeah.  We heard that last year.  Yeah.  Hey, and he was right, though.  So, Pat did 72 double shots of eggnog last year.  We'll see if he...  71.  Sorry, I keep saying 72.  71 double shots of eggnog.  That is the current record.  We'll see if anyone beats that this year.  All right, where are we at, Dan?  Got another shot in about 10 seconds.  All right, and this will be...  This will be number 17.  Number 17.  This is going to be the 17th double shot of eggnog. 
[01:11:00]  I think Pat's kind of making a little face like a little bit of a problem.  It's starting to suck a little bit.  You kind of winced when another shot was announced.  Pat?  Yeah.  Not Pat from Monaki.  Pat Duffy.  Creepy beard Pat.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Pat is a...  Loser Pat.  He kind of winced.  Oh, loser Pat.  What about growing up gaudy?  How's he doing?  Which one?  It's right there.  Oh, there you go.  How you doing?  Fine?  I'm just glad I love eggnog. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah?  You really like the eggnog, huh?  A little coat in the stomach now.  And what about a big guy?  How you doing back there?  That's the big fella.  Barely feel it.  Yeah?  He's 6'6", 4...  What was it?  4'60"?  4'60"?  That's nothing for him.  Yeah, okay.  And Doug?  How you feeling?  Doing well.  Doing well.  I love the eggnog.  I've been drinking it all week.  Oh, you've been practicing?  Yeah, I've been drinking, what is it, half a gallon a night.  I've put on like 5 pounds in the past week.  Yeah, good lord. 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  What is his blood sugar right now?  That's awful.  That would be the real contest.  You've been training for this?  Yeah, these guys...  Joe, this is a big thing every year.  This is my first time ever trying eggnog.  Huh?  It's my first time ever trying eggnog.  Really?  It's delicious.  Sergeant Magoo doesn't even have a chance.  He's here to do the Froot Loop trick later.  We're just waiting for the throw-up to happen.  Do we got a bowl?  We got a bowl for Sergeant Magoo?  Oh, a pitcher.  A pitcher, good.  Oh, that is going to really sound horrid.  I'm looking at Pat Duffy over there, and that last shot really was hard. 
[01:12:30]  I probably got another five minutes left.  That's about it.  I love nog, though.  That's the thing.  Huh?  I love nog.  It's so good.  It just sucks to have him so much.  When it comes back, you'll be able to taste it all over again.  Yeah, because I noticed he kind of started drinking that down.  He had to stop.  He had to swallow.  He winced a little and then finished it.  Yeah.  If you're at that point now, you're in trouble.  That's not a lot of time.  Yeah.  Uh-oh. 
[01:13:00]  I got a little pre-puke belch over there.  Yeah.  Which guy?  Which guy?  Just trying to get rid of gases so I can put more room.  Sergeant Magoo is burping, which is a prelude.  We all know that.  Just a little air in the lines.  What about our young lady?  How are you feeling?  I'm doing all right.  They have a sugar rush, so I'm...  Oh, cool.  Yeah?  She has...  She's way too much than I'm used to.  She has...  She has...  Shot.  She has...  Shot.  Shot, guys.  I messed up.  She's got your eyes.  Hold on, hon.  Yes, Jimmy?  She also has a burn victim wig hair.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  How many double shots are we up to?  They just did their 19th double shot of eggnog.  Joe, what do you think so far?  Joe Rogan in studio?  Fascinating so far.  Waiting to see the Magoo.  Yeah, we're all waiting for Sergeant Magoo to eat Froot Loops and puke.  Kevin's getting weak.  You do realize Joe Rogan hosts Fear Factor.  Oh, yeah.  Why am I...  So, this to him is like kindergarten.  Yeah, you're right, man. 
[01:14:00]  This is nothing.  I forgot who I was talking to.  It just bothers...  It doesn't even bother me.  All right.  You need diced cow intestines inside the eggnog.  We've talked to him over the years.  Will it bother you when you see Sergeant Magoo puke into a pitcher, then add Froot Loops and eat that?  Yes.  That will be up there, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  Anybody eating their own puke, that's hardcore.  How about if Magoo ate someone else's puke?  That's even more hardcore.  All right.  Watch how many people start puking after Sergeant Magoo eats the Froot Loops in his own puke.  Especially being all queasy. 
[01:14:30]  Uh-oh, we got a girl.  Uh-oh.  What's happening?  We might be losing somebody.  I like her.  It's way too much eggnog.  Come on, chug it.  Chug it.  You got it.  You got it.  Come on.  Chug it down.  All right.  We might be losing...  Chug it down.  ...the only female in the competition.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  She's still in.  You got to do it for the ladies.  Yeah.  Come on.  We want to see a girl puke so bad.  That's right.  There you go.  There's a whole other glass for you.  Right after that one.  She had a real tough time down in that one.  The beauty of this contest, it starts off where everyone's like, oh, it's a piece of cake. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I got it.  Double shot every minute, and then that minute starts coming by way too fast.  What are we up to?  This is the 20th?  This is the 21st.  The 21st double shot of eggnog.  And here we go.  Wow.  Okay.  She's having a hard time.  Oh, boy.  She's sipping.  Keep that mic ready, young Dan.  Yeah, they're getting the mics ready and everything.  You know what?  You got to just pound it.  It's the only way to do it.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow, that was hot. 
[01:15:30]  Pat's already trying to find his new girlfriend.  No, I just can't do it.  His current one is making out with somebody in the hall.  Uh-oh.  We got another.  We might lose a couple guys here.  Pat.  Oh, Pat.  Oh, nice.  Oh, wow.  It's so cold. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I bow to you today. 
[01:16:30]  Did he drink a gallon before he came here?  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  Can I get an intern job?  Oh, that's the intern.  Yes.  Hire him.  Yeah.  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy is out.  What's your name again?  Wow.  Pat.  That's Pat.  That was Pat.  That's me, Pat.  Pat, we've been doing this.  Hold on.  We've been doing this for three years.  I've never seen anyone puke that much.  That was power booting. 
[01:17:00]  That could be the best puke we've seen in three years.  Power boot.  I did Fear Factor for six seasons.  I never saw anybody throw up like that.  That was some puking, man.  I'll throw up on the street on the walkover.  All right.  Yes.  Oh, God, yes.  That'll be fine.  Don't count me out yet.  Dude, congrats.  You have probably the best puke sound effects.  That's awesome.  By the way.  It sounded like it was on loop.  Yeah.  No, that was one guy puking over and over again.  By the way.  With the exact same noise.  By the way, we did a really good job there.  When these guys start puking, we've got to try to stay as quiet as possible. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, it's really hard.  It really is hard because it is so freaking fun.  How's Mae doing?  She's done.  Mae?  You're out, Mae?  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, the guys had to continue drinking double shots of eggnog during that whole mess.  So let's see where we're at.  We lost Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire for an intern.  Awesome.  And I guess we lose our only female competitor, Mae, there.  Oh, Mae, you're out, huh?  All right.  Guys, can't take all the sugar.  Can't take all the sugar.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  That hairdo is awful.  Jimmy, do you mind if they stand over here to check out the rest of the game?  Magoo is teetering?  No.  I thought when she bent over to puke, it was going to fall off.  All right.  As long as I stand back a little.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Where are we at?  Magoo is teetering.  He's got to get that shot down.  We're up to the 24th double shot of eggnog.  Sergeant Magoo is making his way to the bucket.  All right.  He has a pitcher in his hand.  He's trying.  The bar's been raised so high now.  Yeah.  That was amazing. 
[01:18:30]  That was all in him?  I couldn't believe it.  I know.  It kept coming like that.  It just...  That was like what?  Like 11?  I think he puked up every shot that he drank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Individually.  Yeah, individually.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Someone's got to count that for us.  I think he puked like 10 to 12 individual times there.  They were all gems.  They were all doozies.  Wait till you see the video of that one.  I want that to replace my old puked sound effects.  And people are going to be confused.  They're going to go, that guy had to have been one of the last guys standing. 
[01:19:00]  What do we got?  Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling a little queasy.  All right.  Well...  How many?  It's like right up under the shot.  Shot.  Shot.  There we go.  Another one.  What are we up to?  Chit-chat.  All right, guys.  This is the 25th double shot of eggnog in the eggnog drinking contest.  What was bicep?  What's the record?  71.  71.  71.  Magoo put that one right down.  Oh.  Oh, he's puking.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:30]  He's puking into the pitcher.  And now you can measure it.  Oh, my God.  He's going to fill it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's going to chunk it.  Look at the guy turning his back.  He doesn't want to see it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's a little spittle.  He's filling up the pitcher.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's almost to the top. 
[01:20:00]  Pitcher's full.  Oh, and the rest of them have to continue drinking.  I don't think we're done with the puke.  Oh, my God.  Look at all that.  That almost made me puke.  He filled, completely filled up a huge beer pitcher.  I'm not looking.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, Sergeant Magoo, he's got a pitcher full of puke.  He's got the Fruit Loops.  They're opening up the Fruit Loops.  He's going to do a little thing for everybody, a little side thing for everybody. 
[01:20:30]  It's the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  They have done 25 double shots.  They're up to 26 as we take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the annual Eggnog Challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.  If anybody's close.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now return to the Opie and Anthony Eggnog Challenge. 
[01:21:00]  I'm loving it.  The Eggnog Drinking Contest, number three.  I forgot about the bad part of this.  What's the bad part?  The smell.  Dude, I had to put up a paper towel and then, like, spray it with Lysol, and I'm holding it up to my nose.  It's not a crime scene.  It smells like one.  Anthony, did you want to sip out of that pitcher that Magoo filled?  Shut up.  Magoo filled a pitcher, and I'm telling Anthony in the break that, wait, don't drink it yet. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, don't.  We got to do the big setup for this.  If you swallowed some of that, it would be warm like his stomach, but I guarantee you there's a cool spot in there, like, where the stuff that just went down and his stomach didn't even warm.  You'd suck it down like an oyster.  A cool, like, clot of nog from his stomach would slide down your throat.  I think I'm having more fun.  You look like he's about to puke.  Dude, Joe, by the end of this, we have literally, like, 20, 25 people in this room.  By the end of this, there's going to be a lot of people puking. 
[01:22:00]  I'm having more fun watching Anthony get a little freaked out by this whole thing.  I hate this.  Eric almost threw up.  Eric almost threw up when Sergeant Magoo was filling up the pitcher.  I almost puked, too.  I admit.  Did you?  You know what it was?  It's the visual of filling up something that is supposed to be sanitary.  Let me give the big setup.  We've got a guy getting close to puking here.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  These guys have been drinking double shots of eggnog every single minute.  When you puke, you're out.  We're down to six contestants.  I think we're going to get our... 
[01:22:30]  Oh, double puke.  Down goes full-blown AIDS.  It's just as good coming back up.  Oh, no.  We just lost two competitors.  The cocky nose, Shane.  Oh, oh.  There it goes.  Thug out, Thug. 
[01:23:00]  Thug out, Thug is out of the competition.  Oh, no.  Shane's going.  Shane's going.  Shane's...  Wow, Shane's...  Oh, there goes Shane.  Wow.  He got a running start with that one.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Out of the nose.  Look at Budaki.  He's like John Madden of Puking.  He's just doing the color commentating.  Oh, wow.  And the other guys have to do a shot.  All right.  Hold on.  We lost two, maybe three guys there? 
[01:23:30]  Three.  Growing up...  We just lost three guys.  Three guys right there.  We lost...  Thug out, Thug.  Who else did we lose?  Shane and John.  Shane and John.  What shot was that?  That was the 30-second double shot of eggnog.  We got three guys left in the competition here.  Shane was a victim of the other two guys puking.  He said that those two guys puking made him puke.  Right.  He was facing the wall.  Yep.  Like at the end of Blair Witch.  And other people were puking.  Wait, there's only three guys left?  Three guys left. 
[01:24:00]  We came back from break with six guys, and right away we lost three of them.  Pat, the big...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Oh!  What happened there?  I missed it.  It came out of his nose.  It came out of his nose?  Oh.  Oh.  And Doug's not done yet.  Doug's vomiting more.  And Doug's now vomiting more.  I have to see him now.  Warm-ups really paid off this week, didn't they?  Shane was just wiping off his forehead.  That's how much it's sprayed out.  Wow. 
[01:24:30]  He power-booted through his nose there, Joe.  You heard it.  It was like...  Yeah.  It was like a horse that just won the derby.  All right.  No surprise.  We're down to three competitors, and it's the three biggest guys in the competition.  Pat Fumannaki.  Who's it?  General Rosso?  General Rosso.  From whackbag.com.  Whackbag.  I told him I'd do him proud.  You're in the...  Oh.  More puke going.  Wow.  From some of the guys that are out of the competition.  Oh.  Really?  He's coming out of his nose.  Coming out of his nose.  Goes out as much his nose as it does his mouth. 
[01:25:00]  And then what do we got over there?  Are you all right?  I'm good.  I'm all good.  I'm all good.  Yeah, the 6'6", 460-pound dude is doing fine, too.  Yeah, Jerry doesn't even look nervous.  And so what is it?  Jerry, General Rosso, and Pat Fumannaki left in the competition.  Hey, anybody want to make 20 bucks and just take a sip out of Sergeant Magoo's pitcher?  Yeah.  A nice warm sip.  Well, where is Sergeant Magoo?  He promised us a little thing here.  All right.  You guys are cool, right?  All right, we're going to let the guys continue with the eggnog drinking contest. 
[01:25:30]  That's 33, 34?  Yep.  That's 35.  35.  See how fast this goes?  Wow.  All right, they're up to 35 double shots of eggnog.  Sergeant Magoo, the mic is yours there.  Yes, sir.  So what do you want to do today?  Well, I know I'm here to make Joe Rogan puke, maybe.  Joe, what do you think?  I've got a nice little picture here of eggnog, which I regurgitated.  Yeah.  So I figure maybe put in a little bowl of Froot Loops and we'll enjoy breakfast together.  I see the nice bowl of Froot Loops there on the table. 
[01:26:00]  It needs just a little milk substance.  Oh, no.  A milky substance in there.  Look how...  Oh, my God.  No way.  Oh, God damn it.  No.  It's...  Holy Jesus.  No, it's like...  It's pouring like molasses.  No, Anthony, it's pouring like rice pudding.  It's...  It's...  Rice pudding or pancake batter.  It's pouring like rice pudding.  Thick pancake batter.  Oh, we might lose E-Rock.  E-Rock is losing it over there.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, did you see that pour?  Turn around, E-Rock.  Get on the mic. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, he's eating Froot Loops out of his own vomit.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, you all right?  I didn't know eggnog could clot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock's out puking.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, an innocent bystander gets hit by a straight ball.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Yes, E-Rock is not in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[01:27:00]  He's one of our own.  He's just puking because he just saw Sergeant Magoo  eating the Froot Loops with his own.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock looks worse than anybody in the competition.  E-Rock is so pale right now,  and his eyes are running with water.  E-Rock, look at how thick that is.  Magoo, do that again.  E-Rock, you got to look.  Oh, look, look, look.  Watch, watch, watch.  It's like snot.  Here goes E-Rock.  I almost puked. 
[01:27:30]  Did you?  I had to walk away.  I had to walk away.  You almost puked.  Poor E-Rock.  If I hadn't...  Oh, yes, no.  Oh, we lost Generoso.  Generoso.  We just lost Generoso for white bags out of town.  Sergeant Magoo is taking everybody out of the competition.  Oh, Magoo is carpet bomber.  Magoo's like a suicide bomber.  He really is.  Poor E-Rock.  Oh, look, they're all stuck together. 
[01:28:00]  It's like oyster crackers.  Magoo, why don't you top off the Froot Loops  with a little more what you got in the picture there.  How does it take...  E-Rock again.  Eric is in the garbage.  E-Rock is puking up a storm.  His stupid headphones are still on.  God, that is hilarious.  Take us a break, stupid.  Oh, my God.  That is hilarious.  E-Rock.  Are you all right, E-Rock?  Look, he's going to top off... 
[01:28:30]  E-Rock, watch him pour it.  Look, watch him pour it.  Just watch him pour it.  Look.  Look how thick.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's in the garbage.  What children?  E-Rock is puking.  He's all the way in the garbage can.  I almost lost.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Oh, God.  It's like snot.  Sergeant Magoo continues to eat the Froot Loops with his own eggnog puke. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, and there goes E-Rock.  That he poured from a pitcher.  Oh, adding more sugar.  Oh, wow.  A guy like that on Fear Factor could have cleaned up, man.  Wow.  You can eat your own puke.  What's going to stop here?  He's got snot.  Oh, Eric's a mess.  He really is, Jimmy.  Poor young hawk.  Magoo, hold that under his face a little bit.  Give him something.  What happened to E-Rock?  I threw up my nose.  You threw up your nose?  Out of his nose.  Out of his nose.  Do you want to eat it?  No. 
[01:29:30]  E-Rock is a mess.  This is the most disgusting eggnog drinking contest we've ever had.  We might not set a record.  We're down only two guys at this point.  Oh, God.  Look, there's strings in it.  Oh, there's strings that are connected.  Oh, no.  Oh.  E-Rock, look at it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Every time Sergeant Magoo pours a little more into his Froot Loops, E-Rock loses it.  Where is that stupid Bob Kelly?  Oh, what I mean.  Jesus. 
[01:30:00]  I invite him, but he'd be puking like crazy.  I invite him, but he's orgasms in Washington.  We invite him, but he's got him.  All right.  We've got to get somebody else to take one sip out of Magoo's pitcher.  Someone has to do it.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock's got a stomach like Karen Carpenter.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You can't really see his name tag.  Jerry.  Jerry, right?  Jerry.  Jerry.  Shot.  We got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  Of course, Pat from Menaki, who comes into this competition as the favorite. 
[01:30:30]  And very conky.  And record holder at 71 double shots that he did last year.  Jerry, how are you holding out?  I'm doing perfect.  Doing perfect.  Pat, how about you?  I'm doing right in front of them eating.  Oh, I'm just wonderful.  You're wonderful.  Pat, any ill effect at all?  Can I have some of that when you're done?  You're not going to throw Pat.  Yeah.  Pat's not fazed.  Sergeant McGoo's trying to eat the Froot Loop puke mixture right in front of Pat.  No.  And Pat has no problem with it.  God, that is so hilarious.  By the way, Joe, Pat from Menaki, a diabetic.  Oh.  He has nine toes. 
[01:31:00]  He has nine toes.  And he's taking in all this sugar today.  But he gets.  He's a diabetic and he's taking in all that sugar.  He does get rid of it at the end of the contest.  Yeah, it'll be gone soon enough.  And let me tell you, hearing him let go of all this eggnog, it's like putting on Sergeant  Peppers for the first time.  And it's magic to your ears what you will hear.  Dude.  It's why I'm here today.  Yeah.  I listened to it for a year.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Pat puking is the showstopper. 
[01:31:30]  It really is.  Well, I've heard it.  I've heard it on the radio.  But I think seeing it.  It's like a Hollywood sound effect.  Like, it's so perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got guys in there who couldn't get in there.  A lot of guys drove from a long distance and couldn't get in here because it's too much  of a mess.  Oh, I sneeze.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's going to puke.  No.  Can we get one of those guys in here?  Like, I want to chip in some money and get somebody.  Yeah.  I want somebody.  Hey, we got money.  You'll do it.  Who are you?  He's interned.  This intern will eat Magoo's puke. 
[01:32:00]  How much can we give him?  Oh, my God.  What are we not going to be?  Communists?  All right.  I'm in for 20.  I chip in 100.  Jimmy's got a bit going.  Wait, we got someone else that wants to do it over there.  They're getting more people.  I smell puke if people are walking by.  I threw in 100, so.  Yeah, it's really disgusting, the smell in here.  Yeah, it's gross.  Jimmy, the competition should be they got to try to keep it down.  If they don't keep it down, we go to the next guy and the money goes up.  Okay.  That's what I say we do.  Fair enough.  That's what I say we do.  Maybe I should take back 50, you know, now that I'm thinking of my bravado. 
[01:32:30]  No, thanks.  It's all good.  You know, it's all fun and games.  Jimmy, throw us down 100.  Everybody comes over.  Right, right.  I know.  All right.  Yes.  Where are we at?  How many double shots of eggnog are we up there?  Give me Trump.  That'll be 42.  All right, Anthony, they're doing their 40-second double shot of eggnog on their way, hopefully,  to a new record.  Yes, Sarge, I see it.  Believe me.  He's holding up the pitcher like, look, puke.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, Magoo is a good boy.  He is a good boy.  He's a good boy.  He has really added a whole new element to this.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  He took out, like, three guys.  Yeah, it worked for the show.  Yeah, they were looking at it as they're trying to drink the eggnog.  They probably could have gotten a few more shots.  I'm not saying they would have won or not, but Magoo definitely cramped their style.  I'm sorry, did Steve see that?  What?  Steve didn't see that.  Steve, you've got to see the viscous cube in the pitcher.  You're a tough guy.  Pour on the Froot Loops and then watch Sergeant Magoo eat it.  All right, watch this.  Here's our own Steve.  Pour a little on top, Magoo. 
[01:33:30]  Steve, watch.  I can't see it.  Tattoos, definitely a tough man.  Yeah.  When he pours this...  Look how this mess...  It comes out like rice pudding.  He's pouring it onto another bowl of Froot Loops.  Oh, it's all curdled and sour.  Hawk?  It's the hanger.  Oh, the hanger.  Yeah, there's a hanger on the end of it.  I love it.  I would use the word congealed.  Congealed?  And now he takes his little spoon and his Froot Loops.  I spend a lot of time throwing up after that surgery I had, and this is awful.  And now look, like nothing, he mixes it up. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  He has no problem eating this.  Here he goes.  He's got a spoonful, and here goes Steve.  I don't think E-Rock has any more puke in him at this point.  Dude, that's really vile.  He's dropping it.  He's playful.  Magoo is playful.  It's falling on his shirt.  Yeah.  He's like a little boy enjoying it.  It doesn't look as nasty as I thought it would, to be honest.  No?  No, it really doesn't.  Hey, by the way, I've gotten word from one of our pals, Wink Wink, that sits to my left  here, that Kenny cannot handle this. 
[01:34:30]  No, he can't.  Where is Kenny?  We need him for security.  Get Kenny in here.  Kenny, why isn't our security guy in here?  Get Kenny in here.  We don't know half these guys in here.  Look how many people we have.  I want to ask Kenny a question.  All right, Bill Burr, yes.  Is Kenny in the other room?  Tell him to bring his food in.  He needs to come in here.  I just want to ask him a question.  Yes, Bill.  He actually requested that I stay in here, and he...  Really?  No, Kenny has to come in here.  Here comes Kenny.  20 years on the force.  The smell is really thick in this room, huh?  Yeah.  Kenny, between the...  We need you here.  Lysol.  We feel threatened.  All right, wait, let's get to Kenny. 
[01:35:00]  Kenny's over here.  Club store to Kenny.  You guys don't realize how bad this room smells compared to the rest of the building.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I can't even tell.  I swear, I'm not smelling anything yet.  And I just finished eating my breakfast, too.  Can you just take a look at this, Kenny?  Why don't you watch the show?  Watch Magoo.  This is Sergeant Magoo.  Yeah, get Kenny in, Mike.  Magoo.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  That is a pitcher full of vomit.  No, get Kenny over there.  You know who's worse than me?  Roland is complaining in the other room. 
[01:35:30]  Get Roland in here.  Get Roland in here.  What a...  He's right here.  He threw into the dog.  What a tattletale.  Get Roland in there.  Kenny, where are you going?  You can't leave.  Kenny, stay in here, there.  You don't even have to torture him.  He's just immediately told where the platoon was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're ratting him out.  Two clicks to the right.  I don't like it, but Roland doesn't like it either.  What a snitch.  Roland, you having a tough time?  Get on a mic.  Just find any mic.  Oh.  This is going to be pricey.  Yeah, I just had breakfast, too, and I was like, oh. 
[01:36:00]  Really?  Did you see Magoo pour it?  No.  Look.  All right.  Watch Magoo.  All right.  Get Roland in there, Roland.  Explain to Roland what that is.  Yeah, get Roland in the mic.  He's in front of Sergeant Magoo now.  Magoo's been out of the contest.  A lot of the people puke into the buckets, but Magoo chose to puke into that beer pitcher,  which he is now pouring on Froot Loops.  Watch how it pours.  That was eggnog moments ago.  Oh, it is now a bile-y mess.  Oh, he's drinking, Roland's drinking Coke.  Coke trying to. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, look at that hanger.  Now it's like pouring like yogurt.  It's not even rice pudding anymore.  Oh, God, it's hardening.  It's really starting to congeal.  And now he will, watch this.  Watch this, Roland.  He mixes up the Froot Loops.  Yeah.  Come on, Roland.  Get a nice eyeful.  Come on, Roland.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's for the competition.  No.  All right, let me explain.  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire as an intern.  He's out of the competition, obviously. 
[01:37:00]  Sergeant Magoo has been eating his own Froot Loops puke combination.  Now, Sergeant Magoo gave the concoction to Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy,  so now he's eating Sergeant Magoo's puke on Froot Loops.  Oh, my God.  Eric's about to go again.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  That's so bad.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock is puking again.  Certainly.  And he has nothing to do with this competition.  We're finding the weak stomachs among us.  Look at Bill Burr, not looking so good. 
[01:37:30]  Bill, you all right?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  What happened, Bill?  Bill, did you see that?  Did you watch that, Bill?  What got you?  The fact that he's eating someone else's puke?  Yeah, I can't eat it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was too much.  Hey, where's Club Soda Kenny?  He's right there.  Kenny's here.  Hey, wait a minute.  Hey, would somebody take...  Now, that picture is so awful.  Would somebody take a sip out of it?  Like, without the Froot Loops, just a sip.  Just a nice, thick, yogurty sip.  Oh!  Eric's down.  E-Rock's down.  E-Rock's down again. 
[01:38:00]  Wait, we got to explain, because it's just noise for people out there.  The intern took a big, mouthful sip out of Magoo's pitcher of thick, viscous.  He vomited.  He took a Viking swig.  Pat Duffy, that kid's an animal.  A Viking swig.  And it spilled over his cheeks and chin, ran down his shirt, and splattered on the floor.  That was a victory battle swig.  He just conquered this town and celebrated with Magoo.  The government needs to follow that dude around.  Dude, this kid started as a listener, a competitor.  Now he's an intern. 
[01:38:30]  By the end of the show, you're going to be like a co-host of this show.  And E-Rock, of course, puked again when that happened.  You get E-Rock's job, by the way.  He's got someone else's puke from his mouth on his own shoes.  Yeah.  Dude, did we explain that he just poured the whole pitcher?  He tipped the pitcher into his mouth, and a half-fit went into his mouth, which he swallowed.  Half-fit went onto his chin and his beard after he ate Magoo's puke with Froot Loops on it.  My dad's listening.  My dad's listening.  You raised a tough son of a bitch, sir. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, keep it off the rug.  Keep it off the rug.  You should be proud.  You should be proud.  You should be a Marine.  Yeah, it got right on the edge of the tarp.  All right, let's get back to the competition.  It's Pat from Manaki and Jerry.  Where are you going, Hawk?  We only got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  How many shots are we up to?  You have to go back to the days of, like, Attila the Hun to find that kind of disgusting Roman puke rooms.  Just look at E-Rock's face.  Look how he's sad and red, yet pale. 
[01:39:30]  My throat is killing me.  His throat hurts.  It's coming out his nose, and his eyes are all watery and teary.  You look like a basset hound.  You look like Hulk Hogan just walked away from you.  Hey, I got to ask Joe Rogan.  Are you impressed?  Yeah.  I mean, you've seen it all on Fear Factor.  Are you impressed with this or what?  I'm very impressed with the drinking of the puke.  Yeah.  That's unprecedented.  I've never seen anything like that.  I bow down.  I bow down to Pat Duffy.  All right, right on.  Pat Duffy.  Holy mother of Jesus. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, well.  And he didn't puke after he did it?  No.  Huh?  Can someone else do that for the money?  Well, we got another kid.  You guys want to do the same thing?  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  This guy's saying he can top what he did?  No, he said he can't top that.  Oh, you can't top that.  All right.  How about the guy with the beard, the Nirvana shirt?  We recognize him.  Can you top that?  Do you think you could drink that?  The beard is going to be a nice touch.  The beard.  Yeah.  It drooling down the beard.  Do you think you could...  It really looks like a fake beard, doesn't it?  Do you think you could top drinking...  Oh, he's stepping in the other guy's puke. 
[01:40:30]  He's in the puke now.  He's stepping in it.  Do you think you could top drinking that puke out of that beer pitcher?  Can I top it?  If you gargle it...  I have no idea.  Can you do it?  Who can gargle?  You know what we should do?  We should fill up two cups and see who could drink an entire cup.  One or the other.  A chugging contest?  Yeah.  You're out?  No, I got it.  I'm in.  Oh, my God.  He's an animal, Joe.  He's an animal. 
[01:41:00]  He's already done it.  You're, you know, a rookie.  I think we can get somebody to pee in a cup and drink out of it.  I think we can get somebody to drink somebody else's pee.  I could see that happening.  Yeah, I don't think that'll go through.  No, no.  I don't think that'll make it.  Yeah, no, no, no.  I don't see it happening with the air competition in this room.  Yeah, well, speaking of the air in this room.  I think pee is a step down from...  Enough!  I forgot the pee!  Stop!  None of it's making it.  None of it's making the radio.  Let's just say no fluid is as vile as vomit.  I don't think vomit's the worst you can get.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Okay.  There was a lot of dumping that had to be done there. 
[01:41:30]  Okay, we're back to the competition.  We're at to what?  51.  51.  51 now.  I'm seeing Jerry.  Jerry and Pat from Munaki.  Jerry's taking some deep breaths.  Yeah, I'm getting a little shaky.  You get a little shaky.  Pat from Munaki, how are you holding up?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  He's unshakable.  Pat is amazing.  An amazing athlete, I like to call him.  High-level athlete.  Yes.  Yeah.  Next year, we've got to do this.  Jerry's sweating.  We've got to do this in front of an audience, man.  You're looking a little pale, and I'm seeing like this almost spasmatic, like you're ready 
[01:42:00]  to puke.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Sergeant Magoo has poured out the big cups of puke.  Magoo is a good pourer.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Wow, I almost gagged.  It's like this.  Sweaty, it came very close.  It's like there's seaweed in there.  Look at Eric, you won't look up.  It looks like curdled vanilla pudding.  Good call, curdled vanilla pudding.  Yeah.  All right, here it is.  Two equal cups full of eggnog, Bobbit.  Jerry, don't look at this, bro.  Brother, don't look at this. 
[01:42:30]  I don't want you in this competition a little longer.  Holy Jesus.  All right, we've got the two guys still in the eggnog drinking contest officially.  We've got a small little clean cup.  We've got three, like, rings happening here.  It's like a circus.  We've got these two guys on the side.  They're going to drink a cup of eggnog, right?  Mm-hmm.  First one, eggnog puke.  Eggnog puke.  What's the deal?  The guy who finished first wins the money?  Yeah.  Jimmy, it's your thing.  I think so, yeah.  I don't care.  Whoever wants it now.  Whoever finishes it first.  Wait, whoever finishes first? 
[01:43:00]  No, no, no, because there might be more puke to be drunk.  I mean, we don't want anybody rushing.  Just enjoy it.  So what's the...  Who wins?  Who wins?  I don't know.  We need some rules.  We need some rules.  How about nobody?  Yeah, I don't think there's any...  Whoever turns this show off wins.  I think they ought to have a chug contest.  Whoever can chug it and hold it wins.  If they both do it, they've got to do another cup.  Oh, my God.  This is insane.  Another eggnog puke challenge. 
[01:43:30]  I say gargle.  I want to hear somebody gargle.  Jerry's rumbling.  Jerry.  I'll gargle it.  What's your name, by the way, Nirvana guy?  Drew.  Drew, what's up?  He looks like he's in a spin doctor.  Someone else's vomit.  That was a long time listener for some puke.  That was a good chance.  This is really tough.  I've never had this tough a time.  Nope.  Fan's unflappable, too.  Nothing bothers Fan.  He's just standing there, tenting his pants.  He doesn't care.  I've been fine with everything so far.  So far.  That is Paul R. Nelson shirt on.  Show off.  Fan is unflappably psychotic. 
[01:44:00]  So I say someone's got to gargle with that puke.  Why not?  I mean, it'd be cute.  Drew?  Jesus.  Oh, whoa.  He just gargled Sergeant Magoo's puke.  All right.  That got a little too close.  Did they make a mouthwash for that?  Yes, they did.  It's called a bullet.  By the way, HDNet is filming this whole thing.  Okay.  That got a little too late.  That splatter got a little too close. 
[01:44:30]  A little speck got on my chair.  This must be eliminated immediately, or I will leave the program.  Drew?  It tastes like vomit.  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like, Drew?  It tastes like eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  But there's clumps in it.  Dude, there's clumps.  It was warmed up in a man's stomach.  All right.  We got the intern with you.  Pat, Duffy.  Yep.  Hold on.  Jerry's raising his hand over there.  Jerry?  What's the matter, Jerry?  I thought it was for a second.  What?  I thought it was for a second.  All right. 
[01:45:00]  What shot are we up to?  We're getting close.  Dan, how many shots are we up to?  54.  All right.  The guys that are still in the competition, it's only two.  Pat from Minaki and Jerry.  They're about to do their 54th double shot.  Oh, they're going to do 55 right now.  All right.  Their 55th double shot of eggnog.  I think last year, Pat, did 71.  Yeah.  We're getting close to the record now.  Pat, how many more do you think you can do?  A few.  Uh-oh.  There goes Jerry.  Just put his down.  Pat's eating less because he's losing weight for his girl. 
[01:45:30]  So Pat's not in quite...  He's not in shape.  Not in this kind of shape.  He's not in shape.  He's becoming in better everyday shape.  Yeah.  You know.  I settled down, Pat.  Find yourself a nice girl and settle down.  Yeah.  Where's your girl there, Pat?  You don't know, do you?  Uh-oh.  I'm going to puke.  Oh, no.  Everyone.  This is the big guy, Jerry.  Here comes the bison.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's like he's sneezing through his mouth. 
[01:46:00]  Can't get it done.  It doesn't want to come out.  Did he technically puke?  Yep.  Yeah, we got a winner, actually.  Somebody, uh...  What a different sound. 
[01:46:30]  Alright, here it comes now.  Does this mean I won?  Magoo's holding the thing under.  Hold the pitch on it, Magoo.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Magoo, you got to catch some of it?  Yep.  Puke into the pitcher, sir.  Jerry is still over the barrel.  Not much has come out, considering how much he's got in him.  A lot of efforts.  It's still like a golf match.  Oh, there he goes. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, he's puking into the other thing of puke.  He's adding to Sergeant Magoo's pitcher.  Wow.  This is so heinous.  This is so bad.  You know what's funny?  The pitcher was so heinous that him puking didn't even faze me.  I don't know.  His puke is different.  My victory lap.  Yeah.  There's something about it.  It looks like white cheddar cheese puff.  Yeah.  It's thicker.  It's a cottage cheesy thing.  Yeah.  It's had time to really, like, solidify in his stomach. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  The water has gone through different pipes.  Yeah.  Left the solid.  Some body chemicals have been added.  Look at this.  Blur.  Ah!  Oh, God.  I like how he's enticing him with it.  Yeah.  The best part about this is Pat isn't even remotely fazed.  No.  How are you feeling, Pat?  Jerry.  I'm feeling pretty damn good.  Jerry?  How are you feeling?  I did it for you, Tonya.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Jerry is the runner-up in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[01:48:00]  Pat from Menaki gets his title back.  And not only that, he just finished the little shot.  He never had to.  Right.  He didn't have to finish it, but he just chugged down.  And he's refilling his cup.  Look at him go.  Hey, Pat, you going to go for the record or no?  Uh, hurry, one.  Did I mention I was diabetic?  Pat, do you have a grand finale in you? 
[01:48:30]  Hmm, funny you say grand.  Uh, wow.  Yeah, where's the money coming from?  Do we have to promote anybody or is it just cold, hard cash?  Ooh.  From just the radio station?  Free FM here in New York?  With Tonya.  Huh?  With that.  You going to take Tonya on a date?  Yeah.  Buy us something nice?  You drive Grandmaster Post somewhere.  Dude.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  Pat, what are you going to do?  You want to go for the record or no?  Sure.  What the hell?  All right.  Pat's going to go for the record. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Ah, let's say hi to Pete in the Bronx.  Pete, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I thought my window was open and I threw up all over the goddamn car.  Yeah, this is great, man.  All right, thanks.  It's one of those tough shows.  Larry on Long Island.  It really is tough.  Larry.  What's going on?  Hey.  Morning, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  I'm driving my truck on Sunrise Highway and I look to my left and I see this chick and  she's listening to the show.  She has to be.  It looks like she's gagging and making all these messed up faces. 
[01:49:30]  I look to my right and I can see this dude in a truck and I know he's listening and he's  laughing his ass off.  Classic radio.  Unbelievable.  I'm loving it.  It's been unbelievable today.  Let's go to Boston.  Zach, what's up?  Zach.  All right, I love Zach.  Let's go to Brandon in Cleveland.  Brandon.  Oh, that is, I was fine up until Jimmy started explaining it and the Viking swig, I had 
[01:50:00]  the burps and I had to run to the kitchen listening to you guys on direct TV.  And I say the money has to go.  I say that, would the young intern gargle with the other man's vomit?  And I say you get the money.  Absolutely.  This kid, nothing fazes him.  Nah, he's a tough competitor.  Just be careful you don't throw up on the walkway.  The only way to top this would be if someone put their head over the bucket with an open  mouth and let Pat from Wunaki throw up in their mouth.  Joey!  That's why Joe Rogan is here. 
[01:50:30]  That's the next level, people.  Rogan's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  Yeah, let's not make this happen next year.  Let's make it happen this year.  What do you say?  Well, Pat's going to...  See that?  That's all those years from all those great pitch meetings.  That's all the experience.  That's right.  It's a wonderful episode.  Human water fountain.  Well, Pat's going to have to get rid of what he's got in his belly because he's a  diabetic, so how many shots is Pat up to?  60.  60?  If we can get someone to just lean back, put the head over the bucket with an open mouth...  Who's going to lean back?  Can I catch it with this cup and drink? 
[01:51:00]  No, no, no, no.  Open mouth.  Well, we have to go to...  We can do a break, right?  Eric can hold you up.  Wow, we've got to take a break?  We want to take a break now.  Pat, do you think you can do that?  Open mouth?  You've got good aim?  Pat, can you hold out for five minutes before you puke?  Sure.  Sure.  This is going to be the most disgusting thing ever.  Like he's ever done this before.  Sure.  Pat, how close are you to puking?  I'm pretty good right now.  You can hold out for a few minutes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a pro.  All right, here's the deal.  Pat's going to go for the record.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:51:30]  I guess when we get back, it's the showstopper that Joe came up with.  Pat's going to have to get rid of this.  He won the eggnog drinking contest, and he's going to get rid of it as...  New intern dude is over the bucket, right?  Pat Duffy.  Other Pat.  Pat Duffy.  All right, cool.  We'll do that next.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the annual Eggnog Challenge on the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  We now return to the O.P. and Anthony Eggnog Challenge. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  We're back for the grand finale of the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  Wow.  We're just joining in.  Pat Fumunaki has won the Eggnog Drinking Contest, getting his title back.  He's won two out of the three competitions.  He's going for the record, which stands at 71 double shots of eggnog that he set last year.  And what else is going on, Anthony?  We got the new intern.  Yeah, the new intern. 
[01:52:30]  Pat.  Pat.  What's his last name?  Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Duffy, yeah.  Pat Duffy.  Soon to be legend.  And yeah, he is soon to be a legend in this competition because he has volunteered to let Pat Fumunaki,  who has had how many shots?  67.  67 shots.  He is four shots away from tying the Eggnog Drinking Contest record.  Earlier, Sergeant Magoo, as we know, puked into a beer pitcher, poured it into a bowl of Froot Loops and ate it, which is really disgusting. 
[01:53:00]  And so did, yeah.  Pat.  Pat, our new intern.  He did that.  Four step by step.  Ate some of the Froot Loops.  But now he has volunteered with a little bit of prodding to letting.  If he wants a job as an intern on the show, he's going to do this.  Yeah.  To letting Pat Fumunaki.  Right.  Unload his vomit into his mouth directly. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, because Pat has to get rid of this because he's a diabetic.  Yeah, he's a diabetic.  Now he's going to kneel.  I would say you should get into position shortly where you kneel on the tarpaulin and lean the head back over the garbage can.  Because you don't want to be balanced.  You don't want to fall back and break your neck.  Do we have a table?  I think.  What about that little stool there?  A good stool.  Good point.  Like in Max Hart.  Can he sit on that?  Let's get the stool.  Is that tall enough?  Yep.  Can he lean his throat back?  Hey, I've got to use that.  Is that stool good?  Put the stool against there.  See if he can sit on that and lean his head back like he's at the dentist. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, because it can't be the back of the head.  He's got to.  Yeah.  That could be a perfect size.  Okay, that works perfectly.  Yeah, like he's having his hair shampooed.  There you go.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Sam.  Did you shoot from that angle?  Yeah, shoot from another angle because if we don't get a view of this, I'm going to be pissed.  This is like watching Haley's Comet.  Oh, you missed it.  You're not going to see this again.  Sam, get in position.  Yeah.  HD net, get in position.  Pat from Menaki, how many shots have you done?  Oh, God. 
[01:54:30]  This is actually also like flash dance.  Yeah.  That scene where he pulls the little handle and the water goes all over him, but it certainly  won't be water.  Yeah, you get one later.  All right.  Wait, where are we at?  Where's Pat at?  Pat at 68.  You really think this is, you're really going to be able to do this one?  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, I'll do it.  You're going to let a dude throw up in your mouth.  Yeah.  Sam, how's that camera battery good?  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, we got like a three camera shoot going on.  By the way, this is called the Baby Bird, right?  Stan came up with the name? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, Stan came up with the name, the Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  Rogan, of course, that sick bastard came up with the idea.  Yeah.  And he's in position.  For the first time.  Pat's in position.  In radio history, you're about to listen to the Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  How about the first time in human history?  Which is, no, I think some fraternity did this somewhere.  That's true.  We're making German pornography.  Right.  This is, no, I think it was right the other way.  He's too high in the air now.  Yeah, don't be all silly. 
[01:55:30]  It's all right, because some's going to get on the tarp.  We have a tarp.  We have a tarp.  It's fine.  Pat, how many shots are you up to?  69.  69.  Pat is very close to the eggnog drinking contest record.  Okay, I'm feeling it, though.  You're feeling it?  Yeah.  Feeling that pressure.  Feeling a little nausea?  All right.  We got the new intern, Pat, in position, Pat Duffy.  This is going to be incredible.  And Danny, could you mic him from the other side?  Yeah.  Without getting Sam's way to, we got to film it properly.  Yeah.  We got to film it properly. 
[01:56:00]  Sam, you miss this, you die.  Yeah.  This is very important.  Don't go for art.  Go for documentary.  Yeah, exactly.  HD, you should get over there, too, just in case.  I think I'm close enough.  You're going to be all right?  Yeah, this guy, the cameraman's not into the whole puke thing, but he's filming it for  HD now.  But, you know, sometimes you got to, it's like a war correspondent.  I understand.  You don't want to see it, but you're there, and you have to document what happened.  All right, a lot of things going on.  Pat, what shot you got in your hand now?  71.  This is to tie the record right here, guys. 
[01:56:30]  How you doing?  He's taking his time.  It's rough, huh, Pat?  He's pulling this one over.  Pat, do it for love.  He's going to tell me when to go.  Oh, Pat's ready.  It's a shot.  All right, this ties the eggnog drinking contest record.  Pat has officially tied it.  He is one shot away from setting a brand new record here.  And, like a true champion, he's only in competition with himself.  Yeah, only with himself.  He could have stopped.  He won the competition.  He's feeling the pressure.  You could see it on his face.  He's not as confident as he was at the beginning of this. 
[01:57:00]  No.  He is just going for the record, though.  So he can pace himself.  He doesn't have to worry about losing.  And the loneliness of the champion left there standing alone.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Also, his belly is really bloated.  Yeah, it is really pushed out.  Because you've lost weight, and you've got a massive belly today.  It's like no filter Paul.  Now, I would suggest to Pat over here, the new intern, our new favorite intern, Pat, that don't move.  It's just going to make it worse. 
[01:57:30]  Close your eyes.  Your instinct is probably going to be to sit up quickly and get out of the way, but that'll just make it worse.  Just shut your eyes.  Let it happen.  Now, wait, wait.  Where's Pat Fumunaki going to stand?  Because you're way, you've got a whole bunch of people.  Yeah, Pat, what's your position going to be?  Right there.  Give him, like, a little hair rinse.  Do a dry run.  You've got to get his mouth.  No, the mouth, Pat.  Well, the whole head.  The whole head.  But aim for his mouth.  On the record.  On the record.  The record.  Pat has just set a new record of 72. 
[01:58:00]  72.  Fantastic.  He's just going to not be more relaxed.  He's like, like, his heart rate hasn't even gone up.  Pat, can we have, like, a dry run of what you're going to do?  Let's say you're ready to puke.  What are you going to do?  Brace yourself on the bucket, each hand, on the sides of the bucket.  And then right in his mouth.  In the mouth, Pat.  Don't worry about the bucket.  I mean, we've got the calm down.  It's called the baby bird.  It's not gay, Pat.  Pat.  You are the mommy bird coming back to feed the baby bird. 
[01:58:30]  Feed your young.  Your baby's hungry.  Pat, just destroy it.  God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's going to destroy him.  Please say that before you do it.  Pat, just destroy his face, man.  We don't care about the mess.  We'll clean up after.  Oh, no.  Tom's tight.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  73.  73.  Unbelievable.  73 double shots of eggnog from Pat Fuminaki.  This is the worst thing ever. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  This is really, really bad.  He's got that look on his face like those guys in the 80s that were about to fight Tyson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just that, oh.  Inevitable loss.  Joe Rogan playing Carolines all weekend long.  With the Amazing Racist opening up.  Pat, how are you?  Uh, it's getting real close.  All right.  It's getting real close.  Real close.  The suspense.  All the cameras out.  We've never had more people in the studio, by the way.  There's got to be about 30 people in here. 
[01:59:30]  At least.  And what he's doing is a DiMaggio-esque.  This is like the 56-game hitting streak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  73 shots.  This will never be broken.  Hey, someone is saying, please center the PalTalk camera.  We got it.  Uh, I got mine done.  All right.  No, no.  Mine's fine.  Uh-oh.  It's PalTalk 2.  All right.  That somebody's in the way of or something like that.  I guess it's the camera guy.  What shot is that?  The left.  74.  Oh, he's going for more.  He's going for 75.  Everyone's got to pretty much keep their position so the cameras and everybody can see. 
[02:00:00]  Buking all over the place.  75.  About every city in America.  And in Canada, thanks to XM.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 76.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  It's happening.  The baby bird is happening.  I can't speak.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[02:00:30]  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  No way.  Did that happen?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I almost wet myself.  Oh, my God.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard.  He ran into the corner.  Oh, yeah.  A thunderous round of applause.  Down goes Pat. 
[02:01:30]  Down goes Pat.  He's wearing puke blackface.  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  It's impossible to top that.  Trust me on that.  How can you top that?  Trust me on that.  How can that be top?  We are announcing our retirement right now because that is it.  How can that be top?  Wow.  Joe.  That can't be top.  That was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  That was insane.  Can you believe you were watching that as it was happening?  I cannot believe I saw that. 
[02:02:00]  Worst thing I've ever seen.  Holy.  Jimmy, what happened?  I was filming it on my camera for posterity.  It was like Zapruder.  And as I got a hit, the smell hit me and I almost threw up.  I mean the smell.  Dude.  That kid is interesting.  That's the best part when Pat, our new intern, turned his head sideways to get some of it  off of his face and Pat puked right in his ear.  You know, the best. 
[02:02:30]  What about when he opened his eyes and all of a sudden it was just these two clear dots  in the middle of this cake batter?  Listen.  He keeps going.  He keeps going.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, my God.  I'm watching it on Joe Rogan's camera phone.  Oh, my God.  I'm crying.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Look, look, look.  Here.  Hold on, Ann.  We got to do this because everyone's asking what the hell happened.  All they heard was the reaction.  So, Pat from Minaki.  What shot was that?  The 75th?  He did this 75th.  You got to get that.  Hold on. 
[02:03:00]  Let's do this, Ann.  Oh, the cleanup.  He did his 75th double shot of eggnog because people aren't sure exactly what happened.  Okay.  He immediately lost it.  We had Pat Duffy leaning over the bucket, and Pat just unloaded everything that was in  his stomach.  I've never seen anyone puke more volume in my life all over Pat Duffy's head.  He's still cleaning off his head.  It's pouring out of his hair still, the puke.  He just shook his head like he got out of a pool, you know, when you have stuff in your  ear.  There was no way to describe it as it was going on because the reaction in the studio 
[02:03:30]  was just amazing.  Oh, my God.  I defy that clip to not make the number one downloaded clip on YouTube.  We're going for number one download on YouTube.  What the hell are you going to watch that's better than that?  That clip will be up on YouTube, what, within a day?  I'm sending that to my website.  It's going to be at JoeRogan.net in about 10 seconds.  That's got to be.  Yeah.  That has to be online immediately.  It's going right now. 
[02:04:00]  It's going right now.  Brilliant.  Oh, look.  Joe is uploading it as we speak at.  Technology.  JoeRogan.net?  Yeah.  JoeRogan.net.  It'll be up in my phone camera slot section.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I was watching it like, and it was like, it was an out of body experience because I  was like, I know what it's like now to watch a murder happen.  Dude.  You're watching going, oh, my God, this isn't really happening.  All right.  It's Anthony.  Because people are like, all we heard was you guys screaming. 
[02:04:30]  You got to understand.  It was so unbelievable.  We stepped out of being radio hosts and just watched.  All right.  When I suggested it, I did not think he was going to take it out.  I'm telling you right now, Ann and I have been doing radio for 12 plus years.  That is the greatest moment that we've seen in studio.  We've seen it all.  And we've seen it all.  That he was leaning back, his head over the garbage pail, sitting on a stool like you  would getting your hair shampooed at a salon.  Oh, God.  That's the exact stance he had.  Pat was on the other side where the sink would be, where the faucets would be. 
[02:05:00]  The mama bird side.  Yeah, the mama bird side.  Pat, the intern, mouth opened, and then Pat from Unaki just let loose a virtual waterfall.  Have you ever seen anyone puke more volume?  No, no.  I can't even describe how much came out of him.  It's uploaded.  It's at JoeRogan.net now.  There's a little section in the upper left-hand corner that says latest camera phone shot.  It'll be a video.  It'll be on Text America.  Good luck.  You can find it on JoeRogan.net. 
[02:05:30]  Good luck.  You just crashed your site, I'm sure.  I don't care.  Wow.  I got it on my cell phone.  I don't care.  I can't believe I saw that.  Steve, get that video up on OPNF.net.  And it kept happening and happening.  It wasn't like it happened and then it was done.  Right.  It went on and on and on.  On and on.  On and on.  On and on.  And the volume, yeah.  It was more each time until he was completely covered.  It looked like that.  The mama bird.  God.  Look at this disgusting.  It stinks.  Pat was standing there and he would just open his mouth and it shot out of it. 
[02:06:00]  It almost looked like fake puke.  Like it was being done with a hose.  Like she says, when she's open her mouth and puke, shot out.  And like Joe said, simple as this.  We just raised a bar.  I guarantee that is the greatest moment in radio history right there as far as just over-the-top  stuff.  Oh my God.  I guarantee.  When you see this video on YouTube and opianthony.com, you're not going to believe it.  I'm uploading a second video.  I got two videos.  He never puked himself.  Yeah.  You didn't puke.  Right, Pat? 
[02:06:30]  You are a trooper.  Pat Duffy.  He's our new.  You're saving it for the walkover.  He's our new intern.  That dude is a savage.  Give him the money.  It's not much money, but give it to him.  That's his money.  Oh, yeah.  Here, Pat.  Now that's a way to apply for a goddamn job.  Absolutely.  Oh my God.  You're hired.  He deserves health insurance after that one.  Yeah.  Dental even.  What are your references?  He puts his head back and opens his mouth.  Wow.  A little thing called the baby bird.  Yeah.  You ever hear of the baby bird?  Me. 
[02:07:00]  Greatest moment in radio history.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe, you know football?  He knows.  You don't know football?  I got to get these.  Let Pat do your radio picks.  Let this new boy, Pat Duffy, do your picks.  Yeah, I got to do my football picks for this week.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  That's 1-888-GET-DISH.  Dish Network.  Oh, just nothing but total respect.  How about we do this as a group?  Jets, Packers.  What do we think?  Jets.  Yeah, let's go Jets on that.  All right.  Jaguars, Dolphins. 
[02:07:30]  Got to be the Dolphins.  Yes, Dolphins are playing at home.  Got to go Dolphins.  Maybe, but the Jaguars.  We got the Falcons and the Redskins.  That's a toughie.  Redskins at home?  I hate the Redskins.  Thank you.  Falcons.  Falcons.  A better team.  Michael Vick.  All right, we'll go.  But then again, he's giving his finger to his own fans.  I love him.  All right, let's go Falcons.  So, so far, I got the Jets, the Dolphins, the Falcons.  Here's the biggie this week.  Cowboys, Giants.  It's going to be Cowboys.  Cowboys on our roll.  He's going to run through that stupid Giant defense.  And then finally, the Texans and the Raiders. 
[02:08:00]  Definitely Denver.  It looks like he got some...  Yeah, I like Denver, too.  Denver?  Houston or Oakland?  Angrily.  I say who cares, but...  I'll go with...  I'll go...  Take Oakland.  Yeah, take Oakland.  Oakland at home.  Oakland at home, all right?  Wow, does it smell over there, Steve?  Oh, it's...  Football.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Steve has puke on him.  Puke on the wires.  There's puke all over me. 
[02:08:30]  It really is.  Is it smelling, Bandhock?  Yeah, it's very smell.  People are calling it puke-hockey.  Hey, we're going to walk over to XM, and we have some...  The boys will be drinking some eggnog on the way.  Yeah.  This young go-getter, Pat Duffy, hopefully won't throw up on the walkover, because we'd  hate to see that on 57th Street, because that would look really awful.  Yeah.  And we'll be filming.  Well, I'm now looking at the text that was coming out of Pal Talk, because the people  were watching it on the cameras, and I've never seen so many no's being written ever. 
[02:09:00]  People are just disgusted.  Other people just throwing in random letters, like they just slammed their keyboard and hit  send.  You know...  They were stunned.  Dude, for the first time, I think the reaction said it all.  I mean, we had over 30, maybe 40 people in studio just losing their minds.  Jimmy, like, I didn't even know where you went.  I stood on the couch and was filming with my own camera.  I fell on the floor.  I was laughing so freaking hard.  I was crying. 
[02:09:30]  I thought I was going to wet myself.  No one else was puking.  I got right next to it to get it on my camera phone.  I didn't even throw up.  I was so transfixed by the moment.  I couldn't believe it was actually happening.  It was like an alien abduction.  You are a trooper, man.  And the amount of applause was incredible.  Yeah.  It's called the baby bird.  Thank you, Stan, for naming that fine little stunt.  And Rogan for thinking it.  Yeah.  And Pat for being Pat.  And other Pats for being Pat.  We have two Pats.  Yeah, we got to...  I've got to hear that again when we get over there.  Yeah, we will.  I've got to hear the clip.  Listen, let's get out of here. 
[02:10:00]  We got to get out of here early because they got to clean up.  Yeah, they got to clean up.  All right.  Joe Rogan at Caroline's all weekend long.  I'm telling you right now, Joe Rogan's comedy is amazing.  Make sure you check him out at Caroline's if you're in the area.  Yeah, and you got the amazing racist with you, right?  212-757-4100.  You're there tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday, right?  Yeah.  How many shows?  Two, two, and one?  Two, two, and one, yeah.  Rogan will sell out, you idiots.  So call.  Bill Burr, anything?  What do I got?  South Beach for New Year's.  All right, very good. 
[02:10:30]  And we'll continue over at XM Monday and Tuesday, broadcasting live from West Palm Beach, Florida.  We're leaving for West Palm right after the second half of the show on XM today.  West Palm Beach.  That's where I'm going to be.  Oh, right on.  And we'll be at the bake sale that they're doing down there tomorrow.  It's an all-day concert festival or whatever.  Hurry up.  Get me out of here.  Yeah, all right.  We got to go, guys.  Thank you so much.  Don't forget to check out the videos on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search engine.  That should happen within the next day or so. 
[02:11:00]  And also opieandanthony.com.  A little secret, because when Sam throws these videos up on YouTube, you have to wait in the search engine for about 24 hours.  Yeah.  His account is OAVideos.  OAVideos.  You can get a sneak peek very early on.  OAVideos.  All right.  That's for the tech people out there.  They'll figure it out.  Hey, guys.  Thank you so much.  We'll see you when we broadcast live from West Palm Beach Monday and Tuesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show is headed to Florida, and you're not. 
[02:11:30]  Tune in to The Opie and Anthony Show Monday and Tuesday morning, December 4th and 5th,  as we broadcast from the Buzz 103 FM studios in West Palm without you.  If you're in the West Palm area, feel free to stop by and watch the show from a safe distance.  That's Monday and Tuesday morning, December 4th and 5th, live from West Palm. 
[02:12:00]  Details on opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Wow.  I'm awestruck at what I just saw.  I'm happy to breathe fresh air.  And Bill pointed out there are three buses across the street, like, spewing exhaust. 
[02:12:30]  And to me, it's fresh air because it stunk so fucking bad in that studio.  This is going to be the video that everyone talks about as far as the Opie and Anthony Show goes.  We've made some great videos lately.  This one is going to be—it might beat Bill Burr's video, by the way, is the top Opie and Anthony video on YouTube.  You're in trouble, Bill.  Oh, yeah.  You're in trouble.  You're going to be going down on this one.  And there's no reason why mine should not be number two by 930. 
[02:13:00]  I can't even explain it.  Baby Bird.  It's called the Baby Bird.  Joe Rogan came up with it, then named it, and it wasn't disappointing.  We had—Sam's camera work was unbelievable.  I saw it.  I can't—it's amazing how much came out of Pat from Inaki.  That's the first thing that comes to mind.  It was like a pail.  A pail.  There you go.  Every time he puked.  Every time, right.  How Pat, our new intern, Pat Duffy—  Pat Duffy.  How he took it.  Just laid there and just took it. 
[02:13:30]  Like a man.  Like a man.  Like a man takes you.  He turned his head at one point.  No.  Oh, like Pat Duffy.  Like Pat Duffy.  And he was going, trying to get it out of his mouth and nose and eyes.  Yeah.  And as his head was turned, Pat laid a volley of puke on the side of his head.  Yeah.  That just covered his entire head.  They're both named Pat.  It sounds so bad.  Pat, so you've got to go Mama Bird and Baby Bird.  Mama Bird and Baby Bird.  Right.  By the way, usually we have security walking us to XM, and of course we do today. 
[02:14:00]  They have to walk with Sam and that camera.  Very valuable tape in there.  Somebody walk with Sam today.  He needs to handcuff that to his wrist, right?  Yeah, don't get it, man.  Would you be mad at him if he dropped it in the tape?  Oh, God.  In a puddle?  No.  That would be our luck, to be honest with you.  Sam, what are you waiting for?  Get to XM.  Get that online.  Be careful with the camera.  Camera.  Camera.  Why don't you put that tape and take it out?  Sam's a good one.  He took it out already.  He doesn't have it anymore.  All right.  Kids all cock.  All right.  Want to start the walk? 
[02:14:30]  We've got a huge crowd here today.  Everyone say hi.  Hi.  Oh, yeah.  Very, very nice crowd.  I think they're seeing us off.  They kind of come out when we're hitting the road.  Yep.  Or they think we're about to be fired.  Yeah.  True.  Hitting West Palm Beach after the show today.  Yeah, Tom Chiosano looked none too happy about the festivities.  I talked to him after the show.  I've got to be honest.  He was cool.  Was he?  He was pretty cool about it.  A little worried about how we left the studio, but it was not our problem.  It was a fucking mess.  Oh, yeah.  He's the one who's got to listen to the complaining. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Those poor bastards who've got to come in next.  JV and Elvis are going to go in there and just be like a little pissed off at the smell.  Dude, yeah, how awful it is.  We got used to it because it happened slowly.  Right.  Can you imagine walking into that and just smelling that?  It was worse down the hall because of the fan.  Yeah.  You know, I've got to say it.  The eggnog drinking contest gets better and better every year.  Every year.  I don't know how we're going to top it.  This was by far.  Oh, screw Andrew today.  Go fuck yourself.  Andrew, how are you?  How are you?  How are you doing?  Treat yourself. 
[02:15:30]  Gilligan.  We'll see you at the homeless shopping spree.  He does have hair like Gilligan.  He does.  Gilligan.  And the same living situation.  Dude.  He needs a little fake palm tree out there.  Hey, we should get that for him.  So many highlights.  So many highlights.  The first puke, that gurgling sound.  And that, again, was Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  His name is Pat Duffy.  Is anyone going to puke on the walkover?  I would love to see the reaction of people if we get some.  Hey, does anybody have to puke?  Anybody sick? 
[02:16:00]  No, they're all kind of dry.  Fuck, I would have loved to have seen somebody drink some eggnog.  You guys had a Congressional Medal of Honor.  I know.  He should get it.  He really should.  So we had Pat Duffy that star of the festivities as far as the highlights go.  And then, I mean, Sergeant Magoo.  You almost forget what Sergeant Magoo did in this competition today.  Just amazing, amazing stuff with the Froot Loops and the puke.  It was a total team effort.  It was incredible.  You've got to come up with a new, the Pat Duffy Award. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Joe, your thoughts once again.  Huh?  Your thoughts on what you just saw.  I'm blown away.  I feel like I just saw, like, someone do something that's impossible.  I feel like I saw someone fly through the air, breathe underwater.  Someone inventing a new kind of music.  And Joe Rogan, remember, this guy's seen a lot of really heinous shit.  That was way past anything I ever saw in Chris Factor.  Wait, that was in another dimension.  Yep. 
[02:17:00]  Another dimension.  You just saw the Beatles.  Yeah.  Beat that.  The Beatles of Pukes.  That was the first talkie.  You just saw the first talkie.  Amazing.  All right, making our way back.  Bye, Patty.  Oh, Patty's there.  The only thing that would be better is if we dipped her in that can.  Oh, that would be cool.  Puke covered, Patty.  Just head first right into the garbage field.  I missed it.  A tail full of puke.  Oh, my God.  Let me, let me, can I get through here, Joe?  Somebody smells of puke. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I wonder why.  There's probably four of us that don't.  God, we got a lot of people out here today.  Huge crowd doing the walkover.  All right.  Which way do you want to go?  Well, that's flashing.  We'll go straight.  We'll go straight today.  We have Sonny Ferrelli out here and Flea.  Yeah, a lot of the regulars.  The whole dirty crew.  General Bam's out here looking around.  Bus stops.  Happy typing girls out here.  Son of a.  Oh, thank you.  I love the old cats. 
[02:18:00]  Huh?  Waiting for the light to change.  All right, we're good.  Waiting for the bus to get out of the way.  Yeah, everybody does smell like puke out here.  We've got to get on the elevator with the puke guy.  We have to get on.  I want to see people's reaction when he gets on the elevator.  Oh, yeah.  Puke guy.  Just reeking.  He has to be on the elevator.  We have to puff it out.  Reeking as puke.  Oh.  By the way, the video will be up on YouTube.  A little side door action because stupid YouTube.  You've got to wait like a day for the video to be available.  Sam's account is OAVideos.  I was wondering what the smell was.  OAVideos. 
[02:18:30]  It's the picture.  We've got to get.  Where's the picture?  It's hanging off of Sergeant Magoo's back pocket.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There we go.  We've got to.  Yeah, I want to see the faces when Pat Duffy gets in the elevator.  And just reeks.  Oh, look at the dogs.  Kick them.  He's going to cook them.  Fucking rotten Asian.  Wow.  What a day.  Jesus, man.  That, I don't know how you top something like that.  Next year, what are we going to do? 
[02:19:00]  Next year, we've got to bring the eggnog drinking contest to the public.  We have to do that.  Imagine the baby bird in front of a couple of thousand people.  By the way, Ant, good description when you were talking about Flashdance.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how he was laying.  If you know that old movie with the water coming down, cascading, it was that much pew.  That's what it looked like.  It was that much pew.  Flashdance, yeah.  The water scene.  Oh, what a smart outfit.  She looks like a fat white tiger.  I wish a lion would come out and bite her neck. 
[02:19:30]  A zebra.  Exactly.  A fat zebra.  Oh, that was the fucking worst.  A white and black striped hat and coat.  Awful ghetto.  She's dressed like she was on the Flintstones.  All right, what are we going to do?  How are we going to get all these people up today?  Well, huh?  I'll organize.  That's Kenny.  We realize they're bringing the smell of puke with them.  All right, everyone.  We're on that out there.  Hold on.  Everyone listen up. 
[02:20:00]  Kenny.  Kenny, your speech.  Yeah.  Listen, people.  Pay attention.  If you want to come upstairs, I will discreetly pick some of you to come upstairs and watch  the Opie and Anthony radio show on XM Satellite Radio.  The greatest radio show.  That's correct.  The greatest radio show of all time.  Thank you.  All right.  Kenny, we'll take care of you guys.  Thank you.  Do you want to put favors there?  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:20:30]  I will pick you discreetly.  Discreetly?  I don't think that's the word he was looking for.  All right.  Heading toward the elevators.  We'll see you guys upstairs.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[02:21:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Opie.  I could have been a model.  Anthony. 
[02:21:30]  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  guitar solo 
[02:22:00]  guitar solo 
[02:22:30]  Unbelievable.  Has anyone seen Pat yet?  No.  Usually he spends about an hour in the bathroom after the eggnog drinking contest shitting and puking. 
[02:23:00]  Unbelievable is all I can say.  You know, if Pat wins it again next year, that's a dynasty.  It's a dynasty.  Well, he's won two out of the three.  Two out of the three.  And the new record is 75, I guess.  Set the record.  There were so many highlights.  We were remembering all the highlights in the elevator.  We almost forgot that E-Rock was puking through the whole thing.  And he wasn't even in the competition. 
[02:23:30]  That was so much fun.  That was unbelievable.  The chugging of the puke.  Just Niagara Falls.  It was like standing under a waterfall of eggnog puke.  Sam is already in front of a computer working on the video.  Yeah.  JoeRogan.net, it's all uploaded to the front page now.  It's on the front page now.  Two videos from my camera phone.  Let's say hi to Lucas in Arizona.  Lucas.  Hey.  What's up, ONA? 
[02:24:00]  Hey.  Well, thank you guys for giving me the best birthday present ever.  Yeah.  Oh, you like that, huh?  Yeah.  Love the puking.  Love the puking.  Thank you, sir.  And our, you know, they're never satisfied.  Rogan never choked out flea.  We forgot all about flea.  Just relax.  How do you top that?  If Rogan puts puke on his cock and chokes flea with it, there's no way to follow that.  I have to fuck flea in the ass with puke on my dick while I choked him unconscious.  I like it.  While he threw up into Pat's mouth.  Might have to come back next year. 
[02:24:30]  In front of an audience.  Next year, we do it in front of an audience.  Well, we had an audience today.  We had about 40 people.  We're talking in front of 1,000 people.  That was repugnant.  I've got to hear it because I was in the moment.  It's very hard to, like, really sort it out.  I want to hear it so I know what the listeners heard.  Yeah, well, do we have the audio ready to go?  Not yet, Matt.  Not yet?  And by the way, Abbott, we have to get a couple of the interns in here.  Something's going on.  Yeah, we'll figure all that out. 
[02:25:00]  We're a problem, bro.  Are they jealous of the new star?  I don't know.  Maybe that's if they're feeling the pressure.  There's no way you're going to top that guy.  No.  That guy, he didn't even throw up.  He had his mouth wide open.  He turned to the side, then Pat threw up in his ear.  And then all over his head and face and chest.  And you were saying he opened his eyes.  It was like a raccoon.  Yeah, he looked like a raccoon.  And he's, like, spitting.  And bubbles were coming out of his nose.  I just never thought anybody was going to do it.  No. 
[02:25:30]  Someone is going to think that's a fake video.  Just how his mouth was so wide open.  It was like a broken fire hydrant.  Where do you go mentally to block all that out and just be like, okay, it's just warm, liquid?  That Pat Duffy is a sick fuck.  That kid is completely out of control.  That's your guy.  There's not a lot of guys like that.  That's a rare find.  I'll tell you, an intern like that comes around once every 20 years.  Right.  It's like the Muhammad Ali of interns. 
[02:26:00]  That's the guy you want on your team.  Jimmy Hendricks.  He's a Cassius Duffy.  We all know his name.  So, his name is Pat Duffy.  Dom, dom.  I'm trying to think.  Rogan's site.  Just don't even bother going there.  Is it crap?  I can't even.  It won't load.  You're a smart man, Joe Rogan.  You're a smart man.  I'm trying to think.  Other things we've done that comes close to that.  And we've seen it all. 
[02:26:30]  We've had blind guys boxing.  That was where a guy popped out his eyes and was boxing.  Cigarette smoking out of the pussy.  Out of the pussy.  Just trying to make a cell phone call with a girl with a phone up her pussy.  Yeah.  To see if we got reception.  Of course, the 55-gallon drum challenges.  55-gallon drum.  That's going to be a lot.  Shooting a bottle rocket out of her pussy.  Shooting a bottle rocket out of your pussy.  That's still.  This might go right to the top.  Yeah.  I think it was.  I think it was. 
[02:27:00]  I've never heard of anything that crazy.  A lot of those videos are up on YouTube, by the way.  Is anybody, I mean, who's going to rip that off?  Is somebody going to rip that off?  Is some hack in Kansas City going to rip that off?  How can you?  Where are you going to find someone that's going to agree to that?  That was like the stars aligned perfectly.  We were having the competition.  We had a guy in there that was willing to do this.  That'd be funny if they tried to rip Baby Bird.  The little seagull.  We came up with it first.  Yeah, the little seagull.  The penguin.  The baby bird.  Dude, that video is going to be just viewed like. 
[02:27:30]  It better be, or else YouTube is.  Stupid.  Phony.  Even if you get someone to agree to it, you also have to have someone there who's willing  to projectile vomit.  Vomit.  You have to have him had enough in him that he can vomit that much.  75 shots.  Everyone has to drink.  75 shots.  Double shots.  Double shots of eggnog.  Yeah.  And every year we try to do the math, and every year we fail.  So we figured out 75 double shots.  How much eggnog is that?  It's got to be a gallon.  Maybe a gallon.  He said that you can't drink a gallon of milk.  He told me that it was impossible to drink a gallon of milk. 
[02:28:00]  We've done it.  Really?  Yeah.  In an hour?  That was a perfect storm.  I thought it was impossible.  I've heard it's impossible.  We've heard the same thing, but we had a guy do it to get into this contest.  Pat from Wunaki.  Well, then he puked.  Champion.  He's a champion.  A true champion.  Where is Pat from Wunaki?  He's still puking and shitting somewhere.  That's what he does after the competition.  He smells like such disgusting.  He's icing down his larynx.  Where's Tanya?  You think they're going to make out after this?  I love you.  Here.  Can I puke on you?  Some people are saying they've seen the video already.  Probably off Joe Rogan's site. 
[02:28:30]  And they're saying, best video ever.  He's going up to the victors, go to the spoils.  Trying to fill her up.  As his pants are down around his fucking nine-toed feet.  And he's shitting in the fucking 3FM bathroom.  Puking sloth.  Yeah.  Let's go to Corey in Montana.  Corey.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I just thought you might owe me breakfast because I left mine laying on Highway 261.  Yeah, I think a lot of people are puking.  That was coming in like crazy. 
[02:29:00]  People puking all over the place.  What do you think we got?  How many people puking?  Maybe 100,000?  Oh, and when you started describing that.  I bet you got 100,000 people puking.  Puking.  Puking.  When you started describing that viscous-y, stringy stuff out of Magoo's picture, I lost it.  That's when I never like get nauseous at these things.  I've seen them.  You know, I consider myself a war veteran of this kind of thing.  Yeah, absolutely.  Been in it.  Been in the trenches.  But I got that tinge of a choking feeling in my throat at one point when Magoo was pouring 
[02:29:30]  the beer pitcher of his own vomit on top of his Froot Loops.  And it made this stringy, like white and yellow goop.  And then a big blob just went bloop and fell out in it.  It almost, I got like a tinge of tightening up in the throat.  That was the most disgusting thing.  Like the puking on the head was just like.  It was so amazing.  It went beyond gross.  Yeah, it was so amazing. 
[02:30:00]  You didn't have time to think about it on the sense of it being gross.  You just were amazed you were watching it.  Yeah.  It was one of those things that, like, you know.  Has that ever happened before?  The moon landing.  It was like watching the moon landing.  I can't even talk, dude.  I am ruined.  Dumbfounded.  I have nothing to say.  You had to remove yourself from the situation.  No, no.  I was on the red couch standing there filming it.  Yeah.  With my camera.  It was just.  When the smell hit me, I had to, I literally almost just vomited involuntarily. 
[02:30:30]  That smell.  Now that would have been a real topper if Jimmy Norton himself would have puke.  I was very close to it, but I hate puke.  What was amazing was how it escalated slowly.  Yeah.  Like, first, Magoo threatened to eat his own puke.  Yeah.  And everybody's like, okay, is this guy really going to eat his own puke?  And then he throws up into the pitcher.  Oh, Jesus.  Now he's pouring the pitcher into the, you know, the Froot Loops in there.  Now he's eating it.  Now fucking Pat is eating his puke.  You got to be shitting me.  And then the other guy jumps in like he's going to be the fucking champ.  And then they start gargling. 
[02:31:00]  I mean, it just kept going.  Oh, I forgot about it.  The Viking chug.  The Viking chug happened.  The Viking chug.  And it wasn't even his puke.  It was someone else's puke.  Oh, it was fucking insane.  That was another Pat Duffy.  His trifecta.  He's an animal.  Pat Duffy's a savage.  Pat Duffy.  Let me ask you, Pat Duffy, just nod.  Keep it on the mic on you.  Do you have a fetish for girls' puke or no?  No, you don't.  Okay.  Because some guys like that shit.  It's called Roman showers.  There are guys that get off on it and pay hookers to do it.  Yeah, let's bring Pat Duffy in here.  Pat Duffy.  No, let's talk to Pat Duffy out there.  Who would ever thought that the Sgt. Magoo fruit loop trick was nothing? 
[02:31:30]  We're going to stand over there.  Turns out to be nothing.  No, you know.  No, you stay over there is where people stay.  It was an appetizer.  You fucking look like you're ready to raise a barn.  You know what's funny?  That you brought that up?  The Roman showers.  That means somebody's going to watch that thing tonight and jerk off to it.  You have no idea.  It's already happened.  If it's on my website, someone already has got their cock out right now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're fucking puking.  Yeah, you fucking puking.  Fucking puking.  Fucking puking in his fucking mouth, you fucking whore.  I've seen all that shit, but you finally made a fucking cape out of it.  And if someone hasn't, just because we talked about it, someone's got their dick out right 
[02:32:00]  now.  Fuck yeah!  Why didn't I pick that?  Those are the clothes you were wearing.  Yeah.  So, well, different shirt.  I had to change my shirt.  How did you clean...  Ope told me to take this one off, so I had my undershirt on.  How about the shorts?  Well, the shorts are the same.  I still got to puke all over them.  Smell the less.  Magooze poured water down my back, and now it's like I got all...  Wet nuts.  And down your butt crack, you got puked.  But honestly, he doesn't look bad considering what he went through.  Well, they handed me like a pile of paper towels.  And then I saw him pouring water over your head, giving you a little shower over the puke 
[02:32:30]  bucket.  What were you thinking as it's hitting your mouth?  Yeah.  I felt like my ex on a Saturday night.  I always wanted to say that.  Sorry.  That's all right.  Hey, first one.  First of many, my friend.  So, dude, this is when we tear the legend down.  Right.  You got to knock him off his pedestal a little bit.  Please don't.  Literally, this will be my heroes crushing me.  Please don't.  No, we love you, Pat.  No, what are you kidding?  After what you did?  So, Pat Duffy, you are...  As it's coming, what are you thinking?  Just, I was just waiting for it and I knew it was going to be disgusting. 
[02:33:00]  But I knew it was going to be mostly eggnog, so it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  How bad was the smell?  Disgusting.  I didn't think the smell was going to be as bad as it is.  See that?  You know why?  It wasn't only eggnog.  Exactly.  Where did you go, like, mentally?  What did you tell yourself?  It's a happy place.  Vietnam.  It's a happy place.  Yeah.  You saw choppers and fucking Agent Orange.  Yeah.  Napalm.  Take the pain.  Oh, Pat Duffy.  Why did you decide to open your eyes?  Think of an Alzar Cowie beheading.  Just see if I could see through it.  Yeah, he did open his eyes.  I had a bad decision.  See my ears still?  Everything's kind of muffled still. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, my God.  He's got a puke in his ears.  How are you going to get that out?  You put a Q-tip?  Q-tip, yes.  I blew my nose.  It was all eggnog.  Wow, you really do stink, too.  I know.  I can smell it now.  Don't make him feel bad.  He's a good boy.  Thank you.  We love Pat Duffy.  Can we re-hear it?  Danny's pulling it right now.  Yeah, I got to hear that.  Are we going on CD or something?  Make it easy that way?  All right.  We're going to replay it in a second here.  Again, trying to load Rogan's page.  That's awesome. 
[02:34:00]  Pat's dad?  We got to get him headphones.  I can't hear it.  We got to get him guest headphones that we never use.  Yeah, get him the headphones.  He has puke in his ear.  Oh, God, that smell is back.  We need some sort of isolation booth for these moments.  Hang on, Kate.  Oh, jeez.  That's my dad.  Hey, there's your dad.  I'm on the phone.  Hey, Pat's dad.  O.B., what's happening, bro?  What's up?  What's your name?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  How are you?  What do you think of your son today?  $35,000 of education money.  This is it.  You better give him a job. 
[02:34:30]  Hey, you know how hard it is to get an internship on our show, and he just got it?  Thank you.  Apparently, I'm very good.  I turned him on to your show way back when, the N.E.W. days.  Back in 99.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  I emailed you a bunch of months ago and told you all about it.  Your son is a champion.  Yeah, he's a champion, and he's got an internship because of what he did today.  Rare stock.  Actually, someone we hired to be an intern is now fired.  It has to be you.  We got to make a spot for Pat Duffy.  That's great.  It's like when Michael Jordan came into the league and just showed everybody the next level.  Right, right. 
[02:35:00]  Yep.  Yeah, it's like, he's like, just, there's no one.  No one.  No one's going to come close to that.  You'd have to shit in his mouth.  There's only, that's, you'd have to force diarrhea.  That's next year.  You're going to have to force diarrhea.  Someone's going to have to take massive fucking laxatives, squeeze their asshole shut, and  someone's going to have to lean their head over a toilet bowl and shit in someone's mouth.  That's the only way we're going to beat this.  Just explode shit all over someone's mouth.  It's the only way it can be beaten.  I've gotten to Rogan's site.  I am watching some of the video from his phone. 
[02:35:30]  Oh my God.  Yeah, this is just, you got him in like mid puke there to start.  But look, it just cascades out of his mouth.  All over his face.  Just the sheer volume.  Oh, look at that.  There's no way a man can puke that much.  And his face is covered.  And it went on and on.  Dude, that's pretty gross.  Yeah, I thought it was over at one point, but it wasn't at all. 
[02:36:00]  That's when you took the ear shut.  Yeah, that was the ear shut.  Anthony, Sam is working on our crystal clear video.  A little competition.  A little competition.  That's amazing.  Our version will be crystal clear.  Oh, I saw.  Your version is phenomenal because he turns his head.  To the side, like to try to spit out.  And then Pat throws up in his ear.  Like right in his ear.  Yeah, oh, I got to see it.  Hey, Pat's dad, anything else?  Nah, just telling him, I said, McGillicott, nice job.  I'll catch you later. 
[02:36:30]  I got to make a delivery.  I'll see you at pizza night, Duff.  All right, any plugs out there?  You want to plug anything there, Mike?  Nah, I'm driving an Exxon truck.  How's that?  All right, you're all good.  All right.  So you and your dad get along.  All right, thank you, Mike.  Take care about it.  You and your dad get along good, right?  Oh, yeah, he's really the reason that I'm into radio and everything.  They're like friends.  He and his dad are like fucking buddies.  He's awesome, Duff.  Yeah.  I really rip him apart like all the time.  Pizza nights are ridiculous.  We have pizza every Friday night.  The whole time I just rip my dad apart.  Yeah.  That's good.  He's good like you.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's sweet. 
[02:37:00]  All right, we're just waiting for the audio.  Danny's going to bring it in any second.  So I got to hear that again.  I'm actually hungry.  Smelling in here.  Yeah, I got some food coming, man.  Yeah, me too.  George in Jersey, what's up?  Dude, that had to have been the best fucking radio I've ever heard in my life.  Crazy, crazy.  Hey, listen.  Is Rogan still over there?  I was wondering if he could send me that pic on his phone, man.  Yeah, Rogan will just send you something.  What are you doing?  If you go to JoeRogan.net, it's up on the front page if you can get it to load. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I don't have a computer, man.  That's why.  Oh, well, you're fucked.  You there.  Well, dude, give me a number off the air, and Rogan will give you his number, and you  guys can send videos back and forth.  But you do it off the air, because that's the way Joe operates.  All right, all right.  Hold on.  No computer.  Did Joe send me a laptop?  Find a Nickelodeon of it.  Maybe you can come over and teach your karate too in a room.  You both dress like Roman Bruckle wrestlers.  JV and Elvis in a studio stinks.  Yeah, Carl in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  I had to, unfortunately, tune out of your walkover, because I wanted to hear those assholes start  their show.  And they said they needed a fan, because it sounds like lemon pledge and so up. 
[02:38:00]  And they must have, like, an intern or some producer or some shit in the background,  and he was just throwing up all over the place.  They just couldn't take it.  They were really, really good.  The puking is continuing over at the other studio.  The puking is so contagious.  Yo, I'm not even joking, man.  It's like you can hear the guy in the background throwing up.  They were just pissed.  They had a couple of chicks that worked for him too, I think, and that's the word,  because girls don't react well to vomit.  No, they don't.  I wonder what the real numbers of people throwing up listening were. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, Rogan.  It's like 100,000 people.  Joe.  What's up, dude?  I love you, Joe.  You're the man.  Thank you, man.  You know, Owen had a man too, but, you know, just got to throw some props out.  Joe came up with the idea.  Yeah.  Joe, nobody, no one in their right mind would have thought that was possible, so why bring  it up?  Got to tell you.  And Joe Rogan.  Yep.  Hey, puking his mouth.  Okay?  Did he just say okay?  Why?  I know.  I thought Joe was just being ridiculous.  Yeah.  Just going, hey, wouldn't this be wacky? 
[02:39:00]  And Ant and I are great at talking people into doing stuff, so I'm thinking, all right,  great idea.  This might take an hour, but I think we can get it done.  It was like immediate.  I had faith in that kid.  I'm immediate.  Thank you.  I had faith in that Pat Duffy.  There's something about that kid.  The look in his eyes, I'm like, this kid can do it.  He's unflappable.  There is a still picture on a thread on Wackbag that says, congratulations, Pat from  Munaki.  It says, congratulations to Pat from Munaki on his first place win.  We knew you could do it.  And then there is a still photo of, I cannot even describe the amount of puke coming out 
[02:39:30]  of his face.  They're going to say that's fake.  It looks like it was done at Lucasfilm.  It can't be real.  Get that.  Oh, my God.  I'm really proud of myself.  That is.  Oh, my God.  Get that on.  Get that on, too.  You are being drowned by vomit right there.  I'm very proud of myself at the moment.  Brian, if you're listening, get that up on my front page, too.  No, get that.  That doesn't look real.  Because someone really captured it.  I have to assure the people, it is absolutely authentic. 
[02:40:00]  That's a perfect shot.  It is a perfect shot.  The sheer vomit.  You can't see his head.  His entire head is obscured by a cavalcade of vomit.  That picture's our whack bag.  We're going to get it on opianathy.com as well.  There's only one way to describe it.  The baby bird.  The baby bird.  Get that on opianathy.  Get away from me.  That description, that name will live in infamy.  The baby bird.  Get the fuck away.  Are you insane?  We could sell that shot.  That is a beautiful shot.  That says it all right there. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Hang it up on your wall.  I would hang that up on my wall.  Yeah, that's a print.  Because he's in a power position, Pat from Monaki.  He's almost like a gladiator.  You know what?  For next year, you guys should put flyers up.  Put this.  You could put this in fucking Madison Square Garden.  Put flyers up all around the city.  This year, we will top it.  Right.  And have that poster.  Yeah.  We will top the baby bird.  Next year, we finally bring this out to you guys.  It's got to be at a venue next year.  It has to be.  A big one, too.  Pat Duffy has to sit outside.  Pat, we love you.  Yeah, no offense. 
[02:41:00]  No offense.  You did a great job.  You don't believe it.  But you've got to get the fuck out of here.  Sure, whatever plug you want.  I just want to plug my MySpace page.  MySpace.com slash all-purpose cleaner.  All-purpose cleaner.  All-purpose cleaner.  You're going to remember that, though.  How appropriate.  Yeah, no kiss.  Certainly.  You guys want to hear the finale?  Yeah, please.  You guys got it in a good spot?  Yeah.  Any setup needed?  Nothing?  No, it starts right as Pat is about to lose it.  All right, so it's the baby bird.  We had Pat Duffy, his head over the garbage pail, like he's getting his hair washed before 
[02:41:30]  a haircut.  Yep.  And Pat is about to get rid of 75 double shots of eggnog.  Here we go.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 76.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  It's happening.  The baby bird is happening.  I love you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  No way. 
[02:42:00]  No way.  No way that that just happened.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I almost wet myself.  I swear to you.  I'm laughing so hard.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard.  He ran into the corner.  Oh, yeah.  A thunderous round of applause.  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat. 
[02:43:00]  He's wearing puke blackface.  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  It's impossible to talk about that.  It's impossible.  And there you go.  Oh, wow.  Is that great to listen to?  Wow.  The shock and pandemonium that went on.  I like how Opie kept trying to talk.  And right as he'd start to say half a sentence, Pat would puke again.  I like how you kept saying, there's no way that's going down.  There's no way that is going down.  I think it was him.  Was that you?  Yeah, I know.  It's hard to tell who is who. 
[02:43:30]  And the first vomit, the first bit of vomit went into his mouth and wasn't like that fire hose vomit.  Right.  So we were like, oh, my God, the baby bird's happening.  And it just kept getting worse and worse and worse.  And you could hear the crowd escalating with each one.  We were like, no.  And then when he turned his head.  Are we getting that shot up on opianthony.com?  All right.  Here's the deal.  Anthony, people are trying to see the video on Joe Rogan's site. 
[02:44:00]  Joe Rogan.net.  Dot net, yeah.  Your site's pretty much crashed.  We just mentioned Wack Bag.  They're pretty much in screwed mode right now as well.  People are going all over the place trying to find the video and the picture.  It's going to be up on YouTube.  It's on YouTube already because it's on YouTube through my site.  All right.  And it's also going to be on opianthony.com very soon.  Right there, Steve-O?  Indeed.  You all right?  I'm getting there.  Oh, God.  Holy.  That audio was perfect.  It just encapsulated how fucking amazing that was. 
[02:44:30]  And some don'ts are like, all we're hearing is you guys reacting.  If you can't figure out the pictures at that point, I don't know what to tell you.  When you see the video and you hear the audio together, oh, my fucking God.  It sounded like there were 150 people in there.  Yeah.  And there was like 12.  All disgusted.  I saw, we did 150-something episodes of Fear Factor.  I've never seen anything even come close to that, to being mad.  It's like watching people chew gum.  It was like watching someone else chew somebody else's gum.  That's what every stunt on Fear Factor was. 
[02:45:00]  It was like, oh, he's chewing someone else's gum.  This is crazy.  We just blew Joe Rogan's mind.  It was nothing.  Nothing's going to happen.  It was his idea.  Mark in South Carolina, what's up?  Hey, man, that seemed like a true-life version of the aristocrats.  Ta-da!  Ta-da!  Oh, Pat should have done that.  Oh, that was hilarious.  Where is Pat?  We haven't seen him yet.  Pat from Inaki.  He's probably dropping soft serve into the toilet over at Free FM.  Soft serve?  Well, it takes a lot out of him.  Last year, he was pretty much passed out in the bathroom for like an hour. 
[02:45:30]  He was shitting and puking for like an hour, and then he started sleeping on the urinal.  I mean, on the toilet there.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to hear from the people that almost turned the radio off.  Whatever.  Let's say hi to Brian in Canada.  XM Canada checking in.  Brian.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi.  I just got to let you guys know that when you bring guests on your show, you bring absolutely  the best out of your guests.  And I owe Joe Rogan an apology, because I wouldn't have given him an ounce of credit until listening  to him yesterday and today. 
[02:46:00]  So I apologize, Joe, and keep up the good stuff.  If I didn't know me, I'd probably think I was a dick, too.  Joe's the man.  No, Joe's the man.  Joe, and we got the good stuff in Canada, man.  You think you got the good stuff.  The good stuff in California.  We got botanists and scientists.  You guys got the fucking hockey players.  Exactly.  What are you guys doing?  Fucking raining in Paul Bernardo's backyard.  Joe, I got a story that you'll appreciate.  You might not believe me, but at one time I was taking five pounds with me, selling it  from across the country, sat on a train next to this dynamite girl, was talking to her. 
[02:46:30]  There's no seats on the train.  And I said to her, what do you do for a living?  She goes, I'm a cop.  I said, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  I swear to God in my life.  She was dynamite?  Half an hour later, she's jerking me off.  Really?  You got jerked off by a cop?  The only thing would be better if you came into the marijuana.  Yeah, and they made her smoke it.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow, you got jerked off by a cop?  Yeah, jerked off by a cop carrying five pounds a week.  That's a pretty fucking good story.  I got blown by a cop, but it was Kenny. 
[02:47:00]  Kenny couldn't take it.  That's the one story I've got to tell for the rest of my life, but that's a good story, dude.  All right, right on.  Let's go to Allen in Texas.  Allen.  Yeah, what's happening?  What's up, Allen?  That was the best radio I've heard yet.  I'm buying like five XMs or five of my friends just on today alone.  All right, good boy.  That was awesome.  I couldn't even hear my own radio over my own screaming.  That's pretty cool.  That's a compliment.  Bill, the trucker, what's up?  Hey, you know, on that video, if I tune it in, I do not want to see that stupid Foundry 
[02:47:30]  Music logo all over the money shot.  No, it'll be on YouTube, man.  It's on YouTube clean from my website.  And it'll be all over the place, man.  Yeah, tell freaking Steve to make his Foundry Music logo a little small so it's all about  the baby bird.  We need just pure puket.  Oh, is he putting the watermark on the video?  Just throw the video up, man.  Just the video.  Everybody doesn't know FoundryMusic.com by now?  Yeah, they know. 
[02:48:00]  Make sure it makes it a little smaller than usual, please.  Are you going to be LBAnthony.com on there?  Yeah, I will.  What about EatABullet.com?  Oh, no.  Actually, MySpace.com slash Jim Norton has the HD video.  It has the high-definition version, but I don't want to plug it.  But if you want to go there, and there's also a free download, and you can scratch and  smell it.  That's okay.  Interaction, stop motion, different camera angles.  A lot of laughs.  Make your mouse vibrate when the throw-up hits.  It's got like a shock effect.  That cop story turned me on.  That was very sexy. 
[02:48:30]  That was kind of cool.  Fuck yeah, she jerks.  I'm in a handjob role.  It's all I'm thinking about is getting jerked off lately.  Why handjobs?  I don't know.  I can't stop buying them from fucking...  I go to these clip fucking stores online, and all I want to do is get fucking innocent  handjob videos.  You get videos of handjobs?  Really?  They're a handjob video?  Yeah, that seems like the beginning of the video.  But there's something sexy about that...  A guy getting jerked off, there's something innocent about getting jerked off.  And if a girl jerks you off right, there's nothing...  I mean, there's a lot better, but I mean, it's fucking hot. 
[02:49:00]  Nothing better, man.  Nothing better than something you can do by yourself.  No, I like your girl jerking you off.  Because I guess there's just the motion of a smooth handjob.  Thank you, sir.  Most girls aren't that good.  I used to do a joke about having a girl jerk you off.  It's like trying to brush your teeth with your left hand.  It's like, there's no way you can get the same rhythm, you know?  Your right hand...  My right hand knows every fucking cranny and every...  My left hand is just palsy.  I can't get a speed going.  When a girl's jerking me off, I gotta hold my breath to see if I can come quicker. 
[02:49:30]  Your toes are all pointed out and shit.  Squeezing it.  Squeezing.  Try.  Try.  And then the rhythm just gets messed up.  When they get tired, they have to switch hands.  Yeah, they do this.  They open, close, open, close their hand.  It's like, look, you're not fucking...  You're not throwing a knuckleball, Necro.  Grab my dick again.  God, I hope you hurry up.  I don't know how I...  Hey, Jamie Mossad is here from the Laugh Factory.  Baddy.  Baddy.  He's here in studio?  He's right over there.  We'll talk to him next.  He wants to talk more about Kramer.  How long is he going to milk that shit?  No, I'm kidding.  The owner of the Laugh Factory.  He's going to ride that bitch right into the beach.  I love the apology.  There'll be no more N-word all over the world. 
[02:50:00]  We're going to have a special speech and no more N-word.  And as he's doing that, the Laugh Factory logo is right behind him.  Yeah, huge.  We're going to march with Laugh Factory flag with a big N-word.  It's going to say nigger, but with a line through it.  So no more.  So everybody know what we say.  All right, we're going to step aside.  Bill Burr in studio, Joe Rogan in studio.  Joe's playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long.  Kenny, you're walking around rather quickly. 
[02:50:30]  All good?  All hustle and bustle.  Thanks, a little pepper for my egg whites.  Thanks, Kenny.  Mr. Rogan, would you like anything?  No, I'm good, brother.  Thank you.  Mr. Racist?  Thank you.  Amazing Racist is okay.  All right.  Mr. Barney.  Oh, B.  Anthony.  This is unpredictable radio.  Holy crap.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  Look at you.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God. 
[02:51:00]  I'm a grown man and I'm being yelled at.  Oh, man.  You're idiots.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mama Bird.  Mama Bird has entered the studio.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's from Munaki.  New in love.  By the way, this is like the post show.  Yeah.  From the eggnog drinking contest.  Now we get all the interviews and stuff.  He could have a towel around his neck.  Yeah.  In front of a locker. 
[02:51:30]  The champion.  Pat, I never doubted you, first of all.  Never doubted you.  I thought that love thing was going to be a little bit of a problem.  But right when the competition started, you could see you again relaxed.  Not even a problem.  Doing the shots.  Everybody else kind of had that look on their face.  They were scared.  You, a true champion.  And congratulations on your victory this year.  Oh, thank you.  It was a little rough, but love pulled me through. 
[02:52:00]  And he set the record, too.  His own record.  75 double shots.  You should tell your girl that you had to look at her face while you were throwing up  on someone's mouth thinking of her.  By the way, the shot of the competition, I think one of the whack baggers captured this,  but it's now on opiananthony.com.  This is the shot of the competition.  This will be on so many freaking computer screens in the coming days.  That, to me, is the perfect shot that says it all.  Ali is over Frasier.  You know, that's Sonny Liston.  Sonny Liston, I'm sorry. 
[02:52:30]  Sonny Liston.  That's just a famous sports shot right there.  I just love, like, the white light.  It's like his soul.  It doesn't look real.  It's leaving his body.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  It's like an exorcist or something is going on there.  Could someone do us a favor and make that into a poster so we can have it in our studio?  Oh, I love it.  A spider covering his prey.  And then Baby Bird just sitting there with his arms folded, completely relaxed, as if  this is the natural way to eat.  It's so funny how Steve has to get that foundrymusic.com URL on it.  Perish the thought. 
[02:53:00]  His logo isn't on it.  It looks like what was in Marcellus Wallace's suitcase.  That is just amazing how much volume is coming out.  And I like his stance, too.  He's got a nice stance for the power boost.  He didn't even really bend over to aim that much at his mouth, because why bother with  that much coming out?  He kept good posture.  It's like an old football card picture.  That last eggnog was wafer thin. 
[02:53:30]  It's hard to describe how covered.  He's obscured from the waist to his head.  All you see are his legs.  You've puked all over his upper half.  It looks like I'm building a human.  Pat Duffy is insane.  That is amazing.  The picture is just amazing.  It's so beautiful how the whole event just escalated.  Escalated.  Couldn't have asked for a better ending.  Timing-wise, perfect. 
[02:54:00]  It really was the greatest moment.  It was the greatest moment in radio history.  You look like a dragon, Pat.  You look like a dragon.  You're a mythical creature.  Godzilla.  Boot the magic dragon.  Pat's on fire today.  You feeling all right now?  Like a monk.  You feeling all right?  Oh, yeah.  I puked out most of it, and then I shit out most of it.  Cool.  Yeah.  Did you check your eye?  It was getting very liquidy.  You too.  You could have shittin' his mouth.  He probably would have done that.  I had to throw away my underwear over and see it. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, God.  Why?  Someone should get that and put it on eBay.  Yeah.  You get $1,000 for that underwear.  Put the hole in the middle.  Or save it for the next competition.  Yeah.  And I think something happened where there was a little splatter going on, so I had to...  Oh, my God.  What?  You got some shit in your underwear?  Yeah, a little splatter effect.  That's what happens.  That's helping.  Now, where is that?  Somebody should sell that underwear.  Where's the underwear?  Just in the...  3FM.  No, I know that.  Just where, though?  Just threw it in the...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  In the garbage.  In the bathroom.  So, you're going commando?  Yeah.  Under the sound booth.  Like, so the fucking next fucking phone...  Yeah, what is that? 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  So, yeah, you're running without any underwear.  Yeah.  You got some splatters, and you puked on a man's face.  Yeah.  All right.  See the shot on opnet.com.  All for a woman.  It's just amazing.  All for the love of a woman.  Yeah.  Our website's getting destroyed, too, by the way.  All websites are getting destroyed as people try to find pictures and video and whatnot  from the contest.  We're going to have hundreds of pictures up eventually.  And Sam ran home to get the video up on YouTube.  The real video.  He's got some crystal clear.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Rogan got the first video out there, but, you know, we'll have even better video as 
[02:55:30]  we go.  Cell phone.  The new LG Envy.  And what the hell is HDNet going to do with that video, I wonder?  Hey, now does Master Paul realize he's going to have to step up his game to compete as  they're trying to suit the same young lady?  They're courting her.  They're courting.  Two suitors.  For real?  Yeah.  And now Master Paul's going to have to realize that...  No, I'm not going to court her.  He's in the backseat.  Oh, yeah.  Master Paul's trying to bang your girl?  No.  No.  No?  No.  Does she know you like her?  I think so. 
[02:56:00]  I told her several times.  He told her he was in love with her.  Yeah.  He said, I love you to her.  You tell her a lot?  And she was like, oh, I love you.  We danced on the big piano.  You didn't really, did you?  Yeah.  I thought you were joking.  No.  You went to FAO Schwartz and danced on the piano like big.  Yeah.  Dude.  Yeah.  She just wants, you know.  From the new movie, Fat.  She doesn't want all that romancing.  She wants to get right into it.  Have you stuck it in yet?  You want to bring her in, Joe?  You want to get the feel for what's going on here? 
[02:56:30]  Sure.  Pat is in love with this girl that you're about to meet for the first time.  Let's bring her in.  For sure.  She's a nice girl.  Really head over heels.  I mean, you've got to respect him as a champion now, you know.  When was the last time somebody won a championship and they didn't get pussy that night?  Absolutely.  He's at the peak of his powers right now.  This is the girl that Pat's in love with.  We're not really sure if she's in love with Pat, though.  We don't know.  They're friends.  She's living with Master Poe, by the way.  Living in the same house.  She can sit in my chair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at Pat.  What a gentleman.  When he sleeps upstairs, she sleeps on the couch downstairs and vice versa. 
[02:57:00]  Never the twain shall meet in bed.  I can't hear her.  With the dogs?  Turn her mic up, please.  Does Pat shave with a shard of glass?  An ice pick.  A shard of glass.  Are you proud of your man?  Her friend.  Oh, could you just fake it and say, are you proud of your man?  Yes, I'm proud of my man.  Your man.  See, I'm helping you out there, Pat.  Oh, thank you.  I'm trying to fucking help you out again.  Well, Pat, why don't you tell her that you love her again?  And then let's see what she has to say.  And then Joe's taking a look here. 
[02:57:30]  He'll give you an honest opinion here.  Tanya.  And this is real, by the way, Joe.  This isn't a dumb radio bit.  The Pat really loves this girl.  I love you.  With all my heart.  I love you, too.  Didn't sound quite the way I said it.  No, it's kind of like, I love you like, you know, a friend.  So depressing.  In the height of his powers.  I know.  This is like...  This is going to get...  Are you feeling anything, Joe?  It's all downhill from here.  There's no energy there at all.  This is the best you should tell her.  I guess she wasn't impressed by my puking. 
[02:58:00]  Well, no, maybe it was me.  I had to throw my underwear out because I shit in the story.  This is the best you're...  Oh, there's nothing happening there.  That's like trying to start a fire rubbing two wet newspapers together.  There's nothing going on.  Nothing going on, right?  Pat, you do understand, like, this is the best your feathers are going to look, your plumage.  This is the best...  You're a champion.  You look, yeah, you can never look better than this, and she's kind of...  Laughing at me?  Yeah.  Have you guys ever made out or anything? 
[02:58:30]  No.  No making out?  How are you in love with her?  Because it makes me happy to make her happy.  Whoa.  All right, listen.  What a weird biological trick that is, huh?  Wow.  Let's get into this, though.  You moved from Missouri, right?  Right.  And you're living with Master Poe?  Right.  Have you made out with Master Poe?  No.  Come on.  You know...  Oh, you rolled your eyes.  You have made out of Master Poe.  I'm sorry to just show me, man.  Have you woken up unconscious?  Have you ever blown Master Poe?  No.  No kissing?  No.  Jerk him off?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Give me a second, bro.  You didn't know. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, hey, look at Pat stepping in.  Pat's getting a little defensive.  Nothing.  A little defensive.  Pat and Rogan are going to throw down.  Should we get Master Poe in here?  So you and Master Poe just buddies?  Master Poe!  Yes, Master Poe is my buddy.  Have you ever woken up unconscious feeling as though you've been touched?  Watch out if he takes his shoes off.  Like Billy Jack.  Master Poe is staring down Pat from Anaki now.  Why?  We need a little mic.  Yeah, why is that?  I really want to know the dynamic here.  Yeah, there's something going on.  Pat really, really loves this girl. 
[02:59:30]  This is not a radio bet.  And he's claiming his woman.  Look at his hand.  Yeah, we're getting Master Poe a mic now.  Yep.  Pat right now has his hand on her shoulder.  She's got a little light-up Christmas hat on.  And now he's rubbing her shoulder a little bit.  You bought her that hat?  Yes, I did.  And you're wearing it with pride.  It was by the tree lighting.  I took her to see the tree.  You two went to the tree lighting?  No, not the lighting. 
[03:00:00]  I was still crying for that.  To see the tree.  Yeah.  I've never seen a Christmas tree.  Sorry.  I've never had a Christmas tree before, so.  Never did?  Yeah.  What the fuck's going on?  They went and got me a Christmas tree.  What are you, Jew?  No.  No?  You've never had a Christmas tree?  I've never had a Christmas tree.  And this has got to be the bestest Christmas for her ever.  I'm going to make sure.  It's going to be a trailer park Christmas.  Let's get Master Poe involved here.  Master Poe.  Good morning, gentlemen.  This is a roommate of yours?  Yes.  Don't talk so. 
[03:00:30]  You've got to back off the mic.  Poe was very animated this morning.  He's very clipped.  Yeah.  What's going on, Poe?  Now, she lives in your house.  Yes, she does.  Now, how did this come about?  Well, she had a very bad situation in Missouri, and she came over here to New Jersey.  And Pat, myself, and Jay are helping her out.  All right.  Bad situation, bad relationship?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you had to get out of there.  Restraining orders?  No, I just left.  You just left? 
[03:01:00]  Was he abusive?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was it a boyfriend?  Yes.  Oh, I was going to see.  The next question was a really hurtful one.  Family member.  But, okay, boyfriend.  Kind of abusive.  Did he beat you with a...  Mentally or physically?  Yes.  Yes.  Both.  Both.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Pat's very...  Pat has a big rescuing instinct in this one, I think.  Yes, he is.  Maybe all you needed was...  That's mama bird.  Q-tips to clear your ears out so you can hear better.  That's why she's staying at Poe's, because Poe's very protective. 
[03:01:30]  Ah.  Not only a F.H. Riley guy.  Yeah.  He's also very protective.  He's a master in the...  Did you say F.H. Riley's?  Yeah, 400 New York Ave, Huntington, New York.  Yes, right.  Yeah, I know that place.  Very fine.  Poe is protective.  He needs a green shirt that matches nothing.  He fucking guards it with his life.  I'm sorry, Poe.  Guards those free turkeys, too.  A fucking black suit with a dark green shirt. 
[03:02:00]  All right, Poe.  So now you went online, I guess, and described your situation as being dire.  No.  What happened?  How did they find out that you were in trouble?  I was on Pal Talk, and just, I told one person, and they, and finally, for like months, I  didn't, but they knew something was up, so.  Yeah.  And then, they just got me out of the place, and I moved down here, and.  So you came down here from Missouri, just because of the internet, because of Pal Talk?  No, just, I wanted to get out of the situation.  Yeah, but I mean, but the connection was made through the internet? 
[03:02:30]  That's pretty badass.  Just through the internet.  Internet's fucking crazy, man.  Yeah, not everybody gets abducted.  Some people get rescued.  My website, on my message board, people have gotten married, had kids, all kinds of crazy  relationships, people have died.  Very bizarre, man.  Yeah.  The internet's crazy.  It's a total different world, man.  Yeah.  So, Poe decided he'd be the place that you would live?  Yeah.  You had a choice now, I guess.  You could have stayed with Pat.  Him, or a couple other people, but. 
[03:03:00]  In the trailer.  Or you could have stayed with Poe.  No, I met her after.  Well, yeah, I went to Poe when I met him.  So, you had already been living with Poe.  Yes.  Now, was there any, did you detect, maybe at the beginning, maybe things were kind of  nipped in the bud.  Did you detect Poe perhaps wanting a little more than just a roomie?  No.  Never?  No.  Always a gentleman.  Very.  But you guys made it at one point.  Poe.  Any comment on why you didn't maybe try? 
[03:03:30]  I know, you know, you fashioned yourself to Casanova.  I just want to know why maybe you didn't make any moves.  She's gone through enough emotional damage.  That she didn't need the likes of you.  That's right.  Trying to.  Did you ever sing to her?  Yes.  I did?  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  What did you sing to her?  From one form of abuse to another.  George White.  All right, Pat.  Touche.  I'm pretty sure they've made out.  What?  I'm pretty sure, Poe, yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Why?  All right.  Why do you say that?  I've seen lying before.  They've totally made out.  Sure.  Being a Jew, everyone you know does it.  Touche.  Poe, do you drink?  Yes.  To excess?  Uh, no.  I never remember.  Uh, you drink a little bit.  Yes.  A little pot?  No, not no more.  No.  Not no more.  I used to.  All right.  Poe, did you make out with her?  Trying to get a little background. 
[03:04:30]  He won't tell.  He's a gentleman.  Yeah.  She's already told me all she needs to.  Those eyes, yeah.  How come you believe it when I say I didn't make out with her?  What the hell?  Well, you got a point there, Pat.  Pat.  So, uh, now, now, all right, they're living together.  They're roomies, whatever it is, helping each other out.  Uh, there's another party involved, or a couple other people that were going to help  you.  A friend of his, Jay.  A friend of his, Jay.  Yes.  All right, what's going on with Jay?  They're just helping me get my life together, basically. 
[03:05:00]  Get your life together by maybe helping you, what, find a job, or?  I got a job.  You got a job.  Can I jump in for a second?  Yeah.  There's a lot of helping going on.  Why don't we ever help the fat chicks?  Uh, they can help themselves.  Exactly.  They're coming out of the woodwork to help themselves.  Yeah, we do help them.  If there's a fucking door, we help them get to it and push them through it.  Beat it, pig.  He's getting a lot of help.  You certainly are getting a lot of help from a lot of people from, uh, across the country.  So, uh, all right, they're helping you out.  Now, Pat comes into the picture. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  So he met you at Poe's house.  Yes.  Now, what brought you to Poe's house?  Uh, well, I'm, uh, friends with Poe.  I live not too far from him, and I come over every once in a while.  All right, you go over every once in a while.  Ah, there you go.  He goes over there for heat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And shelter.  When you want this shit and not look at the grass underneath.  Hey.  You leave your trailer.  Sorry, he's in the last statement.  You leave your trailer, you go to, uh, Poe's house, and, uh, I guess you were invited over 
[03:06:00]  for Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  And you two start chatting.  Yep.  And you hit it off in some way, shape, or form.  Yeah.  She laughs at my jokes.  Where am I going to find a girl like that?  Like my best friend.  Anybody like that.  Friend.  When, when a girl says he's like my best friend, you're so out.  Are you afraid that, like, fooling around with Pat would hurt the friendship?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, I hope to ruin the friendship sometime in the future.  It makes it better.  Pat wants, Pat wants to just destroy the friendship with some ass sex. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Well, I, I look in the mirror, I look in the mirror, and I go, I'm not attracted to me,  so why should anybody else be attracted?  I'm going to lose a whole shitload of weight, and I haven't been working because I don't really  care, and I have something I care about.  And I'm his navigator.  Yeah, she's my navigator when she's not working.  Oh, oh, oh.  The devastation.  You go on, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wants to play, he wants to play baby bird with you while he's still able to whistle.  Ow.  Oh.  It's, uh.  Ow.  Pat's at my house till about one, two o'clock in the morning sometimes. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, really?  So wait a minute now.  Pat, you said you're kind of saying you have something that motivates you, and it's  time.  Yes.  Yes.  What do you guys sing in the car, for anybody that might not have heard earlier?  All kinds of, Once Bitten, Twice Shy, that's one of her favorites.  Oh, you like that one?  Harley Davidson Road Song CD.  Yeah.  That's all scratched up now.  How old are you?  25.  Yeah.  You're 25, but you're into a lot of this classic rock.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, and Pat likes that.  It kind of brings you two together a little bit.  Yeah.  I, I, I, how many times has she seen Pat cry? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Have you seen him cry?  A little bit.  A little, yeah.  Movies?  Ew.  I know.  He, yeah, that, that, uh, he opens in a fall, really.  Well, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Not movie, wait, wait, wait.  He opens up.  That's a sensitive guy.  He's a good guy.  He opens up to you a little bit about things.  What happened, Kyle?  I was telling him a story once, and he had.  I was telling her about how I wasn't happy.  Yes.  And then I met her, and now I'm happy.  And he came to her.  He's sweet.  That's terrific. 
[03:08:00]  Let me tell you something.  That's terrific.  You are, you should actually be in a book about love and everything you should not do, especially  at the beginning.  Oh.  You are doing everything wrong.  And I'll tell you why he's at your house until 2.30 in the morning.  He's making sure she's fucking asleep or out of the fight.  It's like, yeah, it's like he'll just be there watching and go, okay, I'll leave.  He's Poe blocking.  Poe, you got to be up until 3.30 in the morning.  Time to get there. 
[03:08:30]  You know how that is.  I'd tell him to stay until 2 o'clock in the morning.  And then he goes back to the trailer and just stares at the stars through the hole in  the roof.  My sunroof.  Look at that, a shooting star.  Let me wish upon it.  Cessna crashing into your house, but lives right by Teterboro.  Toto-barrel.  It's always a toe joke.  It really is.  Yeah.  Have you seen his nine toes? 
[03:09:00]  How do you guess?  Yeah.  How'd you lose a toe?  Diabetes.  Eggnug.  A little sugar.  I didn't take care of my sugar.  Got a little high.  4.65, I believe, when I walked into the emergency room.  Hacked it off.  $250,000 bill later.  $250,000 for taking a toe off?  Well, I had like two and a half months of antibiotic treatment.  Sounds like the fucking mob.  Yeah.  We would have done it for 100 grams. 
[03:09:30]  You take your fucking toe.  So how often do you have to take insulin?  I take something else called Bayetta.  Works pretty good.  How often do you have to take it?  That's my sister's name.  Every day.  How much do you do?  Once a day?  Just once a day?  Yeah.  It's like an injectable thing.  Oh, you take a shot every day.  Hey, um...  All right.  Poe, do you see, you know, Pat making the moves on her?  No.  No.  No, he's a gentleman.  Yes.  He wants her.  He could be a gentleman, but he's in love.  You know, we're both getting our shit together, so we have time. 
[03:10:00]  We have a...  So...  Oh, it's kind of a mutual, like, misery thing that you're both going through.  So you see this as a way to bond in misery.  Yeah.  She has a look on her face like there's not enough time in the universe.  Wait a minute now, Kanye, is that what it is for you?  I mean, we don't know.  Is it a matter of just, like, is Pat getting stuck?  Pat has some goals now that you've motivated him to want to achieve?  Like, he wants to lose weight, throw up on other men's mouths, and shit his pants in the bathroom?  Yeah.  I plan on being a different person in three, six months. 
[03:10:30]  Really?  Three, six?  So, whatever she thinks now, it doesn't matter.  We are friends.  We do get along, and we listen to the same music.  We have fun.  She laughs.  So you're changing for her?  Yes.  You're trying to be what she wants.  No, no.  This is what I wanted, but I didn't have the proper motivation.  Right, right, right.  Brundle Munaki.  And if nothing ever happens of it, he's put a weird fly reference.  Shuking on his food.  And this is why they hang out with each other so much,  because they like the same music.  Yeah.  So, you're inspired. 
[03:11:00]  The heartbreak this guy is heading for.  Oh, we see it coming.  This is like the mistake like a 16-year-old makes.  Right.  This is like, everyone sees the heartbreak coming.  It's on its way.  You can hear the horn.  Ooh, choo, choo.  It's coming.  It's not even far away.  Well, let's ask.  What?  How is this going to end in your world?  Yeah.  How does it end in your world?  Murder, suicide.  No, ours are just misery.  Yeah.  I'll go back into trail of safety.  By the way, how do you want it to end? 
[03:11:30]  How do you want this to turn out?  You would like her as a girlfriend, right?  Marriage.  As a wife.  Yeah.  A wife.  Our children.  Little Pat from Munaki or wherever I'm living.  And now, Tanya, what are you looking for?  Like, of course, you've been through some shit.  You come up here.  You're trying to get your life together.  What are your goals, short-term, medium-term?  Like, where do you want to be in, let's say, a year?  What do you want to be doing with yourself? 
[03:12:00]  Do you still want to be hooking up with Poe every couple weeks?  I don't hook up with Poe.  I sleep with the dogs.  But do you want your own place?  Yes.  All right.  Eventually.  And a job.  You say you got a job?  What are you doing?  I work at Chevy's and his navigator.  The Chevy's I don't like because I can't understand the way they talk.  They're all foreign.  A bunch of PR.  Hispanic.  And I'm like, what?  What?  Chevy's like Mexican food?  Yeah.  All right.  To make a good fajita at Chevy's. 
[03:12:30]  I like Chevy's.  Casadillas, too.  Hey, Poe, how bad do you want her if she gets her act together?  Casadillas?  Casadillas.  What's a quesadilla?  That's not even in my mind right now.  It's a cassette and quesadilla.  That hasn't crossed my mind at all.  What hasn't, Poe?  I didn't hear you, sweetie.  I asked Poe how bad does he want her if she gets her act together.  Well, I mean, she's a very attractive girl.  I mean, this is an honest question.  It's not a bad question.  Have you ever, like, been masturbating about something else and she flashes through your  head because you happen to see her walk by in the night?  It happens.  That's not a bad question.  If you're a guy, she's a beautiful girl, it doesn't mean you don't respect her. 
[03:13:00]  It starts and ends with her.  No.  She is gorgeous.  Absolutely.  She's a very pretty girl.  What does she wear around the house?  Yeah, speaking of that, what does she wear?  Sweats.  Sweats.  But now...  You should have a dress code in your house.  Two words.  Easy access.  What kind of privacy is there as far as, you know, getting dressed, walking around the  house?  Maybe, you know, you got to go to the bathroom later at night.  You walk out.  You don't want to get dressed.  What do you do?  Rep a towel around me and run upstairs. 
[03:13:30]  A little towel and run upstairs.  And what do you...  Poe, do you hear the creaking?  Have you seen her do that?  Do you hear the creaking up the stairs and open the door?  That'd be a nice visual that could seep into...  That's when he's not there.  When he's there, I dress in the bathroom.  It doesn't mean that he's doing it thinking of you.  It happens sometimes.  Like, you're just doing it.  You're in the middle of whatever fantasy you have.  Maybe you're kicking teeth in somewhere and it's just another person.  Right.  It happens.  Somebody walks through your fantasy.  Yeah.  Just as Norton's saying it doesn't mean it's gross.  It's a guest star.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I've had friends walk through my fantasy.  Not sexually. 
[03:14:00]  I'm jerking off.  All of a sudden, I'm thinking of my buddy Bill D'Angelo.  What the hell Bill's doing?  And then I'm like, oh, I'm back to reality.  I'm back to jerking off.  Could you just stand up and open your coat?  I don't really get a good sense of you.  Yeah, she's very cute.  Like, I want to see.  I don't...  Because she's all covered up.  That's the idea.  She's not wearing...  Wow.  That's the idea.  I just want to see.  All right.  Very nice.  Lovely little figure.  Take a little spin.  A little Santa hat?  Yeah, like a little...  There you go.  All right.  Please.  Yeah, that's nice.  Quite a hiney on her. 
[03:14:30]  That's nice.  I think you might be out of your league.  That looks nervous for the first...  Well, respect, gentlemen.  With all due respect, Pat, we're just saying, because she was, you know, wrapped up in a  leather coat, we couldn't really see.  What a rollercoaster ride today is for Pat.  At the top of the heap and now just crashing into reality.  Just realizing the reality of the situation.  You're competing, you know, in some way or another, you know, even though it's just her  living there.  But there's some type of almost competition going on between Paul and Pat. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah?  All right.  First of all, we don't get along.  We're always arguing.  Okay?  You and Patty's arguing.  That's called sexual tension.  Always arguing.  Why are you guys arguing?  What's the problem?  I argue so much that I just walk out.  You and Tanya?  Yeah.  Why?  She says no.  You're like, it's my house.  I'll throw you out.  Why do you guys argue?  We argue because she wants to do things...  Very.  You know who else?  And my dogs, they love her. 
[03:15:30]  They protect her.  Yeah.  They growl at me now.  Is it true you renamed your house F.H. Poe?  Bruce Willis and Sybil Shepard argued a lot on a little TV show called Moonlighter.  That's right.  And they never...  Ted Danson, Shelley Lange.  Right.  They were always arguing.  Absolutely.  Rieger and Danny DeVito.  Right.  They were arguing right up until he fucked him in the ass.  Well, like what?  Give me an example.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like the other night, he didn't want me coming up here. 
[03:16:00]  Why?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  You can't get in the way of our radio show, Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  Poe had that little blink.  Poe blinked a couple times.  Poe's mic blocking us.  All right.  The last O&A show that she was at, she got carried away.  And she drank and, you know, she did things that she wasn't supposed to.  What O&A show?  What did she do?  Halloween.  Halloween show.  Halloween show?  What things?  I got too drunk and my eyes were rolling in the back of my head.  What did you do that you're not supposed to?  And she disappeared. 
[03:16:30]  But I haven't done that since, have I?  No.  Of course not.  What did you do?  What did you do?  You weren't supposed to.  You fucked a black eye, didn't you?  Oh, no, no, no.  Pat.  No, I just got to.  Are you going to tolerate that, Pat?  Oh.  They were supposed to watch.  No, Poe's almost arm's length away from him.  I'd like to.  A legit question.  What'd you do?  Yeah, yeah.  That's not a bad question because you're saying you did something.  You're like, yeah, but I didn't do it again.  I was like, what'd you do?  I just got drunk and they were supposed to be watching me because, you know, I was nervous.  And I wound up getting lost.  I went, took off with Patty and they got upset with me. 
[03:17:00]  Stalker Patty?  No.  Different Patty.  Patty 2006.  She disappeared for two hours.  Wait, that's the new model?  But I was just up at the...  Do you have a cell phone?  I do.  And you are a grown adult, right?  Right.  Can't you just go wherever you want to go?  Got drunk.  Oh, she just looked at Poe.  You know, let me tell you something.  Go ahead.  Set down the rules.  She's repeating this abusive relationship.  Right.  I was just going to say something like that.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  Maybe the way you are, you're looking for people.  And you don't know this. 
[03:17:30]  A lot of women just do this subconsciously.  You're looking at another kind of relationship where you're being dominated a little.  And you, no offense, Poe, I'm just saying, because you're not in a relationship, so that's  kind of silly.  But, you know, and here you have the sweetest guy in the world who would treat you like a  princess.  The princess she is.  But you seem to want guys that are geared with a fuck, what are you, you're not supposed  to do this, you know, arguing all the time. 
[03:18:00]  And meanwhile, you'd be, you'd say something to Pat, and he'd be, oh, okay, sweetie.  All right, schmookums.  Let me just say, you guys are very perceptive.  Nothing dries her up more.  Yeah, Pat, you got to get a little, a little talk in your talk.  He wants, hey, bitch, what the fuck are you doing out?  And Poe's not abusive.  Poe's not, I don't think he's abusive.  I think Poe is just a rescuer, a codependent rescuer.  He's not, he's not going to have to dominate a chick or be mean to her.  He just wants to smother her and love her.  I don't think he's mean.  But, but, but his style is, hey. 
[03:18:30]  And he's a Latin.  They're very possessive.  Where the fuck were you?  The Latins.  Where did you go?  Woman, cook me dinner.  Yeah, I told you this.  You'll get something like that.  They're very parental.  Yeah.  That's right, but the Latin.  They're very possessive.  Darker cocks than the lights.  Where did you, where did you disappear off to?  Just where that clock guy, whatever his name was.  Flay the Flay.  Uh-oh, wait, you were in Flay's dressing room?  With six of his posse?  Oh, fuck.  I just went to the front of the stage just dancing with Patty and Neo God. 
[03:19:00]  And who?  Oh, it was God.  Oh, wait a minute.  Were there girls involved?  Because I looked down at one point.  Yeah, you were making out with some girl.  Happy timing girl.  I swear to God.  You saw that from the stage.  Yeah, I think I saw that from the stage.  Frenchie hair?  That was me.  It was, what's her name?  Fucking, oh, the sexy one, baby girl from Palette.  Yeah, I saw a few other.  I don't know if it was you, but I saw a baby girl kissing somebody.  I saw a few other girls.  There was just like kissing Frenchie, it wasn't me.  There was another girl involved with it.  Happy timing girl.  Poe, comment.  Licking girls.  Did you see anything like that or hear about it?  Well, that was the time that she was gone for two hours. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  All right, so we really didn't know where she was.  Well, you know why.  And yes, she is 25, and she is a woman, so she can decide on where she wants to go.  But as long as she lives under your fucking room, it's going to be by my rules.  No, no, no, no.  Guys.  Okay.  She was topless unless you're eating dinner.  First time I've seen Poe sweat.  Hey, Poe, have you guys said to her, look, I paid the bills around here.  Has that come out yet?  That's right.  Go in there and cook dinner.  No.  He's like, woman, get in there and clean the kitchen.  Get in there and cook my dinner.  Why don't we wrap this up?  Pat, why don't you get on your knee and confess your love to this professor? 
[03:20:00]  It's been a while.  Is she uncomfortable with this, Tanya?  Are you uncomfortable with this?  Pat, really, like, tell her why you love her and what you would like between the two of you.  Just let her know exactly how you feel.  That might be what she needs.  Tanya?  Is that a part or a part of my breath?  Pardon my breath. 
[03:20:30]  Yes, I just puked on a man.  That could have been me.  Have I told you lately I love you?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, a couple seconds ago.  I would like to make a life with you in the future when I am a better person.  Are you going to cry?  Yeah, no.  Pat, Pat.  I'm going to cry?  I'm going to cry?  No, I'm going to cry.  Pat, Pat.  Let's talk something.  My knee hurts real bad right now.  What does she mean to you?  I'm so fat.  Tell Tanya what she means to you, how she's changed your life. 
[03:21:00]  You mean everything.  And stop hiding behind humor.  Get him.  I didn't care.  People might not notice this, but I wasn't very happy before.  And when I met you, now I'm happy.  So it doesn't matter if anything ever happens.  You're going to cry, honey.  See, this is every day.  This ends in murder-suicide.  They cry every day.  Restraining orders.  There's going to be restraining orders. 
[03:21:30]  Pat, Pat.  I want to be Tristan in Legend of the Fallen.  You were sad.  Pose the older brother.  You were sad when you met Tanya.  Yeah.  And then you're saying what she's done for you, but I mean, like, how are you not sad anymore?  Like, what do you see this?  You should tell her where you see this going.  Well, everything.  I'd marry her tomorrow, but I'm not the person who'd be worthy of marrying her.  Some wedding.  Wow.  Yeah.  Carry over the threshold.  But I'm a mess.  But I'm a mess.  And when I'm not a mess, I'll pursue that. 
[03:22:00]  Page one.  Right now we're friends and we're spending time together.  That's all I care about.  Get that hammer open.  Putting her on a pedestal.  Oh, she's getting a phone call.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  That's never good.  Who the hell is this?  There you go, Pat.  Just master pull it out.  This is her ex-boyfriend in Missouri.  Yeah.  Get jazzed down here, girl.  Who's calling you?  I don't know who that was.  Who is that?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, wrong number.  Paul, he's dialing in his thing.  Get the fuck away from him. 
[03:22:30]  Let's go to Cleveland.  Leo, what's up?  Hey, you guys missed a great line from Ope.  She said she left with Patty 2006.  He said, what is that, the new model?  Oh, okay.  Thank you for that, sir.  I found that to be rather hurtful.  Yeah, well.  And mean-spirited towards Patty.  All right, we got a break?  All right.  Oh, no, there's text messages.  Yeah, there's...  All right, who's...  Pat.  Pat.  You are screaming in in a fucking flat spin.  Well, what are you doing?  I thought you loved me. 
[03:23:00]  There's no pulling out.  Pat, I suggest you reach for the handle between your legs, pull it, and punch out because  you are going in hot.  You're one of many, man.  Yeah, watch the canopy goose going in hot.  It's just...  I see it coming.  There's no saving this.  If I can't have you, nobody will.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  You know, who knows, man?  You might use this as inspiration to become a totally different human.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  And you might not want her anymore.  You might get a stripper.  A 25-year-old woman was killed today, and the murderer... 
[03:23:30]  And he'll come walking out bloody going, I did it because I loved her.  I loved her.  She's covered with entrails and splatter and...  Yeah.  Make a joke about it.  Chips her brain.  Oh, boy.  We got some pictures coming up, yeah.  Where's that?  I guess she models FBA wear.  Oh, cool.  Oh, cool.  Very nice.  What's wrong with that?  Let's see.  What's wrong with that?  We're supposed to take those down.  Pat, why?  He never did.  That's nice.  Oh, Jesus.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Look at that.  Look at Poe.  Look at Poe. 
[03:24:00]  He's getting upset.  Oh, nice.  This is why I told you not to come.  Poe, I told you she shouldn't have come today.  Pat, this is the love of your life.  I wouldn't mind that so much.  You see a girl's breast and her legs.  Wow, way wide open.  Look who's more upset.  In a barn.  Look who's more upset.  Poe.  Who put these up?  Poe.  Who put the pictures up?  Who took them?  I took them.  Wait, well, you're in them.  It was in Missouri, though.  You're in them.  And I asked Uncle Inky to take them.  I took them on my own.  Uncle Inky.  Holy shit. 
[03:24:30]  Wait, wait.  You set up a camera with a timer?  No, I just, with my webcam in Missouri, I just took it with my, you know, I took one  hand and flipped and...  Oh, I gotcha.  No, no.  Both hands are free.  Yeah.  Did someone take a picture?  I had a less camera crew.  No, someone's taking...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's a little better than a webcam.  No, no, no.  Both hands are free, you're lying on the couch, and that's a high megapixel camera.  That's not a webcam.  Get back to Uncle Inky.  That right there is not a webcam.  Yes, it is.  Oh, come on.  Cut the shit.  I want to hear about Uncle Inky.  I know how to Photoshop.  You know how to Photoshop what?  You know how to change the resolution of the photograph? 
[03:25:00]  Prototype webcam we haven't seen yet.  It's a new one that's coming out in 2012.  No, I don't believe it.  Look at you, it's drugged up in that one.  Look at that.  So Uncle Inky took...  No, I took him.  You took him?  He sent me the clothes, and I took him, and I asked him to take him down, but he never  did.  Why did he take him down?  I think you guys are friends.  We are friends, but...  What's with Uncle Inky, then?  Yeah, what's up with the Uncle Inky?  Come on, Uncle Inky.  That's Pat's girl.  But you took him yourself?  And Aunt Inky is fine with all this?  Did you blink? 
[03:25:30]  What'd you do, blink, and then the camera took the picture?  Uncle Inky, there's gotta be a leather face in this.  Webcam recorder.  Oh, webcam recorder.  Yeah.  Poe, you don't look very happy about this.  What's the matter?  Yeah, Poe isn't happy.  Why aren't you happy?  Poe, get in there.  I'm smiling, I'm fine.  You're not smiling.  No, Poe's a...  That's the type of smile a fucking German Shepherd has before it bites your fucking bag.  Pretty much Poe is picturing...  It's the last smile you'll see.  Pretty much Poe has decided someone has to die today.  He's picturing snapping Uncle Inky's neck or somebody.  Now, you've seen these, right?  You've been very mad, so you screen-capped them, so you can have them for your... 
[03:26:00]  Like, you know, when you're feeling awful things.  But them being up is offensive, right?  No.  Okay.  They're nice pictures.  Very nice.  He's gonna be screaming at it.  Artsy.  Which one do you like best?  Pat, before we go to break, why don't you...  It's not a roast beef shot.  I mean, you know...  I want Pat to work this a little bit.  Let's see if you have a shot.  Get back on your knee and talk this out with her.  Is your knee hurt?  You want to sit in my chair?  No, the part about what it's gonna take for her to like you.  You have to look at the man in the mirror.  Come on.  I told Michael Jackson. 
[03:26:30]  Here.  So you can sit in my seat, Pat.  Or I...  Pat.  Do you say anything like that to her?  Do you want to sit in my seat because your knee was hurting?  You don't have to kneel.  You can sit and talk.  Yeah.  Have a little talk.  We'll just listen in.  This isn't very intimate.  But be honest.  Talk about happiness.  And what you could offer in the end.  Future.  Yeah.  And to get your body together and your washboard abs.  And your actual washboard that you do the laundry on.  You're growing your hair back in for her.  You're changing, Pat.  Yeah.  Pat's gonna be a gym rat.  I'm gonna be a stud.  Come on, Pat.  Thank you. 
[03:27:00]  Let's go, Pat.  Go ahead, Pat.  Don't be awkward.  There we go.  When I become the man I want to be, I will pursue you as to be my girlfriend.  And more.  This is way harder to watch.  Smooth, aren't I?  Yeah.  Well, Pat, and you were very sad.  We all knew you were sad.  You seem like a different person now.  The petting was a little weird.  I didn't see the petting.  See, she wasn't very happy.  Like, when she took those pictures, she wasn't a happy person doing that. 
[03:27:30]  Right.  No, she wasn't.  And in the past three weeks, she's changed a lot.  Oh, because of you.  She's becoming a happy heart.  The last two days, you were very happy.  Oh, as he's done.  Could you help her become happier?  Yeah.  That's my goal in life.  All right.  And what do you have to say to what Pat said?  I've seen better shit come out of your mouth about an hour ago, Pat.  Yeah.  I care about you a lot, and I'm glad I make you happy.  You all.  We all make each other happy.  Yeah.  All make each other.  That's all we need for now.  We.  We.  We.  We.  We.  We.  We.  We, we, we, we, we.  Do you understand when a man loves a woman as much as he loves you, hearing things like 
[03:28:00]  we, and, you know, yeah, we'll be happy.  Who the fuck's we?  Yeah.  He doesn't want to hear that.  He wants.  That's why you gotta talk to her.  Yeah.  That's why you gotta talk to her.  Come on, Pat.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not in a position where I can make it.  Yes, you are.  Me and her.  You are.  No, you are.  You are.  Of course you are.  Ask her who the hell's calling right now.  Yeah, why can't you, Pat?  Yeah, who the fuck is that on? 
[03:28:30]  It was restricted, so, you know, it was fine.  Yeah, uh-oh.  How can we pose?  Hands are out of his pocket.  There's a lot of lies going on here.  He died on his cock.  He's a martial artist.  Why are you saying it's me?  Because you're the only restricted that called me.  You see?  Do you have a message?  Do you see the argument going on?  Do you have a message?  No, I ran out of minutes, so only Verizon people can call me.  It's Verizon calling her a deadbeat.  Let's just pay a phone bill.  Probably haven't got my paycheck yet.  Let's just call other people.  If you're waiting for Pat to pay for her, why not?  I don't pay for my stuff.  It's not.  Pat, do you pay her when she goes to work with you?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Pat. 
[03:29:00]  Jesus Christ.  I'm not worthy of you.  She's very good, because she stays in the van when I do a delivery.  Now I don't have to pay the muni meter, and I don't get tickets.  And I look at the horse's name.  And I go, Toad, Toad, Toad.  Pat, by the time this is done, you're going to want to beat her with the parking meter.  I'm telling you.  Our brother.  You are walking with...  We should take a break.  For your own good.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  My heart should take a break.  Everyone should take a break.  Get in a flak jacket or something.  Oh, please.  It's so...  Oh, my God.  The tragedy I see.  Why aren't you stomping Pat Ramunaki's guts out? 
[03:29:30]  Pat, the truth.  Have we protected her?  Yes.  Have we taken care of her?  Yes.  That was the number one goal.  And we've accomplished quite a bit, haven't we?  And there's people who think...  That.  That's not that.  Exactly.  But it is that.  Well, there's...  We've done miracles.  All right.  Well, keep up the good work, I guess.  Is that going to be the name of the video?  Whatever.  All right, kids.  We've done miracles.  I'm real happy for all of you.  Yeah.  It's a wonderful relationship.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get Jamie Mossad in from the Laugh Factory, okay? 
[03:30:00]  Yes.  All right.  We'll do that next.  Joe Rogan in studio.  Menajah Bluch.  Playing Caroline's all weekend long.  It has nothing to do with if you like us or hate us as long as you're listening.  We are so pathetic.  It's a little dicey.  I get on mic, I call people jerk off, and I look at the internet.  I'll have a bikini peenie.  I'm a feces consistency tester.  We are pieces of shit.  We spend all morning just smashing each other in the face.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  The Norton and Faggot Show.  That's some loud bed music, isn't it? 
[03:30:30]  I hope he's still sipping his fly up as he walks in.  Yeah.  When are they going to fix this microphone, by the way? 
[03:31:00]  Jesus, it's annoying.  I want my thing back.  You ever watch those shows, Seconds from Disaster?  Yeah.  On Discovery?  I love it.  It shows like what happened, some engineering problems, and the end is unavoidable because  of what happened.  You see a building collapse.  You see a bridge collapse.  You see a plane crash.  We are watching that with Pat.  Seconds from Disaster.  She was on the phone with someone as I was going to the bathroom.  Yeah.  There's a whole thing going on. 
[03:31:30]  I'm trying to protect our buddy Pat because he's way out of his league.  He's going to be somewhere one of these days at a pest event, and she's going to be making  out with some guy, and he's going to just look there like, why couldn't that be me?  He's in the major leagues.  He's in peewee ball.  The problem is different with this.  There's not even...  She isn't, though.  Huh?  She's like CBA.  CBA?  Yeah.  But he's like...  Something's going on there.  Yeah.  What are you saying, Ari?  Yeah, she's like pretty good.  The problem is, guys like that, his body type, get laid all the time.  He's just so unconfident.  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  He's no confidence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Joey Diaz.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get Jamie Masada in here.  Buddy.  Buddy.  Buddy.  Seriously.  We'll have to do something about the N-word.  Take it out of dictionary.  For the people that don't know, Jamie Masada is the owner of the Laugh Factory in L.A.  where Kramer did his thing.  Obviously, Joe Rogan has hurt him a lot.  What's up, brother?  How are you, Joe?  Wonderful, Mr. Masada.  And yourself?  I'm doing okay.  I'm doing all right.  I guess... 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to do the best we can do with all of the comedians that are surrounding you  guys.  And, you know, especially Joe and everybody in here, they're thinking of what I did with  banning the N.  It was kind of like a...  You mean the word nigger?  Please.  Please be nice.  Can't say it?  You know...  Just say that it's a word.  We're talking about the word.  It's just a word.  I know, but the whole thing...  I'm not calling anybody it.  I know.  I know.  But the thing happened, you know, you guys, you were here.  You didn't see it.  I mean, I was in Los Angeles. 
[03:33:00]  The time in South Central, all of the sudden, everybody, they're trying to have a riot and  all of that stuff happening.  You've got to do the best you can do.  Stop it.  So are you doing this for self-preservation?  Is this pretty much, please look, I'm trying, don't burn my club down?  No, no, no, no.  It's not only that.  Or is it a personal decision that you're actually making through your own morality or something?  Yeah, because we can't start banning words there.  No, we can't.  No, wait, no, no.  We can't start banning the word.  No, no, no.  I'm not banning a word or anything like that whatsoever. 
[03:33:30]  What I'm trying to say, we've got to, as a comedy community, we've got to come together  somehow, you know, calm the whole thing down because it sounds sense to all of the people,  all of the sudden out there.  They're all ready to do the riot.  Oh, come on, still angry about a sitcom guy from years ago who said a bad word to a heckler  trying to hurt him.  And then it really fell apart on television over and over again with Al Sharpton and Jesse 
[03:34:00]  Jackson and David Letterman.  I mean, if they're really ready to riot, if they're going to riot, they would have already  rioted.  No, they were going to riot.  But they're not going to riot now.  No, no, they were going riot.  I mean, at the time we were, day before Thanksgiving, I was on the Stevie Wonder's radio, a bunch  of places.  There were 5,000, 6,000 people that were outside.  They were all kind of like a, it was like a dynamite.  It was ready to blow up.  Right.  And so what we do, we have to do something because in Los Angeles, these people, there 
[03:34:30]  are a lot of people that are unemployed.  There are a lot of people that don't have no jobs or anything in South Central.  And they were, it was just going crazy.  So what do you do at that point?  You got to do something the best you can do, calm everything down.  I think, I think you calm things down though by telling Michael Richards maybe that he can't  perform there anymore because it was more, not, not so much for the language, but just  for like the outburst and the turning away of, of your clientele.  You know, he turned away people from your club. 
[03:35:00]  That is a reason for you to say, hey, you're not welcome back here anymore.  But for using words, I mean, it's like if, if Mencia comes in and says, beaner, beaner,  beaner, uh, is, are you going to ban him?  Is it, is it something like that?  No, no, no.  I mean, none of that, you know, no, but you know, the whole thing is what we trying to  do.  The time you see the whole thing happening, what's happening in, again, in Los Angeles,  you guys all see it from outside.  The time I was involved with it, the time I saw it in Los Angeles.  Well, I can nigger out what's going on out there. 
[03:35:30]  I just, it's hard to figure out.  I can figure out what's going on out there just by, uh, what I hear in the news.  Oh, they're applauding you outside.  Things like that, but, uh, I'm sorry.  It was just a Freudian sliver.  But, uh, you know, I don't think it's as bad.  I'm there.  Again, I'm not out there.  Well, I'm there too.  It's not where we're going.  But, you guys, you are all, you know, everybody, Joe Rogan, everybody, they are there.  They're living in Beverly Hills, Brentwood.  I don't live in Beverly Hills.  Oh, okay, wherever.  You're not living in South Central. 
[03:36:00]  The time you go in the South Central.  If I lived in South Central, would it make more sense?  I think you would be agreeing with me if you leave there.  I think Jamie is afraid of his club.  This is why I didn't hate that you banned it.  I didn't look at it like it was a political correct decision.  I think he just didn't want his club to be a focal point of this rage with that big insignia on the side.  And that's an area that has a history of really shitty racial violence.  And, look, if I owned a building, I just don't want people fucking Molotov cocktailing it.  I mean, so that's the only reason I kind of decided with you on that. 
[03:36:30]  I don't think banning a word, I think it's a disgraceful part.  To preserve your club from being burnt down, you know, you got to do something.  Here's how it could have been stopped way, way earlier.  Why didn't you get rid of those fuckheads when they were heckling other people?  Weren't they heckling other people all night?  No, no, they was not.  That's what I heard from other comics.  No, I was always there.  Nobody else?  You're just hearing all people, they're exaggerating.  I was there.  The guys, they were ordering drinks.  By the time, a couple of days, they were talking.  I was right there.  And one of the guys, and Michael looked at the people. 
[03:37:00]  He said, what's going on in here?  And the guy said, nothing.  And Michael kept on asking, what's going on?  Why are you talking?  And the guy, he said, hey, my buddy thinks you are not funny.  He said, what?  He said, my buddy said, you are not funny.  And at that point, the rages came in.  And, you know, comics, they are, you know, I mean, all of you guys know you're coming from  insecurity.  You're coming from, you need a lot of love on the stage.  And that's what it is about.  And at that point, it's like you make fun of the guy's shirt.  You could talk about his big head. 
[03:37:30]  That's the thing.  Like, you're saying, it's like, you should never do what he did.  You should never do that.  No, no.  Because he's so incompetent.  That's what it really is.  It was.  It was.  And, dude, it's like, if you're bombing, that's what happens in comedy.  People say you're not funny.  And then you have to deal with it.  Right.  What you don't do is what he did was fucking wrong.  Well, I had heard from, he had did a set at the comedy store before he went up at the  Laugh Factory.  And the guys who saw him at the comedy store, my friend Brian was talking about it, saying  he was like a different guy. 
[03:38:00]  He was like yelling and screaming and swearing.  He just seemed like all amped up.  You had a chick with him, right?  I heard you had a chick with him.  That might explain why that rage came out, because there's nothing worse than bombing in  front of a girl.  You know why that chick?  It's fucking embarrassing.  She's living at Poe's house.  Oh.  She's being protective.  She's in a cage right now.  Wouldn't it help with the Laugh Factory, though, if they wanted to cut the problem, if they  just banned black patrons?  Yeah.  That's an option.  I mean, I don't.  You call a white guy a nigger, they very rarely even flinch.  I don't think so. 
[03:38:30]  Any of that would have been fair.  He's actually answering it.  No, I don't think that would actually be the right way to do it.  Buddy, that's not the way to handle it.  I got a question.  Start slower.  Drinking fountains in bathrooms.  Four different restrooms.  No, but, you know, the whole thing was the time this whole rage went on.  And all of this, and I didn't know what to do.  And all I did, I mean, after 28 years of being in the business, I decided I'd give everybody's  money back.  And a lot of people, they start taking advantage of a lot of opportunities that were there.  Yep. 
[03:39:00]  You know, a guy coming in, he said, I have $400 worth of drinks.  I said, $400 worth of drinks?  You drank them?  I said, I mean, $400.  I said, show me the bill.  He showed me a knife.  I said, okay, here's $400.  He showed you a knife?  Yeah.  I mean, I wish you were there that night.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  The guy pulled a knife on you?  Yeah.  Why didn't you call the police?  Here's my bill.  Because at that time, it was going to be a riot.  Yeah, right there.  I mean, all of you guys, you're seeing outside, you're seeing from outside, you don't see  what was going on up there.  It was amazing.  Stuff was happening. 
[03:39:30]  All of a sudden, a lot of people, the opportunists, they are standing up there.  They're looking at everything.  It just doesn't make sense.  For you guys, you know, sitting up here, why don't you, at that point, if by the time  I'll call the cops and that and that and that.  Listen, it's pandemonium.  I totally understand.  I totally understand you giving people their money back, apologizing.  I totally understand you banning Michael Richards.  I totally understand all that.  I just don't understand you printing receipts on knives.  No.  You're going to fucking move.  Handing out a Laugh Factory knife. 
[03:40:00]  Complimentary Laugh Factory switchblade.  A lot of engraving going on.  Thank God.  Paul Mooney will carry it around.  Oh, please, homie.  Put the knife away, homie.  Of course, Paul Mooney get on all of that.  And Jesse Jackson and all of those guys, they're all coming.  We're going on a radio show with them.  All of them, they have their hands out.  Oh, you've got to do something for my church.  Well, Paul Mooney, I think, made a great point.  He said the guy had a nervous breakdown.  I think that's exactly what it was.  He's just not a funny guy.  I mean, that's the reality of it. 
[03:40:30]  He got all that love all those years from those sitcoms.  Look, man, I've been in that fucking world from news radio.  I've seen those people.  They want their bagels and their smoked locks and they're there at the table read and everyone's  clapping and laughing and there's all this extra love and everyone waves to them on the  red carpet and it's a bullshit world.  Yeah.  And you go from that bullshit world to the fucking trenches of Saturday night in front  of drunks at a comedy club.  Dude, that's a different animal, man.  And it's his words coming out of his mouth, not Larry David's or Jerry Seinfeld or the  writers. 
[03:41:00]  Not only is it his words, he doesn't have that much time on stage.  He's only been doing time.  I mean, how long has he been doing comedy?  About six months, seven months.  No, no.  He's been doing it longer than that.  I've seen him at the comedy store several years ago.  No, no, no.  He came in, but he came in, he stopped.  He came in for one month, two months.  He's been doing it in other places.  He's been doing it in other places.  Because I saw him at the improv at least a year ago.  So he's been scattered back and forth going on stage.  But the bottom line is the guy is up at one of the biggest stages in the country as far  as stand-up goes.  You know, you're going there, you're going to go up after all these major national acts 
[03:41:30]  who are going to fucking slay.  And then you're going up basically an open miker who's a superstar multimillionaire.  And on top of it, he's got this fucking tremendous attitude.  You know, I mean, you know, the shit that he said was just, that's insanity.  I mean, you can't say that.  I mean, none of it makes any sense.  I mean, you know, someone doesn't think you're funny, so you're going to hang them up by  their ankles and stick a fork in their ass.  And look, I found a nigger.  None of that makes any sense.  I thought the funniest part was in the middle of it where he tried to turn it around and  try to play it like he was trying to teach people something. 
[03:42:00]  Hey, they're just words.  Oh, those words.  We're still, it's like, no, dude, you fucking snapped.  You snapped.  Yeah, and that was in your mind.  Mooney hit it the best.  Mooney said he had a nervous breakdown.  And in a way he did.  He did in a point, he did have an nervous breakdown.  And then he want to come in to talk to the people.  Did you let him on stage the next night?  No.  He told me he want to come in next night to go apologize.  I said, OK, Michael, come in.  And CNN, they came in with a camera. 
[03:42:30]  Jennifer Wolf came in with a CNN.  They wanted to have him on the stage to apologize.  He went on the stage and he was on the stage for five, six minutes.  He didn't apologize.  We gave him red light.  And you know what's the red light?  People, they don't know out there.  He didn't apologize.  What did he do?  And he ran off the stage and he went to Jennifer.  He said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  And Jennifer said, we wanted you to say it on the camera.  He said, no.  And he ran out of the door.  That's the end of it.  So he went on stage.  What did he talk about for six minutes?  Did he stand up?  About four or five minutes.  He just went. 
[03:43:00]  What's the deal?  You know, I mean.  Yeah, what did he do?  This is an interesting question.  But he went on.  He was nervous.  And I think he was doing some of the jokes.  But he was.  I mean, the time he goes on the stage.  First of all, you know, Joe, because you've been into it because you were a star.  And you're a star.  The time you go on the stage, people, they go crazy because of you go on the stage.  And he went on the stage for five minutes, three minute people.  They went crazy to see him.  And I went crazy to see him. 
[03:43:30]  Did they know about the night before?  Oh, no, no.  Yes, some of them they do.  Some of them they do.  Did anybody boo him?  Not really.  Not really.  They were waiting for him to apologize.  You know.  And then all of a sudden, he got off the stage.  He ran off the stage.  Oh, man.  He blew it.  You know, it was.  He should have checked into rehab.  I would have said I was on a fucking pound of coke.  DMT.  Don't you remember that night?  I'm pissing blood.  You put Velcro on the ceiling.  The last thing you said.  You wet their lips and stick them to the wall.  Nothing, people. 
[03:44:00]  Three, if you slice them thin enough.  Don't you think banning words, though, sets a real bad precedent for club owners?  No, I don't.  You know, it's just like a pro.  You know, I mean, again, all of you guys know I'm in this.  You're in a tough position, though, because the other races are going to come out and say,  well, you've got to ban spick and you've got to ban this word.  You've got to ban that.  Goop.  Chink.  Faggot.  What about hacks? 
[03:44:30]  How about ban hacks first?  Ban hacks.  Yeah, no.  What it really is is you can't say that shit in anger, like just deliberately trying to piss.  I get a way around that is if someone does that, you don't fuck them again.  No, but it's not like people are thinking, he's dealing with the fucking media circuit.  He's got to do something.  He's also got to deal with the fact that 20 Asians aren't going to come to his place if someone says chink  and stab him with chopsticks.  But in certain situations in the area you're in, there is an element that might be a little angry 
[03:45:00]  and riled to the point where they might do some physical damage.  Jamie, what about Black Knight?  You do a Black Knight over there, right?  Yeah, we do a Chocolate Sunday.  So how are we going to do that?  Chocolate Sunday.  Chocolate Sunday?  You're doing a Chocolate Sunday, they're not allowed to say the N-word?  Yes.  And what...  No.  That's never going to work, dude.  That's hilarious.  That's so fucking hard.  I bet the first guy gets up there.  Oh, please, Sunday.  No, no, no, no, no.  Homie's delusional.  Even Paul Mooney came in on Wednesday night. 
[03:45:30]  Paul Mooney came last week.  His act was three minutes long.  No, he did not use one word.  How about that Elizabeth Taylor?  Oh, please, homie.  That Negroes is crazy.  Why did the cameras leave?  Oh, homie, stop.  I'm ready for my cursor.  African-American, please.  But I just got to finish what...  Ready for my N-word wake-up call.  You know, one thing I'm going to say is it was like, you know, pro sports,  they say you've got to be nice to a fan if you are going to be a little bit crazy.  I don't think those guys were his fans.  Well, you know, the people that come in in the club, they are comedy fans. 
[03:46:00]  Comedy fans.  Definitely not Michael Richie fans.  No, I want to say, I mean, every other people that come in in the club,  they shouldn't use the word because of...  We say if you do it, we take some of your money from your paycheck,  we give it to charity.  That's what we're going to try to do.  And that's right now calming people down.  You've got to do something.  You can't just, you know, say, no, we are not going to do it.  But wait a minute, you get like 50 bucks a set or something.  What do you get a set of the left hand?  It's 75.  How much money is it?  Comedy store, they rip you off, those cocksuckers.  I never got a check from anybody in L.A. 
[03:46:30]  I never got paid in L.A.  I don't get paid in L.A.  You never got paid from Laugh Factory?  No, from no one.  No one's ever paid me in L.A.  Oh, you better go in cashier booths.  Always your check is there.  Buddy, it's ready for you.  So somebody, let's say someone gets on stage.  Unless one of the black people steal.  No, no.  Someone gets on stage.  Let me hang them by.  In a very comedic context.  Yes.  They use the word nigger.  And it's going to happen.  How much is it going to cost?  One of the boys are going to do that.  First, it's going to take their paycheck or to a charity.  Their whole paycheck.  A whole paycheck.  So how much money is that? 
[03:47:00]  75 dollars.  75 bucks.  Yes.  If you blurt that word out.  It's worth it if you get a good laugh.  And what if you say it twice?  Does that affect your next set?  Yeah.  Then you're going to be, for three months, you won't be able to come back to the Laugh Factory.  That's crazy.  That's what you're going to say.  So first time you find them, then the second time they're three months off.  Yeah.  Hold on.  But it's so worth it.  There's a comedian out there that's going to do it just for the exposure.  What about he's going to be the guy that breaks the ban and he's going to be all over  seeing it?  Have you ever done something similar to this for guys who steal material? 
[03:47:30]  I've done that for many times.  You know that.  Does the men see you perform at your club all the time?  Not true.  Hello.  Hello.  Don't even go there.  You know that.  Doesn't he?  No.  You stopped him?  No.  From first day.  Come on.  What?  You know better than that.  Come on.  You know better than that.  You work in college.  You work in college.  So with you.  Oh, dude.  Come on, man.  He's there.  He goes there.  Yeah, but you know, not in, you know, most of the people, they do anything like that.  What about Dane?  What about Dane? 
[03:48:00]  Dane Cook.  What about him stealing people's material?  Dane, he does not steal anything.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  That's hilarious.  Go on the internet.  Go on the internet.  Go on the internet and watch all the videos, listen to all the people talk about it.  You ever see the Louis C.K. clips?  Yeah.  When Louis C.K. was working out his material for his HBO special and Dane did three of his  bits on a CD?  Blatantly?  I, again, again, who took from who?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Dane takes from everybody.  No.  Stop.  Louis C.K. doesn't steal from anybody.  I've never heard Louis C.K.  No.  Louis C.K. is a great comedian. 
[03:48:30]  I've never heard any.  I love Louis C.K.  Not one person ever say that he steals from anybody.  Every comic that I know says Dane Cook steals.  No, Dane Cook, I have not seen something.  Buddy, just because he's your number one guy, buddy, does not mean he does not care.  No, no, no, no.  Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.  Buddy, tell the truth.  Joe, Joe, that is one thing.  Don't speak with fucking tongue.  No, I tell you something.  Dane Cook, he's a most hardworking guy.  Yes, very hardworking, very ambitious.  And let me tell you, everybody jealous of him.  They're trying to get the undercat. 
[03:49:00]  Very true.  Oh, he's this, he's this.  Okay, what else you can come in?  Because he have number one record.  He have number one, everything.  But what?  They've always said he was a thief way before that.  No, no.  Yes, they did.  As soon as he made it, everybody jealous.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Way, way before.  That's not true.  I never heard of it.  No.  As soon as he made it.  Jim, have you ever heard of this?  I have heard.  Well, the problem was when the clips showed up online, it got to be ugly because between  Louis and Dane, the clips were there.  And it was like, oof.  It's obvious.  But it's not just him. 
[03:49:30]  It's Jim Brewer.  He's stolen from me.  He's stolen from a million different comics in L.A.  I don't like that cutting at times.  Like you said, Chappelle, I mean, when comics make it, a lot of times comics aren't jealous.  No comics were ever jealous of a band about Dave Attell or Louis Black.  There's a lot of guys that make it.  Or CK or Chappelle.  I mean, Chappelle's enormous.  Chappelle's a good example because he's stolen from Steele.  Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody says he steals ever.  Everyone says Dane steals.  Yeah, but let me explain something.  You're not telling the truth.  I'm telling the truth.  No, you're not.  Bro, but it's not true.  It's not a truth.  I'm not saying you're a liar, but I'm saying you might not be aware of it. 
[03:50:00]  It's definitely not true.  You might not, I mean, the only thing I'm saying, as soon as I see his record, his CD came number one, and he went on the chart.  He became, after Steve Martin, he was the first person going up the chart.  Nobody ever done it.  And everybody got jealous.  Everybody started calling.  Well, but that doesn't mean anything.  You're avoiding the point.  No, I'm not avoiding something.  He did do a tremendous thing, and he was very successful, but the fact remains, he stole material. 
[03:50:30]  No, I...  On that CD, he took stuff from Louis C.K.'s HBO special from years before.  That's a fact.  But, yeah, show it to me.  Show it to me.  I mean, I, I, I, you know, I, when you say, come on, Jamie.  You're a great diplomat, by the way.  Hey, Joe, where is it online?  You are.  No, I'm not.  You can find it online.  I mean, anybody can check it out.  I think you can go to redband.com.  I think he's got it up.  I think, you know, there's a whole, a Radar magazine is printing.  He's doing an article right now about him stealing.  There's, like, a bunch of, he's been accused of it on CNN, had a whole thing about comics 
[03:51:00]  saying that he steals.  I mean, it's all over the place.  Where there's smoke, there's fire.  I've never met a single comic ever that people say steals that doesn't steal.  Have you?  Have you?  Bill?  Have you ever met a guy that everybody says is a thief, and you see the guy and goes,  no, this guy's completely original.  I've never heard one.  The thing I remember was guys, and I'm not going to say names, but just one guy who made  it, and it's just everybody where I was at was saying, this guy took for me, this  guy took for me, this guy took.  And I was looking at their acts, and I was, it was, I didn't see it. 
[03:51:30]  Well, who is this?  This doesn't make sense unless you give us context.  Yeah, if you didn't think he was a thief, you could say it.  Yeah, Leary.  Like, everyone's saying, Leary took it.  Oh, dude.  The Hick stuff?  The Hick stuff is pretty good.  I don't know anything about it.  I'm just saying that there were guys.  Well, you never listened to the Hick stuff, then.  There were guys.  I saw Leary steal over and over again back in Boston, early in the 80s, in the late 80s,  rather, the early 90s.  I saw it.  I saw it with my own eyes over and over and over again.  I saw him do Ray Romano's material.  I saw him do Tony V's material.  I saw it with my own eyes, in clubs.  I saw him do Bill Hicks' material verbatim.  Then I saw Bill Hicks do the same material a month later, and I was baffled. 
[03:52:00]  I was an open-miker.  And I said, what the fuck is going on?  What I saw was guys who stunk in their acts.  Nobody would steal from, were walking around saying it.  Okay, that's, I'm sure there's a lot of that.  Of course there's delusional people.  I never saw it.  That's delusional, yes.  Of course there's that, but the fact remains, that guy's a thief.  That's a fact.  Leary, for sure, I've seen it over and over again.  I saw it with my own eyes.  I mean, he doesn't anymore, but if you look at the difference between, you look at his  first No Cure for Cancer, then look at Locked and Loaded, pre and post Hicks being dead. 
[03:52:30]  Dude, there's a monstrous difference in the level of the material.  The material post Hicks being dead is fucking horrible.  The stuff that he did before, when No Cure for Cancer is some brilliant shit.  It's a completely different thing, because he was taking the ideas from someone else.  That is a fact.  Yeah, but Joe, if I can say something here, you're very fast to jump in a conclusion of  somebody.  Do you know why?  Do you know why?  Because I've been the victim of it, and I've seen it happen over and over again, and because 
[03:53:00]  I work very hard on my material, and I write a lot, and I sit in front of my fucking computer  for hours on end, and then I go to the comedy store, and I have little pieces of paper,  and I go over it in my head, which bitch am I going to do?  I'm going to go into that, and then I go into that, and I work on this shit over and  over and over again for months, and then some fucking douchebag goes up, he sees me  kill with some bit, and then he reworks it, and then he goes on stage, and you know what?  Club owners don't do shit about it, and then they get on here on a radio show, and they  say, no one steals, he doesn't steal, he doesn't steal, and it's not true.  You haven't looked into it at all, and you're defending someone who is widely known throughout 
[03:53:30]  the country as being a thief through the fucking comedy community.  You talk to club owners, you talk to people in HBO, you talk to people everywhere that I  talk to people, they know he steals.  Okay, let me explain something.  It doesn't mean you telling me you thought of a material, doesn't mean somebody else,  if you thought of building a helicopter, and doesn't mean another person, another place  does not be able to see.  There is a thing called parallel thinking, yes.  I've had that happen to me. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, but you can't not see.  I've had that happen too.  I had that happen recently, we were just talking about it, a buddy of mine in LA said,  dude, I got this bid, it's like your bid.  I go, don't even worry about it, you know, I know you're not a thief, you know, if you  know a guy's not a thief, it's like you don't even have the conversation, you know, if you  got a comic that you know you respect, like, dude, it's a fucking common, it's something  happened in the news, and you thought about something, and I thought about something,  and they're similar.  But I think sometimes if people are already jealous of a guy's success, and then that  parallel thinking happens, it just becomes, once you get to a certain level, it immediately  becomes, he's a thief, he's a thief.  Without a doubt.  There are definitely crabs in a bucket. 
[03:54:30]  Thank you.  However, with the Dane Cook thing, they were calling him a thief.  They were calling him a thief for years, years ago they were calling him a thief.  I was, I had a problem with him way back when, he was doing one of my bits on Premium Blend,  he did my bit about tigers fucking on the Discovery Channel, he changed it to Rhinos,  I called him up, he told me his own fucking agent told him to stop doing the bit, and he  was going to stop doing it.  Then I came to the Laugh Factory, and he's doing one of my other bits on stage, I confronted  him, and that was the last time I worked at the Laugh Factory.  I don't work there anymore, because I didn't want to go up in front of him, and see him 
[03:55:00]  doing my shit, and have him go up and do it, but I never thought Dane was going to make  it.  I, like, a lot of people thought that Dane was, like, a mediocre comic.  I mean, he's a fantastic self-salesman, a great marketer, a genius strategist as far  as, like, marketing himself and promoting himself.  I mean, you've got to give the guy massive amounts of credit for that tireless worker  in that regard, but I never thought he was very funny.  So I didn't, I didn't worry about the repercussions of him stealing material.  I heard it from everybody over and over again.  The comics were saying that he's stealing their shit, he's telling them to stop doing 
[03:55:30]  bits that they've been doing for years, because that's their bit, and he's going to sue them.  I mean, I heard it from everybody.  You've heard it, we've all heard it.  It's like, it's not because the guy got famous, that's bullshit.  He was getting this reputation long before.  For sure, there's crabs in a bucket, and for sure, there's, when people get famous, people  try to drag them down.  But that's not what's going on here.  Yeah, but again, you've got to look at it the way I'm looking at it.  Yeah, you look at it as a club owner, and he puts asses in your seat.  No, no.  That's how you're looking at it.  That's not, that's not, that's, he's not, he's not, that's not the reason.  Come on, what's the reason? 
[03:56:00]  He's been working there 12 years.  Right.  And a lot of people, they came to me.  The same time he came with a joke, another person came out with a joke.  The joke you're talking about, Discovery, and Tigers, and all of that.  Everybody can do that joke, and you're saying to me, well, somebody see that joke, it cannot  be done, another person cannot do it.  I got a call from Jim Brewer, Jim Brewer was working with Dane Cook in Canada, and Jim Brewer  called me up, and he goes, dude, dude, fucking Dane Cook's doing your material, verbatim, 
[03:56:30]  in Canada, seven, eight years ago, it was a long time ago, and then I heard he did it  on Premium Blend, and that's when I called him up, and I think, Dane and I used to be friends,  I was friends with that guy, he used to open up for me back in Boston when he was with  Al and the Monkees, he was in a sketch group, and I've known him for a long time, and he's  always had that reputation, he's always had.  On that CD, there's three bits from this Louis C.K. HBO special that are nearly word for  word, he'll change one word, and it's almost exactly the same.  Dude, I'm a huge comedy fan, and I love it when people make it, and I love being inspired,  I love watching good comedy, and I'm not one that believes that if someone becomes successful, 
[03:57:00]  that means that other people aren't successful.  I think that there's enough success out there for everybody, and I want everybody to be  huge, I mean, I want everybody who's a great comic to get out there and have a bunch of  people enjoy their work, but that's not what's going on here.  Well, to me, again, maybe some of, a lot of stuff, I'm not saying you, a lot of comics  that I spoke to, I see they're coming from jealousy.  You think Louis C.K. is coming from jealousy?  I don't know, Louis C.K., for example, one of the jokes that he particularly talks about, 
[03:57:30]  I've seen it, Dane Cook was working on the stage much before Louis C.K.  How long, how long?  I don't know, about maybe eight, nine months before Louis C.K.  Yeah, Louis had those jokes for about six years.  Okay, six years.  And Dane's seen those jokes.  But you don't know if Dane's seen it, or he saw it on the TV, or sometimes it came in.  Or you're saying, oh, he went and he took the...  He saw him, Louis was in the audience, and Louis was on stage, and Dane was in the audience.  Louis talked to Dane after he did sets.  He talks about it, about how Dane saw him do the material. 
[03:58:00]  Again, again, we all make an acquisition without, you know...  No, no, no, no, no, we're not.  We're not making an acquisition.  Let's have Louis and Dane start talking to each other, say this has happened.  You're saying stuff...  Why are you defending him?  Why are you openly defending him?  Because I'm openly defending him because I think a lot of people, they came to the club.  I'm the only club.  You're the only club?  I'm the only club.  The only club?  What do you mean?  The only club are banned people. 
[03:58:30]  If Carlos Mancio, any of that stuff, Paul Mooney came in, said Carlos Mancio did his jokes.  I was in Laugh Factory, I said, Carlos, you cannot do that anymore.  But he still performs at your club?  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't ever perform at your club?  Except...  I don't know if he does.  No, no, only one time he came.  Come on, he wasn't there recently?  No, he came one time with a showcase for the...  What was that?  Okay, well, I'm being lied to them because someone told me they saw him here very recently and they've seen him at your club a couple times.  Well, I mean, if they've seen him, I don't know. 
[03:59:00]  But personally...  So it's when you're not there that he performs?  No, I mean, I'm there all the time.  But if they come there...  Okay, so you're admitting that Carlos steals.  You know Carlos steals?  I don't know Carlos.  Again, Carlos...  But let me explain.  I admit it.  I admit it, Carlos.  Let me explain it to you with Carlos.  Carlos, I admit it...  Call him by a slave name.  Okay, okay.  Call him Ned.  Ned, or whatever, whatever.  The whole thing is, I'm just trying to say, I saw Carlos and George Lopez, they were upstairs, they were, you know, almost killing each other.  I was actually in the lobby when George Lopez grabbed him by the neck and threw him up. 
[03:59:30]  No, it wasn't in the lobby, it was upstairs in my club.  It was upstairs.  I thought it was in the pot, bro.  No, no, no, no.  It might have happened more than once.  Yeah, I mean, well, again, again, I mean, I saw it.  I saw it, you know, I tried to...  What happened with Lopez and Carlos?  I don't get all the skinny...  Lopez, Carlos stole all of Lopez's shit and did it on his HBO special.  Carlos is more subtle about his stealing now, but in the early days, it was fucking horrible.  It was just blatant, verbatim, just giant chunks of material.  He's not a creative guy.  I mean, if you talk to the guy, he's not very intelligent, he doesn't have an unusual point of view, and he just steals. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, so him and Lopez had a beef in the club?  Yeah, he's had a beef in everybody, bro.  Mooney, Lopez...  You know, I mean, I've seen a lot of people, they get in a fight and everything, and the time they came in, to me, they told me,  about it, and I'll find out if they did it.  Then I'll try to react on it and do whatever I can.  And to come in to tell me, oh, as soon as somebody make it, and everybody jealous, and trying to put him down, I...  I'll say something about Louie, though. 
[04:00:30]  Louie did not push...  I will say this, because I know Louie well.  He didn't push that issue.  He actually...  We were talking about it one time on the set, and he's like, nah, man, I don't want to get into it and talk about it publicly,  just because then it seems like you're bashing the guy who's getting famous.  So Louie actually tried to be very low-key about the whole thing.  He tried to be big about it.  Yeah, I had a conversation with him about it, and I said, dude, you're not going to come off bitter if you're just honest about it.  You don't have to, you know, just, you don't have to, like, let a guy get away with something like that.  You can talk about it and not come off bitter. 
[04:01:00]  It is possible.  Yeah, but again, okay, everything, all right, he stole this, he stole that.  But everything he's made so far, he made his movie, became number one, this became number one.  This is all he stole.  He stole everything.  No, bro, we're not talking about the fucking movies, man.  We're talking about comedy.  Yeah, we're talking about comedy and everything.  You're making it like it's not a big deal.  A lot of times people don't always stole until they see these CDs that become number one on the charts.  Once they see it, once it's out there, they're like, oh, that's good.  The real thing about Dane is Dane would have made it without stealing. 
[04:01:30]  Dane made it because he's brutally ambitious, and he's a very smart guy.  He's a talented, too.  A very talented performer.  Yeah, thank you.  I believe all that.  Yeah, but you're not.  All right, I'm back.  I'm sorry.  Louis C.K., Dane Cook.  Got some audio.  Because you haven't heard this yet, right?  Let's see it.  Yeah, please.  All right, let's see if you have a comment.  So this is Louis C.K., obviously.  Listen closely.  One time I saw a guy in a bicycle, and he was about to get hit with a car door. 
[04:02:00]  It was horrible.  And he wasn't looking, and the lady opening the door wasn't looking.  It was just for me.  And I didn't know what to do.  I was like, ah, like I wanted to yell something, but what do you yell?  And I'm trying to, like if time slows down, I'm trying to choose the thing to yell that  will have all the information that he needs.  Because it was happening really fast.  I had like that much time to yell, you know.  What can I yell in that much time?  Hey, you're the guy to buy you.  No, no, no, that's not.  Chicken over the guy, shit.  I just yelled out, bad thing! 
[04:02:30]  Wasn't really specific enough.  Oh, well.  So there you have it, Louis C.K.  Now, what's that from?  You know offhand, Joe?  Oh, it's, I don't know.  Is it one of those HBO specials, or is it a CD?  This goes back a while.  It's a long time ago.  I saw Louis do that years ago.  I actually don't know.  It was like 2000.  It's like from 2001, they're saying.  All right.  And now here's Dane Cook.  Three weeks ago, one of my dreams came true.  I finally got to see something I've always wanted to witness live. 
[04:03:00]  I finally saw someone get hit by a car.  I did try to help this man.  As the car was coming towards him, I reached out.  And I said, oh!  Oh!  That's all I could think of to say.  There's so many things now, in retrospect, that I would love to have been like,  You're about to get struck by a vehicle!  I did not have time to say, you're about to get struck by a vehicle.  So I went with, oh! 
[04:03:30]  Which is like a concerned moan.  That's from 2005.  Okay.  Can I comment on that?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  We're playing it for you.  Okay.  That particular thing.  I know Dane Cook.  He came to me.  He said he saw an accident really happen.  Now, you guys coming up say, because of, you know, it was recorded so much.  If something happened to somebody.  Dude, he saw that bit.  That's the same bit.  No, he saw this accident happen. 
[04:04:00]  That's all well and good.  You see an accident doesn't mean you're allowed to take someone's bit to describe the accident.  And that's what he did.  He described it exactly the same way he saw Louis C. G. describe it.  That's a stolen bit.  Well, to me, the time he described the accident happened to him.  That doesn't mean anything.  That does mean to somebody.  No, it doesn't mean anything.  Because if something happened to you, Joe Rogan, if somebody punched you in the face or something,  and you're going to talk about it, you can't say.  Are you threatening me?  You can't say, no, I, no, no, no.  Are you falling apart here, Jamie?  No, no.  I mean, I'm saying somebody, somebody did. 
[04:04:30]  Jamie, you're falling apart here, right?  No, no.  That's a stolen bit.  No, it's not.  Can we get a consensus here?  How many people believe that was a stolen bit?  It's very close, man.  Yeah, it's pretty close.  If everyone in the peanut gallery just raised their hands, everyone out there?  Still birds, is that a stolen bit?  If something happens to you, I see people on stage, and they'll do a bit.  I'll be like, oh, my God, the same stuff happened exactly to me.  Dude, I had a bit one time, and I swear to God, another guy came out.  He had a bit, and it was like fucking the setup that we had.  And we're like, word for fucking word, and I got all paranoid. 
[04:05:00]  I started to invent this conspiracy, like, this guy's on a TV show.  He had writers, and they were in this Chinese restaurant that I was performing in out in  fucking Worcester, and they saw it.  And then I just, after a while, I just realized that, like.  That is possible.  Parallel thinking.  We already discussed that.  Yeah, me and.  But this is not a case of parallel thinking.  Me and Greg Geraldo had a bit about.  Again, we're talking about six years before.  And during those years, and before that, he was doing the bit.  Before he recorded it in 2001, he was doing that bit before.  And he's been doing it.  And then Dane comes along and puts it on a CD in 2005. 
[04:05:30]  You don't think he saw that?  Joe.  You know what the thing is?  People definitely steal.  They definitely swipe shit.  They definitely switch shit up.  But actually fucking proving it is what sucks.  Oh, sure.  Absolutely.  Because people rewrite things.  They steal premises and rewrite.  They're being paranoid, Joey.  Jamie, there's nothing paranoid about that.  It is paranoid about that, Jamie, there's nothing paranoid about what you just heard.  No, because I heard the other part of the story.  You don't want to face it.  The other part of the story doesn't mean anything.  The guy, he was almost in an accent. 
[04:06:00]  You don't want to hear that.  You want to hear what happened.  Okay, let's look at it this way.  You know Chris Rock's joke about tossing your salad?  You know that joke he does about watching that prison show?  Now, what if I watched the same prison show, and I go on stage and do a joke very similar  about tossing your salad?  Even though I know Chris Rock had done that joke for five fucking years about tossing your  salad.  That would be stealing material, Jamie.  That's what that is.  Okay, let me explain that.  Even though I saw the show, even though I saw the same show he saw, it's still stealing 
[04:06:30]  material.  When you know another guy did the exact same fucking thing.  Yeah, that's that rule of who got there first.  Okay, no, no.  I understand.  It's the same setup.  All right, listen.  That could have been parallel thinking.  Let's go to another.  You think so?  Can I make it one comment?  No, I mean, what do you think?  No, it's way too close.  It's stealing, right?  You think it's stealing?  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  Anthony, what do you think?  Joe, we have a soft spot for this because in radio, the same shit happens to us all the  time.  Okay, can I say something?  Let's put another example out.  Let's see what happens. 
[04:07:00]  Here's another example.  You have to say, too.  I never jumped on a Danish stealing bandwagon.  I know a lot of people attack somebody when a guy's getting...  You have to see how many instances it happens in.  If you hear one bit and you go, like, it was one bit.  Absolutely, because there is something that can be very close on one bit.  If you have an open mind, all right, fine.  Parallels.  Let's try another one.  But you guys don't know...  Let's try another one.  Let's try another one.  Okay, you don't want to listen to me.  Here's Louis C.K.  What do you do?  Well, you'll have your say.  Hold on.  Okay, thank you.  Here's another example.  Louis C.K. first.  My wife and I were thinking of having a baby and...  I'd like to have a kid because you can name your kid anything you want. 
[04:07:30]  I like that part.  I'd like to give my kid an interesting name, you know?  Like a name with no vowels, maybe, you know?  Just like...  Just like 40 Fs.  That's his name.  Go clean your room, you know?  Something like that. 
[04:08:00]  All right, so that's Louis C.K. from 2001.  Louis is a fucking original guy, man.  Louis is a very out-there, original guy.  Yeah, weird.  All right, here's Dane Cook.  Very weird.  I'd love to have some kids.  I've been thinking about kids.  I want to have, like, 19 kids.  I think naming them, that's going to be fun.  Whatever the names that you come up with, that's exciting right there.  You get to both decide, hey, do you want to name that?  No, I don't like that name.  It's like a little game.  You try to come up.  I already have names picked out.  I don't even know.  First kid, boy, girl.  I don't care.  The first one that comes out, I'm naming it. 
[04:08:30]  I think it's beautiful.  It's feminine but strong at the same time.  Time for bed.  I said time for bed.  No cookies.  Typical.  Oh, boy.  Well, what do you have to say about that one?  This is what I'll say here.  This is what I'll say now.  Same CD.  One can happen.  I don't know.  This is, you know, where there's smoke, there's fire. 
[04:09:00]  Look, I used to like the guy, too, until he stole from me.  It's not an uncommon discussion amongst comedians.  That's almost word for word, Jamie.  What do you got to say?  Okay, let me explain something, you guys.  We wouldn't be surprised if you just start yelling nigger a lot.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop even going there.  75 bucks, Dopey.  75 bucks.  Why are you going there?  Why are you going there?  Why are you going there?  Why are you going there?  Why are you going there?  Why are you going there?  Why are you going there?  Okay, let me explain.  Yeah, we'll see.  We're going to watch it.  Let me tell you.  Let's let Jamie.  Blurring that word out was a lot cheaper back in the 1800s. 
[04:09:30]  Jamie, you're good friend.  Okay, let me.  Dane Cook is one thing about Dane Cook.  He goes up there.  He talks.  He's not like a comedian that go write the material.  And he like accent happened.  Like the time he goes on the stage, somebody was talking to him about kids and something like that.  And he just blobs whatever comes to his mind.  Maybe that thought of the same thought was going on.  He doesn't write the material. 
[04:10:00]  He goes up there.  He might make up the material right on the spot.  And he's not like he's commenting what's happened to him.  And again, this one, I would say he went on the stage and something happened to the kids or something.  One time, I got to tell you one thing.  So clarify something.  Let me explain something.  Please.  Okay.  No, no, no.  I'm not in denial.  This is a little deep denial.  Can I finish it?  First of all, Jamie, it's not true because he says that joke all the time. 
[04:10:30]  It's not like someone yelled at him, what about kids, Dane?  And then he just said, I want to name a kid with a lot of letters together, even though I've never heard anybody do that before.  And I will say, even though the bits are very similar, I did kind of enjoy Dane's bit too.  Did you enjoy it?  He does it with the nosh.  Fuck you.  One time, I've got to tell you something.  One time, Los Angeles Times was doing an article about Robin Williams taking material from other people. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  True.  And they called me, everybody, they talked to everybody in the industry, everybody.  They said, yeah, Robin doing that.  Robin did that on Tonight Show.  Robin did that from me here.  Robin did that.  But for Robin, my only thing is seeing him to what he's doing on the stage and how long he's been doing it.  Robin is a type of person, he's addictive to laughter.  And that's what I said.  You call him attention whores.  I don't know if he's attention.  He just doesn't, like a drug addict, he needs it fixed. 
[04:11:30]  The time he's on the stage.  He needs the laughter.  As opposed to what?  As opposed to every other fucking comedian?  As opposed to what, alternative comedy?  Yeah, that's what, Jamie, Jamie.  If you're defending, that's one of the shittiest.  No, no, I'm not saying no.  If you're defending it because he's addicted to.  Love, love, love.  No, no, I'm saying he took it, he took it.  So you're saying Robin, Robin Williams is a joke thief?  Absolutely, yeah.  Okay, so we have Robin, but Dane no. 
[04:12:00]  Still Dane no?  It's still Dane no.  Let's hear the third one.  Hold on, hold on.  Treat yourself to my material.  Okay, let's see.  Treat yourself.  Wait, Ari, what was your thought?  Buddy.  These are two bits.  Wait, we've got to get him to do it now, right?  All right, let's hear it.  Hold on a second.  Jamie, can you do me a favor and just say treat yourself?  Treat yourself.  What did I say?  What did I do?  Nothing.  Why are you picking on me now?  All right.  You sound like you got to know.  Buddy, listen.  You just sound like someone we know.  One more bit, buddy.  Someone that I...  Whatever.  All right, here's the third example.  Somebody took your material.  There's another one.  No, I jumped on his cake one day. 
[04:12:30]  Uh-oh.  After he said treat yourself.  Uh-oh.  All right, here's the third example.  First, Louis C.K., the bit is called itchy ass.  And I had an itchy asshole for like a week.  And I could have won a million dollars.  I still would have been going, fuck, my asshole!  It itches!  I wanted to like eat bad food so I wouldn't like fart to scratch it.  It was.  Oh, that's a damn funny bit.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah, I told it itches.  We're going to do that one on the radio Monday when we have a different audience. 
[04:13:00]  And here's Dane Cook a few years later.  The other day, I don't know if you've ever gotten this, it was about 2.30 in the afternoon.  I got the itchiest asshole I've ever gotten on record.  Oh, it's the worst, isn't it?  Oh, you just, you feel, usually you're at work or someplace that you can't focus on it.  You got to do some other activities, right?  And the entire day, you just kind of bounce around and try to, try to shake it out. 
[04:13:30]  Right?  Oh, man.  Just rewriting material, man.  Here's the deal.  Here's the question, Jamie.  These are three bits from a Louis C.K. HBO special that all three bits appeared on Dane Cook's CD four years later.  Okay.  Now, you're telling me.  Wait a minute.  Do you think it's even possible that he stole him?  Wait, wait, wait.  Is it possible?  I mean, let me finish what I'm saying.  Okay, but just answer that question first.  Is it possible? 
[04:14:00]  I don't know.  I don't, you know, I, personally, I don't think he's that type of person.  He's not that type of person, buddy.  He's not a person.  Buddy, he is.  Buddy, he is.  He's not a thief.  Okay.  Hey.  I mean, you said Louis C.K., he got an itchy asshole, and Dane, he would never have an itchy asshole.  That's what we're saying.  That's exactly what we're saying.  He got us right.  I was going to say it.  Buddy, itchy asshole happened to everyone.  I have itchy asshole right now. 
[04:14:30]  Right now.  My ass is itching.  Kill me.  So I can't say anything.  My ass is itching because...  I want to yell nigger because I...  Hey, hey, hey.  That's not...  That's not for that word.  I got to say one thing, man.  Jamie is punching his way out of the corner.  You got to give him something.  Yeah, he really is.  He's fucking swinging blind, bro.  Oh, yeah.  He hit...  You know, knowing in one of those old school fights where it's like 98,  round, bare knuckles.  You are 100% right that people will always be jealous of successful comedians, 
[04:15:00]  and they always wish that upon themselves.  But you're 100% wrong that that happens with every comedian.  That's not the case with Chris Rock.  It's not the case with Dave Chappelle.  It's not the case with David Tell.  There's a lot of very, very successful, very funny, very famous comedians  that no one ever says a word about them stealing material.  See, like Dice and Kinnison both were accused after they became huger than you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've never heard Kinnison being accused.  No?  No.  Yeah, I've never heard that either.  Kinnison accused Dice of one bit. 
[04:15:30]  There was a bit that, you know, Kinnison used to do a bit about gays.  I don't know.  How does one guy look at another guy's hairy ass and find love?  How does that happen?  And then Dice did a bit.  Oh, there's one guy, you know, seeing another guy's hairy ass.  And it was a very similar thing.  Right.  They'd work together.  Who knows?  But it was really like one bit.  That's one.  I was in a club the time they start fighting.  They start punching each other in the face.  Let's talk about Dice.  And I try to separate them because of, you know, again, people that come close to each other.  You've got a play to catch.  You know, it just, you know, you cannot, you know, I mean, if you know a person, if I, you know, 
[04:16:00]  I mean, if I know Dane, as long as I know him, 12 years or 13 years, he is not that type  of person stealing.  So maybe they're close, but he's not that type of person.  Why do so many people say he does?  Why do so many people say he does for like 10 years?  Why is that?  I have no idea because of maybe the people, they don't know him.  Jamie.  I know him.  It's the same guy from the same.  Listen, we're not going to solve this year.  Yeah, but you're not.  No, we do have a plane to catch at one. 
[04:16:30]  I like it though.  Jamie Masada has another version of the Laugh Factory here in New York, right?  Yes, sir.  It's on 42nd Street.  It's actually got a really cool vibe.  It's over Show World, which is a really, it's like a lot of the same interior was kept,  like the fucking lights.  And it's really a cool place to go, man.  I got a creature.  Whites only though.  Whites only.  Whites only.  That's right.  Who's at the Laugh Factory in New York here?  Who are you guys?  You brought me in here, roast me?  Are you trying to pick on me?  What did I do wrong to you guys? 
[04:17:00]  I'm sorry.  I was under a misconception.  That's what I heard.  I mean, I really, I love comics.  I love everybody.  I love Joe.  I love everybody in here.  I love you, Jamie.  You know?  I mean.  You got to understand the O.P. and Anthony show.  I love you guys too.  I listen to you guys all the time.  I love you too, man.  Yeah, I do.  I do.  My buddy from, my buddy, Tony, what they're called?  What's your favorite part of the show, Jamie?  Like when you listen to this show, what's your favorite bit?  The time that all of you guys, comedian, they're on it.  I love that show.  Very generic.  Yeah. 
[04:17:30]  Name one thing we've done.  Say what?  Name one bit we've done.  One signature bit.  One signature bit.  I mean, for example, the stuff you do all of the time you do.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  The time you were in another station, you were doing.  I was getting in Los Angeles.  I was getting a whole thing about you guys putting competitions, sex stuff.  What's going to gay, having a church, and all of that stuff.  Yeah, in the church.  It's a impression ONA party rock.  Does that mean anything? 
[04:18:00]  ONA party rock?  Yeah.  Do you know what wow is?  Yes.  What is it?  Wow?  Wow.  Wow.  W-O-W.  What is wow?  Yeah, wow.  It has something to do with our show.  Wow.  No.  Wow.  No.  All right.  Wow.  We just started that bit.  We don't do it that much.  We don't do it that much.  You might recognize it as Flash Friday.  Okay.  Speaking of ripping off.  Don't even get me started.  Who's Flash Friday?  Yeah.  Fucking like us.  That stinks.  Stupid Tom Lick-ass.  Anyway.  Who's at the club this week in New York? 
[04:18:30]  Everybody.  Good company.  Everybody.  I mean, I don't want all of the sevens.  Michael Richards?  Huh?  Michael Richards?  Yeah.  No, because you guys, you all.  I even want to say.  Name one comic who's there, Jamie.  I know.  I know.  For example.  Hey.  Jamie, name one comic who's there.  Jamie, just say Michael Richards is going to be there.  Ben Cook is my friend, buddy.  Jamie, you could be the president.  You could be the fucking president.  Why?  I could see you at a podium getting asked a question and just fucking going like, when  are we getting out of Iraq?  It's a big country, buddy.  Did you say Aries Spears?  Yeah. 
[04:19:00]  Tremendous thief.  Oh, here we go.  I knew if I said anybody I see, he's one big man.  That's not true.  That's not true.  I'm a huge supporter of comedians.  It's not true.  Yeah.  Aries Spears is a thief.  And you know what he is, don't you?  Oh, yeah.  He's a former cast member of Mad.  That's right.  Yeah, and he works with Damon Wayne right now on his new show.  You know what Damon Wayne's is?  A brother of other Damon Wayne's brothers.  What the fuck?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  What are you guys doing for me?  All right, listen.  We got a round of applause.  I should have just said nigger.  Oh, God. 
[04:19:30]  Long way.  Damn.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  What do you say, Jamie?  Say it once, just for old times' sake.  Say it one time.  What shall I say?  Bigger.  The word.  Bigger.  Bigger.  Bigger.  Bigger.  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  You picked on me now.  Now say no.  Now say nickel.  No.  No.  And we will edit that together.  All right, guys.  You're great.  Thank you very much.  All right, Jamie.  I love you guys.  Say no to the N-word.  Hold on.  Let me wrap this up.  Jamie, before you come back on the show, you got to do a little research. 
[04:20:00]  You got to understand our show.  You don't listen to our show, which is fine.  You're a busy guy.  No.  Don't forget.  I'm working until 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, I mean, you got to look at this.  In L.A., get an XM.  Listen for a couple weeks, and then we're going to test you.  Why don't we get Jamie an XM?  We can get Jamie, it's not an XM.  We got him an XM.  I get an XM.  Next time I'm in here, you test me everything.  Because we're very sharp here, Jamie.  We know when people are like, kind of...  Okay, okay.  Don't get on my case, please, guys.  I'm going to do it. 
[04:20:30]  One of the best clubs in L.A., if not the best club.  Beautiful fucking club.  Laugh factory.  Bad-ass place.  Once he gets rid of all the hacks, it'll be a really good place to perform.  Hey, hold on.  We backed you up on your N-word band, even though I don't in theory like it, but I know why you did it.  I backed you up on your N-word band, for that reason.  Jamie's always been cool to me.  I've been performing.  Jamie, just try to banish from my car.  All right.  Yeah, good luck.  When I drive home...  Opie, what do you got?  You going to the phone or something?  Yeah, we have to, because it was a very busy day. 
[04:21:00]  We're almost forgetting that we did the eggnog drinking contest today.  Eggnog, yes.  Pat won again this year.  Yes, he did.  He set a new record, 75 double shots of eggnog.  We did the baby bird, and we got our own Sam that we sent home early.  Hi, Sam.  Sam, what's up?  I got the video.  It's compressing now, and it'll be up in YouTube in 15 minutes.  All right, here's the problem with the video, though, because, I mean, with YouTube, it's  going to hang out for about 24 hours before it's available in the search chain, in the 
[04:21:30]  regular search.  Put a link up on opaanthony.com, and then we'll put one on Wackbag and put one on other message  boards, and it'll be great.  And also, they could search it out by just searching out your account, OAVideos.  Yep, that's the username, OAVideos.  All one word, OAVideos.  But the first video clip and many more from the eggnog drinking contest are going up as  we speak to Sam on the phone.  It's going to spread like wildfire.  Yeah, you guys, help us out on this one.  Let's make this really viral.  I don't think it's going to have much of a problem, but let's really push this one. 
[04:22:00]  No, I think the puking on the face.  Hey, where's that?  Show Jamie that picture from Pat.  Yeah.  He wasn't over at Free FM.  Yeah, this is what happened today.  It's a real photo.  The pictures are up on OpieNancy.com.  A guy throwing up on another guy.  That's eggnog.  He's throwing up in his mouth.  Oh, my God.  I saw it from the other room.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Fantastic.  Isn't it?  It's almost beautiful.  Yeah.  It's almost beautiful.  It is beautiful.  That is artwork.  Sam is going to be working on video clips all weekend long, so thank you, Sam.  Can I do something?  Can I plug something in here?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  LaughFactory.com.  Go see Joe Rogan. 
[04:22:30]  Go see everybody.  They are wonderful guys.  I love all of the comedians.  We love you, Jamie.  You know, it's just, please, don't put me on the spot like that, Joe.  Jamie's a good guy.  We love you, guys.  One in Los Angeles.  And to support the Laugh Factory here in New York on 42nd Street, it really is a cool club.  When he said, can I plug something, I was going to hand him a fork.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, baby.  Hey, I love a God.  Bondi, no.  We all just get along.  I was a little confused, that's all.  All that shit could be stopped, though, if you just stopped Pecklers. 
[04:23:00]  That's what people need to do.  Yeah, you got to stop Pecklers.  That was quick.  And ban the video phones there, Jamie.  I have a band that they cannot come in.  Don't you dare ban them.  No, they have a sign in the club you cannot videotape.  Most people can't read signs.  And, Jamie?  Yeah.  Well, I will end with this.  I have been your club, and I love your club in LA.  I'd love to have you back again.  I love your club in LA.  Thank you, sir.  It is a good place for comedy, okay?  Thank you.  Joe Rogan, Caroline's all weekend long.  Holla.  Videos up on opianthony.com and YouTube. 
[04:23:30]  You know, do what you can with those videos, guys.  And we'll be in West Palm Beach Monday and Tuesday broadcasting tomorrow night to bake sale.  What are we doing there?  Bring on bands and shit?  Yeah, it's just a hangout.  Yeah, we got up on stage.  Bring on some bands.  I got to go home and fucking pack, man.  Oh, shit.  I don't even know if I'm going to make the plan.  I'm at the Improv, Ontario, California.  Bye, everyone.  Wait, wait.  Wait, Bill Burr, what?  The Improv, Ontario, California.  All right.
