<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts riffing on their controversial past before diving into New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's sodium-in-soup campaign, which they mocked as a trivial concern compared to the city's larger problems like traffic and the MTA.  This led to a broader discussion about unhealthy food, including fast food salads, processed food ingredients (like the mysterious "teeter"), and unsanitary street vendors.  Callers contributed to the conversation, mentioning the "Twinkie diet," Chris Cornell's mustache, and a purported missile launch off the California coast. A former Navy officer called in to discuss the feasibility of the missile launch theory.  The segment concluded with discussion of Colin Quinn's Broadway success, and Opieâ€™s encounter with Michael Richards.  Upcoming guests Cain Velasquez and Jim Gaffigan were announced.

The next segment revisited the California missile sighting, with a caller, Dan, an aviator, suggesting it was likely a misidentified aircraft. This transitioned into humorous speculation about accidental missile launches and the difficulties of covering them up.  The hosts shared embarrassing red carpet stories, dismissed a Scott and Todd Facebook parody song as "horrible," and engaged in a lengthy discussion about George and Barbara Bush, playing clips from Oprah and Matt Lauer interviews, including a story about Barbara Bush's miscarriage.  George W. Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina and Kanye West's infamous Katrina telethon outburst were also discussed.  UFC fighter Cain Velasquez then joined the show in studio, talking about his career, particularly his fight with Brock Lesnar, his training, and his upcoming fight with Junior Dos Santos, detailing his fighting style and contrasting MMA with boxing.

The following segment continued the interview with Cain Velasquez.  The conversation delved into the graphic details of fighters' bodily functions before a fight, before shifting to a demonstration of martial arts holds on co-host Jimmy by Velasquez (with mentions of BJ Penn and Randy Couture, though neither were present).  This included detailed descriptions of arm bars and chokeholds, accompanied by video footage. Jim Gaffigan joined the discussion, adding his commentary and sharing his wrestling background. The discussion moved to Velasquez's upcoming fight against Junior Dos Santos, with input from Mars, an MMA expert and regular guest.  The segment covered Velasquez's family, his fighting style, and UFC's growing popularity in Mexico.  It also included anecdotes about heckling, the psychological effects of being hit in fights, different fighting styles, and the physical demands of the sport.  Videos of a Richard Belzer/Hulk Hogan incident and a Jason Ellis/Fedor Emelianenko incident were shown.  The segment concluded with plugs for Gaffigan's stand-up shows and a UFC event.

The final segment featured Jim Gaffigan as a guest. The conversation started with a rambling discussion about wrestlers and heart attacks, followed by more discussion of the California missile sighting, and the hosts' frustration with Michu Kaku.  Gaffigan discussed his upcoming Broadway play, *That Championship Season*, his struggles with *Call of Duty: Black Ops* (including detailed impersonations of his frustration), and his preference for mouse and keyboard over controllers.  He also discussed his dietary habits (a love of cheeseburgers) and his negative views on pervasive breast cancer awareness campaigns.  The conversation included anecdotes about urination accidents,  both Gaffigan's and a TMZ story about Reggie Jackson.  They discussed Jackson's personality, salary comparisons with A-Rod, and Gaffigan's personal encounter with him. The segment concluded with Gaffigan promoting his shows and another anecdote about soiling his pants.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  Fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show was a lot funnier on N.E.W.  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, all right  God, we just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Is this the last draw for the rocking radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Ah, good morning  Bloomberg, what is he saying this morning? 
[00:01:00]  Soup  Soup?  Soup  You know the answer?  Yeah  The answer is soup  What could possibly be the problem with soup?  We were talking about it yesterday  Too much sodium?  On this very program  And, yeah  You know what causes heart attacks?  Not too much sodium  Not the soup  Being stuck in traffic every fucking night going home  How about you deal with that problem?  Because I think people's blood pressure goes through the roof  When they're sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic  Day after day after day  Because the roads suck around Manhattan 
[00:01:30]  Yelling and screaming  This is a perfect example  But then you've got a politician  They take on soup instead of the highway system  Hot soup  You're kidding, right?  I didn't even know  There's a thing  It's going to cost the taxpayers  Upwards of about $150,000  To start advertising  That there's a lot of salt in soup  So he's going to have all these signs put up  In the subways and everything  Of a soup can  Opened up  With a geyser of salt coming out of it 
[00:02:00]  And saying how, you know  The sodium content in soups are very high  I don't understand that  We have to tell people that stuff is unhealthy  When did that start?  We're in a nanny state  Yeah, but  We're in a nanny state  Is that it?  Is that the geyser of soup?  Did you get any special education growing up  To learn that some of this stuff we eat  Is really bad for us?  Or you just kind of figure it out yourself?  Yeah, once you get older  You figure it out  So why do we have to spend money  Telling other people  That maybe soup isn't the best thing to eat every day  Because there's so much salt in it 
[00:02:30]  Because Mayor Bloomberg  Thinks he's got to babysit  The entire city of New York  And not only New York City  He's reaching over into other cities  And he's got these mayor coalitions  And everything from other cities  And he really wants to just be  Everyone's little nanny  So when is he going to take care of the highways?  Oh, that's somebody else  When is he going to take on the MTA  And tell them that  That's not my department  Well, you could still take them on 
[00:03:00]  You've got a little power, don't you?  Maybe have a meeting with the MTA  And say, you know  Most people can't afford to fucking  Cross over bridges  And go through your tunnels anymore  You're out of control  Soup doesn't fight back  Soup can't fight back  Soup has no arms  No legs  They're talking about soup today  Soup can't make a fist  Soup can't debate you  It's just soup  How about you create new jobs?  That would be good  I'm sure there's a bunch of people  That still need jobs out there  Not in the salt mines  Oh my God 
[00:03:30]  Losing jobs in the salt mines  Soup  That's his big thing  I know you have to be joking  No, that's the  You have to be joking  That's the sign right there  New York City  Look at that  Watch out for your soup  And they were giving Campbell Soup  A bunch of shit  And I guess Campbell Soup  Is one of the leaders  In trying to cut back on sodium  Right  I think it's  A lot of it has to do with preserving  It keeps the soup fresh, right? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, like all canned items  Have a lot of salt in them  As a preservative  And, you know  People like salt  So I think salt is good for you then  Because it must preserve your organs  After it goes in  Oh yeah, it's great  Just preserve those organs  Coat all those organs with some salt  Oh, the mayor  Gee, that's why I can't  I just can't, Anne  I'm sorry  This guy stinks  I know you want to battle it out  With somebody else  As far as politics go  I can't do it  When you have a mayor  Having a press conference  Over soup 
[00:04:30]  When there's bigger problems  In this city  I can't be involved with this  I know  It's ridiculous  I really can't  It is ridiculous  Sodium content of foods  Like salad dressing  And frozen pizza  Will also be put on the ads  To let consumers know  Of the hidden dangers  How do people not know this?  That's frozen pizza  Ah, danger  Do people know  When you get  Let's say  A fast food salad  Yeah  And they have croutons in it  Oh boy  That that's bad for you  Do you know that at least?  It's deep fried  Do you know those are deep fried 
[00:05:00]  And you might as well  Eat a hamburger  Pretty much at that point  It's deep fried bread  When you're squeezing out  The salad dressing  It comes out  In globs  You can't figure out  That that can't be good for you  Why do we have to tell people this?  Nothing in a glob  Is good for you  Right  Nothing that comes out  In a glob  Of course not  Is good for you  It tastes good  Right  But no  I just don't  I don't understand  I didn't take any special courses  You just kind of figure it out 
[00:05:30]  And some of the stuff you eat  And you feel like shit  After you eat it  You can taste it  So you think to yourself  Wow, maybe this isn't  The best thing to eat  Yeah  But it does taste delicious  So I'm going to continue doing it  Oh, is that a hundred  The cost of the $370,000 campaign  Will be shared between  The city taxpayers  And the federal government  And by the federal government  We're talking about  Federal taxpayers  Sure  Because that's where  Their money comes from  Sure  So  Look, there you go  Stress and the city 
[00:06:00]  That's what we need to deal with  Not soup  New York City  Number one city for stress  In what way?  In the United States  It's just the most stressful place to live  In what way?  They just say stress  I live here  They just say stress  I think it is the traffic  The soup  Oh, well, it's probably  It's crazy  The soup  It's the soup  It's all about the soup  Soup makes you so stressed out  Right  Whenever I'm sitting there  Eating a nice hot bowl of soup  Don't you just go  Ah! 
[00:06:30]  I can't take this soup  And how much soup  Do you have to eat  For this to become  An actual problem?  A lot of soup  I could do a bowl of soup  Maybe once a year  I hate soup  I love soup  Do you like soup?  But I don't eat a lot of it  I don't want soup every day  Sometimes I get miso soup  Nice  When I'm getting sushi  Some miso  Or Chinese  I'll get a little wontons  Wonton!  I'll get some  A couple of wontons  Some 
[00:07:00]  A nice  Yes  A lobster bisque  Do you know lobster bisque  Is bad for you?  Of course  It's cream  You don't need the mayor  To tell you right?  No  And the miso soup  You could just taste the salt  In that  It's very salty indeed  But it comes from the sea  I believe  There's seaweed in it  Do people  Consume way too much salt  Because  When I consume way too much salt  And I can feel my lips  Just getting puffy  Oh god  And dry  And kind of like 
[00:07:30]  You know what I mean?  That feeling of like  You ever watch a show  On people that are shipwrecked  Yes  How their lips look?  Right  That's what it feels like  If you have too much sodium  When I go to my  Dumb Islander games  Which I haven't talked about lately  Because they suck a dick  They should just blow up  That whole coliseum  And start over  At this point  I'm going to do an expose video  I've decided  On the Islanders  Oh wow  Oh am I going to give them  A fucking beating  But anyway  When I go to my hockey games  I'll have a popcorn  Or maybe a bag of peanuts  And man my lips 
[00:08:00]  Just like you described  I feel like I'm shipwrecked  They're swollen like I'm in Hollywood  And I had to get duck lips  And guess what?  I say to myself  I'm done with salt for a while  I think I had my sodium intake for a week  Right  Who keeps eating salt at that point?  You know what?  You know you have too much sodium  Also when you're done  And like two hours later  You lick your lips  And you taste salt  Yes  It's like  What the fuck man?  I had a lot of salt today  But our stupid mayor  Is getting involved with soup and salt 
[00:08:30]  Don't  Yeah the mayor  It's not his job  God  He has taken on a position  Where he thinks it's his responsibility  To really be everybody's nanny  And babysitter  And try to take care  And educate people  It's not  People that like soup  Are sitting there going  Wow I didn't even know  It had that much sodium  And if you are saying that  It's time to thin the herd  Darwinism  Just snort salty  Darwinism  Snort it 
[00:09:00]  He's taking on Darwin  Yeah he is  Not all the baby turtles  Make it to the ocean  They don't  Some have to die on the way  Some turtles are put in soup  So we have less traffic  You like the word soup today  I can't get enough of this soup story  Soupy soup  It's so ridiculous  But that's the mayor  It goes along with everything else  He's been doing  With the cigarettes  How about you take on the education system  Of New York City  Whoa whoa whoa  Slow down  He is  Oh yeah is he  He just appointed a new head of 
[00:09:30]  A chancellor  Yeah and apparently  She has no background in education  There you go  So how about you get someone  That has a background in that shit  And worry about the salt in the soup  At a later date  Because if you have a better education system  In the city  Then maybe people will understand  That salt isn't a good thing  He says she's very good  Because she knows business management  And that's I guess what you need  In the board of education  Yeah  So that's what he does now  Right  And they're in soup  I think they were very happy  That the graduation rate 
[00:10:00]  Is up to 63%  63%  In the city  Alright  I guess that means all the boroughs  Right  63%  You know when I graduated high school  Many years ago  I think one kid fell down  Yeah  Maybe two  Maybe two  They had that stigma  How is it 63% only  And they're proud of that by the way  And you know how they solve it  That's two  That means one out of three  Is not graduating high school  No  They solve it by making the tests easier 
[00:10:30]  Oh I know  And they pull back  And they still can't get the numbers up  And they still can't do it  They just dumbed down the curriculum  Right  And they call it problem solved  Look the grades went up  Yeah  You're really teaching them moronic stuff  But he knows everything  He's the guy that you know  Thank God now  If you get a good mayor in there  He can run for three terms right  Isn't that true? 
[00:11:00]  Oh no  That was just for him  That's right  That was a trick question  Anthony  It really was  It was just for him  And then he  Because he's  He's so great  He didn't  He wanted us to know how great he was  Because we didn't understand how great he was  Yes  You need me for three terms  And how about how he did it  He just said  I want three terms  And people said  Well why don't we put it to a vote  From the people  And he said  No  No  I'm going to just go 
[00:11:30]  And do it  And he went and did it  And then  When he wants it repealed  Yeah  He goes  Let's let the people vote  Right  And the people  Overwhelmingly voted  That they did not want  Three terms for a mayor  They want two  A two term limit  I enjoy seeing a new schmuck in there  I just enjoy that  Why do you have to look at the same schmuck for three terms  It really is  Who's the next schmuck  Let's move on to him  Who would be the next mayor 
[00:12:00]  I don't know  Who's in line  And when he said  No no no  I'm just going to do three terms  Yeah  Where were the people to say  Whoa wait a minute  What the fuck  There were some people saying  Well put it to a vote  Let the people vote  And he was like  Nah  They couldn't rally the troops to say  This is not  This is not how  The system is set up  A lot of people were  Very upset with him about that  But he squeaked it through anyway  Because that's what he does  And then  You know  With his  His wrangling  And deal making  And he's rich 
[00:12:30]  And then  The odd thing is  When he wanted it repealed  He left that to the people  And again  Overwhelmingly  They said  They do not  They want term limits  On the mayor  Yeah it's unbelievable  This guy is a snake  He ran under a Republican ticket  Because the Democrats didn't want him  And he's an ultra-liberal douchebag  Oh yeah  I cannot wait to say  Adios 
[00:13:00]  Adios  To Mayor  It's all about the salt  So what are you going to do  It's salt  It's soup  It's all about soup  Keith's from Connecticut  All these food companies  Are afraid of lawsuits  How do you sue a fucking food company  For feeding you  That would be a little odd  I know people do sue food companies  If they're obese  Or their families have had health issues  Because of their food  Diabetes  But it's like  Any judge that would entertain this 
[00:13:30]  Should just be smacked in the face  Enough  Right  Let me say hi to Nate in Delaware  Nate  Nate  Hey how's it going Anthony  What's up Nate  Hi sir  Hi Jimmy  Hi  How about the guy that said hello to you asshole  Go fuck yourself  Hi  You want to say hi to the janitor too  How about you start with the guy that said  Hey Nate what's up  Common courtesy  Piece of shit 
[00:14:00]  Enough of that shit  Away with you  McFly in California  What's going on buddy  McFly  Yeah McFly  I used to haul this shit called teeter  And in an 80 degree day temperature  And when this shit hit the ground  Alright  It would be like concrete  They use it in coffee made  Coffee made  I love coffee made  Wait there's something called teeter  That's in our food obviously  Oh yeah  Yeah this stuff is like concrete  When it gets below 230 degrees

[00:15:00]  Coffee creamer  Shit like that  If Bloomberg knew what kind of crap goes into  Stuff like that  And Marichan noodle  What's a Marichan noodle  Do you know  I have no idea what foods this man is talking about  I don't know your strange foods  I don't know of your odd foods  I don't have to eat  He got a personal chef  Yes  I don't eat teeter  Alright guys  I'll punch you now  Later 
[00:15:30]  Alright  Is it the pink goo  That's in the Chicken McNuggets  That we learned about  A couple weeks back  Oh god  The pink goo  Is that the teeter  Even on a more  Local level  All these  You know  The coffee cart truck things  The little one man  Stainless steel phone booths  That some savage stands in  And hands out bagels and rolls in  Sure  As I'm driving to work in the morning  I see these guys setting up  They take their trailer  Which is that little phone booth-y thing 
[00:16:00]  Right  It's hooked up to their truck  Something  Sorry  They then like unhitch it  Pull it over to where they gotta pull it  Right  With their bare hands  You know  They're strong  And then  With no water or anything  I then see them go in  And start buttering the rolls  With bare hands  After they're handling  Their fucking trailer hitch  Their greasy trailer hitches  And shit  Yeah  And they're just  They got their big nasty hands  And they're just slathering butter  On these rolls 
[00:16:30]  And stacking them up  Like who's  Would he eat that  I don't know  Disgusting  A lot of those guys  Pull their own  Coffee trucks  Or carts  Whatever  Yeah  On the east side  There's like a garage  Oh I love that  When they're walking down the street  Taking up an entire lane  Yeah  Walking  It's like where am I  Saigon  They gotta walk to their post  Yeah  With their coffee carts  Their dumb coffee cart  You can't even call it a cart  Because these things  Are very  Very large  Yeah  But they have to pull them  And they're stopping traffic 
[00:17:00]  Oh  It's like some fucking  Third world country  Sometimes to go home  I cut right across Manhattan  And I end up  In that area  Where they  Store those things  Overnight  And you see them  Going in with the bagels  And the rolls  Still in there  Oh they're still in there  And you think  Someone's in the warehouse  Like you know  Picking through  To make sure  They don't serve  A stale one  The next day  No fucking way  I don't know for sure  All that shit  I get behind them  Sometimes when  They're driving their trailer  Down the road  Because they don't drive 
[00:17:30]  Very fast  And it's very annoying  But you see them  Going over bumps  And you just see  Donuts and bagels  Bouncing around  On the shelf  I'm sure a few  Land on the floor  No one's looking  They pick them up  And put them back  On the shelf  They don't care  There's asbestos  Brake dust  Just going into  Their little dumb cart  But you know what  In the end  It tastes delicious  Oh people love it  They line up  For these things  It's terrible  Alright whatever 
[00:18:00]  So it's about  Soup today  In our city  Yeah that's what  What is it about  In your city today  Yeah  What are they talking  About in your city  What's your mayor  Trying to stop  We have soup here  Just let us live  It really shows  That New York  Has become  A fairly safe city  Back in the 80's  In the early 90's  When David Dinkins  Was mayor  He had to worry  About wilding  And shootings  And blacks  And Jews  Going at it 
[00:18:30]  On the streets  And he really  Didn't have time  For soup  And things like that  But Bloomberg  Is like  Ah look at that  Street's pretty safe  We occasionally  Get somebody  That wants to  Blow up Times Square  But for the most part  Streets are pretty safe  These days  Sure  Let's go after  Soup  It's about the  Soup  It's all about  The soup  Hot soup  It's ridiculous  There's a  He really doesn't  Have anything to do  I think 
[00:19:00]  That's what it is  He's rich  Powerful  And decides  He's just going  To do dumb things  But that's my point  There's a lot to do  But they don't want  To take on the tough stuff  These politicians  Don't want to take on  The tough stuff  To actually make  Your life better  Every time I have to  Get on that  Long Island Expressway  To go and visit  You know  My family  It's crazy  I'm like  Why aren't they  Taking care of  This fucking road  There's obviously  A major problem  If it's bumper to bumper  Traffic at 2 in the afternoon  It's not rush hour yet  Yeah  There's  Rush hour I understand  You know  That's a tough fix  How about on a 
[00:19:30]  Saturday morning  You know  You want to  Race out to Long Island  For a quick visit  And you're stuck  In traffic already  11am on a Saturday  Yeah  Fix that problem  It was  When I was  Going home yesterday  I was taking the expressway  And I regret  What time  10.30 right  It was about 10.30  In the morning  That means everyone  That works  Should be at their desks  Yeah I'm going eastbound  Eastbound is supposed  To be wide open  Away from the fucking rush hour  Yeah well that's when  They decide  You know  You're going to fix the roads  Oh yeah that too  And I was just stuck 
[00:20:00]  You know what I hate  Roving street repairs  Roving street repair  It's the slowest moving vehicle  With the blinking arrow  That tells you to get over  Where people cannot comprehend  How to pass these things  That panics everybody  They jam on the brakes  Roving street repair  It's the big giant arrow  And the slowest vehicle  On the face of the earth  Right  And people just don't know 
[00:20:30]  To get over  They get behind it  Or they get in the middle lane  And won't pass it  Yeah  What do they think  That thing's a blinker  That it's changing lanes  No get past the fucking thing  I bet you they think that  It's coming into our lane Murray  At any moment  It's going to make a lane change  Yeah it's making lanes change  It's giant arrow blinker  It's so infuriating  I'm not a fan of lane closures  Lane closures  Where they close the lane  For about two to three miles  Before the actual construction area 
[00:21:00]  Yeah  I'm all for close it  Right at the construction  Just a wall right there  Box them into the lane  Just confuse the whole lot of them  Wait my lane is just ending  That's all I need  Do you know we hit  One time me and Kenny were going  We were driving to DC  And we hit  It was like one in the morning  An hour  We were probably  A quarter mile behind cops  That were driving slow  Yeah  And slowing the traffic down  I guess to let the trucks  It was like exit 7 to 7 a.m.  The turnpike  It was the most enraging  Traffic I've ever hit  Because they were building a bridge 
[00:21:30]  So they had to slow down traffic  A mile or three miles before  And it really mixes up  The lanes and the cars  Because then when the closure  Let's say the left lane is closed  Right  And when the left lane then opens up  People just feel compelled  Because it opened up  To get into it  Yeah  Not knowing it's still  You know the fast lane  Right  Don't get in the fucking thing  Unless you're going to go fast  Right  So they just get in it  And drive under the speed limit 
[00:22:00]  You're like  Can you get out of my way  Unbelievable  Yeah  I want to know what the other mayors  Are talking about today  The mayors  Yeah well  Of course beer  Beer drink pretty good  Our soup tastes pretty good  Yeah our mayor is concerned about  How soups we got  The salt content  Tramble  That's what we're talking about today  That's what our stupid mayor  Is all concerned about today 
[00:22:30]  Important stuff  I mean the economy's doing great  There's no problem with the roads  That is what he should be thinking of  The MTA is running fine  Yeah  You don't even have to  You know raise rates or anything  I don't understand a society  Where you gotta tell people  What's  What is unhealthy  I don't get it  He's a nudge  We just talked about this  Jimmy  And it's like  I didn't have any special  Fucking training or classes  Growing up  You just knew what was good for you  And what wasn't  Collar gym bra  Right  A fucking raw carrot  I believe would be  Good for you 
[00:23:00]  Good for you  You know what he is  He's a yenta  That's what Mike Bloomberg is  He is a yenta  He is a yenta  And he just wants to be involved  In every facet  Of every citizen's life  But nothing that you care about  For dumb stuff though  Yeah  Thank you  Yes  Nothing you care about  Calorie couch was a good move  That informs the public  But how about you stop  Turning New York into a fucking  It's not an outdoor park  It's a city of commerce  Yes  People work here  You know  I agree with you now  Jimmy  At first I didn't  But with the calorie counts  And I look at these menus 
[00:23:30]  I'm like  I had no fucking idea  I'm learning a little bit  Here and there  Yeah  That helps people make  Smarter decisions  And I'm fine with that  Right  Because they say shit like  Low fat  And you see  Low fat muffins  And we're not dieticians  It's like you just think  You're doing good for yourself  And you're not  It's bullshit  It's language  Well it's trickery  Because I mean  A low fat muffin  Is still really  Not necessarily good for you  Because a regular one  Is really really fat  A regular muffin  Could be up to  I don't know  A thousand calories  Yeah  A low fat muffin  Is 700  So I mean 
[00:24:00]  It's still a lot  Think about it  I mean I just made up  Those numbers  But it's probably  Pretty close to that  It's low fat in comparison  Right  With the regular  It's all these trick words  They use  Because they just  Want you to buy stuff  Yeah  You know  When these fast food  Restaurants started  Making salads  Because they knew  People were more aware  And they're going to eat healthy  They fucking made  The salad taste good  By adding a lot of  You know  Shit to it  A lot of shit to it  Which makes it  Almost as bad as the burger  Of course  In some cases worse  And it's just a ploy  To get people 
[00:24:30]  Into the place  Because you could be like  I think I'm going to have  A salad at McDonald's  And you get in there  And you look at that board  And go  Let me get a cheeseburger too  Or  You're right  Or you go  You know what  I'm going to have a salad  Because I'm trying to eat better  And then you think to yourself  Well I'm having a salad  That's pretty damn healthy  I think I'm just going to have  A side order of fries  I got some fries with the salad  Because I'm not eating  A Big Mac here  Right  And then you realize  In the end  You're eating  You know  Sometimes more calories 
[00:25:00]  Eating shite  Yeah  Just crap  Oh you hear about  The Twinkie guy  Thank you Oscar Butts  In Michigan  Oh Oscar Butts  Oscar Butts  Did you hear about  The Twinkie diet  Asshole  Lost weight or something  I think he's a nutritionist  And I don't know  Do we have the story  In front of us  This is a perfect spot for it  He ate Twinkies for  You know  The famous 30 days  Or whatever it was  Lose weight by eating junk food  Nutrition professor  Drops 27 pounds  On Twinkie diet  In two months  But see 
[00:25:30]  Now what did he do  Now Ann has taught me  About some stats and shit  What is  Alright if the guy  Lost 27 pounds  Eating Twinkies  Obviously Twinkies  Are extremely fucking fattening  It just means  He was taking in  Less calories  Less calories  That's all that is  Twinkies aren't healthy for you  You're not going to lose weight  By eating Twinkies  People think they could  Sit on their ass  Eat Twinkies  And lose weight  No  And he's probably  Exercising  And you know  Did the guy have  An exercise regimen  Where he's HIV positive  He was also eating 
[00:26:00]  A small amount of vegetables  Every day  And a multivitamin  And a protein shake  But yeah  So then this is horseshit  If you're going to have  A Twinkie diet  That you're supposed to eat  Just nothing but Twinkies  He was cutting his calories  Down like immensely  Like it says  He went from  2,600 calories a day  To 1,800  Yeah  And so he's  He'll lose weight  Especially just saying  That's one Twinkie  Right  Yeah if you cut down  Your calories  Yeah no matter what  You'll lose weight  You'll lose weight  You'll lose weight  That's basic math 
[00:26:30]  Right  Jesus  People  But people see this  Oh Twinkies  Nice  And they'll just do it wrong  Yeah good luck with that  You think you're going to  Lose weight eating Twinkies  I got a bridge  I can sell you boobie  Oh god  Helen  Love Helen  Helen rules  I hate the name  Did you see Conan's debut  Helen  I saw part of it  I didn't understand  The whole beard  He looks like a mountain person  I was like who is this  Grizzly Schmizly  Get out of here you  You know over the summer 
[00:27:00]  Chris Cornell  Ran into Anthony  And I think  Oh god what kind of car  Was he driving  Don't get me started  I haven't slept  And I think he took on  Your look for the big  Conan appearance last night  Soundgarden was on Conan  And he's pretty much  Sporting a Hitler mustache  On Conan  There you go  Yeah he is  There you go  Going with a Hitler mustache  Wow  How are they  What's going on with that  I love Soundgarden  Were they good on the Conan  They can't do no wrong for me 
[00:27:30]  Damn  Yeah here's a  Here's a little taste  Let's hear a little  Web exclusive  Soundgarden performance  That is huge  Just look for the  The Chris Cornell mustache  The Hitler mustache  Yeah  Sing Chris 
[00:28:00]  I noticed they're not really  Doing a close up  Of Chris Cornell  Maybe they're a little  Worried about the  Were they worried about  The Hitler mustache  Trying to play vocals  Somebody at Conan  Yeah really  There they go  See the mustache 
[00:28:30]  Holy crap  That is a Hitler mustache  It's coming back  Coming back  There you go  Yeah they're not doing  A lot of close ups  On him like you  Would normally  I think they're a little  Worried about his luck  That he chose  For the Conan show  A Hitler mustache  Isn't it  I've been thinning  Mine down  I noticed that  You almost have  A pencil thin mustache  Yes yes  I'm going with the  Oldie time 
[00:29:00]  Hollywood guy  Douglas Fairbanks  Yes Douglas Fairbanks  I'm going with that  And then the sides  I'm bringing them in  A little past  The corners of the mouth  Eventually I'll just have  The same thing  Michael Jordan  Has the Hitler mustache  The Jordan mustache  Yes yes  So creepy  Bringing it back  We're all bringing it back  Hey the other thing  Really fast  So did someone launch  A missile in California  That's a missile  That's a mystery  They're trying to tell us 
[00:29:30]  Now it's a plane or something  Well you believe  The government telling you  It's an airplane  I know it's a missile  I was a Navy SEAL  A former governor  A fighter  Shut up  A freedom fighter  A freedom fighter  A freedom fighter  I'm going to places  You haven't even heard of  Yeah they say  Southern California  I think this show  Is a missile  I think this show  Is very good at  Breaking things down 
[00:30:00]  For people  Yeah  Instead of the horse shit  That they see on TV  I think someone  Simply just fucked up  In a submarine somewhere  You think somebody  Yes  In the Pacific Ocean  I think this is  A fuck up  A whoopsie  I think this is  A whoopsie  And they can't come on TV  And go well  One of our guys  Although I would think  It would be pretty tough  To do that right  Wow  Yeah they said  It's an illusion  Here's the official word  I heard  It's an optical illusion  Because it was  During sunset 
[00:30:30]  Sunrise in the east  That's an illusion  Look at that  Are you kidding me  So it made the contrail  Look very red  And it's a plane  Flying from west to east  And it makes it look like  A missile flying from east to west  Makes it look like  It's going away from you  When it's actually  Just coming toward you  Well you know  You know aviation  What are you thinking  I don't know  I've never seen a thick 
[00:31:00]  Contrail like that  No  No way  That's a very  Yeah  Thick  I really think  I think so much  That's wicky  But it doesn't  Also doesn't look  Quite like a missile  Plume either  Because missile  It's not contrail  It's fucking fuel  And if you look at  The beginning of that  Contrail  If that was a missile  That would be a lot of  Like billowy smoke left  And it's clearing out  Like a plane contrail  Like vapor  So I don't fucking know 
[00:31:30]  Wow  You don't know really  No  It could be something  They don't want to  Fucking talk about  Of course they don't  Whatever  It could be some  You know  Experiment  I don't believe  Everything the government  Tells me  I don't either  Man  Actually I don't  You shouldn't  Yeah  I don't  I was trying to make a joke  And realize  Wait I was just making  A statement  What do you  I mean  We talked with experts 
[00:32:00]  We went to a junior high  Where children were launching  Estes model rockets  And they say it was a missile  I have to believe them  Stop  God I hate Jesse Ventura  Why do you bring him up then?  Because I can't stop watching his show  Is it good?  No  Was there a new one on?  There was one on Wall Street  Does it get anything done?  Nothing gets done  And he talks to the most  Well uncredible witnesses  You'll Google their names 
[00:32:30]  When he says who they are  And you're like  Well this person's a nobody  Wait Rochester doesn't even have a mayor?  Oh yeah?  Hold on a minute  Because remember we  Remember we said  We want to know what your mayor's doing today  Because our dumb mayor's all about soup and salt  Soup?  Dave in Rochester  You're trying to tell me  Rochester doesn't have a mayor?  Well I mean he's there until January  But he's going to be Cuomo's lieutenant mayor  So we got no mayor  How about a man named Goldie Wilson  My friend  You saw what he did for Hill Valley didn't you? 
[00:33:00]  It was a great place  Clean  Nice  And it turned into a shithole  Where the movie theater was a porn theater  The nice little corner cafe  Turned into an exercise place  And  Mayor Goldie Wilson  I'm going to clean up this town  The town was clean  Yes  That's a good idea  Run for mayor  Colored mayor  That'll be the day  That'll be the day  In person  It uh  What was wrong with Hill Valley? 
[00:33:30]  It was fine  Uh  It was fine  And then uh  Goldie got in there  And  And the place went to shit  Bums sleeping on the fucking  Park benches  Well that's probably what's going to happen  Because we're going to go back to the days  And Opie may remember  Remember Grady?  Grady?  Grady yeah  Uh  Was he uh  The mayor when I was up there?  Yeah  Well we're going to go  He's the one who got the ferry  And uh  You remember the ferry  And all that  Where it did  You know  It was just a big money 
[00:34:00]  You know  I think they were trying to get a ferry  To go from what  Um  Rochester to Toronto  Or something  Was that the thing?  Couldn't figure that one out  Hell no  They got it  It ended up being a big money pit  And uh  Duffy got rid of it  Who was the next police chief  And he had the city  Uh  Pretty well tied up  I mean  He had all the troublemakers  Tied up up around  Comfort Avenue  And all that  Had them all contained  Now we're going to get  Some liberal in there again  Who's going to  You know  Open up everything  And the city  Will go to hell  More importantly 
[00:34:30]  How much snow  You guys got already  Oh boy  Actually none  But I was in  I was in Cleveland yesterday  And they had snow in Cleveland yesterday  Snow in Cleveland  Holy shit  It's not bad enough  LeBron left that city  Now they got to deal with snow  They're trying to make it  As wide as possible  I got one more thing  About the missile  Yes Dave  Being the next Navy man  I think  You were right on the money  That it went out  Of a sub  And the reason  That comp trail  Changed like  What Anthony was saying 
[00:35:00]  Is because  When they hit the abort  Shuts off the fuel  And then it's just  You know  When they hit  When they figure out  What happened  They hit the abort button  It shuts off everything  But it's still got to  Burn off a little bit  And it's still got  Velocity going up in the air  So that explains that  Well wouldn't they  Wouldn't they  Hit the old  Destruct button also  Then you gotta  Then you gotta  Explain  Then you have to explain  A flash in the sky  Or an explosion  Especially if it was 
[00:35:30]  Armed with a nuclear  Warhead  Get to that  Geez  You're really speculating  Now aren't you  Also there was  Nelly  But wouldn't that  Explain why  Sorry wouldn't that  Explain why the smoke  Didn't puff  Like Anthony said  You'd see all that  Residual smoke  But wouldn't you  Not see that  If it started in the water  I'm saying when it  Come out of the water  It was still under power  When it got up in the air  They hit the abort button  Shut off the fuel  And everything  You can't have it explode  You have  You have  They have  Ships that come out  And pick up the  Ordinance 
[00:36:00]  That don't  That don't go off  And stuff  During  During war time  War games  And all that  So that's what happened  Oh sir  Well it certainly  Gained a lot of altitude  Then if  It had no power  I'll tell you that  Because it was still  Climbing like crazy  Was it really  Yeah  Because  They said  And they said  You know  Changed direction  Oh dude  That's not  A plane contract  Look at the bend in it  There's like that  Right elbow crook  That's like a missile launcher  It has to be  I just want to know 
[00:36:30]  If it was a mistake  I want to know  If it was a mistake  I want to know  If it was somebody else  Maybe it was  Cyber terrorists  Some other  Using a little app  On their iPhone  You think they got a  Maybe the wires  Were crossed  Polaris missile app  Right  Guy was using  That's a better explanation  Than your Hill Valley explanation  Guy was just playing  Angry Birds  And all of a sudden  The wires crossed  And he set off a missile  That's a good explanation  Yeah  Angry Birds  No 
[00:37:00]  Gregorio  I don't like his explanation  Why don't you like his explanation  Because it's still under power  Yeah but maybe  It got some speed going  Before they hit the old  That much fucking speed going  Why not  That thing would be  Because that thing would start arcing  And where did it go  Where did it go  Did anybody see it  From beginning to end  Where did it go  Are you talking to me now  I'm talking to anybody  That'll listen  In general  I'm just hoping  Somebody listens  They got video  Didn't they just keep the video rolling 
[00:37:30]  To see what this became  Yeah what did they do  What did they do  And then you could study the video  To see if there's something  Still in the sky at least  Yeah  And there was a flicker of red  But they said that could have been  A reflection of the sun  Oh yeah  You see that  You see that bouncing off planes  Living in New York  All the time  Yeah  Something like  What the fuck was that  Oh the sun just hit a fucking  It's not a plane though  I don't think it's a plane either  Man  I don't think it is  Alright Dave  Alright see ya  Hey maybe  Thank you sir  Maybe we get our friend 
[00:38:00]  Mike Baker  Yeah Mike might know  You think Mike might know something  He might have an idea  But I mean again  I'm not going to call  Mike and tell him either  By looking at it  You might have an idea  See there  It's still going  I don't know  And then why  Like whoever's taping this  Or recording it  Why  Are they showing graphics  Just show the missile  Show the missile  From beginning of the recording  To the end  That's all  And then you know  Oh shit Anthony  Explanation coming in right here 
[00:38:30]  Oh yeah  Sean in Jersey  Go ahead Sean  Give us some knowledge  It's John in Jersey  There was a computer named Jonathan  And they just couldn't play  Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick-Kick  Fuck  Fuck  Jonathan  Joshua you dope  Oh my god  It's the Whopper computer  Jonathan  Did you see that jerk  Oh what a dunce  Oh you can't just name the computer  Whatever you want  You know what I loved about that 
[00:39:00]  Hello Bill  The confidence the guy had  Oh he did  Here we go  It's Jonathan the computer  From War Games  That's right  Yeah  Exactly  Exactly  And this guy basically saying  It's a Tomahawk missile  He knows  Oh  So why isn't he on CNN  Hey Dave if you know  That's what it is  Get on  Get your ass on CNN  I'm not an expert  But I mean  Plays one on the radio  Calling show  I'm not an expert  I'm not an  Aeronautical engineer  I'll be honest with you Dave  Hold on  Hold on 
[00:39:30]  You're just as qualified  As half these idiots  That do  Claim to be experts  On TV  And us as well  Right  No if you look at video  These missiles  These Tomahawks  Going off  They launch vertical  Then they bend horizontal  And go down for an  After the Earth flight  And that's what that looks like  Oh yeah  Hmm  I thought Ant would know  A little more than he does  On this one  No I can't  You know why  It's one of those  They're not giving me  Enough info  Right  They show the thing  In mid flight  And they don't show  Where it ends 
[00:40:00]  Because the news got bored  And said ah  We don't need to show you  Any more of this  I want to see the whole  Fucking thing  We got a cute kitten  In a tree somewhere  We got to go to next  Does it just fly over  The guy's head  And you see it go  Toward the horizon  He should have recorded  This thing for the entire time  Of course  Does it go straight up  Into the atmosphere  Weir  Wants to ask  And how difficult  He thinks it is  To fire off a missile  I would think  It's pretty difficult  I would think so too  I think there's a lot of 
[00:40:30]  A lot of steps  I don't think  You know  The cook  Can turn the stove on  And then go  Oh  Uh oh  He's in the galley  And uh  Inadvertently  Hits the switch  This guy thinks  It's a North Korean  Missile  Oh boy  Alan  North Korea  Is uh  Off Catalina  Alan  Yeah  Hey what up  It was close to the shore  What was it  About 30-40 miles out  Something like that  Yeah you think  It was North Korea  Yeah they snuck  Their good submarine  In there 
[00:41:00]  You can't sneak  A submarine  That close  Yeah they sneak a submarine  Uh  Right off of Los Angeles  You might be able to  Yeah they got that far  But their missile  Just didn't do any good  You know what I mean  You might be able to get  A thousand miles  Off the coast  A couple hundred miles  Off the coast  You're not gonna sneak  A North Korean  Fucking submarine  North Korea  Isn't firing a missile  In California  No and North Korea  Couldn't take a sub  From  What sir  North Korea  To the  California coast  You just keep talking 
[00:41:30]  Just keep talking  Just keep plowing  Over everything  Oh I hope you eat  Too much soup  And your lips  Lips get puffy  Your lips get all  Puffy and salty  What an idiot  Alright why don't we  Take our first break  It's getting out of control  Where's that snow  They're showing on the news  Oh  Where's that  That's a lot of  Fucking snow  That's some kind of rain  What do we got  Rain  What is that  Ski resort  Snowing  I want to go skiing  Oh I was looking  At the upper TV  I haven't skied 
[00:42:00]  In many years  Fuck  Alright  Northwest  Coastal flood  Advisor  Oh my god  Can I tell you  How masterful  Colin was last night  Ah  Why wasn't  I wanted to be  I didn't get invited  Either  I actually called  I found out about  I think that he just  Had somebody doing it  Yeah  Cause I called his  Tom Papa  Tom me and Tom  Were talking  I'm like when's the premiere  And he told me  It was last night  Opening night  This was last week  And he goes  Oh here I'll send you  The email from  From the assistant  And she's like  Oh good  We'd love to have you  I think that they  Just got caught up  I don't like to be  Invited and support 
[00:42:30]  Colin  But I wasn't invited  Either  Big debut on Broadway  With Long Story Short  I think on Colin's end  He was more worried  About getting the content  Together  And he probably  Did you see the first version  Of this  I did  So what's the difference  Between the two shows  The difference is  It's tighter now  The material is tighter  The stage is much better  The screen is beautiful  It really is great man  The lady in the post  Gave it two and a half stars  I got her review  It's not a bad review 
[00:43:00]  It's just that she's  She's the only one  That gave it a so-so review  By the way  Travis was giving us  The skinny before the show  And this play is getting  Great reviews  Across the board  Except for this  Elizabeth Vincentelli  She's not even killing it  She gave it two and a half  Out of four  Probably look  Let's be honest  Colin's opinions  Probably bother some people  People don't even mean to  I watched it  He was fucking phenomenal  Yeah  It's like that's what  A Broadway show should be  Unless it's a play  It's a one man show  It's hilarious 
[00:43:30]  It's really smart  It's just  How could you not enjoy that?  Like what do you want lady?  What do you want?  Good for Colin  What do you want?  Some dullard sitting there  With no laughs  Pontificating  He's tying in Greek culture  And caveman culture  With how we are now  It's brilliant  It's very bright  Seinfeld was there of course  You know  Sitting right to my left  Jerry and his wife  And then right in front of  Jerry was Reage  You know  They had really good seats  I saw the Colin Quinn show  I did get one celebrity photo 
[00:44:00]  Oh you did?  You know I can't  Who's this?  If he wants to show it off  This is probably a good one  It's probably a big one  A big one  Oh there you go  Simply because I like his stand up  Show it  Oh look at who it is  Oh right on  Fucking Kramer man  Michael Richards  Was there yeah  It's Kramer  Matthew Broderick was there  Ben Stiller  John Rivers  Wow star studded  For Colin's premiere  We'll never see Colin again  By the way 
[00:44:30]  I didn't even talk to him  I think he's coming in this week  Oh is he?  I think he's coming in Friday  I'll be gone  I know you're doing your LA thing  Your little LA thing  You do from time to time  I was online  Because when I got there  They were like  Oh Mr. Norton  Here's your tickets  The lady came up to me outside  She said would you like  To do an interview  So I interviewed with Colin's  I guess website  Which was streaming  And then she goes here  And then she puts me  On the red carpet line  And Joan Rivers was ahead of me  So I'm like  Oh I guess I'm after Joan  And I look up ahead  And I see some comedians I know  And then Jerry walks in the door 
[00:45:00]  But no one's telling me where to go  So I'm just standing there  Like a lump  Oh no  And then Ben Stiller walks up  And they just walk him right by me  And I'm like  This is why I hate the red carpet  Oh because you don't know what to do  It was humiliating  I didn't even stop for photos  I just walked behind them  And went into the door embarrassed  Oh Jimmy  I'm so bad on the red carpet  It's terrible  I did at the after party  I got my picture taken a little bit  But I stopped there for a second  And no cameras went off  And I was so embarrassed  And then one guy was like 
[00:45:30]  Move over a little bit  And then they did  Oh  I was underdressed  I had on my ripped jeans  I know  I wasn't thinking that it was Broadway  No it's Broadway  It's a premiere  It's a big night  Why don't we belong in that world  It's just there's no way  We fit in that world  I just wasn't thinking  It's like I know it's a Broadway premiere  I should have dressed  Yeah  But I just was like  I'm going to see Colin  Good for Colin  Can you imagine  Tremendous  Can you imagine the nerves  It's opening night on Broadway  And he's got all those huge fucking names 
[00:46:00]  In the audience  Colin's a constant professional  He was so  He deserved every laugh he got  And he fucking slayed  Yeah  It was really  It was from beginning to end  It was really smart  Really funny  I want to see that show  It's like what do people want  It's like  It's more than stand up  Because stand up is just you there  With no background  It's got context  But this has a much broader context  A little multimedia extravaganza  It was so well done man  It's very smart  Yeah  It's very smart the material 
[00:46:30]  He looked completely relaxed on stage  Awesome  Completely relaxed  No heckling  No dumb interrupting  Like you see in a club  Oh god that's right  No one's going to heckle  On a Broadway stage  It looked like Regis was loving it too  What do you mean  No one's going to heckle  On a Broadway stage  One of our most famous bits  On a Broadway stage  Regis seemed like he was enjoying it too  Did we have that audio?  Was he enjoying it?  Yeah  He's too busy talking about  What he's going to have for breakfast  That's because I actually  Remember  A lot of the subjects  He's talking about 
[00:47:00]  I'm old  Get it?  Very very good  Piece of work  I was very happy for him  Yeah  If anybody deserves it  It's Kyle  Oh yeah  He's been in the trenches  For a long time  He lost a lot of weight  I was so annoyed  At my fat stomach  Looking at him all thin  On Broadway  AIDS  We'll get a Broadway show  And then you'll be svelte  I have an idea  Oh  One man show  No  I'm going to  I'm going to call it  A short story long  And tell the whole thing  In 200 minutes 
[00:47:30]  I don't know  I got just working on that  But I didn't like it  I didn't understand  It was stupid  Because I kept trying to heckle  And stuff  Oh  You wanted to be  Like part of the show  Yeah  Like he said Greeks  I was like  Uh oh  We know what they do  Oh  What do they do  You know  Stick it in their butts  And stuff  I was just trying  To get him going  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Get him on another  You know  Another idea track  Yeah  Instead of what he's  Talking about  But he wasn't talking about  Like I thought he was  Going to talk about 
[00:48:00]  Like Lindsay Lohan  And like tits  So I didn't think  It was good  Oh  Yeah  Stupid  Stupid  What do you mean Greeks  They're all dead  They should talk about  Someone who's alive  That even my friend  Was cracking up  It must be nice  To be able to take a pause  Like a pause  And not have to worry  That someone's going to  Yell something out  No it was  Not even one cell phone  Went off  It was  I was surprised  That there was no announcement  Yeah  I guess opening night  Everybody there knows  I think Broadway people  Just know what to do 
[00:48:30]  You know how to  You know  Sometimes  Unless they're out of towners  Yeah  That were given  Complimentary tickets  Nothing was better  Nothing was better  Than when  Cats was  Had ran  Its fucking course  And was just there  So Japanese businessmen  Could fall asleep  In the audience  Oh was that bad  Yeah that's exactly  What it turned into  I'm surprised  I didn't get hungry  I was very happy  For  That's good Jimmy  For  For Carl 
[00:49:00]  It's a tremendous thing  It's at the Helen Hayes Theater  What an amazing  Performance space too  Like I'm watching  Like this is the perfect place  To do what he's doing  Because the stage  Is like a Greek  It looks almost Greek  It's got like a bunch of steps  People fucking each other  In the ass  That's what happened  At the after party  And  It was just tremendous  How many seats  I don't know  A few hundred  Six hundred maybe  I mean it was  The perfect size  Nice size theater  Yeah  Good  So if you're in New York  It's at the Helen Hayes Theater  It's not running for that long  A couple of months 
[00:49:30]  Maybe six weeks  Eleven weeks  Oh eleven weeks  That's even better than I thought  So  I guess  About two months  A little more I guess  I think Colin Quinn on Broadway  Long story short  But I was blown away  Again  Because I saw the show  There was a lot of different material  And a lot of the stuff  Oh you had a material?  Yeah  Let me see my picture  There's Jimmy  That was me  At the after party  Oh you can't get to it  Can you?  Well let me see  What website did Jimmy make?  Well that's Wire Image  That's just Wire Image  Wow  Wire Image  People are going to be purchasing that picture 
[00:50:00]  To put on their blogs  Oh  Danielle Staub  I saw her  I knew I recognized her  I didn't know who  Who else was there?  Because there's some people  Oh Kathy Griffin said hello too  She's very nice  She was very sweet  Yeah was she nice?  Very nice yeah  Ben Stiller  Matthew Broderick  I love Broderick too  He's a nice guy  Jerry  Oh Lorraine Brocco  I didn't know she was there  Fucking Lorraine Brocco  She looks good man  What the fuck  She's an old lady too right?  And Ben Stiller yeah  A little Jerry Seinfeld action  Who else?  I'm surprised  Oh Tom Papa 
[00:50:30]  The nerve of him  Look at Tom Papa  Who else?  Tom Kitt  I don't know Tom  Who else was that?  Oh composer  Yeah it was great  Right on man  We'll have Colin in later this week  To talk about the big  Colin is a bum  Yes  A bum on Broadway though  But a real victory  And I'm glad  I know Variety wrote it up nice  It got some great reviews  Ah it got written up in Variety  I know you guys beat the shit out of each other  And it's the thing you do  But I'm so happy for him 
[00:51:00]  I so am I  Because I remember like five six years ago  He would come into our show at the other studio  So frustrated  Remember he would tell us he has all these ideas  And he needs someone to organize his ideas  He's got hundreds and hundreds of hours of stuff that he's written  Yeah  And he was just so frustrated  Because he knew he had something  But he just needed someone to help him out a little bit  And now fast forward a few years  He's on Broadway with it  A lot of things on Broadway I think that are supposed to be funny  Are tongue in cheek  Or they're over the top 
[00:51:30]  I don't think that's the answer  Ah shut up  It's fucking drivel  Like this is really smart  It's not oversold  It's just  It was so great to watch  A stand up  But again  This would be hard to do in a club like this  Because there was so much more to it  Than just  Trying to get  Trying to hold people's attention  When they're drinking  And ordering food  Right right  Paying their bills  Yeah yeah  Can you imagine  Fucking  Jesus  But this dumb lady  Elizabeth said it was just stand up  But it was more than stand up 
[00:52:00]  Because I've seen the stuff that was stand up in it  Yeah  And I know what the difference is  And it was  There's definitely a difference  It incorporated a whole  A bigger picture  And it made sense  And it was really well done  And it was hilarious  Fucking destroyed  What does she know  Alright why don't we take a break  Very good  Alrighty  We got someone from the Navy  That wants to explain the missile  Hopefully he can  Stay through the break  Hope it's the guy from the village people  You can sail the seven seas  In the Navy  We all drop to our knees  In the Navy  You can catch a communicable disease  In the Navy  We got Cain Velasquez 
[00:52:30]  Velasquez  Velasquez  Yes he's coming in  I'm trying to get a UFC glove  To get him to sign  I'm such a dummy  I forgot to ask someone yesterday  He's the UFC champion  And we got him on the show today  8 o'clock  He was the one that beat Brock Lesnar  Yes  Yes he did  He's a bad dude man  And a big star  And a very funny dude  Jim Gaffigan  Oh is Jim coming in good  Stopping by to say hi  One of our  The very pale  Jim Gaffigan  Yeah  And other things  I don't know  We'll figure it out  This music just reaches white people 
[00:53:00]  Oh it's great  Like soul reaches black people  Yes  This just talks to white people  Do you think black people like Metallica  Some do  I'm sure some appreciate  My ex-girlfriend was very into R&B  Yeah  And she was like  She was listening to Metallica  With me in the car  She was like 
[00:53:30]  People actually danced to it  Like she like loved it  She couldn't believe how good the beats were  So I'm sure if they hear it  They like it  Alone  When they're not with their black friends  Yeah  They won't admit in front of a bunch of other homies  If they're listening to  For whom the bell tolls  Yeah this shit is great  Alright Navy guy  Did stay through the commercials  Dan in Georgia  Talk about that missile in California  And you might have something on that Dan  Yeah I used to shoot the missiles off the carriers  I did two carrier tours  I was a TAO  Which stands for Tactical Action Officer  I know 
[00:54:00]  So it's virtually impossible  To accidentally shoot a missile  So if the Navy was shooting a missile  They were shooting it on purpose  But I'm not saying that  It can't you know  Accidentally go somewhere  Where it's not supposed to go  Ah  Alright so  So it wasn't a mistake  There are  There are physical blocks  To the actual mounts  Like a safety  On one of ants guns  And  And a guy has to go out  And actually pull that safety out  Then there's three different dudes 
[00:54:30]  That have to turn keys  So  You can't accidentally shoot a missile  You have to purposely shoot a missile  Wait that turn your key sir  Is a real thing  It really is  It's not as gay as in the movie  Okay  Right  But it's just everybody  You know  You actually yell out  Turn keys  And everybody turns their keys  What if  Honestly though  What if someone doesn't  Will they shoot you  What's that  What happens if someone doesn't  Turn the key  Will they shoot you  Or just go move  And put someone else there  Yeah  They just go  Get out of the way  Get away  Get out of the way  Stupid  Get out of the way  Get out of the way  Get fired  Go home early 
[00:55:00]  Dan I'm sure you saw the video  What do you think  Is it a missile  Is it a plane  What's your thought  I'm actually an aviator  And I do ship tours  That are called  Disassociated ship tours  I know you know  Yes  But  I did that  But  I've seen a lot of weird shit  Up in the air  That just looks like  Something that it's not  I've seen a perfectly shaped donut  Before  Up in the air  It was a cloud  I was like  How the hell did that get there  Iraq's dream  Showing a donut in the sky  I'm pretty sure 
[00:55:30]  I'm pretty sure  It was an airplane  That just looks  Freaking weird  Okay  Look at that  Of course  One of the gatekeepers  Man  Working for the government  Man  Hey  You know we fuck up  I mean  Remember that  Remember that Turkish  Frigate that we shot  Right in the bridge  And killed their captain  You know  Things happen  Sorry  Oops  Yeah  Sorry about that  Whoopsie daisy  So we do mess up  And so there is a slim chance  That the Navy was purposely 
[00:56:00]  Shooting a missile  Off the coast of California  That's where we do  All our workups  For crews  And we do shoot  Live missiles out there  So it's possible  That we shot one  And it didn't go  The area it was supposed  To go in  Went the other way  But the Navy  Would own up to that  They wouldn't  They wouldn't say  No one knows  Yeah  Literally hundreds  Of people that would  Know about it right away  And these little enlisted  Guys on the ship  When you're off the coast  Of California  They'll run out  Into the  Out on  Into the open air  And get on their  Cell phone right away  And call their girlfriend  And tell them  What just happened 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit  We just launched  The fucking missile  It didn't go  Where it was supposed  To go  You wouldn't be able  To cover it up  Here's my cock  Send me a picture  Of your pussy  You almost sound like  Bobo  As Bobo  Setting off  I'm the fugitive  Alright  There was a dog  That came up to me  A dog that came up  Was that a great moment  I almost want to hear it again  Alright  Hey Dan  Thank you for your knowledge  Yes  We're just shock jocks 
[00:57:00]  We don't know shit  I knew everything  But I said that  During the break  And Dan just repeated  The shit he overheard me  Saying through the mic  Thank you  I mean you were talking  About duties  During the break  Yeah but we were just  Saying what we enjoy  Eating when no one's looking  I'm fucking 42  Why would that be my joke  We ate duty  I suck  Because it's funny  Hey got you  To the red carpet  Last night  It certainly  Well yeah  As I ran  You should have seen  The low self esteem kid  Fucking running 
[00:57:30]  Dude I hate red carpets  Hate them  Yeah  I get so humiliated  And embarrassed  Like I don't think  Any  My publicist is very good  Amy's very good  Like she'll go  Hey that's so and so  That's so and so  And she'll get me  To talk to them  Whether or not  They use it  Is up to them  Yeah  But at least she gets me  To talk to them  But when it's just  The event publicist  And I'm there  Oh  We get it right  Oh dude  It's my nightmare  It's like waking up  On stage realizing  This is a dream  You're a fraud  Oh god  You're a fraud  Oh that sucks 
[00:58:00]  Norton  Hey um  Sam did we find  The bed bug song  No I mean  What  Fuck I wanted to  Play that so bad today  We have  I can go real quick  Burn in the song  That they did play  If you are really  In the mood  For a Scott and Todd  Parody song  It wasn't the bed bug  Song yesterday  What was yesterday's  The Facebook song  Oh you gotta get that  Is that something  You're interested in  Well Facebook  A Facebook song  Well  That keeps us very  Current and hip  Topical  I'm trying to think  We're almost hipsters 
[00:58:30]  When we talk about  Facebook  That's right  Would they do that too  Yeah  I can't  You want me to go  Grab it  Oh please  Five minutes  Must hear shoehorning  So  I was watching Oprah again  Aww  You called me a faggot  For watching Oprah yesterday  A little bit  I didn't forget  But I gotta tell you  You know  These talk show hosts  Need to tell the world  It's their last year  Because they get everybody  Yeah yeah  Like today is the big  Talk show reunion 
[00:59:00]  What do you mean  Who's  On one stage  You got Oprah  Phil Donahue  Ricky Lake  Sally Jesse Raphael  Geraldo  And they threw  Montel Williams in there  Oh I can't throw them  No Springer  And they're all  No Springer  That's right  Oh I think  I think  The whole thing  Was talk show hosts  That are no longer doing it  You know  To give Oprah  A little advice  About retiring or something  I don't know  And they all drink  A little champagne  At the end of the hour  But yesterday 
[00:59:30]  Oprah had fucking  George Bush on  And I gotta tell you  Something man  I was never a Bush fan  At all  And mostly because  Of his personality  I'm not a politics guy  For the most part  But I always thought  He was just as stiff  In office  On Oprah  He came across  So fucking likable  And I'm thinking to myself  Where was this guy  When he was in the White House  Yeah  And I'm not talking  Policies please  I'm just saying  As a human being  He came across  Very likable  On Oprah  The thing about those guys  Is they're so  Any one of those guys 
[01:00:00]  Could win you over  Obama  If Obama had five minutes  Alone with Anthony  He could win them over  Oh really  These guys are masters  At bringing you in  They talk about  These weird things  Clinton would do  Like he touches  Daryl Hammond told me that  Because he did shit  With Clinton in the White House  Why talk to Daryl Hammond  When you could talk to me  I met Clinton  And he did touch me  On the shoulder  I felt blessed  I'm mentioning the things  That Clinton said about you  Actually  Oh  I'll touch that boy  He ran up into the apple tree 
[01:00:30]  No but you're right  Clinton just has a way about him  He invades your space  They all know  How to just  Their whole job  Is to win you over  And I'm not saying  They're being insincere  They're just those  Type A people  Right  Who can just fucking  Dominate you by talking  I certainly was suspicious  By the whole thing  Because obviously  He wants to sell some books  But he wasn't like  In the White House  Right  Is what it is  But he won the elections  To get elected he was  Yeah  Yeah  A lot of that had to do with  You know 9-11  And people going like  I don't know  You don't want to  Get a new guy in there 
[01:01:00]  He had explanations  For some tough fucking questions man  Whether  You know  And then of course  You watch  She had plenty of time  To think about it  Then you watch  You know  Whatever  Some of these talk show  Fucking assholes  And they have to  It's just so exhausting  I don't even want to talk about it  I just stopped myself  It's exhausting  I do like Bush though  As a guy  Like he's  If I had to interview  Any ex-president  It would probably be him  He  As far as Katrina goes  And flying over Katrina  He said  Yeah I made a mistake  I should have landed  You know 
[01:01:30]  Because that famous picture  Of him looking out  The fucking airplane  Whatever  Air force one  But it was all wet down there  I should have landed  But he said  Which makes sense  He said  You know  When a president lands  It takes all the resources  To protect the president  It's just how it is  Right  And he felt like  All the resources needed  Were needed somewhere else  And not for him to land  Just to make a statement  That I'm here for you  That was his explanation  That ain't bad  He's had a few years  To think that one up  That's pretty good 
[01:02:00]  Probably  But that was his  Reasoning yesterday  On Oprah for the most part  How'd she treat him?  I thought she would get  I thought she should have  Been tougher with him  She kind of let him  Off the hook a little bit  You know  She was alright  It was a really good interview  It was a great hour  He's not a sitting president  Anymore  So it's like  Why lay into him  She asked about Sarah Palin  And all this  And he's like  I don't want to be  Dragged back into this crap  He basically doesn't want  Anything to do  He's saying that now  With politics  Yeah he hasn't bash Obama  He doesn't bash Obama 
[01:02:30]  No  He says the guy  Has a tough job  I've been there  He doesn't bash the guy  And he knows  He left him a mess  And he did  In certain areas  He left him a mess  And I think he said  That he did not  Understand how bad  The economy was going  To get at the end  You know  And maybe Ant said  That yesterday  Am I just repeating  What Ant said yesterday  I'm sorry  I'll say yes  You are  Because it was really stupid  Wait a minute  Now hold on  We got the audio  When he talked to Matt Lauer  I didn't see that interview  And then he was on Hannity last night  I did not see Hannity last night 
[01:03:00]  Oh I didn't see that  They didn't do that in Texas  I'm guessing  Right  That was not in Hannity's studio  No  Did you watch it?  No but I saw a clip of it  And Sean and him  Were sitting at the table  Yeah  It was a recorded piece  Wow we were like  One step removed from Bush  Because we know Hannity  And Hannity knows Bush  Wow  This is that Kevin Bacon thing  But in real life  Well McCain too  And McCain  We're like  We're going to be asked  He knows them all  We're going to be asked  To the White House soon  Oh you think so? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah man  We're one  One removed  Don't just show up  Thinking you're going to be asked  By the way  They frown on that  I was almost friendly  With a president's daughter  God damn it  Megan McCain and I  We get along very well  Oh really?  Yeah  I just wish that her dad  Would have won  Because I'd be like  I'd have access to the White House  Not a lot of access  But maybe some  My brother tried to pick up  Chelsea Clinton  At a bar once  Not well at all  Yeah  He doesn't think it would 
[01:04:00]  He pushed though  He was using  He was using that  Hughes charm  Oh yeah?  Yeah  It didn't work out  Didn't work out for him  Maybe he'll tell the story  If he comes out of hiding  My brother's in hiding  I don't know why  On the lamb?  I don't know  Hope not  Because the lamb  Is probably going to  Have his back be sore  That's a good one  I know it is  Hopefully he'll figure it out  I know it is  Hey Matt Lauer  Talking to George Bush  Yes  You want a little clip here? 
[01:04:30]  Sure  You hear about the fetus thing?  Yes  I told you that yesterday  You did right?  Yes  Jimmy was talking about that yesterday  Where the fuck was I?  I said that's why he was pro-life  Because his mother brought the fetus  And the  Well let him say it  Yeah  Barbara Bush was on Oprah a little bit  It was a tape piece  And wow  She seems like a tough broad man  A tough mom  Really?  A bitch on wheels  She seems to be the real leader  Of that entire family  When you look at  It's fucking  George  Was president for four years  Head of the CIA 
[01:05:00]  Vice president for eight  George Jr.  President for eight years  Governor of Texas  Jeb  Governor of Florida  That is the most powerful family  In the country  Yeah that is  Sure  And she is  A dynasty  And she seems to be  The toughest one of all  And George Bush  Looked like  He was 12 years old  When they were interviewing  Him and his parents  In Maine  Oh they talked to him  And his parents together?  In Maine  Yeah  Oh  You know  At the summer home there  Kingdom of Bunkport  That's right  Who did Oprah?  I guess Oprah  Didn't feel like going up to Maine  It was one of those pieces 
[01:05:30]  Where it was obvious  That Oprah wasn't there  Oh  Why wouldn't you go to Maine  And fucking hang out with them  For your TV show  She is Oprah though  She's met them all  And who knows  Maybe she had to take a dump  She just brought  She just  She sent the B team  Wow  Get some video  For the big interview  That was on Oprah yesterday  I want to get Barbara Bush  Or yeah  I have not  Yeah  Maybe we could get that  From Oprah yesterday  Yeah  Demeaning her son  Well I mean  Her son was  They showed that in  In the movie W 
[01:06:00]  Yeah  That the mother was very overbearing  And really like  Nasty  Wow really  Yeah  And Bush looks like  I don't know  He gives me the impression  That he never wanted to be president  And he's so happy  He's not there anymore  He's gotta be  That's my dumb  Stupid thought  That he isn't president  I was looking at him yesterday  Going  This guy I don't think  Ever wanted that  Maybe he felt the pressure  Of his mom  And his father  And all that crap  Who knows  You gotta wonder  How many presidents  Loved the campaigning 
[01:06:30]  The competitiveness of it  And then winning  And then was just like  Oh fuck  Now I'm the president  And now I have to like  Go to work  And do things  And be responsible  For the country  Yeah  It's like fuck that man  But they like  They like the competition  Of the campaigning  And getting the gig  And getting there  I think Obama  I think that had a lot  To do with Obama  He loved that whole thing  And then he got in  And it's like  Oh shit 
[01:07:00]  Now what  He looks like  A much different person  Too doesn't he  Oh my god  They showed a picture  I'm not even talking  About the gray  And all that  I'm just talking  In his eyes  He just looks like  A different person  Yeah  Oh here it is  Oh Bush  Family Summer Home  On Oprah  Oprah.com by the way  George and George Sr.  In a boat  Summer day  In Kennebunkport, Maine  You're likely to find 
[01:07:30]  The two presidents  Here on the water  You can see the  Secret service boat  Behind a submarine  Quality time  With me and my brothers  And my sister  This is where  Five generations  Of the Bush family  Have spent their summers  At the 108 year old  Estate known as  Walker's Point  Back in 1902  Mr. Walker  My grandfather  My namesake  Built this house  And we love it  There's a nine bedroom  Main house  Damn  A cluster of smaller 
[01:08:00]  Guest colleges  Kramer burnt it down  With a cigar  And a pool  The grandfather  All the cousins  Come  Truthfully  There are hundreds of them  She looks exactly  It's a wonderful family place  It's a wonderful family place  It's a beautiful place  And it's where you find peace  Yep  Growing up with mother and dad  Was an interesting experience  I adored my father  And my mother  I adored her too  But she tended to be the enforcer  And I tended to test her 
[01:08:30]  I was a lively lad  And I inherited a lot  Of her feistiness  When I was campaigning  For governor  I would tell people  Of Texas  I had my daddy's eyes  In my mother's mouth  You should be so lucky  See what I'm talking about  We could have some  Wonderful battles  But never let us down  I mean he  He was a very sweet son  It's only happened twice  In history  That a father and son  Have served as president  And it's made for a rare bond 
[01:09:00]  Between 41 and 43  On the day of George W's  First inauguration  He and his father  Met in the Oval Office  It was a powerful moment  We didn't say much  To each other  No  I said  He said Mr. President  I said welcome Mr. President  Very emotional  And wonderful  And rewarding  About pride  And a guy that set out  To do something  And did it  It's wonderful  When it comes to criticism  Of either presidency 
[01:09:30]  The Bush family  Closes ranks  You're in it yourself  You get used to  To some degree  But it's much more difficult  To hear when somebody  Attacks your son  Ours is not a  Political affiliation  Ours is an affiliation  Based upon pure love  And so when you see  Somebody you love  Get hammered in the press  It is a painful experience  When you yourself  Get hammered in the press  It really means nothing  That's just part of the job  Unfairly  I appreciate you saying that mom 
[01:10:00]  Six fish children  And 17 grandchildren  Perhaps  There's a possibility  Of a third president  Bush in the family  I don't think so  But I wish there was  I think people are  Bushed right now  Yeah but that's  Going away fast  I was hoping my brother  Jed wouldn't run frankly  But he's not going to  So he'd have been  A good president  Been a great president  But he's  He won't run  I've talked to him about it  And he's talked to him about it  But we have other  Other children 
[01:10:30]  Maybe we have the first  Girl president  Who knows  Mom I hope you're not  Announcing your candidacy  Oh yes  Woo  Holy shit  Yeah that's an insight  He's a hoot  It's an insight  To their relationship though  I mean if he's calling her  Feisty  You know he wants to  Call her something else  Bitch  Because she's the one  Person on earth  Who probably at a table  Full of people would go  Would you shut up  Yeah  She's gotten to  Fucking boss around  Two presidents  Oh yeah 
[01:11:00]  She's the most  Connected broad  A lot  I love how you think  Hillary's the most  Powerful woman  No  No  That woman is  Connected  Yeah  And at what age  Did she stop aging  I mean all those  Old jokes about  Barbara Bush  But she hasn't  Aged since then  At all  She got old  At a very early age  And now it just  Looks exactly the same  And it stops  It's really strange  They look very accessible  Even though they're not  They're surrounded  Constantly by armed protection  Oh yeah  But they look like  People that you could meet  Right 
[01:11:30]  They really do look accessible  Normal folk  Because you're seeing them  With a parent and son  You normally don't see that  With presidents  Yeah  The other thing about  George Bush  He looks a lot younger  Yeah  Since he left office  He looks like relaxed  Doesn't he  Yeah  Do you guys want to hear  This clip about  The fetus thing  That Jimmy brought up yesterday  One of them is a poignant story  What year was the father president  Was it 88 to 92 right  Wait say that again  88 to 92 would be  George was 41  George Sr  Wow  He hasn't been president  For 18 years  Yeah  And how old is he 
[01:12:00]  He's ancient  He's in his 80s I think  He's easily in his 80s  85 maybe  Maybe yeah  He is really old  Oh yeah yeah  But he doesn't look really old  Those guys all last in  In their 80s  Because they have great health care  And they get checked up constantly  That is true  Yeah yeah  Constantly being pawed over  By doctors  Yes  Unless of course  They comb their hair  With a fucking  You know  Fucking Oswald  Yes  Couldn't think of a way  To say that  With an Oswald  With an Oswald  Comb your hair  With an Oswald  He's 86  86  And Barbara Bush 
[01:12:30]  Is what  101  She built that house  Actually  She was 30  One of them is a poignant story  You tell about your mom  About your mom having a miscarriage  When you were just a teenager  Yeah  And you were the one  Who drove her to the hospital  And you write  Quote  I never expected to see  The remains of the fetus  Which she had saved in a jar  To bring to the hospital  There was a human life  A little brother or sister  You and she had never 
[01:13:00]  Talked publicly about this story  Until she gave you permission  Right  To write about it  In this book  And that's why  You're asking me  Because had my mother said  Son I don't know  When you're talking about it  It wouldn't have been in the book  I put the story in the book  As a part of the tale  I thought it was very important  For people to understand  My relationship with my mom  What did you learn about her  Through that experience?  One she trusted me  And when you're a teenage kid  You know  You're kind of  Self-absorbed person  And your mom says  I trust you  It's a boost in confidence  And my mom said 
[01:13:30]  I mean  What I learned  Was she's a straightforward person  Right  He says to her teenage kid  Here's a fetus  It's also though  Impossible not to draw parallels  Between that moment  Where you said  This was a little brother  Or sister  And your views  On life  That's true  And when it begins  No question  That affected me  My philosophy  That we should respect life  And I was a pro-life president  But the purpose of the story  Really wasn't  To try to show  The evolution  Of a pro-life point of view 
[01:14:00]  It was really to show  How my mom and I  Developed a relationship  Yeah  He doesn't want to discuss  Politics at all  Anymore man  I developed a relationship  By cleaning our shoes off  Wow  Jimmy just walks away  Shaking his head  You notice how  Matt Lauer  Was trying to make that  Political  And he's like  Look it's just a story  About me and my mom  Matt's a good interviewer  Though man  I'm done with that shit  I think he does a good job  Like with  With really powerful people 
[01:14:30]  Like he didn't take any shit  From Tom Cruise  He's good with Obama  I think he's good with Bush too  I thought he was being glib  With Tom Cruise  To tell you the truth  He was being glib  It's fucking glib  Didn't Cruz say that  Tell him you're being glib  You're being glib  He doesn't tolerate any shit  Though Matt Lauer  No  Nah  You call it a West Texas expression  About guys who drink  And you said  Last night he thought  He was a 10  In fact  He was an ass  That's right  Does that describe  How you get on occasions 
[01:15:00]  Yeah I did  Sometimes  Absolutely  I said some stupid things  Tell me the story  About the dinner party  Okay so here's one of the worst  That's what we want  We want the worst  Well you found it  Yeah  So I'm drunk  At the dinner table  At Mother and Dad's house  In Maine  And my brother's  And sister there  Laura's there  And I'm sitting next  To a beautiful woman  Friend of Mother and Dad's  And I said to her  Out loud  What is sex like  After 50  Silence  I mean total silence  And not only silence 
[01:15:30]  But like serious daggers  From your mom  Yeah  And my wife  Jesus  Holy shit  What's sex like  After 50  And he said  And he said that  When he got  He turned 50  That woman sent him a note  And said  Well George  What's it like  Wow  I guess when you become  The president  People forgive your  Indiscretions  Your dopey  Drunken moments  At the table  Done with the Bush clips  Or you want to hear  About Katrina  I wouldn't mind  Hearing the Katrina clip  We could all make love  So many times 
[01:16:00]  In the book  You take pride  In the fact  That you as a president  Were someone who  Went out there  And took decisive action  Whether it was  Controversial  Or second guessed  Or not  You took decisive action  And Katrina  Was one of those  Examples where  You didn't  Yes  The lack of  Crisp response  Was a failure  At all levels  Of government  You're tough  In the book  On the former  Governor of Louisiana  Kathleen Blanca  You're tough  On Ray Nagin  You say after  Four days  It was clear to you  That the state  And local leaders  In Louisiana  Could not lead  Well I don't think 
[01:16:30]  I was tough  I think I was fair  I say to  A room full  Of Louisiana  Politicians  Who is in charge  Of security  I say this to the mayor  And he says to the governor  And I say to the governor  Who's in charge of security  And I get no answer  Then you went on to say  She dragged her feet  She for a couple of days  Could not decide  Whether she would allow you  Or request you  To send government troops  In  Correct  And so here's the decision  I faced  In order to restore order  Some said  Send in federal troops  The problem is 
[01:17:00]  Unless those troops  Are requested by the governor  And or I declare  An insurrection  Right  Those troops  Would have to go  Into what appeared  To be  A very violent situation  Without the ability  To defend themselves  What's fascinating  In the book  You actually say  You went through  The thought process  How's it going to look  If a republican  President  Usurps the authority  Of a democratic governor  And declares  An insurrection  In a largely  African American city  Yeah it wouldn't have  Gone bad  I mean it would have  Like kerosene  On fire 
[01:17:30]  See that's  Never been a clusterfuck  That goes with  A lot of the things  You were saying yesterday  Anthony  That in the end  You just realize  That people aren't  Fucking prepared  For major disasters  And you can't just  Send in the army  Into a state  It's kind of  You know  Against the rules  You can't just do that  I didn't know that  I thought the president  Could just say  Hey get your fucking  Get in there  Into Louisiana  Simple as that  Listen to these excuses  Apologists 
[01:18:00]  Oh sure  I don't know  Who would say  That we're apologists  I don't think so  What us  Yeah  Or Bush  It's somebody  Commenting over here  I guess Bush  Yeah  Yeah sure  Maybe he's just  Trying to sell books  I don't know  Don't they all do that  Like what do you think  Nixon did  After he was president  Came around  And admitted everything  He had apologized  To Frost  But for the country  There was a total breakdown  Of local government  As far as that's concerned  To us  You know  Like Ray Nagin  Was an incompetent  They sucked  What an incompetent mayor 
[01:18:30]  I still think Bush  Handled that badly  And I still think  He should have done much more  Absolutely  You know  Might as well play  The last clip we got here  Because it's the Kanye West  Thing that we went over  Yesterday  Kanye  With Mike  Poor Mike Myers  Mike Myers  With his  What the fuck  Are you doing look  Yeah  Do yourself a favor  And go and check out  That clip  It's been a while  But you gotta see  How Mike Myers  Had no fucking idea  That Kanye West  Was gonna say  What he said that day  About a week after  The storm hit  NBC aired a telethon 
[01:19:00]  Yes  Asking for help  For the victims of Katrina  We had celebrities  Coming in to ask for money  And I remember it vividly  Because I hosted it  And at one part of the evening  I introduced Kanye West  Were you watching?  Nope  Remember what he said?  Yes I do  He called me a racist  Well what he said was  George Bush doesn't care  About black people  That's because he's a racist  And I didn't appreciate it then  And I don't appreciate it now  It's one thing to say  You know  I don't appreciate  The way he's handled  His business  It's another thing 
[01:19:30]  To say this man's a racist  I resent it  It's not true  And it was one of the most  Disgusting moments  Of my presidency  This is from the book  And I faced a lot of  Criticism with the president  I didn't like hearing  People claim that I lied  About Iraq's weapons  Of mass destruction  Or cut taxes  To benefit the rich  But the suggestion  That I was racist  Because of the response  To Katrina  Represented an all time low  Yeah I still feel that way  As you read those words  Felt them when I heard them  Felt them when I wrote them  And I felt them  When I'm listening to them  You say you told Laura 
[01:20:00]  At the time  It was the worst moment  Of your presidency  It's funny  Hearing him say that  He sounds fucking pissed  Like it happened yesterday  When you read  Worst moment of my presidency  You think like  Oh he's really sad  And contrite  No no  But he wants to spit  On Kanye for that  He's just pissed  Like you piece of shit  He's  His whole body  Oh what's that  His whole body language changed  When you started asking him  About that  Like as soon as he brought  The talent down  That's why he said  Did you watch it  No  Like he was just  He was angry  Yeah he liked being  Called a racist  Oh boy  Think he has any 
[01:20:30]  Kanye West CDs  I mean College Dropout  Is a really good album  Called the disgusting  Most disgusting moment  Of my presidency  Disgusting moment  And then Obama  Called Kanye a jackass  And he didn't know  He was mic'd  Yeah  That nice young woman  Is accepting an award  And that jackass  Runs up  Jackass  Two presidents in a row  Think this guy's  A fucking asshole  Everyone who follows him  On Twitter  Thinks he's a fucking asshole  He is an asshole  He's gonna have  He's gonna have  A weird accident man 
[01:21:00]  He went on a  Twitter rant  He's gonna have  A weird accident  Oh did he about  What Bush road  No he went on  A Twitter rant  Last night  Oh did he  I guess he taped  An interview  With the Today Show  He must have  Cause he started  Kanye right  Yeah he did an interview  With Matt Lauer  And they were asking him  About I guess Bush  Or whatever  And they started playing  The MTV clip under  While he was talking  Like they do  You know  They like  Split screen  Or whatever  And he got real pissed off  He's saying he's not  Gonna do interviews anymore  Why he said it  He didn't like the way 
[01:21:30]  They showed it  While he was talking  I feel very alone  Very used  Very tortured  Very forced  Very misunderstood  Very hollow  Very very misused  Oh Kanye is a fucking  Suburban white girl  Jesus Christ  Congratulations  You have the angst  Of a white girl  White teenager  In the suburbs  You idiot  Shut up  I went there  To express  How I was empathetic  To Bush  Because I labeled  Him a racist  And years later  I got labeled  As a racist  While I was trying 
[01:22:00]  To give the interview  They started playing  The MTV  Under my audio  I don't mess  With Matt Lauer  Or the Today Show  And that's a very nice  Way for me to put it  I don't blame them  For being annoyed  About that though  It's like we hate  When they run  Like music beds  It's like if you're  Explaining something  And they're playing  Everyone knows the incident  That's unnecessary  Right  I would annoy me too  That's just some  Producer trying to  Produce this  But he's just an ass  Yeah he is an ass  I'm not a fan  Of Kanye West  What so ever 
[01:22:30]  In reference to  Michael Jackson  Maybe Mike could have  Explained how the media  Tried to set him up  It's all a fucking  Set up  Whatever  Saying that they  Were trying to force  That's what I said  A set up  Whatever  I still like Kanye  Musically he's great  I mean you can't say  He's not good  He's very good man  I hate him  And I don't like him  And I think his music  Is good  Yeah  Did you say musically  Because I got a Facebook  Parody song  Right in front of my face  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah 
[01:23:00]  You can call him  Ray Nagin  Parody here  Parody here  I mean yeah  Kanye West is good  But he's not Scott and Todd  Scott and Todd  Rule when it comes  To song parodies  There is no one better  By the way  So what is this  One about  Oh that idiot  What is this song  About the Facebook  Weird Al better  Get out of the way  Giant melting Facebook  Where are we gonna  Another song  I went to  It was my girlfriend

[01:30:00]  Here's the story  Oh no  Of a man named Bret Hart  Oh no  Oh no  This is funny  He's been in something  Like five million matches  Oh  I got that from the face  Okay  Ahmed Johnson  Jake the snake  Horowitz  You take the cake  Hunter Hurst  Hemsley  And Savio  And you shake and bake  Backland crawling on his knees  How long is this fucking song 
[01:30:30]  It's almost gone  Well this is a tale about  Camp Cornette  The polyester king  With Owen Bader  And the dog  It's a not so nice thing  I can't take this  They scream and yell in Los Angeles  I heard him from afar  Cause Cornette would only rent  A midsize rent a car  We love the  Superstar  That's the big finish  Superstar  He stinks 
[01:31:00]  So come on  Let's start the show  And fire up the burner  Screw you Ted Turner  It's time to start the show  The slamming show  What a twat  Wow  I  I  You're covering your face  You got your shoulders up to your ears  You alright over there?  I can't take things like that  You know what it's funny?  It's so embarrassing  To watch  When I was a kid  Oh what's that Samuel? 
[01:31:30]  When I was a kid watching that?  Yeah  I thought that song was the shit  That shit is hilarious  Were you like laughing?  Yeah what he said about Paul Bearer  Yoko Zuna  I was trying to memorize the words  No  Oh my god  You're such a jerk  You stink  I had the slammy awards on tape  Well  Watch Scott's song  Or Todd's song again  Oh god  It's awful  I bet he was real proud of it 
[01:32:00]  Thinking he was having a Billy Crystal moment  This is it  Where Billy would open up the Oscars  He did the same exact thing  He's feeling good about himself  Probably got off a stage  And everybody was like  Wow  That was a great job  No  You nailed it  You nailed it  Vince probably started yelling at him  What the hell was that?  He just yells at everyone  What are you doing  Putting everybody's name in a song?  You told me to  You know what the turnaround is  When wrestlers hear?  It was dated before you finished 
[01:32:30]  The goddamn song  I fired half those people  And now you're  Ha  Every wrestler says  That like they get told to do stuff  And then they go and do it  Like once they quit  When they come in and do interviews  They say  They get told to do stuff  And then they keep doing it  Until one day  They start getting yelled at  For doing what they were told to do  Unbelievable  We gotta cut this short  Because we got Cain coming in  I wanna take a break  Before he does that  And people just yelling  Jocktober's over  God damn it  Ah well  You know  Hey man 
[01:33:00]  Song parodies  They gotta do song parodies  They transcend Jocktober  I still want the bed bug song  I desperately need the bed bug song  I'm on the hunt  Cain Velasquez  After the break  Cain  Velasquez  I just don't know how to say his name  No just think there's no way  It's Velasquez  It sounds like  It looks like it will be Velasquez  Spell it phonetically  Velasquez  Kez yeah  Kez  With a K  I'm gonna put a K right there  Look at what I do  Q-U-E  Is now a K  A K  And then cross out the U  Velasquez  Yeah  See how easy that is  It's easy  UFC champion 
[01:33:30]  He'll be in studio  Next  Entering the studio  UFC champion  Cain Velasquez  Oh yeah  What's up Cain  Welcome to the show brother  How are you  The champ  Good good good  Oh you're not too intimidating  Holy shit  Hey what's up Jim  And another Jim  What's up Gaffigan  Sit down brother  You know what  Anything about UFC  Ah then sit over there 
[01:34:00]  No I'm just kidding  What are you doing in New York  I'm not saying that in a confrontational way  No no  Okay  A bunch of media stuff  Gonna be on  Good day in New York  Regis and Kelly  Those kind of shows  Ah Regis  And these  You know  These ones too  Yeah  You think I could take him there Kelly  He'll be saying things like that  Yeah  And then of course you will  And then you'll just punch him in the face  I gotta be honest  Cain is the heavyweight champion 
[01:34:30]  And I was really surprised  I mean  That you did as well as you did  I mean you really  You beat Brock up  I think a lot of people were surprised  Yeah  There's no doubt about it  That you were the better man  There's that whole mystique about Brock  You had about him  You know that he could go in there  Indestructible  Kick everybody's ass  And you went in there  And wow  Schooled him  I just think  You know with the hard training camp  They just prepared us really well  Went in there  And we knew what he wanted to do 
[01:35:00]  As far as  His game plan  So we went in  Prepared for the fight  Yeah  What did you think he wanted to do  Because it seems like  Brock's thing is to get on top of you  And then just use his weight  Is that what he wanted?  Yeah  We knew he wanted to do that  We knew that he would go forward  With a lot of pressure  But it kind of surprised me  How much pressure he did put on me  In the beginning  Because he ran up to me  You know  Yeah he came around  That kind of threw me off my game  A little bit  And then I just had to  You know  Tell myself in my head  Just to regroup  And then  You know  Just to relax  Was he stronger than you thought  He was going to be  Or not as strong  Because  There was one point 
[01:35:30]  Where Kane was up against the cage  Yeah  And I'm like  Oh god  Do you not want to be there  Yeah  He  I felt like he put a lot of pressure  On me against the cage  I was like  Man  I'm not going to move out of here  So I was just trying to keep him up  And not let him go down on my legs  But  He was definitely strong  I mean  He has a huge upper body  He's definitely massive  So  He also looked like  He was trying to get you down  And your speed and dexterity  You just  You jumped right back up  He could not keep you on the ground  Which I think was good for you 
[01:36:00]  I mean  The guys that we have training with us  I mean  They're Olympic style wrestlers  They're on the USA Olympic team  We have  This last year's national champion  In college  And  That's what we practiced  We practiced worst case scenarios  Where  They would start  On top of you  And the whole thing was  Just get up  Get up  Get up  I mean  The whole round of doing that  I mean  The whole training camp  I mean  Three to four months  Just  Non-stop  They take you down  With heavy guys  And you just get up  That's  I mean  Second nature  It looked like  Because Brock had you by 20  I think  244 
[01:36:30]  You are  And I want to say  He was 265  It was something like that  Yeah  I'm not sure how much he cut  If he did cut any  But he probably weighed 65  270  And so he had you by over 20 pounds  And he looked a lot  He looked like he actually was a little  Yeah he looked a little doughy  Around the midsection there  He looked like he wasn't  Oh you want to tell Brock that?  Believe me  If Brock was here  If Brock was right here  I'd go  Boy Kane got lucky  I'm not an idiot  I'm going to play back this tape  When Brock finally comes in here  I know  Hey the boys thought you looked doughy there Brock 
[01:37:00]  I'll say  You said it  Yeah no I said it  What do you think happens  Like when you guys cut weight  Then all of a sudden  Because I think Rogan told us  That you will just eat and drink  Like an animal that day  After you get to the weight  And just put 15 pounds back on  Yeah I mean  You walk around  Way much heavier than  Whatever weight you're trying to make  So I mean  Once you get all your water out of you  And everything else  You try to get as much in as you can  And I mean yeah  That pretty much brings you back 
[01:37:30]  To the weight you were at  I mean people cut  I mean a lot of weight  They're like 15-20 pounds  Below what they're supposed to be  Amazing  Were you scared walking in the ring  I wasn't scared  For me I'm always nervous  Which I think is good for me  I mean I think that gets me ready  Wasn't scared  I knew what my game plan was  And you know  And just felt ready  I just felt like it was my time  When did you know that you had him  When you were in the ring  When did you know you had him  I felt the momentum shift  Whenever I got my takedown  And he didn't get up right away 
[01:38:00]  Ah you felt that like  Yeah  I think this guy is like tired  Or I'm getting to him  Yeah he wasn't getting up right away  So I was like okay  I'm in good position now  I mean the fight's gonna turn my way now  There was one where you guys were  Again I don't know what was happening  But you turned around  And it looked like your elbow hit his  Because he had a tremendous  Dash on his cheek  Yeah I don't know how  It looked like it was accidental I think  Was it?  It looked like it was  Yeah it looked like your elbow  When you turned around  And remember when Brock did this thing  Where he kind of fell across the ring 
[01:38:30]  And he rolled  And I was like Jesus  What happened to him?  He reacted pretty much the way I would have  If you hit me  He just kind of fell  And tried to get up and fell again  But it looked like you had an accidental elbow  Okay  Yeah I kept looking at the film  And I couldn't know  I couldn't see what point in time  In the fight  Where I cut him so  Did he hurt you at all?  No he didn't hurt me at all  I mean those knees in the beginning  They were  They hit my chest  I mean  If you want to do damage on somebody  You pretty much get hit right in the stomach  Where you know  You get the air out  Or I mean in the face pretty much  In the chest 
[01:39:00]  I mean I felt it afterwards  After my body cooled down  I just  Yeah my chest was so sore  Just like getting up from laying down  That was painful  But I mean  During the fight  It's not going to hurt  No it didn't  Yeah it looked like he was a little  Kind of coming in a little bit crazy and sloppy  Like instead of  It looked almost like he just took you a little  Not because he took you lightly  But after Carwin is such an animal  And after he survived Carwin's thing  I don't think that he planned well enough  He figured he would just come in  And kind of bully you onto the ground  And fall on you  Yeah  I think he did  I think in the beginning  He just you know 
[01:39:30]  Come out  He tried to come out hard  And do as much damage as he could  I mean and  I think I mean  For me  To get me out of my game plan  You know  Because it surprised me  I was like  Whoa what is this  It was like  I blinked and he was already to me  You know  That definitely got me out of it  A little bit  Charging at you  Yeah  Imagine looking up and seeing that  Coming at you  I know  Oh my god  I couldn't imagine  Does he hit harder than other guys though  Because I don't think he's knocked anybody out  By punching him  I think his whole thing is getting people down  Yeah  How does he hit compared to other guys 
[01:40:00]  He hits hard  You know  But yeah  His thing is to get people down  And punch them  I mean  He takes people down  And he  You know  Last time when he fought Amir  He took them down  And then knocked them out  With a punch on the ground  To do that  You have a lot of power  Because  The more power you get  Is when you're standing  And you get to throw your hips  And your feet  And everything into it  When you're on the ground  You can only throw your arm into it  And your shoulder  And he knocked out Amir like that  I mean  And that just shows  He has a lot of power there  Yeah  Yeah that was an awful  Frank near beating  Because he had Frank almost 
[01:40:30]  It was like a schoolyard thing  Where Frank's arm and head  Were just showing  And Brock's fist had free range  Like what a shit place to be that is  That is really  I'll never understand that  When I'm watching  Even  Even the short little throws  That you get when you're on the ground  To the side of the face  Is like  Or the little  Or even the little kicks  How is that just not  Knocking you out  I'm just a pussy  Yeah we're pussies  I can't take  I got a glass jaw  Yeah  How good does it feel 
[01:41:00]  To be the champion  It feels good  You know  You kind of bring it in  For like  For like a week  You know  Just  Yeah  I mean  It's definitely an amazing feeling  You've been around a while  Obviously  What has changed  A lot of media  They treat you a little better  Yeah definitely  It's  Yeah  They definitely treat me better  It's  More  More attention  As far as media  More attention  As far as public attention  Yeah  Is Dana actually nicer to you now  Or like  How is Dana 
[01:41:30]  Is Dana nicer  Once you're the champion  He's always been the same  Pretty much  I mean  Yeah  He's definitely been a nice guy  But yeah  Definitely  You get treated better  All of a sudden  Are you on his private jet  Yeah  Instead of in coach somewhere  Not that far  But  That day  In Anaheim  We moved from Disneyland  Because we had to do media stuff  So we moved from there  All the way to  To Beverly Hills  So that was  That was a nice change  Oh there you go  Yeah that is a nice change  Yeah  Who do you want to fight?  I think that  Well the number one contender 
[01:42:00]  Is Junior Dos Santos  Okay  So  He'll be the next fight  Yeah  When is that going down?  We don't know yet  They haven't discussed it yet  You want some time obviously  Yeah  You're not ready to just jump  Back in the cage right away  Right?  Yeah  Well I mean  I think it'll be  It'll be around  Three or four months  I mean I'm guessing  I'm not sure  But that's what I'm thinking  Why do you guys seem to fight  So much more often?  It's amazing that UFC  Or MMA  Has such a brutal reputation  And you guys always look better  After a fight  Than a boxer does  Like you guys can fight 
[01:42:30]  A couple times a year  And you don't see these  Boxers  Boxers  Having championship matches  18 months off  Yeah  After a long championship fight  Yeah  I don't think we take as much damage  As the boxers would  I mean  Because you're on your feet  You're punching each other in the face  For 12 rounds  In this  You know  You can take the fight to the ground  Where you don't even  You don't even have to throw a punch  And you can win the fight  Yeah  Sometimes you don't even see a punch  Get thrown  Just see somebody's arm get twisted  Where it looks like  It's going to be removed  Did you think they were right? 
[01:43:00]  I was surprised that the ref stopped it  Because after the Carwin fight  Brock got  It would kind of impress me  That he took Carwin's punches  And still kept throwing them off  And still kept throwing them off  Was he really unable to defend himself  When you were hitting him?  Because he didn't seem to object  When they stopped him  Yeah  He was covered up  He wasn't thrown back  I mean  With what I learned from the Carwin fight  Was  Just don't throw punches  Just just throw them  I mean  I try to pick my shots  That's why I was trying to get  In between his arms  With the elbow  Punch around  So pretty much just took my time 
[01:43:30]  And I mean  Yeah  I was doing damage there  Yeah  You see some guys  Just start windmilling  Just for the hell of punching  Hoping something connects  But yeah  You were a lot more calculated  Looking for an opening  And then that one move  I love that  Yeah  I'm going to punch you move  And then the fist hits  And then  Oh yeah  The elbow got in there too  It's like  This long hooking  Move with the arm  That's just got to hurt  I want to say  Hardcore UFC guys  Are not surprised 
[01:44:00]  That you beat Brock Lesnar  By the way  He has a lot of skills  This Kane  Yeah  Because a lot of people  That are just starting  To get into the UFC  Were always surprised  When Brock loses  But the guys  That really know the sport  Are like  No this is no surprise at all  Kane should have won this fight  Right?  Yeah  I think  A lot of the  There was a lot of hype  Behind Brock  Yeah  A lot of the guys  Who are  I guess  What would you call them  Yeah like 
[01:44:30]  The experts  In the sport  I guess  Had me winning the fight  I wasn't sure  But yeah  I'm the kiss of death  For a fighter  I thought Brock  Was going to win  He gets it wrong  Every  Every time  I get it  I wanted  You never want  Jimmy picking you  If I pick you  You're finished  I'm the cooler  I just stand there  And ruin people's careers  I never pick a fight right  I never do  Let me go to Mike in Jersey  Mikey  What's up buddy?  Hello?  Hi Mike  Let's go Mike  You're on 
[01:45:00]  You're on  Quick question  Kane you were talking  About punching  I heard a rumor  That you have  The hardest punch  Like one of those machines  Like in Rocky 3  Where he punches that thing  Your PSI  Is like one of the  Hardest punches around  Yeah well  I watched that show  Fight Science  And ESPN  And they measured the punch  And they said that  I think it was  Kind of later wrong though  I'm not believing it  Oh really?  I'm not  Yeah  I mean  To be compared to  Mike Tyson  Those guys  No  I saw that  I don't think so  Where you  That was  That was insane 
[01:45:30]  The power though  Behind that punch  Good luck against Junior  Thank you  Regardless if it's  The hardest punch  Recorded or not  I watched that  And just went like  Oh  That's just brain damage  Right there  I would just  At what point in life  Did you know  You wanted to fight  Professionally  Like you probably  One of those guys  That was just  A guy that was  Training  But when did you  Go like  Yeah I kind of  Want this to be  In my life  Well ever since  I started wrestling  I mean  In junior high  I wanted to do that 
[01:46:00]  My whole life  You know  Maybe go  To the Olympic team  Or something like that  But once I got to  I was a junior in college  I saw this sport  And man  For me  I love wrestling  But it just wasn't  Enough for me  I wanted to hit people  I wanted to hit my teammates  The guys  That I was competing against  So I mean  I saw this sport  I was like  Man this is perfect for me  This is what I want to do  So wrestling wasn't enough  You kind of like  These fists are really being  Not put to good use  That does seem to be  The common factor  With you guys  You all love  Hitting people  Everybody that's 
[01:46:30]  Coming here  Is just like  Yeah I just enjoy  Punching people  I think we all love  Hitting people  But  It's the get hit back  Exactly  That's what you don't like  Thanks  Were you a fighter  Like in school  Anybody give you problems  You deck anybody  You just walk down the hall  And deck somebody  No  No I was  I mean  But when I was a kid  I love watching  I love watching boxing  I wanted to do that  As a kid  But just didn't do it  So  Yeah  I like this a lot better 
[01:47:00]  Anyway  I'm sure you do too  Yeah  Instead of standing there  But yeah  Like you said  Punching each other  In the face  For 15 rounds  You can take it to the floor  Yeah  There's a lot more  Aspects to this sport  I mean  The kicking  The punching  The elbows  Does that chain link  Hurt on the side  Of your face  When it's being  Because that to me  Also looks very painful  It's not  I mean  The only time  I've ever gotten hurt  With a fence  Was once I'm in practice  Somebody down  And my face  Yeah  Slid all the way down  Cheese grater 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  To the bottom  And the bottom  Had the point sticking out  So my head  Hit it  And I had like  Four stitches  Around my forehead  Was that your worst injury?  What was the worst thing  That happened to you  In the cage?  In the cage?  You know  Nothing really  I broke my hand  In the cage  But as far as  The worst stuff  Would probably be  Like during the workouts  I mean  I've gotten  Knee surgeries  Foot surgeries  Hand  Cuts all the time  I mean  It's common  Yeah 
[01:48:00]  It cuts all the time  Have you been knocked out?  No I haven't  No one's ever knocked you out?  No  Not in practice  I mean  I've got my  My bell rung definitely  You know  You see a little bit of stars  But not where  You've never been  Completely out  Wow  You've never  Been laid out  And then opened your eyes  And gone  Where am I?  Well Carwin is fighting somebody  I think Shane's a very  He's a really hard puncher  He seems like  His punches are  Extraordinarily unpleasant  He is  I think he's  Yeah  Definitely one of the  Hardest punchers  In the UFC  I mean  He has a lot of power  When he punches  And how long does it take you  When you start to train 
[01:48:30]  Because you know  It's like  You guys almost make it look  Like easy to be in shape  Like you just see these guys  Always in shape  And ready to go  And like when do you start  Like now  Will you fuck around  For a little while  And just kind of eat  What you want  And then get back  To training  Or do you just kind of  Stay trained the entire time?  Yeah usually  For me  I'll take a week  Or two weeks off  And then go back to the gym  And then start off slowly  It'll be like a whole week  Of just hitting the bag  Light workouts  Don't even practice  With the team really  Just kind of do your own thing  For like a week  And then just slowly 
[01:49:00]  Start getting back into it  And then  You know  Training camp usually  Is around like 12 weeks  So we'll train all the way up  Until then  And then that's when  That really hard  Training starts  I've always wondered this too  As somebody  I mean you may look at me  He may like  I look like a fighter  But I'm actually not  And it's weird  Asking a man  Man questions  It's like three chicks  What's it like to be strong?  What do you do?  Do you ever have to  Shit when you're fighting?  That would always  Been my greatest fear 
[01:49:30]  Besides getting beaten up  That I would have to shit  While I was fighting somebody  There's certain  In the  Like getting ready  In the back room  There's certain guys  That have certain things  To do  Rituals  Yeah well  That just don't have  Control over it  I know one guy  I'm not going to say any names  Who always throws up  In the back room  Before he goes out  Like they're just a mess  You know  They don't want to  Go out  Wow  Nervous  Yeah yeah  Really nervous  Throw up  I have another  Another guy I know  Who pees the whole time  Back there  Will not stop  Like we're about to go out 
[01:50:00]  And I'm cornering him  And he's like  Okay wait  I have to go pee again  And just boom  Non-stop  Another guy who would  Just shit back there  Yeah  Wow  And then there's one guy  Who does all of those things  At the same time  So the guy who pees  It's like a nervous thing  There's no  It's like a weird thing  You just kind of empty out  Empty out  Yeah I guess it's kind of  A nervous thing  But then once  They walk out there  They're you know  Completely different  Now Jimmy  You want to keep  Your streak alive  You've been  Putting some holds  Over the last year here  What we've done  Is we've had 
[01:50:30]  Because I'm always amazed  At the beatings  You guys take  We've had  BJ put me in a  What was it  An arm bar  I was curious  As to what that felt like  For a second  It was like  For a split second  And Jimmy went  Only because you see it  And you don't know  What it feels like  And I'm like  What is that  It wasn't like  I didn't think  He could do it  He actually did it sitting  And I have such a weak chin  He had trouble getting his leg  It was like  Humiliating for everybody  And then Randy Couture  Put me in a  Again just  I wanted to feel  What it was like  To be not choked out  But just to feel that 
[01:51:00]  And it's really  Fucking horrible  Jimmy lasted  A half a second on that one  Yeah I don't try to play tough  You tap out real quick  Yeah I'm trying to think  Of what a good move  I would go with  The punch to the face  Jimmy  No I don't want to do that  No you don't want  A real hard punch to the face  He's a hard puncher  Maybe one of the WEC guys  Oh there's the video  Of the arm bar  It really  Now how  Is this the way  A fighter should  Look at it  Can't even get it  On my wrist  Look at this  Within two seconds  You tapped  It's like  Yeah yeah yeah 
[01:51:30]  Kane's laughing  Kane's laughing at you  He barely put any pressure  On you  But you can pretty much  Get the description  If you just  You have a full  Barbecued chicken  And you twist the wing off  That's pretty much  What it would have done  To Jimmy  Well I didn't realize  That when  I was putting an arm bar  I didn't realize  It was pulling you  From both directions  Like it's obviously  Hurting your arm  But your chest  Is going the other way too  It's like  You're really fucked  What would you say  Wait wait wait  Here's now Randy  Giving him a little choke  This is just embarrassing  At this point  He's getting in the 
[01:52:00]  Crook of his arm  And Jimmy  I'm making sure Randy  Knows this is not for  All right  And it starts  Tap  And then Jimmy  Just goes wow  Here's how fast it goes  Start tap  Start tap  We're just thinking  Is there something  You can do to Jimmy  That's relatively safe  Okay  Yeah I can do  I don't like the fact  That he's so eager  Like before you finish  The question  He's like yeah  I can do a guillotine  Which he'll be right here  A guillotine  Jimmy  You're going to do a guillotine  Sure that sounds like  It's pleasant  Good  The guillotine 
[01:52:30]  All right  Guillotine  Now what exactly  Just for the people at home  What exactly is the guillotine  Is that when I'm standing up  And you're standing up  And you have my neck  And it's kind of like  He could lift me by my neck  Yeah yeah  Hence the name guillotine  Now how does one prevent you  From doing so  By  You would feel the tab  If I tap you  Yeah  All right  I think so  You'll be all right Jimmy  This continues the tradition  Of  I love it  UFC guys  Just beating up  Little Jimmy  Okay  Cain Velasquez  I get this a bunch of times 
[01:53:00]  I mean  If I got a shoot 10  You can catch it here  Or if I'm on the ground  I'm trying to get up somehow  You know  I'll push the head out to here  This is basically this  And I'm just lifting it  Now just so people know  Cain is standing  Facing me  I'm facing him  And my head is kind of down  Almost like I'm charging his armpit  Which would be a really stupid move  Yeah  To charge his armpit  And he just kind of grabs me  And then you pull up  Yeah  Let's try that just for a second  But I mean a second  Do you have a safe word Jimmy?  Yeah ouch  You won't be able to talk 
[01:53:30]  Okay  Alright  I'll tap  I'll tap  Believe me  You'll know  You'll know  You don't want to choke on your gum  Oh sure  I'll spit out the gum  Do you have any false limbs  You want to remove  Before I do this  Here we go  Okay  Jimmy looks nervous  Here it is  And  The sound he made  That's the worst  Because that  If you keep  If you do it really good  Like we do it in practice  That'll make you gag  And everything too 
[01:54:00]  Jimmy went  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  Wow  I understand why guys  Would want to shit  Vomit  And piss before  Because you don't want  To deal with that  During the  The noise you made  That's  That's the  That's like taking the arm bar  And the fucking  And the choke  And then multiplying them  By three  I didn't think you could get  Any more unpleasant than that  What did that feel like  Jimmy  Did you feel impending death  If that was any longer  All you think is  Please 
[01:54:30]  Please  Stop this  It's  There's nothing you're gonna do  Yeah  You aren't ever getting out of that  You're putting the pressure  What part of your hand  Are you putting the pressure with  Is it your  This is going right  It's right in the  The bone part of the wrist  Yeah  The bony part of the wrist  Right in your throat  Jimmy you don't know  You want me to do it again  Oh no  That was really  Very  Just want to make sure  Sam has good footage here  Let's hear the noise  Oh  I'm such a faggot  I just tap immediately 
[01:55:00]  You don't want to make that noise  Was that  Was that the worst of the three  Yeah it was  Really worse than Randy's  And BJ's  They were all unpleasant  Now how does a person  Get out of that  Once you're in it  You can't get out of it  No you can't  You gotta come in  Fight the wrist  The thing is  I put a lot of pressure right here  So it's coming off the air  I mean  It's not coming off the blood  It's coming off the air  It's hard to fight  When you can't breathe  Very uncomfortable  So you gotta really  You gotta get a little bit of  Space in between here  Turn that neck 
[01:55:30]  So you turn it this way  So there are guys  So you keep your windpipe  Away from that  If it's tight  I mean it's hard to get this down  So you can get  Yeah  So you can get that  But I mean if you're sweaty  And you know  Then it makes it a lot easier  A little more  You got balls  Jim Gaffigan is back  Jim do you want to come sit up here  You sit in the back there  I just  Yeah Jimmy  Yeah yeah  Jim he's got a seat over there  You know Jimmy's a great comedian here  You sit up there  I didn't mean to keep you in the back there  But Gaffigan was  I turned around and realized  He was laughing at me  Oh he was laughing hysterically  Because Jim you used to wrestle  Didn't you?  I you know  I wrestled in high school 
[01:56:00]  I mean watching this  It's like  It's pretty insane  Because there's like  Doing it  At least you guys watch it  I'm sitting back there going  I guess it's not on the Lifetime channel  No  I just  I have like three little kids  So it's like  I don't even  I love how  Norton was sort of setting you up  Going you wrestle  Meaning the next question would be  Why don't you guys  Play around a little bit  I'm mixing up a little bit  Not at all  But no Gaffigan's a strong dude  And it's like  To see  I don't know how anybody  Gets out of that situation  Yeah how does a guy  Get out of that 
[01:56:30]  That's trained  You just  Fight the wrist  I mean it's  Get separation  Yeah but you gotta fight  Past that initial feeling  You have to last longer than Jimmy did  How do you try to start getting out of it  You definitely gotta be in there  You know a while  To get comfortable in there  I mean it's  It's kind of off the air  So I mean you'll  You'll learn just to kind of  Fight through that  Wow  But he would be applying full pressure  Like that  He wasn't applying full pressure  That wasn't even full pressure  No  I didn't have the  I didn't have the chance to  Well  It was too quick  When you see 
[01:57:00]  In an actual fight  The strength that's being used  To pull up like that  You would think  The windpipe is gonna collapse  Or the neck's gonna break  It's just amazing  The amount of energy  And the lack thereof  That it took to  Make Jimmy make a gurgling noise  But I really made a non  That's not a fighter noise  No  No fighter does that  You sound like  A baby that dropped his nook  How about  We talk a lot about Fader  I'm surprised he didn't go to UFC 
[01:57:30]  But a part of me thinks  That he might have been  The more I see  The heavyweight division in UFC  A part of me thinks  That his people might have thought  He was gonna lose  To some of you guys  I don't know  I mean  For him  I've always looked up to him  I think he's always been  Definitely  I mean  The best heavyweight out there  As far as  You know  Just because  He's always mismatched  In his size  He goes out there  Fights guys  Who look a lot bigger than him  But he has so much power  He's  I mean  On the ground  He's so good  So I mean  I think he's definitely  One of the best  Always out there 
[01:58:00]  What was it that tapped  What the guy's name is  Wordum  Who tapped him  Yeah  Verdum  Tapped him out  With a triangle  Which is what  The guy  What Fader does  He knocks you down  Then he gets on top of you  And he really pounds you  But this guy seemed like  He almost set him up for that  And was like  Trying to get him  Now a triangle is exactly  What  He had that  That hole that's a triangle  It can be a choke  But then he also had the arm too  So he was cranking  On the arm also  It's when you're  You're on your back  And the guy's like  Leaning and say  He punches you  And then you  You triangle your legs 
[01:58:30]  Around his arm  And neck  So you're  You're cutting off his air  And twisting his arm  And he seemed like  He didn't want to tap  It could look like  You're getting your ass  Handed to you  And then in a split second  The other guy's going  I've had it  I've had it up  And you're like  Sometimes you look  And go  What just happened  I have no clue  What happened  And you check out  The replay  And go  Wow  That was a fast move  Legs wrap around  The arm goes  And you're  You're breaking  The guy's arm  Yeah yeah  I mean  It's definitely that quick  But uh  Yeah  I mean he  Verdum is  Is really great 
[01:59:00]  On the ground  And um  I mean he has  A long leg  So I mean  Standing over him  Throwing punches  I mean  It's  It's dangerous  You look like  A guy like  Cause Kane's  A really nice guy  But in the face  Really not  Does not fucking  Play games  You can see that  And we're talking  I'm looking him  In the eye  But I'm trying  To let him  Like friendly talk  Friendly talk  You don't want  A fucking fighter  To think you're  Making eye contact  I was on the elevator  With him  And I looked at him  And I was like  This man has killed people  This is someone  I'm not gonna be  I'm not gonna be  Very gentle with 
[01:59:30]  I'm like  Alright  I uh  But I don't have  Any questions  You know  I always  All my questions  Feel girly  I'm like  What color shorts  Do you wear  Well you gotta ask him  Ask him one question  We're not having  Manly questions  I just have to imagine  There has to be  Someone who punches you  Where you're just like  Christ I didn't know  That guy was that strong  And it's gotta like  Psychologically  You know  Kind of like  You have to  Recalibrate everything  Or is it just  Kind of like  You're in the zone  And you're just going  I think that depends  On the person  I mean there's guys  That will get hit 
[02:00:00]  And pretty much  Crumble under the pressure  And there's guys  That will get hit  And I mean  It won't faze them  You know  I definitely feel like  I'm one of those guys  In training  And stuff like that  I mean you get hit  I mean it's just  It's like okay  Now I'm gonna give you yours  You know  That's the type of thing  Yeah cause you would think  You'd get hit  And go like  Oh no  I gotta fight this guy  Like for the  How long is this  Yeah  Is it one of those things  Like if you lose  Your temper in there  You're lost  Or does your temper 
[02:00:30]  Kind of inspire you  And then you like  Are going on adrenaline  And just tearing the guy apart  I think  If you have a game plan  Yeah  You have to fight  As far as being  A calculating fight  You can't fight  As far as being  An emotional fighter  You know  You gotta have  A good balance  Between the two  If you're just  Going out there  Throwing wild punches  That's not good  I mean  It's just like in boxing  And he goes  A guy's really wild  Sloppy with his technique  He's pretty much  Gonna get beat  He's gonna get knocked out  I think a lot of people  Have a problem 
[02:01:00]  Making the difference  Between that  Like you said  Yeah a boxer  You've seen boxing  Where the guy comes out  And he's just sloppy  And you go  Wow this guy  Is gonna get his ass  Handed to him  But I don't think  A lot of people  Get the finesse  Of mixed martial arts  Where that does happen  Where  Cause it's hard to tell  If someone's being sloppy  Be quite honest  Cause there's a lot  Of rolling around  Going on  A lot of just  Punching wherever you can  And kicking  Unless you really  Know the sport  And you know 
[02:01:30]  Are really in it  All the time  And know all the  Technical stuff of it  You can find  You know  Little stuff here  And there  Of that  Let's not forget  We got an MMA expert  In studio  Mars just loves the sport  He's an expert at it  And he usually comes up  With the best question  When you guys  Come in here  To hang out with us  He comes in black and blue  Mars has been preparing  All day  All day for this  He's a little nervous  But look  He's even wearing  A UFC shirt  As you can see  Mars you're  A respect for Kane  I would hope 
[02:02:00]  Yes Kane  Congratulations by the way  I wasn't prepared  To ask you any questions  He's just being  You know  Oh yeah  He was prepared  On the spot  I will ask you  When you get to fight  Dos Santos  You say his boxing skills  Are better than yours  But your boxing skills  Are pretty up to par  Oh thanks  Up to par  He's the UFC champion  So I guess  All right  Thanks  Up to par compared to  Dos Santos  You cut the mustard  Alright that's nice  That's something to say 
[02:02:30]  To the UFC champion  He's the champ  He'll be Brock Lesnar  Your boxing doesn't suck  Up to par there Kane  There's something  I'll take home with you  Kane feel free to just  Punch him  So you think that  I'm sure that you're  Going to stand up  With him for a little bit  But he's also  Very hard to take down  And you're going to  Go ahead and  You're going to  Try your best  To take him down  How's his skills  No need for Kane's answer  That's why I love Mars  He asks a question  And then goes right on  Mars is getting so nervous 
[02:03:00]  He's actually peeing  Crapping  And he's going to  Puke in a second  Right  Hold on  He's looking down  And he's fidgeting  With his hands  And the wires  Yes Mars has  Mars has credited  Your moderate boxing skills  And somewhere in here  Will be a question  By the way  He's reacting like this  Because he knew  You guys were going to do it  He's like  Here it comes  How's Dos Santos  Ground game  Compared to yours  Primits haven't seen  His ground game  But yeah definitely  I mean I think  He is the best  Heavyweight boxer 
[02:03:30]  That there is  In the UFC  But for us  We've got to  Utilize everything  That we know  As far as boxing  Kickboxing  We can throw a lot  Of kicks  Punches  Mix it in  With the wrestling  Too  If the takedowns  Are there  Definitely take it  But nothing forced  If you try to force  A takedown  On somebody like that  You pretty much  Going into some trouble  But we haven't seen  His ground game yet  So yeah  I mean  But we definitely  Plan doing everything  With them  Mexico is a huge  Market now too  I think  Didn't they just  Open it up  Didn't you put it

[02:08:00]  While you're in the bathroom  And try to you know  Work his magic  And then he comes back  Yeah  Work some robbery  Now a situation like that  You want a robbery  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  You come back  A guy's talking to your chick  Not  Just talking to her  What do you  Do you say anything  Or do you just kind of  Stand there  And let it be known  That that's probably  Not a smart move  No  Yeah  I'll be nice  I come up you know  And just say  Hey what's up  What's going on  Like you know  Pat him on the back  Or something like that  And if he doesn't get it  And if he doesn't get it  Then he's like  Get out of here  Faints  Has it happened  Has it happened 
[02:08:30]  No I can't think of  Any situation  It happened  See you're our worst  Nightmare as comedians  Too  Because you get heckled  You never know  Who's truly yelling out  And you hit them hard  Verbally  And it happened to you  With what's his name  Didn't Dana White bring  Oh yeah  Liddell  Liddell  And Liddell was sort of  Heckling  Jimmy didn't know it  Right  I didn't know it was Chuck  But I know Chuck  And I know Dana  So it was like  You knew it was cool in the end  But at first you didn't know  Who was heckling  Yeah I hear a noise 
[02:09:00]  I'm like  It's fucking Liddell  Like what do you do  First of all  No one's going to throw him out  That guy's heckling  Really  Fuck you  Let him ruin your dumb show  All of a sudden  It becomes the Chuck Liddell show  Yeah  What do you do with that  There's nothing you can do  It wasn't a nasty heckle  He was just you know  Fucking around  Just being playful  Because he's Chuck  How does that work  Does that get you off your game  When you're out there  It depends  Sometimes  Yes sometimes  No other times  You like it  Sometimes it's fun  To just attack people  Well Mars said  Your mediocre crowd work  Really doesn't 
[02:09:30]  Doesn't quite get over  You know  It's like  You know  It's like sometimes  When people think  They're doing it to help you  Like the guy up front  Who's like  Just keeps talking  And yelling  Because he thinks  He's helping you  You really want to  Pull out a pistol  And just fucking shoot him  Or hit him  If I was a man  But it can throw you off  If they're stepping on your punchlines  Like you know  You get into a joke  Yeah yeah  It's just  It's distracting  And you know  You don't mind  If they want some interaction  But if they're just drunk  And they're just kind of blathering 
[02:10:00]  You can't even slam them  Because they're so out of their mind  They don't know what's going on  I cringe  I cringe at moments  When a comic  They have  On purpose  They put a little gap  In their monologue  During a joke  And I sit there  Every time  Just thinking  Please  No one's saying anything  Really  Yeah  Because I just know  Some idiot  Can yell something out  And it's a dramatic pause  Or something  Whatever you want to do  But then someone's just like  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah  Oh great 
[02:10:30]  One of my favorite heckles  And I've told Mitch  Our buddy Mitch Fattel  To stand up  And he's kind of like a character  Where he's kind of like  Meek and cute on stage  And he always walks on stage  And he goes  Hi my name is Mitch  I'm very funny  And the crowd digs him  The best heckle I've ever seen  Was some drunk at the cellar  Mitch walked on  And he goes  Hi I'm Mitch  And I'm very funny  And the guy goes  You better be  You fucking faggot  Oh my god  And I told Mitch that  Years later  And he goes  You were there  That was the worst thing  Anybody's ever said to me  Dude I fucking  My heels clicked  To see your friend get  Just so berat 
[02:11:00]  How did he handle it  How did he handle it  He was like  I don't  He handled it  Did he get out of it  Yeah  But it threw him  Because no one's ever been  That mean to Mitch  Just flat out  Unnecessarily  Completely unnecessary  Kane has to go  Oh yeah  He has to go  He brought the championship belt in  I know  Yeah  I would like to see  A velvety case  Or leather  What is that  Yeah  Kind of sweet  I don't know what this is  Oh  Wow  It's the jewels from the belt  Oh my gosh  Now you sit there and you go  I can't wear brown belts  Brown boots with this 
[02:11:30]  Because it's black  This is so heavy  Doesn't fit through my loops  On my pants  I couldn't wear this  That's so cool  Just for a photo shoot  I would collapse on my knees  Yes  Wow that is something  Do you get to keep it  Or is it like the Stanley Cup  Yeah no  Every time we fight  We fight for a new belt  Oh okay  So that you get to keep  Yeah this is mine  That's awesome man  That is fantastic  Right on  Thank you  Congratulations Cain  Yeah  Cain Alaskaz  Great guy  And a great fighter  Thank you  Wait are you promoting something  Hold on let me just say  Because Cain was promoting 
[02:12:00]  You want to promote  What is it  UFC 122  UFC 122  The main event  Nate Marquardt  Versus Yushin Okami  The co-main  George Rivera  Which is from New York  And Alessio Saccaro  And it's being shown on  When exactly is that  I know we have it  I think it's  I don't know  That's Jim  I don't know  This Saturday  Saturday  This Saturday  What time  Spike TV  9pm Eastern  And it's being shown for free  6 hour tape delay  So you might want to turn off  You might want to turn off 
[02:12:30]  Your Twitter  Turn off Twitter  By the way  Cain MMA on Twitter  C-A-I-N-M-M-A  C-A-I-N-M-M-A  Right  Right  Okay  Thanks  We'll be back with Jimmy  You need to stay for a little while  Alright  Okay cool  We got Gaffigan  We did the plugs  Mr. Jim Byrne  You're done  Okay  Look at you and your mustache  You creep  Alright we'll be back in a minute  Yeah  The Obi and Anthony show  On the virus  Series XM  I must admit  I can't explain  Any of these thoughts 
[02:13:00]  Racing through my brain  It's true  Baby I'm howling for you  Want to say hi to Jim Gaffigan  Officially  It's an honor to be here 
[02:13:30]  Yeah he was in during our  With our interview with Cain Velasquez  Cain and I very similar  Yes  Physical appearance  Yeah  He was a very very nice guy  Yeah  And he's made to fight  Like you were saying  Yeah  Like we're not made to fight  One punch him  Not only is the fight done  I think our lives are done  Yeah  I mean he has the appearance  Of like  You know  A character from the video game  Yeah  Yeah yeah  He's like the boss  The last guy that you gotta get through  In the video game 
[02:14:00]  To win the whole game  That's him  How cool was Cain there Jimmy  Great guy man  Yeah I was telling Jimmy off Mike  I bow to him  To get into some of these holds  With these guys  I don't know how you do that  Even though it's for a half a second  But that half a second  Is brutal  Because I really am curious  As to what it feels like  To be in this  Because I watch it a lot  And guys on that level  Make it look like  It's not that bad  Because there are plenty of guys  That could get out of  What Randy Couture put me in  Or what Cain just put me in  Or at least make a go of it 
[02:14:30]  But it's like  On my level of fighting  Which is zero  It's interesting to see  How badly a guy  Could fuck you up  If he wanted to  Wouldn't it be amazing  To see how long  You would last  After the bell rang  No  In the cage  Like just  No interest  Like I actually  Suggested doing it  It's like  Oh god  I'd rather try to ride  I don't even want the universe  To accidentally hear that  And like a chain of events  Lead up to it  So you requested it 
[02:15:00]  No I didn't  It would be as long  As it took  For the guy to get to Jimmy  I'd rather  I think I'd rather ride a bull  Yes  I would try to stay in a bull  Before I would go in a cage  With all these guys  Absolutely  Fuck that  Well there's also  Like a showmanship  Like where  You know  If they're in it  I can't speak for that guy  Obviously  But  Like Mars could  It's  But it's not like  They can say  You know  Yeah that one guy  Is kind of terrifying  They have to like  Keep the exterior  Right 
[02:15:30]  You know what I mean  And even when they get like  Some crazy choke hold  They can't sit there  And have like  A human spaz moment  Like Jesus  Why'd you do that  You know what I mean  Yeah they gotta  Deal with it  That's insane  You can't break down  And cry in the middle of the cage  But you know  Comedians  We're kind of like  UFC fighters  Really  Aren't we Jim  We're kind of  Yeah  Except for we're  More of  They're like the knights  And we're like  The court jesters  UFC  We're unbelievably  Fruity cocksuckers  Compared to that world  But then again  What we do 
[02:16:00]  Scares them  On a certain level too  Because no UFC fighter  Wants to get on stage  And you just stand there  And tell Joe  They would just beat people up  That's what we tell ourselves  There is something  Like when people  That's like the hardest thing  In the world  And I'm like  Sitting next to this  You know  To Kane  And I'm like  No  There's something much harder  Yeah I always love that thing  That everybody says  It's like  And the number one fear  For everybody  Is speaking in public  Shut the fuck up  How about having a knife  To your throat  With Al-Qaeda behind you  Yeah jumping in a foxhole  With two guys 
[02:16:30]  Yeah that could probably  Be a little scarier  Than hey ladies and gentlemen  How we doing this evening  Yeah  Speaking after a dinner party  Right  Yeah  Go giving a toast  I think I'm a fan of Kane's now  I think a lot of us  Wanted Brock to win the fight  For whatever reason  We were more familiar with him  We're more familiar  Because we don't know  The sport as well as others  I would say  And you just want that whole myth  To keep going  Like I wanted to see him  Just chug along  Like an early Mike Tyson thing  Where it's like  Oh he's fighting again  Let's watch someone  Get their ass handed to him 
[02:17:00]  Yeah no one can beat him  I want to see him  Wrestle a moose  A moose?  I want Brock Lesnar  To wrestle a moose  I think we  I want Dana  To set that up  I think you're projecting  A little bit there  I'd like to see him  With a moose  When you look at Kane's  Me and Marge  Are talking about this  In the hallway  When you look at Kane's brow  Oh yeah  Like it really is  Like almost a fucking  Cro-Magnon brow  It is that  It's like a caveman  Kind of a thing  Which I would never say 
[02:17:30]  If he was still sitting here  But that's not even an insult  He would probably acknowledge that  It's like there's a certain  He has the face of a fighter  And the head of a fighter  Like you're not knocking him out  With an average punch  Is it true  A lot of these guys  Don't really lift a lot of weights  I don't know  Because he wasn't defined  As like a weight lifter  You know what I mean  His body  But obviously  He could just kill you  I'm guessing they power lift  But I could be completely wrong  It would be interesting to ask  I didn't think to ask  Yeah  I think they have to work out  A little bit  It's kind of like  You know  Saying like people  That go to Harvard  Didn't do their homework  You know what I mean 
[02:18:00]  It's like  Yeah they never  Never cracked a book  Nope  Nope  Good point  That would be  Just past every test  Do you lift weights  That would have been a funny question  So do you work out  So do you work out  What do you do  Like the elliptical  What do you bench  He does spinning clacks  Can you imagine  A bunch of chicks  Are you like Pilates  What kind of Pilates do you do  Do you do the heat yoga  I heard that Liddell  What Chuck Liddell does  When he trains  He does like wheelbarrows  Full of rocks  Up steadily  They do these 
[02:18:30]  But that's what I mean  Yeah  I know it  Clover Lang workout  Yeah  I know they work out  I'm just saying  I don't think  Traditionally they're lifting weights  Like us dummies  I don't know what they do  To get the strength  I'm going to guess  More power lifting for strength  But again  Somebody out there might know  I have no idea  Yeah I mean they train  They practice  Fighting other people  Yeah  So it's like  You know  Alright how many people  Do I have to kick the crap  Out of today  Yeah that's true  Like their practicing  Is really fighting  Other people too  Things that would be  A horrific 
[02:19:00]  Moment in your life  And in my life  That's what they do  To train  That's what they do  On a Tuesday  I would just be like  Ah I'm getting punched  Ow  Well did you hear  What he said  He goes  I've never been knocked out  Even in practice  So that obviously  These guys are getting  Knocked out  Just practicing  For the big fight  That probably doesn't  Know what it's like  To lay there  And then open your eyes  And go oh I've been hit  Oh I get it  It's a very  He's a very powerful guy  Man and a very  Very fast puncher  I like them too  He's a very nice dude  Cool guy  None of those guys  They all  All our cool guys 
[02:19:30]  Are amazingly laid back  And yeah calm  And just  Hey now he's gonna be  Over there  Look he's over  He's just here  And now he's on TV  Hey the guy  That's the same guy  That was just sitting there  Oh he's on Fox  I want to see  See he's actually  Got such speed  And he kicks  It's like these guys  Just do everything  Now we're just gonna watch  One of us  One of us has gotta  Take a kick to the thigh  By the  No  God  From the next fighter  That comes in here  Why not  They could probably  Break your femur  They could break your leg  You just snap your femur 
[02:20:00]  With a little kick  I take slow  Pressure build things  That I can tap  You never  You wanna say  I throw a puncher  No  You don't want impact  You want slow  You want torque  No  You don't want  Any type of a  I do bow to Jimmy  Because I did get  Choked out once  Up there in Boston  By Steve Richards  Or Stevie Richards  From the WWF  Because I was  I was the asshole  Who laughed at you  Triple H  Did he go  Everybody laughed at me  Everybody laughed at me 
[02:20:30]  You know I'm an asshole  And I took it a little too far  With the wrestling guy  Saying I wrestle  I was one of those idiots  So in Boston  We were at a gig  And backstage  Wasn't even in front of people  He fucking got pissed  And lifted me up  In a choke hold  And it was the most horrifying  Second  Two seconds of my life  Looks like Andrew WK  Yeah  I learned my lesson  I fucking learned my lesson  Yeah  My throat hurt for weeks  To this day  I think he like  Did something  Permanent damage  I don't know 
[02:21:00]  Maybe a little fucking  I'll sue you  I trust these guys  More than  A wrestler  Yeah because they're choking you  For like  Wrestlers can choke you  Didn't Belzer get choked out  By  Who was it  It was Hogan  Hogan  He sued him too right  Yeah  Hogan  He said something  Like alright  We'll put me in a headlock  Hogan and Mr. T were on  Yeah  Yeah and Hogan said okay  And he put him right to sleep  Put him in a sleeper hole  And just dropped him to the floor  Right on TV  Cracked his head open  Where he needed stitches  And he woke up  And just said  We'll be right back  After these messages  The other one was 
[02:21:30]  Who was it  John Stossel  John Stossel and Dr. D  Dr. D  David Schultz yeah  We see Dr. D  He's like  Well isn't this all fake  Isn't this all phony  And Dr. D said  Is this fake  I'll show your face  And he slapped him  Right in the ear  And just  Ow  Just open him  You know that must have  Just went  Forever  He's still here  There's gotta be a constant  Threat of lawsuits  I would think  You would think  You know it's like  You know like you're in a bodega  With this guy  Yeah yeah  There's gotta be scumbags  That are like  Yeah he bumped into me  In the bodega 
[02:22:00]  And now I can't walk  Yeah  Yeah the constant threat  Just looming  That you're gonna be sued  Sure  For anything  That's why I was saying to him  Like what do you  You gotta know  You can literally kill someone  With your hands  By the way  Jason Ellis  Definitely  He had Fedor kick him  When  Oh yeah on his show  Recently  I forgot about that  Yeah but he does that  Was it recently  Or a while ago  Hold on man  Let's go to Derek in Iowa  And if he had any balls  He would let Fedor punch him  Derek  He does ultimate fighting 
[02:22:30]  Yeah but still  It's Fedor  And he's getting kicked  In the thigh  I should have asked Fedor  To put me in a move  How bad was the kick Derek  When Jason Ellis  Took it from Fedor  He's actually got it on YouTube  You should check it out  It's pretty brutal  He gets there  And he braces for  And Fedor just drills him  With a kick  And he just falls  Directly on the floor  Yeah and then  Pretty bad  And then there were pictures  Of how purple his leg got man  Yeah it was pretty bad  Pretty bad  Oh my god  I mean that  We were just watching  The Richard Belzer  Hulk Hogan  Why would he let him  Fall on the floor 
[02:23:00]  Why would he let him  This is the difference  Now Hulk is putting  Belzer in pretty much  The same thing  A guillotine  This is exactly  What Jimmy just took  What Jimmy just took  But now  Belzer you could tell  Wants out  And Hulk is having  No part of it  The other reason  That you can't  Like have wrestlers  Put you in moves  Is because people  Don't take wrestlers  Seriously  They think they're wimps  Because it's not  Competitive fighting  So they have something  To prove  Like nobody thinks  That a UFC  Like Jim didn't say  Put me in a chokehold  You're not actually  Choking anybody  So when you tell that 
[02:23:30]  So when you tell that  To a pro wrestler  They're like okay  They're interested  In protecting the business  There's no tapping out  With these guys  There's some anger  Involved with it  Like when Eastside Dave  Wrestled this guy  Danny Doering  At the Hard Rock Cafe  Eastside Dave  Always tells a story  He said  The one thing  He told me to do  Is when you're  Giving somebody  A clothesline  Always in the chest  Never the throat  Because you know  You can hurt your throat  And Eastside Dave  Said the minute  The bell rings  Danny Doering  Whines back  And clothesline  Right to the  Adam's apple  Just to let him know 
[02:24:00]  You can't just  Step into a  Yeah yeah  You're not a professional  I'm going to prove it  Unbelievable  Yeah I want to see that  I want to see that  And when was that  Fedor kick  Was that recently  Or a while ago  You lose track of time  When you sit here  Day in and day out  I wasn't doing that  Back then  But I should have  Got Fedor to put me  It was 25  Years ago  It could have been  Last week  Was it 25 years ago  This is like prison  It was either last week  Or three years ago  I don't know  Here it is 
[02:24:30]  Watch this  I haven't seen this  In a while  A little bit  You know what I mean  This should have  More than 4,000 views  Yeah  The affliction pod  And  I'm the beard guy  I'm moving around  You're like  Come on  A little peek here  Yeah there you go  Right there  Watch this  Oh  Oh yeah  Wow  Oh  Wow  One more  You don't say  One more to Fedor  No  One more 
[02:25:00]  One more  No  One more  That is crazy  Get the fuck out of here  Oh my god  Oh he's trying  No no no  He doesn't  You want Fedor to hurt you  God damn it  That hurts  Just a little  Yeah  Yeah  Jason  That's  Fantastic  The charlie horse  You'd get from that  Let's see  Let's see  Oh  He does his own stunts  Wow  Wow Fedor just  It's an effortless kick 
[02:25:30]  To his left thigh  An effortless kick  You know Fedor  Probably held back  A little bit  But it was still  A lot  He held back a lot  Okay  But that was still  Ridiculously  He barely twisted his body  Impressive  It was all just leg  Wow  Yeah dude  He's not trying to hurt him  Would you do that Jimmy  No  No impact  I don't know  It all depended  Jason looks like a fighter  So he probably got it harder  Than I would get it  I would ask him  I would let Fedor do that  But not  As long as he understood  That I was just  I just wanted to see  What it was like  To feel the impact  And I didn't want a full kick 
[02:26:00]  Yeah  I would make sure  That translation  Was very very clear  You know  You gotta let these guys  Know why you're not  Why you're not doing it  David Schultz  That's right  Is he still alive  Yes  I remember seeing this one  He ain't in it  He's red next out here  I ain't in it  Because it's a tough business  Oh shit  That's terrific  Wait is that all you got  I'll ask you the standard question  You know  Standard question  I think this is fake  You think it's fake  What's that  Is that fake  Holy shit  He put him right on the ground 
[02:26:30]  You think it's fake  Oh shit  Jesus  He's bitch slapping  John Stossel  You gotta protect the business  And John Stossel  Just ran away  He ran away  You think it's fake  You think it's fake  Exactly  Bam  He gave him one on one side  And then one on the other  Did he get sued for that  He had to have  Oh come on  He lost a lot of money  Oh really Stossel sues after that  When he  Fuck Stossel  I know  I'm on Stossel's side  He didn't ask the guy to hit him  Yeah but he was being cocky 
[02:27:00]  Going to see  Yeah he was being  And then this is the Belzer one  Belzer falls like a sack of potatoes  Dude  He really goes down  Look at the size difference  What year was this  This was Wrestlemania in 1985  84  25 years ago  He's out  Just the way he dropped  He's alright  He's just sleeping  He's sleeping  Really 
[02:27:30]  I was asleep a hole  He'd be alright  He's waking up now  That was a serious  A lot of people  I bet most people thought  Belzer was faking it  Look at that pool of blood  On the ground  Yeah yeah  He cracked his  We'll be right back  After this word  From you know who  Look at the blood  On the back of his head  He cracked his head open  Hey Belzer sued  Yeah  That was a terrible  Yeah  Cause I mean he hurt his head  Oh Belzer sued the shit  Out of Hulk on that one  It was a terrible thing  To drop him like that  Let me see  What's Belzer say here  Did you see his head  Flat forward and back 
[02:28:00]  He was like  Even before he hit the ground  You're like  This is wrong  He looks dead  I said  When I got up  And said  We'll be right back  I had no idea  Where I was  I was in shock  And just  I know I'm bringing  Doing this a little bit  Maybe going too far  But can we get a close up  Of these stitches  Cause I saw Bill Cosby today  And he thought it was a hoax  And if he thought  Can we read that  There was a hoax  Can you see that  Can you see those stitches  No we can't  No I'm sorry  I'm sorry  But I just wanted to  To show you 
[02:28:30]  And this is not  The first incident  Between a professional wrestler  And a television interview  Watch what happened  To ABC's 2020 report  They actually said  He's gearing up  For the  Gearing up for his lawsuit  Yeah watch what happened  Let's see there's precedent here  I'm  I'm not going to sue  A UFC guy  No  I didn't ask Fedor  To do anything  But see Fedor  Is just trying to be light  And he's not looking  Plus you don't want  Lost in translation  He didn't speak English  Jim Gaffigan  Yeah  Guy sat here 
[02:29:00]  With a translator  Fedor I would ask  For a  How would you  Make sure they were  Translating that properly  Would you please  Kill me  He wants to be hit  Really hard  I would try a triangle  With Fedor  I wanted to ask Kane  For that  But I've got to  Save that for another  Fighter  The triangle  I would like to be  Putting that  It's where  The guy's on his back  And again  He triangles around  Your neck and your arm  Are kind of through  And your arm is just  Helpless  Yeah yeah  You want to do that  My arm would be  Helpless  Yeah you want to do that  I do want to try that  Why  You want to try that  Five million 
[02:29:30]  Five million for that  Five million  1985  Five million  Five million  1985 dollars  From Hulk  Or from wrestling  I think it was Hulk  He also sued Mr. T  Why  Because Mr. T  Egged him on  Yeah why don't you  Keep him like that  For a while  Keep him like that  I bet he didn't get  Anything from Mr. T  He just sleeping  He just sleeping  Did he get anything  From Mr. T  I don't know  Let's find out  This guy seems to know  One gold chain  Jeremy in Indiana  Jeremy  Hey buddy 
[02:30:00]  He sued Hulk  I know he got  Five million off of Hulk  It went on  For a little bit  In court  In that  It never really says  What he got  From Mr. T  But some people  Are saying like  1.2 million  From Mr. T  And then some  Are saying like  600,000  Why did he get  Anything from Mr. T  Well Mr. T  Egged him on  Well they said  A lot of it  Was off camera  Oh  Him and Mr. T  Kind of had words  And Mr. T  Allegedly pushed him  While he was still bleeding  And it was some of  Mr. T's 
[02:30:30]  Deodorant commercials  Mr. T  Then exclaimed  The court report  Is like  I have no idea  How to spell that  You find another one  Sam  Your witness  He then pitied  The fool  Is it not true  When you pitied  The fool  You were actually  Not pitying  The fool  I pity the fool  Say I'm lying  But I pity the fool  This host doesn't

Yep  And it's like  Oh they're soft  Yeah  They're pliable  But if you took that thing  By the legs  And whapped someone  Across the head with it  Yeah  It was like  Some kind of  Illegal weapon  That the police 
[02:35:30]  Used to have  Back in the 30's  It just would  Knock somebody out  Yeah  Yeah it's soft  Don't worry about it  Stretch Armstrong  We should take a break  Just cut him open  And see what was inside  What was it?  A little wiring  Or something right?  No it was like  Some kind of  Starchy gooey stuff  Yeah  Which one is this?  Vince McMahon?  It's when he was on  HBO  And he decided  To become Mr. McMahon  And he slapped  The guy's papers  Wally  What?  He slapped the papers  Out of his hands  Blast the papers 
[02:36:00]  Like sometimes  Vince does interviews  And just becomes  The TV character  TV Vince  In the middle of an interview  With a CEO  Of a company  He's a billionaire  I can't remember this  I haven't seen this  In years  Let's hear this  As far as  And you've got that  Little look on your face  Like jeez  Vince  How can you possibly  Say that?  Well but none whatsoever  I mean they wrestled for you  They were part of your organization  They worked a couple  Of hundred nights a year  For you  They lived this lifestyle  Oh my god 
[02:36:30]  You can't believe  Can you see that look?  I mean  Oh how can you possibly  Say that Vince?  How can you look that way  And you're giving me  The old sympathetic stuff?  No I'm not  I'm honestly curious  Because I told you  Wow  What was that about?  Wrestling deaths  He didn't feel like  Talking about it that day  And how long ago  Is that interview?  That's a while ago now  This was probably  Like very early 2000s  Maybe late 90s  Like 99  You can do a recap now  On the whole thing  Yeah they have 
[02:37:00]  They have to do two hours  Instead of one  How many days are we up to?  We're doing good right?  We are doing pretty good  We have this little thing  We do with Jim Gaffigan  We just want to go  A hundred days  Without a wrestler dying  Yeah  A hundred days  And we haven't been able to  Is there a Google alert for that?  How many days are we up to this?  Sam's seen when the last wrestler died  They usually die at the ripe old age 
[02:37:30]  Of mid-40s  Yes  From you know  Diseases that a lot of people get  At a young age  You know  Heart disease  Brain hemorrhages  So is it  Do you assume that it's like steroids?  What?  We wouldn't say that  Oh Jim Gaffigan  Jim Gaffigan  They would never do steroids  It's just a coincidence  We're not saying anything Jim  People have fatal heart attacks  In their early 40s  All the time  Of course  Of course 
[02:38:00]  Yes  Wow  So how long are we  I mean it's been over a month  I would say  Wow  We're doing okay  Wow  We might make it to 100  Maybe there's a lot more wrestlers  That's it  You know  Maybe that is  Yeah  I mean that occupation has grown a lot  It certainly  You know  And  Hey Michu Kaku's on  Can we get him on the phone  And talk about that missile  You saw that missile in California Jim  I believe it was a  It's like contributing nothing  It's a  An anomaly  Thank you

[02:47:30]  Are we allowed to make cheeseburgers  There was a time  We weren't allowed to cook our pop tarts here  Right  There was a fire hazard  Security  Well getting into this building  It's ridiculous right  Yeah  What's going on here  Go through this  Is there some kind of secrets going on  Do you have anything in your bag  It's like  I'm going to Sirius  Right  Well  We don't want you to attack the Cosmo channel  Maybe these guys are working for the CIA  And make them believe they're doing radio or something 
[02:48:00]  There's secretive shit going on back there  It's creepy  Something's going on  Dun dun  Yeah  Dun dun  Dun dun  My eyes are burning today  I'm tired  Of course  Call of Duty  Black Ops came out yesterday  We had the wonderful intern  Little Stevie  Pick mine up  And I only wish now that he hadn't  I am going to  And I really am  Record myself playing this game  Because I am a stark raving lunatic 
[02:48:30]  I realize  And I can't help it  Like I can't stop doing it  At one point I even said  Out loud  I'm alone in my house  And out loud I just said  What are you doing  It's a game  It's a game  Why are you losing your mind  Because I can't play  I'm horrible at this game  And I want to be good at it  No  Did you put like six hours in  Probably  Probably yeah  And so like you  I mean I totally have  The addictive thing  So it's like  I get it  Because you get into it 
[02:49:00]  And you're like  Alright I just want to get to this level  I just got to get to that level  Alright I got to be able to kill that guy  And then  Yeah yeah next level  I figure that  I just want to get this attachment  For my gun  And then you're like  Video game time  Is the fastest time in the world  Yeah  Because you'll look at  I'll look at my watch  And it's like  Oh it's like five in the afternoon  I got plenty of time  Oh wow it's eleven thirty at night  And so do you secretly think  Hey you know  This will be nice bragging rights  When I go over to someone's house  Oh you've got Call of Duty  Let me just try  Let me try  Yeah yeah  So you'll be like 
[02:49:30]  Make believe  People are wildly impressed  That guy is amazing  At the new Call of Duty  I just want to be able to  Play the game  And not be  The worst person playing it  Right  I am the worst  I play a multiplayer  So  Every time the stats come on  After the game  On how many kills  How many deaths you had  I am always at the bottom of the list  And I'm talking  Two kills  Thirty deaths  And how do they know 
[02:50:00]  How to play it so well  It just came out yesterday  I know  But well  It's similar to the other  Call of Duty  No I know it's similar  But still  There's the same  There is a learning curve  When a new game comes out  Isn't there  Pretty similar  Okay  You know what it is  While they're getting good at it  You're fucking girls  I know  It all comes out in the wash  But  You're doing your job  Yeah  They're at the bottom of the list  When it comes to fucking girls  I just want to be able to  To get  And I don't understand  And this is what I yell about  To myself  In my house 
[02:50:30]  Playing the game  Out loud  I don't understand  How people  Can walk around  The same map  I'm walking around  With the same weaponry  Walking  Turning  Looking  I'm not  I'm not just  And their stats  Twenty kills  Zero deaths  I do not get it  Here's how you balance it out  For every kill they have  You have a load  On a girl  Who's under 25  Believe me  You're winning  The wash in the air  I'm so paranoid 
[02:51:00]  Do you think  That they actually  Manipulate the situation  So that people  Have to put the time in  So that  You know  Everyone will get up  Higher  So that  Because you  Right now  Your self esteem is damaged  So you want to accomplish it  Right  Here was me  Here's a little  A little taste of me  Like this is exactly  What I was doing  Could you turn around  Before you do the impression  It might sound  A little like this  He does these impersonations  I swear  You would think  It was the real people 
[02:51:30]  I have my controller  In my hand  I'm going along  And I'm  Now I see a guy  He's in front of me  And he's coming toward me  And he doesn't quite see me yet  So I start unloading on him  I hit him  Maybe  Five  Six times  He fires one shot  And kills me  I'm like  This is fucking bullshit  I hit you  I hit you  Ah 
[02:52:00]  Fucking game  I suck  I'm the worst  I shouldn't even have  Gotten it  Oh  Oh good  The knife  Oh good  Yeah yeah  Just slipped my throat  In silence  That's a ballsy way  To kill someone  Yeah you could kill  Someone like that  I have this real gun  And I can't use it  In a game  I've shot this  At a range  And hit bullseyes  Fuck this guy  Oh this one again  This one again  Kills me  Oh a grenade  Out of nowhere  That's good 
[02:52:30]  When I throw my grenades  What do they hit  Nothing  Nothing  That's me  You gotta tape yourself  For hours on end  And is it true  You got the same games  In real  The same guns  In real life  Yeah most of them  Except for the full automatic  Heavy machine guns  That's gotta be so frustrating  I have every single  Yeah gun  I was using the MP5  Last night  And stuff  And I have this  Civilian version  The semi-automatic version  Right  But I mean  I can go to the range  And get a grouping  The size of a quarter  With this thing  It's a fantastic gun 
[02:53:00]  On this game  I'm like  Gah  Not hitting anyone  They run up  As I'm firing at them  With a machine gun  And he stabs me  With a knife  Like wait a minute  I have a machine gun  That's a fight  Like  Gaining all this knowledge  Of all these guns you have  It's like  Now I'm looking at you  Like I looked at the UFC guy  Where I'm like  Alright  Okay  An enormous amount of respect  Paid to you  That guy 
[02:53:30]  Deferential to you  In any argument  I go crazy  He owns a few guns Jim  I own a couple  Is it one of  So you eventually  With most video games  You know  There's like a peak  Where you master it  Right  And then you're bored with it  Then you're like  This is easy  Yeah but  Out of all the Call of Duties  That have been out  And they've been out  For years now  Years  And I've been playing them  For years  And the basic interface  And weaponry  And shooting  Hasn't changed  It's the same targeting  The same everything  I cannot work 
[02:54:00]  A gaming console controller  With the little joystick-y thing  And the little trigger buttons  You give me a mouse and keyboard  On a computer game  And I'm golden  But no one plays on that anymore  So I'd be sitting there  With ten people  Trying to go  Hey is there anybody  Playing the game  You go on a console  There's thousands of people  Playing at any given moment  How do you play on a keyboard  Arrow left  Move right  You use the  W-S-A-D  Kind of  Shift  Shift L 
[02:54:30]  Is actually  That's a grenade  You move around  With your mouse  Backspace  That's kind of like  Tripping someone  I just don't get it  It's so much more exacting  To move a mouse  Into a target  Onto a target  Than it is  A game controller  What do you say  If it wasn't as easy  You'd have a game controller  Running your computer  Oh you're running over  The magic flower  Enter  And get a steel hat  That's EverQuest  Jimmy's not a fan  Of video games  It's also silly 
[02:55:00]  How many hours  Did you spend  Playing that  Okay let's see  I got home yesterday  And I had the game  I ate  So I was playing the game  By probably  One in the afternoon  So from one in the afternoon  Till probably  Eleven o'clock last night  See that's why  I don't have any video games  I just  I don't trust myself  That's just  Yeah yeah  Is that the same reason  Or you just  I'm too addictive  And again  I spent a lot of that time  On Craigslist 
[02:55:30]  And Backpage.com  So I can't say  That I don't understand  The addictive  I just don't want to  Waste my energy  It's got to be a good game  These days though  Because I used to go out  And buy like a shitload of games  And I'd be playing them  All the time  But now like  This one is the big game  That's out right now  And how many  How much  Did the game cost  60 something  And you're like  This is worth it  Yeah yeah  I think it's worth it  I just wish  I was better  Stupid fuck dick fan  Remember fan  That used to work here  Sure Nathaniel  He is 
[02:56:00]  The best player  Ever  At this  He is great  He plays non-stop  Video games  Yeah he doesn't go to work  That's all he does  I know  Does he play a lot  I think  Yeah that's all he does  All day  Isn't he getting a gig  At Rockstar or something  Game testing  I heard something about that  He was helping Lazlo  Wait is that good  Dude he's crazy  He levels up  Like he'll already  He'll buy the game yesterday  He'll already have topped  The level out  And have every weapon  And he just 
[02:56:30]  You look at his  Kill to death ratio  And it's astounding  I'm like  What is he doing different  Like sometimes  I'd even follow him  And if I'm in a group  Of like  I'm in this virtual  You know  Group of  Ten people  I'll be the guy  That gets it  Right between the eyes  As we all come around a corner  Just me  That's amazing  I don't understand  I follow Than  I'm doing everything he's doing  And I get picked off  If I come out of a hallway  And I quickly turn left 
[02:57:00]  To see what's there  Someone will be to the right  And shoot me  I will never look  In the proper direction  Oh good  Left  I look left that time  Alright I'm gonna aim  At this doorway  I'm just gonna sit here  With my back to the wall  And aim at this doorway  Even though there's  Another doorway  To my left  Let me for a second  Check that left doorway  The second I look  The guy comes in the door  I've been scoping out  For a half hour  And blast me  Now  I suck  How often does Stan play  Do you play every day?  Oh beyond every day 
[02:57:30]  He's on there  All the time  He used to  At one point  I haven't talked to him  In a long time  But at one point  Before he had any job doing it  When he was supposed to be  Like writing jokes  He wasn't writing jokes  He was just playing video games  And he literally sat there  With a timer  Because it was  It got to the point  That it was out of control  He would wake up  And he'd just play  Like he sat there  With an oven timer  And had to give him  But he'd give himself  Like three or four hours  And that was the sacrifice  Only four hours a day  Yeah but that never works  Because as soon as  The timer goes off  You go  Ah  Let me just beat this one 
[02:58:00]  If you're in the middle  Of something  Let me give myself  Another hour  You know what else I do  That's fantastic  I'm constantly flashbanging myself  Is that good?  Is that like jerking off?  I'll throw the flashbang grenade  Into a room  And what it does  Is it goes  And the whole screen  Turns white  And you hear like a  And then you can walk  Right up to the guy  And just shoot him  Because he's totally dazed  I'll throw a flashbang  Into a room  And forget to turn away  And I'm flashbanged  And the next thing I know  The guy that I went to go get 
[02:58:30]  Is just killing me  Because I'm blind  Because I blinded myself  Or I'll go to throw a grenade  Into a doorway  And it'll hit the top of the doorway  And bounce back at me  And blow me up  I'm horrible at this game  I need lessons  Sounds like you enjoy it though  I love it  Can you get lessons  For a game like that?  I was like  I bet you could  I want lessons  I'll get you a 12 year old boy  To come to your house  I'm terrible  He'll teach you a thing or two  Or I'll panic  On the controller  And as I'm shooting at somebody 
[02:59:00]  In the middle of shooting him  I'll reload  Like with a full magazine  I'll be going  And it's like  Oh I think I got this guy  I inadvertently hit the reload button  And there I am reloading  As he's just stabbing me  Are those online guys  Using cheat codes?  No  It's harder to do that  It's a lot harder  They have it built into the  Into the game  Or it's a lot harder  To cheat with games these days  But some people  Are just like  That's all they do  They just play  Yeah  Oh when I try to climb up a ladder  And I fall off the edge of the ladder  And then I'm 
[02:59:30]  And all I'm thinking is  The guy that's going to kill me  Is watching me going  This guy can't even climb a ladder  In the game  I'm dead  Jimmy's mesmerized  I'm looking at this girl's  Pussy bulge  Sorry  She's doing a hula hoops  Wow look at her  Yeah she's got  Quite the camel toe on her  She's got like a thing on her  She's got like balls  I saw you like  Leaning forward  You were trying to see  If you could see something  Lips yeah  You were trying to see  I like big lips  I like big lips  The reporter right now  Is going  That's some camel toe  She's got on there  Good god 
[03:00:00]  Her camel toe  Looks like the Rocky Horror  Picture movie poster  She's laughing good naturedly  With his observation  Oh you  Alright well  I need lessons  Oh I'll be  Well actually I got  I got  Gym today  I got the workout  So then I could do that  After that  And has gym class  I got gym class  Because I didn't do it  In school enough  So I'm making up credits  You got gym  And then study hall  And then study hall  And then I could game  If mommy lets me 
[03:00:30]  Game  Yeah  Do you not go to the bathroom  Gaming  So that you're playing the game  Yeah yeah  There have been times  I've been in the middle  Do you wear diapers  Heated balance  Yeah yeah  Actually I'd just piss on the couch  If I could turn the cushion over  I pissed all over my sweatpants yesterday  By mistake  I was taking a leak  And I didn't realize  That my fucking hog  Was pointing right at the sweats  And I was whizzing on them  Instead of into the toilet  Oh  And then I was like  You know a better one than that  That's awkward  I've done this one  You ever have your sweats  On  And you just kind of 
[03:01:00]  Grab the top of the sweats  With your thumb  Or two thumbs  And pull it down  Sure  So you can leak  You ever have it slip off  Of your thumbs  In the middle of taking a leak  Oh yeah  It goes thwok  And just knocks your dick  And now you're just  Pissing in your sweats  Yes I have done that  Every type of urination mishap  You can involve it  I've had  Yeah  Yeah  There's the post-coital  Sprinkler pee too  Oh it's the fucking worst  And there's no knowing 
[03:01:30]  Where it's going  Or how to solve it  It's like a hydra  And you're just trying  To get a few of the  It's Medusa's head  And you're just trying  To get a few of those  Snakes in the bowl  All you have to do  All you do is  Squeeze your mushroom  And it comes back together  It kind of takes you  Off guard for a second  All you do  That's all you do  All you do  Or you gotta go  A little squeeze of the mushroom  You gotta push harder  To open up the  The blockage  The blockage  You ladies don't know  What us guys go through  With this dick thing  I actually will brush my nipples  I will brush my nipples  To relax myself 
[03:02:00]  And then I can pee easier  Honestly that's how I piss  Are you kidding  100% serious  That's awkward at the office  Yeah in public bathrooms  I gently touch my nipple  And my body just relaxes  You don't do that  In a public bathroom do you  No  You're like hey  Here's Jim Norton  Yes I am  I'm just trying to relax  A little bit  Do you need to relax sir  Why don't you join me  I'll try not to  What else is going on Jim  Anything in your world  Not much  Just doing the hang 
[03:02:30]  You know  Right in the new hour  You know Jim and I  Were talking about that  Yeah  It's like you do  The topical stuff  Which I feel like  You know like when you  Do observational stuff  And stuff on food  You're like alright  What food haven't  I covered here  But it's good  It's fun  It's really exciting  When you get that  New hour to a place  You're like alright  There's not like  It feels so fresh right  You don't have to go  To the old bag of tricks  Yeah  Which is very exciting  I have 
[03:03:00]  Some comics  Do not  No  Do the same way  It's amazing  They stand in their  Old bag of tricks  And just talk out of it  Oh my god  It is amazing  I've seen some comics  It's like  Just change your act  A little bit  For 20 years  Yeah  Oh yeah  Fucking lazy man  20 years  Yeah  Guys are lazy  Yeah with his bow tie  I didn't catch it  Hey it's a Kevin Meney joke  Oh  Well funny's funny though  I like having old jokes  To go to if you want to 
[03:03:30]  But it's like  It's nice to not have  To go to that  Oh the new joke  That's so fun  You know  Great  A new line  My gosh  Yeah  But then you burn it  On TV and it's heartbreaking  When you're done  With it on TV  You're like  I just can't do it anymore  Really  It's heartbreaking  You've killed it  Most times  I'll still do it  For a little while  But it's heartbreaking  I think it's kind of cool  Although then you go to the show  And you see that  Yeah but it's kind of contingent  On catching you off guard  Drown your little jokes  In the bathtub  Yeah  There really are  Like fucking too many kittens  Or I just throw them in the river  And then somebody YouTubes it 
[03:04:00]  Can I go to the  I gotta go to this call  Because we were talking about this  During the break  And I guess it is true  Justin in Tampa  Go ahead  Hey man  I saw on TMZ  Jimmy Norton's little  Childhood hero  Reggie Jackson  Apparently he shit himself  Oh yeah  When he was with the A's  Oh really  As a player  Middle of the game  What's that boy  How do you shit yourself  During a game  I don't know  You know  Maybe he had too much  Indian food  I mean  Yeah you wonder  If it was illness 
[03:04:30]  We've all come close  You know  You wonder if it was illness  Or if it was just  One of those things  How does TMZ  Get that information  I know  He's like  Was he like drunk at a bar  And he's like  You're not gonna believe  What happened  When I was with the A's  Yeah why now  This is before I got  The candy bar  I had my own candy bar  It was a disaster  And you know  We were wearing white pants  It was horrible  Yeah he could've just said  He sat on a Reggie bar  I have them all over the place  I had one in my back pocket  That's all I was  For free 
[03:05:00]  And rumor  Innuendo  It just like highlights  That information is out there  It's just like  Why?  Yeah it's just completely unnecessary  There's no need to know  That Reggie shit himself  I don't disagree  Well now that I know  I'm glad I do  But I didn't need to  I'll never look at him  The same again  I'll look at him now  With more love  He's my favorite ball player  So I'll really enjoy him  A lot more  He's so cranky to people  He wants no part of fans  You met him right?  Yeah I did  I got him to sign a ball  And took a picture  You could care less though right? 
[03:05:30]  Which one?  Yes he sat my ball with his foot  He was out here in the lobby  And the guy from the  Sports channel arranged it  Because Reggie is  He doesn't fuck around  They said he jumped the turnstile  To get up here  Like he wouldn't wait in the lobby  Like he wasn't going to wait  For these security douchebags  He just hopped the turnstile  And they were pissed off  And they're like  Someone's like  If you give an autograph  They'll be okay  And he just refused  No  I'm not giving him an autograph  Wow  I didn't not love Reggie  That's awesome  What a crotchety fucker  He's been fucking 
[03:06:00]  Hounded for fucking 30 years  He's done with it  He's done with fans  Yeah  You think?  He's had it?  I don't know  He was nice to me  Like moderately  Why?  He wasn't overly nice  But he was nice  In the fact that he did  Take the picture  Like okay come on  Like that  Oh he went okay come on  Yeah  Let's get this over with  Yeah that's nice  You know those late  You know the late 70s  Reggie Jackson  Probably couldn't go anywhere  Anywhere  No no  Anywhere  He was the shit  And what was he  He's probably so bitter too 
[03:06:30]  Like what was he making  As opposed to like A-Rod  Oh my gosh  700,000  600,000 a year  Yeah and people were  Criticizing him back then  Can you believe  This guy makes all that money  This guy's making  An entry level baseball player  That's why when people  Went after A-Rod  A couple years ago  I'm like  It's only a matter of time  Before they all make  Insane money  Yeah yeah  I mean not that  They're not making  Insane money  What was Reggie's  Biggest salary  Because I know that  Steinberg at one point  Said he would never  Pay someone more than  A million 
[03:07:00]  I think it was  At the Angels  Probably right  George said that  Like a month  Before he died  I'll never pay  Any  Well okay  Grandpa  See because he's  He was seen  Oh I didn't  When Mattingly  Got a 19.5 million  Dollar contract  I think Steinberg  Said he wouldn't  Pay someone 20 million  He'd never pay  20 million dollars  For a player  When Don signed  A 19.5 million dollar  Contract  It was a big deal  I think it was  A five or six year deal  What was his highest  Salary  Do we have that  Oh boy  Reggie's  Yeah I'm just curious 
[03:07:30]  I'm gonna guess  600,000  He might have  Hit the million mark  At one point  I bet you're about right  Maybe 2.3 million  When he was with the Angels  No  You think  He was still good  When he was with the Angels  But the numbers weren't up  I don't know  Oh okay  I don't know  Steve  The most  He made 1.1 with the Angels  In 82  1.1 with the Angels  In 86  The most he ever made  With the Yankees 
[03:08:00]  Yeah  Was 588,000  And what year was that  1981  All right  Look in his biggest  Bells are made more  For a whole cult  Ten times at about  What was the  Jackson's biggest year  With the Yankees  When he was walking around  And couldn't do anything  That was his big  World Series  Three home runs  Home runs  525  525,000  525  That's a $200,000 salary  $400,000 bonus  And what is that 
[03:08:30]  660,000  What is that  I don't know  Def  Deficit  Deferred  Deferred  Deferred  Probably like  If you made  The playoffs  And shit like that  Incentives  Yeah I remember  There used to be  Things like  These players  Have made the playoffs  Now they get  $5,000  Yeah yeah  It's an incentive  For them  They used to  Backload those contracts  Oh did they  So deferred payment  He could be  Oh gotcha  Some people  That have retired 
[03:09:00]  Ten years ago  Are still getting paid  Oh wow  Because that's the way  That these teams  Are able to afford them  Gotcha  So early on  They're making shit  While they're playing  And then later  Yeah  Like if  If you sign like  A hundred million dollar deal  You might make  20 million the first year  And then like  You know  It'll gradually go up  20 million  And then you'll make money  For the next 20 years  But they want that money  To point baseball  Exactly  Stop it  But when you sue  Hulk Hogan  You get that 5 million  Pretty fast 
[03:09:30]  You get 5 mil  You're taking a little  Bump on the head  I'm gonna sue  Cain Velasquez  Yeah go ahead  That's right  It's not a bad idea  Yeah  Can we get a taste  Look at him in court  Just stare at him in court  That would be so great  I felt the belt  That he was carrying around  Heavy right  And I'm so lazy  I'm like  Oh gosh  I feel sorry for the guy  I happened to carry this around  It's so heavy  I'm gonna be in Poughkeepsie  On the 19th and 20th  Oh yes  Because  Which is really cool  Because you know  Jim's doing the Nokia theater  So I figure I'll do  Bananas Poughkeepsie  November 19th and 20th 
[03:10:00]  Tickets may be available  And I think you're doing  Humiliating  You're doing Chelsea Handler tomorrow  And Jay Leno Friday  Yes  You're leaving us  You're on Lake Leno  I know all the time  Aren't you  Yeah they've given me  A lot of stuff man  This is the same  I think this is  Love Advice  When me and Jay  Worked out well  The last time  Yeah yeah yeah  It was a good segment  We just kind of sit there  And people  Feel questions from the audience  And give like  Love Advice or whatever  I know I had to explain  What Love Advice was  Everybody knows  Fucking asshole I am

I don't know  We're going to find out  Don't they put those  Wacky little mics  That fit behind your ear  And stuff?  Colin had one on last night  You could hardly see it at all  Yeah?  When he did it  At the smaller theater  Was he holding a mic?  No  It was a little one  On his head  Oh okay  And you could barely  See the line  Oh  It's great  I'm sorry I'm yawning  I'm very sleepy  I'm a little under the weather 
[03:11:30]  Really?  Yeah  Aren't we always under the weather?  Hey  Hi-yo  I'd rather be guillotined  Right side  Back to the right  Both hands  Right side  Pardon  To the left side  I shit my pants last night  I did  Went out and had a great meal  Just a great fucking meal  I had to go to the bathroom  So bad in the car  I'm going  Travel  Hurry up  I gotta shit  I had fucking shit in my pants  I'm good twice a year for that 
[03:12:00]  When was the last time  You shit your pants?  Yeah  Been a while?  It's been a while  I was in Vegas a couple years ago  Just an honest to God  True story  Staying at the Bellagio  I went over to Mirage for dinner  Met some friends of mine over there  Went to Kokomo  It's a great little steakhouse  The guy brings out  Some fresh crab legs  He said  These just came in  I gotta give them to you guys  I'm eating them  Then we go play  Gamble a little bit  I had a tea time  Early in the morning  So I said  Look I gotta get going 
[03:12:30]  I'm walking back to the hotel  I get three quarters of the way  Out of the lobby  And all of a sudden  I go  Oh fuck  And I'm standing here like this  I got my butt pinched  So fucking  I'm fucked  I can't move  All of a sudden  You know  Felt alright  I went just like this  Water  I had some food poisoning  From the crabs  Take off my leather jacket  Tied it around my waist  And I'm just standing there  And it's just running down my leg  I got jeans on 
[03:13:00]  Black bucks  No socks  And I just start fucking walking  Every time I'm walking  Something's coming out  It's water  Straight fucking water  Then  Tell you how sick I was  Tell you how sick I was  Then I'm standing outside  And I got on my cell phone  And I called the guy  I said  Larry you won't believe this  I'm standing outside  The fucking Bellagio  I can't move  I got shit everywhere  I shit all over myself  And Larry's about a 48  Waist  So he brings me over  A pair of pants  And some towels  And some towels 
[03:13:30]  And so he then  He comes over  And he meets me  I tell him where I'm standing  He finds the closest bathroom  When you go up the escalator  You go into the  I can't get in the elevator  It's come on  Clock at night  You know  So he goes in  He finds the closest bathroom  In the lobby of the hotel  And then I get in the escalator  And he kind of  Pretends like he dropped something  So no one gets behind me  Tells me where it is  I go in there  He goes and gets the towel  All wet for me  Throws it over the fucking stall  I take off all my fucking clothes  Just wipe off  Leave my shoes 
[03:14:00]  Left my shoes  My pants  Everything right there  The towels  Right there in the stall  And I'm walking barefoot  With my shirt  And his pants  That are 48 waist  Through the lobby like this  Midnight  Got up in the morning  Took the most perfect  Double tapered shit  I've ever had in my life  True story  Who's the pitchers in this game?
