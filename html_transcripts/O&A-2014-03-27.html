<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a darkly humorous discussion of the missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370 and graphic footage of recent train accidents. This segued into a conversation about NYC public transportation, contrasted with the hostsâ€™ preference for personal vehicles.  The show then shifted to a heated debate regarding the Adam Carolla podcasting lawsuit, focusing on their anger towards "patent squatters."  A caller, Brad, a former Diamond Vision employee, and another caller, Lisa, an eye doctor, offered insights into LASIK surgery and its potential side effects, triggered by the initial discussion. Further calls delved into the intricacies and implications of the lawsuit, with callers detailing the strategies of patent trolls. The segment concluded with the hosts showcasing their new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phones and smartwatches, highlighting technical issues, and drawing a parallel between patent infringement and a new pastry shop using a similar name to "cronut." Sal, a show employee, was mentioned as being in studio due to Sam's illness.

The next segment started with a discussion on silencing smartphone camera shutter sounds, focusing on iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices, including a caller offering a solution for the Samsung Galaxy S4.  This transitioned into a discussion of the movie *Flash of Genius*, with one host revealing his role as an executive producer.  Further attempts to silence the shutter sound on a Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch ensued, marked by frustration and expletives. Sam Roberts' early departure due to illness was met with skeptical and humorous commentary from the remaining hosts, who speculated on alternative reasons.  The upcoming guests, Jay Moore and Mindy Kaling, were introduced, followed by a discussion of Sammy Hagar versus David Lee Roth in Van Halen, and the death of Mick Jagger's girlfriend.  A significant portion of the segment was dedicated to a video from their "Real Rock TV" YouTube channel, showcasing a skiing prank in Maine.  The hosts also discussed temperature discrepancies on their smartwatches and phones, briefly mentioned a North Korean leader mandating hairstyles, and finally interviewed Jay Moore about his upcoming comedy shows.

A substantial portion of the following segment focused on the optimal level of intoxication for playing poker, with the hosts favoring a "nice buzz."  This transitioned into a comparison of the hosts' past radio experiences with a nationally syndicated radio host guest (with 152 stations), who described the stricter scheduling of larger networks. The discussion then moved to topics resonating with wider audiences, focusing on the popularity of race and sexuality over sports news, even on sports shows, leading to a discussion of Michael Sam.  A significant portion of the show featured a comedic dissection of a video clip showing Mike Francesa falling asleep on air.  The latter half covered the guest's comedy shows, specifically low ticket sales in Long Island, at "The Space at Westbury," leading to tangents on the guest's fertility struggles, penis size comparisons,  and the relative merits of quick versus drawn-out sex. The segment ended with further discussion of the Westbury venue, a call about a local Long Island bar, and some humorous theories about the missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370.

The next segment opened with a vulgar discussion about an "over 40 swingers club" and age preferences.  This was followed by a phone interview with Steve Gorman of the Black Crows, focusing on their musical career, longer jam sessions, and his side project, Trigger Hippie.  The conversation included references to other musicians like Chris Robinson, Rich Robinson, and Jimmy Page.  Jay Mohr then joined the show, contributing to the vulgar banter, discussing his stand-up comedy, experiences with Kate Hudson, and sports opinions. Mindy Kaling subsequently joined, discussing her career, stand-up comedy, *The Mindy Project*, dealing with public perception and online criticism, and her preferences in men.  The conversation concluded with discussions about various television shows and comedic styles.

The final segment focused on the boundaries of humor and the use of taboo subjects. The hosts debated whether certain topics are inherently off-limits or if the effectiveness depends on execution.  One host used an example of a humorous storyline involving a character sleeping with an intoxicated woman, contrasting it with contemporary television sensitivities. Lazy comedy relying on shock value was critiqued, as was a female comedian's strategy of using shocking personal experiences for humor. Mindy Kaling briefly promoted *The Mindy Project*, followed by a call from Zannie Branch expressing admiration for Kaling and inquiring about a potential future book. The segment concluded with a short discussion of favorite television shows, including *Taxi*, *M*A*S*H*, *Seinfeld*, and *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh boy. Morning everyone.  The show is on the road I think, right?  I guess. Or in this box that we sit in every day.  Wrong headphone jack. There we go!  Pull out some ears.  Ah!  So I guess we found the plane debris. 
[00:00:30]  We're good now.  Again?  It's the story that won't end.  It's fucking...  Look, and they're on the big map.  Jimmy loves this map.  Look, the plane made a left turn.  Oh yeah, look.  I guess they found hundreds of pieces of debris on a satellite.  Yeah.  But nothing's been picked up out of the ocean yet.  And there's been no confirmation as to what it is.  And these satellite images are three, four days old. 
[00:01:00]  So by the time they show us, we can't help them anymore.  Oh, we have...  We're no help.  We're no help whatsoever.  I try.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Let's find the plane already.  It goes on and on.  One piece.  One little fucking coffee cup floating in the ocean that says Malaysian air.  Ah, one piece that just has the letter M on it would be good enough at this point.  Yeah, and they haven't brought back anything.  But they're walking on the map again.  Don't you dare walk in Australia. 
[00:01:30]  They just walk in Australia like it's no big deal.  Yeah, look.  Well, they like staying in the middle of the ocean.  Well, now they're in the middle of the ocean.  But they love just standing right on Australia with their dirty feet.  And they point at the plane.  I bet you they wouldn't, you know, stand on Afghanistan like that.  The other screen is showing that train that crashed into the platform.  Oh, and the body parts?  No, no.  That was a different one.  This is the one where a train just crashed.  It's a video of the train crashing into the platform. 
[00:02:00]  It looks like an action movie.  How did it crash into the platform?  I guess somebody didn't step on the brakes.  It hit like an escalator.  What do you mean he fell asleep?  Did these guys stop falling asleep?  Yeah.  Trains are pretty easy to control.  As long as you're not sleeping.  That's probably why they fall asleep.  I thought you meant the other one.  Oh, that guy.  Where was that?  I think it was in New Brunswick.  Yeah.  Train comes in, takes out a person that's leaning over the platform.  And the body parts went flying in.  The body parts, I guess, injured people. 
[00:02:30]  Injured other people.  Like a fucking flying head, an arm.  What do you mean a flying head?  They said a flying head?  He was peeking his head out over the platform.  You've got to peek, though.  And the train hit him.  No, you don't.  I'm a peeker.  You've got to peek a little bit.  If there's a train in front of you, you know the train's there.  There's no reason to peek.  Although, one of the best things the subway system here in New York City did was showing you when the trains are coming.  Finally.  They've had this technology forever for all the other cities.  Yeah, they show you. 
[00:03:00]  And New York finally got this where it says, okay, the one train.  Three minutes out.  Yeah, exactly.  So you don't have to do the peek anymore.  You know what's even better?  What's that, Travi?  Now, on all the buses, they're all fitted with GPS.  Right.  And you can watch on your cell phone where the bus is.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Maybe Jimmy needed that for his 911 call.  He would have known that.  Where it was, he could have said it said GPS coordinates.  That's right.  My new action film is called Bus Tracker.  It's about a man who finds all lost buses in the city with his cell phone. 
[00:03:30]  How often does it happen?  Probably once every seven, eight months.  That's terrible.  Yes, it is.  Are the city buses good?  I've never been on a city bus.  Yeah.  I mean, I take them.  Oh, my God.  You know, I have never been on one either.  I kind of want to just go on one to check it out.  Oh, my goodness.  I never took one until Sandy, and we didn't have a subway.  Yeah, right.  And now I just, I keep taking it because.  It's not bad?  Well, that time of day, it's not bad because there's traffic.  I wouldn't want to take it.  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable?  I've walked a lot faster than the buses. 
[00:04:00]  Than the bus?  Many, many times.  Yeah, I wouldn't take like a crosstown bus.  Crosstown buses in Manhattan, I swear to you.  Stuck in traffic.  On any given day, you could walk faster than the bus.  With the dregs of society.  And people still will squeeze into the bus to go slower than a human being walking on the sidewalk.  It's really strange.  And who looks more pained than people waiting for a bus during like a horrible, cold, snowy day?  Right.  They're just like shaking and steam is just flying out of everyone's face at the bus stop. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  No, thank you.  I'll be in my Escalade.  Escalade.  Search for the flight recorder.  Why don't they just get Escalades and drive in?  And I don't understand it.  Sorry.  I was doing the headline on CNN.  Oh, what was it?  Search for the flight recorder.  Oh, they're still searching for those.  And they have the countdown.  I think we're down to 12 days or something.  Oh, boy.  13 days.  Something like that.  I don't know.  And they're starting to go over to the mud story, I guess? 
[00:05:00]  They're starting to, you know, they finally address the fact that there's a lot of people killed in that mudslide in Washington.  What, they weren't sure at first?  Well, at first, it was just a few people killed and then a few missing.  Now there's a fuckload missing and, I guess, 90 people missing.  I learned that in Washington State, there's a lot of areas like this that have unstable earth.  Yeah.  This place was warned back in the 90s.  Some guy said, hey, the exact area said, hey, that could be a devastating mudslide, landslide. 
[00:05:30]  And they said, okay, we'll look into it, and then built houses.  Built them cheap, I'm sure.  Whoops.  At the time.  Yeah.  Something about the Ice Age, that came in and made this area very unstable.  Damn.  With whatever's in there, I don't know.  Damn.  So that's just a horrible, horrible tragedy.  Tragedy.  Number of missing drops to 90, but that's still 90 people that will probably be dead. 
[00:06:00]  You might have one or two that, you know.  24.  Were they counted in the original missing thing?  Did they drop it down just because they counted some as the thousand?  No, there was like 150 or something at some point.  50 or 60, something like that.  Yeah.  So I guess they found some people.  Right.  People just on vacation, you know.  Yeah.  Family goes, ah.  What do you shit dicks think about Carolla being sued to shut down podcasts?  That is fucking so...  It's some kind of...  Yeah, it makes me sick.  It's people that squat on patents. 
[00:06:30]  It's the patent squatters.  Right.  And there are certain patents that are inherent to podcasting, I gather.  Right.  And they sit there and then they try to get money out of whoever is using their patent.  It has to do with the technology, I guess, right?  Yeah, it has to do with the technology end of it.  But can't you just do your podcast a different way that doesn't use that particular technology?  I don't know.  I don't know.  There seems there would be a workaround to that somehow. 
[00:07:00]  There might be.  But I know this problem is in a lot of other industries, too.  Patent squatters.  I think it sucks for Adam Carolla and the guys.  I know all those guys are getting together trying to fight this thing.  Yeah, they're all going to pull up to help.  It's a strange little loophole that's going on.  He's got a fund anything account where you can donate to his legal fees because it costs millions of dollars to fight these.  That's why they get paid because these motherfuckers just say, well, it's going to cost you a lot more to fight it than it would just to pay me off. 
[00:07:30]  That's how they make their living.  They should just summarily be executed.  Who's the guy?  Or be summarily executed.  I don't know.  I don't know all the details of this.  I know it's a patent on the technology that allows you to podcast.  Is Pat Oswald involved in this?  I think so.  Why?  Because his name is Pat.  I think so, yeah.  I can't believe I didn't.  You could dish him out.  You can't understand him.  No, you know what it was?  He doesn't have a podcast, so I didn't see the relevance of bringing him in. 
[00:08:00]  I see.  But I heard this mention.  Someone else had told me about this a long time ago.  Yeah.  And I have such a visceral loathing for a guy who does that.  Just a scumbag.  A leech.  It's a leech.  It's a pilot fish.  It's a fucking, just a problem.  Right there, just sapping on to people that are trying to actually make something of themselves.  But the podcasters should figure out the workaround.  There's got to be a workaround where they all could go, all right, screw you.  We're doing it this way now.  There has to be.  It could be the actual, like, I don't know, but it could be the actual technology of broadcasting 
[00:08:30]  your voice over the internet.  And that's like what some guy has.  So how do you work around that?  That's what it is.  Yeah, okay.  He's being accused of infringing on personal audios patent, blah, blah, blah.  System for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence.  Okay, there you go.  Wow.  Are we involved with this?  Jesus.  So anyone that's doing that online, doing a scheduled broadcast like that, he has the 
[00:09:00]  idea of a scheduled broadcast patented.  What a cocksucker.  Wow.  I hope he has insurance.  Yeah.  It's hard to get insurance for still.  I mean, not hard, but I hope he has it.  Yeah.  But it doesn't affect all those guys?  Yeah.  I'm sure it does.  Is he the only one being named?  I'm bored.  Well, I think there's a few guys.  I'm not sure.  I think you have to, like, probably individually sue everybody.  He's the high profile guy.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, because this guy knows that he can go after Adam. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Who's got a lot of money.  And get the headlines, too, for doing it.  So obviously, yeah, that sucks, to answer your question.  He's out of who's shabby.  It sucks for Adam Carole and the rest of the guys going through that.  So what's your guys' name soon?  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, it's a company.  The company's called Personal Audio.  Who are you?  I'm Sal.  Why are you there?  Ew.  Why are you there?  Sam wanted me in the studio today.  Why?  I think he said he was sick.  Sam's sick? 
[00:10:00]  That's what he told me.  That was a rare.  Is he home?  No.  He hosted the pre-show.  He did?  Yes, I saw him.  God, why don't we listen to our own channel?  I don't know.  I don't know.  So what is he doing for the day?  I don't know.  He just said, I'm going home after the pre-show.  Oh, okay.  So he did go home.  Wait, he's going home?  I'm pretty sure, yeah.  Oh, he must be just...  Wow.  I think he's in bad shape, yeah.  I say the kid's on the drugs.  I think so, too.  He's built up something.  He's got this thing. 
[00:10:30]  He's doing the fame thing really quickly.  He had a couple of shots on the WWE thing.  Right.  And now he just decides, I'm going to start doing the drugs.  He's doing the drugs?  He's on the drugs.  Oh, boy.  That's the rumor.  I want to start.  He probably has an ice bag on his head, old school somewhere.  That's a good thing.  So does his voice sound normal now?  Oh.  Because if he's sick, he might actually sound like a man.  He might have a deeper voice.  That's a good one.  My voice is just shot. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  My voice was never this deep.  No, it's just gone.  No, I think it's just scratched to shit.  Your voice gets deeper as your hearing gets worse.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what it is.  I think it's just all those dumb years of yelling and screaming took its toll.  The sounds I get to hear in my ears from tinnitus.  It's like the audio version of a lava lamp going off in my head.  Just all this.  I don't have that, thank God.  I think that's when you were in bands or something. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, I think that's what it was.  Because I don't have that.  I just can't hear in restaurants and stuff.  What do you say?  I can hear, but barely.  Have you ever heard the specials?  Huh?  Have you ever heard the specials?  Oh, God, no.  I just nod.  I just nod.  And I get bummed out because I know there's something really good there, probably.  You never hear the specials?  I know, I'm too embarrassed.  Like, I should be on one of those commercials.  With the hearing aid guy?  Yeah, I'm too embarrassed to tell her to repeat it.  So I just sit there and make believe.  Oh, whoa.  And then there's the clip after you get the hearing aid. 
[00:12:00]  You'll be sitting there with the menu going, I'll have that.  Right, right, right.  Exactly.  Now I can hear the specials.  Oh, God, no.  Sometimes I'll hear salmon, chutney, chutney, chutney.  Yeah, you just hear key words.  Today we got shrimp.  We got flour.  And then you just nod.  Oh, oh.  Oh, you look at who you're with.  That sounds delicious.  Right.  I have no idea what they said.  I hate restaurants that, like, fancy up their dishes, too. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And then you get it's just chicken, but how they say it, they put two, like, I don't know,  it's two little things on it.  Delicately infused with it all.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Well, if it's delicately infused.  Delicately.  Wow, well, thank you for that.  I'm on the motherfucker.  That's funny.  Yeah, I haven't heard specials in, God, I thought you meant the band for a second.  No, no, it's just.  No, I haven't heard specials in a restaurant in years.  I like when they put it up on the blackboard in the place, but then I have to get my glass. 
[00:13:00]  Well, that's the other problem, because my eyes went, too.  Oh, no.  My LASIK surgery.  They told me at the time it was.  War off?  It would last about 10, 12 years.  Yes, I'm having the same thing.  And now I need glasses to drive.  It's like flowers for Algernon.  You have eyes.  I don't need glasses full-time, though, but for the dumb, I don't need it for reading.  I could read all that tiny font.  It's like driving, movies, being in a restaurant and trying to see the specials board. 
[00:13:30]  I had to go to retard font.  It literally says retard font on my phone.  That's how giant it is?  Yeah, giant.  Would you get a touch-up?  I'm thinking about it.  My left eye is bothering me.  I think I strained it a little bit.  And I'm like, I wonder if it's just from too much computer.  No, no, no, no.  My throat will be strained.  But no, that's just too much looking on the computer.  I was told at the time that middle age will take out the LASIK a little bit.  So you're going to lose yours in like five years, then?  Exactly.  So I want to try to take care of it now before I bump off. 
[00:14:00]  Before it happens.  Can you get a touch-up, though, that LASIK?  I don't know.  I have no idea what the technology's at.  I'm debating.  I used to be all in with that guy.  He became my friend, and then he freaking died.  Diamond Vision.  If an eye is deceived, they pluck them out.  That's what I say.  If an eye is deceived, they pluck them out.  You've got to go old school with these medical problems.  I hear you.  Mm-hmm.  I love the guy from Diamond Vision.  He was a great guy.  Diamond Vision.  We sold a lot of procedures for that guy.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Remember?  Yeah.  What was his name?  I just said that he's a good guy, and I swear to you I'm having a brain fart as you say that.  I just heard his name.  Oh, my God.  I need to know his name.  Dr. Philatoff.  Philatoff.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Dr. Philatoff.  He was a solid dude, man.  I guess the company went on without him, sort of.  Yeah.  They tried to advertise again when we first went back to radio or whatever.  Yeah, maybe I'll give him a call, see if there's some procedures. 
[00:15:00]  See if there's a touch-up.  Yeah.  I could see distance, fine, but, man, that close-up shit now, it's literally painful.  Really?  If I look at something too long, and too long is like a few minutes.  Right.  I get this fucking feeling in my head like I was stabbed with an ice pick.  It's, yeah.  I got reading glasses thrown around my house like Johnny Appleseed came through with them.  Oh, smart.  Yeah, because I would be upstairs going, they're downstairs, downstairs. 
[00:15:30]  They're upstairs.  They're in my bag.  They're in the car.  Now I bought a fuckload and literally threw some in my bedroom, threw some downstairs.  That's what parents do with pacifiers when they have a newborn.  A little nookie?  You throw pacifiers all over the place.  Yeah.  So they could find one.  So they could just find them.  That's what you did with your glasses.  Just fucking sew them.  Yes.  If they beat Corolla, they're just going to take out every other podcast one by one, including 
[00:16:00]  yours eventually.  Ours.  The hell's up with ours?  Ours is so far down on their list.  Only because...  Ours.  It's guys like...  The guys that they're going after, they're called a patent troll.  Yes.  And I feel like my jaw is getting tight as I just read...  I have such a loathing for this legal procedure shit because they know how to tie you up financially.  Yep.  So the EFF, which is the Electronic Frontier...  Am I saying that wrong?  Electronic is something I probably should know that I just read it and I can't find.  What is that, Sal? 
[00:16:30]  Electronic Frontier Foundation.  It is.  Foundation.  Are helping to fight the patent.  So they have all these people donating to it.  So now with this company, which they're called Personal Audio, is subpoenaing EFF to get donor information.  It's just another...  There's no reason they need donor information on who's donating.  It's not their business who's donating, but in the legal system, when you start...  It's a threat.  It's a fucking tactic.  If you donate, we're going to...  Yeah, maybe we'll come after you. 
[00:17:00]  So what do they want in the end?  They just want to get paid, I think.  How much?  I haven't read the lawsuit.  I don't know.  I literally have not read the lawsuit.  But it's a never-ending thing.  It's not like how much do they want to get paid.  Then they'll just move on to the next guy, the next guy, the next guy.  They probably want a taste of every podcast.  They want a settlement.  They want a settlement with each one and a taste of everything.  And this isn't so much as to win this fight so then he can go on to someone else.  This is to change the whole fucking way this operates.  So the podcast guys have got to figure out a workaround.  No, they've got to change the way this fucking patent system works with this technology. 
[00:17:30]  Or maybe there's another technology they can use.  Maybe another one.  Or the patent was put through in 2009.  So it wasn't like 2012 it finally went through and Corolla was doing this since 2009.  He was doing it before it actually went through.  Yeah.  It's more than just Corolla against this guy.  It's the whole industry.  I don't know.  More importantly, let's say hi to Brad in Jersey who works for Diamond Vision. 
[00:18:00]  Oh my goodness.  Do you really?  I used to be the CEO of Diamond Vision and I was very close friends with Medeem Phillips.  I've been to, I'm now a consultant for them.  But as far as you having a touch-up on your eyes, the only issue is right now, I assume  prior to the surgery, if I recall correctly, you were nearsighted, right?  Wow.  How do you know about my eyes?  That's creepy.  Oh shit.  Am I a big deal at Diamond Vision?  You're like a big celebrity.  Am I a big deal on the wall? 
[00:18:30]  You an LT?  I sure hope so, because I'm not at my high school, so maybe I'm a big deal at Diamond  Vision at least.  You're on the wall of fame in our Garden City office.  They keep it local, right?  Nice.  Yeah, I was nearsighted.  Yeah, so back then, distance was trouble for you and of course there's no problem.  Right.  Now, I assume you're a little bit over the age of 40, a little bit older than me.  All right.  A little bit.  What happens there, though?  A little bit, a little bit.  Everybody else, like 40, 45 years old, needs glasses for a reading, right? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Right now, that little bit of nearsighted that's kind of messing you up, fucking you up in the  distance is helping you out up close.  A little bit is helping you up close.  Oh no, I can see everything perfectly up close, which makes it a pain in the ass when I do have  my glasses on, because then when I look down, I can't see shit.  So now I'm starting to think bifocals.  I'm not doing bifocals.  Bifocals.  Bifocals.  Although, our bifocals are finally cool, because when we were growing up, that meant you were  a grandpa.  Well, there's no lines anymore.  Oh, there's no lines? 
[00:19:30]  Nice.  So I could slide into some bifocals and no one would know the difference.  All right.  All right.  I see what's going on here.  I'm not wearing glasses all the time.  That's the point with bifocals.  They make these blue eyes of mine too giant.  Oh, God.  I hate glasses that make people's eyes big.  It creeps me out.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Brad.  So, sir, yes.  No worries.  If you fix both eyes and got them touched up for distance, both eyes for distance, then 
[00:20:00]  you have to wear glasses for everything up close.  So basically, you're just swapping out a pair of distance glasses for a pair of glasses.  Oh.  Just based on age.  So, can we get the LASIK?  Chances are.  If you can go get about, I can give the number and everything to the guys offline, but  you have to come in and get evaluated, make sure your cornea is thick enough, the eyes  aren't, you know, aren't fucked up with, you know.  I had an injury years ago with my left eye.  Like, I think I got hit with a baseball or something.  So they didn't even know if I can get the surgery the first time.  So I had to go to a specialist who looked at my eye, and then he had to sign off and 
[00:20:30]  tell the philatops or whatever, whoever did mine, that, hey, it's okay.  But I was like an inch away from not being able to get it at all.  I got to tell you, back in, I think it was 99 or 2000, I got this done, and I remember  walking around Manhattan, I felt like I had superhero eyes.  Oh, man.  I was looking in apartments that were four or five stories high and could see detail in  these apartments.  It's a miracle.  I think at the time, I was better than 2020.  Is it that? 
[00:21:00]  2015.  2015, right.  It was unbelievable.  It's unbelievable what these eyes are supposed to say, if you get them tuned up right.  A brewer came, too.  He had his eyes done a little bit.  Dude, we got everyone done through Diamond Vision.  Hey, are things like Viagra and Cialis bad for your eyes, because of what they do to the  eye muscles in the back?  You caught that lens as you said, Jimmy?  No, no.  Are Viagra and Cialis bad for your eyesight?  I've heard they can be very bad for you.  It can be, but an isolate, yeah.  It's not a standard thing.  Yeah, pressure just on the road. 
[00:21:30]  It's probably the pressure thing.  Yeah, it's fun.  People take it quite a bit to have the surgery.  But, Jimmy, I did surgery with a buddy of mine, and you can get touched up, too, if  you want, but if you're over the age of 40, Jim, that would be the same thing.  Glasses for up close.  So, you could get that, but now you're going to need glasses to read.  Oh, is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Yeah, what happens when you hit, like, 40 to 45 is the muscles of the lens of the eye.  I could see well up close.  That's way more important to me.  You're going to cash that in, though, to see distance.  I'm not cashing that in to see distance.  That's it.  That's how it works now.  I'm not in the woods where I need to see a predator. 
[00:22:00]  You've got to see down the hall, don't you?  Good point.  So, when you're over 40, you've got to kind of make that decision?  Exactly.  It's either you want to, the best, I think, for what Opie does for a living, looking at monitors  and that kind of stuff, reading up close, I'd tuck it up, wear glasses to drive and whatnot.  But he models, too.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What about for reading?  Like, I could see great at a distance, but I can't fucking see up close.  What?  You might be good.  What do I do?  Stop reading that one website. 
[00:22:30]  That's what you should do.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's just the natural aging of the eye.  What will happen in time, though, is when you get older and you get, like, 60, 65,  there's a new type of lens they can put in the eye.  Oh, Christ.  Cataract surgery.  Oh, who needs that?  All the different depths.  Stop it.  My dad had that.  He was very happy with his cataract surgery.  Wait, why do you need to do that when you're 65?  Why not now?  That would happen.  You can do it now, too.  But basically, he's got a healthy lens in his eye.  You never want to trade or swap out healthy things.  I do.  I fucking swapped out my eye lens eight, nine times already. 
[00:23:00]  I do when I'm bored.  I want blues.  Fing, fong.  Fing, pal.  Go ahead.  Sorry, sir.  That's the name of your company.  Fing, fong.  All right.  When you get a cataract, you can't see shit.  Distance, clothes, nothing.  Basically, everything's cloudy.  When you go and you take the lens out, you can put a new fancy one in.  It's tough you see everywhere.  We're at the point where we're learning way too much about this.  About the eyeball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to learn.  Hold on.  I might go by Diamond Vision and say hi to the old guy.  Where are they located?  A lot of the people still there?  Yeah, man. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, Dr. Stetson and I came in when we did that second round of Dr. Stetson's, the new  medical director.  And he went down there.  Where's the hat?  We advertised with you guys.  Stetson.  Oh, that guy's still there?  Yeah.  And did the missus get remarried?  The missus did not get remarried.  Wow.  Bummer.  She's got three little boys at home, and they're all doing well.  I don't think they're little anymore.  Yeah, well, when he passed away, his wife had just given birth.  I know.  It was horribly tragic. 
[00:24:00]  I have one question, too, sir.  About the haloing you can get around, like stuff like street lamps, which I do get.  But I'm still glad I did the surgery.  What can you do about that?  Yeah, there's a newer technology called Wavefront Technology.  The brand name's called Custom View.  And the biggest claim to fame is that it helps people with lights at night.  They can figure out reasons why you don't see well that you can't typically determine with a standard eye exam.  With this new technology, it helps people with lights at night.  So you can get checked out, too, if you like. 
[00:24:30]  Where can I go to do that?  Diamond Vision on 44th between 5 and 6.  Oh, so you guys have it.  Okay.  Nice.  Thank you.  Exactly.  All right.  If you want me to talk to somebody offline, I'm happy to do it.  That's great.  Yeah, I don't know if you can help me, but sure.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  You got to take care.  Good talking to you, Brad.  Because I see life through rose-colored glasses as it is.  Oh, that's true.  Yes.  You know me, the eternal optimist.  Let's say hi to Lisa in Jersey.  Lisa.  Hey, good morning.  Are you an eye doctor?  I am.  Are you cute?  I'm very cute. 
[00:25:00]  I'm the clinical director for a practice in New Jersey.  Now, are you the doctor, or do you just kind of assist the doctor?  Right.  No, I'm the doctor.  You get the coffee, right?  Yes, I get coffee.  Oh, boy.  Hold on.  I serve dessert.  Very important question.  How many buttons do you undo as a doctor?  I make you undo all the buttons.  Oh, nice.  My Russian doctor goes two or three.  Does she?  Oh, yes, she does.  She never does.  Are we opiating the same doctor?  We have a Russian doctor that has no problem undoing a few buttons. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  Yes.  That's full service.  That's what you want.  It's really awkward.  Totally full service.  Yes.  The guy that you just talked to absolutely knows what he's talking about.  You're going to trade one problem for another.  No, I'm good then.  You're driving at night, and you have to pop the glasses on, and it doesn't bother you.  It's not a big deal.  Well, but exactly, looking at monitors all day, having a touch-up done, you can, because  sometimes if the cornea is too thin, you can't have a touch-up, and if they do it, you're 
[00:26:00]  going to have what's called a corneal perforation.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  What's that?  What happened with that?  That's not good.  A corneal perforation, it's painful, but your vision becomes pretty much permanently distorted,  and you have to go into a heart contact lens.  Sounds like a hole in your cornea.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  I've got to be honest.  I never had a problem with my glasses until I picked up Jim Norton one day to check out  the damage from that super storm, and I didn't think anything of it until I saw this whack  job in the passenger seat smiling from ear to ear, and I turned, and I go, what? 
[00:26:30]  And then he had to point out my glasses.  There you go.  Do you remember that?  No, I don't at all.  Yes, you do.  I really don't.  No, no, I don't.  But I'm so used to seeing my friends in glasses, none of it's weird to me anymore, like...  Because I don't wear them around here.  It's only when I'm driving.  I've got to get a pair again.  It's like, you've just got to bite the bullet and get them.  I mean...  I got them.  I got them.  Me, me, me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've had glasses my whole life, and the contact lenses were a pain in the ass.  I was at the cellar last night talking to... 
[00:27:00]  I loved my contacts.  That became easy after a while.  If you get a little dust in them, or if there's a tear, it feels like you have a sledgehammer  in your eye.  I like the...  It's terrible.  I love the surgery.  It was great.  All right, Lisa.  Thank you.  Wish I did it years before.  Can I answer Jimmy's question about Cialis?  Yes, please.  Okay.  Here's what happens with Cialis and Viagra.  That's a big boner.  Basically, those medications divert blood flow.  So, when you divert blood flow, especially from the brain or from the eye, you can get 
[00:27:30]  what's called an optic neuropathy.  So, it's a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve, and the optic nerve just...it stops working,  basically.  And it usually happens about 24 to 48 hours after you take it.  But, you know, that's in what's called a patient population that's generally vascular  compromised.  So, at this point, you're pretty much safe to...  Is it permanent?  ...the Cialis that you want to...  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  It comes back in varying degrees, but it depends on the patient. 
[00:28:00]  I've probably seen, like, a half a dozen guys within the last, maybe, six years or so  that have had this happen.  But it doesn't happen to everyone, obviously.  No, no, no.  It's usually in somebody that already has hypertension or, you know, other cardiac issues, and they're  generally older, like, above the age of, like, say, 65 or so.  Okay.  Wow.  Because I heard it.  I know it does something with the blood flow.  I also get a little bit of dry eye, too. 
[00:28:30]  I guess they told me that could happen.  Patrice told me that Von had had that.  Like, she was using the drops for a while, like, way back before I got the surgery.  Ristacin?  Ristacis.  Is that what that is?  Oh, whatever it is.  I saw the commercial for it with that creepy eye doctor.  She's like, if you have chronic dry eye, and she's, like, staring at the camera.  My eyes get dry just looking at her.  My teeth get dry.  No, they don't have that, Edgar.  My eyes are dry.  You can't mistook.  No.  Try chewing gum, Edgar.  My heart drops on my teeth. 
[00:29:00]  No.  All right, Lisa.  Hey, fun to talk to you guys.  Thanks for having me.  Thank you, Lisa.  Of course it is.  Why don't you promote where you're at?  Maybe you get a few clients.  Oh, I don't know if I could do that or not.  Oh.  Yeah.  But I'm not far from where Jimmy grew up.  Let's put it that way.  Okay.  Oh, that's right.  All right, Lisa.  Very cool.  You're in Honolulu.  I grew up in Hawaii.  Bye.  This is nice.  David in North Carolina.  David.  He wants to go back to the Adam Carolla thing.  Oh, good.  Jimmy's definitely interested in this. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I'm just...  Go ahead.  What do you know on this, David?  Well, I don't believe you.  I'm not an expert on it, but I read something about the Adam Carolla thing.  Adam Carolla case in particular that said he actually started his podcast before these  people filed a lawsuit.  So that's one of the things that he has going for him.  Yeah.  And the other thing is, I don't know about these personal audio guys, but most of these  patent trolls are just big firms that have people just going through tons of paperwork  trying to find some patents that didn't get written properly or maybe patents expired. 
[00:30:00]  And they go, hey, we'll just re-patent this and it'll be ours.  I mean, it's just crazy.  There ought to be some kind of way we could...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just...  Like, here's my question.  Wow.  Are they just scumbag, like they say, trolls who just are going after people because of  some bullshit?  Or did they legitimately create something that is being used and they haven't been paid for?  They didn't.  That's what it is.  I don't know about the personal audio guys.  It's not the spirit of the patent law that, you know, initially when people needed protection 
[00:30:30]  for something that they had invented, came up with, you know, you got to look at the  spirit of the original intent.  And that was to protect people that came up with something.  And using a loophole so you could steal someone else's shit, it should be looked at and assessed  in that way and thrown the fuck out.  But I don't know what the case is with these guys.  I do.  Did they...  No, but did they create something, like legitimately create something? 
[00:31:00]  No, they're squatters.  Are they?  They're fucking patent squatters.  That's what I saw when Adam Carolla was pitching the whole thing.  Right.  He said they're trolls.  They're fucking...  What, what, what?  Sal wants to say something.  What they invented, Sal.  Sal, go right ahead.  Sal, hey!  Go ahead, Sal.  Sal, hey!  The floor's all yours.  Sal, go.  In this article it says EFF's Daniel Nazir, a staff attorney, says the organization became  involved because of its concerns relating to the decimation of free speech online.  Oh, stop. 
[00:31:30]  Mr. Nazir says it occurred to them in 2009 that they...  Well, yeah.  Go ahead.  It occurred to them in 2009 that they invented podcasting.  See, that's bullshit.  Oh, and it's their attorney saying they invented podcasting.  No, no, EFF, that's EFF's attorney.  Was that EFF's attorney?  Yeah, that's what I mean.  They're the ones fighting personal audio.  Are they?  Yeah.  The EFF has submitted some prior art and are arguing that the patent is anticipated  and obvious on the basis of that prior art.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Legal.  Horsesh.  No, prior art means it had been...  I'm guessing it had been done before, so you can't patent something that was already 
[00:32:00]  being used or whatever, or claim it.  Yeah, I think they're saying, and there's another thing here, it says EFF has much prior  art to the 1996 application.  So, I think they actually filed this in 1996, and they're trying to kind of apply their patent  towards a concept that they realized in 2009, like, oh shit, we invented podcasting back  in the mid-90s.  Right, so it would be like if you invented a tire, and all of a sudden you realize, oh  wait, cars use tires, 50 years, okay.  Exactly, so yeah. 
[00:32:30]  But did they actually, my question is, did they actually, how does that make them patent  trolls then?  Well, they came to the realization that they had a case, and then they filed a case.  It's still undergoing this case.  See, the legal shit, where it kills you financially, is the paperwork, and they do that.  A lot of people who know how to work the legal system are smart, and if you subpoena, like,  a thousand, or EFF's donor list, A, like you said, or someone said, that makes people  not want to donate, and they're afraid of the legal system, and it just bogs you down  in paperwork. 
[00:33:00]  The founder of Personal Audio.  Yeah, Jim Logan, right?  Yes.  This is based on his failed magazines on tape business, which is what he filed the patent  for.  Magazines on tape.  Episodic content.  Magazines on tape.  Well, yeah, but that's like probably books on tape.  Jesus.  Books on tape, what are they, like, they would read tape.  It's horrible.  Yeah, it's literally a cassette tape reading a magazine.  Hey, did he do the, uh, that porno audio tape that you guys played?  Yes, porn on tape was great.  Porn on tape. 
[00:33:30]  That's a great one, yeah.  So he says that he's entitled to royalties from podcasters, big and small.  But were they using his technology?  No, he filed the patent of what he was doing.  Oh, okay.  Episodic content.  Oh, so basically he's saying that it's not the technology, it's the concept of doing episodic  stuff online?  Yes.  That's ridiculous.  That's literally like doing a TV show, and then someone sues you because we had the  idea of breaking this into 30-minute increments.  Right. 
[00:34:00]  The sitcom.  The way these guys win is they don't necessarily win the lawsuit, but people like, like Corolla  are so tired of having to deal with it.  They settle out.  Yeah, that's on 99% of all cases, and is in a settlement, and they know that, and they  capitalize on bogging them down in paperwork and time and money.  And that's why they subpoenaed the people, because they realized this is a new thing,  and if you get a bunch of people donating, a lot of, I think they've got like $76,000 so  far I read donated.  $199,000. 
[00:34:30]  Is there more?  Oh, okay.  It was $200,000.  I was way off.  Yeah.  If you're donating to fight this, then all of a sudden the company who's tying you up  in paperwork or filing all these motions or whatever they are, then they have a real  fight on their hands, and they can get fucked legally.  Apparently Personal Audio won $8 million against the patent lawsuit against Apple.  Right, yeah.  They sued them a bunch of times over something.  But, yeah, what was it?  The jury found that Apple infringed on two valid patents relating to downloadable playlists with  its iOS devices. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  Amazing.  I'm out of here, guys.  All right, David, thank you.  I just want to know, and there's no way for me to know, because I have such a loathing  and hate, I keep saying that word, I apologize, a hatred of these lawsuits, but like how much  of it is legit.  Just because I hate it doesn't mean it's not legit.  They've sued or have entered licensing agreements with SiriusXM, Kobe, Rim, Samsung, Amazon, and  Motorola.  For playlist stuff?  Related to its downloadable playlist patents.  Man, it's fucking ridiculous. 
[00:35:30]  Exhausting.  Yeah.  Just preventing people from being creative and constructive on their own through some  fucking loophole.  It's not the way it's supposed to be.  It's detrimental to progress.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  And because he failed at it, now he's going to try to make money another way.  That's great.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  Good job, you motherfucker.  I would love, I had heard about this quite a while ago, I mean like two years ago I heard  about it, or a year and a half ago, about what was happening.  Oh, it's been going on for a while. 
[00:36:00]  It has been, yeah.  A couple of years at least.  I'm wondering, but he was trying to settle, and they couldn't settle, and he, then maybe  he decided to file a lawsuit.  This happens all the time.  Lawyers are in all kinds of industries to protect from this, the auto industry, everything.  You know, somebody comes up and says, hey, that's my idea for the fucking wingnut,  but, and then, hey, you've got to fucking pay, or settle, or go to court.  It's crazy.  And in the end, we all pay.  We all pay, because when somebody hires a lawyer for something, the cost is not absorbed 
[00:36:30]  by the person, for the most part.  It gets passed on to John Q. Public.  Is this interesting, because now more people want in?  I think his podcast is so massive, sure.  Ryan Fresno has more on this.  Ryan.  I was listening to the Joe Rogan podcast with Adam on it, and they're saying that it's  like one and a half million for, just for the lawyer, and it's three million for the settlement. 
[00:37:00]  What do you mean?  One and a half million to pay the lawyer, and then three million for the settlement.  So the guy wants four, so it's going to cost him four and a half million dollars?  Yeah.  So why a million and a half for the lawyer?  That's just what they were saying.  Wants and pays lawyer fees, probably.  Oh, God.  Rick.  Are they owned by a parent company?  Is Personal Audio owned by a parent company, or is that the actual parent company?  From what I heard, that's the actual company. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's Personal Audio LLC.  That's the first time I've ever heard of the company, is today.  And all it is, the patent is just a playlist.  That's all it is.  Mm-hmm.  No, I was looking over, and I was talking about episodic stuff, and I just, I don't know  enough about internet law, or any kind of law for that matter.  Why do I make it specific?  I'm acting like I have a fucking great knowledge of television law.  I'm not into, yeah, I don't know about patent law.  Yeah, but it's just technically correct, I don't. 
[00:38:00]  Divorce law, things like this, that's criminal law.  But no, you could sound smarter by saying that, like, well, I'm not really particularly familiar  with patent law, which makes it sound by default like I am familiar with other law.  But I should just say, I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm not familiar with the law.  I don't like the guy suing, because I like Adam.  But I, how can you subpoena, that annoys me that they're going to subpoena EF.  Why is it, like, why do they care who's funding EFFs fighting their patent sue?  What's the difference?  Well, we'll tweet out the link for Adam's cause there, so. 
[00:38:30]  It's O-N-Day Show on Twitter.  We'll tweet that right now.  Indeed he do.  All right.  We should take a break.  Yeah, oh, where the hell is our grub?  Yeah, Kenny's over there, he's over there doing, I like when he bushes up my eggs with  his feet.  Oh, you like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Turns me on.  He's over there laughing like a bunch of schoolgirls.  Hmm.  I need my grub.  Well, we'll have to eat on the air.  Yep.  How about that?  Well, the people, we'll be giving the people an extra treat. 
[00:39:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And I see you're a white glove today.  I'm white glove.  I hope it still works.  White glove!  Oh, yeah.  I didn't charge my watch.  So, but yeah, I got a white glove.  I got a white glove.  I know, I have a white glove.  And now that you can't see these phones, this Note 3's got to be great for you.  The Samsung Note 3 that we all got.  I do like that.  Do you like it so far?  Pretty fucking big.  We're going to have to do a whole thing here, but do you like it?  Yeah, I really do.  What do you like about the phone so far? 
[00:39:30]  That fucking, the giant screen and this, the video and photos are great.  Yeah, the media on this is amazing.  The videos look amazing on this thing.  Really good fucking pics.  And the pictures are good, too.  I'm going to say, hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  Did you use the watch?  No, I'm using the regular camera.  I figure I got it right in my hand.  Why not snap it?  No, I mean, do you, but do you use the watch?  For the time.  Can I see that answer?  You don't like it for text messages? 
[00:40:00]  I haven't gotten any texts on this phone yet because this is my, this was known as the  Naughty Boy phone.  Oh.  And I don't have anybody calling it or texting it, really.  Gotcha.  So, it's, uh.  You get a little vibrate on your wrist when you get a text message.  A little vibrate.  And then you look down and go, oh, look at that.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  That's a little blurry.  I got mine just sitting in boxes at home.  I can't wait to use it.  I wasn't holding still.  I don't have the thing on it because it was dark.  So, I got to go into the options and change my, oh, come on in, for Christ's sake.  Because it's a little blurry.  Oh, come on.  Maybe that's your eyes. 
[00:40:30]  No.  You're not a guy called back.  No, I swear.  Here, look.  I'll go into options.  I'll turn it back on.  There we go.  When are you turning it back on?  It's like a stabilizer.  Smart stabilization.  Where's that?  But in dark circumstances, you don't want to use that.  Why?  Because it makes the picture a little grainy.  But now I'll do this.  Okay.  There's Jimmy Norton.  Focus.  Perfect.  Wait.  Where's the stabilizer?  Oh, that's a processing, processing.  Where's the stabilizer?  It's in the options once you go into your camera screen.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, let me see Jimmy.  Look at me prowling the microphone. 
[00:41:00]  That's zoomed in.  That's a good pick.  Boy, do I look ugly.  No, it's beautiful.  No, I'm not homely.  But it's very clear.  It's clear.  It shows my homeliness.  Clear fucking pick.  Who's that homely boy?  That's good.  Smart stabilizer on or off?  On in light.  Yes.  Off in dark.  How did you figure that out?  I just kind of took some pictures with it on and off in the dark and light.  You learned, and you learned quickly.  Yeah, you got futz with these things.  You got futz with them.  Fuzz.  Stupid shop.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Stupid, Eric, to send me a picture of me with glasses on at WNEW before the LASIK surgery  holding a fake vagina.  A fake vagina.  Whose fake vagina was that, Eric?  I don't know.  Jesus.  White glove, Roland.  White glove.  Are you white-gloving?  What happened to your bus seat?  Oh, no.  That's exactly what I told you yesterday.  Now he doesn't have the phone or the watch.  It's the watch.  He's done.  He's done.  He gets excited for one to two days.  Talks on this stuff.  Now we're looking into the TVs now. 
[00:42:00]  Huh?  I'm moving into TVs.  Oh, you're moving into the Samsung TVs?  Oh, boy, I made that move 10 years ago.  Wait, I have a big wrist, so yesterday it kind of took place into my wrist.  No, you just make the watch bigger.  Then you make the watch band bigger.  I need a bigger band.  So you're over the Galaxy Note 3 already?  No, I...  You never turned it on?  Yeah, yeah.  I use that at my apartment.  You probably took a picture of yourself.  So are you white-gloving in the apartment or what?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  White gloves.  White gloves.  I take pictures in Brooklyn.  Oh, what's that?  I go white gloves, people white gloves.  Roland was snapping these cognito shots with the camera that's on the wristwatch on the train,  taking photos of homeless people.  It's not really that incognito, though, because you're going to have to put your arm up in an unorthodox way.  Lean in front of you a little, maybe.  I guess.  Maybe?  But you could say, capture.  And it makes sense.  And then your watch goes off.  Yeah, the shutter sound.  And then everyone looks at Roland like, what the fuck is this guy doing? 
[00:43:00]  What was that?  We've got to turn off the shutter sound.  How do we do that?  I don't know.  I've been looking.  I hate that in the locker room.  Lock room and upskirts, man.  It's easy.  Options.  Can you really turn that off?  Yeah.  So you could turn it.  I think it's the sound mode on options.  You turn off the watch.  On the watch or the watch?  Nice.  I'm going to.  Where is it?  I don't see it.  I didn't do it.  I was just reading about it.  Oh, gosh.  You don't even know.  Do you know how we know?  By the way, this is like a pastry place that just opened up in my neighborhood. 
[00:43:30]  One of these fancy pastry places.  They're selling the cronut.  Oh, man.  An illegal cronut.  They're calling it different.  I think they call it a cro...  You have a monofuku milk?  Croissant donut, I think they call it.  Yeah.  Crow donut?  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah, but it's like, it's so obvious.  The cronut.  It's the cronut.  That's a guy that should be suing everybody.  He's going after people.  But you should sue all of them and say, look, just because you changed the name doesn't 
[00:44:00]  mean, you know, you're safe.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, they just can't use cronut.  But somebody spelt it differently, and I think they got away with it.  Yeah, it's like the crumbs did the cronut.  Did he patent the actual recipe for the cronut?  I think he patented everything because...  Well, then he probably will make some money off that.  Yeah.  His cookbook comes out soon.  Huh?  His cookbook.  Huh?  His cookbook.  Huh?  Ah!  I heard you the first time.  I know.  I don't know how to...  I don't know how to do that silent the watch for the camera. 
[00:44:30]  I just send them an email, and then you call them, and then you go, I don't know what  to do.  Well, that's what white club's all about.  White club!  Call the people.  We have questions.  Call that guy.  Yeah.  If I'm here, I don't see if I'm going to get...  Settings.  Is it on there?  I think it might be on your watch.  Autolac.  Smart Relay.  Wake Up Gesture.  Oh.  Source Unknown.  No?  No.  No?  Nothing in just plain settings.  Oh, boy. 
[00:45:00]  I just cough real loud, and we go, ah!  Is that the workaround?  Just cough?  Another guy, we're kind of stalling, so you don't have to listen to us eat on the air.  Let's say hi to Mark in Jersey.  Mark E., what's up?  Yeah, listen, number one, I have a number of patents, and I've been in business for a  lot of years, and the one thing I've learned is that the only people who make money over  patents are lawyers, unless you have a ton of money to go sue people. 
[00:45:30]  Now, there is a place in Texas, which is, it's basically, it's near the nearest federal court  for suits, where there's a company that represents all the patent trolls.  I actually had heard about this on, there's a radio show called This American Life, I don't  know if you know what it is.  Nice plug.  Way to go.  Snuck that in.  Hold on, let me ask you, too, this suit is being, this suit is coming out of Texas. 
[00:46:00]  Right, because that's where the district court is that handles all of these lawsuits.  Someone else is saying this, hold on, someone else is saying that a lot of these are, yeah,  in Texas, because the judge will not throw these lawsuits out, and they all know that,  so they're moving, you know.  They have offices there.  Yeah, there you go.  They put their offices, and there's a guy from Microsoft, who is one of the original Microsoft  guys, who's a big owner of these patent troll things. 
[00:46:30]  He wrote some book, a cookbook, it's, he's just one of these, I call them leeches, okay,  because at the end of the day, they stop business, they don't help business.  Do you know what I mean?  They just get in the way, and they really are just trying to make money off of other  people's efforts.  And it goes on forever.  The tax attorneys are the worst.  If he's one of the, sorry, hold on, if he's one of the inventors in Microsoft, does he  know, is there a legitimacy to it? 
[00:47:00]  I'm not saying there is, I just, if he's that high up in Microsoft, you probably don't  need the money.  If you invent something and patent it or don't patent it, or patent it, and don't do anything  with the patent because you could never afford to, then five or six years later, another guy  sees the patent and says, listen, let's get together.  And they get investors together.  This guy's an investor from Microsoft.  He is not an inventor.  He's an investor, and they get investors together to sue people, basically. 
[00:47:30]  That's all their business is.  It's, you know, it really, it kind of makes me sick.  What are you going to do?  It's American.  Take some Pepto.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  And more importantly, John in New Hampshire.  John.  John.  Hello.  Yeah, John.  No, it's Eric.  The phone screen is, they can't get nothing right.  Sorry, Eric.  Hi, Eric.  Gentlemen, I hope you're having a good morning.  Listen, the reason, the camera phones, you can't turn the shutter noise off. 
[00:48:00]  They did that about two years ago.  So you can't take pictures of people, like upskirts, without them hearing that loud.  Well, yeah, for the watch, maybe.  But the phones, you can.  Yeah, you can turn it off.  My iPhone, I could.  My Samsung, I've got the Galaxy 3, and you can't.  I had to download an app to be able to do it.  How fucking annoying is that?  All right, let's download the app.  What's the app?  I don't know.  I can't think of it off.  If you just do a search for it, you'll find one.  There's a ton of them, so you can turn the sound off.  You can go, and they have stealth mode, so your phone looks like it's totally off. 
[00:48:30]  And you can take pictures.  No sound.  Look at this creep.  That's why that creep in the locker room, that's why that guy gives me the creep sitting  on his phone.  Because I know those apps exist.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking jerk-off.  Pictures of your luscious cock.  Oh, hold on.  Check this out.  Right.  Oh, you hear that?  Of course you didn't.  I just took a picture of opiate crossbow.  You son of a bitch.  It's a hot phone.  Why haven't they put the camera here yet?  On the edge.  On the edge, so you can...  The top edge. 
[00:49:00]  No, because look, and then you're looking at your phone like this, but you're actually  focusing your camera on something across...  I'm just looking.  Across from you.  That's probably why.  I'm just looking at the phone.  But why haven't...  That would be a great one for a phone company.  You'd put it right up here on the edge.  Yeah.  Because this way, it's obvious every time.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  They probably figure nice people are taking family photos.  They're not doing it for locker room trolls and upskirts.  Good point.  Thank you, Eric.  I have nothing else.  I'm punching out.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Eric. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  Peace up, E.  Joe in Michigan.  Jive turkey.  He's trying to hip up my lingo.  Yeah.  Come on, guys.  Hey.  I was...  About the patent stuff.  You guys ever seen a movie called Stroke of Genius?  I was an executive producer on that film.  You are, Jimmy.  Yes, I was.  But go ahead.  You explain it.  It's pretty cool.  It's about this guy named Robert Kearns.  He takes on all the Detroit automakers because he invented the intermittent wiper blades. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  And it gets into how it takes over his life and destroys his family.  And it takes all these years.  It just shows how he gets sucked into the legal system.  And it just takes over his entire life.  And then at the very end, it gets into how he finally gets a settlement.  But his wife...  I think he's divorced.  Flash of Genius.  And his kids not even around.  It's a pretty good movie.  It's called Flash of...  It's called Flash of Genius.  Flash of Genius.  Flash of Genius.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  It's about Detroit automakers and patents destroying the windshield wiper inventor's life. 
[00:50:30]  I would watch that.  Yeah.  I would watch that one.  Yeah.  Sounds good.  It's a pretty good movie.  He's always very indecisive.  You'd ask him a question.  And he'd put one arm up and do like the...  Ah.  Ah.  He'd put the arms up back and forth.  And he was doing that one day.  And he just thought, wow, how great would this be to get rain off of glass?  That's how it happened.  That's how it happened, yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he was actually a break dancer.  And he would put his arms up straight and then do the robot.  And then while he was doing it, he's like, oh my God.  Wow. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  I should have quit one bad joke.  Yeah.  But I went greedy.  I figured I had a home run.  You're greedy.  I like to throw ours in there.  Keeps everybody aggressing.  Tristan in Florida.  Tristan.  Yeah, I've got a Galaxy S4.  And to turn off the shutter noise for the camera, I didn't have to download an app or anything.  If I just turn the phone volume all the way down to vibrate, it shuts off the shutter noise.  Oh, wow.  Try that.  It was just awfully loud.  What was that?  He shut down the volume and put it on vibrate. 
[00:51:30]  Well, that's for the phone.  What do you mean?  Yeah, it turns off all the other noises on the phone.  Allegedly.  But the phone, we're talking about the watch.  Yeah, but...  I don't give a shit about the phone.  I'm talking about the watch going...  You just got to cough.  All right, then.  All right, then.  I'm with you, sir.  And I have an iPhone.  Oh, okay.  Put your thumb on the speaker.  Wait.  Oh, wait.  Let's see if this works.  YouTube rules how to take the shutter sound off on Galaxy Gear. 
[00:52:00]  It's on YouTube as a video.  All right.  What did we say?  Shoot?  Capture.  Oh.  Capture.  Go ahead!  Oh.  Oh.  Did that work?  I don't know.  Probably not.  Wait.  You were just...  I think my battery died.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  I think my battery died on my watch.  Oh, God.  You're not plugging in, motherfucker.  What happened?  No, let me see.  White glow.  Capture. 
[00:52:30]  Capture.  That's great.  Take a picture, motherfucker.  Do you know how crazy you'd look if you were doing that in 1955, just talking to your watch?  Do you have it on camera?  He says, say, swipe.  Swipe.  Hold on.  Swipe to the camera.  Yeah.  Swipe down.  Yeah, I got camera.  Oh, down.  Swipe down.  Right?  Swiping down.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Battery's low.  I know.  I know the battery's low.  Did you get the camera up?  No.  Oh.  It's a cheese.  Battery's low.  I know.  I don't care.  Battery's low.  God damn it won't let me do anything.  Why? 
[00:53:00]  Your battery's low.  The battery's too low.  Do you have your charger here, Roland?  I don't.  White glove.  Get the white glove, people.  We need a new charger.  Damn it.  It was funny that you said I had a latex glove.  Oh, wait.  I got my watch somewhere.  Yeah, you could try it.  I like fingers in my butt.  Hold on.  Let me try it.  That would be amazing if that's...  If that's as simple as it is.  All right.  Maybe I could control it by the phone, though.  Oh.  What do you say?  Gear.  How do you...  Gear. 
[00:53:30]  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Oh, we suck.  You got it?  Yeah, but I can't figure out how to get my...  Oh, there.  Okay.  Okay, let's see.  All right, so what do I do?  You cover that with your thumb, that speaker on the very bottom.  This thing?  Yeah.  Okay.  Cover your finger.  I'm looking at it.  Capture.  Son of a bitch!  Upskirts!  Yeah.  I heard it, though.  Easy enough.  What did you hear?  I heard the click. 
[00:54:00]  No.  Yes, I did.  Let me see.  Do it again.  Put it by the mic.  Yeah, put it by the mic.  All right, I'll put it by the mic.  It might be a slight.  Right.  Yeah.  Instead of...  Let me hear.  Okay.  Capture.  Very slight.  You would never hear that.  Jimmy went...  Yeah, I did it first.  I actually did hear it on that, though.  Well, I had it right on the microphone.  You would never hear that.  No, you wouldn't.  I have great ears, though.  Oh.  It's what between...  It's what between... 
[00:54:30]  It's what between.  Oh, no.  I should fucking...  I should sue the fucking voice box.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  I was trying to see the pathway from my brain to my vocal cords, and I couldn't say it.  You can't talk.  I love it.  I really don't.  I'm having a four-hour stroke today.  It's a long one.  It's a very slow one.  Oh, food soon.  Holy shit.  Glenn in Santa Barbara.  Glenn.  All the way out there in Santa Barbara.  This is pretty cool.  What do you got, Glenn? 
[00:55:00]  My Samsung Galaxy S4, you just go into camera.  Camera settings.  Turn off the shutter sound.  We know.  We heard that already.  But how do you do that?  Exactly.  Is it really...  Yes.  Yeah, I think it's in the camera settings.  All right.  I'm going to look.  Go into settings.  Go into settings.  Find shutter sound.  There's an on-off switch.  No, it's not here.  Not on the new phone.  Not on the new phone.  Oh, wait, wait.  Okay.  Hold on.  Shutter.  I'm actually suing them because I invented the on-off switch and camera noises. 
[00:55:30]  Shutter sound.  There you go.  All right.  Good.  Because I'm going to use my phone way more than my watch to take pictures.  Where did you find that?  I'm not telling you.  It's in a camera.  White glove.  It's in a camera settings.  Oh, man.  All right, sir.  Super simple.  You're panicking.  Camera.  Go to the settings.  Camera.  And then go to the settings.  Settings.  And then do the settings thing again.  I don't see.  In the upper right corner.  Oh, shit.  They keep going down.  I see you.  Oh, snap.  Wait.  Upskirts.  Wait, I don't have- 
[00:56:00]  Back in business.  You want me to do it?  Reset.  Where?  Volume key.  It's there.  It's there.  Let me see.  Camera.  First shot.  Photo size.  I don't have it.  Let me see.  No.  Let me see.  I suck at technology.  I'm going to completely acknowledge, but to be able to help you would be pretty awesome  because I suck at this stuff.  Oh, my God.  Where?  Settings.  Settings. 
[00:56:30]  What the fuck?  I don't have it.  Wait a minute.  Update your phone.  Update your phone.  Update your phone.  I did last night.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Smart stabilizer.  Maybe you shouldn't have updated your phone.  Holy shit.  Wait, Ann's not lying.  I don't have one.  What?  What?  Wait a minute.  Holy shit.  Hello.  Let me see yours.  I'll show you where mine is.  Let me see where yours is.  Go to the camera.  Are we still on the radio?  Yeah, we do.  Here we go.  Apparently. 
[00:57:00]  Settings.  Settings.  Settings.  Settings.  All the way down.  All the way down.  Shutter sound.  Nothing.  You don't have that?  That's so weird.  Oh, they gave you a crappy phone.  They gave me one, but I can't take a secret.  You should have been suspicious when the time wasn't right.  I know.  White glove, Roland.  Call the white glove people.  We got issues.  What is a holding company?  Yes.  Can someone answer me that?  I'm reading an interview by Jim Logan, and he actually talked to a lot of these people 
[00:57:30]  who are going after him, calling him a patent troll, and he actually answered some questions.  And they said, what exactly does your company do?  And he said, Personal Audio LLC is a holding company.  That is, we own property, and our main activities relate to earning a return on that property.  To me, that sounds like earning a return on that property is a way to say lawsuits, but  am I reading that wrong?  What is a holding company?  A holding company is a company or a firm that owns other companies' outstanding stock.  Oh.  It's like what this company did with Sirius when they kind of... 
[00:58:00]  Did their thing.  Did their thing, yes.  So they don't really create anything, they just own the...  No, it's like a parent company that just buys up large amounts of stock.  Right.  And then earn a return on that property.  Correct.  Earn a return.  And how do you earn the return?  Through litigation.  Is that what he's saying?  The company could make money.  If you're a holding company that is holding a company that actually makes money.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't think it necessarily means that they're all just suing people.  No, no, no.  I don't mean all of them. 
[00:58:30]  I mean, is that in this case what it is?  How would he earn the return on his...  Yeah, it sounds pretty reasonable.  All right.  Let's take a break, eat some food.  Jay Moore's is coming in today.  Oh, yeah?  Also known as Jay Moore.  And also Mindy...  Some Mindy lady's coming in there.  Yeah, Mindy Kelly.  Is it Kayling or Kelly?  Your mom's box.  Kayling.  What the hell?  Mindy Kelly.  When you have fun.  And Mindy, how do you say it?  Mindy Kayling.  Kayling.  Everyone's very excited around here that Mindy's coming in.  Yeah, she's really...  I was going to say really very popular, but who cares if I said she's popular? 
[00:59:00]  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  She is popular.  She's a very popular girl.  Why would I give a 90-year-old woman's...  I don't know.  She's doing the Mindy Project on Fox.  Yeah.  And she was on The Office.  You know the girl.  Mm-hmm.  She's, yeah.  She's very funny and very famous.  People are very excited today.  Yep.  All right.  Oh, no kidding. 
[00:59:30]  On this date, 28 years ago.  28 years.  Wow.  28 years ago.  Oh, my God.  Sammy Hagar played his first show as lead singer of Van Halen.  Jesus Christ.  28 years ago.  Ah.  That was the start of Van Hagar.  I do remember that.  28 years ago?  Yeah.  And the arguments started up. 
[01:00:00]  Who is the better singer?  Yeah.  They haven't stopped.  Sammy or Dave or Tetley.  Mm.  I like them all.  But I go with David Lee Roth over Sammy Hagar.  Well, for the tunes.  Although, you know, Sammy Hagar had some monster songs with Van Halen.  Big hits.  Yeah, but David Lee Roth is much better.  It's a Van Halen front man, though.  We've got to get him in.  And a front man, that's for sure.  I'll give the voice to Sammy.  But, uh.  Yeah.  We love David Lee Roth.  Let's get him back in. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Have you forgotten already?  I think I missed that day.  Wasn't it you guys and David Lee Roth?  No, I missed that day, too.  Really?  It was me and David Lee Roth and Sam.  I think we saddled Sam and Jimmy with him.  Anderson Silva came in.  I forget who else came in.  Yeah.  Did you guys get a word in?  No.  He didn't say much during the Anderson interview.  And then, uh, Mick Jagger's, uh, Broad there. 
[01:01:00]  Well, jeez.  What a just horrible, tragic story.  That Broad, horribly tragic.  I don't know her name.  Elren?  Lorren.  Lorren?  I think her real name is Laura or Lauren.  She changed it.  I'm going to say Lauren, but it's Lorren.  But she spells it L-  Apostrophe W-  R-E-N or something.  So that's why I went with the L-R-E-N.  But, uh, obviously, yeah.  Lorren.  Yeah.  She left her nine million dollars.  I thought she was broke.  I think it's eight million.  I would love to be broke with nine million dollars.  Can I have a spoon?  I think her company was floundering, but, uh, she had some cake left. 
[01:01:30]  I think it was an eight million dollar apartment.  Condo.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's got, you know, property.  But, uh...  And she left it all to Mick Jagger, so the paper has to say, rolling in the dough on the front  cover.  Nine million...  What?  It's rolling stone.  No, I understand why they're using the word rolling, but my point is that he's not rolling  in the dough because he just made nine million dollars.  That's nothing to Mick Jagger.  So to say rolling in the dough like he just became, you know, extremely rich off this thing. 
[01:02:00]  He had that cash.  Oh, God.  Nine million dollars to Mick Jagger, I would have to think is like a hundred dollars.  It's a joke.  Yeah.  He's got to be a billionaire by this point.  And she purposely left the family out because it says she mentioned, and unless otherwise  stated, I am like, she said, I'm not leaving anything to my living heirs.  So there was a whole motherfuck to the family there.  That was not a mistake.  That is a motherfuck.  Yeah.  Good.  Good for her.  Yeah, but who knows what they're like.  And the family said that they want certain things. 
[01:02:30]  I don't even know if they want money, but certain things that have been in the family  that belong to the mom or whatever.  Maybe Mick will just give it to him.  I just have a problem with the headline, stupid.  He's not rolling in the dough over nine million dollars.  More cheeky fucking newspaper.  Do we have any update on Sam?  He just left without saying anything.  He must be really sick.  Yeah.  Because he didn't even tell us he was leaving.  Because that's how he makes us feel.  Sam doesn't take sick days.  No.  Ever.  No.  He just sloughs off here.  Right.  But he's probably puking or something.  How did he sound on the pre-show? 
[01:03:00]  Untalented.  He sounded not as energetic, I will admit.  Oh, really?  I'll admit he has food poisoning or something.  There's nothing going around that I know.  What am I fucking yapping about?  How much food poisoning goes on in this goddamn...  Not a lot.  Not much.  Jesus.  But I mean, when you leave after doing that, he probably just got hit with something.  Especially Sam, because he never takes sick days.  No.  Yeah.  He doesn't even take all his personal days for the year.  No, he's got to be here. 
[01:03:30]  He's got 20 shows to do.  A lot of us don't end up using all of them.  What if he's got some WWE meeting that he had to be, too?  And he's just like, oh, I got to go.  And he's just like, oh, I got to go.  He might need to be in Bristol and like...  Right, right.  That's why he didn't say goodbye.  Because we're really good at this shit.  We'd be like, you don't look sick.  Oh, Sam.  Who called Sam?  Sex Bagel.  Sam?  Yeah.  Why didn't you say goodbye to us?  Oh, Sam.  You were doing a radio show. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, I don't like that.  You're not going to poke your head in, though.  Like you do.  What am I...  Yeah, but I'm not just going to poke my head in in the middle of the show and be like,  hey, ladies and gentlemen, Sam is going to leave the building.  He would have known...  He knows we would have kept him like another hour.  What's wrong?  He'd have been on the air.  Yeah.  What do you got?  You got boo-boo?  I got the foot, yeah.  Boo-boo tummy?  Achies?  Achies.  Are you like, you know...  Are you at your mommy's house?  No, I'm at my apartment.  Is mommy rubbing Vink's on your chest right now? 
[01:04:30]  An anus.  It's morning.  An anus.  Jesus.  So did you vomit?  No, not yet, but I'm not convinced that I won't be doing that.  If it's a flu, is it like a cold, cough flu?  Yeah, it's like a sore throat and achies.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the achies.  What about the poops?  What do you got?  Any shit?  No, the poops are fine right now.  Still solid as a rock.  Solid as a rock. 
[01:05:00]  I would always have soap when I didn't feel good.  A little soup.  Have some chicken noodle soup.  There's a strong rumor going around that you're on the drugs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, no, I'm not on drugs.  Yes.  It's a strong...  Easy tea.  It's a very strong rumor.  Yeah.  I'd like to squash that rumor.  Who started that rumor?  Oh, we did.  Somebody.  It was like that you're rising star is rising a little too fast and, you know, you're one 
[01:05:30]  of those people that couldn't handle it, so you started doing the drugs.  Right.  That's the rumor.  That we started immediately.  That we started.  Immediately as you're walking down the hall.  Yeah.  I weren't even out of the building yet.  Right.  So deal with that on Twitter today, because people are going to be very concerned about  your drug problems.  And then the other thing that we suspect is that you're not sick at all, but you had  a meeting set up with WWE, and you couldn't change the time, so you have to leave the show  to meet with them.  Right.  No, if I had a meeting with WWE, I wouldn't have even showed up today. 
[01:06:00]  Ah, smart.  Get all fancy and gussied up.  Yeah, I would have gotten well rested.  Yeah.  All right, well...  I commend you for not putting on the sick voice.  Yeah, that's some bullshit.  Like E-Rock does.  E-Rock does the good sick voice.  Oh, yeah, I'm not feeling too good.  Oh, I don't feel good.  I love that one.  We took some shots at E-Rock off air today.  Yeah.  No, you did. 
[01:06:30]  To make it really hurt.  It wasn't we.  Well, the fire alarms were going off, and I go, hey, man, does anyone know where the  stairs are around here?  And E-Rock said, no.  And I said, of course you don't know where the stairs are.  He's implying he's so fat.  And then I forgot that we weren't on the air, so it really made it hurt.  Yeah.  The mic wasn't even in front of his face.  Because we've always claimed, ah, come on, dude, we're just doing it for the show.  The mics are on.  Just the show.  It was an obesity joke.  Obesity.  All right, Sam, I hope you feel better.  Thank you for your concern. 
[01:07:00]  Is your wife nursing you to health, or did she go to work?  She's about to go to work right now.  What'd she do for you?  She's happy.  She got me some saltines.  Did she hook you up?  I love saltines.  Oh, God, I love saltines.  Saltines.  It's pretty good.  Good saltines.  What do you eat on them?  Did she give a little rubbing on your fever bag?  Did she rub you a smelly little Christmas Santa's bag?  Just hanging on your leg?  Nothing in there?  Nothing better than a warm fever bag, though.  Fever bag. 
[01:07:30]  As you're laying in your pajamas, and you feel the warmness.  Balls are trying to keep that fucking two degree temperature difference.  Just dangling down as low as they can.  You've got to peel it off your upper thigh.  Oh, it's like fucking, like you put too much hubba bubble in your mouth, and then just slapped it on your thigh.  That's rules.  We could all take tomorrow off, because we're going to get what you got.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, I will say the show is sounding great today, as always.  I know.  Yeah.  Don't you miss a beat with you?  I am. 
[01:08:00]  Are you working from home?  You're monitoring from home?  Oh, yeah, I'll be working from home today.  Oh, wow.  All right, Sammy.  Hey, instead of the flu, tell everybody you got the drove.  Sorry you had to deal with that on your sick day.  Why?  It's just a big laugh.  It's the way to end it.  I'm a little sicker.  All right, Sam.  All right, thanks.  Thank you, thank you, Sam.  There you go, Sam.  I can't wait until he's fucking dry heaving and vomiting little saltine balls like a cat.  You're still on the line.  Good, Sam.  I can't wait until you're dry heaving and vomiting little saltine balls like a cat. 
[01:08:30]  Bruiser Brody sees that giant fucking fever bag and doesn't know what it is.  Oh, man.  And he starts scratching at it with his fat cat claws.  Sam fucking lays four nasty little hooks into it.  Yeah.  Oh, is that great?  He has no idea.  He thinks it's fucking catnip.  Pulls down on it.  You can't get him off.  You're running around the fucking house.  No, he's got, like, because Sam's on his hands and he's vomiting with his dumb, feety PJs.  Oh, yes.  So the cat gets on his back and, like, and then does that thing where he digs, he scraps 
[01:09:00]  it with the back.  With his back feet?  Yeah.  He's doing the shk, shk, shk, shk, shk, shk.  Yeah.  Angrily scratching Sam's bag.  Sam, comment?  All right, no.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  That's all we needed.  All right, later.  There goes Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm glad he didn't get us sick, though.  I appreciate that he didn't stick around and get us sick.  Yeah, you totally avoid us.  That's good.  You get Travis sick.  Travis is using his microphone.  They made out, too.  That's true.  Did you lie, Saul, that motherfucker?  No.  I didn't know that he was sick. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, boy.  Until he left.  Oh, well.  So you're right on that, Mike.  Yeah.  I'm definitely not coming in tomorrow.  That's good.  Well, that's good, yeah.  All right.  For the foreseeable future.  Sam didn't even try to sound sick, really.  No, he didn't want to fuck.  He's not sick.  He's not even home.  He's pretending he eats saltines.  I think you're right.  Here's that app on your thing.  That new phone.  Sounds sick.  It's a saltines app.  Where you press the phone, it sounds like a crunch of crackers.  You're chewing crackers.  Yeah.  I'm glad I got that one out.  The one joke I delivered perfectly, bombs.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  At least you said it. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, it's our pal.  The Mount Everest guy is on MSNBC right now.  Oh, cool.  They showed that wingsuit and everything.  My God.  There was something young Evil Knievel looking about him.  Yes.  Wasn't there?  Yes.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Like the hair and everything.  He left right away.  Did we?  I don't think we annoyed him.  Okay.  No, he was great.  Very busy.  They were very happy with your interview.  Oh, good.  Good.  And he was on Fallon last night, too.  Oh, he was?  Yeah.  He was tweeting all sorts of pictures of him and fell.  Yeah, he was a very nice dude.  Did you see the video I tweeted? 
[01:10:30]  No.  About the dead bodies on Everest?  Oh, I thought it was the one that was more horrific.  Oh, the other one.  The real rock TV.  Oh, well, we don't have to bring that up.  Why?  Oh, is that a good one?  It's not on my channel.  I want to see that.  Those are just dead funny bones.  No, no, no.  I did release.  It's part of the Douche Chill collection.  The Douche Chill collection.  The second video this week I put up on my YouTube channel.  Wow.  I'll tweet it again this morning, but it's me and Ant.  Partying and pranking is what I named it.  That was hilarious. 
[01:11:00]  Wait, what is this one?  This is not the one we showed yesterday?  No, I'm doing one a day for the rest of the week.  The beach one, I think I'll get done today.  This has one of my favorite lines that you've ever delivered.  I haven't seen this.  Well, hold on.  It needs a little setup.  I mean, the brilliance of this.  Hope he's looking right into the camera.  Well, because, you know, we're going live here, and all of a sudden we're looking at  the camera like, what the fuck?  You know, we could see the people looking at us.  See, we're ahead of our time.  Now a lot of people have done this particular bit. 
[01:11:30]  Sure.  We're doing like, we can see who's watching us.  Right.  You know.  Right.  I can't do this today.  Well, I've got it.  I'm usually the one that has no problem with this shit.  Yesterday wasn't bad, dude.  This wasn't so good.  No, I can't do this.  Just go watch the video.  I haven't seen it.  My computer's broken at all.  I can't do this in front of journal.  I can't get the internet.  Yesterday, I liked it more than I thought I would.  I thought yesterday. 
[01:12:00]  Sixteen years ago.  Yesterday wasn't bad.  Did you see a red?  I hope he's red.  Oh, wow.  Yesterday was not bad.  I was trying to rub my face off.  I thought yesterday was going to be terrible.  It was amazing, but it was okay.  It was all right for the time.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I wanted it to be.  You live and learn.  The hair.  What's wrong with the hair?  Wait till you see the ski hat.  All right.  Well, go back.  It's so good.  How long is this?  Minute 30.  Minute 30?  Oh, come on.  You can do that.  Stand it on your head.  Okay. 
[01:12:30]  Dude, there's people watching us there.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, put that away.  That's disgusting.  Funny, right?  Oh, my God.  Wait.  That guy's getting like moping that chick on his mom's couch.  That guy is toasting English muffins with no clothes on.  Look at that.  Why would he do that?  Can you pause?  What?  Why do we have to pause?  Hi, Jimmy.  I just don't like that he's toasting English muffins.  Why would he do that?  But even why is that so outrageous? 
[01:13:00]  There's a naked guy having breakfast in his own home.  I don't know why.  What makes these videos great is the confidence.  We had no doubt we were going to be fucking huge radio stars.  We were nobodies at this point.  This is terrible.  Well, you're just kind of leaning in, figuring out what people are doing.  All right.  More.  Look at that.  Fuck.  That's putrid.  All right.  All right.  My favorite part right there is they both ran out of stuff people are doing.  Yes.  So they look the other way. 
[01:13:30]  Exactly.  And now the real bit.  Oh, that was?  Oh, no.  Sunday River.  Maine.  Maine.  Opie and Anthony, it says on the screen.  In a condo.  We actually, a lot of the guys in the radio station, we all went up to Sunday River to ski.  I remember that being a really good time.  That was fun.  But it was a pain in the ass to get to.  Remember?  It was like you had to be on a country road for over 100 miles or something.  Ice and it was crazy.  Oh, it took forever to get there.  But when we were finally there, we had a blast.  How long did you stay for? 
[01:14:00]  I don't know.  10 minutes.  Probably.  I mean, probably a night.  Yeah.  I mean.  I think it was a.  Two nights maybe.  A couple of nights.  Yeah.  But, so, I'm with my wonderful ex-wife, by the way.  Yeah, you get a glimpse of her back, I think.  I don't know.  Something.  Because someone's asking, are you sleeping with a chick or a Jew?  What do you think?  Exactly.  You want to do it, Alex?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me talk to him.  Let me talk to him.  Hi, Alex.  Hey, what's up, fellas? 
[01:14:30]  What's up, man?  Hey, I've been a long time listening since the fucking NEW days and when you guys came  to WJSK in D.C.  Yeah.  But last night watching this video, I'm like, fucking douchebags.  And then Opie implies that you're gay, so he fucking walks in the bedroom and you wake  up and you fucking look like you're going to kill him, but you see a body of...  You just...  What are you doing?  You're ruining the whole bit!  Sorry.  Why would you...  Oh, my Lord.  Why would you think...  Why would you even think for a second that it's a guy? 
[01:15:00]  Really?  Really.  You got that look like when you guys...  When fucking Baba Ray Dalby was at your studio at WJSK and he was asking, what the fuck  is the string hanging from the chick's pussy?  Remember that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know where he's going.  I have no idea.  All right.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thank you for listening.  You're messing up everything.  You're ruining everything.  You really are ruining everything.  You're ruining our lives.  All right.  So here you go, Jimmy.  Enjoy.  Hey, Real Rock TV. 
[01:15:30]  What's happening, man?  It's Opie.  We're up here skiing in Maine.  Having a great time.  Pause for one second.  I just...  I'm uncomfortable because Opie's chilling out on the couch.  Chilling being the right word.  Yeah.  Kind of laying back, but like with legs up on the couch, hand propped up on the leg and  wearing like a flannel and some shades and a backwards hat.  Just a young, cool guy just chilling.  Chilling.  Well, no, why?  Because we had a rough night of partying.  I guess you're about to sing.  Oh, you're about to sing.  And you missed the cup of coffee.  I'm just chilling after a... 
[01:16:00]  Just chilling.  A very long night of partying.  This is my favorite line coming up.  Oh, boy.  Hey, what's happening, man?  It's Opie.  We're up here skiing in Maine.  Having a great time.  We had one hell of a party last night.  Check out the empties, man.  That's it.  Check out the empties, man.  And there's the most staged fucking beer cans and bottles neatly.  It's like a store shelf.  Look, it was an OCD party, all right?  And there's only like 12 beers on the table. 
[01:16:30]  Check out the empties, man.  Check out the empties, man.  You missed...  All right, well...  Let's go back.  We'll catch it.  I love that.  Hey, laugh all you want, but when I sell a shitload of check out the empties, man, t-shirts...  I might even buy that one.  All right.  But I spell man a little weird.  M-A-H-N, yeah.  A couple A's in there as well.  Check out the empties, man.  Man.  In Maine, having a great time.  We had one hell of a party last night.  Check out the empties, man.  Can you pause again?  What makes that shot so great, too?  Ian is making it look like Ian was the camera guy, the producer. 
[01:17:00]  It's crazy.  Oh, look at that.  He's moving the camera from side to side.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at all these empties.  It was a party.  Guaranteed, those were in the garbage.  Those cans and bottles were in the garbage.  Like, because we were just being...  Just drinking beers and putting them in the garbage.  You know, I can bet what else would be fucking empties any condoms you guys want to put on.  Check out the empties, man.  Everyone is picking up on the loved all the empty cans on the table from the night of partying. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, I got a question for you.  Have you been wondering if, I don't know, Anthony's gay?  What?  Valid question.  No.  I don't even know why I needed to say that to do the bit I'm about to do.  I know.  It's the stupidest setup ever.  It just went, wake up Anthony.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm wondering if, I don't know, Anthony's gay.  You have, huh?  Let's go find out.  Oh.  Shall we?  Come with me, man.  Come with me, man.  That's a crazy ass. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, cook my omelet.  Who are you saying cook my omelet to?  Come on, Steve.  Oh, it's out.  You suck at this.  Who are you saying cook my omelet to?  Hey, cook my omelet.  And I like the fact that you're like a young party animal and you say, shall we?  Shall we?  What young party guy says, shall we?  Shall we?  Yes.  Let's go investigate.  Shall we?  I don't know why I would say cook my omelet.  We had quite the soiree last night.  Yes.  Jeeves spilled a little avocado on Anthony's jacket.  They gave us a condo for two days. 
[01:18:30]  So those 12 beers were for like, we both had girls, believe it or not, there.  Yeah.  And then I think there were other people.  There were other people.  They should have been fucking.  I think we had three or four bedrooms, I think.  There should have been a lot more bottles for a big heavy duty party.  Instead of 12 neatly put on the coffee table.  Check out the empties, man.  Come on.  I'll tweet this video.  But go ahead.  For Jimmy's pleasure.  Come with me, man.  Man.  Oh, he said man again.  Hey, cook my omelet.  I'm going to take you into Anthony's bedroom. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  Ooh.  That hat really bothers me.  You really welcome?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just fucking crashed out.  Oh my God.  You look like every guy from the Cali cartel.  That they fucking brought into custody. 
[01:19:30]  This is how they got Osama.  Yes, Anthony's on top of the compound.  We've been drone filming him.  Yes.  It's, uh, yeah.  He's out cold from the night of partying.  Oh my God.  Can we see that again?  I want to see Anthony.  I've never seen Anthony wake up.  Oh, it was terrible.  I'm like, why am I...  He's hiding under the...  I think he's pissed. 
[01:20:00]  I think we have on camera the first time you were mad at me, by the way.  I don't know.  Is that...  I would assume so.  I was just flustered.  Right.  And you're in...  I mean, you barely see the X.  The X.  But you're in bed with the X.  Yeah.  That's the X right there.  There you go, Jimmy.  You get a glimpse at her back.  I think...  I think the problem was, back then, we needed, like, just a good editor.  Because, like, if you just...  Just...  If you just went to the wake up, that would have been all right. 
[01:20:30]  Then it's fine.  But then it's all the other dumb shit.  Yeah.  If it was a really good editor, you would have heard...  There you go.  Yeah.  Not as bad as...  I'll tweet that video, too.  I just love that fucking...  Picking up girls on the beach.  That one...  That one's going to be rough.  This is a little fun moments in here.  Like, a man in the hat, but it's not, like, some horrendous bit.  I don't know why I did that back then. 
[01:21:00]  I have no idea.  I have an idea.  Check out the empties, Matt.  We were scared shitless that people would realize how old we actually were.  Oh, boy.  And it was a very young radio station we had to perform for.  Oh, boy.  So, I think that's the reason for a lot of that lingo.  Now I do it as a goof, but back then I meant it.  I hate to admit that, but I meant it.  All right.  Wow, it's cold.  Huh?  Fucking 21 degrees out.  I'm tired of it already. 
[01:21:30]  Lacey's 18 degrees.  I got 35.  Oh, let me check.  I got 35 degrees.  I got 23.  You're kidding.  23 out on Long Island.  That's where my watch...  Why does this mine say 35 degrees in New York?  I don't know.  I'm hearing the Big Apple.  Is it?  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Can you look up the temperature in New York City South?  Oh, shit.  Let's see the weather channel.  iPhone says 25 degrees currently.  My watch better, but we got all kinds of different temperatures on here.  Degrees on the weather channel.  What?  The weather one.  Oh, we got all...  Maybe yours is giving you a projected... 
[01:22:00]  And hold on.  No, because it's supposed to go up to 44 today.  I see.  I heard that that was changed.  No, I didn't hear it.  How did yours say 25?  It might say 21.  What are you sitting in the fucking fridge?  Mine says 23.  Mine says 35.  Oh, man.  We're all fucked up here.  No.  What the...  35 going up to 58.  That's your...  You're not in...  That's Friday.  Where am I?  I don't know.  You're in the wrong day.  Oh, man.  Got my hopes up.  Wait.  Sunday?  22?  What?  What the fudge?  What day is today? 
[01:22:30]  What city are you in?  Today's Thursday.  I know, because I'm doing red-eye.  Oh, sure.  Well, now it says 22, but when I go back to this, it says 22.  I don't know what just happened.  I'm partying last night, man.  I finally got the answers, man.  It's 22.  It's almost April.  Enough.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck's going on?  I'm tired of it.  Did you see Kim Jong?  I love that he did that extra.  It is pretty hilarious.  Wouldn't you want everyone to have, like, your... 
[01:23:00]  Well, my old haircut?  How great would that be?  I forced everyone to have my old haircut.  The Prince Valiant.  Right.  You like this, right, Jimmy?  What's that?  Oh, God, yeah.  The hairdo?  He rules.  So, basically, Kim Jong-un is making all the males have the exact same haircut as him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He is a dictator.  Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, in a bizarre bit of tyranny there, decreed that his 12 million 
[01:23:30]  countrymen adopt his decidedly retro high-end type do.  He likes that shaped side of the head.  Good shit.  He delivered his fashion guideline about two weeks ago.  I am.  Likely ensuring that Dennis Rodman and his multi-hued mop will never return to the nation.  What does that mean?  Hey, they're trying to be funny.  Why are they working that into the story?  Because that's the story everyone remembers. 
[01:24:00]  The oon and only haircut, get it?  Oon and only.  Jay!  It's Jay Mois.  What are you doing?  You want to know?  Yeah.  This one?  No.  It's kick Sal out.  I was going to wait.  I was supposed to come on 815, but when you guys were going around and around about the  fucking weather, I decided to be jumping to the pool.  You didn't have to happen.  Jesus Christ.  How long are you on the air?  A day?  Well, we'd like to know.  I mean, Jay, it's a concern here.  I'd like to know.  People are sick and dying.  Weather breaks happen all the time on the radio. 
[01:24:30]  We wish we could do an hour podcast a week.  It would be so easy.  Holy shanky.  We've got to fill up 20 hours a week.  He was fucking rolling.  Showing me pictures of donuts on the internet.  He'll do that.  You know, people wait in line four hours to get this donut.  I'm like, that's great.  It's a cronut.  What do you need a sponsor, Pepper?  What do you need?  You haven't had the cronut yet?  The cronut?  Yeah.  I wouldn't wait four hours for a blowjob wrapped in a donut.  Bite into the blowjob donut.  They shouldn't.  I'd work that one out.  They shouldn't make people wait for blowjobs.  That would be funny.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, you're right.  We do have to wait for blowjobs.  Every time we take a girl to dinner, that's all that is.  That's what dinner should be called.  It's a placeholder for head.  I fucking take them out and they make you wait.  We're looking at this.  We're looking at this.  He looks like when they drop hair on the big downsy monster on Bugs Bunny.  That crazy monster with one, two.  Monsters are interesting people.  Rinsley's.  No, we knew the name.  What's the name of that?  Gossamer.  Gossamer, thank you.  I don't know why. 
[01:25:30]  We bring that up again once in a while.  They never really say it in the episodes.  They just, yeah.  Monsters.  Is that his name, Gossamer?  Yeah.  And he's wearing Chuck Taylors.  You ever notice that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, very nicely tied.  Yeah, nice Chuck Taylors.  Rins, please.  Yeah, Rins, please.  I got 27.  I got 22.  Mine says 23.  Up to 25.  And I looked at Roland.  I go, what the fuck is happening?  Why am I in a dark room with Roland?  We were about to go to break, that's why. 
[01:26:00]  We had a problem with our technology.  It wasn't so much a weather break as why are we getting different answers as to what the temperature is.  Maybe it's a little cooler on Opie's side than it is on your side.  Well, that probably wouldn't work.  You're carrying around a fucking Etch-A-Sketch.  The thing's huge.  What the fuck?  This is the Galaxy Note 3.  I know.  We got him yesterday.  This is the white glove phone.  We got him yesterday.  Look, and show him the watch. 
[01:26:30]  I got this.  I use that all the time.  Oh, look out.  Look at this, huh?  That's the one that works in concerto with the phone.  All right.  Don't work blue.  Are you worried about this?  We were talking about this thing that guys fucking went at the Corolla.  This podcast guy.  Well, here's the thing.  If the guy wins, every podcast gets off the air and the guy will be murdered.  That's true.  Like, it's not just Corolla, me, you guys.  You know, first of all, Rogan alone will fucking tap this guy out, right? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  But then, like, all your TV shows, every radio show on the planet, gone.  Every episodic form of entertainment.  No, not radio shows.  Isn't it only episodic online?  Jimmy, please.  Anthony, what were you saying?  I just think so.  Well, I'm just trying to clarify, because Anthony's painting with broad legal brushes, and I...  No, I mean, how do you...  I don't think so.  I don't think it'll wash.  I'm more...  I want to know how Mick Jagger winds up with $9 million in his pocket when her girlfriend dies. 
[01:27:30]  Well, she didn't like her family.  She liked Mick.  She didn't like her family.  Family never fucking sang Painted Black.  That could be fucked them.  That's why she hated them, because they would always sing it.  That could be the most impressive thing he's ever done.  Gets $9 million.  How long are they going out?  A while, yes.  Two weeks.  Sometimes more than that, Jimmy.  13 years.  I was going to say at least 10.  You know what?  It's not that much money.  So, do you want to know about the watch?  Yeah.  Watch this. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Let's see.  It's what I'm doing.  Bump.  Bump.  Bump.  Capture.  No!  James Bond.  James fucking Bond.  James fucking wristwatch, man.  Fuck yeah.  Wait till I do some upskirting.  Bro.  Seriously?  That's going to be rough.  Seriously, bro?  It's the fucking future, man.  Upskirting with the watch is probably not a good idea.  No, it's called a fisting.  You can get caught.  You can take a picture of a frowning face as you're driving a fisting.  Every guy I fucking grew up with, man. 
[01:28:30]  Nice, right?  Red solo car.  Four dollars.  Yeah.  Nice.  Fucking take a picture with the watch.  I'll be bored.  You're right in a fucking clay, right?  Hey!  That's great.  I'll be right back for you.  Oh, yeah.  Andrew Dice Droopy Dog.  We'll do that later, man.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds good.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  So, that's what we're doing.  We got the Kim Jong-un.  The whole fucking country has to get that.  He should make the women do it, too.  Oh, that'd be beautiful.  Yeah, that is a bad haircut.  That's like old school. 
[01:29:00]  It's horrible.  Is that old school like old, old 30s old school?  Or is that old school like 80s?  I'm trying to say this was popularized by the boy band, but that's not true.  No boy band had this haircut.  It's a weird look because it's super awful, but then, like, if you're in a movie or a  TV show, like, in the 20s or 30s, that's how everybody's hair is.  Yeah, like the Shemp hair.  Right, right.  Boardwalk Empire.  Boardwalk Empire hair, right.  He looks like, uh, I don't want to say the name.  God damn it.  Fucking Jimmy.  No, but I know the guy's name.  I just didn't want to say it because Ann hasn't gotten there yet. 
[01:29:30]  So I actually added it.  This is watching Boardwalk Empire.  I am.  Thank you.  Am I right or wrong?  Yeah, thank you.  The guy with half a fucking face.  Oh, I know the half a face guy.  The fucking half a face guy.  The fucking guy with half a face guy.  Fucking guy with half a face, man.  He's pretty cool.  I hate the smell on that mask.  Oh, God.  Imagine what that mask, the underside of that mask smells like.  Fucking pussy and booze, man.  Imagine eating lentil soup out of that mask.  Fuck on TV, right?  Oh, fuck.  You don't give a fuck, Hope.  That fucking guy.  Probably fucking Brookdale Park right now, just driving around. 
[01:30:00]  Possibly.  You guys know me, right?  Hold on.  Let me put on the mask.  Now you know me.  Jay, I saw a movie that was, it wasn't the best movie, but you were fucking hilarious.  Oh, my, what?  That fucking, my entire IMDb page is fucking horrible.  That magician movie.  Oh, that was fun.  That fucking, yeah.  You were in magic?  Yes.  He played Fats.  Which one?  The one, uh, Wonderstone.  Right, right, right, right.  By the way, the beginning of that movie is very funny. 
[01:30:30]  I loved the beginning of that movie.  Probably the funniest script I ever read in my life.  It's fucking funny, but then when they get into the whole, you know, he's going to change  part, then I, you kind of lost me.  Two to two thirty shows.  Yeah, Alan Arkin, I walked into the makeup trailer the first day, and Alan Arkin's sitting  there, he's wearing, it's like 40 degrees in L.A. in the morning, he's wearing flip-flops,  he's just like a fucking stoner from Santa Fe, New Mexico.  He's just complete, out the, out the, he's great.  That rules.  I walk in, he goes, oh, shit, do you do me? 
[01:31:00]  First thing he said, I go, no, he goes, good.  He's fucking, he's good, and it was really, especially at the beginning, like I said,  it was just a funny fucking moment.  There were days we didn't shoot, because Jim Carrey said, I'm not feeling it, I have  to go home.  Are you kidding?  What?  Universal City Walk.  Holy shit.  Saturday night shooting, Universal City Walk, WALK, W-A-L-K, which is, uh, not like  the fucking guy's haircut.  Right, right.  Right.  This is a porch. 
[01:31:30]  And that's like half a million dollars.  And then in Vegas one day, he said, like, he couldn't get after it.  Wait, which he did not feel after it?  Couldn't get after it, or he just didn't feel the shooting?  I fucking didn't feel it.  Woke up one day and said, it's a strange guy, huh?  It's not funny today, it's just not, it's not working.  Just not feeling it.  So we all stayed an extra day in Vegas, then we had to shoot.  Then we all got picked up by buses, like in the Luxor parking lot, and like everyone's  luggage is out.  It was like, this is what it's like to be on a hockey team.  Like you're done shooting, and there's the, like, someone like went to my room, got all  my shit. 
[01:32:00]  Holy shit.  And I just trust all my, you know, medications and asthma inhalers were all accounted for.  God?  Wow.  But I'm like Kim Jong-il Miss, and I got on a fucking bus.  Got on a bus.  Damn.  Look at that picture of me.  Um, I don't know.  I'll tweet it or something.  We should take pictures of each other slamming fucking ass, right?  Fucking shit up.  Just fucking take pictures.  Honey, look at Opie's watch.  Well, ask him what time it is.  Fucking red soul.  You know what you should have said to Alan Arkin? 
[01:32:30]  You should have said, what are you, Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross or something?  Fucking love Chip Chip.  Fucking play for the one.  I'm going to play for the one.  I'm going to play for the one.  I'm going to play for the one.  That would have been a good one, Chip.  Finally.  I know.  I fucking take a bullet for Chip.  I fucking love Chip.  Take it where?  You might have to.  You know what?  You fucking prick you.  All right.  We're going to take a break and do this proper.  Jay Moore is here in the house.  A cock.  And, um, what else?  I guess that's it, right?  Holy shit.  We'll step aside.  Stay there.  Check out the empties, man. 
[01:33:00]  I got bugs.  I got bugs in my room.  Bugs in my bed.  Bugs in my ears.  They're eggs in my head.  Bugs in my pockets.  Bugs in my shoes. 
[01:33:30]  Bugs in the way I feel about you.  Bugs out my window.  Trying to get in.  They don't go nowhere.  This is for Jay Moore.  All right.  If it takes all night, it's all right.  Pearl jam bugs.  Uh, by the way, Jay Moore is playing the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, March 28th. 
[01:34:00]  What day is that?  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night, okay.  Tomorrow night is the Borgata, and then Saturday is, of course, Foxwoods.  Foxwoods Resort with Jay Moore.  All right.  And then April 4th, Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey.  You're in the area for a while, huh?  April 5th, Westbury, Long Island.  You know why it's an island?  Because it's surrounded by water on all sides.  Let's do it.  Evolution, baby.  And Jay Moore's sports show is just kicking it.  Congratulations. 
[01:34:30]  Go get the podcast.  More stories.  Hit subscribe.  Wait, you'd rather promote the podcast than the sports show?  Well, yeah.  You can check out the sports show.  Well, that's a big deal to be on regular radio and doing it.  But I'm up against Ron and Fez.  I'm not going to come in their house.  I'm not going to come in their house.  They're fine.  Right in.  Fucking Red Soul Cups.  I want to know.  Have you seen fucking Pearl Jam?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I want to know about regular radio.  Pregame, man.  Pregame.  Fucking pregame, man.  You got a pregame, motherfucker. 
[01:35:00]  Yo, I got fucking Borgata tomorrow.  Don't take on that turnpike south.  We ain't fucking pregame.  And it's a Dolly Madison rest.  Stop getting fucking hammered.  I was just at the Borgata.  Fucking pregame, bitch.  Fuck it up.  Last weekend, Borgata.  How'd you do?  You clean up?  Nice.  Yeah, poker.  Nice.  Not blackjack.  Not poker, blackjack.  He don't give a fuck.  He sits down with Kim.  I don't give a fuck.  Kim Jung hit me over there.  Yeah.  A lot of them down there.  Oh, my God.  Fucking they don't pregame.  That's why they lose. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, this is a fucking scientific fact.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to fucking get not hammered.  Just like a nice fucking buzz.  You got to get the perfect buzz.  Totally, bro.  Right.  Totally fucking helps you.  You don't want to get fucking faced before you sit down.  Nah, nah.  Oh, don't get it twisted, Oh.  Don't get it fucking twisted.  Get a nice fucking buzz.  Nice loose.  And you're like, you know what?  Fucking split the tens, twat.  You never split.  Yeah, split tens.  Mind your fucking business. 
[01:36:00]  I'm splitting my tens.  My buddy was fucking, you know, he was bent.  So he fucking, he's splitting fucking tens.  It's a fucking animal.  He didn't pregame.  Get all juiced out.  Juiced out.  Me and Anthony got all fucking juiced out on the parkway.  Juiced out.  Fucking beautiful.  Tom's River fucking stopped over.  Good old Tom's River.  Tom's River.  Oh, Christ.  Hey, tell me about regular radio.  Are you dealing with some shit over there?  No.  You got lawyers and crap telling you what you can and can't do?  No.  Good for you.  The first thing about the radio show is they've never mentioned content at all. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  And I know what I can and can't say.  Right.  And the only big thing is like, you gotta, it's nationally syndicated.  You know this from being on professional radio.  Let me tell you how radio works, Opie.  Oh, thank you.  I don't know if you need to know, finally.  Listen, Spuds.  Yeah, like just learning the corporate clock.  Like if you're not out at 12, the whole country goes to commercial mid-sentence.  Sure.  You're a particular market.  So you gotta be a little organized.  They're not gonna wait for you. 
[01:37:00]  They always tell me like, well, these are soft outs.  These are hard outs.  I'm like, fuck that.  Everything's a hard out.  Because if I get like three in my head, that's this.  Just tell me when I need to get out.  Hit the post.  I'm in your wild, Mason.  How many stations you got?  152.  You have 152 stations?  Yeah.  Damn, motherfucker.  Fucking free game, like a fucking bastard.  That's nice.  We never had 152.  Hell no.  What do we have?  You didn't talk about the Dodgers, Lakers? 
[01:37:30]  Eight?  I don't know.  No.  Who knows?  More than that.  It's amazing what you talk about nobody cares immediately.  Just their eyes gloss over.  But if you say, like you could do like Lakers, Knicks, holy shit, like it's going down.  I've said the battle for slop, the battle for the worst in the world.  I'm in L.A., and like Lakers, Knicks, that's a national thing.  Six teams.  Nothing.  No one cares.  Nothing.  Wow.  So what do they care about?  Race and gay.  Even on the sports show. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, that's crazy.  I go, Michael Sam.  Because I think pride.  Race and gay.  Yeah.  And if you get a gay black guy, you're like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  You're crazy.  You're like, opening a fucking bogata.  21.  21.  And Criable.  So like Michael Sam announced he was gay, right?  And so I take pride in telling anybody listening, because I listen to all the shows on my drive  in and all the shows on the way home, and they're fucking horrible.  And the thing is, everyone, look, open the paper.  Here's the box score.  Everyone has the exact same numbers. 
[01:38:30]  Go.  Like, what are you going to do?  Differently.  To separate yourself from every other douche.  Smart.  Like LeBron, 42 last night in Indiana, Pacers, a game up on the heat in the east, you know?  Like, it's just garbage.  So do you want to just tell people numbers, or do you want to put on a show?  Being a comic, every morning I have a monologue that I do, and then I just think bits, bits,  bits, bits, bits.  Do you have to do a monologue every day to open your show?  I choose to do a monologue.  How long?  It's 12 minutes.  You do 12 minutes monologue every day.  Like, I'll pull sound, I'll pull, like, hey, Wang, it's a parking lot. 
[01:39:00]  Enough with the pictures, all right?  You're working it.  Yeah, just do it.  But I'm up anyway.  Was that a boner on, what's his name, when he was at the combine?  Did you see that video?  He had a huge cock on him.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, I got a huge cock on him.  He did not have a huge cock.  It looked like it was sticking out too much.  It was sticking out.  What was that?  I think he had half a rod.  There it is.  I was thinking the other guy.  There it is.  Half a rod.  Michael Sam's boner.  Right here, right here, where you see the profile.  I think it's not a boner. 
[01:39:30]  Eric, how do you say that's a huge cock?  Yeah, I compare it to mine, you know.  I'm from Canada.  What the hell is that?  Oh, my God.  What is that?  That's a rudder.  That half a rod.  Half a rod.  Half a rod.  What about the cup?  He doesn't go cup?  That didn't look like a cup.  That looked like a shot glass more than a cup.  Right.  Sticking out.  You know what I'll do?  I'll tell everybody, this is what's news, this is what's not news.  Michael Sam comes out of the closet, I go, this is a big deal, because he's saying  buyer beware.  Right. 
[01:40:00]  He comes out of the closet, and he tells every NFL team, just so you know.  Just so you know.  You're bringing the fucking circus to town when you get me.  Right.  I am SEC co-defensive player of the year.  I'm all quarterbacks.  Now, all of a sudden, every scouting report seems, like, bizarre, like, tight waist, high  motor.  You're like, whoa.  Oh.  Sounds sexy.  Yeah.  So then I told everybody, so, like, after today, no news.  Like, there's nothing.  Until the draft happens, there's nothing to talk.  And I'll say, like, these people are making a meal out of it over here. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  There's days where there's no news.  Right.  Of course.  You know that.  Oh, yeah.  Of course we know that.  Oh, yeah.  Why are you bringing the fucking bullets over here?  I heard our guys pranked Mike Francesa yesterday.  Do we have that clip?  Do we have a clip?  I love a good clip.  I tried to find it.  Here it is.  Mike Francesa gets pranked by O&A fans.  Nice.  We want more of this, by the way.  By the way, real quick.  It's a fascinating TV show to watch the top of his head read the fucking post for three  hours.  That's what he's pranking on Stocksports 1 before I did. 
[01:41:00]  Ah, shit.  You're right.  The fuck?  And he's monotone.  He obviously doesn't like his listeners.  Ray Romano, Francesa.  He doesn't want to be there.  We love him.  Anthony in East Iceland.  What's up, Anthony?  Hello, Mike.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm a Met fan.  I'm really concerned about the Met rotation this year.  The Met rotation this year?  Met rotation, yeah.  What are you concerned about?  Nice clearly is having arm problems, correct?  He did in the spring. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, well, I think the Met rotation this year could be Bartolo called.  Scott first.  Greg Hopi Hughes second.  Anthony Cummier third.  Will JimÃ©ron fourth.  And Bobo are stuck with Harry fifth.  What do you think?  I think that you basically, you know what, next time they give you one call, don't call  me.  Oh, that's a good comeback, Mike.  Mike's got it.  What a fat boy, Mike.  He's called a heckler.  Huh?  His eyes were closed. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, he looked like, huh?  Did you see the Met rotation this spring trade?  By the way, I like the name and location.  It was Anthony from East Iceland.  Right, that's where you're from.  That's where I was from when me and Boomer duked it out.  Did you see the clip where he fell asleep?  Yeah, it's amazing.  And then he tries to tell everyone he wasn't sleeping?  He just won't even admit that.  And then he got caught?  He knocks over his diet coke.  Yeah, he freaks out when he wakes up.  Yeah.  I love this.  He is out cold right there.  Looks nice.  His head's going.  His head is falling. 
[01:42:30]  He's getting into a deeper sleep.  One season, I remember the Red Sox, you know, fading out.  He's ready to hit the console.  He's so out of it.  I love this.  I love it.  He's fucking out.  That's a guy that is sleeping.  You know, look, the mic is going into his ear.  Wow.  I'd fall asleep to this dribble, too.  Well, the wake-up is the best part.  Yeah.  I think it's going in a second here. 
[01:43:00]  I don't know if he's out this long.  To wake up and realize, uh-oh, I've been.  He's panicked.  He has no idea what's going on.  That is a great clip.  And now he's talking to his producer, like, what happened?  Where am I?  What is this guy talking about?  Hi, old Kermit the Francesa here.  I am on the fan. 
[01:43:30]  When he wakes up and his eyes go really big.  Because he didn't know where he was.  You've got to get the explanation now.  Just like when people call you when you're sleeping.  I know it's like a hack bit, but it's true.  Anytime somebody goes, like, were you sleeping?  You're like, no.  Like, you just go to the-  Why is that?  No.  Like, 30 seconds later, you're falling back asleep.  He just goes, like, no.  Everything's good, bro.  He doesn't answer the guy's question.  That's when they call him out on it.  He's such a fucking baby.  Where's the explanation?  Because he refuses to admit that he fell asleep.  But it's obvious to everyone he did.  I was just looking at the table. 
[01:44:00]  Wow, you fell on Aerosmith.  But he looked up and said, where am I?  What's going on?  What is this guy talking about?  He was caught.  Yeah.  Caught.  It's 44 B-U-C-K-S.  I wasn't going to address this.  And often, I don't like wasting your time and my time with nonsense.  But since it has become a story, it was in the paper today.  You know, and the only reason I'm doing this is because my wife won't talk to me until I do it. 
[01:44:30]  Sunday, when we opened the season up with the NFL now, I did what I usually do.  I got upset.  Now I'm sleeping.  Now I'm sleeping.  I got upset.  I got upset.  Went home and watched football.  I got my date over.  It's 1 o'clock in the morning.  I'm fishing up after watching Denver and Peyton Manning, which was a pleasure.  Sitting there in my office watching that on Sunday night.  And then, as happens sometimes, you know, when you get sick, it would happen.  One of my sons took me from asthma, Jack. 
[01:45:00]  And recently, as the weather changes, he has some exercise-induced asthma.  And I didn't get to sleep some of the night.  So, you know, that happens as a parent.  I mean, luckily, I have healthy kids.  And, you know, sometimes it happens.  Now, my wife got mad at me because I didn't mention this when I came in here on Monday.  And Monday morning, when I put the kids to school, which I do every morning, I put them  in school, but she was fighting me not to go leave early, which I did.  And she said, you better get some sleep because you haven't slept.  You can't go and do a show.  And I said, I've done it a million times. 
[01:45:30]  And she's like, you know, you're not 20 anymore.  Well, I came in.  I haven't slept all night.  And obviously, I was dragging during the show, which led to me closing my eyes during  the Sweeney Murty interview and causing this hurrah, which none of us here knew about  until yesterday because people now accuse me of being asleep during the Sweeney because  I closed my eyes during the interview, which I shouldn't have done.  And I was exhausted.  I hadn't slept the night before.  You were sleeping.  Okay.  And I've done that many times through the years.  I mean, 25 years, I can tell you, not just when my kids were born, but many times. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, Dog and I did 25 hours in a row.  Eight minutes to go.  Many nights where I've come in here and not slept the night and done a show.  So maybe I have to never try that again at this stage because I was exhausted late in  the show.  But I can promise you this.  I did close my eyes during the Sweeney interview for a minute.  And it was on TV.  And that's become this big bone of contention because I guess everything we do on the show  does.  But I can promise you, as you can go listen to the interview, I was never asleep.  Oh, God.  Did you see me? 
[01:46:30]  It's a bone of contention.  I was straight up.  Just those guys?  I would say this.  Like I would say at the opening in the restroom or in a car or whatever.  The reason it's viral is because everybody that listens to this guy's show works their  fucking balls off for a living.  Yeah.  And they can't fathom working four hours a day.  Exactly.  A 20-hour work week is out of the consciousness of every single human being listening to the  show.  Except the people sitting around with their Wu-Tang sticker bong between their knees right  now waiting for a fucking Mesothelioma commercial.  But he said he was watching fucking Peyton. 
[01:47:00]  And he got a little tired.  Yeah.  He got a little tired watching Peyton.  And then you got to get up and do four hours.  It's tough.  But he should have just said, all right, yeah, I fell asleep.  Yeah.  It happened a couple times in my 25 years.  I love that one, too.  He spills his soda.  His Diet Coke.  And on Borgata, Foxwoods, Bananas, and Westbury, which one do you think is sold the least?  And it's by a lot.  I would go with Jersey you got.  You got Jersey. 
[01:47:30]  Jersey's 1,000 seats.  I would hate to say.  Foxwoods, Saturday night, 1,500 seats.  Bananas, like, what, 200 seats in Hasbro Heights on April 5th?  The space at Westbury in Westbury, Long Island.  I'm going Westbury.  Sorry.  Why would you say Westbury?  You're not a draw on Long Island.  I'm going to say Foxwoods, probably.  Foxwoods fucking gone, honey.  Oh, yeah?  Bing, bing, bing.  Give it up.  Spuds McKenzie.  Long Island's a weird place for some of you guys.  The space at Westbury. 
[01:48:00]  Don't fucking wreck this for me, Long Island.  I don't know why.  I go all the way across the country and tell some fucking gags.  You can't make the 40-mile drive.  You prick you.  Because those guys are willing to travel to see their comedy.  But when it's in their backyard for some reason, they don't go as much.  I've noticed that over the years with some of you guys.  The big thing like, you want to play the space at Westbury?  Never heard of it.  I usually do Governors.  Like, no, man.  Got to do the space at Westbury.  Nah, you know, I'm really comfortable at Governors.  No, man.  It's like a great new spot.  It's called the space at Westbury.  It's not a new spot.  They just changed the name.  40% of the tickets sold.  Isn't that Westbury Music Fair? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just changed the name.  Are you going in the round?  I don't know.  They go in the round there.  It's a different place.  I can't go anywhere.  She'll give it to me.  I don't know.  I don't think it's a different place.  Is it Westbury Music Fair?  No, it's the space at Westbury.  No, it's not the Westbury Music Fair anymore.  But it might be called the space.  And then they called it after a bank.  I don't know.  What's the space?  Let's look at it.  Gavin DeGaugh.  Art Garfunkel.  Maybe it is.  Art Garfunkel's going to be there.  Let's see the space.  There's Jay Moores.  When do I follow Oates?  Look at Garfunkel's hair.  That's a house. 
[01:49:00]  That's not it.  Easy, Chip.  Wait.  Maybe it is a different place.  That is a different place.  It's a different place.  Number 40 times I said the space at Westbury.  Yeah, but they changed the name a lot.  They changed the name of these places a lot.  But you're right.  How many seats is this?  I don't know.  You know how many now?  Half of them.  That's how many there are.  We'll see Jay Moores at the space at Westbury.  Too many.  Apparently too many seats.  Jeez.  And Foxwoods.  Let's go.  Tomorrow.  Foxwoods. 
[01:49:30]  Come on, you fucking pricks.  I got on a plane for this, Henry.  Why don't you ever come out to the East Coast?  Well, you're going to find out in about a week.  Sometimes more than that, eh?  Do you still do the sports show?  Or are you off this week?  I'm off this week so I could focus.  Trying to make another baby, if you really want to know.  Wow.  Going for another baby.  Fucking.  Is that crazy?  Are they cutting your balls open?  I love that big rack.  They're going to have to, yeah.  They're going to have to cut his balls open and take out some sperms.  Why?  Because they're like goddamn baggage handlers at JFK, my sperm. 
[01:50:00]  They don't want to move.  There's like six of them.  They bump into each other on the way out.  They're hanging.  It's a fucking tan.  It's like the two guys dumb enough to get in a moose suit for Halloween.  And I'll think it through that one guy's got to put his face in the other guy's ass  the whole night of the party.  Two guys in one horse moose suit.  Yeah, sure.  So my sperm are those two guys.  You've got to assume if you're in the moose suit, you're holding your buddy's hips.  Half the night.  Because how else would you fucking make that work?  This is off of Bonoro's moose suit.  How do they know to get the best one? 
[01:50:30]  The best moose?  Oh, the best one?  Because they look at it.  It's like flapping his tail.  Some of them have Coke bottle heads.  Some of them are indented.  Yeah, because I know it's like a fucking Hydra.  I think it's like, because in natural fertilization, those sperm race and fight each other and shit.  And then the goal is that the best, fittest one wins the race, and that's the better sperm.  Let me explain my sperm to you.  You ever been to Dwayne Reed?  Yes.  You ever asked anybody for help?  Yes, I have, Jay. 
[01:51:00]  Did you smudge glasses?  I'm assuming.  If we have it, it would be right over there.  I know if you have it where it would be.  I want to know if you have it.  It's not, and do you have it?  Do you sell Sports Illustrated?  The magazine's over there.  No, do you sell Sports Illustrated?  If we have it, it would be right over there.  Right.  Okay, do you sell it?  My man, if we had it, it'd be in the magazine department, which is in the section right there  on the thing.  Smudge glasses.  So you're doing it for a procedure?  Yeah, we're trying now. 
[01:51:30]  I'm up and at him now.  Taking a little Cialis.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Can't be caught slipping.  You got a boner right now?  No.  Jimmy shows us his boners.  Jimmy's in it.  I have very low libido.  Jimmy has a high libido.  Yeah.  So when I take Cialis, my wife goes, how does she put it?  You want to fuck?  How does she put it?  And I go, all right.  And she said this last night.  We ordered room service at the hotel.  She goes, you have to make it quick.  She's pulling on her sweatpants.  She goes, you have to make it quick.  I'm like, I'll do my best. 
[01:52:00]  You know me.  Fucking Jim Fix.  Fucking Marathon, man.  Jesus Christ.  Like, out of nowhere.  Been married fucking 10 years.  You have to make it quick.  Make it quick.  What am I, a fucking new guy?  Wait, do you dump quick or no?  What do you take a dump?  What the fuck?  Yes.  I'm powerless.  I'm powerless.  How long do you take the dump?  If it's a, never longer than three minutes.  Really?  Wow.  I envy that.  That's great, man.  And if I take longer than that, I start to lose my erection because I get in my head like, 
[01:52:30]  yeah, I hope this stays up.  This would be great.  And then I'm like, fuck.  I fucking, I lose focus.  It depends on who you're with.  If you're with somebody you've been with for fucking 10 years or something and you shove  your dick in there and just want to get it over with, then you get it over with.  But if you're with somebody you want to please, then you have to fucking like, all right,  I'm going to come.  You got to pull out and shove your face down there for a while.  Get everything stirred up.  There's a whole system.  Here's the thing, though.  When you're married that long, she's very goal-oriented. 
[01:53:00]  And she hits that goal.  Like, she starts at the one-yard line.  Yeah.  So she punches it in.  You know, she's in.  She's quick.  So, like, she can get two, three in the time it takes me to get that quick one.  Gotcha.  But she's better at it than I am, obviously.  Fucking great.  Yeah.  I like a girl, too, that doesn't mind, like, in the morning, just, hey, I just want to fuck  literally 30 seconds and shoot and get the fuck out of here.  Cool. 
[01:53:30]  That's how my wife is.  That's great.  My wife's like, if you put your penis inside me, I will come because your penis is inside  Well, given the time, it's like fucking going out to dinner.  Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, spend a long time, sometimes you shove a burrito  down your throat.  That's true.  But it's like...  So in this scenario, let's walk you through.  Let's go to the comedy chalkboard.  A vagina would be a mouth and a throat, and your cock would be a burrito.  The burrito.  It could be.  And the two bodies together.  So fast food is what you're saying.  You like to drive through with it.  Yeah, fast food.  It doesn't always have to be this fucking movie whimsical time in bed. 
[01:54:00]  Where you have to listen for the specials.  Yes, for the specials.  But sometimes, you know, you could just do those quick fucking get it over with, and  then other times, you know, you fucking...  It's a long procedure.  It's hard for me to dump a load, man.  It takes a while.  I can help you.  I can take care of it for you, Jimmy.  It takes a while.  You know what?  You go to the hotel and have sex with my wife.  I bet you don't last one minute.  No, no, no.  Believe me.  You think you last more than a minute with my wife?  It's not the girl.  You fucked my wife?  It's never the girl.  It's never the girl.  You fucked my wife?  What?  That's a crazy girl. 
[01:54:30]  Kill Jay.  Kill Alan Arkin.  Kill Steve Carell.  Kill me.  No, it's never the girl.  It's never the girl.  It's always my own psychotic.  It takes you a really long time.  It's your mind, right?  My mind, Jay.  I know.  I got to put up my nipples.  I'm married to a fucking psychopath.  It doesn't matter.  It does matter.  For me, it doesn't.  For you, it doesn't matter.  Because it's never the girl.  Everyone's got their thing that you need.  Yeah, it's never the girl.  Some little thing.  There's nothing...  Here's the thing about my wife.  There's nothing in your head that she doesn't just completely override. 
[01:55:00]  Because I'm naughty like you.  Please, just fuck my wife.  Please, man.  I'm fucking asking a fucking baby here.  Jesus.  I didn't reach you for a fucking thing over here.  I want you to bang this broad.  Go to the fucking peninsula and fucking throw it out.  You might get a nice piece of property out of this, Jim.  So are they cutting your balls open or not?  Where are you trying it the natural way?  Well, that's like a last case scenario.  Okay, gotcha.  We're going to trade the natural way for a long time.  Oh, my God.  I love that.  Oh, that's one of the best commercials going. 
[01:55:30]  Wonderful stylings.  We make your dreams come true.  The grand pass back home.  Right.  Yeah.  Is that as good as the space at Westbury, April 5th?  Hold on.  This guy, AJ, wants it.  Come on.  Hold on.  We got a Brooklyn guy.  AJ, go ahead.  Jay Moore in studio.  Jay Moore?  How you doing, Jay Moore?  Yeah, I'm getting you pregnant.  You're sick.  You're sick.  I didn't touch your fucking wife.  You're sick.  You're fucking sick of the head.  When you do a little less eating and a little more fucking, your life would have been such a fucking mess.  Stop eating.  I want to ask you a serious question, Jay. 
[01:56:00]  I've known you for a while.  You'll know who this is, but since when do you not sell out a fucking place in Long Island?  What has this world come to that Jay Moore has got a whole ticket to Long Island when he used to sell out the joints?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's the world coming to?  I think he's got a lot of area shows is the problem there.  It doesn't matter.  There's only one Long Island stop, Opie, is what our friend is.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of losers in fucking Long Island.  Long Island. 
[01:56:30]  Long Island.  The space of Westbury.  Jay Moore.  April 5th.  Go get your tickets.  You got to go to that.  You just compared a burrito to my cock over here.  Not your cock.  You're a cocktail, Frank, my friend.  Okay.  All right.  Here's the, uh, we make your dreams come true, lady.  We make your dreams come true.  The Grand Prospect Hall.  718-788-0777.  We make your dreams come true.  We make your dreams come true. 
[01:57:00]  It's like the auto-enjorgement.  Hello, I'm Dr. Pecoraro.  I will whistle through your asshole.  It's amazing.  These people do their own commercials.  They're great.  They insist on it.  I was in that business for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Making the local commercials way back in the day.  If you put the owners in the commercial, they're all in.  Then they're in.  They will fucking write that check.  No problem.  They all want to be little TV stars.  He would be like, have your best wedding ever in here.  The plane.  I dealt with all those guys. 
[01:57:30]  They were the worst.  Sometimes the bride feed the groom.  The bride feed the groom.  So long day, boys.  In Great Neck, we got that fucking guy.  Five hundred dollars.  I don't know that guy.  Five hundred dollars cash.  Find him.  Fucking car salesman guy, of course.  The loudest commercials.  What about the car dealerships that find the one broad in the office that is almost hot?  Almost hot.  And they put her on the front screen.  You've got to talk about your accuracy.  They're like six and a halves. 
[01:58:00]  Restaurant hot.  You know what's restaurant hot?  Restaurant hot.  When you're a waiter at a restaurant, all of a sudden there's a new waitress, and everybody's like,  God damn sharks in the water, circling, circling.  And then you take her home, and you have sex with her.  Just because she's new.  And like two weeks later, you're dating her, and you're like, what the fuck?  This is a sex tox?  Fucking what am I doing?  Just because she was new.  It's like the first time.  Yes.  Just because, you know, counting crows you thought was good for a second because it was new.  That's great.  Is this the guy?  Yeah, here's this guy.  How annoying to hear him.  I'm back.  500.  500 dollars.  This is Joe Valentino from Great Neck Nissan, and that's what I'm willing to pay. 
[01:58:30]  Call this guy right now.  I can't be your very best deal.  Do you know how fucking annoying this is at like one in the morning?  I've left the TV on.  I've turned the volume down on the movie, but the commercials are louder, and he comes on.  For a brand new car.  Come on down to Great Neck Nissan.  This fucking, you know, this goddamn 25-8.  He's behind him.  Can we call him right now?  I don't think he's at him.  Yeah, I don't know.  That is annoying.  That is a bad one.  You guys are like murmur. 
[01:59:00]  Murmur, murmur.  So did we find the plane today?  No.  Still no.  That plane's out.  You sure?  Won't see that plane no more.  Anthony, I like your thought.  You know, I've been out of the loop here, but what do you think happened?  Oh, God.  He went with terrorism.  I had 30 different scenarios over the course of this whole thing.  Pilot, co-pilot, working in concert.  I'm thinking now, just pilot.  I think one of the pilots dumped it.  Just fucking dumped it in the water.  Dumped it for whatever reason.  Yeah, to be determined.  So why would all like transponders and stuff like that pick it up?  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  It's one of the most highly trafficked areas in the world.  He caved in his co-pilot's head with a hammer and then fucking just put it on autopilot and  flew...  Maybe they're trying to give each other haircuts.  Flew...  Flew out into the most isolated part of the world as far as oceans go.  What?  It's between eight countries.  Dumped it.  Isolated.  No one goes down there.  It's deep.  23,000...  No one goes down there.  No one goes down there.  It's like a broken Marianne's trench.  No one goes down near Australia to the west there.  Like in that part, it's like unless you're going to Antarctica, you're not flying there. 
[02:00:00]  Exactly.  Wait, Australia?  That's new to me.  I thought I was between Vietnam and China.  Where the fuck have you been?  That's well over with gold.  You want to know where I've been?  I've been out earning a fucking wage.  Checking those box scores.  So you're only checking the box scores.  Turn the paper over.  That's where the sharks go.  That's 1,600 miles off the coast of Perth.  It's past Australia, so no one goes there unless literally you're flying to Antarctica.  Right.  Or if you're going over the pole to go to the other side of the coast.  Or the other side of the coast. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  The other side of the coast.  How about no military people at one of our destroyers, an Australian destroyer goes like,  hey, something's on my fucking radar.  Right?  Nothing.  How does it not get picked up?  In this day and day, hoping you just to click through my name.  They said Indian radar is off at night.  The military turns the radio.  They really do.  I think it's off at night.  And that's why they said he probably took that route.  Save the batteries.  Because he knew what was on and what was off.  What the fuck is Pakistan waiting for?  Just steamroll these people.  They save the batteries on satellites.  If they've got to turn their fucking radar.  That's a big thing, right?  Yes.  If they've got to turn their radar off at night, that's when you send your shit over them.  Just fucking walk across the border like you own the place. 
[02:01:00]  I can send you nukes.  It's Carla's new special.  It's all about India and Pakistan.  And they're all battling over Kashmir.  Thank God Robert Plant stepped in and did an homage tribute song.  To, you know, sort of push the tide back a little bit.  Let's see.  Those two countries.  I've got to make wee.  Huh?  Do you?  What the fuck?  I just drank this huge fucking smoothie.  I've got to make wee.  What was in your smoothie, Opie?  Today it was kale, spinach, mango.  You've got to find a lizard head in your kale. 
[02:01:30]  Lizard head.  Oh, you weren't really listening to what was in it.  You were just sitting there for a bit.  No, I was not.  Yes, you were.  How did I say lizard head unless I was going to a village?  Because I didn't say mango yet.  I was still giving you the ingredients.  Right.  And I just jumped on one that flashed in my head as a thing.  I can't do a bit about kale if I'm not listening to you say fucking kale.  Fucking kale.  I thought you actually cared.  I didn't know you set me up for a bit.  You listen to me.  Ready?  Kale, spinach, mango.  That's as far as you fucking got.  That's it today. 
[02:02:00]  That's it today.  Fucking cranky cunt.  Nice water.  Fuck.  You gave me three ingredients.  Those are the three.  But you jumped in after two.  Because I thought of kale and the lady found the lizard head and her fucking kale, you fucking cock.  No, but he said.  Shut up.  No, he said.  I'm disgusted with the two of you.  No, no, no, no.  There's three of us.  No, no, no.  But you said.  But that's not what he said.  Right.  I don't give a fuck what he drinks.  Personally, I don't give a fuck what he drinks.  Personally.  Look, personally. 
[02:02:30]  Order me the cake.  I don't give a fuck.  Can I make whee?  Go make some whee.  Are we all making whee?  Let's see what I want.  Or you guys continue.  I don't care.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  All right, let's make whee.  I'm going to go to that kitchen area thing that I've only been to once in my whole life.  And get a beverage.  Really?  Do you know, I've been down there like twice.  The first time I ever went in there was like two weeks ago.  And I've been here for how long?  It's pretty amazing what they got down there.  I was like, this is the fucking best place.  They got a lot of nice beverages down there.  Beverages.  What else could you get down there in the kitchen? 
[02:03:00]  I'm going to go grab a goddamn beverage.  Can I get a smoothie with kale, spinach, and mango and ice water?  All right.  You fuck.  What are the ways that I miss?  Is that Canadian?  No, I didn't do any of the boosts today.  Those are all called boosts.  I decided to do no boosts.  Somebody just tweeted me, the space at Westbury is the my space of Long Island.  Oh.  Is it?  What else could you get in the kitchen, Sal?  They have a Starbucks machine there.  Starbucks machine.  Nice.  I've never heard of it, Jay.  Maybe that's why I'm selling it.  Now, governors, I'd have been there.  Yeah, we like governors. 
[02:03:30]  We support governors.  I love governors.  We could go there a lot.  We like the governors.  I don't know why they're not on the list this trip.  All right.  Jay Moore, Bogada, tomorrow night, Foxwood, Saturday, Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, April 4th,  and then this place called The Space at Westbury on April 5th.  Empty space.  O.P. and S.N.A. will be right back on Sirius XM.  Feel free to rub one.  Wow.  Jay's down the hall doing a froner for another radio station? 
[02:04:00]  That's what I saw.  All right, then.  Took a little walk with me to the kitchen.  That must have been very relaxing.  We were chatting.  Chatting.  Jay likes to chat about ten things at the same time.  I think he asked me like five or six things in the bathroom.  I couldn't answer one of them because he was on to the next question.  He's got a lot on his mind.  We like the Jay Moore.  He's playing all over the place.  So, girls.  And we got Mindy coming in a little bit. 
[02:04:30]  Yes, Mindy Kaling.  Mindy Kaling.  I might as well squeeze in my plugs while I can.  I'm doing Tampa April 11th and 12th, and then Caroline's at 24th through the 27th.  I'm going.  Thank you.  Caroline's.  Hell yeah.  I like the Caroline's.  I want you to stretch out.  Oh, God.  That's why I'll never shoot a special in New York.  Never.  Really?  No.  Never.  Fucking pricks.  You haven't played New York in a while.  Um, no.  Which one?  Caroline's will be fine.  Yeah.  Maybe it'll be my birthday night out. 
[02:05:00]  When is your birthday?  April 26th.  Oh.  April 5th.  Thank you.  But that's, but that's after Jimmy's there.  No.  No, Jimmy's there on the 26th.  Oh.  24, 25, 26, 27.  Why wasn't I listening?  What is it?  Saturday?  Yeah.  Oh, my birthday's on a Saturday this year?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Hamid.  I'm going to buy it on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  Right.  I might have to take a few days off.  Oh, boy.  Recoup, as they say.  Oh, party time.  Look at all these empties, man. 
[02:05:30]  There are seats in my fucking game.  Oh, Jimmy.  You know what we should do to your, for Saturday night, we should play that Bay City Roller  song, Saturday Night.  That's such a cool party song.  Oh, Saturday.  It kills, right?  That one or the other one?  No, Saturday Night.  Oh, Saturday Night.  Is that the Bay City Roller?  Saturday Night.  Rock and roll, right?  It's terrible.  S-A-T-U-R.  Ah.  Look at this video.  Jesus.  Oh, they're Nancy Grace hairdos?  They are those wacky English mullet. 
[02:06:00]  Haircut.  Or the Opster, 1998.  Oh.  Saturday night, Saturday night.  Oh, what a faggot song this was.  This is like the Archies.  It's terrible.  Girls love them.  Was always them on Tiger Beat and Teen Beat.  Yeah.  Do they have any other songs?  Tonight, the Bay City Roller is on Don Kirsten's rock concert.  Oh, there's a Saturday night. 
[02:06:30]  What were the other songs they did?  What's this, 76?  Yeah.  Crazy.  Saturday night.  Oh, I remember hearing that song as a child.  Swear.  Saturday night.  Right.  There's some more songs by them.  Wow.  This really gets old.  Enough of these guys.  That's some more Bay City Rollers in here if you want them.  Bay City Rollers.  Bay City Rollers, Jay.  Come on.  You were all in.  What are some other songs by them? 
[02:07:00]  The Way I Feel Tonight?  The Way I Feel Tonight.  T-U-R.  No.  Saturday night, I'm at Foxwoods.  Ah, there's a good one.  Yes, you are, Jay Moore.  I don't remember this one.  The Bay City Rollers slowed it down.  I only want to be with you.  How about that one?  What's that lyric?  I only want to be with you.  It was chilling.  Is it I only want to be with you?  I don't know.  What the fuck is this?  I'll play I only want to be with you.  They had one goddamn hit.  What's douchey Beatles knockoffs? 
[02:07:30]  I don't get any credit for pulling that one out.  I didn't hear it.  It was good.  What's this one, Travis?  I only want to be with you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We were just playing that one.  Disco.  Oh, this is.  This one came after.  It's called Place Your Fair.  I just did my colon.  Oh.  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, we know this one.  Is this a remake?  It's a song from the 50s, yeah.  You Made Me Believe in Magic.  That was a good song by Bay City Rollers. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, this is a remake.  How do you know the Bay City Rollers?  Huh?  How do you know about this?  Say what now?  Bay City Rollers.  Be with you.  Yeah, I don't know about the Bay City Rollers, but no.  This is a remake, so it's not even like one of theirs.  It's every guy you see unloading a truck in Manhattan.  Huh?  Yo, no, man.  Uh, Bay City Rollers.  What?  No?  Just bang on it.  Oh, shot, shot, please.  Huh?  What?  Huh?  What?  Every conversation you walk by in Manhattan, where a guy's loading or unloading a truck,  one guy goes, huh? 
[02:08:30]  What?  Huh?  Say what now?  Bay City Rollers.  Oh, oh, serious.  I'm all sad.  I'm all right now.  Huh?  What?  Yo, man.  Hey, man.  Huh?  What?  You want to learn more about Westbury?  Yeah.  Okay.  Huh?  What?  This guy has info on the space in Westbury, where you're playing April 5th.  Go ahead, Mark.  Hey, guys.  So, Jay, this place is on Post Avenue.  Post Avenue.  Huh?  What?  One half are fine, upstanding Italian citizens, and the other half are the people that Anthony 
[02:09:00]  complain about a lot.  Oh, no, no.  Wait a minute.  Is that...  I know where that is.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm Post Ave.  That's a...  What do you mean you complain about mine?  Huh?  What?  Once you pass, like, the trestle, it gets real bad.  Post Ave can get a little sketchy.  I thought that was going to be a runner.  Why don't you turn off of Jericho?  All right.  It's north of the trestle.  Where's Jericho's going?  We're trying to take this phone call for you, Jay.  I know.  It's great.  You may want to hire Kenny.  You want to learn about Westbury, don't you?  Fuck that.  I'll let my fucking fist fly, man.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[02:09:30]  I'll go Kenny.  Stay in the...  I had to use a property there years ago.  It's not a great area.  It's not a great area.  Who convinced you to buy property in a place that's filled with people you're not crazy about?  That doesn't mean you can't make money, though.  Oh.  Ah.  He's a slumlord.  Once again, the Jew is taking advantage of the Negro.  Actually, I'm a guinea.  All right.  You thought the neighborhood would turn around, right?  Ah, you take a shot.  Did you make...  Just like Anthony, you take a shot.  Did you...  You really got to...  You know what?  Maybe this is... 
[02:10:00]  You got to do your research on those neighborhoods.  Yeah.  What's his fellow's name on the phone?  You got to make sure they are going to turn around.  It's Mark.  Hey, Mark.  First of all, I appreciate your input very much.  Secondly, maybe this should be a little red flag.  The website for the space at Westbury...  What is it?  April 5th?  What am I in front of me?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be there.  It's like a photo from the 20s.  Yeah.  Right.  It's like a...  It is.  It looks like a Schwab's, and they're going to discover talent in the little...  Well, it says our history, though.  Old guys with suits and hats on. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Then old cars.  And then the next photo...  It's a movie theater from 1920s.  It's a drawing.  It's a drawing of the building.  It's an architectural drawing.  Next photo is a 3D computer...  A rendering.  Like, in court, like, this is how she got bludgeoned to death in the stairwell.  Uh-huh.  And then it may have happened like this.  Computer generate...  There's no photo...  There's no actual new picture of it.  They didn't follow the sketch, though.  No, huh?  No.  The sketch is very different.  You know what?  Fuck it.  I'm playing someplace else.  Nah.  You'll do good.  You can't do that, right?  Fuck it, man. 
[02:11:00]  Pregame?  Fuck it, me and Antle go.  Oh, there it is.  That's just a play.  Building it?  It's not even built.  No wonder I can't sell it out.  There's no chairs at all.  That's when they were building it.  Let's look at the rest of the neighborhood around it.  But, real quick, on a side note...  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is five people that are on the computer every day for hours.  Right.  I mean, eight.  Right.  And we're now, like, on our eighth search.  Just to know what this place looks like.  There's a fucking bank.  I know where that is.  I know.  Manhole.  We got close up.  Put a fucking drone to this neighborhood. 
[02:11:30]  Jesus Christ.  Well, that looks like a nice neighborhood.  What's the problem?  It looks very, uh...  It's a small town.  Hey, Mark, which way do you go?  If you're on fire.  Which way do you go for the bad stuff?  East or west?  If you're standing, uh, facing the theater, you're going to go to the right.  Are we going to the right?  We're going to the right.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's do this.  Keep going down.  It looks pretty nice.  We're a couple blocks down.  I don't see any of those shoes.  It looks nice.  It looks like the Ham...  Oh, yeah.  That's all right.  I think the Ham... 
[02:12:00]  That's fine.  Yeah, we're still doing all right.  What are you talking about?  You're lying.  This is a nice little Long Island Hamlet.  Right.  It's wonderful.  Oh, now we're in the suburbs.  We're fine.  This is the whitest place I've ever seen.  Come on, dude.  What are you talking about?  Oh, wait a minute.  You're talking out your ass.  Here we go.  Okay, what's that problem?  Across the tracks.  The projects.  We literally went across the tracks.  That's the Bristol.  That's the part of the complex called the Bristol.  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  There you go.  It's breaking down quickly.  Those train tracks... 
[02:12:30]  Looks like New Orleans.  It broke down quickly.  Those train tracks are the Great Divide.  The Mason-Dixon line out there.  Oh, shit.  It's amazing.  All right.  What are we in fucking Ronkonk?  Come on now.  Yeah, the conk.  The conk.  Fucking hanging out in the conk.  School bus.  Watch out for the school bus.  You almost hit the school bus.  It's empty.  Oh.  Poor God.  It's tomorrow night, you pricks.  Look, I flew 3,000 miles for this.  Don't wreck it for me.  Foxwood's tomorrow night.  What's that building on the corner there? 
[02:13:00]  It's a drugstore.  Bodega.  That looks all right.  Yeah.  You don't have to go in the parking lot.  Keep going.  That looks good.  The Winner's Circle.  The Winner's Circle.  It's called the Winner's Circle.  Nice.  So this is Westbury, Long Island, huh?  Yeah.  We're taking a little tour of Westbury.  But we still don't have a photo.  The main thoroughfare.  Oh, my God.  Is that a store for cemetery plots?  It's a headstone store.  All right.  There must be a cemetery nearby, right?  You're in the head shop.  That's a headstone shop.  What?  Right across the street.  The cemetery's right there.  Country Road.  Honestly, it's Country Road.  It's really not that bad. 
[02:13:30]  Why aren't there photos of the theater anywhere?  Now we're in Merrick.  Take a guess.  This place is very close to me.  No.  What is the guess?  That it doesn't...  It's like a shitty looking place?  We got a guy that's been to the club.  He's going to tell you what you're in for.  Thank you to Mark.  Now we're going to feed.  Mark's a good man.  Pete.  Hi.  Morning, fellas.  Hey, Pete.  How you doing?  What's up?  What's up?  You guys got to play the place in Huntington.  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah?  You should book me there.  It's like four...  What am I got Frosty for?  Four stores.  Right.  Frosty knows.  I was just there with Jim Brewer. 
[02:14:00]  I forgot the name of it all of a sudden.  The Paramount.  Thank you, Travis.  Another guy I can't get on a podcast.  What?  Frosty or Brewer?  Brewer.  Frosty.  Frosty.  How you doing, Pete?  You got to play the Paramount in Huntington.  It's an amazing venue.  And it's right down the street from F.H. Riley's.  Hey.  Where's Pete called?  Family Dining.  Go ahead, Pete.  Paramount's beautiful, number one.  Oh, if I stopped by your place to eat after this.  Of course you did.  My brother does an amazing job there.  I don't even have to promote the damn place anymore.  He's doing that well.  Thank you, Pete.  Yeah, it was great.  But I went to the space in Westbury maybe like a month and a half, two months ago to see 
[02:14:30]  a band Lotus.  And the place is pretty awesome.  It's brand new.  Yeah, they're starting to...  Do they got the walls up and do they get the chairs in?  Because the picture we're looking at, there seems to be some major problems.  No, no, no.  Okay, good.  They got chairs, Jay.  You're in good shape.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they got you playing this weekend, Jay, and Jim Jefferies is lined up to be there.  It's not going to be like a concert venue standing only, you know? 
[02:15:00]  Well, the problem is he's not...  Was Duff in it?  Or did they replace Duff?  I'm not sure.  Wait, Lotus is what?  A little Guns N' Roses offshore?  I think he said Loaded.  No, no.  It's like a...  Oh, that sounds gay.  It's like a jam band.  Jam Toronto.  No, no.  Fucking jam band.  No, Lotus is good.  They're from Indiana.  Fuck them.  They're from Indiana, right?  Oh, yeah.  Philly.  Close enough, though.  No.  Goshen College.  They all went to Goshen College in Indiana, Lotus.  I can read Wikipedia, too, Jay. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, I fucking Wikipedia sit in the fucking desk for you.  You're reading Wikipedia, you son of a bitch.  We don't like jam bands on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Although, every once in a while, a little Grateful Dead, though.  No.  None of that.  Garbage.  It's a little bit.  It's all garbage.  And the Allman Brothers, when they do their 80-minute version of Statesboro Blues or something.  You sat there and watched that shit?  Fuck yeah.  Mike Rempel on guitar, dude.  Give us one Loaded song.  We need to listen to this. 
[02:16:00]  Put on vibes.  That's out of print.  You don't know that song.  Where did I fucking get this shit by?  I'm calling you out.  First of all, it's not a song.  It's an album.  Oh, okay.  Is that what Wikipedia says?  I'm throwing you under a bus.  Am I on the computer right now?  Look me right in my eyes.  Tell the truth.  Sal's working with you.  No, Jay is looking.  I'll confirm.  Jay is looking to the left and up.  And to see the computer, he would have to look to the right and straight ahead.  Fucking prick. 
[02:16:30]  Now he's looking.  Why is Lotus cool?  Maybe you turn people out to Lotus today.  I got introduced to Lotus through the band, like the Disco Biscuits.  And they throw their own festival over the summer for the last 10, 12 years.  You must get a ton of pussy, man.  If he wasn't so into cock, he would.  How many songs can Lotus play in one set?  Oh, look at that.  Like six, seven at the last.  Four, 20 minutes each.  Fucking bore fest. 
[02:17:00]  I can't tell you something.  I'm with you guys.  Like my favorite band, one of my favorite bands, like the Black Crows.  When they start doing like Whoa, Mule and Hot Burrito 1, Hot Burrito 2, like 18, I'm  like fucking get me.  I was, that's when I tapped out.  I loved the Black Crows for a long time.  They had so many great songs.  Yeah, their songs started getting longer and trippier.  Don't play the Allman Brothers.  It's not even there.  They're doing covers of long shit.  Right.  I've got Lotus up in here.  Yeah.  I'm seeing a lot of 9-minute, 11-minute, 12-minute.  Oh, I got it.  Let me hear some of this shit.  You don't like a nice jam band song?  Oh, do I hate a jam band? 
[02:17:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  Pete, what song should we play?  Let's see if they got bellwether, like B-E-L-W-E-T-H-E-R.  You know what bellwether means.  Exactly.  How else would you spell bellwether?  Do they have bellwether, Travis?  I don't know what that one's telling me to say.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you got it?  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  H-E-T-H-E-R.  Bellwether or not.  I'm already annoyed because I know what's coming.  Right now you can't be annoyed.  Yeah, I've got to bring bellwether with things. 
[02:18:00]  I am.  Oh, my God.  Is this Max Headroom?  Oh.  These are two robots fucking right now.  All right, go a minute in now.  We get this part.  Let's see if it changes.  All right, they add a few more instruments.  They just added some more shit.  Yeah!  So you're going to sit.  So you're just going to sit.  All right, move another minute in.  Yeah!  This is like that, uh, that, uh, pump. 
[02:18:30]  Foxwood Saturday.  Can't more hard.  All right, move another minute in.  That's a lot of fucking cowbell.  Yeah.  Bellwether.  Bring it back to cowbell.  We need less cowbell.  Another minute in.  There's no way I can sit through this.  One song.  One more minute in.  Oh, my God.  Would I be angered? 
[02:19:00]  And now take the left.  Let's listen to the last 15 seconds.  This is during the caper of Ocean's 15.  Yes, yes.  It's during caper music.  Everyone's like going in and out of doors.  Yes.  Everything's going to time out.  Pull the Porsche up into the sewer.  Yes.  They play movie music.  That's what it is.  Let me say hi to.  Thank you.  Have a good day, guys.  Thanks, Peter.  I don't know if I'm going to be listening to Lotus anytime soon.  Type in the hotline here for Steve Gorman of the Black Girls.  I don't know who it is.  He'll call here and defend his jam band.  Let's say hi to Jay in East Meadow. 
[02:19:30]  He's going to tell us about the Winter Circle.  Oh, East Meadow.  Very close.  We saw the Winter Circle while we were doing a little street view.  Virtual tour of Long Island.  Yes.  But you guys said it was a drugstore.  Jay's got more info on it.  Go ahead, Jay.  Yeah.  Hey, listen, Jay.  If you're not too busy during your gigs, you can go to the Winter Circle.  It's an over 40 swingers club.  What?  Is that what it is?  Oh, yuck.  Over 40?  Wow.  Over 40.  Why does it have to be over 40?  Exactly.  Big Labia.  We're going to name it Big Labia.  Over 40 swingers club. 
[02:20:00]  How fucking awful is that?  A lot of fun going on in there.  And Jimmy's Mr. fucking morals and standards.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I want, if I'm going to go fucking swing, I want someone under 40.  Yes.  I want to see a bunch of 48-year-old women.  I've had four children.  I'm really letting my hair fly.  I want to get fucking dropped dead already.  48-year-old Jewish women.  It's even better.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Jewish broads.  That doesn't do anything for me, though.  A bunch of old swingers.  Yeah.  All out of shape swingers.  And over 40, by the way.  They're not 40 in there.  It's over 40.  They're in their late 50s. 
[02:20:30]  You know, I'm a widower.  Yeah.  When Saul was alive, we'd fuck all day.  Let me tell you.  Finger sandwiches and then fuck all night.  My granddaughter told me, it's time I get back out on the scene.  Sue everybody.  Sue everyone.  Listen, we're going to go back to the swingers club in a second.  Over 40 swingers club.  But we've got Steve Gorman on the line, Jack.  Oh, Stevie.  Hold on a minute.  My friend from the Black Crows.  I just texted him and said, call Opie and Anthony. 
[02:21:00]  Steve Gorman.  Wonderful timing, JJ.  What happens?  This is the drummer of the Black Crows.  We were talking Opie and I, Steve Gorman, drummer for the Black Crows and Trigger Hippie.  We were talking about...  Well, first I want to say, welcome to our show.  And second, I want to say, I'm a huge fan of the Black Crows.  So this is pretty cool.  We used to talk to Chris Robinson and Rich back in the day, but it's been many years.  Well, thank you, sir.  It's nice to be here.  So you're the third founding member of the Black Crows on third. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  We were taking Gorman back in the day.  I've been trying to get Gorman to roll me Chris Robinson for two years.  It's the only reason I'm friends with him.  Oh, shit.  I'm trying to get Chris on my podcast.  The guy's a goddamn flake.  I'm doing you a favor, okay?  I'm acting as an effective buffer.  Can I ask you something?  Does Rich have like a four-year-old?  Yeah.  I thought it was him.  We went through a hospital tour when I was having my son almost four years ago here in  New York City. 
[02:22:00]  And all of a sudden, I'm like, Rich Robinson's also having a kid and going on the hospital  tour.  And no one else knew, though.  But I didn't want to be that guy, so I never said anything to him.  Did you say, see the body in its pristine state?  And I always wondered if it was him, because I'm like, that's crazy.  It looks just like him.  But maybe it's not him.  But now I know for sure it was.  Anyway.  Whatever.  Jay, why we got Steve Gorman on the line?  Oh, because we were talking about how much we love the Black Crows, and then you and  I both tapped out when they went jam-band.  I sort of tapped out, Steve, a little bit.  When you guys are putting the set list together, and there's like three 15-minute songs, do you 
[02:22:30]  ever pipe up and go, what the fuck are we doing with the Black Crows?  Why don't we do our songs?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I mean, you're talking about you tapping out.  Go back and listen to some of the tapes.  Just hold the basic beat.  Just hold a beat and fucking check your texts.  You know what?  I like it.  I like playing some of that stuff.  We definitely went to places that wasn't my idea, wasn't my favorite thing. 
[02:23:00]  But it comes back around eventually.  I mean, if you've got nothing else to do for 20 minutes, it's not a bad way to pass it.  I've never had a bad time at a Black Crows show, even when you guys did the long jams.  You're just saying that because it's on the line.  No.  I'll tell Gorman right to his face.  I love Lions.  I love all the songs.  There's like four albums.  There's not a dud on the entire album.  And you guys go into like, whoa, Mule, and I'm like, what the fuck is going on here? 
[02:23:30]  I like a good two-minute, 30-second hit.  Yeah, I don't hear Burrito 1 and Burrito 2.  Just make one burrito.  One burrito.  That's all we need.  Gorman, do you ever raise hell when you're in there now that you're on the other side?  I'm too old to care anymore.  There was a time, yeah.  They probably point and laugh and go, oh, the drummer, how cute.  He's got an opinion.  Would you care to know one of my favorite Black Crow songs?  I'm always interested in your thoughts on the Black Crow songs.  Thank you, sir.  I'm on the phone.  I'm going Black Moon Creepin'. 
[02:24:00]  Thank you.  You know what?  I got no problem with Black Moon Creepin'.  I love that song.  How about this?  Steve Gorman, drummer for the Black Crows, founding member of the Black Crows.  Third.  It's been on radio.  I'm working on radio now.  I know.  Here's the thing.  Got to reset.  It's called a reset.  Opie, when he toured with Jimmy Page, when the Black Crows toured with Jimmy Page, what  is your guess, because I know it, that Steve Gorman's favorite Led Zeppelin song was, where every night, when he sat behind the kit, went, I can't fucking believe I'm sitting here playing this song.  Stay away to heaven. 
[02:24:30]  Moby Dick.  You think Chris Robinson's going to let him do Moby Dick?  Oh, sorry.  I wouldn't let myself do Moby Dick.  No.  I don't know what song.  Cashmere.  Ten Years Gone.  No, no, no.  Oh, nice.  You guys got a version of Ten Years Gone?  Oh, yeah.  We might have to play that in its entirety after this thrilling interview.  Steve Gorman, what's your favorite bit of mine?  My favorite bit of Jay Morris?  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  You know, I mean, I hate to say it.  It's just I feel like I'm still a sucker for any Eddie Vedder.  Yeah.  Gets me.  Nice.  But when I saw Jay last year, my favorite bit was talking about Keith Richards finally hit his bottom.  Oh, when Keith Richards went to AA because he fell out of a coconut tree.  Right.  Oh, that's a great bit.  I hate to be in that meeting.  There's a lot of great.  There's a lot of great bits.  Did you rip your school pants?  I used to suck my dentist's dick for Vicodin.  Are we in the same room?  You fucking fell out of a tree, you five-year-old. 
[02:25:30]  I got a question for Steve Gorman.  Do you know who Opie and Anthony are?  I've heard vague references.  Vague references.  We're not even on the Black Crow's radar.  And we've had Chris and Rich on a few times.  When it was a tight, really concise show with real well-scripted bits.  That's going to warm up my vibe.  I hear you.  Gorman's funny, man.  You just got too loose.  I mean, I still dig where you're coming from.  But, you know, sometimes it goes on too long. 
[02:26:00]  We're the jam band of radio.  I got it.  They're on until 10.30 now, Steve.  You can totally fucking jam band it out.  He called you out.  You jam band it out.  This guy's getting us back.  Roland fucking texting me.  We're on until 10.30 now, too, JJ.  Well, we start at 6.30, though.  We didn't add time.  Whose fault is that?  Mine and Steve's?  Me and Steve are banging out the fucking hits off of Morica.  Where are you guys at with the band right now?  Are you guys touring?  Don't ask.  Uh-oh.  There's nothing going on right now.  We covered last year.  We're done. 
[02:26:30]  That's it.  What do you mean, we're done?  There's nothing.  We have nothing on the books for 14.  We're all doing other things.  What about 15, 16 through 3,000?  Nice.  I'll let you know in 15.  We don't plan ahead very well.  How is Kate Hudson on tour?  A dream.  There you go.  We loved her.  We had her in the corner in a studio in Boston when we were talking to Chris.  I did a movie with her, The 200 Cigarettes.  I know you did, Jay.  That's why I brought it up. 
[02:27:00]  Every van ride home to the hotel.  She goes, can we get sushi?  I love sushi.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  Of course.  This is L.A.  You can have whatever you want.  I'm a Jersey guy.  He's like, we got to get sushi, you guys.  Don't you guys love sushi?  No.  Anything you like that much is not your fucking child.  Have your head examined.  I think she's getting a little nutty, Steve Gorman.  I'll get your thoughts on this.  You know, you got a kid with Chris Robinson, and then like every goddamn boyfriend, two days  in, you got A-Rod carrying the kid across the street on his shoulders, then Lance Armstrong's 
[02:27:30]  carrying the kid across the street on his shoulders.  If you're Chris Robinson, you got to start whacking people.  Man.  I thought she was great in Titanic.  That's all I know.  Let me think about that.  She was great in Titanic.  Gorman's funnier than you think of.  I think it's hilarious.  What are you saying?  You told me under the bus.  I didn't hear the phone crapped out for a second.  So what are you doing in 2014?  I have two things going on.  I have my own radio show on the very network. 
[02:28:00]  They have Jay Moore's radio show.  Nice.  And then I have a band called Trigger Hippie that's finishing our first record.  We've been playing shows off the last few years, and we're going to be doing some very  significant touring in the second half of this year.  Very cool.  Joan Osborne, Jackie Green, Steve Gorman.  Who's the other guitarist?  Tom Bukovic.  Yeah, I never heard of him.  Maybe you will.  Greatest guitar player I've ever taken the stage with.  I like the song Turpentine. 
[02:28:30]  I'm a fan of it myself.  Very nice.  That was the first one he sent me like a year ago.  He goes, we just finished this, JJ.  Check this out.  Really?  We might have to play some Steve Gorman.  I thought I was stalling for it to come in.  Well, your phone's crapping out, Steve Gorman.  Way to go, Gorman.  My phone's crapping out?  Yeah.  That's why you're not a front man.  You don't understand.  I'm in the middle of things.  I get a text.  I call in and you're bitching.  He would fit in perfect with this show.  You ever get to New York? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, sporadically.  Several times a year.  You'll have to look us up.  Jerry, what are you doing?  Huh?  Where are you?  What's happening with you?  I'm in New York.  I'm doing some dates.  I'm doing Borgata tomorrow night.  Saturday, I'm at Foxwoods.  Sunday, I'm at a place that's over 40 swingers clubs.  That's down the street.  Oh, that's down the street.  I'm doing dates.  I took the rest of the week off.  Never mind.  So when you're in New York, you've got to come on O.P. and Anthony, Steve.  You guys will all hit it off perfect. 
[02:29:30]  And I'm very happy about it.  Give me 10% commission on all those laughs.  There you go.  All right.  Steve Gorman.  Thank you, Steve.  Dave, on the Progressive Insurance Celebrity Hotline.  You're listening to Jay Moore Sports.  Foxwoods, Eddie.  Insurance.  He hung up.  He wanted out.  No, he's a fun guy.  What do you want to play?  Ten Years Gone by the Black Crows?  Oh, yeah.  How long is it?  Six and a half.  Oh, shit.  One and one and one.  Let me hear this.  You know what he said?  I love parlous.  He hasn't played for a minute and a half.  So you have to actually sit there and look at people's faces in the crowd, right? 
[02:30:00]  It's so many starts.  Yeah.  We'll be back with Jay Moore's Jimmy Page with the Black Crows.  Ten Years Gone.  Yeah, they've been doing the flight simulator for like three weeks now on CNN.  They're doing all the scenarios that could have happened to the plane.  I like how they keep going back to it over and over again like it's a draft simulator.  Like they're going to get a different pick.  Something will happen. 
[02:30:30]  Fucking Blake Bortles fell to number eight.  This time it ran out of gas and landed in Perth.  I got only one sports question for you today because you know your sports.  Huh?  What?  My father-in-law is pushing hard for UConn.  What's their chances today?  Who do they play?  I don't even know.  That's what I know the least about.  What?  March Madness?  College basketball.  Is Jim Calhoun head coach?  No.  That I know.  He had some problems.  Oh yeah, he had cancer.  Calhoun had some problems. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Who do they play?  You don't mean you don't know who they play.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  You should have known.  Why does Tate's newspaper have the box score for the Lakers and Knicks from Tuesday?  I don't know.  I thought I was reading the wrong newspaper.  UConn's playing the Cyclones.  Iowa State?  Iowa State, right.  Fred Hoiberg.  I have no idea.  Mayor of Ames, Iowa.  Fred Hoiberg.  My father-in-law is begging me not to push for UConn because he really believes in my sports  cards.  Oh really?  Because I watched the last game with him and I was all in.  I want UConn. 
[02:31:30]  I can't stand college basketball.  I don't like it either.  What about Shabba?  Huh?  What?  Huh?  What?  Hey!  Huh?  What?  What about Shabba?  Yeah, you do a sports show, right?  Yeah.  Just making sure.  He said, what about Shabba?  What the fuck does that mean?  What about Shabba?  I think that's his name.  I don't know.  Or Shabba's.  Shabba.  There's a lot of Shabba's.  It's the guard for UConn.  How do you say his name? 
[02:32:00]  Shabba's.  Shabba's.  Shalom.  All right, Opie.  I don't know.  I'm not the sports guy.  You want to be the fucking guy?  I'll go down the road with you.  I don't know.  You want it?  Hold on.  What's his name?  Do you want it or not?  I don't want.  Well, I'm going to give it to you.  I don't want it.  UConn with Jim Calhoun.  Yeah.  Dedicated.  Determined.  Everybody's going to fucking class on time.  It's a guard-oriented team.  And that's what the tournament is.  I don't know.  Shut up.  You ass broke my ball.  Now you're going to get it.  But what about the seven-foot black center they always like to get?  Centers are fucking irrelevant. 
[02:32:30]  They like to get the really dark ones.  No one has ever won a tournament because of a center.  But UConn likes to get the really dark black center from Africa.  Jesus.  You should know this.  And Georgetown didn't?  True.  See, I'm just showing you.  I know a little bit, too.  The Kempe Mutombo sounded like Chewbacca.  That was a terrible Chewbacca.  There you go.  Chewbacca.  Napier.  Centers are completely irrelevant in tournaments.  He's not a center.  He's the guard.  Chewbacca.  Oh, you're talking about seven-footers.  Guards and coaches when it comes to the tournament. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  Iowa State.  A program.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Building, building, building.  Like, foundation.  You're going to build a house, have a good foundation.  Iowa State.  Fred Hoiberg.  Eh.  In the NBA.  Just a white guy that can drain the fucking three once in a while.  That is the better team.  Iowa State will beat UConn.  I don't get that.  You know why?  Because guys at UConn are sitting around watching TV holding their dicks.  And Iowa State, they can't get away with that.  How could a guard.  What about Napier?  How could a center not matter in, like. 
[02:33:30]  I'll tell you what.  I don't get it.  I'll tell you.  It's the same reason a center doesn't matter for an NBA championship.  To win a game with precious seconds on the clock, you have to have the ball in your hand.  You can't rely on somebody to have to get the ball into somebody else's hands.  Oh, okay.  If I'm standing down in a basket, I'm seven feet tall from fucking Cameroon, waving my  fucking hands around.  Yay!  Yo!  Down low, I'm open!  And the fucking guard's looking around, and the coach is yelling, we'll fucking play.  Look at any guy.  Like, LeBron James is 6'8", but he's still the guy with ten seconds. 
[02:34:00]  He's bringing the ball across the court.  You go coast to coast, or you can fucking dish it out at the last second.  Kobe, Magic Johnson, that's why the Knicks never fucking won.  They had to feed Patrick Ewing, and then he had to take 18 steps back and do a 20-foot  jump shot for some reason.  You're seven feet tall.  Dunk the fucking ball!  What about Phil Jackson and the Knicks?  Does he make the changes?  I think he just, everything's magical with Phil Jackson.  He just lowered the drinking age of Manhattan to 15.  He is the greatest. 
[02:34:30]  Yep, Statue of Liberty is wearing a thong.  Everything's good.  I don't like the Carmelo Anthony.  Great individual player, but I don't think the Knicks win championships with that guy.  The fact that he got Carmelo Anthony to say, if Phil Jackson can get me a championship,  because everything that I've done on my way has led me to here, meaning garbage,  the fact that he said that out loud is monumental.  That's promising.  I think you're right.  J.R. Smith is maybe the worst human being in the NBA.  He's got to be the number one gangster in the NBA. 
[02:35:00]  I don't know any gangster.  Literally, when you go to West 4th Street or Rucker Park, and you're like,  this guy fucking won't pass the ball.  There's that one guy when you're watching a pickup game.  Right.  That's J.R.  You're like, pass it, you dick.  I don't know much about basketball.  I know.  I don't watch as much as I used to.  I was pretty impressed, though, by Jay's prowess.  J.B., are you doing the cowhead roast?  Who's this cowhead guy?  I'm on it, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.  It's possible.  All right, we'll sign your info right here.  That was my segue, reading your actual. 
[02:35:30]  No.  No, you don't have to worry about it.  Wait, you're tapping out of the cowhead roast?  I don't know yet.  It's not that I'm tapping out of the roast, but I might have something else at night that  is unmovable.  Ralphie Mae.  Something big.  I was going to say E-Rock.  No, is he going to be there?  We're not on good terms with Ralphie Mae.  I don't know why.  He doesn't know why either.  He was just on my podcast.  I think it's Anthony.  We talked about it.  Things fell apart.  Things fell apart.  What do you want from me?  He's exaggerating saving our careers.  What do you want from me?  I like Ralphie Mae, but that day we pushed it and made it sound like, yeah, he really 
[02:36:00]  saved our careers, but he really didn't.  It was more of a bit.  Yeah, I think he built it up.  And I heard Anthony's impression of Ralphie Mae.  Well, it's kind of a little screamy.  I never heard him scream, but he just talks.  He tends to get a little screamy when we were.  I know you love Ralphie Mae.  I mean, I'll call a spade a spade.  I have no issues with Ralphie Mae.  But he does exaggerate the day that we almost got fired.  I will say this.  If you're talking about a guy that's an actual good guy, Ralphie's a good guy, right? 
[02:36:30]  He's a great guy.  And if you're talking about a guy that if you put him in a room, a stand-up comedy club,  and he'll just get a guaranteed money in the bank, you'll never not destroy.  He's the guy.  He's the best.  He's a first-rounder.  Should we call him and smooth it over?  Call him right now.  We got Mindy coming in.  Mindy Kaling?  Yeah.  From the Mindy Project?  Mm-hmm.  In the book, Are You Guys Having Fun Without Me?  Mm-hmm.  This is Harvey Keitel.  He was very well versed in Mindy Kaling.  She is from another country. 
[02:37:00]  Respect it.  Respect all the mores of her society.  If she comes in here and wants to eat with her fucking hands, you accommodate it.  If she wants to wave her hands around as a cinder for UConn, you will let her do it.  I don't give a shit if she's from Cameroon.  Leave it on the Mets.  Should I leave it on the Mets?  Leave it on the Mets.  Dodgers are a fucking lock.  Here's Mindy right here.  Do you do the Harvey Keitel crying? 
[02:37:30]  Because him crying is hilarious.  You're going to be okay.  Do you do those?  He cries and hallucinates Christ and calls Jesus a rat fuck.  Naked.  And then he's naked.  He goes, oh, you rat fuck.  That's it.  Where the fuck were you?  I'm so bad.  I'm sorry. 
[02:38:00]  You rat fuck.  Because Jesus of all people.  You're all in with the Jesus too, J-Man.  That's great.  How's that going?  It's going well for you?  Well, I was never out.  I was raised Presbyterian.  I'm not a heathen.  I'm not a heathen.  I'm not Ken Gillette.  I thought you were Catholic.  Yeah, I converted him.  And hates the Lord.  Oh, you did?  But I was always raised in the church.  Good for you.  I like it.  Yes, I am. 
[02:38:30]  I'm all in.  It speaks to you.  Gentlemen.  Yes, sir.  Tomorrow.  Borgata.  Saturday.  Foxwoods.  Exactly.  May...  What is it?  April 5th?  April 5th.  The place that's not even up yet?  Westbury.  The My Space at Westbury.  The Space.  Let's get Mindy in here.  I'll see you guys Monday, maybe?  What are you doing?  Jay Moores.  I'm going to go.  Oh, okay.  You know what it is?  When I'm in with somebody else, I suck everything out of the room.  Oh, Jay.  Oh, we wouldn't say that.  Oh, my God.  You guys are dicks. 
[02:39:00]  You know what?  We wouldn't say that, Jay.  The kid's got a half hour of your time.  Why am I going to cut into it?  Okay, let's get Mindy in here.  See, now you're going to work.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Fuck you and fuck Michael Jackson.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry.  The great Jay Moores.  That's Jay Moores.  Thank you, Jay.  Thank you, boys.  We'll see maybe, what, Monday, you said?  Sounds great.  Take it easy.  All right.  He loves that number 37, too.  Certainly does.  Take a seat.  All right.  Hi, Mindy.  I'm right here. 
[02:39:30]  That's good.  That's where Jay Moores was sitting.  Is it warm?  Is it uncomfortably warm?  Jay Moores is kind of hot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Digging on Jay?  Adult blonde men.  You don't see that that often.  No.  It's kind of a creepy teen look.  No matter what goes on.  That is true.  Adult blonde men.  Blonde men.  Well, you're kind of blonde.  Thank you, Mindy.  You're reddish blonde?  I'm not an adult yet, though.  I came on strong like I'm a pervert.  I'm a normal girl.  No, we understand.  I don't jump out to cheeky at every guy in the morning.  That's not pervert.  That's actually nice.  No, it's true.  When you come in and think a gentleman is good looking. 
[02:40:00]  That's not dirty.  It's pleasant.  It's nice.  That could be a cultural thing, too, though.  You know.  Well, the opposite of a dark-haired, darker-skinned gentleman.  Anthropologically, you're saying I'm like finding the opposite.  And I'm like.  Exactly.  Yeah, I thought that's true.  Yeah.  That actually, that kind of makes sense.  It probably does.  I wouldn't know.  Do you go for blonde guys typically?  Well, here's the thing.  If you ask most women, and if they're like.  The woman who says they don't go for a blonde man is like a liar.  Because like anybody, that's like a nice looking.  Nice, right? 
[02:40:30]  Ten dollar, right?  And the blue eyes help, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I have no preference for hair color.  I don't care at all.  Like if it's a blonde, none of it matters to me.  Male, female.  Well, you know, sometimes you kind of, you settle in the middle.  That's very feminist of you.  You're like, I'll take a beautiful woman in any hair color.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because it's the attitude that makes somebody sexy.  It's like, you know what I mean?  I've seen a lot of really like stripper hot people that are not sexy people at all.  And a sense of humor.  I don't care about that either.  I want them to think I'm funny, but I'm typically, laughing doesn't turn me on. 
[02:41:00]  No, you don't like a funny girl?  I love a funny girl, but it doesn't mean I'm going to be sexy.  You're out.  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, that's not a thing that will excite me sexually, but I appreciate that they have  it.  Mm-hmm.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah, totally.  I swear to that.  Yeah.  Do you ever do stand-up?  God, I tried it for a while.  I don't know, even because you guys are all like really funny.  But I did that thing where I saw people doing it.  This is terrible.  You should never be motivated to do it because it's really an art.  But like, you see people who suck and people kind of compliment them and you're like, I 
[02:41:30]  can suck too.  Right, right, right.  Why don't I go do it?  But you should never be motivated out of spite.  And so I quickly give up because I'm not good at it.  So where did you see people that were just awful?  You know, it's, okay, so I will say this.  There's this nice kind of, it's coming from a really good place of reverse sexism where  like, I feel like a woman will do stand-up and people will be like, she's really hilarious.  And you're like, it's just like so that people can feel like it's whatever.  And so I felt like I was kind of motivated in this bad way of like, well, if the bar 
[02:42:00]  is set low and I'm like, no, no, no.  Everyone's like a genius.  She's super funny.  You shouldn't do it if you're, unless you're really good and you really put in the time  to like, because it's hard work.  Like you have to, like, you have to work really hard to get, I think, good.  I mean, unless you're like Chappelle or Louis C.K. where like everything they say, it  just sounds like an amazing conversation.  I think it just, I think the time that you have to put in is so long and you know that  it's going to be a painful couple of years before you even get close to being any good. 
[02:42:30]  And that is like, oh.  And eating it, like, I mean.  Just sucking it, right.  Just the pain of eating it, like going to coffee shops and Reseda and practicing your  bits and like, I mean, that seems like you have to be a really like tough.  Yeah, I couldn't imagine because I know like my buddy Joe Curry started out like, and with,  I mean, the minimum.  Right.  And to sit there and sometimes you're in a pizza place and all of a sudden you hear,  hey, and let's bring up, what?  What?  I didn't even know if someone was going to be here.  Where are they going to be? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, it's barely a venue.  Yeah, yeah.  I suppose that we're an audience now.  What?  They do comedy here?  That's so funny.  Yeah, I just wanted a slice and now I'm an audience member.  Now I have to listen to these terrible observations.  Guys insulting your shirt and fucking your outfit, your wife.  Who are you?  I would instantly want to go to like a name club and get up and do time there.  I don't want to have to go through that horrible time where you're working a real job to live  and then you're doing this to try to make something of yourself. 
[02:43:30]  Fuck that.  Did you bomb?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, the thing about me was I think that I have no, I mean, here's the thing.  If you're a stand-up, the kind of stand-up I like, like I said, Chappelle, Louis C.K.,  they are just talking about stuff that's interesting to them.  And clearly they work and they craft jokes, but they're smart and their brains are really like turned on and whatever.  But I was just like, I didn't want to open up that much about my life because like Louis can talk about marriage as kids. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  Chappelle, he has so many cool demons and numbers.  Like I didn't have honestly enough that I could like, I wasn't introspective enough.  I didn't want the audience to know that much about me.  And so it sucked.  So when I'd bomb, I'd bomb because people were like, well, we don't even know who you are.  Carlin, though, I didn't, you know, Pryor was the guy who let you in on everything.  But Carlin, who was one of the greatest ever, never really did.  Like he was like, like kind of a guy just kind of standing on the sidelines, just attacking everybody.  Yeah.  You didn't know much about him.  You're right.  He's never talking about his personal life. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  So those guys, they're like, if you're not going to let yourself in and you don't have that connection,  you need to be like a masterful joke writer.  Or in Carlin's case, like his opinions are so well-researched and smart.  Yeah.  Because that's a guy who's like, he's not just like talking about politics.  He's like read about it and like.  Yeah, you have to be very socially aware.  But Mindy, you don't have a good backstory or you just like to be very private?  I think I'm ultimately a pretty private person, which no one guesses for me because of like  my show or like the fact that I, I'm like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like 
[02:45:00]  talking a lot.  But yeah, like I'm always like, I don't want to like, I don't want my parents to be like  ashamed.  You know, like why?  I stopped worrying about that in 1991 because I started talking about certain things.  I'm like, if they ever see my act, it's going to be humiliated.  We messed that up a long time ago.  But in success, you guys have become like, if you can, you can be successful about doing  that, then they're like, ah, we're proud again.  Because it's like you're, if you do it at such a high level, it's so cool, actually.  Well, your parents, they like what you do?  They love it. 
[02:45:30]  They, they, they really do love it.  It's weird.  Like we didn't have any performers in my family, but they loved comedy.  My parents would, like, all we would do is go for long drives to Virginia Beach from  Boston.  Because I think like Indian families would go for like long, weird drives that are like  15 hours long.  And we would just listen to like comedy albums.  So they really appreciated it.  And I guess it's kind of like stand up is like kind of an American art form when you're  Indian immigrants.  It's like really interesting to you.  Yeah.  So we would do that.  And they love comedy and they love The Office. 
[02:46:00]  They love Corral.  But, um.  Who did they love as a stand up, your parents?  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld, they adored.  Because in general too, like he was pretty clean.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Um, but they also like, I remember my, I would, they would, when I first moved to LA, I was  like, you've got to watch the Chappelle show, which is sketches, not stand up, but they  like, they love Chappelle.  I think kind of like racially in my family, like we had this like kind of unspoken thing  where we're just like, we like just love black comedians too.  Cause when I was a kid, Bill Cosby stand up too.  Cause he's so moral, which I think my parents connected to as well. 
[02:46:30]  Like the way he's, he's really high, sets a really high bar for how you should be as  like a husband and a dad.  And like, I think like it was funny.  So my parents thought that was cool.  Great storyteller.  Such a storyteller.  His storytelling is second to none.  And that's one, but Louie's also great at that.  The ability to keep you interested as he just walks through a story, no matter what the  information is, I lose people five minutes.  Like I've learned to get to the fucking point because I lose people fast.  Like, but Louie can just keep people for 20. 
[02:47:00]  Jim Brewer can do that.  There's certain guys that can hold your interest for a long period of time.  Oh, I should watch Jim Brewer.  Cause I, I only of course know his stuff from SNL.  Oh, Brewer's a great standup.  Yeah.  His standup's amazing.  Is that how he got on SNL?  Is it from standup?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  He's been a standup his whole life, but I just saw him recently.  He does like five, six stories.  That's his whole set.  That to me is the best.  But the jokes are in there the whole time.  That to me is, is the best.  Oh, then you got to see Brewer next time he's around you.  He's great.  Yeah, I should.  How many times did you do it?  Standup?  Yeah.  I'd say like six times.  Once I did it at like Notre Dame and like some, I feel like it was like a big football 
[02:47:30]  weekend and it was like, I, cause here's the other thing about standup.  I have my guy friends, you know, BJ and all that who do standup and they love it.  Part of the reason when you're in your twenties and you do standup is because of all the action  you can get from college girls.  And so you're like psyched to do it.  And then you go party and you hook up and it's the funnest weekend ever.  But I'm like, like a home, like what the fuck am I going to do?  Like, I'm not going to like go of a great, I can hook up with a 19 year old guy.  It's like, I'm like, I'm worried about getting murdered.  Like there's no upside really for me. 
[02:48:00]  So I just go back to my like weird hotel and watch cable and fall asleep.  So it was a very depressing experience.  I did the same thing.  I never hooked up with the college girls because the acting, you, I don't know.  But that's the question I asked many times in the mirror in the hotel bathroom alone  as a prostitute was on our way over.  It's humiliating.  And I was struck out terribly in colleges.  Really?  Yeah.  You need a certain like, like an actor, a personality that they would kind of lock into.  But do they like your act?  Yeah, we go.  Okay.  I never killed in colleges.  I think you weren't going to the right place. 
[02:48:30]  You probably, no, I did enough of them where I just, I was too dirty or I was too mean.  And I just, I kind of stopped doing, they just stopped asking for me.  Like I did one like convention, not a lot of interest.  No.  Nah, not a lot of interest.  I'm so surprised to hear that.  I find acting to be harder than stand-up.  A lot of people say stand-up, but I find acting to be harder because you have to stay  in the scene.  You can't break it and say this stinks if it stinks.  I think you're absolutely right that acting is very hard.  I feel like because I write my show and because I'm like allowed as like the writer creator 
[02:49:00]  to just like make up lines, it's like very easy.  Also, like my character is not, I'm like disappearing into a part.  I'm like doing a kind of a version of myself, a character named Mindy.  Yeah, right.  Do you change stuff from like take to take?  You'll just switch lines?  Not that much because I think the other actors in your scenes get annoyed if they don't know  what you're going to say, if not everyone's in improv.  But like Barron Holtz, who is another comedian, he's a writer on the show, he and I improvise  a lot because he, it's weird, like in a show, like you can only improvise if like he 
[02:49:30]  knows where the storylines are going.  So he has like an idea of like what areas you can improvise.  Yeah, you can't just take it somewhere completely off.  You just can't take it in like another direction.  Off script.  But in general, like the best stuff, the best shows, like I look at like Raymond and stuff,  they're generally not improvised.  No.  You know, like Seinfeld wasn't improvised.  That was scripted to T.  Yeah, right.  So if those guys were like the greats, don't, don't depend on it, then like, I feel like  why am I...  Well, then you got to look though, Seinfeld wasn't very successful. 
[02:50:00]  That's true.  No, no, no, he did well.  Oh, yeah.  The guy who ruins a fun, sarcastic moment.  No, no, no, seriously.  I'm kidding aside.  That was, he was good.  The original authors too, I always thought that Gervais, I thought so much of that had to  be improvised or had to be off the cuff.  And he said it was all scripted.  It was so brilliantly done.  Some of the stuff, like, there's no way they could have scripted that moment.  It was too, like, alive and scripted.  Those little awkward moments where somebody looks, literally looks like they're tripping  up and it's, it was written. 
[02:50:30]  You know, that's brilliant to me, yeah.  Well, especially in, if you guys, did you see all of the original?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course.  I think that's like a perfect series, but the moment when Tim takes off his microphone.  Oh, yeah.  And it's just, I think it's also the quality of the mockumentary which makes you feel like,  how could it be scripted?  It's so real.  But when he takes that off and walks in, it's like, I'd never seen anything like that  before.  And so, it, when you find out how tightly scripted Stephen and Ricky did it, it's, it's kind  of crazy.  So moving.  Yeah, and they're all such great actors.  I love when he, in the second episode, I think, when he's just trying to be funny, and 
[02:51:00]  I've told him this, just trying to be funny with this new girl at the office, and he does  the thing with the answering machine.  Oh, yeah.  Do you remember that?  When he just, he mock throws it, and he drops it on the floor?  Yes, yes.  And it's like, oh, what a, what a perfectly douchey thing to do.  They're like, there's no way that was scripted.  Do you remember that one scene that he did where he was doing the, he was feeling very  competitive, and he was doing the, they were talking about, like, we always looked at  it in the office as like our favorite moment when he was talking about the hypothetical thing 
[02:51:30]  that happened, and he said, there's been a rape up there.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were like, they were trying to, his whole thing was he was trying to tell his employees,  teach them about it, and he, and it was like, why would you improvise that at that moment?  It's just so funny.  Well, he was so great, because the guy was in, in, in the, their office that day, trying  to teach them, like, certain things about being successful in business, but Gervais couldn't  handle that this guy, so he made it a competition and worked against the guy, and it was  like, and then they switched roles, and the guy's like, and Ricky Gervais played the guy 
[02:52:00]  behind the counter, and he's like, there's a problem in my room, he goes, what's your  room number?  And the guy's like, three, five, seven, he goes, there is no three, five, seven.  That was so, that was one of those things where, like, that, that kind of improv, that  was so, that was so well observed of Ricky Gervais, like, that was such a funny, that,  that guy who's just terrible at improv and yes-handing, it was so brilliant.  And you have to be so good at what you do to make it seem like that, to make it seem  so naturally awkward. 
[02:52:30]  This is not just, like, reminiscing about The Office, but one thing I thought was really  funny on that show was he was always the person who was offending everybody, but what  was so good about David Brent was when he would get frustrated with somebody else, like, remember  that guy Keith, and there was, like, that long scene where he's trying to, like, talk to  him, and, like, David Brent, for once, is being put upon, and he's usually the one that's,  like, bothering other people, and he's just so exquisitely impatient, like, and he was  doing the evaluations, he was, like, my God, who is this idiot, and I feel like we tried 
[02:53:00]  with Kevin, because that's such a fun, because Corral being a patient, too, was so fun.  Yeah.  When he just couldn't, like, he couldn't handle the people of the, you know, in the workplace.  Did you?  He's also, I'm sorry, he's also a prude.  Like, David Brent was a prude.  Yeah.  Like, he didn't like sex jokes.  Really?  That's true?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, but in the show, he didn't like, he goes, that is sexist.  He didn't like sex jokes, or any type of vulgar stuff.  Like, he was a prude.  Oh, that's so funny.  Yeah.  I didn't remember, I haven't really.  Did you watch all of the original before you started doing, you did? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  I mean, I was just, like, the detail, a little still, the video he did, we spent all of his  savings on doing the remake of the If You Don't Know Me By Now video.  Like, just, he was such a, like, it's interesting, because Ricky's so brilliant, and so wonderful,  and the character was so heartbreaking, and then what was so great about Corral, it was  like, Corral did something different, which was like, Corral, like, he's a little warmer  than Ricky.  I feel like he exudes, like, a warmth about him, where, like, you feel sorry for Ricky, 
[02:54:00]  but for Steve, I felt, maybe just because this is just because we did so many more episodes,  you got to know him even more.  I wanted to protect Michael, and I feel like Jim wanted to protect him, where, even by  the episode of the end, I felt like Tim, the Tim character in Ricky Gervais, he grew to  admire him, but didn't want to, like, I felt like Jim at the end of The Office, Pam, like,  no, they didn't want anyone to hurt Michael, which was kind of a nice thing about having  a series on the air for nine seasons.  Yeah, kind of explore all angles and personality.  Did you know Patrice? 
[02:54:30]  Wow.  A little bit.  Oh, okay.  I was very intimidated by him, because...  Well, he made people feel comfortable and welcomed.  I got the sense that I was, like, always, like, one or two sentences away from his, like,  an exquisitely mean rant he'd go on.  You know, like...  You did know Patrice.  You described him perfectly.  He'd be like, hey, Patrice, like, do you want to go to Crafty?  And he was like, I'm fat?  What are you trying to say?  And then you were, like, eviscerated.  And you're like, I can't believe I offered him to Crafty?  Oh, that's funny, man.  That's our pal, man.  That was him. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, he was on...  That's how I heard about The Office originally.  Like, before I...  I think I saw...  I knew Patrice was on that show before I even saw the British version.  He was a softie in the end, man.  Yeah.  He was intimidating, but when you got in, it was nice.  He was?  Yeah, he was a little good guy.  He did the show a million times.  Yeah.  Jimmy was very close to him and brought him into our arena.  But he was just loud.  We all became friends.  Super funny.  Oh, one of the best.  You're nice to your fans, too.  I was reading your Twitter, and I'm like, she's just a nice person.  Like, I...  I'm not.  I'm, like, terrible.  Oh, really?  You're just a great actress?  Well, I'm, like, fearful.  I'm fearful.  So, like, fearful of this makes you nice sometimes, but I'm... 
[02:55:30]  Thank you for saying that.  I should have just accepted the compliment.  I'm sorry.  What were you saying about how nice I was?  No, that's okay.  I like the fact that, like, as a true performer, we never want to be told that we're nice.  And if someone says you're not nice, you go, what the fuck?  Of course I'm not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But what happened with people waiting outside to meet you, like, on 6th Avenue, and they  couldn't meet you?  I did a signing outside of a store on 6th Avenue with a strand in Club Monaco.  It was for my book.  And I thought...  It was two hours supposed to do this training, but it was incredibly cold yesterday.  In L.A., it's, like, 70 degrees, but it was, like, 25 degrees. 
[02:56:00]  And all these girls, because that's who really likes me and writes my book and stuff,  these 21-year-old girls, whatever, were waiting for three and a half, four hours.  Wow.  And there's too many people for that amount of time.  I stayed an extra hour inside and stuff.  And I left, and, like, apparently, this to me, is, like, if I had been that age and this  had happened to me, I'd be so fucking pissed.  Like, imagine waiting for three and a half, four hours, and then being told when you're  within shots that, like, I left.  Hmm.  And I just, I had to go to something else afterwards, because it's, like, a packed press 
[02:56:30]  tour.  And so people were tweeting on me.  And I was, like, if I was that age, and I was such a big fan, I would actually make  me actively hate the show.  So I felt like I wanted to connect with those people and just be, like, I'm so sorry.  So I've been trying to, like, I, you know, tried to message some of those guys and send  them a signed book, or I have some, like, stuff back in L.A. that my assistant can, like,  send them.  But it sucks, because, you know, we're not a hit show, so anybody who, like, is going to  do that, like, it just made me feel really bad. 
[02:57:00]  Well, you know, it was really, because it was, they should have cut the line.  That's not your fault.  I mean, somebody should have went out there and said, look, she won't make it past this,  and they should have just stopped letting people line up.  That's what they usually do, right?  Yeah, normally.  I don't think they were expecting how popular I would be.  Yay!  But she was tweeting nice stuff, like, hey, send me, tweet me your address or whatever,  and then delete, like, you know, so I guess you could get stuff to them, which I thought  was really nice.  Well, first I said, like, hey, tweet me your address so I can send something, and then I was, like,  oh, no, these poor young women are sending their addresses to some serial murderers.  She was, like, quickly delete that.  I'll direct message you.  Yeah, that really probably wasn't the safest thing. 
[02:57:30]  I know.  I'm just, like, now I've put them in danger, and in addition to making them mad.  You tweet your address and a nude photo, and then just, like, send me your information,  and I'll make sure I get something to you.  I'm feeling responsible for 20 murders of young women moving to the city to make it.  Were you an improv actress before you started, or did you just start right with traditional acting?  I was never really an improv actor, or I didn't have any training.  The training I had, which was excellent training, was just, like, watching Steve Carell for, like,  16 hours a day for eight years, which would make anyone kind of a good actor. 
[02:58:00]  Because, you know that, you guys ever see Waiting for Guffin?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know that Eugene, there's this Eugene Levy character who's just, like, he's just, like,  I was not the funny guy, but I sat next to him, and I studied him, which was, I think,  such a self-aware, funny thing to say.  And that's how I felt.  I was, like, I was number 14 on the call sheet on that show, and I would watch, like,  Helms, Carell, like, Will Ferrell came by, your guy's friend Patrice, Craig Robinson,  who's so funny. 
[02:58:30]  And once you get this cadence, and you're just exposed to it, like, it's like going to acting  school.  Because Carell is going to, he comes from Chicago, he's an incredible improviser, and he can't  turn it off.  So he'll improvise with you, and you just kind of, like, baptism by fire.  And you guys are all writers, so if you're a funny writer, you probably, at one point,  were like, I could be in front of the camera.  And, of course, I felt that way.  And then I just got the experience to do it.  And you got named one of the times, what year was it that they named you on the 100 most  influential? 
[02:59:00]  That was last year.  That was last year.  And what was their reasoning for it?  What was their reasoning for it?  No, no, no, I don't mean that in a shitty way.  You're like, I was so surprised.  No, no, no.  I don't mean that.  I was dubious.  I don't mean it like that.  I'm saying that's a tremendous thing to get named.  No, it's too much.  I mean, you guys are in comedy, and it's like you want to be told you're funny, but when  it's almost like if you get overpraised, immediately you're like, oh, man, this fucking backlash.  Oh, what'd I do?  I was saying, like, I was on the list with, like, surgeons and people who are, like, you  know, like religious figures. 
[02:59:30]  Let them get on stage or in front of the cameras.  Exactly.  The laughter is the best medicine.  So, a person I know, and you look like this idiot where, like, you feel like you submitted  to do it.  I remember when it happened, and I knew it, too, because I'm such a, like, cynical comedy  person where I'm like, great, backlash.  I couldn't enjoy it, of course.  The minute it happened, LA Times next week, some fucking editor was like, Mindy Kaling  is considered, what has our culture become?  Oh, boy.  I was just saying, like, hey, man, that's not, like, obviously I didn't, I agree with you. 
[03:00:00]  Right.  I didn't run for this.  I didn't run for this, and I was like, my publicist has admitted me for this, but it  was, which is such an ungrateful way of saying, like, it was such an honor, and at the same  time, I was, like, I was very self-conscious about it.  How annoying is it that they would write the editorial?  As a performer, you never, like, you read the negative stuff, it's hard to avoid it.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I feel, I'm so into feedback, which is something that I want to quell in my personality,  but, you know, I was saying this earlier, it was like, I want our show to be a hit show,  and largely the stuff that I love, like, Raymond, those shows, they're hit shows, like, the 
[03:00:30]  stuff that lasts the test of time, sometimes they suck, but in general, like, even those  comedies, I was like, yeah, the biggest hits were kind of the best shows, so for me, I'm  like, how do I get to that place, so of course I read feedback, but the problem is, is that  it has to be, like, worthy, like, people calling me, like, like, they, like, you know, they  call me, like, a terrorist, or, like, whatever racist bullshit they want to say, I have to,  like, sift through that to get the point where they're, like.  Sift through that stuff.  Sift through that stuff.  Sift through that stuff. 
[03:01:00]  Sift through that stuff.  Sift through that stuff.  Unfortunately, that all comes together.  That's a great point.  That really is a great point.  So it's like, you want feedback, but you have to get it from, like...  You've got to cut the fat to get to the meat of it.  Everyone didn't used to have such a public voice in the old days, you know?  Platforms, yeah.  Yeah, we talk about it all the time, how if you were on television or movies or anything,  someone had to sit down and write a letter and mail it, and hopefully, you know, somebody  that screened the mail, if it got through them, it went to someone else. 
[03:01:30]  The celebrity never really got to look at a lot of negativity.  Now it's...  Hey, Twitter!  Bam!  Oh, my God!  These monsters!  What a great point, because if you had to write a letter, you have to have sustained  hostility to finish a letter, steal it, find the address.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whereas, like, a teenager right now could be like, you're so ugly, you should kill yourself.  Bam!  On Instagram.  It's out.  It's there.  Maybe, like, later in the afternoon, when you're not in detention, you might not have  wanted to say that to me.  You know, I caught her in a different light, and she looked pretty good. 
[03:02:00]  See, I actually guessed that, but I put that under constructive.  That's actually helpful.  But, yeah, it's really weird, because there are people that say stuff that's critical,  that makes sense, and that I don't find to be just trolling or douchey, like, even if  I don't like it.  Yeah.  And, like, then when you blast the haters, they're like, you can't take it.  It's like, no, you're not being constructive.  There is a difference.  Yeah.  There really is.  One of the things that hurts the most is when, like, when someone, especially if it's  somebody who I know has good taste, like, there's this one guy on Twitter who, like, 
[03:02:30]  loves some of the shows that I love, and he's able to articulate it in a way which is,  like, exactly the way I would like it.  Oh, no.  He doesn't like the show, and it kills me.  It's like, but you like this.  I know, I know.  You should like this.  You like Veep.  I like Veep.  We would be friends.  You know what?  I'm sure Hitler liked vanilla ice cream, too.  Thank you for putting it into perspective like that.  Yeah, I mean, I find the same thing.  They like certain things, and then they just, they hate my guts.  But just because we have certain similar likes doesn't mean that they're going to like me. 
[03:03:00]  That's true.  It's amazing how much they can like the things, and it hates my guts.  What are your guys' favorite shows when you watch TV?  Like, when you, because you're so busy.  My favorite, Martian.  No, Taxi, I think, is my favorite.  Taxi are all in the family, the two best sitcoms, I think.  Okay, so I'm obsessed with Taxi.  Yes, amazing.  So I started Christmas-y and I'm obsessed with it.  And the reason I love it so much, besides the storytelling, is that you had unbelievably  broad characters.  Yep.  And then you had Judd Hirsch, who could be in like a drama.  Yeah.  And they coexisted in this world, so like you could like anything and you'd be able to find 
[03:03:30]  it.  And I felt like, when I looked at that show at The Office, we were like, okay, we have  John Krasinski, who's so dry.  But then we also have Kevin, who's like, you know, Michael, Michael, I eat the moon.  Like, he's like a very broad comedy character.  I love that, Chad.  Yeah, it's really, the stuff that they did.  And I love when Louie gets, he fucks Xena's friend.  Do you remember when he took Xena's friend home in a cab and she was on pills and he wound  up fucking her?  It was just so great that that was the storyline, was that his girlfriend's friend was on pills 
[03:04:00]  and drunk and he banged her.  You can't do that nowadays.  You can't do that nowadays.  No.  Unfortunately.  They voted him.  That edgy stuff was hilarious.  And it's just not, you know, because people would say you contribute to rape culture if  you did that.  Which, by the way, is good that we're not contributing to rape culture.  No, but I wouldn't think that was a contributing thing to it.  Like, I don't think that humor really contributes to a certain...  No.  Believe me, what did Carlin say if, you know, something about changing the condition, people  think about changing the language to change the condition?  It just doesn't...  I think with comedy, I think it's all about context. 
[03:04:30]  And I really think there isn't many, there aren't many subjects you can't use in comedy.  And in that case, I find it kind of insulting when people say, oh, you shouldn't do that  or shouldn't joke about that.  I don't see anything that should be off limits, really.  I mean, obviously, people are going to be offended, but, you know, I think we should  be able to joke about anything.  If you make it funny, especially, right? 
[03:05:00]  It's interesting, because I think that I agree with you, but I'd also say that I think  sometimes comedians can be very lazy because they take an area that's just taboo.  I'm going to say it can suck.  I mean, people can get on service, and it'll suck, but I don't think it just has to suck  because of the subject.  I think how they tackle the subject is why it sucks.  There are horrible things that people make jokes about that it's like, oh my God, you  almost feel guilty laughing, but you are laughing.  And it's because it's done so well. 
[03:05:30]  So I don't think it's so much the subject matter as the horrible way people go about  trying to make a joke about it.  Yeah, it's all about execution.  The lazy part is what?  Is just kind of going after a subject just to do it.  Here's what I'll say.  You get a lot of attention by doing that.  And sometimes people laugh because of the audacity of it, which is not an earned laugh.  And I notice women fall into this trap a lot, female stand-ups, where I feel like they're  like, oh, it's interesting if I'm just like, I got raped yesterday, guys, and everyone laughed.  Everyone laughed.  Everyone laughed because they couldn't believe an attractive woman would say it. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  If you're a joke writer and you have spent your life in the trenches sitting around jokes,  and you're like, you can't just go up there and wear makeup and say, make a joke, just  say abortion.  That doesn't mean you're funny.  Right.  You know?  And the worst thing is like Sarah, who is an exquisite joke writer, not to throw the  word exquisite around twice in the half an hour, but she's an amazing joke writer and  she'll write a joke in an edgy area that is actually like a joke.  And the watered-down version of that, to me, kind of sucks.  I also, maybe I'm a prude, because I worry about young women who get into comedy, too, 
[03:06:30]  who use that as their calling card, because men are going to get titillated by that.  And I just want to be like, no, they're not interested in you for the reason you think  they are.  I think that goes away.  We have to wrap with Mindy, but...  Oh, man.  No, no, no, that's your...  They see you have another interview to do.  Okay.  You're really interesting.  And it's Mindy...  No, for real.  Thanks, guys.  We really like the time.  On Twitter, and the Mindy Project is Tuesday at nine o'clock on Fox, and there's an all-new 
[03:07:00]  one-hour spring premiere, episode nine.  Oh, episode 9pm.  Okay.  Spring...  That was really...  This is one long run-on sentence, and I'm butchering the plug, like the no-talent fucking shitbag  I am.  It's an all-new...  It's a small, not even worth mentioning type mistake.  I know, but a small but critical error.  Episode nine o'clock.  And did you want to...  We have a huge fan of yours here.  Did you want to ask a question?  Oh.  Dan, just get to the mic real quick, because she has to go.  You have to get to the microphone.  You have to get to the microphone. 
[03:07:30]  How fun.  Come over there.  Hi.  How are you?  There's a mic right there.  Wow.  Do you want to ask a question?  Yeah.  Because...  Hey, what's your name?  I'm Zannie Branch.  Hey, nice to meet you.  You're like my favorite person.  Wow.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I guess I don't really have a specific question.  Are you going to write another book?  I am.  Yeah, I'm working on it right now.  It's just long, angry essays and how unfairly I feel like I've been treated when I haven't  been truly.  That kind of thing. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, that kind of thing.  I think...  It's a good topic.  I want to ask you guys about more of the shows you like.  I love talking about...  It's so easy to hate on stuff, but I love hearing...  Come back and see us, man.  Which is...  So you like Taxi, which is a show about 40 years ago.  I like Taxi.  I like Mass.  Even though the humor on Mass, to me, doesn't really hold up as much.  Mm-hmm.  But the serious, awful moments hold up.  I'll watch Seinfeld 8,000 times a night, because I think that's how many times it's on.  Yes.  And the same episode over and over.  I'll laugh at the same spots.  I don't know why, but that is just an amazing show.  Cadences on that show are exactly what you want to see before you go to bed, I believe. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, it is.  You know, you're like, oh, this is like a lulling me.  It's funny.  The world is gone and I can sleep now.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm a huge fan of the Brady Bunch.  Okay, guys.  I am, too.  The most recent show was on 19 years ago.  20 years ago.  But only the Cousin Oliver years.  I know, right?  When Cousin Oliver came, it really brought it home.  Really.  When Alice and Sam had their relationship.  That's when it got kind of headed.  That is true.  Mr. Brady made his announcement.  I haven't watched many comedies of late.  I'm so curious if you guys are like Warhol colleagues or Always Sunny or any of those 
[03:09:00]  shows.  I loved Always Sunny.  So good.  I tapped out for whatever reason.  I don't know why I tapped out for no specific reason, but I loved that show.  Oh, Riley.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's gotta go.  So much fun, guys.  I love Tiny.  Absolutely.  You come back and see us.  I guess we're done.  Yeah, I guess we're done, too.  Hi, Riley.  Yeah, sure.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Bye.  After 20 years of broadcasting excellence, Opie and Anthony have created a show that doesn't  allow a moment to be missed.  So don't.  Catch what you didn't hear.  Or listen to it all over again. 
[03:09:30]  The Opie and Anthony Encore, starting at 11 a.m. Eastern time.  Eastern time.  after 20 months, I hope tonight.  Have a great day.  Thank you. </pre>
