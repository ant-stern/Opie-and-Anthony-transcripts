<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a defiant stance on provocative radio, rejecting the need for niceness.  The hosts then discussed the Celtics' 131-92 NBA championship victory over the Lakers, criticizing John Sterling's announcing style.  The conversation shifted to the unfair firing of Mets manager Willie Randolph, prompting a caller, Keith from WBCN, to mention "Whip Em Out Wednesday," leading to a lengthy, sexually suggestive discussion about breasts. Opie also vented about his delayed pool installation.  A caller, Bobby from Boston, shared a similar pool contractor experience.  The show played audio of Willie Randolph discussing his firing and then moved to a controversial ESPN article by Jameel Hill comparing Celtics fans to Hitler supporters.  Audio from Toucher and Rich of WBCN condemning Hill's statement was played, sparking a debate about media double standards.  Further listener calls and discussion of Hill's past criticisms of Don Imus followed.  Other topics included a Metallica concert, Paul McCartney's birthday, and Sam's gossip report on Opie's relationship with Jill Nicolini. Kenny's absence was explained due to the recent death of Roland. The segment concluded with a tease for "Morning Buzz with Sam" and Rage Against the Machine.

A caller corrected Opie's misidentification of a Rage Against the Machine song, leading to banter with a Long Island radio DJ.  A listener's dislike of the band prompted the display of a large wad of cash.  The main topic became a bizarre news story about Macrida Patterson suing Victoria's Secret after a thong decorative piece hit her eye.  The hosts engaged in vulgar jokes about Patterson's age and the incident.  Several callers—Dano (Kentucky), Max (Dallas), and Brian (Sayreville)—joined the conversation, leading to humorous and cynical advice for the recent high school graduate. The discussion returned to Patterson's lawsuit, with further ribald commentary, and touched on a New York sports sweep and a video clip of Joan Rivers using offensive language about Russell Crowe on British TV.  Joan Rivers' extensive plastic surgery was also discussed. George Takei's wedding and a discussion about unexpectedly gay celebrities followed, culminating in Opie finding a photo resembling him.  Big A's awkward karaoke and an in-studio appearance by comedian Mike Birbiglia concluded the segment. Birbiglia discussed his one-man show, sleepwalking anecdotes, and his divorce, sharing relatable experiences with the hosts.  A listener criticized the show's humor, transitioning to a discussion of Boston's comedy scene. A caller recalled Club Soda Kenny messing up Birbiglia's food order, resulting in a playful on-air spanking. The segment continued with discussions of Opie's unreturned lunch invitation, Birbiglia's Google alerts, name confusion, and a joke about giving athletes white babies with trophies. Kenny shared a story from his time as a police officer, involving shooting into a car during a drug bust, and a caller claimed to have bought the damaged vehicle. A brief call with UFC president Dana White discussed fighter pay disputes, the Couture-Emelianenko fight, and White's own career.  The segment ended with a censored playback of Joan Rivers' offensive remarks.

UFC President Dana White discussed fighter pay, the Couture-Emelianenko fight difficulties, his career, and his opinions on Kimbo Slice and Brock Lesnar. He predicted the UFC's future dominance over the NFL and soccer. Following White's interview, porn actress Lisa Sparks joined, discussing her career, including her gangbang record, and her relationship with her husband.  Sexually explicit conversation ensued.  A birthday celebration for Cream Pie Jones was mentioned.

The show centered on Cream Pie Jones' 21st birthday.  Sexually explicit conversation with Cream Pie, Lisa Sparks, and staff, including intern E-Rich, ensued.  Cream Pie's discomfort was apparent.  The hosts encouraged (or pressured) E-Rich into simulated sexual activity with Lisa Sparks.  Legal implications were discussed. Mike Birbiglia left during this segment.  A caller, Pat from Menaki, was connected, with plans to meet Lisa Sparks for sexual activity. The segment ended with Lisa Sparks sitting on an inflatable penis and further sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shot shots, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Alright, we get it.  Pull out the mag, and get the round out of the chamber.  Hello?  Yeah?  I'm here.  What was that?  It was one in the chamber.  Larry, I want to apologize on behalf of Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  No, I mean, he can call me  anything he wants to. 
[00:01:00]  You son of a...  That's fine.  Hillborough County officials  say a woman was hit  and killed by another vehicle.  Pierce died at the scene.  It's time for people  to understand  these are words.  If you don't like them,  turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show  on the road.  That's over. 
[00:01:30]  They're not coming back.  I have nothing else to do.  Oh, boy.  They're not coming back.  Oh, I'll be saying  they're not coming back.  They're not coming back.  Oh, it's over.  Biggest comeback  in sports history.  God, coming back.  I don't feel it.  I don't feel it.  No, you're not feeling this.  I don't think this is going to happen.  I don't think Boston is too strong  and they beat them in L.A.  It's over.  It's over.  So Celtics will win  their championship tonight.  Bank on it.  You think so?  Bank on it.  All right.  I hope he says  bank on it, people.  You know what that means. 
[00:02:00]  Go Celtics, go.  Watch it.  Woo.  Well, these shots  got left on the shot clock  as this crowd  ready to roar  with the final buzzer sound.  There's a 24-second violation.  And after a 22-year absence,  the Boston Celtics  are NBA champions once again.  Come on.  Come on.  Wow.  Way to make it exciting, boys.  Way to make it exciting 
[00:02:30]  And after 22 years  The Celtics have won their 17th championship  Any overturned cars or anything  Any fires  Any innocent girls getting their eyes shut out with beanbag guns  All's quiet in Boston  Celtics win  And that guy couldn't care less  Couldn't care  And there it is  What's the final score?  I watched some of it  And I watched it in the fourth quarter  And it was such a heartless performance by the Lakers 
[00:03:00]  It was embarrassing  It was  They won by what?  40 points or something like that?  It was a blowout  It was a blowout  Kobe Bryant  131-92  Thank you  He hasn't passed the ball ever  Wait it was 131-92?  Even I know that's a little lopsided for basketball  A little bit  And I know nothing about basketball  39-point deficit  Wow  Celtics win 
[00:03:30]  Celtics win  How about that?  I like my announcer to be somewhere in between  I don't like him to be as dull as what you just heard  And I don't like the over-the-top, make-it-about-me guy  Right  But somewhere in the middle is just right  Like a Joe Buck  You like Joe Buck's delivery?  Mr. Buck does a fine job  He doesn't like sell it too much  It's perfect  Yeah  It's perfect  Not this John Sterling who calls the dumb Yankee games here in New York 
[00:04:00]  That's for him  Awful  Is he over-the-top?  A little bit  A little bit  Just a chat  What did he say with Gian Bino there  Belting two homers last night  I'm sure he must have said something stupid  I wish it had been  Yeah I know  I'm sure there's something  Maybe we could grab that up  I'll just get the disc filled of  Filled with all his old calls  Yeah I'm sure it's the same stuff  Same exact thing  I wonder if it was a back-to-back  And a belly-to-belly  Remember yesterday 
[00:04:30]  I gotta speak for all Mets fans today  Remember yesterday  We were talking about Willie Randolph getting fired  Yep  There's more facts coming out  And the guy was fired in the middle of the night  After he was made to go on a road trip all the way to L.A.  Coast to coast  Oh does this franchise stink  And they fired him in the middle of the night  Fired him in the middle of the night  They sent out an email to like reporters at 3.30 in the morning  That would be what?  Around 12.30 New York time 
[00:05:00]  3.30  Oh no it wouldn't be  No it's the other way around  So it would be 6.30 in the morning New York time  I had it backwards  Yeah  Backwards  Can you imagine?  Getting fired  Like they should have said just stay home  Yeah  We're firing you  They made him  That long plane ride back  It made him go on the road  And then they fire him after they win  In the middle of the night  Yeah  Oh god does baseball suck  I really try to like it  I really try 
[00:05:30]  It's just awful  And just like I said yesterday jokingly  The pictures of Willie Randolph on the front page of the New York papers  Not a hint of a Mets logo  Not even like a Met color in that hat  No  He went anti-Met  Anti-Met quickly  Opposite of any Met color  Oh yeah look at this  Look at this picture  He's got a  What is that a Can-on?  I don't know that brand  Can-on hat on or something  Just a weird like baseball cap  Not a baseball cap  Well it is a baseball cap 
[00:06:00]  But it doesn't have a  A baseball logo on it  No  So  That is just unbelievable though  What are they  Needed him to manage the  The team that night?  Yeah  They drag him out there and  Fire him in the middle of the night  Unbelievable  Let's say hi to Keith  Who's calling from WBCN  Home of the world champions  Boston Celtics  Hey how you guys doing?  What's up Keith?  Hey today's my favorite day on the O.B. Anthony show 
[00:06:30]  What would that be sir?  You know I like Wednesdays  I like Wednesdays  Because I get to see  Boobies  Boobies!  Oh  He must be talking about  Whip Em Out Wednesday  Yes Whip Em Out Wednesday is here  Promotion that has swept the nation for years and years and years  And years and years and years  Right  And years and years  Get a wow on your vehicle  You drive around  And if women feel so inclined  They see the wow  They understand what it means 
[00:07:00]  They drive up next to you  And flash  Yeah this wow thing worked a lot better  When we were doing afternoon drive  But now that it's finally sunny in the morning  Which we get like  We work like we're in Alaska  Around here  Yeah  That's pretty much what it is  When you do morning radio  You get to see the sun  I don't know  Like two and a half months out of the year  And the rest of the time  It's pitch black  Extremely dark  Until almost seven  Or something ridiculous  Yeah  So right now  We're enjoying sunlight  As we do our morning show 
[00:07:30]  So maybe  Maybe the wow thing  Will work a little better  Now that we're in this  This part of the year  Sunny  Nicer weather  Get the wow stickers  The wow signs  Write it on the dirt  Anyway  Just w-o-w  Put it on your vehicle  The girls that listen to the show  They know what it means  And if you go to  O-n-a-radio.com  If you're in the New York area  You can get a wow sticker  And don't get frustrated  If it doesn't happen  The first or second day  It's like fishing  You put your hooks in the water  And you wait  And then before you know it

[00:09:00]  No  Look at that  Look at that bird segway  Huh  I  I'm in my backyard yesterday  Because I go out there  To check out on the progress  Of the pool  I don't  It's still a big pile of dirt  Yeah  I'll tell you one thing  Hello  This pool company  Is two days away  From getting the worst commercial  They've ever heard in their life  On this program  I swear to you 
[00:09:30]  If you're listening to this program  And I know  I know some of them listen  Friday's D-Day  Friday is D-Day  Nice  You will get the worst commercial  Ever  You will be inundated  With phone calls  From pests  Ordering pools  Full of AIDS  I'm sure  Because I've had it  I don't want to look at mud  In my backyard  Summer's half over  Summer's half over  Thank you Opie  No it's not  It doesn't even begin 
[00:10:00]  Until what  Saturday  I got a chick  I need a Victoria's Secret  Bikini by my pool  Are you crazy  What's the matter  Get my pool done  What's the matter  It's taking forever  They're what I call  Dilly-dallying  Jimmy  Dilly-dallying  I don't need it  Get in there  And get to work  What's the problem  I don't know  I come around the corner  To my house  On a daily basis  And I turn the corner 
[00:10:30]  And see no trucks  Nothing being done  And Keith brought up  An interesting point  He goes  I think you gave him  Too much money  Too much money up front  They ask for a certain deposit  And then there's money  You give him  And then when the job's done  You give him a little more money  Well I gave him  A pretty big chunk  Which more than paid  For the materials  That they had already laid out  So I don't know  What the hell's going on  But I'll tell you  Two days away  My friends  Two days  From the worst 
[00:11:00]  Possible commercial  You're going to get  For your pool company  So get to it  Snap to it  Tired of it  Friday's D-Day  D-Day  They're not there  Every day working  Why would they be  I thought they were  Diligently putting that pool in  That's what I thought  I thought like  You were probably  A diving board thing  They probably had the water in  And they were just  Dusting off the outside  Oh yeah  I wish  The only water in there  Is brown rain water  At the bottom of the gunite  They haven't even sprayed 
[00:11:30]  The nice marble coating  Or anything yet  When is this supposed to be done?  They said two weeks  Six months ago  Oh boy  I am  Livid  Oh boy  Livid  Are they behind schedule Anthony?  Are they behind schedule?  Behind schedule  Don't even joke  Yes they're very behind schedule  What do they say when you call?  They don't  Keith calls  And he gives them  What I call hell  And then they come up  With excuses 
[00:12:00]  Or they say they're going to be there  And then they're not there  I want them there today  Today  Today  Today  That's right  It just  This whole thing led into  I'm in my back  Oh okay  And so I'm standing out there  And I'm  Overlooking my empire  Of dirt  And  Two birds  These swallow-tailed  Kind of birds  I notice 
[00:12:30]  Flying a little close to me  Like wow that's weird  They're protecting their babies  And then I'm looking around  And then I notice  One coming directly  Toward my eyeballs  Dude  Straight toward my face  A dive bomber  So I duck  And it makes this  Quick turn away from me  And the other one  Comes diving down on my head  I'm in my yard now  Covering my head  Running  Like a scene from the birds  I'm running from my house  I get in and I'm like  Son of a bitch 
[00:13:00]  What are they doing?  And I notice up on a column  That holds up  You know part of the  Overhang over my patio  That there's some mud  And leaves and stuff  That they're just  They've been packing up there  To make a nest  And they're protecting  Their nest  So I walk out there  Again  The same thing  So I start heaving  Rocks at them  You know  And you can't hit  These things  They're birds  What am I  An Indian?  I can't do  I can't do this  You can't aim  For the actual bird  You can't  You really gotta lead them 
[00:13:30]  And then they turn  On a dime  Those things  It's amazing  Yeah you just gotta pick  A spot in the air  And hope  And hope you hit something  And hope that the rock  And the bird  Hit that spot at the same time  And believe me  Yes people  I did contemplate  Breaking out one of the guns  And just start  Rattling some shots  Off into the air  But I thought better of it  These birds were so scary  They're coming at me  With sharp beaks  How big are they?  They're probably  I don't know  Maybe eight inches long 
[00:14:00]  No  Yeah  A swallow?  From beak to tail  Okay  I'd say  And they dive bomb you  If you get close to that nest  So I just went inside  And I left it there  Because I want the pool guys  To get attacked by the birds  I was gonna knock the nest down  You know  I was gonna spray it with a hose  And I said no  You know something  Because tomorrow  They're all gonna be out here  And they're gonna get  Dive bombed by these birds  And let them deal 
[00:14:30]  With it  Don't spray the nest down  Why?  You're gonna be sad  When you see like  A little baby bird  No no  They haven't laid any eggs in it  They're just building it  Featherless  Just in a puddle of water  On your patio  I could care less  I don't know  The new Anthony  Caring about things  This might hurt them  Not when they're dive bombing me  This might hurt you a little bit  That's what it looked like  It looked like  The one all the way  To the right  E-Rock  Frightening birds  Hey I got good news  Monsters  Good news on your pool  Bobby in Boston  What's up Bobby?  Hey how's it going guys? 
[00:15:00]  Hey Bobby  Congratulations on the Celtics  My friend  Thank you very much  By the way  I'm from New York  Oh really?  So you don't even give a crap  Alright  What do you got Bobby?

[00:16:00]  Do you hear that pool company  Anthony's actually going to do show prep  Get a move on  And no Sergio from Jersey  They're not Blue Jays  For the love of God  I know what a Blue Jay looks like  They're blue  They're blue  This wasn't blue  It was a brown bird  With a whitish tail  A swallow tail on it  And you know what  The nest is done by the way  You think it's already done?  These effers  They don't have to go to work or nothing  Their whole life is  Their whole life is to build a nest 
[00:16:30]  The nest is done  Yeah but they got little beaks  You know how much they could carry with that?  They're not like  It's like building a house made of bricks  And you gotta carry every brick with your mouth  But they're not like you and I  And when I mean you and I  The people out there  Because we're lucky to live a little differently  Than the average Joe  Certainly are  But you know  They're not like you and I  Where you have a full time job  And then you try to get a deck done on the side  On the side on the weekend  With some of your buds  They have nothing else to do  But build that  Build that nest  Yes  It's done already 
[00:17:00]  I can only hope they attack the pool guys  It's done  And there's a family of three in there  There best not be  There's at least three kids in there already  Because I'm going to put the nozzle on  Remove flesh  Velocity  And just spray that thing  I want to see baby birds flying on a geyser  Hey can we go backwards for a second?  Backwards!  This is a little audio on the Willie Randolph thing  Willie speaks  Ex-manager of the New York Mets  Just real quick guys 
[00:17:30]  I don't really have much to say really  You know  What are your initial feelings  About how it went down?  Well  I'm just  You know  Very disappointed  That  I'm going to be able to  Fulfill what my dream is  To come here  And help this team win a world championship  You know  I just  I miss my players  The fans  I'm really sorry  That we're able to  Fulfill  What I really said  I want to do  And get this team to world championship  That's what I've all been about  And it's very difficult right now 
[00:18:00]  But  You know  I'm going to move on  What about the next time right now?  You know  Go home and join my family  Did you know this was coming  When you left the stadium?  Firing the guy  In the middle of the night  As he's in LA  Oh my god  Does my team suck  Now fly home  And get your shine box  Does my team suck  You couldn't get this figured out? 
[00:18:30]  Two days  After Father's Day  He gets on a plane  I think probably Father's Day  To fly out to LA  Just so he can get fired  In the middle of the night  Thanks  They're calling it here in New York  The worst firing  In baseball history  The worst firing  In baseball history  Wow really?  Yeah they're up there  Think about that  Although they  Billy Martin's had a couple  They did mention  A couple of good firings right?  They did mention how they fired  Oh here it is  About the only one that comes close  Was George Steinbrenner's  Firing of Yogi Berra 
[00:19:00]  Oh yeah  That was a good one  After just 16 games  Remember Jimmy  You were joking about  Get a manager  And then fire him  After the first game  I thought of that  All day yesterday  And every time  I thought about it  I laughed my ass off  It was just one of the funniest things  Jimmy suggested  That a team hire  A coach  A manager  And then  The second he loses  One game  They fire him  And bring a new guy in  And repeat  But you have a big press conference  About how we believed him 
[00:19:30]  To be the future  And we realized  He's been a grave disappointment  We apologize to our fans  And then you talk up  The next guy  He's coming in  This guy we know  Is going to rally the team  And then when he loses  One game  Again we are gravely disappointed  And angry  And angry  Really just a humiliating  Fire  But then the next day  You have like the future  And the hope  The same speech  For the brand new guy  Yeah  Hopefully  Hopefully after a 3-2 loss  By the way  Oh yeah  A 3-2 loss  Or a big lead  That's thrown by a guy 
[00:20:00]  Dropping a ball  Yeah  It's not even the manager's fault  Right  Couldn't have been prevented  Like the home run ball  Bounces off the guy's head  Just some dumb thing  I like it  But back in 85  They fired Yogi Berra  After just 16 games  16 lousy games  How long was Willie there for?  Uh  2004  Alright yeah  I was going to say  Alright very good  Uh  And then  Mike  Uh  Mike?  No  Mike  Mad Dog  From Mike and the Mad Dog  Mike and the Mad Dog 
[00:20:30]  What a bad judgment call  To let this go through  Meantime  Sports Radio  WFAN  A blaze with criticism  Over how Randolph  Was let go  If you're a Met person  Right now  You're embarrassed  For your ball club  You did a terrible job  You look like  A Mickey Mouse organization  Terrible  You got fired  A Mickey Mouse area  And you look like  A Mickey Mouse organization  There's nothing else to say  Mickey Mouse area  What?

[00:22:30]  Metallica rocked Bonnaroo, huh Jimmy?  Yeah, great, Opie  Right on, Jimmy, way over there  It's the Opie and Anthony show  877-212-ON-A  I hear there's a huge fan on the Metallica crew  On his fine radio show  So whoever that guy is  I want to say hi  What's his name, Jimmy?  And what does he do for Metallica?  I don't know  Steve Wiggs  A buddy of mine  He's Lars' assistant  He introduced me  I want to say his name is Joey Ortega  I'm going completely from memory 
[00:23:00]  If I'm wrong, Rob  Sorry  I don't know exactly what he did  But I know that when security tried to stop us  From going up to the side of the stage  Whenever he walked over  And went, no, no, no  And waved security off  Nice  Oh, how sweet is that?  That was wonderful  Because once again  I was a boy without the right badge  I'll tell you  Concerts  Probably have some of the best  Slash worst  Security  Anywhere in the world  I'm talking airports  The United Nations 
[00:23:30]  Like when you go to a concert  And there's a place  You're not supposed to be  You will not get there  That's just the way it is  Sometimes when you're supposed to be there  You can't get there  Get Metallica security  To work the airport  Yeah  And we'll all be a lot safer  Just get  Like any band  Any band's security  Like the  Or arena's security  To work the airports  And  Well, everyone will be late  For their flights  Planes will be empty  You're not supposed to be here  No, I got my ticket  Come on, move  Move

[00:24:30]  Stone Temple Pilots  Not for their  Being bums  And yelling at each other  But for everybody  Getting tossed at BCN  Because  I don't think  What happened was  That day  I don't think the band  Went  Get everybody out of here  The band owns the stage  So it's a practice  That when they get there  Like after X o'clock  Everyone's out  Doesn't matter who you are  X o'clock  The band has  I miss that  It's the Roman  Oh, okay  10 o'clock  Yeah  Or if it's  You're not your  Present girlfriend o'clock  Or if it's 
[00:25:00]  Ray o'clock  Keep improv-ing, Jimbo  Lots of X jokes  Are coming  Yuck  I think it's  So basically  They'll just clear everybody out  Because Metallica  Those are these  Great risers  Where you could watch  The show from  And so I actually  Saw the show above  I was like looking down  At James  And all those  Oh, nice  It was fantastic  I love that view  It was great, right?  Yeah, yeah  But right before the show  They came up  And they cleared that off  And I'm like  Well, I'm performing  At Bonnaroo  I'm like  Why are you guys  Asking me to leave

[00:26:00]  It really is an  All or nothing thing  With them  It's like, okay  Everybody gets the hell off  Or everybody's got to  Be able to come on  To the stage  You bring this one's  Friend, this one  Yeah, before you know it  There's 50 people up there  Yeah, and they can't  Get their girlfriends  Or their friends  Up there to watch  I kind of understand that  I don't  I hate them  Oh boy  I want to be treated special  So do I  I wanted the band  To come out  And go, hey  We'd love this special  I go, really?

[00:32:00]  Yeah  I guess he's lonely  Yeah  You see a Goodwill bag  And it pans in  And it's all left shoes  That still have the clean rubber underneath  Still has the paper  Tucked into the toe  Where they're all over the house  Being used as different things  Like planters  Door stops  Candy dishes  Door stops  Clunk and clunky earmuffs  What does this video mean?

[00:33:00]  Me  We got Robin.  She's a regular to the Opie and Anthony show.  She's calling from Detroit.  Hi, Robin.  You might be seeing Heather around there because she bought a $5 million apartment in Manhattan  and she liked the location because it was a hop, hop, and a hop from Central Park.  Very nice.  That's what she's doing with Paul's money, huh?  All right.  Love you.  Love you.  I want to share a hop by Strawberry Fields and says, 
[00:33:30]  I've done more damage to this man than Chapman did.  Hey, the big news today, Celtics win their, what, 17th championship?  And there's a little controversy up there in Boston today.  You got a guy, Jameel, I believe, Hill of ESPN.com,  comparing rooting for the Celtics to Hitler.  I was going to say Hitler as a joke.  To Hitler.  Why?  I don't know.  And I think this guy was very vocal when Imus got fired, which makes it quite interesting today, yes. 
[00:34:00]  To Hitler.  A girl, they're saying.  A girl?  What's her name?  Jameel?  All right, let's go with this.  Was she vocal when Imus got fired?  Yeah.  Very vocal, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Here we go.  Here's the story.  Fans are certainly psyched for a Celtics win,  but a recent article about the series on ESPN.com,  it's not sitting too well with them.  Kim, when I read the article from the ESPN article to Celtics fans,  that statement, they were so upset and shocked, 
[00:34:30]  they said it's one of the most insensitive comparisons they've ever heard.  We're not talking about war.  We're talking about basketball.  But it's a statement that has Celtics fans up in arms.  I don't think you can say Hitler's a victim no matter what the circumstance is to begin with,  but, uh, yeah, that's over the top.  And here's the statement that was on the ESPN website.  Writer Jameel Hill writes,  You know what? 
[00:35:00]  Uh, what'd she say about Imus?  Do we have, like, oh, you got it?  Wow.  Sam is good.  Well, we, well, Toucher and Rich, right?  Yeah, Toucher and Rich.  Yeah, Toucher and Rich, who do afternoons on WBCN,  they're taking up this cause big time.  Oh, good.  Good for them.  And, uh, we got some audio of them just going off yesterday on their radio show.  It's amazing that they have to take it up, though.  Like, it's amazing that, uh, where are the guys in Media Matters  or the Black Journalists Association?  Where are all those bums, those creeps in Media Matters? 
[00:35:30]  Where are they?  Look, you should be able to say what she said.  Of course.  But, if you're also the one being very vocal about Imus' firing,  that's where we certainly have a major problem.  A major problem.  Wow.  This is Toucher and Rich from yesterday on WBCN up there in Boston.  All right, I love this, and I want to talk about it as much as possible today.  In page two of the Herald, they have, uh, I don't know how you pronounce her name,  Jamela Hill from ESPN's page two column wrote, uh, about the Celtics  and about how she still hates them, and she compares liking the Celtics 
[00:36:00]  to supporting Hitler and wanting, uh, Gorbachev to press the button before Reagan,  uh, for nuclear weapons.  And, uh, and there was a bunch of controversy, apparently,  and ESPN.com had to, uh, edit the article.  Yeah, they yanked it after a couple hours.  Hmm.  So that's all the punishment she gets, huh?  That's it.  Just yank the article.  What is this from?  Yesterday?  No, this is from...  Oh, okay.  This is from, uh, when Imus was, uh, getting fired.  This is the same, uh, lady. 
[00:36:30]  The oversexed...  Uh, this is by Jamel, uh, Hill.  The oversexed Jezebel, the welfare mother, the mammy,  and now the latest catchphrase to be added to the lexicon of stereotypes  about black women, the nappy-headed blank.  Are we allowed to say that anymore?  No.  Even in a news story?  Of course not.  Of course not.  Why?  Uh, thank you, Don Imus, for your valuable contribution.  If it were up to me, security would have escorted the longtime radio jock  out of his CBS radio cocoon, uh, with belongings in tow days ago. 
[00:37:00]  But for now, I'll have to settle for a two-week suspension  that doesn't begin until next week.  That'll show him.  That's what she had to say about Imus,  as she's doing pretty much the exact same thing a little over a year later.  It continues with Toucher & Rich from yesterday.  Now, do you recall this woman?  Do you recall her big cause day celeb, uh, about a year ago?  No, I don't remember her.  It's time we take a stand together against indecency and cruelty  and call for Don Imus to be fired.  You hypocritical bitch! 
[00:37:30]  All you people in the media who, uh, who come out against someone  when they make an honest mistake  and there's a firestorm of controversy,  you should be fired.  Your columns should be all taken, uh, as lies and phoniness.  How's it feel?  How's it feel?  How's it feel to get knocked off your, uh, soapbox?  How's it feel not to be the righteous one any longer?  He's right.  And I would love to know, again,  why the scum in media matters are not going after her 
[00:38:00]  the way they went after him.  I'll tell you why.  It's a black woman attacking Jews.  Exactly.  Making fun of Jews, who cares?  Yeah, white guy, not even attacking blacks.  Just trying to make a, uh, a joke.  And in fairness, she wasn't attacking Jews,  but I mean, it's, it's, it's black on Jew, who cares?  Right, right.  That's the bottom line.  They're not going to go after that.  It's time we take a stand against Jamila Hill.  I suggest everyone contact ESPN Magazine  in a demand for her to be fired.  Sure, I would say taking light of a, uh, situation  in which millions of people were killed.  It's a lot worse than being racist. 
[00:38:30]  My son is Jewish, and I, for one,  do not take this lightly at all.  I demand that Jamila Hill be fired.  Her cruel, insensitive comments,  Don Imus' thing was just off the top of his head.  Jamila Hill, or however the hell you pronounce her name.  She wrote it out.  She, uh, proofread it.  Mm-hmm.  Why was she saying rooting for the Celtics  is like, uh, saying Hitler was a victim?  Like, I, what, what was her point?  What was her point on this? 
[00:39:00]  Uh.  I'm not, I'm not savvy.  Because, uh, she's from Detroit.  Okay.  So, there used to be, like, a big Pistons-Celtics rivalry.  Right.  So, for her to root for the Celtics  would be like her rooting for Hitler.  Yeah, it's like, you know,  Red Sox fans don't root for the Yankees.  You know, it's like that he did of a rivalry back then.  Right.  So, it was just, you know, it was a stupid one-off moment.  What she said is not even that bad.  No.  But it's so great.  And they suspended her, by the way. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Look at her dumb face.  Good.  But, uh, she was suspended yesterday  after sparking outrage  by comparing and rooting for the Celtics  to Adolf Hitler in a nuclear war.  Good for, uh, Toucher and Rich  for blasting this bitch.  Absolutely.  Good for you guys.  Uh, she also said,  rooting for the Celtics  is like supporting inflation,  unemployment, and locusts.  It's like praying for Eva Mendes  to get married  and for Brad Pitt to be disfigured.  It's like wishing dollars-  Wait, a disfiguring joke?  Wow.  That's kind of insensitive.  Yeah, it certainly is.  All the people have been disfigured. 
[00:40:00]  Gee.  It's like wishing dollar bills  and free time for Pac-Man Jones.  It's like hopping the pit bull,  hoping the pit bull  doesn't take Michael Vick's pinky  as a memento.  It's like wanting Ron Arrest raps  on repeat.  It's like coveting fungus.  Wow.  How about a slave trade joke?  How about that?  How about it's like-  Whoa, now you're going too far, Jimmy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Be careful there, Jimmy.  It's like wishing, uh, yeah,  John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln  before he signed  the Emancipation Proclamation. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  Why don't you say that?  It's like, I'm going to do Diallo,  opening a plunger store.  Right.  Oh, would that get you fired  if you wrote that show?  Oops.  And then, uh, I'm glad  that he's got a big dumper.  Touch on Rich from BCN.  They continued from yesterday's show.  Listen to the very end  of her article.  He is routinely offensive  to people, speaking of  imies, of color and women.  If he needs to lose his job  to understand that there's  no place for this,  so be it.  As a society,  there are times when we need  to take a stand together  against indecency and cruelty.  Well, guess what?  Woman, we are taking a stand 
[00:41:00]  right now.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  She did the exact same thing  that she accused Imus of doing.  The exact same thing.  So did Al Roker.  And, uh, again, once again,  uh, uh, you know,  let's see what happens to her,  but of course,  the black personality  says something  and they get away  with an apology,  um, because Media Matters  is not going to go after them  and black journalists  are not going to go after them.  And that's the big problem.  See how easy it is  to make a mistake?  Yeah.  When you're trying  to, like, uh,  write a column  or do a radio show  or do a live TV show? 
[00:41:30]  When, uh,  when Whitey is being racist,  it's very obvious.  It's very, um, overt.  It's brought out  into the open  and, and they're compared  to, uh, Klan members,  Nazis, whatever.  When a black person's  being racist,  it's just, uh,  you know,  it's just whatever.  It's black pride.  It's, um,  it's just voicing  an opinion,  uh, but it's,  it's equally as,  to, to the people  that, that find it offensive,  it's equally as damaging. 
[00:42:00]  Like Ope says,  I don't care.  I think people should be able  to say whatever the hell  they want.  Of course.  But, uh,  there's too much  of a double standard.  Yeah, the point we're making,  though,  if you're going to go  after Imus,  you certainly shouldn't  be doing what Imus did.  Yeah, exactly.  I think Imus should say  whatever the hell he wants  and, and as much as I,  I hate this broad,  uh, she should be able  to say whatever the hell  she wants.  But it doesn't work that way.  If you're going to attack  Imus, then you better,  you better keep, uh,  your columns pretty safe.  Pretty safe, my friend.  Is she fat?  Uh, she looks like a fat face.  She looks, her face 
[00:42:30]  looks like she's probably fat.  Yes, not Brent.  But I can't tell.  Where's the editor's  situation on this?  This was a posted article.  She had to write it  and put it up on a website  that generates millions  of dollars.  Where is ESPN's  responsibility in this?  Where's the boycott?  Where's the advertisers  saying we're going to boycott  until she's fired?  Yeah, right.  Where is that?  Yeah, someone's got  to get that rolling.  Yeah.  Uh, jameelespn  at gmail.com.  Oh boy.  Uh, I see the end keys  on a lot of computers  getting, uh,  the letter rubbed off of it. 
[00:43:00]  No, no, I'm sure  that in Detroit  they'll stick up  for the NAACP.  Yeah, of course.  Let the system be fire.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Michael Vick,  they'll come up with  some excuse  why it's okay for her  to do this  and it's not okay  for anybody else.  That's right.  Jameel is spelled  J-E-M-E-L-E  E-S-P-N  at gmail.com.  One more clip  from Toucher and Rich  from their program  yesterday.  As the parent  of a Jewish son,  my own flesh and blood  who has been brisked  only two weeks ago, 
[00:43:30]  I call for the firing  of Jameela Hill.  I want this  on the website.  I want to campaign  out against this woman  because it just shows you  the hypocritical nature  of people.  Anyone can say  something stupid.  Yes.  And we all do.  We all say something  stupid all the time.  But the minute you  step up on your soapbox  and you show the world  how righteous you are  and you cast a stone,  oh, you better watch out.  That is the God's 
[00:44:00]  honest truth right there.  Yep.  Beat it.  Al Roker did the exact  same thing.  Attacked, went after  Imus, and then he put  his big, fat, stupid  foot in his mouth.  Right in his stomach  stapling, didn't work  mouth.  Right.  It's so great to see.  Boy, was he nervous.  And then he had to  grovel and apologize  and, you know.  Yeah.  Yep.  He was lucky enough  to keep his job.  Well, yeah.  I mean, he's just  a fat, worthless weatherman.  A guy whose job it is  is to tell you if it's sunny.  Just smile for the camera,  stupid.  That's what you do.  Because epilepsy  isn't as important 
[00:44:30]  as black women  playing the college basketball.  Right.  That's what I learned  from that whole thing.  Problem is epileptics.  Al Roker said something  that was way worse  than Imus.  Way worse.  Oh, hell yeah.  Making fun of, you know,  kids with epilepsy.  Way worse.  They don't have a...  And you know what?  Once again, I don't care.  Al Roker should be able  to say that.  But if you're going to go  after Imus for saying  what he did,  then you should shut  your big, fat,  I-can't-help-eating mouth.  Right?  They don't have a special  interest group  organized 
[00:45:00]  like these other groups.  You know why?  Because they can't get  past the logo.  The logo keeps  freaking them out.  Every time they write,  they scribble all over  the place.  And yes, that was  making fun of epileptics.  Yes, they did.  They just can't use  colors in their logo.  Yeah.  It's all cut out  of the newspaper  and painted gingerly.  Gingerly.  It's a life of black and white.  Yeah.  There's many flashing colors.  This dumb broad,  Jamil or Jamela,  whatever the hell.  What's wrong with Jean? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, look at her.  She looks like  she has a big, fat face.  I'm just...  I hope she's a big fatso  and she's got a boot.  Go write for someone else.  Well, that's lovely.  There you go.  Another double standard.  Well, let's see.  It just happened.  They did suspend her.  We'll see.  I don't want to see her fired.  I'm sure there'll be  outrage that she suspend it.  I think she gets fired.  You think?  Let's hope so.  I think she gets fired.  That would be nice.  It serves her...  Start a nice little trend.  Dummy. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, look.  The bottom line is this.  We've never,  no matter how much  we dislike someone,  pushed for someone  to be fired for something like that.  We've defended people  we didn't like.  Absolutely.  Who screwed up.  Mm-hmm.  Absolutely.  We've never,  ever wanted people  to be fired for screw-ups.  Yeah.  But once you start  begging for other people  to be fired,  you go too.  Yeah, wanting other people  to get fired  and then you turn around  and do the same thing.  Yeah.  The same thing.  Just trying to entertain  your readers  and you put your foot  in your mouth.  Go F yourself.  That's right.  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:46:30]  Quick break.  We'll continue  with something.  Opie and Anthony.  Intimous DJs.  Opie and Anthony.  Killing in the name of...  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka,  wow, wow, wow.  Chicka, wow, wow.  Talka, wow.  Go with it now.  Come on. 
[00:47:00]  That never kicks in.  Oh.  Oh, well, that's a little bit.  There you go.  Quit it now.  Go.  Right here.  Here it comes.  Right here.  Quit it now.  Chugga, chugga, chugga,  chugga, chugga, chugga,  chugga.  He's angry.  I think we're scaring  our upper demos today.  I'll tell you one thing.  This is one for the kids.  Even though this song's  pretty old at this point.  I know this song's old.  These guys don't like  the machine.  Dude.  Boy.  Out of the way, government. 
[00:47:30]  They rage against the machine.  They sure do.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show,  877-212-0&A.  Hey, Opie,  if you don't like the  Jamela,  whatever his dummy's name is,  you can write to  ESPN's PR office.  E-S-P-N-P-R.  E-S-P-N-P-R  at ESPN.com.  Why wouldn't you write?  Why not?  I agree with you, Jimmy.  We got Joan Rivers  cursing on live TV.  She's just terrific.  We got people online  at Ikea 
[00:48:00]  getting furniture,  if you could call it that.  It's so ridiculous.  They're waiting online  for the chance  to maybe get a couch  or something.  What's the deal?  An Ikea couch.  What's the deal?  What's the deal  with this couch?  Is it some kind of promotion?  Yeah.  They're,  what is it,  opening a new store?  So people have been  camped out  because they're giving away  a free couch,  an Ikea couch.  So you get the big box,  you throw it in the truck 
[00:48:30]  and they put it together.  The Ikea couch  was also known  as the Homo Starter Kit.  They love gay couples there.  Oh, they certainly do.  I don't like Ikea furniture.  I went there  to look for stuff.  I just didn't like it.  No, it's not big,  puffy, and comfy.  It's good if you're just  fresh out of college.  If you're a college,  right,  you're a college student.  It's just too big.  You just keep walking  and walking  and walking  from room to room.  You've got to follow a path.  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:00]  Nothing more boring.  Here's the summer room  and here's the entertainment room  and now here's the kids' room  and the kitchen.  So boring.  I just want a couch.  Just give me a wall of couches  and let me pick one.  I don't want to walk  through the maze  of rooms they set up.  I know we've gotten  in trouble in the past.  Slight trouble  for people having  certain sex ploits  out in public.  But how great would it be  to just have a couple  go into a furniture store  like that?  Just get under the sheets 
[00:49:30]  because they're all made.  You know,  not expose themselves  but just get under the sheets  and just start banging.  It would be fantastic.  What the hell  do you think you're doing?  I'm taking it  for a test drive.  Yeah, what's your problem?  Yeah.  You could take a car  for a test drive.  Why not a bed?  That's what I say.  What happened?  I don't know.  Jill just looks  very good today.  He certainly does.  I like that top.  Yes.  Did you pick that out  for her today?  No.  She's giving you  secret messages today  by the way.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  I see two of them.  The messages  scare at me.  You betcha.  That's a sexy top.  Anthony's lover  had a secret message  for Anthony today  as she was doing  her traffic report  here in New York City.  This is how it went down  about an hour ago.  This fiberglass prototype  runs on battery  instead of fossil fuel  and it's expected  to cost about $30,000  but will be extremely  inexpensive to drive.  Very futuristic this car.  Yeah, very cool. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Well, let's check  on our own roads.  Yeah, Jill Nicolini.  Nothing that cool  out on the roads  this morning.  No, there is.  You know what I love?  My new favorite car  is the Mustang Shelby.  It is the hottest thing.  I love it.  Good morning, guys.  Checking out  the Springbrook Parkway.  That would be  Anthony's car  for the people  that don't know.  Jeepers creepers.  She loves when you  drive around  in the Shelby, huh?  Well.  As you get tickets  all over  the Long Island Expressway.  Yeah.  Yeah, we do get  pulled over in that a lot.  Why don't you guys 
[00:51:00]  get married  so she can eventually  own the Shelby?  Ah, what the hell.  We'll give some more.  The people are begging for it  so why don't we give them  an Anthony update?  Oh, there's a new one?  With young Sam.  Another day,  another update  as the news on  Anthony keeps coming in.  When we last left  the king and queen  of Long Island rubbish,  Jill wouldn't even  acknowledge Anthony  on television.  After hearing our report,  Jill went on the air  and said this.  Is that your new boyfriend? 
[00:51:30]  I see.  I don't mean to call you  out on that,  but that is him, right?  Anthony?  I think everyone knows.  That's Anthony Cumia, yeah.  Yes.  From Opie and Anthony.  Thank you so much  for coming down, darling.  Sound forced much?  Sources are telling us  that Jill was none too happy  with her co-workers  for, quote,  throwing her under the bus.  And was so embarrassed  she burst into tears  after the segment aired.  At this rate,  Anthelini could go back  to being two separate names  before the week's end.  Speaking of moving on,  sources are saying  that E-Rock,  the sex bagel nagel, 
[00:52:00]  may be looking  for new employment soon.  He was once again  berated by Opie  for a lackluster performance  on the job recently,  and this one may have  finally pushed the boss  too far.  Well, E-Rock,  will you get back  to your post?  E-Rock abandons  his post a lot.  All the time.  Stop socializing.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Our reporters are telling us  that E-Rock drowned  his sorrows in ham sandwiches  and glasses of mayonnaise  as he attempted  to forget the way  his hero slash father figure  scolded him. 
[00:52:30]  We hope for his sake  those sandwiches  will be covered  by unemployment.  Stay tuned  as we bring you  all of the  Opie and Anthony show  gossip that has  North America  glued to their radio.  Great.  Sam's doing a great job  with those.  Oh, man.  We've been discussing  behind the scenes  what to call his reports.  Some hacky,  awful,  over-the-top thing  like Morning Buzz  with Sam  or something.  It's so dead on  with those dopey  entertainment shows  on TV.  It's a perfect 
[00:53:00]  parody of those.  Absolutely.  You know what it is?  It embraces Sam's  inner douche.  Yes.  Yeah,  because he loves  being an ass  and it really is  the perfect vehicle  for him.  People are asking  what happened  to Kenny's traffic.  We could do a little  traffic and weather  together on the eights.  Rick,  you're on the  Opie and Anthony show.  Hey,  what's up, guys?  What's up, Rick?  Where's Kenny been?  I haven't heard any songs  or anything in a couple weeks.  Is he slacking or what?  Well,  the whole tragic news 
[00:53:30]  with Roland  kind of took the spotlight  for a little bit.  But we'll bring back  traffic and weather  together on the eights  with Club Soda Kenny.  Okay,  maybe today  or is it two?  That might be tough.  Looking for Kenny.  Oh,  we're looking for Kenny.  We'll try to do it  either today or tomorrow  there, Rick.  We'll bring it back for you.  Thank you.  Let's go to John  on Long Island.  I know where Kenny is.  Just follow the black cloud.  If down the hallway  you see there's been rainwater,  you know he was there  momentarily.  Little lightning bolts.  Yeah.  A little storm over his head. 
[00:54:00]  His hair's the only thing  not getting wet.  John,  Long Island.  Hey,  Opie,  I gotta call you out on something.  You're giving the kids  the bad information there.  You sing it,  Kill Him Again,  in the name of,  but that's Bulls on Parade  by Rage Against the Machine.  Yeah,  I realized after,  after we moved on.  You're absolutely right.  It's Bulls on Parade,  which is an amazing  Rage Against the Machine song.  But the beginning  of any rage song  can be any rage song.  Thank you,  Anthony.  It's just the way it is.  It's a good thing  you don't play music anymore  because you don't know  what you're talking about.  Oh, 
[00:54:30]  come on.  Well,  Mr.  DJ John,  where do you work?  I work on Long Island.  I can't really tell you that.  Well,  what radio station?  Exactly!  You're really obnoxious today.  Oh,  I know.  I love it.  I absolutely love it.  Had it.  You're right,  though.  Every Rage Against the Machine  song starts pretty close. 
[00:55:00]  That Rodeo song  is the same thing.  All right.  Sam,  what?  I said,  I never liked them.  You don't?  Oh,  my God.  I never liked  Rage Against the Machine.  Shoe songs?  I never liked them.  Big wad of cash you got.  What is that?  Not that I got things to pay for.  What are you doing?  You're like some kind of a  drug dealer.  Let me show you something.  Wow,  look at that.  Is that all stripper money?  Is that just dollars?  They're all ones.  Are they all ones?  Well,  I thought it was impressive, 
[00:55:30]  but they're all ones.  I thought there was a...  There's got to be 27 ones there.  Look at that.  They're all ones.  A wad choke enough to...  A choke enough to...  Please hold.  That's what you get.  Looks like somebody wanted to blow out my candle  to make his own candle shine a little brighter.  Well...  Sorry, Jimmy.  You're right.  What's wrong, Kenny?  Nothing.  You came in like exasperated. 
[00:56:00]  You all right?  No, I'm the happiest when I'm fetching you guys food.  Fetching?  I don't know how he says that.  Kenny's precious cargo line is one of my favorites ever.  Yeah.  Such precious cargo.  Oh, is he an ass?  Just boob.  A boob.  All right, if you ate breakfast, I apologize in advance  because this story just made us throw up in our mouths a little bit this morning. 
[00:56:30]  A little disgusting?  Yeah, really.  Dinged by a G-string.  Oh, yeah, I read this one.  They insisted on putting this on page two of the New York paper today.  This almost made the cover.  If Willie Randolph didn't get fired,  this might have been on the cover of the paper this morning.  I saw it on FARC, and I click on the link,  and I thought it was going to be maybe a sexy story. 
[00:57:00]  No.  No.  Anti-sexy.  Woman, 52, which is key to the story,  sues Victoria's Secret.  Claims injury from defective thong.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Yeah.  As she was attempting to put on a Victoria's Secret thong,  a Los Angeles woman claims that a decorative metallic piece  flew off the garment and struck her in the eye. 
[00:57:30]  Good.  In the brown eye?  Whoa.  Causing injuries and a new product liability lawsuit  against the underwear giant.  Macrida?  What?  How do you say M-A-C-R-I-D-A?  Macrida?  Macrida Patterson, 52.  At least she has a sexy name.  Hey, Macrida.  No, no, no, no.  She said the metal thing bounced off and hit Macrida.  Hit Macrida. 
[00:58:00]  Get it?  Of course.  Macrida, 52, alleges that she was hurt.  Boo.  She was hurt last May.  I'm very hurt.  I was injured.  I was injured.  My thong snapped and I was blinded.  It hurt me.  My critter was bashed apart.  Macrida.  Oh.  Oh, Macrida.  Could you imagine?  There are just some names you can't just kind of talk sexy to 
[00:58:30]  or yell out in bed during that moment of passion.  Oh, Macrida.  Boo.  There it is.  Mmm.  Oh.  Oh, Macrida.  Yeah.  Just call her Shirley.  Oh, we were in the, we ate in the Waffle House.  We had to eat in the, it was the worst, but it was the worst food  situation when I was in Bonnaroo because we were about a half hour 
[00:59:00]  out and the woman, we had to eat at the Waffle House late one  night and her name was Beula.  Beula.  She was so awful.  It was B-U-E-L-A.  She probably weighed about 250.  Of course.  She was mean looking.  She kind of looked like Burt Lahr.  Oh, she had really awful long hair and she had a very thin but  very full mustache.  Wow, really?  Long stache.  Just typical for the name Beula. 
[00:59:30]  She was horrendous.  You don't see strippers named Beula.  No.  And I know they changed their names, but they never even start  out as Beula.  There's not a Jasmine Alive that has a mustache.  No.  No.  Not a one.  Not one Porsche.  Not one Porsche, right?  There's not a Ted Alive that has one like Beula did.  It was like, it was a Wilford Brimley.  It almost hit the lower lip.  Oh, my God.  A walrus mustache.  She dyed it blonde so no one would notice.  Oh, sure.  Oof.  Eee.  Black tape over it would be less conspicuous. 
[01:00:00]  Beula.  Well, let's get back to Macrida Patterson.  Macrida.  Macrida 52 alleges that she was hurt last May by a defective low-rise V-string from the  Victoria's Secret sexy little thing line.  Sexy little thing line.  You know something?  Leave the sexy little thing line for the sexy little things.  Not the 57-year-old Macrida.  Macrida.  Yeah.  You should have to, like, give your name.  And if you say, well, my name is Macrida. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, you can't.  Then they send you to the granny section.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The bloomers are over there.  Yeah, exactly.  Go to Macy's and pick up some of those big-ass underwear.  My name's Heather.  All right, Heather.  Come on in.  Thank you.  Here you go.  Here's our pretty young thing line.  My name's Gertrude.  Gertie, you might want to go to JCPenney.  Oh.  It's right down the mall.  My name's Portia.  Look for, oh, yes, Portia.  Come on in.  Pretty little thing line is right there. 
[01:01:00]  Thank you.  And you, what's it, Mildred?  Okay, Mildred, you might want to go over there where they're selling the panties where you can show home movies on the back.  They ought to send Macrida to the June Allison section where you lay on a table and someone pins you back and powders your bottom.  Can we see these panties that the 52-year-old thought were good for her?  Let's see the pretty young thing line or whatever the hell it's called. 
[01:01:30]  They're called Sexy Little Thing.  Sexy Little Thing.  She was trying that on?  Yes, sir.  Oh, good God.  Let's see.  Could you get the picture up on onaradio.com, please?  What was she trying in his underwear?  Oh, my God.  She has no business trying that on.  Get that off.  I think the, I know what happened.  The panties tried to escape from her body.  They said, no effing way.  I was made for young snakes.  You know, it just is. 
[01:02:00]  And you know who's to blame for this?  What?  Sex in the city.  Sex in the city.  Whatever the hell it's called.  That's what's to blame.  She probably saw the movie and was like, oh, I'm going to dress like Samantha.  Well, if Samantha could get away with the sexy little thing, I'm sure I can, too.  Oh, let me go to Vicky's.  I'm going to go in here.  Could I have something in a little low-rise thong? 
[01:02:30]  Maybe with something decorative on it that a man will look at and just go, wow.  Well, yeah.  Speaking of sexy little things.  Thanks.  Doesn't matter how little it is.  Yeah.  As long as he knows how to use it.  It's not going to be seen at long because it's coming off real quick.  Oh.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, they see that sex in the city and they think, oh, I got to go out now to Victoria's 
[01:03:00]  Secret at 57.  I can be sexy, too.  Yeah.  Samantha taught me that.  She's 50-something and banging the young guys.  Hi, I'm Macrida.  Can I buy you a drink?  I want to try something from your sexy little thing line.  Sexy little thing.  That's what she was trying on?  That can't be it.  We're trying to figure out which sexy little thing Macrida would try on.  You know what it was?  She didn't know it was a thong. 
[01:03:30]  She thought it was a fancy SARS mask.  That's how she poked her eyes.  A bejeweled SARS mask.  When Macrida came in, they should have said, no, we don't want you trying anything on from  the sexy little thing line.  But we do have a perfect line for you.  It's called the clump line.  The clump.  It's in the back of the store.  Way in the back.  Go through the clump rack.  There are some women you do see shopping there that you're just like, what are you doing? 
[01:04:00]  What are you doing?  Trying to reinvigorate that sex life with the hubby.  Let's get back to this.  Macrida Patterson, 52.  Let's say that line again.  Alleges that she was hurt last May by a defective low-rise V-string from the Victoria's Secret sexy little thing line.  Patterson's lawyer, Jason Bacott, said that a design problem caused a decorative piece to come loose  and strike Patterson in the eye, causing damage to her cornea. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe if you didn't have to stretch it out over a big fat ass.  Do we have a sound effect of stretching as Macrida tries on the sexy little thing panties?  Sexy little thing.  I bet if a sexy little thing is putting it on, it doesn't undergo stress like the cables on the Verrazano Bridge.  Right.  I think, yeah, if you're pulling this thing to get it on, things might pop off.  I imagine everyone in the store was like, get out of the way, it's going to blow!  Ducking behind racks of sexy little things. 
[01:05:00]  You hear movie ricochet sounds as it's bouncing off the wall before it hits her in the eye.  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  Let's say hi to Dano.  Dano in Kentucky.  Dano, you're the only one that is allowed to call with the name Dano.  Dano.  Hello, Dano.  Hey, good morning, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Yemi.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Hey, my wife has a, she has two ants, and these are highly unsexy, man. 
[01:05:30]  Uh, Dorcas and Zola.  Dorcas is, is a name?  It's in the Bible.  You believe that?  Who would curse the kid with that?  Her aunt's name is Dorcas?  Dorcas and Zola.  And Zola?  It's the other aunt, yeah.  Oh, Dorcas.  Oh, Dorcas. 
[01:06:00]  Dorcas.  That's what we call E-Rock.  He is a, of the family Dorcas.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Thank you, Dano.  Dorcas Mayonazos.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  And he doesn't even look up.  See, E-Rock, someone's talking about you.  Yes.  Now I see the brim of his hat just nodding up and down in disgust.  Max.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Max. 
[01:06:30]  I was just thinking that a thong that Macritta put on is kind of like trying to hold her  bunts back like the tie-down lines for the Hindenburg.  Oh, my God.  Tie-down lines.  Awful.  Very good.  Yeah, there's an age you reach where just stop it with the thong.  That's right.  30.  Stop it.  30.  They're claiming a design problem causes a decorative piece to come loose.  Design problem?  This isn't the shuttle.  It's a thong.  And strike Patterson in the eye causing damage to her cornea. 
[01:07:00]  How does that happen?  Embarrassing.  To her cornea.  Where are you looking?  What are you, rolling yourself up in a ball and rolling around the thing to see if you  can pull off that move you saw, Fatso?  Yeah.  How does it pop off and hit her in the eye?  Wonderful.  And the lawyer, of course.  There's the story.  They're doing it on Channel 5.  Maybe they'll show a picture of her.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  See, that's the way it's supposed to look.  Oh, yeah.  They're showing a nice young set of hips with a little thong pulled up. 
[01:07:30]  There's a lot of room between the belly button and the top of the thong.  Look at that birth canal.  That's not.  Jesus.  Look, the anchor wants to laugh.  Bonged by thong.  See, but they don't do a shock jock radio show, so they have to keep it serious.  Is that Mike Schmidt on Channel 11 today?  Mikey boy's in town, huh?  Huh?  He looks good.  Bonged by thong.  I want to see how Fox 5 is handling the story today, because I'm sure they have to be  very serious. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  They're kind of chuckling a little bit.  They should be chuckling.  Oh, now, look.  He's reaching down to touch her thong.  Shuffling the papers.  Always have a little fun statement.  Straighten them out, boys.  Shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle those papers when you're giggling.  Well, the lawyer's saying that Patterson is going to miss a few days of work, and she'll  be affected the rest of her life by this eye injury.  Stop it.  She will not.  Yeah.  I got to tell you something about this stupid IKEA thing.  They're getting more press on this than any dopey promotion I've seen. 
[01:08:30]  Every news agency is down there.  Look at this.  Both right now.  We're looking at 11-5 here in New York.  They're all down at this stupid IKEA.  That was the line for IKEA?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was to get tickets to the Kanye West show.  Yeah, well, some people want to freak out.  Oh, because I stumbled my way through that.  Yes, you barely made it.  You eked it out.  It could have been a good one.  I'm so dumb.  I almost said, where is he playing?  And I'm like, I looked up. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, I see.  Oh, I got you.  Idiot I am.  You guys want to know a little bit about the V-string line?  Yeah.  It's Victoria's Secret variant on the G-string, which has long been favored in the battle  against visible panty lines.  Of course, when girls wear nice clingy dresses, they don't want that panty line in the back.  You ever see the fat women wearing things and they get double ass?  I've talked about it, ass within the ass. 
[01:09:30]  Mini ass.  Yeah, they got the ass, which is from the hips down to the thighs.  You get that thing.  And then in the middle somewhere, forms this secondary-like quato from Total Recall ass  to whole nother ass.  Right.  Only smaller in the middle.  I guess the V-string line will take care of that or pop both of your eyes out.  Let's say hi to Brian in Sayerville before we take a break.  Brian, how are you today? 
[01:10:00]  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Welcome aboard, Brian.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, me and my buddy have been listening all year before school.  We're finally graduating today.  Does ONA have any words of wisdom?  Congratulations to you and your friend, Brian.  Words of wisdom.  I can tell you this much.  Wasted your time.  Not really.  You did.  For the last 18 years, you were made to feel important, and then you graduate high school  and realize you're just one of many.  One of many trying to make it.  What are you going to try to do now that you're done with college as far as a job? 
[01:10:30]  I have no idea.  All right.  Did well, then.  It's well worth it.  Are you going to college?  I don't know yet.  What do you want to do, though?  I have no idea.  High school.  I thought it was graduating college.  No, it's high school.  High school.  Oh, that's nothing.  Just take a couple of years off, smoke a lot of pot.  What was your dream growing up, Brian?  Sounds good.  Brian, what was your dream growing up?  I don't know. 
[01:11:00]  I kind of wanted to be a marine biologist when I was little.  That's a nice one.  My brother's that.  He makes about $8,000 a year.  He thought the same thing until he realized, wow, you really can't support four kids on  the marine biologist's pay.  Right.  Unless you're Jacques Cousteau.  You're not raking in any money.  Oh, he had big dreams.  And he's dead.  He did Seamesters.  He went to the University of Guam.  Seamesters?  Seamesters, my friend.  That's clever. 
[01:11:30]  Seamesters ruled.  He was telling me a story as we were going fishing out east this past Sunday where they're  catching live tuna during their Seamester and then eating it like sushi, just carving  it right on the boat.  It was the freshest sushi he's ever had in his life.  You sound like a very nice marine biologist.  Yeah, I know.  Really?  Then they caught a catfish and kicked its face and threw it back in.  I just love it.  We destroyed that coral reef.  We poured a little bit of oil on it.  And there was some wonderful wildlife that we just destroyed.  We pummeled. 
[01:12:00]  That's right.  We maimed a few stingrays.  We broke their little wings and threw them back in.  We put an anvil around a shark's neck.  And just dropped them back in the water.  I feel really sorry for people that graduated high school because I sort of said it, but we  ran over the line.  But basically, you feel important for 18 years.  And then you graduate high school and realize, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  You walk around with your varsity jacket because you're on one of the teams.  And everyone's like, wow, he plays for the high school football team. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  You were a big man on campus.  And now you're just no one out in the working world.  You've got the girl that does dance classes on the side.  And she's really good at her recitals.  And then she graduates high school.  And that all just goes away instantly.  It's a tough position to be in.  It's very tough to do marine biology, even though it's a noble profession.  But it's hard to segue that into a lot of money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's a fish.  Okay.  Give me my check. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know what the time is.  Who pays you?  Holding a little thing in your hand.  What is that, honey?  That is barnacle gold.  It's a new line of hats made of barnacles.  We're rich.  Barnacle hats.  Barnacle hats.  Barnacle underpants.  There's nothing you can do with it.  Hey, Brian, what's your friend's name?  Because he's going to want a little attention today.  Oh, Shane.  Shane.  All right.  Well, good luck to you guys.  I really don't know.  I mean, maybe we should have something to say to this. 
[01:13:30]  Join the military.  Hoorah.  Done.  You know what I would do?  18's a great age.  No responsibility.  You don't really have big bills yet.  You're not really a man yet.  It's the summer.  I would just, you and Shane.  Shane?  I would just take off and do a little cross-country trip.  Cool, guys.  What money, though?  With no money.  Who gives a crap?  Rob Banks.  You make money on the way somehow.  Here's what you guys are going to do.  Obi's kind of right.  But I would say before you go, you get a tent and you put it in the backyard and you watch 
[01:14:00]  Brokeback Mountain.  And you teach each other a lesson and you really do a little exploring before the summer's  over.  No?  Just an idea.  College boys.  Good idea.  Thanks, Jim.  Good luck, guys.  Yeah, right on, Brian.  All right.  Good luck to you, buddy.  Thank you.  Let's go to MK, a girl in Boston.  She's got a very good point about this Victoria's Secret story.  Yes, MK?  I want to know, in what Victoria's Secret are they letting McRiddle try on underwear in 
[01:14:30]  the store?  Well, don't they give you little paper panties that you put on first so nothing touches?  You're only supposed to try the bras on in the store and they size you up.  It's quite the experience.  But underwear, you just buy it and you go home.  You're not supposed to try it on in the store.  That's unfair.  Was she trying it on in the store?  No, this happened at home and in the comfort of her own home, it snapped off and hit her  in the eye.  You know what happened?  What?  Her husband was trying on the panties and stretched them to the limit and then that damn thing 
[01:15:00]  snapped and went flying into her eye.  But when he saw it, her husband wished to hit him in both eyes.  Gross.  I have to look at McRiddle.  McRiddle.  McRiddle.  Thank you, MK.  Hey, you're welcome, Mike.  Congrats on the Celtics thing, all right?  Hey, thanks.  You guys should have the sweep if the Pats would have won it.  Holy crap, what a year for Boston.  No.  What a year for Boston.  Two out of three ain't bad.  Yeah.  We would take that down here in New York. 
[01:15:30]  No problem.  Patriots choked and humiliated the whole city, but aside from that, you did not show up.  When did we have that?  We had Giants-Mets, didn't we?  We did it in...  One year, 86?  I think we did it in 70...  Oh, yeah, well, yeah, sure.  86, we had Giants-Mets.  But then we had the sweep in what?  What year?  72?  72?  What year?  We had Mets, Knicks, Jets, 69?  69 was Jets.  Tell me out there, Stump Brain.  Have the answer after the break.  69 Jets.  We did the sweep, right? 
[01:16:00]  I just know 69 Jets with Broadway Joe.  Was it 69 that we had the sweep here in New York?  Yeah.  We'll have the answer after this.  How's everybody doing?  Good.  I'm just fine.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about the boobies.  The boobie thing.  Still happening.  The boobies.  Boobies.  I took a picture, I think it was yesterday, of an old wow sticker from the WNEW days. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, you found one there.  Barely recognizable.  Barely.  Covered with exhaust and dust and ripping up from parallel parking.  It brought back memories, though.  Yeah.  That's when wow was really alive.  It's still happening.  It's just tougher to do when you do morning radio.  With the faithful listeners, they're still getting wowed out there.  They got their wow stickers.  Oh, yeah.  I see a lot of them every day.  You see the new ones, the old ones, the window clings? 
[01:17:00]  I see a little bit of all of them.  When we first started back after our little two-year hiatus, I saw a lot of old NEW stickers.  And those were fading out.  Saw a few of the XM ones.  And then a lot of the K-Rock ones.  Nice.  You can get one of those by going to onaradio.com.  And then for the other radio stations we're on, I hope they're doing the right thing and  pushing people to get their wow stickers on their website. 
[01:17:30]  I hope.  I hope they're doing that, at least.  All right.  Lots of things we could get to here.  We got Joan Rivers cursing on live TV.  TV.  I love Joan Rivers, man.  Yeah?  I would love it.  Yeah, even though we can't play the curse here, I just love how caustic she is.  All right.  We can do that.  Really fast.  Yes, I do remember the 69 Mets and Jets, but I was trying to remember if the Knicks won  it.  And I think the Knicks won it in 1970, which kept the streak alive, technically, but it  wasn't in the same year. 
[01:18:00]  That would have counted for the 70 season, because it crosses over.  Just like football now goes into the next year.  So the stats people say no.  But as far as the streak goes, New York had the Mets, the Jets, and the Knicks all in  a row.  Yeah, but it counts for 70, not 69, if you're hardcore.  And then, of course, you had the 86 thing with the Mets and the Giants.  But wait, hold on.  And then, what, 56, you had the Yankees and the Giants?  Yep.  Who cares?  No one was alive in 56.  What about 0-2? 
[01:18:30]  No, 19...  1914 was the first multiples, Toronto.  Ah, 1914.  That's good.  Wait, does it really count?  Doesn't it count what season it is?  Like, if it's the 1988 season or 89 season?  Because statistics, when they add up home runs at the end of the year, they don't break  them down by year.  They break them down by, well, the year 2000 season.  So wouldn't that be the championship, whatever season it was?  Yeah, but that season, baseball only covers one calendar year.  The other sports cross over, and they play the championship in the next year, and that's 
[01:19:00]  the year on the trophy.  It should be...  Oh, is it the year on the trophy?  Yeah, I think so.  But it should...  Maybe it says 88 slash 89, whatever it is.  But the hardcore, nutty about sports website has it listed this way.  Well, tell them to stop.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's call their supervisors.  Just stop it already.  All right, Joan Rivers cursing on live TV.  What show is this?  Some show over there in...  Across the Pond?  Like a British view.  A British view. 
[01:19:30]  Do you need a British version of the view?  Nah.  Bad teeth.  Nah.  Yes, Danny.  Well, how are you asking for the name of the show?  I do believe this is a British show called Loose Girls.  Loose Girls?  Well, how are they?  Hubba Hubba.  I see.  Loose Girls.  That's a nice double entendre.  Are they actually loose, or are they just...  I don't know.  They seem pretty uptight, the way they handle...  Yeah, really.  Not loose at all, right? 
[01:20:00]  No, it doesn't look like it.  Well, Joan Rivers, they asked her about, I don't know, talking about talking to celebrities  on the red carpet, and Joan Rivers had some nasty things to say about Russell Crowe, right?  No, yeah.  It was Russell Crowe, yeah.  Russell Crowe.  Is that part of your life that you enjoyed doing that, kind of meeting and greeting the  celebrities on the red carpet?  When they're nice.  Yeah.  And we know what we're saying.  Yeah.  You get someone like Russell Crowe, and you want to say to the camera, he is a piece of 
[01:20:30]  get ready to bleep this.  We haven't got a bleeper.  We haven't got a bleeper.  You wanker.  Haven't got a bleeper.  They won't get in any trouble.  It's England, for God's sake.  They can say whatever they want over there, can't they?  Right?  There's nude people on television. 
[01:21:00]  It is the BBC, though.  Yes.  The BBC.  I love Joan Rivers, man.  She doesn't care who she offends.  She's everything a comic should be.  She's just brilliantly funny, and she's just vicious.  She is vicious.  I watched her set.  It was an hour.  It could be the most vicious set I've ever seen a set of.  Wow, really?  She does not play games.  9-11 jokes, AIDS jokes.  It's not to be cruel, either.  It's just for her as a comic, everything is fair game. 
[01:21:30]  And it was a beautiful thing to watch.  She just stood there for an hour with basically a verbal mace and bashed people in the face.  Everybody.  She was terrific.  That's great.  We're getting the video up on onaradio.com.  It continues.  God bless her.  We're live.  We're live.  We're live.  We're live.  We're live.  We're live.  Oh, we're here.  Sorry about that.  We do apologize.  Joan wasn't aware that we were absolutely live, and we do apologize.  Now we're going to end, allegedly.  Because he's going to sing with every fight. 
[01:22:00]  Not to mention the mother that's saying to her four-year-old now.  Now these words are...  These words are words that mommy now has to wear a big vest.  I'm lost.  Now listen.  The reason...  She...  You know, and I know it's the hacky thing to say about her and the plastic surgery, but  my God.  She just looks bizarre. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  There is a bizarre look to her.  She doesn't need it.  It's like...  The thing about Joan is like, no one cared if you were beautiful or not.  You're so funny.  Look at...  She's trying to laugh, and she's like...  It looks painful to watch her.  It looks painful.  She put her head back to laugh, and her lip went like...  She's going to rip.  A little bit here and there, you know, fine.  But you got to know when to stop.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at her face.  She passed the point where she should stop. 
[01:23:00]  They put all kinds of, like, chin implants and cheek things and collagen and stretching  and...  Oh, my God.  But she does make fun of it in that commercial.  The beauty of her...  She talks about it.  Yeah, but I know.  That's one thing, though.  But, you know.  This is a $100,000 face she said on stage.  She makes fun of it and all, but look at her right there.  She's trying to laugh.  She can't...  She cannot laugh.  Plastic surgery scares me because my face is my face, and when I get a haircut, I get 
[01:23:30]  all freaked out, like...  Imagine them doing something to your face.  I get freaked out if I cut my hair too short or something, because I'm like, wait a minute,  I don't look like me anymore.  Yeah.  Like, I can't imagine waking up and all of a sudden having a completely different face.  All of a sudden, your eyes are all screwy.  It's like, someone can't go, oh, your eyes...  Don't worry.  Six months, it'll grow back the way it was.  Yeah, exactly.  No, now your eyes are all screwy.  For the haircut, it will grow back, but you get used to your face, whatever it is.  You know, ugly, good, whatever.  Nothing's worse than when they do their eyes and one looks different than the other. 
[01:24:00]  They're pulled back like almost Asian, but kind of crooked.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  What is she doing?  Take the wrinkles.  Yeah.  What has she done?  It's not bad.  Take the wrinkles.  Because that doesn't make a guy go, wow, she looks great, I want to go out with her.  Any more than he would if she was just her own age and had wrinkles.  Like, a guy, if he wants to go out with her, is going to go out with her. 
[01:24:30]  That is a bizarre look.  That's like a monster.  Remember that Weinstein, Wildenstein?  She's starting to get that look to her, though.  That weird where your face, the muscles in your face can't pull and work anything because there's so much crap in the way.  Implants and everything else.  So you can't smile anymore.  Remember when Cher went through that phase where she couldn't move her mouth? 
[01:25:00]  She was like a ventriloquist.  Yeah.  She would talk and you wouldn't see her lips move.  Her eyes couldn't move.  Nothing.  How do you fall asleep at night?  Sonny had more expression after the tree.  How does one fall asleep at night if he can't close your eyes?  Yeah.  You just got to lay there and have a servant put drops in your eyes so they don't dry out overnight.  Oh, they can't close their eyes?  Sometimes.  Sometimes they screw them up completely.  What do they do?  Oh, you wake up and go, ow.  Well, are you ready for your George Takai update? 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  We can't get enough of this guy.  How's the honeymoon?  Well, this is what we got on George Takai.  Star Trek star George Takai to marry partner.  We said this yesterday.  We thought he was going to be married by now.  I thought he was first on line with my boyfriend right behind me.  Get it?  He got his marriage license.  Plans to wed long-time partner in September.  I love him long time.  Star Trek star George Takai is ready to live long and prosper. 
[01:26:00]  Star Trek reference.  No, you didn't.  I do the...  You little devil.  We do the Vulcan live long and prosper sign and then give each other the shocker.  Even though, you know, you can't really.  We kind of, you know, dock.  Dock in shock.  One in the pink, one in the sink.  To live long and prosper with his partner of 21 years, Takai will marry 54-year-old Brad 
[01:26:30]  Altman.  He's a chippy.  On September 14th in Los Angeles.  The 71-year-old actor known for his role as, of course, blah, blah, blah, was the first  to pay $70 for a marriage license in West Hollywood early Tuesday.  Uh, the marriage license is good for 90 days.  Takai was jubilant, uh, jubilant, saying it's, uh, going to be jubilant is going to be the  only, it's going to be the only day like this in our lives.  And it is the only day like this in the history of America. 
[01:27:00]  What?  He told reporters, and a swelling.  Yes, swelling.  Crowd.  Swelling.  Outside the West Hollywood City Auditorium.  May equality live long and prosper.  Oh, he didn't.  Does he have to throw a Star Trek reference in with everything?  I don't know why.  Stop.  Yes.  Why would he do that?  I'm going to beam into his a**hole. 
[01:27:30]  How about we both love bones?  Yes, where's bones?  Wish I knew more about that dumb show.  I know.  Those are the sounds I'm going to make on the honeymoon.  They're going to sound just like this.  I'll hit all these notes as I'm biting a pillow.  I don't do his voice, but I like when my boyfriend puts his rotten berries on my nose. 
[01:28:00]  Good luck to the happy old couple.  God, they love...  It's just a bunch of old queens and old lesbians that are getting married.  They've been with each other for years.  You don't see these young gay people getting married.  Yeah.  They're not the ones stepping up.  Look at him.  Hi.  Look at where my hand is.  So close. 
[01:28:30]  So close and yet so far.  He's giving the old back of the knuckle helmet bump.  Yes.  Well, that's wonderful.  All right, listen.  Who knew?  Who knew?  Who knew he was gay?  Probably Shatner and everyone else on the set.  You have to think everybody did.  Everyone on the set knew.  What's he been with this guy for 20 years?  So during some of the movie filming and everything, he must have been there.  Oh, George, you're doing such a great job. 
[01:29:00]  You ever watch reruns of the old sitcoms we grew up watching?  Yeah.  And go, wow, I was too young to realize that that person was gay.  A little flamboyant?  Yeah.  I hope you didn't mean like Paul Lynde.  When I was six, I was like, hey, dad, that guy's a fruit.  I had no clue.  Oh, Paul Lynde.  That man's a lady.  He wants to be a girl, doesn't he, daddy? 
[01:29:30]  I honestly didn't know and I hated Paul Lynde because he made fun of Kiss on the 19th, 1976  Paul Lynde Halloween special.  Stop it.  I didn't know and he was making, I was eight.  And Gene Simmons was there and he said something.  He goes, oh, why don't you go down in your elevator shoes?  I had no idea.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, he said that?  Yeah.  Go up, Iraq.  Click on this picture.  Why does that look like me in the Paul Lynde picture?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It's not there.  Is that you? 
[01:30:00]  No, it's not me.  Are you in a Paul Lynde picture?  No, look at that.  Oh, baby.  Wow, wait.  Wow.  That looks like a...  From here, that looks just like you.  That is freaking me out.  That's how I used to wear my hair and everything.  Maybe it's you and you didn't know who you were talking to.  What the...  Who is that?  I don't know.  There's a picture of a guy from a distance that looks exactly like me and it's an old  school picture of...  Charles Nelson Riley.  Charles Nelson Riley.  Come here, Opie.  And Paul Lynde. 
[01:30:30]  Take a picture.  You gotta do a split screen if you throw this up.  And Paul Lynde.  Throw this up on onaradio.com.  How creepy is that?  Who's your lady, Opie?  I wasn't in this picture, Jimmy.  This picture's 20-some-odd years old.  It's gotta be you.  You're a twink.  That is creepy, man.  Right?  Yeah, that's a little...  Not how I...  I used to have my hair like that.  I used to have the Ellen DeGeneres.  The Ellen DeGeneres.  The Ellen DeGeneres.  The Ellen DeGeneres.  Alright, listen. 
[01:31:00]  We'll put that up on onaradio.com.  Yeah, pop that up.  That's a famous picture.  We had Big A in recently doing...  Big A.  ...like karaoke and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  We're gonna do track six there, Erock.  I'm gonna make your job very easy today.  Oh, boy.  We should do that every day.  No kidding.  Big A attempting to sing Stand By Me.  This is worth another play.  He stutters, Opie.  He stutters a little bit.  He doesn't even know when to come in.  Isn't it more than a stutter that he has?  Yeah.  Like, it's this...  I can't even describe it. 
[01:31:30]  It's like a...  A stutter is when you...  Like...  Hamina, hamina, hamina.  Yeah, no, there's something else going on there.  You get some kind of neurological problem.  What he has is called...  It's called the whiny, severed brain stem.  Like, instead of having a solid brain stem,  and his is just...  It's like with a piece of gristle  being held onto his spine.  A blithering yutz-itis.  Here's Big A, Jimbo. 
[01:32:00]  Attempting Stand By Me.  Very creepy rendition.  When the night has come,  and the land is dark, 
[01:32:30]  and the moon is the only light we'll see,  no, I won't be afraid.  No, I won't be afraid.  And the piss I won't let you see.  Stand by me.  Stand by me.  And darling, darling,  stand by me.  Not even close. 
[01:33:00]  Stand by me.  Stand by me.  Stand by me.  If the sky that we look upon  should tumble and fall  should tumble and fall,  and all the mountains  should crumble to the sea.  I won't cry.  I won't cry.  No, I won't shed a tear.  Just as long as you  stand by me. 
[01:33:30]  Stand by me.  And darling, darling,  Stand by me. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, stand by me.  Stand by me  Whenever you're in trouble  Would you stand by me  Stand by me  Oh, stand by me  Stand by me 
[01:34:30]  Oh, stand by me  Oh, stand by me  Stand by me  Token Black fan writes from Boston.  Wow, he's a brave man.  This is the song Big A sings  while he never severed head in the bathtub. 
[01:35:00]  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, Mike Birbiglia.  We love Mike, man.  How are you, Mike?  I'm good. How are you doing?  Very, very good.  I'm just looking at your dates here.  Comedy Central Summer Stage in New York City, June 20th.  When is that?  This Friday night.  In Central Park?  Yeah, it's free.  Holy crap.  Free?  Yeah.  What part of the park?  I don't know.  Wherever Summer Stage is.  I don't know.  Probably not the 110th Street.  Oh, Summer Stage.  Okay, yeah.  That's a nice little venue there 
[01:35:30]  in the middle of Central Park.  I hear you're playing with an old friend of ours,  Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch, yeah.  Should be a good one.  How about Stephen comes in and says hi to us?  Well, actually, he's coming back from Europe right now,  so that might be why.  What is he doing in Europe?  He was touring Europe.  He's really big in Europe, I guess.  He's big everywhere.  Yeah, he's big everywhere,  but I heard he was selling a lot of tickets there.  He's blowing up.  Look how easily we get our feelings hurt, though.  Babies.  These guys in Europe were like,  everybody has to call back. 
[01:36:00]  We'd like hanging with our friends.  I was with Jim and Bonnaroo.  I heard you guys were talking about that this morning.  Yeah.  It was good.  Yeah.  I didn't see any Mike shows.  Are you with Janine, right?  Uh-huh.  Did you like Bonnaroo?  What's your thoughts on Bonnaroo?  I liked it.  I was trying to manipulate it so that I would be cool and have a good time because I've  done it before, and I always end up feeling like a loser no matter what, like stoned in  a corner being like, why does everyone hate me? 
[01:36:30]  You know, like it never goes well.  And so this year I rented a bus.  Okay.  And I actually called Jim and asked him to go in on it.  He never called me back.  And in addition to that, I get the bus and I'm like, I'll have a bus.  It'll be cool.  I'll have a home base.  I can take naps.  It ends up just being me in the huge 45-foot bus alone, smoking pot in the corner going,  why does everyone hate me?  So it kind of backfired.  Wait, you rented a tour bus to go to Bonnaroo? 
[01:37:00]  Did you drive it all the way out there?  From Nashville.  We rented it out of Nashville because there's a lot.  So you flew to Nashville, then rented the bus to go to Bonnaroo.  It seems like it would be cool to just take the bus from New York and really experience  the ride all the way to Tennessee.  It would seem that way.  I tend to not do things the right way.  I was coming from Raleigh, North Carolina, so it didn't make sense.  But at one point, because I was like, I'll get the bus, it'll be a communal thing, you 
[01:37:30]  know, Norton will come on, and Louis C.K. is there, and all these people.  No one comes on, it's just me on the bus.  It was like my own Citizen Kane of touring.  And then at one point, Louis comes on, and I'm like, oh, Louis's coming on.  He goes, hey, you mind if I take a crap on your bus?  I'm like, hey.  Gee, thanks.  I feel bad, but that's like the only thing you can't do on the bus.  You can't crap on the bus.  Oh, yeah, it stinks the whole bus up.  Yeah.  There's no real ventilation there. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And then you've got to kind of like remove Louis C.K.'s from your bus.  Yeah, exactly.  That can't be pleasant.  Yeah.  Well, Louis, I didn't go on.  Mike and I talked once.  I think the second, we didn't talk again because I realized, like, I knew, I found out my show  schedule, I had one long day, which I did one at 6 p.m. and then one at midnight, and  the next day I did back-to-back shows, so I wouldn't have been spending time on it.  But I didn't go on.  This is Jimmy making an excuse.  No, it might not. 
[01:38:30]  He's just not a good friend.  That's true.  He's just not a good friend.  You should have went on his bus.  I felt guilty.  You could have played, what did you have, a little, like, Xbox or PlayStation 3 or something?  Sure, yeah.  A DVD player.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you should have went.  Plasma screen TV.  I didn't want a little dope with Mike Birbiglia.  Well, then Rocky is telling us that Mike loves it down here.  She's like, thank you, good placement.  He's got a tick.  I know that.  All right.  Why wouldn't you put it here?  One of our interns has a tick, so. 
[01:39:00]  And he's a good boy.  It's just good that he was able to put the coffee down on the console without spilling it  ever.  Not spill it all over you.  He's a nervous boy.  It's kind of nice.  But I'm talking, I'm looking at Ope Ant and Mike, and he puts down coffee, and he just  stands right in my sight line and drops coffee.  There's four feet of counter space behind it.  He's got to stand in front of you while you're talking to somebody.  Next time, just open it and throw it in my face.  And that just got Kenny upset.  Kenny.  I'd better go talk to him and straighten him out.  He'll be reprimanded.  Don't you worry, Jimmy.  With a phone book. 
[01:39:30]  I'll take care of it.  Well, he's not like Kenny, at least.  Goon.  Kenny.  This is what you hear with Kenny after he goes for an egg run.  Did you hear that in the studio?  That's Kenny with his giant bag full of things.  Kenny was at Bonnaroo.  Kenny was at Bonnaroo.  Was he just creeping everybody out?  I was in the, they had an area for the comics, and at one point someone looked at me and  they go, does Norton have a bodyguard?  And I had to be like, yeah, it's complicated.  It's a long story. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, Kenny does my roach, though.  He takes care of everything.  Me and Mr. Borbiglia had a moment.  What was the moment?  What was the moment?  In the, you know, the comedy tent trailer, you know, like the green room, we were sitting  having a nice conversation, because, you know, I'm working on my social skills, and  all of a sudden, he's doing pretty good.  Mr. Borbiglia blamed the smell on me.  Oh.  I want to say publicly, sir, whoever smelt it, dealt it.  Wow.  Oh, boy. 
[01:40:30]  Face.  That's the oldest trick in the book.  No, I didn't, I didn't assign blame to you, Kenny.  I asked you politely, and then I exited the room.  Hey, Kenny has been working on his social skills.  Show him what you, you know, start a conversation.  A little conversation to start from Club Soda Kenny.  This is how good he's gotten.  Sounds good.  How are you today, Mr. Borbiglia?  I'm good, thanks, Kenny, I appreciate it.  You're looking well.  Oh, thanks, you're looking very well as well.  Why, thank you, Mr. Borbiglia. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, wow.  God.  This is getting more and more like the Addams family.  And?  Yeah.  That's it.  That was good.  What are your plans for today, sir?  I thought they'd maybe take a walk in the park, you know.  Right?  Are you plugging anything?  Where are you appearing this weekend?  I'm at Central Park.  I mentioned that earlier.  Summer Stage, Central Park, Friday.  I hate to bring up something Jimmy brought up the other day, but it's like the conversation  between Sling Blade and his girlfriend there at the dinner table.  Howie, you want to go for a walk? 
[01:41:30]  I'd like it if you could get the satellite navigation with Kenny.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a good one.  Make a left.  A left.  Stop at the Denny's.  That's what the directions that I'm holding says.  Make a left.  He won't get like a tom-tom or one of those navigation things.  He prints out the directions and holds his finger on the next place to go on the directions.  With his thumb.  With his thumb.  And he refuses to move it down until he's completed that direction. 
[01:42:00]  And then once that is it, then he goes to the next one and holds that.  It's like they make navigation systems now.  I started a new game with Kenny.  Like, you know, I'll give him some mail or whatever in the morning or other things that  need to be given to people.  I'm starting to get as much stuff as I possibly can because what I found out with Kenny, whatever  you hand him, he cannot put down in his car.  He has to hold all the way to the station.  Oh, wow.  You've got to give him plates and sticks.  So he starts juggling.  I've gotten him. 
[01:42:30]  Give him a beehive.  I've gotten him where he drives his car with his thumb and his index finger because he's  using the rest of that right hand to hold, like, CDs and stuff.  He won't put it down.  And then he's got mail in this hand.  Oh, is that classic.  One morning he came down with a shredder and I was all confused.  He didn't know what to do.  So he put it on his lap.  I'm like, Kenny, you've got this big, huge SUV.  Put it somewhere else in the car.  He has to hold it.  He's a safekeeper.  It's the weirdest thing.  Does he have a navigation system in there?  My next vehicle that I purchase will have a GPS. 
[01:43:00]  Like, Kenny's one of those guys, if you had a boat and everybody's got the radar and everything,  he'd still be looking at the stars with that little scope thing.  We have to go due north.  It's the bright star.  Speaking of bright stars, there's a full moon tonight.  Get out.  I think.  Boo!  Let's say hi to Pat in Belmore.  Pat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm actually calling from the Big Easy today.  I was in the studio last Friday and I said hello to Kenny and asked him how he was and 
[01:43:30]  he looked at me as if I were a microscope slide.  He just stared at you, right?  Yeah, a little bit of curiosity.  Not quite revulsion.  Come on, our guest, Kenny, is sitting down there.  Yeah, Kenny decided, screw Mike Birbiglia.  This is his time to shine.  I need to sit on the guest couch and discuss things.  It's Kenny and Mike Birbiglia.  We're like a team. 
[01:44:00]  Really?  It is the worst comedy team I've ever heard.  A team.  Kenny just shows up all tall wearing tan.  Yeah.  Wow.  Kenny's going to show up at summer stage.  We're all ready to laugh.  I make good introductions.  Well, you've got to give him that.  Give Mike a big introduction.  But you've got to know something about him.  So let's see what you've got.  What's your Mike Birbiglia knowledge?  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  And welcome to Central Park Summer Stage, where tonight we proudly present... 
[01:44:30]  I wasn't ready.  Live in concert.  Richard, the one, the only, the most handsomeness, the funniest, the wittiest, the cutest.  The guy who has to sleep in a sleeping bag so he doesn't kill himself.  Yeah, the guy who likes to sleep in a sleeping bag.  With oven mitts.  With oven mitts.  So he can't unzip the sleeping bag.  What he said, please put your hands together and give a warm New York welcome to Mr. Michael Birbiglia. 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  That's, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get out.  That's my WWE entrance.  Yeah.  So back to Bonnera.  So you're smoking pot in the tour bus by yourself.  In the bus and all by myself.  And did you, Jim, did you get to talk to any musicians who you like?  No, I was backstage for Metallica.  Did you see Eddie Vedder come back? 
[01:45:30]  No, I heard he...  He came back to the comedy tent.  I might not have been there the day he did.  He came back Friday afternoon.  I think I hadn't landed yet.  Because they told me he had come back, but I knew I hadn't been there.  He's friends with Janine, right?  Yeah.  And I had not been there for your shows and her shows.  But Mike loves Bonnera.  Like, Rocky was telling me that Mike loves it.  She's like, he'll go out with a knapsack and just, like, dig the bands.  So it was like, when he was staying on the bus, I'm like, that's a smart move.  Instead of trucking back to the hotel, he likes to probably just hang out, party,  watch the bands and do his gigs.  Sounds like the only way to do it.  Yeah.  But he parked it right behind the comedy tent.  It was a smart thing to do.  I used to love going to Grateful Dead shows and, like, just wander around the parking lot 
[01:46:00]  for hours and hours and hours.  I mean, you want to talk about people watching.  I used to do that when I was in high school.  I would go to these concerts at Great Woods because I grew up in Shrewsbury, Mass.  And I had...  You know, when you're in high school, you have no identity.  I was like, didn't know who I was.  So I started wearing a cowboy hat.  So then I was like, oh, I'm the cowboy hat guy.  So they were like, hey, it's the cowboy hat guy.  I had no identity whatsoever other than the cowboy hat guy. 
[01:46:30]  This festival, I was the bus guy.  The bus guy.  I was the bus guy, yeah.  With no friends.  With no friends, yeah.  Oh, you always look for something to make you Mike the...  Okay, I get it, yeah.  Yeah.  It was like my Larry the Cable guy kind of identity.  Yeah.  Mike the bus guy tonight.  You know, Kenny was needed, though, because I actually wound up doing this hour...  Actually, it was a two-hour thing for Fuse.  It would hopefully get whittled down to an hour.  I'm interviewing people at Bonnaroo, but the Bonnaroo experience...  And, you know, Kenny was certainly needed because, you know, you're just in the middle 
[01:47:00]  of this field with the camera.  A little wild.  Drunken animals.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  A lot of ONA fans, yeah, but they're just drunken.  They're just animals.  They should be animals at Bonnaroo.  ONA fans are nuts.  You know, last time I was on the show, I got hate mail that I had disrespected  Rich Voss.  This guy goes...  Wow.  You disrespected Rich Voss.  It was a sign, Rich Voss.  RV retard at gmail.com.  I couldn't help but in my brain read it as, you disrespected Rich Voss.  Rich Voss. 
[01:47:30]  I'm picturing this army of stutterers.  You were just jumping on the pile that was going on that day.  Did you do an impression of somebody?  I heard someone said Mike did an impression of...  Who did you do an impression of?  Burr.  I think Burr.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You weren't here for that?  That one was...  Wow.  I hate to put you on the spot, but maybe just a few seconds of Bill Burr.  I don't even know what...  Well, he called me...  He always calls me...  He'll call me like once every three months, and it'll always be about some obvious business  thing.  He'll be like, hey, Mike. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, Bill Burr here.  Just calling to see what's going on with the internet.  I mean, is this...  What is this all about?  Does this help you get people to your shows?  Or what is this MySpace?  I want to get my Facebook.  I want to get on my Facebook.  What's Twitter?  You know what Twitter is?  That's a good impression of him.  Hell yeah, dude.  Totally, Bill. 
[01:48:30]  Last time Mike was in town, he played Carolines, and he did the one-man show.  I went to that show.  Sleepwalk with me.  Sleepwalk with me was amazing.  Oh, you saw it?  He made it funny as hell.  Yeah, it's a serious thing.  I mean, the guy does have to sleep in a sleeping bag with mitts on, so he doesn't unzip the  sleeping bag, because he has some of that sleepwalking that you don't remember doing.  And he told the story on the show where he jumped out of a hotel window from the second  floor and survived.  Anyway, he turned it into a one-man show.  I got to tell you, it was great.  Thanks, man.  People were creeped out, but then they started laughing along. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, are we supposed to be laughing?  I mean, this seems like really funny material, but I don't know if I'm supposed to laugh.  Yeah.  And then they got comfortable, and they went with it, and it was great, man.  It was really, really good.  Do you get into a sleeping bag during the show?  We'll put the oven mitts on?  No.  Comfortable visual.  Maybe I could do that.  That would be a great ending.  Like, this is actually how I actually sleep, for real.  I like that.  And then have someone carry you off stage.  Kenny would do it for you.  People would be so creeped out, go, all right, you guys were laughing along and stuff, and  let me show you how it is, and then bring out the sleeping bag and someone that has 
[01:49:30]  to tape the mitts on you.  Do you tape the mitts on or no?  No, no, no.  What do you do?  You get in, you zip it up, and then you just put them on.  Yeah.  It's more like a sleep sack, like you get at Eastern Mountain Sports, you know, or like  a thin kind of thing, and you zip it up to your neck.  It's right up to theirs.  Can you really sleep that way?  Yeah, it's pretty comfortable.  Things are actually working out great, guys.  I sleep in a sleeping bag with mittens, and my life is fantastic.  What do you do on a plane? 
[01:50:00]  I just, you know, put my seatbelt on.  It's crazy.  I mean, I'll give you-  What does he do on a plane?  He drinks a lot of coffee.  Yeah, exactly.  He doesn't dare fall asleep.  Next thing you know, there's going to be a bullet to the back of his head from some  agent that happens to be on the freaking plane.  I'll, uh, I have one story.  This is before I got diagnosed.  I was living with my girlfriend, and we fell asleep watching the movie Fight Club, and  I had a dream.  You know that Edward Norton, when he gets his hand held down by Brad Pitt, he's going to  put acid on it? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Lie on it, yeah.  And I had a dream that that was my hand, and so I sprinted out of the apartment, and  I threw a chest of drawers in my wake, because I knew that Brad Pitt is very cunning, and  in my brain, I was in an action film, and then I sprinted down the hall, I hit the elevator  button, my girlfriend comes out, and she's like, Michael, you're sleeping!  I'm like, but Brad Pitt was a-  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I'm so sorry.  Oh, God. 
[01:51:00]  Damn.  Yeah, and I had a lot of incidents like that before I had, like, this really extreme one  that I talk about at length in the show, where I essentially jumped out a window.  Ran right out of a window.  Can you imagine?  Running start and everything.  Like a cartoon character.  Why wouldn't-  And then hit the ground and kept running.  Why wouldn't-  Until he woke up.  Why wouldn't you, though, if the man was going to put lie on your hand, why wouldn't you  just go into the bathroom and put some cool water on it?  Water will make it worse.  You're really smart.  You've got to put vinegar on it.  Who has that in a dream?  Well, that's what happens in the movie. 
[01:51:30]  You should doze off with a douche on your bed.  Yeah.  But-  But-  How many girls have said that when they're with you?  Let's go for the douche.  Never, because I don't stay.  What do you hear?  I cuddle afterwards.  I apologize for the fast finish, and I am-scray.  The lackluster performance.  Oh, the awful, the in-and-out, you know, the flaccid-  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry, Jim. 
[01:52:00]  You all right?  Uh-huh.  The-  But anyway, the show is-  I talk about the sleepwalking thing, because I was in denial about it for a long time.  Like, I-  You know how you have little things wrong with you, and you're like, maybe I should see  a doctor, and then you're like, maybe I'll eat dinner.  And I just went with dinner over and over again for years.  And, like, I do that with a lot of things in my life, like relationships, particularly.  Like, I was in-  At that time, I was in a relationship for a long time with, like, my college sweetheart,  and I knew that she wanted to get married, but I knew that I wasn't ready to get married, 
[01:52:30]  but I wouldn't say it.  You know, I'd be like, maybe we should break up, and then I'd be like, maybe I'll eat dinner.  And I just kept not dealing with it, and it just got worse and worse, and I ended up  cheating and doing bad stuff, and then it's just kind of a bad-  She bust you?  No, no.  It just was one of these things I just felt awful about, and then eventually-  That's how my marriage was, though.  It was the same thing.  It was like, yeah, well, you know, maybe I'll face this and confront the fact that I'm miserable,  and, you know, the socks and stuff, and went on for, like, nine years. 
[01:53:00]  Nine years?  Nine years.  Nine years?  I just put it off.  Were you married for nine years?  Wow.  Yeah.  Can you believe that?  Yeah.  A waste of my goddamn time.  Yeah.  Because, you know, eh, I got a cool gig.  You know, that was it.  I'd just gotten into radio, so I had, you know, I was coming in, doing radio and hanging  out, so the marriage part and having to deal with her, it was nothing.  I'd drive home at night, I'd, like, douse myself in Captain Morgan and Cokes, and then 
[01:53:30]  go to bed.  Yeah.  You know, play a few video games.  Have her yell at me for playing video games, and then go to bed.  And that was pretty much the last few years, until, God, what was the straw that finally  broke the camel's back?  It was something really subtle.  Oh, I brought my girlfriend home.  Yeah.  Yeah, that pretty much ends your marriage.  That was the anvil that broke the camel's back.  The thing for me was, my thing was that we went to my brother's wedding, and they asked 
[01:54:00]  us to be in these photos.  My mom was like, oh, come and be in this photo.  Do you want Abby in the photo?  And I said, yes, but not fast enough.  Oh, no.  Yeah, and then later that night, she was like, Michael, like, when are we getting married?  And what I should have said was, can we talk about this next summer?  And what I did say was, next summer.  Oh, no.  And she called everyone we knew and told them we were getting married, and that's how I 
[01:54:30]  got engaged without getting engaged.  Wow.  We were, like, literally planning this wedding, and I have, we talked about this last time  or a few times ago, where I have shortness of breath when I get nervous, where I feel  like I can't breathe.  Can't draw full breath.  Yeah, and then I feel like I'm going to die, because, like, breathing is one of the building  blocks of living.  So, I had that.  Did you have that?  Were you nervous?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In the marriage?  Yeah, I feel like I got, like, pushed into it, too. 
[01:55:00]  It was one of those things where I was just on a roller coaster.  I got on, and just tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, and I was done.  I had no control.  The bar's down, and you're along for the ride.  Yeah.  You want to scream, please stop.  Let me off.  Yeah.  But you have dinner instead.  Yeah, you go to dinner.  You go and have dinner.  Amazing.  It's one of those situations, and before I knew it, I'm in front of a justice of the peace,  and he's saying these words, and then all of a sudden, I'm married.  So, you eloped?  No, the family was there and everything. 
[01:55:30]  It was very close.  We didn't have one of those big weddings, but it was good enough of a wedding to hold  up in court.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  But I was miserable.  You've got to understand, it wasn't that big of a wedding.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was nothing.  Trying to explain it.  Oh, please.  I'm trying to look into the credentials of the guy that did the wedding and be like,  you know, was he really?  Hired a private investigator.  Could he really perform weddings? 
[01:56:00]  Did he pass the course?  Was he a captain of a ship?  What was he?  My parents have been married for 40 years.  Wow.  Yeah, and it's not good.  Well, no, not because of them.  It's just that I don't think that people who invented marriage intended for marriage to  last that long.  Like, when people invented marriage, people only lived to be 40.  Right.  It's like, if they knew about this, they wouldn't approve at all.  They'd be like, when were they married?  As babies?  You know?  I don't approve of babies marrying one another. 
[01:56:30]  We've got to take a quick break.  Mike Birbiglia, Summer Stage, Central Park, Friday.  With Stephen Lynch, right?  Yeah.  It's going to be huge.  Anybody else there?  I think Julian McCullough's opening up the show.  Oh, Julian's funny.  He's a funny guy.  Oh, very cool.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  We have also, Mike, June 25th.  We're on in Cleveland.  He'll be at Hilarities, celebrating the release of his new DVD.  It's What I Should Have Said Was Nothing, which is in stores now, actually.  Doing very well on iTunes. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, okay.  So it's not a way to humiliate me.  Right?  Yeah, we're doing well.  Oh, sorry.  I'm teasing.  Just wanted to give him some props there.  I'm an idiot.  He wanted to give me some props after I told him who was on Summer Stage, and he goes,  Who else?  Anybody else on that?  That's it?  Like, who's surrounding you to kind of make this a real...  Yeah, so June 25th, he'll be at Hilarities in Cleveland.  We got someone not happy.  Lisa, Long Island, what's up?  Maybe we could talk this out. 
[01:57:30]  Humor is in the worst taste I have ever heard of.  I can't believe the choice of humor.  Do you think that's funny?  Yes.  You think that's intelligent?  Make a pie, bud.  Make a pie.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  With one of our newer friends to the O.B. and Anthony Show, Mike Birbiglia.  Slowly but surely becoming a regular to the show.  Playing Summer Stage, Central Park, Friday with the great Stephen Lynch. 
[01:58:00]  Anyone else?  Anyone else?  On that show?  Yeah, but then I came back strong and said, I saw you at Caroline's, and I was blown away.  So, I gave you some compliments and knocked you down a peg or two at the same time.  Yeah, that's fine.  I'm an idiot.  The average is that.  877-212-ON-A.  Mike Birbiglia is a big Celtics fan, so you must be pretty happy this morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, I...  What's up with Boston and comedians?  Every comedian that does our show, just about, is from Boston. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you got Byrd, DiPaolo, Patrice O'Neal, Robert Kelly.  Colin Quinn spent some time in Boston.  Colin Quinn tried to fit in with the Boston crowd with an accent.  Because he knew that was a hotbed of activity back in the day.  I went to Boston.  I thought I was going to be huge.  It was terrible.  It was like a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation.  It was the worst Colin Quinn.  Well, they ran him out of town, not because of his material, but because of the accent.  He's from New York, yeah.  Because of the accent.  He had to go back to New York with his comedy. 
[01:59:00]  To New York.  Yeah, I'm from Boston.  I was a big Sox and Celtics fan growing up, but I watched the...  I think I watched, what was it, Game 5 the other night?  But I...  But yeah, I don't follow it closely enough to know details, so I always end up in these conversations  where I have to just kind of nod and agree when people...  Like, I'll talk to DiPaolo, and I'll be like, oh, you see the Celtics game?  And then everything he says seems like it's in Chinese after that point.  And then I'm like, yeah, yeah, totally. 
[01:59:30]  Totally.  All that Chinese crap you just said.  I totally agree with that.  I always have to pretend that I've...  I end up saying in my life, no, but I heard about it a lot.  No, but I heard about it means I haven't heard about it, but I like you.  I enjoy your company.  That's a great out.  We all use that one.  No, but I heard about it.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Yeah.  You shouldn't say no, but I heard about that in the same sentence.  Why can't people just be honest and go, no, I didn't see it.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[02:00:00]  No idea.  Because then I guess the conversation ends, and it becomes very awkward.  Yeah.  So you got to go, yeah, yeah, no, that's kind of, yeah.  Sure, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard something about that.  I heard about that.  Your voice gets real high.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I heard that, yeah, yeah.  Well, it's one of those phrases you just have in the back of your head because no one really  listens, and you realize, oh my God, I was supposed to answer this person at this time  right here, and I have no clue what he's saying, and I don't want him mad at me. 
[02:00:30]  So you just, yeah, I heard about that.  Yeah.  Mine is also this one.  It's like, no, no, but the name sounds really familiar.  I did that moments ago at the commercial break.  Yeah, yeah, I know that person.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  Is he, yeah, he's skinny?  Fat?  Is he fat?  Yeah.  Fat skinny?  No, he's fat.  No, that's what I mean.  Yeah, he's skinny fat.  You know, skinny fat?  Like a human thing.  Yeah, real short, short hair, long hair, kind of a ponytail. 
[02:01:00]  Breathes air.  Yeah.  So the Celtics, nothing?  Yeah, I don't know a lot of details about it.  But how great is it to see Kobe get smashed like that?  That's great.  It was his time to step up, and he loses the championship by, what, a mere 39 points last  night.  Not even close for Kobe and the gang.  Yeah.  I did not watch the game.  No?  There you go.  Just be honest.  I don't know.  I decided.  I know nothing about it.  I learned a lesson from that last conversation.  You learned something from five minutes ago.  I'm like, I did not watch the show. 
[02:01:30]  I did not watch the game.  You could have, like, faked it, though.  Who are these little angels?  I would get annoyed when people go to the games and shout instructions at the players.  Those little players are going to be like, yeah, I play basketball 95 hours a week, but  maybe that fat guy with a hot dog knows what he's talking about.  Hey, we got to go to Brian in Tennessee.  Brian, what's up?  Yeah.  Doesn't Mike owe Kenny a bare-bottom spanking from the last time he was on the show, and 
[02:02:00]  Kenny screwed up his order?  Wait, Mike Birbiglia owes Club Soda Kenny a bare-bottom spanking?  Do you remember this?  Anyone?  Wow.  No.  Anyone?  Kenny, did Kenny screw up your order last time you were in?  I think he's talking about another comedian named Mike Terbiglia.  Oh, he's the other one, yeah.  People get you guys confused.  Oh, Travis might have knowledge on this.  Travis?  Yeah, I think it was when we called Kenny.  Mm-hmm.  He had already left, and he asked if he could be spanked tomorrow.  I think that, I'm not positive, but I think this caller... 
[02:02:30]  What had he screwed up?  I think he...  I think Mike had originally not wanted food, and then he changed his mind, and Kenny didn't  get him the food.  Kenny the slacker just went home.  I'm not sure.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  Just took the money and ran, as he always does.  Yeah, where's Club Soda Kenny?  Is that how you remember it, Brian?  That's exactly how I remember it.  He called in, and he said that he was going to come back the next day, because he was busy  and couldn't come back right then.  Sure.  Not too busy to deposit the check, though, but too busy to do the job. 
[02:03:00]  Where's Kenny?  Is he slacking somewhere?  Yeah, he's not even here, right?  He's playing napping.  Where's Kenny?  I don't know.  No one knows where Kenny is.  Where did he go?  Where is he?  He's usually right there.  Besides not making someone feel good, what is he doing?  Mike, you hang in there.  We're going to get you your bare-bottom spanking, all right?  Oh, I'm sure he's really just eagerly awaiting that whole thing.  So nothing on the Celtics.  Jimmy, we were talking about at the break about how Opie came to my show, comes backstage, 
[02:03:30]  we're hanging out.  We're like, hey, we live in the same neighborhood.  We should get lunch sometime.  A couple weeks later, I text message him, hey, you want to get lunch?  Never writes back.  All right.  I just had that awful, in show business, you know, you always have that thing where  you're like, you know, that was a nice conversation, maybe we'll get together again, and then  you're like, oh no, he hated me, and he was just like humoring me the whole time. 
[02:04:00]  When he walked in, when Mike walked in, I realized I'd never answered his text message,  and then I had to explain, I was hanging out at Niagara Falls in Western New York for  the long weekend, because we did have kind of a connection after the Caroline show, and  we're like, yeah, we should, you know, your girl seems nice, my girl's nice, and I think  we might get something going here.  Even Jenny said, she goes, yeah, you introduced me to a lot of your friends, and I usually  hate them, and I really like that guy.  Oh, that's a backhanded compliment.  All right, look at that.  We will do lunch. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, we'll have lunch.  Soon.  I'm addicted to my phone, I realize, because I feel like there's some part of my brain  that thinks that there's going to be a phone call from someone telling me that they spoke  to everyone from my high school, and they decided I was cool after all.  Or like, it's going to be someone from Hollywood being like, we decided to let you in.  Isn't it great when people from high school are like, yeah, man, we're so happy when you  see the people that were always not nice to you back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, that's why Boston's fun to go back to. 
[02:05:00]  But he's onto something, because I got the BlackBerry, and I'll take a nap, and as soon  as I wake up, I've got to check my email, because I'm just convinced today's the day  that XM decided to give me a $10 million raise.  Really?  Just some ridiculous email is going to come in today, and it never comes in.  It's hard not to check.  With the immediacy of information now, it's hard to not just like, that's the type of thing  like 10 years ago you would have just thought.  Yeah.  But now it's like, I can actually check.  Like, so it's kind of hard not to. 
[02:05:30]  And I always have these grand ambitions for the next time I'm going to go online.  I'm like, next time I go on the internet, I'm going to look up healthy recipes and gyms  in my neighborhood.  Then I go online, I'm like, why don't I Google myself again?  Yeah.  I don't even Google myself anymore.  I actually get Google alerts.  You get that?  Yeah, yeah.  Google alerts.  They email you when you've been mentioned on a blog or a website.  And last year, someone came to one of my shows and they said that they enjoyed it, but that  I was pudgy and awkward.  Right.  And I was like, thanks for the heads up, Google. 
[02:06:00]  Wasn't feeling great about myself to begin with.  Thank God Google doesn't have the technology to find out how many times Opie from the Opie  and Anthony show has Googled Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Would be embarrassing.  George Bush knows, man.  Really?  I was trying to make a joke.  I was trying to relate to our comedian friend here.  My favorite is like when Opie Johnson is running against Anthony Smith in some local  election in Arkansas. 
[02:06:30]  In the Red Ribbon Marathon.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'll get the Google alert and be like, oh, what's this Opie and Anthony thing?  You get all cocky and there's people around like, well, excuse me, another Google alert  coming in for myself.  We're in the news.  Those newsmakers.  Oh, right.  It's Ben Opie, whoever the hell that guy is.  It's the kid that used to play Opie on Mayberry.  Yeah, wonderful.  Do you know how annoying it is?  There are other Jim Nortons.  Does Jim Norton like some comptroller?  There's a sheriff. 
[02:07:00]  Comptroller.  A sheriff, Jim Norton.  Really?  There's an actor, Jim Norton.  You sound a lot taller on the radio.  There was a Jim Norton that just won a Tony Award.  Congratulations to our own Jim Norton for winning a Tony.  I'm guessing it's the guy on Broadway now because every time I see Jim Norton, I check  news because I see if there's anything been recently printed about you.  It's never me.  Yeah.  I come up first, I think, for Jim Norton.  I wonder who's done more perverse stuff sexually.  You were the Tony Award winner.  I was the Tony Award winner.  You never know. 
[02:07:30]  You never know.  A sheriff, he's got a handcuff and a gun.  That's Jim Norton?  That's Jim Norton who won the Tony.  Jim?  Wow.  He's old.  Norm, where'd you grow up?  North Carolina, Central Jersey.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin?  Hi, guys.  Hi, Emma.  Hey, Kev.  Welcome aboard.  How are you?  Board.  I saw the Celtics cut their trophy last night.  How come they didn't get a white baby?  Yeah, Anthony came up with something yesterday.  We noticed when Tiger Woods won the U.S. Open.  They handed him a white baby and the trophy. 
[02:08:00]  They handed him a white baby and a trophy.  So, I don't know.  We thought that was the new trend in sports.  A coveted white baby.  You get the blonde wife and the white baby and the trophy.  No white babies for the Celtics.  It was just the context, like how they handed him the prizes.  Yeah.  It was, you know, obviously it's his kid, but when a woman walks over right after you win,  hands you a white baby, walks away, and then they hand you the cup.  It's just like, wow, this is a hell of a prize.  There you go.  You can trade in that model and take the good one. 
[02:08:30]  You can actually trade that in for three black babies.  Yes.  What's the exchange rate?  Club Soda Kenny, do you remember screwing up Mike Birbiglia's order last time he was in?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Do you remember?  And then we wanted you to drive back to the station and you said, ah, can you just spank  me tomorrow?  All right.  All right.  I don't know if that happens.  Is it time?  Yeah, it's time.  So why don't you get near Mike?  Mike, this is what happens when Club Soda Kenny wrecks orders around here.  He does it on purpose. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You have to give him a bear bomb spanking.  I'm sorry.  No, that's not what.  No, you really don't.  I read the rules.  I don't think.  Look, he put his firearm down.  Look, his pants are dropped.  He's got his big boy underpants on.  I'm going to spank him with my Starbucks fruit and cheese plate, if that's all right.  Oh, it's got to be bear bottom.  You won't let you spank his bear ass.  But you spank his ass.  Yeah, you got it.  Wait, get the mic over there, Mike.  You know.  All right.  And you got to call him names like bad boy and stuff.  Do you want me to really hit him? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  No, you don't.  Yes, we do.  Kenny?  He's got to be really hit.  Spanking is a spanking.  Spanking is a spanking.  He's been bad.  Mike.  Yeah, I can tell him.  Is that all right?  He doesn't even feel it.  I want to make it equal.  One on the other cheek.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got it.  All right.  That was a good one.  All right.  Hold on.  One more.  I made a thud.  Hold on.  I got to take a picture of this.  Just punch him.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Punch him dead center.  Pull a Caligula. 
[02:10:00]  That was a good one.  Oh, God.  He's like punching him.  I'm practicing my spank.  I don't really.  That's good.  I don't have a lot of practice.  Kenny just is impervious.  Oh.  All right.  That was a good one.  Wow.  This kid has played some racquetball.  That was a good one.  That was a racquetball swing.  Right into the corner.  Kenny.  That one had a hurt, Kenny.  Are you satisfied?  Satisfied.  Sexually, but not, you know.  Kenny taunts you into spanking him harder. 
[02:10:30]  No kidding.  That's a little creepy, Kenny.  He likes it.  He does like it.  He actually says, bet you can't make me say ow.  Well, I bet you can't make me.  With that, we've got to wrap up.  Brilliant.  That's brilliant.  In a half hour, we've got Dana White calling in, too, ahead of the UFC.  Oh.  Yeah, I was reading a really good article on him in Rolling Stone magazine.  Oh, really?  I came from nowhere to run UFC.  Old girly name is calling up? 
[02:11:00]  What?  Old girly name is going to call?  That was Anthony Cumia.  What?  Phone call, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, girly name?  Do we have the Rolling Stone article?  I don't know.  I love how I just had to spank Andre the Giant's ass on something I don't even remember.  He wears kind of like the old school wrestling shorts, too, so.  Hey, I've got to say hi to a George Skilling.  He's from SEAL Team 3 Echo.  Look what he gave me.  I've got a Navy SEAL, one of the coins.  Hey, that's really cool. 
[02:11:30]  I know.  Feeling good.  Thank you, Command Master Chief George Skilling from SEAL Team 3 Echo.  And I want to remind people on this side of the show on Friday, Mike Myers is stopping by.  This is a huge get for the boys because he doesn't do radio.  That's cool.  And we appreciate the fact that Mike is going to be doing some time with us.  Is it the Austin Powers guy or the scary guy from Halloween?  Which one?  Austin Powers.  That would be funny to get both of them in at the same time.  Why not?  And then pay more attention to the other one.  So the guy in the mask. 
[02:12:00]  And he doesn't talk.  That's a Leslie Nielsen.  Of course it is.  And then we go to Mike.  Be patient.  We'll get to you eventually.  Funny you should mention him.  I just got a picture with him last week.  Tony Moran.  Really?  The other Mike Myers?  The original Mike Myers.  Okay.  There's something else.  Is that really funny, Jim?  No, let me rephrase that.  Not even interesting that you mention that.  But incidentally, and I feel like saying it.  You're a good point.  I did classify that as hilarious. 
[02:12:30]  Pull over, folks.  Jim coming.  I fire that dull information at you.  Reverend Al from North Carolina.  Punch him in the fart box.  We love that new term.  All right.  Mike Birbiglia.  Always a pleasure.  Summer stays.  Central Park.  Friday with Stephen Lynch.  Here we go. 
[02:13:00]  What do we got?  We got a pair to broadcast.  Broadcast radio about to happen.  We are now broadcasting live from the XM Studios here in midtown Manhattan.  In living color.  As we look out the window, we see the Hindenburg headed toward Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Oh, my God.  It crashed.  Mike.  Nice professional broadcaster there. 
[02:13:30]  Mike Birbiglia in studio.  Hello.  To continue the fine radio show.  Hijinks.  Hey, where's the Joan Rivers thing?  We got to play the dirty version.  Uncensored.  Uncensored dirty version.  Do we have that?  Yeah.  I don't really know.  I know.  I don't really.  You know, if she gets one more facelift, she's going to have a goatee.  Oh, good gosh.  Good gravy.  Never heard that one.  I hear we have an adult film star on the bleachers. 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  Jimmy D-Rock.  Do you recognize her?  No.  I know who she is, but I have not seen her film.  My friend Chris knows her well.  I've met her before.  She's right now.  A couple of the interns were like, well, who do we got here?  Yeah.  Apparently, she's very well known.  Yeah.  But I guess I've only watched porn from Evil Angel because my friend, Yoshi, sent it to  me for several years.  Some kind of fucking loyalty?  It's called brand loyalty, my friend.  Is it? 
[02:14:30]  Yes, it is.  Brand loyalty.  It sure is.  Who doesn't want a good strap attack?  But then again, maybe she's...  Strap attack.  I'm just saying.  My friend makes that.  Club Soda Kenny is tapping on the microphone, so I think that means he wants to say something.  I would like to interject.  Yes, Kenny.  Can I guess which person it is?  Yes, you can.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  The brother, of course.  He's got all the right equipment.  I've recognized him before, and I don't think it was a mugshot. 
[02:15:00]  Jeez.  What do you remember?  Dumping him off out of your patrol car one day?  Yeah.  Tuning him up.  In a bad neighborhood?  Kenny, he must have been something as a cop, man.  Sure.  Back in the old days, before video got everyone in trouble.  I was...  We could pummel people.  I was so afraid a few minutes ago when we were...  When you guys had me spank Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, first of all, it wasn't based on anything that I remembered happening. 
[02:15:30]  You guys were like, you gotta spank Kenny, because last time he didn't get you breakfast.  I'm like, I don't remember that at all.  You just got pushed into something I don't think you wanted to do.  And then I gotta spank Kenny, and he's a big, big man.  Yeah.  And I'm like, who's to say that Kenny's not gonna get a little angry, smash my head on  the table, and then I'm dead.  Yeah.  And then people are like, oh, those Opie and Anthony guys, those guys are crazy.  Yeah.  Mike the Biggley went in there, spanked this guy, then they killed him.  One of their goons killed him. 
[02:16:00]  You gotta...  Then they yank you off satellite.  Right.  You gotta work on your trust, I'm thinking.  You were...  You're way too trustworthy.  You just assumed everything was gonna be okay.  We could have set you up for a disaster.  Smack this pit bull in the face.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Steal his food.  And then the pit bull rips your face off.  Oh, wow.  We didn't think it was gonna do that.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yes, Kenny?  Because killing for me is like breathing for other people.  Exactly.  I can only imagine. 
[02:16:30]  Kenny, what do you miss the most about being a police officer?  Back in the good old days.  You know.  Back in the good old days.  And let's preface this by saying, Kenny, this is radio.  You're just...  You're exaggerating.  I loved being a public servant to protect and serve and help people.  What state were you a cop in?  In Jersey.  I got arrested by a Jersey cop once.  Did you?  For what?  What'd you do?  Suspended license.  Oh, no.  I was coming back from Rascals Comedy Club. 
[02:17:00]  I don't even know if Rascals still exists.  We remember the Rascals.  I was starting out, I was emceeing, making $50 for the show, spending $75 in gas and tolls,  driving back in a borrowed car, my buddy's car.  And I was...  You know that speed trap going into the Lincoln Tunnel?  No.  I'm going to say no.  I have a new strategy.  No, I don't.  I've been through the Lincoln Tunnel many times, but I don't notice a speed trap.  All right.  I'm being honest.  You go down a hill from Jersey around a corner into the Lincoln Tunnel. 
[02:17:30]  The heel is.  That I know.  Yes.  And they have a speed trap there.  There's a lot of cops set up.  Do they really?  Yeah.  And I got pulled over, and I knew when I got pulled over that my license was expired.  And so I was like, oh, that could be problematic.  And so I take out my license.  The guy goes, comes back to the car, and he goes, do you know that your license is suspended?  But I didn't know what suspended meant. 
[02:18:00]  And so I go, yeah, no, I don't know what's suspended.  That's what I said.  And then he goes, could you please step out of the car?  Oh, no.  Puts me on the car, cuffs me, puts me in the back of the cruiser.  And I got arrested.  They took me, and I had to take out my shoelaces.  Wow, that bad.  In case you hung yourself, yeah.  Yeah, hung myself from a suspended license.  Did they photo and fingerprint?  Yeah, they took my photo, and actually the guy took an extra one for himself. 
[02:18:30]  He goes, this is in case you ever get famous.  And then he puts it in his pocket.  Little did he know.  Yeah.  What a guy.  That I would not be really famous.  But I would be at Summer Stage in Central Park.  It's Friday.  Yeah.  With the great Stephen Lynch.  You're like leaving something out of the story, I'm thinking.  Like a kilo of coke or something.  No, I'm.  Because it seems like you were treated a little harshly. 
[02:19:00]  Well, guys like.  Considering it was a suspended license.  No, I think cops, when they have a bad dad, they're like, I'm going to arrest a motherfucker.  For a suspended license.  A suspended license.  I stood by the side of the car like a fool.  I wanted my license back.  This I cannot do.  Can I change gears for a second?  Because there's a juxtaposition type of thing going on here with Danny's grandfather and Tim Russert. 
[02:19:30]  Really?  When did Tim Russert die?  Oh, right.  Saturday.  Yeah.  Or Friday.  Yes.  Friday or so?  Friday or Saturday.  We're five days in and they're still remembering Tim Russert on every single news program.  Yeah.  Especially MSNBC.  I think it's day four of The Wake, I think.  And how long was it from death to being buried for your grandfather?  My grandfather passed away Sunday morning and he was in the ground by Sunday, by Monday afternoon. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  And this Tim Russert, he's still laying and.  He's on display somewhere.  Yeah, he's on display.  All I could think about was save me.  That's all I thought about yesterday.  Oh, fuck.  He's on the I'm Dying World Tour.  Yeah.  He's just, he's dead and they're taking him around, they're carting him around.  Mike, what is that?  You missed a great one yesterday.  Danny was explaining how his grandfather was in the hospital and because of lung cancer 
[02:20:30]  he really couldn't communicate, but he could still write.  Yeah.  No, he couldn't write.  Not write.  They put the alphabet in front of him.  Sure.  Right.  They drew out the alphabet.  Like Diving Bell and the Butterfly.  He pointed to the letters like a Ouija board.  Oh, boy.  Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a French film from last year.  One Best Picture.  Oh, I heard about that one.  No, I didn't.  I saw it.  I have no idea which one that is.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm at the wrong radio show.  I'm meant to be at NPR.  I'm meant to be on Fresh Air.  Exactly.  Bob Edwards probably saw it four times.  On the inside of his coffin. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, it's like a Ouija board type thing.  Yeah, yeah, I get it.  They held up the letters.  R, S, T, and then he blinks and that kind of thing.  And he pointed to spell out Save Me.  Oh.  How fucking awful.  I thought of that last night.  I'm just staring at the ceiling and I had to put like Seinfeld on.  I had to put something funny on.  Mine would be kill instead of save.  Just kill.  If that were me.  No, I would go save me.  Pull out all the stops.  Save me. 
[02:21:30]  Maybe he was a really big Amy Mann fan and he was making a request.  Somebody on the feedback yesterday commented maybe he was just itchy and spelled it wrong  and he meant to say shave me.  Shave me.  You know, you got to hope it was something other than I'm dying and don't want to even  at this age.  Because you'd hope once you reach that age and you're in such ill health that you just  kind of do accept the fact and go, look, maybe there's something else after this.  I'm not really enjoying myself on this planet anymore on this plane of existence and I'll  just ease on to the next level, whatever it is, even if it's nothing. 
[02:22:00]  But then he's just like, my God, I want to live more.  I just want to live.  Save me.  I think you get it in your head that it's okay to die, but while you're still healthy  and then once you're laying in that bed with all the tubes and you're just like, fuck,  this is going to happen now.  I think that's when you start to say, you know, maybe I'm not cool with death anymore.  I've accepted.  Yeah, in the movies, they're always like, it's like, what was it?  Arthur.  Where fucking Arthur comes into, what's his name's room there? 
[02:22:30]  John Gilgut Hobson.  John Gilgut Hobson's room and Hobson, you know, he brings him all the toys and Hobson  goes, I'm scared, Arthur.  And he goes, oh, it's okay.  And they work it out.  And then later on in the movie, a few minutes later, actually, he's like, ah, you know,  it's not so bad, Arthur.  Dying.  It's not so bad.  And everything was fine.  Thank you.  Thank you for the musical interlude.  And then Liza Minnelli comes in with a fucking insect face.  And a horrible fucking George Clooney haircut.  Her shitty fucking, her white face cuckold of a husband. 
[02:23:00]  I always, I get David Guest.  I always, flat, awful Joan Rivers face.  Beat it, sissy.  She scrapped it on and you took it.  You marry.  You fucking marry him.  I always, I always find at the funerals that the, the, the sympathy cards are so underwhelming  as a gesture.  Yeah.  He's saying, I know you're going through the deepest loneliness of your entire life.  So here's a picture of a daffodil.  What's that work out for you?  I've always wanted to make my own sympathy card.  Like in the cover, I'd put a picture of like a duck-billed platypus playing checkers 
[02:23:30]  with a rhinoceros.  In the background, there's like a hot dog with arms holding up a lemonade stand at gunpoint.  And then you open it up and it's like, the world is fucked up, man.  Sorry about your brother.  Or whatever specific information.  Well, it's an untimely death.  You show a big cock inside a big vagina.  And when you open it up, it says, looks like God fucked him.  Just like this.  Get it?  There's a big dick.  Get it.  Once in your life.  A little Arthur music.  Yeah, and then, then Hobson drops dead. 
[02:24:00]  And that was, uh.  And he was fine with it.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  Where saved me for him?  Well, you should have seen him in Caligula dying.  It wasn't quite as pleasant.  No.  When Mal, he, he opened it, he fucking cut his wrist.  And Peter O'Toole's like, bind his wrist.  And fucking Malcolm McDowell puts his, because he's in a hot tub, he puts his like mouth by  his ear.  Can you see ISIS?  And he goes, no.  And he just shoves his head under the water.  Oh, fuck.  Do you see how you're lying?  He knew he was lying.  He just fucking drowned him. 
[02:24:30]  They show him.  He's just in a big glass tub with his fucking wrist bleeding in Caligula.  Nice.  A few years ago, my, uh, my grandmother passed away and I was in, I was in, uh, Florida,  West Palm at that improv.  Yeah.  And, uh, I went to see the movie Million Dollar Baby.  Oh, yeah.  It was up at the time.  Oh, yeah.  And it's, and it was like about pulling, they pulled a plug in the thing and, and somebody,  they literally pulled a plug on my grandmother like that day.  And so I'm in the movie and I'm watching that alone in the, in the West Palm. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, no.  And I'm just crying, just full on, alone and crying.  I, and I never get recognized, you know, I'll probably do.  I, I walk out of the theater and some guy goes, hey, that's Mike Birbiglia.  And I just walked away.  I didn't even acknowledge it.  Mike Birbiglia.  So someone somewhere is like, yeah, I saw Mike Birbiglia and he was just crying in the street.  Hey, hey, hey, Mike, what, were you crying?  What?  Crying at that movie?  What the fuck, dude?  Uh, we, we got to communicate here. 
[02:25:30]  We did some more research on the Club Soda Kenny bare-bottom spanking that went down about  an hour ago, less than an hour ago.  The bare-bottom spanking was actually meant for Dan Natterman.  So, Mike, I apologize.  Oh, no.  I knew, I kept pointing out that it was for someone else.  You're ripping, you know, poor Dan Natterman, you know, you took his bare-bottom spanking.  A bare-bottom spanking, uh, certainly, uh, certainly, sir.  I'll be glad to give you one.  Yeah, uh, Dan Natterman was supposed to, uh, bare-bottom spanking. 
[02:26:00]  I've been doing comedy for some 35 years and now I'm doing a bare-bottom spanking.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  We love, uh, Dan Natterman.  Natterman's great.  Our stupid fans decide not to give him a real chance at our animation festival.  It's too bad.  You know what's funny about Natterman is, did you see him on Last Comic Standing?  Not yet.  He was on, like, the first episode and, did you see this, Jim?  I just watched one episode.  He goes on and does his thing. 
[02:26:30]  He comes off and whoever the judge was goes, uh, that's a good character.  Oh, no.  Like, no, no, that's not a character.  Oh, no.  That's what he's like 24 hours a day.  What fucking judge said that?  I don't even know who it was.  I think it was actually the fellow from Law and Order with the sunglasses.  I don't know.  No.  That was me.  But it does figure he is.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, the comedian from the 70s.  Oh, Belzer.  Yeah, Belzer.  I like Richard, but.  Belzer.  What a doucey term that is.  Good character. 
[02:27:00]  Want to hear Joan Rivers, Uncensored?  You bet I do.  I love it.  All right.  We played this a little earlier.  We found out there's an English version of The View.  It's called Loose Women.  Loose Women, right.  I thought it was cunts across the pond.  Because they get loose with their talk, I guess.  Is it?  Or is it the fact that their plots are all stretched out?  You'd like to think.  Not from Limey Cock.  Yeah, a bunch of pony mouths just dangling into fucking awful panties.  Pony mouths.  Don't even shave their pussies.  Yuck. 
[02:27:30]  This is Joan Rivers cursing.  Is that a part of your life that you enjoy doing that kind of meeting and greeting the  celebrities on the red carpet?  When they're nice.  Yeah.  And we know what we're saying.  Yeah.  You get someone like Russell Crowe and you want to say to the camera, he is a piece of  get ready to bleak this fucking shit.  He is just.  Oh.  We mustn't.  No, no, no.  We mustn't get ready to bleak.  We haven't got a bleak.  We haven't got a bleak.  And we do apologize. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sorry about that.  We do apologize.  That Joan wasn't aware that we were absolutely live.  And we do apologize.  And we better end allegedly.  Well done.  Because he's going to see.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Not to mention the mother that's saying to her four-year-old now.  Now these words are.  These words are words that mommy now has to wear a big vest.  Now listen.  The reason. 
[02:28:30]  Joan Rivers is at the age.  It just doesn't matter.  She doesn't give a fuck.  She's going to go on live TV and curse every time now.  But look how it is in England.  They're all laughing and joking about it.  I'm just going with it.  When, if that happened here.  Oh God, go to a commercial.  They'd be dead silence.  They'd go to a commercial.  They'd clear the set.  They'd put on somber music.  Dim the lights.  And someone would go on with some fucking inane apology.  Yeah.  For five minutes.  People get.  There was a word that was uttered.  That can destroy the earth.  If uttered more than once. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  And we apologize.  People get obsessed with the word fucking.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  And it's insane.  Because it doesn't even mean anything.  It's like going.  I don't want you using adverbs that acknowledge that sex exists.  And it's not even like you're affirming that you support casual sex.  You could be like, I am fucking abstinent.  People would be like, yeah, he's probably abstinent.  I buy that.  He used emphasis.  Yeah.  Kenny.  That's annoying.  We owe you an apology. 
[02:29:30]  You got a bare bottom spanking today for no reason whatsoever.  I don't mind.  Well, fortunately, Dan Ederman is never going to be booked on the show again.  So you needed to get it anyway.  I will have Dan back.  And Kenny, it's also probably a lot similar to what you used to do when you were a cop.  He was probably guilty of something anyway.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So you deserved it.  Who am I to complain?  Kenny.  Can I have another?  No. 
[02:30:00]  No.  Another.  Now it's creepy.  There was a guy on the line, but he hung up.  Good for him.  He said he bought the car that you shot up when you were a police officer.  Is there any story there that you'd like to share?  Wow.  Which one?  Which one?  This guy swears he bought a car that you shot up.  I guess it was a big get.  Maybe that guy could call back.  Did he put a couple of holes in a vehicle there, Kenny?  Oh, back in the day, you were allowed to let some lead fly. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, those were the days.  The days where you didn't have to count your bullets, right?  Modern technology ruined everything.  Oh, totally.  You know.  If they had cameras in the cars when I was in a radio car, I'd be in the penitentiary now.  This is like what people from the Third Reich, this is how they tell stories.  It's like, oh, back in the day, we could really, you know.  It was wonderful.  We could rape people and their daughters and their fathers at the same time, and it was 
[02:31:00]  fantastic.  Nobody said anything.  No trouble.  Now with the internet, you know, you can't do any of that.  Yeah.  And the cameras in the cars, right, Kenny?  Yeah, yeah.  Video cameras ruined policing.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Saw a guy yesterday, that guy that had a police chase, and he wound up clipping an SUV, and  the SUV flipped over and slid on its roof, and then the guy gets out of the car, starts  running, an officer got him, and then they put the camera on him for a couple of seconds, 
[02:31:30]  and he was getting a little how-do-you-do from the officer.  Yeah, see, before the camera, everything was an accident.  Was that it?  Yeah.  He trapped.  Yeah.  It was an accident.  Fell down the stairs.  It was an accident.  Yeah.  Fell down the stairs.  How bad would it be to accidentally fall down the stairs during an arrest?  Because you know, it was pick you up by the collar and the seat of your pants, and you  were flying down the stairs. 
[02:32:00]  You know what was a good alibi?  Hypothetically speaking, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  If you got in a car chase, and the shittims crashed, you know?  Well, anything that happened to him happened during the crash.  Oh, so, you know, if his teeth got knocked out, it hit the steering wheel.  Before airbags.  Yeah.  No airbags.  He should have worn a seatbelt.  We got the guy that has the car.  Steve, Jersey. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, you got it a little bit wrong.  I impounded one of the cars that Kenny had some fun with.  It was down on Park Ave at that Sunoco station, and these guys tried to run him over, and  Kenny probably let about six or seven bullets into the car.  I might add, I only took two shots, but I swear to God, and I was the only one justified.  Everybody else that shot, it was kind of questionable.  Oh!  Oh, my God!  You only took two shots. 
[02:33:00]  Two out of the six that made the car?  I don't know.  That was like another Sean Belt thing, where everybody just surrounded the car and was  like shooting.  Oh, God!  As the car pulled away, thank God the statute of limitations is up.  Sure.  As the car pulled away, one guy actually got down on one knee and was shooting at the  car when it was like 200 yards down the street.  Oh, and that's a no-no.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But now he was trying to run you over?  Excuse me, sir?  The car looked like Swiss cheese after they finished with it. 
[02:33:30]  So, Kenny, the guy was trying to run you over?  No, what happened was it was a drug deal that had gone bad.  Of course.  We had this female informant, you know, and she says, this guy, you know, she can call  him, you know, have him deliver something, and he always carries a gun.  And we're like, okay.  Oh, boy.  So, we set it up that we were going to meet him at this pay phone at a gas station, right?  All right.  And we told her, whatever you do, don't get in the car.  We must have told her a thousand times, don't get in the car. 
[02:34:00]  Whatever you do, don't get in the car.  So, me and my partner was at the gas pumps pretending like we were getting gas.  Uh-huh.  Another car was parked across the street in this parking lot, and a third car was on  a side street parked, all right?  And when the shittums pulled up, all right, what is the first thing she did?  She got in the car, like we told her a thousand times.  Stupid.  Not to do, all right?  So, when, you know, so when that happened, and then they were going to pull away, we went  to surround them, all right? 
[02:34:30]  You know, the shittums have all the luck.  He squeaked.  The shittums.  Who are the shittums?  I don't even follow this.  They're the bad guys.  All right.  Yeah.  The shittums.  All right.  Why shittums?  Ah, that's like an endearing term.  I feel like you're the shittums in the story.  That's how I feel it.  Oh, Kenny rules in this.  Yeah.  Kenny's the hero.  Kenny, hurry up, because we got Dana White on the phone here.  I got to hear this.  No, so anyway, we tried to block him in. 
[02:35:00]  He squeaked out by a cunt hair.  I don't know how he missed the gas pumps, all right?  Wow.  And then, you know, they had two guns.  They had a .45 and a .38.  We had our shit, and you know.  You started shooting into the car with the informant in it?  Well, that was the whole thing.  Oh, Jesus.  Here's the thing about it.  When Kenny tells stories like this, he really lights up. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it makes me think that the rest of the time, he's pretending to be retarded.  I'm like, no, no, no.  Kenny's really smart and with it.  He's very smart when it comes to being a police officer.  He's an idiot savant with police work.  Anything else, he's retarded.  But police work was always.  It makes him happy to talk about the old days.  Look at his smile.  Did any of the guys get hit in the car?  Well, they took off.  Right.  Right.  And then, like, so we had to chase them, run them off the road.  And then, you know, there's like a dozen cars.  Yeah, yeah.  And so everybody gets ripped out of the car and gets beaten, you know. 
[02:36:00]  So one of the guys grabbed the informant and was, like, whipping her ass.  So, like, I had to, you know, like, grab her away from him and, you know.  And take care of that.  All that ends well.  And for some reason, I was spanking you earlier today.  We got to go.  We can definitely come back to this.  I want to talk more.  Kenny, hold on a second.  We got Dana White.  Let's say hi to Dana White, the owner of the UFC.  How are you, Dana?  Good morning. 
[02:36:30]  I hear you only have five minutes.  What's that about?  I'll stay on as long as you want me to.  All right.  I like that.  That's it.  So, yeah, we've been meaning to talk to you because we've had a lot of the guys in.  And we had Randy in.  And we had Tito Ortiz in.  And you definitely had some really rough things to say.  My boys.  Yeah.  At one point, right?  What happened with these guys?  I haven't heard you badmouth, Randy.  But what happened especially with Tito?  Tito's an idiot.  You know, Tito's one of these guys.  Tito's all about himself. 
[02:37:00]  And, you know, Tito wants to walk around and cry about this and that.  When Tito refused to fight Chuck Liddell a couple years ago, refused to fight him.  Had the belt.  Wouldn't fight Chuck Liddell, who was the number one contender.  And, you know, so basically ended up sitting out.  Sat out for almost a year and a half.  And then was crying.  You know, he drove his car into a tree.  His life was in the hole and all this stuff.  I brought Tito back.  Brought him back into the UFC.  And the year that he was with us, that he came back, he made six point something million dollars. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  You know?  Tito's just, Tito's an idiot.  And when Tito was good, I had to put up with his shit.  And now that he sucks, I don't have to put up with him.  Wow.  Wow.  Now, is this before, because Tito couldn't beat Liddell.  What, did Chuck beat him twice, right?  Or was it three times?  Was this before they had ever fought?  Like, this was, and Tito?  Yeah, it was before they ever fought.  Tito absolutely refused to fight him.  The thing is with Tito, the big problem with Tito is, he's the guy that I put out front  when we first bought this company.  You know, and there was a lot of smoke and mirrors built around Tito. 
[02:38:00]  The reality is, Tito was never really a guy who really wanted to be a fighter.  He's somebody that, you know, I think he wanted to use fighting as a vehicle to become famous  and do movies and things like that.  And his heart's never been in fighting.  You said, you, uh...  See, Randy Couture is a whole other ballgame.  I have nothing but respect for Randy Couture.  This guy is a real fighter.  He's always fought the best fighters in the world.  And, you know, Randy and I, you know, whatever his reasoning is for wanting to sit out now 
[02:38:30]  and do his thing, I want Randy Couture back in the UFC.  And, uh, you know, I want him to be a part of this thing until it's, uh, you know, for  the rest of his life.  So, I'm trying to work that out with Randy right now and we'll see what happens.  Dana, a lot of the guys are basically saying they feel like they should be making more  money from, uh, from, uh, the UFC.  Yeah.  It seems like, you know, the sport is blowing up.  Uh, where are we at with that?  Well, it's, you know, it's human nature. 
[02:39:00]  It's always going to be an issue.  So, you know, no matter what the guys make, every, you want to make more money, your producer  wants to make more money.  Everybody always wants to make more money.  Yes, but I know I'm not worth it.  I'm in the, uh, I'm in the contract business.  Every time, uh, you know, whether it has a six or eight fight deal is, is contracts up  and we're, we're back talking money again, you know?  So my, my big thing is money, money is one of those things that can be handled behind  the scenes.  And, and, uh, you know, I take a lot of heat because I don't talk about the money and 
[02:39:30]  I don't talk about how much they make.  I don't talk about how much we make, you know, but at the end of the day, I think that's  one of the big problems with a lot of major sports.  You got these people who make, you know, 25, 30, uh, thousand dollars a year buying tickets  for this stuff.  And, and you hear these athletes fucking crying about money.  You know, you just go, Oh, it only made 25 million last year, you know, uh, Dino Ortiz  came back out of, uh, you know, he was fucking flat broke at nothing, came back and made like 
[02:40:00]  6.3 million in 2006.  Yeah.  I fucking feel sorry for Tito.  Oh man.  Dana White's the real deal.  Well, Dana, I know Randy wanted to fight, uh, Fedor.  And, uh, was there any way for you guys to make that happen or will you not do it?  Or does he have to leave the USC to make that happen?  You know, I was dealing with, uh, with those, uh, his managers, man, and, uh, trying to  get the deal done.  The problem is, you know, Fedor's from Russia, you know, and his manager, every time you talk  to his managers, it's all about what we can do for his manager. 
[02:40:30]  It's not about Fedor.  Right.  So it, you know, it was, it was a tricky negotiation.  See, here's the thing.  The buck always stops here with me.  You know what I mean?  At the end of the day, Dana couldn't get this.  Dana couldn't do that.  You know, I'm dealing with a lot of crazy fuckers.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm dealing with this crazy Russian dude from, from Russia who was asking me to build  a stadium in Russia and he'll be my partner and all this other stuff.  And I'm, all I want to do is sign Fedor to fight, you know?  So it's always easy to look at me and say, oh, Dana couldn't get that done. 
[02:41:00]  But there's a lot of different personalities I deal with.  I have a hundred employees who work for me and I got 250 fighters under contract.  I'm never going to be the guy that's going to keep everybody happy.  And Dana, you came out of nowhere to take over the UFC and make it what it is today.  I was reading about you last night and you used to live in Southie and you, you ran a  gym or something.  And then, uh, uh, uh, Mr. Bolger's, uh, men came, came a call and saying, look, you're  doing business in my area and we need some money.  I think they wanted something like $3,500 a month or something from you. 
[02:41:30]  And you, you basically split Boston and, and went, uh, out to Vegas where you're from  originally, right?  Correct.  And then, yeah.  What can you, I've been in the boxing business for years since I was a kid.  I mean, I was, I was an amateur boxer and, and, and ran some gyms and ran a nonprofit gym  in, in, in, uh, Boston and then came out to Vegas.  And basically I hooked up with my partners and we were going to start a boxing promotion.  And at the time I was, uh, I was managing Tito and Chuck and I got into this negotiation 
[02:42:00]  with the old owner of the UFC.  And through that, I found out they were in trouble and basically going out of business.  And yeah, I, uh, I think this thing might be for sale a month later.  We own the company.  Yeah.  You bought it for $2 million, which is amazing.  Now I do want to go back to the Bolger thing, cause I was reading that in Rolling Stone  magazine.  And could you elaborate a little more than what was in the article?  Yeah.  We're about a minute left too.  What?  We're about a minute left also.  A minute left.  I'll stay, I'll stay on as long as they want me to.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  Uh, I, uh, I, I, I went out to, uh, you know, I was out in the background back then we were  running this nonprofit gym, but to make money, we used to bring in business guys to train  and, you know, we, we teach them out of box and they pay us like, like a personal trainer.  And, uh, one day I was teaching down at one of the health clubs down there and, and one  of the guys showed up and said, do you know who I am?  And I said, no, I don't know who you are.  And he told me who he was.  And I said, basically they, they wanted some money from me. 
[02:43:00]  I said, I don't understand.  Shake down.  Yeah.  You're doing business in our town.  You know, you're, you're going to have to pay us some money.  So I completely ignored it and pretended the conversation never happened.  And, uh, and then I got a phone call at my house one day and they said, you owe us, you  owe us this money and you owe us this money by, by Sunday.  Oof.  And I said, all right, Delta airlines, please.  What kind of money were they asking for? 
[02:43:30]  $3,500, which at the time to me was a lot of money.  Sure.  $35,000.  Yeah.  Hey Dana, uh, is there anybody in the UFC you think that honestly now can, can, can beat  Fedor?  Yeah.  Who do you think could match up against him?  It's so overhyped.  Listen, the guy hasn't fought anybody since 2005, you know, he's become this, uh, you  know, this, this urban legend almost.  He, the guy hasn't fought anybody since 2005.  He's fought, he's fought nothing but bumps.  And, uh, you know, you got guys out there like Anderson Silva who are cleaning out, uh, 
[02:44:00]  the middleweight division.  Chuck Liddell fought everybody on the planet, you know, uh, Couture.  Couture, who's fought everybody on the planet, all these guys who, who, who fight all the  time and fight nothing but the best.  Yeah.  Uh, Fedor's a farce.  Was Mirko, wow, I'm surprised that you say that because I, I know like when, when Crow  Cobb came over, um, you know, we, we would all saw him, I've seen him on YouTube and  fighting and you're like, this guy's just going to devastate anybody and he did not do  that well.  Yeah.  Um, were you surprised or, or did you kind of see that coming or was it a shock? 
[02:44:30]  I, you know, I, it's not that I saw it coming, but you know, it's, uh, it's a whole nother  world over here and everybody for years, people thought that Japan was the, uh, Ooh, you know,  Japan is the big, uh, that that's where all the big, bad, crazy fighters are.  No, the reality is they're all here.  And, uh, you know, everybody can talk about this guy's better than that guy.  This guy, the only way that you can find out really who is the baddest dude on the planet  is to fight him.  Yeah.  The guy's got to fight and Fedor hasn't fought anybody. 
[02:45:00]  Hmm.  Who do you, and you have Rampage, uh, fighting, uh, what is it?  Uh, where the hell is that?  Rampage is fighting, uh, July 5th.  Okay.  Fighting, uh, Forrest Griffin.  Oh, here it is right here at the top.  And it's live on pay-per-view.  And where is this fight?  It's in Vegas.  It's at the Mandalay Bay, July 5th.  Do you see him in Liddell?  Cause I mean, we, we, we love Chuck and, uh, he, he came back and he, he, he beat Randy  and, uh, he beat, uh, whoever else had beaten him.  He beat, I forget who it was that had beaten him.  Uh, who was the second one that he had, had to come back? 
[02:45:30]  Jeremy Horn.  Okay.  Jeremy Horn.  And the last one that he could not beat was, uh, was Rampage.  Do you see them fighting again if Rampage wins to defend again against Liddell?  Yeah.  I think, I think people want to see it.  I mean, Chuck's, uh, Chuck's got a fight in September.  He'd have to win that fight.  And then, yeah, we, we could definitely see the rematch.  I know Chuck wants that fight bad.  Yeah.  It's amazing that he won.  I mean, he lost, uh, two in a row and, and it looks like, all right, maybe he's kind of  winding down and then he comes back and he wins a fight that I, honestly, I did not expect  him to win.  I know. 
[02:46:00]  Well, the crazy thing, you know, the crazy thing about the fights too, when you look at  these fights, like Rampage Jackson, you guys know Shogun Hua.  We, we got Shogun over from Pride and everybody, everybody in the world thought Shogun was the  best 205 pounder in the world.  He destroyed Rampage Jackson and their fight.  Um, he comes over here, he set him up in a fight with Forrest Griffin, which everybody  was like, that's mean, man.  Forrest is going to get killed.  Poor Forrest.  Forrest beat the shit out of Shogun.  Um, and then ended up choking him out in the third round. 
[02:46:30]  So this fight between, uh, Forrest Griffin and Rampage Jackson is a very interesting fight.  Hey, uh, Dana, how do you feel about all the guys trying to get into the fight game?  Uh, especially Mark Cuban.  And then there's a, there's a bunch of them trying to, you know, uh, get a piece of the  action.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, uh, like I said, I'm flattered that we make it look that easy that it's,  you know, you throw three letters together and buy a cage and you're in the fight business.  This is what we do 24 seven.  We do mixed money. 
[02:47:00]  This is how stupid it is.  I'm going to tell you guys how stupid it is.  Let's say we're all sitting at my house on a Saturday afternoon.  We're flipping a TV around and we, we, we land on NASCAR.  We're like, whoa, look at all the people at that race and they have a deal with Fox.  You know what we should do?  We should start a race league.  We'll start our own NASCAR league.  That's how fucking stupid it is.  Okay.  Uh, it's, it's not that easy to get into this business.  With that said, what I loved about the Rolling Stone article, you said that a lot of these 
[02:47:30]  guys don't realize that I do this, uh, with a lot of smoke and mirrors, like, you know,  that you have a talent to make this stuff, uh, look at that more impressive when you're  watching it, which way it makes me want to ask you, did you take any cues from Vince McMahon  as far as the, the way, uh, he hypes his, uh, his business and, and, uh, personalities and,  and, you know, cause it's really obviously it's caught on and, uh, it's got a different  vibe than it used to.  Uh, did you, I think, you know, I think our business model is a lot like Vince's in that, 
[02:48:00]  you know, we have a brand and we have all these stars.  It's inside the brand.  But other than that, no, I mean, I'm in the real fight business.  Vince McMahon is in the show business.  Okay.  The guys that he has are a bunch of actors and acrobats and, and shit like that.  The guys that we have are real fighters.  And at the end of the day, you know, you can have the personality of a fucking rock,  but if you go out there and knock people out and you're an exciting fighter, that's  what people want to see. 
[02:48:30]  And basically the thing that I am is I love the fight business.  I've loved the fight business.  I've loved it my whole life.  It's what I've always been into.  So I think I'm, I'm good at putting together the right fights and selling them.  Hey, congratulations, by the way, uh, uh, for making boxing look so outdated.  Yeah.  I can't even sit through a boxing match anymore.  I used to love boxing growing up.  Me too, man.  Boxing was my whole life.  And then, uh, you know, so many people had, see, that's one of the things you guys got  to understand too.  I, you know, I'm going to take a lot of heat because basically what we do is we, we have 
[02:49:00]  literally changed the fight business.  We took that industry, shook it up and changed the way that business is done, the way that  everything, I mean, if, if you knew anything about the fight business and you look at the  way we've changed everything, we've completely changed the business.  And a lot of people are having a hard time with that.  You know, people like, uh, this isn't how it's supposed to be.  Well, fuck how it's supposed to be.  Because obviously that didn't work.  Look at it.  Look at where boxing is now.  Yeah.  You look at boxing.  You're like, when are they going to start kicking?  When are they going to like start grabbing each other?  No one's even broadcasting fights. 
[02:49:30]  It's a, it's a, it's your heart pressed to even find them anymore.  Yeah.  Have you guys ever been to a live UFC event?  No, I actually want to go see Chuck fight, but he was, I was fighting in England last time  before his last fight.  Listen to me, this is no promoter hype bullshit.  This is the truth, man.  I'm telling you, you've seen the UFC on TV, you've rented the pay-per-views, you've seen  it here and there.  You have never seen anything in your life like a UFC live event.  Until you've seen the UFC live, I guarantee it's the greatest live sporting event you 
[02:50:00]  will ever see.  And you think you're into it now and you're hooked?  Wait till you come to, guys, if you guys want to, you're, you're invited to come to  July 5th, Griffin and, uh, and, uh, Rampage.  I'll hook you guys up.  I'm telling you, it will blow your mind.  It's the greatest sporting event you will ever see.  And where's that match taking place?  It's in Manly Bay in Vegas.  I would love to see that.  Well, we're going.  Hey, send your private jet, please.  Hey, also, I'm very happy to see Kimbo Slice.  He's, uh, he's, he's actually like, like, uh, uh, kind of like this, uh, this wild card 
[02:50:30]  that everybody seemed to know from YouTube and, uh, he's doing really well and he seems  to show a healthy respect for the sport as far as he understands that his ground, uh,  game has to be very strong before he goes up against a guy like Liddell or somebody like  that.  So here's my beef with Kimbo Slice.  I'll give it to you too, that he's, he's training and, uh, you know, he's training and taking  it serious, but this guy was fighting in backyards a few months ago.  The reality is if Kimbo Slice, if I put him on the ultimate reality show, he wouldn't win 
[02:51:00]  it.  Okay.  Kimbo Slice sucks.  The guy who he, uh, who he fought on the last show was one step away from being a fucking  corpse.  Okay.  And he barely got out of that fight alive.  So you think they're putting up against the softer opponents?  The fact that CBS is headlining their, their events with frigging Kimbo Slice, it's crazy.  I mean, anybody who knows the story about this business and where we were, even when we  were $44 million in the hole, man, we never went with the freak show angle. 
[02:51:30]  Right.  And, uh, Kimbo Slice is, is that freak show.  Do you think that they're purposely matching him up against, uh, cause Liddell is funny cause Chuck  said he has a healthy respect for the sport, but he's not, Chuck really was very dismissive  of his skill.  And I'm like, well, did you see those backyard fights?  Cause those weren't even that great.  So Liddell is obviously very unimpressed.  And, uh, do you think they're matching him up against softer opponents to kind of build  like this impressive record?  No doubt about it.  It's, it's the freak show angle.  You know, they're, they're putting this, this crazy looking dude that fought on YouTube,  but you know, uh, you know, on, on the show, we would never do that back in the 
[02:52:00]  days when we were losing money.  I mean, you're talking 10 years ago.  We, we, we thought about stuff like, well, what if we brought in Mike Tyson?  What if we did this?  What if we did that?  But we never, we never go to the freak show angle.  He's like the William Hong.  We stay true to the sport with real athletes, with guys who are the best in the world.  That's, that's really what we focus on.  And, you know, it's a little frustrating when people say, oh, this Kimbo Slice guy is,  oh, Kimbo Slice sucks.  Kimbo Slice would get, I'm telling you right now, I have 145 pounder.  His name's Uriah Faber. 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  He fights in the WC.  He, he's, he's amazing.  He weighs 145 pounds.  He would kick the shit out of Kimbo Slice.  Wow.  How many, would he go right to the ground, you think?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Hey, uh, Dana, what about, uh, Brock Lesnar?  What's your thoughts on him?  Brock Lesnar, the thing about Brock Lesnar, and, and, and, here you go.  Let's, talking about something like that, like bringing in a guy from the WWE, you know,  um, he, the difference is, this guy actually had a real wrestling background. 
[02:53:00]  This guy was a collegiate wrestler, um, NCAA credentials, you know, et cetera, et cetera.  And when we brought him into the UFC, we didn't throw a corpse at him.  We threw former world champion Frank Neer at him, you know?  I told Brock, I said, Brock, Brock talked to me and said he wanted to be in the UFC.  I said, this isn't, uh, you know, you're only going to fight the best here.  He said, I only want to fight the best.  You know, if I'm not fighting the best, I don't want to be in this thing.  I either, I either want to be credible and be good or, or I don't want to do it at all. 
[02:53:30]  And he got a lot of, uh, he got a lot of respect after his first fight with Frank Neer.  And a lot of people think he's going to be a force to be reckoned with in the next couple  of years.  Right on.  Hey, I know you got to go in a few minutes here, but really quickly, uh, you came for nothing.  You had no money growing up, right?  Yep.  And now you got to, you're just worth the bloody fortune.  What was the coolest thing you bought with your money?  Um, the coolest thing.  That's a good question.  Uh, uh, I think my favorite out of all the toys and all the shit that I own, I have a 
[02:54:00]  Ferrari and I think that's my favorite, my favorite toy.  It's a good choice.  Nice toy.  The coolest thing I own is probably my house.  I mean, you know, I love my house, but.  Oh, speaking of the house, uh, you, what, you built this outrageous pool and the neighbors,  uh, petitioned to get you to, to take the something, the cabana or something down.  And now you're being fined 2000 a month because, uh, the town decide, yeah, you need to take  this down or pay this fine.  And you've now decided you're just going to pay the fine for the rest of your life. 
[02:54:30]  Well, what happened is, you know what, guys, it's just like you said, I, you know, I, I  can't, I came from nothing.  I didn't have any money growing up or anything like that.  So I move into this great neighborhood, you know, and it's, you know, it's the who's  who in Las Vegas to live in my neighborhood, you know, a bunch of, you know, a bunch of  rich people all live here.  I move in and I'm like, finally, I'm going to live in a place where, you know, nobody  cares about what anybody else is doing, you know, you can do your own thing.  So I built this, this crazy pool in my backyard for my kids, you know, um, and we're in the 
[02:55:00]  pool every weekend.  We love it.  Well, the idiot that lives behind me, apparently doesn't like my pool, like I'm supposed to  give a fuck if this guy likes my pool or not.  Um, he doesn't like it.  And he goes to the, uh, he goes to the, uh, you know, the association and they have a big  meeting, a big hearing.  I got to go in there with a lawyer with this big hearing and basically coming out of the  hearing, they said, you need to tear the pool down.  Pool needs to come down.  Like, fuck you.  You're going to have to send a cruise missile. 
[02:55:30]  Okay.  And they said, well, we're going to fine you $2,000 a month until you tear it down.  How many, how many months have you paid?  How, how many months have you, how many months have you paid so far?  It's been, it's been over a year.  Nice.  That's the price of doing business now.  You know what, Dan?  Don't screw yourself.  Yeah.  God bless you.  And really fast because, uh, we got a gambler in the house here, uh, Blackjack, uh, Anthony's  played some big hands like yourself.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm fond of the game.  Um, it's the only way to really make money is to, uh, really risk a lot. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  He goes high stake.  It's, uh, it's, uh, had some impressive, uh, uh, there's nothing more exciting.  And, and to you, I mean, you know, you've got a few more bucks than me, but when you  got, you know, a couple of hands running and you got about $36,000 running on one hand,  it's, it's exciting, man.  No, it's definitely, I love playing Blackjack, man.  You know, I'm sure the guy, if you read the Rolling Stone thing, I mean, he was with me 
[02:56:30]  every night playing Blackjack, but it's, it's definitely one of the most, uh, it's one  of the most exciting things you can ever do.  Yeah.  But Dan, do they make you pay because, uh, you, you play in that casino where, you know,  it's your old friends and stuff that, you know, are in the UFC with you.  Do they make you pay?  Make you pay.  No, it's, it's, uh, no keepsies, you think, but it's their casino and they're in business  together.  So I'm thinking they go, ah, Dana, ah, guys, uh, listen, I lost 150.  I don't, I really don't want to pay.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, fine.  I got to pay.  Can I, uh, skip out on paying this one?  And, uh, do you have a big announcement today?  Yeah, actually the big announcement thing is, uh, I'm announcing it to my employees today  at 12 o'clock.  Um, you know, I was talking to ESPN about 10 days ago and telling them.  You know, they're like, where's this sport going?  Where, I said, well, I'm going to make an announcement to my employees when I get back  from England that's basically going to tell how far we've come and, uh, where we're going  in the next, uh, you know, five, 10 years. 
[02:57:30]  And, you know, so they put out this big thing about my big announcement.  It's a big announcement.  I don't know how, how, how fired up all the, uh, you know, the, the public's going to be  about it, but it's a big deal.  Let me tell you what, guys, I'm going to tell you right now, in the next, um, in the next  eight years, this is going to be the biggest sport in the world, bigger than the NFL, bigger  than soccer all over the world.  We're doing some, some, some crazy shit.  I, I believe it, man, because, uh, I mean, it's just taken off.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:58:00]  Well, think about this.  Think about how big football is here.  Think about how big the NFL is.  I don't care if you don't watch one football game all season.  Everybody watches the Superbowl, right?  The NFL has been spending billions of dollars trying to get over into Europe.  Nobody gives a fuck about football in Europe.  It's never going to happen.  They couldn't, you know why they didn't grow up, uh, playing it and they don't know touchdown,  first down pass.  They don't know.  They don't, it's like saying cricket's going to be big over here someday.  It's never going to fucking happen.  Okay.  I take two guys. 
[02:58:30]  I put them in an octagon and they can use any martial art they want.  It transcends across all cultural barriers, all language barriers, you know, as human beings  within our DNA, we love fighting.  We love it, you know?  And tell me this has never happened to you.  You're flipping around on the television and you land on the, on the, uh, Hispanic channel  and two guys are on there beating the shit out of each other.  And the guy's going, you don't talk, you don't, you don't even know what he's saying.  You don't have to know what he's saying. 
[02:59:00]  You get it.  You, you, you understand fighting.  You can watch it, you get it.  And then, and you like it.  Um, we're on television right now in 170 different countries on some, you know, and some of it  is in English and, and, and not even in their language.  And it's some of the highest rated stuff on television.  And like we were saying before with boxing going down, this is by far the most exciting  sport in the world.  And it, and it transcends across all cultural and language barriers.  It's going to be the biggest sport in the world.  Well, man, congratulations on all the success. 
[02:59:30]  Uh, we know, we know you got to wrap up, but, uh, you have, uh, let's just give it this  Saturday, uh, June 21st, nine o'clock on, uh, on Spike TV.  It's the, uh, the, uh, the ultimate, uh, ultimate fighter finale.  And, and then, uh, UFC 86, of course, is Rampage Jackson versus Griffin.  And then actually tonight is our, uh, is, is the ultimate fighter final episode, which  is 90 minutes long tonight.  Cause so much crazy shit happened.  Okay.  And that's on Spike, right?  Yeah.  Tonight at 10 o'clock.  And, uh, UFC 86, uh, Quentin Jackson, uh, against Griffin. 
[03:00:00]  And, uh, that's Saturday, July 5th.  It's live on pay-per-view from the Mandalay Bay in Vegas.  And, uh, Anthony will be there.  Yeah.  Hey man, we love, we love you.  You're real honest.  Uh, it's really, it's really refreshing to hear somebody just speak their mind and, and  not bullshit around about things they've said.  It's not, it's, it's pleasant.  Yeah.  And is Rogan still working for you?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Rogan's the best man.  Absolutely.  Don't ever fire Joe.  We love Joe.  He's the one that turned us all onto the sport.  He's the greatest.  Yeah.  When, when, when this thing was bleeding money and we were, we were, you know, we were trying  to get this thing off the ground, Joe Rogan started commentating for us. 
[03:00:30]  Joe Rogan commentated for us for free.  Wow.  He did about 13.  This was when fear factor was huge.  He was doing it for free.  And let me tell you, you know, I told Joe, I said, dude, when this thing, when this thing  catches, I'm going to fucking take care of you.  And I couldn't say enough good things about Joe Rogan.  He's gold, man.  He is gold.  Oh, excellent.  So what, you turned around and bought him lunch or something?  He's still working for free, but we put him up now. 
[03:01:00]  Hey, Dana, you fit in with this program.  We would love to have you on from time to time, man.  Oh, dude, I'm honored.  I'd love to be on it.  Whenever you want me, I'm in.  Right on.  Thanks a lot, man.  And, you know, we'll definitely talk to you again soon.  Thanks for the support.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Take care, buddy.  Dana White, everyone.  Thanks, Dana.  What a great, honest guy, man.  So nice to meet you.  Wow.  Not bullshitting.  Like, what, did you say this about Tito?  Yeah, he's a fucking asshole.  It's like, how great is that?  Who the fuck was in the background?  Hey, you got one more minute.  And it's obvious we're in the middle of something cool.  I got to say, the guy laid off.  It was just, the guy was probably doing his job. 
[03:01:30]  Because if Dana wanted to get out of this and do something else, like, he might have screamed  to the guy, going, why the fuck didn't you get me out when I was supposed to come?  That's true.  One more minute.  Yeah, good point.  One minute.  One minute.  One minute.  Yeah, and the phones.  Can we get the, I mean, I know we've only been asking since.  No, no, I think it was on their end.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, I really did.  What Mars was telling me was that it sounded like there was somebody else on his end listening  in on a second hand set, which was causing the feedback.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  All right.  Fair enough.  I was going to say, can we get them to stop that?  I really believe that's what was going on today.  I got to piss. 
[03:02:00]  I'm going to go piss.  All right.  And then we got, Lisa, porn star.  Where'd she go?  Thumbs up?  Oh, she's probably taking a dump.  Are you a fan?  Oh, no, she's right there.  Why are you here?  Just to hang?  Oh, my gosh.  It might be walking out there.  Well, we'll talk to her next.  Hello.  Hi.  You're a porn star, and are you just coming by to say hi?  Yeah, of course.  You're a fan of the show?  Of course.  Did Steve invite you? 
[03:02:30]  No, actually, I think it was.  It was Chris.  Who?  Yes.  I've met Chris.  Chris?  And I've known Jimmy.  I've met him a couple of times.  Who's Chris?  Who's the guy sitting next to her?  Jimmy rules.  You know Chris.  Yeah, he's a friend of mine.  He's creepy.  Which one?  The guy next to her.  What's up, Chris?  Yeah.  I didn't see him over there.  He's kind of a big head.  He's a nice man.  All right, let's talk to Lisa next, and more with Mike Birbiglia.  Hey, Lisa, you know how to take a black cock in the mouth.  Wow.  Where?  Holy mother of pearl.  I think maybe one or two at a time. 
[03:03:00]  Where is that?  Why am I watching fucking C-Span?  As I say that, they got wooing female voters on MSNBC.  Some fucking, some lady who looks like Katie Lang with fucking Howdy Doody's little bandana  around her neck.  That bitch off the television.  Black cock.  Lisa was just wooing some Obama, potential Obama voters.  Oh, wow.  Do you do cuckolding stuff, Lisa?  Do what?  Do you do cuckolding stuff?  Cuckolding?  Yeah.  Isn't that what guys do? 
[03:03:30]  No, it's when, like, you fuck a guy.  Hold on.  It's like, if...  I'm like, wait a minute.  I'm confused.  Wow.  If a guy in the movie is like your husband in the movie, like, you fuck a guy in front  of your husband and make him watch.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Oh, what a good girl.  Wow.  Nice.  You are getting pounded in the ass.  Where?  Yeah.  In the fart box.  Fucking nice.  It's not just there.  It's everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  I'm seeing that.  A lot of cum everywhere.  Oh, this is fucking fantastic.  All right, we're going to talk to Lisa Sparks next. 
[03:04:00]  It could be on C-Span.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Are you C-Span?  And Lisa's going to be warming up for Mike Birbiglia at Summer State in Georgia Park  on Friday night with Stephen Lynch.  That's right.  It'll be Lisa and the Harlem Globetrotters, and then...  And then Mike Birbiglia.  Yeah, I'd like that, Jimmy.  Sure.  All right, cool.  I like that anal sex one.  That is...  We're tuckered out from our Dana White interview.  Yeah, he's a fucking great man.  Let's go hold hands and pee.  All right.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful 
[03:04:30]  bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses?  I use Wow stickers around the house to keep raccoons away from my garbage.  Come here, little fella.  Oh, God!  Oh, God, it's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ, my balls.  Ouch.  Ouch.  My balls.  My balls are being bit by a raccoon here, people.  Dude.  Raccoon eating my balls here.  Raccoon on balls.  Anybody?  Do you see the raccoon dangling from my crotch?  Opie and Anthony!  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow stickers at opieandanthony.com. 
[03:05:00]  Derek, there's something hanging off your balls, man.  Mike Birbiglia in studio here at XM Satellite Radio.  What's going on?  How'd you like the Dana White interview?  Was it good?  I don't know much about that sport.  Oh, man.  Do people get killed in that sport?  The old days, pretty much, yes. 
[03:05:30]  They threw a couple rules in there just to keep it sane.  From people getting killed.  Not even safe, but just sane.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was...  I'm starting to watch more and more because when I first started watching,  wow, the guy would be helpless on the mat  and the guy would just be taking elbow after elbow after elbow.  Yeah, they wouldn't stop.  There was no stopping, no matter what.  Yeah, I respected that guy's tenacity.  Very honest guy.  He didn't give a fuck. 
[03:06:00]  Just over the top.  That's great, right?  Thrilled, yeah.  He's not some pussy who's afraid to yell that.  It's refreshing.  Lisa Sparks is on the bleachers.  She's a big porn star.  Let's have her come in.  Lisa.  A porn star.  No, sir.  I know it's not you.  What denotes a porn star versus a porn actress?  Hmm.  Here, go over there.  Is there a difference?  I think when you're a star, when you can do certain things that are really dirty. 
[03:06:30]  I want to be a porn character actor.  Do they have those?  I don't know.  How come everyone's a porn star or just not in porn?  I don't know.  Well, becoming a star, I think you have to have a certain number of videos.  Oh, okay.  How many videos have you made?  Over 300.  300?  I think any time you're acting and people jerk off looking at you, that clock watches a star. 
[03:07:00]  I've had sex like 85 times in my life.  85 times?  Yeah.  Wow.  That was like last week for me.  You've been in 300 movies?  That was like last week.  Oh, no.  Do you have a specialty?  Like, is it all interracial stuff?  Or is there anything you do that, or do all of it?  I do pretty much everything.  The biggest thing that I've ever done was I own the Gang Bang record.  You do?  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm reading a book about that right now.  Right.  Reading a book about it? 
[03:07:30]  919 is the record right now.  It's called Snuff, I think.  Chuck Palahniuk's latest book is called Snuff.  And it's about a girl setting the Gang Bang record.  Oh, well.  And they focus on...  Apparently it wasn't me then, because I didn't hear that book.  I just started.  I'm 10 pages in, but I just started reading this yesterday.  I'm giving Chuck Palahniuk one more shot.  Well, hold on.  Maybe she said it after the book was written.  Well, no.  I think it's...  I don't think it's a true story.  I think it's just Chuck Palahniuk kind of... 
[03:08:00]  Oh!  Does Guinness show up for that?  No, the Guinness won't do it, because it's too X-rated.  Really?  Yeah, they'll do weird stuff like the girl with the biggest boobs ever.  Right, right.  You know?  But they won't do, like, the girl who'll lay down and take so much dick, it's ridiculous.  So you set the Gang Bang record.  How many?  919.  In how many hours?  Seven and a half.  Seven and a half hours?  You got 919 in there?  How long?  How long about that? 
[03:08:30]  Like, how long would...  That can't be meaningful, right?  That's one guy, like, what?  One pump, and then...  It was 30 seconds each guy.  Wow, all right, that's substantial.  That's fucking twice for me.  Well, you know, but then I felt bad, because my girlfriend broke the anal record.  Oh, shit.  Right, and she's like, well, her anal record was only, like, 100.  Right, so I was like, okay, all right, that's great.  I challenged the record. 
[03:09:00]  No, I was like, somebody asked me if I would do it, and I was like, no, but I was a fluffer  for her thing, so that was cool.  Oh, yeah?  You'd get them all ready to...  I did, and then I guess at some point I broke another record for...  I wasn't trying to suck really good dick.  I was trying to, like, be like, okay, I'm gonna do it not so, like, normal that I would  do.  I had some...  I had, like, three or four dudes, and they were like, Lisa, you really have to stop getting 
[03:09:30]  the guys to come before she goes...  Before they go up there.  Oh, they were shooting while you were giving them head?  Yeah, they were shooting, and there was me and another girl, so we were getting them  ready, and then all of a sudden, they would go to her.  And I'm like, okay, that's cool.  Yeah, I didn't mean to.  What was this thing?  Let me ask you.  I really felt bad, because I kept telling them, I didn't mean to.  But at a gangbang, like, 9.19, 30 seconds each, they all have to obviously wear a condom,  and they just show up and say, I want to do this, I have ID? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, well, this is all done in Poland.  So, the company...  It's the same company that did Houston's 525, or 6001, or whatever it was.  I think she ended up with 625, but it's the same company, and after that, they couldn't  do it in the United States anymore, because...  Why?  Houston messed it up.  How?  I think that it was...  It wasn't put together properly, and then it was supposed to stop at, like, 525, and  she just decided she wanted to keep going. 
[03:10:30]  So, why couldn't they do it in the U.S.?  The union hit her with a fucking overcharge?  Like an inventive PNC?  Yeah, I don't know.  I just...  That was the last really big record I heard, and then from that point on, everything was  done in Europe.  I wonder why.  Don't you think at a certain point it's quality over quantity with some of these gangbangs?  I mean, it...  Yeah.  For the first 300, did you have some more, like, meaningful moments with some of the people,  and then after a while, you're like...  No.  I don't know.  855 felt a lot like 251, or whatever, you know? 
[03:11:00]  There was a guy who had, like, the most giant penis, and I'm like, really?  Do you realize I'm going to be here all day?  Why does this guy have, like, the biggest one I've ever seen?  Really?  Black guy or black guy?  It was a white guy.  Yes!  He should have been first.  Well, he was first, and then he was, like, 35th, and then he was like...  Then you don't feel the 918 that follow.  Yeah, I was like...  Oh, he just kept coming in.  Yeah, they kept rotating the guys, which is cool. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, you can rotate, and it counts?  Oh, that's cheating.  They did.  No, no, no.  That's cheating.  Sorry.  No, because they do it by insertions.  What do you mean?  All insertions.  Okay.  They do it by all insertions.  Except cocks going in, and then a cock comes out, and another cock goes in.  Yes.  So, I mean, I get that.  It's cheating.  No, Houston's 525 was only 200 bucks.  That's cheating, too.  I think there should be an asterisk in the record books.  I'm sorry.  Give me an asterisk.  I don't care.  It should be by unique visitors versus this.  I really wanted to do it here, and I really wanted to do 1,000, because I thought, dude, 
[03:12:00]  if I get to 1,000, if there is nobody else that's ever going to go...  1,000.  Yeah, I'm going to do that.  Were you sore?  Yeah.  When did you get sore?  After how many dicks?  I didn't even realize that I was sore until about four weeks later when a company goes...  When the uterus fell out.  Well, no, no, my agent was like, okay, you need to take a break, and I'm like, all right.  So about three or four weeks later, I got booked for a scene.  Yeah.  I was not expecting it to be uncomfortable on the inside. 
[03:12:30]  Oh.  Outside was perfectly fine.  Right, right.  Then I go to work, and I'm like, ooh, okay, can we slow down a little?  I don't know what to tell you.  And they're like, you had four weeks off.  And I said, I don't care.  It's still a little tender.  After the gangbang, it's all fucking.  Does it count if you're giving your guy head or if it's anal, or is it all just vaginal?  At about 800, they started letting us do blowjobs. 
[03:13:00]  So I guess technically, the record was 800 and something, but they counted everything.  This is like Japanese baseball.  But they had a guy at the end with like, I mean, he had, this guy had a, you know, he  was marking it off.  It was like, when I got done, like, the paper was this big.  Wow.  It was like an abacus with like 800 or 900 people.  I tried to set the anal record, but I stopped after one. 
[03:13:30]  And the girl, the girl who got the anal record, her name is Victoria Gibbons.  Yeah.  She did it with absolutely zero lube.  Wow.  That's like one of those fucking Sherpas that climbs Everest without the oxygen.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And I was like, how did you do that?  She was like, I just, she just prepared.  She's like, I prayed and I prayed to God.  I want to thank that Jesus.  Right.  What did she prepare?  How did, how does preparing take the place of lube? 
[03:14:00]  She ate a very strict like veggie diet so that.  What, she ate bowling balls?  Right.  I'm telling you, I thought it was weird.  Cause like, how did you do that?  And she's like, well, I just, I just went on a veggie diet so that, you know, it wasn't  gross.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  She's like, cause I didn't have steak and you know, I know it's disgusting.  I could get really disgusting.  I did not.  Don't worry about it.  I didn't know you could actually train to do some kind of gang bang record.  Yeah.  If you eat a lot of meat, it takes forever. 
[03:14:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, so did you tell mom and dad about the gang bang record?  What do they know about you and your career?  My mom knows what I do.  I don't necessarily know if she knows the record, but she knows what I do.  Yeah.  She's cool with it.  She's okay.  She didn't want to talk about it.  Like if she'll go, how's work?  I'm like, okay.  It's just like, all right, great.  No, we'll move on to another subject.  Do you tell your mom, are you cool with the new car I just bought you?  No, I haven't bought her a new car yet.  I'm working. 
[03:15:00]  I'm getting her a new house.  New house.  Right.  I see.  There you go.  I figure she'll like that better.  How did you get into porn?  Cause I don't think I've ever asked anybody how they get, I mean, obviously what were you  doing first?  Were you dancing?  Were you doing like private stuff or how did you get into?  I used to manage a hair salon for a chain, for a chain.  Jeez.  Rob Roy.  Wow.  It's super cuts.  It segues right in.  It's not super cuts, but they do own them now.  It's Regis Salon.  I didn't really need a real answer.  I literally, it's just the same company. 
[03:15:30]  Appreciate the fine line by Jimmy.  I literally worked for them.  And then my husband was like, why don't you, my husband, how does a husband suggest that  you go into porn?  Cause my husband was like, he's been suggesting it since the time I met him at 17.  He's just always been a porn guy.  Like, he's like, it's cool.  It's cool.  And, uh, took me forever.  I think I had to get to a point where I was just an adult enough to go, all right, let 
[03:16:00]  me try it.  And if I like it, you're still married to him.  Yeah.  I think adult is the key word there.  Um, I have a question.  Is your, is your, uh, is your husband a porn star also?  No, he runs my website.  That's what he does.  Gotcha.  He's tried and he just says, how do you have good sex with your husband?  Uh, you know, cause it's different.  It's, I, I, I honestly just want, I, I'll be completely honest.  I am the most boring person at home. 
[03:16:30]  Really?  Like we're not like jumping on the couches and in the kitchen, you know, I'm a good, I'm  a good missionary kind of, you know, give me mish, give me dog, give me 10 minutes.  I'm good.  You're not looking to get fucked like a movie.  No, exactly.  It's cause it's two different things.  Is it hard?  Cause I was very, I actually asked, uh, Bella Donna's husband about this.  Cause I'm so insecure about a person's, a woman's sexual past.  Like, uh, when I'm dating somebody, I'm like, well, how big was the dicks of the guy she  fucked?  And I just obsessed that I'm not going to measure up. 
[03:17:00]  Not, not just physically, but during the experience, I'm going to fall short.  She's going to be wishing she was fucking him and not me.  Like, how does, how does your husband deal with that type of competition?  He doesn't because there is no competition.  You know what I mean?  Like it's, they're completely different.  I go to work and I become Lisa Sparks.  I come home and I'm just Lisa.  Like it's, you know, I have a 10 year old and it's, you know what I mean?  Like I go home and people are like, there should be a TV camera for all you around. 
[03:17:30]  I go, really?  Cause they want to see me sit on the couch and watch TV when I'm at home doing nothing.  Right.  What was your labor with the kid?  10 minutes?  No, I actually, man, have you left something here?  Well, I had her before I did porn.  So it was like, I really did have a low labor though.  It was only seven hours.  You make good money?  I, I do.  I, you know, I make more money on my website than I do making movies.  Cause at this point making movies is really slow. 
[03:18:00]  The internet is everything now.  You know?  Tim H from Columbus, Ohio writes, this chick's father holds the record for longest crying fit.  So, um, he also holds a record.  Nice.  Do you, um.  Nice.  Cause you can't make movies anymore because nobody fucking buys them.  Cause you just go, you just jerk.  People jerk off in little segments now like, uh, hot movies.com is, is a site that had  don't hurt movies a lot.  Very good.  The adult DVD empire is a very big one.  Um, you know, it's just, everything's online. 
[03:18:30]  If you can stream it, nobody wants to go to the store, right?  Like I, you know, so I did, however, go to a store on the way here and I found, I was  like, do you have Lisa Sparks movies?  And they're all, and it's really bad.  They're like, who?  Oh boy.  And then I was like, no, it's cool.  Cause you know, not everybody in the world is going to ever know me.  And then I walked by and I'm like, so I want to see naughty America movies.  Cause I know I'm in those, you know?  And I'm like, I found about five or six movies. 
[03:19:00]  I was like, that's cool.  Do you work for like, uh, any of the major companies like evil angel or wicked or any  of those people?  I am working on trying to get with like Jules Jordan and evil angel and all them.  Uh, I befriended his girlfriend.  Who?  Jules?  Yeah.  Jules Jordan's girlfriend, Jenna Hayes.  I've been, I've befriended her.  And so now she's bugging him going, you need to get her in a movie.  Yeah.  I mean, why not?  If you want to do kinky, wild shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just that the thing is, is that it, I mean, like you can see me when I walk in, 
[03:19:30]  I'm a normal girl.  You know what I mean?  I'm like average.  I'm not a buck oh five and you know, I got natural boobs and how big are your boobs?  I will show you.  All right.  It is a wow.  So yeah, yeah, I know.  I will show you.  They're double D's and they're natural.  Oh my goodness.  What do you think, Mikey?  Thanks for throwing it over to me.  Throwing it over.  No, no, I'm probably the most conservative of them in the mix today. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  What's up with the runny nose there?  I don't know.  Yeah.  She's full.  That's good timing on that OB.  I don't know.  It's been running all day.  She's full.  I'm from Kentucky and it's been 2000 degrees humid and then.  It's either pollen or Coke.  We're just trying to figure out which one.  No.  It might be a little bit of both.  At least you're honest.  Did you have a long night last night?  No, you know what?  I didn't.  I just got in today.  I'm moving.  I'm buying a new house and my husband was like, I can't believe you're going to leave 
[03:20:30]  and make me move all the shit.  And I went.  Why are you in New York?  Just not working.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Can you dance anywhere?  Are you doing like film?  Are you doing private?  I'm doing private stuff.  I don't dance anymore.  I found out bad idea.  Wow.  I'm terrible at it.  I'm like.  The only thing you get is like my tits in your face and my ass in your face.  I don't know what else to do.  That's pretty much all you need to do though.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  We do have someone celebrating a birthday today.  Who?  We do have someone celebrating a birthday.  His name is Cream Pie Jones.  I love birthdays.  Look.  I love birthdays.  He's a film star as well.  You might remember him from our shit hat videos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was very popular with the shit hat video series that we saw.  The only thing is that the guy with the Celtics jersey on is just rubbing it in.  What?  Hip-hop Ronnie?  Yeah.  He's like just rubbing it in like, yay the Lakers won. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, you're an L.A. Lakers fan.  The Celtics won and the Lakers didn't.  Are you a Lakers fan?  Yeah.  I lived in L.A. for a while, so.  Yeah.  It happens.  But who's birthday?  I thought maybe you fucked the team.  Okay.  I'm heading over to the birthday boy.  All right.  Lisa Sparks.  How dirty can I get?  How dirty do you want to get?  Ah, don't even worry about it.  You better do something we haven't seen in a while.  How about that?  Yeah, just show your tits was.  What's the last thing you've seen?  Well, we had a porn star come in here and set the how many O&A staff members she could fuck 
[03:22:00]  a record, and that was, I believe, four.  And who was that?  Jimmy, do you remember the porn star that came in and fucked four of the staff members  to set the record?  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Steva Carlissia.  Yeah.  She was, uh, did you see the, I'm like, did you see the look on my face?  I was like.  Yeah, why?  No, just play it by ear.  Whatever you want to do.  You need music?  You need coke?  What do you need? 
[03:22:30]  Let us know.  What do you need?  Do what you want, and then, uh.  What do you need?  You know, if anything.  Don't make me sound like a drug addict.  Yeah, come on, Opie.  You're gonna ruin it.  Your nose is clogged and running.  I'm generally.  I just got here on a really bad flight.  Airlines do it, too.  And boy, is my pussy tired.  No, that's.  No, it's actually not tired.  It hasn't been used today, so it's not tired.  Is it shaved?  I've never seen your film.  She's fucking fantastic.  I will.  Hold on.  I'll let you.  I'm not rushing.  That's good.  Hold on. 
[03:23:00]  Hold on.  I got new clothes today from the Apple Bottoms people.  What?  Jimmy, what does it look like?  It's very shaved, and I did it today.  It's really, um, very nice.  She has very, it's kind of, it's plump.  It's tight, too.  It's really, it's nice.  She has a very nice pussy.  Considering 919's been in there.  919.  Is it silly to look at the guys all lined up with boners waiting to set the record with  you?  No.  What kind of record am I setting today?  Do they have boners, or like half of them are too nervous?  Because I, my dick wouldn't get hard. 
[03:23:30]  He's going to be too nervous.  What are you doing?  What do they do?  Do they have to shoehorn it in and all, and just kind of push it in for 30 if they can't  get a ride?  No, it's all right.  I just want to do birthday boys.  That mic's not on, Butcher.  I think birthday boys.  That's why people need to wear headphones in studio.  It's over there, but yeah.  Do they hand out the boner pills?  I did.  I stayed to work with a guy the other day.  No, I mean when they're setting the record.  I mean, you're assuming that some of these guys are going to have stage fright and they're  like, fuck it.  No, they don't do that in other countries, but that's only in America that they use Viagra. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Lisa Squire.  Cream Pie Jones, how old are you today?  Cream Pie.  21.  Could you give him a cream pie?  He likes cream pie.  I could try.  What cream pie likes.  I can never guarantee.  Cream pie is a cum eater.  I'm thinking it shouldn't take too long.  I think I'm pretty good at my job.  All right.  All right.  Let's see what happens with Cream Pie Jones.  Here we'll go.  We'll see.  Hey, Cream Pie, could you just sit farther away so nobody can see? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Right along.  By the way.  Are you a titty man?  Are you a titty man?  Why don't we get a mic on, Lisa Sparks?  As we do that, I want to go to Mike in Jersey really fast.  Mike, go ahead.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering if I could take a guess as to the name of the person who fucked four staff  members.  Sure.  Is it Don Wicklund?  That was the line.  Thank you, Mikey.  I got this.  Cream Pie.  What's up?  So it's your birthday.  How old again?  21. 
[03:25:00]  21 years old.  That's right.  Do you think you could come in my mouth?  Because it's my favorite.  Isolate that.  All right.  Not right now.  No.  Why?  What?  A little nervous.  He's a little nervous.  For what?  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Like, hold on.  Cream Pie.  What's the matter with you, Cream Pie?  If I get down here.  Oh, boy.  And I take your pants off.  Oh, that's not happening.  No?  No.  Why?  How big is your penis right now? 
[03:25:30]  I'm very nervous right now.  Cream Pie.  Is it small?  Hold on.  I'll tell you.  How about if she doesn't suck it?  How about if she just looks at it?  Wait.  Wait.  I got it.  Hold on.  I got the dirt.  That'll keep us all safe.  What?  Lisa.  Safe.  Make Cream Pie Jones make cumzies in his pants.  He doesn't even have to have his pants off.  Can I make you cumzies?  I don't know if that's possible right now.  That's really nervous.  I want him to make cumzies in his pants. 
[03:26:00]  Why are you nervous?  I don't bite.  I promise.  What's going on down there, Lisa?  What can you tell us?  Any action down there in his pants?  There's a little bit.  A little plumpage?  If I could touch it, it would be.  No, that's okay.  You won't let her touch it?  What?  Come on, you faggot.  You put shit on your head.  You wore a shit hat.  You wore shit.  I can't really just like disject it.  No.  No, it's not your fault.  Fuck that.  No, he's gay.  No.  But dude, you put duty on your head.  I'm soft.  Who cares? 
[03:26:30]  We all have soft penises.  I'll blow you.  I love you.  Oh, almighty.  I'm coming over here.  She's good.  Wow, you don't like cream pie Jones, huh?  Sorry.  I don't want to embarrass him.  He seems embarrassed.  It's your...  Let's just touch it.  I understand it's my birthday.  I don't want to thank you.  I really appreciate it.  I can't get blown.  You can't, but you can just touch it like that.  Can I touch it?  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  Just a little nervous.  Why can't I blow you?  Because.  Do you have a woman?  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey, wait a minute.  Someone has to make cumzies in their pants. 
[03:27:00]  Who's up for the challenge?  Is Cat Duffy here?  How about somebody just comes and then brings it to my mouth and I'll eat it?  Really?  You'd eat it?  Wow.  That's my favorite thing.  Wait, the new intern.  Hold on.  What's this?  Hold on.  Butchie, you got to put headphones on.  Then you know what's going on with the radio show.  I ask a million fucking times.  Who's the new intern?  E-Rich.  That's E-Rich?  Yeah.  E-Rich, come in.  E-Rich.  He waved his. 
[03:27:30]  E-Rich raised his hand when I said who wants to make cumzies in their pants.  I know, right?  I was giving him a little titty thing going on.  With Jimmy, I see that, yeah.  But see, the thing is, it only works with real titties.  Those are nice, yeah.  Have a few.  Okay.  They're big and heavy.  They're weighty?  They really are.  They're weighty.  They're like, they're fucking, how much?  About two and a half pounds a piece.  Sexy.  E-Rich.  What's up?  Don't do this and then go.  I think that was fun.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  He's pulling my nipple.  It feels good, normal.  You're all worked up.  Cream Pie Jones, you disappointed today.  I'm sorry.  Cream Pie Jones is a fag.  I know, you put feces on your head.  Yeah, you've got a weird line, man.  Oh, well.  No to cumzies, yes to a shit hat.  All right, I'm just going to wait.  Maybe if I wait around, don't do a cum in my mouth.  This E-Rich guy would do cumzies in his pants.  Right, E-Rich?  Sure.  Yeah, but would you let me suck your dick? 
[03:28:30]  If you want.  Sweet.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you, too.  All right, sit in the...  Sit.  I'll even give you the chair that I said in.  No, sit over there in the blowjob chair.  We've got a blowjob chair.  It's that one.  The Captain Kirk chair.  This is E-Rich.  I'd like to give a blowjob chair.  No, E-Rich.  All right, honey.  What's up?  He was already talking to me going, I know who you are.  Do you know who this is? 
[03:29:00]  You know who this is?  Get on the other side of there, but you know.  Would you like to see the whole action?  I can move to this side.  I don't really need to see it.  I don't worry about it.  Okay, I was just checking.  She's a good girl, man.  Fuck.  I'm like, I was just checking.  Yeah, no, you're definitely cool.  If there weren't 95 cameras here, I would not admit to being here.  Why?  I'm a ho-ho-ho.  Quality versus quantity.  Hi, honey.  How are you?  That's right.  All right.  I'd like to talk to them.  I don't know.  Where's, uh...  Hold on. 
[03:29:30]  Let's get Steve in here.  Where is he?  Why isn't he in here now?  Why would he be?  I was going to say because there's a girl in the studio.  I was just going for the line.  Steve, what do you think?  As you showed up immediately and blew my line, and it looks like you want to kill me.  Sorry.  You want above?  Are we allowed to do blowjobs?  Whoa!  Probably not.  Probably not.  Don't worry about it.  Here's the problem we're having.  It's not that we don't want it.  It's simply that we're currently having some legal stuff happening.  It's not that we don't want to.  But how about this?  Do you keep us under our arms?  Simulated. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Of course.  That's all.  Don't worry about it.  It's all simulated.  Simulated?  How about...  Hold on.  I think we can do comsies in the pants.  Yeah, of course.  Which I think is funnier anyway.  I know.  This is the best way to do that.  Elo does that every time the stock goes up.  How about we...  Hold on.  Lisa.  We want to bet.  We want to see how good you are.  We want to see...  We want to guess how long it's going to take for you to make comsies in E. Rich's pants.  Well, it's harder if I can't do the good stuff.  Well, don't...  I...  I'm going to work on it. 
[03:30:30]  I'm going to work on it.  She's a good girl.  Yeah, work on it.  Yeah, through the underwear.  I'm a professional.  All right.  Lisa Sparks in studio.  Yeah, just through the underwear.  That's a lot.  You all just got dirty lefties.  I was just making sure that I thought I could do it through the...  Nice.  I could whack my bag to this.  I just want to take a moment.  I'm in Cleveland next week.  I'm in Detroit.  Columbus.  Met Summer Stage this Friday.  Just a few plugs.  And who are you?  I'm Mike.  Hey, Mike.  How are you?  I'm Obi. 
[03:31:00]  I'm not watching anything that's happening, but I have a bunch of gigs coming up.  I'm telling you right now.  This is like...  What?  It just shows your true importance.  Who are you again?  We'll even kill it all morning long, but...  He's seen how my stuff works.  He knows.  Sucks.  What are you doing?  She's just touching him through his underwear.  I'm just working it.  Okay.  It's harder.  It's harder when you don't have the extra stuff to be able to do. 
[03:31:30]  Eventually, we'll be able to do that, but right now, we don't want to do anything that's going to get us fucking in trouble.  Yeah.  I agree.  Yeah.  I agree.  I don't want anybody to get in trouble.  If this was a man-on-man thing, then XM would say, go for it.  But when it comes to heterosexual stuff, I'm not even joking.  We had one guy sucking vodka out of a black guy's ass crack.  Ass crack.  That's fine.  That's fine.  But, you know, girl and guy action, that's icky to the guys in Washington.  How's E-Ridge doing? 
[03:32:00]  You all right?  A little stage fright.  Oh, yeah.  I would have a chance.  I know.  I can't...  That's what I said.  People always...  You know, men always think they can do porn until they get 65 cameras in the room and...  You know what?  I guess you're just not all that.  What can I tell you?  I don't know, honey.  If I could do it, you wouldn't get in trouble.  It wouldn't be a problem.  Yeah.  All right.  I promise.  E-Ridge, what's going on down there?  She's having fun.  I could take him home with me.  We could report it later. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nice.  At my hotel down the street.  Oof.  Really?  I'll take him home.  I have other videos that's been going around.  You guys haven't seen it yet, though.  What?  I'm like, dude, I can take him with me.  Wait, wait, wait.  If you can't miss him, I'll take him with me for a few minutes.  Hold on.  Sam's got some.  What, Sam?  E-Ridge, like, showing us all porn videos that he's made on his cell phone.  You make porn videos on your cell phone?  It's a recent new thing I've been getting into.  His first day here, he just started showing all the interns and then me and I think Danny 
[03:33:00]  videos of him fucking chicks on his phone.  Holy shit.  I fucking like this kid.  He's very burned.  Hey, how about this?  Is it possible they can just go into the sound booth or another room so he doesn't have stage fright?  I promise it won't take long.  Yeah, sure.  Just go in there.  And I really don't want to know what's happening.  No, just simulate it.  That's all.  I want to be able to tell a lawyer I really don't know.  It's not mine.  Plausible deniability. 
[03:33:30]  You'll be right here.  You'll never know.  Yeah, go into the other room there.  Okay.  We're moving to the other room.  Mitch, better.  Other room.  But Butcher or somebody.  Somebody has to go in there with a microphone.  Me.  And you want to go in there?  I want to, but I won't.  Just into another room and they can just, because he's nervous.  We need somebody from, who wants to go in there with that?  It's either E-Rock or Sam or Travis. 
[03:34:00]  Sam, young Sam.  What's going on over there?  I'm just getting, oh, nice.  I'm Mike Birbigley.  I'm giving you a summer stage this Friday night.  Yeah.  Next week I'm in Cleveland, Detroit, and Columbus.  So stay tuned for that.  Yeah, that's wonderful, Mike.  Do you feel uncomfortable today?  Oh, yeah.  I'll be right back.  Fantastic.  I'm going to get a report.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy will be reporting. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, because Jimmy's good.  Do we have a mic?  Yes.  I'm developing one.  I'm developing one.  There goes Jimmy.  Sam, how are you, buddy?  I'm good.  All right.  What's going on back there?  Well, E-Rich is sitting down.  Uh-huh.  And, well, yeah.  Why don't I hand it over to them?  All right.  You like boobs.  All right.  Let's give him some boobs.  All right.  E-Rich is getting some boobs.  Also known as feeders.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:35:00]  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  She's just stimulating it through his underwear, and he's very, very maturely handling it.  I don't want to turn the lights off.  That might be too creepy.  No, I said, who turned the lights off in here?  They're turning off the lights in here.  Jesus.  He's relaxing.  He's doing a good job.  And she's stimulating him through his underwear, and he seems to be enjoying himself.  I mean, uh, it sounds like Jimmy's calling, like, the U.S. Open, and, uh, Tiger works. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  I feel like I am.  Lining up for this part here.  Yes.  It's a playoff, and, uh, Tiger is, uh, taking a cock in his mouth.  And, uh, this kid's all bag.  He's a good boy, but he's all ball.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Sorry, Rich.  He's not able to work it?  No, no.  E-Rich is doing okay, considering the fact that he has fucking stupid, raceless Sam and me.  Cock-blocking.  And she, she just said, feel free to grab a titty, because she's, uh, she's really a 
[03:36:00]  good person.  I'm a trooper.  Yeah.  And he's a peeler, I think.  A peeler?  A peeler.  Well, he did seem to be of the ethnic background that would probably be a peeler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is most of the world.  Uh, Mike Birbiglia has left the studio.  Hold on, let's see.  Chase's girl is listening.  Mike, uh, said he had a lunch meeting.  I think, I think I, uh, I may have gotten gonorrhea from just sitting in the studio today. 
[03:36:30]  Hold on, Mike.  I want to give you a little audio of Lisa's simulating, okay?  This is just a simulation.  Right, sure.  Lisa, can we just hear this?  Ready?  Oh, God.  Yeah, that was very...  That reminds me, I didn't get my smoothie today.  Shit.  That was very believable.  And, uh, and, uh, if you would know what a trooper I was, I just took the mic and put  it right back to my face and then realized what I did. 
[03:37:00]  I'm really, uh...  And we have now Danny peeking in to further enhance the sexuality of the mood.  Danny goes back, chuckling.  She's very sexy.  Um...  Does anything look like it, uh, might, uh, happen or progress?  Uh, what do you say?  She doesn't want any warning.  I don't need a warning.  Just go for it.  I'm going to swallow the shit out of it. 
[03:37:30]  No warnings.  Okay, no warning.  Well, she doesn't want a warning.  Um...  No, you're talking about, um, a Moogoo guy pan.  Yeah.  Don't, don't warn her when the delivery comes.  This is very fun.  I'm just kind of standing in the Ron and Fez office, uh, watching pretty much what Earl  does all day.  And, um, and, um, young villain from the original Bad Boys is, uh, enjoying the, uh, simulation  he's getting from Ms. Lisa Sparks. 
[03:38:00]  And he's trying not to acknowledge me or a fucking Dr. Seuss character with an afro.  There's something oddly familiar about all this.  Yes.  What's that?  Nothing.  All right.  I guess the E-Rich is doing okay.  I gotta be honest.  The E-Rich seems to have gotten over a stage fright.  And, uh, he's pretty relaxed.  He kind of looks, his arms are really stiff right now.  Picture, uh, Malcolm McDowell in the movie theater in Clockwork Orange. 
[03:38:30]  Right.  And he's touching her shoulders.  And she's simulating, uh, her head's bobbing up and down.  And, uh, he has his underpants on, of course.  But it really looks realistic.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, someone...  Jimmy's voice is creeping out.  He's making a very weird noise.  And, uh, boy, this, Lisa Sparks is a good girl.  And, uh, just a lovely girl. 
[03:39:00]  Wowie.  How you doing here, E-Rich?  The thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  Yeah.  In the shape of a helmet with a bag hanging under it.  Uh, can Lisa talk, uh...  No, Lisa can't talk right now because she's, uh...  Yes, I can't.  Oh, she can.  I apologize.  My error.  Lisa?  I've got a little titty fucking action.  Sorry.  Yes, Lisa right now is, um, is, uh, simulating a good titty fuck on the young gentleman. 
[03:39:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, um, he's squeezing her breasts.  And she's, um, tugging.  Uh, by the way, we always have a tough time getting interns.  Um, Steve, take this audio and make the next intern commercial.  Oh, really?  For the opening of that show.  I know.  But she's not...  It's okay.  Just enjoy.  Um, hold on.  Hold on.  Someone's coming in here.  What the hell does he want? 
[03:40:00]  Lisa, do you need any help with that?  Let me show you what you're doing wrong.  Uh, is Uncle Paul there, uh, checking out the action?  Yeah, I don't, I don't like this because, uh, he got too much hair on it.  Once someone starts getting hair on it, they get really, really picky. 
[03:40:30]  And they start tatling.  Tatling.  What are you doing?  Do we have, um, I don't know, maybe Ted, the, the light bulb expert.  Why would, why would Ted be in here?  Of course.  I don't know.  Maybe you had to change the light bulb in the middle of the action.  No, Ted, Ted, the, uh, light bulb expert's not available.  Jim the Attic is struggling.  Hold on, let me turn the lights down a little bit. 
[03:41:00]  Did that help at all?  Okay.  You're welcome, E. Rich.  And, uh, this Lisa Sparks is a fucking trooper, man, and she's a sexy girl.  He's just nervous because we're, uh, do you think me and Sam in here are helping you?  Of course not.  Are you going to fake the ending?  Oh.  Oh.  He, E. Rich just called me an idiot, and he's right.  Why?  Because we're just keeping everything in the simulated terminology. 
[03:41:30]  Right.  Hey, could, uh.  Let me hear this.  What?  Can the intern go back to her hotel and make.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Thank you. 
[03:42:00]  Thank you.  Was that a transaction at Burger King?  Yeah, he's very polite.  Thank you.  You forgot to ask her for a receipt, sexy.  All right.  Can I please be the first to kiss her goodbye?  I double dare you to spit it in my mouth.  Treat me like a baby bird. 
[03:42:30]  Wine of the Day is sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Oh.  What happened?  Wait, can we get, we, what, what, did Lisa want to plug something?  We should plug, if she wants to website plug, it's Sparks, S-P-A-R.  She'd ask me to do this.  I'm just.  Lisa Sparks with three X's dot com.  That's her website.  Okay.  Lisa Sparks, S-P-A-R-X-X-X dot com, I think.  But she's really fucking sexy, and what a trooper.  What a cool chick, man.  We've got Keith Williamson.  He's 40, 40 years old. 
[03:43:00]  He's married, and he's looking for an internship.  Yes.  That's funny.  And, uh, what a good girl she is.  Wow.  Look at that.  Yeah, you're definitely a trooper.  I mean, uh, she's the real deal.  She doesn't fucking play games.  Apparently not.  She's not, as we like to say, a faker.  Are you, uh...  By the way, Cumzies is brought to you by Five Hour Energy.

Well, I would like to take this opportunity to say that, because we're closing up the show,  but, like, you know, you were very cool, and, you know, you should definitely come by and see us again.  Jesus, Jim.  Of course.  What are you doing in your pants there?  I'm actually...  No, I got, uh...  He was ready for me later.  I'm soft now, but I was enjoying that.  Yeah.  I couldn't...  Is it working?  No, I was flogging it in here while we were talking, in my underpants, and I had about  a good half going.  Oh, perfect.  He's sweating over there and shit.  Yeah, wow.  Jesus. 
[03:44:00]  Sweating like he just hopped the fence in green lighting.  He's a trooper, this kid, though.  You still got those videos on your phone?  Yeah.  You should go back to her hotel and make another video on your cell phone.  He seems like he's willing.  You like him, right?  He's a good kid.  He's clean.  He's a very good kid.  Do you want to bring some of the guys back to your hotel room?  Nice penis.  Yeah.  Would you like to bring some of the guys back to your hotel room?  I would take him, yeah.  I don't do gangbangs anymore. 
[03:44:30]  Wait, who's this girl?  Some regular chick.  Some regular chick.  Does she know you're filming her?  No.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes.  Smart boy.  What an ass on her.  Hey, hey, hey.  Not everybody doesn't have a badass.  You wearing a condom?  Yes.  Rookie.  I got them from here.  Rookie.  He's like, I bought them from here.  You got the condoms from here?  Yes.  Well, actually, once I made the mistake, that's not the one I use it in.  Steve keeps them with his hubba-bubba.  He actually broke, so then I learned my lesson.  All right, let me see that one there, pal. 
[03:45:00]  He's a good boy.  I got another one.  No.  You want to come over?  What about me, asshole?  The fuck?  Jimmy sees two?  Jimmy sees two?  Who's the one that just was in there navigating this young man through his experience?  You already saw one.  Okay.  Sorry.  Just want to see.  I never saw these covert videos like this.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Well, you're, um, oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  She has no idea the phone's out.  Oh, of course she does. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Is that the same chick as the other one?  No.  Different one.  Yeah.  Tony told me he wanted, he gave me an assignment, and now I have another one for next week.  Like, positions.  Oh.  Well, maybe she'll help me up, because now I won't have to, like, pretend.  It's, uh...  But whatever.  Yeah.  Here you go.  What a guy.  Just pulls his phone out and starts filming.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I like this kid.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Steve knows where to find these guys.  Oh.  Sure does.  They're on his mailing list. 
[03:46:00]  Lisa Sparks with 3Xs.com.  Anything else you plug in?  That's it.  That's the best place to find me.  How long are you in town for?  I leave you on Friday.  Wow, you're great.  Yeah.  I'm going to come see you tomorrow, so...  Very good.  Okay.  I'll talk to you, or I'll talk to Chris and let you know what it may be, because I might  can't...  Oh, no, no.  I just meant me and you.  I'm going to see you tomorrow.  Okay.  If I didn't have a girl, I would...  I know.  Well, bring her with you.  Maybe I will.  I don't do girls, but if there's a penis in the middle, I'll be all over it. 
[03:46:30]  I like that.  It's a good...  That's exactly what I say.  It's a good philosophy, right?  Yeah.  Well, you're all...  You rock.  You want your dick sucked?  You sure?  Cool.  All right.  I think we're ready for line of the day.  There we are.  Yes.  I don't think we could do any more with a radio show than...  Nah, it's pretty much it.  I think that...  What we did today.  Pretty much is the crescendo.  Sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive, so you never have to worry about losing any

Yeah, and then I feel like I'm going to die because my breathing is one of the building  blocks of living.  Mike Birbiglia, Summer Stage, Central Park, Friday.  I made it into one of the lines of the day. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  You had a great appearance today, my friend.  Thanks, man.  End on a day like this.  I was absent for part of it, but I really enjoyed the time I was here.  Yeah, when you came back.  That's all right.  Sure.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  It was the freshest sushi he's ever had in his life.  You sound like a very nice marine biologist.  Yeah, I know.  You know what, then they caught a catfish and kicked its face and threw it back in.  I just love it.  They destroyed that coral reef.  We poured a little bit of oil on it.  Right to the next runner-up line of the day. 
[03:48:00]  Sexy little thing line.  Sexy little thing line.  You know something?  Leave the sexy little thing line for the sexy little things.  Not the 57-year-old McCritta.  McCritta.

[03:48:30]  We had fun with that story today.  Oh, yes.  One more runner-up.  Hit it.  What's up with the runny nose there?  I don't know.  Yeah.  She's full.  That's good timing on that oak.  Fucking line of a month.  Damn good one.  Carbonite.com.  Thank you.  Everyone else set?  Lisa, you set?  I'm fantastic.  Very good.  I had fun.  You were great.  I think I'm a little bit tired now.  Wow.  That takes a lot out of you. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I'm all like, yeah, it was good.  That's like going to the gym for you, huh?  Yeah.  Just a quick little treadmill thing.  She has a very nice vagina, but that's very nice.  Oh, hey.  I'll show you before I go.  Well, you want to sit on something before we leave?  I don't know.  What do we got laying around?  Would you sit on something?  Okay.  As long as it's small and not a...  What's the weirdest thing you've sat on?  I'm...  Oh.  How about...  Where's Earl's pen collection?  That he chews.  I don't know. 
[03:49:30]  I don't know what the weirdest thing I sat on is.  What do we got?  What is that?  I can tell you...  Oh, we've been wanting to use this for a long time.  Can you do the hoppity-hop thing?  What is that?  It's called the hot seat.  Inflatable cushioned vibe.  Bouncing around has never felt so good.  Okay.  Hannah Harper's the hot seat.  I'm going to blow it up.  This could take hours.  Oh, Jesus.  Adam and Eve or AdamEve.com?  Adam and Eve.com.  AdamandEve.com provided us the kind of hoppity-hopper, hippity-hopper, 
[03:50:00]  or however the hell you want to call it, thing with a dick.  What do you mean?  Yeah, see, look.  Triple A's, double A's.  Look at this thing.  Do we even need the batteries, or is that just to make it move?  Yeah, it's just vibrating.  All right, blow it up.  All right, blow it up.  Why not?  Yeah, why not?  I haven't had sex today at school.  Lisa Sparks is a good girl.  How many times do they have sex a week?  You want to know the truth?  Yeah, probably.  Is this when I'm working or not working? 
[03:50:30]  Not working.  Not working?  Because working could be a shitload.  Exactly.  Not working?  Probably twice a month.  Wow.  See, that's a problem.  I've been married for 12,000 years.  But that's the hard part about, like, because you probably, that's the bad part about marrying  somebody who does porn, is that, like, he might be in the mood, and you're like, if  you look, let's be honest, if you have three or four fucking rough days, you're going to  go, ah, I'm not in the mood.  Exactly.  We got a guy that needs to, you know, fuck.  His name's Pat from Menaki. 
[03:51:00]  God damn it.  You know what?  Would you have sex with one of our guys?  He's clean.  He's clean.  How about that?  Well, how about, even if she's not sure about sex, maybe just oral sex or a handjob,  just something to...  They say, blowjobs I'm cool with.  I like doing blowjobs.  Maybe we could, ah...  Is Pat listening right now?  Maybe he could call the show.  I'm like, I'm big with blowjobs.  You're in town until Friday, right?  Friday, yeah.  Well, today's Wednesday, right?  Maybe tomorrow we could arrange for something.  Yeah.  Because, ah, Pat's a sweet guy, but he's had a string of bad luck. 
[03:51:30]  He's very clean.  He's nothing, nothing wrong with him.  Well...  Okay.  Let's see.  Yeah.  You'll see how you feel.  You guys meet, and you'll connect, and you'll season it.  You'll like it.  Yeah, Lisa's all about connection.  I know.  She has a...  No, you know what?  People always ask me.  She has a getting-to-know-you period, and it's about a four and a half second song.  Yeah, but it's like, people always want to know, well, what kind of man turns you on?  And I'm sitting there thinking, okay, well, A, I'm married to him, but B, somebody wouldn't  make me laugh.  I was like, I can give a crap what you look like. 
[03:52:00]  Right.  All right, then you're a little fat.  I'm like, but if you can...  I'm like, but if you can make me laugh, I'm okay.  You just described Pat from Monaki.  He's an odd-looking gentleman, but if he puts a light bulb in his mouth, it lights up.  Oh, Uncle Fester.  Okay, good.  He's got an Uncle Fester thing going on.  Here's Pat calling in.  Hi, guys.  Hi, buddy.  Hi, buddy.  Uncle Fester.  Here comes Pat from Monaki.  Pat?  Why don't you put him on hold?  I know he's...  Thank you.  Uh, Pat.  Yes?  We got Lisa Sparks in studio. 
[03:52:30]  She's a beautiful porn star with massive feeders.  And very sweet.  And very sweet.  And she wants to blow you.  Oh, really?  Yes, I'm going to blow you.  Yeah.  Wow, that sounds friendly of you.  I enjoy being friendly.  But Pat, she likes a sense of humor.  Now, we think you do have a fine sense of humor.  Oh, well, thank you.  What are your thoughts on Lisa Sparks blowing you tomorrow?  Just take turns. 
[03:53:00]  Hmm, tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Let me check my schedule.  Yeah, check your schedule.  I got tickets to the Yankees, so...  Oh, wow.  It'll either be before the game or after the game.  I'm sorry.  Pat, when was the last time you had sex?  Wow.  What century is this?  What century?  No, he's not joking.  He hasn't been laid in the 2000s yet. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  When's the last time you had a nice mouth on your penis, Pat?  Yep.  Wow.  Oh, that last time I broke my neck.  Oh, you're wrong.  How about this?  Maybe we can introduce you two, see how it goes.  No pressure, but you come in studio tomorrow.  Yeah.  And just see how Lisa feels, how you feel, and see where it goes.  I mean, you're both nice people.  And maybe, I don't know, Sparks will fly.  Sparks.  Oh, I get it.  Because her name's Lisa Sparks. 
[03:54:00]  They fly all the time.  What, Pat?  I'm always interested in meeting nice new people.  So, can you come in tomorrow?  Sparks will fly with three Ys.  Can you come in tomorrow at 9 o'clock AM at XM?  And get blown?  Just say yes, Pat.  What are you doing?  In, like, the studio?  In, like, front of people?  Well, no.  No, you won't be in front of people.  No.  No.  You'll be alone.  No.  You'll be alone.  Oh.  Yeah, but you guys remember my little issue there? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, relax.  It's all, there's no pressure.  Wait, what's his issue?  He's afraid his penis won't function because of his diabetes.  There's no pressure.  Oh, yeah.  I understand what he's saying, though.  Even if you just play a little bit and nothing happens, she doesn't give a shit and we don't  give a shit.  At least it's nice to be touched.  Diabetes makes his cum taste like vanilla ice cream.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  No pressure inside my penis.  Inside his penis.  Exactly.  See, there's the sense of humor.  PSI.  Yeah. 
[03:55:00]  So why don't you come in tomorrow at nine?  Okay.  There's no pressure.  Just take a nice shower.  Scrub out your balls and assholes until she's kneeling there.  It doesn't fucking reek like onions and nervous Pat sweat.  Okay.  It's hard to get a boner with my diabetes.  Yeah, you got to prepare the area, Pat.  Maybe a good shave down, you know.  Okay, yeah.  Do a little trimming.  A little trimming.  That's right.  That's very nice.  That's very polite.  And if you have Coke, she'd appreciate it, so. 
[03:55:30]  Stop.  Regular diet.  Come on.  Diet.  It's diet Coke.  Diet Coke.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, Pat.  Okay.  Wow.  Sounds like fun.  You didn't expect this phone call today, now did you?  No, I didn't.  What are the odds you will do this, Pat?  He'll come.  Oh, really?  The odds, I think there's a good odds I'll be crying.  Like, Big A, last time he had somebody pulling carrots on him. 
[03:56:00]  There's no fucking, Pat, there's no pressure.  You can just play with the breasts a little bit.  You don't have to fucking bang her or get a rod.  Who cares?  It's just fun to know that you're in the other room doing that.  You'll be alone in the room.  Yeah, you got some big boobies to look at.  They're beautiful, too.  I got big boobies whenever I take my shirt off.  All right, Pat.  She's looking for a sense of humor, not a sense of sadness.  Exactly. 
[03:56:30]  Really, Pat, come on.  Get a hold of yourself.  All righty.  Get a hold of yourself.  All right, so we'll see you tomorrow, Pat, okay?  That's what I usually do.  Get a hold of myself.  Can you, would you let...  I'm just digging a hole.  Oh, it really is.  Would you let Pat eat your ass, Lisa?  Oh, sure.  Pat's really into ass eating.  Okay.  Is he real?  When did he tell you that?  I'll make sure it's nice and super clean tomorrow, but yes.  I'm a competitive eater. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, that Pat.  I think before the finale, I'm going to head out.  Come on, what you want?  What?  What happened?  What?  You're just going to bounce up on the penis?  What?  Oh, look at Pat.  Nice.  Is the apparatus scaring you, Mike?  I think Mike got scared by the prop we brought in.  Look at that thing.  Good Lord, have mercy.  It's a penis seat, but you can take that.  I guess it'll be...  Yeah, Mike, what happened?  Yeah, I mean, Shawn Michaels, like he said, you know, that's not me. 
[03:57:30]  I think if she fucks that, the terrorist wins.  Well, a la Akbar.  I'm old, man.  I'm old.  Thank you, Danny.  I wonder why nobody else comes in with a microphone that's fucking...  I might get a laugh out of this.  I don't know.  No, we have...  She's just...  She's walking around like...  Are you going to...  Do you need any preparation for this?  No.  All right.  There's some lube there for her.  She's wandering around like...  Who needs the lube?  She's wandering around like...  All right, get out of the way. 
[03:58:00]  I'm like, a little bit of spit.  Who needs anything?  Give me your face this way so we can see your vagina.  Thank you.  Whoa, it's a nice plump.  Do you just want to see my vagina all day?  I do.  It's nice.  All right.  Jimmy, explain what she's about to sit on.  All right, now, but she's got to get out of the way.  I know.  Whatever it is, they're pure for whatever the same is.  She's slaughtering.  He's in my way.  It looks like a little seat.  It's a seat.  Hold on, Lisa.  You got to move your dress.  I know.  Hey, I'll call the dress out of the way.  Hold on.  I'll get it when I get on there.  All right, she's getting the patient with me.  And she's just sitting on this penis seat, and she's bouncing up and down very effortlessly. 
[03:58:30]  I am.  She laughs at this little seat.  I do.  This is small compared to what I go for.  All right, so we just...  Wow.  Why isn't Mike looking?  It's really nice.  Oh.  She's bobbing up and down.  She's being fucked by a seat.  It's nice.  I'm like, does this thing...  We call this the Abner Louima chair.  We call it the what?  Oh, just...  Oh, that's nice.  Are you digging that?  Wait a minute.  That's nice.  Very nice. 
[03:59:00]  Do you like that?  It's not bad.  I can take it home and have a good time with it.  Yeah?  She's banging the seat.  Nice.  Not quite like a man, but you know.  Of course that doesn't fucking come quick or bother you.  Exactly.  It does not bother me.  She has a really nice vagina.  I'm all...  Oh, fucking nice little fat lips.  I do.  I have...  I have the good ones.  Yeah, big fat ones.  I know.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[03:59:30]  Ooh, that was fun.  But now, at this point, you know what's going to happen?  What?  Now I need a man.  Like a real one.  Ain't going to find one here.  No, no, no.  I need a real one that's, you know, going to go and do the whole beginning of it.  Did anyone else hear that thing power down?  Yeah, I know.  That thing was...  That's like the end.  That thing power down.  You know what I mean?  Like, that's the end of the day.  Oh, my God.  Lisa Sparks, a true trooper, will come in tomorrow. 
[04:00:00]  I know.  And she'll be in tomorrow at 9 o'clock.  And Pat, we're going to introduce you guys, okay?  Okay.  Sounds good to me.  Don't forget the website, though.  LisaSparks.com.  It's Lisa, S-P-A-R-X-X-X.  Just think Triple X.  Right.  Triple X, that's nice.  Dot com, and you can Google it.  You'll find her website.  It would be stupid with only two Xs.  Yeah.  Sparks.  Is that stupid?  There's just somebody else that was using it before me.  But Triple X is way better.  I agree.  It's way dirtier.  Way dirtier, yes.  Way dirtier.  Yeah.  I'm glad that you guys had me on. 
[04:00:30]  You were very fun.  I was excited.  After seeing Jimmy do our stand-up, that was it.  Oh, yeah.  You guys came at night.  I did.  Oh.  And you know, you did a joke that was really funny, because I said the same thing like  six hours earlier.  What was it?  That John McCain joke, which is really funny.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  By his arms?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've been saying that for like weeks.  I'm like, no, that just can't happen.  That's a good thing about it.  That you said it.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's, uh, Lisa, what's the joke?  I would love to hear you tell the joke. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, he did a joke about how John McCain's arms don't go too high.  Right, but what were you saying?  And it'd be very difficult to have a president that can't get, like, really excited.  Right.  I don't know what his exact words were, but...  That's the good thing about Norton.  He tells the jokes you thought of, too.  And, you know, I'm not a comedian, so, like, it was just funny with a friend.  That could be the best endorsement for Jim Norton.  It was just funny.  Porn stars have thought of his jokes in advance.  Right.  Wow.  No.  But it was weird to be like, really?  Somebody else has that opinion?  That's why I'm a man of the people, because I notice the same things that the regular folks 
[04:01:30]  do.  Exactly.  We all notice them, and I just bring them to the stage.  Observationally, Emma.  What's with that vagina?  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  That wasn't bad.  It's bigger than a sock closet.  All right, Pat, you're getting fucked tomorrow, or something.  Okay.  Did you say, okay?  Did I just say, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pat, you know the guys have been trying to, you know, get something going for you. 
[04:02:00]  We finally got it, so tomorrow's the day.  Wow.  We're having fun.  Go to bed early.  Don't be nervous, and you come in tomorrow.  No, you know what you do is you whack it off tonight.  All right, yeah.  So that tomorrow you're ready to go.  20 years.  20 years?  He hasn't had sex in about 20 years.  There's going to be a tsunami in that studio.  Okay, never mind.  Don't.  I want the more, the merrier.  Wow.  Okay.  I think she, I'm getting the impression she likes cum.  I do. 
[04:02:30]  It is my daily protein.  She doesn't just like it.  No, she doesn't.  I love it.  She's going to go home and write a half hour for Norton.  I'm telling you, I've done some of the weirdest things ever.  Like what?  I did a, a, a bukkake movie.  Well, tomorrow I'll be no different.  I, you did a bukkake, uh.  I did a bukkake movie for the company, uh, called American Bukake, and I did it with  a, like, you know, like a, whatever you call it, mask, scuba mask, scuba mask, with 
[04:03:00]  no scuba cover.  Well, tomorrow you can do that.  Oh, wow.  So it like filled up.  Yeah, so everything filled up in there.  So it filled up in the mask.  Yes.  Because you took the glass off the scuba mask.  Yes.  So it was like.  Just your eyes?  Just my eyes.  A mask full of jizz.  Wow, what'd you do with it?  Like just, did you, did you shut your eyes off?  When I was done, I was like, okay, my eyes are killing me.  Yeah.  I was like, so I need to go home.  I feel like the female listenership is down today. 
[04:03:30]  Probably.  I'm a little bit, yeah, I'm a little dirty.  Girls don't tend to like myself.  Really?  Fuckin'.  Yeah.  But boys will be up, like, 100%.  I try.  When did you find out you love the taste of cum?  I've always liked it.  Yeah.  When was that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  When did you have sex the first time?  The first time was 16, but.  That first load in your mouth, you don't remember?  It wasn't 16, I think it was like 18 or 19. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And then you were just like, God, I need more of this shit.  I was like, it just doesn't bother me.  And now at this point, after being in the business, I can tell what people can eat, what  people are eating.  Wow.  That's like a low job dietician.  I know, I'm like, you really should stop smoking, or you really should start eating, like,  more vegetables.  How great is that?  Oop.  Cholesterol needs work.  Yeah.  The first word after me will be, hot dogs.  God, dogs.  Wow.  Pat, you just got to talk yourself out of a blowjob. 
[04:04:30]  Hang up.  Say, I'll see you at nine and hang up.  No, use lad bag rights.  Once she finishes off Pat from Monaki, she'll be making a Baby Bird 2 video.  Hey, let's just say if, like you, I don't know how to say this, you know, with E. Rich  from a little while ago, what would his diet consist of, would you guess?  Well, I don't know. 
[04:05:00]  Had to be beans.  Beans, rice.  It was very healthy, whatever it is.  Because when you don't, when there's no taste.  Broken bag of heroin.  Mewing into the country.  Maybe it was Coke, I don't know.  It would be funny if she knew exactly his diet.  Well, last night he had a steak medium rare.  And normally he'd get the fries, but apparently they were out of them because he had the baked  potato with a diet Coke, which is not far from the course.  He had the Italiano sampler at the Olive Garden, but he didn't have any marinara with it. 
[04:05:30]  Smokers are easy to tell.  People who don't eat them.  Why?  Because when they come, their dicks go, ah!  No, it actually just smells like smoke.  Wow.  Their loads do?  Yeah.  Ew, old smoke loads?  Yeah, it's like, it's like very, like, you know, you kind of have a little smokey.  It's like beef jerky.  That's awful.  It's a smoke.
