<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed their tumultuous transition to their new SiriusXM studio.  The show began with overwhelming negativity towards the studio's design, focusing on the cramped space, poorly positioned consoles and chairs (resulting in constant bumping), excessive glass offering a full view into the hallway, and inadequate technical setup, including monitor, internet, and microphone issues.  They exaggerated these problems humorously, suggesting absurd solutions for the unusable console space (a chocolate fountain, ice sculpture, Gettysburg reenactment) and focusing on a running gag about the hallway's excessive length measured in an employee's (Kenny's) shoe lengths.  Several SiriusXM employees were mentioned throughout, including Kenny, Travis, Steve, Danny, Sam, and Mars. Anthony also repeatedly mentioned his upcoming appearance on Sean Hannity's show. A listener suggested "Das Booth" as a name for the studio.  The deaths of Mark Fidrich, Marilyn Chambers, and Harry Kalas were also discussed.  They planned a bit involving hallway interviews using an external microphone. The segment ended with continued complaints about the studio's flaws and temperature.


The broadcast continued with more discussion of the new studio's features, comparing their window treatments to those of the neighboring OutQ channel. They plotted a potentially destructive prank involving bowling a ball down the glass hallway and brainstormed "Scratchiti" ideas for the windows.  They discussed a planned anti-cell phone driving technology and a karaoke cab driver encounter in the Cayman Islands. A significant portion critiqued a Billy Bob Thornton interview, playing clips and using derogatory terms to describe Thornton's behavior and the interview itself.  Sam conducted brief hallway interviews with SiriusXM employees from "Morning Mashup" and "Celtic Crush," noting one dismissive interviewee. They shared a video of a woman falling into a polar bear enclosure and recounted vacation anecdotes, including one host surreptitiously photographing women and another's girlfriend's dolphin encounter.  The segment was rife with vulgar language and off-color humor.


The show then focused on hallway antics, using long microphone cords to conduct impromptu interviews with passing employees, many of whom visibly avoided them.  Conversations revolved around the hosts' reputation ("the word is not good"), their excessive number of televisions (twelve, a source of resentment for others), and the general disruption they caused. Tangents included discussions of a man stung by thousands of killer bees, Ted Kennedy's terrible first pitch, Jimmy's vacation photos featuring a cock ring, the Mets and Yankees, a wheelchair-bound man ramming his ex-wife, and various pornographic videos, including one featuring a woman with extensive pubic hair. A call from a pilot who had to land a plane after the pilot died was also played.  They also discussed a Polish politician criticizing a zoo for having a gay elephant.  The segment began with discussions on logistical issues, such as arranging for food and drinks (grapes and Muscle Milk).


Finally, the show focused on their studio's previous occupant, Alex Bennett, whom they repeatedly and harshly criticized with offensive terms.  They highlighted their studio's twelve flat-screen TVs in contrast to Bennett's perceived lack thereof, a running joke.  They detailed their unsuccessful attempt to get approval for a "wall of sound" outside their studio, and mocked an intern's gait using crude terms. A comedic role-playing skit portraying themselves and Bennett (played by "Z-Rock") and his co-host (Travis), based on a purported angry phone call from Bennett, dominated a large part of this segment. They extensively discussed Bennett's perceived bitterness and lack of success.  They also discussed a passing out incident on Glenn Beck's show,  played a 911 call about a domestic dispute, and conducted more hallway interviews highlighting the contrast between their setup and the rest of the building.  The show ended with further discussion of Alex Bennett, including references to his Wikipedia page.  The death of a Dungeons & Dragons creator was mentioned, with a Steven Lynch song played in his honor. The broadcast concluded with banter with a long-time staff member, Garrett, and final show plugs.  Anthony again mentioned his appearance on Hannity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Alright, we'll try this.  Hey!  How you doing?  You good?  How does this sound? Is it okay? Is my mic good?  How's my mic good?  Give me mic check, mic check. How's your mic?  Fine, O.  Yeah.  Yeah, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony closet. 
[00:00:30]  That's Siri XM. Radio.  Yes. Our new digs.  Wow. Start writing down the problems.  Isn't this something?  Yours sounds very bassy.  A little Count Bassy.  But, yeah, I think it's just you've got to get used to it.  I don't know. They could tweak it a little bit.  They'll be tweaking.  You know what? I just noticed, and I'm freaking out.  I have no feedback from people.  What do you mean?  I have no input from the audience. 
[00:01:00]  No, one of those screens goes to instant feedback.  You have to decide.  Oh, great.  Didn't you used to have, like, 18 screens in front of you?  Yes!  Now you're down to two.  Down to two screens. I don't know what to do.  I'm just going to sit here and twiddle my thumbs.  You feel, you look very awkward.  I look, because usually I'm reading.  Like, people, you know, put things in.  You will never hear me go, oh, and Steve from Bayshore says, because I don't know what he's saying. 
[00:01:30]  It's weird. You're actually paying attention.  No, don't get carried away.  I can still get E-Trade on this thing.  We've got a lot of tweaking to do, obviously.  Yeah.  I figured we'd come in here and give it a shot, see what this thing could do.  This is exactly what we asked for, though.  We said, look, on the console, we'd like to store encyclopedias.  Can you please leave some room so we can store encyclopedias?  And they did.  Right in the middle.  There is a vast wasteland in the middle of this console that I guess could have been better used at the peripheral of the console, you know, by pushing it in. 
[00:02:00]  And we're giving us more room in the rest of the studio.  What we should do every day, we should have something nice in the middle here.  A centerpiece?  Maybe we could start with a chocolate fountain.  An ice sculpture.  With little fruit skewers.  Dip our fruit in the chocolate.  I want little soldiers to do a recreation of Gettysburg.  The Battle of Gettysburg in the middle of our console. 
[00:02:30]  Jimmy and I could play a giant game of chess.  You could play shuffleboard.  We could use real live people.  All right, move, fatso.  You're my rook.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  This is like our 20th studio since we started working together, I think.  Yeah.  Ah, what was I going to say?  There was something, something, something, something, something.  Well, yeah, there's going to be a lot of somethings today. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, I know what it was.  It's when you get radio guys like we are and then engineers together, they don't understand each other.  Yeah, yeah.  There's definitely a kind of miscommunication sometimes.  I know it's a visual, but I want it to be way back near this wall.  Yeah, yeah.  You could have been set back another couple of feet.  I mean, the faithful listeners, though, but the average listener doesn't.  This studio is a lot smaller than we're used to.  So, you know, we're trying to do the right thing and just, you know, deal with it. 
[00:03:30]  So we came in here.  We said, all right, we're going to need to use all available space.  Yeah.  So I said, move me all the way back here and that'll give us another foot in the studio so we could, like, get some things done over there, right?  Yeah.  And I just heard that the engineers thought that was crazy that I wanted that.  That's crazy that he wants to be up against the wall.  I can't live with that from my office.  Yeah, exactly.  But we're here.  They set this thing up and then we have to, like, drive it every day. 
[00:04:00]  And then, of course, the big, huge table in front of us, that's a waste of space.  At least another foot we're losing there.  And then we got an Anthony problem where Anthony.  Oh, my God.  This one is.  This started back in CBS in the office.  There was barely any room between the back of my chair and, like, where Danny and Travis and everybody else would sit.  Or Danny and Sam would sit. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  So everybody that walked through, and I must say Steve is probably the biggest perpetrator of this, would hit the back of my chair.  And it just became this thing where every time I get jolted on the back of my chair, I grit my teeth and it drives me crazy.  It's one of my pet peeves.  It's a big one.  Where people hit the back of my chair while I'm trying to sit and read or do whatever the hell I'm doing.  Right.  Well, I am now put in a position here at the console where there is probably one foot behind my chair and the wall. 
[00:05:00]  Actually, we wanted to push that back, too.  And the wall.  Yeah.  So now, that wouldn't be bad if we just made this, hey, no one can walk behind me.  Right.  But, unfortunately, it is the only way to get to Opie, who is constantly getting discs from the staff and papers and everything else. 
[00:05:30]  So everybody has to walk behind my chair and is slamming into it.  All right.  Be honest.  How many people have hit your chair so far?  Five people.  Five people.  Five people have hit my chair.  Travis is the best because he is but a toothpick.  And Steve hits it no matter how far I push my chair forward.  Steve will still hit my chair.  So that's another issue. 
[00:06:00]  I guess we're going to try to cut out a little, I don't know, a little spot for me.  A little half a circle, maybe, that they could push your body into the table and take Henry VIII.  Yeah.  I'm just going to be.  And I know people are just going to be like, you know, especially the people that did this.  They're probably sitting right now going, these sons of bitches.  Of course they are.  Shut up.  We worked hard.  We got this studio done in time and everything.  We're not getting on you about that.  I mean, that's what it is. 
[00:06:30]  We're going to have to tweak a little bit.  That's all.  It's a nice table.  We said we wanted a console slash bowling lane and they provided one.  We should set up a little badminton net.  Play a little badminton.  There is more space in the middle of this console than any one of us have in front of us.  Yeah.  Like, you can't, like, Jimmy can't hand anything to Opie.  No.  It has to go, I think, through me first.  We used to be able to, like.  Perhaps into a different zip code.  We used to be able to just hand each other stuff.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  We should get those things that they used to use in the post office, like, in the bank when you put it in and it goes, oh, vacuum tubes.  Yeah, and it just sucks it up.  Vacuum tubes it across you.  That's not a bad idea.  And then they're bringing couches in here.  That's.  Yeah, well, I guess we need places for somebody to sit.  Yeah.  That would probably be good for if we have numerous guests.  They can sit there with mics in front of them and touch each other's knees.  Yes.  And what about the glass? 
[00:07:30]  Again, there's nothing but glass.  I can see, I swear to you, we are at one side of the building.  Like, I can see the window outside of this building.  It's cool.  Now you know how we're going to exit.  Just a running leap.  Like, on the other side of the, I can see the other side of the building.  Let's just put it this way.  Kenny's been walking toward us for the last two minutes.  I know.  I'm watching Kenny.  I can see him.  He started as a midget, and now, look, he's a monster.  It's like a Get Smart episode, but not Get Dumb. 
[00:08:00]  Look, and now there's a new guy walking.  They just walk forever.  It takes forever.  You're walking.  How many feet is that?  Do we have, like, some kind of.  Oh, my God.  That's the first thing we have to do.  That's a football field.  Kenny, how many of your feet?  Go all the way from there to the window.  Look, he started.  He's going toe-to-toe.  He's not even pacing it off in yards.  That's beautiful, though. 
[00:08:30]  He wants feet.  Look at how stupid he looks.  Well, because he's an OCD freak, and then we'll measure his foot.  Jesus Christ, he wouldn't pass a friggin' sobriety test.  Yeah, I see that, man.  All right.  There he goes.  Is that Sam way down there?  We'll tell you.  I can't tell if that's Sam or some hot chick.  Yeah.  Oh, this is beautiful, though.  When the bosses get pissed, we'll know they're coming a mile away.  Yeah, finish up the show, go home before they get here.  Yeah, we could just run to the left and get out of here.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  What are you doing?  I see about six exit signs running down the whole length of that hallway because it is huge. 
[00:09:00]  It has to be the length of a football field that is completely visible because everything is glass in here.  That is at least 50 yards.  At least.  Oh, it's way more than that.  Kenny's still, like, you know.  He's not even halfway there.  No, he's still measuring.  And take into consideration the conference room, too.  Do you guys like the TVs that are almost down to the floor, by the way? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Well, those are yours.  That's Jimmy's.  No, mine are behind Oop's head.  Okay, that's it.  Mine are here.  And to the right.  Where I get to look at Danny also.  Hi, Dan.  This is like a dollhouse.  Yeah.  The TV monitors are okay.  Well, they have to be moved up a little bit, but that was a big deal, too, yesterday when I was saying that.  Well, the thing is, you'd think that they would get some type of cable plugged in.  It's like they put shit quality on these TVs. 
[00:10:00]  How about you get some clarity and crispness?  Look at the static.  It's fucking horrible.  I haven't seen static in years.  I thought it was impossible on digital television to get static.  It's like watching Scared Straight for the first time in fucking 1977.  Sam's out of mic.  I'm going to guess.  Oh.  I don't know.  Mic four.  Mic four?  Just look for twink.  Out of breath?  Yes.  A lot of exercise from the office down here, isn't it?  You ran from that side to this side?  From the first office, yes.  Right.  From the producer's office, it's 100 Kenny feet. 
[00:10:30]  100 Kenny feet so far?  Wow.  He's still going.  He's still going.  He's still going.  No joke.  He's still going.  Please, somebody mess him up on the counters to start over.  There he is.  I've got to do it again.  Yeah, we saw you walking like a penguin.  I was running.  Yes, you are running.  It looks very silly.  You run very silly with your weird legs.  We should close that curtain, I think.  You mean the curtain on your legs thing? 
[00:11:00]  No, no.  I mean the curtain that makes it so that you can see me run up and down the hall.  Oh, I got you.  I'm the only one in the office.  Figuratively speaking.  We do have these huge, heavy curtains to block us in here.  Hey, how was the ride in?  I left very early.  No, I mean not even that ride in.  I mean like just getting to this building.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  See, well, I left early just in case.  Is there government secrets in this building?  Dude.  For real?  It was like the first day of school in the new school. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  And I pulled up and I was on the wrong side of the building.  Yeah.  So I had to drive around.  And the parking lot guy, everything was arranged.  Yeah.  To switch my parking over from my old parking garage to the new one here at this building.  And they had no clue downstairs.  He's like, what?  What are you doing?  And I'm just like, no, I have a monthly.  He goes, no, you don't. 
[00:12:00]  Where's your paperwork?  I go, the guy was, I go, hold it.  Let me go.  So I called Kenny and he says, I'm sorry.  I'll be there in five minutes.  So I just went to the guy.  I go, just give me a ticket.  Just give me a ticket.  And keep it.  Yeah.  Keep the whatever he was in net.  And then Iraq pulls in in his truck.  And the guy goes, no, too big, too big.  Not his truck.  Him.  He goes, too, too big.  And Iraq goes, I have a monthly here.  He goes, no, you don't.  He goes, no, here's my stubs.  I've been coming here a week. 
[00:12:30]  What did the guy say then when Eric humiliated him with the facts?  Oh, he didn't care.  Oh, Kenny's back with the measurement.  Kenny, how many of your big cop flat feet?  The length of the hallway is 234 size 13 shoes.  Wow.  And is that to the conference room window?  So to the actual window, you're adding on another.  12.  Yeah.  He's, no, probably, yeah, 15 feet maybe.  So you're looking at almost a football field.  I'm exhausted.  That's 400 phone books. 
[00:13:00]  Let's make him do it with phone books now.  Yeah, that is a, wow.  I just want to welcome you guys and say best of luck.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenneth.  It's good to see that you made the cut.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm here temporarily.  He's here.  Who knows?  We'll see.  Yeah, we'll see.  All right.  My food's here.  We can do whatever we want.  We told him, look, we're just here to try this crap out.  That's true.  We got to work out the bugs.  It's weird watching TV over here. 
[00:13:30]  I'm used to seeing just Ope with nothing behind him.  It's like now I have to just kind of look like beyond you.  They didn't believe that you needed three TVs, by the way.  I had nothing to do with that.  No, I don't mind.  I don't care about the TV.  Give me guess two TVs.  I need three, and by the way, two of them have the same thing on.  Yes.  It's useless.  You have two TVs with Danny in the middle.  It's like Danny TV.  Well, we can't move in here.  Yeah, I don't mind that.  If you move, you're blocking somebody from something.  I can look at the two behind your head, and then if I want to look to my left or my right, 
[00:14:00]  I can see the third one.  But in the old studio, I couldn't see anywhere.  I'm the only one who's kind of used to this view, just the wall in the back.  Is that you, Jimmy?  Yeah.  You're like 400 yards, and Ant is like, oh, Ant, oh, Ant.  I know.  I'm rubbing Jim's leg right now.  Didn't we say we wanted a perfect triangle?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Perfectly symmetrized.  See, we learned that the perfect triangle between me and Jim is the way to go.  Yes, the triad.  Oh, are they going to hate us by 1030?  Oh, are they going to hate us?  By 1030, they're not used to this. 
[00:14:30]  Can I add something to the wish list?  Yes.  All right.  Can we get a toaster in the kitchen?  Oh, well, that's very important.  That's probably against code.  I don't know.  I got to toast GH's Pop-Tarts.  Oh, God.  Why don't you just get a magnifying glass and use the lights?  Yeah, actually, you can use the windows.  All the glass in the building, if you hold it up the right way, it fries it.  It is hot in this building.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it is hot.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Have you enjoyed the free soda yet?  I saw it.  I don't do free soda, though.  He's excited.  The kitchen has, like, free beverages.  Yeah, and they got, like, individual cups of coffee.  Coffee.  You know what?  You know what?  I didn't like the fact that Travis and Danny and Sam, all my pals, are in a whole other office.  They're way down the hall.  And I'm, no, like, we have an office next to them, but that's not my spot.  But we're not going to use that spot. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, but I can't hang out and, like, talk about, you know, hey, Lost, Travis.  Oh, I see.  Talk to Travis about Lost before the show and things like that.  No one can hang out.  We can't hang out with each other.  We're in different rooms.  No one can hang out.  One more person in either office and, you know, breaking some kind of fire code.  What I don't like is the fact that my iPhone is throwing 3G, and I'm trying to show a picture of you guys, like, to twit my view of open air.  I didn't even check this out yet.  Opie Radio already has pictures up of the news. 
[00:16:00]  But Opie Radio will never have a picture of Opie and Anthony from Jim Norton's view.  It's an impossibility.  It can't happen.  I got that.  Am I right or wrong, Dan?  All right, I do have a signal in here.  I have a signal.  Which is nice.  AT&T is fantastic.  We're fucking high enough up in the air.  What's below us?  The Chrysler building and the fucking Empire State Building?  We have connection to any shit and service we want, but I can't get internet.  The Chrysler building.  We are pretty fucking high up there.  Fucking ears popped in the elevator.  It's so irritating. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Let me see if I get...  Do I actually get?  It is getting really hot in here, right?  It's brutal.  Can we have a fan or something?  Well, we moved the fans because they were blowing all the bits around the studio.  We had actually...  I cut out a bunch of stuff, and then they turned on the AC, and I don't know, the bits went flying.  We're still trying to find them.  Yeah, that was hysterical.  And then Mars decided that this wasn't important, so he didn't...  He didn't like that story.  Why did you crumple up this important story? 
[00:17:00]  The Navy SEALs guys.  I said it was garbage.  Did you really?  He means creatively.  Oh, you got to give it to the Navy SEALs for, you know, knocking out those Somalian pirates.  Amazing.  I loved it.  Three headshots instantly, right?  Yeah, they just took those guys out.  You know, you get these goddamn European nations that just pay.  They pay money for these guys, and it keeps perpetuating the problem of these Somali pirates.  I hate that they're even pirates. 
[00:17:30]  Wasn't France doing a good job, though?  France was fucking really going after those guys.  He killed, like, 51 of them.  France was chasing some yacht around for a while, too, and then wound up getting one of the hostages killed,  but also killed a couple of the guys.  The SEALs just go in there and just...  Three shots, simultaneously taking out the three bad guys.  And there's the captain just sitting there going,  Captain's just saying, hey, all right, three exploding heads.  Wow.  This is fantastic. 
[00:18:00]  I think I'll leave now.  That's like a video game coming to life.  Isn't it?  That sounds like a really hard mission.  Yeah, that's a hard mission.  Really hard.  You got to get your guys...  Because you got to get your sniper rifle, and the waves are moving, and you got to, like, set that crap up.  And save the captain.  And then the captain's always slowing you down when you're trying to get back to the ship, and you got to protect them.  Right, right.  More Somalis come out, and you got to shoot them.  They're talking about a little strike on some Somalian docks now, too.  Because apparently, they don't take these little Zodiac boats out, these little inflatables, out from Somalia. 
[00:18:30]  They have, like, mother ships that bring them out 30 miles or so, and then they find a ship and kind of go at them.  So expect some massive bombings on the coast of Somalia to blow these ships up.  So I would like to think that we would do that.  People have been speculating it.  Yeah.  I had no idea that they had a mother ship.  I'm like, how are these dumb little boats getting way out in the shipping lanes? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I had no idea.  That's just it.  They have these other ships that go out, and people know it, but people have known about this for a while.  They're getting away with it.  People are paying, so they keep doing it.  If you're making two to four million bucks on a boatload of crap and people...  Sometimes a lot more.  Yeah.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  You know, you're going to keep doing it.  If you get your brains blown out by some Navy SEALs, perhaps if you see the American flag flying on the back of one of these ships, you'll think twice about it. 
[00:19:30]  I was watching the Situation Room last night.  The Situation Room.  It looks like that in here.  Yeah.  That Wolf Blitzer.  Oh, he's something all right.  He lives one long situation, that guy.  Oh, the screens must have been full of everything.  And they're saying that barbed wire would take care of the problem.  Really?  And the ships haven't really figured that out yet.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, to keep them from, like, boarding the vessel?  Yeah, just get a little barbed wire up and the situation would be solved.  Or put some butter on the handrail so they slip something and climb up. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, do some cartoon shit.  There's also a maritime law that these boats can't have guns on them.  You're not allowed to have guns on, like, civilian shipping boats.  Is it also an insurance thing, too, with the boats that have oil on them?  They're, like, an explosion or fuel tankers?  You're shooting into the, let's shoot into the side of the ship.  And I don't even know if a bullet would penetrate that.  But just, you would think, there would be, like, security who would be allowed to be armed.  Yeah.  And, you know, you see these things coming at you, just take some pot shots at them. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  That would sound the problem.  Now it's too cold in here.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  I know Jimmy and I are on the same page.  I went with long sleeves.  It's like being in a fucking van.  It's like in three minutes you feel the temperature everywhere in the room.  It's like being in a van with all that luxurious room.  I think I've got to be checked for cancer or something.  Why is my heat fluctuating?  Oh, my God.  It's freezing.  We had to turn the vents away from you earlier. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And you're still, yeah, it's still getting cold in here.  So the vents don't go flying around.  Yeah, we're fine-tuning the thermostat, I think.  Yeah.  Everything's being tuned today.  This is the tune-up show.  Yeah.  So far, so good.  And I see the Opie and Anthony logos on the glass outside.  That's kind of nice.  Oh, look at that.  I like that.  Kind of nice.  Yeah, I didn't even notice that.  That's the don't walk into this glass sign.  That is on everything around here.  I would love to see all the staff of this whole station without those things on here just crashing into windows like a parakeet loose in your house. 
[00:21:30]  He's just slamming into windows.  I never saw Blatter's glasses before.  Oh, really?  Have you seen them before?  No.  I don't know.  It's kind of creepy.  It's kind of creepy.  He's got the designer glasses.  They're all doing it.  What, the designer?  I guess.  The serial killer collection?  He has...  The Bausch and Lomba.  He has a pedophile's trial glasses.  You're going to notice a lot of designer glasses in this facility. 
[00:22:00]  Is that it?  Is that what we're looking at here?  The management walks around with their designer glasses.  Yeah.  Oh, wait till you see if you...  Oh, boy.  All right.  What else is going on?  There's a guy outside kind of confused looking around.  Like, who the fuck are these guys?  Got some plans under his arm.  Big doughy forearms.  Who is that guy?  Jimmy, what's over there?  There's a glass window you can see into. 
[00:22:30]  I can't see that.  Allegedly, Travis, but the way the lights are, now I can see him, but I can only see myself  and Danny in the reflection.  You've got to put another quarter in, and he'll jack off.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, the light's on.  Okay.  Maybe, because now the light's hurting poor Daniel.  We kind of wanted that glass removed, but they thought we were crazy, so why...  Why would we want to communicate with people in the room?  Why would they listen to us?  Easily.  They know how to do our radio show, I guess. 
[00:23:00]  Or at least have a way we could open the glass and talk.  Thank you.  Because I can't see anybody.  You know what would be good?  What?  Let us go into an empty room and design a studio for a show that we know nothing about so that  they can make fun of us.  Look at what they did!  Right.  How stupid is this?  Or just give us all their equipment, and we'll just, like, build us...  Yeah.  All right.  That's what you're saying.  And they would laugh at us.  No, but I'm trying to figure out, like, do their job, so...  You know what I mean? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Organize their office and their tools and their bins.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, exactly.  And then watch them go, what the fuck?  I wouldn't put this here.  Right.  But we would.  Right.  And that's all that matters.  One thing I do like is that, first of all, it feels fucking weird.  I feel like Luke Skywalker doing a show from the Death Star.  I know, that is true.  It feels kind of like fucking, you know, we shouldn't be here.  Yeah, yeah.  This was enemy territory for so many years.  Yeah, but it's a real beehive of activity.  It certainly is. 
[00:24:00]  There are people just trotting about, and I'm sure once the clock strikes nine...  Oh, forget it.  We will just see people waltzing through here, looking at us.  That's when the curtains have to be closed.  Oh, of course.  The last thing I need are people's noses pressed against the window.  We should only close the curtains when the people are looking in.  Like, as a gesture of, fuck you.  Like, if we see two or three faces peering in, we go out and we snoddyly close the curtains.  Snoddyly.  That would be such an insult. 
[00:24:30]  I love it.  How great would that be?  Especially if we beckon people over and then they're closed.  We just close the curtains.  Hoosh.  All right.  Oh, please, let's do that at least once today.  Oh, we have to.  Now that we have curtains outside...  Yeah.  We'll send somebody out.  We'll have a couple people at a peak.  We'll wave to them.  Whoosh them shut.  Yeah, I'm just going to close these.  You want to try a phone call?  Jimmy's going out to test how easily the curtains...  All right.  Whoosh.  Whoosh closed.  There he goes. 
[00:25:00]  And whoosh.  Yeah, leave him like that.  Leave him kind of hanging.  What are you doing, Jimmy?  I want him to stand there like he's a guest.  Like he's a guest.  Like he works here.  Make believe he's one of the bosses.  Somebody's looking and smiling.  And Jimmy goes...  Jimmy whooshed through the curtains closed right in his face.  Wow, is that satisfying?  That's good.  We are the best at...  Oh, I like that.  We're the best at visual bits on the radio, man.  That was a terrific one. 
[00:25:30]  Another one from the archive.  Oh, fantastic.  Want to try the phones?  Yeah, let's see how these work.  Well, Jason, you're the first call from the new studio.  Jason in Jersey.  Wow, a little trivia question for the future.  Congratulations on your new closet, gentlemen.  I just wanted to let you know the interaction is fantastic.  I have a Google Maps window open.  I'm staring at a picture of the building.  And Opie's Twitter picture.  So I can see what's going on inside the building.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  How does Opie have internet?  That's how big this fucking room is. 
[00:26:00]  She has it on one side, and I don't have it on the other side.  Fucking vast table.  Let's try a couple phone calls here.  Will in Florida.  What's up, Will?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  What is it?  All right, Will.  It's been a long time.  Lugga, lugga, you know.  Anyway, hey, like that, anyway.  Nonetheless, I got the name for the place.  That noise you heard was Opie clunking his coffee cup for Kenny to see.  Demanding.  Clunk, clunk, clunk. 
[00:26:30]  Demanding.  I love that.  What a sound.  Oh, is that annoying?  He spilled my coffee.  That's going to be the new sound every morning.  Oh, I can't wait until that shatters and spills scalding coffee in your lap.  Hey, wait.  If you want a bottle of water without interrupting the show, I can just go.  Cool.  I like that.  What do you got, Will?  Why don't we just drill a well in the middle of the console?  Hold on, Will.  Sorry.  We're all over the place.  Go ahead, Will.  Get your line out.  Oh, I got the name for the place. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I think Anthony is going to like this one.  Das Booth.  Das Booth.  Das Booth.  That's the first bomb of our tenure here.  We don't really have the replay set up yet, do we?  I guess we sort of do.  Wow, that could come down in an actual car crash in the middle of the console.  I can't get enough middle of the console jokes.  Please, there's a bevy.  Let's check again. 
[00:27:30]  There's so many jokes in the middle of the console.  If you wrote them out all on paper, you could fill the middle of the console.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You could set up another radio show in the middle of this console.  That might be what they're planning.  Right.  Save some space.  We should make Jimmy sit Indian style for the rest of the show.  In the middle?  Oh, that'd be great.  You know what's going to be happening?  This is why they did this.  I heard later Guinness is stopping by, and they're actually going to measure that and  photograph it.  Oh, boo.  We get it.  Big console.  I'm thinking Twitter opportunity, Jimmy. 
[00:28:00]  Indian style in the center of the console.  I can't get internet here.  You're going to be a Twitter star, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Why can't I get internet?  I don't think I can either.  Are you on the wireless network?  I don't know how to hook up to that.  I don't either.  No.  Oh, really?  Oh, by the way, Anthony, tonight is on, am I right?  Is tonight your Hannity?  Yes, tonight I am on Mr. Hannity's program, Sean Hannity.  I really, um...  Isn't that next door?  I really planned ahead, too.  Yeah.  I got a hotel room, like, 20 blocks away, and the Fox studio is right across the street. 
[00:28:30]  Actually, you don't even have to leave this building.  You can go underground and end up in the Fox studio, but I, um...  And you could have slept in the middle of the console.  Oh, another big console joke.  Until, uh, the big appearance on Hannity tonight.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah.  You want to take a break and figure...  You know, instead of console, they should call it a console.  You know, because it's spelled the same. 
[00:29:00]  Kind of like a B with a bunch of O's after it.  Yeah, we'll figure out if there's, um, internet.  Can I say, by the way, how fucking badly did we bomb on that last show at XM?  I was pondering that, and I had no clue what had happened.  We were doing great.  And then, uh, people just were sick of our shenanigans.  They'd had enough. 
[00:29:30]  They'd hit a wall.  They'd had enough of listening to us just going off about nonsense and making jokes that were making us laugh.  It was one bomb after another.  It was horrendous.  Carpet bombing.  Basically, like, go on vacation, dopes.  Yeah, yeah.  Saget left feeling like you needed a shower.  He was all frazzled.  Well, maybe because there was 500 people in the joints that last day.  All right.  Is this me?  It's hot in here now.  Yes.  I'm not kidding.  It is.  Now it's hot in here. 
[00:30:00]  The temperature changed in a second.  It's either a fucked up temperature gauge or we're all pregnant.  I'm going through the change.  Unbelievable.  We'll figure it out.  All right.  Wow.  You want to take a break?  Maybe talk a little vacation stuff?  Sure.  Boy, every time we go on vacation, a lot of people end up dying.  Yeah.  And this was going to be the first vacation where we came back and no one died while we were gone.  And, man, there was a trifecta overnight. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, overnight.  Pretty much overnight.  We got three down.  Do you know the three, Jimmy?  I know one of them, of course.  Of course you know the one.  I was very bummed about that.  Do you know the other two?  I do not.  Well, there's your tease, I guess.  There's your tease.  Your first tease.  First radio tease from the news studio.  Oh, my God.  It's broiling.  It's fucking...  And the space is so small that the change in temperature is immediate.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:31:00]  Why don't we make a lesson on the Picasso?  Oh, it's hot enough now.  Kenny, toast my freaking Pop-Tarts.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  Yeah, let's do that.  We don't even know if we can go to break.  That was another thing we weren't sure was going to happen today.  Oh, yeah.  These guys were working on the studio literally until 6 o'clock.  Right, Mars?  Yes.  Mars?  Look at Mars in the room.  Yes, I made it.  Well, we don't know for how long, though.  Well, you know.  Mars made the cut for now.  One day at a time, as they say.  Oh, yeah, that's right. 
[00:31:30]  Let me show you my ID card.  Let me see.  I got an ID card.  Fucking Blatter signed a piece of notebook paper.  It's yellow like the interns.  Oh, gee.  No.  That's not a good sign.  Oh, no.  That means Mars is a coward.  That's great.  That's like the one they gave Starling in...  You sent a trainee to me?  We should fucking treat him the way fucking Migs did.  It's got an expiration date on it. 
[00:32:00]  A couple of days.  That's all you need.  Oh, this is very good news coming in from Jeremy in Cleveland before the break.  Jeremy.  Well, it's nice to see that SiriusXM gave you a bleachers area for your audience in the middle of the council.  Oh, there you go.  Well, we could probably fit 20 of you.  Welcome back, guys.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Audience in the round.  We should just make them come in and stand right there.  One person at a time.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break, hopefully, if this works.  And then we'll tell you who died, just three of them. 
[00:32:30]  Get into some vacation stories, maybe.  And other things.  Opie and Anthony from the new freaking studio at SiriusXM.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Live from the new studio at SiriusXM.  Satellite.  Radio.  I just realized something else. 
[00:33:00]  We're in a glass building.  Yeah.  A million windows.  Yeah.  We can't see outside.  No, we can't see outside.  I used to like the sun coming in.  That is true.  When the sun started coming up and bouncing off the buildings, I kind of like that.  We had windows at both the CBS and the XM facility.  We had a window looking out.  And if you want to go back, NEW, we had a window.  Oh, yeah.  With all the showers.  Now we can't look at, like, part of the thing also is looking at nude. 
[00:33:30]  Sorry.  Nudity.  Mullet alert.  Sorry, Jeff Foxworth, he just walked by.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, they're going to hate us by tomorrow.  Jesus, we'll come back the other way.  Where did someone get a little incest around here?  That guy so wanted to just check out our studio.  He made believe there was something going on over there. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  This is so distracting.  She probably works for it.  I guarantee you she works for the shade.  She probably works for the place I grew up.  It's the first day.  Let's try to be a business child molester.  Why don't we get to know people?  Who is this guy?  Hold on.  Grab that guy.  Yeah, why don't we have a mic outside?  If all these people are going to, like, casually walk by and make believe there's business down here.  There's no business on this side of the floor.  Is there now?  We are tucked away. 
[00:34:30]  Who's this guy?  Joe Rogan's little brother.  Let's talk to this guy.  Get a mic outside.  We're going to, like, stop everyone that's walking by.  We're trying to get to know our new neighbors.  We have no mic, though.  Hold on, guys.  How embarrassed.  I wonder what that says.  What's it say?  Oh, it's police.  Hard to note, yeah.  All right, we're going to get a mic outside, so.  Yes.  Okay.  Of course they can hear us.  Steve's helping out.  He goes, you know they can hear you, right?  Because he knows what a pussy I am. 
[00:35:00]  They can hear you.  I'll continue.  No problem.  We'll stop everyone going through here and asking them, who's this kid?  Oh, it's Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Sam's fucking, the way he's walking, he looks like an older woman now with his hips, so he  has a hip injury.  Yeah.  Wow, look at the intern.  Jesus.  I like the fucking, I like the sweatshirt hanging on the shoulder, yeah.  What a rack.  A little ample.  Yeah.  She's looking ample today.  The thing about Sam now also, Sam, over at XM, we watched the transformation of your 
[00:35:30]  hair from a very close, tight, curly hair thing.  Yeah.  To the big afro that took so long to grow out, and now to this double bubble ponytail  poof thing that you got going.  Right.  So we know what it looked like and what it potentially could look like if you cut it and everything.  Do you realize these people have no idea, they just think you look like a freak? 
[00:36:00]  Iraq said somebody stopped in the office like last week when I was not here and goes, hey,  who's that guy walking around with the afro ponytail?  Does he work for you?  The afro ponytail.  You're the afro ponytail guy.  I'm making a lot of friends thanks to it.  You're representing Captain Hook's restroom.  Sam, set up shop outside the studio with a microphone and stop everybody that is walking  through the area.  Ask them their name, what they do here, and when they expect to be fired. 
[00:36:30]  Those are the questions?  Yeah.  Mars, find me an ethernet.  Yes.  I'm an ethernet.  All right.  Thanks.  You're a good man.  So we'll set up Sam outside studio.  There you go.  Our first bit.  It's a terrific one, isn't it?  It's fantastic.  So the trifecta of people that died pretty much overnight or in the last 36 hours.  How did it happen?  And one of them happened in Northboro.  Speaking of that voice, Ant.  Yeah?  Northboro.  I remember Northboro. 
[00:37:00]  We used to broadcast from Westboro.  Westboro.  And Northboro was pretty much a little north and east of Westboro.  I think.  My compass is correct.  Yeah.  Three guys.  Well, we'll start with the Northboro guy.  Yeah.  Anyone remember Mark Fidrich?  Mark, the pitcher, the bird.  He was a pitcher for the Orioles.  He's dead.  54, I believe.  He used to talk to the fucking ball.  He'd bounce the ball in his hand and talk to it, right? 
[00:37:30]  He was a really blacked out dude.  He was a lunatic.  He used to pat the mound.  He played for the Tigers.  He had one of the best rookie seasons ever.  I think he went 19-9.  He was a sensation, right?  Yeah, sensation went 19-9.  And then, his career stats after his first year, he only went 29-19 on his career.  That was it.  Wow.  Lasted five years, sort of, and then he was out of baseball.  What, did he have injuries?  He had an injury, and yeah, he got so fucked with his career.  What, did he have spina bifida? 
[00:38:00]  How the fuck?  How do you go from 19-9 to 20-29?  In his rookie year, he was taking steroids, and then he stopped.  He went 10-10 for the rest of his career, which was over about four seasons.  He was pretty much done after his first year.  Wow.  Pretty much done.  Came out of nowhere.  He was a sensation, 19-9, and then out of baseball literally three or four years later.  What year was that, like 79?  Something like that.  And then he tried to make a comeback with the Red Sox, I believe, in 82 or 83. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  And it didn't work out for him.  And so, he was a dump truck operator.  He's hanging out in North Borough.  Oh, boy.  And they needed his truck for some asphalt, because it's that time of year.  Yeah.  Filling the potholes, and they call up Mark Fidrich.  Jesus, what the fuck happened to this poor guy?  Wow, that's a...  And he was working on his truck that had about 10 wheels.  Mm-hmm.  And they kind of found him under his truck.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean?  He was fixing it?  Yeah.  And it rolled over him?  Something happened.  Or he had a heart attack?  I don't think he had a heart attack. 
[00:39:00]  I think the injury had something to do with him and his dump truck.  Was it under?  Fidrich, I know some guys have gotten, which is the worst, where they put the dump truck  up, and then they get in there without blocking it, and the hydraulics kind of fail, and the  whole bed of the dump truck comes down on top of you.  Maybe that's what happened.  Zoinks.  That'll hurt.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So we lost Mark Fidrich.  Mark Fidrich.  Some people would remember him.  And then Jimmy's got probably the info on the next one. 
[00:39:30]  We all know her.  I don't know what...  We don't know how she died, but we're talking about Marilyn Chambers.  Yep.  56 years old.  She's the one that...  Behind the green door.  But she's the one that made porn acceptable to the average person, right?  Yeah, she was...  Before her, it was always very naughty, naughty.  One of the first big names in porn.  Yeah, I think she did the first interracial scene in Behind the Green Door.  Yikes.  And I met her many years ago. 
[00:40:00]  I got a picture of her when I was, like, 19.  Yeah.  Frank's Chicken House in New Jersey.  Really?  Yeah.  She was very sexy.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  This is from Behind the Green Door, right?  Of course it is.  They used to know how to do the porn music.  What went on Behind the Green Door?  I remember the trailer for this was, like, one of those that sounded like that 70s guy.  Of course, because it was the 70s dummy.  She was a, uh, she fucking did Irish, she was the Irish snow model, and then, um, I think 
[00:40:30]  she did Behind the Green Door, and I'm reading the papers that sparked a buying frenzy of  Irish snow boxes.  First movie?  Yeah.  Of course, Procter & Gamble dropped her.  And then she looked like she was covered in ivory liquid, which is kind of a coincidence.  You know her first movie?  Behind the Green Door, I think.  Nope.  No?  Small part in a little Barbra Streisand picture.  Oh, yeah.  What, did she play her nose in a movie?  What was that one she did, uh, with Owl in the title?  Oh, the Owl and the Pussycats. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I believe she had a smaller role.  She had a pussy?  Yeah, she did.  Wah, wah, wah.  That's not her place.  Hack.  And what happened?  Her son or something?  I think her son or daughter found her?  I don't know.  Just dead in her house?  Yeah.  I don't know why yet?  She was sexy, man.  She was, I met her, I'm 40 now, so that's like 20 years ago, 21 years ago.  And I remember getting a picture with her, and she kind of like half sat on my lap, and  she had just big fucking heavy tits.  Yeah.  Big juicy rump.  Oh, is she sexy? 
[00:41:30]  Big natural heavy K-parker tits.  I remember there was something I didn't like about her.  It might have been her...  Vagina part?  Yeah.  It might have been that.  The icky vagina part?  You know, you make jokes, but I think there was something weird with it.  Really?  Yeah, like she might have had a lot of roast beef or something.  I think her boobs moved out to the sides too much.  Something like that?  I think this one went right.  Why don't we get a nude shot of her so we can review?  Are we allowed to do that from this government institution we're broadcasting from? 
[00:42:00]  I know.  It doesn't feel like that.  Hey, Sam, you got an actual mic?  I mean, we're going to turn your mic on when people, like, walk by the studio.  Yeah, we're, uh...  Because we got a lot of, uh, looky-loos.  We're sending some interns back to the old office because they don't have any long cables here.  Oh, all right.  What's the old office?  Like, what?  Like, some studio.  Like, what?  The other place is still...  They don't have long quarter-inch cables nor long XLR cables.  What's going on at that other place?  Is there still a mic and a console? 
[00:42:30]  And there's still a buddy in there.  Oh, great.  Is he still buddy?  Is he still there?  Yes, he's still from the mic.  It's like the apocalypse.  That motherfucker won in the end.  Dude, he put up a fight for the refrigerator.  Yeah.  Wow, he did win.  He officially won.  Last man standing.  We were trying to get him out of there.  He got us out of there.  He won.  Last man standing.  When's he leaving there?  That's it, huh?  Supposedly the end of this month.  Oh, that's kind of sad.  Well, let me see.  The picture.  Is that our studio just ripped apart?  That's our old studio just completely... 
[00:43:00]  It's just a giant console left.  Oh, my God.  Seems to be the...  Oh, look at her.  Oh, wow.  There's Marilyn Chambers.  Where?  She's taking it.  Get your magnifying.  She's got a nice fucking body, man.  She's taking it.  Yeah.  You know, pure girl.  She's getting deep dicked.  How great is that?  Fantastic.  Good deep digging.  Yeah, so that studio's just been like scavenged.  They scavenged everything from over there.  And now it doesn't work.  It's gone.  It's gone.  We actually took pieces of the other frames, the clocks frames and all that, to finish this up. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah?  Nice.  Very good.  So what about Ron and Fez?  Were they from in here?  Ron and Fez will be in here from noon to three.  All right.  You got to see where they are.  Let me explain where Ron and Fez are for the Ron and Fez fans.  Oh, no.  We're on like the 30-something floor up here.  We're way up.  Way up.  And we have office space that's probably, what, 50 yards down that long, long hallway? 
[00:44:00]  About 50-yard sprint.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Ron and Fez are on the 19th floor.  Yeah.  Pretty close to 20 floors below us.  Uh-huh.  Here's the problem with Ron and Fez.  Not only are they 20 floors below this studio.  That's pretty convenient, right?  They actually have to go all the way down to the lobby, down to floor number uno.  One.  And then move to another elevator bank to go up to the 19th floor where their offices are. 
[00:44:30]  From their office.  So when they want to go from their office to this studio, they got to go all the way down  to the lobby, walk across the lobby to another elevator bank up to where we are every day.  And this seemed like a show that's pretty dependent on their office being close to the...  Oh, Fez, he was here yesterday, just freaking me out.  He had to have been.  Oh, God.  He was just staring at the engineers as they were trying to put this thing together last night.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, so the third person that died. 
[00:45:00]  So we got Marilyn Chambers.  I didn't know Mark Fidrich.  Mark Fidrich, the bird.  And, well, let me play the audio.  This guy.  The 0-2 pitch.  Swing and a mess.  Stuck him out.  Oh, my God.  A-Rod in the playoffs.  Died.  The Phillies are 2008 World Champions of Baseball.  We got a lot of Philly listeners.  That's Harry Callis.  Oh, okay.  He is dead.  How old was he?  The Phillies announcer. 
[00:45:30]  And supposedly, I need a little help on this.  I don't know.  They said it was unexpected, but the picture in the paper, I'm like, unexpected?  Really?  It looks expected.  Really?  Unexpected?  Did the picture look very expected?  Yes.  It was just a matter of time.  But supposedly, he was found dead in the broadcast booth getting ready for a game?  Wow.  You know, he went out doing what he loved to do.  I guess God needed a baseball announcer.  Really?  Yeah.  He's up there clutching his chest or whatever the hell happened with no one around. 
[00:46:00]  That's how he wanted to go out.  He died doing what he loved.  He was struggling for breath in front of a microphone that's not on.  Right.  Oh, my gosh.  Right.  But a legendary broadcast.  Danny, is that true, though?  They found him in the broadcast booth getting ready for a game?  That is correct.  That is correct, sir.  Oh, there he is.  All right.  Well, he's using a little Grecian formula on top, it looks like.  Yeah, but he's a legend.  And he is the third guy or the third person that dropped.  Notice these mics pick up even when you're far away. 
[00:46:30]  I've been noticing that.  Huh?  You don't really got to get up.  You could use the one fist rule.  David's not here yet?  I saw him wandering around, making believe he had something important to do.  Oh, God.  Are they going to make fun of him around here?  Yeah.  David is not here today.  He's here tomorrow.  Oh.  What was he doing all day yesterday on those?  There's a bank of computers.  Those are interns' workstations.  Really?  What does that mean?  It's a computer, personal computer, that the intern uses to do work. 
[00:47:00]  What does an intern do if they need anything?  They check their Facebooks.  Yeah, they check their Facebooks and grab food.  You can't get food from a computer.  You know that paper with all the sports scores that you have on it?  Oh, yeah.  Those don't stop.  They don't do themselves.  Right.  The thing I throw away?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  That's why the interns do it.  They do.  Yeah.  Fantastical.  Oh, look at that.  We found a cord there long enough, huh?  Yes, we got it.  Yeah, it's great. 
[00:47:30]  What do you want to ask him, Sam?  Well, I thought the line of questioning was, what's your name?  What do you do here?  When are you getting fired?  Well, maybe not the last thing of shit.  Maybe.  Well, we got a lot of love.  We got a lot of people walking by, checking the scene out.  Yeah.  You know, this is how they let them know that we were coming today.  They all got something in their email.  It said, scumbag alert.  Yeah.  The assholes are here.  And then, you know, and it's relatively early. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, you wait.  Is this, does this get crazy?  Because this is my first day here.  You guys, being the city dwellers that you are, well, poor Danny, you guys were here already.  Many times.  Checking this stuff out.  Well, it should be noted that we got a nice, fine vacation.  And these guys had to come in every day last week.  Oh, I know.  To do absolutely nothing.  I just, because they had a, they had a, it wasn't nothing.  I successfully changed my desktop background. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, right.  My computer.  What'd you use?  Uh, Eraserhead baby face.  Oh, God, it's creepy.  Yeah, it's very creepy.  I can't wait to see it.  And, uh, yeah, they had to come in.  And you guys came in to check things out.  Oh, that is so goddamn creepy, Eraserhead baby.  Um, uh, but I, I did not.  So this is my first day here in the new school.  You've never seen it?  No.  This is like the first day at school.  And, and I'm, I'm seeing new people are going to be coming in. 
[00:49:00]  But are there a lot of people here in the?  That's, that's going to be a very busy hallway in another 45 minutes.  Yeah.  So this bit will work.  Because, uh, my peripherals, I probably get very distracted.  Is the hip hop guys here yet?  Are we going to say hi to them?  Yo.  Is this working?  I don't know if that's working.  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  No, it's not working.  First, why would it work?  Which way, Mike?  Mike Six.  Uh, well, uh, okay.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, baby.  Now?  Yes.  There we go.  But why did he take it off Mike? 
[00:49:30]  All right, whatever.  Two types of ones.  That's fine.  The, uh, the shady, uh, Shade 45 station starts at 8 o'clock.  Their morning show starts.  Well, of course they do.  That's it.  That's it.  Wow.  Oh, damn.  Oh, no.  Well, it's not like their listening audience has to.  Well, all right.  All right.  Oh, God.  What's going on in there now?  Nothing.  Music?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They get to start their morning show at 8?  Yes.  That's like, that's the dream schedule right there.  Dude. 
[00:50:00]  What?  I know.  I mean.  We all.  Yeah.  Yes, Mars.  In their defense, they were here until about 11 last night.  Doing what?  I don't know.  Caught in, yo.  At the wedding show, people?  Well, 345.  What do you think?  It's two guys that just run the whole fucking thing all day?  Eminem and Fiddy come in every day.  It's those two.  So we got them.  And now what's going on with the other station?  Well, there's...  That's to the...  Then we got the Gay Channel, next to the hip-hop.  But then we got...  Right behind...  Who's in there? 
[00:50:30]  Martha Stewart.  Oh.  Oh, is that Stewart?  I thought that was Cousin Brucie.  No.  Do they look the same?  Let's try to make contact with the other shows.  Oh, no.  Morse Code.  Where's Martha?  Is she here?  See if anyone...  Yeah, right.  Let's get her in to welcome us.  She works two hours a month.  She brings some cupcakes for us or something.  She just baked.  Tell that bitch to whip something up for us to eat.  And then who's over here?  Behind Anthony. 
[00:51:00]  Over here now.  He has a production studio.  Yeah, that's a production.  So that's our little corner.  We got the hip-hop.  Now, what happens with the Gay Channel?  We got the Gay.  Are they doing a show?  OutQ?  Yeah, they have a morning show.  They also have curtains on their window.  Do they?  Are they closed?  No.  Their curtains are better than ours.  They got nice window treatments.  We got sheets up. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  So what are you going to do?  What should I ask them if I can't ask them when they're being fired?  Why can't you ask them that?  Oh, you guys reacted in this.  Oh.  All right.  Well, then I will.  How about do you anticipate being fired or do you think when?  What's the bigger douchebag vote?  Yeah, we'll figure out better questions.  Yeah, or a better way of putting it.  Are you going to miss this place when you're fired?  Yes, eh?  How about this is a big salary show.  Are you going to miss this place when you're fired to make room under the cap? 
[00:52:00]  These are expensive talent.  Oh, my God.  I got the first bit for tomorrow.  Does it involve gas in a match at the front door?  We are going to do some bowling down that hall tomorrow.  With a bowling ball?  For real.  Because those are glass walls.  Yeah.  For real.  People in glass buildings should not bowl.  Is it safe to say? 
[00:52:30]  I think that's a saying.  Oh, boo is another one.  Yeah, saying fine.  If it's a joke, it's in trouble.  Safe to say that says as long as a bowling alley?  It's even longer, right?  It's crazy.  That's a lot longer than a bowling alley.  All right.  Kenny has to find some bowling pins and a bowling ball.  Is there like a bouncy bounce bowling ball?  We could use like a kickball or something.  Oh, yeah.  You want to do it that way so we don't lay the thing right through the window?  Trying to be a little smarter. 
[00:53:00]  On our second day.  It's all glass all the way down the right side.  Yeah, that gutter ball could really hurt.  How much trouble would we get in if tomorrow we came in with a fucking mallet and bashed  every window?  I would say fired.  We should do some of that subway.  What is it called?  Scratchiti.  Scratchiti.  It's graffiti on the windows and they scratch their...  Let's do some Scratchiti.  Sam knows all about that.  What do you know on Scratchiti?  Of course.  We'll all have tags. 
[00:53:30]  Okay.  And we'll just tag off every window here.  What's the base?  I'll be crossing your tags out and disrespecting you, y'all.  What?  Oh, try it.  Watch it.  Try it.  What are your tags, though?  Yeah.  My tag?  F-A-what?  You ever tag Sam?  Yes.  Yeah?  It's just not Sam.  It's Sam.  Okay, here's what it is.  It's Sam, but there's a line over it.  So like in math, when you put a line over something, it means not this. 
[00:54:00]  Ah.  So, right?  It's not Sam, but you don't spell it.  And how about a line through it?  No.  When you're disrespected, yo.  Oh, don't disrespect me.  My turf.  It's my turf, too.  I watch those gang shows on A&E and things like that.  God, it's just so ridiculous.  And this tag right here has a line through it, and you see it has another tag here, and  that means it's a whole thing, which means, you know, someone's dying.  Someone's getting killed for spray painting over somebody's spray paint. 
[00:54:30]  It's obvious to, what, 10 people?  Yeah.  And the rest of us are like, my little kid could do better than that.  Yeah, and if some kid decides, you know, I'm just going to spray paint over this.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I saw that kid.  He was doing something.  Yeah, okay, shoot him.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  By the way, good news.  Wow.  Plan would halt yapping cabbies.  They're going to put something in the front seat so they can't yap on their cell phones,  but in the back, you can talk on yours.  Because I hate when you get in a cab and they start, and I always go, excuse me? 
[00:55:00]  And they don't even acknowledge, they just keep, and they're talking into, you know,  They talk the entire shift now to their families back home or wherever the fuck.  Oh, they're planning things is what that's all about.  Whole network going on.  Good.  I love it.  And now they're talking about to ensure, like, only authorized people can drive cabs.  They might use some kind of an iris scan or biometrics, like fingerprint thing.  Ooh, the future.  Yeah, the future.  Good.  When I was on vacation, I got in a cab. 
[00:55:30]  It was the karaoke cab driver.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Ew.  And so the rest of my vacation, I asked every other cab driver if they liked the karaoke  cab driver.  They hate him.  They fucking hate him.  And they all know him, because it's just one idiot.  And what does he do?  Oh, that was an interesting little popping sound.  Well, what was the, what does he do?  We got in, and he had Beyonce cranking on a screen that was, like, this monitor, like 
[00:56:00]  a basic computer monitor, I guess, just cranking a Beyonce video.  He goes, I'm the karaoke cab driver.  Would you like to sing a song before you get to your destination?  And we're like, no.  Oh, that's what I was getting at.  Is it the passenger that's supposed to sing, or is he singing?  Well, the screen is pretty.  Is there a mic?  Look, the screen was pretty much right in front of him.  And then, you know, you're in the back seat, so, like, everyone's been in the minivans  with the other TV in the back.  So then it's right there in front of you as well.  We didn't get to the point where there might be words on the screen where you sing along. 
[00:56:30]  I don't think there's mics.  No, I mean.  And where was this?  In the Cayman Islands.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You don't need a mic because you're in the cab, so you just sing, I guess.  Yeah, but, you know, you want to belt it out.  You need a mic in front of you.  But that became our bit every time we got in a cab.  Do you know the karaoke cab driver?  Yes.  Why?  Do you like him?  No.  We hate him.  He's an ass.  We all hate him in his stupid bit.  The Cayman Islands. 
[00:57:00]  I wonder if that's the same taxi that Gene Hackman took when he was hiding.  Oh, right.  In that movie.  The worst music ever in a movie, The Firm.  Oh, I've never seen that.  Tom Cruise and The Firm.  I remember that.  Read the book, loved it, and that was the last book I loved by that idiot.  I'm so sick of that fucking John Grisham.  Enough.  Lawyer makes good.  Drop dead.  Bore.  He wrote the same book ten times.  It's fucking awful.  Fucking idiot.  But you know music is bad when you recognize it in a movie.  And the two movies that had music that was unbearable was Justice for All with Pacino and The Firm. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  What was bad about the music and The Firm?  It was just, I don't know.  None of it worked.  Was it the band, The Firm?  Yeah, that would be pretty bad.  Scott Face is really bad, though, too.  It's just horrid music.  That was bad, yeah.  Yeah.  And then the 80s techno pop or wherever the hell it was.  Imagine the band, The Firm, is sitting at home hoping to get the call to do the music for the movie, The Firm. 
[00:58:00]  And they don't.  And they don't.  Like, fuck me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I was just reading something.  What happened?  No, I got different web pages popping up over here.  I noticed what we have to do is turn the power saver modes off of these monitors.  Because how many times has your phone monitor gone black?  It keeps going black.  Yeah.  Is anyone even screening the calls?  There's just weird numbers up there. 
[00:58:30]  And it's not their phone numbers.  Like, what do these people want to talk about?  Ew, what is that?  Yeah, look at that.  Some kind of weird code.  Oh, that's weird.  I've never seen that before.  All right, write that down.  We've got to figure that out, too.  It's showing, like, a phone number, but all three lines have the same number.  As we go.  Scary.  And that shitty fucking station in Boston that wasn't going to air Leno's 10 o'clock show,  they're going to air a local news show. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, that guy went off about how the local news is more important.  And they buckled.  NBC really threw their weight around.  Good.  I want to see Jay on it.  It's Jay's hometown.  And they weren't going to air him live.  It's an affiliate.  It's like NBC can turn around and probably did tell him, okay, you fill 24 hours with your local shit.  Let's see what happens.  We've run in three Stooges episodes in prime time.  Right.  Dummy.  Asshole.  So he's also, when is that happening?  I think Conan takes over.  I want to say June 1st, and then Leno probably in September.  I think Leno has time off. 
[00:59:30]  I'm reading this in the paper.  There's an article in GQ or something about an interview, and he's talking about how he regrets the problems that him and Letterman had.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Probably a very good interview.  We can't go to the phones.  We had the Billy Bob Thornton thing that happened over a break, which is pretty amazing.  He's a complete douchebag.  Is he?  He's one of these actors that is doing the band thing, and so he's being interviewed about the band thing.  So obviously the people are like, well, we want to talk about all the things. 
[01:00:00]  Talk to you about.  And he refused to answer any other questions except for, yes, Sam.  Well, he wasn't even, they didn't even try to ask him just because they said things like, you know him as an actor, but his first love is actually music.  Right.  And apparently he was offended by that.  Billy Bob's a fucking, I thought that was a phony interview because the guy, the Canadian, the guy from Montreal was actually giving a very good interview.  Yeah.  Like he was giving a real interview, he was talking about the music, he was talking to all band members, the other three snarky looking douchebags as well as Billy Bob. 
[01:00:30]  They look like Billy Bob friends, three fucking guys that probably don't need the glasses they're wearing, they're probably not even prescription.  They're like this fucking Lens Crafter, I look smarter in these glasses.  And that phony boar.  You weren't listening earlier.  You're going to see a lot of those glasses in about 40 minutes.  Those are fucking, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's, Sam, that's another thing you got to do is count the designer glasses that these, uh, these douches wear around here.  Okay.  Not by lenses.  Or count by lenses and divide by two. 
[01:01:00]  Right, right.  Unless Sandy Duncan's here.  Yeah, count the pairs.  Count the pair.  Right.  Very good.  So I think that, uh, I thought it was phony.  I'm like, Billy Bob couldn't be this much of a deluded douche.  He's got to be doing the fucking stupid, uh, whatever his name is, uh, Joaquin, uh, Joaquin Phoenix.  Yeah, yeah, Joaquin Phoenix doing his, uh.  Ugh.  His phony, I'm going crazy.  So avant-garde.  He's interesting.  Yeah.  He's interesting.  How about this?  How about you just point at your fucking cleft lip nose and let people giggle? 
[01:01:30]  How about that, Joaquin?  Stop trying to be dark and mysterious.  You're not.  No one gives it.  Well, is he cracking up?  What's going on with this guy?  He's in a bad spot because now he realizes everyone's onto him.  So now how is he going to spin it?  Because he'll have some kind of weird spin to it now.  You're not Borat.  No.  He'll spin it by making another lousy movie.  Well, he is without the at.  Fucking awful.  And Billy Bob's interview, it was like he was trying too hard.  He gave the same answer, like, the first answer he gave was like, well, I don't know what you mean by that. 
[01:02:00]  It's like, yes, you do.  You do, unless you're fucking retarded.  Unless you really are Carl from Sling Blade, you asshole.  Why don't we play a couple clips from this?  Because a lot of people haven't heard it yet.  Okay.  Yeah.  My guitar is Bill Cox.  Members of the Boxmasters, Billy Bob Thornton, J.D. Andrew, Mike Butler, and Danny Baker here in Studio Q.  Hello, boys.  Hey, how's it going?  Good to have you here.  Three albums in the past year? 
[01:02:30]  What?  That seems ambitious.  That's the ones that have been released.  Yeah, we've recorded about five.  There's more.  I mean, you guys formed, Billy Bob, you guys formed only in the last couple of years, right?  I don't know what you're talking about.  How so?  I don't know what you mean by that.  Well, when did the band form?  I'm not sure what that means.  Oh, well, when did you guys first start playing together? 
[01:03:00]  We started about two years ago.  What a dick.  What is he doing?  It's fucking phony.  Have you done shows before this run?  It's phony.  It's put on.  Of course.  I don't know what you're...  Really?  When did the band form?  What don't you know about that?  That's a dumb place to try to put in some wacky answer.  He's one of these fucking...  He's just a fucking trying to make his band bigger and be intriguing, and the music probably stinks.  I'm still confused by this.  So you think he's just putting this on for the hell of it, or is he really pissed off and now he's decided to be difficult? 
[01:03:30]  No, I think he's putting it on because the next...  There's another question the guy asks where he goes,  I don't know what you mean by that.  And the guy kind of laughs or something, and then he switches tactics, and he's just trying to be like this obscure guy.  Listen to it a little bit more.  The next question, I think he does the same bullshit.  Like he doesn't know what he means.  Really?  Are you that confused, Billy Bob?  Are you?  Have you done shows before this run with Willie Nelson before?  Yeah, we did a run last November and December for a few weeks with Willie in the States. 
[01:04:00]  What do you learn from Willie Nelson, Billy Bob?  I've never met him.  Are you being ironic, or are you being serious?  I don't really know him.  You don't...  You've never met Willie Nelson?  Well, I said hello to him once.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  You guys don't really hang out on tour.  Um...  I don't know.  You don't know what I mean.  No.  Why do I get the impression that you're going to answer with that? 
[01:04:30]  You don't know what I mean if I ask you a thing.  So how is it that you guys...  Did Willie choose you guys to come on tour?  Poor bastard.  I don't know.  Right.  See?  Um, all right.  He's a yishbag.  We would have handled that differently.  Without a doubt.  Because the guy's giving him a real interview.  He's asking about the tour.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  And Billy Bob's just a fucking baby.  What a baby.  So he's just...  I'm still confused.  Did this guy piss...  You're not...  He didn't piss him off.  No, that was the beginning of the interview.  He just decided to do kind of a Joaquin Phoenix thing.  Yeah, I think he did. 
[01:05:00]  It seems to me...  It seems really phony to me.  Mm-hmm.  Because the guy did nothing to justify a douchebag attitude.  Right.  The rest of the band were bores, too.  Ooh.  Self-important fucking bores.  Hears.  The guy was upbeat.  He was being nice to them.  And I never heard of him.  No one gives a shit about their music.  And this guy's giving them a real interview.  Only because Billy Bob's in the band.  That's the only reason.  I say we hear a little.  Huh?  Do we have any?  Yeah.  Any Billy Bob music?  Yeah, Travis is raising his finger.  I just want to hear what this crap sounds like. 
[01:05:30]  I'm sure it's like...  Well, let's...  We'll play another track from the interview as they find that.  Travis has it?  Travis has it.  Oh, all right.  I can't see him.  I know.  It's weird.  We need mirrors.  So you can look at, like, three reflections.  You hold up a mirror to Jimmy and I'll...  Yeah.  I know it would be this.  What year is this?  I can tell my story about 20 times with $2 in the juice box. 
[01:06:00]  One dime at a time.  A dime at a time.  Oh.  Wow.  You know what?  For what it is, it's not bad.  Yeah, shit.  For shit, it's not bad.  I mean, none of us would buy this or download it or any of that crap.  It's old school country.  Yeah, it's that twangy country crap.  It's country that was popular in the 50s and 60s.  Is that making a comeback, you think? 
[01:06:30]  No.  His vocals sound a bit like Warren Zevon, too.  Anyone hearing that?  The music is fine.  The music's fine, but his vocals, if he wasn't who he was, they would have got a better singer.  I wish his vocals sounded like Warren Zevon now.  Ooh.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  His inspiration.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Play through it.  The best beat ever.  That drum fills.  It's terrible.  You've got to play through it. 
[01:07:30]  You've got to play through it.  We have to have that as one of our music bands, officially.  I reckon I do.  We have to come back from break with that every once in a while.  I'm going to give the first instant feedback to Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Wow.  As well he should.  Yeah.  We should give him a little, uh, little, uh, little, uh, little, uh, well, now I lost  his feedback.  So he'll get nothing and like it.  Uh, Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, the interviewer should have just said, get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out, you big retard.  Or the Billy Bob Thornton non-interview. 
[01:08:00]  And that was true for you, Billy Bob, growing up.  It was a, sort of a combo of Stones and Monkeys and, and Buck Owens.  I just liked baseball when I was a kid.  And you almost became a professional baseball player, right?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Um, but you, you didn't love music when you were a kid?  Um, I, I subscribed to a magazine called, um, Famous Monsters of Filmland, which, uh, 
[01:08:30]  the publisher was a guy named Forrest J. Ackerman who passed away recently.  Yeah, he's pulling.  It's phony.  It's fucking bullshit.  It's so fake.  What would nonsense?  Wow, he's different.  We're getting more info on this and, and actually he's going to explain why he's upset in the  next track.  Oh.  Hmm.  Do you remember what you were, you were listening to musically when you were a kid?  Well, they had a contest where you could build your own model and it could be like a King 
[01:09:00]  Kong or it could be, uh, it could be anything from something that you created yourself to  like one of the monsters that was actually in the, uh, well, you know, in, in some of the,  uh, the, the, the magazines, like, uh, for, it could be Frankenstein all the way to Phantom  of the Opera.  Yeah.  So that's, uh, you know, now finally we're going to get into why he was doing what he was  doing.  But does anybody smell how fucking phony and put on like, wow, he's, he's, what's  he talking about? 
[01:09:30]  He's out there.  He lost it on a talk show.  Did you hear?  Did you hear?  The guy said, what kind of music did you listen to as a kid?  What influences did you have?  They're perfectly legitimate questions.  Of course.  And this asshole is acting like he's so spaced out, man.  He's reaching for it.  He doesn't get it.  Yeah.  He's just reaching for anything that isn't the answer to the question.  Yeah.  This is where he explains why he's upset.  Uh, I'm the, and what, and where's the music?  Where's the music fit into that? 
[01:10:00]  Uh, music?  I didn't know it was, it was a monster magazine.  Right, right.  I've been, I'm, but given that you seem to be quite passionate about music, I was wondering  about your...  Would you say that to Tom Petty?  Would I say that he's passionate about music?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Would you explain why it's not a hobby?  Would I explain why it's not a hobby?  Are you reacting to the fact that I said...  Yeah, I am.  I am.  Since you're instructed not to talk about shit like that, yeah, I am reacting to that.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  I wasn't instructed to, uh, I'm in, I'm instructed, I'm not really instructed.  You guys are here as a band.  You're performing.  Uh, but I...  Well, the producer was instructed.  Right, but...  So, somewhere along the way.  Because I mentioned that you were an actor?  Sorry, I, I forgot to mention it to you.  Why?  Because I mentioned that you were an actor?  Oh, first of all, that wasn't supposed to be mentioned either.  You, you, you would prefer me to only do this interview not mentioning at all, just to  clarify. 
[01:11:00]  That's correct.  At all that you've ever done anything in terms of acting screenwriting.  That's correct.  Oh, get the fuck out of the studio.  He's just being...  Get out!  And, and we said yes to Billy Bob Thornton.  That would be doing great.  No kidding.  Because we would have handled that a lot differently.  Yeah.  Lee.  God, what a...  So basically, everyone's saying that because the host mentioned his, you know, his film  career and wasn't really talking to the rest of the band, Billy Bob just, like, didn't  want to...  And when you have as many hits as Tom Petty, all right, then you might have a leg to stand 
[01:11:30]  on.  Right.  You know, Tom Petty kind of had a few hits back in the 80s.  Right.  But he was being respectful and he was talking to the rest of the band.  Yeah.  He was asking them questions, but then Bore wasn't jumping in, so he went to him.  Right.  And you've got to acknowledge the fact that it's Billy Bob Thornton.  Of course you do.  You can't just, you know, hey, by the way, you know, this is what he's doing.  And who does he think he is?  He's not in the studio because of this band.  No.  So take advantage of the fact that, yeah, you're this big famous movie star and then  maybe you get some exposure for the band. 
[01:12:00]  That's what the guy should have said.  He said, do you even realize that you wouldn't have set foot in this studio if you weren't  Billy Bob Thornton?  Know how many bands on that same level are trying to get in here and we said no to because  their music is just okay right now?  Yeah.  Billy Bob continues.  Or the host tries to explain here.  One of the reasons why you get attention is because of the career you were not there.  All right.  There you go.  Bravo to him.  Well, great minds.  Bravo to him.  Thank a lot.  That's exactly how it works. 
[01:12:30]  The Bacon Brothers.  Yeah, that's another one.  Please.  Kevin Bacon and his brother playing.  Who cares?  Who's booking the Bacon Brothers?  How many people are downloading the Bacon Brothers from iTunes?  All right.  Well.  But you'd have them in here.  You'd say hi to Kevin.  Talk about a few movies.  All right.  Play your stupid song with your brother.  You wouldn't even want to talk about the movies.  You know, I'm not here to talk about that.  Well, you know something?  You're here because you have to talk about that.  Who did that to us? 
[01:13:00]  Someone did.  I just got that too.  I can't remember who.  Somebody pulled that out.  Ludacris.  I'm not here to talk about that.  Well, Ludacris.  Whatever.  Somebody will get it.  One of the reasons why you get attention is because of the career you have.  We're not really new.  You're not?  Well, I've made eight albums.  I know you've made a lot of albums.  How long have the Boxmasters been together for?  I don't know.  Let's see.  A couple of years, maybe?  So, even the greatest bands in the world don't get...  I mean, you...  This douchebag wanted the host to know everything about his dumb band. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of like, okay, hey, well, I didn't know you were a musician.  And then you learned together.  That's kind of the beauty of a radio show, right?  That's how the guy...  The guy's insulted that this guy doesn't know Billy Bob Thornton's band.  He actually thought...  And the music he's done over the years?  Billy Bob thought this guy...  That he was going to walk in.  And this guy was going to go, hey, it's Billy.  Not even the Billy Bob part.  It's Billy from this band.  And just talk about the music.  And never acknowledge that Billy Bob Thornton's in your fucking studio. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  Get out of here.  And if you did do that, you would lose a lot of listeners.  Because like, who's this dumb Billy guy in this stupid band?  Oh, it's Billy Bob Thornton?  Well, now I've got to listen to see what this is about.  I just don't believe it.  I think it's phony.  It sounds phony to me.  I would just talk about Astronaut Farmer.  Like, pick one of his worst movies ever and just talk about that.  Didn't he do the remake of Bad News Bears, too, right?  That, too.  That was horrendous.  And the Woodcocks.  Yeah.  So, Mr. Woodcock. 
[01:14:30]  And don't acknowledge him as Billy Bob Thornton.  Just acknowledge him as Mr. Woodcock.  Oh, would that piss him off?  I mean, part of the attention that you're getting is because of the great career you've had in other ways.  What I'm explaining is I'm not trying to be insulting to your musical.  Well, what I'm explaining is we said to not talk about shit like that.  And we also said...  Shit like in movies?  That we didn't want to hear anything about how this is my first love.  You wouldn't say that to Tom Petty, would you? 
[01:15:00]  I understand music is your first love.  Well, my first love was a chick named Lisa Cohen.  You know what I mean?  What a douchebag.  Yeah, he's just being a douche.  He's not putting on an act.  This is his real personality coming out.  And you would say music is your first love to Tom Petty if you were interviewing him during Waterworld.  Because he was in that.  So you'd be like, wow, you're acting here, you're doing something.  But music is your first love.  Like, this guy is a fucking idiot in so many ways. 
[01:15:30]  He's actually legitimizing Billy Bob as a musician.  And this is why actors don't do interviews, because most of them are just dullards.  What he's saying is, you're not a guy who just jumped on the music bandwagon late.  You've always been really involved in music.  He's actually legitimizing this asshole more than he should.  The guy should have thrown him out of the fucking studio.  He should have said, you know what?  You're being a dick.  Get the fuck out of my studio.  Get out.  My show.  Finally, the last one.  Thornton, well, let it just play out. 
[01:16:00]  This is what Billy Bob decided to do, because he was in a bad mood.  Billy Bob.  Okay, well, listen, you guys are going to play a song for us.  What were you planning on playing?  The guys are going to do an instrumental version of a song called Turn It Over,  which is on this record that we have now.  Okay, you're not going to play?  I'm a drummer.  And you don't have your drums here?  No, we don't cart those around at 6 o'clock in the morning. 
[01:16:30]  Okay.  All right, well, how about we...  Let's hear the instrumental version from the Boxmasters.  What a douchebag.  I'd be like, instrumental version?  Yeah, you could do an acoustic version out on the sidewalk.  He decided he wasn't going to play.  That host couldn't have been nicer.  By the way, Billy Bob's not the drummer.  Is he?  The host should have just thrown him out of the fucking studio.  But the host could not have been nicer.  He was treating them professionally and respectfully.  You know, it's like, that's why it was such a phony act to me. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Because the guy was doing nothing at all.  It was so obvious when he mentioned him as an actor.  Then he went right into talking about music.  Yeah.  I pride myself in knowing, you know, a little bit about music.  I have no fucking idea that he was the drummer.  Does he sing in this band?  I have no idea.  I bet he is...  Does he sing?  I couldn't tell if...  Oh, he does sing.  And he plays drums.  So he decided he wasn't going to sing for this guy.  Wow.  He's a regular Don Henley. 
[01:17:30]  Dumb headset.  Oh, God.  You know, and I bet if you ever went and saw this band and asked him for an autograph,  he would fucking blow you off so quickly.  I'm sure he would.  What about the rest of the guys?  Aren't you going to ask them for autographs?  Don't ask me just because I...  Shut up.  You believe Bob Thornton.  Live with it.  Oh, God.  What a...  Oof.  He's a douchebag.  He really is.  I still like that Sling Blade movie.  Great actor.  Look, that's the thing.  He's a guy who can... 
[01:18:00]  Damn, I like that Sling Blade.  ...put together a movie that well.  It's not that crazy.  He doesn't...  What do you mean how long we've been together?  It's a very simple question.  What was his second best movie?  There's a good question.  Uh...  Bad Santa.  Huh?  Bad Santa.  Oh, yeah.  That was an all right movie.  He did a few other ones, too.  I might go with best.  Armageddon.  That was shit.  That was a pile of shit.  Yeah.  Mm.  All right, what was your name?  You ask me who I am.  I'm not going to play no music, and I'll just be shit of ye. 
[01:18:30]  You shit.  Want to take a break?  Are you guys hearing that popping sound, or am I having a stroke?  No, I think it's Sam.  I don't think...  I didn't unplug anything that time.  I'm teasing, you little cherub.  You've got to be outside awkwardly with your microphone.  All right.  You didn't sit on my pictures, did you?  No, no, no.  No, after the break, you're going to be awkwardly outside the studio with your microphone, and  when people come walking by, because everyone is very curious today, you're going to stop  them and do a little quick, what's the haps?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right?  Sounds good.  Yeah, I bet. 
[01:19:00]  You'd love the idea.  What'd you want, Danny?  A miscarriage?  It just stinks.  It's this closed quarters, everything that everyone has in here.  I just, I dread the day Jimmy has gassers.  Oh, man.  Because this place is going to fill up and just be horrible.  You know what?  If we don't go to break...  Oh, no.  Okay.  You've got to make a run?  And it's a long run.  How far is the...  Oh, man.  That's another thing.  Yeah, you've got to fucking fight it out with 20 other guys taking shits.  It's horrible. 
[01:19:30]  It's a shit factory.  They've got a shit factory bathroom.  We should just get one of those PortoSan portable toilets and set it up right here.  Right in the middle of the console.  Middle of the console joke again.  Oh, my God.  It's crazy.  It's better than Danny's breakfast.  And be healthier.  Jesus.  Quick break.  Sam doing what's the haps right outside the studio.  And...  Is he?  Is he?  Any vacation stories?  Not really.  I don't know.  Do I?  Do I have...  I'm just going to be Billy Bob asshole all day. 
[01:20:00]  What a douche.  I don't know what you mean by that.  What do you mean by that?  No, vacation stories, you know?  You went on vacation?  Anything happen?  Sorry.  Don't...  Yeah.  What do I point to?  Do I just point to space?  Oh, and then...  It has to be a relay?  Yeah.  How about I go to Ant?  All right.  Ant to Jim to Danny.  All right.  All right.  I point.  Oh, Jimmy, you screwed it up.  I don't know what you mean by that.  All right. 
[01:20:30]  It's fun being Billy Bob.  Why would you point?  You wouldn't ask Tom Petty to point.  You wouldn't ask Rick Allen to point.  All right.  All right.  Just go to break.  Try.  Try something.  All right.  Food smell.  Go.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  First day from the brand new studio here at Sirius XM. 
[01:21:00]  Indeed.  Soon to be Sirius.  Really?  What are you hearing?  I mean, come on.  The XM's a little small in the logo.  And it's in parentheses.  Parentheses.  If you know the logo, that's a pretty good joke.  All right.  A lot of parentheses for the XM.  Maybe it's an afterthought.  So, yeah, you got to sprint to the bathroom.  I just learned that.  Yeah, the bathroom's kind of far away.  It's not like the shitter of old. 
[01:21:30]  And it really is a shit factory.  I've never seen more stalls in one bathroom in my life.  I think we have more stalls than Citi Field.  What, does everybody come here straight from the fucking planes that land from Mexico?  It's annoying.  And you have to...  I went down the line.  Sirius just looks like, eh, well, maybe they didn't go over as well.  I could have done more with that.  Did you go to the bathroom yet?  What's that?  Did you go in the bathroom?  You have to kick in the stalls to find a clean one.  The fourth one was the clean one for me. 
[01:22:00]  Who are the animals that have to pee all over the fucking seats?  Ah, that's me.  Are you one of those guys?  No, my aim is very good.  Yeah, but I think people purposely do that.  They have to, like, mark their...  They don't give a shit.  You know what?  Lift the fucking seat up, too.  Use your foot.  It doesn't matter.  You don't have to touch it.  Give it a little more room.  Use your foot.  Now you're not splashing all over the fucking seat.  People got to sit on that.  Maybe someone's taking the boner leak.  Maybe they still have a...  Sitting down or...  Uh-oh.  Oh, the boner...  Might be our neighbors. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, if you're taking a boner leak over there, there's a problem.  Let me move forward for Kenny.  This freaking animal.  During the commercial break, one of the guys just slammed right into the back of my chair.  I was like, oh, man.  I literally have, like, no room back here.  All right.  Now I'm freezing again.  Can we turn up the heat?  Is it cold again?  I haven't been...  Slightly.  Like, you tap it.  It's very small increments until we get it dialed in. 
[01:23:00]  All you do is tap it once and it'll go up 15 degrees.  I don't understand how I have 3G on the iPhone and it won't give me internet.  What the fuck is the use of 3G?  That really sucks, Jimmy.  I don't know what's going on with that.  It sounds nuts.  What mic?  Daniel.  They were named yesterday.  Young Daniel.  I will try this.  Go.  Hey.  Hey.  Nice.  I was having that same problem.  Try rebooting the phone.  Seriously.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sam's first.  Did you turn it off?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sam's first interview. 
[01:23:30]  I didn't mean to interrupt.  Here it is.  Oh, my God.  This is a creep.  Here it is.  What?  Air in 10 minutes.  He's got to be on the air in 10 minutes.  Okay.  10 minutes.  We need him for four.  He laughed already.  Your mic crapped.  I figured out which mic yours was at the last second.  So what happened there, Sam?  I said, excuse me, sir.  And he looked up and he shook his head and said, I got to be on the air in 10 minutes and  walked away.  Did he have like news copy?  He had papers.  He had papers?  Yeah.  And he had a collar.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  It's like a businessman type thing.  Yeah.  What butcher?  Why don't you tell him?  Commercial's allowed and the.  What happened?  Show's coming in low, but the commercial's allowed.  Butch's fucking dopey Boris fucking Karloff hairdo.  I've had enough of Butch's fucking Frankenstein head.  All right.  This petrified cat at the stadium is hysterical.  Have you seen the clip of this?  Yeah.  City killed.  Hey, have you seen the clip of the cat at the. 
[01:24:30]  That's home opener.  Yeah.  And the cat decided to ruin everyone's fun.  And it's insane.  You can tell it's just so scared.  And it's jumping up on people.  And they're.  I hope they show.  Look at this lady.  It doesn't know where to go.  What?  Make sure you check that video out today.  That cat's freaking out.  That lady had no idea the cat was jumping up like that.  I have internet on my iPhone, Jimmy.  Why don't you?  Because it's a fucking weird technology.  Maybe when I reboot it, like Danny said.  You don't like it. 
[01:25:00]  It doesn't like you.  It hates me.  I got internet, too.  I've been freaking tweeting away.  You're tweeting.  I just took a picture of the long, long hallway that we're going to be bowling on tomorrow morning.  The vacation tweets were very entertaining.  Everybody's vacation tweets.  Just like being dumb.  We were all just twittering during our vacation.  Mine were boring.  I was just doing, like, scenery shots.  That's all I was doing.  My scenery just happened to be, like, asses.  Oh, I heard about that. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was just all, like, chicks by the pool.  And I was taking their pictures.  I was a creep taking pictures of people.  Yeah.  And then I was doing a thing where I would kind of walk by with the phone in my hand and go, chick, chick.  Just click as they're laying down in the sun.  Uh-huh.  And post that one.  That was fantastic.  Oh, there's one of you with the dolphins.  That's a good show.  Well, come on now.  I hope he's got his two-dolphin power.  Someone's like, why does it look like a picture from 1987?  No, I took a picture of a picture. 
[01:26:00]  You know, I did the dumb tourist thing, and you'd buy the pictures at the end.  Of course.  And I said, all right, fuck, I'll share my dolphin ride.  Why don't you own a flatbed scanner?  Yeah, vacation.  That dolphin thing is such a scam.  Is it?  Well, they try to make believe that you're actually communicating with the dolphins.  Yeah.  You pay a shitload of money.  You stand in water that's halfway up to your knees on a platform.  The dolphins are in the actual pool in front of you.  Uh-huh.  And then the trainer has trained these fucking things to make it look like you're actually 
[01:26:30]  communicating with the dolphins.  But you're not?  No.  They've figured out some tricks that make it look like you're communicating with the dolphins.  Oh.  But they're doing all that shit to get their dumb fish.  Oh, here's Sam.  Another interview going down.  Okay.  Excuse me, sir?  Yes.  What's your name?  My name is Ryan Sampson.  I host the morning mashup on Sirius.  How are you?  Oh, the morning mashup.  Oh, cool, Ryan Sampson.  What's the haps?  The haps is water over this way.  Would you guys like some water?  We can get you some.  No, thanks.  That's cool.  You got the nice radio voice.  Thank you.  What's the morning mashup?  We're on Sirius Hits 1. 
[01:27:00]  It's the Top 40 station.  We're right next door.  You guys are like our new neighbors.  Wait, are you the gay guys?  Yes.  No.  No.  Wait, we heard hip-hop, gay.  Top 40.  Martha Stewart.  Where's the Top 40?  No, we're two studios down.  Sirius Hits 1.  It's like two studios down.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  There's Free Soda.  He's right after the There Goes the Neighborhood studio.  What song is playing so you can get water?  What song is playing so you can get water?  Kelly Clarkson.  Kelly Clarkson.  Ah. 
[01:27:30]  On Hits 1 right now.  Can I say one thing?  The fucking break room's a hit.  Really?  I couldn't get out of there.  It's fucking tiny.  Yeah.  It's like a port-a-john, and there's free coffee, which is shitty.  But there's also a vending machine, and there's free sodas.  I couldn't.  Really?  I took some pretzels.  You see how much milk they bring in every morning?  That's probably for the week.  Very wholesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Good job on what's the haps there.  Thank you very much.  Why didn't you do the black guy?  You were scared he was going to punch you?  We were talking to Ryan Sampson. 
[01:28:00]  The black guy walked by and just tapped Sam on the shoulder and looked at him like, hey,  little man.  Job cracker.  Yeah.  No, but with the dolphin thing, so they train the dolphins to come out of the water so you  can hold their flippers like you're shaking their hands.  Right.  The dolphin is just doing that to get the dumb fish.  They could give a shit about you.  Yeah, their whole motivation is, mmm, fish.  Right.  Food.  It's like a dog.  You teach them tricks, you give them a little doggy treat.  I really wish I didn't do that, because I really want to believe that, you know, maybe  we're close to dolphins and intelligence. 
[01:28:30]  Do you think the trainers are close to them, though?  No.  It's all, no.  It's all just behavior.  They're teaching them some dumb behavior that looks like it might be something.  Hmm.  Fuck no.  I think dolphins are stupid.  Because, well, because, see, when I was down in Atlantis, that's where I spent my vacation.  You did dolphins, too?  Not really.  No, I didn't.  But, well, see, the girl that I was with down there decided at about two in the morning 
[01:29:00]  that she was going to go over by the dolphins and climb the fence.  She climbed the fence?  So she climbed the fence, got in there, and was petting the dolphins, and, like, yeah,  it was definitely the secret mission.  Are you serious?  Oh, yeah.  So she's petting him and playing with him and making him come up to her hand, like, doing  those things.  That fucking rules!  So she just, and she's got pictures of her doing that, which was pretty goddamn funny. 
[01:29:30]  Did she get caught?  No!  No, if she got caught, she'd have been in a bohemian prison.  So she climbed the fence.  I said, you're insane.  How did you do it?  She goes, I went around to the gate, and, of course, it was locked, so I just kept going  around and found this fence that had some, like, pockets in it.  Right, right.  That she could get her feet in, climbed up, and was on that thing that you were just talking  about, the platform that's, like, almost under the water a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  And the dolphins were all following her back and forth as she walked, going, making the  clicking noises. 
[01:30:00]  That's pretty cool.  And then she was petting one of the dolphins' tongues, and the dolphins was gently kind  of nibbling at her hand, and then she was just petting them, feeling, and they'd roll  over, and you could rub their bellies and stuff like that.  Right.  And she didn't pay a dime.  That's awesome.  She just came back?  Hold on, and what's the happiness going down?  Save that thought.  We'll go right back to the dolphins in a second.  Sam.  Hello, sir.  What's your name?  My name is Stanley T.  What's up?  Where are you going, Stanley?  To do the morning mashup show on Sirius 6-1.  Wait.  XM 20 on 20. 
[01:30:30]  But Ryan Sampson does the morning mashup.  There's four of us.  Like, this is the opening in Anthony's show, right?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Brian.  Welcome to Sirius.  What's going on?  Thank you, sir.  All right.  What do you do for the show, though?  Because I've never heard the show.  What do you do for the show?  I'm a host.  There's four of us.  Cool.  What are you guys talking about today?  We were just talking about children suing their parents over punishment.  Wow.  The six-year-old kid sued his dad over punishment that was too harsh.  Wow.  You've got a producer.  With four hosts, are you worried that one or two of you might get canned? 
[01:31:00]  Worry?  No.  We don't worry here.  Why not?  Wow.  We don't worry at Sirius.  No.  We just do great radio.  All the legends of radio in this building.  Well.  Y'all know that.  What y'all doing here?  Legends.  Being legends.  There you go.  That's what I'm saying.  I like this guy.  So check out the morning mashup when you guys can.  I've heard of y'all.  Welcome to Sirius.  We're right next door, by the way.  All right.  We're going to come in and do your show now.  See you guys later.  Thank you.  There it is.  The morning mashup is a couple of studios down. 
[01:31:30]  It is odd to just have so many different studios in this place.  We're going to have to be schizo because as these interviews come, I've got to interrupt  you.  But I need to know more about the dolphins, man.  It's a real beehive of activity here.  It certainly is.  Because that's what I wanted to do was go freestyle with the dolphins.  Fuck this controlled environment they've got going on.  Yeah.  Because they said you swim with the dolphins.  They let you do two things.  You jump in the pool and you have to swim out to a, quote, lifeguard, even though you're  wearing a life vest.  It's ridiculous.  And then you do two dumb little stunts you've seen at SeaWorld. 
[01:32:00]  Like, you think when you see those people at SeaWorld, like, wow, they must have trained  for years to do that.  No, anyone could do it, obviously, because I have a picture of one of them.  No life vest, no nothing, out in the middle of the goddamn thing with the dolphins.  Did she jump in?  No, no.  She stayed on the platform.  But the dolphins do that thing where they swim and then slide up onto the platform.  Right.  So, you know, right there.  That's pretty cool.  Right there, actually, with the dolphins.  Nothing but props for that, because that's exactly what I wanted to do.  That's pretty, I heard that, I'm like, oh my God, that's crazy. 
[01:32:30]  She could have been the polar bear lady, though.  Yeah, I know.  Polar bear lady is the best.  Oh, she's so happy.  We could say it's a polar bear lady for your story.  That woman loves polar bears.  What a fucking dummy.  So many people were hoping it was Lady Trucker, by the way.  Oh, because there was...  Was it a bear?  There was a similarity in figures.  Her face.  Let's play the story just to bring everyone up to speed on this.  It is probably the best thing that happened during our break. 
[01:33:00]  Here's the polar bear lady story from Germany, which also leads to a pretty good gay elephant  story.  From Germany.  Ja, it's the polar bear.  Ja, it's good.  Good.  Ah.  A gay elephant.  Frechen.  Frechen.  No.  For real, I got a gay elephant story that's going to make you laugh, but first the polar bear  lady.  I resent that.  There you go.  Damn.  Look at Sam just awkwardly in the hallway.  I know.  I love it.  A video you have to see to believe from the Berlin Zoo in Germany. 
[01:33:30]  A woman jumps into the polar bear habitat during feeding time.  Take a look.  After she jumped the fence, zoo officials jumped into action.  They tossed her rescue rings to hoist her out of the polar pool.  You can see that the woman has bitten several times.  She is now hospitalized with what authorities are calling severe injuries.  Look at that polar bear attack right there.  It's unclear why the woman entered the bear habitat in the first place.  The police have now issued her a citation for trespassing. 
[01:34:00]  How great.  Trespassing.  For once, they're pissed at the human, by the way.  For once, they're pissed at the human being.  They're basically saying, you know, because usually they end up killing the, what, the polar  bears, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Even though you went into their environment.  Once they get a taste of blood.  But in this case, they're pissed off at her.  They're fining her and trying to, you know, get her up on charges and all sorts of shit.  Turns out she was pissed off.  She lost her job.  Oh, was that it?  She was not even pissed off.  She was distraught and jumped in because... 
[01:34:30]  Was her boss a polar bear?  Like, why would...  Oh, I lost my job.  Let me jump in with a polar bear.  Maybe she worked on the first season and lost...  Oh, the polar bears.  I don't even know what that means, but I think it's a good one.  Did you see them trying to fish her out?  Ah, this is fantastic.  Oh, my God.  They're going back for her.  It's like bobbing for...  The bears are bobbing for her.  Ah, they toss in her life...  Like, life rings.  Oh!  Bear got a nice piece of her back right there.  Why the fuck is she coming out? 
[01:35:00]  She jumped in.  Why is she trying to get out?  Because she realized, ow, this hurts.  When did you think she realized it was a bad idea?  As soon as she hit the water?  The minute she...  Ah!  She dropped back in.  Oh, and the bear goes back for her.  Yay.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, this guy's shaking his head.  What?  Excuse me, sirs.  What's your name?  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Where do those guys have to go besides not to do sit-ups?  Those are the gentlemen from the Al Q morning show.  Oh!  They don't want anything to do with us?  They don't want to talk to us.  They're on the air.  They don't have time. 
[01:35:30]  They were not happy.  They don't have time.  They didn't look happy, though.  Steve, what was that about?  They were very upset.  Why?  We're trying to get to know people around here.  As they were walking away, I heard one guy say, oh, they came for us.  And then...  They didn't come for you.  Exactly.  We would if you wanted us to.  Yeah, whatever you need.  Ah, that's...  God, we just want to...  I'm sure we'll get to know them later.  Sam is such an asshole.  Exactly. 
[01:36:00]  I love it.  How they didn't stop for a twinkish little Sam.  It's amazing.  They were two big bears.  Yes.  Speaking of polar bears.  Yes.  All right.  Well...  Ah...  Now people are avoiding Sam.  I know.  I noticed that.  And you know what it is?  See, here's the reputation you get.  It's not even that we're being idiots.  We're just coming by.  They tell us where they work, what they do.  We have a little quick discussion, and then they're on their way.  It worked great with the top 40 station, the morning mashup guys. 
[01:36:30]  Our new friend Ryan.  Our new friend Ryan from the morning mashup.  Who's the other dude?  I forgot his name.  So did I.  Oh, boy.  The other guy from the morning mashup.  The other guy.  The top.  And then...  All right.  We get dissed like that.  Remember that, Sam.  That goes in the remember that file.  What were we saying about the polar bear lady?  Oh, yeah.  That she's an idiot?  That she can't really hold on.  No, look. 
[01:37:00]  She can't get her fat ass out of the fucking polar bear pit.  They're trying to drag her up.  Give her a wedgie on the way up.  Yeah.  And she was smiling at first, which is really great.  There's a great picture of her smiling.  Like, oh, I'm so happy to be here.  The next picture is her screaming in pain as this bear is digging into the back of her neck.  It just sucks.  This is my friend from the IT department who was fixing my computer this morning.  Good morning.  What's your name?  My name is Suresh.  How are you?  Good, Suresh. 
[01:37:30]  What's the haps?  Nothing much.  Shift is ending.  Getting ready to go home.  Feeling good.  Oh, overnight.  Sam, ask if his life has changed since Slumdog Millionaire.  See, perhaps that's why.  Millionaire.  Perhaps that's why people aren't stopping.  He looks like it with the beard.  Suresh, has your life as a game show host changed since Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  Sam, get this guy.  Since Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  It's Slumdog Millionaire.  Do you have a second?  Oh, what did I say?  It's a mile a minute here.  What's your name? 
[01:38:00]  Larry Kerwin.  Larry Kerwin, what do you do here?  I do the Celtic Crush, the Celtic show.  Oh, nice.  I've heard a lot of good things.  What's the haps?  What's the what?  Haps.  What do you mean?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  That's what I said.  Oh, what do you mean?  It's like, what's the haps, you know?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  New lingo.  I just wanted to do the show.  Cool.  What time does it start?  Starts ten minutes ago.  Oh, you're late. 
[01:38:30]  Wait a minute.  Was he Ron Bennington?  Perpetually late.  Yeah, we need to know what the show's about.  The Celtic Crush is all music or is it talk to?  What's the Celtic Crush all about?  What's the deal with that?  Well, it's a mixture of all types of music that come from the Celtic nations.  Rock music and traditional music mixed in with a bit of talk about it.  You know, how it came about.  Is it shock jock stuff?  No, it's not shock jock.  No.  Very discreet. 
[01:39:00]  Wait.  I tell no stories about the various musicians I know, being one myself.  Wait.  Sam, I didn't really understand the description of the show.  Oh, could you further?  I was reading some instant feedback.  Our hosts were reading the feedback.  They don't always pay attention.  Could you further describe the show?  It's music mainly?  It's mostly music.  Music from all the different Celtic nations.  And then I'm a musician myself.  I'm with the band Black 37.  So it's stories about the music and about the musicians who make it. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  Cool.  This is going great.  I hope so.  Well, it's been...  Is it hapsenough?  It is hapsenough.  It's been a pleasure...  I don't care.  I don't care.  It's been a pleasure talking to you and break a leg today.  I'll try.  Take care, man.  Thank you.  Making friends here at SiriusXM.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  As soon as I saw...  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  As soon as I said, Sam, and then I asked him again, and I see the thing going down over 
[01:40:00]  the front of the template going on the sound machine.  So I could pick some good ones.  These are not going to be cheers.  These are not going to be...  So far, though, Sam, everyone being...  Just about everyone being very nice to us.  Except for those out-cue guys.  Yeah, they ran away.  Maybe they've heard our show.  Well, that could be...  Okay.  Maybe you got a point.  Right.  All right.  We got to...  I wonder if Kenny went to some type of vineyard for my grapes.  Where?  He's over there with his glasses on. 
[01:40:30]  There's some kind of issue.  He's on the phone.  Look at Kenny.  I'm on the phone with the grape distributor.  Kenny's making arrangements for the radio program, doing security work.  He's trying to figure out, like, where he's going to get our food.  Kenny, what's the haps?  Kenny, what are you doing?  I'm tracking down muscle milk for you, G.H.  And Anthony's grapes will be here before they turn into raisins.  Very funny.  Are you a bit stressed today? 
[01:41:00]  Because you like a routine.  Kenny is all about having a routine.  Yes, he is.  This throws you into a frenzy.  I am so happy to be here.  He's not saying anything.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  All right, carry on.  Well, you've got to hear this story.  It's a quickie.  A Polish politician is criticizing his local zoo.  He walked into it.  What?  For taking in a gay elephant named Ninio, who prefers male companions. 
[01:41:30]  And sold me a queer giraffe.  And will reportedly probably not procreate.  Yeah.  We didn't pay 37 million ziloits?  Z-L-O-T-Y-S?  Polish money.  Is that Polish?  They're not on the euro or something?  No, they're just rocks with numbers written on them.  We didn't pay 37 million Polish money units. 
[01:42:00]  Go out, lose.  Which comes out to 11 million for us Americans.  For the largest elephant house in Europe to have a gay elephant live there, said Michael  Z-Z-Z.  It's another vowel.  A conservative councilman in the city of blah, blah, in western blah, blah.  Just walks around with his trunk up his ass.  All the time.  oh a little elephant walk for everybody yeah turn this up where's billy bob yeah

[01:43:30]  well maybe in a week a week by tomorrow two days yeah we have another um story about something  i was gonna say an animal story but then again a bee's not an animal well this guy survived a bunch  of bee stings anybody want to guess how many four one billion okay somewhere in between four and a 
[01:44:00]  billion yes yes jeff moser is just lucky to be alive more than three thousand killer bees stung the  man dotting his skin with thousands you know what because i just need to know if this is true  sorry marcel from rhode island i have a new story for you guys good old put in head ted kennedy  threw out the first pitch opening day for the red sox yeah supposedly he threw it three feet  and then he tried again and threw it another three feet for real yeah the catcher yeah the catcher get me 
[01:44:30]  the video uh was standing right in front of him and he he just kind of almost did this shot putty kind  of he couldn't do it here it is oh my god yeah yeah look look look look oh my staring him down  oh my god are you kidding oh jeez how the mighty have fallen jesus mark fidrich could have thrown that  further from underneath the dump truck holy shit that's terrible too soon perfect too soon and then 
[01:45:00]  he tried it again um and actually i guess uh he he caught it the catcher was four to five feet in  front of him and he couldn't hit him poor ted thank you for that story marcel i did not uh see that one  all right back to the bees by the way if they're killer bees and three thousand stung him and he's  alive yeah they're not that bad three thousand stings and he's still alive jeff moser is just lucky to 
[01:45:30]  be alive more than three thousand killer bees stung the nevada man dotting his skin with thousands of  painful red wounds pulled him out of my mouth and pulled him out of my nose and and kept my eyes  closed so i wouldn't be blind about a week ago moser was helping a friend clean up his yard  he moved to shrub and found a seventy pound hive full of bees bees that swarmed all over him  instantly the father of four says he screamed for someone to call 9-1-1 i kept blowing them out of 
[01:46:00]  my mouth and pulled them out of my mouth so i could breathe by the time he got to the hospital in las  vegas the poison was causing him to swell at every injection point he was having trouble breathing and  his organs were starting to shut down a medical team of six people pulled each of the stingers out  and his wife had him transferred to the toxicology unit at a phoenix hospital for more specialized care  i think he's very lucky that he got good medical care every step of the way moser was left with a  weakened heart and no functioning kidneys he has dialysis treatments and a long recovery ahead of him 
[01:46:30]  but he's out of the hospital and happy to be alive wait what happened  the poison just fucked his organs up holy shit stupid bees i i i was i gotta be honest i i was  listening to that story and it was nice and then i i was watching sam kenny and mars uh do a little  gossiping outside the studio oh are they already gossiping about things what were they gossiping about 
[01:47:00]  sam they're bothering me mars keeps telling me to get a longer cord so i can go down further but i am  informing him that then i won't be able to see you yeah because that would be down too far that's true  and then kenny said that a certain type of people to identify themselves wear cock rings on their belt  loops which is information i didn't ask for but received is that true  allegedly oh allegedly okay i thought maybe you had some confirmation 
[01:47:30]  oh my god what are we doing to ourselves again  what happened to the hallway it was very busy 20 minutes ago yeah i think the word got out i've been  watching avoid the assholes people are coming halfway down the hall and taking the long way by turning  and going down the other hallway you gotta hide a little bit sam okay it looks very obvious  exactly what you want okay oh you'll be able to figure it out i'll just get low all right

[02:08:00]  headphone cable so he can go even further yeah why couldn't we just run the cables from our old  studio to here at this point yeah that would have been nice yeah just stay there and run some cable  all right all right he's he's working on how come no one will come down this hallway  because um listening to the show no one likes us it's amazing we're not liked hated is more accurate  yeah like it's so weird we're just not liked but we didn't do it's our first day and we already 
[02:08:30]  have cooties in school we should have tippy tom walking up and down these hallways already oh  but that'd be fantastic we're like the kid that threw up in in at lunch it just sticks with you  where's the open at the studio how you do it just wander around i'm tippy top just stinking up the  entire place oh boy do i not want him in the studio oh and here dude it would be a gas chamber he'd have 
[02:09:00]  to be in the in the fucking in travis's little area back there yes beyond the glass yeah we'll figure  something out cue out pew actually we're working on our our next hippie tom bit yeah he's gonna be  doing some wine tasting all right yeah i got a sophisticated palette it's 91 points  it's a smooth little wine yeah this smells like uh dumpster 14th street 
[02:09:30]  wait what is that nice color it's like when i got kicked in the kidneys and was urinating for a week  all right uh thumbs up cut off six all right six is off  oh again we get that nice silence i like i like the hallway noise it's kind of nice yeah  little ambient sound oh my god i i see more wires how far are we taking this bernie williams from 
[02:10:00]  the yankees is releasing an out for something he's playing yeah don't talk to him that he's um bernie  williams though he's been doing that's very mad anyone he's a good guitar player yeah a jazz guy  yeah is he yeah let's get him in plays jazz guitar oh we oh that's why that was good  his his his wife was that one that sat behind home plate with that goddamn thing  making a noise when uh the other people would come up to bat that was bernie's wife yes oh yeah 
[02:10:30]  how embarrassing oh how what an annoying  bitch shut up why'd he tell her stop it she probably was the pants of the family what's going  on there can you hear me yeah i think we hooked up too many wires i think there's so many wires now  i think there's a little resistance problem going on a few too many connections a little too much wire  for the signal to travel through without a boost yeah i'm almost at our office which is a hunt a hundred 
[02:11:00]  feet or more away from the studio it's at least a hundred that mike was not made to be hooked up  to that many cables you can tell we are way down the hall it needs an extra uh it needs some extra of  voltage yes now what sam well now everyone ran away from there everybody when i came here as i was  walking down the hall two people jumped into these voiceover studios oh yeah i don't know if they're  actually recording their voices or not fresh your balls against the window like bat wings 
[02:11:30]  someone is suggesting we set up detour signs so they have to come  that's funny yeah well well no no one thing sam there's troy i'm right by troy's desk yeah  try he's an all right dude hey troy means the city in upstate new york come here  come here troy they want to talk a long cable 
[02:12:00]  what's going on they're setting up another wire no way for real just gonna get more crackling for  real okay they had they gave me more headphones all right there you go he's going to be out of  view now yeah because he's going around that corner he is so far away we have never  we have never had anybody this far away with a wired mic okay i'm sitting down at troy's desk  it's right so troy what are you doing here today nope nope just hanging out uh join the show 
[02:12:30]  opening line wrong oh um oh i'm sorry how could i have forgotten hi troy i'm sam from the opian anthony  show we have two offices and 12 tvs so far how are you i know it's been quite an ordeal getting  them all to work but uh i guess they're they're putting the last two in right now ask if he has  any tvs i see here at your workstation you have a lot of gadgets how many tvs do you have unfortunately 
[02:13:00]  none but i'm going to come in and uh watch your guys tv if that's all right well we have 12. i know  i know it's quite impressive for real we have 12 tvs seriously we have 12 it's not an exaggeration if you  count all in the studio and in our two offices we have a total of 12 flat screen hd tvs it's crazy  that's craziness and on all those 12 tvs we only watch four different channels um how many channels  do you watch on your tv here at your desk absolutely none i'm staring at a profit screen right now you 
[02:13:30]  don't have a tv that's right i don't we have 12 screens tomorrow on all 12 tvs i want the yule log  tomorrow opie is going to play the yule log on all 12 of his tvs are you going to have anything to  play the yule log on unfortunately no they should put out in the lobby too the yule log we have more  tvs than the lobby yeah i know we have two offices i know it's crazy tell them we have so many tvs so 
[02:14:00]  the talent doesn't have to crank their necks the reason that we have a lot of people have been saying  why do you guys have 12 tvs it's because the talent opie anthony and jim norton doesn't like to  crick their necks it's understandable i mean you know you got to deliver radio gold so you don't want  to hey sam right too far out if uh troy understands that you should start telling him that we need some  of his space listen troy um i see you do have a really nice station here but you have a lot of space 
[02:14:30]  for one for one person don't you think yeah just send somebody over here somebody else can join well  i mean because your desk is close to our office so if we kind of brought our office knock this  state workstation out it'll give you guys a little more room so maybe your your office your desk here  could be half the size i'll slide down one i'll go down there oh this is thrilling banter yeah way to  know uh when to you know bail sam good idea that's not tall he is right all right troy look at mars

[02:25:30]  building works all your mailboxes and stuff is in like a common area so eventually you do run into  everybody that lives in your building so there's this elderly divorce couple they live in the same  building and every time the man runs into the woman now he's in a wheelchair don't forget so he wheels  his wheelchair into her while uh hurling nasty names at her like uh bitch whore uh i think lesbian was  another one this guy was like in his 80s hitting over the wheelchair nice it was definitely one of my  favorite vacation so uh he's still got that old spark no matter what's going on to me imagine you 
[02:26:00]  just hate somebody that long and you know 25 years after you're even done with her every time you look  it still just comes right back oh that's his ex yeah yeah yeah actually let me do let me do a little  reading because it's worth it a crotchety he sounds pretty crotchety doesn't he it starts off a crotchety  old man was arrested after repeatedly ramming his ex-wife with a motorized wheelchair in the lobby  of their staten island apartment complex it was motorized yeah oh i thought it was just wheeling 
[02:26:30]  into her 12 years after their bitter divorce 12 years paul 85 year old uh paul simone's 85 year  old heart is filled with hate for the woman he married nearly 40 years ago uh it doesn't help that they  live in the same building when he sees me all hell breaks loose said uh jenny simone i'm afraid of him i want  them to get him out of the building they live on different floors and separate wings of the  sprawling seven-story apartment complex and a judge's restraining order compels paul to steer clear of 
[02:27:00]  his ex such attacks often include paul's uttering whore and bitch and turns unfit for most ears jenny  said that means the big c word oh yeah can't put that in an ap story uh but the latest tirade uh turned  physical when i came into the lobby he was there jenny said uh i ignored him he spits at me he calls  me a whore and a lesbian i fucking love this guy can we get him on the phone we should try uh jenny 
[02:27:30]  said uh she was pushing a shopping cart which came in handy when he started bearing down on her with  the wheelchair he has used in suffering a stroke several years ago she fended him off until a  neighbor came by and he pulled a u-turn and sped back to his apartment and he was charged blah blah  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all right that's it that's a good story oh look at him was that him  he does look crotchety oh boy does he look crotchety there we go yeah oh does he not look like a nice 
[02:28:00]  man mess he looks like every klansman that goes to trial like after the year 2000 for a 60s bombing of a  black church yes he's what i always imagined the uncle paul looking like oh no yeah a little bit  uncle paul's gotta yeah uncle paul's younger than that i'm 57 years young 58 march  oh can we play uh his hover around is he hitting her with the hover around oh and that's her oh god 
[02:28:30]  would i bash into her too make her bigger danny i want to see her picture with her stupid cotton candy red  hair her face looks like it's been bashed in already bashed apart yeah oh oh my god you know  something i would love to see pictures of them when they were first married oh my god i bet it i bet  there was like wonderful and they were all full of love and now he's calling her uh the c word spitting 
[02:29:00]  at her yeah and running into her with a little rascal gotta love that guy how do you not love him i do  it's fantastic are we allowed to play that audio well we're uh it's being screened why i made a copy  it's being screened by uh all right by our boss we had someone bitching about us already  what time is he on because i guess we took his studio and not happy that we have 12 tvs who would  be what time is he on i don't know i think you guys uh are are uh competing morning shows really are 
[02:29:30]  we it's like a fucking studio is like a best buy it really we do have a ridiculous amount of  television all right hopefully if we can't play the audio then we're gonna do a little uh we have  our transcriptions we're gonna do a little play a little acting erock's gonna be the lead for this  one because we don't have david today and we can't wait until tomorrow when david is here and uh  uh you're you're you like uh the flying stories oh yeah they're always cute that's a good one 
[02:30:00]  right yeah you know which one i'm talking about yes i do passenger lands plane at fort myers after  pilot dies in the cockpit wow dude every time i take a flight that's one of the things i think  about i look at their health and go will this guy die in midair is this guy gonna make it but uh  it was a smaller plane so um they didn't have a co-pilot or anything five people on board pilot dies  wow and they just happened one of the five happened to be uh some kind of pilot it was a  small plane yeah a pilot's license right um but he wasn't rated for a twin engine like this you 
[02:30:30]  hear the audio where he's going what does this mean what does that mean yeah uh what is it he's  probably used to a little cessna you know take it up do we have that audio much like a volkswagen  in the sky you can get it yeah let's get it it was on cnn late last night they they  they fucking the situation room teased the audio for two hours they got me i watched cnn for two  more hours than i wanted to because of this story coming up coming up coming up and and it was two 
[02:31:00]  hours later they finally played it i'll tell you one thing though it does really help that the guy  knew something about uh how to fly a plane whether he doesn't know about the instruments and things  like that is one thing or or the the different things you get with a dual engine right but he knows  the the physics yeah of flight and what it takes to land a plane so the ironic thing is the pilot  died in a car accident how did that happen i don't know i think i might have like this 
[02:31:30]  yeah it does kind of sound like that doesn't it i think i have our crotch the old man's uh contact  information so i'm gonna go give him a bye yeah let's get him on the phone yes he's been up trying to  shit for four hours already we'll get the audio as they're talking him in the guy talking him in  was like well obviously he's gonna be calm he's yeah he's on the ground he's fine just don't crash  into me asshole it's your flaming wreckage all right let's uh let's go back to sam 
[02:32:00]  sam all the way down the hall that's right and with more cable than ever really oh yeah we have a lot  of cords we have two interns now following me around with bundles of cords that are plugged in  we should brag about how much uh cord we have yeah hmm well who's around here what type of person  would you like to talk to today well it's up to you sam you're down there exactly we can't even see you  anymore okay fortunately we can hear you yeah well uh we have this gentleman who's listening to our  show right now uh what you may not know about our show sir is i'm sam from obi and anthony and 
[02:32:30]  these two offices here are both for our show and we also have 12 tvs so far what do you have  i have a studio that no joke was a closet four years ago that they turned into a studio  where is this closet means it literally uh down the hall from your guys studio  okay because we have some extra stuff from the old place so we may have to go ahead and take over that 
[02:33:00]  uh closet for some of our stuff if you could kind of move maybe a couple of your things out we have  a couple tvs that we haven't found room to hang up yet so we may need your to use your area as a  storage facility is that okay that's fine i guess because all the suits are kind of been like pissing  themselves for like four months since all of a sudden it's been announced you guys were coming here so i  guess they would make me do it anyway oh what's your name my name's steve well steve yes ask steve uh  what the vibe is on us finally coming here sam now that we're finally here what's what's been the vibe 
[02:33:30]  on us i think it's kind of funny actually but i'm pretty sure the suits have all been running around like  really scared that you guys were coming and wondering if they were going to get harassed in  the hallways that's why i think they're hiding in their glass aquariums  why is everyone so scared of us just meeting new people uh i think that because the other  type of show here like yours or like howard is kind of in the back but you guys are out in front so 
[02:34:00]  i think they're scared that uh as they walk by they will be harassed oh i see all right well we'll  move on to the next person but thanks for your time steve no problem all right who else is around  here i have pepsi sucks yeah it's if you're gonna drink just how far why were you drinking that i'm  gay oh i'm seeing uh okay how far we can go down because a couple of these areas are empty and that's 
[02:34:30]  people run away from you is that what it is i thought maybe they just hadn't gotten here yet  no well they're avoiding you have you seen anyone with designer glasses yet not yet but not to worry  because we're going to go ahead and plug in another uh headphone wire right now  look how far i can't see him i really can't see he's almost a dot sam you're almost a dot  okay well i'm i mean if it wasn't for that huge afro of yours we wouldn't know it was you no i

[02:51:30]  i do believe that's when he made his kind of mark of the business that's so angry and uh he's not happy  that uh we're taking over studio and we got tvs and then he and then he goes for the typical howard stern  crap with us oh maybe that's what they're cutting out where's z rock to play alex and then we need  someone to play albert who hasn't been on the air yet travis can play albert what a what a 
[02:52:00]  fucking douchebag i'm reading the transcript yeah what a fucking douchebag this guy is  mm-hmm i'm 40 and i've never heard of him i'm sure they're gonna give away okay  like they do for everyone else's i don't even know what he means i can't tell what's sarcastic  and what stupid rock you're gonna play the part of alec uh or alex bennett okay and uh travis you're  gonna play albert who's albert uh danny i i guess he's his co-host co-host or like yeah board guy

[02:57:00]  screens you're right you didn't do the fist on the console follow the directions in the yeah you're  right that's what they are they're me with a bunch of i want a flat screen in here but opie and anthony are  the poor man's howard right yeah there you go i wouldn't say that why because it's a different  act thank you oh it's a different act yeah yeah howard's uh good and they're terrible you think  i'm giving them a bad time because they took our studio do you think they'll come over and say they're 
[02:57:30]  happy we're all at the same place together no in fact i think that when they find out you were  saying nasty things about they'll try to get me fired well they'll first make sure you don't do that  anymore then get uh some of the bosses to say hey alex don't do that anymore uh first of all let me  interject here we don't do that no we get on the air and beat the shit out of you uh you then uh get  beat up so badly that you usually run to the bosses and tell us to stop that's the way it's worked 
[02:58:00]  in every situation we've been in we pull out the atomic bomb we drop it on uh whoever's giving us  shit and uh they turn around and say please make them stop we've never told a fucking uh boss to have  people to stop uh to make people stop talking about us that ain't happened we encourage our listeners  to listen to your show i'm i'm i'm willing i'm confident enough in this show yes we are to say 
[02:58:30]  our listeners should listen to your show and if you do a better show then our listeners should stay  there i think judging by this that you're just a cranky guy who didn't get as far as you wanted to  get and tough that you got booted out of your studio tough you don't like it  fucking quit and get on that flat screen no you don't 12 of them why don't you show them  counting show video on that bald head of yours i'll be pounding the phone

[02:59:30]  you think i'm giving them a bad time because they took our studio do you think they'll come over and  say that they're happy because we're all at the same place together no in fact i think when they find  out you were saying nasty things about them they'll try to get me fired well they'll first make sure you  don't do that anymore they'll get uh some of the bosses to say hey alex don't do that anymore  really they do that oh yeah they always used to accuse howard of that no they'll do that to you  oh really yeah oh hey lapdog we this show has never done that to another radio show nope and as far

[03:31:30]  remember your dungeon dragons guy died dave uh  arneson the other guy the only guy does anyone really know a huge crowd near sam now we might  have to go down there one last time phone taxes are sell hell we were just talking about this and  now it's a really big deal here in new york especially uh 11 federal state and city levies  at as much as 33 percent of the cost of new yorkers cell phones 33 that is ridiculous there's no 
[03:32:00]  reason for that so obviously if your cell phone bills a hundred dollars 33 dollars of that is for  fucking taxes and what what not and they're still broke a typical cell plan costing 49.99 a month  comes with a total tax bill of ten dollars and fifty nine cents holy  fucking what what are they doing for you what are they giving you for that uh tax money that helps  give new york the fourth highest cell phone taxes of any state and that's fourth place 
[03:32:30]  three other states higher point is first california i don't know someone with a 29.99 t-mobile  basic plan with 300 minutes pays 6.95 in taxes monthly jesus uh and then it goes on it just keeps  pushing the point forward i don't know where that goes like what are they using it for it doesn't  really say cell phone customers gripe that there's no justification for some of the fees such as the 
[03:33:00]  state's dollar 20 per line per month 9-1-1 charge we pay that i guess so wait such as the state's dollar  20 per line per month so everyone's paying a dollar 20 a month just to have the opportunity to call 9-1-1  right you should get a refund every month you don't call it yeah no kidding responding to  complaints that only a tiny amount of the tax went to 9-1-1 service the legislature voted this  month to call it a public service fee instead so fucking assholes exactly just stick it to you 
[03:33:30]  wherever they can speaking of which tax day i haven't talked about taxes yet it's tomorrow  there's still a broadcast from from the post office i miss clown guy at this point  clown guy i miss clown guy just clown guy joan gacy you wouldn't want to turn me on a clown guy  clown guy tax clown guy  clown guy behind the strip club used to do our taxes oh the guy that liked the clown statue he would 
[03:34:00]  collect clowns and then he would put the clown nose on as he's telling you how much you owe  anthony what do you get me involved with no believe me  i don't know it was a guy that used to go to the strip club or something said he was going to do taxes  i worked for a few years a while ago good old clown guy now i got envelopes that go up to the ceiling 
[03:34:30]  i got stacks of them what happened to one here i got it what happened to the easy for i remember  doing the easy that just the easy now there's uh now there's uh the the guy that i pay to do the  taxes did you get his bill wow jesus christ i hope that's deductible that was our first year in radio  that salary that guy uh yeah he rakes it in yeah and then it's it gets more confusing and and they 
[03:35:00]  prepared for you but the instruction sheet that comes with our taxes i pitch every year and bob  thinks i'm crazy i know i'm crazy but he's like why can't you figure this out i'm like because we're  because we're not tax guys it's all out and i read it and i just go wait a minute which one's got to  be signed on the fifth page and then this foot sent to kansas city right and then that get what  you get the one where the addresses are different yeah the addresses are different he says send this  to this but the envelope the envelope is addressed to somewhere else yeah i was like what but i'm 
[03:35:30]  stressing out about this and then i gotta send my vouchers send in your vouchers do that too yeah those  little thin strips tomorrow oh yeah you better get on that real for reals yo oh shit the vouchers  you got a city tax too right oh god i do cool and i gotta pay my school taxes all right guys yeah oh 
[03:36:00]  uncle paul but but for the but for the people out there they pay taxes once a year we're lucky enough  to play uh to pay what four times a year yes like that four times we go through this every three  months and then that doesn't count property and school tax in the suburbs there which um i get to  pay uh twice a year too and all those going up and then they're throwing more taxes on and then the  money you get to keep after the tax uh whenever you try to spend it it's taxed right which is something 
[03:36:30]  that i will never understand uh matt philly opa you support obama so shut the fuck up and enjoy  all the new taxes if you voted for obama you have no right to complain i did not vote for obama did i  like obama better than mccain absolutely but in general i don't really uh enjoy government thank you  i like anarchy myself i'm a i'm a less government guy i don't i don't rah-rah either one of these guys  did i like one a little better yes yes you gotta pay your taxes so that the people that don't pay 
[03:37:00]  taxes could get their checks they're gonna get their big their big check and i never bitched about  the amount of taxes i was paying i i'm bitching more about i'm bitching more about how it's a major  hassle to try to figure this out i would rather just write a check and go here just do do all the  paperwork you know they keep it that confusing so you can't figure it out right  if you could figure it out and really thought about it there'd be a revolution so they keep 
[03:37:30]  it so confusing what happened fantastic uh just getting distracted by one of our many televisions  our dozen tvs but you watch that one i'll watch this one apparently uh maury is showing some shocking  videos and there's a funeral going on somebody went up to the casket to go you know say goodbye to that  loved one and knocked a big candle over into the coffin oh my god is that i thought that was a  soundboard no it was a coffin with a corpse in it and and lit the whole thing on fire so quick to 
[03:38:00]  fucking put the fire out yeah the guy don't hurt what are you gonna get a pulse that's the worst  thing that happened yeah all right so taxes there you go yeah yeah there's a tax break  gonna make believe we pound you more make believe we play tax man after this because that's what rock  stations oh we're gonna be playing that for you all day i think we're running out of stuff to talk  about what we could go back down that old big tit baldy big tits baloney tits is such a funny word  hey peter boil tits
