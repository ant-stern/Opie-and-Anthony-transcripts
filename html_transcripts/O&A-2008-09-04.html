<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with extensive commentary on the Republican National Convention, focusing heavily on Sarah Palin’s vice-presidential nomination speech and its reception.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, offered crude and humorous commentary on Palin's appearance, personality, and family life, including jokes about her daughter’s teenage pregnancy.  They also discussed John McCain, Joe Biden, and the media's coverage of the convention, including observations about the camera operators seemingly highlighting black audience members.  Audio clips from Palin's speech were played. The hosts interspersed their political commentary with discussion of a workplace altercation involving producer Roland, who was involved in a physical fight after being playfully teased by a coworker, with JBL, a wrestler guest, earlier participating in the teasing.  Anthony made an offensive comment about a product being advertised, leading to a brief discussion with the show’s lawyers about the boundaries of on-air content.  A listener, Rocko, called in, and the hosts promised a future segment detailing the Roland incident and Anthony’s inappropriate remark.  The upcoming appearances of adult film actresses, necessitated by an advertiser, were also mentioned briefly.

The show then shifted to Anthony’s personal life, detailing his recent breakup with his girlfriend, Keith, and lamenting his siblings’ preoccupation with their families. This led to a humorous bit about Anthony’s search for new siblings, outlining a curriculum involving binge drinking and firearms.  He extensively promoted his plan for a 24/7 webcam show featuring himself and six to eight women living in his "magical mansion," emphasizing the potential for unscripted chaos, parties, and even the presence of firearms.  A caller expressed interest in participating.  Later in the show,  in-studio guests Bobby Kelly and comedian Jeffrey Ross joined the conversation. Ross discussed his experience on *Dancing with the Stars*, sharing anecdotes about his partner and challenges, including a suggestive encounter with Cloris Leachman.  The discussion returned to Anthony’s webcam idea before the segment ended.

Further discussion about *Dancing with the Stars* followed, focusing on celebrity contestants like Warren Sapp, two unnamed female Olympians, Lance Bass, Cloris Leachman, Susan Lucci, and Tony Braxton. Jeffrey Ross continued to provide details about his experience, including his Vegas odds of winning the competition and his relationship with his dance partner, Edita. Anthony's webcam plan was revisited, with humorous speculation on its legal and logistical aspects.  The segment concluded with a mix of news items, including commentary on Sarah Palin and John McCain's physical attributes and speculation about their sex lives, and other political figures.  The hosts made several off-color jokes and sexually suggestive comments. A brief, apologetic call from "Homeless Charlie," previously responsible for a network suspension, was included.  The segment ended with more discussion of Anthony's webcam plan and potential guest appearances.

A subsequent segment centered on the Showtime documentary *Cocaine Cowboys*, sparking anecdotes about the drug trade, including exaggerated jokes about fish speed after consuming discarded cocaine.  A debate about joke originality ensued between Opie and Anthony.  The conversation transitioned to John Stewart's criticism of Sarah Palin, leading to a broader discussion about perceived hypocrisy in political discourse.  Listener calls followed, including one from Kelly, who shared the recent death of her father and the discovery of Nazi memorabilia in his belongings, prompting Anthony to offer to purchase the items.  Anthony’s planned internet reality show, described as featuring “hot drunk sluts,” guns, and alcohol, was again promoted.  This segment dramatically shifted to chaos when producer E-Rock defecated on the studio floor, resulting in a physical altercation, injuries (broken ribs and a hand), extensive cleanup, and further bizarre behavior involving smearing of feces.  A caller criticized the excessive commercial breaks, a complaint the hosts refuted.  The hosts also discussed their and guests' tattoos.

The final segment chronicled a series of chaotic events involving Eastside Dave, Eric (E-Rock), and Bobby Kelly.  This included Dave defecating in his pants (which he had warned about), triggering Bobby Kelly’s repeated vomiting.  Dave’s actions were praised by the hosts.  A series of increasingly bizarre challenges for Eric followed, culminating in a physical altercation and Eric reluctantly smelling a food item, suspected to be pizza, from a garbage bag.  The segment heavily involved references to bodily functions and included discussion of injuries and monetary rewards for performing acts involving feces.  Upcoming events like Jim Norton's Boston performance and a party at Anthony's house were promoted. The hosts repeatedly mentioned "runner-up line of the day" contenders using highly vulgar and offensive language. The final moments were filled with vulgar, erratic statements and seemingly nonsensical dialogue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Good morning.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  I had such a fun drive in listening to yesterday's program. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Nothing more fun than just listening to Voss be disassembled by, I don't know, five people.  By everyone.  By everyone.  Did we have the Roland clip for today?  Roland was great.  We're going to have that, right?  Oh, did he just destroy?  I was listening to the replay on the way in and just laughing my ass off.  Soft-spoken Roland.  Yeah, Roland's really dangerous.  You get under his skin and he is a very dangerous man, right? 
[00:01:00]  He's a schizo.  Yeah.  We got to get that audio.  There's going to be a lot of curses, but we got to replay it over here.  Just amazing.  Roland's one of those mild-mannered guys that he could be on the bus just sitting there  and then the next thing you know he's sawing someone's head off and eating their face.  Like, that's Roland.  Most likely to saw someone's head off.  I think you're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think you're right on that one.  Oh, he's too much.  It's always the one you don't suspect, right?  Yeah, because he's, you know, easygoing. 
[00:01:30]  He's very, you know, we know Roland and I've known him for quite a while.  It's just, hey, yeah, movie opening Friday-wide.  But then when you say something bad about him, oof.  Yeah.  He's just, he's like the Hulk.  His eyes start spitting.  Yeah, it turns green.  Yeah.  And then just goes ballistic.  Unleashes.  Well, here we are.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Sarah Palin, or Palin, was on last night and it was too late for me.  I had to go to bed.  Oof. 
[00:02:00]  So I did a little YouTubing this morning.  Yeah.  And, man, she got the job done last night.  Now I'm thinking I should vote for McCain.  Yeah, you think?  I don't know.  Based on the vice president.  You know what, though?  She is bringing some heat because, you know, it's not even about McCain.  Yeah.  They were just all there.  They just want to see her.  They're using her to go after Obama.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's usually the tactic that they use.  They get a vice presidential candidate and they're like the pit bull.  And then the presidential candidate can sit there and talk about maybe the issues and things like that. 
[00:02:30]  He doesn't really want to acknowledge his opponent.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to really acknowledge.  You don't want to be too negative directly as you're giving a speech like that.  But the vice presidential candidate, they could go all out.  And she just, she must be a bitch to argue with at home.  I was thinking that, too.  Oh, God, a poor husband.  But I just want to go out with the guys and we're going to play some cards and stuff.  And she goes into a 20-minute speech on why he can't.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  These conventions are really funny because last week it was all about the Democrats and I was rah, rah, Obama, change.  Yes, I'm with you.  Come on, bro.  Now this week I'm like, wow, who's this broad?  I think I've got to vote for McCain now.  I've got to tell you one thing I'm just really getting a little sick of is the hand-holding between the hockey guy,  the high school hockey player, and the 17-year-old daughter of questionable moral values because they're constantly embracing and holding hands. 
[00:03:30]  And you know it's choreographed.  You know they're like, look, you too.  You're in love.  Here's the strategy we're going to use with you, too.  You're in love.  I know you just banged her, but, you know.  But they've been blessed with a new grandchild, didn't you hear?  That's the way they're looking at it.  Yes, blessed.  Yeah.  When our daughter came to us with the wonderful announcement that we will be grandparents. 
[00:04:00]  Before she graduates high school.  And unmarried to a hockey player that has said he doesn't want children.  We were so happy.  Are you?  We are blessed.  You're not blessed.  The only thing worse is if she came home with Obama.  That would be the only thing worse.  Well, we said we think the men in black got a hold of that kid and told him how it's going to be. 
[00:04:30]  Here's how it is.  Your life is not yours anymore.  It's the government's.  We own your life.  And this is what you need to do.  It's true.  Everything.  You know they sat that guy down and just said, here it is.  No drinking and driving.  No drinking.  No hanging out with your dopey, drunken Alaskan friends.  Kiss your silly hockey dream goodbye.  Bye-bye.  Enough with the dumb hockey. 
[00:05:00]  Get a blue-collar job because that looks good.  Get everything offline.  No, we'll take care of it.  Don't add anything new.  We're the government.  We got a couple of buttons in the back room we'll push and you'll disappear off the internet.  That's right.  You know people on the internet, like since 1995, there's still things on there.  They press a button, every trace of him gone.  They want this guy showering in oil.  That's it.  For photo ops.  You're done.  We just want pictures of you just dripping with oil.  Holding hands with a little, what's her name, Brittany? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  Bristol.  What?  Bristol.  Bristol.  Bristol.  I call her the goer.  Yeah.  Row.  So, you saw the speech?  I saw some of it.  Yeah, it's one of those things I was just like, eh.  Well, it's a rah-rah thing.  Look at a clip.  You know, like we said last week when the Democrats were doing the same thing, this is a glimpse  of communism.  Oh. 
[00:06:00]  What?  Really?  Communism?  Yes.  The Democrats.  No, now the Republicans, this is their turn to give us a glimpse of communism.  Whether you agree or disagree, it's just one look.  You don't get the other side to say, hey, you know, whether they can defend what she said  or not.  You don't get that this week.  You get just rah-rah-rah.  Yeah, well, that's where the attention is.  That's where the attention is.  They do go to Obama every so often and Biden, but they're not like the stars. 
[00:06:30]  He was on the news earlier.  I think he was in front of a small group of people, one of those town hall type things,  and he was bitching about something with the Republicans.  Oh, how they weren't talking about the economy.  The economy is the important thing.  And during their speeches, not one mention of the economy.  And he's like, you know, people, they don't understand the hardships people are going through.  That was his thing as he walks around with his shirt sleeves rolled up like he's going  to change spark plugs. 
[00:07:00]  Well, he's getting ready to work.  That's the look of the guy.  That's the look of the guy that's getting ready to work.  Never understood that.  The politician.  Why is a politician rolling his sleeves up?  What is he protecting his sleeves from?  Baby vomit as they pick him up and kiss him?  Yeah.  That old gag?  This whole thing is a crock of S.  You do know that.  It's just crap.  Whether you go for Obama or McCain, it's just BS in the end.  I'll tell you, though, I'd rather have a broad vice president. 
[00:07:30]  I think we'll go for that.  And she's the S coming out of his mouth.  Oh, his mouth.  Okay.  I thought someone says I was having some S coming out of my mouth.  Yeah.  It's going to be one of those situations where it's just like, all right, the black guy or  the white woman.  Even though she's not going for the presidency.  No, no.  But all the attention's on her.  That's what this is coming down to.  Yeah.  All the attention's on her.  No one will care about her once the election happens. 
[00:08:00]  Cheney was there.  Gore was there.  But it's the president.  It's all about McCain.  I think the press will keep more of an eye on her, though.  Maybe.  Because, you know, first woman.  I think they will.  Yeah.  It was pretty funny to see McCain when she came out on stage.  McCain tried to put his arm around her, and he can't lift his arm up, so it was almost  like he was patting her on the ass.  Because his arm doesn't go up that high.  Like, oh, nice.  We got a couple highlights from Sarah's speech. 
[00:08:30]  Let's just call her Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  And she put her hair down.  She lives on Florida Street.  Bill.  She put her hair down a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  It was the in-between.  The up-do and the down-do.  It was kind of in-between.  The back was down, and the front was sort of up, right?  We need her to go all in, though.  The down-do?  What'd she have?  Okay, we get it.  Well, she's got to go all in, though.  That hair's got to be completely down. 
[00:09:00]  The glasses have to come off.  Pigtails, I say.  And the blouse has to be unbuttoned.  A couple more buttons, and I think it's a landslide victory for Mr. McCain.  It's a go.  He does seem more accessible than Obama, though, for some reason.  Like, he seems more...  Obama just seems like a rock star.  He does seem like he's inaccessible.  None of that...  That's not the image he was trying to portray, I don't think.  Obama, yeah.  He also seems like he's being very guided by the Democratic Party at this point. 
[00:09:30]  Like, Obama is...  I wouldn't go as far as to say a puppet, but I think he's being advised on every single  thing he does now, and it comes across that way.  Kind of a phony thing.  Whereas McCain looks like he's just kind of doing and saying what he wants for the country.  I could be wrong.  Who am I?  Anyone else notice that they were really trying to find black people in the audience last night?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:10:00]  They do that in every Republican convention, though.  They zoom in on, like, a black guy.  I felt like I was watching Cloverfield all over again.  The cameraman's just trying to find a black person.  And I'm getting...  Getting woozy.  I'm getting motion sick at home because the camera's just like...  You know the director's like, just find a black person.  Come on.  Find him applauding.  This will be a great visual for everybody at home.  I think they found three or four black people in the audience.  And her names...  The names of her kids...  I mean, alternative names are all the rage, but... 
[00:10:30]  Track, Bristol, Willow, Piper, Trigg.  Hmm.  Yuck.  Pipe?  Piper.  Piper.  Piper.  Oh, okay.  Here's Sarah Palin, or Palin, from last night.  Mr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens, I will be honored to accept your nomination  for Vice President of the United States.  Well, you gotta make it official, right? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  How funny would that be if, like...  They go, no, it's not you.  Right.  It's Romney.  Get out of here.  Hey, Romney was pretty impressive last night.  Another pit bull.  He went in there and...  Romney should have been the Vice President.  And Giuliani went in there.  He's a much stronger individual.  He ripped apart Obama and Biden.  That was their job.  All the speakers last night just came in there and started ripping them apart.  And, yeah, pretty impressive.  Would it be funny if Mitt Romney was the choice that he came out and he goes, 
[00:11:30]  Do you really think we'd ask a broad?  Did all that happen?  Yeah!  Everyone starts clapping.  Like that scene in Trading Places in the bathroom?  Yeah.  Oh, God!  Beat it, hockey mom.  Do we keep him on?  No!  Right.  Let on...  Yeah.  Yeah.  In Trading Places, that scene's really funny.  Yeah.  It's like, this is a comedy?  They walk...  I love those hockey moms.  You know, they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? 
[00:12:00]  Lipstick.  Boo!  Ew.  Lipstick.  I'll tell you some more differences between a hockey mom and a pit bull.  You don't have to put oven mitts on a hockey mom from ripping your sides up.  Occasionally, a hockey mom will do it without peanut butter.  Exactly.  Jewelry for a hockey mom.  Kind of hacky going for that line, huh?  Yeah.  The women must love her. 
[00:12:30]  It really is something that...  Do you think the women voters are just loving her?  That she's not getting beaten up, which I think...  I think she's getting beat up in the media.  No, the media's concentrating more on the personal issue, the family, the daughter, which...  When a push comes to shove, if I may say, it really doesn't matter.  It doesn't.  And I don't think people will really vote on that.  And they're having a hard time really finding a way to lay into her, figuratively speaking, 
[00:13:00]  and make her look bad.  You know, without looking like they're beating up on a woman.  This is a weird new thing that's kind of difficult, I think, for the Democrats.  They don't know what to do.  Is Biden supposed to go in there and call it a C-word?  You know?  I mean, he's got to be tough.  She could be tough on the guys, but it's kind of hard for the guys to come back and  be tough on her without looking like they're being misogynistic or something. 
[00:13:30]  I think the debate, the vice presidential debate, should be on pay-per-view, because...  Yeah, that'll be a little loop.  If you know anything about Biden, he's not shy to speak his mind.  No, he'll say something.  And he could get a little crazy during that whole debate.  The first thing...  Is that trout I smell?  Ha, ha, ha, little joke.  There's a woman over there.  Just dropped jaws and wide-open eyeballs in the audience. 
[00:14:00]  There's a woman over there.  Ha, ha, ha, over there.  Well, that's...  Like, he'd have to explain the joke.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I did.  But that's a big funny picture of Biden.  He has to explain it.  See?  Like, not his head to the left.  Oh, that's what you mean.  We thought there really was fish in the room, but no, it's just...  No, it's a...  As a close-up and she's going over some of her...  ...maybe her platform, he just starts lobbing tampons at her.  why don't we uh continue here she goes after uh obama here we've all heard his dramatic speeches 
[00:14:30]  before devoted followers and there is much to like and admire about our opponents  but listening to him speak it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs  but not a single major law or even a reform oh ouch not even in the state senate no she didn't yeah 
[00:15:00]  nothing  this is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars america is fighting  and never use the word victory except when he's talking about his own campaign  oh damn oh snap campaign campaign the voice is a little rough right it's the car the tan sierra 
[00:15:30]  yeah it's a bit fargo-ish yeah a bit uh mars attack-ish no not near what hillary is hillary right  yeah they said that uh i was reading the paper they said that some of her stuff like her she was  talking about some attack on something let's see like some of the foreign policy stuff seems a little  contrived like she yeah like i we should attack that didn't she talk about attacking some facility  it's like it's like saudi arabia stop it i mean i don't even know that yeah yeah your job is to  just talk about how you're a proud mommy yeah yeah don't worry about it there proud mom of four 
[00:16:00]  children let mccain do all the heavy lifting even though he can't really lift his hands above his  hips but he's gonna do some heavy lifting anyway yeah you're a proud hockey mom that is your role  here that did that did a couple cute things in alaska as mayor yeah it's alaska no one pays  attention to alaska well look it's the six month in a row uh potato uh festival yeah we know no light 
[00:16:30]  right right it's dark up there we know you know now she's gonna like attack sony arabia let's slow  down a little bit stop you're still in a minivan let's relax you're not in a jaguar yet you're from a  place where you wear sunglasses at two in the morning yeah exactly she did let her hair down  a little though a little bit more in the back she's still got kind of a bun swirly thing going  she's gotta get rid of that i think yeah she's gotta let that hair loose and cleavage is all the  contact all the rage a little cleavage would help too yeah in politics there are some candidates who use 
[00:17:00]  change to promote their careers and then there are those like john mccain who use their careers to  promote change  uh steven s for bayshore writes uh well he's got what biden would say during the vice presidential  debate oh as biden listen toots don't get extra chromosomes all over that microphone other people 
[00:17:30]  have to use that later how all right and finally uh i think we'll have all the clips from the 40  plus minute speech that she did last night but here's one more one more one more soundbite for now  uh come on but when the what jimmy what uh nah sometimes no sometimes you just gotta step back 
[00:18:00]  let the pitch go by all right but when the cloud of rhetoric has passed when the roar of the crowd  fades away when the stadium lights go out and those styrofoam greek columns are hauled back to  some studio lot  nice  when that happens what exactly is our opponent's plan what does he actually seek to accomplish 
[00:18:30]  after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet  oh wow wow  he's going in nails first he's biting kicking scratching  bitch fight  love it  oh how obama kills her in the next speech  he probably will

[00:27:00]  cowhead  is that the guy  in tampa  no that was a  different one  exactly he does  sound a lot like  bubba the lost  one  dude  they all have  that affected  voice  let me tell  you something  call up the  election  call up the  mary and have  him send some  food over  sorry we're going  inside for everybody  today  i know  i know you  don't and i  apologize  don't worry  your name is  rocko  when you do a  radio show  you're supposed  to bring as  many people as  humanly possible  into your  conversation but  every once in 
[00:27:30]  a while we like  to do something  for ourselves  ah yeah  yes jim  i like to talk  to a picture  of the listener  shut up  i like to have  a photo  of the listener  just sitting there  in front of you  that way you know  who you're addressing  yes i talk to  that person  yeah  we're all just  raising mccain  you're out of  my way  maybe we should  get some more  lyrics for that  song i'm thinking  what do you got  rocko  we can sing here  well two things  actually  mccain is starting 
[00:28:00]  to look more and  more like dr evil  the way he's  walking around  and i also  noticed that  it's actually  very smart that  he's actually  using a lot of  the southern rock  or the southern  stars because  anybody's going to  win a southern  state in this  election it seems  like they're going  to be the ones  that are going  to take the  election itself  obama's not  going to win  many southern  states  i don't think  he is he's  going to you  know i don't  think he's not  winning alabama  or louisiana  he's going to  get a couple  sure well  miss mississippi  popular in california  they'll get a few  yeah but you know 
[00:28:30]  the country song  is always the  republican thing  oh yeah  obama is seen  as the guy  even though he  might not be  but everyone's  blaming he's  mccain's problem  is he's too  linked to bush  it's like just  because i'm saying  just by being  uh an old guy  republican it's  it's hard to not  be connected  just because you're  in the same party  i kind of like  the uh idea  that uh he  picked biden  because all this  change he's talking  about and it's  business as usual  he picks one of  the most you know  business as usual  guys they say 
[00:29:00]  biden though is  it true i think  someone told me he's  worth like maybe  it was microsoft  he's less than  two hundred thousand  dollars he's not  worth that much  money like he  really never got  rich from politics  no well none of  these guys get rich  from politics it's  what they're doing  on the side  making afterwards  and yeah what  they do on the  side investments  oil  what does the  president make  officially  it was two  hundred thousand  it's four hundred  thousand and the  big stink on biden  is his kid who's a  huge lobbyist for  the credit card  companies and the  kids making big  money off the 
[00:29:30]  credit card lobby  which biden voted  for and obama voted  against  ah gotta keep his  kid in cash  what's the credit  card lobby you want  to do i mean you  you charge something  you try to pay it  off so you don't  get rate fifty percent  uh interest they  want there was an  effort to change the  bankruptcy laws which  would have protected a  lot of people who  wanted to file bankruptcy  and expunge their  debts and biden uh  supported the credit  card companies and  said wait a minute  wait a minute and  obama was all for it  and biden's kid was  like the lead guy 
[00:30:00]  was he for or  against it uh  biden he was for  he was against he  was in favor of the  credit card companies  and against changing  the bankruptcy laws  so wait so what  biden was saying was  you'll have to pay  your credit card bills  exactly  can't really fault  them for that  well hey your  credit card bills  yeah it does make  sense but the kid  was kids pockets are  lined with all this  credit card money  that's fine i mean but  the credit card  company let's be honest  if they all died in a  flash flood no one  would mind no but if  you charge something and 
[00:30:30]  you should pay for it  well i i heard a  commercial on uh the  news on the way in and  it was for one of those  debt relief companies  that come in and help  you out if you've  gotten into credit  card debt and they're  like don't let the  credit card companies  take you it's like  wait but you chalked  it up and it's and  they're making it sound  like it's you'll win  one against the credit  card companies do you  think they just eat it  and go oh well no the  interest rates go up for  the people that actually  pay their effing credit  card bills and the  service charges and the 
[00:31:00]  the yearly uh fees for  things like american  express they go up  because people don't  pay their credit card  bills credit cards are  great like i don't have  enough money but i want  that well here you go  yeah yeah that seems to  be how people use them  but that's the fun part  of them i know how did  they get that done back  in the day it's like i  don't have this money but  i could just give you this  little plastic card and i  could get this all right  amazing because you have  to pay interest on i think  they charge way too much  but it's like how could  you expect them just to  go all right here go get 
[00:31:30]  this that you can't  afford we'll foot the bill  and you pay us back no  interest no advantage to  us we're the nice guy's  company we just give you  money for no reason it  doesn't make sense yeah  i pay it off every month  like just but you know  what you can afford to  charge yeah if you can  pay it over a month do it  so you don't have to pay  them any interest they  hate that yeah they  really do they hate it  yeah they're not fans of  that whatsoever no they  always try to get me to  delay they always get me  yeah they hate getting  their money from you  immediately i gotta tell 
[00:32:00]  one time i i used to  use credit cards for  prostitutes which i would  never do it many many  years ago i would never  do it again and i got a  bill one time they  overcharged me by ten  thousand dollars i think  it was a ten thousand  dollar fraud and one time  was like six that was  like sixteen thousand  dollars what a surprise  you think they'd be so  reputable and uh no you  don't oh yes sir  literal jimmy literal jim  no they uh i couldn't  believe i was so scared  because back then i mean i  would now i'd be scared  back then i was mortified 
[00:32:30]  uh they they they didn't  charge me for it had to  take care of it i yeah i  went to a prostitute i  think well he's not  married with kids so he  could just do that i think  i did say i think that's  why they do it because  they assume they're gonna  get a few husbands that  are gonna be paranoid and  go i'll just i'll just  take the hit i'm gonna  i'm gonna i'm gonna i  got an escort and they  over this is what they  did i think i spit it  right out yeah i believe  so all right hey uh a  rod had a terrific game  last night jimmy just  want to let you know did  he really what did he go  one for eight i hit a  double in the fourth  hit a monster home run 
[00:33:00]  when it didn't matter  last night that's great  for your yankees so but  it uh did bring out the  first um instant replay  yeah very exciting for  baseball viewing because  they didn't know they  didn't know it's brand  new replay system for the  first time and the  yankees alex rodriguez  found himself smack dab in  the middle of the historic  event there's probably 800  players in the big leagues  the odds of me being in  some controversy was  probably two to one  rodriguez hit a ninth  inning homer in the  yankees 8-4 win over  tab of course he did  it bounced off the cat 
[00:33:30]  walk near the left field  foul pole after his  catcher protested race  manager joe madden came  out of the dugout to  question the call that  sent the umps off the  field to look at the  video two minutes 15  seconds later they came  back and upheld the  homer i thought they  handled it handled it in  a very good way i don't  even i still don't know  if it was fair or  thought i don't know if  it was conclusive or not  but nevertheless they  went through the process  did not take that long  umpire crew chief joe  reliford said after the  game all four umpires  decided the ball was fair  before having a look at  replay but decided to  break out the new 
[00:34:00]  technology that was in  place to be sure they  were but the guy that  gave up the homer wasn't  i thought it was clearly  fair but after looking  for replay i wouldn't  have known what to  call it to be honest  with you  yeah whatever  pretty much whatever  stuff  what's it we were just  watching that uh on the  television as you were  listening to that audio  and uh what umps are  all just fat bastards  is that is that a  prerequisite you have to  be in the worst shape 
[00:34:30]  anyone can possibly be in  to be an umpire in the  major league they also  have some padding on  padding yeah did you see  that guy that walked out  there was one guy his  belly what i don't know  what that is maybe it's a  defense so the uh the  uh managers can't come up  and get right in their face  anymore and just mess with  them yeah yeah you're  not gonna push the umps  around i don't know  britney's gonna open up  the vmas again this year  i'm sorry to jump in with  that like 13 year old  girl news wow she was  said no she wasn't gonna  do it now she's doing it  i guess who cares oh it 
[00:35:00]  could be a disaster in the  making please yeah that's  true what could she  possibly she'll probably  be great this year  she's uh yeah she's way  better than she was last  year so it's not gonna be  she's not gonna she's not  gonna mess it up uh two  years in a row the word is  she's not gonna perform  she's just gonna come out  and open it up and say  hey hey hey oh the  ceremony accent hey  y'all hi well i'm back  shut up did you miss me  no michael jackson may show  up i'm sure they give him 
[00:35:30]  a big hand yeah you know  that he turned 50 and no  one cared he used to be  like the biggest star in  the world turn 50 is like  a that's an album uh thriller  thriller i believe uh big  album i think it's uh sold  uh maybe 100 200 copies  hey uh heading toward a  break but yesterday we had  quite a moment that we want  to replay for everybody uh  roland who's very soft 
[00:36:00]  spoken he uh he books the  guests for our fine radio  show uh when when you  tickle him he has the the the  most innocent laugh you'll  ever hear the giggle opie it's  a giggle he's adorable when  you tickle him right a  little uh tee hee hee like  the pillsbury dough boy and  uh i think roland got picked  on when he was growing up  and it manifested itself  somewhere in his brain and  he does not allow that to  happen now that he's an  adult he snaps he snaps right 
[00:36:30]  and we we learned uh one day  out of nowhere somebody was  making fun of him and wow  evil roland came out no  master poe what happened was  master poe was tickling him but  he tickled him too hard like  like like you know you get  tickled like when you someone  digs their fingers and he  master poe didn't mean to  he's master poe just you know  being so heavy-handed he's a  heavy-handed goon but poor  roland he put roland on the  ground was tickling him hard  and i think roland felt like  he was being like bullied yeah  and roland just jumped up and  threw a bottle of water at  it roland snapped and uh he 
[00:37:00]  doesn't like you know roland's  a heavy boy he's there's a he's  a big boy roland's a big boy  he doesn't like being he doesn't  like fat jokes or mean-spirited  fat jokes and voss learned the  hard way that he shouldn't have  hit roland like that leave him  alone because they were so  toxic yesterday yeah and then  we went over to xm and it was  even because jbl the big wrestler  came in oh yeah bigly it was  just douching him and then he was  douching mike and then everyone  just attacked rich rich was like 
[00:37:30]  in an old-school kung fu movie  where they just keep coming and  coming and coming at him yeah and  he's fighting off everybody as as  best he can and he finally loses  because it's you know one against  a hundred it was just too much for  him and we also got to get the  clip of anthony just uh putting his  old uh his foot in his mouth with  that jbl that was hilarious well we  got to get that to it for after the  break that was hilarious guy comes in  to promote a product and anthony no  he's coming in to promote a product  and wanted to know what this s this f 
[00:38:00]  wait this oh i just you just i  insulted his his beverage having no  idea that this product was in front  of you because jbl was coming in to  promote it i was questioning the  sexuality of maybe a man that would  drink something in a can of that  color yeah and um i also said uh what  is this and i used another word for  crap yeah well we'll get that for  after the break but first so uh  here's roland snapping rich voss  goes after him with an innocent 
[00:38:30]  little uh chubb joke and roland  wasn't going to have any of it  roland is um i want you to try  roland books a lot of our guests  he's a very uh sweaty guy i want  you to try what do you think  all right he's trying the drink he  does the typical i don't think he  needs anything to slow him down  though all right oh jesus was a  rich no you're a  calm guy i'm just saying you don't  anything that's all you know you  don't want to get you don't want to

[00:40:30]  yeah  and he did it really well  he had a great exit and everything  that was like a wrestling move  he had the  it's delicious though  the energy drink closer was like a hack road move  that was good  it was like  he was doing a little talk up thing  this is very good jbl  and then he goes back to normal rolling  in the end  this is very good jbl  jbl  it's a good product  i like it  what you couldn't see is  one of the things that got a huge laugh was roland  let's just say held the can a certain way  and shook it up and the can sprayed all over 
[00:41:00]  oh yeah yeah  and that was kind of like a here you go rich  yeah  he goes oh yeah i'm rich i'm rich  making like he's um  taking care of business with the can  and it's sprayed all over the place  i just caught by the way  i listened to it  where he's going make it count  roland's yelling  make it count  oh cause  yeah  make it count  boss likes to brag that he's been doing our show for eight years  and roland is basically saying well great but make it count  opie and anthony we'll be right back  rolling right along it's the opie and anthony show 
[00:41:30]  look who stopped by to say hi  it's bobby  hi bobby  hi opie how are you anthony  hey bobby should have been here yesterday  yeah i heard there was  oh it's just a pile on boss  there was some hijinks  it was really great  it's fair to say though  i mean boss held his own  yeah  oh he did yeah yeah  mike took some abuse  well that's for sure  we said that he beat up mike  for bigly a pretty good  yeah  uh roland kicked uh  boss's ass  this is for the people that were keeping score at home  and then jbl beat him in a uh 
[00:42:00]  a split decision  yeah so  you know boss did all right  jbl had some great lines though  it was really funny  when he when he said something like  are you funny on stage  he just kept hammering  yesterday's show was a highlight reel  that one's uh one for the ages man  jbl was great  because he just kind of came in and hung  and just did what the show  dumped on people and got dumped on  yeah and just through talking  we were able to promote his stuff  you know  we didn't have to sit there  and just plug it like uh  no 
[00:42:30]  you know like here he is  with his product  it was funny  he's a he's a fun guy to have on  we did it our way  and you had a fine faux pas  that they're getting uh  oops  together in the the office  yeah  bobby so jbl  he has this  he has a drink  some kind of anti-energy drink  right  and he's about to do our radio show  so the guys  you know they're well prepared  behind the scenes  they decide  if you're going to be talking about  this energy drink  with jbl  who's about to enter the studio  the boys should have the drink  in front of him  so we all have this like uh 
[00:43:00]  purple can of uh  of uh  delicious  rank  of goodness  yeah i was trying to avoid  the uh  the name of the product  because they get a panicky  down the hall  oh my god  you just gave him a free  a free plug  tell him what it is  yeah it's called drank  it's an anti-energy drink  and it comes in a  good too  in a weird purplish can  it's called drank  it's supposed to mellow you out  instead of like you know  get you like a red bull  or something like that  it's called milk  yeah  it wasn't  the cool color purple  the can  like pants 
[00:43:30]  it was kind of the swishy  color purple  yeah  and anthony uh  well you know  in my defense  i was trying to get  the um  palto camera  focused on the  scrabble board  because jimmy and um  jimmy and voss  were playing scrabble  at the time  well because  nothing says  great radio  like scrabble  so i wanted to get  the scrabble board  on the palto camera  but the  the can was in the way  yeah  so i said  can someone move that  and then i started thinking  what the hell is it  like it's all over the place  it's in this purple can 
[00:44:00]  so i might have  said something  to the effect that  the color of the can  uh  might make it popular  with certain  members of the gay community  and  uh  that  the product inside  was um  another word for crap  yeah  and then we said  well ladies and gentlemen  let's bring in the guy  the ceo of the company  that makes this  that's  that's the beauty  of us  the guy who puts  his life's blood  into um 
[00:44:30]  making the product  yeah  he puts his blood  in the in the back  yes  yes  it's tasty  we got the short clip  then we're gonna have  a longer version  in a in a few minutes  here but it's worth  playing right now  and that purple  what elixir that is  what what is this  yeah  the beeps really do it  justice  does it  well what are you gonna do  yeah  none of those are  gray area beeps  no  one of them is actually  yeah one of them is  yeah one certainly is  it's a normally a 
[00:45:00]  derogatory term for a  gay gentleman  don't say that  because they might call in  don't say that  that's not nice  nice  you know what the lawyers  told us yesterday  hi we're douches  exactly  that would mean they  were telling the truth  and they never do that  there's a sexpo going on  in new york city  and they uh they  they bought a lot of  advertising on this radio  show so of course  you know they want to  to bring some of these  starlets of the x-rated  variety into our uh show 
[00:45:30]  just to promote the sexpo  right  today  uh trust me listen  and and and we're like  okay sure  you know well can they  get naked  no  all right then no  no to the uh adult  entertainers sorry  no what can they do  yeah what can they do  so the lawyers got  back to us and he said  good news fellas you  can have them in as  long as they're wearing  pasties  pasties  what is this  1955  so we told the lawyers  once again go screw  sometimes when i'm doing 
[00:46:00]  the tupless  the pasties slip off  can i can  like pasties be like  pickles  can you just stick pickles  on there  they'll fall off bob  not if you bite a hole  in the middle of them  and twist them on  bite a hole in the  middle of what  pasties  that brie olsen  is so sexy  yeah  you want to see her  without pasties  so  pasties is just  they're unsexy  just takes the  sex  they're not 
[00:46:30]  yeah  it ruins everything  i especially like the  ones with tassels  so they can swing  them around  are there pasties  that are clear  yes  then we're being  idiots  no we're not  we're done with the  lawyers  i didn't think they'd  allow that  the lawyers  well let this  probably wouldn't even  allow clear ones  let sales fight it out  with the lawyers  because now they  understand what we're  going through with  these asses down  there in washington  how stupid that looks 
[00:47:00]  the fcc doesn't fine  you for having naked  women in a radio  station  studio  no  so maybe if sales  loses a little money  then maybe they jump  on board and help us  out with these  these scums that are  that are hurting our  show  you don't understand  it it's radio  you can't see it  we're not going to  sit there and vividly  describe anything  because we're not  stupid  we know  we know  what fcc  laws are  rules  believe it or not  it's just a few 
[00:47:30]  lawyers  and you know  who you are  who are just  imposing  their own  personal morality  yeah  that's all it is  and i sat across  one of them  and i said  and he said  the same thing  well you could be  getting into a  finable area  and i said  well has there  ever in the  history of radio  been a fine  associated  with a nude  breast in studio  no  well then what's  the issue  it's an impossibility  and they say  well then what's  the difference  the difference  is it's corny  and the people 
[00:48:00]  in studio  know it's fake  and if it's fake  it's ridiculous  in the audience  senses it's fake  they didn't even  want me to  because i wanted  to do something  where we said  a girl was in here  getting naked  and just really  describe a girl  taking her clothes  off and doing  something  when there's no  girl in the studio  right  and they shot  that down  yeah  they said no  you can't even  do that  radio is at a  crossword  there's an  invisible girl  and we can't  even say that  she's here  well radio  is at a  crossroads  right now  and the best 
[00:48:30]  thing that  cbs radio  could do  i'm serious  too  i have no  problem saying  this  they need  to hire  young  aggressive  lawyers  that uh  will help  you know  the talent  try to get  some of this  stuff done  without getting  fcc fines  that's what  a young buck  from a grisham  novel  yeah  these old guys  have got to go  overcome  they have got to  go  they're hurting  the product  and there's no  but there's no  fcc issue  with that  like a  girl in here  there's no  fcc issue 
[00:49:00]  whatsoever  young lawyers  that understand  what's going on  in uh  in media  in the year  2008  that's what  this company  needs  plus this is  new york city  too  it's not like  you're in the  middle of  nebraska  yes  you probably  do it in the  middle of  nebraska  yeah it's called  uh not being  on the radar  so like  these  that's our  problem  uh being a  syndicated show  we're competing  against shows  that still are  allowed to do  all this stuff  because they're  under the radar  they don't have  names for  themselves  and that's  what we try  to tell the  lawyers too  you're killing  us  you're tying  one of our  hands behind  our back 
[00:49:30]  very interesting  no guys  don't do that  because  because i'm stuck  with a woman  at home  and i can't  come in and  see the breasts  so i don't  want you to  that's all  that's all it  is  god i bet  that's all  it is  a bunch of  guys who are  stuck in suburban  life which is  great if that's  where you want  to be  i don't want  to be there  i'm filth  no one wants  to be there  you good point  you know what  playing devil's  out  i was walking  through uh  i was walking  through sheep  meadow here in  new york city  the other day  a girl sunning  herself in uh 
[00:50:00]  sheep meadow which  is a huge park  right right in  the middle of uh  central park  basically right in  the middle of  manhattan  completely topless  i forgot to tell  you guys  and guess what  that's legal  you can do that  most girls are a  little too shy to  do that but yes  it's legal to do  that and they  don't want to you  know have be  attacked by  yeah right  puerto ricans  well puerto ricans  do that but  sometimes oh bob  don't don't doll  it up you meant  it bob the racist  kelly he'll be  appearing bobby  brings up a good  point though because  it's always the ones  that uh you don't  really want to see 
[00:50:30]  yeah even though  you want to see  bad ones too because  it's like wow it's  booby yeah it  doesn't matter but  a girl with a  really nice set  you're 100%  right they're not  going to be  sunning themselves  in sheet metal  because they will  sheet metal because  they will get  attacked  some creep will do  something stupid  just come up and  give a little  right  hey honey  you up  i think it's time  to turn over  you see a bush  bushes rustling  like a like a  dinosaur is coming  yeah i saw a girl

[00:53:30]  what's wrong with you you  you have guns and video  games and a swimming pool  you're such a juvenile yeah  it happens why don't you  try having one get one no  just adopt one for a week  why are you scared of kids  anthony what why are you  scared of them they wreck  everything you don't want  to have your own you don't  want you don't want any real  relationship with your your  sister's kid or your  brother's kid no i don't  wait wait wait i didn't  say that i do because i go  over there and and you  know i do the baby thing 
[00:54:00]  where you go oh coochie  coochie you get a warm  feeling when you hold them  have you held the kids  coochie and how does it  go one more time coochie  coochie and and i no i  don't i i haven't held the  children yet i'm kind of  with you on that though i  the kids have to be six to  seven months old before i  can finally when you can  still see a pulse on top of  their head yeah i ain't  touching it that's where i  agree with you i get  scared holding newborns  i'll do it for like for  the quick photo like all  right here you go and  then i i can't really  touch them until they're  six or seven months old 
[00:54:30]  you don't want that soft  spot on top of the head  who's that uncle paul  uncle paul come right up  they love it i'll hold a  newborn you just gotta you  just gotta kind of put  that little head against  your chest and you know  they're cute they smell  like little babies yeah  until they vomit what's  that i said it looks like  a newborn oh boy they puke  on you they um yeah they  uh make uh uh wee wees i  don't want that and then  the other thing one no 
[00:55:00]  part of what's that i never  changed a diaper and i got i  got 10 nephews and nieces a  whole diaper changing thing  where they like hold the  baby up and stick their nose  right there go oh someone  needs a changing it's like is  that cute is that something  how do you do that i don't  know as a parent i saw my  brother doing that a couple  days oh that's god i actually  saw a friend of mine take  baby boop boop and wipe it  on his upper lip like a  mustache i saw that once i  forgot who that was crazy  look he wasn't even his own 
[00:55:30]  kid yeah i know it was some  retard kid that was that was  quite horrific to say the  least just took lawnmower grass  and rubbed it on your upper  lip yeah but yeah so it's just  got me a little you know did  you ever want to have kids no  was this something like early  on you just knew it wasn't  early on new there's  spontaneity ruiners first of  all like i i i like uh what if  you have a cool kid though no 
[00:56:00]  no you see the parents out  there that have the cool kid  and then the kid is not that  much of a problem if i want to  go to vegas at the drop of a  hat yeah i just got to go to  the airport with my amex and i'm  going to vegas i don't have to  pack a pack and play and find  out where the kids got to stay  and and and all this happy  crap right enough of it and  yes and it and then they just  turn into someone else like joe  now i used to go over and joe 
[00:56:30]  would be noodling around with his  guitar now he's just constantly  holding uh the baby and and  dancing around and oh look look  like oh whatever and then dawn  same thing they're just fixated  and when they go over because  usually when we see each other  it's going over mom's house and  that's where we do all hang out  sure so mom makes it even worse  because she's the doting  grandmother so uh she's over there  with the kids and i sit there 
[00:57:00]  going ah oh what about me i get no  attention anymore i'm done i'm  done what's wrong with you i don't  get any attention from my family  anymore yeah because you're 47  yeah it's time that you moved on  yeah you're at the court your  mommy doesn't feed you sauce your  mom's been wanting to be a  grandmother for probably 15 years  and it finally happened  whoopity doo maybe maybe 20 years  she probably wanted to be a grandma 
[00:57:30]  20 years ago sure she because her  brother and sister both had kids uh  you know late in life yeah i think  it's also later in life i should say  both of them had at the same time  yep so it's like all of a sudden  it's like and take this the right  way anthony's realizing that he's  basically just an overgrown five-year-old  and he doesn't and it's this relative  comparison of wow they are adults and  i really am but you know what i love  the fact that aunt doesn't want kids  and it's like he's seen as the weird  one i'm totally with you yeah you 
[00:58:00]  don't want them good like no not that  they're bad to have but if you don't  want you know weird to not want them  no go to vegas and you know and spill  a little of stuff whatever right the  thing is the only thing that makes you  see that like you're gonna be when you  get older like older than you are now  yeah uh and like your your brother and  your sister are gonna have a kid out  there who's gonna be young and gonna be  embarrassed that they're ancient parents  no he's gonna be oh that someone's gonna  be there to take care of them when you  get older because you're gonna have

[01:01:30]  let me let me explain let me explain  something to you frank there was a time  in my family's life where i was the one  that decided hey it's time to wake up and  be an adult because we were all just you  know kind of screw-ups and everything  not my sister she went to school and  and everything but it was like you know  it's time to do something an adult would  do  let me get married and then i believe  that my brother and my sister saw that 
[01:02:00]  and thought hey you know anthony did this  oh boy we're getting you know older we  might as well get married too and this i'm  getting because the whole child thing  just because my brother and sister had a  kid at the same time doesn't necessarily  mean i want to jump in there and have a  kid  because let me tell you how those three  marriages ended  oh for three in horrid  horrid divorces  the kumias are oh for three  oh for three 
[01:02:30]  oh good for you  just horrid  so i'm not gonna look at them and go  oh look  you know they've chosen to raise their  families and then i'm supposed to you know  jump on board  sorry  no it's not you're supposed to jump on  board you're just not supposed to  whine like a little kid  i'm not  i'm lonely  i didn't say i'm lonely  i want to i want to have a beer and a  joint with i just want to hang out why  wouldn't you want to hang out with your  brother  and sister who have been cool for years

[01:03:30]  doing that  it's every  every second of their existence  i i'm not even joking  it does make it tougher  it's every second  of their existence  revolves around  children now  around their kids  which is fine for them  it's very good  they're very loving parents  uh my mother is stunned  when she sees my brother  with uh the baby  because she's just like  he is  the the best father  so loving  everything like that  i'm like why  because it's not cracking the kid's head 
[01:04:00]  against the porcelain sink  what is he  what is he supposed to do  he's doting  he's doting dad  like every other father  he fell asleep  next to the bean pod  i call it  if you ever saw invasion  of the body snatchers  i did  yeah  you you  your whole life  you're going  kids screw that  it's all  i'm just hanging out  i'm getting girls  i'm doing this  i'm doing  and then you fall asleep  next to the pod  you wake up  and you tell all your friends  it's not that bad  it's  this is good  do it  but inside you're like  chasing people down the street  come on

[01:09:00]  steady  uh uh  and and i was a good boy  faithful  very  and i i you know  i was in for  for too many years  of that  and i think it's time  where if i want to go  and do something  i don't have to  make a phone call  and i don't have to do this  i could just do what i want  you don't want to answer to no one  so today  today after  after work  i'm heading to the gun store  i'm picking up another rifle  what's good  is wrong with you  that's good  dude  get him while you can  because if the democrats get in 
[01:09:30]  it's over johnny  i'll be grandfathered in with an armory  that's pretty much what i'm so  anthony make it official  because the speculation is ridiculous  anthony is officially single  just say it  and then we move on to other things  uh well  or or or whatever  but that one  yeah  what do you want to say officially  because then they can move on  i think people can figure it out  believe it or not  they can't because they're still like  well so does that mean  you know what  because they're stupid  all right good  you heard it here  figure it out  now we can move on

[01:10:30]  of course  i  so  did you have any parties yet  uh  yeah  yeah yeah  you had a big party  had a big party  yeah  and then i've been having like a smaller party  what was the big party  like a big barbecue  that would have been one that bobby should have been invited to  i don't know why bob kelly wasn't invited to  i'll tell you why  because  did keith call you  nobody called me  damn the smaller ones  but i'm blaming on keith  what about these smaller ones  who came to your party  they're just  anthony  gatherings of maybe  six 
[01:11:00]  six or so people  i'd like to come  yeah i'd like to come too  we don't  we don't drink though  you gotta be  you gotta be a drinker  you drink a little  you have a beer  i don't care about  putting a funnel down your throat  and you know  making you drink  i don't drink at all  not beer anyway  can you hang out with your friends that are a bit square  you're square  you're looking at three guys that are on the square side  as far as like the partying goes  i'd have my hog out in that jacuzzi  you did  me and norton would just be making egg drop soup 
[01:11:30]  you were going like an old man who just drank a bunch of orange juice  of course  it was a giant warm toilet  he was in a giant warm toilet  he wasn't happy with the warm jacuzzi  he wasn't happy  i had just gotten the jacuzzi done  did you go  i went  yeah  oh there was a party  oh you went  yeah  that's cool  bobby  no no no that's cool  it was a horrible oversight  yeah that's  you should have been invited  no why would i be invited dude  this was something that was a lot  let me let me tell you something  this party  was probably the most stressful thing 
[01:12:00]  yeah  since my divorce  yeah  it sounded stressful  no it sounded stressful  it was a lot of like things going on  yeah like people coming and bringing food  and having laughs  and joking around  and giggling  oh it was catered  that's cool  that relieviates a lot of the pressure  doesn't it  well  when you just pay someone to cook for you  no that's cool dude  no that's cool  no  wait wait wait  why was it stressful  well it just was  because you  god damn  got to figure out the guests  and then  get a tent  you figured out the guests  and then go to  like a price club 
[01:12:30]  kind of place  whatever the other one is  and buy all the stuff  for the party  I could have bought some  I hope I  I would have brought some  I hope I'm not  saying anything  outrageous here  but when I walked into  your pool party  I went  to myself  to no one  try to keep some of the stuff  to myself  why is Anthony vacuuming  the pool  with his hog  no I go  I go  no  I looked around  and went  wow this isn't Anthony  yeah  see thanks 
[01:13:00]  wow this isn't Anthony  it was so difficult  Anthony is a very  very casual  doesn't give a crap  about pretty much  anyone  type of person  no that's not true  I'm very caring  next thing you know  there's a cook  and there's  there's like  hot girls  with hors d'oeuvres  yeah  trays  walking around  there's a tent  there are tables  with the white cloths  on them  and everything  I've never been to a party  hold on  the presentation  it was unbelievable  but I said to myself  this is not Anthony  if Anthony was going  to just throw a pool party 
[01:13:30]  he'd be like  I don't know  Saturday 2 o'clock  come on over  we'll figure it out  that's what I'll do now  this thing was figured out  right down  oh yeah  when was it  the cocktail napkins  when was it  I think there were  fancy cocktail napkins  18th I think  something like that  oh a couple weeks ago  yeah a couple weeks ago  I remember that weekend  that was the weekend  when I was home  my girl was  I was out of town  and I was alone  and I was waking up  early and then  going back to sleep  and then waking up  and then going back to sleep  you missed a fun party  yeah  sleeping all day 
[01:14:00]  I think it was called  like depression  I don't know what it was  oh  well  let me tell you something  enough with the depression  you probably wouldn't have  had as good a time  as you would  at like  one of the smaller gatherings  it's a lot more casual  now  it's just like  it's not this thing  where people are  coming over  with platters of stuff  you just walk into the cabana  grab yourself a beer  was Voss there  go there  no and he's angry too  but  was  apparently  apparently Keith  had invited him 
[01:14:30]  twice  but he said  he wasn't invited  no Patrice wasn't invited  because  you know  my neighborhood  has restrictions  weight restrictions  I meant  yeah  with that  we really have to  take a break  alrighty  we're really late  so there you go  there's a  there's a scoop  finally on  what's going on  with Ant  Bobby  where are you going to be  Caroline's  Caroline's  Friday  two shows  8 and 10  30  and Saturday  8 and 10  30  and Sunday  this week  so Caroline's  Friday  Saturday  and Sunday  because people

[01:25:00]  but  you know  the real  the real attraction  every night  a certain girl  whatever girl you pick  should have to sleep with you  and then we get to watch  why do you want to watch him  have sex  Bobby  why do I want to watch  any guy have sex  I want to watch  Anthony have sex  I think people would  oh I would love to  I would  to see him just  get angry  have that vein  pop out in the side  of his neck  would you have sex  on the webcam  I don't know  yes you would  I might do it  under the covers  under the covers  yeah you can do it  at first  I'll be all shy

[01:26:00]  with horrible lighting  that's what he calls me  horribly lit  all choppy webcam  not enough bandwidth  they just get to see me  sit around  watching Back to the Future  for the 800th time  why do you keep  watching this  shut up  alright  give us a  give us an update  when you have one  okay  I'm in talks  you're not BSing though  you really want to try this out  yeah I'd love to  try that out  oh stage 3  has  stage 3  of Anthony's insanity 
[01:26:30]  nice  I can't wait  until he gets into  like fetishes  oh yeah  his sexual  perversion  starts coming out  trying new things  yeah you're gonna have  a dungeon  no I don't like  stuff like that  not yet  I'm more of a romantic  than a  a romantic  than a  you know  a dominatrix  lover guy  oh yeah  watch  at least that's what  they should call the show  watch Dumbbell fall in love  and break every heart  he likes me  why are my bags  at the front door  Jesus  I'm not knocking that 
[01:27:00]  you're a single guy  good for you  hey I'm not a fag  like this  being very mean to me  on Pal Talk  what are you gonna do  at night  what do you  I mean  what do you mean romantic  no no  I just said like  in my personal life  I lean more that way  than I would  you know  getting a whip out  or something like that  that does nothing for me  dominatrix  have you ever tried it  no  I see them  they come on the show  and stuff  and they try to be all  Nick you're gonna get  on all fours  and I'm like  shut up  no I'm not  you just  yeah just please 
[01:27:30]  a good dom though  who really knows  how to be a dom  again  DeLuise  it was very funny  in a few movies  a good dominatrix  you ate the oni  and who understands  how to not  be that  do that corny  dialogue with you  they are really  sexy women  a dominatrix  that is truly  a dominant woman  who's not some  neo-slave  because I'm with you  shut up  no  someone's suggesting  I choke  choke him out  every so often  or maybe  tase him  around the house  imagine just walking up 
[01:28:00]  to one's ass  and bam  you just hit her  with a taser  and she drops  how funny would that be  how mad the women's  group should be  this is like a rape show  I should call it  Anthony's Rape Castle  you should let Norton  out once a week  like out of a closet  Norton comes over  like the gimp  yeah  and everybody gets  it's all in the dark  you shut all the lights out  and the girls have to  find their way  and know Norton  has night vision glasses on  like Silence of the Lambs  we have the night vision on 
[01:28:30]  and we just touch them  we grope them  everyone's calling you out  to like just do it  don't do this  maybe in the spring crap  you know you can get  this done sooner  what are you a network  yeah  no no I know  this can be done  all you have to do  is call your tech guys  webcams and open  invitation to home invasion  how is that  that's what he wants  have you ever seen  a home invasion  on a webcam show  but that's what you want  that'd be fantastic  imagine that  you'd be psyched  to hear that window  click open  fire fight people  would see on  the web  yeah  Jesus Christ 
[01:29:00]  and it's well protected  in many ways  this is amazing  all I'm seeing  is muzzle flashes  and blood on the walls  all the girls  that have their own guns  oh god  chicks naked shooting  how hot  like a Quentin Tarantino movie  let's go to Dan  Dan what's up  hey fellas  hey man  I just wanted to say  that I think  the reason that  Anthony's going to wait  till spring for this  to actually happen  is because it's going  to take that long  for these girls  to convince their parents  to fill out the consent form  very nice  listen we got to  head toward a break 
[01:29:30]  so we get  Jeffrey Ross in here  we have a weatherman  that is so fired  really  we were way too busy  to play this yesterday  so check this out  the Vikings are expected  to introduce Alan  later today  because I know  you were all excited  about him this morning  about the prospects  what he could do  for the team  oh I am just so pumped  up putting him next  to what they call  the Williams wall  which is fantastic  already in our defense  Angela how about this  for a tie in  what number  does Jared Allen  wear on his jersey  69  oh ok  what's the current 
[01:30:00]  temperature outside  69  69  it's an omen  a sign  gonna get 69 sacks  I don't know about that  that's a little aggressive  but yeah it is very  warm outside  in fact this is reminiscent  of a couple of days ago  goodbye  so long  take it easy  pack your stuff  here's your name plate  for the top of your box  exactly that wasn't  the temperature  I love how he had  like 69 sacks  yeah we know  we know  but can I just say 
[01:30:30]  something in his defense  anytime somebody says 69  I always in my head  you're always like  ah I get it  you're always like  ah  it doesn't matter  wherever you are  that's gonna be 69  sacks or  I get it  ah you  and you  alright  break time  break time  he's getting angry  over there  I know  stunt brain  stunt brain yes  what happens  webcams coming to  Anthony's house soon  yeah  I don't think he's playing 
[01:31:00]  I think this is gonna happen  yeah I mean why not  let's just go  why not  why not indeed  that's what I say  alright  give us an update  oh absolutely  call your tech guys today  today  I think you should start slow  I think you should start slow  don't you do  you start slow  you give them a little taste  like the crack man  really  give them a little taste  a little free  like a free weekend  a little taste  as you're developing  this whole thing  and then you announce  look the whole production  is gonna be in effect  by November 1st  you're getting a taste  right now 
[01:31:30]  yeah  get them hooked  and then you take it away  and take it away  and then they have to  it's gonna have to be  subscriber based  because you know  because you're running  out of money  we all know that  no I'm not running  out of money  that pool is so expensive  oh my god  I wouldn't know  is it nice  it's ridiculous  I'll invite you over  I will  as long as you perform  for the cameras  what sexually  like a big dumb seal  let me just  do my sink  want to make a lasagna  I'll just cook  in the background  with my tit tank

[01:33:30]  that's it  oh really  that's the ultimate  oh okay  half a million dollars  I think he has a  Rolls Royce too  it has two  first class  airplane seats  in the back  I rode in one of those  are you kidding  I swear to god  each seat has a computer  and it has its own  tray table  and the roof  changes color  to your mood  it is like you're in  first class  in a car  yeah but  you need a driver  for this car  but he actually  drives himself  that's silly  because all the  comfort is in the back  if you spent 
[01:34:00]  half a million  spend the other  thirty thousand  on some schmuck  so much leg room  the seat goes back  the windows are huge  it's amazing  when were you in one  I stole one  for a guy  up  no  car club  oh car club  has one of those  yeah the  Hatton car club  there it is  look at that  those are the back  seats  that's amazing  put that picture  up online  that's comfy  that's a way  to drive around town  yeah  yeah we got  Jeffrey Ross  entering the studio  glad to see you 
[01:34:30]  getting in shape  for dancing  with the stars  sit down  this is the editor  my partner  I know  how about we do it  on the couch there  Jeffrey  wow wee  on the couch there  oh my god  what did she do wrong  that she's paired up  with you Jeffrey  wow  she has to get off  the show early  this season  hi  she has other  commitments  she's going to be  on eating with  the comedians  now Jeffrey  when we found out  that you were  dancing with the  stars 
[01:35:00]  our first thought  was Jeffrey  broke his hip  you told the whole  story on our show  you broke your hip  ice skating  did you tell your  partner that  I told her  but not on the  first day of  training  I let that  I let her  it's been a  problem too  has it  I can't dip her  to the left  I can't do  anything on that  leg really  so my routine  is like  who are you up  against though  the competition  is easy  so I do have  a chance  because you know  what you got to  do just cut  the hamstring  back there  he'll go off  to the left 
[01:35:30]  every time  I am going to  Rocco Despierto  apparently is the  guy that I have  to take  oh really  the cook  the chef  and Lance Bass  I know how to  take him down  he's done some  boy band dancing  so you might be  in trouble there  is he dancing with  a woman or another  man  I think it's an  in-betweener  tranny  nice  what's your name  I'm sorry  editor  you're like a real  dancer  you're like a really 
[01:36:00]  good dancer  I know  she's a comic  editor  a lot of them  are just  not real dancers  she's like a  legitimate dancer  tell by her  legs  editor is a  world class  ballroom  competitive dancer  I trained you well  who's been on this  show for every season  she came in second  last season  her partner was  Jason Taylor  from the Redskins  so were you bummed  when you found out  you were being teamed up  with Jeffrey Ross  I told you I have  other commitments  she wants to be 
[01:36:30]  off early  she got the short  string  is Jeffrey a good  dancer  no  oh nice  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  no you're really  not  no seriously  we have what  two and a half  more weeks  we have two and a  half more weeks  of training  yeah we are done  with our first dance  and we are  starting our second  and he's doing  really well  how hard is that  how hard is that  Jeffrey to like  just like memorizing  the steps  oh I thought you  said how hard is it  to look at her  without losing your  mind  the hard part is  for me is standing 
[01:37:00]  there in two inch  cha-cha heels  for four or five  hours  cha-cha heels  my legs hurt  so I  yeah  it's like everything  changes  I'm like in dance  puberty  my back  my legs  I'll get voted off  in the first  commercial break  it'll be no problem  I'll be back here  in three weeks  going that was cool  made a couple bucks  and what did they  get you in like  a tux or something  I'm actually wearing  they're recreating  my tux that I wore  at my bar mitzvah  it's blue  our first song  is a 70s song  that I won 
[01:37:30]  that I won a dance  contest to  at summer camp  when I was like 10  oh nice  I'm personalizing  all the performances  hey he's the best  out there father  yeah  it's gonna be more  like the godfather  2 dance  never dance  with a Jew  we're doing the  horror for the  first dance  what's the song  we're doing cha-cha  I don't know  can I say the song  no you can't  I can't say the song  oh well  no it's a big secret  I can give some hints  maybe as we go along  but it's a 70s flavor 
[01:38:00]  so it's like a tribute  to my past  what's a cha-cha  Jeff  it's actually called  a cha-cha-cha  editor taught me  editor can probably  explain what cha-cha  means more than I could  no I can't  it's a Latin dance  where men wear heels  and you take small steps  I can give you guys  a demonstration  that'd be great  I would like that  a lot actually  yeah can we see  a little something  can my headphones reach  you can take your  headphones off  while he's doing that  can I just ask you  a question  would you be available  for a webcam house 
[01:38:30]  I've been mulling  things over in my head  I'll get back to you  I told you  I have other comments  damn it  it works for everything  though  alright what are we  doing Jeff  you're standing up  just the lock steps  oh you need music  yeah  no  I don't know how  we're gonna do  the music thing  without a boombox  or something  I can do the music  if you want  perfect  that's a perfect  Cuban cha-cha  Jeff you can hear  a little bit of music  a little bit  we have long  headphones for the guy  so he can like  move around a bit  some short steps  here we go  Jeff you want me  to come for you 
[01:39:00]  wow  cha-cha one  two three  cha-cha one  two three  cha-cha that's it 
[01:39:30]  cha-cha one  Jeff  Jeff can you do it  with her  I mean you guys  are dance partners  it's kind of weird  yeah  she's got  I mean you know  you guys know me  a long time  this is like  every comedian's dream  to be a leading man  for a couple of weeks  and go around  a beautiful  hundred pound  professional  oh my god  look at that ass  I mean  he means Jeff  that's right  look at 
[01:40:00]  legs for days  holy ass  ready  yeah  oh yeah  we're ready  alright  alright  wait a minute  I gotta  Jeff  do you spank him  when he messes up  he doesn't let me eat  we went to the  Carnegie Deli  last night  it looks like 
[01:40:30]  you lost some weight  there Jeff  really  yeah  I mean  is the workouts  you know  killing you  it's like four hours  a day  you know  sweating  it's a real  you know  one of the reasons  I did it  was like  from my hip  and from my  blood pressure  it was like  a wake up call  I would have  I'll probably have a stroke  she doesn't help  with the blood pressure  that's the reason  you did this  not the fact  that it's the hottest  show in America  not the fact  that my DVD  comes out  no it's only a small  but the real reason  is I want to 
[01:41:00]  learn how to cha-cha  in case I'm ever in  where do they do  the cha-cha  I have no idea  Newark  let's say hi to Rob  in New York  Rob  yeah this chick  editor  if you don't watch  this show  she has the hottest  body in everywhere  you look  on tops  you'll never forget  her once you're  on that show  she's fantastic  on the show  how about in person  yeah in person  she's uh  well you didn't  say nothing today  she's amazing  yeah we were  trying to be like  you know 
[01:41:30]  nice  what do you like  about her  you're really nice  yeah  she's a lovely girl  she's tan  she's hot  she's dynamite  yeah  good dancer  she's sitting right here  anything else  you want to describe  to us  yeah we could see her  yeah we're looking  right at her  see our picture  look at that  oh wow  thank you Rob  it's on my  MySpace page  if people want to see it  what is it  the publicity shot  I would put that  on my MySpace page  that is  a hell of a  a leg you got there  well thank you 
[01:42:00]  one of Jeff's friends  in a comedy club  he comes to me  and he goes  is that really you  that always makes me  feel better  no it's just you know  me with a fake boobs  makeup and hair  where are you  where are you from  where are you from  where's the  the sexy accent from  I'm from Poland  oh nice  is Jeff  how many  how many  dance partners  have you had  on this show  I've been there  from the beginning  so Jeff is my  seventh  oh seventh  okay  now if you had 
[01:42:30]  to rate them  in order of  dance ability  and skill  where does Jeff  rank compared  to the other  partners as far  as ability  to dance  he's the best  wow  now come on  is he  is he the  toughest one  to teach  you know what  no he's not  he's  we really have  a good time  but I can't  you know  he's the only  one now  she had  she had  she had  Vincent Pastore  oh wow  who dropped out  after a few  rehearsals  yeah  she had  John Ratzenberger  the guy from  Cheers 
[01:43:00]  yeah  so you just  might be  the best  I might just  be the best  but Jason Taylor  I mean you know  she came in second  last season  she obviously  deserves to win  so when you see  her dance  like full out  you go  well she should  win  so I figure  it's like  it's like  it's like  adding Sarah Palin  to my ticket  people are going  to get excited  about her  who did you  who was  your partner  that you lost  with the guy  from the Redskins  yes  Jason Taylor  he's from what  sorry  who beat you guys  oh  Christy Yamaguchi  she's an ice skater 
[01:43:30]  we knew from the beginning  she stinks  it was fixed  it was  she already knows  how to dance  yeah she spins  on skates  can't do that  she was really good  she was very good  how old are you  do I really have to say  that was him  by the way  that was  that was Bob  that was Bobby  I'm old  oh really  I like that  Bobby come on  you don't ask a lady  you don't ask a lady  how old  you know that  you should hint around  saying like  what was your first election 
[01:44:00]  you remember  when you do the math  what video games  did you play  when you were a kid  she escaped the program  four years ago  yes  exactly  she was on  dancing with the Cossacks  no recollection  of any Iron Curtain  or anything right  no  no  it really isn't  no  it's a big show  you know what I like about  it's formal  it's traditional  it's like very serious  ballroom dancing  so the idea of bringing 
[01:44:30]  comedy to it  is like you know  there's six seasons in  you can bring a little  humor to  something new  who's going to do that  my dancing  I don't even have  to make jokes  Anthony  it's just my dancing  it's like you know  funny as it is  I gotta ask this  stupid question  but you guys are  in close quarters  together  you're dancing  of course  and she's beautiful  and you know  Jeff's  women like Jeff  because Jeff's  you know  there's something  very cute about him  it bugs me  but they do like him  because he's  extremely funny  is there any kind  of like you know  you know  like  any shot 
[01:45:00]  I'm married  I get crap  for asking her age  you're asking  if she's having sex  no no  any shot  why can't people  become connected  to each other  I'm not saying  we are very connected  well not as connected  as Jeffrey wants  who knows  I'm convinced  Jeffrey's already  falling in love  with her  he's silent  he's falling in love  with her  I'll answer the question  I'm not even sure  Edita really knows this  I thought about it  the other day  because somebody  my family was asking  me about Edita  and how it goes down  and what  some of these 
[01:45:30]  similar questions  I feel like  on some level  I love Edita  she is teaching me  essentially how to walk  she's teaching me  how to do this  I made a conscious  decision  I was thrilled  when I saw  that she was married  because it's like  not that I would  ever have a chance  but it's like  it takes it  well you don't have  to think of it  I look at her  like I look at  a 400 pound  high school football  coach  I look at her  like I look at  my high school  football coach  coach Sinise  and I go  that's just  the person  that's going to 
[01:46:00]  tell me what to do  where to stand  so you wanted  to have sex  with your high school  coach  you were in love  with your high school  coach  now everybody knows  you had fantasies  of eating jello  off your high school  coach's chest  I don't like  the serious  Jeffrey Ross  serious  this is like  I'm not dancing  with the stars  I'm a hoofer  now  we don't like  this version  I'm a hoofer  now  leave the studio  and come back  as the real  Jeffrey Ross  you know what else  you know  I know these guys  will appreciate that  it's like  back in the day 
[01:46:30]  you know  I love the Friars Club  and the old  traditions of comedy  comedians knew  how to sing and dance  they were entertainers  I don't know  how to do anything  but smoke pot  and eat Chinese food  so the idea  that I can like  learn how to  some new skill  and put it out there  and be more well rounded  it's like a tribute  to my heroes  yeah but you don't think  this is just gonna  as soon as you're done  with the show  you're not gonna  keep taking dance lessons  no I'll know how to dance  you're gonna come out  on the next roast  tap dancing  with a cane  and a top hat  yeah  like  tossing off to the side 
[01:47:00]  I'm gonna be back  to dick jokes  what are you doing  Jeffrey  every time you see a puddle  are you gonna spin  an umbrella  we're certainly happy  for our friend  but come on  hey it's a huge thing  man  the show is  very popular  it's a number one show  cool thing to be on man  are you married  to a dancer  is he a dancer as well  he's a dancer  he's gonna be on the show  he's dancing with  Tony Bux  oh really  keeping an eye on you  he's right there  you should see your husband  he looks like 
[01:47:30]  Aladdin  or Hercules  from the Disney movies  he knew she wasn't married  to like  some guy who was like  you know  a carpenter somewhere  him  he looks like  he's like the best looking  Jewish guy I've ever seen  really  he's a Russian Jew  how tall is he  he looks like he'd be  on top of a wedding cake  one of those guys  how tall is he  he's pretty tall  he's  no he's your height  actually  really  he's  he's  5'11  how tall are you  5'11  yeah  how long you been 
[01:48:00]  married  just a year  oh wow  newlyweds then  but we know each other  for a long time  just a year  really  they danced in world  competitions together  wow  oh really  rather than kill each other  they got married  and now they do this  does that bother you  like  as a comic  like you know  you're with the beautiful woman  and her husband  is just like  like he knows  that she's not gonna cheat  with you  so he probably like  walks out of the garden  have fun  it's not like  you kind of want to be seen  as like a threat  like hey  I can take your girl  and he's like  have fun  go ahead 
[01:48:30]  just like submissive dogs  like I'm a submissive dog  to him  he just like  kicks me out of the way  he's like  go learn your dance steps  kid  honey before you leave  take that bra off  sends her out  doesn't matter  it is kind of rough  how long have you known  your husband then  since  what  I've known him  for eight years  eight years  we danced together  for eight years  wow  we literally  almost killed each other  he was absolutely right 
[01:49:00]  so you met  let's see  how old were you  I'm really trying to figure out  how old were you  oh the answer is 27  I mean  we all know that  why would you  why would you want  to kill each other  I'm sorry  why would you want  to kill each other  it's pretty  I mean  imagine having your wife  in a  in a studio  every day  working with her  and then going home  and seeing her  that sounds fun  really  yeah  same person  all the time  Jeffrey what are you doing  it's very tough  there's pictures of us  rehearsing on  edit his my space page 
[01:49:30]  oh  some funny pictures  of me trying to do my moves  Jeffrey's gonna make us  watch this  Dancing with the Stars  this season  isn't that awesome  that sucks  for a week  for a week  Bobby said for a week  you know what  the sad thing is Bobby  it's not even one day  I could get voted off  on the first night  wow  the premiere is  three nights long  and I dance twice  so I have to learn  two routines right now  and then on the first night  I might not even get  to dance the second routine  wait who are the other  guys again  or the other  the beginners 
[01:50:00]  take it from the  Warren Sapp  football player  yeah they can't move  too well  he's a Super Bowl champ  bad knees  so you got a shot there  you got a Super Bowl champ  you got two gold medalists  from this year's  Misty May trainer  and the volleyball champ  she ain't losing  volleyball  she's not a guy  she's a guy-ish  no we're talking about  we're talking about  the beginners  just to see where  Jeffrey would  yeah  so then there's  Maurice Green  the world's fastest man  Olympic gold medalist  wait did Jamaican dude  quick 
[01:50:30]  I think so yeah  no that's  no that's American  that's both  oh yeah  well whatever  two gold medalists  who cares  okay  Lance Bass  from NSYNC  obviously  delicious  delicious  and uh  Cloris  Cloris Leachman  82 year old  Oscar winning actress  they won't vote her  unless she does  something really bad  cause you know  she's charming  and everybody loves her  that's a stroke  she's great  she doesn't look  a day over dead  they're gonna take away 
[01:51:00]  two Emmys  just by appearing  in the show  she might be begging  to get voted off  after a couple of weeks  they're not gonna vote her  she did hit on me  at the cast party  yeah  she laid down on my lap  put my hand on her breast  her son was sitting  like where Jimbo is  from right now  she squeezed my hand  and said  I love you Jeff  do you love me  and I was like  did she really do that  your son's right there  you know  it's just so awkward  did her life alert go off  when you hit it accidentally  as he was squeezing  did her chicken cutlet  fall out of her shirt 
[01:51:30]  oh damn  wow  ugh  yeah so uh  Cloris Leachman  Susan Lucci  she's got you know  from the  you know  the soap opera  woman that never wins  and then she won  she's Fredo  but we saw her yesterday  we met her  we like  crossed paths  at the dance studio  she's like hot  she's really  she's 62  smoking hot  isn't she really small  she's tiny  yeah 
[01:52:00]  she's like editor size  and she's 62  and she looks really pretty  so maybe she'll be good  she'll probably be popular  I mean that's  you know  do you have a shot though  Lance Bass though  is probably gonna do  because he danced  Tony Braxton  obviously  she's gonna be good too  she dances  all those music people  dance and do choreographs  why do you call them  music people  music people  they do music  and they're people  the Vegas Odds came out  I came out last  at 50 to 1  ooh  I'm gonna bet on you  I know  it's pretty sad 
[01:52:30]  Stephen Hawking  has a better chance  of winning  slowly rolling  back and forth  his partner  is just in a gown  angrily wheeling him  back and forth  you got your work  cut out for you  Jimbo  if I do well  I'll break open doors  maybe you'll be on  next season  I have a bad ankle  I have a bad hip  yeah he's got a real bad hip  that's the whole point  is I'm doing it  for regular guys  guys who never thought  they could learn  something like this  it's very romantic 
[01:53:00]  you know  you ask a girl  out on a date  you can dance  daddy you dance  very good daddy  oh my god daddy  all those body contact  things  because you are  in close proximity  I just kind of feel  very kind of sexual  in a way  even though it's dancing  it's still  there's something  intimate about it  it's very intimate  I would compare it to  and I don't have a lot  of experience with this  either  but it'd be like  a romantic scene  you know  you're playing a character  essentially  you're doing  the pasadoble  or whatever  you take on a persona  are there any moments  where she'll do something 
[01:53:30]  during the dance  but you might go  wow  it's kind of  maybe something  she's doing  just for me  but you're like  and then she's like  no it's just part  of the dance  stupid  it's always part  of the dance  right  it's always part  of the dance  last night we made out  and it was part  of the dance  you do that whole thing  where sometimes  you gotta just  make that look  give her the look  right in the eyes  that's another thing  there's a lot of  like locking eyes  right right  it's hard not to think  that it's like  we don't really get  to that part yet  the locking  oh no  no it's more Jeff  just creepily staring  just trying to eat lunch 
[01:54:00]  and he's just locking eyes  not even at the studio  she's home  he's outside the window  locking eyes  and the husband's  not even threatened by him  he's like looking  through the blinds  I think your dance  part is outside  hey Jeffrey  your odds  your odds are up  to 25 to 1  what  and Warren Sapp  is 20 to 1  so  wow  and then you got  Rocco's up to 20 to 1  that's awesome  they're moving up  a little bit  based on what I wonder 
[01:54:30]  you're still the long shot  I think this show  Leachman is up  to 18 to 1  of course Leachman's up  to 18 to 1  odds are going up  a little bit  I think people have been  seeing some  you know  rehearsal footage  and stuff  and who knows  Warren Sapp's an athlete  so they're probably  giving him the benefit  of the doubt  more than they should  they're not thinking  bad knees  like Ope said  they're thinking  ah he's a Super Bowl champ  he's very limber  even big dumb athletes  are limber  because they're athletes  football players  have won this thing  in past seasons  right  they've done really well  each one of them  didn't Rice do pretty well  when he was on  he was second  and Emmitt Smith won 
[01:55:00]  Emmitt Smith won  yeah but they're all  thin football players  Warren Sapp is a big  monster  those guys are  running backs  and wide receivers  and stuff  I mean those guys  are thin  and Jason Taylor  is like handsome  and you know  he looks like that guy  that you'd expect  Heather to dance with  well he's really tall  I was terrified  when I started to dance  with him  just as much  I was terrified  when I started to dance  with you  different reasons though  with him you're like  oh my god  there's this big alpha male  he's too tall for me  with Jeff  it's like  ugh  I don't have enough time 
[01:55:30]  do you just go  into a room somewhere  and pick everyone's name  out of a hat  and then you just went like  oh  how did you get me  how did you get me  how did you get me  yeah how did  how does the decision  making go  as to who you get  I wish you know  someone told me  how it happens  I don't know  it's a producer's  decision really  yeah  I have no input  in it  and  they were mad  at you  I guess  they threatened her  with Jeff  she was like  looking for a bigger  contract  and like look  if you keep arguing  that's who we stick to it 
[01:56:00]  every season  you get a Jeff Ross  did you walk by  Jeff the studio  at one point  like the producer's  office  and you hear her  screaming  why  why  she's not talking  about me  hey let me go  to the phone  for a second  TJ the trucker  we missed something  when Jimmy said  he can't do the show  because he has a bad ankle  go ahead TJ  yeah Jimmy says  he can't do the show  because of his bad ankle  Heather Mills  had one leg  that's right  alright  Marlee Madeline  was deaf 
[01:56:30]  and she still  danced to the  vibrations  yeah good for her  did she really  yeah  good for her  did she get voted  off first week  no she went  really really far  she didn't know  she kept coming back  sorry  she kept dancing  to the commercial break  she did not  so you guys  rehearse every day  every day  do you ever look down  and see like mustard  from Jeff's sandwich  on your shirt  that for sure  and you're gonna have to  you know  take criticism I guess  huh 
[01:57:00]  that's some part  of this whole thing  that's the other part  about Edita  it's either like  either I'm progressing  very well  or she should get an Oscar  because she has me  convinced that I'm  good  competent  wow  or at least improving  to get an Oscar  alright listen  we do have to take a break  we're real late here  at least that's for dancing  and not for you know  I hate that  you're improving  yeah  you're doing much better  now  yeah your breath  doesn't blow me over  in the morning  I hope everybody  votes for us  if not for me  for Edita  she came in second 
[01:57:30]  last season  yeah  you're gonna do alright  you'll hang in there  for a couple weeks  with your help I will  yeah I think  oh we'll put out the word  yeah we'll put out the word  yeah plus you're funny dude  you'll say some funny stuff  that someone wrote for you  and then you'll stay on  for a couple more days  I'm not gonna want to see you  booted off  no I'm not gonna want to see you  booted off  because you got too much  personality man  you'll make me feel very funny  and she's hot  yeah and she's fantastic  people just want to look at her  and seeing you guys together  is actually people like that  people like when they see  the guy like you  with a girl like her 
[01:58:00]  they want to see you  stick around  I know it's like  gives everyone hope  or something  how did that happen factor  it's like when Lyle Lovett  married Julia Roberts  right  like every guy quit the gym  they were like  what's the point  we're gonna wrap up next  Opie and Anthony  what are you guys doing over there  it's the Opie and Anthony show  very busy show  everybody's just  peering over  at the Paltalk cameras  at the various  Paltalk windows  that are up  a lot of action  on the Paltalk cameras  today huh 
[01:58:30]  flight girl with benefits  God bless her  flight benefits  of course is showering  showering and topless  gonna see that  this is a look into  what we could be  seeing at Anthony's house  right  well yeah of course  Jeffrey you missed it  what happened  we entered stage 3  of Anthony's  psychosis today  I heard what happened  man I'm sorry  my insanity  oh no no  he doesn't give a crap  about that  oh something else  he's slowly but surely  losing his mind  and to our benefit  by the way  he now wants to  set up webcams 
[01:59:00]  all over his house  and fill his house  with beautiful young women  I figure 6 to 8 girls  and um  he's not joking  webcams  in the house  and then just  whatever happens  you gotta give him roles  like somebody takes care  of this  somebody takes care  see I don't want  this to be like  a reality thing  where anybody  is influenced  in any way  I want drunk  girls  over the house  just  being drunk  girls  everyone wants  to peer in on 
[01:59:30]  a bunch of  partying girls  basically Anthony  wants to be Caesar  yes  that's great  you'll be like  the Hugh  rent Caligula  you'll be the  Hugh Hefner of herpes  I just  I want  I figure  it'd be nice  I'll set up  some bunk beds  in some of the rooms  so they could  bunk together  yes  the age of the girls  he sleeps with  that's perfect  I think you're thinking  of spunk beds  that's awesome Anthony  you know what  I'm always about  you know  opening up your life 
[02:00:00]  a little bit  the next  the next thing  the next big move  I'm always about  you know  if you feel that  passion  that urge  you should go for it  why not  right  your dance partner  is a little  disturbed by the whole thing  she's very traditional  she's been married  a long  you know  been with the same guy  a long time  why doesn't she ask  Anthony a question  about this  what  about your  great idea  yeah the webcams  in his house  what do you think  what do you think  what is going to be  your role  my role 
[02:00:30]  is kind of like  the ringleader  kind of a thing  and  because  they'll be  screwing stuff up  so much  that I'll be  going crazy  alright  you need the  organized one  oh and just  ridiculous amounts  of sex  yeah  but  no I'm teasing  of course  he's the bankroll  and the shishkebobber  that's what he's doing  provides the money  and the male genitals  Jasmine I told you  to shovel the walk  that would be funny 
[02:01:00]  if these girls  thought they were  getting into a cool  situation  it turns out  it's nothing but  chores all the same  slave mansion  I love it  don't let them leave  yeah just lock  it actually turns  into the end  is me being arrested  on legitimate  kidnapping charges  because you have  like six girls  buried to their neck  in your basement  in cement  with heat lamps  on their face  cement  you're like motel hell  yeah  no preservatives  hotel Rwanda  yeah  should we just  come in  should we get  sanctuary 
[02:01:30]  should we set  up an application  page on  onaradio.com  yeah we definitely  should do that  I think an  application page  a picture  a short bio  and that should  be enough right  now for the  screening process  I think the picture  would be sufficient  and what you're  hoping to get  oh what's that  a what  I'm saying a picture  would be sufficient  a picture is all  I don't need to  know anything  else  picture proof  of age  willingness  yes yes  18 welcome  I don't think  and you with a  scale 
[02:02:00]  girls with throat  cancer welcome  that's the doormat  it's a scale  and if this says  welcome  or you're escorted  out in cuffs  the floor just  opens up  there's a trick  door  yeah  I don't think  you told your  partner about  our show  jeffrey  no she knows  she knows  yeah I'm sure  jeffrey  editor happens  to have a very  good sense of  humor and I  think the one  thing it was  interesting they  asked me when I  met with the  producers I  said what  partner do you 
[02:02:30]  want and I  said honestly I  don't care as  long as she has  a good sense of  humor and they  scored  she rolls with it  have you brought  her flowers or  anything  he did  oh my goodness  I know  see we know  this jeffrey  ross a little  bit  you're a  hopeless romantic  without that  romantic part  bob hopeless  romantic  oh that's  sweet  when did he  bring you the  flowers  yeah when  he brought  the flower  first meeting  he's my first 
[02:03:00]  partner that  did that  wow  he brought  him to you  obviously he  brought him  before she  told him that  she's married  I didn't care  well yeah I  mean that was a  little bit rough  he saw the ring  and they just  wilted in his  hand  or the husband  walked in and  said oh those  are nice and  she went there  from jeffrey  and he goes  yeah  yeah you know  it's interesting  like you know  you know  opie said I  lost weight  like last night  we went to the  carnegie deli 
[02:03:30]  after rehearsal  and then the  night before that  we ate borscht  at the comedy  cellar and  she'll be the  first dancer to  gain weight on  the show  well I  like I'm a bad  influence on her  and from that  I'm eating every  waffle like it's  my last meal  ever thinking  I'm gonna be  burning it off  and I never  do  you know I  lost hope  about you  losing weight  so I decided  to gain 15  pounds  so we can  make it look  a little better  you brought  you to the  fryer's club  I was thinking  of going to the  fryer's club  for lunch today  because I thought  editor would get  a kick out of that  what are we  eating  steak and potatoes  and cheesecake 
[02:04:00]  I've just seen  her devour this  chocolate cheesecake  glass  what else do we  have french fries  she can eat  you know one of  the one of the  one of the  one of the  olympians I said  if you know if  the furnace is  burning hot enough  you can throw  anything in there  you know what  the truth of the  matter is I've  spoken with a lot  of girls about  eating and keeping  thin and this is  like the truth  it's it's they  all say no I  just get rid of  it they talk  about how often  the food the  food yeah the 
[02:04:30]  food okay the  food that not the  way not puking  like through the  natural course of  digestion we'll  make sure we're  talking about  food yeah well  Jesus of course  talk about you  know I don't  understand twice a  day they're on  the bowl but  that doesn't make  you lose weight  does it apparently  it does on some  people really yeah  it's not in you  anymore your body's  processing it but  doesn't it take  the fat out and  first doesn't have  time to become  fat I actually  never thought of  that yeah you  have to you're  eating it just 
[02:05:00]  because you go  faster Jimmy is  oh fat if it's  sitting in there  it turns to sugar  and that turns to  fat if you just  get it in and get  it out nothing  happens you just  take a pill and  then sit on the  toilet and put your  knees up to your  chest I think  you're turning me  on she's listening  you could come back  he's not here every  day oh really  yeah he's not  really no no  don't blow up  her spot we got  a hot girl in the  studio for once we  want to be friends  with her as well 
[02:05:30]  as well don't throw  me under the bus  you jackass  you're talking  about liquid you  know what and we  got a hot girl in  studio that's not  what I was talking  about thanks thanks  for defending she  is the star of the  show I mean if  people are I mean  she's been on every  season she came in  second last year  she'll be around  it's like it's like a  sitcom like people  break out this is her  year to break out  are you uh threatened  does it bother you  that your husband's  dancing with Tony  Braxton um no not  really I mean why  would it bother me  I don't know just  because you know she's 
[02:06:00]  a big you know she's  actually very small  no I mean she's uh  is that what is that  Terrence Howard singing  yeah I hate his hat  god almighty all right  well some of the stars  some of the dancers  actually hook up with  the stars like what's  his name from save  from saved by the  bell hooked up with  a dancer they  happened a lot I  think really the guy  the kid from saved  by the bell  gorgeous body  Dustin diamond  no the other guy 
[02:06:30]  mario  mario lopez  yeah but he's a  good he would hook  up without even  being so what do  you like about  mario lopez  the body  it's the way the  jawline like you  think like wow the  beauty stops there  with the full lips  but all the way down  the chest  his hamstrings are  nice and the  interesting thing is  he's a better dancer  than emmett smith but  emmett smith still won  so i do have some  kind of chance  who's the partner  though whose  partner is better  i mean  um 
[02:07:00]  no they're both  great  they're so you  know not only it's  the interesting thing  is not only do we  dance together but  she has to teach me to  dance and choreograph  our routine so it's  more of a competition  for the professional  dancers almost  you mean you don't  have a choreographer  that comes in and  does it you're the  one that's figuring  this out for him  that's pretty much  yeah pretty much we  take control over  every single  pretty much how  how often do you  have to practice  how much six days a  week six days a  week and how long  each day at least  four or five hours 
[02:07:30]  four or five hours a  day oh my god for  six day wow yeah  man it's that is  work you know we  sit around for three  hours 45 minutes  dance for 15  oh okay no i'm  kidding it's like a  union job and we  have lunch out on  the pavement yeah  whistle it girls it  is a competitive thing  for the dancer that's  exactly why it makes  sense yeah let's see  what you can do with  this she's so good  they're like all right  well let's just see if  you've got no  disrespect to jeff but

[02:18:30]  was the one  that spewed  his uh  his nonsense  that got us  suspended from  satellite radio  oh yeah yeah  because the old ceo  really didn't get  our radio show  yeah  should be said  and it was funny  stuff that charlie  said it made me laugh  and i'll never apologize  for what i've laughed  at ever  well i have to explain  why i laughed at a joke  to some cunty blogger  it was so obvious  that the guy was  out of his mind  and he was funny  he's a funny guy  with a brutal sense  of humor  and he's living  in shit conditions  he's a homeless guy  and he had the nerve 
[02:19:00]  to do really  but it wasn't even  about that  xm's response  and look  i love elo  and the response  should have been  he's a homeless guy  he made some jokes  drop dead  satellite radio  there's given a certain  freedom here  where a homeless guy  should be able to come up  and say whatever he wants  no matter how offensive  or stupid it is  because he's  99% of the homeless people  are a little crazy  yeah  i mean please  i gotta say  in elo's defense  he went out there for us  oh he completely did  he saved us  i learned after the fact  that somebody really 
[02:19:30]  really wanted us fired  of course  really wanted us fired  of course  he was no longer  with the company  he wanted us thrown out  faster than his toothpaste  and mouthwash  whoa  i love how he delivered  that line  and went right back  to reading  well  hey look  how are you guys  enjoying your time  at satellite radio  i don't know  but that asshole  with teeth  you're putting in my face  really has  an offensive odor  wafting out of it  you wouldn't get  that many words in 
[02:20:00]  before he would just  step on you  and start talking  over you anyway  because it was never  about anything  anyone else had to say  that's right  what can we get  for you spittle lips  yeah  thank you  dumpster gums  i was always nice  seeing strings  of fucking  whatever the hell  that white shit  was going between  his lips  ugh  there's the petting  of the head  oh the petting  of the head  you just missed it  oh fuck  no i saw a little  petting of the head  that was kind of cute  he was licking her hand  and then swiping it  over the little baby's head  look at this fucking  hockey player  he just knocked  this chick up  and now he's standing  with fucking 
[02:20:30]  is that fucked up  yeah but he's bumming dude  you know  of course he is  you know guys in suits  came up to him  you're marrying her  he said the same thing  Bob  oh yeah  that's exactly  what the fuck happened  we're convinced that  his life isn't his anymore  oh he's still a douche too  he's up there at the end  chewing gum  was he  look look look  look at  oh my god  what is she doing  he gave a three year old  a baby to hold  exactly  she's using it as a toy  he's probably chewing gum  yeah but Bobby  what kind of damage  could she really do 
[02:21:00]  to the kids  yeah look he is  he's chewing gum  he's probably  one of his breath to stink  he's probably nervous  dry mouth  you're a hockey player  from Alaska  have a fucking mint  no one will ever know you  have a tic tac  he's chomping gum  you don't chomp gum  yeah you do  at the national convention  I respect that  he doesn't know  this poor kid  is fucking  bumming  he banged this chick  he bangs the  sorry go ahead  he banged this chick  he got her knocked up  and he was like  okay  and her mother  is pro-life  so there wasn't even 
[02:21:30]  a chance that he  could go with the old  but there was a chance  especially in Alaska  where you can go  alright well fuck you  I'm out  I'm gonna go fish  I'm gonna go  fucking hunt polo bears  I'm gone  and she'd have to raise it  but now  that they're getting  he has to marry her  oh he has to now  oh McCain probably  showed up himself  that's it  no they probably  they didn't force him  they showed him  here's what your life  would be like  what are you gonna go on  you're gonna get married  in ten years  you're gonna have a baby anyway  so why don't you marry  this girl  and your life  changes for the good  like  set for life 
[02:22:00]  you're set for life  you're a  she's a governor of Alaska  even if she doesn't  you're screaming  she's still the governor of Alaska  I didn't mean to cut you off  I'm sorry  she's still the governor of Alaska  it's a good question though  what if she loses  what if she loses  she goes back to being  the governor of Alaska  that's it  which is shit  it's not the greatest thing  but you're still  you're still on this stage  you're still like  you bang  you're still the father  of the granddaughter  of a presidential  not saying that that's everything  but she's gonna have the kid anyway 
[02:22:30]  let me tell you something  if she doesn't  if they don't win  she goes back to being  a governor of that shithole  and he dumps her  guaranteed  he goes  I'm fucking out  now that your secret service guys  aren't threatening my life  I'm done  go do your thing  I'm young  I'm a hockey player  I live in Alaska  you don't think  you don't think  they're getting married  before the fucking election  no  she's gonna have that baby  like when  when is she having the baby  next week  she's five months in  yeah  four or five months in  I got plenty of time 
[02:23:00]  plenty of time  they weren't dumping that baby  anyway man  well this ain't  this is recent  this just happened  they weren't gonna get rid of that baby  no way  she was having it anyway  on stage  at the convention  he should just  wail a boot  right into her stomach  and just watch the people  horrified  he should just take  the retarded baby  and throw it at her stomach  at the inauguration  it bounces off  and becomes normal  alright listen  what  it's a baby  of course it is 
[02:23:30]  little baby  and they're saying  that this other baby  this might be  her other daughter's baby  that's what the liberal bloggers  were saying  that's why she had to come out  and say it's bullshit  conspiracy theories  although her body  bounced back  pretty quickly  oh it did  you never stand  on photos of her  pregnant a few months ago  there's a video  going on  going around on YouTube  where John McCain  just keeps looking at  Sarah Palin  or Palin's ass  yeah  he cannot stop  looking at her ass  there's a photo  I think there's a link  on instant feedback 
[02:24:00]  there Danny  they did something  they did something together  a couple days ago  and she was in a tight  white button up shirt  walking with McCain  and one nipple  she's got big nipples  one nipple  was hard  I mean just smoking hard  just pointing  ugh  really  just one  the right nipple  was just popping out  of that tight white shirt  interesting  oh it was gorgeous  gorgeous  big fucking nip man  what about Cindy McCain  she's alright  she's fine  she's pretty hot

[02:28:30]  all of a sudden  she wants to  bomb Saudi  what was that  comment  we were talking  about earlier  contrived  they said  it seemed  really contrived  some dumb  thing about  foreign policy  shut up  but I do like  the idea of  bombing something  in Saudi Arabia  whatever it is  I'm for it  I don't care  if it's a US  embassy  that would be  our economy  my friends  oh by the way  since I've never  asked for a pen  to be here  when we come over  could somebody  out there  why would there  be a pen  holy shit  right  every day  not you Danny  somebody out there  who's fucking  you know  just a pen

[02:30:00]  and it's just quick  he wants to apologize  I hope so  because he caused  a lot of grief  for a lot of people  well he certainly did  but it wasn't his fault  that's for sure  I wouldn't blame him  in a second  and here we go  alright so we're  outside with  homeless Charlie  homeless Charlie  what's the haps  what's the haps  I just want to say  first I'm sorry  to open air  I'm in trouble  and shit  but now we got  all this  sentimental bullshit  out the way  fuck it  how the fuck

[02:38:00]  right now  fun guy  Pablo Escobar  if you read  about the  Medellin cartel  when they were  in their heyday  when they were  providing 80%  of the cocaine  into the United  States  and it was him  and it was the  Olsha brothers  OCHA  and it was  Louis Gacha  who was the  enforcer  G-A-C-H-A  he was killed  years ago  I read this  there's a book  called the man  who made it  snow  you see a lot  of movies  based around  this guy's  life  his name 
[02:38:30]  is Max  Mermelstein  and he was  a Jewish  guy  who married  Colombian  but that  name  I know  had him  pegged as  German  what was  his name  again  Max  Mermelstein  Mermelstein  that is  the  Jewishest  name  well he was  the winner  of Jewishest  name  in history  that's  even worse  than  Max  Jew  bag  what's  my name  Max  Jew  bag  I'm  Jewish  holy  Max 
[02:39:00]  Mermelstein  if everyone's  done being  anti-Semitic  smart move  Bob in the  business  I was just  saying it's  a Jewish  name  no he's  he was  married to  a Colombian  girl  and he  helped her  brother cover  up a murder  get rid  of a body  so they  kind of  he became  his  what's the word  it's not a  companion or  something  it's when you  okay for  somebody in  but he begins  with a C  compadre  I think that's  what they call it  and he became 
[02:39:30]  friend in Spanish  but I mean  that's  no no but  that's what  the  well I  wouldn't know  that I'm  not Spanish  by birth  like some  people here  he got into  the Medellin  cartel  he's the  highest American  to ever get  that close  to the  Colombians  and he  helped  orchestrate  how drops  were done  how the  cocaine  was dropped  from planes  into the  US  and they  were  I think  I was  talking about  this before  but they  were brilliant  how they  would set up  the drops  you'd pick  it up  from the  water  and they  would have  it all  in this  specially  built car  and they 
[02:40:00]  would have  the car  drive  with a million  or two  million dollars  of cocaine  in it  and they  would have  a fucking  a tow truck  pull it  and that's  how they  would get  it  because  people  aren't  going to  pull over  a tow truck  and check  the car  in the back  and they  would have  a drunk  driver  a guy  with a  bottle  of whiskey  in case  that car  did get  pulled over  and the  cop was  walking up  they would  have a guy  with a  bottle  of whiskey  in his  hand  plow  into the  cop's car  and take  the  not kill  the cop  but just  drunk  drive  into the  police  car  and while  the cop  was addressing 
[02:40:30]  this  that tow truck  would just  pull out  that's pretty  good  he actually  met pablo  escobar  you know  and then  americans  didn't get  anywhere near  pablo  escobar  i forget  what he  called  but yeah  it was  really  interesting  there's  actually  a good  documentary  on hbo  right now  about i think  it's maybe  showtime  about all  all that  shit  really  oh yeah  it's insane  what's it  called  i forget  the name  of it  actually  it tell  told me  to watch  it  but it's  it's  insane  it's all  about when  they first  started doing 
[02:41:00]  pot  and then  this coke  stuff was  like whatever  and then  this coke  stuff  yeah  they didn't  even know  there's a future  in it  and there's  these two  guys one  was the  boat guy  and one  uh he was  telling a story  that the  actual coast  guard pulled  him over  on his boat  and he  no his name  was macgyver  i think  they pulled  him over  on the boat  and he had  it was packed  with cocaine  and right  at that point  the coast  guard's boat  the engine  just went  pop  and a piston  shot out of  it  and they  they were  like ah 
[02:41:30]  jeez  can you give  us a tow  and he was  like yeah  i guess  and he  towed the  coast guard  with his  boat  packed with  coke  unbelievable  did he confess  about the  coke after  and right  when he pulled  him and he  goes guys  i just want  to let you  know  since we  became  friends  and you  know  they probably  heard that  story years  later  and they're  like uh-huh  you're good  let's go to  striker  striker  striker  striker  and they 
[02:42:00]  are all  um dead  i think  gotcha  was killed  in 89  and i know  i'm saying  his name  wrong  well but  like that  max  that you  were talking  about  and a few  of those  other ones  were still  alive  because this  was just  all done  within i think  the last  18 months  to two years  that this 
[02:42:30]  was all  yeah marmalstein  is in the  witness uh  witness protection  program  marmalstein  i'm in the  witness protection  program  he um  they abandoned  him like  pass the  mullet fish  how do you  lose a  merminstein  he got in  trouble  he got in  trouble  he got arrested  and he felt  that they  kind of abandoned  him  and that's the  only reason  that they  went  everyone's  talking about  uh  this movie  yeah it's a  great movie  it's a great  movie 
[02:43:00]  documentary  it's a  documentary  right  these guys  i love that  shit  the guy showed  up in i think  florida with uh  i don't know  he had like 400  bucks and then  almost and then  he's just a  millionaire  yeah  like in a week  or some shit  he showed up  with nothing  then he started  like in a week  he would drive  he would get  the car  they would drop  the drop the  coke in the  water and they  would specially  wrap it but the  colombians kept  fucking up  right and the  guy was like look  you have to wrap  it this way i'm  dropping it in the  ocean if you 
[02:43:30]  don't it's gonna  and they kept  saying fucking  whatever and they  lost millions just  because they didn't  wrap it right and  it would just go in  the ocean and just  fucking dissolve  a fish doing 90  miles an hour looks  like a speedboat  going through the  fucking water  well max told a  story about that  where they were the  packages were breaking  open and he had to i  think explain himself  to the ocho brothers  you don't want to be  in that position and  they were basically  wanted to know are we  being ripped off or is  this the cost of doing  business and it got  chalked up to the cost of  doing business i think  they believed what he 
[02:44:00]  said i wonder if they  work like people around  here and go no the uh  this guy was supposed to  wrap it let's bring him  in hey you're fat  our staff passes the  buck you don't think  they're passing the buck  for the ocho brothers  want to know what eight  million dollars worth of  coke is fucking fish food  why is a salmon swimming  200 miles an hour now  that was my joke what was  your joke my fish swimming  he just said it mine was  80 miles an hour he added  salmon you just said fish  dude talk about not 
[02:44:30]  listening i was so wrapped up  in my own shit  coin city yourself  i can't wait i love those on  the replay when you hear it  and then bam you hear it  again it's a whole different  show when you listen on the  replay yeah those guys  would have to stop you  like wow he said that  today i had one yesterday  that i heard on the replay  fuck  something funny that you  missed the first time  yeah  i was like what the fuck 
[02:45:00]  all right listen uh we're  gonna move backwards uh we  got the john stewart stuff  i think it's worth playing  backwards so cocaine  cowboys on showtime  cocaine cowboys really good  documentary she's a populist  she's an economic and a  social conservative she's  yeah a little setup here  carl rove talks about uh  palin or palin i i'm still  hearing it both ways so you  gotta pick away and stick with  it though i'm gonna go with  uh i'm going palin  i'll go palin 
[02:45:30]  i'll go palin  i'm go  oh that'll be confusing  my culture is paline  you're gonna go paline  and jimmy go goes with paline  paline  all right  she's a populist  she's an economic and a social  conservative  she's a reformer  she's a former mayor  she's the mayor i think of the  second largest city in alaska  before she ran for governor  carl rove is very impressed  with governor palin's experience  as mayor of a city with  9,000 people in it  i imagine 
[02:46:00]  is that really how many  people are in that  9,000  yeah  wow i heard five  5,000  that's what i heard  7,500  ross is going to gig us  there next week  for the whole  place  i imagine  he was equally impressed  last month  wow  when tim kane  former mayor of richmond  population 200,000  former lieutenant governor  of virginia and now  current virginia governor  was on barack obama's  vice presidential short list  he's been a governor for  three years  he was mayor of the 
[02:46:30]  105th largest city in america  and again with all due  respect to richmond virginia  it's smaller than  chula vista california  aurora colorado  mesa or gilbert arizona  north las vegas or  henderson nevada  it's not a big town  so if he were to pick  governor kane  it would be an intensely  political choice  where he said  you know what  i'm really not  first and foremost  concerned with  is this person capable  of being president  of the united states  fucking stewart  home run  wow  home run for stewart  you know what 
[02:47:00]  no instant replay needed  wow  if you're gonna  fucking talk that  kind of shit  you better not be  inconsistent  that's why this  whole political game  is a crock of shit  they don't think  it's being taped  i think they just  think it goes away  is someone making  a kinescope of this  i hope not  but it works both ways  fucking biden was  saying awful things  about obama  now he's praising obama  so this whole game  is just bullshit  in the end  that's why i really  don't care  i don't care  but they do both  make sense though 
[02:47:30]  i mean you know  look i'm not a smart  i'm not a smart guy  we all know that  don't have to sell  that point  because of jimmy  and you  and you  and everyone's ability  to process  information  yes exactly  you're absolutely  right jimmy  but when you  when you watch  like last night  you watched  the the uh  the uh  convention  thank you  and you're like  oh my god  she makes sense  that makes sense  oh shit  and you're like  what the fuck  it makes sense  then you listen  to the uh  barack  and you're like  wait he makes sense  oh that makes sense  it's like what the fuck 
[02:48:00]  they're both lying  about everything  and it fucks up  the middle class  hump like me  to go i don't know  and then you  then you wind up  just voting  for tits  or fucking  or basketball  bobby  you gotta be  upper middle class  at this point  who are you kidding  what i'm a  you're not middle class  i just can't  i think mentally  i am  you're not  obama is  obama is about  bigger government  and more  uh money  taken from the people  from the rich people 
[02:48:30]  no  no they consider  rich  being rich  is a very uh  it's a lot lower level  than really being rich  two hundred thousand dollars  no hundred thousand dollars  is it a hundred  yeah  i thought it was two hundred  you try living in  new york city  and make a hundred thousand dollars  and see how far it gets you  because that's where you're getting  that kind of money  you know you're not you're not  making that in iowa  but most of the country  doesn't a hundred thousand  dollars is a fucking living  forty thousand dollars  is a living  fifty thousand dollars  and thirty thousand dollars  is a living 
[02:49:00]  jesus how far are you gonna go  i was just gonna keep  going until somebody  one thousand dollars  until somebody agreed with me  ten thousand dollars  hey ten thousand  come on  ten thousand  forty thousand  we got the o'reilly clip  which is even better  from uh the daily show  but first  uh just so everyone can enjoy  we got uh anthony's joke  followed by jimmy's joke  sounding quite similar to each other  oh okay  uh iraq put this uh together  and they lost millions  just because they didn't wrap it right  and it would just go in the ocean 
[02:49:30]  and just fucking dissolve  the fish doing ninety miles an hour  looks like a speed boat  going through the fucking water  our staff passes the buck  you don't think they're passing the buck  for the ochoa brothers  want to know  like eight million dollars worth of coke  is fucking fish food  why is the salmon  swimming 200 miles an hour now  that was my joke  that was my joke  i have  i have  that was my joke  just as a comic  i'd have to say  anthony i love you  but jimmy  he put more detail 
[02:50:00]  his was better  his was better  he ended up with the ochoa brothers  the salmon  the s  the ochoa  the words he used  you're just fast fish  uh i could say that the salmon  would be a uh  freshwater river fish  no it's only a freshwater fish  oh when it swims back  when it swims back  it's it's it's saltwater  to go up to lay the eggs  and the newborns  are freshwater  until they jump back  into the ocean  then there's saltwater  so we should have said  that they're swimming  very fast upstream  yeah  no actually 
[02:50:30]  yes i think jimmy's delivery  was better  and more exaggeration  on the speed  200 miles an hour  is better than 80  it's way better  but basically though  you win  because what i did  was i just  i apparently took a joke  that i heard  and just went  alright i'll keep that  it's like taking a statue  and then just chiseling  a little more detail  into the face  you didn't build the statue  you're just a cunt  who wasn't listening  it's carlos norton  no but you don't understand  they swim really fast  hey man  that's anthony's joke 
[02:51:00]  carlos norton  yeah of course  no i've never heard anthony  who's anthony  huh  what  let's uh  let's play the second clip  from the deli show  where john stewart  well at least everyone  can agree on the  more sensitive issue  of governor palin's  pregnant  teen daughter  millions of american  families are dealing  with teenage pregnancy  and as long as society  doesn't have to support  the mother  father  or baby  it is a personal matter  it is true that some  americans will judge  governor palin  and her family 
[02:51:30]  for the sake of her  and her family  we hope things calm down  yes  papa bear  teen pregnancy  is an issue  for which judgment  is personal  and must be  withheld  oh no  on a pinhead front  16 year old  jamie lynn spears  is pregnant  the sister of britney  says she is shocked  i bet  here the blame  falls primarily  on the parents  of the girl  who obviously  have little control  over her  incredible  family  i fucking 
[02:52:00]  love this stuff  how much do you  love this stuff  what a douche  and he calls his show  the no spin zone  no spin  this motherfucker  spins faster than a top  wow  what an ass  he spins and spins  and spins  how great is that  that is hypocrisy  at it's best  pointed out brilliantly  that was good  and now  uh obama's going on  o'reilly tonight 
[02:52:30]  is he  and obama has  boycotted uh  fox news  for a while  yeah  then what's he doing  i don't know why  he's just gonna do that  how could you  fucking boycott  a news station  one of two  when you don't like  the fucking point  of view they come from  you don't see republicans  boycotting every  fucking liberal media  can the fucking liberals  shut your mouths  about fox news  it's biased  conservative  yes  and you know what  a lot of the media  is biased liberal

[02:53:30]  head on it  i don't can't read it  and a d  a four  you want to log on  and and find out  if you're color blind  or not at the same time  looks like somebody  wrote it with jizz  i know  this poor son of a bitch  sitting out there  wait do you feel like  you're at a marlins game  is that what  he's alone  there's one guy  on the bleachers  yeah he looks like  pablo  nevermind  picasso  i know  exactly like him  dude what's uh  no he looks like

[02:54:30]  what are you doing down here  in uh  new york  um  we're actually uh  dog and house sitting  for somebody for a week  so i listen to you guys  every day  so i want to combine  who's we  my family  my wife and daughter  but they're not interested  oh  yeah  so they're  they're  they're  are they  house and dogs  are they sitting  right next to you  anybody  is your wife and family  sitting right next to you  it's georgina glass  right  it's the glass family  that's good  uh  before you left the house  you make sure you uh  threw away the peanut butter  yeah that's right

[02:56:30]  is a fucking twat  i just typically hear  more about fox news  being complained about  i don't hear as much  about cnn being  complained about  because people  complain about fox  i think if you're sharp  you'd do a lot better  on the stations that  are kind of against you  and a little bias  against you  as long as it's not  a taped piece  you could go on there  and just rip them apart  make them look stupid  like fucking  dummy o'reilly looked  like an idiot  contradicting himself  like that  it's fucking beautiful  i hate o'reilly  but you know why  obama's doing it 
[02:57:00]  god do i hate that guy  obama's doing it  the same reason why  fucking mccain  announced his vp  the next day  to take all the  fucking heat away  people are gonna be  watching obama tonight  people are gonna be  watching what happens  after  all the people  reviewing what he says  it's gonna be  controversy  instead of watching  mccain give his  fucking pre-written  horse shit speech  and his little arms  being pulled up  by strings  the whole time  fucking marionette  it just seems  idealistic  but should it  fucking be this way  shouldn't it just be  here's my platform

[03:07:30]  head in between their eyes very  prized very expensive there's  different types of koi you can't  just get a fish i mean certain  ones are very expensive very  prized in the japanese culture oh  yes yes like the one steve has on  on his arm maybe to some people  boring hey here comes steve steve  has one on his arm that you can  catch in the hudson river  that's the that's the point i'm  making though because you showed  off your koi tattoo steve showed  off his koi tattoo who else wow 
[03:08:00]  that is a big no koi for me  pat duffy showed off his koi tattoo  and then i think derrick has a koi  tattoo would you use a koi to cover  the boy  by the way derrick you weren't in  in here we all agree that you have  the worst tattoos known to man but  not that one that was good oh that  was all right wow that's a whole  fucking half a arm you did a half a  sleeve that's uh what is that an  octopus yeah eating what nothing  that i i had this stupid koi when i

[03:09:30]  japanese has a different thing than  chinese yeah what's the japanese koi is  that a bunch of businessmen fucking  pseudo raping a girl on a subway train  because she just wants to get on a  fucking get to work  fucking savages  we have a tiny penis we push against a  you a hiney  can only do that joke after nine o'clock  and what butcher has a koi tattoo  everybody and their mother has a damn  koi tattoo  i just got this one done

[03:10:30]  back before i did any drugs or any  alcohol  what does it say  i claimed that i was straight edge  till death  yeah cause that's the whole thing  to be straight edge forever man  yeah  till death  forever  it's like fuck you you dumb little  shit  you don't know what the fuck you  do  no drugs no drinking no  promiscuous sex just overall  clean living  and i did that for a really long  time  straight edge  and it's these little fucking  douchebag like emo dicks  that think  shut up  it wasn't cool when you did it  either  true  that think like that it's cool 
[03:11:00]  like they're different for doing  it  and then they grow up a little  and realize holy shit this pot is  good or i like beer or pussy  rules  cock is awesome  feels okay  yeah whatever you're into  steve why'd you get a koi tattoo  uh it was a cover up piece jim  uh it was a  i had awful fucking tattoos from  when i was 17 years old  and it was the  seems to be the age  yeah it's the uh  and then 10 years later you  realize wow i really don't like  this  and every tattoo artist i was  going to was telling me that  oh yeah we can do some big  tribal piece over it 
[03:11:30]  or a fucking grim reaper  and i was like no i wanted  something colorful  so i finally found a guy that  did really good cover up work  and he said the only thing that  would really go over that  would be japanese artwork  so he showed me this  big koi fish  i said yeah fuck it  do a koi fish  was it hard like to cover  because obviously  where the suggestion is to  cover the tattoo like  well we could make it into  uh  a big uh  a black oscar meyer  wiener with a hat  i mean  are you insinuating that i had a  penis tattooed on my shoulder  oh yes  clarifying let's see your uh

[03:35:00]  what's wrong E-Rock  what are you doing  with Dave's wife  what's wrong  you wanna fuck my wife  huh  you wanna fuck my wife  no  you got a lot of answers  what's wrong E-Rock  you're holding your arm  or something  no my  my hand got slammed  in the uh  oh it's crooked  he broke his hand  oh isn't that a shame  I got kicked in the ribs  and punched in the balls  eight times  because you're throwing  your shit everywhere  isn't that a shame  what happened  you got a little paper cut  huh  you got a paper cut baby  I don't know

[03:36:00]  your stomach's broken too  it's swollen  it was so unnecessary  so Dave is looking for an answer  and I think it's fair  I don't want an answer  are you trying to mingle  with my chick  no I have not played  Mario Kart with your wife  in a very very long time  why are you lying to me  I'm not lying to you  you can check 
[03:36:30]  I can check  why don't you guys share  like a shit cocktail  how do you check  and become friends again  I'll accept his apology  if he lets me put my cock  in his ear  I'm not gonna  I won't do anything  I swear to god  I won't piss or anything  you know E-Rock  it's really not a bad idea  I'm not even joking around  I will not urinate  or do anything  I gotta be honest  it's not a bad idea  cock in the ear  doesn't sound that bad  it's not a bad idea  only thing that could result  little herpy ear  but that's  that's not a big deal 
[03:37:00]  not happening  wear some ear muffins  ear muffins  whatever the fuck  they're called  it's not winter yet  anyway  Bobby you puked again  why were you puking  I don't know  shit came out of a guy's  asshole in front of me  Jim  sorry  I don't usually  that doesn't do it for me  that's not on my list  but it's funny  man it's silly  where does that go  from funny to  you have to puke  it was hilarious  let me say something  Eastside Dave  I'm a big fan 
[03:37:30]  he fucking rules  I mean the fact  that he  pulled his pants down  and said he had to go  to the bathroom  and you guys didn't listen  and then he did  actually shit his pants  he gets kudos  from me  he was making shitties  he tried to warn everybody  I always  I come into the office  I put my things down  then I go to the bathroom  to do some shitties  if I get pulled in  this is what happens  I say it time and time again  it's no offense against you  I just  I'm very healthy  I have shitties  three times a day 
[03:38:00]  like anyone else  10.30  2.30  and 6.30  I don't like shitties  I did think it was pretty funny  when he chased Eric around  with his asshole backwards  ice in a garbage bag  at the very least  it was agile  Iraq  that was great  Poe just handed over  some ice in a garbage bag  for you  yeah  ice  maybe you want shit  on the rocks  did Poe kick you  like a karate  can I get some ice  for the three cracked ribs  it always came from  the doctor's office  I'm gonna have to get  these things fucking taped up  your ribs are red 
[03:38:30]  did he give you  he kicked him  he put a fucking boot  like how'd it go  like a karate  yeah  hey Isai  what could you do with ice  you got an ice trick  yeah I'll put my ice  on my cock  and then Eric's here  that doesn't sound bad  no  it'll shrink it  what's the big deal  it's like having a marble  on your fucking ears  what if he said  Dave gives Eric  a Dan Choku driver  don't tell me  you're going the way  of Spaz  you don't want to be  known as Eric  and not E-Rock anymore  no  what happened to E-Rock  E-Rock  E-Rock  it never involved  a dick in the ear
