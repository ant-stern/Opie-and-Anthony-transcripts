<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a chaotic, vulgar skit featuring unintelligible suggestive phrases.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, immediately establish their reputation for pushing boundaries, punctuating their banter with a nonsensical chant of "We're the only one!"  A significant portion of the early show is dedicated to the comedic struggle of getting a proper station identification announcement from a caller known only as "Superfly Jimmy Snooker," resulting in repeated mispronunciations and hilarious failures.  Discussions revolve around Andrew Dice Clay's outtakes and a previous, drunken appearance on another show.  Callers contribute to the chaos: Keith recounts making a dominatrix cry by calling her "Joey Ramone," while Jersey Jim argues with the hosts about Dice Clay's allegedly repetitive material. Other callers share their excitement about winning a trip to St. Lucia thanks to an O&A chicken-launching trivia question, and the hosts promote a planned whipped cream bikini contest.

The show continues with a diverse range of calls: a listener distraught over missing a woman in a supermarket; graphic discussions surrounding the attractiveness of Angel Amy and a listener's chances with her;  plans for upcoming guests, including a Russian mobster from *The Sopranos*, topless/naked bartenders, and a call from Ted Demme (director of *Blow*); a frustrated limo driver, "Limo Anthony," complaining about a competitor; the "FU Friday" segment, brimming with angry, vulgar messages; and promotional spots for Andrew Dice Clay, Planet Java iced coffee, and other WNEW shows.  A caller shares a darkly comedic anecdote about a Chris Titus stand-up show, and a lengthy debate erupts around *Survivor*, including graphic descriptions of contestants and heated arguments about a contestant's underarm hair. Cowbell Bill is noted as being present in the studio.

A news item about *Survivor* contestant Jervis Peterson's altercation with a limo driver segues into an advertisement for Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Eddie Trunk, present in the studio, discusses his appearance on a VH1 80s hair band special, critiquing the bands' power ballads and formulaic style.  He recounts a funny anecdote about meeting Dice Clay.  The cancellation of an appearance by Buckcherry and Monster Magnet is discussed, blamed on unnamed political interference, leading to angry commentary on the music industry.  A California caller's lament about the lackluster radio scene there prompts a story about Opie's hallucinatory, sleep-deprived cross-country road trip.  Another caller describes seeing Dice Clay and wanting to confront him, but the call ends abruptly due to offensive language.  The segment culminates with the arrival of topless Bacardi bartenders in the studio. A phone interview with Ted Demme follows, focusing on *Blow*'s production, casting (Ray Liotta, Johnny Depp, Paul Reubens, Bobcat Goldthwait, Penelope Cruz), depiction of 1970s drug culture, and audience reactions. He discusses his career, from MTV's *Yo! MTV Raps* to his views on contemporary filmmaking.

Further interviews with Ted Demme continue, delving into the film's production details and his career trajectory.  The "FU Friday" segment returns, followed by a raucous studio atmosphere with topless Bacardi models, more listener calls, and off-color banter.  Alcohol is poured down a model's back, and Igor, an actor from *The Sopranos*, shares vulgar anecdotes.  A listener criticizes the show's content, leading to prank calls. Jim Cook from Sam Adams makes a brief promotional call.  Earl's poor driving skills are also discussed.

The show continues with a sound engineer playing Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone," drawing criticism from the hosts.  Several comedic phone calls, including one labeled "Asian Arnold" and another involving a real estate scam, are played.  A discussion about a riot sparks heated exchanges with callers, particularly those identifying as Black, who debate racial issues and stereotypes with the hosts.  A commercial for Victory Limousines, featuring "naked Bacardi bartenders," airs.  More discussion of the riot and police brutality ensues, interspersed with a call from Andrew Dice Clay, who is late for a show due to car trouble.  The conversation becomes dominated by Dice Clay's frantic attempts to reach his venue, interwoven with vulgar exchanges with the hosts and callers.  The show's conclusion involves listener calls summarizing what they "learned" (often crudely), plugs for comedians and events, announcements of upcoming show content, and replays of earlier segments.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts engage in highly offensive and provocative discussions involving race, gender, and other controversial topics.

[00:00:00]  We're always accused of going a little too far, aren't we?  Yeah.  Daddy, show me your monkey!  Daddy, I'm really hot.  Daddy, can I eat some meat?  Daddy, a little bit of my mouth.

[00:01:30]  It's like a wreck.  It's enough.  I thought I told you to shut up.  It's the L&A Show.  Hey.  I got sort of a kind of wine. 
[00:02:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's Friday.  What up?  I want to broadcast outside.  Screw this studio stuff.  Yeah, nice out.  Finally a spring day.  We should freak out Pete and say,  Pete, we want to broadcast from the sidewalk.  I don't know how to do that.  You think he'll get that done in the next 15 minutes?  I don't know.  On your radio dial.  I just realized Pete sounds like Jimmy Superfly Snooker. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, when he came in the office the other day.  Okay.  Sounded like okay brother.  Okay.  O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-2.7.  On 0-2.  O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-0-2-7.  Now this is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker.  And you are...  Okay, let me start.  Georgia!  That's Georgia! 
[00:03:00]  That's Georgia!  Now this is Superfly Jimmy Snooker.  And you are listening to O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-0-2-7.  On W-N-E-W.  Right again.  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2.7.  Oh!  Ask yourself!  Yeah.  We call it 1-0-2-7.  Okay.  1-0-2-7.  On W-N-E-W.  Do you want him to say his name and stuff? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, God.  Uh, you want to say it again?  Hey, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in.  So Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio dog.  Kanglick.  Thanks, man.  Okay, brother.  Kanglick.  Who needs that?  I'm never going to England.  That's a winner. 
[00:04:00]  That is too much, man.  That is the worst.  It's hard to listen to.  You're just like, bring it on home.  I guess we have some Dice outtakes today.  Oh, really?  Steve working on that?  Dice did some little promos for us.  This whole segment was an outtake yesterday.  I know.  It was funny yesterday.  It was hilarious.  Go figure that one out.  I'm trying to figure out who Bedback Blumberg is.  Bedback Blumberg.  Who?  Bedback Blumberg.  I know.  He goes off on those tears. 
[00:04:30]  You don't know what the hell he's talking about.  Keith, what's going on?  I think maybe you guys should just pack up and go on home today.  Why?  After that show I just heard, Ron and Fez special.  Oh, that was great.  Awesome.  That was a lot of fun.  I forgot about that.  How drunk did you guys want to get?  We were pretty hammered.  Hammered.  It was late night.  It's when Ron and Fez were on after, well, late night.  That was after our penthouse signing, I believe.  Yes.  So, do you guys like to do your coke off the mirror or is the table okay?  Nice.  I can't believe I made a dominatrix cry in league. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, that makes no sense.  Everyone was amazed at that.  How the hell do you make a dominatrix cry?  She's a dominatrix.  I think you have a little backbone if you're a dominatrix.  Yeah.  No.  I hope he insulted her.  What exactly did you say?  You think I remember?  I don't either.  He called her Joey Ramone.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Joey Ramone.  That was it.  Well, I guess that's a reason to cry if you're a girl.  Take my whip and go home.  You know, thinking about it, it must be pretty horrible to look like Joey Ramone. 
[00:05:30]  You guys know anybody who looks like him?  No.  Besides that dominatrix?  Nothing I could put my finger on.  No, me neither.  Me neither.  No.  All right, guys.  Be good.  Bye, Keith.  Let's go to Jersey Jim.  Jersey Jim, what's going on, buddy?  Hello.  Jersey.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, listen.  What's with Dice with this bad back thing?  It was a bit of his like seven years ago.  Oh, bad back, uh, Blumberg?  Whatever.  Yeah, it was on his double album.  It was an hour back, get it.  I mean, the guy can't even come up with new material. 
[00:06:00]  All right, Jersey Jim.  Yeah.  We got to stick with the facts here.  We don't mind abusing people on this show, but Dice had a lot of new stuff yesterday,  and he was hilarious.  Oh, I knew that.  The guy was funny as hell.  I'm one of his biggest fans, but he's trying to push that off like it's, like it's  new material when it's eight years old.  He never said he was trying to push it as a new thing.  Well, you guys didn't know what it was.  Well, because I heard it.  Because I didn't buy all the Dice CDs.  Well, I guess I'm a bigger fan then, huh?  All right.  Yeah, good for you.  But he wasn't acting like he just came up with that. 
[00:06:30]  That would be pretty stupid, don't you think?  Yeah, I guess so.  When there's a record of it on a CD somewhere?  Yeah, he's got, it's a double CD.  I think it was a live album he did back in like 90, 91.  Yeah.  Might have been the year 92.  The hour back edit, it's a whole big routine about a guy with a humpback.  Are you going to Westbury Music Fair?  I'm trying to scout tickets right now.  I've been on the phone all day trying to get tickets.  I can't get through.  Yeah, it's really busy over there for some reason.  Well, good.  We're all going tomorrow night, so we'll see you there.  All right.  All right, buddy.  Take care. 
[00:07:00]  Bye.  Someone is saying they're psyched to see Otto and George today?  Wow.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yeah, I'm going up to Poughkeepsie tonight to see Otto and George.  Oh, all right.  I thought you were psyched to see him on our show or something.  No, no, no.  Tonight, I'm just going to go up there and say hello to you, to them, for you guys,  and have a good time with them.  Poughkeepsie.  I mean, we love Otto and George, but why would you call us to tell us that you're excited  to see Otto and George?  Because they're a part of your show a lot.  In Poughkeepsie.  Yeah, but you haven't even told anyone where they're going to be. 
[00:07:30]  Bananas in Poughkeepsie?  Where else?  All right, that helps.  I'm not knowing around the streets of Poughkeepsie.  All right?  All right.  You effing whore.  Bill, what's going on?  Yo, who's that guy happy-faced, that moron?  How could you stand that dude, man?  How do you let him in the studio?  He makes me chuckle.  He does?  Yeah.  He's so obnoxious.  He defends Dice with his life.  And he's kind of weird like that.  Does he do like stand-up or anything?  He's so annoying that he makes me chuckle. 
[00:08:00]  What can I tell you?  That's cool.  And he's like umpteenth degree black belt.  So what are you going to do?  Yeah, you can't mess with the guy.  Oh, really?  Nah, you just got to kill you.  You got to kind of take it.  What happened with club soda?  I don't know.  Oh, he couldn't catch him?  Nah, he's not working with the Dice Man anymore.  Really?  But things are cool.  They're still friends and all.  Oh, that's good.  Yo, what's up, T.S. Produce?  Talk to you later, fellas.  I miss him.  I want to broadcast from the sidewalk.  Is Pete even here?  Nope.  Day off?  Is his day off?  How can an engineer at a station have like a day off like that without a replacement? 
[00:08:30]  Because it's like, it's a very holy day today, Anthony.  It's a good Friday, Anthony.  Good Friday.  You can't eat stuff, I think.  That's why Ron and Fez were off today.  For Good Friday.  No, no, no.  They haven't had a vacation since they started, so they picked this weekend.  They took Good Friday?  Yeah.  Are they in next week?  They're taking Monday off.  Oh, four-day weekend.  They need a long weekend to recharge the batteries.  I thought they were really religious and decided to take the day off.  That kind of shook me up a bit. 
[00:09:00]  They don't seem like the religious type.  The Catholic Church.  Hey.  Robert, what's going on?  Yeah, O&A.  I'm very, very upset at the present time.  I'm very close to slitting my wrist right now.  Why?  Dude, I went shopping today.  I was going out doing some stuff.  I seen this awesome, beautiful girl on the checkout line.  I'm trying to go tell the cashier, listen, here's a hundred bucks.  Keep the change.  Just blow me out of here quick so I can, like, synchronize, you know, leaving at the same time. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, she turns the corner and I just go to get my change and the girl's gone.  And I'm like, I got a brand new Ferrari in my garage and I can't even drive it now.  I'm all upset.  Wait, I just missed something.  You were online at a supermarket?  I'm at a supermarket, A&P in Saddlebrook.  Your girl was...  You ditched the food and go.  Dude, I gave the lady a hundred dollars.  I almost dropped everything.  Listen to me.  If it wasn't my little puppy's dog food, I would have left without it.  But I had to feed my pups.  Robert, you're the stupid one.  Yeah.  You should just have left. 
[00:10:00]  You should have just left.  You didn't have to hand the lady a hundred dollars.  You just leave all your food on that little conveyor belt thing and then you move on.  Go off to her.  She blows you off.  And then you go back and get your food.  Dude, we can't like put a message out for this girl.  What's more important, the dog food or the girl that dreams?  The broad.  Then you leave.  The broad.  That's nice.  The girl of my dreams.  That broad.  I can't even fire her up in peace over here.  I can't even get stalled, man.  Yeah, I can't.  And I got my Ferrari.  I can't even get it ready to go for a ride because I'm all screwed up now. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I'm sure you have a Ferrari.  You have a Ferrari.  Dude, you wanted that?  How about if we put some money on it?  Dude, I'm serious.  I'm a Ferrari mechanic.  I build my own cars.  I just sold my private helicopter.  I'm not a...  Yeah, okay.  Boy, I was believing him right up until the helicopter.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just got to give you guys the biggest thank you.  Because of you two, I won a trip to St. Lucia today.  How'd you do that?  How the hell did that happen?  All right.  Don't think I'm a faggot.  I was listening to G100 this morning.  Faggot.  Faggot. 
[00:11:00]  Thanks.  Anyway, and they had some contest.  They're like, the question was, this thing, its longest place span ever was 13 seconds.  Chris.  Yeah.  Why are you calling us to tell us that another station gave you a trip?  Why?  Because I listened to an old skit on Foundry Music about you guys launching a chicken off  a roof to try and break the record.  Right.  By the way, a DJ copied that stunt and got arrested and thrown in jail.  Yep.  Oh, yeah?  Didn't know how to do it the right way.  What an idiot.  Nice.  Well, because of that, I learned on that that the chicken's longest place span ever was 13 seconds. 
[00:11:30]  And that was the question.  Because of that, I won a trip to St. Lucia.  So, great.  G100's giving away trips.  Well, I want to say thank you, guys.  I gave you guys a big plug on their station.  Because of you, I win the trip.  Because you guys are the best.  Great.  You just make us look pathetic by telling everyone you want a trip somewhere else.  Well, we are pathetic because we can't come up with trips.  We don't like people pointing it out.  Exactly.  Well, actually, no.  Half the guys on the station, when they were getting all my information, were like, yeah,  like, they're the best.  We all listen to them here anyway.  Well, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  I thought I'd say thank you, guys.  Because if I didn't listen to you, I wouldn't have known the answer to that.  All right.  Have fun with the trip that G100 gave you.  Oh, great.  Great.  Thanks, guys.  And we found out that we didn't get our paperwork in time for our trip for the whipped cream  bikini contest, right?  They didn't get our paperwork in time?  I'm not sure about that.  Oh, brother.  All right.  Well, all right.  All right.  We'll stick with the facts.  You know, the whipped cream bikini contest starts a week from Monday.  Hope the girls realize that.  Come down with your body.  We'll have whipped cream and all sorts of stuff to decorate your body. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, because it's almost like we gave them the trip.  What?  The G100 trip?  Yeah.  To St. Lucia.  All right.  It's like we gave them the trip.  We can't get crap.  Dylan, what's going on?  Dylan.  Yo, what's up?  I got two things to say.  First of all, wasn't Jay Moore supposed to be on Regis and Kelly?  That's next Thursday.  Next Thursday.  Yep.  Regis is going away all next week, and Jay Moore will be the guest host Thursday on  Regis and Kelly.  All week?  No.  Next Thursday.  Okay. 
[00:13:00]  My second question.  I was listening to Ron and Fez yesterday.  Yeah.  I mean, well, a couple hours ago, right?  Yeah.  And I was wondering, do you think I would ever have a chance of banging Angel Amy?  No, I'm kind of hot.  Who cares?  But I'm just asking.  It's Friday.  Dylan.  Yeah?  Have you seen Angel Amy?  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Let me strap in.  What does she look like?  I'm going to strap in.  She's ordinary.  Nothing going on.  Well, did you hear her?  She has that light lift thing.  And no checks with that give the best comers, bro. 
[00:13:30]  She's got a uni-brow.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you can shave that.  Work through it, bro.  She's still a teenager.  She's got a little hair under her lip.  I'm a teenager, too.  Oh, my God.  And she has no boobs.  What size?  Yeah, she's hot.  Okay, but looking at her, what size?  What's the cup size?  I don't know.  Like, minus A.  Dude, what's the point?  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Later.  All right.  Wow.  Just pops into his bubble.  Yeah.  You ever see the top of a volcano, how it goes in? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Or they're so small, they go in.  But who cares about her little life?  I certainly don't.  Oh, my God.  That was brutal.  A little angry.  He thought he was upset today.  What?  What's going on?  All right, so today on the show, we got the Russian mobster from The Sopranos coming in. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  Not even a phoner.  That's really a step up now for us.  I think he's already here, right?  Igor, whatever his name is.  Igor.  We got topless bartenders coming in, or naked bartenders.  That's good.  Cool.  They better be naked.  Because that fell apart last week, so we're making good on that.  Or the Friday before we went on vacation.  Are they naked or topless?  Today, I think they're going to be completely naked.  Because if they say topless, you know what that means?  They come in with bras on.  No, these girls will be naked, I guarantee you. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  We're not going to fail twice.  And then we got Ted Demme calling in to say, hey, the director of Blow.  Nice.  Saw Blow last night.  Not bad.  Not bad?  Not bad.  Or good?  Good.  Uh-oh.  I'm hearing a little motivation in the voice.  It was all right.  Looks like it.  It's a really good story, but, you know, they try to cover, like, three decades, so it's tough  to get a lot of info out.  Mm-hmm.  They could have went into a little more detail about this guy and his relationships and how  he was smuggling the drugs into the United States. 
[00:15:30]  How was Pee-wee?  He was great.  Really?  Honestly, God, he was great.  So the rebirth of Paul Rubens, you think?  Yeah, without a doubt.  Big comeback?  You're going to see him all over the place.  As a character actor, he's great.  What's that, Ben?  Are you just saying he's gay?  In the movie?  In the movie, he's gay.  Oh, in the movie.  Okay.  He's a gay hairdresser.  In real life.  I don't know if he's gay.  Whatever.  I mean, he was great.  He really was really, really good.  Johnny Depp, an amazing actor.  Yeah.  He put a great performance.  And Penelope Cruz.  Oh, God.  Good God.  Nice? 
[00:16:00]  Nice.  Don't even have to say it.  Nice.  It's ridiculously nice.  Uh, 212-757-1027.  Billy Mack, what's going on?  What'd you guys do to Paul Limo Anthony yesterday?  What do you mean?  Well, he's on suicide alert.  I heard from him.  He's, uh, you guys were advertising a different limo company.  Well, see, I know, I know.  I still have to call him.  He called my house last night, uh, pouting and crying.  Oh, he did?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's mad at Ben.  Why?  I don't know.  Something about tickets to the WWF and not picking you up on Sunday and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:16:30]  Well, see, the advertisement for that new limo company was just a coincidence yesterday.  But, of course, we pushed it to the limit.  I can't tell of that.  It was very vital that you called victory?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that might have been a little macho.  And they have top-notch service.  Right.  They do, but they don't have people that speak English.  Eh, we'll work it out with them.  All right, guys.  We have been pushing them a little too hard lately, so.  I know.  I think he's, I really think you pushed him to the brink, though.  I think he's reached his limit.  I don't know.  He lost a couple of courts of blood, too.  Eh, we'll talk to him. 
[00:17:00]  He's been in the barrel, and the top's been, like, welded on.  Yeah.  There's no way out.  What are we going to do?  We had an advertisement to do for a nice limo company.  Well, absolutely.  You'll turn it down because of Anthony?  Well, no, of course not.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  There you go.  No hard feelings.  See you guys next week with Jay Moore.  All right.  Bye-bye.  But, see, limo Anthony doesn't understand why no one's calling because he's confusing everybody.  Yeah.  He owns a limo company, but he works for another one.  And he plugs the other one.  And he plugs the other one, and he doesn't understand why no one's calling his. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  He plugs Vital, right?  Because he does work.  And he's top-notch.  He does work hard, and he's a small limo company, but he works for a bigger company, and he promotes the bigger company.  That's only giving him a paycheck.  And his livelihood depends on top-notch limousines.  Right.  But no one calls that because he's too busy plugging Vital limousines.  And everyone gets confused in the process.  Yeah.  And then he calls me, bitching and complaining, because he's doing a lot of good stuff for the show and getting no business.  It's bad business for him, the way he's handling it.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Top-notch limousine is the one he owns, I believe.  Top-notch, yeah.  But he works for Vital.  See?  It don't make sense.  Who do you call?  Who do you call?  Ghostbusters.  All right.  We've got to take a break and try to figure out a radio show today.  All right.  212-757-1027.  Do we have the FU line hooked up?  Yep.  Where are we going with that?  Over here?  Yeah.  You sure?  Go.  Thanks for calling.  No. 
[00:18:30]  Hold on.  Now try it.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.  Yeah, this FU goes to Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  I want you to fix the f***ing potholes on the built parkway, you prick.  Instead of worrying about closing down the sex shops, closing down the food vendors.  Well, it was a change of my time in the built parkway in the f***ing rain because your f***ing  baby beluga whale head or comb up a motherf***ing ass personality wouldn't fix the f***ing potholes,  dickhead.  Next message. 
[00:19:00]  FU to every livery driver in New York.  These black cars go 40 miles an hour if they're in front of you and they ride your ass if they're behind you.  FU to every livery driver in New York.  Next message.  Yeah, I got an FU for you guys.  Yeah, FU to George Bush giving out an apology to China.  I got an apology for you.  I'm sorry we didn't build self-destruction to our planes.  End of message.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what are you doing?  I'm over here now.  Andrew Dice Clay. 
[00:19:30]  And you're with me and I'm with you and we're on 102.7.  WNEW.  I'm over here now because everybody said like this.  Uh-huh.  1027.  WNEW is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  It's the Radio Chick.  A little game called singing with your mouth full.  We've got our lifters lined up ready to help you, Suzanne.  You will stick an object in your mouth.  Moving along and cylindrical.  You will try and sing a song without removing the object from your mouth. 
[00:20:00]  And if they can identify it, you get the point.  Let's all call out tomorrow.  Let's all call out tomorrow.  I'm going to let her keep singing.  Radio Chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon.  1027.  WNEW.  Call toll-free 1-866-4-A-R-B-R-O-S.  That's 1-866-4-A-R-B-R-O-S.  Service beyond the call.  I am...  Passes and surcharges still apply. 
[00:20:30]  God, I hate the end of that commercial.  Cut that off.  Jesus.  Uh-oh.  There you go.  Make a new one.  Uh, Anthony, Planet Java.  Finally, iced coffee just got cold.  It's Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Planet Java, it ain't no social drink.  It's iced coffee that lets you be yourself.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  They've hit the streets and they're coming to the area near you.  With cool new flavors like Javadelic, Trimble, and Caramoca. 
[00:21:00]  Javadelic's like a grown-up milkshake.  The perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  And then Caramoca.  It's like chocolate, caramel, and coffee.  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  And it's a great mixer if you want to booze it up.  And Trimble, if you want an extra kick, it's got 121 milligrams of caffeine.  It's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  So students, truckers, moms, anyone who needs a boost is going to love this one.  Trimble does the trick deliciously.  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  And available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, say, hey, get Planet Java. 
[00:21:30]  Iced coffee just got cool.  And it's called Planet Java.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie, I have them for me.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1027.  WNEW.  ONA, Cowbell Bill in the studio. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, how do you?  I'm trying to get something going here.  212-757-1027 is the phone number.  We'll try the phones again here before we give up for the day.  Patty, what's up?  Opie?  Anthony, everyone.  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Good.  I met Anthony last night at the Chris Titus show.  Yeah, I went to the Titus show at Caroline's.  Oh, was that your girlfriend with you?  Yeah.  Oh, she's very pretty.  Thank you.  We had a lot of fun.  It was very funny last night. 
[00:22:30]  What did you think of Chris?  Oh, he's great, but it's so sad what he went through.  And, you know, it just really sucks.  But, you know what?  It worked out for him.  I don't know how you turned that into comedy.  What was he telling his family stories?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was terrible.  When he said about his mother killing herself?  His mother finally, like, goes through all these institutions, and she's drunk and everything.  She kills one of her husbands, and then she's going to get some help.  She gets out of this institution, and you think everything's going to be hunky-dory, 
[00:23:00]  or maybe they have some kind of relationship.  He goes, and that's when she shot herself in the head and killed herself.  The whole place went dead silent.  Dead silent.  Oh, my God.  And it's like, whoa, he just ran into a brick wall.  But then he comes back and something that makes you start laughing again.  Oh, my God.  He was great.  He was great.  And then we watched him on Conan when we got home, and he did the same thing.  And the audience on the Conan show was dead.  They weren't even laughing.  They were all, like, stupid.  You know what?  I'm so bummed they didn't go to the show now.  It was good.  That's right down my alley.  I could appreciate stuff like that. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, you should have went.  We're on our way to go see Blow now, Opie, but we're not going to miss it,  because we're on the Southern State, and the traffic sucks, man.  It's terrible.  You're going to see what?  Blow.  Oh, Blow?  Yeah, what you saw last night.  No, I know.  I didn't hear you at first.  Yeah, it was a pretty good movie.  Yeah, well, Titus was great.  And we're going to go see Jay Moore next week.  We can't wait to see him.  So I hope to see both of you there.  We'll be at the Jay Moore show.  We'll be at the Dye show this weekend.  We're going to see Buck Cherry and Monster Magnet on Monday at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  Very busy next couple of weeks. 
[00:24:00]  And Brewer's coming to Caroline's.  And Brewer, I think, is coming to Caroline's after Jay's there.  Yep.  Well, that's when we met you, Opie, at the Irving class,  and we were out on the line, freezing our asses off.  Irving class.  For the Brewer show?  Yeah, at Irving class.  And when you guys recorded it, we met you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was a very cold night.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  It was freezing.  But it was worth it.  All right, Patty.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a great holiday.  You too.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Also, Brian Regan coming to Rascals. 
[00:24:30]  I think Rascals.  Tickets are going to go fast for that show, too.  I'm warning you now.  These guys are hot, hot, hot lately.  Titus was really good.  And then he's talking about his appearance on Conan.  And he was telling some of these stories, and the audience just goes like, ooh.  And he's like, hey, wait a minute.  Conan just did a bit where they tied a baby to a brick and, like, threw it somewhere.  Yeah.  And he's like, yeah, and people are laughing at that.  Why can't they laugh at the fact that his mother killed herself?  Because one's fake and one's real.  Right. 
[00:25:00]  Exactly.  But that makes it so good.  And it's so uncomfortable.  I love that uncomfortable feeling when you're in an audience like that.  Everyone just shut up when he said that.  And then all the stories about his father just, like, so abusive.  And just anything he did, any little accomplishment he made, his father would just beat him into the ground about it.  No one had the balls to do the Robert De Niro laugh from the back of Caroline to the middle of that stuff?  You know something?  I was thinking that right when everyone just went silent, when he was talking about his mom killing himself.  Just somebody go, hey, hey, hey, are you ready to laugh? 
[00:25:30]  Because it was really uncomfortable.  So it wasn't stand-up.  It was, what, like a one-man show type thing?  One-man show type thing.  Yeah.  He didn't carry a mic.  He had a little clip on mic, and he just paced the stage like a lunatic and tells stories about his dysfunctional, beyond dysfunctional, family life.  I'd recommend it, though.  Really good.  Now, did his mom kill his real father, or was it another husband?  No.  No, it was his stepfather.  Like, yeah, one of her husbands.  It was Thanksgiving, he said.  And he said his mother put the turkey out at a quarter after four, and her husband thought it should be out at four. 
[00:26:00]  And threw the turkey at her.  So she picked up a boiling pot of potatoes and threw that at him, and he proceeded to punch her face in.  Yeah.  And you're sitting there like, okay.  So then she goes upstairs, grabs a gun, and shoots the guy.  And his sister's there, and as, you know, she's screaming, should we get it there?  And he was like, wait a minute. 
[00:26:30]  Hold on a few minutes.  Yeah, let's figure out what we're going to do here.  God, I wish I was there.  Yeah, it was.  It was a good time.  It was uncomfortable, but funny as hell.  I don't know how he does it.  So where's his real father then?  His real father's, I guess, still alive in California.  He's had, like, four heart attacks, he said.  But, you know, he's still saying, don't be a wussy to the guy, you know?  Cool.  Yeah, good show.  All right.  Howie, what's going on?  Oh, tough to talk after hearing that story.  Jesus Christ.  That's a great story. 
[00:27:00]  Good job.  Oh, taking Amber, getting thrown off last night, man.  Yeah.  I'm a mess with Survivor.  How did you know?  I didn't know.  I thought Elizabeth was getting the point.  Oh, I thought you were abusing me.  No, I thought Elizabeth was gone.  You said yesterday it was Amber, no?  No.  Oh, wow.  The last three weeks I was convinced I knew who was getting kicked off.  I haven't called one yet.  No.  Do you think CBS planted the rice on that piece of wood or it really floated there?  Thank you.  I said that to Sandy last night.  You're kidding.  No, I swear to God.  They had torrential downpours on Survivor last night and these stupid idiots, they put their 
[00:27:30]  camp on a dry riverbed.  Yeah.  So, obviously, the water came just, you know, flowing down and took their camp away or most  of their camp.  And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, the CBS camera guy is on the rice that they gave  them last week because they ran out of food in a big tent and they're just focusing on  the rice and there you see it just starting to, you know, more and more water and it just  goes downstream.  They won't touch it.  I said to Sandy, they put it in this perfect place.  They had to have. 
[00:28:00]  Yep.  Yep.  I'm telling my wife, listen to me.  CBS guys put it there just for more drama.  Without a doubt, because this, I mean, it was a ridiculous river.  It would have just kept going and going, but they placed it perfectly, kind of, you know,  where there's a log and stuff where they would be able to get to it, but it would be a pain  in the ass.  He was hardcore going after it, though, man.  He's so hungry.  And Tina, who needs to gain weight because, man, now it's very obvious that she has breast  implants.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, nothing worse than when they get skinny.  Holy, yeah.  You can see the bags right through the skin.  You know, I thought she was kind of hot for, like, a middle-aged lady, but now she's got 
[00:28:30]  to get some freaking meat on those bones.  She's like skin and bones and these big breast implants.  It's disgusting.  You can read the labels on the silicone bags.  Right, right, right.  Nip.  If they have any more physical challenges, Colby's going to win them all because he's  got all the strength.  I don't know what they're going to do.  You know, I applaud CBS just when you think you know what's going to happen.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  I thought Elizabeth was gone or Roger was gone.  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.  I'm going to tune in.  Was it close?  Was it close to Elizabeth getting in? 
[00:29:00]  Way in the box.  She didn't even get a vote.  No?  Roger.  It was Roger had two and, I don't know, whatever.  Good call.  The one thing I'm noticing about these girls, though, after they leave Survivor.  Yeah.  After they lose the tan, they're not as hot.  Oh, when they lose the tan?  Yeah, they're not as hot.  Well, Kimmy was hot.  She's tanning, though.  Yeah, true.  She had a nice tan, yes.  Now Kimmy's going to call.  Kimmy, you're beautiful.  All right, trust me.  I'm just saying, like Amber this morning with, on CBS this morning, doesn't look as hot without 
[00:29:30]  the tan.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Something to be said about, you know, sunning yourself until you get skin cancer.  Oh, is Paul going to ruin it?  What?  Because I think Elizabeth's hot on Life 4.  Uh, Paul, what's going on?  Dude, I got a root in it.  What?  Did you see the hair underneath Elizabeth's armpits last night when she was doing the things?  All right, look, I'm going to defend Elizabeth.  Oh.  Dude, it was like black hair.  But that's not how she is in real life. 
[00:30:00]  So maybe she missed a date.  That's not how she is in real life.  I know.  I don't even think any of them have a razor.  Like the first Survivor, one guy had a razor.  Was it Sean, that annoying F?  Yeah, he brought his own razor.  Who wants to be a star so bad?  Sean, it's over.  Trust me.  What?  Walks around Manhattan.  Ben and I have seen him about 10 or 12 times.  He's just hoping people notice him.  Yeah, we noticed you, Sean.  You're a tool.  Who's worse, him or the real world Seattle guy?  Oh, what's his name? 
[00:30:30]  David.  Loser.  Real world David.  Remember the Mr. Muscle guy who has his shirt off all the time?  You see him at certain events, and he just thinks he is the S.  Right.  See, Sean, like now that we have a new Survivor, no one really cares about the first cast.  Okay.  Your time is over.  I think that's why the big brother people feel good.  I don't think there's going to be another one.  He's such a tool for talking about that lovely chick from Long Island, News 12. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Just to keep his fame going.  Yes, Paul?  Are you guys going to get Amber on, or is CBS pretty much banning you guys from talking to any castaways?  You know, I don't care.  We don't need any more Survivor castaways.  We, you know, we're happy we did what we did with Jerry the other day.  No, yeah, definitely.  And Kimmy sounds like a little derping.  And Kimmy's going to be on our show.  Actually, I think Jeff's coming by next week from Survivor.  Nice.  See, if you can ask him how Keith spends all of his money, because Keith's winning this whole thing for fun.  I don't know. 
[00:31:30]  Now I'm starting to think Tina.  No, no, no.  Because what happens now is they alienated Colby, so Colby's going to tell up with Roger and Elizabeth,  they're going to boot out Tina, then they're going to boot out Keith.  I think it's coming down to Tina and Keith.  And then it's who those guys, you know, want.  Nah.  Whatever.  All right.  The stupid jury.  Bye, tools.  All right.  Bye.  Dave from Heights says,  I don't care, I'll floss my teeth with Elizabeth's pit hair if she wanted me to.  Elizabeth's beautiful, man. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah?  Yeah?  She's just spectacular.  Damn bitch got engaged.  Another one from the reality shows is Jervis, who just like, anytime I see him on TV, I'm like,  come on, enough Jervis.  Who cares?  He's not like Sean.  Sean like wants to be famous so bad.  It's so sad.  But Rick and Sean shared the same woman.  Oh, no.  What?  What was this?  What was Rick going? 
[00:32:30]  Who was that?  Rick knows like Sean's ex-girlfriend.  Oh, yeah?  Rick kind of dated the same girl that Billy Joel did.  Oh, that chick?  The Billy Joel, uh...  The hot chick with the BJ lips.  The nice drag.  She's got a nice drag.  She has a nice drag in that lower lip.  A nice drag.  Yes.  Really, Rick?  Nice.  Nice.  Was she always a woman to you?  All right. 
[00:33:00]  Rick doesn't want to say anything.  He knows it out pretty well.  Friday night, he crashed her party.  Saturday, he said he was sorry.  Joe, what's going on?  How are they?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yo, Amber looks so hot today on Regis.  She's definitely a good-looking girl, but she was hotter on the show with the tan, is all  I'm saying.  I'd bang her.  That's true.  Freaking Regis.  God.  Regis.  Regis.  A little tip to Regis.  We said it last week.  The guy obviously doesn't watch the show.  Just let...  He has no idea what's going on. 
[00:33:30]  And Kelly watches the show.  Just let Kelly interview Amber, and you just sit there and nod, because everything that  came out of his mouth this morning, he sounded ridiculous.  How do you put up with those drill instructors?  My God.  With all the yelling on that show.  I mean, how hard could it be for him to watch, like, knowing you have Amber coming on, watch  Survivor the night before, or get a tape from CBS while they're putting your makeup on, to  just kind of understand the show and what's going on.  I can't understand it.  He stares in the cans all the time. 
[00:34:00]  It's all he does.  I try to watch.  I don't understand.  But what is this?  They're chained together?  How about...  I hate you, P.N.  All right, so thanks.  You hear what Amber said on Regis and Kelly this morning?  They all shared one toothbrush.  Ooh.  Interesting.  Oh, that is disgusting.  Sharing pyreia.  Nice, nice.  But she said she didn't use the toothbrush.  She just used the toothpaste that they also got.  So you were voted off.  Why didn't you phone a friend?  Right.  You should have told the audience. 
[00:34:30]  Tony.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Can I give you two quick funnies?  Yeah.  One, Kelly Rip's belly looks like she has a baby bottle nipple on her stomach.  You look at it closely lately.  The pop-up timer belly button.  You guys noticed everything I noticed today.  Dude, and Elizabeth looks like she has a troll doll in a headlock with those armpit heads.  Yeah, but, you know, that's not how she looks in the real world.  Yeah, I know.  She's hot, man.  You've got to give her a little, you know, a little break there.  But the Kelly freaking belly button this morning, holy ass. 
[00:35:00]  That's what happens to pregnant women.  Yeah, but you wear something that doesn't...  Dude, she had a tight shirt on, and it was just like...  I'm thinking straight out like this.  This is how Kelly Rip will look this morning.  Really?  It was disgusting.  Tony's right on it.  A belly nugget.  It's like tape it down or wear something else, so it, you know...  Forgot to say hi to Mr. Hillcock there.  Get the guy to...  Bill Hillcock.  Hillcock.  All right, quickie.  Dude, I wasn't at the game, but I know my friend's not lying because he's not a fan of your show. 
[00:35:30]  He's like, Tony, a bunch of chicks pulling their shirts off at the Met game, and everybody's screaming, wow.  Cool.  So I hope you're tuning in.  All right.  Later, boys.  Later, Hillcock.  Bye, Tony.  They ought to get the guy from boot camp, the balloon guy, to twist Kelly Rip's belly button into a poodle.  That'd be interesting, right?  The balloon guy from boot camp.  We got to get him in the studio and...  That was the funniest thing. 
[00:36:00]  And wake him in the F up.  Last week, he's there.  They have a mission, and if they complete the mission, they get one item from this box of personal effects that they brought with them to this island.  And there was a bunch of people saying, I want a picture of my wife.  I want a picture of my kids.  You know, something sentimental that they could put on their night table.  The balloon guy goes, and what would you like?  They asked him.  He goes, my balloons.  With his brace mouth and everything.  He's got the brace.  My balloons.  And then they won the mission. 
[00:36:30]  And they're all celebrating in this little rec room, I guess.  And he's twisting little balloon hats for everybody.  Would you put one of those on?  And the rest of the people are wearing them.  Like, he'd put this superhero helmet and a utility belt thing, and the guy's flying around the room.  And then the sergeant's walking.  The drill instructor's talking.  What are you doing?  Private fire.  Get off my obstacle.  Love in the boot camp.  Yeah, that is a good show.  But they effed up that show. 
[00:37:00]  What?  Myers.  Yeah, they booted off one of the funniest guys on the show.  Annoying as hell.  I know he effed himself.  But somehow they had to figure out to keep him on that show because he was too good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fake and feigning so he doesn't have to work.  Oh, I don't want that guy on.  And admitting it.  Has that crazy look in his eyes.  Gets up and gives his speech.  Want to say, I have no hard feelings for anybody.  He's like at this, like he's reading it.  Yeah.  He's reading the cue card because he's so fake. 
[00:37:30]  He's just the biggest phony.  But he was entertaining at least.  All right.  A pad checking in for a port show.  I've got to love Opie's visual jokes.  When you do the belly button or the nips.  Yeah, but.  The little nubs on the girls when they first start popping.  But see, I do it to get the reaction out of you guys.  And then people could kind of understand what's going on because it'd look like this.  If you want to play along at home, take your shirt by your belly button and pull a nub up on your shirt by your belly button and then squeeze it with your fingers so it pops out. 
[00:38:00]  It's a little.  Yeah, look.  I'm doing it.  The belly button nuggie.  Now that I've been like working out again, I can't do like the little nub boobs anymore.  Oh, my God.  He squeezes the little nub.  Melissa.  Oh, look.  What?  He's got a little pop right there.  Little nubbins.  Nubbins.  Looks like a plunger.  Hey, who's this?  This is Danilo.  What's up?  Who?  Danilo.  What's a Danilo?  Angel Amy's boyfriend. 
[00:38:30]  Angel Amy's boyfriend.  Oh, you're Angel Amy's boyfriend?  Yes, I am.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Not much.  I was listening before and you kind of.  I know you don't think that way about Amy, but you just kind of went with the hype and, you know, trashed her anyway.  What's up?  You know.  Oh, you're trying to defend, um, you know.  Yeah, well, yes, I am.  That's noble, Opie.  That's noble.  He's calling up to defend his check.  Yeah, but like, is it going to matter a year from now when you're banging another broad, though?  Uh, I don't see that happening.  That's why I'm calling right now.  Oh, yeah, okay, okay. 
[00:39:00]  How old are you?  I'm 21.  And this is it for you, right?  No, come on.  Don't turn this anywhere, Opie.  Come on.  No, I'm asking you.  You called, but I'll play with you.  Is this it?  I leave the present, you know.  I don't think about the future just yet, so.  You want to make a bet that you'll be banging more broads a year from now?  Uh, this is not the point where I called.  What?  You wanted to defend her.  I'm just playing along here.  When she was in the studio, you were like, oh, I don't see any.  I see two eyebrows that, you know, people see the other way, but, you know. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, hey, bro, bro.  Yeah, go ahead.  Your girlfriend has one eyebrow.  You know that.  She's right in front of me.  I don't see that.  Is she crying?  She always cries.  No, she's fine.  She wasn't even listening that I told her.  What'd she say?  You better call and defend my honor?  Listen.  Come on now.  I am the man who will fight for your honor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, what do you want to say about Amy?  Oh, come on now, Opie.  No, I'm giving you a chance. 
[00:40:00]  She's not out about what you said.  She's lovely, you know.  She's cute.  She's great.  She needs a lot of attention because her real daddy left her.  She's got a stepfather who doesn't really pay as much attention to her as the real father would.  I mean, I mean, she almost chased her out.  Because whatever happened on the Ron and Pat show, I mean, you know, that was kind of ridiculous.  But I don't care anymore.  She's milking one stupid line that I said to her like months ago.  That was you.  Right. 
[00:40:30]  Like.  She tells everyone, I'm the girl that Ann said, you know, do you think I care about you?  Who cares?  Nobody.  You know?  All right.  You did a good job defending her.  All right.  I'll see you later.  You guys going to have sex?  Does she give it up or what?  I don't want to talk about that.  What does she give up?  I don't want to talk about it.  By the way, that guy, whatever his cold name was, Dylan, you're a douchebag. 
[00:41:00]  Dylan.  Douchebag.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  You got your green card yet?  I'm legal.  Don't worry about it.  I'm good to see all your dogs going.  Maybe that's why he's with Amy.  You're looking to hook up so you can start in the future.  Hey, just call.  Could you do me a favor?  Me?  Yeah.  When you're banging another broad, call us up and say, hey, you guys were right. 
[00:41:30]  All right?  Don't bet on that, Opie.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Don't you realize you did something bad just now?  Come on.  Can you give in, Adler?  Realize you did something bad, Opie.  Realize it.  Who did what?  Where?  Yeah, right.  Right.  That's your attitude.  I did something where?  Did we give him dice tickets?  We gave him dice tickets?  No.  Oh.  What, you want to give him dice tickets as a bunch?  All right.  You're a good kid there, so. 
[00:42:00]  Thanks, man.  Have a great weekend.  You too.  Have a nice holiday.  All right.  All right.  I respect that.  There you go.  Look, see.  Sticking up for his girl.  That's cool.  Calling up.  Sticking up for his chick.  Dolan, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey.  Pretty good.  Listen, you guys are busting on that port.  The balloon guy from boot camp.  Did you see the freaking balloons that he made?  That's why we're busting on him.  It's like, hello.  Why don't you go outside and get some sun?  Can you imagine the woman he could make for you?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  That's probably what he does at home.  He could make a wonderful balloon chick.  Donnie, are you from Jersey?  Yes, I am.  And you're not embarrassed that that guy's representing Jersey on boot camp?  He doesn't represent Jersey.  Oh, come on.  When I see, like, Kimmy from Long Island, I was like, please.  And then when Kimmy was annoying that first episode of Survivor, I was kind of embarrassed  being from Long Island.  But then it turns out Kimmy was very cool.  He represents the Jewish man.  That's about it.  Oof.  Wow.  She was all over, like, oy vey. 
[00:43:00]  Why this guy?  I bet he could make a nice pocket pee, though.  I'm telling you.  Out of balloons.  Imagine that.  Like, it would probably look just like a pee.  Yeah.  Ah, hoo-ha.  And then, you know, lube it up.  Twist that thing up.  You know our show.  We will get the guy in here, and he will make balloon animals for us.  Absolutely.  Come on.  The basketball court was the best, with the little balloon that went into the basket.  Into the black guy.  That was great.  Yeah.  Well, who else was he going to give it to?  And the girl, he gave her a superhero costume. 
[00:43:30]  I thought that was good.  That was messed up, the basketball hoop, I've got to admit.  Why?  I mean, you could even shoot hoops with another balloon that was tied to, like,  Yeah, that was tied to.  And it was weird.  It was tethered to the night.  Who thinks of this crap?  Yeah, that's what it is.  How long has this guy had to think about it and practice this stuff to be able to do this?  Well, look at him.  What else does he have to do?  Exactly.  No life.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Matt. 
[00:44:00]  Matt, what's going on?  Yo.  Oh, hey.  What's happening, bro?  Hey.  I know this balloon guy.  He is a nutbag, all right?  You know him?  I know him.  I'm from Jersey.  I used to hang out at this cafe in Madison, New Jersey, that he did.  Uh-huh.  And the kid is nuts.  He'll talk about anything.  He's absolutely out of his mind.  He used to follow me.  He's a big music fan.  Yeah.  And I went to a blues travel on New Year's Eve once, and he said he was going to be there.  So I get there, and I don't see this guy.  So I'm like, oh, thank God. 
[00:44:30]  Next thing I know, I see all these people with balloon hats.  I'm like, oh, no, he's here.  He's following me.  So, yeah, the guy is out of his mind, and he's sitting with us.  And me and my friend are trying to get rid of him the whole damn concert, and this guy  is staying with us.  Now, do you got his phone numbers or contact?  Well, no, I could probably get in touch with him.  I don't know.  Maybe he's still hanging out at the cafe or whatever.  I'll try to get in touch with him.  But anyways, at the blues travel concert, at the end of the show, John Popper throws out  harmonicas. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  I knocked him out of the way and grabbed my two harmonicas, and ever since, he would  always try to, oh, what about my harmonica, man?  What about my harmonica?  I told him to go screw himself.  All right, we'll get him on the show.  All right, man.  I'm sure we will.  Hold on one sec.  Hold on.  That's the saddest part.  I'm sure we will.  Jeff from Poor Washington makes a good point.  Note to Opie, what effing good is having the guy make balloon animals on the radio?  Yeah.  That's true.  It's like having a puppet on the radio.  Once again, it's not the visual.  Well, it's the reaction as he's making these stupid animals. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  For us.  Don't worry about it.  You'll enjoy it.  We have to get him first, please.  The coveted guess that that would be.  That's the line of guess we get.  Well, one of them is standing by.  Oh, really?  Right.  The Russian mob guy, is he here?  From the Sopranos?  The one that beat up Tony's sister with the fig leg?  Oh.  Another false alarm stink?  He was here, and I went upstairs to get him, and he wasn't there.  He said, screw this, right?  Interesting.  Maybe he heard us talking about him. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  But, uh, yes, it's the ONA show.  Let's go to the FU line.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  Stinky rocks.  And you're listening to the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big f*** you to the Port Authority for raising the goddamn f***ing tolls,  and for f***ing Governor Whitman for passing the f***ing laws before she jetted to Washington.  F*** you and your f***ing helicopter-driving politicians.  F*** yourself.  Next message.  I want to leave a big FU to all the Green Line passengers who ride the buses in Queens 
[00:46:30]  who never have their Metro cards ready when they get on the bus.  F*** you, stinky bastard.  You smell you never take showers.  F*** you.  Next message.  Hello.  This FU is directed to a Mr. Joe P***er of f***ing pest control.  I hope a rat comes out of a toilet and bites your junk off.  Have a nice weekend.  End of message. 
[00:47:00]  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Colty and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, you mentioned Jervis from The First Survivor.  Yeah.  This just in.  Jervis Peterson, a participant of the first edition of Survivor, is recovering after a  scuffle Thursday morning with a limousine driver.  He got in a fight?  And I know someone associated with this has to be a fan of the show. 
[00:47:30]  Peterson was being driven to tape an episode of As the World Turns in New York City.  Uh-huh.  When he became involved in a disagreement with his chauffeur, the driver then allegedly  assaulted Peterson.  Ah.  No charges have been filed and Peterson's injuries reportedly did not require hospitalization.  You know, popped in the head.  Popped in the head.  Oh, he just popped him in the head and shut the F up.  Nice.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Yeah, here it is.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  You know it's the name of the herb.  It's called Horny Goatweed.

[00:49:00]  Doing the worst of on the weekends.  We got two parts of the Dice segment ready to go and replay tomorrow.  The Lenny Clark call-in.  Good for you.  Talking about the job, the show he's in with Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar.  He was very funny.  The Feces Buffet, bitch.  Yeah.  We'll be on tomorrow during the worst of, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  My underwater fight club.  Nice.  And Reverend Al buying slaves. 
[00:49:30]  Al Mastad, tomorrow.  He's still over there, right?  Yeah.  Purchasing his slaves.  Oh, autograph.  Turn up the radio.  We've got to get Eddie Trunk in here.  Like, Eddie Trunk, like, Eddie Trunk poked his head in.  He was hanging out with us yesterday to check out Dice.  So he poked his head in to say, hey, and then we look up on the TV and on VH1, there's Eddie Trunk.  But if he's on TV, how could... 
[00:50:00]  But Major Nelson, I...  And the truth had done it to me again.  It's scary seeing your big fat head on the TV screen.  Wow.  It's something I don't publicize too much when it happens, because it's like...  Eddie, they really put the makeup on, too.  Jesus Christ.  I need all the help I can get, Ant.  No, I mean, you know, you look good natural, just like up there on the TV.  It looks like they did, like, some kind of Ed Wood makeup or something. 
[00:50:30]  It looks like they had a hair girl for you, too.  They're brushing out your hair and stuff, right?  They got somebody that, when you go in there, they put you in a chair, and they...  Actually, I taped that over two different days, so there was, like, a big continuity issue,  because they wanted to make sure that all the hair and makeup...  Like, what are you going to do with me?  Come on.  It's just like, put me out there.  How good am I going to look, you know?  You're a Jersey guy.  Yeah, I know the music.  That's why I'm there.  I'm not there, because I look like Cain, you know?  So, what did they...  You were critiquing or commenting on 80s bands? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, they called me.  There's a lot of people over at VH1 that are fans of the Saturday show, and they called me  up, because they were doing this 80s hair band special, and this actually is a repeat  airing.  This aired for the first time about two weeks ago, and they did four hours worth of taping,  and it's a four-hour show, and they're just replaying it, and they just count down.  It's later on in the show, it gets into the more mainstream bands, but right now, in the  early part, you're seeing, like, the autographs from the Night Rangers.  Kicks.  Kicks.  Kicks. 
[00:51:30]  They're on here.  Faster pussycat.  You know what?  This is such a crap.  You realize that this is...  I mean, everything started sounding the same.  Well, that's the thing.  Not only did everything start to sound the same, but you realize that most of these bands  only had one song, or two songs, and maybe one album or two albums, and they were gone  as quickly as they showed up.  Yeah, and that's the thing.  No, the power ballad was the thing that extended their careers, when they realized they couldn't  rock anymore.  It's like, well, we could get a power ballad out and get a little more fame out there. 
[00:52:00]  Right, every one of these bands had the power ballad.  Yeah, you're a pro.  Who was the first of the real power ballad band?  Who put out the first one?  I was thinking maybe, because the first one that really took off was Home Sweet Home.  Yeah, but Sister Christian was before that.  Oh, Sister Christian.  Yeah.  Motorized.  Every time I hear Sister Christian, I think of Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  You know, this great scene of Boogie Nights with Sister Christian. 
[00:52:30]  Probably Sister Christian, but it's funny, because when you look at these bands, and  that's the case early on in this countdown, but later on in the show, you start getting  into the, you know, the Bon Jovis and the Poisons and the bigger bands.  But when you look at these bands now...  I hate when people say that.  There's only...  The bigger bands?  No, the John Bo...  Oh, the Bon Jovis.  Oh, I hate...  I'm nothing against you.  A lot of people do that, like, you know?  The Dirk Cheaters.  They do it with everything.  There's only one Dirk Cheater.  There's only one band.  Yabba, dabba, do.  Yabba, dabba, do.  The Fred Flintstones. 
[00:53:00]  Yabba, dabba, do.  But, oh, isn't that a wheeze thing?  Huh?  That's a wheeze thing, too, right?  Everyone does it.  I'm just pointing out...  I hate when people do that, because, you know?  Anyway, it was fun to do.  Cool.  And there's some cool bands that come on later on in the show, but that's the thing that  knocked me out.  When you sit there and you look at this, it's like, there really was only one song, or two  songs, or maybe one record.  Thank God.  And then after that, there's like the four or five records that just continually sold  less.  Yeah, but Eddie, like, it's different today?  No. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  No.  It's still not at all.  That's still the deal.  Yeah.  Even less so.  I mean, now they barely get a song out.  Yeah, it's true.  And they're gone.  And they all have to look the same.  They all had to look the same.  Well, that's what kills the genre.  I mean, there's always one band that pops, and they're so different.  Everyone's into them.  And then other bands start kind of copying that style and that sound.  And then it gets watered down to the point, like we were just doing, we're looking, listening  to one of the songs you guys were playing on VH1, and we couldn't figure out if it was  faster.  Pussycat Kicks, Cinderella, all of a sudden it just gets all mixed together, and then 
[00:54:00]  boom, the genre just goes away.  And a lot of it's to blame for the record business, too, because they're the ones that  have no vision and sign all those cookie cutter ripoff bands.  It's the same thing.  Happened with the hair bands.  Happened with grunge rock.  Started to happen with the rock, metal, rap thing.  Pop stuff, now they're saying the same thing.  Yeah, the boy bands.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So.  But there's only one Britney Spears.  You can try to copy that.  Yeah.  So how was meeting Dice yesterday? 
[00:54:30]  That was big for me.  Now, Eddie Trunk is a huge Dice fan, so he comes in, he comes in, and he says to Dice,  he's sitting down, Dice, I'm a huge fan, have been for years, I just love your work.  Dice looks at him and goes, yeah, good for you.  And just turns away from him.  The cynical one.  Did you expect anything?  That's exactly what I said to Ed, because Ed kind of prepped me.  You know, he didn't say what you said he was going to say to me, Ed.  I know.  How do you take it, or whatever it was.  And I was waiting for that, and I was like, cool.  And Ed fed me the response in advance. 
[00:55:00]  And then.  He threw me the curveball, and then Anthony goes, Dice, he's a big fan.  And I said to Ed, I go, I'm a big fan.  I would expect that response.  If he didn't do anything else, it would have been like.  Yeah, and then he goes, well, what, do you want me to invite him out for dinner?  What do you want?  And then Eddie goes to leave.  He goes, where you going?  Yeah.  He goes, no, no, you're with me, Doc.  You sit down.  You're a friggin' psychopath.  Backing up, someone on the instant feedback said Journey came up with the first power ballot.  But yeah, but they weren't one of the metal bands. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, you know.  We're talking the hair bands.  We're talking the hair bands.  Maybe Night Ranger might be it.  I don't know if I can think of anything earlier than Night Ranger, actually, off the top of my head.  But my friend, some of the guys that own Lemores in Brooklyn called me just now.  They just told me it was being replayed, and they said, watching this is like the history of Lemores.  Because you guys, you know, Lemores is like, this is where all those bands broke out of.  So it's really a trip.  It's a lot of memories, actually, is what it's all about.  Some bad.  Many bad. 
[00:56:00]  And then you get the people, like when this first aired, people were calling me on Saturday night and going,  how the heck was this band not in there?  And I was like, who cares?  The whole point of this is to get people to talk about how bad or how good it was.  It's just about to get the attention.  It's not like a validated list.  Right, right.  It's not like the Oscars or something.  Anytime you put a list out, people are like, here's your list, this guy off.  Who's on now, Opie?  Kix.  Kix again?  Again, power ballad.  I thought it was Spinal Tap.  That looks like David St. Hubbins. 
[00:56:30]  And all the interviews.  That was also cool.  Watching the old 80s interviews from MTV where they all sit down and have to be too cool for the room.  They just showed the guy from Kix.  I remember this.  It was one of the behind the musics or one of those where now he used to be in Kix and now he does billboards for a living.  He paints them.  I work in a haberdasher.  There's a lot of those guys that what they're doing.  Some of the guys, what they're trying to do now, every band on this countdown is back together in some way, shape, or form.  Because they're all going around for another money run and some of them are doing well. 
[00:57:00]  But they're doing it off of this stuff because for people that are like 30 years old, this is their classic rock.  Right.  So they're all making some money again and they're all reforming and going out and playing these clubs.  You know, I have you twerking now, but we all remember the Warren story.  Remember that?  The guy does a big drum solo.  He stands up.  This is a few years back.  I mean, the scene was just dead.  The hair band's gone.  And now it's almost making a resurgence in one way or another. 
[00:57:30]  But this was when it was just no one wanted to even hear from him anymore.  So the drummer does a solo.  He stands up, throws his sticks out, and you hear clink, clink, clink, clink, on the floor.  The empty floor.  You just hear clink, clink, clink, clink.  He threw it right past the crowd.  They're all like close to the stage.  Clink, clink, clink, clink.  Can you throw that back?  I can't afford it.  You do stay.  I still love that party you used to have.  You used to say, let's party, you know, with Jack Daniels.  It's iced tea.  Yeah.  Snapple.  They'd stand there with the, because they can't drink the booze anymore. 
[00:58:00]  And then who was that?  Skid Row was talking about when they were out.  I mean, there would be booze bottles on every flat surface of every hotel room,  and they're drinking and drinking.  And then they'd just leave it there, you know, full bottles, half bottles.  And then they knew that the gravy train was running out when the road manager would come in  and start capping the bottles and bringing them with them, the booze bottles, for the next hotel.  And they're like, uh-oh, something's up.  Something's up.  And there was that one story I heard that somebody stage dove,  and there weren't enough people in the crowd to catch them. 
[00:58:30]  I heard that one, too.  And the guy got all banged up, because they all moved.  Yeah, they're not holding you, man.  And now you're fat.  Exactly.  I don't want to see these bands go on tour anymore.  They're all out there.  No, because I don't want to see the same girls that looked hot in the 80s  kind of squeeze into that spandex.  What about the guys?  You look like the full Monty up there playing, you know?  Oh, the girls, though.  Yeah, they wear the spandex. 
[00:59:00]  They pull it out of the closet.  It don't look like it did when you were 18, 19, 20.  Believe me.  I'm telling you, you're right on,  because I deal with a lot of the people in the clubs around the tri-state area,  and they book these bands, and they tell me the same thing.  They see people they haven't seen in, like, 10, 15 years,  and they're coming in, and they're wearing the same clothes they wore 15 years ago,  but it ain't working anymore, you know?  It ain't working. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, Rick, please tell me those incredibly hot women outside the studio will be naked.  Oh, they are our topless bartenders.  Now, I'm getting a little nervous.  Will they be topless, though?  Oh, yeah.  After all, it is the O&A show, where nothing ever pans out.  Dude, not only when I set this up that I asked them,  I called them on Monday and asked them to make sure.  I called them yesterday and asked them.  When she walked in, the first thing I said,  let me have that box, these girls are going to be topless, right?  They're like, yes.  I'm like, that's all I need.  Saigon kick.  Good.  Saigon kick. 
[01:00:00]  You know, a lot of people are saying Beth from Kiss was the first power ballad,  but they're not really a hair band.  No, and you know what's funny?  Not to ruin it for anybody who's actually watching this right now,  but Kiss is in this countdown.  They're the only 70s band that's in this countdown,  and my point about that was every band in the 70s,  when they had a career in the 80s,  they all altered their look to look like the other bands.  Even Ozzy, if you look at the video for Shot in the Dark,  he's got that big hair and the eyeliner and that sequin robe. 
[01:00:30]  All the 70s bands, that was the worst thing,  is the 70s bands trying to look like the 80s bands who were young at the time.  But, you know, it was also bad,  the 80s bands trying to look grunge in 90s bands.  Right.  Hey, I need to know something.  Is Lita Ford finally coming back?  Oh, no.  Remember that behind the music?  Lita Ford, I miss my rock and roll, and I'll be back.  No, no, stay there.  Stay around that baby.  Stay on the beach with your body wrapped around that blanket.  Grab a 90s band, lady. 
[01:01:00]  I think a lot of these people are just looking to make a last catch.  Hey, Eddie, look at it.  I'm looking at you.  I'm looking at you on the TV.  Scary both ways, though.  Kind of bizarre.  Look at that, a famous person in the studio.  I know, he's on TV.  Hey, you're the most famous person we had on the show this week.  Look at that.  Hey, come on, huh?  Eddie Trunk.  Oh, man.  Catch him on Saturday night, Rocks.  Thank you, guys.  You're welcome.  Appreciate it.  Oh, are you going to go see Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry? 
[01:01:30]  I saw Monster Magnet Wednesday night here in the city.  They rocked.  It was great.  I may go, the Jersey show's a little closer for me,  so I might go to the Jersey show on Sunday.  But Buck Cherry didn't play with them on Wednesday here in the city.  It was just Monster Magnet, but they were really, really good.  Right on.  I heard Ben do his Buck Cherry Monster Magnet 2 for yesterday.  Oh, we're always thinking.  Oh, Chris from Manhattan, man.  You know something?  And I understand this whole thing.  You go on TV, and you're just going to get railed. 
[01:02:00]  Because when the XFL thing happened, that's all we heard.  I'm watching VH1.  I had no idea they let Mark David Chapman out on furlough to hope he's done.  Oh, my God.  Holy ass.  That's bad.  There you go.  Mark David Chapman.  No, we're going to be seeing Buck Cherry and Monster Magnet Monday at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  We were supposed to have the bands on the show, but...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Someone threw a curveball at us.  Someone's been playing politics. 
[01:02:30]  Someone's a little scared of us.  Mm-hmm.  If they're on that show, you'll never hear your song on this station again.  And we work for the same company.  That old gag.  Thank you for the support, you ass munch.  That old gag.  Don't worry.  We will bury you.  How many gold records have you smashed against the wall because of kicking your ass, dick?  All right.  Ouch.  Yeah, we're talking about Billy Barty. 
[01:03:00]  Grab those gold records off your little Vienna sausage fingers and slap them against the wall in anger.  It's always fun to see a guy that's pushing 55, dressing in Abercrombie clothes, trying to look cool.  Oh, really?  You really fit in when Kid Rock and everyone else is hanging out at the studio and they're hanging out with the hip DJs and you're in the picture, too. 
[01:03:30]  No, you're putting right in.  Yeah, sure.  That's good.  Hey, Kid Rock brought his dad.  Who's the narc?  Yeah, who's the narc in the picture?  And you're not fooling anyone.  You do have a wooden box somewhere to make yourself look taller.  Or...  With taking pictures, let me get my stepstool.  I thought Josie died.  What a douchebag.  How paranoid are you? 
[01:04:00]  You can't let a band on our show.  Always throwing it.  Oh, wow.  Look at the instant feedback.  What?  That person writing in saying, okay, uncle.  I got the station right, the name right, and everything.  Very funny.  Oops.  I'm pissed.  I wanted to talk to Buck Cherry.  Monster Magnet.  You don't even know. 
[01:04:30]  They were motivated.  They wanted to play.  We had it all set up and then someone got involved.  They're not to appear on that program.  F and whore.  That's what happens, though.  That's what happens in these circumstances.  They pull what's called power plays.  Well, that's going to have to change as we renegotiate around here.  Hmm.  T minus.  Ooh, not much time left.  I believe that'll be coming up with the big guy very soon. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you got a picture.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Look at the show.  Oh, that fits right in.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  That's good.  Could you stay out of the picture?  Nice sweater.  Just stay out of the pictures, at least.  You got a free bowl of soup with that sweater?  Hey.  What's good on you, though?  Why do you have to be in every picture?  What's it to you that you're in every picture? 
[01:05:30]  Sneaky F, I swear to God.  Yeah.  It's the games they play.  We're used to it.  That's why you never hear name bands on this show.  That's why we don't get the big names.  It was hard enough to get an Aerosmith calling.  I'm not sure they were punished for that.  Trust me.  They were punished for that. 
[01:06:00]  I guarantee it.  Oh, Jeremy's walking around outside all nervous.  Oh, is he?  Oh, boy.  Doesn't he have more of the boss's luggage to carry out of the building?  I'm walking in the building this afternoon.  All I see is Ken Stevens leaving.  He's going to Washington.  Obviously, any W is fixed, so he doesn't have to be here anymore.  It's perfect.  Perfect in every way.  And there's...  No, I think...  Well...  What?  And there's Jeremy with his bag. 
[01:06:30]  Red cap.  Red cap.  That's like mobile law.  You know why Ken left the building today, right?  To go out with Melissa.  He got a phone call from someone very important.  Oh, he did?  That's part of this negotiation.  Oh!  And I think it floored him, and he needed to leave immediately.  He's leaving the country, then, is he?  He didn't leave the building.  He fled the building.  He looked like Dr. Bellows. 
[01:07:00]  Well, I've never...  The numbers...  I can't even count.  It's unbelievable.  But you were just...  But you were here for three years, Mick.  And now you want...  But I thought we'd continue to underpay them for another three years.  Where'd you get a number that I can't...  Can Jeannie snap up some cash?  I need to lay down. 
[01:07:30]  Jeremy, get my bag.  Bellboy.  Bellboy.  You should have made him dress in bellboy clothes.  Paging Mr. Herman.  Paging Mr. Herman.  You have a telephone call at the front desk.  So, no Buck Cherry or Monster Magnet.  I'll get you a bag, Gary.  Remember Roger?  Pop-Tot Roger used to carry Gary's bags out to his car.  I'll get those, Gary.  We'll talk on the way to the garage about me keeping my job. 
[01:08:00]  This place sucks.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Very good.  Joey.  Joey, what's up, man?  What's up, Joey?  Yo.  Joey.  Speak.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, when are you guys going to do a Soprano thing?  What do you mean a Soprano thing?  I thought you guys were going to do a look-alike Soprano contest. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, that's stupid.  Why would we do that?  That's a really...  I called two weeks ago.  They said, yeah, call back.  Who said...  Hey there.  That's a wacky radio bit for somebody.  Is it?  Do a Sopranos look-alike contest.  Is that what you're trying to do, dude?  That's what I'm trying to do, dude.  Who do you look like, Joey?  I look like Tony Soprano.  Oh, yeah?  That's great.  Can you say it soon?  I do a good joke.  Pesci, too.  Oh, yeah?  Let's hear it.  Hey, Henry.  How many times are you going to tell you, Henry? 
[01:09:00]  I do favors for you with this shoe board.  You know what I'm saying here?  That's not bad.  That's good.  It sounds like a Gorilla Boy impression of Pesci.  All right.  All right, Jerry.  Hey, wait a minute.  Let me hear that again.  Henry, how many times...  Oh, my God, dude.  Come on.  You've got to do it ten times?  All right.  We heard it.  That old gang.  So, as we go to break here, you can thank the Abercrombie and Fitch midget for preventing

[01:11:00]  O.B. and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister, feel up your sister, feel up your sister.  O.B. and Anthony.  You guys are awesome.  I got a list.  You check a drug.  1-0-7-0-2-0-1-0.  Look at the end.  Your balls are healing.  And they're big.  Look at the end.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  It's always a cowbell bill. 
[01:11:30]  Foot.  Foot.  Hey.  Foot.  The foot is in town.  Dear damn.  We're hanging because, um, that was a, it's going to be a bar.  He brought the bar.  Hell.  What the hell?  The boss is gone.  No, when you only have a month and a half left on your contract, we have found out you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want.  You can do anything.  Great party.  You know if they walk around on eggshells around us lately? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, it's hysterical.  No, they don't say anything about the show.  Mm-mm.  Nothing.  Kind of like that little kid from the Twilight Zone.  They don't want to piss us off.  Now, now, Anthony, you get a seat right next to Anthony.  Send him to the cornfield.  We loved dinner, Anthony.  It was wonderful last night.  It's okay that I cursed a hundred times in your show yesterday.  It's okay.  It's good.  And we might be fine by the FCC.  See, you guys are doing good.  You're doing good. 
[01:12:30]  Would you like some more free sushi?  You want to watch TV, Anthony?  Here's some alcohol.  I notice you guys don't prep for your show anymore.  That's good, though.  It seems to be working.  It's good.  It is good.  It's good, Anthony.  That was one of the best.  What was the kid?  Billy Mummy?  What else?  Yeah.  What else can we get away with, man?  We got the...  We got naked bartenders coming into the studio.  We're trashing the other station.  How about we key up a few CDs? 
[01:13:00]  See him up.  See him up real good.  Stan from California.  What's going on?  How you doing, man?  Stan from California.  This is you guys.  Been out here about 10 days, and the radio out here is just terrible.  Come on!  Are you listening to us today?  I am on hold.  That's the only way I can listen to you guys out here.  Why'd you move to Cali?  Going back to Cali.  Why did I move or when?  Why?  Why?  New job.  New job.  What part of California?  I'm in Northern California.  I'm in the Monterey area. 
[01:13:30]  Monterey.  Not even the warm California.  I think they had a fun little one.  Yeah, I know.  It's kind of about 55 and cloudy, but there's good golf down here, so...  That's all I know about Monterey.  Hey, they had a great festival.  All right.  If you're in California, you better be in Southern California at least.  At least it's nice.  You can get down there to check out the babes down there.  Yeah?  All right.  You're up by the wood chicks, the friggin' logging chicks, and...  Oh, I know.  The tree huggers and spotted owls and...  You know, next time you're out of tape, wipe, spotted owl, huh?  All right. 
[01:14:00]  Nothing better than logging chicks.  In case you're wondering what happened in Monterey, the Beatles couldn't make it,  so Paul McCartney shipped over all this camera equipment with liquid LSD in the lenses.  Really?  That's what happened in Monterey.  Why did I miss that?  I don't know.  Hey, you know, you said logging trucks.  Yeah.  You ever hear that Brian Regan bit about logging trucks?  No.  You know, in your neck of the woods, Stan.  You'll be on the highway and you'll see a log truck going this way and then another 
[01:14:30]  one going the other way.  And like Brian Regan says, why don't those two just make a phone call?  Yeah.  Yeah, you see two logging trucks pass each other on the highway.  You're like, where's that guy going?  Wait, if I'm bringing logs that way and he's coming from that way and bringing them this  way...  Just a thought.  Why didn't they make a phone call?  Right.  All right, Stan.  You want to be on hold for a while?  Sure.  Why not?  Hey, have you guys ever driven from New York to California?  Many times.  Oh, have you driven across Kansas before? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I was hoping Dorothy'd come down on her bike so I could knock her off and bang her  in a wheat field.  It was so boring.  Actually, me, Plankfoot over here, Joe Curry, and a friend of ours went in a Camaro.  A Camaro Z28.  We drove from New York to L.A.  How long did it take?  It took us a day and a half.  Yeah.  We were hallucinating by the time we hit Albuquerque to where no one knew.  We couldn't appoint a driver that was conscious or within the realm of thought. 
[01:15:30]  Nothing.  I said, okay, I'll drive.  So I get out there.  It's pitch black.  The middle of the desert.  There's no street lights.  It's just that you're headlights.  So all of a sudden, these guys wake up to me sideways, screeching on the brake.  Oh!  I saw it.  You know how they paint lines in the road so the aerial helicopters can time your speed?  I swear to you, it was a railroad tie.  It was like a big piece of railroad tie that was in the middle of the road.  I thought so.  It was just a piece of white paint.  But I hadn't seen anything in so long. 
[01:16:00]  I was in the zone.  Tunnel vision.  White line fever.  That was it.  No matter what I saw on the road was an obstacle.  And then I told them what it was.  And they're like, dude, you are effed up, man.  Get in the back and I'll drive.  And then I told Joe, I said, that isn't even the worst thing.  I swear to you, I was seeing bunny rabbits jumping across the road.  Like, not jackrabbits like you would see.  Little bunny rabbits.  I couldn't see.  And then I told him, go back, go get to sleep.  So I'm driving and the railroad tie comes out. 
[01:16:30]  Again, he does the same thing.  Holy moly, I thought you were effed up.  But no, it screwed you up.  How about when we were in Albuquerque and there were three ex-cons that got loose?  Yeah.  We happened to look just like.  No way.  Dude, true story.  We were in Denny's and the waitresses are looking at us and getting on the phone and stuff.  Yeah.  And then we high-tailed it out of there.  They get booked.  We heard the report coming over the radio behind the counter.  Three males.  And they gave a description.  We're looking at each other like, oh my God, it's on. 
[01:17:00]  And we're all ragged, man.  We've been driving nonstop.  We're tired.  We're just, we're a mess.  And everyone starts looking at us.  Like, okay.  What's up?  Let's get out of here.  I was going to ask you how many beers it took you on that trip, but I think you were way  beyond beer there.  Yeah.  We didn't need beer.  We had hallucin, we were just hallucinating from lack of sleep.  Lack of sleep is a great thing.  All right, Stan.  That'll do it.  Thank you, Stan.  All right, appreciate you guys.  Let me listen for a while.  Take care.  All right, we'll put you on hold and you hang up when you want, okay? 
[01:17:30]  Thanks.  I think he's calling from a car phone.  He's going to listen to him.  Get a huge bill.  Nice.  He better be funny for the next five minutes.  Make it worth his while.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on?  Turn on the radio.  Ah, Mike.  I want to tell you, I saw your friend Dice on the highway yesterday.  Him and his wife were like a little bitch.  I had to go after them and they took off like two little pansies.  You're saying Dice was driving?  No, he had somebody driving.  He was in a car with somebody.  Yeah, Dice doesn't drive.  Yeah.  They were like two little pansies and they took off like two little girls like the fag that 
[01:18:00]  he is.  What, you wanted to chase him down?  I wanted to grab him and bitch smack him a little bit because he thought he was such  a big shot.  Wait, so you saw Dice on the highway.  Someone else was driving him.  Listen.  That's all I need to say anymore.  Hey, Mike, we had to dump out of you.  You can't say the S word or else...  Excuse me.  I said what I had to say.  You know what I said.  I don't have to repeat that.  You're a real tough guy, aren't you, Mike?  I'm not a tough guy.  You sound like a tough guy. 
[01:18:30]  Why are you so angry?  I'm not a tough guy.  No, he's a tough guy.  He's the one that jumped in the car and took off like a little pansy.  You know, you come across sounding like a miserable bastard.  Really?  You're a real bitch, isn't it?  That won't make it through either.  Mike, Mike.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  Let me tell you something.  I wish I had to time to waste more time, but you're going to, unfortunately, I'm a little  more busy than you.  No, I'll play.  Have a nice day, Mike.  Mike, I'll play with you.  I'll play with you.  Yeah, he hangs up.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  He hangs up.  He's listening.  Ah, Poole said, I got a little more busy than you, guys.  I'm a moron.  Fries are up.  I got to go.  Which way did he go?  I'm busier than you, guys.  Because I've seen dice.  All right, Doc.  You sound like one of those moron guys in the car, dude.  I'll play with you, Doc.  Fine. 
[01:19:30]  Okay, Mr. Rabbit.  Hey, it's almost quitting time.  Five o'clock.  We're the naked bartenders.  Yeah.  We should have played the whistle, and then everybody's working for the weekend, Opie.  The weekend can't start without everybody's working for the weekend.  And bang on your drum all day.  A little trivia for you.  They used the whistle from Allentown by Billy Joel.  Yeah.  Is that it?  I thought it was the Flintstones.  Yeah, I thought it was the Flintstones whistle.  Depends on what station.  I'm going to mix it up. 
[01:20:00]  So I'm going to use the Allentown.  I'm going to mix it up a little.  My own personal mix.  See, where most people use the Flintstones whistle.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  That's right, everybody.  My horse drum.  Oh, we're all working for the weekend.  Jesus.  How many times has this been done?  Break out the rum. 
[01:20:30]  Really?  We're all working for the weekend.  Yeah.  Oh, gee.  But it's good, Friday.  We're working for Resurrection.  Come on, everybody.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Oh, wow.  Everybody wants a new love, man. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, that's it.  What the hell were you thinking?  By the way, it's okay to eat meat today.  Look at crazy.  Anyway. 
[01:21:30]  Anyway.  Are you ready?  Sweet, merciful crap.  Well, it's the weekend now.  Mike, what's going on? 
[01:22:00]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, how long has that Wacky Mornings radio show been around?  What, 20 years?  Which one?  About the Z100.  Z100.  Or 95.5.  You think they could come up with a worse song than that God-blessed banger drum song?  Yeah, that's another one.  They do the same thing.  They've done it for the last 20 years, and it still sucks.  Yeah, but Mike, I don't want to work.  I just want to bang on the drum all day.  I just want to bang on the head of the person that made the song.  What the hell does that mean?  Is there a hidden meaning? 
[01:22:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Happy Friday.  Moose Moran with you.  It's going to kick off the weekend.  And we're going to bang on the drum here on the Moose.  Oh, I get to talk more.  Damn, I thought I hit the post.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bang on your drum all day.  That's what you see this one.  Oh! 
[01:23:00]  Spring on the coke horse.  Turn it off.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Topless.  Yep.  It's that.  It's topless bartender time.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, finally.  This is what you do when you only have a month and a half left.  Yeah.  They were upset that we had a little bartender.  Oh, good God.  Here and there.  Hey, ladies.  Good morning.  Ladies.  I like girls.  Hi.  How are you guys?  Who's who?  Vanessa.  Hi, Vanessa.  Hi.  You guys are beautiful.  Cardi girls, guys.  Cardi girls.  Very nice.  We'll promote whatever you want. 
[01:23:30]  I love the booze girls.  Wait, who's who?  You guys.  Huh?  Anthony.  That's Opie.  This is Cowbell Bill.  That's Foote.  How are you doing?  There's Rick.  And here's Ben.  Nice to meet you.  You've met everybody.  There's VH1 star Eddie Trunk.  Eddie Trunk.  You mean we're not still talking about that?  I just...  Yeah, yeah.  It's fine.  Don't you have a Saturday night show to get together?  And what are your names?  Vanessa. 
[01:24:00]  Vanessa.  And Angeline?  We're cousins.  You're cousins?  Are you kissing cousins?  Yeah.  Donut bumping cousins?  Is it right to business?  And you are topless barmaids or bartenders?  No, no, no, no.  What?  We just work for promoting Bacardi.  Oh, wow.  Topless Bacardi bartender, babe.  What?  Oh, okay.  Exactly.  When you said no, we all...  We're getting nervous.  Our hearts all stopped.  I know.  I saw the DEF CON sign change for a second there.  We flatlined for a second. 
[01:24:30]  I saw it.  Hey, good DEF CON one.  What are we doing?  Well, we want...  Do we want a drink?  No.  Do you need a drink?  Well, yeah.  I always use a drink.  Now, do you have a blender over there?  We don't need one.  Why?  You don't need a blender?  No.  You shake them.  So, um...  Shake it.  When's the topless part?  What do you got?  Wow, they got little black, um, uh...  Little shorts on.  Hot pants.  Hot pants.  They're called hot pants.  Hot pants.  Hot pants. 
[01:25:00]  That's good.  And they got their little shirts tied up.  Exactly.  Showing their nice little bellies.  Is that a Bacardi bat?  Yeah.  Is that a new promotion?  I really don't know.  It's a symbol for the nightlife of Bacardi.  Oh, look at that.  On hot days, you can make your sack look like a bat wing.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's a hot day when it's hanging like a Turkish caffy.  And you can just pull it down.  It looks like a bat wings with two tumors.  So you guys are out of control.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  Just loosen it up before, uh... 
[01:25:30]  Wait till I start drinking.  I'll be ripping out the C-word.  It's transparent, too.  All right, let's, uh...  Nice.  Let's start the drink making.  See, the tie behind the neck is getting me nervous, though.  See, the shirt's come off, but then...  Bacardi bathing suit.  Oh, my God.  Bacardi bathing suit.  Hey.  It's nice.  The Bacardi bathing suit.  Yeah, I see.  It's thanks for my money.  That's nice.  That's your money maker.  Yes.  There you go.  You got two of them.  You got two nice money makers.  And a third when you turn around. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And then there's the whole bank right in front.  27, 36.  Yeah?  Damn.  I like the raspy voice.  Yeah, that's good.  You smoke?  Hey, what happened?  Everything.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get the gate.  27.  What happened to the, uh...  The...  The last night was a rough day.  Yeah, but the...  Okay, you're bartending.  That's good.  You're beautiful.  That's good.  Topless.  Whoa.  No.  What happened?  Huh?  Details.  Nice. 
[01:26:30]  We were promised topless bartenders.  Topless Bacardi bartender, babes.  Okay.  Well...  Well, yeah.  You know...  I don't want to...  Get your bibs on, okay?  I don't want to feel like it's a rape here.  You know, just ask.  She goes, get your bibs.  Yeah, get them.  That's good.  Nice, right?  Nice.  That's very nice.  Very nice.  She's got a little surprise.  Oh, yeah?  What is it?  What do you got?  In the front and the back.  Whoa!  She's got a couple of diamond little piercings. 
[01:27:00]  Wow!  Whoa!  Look at that cat work.  You got wings.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a little angel.  That's a huge angel tattoo in the back.  Angel wings, we should say.  Turn around and let's see.  Something kind of cancels out the angel factor when you tattoo that on you.  And the nipple rings, eh?  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  What a little noise.  Hello, gentlemen.  Very nice.  Very good.  Oh, and the applause aren't stopping.  Amazing. 
[01:27:30]  I love hard nipples.  I love them.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, you just stir the drink with those things.  Nice.  Can you make me a white Russian?  And look at that.  That's good.  Wow.  They're topless and they're bartending.  How did we figure this out, finally?  Yeah.  How did this work?  I think we just...  I get sales out of it.  Something never works when we do this.  This is a good day.  Yeah.  Never works, gentlemen.  All right.  Those tats are amazing. 
[01:28:00]  Well, let's see.  I think I'll have a Bacardi and Coke.  There you go.  Starting out easy.  Yeah.  I don't mind if I do either.  Bacardi and Coke's over there.  That's good.  Okay.  That's a awesome power.  You want to come back and go?  I'm Karen.  What's going on?  Hey, it's a little off the point at this point, but I can't hear that Working for the Weekend  song without thinking of Chris Farley dancing Chippendale's routine.  Remember that thing?  Yeah.  That was awesome.  I hate when the good ones die young.  What the hell were you thinking? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  What were you thinking, Chris, that night in Chicago?  Exactly.  I also wanted to mention that Amber from Survivor is going to be at the Met game tonight.  She is?  Really?  Yeah.  I just saw her on New York Live.  All right.  Cool.  I guess they're punishing us.  She was supposed to be on our show, but I guess that ain't going to happen.  Why?  I thought Debbie had a great time when she talked to us from CBS.  Yep.  After the post-interview.  I thought it went well.  All right, Karen.  Thank you.  Bye.  That's nice.  What are you guys doing, mate?  Huh?  What are you doing? 
[01:29:00]  Look at Bill making some...  Hey, what are you doing?  She had me first.  I'll take the drink and flap those around a little bit.  Bye, bye, bye.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break, but don't I get a twist of wine?  The Naked Bartenders are here from Bacardi.  That rocks.  Looking spectacular.  Very good.  Oh, here she comes with some wine.  There you go. 
[01:29:30]  Thank you.  Whatever you want, honey.  This is great.  Okay.  When exactly does Satan have to collect us for all of our contracts?  Get our souls?  When is that?  All right, we have to take a break.  Ted Demme calling in very shortly.  The director of the new movie, Below, with Johnny Depp.  Ah.  Oh, sorry.  A little distracted, oh, are you?

[01:32:00]  Looking very, very hot.  How do you guys like the drinks?  Huh?  The drinks.  Very good, very good, very good.  Nice.  They always taste better when made by a nude girl.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, we'll get back to you ladies in a minute, but there's a big-time director on the phone  line here.  Did you guys see the movie Blow?  I heard about it.  You heard about Blow?  Yeah.  You do the Blow?  You like the Blow?  Well, he's on the phone. 
[01:32:30]  Maybe he'll put me in his next movie.  Ah, well, the casting couch is right here.  You never know.  At AEW Studios.  You never know.  Mr. Demme.  Topless bartender.  Sorry, guys.  Yeah?  Are we on?  Are we on right now?  Yeah, we got to say hi to Ted Demme, the director of Blow.  I'm going to apologize right off the bat.  We're staring at beautiful girls, and they're serving us drinks today, Ted.  That's what I'm doing.  Oh, really?  Perfect.  Ours are topless over here. 
[01:33:00]  Mine are bottomless.  Ladies, come on.  Help us out.  Can't let Ted...  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on, Ted?  Everything's good.  How are you guys doing today?  Great.  I finally saw Blow last night.  Oh, what did you think?  I liked it.  I really did.  It's a very good movie, and man, Johnny Depp.  Wow.  Yeah, he's something, isn't he?  I'm trying to think what we want to talk to you about with this movie, but these girls are  really distracting.  Exactly.  I don't blame you.  Yeah, the movie, I mean, it's been an amazing ride for me. 
[01:33:30]  I've had the project for about six years, and I've gotten to know the real George really  well, as you might imagine.  He's in prison right now.  The last picture, I think it was after the credits, was that the real George Young?  Yep.  Oh, man.  And he's in prison.  Yeah, he's there for quite a bit.  Until the year 2014.  Yeah, 2014.  He'll get out when he's 71.  And who was saying, I think you or Johnny Depp said that he has done his time and he should  be released, right? 
[01:34:00]  Well, here's the thing.  The guy, you know, there's no doubting that he is a criminal, and there's no doubting that,  you know, he's been responsible for some pretty heavy-duty transportation of cocaine to our  country, you know, 85 percent of...  Yeah, you're downplaying it, aren't you?  He was basically the...  Yeah, he was the guy.  He was the American connection.  Yeah, he was.  If it wasn't for him, no one would have done coke in the 80s, basically.  Oh, yeah, sure.  That's right.  You can tell yourself that.  But, you know, it's just like, on a broader scale, it's like, you know, I talk a lot about, 
[01:34:30]  and I've gotten to know a lot about, you know, kind of drug penalties in our country,  and, you know, from Robert Downey Jr. to, you know, to George, to kids that are on the  corner in, you know, wherever, in any ghetto selling, you know, 12, you know, rocks of  a crack in their hand, they get 20 years automatic.  It's just a jail sentencing, you know, thing in our country, just all cockeyed, and I just  think it's got to be, there's no rhyme or reason to it, you know, and, like, these 20-year-old  kids can put away for 20 years, it's a joke, you know, it's like... 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, I think if you're smoking pot or something like that, and you get busted...  Yeah, I know.  I don't see the reason to have to go to jail.  I mean, these guys shouldn't be in jail with murderers.  My point was that these guys should be in rehab, you know what I mean, and the reason  I thought that George, I kind of made the same, I thought George should be out, because I  really do think he could do better on the outside.  I mean, he's got a great story.  He really wants to do somewhat of, like, a scared, straight thing for kids, and he's  paid his price, man.  He's a pretty lonely guy, and he's done a lot of times, so, you know, I think he could  do better on the outside than he can on the inside.  Ted, let's back up just a second, and you want to explain really, really quickly what the 
[01:35:30]  movie blows about so everyone can be involved with this?  Yeah, sure, absolutely.  It's based on a true story, and, you know, kind of on paper, the book that I read that  attracted me to the project called Blow, it's about a small-town kid back in the 50s, high  school All-American, missed the popularity, football player, moved out to Manhattan Beach  in 1968 to kind of be free of his parents, to try to figure out life, you know, as a 21-year-old  would, start selling dope, and gets involved in it, is good in it, gets swept up in the 
[01:36:00]  culture, gets busted, gets put in jail next to a Colombian guy who's best friends with  Escobar, and when he gets out of prison, he goes and meets Pablo and becomes Pablo's  right-hand man.  And he basically becomes responsible for, like we talked about before, trafficking in  about 85% of the cocaine to our country in the late 70s.  The real story for me is this man's journey, because he's not Tony Montana, he was a regular  kid who got caught up in power and greed in a warped version of the American dream, particularly 
[01:36:30]  in the 70s, in a time of great revolution in our country, and about the price that he's  paid.  He's lost a lot, and his family's estranged.  And the real, as you guys know if you saw last night, the real story for me is this love  story between he and his daughter, who is a real tough one to digest right now.  And he's been in jail for how many years now?  He's been in there, well, he's been in there on his last run for 9 or 10 years.  Yeah, and the daughter hasn't seen him yet, right?  Yeah, she's 21 years old herself right now, and, you know, trying to just, you know, move 
[01:37:00]  on with life as a normal 21-year-old.  And she helped me, she was involved in the movie, she was a consultant on the movie, but...  And, wait, wait, because I was going to ask you this, her name's Christina Young?  Yeah.  Was she the clerk in the back?  No, no, she was a...  That was just a coincidence?  No, no, no, no, what happened was, there was a scene in the film that I actually cut  out, the trial scene, but I just kept the name in the credits, so I thought she wanted  to see her name in the credits.  So she helped you with the movie, and even acted in the movie, and she still hasn't seen 
[01:37:30]  her father?  She hasn't seen his dad yet, because...  That's a little weird, huh?  Yeah, well, you know what, man, it's, she's, the last 20 minutes of the film is pretty accurate  about what she went through as a kid.  Yeah.  And she's talked to him, since I've made the movie, I've really encouraged them to  at least get on the phone, I just don't think she's ready to sit in front of her dad and  go, okay, we need to talk about this, do you know what I mean?  Yeah, okay.  So she's just going through, you know, think about it, you're 21 years old, and your dad  was like a huge, you know, drug runner, and like you said before, his historical, you  know, presence on our country is really, you know, heavy. 
[01:38:00]  And the things that she went through personally, that's a lot of stuff to put on anyone, particularly  a 21-year-old.  Right.  The last 20 minutes of the movie were just intense.  Yeah.  I mean...  Great job at that.  Oh, thanks.  I mean, I really thought I had a great opportunity.  I mean, the movie's called Blow, it's sexy, it's fun, there's great music in it, and I thought  that, because I knew what the end of the film was, this man in prison estranged from his  daughter and his wife, that I thought it gave me a license to really have fun with the first  hour, you know what I mean?  And so, I just wanted to show the 70s as what it was, it was a time in our country that was 
[01:38:30]  great, I'm jealous that I wasn't around, you know, rocking that time, it was like, there's  a revolution going on, sexually, and musically, and drug-wise, and it was just fun, and no  one knew what was going on, because they didn't have the warnings yet, but they all found out  when the 80s came around.  And Ray Liotta as the father?  Yeah, Ray Liotta, I mean...  Just kind of looking the other way, kind of knowing what his son was about the whole time,  and just, he didn't know what to really tell him.  Well, you know what happened, like, it was based, obviously, you know, based on stories that George  told me, I mean, this is a guy who, he loved his dad so much, and he didn't, he had a tough 
[01:39:00]  time with his mom, as you know, since you saw the movie, but his dad, like, never ever judged  him, didn't give him a thumbs up for what he was doing, but was just always a real dad,  a real good dad to him, and I thought of Ray Liotta for the part, because it wasn't kind  of Ray's stereotypical tough guy role, and I thought that he'd really rise to the occasion,  and I'm just so proud of his performance, I think Ray is just phenomenal in the film.  Yeah, because we thought Ray Liotta and that Silence of the Lambs sequel with the top of  his head off at the end of Upload.  That was so, that was so silly.  That was brutal, man. 
[01:39:30]  That was brutal.  It's like, yeah, that book was a lot to carry on, I thought the film was.  Yeah, well, I think we could all agree with that.  So whose idea was it to put Paul Reubens in?  It's funny, it was me, it just, it happened, you know, once I got Johnny Depp in the film,  you know, New Line kind of gave me the okay to cast whoever I wanted, which is great,  and I usually like, you know, working on big ensemble films and putting fun people in  fun roles, and I was actually showing Pee Wee's Playhouse to my daughter, and that was  four years old, and kind of, you know, seeing if she would dig it, and we just started laughing, 
[01:40:00]  and I sort of watched, and I'm like, man, I wonder where that guy is, I haven't seen  him forever, and I just tracked him down and said, hey, I got this part that I'd love to  talk to you about, and we met, and we just totally connected, and Paul's just such an  amazing guy, and really, really talented, obviously, and I was just, I've lucked out having  him in the movie.  You know, he was great in the movie, I mean, great, you just revitalized his career.  I know, man, he's so good.  He's going to be in a million movies now as a character actor.  I know, he's got, you know, he's just got such, you know, it's, what happened to him  was just a joke, you know, when you look at, like, what our president did over the last 
[01:40:30]  year, you know, how he got crucified, and it's just, it's just great.  Yeah, so you pranked him out in a movie theater, and his career fell apart.  It's because he was doing a kid's show.  Yeah, no, totally.  If it was anything else.  But it was a bunch of circumstances that didn't equal to a good equation.  Yeah.  Hey, another cameo, was that Bobcat?  It certainly was.  As a, what was he?  I can't feel my face.  Yeah, yeah, near the end of the movie?  That line was totally improv.  It's funny.  My casting director, Ava Kaufman, who's cast a lot of my films, she, you know, I said, 
[01:41:00]  look, I got this one great scene.  Let's put so much fun in it.  And Bobcat walked in the door one day, and I just started laughing.  I hadn't seen him in a while.  And he sat down and, yeah, you know, I'm good.  You know, I started talking.  And I just said, look, man, you didn't even have to read.  You got it if you wanted.  I love it.  Yeah.  And we did that scene, and he comes up with that great line, because it's the biggest  laugh in the movie.  And he's, you know, he's really cool, because he, I saw him afterwards, and he's like, I  really don't know why he put me in this movie. 
[01:41:30]  Don't talk your way out of it, pal.  You got the job.  I have to ask you, though, is he sick?  Bobcat?  Yeah.  No, he's actually in great shape.  I mean, I know he went on that, the weight loss thing, but now it looks like he took it  a little too far.  No, he actually looks great, believe it or not.  Yeah, he's got, we put that wig on him, and we pasted him up, and wanted him to look  a little kind of, you know, white, if you will, for that scene, like a guy who spends  a little too much time inside.  So, no, he looks great, actually.  And Penelope Cruz.  Yeah, she's pretty good, isn't she?  Please tell me you got naked pictures of her that you're going to send us.  Well, she's naked here with me right now. 
[01:42:00]  You want to call her?  Nice.  Man.  She's, you know, it's funny, because I got her about, you know, I cast her about it,  God, probably about a year and a half ago.  You know, it was kind of before, you know, Penelope Mania hit, if you will, and, you know,  I just kind of watched her as we were shooting, you know, get the Ralph Lauren ads, and get  this, and get that, and she just held herself together so well, and she's just a, she's  just one of those, like, she's just a cool chick, you know what I mean?  She's like, and the fact that she's got an accent just takes her right over the fence.  Okay.  There's a couple people a little past, uh, Kevin's saying, Ted is downplaying the problems 
[01:42:30]  drugs have caused in America.  Who's saying this?  A guy named Kevin.  Okay.  And Andy's saying, uh, Demi should see how bad Coke really is.  I think he showed that in the movie.  Okay.  Maybe they should see the film, and, yeah, just himself.  I mean, a lot of people who knocked the film haven't seen it, and they think we're glorifying,  you know, drug use, because the name of the movie is below, but, you know, if you watch  the last 20 minutes, I think it's the biggest anti-drug, you know, commercial there is.  Yeah.  I'm going to turn off the last 20 minutes and just go out and have a fun time with Coke. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Just watch the first half, get an eight ball, and you'll be fine.  You watch the movie backwards, and, and, and drugs, uh, seem cool.  Exactly.  That's right.  Just like that movie, Memento.  I recut it like that film, Memento.  I'll start with the end and go backwards.  Yeah.  Yeah, it makes you lose a lot of weight, and it makes you young, and you get out of prison.  And you wear a really bad mullet.  It'll be great.  Yeah, well, that guy, Andy, has a mullet haircut himself.  Yeah, was that Johnny Depp's, uh, real hair?  You make, make him grow it out like that?  Uh, a little bit of both. 
[01:43:30]  We mixed, some of the scenes, obviously, where he has short hair, it's a wig, and, and he,  sometimes when it gets longer, we mixed, um, his real hair with, with, uh, a wig, and,  of course, the mullet's not his real hair.  That, that would be courtesy of a wig factory.  Right.  And, uh, Joey on Line 7, Ted has inspired my friend to be a drug dealer.  Nice!  I'm just here to help, guys.  I said, you started with MTV, right?  Yeah, I worked as AFPA back in 1986, if you can believe it or not, MTV, and, um, in 88,  I created Yo! 
[01:44:00]  MTV Raps, and, um, met Dennis Leary, did some commercials with Dennis on MTV, so, yeah, it  was a great training ramp.  You were responsible for Yo! MTV Raps?  If you can believe that at all, yeah.  Oh, God damn.  I know.  I used to hate it, because it was on all the time.  I know.  And I was at the point where I wanted to just see rock on MTV like it was, and then all of  a sudden they turn it on, and there's, what, a Fab Five Freddy or something, or whatever  that happened.  Come on, you wanted to be Fab Five Freddy.  Come on.  I mean, who didn't?  Who didn't?  Come on.  Turn on MTV now, and you could be like the Backstreet Boys.  Yeah, yes. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, what do you think of, uh, yeah, the music scene and MTV and all that?  I mean, you were there from the beginning.  Well, not the beginning.  Yeah, almost.  I mean, I was there, like, you know, for, you know, right after the first five years,  when, you know, it kind of kicked in.  I mean, you know, it's like, it's funny, because I have this conversation with friends  a lot, it's like, kind of what came first conversation, which I'm sure you guys have  all the time, is like, did, was bad music happening first and everyone started buying  it, or, like, if they took their bad music away, would people start buying good music?  Like, there's a lot of great music that is out there right now, but no one buys it,  because there's not five little faggy boys doing a line dance, you know? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  And it's like, and it's like, you know, enough of these, you know, it's like,  it's just the same crap recycled over and over again.  It's frustrating, but it's a lot of good music out there, but it's just not breaking  through, because, again, it's not what people want, people want to buy.  So it's really, you know, I think the music scene, there's some really good music going  on, but it's just not being marketed.  Well, you've got to blame MTV and VH1 and radio in general for not taking the chances  anymore, either. 
[01:45:30]  It's all marketed and packaged.  I know.  You know?  It's all prefab, you're right.  I mean, it's, uh...  I mean, music used to mean something.  Now it's just big business.  I know.  It's, you know, it's just like movies.  You can make the same argument for movies.  I mean, there's a lot of really, really great movies coming out, but there's a lot of really,  really bad movies that are out.  And unfortunately, a lot of these bad movies make a lot of the money because they go for  the lowest common denominator.  And, like, there's great movies.  Like, I was just joking, like, that movie Memento is just like a masterpiece. 
[01:46:00]  And, like, no one's going to see it because, you know, it doesn't have 12 fart jokes  per second in it.  Hey, for every bad movie out there, at least we have one Joe Dirt.  Yeah, I have a feeling you made a fun of Joe Dirt there, Ted.  Yeah, Joe Dirt's going to win a lot of awards, I think.  David Spade used to be a friend of mine until this week.  He went on a TV show and said, yeah, I saw Blow.  It should be called Slow.  Uh-oh.  I was like, thanks, Dave.  And he's in Joe Dirt.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll go see Joe Dirt and I'll come back on your going show and we'll talk about it.  Hey, Ted, okay, I have a question for you. 
[01:46:30]  Sure.  A movie like Joe Dirt, and a lot of these movies come out, especially comedies, and it's  so obvious to everyone that the movie just sucks.  Right.  The movie blows, no pun intended.  Right.  But the bigwigs in Hollywood, they have to see the film before they throw it at us,  the consumers or whatever, the movie viewers.  Right.  And what do they do at that point?  Just go, what the hell, they'll go see it anyway?  Or do they try to clean it up, make it funny?  I mean, what goes on?  No, I think they know going into it.  I mean, you know, unfortunately with Hollywood and, you know, probably on the same extent 
[01:47:00]  what you guys are talking about with music, I mean, there's a certain formula that works.  You know what I mean?  You make a certain film like a Joe Dirt, they make it for a certain price.  They put a certain type of star in it, like David, that has a certain type of audience  that goes to these type of movies, which is mostly, you know, teenage boys that are  probably smoking two bongs in their car and they're going to go in, they don't care  what they're going to see.  But these kids go and watch these movies over and over again, and it doesn't make it,  you know, it's just a formula.  So a lot of these movies that you're talking about are just caught in this formula of you 
[01:47:30]  put a guy like this in it, you make it for this type of money, it'll open for this weekend,  we'll put it on DVD and we'll make a fortune.  I know, it's a drag.  And it's like, it's what we're talking about with music too.  It's like, get these guys, put them in these tights, have them sing these songs, do these  little, you know, have a chorus like this and it'll sell this amount of money.  So it used to be that if it didn't do anything at the box office, that was it.  You were effed.  Now, like Deuce Bigelow bombing at the box office.  But for some reason, then people rented that thing like crazy.  I know. 
[01:48:00]  And you know what, man?  You'd be surprised because I thought it bombed the box office too.  It didn't.  It did money, man.  Those movies make money.  People go and see those flicks.  That's a new thing that people say with movies too.  You know, did you see such and such movie?  And they'll go, oh, it's a good rental.  Right, exactly.  It sucks in the theater, but when you rent it, it's a good rental.  That's because you can watch it at home and you can pause it and go through what you've  got to do and come back to it, I guess.  So basically, you're saying the creative process is taking like a backseat.  Totally.  I mean, it's like, again, there's so many great, you know, and we're jokingly kidding  about Joe Dirks.  David is a friend. 
[01:48:30]  But it's like, there is, it's frustrating for me even because...  We should say, the movie's not good.  I'm sorry.  Well, I haven't seen it, so I can't comment.  But, you know, the point is like for me, for example, like to make a movie called Blow  where, first of all, just with that title, just about what the content is, and then just  to present a guy who is the character, who George Young is, as a real person, not as  a Tony Montana guy.  Well, people like are flipping out of that, like the reactions that, you know, even just 
[01:49:00]  what we're getting just today, it's like, people aren't ready for that stuff.  Why?  Because it's different.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, it's a drag, like, we'll go back to Memento again, the film where, you  know, it's so original, like they tell the whole movie, I don't know if you guys have  seen it.  Now, can you explain that real fast?  Yeah, they start at the end of the movie and they rewind to the beginning.  And it's unbelievably cool and so well acted and so original.  But, you know, people here, oh, I don't want to go see that.  I can't see that.  How's that going to happen?  You know?  And, you know, so it's frustrating, but there's a lot of people that, fortunately, a lot of people 
[01:49:30]  that are going to start greenlighting films are guys that have been working through, like  guys my age, 37, 38, that are hopefully going to try to get some new movies out there.  And there's a lot of fantastic filmmakers working right now, so.  Right on.  Well, this has been a lot of fun.  I'll tell you one other thing about Blow.  Sure.  Bravo on the movie soundtrack.  Oh, great.  Did you guys, I'm hoping you guys dig that, yeah.  It's, you know, I wanted to make, I've always wanted to put Marshall Tucker Band and Leonard  Skinner because I'm from Long Island.  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:50:00]  I'm from Long Island.  What part of the island?  My very first concert, you know, I got on the L.A.R.R., went to Madison Square Garden  and saw, you know, Charlie Daniels Band, Marshall Tucker and the Outlaws.  Oh, I was there.  And then I saw Skinner, and those guys just changed my life, and I always wanted to put  them, you know, in a film.  And so we had a lot of fun with the soundtrack, Man for Man, Earth Band, you know, Blinded  by the Light.  Black Betty, Black Betty, Black Betty.  That's right.  And throwing over the stones, I mean, you know, we had to beg, borrow, and, you know, plead  to get that song from Mr. Jagger and Company, but he graciously gave it to us, so. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, Ted, you ever go to any of the shows at the old Long Island Arena in Comac?  Oh, my God.  They used to roller skate there.  Isn't that funny?  Dude, they used to have disco roller skates back in the 70s there, man.  That was the bomb.  The roller rink.  Peter Frampton.  Frampton played there.  Ten years after Fox had James' game.  And it always looked like the roof was going to fall in on you.  I know, and they had that really bad lighting, I remember, really vividly.  And, like, yeah, that was great. 
[01:51:00]  You were skating on the general admission floor because it was covered in vomit.  It was great.  Exactly.  Because inevitably someone would puke going around on the roller skates and no one would  clean it up.  That was me.  Oh, very good.  Thank you.  Hey, what part of Long Island are you from?  I grew up in Rockville Center.  Rockville Center.  There you go.  Yeah, I'm a South Shore boy.  I still got my four best friends still live there.  My mom still lives there, so.  It's the law if you're from Long Island.  You need your four best friends.  Yeah, don't you?  Exactly.  You have to be on Long Island.  Your four best friends that you went to school with, that you've known since you were 12, 
[01:51:30]  that, you know, da-da-da-da-da.  I got two of them here right now.  There you go.  You know what I'm talking about.  That's what I mean.  I made a film a few years ago called Beautiful Girls, and that's basically where that came  from.  You know, it's a bunch of guys that have been lifelong friends, so.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right, Ted.  Guys, thanks a lot, man.  You guys are great.  It was really great talking.  And girls, put your tops on, for God's sake.  Hey, shut up.  Hey.  He's going to ruin it.  Put your tops on the country, mate.  Yeah.  We're going to do blow off their cans in a minute.  Yeah.  In honor of the movie Blow. 
[01:52:00]  All right, guys.  Thanks, Ted.  Thank you.  Have a great day, everybody.  Thanks.  Ted Demme.  Hey, that's a cool guy.  That was really cool.  Look at that.  Guys, see, Long Island people, they kind of do keep very well-rooted.  You know what I mean?  You get those Hollywood-type directors, and that's just another schmo from Long Island that made  good.  Roller skating in the 70s.  How about that?  Huh?  Yeah, we're from Long Island.  Huntington.  Huntington area.  Representing.  Babylon.  Babylon.  Babylon.  Nice.  Troy South Shore chicks. 
[01:52:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  Right down 231.  Yeah, they always have the same kids.  Got to go down to Bayshore.  All right.  We'll get back to the naked bartender.  Bacardi bartender's next, right?  Yeah.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Want to go to the FU line?  It's FU Friday.  Here we go.  Jesse, the intern, is a retard, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.

Yeah, Joey told me you were there.  Yeah.  I didn't see Joey, the figurehead.  No, I know.  He told me that.  Anthony didn't tell me he was coming in last night.  And there were some listeners in there looking over. 
[01:55:00]  I saw him.  And they can verify, what beer was I drinking?  Sam Adams lager.  And I really was.  Sometimes I lie.  And I say I'm drinking Sam, and maybe it wasn't available.  Wait a minute.  I'm on to you.  I was drinking Sam.  How do we know that you're not lying right now?  Now, I swear to you, I was drinking Sam Adams lager last night at Paisano's.  All right.  And you know I usually go for a Chimay.  But last night I was like, I am in the mood for a Sam Adams lager. 
[01:55:30]  And the Summer Ale is here, too.  Yep.  It's summertime, Summer Ale.  They've got a lot of great seasonal beers.  And we love it.  Try them out.  Check it out.  It's not watered down.  It doesn't taste like some of the crappy beers that are out there now.  Sam Adams.  The guy takes some time.  Jim Cook.  Making sure every batch, every batch is just the way it should be.  And we're going back to Boston this summer.  Yeah.  We're going to go up to the brewery again, and we're going to bring some of you guys.  It's going to be great.  Have a good time. 
[01:56:00]  It talks about this Grains of Paradise stuff, an ancient brewing spice that used to be considered an aphrodisiac.  Yeah, I guess it makes the beer taste even better.  And an aphrodisiac.  You know what happens to the bottle when you're done?  What happens?  Disappears.  Ah.  You got a nice chick with you.  Yeah, she's drinking the Sam.  You're drinking it.  All of a sudden, it's stock to test it and recommend it.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  I thought it was enough.  I thought it was every other sponsor.  No.  We love it.  Sam Adams.  Go out and get yourself a Sam Adams.  Yeah.  If you enjoyed the show this week, I mean, you know, come on. 
[01:56:30]  Everyone's off work.  Most people are off work.  Yeah.  Help us out.  Help our sponsors out.  And have a Sam Adams tonight.  Yes.  Anthony.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Anthony.  Anthony.  I'm over here. 
[01:57:00]  I'm over here.  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony.  Anthony.  I'm over here now.  Anthony.  Shut the hell out.  Anthony.  Oh, okay.  Terrific.  Those guys are fine.  1-8-2-7-7-7-E-W.  Oi. 
[01:57:30]  You got to love topless Bacardi bartender.  Yeah.  Look at the backs.  Very shapely nice backs.  Good job.  Making drinks.  Lots of people in the studio.  Your brother's here.  Joe just showed up with the entire ensemble of rap cuts.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  You bellied up to the bar?  Yeah.  They're getting their drinks.  You like the topless bartenders?  You picked a good day.  They're enjoying it. 
[01:58:00]  Rex says it's a fine working environment.  See?  Yeah, it doesn't suck.  Yeah.  Hey, Rex, they got some Cuban drink.  You might want to try that one.  Please.  They do.  I got one.  What is this called?  Mojito.  A mojito?  Mojito.  What does mojito mean?  I'm a mojito.  What does mojito mean?  Rex is Cuban.  What does that mean?  Is that it?  What's a mojito?  It means drink Bacardi.  Make something up.  I speak Spanish.  I'll handle this.  No songs. 
[01:58:30]  It's just a name they made up.  It tastes good.  That's all that matters.  The Bacardi Mojito.  The allure of freshness.  It doesn't taste as good as the Bacardi Crows.  Oh, you got that right, honey.  Look at Bill.  That's right, brother.  Are we going to be doing body shots soon?  Hey, how about body shots?  Where's Stinky?  Body shots or what?  Stinky.  You want Stinky to do a body shot off of one of you chicks?  Yeah.  Do you know something?  We could fill up the little part of your lower back. 
[01:59:00]  You know the little part of the lower back?  We call that the splooge trough.  The little part of the lower back.  You could fill it up with some mojito.  Mojito and Stinky could do a shot.  What do you say?  I could do a shot.  The highest bidder.  You got to take care of Stinky.  Look at the boy.  Yeah, take care of Stinky.  Look at him.  He's even wearing the Bacardi hat.  Look at him.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Look at him smiling, trying to work it. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, what are we doing?  I can get you a plug at work tonight.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Bill's working a tip hand.  Tip hand.  Hey, that was pretty good, Bill.  That's not bad.  What do you think?  What do you think?  About a lower back shot for Stinky.  Stinky can have the lower back shot.  All right.  Lay down on the table or a chair or something?  You just got to tell me how to do this because not really.  Can I have the upper front shot?  Well, I was calling it lower back, but sure.  Wait, turn around, turn around. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah, right in there.  She can't bend over, though.  She's got to be laying flat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll hold you down.  Get up on the console.  Yeah.  Hey, do you like hot wax being dripped on you?  That's the last girl that was laying up there.  We had that done to her.  Does she like the hot wax, right?  Yeah, that's the best eating out of us.  All right.  Let me hold that.  You don't have to understand nothing.  You just got to lay there.  All right.  We're pouring the beer down the...  Yeah, perch your ass up like that. 
[02:00:30]  She's so nice.  That has nothing to do with what we're doing.  I just wanted her to do it.  Is this...  Is this...  Wait.  Is this stinky cam on or are we taking...  It's broken right now.  Are we taking digital shots, too?  Yeah.  Because this ass has to be recorded.  Steve's taking video.  We can get all kinds of...  Oh, look at that.  I said shots.  I was saying shots off of that.  That's dumb.  Oh, you stopped moving.  Put the whole bottle.  That's a big shot.  There you go, stinky.  Lap it up.  Attack from the south, stinky. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  None of this side door crap.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Nice.  Nice.  Hey, I want to take my pup in.  Good job.  Okay, well, I'm here.  One more.  Anyone else get it while you're here?  Bill, you're up.  Cowbell Bill.  No, I don't do shots.  I don't do shots.  I don't do shots.  I don't do shots.  I don't do shots.  I don't do shots.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Joe.  There you go.  Brother Joe.  He then did a shot off of her back. 
[02:01:30]  Which distressed to the plaintiff.  How messed up is this show?  We go from talking to...  We go from talking to Ted Demme, a respected director, or this new movie, Blow, that's  out.  Yeah.  Where people were getting scared, going, man, you guys sound a little too intelligent during  that segment.  And now we're back to being idiots.  Yeah, that's kind of stupid.  Why aren't we doing coke off our ass?  All right.  Anyone else? 
[02:02:00]  It's tight enough.  Who else?  Pour the next shot.  Who's up?  Who's up?  Come on.  Let's go.  Who's up?  Come on, guys.  She smells like coconuts.  Who's up?  Nice.  Yeah.  We have codes here.  If you don't want your name on the radio, you just raise your hand.  We'll just say Exhibit A.  Tyrannosaurus Rex.  I mean...  P.R., what's up?  Figures you come back.  What did he say?  The small of her back is very lovely. 
[02:02:30]  It makes a good trough.  Very nice.  Shots of rum.  Very nice.  Shots of Bacotti.  There you go, P.R.  There you go.  Just imagine how many times someone blasted one right there, P.R.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, come on.  The rum sterilizes it, man.  It's sterilized.  Yeah, it's sterile.  That's cool.  That's cool.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  Actually, it was just last night.  Well...  And she came straight from work.  Exactly.  That's cool.  I'm out.  Anybody in my son of here?  Anyone else?  Anyone else?  How about we get the Russian mobs to do one?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  All right.  We've got to welcome Igor to the show.  Igor, you are a striking resemblance of Meadow.  Hey, Igor, why do you have a Star of David around your neck?  Because I am a Jewish boy. 
[02:03:30]  A nice, nice Jewish boy.  A Russian Jewish guy?  Yes.  Oh, of course.  You've got to leave her a little bit.  She does look...  As long as she's out of Slupercardi.  She looks like Meadow a little bit, right, Igor?  She does have a lot like Meadow.  You know, the front, the bottom, the vodka.  There you go.  Wow, Igor, relax.  I'm just lurping that up.  Wow.  Some parts of Russia, you guys would be married.  Where'd that go?  Igor.  Damn.  Here, take a seat over here so we can talk to you.  Drink the vodka from our lower back, but just don't come up with an olive. 
[02:04:00]  You can play Find the Olive.  You know what?  Because I saw the initial...  Of the picture.  Yeah, you just can't use that T word.  Say cans, whatever you want.  Buns.  Bun bag.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, yeah, the initial flop was seen through the glass, which I was a little insulted,  but that well made up for everything.  Why were you insulted?  Because I wanted to see him, right, you know, live.  Oh, that you weren't in here when they happened. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, you knew we were pulling you in before this.  Of course.  Come on.  Igor, you're liking that, right?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Nice.  I got tattoos, too.  Oh.  But, you know, not as well.  Now, Igor...  Igor was in The Sopranos.  Yes.  We get all the big stars from The Sopranos on our show.  There you go.  Igor, he beat up Tony's sister with the fake leg.  That's correct.  She took the leg.  Oh, I forgot about that.  And they brought the Russian mob in. 
[02:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  That was me.  And beat her up.  I cracked her.  Which is great, because I cannot stand her on the show.  You know what's funny?  Everybody tells me the same thing.  Oh, I'm so glad you did it.  I'm so glad you did it.  And I go, hey.  She's horrible.  Yeah, she is.  In person, she's good.  She's a good person.  I wouldn't even like her in person.  I can tell.  I don't know.  Because of her, I don't like the Rolling Stones anymore.  But that's the Stones tactic.  Is that a real cat?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know.  You didn't ask her?  I didn't get that.  You kicked her ass.  Well, I kicked her ass.  I don't want to talk to her. 
[02:05:30]  I got you.  Hey, Igor, do the line.  The line?  The line from Sopranos.  Come on.  You're going to wink at me when I do it now.  I know it, man.  I mean, what?  Awful what?  I'm looking at...  All right, here we go.  Here it was.  Here's Igor from The Sopranos.  Mother what?  What did you say?  And then she goes,  Mother fucker.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  All right, start over and just say Mother Effer.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  He's used to HBO.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mother what?  What did you say?  Mother Effer.  Crack.  Nice.  Nice.  There it is.  Beautiful.  Nice.  Wow.  Forget that Shakespeare stuff.  You're going to be on again, right?  Yeah, this Sunday.  This coming Sunday.  And you said you had a big part.  Yeah, a big part.  Big earth one. 
[02:06:30]  You're going to have two lines.  Meadow Sopranos is going to give me a rusty trombone.  Nice.  I'm going to have it.  That's good.  He did his homework.  Hey, as long as it's not a ditsun.  And then after that, Tony Soprano finds out and he gives me a turkey eye.  A turkey eye?  Turkey eye.  What's a turkey eye?  It's when Tony Soprano used to take my balls.  He used to take both balls and squeeze them to one side.  And then take Carmelo's high heel shoe and whack it.  And that's called a turkey eye. 
[02:07:00]  Because it ends up looking like a turkey eye.  I figured I would introduce a new one to the show.  That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.  Did they get on the radio, you think?  Well, if it didn't, I'll describe it.  You take your yam bag and squeeze one side of it so both marbles are in one side of the yam bag.  Make it look like the monster from Bugs Bunny.  Right.  The monster head from Bugs Bunny.  Monsters are such interesting people.  And then you take a high heeled shoe and you smack one of them with a high heel. 
[02:07:30]  And it looks like a turkey eye.  Yeah, turkey eye.  Hey, Igor.  You're all right, man.  You can hang with us.  Oh, it's a turkey eye.  Well, you know, I have been a fan for three years now.  Nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've been listening since you guys had the old phones.  I don't know, O.P. was going on.  When he destroyed the phone.  Where's the sound?  Where's the sound?  Let's hear that one.  I love that one.  I think it might be this one.  Yeah.  Hang on.  Oh, my God.  The best part of that clip is that's when Ben really didn't know about me. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, he said, oh, my God.  He couldn't believe that someone was that insane.  Now, next week, you're on The Sopranos.  Yeah.  You're driving a cab.  Yeah.  What do you do?  I can't explain anymore.  I was sworn on the secrecy.  Yeah, but you could explain what kind of you're doing.  Did you get whacked?  I can't say.  Oh, he gets whacked.  That's good.  I can't say.  You know, if I do get a refill from one of the tapas bartenders.  Yeah, get him drunk.  He'll spill everything.  I may be able to go into more detail.  He'll spill everything.  Does the cab have a wow sticker on it? 
[02:08:30]  Ah, that would be nice.  If it doesn't, I will go into the editing room and put one on myself.  Ah, there you go.  And then Christopher breaks on his neck.  Fantastic.  And in the last episode.  You're smooth.  I like that.  You see how he's working the naked bartenders?  Yeah.  I'm used to nudity in my life.  Shorts are wet.  Exactly me.  Yeah, I bet they are.  Everybody.  Do I make you wet?  That's cool.  Nice, naked bartender. 
[02:09:00]  Ah, Boris, what's going on?  Boris.  Boris.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Can I speak to Igor?  Yeah, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Yeah.  In our Russian language.  Yeah.  What's happening now?  How do you look at the girls?  Tell me.  Oh, хорошо.  They have these big kids.  Hey.  Yeah.  Nice.  This is universal language, baby.  That's universal.  It sounds like the radio on the car service I take in sometimes.  Everybody's got their finger on the dump on the... 
[02:09:30]  Nah, don't worry.  We just gave each other code blue.  Yeah, yeah, that was code blue.  Y'all are going to be bombed in a couple of minutes.  What's a code blue?  Oh, yeah.  One of those Model T rockets you guys got over there.  Exactly.  Hey, I'm driving the bomb car right now.  Yeah, good luck.  All right.  See you later, dude.  Big.  All right, boys.  We are mighty Soviet Union.  212-757-1027.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  Do you like hot wax?  Because we could drip the hot wax on you.  We do that.  That's always fun.  That's a fun little game now.  Can we bring in the lesbian couch?  Are you too friendly at all?  Oh, lesbian couch, yeah.  Oh, look.  She's going, no, no, no.  Come on.  I'll throw a wig on.  Related is even better.  Related is even better.  Jim, what's going on?  Jim.  Yeah.  What's up?  Not much.  I was over at the auto show.  I was working over there, and I saw Melissa and your van, and I dropped two tickets off for 
[02:10:30]  you guys.  For the auto show?  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  The auto show?  The New York auto show at the Javits.  The O&A van is there?  It was there until 2.30.  Oh, that's a good time.  At the auto show.  That's great.  What not to do to a vehicle.  What kind of concept cars do they have this year?  They have a bunch of concept cars.  But I work...  I love the concept cars, because none of that stuff ever...  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was watching on TNN this weekend to have the truck shows, right?  GMC makes this new pickup truck. 
[02:11:00]  The cab is, I think, five feet.  It extends to eight feet.  And then the sides come out.  There's tools inside.  It's unbelievable.  It was a concept car, but it was beautiful.  No one gets to drive those things.  I know.  You see them at the car shows, and that's it.  I know.  I know.  All right, Jim.  We'll...  Thank you, Jim.  No, we didn't get the tickets.  Because Earl's trying to...  Probably snagging for a show.  No, Earl's trying to find his way back to the station, I'm sure.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, Earl got back, we heard, at like nine o'clock to the station from the sticker stop 
[02:11:30]  the other night.  I was leaving to go to the Met game at, like, 7.05.  He passed right by the front of this building.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I left...  What time did I leave?  7.30?  Yeah.  4 to 8?  Earl was heading east on 57.  Dude.  Like four blocks that way.  You want to know what he says it was?  He says it was a garbage truck near the garage, and he was too afraid to hit it.  How come I pulled out?  That's what he said.  I pulled out as he passed by.  If I could get out, he could have gotten in. 
[02:12:00]  This guy...  I couldn't get through.  There's someone pulling out.  You're trying to get Earl?  All right.  He is the worst driver, and they put him out on this sticker stop.  He's driving the van.  The day of the Vanderbilt, we leave here, he sideswipes a car on 7th Avenue.  He's a mirror.  I swear to God, the mirror hits.  Boom.  Earl's like, oh, it's no big deal.  Guy pulls up.  He's like, mother effer.  Earl's like, sorry, dude.  Here's the wow sticker.  A prime example is when he was in charge of speeding away from the scene when we gave up 
[02:12:30]  the ending of Star Wars.  Remember the new Star Wars that came out?  And Earl was supposed to drive the getaway vehicle as the van is being pelted with rocks  and other memorabilia that we handed out before.  Because we pulled up.  Earl's driving.  Rick had a bullhorn, and he starts yelling out the ending of the new Star Wars that came  out.  And then he yells, Earl, hit it.  Go.  Go.  I'm blocked in.  You weren't even in the van.  Because you're not blocked in.  He was in the van.  Earl's the worst driver.  The worst driver ever. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, Earl.  Earl, you like the naked bartenders from Bacardi?  Smoking.  Earl should do a shot.  Earl, you want to do a shot?  No.  No, thank you.  Huh?  No, I don't drink.  Earl's got the lower lip drag that Dice was talking about.  Oh, my God.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Earl, do a shot.  Where's the gun?  Earl, do a shot.  Opie, when are you going to do a shot?  Do a shot.  You want to do a shot off one of the girls?  After everyone else licked you? 
[02:13:30]  No, thanks.  Hey, here's my shot.  I'm holding you on.  You're a ditchel.  Hey, Earl.  Do a shot.  Do you want to do a shot, Earl?  No, not at all.  What?  Why not?  No, I don't drink.  That's a fine white woman.  I'm not.  Come on.  I'm not just kidding that at all.  Earl, you don't drink.  Earl, why aren't you looking at the girls?  Because he's gay.  Oh, my God.  He does have the gay hand.  No, he does, girls.  Earl, I was so drunk.  Earl, I was so drunk drinking right now.  Yeah, now's a good time to stop. 
[02:14:00]  He's definitely listening to me up, Earl.  Earl.  I'm big dick black.  Stare at the girls.  Take a look.  Take a look at the girls.  Take a look at the girls.  Keep looking.  I'm mocking.  Take a look.  Do a shot.  Take a look.  Don't drink.  I'm sorry.  You ever see a black man blush?  Come on, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  We're still wondering why nobody calls for us. 
[02:14:30]  I'll call for you.  They're calling.  They're calling for you.  We're just keeping them away.  Right.  Keep you for ourselves.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Are you going to have a drink at least, Earl?  Earl.  I already had one.  Do you want to do a little shot off of my mouth?  I already had one.  You know how much liquor you actually get?  You said you don't drink, and now you're saying you already had one?  You get more liquor than liquor.  That's some Diet Coke.  I don't drink.  He had the Coke part of the Bacardian Coke.  Oh, that's the...  Oh, yeah.  That's a great point.  How about we wedge a joint between our boobs?  No.  Earl, don't smoke pot either. 
[02:15:00]  Earl, what do you say?  No, I was coming back from...  Regarding the...  That garbage truck was blocking the entrance,  and I didn't even notice it until I was making the turnoff.  Well, let's talk about garbage trucks.  And by the time I did notice it, I didn't...  It was too late to make the turn, so I just spun around the block.  Too late to make the turn.  You were doing a mile an hour.  It's traffic out.  And I was able to pull out.  How could you not pull in?  Earl, as I said...  The same spot.  Earl, why are you afraid to drive in Manhattan? 
[02:15:30]  We've all noticed that.  No, it's only driving, period.  Why?  I don't know.  It's just...  I guess it's a mental thing.  The best Earl driving story is the day that he could not give directions to his own house.  Of course, baby.  Because I never drive home.  I take the subway home.  Ben, grab the mic.  That is the best story.  Yeah.  What?  I don't drive home.  I never drive home.  Only the...  Ben, where were you guys coming from?  We were coming from somewhere.  You guys were hammered anyway.  You didn't know where you were going?  Oh, shut up, Earl.  First of all, we were coming back from somewhere on Long Island, me, you, and Mark, and we ended 
[02:16:00]  up...  Earl was like, oh, let's go here, let's go here.  No, no, no, we ended up at friggin' JFK at two in the morning.  We had to drop Earl off in a subway, because that's the only way he could figure out how  to get on.  He lives in the Delta Terminal.  No, I was screaming at them.  Never mind.  I give up.  I surrender.  We don't...  No, Earl.  I surrender.  Wait, wait, no.  We're trying...  I don't understand why you can't give directions to someone.  Because I don't drive.  I take the subway home.  I take the subway everywhere.  If I don't drive everywhere, if I don't drive regularly, what's the road? 
[02:16:30]  You live...  What's the main road that you live closest to?  I'm right off of Yellowstone Boulevard.  So how hard could it be?  I don't drive.  I don't drive.  So what happened that night?  You guys just was going around in circles?  We went around in circles.  We got to JFK.  Mark almost killed Earl.  Earl almost killed Mark, and we ended up dropping you off at a subway station.  I always almost killed Mark when we get in the van.  When we drove to the Vanderbilt, I almost threw Mark out of the van going to the Vanderbilt. 
[02:17:00]  He pissed me off so bad.  You can't drive with anybody.  That's just like the L.I.E., and then you bang a right.  No, no, no, but Mark was...  You should have been in the van with Mark.  Ah, Earl.  Yeah, Mark is on the phone.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  Earl, you drive like old people F.  Worse than that.  I think old people F better than you drive, guaranteed.  Mark, what happened that day?  He couldn't find his house?  Couldn't find his house.  He couldn't...  I'm surprised he could find, like, the Statue of Liberty.  Yeah, he couldn't give directions. 
[02:17:30]  I knew where it was.  I didn't know where it was.  You put Earl at four foot by four foot blocks.  I told him, man, to Queens Boulevard, Yellowstone Boulevard exit.  You need a piece of paper in your pocket like they give the Alzheimer's people, right?  And you just go, I gotta go home.  And you give it to the cop, and he calls your family and drives you home.  Gives you an ice cream with a little cop hat sideways on your head.  Earl needs a big bag of flour.  Or he needs to poke a little hole in it and drag it behind him so he can remind himself where he was. 
[02:18:00]  Earl, you got a problem with kids picking you up?  Of course I do.  So you say you take the Underground Railroad home every day?  I take the subway.  Don't give up your subway.  All right, Earl.  I don't get it, but thank you, Psycho Mark.  You're welcome.  You're missing a good one today.  Oh, shit.  He's having a party on his own.  Oh, socks.  Yeah, yeah.  Watch it, 6 o'clock.  I'm going to kick the heck of his head.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to kick the heck of his head.  Shut up.  Go, Sox. 
[02:18:30]  All right, let's take a break.  Another season of heartbreak for Boston.  Thank God.  We're getting some requests for the Arnold Schwarzenegger prank calls.  How are you?  Which one is this?  The barbecue place?  Yeah, no, I'll do this one.  Scott.  You son of a bitch.  How are you?  All right.  Who do you want to speak with?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  John Kimball?  Yes.  This is Scott's barbecue.  I eat with Charles Kimball?  Yeah.  I asked for somebody named Charles Kimball.  Charles Kimball. 
[02:19:00]  So could you describe Charles Kimball?  Yes.  Could you tell him Mr. Kimball up?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Detective.  Oh, he's a detective, John Kimball.  Hey, I'm a police officer.  Oh.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Um, excuse me, sir, but this is, hi, block you.  This is not a police station.  I love that one.  John has a problem with us on line nine.  Why?  We're going to take a break.  I don't know. 
[02:19:30]  John, what's up?  Well, I've heard your program, I'd say, about a half a dozen times, and I find it demeaning.  I'm ashamed that it's one of the top-rated programs in the area.  You appeal to the lowest common denominator, and I guess there is just no socially redeeming  value to anything that you guys do there.  How long can you attempt to shock people?  Thank you.  Uh, John, I think we do more than shock people.  Um, what do you listen to?  That's so great.  What do I listen to?  You obviously listen to us, so. 
[02:20:00]  I actually, well, I, I, I, I, I, I've heard you about a half a dozen times.  I generally listen, I generally listen to, uh, guys that used to be on your station over  at WFUV.  So much, uh.  Ah.  WFUV.  John.  If you would have given us a, uh, given us a credible station.  John, you just wrecked your whole argument by saying that.  Well, why would I do that?  You'd rather, uh, hear the same old DJs playing the same old tunes.  That's what you want.  So go away.  Go away.  That station is totally eclectic.  They play all kinds of good music.  It's not, uh, it's not the same old DJs playing the same old music. 
[02:20:30]  Well, obviously someone like you is not going to like, uh, this type of show.  That's all right.  There's enough people out there that enjoy it.  Yeah, so why does it bother you so much that you have to call us?  You said commentary on, uh, human, humanity.  Yeah, indeed it is.  I think when they, when I tell you, when they, when they write the, uh, the book, the decline  and fall of the American empire, I think they can take your particular program.  I hope we get a page. 
[02:21:00]  It would, it would be the prologue to the book, okay?  We are the majority, John.  I know, but that's why we're on the decline.  Hey, John, I'll take it on the decline any day.  I, I, I consider that a compliment.  And I hope that, uh, little, uh, soundbite, uh, makes it to a promo.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'd rather be in a world that's on the decline than this, uh, world that you think, uh, could,  could happen somewhere.  John, in your...  What, where everybody gets along and everything's nice.  John, in your ideal...  Faggy.  In your ideal world, what would you want to hear right now on the radio?  Right this second. 
[02:21:30]  What would I want to hear right now, this second?  Mm-hmm.  Good question, Opie.  Well, how about, why don't you go into the archives, why don't you pick out, how about  a Bob Dylan song and play, uh, like a woman's song?  Your argument gets worse and worse, Tool.  I think it gets worse and worse.  You can't even pick out a good Dylan tune.  You picked out the one that's been on the radio 10 million times.  Okay, how about...  Let's just play some Dylan and contemplate life.  Jack off.  Why don't you turn on, how about if you don't, if you don't like...  Get me coffee.  What?  I, I, I gotta go.  Take care.  All right, John, you did a good job. 
[02:22:00]  Very good.  Why is he even listening to us?  I gotta go trim his mullet.  Why, why listen to this show a half a dozen times?  You check in once, you know what you're getting.  Right.  I mean, why, what, you want to hear Dylan?  Besides, everyone knows that you have to listen to the show at least 10 to 12 times to get it.  Right, a half dozen, you're not going to get it.  Before you actually like it, huh?  After a dozen, you're like, wow, Jesus, there's the cure for cancer.  Wow, and they're actually getting paid for this.  Hmm.  I listened a half dozen times, but then after the 13th time, I said, 
[02:22:30]  I got the cure for AIDS from that show.  I used to use cucumber skin.  I used to use cucumber skin.  Now I listen to you guys and boom.  That's the end.  All right, now we got to play another Arnold Schwarzenegger prank call.  How are you?  You didn't hear our intelligence during that Ted Demme interview?  My God.  Yes, we're on the decline.  I'll take a world on the decline any day of the week.  I love it.  The goddamn riots there in Cincinnati, I can't get enough footage of pandemonium in the streets. 
[02:23:00]  I was on CNN.  Well, a cop, a white cop shot a black guy who was unarmed, which, you know, of course, bad.  But I love the pandemonium that breaks out.  Because the black people figure, now I get me a Sony, you know, for some reason.  The outrage turns to free shopping.  So, they're out in the streets going crazy.  And I cannot get enough video of this happening.  And other people going, you know, trying to explain why they're looting. 
[02:23:30]  Where the cop thing going to take care of us, we going to take care of ourselves.  So that entitles you to a toaster oven?  That's a network in Hawaii.  Yeah.  Well, we're giving it away, people.  Just don't hurt down well.  Throw a rock to the window, people.  Let's go to Cesar.  Cesar, what's up?  What are you guys saying about Dylan, man?  We didn't say anything.  You know something.  All right, Cesar.  Holy mackerel. 
[02:24:00]  Cesar, are you listening?  Yes, I am.  I meet you guys every day.  We pretty much gave him a chance to hear any song in the world.  And he decided he needed to hear Dylan Like a Rolling Stone.  Yeah.  When you listen to this program, do you honestly think it's a place to sit and play some Bob Dylan?  No, it's not.  Right.  So why the hell would he think?  Well, I wouldn't mind listening to a little Dylan while you...  Hold on.  You can't curse.  Yeah, but Cesar, the point we're trying to make is he could have picked any song and he 
[02:24:30]  picked the one Dylan song that has been played like a million times on the radio.  Okay.  Thanks.  I screwed up.  I apologize.  And that's the whole point of this show.  We're trying to do things a little differently.  Instead of the same old, same old.  Oh, no.  I love your show, man.  Your show's the greatest.  Hail Cesar.  There he goes.  What happened to the empire?  Yeah.  Couldn't even hold an empire.  Jackal.  Once upon a time, you dressed up and threw the bones down in your pants. 
[02:25:00]  There he is.  Yeah.  That's what we need on this show.  Bobby?  Hey, you guys are going to play the Asian Arnold phone calls?  Which one was that one?  The one where he called the Asian lady.  That hysterical.  They're the best one.  Yeah, because she kind of hangs in there.  Do we have that one?  I know we played it once.  All right.  We'll try to find that.  We'll play the realty one and then we'll try to find the Asian one.  Okay, Bobby?  Okay.  Matt and Ralph on the tour bus rule, man.  Take it easy.  Opie, Matt and Ralph on the tour bus. 
[02:25:30]  They rule.  Oh, cool.  Nothing wrong with a little shout.  You look perplexed.  I wanted to just...  We'll be back.  Here's Arnold.  Welcome to the first realty.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Do this, Dave.  I'm Detective John Temple.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Temple.  Well, how about I come over here and I'll whoop your goddamn ass.  How about that sh**?  Yeah.  All right.  You son of a bitch. 
[02:26:00]  That's great, man.  Call me that.  You got a problem?  Get over here.  Otherwise, get off the phone and quit being an idiot.  But I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach.  All right, we hope I...  Britney Spears.  We don't play her music.  But we'd sure like to pin her legs back like a Tyson chicken.  Radio.  Gonzo style.  O.P. and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-WNEW. 
[02:26:30]  All right, we've got to break in here again.  You pissed off a couple people with your riot.  What?  Let's see.  Laquan.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Yo, I'm offended by the way you guys are talking about, you know, the riot, the black  man and all that.  Yeah?  This is such not a black guy.  I don't understand why.  Dude, dude, it's such not a black guy.  Let's see if John's a black guy.  John?  Yeah, hey, guys.  How's it going?  You're not a black guy.  I am.  Okay.  I'm 20. 
[02:27:00]  I'm black.  Trust me.  All right.  I'm sure you are.  All right.  I'm a big fan.  I've been listening since day one, and I wasn't even offended by the whole rioting spew.  Yeah.  I just had a quick question.  It's an honest question.  I might harp on you guys or anything.  But, Ann, are you really that racist of a guy?  Why?  Of what?  What do you mean?  Well, not based on the riot stuff, just on, like, you know, previous stuff, since, you  know, I've heard you talk about.  You seem to, I don't know, have a lot of animosity, I guess.  Haven't I ragged on just about everyone?  Right.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  You know, I'm just saying that sometimes it doesn't sound like you're really that jokingly 
[02:27:30]  about it.  You know what I mean?  What, about blacks?  Well, come up with an example, John.  Yeah, give me an example.  Um, I don't know.  Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of stuff you do say is true.  We impregnate way too many people and steal everything now that I think about it.  Here he goes.  All right.  You're not a black guy either.  You know.  Nice try.  I'm ringing the bell.  All right, John.  Earl, I want to apologize on behalf of, uh, well, nothing.  Okay.  Anthony, Victory Limousines.

[02:30:00]  If you missed Dice yesterday on the show, we're gonna play a few minutes of that tomorrow.  Dice is supposed to check in today.  It's kind of a little late.  Hopefully we can get through the rest of the show, but that's the call.  I guess he didn't need us today.  I guess, um, the Sheridan might not have a phone.  Is it the Sheridan?  No, Long Island.  Right off the Long Island Expressway?  Could be the Marriott.  Uniondale.  Either one.  Yeah.  Saman!  Yeah, what's up? 
[02:30:30]  Another fake black guy.  Fake black guy?  This is real, man.  You want me to bust a rap for you?  I could keep...  Bust a rhyme.  Check this out.  Okay.  Yo, don't be mad at me.  I don't love him.  I don't...  This is more than another one.  You had to see.  She keep calling me smooth.  And my name is Crazy.  She was all mine.  Oh, she was on your C, right?  That's what you're going to work at.  Oh, okay.  D-I-C.  Right.  Yeah.  You're editing yourself.  That's good.  Yeah.  I was keeping it clean for the radio.  I'm a radio guy, too, man.  Keeping it real.  Keeping it real.  I like what y'all do about the black people, man. 
[02:31:00]  Why?  What's that?  It's funny, man.  Why is it funny?  Y'all don't do enough of it, man.  It's funny.  I love the riot.  I love when you do the OJ, man.  Well, someone's got to explain...  That's popping off.  Someone's got to explain the riot thing to us.  That's popping off when you do the OJ, man.  Why, when you guys get mad, you wreck your own neighborhoods?  I just don't understand that.  I hate...  I don't understand that.  When I walk the streets, I see another black guy.  He comes up.  He wants to fight me.  Do what?  All right.  I don't fight him.  I don't care.  Thanks so much.  Nice rhyme. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Earl.  Yeah?  When your people get angry...  Seriously, why do they wreck their whole neighborhood?  I have no idea.  You really don't know?  No.  It doesn't make sense to me.  The whole L.A. riot thing, that was messed up.  Yeah.  It only made sense to me.  They're outraged by the shooting of an unarmed black man,  who, by the way, was running from the police at the time.  I say, white, black, yellow, whatever the hell it is, 
[02:32:00]  once you run from the cops, all bets are off.  You've got a weapon.  You don't have a weapon.  Once you start running, hey, now you took your life into your own hands.  Period.  There might be a cop a little itchy on the trigger finger.  You know?  Or he's running with his hand on his tongue.  Did he shoot the guy in the back?  I don't know.  Was it in the back?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But you don't know what he's saying?  Once you start running from the cops, all bets off.  You know, I was watching.  Igor from The Sopranos, the Russian mob guy, yes.  I was watching.  I think it was Extra today, right? 
[02:32:30]  And they said that if the pursuit exceeds a certain speed limit,  then the cops got to stop.  And they got to take the plate down.  I think this was on foot.  Oh.  Like they were chasing him down on foot.  Oh.  We're not talking one of those high-speed car chases.  I'm thinking, like, you know.  I don't think he can run until, oh, oh, this guy's booking.  Woo, those sneakers.  All right.  Calling up the pursuit.  No, but once you do that, that's it.  Sean.  That's why I hate when, like, people steal a car. 
[02:33:00]  And all of a sudden, the cops get a little rambunctious in the chase,  and the guy veers off the road and hits a pole, and he's dead.  Once you hit the gas, after you see the lights on there, all bets off.  Sean.  Yeah.  You're from Harlem?  Yeah, I'm from Harlem.  I'm from Uptown.  Okay.  Showtime at the Apollo.  We're waiting.  What's up, man?  I got a question.  Okay, why is this, why a guy could stand out in front of the White House, a white guy,  and only get shot in the leg, but a brother in front of his own house with a wallet, 
[02:33:30]  he gets gunned down with 41 shots?  Answer me that question.  That's a good question.  Is that because all cops, all they get to shoot at is, like, a black silhouette?  Is that it?  I say, because DC cops have bad aim.  Or do we all have, like, a Superman, like, ass on our chest?  Is that it?  DC cops have bad aim.  No, I'm saying the white guy should have been riddled with bullets.  In front of the White House.  Yeah.  In front of the White House.  You make a good point.  I mean, they got friggin' rocket launchers on the roof of the White House. 
[02:34:00]  They should have nailed them with one of those.  Thank you.  But if you got a wallet, you get gunned down.  Or if you ain't got no gun in your block, you get gunned down.  Well, the wallet looked like a gun, you know?  Oh, Jesus.  That's all I got to say.  Okay, I'm feeling it.  All right, y'all take it easy.  Why do people get so sensitive?  I don't think people understand how it is to talk to be a cop on the streets.  Right, and you do. 
[02:34:30]  Well, I'm...  Hold on.  What's up, Happy Face?  Hey, Happy Face.  You don't understand.  Dice.  What?  Hello?  What are you calling from?  Genie's Bottle?  No, I'm a friggin' idiot.  I'm in Brooklyn at the Golden Gate.  Hey, it's from my house.  What's that?  What's the Golden Gate?  It's a motel in Brooklyn.  And I'm talking to friends over here, and I realize it's after 6 o'clock. 
[02:35:00]  I got to get back.  I'm going to hit on this traffic.  I got to make the show.  Nice.  How are you going to make it to Westbury Music Fair from there?  I don't know.  Because the friggin' Happy Face over here said you got plenty of time.  No, you don't.  I got a shadow.  I got a shave.  I didn't do nothing.  Put on your superhero clothes.  Yeah, exactly.  I got to put on the, you know, the nine-foot pants.  You know what I mean?  You got the clothes on, Dice? 
[02:35:30]  Who's this?  It's Vanessa from Blue.  How you doing?  From where?  The girl that was sick at Blue.  Get the banana out of your mouth.  I can't understand you.  Oh.  Hold on.  The BS one.  But he don't have a head.  Oh, she said, I don't have a party girl, babe.  Because you said.  All right.  Come over there.  Thing close.  We all of a sudden eat somebody.  No, Dice, your phone sucks.  I know.  I'm on his phone phone.  You sound like you're in a clamshell.  And now it was stuck on the Belt Parkway with some hat in front of me. 
[02:36:00]  A hat?  You know what a hat is?  What's a hat?  A person of a 90.  All right.  A hat.  You know what I mean?  We call them blue dots.  Yeah, blue hair.  Blue hair.  Blue dots.  Yeah.  Blue hair.  Well, pass them.  I'm in a panic over here.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice, say the word.  What are you panicking?  Dice, say the word.  Right lane.  Say the word.  Right lane.  It never shuts up.  Dice.  What's going on there? 
[02:36:30]  Ugh.  Everything good?  Is he calling from like, uh...  I'm a little bit upset that you don't remember me.  Is he calling from the moment?  I'm supposed to remember you.  Yeah, you are.  You gave me your water.  I gave you water?  I had three cell phones in my hand.  You think that's your hand?  Dice, do you remember this chick?  Wait, where was she now?  Garden City Hotel.  Blue.  I wasn't feeling good.  Vanessa.  Andrew, right?  She puked on your handbag.  Oh, the girl that needed, uh, that was sick.  Yeah.  So what are you doing on the air, you little squab?  I'm feeling better. 
[02:37:00]  You told me to stop drinking.  Yeah, you should stop drinking.  You're sitting on the floor puking all over.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's all of your brand new shoes.  It's not bad.  I'm going, what's wrong with you?  Oh, I'm sick.  I've been drinking all day.  That's a way to build a life for yourself.  That's a filthy animal.  Exactly.  You're going to like that, Dice, right?  You're drinking everybody's water.  She wanted a drink from the mule already.  Listen, you offered.  Hey, Dice.  You know what I mean?  Dice, how are we going to get you to Westbury? 
[02:37:30]  How are you going to get on the air?  How are you going to get on the air?  I'm famous.  What's that?  What do you say?  Try to get a word in, Opie.  Try to get a word in.  Being as beautiful isn't easy.  I'm listening.  Try to get a word in edgewise, Opie.  I'm trying to listen.  All right, Dice.  Dice.  Shut up.  Okay.  Dice.  Shut up.  All right.  All right, now I'm not talking.  All right, now you talk.  Go ahead.  No.  You told me to shut up, so I'm shutting up.  You're sorry.  Somebody say something.  No. 
[02:38:00]  I'm not talking.  Why isn't anybody talking?  Because you talk for everyone else.  Why don't you come by?  We'll make you an extra party drink.  All right, Dice, how are you going to get to Westbury Music Fair?  I have no idea.  We're stuck in frigging traffic over here.  Well, describe the car.  I'm like having an anxiety attack.  I'm going to have to take the...  I'm dying over here.  I'm going to have to take something. 
[02:38:30]  We could get you like a police escort or something.  You don't understand.  I'm like in a sweat.  I feel like she didn't know the other night without the liquor.  Thank you.  Now, when's the show tonight?  Tonight?  Eight o'clock.  Oh, my God.  That'd be safe.  What time is it?  6.20.  It's a quarter after six.  Jesus Christ.  I haven't showered in four days.  Oh, I knew I smelled something.  Now, explain exactly where you are.  I'm on the boat parkway. 
[02:39:00]  We're passing like Starbridge City over here.  Oh, Starbridge City.  That's where my girlfriend is.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about.  Well, I'm just wondering if anyone sees...  What kind of car you guys got?  Limo?  No, no.  I'm not saying it.  Why?  We'll get you to Westbury.  We'll get you at this car.  No, no.  Because you're going to say the car, and I'm going to have problems.  No, you're not.  They're going to get out of your way.  No, no, no, no.  Who cares?  I just stick my head out the window.  Everybody will go, there's the legend, and I'll move out of the way. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Dice.  I know it and I'll hold the sign out the window saying legend coming through.  Dice, stick your head out the window with the cell phone.  Wait a minute.  He wants to say hello.  One sec.  Hey.  Hello?  Jim?  Yeah.  You've got to put up with this.  Yeah, this is...  We're on the dump parkway.  We're going to be late for the gig.  I'm panicking.  I've got to take a dump.  This is really driving me nuts.  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  What kind of car are you in?  A Mercedes.  A Mercedes.  What color Mercedes? 
[02:40:00]  What's that?  What color Mercedes?  Black.  What?  Black Mercedes?  Yeah.  And where are you?  On the dump parkway.  No, I know, but what part of it?  I think we passed Woodhaven Boulevard, but I'm not sure why.  All right.  Do you know the license plate of the car?  No, I don't know.  No?  Put your phone in there.  Hold on.  What's this dirty little slob that was at a club the other night doing in the studio?  That's what the guys just said to me.  She's diced.  First of all, not a club.  This is why I can't go out and slam these pigs around town. 
[02:40:30]  You weren't even close to it, sweetheart.  I didn't even know who the hell you were.  You see what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah, I know.  That's what you may believe.  You may believe.  In the meantime, now you're on O&A.  Listen, where's your friend with a cigarette?  I need one, all right?  I'm trying to be nice to you.  You were nice?  You were a filthy animal sitting there throwing up on yourself like a little filthy pig.  And I gave you water.  Take a shower.  Take a shower, you see?  Like you were on a desert island.  I helped you out.  Didn't I hear that you were bringing a joke eight years ago before? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, madam, I should have said my new right now, you lazy, thirsty animal.  Get a job instead of fucking bananas.  You're lucky I get a good sentence.  Oh, yeah, I think we passed Woodhaven Bullock.  I don't know exactly, but we're in awful traffic.  Everybody's yelling.  I really have to go to the bathroom.  All right, hold on one second.  Hold on.  Get rid of everyone except Blondie Seven, because people are starting to figure out which 
[02:41:30]  car dice isn't on the Bell Parkway.  Yeah.  Carlos.  Yeah.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Did you see dice?  You know what?  No, I don't.  But listen, don't worry about it, because the bell's opening up on Easttown anyway, so  he's in luck.  It's opening up?  Yeah.  All right.  Norton, you hear that?  Yeah, but I don't know.  We're not seeing it open up.  I hope it does, because this is brutal.  And I've got to go on first, and I've got to take the annoyance of the audience if we're  late, and I've been bugging everybody.  Let's go.  Watch out.  Look out. 
[02:42:00]  Look out.  No, this can only be too good.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep an erection with a little shouting going on?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No cursing.  What is Happy?  What is Happy doing?  What is he doing?  I'll put the legend back on the phone, because I really, the turtle is poking his head out  for me.  I'm very uncomfortable.  The legend.  Hold on.  All right.  Here.  No. 
[02:42:30]  I'm not.  Look.  Legend.  Not until you get goo lips off the rear air.  Goo lips?  I'm very aggravated now.  Oh, my.  Get light.  What's the problem with you?  I try to help a person out.  And you're dead.  You're not good for it.  And she's bashing your dice.  What happened?  She's bashing you.  I didn't even know who you were.  You knew exactly who I was.  I knew you were my little uncle.  That's why you came out with your little whore ass and sat right on the floor in front of  me and played the sick routine. 
[02:43:00]  9,000 people in the club were coming over.  Oh, it's the legend.  But you would have won.  What have you been living in a cave your whole life?  What do you have your face in somebody's mouth?  Listen, just come down to the floor tonight and buy some cigarettes off me and be quiet.  All right.  Maybe we got off to a bad start.  I'm sorry.  You know, that's what happens.  I'm aggravated.  We're on the Belt Parkway.  You know what I mean?  Maybe you're not even the girl I'm thinking about.  Hey, Dice, we have an officer on the line.  He's ready to help you.  You've got to tell us where you are, though. 
[02:43:30]  No, I'm not saying it.  Come on.  No, because any time I say them somewhere, you say it, and then there's a problem.  Well, let's see what happens.  Come on.  You know what you do, Opie.  Black Mercedes.  No, not a black Mercedes.  Black Mercedes with a guy wearing a Superman cape.  It's a four-and-a-half floor.  It's not a Mercedes.  Don't say nothing.  It's a black Mercedes, right?  Yes.  A car.  All right.  You know what I mean? 
[02:44:00]  And what exit are you near?  What's that?  We have a lot of listeners out there.  What exit are you near?  We're finding, like, what exit is this?  Where it, like, splits.  Where it splits.  What?  Yeah, where it looks like a girl's G-string creeping up her age.  You know what I'm talking about?  Is that the Southern State Parkway, Belt Parkway, Merge?  In Cross Island.  Yeah, that's it.  Something like that.  So, yeah, you're right around there?  You know what I mean?  I wonder why no one's talking around you right now.  It looked like the way that girl's pants did the other night when it creeped up her 
[02:44:30]  ass.  You loved it.  Yes, I was very lucky.  I like your whole attitude, Cinderella.  Turn up the hearing aid.  I like your whole attitude the way you walked with me.  All right.  I was so nice to you that night.  You were a little sick animal that I was trying to help.  All right.  Hold on.  You did.  I was asking if you were going to work out.  You had your gloves on.  I was the hero.  I was in my superhero jacket. 
[02:45:00]  And I came over.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got a cop on the line here.  Officer Mike.  Officer Mike.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Shut up.  All right.  Officer Mike.  Yeah.  They're right at the split from the cross island belt.  Oh, he's almost down at the Long Island already.  Oh, he's past the airport.  Yeah.  I'm too far back from there. 
[02:45:30]  Damn.  I can try to get fucking Highway 2 to catch up with him.  Get the Nassau County cops to make them take their clothes off and walk home.  They're good like that.  You're not good.  I'm really worried about making this gig.  Hey, Norton.  Hey, Dice.  What?  No, hey, Officer Mike.  Yeah.  Dice is wearing these really big pants with these really big pockets around his calves.  They're filled with drugs.  Oh, they're really bad.  It's got cocaine in the pocket that says kangaroo over it. 
[02:46:00]  Okay.  All right.  That's good.  Maybe we'll take a trip off to the parkway now.  APB on Dice.  On Dice.  Hey, Mike.  You coming from Sheepshead Bay?  Black Mercedes.  Black Mercedes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm carrying it now.  All right.  All right.  Take care of you guys.  Bye, Mike.  Bye.  Do you have any idea how bad it is if we get stopped?  What happens?  What?  This is going to be awful if we get stopped.  You won't get stopped.  You get an escort.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I would like a different type of escort. 
[02:46:30]  That would be really nice.  Hey, John.  Yo.  State Trooper.  What's up, John?  Can you hear me?  John?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Where is he?  Ant and I will give you whatever you want if you bust this car.  It's not your business.  Pull these guys over.  They're getting on the Southern State Parkway right by the belt.  Tell them to look to the right in about, I don't know, eight minutes.  That's not right.  Well, what's wrong?  That's not right.  I don't need your help.  Pull them over.  Full body cavity search.  Although Morton will like it.  I can only imagine.  Gee. 
[02:47:00]  If I get stopped by a cop, Opie, that's it.  If I get caught, there's going to be a problem.  I'm telling you that right now because I'll fight anybody.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to come out.  I'm just about.  I'm over here now.  I can barely hear you guys.  I think you're going to cut out.  All right.  Baby, may come.  All right, John.  If you see him, call him back.  Okay.  All right.  Call us back.  All right. 
[02:47:30]  Chickened out.  Chickened out.  That's what he did.  Joey.  Go touch him like this.  You know what I mean?  Punch Bob Hope right in his face if I saw you.  Joey.  Yeah, right here.  Hey, what's up?  Nine, dude.  Listen, I see Dice.  Okay.  You don't see him.  Dude, I see you.  You don't see him.  I see you, Dice.  I'm going to see you right now at 8 o'clock.  Okay?  I have my ticket.  I'm seeing you right now.  All right?  You got your ticket.  I'm over here now, because I'm not. 
[02:48:00]  I'm not.  Dude, I see.  Don't be asking.  You don't know me, Dice.  Stay up there, you Jew.  You bag.  You don't know me, Dice.  You're a punch.  I'm a punch.  You hear?  I'm digging holes for $5 an hour.  Don't talk to a legend like that.  Hey, happy face.  I'm thinking to you.  A legend.  A legend.  You're out the arena.  He's done.  You're going harder than you, buddy.  I got a goal.  You're the man.  No one.  You're the man, buddy.  No one. 
[02:48:30]  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  All right?  He's the star.  Happy face.  I will tell you where I'm getting.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Happy face is so obnoxious.  Happy face.  I'm the one with the haircut.  I'm the one with the good body.  I'm the one with the looks.  I'm the one that everybody wants to look at.  I'm the one that kisses dice his ass.  Not you, bud.  Go back to your job, man.  It's nice to people.  I'm a happy face.  I'm a happy face.  I'm a happy face.  Hey, happy face.  You're a diced kiss-ass.  You're a diced kiss-ass, happy face.

Why do you love me to stop changing our lipstick?  My penis looks like a rainbow.  That's a good one.  Do me a favor.  Go to your play house.  I'll slam it like this green door.  Delivers like a refrigerator.  The meat goes in and out.  You want me to keep this up, you bum?  You're a little wife.  We could all get a joke book, a happy face.  All right.  Well, tell you what.  We'll play house, sir. 
[02:49:30]  You beat a door and I'll slam you.  Do this.  Me hitting you.  You hitting the floor.  And promise, you will not get up.  You will not get up, you bum.  You're a little wife.  You should be a professional wrestler.  He's got a mouth on it.  All right.  I'll tell you what.  Tyson's feeding her minds out.  Let's play house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You did a nice job.  I'll move his knob and I'll screw her.  I'll turn her on.  All right.  How do you like that, you bum?  I'll take off your knees out and step on your face.  You don't talk to a legend like that.  Rick, do you have something on this? 
[02:50:00]  What's up, Rick?  Rick, what's up?  Excuse me?  You have something on this?  What's up, Rick?  The dead situation?  Yeah.  Did you hear a car honk or no?  No.  No cars honking whatsoever.  All right.  Yeah.  Because, I don't know.  I just think it's kind of weird that nobody can find them on the road and the roads are packed  with traffic?  Yeah.  I think.  I think they're at the club right now.  Ah, they just hung up.  How did he make it from Snarish City? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  In traffic.  Right now, I'm in Kansas.  Yeah.  They're at the club.  It's Dice trying to pull one of his wacky things.  Of course they're at the club.  All right.  We'll be back.  I know I'm a loser.  And Anthony.  I can't get as stiffy as my life's attended on.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Isn't that radio self-lacking?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:51:00]  107.  WNEW.  Anthony Sam Adams.  Yes, we love it.  Sam Adams.  Warm weather's here and the summer ale is back.  Yeah.  You gotta love the summer ale from Sam Adams.  I had the lager last night.  Yeah, that's all right.  I could hear.  Gee, I don't need...  There's 20 people talking.  I could still hear.  Pipe down!  Sam Adams.  Brewed with the grains of paradise.  An ancient brewing spice. 
[02:51:30]  Used to be an aphrodisiac.  Like a lot of people out there.  Something to roll over each other.  Jesus Christ.  It's like an orgy over there at the Jager table.  When you're drinking, Jager Meister,  have a Sam Adams to wash it down with.  That does go well.  You do a shot,  drink down with Sam.  We love it,  and we love Jim Cook and everybody at Sam Adams.  So when you're out,  wherever you're going over the weekend,  drink an ice-cold Sam,  a lager,  or a summer ale out now,  and enjoy,  because we do.  Sam Adams. 
[02:52:00]  The Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whores show.  By 7 o'clock,  I think you're gonna say,  you know what,  I had a pretty good time today.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O&H show.  I just had a red-headed slut.  Me too.  You know,  actually,  I am the red-headed slut. 
[02:52:30]  Everyone had a red-headed slut.  No,  no,  no,  I really am the red-headed slut.  I do it.  I promote Fiega in my spare time.  You do?  And I put on a red wig and a dress,  and I prance around bars from town to town.  Are you kidding?  No.  Ask that woman right there.  She witnesses with her own two eyes.  Igor from the Sopranos does that on the side?  On the side.  You're the red-headed slut.  I am the red-headed slut,  and they're proud of it.  Wait,  what does he do?  He walks around and entices customers  with his slutty ways  to drink the red-headed slut.  He's really great. 
[02:53:00]  They go down as easy as I do.  Don't you think guys are doing...  Hey,  that's a good line.  Don't you think  the guys will drink more of them  if a girl is...  No,  you know,  it's funny.  It's really weird  because guys love it.  They slap my hand,  they slap my hand.  Grab my handbag.  And girls,  the girls go wild.  They grab my nipples,  they kiss me.  It's kind of nice.  Oh,  yeah?  Thanks for everybody.  But we have the Jagerettes  working alongside him.  Yes,  yes.  We have the girls.  Where'd you come from? 
[02:53:30]  I don't know.  I know.  Who the hell are you?  That was a smooth transition.  Who the hell are you?  I noticed  because she had her clothes on.  No,  no,  you can come back by the mic.  She ran away,  Opie.  You scared her.  Have you been part  of the whole  naked bartender thing today?  I don't know,  really.  I have nothing to do.  No.  After they left,  she came in  with something else.  I thought she might be  the next shift  or something.  She actually,  she arranges  all the events.  I work with  the Jagerettes  in New York.  The Jagerettes. 
[02:54:00]  I thought we were  talking about Bacardi.  What happened?  They left.  Jagerettes.  I'm still talking  about Bacardi.  Now,  what is in  a red-headed slut?  It's a lovely  combination  of peach schnapps,  cranberry juice,  and Jagerester.  Woo!  Yeah,  and cat food.  That's good stuff.  You know,  I asked Ben  if he wanted one  and Ben goes,  oh,  I had a bad  experience with Jager.  Yeah,  and we breathe oxygen.  Who has?  Who doesn't have  a Jager story?  Can I tell Joe's? 
[02:54:30]  Go ahead.  I love a good  Jager story  because everyone's  got one.  Everyone's got one.  Go ahead, Bill.  What happened, Bill?  We were doing  a gig one night  and it was getting  late in the night.  Me and Joe  were doing Jager  all night.  Sure.  Things are going good.  This is down  in South Brentwood  and I see Joe.  He goes down  on his knees  and he's leaning back  and he's whipping  out this lead.  I'm like,  wow, man,  I never get to see  him do this,  you know?  At the end of the night,  I'm like,  hey, Joe,  man,  that was really cool,  man.  We're down on his knees  like that.  He's like,  brother,  it was the Jager myself.  You fell? 
[02:55:00]  I didn't do it  on first.  It was like  slow motion,  man.  He's like,  going down,  going down.  A controlled fall.  The block Jagermeister  did say it was  the best lead  he's ever seen  me do.  Bravo.  Yeah.  Oof, Jager.  Cool.  Red-headed slut.  Nice.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Igor's into  a little bit of everything.
