<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre intro featuring sound effects and Roland’s rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner."  The hosts immediately launched into a discussion of the Amy Fisher sex tape, graphically describing images from a newspaper.  Numerous calls followed from listeners in West Palm Beach and Chicago, expressing disappointment over the show's recent removal from their local stations.  A significant portion of the show was dominated by these listener reactions.

A major event occurred when program director "Tracy" stormed into the studio, angrily confronting Opie and Anthony about their handling of the station cancellations.  The ensuing confrontation, recounted with colorful language and sound effects, ended with Tracy's comically exaggerated departure.  The hosts then speculated on Tracy's motives and reactions.  Throughout this section, recurring segments like "Copperfield Tuesday," "Rock Scream Tuesday," and a $1000 caller contest were interspersed.  The discussion took a jarring turn with a humorous, irreverent conversation about the origins of AIDS, punctuated by listener calls and further banter about the program director incident.  The show continued to dwell on the station losses and concluded with more humorous commentary and sound effects.


The next segment started with a discussion of a Halloween prank on a news team, detailing the anchors’ terrified reactions to a staged "murder" scene.  Opie then shared a story about an encounter with an apparition that seemingly vanished through a wall.  The hosts engaged in playful bickering, referencing past conflicts with program directors, and attempted a call from Chicago that was interrupted by more arguing.  They returned to the news team prank, playing audio clips and discussing the anchors' responses.  A similar prank on Tom Brokaw was also mentioned, with an audio clip played.

E-Rock’s health concerns were then addressed.  He described experiencing unexplained numbness and other symptoms affecting half his upper body, prompting vulgar jokes and sexually suggestive remarks from the hosts as they speculated on possible diagnoses.  A $1000 contest winner was announced, followed by a darkly humorous discussion of a man charged with necrophilia.  The hosts then reacted with cynical humor to a news story about the killing of the world's oldest clam. They briefly touched on top-earning dead celebrities before a call from Freddie in Chicago provided an update on personnel changes at a local radio station.

A call from Karen in Jersey was cut short by more host banter.  The hosts briefly covered baseball news, including the Red Sox World Series win and Joe Girardi's appointment as Yankees manager, criticizing Alex Rodriguez and his agent.  A lengthy and contentious call with Marge from an animal shelter followed, filled with accusations, denials, and insults from both sides regarding allegations of mismanagement and unethical practices.  The hosts made several offensive comments, and Marge ended the call abruptly. The segment concluded with speculation about Marge's actions and continued jokes about E-Rock's health, suggesting his consumption habits as a possible cause.


The next segment began with the hosts announcing their transition to podcasting and diving into allegations of rape against David Copperfield, focusing on his private island and a voicemail inviting a woman there.  This led to a discussion of a man arrested for attempting to arrange sex with a corpse, prompting further discussion of necrophilia and related anecdotes.  A caller, Lori, a makeup artist, recounted witnessing a morgue intern performing a sex act on a corpse.  A "What Did We Learn" segment followed, with callers contributing off-color observations.  A graphic description of a naked picture of Danny Bonaduce ensued.

The show continued with more listener calls and tangents into sensational and offensive topics.  A prank call to a media conference with Matt Lauer, Ann Curry, and Al Roker, featuring highly vulgar language, was recounted in detail. The McCanns, parents of Madeleine McCann, were discussed, focusing on accusations of misusing funds intended for the search. The segment was filled with offensive jokes and comments about physical appearances and sexual acts.  The show concluded with Opie's top five women over 60 he'd have sex with, including more graphic commentary and offensive jokes targeting celebrities. Roland provided the musical outro.


The final segment started with a crude discussion ranking the attractiveness of actresses and celebrities, with sexually explicit comments about their age and perceived desirability.  The hosts then discussed a website dedicated to actors who played teenagers while significantly older.  The discussion shifted to a DJ's endurance record attempt, followed by more celebrity age speculation and sexually charged comments.  A call-in with Bill Donahue, a spokesperson for the Catholic League, ensued.  The discussion covered Britney Spears' controversial photos, criticisms of the Catholic Church, the conflict between the Church and the LGBTQ+ community, stem cell research, and the media's portrayal of religious figures.  The conversation ended with off-color banter, a song about a priest and an altar boy, and discussion of a gruesome, possibly faked video.  The segment concluded with a personal update from a host about their difficult relationship with their mother.


The last segment opened with a caller discussing his strained relationship with his mother and considering issuing her a list of conditions for reconciliation.  The hosts then engaged in a humorous, nonsensical segment brainstorming month names based on “Than’s” name.  A listener’s mishearing of a Bon Jovi lyric as "shaving off my muff" was discussed, with a guest from a Philadelphia radio show recounting unknowingly repeating the phrase on-air.  This transitioned to jokes about a chocolate Jesus figurine.

A significant portion involved reading "runner-up lines of the day," many of which were sexually explicit and vulgar jokes, often targeting E-Rock.  Jimmy Norton received a "Best Restraint of the Day" award, before the hosts resumed their crude humor.  The segment included several sexually explicit jokes and crude comments.  Sound clips were played, including one with the phrase "He's a fag," which was discussed regarding its removal. The show ended with additional crude jokes, teasing, and a listener's call about a sleep study.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1, 2, 1, 2.  Poe, Poe, Boo, Boe, Banana, Nana.  Banana, Fanna, Fo-Foe, Fee-Fi, MoMo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead? The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff.  And they just threw them in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants to get rock stars.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one, to feel his manhand  holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the nape of your neck.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, before we get the show on the road, we need Roland to sing The Star Spangled Banner.  Jose, can you see me?  Fives and stutterly lights.  For the ramparts we watch. 
[00:02:00]  With some gallantly gleaming.  And the rocket's red glare.  God's words were steam and air.  Gave proof to the light.  That a flag was still there.  Jose does that star spin the banner yet wave.  For the land of the free. 
[00:02:30]  And the home of the brave.  Play ball.  That's great.  Might as well start off today with a little patriotism like that.  Yeah, why not?  Roland singing The Star Spangled Banner.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Our phone number is...  Yes?  Our phone number is 877-212-ON-A.  Also, don't forget, onaradio.com.  Ah, that's it.  onaradio.com.  Just before the show, we were looking at the latest creation from Coke Logic.  Yeah.  He's animating, like, an ONA video, I think once a week, once every two weeks at this point.  Mm-hmm.  And the latest one with Anthony and his guns in his house. 
[00:03:30]  Very, very funny.  Yeah, it was the gun one.  It's right up there on onaradio.com if you want to check it out, all right?  Very funny.  How is everybody this morning?  Very good.  I want to see Amy Fisher naked so badly.  You want to see Amy Fisher naked?  Well, she's, uh, it says Cheeky Lolita Bears All, and, uh, she's in the paper today.  Uh, her, her alleged sex tape that's out there that her husband put out while they were on 
[00:04:00]  the fritz.  What a, what is.  That's a great thing to do if you're, uh, husband and wife and you have a little argument.  Yeah.  And then you just put out a, uh, you have a sex tape laying around you, ah, I'll show  her.  But this guy didn't even hesitate.  What a scumbie.  Now we got to call him a scumbie because you can't say, uh, you know.  Can't say skank bag.  Lawyers, lawyers don't like that.  Yeah.  Because that's how guys talk.  They say scumbie.  The new scumbie.  What a scumbie. 
[00:04:30]  It's guy talk.  What a douche be.  Yeah, that makes sense.  That's guy talk.  Uh, anyway, uh, yeah, so they get, uh, separated.  They're, they were heading for a little divorce action.  Yeah.  And Amy decided to go out with, uh, Joey Buttafuoco again, but that was all for TV.  It was a big publicity thing.  It was a huge publicity stunt.  So, he didn't even, like, uh, hesitate.  He, he had this video laying around.  He sold it to the Red Light District.  Yep. 
[00:05:00]  A porn distributor.  And the first few, uh, shots are in the paper today.  Yeah, a couple of stills.  One of her in a bathtub with a lot of bubbles and a little champagne, that looks like.  A little bubble bath.  Her leg is sticking out of the bathtub, covered in some suds.  She's got it, like, hanging over the edge of the bathtub.  And then some bubbles are removed where, where her breasts are, but, um, they blurted out for the newspaper, of course.  Then there's another one where she's, uh, putting makeup on in front of the mirror.  Yeah, but she's leaning over with lingerie on. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Putting on some mascara or something.  So, you kind of see some ass.  And then, uh, you see her, uh, her breasts in the mirror.  Sort of, like, it's, uh.  Sort of, with, you know, she's got lingerie on.  Oh, yeah, she's got some nice cleavage because she's got the big, uh, the big boobies.  She's got a, she's got a, uh, a breast job there.  She's got the boob job.  And then this one is, she's completely naked, obviously, leaning over, but, uh, they don't really show the, the nudity.  No.  Because it's a, it's a family paper, wink, wink. 
[00:06:00]  So, what's going on with this?  I guess, I guess it's too late.  Yeah.  Once it's out, it's out.  Well, then they got back together, uh, Amy.  Oops.  Amy and her, her husband.  And the guy's like.  Joey Buttafuoco, too, really.  That's who he is.  Looks like, uh, Joey.  Yeah.  And, uh, all of a sudden he had to go.  Um, I got something to tell you.  Uh, when we were separated there.  You know, you know the time.  I might have done something. 
[00:06:30]  When we were apart.  Do you remember when we were separated?  Remember that tape?  This is funny.  You're gonna, you're gonna laugh.  Remember that tape we made?  Yeah.  Oopsie.  Uh, well, I, uh, you know, we were separated for a weekend.  Yeah.  And I, uh.  I was, I was pretty, I was pretty angry.  I was pretty angry.  You can understand, right?  You were kind of seeing Joey.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  So I got a little mad.  And I, uh, I might have done something.  Well, what did you do?  Ah.  What did you do?  Meh.  I may, I, I, I, I, I might have, uh, sent the sex tape to a, uh, porn distributor.  What?  Yes.  So, I guess Amy's quote in the paper today saying that she's just gonna hide.  Is that what she's doing?  Just hiding out?  She knows there's nothing she could really do, so she says she's just gonna spend her  time in her house and hide. 
[00:07:30]  I know where, I know where she lives.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Ooh.  She lives near my mommy and Sal.  Down the street from your mother?  Yep.  Yeah.  Same little housing community.  Same little gated community.  Oh, it's gated?  Yeah.  You can't just go in there and look at her?  No.  No, you gotta, there's some, some bozo security guard all the time at the gate that never remembers  me.  Gotta go through this big security check.  It's like, yes.  And I give the name and everything.  And they have to call the house. 
[00:08:00]  And Sal goes, it's, it's Mar's son.  Let him in, Roe.  They did it again, Roe.  They're not letting me in.  Where's Joseph?  But isn't that exactly how you want to live?  Behind like gates and security guards and.  No.  That way there's no fun.  Why are you annoyed?  Then why have guns?  This sounds like nirvana for you.  Why have guns then?  I want it in the open where someone might bust in the door. 
[00:08:30]  Give me my shot.  You just want one shot, right?  Just give me the shot.  One lousy shot.  One shot.  That's all you look for.  One shot as someone's charging up those stairs.  That's all I want.  Yeah, I've passed by her house a few times, though.  Just looks like your normal suburban housewife and husband home.  There's little toys for the kids outside.  Nothing outstanding. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, she never really made any money.  No.  No, I mean, I mean.  She made a little here, a little there.  You know.  Not even as far as that, but you'd assume like there'd be some kind of, I don't know,  dark clout over the house the whole time or the news in front of it all the time or something,  but it's just, eh.  Nah, people are like every other place.  After a while, people just move on.  And then she is what she is, like just some hooah with a couple kids with a Joey lookalike.  The neighbor's wives do come out wearing Kevlar, but that's not the only difference.  I can imagine. 
[00:09:30]  So there you go.  In the paper today, there's a few shots of Amy in seductive wear.  They're rather risque.  They sure are risque.  And I love the post because they say, for more pictures from the video, go to our website.  It's amazing.  Everybody's like whoring their website and they know it will get you there.  Yeah, they're finally figuring out that that web thing is going to take off.  Yeah.  They finally have figured that out.  That the internets.  Yeah, let's say hi to Joey in Florida.  We got to get this over with.  Joey, what's up?  Joey!  I'm Bob.  What's up, man? 
[00:10:00]  Hey.  They took you guys off the air here, man.  Yeah, we say goodbye to West Palm Beach, Florida this morning.  Man, it's over, Johnny.  Oh, man.  I'm hurt, man.  I got an hour drive in and you guys have been lighting my light up for a while, man.  It's been a good time.  I appreciate it.  We light up your life.  Yeah, man.  Thank you.  You guys have been lighting up.  You guys got it, man.  I love you guys and I wish you the best and I hope somebody gets to find a way to get  back here.  Well, there's still many ways to listen to the Opie and Anthony show and what's really  weird, ratings came in yesterday and I believe we were fourth place men, 18 of 49 and we 
[00:10:30]  were second place men, 18 of 34.  We had a huge jump.  We had a huge jump in the ratings and I guess that wasn't good enough to save us.  No.  And I'm just laughing historically because this is completely ridiculous, but we were  replaced by some local show from Tallahassee, Florida.  So good luck to you in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Good luck to the...  Yeah.  In West Palm Beach, Florida.  We had a huge turnaround the last few months. 
[00:11:00]  We started trending up and the book came out and we had a really, really nice ratings book.  Yeah.  West Palm Beach, Florida.  Oh, well, start from scratch.  And, you know, our voices have to be heard because there's a lot of people out there that  are going to spin this crap, you know, in their favor.  So at least they get to hear our version.  They always spin it.  Look it up for yourself.  Six to nine, West Palm Beach, Florida on the buzz.  We were second men, 18 of 34. 
[00:11:30]  Lovely.  And that station is all about getting the younger male demos.  Can you guys hold for the next hour?  I would love to, but the phones are lit today there, Joey.  I'm sorry.  All right, man.  We'll see you again.  All right.  Delson, Philly, what's up?  Oh, man.  Philly misses you guys like crazy.  You have no idea.  Yeah.  We're still working on where we're going to be next in the Philly market.  So thank you, Delson.  I appreciate it.  He and S aren't doing it for me.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Well, good luck to you.  What can I tell you?  I, uh, uh, Alex in Chicago.  Alex, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Um, you guys are off in Chicago, man.  Well, we knew that was happening.  That sucks, dude.  I've been listening to you guys for five to six years, man.  You guys are the best.  Well, there's still other ways to listen to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, man.  All right.  All right, boys.  Thank you for everything, man.  All right. 
[00:12:30]  Thanks, man.  Uh, let's go to this.  I mean, we got to do a show, but, uh, look at the, look at these phones.  Michelle, Chicago, what's up?  Hey, I wake up an hour early.  I wake up at five in the morning just to listen to you guys.  Uh-oh.  Well, I'm just a little depressed today, but, you know, I know what I'm going to ask for  for Christmas, you know?  All right.  Why don't you?  Why don't you?  That's what he's out.  Ixnay.  Yeah, Ixnay on that, because they don't want to.  Oh, sorry.  Well, they dump out of those mentions for whatever reason.  I guess they're kind of scared of that. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know.  Whatever.  Why don't you go hit your snooze and do another hour?  All right.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Sam in Pennsylvania.  Sam, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Sam.  Hey, maybe you guys wouldn't get kicked off so many stations if you wouldn't have so many  intros, man.  With, like, 90-degree K-Rock, we're going through, like, the whole...  The old coming up next shortly, and then you got the old electric gold, then you got  Poe going poe, poe, poe, poe.  Now we have Roland singing the stupid Star Spangled Banner. 
[00:13:30]  Then we go into the music.  Man, I got to listen to, like, 10 minutes of intros for you guys.  Maybe he's got a point.  Our goal is to come up with a three-hour intro to the show.  And then just come on and go, thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  That was a hell of a show today.  Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.  Some of that stuff is not our fault.  Like, here in New York, they do, like, this filler thing, this production piece that's  filler, where it's just kind of Ant and I just babbling.  It's nonsense.  It's like clips of our show taken out of, you know, context. 
[00:14:00]  And it's just there to kind of fill so we could start the show on time for everybody.  Yeah.  So you got to take that out of the mix.  That has nothing to do with us.  I actually like that.  I actually like that production piece.  It's kind of trippy and cool, so.  All right, Sam.  I'll write down your complaint.  Less of an intro.  Less intro, more gooder.  All right.  Let's say hi to Pete.  What's up, Pete?  Hey, what's going on, Obi?  Hey, man.  What's up, Anthony?  Little Jimmy there?  Yeah, Jimmy's here. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, what's up, Jimmy?  You rule.  Thank you.  I'd just like to say you are off in West Palm Beach.  And thanks for nothing.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  It kind of hurts today, because I swear to you, the ratings.  I get an email that the ratings were really good in West Palm Beach.  And then I get another email.  I think it was the next email that came in saying that you're not going to be on West Palm Beach.  You're just done there.  That's terrible, because my wife and I, we've been listening to you guys since back in the  NEW days, and getting kicked off there. 
[00:15:00]  We moved down to Florida.  Everything stinks down here that's on the radio.  And then you boys pop up a year or so ago.  Yeah.  And then with the Philly debacle.  Now this.  Oh, gee, thanks.  We'll listen to Tropical Storm Noel.  Thanks for nothing.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, the road's a little rough right now, but we'll get some smooth ground soon, I'm sure.  Well, there are other alternatives to hear you, boys.  Yeah, in this day and age, there's still a lot of ways to listen to the Opie and Anthony 
[00:15:30]  show.  You guys keep kicking ass.  And we'll see you on the other side, I'm sure.  And hang tight.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, boys.  It's funny that the whole West Palm thing is over, because there was such a weird relationship  with those guys.  And then in the end, we were able to show that the show was working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now start all over again.  Have fun.  That's what doesn't make sense.  Just completely start over. 
[00:16:00]  Just have fun starting all over again.  Because no matter who you put in there, it's going to take a lot of time for the audience  to get to know them.  Yeah, you're never going to get this instant hit like that that can really have legs.  It takes a while to build an audience.  And once it's built, you've got a pretty nice, loyal audience.  But what are you going to do?  Seems like we had a lot of fans of West Palm Beach, because it's all West Palm Beach.  I know.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, look at that.  But I don't know.  Sorry. 
[00:16:30]  My management around here was paranoid that I was going to go off, you know, to start  the show.  Yeah.  Real paranoid.  Oh, God.  Don't spend the whole show talking about it.  Oh, Paul, you're so true.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Just please, for the love of God, make believe it's not happening.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  That's just bad radio when you go on the air and talk about losing a station or two.  Don't talk about it.  Oh, please don't talk about it, Lou. 
[00:17:00]  Lou-hoo-hoo.  Just shut up.  Just shut up.  Just shut up.  Figure out what song goes after a Red Hot Chili Pepper song.  Leave us alone.  We know what we're doing.  When you get phones lit with everyone wanting to talk about it, what are you supposed to  do as a talk show host?  Make believe it's not happening?  At least we get the facts out there that the ratings turned around drastically in West  Palm Beach, and then we get kicked off in the same day. 
[00:17:30]  You know how ridiculous that is?  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  And the Chicago thing, you know, we wish we had more time.  We really want to succeed in Chicago, but it wasn't happening.  And, you know, when they moved our shift to five to eight, it made it a little stranger  and whatever.  I'm not trying to make excuses.  The Chicago thing, we knew it was going to happen.  We were hoping we were going to hold on to West Palm because we knew the ratings were  going around.  Man that's worthwhile is the man who can smile when he gets booted from another radio station.  Okay, Pookie, pull the plug. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  We really don't want to replay the Philly thing.  Go off on the half hour, 40 minutes.  My God, that's not interesting to anybody.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Don't do that, please.  We want to save the cities that you're still on in.  This business stinks.  It just stinks. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  We got lots to do today.  This is the sound you're listening for to win one.  The sound you're listening?  $1,000.  Good morning to Buffalo.  Good morning to Syracuse.  Good afternoon to Cleveland.  Kind of good afternoon slash late morning to Washington.  Good morning to Boston.  We never say hi to Baton Rouge.  Baton Rouge.  Good morning.  Hi, Baton Rouge.  Good morning, Maine.  Hello, Tucson. 
[00:19:00]  Good afternoon, Rochester.  We on in Albuquerque.  I think we're on in Albuquerque.  Hi, Albuquerque.  Two in Michigan.  Hello, not Detroit.  Oh, don't say that, Jimmy.  Oh, I didn't mean to be negative.  I didn't mean to harp on it.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  I didn't mean to harp on it.  Sorry.  What are you doing, Lou?  People don't understand that stuff.  They didn't mean to harp on it.  There's barely passion left in radio, so God forbid we show a little every once in a while. 
[00:19:30]  What are you tools?  You're off a few stations.  How about a fresca?  Anyway.  I would listen very closely today if I was you.  You know what would make me feel better about the whole thing?  Some garlic butter sauce.  All right, yeah.  This is the sound you're listening for.  Garlic butter sauce.  Hope it's long enough, because that's another complaint we get. 
[00:20:00]  Some of these sounds aren't long enough.  Anyway, here's the sound you're listening for between 7 and 7.30 to win $1,000, courtesy of the Opie and Anthony show.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  That's what you're listening for.  When you hear that.  Garlic butter sauce cutting through your neck.  Saw.  When you hear that, be the 10th caller.  877-212-O-N-A.  And you're going to win $1,000, courtesy of us.  A cool G, I like to say.  Here it is one more time. 
[00:20:30]  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Saw.  Saw.  Hello, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Love the garlic butter sauce.  Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Shining out your new character?  Angry type in GM?  All the time we do is talk about losing stations.  Leave it longer.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  I have a question.  I don't know if you...  I'm trying to get furnishing for my apartment. 
[00:21:00]  Does an Oriental rug normally go with older people's stuff?  Or is that with younger people's stuff?  Oh, boy.  It depends on your whole decor.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  It was too modern, my crap.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Old lady-ish.  Oh, boy.  It is.  It probably would be.  Okay.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  Lots to do today.  It's Copperfield Tuesday.  What?  No, we got David Copperfield, and we got a fine voicemail of him, like, trying to pick  up chicks.  Trying to take him to Rape Island. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Welcome, everybody, to Rape Island.  And we got to make believe that the phones aren't lit with people from West Palm Beach,  Florida.  No.  Because that would be bad radio, right?  Rock Scream Tuesday.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  Hummer Tuesday.  And Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  All on the way with the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:22:00]  It's good to be alive.  Better mornings for some than others.  It's good to be alive.  Well, hold on a minute.  That was fun.  Another PD yelled at me.  Let me add it to the list.  Wow, this list is getting...  Whoa, I need a whole nother page.  I got scolded at.  Was that a scold or a scorn?  I think it was a scorn.  I'm trying to think of what that was. 
[00:22:30]  It was a bit...  It was a bit of an unhappy encounter.  I don't know what it was.  I thought they always just look at you.  They don't look at anybody else.  They always blame Opie.  Because they know I'm the problem.  All I heard was...  Okay, I'll leave then.  That's like...  That's pretty much what I heard.  I heard a little discussion going on.  Yeah.  And then something where it was... 
[00:23:00]  There was a little tension in the air.  And then I heard...  Fine.  Then I'll leave.  Oh, no.  Tracy said,  Opie, just leave me alone, please.  And Tracy said,  Fine, Opie.  I'll leave you alone.  I will leave you alone.  She was gone!  That was so uncomfortable, dude.  So uncomfortable. 
[00:23:30]  And then I'm like,  Hey, I'm not the only one on this radio show.  They always have to look at me.  Oh, they always have to look me in the eyes.  Yeah, I know.  I'm the problem.  I get it.  And then she did.  She did indeed leave.  And that was...  That was it.  She was not happy.  Nah, well, what are you going to do?  There was a lot of paranoia  that we were just going to spend the whole show 
[00:24:00]  talking about, you know,  losing West Palm Beach, Florida today.  And, um...  No, I mean...  But when you do a talk show  and you come in here  and the phones are lit with that,  what you do as a talk show host,  you take those calls  and hopefully make it entertaining  for everybody else listening.  Hopefully.  But you didn't like some of the things we said.  And she marched right in here,  sat there,  and gave me this evil, evil eye thing.  Yeah.  That's easy stuff.  There's a really... 
[00:24:30]  I'll tell you one thing  about the Opie and Anthony program.  Yes.  Over the years.  Yes.  It has never worked  to have a program director  come in during the show  at any time.  It just has never worked.  Sometimes it's more tolerable than others.  You get a hello.  That's fine, you know.  Hey, how you doing?  But when it's coming...  Anyone comes in to, like,  talk any type of business,  it's just never worked. 
[00:25:00]  No, because her whole thing  was to make sure  that we continue doing  an entertaining radio show.  I get that.  I get that.  So she didn't like the first break,  so she comes in here.  But then she...  It became personal  because we attacked her.  Indirectly, by the way.  But she got it,  which is...  She played right into my hands,  which is beautiful.  And then she sat down  to wreck the show.  To wreck the show.  No, think about it.  How does that help the show? 
[00:25:30]  Because now we're talking about it more,  and we were going to move on.  We truly were going to move on.  The first break,  we did a fine song from Roland.  We did the Amy Fisher stuff  a little bit, a little bit.  And then we took some phone calls  from our fine listeners.  And honestly, in our world,  we were sort of going to move on.  Maybe we'd hit on a little bit  here and there.  We'd pop up here and there  throughout the morning.  She comes in  because she was personally...  Her feelings were personally hurt.  Sat down there,  and now she wrecked this break.  So just stay out of the studio. 
[00:26:00]  We'll start the show at 7 today.  Am I right, or am I right?  I'd say you're right.  Yep.  See, I only gave you that choice.  This was...  That is true.  You had to choose,  and there was no other option.  Oh, was that uncomfortable.  It wasn't uncomfortable.  Yeah, it was kind of enjoyable.  A little bit uncomfortable.  This all started  because after the show,  she was outside smoking,  and she grabbed me and said,  look, I hope we're not going to have  a repeat of the Philly thing. 
[00:26:30]  But the Philly thing was different.  And I'm looking at her like,  you're supposed to be  someone in the know  that knows the show  and knows our markets and stuff.  And if you don't understand  that there's a drastic difference  between what happened to us in Philly  and losing Chicago  and West Palm Beach,  then I don't have time for you.  I really don't.  The Philly thing  was a massive kick to the groin.  Massive.  Chicago, we knew we were losing.  At West Palm Beach,  we knew we were losing.  And so it was completely different. 
[00:27:00]  But when we lost Philly,  it hurt so much  and it was so frustrating  that, yeah, we went off.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But we weren't going to do  the same thing today.  So for her to sit there  and as soon as I leave the building,  get in my face about,  I hope we're not going to be doing  the same thing we did  when you lost Philly.  I'm like, what?  And then to sit down.  Do you honestly know the difference?  The phones were loaded  with only callers  that wanted to talk about  why we weren't on  in West Palm in Chicago.  So we addressed it. 
[00:27:30]  We didn't do any bashing or anything.  It was just addressing  what was happening.  The show's always been honest  about those kind of things.  And then, yeah,  when a PD comes in  and sits down  and give you a little talking to  when you're on the air  for 15, 20 minutes  and you have an entire day to go.  I don't know how that helps you.  Doesn't really help.  And she knows that  because it got personal  and she needed to, you know,  to react to that.  Yeah.  You know, which is bad, 
[00:28:00]  bad PD-ing.  Not good.  Not good on that one.  It's just bad caddying.  Yeah, there was some very funny  pet night impressions  in that picture.  Okay, PD, leave the studio.  All we care about is Maine.  New York and Maine.  Those are the stations  that we care about.  She knows it.  That's right.  It's how do we sell.  We're doing a road trip to Maine.  We're all going to do 
[00:28:30]  a little lobster things.  Then talk about motion.  Motion.  We like motion.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, maybe we'll sink  into the Carol Miller tapes today.  This might be a perfect day for that.  Yeah.  We can talk about that debacle.  But, guys, let's not keep it negative.  That's the problem.  Let's keep it upbeat.  A study today said the AIDS virus  invaded the U.S. from Haiti.  Haiti? 
[00:29:00]  In 1969, it was one guy  that brought it to this fine country of ours.  One guy.  One guy in 1969.  How do they figure that crap out?  I have no idea  how they traced that back.  I can only not believe it.  That's the only thing I can do  is go,  someone made this up.  How the hell are you supposed  to track down the one guy?  And who was he?  Give me a name.  I'm looking right now.  I don't know.  It said this guy,  University of Arizona  evolutionary biologist. 
[00:29:30]  He said the timeline was laid out.  It said that 1969  is when it came here.  And it's 12 years before AIDS  was first recognized by scientists.  in 81.  That's a lot of stuff going on  12 years before you recognize it.  One Haitian.  What a busybody he must have been.  Wow.  What a good-looking fella.  Good-looking fella.  Something tells me  he was probably  maybe  not  of the heterosexual. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know, man.  Well, no,  because it picked up so quickly  in the gay community,  as everybody says.  Oh, so he came over.  I don't think AIDS  is a gay disease.  No, of course it isn't.  I think it started  because you ate  some monkey brains  or something.  But you got it.  Well, I don't think  he came over  with some  Del Monte monkey brains  in his luggage  from Haiti.  This is my theory.  He ate some monkey brains  back there in Haiti,  came to America,  and his sexual preference 
[00:30:30]  was such that,  there you go.  No.  I think he came over here  as a gay gentleman,  and it spread amongst  the gay community.  Yeah.  And the Haitian community,  if you remember,  when it first really kicked in,  it was amongst  a lot of Haitians.  So he was probably  amongst Haitians  because he's from Haiti  and to the gay community  because it's spread  a lot quicker that way  through gay sex 
[00:31:00]  than it is,  unprotected gay sex,  than it is through  protected or unprotected  heterosex.  Yeah.  I know these things.  I studied.  It was from,  they think,  Central Africa from 66.  1966?  Yeah, and then he came  to the U.S. from Haiti  in 69.  That's where the monkey  comes in.  Yeah, he's from Africa.  Someone had sex  with those little green  tree monkeys.  And, yeah,  you ever see them?  They're like a fluorescent green.  They're kind of small,  though, aren't they?  Yes, they are. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  Snug is the word  you're looking for, Oop.  Snug.  And they're petite,  I like to say.  And they're fluorescent green  because they got the AIDS.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  It makes you glow.  Something happened.  Some guy had to pick  some poor monkey  who's sitting there going,  oh, do I got a stomach ache.  Oh, I just want to hang  on my tree.  I don't feel too good to you.  Oh, my God.  What's he doing to me?  What is this idiot  doing to me?  Oh, no.  Now what does he want  me to do to him?  Oh, geez.  Well, I hope you get  a tummy ache. 
[00:32:00]  And he certainly did.  66.  Yep.  That's a long time  when then you figure  it was the mid-80s  before it really, like,  took off.  Caught on.  So there's a disease  out there right now  that's going to take another.  Oh, just lurking.  Just lurking.  I hope it's like  something Uber.  Yeah.  Something huge.  Give us Captain Trips  like from The Stand.  That's what we need.  A good disease  like from the Stephen King book,  The Stand,  where only a few make it.  Of course, I'll be one. 
[00:32:30]  Well, you got your car.  They need me.  I don't remember The Stand,  although I remember  I didn't like,  I like the book,  but I didn't like  the name of the guy  called Walking Dude.  What are you doing?  What's not a good name  for a character?  Especially Satan.  The devil's imp.  Let's say hi to Dave in Philly.  Dave, what's up?  Dave.  How's it going?  Hi, Dave.  Hey.  Hey, Obi,  did you just say  that AIDS makes you glow?  Yeah.  Yes.  AIDS makes you glow green, sir.  It was pregnancy. 
[00:33:00]  Well, no,  the green monkey  had the AIDS,  but it was really bright green  because it had the AIDS.  Oh, it's such a lovely thing.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't these  program directors understand  that we care  what you talk about?  I don't care if you're  talking about any city.  It matters to us.  Well, it's a challenge.  I understand, like,  some of this stuff  might be local to Philly  or local to West Palm Beach,  but it's our jobs  to try to make it  interesting for everybody.  I like to think  We're local to Earth.  Yeah, and we feel  at most of the times 
[00:33:30]  we do just that.  We make it interesting  for everybody.  I don't like to think it.  Yeah.  I don't think of it.  Well, yeah.  I like to do it.  If you don't understand,  Obi, you cannot ruin the show.  AIDS monkey.  What happened?  You're not putting up pictures.  That's the AIDS monkey.  That's the AIDS monkey.  That's the one.  They are cute.  They are adorable.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks.  That was their defense  against all these people  that would take tours  and then just grab them  out of the trees.  Like, all right,  we got something for you. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, here's a little treat  to take back with you.  Have a safe flight.  The monkeys had enough  sleeping on their stomachs.  That's just creepy  that they figured out  it came here in 1969, though.  Summer of Love.  No, that was 67.  67.  69.  Maybe the monkey  was at Woodstock or something.  Free love.  Well, we'd like to go  to the phones, but you know.  Oh, let's just take  a random caller.  All righty, Jimmy. 
[00:34:30]  Jennifer, Port St. Lucie.  What's up, Jennifer?  I think West Palm  has just been pumped.  Don't talk about it.  What do you mean?  We don't know  what you're talking about.  Don't talk about West Palm.  I'm now winning  that caddy tournament.  Now, that's important.  Sit down, Opie.  This might affect  our status in Maine.  Better be careful here.  Let's say hi to Chris in...  Oh, West Palm Beach, Florida. 
[00:35:00]  What do you got?  What do I have to say?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I'm a former New Yorker.  I got a...  This is how long  I've been listening to you.  I got a WoW sticker  that was one of the  Klingon window things.  Oh, boy.  Klingons.  Yeah, the window clank.  Different from a Klingon.  Yeah.  I got the Romulan sticker.  That's how long  I've been listening,  but I'll just say  I got another way  to listen to you guys,  so...  Alrighty.  ...get on local down here,  but we love you  and we miss you.  Yeah, we want to continue  on commercial radio, 
[00:35:30]  that's for sure.  Thank you, sir.  Here's the next call  from West Palm.  Well, we're waiting.  Sorry.  Because it was also brought up,  how does it help  to trash regular radio,  and we try not to do that,  to be honest with you.  There's an article  that came out Friday.  FMQB.  It says it all.  Yeah.  We love being on  commercial radio,  and I think we make that point  by showing our passion  when we lose these stations  how much we want to  be on regular radio.  Vince, Chicago,  what's up? 
[00:36:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to call  and say that I'm really  going to miss you guys  in Chicago.  I think the guys  that filled in for you  as you will be sad to hear  is John and Jeff.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't have it  any other way, sir.  Thank goodness.  Pretty pathetic.  As soon as I heard that,  I just...  Nah, no.  My local college radio station,  you know,  at least they play  decent music on there.  What I did want to say was...  Don't tell me that  John and Jeff  continue to haunt us. 
[00:36:30]  No, they're not helping you.  But what I wanted to say  was that I'm actually  one of your...  I run a site on MySpace.  It's an official  straight pride flag.  Okay.  And I'm one of your friends  on your MySpace.  Okay.  If you guys want to send me  any kind of links  as to where people  can hear you  in Chicago,  you know,  after the radio station  is off,  you know,  without, you know,  purchasing like XM  or something like that,  I'd be more than happy  to help, you know,  promote you guys  as much as possible.  Well, we're...  You know,  you can hear us 
[00:37:00]  on the internet as well.  You know that.  Yeah,  the guy who went  to the phone  said it was,  I believe it was  audible.com,  so I'll be making sure  to add that to my page  as soon as I get home today.  Yeah,  that has a lot of old shows,  but, you know,  that internet thing,  you know,  when they figure out  how to put a huge computer  in your car.  A supercomputer.  I think we're going to  take off on the internet.  Let's say hi  to Karen in Chicago.  Best of stuff. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  I guess if you search around,  just put our names  in a search engine,  you'll see a lot of fun stuff.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Gabe  in Philly.  Gabe,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  You have gay in your name. 
[00:38:00]  Huh?  Hey, listen.  Hey,  I got a suggestion  for all the program directors.  Yeah.  We played a taste testing game  with the AIDS monkey.  There you go, Gabe.  Linger!  Linger longer,  my friend.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kathy in Boston.  Kathy, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted the PD  to know that you have  to talk about West Palm Beach  and you have to talk 
[00:38:30]  about Chicago  and you have to talk  about every place  that you've been  because if you care  about them,  that means you care  about us.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's adorable, Kathy.  Thank you.  It more translates, though,  into that we care about us.  Kathy listening on  that fine station  called BCN.  Yes.  Exactly.  BCN.com,  you can stream it live.  All right.  Thank you, Kathy.  All right, Kathy.  Well, I want to thank Tracy  for getting the phones  to continue to run. 
[00:39:00]  On fire.  They're just on fire today.  Who's not,  who's turning the show off today?  This could be the day  we blow it all up.  You never know.  You never know.  Every ding-dong day.  Hey,  here's the sound  you're listening for  between 7 and 7.30.  Oh, good.  I love hearing this.  I mean,  we got so many people  checking us out right now.  Not yet.  You can't call yet,  but this is what  you're listening for  starting at 7.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  And when you hear that,  be the 10th caller  at 877-212-O&A. 
[00:39:30]  That's always funny now.  Yeah.  And you will win $1,000.  Awful editing.  Yeah,  what happened  to the S?  The sauce.  What happened,  Iraq?  Guy probably was talking,  so when I edited  in that little 360 thing,  I cut it off.  It was the beginning  of you suck.  Leave off the last S  for simpleton.  Like the garlic butter,  so you suck.  Let me just get rid of that.  They'll understand  what garlic butter sauce is. 
[00:40:00]  By the way,  Scott M.  from Hop Hog,  you know,  he wants you to do  more Caddyshack lines,  even though he's not  from West Palm Beach.  Ah!  Oh!  Ha ha!  Oh, yay!  He wants you to do,  uh,  I want Chicago!  No, I want West Palm Beach!  I want Philly!  I want...  You'll get nothing  and like it!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  I'll see you in your office  to be yelled at, 
[00:40:30]  Senator!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Do you know what  PDs can do  to a radio show?  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  I want you to go out  and kill all the PDs  on the golf course.  Ha ha ha ha!  But check me on this, Sandy.  If I kill all the PDs,  they'll lock me up for sure.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Yes, but it's a good thing.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha! 
[00:41:00]  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Is it wrong that when she sat down and started talking, I wanted to run like Spalding and  put my head in the roof of a car?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You were kind of uncomfortable, huh, Jimmy?  I know.  I wanted to say something.  I just didn't feel it was my place because she wasn't looking at me.  Yeah, great.  But I certainly would've.  I think I was the only one in the room, according to her, for some reason.  It was like a lover's quarrel almost.  She was scorned.  It was a spat.  Yeah, a spat's better.  A spat.  Hey, it's Freedom. 
[00:41:30]  Hey.  That's your real name?  That's my real name.  Wow, cool.  Your parents are kind of hippies, right?  Yeah, they were hippies, but I was born the day the hostages were set free from Iran.  1981.  81?  That seemed like a good idea at the time.  I'm gonna call my kid Challenger.  Like, you just see that happening.  Girl, what's your name?  Challenger?  Yes, I know.  Special endeavor.  I'm gonna call my kid Hammer. 
[00:42:00]  As an emcee.  Yeah, man.  Wait, we can do this bit if you get what happened in 81 there, Iraq.  Let's go.  Wait, miss, your parents were hostages?  Or your dad?  No, I was born the day the hostages were set free from Iran.  Yeah, so are a bunch of people.  What the hell is-  That's your name.  Well, I can understand, yeah, if maybe a relative was imprisoned by the Iranians.  For the first-  Yeah, you know, you're right.  My mom was a hippie.  For the first six months, your parents had to explain, like, we're calling her freedom. 
[00:42:30]  People were like, freedom.  Wow.  Wow, that is so cool.  Then it just worked out that I was born the day the hostages were set free from Iran.  All right.  Okay, baby Jessica.  I know.  I bet you there's a lot of Saddam's being born right around here.  Saddam's?  Yeah, right when they snapped his neck, I was born, and wow, they decided to call me Saddam.  Your name just as easily could have been Time To Go.  Or Finally A Burger.  What's that? 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Thanks for that.  That's a silly name, but-  But why did you call?  Well, I called because I wanted to see what you thought about your Maine listeners.  We love our Maine fans.  Yeah.  Freedom.  And all kinds of lobstermen and fishermen that listen to you guys on our call.  Yes.  Hey, listen.  The Pope got shot.  We really appreciate you calling.  All right.  Thanks a lot, honey.  Oh, no.  She's leaving.  No, we like Maine.  Don't know much about it, but-  The Pope got shot.  I skied at-  All right. 
[00:43:30]  Well, we like you, too.  I'll talk to you later.  I skied at Sunday River.  Once.  Mmm.  You did?  Yeah.  Well, where do you live now?  When do you-  Where's your nearest show?  Are you gonna do anything?  What are you asking at?  No, hold on, John Hinckley.  I'm just trying to ask a question.  God almighty.  How's your grandmother owe the humanity?  Yeah.  Hey, James Brady's speech pattern.  Oh, my God.  I've heard it all. 
[00:44:00]  I bet you haven't.  Do you like my name, though?  Huh?  Do you like my name?  If you saw me, you'd like my name.  Ah, yes, we like your name, Sadat.  Why do you-  So, someday, when you see Freedom's Jewelry, because I make jewelry-  Yeah.  Then you'll say, oh, I made fun of this girl.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That's nice.  What kind of jewelry does someone named Freedom Make?  Yes.  Um, really hand-crafted, nice, fine jewelry.  Do you have your aunt live in infamy working with you? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, actually.  I have my mother working with me.  Hey, Walter Cronkite retiring.  Where do you live?  Hello?  Throw another one at me.  I'm ready.  Yeah?  You're barely ready.  Okay, Ted Offensive.  In 81?  I'm just throwing out every year.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Hold on, DJ.  We're talking about something.  Let's just keep going back.  I don't care.  Yeah, hey, aid services for the first time. 
[00:45:00]  We're trying to get to the bottom of something.  Oh, my God.  Well, thank you for talking to me for this long.  All right.  Thank you.  Longer if I didn't have a guy with horse hooves typing in things and put them up on  the screen.  That record rate.  He's got garlic butter on his hands or something.  E-Rock, you type like five words a minute?  We've got to give you a typing test.  No, I type longer than that.  I emailed you.  Not you, Freedom.  Not you, Freedom.  Not you, Freedom. 
[00:45:30]  We're talking about E-Rock and his hooves.  Yes.  I'm trying to type.  Hey.  All right.  Thank you, Freedom.  Devil's feet over here typing.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We're getting ready to give away another $1,000.  For great-grandfather, iceberg dead ahead.  But we just teased.  I mean, it was nice to have the Japanese surrendered to call in. 
[00:46:00]  Now I'm scared to go to break.  What's waiting behind that door now?  Oh, boy.  Hopefully some food.  Yeah?  Hungry.  Oh, that would be a nice surprise.  It's nothing, uh...  Maybe it's something nice.  Maybe it's a...  Maybe it's a...  A bundt cake.  Nothing we have to worry about, I hope.  Maybe it's balloons.  Like, hey, we'll be, uh, right...  Ah!  No!  We're not even off yet!  So when we get back, we'll be...  Ah! 
[00:46:30]  What did we do now?!  I will leave you alone, Opie.  Yeah, that was pretty traumatic.  I'll leave you...  You want to be left alone, punk?  Oh, I will leave you alone.  Ah!  Most people in radio have forgotten that this is all just fun.  It's supposed to be.  There's so much business in it.  But in this room, the room with the microphones...  Yeah.  That's where the fun product is made. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  That's where the product of fun is pumped out of the fun factory we call the studio microphones.  The conveyor belt is moving nicely today.  The business of it.  With nothing but fun coming through.  Exactly.  You go to any other place that makes fun or something delicious like chocolate, and there's...  And there's...  It's not...  It's not business people moseying about in there.  It's the fun people.  You know what we do?  We package and sell fun.  That's right. 
[00:47:30]  And good tidings.  A heaping helping.  Every day.  Scott in Japan.  If I had a baby today in Chicago, I would name him Nothing's on the Radio.  There you go.  There you go.  It's just fun in here.  I hear you now.  I just can't stay inside all day.  Everybody.  I gotta get out.  Give me some of those rays.  Everybody's smiling.  It's a sunshine day. 
[00:48:00]  It's a sunshine day in here.  It's a sunshine day.  Not an old doom and gloom out the door.  Her feet didn't even move.  She just floated out.  We're going to go for a walk outside.  Yeah!  He's gone.  Gotta get out.  Gotta get out.  Gotta get out.  Gotta get out.  Alright, OP.  You want me to leave?  I'll leave.  I'll f***ing leave. 
[00:48:30]  Huh?  You want me to leave?  You got it, punk.  I'll f***ing leave right now.  Oh, I'll leave you alone.  She didn't even leave.  All of a sudden I looked and she collapsed like Oldman and Dracula.  And there was a bunch of rats just running out.  Hold that.  Hold that. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, god damn, man.  Oh, you've never seen someone leave like this before.  No.  Never.  Let me climb out of here. 
[00:49:30]  Sorry, I just had to play the yodel sound.  I love the stupid yodel.  As she was leaving, I was going, $50?  You kept going.  $70?  $70.  $70.  I'm going to be leaving now.  Oh, no.  But this isn't over by a long shot.  Non-threatening way to leave, but okay. 
[00:50:00]  It's a happy way to leave.  Here, do her one.  You got a...  Hold on.  All right, get ready to do your line.  I'm jumping in on this one.  Yeah?  Yeah, but I can't do the voice, so you do the voice.  All right.  All right.  Confrontation going on, blah, blah, blah.  Me and her, me and her, me and her.  No one else in the room.  Me and her, me and her.  Just leave me alone.  Oh, you want me to leave?  I'll leave. 
[00:50:30]  Whoa, look at her going fast motion.  Wait, wait, she's not leaving.  She's running around the console.  Oh, my God.  But she jumped up on the console, and now she's just jumping in fast motion.  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Look how fast her finger's shaking at Opie.  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Her dress is bouncing.  She's patting a little old man on her head.  She went to leave, but went into the bathroom.  All right, she's back out.  Now there are big busted nurses following her. 
[00:51:00]  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  A police officer's blowing a whistle at her and shaking a bobby stick.  How is that possible?  We're in America.  Oh, I wish I had my whistle.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Contest's on.  Between now and 7.30, you've got a chance to win $1,000.  Keep listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  There's a running theme on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:51:30]  It's creepy.  We have pissed off another PD.  I thought I was going to go talk to her, but I looked in her office and she was hanging  upside down from the rafters, sleeping.  Hanging upside down, smoking a cigarette. 
[00:52:00]  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Smoke, smoke, smoke.  Wait, we actually have audio of her?  We have audio of her.  Walking down the hallway?  Walking toward the studio.  Oh, no.  In a nurse's outfit.  I'm going to patch over one eye. 
[00:52:30]  Kill Bill, anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Anyone?  At least we're getting more sounds on the radio show, right?  Kill Bill was good.  I didn't like it at first.  It grows on you, that movie.  And then it just was really good.  I saw...  That goddamn Michael Parks is so good in Quentin Tarantino movies.  He's...  He's...  He played the sheriff guy. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I remember.  He was also in Dusk Till Dawn.  He played the cop that was in the place initially where they had taken the hostages.  And the guy behind the counter wasn't supposed to let on to the fact that George Clooney and  Quentin Tarantino were in the back room holding a couple of girls hostage.  It was so good.  He's just sitting there talking.  Yeah, giving that delivery.  Just a great, great actor.  Another one that Quentin Tarantino just finds from the past. 
[00:53:30]  He's good at that.  Yes, he is.  And whoever does the music in Tarantino's films is the best.  Yeah.  Whoever grabs his songs.  Just finding all that stuff that is...  What?  Old, yeah, music and old surfer music.  Stuff that should have been on the radio.  Right?  Yeah.  You're like, wow, why wasn't this ever played on the radio?  Cool stuff.  Hey, it's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  What do you little maniacs like to do first?  Let's say, it's New Wave Tuesday.  But she blinded to a science science. 
[00:54:00]  Science!  She blinded me with science.  Oh, s***.  And she failed in biology.  Bueller.  Bueller.  Shoot that poison arrow to my heart.  Shoot that poison arrow.  Shoot that poison arrow to my heart.  Shoot that poison arrow.  Do you take drugs, Danny?  Every day.  Good.  Who can it be now?  Who can it be now? 
[00:54:30]  A dope.  Who can it be now?  Who can it be now?  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  On the LB and Anthony show.  Boys.  You just want to hit them.  But every week, it's those three guys fighting it out.  This week's star, Club Soda Candy.  I've got to give it to Candy over Roland and Steve.  Steve?  What do we call him?  Gentlemen, yes.  Huh?  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  We call him Steve on this show?  Yeah.  He was called other things on other shows.  But there you go.  We give it to Candy today.  Hey, we got your video clip of the day.  This should be up on onaradio.com later on today when Stephen S. from Bayshore does the  show rundown.  But this is great, man.  The news is live.  And they decided to scare the crap out of the anchors for Halloween.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  And this is how it went down.  609 is the time. 
[00:55:30]  We love emails.  Good morning at news10.net.  It sounds like people are being murdered.  What a great idea, though, man.  You had the four people at the desk.  Yeah.  At the anchor desk.  I guess, you know, whatever.  The entertainment person, the weather person, the sports, and the anchor.  And they're all sitting there ready to get into their little chit chat.  And two people come running onto the set with horrible masks on and covered in some kind 
[00:56:00]  of fake blood.  And one of them holding a knife, chasing the other one.  And they went running toward the desk.  And they went around back.  And the women just started screaming bloody murder.  One of them falls off her chair.  The look of horror on her face didn't go away.  Like, the guy kind of knew really quick what had happened.  And he put his head in his hand and started kind of laughing.  But this one woman was completely horrified. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  It sounds like a murder scene.  And why does that continue to horrify people, the scary masks?  It's just surprise scares people.  The real maniac is coming at you.  And they're going to look just like you and I.  Yeah.  You know something?  I don't even need, like, somebody to jump out and go boo sometimes.  Did you ever just turn around and someone's looking at you?  And you go,  Ah, well, happened about an hour ago.  The apparition.  She showed up.  Funny you should say that, Anthony. 
[00:57:00]  You want me to leave?  You know who she looked like?  No, he was.  I said, leave me alone.  You're missing the line.  She goes, oh, I will leave you alone.  I'll leave you alone.  You don't get my knowledge anymore.  Like X-Men.  She just disappears through the wall.  I'll leave you alone, Opie.  And then she crawled back into the TV like the girl from The Ring.  Sorry this is inside for a lot of people, but it's making us laugh today. 
[00:57:30]  It's hysterical.  Here's the headline.  I pissed off another PD.  And here we go.  All right, so you got the news.  You got all four at the anchor desk.  You got the news.  I'll be back.  Oh, really?  Will you?  I'll be back.  Yes.  Stop whining.  I'll be back.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we just want to address it a little.  Stop it. 
[00:58:00]  All we want to do is, because we're getting a lot of phone.  Quiet.  Can't we just take a call from Chicago?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Why don't you leave us alone?  I'll be back.  Oh, boy.  That's never good, right?  What do you think of the show so far?  It's sex. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  Oh, it was hilarious.  I'm the potty pooper.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  Could be said.  Oh, she was hot under the collar.  Just a bit.  She danced out of here like riffraff in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  She time warped out the door.  Hit the brick, sister.  Beat it, toots.  Men are busy. 
[00:59:00]  Hey, I was just quoting a line.  Oh, that fine HBO special from Jim Norton's Monster Race.  The bricks, toots.  Toots.  Is there a woman alive that appreciates being called toots?  I submit to you, no.  All right, listen.  Light and sweet, honey.  All right.  Can we play this, please?  I don't know. 
[00:59:30]  Can we?  All right.  So you got the anchors behind the desk.  You got the sports guy, the weather girl, the news anchor.  Mm-hmm.  And the news anchorette.  Anchorette.  And people come running on set in scary, scary mass.  Let's play this through, finally.  And like I said, this video of the day will be up on onaradio.com later on today.  609 is the time.  We love emails.  Good morning at news10.  Thank you. 
[01:00:00]  One of those things.  Oh, is that hysterical?  One of those things you got to stop and enjoy, man.  By the way, the video is already up on other Opie and Anthony websites.  That is the sound.  Yeah.  If you've ever wondered, like, wow, do they get recordings of people being murdered?  Yeah.  That's it.  That's like what you hear.  This is having to not be a murder.  So then why is it so funny?  It's funny because it wasn't a real, like, murder or, you know, people frightened for their lives. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  That woman was totally scared for her life.  And you don't have to be worried about a guy in a mask running in.  You know when you get scared?  When your ex-co-worker walks in and he's wearing, like, military clothes.  Right.  There's a problem.  There's a problem.  Here's one of the anchors.  It's isolated.  Okay.  Ah!  Stupid E-Rock. 
[01:01:00]  Let's attempt to play it out this time.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  6-0-9 is the time.  We love emails.  Good morning at news10.net.  Oh, by the way, this is your news.  Yeah.  This is the news.  The news now is what they're doing.  They're scaring each other.  Right.  This is the news.  Turned into a fraternity.  Well, they're not doing, like, Dance Fridays. 
[01:01:30]  Frat House.  And everything else they do.  Yeah.  They do this.  Remember that time the guy scared Cronkite like that and he handed a desk?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You sure got me that time.  Did he?  6-0-9 is the time.  We love emails.  Good morning at news10.net.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know, the anchor guy still can't have a real moment. 
[01:02:00]  He goes, that was weird, guys.  Guys.  That was weird.  That was weird, weird stuff.  You know, we have a, you have the, we have an old tape of Tom Brokaw. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, really?  Same thing happened to him.  Yes.  Let's go to that tape right now.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Today in the news.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You scared the living s**t out of me.  I'm sitting in a pile of my own s**t.  Oh, that took me by surprise. 
[01:03:00]  I thought a bunch of s**t were coming in here to rob me.  Are we on?  Yeah, we are, Tom.  NBC Nightly News.  It was just our little gag for Halloween.  You know, Halloween.  Hell of a gag.  Halloween.  Halloween.  No, just say Halloween.  Just say Halloween forever.  Halloween.  What?  Halloween.  Halloween.  Halloween. 
[01:03:30]  All Saints Day.  That old gag.  All right, well, there you go.  Linger longer.  So then, everyone calmed down in this news station.  It was out of Sacramento.  And the woman apologizes for screaming.  And listen as the male anchor justifies it by saying,  you're girls.  You're girls.  You're on the end.  Monica and Melissa, or Melonica, if you like to call them. 
[01:04:00]  Melonica, Brantley.  Well, you couldn't see.  You just heard a scream behind you.  You heard a scream behind us.  Yeah.  And Melissa, you saw them running in?  What?  Yeah.  Oh, this is a rare one.  I apologize.  I really do scream quite loud on, like, roller coasters and stuff.  People don't like to go on them with me.  You know what?  I have to apologize as well because I really let off the story.  Then they're just laughing. 
[01:04:30]  I know.  People are dead.  Yeah, exactly.  How about you stop with the self-congratulatory,  basking in your own adorableness.  We got it.  It happened.  Move on.  I just can't let the moment go.  Yeah.  Exactly.  17 killed today in a car bombing.  I can't believe you scared us. 
[01:05:00]  Iraq comment?  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Yeah, I thought you did.  Mm-hmm.  I thought you did.  I saw it.  I saw.  That one was smooth today, right?  I'll say.  That was real smooth.  Silk.  Eric was a hell of a DJ in Florida, though.  Oh, boy, was he.  Yeah.  You were supposed to bring in other air checks there, Iraq.  Yeah.  Did you?  No.  Why?  You'll have it tomorrow morning.  What happened to you today?  I had some things happen yesterday, so I couldn't...  Ooh, what happened?  What'd you have happened?  Oh, boy. 
[01:05:30]  I don't want to get into it right now.  Wait a minute.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, good.  What happened?  No, just some health issues yesterday.  Health issues?  Be vague.  Yeah, wait.  Somebody...  Did you have sex with somebody who entered this country in 1961?  What's the matter?  We got to know you know.  As soon as I get some results, I'll let you know.  Does it affect...  It's you, though?  Yeah.  It's not a family member.  No.  So results.  So you've taken tests.  Yeah, a lot of them.  A battery of tests, would you say? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I'd say at least four or five different tests.  Is this something potentially serious?  Could be.  Could be.  Could be.  Diabetes.  Could be.  No.  It's not that.  Down syndrome.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's get to some systems here.  Nervous system.  That's one of them, yeah.  Circulatory system.  That could be the other one. 
[01:06:30]  That we don't know about yet.  But nervous system?  Yeah.  Does he have gout?  No.  Do you have Parkinson's?  Mm-mm.  MS?  No.  What part of your body's rotting?  Nothing.  Nothing's rotting.  Nothing's rotting.  All right.  He's dying.  But nervous system.  Let me think.  Is there any Michael J. Fox action happening?  No.  Okay.  Then what else could it be?  No Michael J. Fox action. 
[01:07:00]  That would imply movement.  Let's see.  What is it?  Battery test.  Oh, does it mean you're just nervous?  No.  Oh, okay.  So it could be.  Is it affecting any of your senses?  Could be, yeah.  Sight, hearing, smell, taste?  No, not those.  Maybe touch.  Touch.  You're having a numbing feeling.  Sometimes.  Where?  Uh. 
[01:07:30]  Because say your left arm.  No.  That's what I thought, but no.  Oh, Jesus.  Uh-oh.  Numbing.  Your third leg?  Is it in your leg, your calves?  No, it's actually, uh, like all over.  You're having an all over numbing feeling.  Is it half your body or the whole body?  Uh, about half.  Half.  Oh, boy.  Which half?  The, uh, upper half.  Oh, upper.  No, that's different.  It's supposed to be left and right. 
[01:08:00]  Your upper half from, like, your waist to your head is numb.  What do you have, a pinched nerve or something?  Um, no.  There's, um, damn, I forgot the name of it.  But it has something to do with, um, your nerves kind of, um, sending the wrong signals  to your brain so that it doesn't regulate your body temperature the right way or, um,  sometimes, like, uh, uh, uh, I get, it's just like numbing. 
[01:08:30]  Like, sometimes you go to grab something and you can't feel, like, uh.  Get a hold of yourself.  That's what a doctor should say.  You can't feel anything when you touch something?  It's not all the time.  It's very rare when that happens, but it's been happening a lot.  Is it tingly numb or just, or, or Novocaine feel fat fingered numb?  Nah, it's, uh.  More than usual.  It's a little tingly.  Tingly. 
[01:09:00]  Tingly.  Yeah.  It's like a bad commercial.  Like, he started by grabbing a cup of Sanka and then fell off the piano top.  Captain Handsome from Stupid Philly writes, uh, let's pray E-Rock has SIDS.  Oh, God.  Someone's saying it's called numbskull.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  When are you going to find out?  Um, I think beginning of next week I find out some of the results.  And what are they going to say?  Yeah, what are they looking for?  Did he give you some options that it might be? 
[01:09:30]  Um, it's a combination of things.  Um, they took a lot of blood yesterday.  Oh.  Um, had to do a, um, a EKG and a stress test.  You did a stress test?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  How'd that come out?  Um.  Don't know yet.  For the, they, they do the EKG for like, uh, I think for like a minute to two minutes.  And that came out okay.  So that was fine.  Uh, the stress, the stress test seems.  That says nothing.  Doesn't tell you about it.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  The stress test seems to be okay for now.  Um, it was a little high, but they said it wasn't anything.  You might have a, a clogged artery or something, my friend.  Oh, boy.  How's your cholesterol?  Um, that's what we're going to find out.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  So there's that.  There's, um, the nervous system problem.  And, um, now I, I just was informed I have to go for a sleep study.  So now there might be, yeah.  They should just come here and watch the work.  My mind was racing. 
[01:10:30]  Someone is suggesting.  And Jimmy crossed the finish line with a doozy.  Yeah.  Someone is suggesting, uh, that his arteries are clogged with the garlic butter saw.  Butter saw.  His favorite.  It might be, uh, they think you have sleep apnea?  That came up yesterday.  They think I might have it.  So I guess they're doing a lot of tests.  They're still trying to figure it out.  So maybe that's kind of good news.  No?  Mm-hmm.  Well, we'll see.  What do they think it might be?  Uh, it was like three different things. 
[01:11:00]  One was the apnea.  The second one, I, I forgot the name.  I think I have it at home.  But, uh.  Oh, there's a name for it?  Yeah.  Lou Gehrig's what?  Yeah.  It's not named after a ball player.  Yeah.  That's never good.  Actually, yeah.  Let me call Dr. Steve because he knows the name of it.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that'll be, uh, you know, your impending death could be a really good radio tease here.  So we'll find out what, see if you're still around.  We got a new Friday segment.  Right.  You gonna be all right, Iraq? 
[01:11:30]  You okay?  Yeah.  And, and, and more importantly, is any of this crap potentially contagious?  All right.  Nothing.  That's the important thing.  Nothing contagious, but, uh, there seems to be a lot of, of, uh, pills you gotta be taking.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Some of this stuff, I think, is, uh.  Narcotic?  Some of the same stuff that Fez takes, uh, uh, it starts with a C, I think.  Yes, I'm sure it does.  C-O. 
[01:12:00]  Exactly.  God, take it oral, are you right?  I've never seen that word pop up so quickly on the computer here.  What do you mean I have to sit on my pills?  All right.  Godspeed, Iraq.  Thank you.  Well, Steve from Bayshore is saying pills, or are they milk duds?  Oh, Iraq.  Yeah.  Wow.  Talk to Steve when we go to break.  Do your pills have little M's on them? 
[01:12:30]  They said I'd take the green one, and the brown one, and the blue one.  Oh, well, um, a lot of people also saying, uh, wishing you well.  Uh, hey, Iraq, good luck, bro.  Oh, don't say that.  From Kevin from Connecticut.  Never say that.  What's the nervous system one?  I don't know.  That's, uh.  I think you're a nervous Nelly.  I think you're a nervous Nelly, and that's what's causing all this.  You're under a lot of stress for some reason. 
[01:13:00]  The upper half of your body.  Yes.  Do you smell burning hair any time?  No.  No.  No metallic taste.  What does that mean?  That means he's having a stroke.  Oh, my God.  Burning hair.  Yeah, I learned that from the Sopranos.  It's nice when you leave the, uh, office, and they said, oh, yeah, you make sure you  take Bayer every, uh, like, twice a day.  What, to thin your blood out?  Oh, they think you got some heart thing happening, bro.  Yeah, they're, they must, must be, uh, your cholesterol is probably ridiculous. 
[01:13:30]  You've been yelling at your eating habits for three years.  How old are you?  27?  29.  Did they put you on Lipitor or anything?  No.  No, right now it's just, uh.  Numbing could be, like, poor circulation, which means it could be clogged.  I'm no doctor, but my dad had a lot of heart things in his life, and I know a little bit  about this stuff.  Jesus.  You got numb fingertips?  Um, no, not usually.  Just where? 
[01:14:00]  Overall chest?  Um, chest, arms.  Oh, boy.  That means it's a small clog.  You don't exercise.  Jesus Christ.  You don't exercise, right?  That's not true.  Do you?  Yeah, he, he, he tries.  All right, we gotta take a break.  I do.  I know, uh, Iraq's health is important, but, uh, let's be honest, commercials are more  important.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we really don't have to get the spots in.  Sorry, Iraq, that, that commercials trump your, uh, impending doom.  It's, uh, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, God. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, I will leave you alone.  I will leave you alone.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's, uh, let's see who won the $1,000.  Uh, Ben, what's up?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, you scared me!  Hey, Ben.  How you doing?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
[01:15:00]  Oh, wow, that's fucked.  Car payments?  Sucks, right? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  What, are you behind on them?  No.  Oh.  Just going to throw a few months in?  Yeah, why not, right?  All right, Ben, well, congratulations.  You're the latest $1,000 winner, all right?  Thank you, guys.  All right, we've got to figure out what tomorrow's sound is for the people out there  that want to win $1,000.  If I won $1,000 and I was a working guy like the old days,  I would not think responsibly like that.  I'd be at the hobby shop getting a radio control helicopter 
[01:16:00]  and have to tell my landlord I don't have the rent.  Oh, of course.  That's what I would do.  Responsibility.  Are you kidding?  Buy something fun.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  Pay off something and have no fun,  and then the next month, what, are you going to win another $1,000?  No.  So you just blow it on something that you're going to enjoy for a little while.  You're in the hole, and it's free money, so enjoy it.  Be in debt.  Let's see what else we got. 
[01:16:30]  Gossip and emailing are among top office peeves.  Man charged with having sex with a 92-year-old woman's corpse.  That is a great little story.  Unfortunately, not many details,  because I really want to hear all the ins and outs of that story.  Probably more fun than when she was alive.  At least you don't have to hear the stories.  It looks the same, it smells the same,  and you don't have to hear about what her grandchildren are doing in college. 
[01:17:00]  Really?  How much was bread when you were five?  Yeah, great.  One-room schoolhouse, you say.  What else?  They weren't even allowed to vote, huh?  That is just one of those stories.  What the hell does the family think?  Or do?  I don't know.  Is it with your grandma?  This is what we got on that one.  A man employed by hospitals in Teaneck and Summit,  of course, of course he works at a hospital,  has been charged with having sex with a 92-year-old woman's corpse 
[01:17:30]  at the Teaneck facility.  Lab technician Anthony Marino,  or Marino, 24 in Manhattan,  was arrested Sunday morning after security personnel at Holy Name Hospital  observed him engaging in sexual activity with the body in the hospital morgue.  What the F?  In the morgue.  I could see if it was Anna Nicole 10 minutes after she kicked off.  You're almost obligated to jump on just to brag to your friends.  You know?  Wave at everybody.  92 years old.  Take a picture. 
[01:18:00]  Take a picture of yourself.  Hey.  This is disgusting.  He was charged with desecrating human remains.  It's a crime, huh?  He's required to submit to a psychological evaluation  and is being held on $400,000 bail.  That's a lot of bail for that crime.  I'm not saying it isn't a completely sick thing to do,  but desecration of the dead,  I don't think it should warrant $400,000. 
[01:18:30]  No?  No.  What's she going to do?  All right.  Exactly.  What else are you doing with 92-year-olds?  Yeah.  Why not let somebody get some enjoyment out of it?  She's going right into the ground anyway.  Why not give somebody a last hurrah?  She's probably, for the past friggin' 30 years,  just been doling out misery to everybody.  Just a burden in the old home.  30 years?  Why do you think 62's old?  You got your numbers all messed up, man.  Well, I did.  I meant 20 years.  Oh, 20.  Well, 72's not even that old these days.  Well, at 72, could be.  She could be insane by 72. 
[01:19:00]  Nah.  Some people are very, completely have their wits about them  and healthy at 72.  Other people, they're already in the home going,  Help!  Not many.  Not many.  No?  Nah, it gets a lot older than that in those homes.  Yeah?  Yeah, Mommy was in one of those for a while.  Really?  Recovering from a horrific car accident.  And you saw a lot of old people in there?  Yeah, and they weren't in their 70s.  Really?  Like 90s?  90s.  People celebrating their 100th birthday with just one. 
[01:19:30]  It's got to be a treat.  With one great-grandson and a birthday cake.  How depressing.  What do they do?  They don't put 100 candles on, right?  No.  Just put that big 100.  Yeah, one giant candle that says 100 on it.  Big.  What would it be a Roman candle pointed at her?  Unlike the 90-year-old woman at the morgue that got the Roman war helmet.  So, there you go.  That's sick F.  And this is very sad news. 
[01:20:00]  I don't want to bum everybody out, but scientists find the oldest living animal.  Yep.  And kill it.  Wow.  And that's the headline, too.  Yeah.  What is this thing?  British marine biologists, they found what they think is the oldest living animal.  It's always in the water, the oldest thing.  Yes, it was.  Yeah.  And they had to kill it.  It was a team from Bangor University, and they were dredging the waters of Iceland.  Some stupid research they do.  And they found this unfortunate specimen.  They said, belonging to the clam species. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  And they cut to its shell.  Wait, wait.  The clam species, Arctica islandica.  Yeah.  That's what Iraq has.  Yes, Arctica islandica.  Yes, that is what Iraq has.  Arctica islandica.  That's when your temperature is off, and somehow that morphs into incompetence.  Brr, I'm chilly.  What was I supposed to do?  The guy can't even be cut a break when he's waiting on tests about his health.  That could be really bad news. 
[01:21:00]  Cut him some slack.  Yeah, man.  They cut through its shell, which made it more of an exclam.  Oh, that's what killed it.  They had to count its growth rings, and they realized it had been between 405 and 410 years old.  Humans.  No way.  Humans just stink.  And they kill it by cutting it.  Only after researchers cut through its shell, which made it more of an exclam, and counted  its growth rings, so they realized how old it had been.  Yeah.  Another clam of the same species had been verified at 220 years old, and a third may have lived  374 years, but this most recent clam was the oldest yet, and we had to kill it. 
[01:21:30]  Couldn't they take a piece of its shell and just ask it?  Yeah.  Or how about you look at this thing and go, wow, that's old.  That's an old clam.  That's what the guy the Morse said about.  It was 200.  Bounce pass.  And a layup for Anthony.  Layup.  I'd say Anthony slammed that one in with fervor.  And then you've got your top-earning dead celebrities.  This list comes out every year. 
[01:22:00]  And, well, Presley is back up at number one.  He made over $40 million last year, and he's dead.  He's been dead for 30 years.  30 years.  And he made over $40 million last year.  Rounding out your top five, you've got John Lennon in second place.  Charles Schultz, the Peanuts guy.  George Harrison is in the top ten for the first time ever.  And you've got Albert Einstein in fifth place. 
[01:22:30]  Top-earning dead celebrity.  That is from Baby Einstein.  Those stupid things that are out for little kids.  What's stupid about that?  Baby Einstein?  Yeah, what's wrong with the kids listening to a little Einstein crap?  Because it has...  Do you think Albert Einstein would have endorsed that garbage?  Yeah.  Truck.  Truck.  Truck.  Exactly.  Ball.  Ball.  Baby parrot, it should be called.  Baby parrot.  A little dope just repeats what he heard. 
[01:23:00]  He has no idea.  He picks up a ball, and he goes,  Ball!  And then he eats it.  And then he throws an orange to someone with a catcher's mitt.  Because he's a dunce.  Your kid is a dead-end dunce.  Live with it.  Baby Einstein.  Let's see the little crap factory splitting at him.  That's what I want to see.  That's Baby Einstein.  Build an A-bomb and blow up your playpen.  Little creeps.  I hate kids. 
[01:23:30]  Ah, let's go to Freddie in Chicago.  Freddie, what's up?  Not much, man.  It's a bad day in Chicago.  They took you guys off the air to put a 1970 couple of fools on there.  An overgrown weight, Steve Dahl, and a boring Gary Meyer.  Oh, we like those guys.  Nah, they're alright.  And they're just stunting.  They're dark.  They're stunting.  1970s.  They're stunting.  That has nothing to do with what CKG is going to become.  So...  Steve Dahl left, right?  He's going to, but they're giving him, like, CKG for the rest of the week, and then he's  going to move to another station and do mornings, and then I think CKG's going to do some 
[01:24:00]  kind of, like, fresh format.  Really?  I believe that's what's happening, yes.  I'm sorry, sir.  How are you in on everything?  Huh?  How are you in on everything?  I'm just in the know.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I'll just leave.  Huh?  No!  I can't remember the line.  Then I'll...  Line?  Oh, I'll leave you alone.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Alone.  I gotta remember that.  I'll leave you alone. 
[01:24:30]  Okay, Opie.  I'll leave you alone.  Leave you alone.  All of a sudden, the arms opened up.  Flap, flap, flap, flap, flap, flap.  Opie turned around.  He said, you fly back to school now, little star.  Fly, fly, fly, fly.  Karen and Jersey.  Karen.  Yeah, she was walking out.  Migs threw something at her.  So we called her back.  Look deep inside yourself, Tracy.  Pantene. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, Karen.  Hey, I'm just worried about you, Rock, and I wanted to make sure...  Karen has the...  Hold on a minute.  Are you insane?  No, what are you saying, sweetheart?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Wow, that's...  I know they hate when I say it, but that is a doozy.  Come on.  We're all just having fun.  Yeah, yeah.  We're just being silly.  Karen and Jersey.  Oh, we lost Karen and Jersey.  What was she saying, that dear?  Something about E-Rock and with his health issues. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, with his new e-disease.  If he passes out, will someone in the studio give him UPS?  Oh, give him a man UPS.  I'd be lucky if we noticed.  Got a link longer for that one.  Or E-Rock.  We love E-Rock.  He knows that.  It's still bad for him.  Of course we do.  What a staff we have.  Jesus Christ.  Start training somebody on his duties immediately.  Okay.  That's that.  Okay.  You find the AIDS monkey.  In baseball news, you got the Red Sox winning the World Series. 
[01:26:00]  Of course, you got Joe Girardi as the new Yankees manager.  He looks like a Yankees skipper.  Very handsome, cut, chiseled guy.  Baseball in general is beating up A-Rod because his agent decided to announce that he was not  resigning with the Yankees during the fine, fine game that was going on.  The World Series, you're not supposed to make any announcements.  This is an unwritten thing in baseball where you're like, when the World Series is happening, 
[01:26:30]  it's supposed to be all about the World Series.  It's an unwritten law in baseball.  Like, look, this is why we're all in baseball, to play in the World Series.  So when World Series time comes around, everyone should shut their yaps.  And as soon as the World Series is over, then you start talking about who your coach  is going to be and all this.  But A-Rod's agent decided to send out the press release during game four of the World Series,  right in the middle of the game.  And of course, then the announcers had to start discussing that.  And it took away from the game.  Because a lot of people in Boston, especially, pissed off. 
[01:27:00]  A lot of people in baseball, pissed off.  They won the goddamn thing, so no one cared.  It shows A-Rod's character.  His agent, too, is a dirtbag.  But you know what?  It's all about A-Rod.  He's a selfish pig of a player.  He's a great regular season player.  He's won nothing.  He won nothing in Seattle.  He won nothing in Texas.  He won nothing in New York.  And he'll win nothing wherever he goes.  I want him gone.  Go.  You want $300 million?  Die.  So that was a dick move on his part and his agent's part. 
[01:27:30]  Then you got Girardi's has been announced.  Yes, like we said.  That means Don Mattingly's out.  He's been a Yankee soldier forever.  And he's so pissed, he's leaving the team.  And then you got Joe Torre supposedly going to the Dodgers.  Good for Joe.  And supposedly there's going to be a whole bunch of people following Torre to the Dodgers.  Let them enjoy the show.  Well, that's what they were speculating, but...  Well, that was James Ford.  James Ford's smug guy, we call him.  Smug guy.  Smug guy.  Was speculating.  A lot of players can follow Joe to L.A. 
[01:28:00]  The way he holds the microphone.  He holds the microphone kind of sideways.  Mwah.  A smug guy.  And he leans his head and there's one side of his mouth is open.  He's just like, well, we're here in front of the Yankee store.  They go to the Yankee store that isn't even open.  They don't want to deal with Bronx traffic.  No.  Stand on 42nd Street.  Dopes.  Anything with a...  He's standing in front of a man with a Yankee hat.  I don't mind.  Could you get a real location?  What's the matter with this CW11?  They're getting lazy. 
[01:28:30]  Marge?  Marge is on the phone from the little shelter.  Marge.  Oh, it's Marge from the little shelter.  Sorry to hear what happened to you at that hospital.  You all right?  Good morning.  Do me one favor.  Marge.  Please.  We don't just do favors like this.  It's quid pro quo, Marge.  You don't know what to ask you.  Quid pro pro quo pro.  Quid pro quo.  Right.  You tell us things and we laugh at you.  Do not let Jim say anything.  You hear about the cats at JFK? 
[01:29:00]  They're setting traps.  It's horrible.  It's just horrible.  I guess there's packs and packs of cats all over JFK.  And you got those union guys.  They don't have time to deal with stupid cats.  They got luggage to get on planes.  And they got to wave some planes in.  Can I say one thing?  And these cats are taking over JFK, so they're setting traps.  And now the animal rights activists are up in arms.  They're like, how dare you do that?  You got to catch them in a safe way.  And you got to neuter them.  And then you got to send them back onto the JFK property. 
[01:29:30]  To the runways.  Hello.  Oh, hello.  I have no idea, gentlemen, who I'm speaking to.  How should they catch them?  Can you please identify yourself?  No.  No.  Marge, I got a question for you.  Which?  Wait a minute.  I have a question for you before you can say anything.  Yes.  Anthony, please say, this is Anthony.  This is Anthony.  Hi.  I have a question for you, Marge.  This is Anthony.  I have a question for you.  Before you say anything.  Marge, this is Anthony.  I got a question for you.  Okay.  Yes.  As long as it's not Jim.  I refuse to speak to Jim. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, why?  What is wrong with Jimmy?  He's a rat.  Why?  Why is Jimmy a rat?  The meanest, nastiest things about Little Shelter and me and the animals.  I will continue the conversation if I do not have to speak to Jim Norton.  We'll keep him quiet.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Anthony, why don't you talk to Marge from Little Shelter?  Hello, Anthony.  What do you think should be happening with these cats?  Go.  With the cats?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:30:30]  Try to find homes for them.  What we have to do.  Boring!  All right.  Move on to something else.  I'm here for a different reason.  Hey, I know you're here for a different reason.  Can I ask you a question?  Very important question.  Is it true?  Now, be honest.  I will.  Is it true?  What is this?  It's Anthony.  Hi.  How are you?  It's Jim Norton.  How are you?  Is it true that when somebody works for you, or works over there at the Little Shelter, 
[01:31:00]  that they have to sign something that prohibits them from rescuing animals for two years after  they leave the Little Shelter?  I've never heard of that.  Well, Marge, I get my information from inside the Little Shelter.  So, in other words, there's a stool pigeon there.  There's a stool pigeon.  Oh, so you're admitting.  There's a stoolie.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  We don't allow stool pigeons or birds at Little Shelter, so whatever information you  have is incorrect.  It's a stool cat.  What's wrong with birds, Marge? 
[01:31:30]  Wait a minute.  Here's the deal.  I'm calling you.  Wasn't there a young girl, wasn't there a young lady that tried to get a job at Little Shelter  and she refused to sign that piece of paper prohibiting her from saving animals if she  had been fired from the Little Shelter, and she refused, and you said, no job.  Wait a minute.  Am I allowed to say...  It's more important to keep people in a no-compete contract than it is to save animals?  You know, why, when I call...  Why is there such... 
[01:32:00]  And I heard, Marge, I heard from this stool pigeon, Marge, that you are also, you used  to work at the North Shore Animal League, and what you are doing for the Little Shelter  is turning it from a nice, non-profit organization into a profitable organization where you are  pocketing money.  All right.  Nah, nah, nah.  Wait a minute.  Can I have something to say here, please?  You may retort.  First of all, first of all, I thought you guys were my friends.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  You thought it was.  And it seems as though you really don't care about the animals at Little Shelter.  That's a pack of lies.  Oh, my God, Marge.  I have a cat myself.  His name is Jack Jack, and Steve from Bayshore gave him to me.  We totally...  He's a bag.  We totally support...  We isn't.  We totally support...  Deflection.  We totally support...  Marge.  You support...  Hello.  We totally support that crematorium you call a rescue center. 
[01:33:00]  And by the way, a little update on the cat my brother wanted to give you, and remember,  and you guys couldn't take the cat, so now he was stuck with this weird cat that's kind  of blind.  Well, one of the little cat's eyes exploded over the weekend.  Holy Jesus.  No, it didn't.  Oh, yeah, it did.  There's your update.  We'll put that thing out on Halloween.  There's your update.  Marge, is the new slogan for the Little Shelter, greed is good?  Wait a minute.  That's right.  Yes?  Yes.  It's unfair.  There are three people speaking, and there's one person here who is trying to make sense 
[01:33:30]  out of all this nonsense.  Okay.  Put a dog on the phone.  We want to talk to a dog.  I want to talk to a dog.  A smarter one.  So at least would you give me the opportunity to be heard?  Yes.  You may be heard.  Thank you very much.  What you are talking about is...  Is failure to communicate.  There are people at Little Shelter that, for whatever reason, they didn't understand the  commitment. 
[01:34:00]  We are trying to get as many animals saved out of shelters that destroy.  As long as they go to the Little Shelter, so you can say, I have X amount of animals  and need X amount of money.  Wait a minute.  You promised me to be safe.  I'm letting you speak, Marge.  Tell them, please.  Yes?  By the way, I have tried desperately to...  Wait, what did she say?  Hello?  Yeah.  All right.  So here's what I want to say. 
[01:34:30]  The Little Shelter is operating on a shoestring budget.  Yes.  So I'm telling...  That shoestring goes for miles.  I never understood that term, the shoestring budget thing.  All you have to do, Greg and Anthony...  Did you use my real name?  If you go over to the shelter and you see for yourself that there is nothing there that  we have any money.  Yes.  You'll hide the back room where you guys sit like Tony Montana.  Just putting hundreds of thousands through the counting machines with a clock without 
[01:35:00]  a 12 in it.  Who didn't notice that?  What did he think?  Who didn't notice?  Did Tony Montana think it was hole in the wall a clock?  That is quarter past spying eye.  I mean...  Yes, Marjorie.  Please.  If you have been to Little Shelter, which I assume...  I drove past many a time on my way to a party because...  Why don't you drive in?  I'll drive through it.  You keep this up. 
[01:35:30]  It's very easy.  Marjorie, come on.  Let's go.  We got radio.  We got to give you a plug.  Let's give you a plug.  The North Shore Animal League, 25 Davis Avenue, 516-883-7575.  We're always happy to help you at the North Shore Animal League.  I don't know why there's competition between organizations that are trying to save animals.  I'm never calling you again.  What?  What?  I'm never calling you again.  Why?  Because you are so cruel to animals.  Cruel?  You should see how I treat my Jack Jack on Pal Talk. 
[01:36:00]  He goes up on my shoulder like a parrot.  And sometimes I put him on my head and make a cat hat.  The people love it.  He drinks beer and wine.  Raise money for a medical center?  No.  A medical center?  Here I am begging you on bended knees.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You stay on those knees.  Sexy.  Sexy still.  All I get is a lot of negativity.  Yeah, you must have been something before electricity, huh? 
[01:36:30]  Hey, I'm no doorknob either.  I love the Caddyshack theme today.  And it's a word for a bunch of degenerate, lowlife, lying hypocrites.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  But Marge, me and your father went to war together.  Well, Marge, we'll do it for you.  We played golf together.  Here's the plug.  The North Shore Animal League, 25 Davis Avenue.  It's in Port Washington.  They take good care of the animals. 
[01:37:00]  Unlike that murder center, it's 516-883-7575.  Murder center!  Is it true you have a room with rotating blades that lowers onto the cattery?  I will tell you one thing.  Yes?  That any time you give a non-kill shelter a plug, it makes my heart good.  So give it to North Shore Animal League.  Give it to Bideway.  Give it to...  What's a kill shelter?  Yeah, name a kill shelter.  Yeah.  But you want to know something.  Where are the kill shelters? 
[01:37:30]  I'm sorry?  Where are these kill shelters?  Why are you continuing to talk to us?  I thought you said you would never talk to us again.  The kill shelters that are in the city?  Are they in the city?  The kill shelters that are on Long Island.  They do not have kill shelters on Long Island, Marge.  That is a lie.  They don't...  Name one.  I don't want to.  Damn it.  That isn't the right thing to do.  But I had her.  And I've lived my life trying to do the right thing, unlike some of these hypocrites that  are just trying to hurt our...  Marge? 
[01:38:00]  I promise you one thing, gentlemen.  What?  And here's my promise.  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  So here comes the threat.  This is to you, Greg, and it's to you.  Did you use my real name again?  Yeah.  And it's to...  And...  Wait a minute.  And it's to that very nice man that answers the phone in the beginning.  I don't like the fact that you're bad-mouthed...  Why's your bad-mouthed Jim Norton?  This is a promise.  Why's your bad-mouthed me?  I'm not going to let you say it to you.  Come here, you baby.  Oh!  Here's some sounds from the little shelter.  Meow! 
[01:38:30]  Oh!  Meow!  Come here, kitty.  Come here.  Come here, baby.  Come here.  Yeah.  Yeah, gotcha.  Meow!  Oh!  I just...  I cut half of them off.  Wait, we got to think about a Marge.  Marge?  Marge?  Bye for good, gentlemen.  Bye.  For good?  Marge, but we wanted to cut open your clam and see how old you are.  You can do whatever you like, but you don't have to worry about hearing from me.  Marge, I will donate to the little shelter, like I always do, because you send me the little 
[01:39:00]  address labels that I use.  But I resent...  And then you're not going to call anymore.  Well, thanks a lot.  I support the little shelter.  Maybe not here vocally on the air, because I want to make a little fun and have a little  fun with you, but I give money to the little shelter for your little address labels.  Well, thanks for nothing.  Do you believe everything that I tell you?  And you're being a...  No.  You don't.  Cat lover.  Then that's it for me.  You badmouth Jim Norton?  Why?  Yes, Jim Norton's a good friend of ours, and he's an animal lover, too. 
[01:39:30]  You ever see horse gag?  Jim has never spoken up in defense of little shelter.  Yeah.  Never.  He has, too.  That's true.  He has the North Shore Animal League.  Absolutely.  25 Davis Avenue, Port Washington, New York.  That's fine.  So, as I said, you're not hurting my feelings by supporting other shelters.  Can you start the whole music?  This is it for Marge.  We're all in the same business.  Are you changing the name to Little Auschwitz?  That's what I heard.  The only difference between little shelter and other shelters is that we don't have squat 
[01:40:00]  in money, and that's why I call...  Are Beats Mock Free Kittens.  Is that the sign?  That's all I have to say.  I think you should try another shelter now and let them...  We didn't want to try one.  Yeah, what do you think?  We're running around looking for a host shelter?  Looking for shelters?  That fertilizer factory, you call it.  Well, we're too busy looking for a host radio station.  Marge, then this is for you. 
[01:40:30]  Marge, this is it for you, Marge.  This is your last appearance.  We're giving you the sad Hulk walking away music.  So, say what you have.  Say what you want to say.  All right.  You got 15 seconds, Marge.  All right.  I just want to say that Little Shelter is obviously the best, most caring, most deserving,  and most under-budgeted shelter in the United States.  Say what you want.  All right, Marge.  Need the money.  And that's all I have to say.  It's been nice knowing you guys. 
[01:41:00]  Au revoir.  Goodbye, goodbye, and God bless you.  Adios.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Marge, there she goes.  The last appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  That was it.  She got fired.  That's the problem.  She probably got fired for stealing money.  She's probably been bilking them out of thousands.  Bilking.  And they fired her.  Make it look like she's making a graceful exit.  Beat it, you old hooker.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're a bit late, and we still don't have the sound for tomorrow.  What's going on here?  What do we got?  What do we got?  Creepers, creepers.  How about shovel baseball, or is that too... 
[01:41:30]  Oh, that's too...  That's too harsh?  Yeah.  All right, we'll figure it out.  We'll give you the sound that you got to listen for for tomorrow to win $1,000.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  Sergeant G from Iraq writes on the S&P back.  What a rough day.  You lost two stations and a cattery.  I guess.  Yeah, it's a rough day for us today. 
[01:42:00]  We could deal with losing a couple radio stations, but we can't deal with losing a cattery.  No.  Those aren't easy to come by, man.  How many catteries do you even know of?  How many radio shows do you know that actually have a cattery that they can brag about?  And we lost that.  The Little Shelter Slaughterhouse and Fertilizer Farm.  By the way, I think we should start some kind of a poll.  How long will it take Marge from the Little Shelter to call us back?  To call us again.  It's not going to happen today, but she'll call back eventually. 
[01:42:30]  It'll be a little while, but she'll have something to plug.  By the way, we're continuing to make believe that we weren't kicked off in Chicago and West Palm Beach.  Making believe that didn't happen, because that's what you do at a radio show, even though all the phones are lit with people wanting to talk about that.  But we'll make believe that didn't go down today.  Yeah.  One reason why we can't take a lot of phone calls, because we're in the business of make-believe now.  It's also Rock Scream Tuesday, 80s New Wave Tuesday, Far Away Phone Call Tuesday, Hummer Tuesday, Makeup Stuff Tuesday, and guess what? 
[01:43:00]  Tim is suggesting a new one for today.  Right?  New one.  Is E-Rock Alive Tuesday?  No.  Oh, no, he could be dying.  Maybe it's the big C.  Is E-Rock Alive?  Diabetes?  No, it's going to have C.  Maybe a sleep apnea.  Is E-Rock dying?  Enough. 
[01:43:30]  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Enough.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  It's a coronary.  His arteries are clogged.  It's all that garlic butter sauce.  His arteries are clogged with mannage.  It's his nervous system.  Could he be dying?  I think he just forgets to breathe.  You're crazy, don't you know?  It's E-Rock Alive Tuesday.  Oh my God, that's terrible. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  E-Rock, comment?  Comment?  No comment on that one?  None at all.  No comment.  Do you think that's hurtful?  Right about now, he's like, why did I share with you guys?  Right?  Nah.  Well, it is E-Rocktober.  Wow, what a way to friggin' end E-Rocktober with this big cliffhanger. 
[01:44:30]  Are you okay?  I'm imagining the first and only.  Oh.  How much iced tea do you drink a day?  Next year will be posthumous.  Oh, God.  At least a gallon and a half.  A gallon and a half of iced tea a day?  A gallon and a half of iced tea.  Do you know how much caffeine that is?  Maybe that's why your nervous system's shutting down.  I can't shake anymore.  Yeah.  Why don't you stop it already?  Why don't you stop treating yourself?  Why don't you have a little gumption?  Yeah.  Do you think I want to eat a turkey wrap? 
[01:45:00]  No.  Yes, that's good.  Oh, okay.  That's why you ordered it.  Silly.  Who wouldn't like a big piece of chocolate cake?  Wouldn't that be wonderful?  It sure would.  It would, E-Rock.  Don't shake your head no.  Oh, is that part of the disease?  Sorry.  I want to apologize to E-Rock.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Yeah.  All right.  It's all new outlook on life, isn't it? 
[01:45:30]  You probably just got to start living healthy for real now.  Yeah, you can't fake it anymore.  That's what's going to come down to.  No sneaking up snacks or anything.  Yeah.  And telling us that you ate a salad last night.  You know, high cholesterol is not only what you eat, but it's your family.  Family doesn't have that.  All right.  Then it's all what you eat.  Then you were adopted.  You're just eating horrifically.  I think mom and dad have something to tell you finally.  Oh, boy.  A gallon and a half of ice tea a day. 
[01:46:00]  Why?  A gallon and a half?  How many treats does one boy need?  I don't know.  Yes.  And that's exactly what it is.  How much sweetness?  You need little treats and sweets and things.  He's a boy who needs a lot of love and a lot of care.  And he's a boy who likes a sweet beverage.  He's got a sweet tooth.  Mother, I don't like milk.  I don't like water.  All right.  You have soda then.  Thanks, mom.  Have some iced tea. 
[01:46:30]  As a matter of fact, have a couple of gallons of it.  Like you're fueling a car.  Here's a funnel.  I'll pour iced tea in your mouth like Peter O'Toole and Caligula, and then we'll stab  your stomach and all the iced tea will go all over you.  He rocks mom.  She's a lovely lady.  Of course she is.  Like that Roman guard.  They're going to tie it off with a string.  Yeah.  You got to get off that iced tea.  Yeah.  That's what I was told.  Are the Nagels bummed that we're not on in West Palm Beach, Florida anymore? 
[01:47:00]  Or are they relieved?  It's like, you know, I heard them talking about your son again today.  I would imagine they're relieved in some way.  They don't know unless they just woke up now and found out.  I didn't tell them.  Yeah.  All right.  People are wondering if you're seeing a neurologist or just a family doctor.  An internist right now.  Internist.  There's not even a guy with a medical license?  Oh, yeah.  Just an intern?  He's seeing an intern is what he's saying. 
[01:47:30]  He's seeing a guy that gets coffee for the doctor?  Rene gave him a checkup.  And Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy and Rene gave him a four-handed massage.  He answered MW4M on Craigslist, and they showed up and massaged his little chubby body.  Oh.  All right.  What do you guys want to do now?  I think you're going to talk about E-Rock's bad health.  I know, yeah, I know.  I don't want to do that until 11.  Exactly.  That's all I want to talk about.  I just want to find out.  I want to know now.  A lot of distractions today, right? 
[01:48:00]  We're worried about you.  Yeah.  I mean, we're teasing you like we just think you're a lump, but we really do love you.  We're worried about you.  Yeah, some days.  All right.  We're done with that.  Let's move on.  Oh, no.  What do you want to be about you?  Exactly.  What do you want?  Lose more stations?  Go ahead.  It's all about your health.  Go ahead.  Why not?  No, I'm teasing, man.  I'm teasing.  Why not make it be an art show?  What do you got?  You got to finish the sentence.  People listening.  No, I don't.  Please do.  E-Rock, just finish the sentence, please. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Sometimes it was.  No, right.  Why would you fall for that?  God.  How many people out there are like, oh, God, E-Rock, don't go for the base, please.  For once, just swim away.  All right.  Hey, Steve, what are you up to?  No.  Yeah, of course not.  Oh, man.  Why would you be up to something?  Listen, you got anything?  No.  No, of course not.  I mean, like E-Rock.  Is everyone just avoiding Tracy in the hallways? 
[01:49:00]  Um, no.  I went back and talked to Tracy for about a half hour before.  How's she feeling?  A little hurt.  Exactly.  That is a little scorn.  I think her feelings are hurt.  But why?  Because it's funny when it's somebody else.  It's not funny when it's you.  What are you talking about?  I've lived under the bus for five years.  I understand that, but you're a bit more conditioned to the tire treads being on your chest.  Maybe she's not.  So instead of producing today's show, you made sure her feelings weren't hurt for a half hour?  Yes, that's what I did.  We're well on our way to zero station.  That's right.  Exactly. 
[01:49:30]  And we're also, we don't even want to be on satellite anymore.  We're podcasting from now on.  That's right.  Look for the O&A podcast coming soon.  All right.  Hey, David Copperfield, now we got voicemails happening.  Oh, no.  This is what?  Huh?  This is what?  He's voicemailed girls in the past.  Well, supposedly, he allegedly raped some girl on Rape Island.  Rape Island.  He owns an island. 
[01:50:00]  Where it's really hard to get to.  It's a boat ride.  It's a plane.  A plane.  Another boat.  It's crazy.  It's not an easy place to go to, and he pretty much owns the whole.  He owns the whole island, and there's not much on it except for him.  Is it like Fantasy Island?  You didn't have that, Ricky?  Why would he?  Wow.  How fast does that numbness work?  Why?  Taking Novocaine's depositories. 
[01:50:30]  Yes, there's the music.  The plane.  The plane.  Look, here comes the numbskull.  But two, his fantasy is he wants to go to work and be respected once.  Send him back.  We cannot do that.  It's too big a fantasy.  Good impressions, ladies and germs.  It's awful.  It's nerving me to try to do any impressions.  They're both terrible.  Here's your bullet point. 
[01:51:00]  And so, rape charges, allegedly, against their David Copperfield, and now other women coming  out of the woodwork.  And his M.O. is very simply...  At his house?  Huh?  Coming out of the woodwork of his house.  Yeah, pretty much.  They've been boarded up behind the walls.  Columbo called it, and the beeper went off, and they knew that they were there.  And basically, more women coming out and saying, hey, some weird stuff happened with me and  David Copperfield.  I guess his thing is he looks for really hot blondes in the audience, brings them up on  stage, and then takes it a little further, brings them backstage for a little meet and 
[01:51:30]  greet, and then it turns out it's just him and her or something like that.  Then he gets all sorts of weird info from the ladies, and I think he catalogs it, and  he gets phone numbers and stuff.  And now, a voicemail is coming out, where David Copperfield leaves a voicemail, inviting  one of these women to the Bahamas.  Of course.  Hey, David Copperfield, your friend from Las Vegas.  We've got a very interesting opportunity for you. 
[01:52:00]  The opportunity?  An invitation to party.  If you could look at your calendar, it's in a week and a half from now, if you're available  to come to the island.  We talked about that, and I think a lot of people down there are going to invite you.  Absolutely.  The island.  I just like the way he said, I've got an opportunity for you.  Yeah.  Want to lose a couple teeth and get a black eye?  Well, here's your chance.  What kind of opportunity could it be on an island?  A deserted island.  It's his island.  I like how he just calls it, you know, the island. 
[01:52:30]  You know, the island.  Where horrific things happen.  Because you think the Bahamas, you're going to go to the Bahamas, maybe a nice resort  hotel or something like that.  No, he owns it.  It's an island you cannot leave.  You can't leave this place without him helping you off of this island.  Well, there have to be servants there.  There has to be servants.  Is there no medical attention on the island?  Nothing?  I would love to find out everything about this island.  We don't know much about the island.  I bet you there's people there off to the side that help him out and do security for 
[01:53:00]  him.  And they just keep it all quiet.  They probably live, you know what it is?  They probably live way on the other side of the island.  Yeah.  And then he's on his side where he can do his wacky rapes or whatever the hell he wants  to do.  How big of an island is it?  It's giant.  He owns Cuba.  It's Australia.  Wow, we both bombed.  Yeah.  I went for the smile island, you went for the big one.  We both swung and missed. 
[01:53:30]  Ant, you got a funny island name?  I'm Galapagos.  There you go.  He owns Staten.  That would have been the obvious.  Obviously, some black guys on the road this morning.  Hey, we got to give you...  Hey, that's a trifecta, though.  You got to give all three.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So, I know what island he owns because he made the Statue of Liberty disappear.  He owns Ellis Island. 
[01:54:00]  Wow.  I think he owns...  Call up with your favorite island.  What is this, the Howie Carr show?  Howie, I like long.  Long is good.  Long, I...  Hey, here's your sound for tomorrow if you want to win $1,000.  You got to listen for this.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Ooh, I like that.  It's got a theme.  And I thought we used that one already, but people are saying we did not.  No!  So, in honor of Halloween tomorrow, this is what you're listening for if you want to win $1,000. 
[01:54:30]  I like to make werewolf movies.  Tenth caller tomorrow will win $1,000 between 7 and 7.30 when you hear that.  I like to make werewolf movies.  This sound right here.  I like to make werewolf movies.  The one I'm going to play when I stop talking.  I like to make werewolf movies.  And this sound.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Will be up on ONAradio.com.  Right.  Can we point out what a creep David Copperfield sounds like, by the way? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, he's, uh...  This is David, uh...  You go down to the island.  Have to hold the phone with one hand.  What a creep.  Hey, remember?  A little while ago, we were talking about that 92-year-old dead lady?  Yes.  Yeah.  That's not the sickest story of the day.  Can't be.  Come on.  Not the sickest story of the day.  Thanks to Danny, he found this gem.  This lovely gem.  Tonight, there is a bizarre story out of Citrus County. 
[01:55:30]  A man is in jail for trying to get another man to help him commit murder.  But investigators end up finding out something even more shocking.  They say the suspect wanted to have sex with a corpse.  Fox 13's Jim Hill reports.  The bizarre plot started to unfold inside this house.  Citrus County deputies say Kevin Wade Daly was behind it.  He's accused of trying to recruit someone to commit murder.  But detectives say even more shocking was Daly's motive.  Homosexual necrophilia is what the purpose was. 
[01:56:00]  There were going to be sex acts committed on a male corpse.  Homosexual necrophilia.  How do you...  That would be a great band name.  Wow.  What?  As you said that, I was thinking that would be a good band name.  That's creepy.  Great minds think alike.  Yeah.  No, that's really just creepy.  Yeah, so do gay people apparently.  How did that come out, by the way?  Like, at what point did the other guy bail out? 
[01:56:30]  When he goes, look, I'd like you to help me kill this guy.  And he went, all right, so I can have sex with him.  No.  Investigators say Daly even revealed that his intended victim was a man from Homosassa  who was doing homo-watching work in his neighborhood.  He actually came up with his name and his place of business and actually called the man's place  of business on the prospect of saying what a good job he had done.  Daly's neighbors couldn't believe it. 
[01:57:00]  It's scary.  I can't believe it.  I have a daughter here, too.  I was glad that he didn't get to really know him on a personal level to invite him into our home.  They're thankful he's behind bars.  He could have murdered me over there in his backyard.  We can sleep a lot easier knowing that he's not in the door.  You're a woman.  I'm glad he's going to feast.  I mean, we don't need that kind of tooth.  That's scary.  Real scary.  Don't need that kind of tooth.  Don't need that kind of neighbor. 
[01:57:30]  And what makes you think you're going to get a guy to help you do that?  I don't know.  That's a good question, Jeremy.  There was a story a while ago about three friends, and one guy looked in the obituary,  and he saw a cheerleader or one of the girls that he knew.  Yeah, she died in a motorcycle accident, and he got two of his friends to help dig her up  because he wanted to have sex with her.  And he told his friends, look, I want to dig her up to have sex with her.  And they started digging, and the cops showed up.  And then the friends quickly ratted him out. 
[01:58:00]  Hey, it's not me.  It was just digging.  And he's the one that wanted to have sex with her.  Which one?  It was the naked guy with the condom and the shovel.  The man's just nude.  He's got no pants, just socks and a shovel.  Eagerly awaiting the creaky opening of the casket.  My God.  They're trying to crack the casket, but he's warming up over there.  Ooh, it's cold.  This never works in the cold.  Looks like a mushroom cap.  It's a hell of a friend, though.  It's going to help you with your fantasy. 
[01:58:30]  Fluffing with a dead possum.  Oh, that's disgusting.  I don't know.  There would be something really, really creepy about that.  I know that kind of sounds obvious, but when you really think about it, you don't even want  to be in the same room as a dead person.  There's just some kind of weird vibe they give off, you know?  And then you think of hopping aboard.  I think of the last couple of wakes I've gone to, I just, I mean, one was an uncle, so that 
[01:59:00]  wouldn't count.  No.  One was a female friend, and I just can't imagine looking at a body and thinking it's,  I can't.  And that's where, yeah.  Especially one that's already been buried.  I'm not saying that I can get it in the coroner's office, but at least if he hasn't sliced  her open yet.  You know, maybe if someone died, they don't get sliced open.  Yeah, that's why I think these people that work in that line of work, they just kind  of get desensitized to it, and they kind of go into it maybe for that, and then after 
[01:59:30]  a while, they work up the nerve, because they're desensitized.  It's not a body like we think of, oh my God, you know, it's a product to them.  It's something to move from an upstairs room to the morgue, and then before you slide it  in that cold refrigerator, you knock off a little piece.  All right.  Prop it up, and everybody says Hail Mary's next to it.  You can throw it in the dirt, throw crap on it, and say, all right, next.  We have to take a little break when we get back, because it's been an intense day for 
[02:00:00]  everybody.  Yeah.  Oh.  We got Roland singing Sunshine Day.  Oh.  Wow.  That should help everybody out.  It certainly will.  And we'll also get together a little, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  If you got one, 877-212-O-N-A.  Opie and Anthony here. 
[02:00:30]  Thanks for checking us out.  Wow.  We greatly appreciate that.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony show in a few minutes here.  Jesus H. Christ.  We've got a picture of Danny Bonaduce naked in front of us.  Wow.  Is he naked?  I thought he was just holding a small turtle.  That was Jim Norton who said that, Danny.  I think you're hung like a horse myself.  You're a seahorse.  That was Jim Norton, Danny Bonaduce.  I'm not stupid. 
[02:01:00]  I'm not going toe-to-toe with that animal.  I wouldn't even care if he'd beat me up after that.  All I'd do was laugh at his penis as he hit me.  At least if you went toe-to-toe, you'd know nothing else would hit you.  That was Anthony Cumia, one half of the Opie and Anthony show.  I think you're hung like a horse, Danny.  This guy's in great shape.  I've got to say one thing.  There's a naked picture of him profiled, and he's reaching for something.  You can see his abs and the little...  When you lift your arm, what is that under there?  It's called a muscle, Jim.  It's all muscular, yeah.  It's just called some kind of muscle. 
[02:01:30]  I'll tell you what's not called a muscle.  That extra thumb God gave him.  God gave him an extra thumb.  That is an awful picture.  Why is he naked?  I don't know.  I wouldn't even shower naked if that was me.  That is a horribly small, awful...  E-Rock, where's that picture?  Yeah, you don't know, huh?  I think it was part of some award show.  It's just breaking now, hitting the internet.  They give an award for what?  Smallest one on an adult male?  For the third year running is? 
[02:02:00]  There's nothing, just a bunch of uggs and ewes, and what the F is that?  I'm showing the PalTalk audience, and they're commenting, mutilated junk.  It really is amazing.  We'll try to get more info on that.  You know what it looks like?  Picture a cocktail Frank on a beanbag chair.  I'd have higher hopes for that one.  Yes, it's Danny Bonaduce, naked.  All right.  Hey, we got... 
[02:02:30]  That is horrible.  I don't want to lose Lori.  Lori puts makeup on dead people.  Lori, what's up?  Well, actually, I was listening to you guys, and I didn't want to call in, but I just had  to, because I have the same sense of humor that you guys do.  So, I put makeup on dead people.  I get a couple of pictures, and, you know, I go in a few times, and at the morgue I work  at, there's a couple of interns, and one of them is, like, the weird Dungeons and Dragons  type of guy.  You know, he colors his hair black and all that. 
[02:03:00]  Well, I came in one night.  It was the night before our funeral.  You know, she was all dressed up.  It was a maybe 60-year-old woman.  And I had just finished her makeup, and, you know, we use airbrush, so I was airbrushing  her.  I came in a little later than I was supposed to, and I walked in on the Dungeons and Dragons  guy, performing fellatio on the woman that I had just finished putting the makeup on.  Well, wait a minute.  Well, it wouldn't be fellatio.  That doesn't work.  That doesn't work.  You're thinking of the other thing. 
[02:03:30]  Let's just say this.  We have to say it a certain way.  You walk back in, and the guy you were with was doing something to this woman that she probably  would have enjoyed when she was alive.  Exactly.  You really saw this?  What happened to the guy?  Well, I sort of backed out, like, really quietly.  Like, it was one of those shocking things, and I backed up really quietly, and I ended  up calling the guy who I worked for, and I tried to explain it to him, like, as discreetly  as possible.  I guess they did a few investigations on him, and he ended up being terminated. 
[02:04:00]  I guess it was sort of hush-hush type of thing.  It was disgusting.  I didn't know what, I mean, what, how do you deal with something like that when you  walk in on it?  It was so gross.  Wow.  So, I just needed to call and tell you guys that, because it freaked me out, and it was  perfect for you guys today.  Why would you accept a job where you put makeup on dead people?  Yeah, couldn't you, like, find where, like, live people? 
[02:04:30]  You know, movie set, things like that.  I do that, too, but it's like $1,500 to $2,000 per court, so.  So, it pays well.  Do you ever get, do you ever get creeped out?  A lot of the times, yeah.  The first time I did it, it was, I fainted.  I mean, just seeing them, and, you know, they're already cut open, so they have the big why,  and it's, you know, you have to put makeup, like, you know, especially if they're wearing,  like, a lower collared shirt for the funeral.  You know, you got to put lower collared shirt, what, showing off, what, a low cut number, 
[02:05:00]  something sexy.  Aren't we just about done with open caskets, by the way?  I know the older generation, they still think that's the way to go, but, you know, the newer  generations are, like, enough with that creepy open casket crap.  It's mostly the older women, you know, or the older, the baby boomers, or whatever.  You know, she, the woman that, you know, I just saw that, she was, like, 50-something  or 60, and, I mean, she wasn't, like, anything young and hot. 
[02:05:30]  I'll tell you what, it was pretty gross.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  I want to thank Electric Eel for this fine guest to the Opie and Anthony show.  Lingy-longy!  Wow, that's a hell of a story there, Lori.  How long have you been doing it?  I'm going on three years now.  Three years putting makeup on dead people.  Look how they massacred my boy.  You ever have to really patch someone up?  Yeah, there's been a couple of them.  Serious bruising and stuff from the bodies not being properly taken care of. 
[02:06:00]  What about, like, bullet wounds, anything like that, where you've got to use spackle?  No, I haven't seen any of that.  No, huh?  Hey, do you ever put makeup on dead people while you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  Usually, yep.  Sometimes I'm there really early in the morning, so you guys are always on.  Can you call us next time you have a body?  Creepy.  Of course.  Would you put the phone next to the dead person's head so we could tease him?  I want to see if this show would make a dead person laugh. 
[02:06:30]  I was going to say, ha, ha, you're dead.  Exactly.  Get up.  I dare you.  I didn't think so.  Lori, I'm serious.  Call us the next time you're working on a body as our show is on.  Okay, I will.  I want to hear you go through the process, like, explain what you're doing and stuff.  You don't have to give the person's name or any real details about the person.  It's all about you and what you're doing.  Do you think they really look like they're supposed to when you're done?  Well, we get a couple of pictures.  You know, I have usually two or three pictures, and I have to match up, you know. 
[02:07:00]  When they die, they harden up.  So, I mean, I have to sort of make, you know, contours in the face.  So, you've got to, like, superimpose in, like, contours with some kind of shading and stuff.  Right.  The creepiest thing is when the relatives request them to be smiling.  Get out of here.  Smiling?  How do you pull that off?  I have to use makeup, and I use airbrushing.  A hanger like the Joker.  Just give him a big Joker smile.  Yeah, but how do you move the smile into place? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  I don't move it.  I just use makeup.  It's all an illusion.  Just use makeup for a little smile.  When you curl up on dead lips a little, so it looks like, hi, I'm dead, but I'm feeling okay.  I'm all right.  I'm smiling.  That's funny.  Why don't you just put, like, his hand like he's saluting, like a wink?  How about a wink?  Or one eyebrow up, like he's thinking, hmm.  Yeah, I'm in a casket.  Laurie, we could talk to you for a while, but we're running out of show, so you've got to call us back, okay?  All right, I will.  Next time you're working on a body, please call the show. 
[02:08:00]  Please, please, please.  New friend of the show.  All right, screw Marge.  We have Laurie.  Yeah.  That's right.  The makeup artist for dead people.  Thank you, Laurie.  Laurie deals with them after they're dead.  She doesn't lead them to their deaths.  Yeah.  Hey, get rolling.  He's going to do a little sing-along as we leave today.  Jesse, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  I just wanted to give you a little bit of what I learned today.  Sure.  I learned that if you eat mayo and drink iced tea for 29 years, your parents may be shopping for a very large coffin.  Oh, I'm guessing.  Sorry with that fresh talk to Eric. 
[02:08:30]  I think Iraq will be just fine.  Ronnie, West Palm Beach, Florida.  What's up, Ronnie?  Hey, good morning, ONA.  Hey.  And Jimmy, I've seen you a while back, dude.  You killed him.  Thank you, buddy.  Great job.  In Cucamonga.  Hey.  It's from a cartoon.  Oh.  Yeah.  Go ahead, sir.  Let's go, Ronnie.  Okay, am I going to be able to pick you guys up anywhere down here?  What happened, Don?  Why are you guys off the air?  Oh, boy.  More of this.  West Palm, we'll try to figure out a new station, but there's many ways to listen to our show as we move forward. 
[02:09:00]  Cody, Indiana, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I got a pat from Munaki, what I learned today.  All right.  Hi, Thomas.  I learned that pending some test results, sex bagels might be toast.  That's a pretty good pat from Munaki.  Good pat impression.  Sorry about Chicago, guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  We liked the people that we're listening in Chicago, too.  They seemed to be a cool bunch.  Yeah.  And they were just a bunch, unfortunately.  They were a cool handful.  No wonder Bonaduce is a violent nutbag. 
[02:09:30]  Well, yeah.  I said that, too, man.  Yeah.  During the break.  Anthony Long Island, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Just want to let you know I learned today that Marge's Clam is between 405 and 410 years old.  Good one.  Combining a bunch of stories today.  That's good.  Don Trucker, go.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Today I learned that the AIDS makes you glow green.  Yeah, we did learn that.  First case of AIDS came to America in 1969.  That's what we're learning today. 
[02:10:00]  Roland, you ready?  It's been an intense day for a lot of people, and we want you to bring everyone back together  with a happy, sunshiny type of song.  This is such a happy song.  All right.  It's Brady Kids.  All right.  You know it?  Sort of.  All right.  Here we go.  You ready, Roland?  You're going to sing us out today.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I think I'll go for a walk outside.  Now the summer sun's calling my name. 
[02:10:30]  I just can't stay inside all day.  Got to get out.  Give me some of those rays.  Hey, everybody's smiling.  Shine day.  Everybody's laughing.  Sunshine day.  Everybody seems so happy today.  It's a sunshine day.  I walk outside.  Now the summer sun knows if I met me.  He's calling me. 
[02:11:00]  I got to get out.  No, wait.  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Into a sunshine day.  Can't you dig the sunshine?  Now it's but the same.  Can you hear me calling your name?  Oh.  Bring it on home.  Come on.  Let's go.  Oh, I think I'll take a walk every day.  Now the summer sun has showed the way to be happy now. 
[02:11:30]  I just can't stay inside all day.  I got to get out.  Give me some of those rays.  Energy.  Let's go.  Everybody's smiling.  Shine day.  Everybody's laughing.  Sunshine day.  Everybody seems so happy today.  It's a sunshine.  It's a sunshine day.  Can you dig the sunshine?  Oh, come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it sounds the same.  Can't you hear me calling your name? 
[02:12:00]  Hold the note.  I go for a walk outside now.  The summer's calling my name.  I just can't stay inside all day.  I got to get out.  Give me some of those rays.  Everybody's smiling.  Sunshine day.  Everybody laughing.  Sunshine day.  Everybody seems so happy today. 
[02:12:30]  It's a sunshine day.  Smiling sunshine day.  Everybody's sunshine day.  Everybody seems so happy today.  Wow.  I hope that brought everybody a smile today.  After that one, I want to say goodbye to Boston, Maine, New York, Syracuse, and the rest.  Hey, if you're still listening, you deserve to know what tomorrow's sound is for the $1,000.  Listen for this.  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[02:13:00]  We'll play between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow, and you'll have a chance to win $1,000 if you're...  Well, you will win the $1,000.  Yeah, the 10th caller.  All right, well, have a sunshine day.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  It's showtime.  Quack, quack, quack. 
[02:13:30]  Barry Bonds...  What happened?  Barry Bonds has filed for free agency.  I hope the Yankees grab him.  I've let the Yankees grab him for a couple years.  Would you?  Yeah, just for him to retire a Yankee.  That's silly.  No, that would just be nice, though, to enjoy San Francisco.  Don't mind the creaking.  That's better.  Got it down like this so I can see... 
[02:14:00]  See people.  I don't know if people are buying tickets for my show in Queensbury.  They're not.  I hope they are.  Of course they are.  This Friday and Saturday.  I have no plans in going, and I bought tickets.  What's that fucking place?  I don't remember.  Oh, it's St. Basil's.  Or Tea Basil's.  Sweet Basil restaurant.  Or Sweet Basil Tee's.  Sweet Basil restaurant.  I think it's the SaratogaComedyClub.com.  Yeah.  There's a very small room.  Three different names I've heard so far.  I just fucking...  It's a nightmare.  Call it the fucking Comedy Club. 
[02:14:30]  The fucking ComedyClub.com.  Fuck Sweet Basil.  Fuck Sweet Basil on his mouth.  That's the stupid restaurant name.  SaratogaComedyClub.com.  That's the sweet basil restaurant.  What's the name of this fucking shithole?  It's in Queensbury.  Queensbury.  Can I get an Eric Logan on the phone today, please?  Eric Logan?  Why would we want to have Eric Logan on the phone?  Get that.  Because Congress approved the merger today. 
[02:15:00]  Did they really?  They did.  So that's a big, big step in the merger talks.  Good.  Excellent.  Boy, they were so dead set against it when this ball first started rolling.  I'd love to know what the behind-the-scenes shenanigans that went on.  You got to say, Mel is a smart guy.  And when he was pushing for the merger, I'm like, I can't picture him betting on a losing  horse, as it were.  Smart dude.  Supposedly, Congress has approved the merger. 
[02:15:30]  Now it's down to the FCC.  Who else?  Us.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, I believe, might have a say.  No?  Let me, uh, hold on.  Go ahead, talk.  I thought the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, might have a say in it.  I hope he's banging a keyboard like he just came over here in 1969 from Haiti.  Angry typing info.  He's giving the keyboard AIDS. 
[02:16:00]  So the, uh, yeah, so the government passes it.  But then you need the FCC.  Yeah.  And it looks like, uh, they're gonna pass it.  And then I would think, um, some kind of a, you know, Wall Street thing.  All right, let's see what it says here.  They have to, uh.  Let's see what it says over here.  Approve.  I'm gonna tell you what it says over here.  Over here.  Oh.  The much, uh, awaited approval is done, and they are urging the FCC and the DOJ.  The Department of Juxtasis. 
[02:16:30]  To also approve the merger.  I, too, think it is a good thing, and I know that many on this board do not agree.  There will be more diversity of persons.  Buzz, buzz, buzz.  All right.  You went to buzz, buzz pretty quick during that read.  Don't read me.  I want that.  I really do want it.  I didn't want it at first, but I want it now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Very much.  I didn't say after it's gone through.  Do you want to, uh, you know, share this studio with a few more people? 
[02:17:00]  I have no idea.  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  That's a good point.  I'm just saying that, but I bet.  That's a damn good point.  We're gonna have to share this.  Oh, whatever.  I wouldn't care.  All right.  Hey, this was a great story, and we didn't know how to do it on the other side, so we  do it over here.  Uh, creep cuts in on today.  Uh, NBC and producers of today got a little more than they bargained for when they set  up a media conference call with TV writers.  And today's anchors, Matt Lauer and, and Curry.  Matt Lauer.  And Al Roker.  So they're on a conference call, and, uh, they're doing a little interview for the 
[02:17:30]  media, media conference call with Matt Lauer and Curry and Al Roker to publicize the new  segment, The Ends of the Earth.  What's the Ends of the Earth?  Of course, Elo's in a budget meeting for an hour or so.  A budget meeting.  Oh, my God.  I can only imagine the horror.  Yes.  That must be a budget meeting.  He's trying to justify the alcohol expense in his account.  15,000?  Well, you know, I just...  15 large. 
[02:18:00]  There's a lot of thirsty friends.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Many empty mini bars.  Two.  The maid must have took it.  Damn, Tom Brady dimple.  Two.  Eric Logan.  Oh.  Budget meeting.  Sending a little, uh, meet.  A little text.  Or an email.  No, I'm emailing for my BlackBerry.  A BlackBerry, Matt.  We have Bill Donahue calling in at 10 a.m.  Bill Donahue, the head of the Catholic League. 
[02:18:30]  Could they make this keyboard any smaller?  Yes, they could.  But it would be really inconvenient because you wouldn't be able to type that easily, as  easily as you are right now.  And you know what I'm psyched about?  If it was smaller.  We have Slash coming in from Guns N' Roses on Thursday.  Is he?  And, uh, the book is good, man.  Yeah, I'm reading his book.  I'm...  Fuck.  Are we really?  Yeah, it's very good.  Fuck.  You wrote a good book.  You...  What are you writing?  You can't...  Don't write that to the boss.  You...  Don't write that to the boss.  We need the XM gig.  Fuck you and your...  Let's, uh... 
[02:19:00]  Let's not piss off the only guy who likes us.  Fuck you and your budget.  All right.  Let's get to some news stories here.  He's not gonna like that.  Gossip, uh...  Emailing...  I love gossip.  Me too.  I live for gossip.  I like to pretend I don't gossip.  Me neither.  But I'm a...  I'm a gossipy Gertie.  I fucking...  Hold on.  Let me just send this.  You can send it.  I live to gossip.  Dear Elo, fuck you and your...  Fucking... 
[02:19:30]  Fucking's better, right?  No.  And your fucking budget...  No, sir.  Fuck, I don't wanna be!  I wanna freaking N!  I think...  Yes, sir.  Double tap for N!  You're in a budget...  There should be a picture with N.  Of course you're in a budget meeting.  Fuck you and your budget meeting.  Send.  Oh, this is fucked up.  All right.  The McCanns are accused of using Madeline Fund to pay their mortgage.  Oh my God.  Is that the English... 
[02:20:00]  The cute little girl.  ...couple with the cute little girl that...  And the woman I'm in love with.  ...ended up missing?  And now they're using funds that the world...  Of course the world has been pouring money to these two...  ...to pay for their expenses to try to find this little girl.  ...and now they've paid their mortgage with it?  Well, maybe they're not working.  I'm gonna say...  Are they justifying it that way?  I'm assuming.  Maybe they haven't worked...  ...and they have no way they're gonna lose their home.  I mean, I don't mind that...  ...because if they're not working and they're looking for...  ...that's not like it's a vacation.  I mean, your mortgage is a pretty basic thing. 
[02:20:30]  You got two fucking kids, you're not working.  Well, when you've killed one...  ...it's nice if the people can pay...  ...for your mortgage.  I don't believe that happened...  ...because I'm in love with the mother.  She's so cute.  You like the mother in that?  No, I love.  A spokesman for the McCann family has refused to comment on allegations.  They used some of the Madeline fund to pay their mortgage.  The statement comes after the Daily Mail...  ...unbelievable paper, by the way.  Yes.  Any of those limey papers.  The Mirror, the Mail.  You always go to...  I always go online and click on some story that seems really outrageous... 
[02:21:00]  ...and it takes you over to London.  And then you read it in that paper and go,  ...oh, it's all lies.  Because they have raised over $2 million in public donations to help find her.  $2 million.  But yeah, they're using...  They're not using it for their legal fees, but they are using it, I think, for their mortgage.  Wouldn't you be using it maybe to...  First of all, you sell your house.  You get rid of it.  Then you take all the money.  Too many bad memories. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  You take all the money, and then you find your kid.  You scour the globe with the money looking for your kid.  The kid is probably in a ditch somewhere dead.  Yeah, they know where the kid is because they put the kid there.  And they also have two other kids that they have to provide for.  Let's just say that they didn't do it.  Two other kids to kill?  Yeah, they have two other kids to...  No, the mother wouldn't have done that.  She's too nice.  You really are in love with this mother.  Yes, I am.  And you don't think she did it.  I know she didn't. 
[02:22:00]  If she was an ugly hag, you'd be going,  they ought to hang this bitch for killing her daughter.  Guilty slob.  But the fact that she's cute...  Here's the rule of thumb.  Cute ladies didn't do it.  Cute ladies don't murder.  Susan Smith was ugly.  Louise Woodward was ugly.  Fucking Andrea Yates was ugly.  They did it.  Of course they did.  They're ugly.  What about girls, women, young women that have sex with students,  and they're ugly.  They go to jail, and then you get the hot one, 
[02:22:30]  and she didn't even see a day in jail.  Yeah, but at least she admitted that she fucking...  She took the dick.  At least we know she took the young cock  and molded it around her older beautiful badge.  Everyone knows that was a gift to the boy.  To the boy?  To the boy.  This woman did not do this.  Certainly must have been.  Okay, that's what Jimmy's saying there.  What happened to my story that I started?  What story did you start?  The creep cuts in on today.  That wasn't the end of the story, period.  They're my stories.  It gets way better. 
[02:23:00]  NBC and producers of today got a little more than they bargained for  when they set up a media conference call with TV writers and today anchors,  Matt Lauer and Kerry and Al Roker,  to publicize a new segment, The Ends of the Earth.  The Ends of the Earth.  Featuring Al Roker.  According to our spies,  one filthy-mouthed prankster got on the recent conference call.  Uh-oh.  I wonder if it was one of our guys or one of his guys.  There's pretty much only two choices at this point. 
[02:23:30]  In which writers could quiz Lauer, Roker, and Kerry  about their upcoming trips to Greenland, Antarctica, and the equator.  And this guy interrupted the proceedings to ask Kerry,  good old Aunt Kerry, this question.  Did you get your last name because your blank smells like Mediterranean food?  And by blank, I guess he meant the old pussy.  He asked if her box smells like Mediterranean food.  Wow.  I have a feeling he went with the C word, though. 
[02:24:00]  I have a feeling he went with the C word.  What was her answer?  One source said the prankster was immediately dropped from the call,  but somehow he got back on the call using another name.  The lewd interloper then asked Lauer,  can you blank your own blank?  Can you fuck your own mouth or ass?  Suck your own dick.  Can you suck your own dick?  Can you suck your own...  Wait, wait.  Can you bleep your own bleep?  Could be can you suck your own dick or can you fuck your own ass?  Fuck your own ass or fuck your own mouth, which is funny, too. 
[02:24:30]  I'm going to go with suck your own...  Oh, is that good?  I know what it was.  Could you make your own lunch?  No.  Can you...  Sid, I can smell your cunt.  And it smells like hummus.  With that, the conference call was shut down.  An NBC insider said no one knows who he was or how he got the number in the first place.  As for how Lauer and Curry reacted to the vulgarities,  the NBC source said they were fine with it.  A rep for today declined to comment.  Of course, they were fine with it. 
[02:25:00]  What are they going to do?  Yes.  Because around the newsroom, they call Ann Curry,  old falafel pussy.  That's common knowledge.  The cunt smells like a fucking gyro.  Wow.  You actually made them stop their little press conference, huh?  Yes.  Good.  I don't care about them anyway.  Fat fucking old stomach stapled a question.  I wish we had audio.  Ow.  Careful.  This ain't good.  Ooh.  That hooked you.  Oh, my God.  I'll rip an ear off.  I almost lost my ear. 
[02:25:30]  I'm watching the news.  Must be your ear?  Peter Boyle and Gene Wilder dancing from Young Frankenstein.  Young Frankenstein.  What a funny movie.  Yeah.  And now Lon Chaney, Chaney into the Werewolf.  Oh, it's a Halloween-themed thing.  I have a rod.  Do you know that?  I thought it was our show this morning.  Over at CBS.  Oh, boy.  Was she fucking...  Wow.  I hear she is really livid.  Yeah, is she?  Super pissed.  Listen to me.  I like Tracy.  I think we all like Tracy.  She was wrong. 
[02:26:00]  When you fucking get guys outside and you're walking out and the first thing you say is,  I hope tomorrow's not going to be.  How do you expect people to not react angrily to that?  Yeah.  How do you expect that's not helpful?  And then to come into the studio during the show and reiterate...  You want to deal with...  That's a little rough.  ...content.  I understand that you're not a lawyer.  I know she's all for it.  But how about this?  Keep fighting for us to be able to say Oriental on the fucking radio.  And again, I know that's not Tracy's call. 
[02:26:30]  That's the content help we need, not what we talk about.  Right.  I don't think we need help there.  Oriental shouldn't be an instant bleep word.  It should depend on context.  Now, the ratings problems, are they because we talk too much about other stations or because  they want us to compete in a mail market and they've cut our balls off and said, here's  your fucking tampons, now go have fun.  Ooh.  It does sound like fun though, Jimmy.  Of course it does.  Cutting each other's balls off, shoving tampons in where your balls used to be.  That's right.  And you still got a bigger cock than Danny Bonaduce. 
[02:27:00]  Jesus, Danny.  No wonder you're so fucking angry.  Yeah, that's...  I'd learn karate too if I had that fucking nub.  That has to be so embarrassing if somebody, you get a phone call, like how does it happen?  Are you just checking the web, checking your name on the internet and then, oh fuck, there's  a naked picture and you look and go, oh my God, I got needle dick.  It looks like a dresser drawer knob.  I want to pull his cock out and grab socks. 
[02:27:30]  A kitchen cabinet.  Yeah.  Can I pull your dick out and get a spoon?  I'm hungry.  What the fuck is that?  We know where the picture came from yet?  I don't know.  I'm guessing Highlights or some other child's magazine.  Something pedophiles like.  Small dick monthly.  Exactly.  He's the centerfold fucking October through July.  Or you can go to PerezHilton.com for the picture.  There you go.  That's almost not even...  That wouldn't even be considered vulgar.  He looks like a mannequin with a big bag. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, just his big bag and a little thumb-like dick sticking straight out.  Like a baby turtle fucking peeking.  Like a scared turtle peeking out of its shell.  Barely.  All right.  Hey, we're going to get another play out of this today.  This was just terrific from earlier.  609 is the time.  We love emails.  Good morning at news10.net.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  No, that's sad.  That was good.  Oh, my God.  That was good.  You got me.  You got me.  Oh, my God.  That was good, you guys.  Oh, my God.  Are you ready?  No.  No.  And the video's up on opandanthony.com, so.  You know what would have been funny if someone got really scared because they were on live  TV?  Can you play that again if one of the anchors was like this?  Live TV.  Yeah.  They're doing their thing.  Yes.  And then, like, scary people came running onto the set.  I'm one of the anchors. 
[02:29:00]  609 is the time.  We love emails.  Good morning at news10.net.  You murdering cunt.  Oh, you murdering cunt with a knife.  Oh, you motherfucker.  Oh, you murdering cunt with a knife.  Oh, you murdering cunt with a knife.  Just blurting out horrific shit.  Oh, jeez.  How did they know they weren't just going to go, fuck?  Regular TV.  Want to try another one, Jimmy?  Um, no, because the other one I have got us in big trouble.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:29:30]  Even here.  I thought of it.  I have the image in my head.  I could hear your voice saying it.  Me too.  Oh, the video is funny.  The video is great.  It's up on opianathlete.com.  And then this is how it played out.  You're on the end.  Monica and Melissa, or Melonica, if you like to call them.  Melonica, do you believe?  Well, you couldn't see.  You just heard a scream behind you.  Yeah.  And Melissa, you saw them running in?  What?  Yeah.  This is a rare one. 
[02:30:00]  I apologize.  I do scream quite loud on, like, roller coasters and stuff.  People don't like to go on with me.  You know what?  I have to apologize as well.  All right.  Do you?  Really let off the party.  Shut up.  We'll apologize.  Don't do it next time, bitch.  No.  Oh, my goodness.  We'll apologize.  That fucking uterus you have makes you frightened all the time.  And I'm sorry.  I just get scared on roller coasters.  What else scares you, bitch?  It's all about you.  Who fucking cares? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  I get scared when a Negro comes into my room with a hammer and a ski mask.  I get scared on roller coasters.  I get scared when people I've slept with come down with AIDS.  I get scared when dogs are barking at my pussy.  All right.  Forget it.  You're a fucking rabbit.  Can't even go see Saw, because that scares the hell out of me.  It's endless.  And I got scared of the exorcist.  I have to apologize, too.  Because of the accident of my birth, I have this funny hole between my legs, which causes  me to scream a lot. 
[02:31:00]  Don't forget the shining after five minutes.  I had to turn that off.  Except when Scatman got killed.  I said, get out of the way, you you know what.  Oh, I can't say that on TV.  I get scared on roller coasters.  I have to apologize.  I have to.  And the other one, I have to apologize, too, because that might be the proper thing to  do.  And if you're doing it, I'm not doing it.  I might get fired.  And you, you know, everyone apologized.  And the guy apologized.  Hey, I'm sorry for these two silly holes. 
[02:31:30]  You know how they get.  I pull up a fist and I go crazy.  Back after this.  You know?  And then we got this, speaking of media news, we got this fine little story.  A record spinner is now a record breaker.  Indianapolis DJ Matt Albrod stayed on the air for more than 136 uninterrupted hours.  How did he do that?  He went five and a half days without sleep.  A lot of free bird, I bet you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  A lot of free bird, I bet you.  A lot of free bird, I bet you.  No, who I would bang?  Lauren Hutton.  Lauren Hutton doesn't have sex.  But look at her.  She does look pretty good.  She's in her 60s.  She's asexual.  For the people that think banging a six-year-old is gross, look at that.  How is Lauren Hutton really looking up?  She does look good, though, for her age.  She was very sexy in American Gigolo.  She was the older woman, 1980, with Richard Gere. 
[02:32:30]  As the older woman in 1980?  Yes.  Holy shit.  All right, maybe I wouldn't know.  No, no, no.  She was the older woman.  But look, it's high-def TV.  She's looking real good.  Do you even understand what the fuck kind of horror show is going on under those clothes?  Do you even get that they put makeup and stuff and you can see the neck starting?  Look at that picture of Lauren Hutton.  There is a world of hurt.  You wouldn't go there.  You want to grab her calves and have two handfuls of varicose veins as you spread her legs apart 
[02:33:00]  so you can look at some cottage cheese where the primary target is.  I think she's still pretty, though, man.  No.  Yes.  No.  She's going to be 64 in November.  I like the gap in her teeth.  64.  You just want to fill it?  I like that little gap.  I want to spackle it with a fucking log.  Not even a load.  Just a log of shit on a spackle.  That fucking thing between her old lady teeth.  Get that fixed, Alfred E. Newman. 
[02:33:30]  With a fucking meat pocket.  Be able to cover a mad magazine being assaulted by a gang.  I mean, she looks good on television here.  But that's a far cry from, you know, hopping in the sack.  She's looking great.  That's having a look at that.  High-def.  Diane Sawyer doesn't look that good on the high-def.  Look how fat fucking Al Roker's getting.  Oh, he's awful.  Good.  Good, you pig.  He has fucking, he has leg arms.  Look, look at how wide he is.  Look at his fucking ass. 
[02:34:00]  Wow, what happened to him?  He got fat.  He couldn't fucking take it anymore.  All the accolades went away of everyone going,  Oh, Al, you look great.  You look great.  And that started going away, so he had to start eating more.  All right.  By the end of the show, I'm going to give you my top five women over 60 I would have  sex with.  Fair enough.  I'm going to go with Lauren Hutton.  Yes.  Someone is suggesting Martha Stewart.  I wouldn't do Martha Stewart.  Here's what you do with Martha Stewart.  I'm thinking Diane Sawyer.  I'm just smelling baby powder and fucking piss.  I might have to put Diane Sawyer on my top five women over 60 to have sex with. 
[02:34:30]  And dentures, bruh.  Diane Sawyer.  I might.  I'm not positive.  Number one is definitely Lauren Hutton.  Look at that.  Getting bit by a snake.  Who wants dentures, bruh?  You know what you do with Martha Stewart?  You lay her on her back and you set your asshole on her mouth and you just jerk off onto her  fucking awful sock tits.  You fucking spit your asshole on her mouth and fucking just scrap onto those fucking wrinkled 
[02:35:00]  knees with nipples she has.  Fucking never fuck her.  Or then you cut a gas right in her fucking tan or boil hairdo.  You fart right in her forehead and watch her hair go flark.  Jesus.  All right.  Help me out of here.  Goddamn.  Is Annette Bening over 60?  Annette Bening.  I want to look into that one.  I want to look into Raquel Welch.  I want to look into Sophia Loren.  Jane Fonda. 
[02:35:30]  Anne Margaret.  Would you fuck Anne Margaret?  Just because she fucked Elvis, I probably would.  Anne Margaret maybe?  I would.  Just had a respect for Elvis.  Yeah.  Oh, there's Al Roker again.  Boy, that fucking is there.  Mrs. C.  Oh, Marion Ross?  From Happy Days.  What is she, 80 now?  I'd like to fuck her, but with something.  Not like, not with my dick.  I'd insert an object into Marion Ross.  Maybe a Fonzie doll.  I'd fuck her with like one of those big 12-inch Fonzie dolls in the 70s.  Hey.  Hey.  The thumbs hurt going in because she's so dry. 
[02:36:00]  Would you have sex with her with an extender?  I'd have to.  My fucking cock would look like Danny Bonaduce's in the refrigerator.  I couldn't get it from Marion Ross.  A Sunday Monday?  What kind of show starts with a fucking jukebox?  Like, that was the whole thing.  It was a jukebox and a shitty spinning record.  And we watched every week, didn't we?  Well, the spinning record kind of turned into a hole.  Yeah.  And then you'd see their faces in it.  Exactly.  And they'd do those, like, kind of look and smile and nod their head. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And then Anson Williams should have said, this is where I'll be living after Happy Day  since I'll never get hired acting again.  And Donnie Most was in there with him.  Yeah.  Dope.  Sophia Loren is 73.  Oh, boy.  73.  I can't put her on my top five.  Who used to be called the fucking, like, the pussy cat?  The, uh, what was her name?  Eartha Kitt?  No, no, no.  Not Catwoman.  Black don't crack, so I might have to go with Eartha Kitt.  No, she was French, I think. 
[02:37:00]  I just don't want to see her name.  Okay.  Okay.  Jacques Chirac?  Jacques Chirac.  No.  Jane Seymour is just under.  No.  I'm looking.  Now I'm waiting for somebody to come up with the answer.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  No.  Jane Seymour.  Fuck Jane Seymour.  Bridget Bardot.  How about Angie Dickinson?  How old is she?  Bridget Bardot or Angie Dickinson.  Anybody out there have an older lady you wouldn't mind fucking? 
[02:37:30]  I would like to hear from listeners.  Maybe they have some older people.  Would you fuck Charo?  Charo.  Coochie.  Coochie.  Coochie.  I might go with Dolly Parton.  No.  I heard Pryor fuck her, though.  Just kidding.  Fuck Dolly Parton?  That's what Paul Mooney said.  Yeah, he said that Richard fucked her right here.  Paul Mooney probably fucking says, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd say it makes me like days to work together.  Just that a black guy would fuck such a, like, a white woman.  Paul Mooney would love to get that fucking illusion out there. 
[02:38:00]  I believe it.  Paul Mooney's a racist.  Probably, but I think with a Pryor story like that, it's probably the truth.  I don't know.  Someone, you know what?  Someone told me he related.  How did he say it?  Um, well, Richard fucked her.  I mean, Richard, uh, y'all motherfuckers, don't you do it?  I love that one.  That's a great Paul Mooney.  I can't do anything.  I can just do it with, like, a little mannerism.  I can hold in the Chardonnay.  No, you got the queen.  You got the voice.  Mannerisms.  Charles, either 56 or 66.  It's disputed on Wikipedia.  Holy shit.  That's amazing.  Who is she? 
[02:38:30]  Greg Opie Hughes?  66.  Does she have fruit on her head?  I might be right at someone to my list.  Linda Carter.  How old is she?  Oh, yes.  Linda Carter.  I'm going to guess 58.  I'll put her at exactly 60.  No.  Linda Carter.  If she's over 60, I'm in.  56.  Fuck.  I was two years older.  Maybe this is...  She must hate me for saying that.  Maybe this is tougher than I thought.  How about from 50?  It's a tough one.  You got, like, there are post-it notes in front of you with names on it, and now you got  this frustrated look.  Because I'm like...  How about this?  Angela Lansbury. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Angela Lansbury.  I wouldn't...  You know what I would do to Angela Lansbury?  I would just let her...  I would fucking...  I would sit her up, and I'd stand in front of her with my hands on my hips like a superhero.  Yeah.  And I'd let her jerk me off onto her own face while I told her how much her show sucked.  Jimmy?  This was supposed to be...  This was supposed to be a little fun.  I'm just telling you.  I'm going to have a little fun.  Over 60.  All right.  Well, Sophia Loren, 73. 
[02:39:30]  How old's Raquel Welch?  Oh, she's got to be fucking 70.  Get me a current picture of Raquel.  I'll study that one.  Cher?  Of course, Cher.  Yeah, Cher.  You're right.  Cher, how old is she?  She's not 60 yet, is she?  Yes.  67, I'm just trying to...  67, Raquel Welch?  All right, I'm going to add her to my list for now, but I might be able...  I might have to scratch her off.  Yeah, too old, because she'd want to kiss you.  Raquel Welch.  What about golf ball-eyed Susan Sarandon?  She's not 60 yet, is she?  I couldn't fuck her because of her politics. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, then you fuck her in the ass.  That's true.  Flip her over and write in the shitter.  And then fucking ass to mouth.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, then come in her mouth and just yell Bush's name.  Lonnie Anderson, 62.  Yes.  62 for Lonnie Anderson.  He was never into that plastic-looking...  Let me tell you something about Lonnie Anderson.  Always hated her cleavage.  It was...  There was something about it.  Yeah.  I don't like cleavage that kind of...  Kind of like...  It bows out.  It bows out, right.  Yeah, you got like...  And then comes back together.  Cleavage at the top, a little bit. 
[02:40:30]  Like, take two water balloons and just kind of...  Yeah.  And then it kind of...  It kind of bows out and then comes back in.  It starts with like a millimeter of cleavage and then it goes out...  Out and then comes back together.  And then comes back to cleavage.  That type of cleavage has always driven me nuts.  Susan Sarandon is 61.  She is 61, so she would fit in there.  You can tell though she has bad breath.  You think so?  Yeah, you can tell.  Interesting.  I watched Rescue Me and I can tell from some of the kissing scenes she was going out with  one of the young firemen and you can tell there was a bad breath thing going on there. 
[02:41:00]  It probably smells like...  She probably has rotting gums.  No, it probably smells like dry because she talks so much and coffee.  It probably smells like coffee and just like that dry stink someone gets when they talk  about politics all day.  I'm telling you, I think Lauren Hutton is in a class by herself at this point.  Hey, Jason, what's up?  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  What about when you already shot down Marlinda Carter?  She's not old enough.  What about Jane Seymour?  How many times do I have to say, fuck Jane Seymour? 
[02:41:30]  Fuck her!  And not in a good way.  Bernadette Peters?  I don't know.  Bernadette Peters, anyone.  I'd like to put her in a tub and sing I'm picking out a thermos for you and then drop  a toaster in there that's plugged in.  Let me tell you what I say about, fuck Annie, get your gun, eat shit.  Let me take a look at a couple people.  Hillary Clinton's 60, no.  No.  Let's go with...  Hillary Clinton's 85, she's only 60?  I'm going to take a look at a couple... 
[02:42:00]  Diane Keaton is a lesbian.  I think, anyway.  What, did fucking Hillary go for wrinkle implants?  Let's go with...  Let's see how old Goldie Hawn is.  I'll go with that.  61.  Oh, well, you'd fuck her?  Yeah, 61, yeah.  And Beverly D'Angelo.  Beverly D'Angelo, I would put at 58 years old.  Oh, shit.  That's a tough list.  But she had quite the set of tits in the vacation movies.  Wasn't Pacino's woman, right?  How old is Beverly D'Angelo, man? 
[02:42:30]  She's 55.  Oh, again, she's going to hate me.  I put her at three years older than she is.  Any of the Charlie Angels broads, are any of them 60 yet?  Oh, gotta be.  How about Betty White?  Farrah.  Farrah.  Farrah.  Did you fuck Farrah?  Sure.  Isn't she sick with cancer, though?  She's really fucked up.  I don't know.  I think she got better.  She's exactly 60.  Yeah, I'd fuck Farrah.  Farrah Fawcett, maybe.  Remember that poster?  I don't know the rest of them.  That was insightful.  Remember that poster?  With the boob? 
[02:43:00]  Farrah Fawcett.  How famous that was.  Everyone had it.  Yes, the nipple one.  Is Bo Derek dead?  No.  Yeah, go with Bo Derek.  I'd stick it in her.  She's in her 50s, though.  Yeah, you know what I do?  So far, I got five, but I'm not happy with my list.  I got Lauren Houghton, Diane Sawyer, Raquel Welch, Goldie Hawn, Farrah Fawcett.  Okay.  Bo Derek's 50.  Stockard Channing.  How old is Stockard Channing?  Put that in.  She was 60 during Grease.  I'm playing a high school student.  She's one of the pink ladies. 
[02:43:30]  You know what I want to do with Bo Derek?  I want to have her put her hands between her legs like fists, and I want to fuck her  hands with Grease, and while I'm coming, just make fun of Dudley Moore's club foot and  brain cancer.  Come on, tell me.  Did it make a squishy sound when he ran?  Old pudding head.  Stockard Channing's 63.  63.  Anyone?  Stockard.  Anyone?  Opie?  I'm going to...  No.  I'm going to...  Pass on Stockard.  No, I like Diane Sawyer. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, she's...  Diane Sawyer.  I kind of like her.  Lauren Hutton, Diane Sawyer, Raquel Welch, Goldie Hawn, Farrah Fawcett.  It's not going to get much better than that, I don't think.  I got Ann Margaret here.  What can I do with her?  Ann Margaret.  It's like I'm trading players for fantasy football.  I got Sophia Loren, 73.  Trading corpses.  Yeah.  I'll trade you two wrinkled tits for a pussy that hasn't been wet since the mid-80s.  I'll trade you fucking denture breath for fucking cataracts.  Shit.  All right. 
[02:44:30]  What to do?  What to do?  All right.  Suzanne Somers and Olivia Newton-John.  Oh, okay.  You get a discount with one of them.  Oh, no.  Suzanne Somers.  61.  Suzanne Somers?  Yep.  All right.  I would definitely do her.  Suzanne?  As long as she did the Chrissy Snow laugh while I was deep-dicking her.  All right.  Who do I get rid of?  I might have to say goodbye to...  I think Goldie Hawn is kind of like, ugh, with those lips and shit.  Yeah, because now she got the duck lip collagen injection. 
[02:45:00]  I'm going to have to cross out Goldie Hawn.  She's done.  You don't have Raquel Welch on there, do you?  I sure do, Jimmy.  She's 67, dude.  All right.  Well, who was the other one?  Olivia Newton-John is 59.  Fuck, this is hard.  I'm not quite there yet.  I think I'm more into the late 50s.  Is that what it is?  Shit.  You got to cross that 60 barrier.  How old's Mary Tyler Moore?  Oh, she's probably in her mid-70s.  73?  Ugh.  Fucking a sack of antlers. 
[02:45:30]  Skinny bitch.  Here's the rest of the DJ story.  Three bird, I bet you.  Three bird, yeah.  To break the record set by an Italian announcer, Albro prepared for his record broadcast with  a special diet by cutting out caffeine.  Good thinking.  Yeah.  But it's not official until Guinness World Records certifies it.  Who the fuck cares?  Well, those records are dumb because they allow you to take five-minute breaks every hour,  and then what these DJs do, they add up their five minutes, and then they take solid hour, 
[02:46:00]  two-hour naps.  Yeah.  Are they really allowed to do that?  That's not a real just...  That's not a real...  It should be...  You got to stay up.  You stay up the whole time.  Right.  But they have all these rules when setting records because they don't want anyone to  hurt themselves trying to attempt these things.  You go actually clinically insane after being awake for 24 hours, so...  Nice.  See, now that would make some entertaining radio.  Yeah.  By the way...  It's like being buzzed.  It's like the same...  24 hours.  I've done that many times, though.  Guys playing classical music, just spewing out the C word. 
[02:46:30]  It'd be fantastic.  Terry Garr.  Maybe it's the drum thing.  Terry Garr.  She used to be cute.  Debbie Harry.  Blondie.  Debbie Harry.  We saw her on TV.  Yikes.  Again, used to be...  Hey, by the way, it's going by too fast, but someone found a website.  Like, actors that were way too old to play teenagers.  I guess Stockard Channing was 34 when she played a teenager.  That's fucking...  34.  And that's a whole website dedicated to this. 
[02:47:00]  Go back a couple pages.  Olivia and John.  Well, they were all old.  Yeah.  They really were.  I'm looking.  All right.  Barbara Eden.  Barbara Eden has got to be 80 years old.  No.  She has to be 80.  Stop it.  She's pushing 80.  Ja Ja Gabor.  Oof.  She's 90.  Barbara Eden's 73.  73.  And you know she's shaving some aid off of there.  Come on.  73.  She's 78.  If she's a day.  I don't know what that means. 
[02:47:30]  73.  That's rough.  Lauren Hutton.  Diane Sawyer.  Raquel Welsh.  Farrah Fawcett.  Suzanne Somers.  I'll keep this list over here.  Farrah.  How about...  What was the one from Stripes?  She was real cute.  PJ Souls.  PJ Souls.  PJ Souls has got to be...  52.  Yeah.  Remember she was...  Remember some of the hot ones from the 80s?  Some of these hot girls.  She was so cute in that movie.  And then just no one...  Whatever she ever do again.  Just drops off...  Oh.  How old?  57. 
[02:48:00]  57?  How about the chick from...  She's pushing 60?  How about I taught you to smile or whatever from Planet of the Apes?  How old is that broad?  Oh, Jesus.  Hunter.  Her last name is Hunter.  Yeah.  Um...  Not Holly.  Mike?  Mike Hunter.  You asshole.  Chris in Chicago.  Please don't save videos on opianathlete.com when Stupid Steve hasn't put it up yet.  That's true.  Stupid Steve?  Well, the anchor's getting scared.  I thought the video was up there. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  But I guess not.  So...  It is.  Where is it?  Cheryl Teagues?  No, sorry.  Me and Ove saw Cheryl Teagues.  She looks good.  Are you kidding me?  Walking down the road.  Flat ass.  Extremely flat ass.  She completely just, like, got old lady body.  You'd have to, like, fuck her while she's on her...  Like, doing a headstand to make it look like she has an ass.  Fucking Quincy.  Oh, here we go.  Wouldn't rub a finger down her side.  Her ass is so flat.  And you know the chicks he's been with. 
[02:49:00]  Wow, unfortunately, we got the number one.  Stocker Channing was the oldest actor to play a teenager.  She was 34 when she was in Greece, which we told you already, obviously.  Yes.  I'm going to start down here a little bit.  Some of these that matter.  Like, Skeet Ulrich from Scream.  26 years old when he was supposed to be playing a teenager.  Kevin Bacon in Footloose.  He was supposed to be a teenager.  He was 26 years old.  Tobey Maguire when he was in Spider-Man. 
[02:49:30]  27 years old.  Everyone remembers that hot scene from Wild Things.  Yeah.  Denise Richards.  She was supposed to be a teenager in high school during that movie.  She was 27 years old.  Let's see who else we got.  We'll go to the next page here.  I didn't know Tony Danza was that old.  John Hedder from Napoleon Dynamite.  Of course, he's playing, what, a senior in high school?  Yeah.  He was 27 when he played that part. 
[02:50:00]  Olivia Newton-John in Greece.  Everyone in Greece.  She was 30 years old.  Playing high school.  Jeff Conaway in Greece.  27.  What a great website.  What is this called?  28.  What's the website?  Usedwigs.com.  Usedwigs.com.  I don't know.  Do you know Tony Danza was in a movie called The Hollywood Knights, which was a very funny  comedy with Robert Wool, whose HBO special I'd love to discuss shortly.  And he was 29 in 1980 when he did that.  He played a teenager.  Really?  29. 
[02:50:30]  Dorothy Hamill.  Let's look her up.  Okay.  Dorothy Hamill, the Hamill Camel.  She looked pretty good.  With her Olympic skater, Dorothy Hamill.  And there you go.  So that's it.  56.  She's born 56, so 51.  Fuck!  I said I meant the year.  I can never guess their ages.  PJ Soros was 29 when she played a teenager in Rock and Roll High School. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that...  I think I saw that.  She was 29?  Yeah.  When she played it...  Fuck.  So she was probably 31 in stripes.  Who was in stripes?  81?  Yeah.  I think she was probably 31 then.  Huh.  Wow.  There's a lot of fucking...  Wait.  Can you go to this website?  Sometimes we get fucked when people just...  Lorraine Bracco.  Lorraine Bracco?  No.  I don't think she's in her 60s.  I don't think my list is going to get much better than this.  Maybe you can make your own list.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  It's respectable.  Some respectable.  Lauren Hutton's my number one, though.  Over 60.  Yeah.  Over 60.  Valerie Bertinelli.  She's not 60.  Whoa.  Priscilla Presley.  62.  Priscilla Presley.  Hmm.  She looked good in those naked gun movies, but I don't know if she...  I think she had too much surgery.  Do I get rid of the Diane Sawyer thing?  Yes.  For Priscilla Presley, you throw that shitty reporter out.  No, I'm going to stick with Diane Sawyer.  Take that Elvis pussy.  Raquel Wells, though, is pushing 70. 
[02:52:00]  I might have to take her off my list.  Why would Raquel Wells be on the list?  She should be gone.  Put Isabel Sanford on the list.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  I liked her.  Jean Stapleton.  You see that website?  Is there anything to it?  How old is Sally Field?  It's just an accurate URL, I think.  63, I think.  You would put her at 63?  I know she is.  Dude, there's a...  Really?  I don't know what the...  Hold on.  There's a website.  You might have to dig through it to get some good ones, but someone turned us on to it  today.  It's called Fat...  What is it called?  Fat Chicks and Party Hats dot com. 
[02:52:30]  Well, yeah, it's an old site.  And it's just...  What's on it?  It's just Fat Chicks with, like, Happy Birthday and big New Year's Eve freaking party hats  on.  The Statue of Liberty on a fat broad.  All right.  You can watch.  You can check that out.  Yeah, years ago, somebody sent me a link to that.  It was pretty funny.  Oh, Pam Greer.  Oh.  Pam Greer.  Oh.  Penny Marshall?  I wouldn't have fucked her when she was 22. 
[02:53:00]  When the big ragu was sticking her.  Oh, he...  But he wasn't, though.  He was...  Who was he fucking...  He would always say, get out of the way, Dyke, and then he'd fucking face first, and  there's Shirley Feeney's anus.  Okay, Shirley Feeney.  Oh, fucking Cindy Williams?  No.  How old is Cindy Williams?  Uh, no way.  Don't even look her up.  No?  No, Dyke can't.  You wouldn't want a piece of that?  Pam Greer's in her 50s.  Fuck.  That 50s thing.  How about, uh...  I got one more.  Thank you, Brian in Connecticut.  Uh, Kelly LeBrock.  Yes.  Weird Science.  Well, you saw her on that fat show. 
[02:53:30]  Uh, Celebrity Fit Club.  She was pretty good after she lost the weight.  And you should have seen Steven Seagal.  Boy, he's turned into a fucking porker.  Kelly LeBrock.  His direct-to-video things are hysterical.  She's 47.  Is he still doing...  She's 47.  47.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Kind of an insult to some of these women, huh?  Is he still doing the same type of movies where he's the hero, karate guy?  Yeah, yeah, karate guy.  And he's big and fat.  Why?  It just doesn't work.  And they're direct-to-video.  All of them.  I'm sorry, man.  Guys like Sean Connery age gracefully. 
[02:54:00]  Like, that's a guy who kind of...  He just went up and became an older man.  Yeah.  Um, Burt Reynolds fights it and fought it.  Oof.  And why is, uh, Steven Seagal trying to be an action hero?  I don't know.  He hasn't put out a real movie in a decade, though.  He has a lot of these weird B and C movies that, like, are seen in one country.  What?  Just the titles of his last 10 movies.  Oh, just ridiculous, right?  Um, in production is Prince of Pistols.  Completed is Pistol Whipped.  Urban Justice, Flight of Fury, Attack Force, Shadow Man. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, they're all just...  Just, yeah.  Keep going.  It's pretty good.  Mercenary for Justice, Black Dawn.  Today You Die.  Oh, God!  No, that was actually Today You Die-It.  That was a memo to him.  All right, well, raise your hand when you've heard any of these movies.  He's already done 10, so then you keep going.  Keep my hands down.  Uh, Black Dawn, Today You Die.  Yeah, Submerged, Into the Surrey, Out of Reach, Clementine, Anybody? 
[02:55:00]  No?  Belly of the Beast, Out for a Kill, The Foreigner.  Anyone recognize these movies?  No!  Half Past Dead.  That was theatrical.  Uh, Ticker.  Would you fuck Mrs. Brady?  That's the last one.  Hell no, not if she was banging Mr. Brady.  We have to go 21 movies down, and that would be Exit Wounds from 2001.  He does a lot of movies.  Half Past Dead?  Is it theirs?  Yeah, it was in theaters.  Oh, okay.  I don't remember even Exit Wounds I've heard of.  Florence Henderson? 
[02:55:30]  Oh, would you?  No, no, no.  No?  No, of course not.  Of course not.  She's got things that are growing out of control on her face.  I study this stuff.  Does she really?  Yeah.  Like moles that weren't taken care of.  Yeah, she means well.  They're full of Wesson oil.  Yeah.  You know how we say, leave the Aztecs for the young?  Leave the moles for the young, too.  Yeah.  Moles on younger people, not bad.  After a while, you've got to get them.  After a while, you've got to get them snipped or something.  Really?  You've got to get them shaved down.  They take on a life of their own.  Like if you roll through Vaseline and there's mole marks on the Vaseline, get it fixed. 
[02:56:00]  That's a good test.  Roll through Vaseline.  The rule of thumb.  Yes.  Take a big fucking tub of Vaseline, and if you fall face first into it, you can still see mole prints.  You're a moly asshole.  That's a fucking...  A moly.  Yes.  You're a moly asshole, and you need work.  With that, we're going to take a break, because we've got Phil Donahue or Bill Donahue?  Bill.  Bill.  Who actually does a more entertaining show than Phil.  Yes.  Bill Donahue's checking in, because, I don't know, he's pissed off at Britney Spears.  Yeah, we'll find out what that's all about.  Of course she is.  Ah, and Maury has overweight babies. 
[02:56:30]  Yep.  Nice.  Help our five babies weigh over 450 pounds.  And they dress him in little whore wear for the Maury show, so their guts are hanging out.  And then they put a big table full of food in front of them and make them eat.  And the mother is a fat slob.  Maury is, uh...  Look at the head on that mother.  He's sick.  Two and a half.  She's 70 pounds.  Wow.  I like that.  Look at the size of that kid. 
[02:57:00]  Big fatso.  I think it's hilarious.  You do want to go on her belly and go...  Just watch it go...  Back and forth.  What is she hungry?  Here she is eating.  Whoa.  I'm also getting a communique that we were mentioned on Fox Report with Shepard Smith last night  during the Britney Spears pit.  What did Shep say?  I'm allergic to something here.  Bless you. 
[02:57:30]  I sent the audio clip to Danny last night.  It's regarding the Britney picture seducing a Catholic priest.  That's what we're going to talk about next with Bill Donahue.  Oh, because Danny probably said Bill Donahue was at the forefront.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  We'll figure it out next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Oh, Cunningham.  I'm gay.  I just barked mouth.  He said sit on it.  So I did.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  All right. 
[02:58:00]  Let's go.  Uh, we're distracted by Maury Povich.  Maury.  Got, uh, Chubsters on there with their moms.  One of his favorite subjects.  He parades out a disgustingly obese baby and, uh, the moms.  And, uh, it's a freak show.  And that makes them eat.  Makes them wear, uh, shit that they never wear around the house. 
[02:58:30]  You know, that girl.  There's a girl.  She's wearing a little tiny halter top.  She's an infant and, uh, a skirt and her belly is hanging out.  And out of nowhere, Jimmy's just sitting there.  He just goes, Bob Kelly.  All right.  Hey, we got, we'll get back to that.  But we got Bill Donahue on the line here.  Holy flap over.  Here we go.  A beautiful Britney Spears pic.  Uh, just a bottom of the barrel stunt. 
[02:59:00]  Uh, kinky photos of a half-naked Britney Spears perched on a priest's lap, uh, and leaning  seductively against a church confessional sparked outrage among Catholic leaders.  I guess these pictures were included in her, uh, album Blackout.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's a, they're calling it a bottom of the barrel stunt from a girl who really  could use some quality time spent, uh, repenting sins in a wooden cubicle.  I keep saying ah today because my mic just doesn't want to stay in the broadcast position. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, well.  Hey, let's say hi to our old nemesis, Bill Donahue.  Our new friend.  How you guys doing?  How you doing, Bill?  What's up, Bill?  Bill, you love this stuff, don't you?  You know, it's amazing.  You know, I get over to Fox and I'm doing something on the Golden Compass and then they  get me on veterans and under God and then they get me on Britney Spears.  I said, this is why I got my doctorate in sociology at NYU, so I could talk about Britney  Spears.  Yeah, see, now you're dragged into the whole Britney thing. 
[03:00:00]  Well, you know, listen, quite frankly, you know, when Madonna was doing a little mock  crucifixion thing, that angered me, but this doesn't bother me that much.  I mean, quite frankly, I do feel sorry for her.  I mean, the girl's crashing, you know, she can't bring up her kids, she can't act, she  can't entertain anymore.  Or I look, she's trying to gin up her career by pulling a little stunt like this.  It's, you know, it's not the worst thing that I've seen.  It's just, you know, she's just tweaking.  And, you know, I really, I sincerely mean that she does need to get some counseling, whether  it's a secular counselor or a priest or a rabbi or somebody, because this girl's on 
[03:00:30]  the verge of just going over the deep end.  You think she's trying one of those kind of Madonna publicity things, knowing that she  needs to put this album over or else her career is completely dead?  That's the only way I can read it.  I'm trying to be open-minded about it.  How else could you interpret it?  She's her own fans.  I mean, I've never really hated the girl.  I mean, I just, just not exactly a fan of hers, but her own fans are the ones who are  walking away from her.  So it's a way of getting a little publicity stunt or probably a publicist put it up to 
[03:01:00]  it.  You know, look, she's a cute girl.  She's done some very good entertaining in the past, but between her and Lindsay Lohan  and Paris Hilton, the three musketeers, I don't know which one of these stooges is the  worst.  Bill, is there ever a time, like, for some reason, like, sexualizing religious figures,  typically with priests and nuns?  I think because of the taboo of it, and there are people that we don't see as sexual beings  at all.  We just see them as kind of, as the title.  I think that's true, and I think that to prove that, all you have to do is go into Halloween 
[03:01:30]  costumes and type in Catholic or something like that.  There's no end to the Catholic, you know, the priest and the nuns and the hot nun wearing  the black lace stockings.  Just saw the pregnant nun walking down the street from a Halloween party the other day.  That's kind of a hack costume.  And, you know, that's getting a little bit too crazy.  See, there's actually guys with a priest with an erection, too, and, you know, now you're  getting kind of gross on this stuff. 
[03:02:00]  If you type in rabbi and imam, you get practically nothing.  Saint to administer it.  And I understand the Catholic religion is very rich with its rituals and its traditions and  costumes, and it's fodder for this kind of stuff.  So, look, this is not the end of the world.  I'm more worried about people like this bum from England, Philip Pullman, trying to sell  his lousy attack on Catholicism and the like in this golden compass.  And Miller Brewing, which I think we're on the verge of breaking for sponsoring an anti-Catholic 
[03:02:30]  street fair in San Francisco.  These are the kind of things that bother me more than Britney.  Wait, they sponsor that?  Oh, yeah.  Miller sponsored the Folsom Street Fair out in San Francisco where men masturbated in the  streets and had oral sex committed on each other.  I'm not going to get involved in trying to police America on this crap.  I am going to get involved when the anti-Catholicism kicks in, when they give money to the sisters  of perpetual indulgence.  These guys are dressed as nuns and drag, and then you're selling religious symbols like 
[03:03:00]  a crucifix as a sex toy and dildos.  Well, they kind of have a thing against the Catholic Church because of the whole, you know,  hey, if you're gay, you're...  I mean, let's have a rational discussion.  I mean, Catholic Church has nothing against gay people.  It's against homosexuality, you know, Catholic Church...  A little bit of semantics going on there.  Wait a minute.  If the Catholic Church is against adultery, is it against straights?  Let's see.  Adultery, straights... 
[03:03:30]  No, but it is comfortable...  No, but it is comfortable with straight sex between married people.  There's no instance that it seems like gay people are allowed to have sex in Catholicism.  Technically, if you're straight, you're not supposed to have sex either until you're married, so...  Look, the bar's pretty high for Catholics, okay?  But you're right.  I mean, it's one...  Listen, everybody has a right to argue with any of the public positions, and this is the  public position, the Catholic Church is in our marriage, and go ahead and debate it, 
[03:04:00]  but why do people have to stoop to bigotry in order to make their point?  I mean, I'm not going to defend gay bashing simply because I disagree with certain things  that the gay lifestyle seems to punctuate.  Well, can I play devil's advocate?  Not that it's bigotry, just to be honest.  I think the reason you see attacks like that is because basically, I mean, when you look  at gays or the church, the church is a much more powerful entity, and I think a lot of  gay people do want to be a part of the church, and let me ask, do you think in any way the  Catholic Church is kind of... 
[03:04:30]  Not that it should change its belief system as society changes.  You can't do that.  But are there things like stem cells and other things that they are just out of step with  people and incorrectly so on?  The Catholic Church is totally in favor of stem cell research as long as it's adult stem  cell research.  You can take it from the pancreas, take it from your arm, your leg, whatever you want  to do on something like that.  The problem is with embryonic stem cell research.  Why?  Because you can't do embryonic stem cell research without first killing the embryo.  Now, again, people can have an honest discussion as to when life begins. 
[03:05:00]  If you believe that life begins at conception, which to me is biology 101, then you can't  be in favor of embryonic stem cell research.  Why don't we exhaust all of the possibilities with adult stem cell research with nobody in  the Catholic Church as opposed to that?  Why are they not doing it?  What is the difference?  I don't know enough about it.  Are the embryos more rich with what they're looking for?  I mean, there has to be a reason, because if it was that simple, they obviously would be  doing that to avoid the conflict.  Well, you know, that's a good question, and I'm not going to step into an area where I 
[03:05:30]  don't have expertise there.  I do read what some of the scientists in that area have had to say about it, and there's  no conclusive evidence that suggests that, boy, if we get our hands on embryonic stem  cell research, we're really going to make breakthroughs.  As a matter of fact, just the opposite.  Here, the New York Times had a splendid piece about two months ago showing all the prospects  that are out there for other forms of stem cell research.  So, yeah, and again, you know, people can have these differences.  And the Catholic Church has all this power.  Maybe at one time it did. 
[03:06:00]  It doesn't have anything against gays per se.  I mean, have you guys noticed there's more than a few gay priests?  Well, that's the odd part, is that it seems like Catholicism really needs to kind of open  its eyes and kind of look at the people that have been serving it for a long time.  I mean, there are a lot of gay priests who are not pedophiles, they're just gay guys,  but they're good priests, and they do good service for Catholics.  And it just seems like it's about time that the Church did recognize that these people  have been doing service.  Well, I think that's...  I'm going to go along with that. 
[03:06:30]  I know gay priests who are good men and do service to the Church, and they were down there  at 9-11, and they didn't need anybody, any archbishop to try to tell them what they  had to do and the like.  And so, if I'm going to be careful about criticizing people for making sweeping generalizations  about all Catholic priests, because some are that way, I have to be sensitive and not  make sweeping generalizations about gay priests.  You have to look at this individually.  Now, I think when you take a look at the abuse situation in the Catholic Church, it's 
[03:07:00]  obviously clear that being gay doesn't make you be a molester, but it's no question about  it that 81% of the cases in the Catholic Church deal with molestation.  And you're dealing with a gay situation here.  What do you think it is about...  It seems like...  Because all religions, I'm sure, even in Muslims have it, it's just been quieter.  What is it about...  Why is it in Catholicism more prevalent, you think, than with rabbis?  Is it the marriage situation?  Is there any kind of connection there, you think?  I think that if you go back to the 60s and 70s, the answer would be yes, in the sense 
[03:07:30]  that a lot of gay guys who wanted to please their parents and show that they really did  something worthwhile, they chose the priesthood, maybe not for the best reasons.  However, let's keep one thing in mind.  You take a look at the Episcopal clergy, and particularly in places like New York and  San Francisco, most of these guys are gay, and yet they can get married.  So it's a little bit too easy to simply say that celibacy is the thing.  Remember now, celibacy is not a sacred teaching of the Catholic Church. 
[03:08:00]  They could change that teaching this afternoon.  That's what's called a discipline.  It's like, you know, no meat on Friday.  Jesus never taught any of this.  This is just the Catholic Church's understanding.  So there's a big difference between the dogma, the belief that, you know, Father, Son, and  Holy Ghost, that's dogma.  And then these man-made rules in the Church, and, you know, they changed them.  I mean, the Catholic Church couldn't be around for over 2,000 years unless it was able to  adapt to some extent.  Hey, if I eat meat on Friday, will I go to hell? 
[03:08:30]  No question about it, you will not.  And I love a good hot dog as long as it's kosher.  I have a question, too.  I thought of you in something.  Mother Teresa's book, I haven't read it.  I've only read excerpts.  What did you think of it?  Have you read it?  I thought it was very sad.  What I read about it was very sad.  What I've done is I've mined it.  In other words, in this job here, I have a hard time getting through everything.  But I've mined it only to find out that Time magazine distorted it. 
[03:09:00]  And my good debating friend, Christopher Hitchens, as usual, is wrong when it comes to the subject  of religion.  Look, I'm glad you mentioned it.  Mother Teresa said that sometimes she couldn't feel the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.  Feeling and believing are two different properties.  She never even came close to implying that she didn't believe in Jesus.  But she said that sometimes they didn't feel His presence.  Well, yeah, that happens with everybody. 
[03:09:30]  And you go through some periods of doubt and the like.  But she didn't go through periods of doubt in the sense that she decided, well, she's  going to become an atheist next week.  And I think that's the spin that some people put on it, I think, was deplorable.  No, no, I don't mean that.  I don't think that she was denying it or trashing Catholicism.  But I thought that it was more severe than that.  Didn't they say that she lost it when she began what they called the work?  Like that she really lost a lot of her faith?  And maybe it's a feeling.  I mean, we could say belief.  Like, you know, if a gun was in her head, she would have said, yes, He exists.  But I mean, the feeling is kind of what makes the faith real anyway, right? 
[03:10:00]  Well, no, I think it's really more the believing.  And I think that's where I would disagree with you on that.  Now, she did say that she felt the touch of God more closely before she began her work.  That much is accurate.  But again, feeling and believing are two different properties.  If faith is based on feeling, well, then you get into that whole charismatic thing and carried away.  And sometimes, you know, if you don't get that bandwagon effect, then somehow you lose your faith.  Her faith was sturdier than that.  I mean, this is a woman who, when she embraced the lepers, somebody said to her, 
[03:10:30]  how in the world could you embrace lepers?  I wouldn't do that for all the money in the world.  And she said, I wouldn't either.  All right?  I mean, this is a woman who, somebody said to her, one time a journalist said,  are you married?  She says, yes, I am.  And my spouse is extremely demanding.  She's talking about Jesus.  Now, she had her own way of talking about things.  But I think that sometimes the people in the popular media had a field day with this.  And Christopher, who's obviously an atheist, he's going to jump on this. 
[03:11:00]  But I think, take a closer read at it.  She comes off very, very well.  I guess faith is, you know, mostly based on the fact that if you don't have the feeling,  yet you still believe, that is more important than if you did have the feeling all the time,  then it would make your faith a lot easier.  Because then you have this constant feeling, or you're looking for this clue or some kind of sign  that would make faith easier than if all of a sudden maybe you start doubting that you're feeling something, 
[03:11:30]  yet you still have the faith in you.  It makes it more, I think it makes the faith more important.  Well, you're going to probably think that I'm being facetious here.  I'm not.  But what you just said is excellent.  I can't improve on it.  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  That's exactly what the Catholic Church teaches, and that's the best way to understand this.  This is Opie and Anthony, people. 
[03:12:00]  So theology, 101.  Go figure that out.  Did Mother Teresa see one set or two sets of footprints in the sand, then?  Well, yeah, that's a good question, yeah.  I don't know.  She seemed easy to carry.  She set up over 500 hospitals, hospices, and she set up the first AIDS patient clinic here in Greenwich Village.  She was a magnificent woman.  Hey, another thing.  You know, John, the ex-pope there in the fire, his image in the fire. 
[03:12:30]  What do you think of that crap when that pops up in the media?  Like all of a sudden there's an image of God or Jesus in like a piece of toast, and then they've got to like save the piece of toast.  Yeah, well, I think it's a mania.  I think there are people in the Catholic Church and outside the Catholic Church who've got these fixations and the like, and I think it's people getting hung up on this.  You know, we live in a world of celebrities and all this spoof and the Britney Spears and the like, and it's a cheap way to understand something that's really much more intricate than that. 
[03:13:00]  And if, you know, people want to get their jollies out of that kind of stuff, I mean, I can't take it to you.  Yeah, but they come from all over the place just to kind of pray in front of this crap.  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's, you know, and the Catholic Church has been very, very careful about recognizing and validating any of these kinds of things.  I mean, they don't want to be insulting to the people, but at the same time, if you take a look at what the Catholic Church has been prepared to validate, it's a very, very small number of these kinds of things. 
[03:13:30]  Hey, Bill, I don't know if you'd be proud of us or not, but when we were up in Boston, one of these images appeared on a window in a house, and they had thousands of people show up, and they were online for hours just to, you know, take a look at this image on this glass.  One of our guys got in there, and we came this close to breaking the window live on our show.  Would have disappointed a lot of people.  We tried our hardest.  He had a brick.  He had everything.  He was all set.  I think at the last second, he either chickened out or someone was on to him and kicked him out of the place. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, you think Jesus Christ had a sense of humor?  Of course.  Does he show that anywhere in the scriptures?  Well, you know, I'm thinking about that scene.  Now, admittedly, is this right out of the scripture or not?  I don't know.  I'm thinking about that scene where he had that playful little scene with Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion of the Christ.  He's playing with his mother and splashing water in her face and the like.  Listen, you're talking about the son of God who, you know, the idea that he wouldn't have had a sense of humor, to me, is simply unbelievable. 
[03:14:30]  Well, I ask that because it's like this Britney thing.  Like, would he find something like this funny or why would it have – why does it always have to be like sacrilege?  Why can't it be, oh, this is just showing a little humor?  Yeah.  See, let me tell you something.  The newspapers will always say when they call him, they ask me for a little spot on something, you know, I'll give them a little sound bite.  Next thing you know, it's like Donnie was fuming.  Donnie was in a rush.  Yeah, yeah.  Donnie was walking out the door, you know what I mean, to get a beer. 
[03:15:00]  And then somebody calls him and says, what do you have to say about this, you know?  Yeah.  On a scale of one to ten, guys, this is closer down to one, you know what I mean?  Yeah, they want to make a lot more of it than it really is or that you even are making of it, and that's what it is.  You're fuming.  But why does this stuff have to always be taken so seriously?  Why can't it just be like, oh, this is just silly.  There's a little sense of humor here, a little like, you know, God can handle this type of thing.  Playing off the stereotype.  The other day, we said last week in the newspapers, they were talking about some high school girls involved in a porn movie, okay? 
[03:15:30]  What do they say?  Catholic high school girls, the big headlines.  Now, you never see a yeshiva girl, right?  Remember a yeshiva girl?  Or no, a PS109 girl involved.  Well, they're not seen as sexy.  They're not seen as sexy.  It's more taboo.  Right, right, right.  They become associated with sexiness because of the skirts and the outfits.  That's all that is.  Yeah, I know.  And it's always us who gets the attention.  Yeah, that uniform's got to be changed there, Bill. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, make them wear pantsuits like Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton looking.  Yeah, everyone will leave them alone.  Haven't they figured it out by now that they look hot in those stupid Catholics?  I mean, come on, change the outfit.  Get jogging suits at this point.  The old children are going to have to look at her legs.  I mean, because Ann was talking about Halloween, you know how many Catholic schoolgirl skirts they're going to be at these parties?  Oh, God, yeah.  Just change the outfit.  Bill, quickly here.  What do you think about the president?  Who are you looking at? 
[03:16:30]  Well, I've been asked to meet with some of the candidates, and I've said no.  And that's because I don't want to get too close.  Both these Republicans and Democrats will just use you and spit you out once they think they have you in your pocket.  I think it's a mess.  I haven't seen anything quite like it in my lifetime, but right across the board, I know that in terms of the social conservatives, and certainly I would be one of them, they can't figure.  There's a major, major fight going on.  Nobody can talk about any one candidate. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, it is really kind of weird this time around because a lot of people just, they pick their candidate based on a few things, but there are very strong issues that they have, and that's what they're pulling the lever for.  But then you get somebody like Giuliani, who, he's a Republican, obviously.  I'd put him at more conservative than liberal for sure, yet he is pro-choice, which kind of upsets a lot of Catholics. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, look, he's got a lot of baggage too besides that, but he did a great job in New York City.  There's no question about it.  But isn't that kind of what's important, doing the job?  It's extremely important, but I'll tell you one thing.  If Jeb Bush had another name, call him Jones, he'd be the nominee.  But we're not going to put up with another Bush in the White House.  No, I don't think so.  We're going to put up with another Clinton.  I don't know. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  I have a question too, a little off the subject, and this has probably been asked before.  It's just an odd thing which people have raised, and it sounds silly, but Christ, when you see images of Christ, he's long hair, a beard.  I mean, he's pretty much a rebel, a hippie.  You know what I mean?  A liberal.  A liberal.  Very.  Honestly, in that time, a very anti-society type of guy.  Why is the image, like that image now, seen as like inappropriate?  Do you understand what I mean?  I don't know that it is inappropriate, but I'll tell you what, I think that the real rebels or dissidents or the counterculture today are conservatives. 
[03:18:30]  It's certainly not the establishment people.  When you have the likes of Time Warner, which owns CNN and New Line Cinema, and Scholastic putting out a movie which sells atheism and thrashes Christianity, or at least the books do, not so much the movie.  You're talking about the Golden Compass.  Yeah.  Miller Brewing Company, defending these out-and-out attacks on the Catholic Church.  That John Edwards had hired two anti-Catholics to write for him before I got them tossed. 
[03:19:00]  I mean, you're talking about the establishment here weighing in.  I just did.  I got off of Fox TV talking about how the Veterans Administration, now you can't use the word God in any of the recitations and the like.  I mean, you know, I think the real counterculture today's hippies are the people who are saying, listen, what's wrong with the modicum of restraint?  What's wrong with protecting the rights of the unborn?  What's wrong with keeping marriage between, you know, Mary and Mike and not Tom, Dick, and Harry? 
[03:19:30]  But, Bill, are they really, like when you say the thing in San Francisco or wherever it was, that street fair, I mean, let's be honest, they are a lot of times a bunch of asses.  Very flamboyant, yeah.  But is that really?  Minority of the...  Is that sponsoring an attack on Christianity, or is that just allowing people to do something that is, yeah, maybe gross or unpopular, but still under the umbrella of free speech?  Like, is that really sponsoring something that's anti-Christian, or just basically allowing them to do what they want to do?  Well, if you give money to a group, which is known to thrash another group, then I think at that point you're sponsoring it. 
[03:20:00]  Now, are they responsible for everything that goes on at the fair?  Of course not.  But, you know, we have the St. Patrick's Day Parade every year, and a couple of these mix get loaded.  Bill's one of them.  It's going to be me, of course.  Yeah.  No.  Bill, you're not fun, by the way.  Yeah.  You found humor in The Passion of the Christ.  You're not a fun guy.  I like that.  Huh?  You guys got to march with us some year.  We have a good time.  Yeah.  What was the last comedy you saw that you really laughed at? 
[03:20:30]  The last comedy that I saw?  I don't know.  Some of these Lifetime movies, I know they're not supposed to be comedic, but I think they're hysterical.  You are.  Man, you hit that one on the head.  Oh, my God.  Hey, who wins in the end, God or Muhammad?  Muhammad, I wouldn't put my money on that guy.  No way.  I mean, listen, we got to reach out across the aisle to people, but don't push it too far.  I mean, you know, as soon as somebody lays down his machete and wants to shake hands with me, I'll do it. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, it really is getting ugly.  I'm not worried about Jose.  Jose wants a job.  I'm worried about Abdul.  Our God is an awesome God, as I have heard.  Remember that song?  Yes, I do.  That is true.  All right, Bill.  Thank you very much, Bill.  Thanks so much for coming on.  We like your take on these things whenever they pop up in the news, and definitely appreciate you coming on, man.  Yeah, I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  That's some things.  Keep it the good work.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Thanks, Bill.  Bye-bye now.  Bill Donahue, I don't know how he became kind of a friend or an ally or whatever. 
[03:21:30]  Because he's just an honest guy, it seems.  But, you know, there are people, obviously, that see hypocrisy in him and don't like him.  I know Kevin Smith really doesn't like him because of the crap he put him through with the movie Dogma.  Sure.  Stuff, but, I mean, and he was at the forefront of getting us fired.  But, you know, you've got to appreciate the guy, he sees a cause or whatever, he wants to defend his religion, and he does it with fervor, doesn't he? 
[03:22:00]  When I started to like him, as we had him on that day, we were going to just, ah, let's just, you know, smash him.  And we were talking about it.  He goes, look, I didn't hear the broadcast.  They came to me, and they said this couple had sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  What do you want me to say?  I'm the head of the Catholic League.  It was like, that was his attitude.  It's okay.  Yeah, I guess so.  You do have to comment.  Yeah.  It was the media more than it was them, so.  Well, I hope he doesn't have XM, because we go to break with this.  Oh, no.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor. 
[03:22:30]  Temptations of a Catholic priest aren't easy to ignore.  But I cannot control myself, it rips my soul apart. 
[03:23:00]  For one small sheep among my flock has stole the shepherd's heart.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[03:23:30]  At Sunday Mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread eagle on the pew.  Yeah.  When I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry.  Altar boy, altar boy, altar boy, is it gonna be heaven or hell? 
[03:24:00]  You can play my organ all night long, if you promise never to tell.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Altar boy, altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, no.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, altar boy, oh, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  Oh, no.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That never gets old.  Oh, man, that never gets old. 
[03:26:00]  Stephen Lynch on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, everybody, it's Stephen Lynch, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on W...  Oh, no, on XM Satellite Radio.  The virus is spreading.  That's got to be fake.  Getting ready for the line of the day and other things.  We have a new guest of sound, I believe. 
[03:26:30]  I'm looking at the video right now.  That's got to be fake.  Is that what Danny...  Where are you, Jimmy?  Jimmy, what happened?  Jimmy!  Oh, my God.  You grabbed the wrong mic.  I do that all the time.  Dude, that's got to be fake.  It doesn't look real.  I don't...  Ball busting.  I don't know, it's bleeding.  Yeah, he's bleeding.  Dude, he's...  Oh, man.  Well, yeah, if you're going to make a fake video, you would do things to make it look real. 
[03:27:00]  I don't know.  I'm going to go with fake.  Steve?  Real.  All right, it's real then.  All right, get Pat Duffy to do exactly that with a pen.  Here's the sound.  Guess the sound.  Guess the sound.  It's real. 
[03:27:30]  That's not real.  Dude, it's real.  The color, the way it swelled up on top of one when he hit it a few times.  The way the bounce of the hammer?  Yeah, the bounce of the hammer.  The, uh...  I guess I'm not playing guess the sound anymore.  No, it's...  The way he does...  He's a little tentative in the real whack. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, speaking of this guess the sound, is Pat Duffy here today?  No, not tomorrow.  So is tomorrow the day he tries to get a piece of his penis caught in a zipper?  There's no way you can consciously do that.  If he plays his cards right.  Yeah.  You pull a little ball...  I told you the technique.  You pull a little ball bag out.  Ball bag or penis skin?  A cock hole, right?  Remember where your cock hole is?  No.  Oh, yeah.  It depends if you're a grower or a shower.  Yeah, you can get some of that skin out there.  I think it would be skin just under the head of your dick. 
[03:28:30]  And then you gotta, like...  Ow.  You zip the hole, so, like, half the hole is caught, and it looks like it's having  a stroke.  Right.  And then you just go...  Real fast.  Let's see if it's done.  So, you want to play guess the sound?  I guess we kind of gave it away.  But here's the sound again, and then we'll tell you what it is.  We kind of blew this one.  And usually we let it sit there for a day or two, but I couldn't help it.  Couldn't. 
[03:29:00]  And with the answer, it's our own Danny.  Well, it's a gentleman who has his sack completely out and resting on something, and he's taking  what has to be...  It has to be, like, a 10, 20-pound sledgehammer.  Yeah.  And he's just...  He's not whacking it so hard, but he's doing it enough to the point where it would hurt tremendously 
[03:29:30]  if it was you.  Yeah.  And he's just kind of bouncing it up and down on his ball.  If he went hard, they would just splatter and shoot out.  But he's just going, like, tap, tap, tap, and it starts bleeding.  The bag starts bleeding.  I'd like to just sit him down and go, sir, why are you doing that?  I'm sure he'd have a rational answer for you.  Could you please explain why you're doing that?  Right.  What did mother do to you?  Yes.  What did mother do for you?  Mother.  Mother.  Did mother scold you for tinkling with your boy jewels when you were young and punish you? 
[03:30:00]  Speaking of mother, do we have an update today?  A little bit.  Our own thing?  Oh, we actually have a mother update.  Eh, more or less.  All right.  Hopefully more.  I've gotten through the grapevine, which I guess is just my sister, that she has accepted  that she will not have me in her life anymore.  Wow.  I thought that was going to be accepted.  Accepted that I may have overreacted. 
[03:30:30]  I accept that I got some issues that I got to work out.  I accept that maybe I did have something to do with the divorce with your father.  So this is just accepting that it's okay that you're gone.  Well, she knows Dan just really hates her.  That's probably it, too.  She also knows that he's coming from where he really hates her guts.  Wow.  She's a narcissist.  Wait, how did that come down?  Um, you know, my sister's trying to get, she's trying to patch everything up.  In time for Thanksgiving.  Good job.  In time for the carving of the turkey. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, she's not exactly, I can't think you're a diplomat.  She's not a good patcher-upper.  She's not exactly Madeleine Albright.  There you go.  Or Jimmy Carter.  Henry Kissinger.  Yeah.  Idi Amin.  She's not exactly Genghis Khan.  Oh, damn.  Wow.  I'm sorry to hear that.  I was hoping.  So she has officially accepted that you're not going to, wow.  Because I won't apologize for my comments. 
[03:31:30]  Can we get her on the air?  Wow.  I could try.  I mean, if you're going to throw the relationship away, might as well do it in front of a bunch  of people.  What the hell else is, might as well capitalize on it.  Yeah.  Throw it on my reel.  I like the otter's holding.  Well, I don't think she knows any of this stuff that's been talked about on air.  Really?  A lovely one-two punch for her.  Yeah.  She's accepted that she won't have anything to do with you in her life. 
[03:32:00]  How does that make you feel, Thang?  Small.  Aw.  And I'm tall.  Aw.  Well, it just sort of reinforced, like, rather than honestly conceive of the possibility  that she might have had a false step or two.  You know something?  Thang's pouring his guts out over here.  And me and Danny are just laughing at cats using a toilet bowl on the TV. 
[03:32:30]  And flushing.  We're just looking at that.  Thang's going through this whole thing with his mom.  And me and Danny are just, like, pointing and laughing.  What got me was they had a black box over.  Or I can only assume with shit coming out of the cat.  With shit coming out of the cat.  They had to fucking put a box over it so you couldn't see it on the TV.  Sorry.  Hold on.  I'm going to put CNN on.  Focus.  So you're saying that you're very hurt.  Back to you, Thang.  You're hurt that she was ready to just throw the relationship out. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  So you are hurt.  I guess.  I mean, nobody wants to hear that from their mom.  Yeah.  So was your whole thing with her just basically a way of showing her that you're hurt?  Like, this whole anger thing you have with her is just hopefully a way to get her to apologize.  No.  I mean, to be honest, it's just like, since I don't, I really don't feel I lose that much  as an outcome of this.  But you.  I just don't, like, I don't want to create awkwardness at family functions.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:33:30]  But, like, in terms of how my life is impacted, it's negligible.  I can see that you don't feel like you're losing much on this.  That's why it's okay.  But there's probably a part of you that feels that she should feel that she's losing something  here.  Oh, absolutely.  Which is you, her son.  I would think that most parents.  Yeah, they would.  Yeah.  What's your response going to be to this?  You know, the shuttle diplomacy that's going on.  Wish granted.  Wish granted. 
[03:34:00]  Are you going to give in a little bit and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, now this is getting crazy.  Hey, let's talk.  Whoa, hey.  Is there any of that going to happen?  No, I might send her an email saying, these are the conditions if we're going to hang  out at family functions.  All right.  Do you have your conditions?  Do you have a few in your head?  Yeah.  The second you start to act in the behavior that annoys me, I'm going to leave.  Ooh.  That doesn't care if she's a kid.  Sounds a little threatening.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, what else do I, I either avoid my family, which isn't, can't be that. 
[03:34:30]  Or just don't have any conditions, just nod at her when you get there.  Hello?  Hello?  Without any conditions, there'll probably be problems.  If you want to see our mother, I want three days' notice.  It's very Michael Corleone-ish.  Mike?  Yes.  I didn't know she's going to be a hit.  Wow.  I didn't know we were going to get a mother update today, but there you go.  Wow.  I feel like there needs to be some sort of consequence for her acting out.  Now, do you really want to send her the conditions, or do you just want to have a communication  with her?  No, it's too frightening.  No, no, but that is a communication. 
[03:35:00]  What?  Sending her a list of conditions is communicating.  Yes.  So it's just a way of engaging her.  Oh, you're saying like it's a concession?  Yeah, because if she's given up hope and said the last thing she said was, hey, I accept  the fact that, you know, you're out of my life and stuff, and then you go, okay, well,  here's some conditions.  It's going to be like, well, wait a minute.  I accepted, you know, that you're done.  It would be funny if he wrote them and she wrote, who's this?  Oh, God.  She just replied, unsubscribe. 
[03:35:30]  That's awful.  I have a feeling that Than is positioning for Thanuary.  Yeah.  Thanuary.  Oh.  Please.  This could be a big setup for Thanuary.  Well, we've got to wait through.  If they can.  November.  If those segments can be as laugh a minute as this.  December.  Yeah.  All right, well.  December.  And then.  Well, that sucks.  But now we got some.  December.  Yeah.  What?  That's funny.  December.  Thanuary.  Yeah, it's going to be Povember.  Right.  And then December. 
[03:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then Thanuary.  Right.  So he doesn't get one for, you know, a few months.  Who else do we have?  And then Danbury.  Sort of.  Sort of.  Hold on.  I'm trying.  Danbury.  Feb, you drunk.  Feb, you holic.  Janus cirrhosis of the liver.  It doesn't even kind of go coming close.  I didn't know who went.  All right. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  Why don't we play something fun now?  Sucks.  That sucks, Sam.  But we got to move on.  Wow.  Saving all my love for you.  Okay.  Because I'm saving all my love for you.  Thank you.  Well, see.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He's so good, isn't he?  Well, the woman who wrote in saying that she misheard the song thought it said, because  I'm shaving off my muff for you.  I don't know if muff is a bad word.  Is it?  Look, I can't say it. 
[03:37:00]  Okay.  Sorry.  By the way, we have the creator of the Singing Beyond today.  Sorry.  Is it a bad word and I just don't know it?  Later on, we'll get the dictionary out for you.  Am I about to get fired?  What the fuck is this?  No, no, no.  Everything's great.  No, it's fantastic.  So let's move on.  Bon Jovi.  And we're going to be decorating cupcakes later on the show.  Let's move on.  Bon Jovi.  Okay, this is bad.  We're going to move on.  Wow.  She didn't know muff is a bad word?  Apparently not.  Who was that?  That was one of the hosts from, I believe it was the 10 show in Philadelphia. 
[03:37:30]  It was their local morning show.  Oh, my God.  And she had no fucking clue?  Yeah, they were talking about misheard lyrics and lyrics that people don't know.  And no one thought it was shaving off my muff.  They thought it was funny to say shaving off my muff.  And she just fucking said it.  Oh, that's great.  What a dummy.  Gotta love live TV.  And then she just kept saying it.  What is that a bad word?  Is it bad muff?  Can't you tell by the reaction of the whole crowd?  Oh, shit.  It doesn't mean cunt, does it? 
[03:38:00]  Right.  All right.  Oh, there's chocolate Jesus with his big penis blurred out.  Huh?  How does it stay cold?  I don't know.  Is it the type of chocolate that has to stay cold?  No.  That doesn't even...  It's like chocolate fucking serial killer.  And where's the hair?  Chocolate Wayne Gacy.  It doesn't look like Jesus without the more clawing hair.  My thing is, why isn't it melting?  Why isn't it melting?  Oh, these chocolate must have been lost.  It is.  I have a chocolate Jesus. 
[03:38:30]  It's going to melt.  By the way, for Danny, February could be Feb-ru-ary.  Feb-ru-ary.  Feb-ru-ary.  Like brew.  Feb-ru-ary.  Drinking the brew.  He's got a thumbs up from Danny.  See, what we're trying to say, people, is that he drinks a little too much.  He's an alcoholic.  He's an alcoholic.  It's all how you look at it and who you're drinking with.  Hiding up some issues there, you see?  Wow, we have to run through five runner-up lines of the day?  Wow. 
[03:39:00]  I can't help why you make such a funny radio show.  It was just hysterical today.  It's a reward.  I have to tell you, today's show, top five ever.  Not a guest.  You're insane.  Not a fucking, and it was just fun from beginning to end today.  Hysterical.  What about 922 to 943?  What's up?  Dug.  What was that?  Line of the day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net,  the one site on the web that offers scouting and stats, 
[03:39:30]  live scoring, and personal customization,  and it's absolutely free to fantasy football fans everywhere.  BodogFantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Someone's saying it's called numbskull.  I'm going to keep track.  It's all about E-Rock today.  E-Rock numbskull.  He's got the numbskull.  You know, if someone out there wants to have a little fun,  they could keep track of how many insults E-Rock gets on a daily basis. 
[03:40:00]  That's a lot, man.  There you go.  Take that job out there.  That is a lot.  Here's another runner-up line of the E-D.  You know what I want to do with Bo Derek?  I want to have her put her hands between her legs like fists,  and I want to fuck her hands with grease,  and while I'm coming, just make fun of Dudley Moore's club foot and brain cancer.  That's just unnecessary.  Two down, three down.  No, it is hysterical.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  We got to say goodbye to Marge. 
[03:40:30]  Marge?  Marge?  Goodbye for good, gentlemen.  Bye.  For good?  Marge, but we wanted to cut open your clam and see how old you are.  Thank you.  Clam.  It's such a rank fucking word for the female genitalia.  Hey, do they talk about that?  A clam.  We got a dump list?  Yeah.  No, they didn't hear about that.  Let me see that.  Nice.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Well, thank you for talking to me for this long.  All right, thank you.  I would probably talk to you longer if I didn't have a guy with horse hooves typing in things 
[03:41:00]  and play them up on the screen.  That record rate.  Another E-Rock bashing.  Yeah.  Keep track.  I can't see that close, far, or whatever.  He's a fag?  The He's a fag sound clip.  Oh, God.  They're dumped.  The Sopranos clip, He's a fag.  What are we talking about?  They dumped that?  Steven S. Barbasher.  I was just having fun with him today.  Why'd they dump He's a fag?  Yeah, it was during the Jack-Jack reference and then... 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  That shouldn't have been dumped.  No.  No, of course not.  And then performing fellatio on Hurt twice.  Yeah, we understood that.  All right.  But how about talking to Tom tomorrow about that not being dumped?  How about Tracy talk to him?  Oh, we'll talk to her tomorrow.  Ask Tracy why He's a fag was dumped out of.  Yes.  Give her stuff to do.  That's right.  Stay out of my hair.  Exactly.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Hurt.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, I give Jimmy an award today.  I'm going to start giving out awards. 
[03:42:00]  For what?  Oh.  Showing, showing...  Wait, how did I say it?  Best restraint?  Best restraint of the day award goes out to little Jimmy Norton.  It'll be brought up.  You were this close.  Oh, believe me.  I know.  It has all the bounce of an anvil.  Best restraint of the day award to little Jimmy Norton.  Let me think if I want to give out any more awards today. 
[03:42:30]  Awards.  I got a boner.  Best boner.  No, I had one too today.  You had a boner?  A little one.  It was impressive when I was taking the leak earlier.  I was like, wow.  Where's the pal-to camera?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Danny Bonaduce didn't have no boner.  Let's hope not.  Here's the final runner-up line of the day.  Hit it.  She was walking out.  Migs threw something at her, so we called her back.  Look deep inside yourself, Tracy. 
[03:43:00]  Pantene.  Hey, Karen.  Hey, I'm just worried about E-Rock, and I wanted to...  Karen has the...  Hold on a minute.  Are you insane?  Oh, is she about to get a monumental teasing?  By that, by the way...  Teasing?  I'm not trying to split ends.  I just want to say that we should address it.  You shouldn't.  You know.  We will address it on the air.  Yeah.  All right.  And podogfantasy.net, thank you. 
[03:43:30]  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Now I just was informed I have to go for a sleep study.  So now there might be...  They should just come here and watch the work. 
[03:44:00]  Fuck.  Fuck, man.  E-Rock got beat up three out of six lines today.  That's all right.  Why shouldn't he be?  Absolutely.  Oh, wow.  Someone is suggesting...  This might be a lot of work, though.  Oh, go for it.  Uh-oh.  Instant feedback line of the day.  These guys would love that.  They're in competition.  Oh, wow.  Instant feedback line of the day?  That doesn't necessarily get red on air?  Or it does. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, that could be the tough part.  I don't know if we could handle that.  Yeah.  That's, uh, wow.  It probably should be red on the air.  Huh?  It probably should be red on the air.  Yeah.  This is my new character.  He never parts his teeth.  Why don't we have, like, Clinch Teeth Wednesday?  Yes.  Where we all have to talk with our teeth clenched for the whole day.  Except to lick our lips because our teeth will get dry.  There's nothing worse than dry teeth.  Yeah, your teeth will be all dry.  And your lips will be all dried out.  So you could stop and go like this. 
[03:45:00]  But you can't talk during the time that you're licking your lips.  It's a fun character.  Give it a try, Opie.  I don't want to.  Come on, Clinch Teeth Wednesday.  You'll love it.  You'll never want to go back.  Thand, what about you, Thand?  Just think of mother and talk.  Come on.  Die.  Die, bitch.  See?  It's like a anger thing.  Oh, I like it.  Why are you so mean?  And I can even drink my smoothie.  Some of the smoothie sounds today were downright disgusting, by the way. 
[03:45:30]  Jimmy said something that sounded like he had a load of cum in his throat.  It was just this big bubble of smoothie just going,  The sounds of the smoothie today were brutal.  Nice.  Oh, God.  Brutal.  You could hear it?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Really?  What?  When?  The first half of the show.  Of this side.  Really?  First half hour.  Oh, yeah.  Who had them?  Both of you guys.  Slurping or just? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, it was just like.  What?  I didn't even show.  Was it like.  Or was it just like.  It sounded like bubbly cum.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, it didn't taste like.  Can we go home?  Oh, okay.  Instead of smoothie sounds, I'll try this tomorrow.  Let's all just do this.  And then I'll do this.  Which I do anyway. 
[03:46:30]  I'll just do what I do.  And then someone had to go after me because my fucking battery is low again.  Who went after you?  Your battery hit.  Dying.  There's a few people on instant.  No worries.  I turned it off.  Moody.  I've been in here.  I've been in here.  I've got to go meet Pete.  I've got to go meet Pete.  Meet Pete.  And John.  We've got to talk business.  A bunch of men.  Business.  Take me with you, please.  Oh, where?  Going to a hotel.  To meet Pete. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Take me away from this, please.  Oh, it's a sweet.  Calgon, take me away.  Please take me away, would you?  Would you?  And then she told two friends.  And so on.  And she didn't listen.  And that one just left.  Exactly.  An empty cube where there should be another person.  That's right.  Now it's smoking.  All right, we're going to take a break from the show.  And we'll do this again tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[03:47:30]  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest.  The greatest of all time.  Ella.  Ella.  A.  A.  Yeah, we suck.  Oprah and Anthony, y'all. </pre>
