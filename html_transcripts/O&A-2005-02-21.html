<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a listener email detailing a 40-year-old woman's open marriage and bisexual lifestyle, including graphic details of her sexual encounters, some involving her husband’s participation and photography. Jim Norton had already met with her and shared details of their encounter.  Opie then recounted a highly detailed and graphic description of a recent digital rectal exam he received due to severe constipation, with implied audio of the procedure existing.

The show continued with a discussion about a taped conversation of President George W. Bush admitting to past marijuana use, followed by a nonsensical song on the same subject. This transitioned into ribald commentary on a television appearance of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and a discussion about the hosts' and Martini Steve's photos with Bill Clinton.  The conversation then veered wildly into discussions about flatulence, including detailed accounts from both the hosts and callers,  followed by a caller seeking Jim Norton’s advice on the differences between Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis.  Further discussion included Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up shows, a listener's birthday wish list for Martini Steve, an explicit audio clip from a pornographic video, Blockbuster's censorship, a caller’s story about a messy bowel movement while driving, and Anthony Cumia's upcoming poker game in Los Angeles.

The show then shifted to online poker, the prevalence of unsecured Wi-Fi networks, and the potential for accessing others' computers and printers. Callers Aaron and Eric contributed to this discussion, with Eric suggesting the hosts attend a hacker convention. The absence of a scheduled guest, Bob Kelly, was noted, followed by brief mentions of the deaths of Hunter S. Thompson and Sandra Dee.  The conversation then moved to a cruise featuring REO Speedwagon, Journey, and Styx, with photos of fans shown and a caller discussing a White Snake cruise with his parents.  This led to a discussion of Jim Norton's childhood, including a humorous anecdote about his father's kissing advice and a call from his concerned mother urging him to exercise.  A Cartman version of "Come Sail Away" was played, along with discussion of various bands.  The Katie Couric segment on teen sex was also discussed and clips played, followed by further discussions about the ease of accessing unsecured Wi-Fi and Jim Norton’s tour dates.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on teen sexuality, using a survey as a jumping-off point to discuss oral sex, virginity, "friends with benefits," and casual sexual encounters.  Numerous callers shared graphic and often vulgar stories about their sexual experiences, including a particularly explicit account from one listener and a discussion about a woman who cut off and flushed her boyfriend's penis down the toilet.  The hosts revisited the idea of a "Money Snatch" segment, involving nude women collecting money in their vaginas, with explicit details of a previous event.

The show concluded with a segment featuring a listener named "Fast Freddy" from Jamaica Station, who repeatedly requested sexually explicit content, prompting threats of a ban. The hosts discussed the possibility of bringing women into the studio for money, implying nudity and explicit acts in exchange for payment. Comments were made about Fast Freddy's appearance, and the segment ended abruptly with non-English words and phrases.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts engaged in numerous humorous exchanges and tangents, often fueled by listener calls.  The "Ramon" promos were also mentioned as a recurring comedic bit, along with the leak of Paris Hilton's cell phone contacts and pictures, and the SEC's investigation into Chauncey Hayden.

[00:05:00]  V.O.P.N.  V.O.P.N.  This guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[00:05:30]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Let me take a look.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Hey, what's going on, man?  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Jim Norton.  The only virus spreading across America.  I got to see the rest.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Oh.  We can get right into this.  Might as well.  One of us already did.  Jesus.  Yeah, where do we begin, man? 
[00:06:30]  God.  I called up Jim Norton last night.  I'm like, hey, Jim, man, I'm bored.  You want to get a bite to eat?  He's like, dude, I'd love to, but I'm banging this chick.  Well, or you just finished or something.  We just finished and we were at Starbucks.  Yeah.  Oh, you were at Starbucks?  Yeah, having a cup of Joe.  Why not?  Can't say your name, though, but.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Well, it was an email.  It started with an email that was sent to all of us, I guess.  Yeah.  I read this email.  Jim read this email.  If Anthony's mailbox wasn't full, he would have read this email. 
[00:07:00]  Why do I care?  And others got this damn thing.  I'll read it, okay?  Hi, guys.  Blank here.  I've been a long-time listener and really love your show.  I'm in a not-so-common situation, and many have told me that I would make a great guest on your show.  Well, here it goes.  I'm an attractive 40-year-old married bi-female who has a very understanding hubby who lets me play with others.  I've been a shared wife for most of my 21 years, married.  I did take a few years off to raise my son.  Oh, what a nice mom. 
[00:07:30]  What a gal.  He has no interest in betting other women.  His sole attention is me.  I, on the other hand, love to play.  I have had over 50 men, women, and couples, all of which hubby is aware of and most of whom he has met.  I am loyal to only him.  With others, it's just sex.  There is no cuddling, et cetera, et cetera.  Well, thank goodness.  That pretty much makes the marriage okay, then.  No kissing?  Yeah, we kiss, but we didn't cuddle afterwards.  If I was at her place, she would have kicked me out.  Really?  She's fantastic. 
[00:08:00]  You're like a whore.  Dude, she rolled over.  She was just so finished with me after.  Wow.  She's great.  Wow.  Yeah, and she writes in the email,  Do me and get out.  We have a great marriage, and our sex life is fantastic.  I don't want to bore you with a long, drawn-out email.  I do have tons of stories to tell.  Well, if you think this might make for some interesting on-air talk, please get back to me.  I live about 65 miles north of New York City, so getting to you is not a problem.  I'm not shy and have very few limits.  Pain and potty games are out.  Sorry, Jim. 
[00:08:30]  I have no qualms about getting naked.  I would also love to perform for you on the lesbian couch, if it's still around.  It is, by the way.  I'm going to attach a picture or two for your inspection.  Hubby is far from a professional photographer,  and everyone I've met say my pictures do not do me justice,  so please keep that in mind.  Thanks for your time.  Hope to hear from you.  Signed, blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  So, yeah, I got the email.  I gave it to Ben and Steve.  I'm like, well, yeah, I guess we could do something with this girl, you know? 
[00:09:00]  And little did I know at the time that she also emailed Jim,  and Jim aggressively pursued this right off the bat.  Well, of course.  Let me see these pictures again.  Well, I actually get so many crackpot emails like you guys do.  I didn't really believe it.  I'm like, come on.  So I emailed it back just because she's hot,  so I'm like, all right, let me email it back.  And she emailed me back, and we started chatting.  And usually it's like guys do it all the time.  They'll email you.  They'll go, hey, I'm a chick,  and they'll send you pictures off some website.  Yeah.  So with her, I'm like, we talked on the online for a few minutes,  and we talked on the phone. 
[00:09:30]  And she's like, she was going to come down, I think, that day.  She's like, I'll come down to the city on the train.  I'm like, oh, very nice.  But I couldn't because I think I had some gigs or something.  So we made plans for Sunday.  You're hysterical, man.  And lo and behold, if she didn't show up.  Yeah.  I had to, I slept all day, so I got up at like 3,  and I got a message from her saying I'm going to leave at 2.30.  So I'm like, oh, we missed each other because I didn't talk to her.  So I'm talking to her online, and she's like, well, I can come now.  I'm like, but I have shows at 9 o'clock. 
[00:10:00]  She's like, eh, so what?  You can just see I'm a real person.  We'll hang for a little while.  She's almost telling me, like, look, dumbbell,  I don't need to hang out and talk to you.  Hey, ass.  Is she attractive?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I can't really tell on these pictures because she looks older.  Yeah, she's 40 or 41.  She has an adult son.  I mean, she's been with the same guy for a long time.  Oh.  Oh, she's sexy.  Breast implants.  Yep.  Jim fucked your mom.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I said she's a MILF, and Steve said, no, she's an M-I-D-F. 
[00:10:30]  I'm like, yeah.  Mom, I did.  Oh.  A midf.  Right.  It was a little funnier when Steve said it.  Probably not, actually.  I was just so happy.  I'm in such a good mood today that everything just kind of makes me smile.  Well, yeah.  I can be handed a mealy apple, and I'd go, ah, I like them soft.  I'm looking at these pictures.  She's on her knees looking up at the camera with her breast implants and her big eyes.  In the background, I noticed there's, like, a wood heart.  I didn't even notice that.  I wonder if this was taken on Valentine's Day.  Oh, probably.  Maybe, right?  Some kind of wooden, like, heart thing in the background of that picture. 
[00:11:00]  And then she's topless with a little Catholic schoolgirl-type skirt on a pool table with  her panties around her ankles, and she's got, like, you know, spiked shoes on and all  that, and looking pretty good there.  And then is this her hubby?  I don't know.  I don't think that's her husband.  No, her husband takes the pictures, right?  Right.  I think that was, I don't believe that was her husband, the one holding her head there,  and about adenoids deep with his mule. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, I think that's, uh...  So this is one of the dudes she does, and the husband's taking the pictures?  The husband snaps a few off, and then there's another chick under her right there, huh?  Oh, there is?  You should see the gangbang footage she has.  Oh, okay.  That's a different chick.  Yeah, I thought she was...  Oh, I thought she was just very, uh...  Nimble.  Yeah.  No, that's another girl that she's apparently...  Oh, okay, so there's kind of like a 69 thing almost happening, but...  Right.  ...instead of reciprocating the other woman, she's doing the guy there. 
[00:12:00]  Hob.  Hob.  Hob.  Wow.  She has some great...  She has some, uh...  She told me she has like a thing on Adult Friend Finders, which I always think those profiles  are garbage.  Yeah.  But she said she's gotten like 90,000 views on this thing.  It's all guys on these profiles, and occasionally I guess she's a real...  She's a real chick.  And, uh, yeah.  Really nice.  Wow, so how was it?  Yeah, so what happened?  She comes, she shows up...  Well, she had sent me a couple of video clips she has gangbanging.  Her husband bought her, like, a four black guy gangbang for her birthday.  Really?  It's the greatest thing ever. 
[00:12:30]  Wait, the guy bought her four black guys, the banger?  For her, uh, birthday.  So what possesses a husband to do this?  I don't get it either, but apparently there are a lot of guys.  Um, and I've met a few couples like this.  Like, what's the problem?  What's the mental problem?  Because there is one.  What would drive a guy to want to...  You know, some are mother issues, some are, you know, child abuse issues.  What's the issue that would drive a man to love a woman and then invite four Negroes over to have sex with her? 
[00:13:00]  And where do you find the four Negroes?  They actually had some kind of site.  Um, I don't know either, because I'm too...  Chappelle's show?  Is that the site?  Yeah, I thought I recognized Charlie Murphy.  I saw the ring holding a big cock.  I'm like, I've seen that before.  Oh yeah, I shook hands with it.  I don't know.  It's like, but again, I'm such a weirdo in bed too, so it's like there's something there to it. 
[00:13:30]  But it's common enough with couples that it's...  There's something there.  I think it's a submission in the guy's part.  There is absolutely some kind of submission thing there.  Something.  She's very sexy in bed, man.  She comes over, we're sitting there.  She's very...  She's wearing like this...  Because it's cold out, she's wearing the high boots and like a long past the knees skirt, form fitting.  She's a great body.  Yeah.  And we're talking on the couch, and we just start making out, like five minutes into it.  Ah, quick.  Yeah, well, you know, she's an adult.  She's not 20.  I didn't need the whole, like, let's go get coffee nonsense. 
[00:14:00]  Over at your place?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, nice.  Um, she didn't even want to see the rest of the place.  She could care less.  I think she wanted to make sure I wasn't a psycho, and her husband actually talked to her while I was there.  She's like, look, I'll get naked, but I have to wait for the phone call.  She's like, we have to...  I have to talk to him first, so I know I'm all right.  There's a system?  Well, apparently...  This is so weird, man.  Apparently, what will happen is he'll call, and just to make sure she's, uh, okay.  She's like, they have...  She's like, just in case you're odd, or whatever, there's like an out.  She didn't like me, or if I was a jerk, she could have... 
[00:14:30]  Like, he'd call, and she'd pretend it's an emergency, and then she'd leave.  Right.  That's going to be out.  Gotcha.  Um, and I'm sure he has the address and all the information, phone number, whatever else.  So, uh, he called, and I hear him, he's on speakerphone.  He's like, you all right?  And she's like, yeah, I'm fine.  And then, uh, they said, I love you.  And she hung up the phone.  Oh, Jesus.  And then you...  Did he sound, like, kind of jealous?  No.  In his tone?  No.  No, no, no.  Because she told me, I asked her afterwards, if he asked you that, like, uh, I don't want  to do this anymore, I'm not comfortable with this, she said she'd stop without, without, 
[00:15:00]  uh, she was like, I'd stop immediately.  It's just something they're both into, and, uh, she's pretty no bullshit, so I believe  her.  How could he be into, like, like, you can, you can almost understand in that sick way, the  guy sitting there watching, if you have these, like, mental issues.  Is that, you have to see that.  But what's in it for him, if she's away, miles away, banging a comic?  Well, uh, I would say a Joe Craftsman, if you want to put it that way, that's probably 
[00:15:30]  how they were to the two.  I would, I, I think, that he would go back, or she would go back, and describe to him  in detail what happened.  Ah.  Because I knew another woman that would kind of do that, she was into coming over, and  she would, I wouldn't, uh, she would just kind of perform oral sex, and she said her  husband loved to hear about it, when she would, uh, go home.  She would just talk about everything she did.  Yeah.  And I can kind of, I can't understand that in the, in the context of, I wouldn't want  a girl I was dating, having, or married to, having sex with somebody else, but just being 
[00:16:00]  talked to, like, for instance, when this, uh, woman and I were kissing and fooling around,  and then she starts going down on me.  And this was minutes after she hung up with the husband.  Oh, yeah, yeah, dude.  It's amazing.  I love you.  As her finger was hitting the end button, my mouth was on her neck, and I was feeling her  fine breasts and large nipples.  I'm very happy with myself, I might add.  And, uh, she takes off her, uh, clothes, and she's, uh, she's like, just take it out.  Oh, of course I did.  Wow, really?  Right to the point.  Absolutely no bullshit with her.  And, uh, she starts going down on me, and it's just, it's fantastic. 
[00:16:30]  And, um, we start kissing again, we go into my room, and I have to go down on her, and  it's just, it's, it's, it's, like, that kind of noise just from touching it.  It's, you know the type of girl who gets, it gets so wet, it sounds like, like, rubber  shoes and mud when you touch it.  So she was really, like, turned on by her.  Oh, my, dude, for real.  It was just, it was fantastic.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  So I was performing oral treats on her, and then, uh, you know, we're kissing a little  bit, and we start having sex, and she turns me over, and just climbs on top.  Wow.  Oh, was it good.  Like, oh, and she's, the whole time we're kissing, and she's telling me that she's going  to strap one on, and, uh, and hit me with it.  Whoa.  And she's like, uh, she says to me, like, you ever, you ever, uh, had someone strap one  on?  And I was honest with her.  I'm like, no.  But I don't know why it turned me on when she was telling me this.  It was just so, she's like.  So filthy? 
[00:17:30]  She's kind of holding my, like, I'm on my back, and she's kind of holding my arms a  little bit, and telling me how she's going to come over, and she's going to strap one  on, and, uh, I've had that opportunity.  What a sicko.  Oh, that's good egg.  A good egg now.  Sicko.  What a sicko.  Well, you know, who's her, sicker her, or me for just coming like a busted sprinkler head,  as they say.  You mean, if I resist, you won't let me up?  No.  Brr!  And I've had girls offer to do that, and I've never allowed anyone to do that, because 
[00:18:00]  it's just, again, it's just not my thing.  That's the stimulation, it just doesn't do it for me.  Sure.  But it was just her telling me that, and then I'm just kissing, and she looked at me in  the eye, and she meant it.  And it was just driving me crazy.  Wow.  So that was my, uh, day yesterday.  And then what happened?  Like, she was gone, oh no, you went to Starbucks.  Yeah, we hung out for a little while.  She would have hopped on the, it was, that was like 7.15 at night.  She would have jumped on a train at 7.50, but she was really cool.  I wanted to hang with her and get the story.  Really.  Um, and find out what had gone on, and she was open about it, and she's like, um, told 
[00:18:30]  me how they met.  She's like, he's the first guy, her husband's the first guy she ever slept with.  They met when they were, she was 14, he was 17, they were in high school together.  High school sweethearts.  They got married.  She's like, she told me the whole progression of it, and it was just the way it went for  them.  What was the, uh, first one?  Uh, I think they were married for a little while before it even came up, and they would kind  of talk about it in bed.  Which I used, I've, I've had sex with girlfriends before, where I've had them fantasize about  having sex with other guys.  Could I actually watch it?  No.  But to see them, like, used as a sexual object by somebody would be kind of sexy and fantasy. 
[00:19:00]  But as far as watching it, I couldn't do it.  I'm too jealous.  Jesus.  I would never be able to do that.  I would never be able to do that.  There is just some twisted thing in the mind that, for a guy to do that, it's just, uh,  wow.  I couldn't watch it, though.  I could never, I, I had a threesome one time with a girlfriend, and just watching her  with another girl, kind of like, I was cool with it, but you know, it was still like a  little weird to somebody else.  So I know I couldn't go with this. 
[00:19:30]  I'd just, I'd be too freaked out.  Turn it off.  Yeah, exactly.  Turn it off.  Really.  Because, you know, Florentine's lifestyle, he lives like Tiberius Caesar, the type of threesomes  he has.  Just the hottest chicks alive.  And one time.  Fulls of lard.  It's really, yeah, infant suckling.  Tiberius would actually do that.  He was a real creep.  And, uh, Jim one time told me that he hooked up with this couple, and, uh, the, the wife,  because the husband just watched, apparently. 
[00:20:00]  And Jim was working with the wife.  And I've watched Jim have sex.  And if there's one guy you don't want banging your girlfriend, it's Florentine.  What a professional he is.  It was just, we were in North Carolina one time, years ago.  And I hook up with a girl, and me and Jim kind of like played good cop, bad cop, because  it was a fat girl trying to cock block both of us.  And we both kind of block out the fatty and help each other.  So I got one girl in my bed.  He's got one in his bed.  And I think the fat girl just kind of stayed downstairs at the, at the restaurant.  And I'm with the one, I can't get a rod. 
[00:20:30]  I'm so self-conscious about my fat gun.  I have my clothes on.  And he's banging this other one in the bed.  It was a work of art.  She's on her stomach.  And he's just, and he's just grumbling on his arms.  What a professional.  And I'm sitting there, my dick is like, it's like a straight pig's tail.  It's just thin and horrible and not working.  I went down on her for about three hours.  I was just completely dysfunctional.  I just would never allow him to bang my girl. 
[00:21:00]  So that's the risk you take in doing that.  That is funny, man.  That's great.  So, and does she, how many times does she do this a week?  Not as often.  She said that she's had about a little over 50 guys in her life.  She said she has a lot of sex, but she does it with the same people consistently.  And I actually watched clips of the guys, like the Black Gang Bang, and they all had bags on.  So she said she's just like diseased paranoid.  And she pretty much keeps it with consistent partners.  Like they have this little circle of people or whatever, like all the married people. 
[00:21:30]  And she's really open about it.  And she's got pictures up and some streaming video.  Oof.  Jeez.  Well, we're going to have to get her on the air now.  Oh, yeah.  She's willing to come on?  Dude, she's a fantastic, she's for real.  Yeah, she wants to come on.  I didn't know if I could like, I'm like, can we post some of the pictures on Foundry?  And I'm like, she's like, yeah.  I'm like, you sure?  And she's like, yeah, cool.  Wow.  She's totally okay with it.  All right, we'll get some photos up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  But you have her number?  We should talk to her today, a little later or something. 
[00:22:00]  Get her side of this.  I can check the email.  I may have it in the email.  I don't know.  If I don't, I'll have to give it to you tomorrow because it's on my home palm.  But I didn't transfer it to my stupid cell phone yet.  So there you go.  I just wanted dinner last night.  And Jimmy was all excited.  Dude, you're not going to believe this.  I'm so freaking happy.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Like, all right.  Yeah, it was a...  Can I have some water, mister?  Wow.  It was a good end to a fine weekend.  More of your sexual adventures. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Very normal one, too.  Yeah, well, for you.  Yeah.  So I just laid there like a lump.  She was great.  I was mediocre to awful.  Just laying there like a stiff diving board while she did all the work.  Kiss me and talk and my toes are pointed straight out.  And I'm playing with my own nipples just listening.  You mean you wouldn't let me up?  No.  Blah!  Blah!  She originally had my hands pinned, but of course then I had to tease the old nips.  Of course.  I think I have audio of you screwing last night.  Wow.  I had a hidden mic. 
[00:23:00]  Hidden mic in Jim's apartment.  All right.  Wow. 
[00:23:30]  I have no idea what that's from.  Steve just handed it in today.  Jiminy Cricket.  All it says is loud screwing audio.  I bet it didn't sound like that, did it?  No, because that would imply that the man did some work.  I was just laying there.  It kind of sounded like, because she was so physically excited,  it sounded like, it was like, you know what a paint roller sounds like?  When you rub it like...  Yeah, exactly, it makes that sound.  I was so turned on that I could actually hear it.  When you could actually hear it, that's how you know the other person. 
[00:24:00]  That's funny.  Let's go to Cap in Carolina.  Cap, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Cap.  You know, I found it interesting that you thought this was kind of all gross,  just Norton here.  But you know, if it was a 17-year-old girl banging a black drug dealer  and her dad called up in the middle of it, you'd think it's hot.  Well, you're correct about that, sir, but I didn't say this was gross.  You sounded kind of weird out.  You're like, this whole system's a little bit messed up.  No, I'm intrigued by the whole thing.  I'll tell you what I think is messed up is that the guy is at home just allowing this. 
[00:24:30]  I couldn't imagine doing that.  Yeah.  I couldn't imagine just sending my chick off to bang guys  and then have her come back to me and describe the whole thing to me  and that's going to turn me on or whatever.  No way.  I couldn't do that.  But I think it's hot that she's into that without a doubt.  I think it's really hot that she's got this open relationship  and, you know, she's going out there banging other guys.  But to be the actual guy she's coming home to, forget that, man.  Well, I agree with you there. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  I'm punching out, Negro.  All right, man.  Man.  A little odd.  Yeah, I couldn't do it, I don't think.  But that's hard, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I thought I had a cute little story to start the show today, but Jimmy trumped me.  Oh.  What was your story?  I'm sure your story's cute and nice.  Is it similar?  Well, I got action, too.  Oh.  I called Anthony.  I had him laughing so freaking hard.  Oh.  Action.  Well, I told you that on Friday that, you know, I finally had to go to the doctor for this. 
[00:25:30]  Jimmy just starts laughing immediately.  That is exactly the same thing, by the way.  You go there, and then you call and tell your partner exactly what happened.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Anthony, I got a story for you.  You ready?  I love you.  Are you ready, Ant?  This is what's going to turn you on.  Yeah.  This is going to help our relationship.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, you know, I've been talking about it off and on about the constipation, so I went to the doctor.  Ugh.  My doctor that I've been, you know, with for like six or seven years.  Yeah, my doctor, Vinnie Boombat.  Um, because, you know, it was getting so bad, I was getting really bad headaches from time to time.  And all those toxins backing up.  Toxins backing up.  And then I was getting like a slight like, a slight like, um, kind of like, uh, heartburn.  Yeah.  Type of thing.  And that's what made me really nervous.  So I went to the doctor.  He hooked me up to an EKG immediately. 
[00:26:30]  I'm like, dude, just, you know, make sure the EKG's cool, which it was.  You're just backing up.  Yeah, backing up bad.  I'm going in for a full physical in two weeks, but, but all the symptoms were, yeah, you're just really constipated.  Because he's asking me, I'm like, dude, sometimes I go two, three days without even going.  And he's like, that's what's going on, man.  And you're, and then he, he felt around my abdomen and stuff.  I was like, wow, man, you got a lot in there.  Big adobe factory.  Oh, yeah.  So I was very relieved that we were able to figure it out.  Very relieved.  You know, he's like, yeah, the headaches are from the toxins building up most likely. 
[00:27:00]  Uh, you know, but he did a couple of little tests just to make sure on that.  And then he checked the, you know, the EKG for the heart.  He's like, yeah, your heart looks really good.  And then, uh, you know, he's feeling around the abdomen.  He's like, yeah, you're right.  You diagnosed yourself perfectly.  I'm like, and I'm all relieved.  Right.  And then he's like, you know, you need to start taking some Metamucil or whatever.  Metamucil.  And then something called a softener.  Oh, God.  It's called a softener. 
[00:27:30]  Softener.  He doesn't believe in laxatives, but he believes in these softeners.  Softener.  Because he was asking me, you know, what kind of, when I do go, how bad it is.  I'm like, dude, it's like concrete.  It's thin.  It's just awful, you know.  He goes, oh, you need softeners.  Here's the three I recommend, right?  You don't want Haagen-Dazs in the freezer for a week.  You want Carville's softener.  So then I get up off his little, you know, table slash whatever you call that, the examining 
[00:28:00]  freaking thing.  And I'm all relieved, and I'm pretty much getting ready to head out the door.  And he goes, but I just want to make sure.  Oh, no.  I thought I was, you know, home free.  I thought I was home free, man.  I'm like, what do you mean?  Like the hostage.  You go home today.  What do you mean?  And dress you up, take you out to the car, and then go, not today.  I go, what do you mean you want to make sure?  And that's when, I wish I had some dramatic music.  I forgot to tell Eric to load that today.  Do you have the, any psycho music or anything like that? 
[00:28:30]  Might have something.  Might have something good?  All right.  You all loaded it?  I don't know if this will work, but, and that's when.  Yeah, yeah, that'll work.  So I'm heading toward the door.  He goes, well, I just want to make sure, you know.  I'm like, what does that mean?  And I turn, because I'm sort of out the door.  Yeah.  Like, I'm reaching for the handle, and I turn.  And that's when I see, with his back turned to me.  Putting on the glove. 
[00:29:00]  Not the glove.  And then it's going through your head.  What other things could he use the glove for?  Can't be just that.  And then he knows it's awkward.  You know, he knows who I am, which I think makes it a little stranger for him, you know.  O.P.?  Right.  By the way, when I went into the doctor's office, I got to back up just a little bit.  One of the ladies that works there, she's about, you know, in her early 30s, I guess. 
[00:29:30]  She works at the office.  She can't believe I'm there.  She's freaking out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fan of the show.  I listen to you and Anthony every morning.  And I'm like, so you were listening this morning.  She goes, yes.  And I'm like, so you know I'm here because I can't crap.  She's like, yes.  And I'm like, oh, this is just great, you know.  So then he's reaching for the glove, and he can't even look at me.  He's like.  Of course not.  He's like, all right, just drop your pants.  I'm like, doc, no way.  I go, you know I'm going to have to talk about this on the air.  He goes, you better not. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, I have to.  Are you kidding me?  So he's like, drop your jeans and your, you know.  You romp them.  Your undies.  And then he goes, all right, lean.  Lean forward.  Oh, no.  Dude, I can't even look him in the eye.  I'm like, lean forward.  I understand because I can't even look you in the eye when you're saying this.  He goes, lean forward, lean on your elbows, and take a deep breath.  Here it comes. 
[00:30:30]  What are you doing, motherfucker?  What are you doing, motherfucker?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Damn.  That's bad.  Ha-ha.  Damn.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, are you so upset?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:31:30]  Ah.  Thank you.  You asses.  So please continue with this testimony from the Colby trial.  So then I, when last we left you, you were bent over, taking a deep breath.  And so I lean over on my elbows, and I'm in, I guess I'm in the position.  I guess I'm in the ideal position.  And it was pretty much like Chevy Chase and Fletch, you know, it was time to sing Moon River. 
[00:32:00]  This is a giant cock.  He goes, I take a deep breath, I take a deep breath, he goes, exhale, and then, oof.  And then it happened.  Oh.  Then it happened.  And then he has to do, I'm sure, the old doctor joke when he was done.  He goes, I hope I didn't change your lifestyle.  I'm like, oh, God.  And then, you know, he goes, all clear.  I'm like, oh, gee, thanks.  All clear.  And then I pull up my jeans. 
[00:32:30]  All clear.  And all of a sudden, now he has his back turned to me again, and he's washing off in the sink and taking off the glove.  And I felt like such an idiot.  Could you just stand there by yourself?  Now you're going to lean over and clean the load off your shoe by yourself?  I was worried about all that crap.  I didn't feel any of that.  Because I've heard rumors about that shit, right?  Oh, prostate?  Yeah.  You get the prostate tickled a little, and you're dumping. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, God.  Not dumping, dumping.  You're dumping a load.  Stop.  But I was relieved that, you know, none of that was going on.  I'm like, all right.  That would be perfect.  I got audio of the moment.  Oh.  Oh.  That's actually audio of the doctor. 
[00:33:30]  So, of course, as soon as I leave the damn place, I've got to call my pal.  I'm like, Anthony?  Yeah.  I'm not a virgin anymore.  Oh, you took it.  Anthony starts laughing his ass off.  Did it hurt?  Was there pain? 
[00:34:00]  It was just really, I can't really describe it.  It was kind of just uncomfortable.  I would assume it would be uncomfortable.  It didn't hurt, per se.  There wasn't any real pain?  No, it's just a very uncomfortable thing.  Oh, it certainly sounds like it would be.  Oh, God.  It gives you the feeling that you need to dump.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Move.  So, there you have it.  Wow.  I figured I'd share today. 
[00:34:30]  Phew.  That's rough.  Huh?  That's rough.  I should have shot a log right in his hand.  That would teach him.  Mess up that glove of his.  Let's go to Bob on Long Island.  Bob, what's up?  Oh, Steve, in the medical field, we talk about that after you leave the office.  Everybody talks about you.  Everybody smiles at you, thinks, hey, you know, I'm ready to go to him.  Everybody's talking about you.  Tell us.  Go on your phone.  You're on the phone. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Who is screwing with the phones?  Thanks, Bob.  Who is screwing with the phones?  Get Mars in here immediately.  Get him in here immediately.  It's these two right here, but I'm not going to touch him.  Who is messing with our phone system again?  Mars.  Mars.  Immediately.  Bring him in.  Wasn't there a pre-show test run?  Yeah, and they were fine.  Okay.  Someone is messing with our studio when we're not here.  It's these two buttons over here, right?  Buttons?  Or these two knobs?  Someone screwed with our phones, Mars. 
[00:35:30]  It's these buttons right here, right?  Yes, sir.  The knobs?  One to the left, one to the right, or no?  They're right, though.  They were in the right position.  They were in the right position.  You just made a slight adjustment.  Let's call and see what happens.  Oh, God.  Let's go to Lance on Long Island.  Lance, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Every day I'm driving to work from Long Island, and there goes Opie.  Start talking about taking a crap, and now I've got to go.  I'm by the Cross Island Park with about a half an hour from work.  I've got to go. 
[00:36:00]  Every morning.  Well, I think this is the end of that little soap opera.  This whole show is little soap operas that come and go, and I think finally that'll be the end of that.  That storyline.  All right, that storyline is done.  That's what I was thinking.  Thanks for calling, Lance.  Thanks, Lance.  All right.  Lance.  So it worked out for you?  The softener?  Yeah, Saturday I took easily six.  Massive.  Oh, God.  Massive.  Where you just are amazed that that was in you. 
[00:36:30]  Just absolutely amazed.  I was like, there's no way all this was in me.  Toilet looks like Fallujah.  Your column's going to wind up in the Muter Museum.  All right, why don't we take a quick break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar.  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray. 
[00:37:00]  Ramon.  Open your mouth.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  Oh, ah, ah, ah.  Hey, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[00:37:30]  Snowing here in New York City.  It's a snowy morning.  Well, it doesn't matter because everyone has off except for us today.  Oh, yeah.  What is it, President's Day?  Yeah, the streets are dead.  In honor of President's Day, we got President Bush talking about marijuana.  One of the big stories today.  Smoked some pot.  We all knew that, though.  That was a total partier in college.  Somebody taped one of his phone calls before he was president, I guess. 
[00:38:00]  What a great guy.  What a great pal to have.  Tapes your conversations and then tells everybody what you said, releases them.  Yeah, releases it to the media and says something like, well, I had to release this because it's part of history because he's a president.  Now, this guy wanted a little attention, huh?  Of course.  Before we get to that, because they're going to bring that audio in a few minutes, we played another Ramon promo going into break.  Ramon.  The whole Steve Ramon thing, which is a little creepy.  Yeah.  You want to explain it really fast because Steve's not here. 
[00:38:30]  He just made these...  I mean, he's here, but he's somewhere else.  These promos for the show featuring this rich, eccentric voiceover guy and his houseboy Ramon.  I don't know where he thinks this stuff up, but he did.  And it's turning into a little series.  Yeah, well...  He made a few of these, and Ramon is the manservant of this voiceover guy.  In the latest episode, Ramon has to open up his mouth because this voice guy has to, you know...  Flick his cigar ash. 
[00:39:00]  Flick his cigar ash somewhere.  So he decides he needs to flick it in Ramon's mouth.  Yeah.  This is from Steve, who works for us, Martini Steve.  Uh-huh.  There's something going on in his head.  So anyway, there's three or four of those promos that he's made.  Now the listeners have started making Ramon promos.  Yeah.  So we got Cigars and Scotch.  This is the Steve and Ramon Sweeper by Cigars and Scotch.  Right?  Uh, nothing beats sitting back and enjoying a few martinis. 
[00:39:30]  Ramon, get me a new liver.  Great production values.  You know, it's average at best, but I think this is going to start something with the listeners.  I kind of like that.  I think they're going to start sending in their Ramon promos. 
[00:40:00]  Just as Steve has this whole, like, homoerotic degradation.  Like, the first thing, he diuretically evacuates into his shoes and Ramon has to clean it.  And now he needs Ramon's mouth as an ashtray.  He's like a weird type of, like, a master, like a dominatrix.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because again, there was a problem and Ramon had to use his sleeve to clean up the crap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's always something going on.  But I like this.  The guy's implying that Martini Steve is, uh, uh, uh, hammered. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Well.  Making a little too many martinis, screwing up his liver.  We look forward to more sweepers from the listeners.  Great job.  The Ramon saga continues.  That'll annoy Steve quick.  Oh, of course it will.  I don't know why they have to send these in.  Perfect.  I know I'm cozy.  Yeah, Mark Breno, Ramon.  That'll somehow make Ramon a guy who did coke with Bledsoe when he was in Boston.  Yeah, Porcel is firing on it. 
[00:41:00]  Ramon.  Come on.  Come on, buddy.  Enough.  I also got an email from these guys over the weekend.  And they were very excited because they thought they were the only ones that got, uh, Paris Hilton's.  Oh, I know.  Friend's cell phone.  Everyone got that.  Yeah, that, that story is in all the major papers.  But, uh, I think it was Eric Starr, like, all excited that he had Paris Hilton's cell phone.  Would have been nice if it, you know, the story broke, uh, when we were on the air, you know.  Then we could have called some of these things and maybe gotten them on the, on the phone. 
[00:41:30]  But, uh, by the time you get to two days later, all these guys have turned off their phones, had them changed.  They're, they're all pissed off.  But, you know, I had Lindsay Lohan and, uh, who else was on there?  Eminem.  I left him a message, actually.  I think he's going to call me back.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm like, I'm not like these other fans, man.  I just want to tell you what you mean to me.  So, sort through the 8,000 other messages you have.  Ashley Simpson.  Avril Lavigne.  Which Olsen twin?  I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  I don't even know.  Matt Sorum worked.  We called Matt Sorum this morning.  That one worked.  Who's Matt Sorum?  Vin Diesel.  Who's Matt Sorum?  Who is he?  Yeah, who is he again?  Drummer.  Oh, drummer from, uh, Guns N' Roses.  Dolber Revolver, yeah.  Dolber Revolver, right.  Well, he's hoping he's getting phone calls.  Well, see, he's one of the ones, though.  And then there's all these, like, nightclub people from New York and all these, like, social  lights.  Nobody knows who they are, but theirs all still worked.  I called all those.  Christina Aguilera.  Her doctor.  So, how did this get out?  I don't know.  Eric would know.  Eric, how did the Paris Hilton thing get out?  Um, I woke up yesterday morning and somebody said, oh, somebody hacked into her, uh, that 
[00:42:30]  sidekick that she does the commercials for.  They didn't actually hack into the sidekick.  They hack into, what you do is, uh, you hotlink with your computer and you could put in numbers  and everything over your computer.  But what you're doing is, you're, you're uploading everything from your sidekick onto  a private website on T-Mobile's, uh, server.  Okay.  So, all that information goes onto a server.  So, then, let's say you, you get your sidekick wiped out. 
[00:43:00]  It doesn't work anymore.  You can just plug it into the computer and you don't have to re-enter everything.  All your info is there.  Oh.  Can I, can I be really stupid?  What's a sidekick?  It's, uh, like a Blackberry or something like that.  Those things you see on the, you've seen the commercials before where she's punching in  and Snoop Dogg is asking how much conditioner I should do or fabric softener.  Well, to either that or it's a black woman who laughs at everything you say.  Someone hacked into my sidekick. 
[00:43:30]  Very funny, Jimmy.  So, yeah, they hacked into that website which has all that information on it and got some  pictures of her.  A couple of naked pictures.  Her kissing some girl in a  bathroom in a hotel. Yeah. Her naked  kissing some chick in a hotel bathroom.  That was kind of hot. Picture of her  with Burt Reynolds was pretty funny, too. Yeah, yeah.  Picture of her with Burt Reynolds. Just dopey stuff.  Do we have those pictures up on FoundryMusic.com  yet? Steve has them.  See if we'll put them up. We definitely should. 
[00:44:00]  Eric was so conspiratorial in his email, too.  He gave me the links. He's like,  not, like capital N-O-T,  not for, like, not published  like these were secrets. Yeah, like we were  going to put it up on websites and like it would  matter. There's 8 billion sites  with these things on it now. Two people have it.  Eric and Drudge.  That's why  I was laughing. If Eric  has it, that means it's all over the world  at this point. Yeah, Drudge. Yeah.  I mean, we have no real good inside  you know. No. 
[00:44:30]  It was, like I said, if  the story broke when we were on the air, we probably  would have gotten through to a couple of these people.  But a couple of hours goes by,  everyone, you know how many phone calls  these people probably got? The Christina Aguilera  number? You know?  Who isn't calling that one?  Now what do you get?  If you call... Most of them have...  We called early Sunday morning  and most of them were already disconnected.  But we got through to Lindsay Lohan's voicemail.  Yeah. And somebody hacked her voicemail  and said, Lindsay Lohan is now owned.  And then he's just laughing and then the thing ends. 
[00:45:00]  We got through to Vin Diesel. You hear his voice.  But then when it goes to the mailbox,  it just says the mailbox full with like  6,000 something messages in it.  What could you possibly leave him a message?  He's probably got 5,000 messages going,  Jeep, you stink.  Boop, you're awful.  Boop, you suck.  But how do they hack?  So it's up at this website.  Yeah, and like any other website,  you can get into it.  And then someone's just fooling around  and then figured it out.  Yep. All right.  Hacked it.  But now the FBI's involved 
[00:45:30]  and apparently they got a line on who this is.  The SEC's involved.  Why would the Securities and Exchange Commission  be involved in that?  I think they're busy with something else.  Yeah, with that liar.  I got to say, though,  when it comes to stuff like that,  and this is how dumb I am,  when you guys came back from,  I knew you guys were going to D.C.  to talk to XM  and I knew it looked really good.  And like a jackass,  I didn't go out and get stock.  I own no stock in anything.  Why didn't I? 
[00:46:00]  How stupid am I?  Well, they might have nailed you  on insider trading.  Like the stock really went up when we...  But you know what I'm saying?  You should be allowed to do that.  Someone should look at XM stock.  It went up nice when we signed.  I think it was a bump.  Because there was a bunch of things  going on at the same time  and it looked like we were heroes back then.  The problem isn't so much  buying the stock  with some insider info.  It probably won't get you in trouble.  Well, if you bought it and held it.  You just hold on to it. 
[00:46:30]  It's these people  that have the inside info.  They buy it  and then right after it shoots up,  they off it.  You know, they sell it,  pocket a bunch of cash  and then the SEC looks into that.  It's like, wait a minute.  Who do you know?  How did this guy know  to buy this many shares  and sell it right after it went up?  So, Chauncey Hayden,  douchebag extraordinaire,  and I love how they say  self-proclaimed celebrity journalist.  Right. 
[00:47:00]  Self-proclaimed.  The guy writes for a rag magazine  and he's a fraud.  We did two interviews with the guy  and he redid our answers  and redid questions at times.  Get stuff wrong.  Badmouths Howard to us  while he's sitting with us  doing an interview.  Runs back to his butt buddy Howard  and badmouths us to him.  He's just a snake.  He's not the least bit sincere.  He probably doesn't have  a single friend in the world  because he's such a phony load of shit. 
[00:47:30]  And the SEC now is investigating him  because they want to know  if he had any inside information  on Howard going serious  and maybe acted on it.  Maybe told some of his buddies.  Like maybe heard something  in the office.  Maybe they made money.  Yeah.  Well, he says he went to Sirius  and asked whoever was interviewing him  for a job.  He went there for a job.  Said whoever was interviewing him  for a job,  he asked them,  is Opie and Anthony  coming to Sirius?  And whoever was interviewing him 
[00:48:00]  said,  no, we're holding out for Howard.  This is what Chauncey said.  This is what Chauncey said.  Once again, lying.  This guy, all he does is lie.  He's a fraud.  Yeah.  So he took,  you know,  he had that information,  he says,  with him.  And what he did with it  is what the SEC  is going to look into.  And the reality with us,  Sirius made us  an interesting offer.  I'm not going to say  a great offer.  And we could have  easily went there.  They weren't waiting  for Howard at this point.  We could have went there. 
[00:48:30]  And what happened was  XM came along  and just literally  just blew us out of the water  with their offer.  And then Sirius was  trying to play catch-up.  And they never got to the level  that XM was willing  to go for us.  No.  That's what happened.  They weren't waiting  for Howard.  But once again,  this Chauncey Hayden  is going to lie  and adjust the information  so it makes him look good.  Yeah.  So we have to see.  And, you know,  I would assume  they're going to question  a couple other people. 
[00:49:00]  And usually the SEC  doesn't jump in  if it's just  what the information is  that we've read in the paper.  There's got to be  something else.  Somebody  that perhaps  Chauncey knows  bought some stock  very low,  offed it right after  Howard announced  he was going to sign  and the stock went up.  So, you know,  there's something going on there.  Chauncey insists  he didn't buy any stock.  He doesn't own any stock  except in some 401k plan.  But that doesn't matter  if you then get info  and tell your buddy 
[00:49:30]  and he buys the stock,  it's still, you know,  you're still guilty  of insider trading.  Well, I heard they have  a recording actually  of Chauncey  yelling at somebody  and grabbing him  and saying,  I taught you the value  of insider information  and how to get it.  And then punching him  in Central Park.  Wow.  Yeah, that sounds familiar.  Yeah, so this is going to,  I guess the newspapers  have the headline,  Stock Shock.  Stock Shock Shock.  It's some ridiculous  headline like that. 
[00:50:00]  Well, it's just amazing  that Chauncey Hayden  continues to lie  and people aren't  on to him yet.  Self-proclaimed  celebrity journalist.  Like, they're not even  considering him  a celebrity journalist.  It's like,  well, he calls himself this.  He's been in, you know,  this whatever it is,  business for years  and years and years  and has advanced  not one footstep.  He has been this  free publication rag writer  for years  and hasn't even been  able to use it, 
[00:50:30]  his relationship  with Stern  or anybody else  to advance his career  to maybe getting  a paid gig  at People or something.  We've got to read  our old interview  that he did  off with us  because he would ask  stuff like,  so what do you guys  think of, you know,  other radio guys  out there?  And we would just  have a blanket statement  and then he changes  the question to,  so what do you think  of Howard?  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  he didn't have the balls  to actually ask us  to our face.  He's like,  yeah,  what do you think  of other radio guys  in Afternoon Drive  that you're competing against? 
[00:51:00]  It was such a just,  you know,  whatever.  And then the thing  comes out,  like,  he didn't ask us  about Howard Stern,  you know?  Yeah.  There were so many things  that were just not accurate  and right  in these interviews  that he did with us.  It was just amazing.  He's a lying douchebag.  He's got his little  relationship with Howie  and it's done him  nothing over the years.  It's done him nothing.  It's gotten him nowhere.  He's a loser.  And,  oh,  I just hope  they could dredge up something 
[00:51:30]  because the thought  of him going to jail  is really funny.  That would be good.  Maybe he could run  the prison newspaper.  It'll be a step up  from the rags  he writes for now.  All right.  Well,  that's a developing story  here in New York.  we'll keep our eye  on that one.  Oh,  yeah,  we will.  All right,  we got the audio  of President Bush,  Anthony.  So,  what's the deal  with this story?  Who was this guy  that taped  the phone conversation?  Some friend of his.  Just a friend? 
[00:52:00]  Just a friend.  Let's see.  A friend of the Bush family  who secretly recorded  nine hours of conversations  with George W. Bush  says he never intended  for the tapes  to become public  but felt he had a duty  to accurately represent  a man who he believed  would one day  become president.  So?  It was just a friend?  That's not a friend.  And there's nothing  huge in this.  We knew we smoked pot.  And the reason  he was taping for nine hours  he was waiting  for that one nugget.  The bombshell.  That one little thing  that he could use.  Yep.  Because here it is. 
[00:52:30]  Doug Weed,  the author of the new book.  Doug Weed?  Doug Weed.  Doug Weed,  the author of the new book,  The Raising of a President.  Oh boy.  Surrepetitiously.  He recorded his conversations  with Bush beginning in 19...  Surrepetitiously.  I know.  In 1998 when Bush  was governor of Texas  and considering a run  for president.  So he taped him  for nine hours  and he did it  because he gets  a nice little book deal  out of the thing.  Yeah.  Do they make Bush  look bad or good?  I mean,  do they make Bush  look like an ass  because the one quote  I read didn't make  him look bad at all. 
[00:53:00]  No, nothing I read either  makes him look bad.  It's nothing newsworthy.  It's, you know,  they're not breaking  any ground here.  We knew the guy  was a partier in college,  did some blow,  smoked some pot,  never fessed up to it  in public,  but everyone just knew.  On the tapes,  Bush discussed strategies  for stonewalling questions  about past marijuana use.  And this is Bush,  I guess,  in the tape.  Do you want your little  kid to say,  hey, daddy, 
[00:53:30]  President Bush  tried marijuana?  I think I will,  said Bush on the tapes.  That's the message  we've been sending out.  I wouldn't answer  the marijuana question.  It's kind of a lame  reason for not  fessing up to it.  Yeah.  Right.  And this is Bush also  just how he would deal  with questions  about cocaine use.  Oh.  The cocaine thing,  let me tell you  my strategy on that,  Bush said on the tape.  Rather than saying no,  I think it's time  for someone to draw the line  and look people in the eye  and say, you know,  I'm not going to participate  in ugly rumors about me  and blame my opponent  and hold the line.  Stand up for a system 
[00:54:00]  that will not allow  this kind of crap  to go on.  Wow.  He really didn't  fess up to anything there.  No.  Good one.  So this is all the guys  got on Bush  after nine hours  of taping him  as a friend, Anthony.  Yeah, pal.  I wouldn't answer  the marijuana question.  Uh-huh.  You know why?  Because I don't want  some little kid  doing what I tried.  Yeah.  And it never stops.  Of course.  But you've got to understand,  I want to be president.  I want to lead.  I want to set...  Do you want your little kid  to say, hey, daddy, 
[00:54:30]  President Bush  tried marijuana?  I think I will.  Why not?  Incidentally,  that was Frank Caliendo.  Great Bush impression.  Yeah.  Where is Frank today?  We should get Frank Caliendo  on the phone.  That doesn't make  Bush sound that bad, though.  I mean,  if that's the best you get  as a guy going,  like, this is probably  how I'd move around  in this question,  eh.  Yeah, it really isn't  a bad quote.  Well, he's a politician,  of course.  You know,  this is their job  to spin these things.  And this is, you know,  probably him caught 
[00:55:00]  at his most honest.  Mm-hmm.  You know,  because he never knew  he was being taped.  What's the big deal  if the President  of the United States  tried marijuana?  At this point,  the reality is,  just about everyone  out there of his age,  at his age,  has tried pot.  You've got to think  of the Midwest people  that are like,  God damn,  it's just as bad  as doing that LSD.  You don't think  they have tried pot, though?  Eh, they don't want  their President  smoking pot.  And some of them,  no.  I don't think...  Well, there's a difference  between smoking pot  in the White House 
[00:55:30]  and trying marijuana  when you were younger.  Yeah.  And it just makes you  look like a hypocrite  because, you know,  you're Republican  and anti-drug  and all that.  Yep.  You were doing it.  But most people  have tried marijuana  in their lifetime.  Yeah.  But it just makes you  look like a hypocrite  because the Republicans  are, you know,  the party of  zero tolerance,  really,  with drugs  and shouldn't do it,  shouldn't be legal.  And then he's saying,  you know,  yeah,  I tried it,  but if you're caught  trying it now,  I believe you should 
[00:56:00]  go to jail  and, you know,  all that happy horse shit  that they like to  pile on casual users.  And they crucified  Clinton for it.  Yeah, right, right.  Didn't inhale.  Oh, smoking pot.  Look, he's a junkie.  Crucified him.  Dude,  this is my take  on politics, man.  They all just lie.  Wow.  Pretty good, right?  That's pretty,  yeah, insightful.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'll say something  a real gem once in a while.  Is it that one you think?  Oh, what are you guys  looking for?  A little song to go to break. 
[00:56:30]  Ooh.  Want to try?  What is that?  Well, you can smoke it,  you can chew it,  you can really try to do it.  Smoking pot.  Pot, pot, pot.  Well, you can sing it in a song,  you can smoke it in a bomb.  Smoking pot.  Pot, pot, pot.  Pot.  Well, it's a lady sensation  that sweet of the nation.  Smoking pot.  Pot, pot, pot.  Let's go!  Let's go smoke some pot! 
[00:57:00]  Come on!  Let's go smoke some pot!  Well there was Ibra Kale and the new bohemian smoking pot!  Well there's the black crows and jargon crying smoking pot!  There's the spin doctors and bulls traveling smoking pot!  Let's go!  Let's go smoke some pot! 
[00:57:30]  Come on!  Let's go smoke some pot!  Let's go!  Everybody solo!  Well there's supposed to be some words here but I forgot them cause I smoked too much pot!  Pot! 
[00:58:00]  I went to Lollapalooza and everybody out there was smoking pot!  Pot!  Pot!  Well, there's supposed to be some words here, but I forgot them because I smoke too much pot.  I was at Lollapalooza and everybody out there was smoking pot.  I saw flying melon and red hot chili peppers and pearl jam and white spank, man.  Let's go smoke your pot.  Let's go smoke your pot.  Let's go smoke your pot.  Let's go smoke your pot.  Come on. 
[00:58:30]  Let's go smoke your pot.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Obi and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A.  Hey, ass cock.  Hi.  This is great. 
[00:59:00]  You dick.  Shut up, shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  Hey, don't be an Anthony show.  XM 202.  That bothers you, right? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  We're watching TV right now, and the ex-presidents.  The ex-presidents.  Bush and Clinton, presidential relief tour.  Bush senior.  Don't these guys hate each other?  They used to.  They are the best of pals now. 
[01:00:00]  You only see them hanging out together now.  They are what they call asshole buddies now.  Just, they go everywhere together.  How did this come about?  Because they hated each other.  George W. threw them together as a relief.  They do these relief tours for the tsunami.  And they're, you know, scraping up money.  You've seen the TV commercials featuring the two of them.  And now they're on tour.  They're touring the tsunami-ravaged Southeast Asia. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  President Bush senior is dyeing his hair.  You see that?  You see that?  That looks awful.  And Clinton officially looks old.  Yeah.  Since the heart thing, he officially looks old now.  But Bush senior is dyeing his hair.  What's going on in the back of his head?  It's really dark, like almost black.  Yeah, no way.  Because he's a real old guy.  No way that's his natural hair color.  Now, look.  Bush senior is holding up a map, and Clinton's also holding it. 
[01:01:00]  And they're pointing to things.  They are like the best of pals now.  My buddy.  My buddy.  Wherever I go, he goes.  Listening to the tsunami parody on the plane over.  Tree right through her head.  That's funny stuff.  Look at the big hog in Clinton's pants, too.  Yeah, that's something going on in the front of his pants.  Wow.  All the young girls over there.  Or boys, whatever you could pick from over there. 
[01:01:30]  So we're all looking at the TV during the commercial, and Jimmy's like,  can you imagine getting a picture with Bush and Clinton?  Yeah.  And I look at Jimmy and go, well, I got my picture taken with Clinton.  And all of a sudden, Jimmy just goes, ugh.  That's right.  Just all mad.  And then Ben goes, well, I got a picture of Clinton, too.  And he's like, ugh.  Actually, Ben's was in a picture.  Him and Clinton were having a large hog contest, and they just stood side by side.  Ben's picture is the worst, though.  It is so blurry. 
[01:02:00]  It is not.  It is.  You haven't even seen it, number one.  Bring in your...  He was probably moving when it was taken.  Ben was just jerking.  Yeah, bring in your picture of you and Clinton.  Clinton's looking better than he has, though.  He's right when he got his office.  He's got some color and stuff.  Yeah, he doesn't like that.  Mmm.  All right.  I know you like your apple.  Relax.  I got to thank the guy from Revelays in Tom's River.  This is a porcelain apple.  It could be the crispiest or the yummiest.  Oh, I bite into it.  I have to put my hand down because the juices are leaking out. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  Yet it's crispy.  A lovely apple.  Oh, I thought you were talking about the wipe swapper.  Oh, yeah.  He loves when juices run out, doesn't he?  I sure do.  Yeah, Ben has the worst picture of him and Clinton, by the way.  Where did Ben get that one?  Ben was just a young go-getter.  A young buck.  I don't know, man.  I mean, he looks like a junior senator or something.  Really?  Whatever they're called.  What are they called when you're in college and you're thinking about going into politics? 
[01:03:00]  Sodomized.  His hair is all short.  He's a lot thinner.  Clinton?  No.  Oh, Ben?  It's in Boston.  I got it in Boston.  Oh, it's in Boston?  I'm so excited.  But you know your picture's blurry.  It was when I was by the Park Plaza.  I was in a small holding area where there was only like 30 people that he was definitely  going to come by.  Yeah, but this is when he was president, so the security.  Oh.  But there's a thing about Clinton.  Oh.  And your picture's better because he was president when you got yours? 
[01:03:30]  He was president.  You know something?  I might have to give Ben that.  The quality of the picture, I haven't seen Ben's.  If it's blurry, that's one thing.  But getting a standing president's picture, a sitting president's picture, wow, that's  pretty big.  Yeah, but it's so blurry.  It is not blurry.  And I got it signed by him, too.  It's autographed to me.  And Clinton doesn't even, he's not even looking at the camera because he doesn't even know  anyone's taking his picture.  They're a lot more accessible after office, though.  It was like someone, whoever was taking the picture for you was in panic mode, like, 
[01:04:00]  oh my God, I got to get this shot.  His hands were shaking or something because it's a, it's not, it's not even cropped.  It's not even centered.  It's just like, you know, the bottom right hand, you know, part of the picture is Ben and  Clinton.  You really studied that.  Oh, yeah, I did.  He's seen it like once.  Look at him comment.  Dude, bring it in.  Bring it in.  I got to see it, yeah.  Yeah, you got to bring it in.  Two of you are making me sick fighting over your Clinton pictures.  I wish I had one.  I think either one of them.  Yeah, I don't have one either.  The coolest presidential thing I ever got. 
[01:04:30]  Mine's great because my arms around him, we're both smiling.  Yeah, but Ben Wilson, his is better because Clinton had a tie on.  You think yours is better because his shirt was open?  The two of you make me nauseous.  He does, he actually, yeah, it was just when he got in office, too.  He'd only been in office a couple months, really young and just, yeah, with tie and  everything and there's Secret Service all around him.  Not like yours, it's just out behind some bookstore in Long Island, you know.  Mine's great.  I love my picture.  I had sent a Christmas card to Richard Nixon when I was a kid, yeah, and I actually got 
[01:05:00]  one back from, yeah, and it wasn't a form one either.  It was actually signed.  Did you still have it?  No.  What did you do with it?  I probably, like, didn't even make it through the year.  I was, I don't even remember how old I was.  I was a little kid.  And then, you know, I didn't think it would be worth anything.  What do I know?  I know a Richard Nixon signed Christmas card.  What an ass.  This apple wasn't so good, I'd throw it at you.  How do you lose that?  I know.  How did you lose it? 
[01:05:30]  You're a kid.  It's like, oh, look, Richard Nixon sent me a Christmas card.  Boom.  You can throw it away with the, you know, grandmas.  Yeah.  It's pretty stupid.  All right, though.  And my shingles are clearing up.  My shingle.  Anthony.  You're not a Jew boy, are you?  A little sing-along that's going to lead to something.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

As you know, if you're a faithful listener of this program, that's taken on a life of its own, the whole banana phone thing, right?  Entrenched in my head now for the rest of the day.  Well, now we got the acoustic Indian version of the banana phone.  Acoustic Indian version? 
[01:07:00]  You may have heard the heavy metal version that we played.  Yes, yes.  There's a couple other versions we've played, but this one came in today.  Listen to this.  What type of Indian?  Is it dot head or woo-woo?  Oh, no, dot head.  Oh, dot head Indian.  I knew this was going to happen because it's snowing in New York.  It's time to look at the gates in Central Park.  Oh, with the snow on the ground.  Now, that's what we wanted.  That's what Christo wanted.  That's beautiful.  The stark difference between just the white snow, the dark trees, and the beautiful saffron gates. 
[01:07:30]  And the black reporter and the white snow.  And she's way up in Harlem.  Wow.  She's as far north in the park as you could get, by the way, in case you're following along at home.  Look at that.  That was beautiful.  You knew they had to do that, right, Anthony?  Yes.  What a crock of shit.  Now, you know, now the gates make sense in the snow.  Now I can see it's art.  Yeah.  Sure.  I can see it.

You know, where you could let one go and you think you could get away with it? 
[01:10:30]  I think you mean, did he have a little log in there and maybe a little gas squeezed by?  Ah.  I said, excuse me.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Eric, just how you're reacting, I know you did it.  Yeah.  So admit it.  No, I did it.  You're not acting.  You're not a good actor.  You see his acting?  You're not a good actor.  Whatever.  You're in the face that you're smelling something.  Because usually it's him and you say, did somebody smell something?  I'm going around like I don't smell anything.  Your overacting is awful.  Yeah, it was very much overacting.  Because let me tell you something, the smell is now gone. 
[01:11:00]  And so I asked if you possibly leaked when you walked around here.  No, I didn't.  So then you come over here like it's still here going, oh my God.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, it was overacting a little much.  And it's not around anymore.  You were really overacting.  Eric actually put a hand on each hip and leaned forward and went, ah, I smell it.  Good point.  Mr. Faber-Sham, I did not fart in this studio.  Not fart in this studio.  Rachel, you farted.  And it didn't smell like Jimmy's.  At this point we all know what Jimmy's smell like. 
[01:11:30]  Mine have their own patented fine odor.  Yeah, there's no mistake in yours.  No, rank.  No.  I'm going to bottle one and sell it on eBay.  A nice gasser to enjoy at a party.  Maybe open in front of your girlfriend under her nose while she's sleeping.  That's not a bad idea actually.  It's fun for everyone.  It's not a bad idea.  I don't think they last in a jar.  I don't know.  If they did, it would be hilarious to order a fart online and someone could open the jar  take a deep breath. 
[01:12:00]  Celebrity farts online.  When we'd be in the car with Florentine, he would fart.  I swear to God, if me, him, and Lee were in the cup, I would fart into a cup and hand  it to him and he would smell it and go, not bad.  How did all of you fit in a cup?  What?  You said we were in the cup.  Didn't I say we were in the car?  No, you said you were all in the cup.  I knew you were going, but I had to call you honest.  I really am a zilch.  All in a cup.  In the little teacups at Disney.  Spinning around.  I actually met an athletic supporter. 
[01:12:30]  Three of us were just hanging out inside of Ben's athletic supporter.  Using this as a toboggan.  Well, you could.  Martini Steve in the studio.  Hey, man.  Wearing a flaming wool hat on this chilly, snowy morning.  This is a great hat.  A listener sent me a whole box of flame stuff.  Flame hat, flame satchel, flame wallet.  Nice.  Oh, it was great.  For your birthday?  Yeah.  When's your birthday?  Tomorrow.  Oh, happy birthday.  Thank you.  How old are you? 
[01:13:00]  31.  Wow.  People say, how old are you?  I always go, 29 again.  And he gets laughing.  Every time.  Again, that's the funny part.  Yeah, because they know.  I'm kidding.  I know it's on Found Your Music.  You got a whole birthday.  He started it.  Eric started it.  I had no idea.  A birthday wish list.  I got...  And I didn't even set that up.  This is the stuff that's...  Are you kidding?  This is what Steve wants for his birthday.  I didn't set it up though.  I don't know where it came from.  He wants our listeners to send him birthday gifts.  I got up in the morning and checked my email.  There's like 50 emails and I had no idea where they were coming from.  He set up a thing, a whole wish list for me. 
[01:13:30]  Eric set up a whole...  I didn't do that.  But you had to throw it up on your website.  I didn't throw it up.  That's the point.  I didn't do it.  What do you want Steve?  What's on the wish list?  I don't know.  Eric is going to have to tell me.  I think there's a plasma screen TV there on there.  Of course.  Flame hats and audio of tortured children.  If you have any of that, please email us.  As we get that website up there, we've been playing this audio all morning.  You've got to tell me what this is from.  Oh, that's the...  Let it finish.  Sorry.  Oh! 
[01:14:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  What is that from?  That is from a video clip somebody sent in of...  It's obviously done in a motel room.  It's two people on a bed.  The guy's dogging this girl from behind. 
[01:14:30]  And it's a video that looks like it's placed on a tripod on a nightstand in the hotel room.  It's just one stationary shot.  Nice.  But it's looking down.  And she's just getting drilled and screaming.  And he's pulling her hair from behind.  Yeah, it's great.  And the video's up on Foundry Music?  No.  No.  No?  No.  I can put the audio up.  Yeah.  But there's just certain stuff we gotta watch out.  The hardcore stuff I gotta lay off.  Steve's wish list.  The first item on it is $7,000. 
[01:15:00]  That is...  You keep wishing there.  Wow.  What is it?  A plasma TV?  Yes.  I don't know.  Fujitsu PDS 4209, 42-inch plasma flat panel television.  That's fantastic.  I didn't set this up, but that is great.  $7,000 for 42-inch plasma?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  Yeah, it is.  Actually, consider you can get one.  $50,000 is nothing for open.  Yeah, that's open.  Why wouldn't $7,000 be?  He's a big star and stuff.  Yeah, we can get seven of those.  Yeah.  Please.  Good math. 
[01:15:30]  Uh...  Oh, you know what this is?  This is, um...  About two years ago, I asked all the writers on that website to set up wish lists for themselves,  and we put it on one big one, and I think this is a combination of what, like, nine people  asked for.  Yeah, there's a lot of video games up here.  Yeah, honestly, I haven't played a video game in months.  Yeah, like Splinter Cell.  Yeah.  That's an old game now.  It's a very good game, though.  No one coming out.  Watch, it's all gonna be video games.  I'm gonna have to give them to other people.  A lot of Frank Zappa.  Yeah, I didn't put that.  See what the cheapest one is.  Nothing I want.  There's nothing I want. 
[01:16:00]  The widescreen version of Minority Report for twelve bucks.  Great.  Alright, I'll get you that.  Okay.  Someone...  Someone blasted one.  Holy crap.  Come on.  Jim.  Jimmy!  Son of a...  See, that's the difference, dude.  That's the difference right there.  That's horrible.  These go right through you.  Oh, my God.  I was cutting promos with Jim on Friday.  He farted right in my face.  Oh, my God.  By the way, that was... 
[01:16:30]  Because I went to Starbucks yesterday.  And I had half and half.  It's disgusting.  And milk doesn't sit very well in my belly.  It smells like sour milk.  Oh, God.  And incidentally, the first one was mine, too.  That you blamed Eric for.  Oh, you stumped man.  That you blamed Eric for.  Of course we did.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We were ready to lynch him.  I know.  He was standing there chuckling.  I know.  Just so happy somebody else got...  Oh, stop.  Did you see me trying to...  Did you see me trying to blame this one on him, too?  I'm just looking at him like...  Dude.  Oh, my God. 
[01:17:00]  Holy Jesus.  That's horrid.  No, don't keep opening the door because you're blowing it more this way.  Yeah, you're just blowing it right toward us, you idiot.  Oh, God.  Wow, is that bad.  Wow, is that bad.  I just got nervous.  I'm sorry.  It happened.  Shut up.  My apple was so good, it just frightened me.  A little bit snuck out.  Let's go to Giant.  John from New York.  What's up, John?  Good morning, guys.  Morning.  Good morning there, sweet kids.  Hi, Guy.  Not you.  Oh.  I had a little thing that happened to me. 
[01:17:30]  We went shopping with my wife.  I said, listen, we've got to finish this up.  I've got to go to the bathroom.  So we get home in the basement, right, and I usually put out the silenced ones.  So we get to the basement, park the car, I put out a silenced one, but it didn't feel  right.  And as I started to walk up the stairs, I felt a little lubrication, you know.  It was pretty easy walking up the stairs.  Uh-huh.  It formed a seal.  I'm a big, I'm a heavy guy.  It formed a seal between my thighs and my ass cheeks. 
[01:18:00]  And when I got to the bathroom, that stuff was all over me.  You know, like my balls were covered in the front of the bunt, and ugh.  It was brutal.  It looked like you sat on an axle.  So I shared that with you this morning.  Thank you.  Nice.  You're the best of us, right?  You're thinking you're letting one go and...  Oh.  Pokes out?  Nah.  I...  Let me really give this some thought, because I don't think I've ever done that. 
[01:18:30]  Of course not, Anthony.  You're perfect.  No, I'm really...  I would be completely honest with you.  When it comes to bodily functions, you're perfect.  I try to be, and always have tried to be perfect.  You never had a little nugget roll down your leg and fall on the doorstep?  No.  That's my best story ever.  I can't recall.  Best story ever, man.  I had some kind of weird...  Yeah.  What is that lobster they sell in...  Eric might know, in Florida.  It's not like lobster you get up here.  It's like a little different. 
[01:19:00]  And it was with a cream sauce and stuff, and it just got my stomach going.  Ooh.  And I was down in Florida.  This goes back a few years with my girlfriend at the time.  And actually, Ricky was living down there.  Yeah.  And his new girlfriend at the time.  And so it's the big visit.  You know, we're going to go see my brother and his new girlfriend.  And, you know, we have a nice little, I guess it was a night or weekend together.  Was it Lobster Newberg?  Something. 
[01:19:30]  It's just a...  One of those creamy ones.  Yeah, but it's a different type of lobster.  So, we're on the front stoop, and my stomach was just awful for like 24 hours.  And I'm thinking I can let a little fart go, because I'm just dying.  Like, I'm just aching, you know.  Oh my God, let me just let this little gas out.  And I let the gas out, but it wasn't a fart.  And a little nugget, I was wearing shorts and boxers at the time.  A little nugget pops out of my bunghole and just drops down right in front of the mat in front of everybody. 
[01:20:00]  I'm completely disgusting.  It was probably the most embarrassing thing ever to happen to me, ever.  That would be pretty embarrassing.  Just imagine, you're standing there, you're this cool, you know...  Who was everybody, though?  It was me, Sandy at the time.  Oh my God.  Ricky and Linda.  But I didn't know Ricky that well, and I didn't know Linda, certainly.  Wow.  That was way back, and I'm on the stoop, saying goodbye, letting this little gas thing go as they're chit-chatting, like I'm off on the side a little bit. 
[01:20:30]  And sure enough, I felt something pop out, and it just rolls down my leg and just presents itself right on the doormat.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  Did you do it again?  No, you farted again.  No, I didn't.  No more farting in here.  I didn't fart here.  Oh, that's going to help, Anthony.  Yeah, that'll take care of that.  I told him firmly that time.  Put your nose in it and hit you with a newspaper, you animal. 
[01:21:00]  And then ask me why I have a rod.  Yeah, but a little nugget popped out.  Welcome, Matt.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike in Westchester.  Mike, what's up?  How you doing?  Question for Norton.  It's hard to hear you guys, I'm sorry.  I've been told by my wife that I need to improve my sex life, and I wanted to ask him about the three different drugs out there. 
[01:21:30]  Viagra, Levitra, Dialis, see the differences between them all.  All right, what's the problem, though?  Well, just normal stuff.  You know, she's just looking to get banged a lot harder, I guess, and I'm not doing it for her right now.  How many times are you doing it a week?  Not too many anymore.  We're doing it maybe once or twice every couple of months.  Yeesh.  And she wants you to get more rods or she's leaving?  Yeah, that's basically what she's telling me.  How's no pressure? 
[01:22:00]  How fat did she get?  I'm not too fat.  I'm maybe 190 or 5'9".  Not you.  Oh, her.  Not you.  No, she's not too bad.  I mean, she's had some kids, so she's, you know, she's got a little bit of weight to her, but she's not oversized.  So you're not really turned on by her anymore?  I don't know what it is.  You know, I guess it's between the two of us, you know, trying to get it, trying to get sparked up there.  Oh, it's over. 
[01:22:30]  Well, what seems to be the problem on your end?  Well, that's how it goes.  I'm thinking, like you said, I'm thinking just, you know, a longer ride or going longer would, you know, maybe would take care of that stuff for her.  Yeah, but I mean, do you want to have sex with her?  Oh, definitely.  But you're just not getting the rods anymore?  Well, I'm not being able to keep it up for a longer time.  You know, not being able to go for, you know, an extended period of time. 
[01:23:00]  Well, dude, are you losing your rods or are you just finishing quick?  Well, Paul, well, normally, yeah, you finish quick and then I'm, you know, and then that's it for the night.  Well, that's fine.  What's the problem?  Tell her to hurry up.  You're doing your job.  She's taking too long.  Yeah, basically.  So I'm trying to figure out, I was thinking about getting with one of those, but I know you were, you had some pros and cons about each one of them.  So I was trying to figure out which one would be the best one.  Well, I've tried all three.  You don't want to do them too much. 
[01:23:30]  In Rio, I was doing Viagra.  Viagra gives you a great rod.  It's really hard to finish though.  It really makes you very congested.  That's probably the one he wants then.  Well, they all give you, I think Cialis is the best.  Because it lasts for a couple of days.  Although, when we were in, Keith Robinson got a really brutal headache in Rio from Cialis.  Levitro works well.  Was he listening to himself?  That'll do it.  So all three of them work, dude. 
[01:24:00]  But my recommendation would be Cialis, I guess.  But I guess they're all good.  Yeah.  Yeah, but there, it seems like something else is going on there.  Yeah, I agree with Hope.  Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that out.  Yeah.  Dip it in some.  All right, guys.  All right, thanks buddy.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Throw some coke on it.  I got the audio of Norton farting.  I guess he was supposed to be doing some VOs, as they say in the business, Anthony.  VOs.  Yeah, Jimmy was cutting some promos for a couple of upcoming gigs on Friday after the show. 
[01:24:30]  And he's so cold and calculating when he does this because he's, you know, when he's cutting,  when anybody's cutting voice sessions in there, you're standing literally at, with your ass  at my face level and you're talking into a microphone and you're maybe six inches away  from each other.  So, you know, he's pretty cold to let one rip right in my face as he's doing this.  And he's completely straight until he knows that I've smelled it because you just hear  this break and he starts to cackle like a madman.  It really disgusted him. 
[01:25:00]  Go, sweetie.  Go, sweetie.  Hi, Boston.  It's Jim Norton.  And I'll be coming up for the first time in quite a while.  April 8th and 9th, I'll be performing at the Comedy Connection.  April 8th and 9th, Comedy Connection.  Box office is 617-248-9700.  617-248-9700. That's 617-248-9700. 
[01:25:30]  That's disgusting.  Sit in there, just keep reading them. I don't want to...  Yeah, Pat, help me do my Borgata Casino in the Atlantic City.  You guys, the Atlantic City Borgata Casino, April 16th.  Tickets go on sale February 26th at 10 a.m. at Ticketmaster.com.  All right.  Little Jim Norton will be in Atlantic City at the Borgata Casino, April 16th. 
[01:26:00]  Tickets go on sale February 26th at 10 a.m.  Call Ticketmaster.com.  Dot com.  And he has one for Boston, too.  Ah.  No, that's Houston.  Oh, Boston.  Little Jimmy Norton's going to be in Boston at the Comedy Connection, April 8th and 9th.  Boxed office is 617-248-9700.  The Comedy Connection.  Cool. Thanks.  All right. 
[01:26:30]  No problem.  Sticks more of the farter.  Come, Steve. Tell Steve it's gone.  Steve, it smells like a...  And he just farted again.  Yeah, he dropped another one.  Steve's getting... coming back in.  Here comes Steve.  It's not gone, man.  It's just crap.  Jesus.  Oh, just...  I dropped another hot one and I snuck out real quick to trap it in that air-type vacuum room. 
[01:27:00]  You know what you do?  You fart and then you laugh like a supervillain who's just used, like, his power against humanity.  Well, I was quiet.  I was like, hey, I'm coming at you.  And then I read the date and I know it's going to smash him in a couple of seconds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So his voice just starts to crack a little bit.  And he knows it's creeping up my nostrils.  And it's just...  You're a second away from vomiting.  Well, did you hear that nervous idiot Pat when he said, could you read a promo?  Well, his breath actually skipped. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, Jimmy Norton.  Atlantic City left off the A.  What a dope.  Atlantic City for a little.  Just put an apostrophe where the A went.  Jim in Virginia.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, fellas.  What's going on?  I'm kind of screwing off today.  What's up with you?  Hey, listen.  We were talking about awful shits that come on all of a sudden.  I was on my way to work one morning.  And, you know, just cramping up like crazy.  Didn't think I was going to make it in a half hour drive. 
[01:28:00]  And I got out of the parking lot.  Soon as I hit the fucking pavement, I let one rip.  It went down my leg into my sock and my shoes.  Didn't even get into work yet.  I had to go home and change.  Punch it out.  Too late.  You just spun in.  Steve, before you leave, we were talking about like hot sex scenes from movies.  Yeah.  And we were talking about Swimming Pool.  Swimming Pool. 
[01:28:30]  Somebody on Instant Feedback was just thanking us for bringing up that movie.  He said he watched it.  And Chick was so hot.  Movie so hot.  Loved it.  We're still trying to get audio on the air.  Yeah, I know.  On the sex scenes from that movie.  I thought I had it.  I don't.  Now I have to go get it.  Is it on your wish list?  No.  Actually, it's not.  And then we were talking about that movie where, what, the chick says that?  Oh, yeah.  They thought it was Othello, but it's really storytellers.  Storytellers.  And it's Selma Blair and some black guy. 
[01:29:00]  Black guy?  Yeah, some black guy.  The college professor.  Yeah, the college professor in the thing.  It's an independent film that came out in 2001, I believe.  But a bunch of listeners are saying that this is a really hot sex scene.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  All right.  And you got the audio of it today.  You can't rent it and see it, though.  You can't rent this movie?  Like, we tried renting it at Blockbuster.  They put a big red block across the screen because it's beyond R.  So they put these big red blocks in front of everything.  So you can hear the audio, but you can't see the scene. 
[01:29:30]  Isn't that amazing with Blockbuster?  Wait, what?  Yeah, we tried renting it a while ago.  If you rent it from Blockbuster, they block out the scene.  You can hear the audio, but you see nothing.  See, this is the big problem in America.  Screw Blockbuster.  What are you doing?  Netflix?  Yeah, Netflix.  You get it from Netflix.  They won't block it out.  Good.  Netflix is putting Blockbuster under.  Exactly.  And Blockbuster is now being sued because to answer Netflix, they had to do something where  they said, we're eliminating all late fees.  That's what Blockbuster said. 
[01:30:00]  You read into it, they're not.  You still have to, a week later, if you don't bring your movie in, you have to pay a restocking  fee, which is a late fee.  And then if you keep it for another week or so, they make you buy the movie.  So then you're paying the price that you would if you went down to the store and bought the  movie.  That's what just amazes me, that Blockbuster is editing these films because they feel it's  inappropriate for their customers.  Good luck.  Good luck, Blockbuster, because Blockbuster is waiting to be a dinosaur. 
[01:30:30]  They are just waiting.  There's so many ways to get movies that they're just...  So you rent this movie and what happens?  You hear the audio, but the screen goes red?  It's a scene in a hotel room.  Right as they're about to start something, all of a sudden, boom, red blocks the screen.  You hear the audio, but you don't see it.  They do it to keep the movie as an R rating.  As an R rating, why is it their problem, what movies they're renting?  Well, the movie, Blockbuster probably doesn't do it.  I'm guessing that they give people, and I think they're awful. 
[01:31:00]  They probably give an option.  They go, look, this is what makes it an R rating.  If you want us to carry it, like Walmart will do that with certain labels and certain  CD covers.  This is what you have to do to get...  Blockbuster doesn't actually censor it.  But here's the problem.  It's sickening, though.  Here's the problem.  Blockbuster doesn't have movies like that.  They won't rent them.  The X-rated movies.  They will soon.  But they move into a town, and this small video store that did carry that crap goes  broke.  They have to leave, and now anybody in that area can't get any type of entertainment. 
[01:31:30]  The one move Blockbuster hasn't done yet, but I've heard that they're contemplating it,  is doing the adult section.  And because they're losing so much revenue to Netflix, they're getting closer and closer  to making that decision.  There are guys that I've spoken to out on the West Coast that call up the Blockbuster buyers  every week just to check in because they know they're close to making that because they're  losing so much money.  Good.  Because Netflix is going broke.  Yeah, exactly.  Netflix is...  And they've started a business like Netflix.  Is Netflix really doing that well?  Taking off...  Taking off Netflix. 
[01:32:00]  Look at their stock.  It's phenomenal.  They're taking off because you can get what you want.  No late fees.  You keep the movie as long as you like.  It's easy.  You know, you get it.  It's not one of those you drive down there and get it like that day, but the next day,  right?  Yeah.  You got the movie.  You just go online.  They've got thousands of movies.  You just add it into your database, and then they send it out to you, and the envelope's  prepaid.  When you're done, you slide it back in, drop it in the mailbox.  Two days later, you get the next movies on your list.  Yeah, now Blockbuster started a similar service, where you can go online and get it the same 
[01:32:30]  way, but, you know, good.  I hope Blockbuster goes broke.  So do I.  That's who you get.  Keep thinking for other people.  Yeah.  Wait, now, Dave has a little more info on this.  Dave in Chicago.  Go ahead, Dave.  Hey, hi, opening up.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, buddy.  That storytelling movie, the director act, you put that on, that block, theatrically, because  the MPAA wouldn't let it air it, so he was like his fuck you to the MPAA to put  that on there, that pink box. 
[01:33:00]  Wait, so you can never, ever see the scene?  Not theatrically, but there's two DVD releases.  I bet Blockbuster just carried the one that didn't have it.  Right, so why don't they carry the other one?  Right.  But you should watch that movie, too.  It's got another disturbing plot line with this pedophile that Jimmy might like.  I don't know.  Jimmy doesn't like that pedophile crap.  This one says, Eric's full of shit.  The storytelling DVD has both unrated edition and the R-rated orange blocked version on the  same disc. 
[01:33:30]  Not when you rent it.  Not when you rent it from Blockbuster.  Yeah, but I didn't think Blockbuster would actually go in and censor it, but that's just  the...  No, they don't censor it.  Like, a lot of people think Blockbuster goes there and sits in their editing room, their  Blockbuster editing room, and censor it.  No, they take...  They'll only distribute the censored versions of a lot of these things.  No, NC-17, right?  Only rated R for family.  Yeah.  I've gone in there and looked for movies, and then I ask at the counter, hey, you got  this or the...  And they go, no, we don't carry that.  Yuck.  What?  Yuck.  We'll have 500 copies of Rush Hour, douchebags.  Let's go to Rob in California. 
[01:34:00]  Hey, Rob.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, Blockbuster will never have adult movies.  They're owned by the Mormon Church.  What?  They're owned by Viacom.  They're owned by Viacom.  They're owned by our old bosses, yeah.  Wayne Heisinger used to own them, the same guy that used to own the Dolphins, and I guess  he sold them to Viacom.  All right.  Thanks, Rob.  Well, maybe the church doesn't have an interest in it, or maybe the church did at one time  have them and put that stipulation.  That was a different story.  But maybe they put the stipulation in that whoever buys it can't use it for adult films.  The thing with the Mormon Church was there was a company out in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
[01:34:30]  that would take movies like The Matrix and remove all the violence from it, like the  bullets when he'd lean back.  Yeah.  It was just white flashes of light, and they would add different sound effects and edit scenes  so there was no violence, there was no cursing.  So family-friendly versions of these R and NC-17 movies could be made to the public, and  they got sued by every movie company in Hollywood.  Good.  That's what they should.  Well, we have the audio of the scene from storytelling.  It's very, very hot.  It's very hot and steamy. 
[01:35:00]  Check it out as we go to break.  It's really a nice place you have.  It's around high.  Take off your top.  Now.  Take off the rest.  Turn around.  Bend over.  Bend over.  Bend over. 
[01:35:30]  Bend over.  End lows.  End lows.  Nigger.  I...  I can't do that. 
[01:36:00]  Say...  Nigger.  Yeah.  God.  Say, nigger...  Nigger.  Fuck me hard.  Fuck.  ...me...  ...heart.  Say, nigger.  Fuck-me-heart.  Nigger.  Nigger, fuck me hard.  Again.  Nigger, fuck me hard. 
[01:36:30]  Again.  Nigger, fuck me hard.  Again.  Nigger, fuck me hard.  Again.  Nigger, fuck me hard.  Again.  Nigger, fuck me hard.  Again.  Nigger, fuck me hard.  Yeah.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all appointments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness. 
[01:37:00]  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Fix it, fix it.  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice cake, geek.  Back.  Bag it.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid. 
[01:37:30]  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What the fuck?  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  Yeah.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little hope in the night. 
[01:38:00]  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little hope in the night.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Okay, caught.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Back to the phones. 
[01:38:30]  Let's talk to George in Colorado.  George, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  Pretty good, George.  Hey, I've got a couple of things for you.  Yeah.  The swimming pool.  You know there are three versions of that movie. 
[01:39:00]  Oh?  There is the version that they've been playing on HBO.  Yeah.  There is the unrated version, which Blockbuster is hearing.  And then there is an X-rated version.  But I have only seen a reference to the X-rated version on the Internet.  And I have seen the unrated, and I've seen the R-rated.  And while that young girl, that young chick is hot, the sex scenes are not that great.  They really, I mean, I've seen better sex scenes.  The one in the bedroom was pretty good. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, the old lady?  No.  No, not the old lady.  Yeah, the older chick in there.  I mean, she didn't do anything.  But, hey, you guys are talking about Netflix.  Yeah.  There is an adult film version of Netflix.  Yeah.  And they're based here in Colorado.  The website is www.netxflix.com.  And that's all they can.  They just started in October, so they're slowly building their film base. 
[01:40:00]  But do they...  Thank you, George.  How do they guarantee they're renting to an adult?  Yeah, really?  You probably got to do the old credit card.  Oh, probably.  That old scam.  But you could get in trouble if the person's young.  Am I right or wrong, guys?  Right?  That's my new regular guy thing.  Jeremy from Jersey says, 
[01:40:30]  That clip, maybe you should add one of those,  you might want to turn your radio down warnings.  Shoo, that was close, he says.  Yeah, that was some clip.  Yeah, well, I didn't want to give it away there.  Wow.  We like surprising you.  That was surprising.  Hey, guys, come around my radio.  They're playing something really hot.  And you got a brother that's working with you.  Oops.  What do you mean?  You missed the audio clip.  It was really hot.  Oh, yeah.  Spencer, what's up? 
[01:41:00]  Hey, even more proof that Blockbuster sucks.  After you guys had the guys from Chappelle on,  I went out to get the Chappelle DVDs to rent,  and they don't carry them there.  No, huh?  Why?  It's really ridiculous.  There couldn't be any reason for that, though,  because Chappelle's stuff is on TV.  I guarantee you that maybe they're not renting them yet.  There's no reason they wouldn't carry them.  Yeah.  Unless Chappelle, unless Comedy Central wants to recoup some of their money  and have people buy them only for a while.  All right.  Because the bottom line is it's all about the almighty dollar. 
[01:41:30]  Am I right or wrong?  That's right.  You're right.  The little guy always loses.  Dave on Long Island.  What's up, Dave?  Yeah, how you doing?  I didn't think this was worth getting on the air for,  but I was just wondering the poker thing that Anthony's going to be on.  Whose money do they start with?  Yeah.  How did we, uh...  Mmm.  See the...  Whose money are you playing?  Well, oh, it seems that the hotshot celebrities, of which I am one,  we get a free seat.  Ooh. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Get the old free seat.  This is an invitational.  I heard it was like a $25,000 buy-in.  That's what everyone's going to start off at.  Wow.  But you didn't have to do that?  No, no, no, no, no.  Some of the other people that are there,  they might have had to pay, but not me.  No.  Thank God.  Playing with 25 Gs?  I'd, uh...  I'd freak.  No, you wouldn't.  I'm going to be freaking as it is.  No, you won't.  Oh, come on.  You're going to have a good time.  We leave for L.A. tomorrow after the show.  Right after the show, we head to the airport. 
[01:42:30]  I was thinking, if I got to sit, like they were saying,  if I'm at a table with Doyle Brunson,  there's no way I'm getting through the first table.  Who's Doyle?  He's...  Please.  He's, like...  Is he the one...  One of the guys.  He's been playing forever.  He's one of the older gentlemen.  Is he the one with the mirror sunglasses?  No, no.  He's the old guy.  You'll kill him.  Like, you always see him at the poker things.  He's very old.  He's been doing this his whole life,  and he's really good.  He wrote a best-selling book on poker, 
[01:43:00]  and if he's at the table, there's no way.  It would be like...  I swear to you.  It would be like...  And this is not even an exaggeration.  Take my softball team, not even yours,  my softball team that I played against you at the Newark Stadium.  Your team stunk.  I know.  Take them.  We play the Yankees.  How much of a chance would I have of winning?  But it's poker.  It's all about luck.  No. 
[01:43:30]  It's not about luck.  Sure it is.  It really isn't.  You think it is.  And it should be.  But it is not about luck.  It's about luck.  There is an element of luck.  There's no strategy in cards.  There's an element of luck there.  There's no strategy.  It's all about the betting.  It is all about how you bet, when you bet, who you're betting to, your position.  It really...  The cards...  Are you allowed to take Valium or something before you play poker so no one can figure out  your little ticks and stuff? 
[01:44:00]  Your poker face?  No.  Actually, you can do whatever the hell you want.  They drink.  A lot of these guys are pounding drinks down as they're playing, which I might have to resort  to after I'm there with one chip left.  You know, I've watched the poker on TV.  I still don't get it.  Because now I'm looking at these guys and they look like they have a really good poker face.  So how are these other guys going, oh, wait a minute.  I can tell that he has nothing in this hand and he's bluffing.  They can not only tell by looking at him, but they can tell by what they're betting, when  they're betting it.  You know?  They can tell if they're trying to suck him in, slow play him a little bit. 
[01:44:30]  They got something good, but you don't want to let him know you got something good.  So you slide something small in there.  And then all of a sudden you call the bet and then he hits you with something big.  Then you're kind of thinking, eh, you know, I've kind of been sucked into a trap.  Do you fold and take the loss or do you keep going and hope he's bluffing?  There's so much to it and it's not just the cards and the luck, which is, you know, why  if somebody like him is sitting there or, you know, the other guy, Daniel Negrano, if 
[01:45:00]  he's sitting there, I'm done.  I'm done.  I figured it out, by the way, how you can bluff them.  Whenever you get your first two cards, no matter what they are, just go, yes, aces!  That's a good, good a strategy as any.  Yes, aces!  Well, you're going to be blown out after the first day.  I would assume, yeah.  Are you even doing the show Wednesday?  Um, I think I get 15-minute break every 90 minutes. 
[01:45:30]  So, do the math.  When are we broadcasting?  We're broadcasting from L.A. Wednesday and Thursday.  I know that.  And what time?  12 to 4.  12 to 4.  12 to 4.  I think I started 2.  12 to 4, what?  L.A. time?  L.A. time.  All right.  How far, by the way, from Anthony's game?  So, that's 3 to 70's, Coach.  You guys are going to be pretty close.  Can I wait?  So, I'm going to be able to probably get up during some of the breaks.  When does the game start?  I believe two.  So, I'll have a couple hours with you guys.  And then the last two hours, you'll be playing.  The last two hours, I'll be playing.  And Jimmy and I will be kind of just commenting about the silliness that is this whole thing.  And trying to organize a show. 
[01:46:00]  Praying for guests.  Pray for guests.  You should have.  I have a lot of guests.  That should come through for us.  But, yeah, I don't think we're going to have to worry about making any kind of contingency plans for me not being there the second day.  Because these guys, they're going to rip me apart.  Like I said earlier, I'm just hoping to go in there, have a good time.  If I could take one or two pots away from these big guys, that's, you know, that's the dream come true.  Isn't David Schwimmer at your table, too? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, I've got to be David Schwimmer.  I've got to be David Schwimmer.  I'm just going to sit there, wait for the good cards, not be too aggressive at the beginning.  And hopefully, they'll eliminate some of the people while I just kind of hang back.  When you're sitting next to David Schwimmer, ask him about Brad and Jen.  Yeah, yeah, I'll get the scoop.  Get the scoop.  Like he's going to know.  Get the scoop.  I don't know.  And can you drop in that your friend wants a picture with him?  Like just while you guys are playing?  Please.  Yeah, I'm going to have to do a show with him. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, he's going to be kind of been late.  He's going to want to be taking pictures with these guys.  Taking pictures.  Ah!  What was that?  Freddy Krueger.  Freddy Krueger.  What's her name?  Melissa Esridge.  Every time her bald head pops up on TV, it's just scary.  She really should be sitting on some trainer's forearm and then flying away while he wears a glove.  Long way to go for an eagle reference.  I know.  Wow.  That should be cancer.  Good for her.  Very good.  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Let's say hi to Tony in Jersey.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, fellas, what's up?  How are you?  Ed.  Hey.  Last week you were talking about when you wake up in the middle of the night, you know,  you've got to stay in that zone and just fall back asleep.  Don't start getting preoccupied.  Right.  Don't look over at the computer and play a few hands.  Yeah.  Well, I've never, ever even thought about when I wake up in the middle of the night playing,  but because you said that, I got on last night, and it was about five in the morning.  Well, I guess it was only a couple hours ago. 
[01:48:00]  We were already sitting here.  Five in the morning.  I mean, there were 70,000 people, because I'm party poker, it tells you.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're all over the world.  I mean, it's just amazing how this whole poker thing has just, the craze is unbelievable.  It really is one of those things that have just taken off, and like, a lot of people are  getting sucked into it.  Really.  Because now I have a laptop right next to my bed, and if nothing's on TV and I'm laying  in bed, bloop, I'll pop on.  Will you, Christopher Reeve? 
[01:48:30]  Blow into a tube and gamble?  Because now I got my computer out in the living room, too.  But now I got the laptop.  I just picked up an Inspirion 9200 from Dell.  Very good multimedia computer.  And I noticed, this is something we were talking about in the office also, it's got  the wireless network card built in.  So I go to the hotel, stay in there for the next couple of days, and I turn it on, and 
[01:49:00]  10 wireless networks pop up as options for me to just click on.  I'm ready to use the hotel's Ethernet line, you know, plug it in.  There's networks everywhere in the city.  You don't need a connection.  If you're wireless, boom.  You just hit up unsecured networks all over the place.  Buildings, people with their little, you know, hubs that they got, their routers that they  got, and their apartment buildings.  You just tap right into them.  And you're online.  Isn't it safer to use the other one, though, the hard wire? 
[01:49:30]  I prefer the plug-in.  It's safer.  It's faster, too.  So, but it's, if you want to go tinkering around and see if you can pop into somebody's  network and look at their computer also, because not only are you getting their online connection,  some of these unsecured networks, you could actually do file sharing.  So you look into their computer and check it out.  You know, it's funny, because I use the wireless in the hotels all the time, too.  And I said just one time recently, I got home, I said, you know what, let me just check.  And I mean, I live out here in the middle of nowhere, out in central Jersey, and I have 
[01:50:00]  like four or five wireless networks that I just use.  They're not even mine.  I guess they're my neighbors or whatever.  Yeah, we're at a time now where there's so many people with wireless internet that it  doesn't matter where you are, you can pop right on them, piggyback on anybody's system  and get online.  Yeah.  What's fun to do is if you open up like a MS Word document and just type messages and  print it out on their printer, you can find your printer.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Just like, hey, how you doing?  It just prints out on their printer.  Oh, yeah.  If something, that absolutely can happen. 
[01:50:30]  It's a network.  You're in their network.  And if they don't have their printer secured or any of their files, sure, you can do that.  You can check out their computer.  Depending on what they have unsecured on their computer, you can look into any of their files.  That is wild.  Yeah, you got to watch your ass, man.  Technology.  Yeah.  Freaky.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  You're real low.  The volume's real low on the phone here.  Yes, it is.  We keep it that way on purpose.  And I just want to ask you, when are they going to be airing the poker tournament on 
[01:51:00]  TV?  I'm not sure when it's airing.  Their new season starts up in March sometime, so I'm sure it's not too far after that, and  hopefully...  Are you going to get FaceTime on TV?  If I make some noise, you know, if I'm one of the first out, it's not going to, you know,  they're not going to show crap.  But then again, are you allowed to say if you got knocked out, or is it like reality?  No, I think I've got to wait.  Yeah, we can't...  Well, when you're broadcasting with me on Thursday, I think people will figure it out.  People will figure out that I'm not in it, but I don't think we're allowed to... 
[01:51:30]  We're not allowed to tell who won, or anything like that.  Well, maybe you could throw it up on the website or something, so we could check it out.  Yeah, I think last year, the one celebrity that made it the furthest was, like I said,  the guy from the kids in the hall.  He hosts the poker show now, Celebrity Poker.  Foley?  Foley.  Yeah.  He got to 11th place, which is pretty respectable, but doesn't even make the final six at the  final table.  Wow.  Got to be the final six people to make that final table.  Get the fuck out of here.  Ain't happening?  I severely doubt it. 
[01:52:00]  I watch these guys.  You see how they play.  It's so rare that an amateur...  That guy a couple of years back, Chris Moneymaker, he's a huge name now in poker, but he was one  of those guys that was playing online.  How do you know all these guys with names?  Because they're huge stars now in the poker world.  You got their trading cards or something?  Oh, please.  They're huge stars in the poker world now.  Maybe you'll do well because you're so unpredictable.  Maybe that's it.  I'm unpredictable.  Look, I play like crap.  I love me. 
[01:52:30]  With a name like Chris Moneymaker, I mean, he's almost destined to do something like play  poker.  Like play poker.  Good point.  Apparently my name is Jim Log on the chest.  And Opie's cement shits.  We're just a mess in this studio.  Eric from Kansas, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Pretty good, Eric.  Hey, you guys ought to go next year, you guys ought to go out to the Computer Hackers  Convention out in Las Vegas.  I think that'd be some, I think you guys would have a lot of fun out there. 
[01:53:00]  Go do some war driving.  War driving, that's what they call it.  What's that?  That's driving around looking for open networks, wireless networks.  Yeah, you'd be surprised.  I mean, I'm in a small town with about 6,000 people, and you'd be surprised how many people  leave their networks unsecured, and they leave the public password on their routers, and  you can get in there, and you can fuck with them.  And, you know, you look at their, what ports they got forwarded and all this other crap,  man, you can really fuck with people over their wireless networks. 
[01:53:30]  Dude, when is the Hackers Convention?  You know, I'm not sure when it is.  I know they covered it last year on Tech TV, but I think it'd be fun.  I think it'd be fun to go out there.  Those guys are really geniuses, some of them, man.  They're 16 years old, and they can get into Pentagon files.  Yeah.  I'd love to chat with one of them to get me some porn passwords.  Got an instant feedback.  Here's an idea.  Ant, just have Norton come by the poker table and rip a good one.  You win.  It would be so distracting to them, they'd have to fold their hands, 
[01:54:00]  and just walk away from the tapes.  You've got to let one fly while we're broadcasting live.  That would be hilarious, man.  Get me a regular Starbucks a little half and half an hour later.  The spoiled milk treats will be abundant.  All right.  Is Kelly coming in or what?  We were finally going to do the HBO Dwarf audio.  My guess is that...  He was supposed to be here at 7.30.  And my only guess, because Bob wouldn't miss this,  my only guess is that he might be on a plane coming back from Vegas or something that was delayed. 
[01:54:30]  Unless he might have been on an overnight flight.  The red eye.  Bob always calls.  We've tried calling him.  Oh, the delays.  There were huge flight delays at the airport.  Yeah, thank God we weren't leaving today.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing.  We'd be in a heck of a way to write or wrong, guys.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break, then.  Write or wrong.  Write or wrong.  We'll take a break.  We'll regroup.  Talk about maybe Hunter S. Thompson killing himself.  Offing himself.  It's just absolutely shocking.  Yeah.  What a shock. 
[01:55:00]  It's about time, right?  And Sandra Dee died.  Oh.  Whatever.  And then we've got to talk about the REO Speedwagon Journey Sticks cruise that you can take.  Oh, my God.  Where is it?  That Christopher Street?  What?  How awful.  You've got to see the pictures in the paper today.  They're just horrendous.  Is it really them?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll get into the story next.  Never has the world needed an old World War II mind to resurface.  I like sticks. 
[01:55:30]  You do?  Yeah.  Tommy Shaw, Dennis DeYoung.  I don't remember the other two names, but Babe was the first song that I actually identified  with a girl.  Really?  I would walk around on my recorder and pretend I was singing it to Jill, who I liked.  All right.  We'll talk about Jill.  Faggot!  I wasn't a faggot.  I wasn't singing it to Joseph.  We'll talk about Jill, we'll play Babe, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  Bob, I'm leaving.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, God.  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'll bring it to him.  Stop it.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Bring some pleasure.  Can't fight my guy, no test shot. 
[01:56:30]  Psycho-thematic, out of his pain.  I'm fine, my guy.  Take him, inhale.  You're the big six.  I'm fine, my guy.  Exhale, exhale, exhale.  Hey, Milton.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Buttercup.  How you doing, Milton?  Good, good.  I saw you last week.  Actually, we've got a fantastic show. 
[01:57:00]  Where?  Oh, wow.  Stress Factory.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, Stress Factory.  Oh, the big stress factory.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, so I was saying, I was out at DEF CON.  That's the hacking convention out in Vegas.  A few years ago, a friend of mine was really big into hacking and stuff.  Ironically, I work in the field of stopping hackers.  But, yeah, like, they actually have, like, convicted felons who've been convicted of, you know, hacking  into government files and whatnot, and they do speeches.  They just come out and do lectures and show you exactly how to do it. 
[01:57:30]  And they have PowerPoint presentations.  They give you a CD of PowerPoint presentations.  It's amazing.  Don't they use a lot of those guys, too?  They employ ex-hackers to actually figure out how to block hackers?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, hires, like, you know, a bunch of them just because they can.  And that's the thing.  Like, all these 13, 14-year-olds, they don't mean any harm.  They don't really want to, like, you know, fuck with anyone.  But they just can.  And that's the reason why they do it. 
[01:58:00]  Dude, if I was that age, I missed that by a few years.  For me, it was bricks through the windows and breaking bay windows.  If I was 10 years younger, it would have been computer viruses.  That would have been great.  I wish I would have known how to do it.  I knew some kid once hacked into what was called the Whopper computer.  It's a master computer for the military.  And actually had to play tic-tac-toe in order to stop global annihilation.  Yeah, yeah.  Hello.  It's pretty amazing. 
[01:58:30]  Joshua.  Oh, you heard about that.  Yeah.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  How about a nice game of poker?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  They all laugh.  I can't find the story.  Which one?  I had it.  I don't know where I...  What story?  I'll go find it for you.  You could take a cruise with old bands.  Ooh.  And they had pictures of these old rocker chicks that purposely, you know, went on this cruise  to hang out with REO Speedwagon, Journey, and Sticks. 
[01:59:00]  Dressing up like they used to with the clubs?  Yeah, they got the bad hair and stuff.  Tight spandex.  And they had a picture in the paper of the girls getting their picture taken with like,  I don't know, like the drummer from REO Speedwagon and they're all excited.  Oh.  And I guess you take these cruises and the bands play.  Great.  You know, you got REO Speedwagon playing in the lounge area.  Then you get Journey and Sticks.  And the people that go on these cruises, they're like, yeah, it's really cool because you get  to interact with these bands. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, because you're on cruise with them.  So you're hanging with them.  Right.  They can't run off somewhere.  They're on a boat.  All of a sudden you go to, you know, dinner or lunch, whatever, and at the buffet, there's  the dude from, you know, Sticks.  It's probably, I, all right, Eric, I ripped it out of there.  That's what I was trying to tell you.  So it might be in the office.  Hawk, find it, please, rope.  Just take it out into the ocean and blow a big hole into the bottom and watch it sink  beneath the surface. 
[02:00:00]  That really should dock in Yemen for a little while.  Oh, Steve Perry's waving at them as they come up.  A couple of rafts pulling up.  It's these theme cruises that they're starting to take off a little bit.  Oh, yeah, because people love nostalgia.  Here we go, here we go.  And they love a captive audience.  Here it is.  Yeah, one for the photo album.  Dave Amato, guitarist for REO Speedwagon, makes two fans very happy.  Guests say the best part of the cruise was interacting with band members.  Yeah, it's not like just watching them and then they can leave and you can give them 
[02:00:30]  their privacy.  We can bug them at dinner and breakfast and at the pool.  REO Speedwagon on lead vocalist and guitarist Kevin Cronin called the cruise the most positive  experience he has ever had with fans.  The concert by Styx included their classics as well as a Beatles cover.  There you go.  These guys were selling out arenas.  Now they're playing their hits on a cruise ship.  On a boat.  Too much time on my hands. 
[02:01:00]  Renegade was a good song.  Oh, you liked Renegade, did you?  Sure did.  Sure.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  Back in the day for my life on the long arm of the law.  Nice.  Lawman is putting into my running and I'm so far from my home.  Good stuff.  I'll say.  This is where it jazzes up a little.  You can really move to it.  Yep.  Oh, not yet.  I can hear you are crying. 
[02:01:30]  You're so scared and all alone.  Hangman is coming down from the gallows and I don't have very long.  Yeah.  Two chickens up and used it up.  They finally found me.  The renegade, who had it made.  The street for a bounty.  Never more to go astray.  This will be the yesterday of the one in hand. 
[02:02:00]  What?  Back.  Oh, mama, I've been giving them a laugh.  I've had a hard rush on my head.  Long as it's dead and dead on the line.  I wish for sure he'll see me in the air.  Right.  Ugh.  So basically you go on these seven day cruises and... 
[02:02:30]  Seven days?  Seven days.  Seven days.  Set aboard the Carnival Triumph and co-produced by radio giant Clear Channel.  Of course.  Clear Channel owns everything.  The seven day rock and roll holiday cruise departed Miami on a Saturday last November.  Headed for Mexico, making stops in Grand Cayman and Ocho Rios, Jamaica.  But these sunny destinations were just backdrops for concerts by Styx, Journey, and REO Speedwagon.  Who would also be participating in Q&A sessions and mingling with us non-rock stars at cocktail parties. 
[02:03:00]  I like to put them all in wheelchairs and roll them off the back of the ship.  Give them the old Leon Klinghoffer.  Oh, playing the Achille Laurel this week.  That's got to be great for the band.  They're trying to eat and everybody's got the same flu on one of those stupid cruise ships.  10,000 fat girls with the Norwegian cough.  They all got explosive diarrhea.  I'm going on a cruise.  I'm going on one in March.  Are you going to get to see Journey without Steve Perry? 
[02:03:30]  No, it's not one of these.  Oh, he's not playing it?  He's not in it?  No, and supposedly they're the most popular band on the cruise.  I go on a journey without Steve Perry.  Royal Caribbean.  Going down to the Caribbean.  Are you taking a first class cabin?  Yes, a nice big balcony, the whole thing.  Oh, nice.  I tried to get the bigger one, but it was one with a grand piano in it.  Well, you don't need that.  Well, you know, Joe could get in there and tickle the ivories a little.  We can sing along. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, is Joe going?  Yeah.  It's a whole family thing.  A whole family goes.  Oh, very nice, man.  Oh, yeah.  Will Ratgut be playing on the cruise?  I don't think Ratgut will be playing.  Although, me, Joe, and Dawn do get up there and maybe do some karaoke.  Hello?  Is this on?  What?  Hello?  It's very funny.  You watch Joe and Dawn do Sonny and Cher.  Joe gets down on his knees to make himself look real short.  Oh, it's a laugh riot.  Oh, my God.  The ship just starts. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Sounds wonderful, Anthony.  Amazing how much booze they put on those ships to make things entertaining.  Oh, my God.  No, it's pretty cool because you stop off at a bunch of these resorts,  and instead of having to deal with everything, you just hit the beaches.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you're in St. Martin one day, and then you're back on the ship,  which is, you know, your hotel.  There's casinos in there and stuff.  And then you're off to another location, you know, another cool beach resort. 
[02:05:00]  I can't get into the cruise thing yet.  No?  No.  I didn't think I would either, but the last one I went on, it was such a disaster.  I know.  That's what everyone says.  You can't even believe how cool it really is.  And you've got to pick, like, you can't skimp.  That's the worst thing, you know.  If you're going to go, you've got to really go for it and get a good ship, good cruise line.  You know, I heard carnivals.  Get a window.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Carnival's, like, too popular, I guess. 
[02:05:30]  Royal Caribbean's pretty good.  And, yeah, you've got to get a cabin.  You can't go, well, we're not going to be in the room that much, you know, believe me.  You're in there enough that if you're in the bilge with a little, with not even a porthole  on the side of the ship, it's going to be a problem.  Did Jimmy fart again?  Well, I actually walked out.  God damn, it didn't work.  I left the room to do that, actually.  I was wondering why you left.  Follow you in.  I'm sorry.  Come on, man.  I did leave the room, though.  I was trying to be...  Well, it comes in with you.  I'm sorry, it's lonely.  It's trapped in your pants. 
[02:06:00]  All right, I forgot to pat out.  Wow.  Pat out?  You've got to pat a little bit, but I did actually leave the room to be a gentleman.  I have to get the system down.  Now you've just infected two areas is all that did.  Do you understand?  I've never tried to show that courtesy before.  It's going to take me a little time to learn this system.  Are we supposed to not thank you?  I think so.  Thanks is an order.  Yeah.  Little sixth grade Jimmy Norton who just got his glasses with the little Superman insignia 
[02:06:30]  on each side.  I had a little S because my grandmother thought it would be cool and I'd like it.  Irrelevant old bag.  And this song reminds you of who?  Jill.  Jill.  Oh, dear.  I have a little recorder.  Nice.  Okay.  Walking down the street with a recorder listening?  No, in school.  Oh, in school.  Good better.  Babe, I'm leaving. 
[02:07:00]  I must be on my way.  The time is drawing near.  My train is going.  Sheared in your eyes.  The love beneath your tears.  We have a little kiss shirt to Jimmy and Jill on the back.  She gave me.  I'll be lonely without you.  And I'll need your love to see me through. 
[02:07:30]  Please believe me.  The heart is in your head.  I'll be missing you.  Help me.  Yeah.  But you know it's too late.  Whenever I get weary and I'm had in love.  That's the beauty of these love songs and stuff. 
[02:08:00]  It sounds all nice, you know?  That's why Team America was great with the puppet sex.  Because they always show those love scenes in movies like, you know,  the couple kissing as the sun's going down and stuff.  But when it comes down to it, it's all about the effing, you know?  Sure.  You can sing this song to your little lady, but you're hoping for this. 
[02:08:30]  I never did that with Jill.  We never even kissed.  I tried to ask for it.  This is a giant cock.  I feel like giving up. 
[02:09:00]  You know it's you, babe.  Give me the courage and the strength I need.  Please believe right in soon.  After a rape, you go on breathing, you go through the motions of living,  but your soul has been invaded and despoiled.  To have on top of you a heavy, hairy, sweaty, stinking animal 
[02:09:30]  who thrusts his organ into your inside,  who pushes and pulls and tears.  Pushes and pulls and tears is the ultimate horror.  You know the feeling we're trying to forget.  If only for a while.  Because I'll be lonely without you.  You'd be lonely without her, Jimmy.  And I'll give your love to see you. 
[02:10:00]  Now we're having fun.  Babe, I love you.  Now we're going to do something extremely fun.  Babe, I love you.  Is that him? 
[02:10:30]  Chill.  Chill.  I want to go home, please.  It places the lotion in the basket.  I want to see my mommy.  Please, no.  I want to see my...  That's okay.  I want to...  Put the fucking lotion in the basket. 
[02:11:00]  I want to fucking lotion in the basket.  And I have to...  Incidentally, I have to finish that because when I was in sixth grade, Jill, I had kind  of been my little thing since fourth grade.  Did she know?  Oh, yeah.  She gave me the shirt that said Jimmy and Jill.  Stop it.  And we had never kissed.  And I didn't know how to kiss a girl.  Yeah.  So I asked my father, Dad, I want to kiss this girl.  I don't know what to do.  And this is the advice.  If you ever wonder, by the way, why I pay for prostitutes, you can trace it back.  So I asked Dad, and Dad, I said, how do I kiss her?  And he goes, here's what you do.  You get real close and ask her if you can smell her breath. 
[02:11:30]  And when she breathes on you, you lean in and kiss her.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  That's the advice from Dad.  Ask her if you can smell her breath.  And then hit her with a wrench and bury her in a shallow grave.  That was fine advice.  Did you try it?  Even in sixth grade, I knew that was horrendous advice.  That wasn't it, huh?  We were by a creek in Hidden Lake in North Brunswick.  And I was a big kiss fan.  Everybody knew it.  And I was such a fag. 
[02:12:00]  I didn't know how to ask.  So I'm like, I want to ask you something.  And she's like, okay.  And I'm like, I want to, well, you know what my favorite band is, right?  Oh.  Oh, those embarrassing moments of childhood.  And she pretended that she didn't know what I was talking about.  And she just started skipping rocks.  Oh, boy.  And years later, we were.  Off your head.  Years later, we were talking.  She's like, yeah, when you were a kid, you always had chapped lips.  I kind of tied it in ten years later, I realized. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, that would have worked well if she actually would have caught on to what you were saying.  Oh, she knew what I was saying.  She avoided it.  And then I realized ten years later, it was because of my little chapped lips.  Oh.  Like, she didn't remember that I had asked her that.  What a sap.  I can smell your breath.  I myself cannot.  Migs, he hissed at you.  What's going on, gentlemen?  You will let me know if Dennis DeYoung stops singing, won't you? 
[02:13:00]  Faggot I was.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, I went on one of these cruises with my parents.  It was with White Snake.  And when you're on shit.  Wait, White Snake Cruise?  Oh, my God.  Little North.  I'm not trying to use your word, but it was atrocious.  Did David Coverdale just go around having sex with everyone's girlfriend?  Oh, God.  It could have been that good.  They don't even use electric while they're on the ship.  They don't use electric. 
[02:13:30]  It's all acoustic, which is a scary part.  And now my mom booked another one for, uh, uh, who was it, uh, Queensryche?  You know who they are?  Yeah.  Silent Lucidity.  And Nelson.  Nelson.  Oh, she asked if I wanted to go, and, uh, yeah, I guess so.  So we're going to go down to Houston and see Jimmy Norton in the Houston Improv instead.  No, that was the worst.  That wasn't that bad. 
[02:14:00]  That was the worst.  That was the worst.  I know.  I'm so biased.  That one stunk.  Why do you go on a cruise with your parents?  You're hoping your dad passes out and you can dry hump your mother?  What's the...  Why would you cruise with your mom and dad?  I say hi to my mom and dad on Christmas.  I don't want to hang out in the ocean with them.  Trying to get laid.  Do you have your parents telling you how proud they are?  You're a good boy.  It's like, Dad, I'm working on this fatty.  Can you tell her you want to smell her breath?  Yeah.  Tell her you want to smell the virus that she and the other passengers have.  Maybe she could breathe it in your face. 
[02:14:30]  Heidel on the Instant Feedback writes,  How many times will some idiot ask Dennis DeYoung to play Come Sail Away on the boat  until he jumps over the edge?  That has to be a really bad cruise.  You've got to think that's the showstopper, though.  All of a sudden they play Come Sail Away and they're on the cruise ship.  Because they're sailing on the cruise.  In the middle of the Bahamas somewhere.  Come Sail Away with Carnival Cruise Lines, everybody.  Hey, where's Cartman's version of Come Sail Away?  Are we playing it right now? 
[02:15:00]  Here, give it to me.  Give it to me.  It's the real version.  And what was that?  That version, Cartman's, is really long.  What was R.E.L. Speedwagon's big song?  Time for Me to Fly, Roll with the Changes, Riding the Storm Out.  That would be a great one for a cruise ship.  Riding the Storm Out.  If it was raining outside.  Why are we missing the big R.E.L. hit?  What is it again?  What is that big hit?  Can't bite this feeling anymore.  No.  That was a big one.  That was big. 
[02:15:30]  Quite a few.  What was the big song about the Little River Band I always liked?  Little River Band.  They had one song I really liked.  You liked the song from the Little River Band?  Who didn't?  What was the big hit by that band, for Pete's sake?  You were so embarrassing as a kid.  It was atrocious.  I know what song he's talking about.  Your bad music.  I was a boob.  Little River Band.  Little River Band.  I'll get in a second here.  It's going to be the faggiest song ever, right?  I want to, well, you know what my favorite band is? 
[02:16:00]  Lonesome Loser?  Yep, that was it.  I knew it.  I knew it.  This piece of crap.  Hold on.  Have you heard about the lonesome loser?  Smells her breath and takes no log on his chest.  Have you heard about the lonesome loser?  He's a loser, but he still keeps on trying.  He's a loser, but he still keeps on trying. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, now they rock.  Too bad Jill didn't see me later in the Lords.  Right in the Lords.  I got some.  I got some.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Timmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies in the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always seems to replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs. 
[02:17:00]  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes or half an hour and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you'd relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother. 
[02:17:30]  And I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you.  And I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking special license.  And, but anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay?  Sweetie, I love you. 
[02:18:00]  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  Don't lose.  I'm always new.  Keep the fire.  Don't lose the loser.  But who smiles and tears.  Hey, come here for a minute, Jill.  Mwah!  Okay.  Get under the porch.  It puts the Levoris in the basket.  It does this when it's cold.  What a weird way to get a girl to kiss you. 
[02:18:30]  Ask her to smell it.  And then she'll come over and go.  And while her mouth is like agape.  Yeah, I suppose.  You lean in.  As she's blowing air out, I'm supposed to lock my mouth over hers.  And then just tongue her until she passes out from the lack of oxygen.  Sit down, take a look at yourself.  Yeah.  Don't you want to be somebody, Jimmy?  Someday somebody's going to clap on your chest.  You have to face up.  You can't run and hide. 
[02:19:00]  Woo!  Have you heard about the gig in Atlantic City?  Tickets are on sale.  February 26th.  Make sure you have the date ready before you plug in.  I knew you'd fill in all the gaps, Jimmy.  You forgot ticket master.  You silly goose. 
[02:19:30]  Have you heard about the lonesome loser?  The lonesome loser.  Everyone on that ship.  Have you heard about the lonesome loser?  And Journey's also on it, but not even with Steve Perry?  No.  It's like not even Journey.  Right.  Because he was pretty much Journey.  Yeah.  That's rough.  Hey, Kevin, what's up?  Kevin?  No?  Oh.  Oh, B.  Sorry.  Wait, go ahead, Kevin.  No one heard you. 
[02:20:00]  Start over.  How gay are you that you know every REO Speedwagon song off the top of your head, faggot.  Oh, yeah, because it's not like he spent years in music radio playing these songs.  Hey, I spent at least 10 to 12 years spinning platters.  Yeah.  Spinning hot wax.  Hot wax.  Keep on loving you, REO Speedwagon's big hit.  Keep on.  I'm going to keep.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was a biggie.  That's a nice one.  Take it on the run.  Can't fight this feeling. 
[02:20:30]  Riding the storm out.  They did have quite a few hits back then.  What was it?  Late 70s, early 80s kind of thing for them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, this one.  This was a roller skating song.  It's a nice song to slow dance to.  Would you like to double skate?  This cruise should be with the ship at full speed in the North Atlantic with all the lights  out.  Just hoping. 
[02:21:00]  They play this as everyone's evacuating onto a boat.  Please.  And the bands play on as it slithers beneath the icy waters.  There were no survivors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I please smell your breath? 
[02:21:30]  I don't know what about those men.  It really was serial killer's voice.  Remember.  Shut up.  What the hell was that all about?  Because it was us that made me way before I left.  And we're still there.  Together.  And I'm in.  Every word I said.  When I said that I love you.  I'm in.  People are getting so pissed for playing so much of the song. 
[02:22:00]  Come on.  10 to 15 seconds is enough.  Got to get to the hook.  I'm going to keep on loving you.  Because it's beyond that they don't want to do.  How many weddings has this been at?  Oh.  This dumb couple dances.  Two years later, he's stomping her on the mound.  I'm just going to keep on loving you.  Family looking unlovingly as they're dancing on the floor.  He's got a mullet and a bad mustache.  In no time, she's running to that family going, 
[02:22:30]  Please, can I stay here tonight?  I think he's going to kill me.  One minute they're in love.  The next minute he's kicking in the bathroom door.  I just want to ask you.  Why did you do it?  Why did you fuck them?  I didn't fuck anybody.  Sucked your brother's cock.  I just saw that movie last night.  I love this.  This is the best part of Raging Bull.  She locks herself in the bathroom and he knocks on the doors.  I just want to ask you something.  Why did you do it?  Why did you fuck them? 
[02:23:00]  He tries to be logical.  She's going to go,  Oh, all right, Jake.  Let me explain.  De Niro's attempts at psychology as LaMotta were the best parts.  He says to Joey, his brother,  He goes,  Did you fuck my wife?  And Pesci goes,  What?  He goes,  Just tell me.  Like, come on.  Just get it off your chest.  It'll be fine.  You'll feel better.  We'll have a couple of drinks.  Yeah, just tell me.  It'll be fine.  Awful pop psychology.  Oh, God.  Just saw that last night.  A work of art.  A work of art.  But out of doubt. 
[02:23:30]  All right, well,  I don't know what we're doing on the show today.  We'll take a break.  Yeah, right.  Try to figure this out.  I'll tell you what we're doing, Ope.  We're having fun with a capital F.  We definitely are having fun.  Yeah, we'll play a little bit of,  yes, Cartman doing,  Come Sail Away.  All right.  Just a little.  But Anthony's right.  The song goes on and on forever.  I just don't get the Cartman thing.  No?  No, I'm not a big South Park watcher.  Yeah.  Cartman is hilarious.  I know.  Everybody loves it.  I'm sailing her way, 
[02:24:00]  Sellin' open cards  For the urgency  Cause I've got to be free  Free to face the life 
[02:24:30]  That's ahead of me  I'm bird and the catty  So clam it be  We'll search for to marry  On every share  But we'll share  A load of joy  To carry

[02:28:30]  Aby and Anthony  XM202  A couple phone calls and then we'll move on here  Brad in PA  What's up Brad?  Hello Brad  What's going on?  What's going on with you Brad? 
[02:29:00]  Not much  I'm just calling in because I'm sick of hearing all these people bitch on how they think the show sucks  And they should do this  And they don't like Norton  Your show's great  You guys are in charge  I don't know why the fuck they feel that their input is needed on everything  Check out the big brain on Brad  That's like old news, no?  Huh?  No one's really bitching these days  You still hear them?  I mean I only get to hear the broadcast  Like when you rebroadcast them  Maybe you were listening to a best of or something 
[02:29:30]  We've moved on from the bitching part  Yeah, I just hear the bitching part  It just pisses me off  I'm sick of it  Is that a big kahuna burger?  Say what again?  Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?  That was Frank Whaley  He was also in Swimming with Sharks  The one who got shot  And he tried stand-up comedy at one point  Did he?  And he came into the Boston Comedy Club  And I brought him on  He was actually a very nice guy  Yeah?  And Voss was really rude to him  Until he found out that he was a bonafide actor 
[02:30:00]  And he was like  And he tried to help him  Trying to suck up  Groveling ass  He's the guy that every time I see him in another movie  I go  Who is that guy?  Yeah, Frank Whaley  I know him from somewhere  He was great in Swimming with Sharks  With Spacey  That's Spacey's best performance  Great in Pulp Fiction  That was one of the best scenes in movie history right there  Fantastic  Did you see Swimming with Sharks?  You didn't see it?  No  You talked about that movie about a month ago  Oh, it's a good flick, man  I gotta read that one  You guys got it  Spacey is so good in that  Yeah?  Yeah  Benicio Del Toro's got a little part  What's the movie about?  About Frank Whaley plays this guy who's trying to become it 
[02:30:30]  And make it in Hollywood  Oh, did see it  As an intern, yeah  Yes  Wow, Spacey's a real prick in that one  Spacey is this executive at a movie company  And he's, you know  Can I explain this movie worse?  God almighty  Gene Shallot, I Ain't  It's about a guy who has a phone and he talks on it  And then there's another conflict  But the credits are at the end  So, God, do I suck on ice  Well, maybe we should just get Bernie Getz to do the movie review for us  Maybe Bernie Getz could do movie reviews 
[02:31:00]  Wouldn't that be good?  He plays a big movie producer  And he's a vicious screamer  Yeah  And Frank Whaley is his intern and can't handle anymore  And takes him hostage at gunpoint  Yeah  Very good  It's great  Yeah, well, you'd have to be a genius to think of getting Bernie Getz to do movie reviews  Right?  Because, I mean, the guy hasn't been seen or heard from in 20 years  Aside from this program  20 years, no one hears from Bernie Getz  He shows up on this show  And all of a sudden he's doing movie reviews on what station? 
[02:31:30]  WABC  Who's the unoriginal fuckhead that decided he's going to just take Bernie Getz and do movie reviews?  Who's the guy?  I'm not sure  I read about it in the paper  That's why I asked him about it  Unbelievable  Was he supposed to do movie reviews on this show?  Was he supposed to be our utility nut?  Yeah  We talked about many ideas with Bernie  I think one of them was brought up that it would be cool to have him do movie reviews  You know, there are plenty of things that happen in radio that people go 
[02:32:00]  Ooh, they're ripping me off, Robin  And other jocks say that they're ripping off  The truth of the matter is, a lot of it is just basic stuff that people do  There's common senses of humor and things that, you know, people do the same thing  But I have to say, and I'm never one to go hoo-hoo, ripping me off  Ripping us off a deal  But, for God's sake, Bernie hasn't been heard from in 20 years  Until we drag him on this show  And all of a sudden now he's going to be, you know, the movie review guy 
[02:32:30]  Unbelievable  What if he's doing on Curtis and Kubi?  I don't know  Because one of those guys thinks one way  And the other guy thinks the opposite way  Right  And you get both points of view  What a great dynamic that is  Yeah, really interesting  Yeah, yeah  Ugh  Enough with stupid Curtis  I agree with him on most things, and I still like Kubi better  Oof  Yeah, the mobsters with the lobsters  We get it, you're a regular Joe  Shithead  Let's go to Mike in Jersey  Mike 
[02:33:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey  Hey, can you hear me okay?  Yeah  Alright, cool  The one news story that you guys have passed over during the snow coverage  Is the ass munch standing in front of the mounds of salt with the salt trucks  Every snowstorm  And in a couple hours these guys will be outside  Hey, ready for the snowstorm?  And then there's some schmuck going, yeah, we're going to be out there with the salt  Yeah, the news program's doing the snow coverage today  Oh my God, it sucks  It's the same three stories every snowstorm  Maybe you can just run the old tape and never change it 
[02:33:30]  There's nothing out there, by the way  Nothing  Yeah, the snow's melting fast, so I don't know why they're covering this storm  How was it coming in from my L.I. aunt?  Don't know  Oh, I'll tell you what you did  Stayed in town  Ha ha, I was smart  I thought of you, I'm like, I wonder if it's like, you know, really nice  Thanks for thinking of me  Yeah, no, no  No, no, I stayed in town  Steve had a rough commute  Did he really?  Yeah, he had to go out and shovel  That's hilarious  That's a problem with living in the suburbs  Double, he just walks up and down his job and all melts away  His boots 
[02:34:00]  It's amazing, his boots  I thought, like, I thought we weren't even going to do a show today  I was convinced Anthony would be stuck or somebody would be stuck  On my vehicle  And I signed in to five and you beat me in and I'm like, what?  Yeah  I had a little short walk, that was it  I wasn't sure if we'd do a show considering the rest of the country is off on President's Day  But then I remembered  We're not  We're a very dedicated radio program  We work for a living  Are they off down there in D.C.? 
[02:34:30]  Yes  It's a company holiday, yes  It's a company holiday  Yeah, they're out of Washington  That's what you do down there  What about here?  At these lovely studios  Will people be showing up?  Well, the Oompa Loompas  I saw Frank's Place guy  When I came in, which was, you know, very early  He was hard at work in the production  We like him now  We like him now  He's a nice guy  I know  Yeah  Got no problems with him anymore  What do you think Eric Logan is doing on President's Day?  Do you think he's looking in the mirror and realizing that his haircut is like Kim Jong-il? 
[02:35:00]  Wishing it was Dictator's Day so we could  Spending the holidays  Amiring his hair  Yes  Oh, that's a good visual, man  He does have the worst haircuts  Oh, it's atrocious  And they all just get worse and worse  He really should be selling nukes to the Pakistanis  I think it's actually a good haircut if he, like, brushed it to the side 
[02:35:30]  But it just falls really flat  His bangs fall flat in front of his  If he brushes it to the side  Then cut his head off and put it on a Lego person  It's a perfect haircut  That's funny  People seem to be complaining about the bits that are running between our segments  You know, during the breaks  Right  And I've heard that, too  The comedy bits that are played  Like now, it's Brian Regan  I've heard that one a million times 
[02:36:00]  I thought they weren't doing comedy bits anymore  No, no, no  We've almost got it fixed  Okay  That's almost fixed  And then there's another one that, oh my god  I must have heard a million times  And I'm trying to block it out of my head  That's why Jim's commercials are now running  For Jim's shows  And Steve's  We've got a book  There's a Los Angeles promo  We just had to fill it up with content  But within the next few weeks  It's like the same  Same cook  It's like five of them running  It's pretty much five comedy bits running  Well, I've heard Dane's tickling bit like a couple times  Monopoly  Monopoly  Yeah  I've heard a million times now 
[02:36:30]  Brian Regan  Hook it on Pahanex  Work it for me  That was one thing I just gave up on months ago  I know  Gave up  I mean, we were talking about it over and over again  And no one could really figure it out  So I'm like, eh, alright  We'll control what we can  That's what they say in Washington  There's things we can control  And things we can't  I know what we can control  This is in the bucket we can't control  But I, seriously  You know  People think I bitch a lot  Whatever  I do  But, you know  I gave up on that one  So  I stopped bitching about that  Because I knew we weren't going to win that  It'll be out soon, though 
[02:37:00]  Ben says it'll be out soon  I believe Ben  Ben does a lot of things  He doesn't lie  Jimmy brought up that  His father gave him advice  On how to kiss a girl  Yes  With the, you know  Smell her breath thing  Yes  And there's a lot of things  That we haven't gotten to  In the last month or so  And I just noticed that  We have the Katie Couric thing still  Katie  The 411 on teens and sex  Anyone see this on TV?  Ooh  No  Katie Couric got a bunch of teenagers  From all over America  To come to some kind of retreat area 
[02:37:30]  Teen sex  And then just talk openly about  Yeah  What's going on there  You know  They know exactly what to do  We said it in the past  We said it  When we were working at NEW  Teen  Put teen in front of anything  And it makes it more gooder  Yeah  And people will tune in  And they  They took the ball  And ran with it there  Teen sex  As long as you make it  You know  Informative in some way  You can get away with this stuff  On TV  Meanwhile  Who's tuning in  To get information from this?  You're tuning in to hear  Teens 
[02:38:00]  Talk about  Provocative subject matter  Like sex  So I picked out a few clips here  Oh  Learning the terminology  So Katie Couric's sitting around  Just asking some  Rapping  Having a rap session  With the kids  Right  About sex  Learning some of the terminology  This way the parents  Will be able to hear this  And they'll know  What the kids are talking about  Exactly  And be hip  And one of the  Exactly  This never works  So the moms and dads  Out there 
[02:38:30]  Can understand  Their teenagers  That language you speak  I'm  I'm hep to it  I'm a hep cat  So learning the terminology  Of the teenager  Alright  To walk in their shoes  You need to learn  Their language  Terms like  Hooking up  Friends with benefits  And these days  The bases  Are a whole new ball game  I'm Maya  I'm 14 years old  And I'm from Oregon  First base would be like  Kissing  Second base would be like  Making out 
[02:39:00]  Third would be like  Oral sex  Oral sex  The new third base  Nice  Yikes  Yikes  And she'd like  Spray her legs out  On top of the table  Almost every parent  Has heard some shocking story  But we wanted to get the truth  Behind the rumor mill  Huh?  Wasn't that copping a feel  Back in the old days  Third base  Third base was just getting  A little booby I think  Right?  First base  Or maybe the top of the patch  First base  Wait a minute  First base was kissing  Second base was feeling booby  Second base feeling booby 
[02:39:30]  What was third base?  Third base was finger  Right?  Getting your finger down there  And come on  Home run  You all know what that is  So it was kissing  Well now it's  Boobage  Now it's blowjobs  Wow  Third base  Now blowjobs  I would definitely sacrifice  Second base being  Feeling up  If you could go to third  And get a BJ  Yeah  That's amazing  That means a home run  Is more than just sex now  Jeez  Home run  I think they upped the ante  A little bit  Home run is a dump 
[02:40:00]  On the chest  Home run  Jesus  Regular sex with  With a finger  It's like a  I don't know  Sex with two of her friends  Wow  Who knew  Huh?  And now here's  Kirsten  16  Talking about oral sex  Yes it is  Kirsten  See but it's informative  So they're allowed  To have a teenager  Talking about oral sex  On TV  See we just have to be  More informative  When can we get  16 year old girls  In here to talk about sex 
[02:40:30]  Um  How about when we get  Back from LA  How about tomorrow  Before we go to LA  Right  No one really knows  The impact the culture  Is having on today's teens  But one thing is clear  At least from our group  They're definitely not shy  When it comes to  Talking about sex  My name is Kirsten  I'm 16 and I'm from Georgia  I don't think that oral sex  Should be expected  In a relationship  But unfortunately  I think it is expected  In a relationship  Good luck honey 
[02:41:00]  Yeah  What a party pooper  She sounds like  Teenage dud  She didn't sound like  She was very into it  She doesn't think  It should be expected  But unfortunately  It is  Unfortunately it is  Yeah  But I got news for you sweetie  It's expected on the first date  In the car  Dope  Alright more  This is oral sex  To avoid real sex  And pregnancy Anthony  That's why the kids  Are doing it these days  Like you don't want to  Be the person  That's gone the furthest  But then you don't want to  Be the person  That hasn't kissed  Or touched a boy  My name is Tasha 
[02:41:30]  And I'm 14  And I'm from Wisconsin  My name is Settin  I'm 14  And I'm from Wisconsin  My name is Erin  I'm 14  And I'm from Wisconsin  Erin, Settin, and Tasha  Are BFF  Best friends forever  They first heard about  Oral sex from classmates  I was thinking BF  Yeah  BFS  BFF  S  Best friends forever  Oh yeah yeah 
[02:42:00]  BFF  Yeah  It should be BFFE  Best friends forever  Right  Yeah it's not  Best friends for  Best friends for  BFF  Around 6th or 7th grade  I was like  Ew  What?  You put your  What did I miss?  Well  It sounds like it's  Gear enough to be good though  Yeah something really good here  Oral sex from classmates  Around 6th or 7th grade  I was like  Ew  You put your mouth where?  Like  Gross  Like it just  At first it kind of disgusted me 
[02:42:30]  Now in 9th grade  They say  They get  Why kids are doing it  Yeah  I think girls get pressured  Into it  Like I think if their boyfriend  Wants them to have sex  Like they'll be like  No but I should be like  Oral sex  Like I think some girls  Use it as an excuse  Like it comes to not have sex  What a great excuse  And it's not just in Wisconsin  According to our national study  40% of sexually active  Young teens  Have had oral sex  At least once  To avoid having intercourse  68% also say 
[02:43:00]  They did it to avoid pregnancy  In fact  Teen birth rates  Have declined  In the past decade  Thanks in part  To the blowjob  To pregnancy prevention programs  And AIDS awareness campaigns  Better sex education  And more emphasis  On abstinence  Seem to have influenced  Teen behavior too  Thanks to the gulp  So has all this talk  About the risk  Of sexual intercourse  Unwittingly encouraged teens  To try oral sex instead  Yes  Yes it has 
[02:43:30]  Wow  I don't know  That was  I'll tell you  Back in ye olden days  It was a lot easier  To get laid  Than it was to get a blowjob  Absolutely was  And school?  Yeah anywhere  Maybe for you  Anywhere  It was just easier  When you hooked up  It was much easier  To get laid  Than it was to get a blowjob  That might come  After you got laid  What did you just say?  The 50's stunk  Well I'm not talking 
[02:44:00]  About the 50's  Are you insane?  No but I'm saying  That's the way it was  Back then  Yeah Jimmy we agree  What?  Ba ba ba ba  There I am  In my t-bird  Oh I don't mean  With your duck tail  I don't mean you guys  My leather jacket  With lords written  On the back  No I don't mean you guys  That's funny  They shave their hair  So it don't get  In their eyes  When they fight  Who are the  Portumbaldies  No the fat  Bob Kellys  No I was just saying 
[02:44:30]  In the 50's  You would marry  These chicks  You'd knock them up  And you'd get married  When you're 21  It's just awful  The Hummers are fantastic  And I think oral sex  Is more popular  These days  Because people  Are keeping them  Nicer down there too  Yes  Oh you think  That's something  Oh my god man  Dude  You've seen like  The bush shots  From like the 70's  And stuff  Smell like  Tippy Tom's mouth  Seriously though man  As a teen  Did that really matter  Did that really matter 
[02:45:00]  At all  Especially teen  You know  It's all sweaty  Down there  Because it's all  Just matted hair  And  Did it matter  Not a bit  Kind of like  Brush it aside  To find the area  Where is that  Where is it  Just the worst  Oh jeez  I used to perform  Oral treats  On this girl  Who was like 15  And my friend  Was in love with her  And I would say  Alright man  Just drive around the block  I'm going to talk to her  About you  And then he would 
[02:45:30]  Drive around the block  And I would  Perform oral treats  On her  Oh you scumbag  They weren't dating  Though I was awful  That's great  And then one time  She was going down on me  But I was really sweaty  Because I was drinking  Back then  So I was drunk  It was in the summer  And my balls  Reeked so bad  I actually put  Baby powder on them  But it became  Like pancake powder  And she was going  She started going down on me  And three seconds into it  She went  I was laying  Embarrassed  This was actually  Behind her house  On her patio furniture 
[02:46:00]  Oh Aunt Jemima sack  Oh yeah  Turn my mic off  I didn't turn it off  You saw my hands  You did turn it off  Do you have a button  Over there  No  Dude  My hand wasn't  Anywhere near that  That was weird  Oh Aunt Jemima sack  That's funny  Alright let's go back  To the audio  This is a clip on  Wearing protection  During oral sex  Anthony  Do boys wear condoms  When they're having oral sex  No  I don't think  They shouldn't  They don't  They're like  What's the point then  You don't get me feeling 
[02:46:30]  Blah blah blah  My name is Stable  I'm 15  And I'm from New York  Oral sex is sex  Like I disagree  When people say  That it's not  And 77%  Of the young teens  We surveyed  Agree  That oral sex  Is sex  But it seems  It's not considered  A rite of passage  More than half  Say kids who have  Only oral sex  Are still virgins  You are  Well yeah  You know  Until you jam it in there  It's pretty much 
[02:47:00]  Virgin  Absolutely  Virgin  So there's 25% of them  That don't think it's sex  That's great  Yeah  Those are the ones  You gotta aim for  That's terrific  That's terrific  Girls like to give  Then receive  Anthony  What?  They don't like guys  Going down on them  Why  These teenagers  Whatever the reason  According to our survey  Oral sex is almost always  A one way street 
[02:47:30]  I think the girls  Just want to get it done  Get it over with  And have that be it  And just  I don't think they're comfortable  Enough to get it done to them  And also like  For a girl  Like you have to completely  Like you know  Show everything  Girls give it more  Because I think  They're less confident  Than guys are  They're less confident  With their bodies  What is in it  For the girls  That he likes  Yeah  Self-esteem  Self-esteem  Oh he likes me  And I really want him  To like me  You want to be popular  And stuff  You satisfy them 
[02:48:00]  And if you're like  If you have a relationship  Or you care about them  If you satisfy that  Satisfy that person  It makes you happy  Here's what's in it  For a girl  A lip that isn't fattened  And stupid chick  The word is comfortable  Not comfortable  Do you eat vegetables too  Idiot  Vegetables  The pressure of the life  In the interview  You know  Katie right there  She got a little nervous  Well that's some  Amazing information there  The girl's a little scared  To show the speech  And they don't really  Get into doing the oral sex 
[02:48:30]  They just want to  Get it over with  But they want to  Satisfy their man  Their boy  But they don't want  To go down  They don't want  The guy going down  On them  Because they're  Not confident  About their  Well if you think about it  You know  A guy could just  Kind of unzip  Whip it out  And the girl  Has to take off  Or completely  Take off her pants  Yeah  Unless you want  That zipper mark  In your chin  Slap down to your knees  Could you  Would you  Give me a little room  Would you  Do you want to kiss me 
[02:49:00]  Or  I'm going to kiss you  On the mouth  Exactly  Alright  I like how they say  They do it  For self esteem  That's perfect  Wow  That is fantastic  Well when you're  Touching their head  While they're doing it  You're saying  Ah you're good  That's good  Right  Kind of boosting  Their confidence  Good girl  Good girl  You never point out  False when they're  Doing that  No  You know you're  A little tardy  Let's see 
[02:49:30]  Hooking up  Friends with benefits  These current songs  They're using  There's something else  Going on in teen culture  And love has nothing  To do with it  Really  Sexual encounters  With no emotional  Strings attached  It's called  Hooking up  Hooking up is kind of like  A one night stand  Like you just  Fake out with him  Or her  You can do anything  But it's like  A one time thing 
[02:50:00]  Or  Friends with benefits  A friendship  With sexual perks  But no commitment  I'm Sam  I'm 16 years old  And I'm from Maryland  I think you could  Compare friends with benefits  To the driving range  There's no commitment  To playing a round of golf  And you just go there  Work on your game  Figure out what shots  Are working for you  And practice up  So when you do go out there  And play the round of golf  You've got the practice  And you know what clubs  Are working for you  How common is  Friends with benefits 
[02:50:30]  You know what would have  A great golf comparison  If he said  You know you just  Jack off looking at her  In a tree  Then her attack her  In the driveway  With a golf club  With your family's name  On it  That was the worst  Analogy ever  It's like the  Driving range  Go down there  You grab your shaft  And then you  Clean your balls later  What?  What?  That would have  Made more sense  What the hell  He was talking about 
[02:51:00]  I don't know  And is Katie Coric  Was this really news  That it's called  Hooking up?  Hooking up?  She sounds so out of touch  I know  It's been hooking up  Since I was in high school  Yeah  Since the 50's Jimmy  It's true  When poor Henry Winkler  Broke his leg  You alright butchie?  How are ya?  I saw you hooking up  In Times Square  After the war ended  Some nurse  You had her bent over  Kissing her  Telling her  Can I check you  For bad breath? 
[02:51:30]  That is the worst  Actually back then  It was  Could you breathe in my face?  Ask her if you could  Check her for polio  That's how you get  Between her legs  Just see if you could  Check her legs  For multiple sclerosis  I want anal sex  Alright well tell her  You want to see if she has  Cancerous polyps  And put your finger in  And then sneak it in there  Thanks dad  Oh that's great  Get the ones with scoliosis  And tell them you can  Straighten their spine out  How do I get 
[02:52:00]  How do I ask for oral sex?  Well tell her you need  To be checked for AIDS  And just see if she  Pop on it for a second  The worst sex advice  From your pop  It's horrendous  I would have more respect  For her if you could  Just belt her in the mouth  And kiss her  While she's passed out  Like I did to mom  How do you think  You got here son?  Common is friends  With benefits  Well of the kids  Who are having oral sex  Or intercourse  About half of them  Say they've done so  In a casual relationship 
[02:52:30]  My name's Gordon  I'm 16  And I'm from New Jersey  Having a crush on somebody  It's like  You need to worry about  If the person likes you back  Or if something  Could actually happen  It's nerve wracking  At this age  I don't want  A really serious relationship  I'm like 14  I don't want to stick  With a guy  For like a year and a half  I don't know  I'd rather have fun  And just be with  All the guys  You nice 14 year old  Slut you  Yeah  Wow  Making mommy and daddy  Proud  What a little TV  You a bag 
[02:53:00]  Love it  That household's  Going to have  A lot more of dad's  Friends coming by  Unexpected  Hey  Saw your daughter  On TV  Bob figured I'd come over  And go over a few things  We didn't get to  At the office  Right  Daughter around  She's getting so big  Yeah  Make us a couple of drinks there  Let's say hi to Liz in Florida  Hey Liz  Hey guys  What's up  Well I wanted to let you know 
[02:53:30]  The reason that girls  Don't want  That  They don't really care  If you go down on them  Because they don't get  Anything out of it  They're too young  Unless they've been  Touched as a child  You know  Pre  Worked up  When they were younger  They're not going to get  Anything out of  Someone going down  On them when they're that young  You think that  Wait wait  You're saying the girls  Themselves won't get  Anything out of it  No matter how good  The guy is  They're not even in touch  With themselves  They don't even know  What's going on  At that time  I don't think so  It's not much for you guys  To get off 
[02:54:00]  Liz I don't think so  I think it has to do  A lot with the guys  Don't know what the hell  They're doing  Yeah I agree  It's probably a two part thing  But I mean  Talking  I'm 25  But talking with all my friends  When we were younger  Now the girls now  Are doing  Stuff way younger  Than we were  But I don't think  They're even going to know  What's going on  You're right  The guys have  Less of a clue  Than the girls do  Yeah  But  They just jet your tongue  In and out of there  And expect to  And you're right  I don't know  If the guys even know  What they're doing  I tell you my technique  And this is what works 
[02:54:30]  I stick my tongue out straight  And I just  I don't bend it  And I just put it across lips  And I move my head  Back and forth real quick  And they love that  Well that's good  That'll work  Keep the tongue stiff  Don't move at all  And make that noise  And keep eye contact  With it the whole time  Yeah she'll get off  In no time  You gotta stop  Like every five seconds  You go  You almost there  You almost there  They love that 
[02:55:00]  Great  And I put my pinky in  And I move it in a circle  Real fast  Alright Liz  Thank you  Okay thanks guys  You know how you can tell  When they're almost there  When your neck is ready to snap  And you're running out of oxygen  That's true  That's when they're almost there  When your head looks like Omar  After he was kicked out of the helicopter  If you can make her come 
[02:55:30]  Five grand  And hey  Hey welcome to the new millennium boys  I just  I'm 24 years old  I just started dating a 19 year old  And it's a whole new world  I'll tell you  Things that  Things that were impossible before  So easy  I start going down on her  The first time I was going down on her  And she says  Hold on  Can I just blow you instead  What do I say  Of course  Or what do I think 
[02:56:00]  Of course  What do I say  Well  If that's what you want  Sure  Beautiful  That's great  He just hangs up on her  Dillweed from Florida writes  BFF  Best friends forever Jimmy  Not BFFE  Forever is one word  You illiterate dolt  Alright sorry  I'm not a 16 year old chick  Maybe this guy knows that 
[02:56:30]  Because he carved a heart  In a tree recently  Fruitcake  You know what BFF is to me  Big fat fuck  This is what first comes to mind  Yeah I picked up a BFF  After a gig  And I couldn't meet anyone else  And I took her back  And then  Monster  D-O-I-H-F  That's dumped one in her face  And then  L-S-I-C-L  That's lied so I could leave 
[02:57:00]  And then I  L-H-Y-C  Pal  That's left or there crying  L-H-T-L-H-T-C  Left her there  Put a Y in there  You did have a Y in there right  I thought you were very talented  I know  I was  So I put an extra Y  That's quite brilliant  Alright  Teens not having sex  Anthony  There are teens out there  That are not participating  In this whole thing  I don't believe it 
[02:57:30]  I'm Danny  I'm 13  And I'm from Maryland  I think the tub  Alright we know why  Danny is not getting laid  Is that Danny IE  Kind of a girl named Danny  Danielle  That can't be a boy  When do you think  Maybe Danny should lose  His virginity  As soon as possible  If Danny wants to lose  His virginity  He should just go to  Room 237  Have his little sweater torn  You want some snatch  Don  Hand jobs  Blow jobs  And 20 fingers 
[02:58:00]  In the ass  My mommy says  I'm not supposed to  Who's Tony  He's the little boy  That comes in my mouth  That can't be a boy  Danny  That's a boy  Danny  That's the only reason  Why this kid's not getting laid  Right  We're not getting anything  I'm Danny  I'm 13  And I'm from Maryland  I think the toughest part  About being a teenager  Is the misconception  That teens  All they want  Is sex  Apparently 
[02:58:30]  That is a misconception  Our survey shows  That 7 out of 10 teens  Between 13 and 16  Are not sexually active  And have pretty much  Stuck to kissing  It seems amidst  All this candid conversation  There's a counter revolution  Going on  Many teens today  Are just saying no  I'm not like somebody  That you can just push around  And like if some guy says  Well if you love me  You'd have sex with me  I mean guys have been  Using that line  Since forever  And you know  And if they loved me 
[02:59:00]  Then they wouldn't  Make me do it  Would ya  Wait a couple of years  There honey  Alright and then  Sarah here  She talks about  Religious  Religious and oblivious  Can I ask a question  Why do we root  Against the good teens  We root against  The good teens  The ones that aren't  Having sex  We're like  Ugh  Sticks in the mud  We're really creeps  We really are  Well cause we know  How enjoyable sex is  And we want these kids  To be able to 
[02:59:30]  Appreciate it  Appreciate the  Joy of sex  Good point  They're going to be  Having it  They might as well  Enjoy it  I stand corrected  When you go to  Confession you say  Bless me father  For I have sinned  And you make the  Sign of the cross  And you confess  Sarah a devout  Catholic believes  Sex is for procreation  She wears a ring  Her mother gave her  As a reminder  Of her faith  I won't engage  In any type of  Sexual activity  Until I'm married  And that my virginity  Is an extremely  Special gift  That I'll give  To my future husband  What about kissing 
[03:00:00]  Oh kissing  That's different  I mean  I'll kiss  Before I get married  What about fondling  I don't know  What that is  And Sarah  Doesn't mind  Not knowing  She deliberately  Shelters herself  From too much  Information  She hadn't seen  Most of the explicit  Images that were  The same old  Same old  For this group  I am so appalled  It grosses me out  And I had to look away  I didn't enjoy it  Oh wow  What a goody two-shoes 
[03:00:30]  Yeah  You say bless me  Father  For I have sinned  Feel bad for the  Lucky fellow  That's going to  Marry her  Oh that's going to  Be a good one  Nice tense  Like  She just tightens up  When you climb aboard  You just feel  Every muscle  Tighten as she  Grips the bed  With her fists  Okay  I'm ready  No stop  Okay  No go  No wait  Oh that's going to  Be fan-fucking-tastic  Like on her

[03:02:00]  Go back in there  And do your duty  If it's your duty  It's like  Do your wifely duty  That's what you do  If she's a virgin  On her wedding night  You just ask  If you can smell  Her breath  And if she says  What do you mean  By that  Then you just  Jump on her  And put it in  Because she's  Your property  That's what a  Wedding band is  You're a piece  Of property  Spread them 
[03:02:30]  And pump a kid  Out  You know what  You should probably  Do  This might sound  Cruel  But jam it in  Her ass  First thing  And then  When you flip her  Over and do it  The other way  The regular way  It'll be like  A breeze for her  That's true  Nice bacteria  Transfer  Give her like  Trench box  She's got a  Disease in her  Vagina  That only like  North Vietnamese  Female fighters  Had  From squatting  In mud pits  Old rice patty

[03:12:00]  And I first started dating  She was 31  And a virgin  And she said  She was going to  Save it until our  Wedding night  And you know  I kind of respected her  But two days after  I gave her  After we got engaged  I went over to her house  And she's like  Come here  I want to show you something  I was like  Alright  We walked in  We went downstairs  In the basement  And it's like  She just shoved me down  On the couch  And she's like  I can't wait any longer  I was like  It just happened that night  I mean  And 
[03:12:30]  It was  She turned into  Like a total  Sex being since then  She was 31  Yeah  She was 31  She just  You know  She had never really dated  She was  She had gone to college  She had worked  And everything else  She just  You know  She never really had  An interest in it  Alright  I got to go to Danny  Thank you Eric  Alright  This could be a good one  And then we'll  Play the last clip  From Katie Couric  Danny  Yeah  Go ahead  Tell your story  Yeah  I was with a girl  This was a couple years ago 
[03:13:00]  It was the first blowjob  She'd ever given  Or anything  She just busted out  And started crying  Right in the middle of it  That is great  So what did you do  Besides cum  Did she give you a reason  Why she was crying  No  I just tried to  Calm her down some  And it didn't seem to work  She just kept crying  Until she went home  Did she finish  Nope  It might have brought back  Some crazy memory  Can you think  Yeah wow  You're good  You should be a psychiatrist  I'm Colombo 
[03:13:30]  Sigmund Hughes  That was really amazing  She was crying  There must be a reason  Perhaps there was  An earlier abuse  That she felt  That brought all  Came flooding back  When she was  Zucking your gawk  Very good  Alright  Wow that's gotta be  Something all of a sudden  Oh this is great  Yeah you're getting  A little  What the  Is she crying  There's no crying  In blowjobs  Here's 
[03:14:00]  She was crying  Over him  Crying  Crying  Musical interlude  Sure was  Like that  That's very nice  Sure  Grabbing his nipple  That was the song  Yeah  I love it  Would you  Tucks it back angrily  Alright here's  The last clip  Katie Couric  Talking to the teens  About sex  How much do you  Talk to your parents  About what you're  Doing sexually  Not at all 
[03:14:30]  Yeah  My mom  She doesn't always  Make it easy  Like it seems like  She's like  Why do you like  Why why why  And the way she says it  It's like she's  Criticizing you  And I can't always  Take her criticism  Even though it's like  In a good way  I think you know  It's just some things  You have to keep  Private to yourself  Maya  The judgment thing  Like I don't want her  To put judgments on me  More I don't want her  To put judgments  On my boyfriend  Cause then it'll limit  Like my freedom with him  What other advice  Would you give to parents  Because I think  All parents out there  Myself included 
[03:15:00]  We want to have  A close and open  And honest relationship  With our children  And we want to help them  Make the right choices  I think it's up to  The parent  To dispel  And go over everything  With their child  And say you know  You shouldn't call people this  Or have some self respect  I mean you know  I think it's one of those things  Where a man needs  To teach his son  That being a man  Is not sleeping around  And a woman needs  To teach her daughter 
[03:15:30]  To have self respect  It doesn't necessarily mean  To limit what she wears  Or whatever  But to have self respect  You can advise them  Of the negative consequences  And you can tell them  Why you would like  Think it's a bad idea  But if they think  That by them coming to you  All you're going to do  Is be like  Absolutely not  You're grounded  You can't leave the house  So you don't do this  Then they're not going  To come to you  What if some of your behavior  Needs to be judged  If I told my parents  Like I was going to have sex  Then I was going to go  Oh have fun honey  Here's a condom 
[03:16:00]  It's not like  They're just going to say that  But then they're not going to  Like sit there and yell at me  And make me feel bad  They would talk to me about it  And explain the consequences to me  But how many parents do that?  Like that's a  That's how many  Mine does  Mine does  Mine does  Well I was going to say that  I mean it's hard for a kid  To volunteer that kind of information  So it's important for the parents  To create an environment  Where they can ask a kid  And the kid can feel comfortable  I mean if not telling everything  At least sharing something 
[03:16:30]  My mom knows everything  That I've done with anyone  Because like I know  That she will support me  Like even if she doesn't approve of it  Stop whining  She's still there and she cares  And that's what I think  That every kid needs  One, two, three  What's more these teens say  Parents shouldn't be afraid  To be up front  About what they did  Or didn't do  When they were young  Everyone says it's so bad  When people say like  Parents are like  Oh don't do what I do  Do what I say  Trying to have a double standard  But honestly  Everybody makes mistakes  You should learn from their mistakes 
[03:17:00]  Parents should share  Their knowledge  And their wisdom  And their experiences  With the kids  Because that's who  You're going to listen to  Stop whining  You're much stronger  Than any message  That you can get  From like a music video  Stop it  Parents don't know it  But I think they do  Have a lot more influence  On us than anything else  Stop whining  Sorry that was boring  That clip  Little psycho babble  In there  You know  They like to lump it all  Into one category  Kids that are having sex  Or not having sex  There's  Believe it or not 
[03:17:30]  You can be a teen  And have sex responsibly  You don't have to  You know  Be the slut  Or the guy that's sleeping around  Or everything  But you can  Have sex  And it's not like  A bad thing  Like you gotta run home  And then tell your mom  That you're having sex  And her thinking  You know  You're a slut  Or you know  That you're a guy  And you're gonna get  Every girl pregnant  And everything  I think most people  Most teens  That are having sex  Are doing it pretty  You know  Fairly responsibly 
[03:18:00]  I think there's those  Fringe ones  That are just  Sucking and fucking  Everybody in school  Not using rubbers  Stuff like that  But I think for the most part  You have a relationship  With somebody  You know  Whether it lasts  A couple of months  Or longer  Or shorter  And then you wind up  Having sex with them  But you're worried  About her getting pregnant  You're worried about diseases  You're worried about  Things like that  And you use protection  And it's you know  It's not just  You met at the  At school  And decided  I'd start having sex  I think they're 
[03:18:30]  Kind of lumping it all  They're making it  Pretty black and white  There you know  Well you can't teach  That kids are having  Sex responsibly  Because society  Is not ready to hear that  It's like when  Jocelyn Elder  Is trying to talk  About masturbation  You know  They crucified her  Yeah  We are a very repressed  Sexual society  You're right  They don't want to hear that  People don't want to hear  Parents don't want to hear  That you know  Your kids are having sex  But they're probably  You know  Having responsible sex  Limited  Not you know  She's not the town slut  She's but  Her and her boyfriend  Have decided  They're going to have sex together 
[03:19:00]  They don't want to hear that  It's either  You know  Don't have it at all  Or you're a fucking slut  And the school tries  To give out condoms  To prevent teen pregnancy  And AIDS  And the church  Yeah  Fights it  Meanwhile protecting  Guys like Paul Shanley  Who had been raping boys  Right  Shipping them from parish to parish  They're protecting rapists  And the school's trying  To give out condoms  And the church sticks  Their dirty  No tax paying  Meddling fingers into it  Makes me nauseous  No tax paying  Now I am upset  With the church  Well you know 
[03:19:30]  They're tax exempt  Bastards  Sickening  Yeah  Let's go to Steve and Queens  Steve  Yeah how you doing  Hey  Hi Ope  Hey sweet kids  Hi Steve and Queens  Welcome to the program  I can just about hear you  Listen  Yeah  On my wedding night  Right  Yeah  My wife was a virgin  Been going out with her  For years  And that night  She was just too busy  To have sex  Because she was going  Through the envelopes  Finding out how much  Money we made  Oh my god  And she was a virgin 
[03:20:00]  Oh yeah  Oh so instead of  Her first night  Being in bed with you  Having sex  She decided to see  How much money  That's how badly  She wanted to have sex  With you  That's it  So what happened  Her wonderful gift  That she saved  I was looking at her  Breasts at the time  What happened to  What happened to this marriage  Oh well  After about seven years  We broke up  Yeah that's obvious  I mean  Wedding night  And she'd rather  Open envelopes  Than finally bang  You know  Yep  That should have been  A sign right there 
[03:20:30]  Did you look through  The envelopes  And go oh  20, 30 grand  And small bills  If this was anybody  Else's wedding  My own  Yep  Well I guess  It would punch out  Before  Alright we'll punch out  There  Let's go to Sal  In Staten Island  Sal  Hey what's up guys  Hey  I have a  Kind of same story  But I was the first guy  That my girlfriend  Had after she was raped  Oh my god  Yeah  So it was 
[03:21:00]  Almost the same thing  That's terrific  You know she was always  Worried about what  What was going to happen  What was going to feel like  And it was  It was pretty strange  Wow  And it took  It took a little while  Actually  Maybe a couple of months  Or something  Before she finally  Was ready to  To really get into it  You know  But we were trying  All that time  And it was pretty bad  And you'd get close  And she'd stop it  What 
[03:21:30]  You'd get close  Like maybe you'd kiss  Or whatever  And she would not  Be able to go through  With it  Yeah yeah  You ever say  Something sarcastic  Like what do I need  A gun  Yeah  That's got  Wow man  You got a lot of patience  Wow  Good for you  It only lasted a few months  Actually I sent you guys  A fax  Years ago  About how I could  Break up with her  And I had used  That rusty trombone line  I don't know  If you guys remember that  Yeah of course 
[03:22:00]  Because we've only had  A million calls  I used it  How to do it  And everything  And when I got into position  She just got turned off  And ran out the room  You were trying to get her  To give you a rusty trombone  No  That's how I got her  To break up with me  Because I didn't want to do it  I didn't want to be another guy  That screwed her over  Right  So I said  You know  Since we're trying  You know  We got through the sex thing  Now let's try other things  And I explained how to do  The rusty trombone  And I got into position  And told her  Start doing it  And she just freaked out 
[03:22:30]  And walked out the room  Oh so you were trying  To be a nice guy  And your idea of being a nice guy  Is kneeling on your bed  With your asshole up in the air  And asking her to lick it  And tug your mule  While she's trying to fight  The memories of being  Attacked in an alley  You really are a good egg  What a catch  Well I gave her the choice  Of course she did  You're a good person  A rusty trombone 
[03:23:00]  Is best with a filthy whore  She'll reach around  And get you off  With her hand  All the while  She'll lick your spot  By your tiny balloon  Do not hope  You didn't eat too much bran  A rusty trombone  May not be moral  While I think  This sounds kind of gay  I'd rather get some oral  With the finger up my butt 
[03:23:30]  But that's me  What the hell  On the knot  Come on honey  Start the music  Yeah  You can play that well  There you go  Haven't heard that  In quite some time  In a long time  The old rusty trombone song  Play that on commercial radio today  A half a million dollar fine  Yep  There you go  That's why  Satellite Radio  Is the place to be  As we go to break  Anthony  One more clip  About being a virgin  Yeah  Let's play this

[03:28:30]  For money  Sing to your penis  Elias  You know how we  You see them balls  Come apart man  You know how we  Were thinking  How to gook  Laughs at you  Cut off your dick  But she's the one  That blue manny  Let's do it  Let's castrate  The whole fucking village  You know how we  Were trying to find  A third thing  For her to do  Yeah 
[03:29:00]  On Friday  And the cherry darts  I think was not  Not the greatest  Grand finale  We've done better  In the past  I was thinking  On the way home  We should have  Had her do a lap dance  To Jimmy  What are you going to  Give us a hundred bucks each  It could have been funny though  Yeah  She did a strip tease  For you  For a whole song  Dude you let me know  When you're going to do that  I'll pop a hundred milligram  Viagra the night before  And I'll wear sweatpants  In here  And let her do a lap dance  I'll wear like silk boxes  And sweatpants

[03:30:00]  That is  Where are we going to  Get the money from though  Will XM give it to us  XM  They have to  They got petty cash  How much did we use last time  At least a thousand  If not more  Was it a thousand  It might have been like two thousand  Two grand  I think it's two thousand dollars  Wow  NEW fessed up with two grand  Oh yeah  And we used singles  Fives  Tens  And twenties  Mostly ones though  Yeah  Bunch of ones  And then we laid them  All over the studio  Hung them up  And we had  How many girls  Five or six probably  About six maybe 
[03:30:30]  Five or six girls  Completely nude  And they went around  And picked up  As much money as they could  As they could hold  Not in their hands  Mind you  They picked it up  With their hands  But they had to store  Every bill that they  Had picked up  In their snatch  So what they would do  Is pick it up  And roll them really tight  And keep rolling  And rolling  And rolling  Until they had a big  Thick wad of cash  And then  They would shove it in there  And have to hold it  In there  And they'd have to stand there  Yeah  Because at the end of the time 
[03:31:00]  They had to drop  Whatever money they had  In their hands  In their hands  And just stand there  With all this cabbage cash  Sticking out of their  It was our take  On the wacky radio bit  That a lot of morning shows do  Where they throw some fat slob  In a bank vault  Yeah  And then blow the money around  And they have to  Pick it out of the air  Yeah  When they'd actually  Pull the money out  It looked like it just went  Through that thing  In poltergeist  Like a tennis ball  Yeah  And uh  Yeah whatever they had  On their body  They got to keep 
[03:31:30]  Yeah  There was a couple twists  We had um  A leaf blower  Blowing the money around  As they're trying to grab it  I remember Rick  Going around  With that damn leaf blower  Blowing the money around  So they're running around  With money jammed in them  Trying to pick up  More money with their hands  Yeah  We had condoms too  If they wanted that  For hygiene purposes  The hygiene  We kept it clean  We kept it clean  It was so  Remember how  They were all messes  Remember  One girl was  We were all excited  Like cool  We get to see six naked women  In the studio today  Oh they were the worst  They were awful 
[03:32:00]  And then remember  The one girl in the corner  Counting her winnings  Crying  Crying  And we asked her  Why are you crying  Crying  And she said  Because now I could buy  My child's Christmas presents  What an O&A moment that was  What a heartfelt moment that was  As we laughed at her  Yeah  Yeah  Here she is shoving money  In her snatch  So she could buy her kid presents  Didn't we disqualify one girl  Because she  What did she do wrong  She didn't 
[03:32:30]  She was holding it with her hands  She didn't stick it up  Her snatch  She was yelling at us  She was like  Getting really belligerent  And stuff  Steve C  Had to come in  I think  And remove her  Yeah  There was a  They were drunk  Some of them  It was just an awful scene  They had to get drunk  The smell in the studio  The smell in the studio was awful  That day  Smelt like ass  Smelt like 55 gallon drum challenge  It was just ass  Oh there's pictures up on  Foundrymusic.com  Of course there is  Of this  Of course  I don't know how you would  Ever go there  And find it  You're never going to find it
