<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show returned from a two-week vacation, their longest ever, addressing listener concerns about a negative segment on them aired by 20/20 Downtown and the subsequent destruction of their website.  They promoted foundrymusic.com as an alternative. Anthony detailed his negative experiences in Turkey, referencing *Midnight Express* and making disparaging remarks about the country and its people, while Opie recounted a scuba diving incident with a Frenchman in Turks and Caicos.  A significant portion focused on a scathing critique of the Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon, questioning its effectiveness and commenting on Lewis' and McMahon's health.  Jim Brewer was a guest in the studio.  The hosts discussed European TV, *Lois & Clark*, and a David Hasselhoff *Knight Rider* album, interspersed with listener calls.  They contrasted Opie's positive Disney World experience with his negative Turkish trip, highlighting cleanliness differences. The show ended with more listener calls and promotions.  The overall tone was characterized by crude humor, strong language, and offensive stereotypes.

The show continued with a discussion about a woman smoking dangerously near her baby, transitioning to a caller's suspicion of data collection on the Universal Studios E.T. ride, jokingly suggesting a Disney conspiracy.  Jim Brewer's departure for a comedy tour was announced.  The hosts discussed Sam Adams beer representative Jim Cook's bicycle accident, with Cook calling in to recount the incident and his injuries in humorous and vulgar banter.  Audio clips of Cook's post-accident comments were played.  Numerous live read attempts for sponsors, including Sam Adams, Dr. Prestone (hair restoration â€“ with a poorly written, offensive script they refused to air), and Hooters (with another comedically bad script), were featured, with a Philadelphia radio station representative calling to comment on the Dr. Prestone script. A listener, Wendy, shared a story about her husband's antics, leading to a discussion about the smell and texture of dried semen on a towel and speculation about infidelity. Opie described a bizarre hotel bathroom fixture in Athens, later identified as a bidet.

The show continued with Opie detailing his messy experience using an Athenian bathroom fixture he mistook for a bidet.  Extensive, vulgar, comedic speculation about the fixture (eventually identified as a foot washer) followed, along with the repeated use of "dip it" in various contexts.  A caller recounted a bizarre African safari experience, another shared a swamp ass prevention method, and another described a similar European toilet experience.  A lengthy call detailed a European trip, followed by a call describing a Disney World trip.  Jim Brewer promoted his rock comedy tour.  Callers shared various anecdotes, and commercials for O2Go water and Paisano restaurant aired.  The conversation remained crude, frequently interrupted, and rapidly shifted between topics.

Opie described a near-panic attack on a flight over the Atlantic, vividly imagining a plane crash.  The discussion involved darkly humorous commentary about plane crashes and airplane movies.  A Pinnacle Horny Goatweed commercial aired.  The "What Did We Learn on the O&A Show?" segment followed, featuring listener calls with humorous and vulgar observations about Spuds Buckley, concussions, Jerry Lewis, and other topics. A bad phone connection interrupted a call, leading to more banter.  They discussed Carlos Mencia's show, with Opie offering questionable impersonations and ethnic jokes. Further crude listener calls followed, including a joke about a bidet mishap and a large maid tip.  A listener shared a story about a 65-year-old woman with breast implants at a Turkish hotel pool.  Another listener told a joke about a black actor playing a Nazi in a Disney show, leading to a discussion about a "Drunk German Ed" with a bullet hole in his head.  The show concluded with promotions for Jim Brewer's show and WWF Smackdown.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Show  How do we work this equipment?  Oh, what'd you forget? 
[00:00:30]  It's been so damn long. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. We are back live!  Live, yes!  Full of energy, baby.  How you doing?  Doing all right.  We've got to prove to people that it's live, though, because how do we do that?  When you're in worst of mode, some of that stuff sounds live, so...  Yeah, all of a sudden we'll come on and say, hey, we're here live, and then it's some Christmas bit.  I think it's like September...  4th?  Is it September 4th? I don't even know.  2001.  2001. We are live, yes. It's a Tuesday. 
[00:01:00]  That's right.  We took the longest vacation of our lives.  Yeah, it is the longest vacation we've ever taken.  We usually barely get a week in. This time, we almost made it to two weeks without doing the radio show.  We milked it.  I understand. Some people are a little upset at our absence.  But we had to get out of here for a little bit.  Yeah.  2020, very smart.  They knew when we were going to be on vacation. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  So they ran that lovely piece on us in the radio show while we were gone.  Thank you.  Now it's not as urgent to talk about it.  Yeah.  Happened like a week ago.  Phone's already lit.  Of course.  All right.  Well, here's the phone numbers, just in case you don't know.  We've got to say hi to Buffalo.  They're live today for the first time.  Oh, yeah.  My old stomping ground.  I spent three years in Buffalo, Anthony.  You did, did you?  At a fine station called the Fox that is no longer. 
[00:02:00]  And hello, Buffalo.  Hey, Buffalo.  Welcome aboard, as they say.  The phone numbers.  We're live, yes.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  If you're anywhere else, we'd love to hear from you as well.  866-2774-WOW.  That's 866-2774-WOW.  Our suspension's finally over.  Our fake suspension.  No fake, no.  No, it was a vacation.  Yes, it was. 
[00:02:30]  A lot of people like to pull the wool over your eyes by saying they were suspended.  No, vacation.  Also, while we were gone, management felt like just completely destroying our website.  Ravaging the website.  Ravaging.  Happened there.  It's something we've got to bring up right off the bat here, because I'm getting hundreds  of email from people all over the country.  People that don't even get the radio show, but they saw us on 2020 Downtown.  Yeah.  And they saw the piece, and they're like, oh, these guys seem kind of interesting.  Let me check them out on their website. 
[00:03:00]  Website has nothing.  Yeah, we're talking about the, not the Foundry Music guy.  No, so I want to give out that site like 10 times today.  Yeah.  If you're a fan of the show, or you want to check out what we're all about, you go to  foundrymusic.com.  Right.  It's not censored yet, but they're trying to do that as well to us.  So it's www, of course, .foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That's foundrymusic.com. 
[00:03:30]  Write that website down.  It's really important if you're into this radio show.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Okay?  Yeah.  Good to be back, though.  Good to be back.  Isn't it?  Should we go right to the phones?  I don't even know where to begin.  Yeah, I know.  We've got to ease ourselves back into show mode.  I haven't even talked to Anthony for two weeks.  No.  Could care less about him.  You were in other countries.  I was in Turkey and Greece. 
[00:04:00]  Dirty countries.  I was in Istanbul.  You were in the filthy country of Turkey.  I was in Istanbul.  Istanbul!  Isn't there a movie about some guy that had to escape from Turkey?  I try not to go to countries that Americans have tried to escape from.  I completely believe it.  Really?  I never want to go back to Istanbul again.  Yeah, what was that?  A Midnight Express.  Was it Midnight Express?  Yeah, he was arrested for the hash.  The hash.  I smelled hash.  That he had hash yeast on him. 
[00:04:30]  And when he tried to get on the airplane, would it tape around him?  Yeah.  You'll get to off.  You'll get to.  I'm a good lawyer.  Get you off.  You'll get six months.  Okay, 30 years.  Guy had to escape from Turkey.  They haven't figured out.  I hope he's vacationing there.  They haven't figured out the hash problem in Istanbul.  Get some good hash?  No, I didn't do it.  Oh, it has his hash pipe.  No.  I used to love smoking the hash, to be quite honest with you.  Years ago.  In college, under the glass.  Sure. 
[00:05:00]  Back in the old days.  Sure.  See, we could talk about, like, drugs and stuff on our show without any PSAs.  You don't have to put it because, hey, you just talk about it honestly, and that's pretty  much what the show's about.  When we play Afro-Man, we don't bleep anything.  I hear there's a radio station playing Afro-Man because they got high or whatever.  They're bleeping, and then some stations are...  They're bleeping the word high.  Yeah.  One of the stations in New York, they play Afro-Man, you know, because they got high,  and they're bleeping high.  They're bleeping high.  Like, why even play the song?  And some stations are playing disclaimers. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, they're telling...  Before they play the song or after the song, they're telling the kids how bad pot is.  How bad drugs are.  And you shouldn't do X.  It's a...  Yeah, that's a way to show your audience that you're cool.  And isn't...  And on the edge...  If you want to think of it in those terms, isn't the entire song pretty much a statement  that it's pretty bad if you smoke the weed all the time, you're going to lose some things  in life? 
[00:06:00]  You have to play a disclaimer before.  Yeah.  Eee, that's bad.  All right.  Honestly...  That sounds like a Dave Dickless move to me.  Oh, WAF, our old station in Boston.  That's one of the stations that...  Why don't we help out the kids?  We've got to put a disclaimer before that.  Yeah, that proves that you're a station on the edge and you're taking chances.  PSA is before you play a drug song.  Before a song.  Oh, please.  Anyway, I don't know where to begin, so why don't we let the listeners help us out, okay?  All right.  We'll get reacquainted with our audience. 
[00:06:30]  Sure.  Why don't we do that?  Let's go right to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  You're the first call.  Guys, welcome back.  Hey, man.  Thank you.  Nice to have you back.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony, did you catch your favorite program this weekend?  What?  The Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon.  Well, I was on vacation, but I did tune in back in the room as I was channel surfing  a little at night, and I did see some of it.  Not only Jerry Lewis, big, big fat guy, if you saw him at all, he really didn't spend  much time on the screen.  All I heard was that he gained a lot of weight, he looks bloated, and he looks half dead. 
[00:07:00]  Well, we know where all that money goes now for the research.  It goes to his diet, the fat pig.  Not only that, but there is something.  Has anyone addressed that there is something seriously wrong with Ed McMahon?  Like, he's got to be.  I give that guy a week.  But he's old, Ed.  That's all.  Yeah, maybe that's all that it is, but I think, okay.  Hey, Jerry's been eating Ed McMahon's food.  That's what happened.  Backstage, maybe.  Why, is it getting thin, and Jerry McMahon's really getting thin? 
[00:07:30]  And you know Ed's whole gig is, he's an announcer.  Right.  So he started, here's Johnny!  And now there's word from kennel ration.  You know, he would be an announcer.  The guy can't talk anymore.  I don't know if he can't see, or his voice is gone, but he goes, I met these young kids  Trumpist websites, but let's now introduce these brand new young stars.  He can't talk!  You know what?  He's continuing the motion.  And Jerry, trying to do some of the shtick he did back in the 40s and 50s with Dino, 
[00:08:00]  where he would play the orchestra conductor, or he'd be doing the air typing thing to the  real fast music, now at his age, I swear to God, it just looks like an old man with Parkinson's.  It's over, Johnny.  He's going into spasms as he's trying to do these bits.  It doesn't, it looks dangerous now.  When are they going to roll Jerry out in the wheelchair?  Do they bring out Charro? 
[00:08:30]  Charro, let's have a big hand for Charro.  Did you see her in a new commercial, too?  Yeah, I saw the new.  Oh, God almighty.  You know, it's time to give up on muscular dystrophy.  It's over, Johnny.  We gave him a lot of time there to come up with a cure.  We did.  We got a lot of time and a lot of money.  Let's move on to, I don't know, look, pancreatic cancer.  I don't see anything happening with muscular dystrophy.  It's the same kids being wheeled out in the wheelchairs.  The wheelchairs look better, though. 
[00:09:00]  Much better.  You see the titanium blue ones now?  They look nice.  They're all motorized.  Every kid's his own little Timmy now.  But with all the money that we've given Jerry Lewis over the years,  I think we should have solved the disease by now.  Yeah.  It's over.  Let's focus on a new disease.  Shark attack.  Where do you want to go?  A shark attack disease.  A new shark attack disease.  Oh, did you see the size of that kid?  No wonder why the shark wanted him.  That kid must have been like a baby seal to the shark.  The kid's a poker.  Did they flip him up in the air?  Yeah.  They beat him with a club after a while, too. 
[00:09:30]  All right, guys.  Listen, welcome back.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Tim.  Keep the rules, and we'll see you later.  All right, Tim.  Be good.  Ah!  Jerry doing all his old shtick.  Do you know, I saw a little special on Jerry.  Every year they do a little special on Jerry and what he's been doing,  how he got involved with MDA.  And they showed him doing a show in Vegas.  Oh, Vegas.  Jerry Lewis.  You know what he does?  He stands there, tells some bad old jokes,  and then plays film clips of his movies and him and Dean. 
[00:10:00]  And film clips of him doing these routines that I guess he can't do anymore.  And he stands there and watches the film with the audience.  I'm like, what the hell is that?  That's a better gig than this show.  That's a good gig if you can get it.  It's like us doing best stuff for ten days.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And getting paid for it.  He just stands there with the audience.  He goes, wasn't I great back then?  Wasn't I great?  And then he tries to do a couple of them, like I said.  You ever see the one where it's like,  and he's typing in the air and pushing the little carriage back? 
[00:10:30]  Well, you know, he was the first Jim Carrey.  Of course he was.  Please.  And then he's doing another bit where he just makes faces.  That's all he does.  He makes wacky faces.  Right.  And I can only imagine the faces he makes are the same ones he makes  trying to squeak out a batch when he's constipated.  He was making, like, constipation faces.  And people paid for this.  How were the kids?  At least you get this for free, people.  How were the kids? 
[00:11:00]  Were they looking extra pathetic over the weekend?  Yeah.  They've got some real pathetic ones.  But they're in better chairs.  So they wheel them out.  Mm-hmm.  And then Jerry goes and they're a tote.  It's over as far as muscular dystrophy goes.  Yeah.  The hosts are dying.  Give it a good whirl.  Well, once Jerry goes, I don't know who they're going to get to replace him.  Let's move on to a new disease that we can try to cure every Labor Day.  Ladies and gentlemen, from my new show, Star for Day. 
[00:11:30]  It's got a new show.  Damn it.  It's called, like, it's, it's, who's a star or some kind of, it's a blatant star search ripoff.  But he's not a lot of use to me.  He's not a lot of use to the stars.  And you're going to treat me half stars.  I'm pissed I missed the telethon.  Yeah.  Well, you've been in Turkey.  I haven't seen.  I haven't seen TV.  Well, I saw some European TV, which is, uh.  How's that?  Quite different.  They're really into that, uh, what was that, uh, show about Superman with, uh, uh, Dean Cain and. 
[00:12:00]  Lois and Clark?  Lois and Clark is huge.  The adventures of Lois and Clark are huge?  Lois and Clark is huge in Greek.  How about Knight Rider?  No Knight Rider.  Because I hear, um, David Hasselhoff and Knight Rider.  Huge show.  Still.  He used to tour and sing, and he'd go out on stage, Opie.  Imagine this, if you will.  Probably better than going to see Jerry Lewis.  Would be, uh, David Hasselhoff standing on a black Trans Am Knight Rider type car, singing, 
[00:12:30]  I'm a Knight Rider baby.  And, and if, if you could go to somewhere, uh, Ben.  Or, or Rick, and try to find David Hasselhoff singing the Knight Rider song.  Yeah.  I'd be indebted to you for life.  Yeah, let's, we have to find that.  European TV.  So that's what you had?  Lois and Clark?  Lois and Clark.  That was the only TV I've seen in the last ten days.  Shut up, Spiro!  Hey, you're the first dick of our, uh, post-vacation.  Shut up.  Shut up for a second.  Please. 
[00:13:00]  I haven't seen TV.  Uh, I didn't read a newspaper, didn't check the internet, didn't read it.  Oh, we found it.  Ah, we got the album.  Oh, nice.  Wait, can you guys do it in the other room or no?  That is killer.  Let me see the, let me see the cover.  I don't think we can play it.  If David Hasselhoff, look, he's on the Knight Rider going to get off.  I don't think we can.  What a dick.  We broke that turntable months ago.  No, we had two in here.  I think, I think that's the one that works.  We're going back to Vidal here at Double Doop.  Uh, Spiro, what's up?  Uh, you were in Turkey? 
[00:13:30]  I was in Istanbul.  Istanbul.  Istanbul, my friend.  My brother went on a honeymoon.  And Kusadasi.  Kusadasi?  Which is an island down the coast of Turkey somewhere near the, like, the Greek islands.  Some filthy little place.  I don't know.  Some filth-ridden little Turkish place.  Kusadasi.  So what's it?  I don't know that island.  I like their...  Anyway, my brother went on his honeymoon.  Yeah.  And he met some guy named Ahmed.  Ahmed?  And was taking him there.  Every place he had, Ahmed had a cousin.  Right. 
[00:14:00]  He took him to, like, St. Sophia.  It's supposed to be a church that's over there.  Yeah.  They wouldn't let him in.  It was like a big museum or something.  And he says, don't worry, Ahmed.  I have a cousin here.  Everywhere they went, he had a cousin, this guy.  Well.  He was taking him all over the place.  Uh, so, uh, so what did you want to say about Istanbul, though?  Istanbul was like, my parents had gone.  They told me that place is filthy.  It's, uh, an interesting place.  There's a bunch of money-grubbing...  That, too.  Whatever they had.  Pay off this one, pay off that one.  Let's try to say, ripping you off.  It's a Nazi.  You can't even walk down the street without someone coming up to you and asking you to 
[00:14:30]  buy a stupid postcard or...  They're impoverished over there.  Their major export is AIDS.  I hear, right?  Is that true?  Sure.  Yeah.  You can't even walk into the bathroom.  They have public bathrooms in there.  They're like pig pens.  Know how pathetic Turkey is in general?  Yeah.  They warned you, uh, that, uh, if you, if you get any Turkish money...  Yeah.  Don't bring it back on the cruise ship.  Don't bring it to the airports.  No one will, will give you American money back for your Turkish, uh, cash.  Of course not.  Remember, uh, in Midnight Express, Rifki, the tea salesman guy, the big fat one? 
[00:15:00]  I give you a tea, my friend.  I picture everyone in Turkey to look like that.  Just be that dirty and trying to get money.  I have not watered down the tea, my friend.  And then the American, he, he, like, gouged his eyes and bit his tongue out.  Remember that one?  That rocked.  I just picture everyone like that.  That, you, your cat, I killed your cat.  Ant, they don't have enough money to be fat in Turkey.  No?  These people are not eating that well.  And, uh, the roads, like, just, like, dirt and cobblestone, and the buildings look like 
[00:15:30]  they're made of clay?  No, surprisingly, it looks like, you know, pretty much a regular city, but you can't  read the writing.  Well, the closest I got to that was the, um, the, uh, Morocco part of, uh, Epcot, which  looked pretty dirty, too, for Disney.  I don't think they polished the garbage pills around the Moroccan Epcot, uh, place.  So I was there, too, Opie.  It was exactly like it, I'm sure.  Just like Istanbul.  Do they wear little things that say cast member? 
[00:16:00]  No?  No.  This is the real thing.  No, my one observation about Turkey?  Yeah.  Wait, this guy's, uh, filth?  No.  Besides the filth?  Yeah.  Every person that lives in Turkey has one of those large, unusual moles somewhere on  their body.  Yeah, you know something?  What's in the water in the, in the foreign countries?  They all have one unusual, large mole.  Mole, my friend.  Mole, my friend.  Right? 
[00:16:30]  Was this it all?  This just blaring in the streets?  Or this?  Hey, that's music?  That is our Britney Spears, my friend.  I'm sure you fit right in with the people there, too, Opie. 
[00:17:00]  I was chum.  You were like...  I was a minority for a week.  Exactly, because you got the blonde hair, very fair skin, and you're with these people just with the big, bushy mustache.  Do they all have the mustache?  They all have mustaches.  They all have the big, bushy mustache.  Yeah, they all have the mustaches.  I just want to say hi to my African brothers.  I understand. 
[00:17:30]  You understand the struggle now?  I understand the struggle, man.  You go somewhere like Turkey for a week, and you're the minority?  You know how you could equate it to something maybe we're all familiar with?  Go out into any major city, hail a cab, and imagine someone like Opie driving it.  Whoa!  You'd freak out, right?  You'd freak out if you saw that.  No!  You see, here's my friend.  Vinny, what's going on?  What's up, Opie?  Come on, Anthony, man.  I called to curse you out.  I'm Turkish, but you're making me laugh.  What's that?  He called because he was pissed because we were making fun of Turkey, but now he's laughing. 
[00:18:00]  Turkey's a filthy little thing.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I'm Italian, and let me tell you something.  I wouldn't eat off the streets of Italy, either.  Hey, Vinny, how could you defend a country that doesn't even allow their women out until,  I think, I don't know, two in the afternoon?  No, no, no.  Get back!  We were driving.  We'd leave the cruise ship and go on these excursions.  By the way, I should tell people that I only spent a day and a half in the fine country  of Turkey, and then we moved on to the Greek...  And it felt like how many?  About a week and a half. 
[00:18:30]  And then we moved on to the Greek islands, because people were like, why would you go  to Turkey for a week?  Yeah, unless you're smuggling dope.  Dude, I'm spending my vacation smuggling ass-load of hash back to America.  And the downside, I've got to stay in Turkey.  Hey, I was a mule.  You want to try some hash?  A mule.  Yeah.  Let's get some hash.  Well, look, here's the tip.  Vinny, seriously, we did these excursions to the Blue Mosque, I don't know, some famous  Muslim place that they worship, and I don't know.  Well, yes, there's a lot of mosques and a lot of Muslims. 
[00:19:00]  This is, I guess, a really famous one that just smelled like meat, because you weren't  allowed in there with your shoes.  Oh, so it was more pleasant smelling than the rest of Turkey?  It was brutal.  Oh, look.  Go ahead, Vinny.  Yeah, no, that island that she was talking about, it's called...  That means, like, Bird Island?  Uh, Kusadasi, whatever.  Yeah, that's fun.  That place was kind of cool.  Was it?  Yeah.  I've never been there myself, but, um...  Dude, did the people just stink?  It's all a fundamental...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I don't picture the guy that's just dressed in all that garb, and the women that 
[00:19:30]  aren't allowed out unless they're totally veiled up, or going like, you know, I could  really use a shower.  Well, I learned a couple things about Turkey, Anthony.  Yeah.  First of all, do you realize Turkey is the only country that's on two continents?  The only country that's on two continents.  It's part of Asia, and part of Europe.  And Europe.  How about that?  I also learned that Turkey is 98% Muslim.  Wow. 
[00:20:00]  98% Muslim.  And only a small percentage are the, uh, what are they, the Shiites?  Shiites.  Shiites.  Those are the hardcore Muslims that let their women out if everything's covered besides their  eyeballs.  They look like Casper.  Right.  Now, you know, we get a lot of flack in this show, uh, because how supposedly we, we treat  women and stuff with our Whipin' My Wednesday campaign.  Yeah.  Shut the F up.  Go to Turkey.  Yeah.  You ladies have a pillowcase and cut some holes. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  You look through that and shut up.  The best, though, the best, though, in Turkey, like, like Jim was saying, they're covered  except for their eyeballs, and it's 100 degrees out.  They're completely in black.  You can only see the ladies' eyes.  Right.  Okay?  The husband is walking right next to them in the latest shorts and, and shirt.  Yeah.  Just enjoy, and sandals.  Like, he's completely comfortable for the weather.  He's got, you know, like, uh, I don't know, uh, jean shorts on and a nice, you know, I  don't know, like, uh, Dallas Cowboys t-shirt. 
[00:21:00]  Cowboys.  Seriously.  Cowboys.  Seriously.  It's not even.  That is good.  It's the, it's the furthest from traditional, you know, uh, uh, you know, clothes.  Right.  And there's, and there's his wife just sweating her ass off.  Right.  Because she's completely covered.  Oh, my God.  And they bitch about how women are treated in America.  Shut up.  E-man from Jersey, first one to realize, uh, Brewer's in the studio.  Yeah, yeah.  Jim Brewer.  He heard a, uh, and said, oh, Brewer. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, this is Jim Brewer.  The coach sound effect came in handy for this bit today.  It's the only time I would use it.  How much, how much do you owe Lorne for the using it?  Right there.  You gotta toss him any cake.  Did Jim just use that on Opie and Anthony?  Cha-ching.  Cha-ching.  Turkey.  Turkey, okay.  So you had your little Turkish adventure.  Yeah, Turkey.  That was nice.  But you didn't...  Now, doesn't Turkey and Greece, they don't like one another.  They're like, we don't like one another.  Yeah, yeah.  They've been killing each other for many, many years, the Turks and the Greeks. 
[00:22:00]  Because I had a Greek friend.  Right.  And only, because every time we go to his, you know, his uncle's diner, he'd be like,  yo, man, tell the busboy, your mama's a spooky.  And he's like, mama's a spooky.  Oh, man, you understand?  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, Rob.  Yo, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Quick question, Opie.  I wanted to know if Turkish guys are as tough as French guys underwater.  Oh, really?  Well, I guess I should tell everyone I did not get into a fight on this vacation. 
[00:22:30]  No, by last vacation, Opie went on.  If you remember, he went down to, where were you?  Turks and Caicos.  Turks and Caicos.  Down in the Caribbean.  And he went to scuba diving.  And 60 feet underwater, he got in a fight with a French man who was also scuba diving.  So just to let everybody know what happened there on the last vacation, Opie got in a  sea hunt-like fight with a French guy.  You've never heard that story?  No, come on.  I've got to hear this.  We've gone over the bar.  They scuba dive. 
[00:23:00]  So we're going.  I've scuba.  I've dove a few times.  I'm nowhere near an expert or certified or anything.  Within about 10 or 12 dives.  So you feel a little comfortable in the water.  And it was this French guy's first time with his wife.  I'm on the ocean floor, only 60 feet, because you're not certified.  So they don't take you down to the bar.  Jacques Cousteau was a French man, by the way.  And he was a very good diver.  Guy dove until he was a virtual skeleton in a scuba man.  I know.  He's diving into his personality trap.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  Down into the murky depths.  My son, Philip, is duking it out with Opie.  So this French couple is descending.  Yeah.  And I'm, like, looking up, going, look at this.  He's coming right at me.  And I'm waiting for him to, you know, move out of the way.  Rod Serling used to narrate that, too, by the way.  Cousteau and the men of the Calypso getting into a brawl with Opie.  That's how we hear in the distance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how it translates to English.  Pitiful portrait of a dopey diver. 
[00:24:00]  It's, like, that low, too.  Cousteau and the men of the Calypso had to put off the dive because weather wasn't permitting.  Leonard Nimoy.  They found a break in the weather and went 60 feet under.  Leonard Nimoy was the announcer for some of those shows.  After Rod Serling died, he found it hard to narrate, yes.  Right, right, right.  And they went to Spock, I am not Spock.  So really fast, Jim, the French guy comes down, his tank nails me in the shoulder.  I have an instant reaction.  I'm pissed and I push him. 
[00:24:30]  The French man then threw down his gear and surrendered immediately.  Right.  So that's exactly how it was.  So he pushes me back.  So I'm like, all right, now we've got to fight.  All right, now we've got to fight.  He's got a space mask.  Spear gun coming off.  He's got a great thing.  All of a sudden, James Bond's a salt.  This is a true story.  So I punched him 60 feet underwater. 
[00:25:00]  But it was like a slow motion fight.  It was like a six million dollar man fight.  And then, so then I punched him.  And then I guess we just started wrestling from that point.  There was a brief struggle.  All of a sudden, red in the water and the sharks come.  Get off of me, Frenchie. 
[00:25:30]  What's that smell?  So, you know, then, you know, we're kind of like, I don't know, we're kind of wrestling  under water, rolling around a little bit.  And they had to break us off, and then we went on our dive.  And I just kept giving the guy shots as we went along.  That was the last vacation.  That's like the abbreviated version.  How long was the boat ride back? 
[00:26:00]  The good news is you didn't speak English.  So it was just us on the boat just glaring at each other like, you son of a bitch.  Wait, this guy wants to correct me.  Mike, what's up?  Good afternoon from former WAF land.  Hey, Boston area.  What's up?  Yeah, second geography lesson.  And Russia is also on two continents, Europe and Asia.  Oh, you got me.  But if you want to see filth, Anthony, you should go to Italy.  The reason Italy is shaped like a boot is because it's paved in dog bleep. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, no, I see.  You know something?  I have no ambition to go to Europe.  I really don't want to.  Like I said, if I wanted to see Europe.  I realize because you're down on the level of one of Jerry's kids.  You can't go around on your own.  You can't order a meal.  You can't read the newspaper.  You can't watch the TV.  You feel like a retard.  You know what I did when I want to go to Europe?  I do what I did.  I went to Epcot.  I went to Epcot.  I said, you know something?  I sat in the little English land place.  Awesome bar. 
[00:27:00]  I had a Guinness.  I'm sitting there having a Guinness.  Very English.  Why do I have to go to England?  Why did I?  You know what was funny, though?  A little fake animatronic car pulled up, and it was an IRA animatronic.  It was like a little fireworks show.  It blew up in front of the bar.  But everyone was fine.  Everyone was fine.  That's what I like about it.  I saw the world.  It took me about an hour and a half.  A fake Irish guy coming in, ticking.  I was wondering if I couldn't get it.  Everyone run!  Oh, God, he's ticking! 
[00:27:30]  I saw Africa.  I went right through there, and they did all the native dances right out front.  It's great.  No fear of Ebola.  No fear of somebody hacking me up with a machete.  That was fun.  I saw the world.  I bet you you didn't have explosive diarrhea like I had for four days.  No, see?  Disney is part of America.  All right.  Wait, that guy asked if I got in any fights over vacation.  Yeah.  I do have to say that the Turkish Muslims are a bunch of pussies. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, hey, hey, easy there, champ.  I was in one of their museums, an old palace that they turned into a museum, or parts of  it, I guess, are a museum now.  Yeah.  And I'm checking out all the crap, the stuff they used to wear.  I can't relate to anything.  Jewels and their old plates and stuff.  Real old crap.  Right.  It's old crap.  No, it's called relics, maybe.  Whatever.  It would mean a lot to these people.  Well, so you have to go back to, we got the music that Ant was doing. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  All right, because I walk into, I walk into one of the rooms in the museum, and it was  a pretty serious place because there was a guy in the corner with, what's the, what's  the Islamic Bible called?  Hold on, the Koran.  The Koran.  The Koran.  He's kind of singing passages from it.  That's what I'm getting at.  All right.  As I walk in, right?  Hold on, let me get the music.  Ma-ya!  Ma-ya!  Oh, come on, come on, come on. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, he doesn't want to cue up.  No, he doesn't want to walk because he just broke it.  He punched it.  It's not French.  Dan from Hoboken.  And once again, he's chiming in with his Billy Hayes in Midnight Express.  Remember that?  Where he goes, for a nation of pigs, it sure seems funny you don't eat them.  Jesus Christ forgave the bastards, but I can't.  I hate you.  I hate you.  I hate your nation.  I hate your people. 
[00:29:30]  I F your sons and daughters because they are pigs.  You're all pigs.  That was Billy Hayes' little opinion on Turkey.  All right.  What great music.  What do they do?  They'll change the station. 
[00:30:00]  Bloop, bloop.  So I walk in, and I can tell right off the bat something serious is in this room  because the music's playing and everyone's really serious.  And they're looking at this one display case.  Yeah.  So no one will let me get close because of how I look.  Because it was obviously a bunch of Muslims.  Yeah.  You don't look like the stereotypical Muslim.  So I finally get close enough to see what they're looking at.  And I swear to you, they're claiming that they have beard hair of Muhammad. 
[00:30:30]  The Muhammad, not Muhammad Ali.  The Muhammad.  Beard hair of Muhammad.  Right.  Wow.  And how is that displayed?  Like on a little thing with just hair sticking out.  Sticking up like a small hairbrush?  Yeah.  A small toothbrush type thing?  Sure.  It's his whiskers.  Not a lot, though.  Like I'm talking maybe one, maybe two hairs.  And they're all just staring like it's the most unbelievable thing ever.  So Big Mouth here. 
[00:31:00]  No, dude.  Stop.  Don't even.  I'm with Sandy, and I see the beard hair of Muhammad.  The music's playing, and then the place.  This is like Jesus' sandal or something.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I don't realize, I have this problem where I speak too loud.  Yeah.  I think it's all these years of radio I can't hear anymore.  Right.  And I go to Sandy, but loud enough pretty much for the whole room to hear, I go, what's  the big deal? 
[00:31:30]  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  It'd be like Jesus' beard hair or something.  Yeah.  What is that, cow hair?  Right.  Could you touch it?  No, no.  That was the way it was.  Yeah, I would think it'd get worn away.  It was in a, like, four by four glass case, and that was the only thing in it, in the  middle of it.  Well, they don't want you even getting close.  I'm like, what's the big deal?  No, don't touch it.  Don't even look at it.  Look, it's still got the old tagger on it.  You know what?  No, no. 
[00:32:00]  Don't even look at it.  You know, I said they're a bunch of pussies, but I think what saved my life was the fact  they didn't understand English, now that I think about it.  Yeah.  They do here.  You know what, though?  If you're looking, if you were looking to kill an American, though, and you're just looking  through a crowd, you would stand out like, bing, bing, bing, American.  Right.  You just have that look, like, if they wanted to, that's it.  Hey, man, we're just getting started.  They're telling us we've got to take a quick break.  Yeah.  Jim Brewer in the studio today.  Brewer!  This is very exciting. 
[00:32:30]  Thanks for hanging.  He's going to go on tour starting tomorrow.  Yeah.  Tomorrow.  He's doing the rock and roll comedy tour.  Are you going to Turkey?  I want you.  We're going to Istanbul, and we're going to Kenya.  Nice.  Nice.  Pick up some I-bola.  And he's going to be coming to a lot of the cities that we broadcast in.  Hell, yeah.  He's starting out on Long Island tomorrow night, and I'm hearing there's a few tickets still  available.  They're going to go really fast, so you guys are crazy.  He's playing the Vanderbilt tomorrow night on Long Island. 
[00:33:00]  Yes.  Do we have a phone number for the Vanderbilt if they want tickets real fast?  Where they go through Ticketmaster?  I can go through Ticketmaster.  You're crazy if you don't see Brewer tomorrow night.  A bunch of us are going to represent.  Yeah, we'll have some tickets to give away a little later, right?  Then we're going to get drunk and fight some Mexicans.  All right, we'll be back.  We're just getting started.  It's good to be back, man.  Yes, it is.  Anthony, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Philly, Cleveland, Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco.  The empire is spreading. 
[00:33:30]  Conquer Earth, you bastards!  Anthony Hooters, if you like hot girls in short shorts, juicy wings, great tasting beer,  head down, oh, head on down to Hooters of Wayne.  They ought to put a punctuation of some sort right there.  Great tasting beer, comma, head down to Hooters.  I think the comma's in the wrong place.  Right, of Wayne, for tomorrow's WOW sticker stop.  Go and meet the road crew for your WOW sticker and stay and have a drink with the lovely girls of Hooters of Wayne.

You'll have your WOW sticker, your tasty wings, your favorite lager,  and you'll be in good company with the chicks from Hooters of Wayne.  There you go.  So, this is a WOW sticker stop, you can't miss that.  It's tomorrow between 4 and 5 at Hooters of Wayne, located just south of the Willowbrook Mall on Route 23.  Can you think of a better place to spend Whip-Em-Out Wednesday?  Head on down.  The girls from Hooters of Wayne await you. 
[00:34:30]  It's Hooters of Wayne.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A little taste of gut smack.  There you go.  Bad magic.  Great song.  Great album.  One of my faves still.  Kim Brewer in the studio.  He's hanging with us.  He goes on tour tomorrow.  Long Island.  Long Island. 
[00:35:00]  Tomorrow night, the Vanderbilt.  We're all going.  Not many tickets available.  So, give the Vanderbilt the call or call Ticketmaster.  I think it's like an 8, 9 o'clock show tomorrow night.  Run.  No Turkish people.  Turkey?  No people from Turkey.  Yeah, yeah.  We can do that.  Let me go to the phone real fast.  Anthony, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to know if Muhammad's beard was holding up like a ball of 1,000 pounds like in Superman 4. 
[00:35:30]  You know?  Or even worse yet.  Or even worse yet.  That it smelled.  That thing, how old is that thing?  It has up to touch, wash.  It smells worse than like 17-0's tribe.  Thin ends.  You know what I'm talking about?  No, I'm sure you just...  Hey!  Jersey loves Brewer, baby!  Take it easy!  All right.  Muhammad's beard hair was...  I don't know.  It's a case.  It wasn't even...  It was this...  It was like stubble.  Yeah.  It was like two hair stubbles.  It's from what have you.  In a 4x4 case.  Shouldn't sit there and make fun of it, though, especially when you're in Turkey.  I didn't understand. 
[00:36:00]  I'm glad it was nice and secure in the 4x4 case with some dude with some drapes on it.  John, what's going on?  Hey, I gotta know.  Was the 7-Eleven zone by people from Wisconsin?  An interesting question.  Oh, but did you visit a 7-Eleven in Turkey?  And was there indeed a cheese head running it?  How you doing?  Hardly enough, you actually don't understand them.  I'll give you a Slurpee.  They're right over there.  That's funny, John. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, we got a burrito.  No 7-Elevens.  Lots of McDonald's in Istanbul.  And Pizza Hut, right?  Yeah, I did see a Pizza Hut there.  They like their pizza.  Pizza Hut and McDonald's.  Huge, yeah.  That's something.  What were you saying about Disney?  What?  That I went there.  That's where I went to vacation.  That's how I get to see my European...  Oh, that's what it was.  That's how I visit the world, Opie.  Through the magic of Epcot and Disney engineering.  I don't even have to leave the country to see exactly what you saw.  You know, there's a Moroccan place. 
[00:37:00]  That's close enough.  That's like Turkey, right?  I smelled some curry and whatnot.  That was fine.  I went to Mexico.  And, um...  Right, you sit...  You know something?  You go in the building.  It looks like you're outside at night.  They paint the ceiling like a dark blue.  There's some stars in there.  There's even a goddamn volcano cooking by a big pyramid.  And people go by in the boats, Brewer.  Yeah.  And I'm going like, why do I have to worry about having diarrhea from the water when I'm 
[00:37:30]  right here in Mexico?  And then I walk out the door.  I walk a few steps.  I'm in Paris.  Look, there's even an Eiffel Tower.  You're missing the true experience, though, Anthony.  They wipe down the, um...  The garbage pails in Disney, by the way.  The garbage pails?  They're full of garbage.  But they're clean.  I don't even know how the hell they do it.  But it's spotless clean.  Germany?  Germany.  They got that.  They got the Oktoberfest going all the time.  You don't have to...  Like, if I was going to Germany, and let's say it was March, I'd be S out of luck. 
[00:38:00]  But Oktoberfest, it didn't matter.  It didn't matter.  It was August.  It's always Oktoberfest.  It's Oktoberfest.  Hey!  It's Oktoberfest!  I just don't understand how they have, like...  There was a black guy working at the German place.  And then I saw, like, definitely a Jewish guy working in Italy.  I was like, what's that all about?  You want some Venus Nitzel?  Yeah, exactly.  We're very politically correct at Disney.  Okay. 
[00:38:30]  Sure, you went on the cruise and saw the world.  I saw the world.  The world is a carousel of gold.  I saw the world the way Disney wants it to be seen.  And I enjoyed the hell out of it.  You know, I saw the Indiana Jones stunt show there at MGM.  And one of the German soldiers, again, was a black guy.  I didn't care.  It took me right out of the whole thing that he was a German soldier.  I didn't care, though.  It was great. 
[00:39:00]  Everything clean.  I walked down their fake streets.  I don't worry about being accosted or anything like that.  It's a good time.  But no one had the moles, Anthony.  No, they put fake moles on the people that are supposed to be from Turkey.  Fake moles on their people.  Animatronic moles designed by Disney engineers to look exactly like real moles.  China?  Did you see China?  I went to China.  Big temples, Opie.  And little kids spinning plates with, like, silk scarves on sticks doing acrobatics. 
[00:39:30]  Why go to China?  Why spend how many hours on a plane to get to China, for God's sake, when I could just  two hours, I'm in Florida, bam, I'm in Disney, I might as well be in China.  And, you know, they're all cast members.  They're not employees, don't they?  And, Brewer, you said you went to Africa?  You know something?  No, the cast members.  Cast members.  I went, when I moved to Florida, I lived in Tampa, and Orlando had MGM and UFO Studios. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  So I went, wow, I'm breaking the movies.  I'm like, I got some friends.  There you go.  I got swearing my daughter.  We go driving to Orlando.  We get there, and we, you know, we're filling out applications.  There's a whole lot of people, and you're checking out the whole crew.  Right.  It's all Florida fans.  I got the whole Long Island, I'm in Florida look.  It's rocking.  I'm totally a star.  I stand out.  I'm filling out the thing.  Actor.  You're a Judas Priest concert teacher. 
[00:40:30]  Well, I write actor, I say special things you could do, you know, karate, swim, whatever  you do.  Well, dude, I'm sitting in this big room, and I swear to you, this guy comes up, and he  goes, you know, he's in a suit, and he goes, I understand you're auditioning, and I saw you  from across.  Here's who I want you to talk to.  I want you to talk to Danny, and you saw him.  Larry sent you, and I'm like, he gives me a card.  Oh, my God.  Larry sent me, right?  You're in. 
[00:41:00]  I'm in.  I'm in Paramount.  I'm working with Eddie Murphy.  Right.  Forget it.  I'm in Beverly Hills Cop Street.  You're a star.  You made it.  You got it in now.  You got it in.  Here we go.  Dude, Larry calls me in.  I'm already walking like a dick.  I'm already looking at the entire room behind me going, I wasn't even here 10 minutes.  Good night.  Losers, right?  Dick.  I get in there.  Dude, they go, well, we really need some people downstairs, some janitorial. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, no.  And or, you know, fixing the Bugs Bunny ride, whatever ride they had.  They want me to do it.  I said, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think you might have got the right ride.  Yeah.  I'm the actor guy.  I know Larry now.  It's, you know, he sent me.  And he goes, you know, I'm a cast member.  And he goes, yeah, well, all the employees are cast members.  Yeah.  I'm like, don't be a dick.  What are you talking about? 
[00:42:00]  The guy that cleans up the garbage and keeps them shiny.  Everyone has a cast member.  Cast member.  And he says where he's from on his badge.  Instead of, I can't tell you, I guarantee you, a lot of people working there went to be an actor.  And still believe they're working their way up.  That guy told me, he's like, listen, you start here.  Right.  And then you were, we have a lot of big shows coming here.  Nickelodeon's coming here next year.  Yeah.  Right, right.  It wasn't, who started out? 
[00:42:30]  I'll tell you who started out.  What's his name from The Jerk?  And Steve Martin.  Steve Martin started out working as a cast member in Disneyland, California.  And see that?  I'm sure he had to clean up and.  That's why he's still pissed.  They got me.  They got me.  Damn it.  Hey, Scott, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Welcome back, guys.  Thank you.  Hey, it's, I'm relieved to hear that black German Ed with the bullet in his head has found gainful employment in Disney World. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you said that you were surprised that the German guy was black.  Yeah, well, yeah, they had like a, they got the Indiana Jones stunt show, you know.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm watching it.  And the guy in the machine gun nest shooting at them in a German uniform.  A Nazi, not Nazi uniform, because for some reason, I remember last time I went, the truck had a swastik.  Like a flag on it.  That was gone this time.  Yeah.  Now it's like an iron cross.  They kind of took the little pieces off the swastika.  Oh, they kind of straighten it out a little bit. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, straighten that cross out.  Straighten that twisted cross out.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, straighten that out.  We've offended some people with our accuracy in German uniform.  We're getting so damn politically correct.  It's a small world after all.  Now we're going to try to adjust history.  Well, another Disney thing has been changed.  I just read this today.  Disneyland in California, the Jungle Cruise ride.  The person, the tour guide, no longer can shoot at the hippopotamus with the pistol.  Remember, the hippos would come out and go, oh, no. 
[00:44:00]  Right, right, right, right.  They shoot and go, oh, that was a close one.  We're going past these ominous looking plastic elephants.  And they got ten complaints.  Ten complaints.  How many people are in and out of Disneyland?  Right.  Ten complaints about the gun.  I don't want my kids to see a gun.  So now they don't shoot anything.  Not in the air as a one shot.  Because you might harm the plastic hippopotamus who goes under the water and bubbles come out of his head.  It kind of takes you out of things.  It's politically correct.  It is.  But, yeah, the black guy was the German guy at the machine gun nest. 
[00:44:30]  But we know a black German guy is what that guy was saying.  Oh, you're a drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head.  And he was in the German Army.  Did we play that during Worst of?  Oh, we should have.  You know, let me tell you something.  I think the German Army is a little different now than it was when the Indiana Jones stunt show was supposed to have taken place.  All right.  I don't think Adolf, you know, he'll take the old people and little Hitler youth kids.  I don't think he was taking black guys.  And the Germans, I don't think the Third Reich was going to rest on the back of the black people as far as Hitler was concerned.  Oh, I saw. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, come on.  You guys are amazing.  Hey, Steve, what's up?  Get me some schmatsen.  I wasn't going to have him, man.  Hey, I just wanted to sing an old song for Anthony.  Yeah.  Okay.  And it goes, it's a small world after all.  Get out of here.  I hope it hurts, man.  Now, you know something?  I think it was closed down.  I think they were actually phased out.  Yeah, sure.  You probably ran on it, man.  They phased out Mr. Toad's wild ride.  What can we expect from them next?  There's a lot of people that don't know that you hate that song, though.  Yeah, because the ride goes forever.  Anything cool, like, takes two seconds. 
[00:45:30]  You get on some of those coasters and stuff, you go.  Hey, I'm done.  Holy jeez, that was .3 seconds of the most fun I've ever had in my life.  It's a small world, though.  Huh.  Forever.  Forever.  Just when you think you're rounding the last turn and the little Chinese kids are . . .  And it's just the Mexican kids with the eyes painted different . . . 
[00:46:00]  in a different uniform.  Just when you think around . . .  Oh, it's Australia.  It's a world of laughter, a world of cheer.  It's a world of hope and a . . .  Hey, you're around another corner.  You're in Mexico.  You're around another one.  And it just . . .  It zigzags through this.  I swear to God, I . . .  Shut up!  It doesn't end, yeah.  But thank God.  And just in case you don't get enough of the song during the ride,  the hour-long line you stand on to get into this piece of crap,  the song's playing on the line. 
[00:46:30]  There are speakers hidden in the bushes.  Right.  While you zigzag like the cattle in and out of this line,  you're hearing that song.  I like to look at it the broke kid, though.  It looks like a retard.  Like the one kid's arm ain't working.  So it's just going . . .  Or his head is going like he's got water on the brain.  Just falling over slightly sideways.  One eye's shut.  Timmy!  I thought we'd talk about Disney in that.  I know.  It's on the broken puppet.  And another thing about Disney. 
[00:47:00]  Turn it off.  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  That was me.  Turn it off!  Yeah, that was me.  I'm trying to get it.  I'd rather hear this. 
[00:47:30]  But I did have a great time.  You know, because I like being taken care of  in that whole Disney-like harmless atmosphere  where everything's nice.  They take care of you.  The hotel room, impeccably clean and beautiful.  But they've got to do something about updating some of the stuff.  They updated Tomorrowland, thank God,  because it was like Walt's 1960 version of the future.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, look at that!  Yeah, oh, the flying rocket things.  High above.  Boy, rockets really look like that.  Walt.  Good job predicting the future.  You know, just awful.  Oh, look, airplane!  Wow!  Wow!  It's got one wing, it'll never fly!  It's, uh...  So they updated some of that stuff,  but they've got to update, like,  you go on the ridiculous rides, too,  because you run out of the cool rides to go on.  Real fast.  You find yourself on, like,  E.T.'s adventure, you know?  That's when we were in a little bike, right? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  No, you're on this big thing.  They try to make it look like a bike.  You're with 20 other people sitting on this ridiculous bike.  Big, crazy basket.  To carry E.T.'s adventure.  E.T.'s head come up.  Yeah, it's his head!  Because you've got to take him back to the planet.  Nah, you're right.  So, uh...  Wait, there is a cool thing.  You have to say your name before you go in,  because that's the end.  What the hell was that about?  E.T. says goodbye to you.  I did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that. 
[00:49:00]  That's the best part of the ride.  He didn't say goodbye to me.  I blew it.  You blew it!  You blew it!  I gave him a fake name because I was paranoid.  He was like, goodbye, Anthony.  Is that what he does?  Brewer just solved a riddle that we were wondering about all week.  Of course that's what it is.  They go, you need your passport to get on this bicycle thing  to ride through E.T. land there.  So, they go, what's your name?  And this woman, there's a line of people.  I know.  I'm like, this could really speed up if they don't ask you your goddamn name.  And she types in your name. 
[00:49:30]  But I didn't mind waiting,  because I thought they were going to send something back to the hotel,  like free booze or something.  Oh, my God.  Seriously.  Thanks for coming.  It's like, wow, if they're taking all this time to get my name,  they're going to give me something cool.  You know, if I knew that was the case,  I would have said I was Michael Hunt.  And I would have used the short version, Mike.  You're blowing it!  Because the E.T. sit there and say, goodbye, Mike.  Yeah.  Mike.  But they've got to update, because you go into this E.T. thing,  and all of a sudden it's like it's going to start with a short film.  And you look, turn to your left, please. 
[00:50:00]  Do it now or do you.  The screen, the movie starts.  Who is it?  Hi, I'm Steven Spielberg.  And I want to tell you.  No, no.  Now, that's Steven Spielberg's son.  How old is this F-in movie?  It's like little Steven Spielberg.  He's 11.  Little Stevie Spielberg.  Check out my new movie, Duel,  which will be coming out in theater, TV movie on ABC.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:30]  Awful.  Paul, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I was in Disney last week myself,  and did you notice that there was about a two-by-two effing bop where you could smoke  because they banned it in the parks?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They banned smoking.  So, you know, Epcot, it's all outdoors.  You can't just walk around smoking.  There are these painted-off areas where the dregs of society, the smokers,  has to go stand and be ridiculed by the likes of everybody else.  Hey, because let's face it, the smoke knows where to stay.  There were kids walking by pointing at me and laughing 
[00:51:00]  because I was standing in this little box.  Yeah, you have to stand in the little box and be ridiculed as you're smoking.  I saw some woman, you know, just, she was in this little box with a stroller  leaning over her baby carriage with a cigarette in her mouth  with a two-inch ash on it right over her baby.  Ma, I need more money.  That was great. 
[00:51:30]  All right, we'll break again.  All right.  We're having fun.  That E.T. ride sucks if you're a stoner and you don't know,  you didn't hear that E.T. day.  Just said my name, dude.  Dude, think about how big they are.  Why would they ask your name?  Why would they ask it?  Why would they ask it?  You tell me then.  Me and my girlfriend gave fake names.  Swear to God, I didn't know what the hell they're using this for.  I'm like, hey.  They gave me a card with a, it's got a UPC code on the back of it.  I'm looking at it going, hey.  And then I even asked her, I go, what's your number on your card? 
[00:52:00]  And I go, they're different numbers, which means they're not just pressed out one kind  of goof card.  Dude, they got our fingerprints.  They do on the card.  Holy Jesus, they do.  They must dust every card off the fingerprints.  You hold it, they got your fingerprints.  Think about this, you ever go to, when you come back for the ride, all they do is just  put you under the laser.  Meep.  Hold on.  Check it with laser.  Right.  I'm telling you, man.  It's the Disney conspiracy, man.  Let's get high and talk about the aliens. 
[00:52:30]  It's a small world after all.  Let's break.  We'll be back, though.  We're at a really good time today.  Brewer heading out.  We're going to miss him, man.  He's doing his rock and roll comedy tour.  It starts tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  A few tickets still available.  We're all going.  So give the Vanderbilt a call or Ticketmaster.  We will own the world.  Shut up, Daffy, for a punch in your penis. 
[00:53:00]  And join us tomorrow night for a rock and roll party with Mr. Brewer.  You, man.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  Hi, Anthony.  Sam Adams.  I want to start this live read by wishing Jim the best.  He was in a horrific bike accident. 
[00:53:30]  What?  Broke his wrist.  Jim Cook?  Broke a few ribs.  A motorcycle?  Hurry.  You know what's even funnier about it?  He claims he wasn't drunk, but he was in Boston on, like, the BU Bridge and just totally wiped out.  I'm wiped out.  I'm a biker, dude.  Like my great-grandfather used to say.  Wear a helmet, dumbass.  Can we get Jim Brewer to call the...  Ah, Jim Brewer.  Jim Cook to call the show today?  We've got to get him to tell a story about how he crashed his bike on the BU Bridge.  Well, you're going to love Sam Adams. 
[00:54:00]  Sam Adams.  They had a great little jam party there at the brewery.  And we'll talk to him about it if we get him on the phone.  But you'll love it.  We drink it here.  We love it.  Brewer, you love it.  I'm bringing it on tour with me.  That's right.  That's right.  My whole tour, what'd they say?  What do you want on the bus?  I said Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  The quotation for four guys on Opie and Anthony.  And Ron and Fez is the station.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:54:30]  New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Crystal Method, Anthony.  Name of the game.  Yeah.  The new CD rocks, yo.  Jim Brewer in the studio today.  Ah, yeah.  Feeling good being back from vacation, huh?  Someone has to explain to me the toilet sink. 
[00:55:00]  Toilet sink.  I was in Athens.  The only toilet sink I ever know of is when you're at the game and the urinals are too full.  And you use the sink.  Oh, should I tell my story?  All the stories.  What?  Absolutely.  This is a great Long Island story.  It was near the roller rink in...  No, in Northport.  East Northport.  There was a roller rink?  Right on 25A there.  All right.  A little further down, there was a bar that was really hopping back in the day when I was in college. 
[00:55:30]  And I was a freshman.  And me and my bud, Rob, we went out with these two girls.  That we barely knew.  This wasn't a gay friend that you mentioned on the 2020 interview, was it?  No.  No?  Okay.  Just checking.  Just checking.  We'll get into that later.  You're such a dick.  All right.  Just got to check.  No, Rob was not the gay friend.  Okay.  So, me and him, we're double dating with these girls.  And we're just slamming pictures getting hammered. 
[00:56:00]  Hammered.  Hammered.  And we are just gone.  The place is happening.  It's happy hour.  And we barely know the girls.  But we're thinking at this point, we're going to get lucky.  You're in.  Absolutely.  So, I have to get in the bathroom to go to.  Yeah.  I'm in.  We're in.  How's it going with your chick?  I'm in.  I'm already back out three times.  So, I'm like, hey, I'll be right back.  And I go to the bathroom.  And I literally stagger to the bathroom, man.  And like Anthony just said, all the urinals were taken.  I'm like, ah, screw this. 
[00:56:30]  I think it's this type of place.  So, I whip it out and sink.  Sink action.  Sure.  Bouncer catches me.  Yeah.  Grabs me by the back of my neck.  And he's got me.  And he drags me.  He goes, I go, wait, wait.  I'm here with some friends, right?  Drags me to the table where my buddy's sitting just like, just can't wait to get out of there.  We're going to get some action.  And the two girls are there.  I have to tell these three people that we just got kicked out of the bar.  And I have to tell them why.  Oh, no. 
[00:57:00]  His face is all red.  Yeah.  That'll ruin it.  Oh, end of date.  Drive us home.  Real quiet.  Drive us home.  You poor bastards.  Good story, man.  You're nuttier than I'd.  Oh, hell yeah.  We just need a little music for our next guest.  All right.  Hold on.  Our next guest.  Hold on, next guest.  We just need a little music for him before we pop down the phone line.  All right.  You never know who's going to call the radio show, Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  Let's get him.  Hey, Jim Cook.  Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  Hey, guys.  There he is.  Uh-oh.  I think I'm about to be embarrassed again.  No.  Hold on a second, Jim.  Hold on.  Your music is playing.  We're looking for adventure.  And whatever comes out of you.  Yeah.  Yeah, darling, don't make it happen.  Take the world in a loving place. 
[00:58:00]  No.  Oh, for your car.  And we're floating to space.  All right.  Let's make a night.  Hey, I'm in a thunder.  Listen.  Hurry up, Dick.  Get out of the car.  Walk it off, Dick.  Well, Jim. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  Hey, Anthony.  Now, I was just informed that you had a little bit of an accident.  Yeah.  It was one of the stupid things you do when you're sober.  And I never hurt myself drinking.  You guys know that.  No, of course not.  It's only when you're sober that you get into trouble.  That's true.  It's coming right for us.  That is true.  Now, I know you, Jim. 
[00:59:00]  You love drinking your wonderful Sam Adams.  But you have people drive around drinking Sam Adams.  Yeah, usually.  And now, you were on a motorcycle.  No, I wish it was on a motorcycle.  It was a weenie mountain bike.  No, it wasn't a real bike.  So, it was a bicycle.  It was a weenie little bicycle.  Hey, this wrecks our whole fit, Jim.  I know.  I know.  I didn't have a leather jacket.  I just had those stupid little tight pants. 
[00:59:30]  It wasn't a real helmet.  You know, it was one of those little lightweight bike helmets.  But this was an embarrassing way to break a few ribs and crack my hand.  Faggot.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  You're on a bicycle.  It looked like I was in a Cherry Hill mall or something.  Bling, bling, bling, bling.  Look out.  Bling, bling, bling, bling.  So, you're riding your bicycle. 
[01:00:00]  Walk us through what happened, Jim.  Well, you know, Boston.  I was riding around the Charles River on that bike path.  It was like 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, really early.  It was Sunday morning.  Beautiful day.  River beautiful.  And I'm riding along.  And the next thing I know, I'm on the ground.  My bike's there.  My helmet's cracked.  And I'm like, wow, I should have had a beer.  This is going to hurt pretty soon.  What have you hit?  You know, I have no idea.  I got a concussion.  Wait a minute.  You're just riding.  And then all of a sudden, you're off your bike. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  No recollection.  It was not a drug flashback.  No.  I was completely sober.  Like, I think the only thing that could happen like that is one of those little guy wires  that come down from the telephone poles.  If you hit that with your throat.  Either that or like you're just hanging in, like, you know, when your pants get stuck in  a chain.  You don't realize it also.  One of the worst kind of bicycle accidents were also.  Remember the one?  I saw a couple of girls did this years and years ago when I was a kid.  There were ride bars with her feet dangled.  The carfist gets creamed.  And the bike does the header. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, that's a bad thing.  And the bike does the header.  Yeah.  But I heard Dolly Parton was riding a bike and hit a bump and gave herself two black  eyes.  But I'm pumped.  There you go, Jim.  Stick to making me.  All right.  Now, Jim, so you're laying on the ground.  You got a concussion.  What else?  What other injuries?  I broke two ribs.  I broke my hand.  So I got a cast on.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I mean, I should stick to the drinking.  Did you have those dopey tight bicycle pants on? 
[01:01:30]  So you're just laying there with your junk just hanging out?  Yes.  It was really embarrassing when the paramedics came.  And they hauled you away?  Did they know who you were?  Yeah.  I told them when I was in the ambulance.  And the guy's, wow, can I get some free beer?  He didn't care.  I could have had paralyzed from the neck down.  Yeah.  Can I come to the brewery and pick up some beer?  Yeah.  I got audio of the emergency.  Oh, yeah.  They came upon him.  This is what they had.  Walk it off, dick. 
[01:02:00]  That's got to hurt.  It was bad.  Yeah.  I have a passerby that saw it happen.  Yeah.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Really?  This was a guy in a cab, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Man.  You are one pathetic loser.  That was not a really dignified way to break a couple of ribs.  Oh, Jesse Jackson giving him some advice.  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes! 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  I wasn't even looking for empties or anything.  No!  Don't!  Don't!  But you're feeling better, Jim?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually had a couple of beers.  I felt a lot better.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Your fine Sam Adams makes any pain go away.  It worked.  It actually worked.  I forgot about the concussion and the broken ribs.  Yeah.  And life was pretty good again.  Hey, Anthony.  I want you to bang your junk up.  No, that was okay.  You hit that curb and the back wheel just pops up and your jaw. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  Bang!  No, it hits your taint.  Oh.  Your taint.  Oh, God.  You can't even cry.  You just go...  The taint injury.  I did get him to put a bottle opener in the cast.  Oh, really?  I have a built-in bottle opener on my cast.  You can just open bottles at your cast.  Yeah, I feel like Captain Hook.  You know, I can't use my hand, but I can...  Use this bottle opener.  Come on!  That's handy.  Yeah.  Otherwise, it would have been really desperate.  I would have tried to open them in my teeth. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, we had Jim Cook right as he was crashing.  Sweet, merciful crap!  I wish.  And another ambulance worker.  What the hell were you thinking?  Oh, no.  Is this true?  I was walking right by the accident scene.  Your balls are showing.  That's awful. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, Jim.  It was completely embarrassing.  Hey, one of the brothers from Dorchester.  You got knocked the f*** out!  That was a lovely...  That was a lovely...  No, no.  No, our brewery's right by those guys.  Those guys would have helped me out.  Look at me localizing for Boston, too.  Yeah, that is very good.  All right, Jim. 
[01:04:30]  Well, I'm glad to hear...  You're okay.  Yeah, I'm delighted you guys call up with all this sympathy.  You know, next time you could just send flowers, it would be okay.  Okay.  This is how we show our love.  You know that.  Yeah.  More audio of Jim Cook after the accident.  Oh, my nose!  There you go.  Well, I'm glad you guys weren't in the ambulance.  I'm over here now!  Yeah, let me step on his nuts.  And, of course, Jim's saying... 
[01:05:00]  Ouch!  That had to hurt.  You know, I don't think he was thinking...  Clearly after the accident.  Really?  Why, Opie?  Listen to this.  I need to go pooping!  That's awful.  There's no room in those shorts.  I guess not.  You can't do that.  Well, Jim...  I think your time in the barrel is just about up, and you did pretty well.  Take care of yourself. 
[01:05:30]  Hold on, this guy wants it.  No more bicycling.  Rich, what's up?  Where's Rich?  We lost Rich.  Okay.  Did he go away?  Did you damage...  Craig wants to know...  Did you do...  Craig what?  Craig wants to know, Jim, if you damaged the basket on the front of your bike.  With the little sunflower that's curled up.  And the little...  All right.  Well, Jim, you take care.  Have a beer for us.  All right.  All right.  We wish we could have been in Boston, but we were on vacation, so... 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, you did okay.  We had a great time at the brewery.  Cool.  We didn't have Darva this year, but we did have Matt Damon.  That's cool.  So, there were some good people, but we'll bring you guys to Boston, and we'll have some  fun.  Hey, audio of Jim with a concussion in the hospital.  Yeah?  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  And...  It's really not making much sense.  Poor Jim.  Poor Jim just laying on the ground.  Oh!  Oh!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me! 
[01:06:30]  Help me!  Help me!  Hey, I got more audio of Jim right now.  Yeah, there we go.  Wow!  I need a drink!  Yeah, that makes sense.  This sobriety is not what it's cracked up to be.  Yeah.  And some of Jim's final words before being taken away.  Screw you guys!  I'm going home! 
[01:07:00]  Well, I'm glad you guys are syndicated now, and I can be humiliated across the country.  I'm delighted for that.  Jim Cook, and please, stick to brewing that fine beer of yours.  I will do my best, man.  And keep off the bicycle.  What are you bicycling for?  You're like...  You're in shape.  You're not fat or anything.  I know.  Well, I didn't have anything to do.  It was early in the morning.  I should have had a beer.  You should have had a beer.  From now on, at 6.30 on Sunday mornings, I'm opening a beer. 
[01:07:30]  Screw the exercise.  Hey, Jim, help us out.  First day of school back there in Boston at all the colleges?  Yeah.  How hot are the girls walking the streets right now?  Very nice, because the weather's warm, so they're not, like, all dressed up.  Well, we do have Jim talking to one of the young college co-eds right after he put his bicycle wear on.  So, what do you think of my tight pants?  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Wow, you were pretty cocky before the crash. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, I had a Sam Adams in my pants.  Yeah.  It was the 12-ounce long neck that I was proud of.  Hey, Jim.  Oh, an ambulance driver we have right here?  What is your major malfunction, nut nut?  Yeah, they're so friendly here, boss.  Anthony, this is really wild.  I got a cop giving Jim the business after the accident.  Really?  Because he was backing up traffic and stuff.  Marijuana is an narcotic, medically and legally. 
[01:08:30]  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm.  The last thing Jim heard before something hit him.  My head hurts.  More audio, Jim, with a concussion.  With a concussion, Anthony.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  All right, well. 
[01:09:00]  Only you guys could make a concussion funny.  Yeah.  This abuse sponsored by Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  There you go.  All right, Jim, take care of yourself, all right?  I will.  God love you guys.  I hope you have a good time on vacation.  Hold on, Jim.  I just want to play a little something for you before you go.  All right.  Show our love.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  I'm humiliated.  I'm buying a Harley tomorrow.  No!  All right.  He's taking enough of you.  He's taking enough of you.  All right, Jim.  Take care, Jim.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We look forward to your next screw-up. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  It won't be long.  There he is.  Brewer of Sam Adams, Jim Cook.  We like to call him Mr. Magoo.  Oh, my good.  Magoo, you've done it again.  Oh, eh.  Oh, eh.  I seem to have fallen on my bicycle.  Ah, Magoo.  Oh, eh.  Thank you, Jim.  Bye.  We just beat him down.  I know.  We just beat him down.  Gotta love that guy, though, man. 
[01:10:30]  Guy is, I don't know, multi-quadrillionaire with his Sam Adams.  He cooked it up in a sink years ago, and now it's a beer empire.  And he's still just a regular guy.  He's a regular poor son of a bitch crashing his bicycle.  Al, what's up?  Yes, I wanted to ask Jim who finished delivering his newspaper stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  All right.  That was funny. 
[01:11:00]  Well, when we get back to something...  Steve from Staten Island is saying they ought to make a new beer.  Slam Adams with a picture of him on his bicycle with his cast.  With his cast.  Here comes Slam!  Slam Adams.  That's great.  He should work it into his new commercials, I think.  Slam Adams.  Hi, I'm Jim Cook, brewer of Sam Adams.  Ow.  My ass hurts.  Next time, I'm just going to drink beer.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say, get off the effing bike, you tool. 
[01:11:30]  Drink a beer.  Kick your shirt off.  I was very injured, and my shoes fell off, and I lost my glasses.  Ouch.  Poor guy.  All right.  We love him.  When we get back, can someone explain the toilet sink to me?  All right.  The toilet sink.  That's what we were getting into before.  I'm not lying.  My head hurts.  He's great. 
[01:12:00]  Rick, there's the first bit for Saturday Show.  He takes the abuse well.  He sat it out.  He just sat there.  He knew he had to take it.  It doesn't matter who you are.  If you're a part of this show, you're going to spend some time in the barrel.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and trash.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:12:30]  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Hey, guys.  Real fast, just for New York.  We've got a pair of tickets to see Jim Brewer tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt as he kicks off his tour, man.  It's going to be great.  We're all going to be there.  Tickets still available, but not many.  But if you want a free pair, give us a call right now, okay?  Write to see Jim Brewer.  You know the phone number.  Anthony, WWF Smackdown.  Smackdown live on UPN tonight, Tuesday night.  Ever since Kurt Angle turned Stone Cold Steve Austin Appreciation Night into a milkomania,  the alliance leader had payback on his mind. 
[01:13:00]  That's right.  Last week, the rattlesnake exacted some revenge when he stole Kurt Angle's Olympic gold medals  and threw him into the river.  Damn you.  Well, Stone Cold Steve Austin have in store for Kurt tonight.  Find out on Smackdown live tonight on UPN.  Also, WCW champ The Rock going to be there.  What the hell is that going to be?  WCW owner Shane McMahon will do anything in his power to eliminate the biggest threat to the success of the alliance.  WCW champion The Rock, Booker T. 
[01:13:30]  Look, you know what's happening.  Tune in to Smackdown live tonight on UPN.  O.P. Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  U.P. N.E.W.  Gorillas.  Clint Eastwood and Brock.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Jim Brewer in the studio. 
[01:14:00]  We still have lots to do today.  My head hurts.  My head hurts.  That was fun talking with Jim Brewer, wasn't it?  Jim Cook.  Jim Cook.  You know what?  We always say that because he is a brewer.  He is Jim and he is a brewer.  He is Jim and a brewer.  Here is Brian.  Brian.  How did you do this?  Says on instant feedback.  I hear before Jim Cook crashed his bike he heard E.T. say his name. 
[01:14:30]  Look at that.  He's calling back to something that happened earlier in the show.  Let's get high and talk about aliens.  Well, we got a bad copy alert, Anthony.  We like to do this from time to time.  Bad copy alert.  Yeah, we do live reads for our radio show.  Yeah.  And we got some copy in front of us for the fine station that we're on in Philadelphia,  WISP.  And for a guy that we really like, Dr. Prestone. 
[01:15:00]  Dr. Prestone, of course.  You know who Dr. Prestone is, right, Ant?  Yes, I do.  He takes care of your head if you're going bald.  He takes care of your boobs if you got man boobs.  Right.  Takes care of your fat gut.  You need that sucked out.  Something tells me I think I know where this is going.  So it's a bad copy.  People think we'll just reach anything.  Now, is this from a salesperson in Philly?  Yeah, I think so.  Uh-oh.  I already know where this is going.  This could be worse than our own Lisa Orban's copy here at our own station. 
[01:15:30]  You know how some of the commercials have to have that cute little scenario before they  get into the info for the thing?  Yeah, those are the ones we call the Steve C. Homo commercials.  Right.  Yeah.  Right?  When he's hanging out at Hooters with Jimmy?  Yeah.  See, Jimmy, Steve and Jimmy are the production guys, and they put together a lot of the commercials.  Sometimes instead of just, you know, facts about Hooters, you want a cute little scenario.  Like a short little movie. 
[01:16:00]  A little docudrama.  I don't know what you call it, but it's like Steve and Jimmy sitting there going, hey,  Jim, where do you want to go for lunch?  I don't know.  How about Hooters?  Hey, I love Hooters.  You know, so you're starting to feel their character and their acting, right, Steve?  Let me pull up my shorts.  Let's get some wings.  Do you still have that Hooters thing?  Yeah, I do, actually.  Get your mouth away from that glory hole.  We're going to Hooters.  You know, like they build a little story.  Can you find it real fast?  Yeah.  Wipe that splooge up your face. 
[01:16:30]  We're going to Hooters, right?  Like your pals just hanging.  It's a must-see.  Where are you going?  He's going to get the Hooters thing.  Okay, good.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You forgot something very important about the fine doctor.  Yeah.  You can give curly hair to Asians.  No.  Well, no, he doesn't do that, but he knows a guy that does that in Asia.  Right.  Think he can hook me up?  It's because Asian guys don't have chest hair, and the Asian women love the chest hair.  They love hairy men.  Right.  So what they do is they take a transplant from the pube area and transplant curly hair to the chest. 
[01:17:00]  They could also do it down there, because if a girl likes a hairy guy, they could take hair from your scalp, where they would take a hair plug, and dump it in your groin.  Dude, scratch a couch and play with your donkey.  Come back to reality, man.  Lose some of that money.  You're bugging out.  That's what they do. 
[01:17:30]  Asian women love the hairy chest.  Anyway, so, uh, so, um...  It's a honey.  I'll buy hair, put it on chest.  The fine salesperson down there in Philly, we're going to be doing a live read for the fine doctor, Dr. Pistone.  Now, wait a minute.  I could see through this copy, kind of, and what I'm seeing is a script.  Oh, yeah.  Am I seeing a script with Opie and lines and Anthony and lines?  See, this would be a good time to tell all the new cities we don't do scripts, because they all come out really bad. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, we never do the scripted thing.  So, so the...  God, this is great.  Oh, no.  You're going to get a lot more of these.  No, no.  But we won't do any.  They can send them.  I'm going to write, because I listen to the show all the time.  Let me see.  Opie, this is totally what he would say.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what they do.  And then we'll have Rick laugh in the back.  And then Anthony will say this.  Dude, he's going to love this, and they're going to hire me. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Yeah, they're going to love this.  So the script starts with lead-in.  Lead-in.  There's a lead-in 80s music playing.  All right.  80s music.  Yo, too shy, shy.  Hush, hush, I do not.  It could be like...  Shout, shout.  La, la, la, la.  But maybe it's like 80s metal or something.  Oh, that kind of 80s.  You got another thing coming.  Late 80s. 
[01:19:00]  Maybe that's it.  All right.  What the hell?  For a goof, let's play the 80s music.  Where's the 80s music?  Yeah.  There you go.  That's cool.  Here's my line.  I got the bandana tied around my head.  All right.  Here's the 80s music playing.  All right.  If they had it their way, this would be a commercial running in Philadelphia.  Hey, Anthony, they sure knew how to rock in the 80s.  80s bands were the best, Opie. 
[01:19:30]  It was all about the hair.  Oh.  Oh.  So then they're talking about hair bands.  All right.  We need a better song.  We need a hair band.  Yeah.  You need...  You don't know what you got.  Let's go.  Cinderella.  Heartbreak Station.  No.  What?  It's still the night.  Still the night.  Still the night.  Yeah.  A little white snake would work for this.  That's a great...  Yeah.  That's a good one.  What?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Hold on. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I cut my hair off.  All right.  Hold on.  That's what's going to piss everyone...  See, now I've read it.  Oh, boy.  See, this is what's going to piss Anthony off.  It's just going to be funny.  See, she...  That's great.  You had a look.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  So, let's start the commercial again, Anthony.  Lead in, 80s music.  Let's try this.  Ah.  White snake.  There you go.  That's about the hair.  Hey, Anthony, they sure knew how to rock in the 80s.  Oh, look. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  Just had to spit the big C out of my mouth.  Yeah, 80s bands were the best, Opie.  It was all about the hair.  And here comes the line that went...  Like, what is this about?  Some of us have washed some of that hair.  Huh, Anthony?  Oh, that's cold, Opie.  What?  So, are they going from my ponytailed, under-the-hat hair to my, uh, year ago I cut off, uh, uh, my long hair? 
[01:21:00]  Hair.  That's not what it says.  No, it doesn't.  Here's the problem.  He's losing his hair.  Why is it...  He's not losing his hair.  Oh, that's cold, Opie.  And then I say, if you've lost a little hair since the 80s, it's time for you to see Dr. Gregory Bistone in Marlton, New Jersey.  Dr. Bistone's a board-certified dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon with over 20 years of clinical experience.  Hey, this is Diamond David Leroy. 
[01:21:30]  And I'm here to prove his...  Oh, hey, this is the part Tony Cattane was on the hood of the car.  This is pillow time.  This is when you get the fix going on.  This is the home of the road.  The red hair.  Jesus, man.  Let's set up a little scenario.  Who, uh, who wrote this copy?  Who wrote this copy? 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  One of the guys in Philly.  Now we must immediately find out who wrote this copy.  Let's get the...  Can we get the sales guy on the phone?  This is a losing hair in the 80s music.  Check.  Now, you know what they're going to say?  It's not you guys.  This is just, like, character thing.  But you guys do what you want with it.  It's just kind of an outline.  Holy...  I had a...  I was going to say, I was going to stop, but then I had to say, holy death. 
[01:22:30]  So, we won't be doing it this way.  Maybe we could come up with something else.  What is...  What information?  That's great.  So, there you go.  All right.  Let's move on to Wendy.  Wendy.  Hi.  Hey, what's up?  What's up with you?  Not much.  I just want to say that I'm a new listener from Boston.  Oh, cool.  And last week I was listening because...  All right.  Hold on a second. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah?  Because we've got to back up.  Because Steve found the Hooters thing.  Oh, Steve found the Hooters spot.  These are great.  All right.  Put that in there.  Yeah, this is like a great example of a little scenario, a quick little movie before you  get into the actual facts about the establishment.  You've got to relate to the people.  Oh, where do you put it?  All right.  Get in the mood.  Hey, man.  Where are you going to watch the big game this year?  I don't know.  All I do know is that the Giants are in it.  Well, then let's go someplace fun this time instead of the same old sports bar.  Dude, that's a great idea.  I know just the place, too.  Let's go to Hooters.  I go there to watch hockey games all the time. 
[01:23:30]  That's a great idea.  Love those wings and buffalo shrimp and big juicy burger.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  So gay.  How easy is that commercial?  Howdy, faggot.  I enjoy the acting myself.  Hey, dude.  We're going to go to Hooters.  Hey, that's pretty rad.  Get our Hooters.  Wow, that's extreme.  Why I order.  That's fat, yo. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, I order Budweiser.  This ain't no Budweiser.  What happened?  But one wasn't good enough.  They had to do a second.  They had to bring back the characters.  Now the characters had to come back.  This is like the sequel to the first Hooters commercial.  Oh, great.  Who doesn't love a sequel?  The big game.  The Giants.  The crowd.  What happened?  It wasn't queued up?  No, it was queued up.  It was queued up.  It was just all the data, so I was doing it really fast.  Oh, all right.  Now I screwed it up, so now we have to wait for it to queue up.  The big game.  But I did manage to put weight room sound effects and grunting in the background on the second one. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Tag.  I hear it.  The sequel to the first Hooters commercial.  The big game.  The Giants.  The crowds.  The beers.  Catch it all at Hooters.  There's no need to go to Florida in the crush of the stadium when Hooters has the best seats in town.  At Hooters, they've got all kinds of things to offer during the week.  Oh, wait.  So there's no interaction here?  Just you guys in the weight room?  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  All kinds of seafood.  Yeah.  I thought there was more interaction.  What about the beer?  They've got steak sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, shrimp, oyster roasts.  Great, great.  Seafood, sure.  But what about the beer?  Oh, and Hooters has an awesome roast beef sandwich for the biggest appetite.  What about the boobs?  Screw the beer.  It goes good with hot roast beef.  A big ice cold beer.  I almost forgot.  Now we're talking my language, and it translates to hello beer.  You can get a whole pound of King Crab for just $9.95.  Come on.  What about the beer? 
[01:25:30]  Okay, okay.  We will have some beer specials.  What do you say to that?  It's music to my ears, and my stomach is dancing the mambo.  Hey, you're not leaving?  Yeah.  Later, head over to Hooters for fun, fun, fun, and all the football action.  Or if the party's your place, please have some wings to go.  He's got cleavage all around him at Hooters, and all he cares about is the beer.  What about the beer?  And you're coming with me, right?  You're my bestest friend.  All right, here's Eric from WYSP in Philly, Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  He wrote the script for Dr. Preston.  Eric.  Eric.  Yo.  What's up, Eric?  Are you out of your effing mind, Eric?  First of all, if we send a bad copy every day, we read it on the air all day?  No, that was our first and last example.  We don't want you getting used to the fact that we'll be reading these things.  Giving commercials.  Absolutely.  You know what?  It wasn't my copy.  I'm not that bad.  Whose copy was it?  It's from the agency.  The agency.  So it's any, they just put in anyone's name, and that's the copy? 
[01:26:30]  What if the guy isn't a cue ball?  I don't know.  You know, Dr. Preston, he's a professional.  He must have seen something, Anthony, that you guys aren't seeing.  Oh, my God.  But, you know, hey, this is our first run with this.  We don't know what you guys read and don't read, but, you know.  Eric, can you come on the air with us?  We're going to get a new crab salve.  And we want you to talk about your experience with crabs and maybe some other kind of venereal 
[01:27:00]  diseases, maybe.  But I don't have crabs.  It doesn't matter.  I didn't write the copy.  We just need a guy with, you know, that could say he has crabs or something.  Actually, while I am talking, you guys, I am getting kind of a little itchy.  Is that it?  Yeah.  How about, like, anal warts?  Eric, we're going to have a guy advertise with us, and we really need your help.  Eric with anal warts is going to come on our show now and just talk about his experience  with the itching and pain of anal warts. 
[01:27:30]  You don't have anal warts?  Oh, who cares?  Don't matter.  Don't matter, Eric.  On all fours.  Jesus Christ.  As Yankee Doodle plays in the background.  They tried.  You know, Dr. Pistone, we've talked to him.  We loved him.  We did a boob contest thing, a man boob contest, where we talked about him, and then we get  sent cheesy, scripted, goes everywhere to other stations and other personality copy?  I apologize for the agent.  Awful! 
[01:28:00]  We'll send you.  We'll send you.  Well, you know, the first copy wasn't bad.  The first copy was good.  You guys read the first stuff.  That was good.  Eric, Bob's Glory Hole Central.  We're going to be doing spots for that, where, you know, where Eric gets behind the  walls and puts his mouth by the glory hole, and various men just shove their junk through,  and Eric satisfies till it's what they call happy ending.  I don't know.  You know, you're not into that, don't matter?  It's in the copy that I didn't write.  Driving that point home, aren't you? 
[01:28:30]  You said it.  They'll be driving other things home, too, through that hole.  Woo-hoo!  I got you.  All right.  You like how funny this is?  It got kind of big now.  Anyway.  Hold on, hold on.  Jim Brewer wants us.  This is the actual scene in Goodfellas, when that poor bastard in the bar goes, listen,  you're Bill here.  I don't mean to disrespect you.  You don't mean to disrespect me?  You know what?  You're writing crap about losing my hair?  You don't mean to disrespect me in front of my friend here?  Where do you get your...  I thought I told you to go F your mother. 
[01:29:00]  Bing, bang, boom, boom, boom.  Oh, my God.  He's going to go to his bosses.  Listen, guys, they put me on the radio.  What do you want me to do?  What do you want me to do?  What do you want me to do?  You got rid of them because they didn't like your script?  You're disrespecting me?  Anyway.  Anyway, we love you guys, Dan.  You're happy to have you.  Thanks, Eric.  You're not happy to have me, but we're happy to have you guys.  No, thank you, Eric.  They're just goofing.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes, Eric.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Dr. Bristone, right? 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  Say something nice about him before the show's over, though, again.  All right, please?  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  He does much better work than that copy.  Dude, I swear to God, I really thought I was in the middle...  That guy...  You guys are so funny.  You were like, so are you writing this?  He's like, I'm just saying.  I'm really driving that point home, guys.  I'd even write it.  Anthony, we change around the script a little bit.  All right.  What does it take?  Hey, Anthony.  They sure knew how to suck in the 80s. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, 80s bands were the best, Opie.  It was all about the sucking.  Some of us have lost some of their teeth, huh, Anthony?  Hey, that's cold, Opie.  Let me start out.  Let me start out.  You do the Opie, uh, the Anthony line.  I'll do the Opie line.  All right, here we go.  Hey, they sure know how to suck in the 80s, Opie.  Yeah, Anthony.  Uh, 80s bands were the best.  It was all about the sucking.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, some of us have colostomy bags now, Opie.  Whoa, hey, that's a little cold.  Hey, just cause you're crap in a sack, don't come crying to me.  I didn't write this copy.  Eric did.  What the hell is that?  What?  I loved his answer.  Well, the agency.  Yeah, the agency.  They just turned it over.  We don't care who reads it.  The agency wrote it.  They don't know who's losing their hair and who's not.  But just read the copy.  Just read it.  Who cares?  The agency.  Listen, I know I represent you, but can you just tell me to read the copy? 
[01:31:00]  That's okay.  It's not like it's TV work.  That's okay.  All right, obviously the guy's not losing his hair.  He's just doing a little bit.  It's radio.  It's a gay sex line we're advertising for.  For a gay sex.  1-900-MAN-ASS.  You want to do the spot for that?  Hey, Opie, I just love calling up and listening to hot guys talk about their man-ass.  Isolate that.  I know.  That'll be the next promo.  All right.  They sure knew how to jerk in the 80s. 
[01:31:30]  The band was all about the jerking.  That's a white snake jerking.  You know, Brewer, some people don't jerk like they used to.  No.  That's cold.  That's some cold jerk.  Hey, who's this?  Who's this?  Hey.  Hello.  All right, she's gone.  I can talk to the animals.  That's funny stuff.  Wendy.  Hi.  We have to take a break, but we want to talk to you next.  Can you hold? 
[01:32:00]  How long is that going to be?  Excuse me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay.  I'm working on my computer.  That's fine.  All right.  Cool.  Hold on.  Okay.  We'll talk to Wendy next from Boston.  Okay?  All right.  Sounds good.  Jim Brewer.  Starting his tour tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  I just started to say something about this chick, and he thought he was off the air.  She's got a good voice, right? 
[01:32:30]  She's got the voice that makes you want to go faster.  Bring out the tribal in your own.  I'm working on my computer.  Oh, you are.  You like the computer?  Sorry.  I almost broke this thing, man.  Just a few tickets available for tomorrow night as Jim kicks off his tour at the Vanderbilt  on Long Island.  A bunch of us are going.  You should, too.  Give them a call.  Get your tickets now.  Bring some Mexicans?  Yes.  Now, let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:33:00]  Afternoon radio.  This is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going to go?  Opie and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  Anthony, Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Yes.  How's that sex life?  Well, mine sucks, Anthony.  I mean, it's really good, but, you know, I have to say it sucks for this live read.  Hey.  It looked like a complete tool, and they could sell more Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  If I wasn't completely impotent, I would use Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed. 
[01:33:30]  But since I got a piece of limp linguine between my legs, I have no use for it.  It can't even help me.  I'm such a sad sack.  I might as well just chop my schlong off.  But if you still have some sensation in your schlong, unlike me.  Hey, I'm proud of you.  You read it just like you said.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Call them up 1-800-899-5323.  You're going to get, your sex life is going to get into a kick into overdrive on this one. 
[01:34:00]  You'll love it.  One couple said it made their already torrid sexual activities earth-shattering.  That's right.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Get it at GNC, the vitamin shop.  That's a fake couple.  It just sounds good for the read.  Right.  And other vitamin retailers.  Or call them up 1-800-899-5323 for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, it's the O&A Show. 
[01:34:30]  Thanks for checking us out.  Let's finally get to Wendy.  Wendy, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  I called to pay a compliment to Jim, but I might just take that back now.  Why?  Why do you think?  I heard him trying to make fun.  Oh, yeah.  Where is Jim?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not funny.  Not laughing.  But I did listen to the show.  Well, that's all right.  On Friday.  Yeah.  And I want to let you know, Jim was on that show. 
[01:35:00]  Where is he right now?  He's right here.  Okay.  Yeah.  He had me laughing so hard.  There was a bit about, you know, wives, girlfriends, finding their husbands or boyfriends.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, because I want to make sure it gets on the air.  You're talking about Jim telling the story of getting caught by his wife while he was  taking care of his own business.  I must tell you, I laughed so hard.  My eyes, I can't even tell you.  I couldn't even see driving.  Cool.  I called my husband.  I said, you have to hear this. 
[01:35:30]  Because there's a reason behind this.  Uh-oh.  It's because I have found remnants, evidence of him doing the same thing.  Remnants and evidence.  Evidence.  Now, we need to hear this because we need to hear the other side here.  Evidence.  Is Jim here now?  Yes.  Jim, hi.  Hi.  Well, what do you mean by evidence?  Like, yeah.  The sock was standing up on his own in the corner.  What happened here?  You know what?  He would so die if he knew I was there.  Good.  You got to be careful because we're very responsible broadcasters. 
[01:36:00]  Yep.  And I understand.  Even though 2020, those effing tools.  I thought.  I thought.  Well, we'll talk about it later.  We.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Do you want me to tell you?  Yeah, go.  Sorry.  Okay.  That's all right.  What evidence did you find?  Well, you know, there's certain smell.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, God.  What the hell?  Okay.  The ladies will know what I'm talking about.  Oh, wow.  There's a certain taste and smell.  I was doing a load of whites.  A load of whites.  No.  No pun intended.  I was doing a load of whites and I dropped one of the towels. 
[01:36:30]  And when I picked it up, I grabbed all the clothes to go downstairs.  Yeah.  And it was next to my face.  I'm like, what is that freaking stench?  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, and I grabbed it.  I felt like a mother finding their teenager doing something that I was supposed to.  Uh-huh.  So I talked to my husband.  I said, yes.  Wendy, can I slow you down a little bit?  Yes.  I'm kind of getting a little signal from this.  You're going to signal?  Wendy, yeah.  You know your husband, you know, takes care of himself, right? 
[01:37:00]  Correct.  I'm not stupid, but I find it appalling.  No, let me tell you something.  I don't think there is such a pungent aroma coming off of a guy just doing that and leaving  something in a towel.  What will smell bad is if he gets home from work or wherever he is, washes up or maybe  just has to wipe down with the towel because there are other things on there, not just 
[01:37:30]  his, but maybe someone else's on there.  And that's what this aroma is coming from.  No.  No, I could be wrong on that, too.  You ever leave a tuna fish can out in the sun?  No, you're definitely wrong.  Oh, right?  Definitely wrong.  So you just think he's cranking and then using the towel?  Yes.  Have you ever...  How is...  How is...  Wait a minute.  You know, I just called to compliment the show, and I didn't think it was going to go 
[01:38:00]  to this realm.  No, we kind of like this.  Don't go anywhere.  Was there...  Let me ask you this.  Jim, I hear you laughing.  Well, yeah, it's funny.  No, but his laugh is like mischievous five-year-old in the corner.  No, that's me.  That's me.  Okay.  I got the stupid laugh.  Okay.  All right.  Jim, you have a question.  I was going to say, is it...  Oh, here we go.  Is it a little stiffer there in that area...  Okay, sure.  ...than the rest of the towel?  Say again?  Is the towel...  Is it a little stiffer? 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yes.  Of course it was.  So it's like crunchy, kind of?  Yes.  Oh, then you guys know what that is.  Oh, hell.  Geez, growing up?  Yeah, of course.  So that's what I found.  I can't crank it onto anything.  This tissue don't feel like snot.  I swear to God, I was like one of those...  You see the specials on tigers when they just walk by something and mark it?  That was me.  I owned everything in the house.  So I just wanted to let you know that I could relate, and I found it very amusing. 
[01:39:00]  And the fact that you brought up that you think my husband was cheating on me, not funny.  No, I know.  And Jim, you poking fun at me, not funny.  Wait, I had something else I wanted to ask you about this whole series.  That's the only evidence you found?  Yeah, why?  It is?  So what did he say?  Because there isn't a...  He acted like a 14-year-old when you found Newtie magazine underneath their bed.  They're embarrassed.  And he's like, when do you know?  Well, let me talk to you. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, so he admitted?  Oh, yeah.  Well, of course.  He wanted to admit to one, not to...  Geez.  He'll admit to murder one, not murder two.  And what does that stuff do?  He's confident.  Do you guys want to call him?  He's confident, too.  Hey, what does that stuff do to the hairs on your leg in the shower when you think you  got it all off?  And then later on, you're like, ow!  Hell, that!  I don't know what you're talking about.  I was in the shower.  You've all washed away.  Uh, Rob, what's up? 
[01:40:00]  I just got a comment for this forward.  What?  Yeah, your comment is, uh, your husband's cheating on you.  Figure it out.  Come on.  Someone else.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Like, if it smelled bad.  Unless he's using the same towel and not washing it from him.  Oh, that's nasty.  But, uh...  What does it smell like?  Yeah, what does it smell like?  What does it smell like?  What does it smell like, guys?  All right.  Cement.  No, it smells like cement.  No, she didn't know she did.  Oh, she said the other thing?  Yeah.  It smells like a bunch of people that are in a submarine. 
[01:40:30]  Exactly.  Together.  All right.  Let's see.  You know what?  I think other women need to call in and, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's Wendy's radio show now.  Yeah, it is.  Well, I'm done now because now I'm going to go home and be like,  Are you cheating on me?  Lois.  Yeah, she's all right.  What's up?  Hey, uh, just wanted to call and tell that lady that,  speaking from experience, having to have to wipe down once or twice,  that I think she's barking up the wrong tree and he's got somebody else. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Like what?  I'm hanging up now.  No, seriously.  Just from experience, honey, your man badge doesn't smell that bad.  No, it wouldn't be something where you just, like, picked it up and then got a waft coming off of it.  Oh, I'll tell you what.  No, there's, you know, what that musk smell comes like after getting some.  Well, that's a combination of, you know, tab A and slot B.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  It's like, yeah, that'll work up a certain aroma. 
[01:41:30]  But I'm talking, if you're alone and you just crank it, the byproduct, I don't think, has any kind of,  I don't remember smelling anything.  And I spent quite a few years throwing a few batches.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Oh!  All right.  Especially if it's dried up.  Yeah.  It's a little dried up.  Excuse me.  I don't know.  Are you guys done?  Yeah.  I think it's the post-boffing wipe down. 
[01:42:00]  Do you want to call my husband?  On your towel.  We're done, and obviously your husband is.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks.  He's going to be.  All right, Wendy.  Bye.  There she goes.  A lot of people agreeing that maybe there's something else on that towel.  Maybe he had cranky ass.  Really?  Maybe he had cranky ass.  Funky, funky.  Yeah, cranky.  You know?  You don't have the cranky ass and you've got to wash it?  I hate that.  Swamp ass.  Who has swamp ass?  Swamp ass.  All right.  Look, I can finally ask this question.  I was.  Do you ever take that long dump before you've got to do 18 holes of golf? 
[01:42:30]  Do you ever take a long dump?  Dump?  Dump.  And then 18 holes of golf, the 19th hole is thick.  And your ass just be wet.  Wow.  Good fire, Dan.  And flies say, screw it.  Uh-uh.  Because flies don't even mess with their hands.  They say, screw it, Jack.  That kind of swamp ass.  Speaking of the swamp ass, so I'm in a hotel in Athens or a vacation. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, jeez, finally we got the sink store.  What is the toilet sink?  What do you mean?  It's, all right, you go in the bathroom in this hotel in Athens, and you've got the regular  toilet, and right next to it's another toilet with like a hot and cold knob.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And a little drain stop.  It's a bidet.  Yeah.  It's a bidet.  It's for cranky ass.  Clean yourself up.  Yeah, it's for swamp butt.  When your ass is wet, you'll bend it over the sink, but ain't a sink, and you turn, and 
[01:43:30]  you clean your ass.  And then your ass says, screw it.  Hey, you're supposed to.  Because flies don't even mess with the little sink, Jack.  See, you take a dump.  It didn't look like you could do that, though.  And then when you finish, you turn on the nozzle, and the water like sprays up.  I don't think it was just right on.  Did you turn it on?  It was a regular, I, I, I took care of business. 
[01:44:00]  No, you didn't use it for, come on.  You don't use that as a toilet.  Number one or two?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, when you do number two in my birthday.  It keeps me going down all slow in the flash safe.  No, see, I, I thought the bidet, the water sprays up. 
[01:44:30]  It does.  This water wasn't spraying up.  What do you mean?  It was a sink.  In the shape of a toilet.  Dope.  With a hot turn and a cold nozzle.  You turn it on.  Right?  Right.  And, and, and the water will, uh, uh, start running in it, like a sink.  Right.  But it's to clear the sides or anything, because then there's another thing, like a foot pedal  or something.  What do you fill up that sink and then, you gotta dip your air. 
[01:45:00]  You take your yam, and your chicken, and you say, skunk.  You dip it.  Well, me.  What, you fill it up and dip it?  Dip it.  Like a chip in salsa.  Like a bank chip.  You ever just say, dip it.  Well.  Dip it.  The maid got a nice surprise then.  Oh.  Because then it had, like, a drain thing, and I couldn't, like, you know, so it was kind 
[01:45:30]  of, and I couldn't, like, you know.  Oh.  It was kind of like, anticipation.  And it's just like Heinz ketchup.  And the drain just says, screw it.  Housekeeping.  Oh, my God.  Fly's been knocking on the window.  Yeah, right.  You see that?  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  Ah! 
[01:46:00]  Ah!  There's crime tape up when you get home.  And the door's knocking.  Well, there you go.  I don't know.  It wasn't a bidet.  The bidet, I thought, that sprays up.  Yeah, it does.  It's a sink.  I don't know if there's another kind where you just fill it up.  Hey, man.  Dip it.  It was just like a sink.  Give it a dip.  Where you push down the thing, and then you clog the drain, and water goes up.  Well, then, okay, maybe it's a dippy, a dipper bidet.  Dippy bidet.  Well, you dip it.  You fill up the water.  You make sure it's a nice temperature. 
[01:46:30]  What's wrong with this?  If your butt is cranky ass, you must dip it.  Bunk a bang and make.  Dip it.  Dip it good.  Dip that ass.  Dip your stanky ass.  You must dip it.  Dip it.  That cranky ass.  Bang it up.  Hold on.  You say, this guy is...  Dip it good.  Dip that ass. 
[01:47:00]  Give that ass a dip.  Give him a dip it.  Give it a dip.  Give him a dip it.  Hey, John.  John.  Bink, bink, bink.  Hey, John.  What's up, man?  John.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  That's not a bidet.  It's a foot washer.  A foot washer?  It's a foot washer.  The bidet, the water comes out the bottom.  That's what I'm saying.  It was definitely not a bidet, but why a foot washer in Athens? 
[01:47:30]  They don't wash their feet.  Do you see those corny little towels that they have that aren't really towels?  Yeah.  Those are towels.  Those aren't...  Those are to wipe your hands and your feet.  That was a foot washer?  That's a foot washer.  A foot washer?  A foot washer.  Hey, Dick.  And he's going to do number two in a foot washer.  Nice dip, Dick.  That's a foot washer.  It's a foot washer.  It's a foot...  A foot washer.  A foot washer.  What?  Let me hear him say it.  Nice. 
[01:48:00]  Nice.  Nice.  Dip that ass.  Dip the back of it.  Dip in your crack.  Dip the stanky crack.  Dip the egg.  Dip that crack.  Dip the problem comes along. 
[01:48:30]  You must dip it.  The diarrhea's on.  You must dip it.  There ain't nothing going wrong.  You must dip it.  Now move on.  Keep in shape.  Shape it up.  Get straight.  Go forward.  Move ahead.  That you get happy.  It's not too late.  Dip it.  Dip that ass.  Nice head, Dick.  When I hit my finger on.  You must dip it.  You will never let it down. 
[01:49:00]  Yes, you dip it.  I don't play it.  No one gets away.  You must dip it.  I don't play it.  Dip that ass.  Dip it good.  Boom.  You must dip it.  Boom.  Dip that clanky ass.  Dip it.  And your ass.  Blank it.  And your back.  Dip it.  Now your feet smell like ass, Hopi. 
[01:49:30]  Because you...  And you leave and you...  Rip that ass.  Smell it nice.  And you're a passing slab.  Come on.  Crank.  Dip your cranky ass.  When a problem comes along.  You must dip it.  You must dip it.  I'm so wrong.  You must dip it.  Ow.  Now whip it. 
[01:50:00]  In your shape.  Ow.  Shake it off.  Ow.  Get it straight.  Ow.  Go for it.  Move ahead.  I'm so wrong.  I'm so wrong.  I'm so wrong.  I'm so wrong.  I'm so wrong.  I'm so wrong.  I'm so wrong.  Leave it.  Whip it.  In your shape.  Shape it up.  Get that ass.  Go for it.  Move ahead.  Not too deceptive.  It's not too late.  You whip it.  You whip it good.  I don't play it. 
[01:50:30]  What you to do is bent over and walk this way.  Like this?  No, fool.  That's that ass up.  Oh, like this?  No, like this.  You're so silly.  I don't know.  I think I'm going to dump out of that.  There you go.  Well, all right.  So you took it.  Yeah, so I did the number two, but now there's like, I couldn't get the drain out, so now  there's, yeah, you can't go dig it in.  It's a little slot.  How did you not think that you, I don't know, man.  I didn't know what was going on. 
[01:51:00]  You look at a sink, and you look at a toilet.  Wasn't there toilet level?  I'm thinking toilet.  So then I fill up the toilet sink with water, and now it's, it looks like I was making  soup.  Oh, God.  It's a beef stew.  What we do is fill up the bidet with some water, and then add some excrement, and leave it marinated  for a while. 
[01:51:30]  It's a fine gravy you'll be happy to serve to anybody.  Oh, Tommy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Let me ask you, did you stay over at Hilton?  The Hilton in Athens?  No.  Yeah, no?  No.  Did you ever have any problems with a European toilet?  A European what?  I never knew there was a T, the third word.  It's a toilet.  It's a toilet.  It's a toilet.  It's a toilet.  It's a toilet.  It's a toilet.  It's a toilet. 
[01:52:00]  Excuse me.  So, you're trying to say it is a foot washer?  Yeah, it is.  Wow.  Foot washer?  Did you do any of the Athens by night?  Athens by night?  Yeah, any of the clubs, the big clubs?  No.  Yeah.  I was a wimp.  You know, they like it in the back door in Greece, Sophie.  Just thought I'd add that in, since we hadn't touched on that yet.  Wow.  I don't know.  You know, it was definitely not a bidet.  A lot of people are saying it's a foot washer.  Christina.  Foot washer.  Christina. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, you're on the radio.  Hello.  Hey.  I think it is a bidet.  I went to the Dominican Republic.  Yeah.  And you're just supposed to back up to it, and it's supposed to, like, slow.  It does go downward.  I don't know.  This was, let me make this perfectly clear.  It was a sink at toilet level.  Exactly.  Nothing different.  It was a sink at toilet level.  You're supposed to back up to it.  It didn't look like a sink.  It was a sink at toilet level.  Yeah, that's important.  Was it an ass-shaped sink, or was it round?  It was a sink toilet level that looked, you know, in the shape of a toilet. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, it's like oval.  It's a big oval wall.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you're supposed to back up to it and let it flow down.  Back down and up.  I did back up.  Obviously.  And I did let it flow.  I don't think it's a foot washer, because how are you going to get your foot in there?  I don't know.  The foot thing's starting to make sense, you know.  Maybe they'd like to have their feet nice and clean in that.  Wash your feet before praying, I'm hearing.  I don't know.  Praying? 
[01:53:30]  I like to think you wash your hands.  If it's a foot wash, then that whole dipper thing means nothing.  Frank wants to know if it had three knobs.  No, it was a toilet, hot water, cold water, boom.  You're supposed to take your foot and stick it in the dipper, but then your ass says, screw it.  Ellie.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  The only thing I have to say is I think this is another stellar example of T.C.'s equaling funny. 
[01:54:00]  I don't know.  Party equals funny.  How that works.  You know, we never intend on going there, but hey.  I was in Greece, so I figured I would do what the Greeks did.  I don't know.  There you go.  I thought that's what they did for some reason.  I thought they had it figured out.  All right.  Dude, I was in Africa when I was in eighth grade.  Yeah, get this guy.  Swear to you.  No.  Wait, eighth grade, you went to Africa? 
[01:54:30]  Yes, my mom worked for Pan Am for like 25 years.  Whoa, fly everywhere, Afri.  Exactly.  Nice.  We had one big trip.  We went to Africa, and it was on a safari.  What part?  Kenya.  Nairobi.  Kenya.  Nairobi.  Nairobi, Kenya.  And you went on a safari?  But, dude.  That's pretty cool.  No baloney.  They have these tents you stay in, and you had to leave the tent to go to the bathroom,  so you had to walk maybe about five feet of desert.  In Africa.  And I swear on my sisters behind, you would hear in the distant night, 
[01:55:00]  like fighting.  Just wild animals of Africa killing each other.  And that night, everyone told me, don't eat meat.  My sister's the only one who didn't eat meat, and she's the only one who didn't crap for five  straight days.  Well, I had a pork chop, and I should have known. 
[01:55:30]  I'm in the middle of nowhere.  Africa's version of pork.  And it looked like...  You ate the monkey chop.  I don't even think it was that.  It looked like a finger with some fatty stuff on the top.  Oh, man.  Well, I ate it, and I'm...  Dude, screw walking out.  I just unzipped the tent.  It looked like a rocket-propelled tent.  Right there for, like, hours until the next morning.  Hey, you know what?  I didn't even care for like that.  You know, I went to the...  That's funny.  African... 
[01:56:00]  I went to the African...  The Wild Animal Kingdom they got there in Disney, by the way.  And I went into one of their little quaint African restaurants.  Yeah.  I had a burger.  It was great, too.  Tasted just like the one I had in...  McDonald's?  In the Italian version of Disney.  It was great, though.  I didn't have to worry about the pork chop finger fat thing there, champ.  And I saw lions.  I saw giraffes.  Dude, I had to get shots.  I think malaria shots were...  Really?  Like, four shots.  They don't do that at Disney. 
[01:56:30]  Shots, no.  Kind of takes you out of the reality of it.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, you guys wanted to talk about swamp ass earlier.  I have the perfect swamp ass prevention system.  I'm thinking about patenting it.  What's that?  Every summer, as soon as it starts to get swamp, you got to get in the shower and get some shampoo.  I like to use something with a conditioner.  Unless you're using powder.  It's impossible.  Right.  I lived in Florida for a couple of years.  I had to hang up on it because we're responsible broadcasters, even though 2020 Downtown doesn't think so.  Right. 
[01:57:00]  We understand what the FCC is all about, you tools.  Well, he was trying to describe prevention for cranking.  A little too descriptive and probable.  He said shampoo with a conditioner.  Something like PERT?  PERT?  Is that what he's saying?  Maybe a shampoo and conditioner kind of thing?  Would that even work?  Something in that area.  I think once you leave the house and sweat starts falling down your crack, you know.  A hundred degrees outside, your ass just says screw it and stripping, and your feet say, I need to go pooping, so screw it. 
[01:57:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, hello.  Hey, what's up, Mike?  You were 80% right.  I lived in Greece for 10 years.  Come on.  Help me out.  Okay.  You don't actually take a dump in the thing.  Right.  You fill it up with water.  You grab a towel, and that's why the soap is there, too.  You literally knock it again like you're in the shower.  Ah.  Wait.  What?  I could totally see this.  You get done, right?  You could do that in the shower. 
[01:58:00]  No.  No.  Yeah, but you don't want to jump in the shower.  You don't jump in the shower after every time.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  We're getting here.  Hold on.  I missed what you said.  There are times I'll take two or three showers a day because I have one of those.  Oh, dude, there's a red alert time where you just go, oh, my God.  I've passed the point.  Now I must go from bowl to shower.  Yeah, there's nothing.  There is that.  Where you're thinking in your head, there's just not enough toilet paper in the house.  They ain't going to clean up.  You need that crime scene cleaning crew to come in.  They're just vacuuming. 
[01:58:30]  Give me some wetness.  There's brains on the walls, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Why are you taking a shower?  Don't worry about it.  Let's just hell.  Right.  Why are there flies on the window?  Go inside.  Yeah, you know you're getting in the shower when you have to ask yourself everything you turn around.  How did it even get there on the seat?  How did it get there?  How did it get on my neighbor's dog?  It defies gravity.  It defies any logic. 
[01:59:00]  How did it get there?  Famous line.  It looks like you rode your 10-speed bike through a mud puddle.  Through a mud puddle.  You ever do that with no fender on the back?  You get that long stripe right up the back of your head?  You put your legs up as you go through it?  It's all up in here now.  You've got to clean up.  So 85% right, Mike?  85%.  So you don't have to shower again when you take a real swampy one.  Okay.  All right?  I wish I knew that.  I don't think I left the mate a big enough tip. 
[01:59:30]  Have we talked about duty long enough?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, you know something?  You'll always get the, you know, why were you just talking about that, about duty?  But, you know, these things have to be discussed sometimes.  How the hell, where did that toilet come from?  What does it do?  I agree with the guy, though, that it's for washing afterwards.  Okay.  Was it the same level as a toilet?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, then it's meant for that.  If it was a foot bath, it would be lower.  If it was for your face, it would be higher.  At first, I thought it was that old SNL bit, the his and her toilets, that fake commercial 
[02:00:00]  for the his and her toilets.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  With those Victoria Jackson and one of the only funny things Kevin Yellen ever did, yeah.  Ah, there we go.  Ouch.  That's got to hurt.  Let me think.  Yep, you're right.  Hey, it's Big Al. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, Big Al.  Big Al, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, man, I've got to say something to you.  When you guys first took over the evening ride home, I was a bit concerned.  Doubt's are long gone.  Y'all just foul, man.  Oh, thank you.  And that thing y'all did last Friday that has been?  Yeah.  Man, y'all going straight to hell.  Right on.  And you've got to do it more often.  Well, keep that between you and I, and we will.  We don't want to let that bit out too much there.  Let's do it, man.  I'm calling from D.C., man.  Keep it real.  Oh, thanks, Big Al.  Peace. 
[02:01:00]  Man, the, um...  Dude, I lost it last week with the blind...  The blind boxing?  I didn't hear that the first go-round.  Yeah.  I haven't laughed that hard since yesterday.  Blind guys beating the crap out of themselves.  Always funny.  All right, we have to take a break.  Sorry, how'd you say that?  Oh, we do?  This is an outrage.  Yeah.  Wow, there's some great phone calls, though.  Yeah.  Jim Brewer.  I'm going to say it every break, because I hope people go see Jim Brewer tomorrow night  at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  A few tickets available.  We're going there to party.  It's the kickoff of his huge rock comedy tour. 
[02:01:30]  Rock comedy tour.  And he's going to be in a lot of the cities we broadcast in, so if you're listening in  Cleveland or Columbus or any of these places, you know, how are we going to let him know?  You got the website?  The website?  It's JimBrewer, B-R-E-U-E-R.com.  Right on.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  I'm looking for toilet training books.  Everybody poops is still the standard of pooping.  We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You.  See, what can't we?  So, uh... 
[02:02:00]  Oh, then you want your anomaly child, and that's committed evil coming out the back of you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I need to go poopies!  Ah, Anthony, O2Go.  O2Go.  It's oxygenated, distilled drinking water.  It's pure.  It's got more oxygen in it.  Great taste.  No aftertaste.  You know, when they distill water open, usually it doesn't taste good.  But it's very good for you.  But then, when they oxygenate it, ah, there's where you get the refreshing taste. 
[02:02:30]  And it's healthier than anything on the planet.  O2Go has set purity standards against which all other waters will be measured.  Not even nature can make this.  Hey, you want to keep going and stay healthy?  Look for O2Go, original blue.  Delicious calorie-free essence flavors, exclusive black sports bottle, and even more oxygen when you need it. 
[02:03:00]  I love oxygen, Brewer.  It's amongst my favorite of gas.  Oxygen.  O2Go.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, this is the O&A show.  Jim Brewer hanging today.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, bro.  Welcome back.  Thank you. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, I got a question for Brewer.  Yeah.  Hey, when you go on tour, A, are you coming to New Jersey?  And B, are you going to be doing some of that Rob Halford stuff?  I start off with the Halford stuff.  Nice.  Probably the best.  I shouldn't say, but the concert starts, you know, it's just like the 80s metal concerts.  The lights go out.  It's like, oh my God, here they come.  And you're going to see a picture of me over a big screen going to see Ronnie James Dio.  Oh, no.  When I was 17.  I think it's on my website. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, man.  I have spandex pants, the studded belt, Judas Priest tank top in front of my Buick Skyhawk with my snapping head.  You are so metal.  Nice mullet, dick.  Yeah, so it's going to, but right now I'm not in Jersey.  I have a mullet, man.  The mullet.  That was required if you lived on Long Island, man.  I had to have a mullet.  Everyone has the mullet haircut.  You'll see.  Right now I'm not in Jersey, but I'll be at Irving Plaza, which is.  Close enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just got a new Halford CD, and whenever I hear him hit the notes, I just think of you. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, he's unbelievable.  He's going, ah!  It's like, wow.  Dude, I just saw the MTV.  You guys, only Priest fans will really know this.  MTV, this is how I really get into Priest.  They showed a concert of Judas Priest, like in 1993, and they showed it every other weekend on MTV.  And it was just, I mean, this guy was an animal.  Ah!  No!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:05:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Like, oh my God!  Ah!  I mean, are you kidding me?  Yeah.  First video I saw was the free world burning video.  Free will burn her!  Free will burn her!  Free will burn her!  Free will burn her!  Free will burn her!  Free will burn her!  No!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, dude.  Ah!  Talking about knocking the crap out of my room.  Yeah!  Woo!  We're all going tomorrow night.  We can't wait.  We're going to have a...  Yeah! 
[02:05:30]  Check out Brewer tomorrow at the Vanderbilt.  Give a big shout out!  Big metal!  Later!  All right, Mike.  Cool.  Lady Di.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing, guys?  Welcome back to New York.  How was your vacation?  Can I go back to Athens?  No, you can't.  Oh.  How you doing, Mr. Brewer?  I'm doing good.  How are you?  That's good.  That's good.  We're going to check you guys out in the Irving Plaza, probably.  Excellent.  Marion and I, welcome you guys.  Thank you.  Finally.  Marion and I, welcome. 
[02:06:00]  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  I called before, but I was just on her too long time.  I know.  I was like...  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I'm going down far.  You know, she said before we went on vacation, she goes,  I'm going to be down far later in the month.  I'm like, when?  Oh, my God.  When?  I can only imagine that.  She looked like one of the Disney characters in the suit, even when she's not in the suit. 
[02:06:30]  What the hell, character?  What cartoon are you from?  She's from Dr. Seussland.  Hi, how are you?  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I'm staying at the hard rock.  She's got the baldness body down here.  Yeah.  Please keep your hands and feet in the...  Oh, my God.  Hi.  I can't pull the safety bar down over my tremendous saggy boot.  I'm sorry.  You can't ride this. 
[02:07:00]  You're too short to ride, but if you roll through sideways, you're tall enough.  Oh, it's that hard.  I got full of a kind of brain.  Oh, it's that hard.  I don't even know what she looks like, and I can't take out that vision.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Last time you're here, we'll make sure they stop by for a visit.  Picture McDonald's The Grimace with a dandelion on its head.  Yeah, she's shaped like The Grimace.  It's great.  I'm shaped like The Grimace.  Like the Dr. Seuss characters?  Yeah, she does.  She looks like the Dr. Seuss characters. 
[02:07:30]  They're going to be crazy.  Yeah, the big bulbous kind of thing.  That's okay.  I got that.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Kids running up to her at Disney, trying to pictures next to her.  Why does everyone want to take pictures of her?  They think you're a character.  They think you're some bizarre, forgotten Disney character.  Something from one of Walt's LSD trips.  My God, that animatronic's getting real.  They're getting really...  They're getting great at doing that, aren't they? 
[02:08:00]  Because that can't possibly be human.  But look how it moves.  I got to become a surprise.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Man, I need a nap.  You need a napski?  Hey, man.  This has been too much fun.  I got to drive out to the island tonight.  This sucks.  Hey, I stood where Socrates stood.  When you were in Greece?  In Athens.  Dude, I was right where Socrates was. 
[02:08:30]  Wait for it.  We go up there, man.  Try this.  I checked out the Parthenon.  Yeah.  Is it called the Parthenon?  The Parthenon.  Yes.  Isn't there also the Panthenon?  I can name that in two beats.  Sorry, man.  I wasn't paying attention.  At the Acropolis?  At the Acropolis.  Where Yanni played?  Yanni played the Acropolis?  Faggy?  Opie was a Yanni.  Oh, you know things. 
[02:09:00]  What?  You know Yanni?  You're better than us?  Yeah, go listen to Yanni, faggot.  Grow his hair like him, too.  Freaking Henning, whatever that faggot's name.  The world of magic.  So I checked out the Parthenon?  Yeah.  And realized that America just doesn't have any history whatsoever.  We got 200 and some odd years of history.  Wow.  Parthenon was completed in like 2 B.C.  Dude.  Yeah, it's old.  Right?  I went to England and realized.  I advise, though, if you do go to Athens, don't smoke dope before you see the Parthenon. 
[02:09:30]  It'll freak you out.  Really?  Just, you know, think about how old things really are, man.  Oh, man.  Like, whoa, dude.  Yeah, here in the States, you know, you go around and think about it.  This is the Alamo.  It's the Alamo, man.  And, you know, built in the 1800s or something.  You're like, all right, 1800s.  Wow, that's a long time ago.  Yeah.  You know, but then you realize there are people still alive that could have, at some point  in their life, shaken hands with someone that was alive back then. 
[02:10:00]  Right, right.  Where you have a 100-year-old guy holding a baby, and if that baby is now old, here's  your 1800s, right there.  Over here, yeah.  You know, like, Grandma was born in 1820.  She was born in 18?  Yeah, yeah.  18-something.  18 of 1924.  Dude, that's a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot.  You know, we say, ooh, we look, there's the spirit of St. Louis.  Dude, his grandmother is 225 in the 1800s.  And then his brother was in the Civil War.  Beat that, dick.  Yeah, you know, there's some, so you could still kind of almost relate to those people, 
[02:10:30]  those little house on the prairie type people.  Yeah.  But then, you're looking at, you're checking out the Parthenon.  3 BC.  You check out the Parthenon, and you get that same feeling the first time you realize you  were going to die.  Oh, no.  Not that one.  That's a bad hike.  Oh, no.  It's like, this was what?  Completed in 2 BC.  And then they have, and they're still there, yeah.  And they're trying to put it back together, so they have a pile of rocks that just look 
[02:11:00]  like a pile of rocks.  They're like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  They're organized.  They know where each rock's going to go.  That's like a puzzle that sits on someone's table and never gets done.  It's been there for thousands of years.  And they got pieces left.  It's like, ah, screw it.  They got them all labeled.  Then you look at it, and it's like, no, this is just a pile of rocks.  No, they organize.  Do the edges first.  It's easier if you do all the edges first.  An archaeologist won a Pulitzer Prize for organizing those rocks.  Oh, yeah.  It's a pile of rocks.  Organizing rocks.  Fell off the mountain.  Get over it, dick. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Puzz 3D.  It's a Puzz 3D.  So near the Parthenon is another little hill where Socrates took his students.  Socrates.  Socrates.  Socrates.  Yeah.  Socrates.  You know, he was who?  Socrates.  Think about what he said.  I thought you were talking about Socrates.  Socrates.  He was the guy, you know, the wisdom guy.  Right.  Sat all the people down and, like, taught him, and they all were those togas.  He taught him about ladybugs, man. 
[02:12:00]  So the Socrates hill, like, you know, it overlooks the whole city of Athens.  Bitch.  And he used to teach his wisdom to his students.  Yeah.  Know what it's used for today?  What?  If the locals go there to check out the sunset and smoke dope, I'm sure Socrates would be  happy.  Right?  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I'm contemplating.  Smoke weed every day.  I'm contemplating the writings of Socrates.  Dude, give me the joint.  Look at the view.  Check out the Parthenon. 
[02:12:30]  Dude, it was built a long time ago.  Think about it.  We're, like, doing a new year.  Oh, dude.  Oh, did you think about it too much?  Oh, yeah.  We're, like, 11 in earth years.  If you had a time scale that was as long as, like, a ruler, and that's how long, like,  the Parthenon was around, you would be, like, not even a centimeter on the metric scale.  Well, that's a metric ruler, dude.  I'm talking regular standard ruler.  Turn your ruler around, dick. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, okay.  He's right.  He's got a point.  Wait a minute.  But how much is, like, an eighth of an inch?  Metrics are another shot.  How much is an eighth of an inch?  It's, like, this much.  On the ruler, dick.  And that's exactly how you know what, man.  Hey, shut up.  Besides, you know what.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Bro, you're a pisser, man.  Oh, but I got to tell you, I did the same thing. 
[02:13:30]  I was in Athens, and my girlfriend and I got so stoned.  Yeah.  And they were telling us about the hill right next to the Parthenon.  Yeah.  And they're, like, oh, yeah, you know, that's where Socrates took his students.  Like, yeah, probably hang them.  It was a good view up there.  The place is great.  All right.  Dude, let me ask you.  What were you thinking when your stuff wasn't going to fit through that slot in the sink?  Oh, man.  I needed, like, a thing to kind of work it through.  If you knew it wasn't going to fit through, what are you trying for, dude? 
[02:14:00]  I was in Greece.  I figured it's something they'd...  I don't know.  Tradition.  Right.  Tradition.  Saget.  All right, Chris.  Saget.  See you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  What's that?  Oh, cool.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, Ope.  What is that?  You know that organized pile of rocks you saw there?  Yeah.  Yo, I was there seven years ago on my honeymoon, and I saw that same exact pile of rocks.  Did you really?  Seven friggin' years ago, and they're supposed to be rebuilding it. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, seven years in the course of 2,000 years is nothing.  Yeah, it's not rock.  They're just getting started, yo.  And, Ope, did you experience those archaeological digs, like, in the middle of the street?  There's stuff everywhere, yeah.  Dude, if you buy a piece of property there, and you're building, and you find, like, a clay pot,  the government takes over your friggin' property.  Oh, really?  It's an archaeological dig.  See, people think, like, Athens just pretty much has a part...  There's ruins all over the place.  I know, they're everywhere. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  We must take your house now, Dr. Jones.  Check it out.  I found the stick.  Ow!  Ow!  Don't hit me, dick.  What the...  Yo!  Chill!  You'll come with us.  Shorty, chow-chee!  Rich, what's up?  Oh, nothing much.  I went to the Acropolis a little while, like, about a year ago at my school.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, there's nothing funnier than seeing a group of about 30, 40 college kids 
[02:15:30]  going up there.  Just big.  Shoned as hell.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  It must have been the biggest experience of my life.  I was going up there, and all we could talk about was how hairy the women's legs were that  were there.  Paul, yeah.  How about that?  Paul, let me tell you something.  You brought up something I wanted to mention today.  That's right.  The women in Europe have got to start shaving their legs and their arms, their armpits.  Oh, no, two ways about it.  I went on some of those excursions where you're in, like, 100-degree heat, you get  back on the bus, and the women, they're not shy. 
[02:16:00]  They'll just change their clothes in front of you, which is nice.  It smells like when you know in the part of the zoo.  But they had just the long, sweaty armpit hair.  Ugh.  You know when you know you're coming close to the gorilla stage?  They do, right.  Oh, man.  That smells.  Yeah.  That smells.  All right, Rich.  You know, Opie, when I was taking my world tour through Disney's Epcot on my vacation,  because I didn't go to Greece or Turkey like you did. 
[02:16:30]  I like the clean version, the Disney version of the world.  The girls all shaved there.  All the cast members, regardless of what country in Epcot they worked in, all clean-shaven.  And once again, they didn't have those big, unusual molds.  Not the big Turkish mold.  No, I didn't see anything like that.  What's in the drinking water that everyone in Turkey has an unusual mold?  I saw one mold.  With white floods.  I swear to you, and this is going to gross someone out.  I love it.  I saw a mold on, it was actually Greece. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  In the middle of a girl's chest that looked like a raspberry sticking out of her chest.  Wow, right out of the middle.  Just nice.  As big as a raspberry, too.  I'd be so scared of that, I'd just pop her in a snowbox.  I'm sorry.  No, there was nothing like that at the Disney Epcot Center, where all the countries of the  world are represented in a clean fashion, not in a diseased, filth-ridden, impoverished  way like it is in the real world.  It's the Disney way. 
[02:17:30]  And it's very politically correct.  And you didn't have explosive diarrhea.  No.  The only, you know something, I did find something a little amiss, though, with part of my Disney  experience, MGM.  Went to the MGM Studios, which I don't really think they filmed movies there, to tell you  the truth.  Like, the MGM Studio Tour.  Way to go, Einstein.  Two seconds.  They show you one house.  Here's their big selling point.  In 1981, the first Ernest Goes Somewhere movie was filmed, and that was the house. 
[02:18:00]  Used right there on the MGM Studios lot.  Wow.  What were you expecting, man?  I don't know.  Show me the cycle house like they have in the Universal thing.  Right, Rick?  They didn't have it?  Rick was a tour guide in Universal Studios, California.  Dude, I was on Socrates' hill, man.  I've got a great time.  And let me tell you something.  I stood where Socrates stood.  I stood where Disney planned on taking a lot of people's money.  And they had a Pearl Harbor thing going on. 
[02:18:30]  A little exhibit where there's a big tank of water, some explosives in it, a ship, and  they show how some of the effects for the movie Pearl Harbor were made.  Yeah, right.  No CGI.  I know it was CGI.  They didn't have some dopes there with a boat rocking and some water being thrown on  them like some McHale's Navy outtake.  Do they have a box of gravel that, you know, you stand in to make the rug sound?  Yeah.  So this is what got me, though.  The woman doing the tour?  Japanese.  I mean, couldn't understand a word she's saying in Japanese. 
[02:19:00]  She's telling us how Pearl Harbor, how the movie's made.  Now, when the ship are here, now we're air cannon, we will show how we make the effect  when we bomb your round-eye asses at Pearl Harbor.  Now, they'll use air cannon, explosives, and fire to make planes to strafing run at your  pitiful Navy.  And I'm looking like she's, she's, they should not have a Japanese woman doing this. 
[02:19:30]  She didn't sound like a munchkin?  Yeah, she did.  Japanese, old Japanese ladies, when they're giggling and telling jokes, sound like munchkins.  And I'm giving much credit here because I couldn't understand what she was saying.  She'd be like,  Oh, boat?  Did I hear boat?  What?  Did you just say we kicked your ass at Pearl Harbor?  Did you get caught up in one of those group tours or something for the Japanese people 
[02:20:00]  or something?  No, you know what it is?  They take you, they trick you.  They trick you with these parks sometimes.  You get online and you think you're going on a ride, and then they show you demonstrations  and films and juggling and whatever the hell before you ever get to the ride.  It's a clever ruse, but at least it's clean.  We're trained, though.  We see a line.  We've got to get to...  We'll be going up the tower.  We've got to get to the back of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Any second now.  Oh, we stand on a line, and then they trick you with the line, too.  You get in, and you're like,  Oh, this is a breeze, man.  I'm in. 
[02:20:30]  There's no one standing.  You're around the corner.  Four rows.  Four rows.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Same person.  Same person going by.  Another 20 minutes.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Hey.  Do the clenched mouth thing and nod the head at him again.  The only thing that keeps that going is a great behind.  Oh, yeah.  And then you can look.  Yeah, but I'm blind, and you'll see a great behind.  It's eight hours, but you say, screw it.  Okay.  Upstate Brett checking in. 
[02:21:00]  Yes, I was impressed by the Golden Girls exterior house that they also had on the MGM studios lot.  And Rick, do you remember anything about it?  Well, that was you.  Rick was universal.  No, that was MGM.  I'm universal, my friend.  Yeah.  Rick was universal when they were in.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you now look to your left, you'll see a familiar-looking house.  Did I hear?  Yes, that's right.  It is the house of the Cleavers, Beaver, Wally Cleaver, Ward, and, of course, his wife, Mrs. Cleaver. 
[02:21:30]  And you remember all the fun they would have inside that house.  But as we drive around, you'll notice this was just for the exteriors, the front yacht.  As we drive around back, you'll see it's just empty.  The front propped up with the various lumber.  This is what they call a facade or false front in the business.  Now me, Rick Delgado, or Matt Max, as you might know me, from my radio days in Florida. 
[02:22:00]  You are such a douchebag.  We'll take you on the rest of the tour.  And let's look at the psycho house, which is actually one-third scale.  But they use a technique called forced perspective to bring it to size.  We're not really allowing you to get close.  Could someone shoot me in the head?  Yeah, like right now.  We're now going to go through the prop warehouse where I could take a nap.  It's Lucy's tampon.  This is great.  Lucille Ball. 
[02:22:30]  Doug.  Yo, what's up?  Hey, Doug.  This trip sounds far too intelligent for you, Opie.  My trip?  Yeah.  I was in Turkey and the Greek islands.  Let me ask you one question.  In which shop did you use to take a dump in the eyewash machine, too?  Take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  Let me go to Gay Marco.  Hey, I've been waiting two hours to hear about your gay friend.  You are one of my gay friends, Marco.  That I refer to on the 2020 Downtown piece. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, really?  What's up, Marco?  Hey, welcome back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to go on my vacation.  What was your vacation?  I know.  I'm getting ready to go.  I'm leaving in two days.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  To Gay Paris.  Gay Paris.  You're going to Paris?  Yes.  Wonderful.  Or, man, it might have sound fabulous.  Fabulous.  My new boyfriend, Greg from Salem, Massachusetts, is taking me. 
[02:23:30]  Wait.  We hooked you up with him.  No.  This is the one I met when I was on vacation in Provincel.  Oh, he's taking you to Paris?  In front of the shop.  Yes.  What did you do to him to rate a trip to Paris?  Look.  Everything.  Left something in a rag.  Did he treat you like the tunnel?  You know that.  The tunnel, right?  Oh, come on, okay.  It goes from England to France.  The tunnel. 
[02:24:00]  Uh-huh.  Marco and friends.  Oui, oui.  Marco, come here.  Come with me to the Eiffel Tower and I fool you up with this.  Okay, Marco.  Well, are we going to hear about this?  What?  What?  I think we all have a gay friend, right? 
[02:24:30]  Well, what did you say?  Did you talk about me in depth?  No.  Oh, God.  All right.  We got to go.  I had one gay friend.  Okay, bye.  Bye, Marco.  Hey, Marco.  Hey, Marco.  Hey, Marco.  Hey, when you saw the Acropolis, did it end with you going through the gift shop?  Did it?  Because that's how all of my attractions at Disney ended.  When I go into Mexico to get some Mexican food, as I leave, somehow I'm in a Mexican gift 
[02:25:00]  shop.  Every ride, you know?  Yeah, I'm on Space Mountain.  All of a sudden, it's a Space Mountain gift shop.  They had a whole different scam going on in the Greek islands and Turkey.  Yeah.  The hair.  Right.  You'd go on these excursions, you know, it's in ruins and crap.  Yeah.  And there would always be a tour guide that said, oh, before we get to the ancient city  of Ephesus, but, no, no, before you get there, what?  We will be stopping at Blah Blah's Jewelry Shop. 
[02:25:30]  They make the best jewelry on the island.  There you go.  And it's just a jewelry store.  The guy's getting some money under the table to bring hot in a jewelry store.  You could go there anywhere.  Right.  That's all they have in Turkey is jewelry stores.  Jewelry store.  You stop already.  But I want a jewelry store, dummy.  Shut up.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Oh, we should do the Robert Plant thing. 
[02:26:00]  Huh?  You're leaving us?  Yeah, I get half.  Oh, no.  Thank you, guys.  Well, thanks for letting me hang, man.  Taking off, man.  Thanks for letting me hang.  But, um, I thought we were all just having fun and just kind of...  We are just having fun.  He does this every time, bro.  What a weenie head.  Talk about peer pressure.  Go ahead.  Flat leaver.  You're a flat leaver, dick.  What?  Keg's empty, so now you're leaving, right?  I can only afford one keg. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, hey, Flynn.  You drank all the good beer, now you left Meister Brown in the fridge.  He takes back and leaves.  What a dick.  You go to those high school parties and then the kid only had one keg.  He's like, ah, keg's done.  Let's move on.  Spent.  Time's in.  It's 10 o'clock and we'll go home.  Let's go to the park and get a beer ball.  What's up?  What's up?  Dude, what's up?  All right, so you're leaving us.  Let's do it.  That's all right.  Hey, if you got to go, you got to go.  Wow.  Wow.  You are such a tool, man. 
[02:27:00]  It's such a tool.  Next thing you know, it's going to be like, well, what time are you going to be there?  Seven.  Dude, you're going to be late anyway.  Right.  Yeah.  You got to be at the Vanderbilt?  You think you're going to make it?  You're going to get out of that tunnel traffic.  You won't be there at nine.  Call everyone and tell me you won't be there at nine.  Fine.  Fine, leave.  You suck.  Give me a D-I-C-K.  Give me a D-I-C-K. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, it is rough.  Oh, Brewer, you know we're kidding.  Thank you for coming by.  I'll call up.  We'll do the rest.  We'll be like chicks.  You know when you first start dating that really quick and you go to bed, but you're  still on the phone.  You had to leave her house, but now you're on the phone going, so what are you doing?  She's laying out of bed.  Just thinking about you.  I go in my car and I'm like, hey, old man, what's going on?  No, I'm just driving.  We're talking about Athens or something?  Fast forward like three years and you're living with the girl. 
[02:28:00]  Turn off the TV.  I'm trying to sleep.  I'm going out.  You know what I did?  I got in so much trouble once in high school.  I was going out with this girl and she started getting pissed at me that I didn't call her  enough and like give her enough time on the phone.  So she calls me up to bitch me out about this.  I was like smoking pot all day.  I'm exhausted, tired.  I lay down on the bed with the phone next to me and I'm listening to her talk. 
[02:28:30]  I fell asleep.  Started snoring.  And she, I don't know what I did, but she was calling me to tell me I don't pay enough  attention to her on the phone and I fell asleep.  I wake up.  I wake up to that sound that the phone makes when it's been off the hook for like a year.  I got drool.  I've been asleep for a while, man.  I've been out.  And then, but for a second, I'm thinking like, why am I laying here?  Why is the phone here?  And then it all came together like, oh my God, I'm on the phone.  It's the best thing you could have done. 
[02:29:00]  It's the best thing you could have done.  You got out clean and easy.  I know those chicks.  That's my sister.  They talk just for the sake of talking.  Just for the sake of talking.  Yeah.  And they have too much time to think about what they're going to say to you.  So they're well prepared.  And you're just tired of them.  And another thing, I was talking to Karen, why'd you even wear that shirt?  Because you know I can't stay there.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Oh my God.  Shut up.  That's what you want to say, but that'll...  Yeah.  All right, bro.  We got to get you out of here. 
[02:29:30]  Brewer starts a rock and roll comedy tour.  He's going to be all over the country.  Yeah.  He starts tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt.  I'm going to miss you guys.  On Long Island.  We're all going.  I'll call from the road.  Yeah.  Give us some road story.  Oh, you got to do that.  We're sending messages in the morning.  Yeah.  Hey, I know you guys ain't there yet.  What are you doing?  We'll play a phone call.  We're in Athens.  Just, you know my number.  Just leave freaking calls.  I will.  Yeah.  All right.  I will.  I will.  We're all going tomorrow night.  And for New York, we got a couple pairs of tickets if you give us a call right now.

Yeah.  80% voted online that marijuana should be legalized.  I know the O&A factor had to come into play on that.  You never know.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, we'll talk about 2020 downtown, I guess, tomorrow.  All right, man.  Red Sox suck.  Anthony hasn't checked it out yet.  All right, man.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  Brewer came back. 
[02:32:00]  It's nice to get back, though.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, nothing much, guys.  What's up?  Talking to you.  Hey, I heard that Sex for Sam for the first time on the weekend replay.  We love that bit.  Oh, my God.  Love that one.  That was the funniest thing I've ever heard.  I normally don't listen to the radio on my days off from work, but I sat there and did  nothing just to hear that.  Oh, cool, man.  Hey, you guys maybe plan on doing a D.C. version?  We'd like to.  Yeah, could you imagine somebody going for a two-point conversion on a White House tour? 
[02:32:30]  Hey, that could work.  That would rock.  As soon as we find our audience in Washington, we'll come down and do some fun stuff.  Definitely.  Cool.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Brian.  Brewer's back.  I'm back.  I feel like my mom just, like, said, all right, just eat your green beans and go outside.  Yeah.  Nice.  No, I'm supposed to do a dress rehearsal tonight.  Yeah.  And you're getting too serious.  Dress rehearsals.  Yeah, with the lighting and all the cool stuff doing on it.  And just put some schlub in a suit to get all the spots and the lights right. 
[02:33:00]  I couldn't do it easy.  I couldn't, like, do a DJ.  Right.  But, uh, so it didn't get there yet.  And it's not going to be there until, like, nine at night.  Girl!  I'll just...  You know when the truck ain't going and your behind is sweaty and you're about to leave  all being ended, but your highness says do it and fly and say...  So I can hang.  Cool. 
[02:33:30]  And we're done.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  Wow, it's 6.30.  I don't care what this guy's trying to say.  Uh, Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Well, now that Brewer came back, it's not going to make much sense, but, uh, enough of  Naked Sexy Fun Time.  It's time to start the show.  Naked Sexy Fun Time?  Well, it's just...  I call everything Naked Sexy Fun Time.  It's a fun word to use.  You should try it.  What?  Smoke weed every day.  Okay, terrific.  What?  I don't know, man.  Let's see what Sacramento's doing today. 
[02:34:00]  Chris!  Hello?  What's up, Chris?  Chris?  Hello?  Yes?  You're on the radio, Chris.  What's up?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm on a terrible soft phone.  I apologize.  I've been waiting for so long.  I didn't know if I was ever going to get through.  And?  And, anyways, I wanted to...  Oh, no.  I'll be...  Oh!  What?  She was waiting two hours.  That's awful.  That is awful. 
[02:34:30]  She's from Sacramento.  It's a new city.  We want to make friends there before you start hanging up on people.  What?  Oh, and you give it to her right in Dustin Pierre.  Dustin Pierre.  All right.  We're done.  It's awful.  And we're done?  No, we're not done yet.  We're not done.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Where are you going?  Get back here.  You have things to do.  We gotta go.  I'm looking at my notes for my trip to see if I did everything.  Did you talk about your horrific plane ride across an entire ocean? 
[02:35:00]  Did it freak you out?  How long was it?  He was like...  Brewer, man.  I mean...  Brewer's well-traveled.  I'm going to say, big star like Brewer, and he likes the dope on occasion.  Have you ever gone to, like, Europe, across the Atlantic Ocean, flying for six straight  hours, realizing that you are effed if anything happens to the plane?  I get it.  There's nothing you can do.  Holy S.  There's nothing.  I was freaking.  See, you can't go there.  What are you freaking?  I was like...  You can't do it.  You can't do it.  I was coming back from Athens, and we flew when it was daylight out, which is a piece 
[02:35:30]  of cake.  Darkness.  You start thinking weird crap, right?  The plane don't know.  But you're over the Atlantic Ocean.  You're over the Atlantic Ocean for six straight hours.  Yeah.  It's black.  You start...  No, well, it's daylight.  This proves I'm really a wimp.  So you're looking down, and you're seeing the lovely Atlantic.  I'm looking what?  Seven straight miles down to the ocean, and you start thinking.  I'm watching Pulp Fiction.  I have a nice little DVD portable player, and I'm loving my Pulp Fiction, and then all 
[02:36:00]  of a sudden, I have to look out the window, and then my mind starts wandering, and I'm  like, man, you know, if we're over land, and there's like a little problem, well, we  just have to find an airport.  You got the time.  You always talk yourself down.  So I'm looking out.  That stuff always happens.  It happens.  We'll land in Philly.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  You know, the pilot has an hour before disaster.  Hey, you can find somewhere.  You can find something.  Crash landing or something.  We'll be all right.  I'm looking out.  Ladies and gentlemen.  It's a pilot calling from the flight deck. 
[02:36:30]  We've got a problem here.  Lost all hydraulic, but Pittsburgh's right down there.  Right.  We're going to try to find it.  We're just going to circle out.  We'll have some vodka.  Do some barrel rolls.  We're going to hand out some drinks.  It's okay, because we're over land, Opie.  Yeah.  Over land.  I know.  So I'm thinking, man, drove over the Atlantic Ocean for six straight hours.  It's seven miles straight down.  And now I'm thinking, whoa, whoa, what was that noise?  What was that noise?  I was losing it, man.  Uh-oh.  Losing it. 
[02:37:00]  These things go down.  They go down.  These things go down.  This is what I told.  Relax.  Relax.  This is what I told.  Sit down.  Relax.  This is what I told Anthony at lunch today, though.  I can handle if I'm going to be in a plane crash, if it's going to be, like, really quick  into the side of a mountain.  You really didn't see it coming.  You're still alive for a split second, dead to next.  This is what really freaked me out about flying over the Atlantic Ocean.  I'm thinking the plane drops out of the sky.  You're not dying right away.  You're screaming with 200 other freaking people.  Oh, and you know how people are. 
[02:37:30]  And you're going to have that fight to the window to bust it open to get through.  Whatever.  I must get out.  I had to slap myself in the face to get this out of my head.  Wow.  I was nosed.  It would just be, like, tumbling, and then you'd be talking.  And you know how people are, like, they'd be, oh, my God.  And then you've got to hear that for, like, four minutes or so.  Four straight minutes.  While you're plummeting to your desk.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Shut up, bro.  I know.  We're all in the same boat here. 
[02:38:00]  Crashing, dummy.  I only spent my last four minutes alive listening to that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Right in line to Murray.  Right in line to the children.  Right in on the puke pack, Murray.  Sit back, dummy.  We're going to die.  Screw it.  Just, like, just sit there and shut up.  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  Oh, my God.  Like Castaway crash scene.  Yes, Rick.  No.  You know why?  Yes, Rick.  That was a bull crap crash scene anyway. 
[02:38:30]  Anytime you see one of those planes go down in the water, they find pieces that look like  guitar picks.  It's guitar picks and body parts for everyone, Norton.  Well, none of that.  It looks like when a seagull just eyes it.  One.  Yeah.  It's not a gradual.  No.  Oh, well, bring it in.  I'm going to glide this in.  Yes.  The Boeing 767, very well equipped to glide.  Think about how hard your belly hurts when you do a belly flop four feet over.  Right, right.  Blame. 
[02:39:00]  How hard the water feels.  Put a couple tons, 40,000 miles an hour into that.  You think those engines, you think the engines on those planes are that big for aesthetics?  They need a lot of engine to keep those things in the air.  I was just beyond freight.  There's a lot of fat behind on a jumbo jack.  And when it goes down.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are about two minutes into our plummet to death.  About halfway there, so. 
[02:39:30]  Enjoy the ride.  Enjoy the ride.  If you look out the left side window, you will see we've lost our wing.  It has just ripped completely off in the wind.  And we've now reached terminal velocity.  We're now spinning around real fast.  We're spinning.  So some of you probably pinned to the cockpit walls and ceilings.  Cabin.  And it's going to be tough for you to even scream because the air being squeezed out of your lungs.  And we have lost cabin pressure.  And we'll see you on the ground.  And anybody interested in a beverage, just ask one of the flight attendants and be sure they'd be happy to give one to you. 
[02:40:00]  Thank you for flying TWA.  You can exam your backside as it's hovering out of your mouth.  Yeah, right?  That's kind of interesting.  Keep you busy for a while.  All right.  I don't know.  I don't think over the water it's any different than the land or anything.  I know.  Just something that, you know, I don't know.  You know where I see the land, you're thinking, you know, I saw the airport movies.  They had some time.  They were a little freaked.  That's true.  So if they do have that little problem, that little problem, like, all right, we're going to get a little red light up here on this. 
[02:40:30]  They don't know if they're going to make it, but they're going to at least try and there's a chance.  The first thing the pilot will do, which is tap it with my finger.  All right.  I've done that.  It's still on.  So now I guess we better land somewhere.  Oh, wait.  We're over the ocean.  Yeah, that's how many movies are hilarious.  Oh, I love those.  They're under the sea and the guys are, like, shrinking going, this sucks.  Yeah.  Oh, that was when they really got bad.  Like, the first one wasn't bad.  We're really stuck here.  The first one was the one with the bomb, right? 
[02:41:00]  There was the bomb and the briefcase.  Yeah, I think that was the first one.  But then they started getting Chuck Heston involved.  Yeah.  I've got to get from this plane to that one.  Pull me out on a cable.  Damn you, all the hell.  You blew it up.  If we take a quick break, we can play a game of what did we learn on the show.  All right.  Educational program.  Should be.  First day back.  I learned how to make a headache for myself.  I know.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.

Yeah, they're the best.  Someone asked me recently if we have comedy writers. 
[02:45:00]  I'm like, we don't need them, man.  No.  We got our writers.  Scuba writes, today I learned that when a problem comes along, you must dip it.  I forgot about that.  Also, a good fart sound effect is always funny.  All right.  Wow, it was a lot today.  Kenny's going to be checking out Jim Brewer tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  I hope a lot of people are.  Because we're going to have a party tomorrow night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

He's acting like he's on crack all the time.  The crack. 
[02:46:00]  The crack.  You're on crack.  Hey, Brewer.  What is that?  There you go.  Yeah, Brewer.  The crack.  He's dumber than he looks.  Hey, Brewer.  You look dumb, but you're dumber.

So, what do you got for the show today?  What do I have for the show?  Yeah, why'd you call us?  Well, I wanted to call and tell you that you guys...  It's a little joke.  It's a joke.

You've got to check that guy out.  I think he's playing Caroline's this weekend.  It's hilarious.  I'm going to sell out those shows for him, man.

Take it easy, Woodsy.  We saved his bit, and then he...  We saved it, and then he wrecked it by having to say the Michael Hunt thing again.  We all got what you were trying to say.  Right.  That's how we get away with some things here and there.  Ass.  Weep.  We don't have to fill in all the spaces.  Some people get it. 
[02:49:30]  John, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Welcome back from vacation, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mom.  I learned that when you're vacationing in Turkey, and you're going to eat a raspberry,  you better make damn sure it's a raspberry.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  That mall was huge, man.  All right, John.  Thanks, guys.  We got to talk about the lady by the pool in Athens, a hotel pool, 65-year-old lady with  the...  Did you find her age by checking her taint, hoping?  No?  No?  Okay.  I'm just checking. 
[02:50:00]  I'm just quickly guessing, Anthony.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I thought it was an accurate age, 65-years-old, with gorgeous boobs.  Really?  Breast implants.  Elephant skin around the knees, but...  Oh, man.  Yes.  Why, father.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, implant on a 65-year-old broad.  It was an interesting sight.  Ooh.  But she had elephant legs.  Elephant legs.  Come this way, Mary.  Where they have all the cellulite and the...  All right.  Like the kid in school... 
[02:50:30]  And the flies are hovering around with cracks.  The other kid in school, they bought, like, a piece of crap dodge dart and put a blower thing  on the hood, like, cut the blower thing, and got the colorful air filter to put on it.  It's still a dodge dart.  Why are you putting the implants...  Wow.  ...in the 65-year-old lady?  I have a feeling that was a birthday present from her husband. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  Yeah, it could have been.  There you go.  Hey, look at this guy.  Blind.  His name is Blind.  Says, I learned today I laughed within the first 20 minutes and didn't have to change the  station.  Oh, thank you.  According to the Rick rule.  Thank you.  Cool.  Quick stop from Levittown.  I learned that, according to Disney, there were black Nazis.  Right.  Yeah.  I never knew that, but does it?  No. 
[02:51:30]  According to Disney, you go to the Indiana Jones stunt show, they have, you know, Indy fights  the Germans, and I look up on the hill, and there's a prominent member of this stunt show  playing a Nazi soldier, and he's a black guy.  See how, mother effer?  There were black Germans, though.  Well, I know there were Germans, but I don't think you'd find any black German, any army  back during the Third Reich.  We don't have to remind you of drunk German Ed with the bullet hole in his head. 
[02:52:00]  I know.  He's a German.  He was in the German army, where he got the bullet hole in his head, and he's a black  guy.  True story.  Drunk German Ed!  Then what did he do?  He looked up.  He wasn't supposed to.  I looked up!  In a training mission?  Yeah, he was drunk from the night before he kept drinking.  He stood up, and a bullet hit him right in the helmet, and marked him permanently.  He got a bullet hole.  They call him drunk German Ed with the bullet hole in his head.  Bing!  True story.  Every minute, the guy, he's got a crater right here. 
[02:52:30]  He's got a big, like, hole with a bullet in his head.  Like, the helmet saved him from obvious death, but the bullet went...  The police went through my Kevlar helmet and hit my head.  I'm drunk German Ed with the bullet hole in my head.  But, like, Hitler wasn't too hip on that.  You know, I don't think he would have done that.  We've got to go, Ed.  Tom Mack writes, I learned that I could get an acting job at Disney as a trash man.  An acting job.  Hey, Brewer, we've got to do this fast.  Brewer, tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt in Long Island, we're all going.

Ever since Kurt Angle turned Stone Cold Steve Austin's appreciation night into a milk-o-mania,  the alliance leader has had payback on his mind.  Last week, the rattlesnake exacted some revenge when he stole Kurt Angle's Olympic gold medals  and threw him into the river.  What will Stone Cold Steve Austin have in store for Kurt tonight?  Hmm?  Tune in to find out.  Also, WCW owner Shane McMahon will do anything in his power to eliminate the biggest threat 
[02:54:00]  to the success of the alliance.  WCW champion, The Rock.  That's right.  Will the former five-time WCW champ, Booker T, finally get the respect he feels he deserves?  Whew.  Boy, this goes on and on.  Well, it's going to be really good.  I know, but you can't tell by this.  Smackdown.  We watch it.  It's fun.  Watch it tonight live on UPN in the New York City area.
