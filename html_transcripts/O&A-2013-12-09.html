FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Ooh!  Yo-y.  Yeah.  Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, everybody.  Yay, green tea.  Is it the one roasted with brown rice?  Favorite.  Ooh, thank you.  Can you put honey in this shit?  You want it?  Yeah, because it tastes like crap. 
[00:00:30]  It's not my favorite.  I'm trying not to drink a lot of coffee, that's why.  Is there sugar with this one, Kenny?  How many?  What's the amount?  How much sugar do you do in your tea?  Four.  You do old lady tea.  I do.  What is that, a Lipton's?  It's Lipton.  I hate Lipton's tea.  I actually hate tea.  I like a good Lipton.  But I need some kind of warm beverage in the morning that's not coffee. 
[00:01:00]  Lipton.  Lipton tea stinks.  I should drink it like an old bag.  Do you put milk in it, too?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  It's plenty of milk, plenty of sugar.  Oh, God.  I have to have my tea in the morning, my Lipton's.  I got this plain green tea, but it's roasted in brown rice.  Yeah, that's odd.  Don't you worry at home, people.  The brown rice isn't floating around in it.  Why is my mic very over-modulated?  Isn't it?  Mine is, too. 
[00:01:30]  Ah!  Something sounds amiss.  Is Mars here today?  No.  No, because I saw the monitors were all up.  His knee hurts.  So he's out there.  What?  What do you mean, his knee hurts?  Do you know I...  Is he taekwondo-ing?  I'm just saying this because Mars is out with the knee thing.  I couldn't even turn all week last week.  I had a ridiculous neck thing happening.  I could have taken a few days. 
[00:02:00]  Could have.  Fuck!  I'm only laughing.  What do you mean his knee hurts?  Well, I'll read you the email.  I'll pull it up.  Oh.  It was really funny.  Is it funny like...  Roland's?  Like Roland's funny?  Yeah, I would say it's funny in the same way.  Okay.  Is it sweltering in here?  Yeah, it is.  Well, it was freezing when I got in.  I turned up our thermometer that either goes from 40 to 100.  It's like...  It can't...  We have the worst thermometer known to man.  I'm sweating.  It should be digital or something. 
[00:02:30]  It's this...  You can...  There's only a quarter inch where you can move it.  And in that quarter inch, it goes from either like 50, 55 to 100.  Now the papers are going to be blown around the table.  Yeah, yeah.  There's going to be ice in here.  What do you do with like...  Does green tea and like honey work?  I don't know.  I need a stirrer.  Can I get a little stirrer?  Oh, boy.  There, I did it.  How much of the shit you put in here? 
[00:03:00]  Is that good?  I don't know.  Can I get a stirrer?  Yeah.  No stirrer.  I need a stirrer.  All right.  What's Morris' email?  Oh, boy.  Subject line is, I am out today.  Yeah.  And then the body is, hey, guys, my knee hurts quite a bit today.  Right.  I am taking a sick day today.  Right.  I spoke to George, and he is testing out the stage.  I don't know who George is.  Who is George?  I've never heard of this George.  You know who George is.  Who's George?  Which one is George? 
[00:03:30]  You know which one is.  Oh, Kenny's saying it in a way like, oh, boy.  Is he the one that has no social skills whatsoever?  That guy?  One.  But I guess he's really good at his job.  But I think you want an engineer that has no social skills, right?  You do.  Yeah, because that means the other side of their brain is working a little extra.  Yep.  Yeah, like me, G.H., I have no social skills, but I'm great at what I do.  Good point.  Like me, G.H.  More importantly, though, how is George's knee? 
[00:04:00]  George's knee?  George.  Yeah.  Did his knee hurt?  Why?  Because that's why Mars isn't here.  His knee hurts quite a bit today.  But you know what I do when I take a day off?  I go, hey, I'm taking a day off.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't need to know that you've got a bad knee or you're shitting out your asshole.  Because whatever you write, it's going to sound like an excuse.  It just doesn't.  It's never going to sound right.  There's guilt there.  And Mars probably could have made it in today, but he's using some fucking knee injury.  I guess Mars can't stand coming to work. 
[00:04:30]  He can't stand coming to work.  Kind of like that one.  That is a good one, Kenny.  Yeah.  You're fun.  Anybody watch any of the football games?  A lot of shit going down yesterday.  I don't have to watch them.  I just read Travis's fucking...  What?  Highlight sheet?  His tweets, and it sounds like fucking the greatest games ever being played.  It was the greatest games ever being played.  I was losing my mind.  Wait, where's E-Rock?  Oh.  E-Rock is... 
[00:05:00]  Oh, no.  Eric has eye problems.  He can't see coming to work.  Kenny couldn't wait.  Hey, Kenny!  Wait, where's E-Rock today?  Where's E-Rock?  He's got a little day for himself today.  What?  He had one to...  I just saw him Saturday.  He had one to set up for the party, and now it was a post-party.  We all know how wild that party was.  He needs a little recovery time.  Does he need a little recovery?  I think so.  Wait, he took another day?  Yeah, he decided to give himself a nice little four-day weekend. 
[00:05:30]  That's nice.  Coming off the four-day Thanksgiving weekend.  Oh, really?  Followed up with another one.  Why not?  That's nice.  That's wonderful.  Good for him.  He will not be missed.  Go E-Rock.  Huh?  That wasn't the...  I swear to God, I didn't even know he wasn't here today.  Yeah.  I just assumed I would hear E-Rock's voice from that other room, but it's Travis.  Travis, why was yesterday such a great day for football?  It was just...  It was the weekend that you hope you get, like, during a football season, where so many  games in such a short amount of time were so good. 
[00:06:00]  There was, like, three different snow games.  Yeah, the snow games were amazing.  I love Red Zone, because I got to see a lot of the Eagles game.  That was crazy how much snow was coming down.  It just feels like old-school football that way.  It feels like that's how you should be playing football.  Right.  Yeah.  In the snow.  How do you feel about the idiots that go out there with their short sleeves still?  It doesn't bother me.  I just...  It makes them look tough.  Yeah, and they're manly men.  Tough guy.  In the end, I just can't imagine doing that.  Football is so much fun to go to in the cold. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Oh, stop it.  It really is.  TV, all kinds of different views.  He's not wrong, man.  I used to love going to the Bills games, especially when it was shitty weather.  Burr.  I don't know.  There was something about it.  A little flask of whiskey or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Warm yuck.  Bring a little something in.  It's just for some reason you don't get as cold as you would if you were just standing  around doing something else.  That's because you're packed in fucking shoulder to shoulder with people wearing giant fucking  Gore-Tex coats.  Well, your seat gets a lot smaller all of a sudden.  Wow.  But there were some great snow games yesterday. 
[00:07:00]  But then they would turn to another snow game, and it wasn't as great as the Eagles  snow game.  No, I mean, the Eagles...  And then it kind of bummed you out that Pittsburgh didn't have more snow.  And then it stopped snowing in Philly, so it wasn't like...  Right.  But when it was almost like blizzard conditions, and you just couldn't...  You couldn't even see the Lions players because they were wearing white.  Damn.  Yeah, look at that.  It was great.  Oh, nice.  You can't look at that.  We're looking at that.  And then you got the Patriots with this ridiculous comeback. 
[00:07:30]  Patriots were down the entire game to Cleveland.  Right.  And then they scored, what, twice in 90 seconds?  Yeah.  Kicked an onside kick.  They did the onside that, you know...  It worked.  Works sometimes.  Rarely works.  Rarely, yeah.  Got the ball back, scored a touchdown.  And they win.  Unbelievable.  Their record...  They're 10-3.  They just don't seem like a 10-3 team.  Tom Brady knows how to win.  Good point, I guess.  Oh, that's great.  They had to bring out the snowblower for the yards.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's awesome. 
[00:08:00]  That's nice.  That's just how football should be played.  What field looked like they heat up the numbers?  Because you could still see the numbers.  You saw that?  Yeah, that may have been...  Was that Pittsburgh?  I think it might be Pittsburgh, right.  It looks like they have some kind of, like, technology where the numbers are...  You could constantly see the numbers, even though the rest of the field was all fucked up.  Because it looked too perfect.  Yeah.  They just run out there every down and just paint them again.  Yeah.  And then my Jets.  I was ready to tap out with the Jets. 
[00:08:30]  And then Geno Smith, after I called him a bum last week, of course this happened.  He has a really good game.  He stepped up.  Yeah, he stepped up.  Unlike Mars.  So now Jets Nation, we're hoping we have an outside shot at the playoffs still.  Jets Nation.  And I've already gave up on the fucking team.  And then Geno does all right.  So, I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  The Jets Nation.  Was it...  There's more football.  Was it computer graphics, people are saying?  What? 
[00:09:00]  People are saying if the numbers were shown with a computer graphics that were overlaid.  Oh, no kidding.  Really?  On the TV.  Stupid me.  I go old school.  I just assumed they had some kind of heating system.  Yeah, it might have just been that they're pretty good with that.  It does sound kind of silly.  A heating system that's designed to wear numbers?  Right.  I don't know.  Like, you've got to see it.  The whole field was, you know, covered with snow, but you could still see the numbers.  And they were perfect.  And they were perfect.  That's some amazing technology that they could do that. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  So, why don't they just erase all the snow?  Just erase the snow.  Well, if you could erase the snow around the numbers, why not just erase the snow on the field?  Just make the snow green.  Right.  I don't think it was that game.  Well, the numbers are showing there.  But the numbers are showing.  It looks like they just...  Yeah, but those...  Those, you could tell, were...  They snow bloated them.  Yeah, they just swept it away.  There was another game where the numbers were, like, perfect, even though the whole field  was completely covered. 
[00:10:00]  The numbers are superimposed.  A lot of people are saying that.  Fox did a good job with the graphic.  Okay.  Wow.  I did not know they were doing that.  Fox.  And then you got a guy setting the field goal record.  What was that, 64?  64, finally.  That's crazy.  64, 64, 64, Zulane.  Sorry.  Kid shit.  Yeah, 64 yards beating Tom Dempsey.  And actually, Tom Dempsey and many others.  Like, four others, I think.  Yeah, four times.  Yeah, the record's been tied four times.  Dempsey said it originally. 
[00:10:30]  And now you got the 64-yarder from Matt Prater.  Prater?  Prater?  Yeah, but it was in Denver.  Yeah, they got that...  Well, you know, you got that thin air shit.  Yeah, but still.  It's still impressive.  It's crazy.  You're going to try to set the record.  Look how fucking far away he is.  That's crazy.  That's ridiculous.  Holy shit.  That is fucking amazing.  How many extra yards did he have there? 
[00:11:00]  Not many, right?  Maybe a couple?  What do you mean?  Like, how much room?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I mean...  From the angle we just saw, you couldn't tell.  I mean, it was really close.  Yeah.  Wow.  You think 64 will be broken eventually in Denver?  It's the only place that it could possibly be.  At some point, somebody will kick from the end zone.  Yeah, okay.  And fucking just a hundred-yard field goal.  Uh-oh. 
[00:11:30]  Jimmy Norton.  Just one of those days.  What are you going to do?  It's just really shitty out there.  Oh, man.  It took me, like, almost 20 minutes longer today to drive in than normal.  I went down at eight minutes of, and I waited, I think, until night, which people who don't  live in New York, it was a long time.  Yeah, yeah.  It was not one town car.  It was fucking nothing.  Nothing.  No town cars out front either.  I would have taken a town car or anything.  Yeah, you usually got those town car guys, you know, swirling around, hoping for somebody.  Yeah.  We're just talking about football.  It was a really good day for football, so. 
[00:12:00]  I didn't watch.  I didn't either.  I just hear shit on the news, and I blurt out like I watched.  I'm like, oh, yeah, that was a 64-yard field goal.  64.  Oh, yeah.  64.  64.  Zulane.  Can you play that for me?  I don't know what it is.  You're happy today?  It's a kid's show.  That is.  From Australia or something.  I can't do the accent like the little girl when she sings it.  There it is.  We played it before.  What do you mean you don't know it?  64, 64, 64 Zulane.  64, 64, 64 Zulane. 
[00:12:30]  Hello, I'm Lucy.  I live at 64 Zulane, and I have some very special neighbors.  Get in the car.  Your mother says there's an emergency.  You know, she lives close to a zoo.  Little kid's pocket.  Kid's shop.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  I swear, at any moment today, this temporary bridge could fly right out of my face. 
[00:13:00]  To the fucking console.  Where's this bridge, actually?  Back here.  Right.  It has to attach to the wisdom tooth.  Right.  And then there's one tooth missing.  Right.  And then it attaches to the next tooth there.  Right.  So it bridges, you know, between there.  Right.  Well, my dentist was going to put in a permanent bridge.  Right.  So she's testing around.  I'm like, you know what?  This fucker's been hurting.  Right.  I don't want you to put the bridge on and have this fucking pain in the air.  So she goes, all right, go down the hall here to this fucking root canal doctor. 
[00:13:30]  So I do the x-ray and go, oh, yeah, that's got, you know, root canal.  So I go, okay.  They do the root canal.  And the dentist at the root canal took off the temporary bridge, which isn't supposed  to be taken off and then put back on.  Right.  But then they just put it back on.  Right.  And said, well, get to your dentist as quick as you can.  Oh, boy.  But as quick as you can does not, it's not the weekend.  So I could probably go today.  I'll fit in like today, later this afternoon or something.  Right.  But for the whole weekend, this thing has been on just, it hasn't been fastened to the 
[00:14:00]  wisdom tooth.  Right.  It's just been fastened to the forward tooth.  Right.  So it's, it's like, it's shaking around in my mouth.  Every time my tongue hits it, it goes to the side a little bit.  I'm waiting to either swallow it or spit it out.  Can you chew?  Well, on the right side.  Oh, that's always a pain.  But I could feel it like if my tongue hits it.  Right.  And shaking it back and forth, it's got to be making it looser and looser.  Pull it out for the day.  Freak me out.  No, I'll just leave it until it flies out of my head. 
[00:14:30]  What?  You can hear it just then.  It's very hard to talk.  I'm talking like Spock.  Yeah.  Live long and prosper.  All the dentures get put in.  It's sad.  It's sad what happens to radio guys.  I am so retiring before all that happens.  Howard has a little thing happening.  His has got a little better, but he's got a little.  Talking over the dentures.  Yeah.  And then Imus.  Yeah, because he had to get used to, I guess, his dentures or something. 
[00:15:00]  Imus sounds like Mr. Magoo now.  Hey, Imus in the morning program.  Like his voice goes up.  Right.  Now, I guess.  Well, that's because he's like trying to keep everything in his mouth.  Well, I don't know what happened there.  It used to sound like, I'll bite Georgie Magoo.  You've done it again.  And then Scott Shannon.  Oh, God.  He just has meatballs in his mouth.  I don't know what the fuck's going on there.  What the hell is going on with him?  Yeah, we've got to tap out before that happens. 
[00:15:30]  Well, at least this will be fixed.  You ought to call a dentist and say that your bridge work ain't no good.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How would that go?  Hey there, Dr. Dentist.  This is Bridgie McWorkfallens.  Yes?  Can I help you?  My bridge fell out.  That's all I got.  I'm tired. 
[00:16:00]  64, 64, 64, Zulane.  In honor of Matt Prater.  Prater?  I don't fucking know.  And then, Travis, why aren't you talking about the Ravens?  That was the game.  That was the game.  That's your guys too, right?  Yeah, it was...  Six lead changes in the fourth quarter?  Yeah, five touchdowns in the last two minutes.  Five touchdowns in the last two minutes of the game?  That's crazy.  There wasn't even enough time to get excited.  Right.  Because the second you got over being excited, you got sad.  I had a bad idea. 
[00:16:30]  Wait, there's a montage of the last two minutes.  It's crazy.  You have to watch it.  This might just be the calls, though.  No, the...  Yeah.  Oh, that was just the picture.  I'm sorry.  Just the audio.  Yeah, that's fine, though.  So you got five touchdowns in the final 125 seconds, and then Ravens ended up winning 29-26.  Holy shit.  It was insane.  Flacco passes left.  Caught.  Whoa.  Touchdown, Baltimore Ravens.  It's a touchdown for Dennis Pitta.  To Gerhardt.  Sneaky.  Plenty of room.  40.  30.  Lowers the helmet. 
[00:17:00]  20.  Inside the 10.  Touchdown!  Fielded by Jacoby Jones at the 21 to the 30, he's to the 40.  He has only Blair Walsh to beat.  He gets by him at the 30, to the 20.  Jacoby Jones!  Touchdown!  Wow!  Oh, Jacoby Jones, are you kidding me?  Flips it out to Cordero Patterson to the right side.  Gets a great block from Matt Aziato.  And Cordero gets loose at the 40, to the Ravens 50.  He's gone!  And Cordero Patterson is gone!  Wow!  Flacco, empty backfield, takes the snap, passes back left to the end zone. 
[00:17:30]  It's caught, Marlon Brown.  Is he out of bounds?  Nope, they say touchdown.  One of the most exciting fourth quarters in the history of the National Football League  goes the way of the Baltimore Ravens.  The final score, Ravens 29, Vikings 26.  Obviously, he's not the Ravens announcer there at the end.  At the 40, the 30, the win!  It was crazy because...  It was kickoff returns.  It's a 79-yard touchdown, and then you think it's over. 
[00:18:00]  There's 45 seconds left.  The Ravens are...  Yeah, it's done.  Yeah, they're not going to win.  And then they score again.  There were 90 touchdowns yesterday?  90 touchdowns.  Is that real?  Yeah, it's a record.  That's an amazing game.  That's a record?  Yeah.  Yes, all 90 in that game.  Who scored them?  Yeah.  And then, finally, Drew Brees became the fifth quarterback in history, and the fastest  to throw for more than 50, geez, 50,000.  Yep.  Who's on that list, you might ask?  Joe Montana? 
[00:18:30]  Joe Montana's not on that list.  Oh, damn it.  A lot of...  John Elway?  John Elway is on that list.  Ah!  Danny Marino?  Danny Marino is on that list.  Are you looking down at your computer?  No, no, no.  All right, very good so far.  I'm trying to...  And then two newer-ish guys.  Tom Brady?  No.  Oh, wow.  What is Tom Brady up to? 
[00:19:00]  Yards-wise.  I would have thought he was on that list.  Yeah.  Got a guy from his era on that list, though.  Oh, oh, okay.  Oh!  He's a blockhead.  Manning?  Yes, he's a blockhead.  He does horrendous credentials, but he's very good at throwing that.  Yes, yes.  Peyton Manning is on that list.  And then finally, a guy that probably doesn't know he's on that list.  Oh!  That would be Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre. 
[00:19:30]  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  How do you get far out of F-A-V-R-E?  Favre.  I don't know, man.  Isn't it pronounced Favre, technically?  R-V-E.  Brett Favre, I think.  Brett Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  Favre.  And Brady's seventh.  Brady's got to wait until next year to get on that list.  He's got 48,000.  48,000.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to have to wait a year.  And who's in sixth?  As you get that list off.  Warren Moon.  Remember him?  Remember Warren Moon.  Is he dead or something? 
[00:20:00]  Or did he shoot somebody?  Jesus.  Did someone shoot him?  Didn't Warren Moon have a problem?  I want to say Doug Williams died.  You're thinking about black quarterbacks.  I thought Doug Williams died.  No, there's a problem with Warren Moon, too.  What happened to Warren Moon?  Wow.  I don't know.  Not in the early years.  There you go.  No, he's good.  Personal life.  Nothing bad in there?  It's in the movie Any Given Sunday.  Yeah, that was the problem.  Oh, here you go.  Here you go.  Uh-oh.  Thank you.  Arrested on suspicion of DUI in 2007. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  That's the problem.  Wow.  That's a little less than shooting somebody.  Shooting somebody, yeah.  Is Doug Williams dead?  Did I just say that right or wrong?  I don't know.  All right.  Doug Williams?  Yeah.  He's the quarterback for the Redskins when they won.  I thought Warren Moon had a bigger problem than that.  Doug Williams is not dead.  Okay, good.  Football facts.  He'll be happy to hear that. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, we suck.  We're way off.  58 and living comfortably.  Okay, good.  Living comfortably.  So Warren Moon's not in jail and Doug Williams is alive.  Right.  0 for 2.  I'm so glad we got that right.  Where are your football headquarters?  So there you have it.  Jimmy Eric's out today because he needed to take a day after his party, I guess.  A day or two.  I don't understand why.  Oh, we all get personal days, right?  Yeah.  I might squeeze one out this week.  But wasn't he gone Friday?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So Friday, he kind of just gave himself a little vacation. 
[00:21:30]  A little vacation.  A little bumper.  Just a little...  A little cushion.  It's also like, why not invite the entire show to your house, and then on the day people  might talk about it, decide to take the day.  Yeah, man.  So what, we got to wait till tomorrow?  That's right.  Oh, Steve McNair.  Thank you.  I was thinking of Steve McNair.  Look up Steve McNair.  Okay.  Or this guy could do it for us.  Fuck Google.  Mark in Michigan, what do you got on Steve McNair?  I got...  All I know is he's dead, man.  I think he...  There's a suicide involved, man. 
[00:22:00]  I just...  I knew that you were trying to think of that.  I'm sorry, man.  No, fuck.  Steve McNair is dead.  Oh, he is.  All right.  That's just like saying Warren Moon might have a major problem.  Thanks, Mark.  On July 4, 2009, McNair was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds along with the body  of a young woman.  Whoa.  Why do you have to take the other person out with you?  You selfish fuck.  Well, if he was dead of multiple gunshot wounds, I don't think it was a murder-suicide. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, no.  Wow, I am just getting everything wrong.  Maybe he shot his legs and arms first.  That's hilarious.  Did she kill him?  Yeah.  Well, the woman had a single gunshot wound to the head.  All right.  That seems like...  Maybe she shot him.  All right.  It still makes sense.  You know, leave the other person alone.  Yeah, that seems like...  Take yourself out, you selfish fuck.  See, it's still worse.  It's still worse.  That's who you were talking about.  Yeah, you should have just waited another second.  You could have...  Yeah, no, I know.  I'm saying it was her.  Oh, and he was married.  Oh, yeah.  I remember this whole thing. 
[00:23:00]  We've been dating this 20-year-old chick.  Oh, Christ.  She killed him and herself?  It appears that way.  What year?  Uh, 2009.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Crazy ass bitch.  All right.  Good, man.  Good enough.  So you decided to watch the Brady Bunch instead of go to EROC?  No.  That's really insulting.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's incredibly insulting.  There's not even new episodes of that anymore.  God. 
[00:23:30]  It was the Hawaiian episode.  Yeah, it was the Hawaiian episode.  The three-parter?  So, you know, that's the important thing.  Man.  No, I actually watched just the first episode.  Yeah.  It would have taken you half a day to get there anyway.  I live 15 minutes from, 20 minutes from EROC, but you have to leave this island of Manhattan  of ours?  Yeah.  It took an hour just to leave this island of Manhattan of ours.  I fucking hate living in the city.  It was a consideration, the time factor, and the thought of driving to Jersey to drink 
[00:24:00]  and then drive back on a Saturday during the holiday season, I didn't trust myself.  You can always get a new car, though.  What?  You have an Uber car take you.  How would I...  Don't you have drivers and shit?  What habits all those people?  I actually couldn't find anybody that was willing to, you know, hang out.  I would have been solo.  You don't have Uber?  And I'm not just whoring for them.  What's Uber?  It's an app that you put on your phone, and I had to use it the other night. 
[00:24:30]  It's...  How convenient is it?  Amazing.  Really?  I hit this button.  Right.  It opens up, and you have to have your location services on, because once it opens up, it says...  You give them your credit card information.  They have it on file.  So it says, set a pickup location.  You click to where you are.  I think you can hit one button, and then it just says, request taxi.  And you do that, and a driver will come to you, and it shows you how far he is, and it gives you a picture of the guy that's coming and his name. 
[00:25:00]  What, an actual picture of the guy?  Yeah, because they belong to Uber.  It's like...  Wow, that's great.  And it's a bunch of town cars.  I used it when I was in L.A.  Is there some kind of high sign when you get in?  You gotta, like, you know, give them, like, a gang sign or something?  No, you recognize them because of the picture.  And sometimes they'll call.  Once in a while, the location services are a bit off.  They had trouble finding me the other night, so he called me.  And he goes, um...  And I'm like, oh, no, you're a couple blocks away.  He goes, okay, I'll be right there.  And what is...  Like, who is he?  He's a black car driver.  They have the all-town cars. 
[00:25:30]  And I guess they have to have a certain standard, I'm guessing, to do that.  But it's a really cool thing, and most of the town car guys belong to it.  And it works?  Yeah, yeah.  It's more expensive in shitty weather, of course, but you have to...  They tell you that.  It says, you know, hey, tonight's rates are two and a half times more than normal.  So it's more than just cabs on that thing?  Normally it's a little bit more, but it was really expensive the other night.  But again...  You know what I mean?  It's more than just cab drivers?  Oh, yeah.  They're all black town cars.  So it's not the cabbies?  They're not yellow cars, no. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, okay.  They have one for cabs, too, I think.  There is a cab one where you can see what cab...  Oh, the cabbies must hate that app, then.  Well, for them, they probably love it, though, because those guys ride around at night all  the time and don't have a fare.  Of course.  So I would say that it helped a lot.  I think the car companies hate it more than the cabs, because the town cars and cabs  don't compete that much.  I think it's the car companies with the town cars that compete...  Right.  And Fox had the worst...  I had nothing but bad experiences with that fucking...  What is it?  First corporate or whoever they were? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's nice to, like, fucking be able to...  Oh, I'll have to put that app on my telephone.  Well, I'm not putting any apps on my telephone because I left the house without my phone.  Oh, shit.  It is the weirdest fucking feeling.  That is like...  I don't even know what to do with myself.  That's the new anxiety.  You know, we were feeling like you keep wanting to do something.  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck to do.  We might actually have conversations with people today.  Yeah, you could, you know, pull out your wallet and pull out a card and read it.  So weird.  Then I was thinking, we used to do this for more than half our lives. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Not a phone to be found.  I don't know.  I'm just...  All right.  Does it not feel weird now?  It's like you can't picture life before.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  It's so fucking bizarre.  It's really strange.  It's almost like when the power goes out and you keep hitting the light switch.  Like, you probably keep going like, oh, let me check...  Right.  Oh, that's right.  I can't.  Oh, I think I'll look at...  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to have it.  I guess I could check Twitter on a computer, but that's about it.  Computer.  I just like to go out and Google sometimes.  Nothing.  For no reason.  Yeah, it's fun.  There are times on my phone, I'm just going, what am I doing? 
[00:27:30]  I'm checking the sound.  I get nauseous sometimes.  Same thing over and over.  Facebook, Twitter, email, text, repeat.  Facebook, Twitter, email, text, repeat.  It really is.  Exactly why?  A worthless four-click system.  Yes.  It's the same shit.  No update, no app mentions, no new emails, no text pictures of cunts, no app mails, no  app mentions.  It's all the same shit.  I'm slowing down a little bit.  I don't check it as much.  It's kind of nice, actually.  I'll give myself an hour or so. 
[00:28:00]  An hour?  Yeah.  Well, that's a lot of time.  It is.  Think about it.  Most of us are like...  I'm not kidding.  ...like you're saying.  Yeah.  Just go round and round.  Round and round.  Oh, rat.  When you get a bunch of words with friends games going, too, that's one more reason to check it,  though.  Oh, man.  Fucking...  Still playing that, huh?  I am.  At least I got Sudoku's old style.  Old school.  Look at this Sudoku.  You're putting pen to paper.  Whoa.  That's a bonus.  I did the high five.  The Sudoku high five.  Damn.  Try the high five without any worksheet. 
[00:28:30]  No.  No worksheet needed.  Damn.  Yes.  The high five.  It's five connecting Sudoku puzzles.  What are you going to do next?  The jumble?  No.  And then I was reading Dagwood.  Oh, God.  No, not Dagwood.  Blondie.  Oh, Jesus.  Blondie's the best.  Did you know that Blondie added, like, a son and a daughter?  What year did they add the son and daughter?  Really?  Come on.  And that son looks exactly like the old man.  Look at this stupid fuck.  That's a good thing. 
[00:29:00]  Jimmy, you want to read this?  He looked like Mr. Bumstead.  Yeah, I'd love to have a nice laugh.  Jimmy loves the comics, so I brought this in for him.  It's the new Blondie with the kid that looks like...  I mean, it looks exactly like the old man.  Yeah, it looks like...  I guess that was their way of updating the comic strip.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Even the drawing looks like 1930s.  It's a seasonal strip.  Oh, this is a long one.  Well, yeah, man.  It's all about Christmas and Christmas decorations.  Oh, okay. 
[00:29:30]  Starts off with...  It's Dagwood.  He's at the bottom of the steps, and the dog is there, and they're both looking up.  And he's holding a gift, and he goes, Alex, you ready?  And the next one, there's the guy, the teenager, looks just like him, and he...  That's Al...  His name's Alex.  Alex!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  That'd be nice if they did that.  Yeah, and the four of them attack Blondie and fucking raped her and sodomized her.  And he's like, ready for love, ready for Mr. Bumstead. 
[00:30:00]  And so the kid walks in, and Dagwood's holding the gift, and the kid goes, all set, Dad!  And he goes, attaboy.  And the next one, Dagwood, there's a mistletoe.  There you go, son.  The world's only...  This is getting good.  This is getting good.  Hold on.  The world's only bad peppermint mistletoe.  What? 
[00:30:30]  And he goes, that's my favorite, Dad, in a peppermint mistletoe.  Oh, my God!  And then the next...  Oh, oh, there's more.  The next frame is he's holding...  Now, it's only a shot of this.  He's holding the box, and it says, Yule Snooze Ornaments.  Yule, Y-U-L-A.  And it says...  I'm sorry, guys. 
[00:31:00]  It says, and of course, your favorite, Pillow Ornaments Never Get Old.  And then Alex says, Never!  And then the next one is Dagwood's hanging a wreath on the door.  We like wreaths.  And Alex says, I had a hunch your triple-decker sandwich wreath was up next.  And Dagwood goes, Yep!  But then you look at the wreath. 
[00:31:30]  Killing us.  This is great.  And it's all sandwiches on it.  It's a little wreath.  Oh, all right, nice.  So you referenced it.  You know, you've got to see it.  I would assume these are all, you know, ornaments and things that are for him and his family.  Yeah, but then the next one is he's putting, like, a pillow, and it's got, like, candy canes on it.  And Dagwood says, I had my candy cane pillow for a holiday season.  What? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, and then Alex says, Still shiny as ever.  And then they got the tree with the little, uh, looks like, I don't know, a little pudgy Italian guy on top.  And it's his, uh, Alex goes, I'm glad you didn't forget your Paul Prudhomme treetopper.  And he goes, yeah, it's a classic.  Paul Prudhomme.  Oh, I didn't know that one.  The famous chef, right?  Now the next one is just the kitchen. 
[00:32:30]  It's just the gals.  It's the wrap-up.  It's the wrap-up, and it's Blondie, and she's talking to, I guess, the daughter.  She said, the daughter says, couldn't we have normal decorations one year?  And then Blondie says, not a chance.  Your dad only wants tried and true family traditions.  Oh, wow.  Tense, you know, the sandwich wreath and the pillow things. 
[00:33:00]  He sleeps.  And the yules.  Right, right, right.  Oh, man.  That's a good one.  I think that's, uh.  That's a home run right there.  Oh, man.  Your regular Fiorello LaGuardia.  That's funny.  I think the comic strip is a dying art form.  Oh, no way.  It's been dying for 50 years.  God, would they keep fucking putting those in newspapers?  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  Even buying newspapers.  What a waste of space that is.  Dude, it's half a page in the paper.  It fucking sucks.  I read this. 
[00:33:30]  I'm like, I don't get it.  Yeah.  Why would you enjoy this?  Yeah.  Does it give anyone pleasure to sit there and you ruffle the paper in front of your face,  cross your legs, and you're like, all right, let me take a look.  God, no.  When I was a kid, maybe.  Very well, Dagwood.  Very well.  It's son, Alex.  They put a fucking ball in her mouth, in Blondie's mouth, and they slap her in the  face.  Oh, yeah.  Take that big fucking cock in the room. 
[00:34:00]  Cut that shit, sonny.  Oh, we got to go back to football.  What?  What happened?  I didn't know this, Sam Roberts.  The Steelers player that appears to put his thumb up one of the Dolphins player's ass.  Yeah.  You got to see.  What?  And he gets all, the guy in the Dolphins gets all pissed off.  Of course he would.  Because there was a thumb.  Oh, he's probably helping for more fingers.  Yes.  He's like, that's all you got?  All right, here you go.  Now, you got to watch carefully. 
[00:34:30]  Where are we watching?  Whose asshole are we looking at?  The guy on the ground.  Oh, Jesus.  You can see it already.  Yeah?  Is the play over?  Yeah, the play's over.  Oh, wow.  He's fucking digging in.  He's already digging in before we even start the video.  The play's over.  Yeah.  And you can watch him.  They go, this, the thumbnail.  Does he pull out a plum?  See that old gag?  It's as they're getting up, though.  Like, there's no reason for him to be doing it.  Right.  For his own pleasure. 
[00:35:00]  I love when there's snow on the ground.  Oh, yeah.  It's awesome.  Just the lines are.  Okay, now watch.  Okay, he plays over.  Now he goes right to his asshole.  And he's got his hand on his thigh.  What's he doing?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is that about?  Doug his finger and his asshole.  Grabbed and shook his hand.  Yeah, he's mad.  He's so fucking pissed.  But the announcers can't explain why he's mad.  He's angry.  He's angry.  He put his thumb up his asshole. 
[00:35:30]  Look how hard he did that.  He shakes his hand.  Oh, my God.  He goes right for the asshole.  Because the play's over.  And like you said, his left hand.  You got to turn around like, hey, what are you doing?  His left hand is on his upper leg, but still far away from the asshole.  And he digs in.  Totally.  Digs his thumb right up there.  The guy rolls over like a baby would.  Yeah.  He turned over on his back.  He looked at him like, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah.  Was there a penalty call?  Was it mentioned?  Yeah.  Has it been explained?  Of course.  They threw a flag on the play, but just so he could wipe his hand off. 
[00:36:00]  That's fucked up.  Damn.  Look at his big dumb legs.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  What, is he trying to make him, like, let go of the ball?  I don't know.  That's a fucking, like, dominance move.  He lets their friends.  He's trying to make them, like, you know, you're my bitch.  It's like, how bad do you want to hold on to that ball?  Because I'm shoving a thumb up your ass.  Right?  Thumb your ass.  Football players are rough.  Oh, okay. 
[00:36:30]  There's danger.  Huh?  No, just the thing.  He said, player shoves his finger in the player's tings.  Perennium.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Tyson Walter would probably answer that question.  Yeah.  But you can't text me today, Tyson, because I don't have my fucking phone.  There's some weird shit that goes on, I bet you, in the pileups and stuff.  That's what I'm saying.  Tyson was an animal in the NFL.  By the way, that video is going up on the Facebook page and the Twitter account.  We post all the links on our Twitter, too, now.  Right.  Oh, and a show.  Oh, and a show is our official Twitter account for the radio show. 
[00:37:00]  Good.  Yeah, I mean, he caught a thumb right up there.  Yeah, he did.  He was like, Miami came away with it, though, on first glance.  That's pretty fucked up.  I'd be upset, too.  These guys are fucking stinking.  You never want that.  Oh, my God.  Those pileups.  You must be smelling all sorts of literally shit.  That's what happened with wrestling in school when they had to, you know, you got to do wrestling.  And you don't have to be in wrestling in gym class.  I avoided the wrestling crap.  I did, too. 
[00:37:30]  But, like, the one or two times that I had to do it because it was part of gym class, I would just give up the second someone grabbed a round.  Like, all right, you take the low position or something, and you'd have to get on all fours.  And the guy would just grab, like, your neck and then take his hand, grab your fucking, like, your balls to flip you over.  I'd just be like, yeah, whatever.  You win.  I want no part of this.  Fucking sucked.  You take the fuck in the ass. 
[00:38:00]  Being fucked in the ass position.  Could you take the fucking ass position?  I'll take the fucking you in the ass position this time around.  I swear I have no recollection of ever wrestling.  So I don't know if I blacked it out or blocked it out.  I have no recollection.  I guess you had to, right?  Yeah, at some point in gym class, it was part of the curriculum.  I remember that dumb square dancing we had to do.  I liked that.  You got to hold hands with girls.  Did you?  I loved it.  I always got the beast. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  We would count off, like, okay, you switch with me.  You switch with me.  But everyone would switch around, then it would fuck up your number, and then you'd have to switch again.  Yeah, yeah.  I had the girl that, she ended up being the president of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.  She was appointed president of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.  But this was before any of the girls had titties, so we didn't know.  Right.  But it was kind of nice.  She was kind of tall and goofy, but, and I remember her very clammy hands when we would 
[00:39:00]  hold hands to do a little square dance stuff.  Right.  And I thought that was really, like, sexy.  We didn't have any of that stuff in gym class.  We didn't have wrestling.  We didn't have dancing.  Well, it would have hurt the poor kids.  I'm sure there's a reason that they came up with to not do it.  Yeah.  Being a child of the 80s, that shit went down.  Yeah?  Where dancing?  Where dancing?  Yeah.  Did you have to wear, like, singlets?  Singlets?  When you wrestle?  No, actually, in swimming, we wore singlets like the 30s. 
[00:39:30]  Swimming?  Because it was the 30s.  We didn't have a pool at our high school.  You didn't have a pool?  No.  Hell no.  Man.  We did do swimming.  Yeah?  Did you have to wear headgear when you wrestled, like the ear protector things?  Not in regular gym class.  The wrestling team did, but I barely was wearing my shorts and school-issued shirt for gym class.  I'd have, like, black socks and my sneakers.  Yeah.  I was not the athlete.  Oh, when you said I barely wore, I was like, you whore.  Yes, I went out there.  So a little too much to wear you. 
[00:40:00]  Skin to win.  I hated shirts and skins, too, when they would play, unless I was shirts, because I hated taking  my shirt off, because I was so emaciated and everything.  Did you have a collapsed chest?  I always felt bad for the collapsed chest guys.  I had little Biafra baby ribs.  That was really...  But...  And so it was like, okay, we're going to do shirts and skins.  Do you guys get on this side, on this side?  It's like, oh no, please don't point at us and say skins.  I bet you they don't do that in school anymore.  Trying to play basketball while you're, like, while you're fucking arm brawing yourself. 
[00:40:30]  That's not like trying to...  I was so shy.  You did dribble and cover your nipples at the same time.  That was the pervy gym teacher.  Yes!  He had a pervy gym teacher.  He made you go shirts and skins.  The other gym teachers would find the fucking...  The red...  What do you call them?  Vests or whatever.  They had to put on over here.  That's right.  They shouldn't have that.  They're not vests, though.  What were they fucking called?  Pinnies.  What?  Pinnies.  Yeah, they were called pennies.  Very good.  We're going to play jocks and cocks today, guys. 
[00:41:00]  You guys wear the jocks.  You guys just cocks out.  How expensive are pennies?  It's pennies.  But if you had a pervy one, he would say, oh, shirts and skins.  Shirts and skins.  The pennies are being washed right now.  We've got to go shirts and skins.  Yeah.  Let me break up this pile.  I'll get in there and help.  Right.  Fucking mo.  There's another football story.  Wow.  The football stories continue.  It's a big football weekend.  Sports spectacular.  We did the thumb up the ass, but the Greg Hardy thing.  That was so fucking funny. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Did you see it?  No, I did not see it.  You know how they go through and they have every guy on the screen at some point in the  game just say what their name is and where they went to college?  Right.  Yeah.  Penn State.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  They pop up from the bottom.  Greg Hardy.  And they left it in for some reason.  He's a player for the Panthers.  He'll probably get fined for doing this, by the way.  Because the NFL doesn't like anything fun.  He gave information that I don't think was factual.  Yeah.  Oh.  And this made him go viral yesterday. 
[00:42:00]  He was trending on the Twitter.  Starla to Lillet.  University of Utah.  Kraken.  Hogwarts.  Thomas Davis.  D.  University of Georgia.  What did he say?  Hogwarts.  He announced that his name was Kraken and he went to school at Hogwarts.  That's funny.  I bet he gets fined for that, though.  No, he won't get fined.  All right.  Good.  He'll do that all the time.  They'll do their, like, nicknames or, you know, their entry school.  Oh, nicknames. 
[00:42:30]  Why don't they mention a college?  Hmm?  Why don't they mention what college?  Who gives a fuck what school they were?  I don't understand why.  People that went to that college give a fuck.  But why, though?  Like, I don't.  Still looking for an important graduate from Geneseo State College.  Oh, boy.  Hogwarts made it before Geneseo State.  Still waiting.  What about Greg O.P. Hughes?  Well, other people have to use that one.  At least I gave them one, maybe.  But I don't get to use any.  That's true.  But this guy, Greg Hardy, Kraken is not the only name he's gone by.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  He's also gone by Charles the Loch Ness Monster Johnson.  That sounds like a dick joke there.  Kawan Minotaur Short.  Uh-huh.  Star Hydra Lutalele.  All right.  This guy likes playing fantasy games, I think.  He's a LARPer.  He's a LARPer.  He probably plays World of Warcraft.  And he probably would have played that fucking stupid game.  Yeah.  This is Carolina's entire defensive line. 
[00:43:30]  This is him giving nicknames to everybody.  Oh.  Together, it says they're Monsters, M-O-N-S-T-R-Z, Inc.  Nice.  He's a little wacky.  He's just a nerd.  He's a nerd.  He's a big nerd.  He's like a big black athletic geek.  With no cred.  All right.  We're going to...  Oh.  But what is the college attraction?  Because they do it in basketball and football.  They don't do it in baseball.  It's pride.  It is a pride thing. 
[00:44:00]  Because we don't watch...  Because we don't play AAA.  We don't really watch college baseball that much.  It's not like we watch college football and college basketball.  College basketball and football are fucking huge.  People love knowing where they came from.  Maybe.  Sense of pride.  A lot of good players came out of there.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People.  Why not baseball, though?  What is it?  Because...  I think you're right.  We don't watch college baseball.  Yeah.  Who the fuck watches that shit?  We don't even...  It's popular.  Huh?  No, I know.  It's like college baseball is nowhere near...  Nobody knows where...  No, no.  You're right.  I'm just wondering why we've chosen basketball and football and not like AAA baseball. 
[00:44:30]  That's a good question.  And baseball, except for the fact that the kids start a lot earlier.  They're used to anyway, right?  They would go right from high school to a minor league program if they're really damn...  Yeah, sometimes.  ...really good.  Maybe because there's so many baseball games, too, that you just didn't know how much we're  going to watch.  Yeah, who cares, right?  All right.  We're going to break.  Eight o'clock.  Bill Burr calls back.  Bill A.  From somewhere.  He's in the middle of his European tour.  Amsterdam, I think.  Did you get your...  No, he's out of Amsterdam, Jimmy.  He's moved on to somewhere else.  Wasn't he going to be in Amsterdam today or no? 
[00:45:00]  Am I wrong?  No, I thought he said, by Monday, I'll call you from Amsterdam.  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  Did you get your 3 a.m. text from Bill Burr?  I did, yes.  I did, too.  About the Patrice Bennett.  It's going to set up tomorrow, right?  What?  Today.  Today at 11.  Today at 11.  Today, I got the whole lineup in front of me, but I guess we can't announce it until  Bill Burr calls.  I remember saying...  It's a great lineup.  Bill's going to call at 8 to announce it officially, but tickets do go on sale today at 11 a.m.  I'm like, who the fuck is texting me at this hour? 
[00:45:30]  And there's Billy Burr.  Yeah, my phone's off.  I can't turn my phone off.  My phone's off, too.  I saw it this morning.  It's just to say when it is.  It is...  February 18th.  Yes.  Tuesday.  So, don't worry.  Bill Burr will have all the...  Oh, yeah.  Everything you need to know.  But I'll tell you this much.  This thing will sell out immediately.  So, if you...  Oh, yeah.  If you really have an inkling of doing this, make sure you get on the phone right at 11 a.m.  today, okay?  All right.  Yeah.  And then Jay has to add this, and then we can fucking eat some food. 
[00:46:00]  Jay in New Hampshire.  Jay.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Most baseball players don't even go to college.  That's why they don't bother announcing it.  They go straight from high school ball.  Yeah, baseball ball.  That's what I was saying.  More than any college sport, they go right from high school to a minor league program.  Bunch of dummies.  What's the reason they do that?  You think there's less likelihood of them to get hurt than a football player?  Nah, it's just because there's so many different levels of pro ball.  All single A, double A.  Oh, right.  They can make a living right off the bat.  Okay.  Single, double, triple, and then hopefully the majors. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you.  Yeah.  Although some of these guys, you know, will skip one of those.  Yeah, you don't necessarily have to go right into the majors.  That's almost like your college.  It's a pocket money.  Yeah.  I feel sorry for the college athlete.  They get fucked over.  College gets millions of dollars.  Millions.  And then you learn that these guys can't even, like, a lot of them can't even fly home for  the holidays and stuff because, you know, they would get the money illegally, technically,  and their families can't afford to fly them home.  Which is horrible because, like Jimmy said, they make hundreds of millions of dollars off 
[00:47:00]  these guys.  And most of them don't even make it into the fucking pros to actually make money off their  talent.  Is that what boosters are?  Are there, like, people that are used, ex-alumni or alumni of the college that buy shit for  the players that this university can't?  Yeah, I guess it's a bit of a wraparound.  I don't know what that was.  A workaround, I should say.  A little bit of a workaround.  It's illegal, though, but they get caught.  Right.  I think.  Right, but Jesus.  These guys, they end up, they can't even buy food to eat.  They're starving their asses off.  Help me out here, Hendry. 
[00:47:30]  Exactly.  I'm trying to get on this flight.  Yeah.  We'll return after these messages.  Travis is throwing his hands up.  You did this for Jimmy, and Jimmy just ran to the bathroom.  Ran out with his little hummingbird bladder.  We didn't have ten minutes to break.  He went out to go shit that white shit piss on someone's windshield. 
[00:48:00]  You guys can tell him about it when he comes to it.  Yeah.  Hell no.  He loses.  This is kind of cool, actually.  I like it because it sounds old school.  It sounds fuzzy.  Yeah.  It's fuzzy.  Right.  Black Sabbath dominates rock categories with three nominations for the Grammys.  Jay-Z leads with nine.  Nine times.  Nine times.  For that fucking hack. 
[00:48:30]  Piece of shit.  Jay-Z.  How's he doing with his clothes and Barneys?  Oh, he's not.  Huh?  He's still doing just fine.  He's doing just fine.  Oh, hey, nah.  Oh, hey, nah.  Uh-huh.  I like that whole situation because Reverend Al had to just walk away.  Yeah.  Because if you don't have Jay-Z on your side, then why bother?  You're fucked.  I am out.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't get to Jay-Z.  Jay-Z basically said, stand down. 
[00:49:00]  Stand down, Reverend Al.  You know who's not going to be happy about Jay-Z's nine nominations?  The who?  The who kid?  No.  He'll be fine with it.  Who?  Kanye and his two nominations.  Well, Kanye said he's the new Nelson Mandela, so.  No, he didn't.  Is he?  I think so.  No.  No, he didn't.  No, he did say that.  He's old and sick.  I believe everything I read.  Well, Paris Hilton also tweeted that Nelson Mandela gave the I Have a Dream speech.  Well, that's not too far-fetched. 
[00:49:30]  I know, right?  It's like, it could have happened.  We got a Paris Hilton fucking J-Lo thing happening.  You want to throw the ball around a little bit?  Where are the girls?  J-Lo.  I guess Lindsay Lohan had Paris.  Lilo.  Just call her Lilo.  We'll know who we're talking about.  Lilo?  Yeah.  Lindsay Lohan.  Lilo.  I guess she had Paris Hilton's brother beat up at a party.  Really?  It's good to see that Lohan's doing well. 
[00:50:00]  I've heard conflicting reports that she had something to do with that and that she had  nothing to do with that.  People are saying that Lindsay Lohan is still doing some of that partying, even though the  Oprah is on her side.  She is one freckled bitch.  Yeah, I never liked the freckled.  I wasn't a fan of the freckled bitches.  She's got the all over freckles, you know?  Like, you'll be licking freckled pussy, you'll go down on her.  Definitely.  It's not just her face or her shoulders.  It's the freckled cleavage that drives me nuts. 
[00:50:30]  It starts looking like an apple.  No, a little bit's fine, but when it starts to get ridiculously over the top, like you've  got something spreading, it starts looking like an alligator thing or something.  The freckles start getting darker and more pronounced.  Oh, boy.  No, I don't like that.  I don't mind it, but I can't take too, too much.  A little freckles.  A little here and there.  A little freckles, yeah.  A little freckle.  Wow, look at that.  He's a little beat up.  Yeah.  Looks like claw mark.  What's his dumb name?  Baron. 
[00:51:00]  Baron Hilton.  Baron Hilton.  What a rich name.  Baron Von Hilton.  Ugh.  Look at this fucking kid.  He looks like a douchebag.  I'm sorry.  Of course he does.  I don't know him from a hole in the wall.  He looks like a douchebag.  Yeah, if it was a hole in the wall, you'd know him because your mouth would be around  just a little bit.  He looks pretty good right there.  Yeah.  I don't know him from a hole in the rest area.  He looks all right all beaten up, though.  Yeah, he does.  Lindsay Lohan's thug beat my face up. 
[00:51:30]  And he said, do you know who I am?  Do you know who my sisters are?  Ugh.  He really looks like a douchebag.  That looks like someone clawed his face and went down each side of his nose.  It doesn't look like a punch.  He said he was hit with an unknown object.  Oh, really?  Yeah, a cock.  Well, I hope Paris Hilton doesn't get on the warpath.  You don't want her mad at you.  Boy, look out.  Jerk.  A couple things.  I put my Twitter up here, old school. 
[00:52:00]  And I was sort of accurate with the Warren Moon, by the way.  Yeah?  Yeah, there was some domestic abuse charges.  A little domestic?  15 years ago.  With a gun?  I don't know if there was a gun.  I feel like there was a gun involved with Warren Moon.  You had him pulling off the Brinks job.  Coz, C-O-S-Z on the Twitter, says Warren Moon beat up his wife about 15 years ago.  That's what you were thinking of.  Okay.  And then we got this guy that says, you got to look up Stink. 
[00:52:30]  Mark Schlourisho pops up.  Do you know this guy, Mark Schlourith?  I think that's how you pronounce it.  S-C-H-L-E-R-E-T-H.  They used to call him Stink, and I want to see if this is true, by Nix Hex on Twitter.  They nicknamed him Stink because he used to piss and shit himself on purpose in the pileup.  All right, that's crazy.  Tyson Walter told us some things, man, where these guys get disgusting before some of these games. 
[00:53:00]  He's saying he didn't do it.  Right?  They're saying it's not true.  They're already saying it's not true?  Well, he's not going to admit to it that he actually fucking shits.  No, the title is Rumors We Wish Were True, but aren't.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that was the name of the heading that Sam's looking under.  I bet you it's based on something.  I bet you he lets a nugget or two go during a game.  His nickname is...  Just to make him miserable for everyone?  Maybe it happened by accident.  Maybe somebody fucking hit him one time, and he just fucking sharded or something.  Well, didn't Tony, uh... 
[00:53:30]  How do you say it?  Tony, uh...  Saragusa, right?  Yeah.  Tony Saragusa!  Didn't he tell a wonderful story about, like, duct-taping his cheeks together so he wouldn't  shit on the field?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now he's, you know, in the man cave making sure people don't piss themselves.  Use your maxi pads, guys.  What's his nickname, Sam?  His nickname is Stink, but...  Okay, so it's based on something.  Yeah, it's based on that he's Alaskan, and he was talking to his teammates about a dish 
[00:54:00]  called Stink Head, which is made from the whole head of a king salmon.  Oh, my God.  That sounds awful.  And it's prepared by wrapping the head in the long grasses that grow along the rivers  and streams.  Wrap your fucking head in the grasses.  You hear how they make it sound like, ooh, how they explain some of these dishes in a  restaurant?  It's still a fucking salmon head.  And then they bury it in a moss-lined pit in the ground for four to six weeks where it  rots. 
[00:54:30]  Uh-huh.  And then the bones soften up until the whole head has a consistency of mashed potatoes.  I've heard about this.  I saw this on some TV show, and it really, like, people were eating it.  Yeah.  And the native people that can eat this were...  Gobbling it down.  But everybody else was just, like, literally gagging.  It sounds disgusting.  It sounds horrendous.  A rotted fish head.  Why would you eat that?  Why wouldn't?  You're starving, I would think.  You're walking along the mossy edge of a river, you find a fish head, and you eat it because 
[00:55:00]  you're starving.  And then what?  Decide it's a delicacy.  Okay, now it's saying that he says, I was telling them about Stinkhead, the meal, and  it just so happened that I regularly peed my pants.  Which he said...  During games?  Pretty much every game I did, I was already drenched in sweat, so it was no real difference  to me.  Oh, he would just do it probably, like, just to do it because they'd go in the locker room. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, that's cool.  I was miserable, anyhow, on the field.  I wasn't going to hold it in and become even more miserable.  So, yeah, he talked...  I would assume a lot of guys just pee in their pants.  Yeah, by the second quarter, you're like, fuck it.  Right.  But, yeah, he did...  Yeah, so it was half that he talked about Stinkhead, the Alaskan dish, and half because  he always pissed his pants.  But I bet you they could also get a good swamp ass going.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Well, you make everyone miserable.  Save that for the Super Bowl.  You make them miserable in that fucking huddle. 
[00:56:00]  Can't do that every week.  In the pileups.  Yeah.  Dick Butkus or whatever, who was that used to spit on the ball?  When this...  He'd be...  He'd be fucking...  He'd be...  I guess whatever the fucking defensive lineman position is.  And he'd be right over the ball just before the hike.  Just spitting on the ball so the guy had to fucking touch the ball.  No way, really?  Yeah.  So the fucking center had to hold it with his spit on the ass.  Wouldn't that start a fight, though?  I don't know why you would put up with that.  Because he's Dick Butkus.  I mean, maybe nobody wanted to take a swing at him, but that was... 
[00:56:30]  I'm sure other guys do stuff like that.  Dick Butkus.  And also, I saw my picture on Twitter last night.  I thought it was fake, and I guess it's not.  The hockey player that took the skate to the face?  Ow.  Travis, do you know that one, too?  No, I don't.  I saw a picture that was horrendous.  And I just thought it was photoshopped.  God damn it!  That's not the one I saw, so I guess...  That's a bad one, though.  So I guess...  Oof.  They were...  Is that from last...  There you go.  Over the weekend?  Yeah, this.  Watch this. 
[00:57:00]  Holy fuck, I didn't think this was real.  It's so fucked up.  Oh, come on.  That's cool, man.  I didn't think that was real.  That looks like sci-fi makeup.  Yeah, it's a gash.  I thought someone was just fucking around with some photoshop.  There's a guy in front of him going, ah!  He's looking at the side going, ah!  Oh, that's his entire cheek is ripped open.  It looks like it's ripped right open into his mouth on the side.  It's from his earlobe across to his nostril, basically.  Those skates are pretty dangerous.  Fuck, yeah, man. 
[00:57:30]  Holy fuck, it is real.  They should make it like kind of rubbery on the bottom so nobody gets hurt.  Soft, like Nerf.  Wow, that's fucking awful.  Okay, and it was in Quebec.  Quebec, minor pro player, suffers a horrifying skate cut to the face.  That's worse if it's the neck, though.  Oh, yeah.  Which did happen in a game.  Yeah, I saw that one.  But it was a stick, though.  Was that a skate, too, or a stick?  Yeah, it was a skate right to the jugular, man.  He almost bled out right in front of everybody.  Un-fucking-believable.  That is one of the most horrific things you could see in sports, is that clip. 
[00:58:00]  Wow, his fucking mouth.  Did they explain how many stitches it took to fucking get this guy back together?  He could eat through the side of his mouth.  Oh, man, the face on the other guy is just amazing.  Yeah, he's like, holy shit, this is a horror film.  Yeah.  They don't have any...  I guess it took a stitch or two.  No big deal.  Yeah, that's it.  A little crazy glue.  Oh, he writes, uh, and hashtag is, uh, in there. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's French.  All right, now we got it.  I speak French.  We got it.  All right.  Did you see the, uh, the fucking Bigfoot-Silva-Mark Hunt fight?  No.  Oh, my fucking God.  One of the best heavyweight fights in UFC I've ever seen in my life.  What a bloody fucking bash fest that was.  Five rounds.  Oh, I didn't see it.  And it was a draw.  It's the only time I've ever been happy to see a draw. 
[00:59:00]  No, it was the right move.  You guys beat the shit out of each other for a draw.  You couldn't pick a winner.  Were both guys happy it was a draw?  Everyone was.  Every single person watching it was happy it was a draw.  Right.  Because you watch these guys slugging each other, and you're like, you can't, neither  one of these guys lost this fight.  Damn.  I was happy.  It was one guy who gave Mark Hunt the win by one...  Mike Hunt?  Oh.  Like 47, 46, whatever.  And then the other two judges said it was a draw, so I was very happy.  Very cool.  Let me say hi to Tom in New Jersey. 
[00:59:30]  Tom?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Tommy!  What's up, Tommy?  Hey, yeah.  So, a couple guys that took NHL's gateways from the face.  One of them is Richard Zetnick.  It was a couple years ago.  He was playing for the Panthers.  The trainer had to come out and pinch his artery in his neck to keep it closed.  Pinched the artery.  Pinched the artery.  Just squeezing the artery so the guy doesn't bleed out.  Jesus.  Yeah.  I know it was last year or two years ago, a young kid, Taylor Hall. 
[01:00:00]  That's a pretty gruesome picture.  I don't know if you saw that one.  No, let's look it up.  Who was it again?  Taylor Hall and Edmonton Oilers.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Poor, uh, poor Baron.  Yeah, I know.  I feel bad for Baron.  Baron.  He's had a rough life.  Baron Hilton.  Just a very tough life.  What a fucking...  Ugh.  You think he's a spoiled brat?  Oh, is he ever.  Where do you take it?  Right in the head. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, right there.  Wow.  He blackened his eyes.  He took out his brain.  That's what it looks like.  I can't do the impression.  That's him right there.  You cut out his brain, you bloody baboon.  Not only can I not do the impression, I don't even get it right.  Oh, it's fine.  I didn't get the words right.  I can do that impression pretty.  Cut out his brain, you damn baboon.  Thank you, Tom.  Good impression.  You have a good weekend there?  I'm glad to hear.  All right.  Yep.  Bye. 
[01:01:00]  Bye, Tommy.  Tommy.  I think that's it for sports, finally.  We're good at sports.  No, that's quite the wrap-up.  Some people think we suck at sports.  I think we're terrific at sports.  Oh, we're your everyman.  I think we're pretty good.  Just give them the basics.  That's it.  Eventually, because we get it.  What, are we going to throw stats out there?  Come on.  Yeah.  Don't do that shit.  You know who thinks we're good at sports?  People that don't watch sports.  Right.  Well, those are the people we're talking to.  Yeah.  Everyone else already knows all this shit.  I'm amazed every day.  How do you guys know all this stuff? 
[01:01:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Sam.  Fucking crazy.  And I always get it wrong.  Right.  Well, we find the right information.  I tapped out on the Jets and Geno Smith, and then the Jets, well, they were playing the Raiders.  Fuck it.  I'm going to stick to what I think.  Geno Smith stinks.  Is Sanchez hurt, or they just benched him?  Yeah, he's hurt.  Sold the shit.  Very injured.  They're hoping to move on with this Geno Smith, but we'll see.  They sort of have moved on with him, but.  Yeah.  Yeah, no one's really talking about anyone else. 
[01:02:00]  And why are they shooting at white owls at JFK?  Because they're fucking.  I haven't heard of one problem with the white owls.  One got sucked into an engine.  One got sucked into an engine.  And sitting there on the sign.  It wasn't causing a problem, but the engine just sucked it in.  See, this is how we think, though.  The Canadian geese kill those fuckers all day long.  I don't give a fuck.  But the white owl.  Look at how fucking great that looks.  Hey, it's beautiful.  You know what the dumbest thing ever with JFK is?  It's built on a bird sanctuary. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  And that's not even a joke.  It's built on the fucking bird sanctuary down there.  So they have all these weird exotic-y birds that are protected.  Mm-hmm.  And then they either kill them or they fly into jet engines.  And then they get these massive jet engines just in the sky constantly.  That's got to be a nightmare for birds.  Imagine walking down the fucking...  They must be pretty stressed out.  Every day you walk down the sidewalk and occasionally a giant fucking human-sized blender just comes down the street. 
[01:03:00]  Comes flying from...  Hacks you up.  Comes flying from an angle you don't know.  And you've got to go, whoa!  You've got to avoid it.  Right.  That's what these birds have to deal with.  It's their lives.  Crazy.  I guess we were stupid to build the airport on a bird sanctuary.  I'm sure they didn't think, you know.  I didn't know they were shooting at white owls.  I didn't even know we had white owls over there.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's plenty somewhere else.  That's what I think about wildlife.  Like, ah, we can't build there because there's a spotted owl or the fucking falcon or some shit. 
[01:03:30]  It's like, ah, there's somewhere else they've got to build.  Well, hopefully.  So what are they doing?  They're allowed to shoot them over there?  They've got a program?  Yeah.  Buckshire, he's birdshot.  There's guys that have snipers or whatever that do it.  That'd be a great gig, right?  Yeah.  To just sit there shooting birds all day?  The snowy owl, it's called.  Yeah.  There's the white one there.  Yeah, of course.  The Canadian geese.  Go fuck yourself.  There's plenty of those.  Oh, go around.  Yeah, how about they see the giant planes and move? 
[01:04:00]  That's like giant birds to them.  Why would you fly around a bird that big anyway, you dumb cocks?  Deserve to get shot.  It never flaps its wings.  That is a good point.  If you saw like a giant human walking down the sidewalk, you wouldn't go anywhere near that.  I'd ask why he's off today.  I don't think it's tall, but that works too.  That works, giant.  Should we call E-Rock and make sure he's all right?  Yeah, I guess so.  He seemed a little wild at his party.  That was a bash.  It was a bash.  This guy has a comment. 
[01:04:30]  What?  It started a little slow.  Go tell your friends.  What's up, Daniel?  Hi.  I think it was in 1998.  There was this huge Michael Renberg of the Philadelphia Flyers.  He took a skate to the face.  They cut him from his chin all the way up to his forehead.  It looked like toothpaste.  They had, I think it was like 128 stitches in his face.  It was not looking at the picture.  That's, that is nuts.  Let's see what I want.  You got that one?  Battleheart.  What's his? 
[01:05:00]  Oh, he's gone.  Michael Rembert?  Is that what he said?  Rembert.  Rembert.  I didn't hear the name.  You started the phone call with, this guy's got a comment.  What the, why don't you go call one of your fucking friends?  Oh, that went out over the air?  Yeah, it's not welcoming.  It's Monday.  Just be able to keep those things in my head.  Yeah, no, we should appreciate the callers.  Encourage them to call in.  It's mind-boggling to me that these people call us. 
[01:05:30]  Why?  I don't know.  It's so strange.  Aren't we just talking to each other?  No.  Mind your own business out there.  Why was there a Bud Light fucking bottle cap here?  Who's drinking Bud Light in here?  Oh, whoops.  Maybe a weekend.  My secret's out.  I heard Ron and Fez said nice stuff about us, too.  Yes, they did.  Really nice stuff.  Ooh.  Ron, he's the real deal, man.  He's a stand-up guy.  He's the real fucking deal.  Yeah.  Always has been.  They're moving over to Raw Dog. 
[01:06:00]  You kidding?  Do we have any of their announcement or anything?  After the holidays.  Yeah.  After the holidays?  After the holidays, they go to Raw Dog.  I think they're doing noon to three.  Fezzy says he's back.  And better than ever?  Well, he had a nervous breakdown two days prior, but now he's back.  A nervous breakdown.  I'm happy he's back.  He was able to figure it out.  Lickety split.  I was listening.  He had some crazy energy on Friday, although two days prior, he was pretty much a puddle 
[01:06:30]  of human emotions.  Did you see Mrs. Fields' Twitter?  Yeah, she loved it, right?  Well, I don't know if it's actually her.  Yeah, it's probably someone who works for her company.  Who's Mrs. Fields?  Sally.  Oh.  Sally's making cookies these days.  Gotcha.  Yeah, it's like the greatest thing that could happen to Mrs. Fields' cookies.  Yeah, last week, maybe Thursday or Friday, they tweeted out something that just said, 
[01:07:00]  our products typically bring tears of joy.  Awkward.  Hashtag Ron and Fez.  That's pretty funny to address it.  At least companies, how many followers do they have?  I'm trying to talk to you, Sam.  No, you don't care how many followers.  I actually want to see who follows.  Maybe just grab Sam's hand.  They have 7,300 followers.  That's it?  That's a lot of people to follow cookies.  Follow a cookie.  What could it say?  Yeah, true.  Because it's a product.  Hi, I'm delicious.  Okay, I'll follow you.  Product accounts don't do well in general. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, but they're all trying to change it.  Like, have you seen DiGiorno's is trying to be like the new internet meme Twitter account?  Ew, what are they doing?  Well, first they started...  I'm going to follow one food account.  What's DiGiorno's?  I'm telling you.  Why would you follow a Twitter account of like a pizza company or something?  Because they started tweeting out little like funny little anecdotes.  Oh, let's hear it.  And then what really put them over the top was they live tweeted NBC's Sound of Music special. 
[01:08:00]  Was it Carrie Underwood?  And so everybody's like...  She's getting killed for that.  It was not a good...  It was very bad.  I hear her singing was great, but her acting stinks.  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah, it was...  What did they do with live?  Broadway-type acting?  Yeah, they did it live, I guess, because that's now...  That's the big gimmick.  And they didn't do it with an audience, though.  Yeah.  So like after the songs, there's no applause and the jokes, there's no laughing, and it's  like you're just kind of watching and it just sits there.  They're killing her, even though 18 million people saw it. 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  It did really well.  18 million saw it.  I saw like during, I guess, the Thanksgiving Day parade, they had a preview of it.  They were showing some of the rehearsals and whatnot.  She sounds good.  She's a great singer.  And it was very Broadway-ish, you know, it's...  But Sound of Music had great sets, too, right?  Oh.  And they threw this together and it made it look sort of like a play.  It was supposed to look like the play and not like the movie.  Do you know my favorite...  Oh, that was what they...  Yeah, they said this is live.  Yeah, but most people aren't going to look at it that way.  They're going to go, wow, the original Sound of Music looked beautiful on the big screen 
[01:09:00]  and this looks like shit.  Yeah, it's kind of hard live to spin on a big mountaintop and sing The Hills Are Alive.  Yeah, you didn't say it right.  What?  The Hills Are Alive with the sound of music.  Nice.  Odabanga!  I love you.  Odabanga!  People said they've been walking around screaming that for fucking three days.  I see people tweeting it.  That's crazy.  Nobody's going to be able to watch Scarface again, that scene.  No. 
[01:09:30]  Odabanga!  I can't tell you this name was supposed to be Odabanga.  Could you get that D, Giorno's...  Yeah, I got it.  Oh, so they live tweeted, did they say anything like,  wow, she looks like she's got a meaty pussy, like our meaty meat pizza or anything?  No.  They said, I don't know.  I'm going to make it dirty.  Believe it or not, they did not.  They wrote things like, hashtag the Sound of Music Live.  I can't believe pizza isn't one of her favorite things, SMH.  No.  Shake my head.  Suck my hemorrhoid up. 
[01:10:00]  Incorrect.  They, they, did they add pizza into everything they...  Um, dough, ray, me, equals pizza party with me and a guy named Ray.  Dough, ray, me.  Yeah, chip, the Giornio, or whatever.  And then they went even, they went even further.  Oh, God.  Dough, a crust, an unbaked crust.  Ray, a guy that likes pizza.  Me, a pizza liked by a guy named Ray. 
[01:10:30]  Ray, fa, no idea what fa is.  So, so, la, a city.  How many fucking characters did they get?  Please stop.  That is a terrible idea.  They're trying to make it clever and funny.  It was not, it was not funny, but it was not a terrible idea.  Well, 18 million people watched it, so there's a lot of dopes out there.  And everybody's like, oh, look at this, a pizza is talking about Sound of Music.  Yeah.  Peace. 
[01:11:00]  This is fun.  Look at this pizza talking about Sound of Music.  Follow that pizza.  They should do it like fucking, like go to the hockey game.  Like, oh, look, speaking of a slice, look at the mark on his face from the skate.  Yeah, it's just throwing pizza references everywhere.  How many followers they got?  Did it work?  43,000 something.  That's better for food accounts.  45,000.  That's all right.  45,000 more than they should have.  Exactly.  Want to go back to hockey injuries?  Because I just got turned on to a fucking site here.  Bleacher Report.  I know BleacherReport.com has the 50 most gruesome injuries in hockey history. 
[01:11:30]  Could you go there now, Sam?  Yes.  Someone just tweeted it on my account, or you could just maybe try to find it on the Bleacher Report website.  Put in 50 most gruesome.  See what comes up.  Most gruesome.  Yeah, the first picture is terrific.  Oh, yeah.  While Sam's finding that, did you guys see the SpaghettiOs tweet?  Since we're talking about the tweet.  Yeah, that SpaghettiOs got in a little bit of trouble.  Yeah, it wasn't good. 
[01:12:00]  For tweeting about Pearl Harbor Day.  What did they say?  It was so stupid.  It was just like, hey, we want to, you know.  Like, join us in remembering.  Join us in remembering.  And it had a SpaghettiO.  The graphic was the SpaghettiO holding an American flag.  And they got in trouble for that?  Yeah, I guess people thought it was like.  He was smiling and licking his lips.  Yeah, come on, SpaghettiO.  What are you doing?  Yeah, like, what are you so happy about?  Yeah.  Nobody wants pasta.  But it's like, it was so harmless.  He's trying to get some of that DiGiorno heat. 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  But nobody wants to see a SpaghettiO tweet.  Everybody wants to know what the pizza's thinking.  No, no one cared.  Yeah.  So, uh.  All right, what do we got?  50 most gruesome injuries in hockey history.  Let's try this.  This is Rafi Torres slams Marion Hossa.  Are they all videos?  Yeah.  This could take forever.  I can't see it.  I was just thinking that.  I can't see it.  I thought it was just quick pictures of the actual injuries.  And generally speaking, I like a nice top.  It's not a montage? 
[01:13:00]  A nice top ten list.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, there's 50 videos to watch.  It's like homework.  All right, let's start with number 50.  Why are we starting with 50?  Can't we start with, like, number eight and work our way to one?  Why?  It's Monday, you idiot.  Oh, God.  We can't watch.  It's called Eat Up the Time.  Let's talk about DiGiorno, then.  Well, you know it's Monday because Eric's not here.  Yes.  He's taking a day of leisure.  Yeah, sure.  Nice little wraparound weekend.  I'd be taking Mondays for the foreseeable future. 
[01:13:30]  He needs a buffer.  We could listen to Ron and Fez complimenting us.  We could read more DiGiorno tweets.  There's lots of things we could do besides watching 50 hockey videos.  Yeah, we'll have an announcement of what's going to happen with this channel and their  time slot, I don't know, later.  Today?  I don't know, whenever.  I'm interested.  Maybe, like, after the holiday or something.  What?  That's when it's supposed to happen, though.  Yeah, I know.  Just let it happen, and then people go, ooh, oh, I see what they're doing. 
[01:14:00]  Why make it a whole thing?  Because it's a thing.  What?  It's like a channel, you know, thing.  It's a relaunch.  Yeah.  With new things.  So let the new things happen, and then, you know, people go, oh, wow, okay, I see what's  going on here.  You could never, like, put yourself on a pedestal.  Why do we have to do it like everyone else?  Let the show business happen.  Just let the thing happen, and then people go, oh, okay, I see.  Same show, though, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  People keep fucking yapping on Twitter. 
[01:14:30]  So, Anthony, what are you doing?  Shut up.  What are you doing?  Shut up.  What are you mad about?  I don't know.  What'd they do?  There's a bit of a buzz out there.  Why are you upset that Ron and Fez have created a buzz for this channel?  No, because they're asking questions.  There's a bit of a buzz out there.  They're all nosy, busybodies.  Something's got to take over for Ron and Fez, so there's a bit of a buzz.  They're trying to figure it out.  See?  So we got something going on.  Figure it out.  Yeah, but Kid Chris actually had to say he's not coming to the channel.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then some dude named... 
[01:15:00]  Big News!  Big News on the Horizon!  A lot of people think it might be Scorch coming to the channel.  Big News on the Horizon!  Some guy named Chad Dukes said he loves me.  And you were like...  Big Island Dukes are great.  I don't know those guys.  You did.  Those guys are great.  No, I don't know them.  You met them, I think.  No, I've never met them.  You don't think so?  Nope.  Ouch.  I don't know who they are.  Can we start with number 50?  Okay.  Maybe we can do random numbers.  Yes.  Two.  Let's start with one.  And then one.  All right. 
[01:15:30]  This is Rafi Torres slams Marion Hossa in the 2012 playoffs.  Because Hossa said so?  Is this going to be as impressive as number one?  Number 50?  I would think it would be 50 times less impressive.  Okay.  Right.  They're all on the ice.  They're skating.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  They bumped into each other.  The guy fell.  Now they're still skating on the other side. 
[01:16:00]  I didn't see what happened.  They bumped into each other.  Okay.  Let's go to number five.  That's definitely 50.  Okay.  Here.  That sucked.  We're seeing where we're starting and we're jumping to five?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to five.  Yeah.  That sucked.  How do you go to five?  How do you go to five?  All I got is my skates and my stick.  All I got is my skates and my sticks and my bolts.  Uh-oh.  And I don't break it up for nobody.  There you go.  Ah.  It worked.  It should be around number, somewhere around number five. 
[01:16:30]  This will be six.  47 will be six.  Out of 52?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  It's just, but I wanted five.  It's like math.  So you should have put 48 in.  That would have been five.  No.  Oh, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.  Oh.  But we'll stick with 47, which is six.  Everyone knows.  It's like a pop quiz.  It's true, though.  Oh, Islanders.  Nice.  Oh, should I read what it is?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Danielle Paley takes a slap shot to the face. 
[01:17:00]  Ow!  Is that something you'd like to see?  Yeah, I remember this, actually.  Okay.  This is brutal.  Sitting there, wasn't it, Pierre?  Oh, look out!  Oh, Danny Pye just got him right in the face.  He's down.  Steven Stale shot and got him right in the face.  Wow.  Sliding out to block that shot.  He took it right on the fucking face.  And it's almost the same spot where Steven Stamkos got in the face last year for Tampa and the  Tampa Boston points.  Why don't they just wear a giant fucking face-covering helmet?  Most of them are.  Most of them got the protection now.  Boy, this happened so fast.  What's annoying is that this stupid list isn't just showing the moment. 
[01:17:30]  They're not going to play much, but it's a dangerous part of the occupation.  This one just gets right away from Stales, and there's nothing, absolutely nothing, that  Danny Pye can do.  He has a shield on, too, Mike.  Totally unexpected.  Oh, he has a shield on.  Turn of events.  Panty shield.  We can only keep our fingers crossed.  Like Captain America.  Yeah, he died.  All right, let's move on to the next one.  He did?  Yep.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  Whoa, he's still playing.  Oh, and the video's not there.  What's happening?  Oh, man.  That was crazy.  We might have to give up on this bit.  Yeah, I was...  Let's go right to number one.  Yeah, please.  Because we're already sounding like number two.  What is this one?  Scott Stevens nails Lindros.  Oh, that's hot.  Eric Lindros.  Yeah.  One would assume.  Yeah.  This clip is four minutes long.  All right.  That's good.  If you ever put this clip list together, fucking show just the moment. 
[01:18:30]  Really quickly, too.  Yeah, like a slow motion.  One after another.  They probably didn't upload all the clips themselves.  I know.  So they could have made a little montage video?  Those are easy to make.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the question.  Oh, boy.  Move that arrow, Sam.  He's bumped.  All right.  They're playing hockey.  They're on the skates.  The guy took it.  He's going the other way.  Oh, he fell down.  He punched him in the face. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  This ain't worse.  I think he punched him in the face.  Yeah.  What's number one?  We can't even go.  I just got a number one.  It's got to be the fucking neck, right?  I'm thinking.  Okay.  Number one.  Clint Malarchuk's neck slice.  Yep.  This is the number one.  Yeah.  We haven't seen this in a while.  It has been taken down.  YouTube will not allow you to see that.  You know the shit you can see on YouTube now? 
[01:19:30]  Yep.  Number one one is taken down.  Yeah.  We don't have it.  Too gruesome.  It will not allow that one?  Multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement.  That's an NHL issue.  NHL.  They don't want that out there.  Yeah, they don't want that out there.  It's better for their sport, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Neck slicing.  Kids want to, you know.  Watch hockey.  Watch the game, and they're seeing people get their throats slit.  You missed Ozzy, Jimmy, because you were in the bathroom.  Black Sabbath nominated.  Three Grammys.  Three Grammys. 
[01:20:00]  Best.  In the rock category, though.  I know.  There's no other rock out there right now.  Best metal.  Jethro Tull.  True.  Best rock performance for God is Dead.  I want to say best rock song for God is Dead.  Who else was nominated?  Reading the list, you wouldn't think it's 2013.  I'll be honest.  It's Led Zeppelin.  Zeppelin's got something.  There's McCartney did something.  What do you mean Zeppelin's got something?  For Celebration Day.  Queen of the Stone Age.  That record counts.  I guarantee they give it to fucking Zeppelin or something.  This is new music.  Best rock performance. 
[01:20:30]  What's going on with Zeppelin?  They did a live performance, I guess, what was it, two years ago?  Yeah, and then they released it on CD last year.  There's no way that should win a fucking Grammy.  They won't.  I mean, they got a few rock bands.  Like what?  Queen of the Stone Age.  They have Alabama Shakes.  Have you heard Alabama Shakes?  I like the Alabama Shakes.  They're amazing.  Give me a little Alabama Shakes.  What was their big song?  I don't know.  I'm shaking.  Big song.  Big song.  I think Hold On was big, right?  Always All Right is their nominated song.  Yeah, let's do Always All Right.  Just a little taste of the Alabama Shakes. 
[01:21:00]  While we're waiting for that.  The Stars Are Out Tonight by David Bowie.  Radioactive by Imagine Dragons.  That was a huge song this year.  I love that dumb song.  I'm radioactive.  Radioactive.  Led Zeppelin's Cashmere.  Right.  My God is the Sun by Queens of the Stone Age.  And I'm Shaken by Jack White.  Oh, I gotta go with Jack White.  I'm sorry.  Love the Jack White.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Stiff competition.  Love the Jack White.  Well, that's not listed in that category. 
[01:21:30]  That's Best Rock.  Best Metal is where Black Sabbath is listed.  Oh, okay.  There's...  And that's got Anthrax, Sabbath, Dream Theater, Kill Switch and Gage.  Dream Theater?  Dream Theater?  Where the fuck have they been hiding?  Oh, my God.  In the Metal category.  Ah, okay.  I bet you if we play The Enemy Inside by Dream Theater, it'll sound like every other fucking  thing they've ever done.  Of course it will.  God, I hate Dream Theater.  Joe DeRosa likes Dream Theater.  Does he?  Is that the one?  Or Queen's Theater?  Is that what it is?  I don't know.  I'm so happy they got nominated. 
[01:22:00]  And they got nominated for Best Rock Song as well.  Best Rock Song?  What are the best rock songs?  Panic Station by Muse, God is Dead, Black Sabbath, Doom and Gloom, Rolling Stones.  Doom and Gloom.  Cut Me Some Slack, which is from Sound City.  McCartney and Groll.  McCartney and Groll.  And Ain't Messin' Around by Gary Clark Jr.  That's a tough category because you're up against the Stones or McCartney and Groll. 
[01:22:30]  One of those two, yeah.  Well, McCartney and Groll together.  What do you want to play?  Alabama Shakes?  I like Alabama Shakes.  If you want that song, Sam's going to have to play it from YouTube.  I don't have it in here.  Oh, shit.  I have Hold On, but I don't have...  Well, let's play Hold On.  All right.  A little bit of Hold On.  Yeah.  Oh, you know these guys.  Yeah?  He might not.  Yeah.  They opened for Jack White.  Both acts were very good.  The lead singer's fantastic. 
[01:23:00]  Good so far.  Well, let's give it some...  All right.  Trying to be Jack White.  I don't want to show you a photo because you made pre-judge.  Let me pre-judge.  It sounds like fucking Robert Flint.  What is that?  That's the singer.  The woman, right?  Yeah.  Black chick.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  She's good, though.  Really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not God is Dead, but I mean, it's so right.  You prefer Black Sabbath?  A lot.  That's a sort of chick, right?  Yeah.  I mean, she's in the sort of chick category, right?  I wouldn't call her a sex pod, but I think she's a confirmed female.  And there's yours, too. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know where I'm gonna go.  Sounds a bit Jack White.  Oh, my God.  That hipster is a fucking asshole in the band, too.  Wow.  The guy with the red jacket?  The red jacket and the wacky hat and the big, bushy beard.  What's he gonna do?  He's a fat guy.  He's an asshole.  And the other guy has the wacky hat and the beard, too?  Oh, no.  They're just hipster douches.  These fucking hipsters should just be killed.  You can't stand the hipsters.  I'm glad they get a Starbucks over there in fucking Hipster City.  Is that a problem? 
[01:24:30]  I'm sure it will be.  Man, we don't need your Starbucks, man.  We're cool.  And then Best Rock Album.  I am.  13, obviously, by Black Sabbath.  Next Day by David Bowie.  Mechanical Bull by Kings of Leon.  Celebration Day by Led Zeppelin.  Like Clockwork, Queens of the Stone Age.  And Psychedelic Pill, Neil Young with Crazy Horse.  I'm way behind on music. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  It finally happened.  I'm so pumped.  But Rock is not.  I hung in there for a really long time.  Rock is not big anymore.  I don't know any of those fucking albums.  It did, but it's not like it was.  This probably won't even be televised.  I think I know more about the Black Sabbath album because of Jimmy.  I didn't listen to the new Bowie record.  I need this stuff.  I love the new Black Sabbath.  One of the rock categories will be televised, but not all of them.  Yeah, yeah.  Best metal won't be.  No way. 
[01:25:30]  Alternative won't be either.  No.  I'm tired of this already.  Oh, God.  Heard you.  It'll depend on who they give it to and who they can get to go.  Oh, you're right.  If they give it to, like, a Sabbath is there, a Bowie is there, then they'll televise it.  Maybe.  But, you know.  All right.  Yeah, I just thought I'd like to say something.  Any other new songs we want to play today?  Let me see.  Do you know a Jack White song?  I'm shaking.  Yeah, it's great.  I don't know. 
[01:26:00]  How does that go?  Do I know it?  You might.  I'd better.  Have you heard his album?  No.  What are you waiting for?  It's been out forever.  It's called having two fucking kids is what I'm waiting for them to grow up a little bit.  How about that?  You can listen to Jack White with your kids.  Oh, really?  They can't.  He doesn't use dirty words.  Yeah.  You wouldn't have put his name on your arm if you used dirty words, right?  No, I wouldn't have.  Instead of listening to this, I've seen Turbo three times already.  See, look.  That's good.  This is a little fun, like, a kid would love this. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  This is good.  Mm-hmm.  Touch my hand and talk sweet talk.  I gotta knock it in my knees and I wobble to my fork and I'm trembling.  That's right.  Yeah, this is good.  I love it.  It's no Rebecca Black's Saturday.  You're right.  It's much better.  It's the new fucking song from Rebecca Black's Saturday.  Is that better, man?  I haven't heard it.  It's amazing.  Can we do that for the break, though?  Oh, please.  Because we're going to take our time with Rebecca Black. 
[01:27:00]  She's got the follow-up to Friday.  It's called Saturday.  We're going to get into it after the break.  Yeah.  We'll play this out a little bit and we'll take a break.  Stay there.  Oh, Bill Burr calling in in a few minutes as well.  All right, we got a couple music tweets really fast. 
[01:27:30]  You got Hans underscore booby.  Don't you guys get tired of pretending that there's no good music because the ones making  it are hipsters.  You sound old.  What are some of the hipsters, the hipster bands out there, Travis?  Alabama shakes.  But I said I like Alabama shakes.  I think he was more talking about Anthony screaming it at the hipsters in Alabama shows.  I just can't stand hipsters.  We get pork pie hats and you beat it.  Shut the fuck up.  Hipsters are assholes. 
[01:28:00]  You really are.  Oh, they're dummies.  You don't like the pork pie hats?  No, that stupid hat.  Fucking corn balls.  You look like a dick.  No one looks at that and says, wow, that's cool, except you're dumb hipster friends.  Everyone else thinks you look like an asshole.  An anus?  Yes.  I got to cancel an Amazon order.  Hold on a second.  Oh, shit.  Oops.  Those dumb fucking pork pie hats.  I despise them.  Stop it.  But as far as music goes, what other bands have hipsters in them, Travis, nowadays? 
[01:28:30]  There's a few.  You usually see them like on Letterman or fucking Conan.  Trav, you put your headphones back on.  What bands have hipsters these days?  Well, I think the biggest band that you could probably say have hipsters in them would be  Arcade Fire.  Which I like.  I like them a lot.  I like Arcade Fire, too.  I haven't checked out their new album, I'll be honest.  They're really pretentious.  I'm very behind.  I wasn't bashing the music at all.  I'm bashing when they come on and look like fucking hipster douches. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, Christ almighty.  What a collection of...  But they're not hip anymore.  If it becomes the thing, then you're not hip anymore, right?  No.  You certainly can't call yourself a hipster.  I think Arcade Fire is teetering dangerously close to where Radiohead was, where they're  going to start to be the cool band of hate.  Panic at Tissot.  Those fucking hats are awful.  Lumineers.  Mumford & Sons is a big hipster band.  Yeah.  Fucking.  But I like some of their stuff, too. 
[01:29:30]  You're allowed.  They're very popular.  I don't know what this guy's talking about.  Maybe Anthony just going after hipsters.  He's talking about Anthony going after hipsters.  Yeah, because he's probably a hipster.  He's probably an asshole with one of those hats.  Hey, I look good!  Shut up.  So your problem is less with the music and more with the hats?  Yes, the hats!  But you don't socialize with hipsters, so who cares?  No.  I don't care, because I don't socialize with hipsters.  Or do I?  I have no idea.  Maybe they're the true hipsters.  Right.  You guys are the hipsters, because you're rallying against the hipsters.  Look at this fucking shirt, man. 
[01:30:00]  I'm hipping it up.  That is a hipster shirt, I guess.  It's called a I Don't Give a Fuck shirt.  Right.  But that's very hipster of you.  And then, before we move on to Rebecca Black, I did not forget.  But every time we bring up Dream Theater, their fans come out of the fucking woodwork.  And this guy, BJ DeFreeze, with an S, on Twitter, Dream Theater, Enemy Inside, is an amazing song.  You've got to check it out.  Yeah.  We've done this break a million times, but can we do it again?  Yes, we have.  Could you give me Dream Theater's Enemy Inside, which is up for a Grammy? 
[01:30:30]  I hate Dream Theater, for the record.  I never liked them.  I had to play some of their shit when I was a music jock.  Here we go.  March 16, 2007.  What the hell is this?  This is the official video.  Oh, they're putting some veterans in the video.  Oh, okay.  That's going to make people...  Pump it up.  Yeah.  So that...  Hold on.  You only put veterans in your stuff if you don't have confidence in your material. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, man.  Because you can't shit on it if it's veterans.  Of course not.  Oh, can I skip the veteran?  No.  Oh.  No.  Let's make sure we don't make fun of the veterans.  Oh, no.  But I love the veterans.  But I see what they're doing by putting veterans in their music.  I don't like veterans, and I don't support them.  Oh, my God.  Yo, Jimmy.  Up.  A lot of good friends.  My duty was a 50-pound guy.  Pause.  We've got to get back to this in a minute, because Bill Burr's calling from Dublin. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  Oh, that makes sense now.  So when we get back, we're going to talk about Dream Theater and Rebecca Black.  Bill Burr.  Billy.  What's going on?  Hey, Bill.  What's your thoughts on Dream Theater?  You know, they're all very adept at their instruments, but I don't like any of their songs.  Yeah, I never liked Dream Theater.  But we got the Dream Theater fans, you know, yelling and screaming at us because we kind of took our, I don't know, our monthly shot at them. 
[01:32:00]  I never liked them.  It's a terrible, first of all, it's a terrible name.  Dream Theater, right.  It sounds like an organization raising money for some cars you don't care about.  I was just in England and Man United, their soccer team, their football club, the name of their stadium. 
[01:32:30]  They call it the Theater of Dreams.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, man.  I just figured I'd throw those douche chills at you this early Monday morning.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  How's Dublin?  Yeah.  How's Dublin?  Dublin is great.  I just landed here.  It was a sunny day.  Came in from 8th row.  There was no delays.  I was excited.  Jimmy Norton, I heard your name a lot all weekend in London.  Oh, really?  They were right on the show, and they're like, tell that little cunt to come over here. 
[01:33:00]  Oh.  I want to see his comedy.  All right, maybe I will.  Maybe I will.  You should.  You should.  I'm going to release my, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm releasing my special on my website shortly since Comedy Central just refuses to budge on their terms.  So I'm just going to do it on my website and hopefully get some international play there,  and then I'll see where I can go.  If you guys want me, you buy the special, I'll know you want me to go there.  Yeah, that'd be a great excuse for me to go.  Play a little hardball.  I like it.  No, but I mean, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:33:30]  It's like you don't know people want you, and if you can track where they're buying your stuff from,  you go, oh, okay, I do have fans there.  Right.  Bill, I was listening to...  I was just saying, I was there.  I was there, and they want you.  And they want you.  Thanks, brother.  I was listening to your podcast yesterday, and you were on one of those double-decker planes.  Oh, yeah.  I've never been on a double-decker plane.  It was that 8300 or whatever, the one that has two floors. 
[01:34:00]  Wow.  Have you guys ever been on the double-decker plane?  No, never.  They, for international flights, yeah.  I used all my miles up for the next 20 years to get on this thing.  Really?  Yeah, so me and my wife get on the thing, and, you know, we're both walking in there totally betraying the fact that it's our first time on a great plane like that.  We look like total tourists.  Like, oh, my God, look at this seat.  This is awesome.  Right?  So we're excited. 
[01:34:30]  Like, you know, it's a long-ass flight, so, you know, you're going to pony up the money, right?  All of a sudden, I just smell this fucking smell, and I was like, you've got to be kidding me, and it was this French dude, just every stereotype of a French dude.  Oh, no.  He knows.  I swear to God, he's putting his luggage in the overhead rack, and immediately, this paradise smelled like a New York City cab.  Oh, you fucking piece of shit.  Oh, that fig is fucking up your good time. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, it was horrific.  So, Nia had the window, and I had the aisle, and he had the aisle, so I'm right next to this guy.  And when he put his arms down, it was fine, but I swear to God, any time he would lean forward and reach for a magazine, I would smell it.  So now, of course, I have Tourette's, and I'm trying to get me to calm down until he finally smelled it.  But it wasn't that bad.  It was sort of the beginning of the flight when he was getting adjusted, and at the end of the flight, when he was getting all his stuff off. 
[01:35:30]  It was, to be fair to the French, I've met plenty of French people, and they don't smell like that.  But this guy was every stereotype.  Oh, God.  That sounds awful.  Wait, were you in business or first?  I don't know what they called it, because I used all the miles.  It was hilarious, because when I got my ticket, it said I was row 65A.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm like, we upgraded. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know, fuck am I in row 65, but 65, the 60s are the first rows upstairs, so.  Oh.  It was great, though.  Yeah, your seat went down into a bed.  But still, at the end of the day, you are sleeping in a Lazy Boy, which you'd never do in your home,  so it's never going to be as good as a bed.  It's way better than when I went to Australia from New York one time, you know, in, like, Coach.  Oh, man.  Sleeping upright.  Yeah, waking up every 20 minutes, playing a little Tetris, and then falling asleep again. 
[01:36:30]  My neck is fucking killing me.  Oh, that sounds horrendous.  What airline were you on?  For which flight?  Do you want to use this on this flight?  I think it was Delta.  Believe it or not, I was on Delta.  No, I think the...  Oh, okay.  All right.  And you said it was...  I always think if you're sitting upstairs on a double-decker, it's really special.  But on your podcast, you're like, eh, it's not really that much different than just being on a regular flight. 
[01:37:00]  You know what I think of this?  I think when you're in the old school ones, when you've got to walk up the spiral staircase...  Yeah, the old 747s, yeah.  Yeah, when I just picture people up there, there's a bar you can stand next to.  I mean, it's all in my imagination.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And how does it feel in the air?  Does it feel different at all, or...?  No.  Not really, right?  Does it feel differently?  I don't know if you've ever ridden on a double-decker commuter rail out to Long Island.  All right.  Same shit.  You're right.  You're right.  They are big, though, huh? 
[01:37:30]  I'm really killing a lot of dreams with these phone calls from abroad.  Just these shackles and shit.  Bud, you're encouraging everyone to go over and check out Europe.  No, no, you've got to do it.  Well, if you go over, don't go to tourist attractions.  Just don't do it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The same way you live in New York, you don't go to the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State.  Right.  Or Times Square.  That's what we try to tell the people.  They come to New York, and they just hang out in Times Square.  Stupid.  Yeah.  There's so much more shit to check out. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, exactly.  So I went to a Premier League soccer game yesterday.  It was fucking great.  Any hooligans?  I'm having a good time over here.  I guess they had a little problem with some soccer hooligans.  We were sitting in the night seats like a bunch of cozy, smug cunts, as they say.  And what was great was Arsenal scored a goal to go up 1-0, and they have a fight song about  how, I guess back in the day, they used to always go up 1-0, and then they'd play some 
[01:38:30]  suffocating defense, and you could never get them.  The entire reason why Americans don't watch soccer was basically their game plan.  So they had this huge song that they still sing whenever they go up 1-0.  So there was like two minutes left in the game, and they went up 1-0.  So the whole fucking stadium starts singing this song.  It gave me like chills, man.  They were going crazy.  It sounded like they won a war.  And as they're in the second horse, the other team scored.  Oh, no shit. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, man, it went deathly fucking quiet.  And in the corner are these maniacs for the other team, and they let off this smoke bomb  of like blue smoke, which you're not supposed to do, and I got to see the cops run over  a little bit.  It was great.  It was a great time.  Have you figured out that soccer thing yet?  I don't understand why America is the only country that's just not in.  The whole world loves soccer.  Yeah, but are you saying the rest of the world is boring? 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  And football is also boring.  Dumb.  I think we just have four sports we're already committed to, and then the hardcore people  can actually get into golf or maybe tennis, too.  I just don't think we have room for it.  And then also the way that they've marketed sports.  Once they basically hit that limit where anybody who liked sports was watching, so then they  had to get like Britney Spears to perform halftime.  But it's a combination of that, and then they also, all the rules are all about offense 
[01:40:00]  now and scoring.  So all of our games now, like hockey, the scoring through the roof, baseball, you know, all through  the Royce, you know, all the old records.  Plus, isn't it that it's hard for them to get commercials in, too, Bill?  The commercials, don't they play for like almost an hour straight or whatever?  It'll be hard to show commercials during a soccer game.  Yeah, that's what's great, dude.  You're in and out of there in like a fucking hour and 45 minutes.  But that makes it hard for TV.  But what they have on the sidelines, they have on the sidelines, they have like streaming 
[01:40:30]  advertising.  But then during halftime, like they say three things, and then they just show a bunch of  commercials or something.  But that's also why in the uniforms, why they have like United Arab Emirates, whatever the  whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  They put ads on the uniforms.  Yeah, which to me is like sacrilegious.  And I'm like, well, wait a minute.  We stop playing every two seconds for them to show ads.  Yeah.  If you go to England, like I wouldn't, you know, walk by Big Ben in Parliament, but definitely 
[01:41:00]  go to a Premier League game and then go to some shitty pub.  And then you'll get more of a feeling of what it's like to be over there instead of, I don't  know, fucking driving down to Stonehenge to go look at some rocks.  Go to Piccadilly Circus.  Well, anyway, the reason why I called in here, I didn't call the second annual Patrice  O'Neill Comedy Benefits for Family and Survivors of Stroke is going on sale today. 
[01:41:30]  And it goes, the ticket link is going to be live at 11 a.m.  Eastern Standard Time.  And we have a, we got a wonderful lineup.  Let me see if I can get to it on my damn phone so I don't forget anybody.  I got it here, Bill.  Oh, Jimmy has it.  Obviously, we have the wonderful Jim Norton.  Yay.  Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, Colin Quinn, Dane Cook, Talent, Rich and Bonnie, Keith Robinson,  Robert Kelly, Big Jay Orkerson, Harris Stanton, and myself. 
[01:42:00]  So, um, we're hoping for a great turnout like last year.  Opie and Anthony, you guys, we're hoping once again, you guys are going to kick it off.  Oh, it'll be great.  12 comics.  Holy shit.  February 18th here in New York.  Bill, is it City Center again?  Yeah, it's the City Center.  So the first show's at 12, I mean, 7, sorry.  7, and, um, you know, we'll see how that one goes.  If it goes as quick as it did last year, we'll actually try and maybe add another show.  That's why I got so many comics on this thing. 
[01:42:30]  We're hoping maybe to do two, and, uh, which I probably shouldn't have said,  because then people will wait for the second one.  Well, I'm, you know, it's just so many people last year, like, so many people love Patrice  on both ends going, dude, I couldn't even get tickets, or I wanted to be on the show,  and I, I didn't, uh, you know, like, last year I felt off, like, I forgot to ask Nick DiPaolo.  I threw it together really quick, and him and Patrice, I mean, we're really close,  and there's still a bunch of guys that I'm trying to get on, and, uh, 
[01:43:00]  whatever.  Well, I'm, I'm doing the best I can, all right?  Whatever.  It's gonna be, it's gonna be great.  Fuck is all.  I'm doing the best I can.  Tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. this morning.  Um, the link is a little, uh, we'll put the, the, the link on our, uh, Facebook page.  It doesn't go live till 11 a.m., so that link I gave you works, but it's not gonna come on  until 11 a.m.  Yeah, Bill, Bill tweeted it, and I retweeted Bill today.  All right, it's on our Twitter and Facebook.  It's, it's basically B-I-T dot L-Y slash Patrice Benefit. 
[01:43:30]  I know.  It's already, it's on our Facebook and our Twitter and all that stuff.  Okay, we got it on our shit, so that's good.  Or BillBurr.com, I'm sure, has the info.  Uh, it's gonna be a great show, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's gonna be a, it's gonna be an awesome time, uh, and it's also cool.  It's gonna also turn into a, uh, cool night to see all your friends, because I never get  to, uh, you know, like, like, Jim, I don't get to work with you other than when we did  the, uh, the, uh, anti-social tour, so I, I never get to see you do stand-up, um, so, 
[01:44:00]  you know, seeing all those guys, Nick DiPaolo, since I, I became a big, uh, phony, plastic  man living out there in Hollywood, I don't get to see all the great New York comics, so it's  kind of a selfish reason why I'm putting this together.  Yeah, it's funny, I don't, I don't get to see the guys either, do stand-up, I, I think  the last time you and I did a gig together, Bill, was last year.  Yeah.  Yeah, was the, was the other benefit.  The Patrice benefit, yeah, I think that was the last time we did something.  And, and where you at with your European tour?  You're in Dublin tonight. 
[01:44:30]  Yep, and then Helsinki.  I got past Helsinki, I break the back of this tour, it's all downhill from there, and then  I just blow through the last four, Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, and then  over to Iceland.  Holy crap.  Are you working in Reykjavik, Bill?  Yep.  That's where Fisher won the world title, in, uh, from Helsinki.  Bill's all over the place.  Just because you said that right now, you probably would draw at least 40 people there.  I'm telling you, it's not that, they're like, holy shit, he knows about us, he gives a fuck. 
[01:45:00]  I bet, I bet he's funny, and they'll go down and see you.  I don't understand how small their country's all.  They probably know half the people in their country, they're dying for a new place to  fucking handle.  Ah, shit.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, Anthony, there was a story over here you would have loved, um, to go off on when  I was in London.  I was actually talking about it on stage.  They gave one of their own, uh, troops.  He, basically, he was out on patrol, and they shot a Taliban guy, and, uh, the guy 
[01:45:30]  was wounded, and he went up to him, and he just shot him in the chest.  He said something about, yeah, you do the same thing to us, you cunt.  Holy shit.  The guy behind him, for some reason, had a, um, had a video camera.  Oh, my God.  He videotaped it.  So, now, the guy went up on murder charges, and he got life imprisonment.  He has to do at least 10 years.  Oh, my God. 
[01:46:00]  That is fucked.  Here's the thing.  Allegedly, on the other side, if they catch any Americans or British, they were, like,  skinning them alive.  Right.  And cutting their heads off.  Yeah, yeah, but, of course, you know, we can't, uh.  It's one of those awful fucking technology things.  It's because it was on film.  Right.  They have to prosecute the guy.  Right.  Because he's representing.  Yeah, but there's not, I would say, probably three days in the history of war that that 
[01:46:30]  has not happened.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I mean?  And it is.  It's, what's, who's the idiot that was fucking video?  Why'd he turn it in?  Why would he do that?  Jesus Christ.  They don't even.  I don't know.  Fucking know.  Could you imagine that?  You know, put that goddamn camera down, Red.  Barnes wouldn't, Barnes wouldn't allow fucking anyone videotape him shooting some VC.  Wow.  It's also, like, you're, you're putting these guys in these ridiculous, it's not normal. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What was that thing, like, in World War II, they would say, basically, that the human brain  can only handle, like, 200 days in combat, but it was okay, because you, the average survival  rate was 114 days.  Oh, wow.  Shit.  Right, right.  You're putting these guys in these ridiculous situations.  Yeah, I don't.  Personally, if I could somehow stop crying in a foxhole and I actually engaged, like, I  would.  Eventually, there's no, I'm already a psycho just trying to get through a fucking airport. 
[01:47:30]  There's no way, if you got me on the battlefield, once I killed one guy, I'm like, I, I mean,  if this heaven and hell shit is true.  Yeah, yeah, I'm already fucked, so let me go to town.  I, I don't, I don't understand.  Yeah, let me stay alive as long as I can, so I don't have to deal with Judgment Day.  How are they supposed to, why do they put, um, soldiers in combat to the same level of,  like, like, civilization as they do people that are, you know, just going to work every  day?  Is that the Geneva Convention? 
[01:48:00]  Is that why?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, fuck that shit.  I, I mean, if, if you're out there.  You can drop bombs from the air that land on civilian sizes all the time, but that's  not, my bad, I was aiming for the bad guys.  Yeah.  Right.  Wow, that is fucked.  Interesting.  Uh, I liked your, uh, your three.  Firebombed cities.  I, I don't know, I think it's because.  Delay.  There's no, like, uh, like the video.  It just was this jamming video, man. 
[01:48:30]  I, I, it was, it's brutal, man.  I hope he goes to that goodfellas jail, you know?  Yeah, where he could get some pasta.  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  I, I, I got a 3.30 a.m. text from you this morning.  I'll stop.  Well, I had to make sure you guys had the information as I was, uh, flying out.  That's all right.  I knew I was going to wake somebody up.  I'd fall asleep really quick.  It was, uh, not that big a deal. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, I figured I got called an asshole a couple of times.  Be thankful.  There's a couple people.  Oh, actually, I texted Dane.  He was still up, but he's on the West Coast, so.  He got back to me, so, um, I don't know.  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  All right.  All right, Bill.  I think that's all I got for you, fellas.  Have a safe, uh, trip.  We'll see what you get back, buddy.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Taking over Europe like Hitler.  I'm going to, I'm going to text you the name of the, uh, the promoter over here.  The guy's great, and he really wants to get you over there, so I'll text it to you.  You can send it to your guys, and, uh, you ought to do it, man. 
[01:49:30]  Just, just tie it in around a UFC event, so.  No matter what, you're going to have a good time.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it, Bill.  All right, guys.  I'll see you.  All right, Bill.  Bill Burr, everyone.  All right, Bill Burr.  In Dublin.  Yeah, Bill makes me want to do it.  No one has ever made me want to go over there except Bill.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So just give it a shot.  It'd be good.  I definitely think it would be good.  Don't have high expectations, because it's brand new, and just go over there and have  fun and see how it's all, see how it is.  Yeah, small.  See what it's all about.  Small venues, you know.  And bring your, uh, your friends Opie and Anthony. 
[01:50:00]  It'd make me, uh, give me a good excuse to go over there, because I've never been there.  I want to see it.  I actually really do think, and I mean sincerely, that we should do events, uh, there.  And Australia is such a long flight.  Like, how do we do it and make it financially feasible?  Well, we'll just go down the hall and talk to them.  But I mean, yeah, yeah, they won't fuck that up, the way they, uh, they did the other  thing.  I haven't seen Chris.  That's why I don't even care about this meeting to him.  I literally have lost all motivation.  Oh, I know.  Me too.  I want to be funny and be on the air.  You're right.  But I don't give a fuck about anything. 
[01:50:30]  Tim, uh, will, uh, help a lot.  I mean, but the corporate shit will always be the corporate shit, but he'll do all right.  That goes beyond corporate shit.  He can do a lot for the channel as far as structure and, like, helping the internal working.  Yeah, that'll be great, though.  That's fine.  It'll make it a little easier and a little, a little better.  But it won't affect my job at all.  But then I don't want to be in a meeting and talk about shit that will never come to fruition.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Like, like those type of events that we want to have planned.  I don't even want to talk about it.  It's all a lie.  Then we're going to talk about logistics and studio thing and staff and things like that.  Fine.  Fine.  Don't come to me then with any kind of appearance or, or fucking, we got to have ideas for this. 
[01:51:00]  You're finally, you're finally realizing that Scott Greenstein's one big fat liar.  I'm in.  I've been in.  Oh, please.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  He just lies.  Oh, he stinks.  He's perfect.  He's perfect for his position because you need to be like a lying guy.  We need a big event for you guys.  All right.  Here it is.  No.  Right.  Give us money.  Scott, I want the, I want our studio to be bigger to this point.  Okay.  I got it.  No problem. 
[01:51:30]  It's done.  Oh, wow.  It was that easy.  Yeah.  Another lie.  Another lie.  And then we don't have an agent that goes after this stuff.  I mean, we really don't have a guy who could just call or come here and go, look, this is what they want.  What are you doing?  So basically he says something and then we get the on-air talent going down and going, hey, come on.  That's not cool.  It's ridiculous.  I have an MIA bracelet with Bob's name on it that I wear.  People are like, why don't you fire Bob?  I agree.  We don't know.  But there's no one else.  I don't know of anyone else.  If you're an agent, fucking get a hold of me. 
[01:52:00]  I'll talk to you.  So I'm starting to think I might do my own deal in 10 months.  That's the problem.  The other agent works for the other guy.  Buckwald?  I think they're down to two radio agents.  I think when you sign with Buckwald, though, you don't get Buckwald unless you're Howard.  I don't want Buckwald.  Buckwald doesn't want us, trust me.  I think you just get his staff.  Right.  All right.  So the Patrice O'Neill, the second annual benefit for Patrice O'Neill, he was supporting 
[01:52:30]  a lot of people.  Very exciting.  So we've got to raise some money still.  And the link is on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Yes.  Tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. for the February 18th benefit.  There's 12 comics.  Most of them you know.  Apparently I'm the only guy demanding money for this, but hey.  Come on.  You've got to eat.  Hey, man.  You've got to take your taste.  Yeah, man.  We're all a little taste.  Did you hear Jimmy's taking money for the...  Fuck you all. 
[01:53:00]  Twitter.  I don't think even on Twitter they would believe that.  They probably would.  Everyone knows I'm giving.  Of course you are.  They're lovely.  Yes.  I told you they were bad guys.  They do charities.  That's a whole thing.  Oh, man.  I've got to tell you.  That Xbox One.  Yeah.  It is the shit.  It rules.  Oh, you got it.  Yes, I did.  How did you end up getting it?  Vinny.  My buddy Vinny was able to pick one up. 
[01:53:30]  He didn't give up with 20 minutes still left?  No, he didn't.  As a matter of fact, he was able to fucking come to the table.  It's not just gaming.  You know, gaming.  Right.  It's a whole fucking...  It's not a straight thing as well.  Yeah.  A whole multimedia extravaganza.  You just talk to your fucking Xbox.  Xbox.  Watch TBS.  And the TV just goes to fucking TBS.  Oh, wow.  I got to pick anything. 
[01:54:00]  It's fucking amazing.  Xbox.  Watch Sci-Fi.  Boom.  Goes to Sci-Fi.  Can you get Netflix?  Yes.  And then I go...  I go...  I go...  Yes.  I go...  Xbox.  Netflix.  Boom.  There it is.  Netflix.  Skype.  Hulu.  All your fucking apps.  You just get...  Voice.  Voice activated.  Everything.  And then when you do, like, Skype, it uses the Kinect cam.  And the Kinect cam follows you. 
[01:54:30]  It knows you.  When you walk into the room, it's like, hey, Anthony, how you doing?  It's like, hey.  And then it puts your fucking personalized home setup on the screen because it identifies  who you are when you walk in the room.  And then when somebody else walks in the room...  It goes, hey, I know you.  Sci-Fi 2.  They say, why is it Zig Highline?  You're like, that's a long story.  It's great.  And I was playing, of course, Call of Duty very shittily.  I was playing very shittily.  Very shittily. 
[01:55:00]  That's a pun.  I was just getting so...  I was getting killed at the...  I don't know.  I run around a lot.  And then I get killed.  And then if I stop, I get killed.  And if I come around a corner and someone's there and I see him, like, before he sees  me, I get killed.  I don't know.  I just shoot and I miss him.  And then he just shoots one shot and I'm dead.  And I also got Battlefield because I know a lot of people are telling me that that rules.  I haven't played it yet.  And I got Dead Rising, the zombie one.  That's pretty fun.  Those are all hipster games, man. 
[01:55:30]  Real creepy.  Total hipster games.  Total hipster games.  Absolutely.  They look great.  And, you know, the gameplay is pretty much the same as it was with the 360.  But I'm digging it.  Digging the Xbox One.  I have to get a PS4.  I'm going to get one of those, too.  And check it out because the PS4 people are giving me shit.  You got an Xbox, you fucking piece of shit.  I don't know what the war is about.  Like, what the...  Unless you're watching South Park, which is pretty funny. 
[01:56:00]  It's the same people who care about iPhones and Androids.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Coke and Pepsi.  It's Coke and Pepsi.  Yeah, exactly.  You got to get behind something.  I was a beta guy.  Betamax?  Betamax all the way.  Yeah, that kicked the ass out of the VHS.  Sure did.  Killed him.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Then we're going to get into the Rebecca Black song.  Love it, love it.  And our pal Jay Moore in a little bit of trouble, sort of.  Jay Moore's? 
[01:56:30]  What did he do?  He hosted, like, a NASCAR thing.  And I was blown away by his NASCAR facts.  He knew all the players.  That Jay Moore.  And then made jokes about everybody in the room.  What a brat she was about that.  I know.  She's a...  But was she on the show once?  She was actually really nice.  Was she nice?  She was great.  Yeah, she was great.  Oh, Danica, I got that.  Is she going to give you any of those twatty looks that she gave Jay Moore when she should  know that Jay Moore is just going for some jokes?  Look at her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend's hateable looking.  Yeah, we're going to get into the whole thing after the break, so stay there. 
[01:57:00]  Sure is.  Welcome back.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  What was the name of this band again? 
[01:57:30]  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Space Hog.  Space Hog.  Yeah.  In the meantime.  A f-song from the old days.  The only stage that really, really rocks.  Does it?  Are we?  Really?  What a facade.  When every other station is playing the same rock songs,  how could we be the only ones that really rock?  Well, I guess we were.  Yeah?  It was our attitude.  Man!  Look out! 
[01:58:00]  A couple things.  Bill Burr was talking about that soccer, right?  Uh-huh.  And the Arsenal?  Yes.  And they go up one zip, they always play a song at the stadium.  Yeah.  I wanted to know what that song was, and we found it.  Oh, okay.  Because Bill said it got them going, really got them going.  And what?  He said he got emotional almost.  Really?  Gets the hooligans going?  So I guess when they go up one zip, they've been playing this song forever.  No, it's not that they don't play the song.  The fans all sing it together.  They sing it.  But where do they get it from? 
[01:58:30]  They just sing it.  Oh, they just play it.  That's why it's so...  But where the tradition...  How did the tradition start?  That's what I'm getting at today.  It's probably ancient.  Yeah, there's got to be a little Wikipedia on what this is all about.  It started with the Druids.  That's why it's so emotional, though, because there is no cue.  It's just all of a sudden, all the fans are together as one.  That's awesome.  Let's hear it.  Oh, they're just saying... 
[01:59:00]  Oh, no, it's just another break in the wall.  One nil.  One nil.  They're just singing that they're up one zip.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  But how did it start?  One guy...  I don't know.  How does anything really get started? 
[01:59:30]  What was the jet guy?  Fireman Ed?  Fireman Ed.  Yeah, that's a good point.  How did that start?  Yeah, all that shit.  He entertained, like, what?  His row and then his section and then just grew from there.  And then he finally had to tap out.  Right.  Oh, I love Fireman Ed, though.  He tapped out.  He'll make some big comeback eventually, I'm sure.  There was a photo of him a couple weeks ago.  He was apparently at a game.  Oh!  He can't stay away.  Fireman had.  He can't stay away.  Oh, really? 
[02:00:00]  Just as a regular citizen.  Why did he tap out?  He never gave a really good reason.  He just stopped.  I think people were just giving him too much shit.  He sucked.  Yeah, he's like, you're ruining the game.  Shut up.  We get it.  It's not about you.  Oh, there he is.  But you know what?  Like, the Jets made it about him.  Like, they're the ones that put him up on the scoreboard and made him into the plane.  Fireman Ed, think about this.  Fireman Ed will come back, trust me.  Yeah, Fireman Ed's going to see Fireman Ed's getting a chanticle.  Don't you guys want to join a chant with Fireman Ed? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  No.  Don't.  I'm a naked guy.  No?  Huh?  I hated that fucking guy Yankee Stadium banging pots and pans.  Yeah?  Frankie says.  Oh, the fucking...  I stood right by him.  I wouldn't even acknowledge him.  I walked by him once.  Hitting those things.  You didn't grab his spoon and bang his pot?  I wanted to bend it and cup his chin with it and then fuck his face.  He was beloved.  He wasn't beloved. 
[02:01:00]  Bodysuit, man.  Enough with him.  What is that one where George was wearing the bodysuit?  Hey, bodysuit, man.  Hey, bodysuit, man.  All right, let's do some...  Hey, it's teeth and dry.  Hey, it's teeth and dry.  Yeah, that guy.  Poor, poor, poor Edgar.  Beat up in that fucking hotel room.  Hey, this guy's teeth are dry.  This guy's teeth are dry.  My teeth are dry. 
[02:01:30]  I'm dry.  How does that even mean?  That was great.  My mouth is dry.  He's dry.  I was putting all of his fuck...  He's all in his acting chops to try to make something out of a horse shit scene.  Did he really say my mouth is dry?  Yeah, that's what he said.  He heard the ghost say.  Just read it.  Just make like your mouth is dry.  Because the mob had him tied up and he wanted a drink.  He wanted a drink.  Because they were beating him senseless.  So stupid. 
[02:02:00]  He's so stupid.  His mouth is dry.  Like he would care at that point that he needs a drink.  He's fucking ready to get killed.  In hindsight, I would think that Lifetime would be well aware that that was a farce of a story.  It had to be.  It was very realistic, Sam.  Yeah.  Now we can't move on to Danica Patrick.  Because now a guy's saying that it's, you know, that Arsenal thing?  The 1-0 song?  Yeah.  It's no Blackhawks, Chelsea, Dagger after they score.  You got that one? 
[02:02:30]  What happens with the Blackhawks score?  Oh, no.  Did you find that really fast?  Yeah.  Chelsea, Dagger?  It's no Blackhawks, Chelsea, Dagger after they score.  What does that mean?  It's the goal song.  All right, let's hear it.  Oh, yeah.  It just sounds like a horn.  It sounds like a cruise ship leaving port.  Something we'll never hear. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  You know, the fans just sing this song.  And they go, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Fucking listeners.  Fantastic.  What do you mean?  Forget it.  They're not listeners.  No, the guy that said you've got to check out.  Oh, all right.  Well, maybe we should have a song after our first good joke of the day every day.  I believe in miracles.  I believe in miracles.  I don't know. 
[02:03:30]  Team's got their, you know, their stuff, their traditions.  Well, that was just kind of a sing-along thing, like they play music,  like the person with the organ or something.  Yeah, that's like being like.  It's not like that.  Like, I thought it was.  Oh, you should see the seventh inning stretch at Yankee Stadium.  They say YMCA.  Exactly my point.  It's like.  That's no point at all.  Yeah.  It's different.  I know.  So why did the listeners say that you should hear this?  Because I guess.  Comparing it to when the crowd sings a spontaneous, you know, made up. 
[02:04:00]  Well, the Islanders don't have that.  No.  Then again, they don't score that much.  Right.  That's true.  God, they stink.  Again, they stink.  I knew Matt Molson was stupid.  Even though his contract was up and blah, blah, blah.  No one cares.  It's that hockey shit.  Is that what's holding you guys back?  What?  That one trade?  I think so.  It all fell apart after that, right?  Oh, you guys are only in last place. 
[02:04:30]  Ouch.  Yeah.  That's not only.  That's the worst place to be in.  Oh.  Well, Jets Nation has a little hope today.  Because Gino had a good game.  Yeah.  It'll be a week after I said he stinks.  But you said you're still sticking with him being shit.  Yeah, I have to.  Good.  I have to.  Stick to your guns.  I'm not going to be tricked.  No.  You know, that's when they really.  See, look at the door.  Don't go home with hope.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to that, Jets Nation.  Any shitty player can have one good game, right?  Right. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  So let's not go home with hope.  We know what this is all about.  Plus, it was the Raiders.  Raiders stink this year.  All right.  Where were we?  Oh, Jay Moore?  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  So Jay Moore hosted the NASCAR awards or something?  A lot of growth.  What the hell is that?  What the fuck is it?  I have no idea what that is.  That's a new thing on the internet.  Yeah, you have windows open.  And commercials just start playing.  On normal sites, too.  None of that spammy shit.  Yeah.  You know what another fave that you do? 
[02:05:30]  You click on a link.  Let's say you're looking at Twitter.  You click on a link to look at something, a news story.  And then an ad will pop up in front of your story.  You close the ad down, and everything goes away.  And you have to re-click on the link again, and then the ad doesn't come back.  Or they do the thing now with pop-up ads that they do with YouTube videos,  where you can't click out of the pop-up ad that covers the screen.  No.  For, like, 15 seconds.  Nice. 
[02:06:00]  Crazy.  I like that.  Me, too.  I just want to read the story.  I just want to read the story.  More pocket money for the opester.  You love the clicks.  That's right.  You can't click out, motherfucker.  Keep on clicking.  I must have clicked on that stupid basketball video.  Oh, Jesus.  Like, eight times this weekend.  I'm in the wheelhouse of the whole thing.  I got tricked twice this weekend.  Yeah.  You know where they love that video?  On the Opie and Anthony sub-forum on Reddit.  Really?  They post that shit all the time.  Like, they go, oh, they announced who the midday show's going to be, actually. 
[02:06:30]  Here's the audio.  Click.  Click.  I've been tricked at least ten times.  Yeah.  And I made the dumb thing.  It's so funny.  That video has, like, I think 125,000 views.  It has no business having 125,000 views.  How many?  A thousand more than a time when it should.  I'm not stupid.  Maybe 20,000.  Maybe.  You think about 20,000 are there to watch a basketball trick shot?  Yep.  When I make a video, I hope for 20,000.  That's my number.  And there's 105,000 tricks.  Yeah.  105,000 more views. 
[02:07:00]  That shit.  That's not right.  From people being funny.  From people being had.  Before we move on to Jay Moore, we've got to go back to the Arsenal thing, because now  we've got people pissed off.  Look up Tottenham, and the Spurs go marching in.  Fuck Arsenal.  That's what I buy when I go to get a ham and something else.  Give me a Tottenham.  That's what I met for dinner.  Yeah.  I had a Tot Chaser.  Tottenham.  Do we even know what Tottenham is?  Is that Arsenal's arch enemy? 
[02:07:30]  I don't even know.  Yeah.  Here in Tottenham.  And what happens when they score?  Oh, they sing.  They sing, when the Spurs go marching in.  All right, let me hear a little of that.  Oh.  With their funny accents, it'll be fun.  Yeah.  And this is direct stadium audio.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, they're having fun. 
[02:08:00]  I wish I could get into soccer.  Just for the songs.  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man.  They're really into it.  Wow. 
[02:08:30]  It's like when the Saints go marching in.  Oh, that's special.  Wow.  That's a lot of people.  I bet all those soccer players feel very appreciated.  Yeah.  Look at all these people singing for me.  See, that's different than fucking...  Oh, let's...  Hey, dude!  You should play a video of the fucking...  Charge. 
[02:09:00]  Wait till you hear everybody.  They all yell, charge.  Yeah, it's cool.  Play that.  Well, the fans don't want to hear that shit.  Charge!  You don't like the charge?  No.  I fucking hate the noise in these stadiums.  Stop it.  When the screen tells you, make noise.  Noise.  Come on.  We don't need that, though.  Louder.  Yeah, all right.  I've been watching sports my whole life.  You don't do that in boxing.  Clap, man.  Hit the man.  If it's exciting, we'll cheer.  This topic has certainly run its course, but I really feel like bothering people today, 
[02:09:30]  so I want to continue.  That's a terrible reason to do something.  What?  I just like bothering people.  You're supposed to entertain people.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Hi, boys.  Hey.  I want to say one of the cooler sports things that's been in a while is the Blackhawks raising  the banner to that Fall Out Boy song, my song's No Way You Did in the Dark.  Really.  Come on.  Is it online?  What the...  Yeah, YouTube.  Just go YouTube, Blackhawks, Fall Out Boy, you'll find it. 
[02:10:00]  Fall Out Boy's not cool, though.  Nothing's cool.  All right.  Let's see.  But maybe it all came together for him nice that day.  Let's see.  That's what we're looking for.  That song is...  That song is...  That's pretty cool that they turn the ice into one big fucking screen how the fuck 
[02:10:30]  ain't doing that at national coliseum i'll tell you right now  there's an old tube television you can watch in the corner they're not even sure if their  jumbotron whatever the they call it over there is going to fall on the ice again but unless you  have nosebleed seats you're like i wonder what's going on on the ice right now that is true that's  bad dude i've never seen this before a lot of hockey rinks doing this yeah montreal does they're  like really yeah the entire ice is a screen i guess it's showing the stanley cup win obviously 
[02:11:00]  dude is it projection or is it under the fucking ice i'm actually skating on a big television yeah  you're skating right up though good point when did they start that travis uh geez a couple years ago  oh jesus you guys are you guys are 20 years behind get the islanders to brooklyn already just break your  stupid lease they're just a terrible organization they finally did the right thing and they and we  still gotta wait rejecters you know that the islanders have to play at nassau coliseum all next  year too oh even though they signed the deal a few months ago for brooklyn some why have projection 
[02:11:30]  on the ice you guys have capital one coffee and popcorn all right true but this by the way you  have loudsville right is that what it is oh yeah we have loudsville yeah this has nothing to do with  the uh the soccer thing that we saw no like this is nothing that was my point a video screen no this  is now we're we're expanding the bit that's what we do very well in stadiums yeah did you know they 
[02:12:00]  were doing this with the ice it is pretty badass that is very badass but now you might as well go um  all right did you see the video of them taking down the astrodome all right well all right let's go  back to soccer then fair enough let's go to eddie in jersey eddie eddie eddie what's going on guys  let's shoot this fucker here we go in liverpool when they come on every time they come on to the  home stadium everybody in the whole stadium all this line these they sing walk on now i'm not 
[02:12:30]  in jersey but it is pretty touching well that's the jerry lewis song yeah exactly from the mda  real good all right wait now we're going to listen to that thanks eddie see the bit continues  oh you'll never walk alone where jerry lewis would cry at the end of the telethon singing this 
[02:13:00]  as he's stuffed his back pocket with a lot of k all right  i don't hear the whole crowd yet no some of the crowd some of the crowd it's sort of lackluster who  who are these who are this who's this oh that's uh oh no but that's where jerry's voice would crack 
[02:13:30]  right jerry on behalf of the mcdonald's corporation and for your kids we'd like to oh i hated that  every two seconds they've had to say your kids like they were the only people saying it 
[02:14:00]  jerry on uh behalf of dupont's chemicals which caused the most of the problems  liverpoolians are a bunch of drunks  pretty cool yeah that's what we can't underestimate drunk men love to sing a song  oh they love a good chant a good song a good marching song by the way the spurs arsenal thing 
[02:14:30]  is really heating up now we got uh vb vb man oh nine fuck spurs they wish there could they could be  arsenal so there you go well look out here's the rivalry continues yes oh you found another one nice  this is just a general pre-game introduction yeah this is when they were playing the islanders  so this is nothing even special oh no this is i can't even defend them they knew they're going to 
[02:15:00]  win so you might as well just have fun at the beginning of the game too what why is nothing  happening i told them skip to like four minutes or so four minutes how long is this  fucking thing they have long intros we could have killed four minutes there oh it's always nice when  you skip on these computers it really starts right in oh look at that they should make them play with  the ice lit up and stuff yeah yeah showing weird images showing other orange images or showing another  hockey game yeah with a puck right in front of this one trying to swat the wrong puck very very 
[02:15:30]  confusing wait that'd be pucked up ah good one chip that was me oh well shitty joke jimmy  you have yes oh no what nothing i think he's a retired chip i'm i'm blown away by the ice  technology though it's amazing it's absolutely unbelievable a frozen water yeah how did i figure  that out outdoors in honolulu which is really impressive oh wow they really go to town here 
[02:16:00]  look at all the lights and that's a coliseum no well we we got a a smoke machine they actually wheel  out to the ice can you go to the islanders ice machine and then we'll wrap up the bit now you're  going to think that you're seeing something from 1980 okay but i swear to you i've been to an island  game uh within the last year and this is what they do uh-huh they wheel out some kind of smoke  thing near the entrance and the players get to run through some smoke thing this is how pathetic the 
[02:16:30]  organization has become and they can move on to brooklyn but oh come on wow dude that is definitely  looks like the 80s there's the difference okay video on the floor oh we don't have that  what a shitty but they have to they have to set it up they actually have to set it up they have to  that's awful they have to roll it onto the ice and if they lose that flag that's it they're done with 
[02:17:00]  the flag it's just the one that's all they got yeah how much visiting teams must hate playing in that  with a shitty locker room they probably have do we get smoke when we come out or no so that's  a subway down underneath it i got a ticket guy for the islanders he calls me every couple months and  and i have said to him on the phone go yourself i said not you personally but until this organization  starts doing things right i'm out i haven't been a seasoned ticket holder in two years now oh my god 
[02:17:30]  that's all they got that's badass horrendous smoke machine i i hear and they got girls that uh skid  around the ice with big flags that's kind of cool oh that's kind of nice right i'm watching the islanders  uh playoff intro for one of the games against the penguins yeah and all it is is about eight  spotlights like going around they're going around in circles like that's all they got this is when  they had to deck the whole thing out because they're in the oh my god it's just this spotlight that's  all they got it's infuriating it's probably people with flashlights up that's like coliseum should go 
[02:18:00]  okay we can't take care of you guys anymore you can leave even though we have a lease there follow  spots on the ice that's it yeah that's all this technology back in the 30s that's all it is  screen it's terrible like all the new stadiums have amazing hd screens they can't have a good  screen the one they had fell down it's only ice fell on the ice they really did yeah  it was in the off season right yeah how long ago i mean time's weird these days probably 
[02:18:30]  probably three four years ago at this point that's awesome this is the shittiest extravaganza  it's the worst it's not that long ago no last year that's it wow and they were like look we can  give you the spotlights or the smoke machine but we can't do both no i think for the playoffs they  they do they went all out and they uh rolled the smoke machine onto the ice as well they bring back 
[02:19:00]  nicolini they need to  yeah their in-house presentation stinks terrible we've got to have a dozen t-shirts for the t-shirt  gun this season yeah that's the most exciting thing is when they give out the t-shirt for the guns  that's it how long is this nothingness go on nothing happening  this doesn't have the excitement that some of those soccer games did no no that's sad 
[02:19:30]  rock this barn and this is when they were in the playoffs like this is as exciting as you can  walk this barn and like even their graph even their fonts stink it looks like an old school like light  bulb right were you at this game or no no i was not even when they were in the playoffs you refused  their tickets oh look they went with a little more spotlights oh they found a few more 
[02:20:00]  there's nothing going on there rock this barn is just blinking from their scoreboard  so what are they thinking when they see other teams like are they embarrassed  they should be they should be it's embarrassing yeah it truly is they're way behind now at this point  like this is like a farm league yeah you know this presentation certainly is exactly  you like this who's song jimmy i tapped out fucking eight minutes ago 
[02:20:30]  i hear you  make an announcement nobody let the who know that we're playing this song because we have no rights  but then yeah yeah they don't have any concept on timing no they just played an acdc song and now  they're playing this real long drawn-out who song which is cool if you're in your car how long are 
[02:21:00]  the fucking lights gonna go on for that's all they got that that's what i'm trying to tell you i want  you to be as as annoyed as the fans are rock this barn who took the video of this and kept going this  long and now they turn the light off lights off because that always has a good effect it looks like  night skate on uh the only getting rink the only thing they could add was turn off the lights and  keep the spotlights going  they just played the intro they don't play the song no that's it 
[02:21:30]  i'll tell you whose fault this is if this happens the fans for going  they're not really going you smart you don't go they're not really guys that don't go that's how  you handle this shit you don't go everybody's just sitting there waiting for them to yell yeah  now they're on the ice like a bunch of bees skating around that's it look that's how they got ready  for their big playoff game last year nice and while everyone else has this crazy ice technology where  they turn into a huge screen it's amazing i wonder how much that costs yeah it got to be 30 40 bucks 
[02:22:00]  oh okay yeah plus it costs a videotape  oh you want to the all black uh or blacks maybe haka is a dance they do before their games  huh what's the hawker i don't know what that is which team england versus jeremy's song they chant  uh a celtic boy leech the phone's with the lid people are actually into this a little bit  here you go the hawker there's a dance who does  uh-oh that's never a language you want to hear 
[02:22:30]  it's rugby all blacks you'll make it bigger i can't see it's a poster stamp  keep going on at the screen  oh that's music that's maori  yeah that's like wonderful warriors you gotta do that uh crazy rugby yeah 
[02:23:00]  it's like some samoan shit oh maybe it is one of those these guys look pretty badass  jesus they are problems these guys would fuck you up check where they're from sam  this is some wrestling move yeah no they're like talking to their like uh dead ancestors or something  that's like i think that's why they're so mad at him that's just intense communication 
[02:23:30]  holy shit that's how you wake them up and they're eternal sleep  we want to play against those guys they do this throat slitting move at the end you see that  that would be accepted here in the united states i like the hockey dance yeah we should start our  show with a hockey we really need one yeah let's change some things around new zealand  let's take that up in the meeting iraq can lead us in the harker dance oh sure he's here 
[02:24:00]  taking a day of leisure after his uh other day of leisure and party needs another day just to kind  of cool he needs a little buffer between the start and end of his party it's a long time before  there's another vacation so yeah it's not coming right up yeah well what what happened huh  just told me something in my ear what oh is it good that you're fired uh yeah  what is it good apparently eric's taking off next week what oh he's taking off next week yeah

[02:29:30]  poll at daytona in one move danica patrick silenced all of the haters and we at nascar and the fans  respect that round of applause for danica all right trying to get him back on the side look at this  look at the cop sucker boyfriend oh he's the fucking worst what the fuck is their problem  she's a snot yes and he's a fucking just a douchey she's slumping over looking at him like 
[02:30:00]  can you believe he just said that yeah like why would he roast me like he is everybody else  right which yeah that was an innocent enough joke if you're wow what a jerk off face i guess  she's having some bad years somebody uh put a smile on that face oh my god danica's here with  their boyfriend nascar sunoko rookie of the year ricky stenhouse jr you don't you don't really have  to plug for him danica that's funny danica's the star we know that danica wrecked ricky this year at  new hampshire that's a wacky relationship when you wreck your boyfriend in a race in new hampshire 
[02:30:30]  she wrecked ricky ricky let me uh give you a little advice just guy to guy next time your girlfriend  ask you does this fire suit make me look fat just say no brother  it's a good line it's a harmful they hate it they hate they hate what is going on right there  they hate him the the faces if you if you obviously this will be up on our uh facebook 
[02:31:00]  page you have to see how much they hate jay moore oh he's hosting a show he's doing a great job at  exactly what he's supposed to be doing he's roasting everyone yeah admire danica and ricky very mug on  i want to uh take a time out and give a very special thanks to the director  of the show for getting cutaway shots of people not laughing i'm looking at 2 000 people laughing 
[02:31:30]  their eyes at we just have danica going no that wasn't funny at all i admire danica and ricky for  making the relationship work ricky knows uh what we all know sometimes the guy just has to step aside  and let the woman lead just ask kevin harvick  um and uh i am so this is now i guess after and this is danica talking uh-huh about the jay moore  situation i suppose so she is a pipsqueak who's the fat one on the left she's fucking thick she is a 
[02:32:00]  thick blonde right but even even the thicks have a shape to them that is like straight down from armpits  to ankles yes they have like big thighs but not just like not just like a barrel body it is a barrel body  i of course have to thank the fans that's that's why i have this award i have amazing fans i'm so  fortunate and i think it's pretty safe to say jay moore is not one of them 
[02:32:30]  what  i'm actually trying to have a little formulation yeah yeah you can see on it  i don't mind the guy you know laughing at his own girlfriend stuff i get  that right but it was just a fucking cocky douchey look while jay is teasing her he wasn't being  brutal not at all but she was just definitely trying to have fun with it there you can tell  by the face she made yeah she's trying to kind of you know goes back to jay yeah all right and then 
[02:33:00]  jay does this i'm a comedian from new york and i've done a lot of friars club roasts and there's a  great saying with the friars club you only roast the ones you love so all the drivers that got  tagged tonight by the monologue you got to know what a huge nascar fan i am and i love all of you  specifically according to my twitter feed backstage i am getting destroyed because of the one danica  patrick joke and i want to set the record straight right now danica patrick what you have done for the 
[02:33:30]  sport of nascar and what you've done for women's athletics i could not be more of a danica patrick  fan why is she still looking like a cunt except for jay moore i was like no i need to address that  immediately we've reached the midway point in the show and if that's all right he was 
[02:34:00]  doing some damage control yeah she doesn't like being made fun of that but that's what  so many athletes are like that like not all of them with the face like oh really well because they  never got made fun of in school because they were all athletes so then i know i know no but the rest of  the room have to tell me they were okay they weren't great no the rest of the room he went did you see  the long clip when this whole monologue they're better yeah they were fine with it way better than  uh danica patrick's reaction so all right we're going to take a break uh we're going to talk about 
[02:34:30]  rebecca black when we get back a new song from rebecca black yep um oh some other  shit double my ring pull out of our ass oh the opian anthony show 
[02:35:00]  so  nice huh  let's see 
[02:35:30]  new zealand all blacks played in philly last month oh boy that's a bad combination you know that  hoka thing we just or the haka dance we just watched hoko or haka haka right uh during the  haka which we just played for everybody uh before the break uh during the haka the philly crowd of  course they did this started screaming go home in usa fucking funny you gotta check it out on youtube  you have it oh i thought you were getting that sorry it's uh negotiating a dentist visit 
[02:36:00]  yeah i i can't i i definitely can't do it with 11. three he told you when he can come  all right i think you fucking made your fucking point when you can fucking come  i was waiting for that  i wish i would have thought of it earlier while you were negotiating jesus christ  uh well i i was supposed to go in uh say i gotta get this bridge fucker and take care of 
[02:36:30]  there it is no what um but then she's like okay uh well uh could you come in tomorrow at 11 and i'm  like yeah and then i'm like no i can't i got a fucking meeting have fun so now  after that i don't know so what yeah that's not what's wrong that that one i don't think will  do us any service why none of them do not for the dumb chance no no the hawker we just did i guess 
[02:37:00]  they did some of that soccer in philly who cares and the blacks the new zealand blacks were down there  oh yeah and of course philly couldn't allow them to just do their traditional hockey dance without  they do throw batteries at their heads well they were screaming uh go home and usa  you know philly philly rules they don't play man and he'll actually have for the first time a  greenstone called the moody what the morning as it happens now the holy moly 
[02:37:30]  and you know they're called the all blacks because they're probably considered black  in new zealand oh the maoris are yeah yes because they were wearing all black no that's probably why  they make them all black they're making like weird faces  you don't think philly's appreciating this i don't know what they're doing 
[02:38:00]  they're probably just thinking some team shit so i don't blame the fans  are they saying usa  yeah yeah 
[02:38:30]  that's because they're just pissing them off for the other team  imagine them in the barrel liquored up your fucking mouth off  maoris are tough fucking guys man yeah who won the game  it's soccer i don't know well that one i would like to know just because i want to go fill it up  i don't know oh that game was rugby sorry yeah all right it's like i'm rugby you know they wouldn't

[02:43:30]  video that's all i think of  shouldn't she be showing like being sexy and everything i think that she heard her tits are  new so she doesn't know how to decorate them yet i'll tell you what you're doing with them you  fling them out there for everyone to see  what are they drinking out of the red party cups yeah it's weird it's gnat blood and come 
[02:44:00]  oh yeah oh that wasn't her oh it sounds like she's big  she's eating very well i think  this sounds like the music that zeta's behead you to  all right you don't want this saturday to end i thought she already woke up and it was not 
[02:44:30]  saturday anymore oh no no she was getting friday out of her head  today's saturday remember this uh-huh he's holding a sparkler with smoke with dorks is that her  boyfriend or something i don't know whoa what's going on why is this chick dancing kind of naked  talking with a not showing like miley cyrus right yeah yeah you saw that play yeah she looks like  cyrus from the warriors that's a terrible joke 
[02:45:00]  what a nerd party this is this party looks like yeah i wish it was at the happy land  i don't want to slide in the kitchen having fun great that's a white person party by the way no  shooting oh that's why your pants are missing yeah that's what they're calling your pants are missing  because uh he was doing the old time rock and roll bit for risky business that's right that was a 
[02:45:30]  blow-up doll doll wow she's jumping with those big tits i saw that good point good good point  oh you got all nice panties smiley cyrus like a look-a-like yeah  you've been looking for loads they're on the beach there's fog  oh nice arresting a black gentleman what is this what happened what is this  i like to have to do with the video that was racist it was a home invasion and they stopped them 
[02:46:00]  that was nice that's right good video oh i see dave days  oh where's that one uh dave days is another youtube star who is he he's the guy from the  video youtube stars are lousy they're terrible they are terrible wow a youtube star can get clicked  on because they're terrible people will watch them yeah wow so um she doesn't know what to do with  those big tits apparently i mean that's what i think she should be showing them but it must be 
[02:46:30]  awkward for a girl all of a sudden she used to be this little 13 year old and now she's this chick  with big tits and she doesn't know what to wear she woke up on your 16th birthday and had giant  cock wouldn't you fucking wear some tight pants it was in his mouth but it wasn't surprising because  he went to sleep like that he dozed off while sucking he woke up and his cheeks were still full  like a little squirrel he's fucking had a big cock in your mouth the guy just left his  frickin sam's mouth against his teeth and gums and some skull tobacco tobacco 
[02:47:00]  just a pinch hey people are asking if at the beginning of the song she said that's my dog  where's the peanut butter because that would be a bit edgy is that one of the lines no i think she said  where's the peanut butter i don't think she's asking for her so that's my dog where's the  peanut butter yeah i don't know if she's yeah she she said it you think she wants the dog to like  lick or snatch that's right she didn't get the beginning huh the very beginning you heard it too  play it that's it no the beginning 
[02:47:30]  this is my jam where's the peanut butter jam no it said dog yeah i'm like it's like an innocent  joke it said dog i would say where's my dog yeah i heard dog in there dog where's peanut butter making  reference to it i like to a peanut butter sandwich not a dog licking her genitals no it definitely said  believe it or not i don't know it was tuesday dog where do you think this ranks it's it's kind of 
[02:48:00]  catchy she set the bar high with friday but she looks like she's growing into a horrendous body  well she might be just going through some awkward hey wait when she did friday was it that  guy that same guy yeah the black guy was that what the goof was at the end was the black guy coming  in to like take his cut oh maybe maybe where he had to do his little rap thing yeah let me see  maybe maybe what's he saying let's see if he's saying something they might be yeah maybe she's  goofing on the black guy like i don't need you anymore yeah or maybe that was he's a is he producing 
[02:48:30]  this one too no no he's out of it no so maybe he tried to like get some money oh you see those  tints  you wanted to hear a little more of it didn't you sam yeah just to get the hook in again  yeah that's what it is that's his way go to friday that's it go to the friday song all right 
[02:49:00]  that's funny she's basically saying fuck you i don't need your rap anymore and the cops are  arresting him because because that's the rap from friday yes embarrassing we know this  oh what's that it's friday oh yeah yeah we got it friday friday she's short she's been to tgi  fridays i think from the look of a gut 
[02:49:30]  that's what he was saying and the cops drag him out and the cops drag him out oh rebecca black  doesn't want anything to do with this guy oh hannah and she took this shit from him too because he  likes to put all that stuff on his youtube channel and keep his entourage together but she obviously  because it disappeared on youtube for a bad blood there and then popped back up but on her chin i  don't remember friday what i don't i don't remember friday that's too bad for a second you don't remember

[02:55:30]  because there's a lot of stories to come out from that if you were following all of us on  twitter and instagram and everything it became a big social media event a lot of people that were  live tweeting erock's party dj who kid showed up it was a big is a big big deal but like i said we'll  talk about that tomorrow when erock's back right now pete davidson is in here hanging out what's up  buddy hey how's it going good how are you thank you for having me thank you for being here pete  davidson is a he's a comedian he's uh one of the guy code guys yes i was talking uh what's his name 
[02:56:00]  andrew schultz was in here oh he's a good dude yeah he was in here last week and we were just talking  about how mtv i guess because it doesn't play music anymore has figured out that they just need to get  comedians that they like yeah and just fill their network up with them yeah just like that's it guys  but it's all they what they don't understand is it's only like 10 of us but we're on everything yeah  yeah like andrew schultz came in here and he was like yeah uh i just got a deal i got four shows 
[02:56:30]  coming out i'm like aren't people just gonna get sick of you no 13 year old girls love it that's it  yeah so you're that's is that your big base i can get any 13 year old in the country good anyway  so what what's the cutoff when when girls start thinking that you're stupid oh well uh is it like  is it like really just 13 or can you squeeze in like till like 16 17 but like the girls my age they don't  what yeah they don't you're young yeah i'm 20 but like they don't care isn't that crazy yeah you're 
[02:57:00]  only 20 like you're supposed to be like the young up-and-comer yeah but but you've already passed the  demo i passed my demo yeah and it's i actually got trapped once uh at a show um this girl i saw this  girl in the audience and she was like really hot but then like i got closer to her and i was like oh  this girl's like 14 but no but it got worse what happened was her parents came over to me after and  they were like what do you think of my daughter why i was like yeah she's cute but she's like 12  yeah and they go no no she's 17 about to be 18 all i needed to hear was 17 so i was like all right 
[02:57:30]  get a number the parents said then it gets worse yeah the parents are like pimping out their daughter  yeah so we're texting nothing bad because i don't text anything bad because it could get  screenshotted and you got an mtv career to worry about like a dick yeah so what i did uh i texted a  couple times i woke up one morning with a bunch of tweets saying hey man just want to let you know  this 15 year old's telling everybody in school that you're talking to her so her parents lied 
[02:58:00]  oh and she's 15 it's that chick she was really 15 and so then she's going around her school and  now this cyber bullying that's invaded her school is in your personal space yeah and then i have to  tweet the whole story and like defend myself but all you did was text with her yeah i was like hey  you want to hang out she was like yeah but nothing further than that why would her parents do that  are they trying to get money like they're smart they think that they but mtv doesn't pay like  ridiculous money no mtv pays like a waiter at a really good restaurant right like an awesome  restaurant yeah yeah yeah but still not like what people think tv money yeah i can't take care of you 
[02:58:30]  what a bunch of scumbags yeah right so these parents are like oh this guy's on television yeah we  can pimp out our daughter to him we'll make it but what i would do you pay were they going to extort  you were they going to try to get you to have sex with this chick i don't know what they're trying to  do but all i know is i'm glad that i found out before we hung out yeah because all her 15 year  old friends were tweeting you and stuff and 15 year old girls were let like they like they could tweet  within 13 seconds of each other so they could get it out really really quick and they're just going 
[02:59:00]  and going so like one girl is sending you like 150 tweets yeah and then and then you have other people  that find out about it that are like commenting on other things that you don't even see like i  went on my instagram and it was a picture of me and my mom and then like one of the comments was like  huh you're talking to a 15 year old what a loser and then everybody else was like oh your mom's so  cute and like you don't see it right because there's so many comments but now it sucks so is that weird  for your uh comedy career that on one end because when you're in clubs i would assume that you're not 
[02:59:30]  targeting 15 year old girls so you want to be this real comedian but at the same time  you know right now your bread is getting buttered by these like teenagers that's why i've been having  trouble because when they come out they don't they don't like they think you're mean no because  they don't get it they don't know like you know they don't understand what i'm even talking about  like the only way to get them to laugh is to call one of their friends like miley cyrus  like oh are you hanging out with beaver and then they go insane they love that but good bits they  don't they don't have a shit about it so do you have to sit there and and make sure that you're aware 
[03:00:00]  of what's going on with them because once you're out of high school especially as fast as everything  moves now like they had this dude i was watching the macy's thanksgiving day parade and they had  this guy who i guess is the new dustin bieber but i didn't know who he was austin mahon yes  see i didn't even remember his name it's the worst but you gotta know who these guys are yeah you have  to because you have to be able to be in a club and be like yeah what's this is about as funny as austin  mahon yeah they go insane so cute it's the worst man so but what else are you gonna do right what 
[03:00:30]  are you gonna say no i don't want to be on mtv anymore yeah it's like better sweet yeah it's  like you know you get a little recognition but it's like the people you don't want exactly yeah i  have this great big audience none of them none of them i want none of them i could talk to i hope  they all hear this because i want you to know that people listen to this show all 15 year old girls  obviously so they're gonna think you're very cruel to them now uh but you're only 20 yeah 
[03:01:00]  now how long have you been doing stand-up for uh four years so you started doing stand-up when  you were 16 yep when was it when did you actually start getting successful like when did you start  getting tv gigs when did people start coming to your house i mean to your house when did people start  going to your shows when was it not just like a hobby um about a year ago i mean because only a year  ago yeah when i uh i'd say i got everything like a year ago so you weren't in high school going like i  gotta drop out of high school this comedy thing is going no i had to go to i didn't i did a year  of college and then it started to get it started i started getting booked like i didn't have any tv 
[03:01:30]  credits or anything so my mom made me stay in college and then is that what you said your mom's  rule yeah unless you have some tv credits i don't want any talk of this dropping out that's exactly what  she said and uh no i just i got the call for guy code and uh like when i was turn 19 exactly and then i  got wilded out and then yeah because you do nick cannon show too yeah that's how i met you the first  time because you were he was djing oh shit yes yes yes yes yes i remember i remember now is nick 
[03:02:00]  cannon show real like is that real improv yeah i mean most of it is yeah uh we practice it seems so  hard it's really hard because uh like we practice and everything but it's so different because if you  fuck up you really fuck up and if you bomb your first joke the audience hates you the rest of the  taping and that's it so like you really have to be on and that's that's why it's such a scary show  and that's why a lot of people don't like to do it and is nick like is he you gotta be on your  shit like is he on top of you or is he going like no well the thing is nick goes hard at 
[03:02:30]  everybody so like you have to be on top of your game otherwise he'll you know make fun right because  i was well is he sitting there going like you have to be good because i want the show to be  good or is he like i'm waiting for you to fuck up no he wants to destroy you he wants to make you  look like an idiot he wants to he has fun like everybody else that's how it started he was on the show  like a couple weeks ago and i said that's the different like people kind of want him and expect  him to be a douche right and he comes in and he's just he doesn't this guy in the world anybody  and he doesn't even do the celebrity thing no like he has that sort of comic mentality where 
[03:03:00]  he wants you to fail so he can make fun of you and he comes in and like i'm just throwing questions  at him he answers everything he's not like looking at a publicist and and bullshit like that he's  a real guy yeah it's a real everybody has that they're like oh i thought he's just gonna be  just this big dick like no he's the nicest guy in the world it's impressive now roland was telling  me that you know mike buchetti i know mike buchetti i used to drive him around island gigs when i was  17 when i first got my license and you were like where'd you meet him that you were driving him 
[03:03:30]  around mike buchetti you guys know him he's the guy who's he's been on the show a bunch of times he's  on arty's show he's the guy you hear breathing and saying thank you into the mic right right he's he  interrupts my steven singer live reads to tell me to tell you to do the exact opposite yeah it's  like go shoot go go get him today no i'll fucking get him today just just sit sit down and relax for  a little bit he's hysterical yeah he's insane i met him so you're 17 at the this club called the  loony bin in staten island and we did uh a show and then i had to drive him home and he doesn't know where 
[03:04:00]  he lives no this is a true story like we were he was like yeah i live on uh forest avenue and we  went to forest avenue and he goes pete this is so embarrassing i don't live here anymore and i was  like i was like where do you live mike he goes uh i live by a gas station and i was like there's a  lot of gas a gas station but it's in staten island so there's only 30 gas stations that we have to drive  by but no it was so how did you find his place we had to call his mom no and his mom was like michael 
[03:04:30]  how long have we been living he's like 48 i know that's what i'm saying he's an adult man  so he's like michael how long have we lived at this house and he goes oh i'm sorry i'm sorry  and you're going like what the fuck yeah and then i just went home after that and went to school the  next day i was so were you doing like late night gigs while you were in high school yeah and your  parents didn't mind my mom didn't care because i uh because she doesn't care about you i know i didn't  have friends in high school so instead of hanging out and going to parties i would just go to open mics 
[03:05:00]  or just hang out at a club i guess that's better how do how do the actual comics treat you oh like  shit yeah they still treat me like and i would imagine that most of the comics probably don't like  that you're this 20 year old kid who's now he's on tv and now he's got something going on well the  ones that i want to like me like me so that's all i care about but there's not a lot of people that  like so who likes you um big j okerson and soda yeah yeah yeah the people that i really like so  but everybody else is just like who the fuck is and mike bachetti oh mike bachetti loves me now 
[03:05:30]  have your parents met mike bachetti oh my mom yeah my mom because i have to tell you something  like if i was in high school and said i've decided i'm going to be a stand-up and i told  my parents they're like okay and i started going to these uh clubs they're intended for adults and  staying there late at night and then being like yeah i'm driving around this guy mike bachetti  once they met mike bachetti that would have been the end of my my mom was like comic days yeah yeah  she when she saw mike she was just like who's this guy i was like he's a comedian she was like

[03:08:30]  his own satellite radio company to bring us on board these guys must be great but yeah i mean uh  yeah so i don't know what's going on with them but uh but a lot's happening and we were talking  today on the ona show and this is what i was going to bring up with you because obi and anthony are  like they're older than we are i'm 30 you're 20 and they talk about like in gym they used to have to  wrestle what like wrestling was an activity that all kids would do in gym class i guess and they were 
[03:09:00]  like yeah when we were growing up i would never wrestle but i was like huh you had to wrestle no i think like  the most i think knockout the basketball game that you you know that game it's like well we played  not knockout and it's like you know you there's a big line two balls and you try to your first guy  shoots if he misses and the guy behind him makes it you're out uh-huh so it's the end kickball we  never and that's it yeah we're not allowed to like touch each other every now and then there was a  little dodgeball but nothing nothing nothing happened like that you could possibly get hurt yeah we never 
[03:09:30]  did anything like that i did try uh to join the wrestling team at one point because i was always  a big pro wrestling fan and so anything i could do that was closer to that i would do so i think in  eighth grade i joined the wrestling team and i was tiny tinier than i am now i was four foot nine i weighed  like probably not a hundred pounds that's what i was i was so small that they had to get uh like a singlet 
[03:10:00]  you know the the spandex that actual wrestlers wear that like high school collegiate wrestlers  wear they had to get a special one ordered for you because i didn't fit i was too small to fit into  any of the big ones so you were in your own weight class yeah i was in my totally my own weight class  undefeated and this is how my mom is so strange she was arguing like as the season started to end  she started arguing with the coaches that she wanted to purchase my singlet so she could have it  like so she could build a little sam museum like oh yeah you know i remember your mom loves you 
[03:10:30]  she's weird she is weird yes like she i last time i had my hair long like this was when i was in  college and i came home from college at one point and said i just want to cut it all off and she goes  okay and she took out like a trimmers and she just cut it all off kept it right yes i remember that  but i didn't know she was keeping it that's sick it was just weird and i don't know and then you  you know and she's trying to keep my little singlet but the coaches were like no we never  get singlets that are this small we need to keep it and she argued she never got it she never got 
[03:11:00]  it and she didn't lose very many arguments but but she lost that one but i did what they would do  for eighth grade wrestling was they would set everybody up with whoever was closest to their weight  so like even though technically i was smaller than everybody whoever was the smallest dude on the  other team i would wrestle him and i'm believe it or not not an athletic guy yeah i know you're  surprised but well you have the miscellaneous complex that i have like you don't know what race  nothing no no you get that all the time right of course what are you well i was talking about nick 
[03:11:30]  cannon he came in here he's like hey are you black like once and for all like i was like no i think nick  still thinks i'm black what are you i'm irish what yeah i was sure you were hispanic no that's what i  don't tell anyone i'll lose work yeah but yeah like you you play all the ethnic rooms no i did  because i did uh i did brooklyn 99 i had like the small i had a really small part but i didn't  realize it till it aired and i played a black guy i had no idea so how how did you find out you were  black on the show because like i i didn't i didn't like watch the whole read the whole script like i 
[03:12:00]  didn't know but like i was uh the whole scene was like it was this you know when cops try to scare  kids and they've that scared straight program well uh she started she was like i'm an at-risk kid  and she was like talking like a black person yeah and then i was like hey what why do black people  have this old and i didn't know that i was defending black people the entire time right but you thought  you were just like a very liberal white person like yeah this guy's got his shit together he really is 
[03:12:30]  fighting for black people nice guy no but they're like yeah you played with a black guy that's great  yeah yeah no i uh i mean i try to cash in whatever it is it ends up just being people asking me  questions but i swear when i was like davidson like when roland was like you are pete davidson  on the show it's like you're p and like i couldn't place your face with your name right because i assumed  you had some kind of hispanic last name i thought you're puerto rican i was sure of it yeah that's  awesome you like it yeah i have girls for girls it's way better who do you know girls like puerto 
[03:13:00]  americans and you know they don't like pasty no you know that doesn't really turn them on yeah  when they're like are you black i go no i don't yeah i'm like yeah what yes yeah i'm like jason  kit whatever yeah who's black your mom or your dad with your dead dad both of them yeah everyone is  uh but i'll go no and they go so what are you i get disappointed yeah i go man i go i'm just  i'm just a white guy like oh whatever oh oh i'm sorry like we don't have anything to 
[03:13:30]  talk about that yeah i'm like all right well i guess i'm just gonna keep growing my hair at that  well there goes that race joke that i was gonna tell you right yeah can you get away with doing  more racial humor because people assume you're not people have no idea they don't think you're white  you could pretty much say whatever you drop am bombs uh no i have a joke about it yeah but like i  don't you could i don't well i grew up all my friends are black right so like i grew up saying it  right and then like when i started doing stand-up i realized that not like other black people don't know 
[03:14:00]  that your black friends are okay with it so like you can't like i learned the hard way yeah but you  know yeah this is what that's what i was talking to i can't remember who i was talking about it but  um there's a thing where like little kids now 95 percent of white kids say they're all dropping  m-bombs but my theory is that at some point in their lives it's not that doesn't mean that as they age  they're just gonna keep saying it that's at some point in their lives they're gonna stop because  they'll meet another group that's like get the fuck out of here with that i think it's just 
[03:14:30]  because the way uh this my generation is kind of all growing up like everybody has interracial  friends right like it's not it's like they started that way like right five years old you had a you  know your friend was black right like it's different and i think that's why more people are comfortable  with saying it but it turns a lot of heads yeah when you're not around your age demographic but do you  think that as people as this generation gets older that they'll be able to start using that  they just drop m-bombs i don't i don't think like words are really gonna even matter eventually 
[03:15:00]  eventually i think it's starting to get it'll be better it'll be way better it's just more fun  people don't take words so seriously yeah so much more fun you don't have to worry about getting  punched in the face yeah or not getting booked and banned from countries because i told a joke  yeah like people getting fired dude everybody every comic is getting like nailed like you have to sit  there and wonder like what fucking path am i supposed to take here like you're right now kind  of at this point where like you're young and you're just starting to get tv work and you're 
[03:15:30]  doing stand-up you're like whoa should i start getting clean should i like i think i'm just gonna  start telling olive garden jokes until i'm like 25 just do the nice fridays and just yeah mom's  crazy i think i'm just gonna do that yeah for another five years you're in a good position milk it  because you could do that for five years then you're still only 25 and they're like oh well you know he's  growing he's getting there and then you could just when you're 30 just change everything just be  disgusting this disgruntled person yeah how uh how closely does mtv watch what you guys do they're 
[03:16:00]  actually not that bad because uh mtv2 is more for guys so they're the raunchier channel as raunchy as  they could be but uh no they don't really there's a couple tweets that they'll be like uh hey you should  remove that but other than that oh they will though if they see something they're like yeah  because i texted i tweeted ari shafir yeah he told me because i never did troops before and he gave me  this whole three hour why i should do it so i did it and i just tweeted him one night i was like hey 
[03:16:30]  did he do it to you did he do it on the air did you just no we were talking because ari's an animal  he's insane yeah he's one of the funniest people i know but like if you have to pay attention to what  you're saying ari's the wrong guy to be around because he is the most he might be the most like  just frank honest dude dude we would did i've ever talked to this girl like like said something  wrong she was being sweet but she said something like a little dumb yeah and he goes oh you're such 
[03:17:00]  a dumb bitch and i was just he's just like what yeah dumb bitch no she's a dumb bitch i'm like you're  insane no so i tweeted him after i did the shrooms i was just like hey man you were right shrooms are  real and then like within an hour they're like hey he was like no no no does that does that get  you shaky about everything else you're right or you're just like ah mtv oh no because i can still  do it in my stand-up like they said it's no you know that's because that's the only thing that 
[03:17:30]  i can't nobody can really say anything about but i guess i understand i probably should have  tweeted it to him i probably should have texted yeah maybe even a direct message but i was on  shrooms so i was like you were on shrooms while you were tweeting i was like you were right about  this somebody just posted this great article on reddit about going to a wwe show completely on  shrooms i can't do that i don't know why people would do that i was afraid to leave my room when  did you do it i didn't like maybe it was in the summer so it was like june and um it was yeah it was  it was awesome but it was this summer yeah it was this summer and it was just i wouldn't i wouldn't 
[03:18:00]  be able to leave you didn't leave your house my friends are like yeah let's go do shrooms and go to  the city and i was like this fucking cars every you can get hit by a cab because you're like in  la-la land uh-huh so i thought oh i thought the shrooms just made you more protective like you  just became everybody's mother like don't and make sure you wear a jacket when you go outside i did  them wrong because i i didn't know that you weren't supposed to like talk to your mom when you're on  no because she she she like texted me and was just like hey really proud of you just wanted to say 
[03:18:30]  and i just like just randomly like just sweet nice and i looked at my friend and i didn't want my  friend who's like a really hood big you know strong black dude like he's like really you know  he's been the type of guy that makes you feel like you can use that n-word whenever you want to yeah  he's actually one of those type of friends but i just did him with him because i was like you know  if anything goes down ryan will be able to you know take he'll protect me yeah and i looked at him and i  showed him the text and then we just cried about our mom like two hours yeah i started it was emotional  no no but he's like i never seen him cry because he's like you know he doesn't even laugh so no i 
[03:19:00]  just i just started crying he was like don't you cry man and he just started crying it was hilarious  the call for the morning mashup just walked in i don't know i think you have like a drug sonar  whenever like the topic of drugs is being talked about you're like oh there's a studio here that i  should be walking into who's in there who is that do you know pete davidson i don't all right  hi nicole hi nicole nice to meet you he's a very funny comic he's on guy code on mtv too do you get 
[03:19:30]  jealous that you don't have four shows oh yes all the time like like do you ever be like well schultz  is the king yeah fuck that guy he's the king no he has great hair yeah that's the thing i get it he's  really handsome he should be that guy plus he's like super positive like he came in here i was like  i was like you're young like what are you gonna do when this stuff stops working out and he goes you  know just keep doing great just get i'm like what the fuck are you talking about i go home and like  waiting for the bottom to drop out anytime anything good happens he's one of those  inspirational dudes are you that way no no i think i hate everything that's so funny things 
[03:20:00]  going maybe if you took shrooms you'd be more inspirational he's 20 years old oh my god and  he's already got this great career but i love that you're sitting here going like no this is not gonna  last this is bad every time i get something i'm just like this is whatever but that's not that's  the good attitude to have of course because it is gonna it's not gonna last it is gonna fall out  well i got really excited about something and then like they cut it out completely like the day  of and i was like none of this none of it matters anymore yeah i have no control over any of it yeah 
[03:20:30]  now it's a job yeah now it became a job wow it's just that quick yeah what was the what would they cut  out uh well i got i was supposed to get like this part in this movie and like what movie was it  movie yes oh that that's why it hurt so bad uh yeah it really hurt what movie was it um it's  neighbors it's it's with seth rogan and like this other okay oh was it um it didn't come out yet  okay it's the one that zach efron was caught doing like blow and not showing up to oh that's why i 
[03:21:00]  was also more upset yeah i was like i could have been there to blow with zach efron i love high school  musical yeah dude i was 13 when that shit came out i get it cats in there okay i mean i don't know the  songs um but uh i do it was probably 23 when it came out so i probably shouldn't even know that  there's three of them but uh no there is three but go on no um but like it was uh i auditioned for it  in like i don't know like probably like march and then it got to like july and they were like it was 
[03:21:30]  between me and this other guy and then they were like hey what do you think i think we got it and then  they were like they were like looking at flights ballet and then like the day of shooting they're  like yeah oh it's not happening no good and that's when you realize what the industry is i was like  fuck all this yeah you're like was that the first big rejection yeah no it wasn't like it was just  i was so excited i got to skype with like with seth rogan yeah he was talking to me like hey i think 
[03:22:00]  you're hilarious and i was like oh this is it yeah this is how it happens this is how it goes  you know i called my mom people wait a lifetime for a moment yeah yeah you went there i did that's  how i felt like it was this inspiration it was big i would rather have not gotten it right away  the fact that it took like six months and then like it just you know and then it shifted right into  you had a bad day there was the american idol goodbye song i watch a lot of american idol 
[03:22:30]  i love his life yeah i watch it i watch x factor too but that's going to continue to happen over and  over so it's good that you have that you know that's why stupid andrew schultz is so positive  because he's like this handsome dude with a hot girlfriend he gets and he gets everything he's got  every like trust me i'm in the same bandwagon as you i started but when i was 20 you're lucky when i was  20 i was still like oh everything's great i'm gonna be awesome i'm just a phenomenon and then 
[03:23:00]  you get here and you realize oh there's another rejection just pile them up it's all terrible  everybody hates me i don't even know why how i got here but so was that the first big rejection  yeah it was pretty much a big it was yeah it was let down you know what i think you're very lucky  that happened because otherwise you're sitting going like yeah i'm on andy sandberg's show i got nick  cannon i'm about i think if i would have got it i would have bought a chain so i'm really  sad i didn't get it i would have got something stupid yeah you know how i know because i know  i'm like i know i would do dumb things because uh i don't for no reason it was probably an accident 
[03:23:30]  but like young money followed me on twitter yesterday and my god did i have a fit yeah like  an hour i was like maybe if i could i could do it and enough people think i'm either puerto rican or  black that i could have a certain amount of street cred nobody would be surprised if i dropped a  mixtape plus and you could start dropping m-bombs wherever like no you don't understand i'm a  rapper well like no there's this rapper french montana that gets away with it all the time  dude i don't think he's really black you don't think so he's far from it yeah he's there's no 
[03:24:00]  way he says he's like african or something but he does well doesn't he wear like sphinx necklaces  everywhere and stuff yeah i think that's all he gets away with it because they're like he's ridiculous  when you saw that he was following you did you tweet him were you like no no it was like the young  money group yeah it was like their official twitter yeah which is big because that means  somebody not maybe one of the managers right and they dm'd me and they were like hey yo let's  really and let's get it and i was like yes let's get it let's do that i was like i want to do a song

[03:26:00]  let's get it i have no idea i'm pretty sure it was just like anybody they follow that's the automatic  message oh i have no idea but you responded in the affirmative yeah i responded like yeah let's  link up smiley face and that's it yeah and they'll probably never reach out again you tweet him again  later like hey i don't know if you messaged me back my phone number if you want to text me  you do one of those things like hey my phone's been acting weird so maybe you didn't yeah hey been  off twitter for a week so uh so i miss it yeah i don't know but uh but you gotta get you gotta get 
[03:26:30]  rejections yeah because otherwise you think it's all magic and like the further in you get because  at some point the well's gonna run dry and like i always see people your age getting successful and  i know and it makes this is the only thing that makes me feel better i know it's not gonna last  oh no i know that i know this isn't gonna last like when i was like 25 i'd be really jealous about  somebody like you coming in at 20 with all this stuff going on but now that i'm 30 i'm like oh i can't  wait to see it crumble i can't wait no that's true that's true like when my friends get like 
[03:27:00]  when one of my one of my friends was like six months at this at the standup and he got something  yeah and he was like yeah this is it this is my time and he thinks he's better than you yeah and  then nothing has happened exactly and it's glorious isn't it it knows who you are now so maybe you  get a call from him you sound like my wife you want to be positive i don't think you know i think  you know you skyped you had a thing we did skype you did sky mother knows about it so yeah you 
[03:27:30]  still live at your mom's house no i just moved out nice yes nice so you're doing the thing but i  think it was bad i think i should have stayed why i don't think i'm ready to live on my own  yet oh jesus now is it though is it because laundry the chores your mom's doing your own  lawn it's just like you don't realize it like do you know what i did for i think the first four  years of living uh alone or with my girlfriend or my then girlfriend now wife we go to dinner at  my parents house like probably once a week because we still lived in westchester it's like 20 minutes 
[03:28:00]  away but i would put my laundry in a bag and i would bring i would bring my laundry be ashamed  of yourself like it got it got to the week it got to the point where jess was like you just  you can't do it anymore because you don't understand when you move out of your mom's house  like when you live with your mom all you have is weed money yeah and then you move out and you're  like i gotta buy detergent food and you know yeah that's why i don't i i would say stay at your mom's  house yeah like why they have the extra bills yeah more money for weed and mushrooms yeah that's why you 
[03:28:30]  came in he was talking about his first why you don't like those are you kidding me you got that way  wrong pete you got that you couldn't be more off i mean i'm not at the second because there's a baby  in my belly but she's pregnant she's not fat pre and definitely post i mean yeah yeah you're already  planning your drug yeah i i cut it off like shroom you could do like i probably three times a year  yeah is that accurate nicole i had i did like a handful maybe no i did maybe like 10 times in one  year and then i was done i did them all right it was once a month twice a month i did them twice 
[03:29:00]  and i did it back to back days and it's you did it two days in a row because i was like hey i'm  doing this now you know i'm trippy yeah can people do that like the way some people really  into juicy j at the time and uh i just did it yeah that seems really bad for you for shrooms to be  like no i mean i do shrooms like every day but that's not like a thing you could do no see i never  i don't do any drugs i never have never smoked weed or nothing oh that's great i wish that's 
[03:29:30]  no people that's what i'm saying that's why i like nicole in my life because people always say  that's if it was that great you wouldn't be worried about your weed money right if it was great to not  smoke weed you wouldn't do it i'm a person who's fearful of change and has other issues that need  to be dealt with oh man it's not like i'm like healthy living okay i just got my friend i eat mcdonald's  three times a week it's not i eat mcdonald's all the time right i don't care i'll get pimples  i like the food i mean it feels so good yeah but then then you're not gonna be 20 anymore you're 
[03:30:00]  gonna end up looking like mike bachetti and then and instagramming stuff about not eating bread and  soda anymore and then i finally get to do fat jokes right right you just keep changing you know it  it's evolving you know it i'll be uh no my friend just who just moved in with me he uh he's like 30  and he's never smoked weed in his life because he's like it's jesus no and his mom yeah that's the other  thing i don't have religion either i've none of the like all the good stuff that's associated with  not doing drugs or drinking i don't have any of the good stuff it's just it's just i feel like not 
[03:30:30]  drinking or doing drugs is the good thing you don't drink even nothing jesus  now i'm a little pissed off  yeah uh i feel so weird there's something  no because there's something when you hang out with someone there's just certain conversations that  you indulge in you know what that is that's prejudice it's okay that's like i acted around  you as the same race yeah whatever that is but that i acted that's like me being like oh irish 
[03:31:00]  the fuck out of here i thought you were like i was trying to get some puerto rican comedians in  tonight no oddly sam's one of my favorite people to be with when i messed up see he keeps you no he's  fun oh you're just fun you're just you're natural i'm a fun guy you'd probably be  fucking crazy you'd be a psycho or just like really angry yeah because i'm not angry like  really just mean to people yeah yeah he makes me laugh he's a he's a good person he can hang no 
[03:31:30]  matter what it doesn't matter that's cool yeah i don't i don't i don't dislike the habits no you  know he takes advantage i mean nicole for a while had kind of a problem and i told her you got to  knock it off for a little bit but there was no problem like to party i do like  a lot so are you planning your partying for after pregnancy like do you have a post-pregnancy  party plan it might call my coming out party did you hear all of that alliteration i said  post-pregnancy party plan i like that yeah i gotta do it you're gonna have a coming out party i don't  think mushrooms will eat well i mean unless you want to come i don't think you could trip out 
[03:32:00]  with a baby in your house right because like if it how long does it last it lasts about four four to  six hours jesus christ or and if you drink orange juice yeah it's orange juice but if  orange juice makes it worse i didn't see but if you drink milk it goes away and i didn't know so  like if you take an emergency you're but see this is like i get so scared like i like to have control  over things and situations you know i like to know what's going on i like to know what routes i can take 
[03:32:30]  i like to know where i can go i like to know what's going on in my brain at all times i don't i feel  like i would get into a severe panic attack if i like i was like tripping out on mushrooms i had  no idea and an hour in i was like it could be five more hours of this i would immediately go into  a massive heart attack and stroke did you ever look in the mirror do you ever have one of those i  turned green yeah i was an old woman what no me and me and my friend like we were in the bathroom  like looking at each other yeah like and he was like yo yo turning green and then i looked at 
[03:33:00]  him i was like you are turning green you agreed with him no yeah we freaked out so i ran downstairs  in my building and i went to like the first floor and the doorman was like hey is everything  okay because i'm sweating and i was just like yeah i'm just really high you told him yeah yeah  hold my doorman which is bad because i'm in a building where like i'm the youngest person by  like 25 years and is this your new building where you live by yourself yeah great yeah so they 
[03:33:30]  they were uh they already think of a drug dealer right they don't believe that i just lived there  or whatever and i don't help by making the hallway smell like weed all the time right coming down  freaked out like that yeah so i came up freaked out i was just like oh he's like are you okay i was  like yeah i'm just really high and then you see ryan my friend on the elevator look at himself in the  thing and he's like you also don't really can't do that see that's that's why i feel like but it's  fun i would get along because you guys would be like yeah you really are green and i'd be like 
[03:34:00]  you know what you're both green it's just because the bad even the bad shit's fun you get the you're  just like yeah that was crazy right it's memories it's life experiences yeah you guys life experiences  you gotta be the people you feel safe with you know what yeah i don't trust people that's the other  thing i don't trust anybody yeah i know so even your wife my wife yeah but that would be weird  doing shows with your wife yeah i don't think i want to it's not like an experience i would want  because you gotta you're still gotta be you i like to be responsible for my actions yeah we 
[03:34:30]  know you know and when you're with your wife you kind of got to be responsible for your actions  don't you yes and so it's like no i was on shrooms you don't understand she's like yeah i don't  like that shit right like it's not that fun do you know how much fun it is to like smoke a joint  i have no idea watch the grinch i don't like i thought i made that clear i have no clue  movies are awesome way more awesome so great you're talking about the jim carrey grinch or the  cartoon no the jim carrey grinch that was scary when you're i watched it like a like a week ago  and i'm like this shit's pretty good how often do you get stoned um every day well i have crones 
[03:35:00]  so like i actually have to smoke what's crones it's a stomach autoimmune disease so what do you  what happens to you if i don't smoke i can't eat all day because i'm in pain what yes i have to smoke  i mean i do it because i like it obviously but i do like to do it a little more because of it  right it's like if it's like if medicine tasted like cotton candy yeah you'd be like yeah i have to take  this medicine but cotton candy is still delicious absolutely so what happens if you if you don't  smoke meat does that mean you throw up everything or the other one well i have in my case i would 
[03:35:30]  throw up because that's how my things water but how long have you you've had it forever i've had it  for like three years two years how do you catch crohn's disease it's just in the family well if you  only had it for three years it's not like a cold sam no it's yeah but if you only had it for three years  it's not like you had it when he was born just certain things click in some people you know  get diseases god that whore gave me gross no he wraps it up he told me he wraps it up every time  he's good he's smart like that i have irish wiener so like there's always red and i'm always worried 
[03:36:00]  oh we're small no it's not it's because that's what irish steak that's the myth isn't it no it's not  no it is i'm married to an irish wiener and it's perfect yeah no well isn't that isn't that  romantic irritation no skin irritation not there well i'm allergic to condoms oh no you are you're  allergic to condoms yeah but i use them anyway good boy do you have to get like do you ever try  like sheepskin or whatever else yeah but it just smells bad it does yeah bad it smells like we  already had sex you got that okay all right i just didn't want that to get passed over come on 
[03:36:30]  sober jokes they're also not you know the sound of sheep makes  they also don't think they're as effective what there's the sheep's no they're not  they have very porous skin it's just gross yeah you just feel so you're allergic to condoms and  you have crohn's disease yeah i'm a product of the new generation i also hate happiness right  i have adb i was about to say yeah you probably have add yeah because everybody has ad i'm surprised 
[03:37:00]  you're not autistic honestly at least everybody's autistic now i hear about susan boyle of course  yeah wow breaking news susan boyle's autistic but to find out at 50 something is like i found out  five years ago when i saw her on tv the first time what do you mean she found out at 50 something  yeah she remember when she like cried because simon was like me like i was like yeah i was like oh look  at that chick with asperger's crying about simon she wanted to like get with simon yeah like she 
[03:37:30]  thought she had a shot that's autistic that's like news to you it is you think she has a shot  she was officially diagnosed it's not like i knew something was wrong well she's been she has been  going to some shit doctors mike bachetti should hit her up that would be the perfect couple yeah  that really would mike bachetti and uh did you meet mike bachetti when he was in here no i don't think  i did no you will next time i feel left out you will next time he's so much fun he is he's a blast  fun does he get high no he doesn't right no with all these people i don't think he can't he's sober 
[03:38:00]  he's sober okay that's different he's sober um but he's fucking hilarious i feel like i should  start drinking just to stop after because then people just leave me alone about it if i'm like  no no you've never had one drink no no like never even just one like you asked me that five  seconds ago and i said no you can rephrase the question as many times as you want i'm just surprised  why do you get mad that people are surprised yeah i'm not mad but it's the same question  four times in a row because you get asked that all the time everybody gets pissed at you yeah i'm 
[03:38:30]  like they're really yeah so you're gonna have it you're like no i don't drink yeah and no i don't  do that yeah yeah i make life choices yes you do okay all right power moves power moves you're a  powerful man he actually knows what he's tweeting at two in the morning i do mtv has never called me  and been like you gotta take that shit about mushrooms off your twitter yeah like what are you  fucking crazy yeah oh man you get any replies on the mushrooms tweet when you posted it out yeah  i got a bunch of everybody was happy they were i knew you were cool finally yeah but you know i get 
[03:39:00]  it i get why i can't do it yeah yeah you know your audience you're not happy about it no it's just so  uncomfortable it's so weird because he was saying before you came in that it's all like a little  teenage girl like he's 20 years old he's out of mtv's demo yeah that's true like i'm sitting there  anytime anybody tells me the guy code is not funny they're always my age and i'm like they're not  putting on a fucking tv for you what are you doing watching mtv you pervert like you're 30 years old  right actually i still laugh at guy and girl code i think they're both they're they're kind of yeah 
[03:39:30]  they're comedians on the night all the comedians are good stand-up yep so i've jesse maple luso i love  her chris de stefano yeah carly carly yeah carly so funny her delivery is really funny to me she's  really funny and i mean now p davidson hello you be the judge i like that you kind of hate it though  no i don't i feel uncomfortable with it yeah you know like i'm grateful obviously to be on it and  everything but i don't like it and you like you more like the idea of having a long career yeah 
[03:40:00]  paying your dues and no i just want like a stand-up career right you know i don't want one of those  andrew schultz tv careers no i mean he's doing great man i'm kidding no you really like andrew  i love andrew he's crazy i'm gonna have him back on he's so perfect for those shows though he is  he's just like you don't like bitches what do you wear crocs and you're like he's the guy that should  be saying that yeah like he's the perfect face for it so do you sit there like are you sure that  you're like yeah this is where i'm supposed to be or are you sitting there on that show going oh 
[03:40:30]  fuck i'm they're gonna find out that i'm not right for this at any moment well it's just i don't  know a lot of shit like they were half the topics are like hangovers and i'm like i obviously can't  talk about they can't use me for that how come because i'm not 21 so oh shit even though you  blatantly even though they blatantly know oh i forgot yeah you do all these illegal drugs you're not  technically allowed to train to do them yeah so yeah they didn't you know the weed topic they cut me out  everything that has to do with fun they basically fucking cut me out weed there's no legal age like it's all 
[03:41:00]  illegal yeah but like i i don't know so you must you must be a strong advocate for medical marijuana  i think it's great you need it and i think it's great that they because i weed i really don't think  should be legal it's probably safer than alcohol quite honestly i know it is but i think it's more  fun that it's not legal right once everybody can get it in new york like how am i gonna get girls  so right you know like i'm not i'm really i really hope that it's not like if you could get 
[03:41:30]  it at cvs it's not like yo i got some weed yeah all right so it's so bad i got combos  but no because and the good cool thing about la though that's the that's like why it's really cool  to go there and they give you it in containers and they make you feel like you got one of those cards  yeah no oh my friend does yeah just get but but you actually have a reason that you have a reason to  have a card yeah like i actually have a real medical you get headaches uh being in new york you  can't have a card you can't yeah it doesn't jersey though okay so that shit does hold your stomach 
[03:42:00]  down like you don't you eat everything's fine yeah you eat mcdonald's like people are supposed  to throw up after that no regardless of any crones i'm like supposed to eat like grilled chicken for  the rest of my life like i'm not supposed to eat anything but you're like i can get high and then  eat whatever i want everything but that sounds like two good things like that's like that sounds  terrific it's just a stomach settler even i don't have any disease and pot always sells my stomach  it does yeah you just feel great it settles your belly i had no idea well now you know you ever 
[03:42:30]  try pepto-bismol it just doesn't work it's not as good you don't like tums yeah yeah i don't know  i mean there's it's an antacid i don't know if you don't put the thing in your drink i don't know what  weed does yeah i don't know what weed does for heartburn i don't know i'm sure it helps i'm sure it helps  everything it helps everything look i can't advocate for this dude i have a relationship  with my grandparents now because of weed how is that because one of them they're annoying oh okay  and so you'll get high yeah because i mean they're it's not that they're annoying it's just they i don't 
[03:43:00]  see them a lot you know because like i'm busy or whatever but like they so when i see them they talk  about everything now let me ask you if you hadn't been given all these opportunities to be on tv  you get stoned every day yeah you think you'd just be at home all the time doing nothing i would  be on suicide watch yeah i wouldn't know what to do you suckered mtv into giving you this gig so it  seems like since you're filming tv shows you're actually doing productive things yeah now if it  wasn't for mtv too it'd just be like yeah i get high all the time and tell the exact same jokes every
