<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about "mancations,"  with Opie and Anthony expressing skepticism, viewing them as potential covers for infidelity.  They explored various justifications men offer for these trips, ranging from escaping family pressures and reliving youth to pursuing activities women wouldn't enjoy (like hunting or golfing) and explicitly seeking sexual encounters.  Anecdotes about paid sex in Brazil were shared, alongside discussions about the sexual possibilities inherent in different types of mancations. A caller, George, defended mancations, mentioning strip clubs and the need for "decompression" from family life.  The hosts also discussed the increasing popularity of mancations and the marketing behind them.

Next, a difficult phone conversation with Jane, a friend of the frequently mocked deaf news reporter Karen Meyer, occurred via relay service.  The conversation, punctuated by misunderstandings and interruptions, involved Jane's defense of Karen and resulted in a humorous, but uncomfortable exchange filled with insults and sexually suggestive comments from the hosts.  Following this, the Iron Sheik appeared as a studio guest, discussing his wrestling career, experiences in Iran, and opinions on professional wrestling.  Humorous interactions with the hosts concluded the segment. The show then transitioned to a discussion of Opie's recent breakup and his emotional state, with his co-hosts offering their perspectives.

The show continued with a discussion about hockey's declining popularity, attributed to player strikes and owner indifference.  This segued into a discussion about crying, with Opie recounting crying while watching "Little People, Big World." Callers shared their own emotional moments.  The conversation took an unexpected turn with a caller, Jackie, describing her knife-related sexual fetish. This led to a detailed discussion and Jackie, along with her roommate Rob, eventually appearing in the studio to demonstrate the act.  E-Rock, Big Kev, and other guests were present in the studio during this segment. Jackie showed her “knife wounds” before leaving.

A later segment started with more listener calls detailing knife-related sexual fetishes and transitioned into a silent game featuring knife-scraping sounds on a woman's body. Listeners called in to comment.  The hosts jokingly suggested an encore, leading to a sound effect of a woman being repeatedly stabbed, causing a startled reaction. The show then shifted to a discussion of the Blue Angels flyover during Fleet Week, with Opie expressing 9/11-related anxiety.  This transitioned into a humorous critique of *Top Gun*, focusing on its homoerotic undertones, especially the volleyball scene, with listener participation.  The segment concluded with a lengthy, humorous account of Opie accidentally holding hands with a man he mistook for his girlfriend during a Mets game, including detailed descriptions of the man's hands.  The segment ended with a sound effect and birthday wishes for Drew Boogie, a studio sound mixer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All sports all the time.  No excuses.  Sports Radio 1140 KSFM.  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen.  Some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful. 
[00:00:30]  Mancations on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I don't get the mancation thing.  This caused a big controversy, if I remember.  Some people for the mancation.  Others against it.  Some people think it's a great way for the guys to get away from the wives and everything.  I happen to think it's like one of those HBO late night shows  where guys are naked in the jungle, pounding on bongos, hugging each other.  Or it's an excuse for all these guys to go away and cheat.  On their wives. 
[00:01:00]  That's true.  Their wives are thinking,  Ah, he can't possibly be cheating on me.  He's away with his friends on a mancation playing golfing.  Mancation.  And renting really expensive sports cars.  It would be called a cheatcation if he was cheating.  Right.  Right, girls.  I don't know.  There's something going on with these mancations.  And we explore that in this next segment.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We've been on this for a while.  Well, this is the latest story on mancations.  I personally don't get it.  So a bunch of guys go away together. 
[00:01:30]  It's the continuing feminization of men.  It's this thing.  It's supposed to be a security in your masculinity.  But it really is a way to kind of feminize the men.  This whole metrosexual thing where guys are going out and doing what the ladies are doing.  Getting facials and manicures and stuff.  And saying,  Hey, I'm still, you know, all man.  I'm just taking care of myself. 
[00:02:00]  See.  They give the names like this.  What happened?  When you watch The Deer Hunter.  Right.  Is that considered a mancation?  When they all went out and almost shot Fredo in the head?  No, but it is when they're over there being forced to play Russian roulette.  That's a mancation.  Now that's a mancation.  Here's the idea.  It's supposed to be like a bunch of boys just being boys and getting away from the gals.  That's where it comes from.  It's not just guys going out. 
[00:02:30]  There has to be some female involvement, some way they're getting away from the girls to say,  Look, guys, now's our chance to just be the men that we know we are.  Totally disagree.  Because our girls told us we can leave.  Totally disagree.  And do something.  Totally disagree.  Really?  That's how it's being presented to the men out there by the travel agents.  But the reality is it's a bunch of guys getting together and banging prostitutes and getting away with murder.  If that's what it is.  Getting away with murder.  But then they do these stories and go, No, we're just old college buddies and decide we want to go away and hang out and catch up and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  No way.  Well, that's fine.  If that's what it is.  If it's to get away from your wife and pay for sex, I have no problem with it.  I've taken mancations.  I'm not married.  We went to Brazil.  Maybe not even pay.  I'm sure some, yes.  But maybe as innocent as just going to strip clubs with your old college buddies and stuff.  But to make believe you're just hanging out, playing golf and having a nice dinner afterwards and all that is BS. 
[00:03:30]  It's doing something sexual.  Whether it's strip clubs.  There's something sexual involved in this.  Absolutely.  I didn't see it that way.  I see it as these bunch of, like, with guys that just decide that they have to, you know, hey, I'm still all man.  Watch what I do because she told me I could.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or maybe a little bit of both.  Maybe, you know, some people are using it for one thing.  I think the sex angle's in there somewhere.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  Why else go anywhere?  I mean, we flew below the equator to pay for sex with indigenous people.  How fantastic that was.  There's no language spoken.  You hand over reals and the next thing you know, you're having sex with a stranger.  Fantastic.  And their mouth also smells like mouthwash.  In between trips, they go and use, like, a mouthwash to close any cuts in the mouth.  That's always a lovely feeling.  Really?  Yeah.  People are gargling with alcohol just so they don't transmit anything or catch anything.  How are they cutting their mouth?  Just, like, little teeny cuts that we have as people in our mouths from eating, little teeny microscopic ones. 
[00:04:30]  Alcohol helps to close them.  Or they just eat a box of Captain Crunch with no milk?  Leave those shards of flesh hanging from the top of your mouth?  It's Copacabana, Brazil.  They don't have a lot of cash.  In Rio, there's not a lot of money there, so they don't eat anything.  So you're helping the economy.  So you're doing a good job.  Bless you.  God bless you.  That would be a great gag, just, like, eat a light bulb before you go into one of those joints.  There you go.  Just, like, the hooker eats a light bulb.  Come here.  Well, no.  Let's see how desperate you are.  So what's this man-cation?  Oh, the Hillman's doing the 2006 man-cation to Greece? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, wow, wow.  That makes sense.  Wow.  You know what those Greek are into, huh?  Yeah.  What is Greek?  What is going on in man-town?  You ever ask for Greek?  You know what you get when you ask for Greek?  Of course.  You ask for French, you get the top end.  Yeah.  And you ask for Greek?  Wow.  Whoa.  Yeah, you ask for Greek, and you get a girl going, I didn't post that ad.  I don't do that.  Oh, really?  I've said, do you speak Greek?  No. 
[00:05:30]  I did.  The agency posted that.  How about bareback?  No.  I don't do that either.  Yes, I do Greek.  It smells like a gyro.  They had in the paper, I think a week ago, a guy proud of his little spot in his own home  where he gets to just be a man, and it looked like it was like the garage that was half-vanished  or the basement that was half-vanished.  Big smile on his face.  Right, like just a primitive bar he set up and like a Budweiser mirror and an old TV. 
[00:06:00]  He looks at it like, look at what I'm allowed to do.  This is my spot, my home where I could be a man.  And meanwhile, the reality of it is, dude, you lost your house.  You lost the entire house.  You're now relegated to a piece of crap, a corner of a basement, like a kid in a tree fort.  And he was all proud.  You got yourself a tree fort.  You happy?  He was all proud.  Well, here's the ladies on Mancations.  Let's learn some more.  I don't get this.  I don't get this phenomenon where you just go away with a bunch of guys, but it's very  hot these days. 
[00:06:30]  Jerry's dance partner was kind of hot.  Yeah, we said that on Friday.  Yeah, I never saw it.  I never watched one minute of this show.  She was from Australia or something like that.  Is she?  Yeah, she was beautiful.  Wow.  It's a busy life and lots of long distance friendships for Fred McCool and his close buddies.  We all work very hard.  We all have family.  So Fred, his friend Steve, and six other guys started a tradition, an annual golfing getaway.  Yeah, I've seen one.  Golfing getaway means golf and strippers. 
[00:07:00]  Simple as that.  Some of these guys are nerds, too.  A hitter between the first and second hole.  But if you're in a loving relationship, why wouldn't you want to go away with your family  when you finally get vacation time?  Why do you want to escape that unless you're not too happy with your marriage?  It's an age thing, too.  Nobody wants to feel like they're getting older and this is the rest of the world.  Everybody wants to recapture youth.  And a lot of times, youth is just associated with your friends.  His name should be Fred McDouche.  This guy just hangs out with his buddies and plays golf. 
[00:07:30]  What a zero.  So you're thinking like, yeah, he kind of remembers doing that when he was free and younger.  And so now he leaves the wife at home and the kids, goes out with his friends, and all  of a sudden they act like they're youngsters.  With their corn balls.  Drinking, talking to them.  Drinking beer.  Drinking beer.  You remember that time?  You remember that time back, you know, when we were 20 and you did the...  You trade little stories.  Yeah, dirty jokes.  Having beers.  Just awful.  Maybe a strip club.  You know, innocent.  Yeah.  Annual golfing getaway. 
[00:08:00]  I've seen them once a year on this trip.  Travel experts say they're booking more and more men-only trips.  They're becoming so popular, they've actually spawned a name, Mancations.  From golfing to bass fishing, sports trips to VIP and spa packages, there's something for  every group of guys.  Even a Porsche driving experience.  Men have been going...  A Porsche driving experience or a Porsche to get the women while you're away?  Bruds.  Well, some of the stuff is probably just things women don't want to do, like the sporting 
[00:08:30]  stuff.  Chicks want nothing to do with that, and you're tired of being on a trip and having to hear  her nag at you and complain when you want to do what you want to do.  That's part of it.  So you can just hang with your friends because you don't have to curse, tell your wife to  shut her face and sit in the hotel.  And no women involved whatsoever.  I think...  I'm sure on some level it is, but most people...  Do you think that guy with his golf buddies are frequenting a strip club or...  Maybe.  Maybe they have a girl come in and their idea of really sexy is to have her put whipped cream  on her own chest and lick it all.  They think that's really racy and sexy. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  My idea of what...  Hey, what goes on here stays here, guys.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Yeah, but it's just nonsense.  Nothing.  Let's go to George in Jersey.  He says, I'm wrong.  George?  You're dead wrong.  Morning, boys.  Hey, George.  I just got back from a trip with seven guys.  We went to another guy's house in Florida.  You're absolutely right, Opie.  You go play some golf, and then you go to the bar, and maybe you go to some Indian casino,  and for three or four days, you decompress.  You forget about all the...  All right.  They dumped out of you, but basically you said, I'm wrong, but then you said, I'm... 
[00:09:30]  You go to the strip clubs.  You admitted golf, strip clubs.  I'm not saying that you're cheating on your wife, but there's some kind of female element  involved in these mancations.  There has to be.  Like, I get it.  I get spending an afternoon with a few buddies and maybe playing golf or something or going  to a football game and tailgating and doing that whole thing, but you ever go away with  your...  Would you ever want to go away with your friends for a week after an afternoon?  You don't have anything left to talk about. 
[00:10:00]  I've done it, and again, it depends on what your common interest is.  We went away to be filthy in Brazil, so it was worth it because we would just, like,  hang out and go, like, to the whorehouse.  Can you imagine hanging out with Patrice and Rich Voss and Bob Kelly and all those guys  for a week in Florida?  No.  No.  That's what I mean.  I'd like to talk to them and run a gig together.  Guys, we don't have a lot to talk about with each other.  George.  You could spend an afternoon talking to your old pals, but after that, there's nothing  else to talk about.  Yeah.  George.  You know what happens, guys?  If you stop talking and everybody just sits and beats in it, it's quiet. 
[00:10:30]  Because you're absolutely right, Opie.  You know, after the first day, you catch up on all the stuff that's going on.  Then it's just sitting in a room where you don't have to talk to your wife or your kids  or, you know, you don't have to talk about this little piece or that little piece.  Doesn't that kind of show that you're not kind of into your wife and kids?  I don't think so.  It's what?  It has nothing to do with that.  Yeah?  You go away on family vacations and you have fun with your families and that's great. 
[00:11:00]  But then, you know, there are times you just want to, you know, get away for three or four  or five days.  Wouldn't you rather have the freedom to do that maybe like one night, a couple of nights  a week or something?  And every so often you hook up and play cards or something instead of just making it this  big week-long thing?  I could say maybe a weekend, whatever, but when it starts stretching into four or five  days, like, oh, God, what a bore fest.  It's hard for most people.  We don't have kids.  We don't have to get up and deal with kids at two o'clock in the morning.  So a lot of guys can't just have people over for cards. 
[00:11:30]  We date.  Or you're on vacation and you want to be parasailing and scuba diving, doing all this crazy stuff,  but you got the kids with you.  You're like, I don't have time to do it.  So I get it on a level.  But when you're going four or five days, you've got to be a sex element.  You've got to be married.  You've got to have kids to understand.  It's really, it's not a thing about, you know, your wife and kids and not caring about them.  Right.  It's about having some downtime.  Keep telling yourself that.  All right, George.  Thank you.  More of the clips. 
[00:12:00]  Men have been going away together forever on fishing trips and hunting trips, and this  is just becoming a more formalized trend because hotels are making it easier than ever and creating  fun packages, with many even tossing in some manly extras.  They'll do things like have a nightlife concierge who will hook up all your fun activities for  the night, or they'll create a suite so that you have a bucket of beer when you get there  and do fun poker nights.  Poker nights?  Poker.  I believe it was poker, but I wonder if that nighttime concierge is kind of, you know, all 
[00:12:30]  right, I know what you guys are into.  Of course.  I guess she'll be up with a couple of her friends shortly.  I think I'm turning a little bit.  I guess I get it a little bit more, but I don't know.  When it stretches out to, like, a whole week or something, I don't know.  This just seems to me to be this thing.  You don't have permission most of your married time, so this kind of, now you're allowed.  Look at me.  I'm being the man that I am.  Oh, got to get home.  He uses, like, that concierge language, that hotel language. 
[00:13:00]  He won't go, would you like a hooker?  Or he would say something like, if you gentlemen feel like you need a little extracurricular,  like that smug, like, business guy language.  Maybe if you run out of things to talk about, someone else could come up to maybe spice up  the conversation.  You know what I mean, gentlemen?  You know what I mean?  That's right here.  Initial here.  Ha, ha, ha.  Shop.  He put his hand down for his tip.  Oh, we get newscaster banter as they wrap up the story here.  Fred's group is already planning next year's party vacation. 
[00:13:30]  Every guy needs to go out and enjoy themselves and let loose like this.  It's a lot of fun.  Now, all of this, of course, predicated on whether or not your wife will let you out of  the house.  Mancations, of course, vary in costs from hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on where  you stay, what exactly you want to do.  To see if a hotel offers a specific mancation, just check their reservation page under packages  and you can see what exactly they offer.  So, John, what's your mancation brand?  I did a mancation, a golfing mancation.  You know what, good about a mancation, you could be completely stupid. 
[00:14:00]  But no, come on.  I went away to an island, though.  Oh, okay.  Now it's getting better.  Share the room.  Any of those nightlife packages?  Island of homo.  It wasn't a package, but we split the dinner bills, which was good, too.  That's better.  But the mancation, I think we called ourselves Dumb and Dumber on this vacation, which was  completely stupid.  Sounded like a lot of fun.  All right.  Did it.  Water alert in a local name.  Did it sound like a lot of fun?  You and your friend holed up at a motel playing golf. 
[00:14:30]  Calling each other Dumb and Dumber.  Yeah.  Aren't we dumb?  Tee hee.  Awful vacation that was.  All right.  A lot of people say, look, love my wife and kids, just want to get the F away from them  every once in a while.  You know what?  I will just admit that I don't know anything about this.  We don't have the wife.  We don't have the kids.  So it just seems weird to us, but he goes on mancation.  Right.  That'll be used in political ads.  Maybe it makes sense.  Maybe it says that. 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I don't know where I'm at with this.  I think some of it, like Jim said, the dark side.  Yeah.  Where you're going in, you're having the sex, whatever.  The sex.  And then others, it's innocent, stupid, boring chitchat.  Bruce from Louisiana wasn't Brokeback Mountain a mancation.  Yeah.  Yeah, that certainly was.  You know, there's a guy, we don't have time to go to the phones, unfortunately.  Maybe we could bring this up again tomorrow because, you know, there's a guy who wants  to talk about how he's going on a motorcycle run with 12 guys, you know, hunting trips every 
[00:15:30]  day, you know, four-day hunting trips.  So, I guess it's fair to say we don't know because we don't have the wife and the kids.  So, you're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America where we love to make fun of  everything.  No more need to search all over the dial for sports.  You've found it.  Dan Patrick is back in Las Vegas at 9.  Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today. 
[00:16:00]  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Jane's back.  Jane?  We can't get this done, though, Jane.  Jane's from Chicago.  Oh, right, okay.  She's a deaf friend of Karen Meyer.  Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter.  We make fun of because it's just hilarious to see someone on TV that's deaf trying to  do TV news.  I'm sorry.  I heard you talking about Jane.  It's a freak show.  I didn't think that that was appropriate.  She does.  She does the reports on handicapped people.  Right.  They give her the story. 
[00:16:30]  She's deaf, so she can't really speak that well because she's deaf.  And her friend Jane is calling to defend her.  Her friend Jane, also deaf, has to use some kind of a relay thing.  Right.  She uses a relay service.  She's going to try this again.  So we talk, and then somebody types it.  Right.  She then sees it at her house and has to, I guess, type in what she wants to say back,  and then the person, the intermediary there, talks to us.  It's a nightmare. 
[00:17:00]  We'll try it again.  All right.  Let's see what she has to say.  Jane, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is for an IP relay operator, 253.  And you know how to use the relay service?  I have no idea how we use the relay service.  Miss, this is on the air, by the way.  I'm still going to explain the relay.  Okay.  The person on the line is using a free Internet service to communicate with you.  The person is going to type their conversation, and I'm going to read it to you.  Okay.  And when you hear the words go ahead, it means it's your turn to speak.  And at that point, I ask you to speak directly to the caller,  and everything that is heard will be typed to them verbatim. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Who starts?  I'm going to type that to her, and then she'll begin one moment, please.  All right.  You guys, let's try to talk one at a time.  Maybe that will help this whole process.  And I don't appreciate the tomfoolery, by the way.  That's right.  No.  Here's Jane.  She's deaf.  She's going to defend Karen Meyer.  Okay.  The deaf reporter out of Chicago that makes us laugh on a daily basis.  She didn't hear that.  Oh.  Thank you for holding me.  Let's begin.  Me, you mean-spirited people. 
[00:18:00]  Go ahead.  Oh, that's us?  So it's our turn?  Go ahead.  It means it's your turn.  We're not mean-spirited.  We just like to laugh.  We like to laugh.  We like to laugh.  This takes a while, I guess.  It's okay.  They haven't figured this one out.  Oh, go ahead.  Oh.  We got to do the go-ahead part.  Go ahead.  Roger Wilco.  People laugh at you and not with you. 
[00:18:30]  Go ahead.  No, she said, wow, really?  No, I think people are laughing with us and not at us.  I think it's hilarious that there's a deaf reporter on TV giving us the news.  She's there for us to laugh at.  Go ahead.  What did they do before technology? 
[00:19:00]  They just punch deaf people.  It is not nice to make fun of people who are hearing impaired.  It is not our fault.  We try our best.  She is not there to laugh at.  She is trying her best.  Go ahead.  Well, what does it matter because you can't hear what we're saying about you?  Go ahead. 
[00:19:30]  Is that good?  That was a good one, right?  Thank you.  Kind of makes sense.  I didn't even think about it like that.  How can the deaf get mad?  The deaf and the Amish, I think, is the safe bets because they're not going to hear what we have to say.  The Amish is safe from being moved on for like a week.  Go ahead.  My friends tell me you are stupid and dumb.  Go ahead. 
[00:20:00]  Go ahead.  Why are your friends listening to this show?  We're despicable human beings.  And how do you hear them with those two candy dishes hanging on the sides of your head?  Go ahead.  We're having an argument with a deaf person.  An argument.  How awful are we?  Over the radio.  By the way, it's time to take it up a notch. 
[00:20:30]  Head.  Who's with me?  Oh, no.  All right.  Don't make fun of them.  Why do you have to make fun of everyone?  Are you uncomfortable with yourself?  Go ahead.  We like to make fun of easy targets because they can't fight back.  Go ahead.  Being honest.  Man, this arguing with a deaf person takes a long time.  It takes so long. 
[00:21:00]  Well, look around your room.  A lot of easy targets.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Would that just be LOL?  Good.  It's worth it because you guys are mean people who should just leave and let Whoopi take over. 
[00:21:30]  Go ahead.  Why don't you just, why don't you shut up and take your pristine iPod earplugs and throw them away?  Go ahead.  That Whoopi take over.  Wake up to silence.  Go ahead.  And you have to write that we sang it.  Yeah.  Musical notes around it. 
[00:22:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Boy, I feel bad for the poor girl that's typing.  Oh, yeah.  That's a horrid job.  No kidding.  It's thankless.  You must have said a lot there.  By the way, just the way the other one fights back, you are dumb and not nice.  I know.  Jesus, how old are you?  It's like the, it's the least bit of information possible they put out, you know? 
[00:22:30]  I think we should all just get together and play Twister and have a good time.  Let's all just blow over.  Go ahead.  Would you, would you be comfortable drinking out of our mules?  Go ahead.  Oh, very good, Jimmy.  By the way, Operator Chick, you sound really hot.  That's not for her.  That's for you.  A lot of people checking in.  A lot of people saying that.  Yeah.  Operator Chick.  She's supposed to remain neutral.  I understand that.  Not about her. 
[00:23:00]  But she heard and she knows.  Yeah.  She knows she's sexy.  She probably wore a little skirt.  A little short skirt.  The thighs are showing.  Hey, everything Jimmy says, could you just type exclamation points after it?  Yeah, he loves exclamation points.  He talks like that.  Don't talk to the operator.  Talk to me.  Right.  Oh, right.  Me.  You being the deaf girl.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  You have to be her either.  What did she just say?  What a great life that's got to be.  Over. 
[00:23:30]  Go ahead.  Roger Wilco.  Hey.  And do you think, do you think the operator would be up for a good shish-kebobbing?  We must be doing well if the deaf people know about the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Let's be honest here.  This is.  I said talk to me and explain why you like.  Nazis and tormenting homeless.  Go ahead.  Well.  It speaks for itself.  Oh, do I have to step in here? 
[00:24:00]  We don't want to talk to you because it takes too long for a response.  We will talk to you.  I'm talking to you now.  How hot do you think the woman typing is?  Go ahead.  And do you think she's a two, a two or a three hauler?  Go ahead.  Feel bad for the operator.  She has to type whatever we say.  I know. 
[00:24:30]  It's horrible.  I've liked Twister ever since I was a child.  Good, stupid, white, black people.  Homey boys who eat spinach every day.  Go ahead.  Do you think the operator has ever laid down with a Negro?  Go ahead.  You have to type it, operator.  That's your job.  Of course.  She knows her job.  Her job.  She's probably heard worse.  I don't know when.  Oh, by the way.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah, she sounds high. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Oh, hey.  Wow.  Do you think she said that?  Or is that the operator just, like, pushing herself?  The deaf lady probably said something else stupid, like, you're dumb, be nice.  Childlike, idiotic, arguing skills.  The operator's all saucy. 
[00:25:30]  Well, I don't know where this is going.  Well, let's talk to the deaf.  Deaf broad.  Is there something you do special in bed to make up for the fact that you can't hear?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I don't hear any typing.  I don't hear typing.  It's happy typing.  I think the operator likes when people have cyber on this thing. 
[00:26:00]  I like to scream a lot.  Go ahead.  The deaf girl likes to scream a lot when she's having sex?  Yeah, but she's just yelling, why?  Why?  She can't hear what's going on.  That's got to be creepy.  Are you a size queen?  Go ahead.  We should ask how she knows so much about the show. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I think we're on DirecTV, right?  Yeah, but you can't watch us.  No, I think they might have closed caption.  Are you kidding me?  Do they have closed caption on DirecTV?  That would be amazing.  Because how does this deaf girl know all about us?  How does this girl read?  Go ahead.  We got one more coming after she responds?  All right.  We usually call those hotlines through this thing.  It is fun.  Friends tell me and can get it put into words on the Internet. 
[00:27:00]  The Internet.  All right.  We got one more from Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Functious!  Go ahead.  You know, this Jane girl, I think she's all right, actually.  This operator's a goer.  Yeah, this operator's a goer.  Can the operator tell us where she is? 
[00:27:30]  Wow, she knows how to type.  She's good.  I would hope so.  Absolutely.  We're just about done with this, right?  Wow, this is hard.  I think the operator is under your desk.  Go ahead.  Very nice.  All right, listen.  We got to wrap up because we got to do radio for people that could hear.  Yeah.  Jane in Chicago, let's not forget that Karen Myers is being exploited by that TV station 
[00:28:00]  there in Chicago.  No one is watching Karen Meyer because she's a brilliant journalist.  They're watching because it's a freak show, and that's the reality of what's going on  in Chicago.  Go ahead.  I think this is Karen Meyer.  I don't know the name.  No.  You don't think so?  Well, wait a minute.  We haven't heard a talk.  Why can't we just hear her make a noise?  Yeah.  Well, then with that, maybe Jane could call up the show, and we could just yell at her. 
[00:28:30]  Tell her to sing.  She probably sounds like Young Frankenstein.  Love you guys.  Punching out.  Go ahead.  Signing off.  All right.  See?  She listens to the show.  Listens.  Thank you, hot operator chick.  All right, operator.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, boy, she didn't sound happy having to deal with that part of the conversation.  That's what she'd be.  Thank you.  Rich and Paramus, what's up?  You know, I just drove into a pole listening to that.  No. 
[00:29:00]  No, no.  No one ever actually really drives into a pole.  A pole or a wall or an abutment.  All right.  You know, if you imagine somebody tuning in for the first time and hearing that, they're  not going to know what that thing is, public access or something.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Jack in Westchester.  Jack.  Best bit ever.  Frankus.  Frankus.  Frankus, go ahead.  I don't know.  That was a fan suggestion.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  She doesn't even care.  Like, she just typed it up.  She was miserable.  How could she not be?  We were asking if the operator of a Ben and Negro.  She doesn't want to hear that.  Awful.  We made it work finally, because that Jane girl's been calling our show here and there  for the last month.  Apparently a friend.  All right.  Fan of the show.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Geraldo Rivera, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  It's not about you, Jim, because a legend is walking into the studio. 
[00:30:00]  The legend.  Not that legend.  Another legend.  Ah, there he is.  Hey, what's up?  The man, everybody, I love to hate.  It's the Iron Sheik.  Back in the old days.  The Iron Sheik.  There he is.  Look at you.  You look just like you did back in the old days.  Thank you, sir.  Are you Anthony or Opie?  I am Anthony.  That is Opie.  First of all, pleasure for me.  Can you guys bring me from Olympic City, Atlanta, Georgia, to the Big Apple, the most famous 
[00:30:30]  city in the world.  That's why I come three times champion World Wrestling Federation.  They are in the most famous arena in the world, Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  All right.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, to the lesson, to the number one station in  America.  It's a pleasure to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Very good.  Thank you.  So much.  Wait, what?  Iron Sheik.  Thank you, sir.  And what the hell are you doing with yourself these days? 
[00:31:00]  Well, I'm here.  My agents, Steve Kaplan, called me from Georgia and bring me to Big Apple.  We have a couple autographs section.  This coming.  Wow.  So back in the day, I mean, everyone, you were a pretty bad guy.  Well, you know.  People didn't like you.  It was during.  I know what you mean.  I didn't involve with the politician or Ayatollah Khomeini, but I grew up with all my life  with the toughest sport in the world, freestyle and Greco-Roman, to I come wrestling with 
[00:31:30]  the Mr. McMahon World Wrestling Federation.  Right.  And I come three times WWF champion besides Olympic, besides AAU, besides World Games.  I remember all the great matches against you and Sergeant Slaughter.  Yes.  Exactly.  Had a lot of good ones during the Gulf War time period.  Right.  Yeah.  Very big.  Very big.  I remember that.  Especially that camp would match.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Yes.  And then you came out, you'd wave the flag, and everyone would throw stuff at you.  Well, you know, because I was a rare Antony Parishian man, all this country in the world. 
[00:32:00]  But I'll be honest with you, I didn't grow up with the politician.  No.  I grew up with the sport, toughest sport, in the Olympic, freestyle and Greco-Roman.  So you never wanted to get rid of America or anything for real, right?  Not really, because, you know, I know I born in all this country in the world, Tehran,  Iran, but I made it in America, greatest country in the earth, especially the most famous  arena in the world, Madison Square Garden, and I have a lot of friends. 
[00:32:30]  He mentions the garden more than Dice does.  Right.  I have a lot of friends.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans in the Big Apple.  Yes.  And also Iranian people.  And I love to you people wrestling today, number one station in America.  You didn't just give all the cab drivers a code word to run people over, did you?  And sir, what country are you from?  I'm originally from all this country in the world, Iran. 
[00:33:00]  Iran.  Iran.  Tehran.  Tehran.  Really?  Tell us a little bit about that.  I love Iran.  Iran.  How old were you when you left Iran?  My last Olympic, I competed in 1968, Mexico City.  I was a coach for University of Minnesota, 1969 and 1970, and I went to Olympic Munich, Germany.  And after Munich, Germany, 72, I turned professional, and then I made it in Big Apple. 
[00:33:30]  So you left...  Wait, wait, wait.  You made it in the Big Apple.  Where did you make it in the Big Apple?  Well, Mr. McMahon, senior, God bless you so.  Yes.  He passed away, and then they found out...  Arsenio died?  What just heard?  Did I hear?  No, it was career.  Well, that was his father, Mr. McMahon, senior.  No, but you made it...  Oh, senior.  Okay.  Not junior.  And he made it in the Big Apple.  Where did you make it in the Big Apple there?  Well, I made it in the Big Apple, too.  I come for wrestling in the most famous arena in the world, Madison.  Oh, right. 
[00:34:00]  That's right.  Yes, sir.  You have big matches there, huh?  Yes, sir.  And the bell.  I come single champion, and Nicola and I become tag team champion, and also by the road, three  times.  Really?  Three times?  Yes, sir.  And you'd come out, and you'd wear what was thought to us as traditional Iranian garb.  You'd have the curly shoes on.  Absolutely.  I remember that.  And you'd wave the flag, and people would yell and scream horrible things at you.  And Sergeant Slaughter would come in and start beating you up, and everyone would cheer. 
[00:34:30]  Not really, Ivan.  You're right.  Maybe he can beat me once a while, but most of the time, I was a winner, especially I beat  that Hollywood blonde, Jabroni Hogan, and Madison Square Garden, New York.  And six years, nobody beat Mr. Bob Backlund, also I beat him in the garden.  Bob Backlund?  Yes, sir.  Mr. Bob Backlund.  Bob Backlund.  Backlund.  But the people, you're right, Anthony, or of you, because people didn't like me because  I used to cheer the Ayatollah Khomeini flag, and I was a real country, man. 
[00:35:00]  Well, you know what?  His famous line there was, Iran is the best, and then he would spit.  Right.  I don't know whenever I told you.  I used to say, yeah, Russia, number one.  Iran, number one.  Right.  USA, ah, poof.  But no, I don't say anymore.  No, you better not.  No, I say, no, it's not really the climate to say that now, right?  Right.  Have you noticed maybe that act wouldn't play too well these days, right?  Not really, because, you know, like I said, I borrow a country, but I made it in America. 
[00:35:30]  Greatest wrestling country, greatest country on earth.  You ever do a Duck Jam audience?  You ever do Duck Jam?  Never did Jeff Comedy Jam.  Shut up, Foss.  No, I'm not into the comedy.  Not into the comedy.  My partner is on the comedy.  Because I heard somebody had called us up and said that the Iron Sheik was doing stand-up comedy.  No, sir, somebody else used my name.  He uses your name.  Right, and then they did that.  But I'm the only one from all this country in the world.  Tehran, Iran.  Tehran, Iran.  And then you came here to the U.S., and you were at, what was that big place that you wrestled at? 
[00:36:00]  Madison Square Garden, New York.  Madison Square Garden, number one.  Number one arena, the most famous arena in the world.  Of course.  Madison Square Garden, New York, number one.  Now, also, I want to know about, who's the Russian guy?  Nikolai Volkov.  Nikolai Volkov.  Remember that?  They would come out, and it was all, we hated you.  And I heard you had some problems at an airport.  Is that true?  Well, I've been to the airport in Georgia, usually, since September 11th. 
[00:36:30]  And at that time, the Middle East, maybe I'm involved with the tourists, but I'm not really.  I grew up with the toughest sport in the world, wrestling.  But they check me, and they take my tennis shoes off.  They take my socks off.  They check me out, and then they found out I'm Iron Sheik.  I give them a couple of pictures.  Everybody was happy.  Oh, is that it?  Yes, sir.  So they found out you were the Iron Sheik, and no problem with your shoes.  No problem with it.  You weren't wearing them curly shoes, though.  Yes, sir.  That's an alteration in all countries. 
[00:37:00]  We used to wear it.  Walked up.  But you don't walk through an airport security with the curly shoes on.  Well, you know, I mean, that was it.  If you want to get on the plane quickly, I'd recommend not wearing the curly shoes.  Leave them at home.  Yes, sir.  Not anymore, because, you know, that was a custom of them.  It is custom, but from since that, you're right.  Anthony, I don't wear it anymore.  Right.  But what's with the curly shoe?  Well, that's an alteration in all countries.  The oldest country.  Right.  Oldest Tehran, Iran.  And we walked up the sand. 
[00:37:30]  We don't get burned.  Our feet doesn't get burned.  To walk through the sand?  Right.  But sometimes I have a lot of camel.  I do with it.  We call car one.  And then I kill all the camel all night.  The camel?  Yeah, the camel.  I hear you.  Yes.  Whatever happened to Bob Backlund and Sergeant Slaughter?  Well, Bob Backlund and Sergeant Slaughter is one of the agents and still is an employee  for the WWF.  I want to know where he defeated Hulk Hogan. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, you did that at a big match with Hulk Hogan.  That was Madison Square Garden.  It was.  It was Madison Square Garden.  I remember that.  Like it was yesterday.  What do you think about Hulk Hogan being back with the WWF?  Oh, good question.  Thank you, Woppy.  Mr. McMahon is a genius.  Yes.  He's a smart number one promoter in the world.  He knows if there's some talent like Hulk Hogan or some another, they can bring the people, 
[00:38:30]  put on the seat for his company.  Right.  And always he hired again.  And age doesn't matter.  And as long as they know the talent, there are money for his company.  Exactly.  And he's the best promoter.  Well, that's why I bring him back.  That's what I'm getting to now.  Any chance of maybe seeing the Iron Sheik back with the WWF?  I'm on the road.  I'm 27 years old.  I prefer to be...  You're 37 years old?  37 years old.  I'm on the road.  Oh, you're on the road.  I was going to say.  You know, you're kind of skirting your age a little. 
[00:39:00]  You might want to pump it up a little bit.  37 to the third power.  You know.  Pump it up a little higher.  I'm happy for you to share my experience for freestyle Greco-Roman and professional to all young Americans.  Greco-Roman.  I like how he says that.  Right.  Greco-Roman and freestyle.  Freestyle Greco-Roman.  Toughest sport in the world.  One and one.  It's not Michael Jordan's sport or not football.  It's innovation.  One and one.  And that's two men. 
[00:39:30]  Now they get in a ring.  And what do they got to do?  Greco-Roman.  That's not the Greco-Roman.  That's a professional.  Like, when speaking, we are entertained.  Right.  So that's the real, like, wrestling where you got to do the holds and pin and...  Exactly.  I heard that started out.  The men were nude doing this back in the olden days in, what, Greece?  Well, that was the thousand, maybe a thousand, thousand years ago.  That was the Greek.  That was the first Olympic, as a matter of fact, was the Greek.  Those Greeks, they want to be naked with each other, the men, right? 
[00:40:00]  That's their business.  That's their business, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We call that prison.  Nothing like that happens in Tehran, Iran.  Not really, no.  Because Tehran, Iran, there are serious people, Islamic.  They seem like serious people.  And then we have a lot of great wrestlers, like Takti, Habibi, Zandi, and we never go in the mat to be nude.  Are you famous in Iran?  I'm the Shah of Iran.  His wife, Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.  His wife, Farah Pahlavi. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  I was three years bodyguard.  Oh, you were the bodyguard.  Yes.  So the Shah, you were a bodyguard?  I was the Shah of Iran.  You couldn't guard against that cancer, though, could you?  Well, you know, the reason I had that job and worked at the National Iranian Television  because I was an Iranian, Greco-Roman, and freestyle wrestler.  Greco-Roman.  Right.  Right.  And they gave me that job.  Boy, good thing you got when the getting was good.  I don't think when the Ayatollah got into power, I don't think the bodyguards of the Shah  were popular guys, you know what I mean?  Not that time, right. 
[00:41:00]  No, no.  You've got to get your curly shoes and run your ass off out of that country.  Absolutely.  Yes, sir.  Because you have Greco-Roman, they have guns.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  Since Ayatollah took over, he was a position of the Secret Service, Savak, Royal Army, Navy,  and that was different timing.  But I was your country before that revolution.  Yeah, well, good thing.  Glad to have you.  You gave us a lot of entertainment over the years.  What does he think of today's wrestling there?  Today, wrestling still is the number one sport in your country, America, or in the world, 
[00:41:30]  because one of the top shows in your country, television, is the World Wrestling Federation.  And people watch wrestling more than football or any other sport.  And I remember I wrestled in Nikola and I, Pontiac, Michigan, 93,000 people can't watch that much.  Nobody sold out Pontiac, Michigan.  Pontiac, Michigan.  Yeah.  Pontiac, Michigan.  Exact board wrestling federation.  That was a big arena there at the, what is that called? 
[00:42:00]  Yes, sir.  Yes, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  The place of Pontiac, uh...  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  So, anyway, I want to say again...  What's the one in New York?  Does that hold more people or less than Pontiac?  Oh, well, I'm so sorry about that.  That one.  25,000.  25,000.  So, more in Pontiac, Michigan.  I hear.  Do you have a television set?  Do you have a TV?  In all countries, no.  But I have a TV in Georgia.  See, Norton?  He's got a TV.  Get a goddamn television.  I need a TV, sir.  What's wrong with you?  Again, I want to say thank you for number one station in America. 
[00:42:30]  Pleasure to talk to you guys.  All right.  Great.  Iron Sheik.  I want to say again hello to all my wrestling friends in New York.  And especially all American, Perigian, Middle Eastern, wherever.  God bless you, everybody.  Pleasure to come back again one more time to talk to Anthony and Opion.  Right.  God bless you guys.  Have a good day.  Anthony and Opion.  Thank you, Iron Sheik.  And what about Madison Square Garden?  Madison Square Garden.  The most commissary in the world.  And number one.  Ya Allah, Ya Muhammad, Ya Ali. 
[00:43:00]  Thank you.  There he goes.  The Iron Sheik.  The freestyling Greco-Roman.  Greco.  Iron Sheik.  Oh, no.  There goes the Sheik.  Look at this guy.  You're not going to kill him.  Okay.  You're a big guy.  I wouldn't mess with you.  He's a big guy.  Look at him.  I know.  Give him a couple pictures of everybody.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Give a picture.  Come here, you big bastard.  Look at you.  Who's more out of it?  How are you done?  Oh, look at Sheik.  I got an Iron Sheik hug.  Thank you, my friend.  Give it up to me.  Thank you, my friend. 
[00:43:30]  Give to me a picture.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Iron Sheik.  I got mine, Iron Sheik.  Yes.  There you go.  Okay.  Thank you, my friend.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  All sports all the time.  No excuses.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan.  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:00]  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  By the way, before we move on, someone's got...  What?  What happened?  No, the empty seat.  I was pointing at Greg's here who was the empty seat.  What?  What?  If you was the empty seat supporter.  Oh, no.  Okay.  What is this girlfriend?  I wasn't a...  We didn't break up.  Oh, this is some...  This is...  Oh, this is the...  You broke up with your girl.  Well...  I didn't feel no magic there anyway, dude.  No.  Wasn't no magic there.  I saw...  I met his...  I met...  I'm good at that, man.  I met his magic with him...  You and your girl.  Yeah.  I never really see you guys together. 
[00:44:30]  You and your girl.  It's like weird.  I hope he doesn't take her out.  It's weird.  It's only certain circumstances.  No, when I see you together, it's never enough where I can get a magical...  Where I can feel something.  Well, it's usually during radio events.  Yeah.  I have to worry about so much crap.  Right.  But this new one here...  Because when I first met Norton, I hated his...  I hated Norton with a passion.  We did a gig up in somewhere where it snows even in the summer.  Was it college?  No.  It was someplace where... 
[00:45:00]  He brought his girl and he was just...  It was a six-hour drive and I had no car.  Just got there.  Just met Norton.  Oh, yeah.  We had met before then, though.  Oh, I hated him.  And he was just...  He was just oodly-boodly with his girl for six hours.  I'm in the back like...  Oodly-boodly.  I'm in the back like a slave, like a...  I'm sitting back there like, hey, let's do some comic talking, you know, about life.  And he's just like...  And driving down Route 17 with no lights.  And it's just like...  But he loved that girl. 
[00:45:30]  This new one there that you just broke up with?  Nah.  I didn't feel it.  It was supposed to go anyway.  I don't know, man.  I didn't feel it.  I didn't feel it at all.  I saw it.  That should help him today.  Nah, it should help.  Get ready.  Norton, you're a celebrity, dude.  I'm a...  I'm a...  Oh, boy.  No, I'm not.  He's going to tell you exactly.  What are you hurt about?  He goes, I'm a...  No, I'm not.  There it is.  What does she enable for you to miss her now?  What do you miss?  I don't...  Well...  It's your own ego that's acting up.  It's not even a miss thing because I'm so angry that I don't think I would want to repair 
[00:46:00]  it even if I could.  What does she do?  Just...  We just fought, you know?  What does she do?  It's good that anger's there instead of like complete like just sadness.  Wait, what does she do?  What did she do to you?  Oh, nothing.  Why are you mad?  We just fought.  You know how it is.  You fight and it's just ugly.  It gets ugly.  And you got rid of her?  It was mutual.  No, I can't say I did.  It was mutual.  You're going to come crawling back to her?  No.  It's over.  Good.  We're done.  Now, replay.  Now, how many women do you think the void... 
[00:46:30]  How many...  How much emptiness do you have now?  Five women?  How tall am I?  Five.  There was...  How many women do you think...  Oh, my God.  How many women do you think...  Let me enjoy that one.  How many women do you think...  It's like a science project.  It will take to fill that void now.  I don't know.  Let's see.  We started last night.  $300.  No, man.  The chase of square girls.  You got to chase the square girls.  I completely get that.  But 2.30 in the morning, kind of hard to fight a square girl.  You got to get a circle off Craigslist. 
[00:47:00]  So, it was sexual emptiness?  No.  Partial.  But no, no, no.  That's not...  I can't even...  I won't knock her for that.  No, that was more my thing, actually.  No.  He doesn't want to trash either, so he's...  No, I can't.  No, I won't.  I won't trash.  That's not Jimmy's thing.  It is Jimmy's thing.  Who are you...  Do you even know him?  No, not trashing like this close.  Oh, in like a couple of weeks?  Forget it.  Yeah, I can't.  He'll be, you know, calling her awful things.  Are you going to take her back?  He's sad.  No, she doesn't want to get back with me.  I don't want to get back with her.  There's nothing she wants to get back and I don't or I want to and she doesn't. 
[00:47:30]  He's sad.  It all happened two nights ago and we're not going to talk.  That's it.  I know it's it.  Look at his eyes.  Has all the stuff been removed from your place?  Anything that was hers?  While we were arguing.  While you were arguing that was happening?  Wow.  Are you serious?  Wow.  Your mansion is now empty?  Well, there was never much there.  It was just a few pair of panties and, you know...  Oh, I'm going through it now, dude.  I mean, it ends up, you know, with her coats in my closet.  I'm just like, wow. 
[00:48:00]  I got a million coats and jackets.  I'm looking at what's this?  What's this girl's fur coat doing in my jacket?  Sweetie, can you get your...  Wow, you're that territorial where you don't even want...  Because that's where it starts.  It starts there.  It starts.  And then before you know it, what?  Before you know it, I can turn around and it's just...  Everything is everywhere.  I banish her stuff to where I never see it.  That's why Patrice is brilliant.  Dude.  Spanish.  Her stuff.  Patrice is going to be doing a relationship... 
[00:48:30]  His relationship show in November.  In November.  Yep.  25th.  Yeah, then Black Phillip.  On XM exclusively, right.  A couple weeks.  No, a week from Saturday.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Mike, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But I'm saying she knows.  My girl knows that I am looking for the big fight because I've had no other women in my  house.  In my crown molding painted house.  I have had no one in there except for her and her kid.  So you're looking for the big fight. 
[00:49:00]  I'm just...  She knows I'm sniffing out something.  So she's got to go.  Like, if you're going to have a fight with a girl...  Yeah, bitch, you know, and she just goes.  If you're going to have a fight with a woman, it's going to be a big one and it's going to  be her because who else are you going to fight with?  I got to have a big fight with her so I can have some...  She knows I'm waiting to have somebody else come in there.  Are you serious?  You're not?  Your mansion's empty?  Your mansion tax house with some ungrateful stuff in your house?  Your big Panasonic TV and you all frumpy?  It's ego, stupid. 
[00:49:30]  No, I'll say I know the ego thing.  It definitely is part of it.  But then it's this time where you just get sad because you like somebody a lot.  Maybe you love them.  No, it's the banana in the tailpipe.  Here's why she did that.  She started to fear who you are.  So she tried to control that by leaving you first.  By making the move because you're in a mansion and you're on the radio and she's like,  I'm going to get out of this because I'm a little too in love with you.  That's her problem.  She was too into you knowing she knows it's stupid because you told her,  hey, I'm Jim Norton and I might just not be in here, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:50:00]  And she bounced to save her own life, dude.  That's what she did.  That's what they do.  A preemptive strike?  Yes, to get out of it.  It's self-sabotage.  She's into you too much.  She loves you too much, Norton.  How the hell do you know all this stuff?  Because I know how I am.  I'm dipped in low self-esteem.  It's melting off one layer at a time every 10 years.  And I know how people do things.  Like I said, my girl is engaged to me. 
[00:50:30]  I'm not engaged to her.  She feels more than a girlfriend.  Her love for me is more than a girlfriend.  She's my girlfriend.  I love her.  But she's just my girlfriend right now.  But I don't want to make her not feel like she needs her.  That's what's wrong with women.  And they get to a point where they feel a certain way about you.  And they need you to be exactly the same level.  And you're not.  It's impossible.  Because when you take a woman out, you are auditioning everything to her. 
[00:51:00]  And she's auditioning nothing to you.  So when she's liking you, you're not liking her back.  You understand what I'm saying?  Wow.  To the same degree.  So that she's into you, Norton.  Trust me.  She's suffering.  Where is she going to find somebody else?  You're a winner.  You win a lottery.  You understand?  What other worm does she know that has to pay mansion tax?  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We're really late.  Damn.  By the way, because they're killing me here.  They're killing me here. 
[00:51:30]  The hockey fans checking in.  Hockey hasn't been on ESPN in like two or three years.  No one noticed.  How could they not be so the Nashville Strummers?  See, that just proves that, you know, my owners never got respect because, you know, I didn't  even know because I see them all on all these other crazy channels.  And the O-L-N and Versus.  What are these channels?  The Oklahoma bottom.  No, we can't call them that.  The Detroit Licksplickety's. 
[00:52:00]  The Lickety Splittity's.  No one cares.  Hockey stinks.  The Arizona hotness.  Francis from Long Island.  Patrice, did he catch the L.A. Rapist game against the Portland Baby Daddies?  Wow.  That's black hockey.  Look at a hockey player.  That's the black hockey league.  How did hockey just, it's almost not a sport.  Well, it's Canadian.  They decided it was time to have a little strike like all the other major sports. 
[00:52:30]  And it, uh.  That hurt it.  That hurt it pretty bad.  They haven't fully come back since then.  It took baseball years to come back.  The McGuire Sosa race helped baseball come back.  Yeah.  But hockey was doing well for a while.  The hockey was.  The hockey was.  And it was hot on Fox.  Dude, hockey was really starting to rock.  You're right.  And then they decide.  Jackasses went on strike.  They decide it's time to strike.  And, uh.  And hockey owners are.  They don't care.  They'll just.  They'll just open another pizza shop.  Hockey is a hobby for the owners.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  You're hurting me.  No, no, no.  He might be right.  The Maine lobsters apparently would run some big crowds.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Play sports.  The worst.  I hope he and Anthony.  E-Rock is getting, um, the bush crying audio for us.  He wanted us to stall because he's getting the BB, uh, the BB, uh, the BB, the BB gun  kid audio as well.  BB gun kid.  Yeah, where he cries after getting shot by a BB gun.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  That is a good one.  Well, we like, uh, breaking out the, uh, we like breaking out some of our favorite  crying clips whenever a new one comes about.  Uh, celebrities, sports figures, always good.  Um, retirement speeches, things like that.  Uh, they'll break down, start crying.  You got the Mike Schmidt.  Yeah.  Just, uh.  Famous.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable audio.  And then, uh, politicians, they tend to tear up every so often.  Who was that, uh, woman politician that just lost her mind?  McGreevy. 
[00:54:00]  Like they were saying, it cost her the president, you know, any chance at the presidency or vice  presidency.  A woman?  Yes, abroad.  Oh.  She started crying.  Well, that's not what caused her to lose the chance for the vice presidency.  So it's the fact that there's a mess that is replacing, uh, what makes a man a man.  Right.  Yes.  It's called the irrational hole.  You need something that looks like an intercontinental ballistic missile.  I need to know who this woman is now. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know who you're talking about.  Uh, I can't remember her damn name.  Well, they'll pop it up on instant feedback.  Some, some smarty out there will help us.  Did you ever, uh, did you ever cry watching someone cry?  I know this sounds like a bit we sent back in the back.  Like, it's funny, let me throw this out, but.  I got choked up.  I got choked up.  Uh, uh, the only time I'll get choked up is watching someone getting choked up is, um,  perfect example to watch the last episode of, uh, the band of brothers with the old world 
[00:55:00]  war two guys talking about it's, uh, you know, frigging how many years later, Jesus Christ.  And there's talking about these guys that they fought with and just like, they, they lose  it not completely, but they just kind of, their voice cracks and they, and they got to  kind of stop and pull away a little bit.  And that just gets to me like every time it's like, Oh, this guy is still affected by this  so many years later.  Of course.  I, uh, can I go next?  You got one too?  No, I was just asking. 
[00:55:30]  Do you have one?  I do.  Yeah.  All right.  I, I, uh, I was bawling last night.  Oh no.  What happened?  Oh no.  I hate that.  We're starting to show this personality is wonderful.  Oh, I was watching, um, little people, big world.  Oh no.  Stop.  The midget show.  Get me something hot.  I have.  Get me something hot.  A hot beverage.  I, uh, I can't get it off of little people, big world, hot beverage launcher on, uh, on 
[00:56:00]  TLC.  Yeah.  It is the greatest show.  I discovered it.  Uh, I don't know, last year.  I can't get enough of this dumb thing.  Yeah.  And I, I have a tough time making fun of midgets these days when we do the midget sightings.  It hurts a little because I know they're people just like, Oh no.  So you kind of got a little choked up at the midgets.  So, uh, yeah, little people, big world, they, uh, they focus on this, uh, this one midget,  uh, Zach.  Yeah.  Zach is 13 years old and he's 30, uh, 30 inches tall. 
[00:56:30]  William Bob Kelly's lap at the time.  Yeah.  He's, he's, he's, I guess he's right around.  Yeah.  I think he's just under three feet tall.  Yeah.  And he's 13 and he's got a little like a stubby hands and he, he likes the bowl.  And, uh, does he, his bowling ball is 10 pounds and he weighs 30 pounds.  Wow.  His, his bowling ball only has one hole for the thumb because the other fingers aren't long  enough to get into any other holes. 
[00:57:00]  And then he, he, he throws this ball Cyclops ball with all his might.  And he's actually a really good bowler.  He would probably kick all our asses in bowling, which is pretty, yeah, in bowling.  So I bet I could deck him in a couple of punches though.  You'll beat him in life.  The little fella is on a little people, big world.  And his, and his father is, uh, shipping out to Iraq.  Like, so they, so they, they showed how emotional it is for, for, you know, the father to go  away to war and leave the family behind that. 
[00:57:30]  That's sad.  That's sad for anybody.  I guess his father's of normal size.  Oh yeah.  He's shipping off to Iraq.  He's just, he's his size.  He's a spy.  He just walks into enemy camp and stands around and listens.  No one sees him.  This is a little turd.  This is a turd here.  And, uh, and they had to show the, the, the, the, the, the farewell, the mom and, and  little three foot 13 year old Zach saying goodbye to dad. 
[00:58:00]  Did he throw his little arms around him?  Yeah.  And then, you know, he jumps into mom's arms and he's just inconsolable.  He's just, he's just bawling and wailing.  And then the father just drives off.  And I, I look at, uh, my girlfriend to my right, she's bawling.  And I'm like, all right, what the hell?  I'll let a couple, uh, spill out show that I'm doing too.  I don't want to kill the mood, but that Zach sounds like a bad boy.  This stupid little people, big world.  I can't get enough of it.  Dopey bowling ball. 
[00:58:30]  I know.  It's one hold ball.  He's a tough kid though.  Like every radio show in America.  The show's on, uh, TLC, which is the freak network, by the way.  Tender loving care network.  Oh, the learning channel.  Yeah.  It's the freak network.  It's, it is like, uh, it is the, the, the freak show, the side show for TV.  Yeah.  You know, but, uh.  They do it under the guise that they're showing, you know, diversity and things like that.  But yeah, it is a freak show.  TLC, tiny little creeps.  And naughty Zach. 
[00:59:00]  Like I tell you, it takes a lot for me to get any kind of, uh, you know, moist eyes going.  Emotion.  It takes a lot.  But yesterday, maybe because we were tired from the trip.  I don't know.  See, you're emotionally drained.  I don't know.  But, I mean, seeing any father shipping off to Iraq and leaving a family behind is brutal.  And then to know that this kid has a, has a tough life to begin with and he's losing  his father.  The only one that really, you know, gives a crap about him as a normal person is gone.  The only male that doesn't spit on him when he walks by.  Doesn't do it.  The old, the old, the old dudes though.  It's over, Johnny.  The end, right at the end is this one, uh, one old soldier. 
[00:59:30]  And he goes, he goes, you know, my grandson asked me, were you a hero in the war?  And he goes, no, but I served in a company of them.  Oh, it was like, oh Christ on a bony.  Stop.  How bad do you, how bad do you cry though?  No, it's just like, I get like, like I got to make that loud swallow.  Like, oh Jesus, what, where are you going here? 
[01:00:00]  Stop this.  Turn it off.  Put a cartoon on.  Do you go and make excuses before it gets really bad?  Like, I, uh, I got to go check the water heater.  Like I know, like I know what's coming.  I think there's a leak downstairs.  Oh, you know, guys, we're not supposed to cry ever.  So when it starts happening, you're like, well, you know, you know, that point's coming.  So I grab the water off of my night table and go, oops, and spill it all over my face.  Oh, damn, look.  I spilled water on me. 
[01:00:30]  Or spill it all over the couch.  Oh, wow, look what I did.  I got to go.  I got to go get a rag.  I'll be right back.  Oh, God.  Jimmy, you got one?  I have many.  I'm such a blubber.  The one with personality wise.  I remember watching Ozzy cry, talking about his wife's cancer.  Oh.  That was awful.  Yeah.  Horrible.  But I'm a blubbering idiot anyway.  I mean, I watch movies.  I'm always, I'm the worst.  Are you really?  I'm awful.  Truly awful. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  It borders on manic depressive.  It's not healthy.  It's not like normal.  It's not a healthy release.  No.  It's almost like, I don't care about the movie.  I'm still, it's like, it's just an excuse to finally cry.  What a bunch of washed women.  Oh, we are awful.  We are sissies.  Crying over old soldiers.  He's got fidgets, making him weep.  And you're just bawling over stupid movies.  Isn't it all?  Nothing.  Just a little Mary Ann.  Mary Ann.  I'm a little Marjorie Ann. 
[01:01:30]  Watching Animal House and tearing up at Flounder's dented car.  Oh, I've cried at the dumbest.  I can't even tell you how many movies.  It's revolting.  Look, man.  We're sharing here today.  Oh, no.  And Steven from Bayshore, he writes.  Of course.  Little People, Big World.  I was just talking about it on TLC.  Steve wishes that the show would become Little People, Big Fly Swatter.  Kill those horrid little bastards.  The fans are so awful.  It's like they don't want you to.  I was online one time, and this guy instant messaged me, and he goes, if I hear you talking 
[01:02:00]  about your girlfriend happily one more time, I'm going to slap you in the face.  There's a whole thread on the message board.  Jimmy's got a girlfriend.  Does this suck?  Like, they think it sucks.  I can't help it.  Of course not.  I've seen enough of the other side.  It's all I had.  You should have been with us on the trip then, people, and seen this loving, psychopathic  couple that are absolutely made for each other.  Just not right.  Jesus Christ.  She's as loony as you are.  She's nuts. 
[01:02:30]  She's nuts.  Yeah, definitely entertaining, though.  Hey, Iraq.  Are we waiting for the BB kid still?  Eat to the rock.  What am I doing?  Look at him running over.  That was more like one of those stupid jogs people do across the street when you're waiting  for him to cross.  All right.  That was a half-assed run.  It was awful.  He looked like a fat black man power walking.  That's how Eric runs. 
[01:03:00]  That's really good.  All right.  Hey, no, this isn't Oprah and the Anthony show.  The Oprah and Anthony show.  Oh, what up?  Bunch of crybabies.  People are saying that...  Stop it.  I got the kid's name wrong.  Look, man.  We traveled all day.  It was the little, like, strawberry blonde midget that's only 30-some-odd inches tall.  He's the smallest of the bunch.  The little guy. 
[01:03:30]  He's small.  In the midget world, they look at him and go, wow, you're short.  Oh, that's bad.  I thought his name was Zach.  I still think his name is Zach.  But if you're going to be a short, you should be that short.  Like, just some people go, wow, this is really interesting as opposed to gross.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Be the ultimate short.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Maine.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  What's up?  Yeah.  Well, I heard you guys talking about celebrities and crying and whatnot.  And I even got choked up one time when Andre Agassi retired at the U.S. Open. 
[01:04:00]  He made that speech.  And he was just going on and on and on about everything.  Wasn't he all choked up?  I thought we had that audio.  Did we have that one?  All right.  You cried at this.  Yeah.  Stay on the line.  Maybe we'll get you weeping, too, you little ****.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  This is Andre Agassi.  Well, maybe not.  Is this from recently or no?  Yeah.  At least I get a little teary-eyed with guys recollecting their friends getting blown apart  right in front of them.  This guy is a tennis player.  Yeah.  Guy in white shorts. 
[01:04:30]  I saw this.  Tight white shorts.  And he hits a ball real good.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  So I cried over midget.  I got to stay out of this one.  No, he's just a special ball.  Hey, coach, take me out of the game.  I can't be part of this one.  I'm going to go play with the **** on the other side of the gym.  Over the last 21 years, I have found loyalty.  You have pulled for me on the court and also in life. 
[01:05:00]  I have found inspiration.  You have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments.  And I have found generosity.  You have given me your shoulders to stand on, to reach for my dreams, dreams I could have  never reached without you.  Over the last 21 years, I have found you.  He certainly is whinging.  And I will take you and the memory of you with me for the rest of my life. 
[01:05:30]  You're right.  Thank you.  As I go back to my gated community, I will take you with me.  It's just, you know, Godfather, I need that movie.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  That Andre Agassi clip wouldn't make me cry if I was standing in a barrel of onions.  All right.  Well, that's what makes you cry there, huh, Jesse?  Well, no, I just, I thought he was one of the great...  Ah, Chris in Florida, what's up? 
[01:06:00]  I just can't keep riding the side saddle.  It's always, it's always those movies that have animals in them that die.  Or like A Below or Old Yeller.  Like horse gag?  That one makes me cry with laughter.  Every time she tries to say something right at the end of it.  I'm so jealous of the horse.  Lucky devil you.  He said he would warn me.  Oh, they never do.  I know, you just didn't understand it.  Two taps for get out of the way, sweetie. 
[01:06:30]  All right, what animal movie makes you cry there, Chris?  I don't know how we got on this, but we got to go with this for a little bit.  Oh, you know, I'll sit next to the wife watching a movie like A Below or Old Yeller.  Old Yeller everybody brings up.  She's not crying a bit, and I'm trying to hide it like I'm a man, you know,  and I'm wiping my eye like it itches.  Like he's a man.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I know I'm not, but like I was.  All right.  Someone on the SF feedback on their cell phone.  Opie will crush a homeless man's cake, but he cries at midgets. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, I know.  We were all emotionally a little drained yesterday.  Yeah, Greg of Long Island, what's up?  How about the movie Rudy?  Yeah, if you're not crying at the end of Rudy, man.  No, that didn't do it.  Really?  Yeah, sorry.  It was nice, though, but I don't know.  Pretty inspirational.  Yeah, you get to make a tackle and go home.  That's great.  Oh, well.  48.  Retard.  Exactly.  Stop hanging out with children, you pedophile slash ass.  Oh, you want to talk about an embarrassing real life one? 
[01:07:30]  I forgot about this.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I was strapped in.  It was recently.  It was with my girlfriend.  And we were in bed.  It was dark.  This is true, too.  And I forget what we were talking about, but I was happy to be dating her.  You know, just kind of happy that a lot of the madness or silliness is over.  Yeah.  And I cried a little bit, but it wasn't loud.  It wasn't for showboating purposes.  It wasn't like, you know, we were just laying there talking, and I was, like, getting a  little, you know, worked up. 
[01:08:00]  Nothing crazy.  She had no idea.  A little misty.  Oh, misty.  Exactly.  A little misty.  Jesus.  And she didn't know.  And we're talking, and she starts touching my face, and she feels it, and she didn't know,  and she moved her hand.  She goes, ew, why is your face wet?  Good.  Good for her.  She should have given you one of her tampons to dab your eyes with.  Or I should have shown her a horse gag and said, that would be more dignified than why  it's really wet.  Ew, why is your face wet? 
[01:08:30]  Ew, why is your face wet?  And then she rocks at a watch.  She's like, I'm sorry.  I'm like, it's all right, castrating.  Castrating Hitler Youth.  I'm just laying here.  It's fantastic.  Ew, why is your face wet?  Oh, that's great.  Hey, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, Max.  What's going on, boys?  I've got to agree with Anthony, but one of the sad ones is Saving Private Ryan when the  guy's at the tombstone.  Oh, yeah, that's a bad one.  Okay.  Every time I see that, I fall.  But hey, Anthony, if you don't want to cry anymore, just keep a copy of your bank statement 
[01:09:00]  right there on the table beside you.  Just glance over at it.  Punching out, boys.  No.  I use that on my way to the bank.  It gets me laughing all the way there.  Anthony from Las Vegas.  I cried when Brittany started wearing panties again.  Yeah, that was a very sad day for everybody.  Some things are supposed to make you cry that don't.  Forrest Gump had some sad moments in it, but when he's standing under the oak tree talking  to his wife, who's buried like a German shepherd in the yard.  I know.  No kidding.  It just... 
[01:09:30]  I found it to be more...  I so knew what they were going for, and it annoyed me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The little Forrest is smart.  It was laughable.  Yeah.  It was laughable.  It was a good movie, but that kind of buggy.  Sometimes when they go so far to make you cry...  Yep.  Then it just...  There's nothing there.  No.  It makes you laugh sometimes.  When they try to make you cry, and you're laughing.  How about this one?  How about this one?  This is one of the most famous ones.  Mike Schmidt, everyone.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees, in a dream to become 
[01:10:00]  a Major League Baseball player.  I beg God, the dream came true.  Stop whining.  Almighty.  You know, every time we play that...  Stop it!  Every time we play that clip, by the way, we get hate mail.  People get pissed. 
[01:10:30]  Why?  That we're making fun of that clip.  That's too bad.  They love their schmits.  Why?  I don't mind somebody getting a little choked up.  That was wow.  He was just all up, curled out under an Afghan.  Yeah.  Just letting it fly.  Goddamn Lou Gehrig had to stand there knowing he was going to shake himself to pieces, or whatever  that disease was.  Oh, no.  He turned to cement.  And the guy gave his speech with dignity like a man.  That's right.  Paul O'Neill crying in, like, 97, I think.  There's no audio of it, though, because it was just visual. 
[01:11:00]  It was after the Yanks won the series.  His dad had died that year.  Yeah.  Oh, that was horrible.  Oh, really?  Horrible.  Bad one.  Horrible.  Let's go to Pete.  What's up, Pete?  Hey.  Hey.  What makes me cry is the end of Independence Day when Randy Quaid is going up there with  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up on him.  Hang up on him.  Hang up on him.  Yeah, I felt this.  Shut up.  Okay, I thought he was serious.  Okay, you're kidding.  That's funny.  I thought he was serious.  When Randy Quaid dies because he's, you know, got to fly up into the ship with the missile  and I cried after Will Smith made his first bad joke. 
[01:11:30]  It was a good movie up to that point.  I was really enjoying it.  No, and then he has to turn all urban.  Y'all upset and black folks.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  You don't need that.  Well, here's a good one.  Shucking and jiving.  Exactly.  Well, that I like.  Bruce in Massachusetts.  Bruce.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, sweetie.  How you guys doing today?  Hey.  Good.  What makes me cry is that every week, Sunday night, extreme makeover, home edition. 
[01:12:00]  Stop it.  Why?  I love that show because they usually build those palaces in the middle of the ghetto.  Yeah, the horrible neighborhoods.  And then the cameras and the crews leave and these people have to fend for themselves  within the neighborhood.  I think it's the greatest show ever.  That's when they really should start rolling hidden cameras.  Yeah.  Because they saw what they did.  Night vision.  They know they got the flat screens in there and the great stereo systems and the nice  water beds and what have you. 
[01:12:30]  And then they go home like, well, our job is done here.  Bye-bye.  And you look around the neighborhood.  They do these makeovers and you're like, oh, boy.  The locals are going to just have a field day with this house.  Oh, we got a bunch of stuff worth a lot of money in here.  The first time that family leaves to go to grandma's house for a little baked apple pie,  their house is going to be taken apart like, I don't know, cockroaches.  Uh, no, like, uh, what?  No, uh, what's the?  Ant's taking apart a cricket. 
[01:13:00]  Thank you, Ant.  That's right.  That's right.  Here's another one that we love.  Wrestling fan crying.  Oh, this guy could be the most killable person I've ever heard.  What was the setup for this?  There's a guy and he's at.  It's, you know, it's, uh, they brought a few wrestlers to a high school gym, I believe.  Was that it?  E-Rock would know because this is, in fact, E-Rock.  E-Rock?  This, uh, this old guy starts crying about a wrestler announcing he's retiring. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Thanks for answering my question.  How old is this guy?  In a high school gym.  I'm so glad that, uh, you were listening.  E-Rock, the boss wants an answer.  Isn't it just in a high school gym somewhere?  Yeah, it's right here.  Holy crap.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to start crying at how stupid E-Rock is.  I hope he wants to know if it was, did this take place in a high school gym?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, now, yes.  Yes, Jimmy.  But I was always saying the boss wanted to know. 
[01:14:00]  He knew that right away, by the way, but he didn't know that I asked that question.  What was the, that's the big problem?  What was the, yeah, it's right here.  Yeah, answering, it was in a gym and then right here, it's the visuals right in front of him  so he can see.  Oh, so it's right here and then you transfer it over to the...  He's not showing you.  E-Rock, do yourself a favor.  Listen to the replay of the show today so you can hear how stupid you really were and  that you weren't listening whatsoever.  I can't see that.  He's trying to defend himself.  And Sam's looking.  Sam's ducking behind equipment laughing because he relishes. 
[01:14:30]  He's crying with joy.  All right, here's, uh...  What a scumbag.  Here's wrestling fan crying.  Or maybe not.  What is wrong with this disc?  I don't know, that one's always having trouble.  No, it was queued up.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, dammit!  I'll be...  Make it easy, man.  Thank you, guys.  You're awesome. 
[01:15:00]  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Why don't we have more audio of this guy?  Calm down, man.  Calm down, man.  He is the biggest fool I've ever seen.  What an ass of fool.  That video is up on a website I'm really not happy with, YouTube.  Look at him.  And the YouTube video is a little longer.  Maybe we could get a longer version of that.  And you can see him.  He's a fat ass.  Real to me! 
[01:15:30]  With those bad glasses.  He is exactly what you think he looks like.  He's just a dolt.  Yeah.  All right.  This is leading up to our latest crying clip.  Everyone's going to be talking about this today.  It's the former president just bawling about his son, Jeb.  He's an older man now.  George Bush, Sr., talking about Jeb Bush.  Yeah.  Governor of Florida.  But first, Jared.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, fairies, move it along.  I've been praying for a commercial for 10 minutes.  Well, we are a bunch of queers. 
[01:16:00]  Then you get one.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to your radio, the worst of Opian Anthony.  Jackie, what's going on?  I am never, ever, ever having sex again because of your show.  Yeah, what happened to me?  What happened?  Like this fetish thing?  Yeah.  You don't know what we're going to throw at you.  What about the fetish with the knives?  You like knives?  Get out of here.  That was my best friend.  Anyway.  Hold on, Jackie.  All right.  Now we've got to explore.  You're a little sick world.  Okay, fine.  You're into knives? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I'm kind of.  Thanks, bagel knives.  Get out of here.  Bagel knives going up and down her.  What?  You like knives being dragged across you or something?  Not like blood or anything.  No, but just a thought that something might happen?  No, it just feels good.  She's eating butter.  It feels good.  But I mean...  I'm going to kill you, Rob.  Wait.  Get Rob on the phone.  All right.  Hold on.  I hate you.  Yeah.  She likes knives?  Yeah.  Are you her boyfriend? 
[01:17:00]  No, I'm her roommate.  And what's the deal with her?  She's probably told you.  Actually, I found out by playing around one day.  I pulled out a knife and I just like grazed it against her.  She was like...  So, obviously, I kept going with it and just squirmed all over the place and was leaving  slug trails and stuff.  All right.  Get her back in the phone.  All right.  They want you back.  Nicole had the same fetish.  I swear. 
[01:17:30]  Nicole had that same fetish and I would drag the knives across her neck and she loved it.  And we listen to your show all the time.  I love it.  Let's put it in a Chewbacca defense.  Jackie.  Yeah.  If the knives are sharp, is it really a turn on?  Yeah.  Have you had sex with a guy just using the knives and stuff?  Yeah.  Holy...  I've been wanting to come on your guys' show for like ever and ever and ever.  And how excited do you get when they're dragging the knives across your body?  Extremely.  Rock.  Why do you get so turned on? 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  It's just one of those things.  So if we brought you down in the studio and we dragged knives all over your body, would  you have...  It's possible.  I don't...  I can't promise, but it's definitely possible.  But you would kind of get turned on at the end.  Absolutely.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  Book it.  Listen.  Get your boyfriend to get a knife.  He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, your roommate.  Can I go down and be a guest for the knife dragon?  I like the concept.  All right.  Jackie.  Get naked. 
[01:18:30]  He's got the knife.  He's got the knife?  Oh, my God.  What's...  Wait, wait.  Wait.  She's really getting into it.  Jackie.  Get the F out of here.  Get out of here.  You like this?  Yes.  What is he doing?  Say.  What is he doing?  Say.  What is he doing?  He's dragging the knife.  Oh, my God.  She can't be for real. 
[01:19:00]  Come on.  No, I'm dead serious.  She sounds like she's not faking.  She's still going, and she's like five feet from the phone right now.  I don't want to hear you.  Yeah.  No offense to you.  You sound like a cool guy.  Get Jackie back on the phone.  Hello?  Jackie.  Knife away from me.  They're trying to talk to me.  No, no.  Let him do this.  Take one for the...  Are you topless or anything?  Holy.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:30]  She's got to...  We've got to book her.  Where's he putting the knife?  Oh, my God.  On your stomach?  Holy.  I'm going to kick you.  I have platform boots on.  No, don't kick him.  The knife might...  Wow, this could be a radio first.  A lot of stabbing.  Are you naked?  No.  All right, get naked.  Take your clothes off.  No.  Come on, please.  At least go topless.  Fine.  All right.  Let him drag your knife across your...  People are in their cars losing it, Jackie. 
[01:20:00]  Just get your shirt off.  Listen up.  It's off.  It's off?  Yes.  All right.  What kind of boobs do you have?  What is he doing?  Is this a scene from 8mm?  She's not faking it.  Stop.  Stop. 
[01:20:30]  Stop.  Please.  Please.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  What was he doing with the knife?  He's dragging it all across my chest and stomach.  How sharp is the knife?  It's a bagel knife.  A bagel knife?  Mm-hmm.  What is that?  Like a sharp knife?  It's like a bread knife.  Sharp.  Very sharp bread knife.  Long and serrated.  Yeah, right.  It's a serrated bread.  I've seen those.  Okay.  They use them at the bagel store.  Yeah.  And it's very long.  Jackie, that is like the coolest thing I've ever heard, I think. 
[01:21:00]  Does he scrape you a little with the...  He drags it across.  Not too sharp.  Not the cut.  But just sharp.  Like...  Like on the sharp side.  He drags it, what?  Just barely?  Yeah, just enough.  Where did this start?  He was just fooling around one day and he dragged it across my stomach because it was  summer and I had a half shirt on.  And it just...  Wow.  And you had no idea that this was a turn-on until that happened that day?  Hey, let him drag it like just around your very intimate area. 
[01:21:30]  See?  Everyone was pissed off at us 15 minutes ago.  Look, we come back strong for you guys.  Yeah.  Okay, let's listen.  Oh my God.  You...  Go away.  No.  No, don't.  Don't send him away.  All right.  All right, we need the grand finale now.  Where's Rob?  Get Rob on the phone.  Okay, hold on. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Rob.  Rob.  Whatever.  You got to listen to me very closely.  All right.  Plunge it into her chest.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, Anthony.  I thought that you were going for it.  I ain't OJ.  No, Rob, listen to me.  And you got to trust me.  You have people freaked out all over the tri-state area right now, okay?  You got to really work it now, all right?  All right?  All right.  She's going to say stop, but you keep going.  All right.  Just don't hurt her.  I have to go on record and say don't hurt her, okay?  No, that's not a problem.  All right.  Get Jackie on the phone. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  All right.  And as soon as we start talking to her, you just go off with the knife, all right?  All right.  Hi, Jackie.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi. 
[01:23:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I hate you. 
[01:23:30]  I hate you.  Holy ass.  That makes up for laughing Walter.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Wow, that's pretty good.  That was insane.  Oh, my God.  Hey, could you come in here?  Yes.  All right, you've got to come in here. 
[01:24:00]  We're going to use really sharp knives if you come into the studio, though.  Okay.  Really sharp.  You're going to be on the show tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yes.  Okay.  We can't wait.  You hold on.  I will hold on.  Someone will pick you up immediately.  Right.  And we'll get some information from you, and we'll have you come down here and do this live.  All right?  Okay.  All right, cool.  Hold on.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  She hung up.  I'm kidding.  I just want to see your face.  Oh, you just put everyone in a panic. 
[01:24:30]  That was good.  I was off air.  I saw everybody go, oh, oh.  That's something.  Did you hear that?  She wasn't faking that.  You could completely tell.  Wow.  A knife.  At first, I'm like, all right, there's some gag going on here, but that was as real as it gets.  Rubbing a knife.  She was topless.  Nice body.  Wow.  The guy was rubbing a knife all over her body, and it drives her nuts.  Can you believe that fetish?  And she'll be in studio tomorrow. 
[01:25:00]  To-ma-ro.  God, that's kind of a dangerous fetish to have, because if somebody holds you at knife point,  you're just, oh, doing that sound.  That should get her sex toys from Ginsu.  The Ginsu.  The Ginsu.  Right.  Damn.  That rocked.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  Well, we'll have her down here and drag a knife across her.  We've got to get some nice knives.  We have to get, like, really good cutlery set.  Yeah.  Someone go out and get a good cutlery set. 
[01:25:30]  How does she feel about meat cleavers?  Oh.  That could hack right through a bone.  We have to get, like, you and I have to do another guy.  We have to go three or four guys just working the body with knives and see what happens.  All right?  Yeah.  Anthony, let's regroup.  Imagine a machete or a sword from, like, the Renaissance Fair.  She'd be off.  Impale her.  Nice.  Hey, this is Michael Shiklis.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Should we get Knife Girl in here, Ant, to say hi instead? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, let's have her say hi and see what the deal is with her.  We just talked to her on the phone yesterday.  Big Kev.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do have a stripper body.  Look at you.  Get over here.  Wow, look at that.  There we go.  Knife Girl.  Jackie, the Knife Girl.  Hello.  How you doing?  Good.  You're the girl that was getting turned on by that knife yesterday, huh?  Wow, look at you.  Your clothes are barely on you.  Yeah.  She's got a little tat going on.  What's that all about?  It's the Egyptian Eye of Horus.  Yes.  Wait, get her.  I noticed that it was Egyptian. 
[01:26:30]  Get her some.  I've seen it in movies.  Some headphones.  So everyone's talking about you today, Jackie.  Yeah.  I don't understand why.  Why?  What do you mean?  I don't get it.  You totally.  It's so exciting.  You turned people on so much yesterday.  I think, I don't think anyone has turned on people like you did yesterday.  And we've had some freaky stuff on this show.  Very flattered.  Are you?  Yes.  How old are you again?  22.  22.  22.  Very tall, Anthony.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'7", but I have these on.  Wow.  Well, look at those.  Those are those big. 
[01:27:00]  The Gene Simmons shoes, man.  I was actually kind of afraid that I wouldn't be able to get in.  I thought there was going to be like a metal detector at the front door.  What are you kidding?  Did you bring your knife?  This place?  Yes.  He told me to bring a knife.  Hey, Kev, give me those knives.  Oh, yeah?  You got a knife?  No, don't let her see.  Let's see your knife.  Let's see your knife.  Kidding.  It's in here.  Ow.  I don't like the knives.  Whoa.  Wow.  Let me see.  This is the bagel knife.  That's a bagel knife.  That's a bagel knife.  Holy smoke, is that sharp? 
[01:27:30]  That was the knife the guy was using yesterday.  And does he drag it on you like this?  Mm-hmm.  Like the way it would cut on the blade?  How does that not cut you?  The weight of the knife alone.  No.  And just talking about it, she's getting all turned on.  Look at you.  Yeah?  Look at her.  She's squirming, Anthony.  Does he go like this?  Like gently?  Look at her.  She's getting turned on with just you doing that.  Oh, yay!  Yay!  All right, look.  I'm just doing it on a piece of paper on the console.  We've got a couple more tricks for you today. 
[01:28:00]  What do you think of this?  Now, you're going to have to trust us because we sound like psychopaths on the radio, but  we're really just psychopaths.  I brought Rob with me.  All right, ready?  Wow.  It's a very large knife.  Is that a good one?  That's the classic Rambo knife.  Yeah.  Good one!  No, the Rambo knife.  Yeah, and why don't you try it out on the piece of paper and see?  Let me see.  Let's see.  Look at her.  Wow.  That's weighted knife.  How sharp is that, though?  It's sharp.  Pretty sharp.  It's very sharp.  Okay.  All right.  And like just gently, is it like a gently dragging thing over you so as not to cut? 
[01:28:30]  Wow, look at her.  Yeah.  You're going to be all right?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  Could you imagine this just on your skin?  Look how sharp that blade is.  Wow, she's washing and everything.  Are you having fun so far?  Absolutely.  I love the show.  You love the show?  Absolutely.  And work that knife again on the paper.  Oh, yeah, like this.  Look at her.  She's got her little bagel knife, and what they do is just slowly drag it across your belly.  And your breasts and stuff? 
[01:29:00]  Yes, anywhere.  Like that?  Wow.  Why can't you look at it?  She likes that thing.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  What's going on?  Nothing.  Just seeing that.  It's just, it's funny.  I just think it's funny that people just get, really like my fetish.  All right, yeah.  I'm going to show you something else.  Okay.  All right.  Pull those out.  See what she thinks of this.  It's a Freddy glove.  It's a Freddy glove.  What do you think of this?  They're real knife blades.  They're really, and you're closer to her. 
[01:29:30]  Check this out.  Check out the Freddy Krueger glove.  What do you think?  We made this for Halloween.  Yeah.  Isn't that pretty cool?  It's neat.  I like it.  Yeah.  Can we use it on your body, or what?  If you feel the need.  Really?  Feel the need.  She's looking at us like we're loonies.  Like we're loonies.  That's great.  And work it on the paper.  See if there's any reaction going on.  What?  Would you like this?  Like that?  Across, yeah.  It's weird looking.  It's not very sharp, either.  You need sharp?  Yes.  Like sharp is really hot for you?  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:00]  The sharper the better, right?  Absolutely.  So that Rambo knife's going to drive you nuts.  Probably.  Yeah.  That's pretty sharp.  Wow, this is wild.  All right.  Can we start with the Freddy Krueger glove as a warm-up, maybe?  Sure.  And then we'll do your bagel knife that's real sharp.  She likes the bagel knife.  And then we'll go to the Rambo knife?  Right.  We've got to make sure we're careful with the Rambo knife.  Oh, yeah.  Rob's outside.  Oh, yeah.  My roommate.  That's the guy that was doing it.  Yeah.  All right.  Get Rob in here for a minute.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Hey. 
[01:30:30]  So you guys aren't banging at all?  No.  I thought for sure.  Not at all.  I thought for sure you guys would do it after yesterday's little phone call.  No.  That incident has happened before.  Yeah.  Like I told you the first time, it was like a total accident.  And I was just like being goofy and ran it across her and went wild.  So obviously I kept, you know, milking it out of her.  Yeah.  Everyone is talking about you guys today.  Yeah.  Everybody.  We've done a lot of crazy stuff on this show.  But, I mean, the reaction that we got after you guys called in yesterday, unbelievable. 
[01:31:00]  Never seen anything like it.  Did you see the knives we have for her today?  Oh, no.  I have.  I saw the Freddy glove, though.  And the Rambo knife.  Show them the Rambo knife.  Yeah.  This one's pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  You think she's going to like that one?  Yeah, probably.  Unless she might just be into household cutlery.  Yeah.  You know?  Like, I thought the whole thing would, you know, get a wow out of you guys.  But I didn't think you guys would be this crazy.  Oh, we'd want to see it.  Just from her reaction.  The noises she really was making sounds. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, the noises she was making yesterday were just unbelievable.  Because, like, she had no idea.  I had it all in my head.  As soon as she called, I was like, I'm going to blow this up for it.  Yeah, I just wanted to talk.  Right.  All right, I figured you guys would dig it, so.  Well, can we get you, like, naked and do this next, or what?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure, why not?  All right.  I'm here.  All right, Jackie the Knife Girl in studio.  And, oh, look who's back.  Steve, that's Jackie the Knife Girl.  Hi, Jackie. 
[01:32:00]  Hello.  Anthony, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Love your show.  Now, listen, I think this woman would absolutely lose it if you blindfold her.  Does that work?  It really doesn't make a difference to me.  No.  No, I don't think it makes a difference.  Really?  I don't think so, either.  She was getting turned on just looking at the knives.  That is.  Really?  Yeah.  Look at her.  Just saying the word knife.  I'm surprised you guys didn't think of a machete.  Well, you should see this Rambo knife.  Yeah, like a Rambo knife.  Yeah, the Rambo knife is really big.  It's very large and very sharp.  Yes.  Okay.  I guess I'll do it. 
[01:32:30]  I'll talk to you later, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Got a saw on the back of this thing.  I know.  Jesus.  You like that sound?  Where did this fetish start?  Do you know?  No.  All right.  I have no idea.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  And Jackie the Knife Girl is next.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the O&A Show.  Hey.  Finally, we get to Jackie the Knife Girl.  Finally, it's been long enough. 
[01:33:00]  Let's go.  We got Drew Boogie in the studio, our new friend.  Yeah.  Jamaican Mike is here.  Big Kev is here.  Jamaican Mike.  A hot wax Shannon is here.  She's got a little present for us.  She's going to bring it in a little while.  But why don't we get to Jackie the Knife Girl, Anthony?  Yes.  Do you want to, like, set this up really fast?  I think everyone knows what we're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Called up yesterday.  We found out she has a knife fetish on the phone.  And a roommate over here was dragging knives across of her. 
[01:33:30]  And she was squealing with delight in such a way that I think every radio was tuned in.  And the guys were having problems driving.  I'm sorry.  The guys really liked that.  Oh, no.  Never be sorry about that.  They don't want to crash cars.  No, no.  What's the whole goal of that?  Yeah.  That is always the goal.  It worked.  Of this show.  To get people to crash.  Car accidents.  She was cordially invited to come in today and have various knives dragged across her  to see what this is like live.  Yes.  You know?  All right.  Why don't we get into this, Anthony?  Yes.  Why don't we?  All right. 
[01:34:00]  We've got to move the mics around and stuff.  All right.  We've got a mic.  We've got the lesbian couch.  I hope you don't mind.  It's okay.  We can lay down plastic if you like.  I mean, it's a little gnarly, the couch these days.  I really don't care.  You don't care.  Okay.  Now, who do you want to do the knife thing?  You want Rob to do it?  I trust him.  You trust Rob?  Let Rob do it, man.  He's afraid everybody else is going to stab me.  Oh, Jackie, get on the couch.  Okay.  It's really cold in here.  This glove is like tetanus ridden.  All right.  Rob's got the...  Wow.  Rob's got the Rambo knife that Scott brought in earlier. 
[01:34:30]  And his...  You got the other knife, too?  The bagel knife?  Give me that mic.  I've got to move on.  Don't confuse bagel knife with little butter knife.  Bagel knife is big, long, serrated knife you use to cut the bagels in the bagel stores.  You ever see those guys?  Yielding them around.  Hey, my mic just off.  That's great.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm just talking to myself.  No problem.  Mic just shuts off.  All right.  I need a mic so I can get over there.  We're moving some mics around so we can play along.  Jackie, you can get more comfortable if you like. 
[01:35:00]  Whatever you want to do.  I don't want to force you into doing anything you don't want to do.  It looks like you have some nice panties on under those leather pants.  I had to take my shoes off for that.  All right.  She's got to take her shoes off to take her pants off.  Oh, of course.  Oh, wait.  That worked?  Focus.  Yeah, it's better than we have our knife.  All right.  I hope you can plug in over there.  No, this is good.  I got a good view.  Anthony?  Very good.  Jackie's getting naked, Anthony.  Let me move over to the other mic, Opie.  Is that mic working right here?  All right.  Cool.  God, other shows just set up all this stuff while the commercials play, but we don't care. 
[01:35:30]  It's Jackie the Knife Girl.  She gets turned on by having knives rubbed all over her body.  Wonderful.  Her roommate, who she's not having sex with, Rob, is going to do the deal.  As a matter of fact, hi, Rachel.  Ah.  So there's a guy named Rachel involved here.  That's what I'm figuring out.  It's his fiance.  I'm teasing, of course.  All right.  So Rob wants to make it perfectly clear that he is not having sex with Jackie the Knife Girl.  You know, this moment looks very dangerous. 
[01:36:00]  Look at this.  This looks like the beginning of a snuff film.  Yeah.  It really does.  Rob, can we trust you?  Because that's a Rambo knife.  We're not playing with bagel knives anymore.  Well, actually, the bagel knife is far better than the Rambo knife anyway.  All right.  Rob, you know what?  For the photo op, I think it would be best if you were behind the couch.  Ooh.  We had a lot of requests to be completely silent for this.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Huh.  Huh. 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  Ah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:00]  He's picking up the Rambo knife.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I usually bring you the sounds of a girl being stroked with a knife.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, he just plunged the knife into the couch.  That was scary. 
[01:42:00]  He cuts the knife down at panties.  You could fillet her up real nice.  Get a tender as it down you go. 
[01:42:30]  I'm going to stand here and watch him cut that thing open and have that little kitten or boy spill out all over the floor.  Sorry.  This isn't a place for comedy.  Shut up.  Round zero. 
[01:43:00]  This is a turn on.  Go for a throw.  Oh, you wrecked it.  Hey, I ruined it.  You ruined it.  I ruined it.  What a way to end, though.  Bravo.  Let me be the first to say the most erotic thing I've ever seen in my life right there. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  That was something.  My God.  You've got to be kidding me.  I've got to try that.  Rob.  Rob and Jackie.  Holy ass.  But you didn't have to have OJ come in.  I can't possibly compare to OJ.  No, no, no, no.  My knife session didn't last that long.  Wait, Ann.  I was in and out.  You've got to come back here for a second.  Yeah.  Look at her body.  Oh, wow.  I saw.  I was right there.  There are knife scratches all over her body.  She's all pink.  No, it's not just. 
[01:44:00]  No, Ann.  It's not like she's pink.  It's like a cat.  You know when you get clawed by a cat?  It's all over her belly, all over her legs.  That's what I was saying when I saw her laying there.  They're like just fine scratches all over her body.  Bravo.  How was that, Jackie?  Very nice.  Very nice.  Wasn't that the rubbing apple?  Oh, God.  I don't know what else to say.  That was just amazing.  Anthony, what are you thinking?  That was nice.  But where's the guy that brings her sunglasses? 
[01:44:30]  Wow.  Hey, Irene did.  Well, you can put your clothes in there.  Anthony.  What?  Anthony, you dick.  You dick.  You dick.  Hey, Irene.  I was ready to say you're the best, Anthony.  I love you, but you dick.  What'd you do?  It was a perfect ending.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was very nice.  Oh, you guys are the best.  All right.  That's right.  What is it?  All right.  All right.  We might have an encore before we get out of here, okay? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if her body can handle it, though.  There's, like, scratches everywhere.  You ought to stick that in, boy.  That's something.  I'm speechless.  That was just, yeah, we got to take a break, and then we'll go to the phones, because people  are just losing their minds right now.  Yeah.  Hey, do you ever see the movie Seven?  Yes.  Yeah.  What about that contraption that guy was wearing for lust?  Oh, yeah.  That was some pretty cool stuff.  You like that?  Yeah.  The big knife on the strap-on thing, and you just rip the girl in two? 
[01:45:30]  I wouldn't like dying.  No?  No.  I prefer to stay alive.  You think you're not going to like the finale of this show?  All right.  Wow.  We got to go to the phone and see what people are saying right now.  Yeah.  Bobby, what's going on?  Anthony.  Yeah.  You effing tool, dude.  You ruined a good time.  I'm getting crap now from everybody.  You suck, man.  Why'd you have to ruin it?  If she was going, she could have won another five minutes.  Yeah, you mean it.  I could have won another ten.  See, for once, I didn't ruin it. 
[01:46:00]  Opie, you didn't ruin nothing, man.  At least you shut your mouth on this one.  But, Anthony, you're an idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I'll agree with you on this one.  Yeah, you're a f***er.  All right.  It was a great ending, though.  Come on.  Yeah.  Corey, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  That was incredible.  I just wanted to say, I never thought I'd live to see the day when Edward Scissorhands could  star on Porno.  Yeah, it was like Edward Scissorhands, the Porno.  Without a doubt. 
[01:46:30]  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you, Corey.  All right, let's see what John has.  John, you're next on NEW.  Oh, you guys rule.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Yeah.  I just wanted to tell you, I've looked for a woman like that.  I have the same exact fetish.  I found out the same way.  Oh, yeah?  I didn't find out until a woman actually put a knife into my, you know, pointed it into  my chest, playing around, and I realized it turned me on.  It's incredible.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you.  Ah, yeah.  This seems so much hotter when a girl's talking about the fetish.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Adam.  Adam, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, I wanted to congratulate you guys on the best silent game you ever played.  Yeah, there was no reason to talk there.  I was just hoping you guys heard the knife scraping on her belly.  Absolutely.  Because I wasn't sure if we could only hear it in the studio or if you heard that out  there in Radioland.  Oh, I heard it.  Okay, good.  All right, Adam.  Have a good night.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Ernio.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Dude, I want to tell you guys, but you guys do some of your best work when you're not talking.  Did you hear that?  We didn't say a word. 
[01:47:30]  And then I reamed it.  You reamed it.  Hey, shut up, you reamed.  All right, Ernio.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Great.  Yeah, hey, we'll step aside.  We obviously were not the stars of today's show, that's for sure.  We were observers.  Hey, a lot of people asking for an encore, maybe to finish up the show.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  That's cool.  Quick curtain call.  Have a little left in here or what?  Absolutely.  No problem.  I suggest gloves and a black hat. 
[01:48:00]  Should I move to the couch?  And then give everything to Robert Kardashian.  And then take a plane to Chicago.  F and OJ, man.  I think Jackie the Knife Girl and Rob are ready.  And Hot Wax Shannon Topless.  We'll go out with this.  This was the whole show.  Everything else we did was a waste of time today.  Nice.  Wow, now she's got two knives working her body, Anthony. 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  We leave you with this.  Rick, move.  Oh, now she's got two knives. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, now she's got two knives. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, now she's got two knives.  I don't know. 
[01:50:00]  Dylan! 
[01:50:30]  Ah!  You're an ass.  Everyone's mesmerized.  Dick.  Everyone jumped.  What the hell?  Did we change roles today?  Okay.  You're such a deke. 
[01:51:00]  It wasn't me.  You can't do anything.  You ruined it.  Oh, no.  You ruined it.  You guys, let's hear it for Jackie the Night Girl.  Star of the show.  Star of the year.  I love it.  The people probably have their radios turned up real loud in the cars so they can hear it. 
[01:51:30]  Good.  I would bet money that someone got in a fender bender overnight.  And that's how it ends today, guys.  Thank you very much for listening.  This is crap.  Always a pleasure to be here.  Hey, this is Geraldo Rivera, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, Blue Angels.  We were supposed to talk about that before getting into other things.  Yep.  It's Fleet Week.  Fleet Week.  Bunch of the ships coming in. 
[01:52:00]  Guys, keep your women indoors.  Bunch of sailors roaming around town looking for sacks, looking to have a good time in  New York City.  But the Blue Angels did a flyover yesterday.  How can you say the Blue Angels stink?  I'll tell you what, because I was here for September 11th, and when you're in the morning  and all of a sudden you hear planes like 10 feet over your building, you get a little  nervous.  Yeah, you look, you see there are boys, you salute them, and go, Godspeed.  No, you look, and you see a formation of military jets, and you crap your pants. 
[01:52:30]  See, you're one of these people I was just going to address, because I saw, driving back  to the garage, and I saw the Blue Angels between, you know, the buildings, so they go  by, like, incredibly fast, of course.  How do they go by?  How does it go?  You play way too many video games.  He really does.  He's now living a video game.  Maverick, stay above the hard deck. 
[01:53:00]  Punch out, Maverick, punch out.  You're in a flat spin.  Poor Goose cracks his head, stupid Goose.  How great was that?  I love doing Goose cracked his head on the canopy.  Stupid head.  And then stupid, what's her name, crying.  Where the hell played Goose's wife?  Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan.  I was going to say Mel Gibson.  The Blue Angels, by the way, spelled B-L-E-W.  No, please. 
[01:53:30]  That's the gayest movie.  You want, when it first came out, I saw it in the theater with a bunch of my friends,  and we were just sitting there going, right from the opening carrier sequence.  You guys were high-fiving?  High-fiving each other.  Holding each other's hands.  Holding each other's hands down the aisle to get to our seats.  Because we couldn't see in the dark.  Maybe we'd help each other out.  It was such a cool movie.  When you saw it.  I'm not talking about holding hands.  A bunch of men fishing into each other's pockets for goobers.  And then you watch it years later and go, 
[01:54:00]  Is this a bunch of just homoerotic drivel?  They're all in the locker room with towels on.  I'll tell you who's the best.  I'm the best.  Val Kilmer snaps his teeth.  Right.  Snaps his teeth at Maverick.  You're unsafe.  Am I?  You should wear rubber.  Am I?  Should I?  That's exactly what he meant.  You should wear condoms.  Am I unsafe?  Take a look at this. 
[01:54:30]  Zip.  It doesn't even have to.  He's wearing a towel.  Just undo the towel.  And just let it drop.  Wow, Maverick.  You are flying above the hard deck.  You may be a better flyer than me, but take a look at my hog.  Take a look at this.  You could be my wingman anytime.  Take a look at this Sidewinder missile.  Pally.  Douchey 80s dialogue.  Oh, it was horrid.  Maverick.  Maverick and Goose.  So, yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Enough.  The Blue Angels in town.  And they got the police.  911 was being tied up.  They're getting all kinds of calls from people going, there's planes over New York.  If you had any inkling of what's going on in the city, you would realize that it's fleet week.  They're doing air shows.  They're military aircraft around.  And it's military aircraft.  It's fleet.  You said fleet.  Fleet.  People think boats. 
[01:55:30]  If I saw a huge aircraft carrier coming in, I wouldn't be disturbed.  They're the fleet week.  There are things called naval aviators.  Yeah, but who does that at 8 in the morning?  Do it at 12 in the afternoon.  It was in the afternoon.  No.  When I saw it, it was wonderful.  By the way, I got to cut in.  Scaredy cat.  The instant feedback is rocking today.  Liddy rules.  All right.  It took you years to figure out Top Gun was gay, even with that volleyball scene?  Look, all right.  Even when I first saw it, that volleyball scene is probably the gayest thing. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  That's hardcore gay porno.  What was that?  I don't remember that.  Oh, when they had the volleyball game and all took their shirts off and posed.  They're doing these muscle man poses.  I'll tell you what made it gay.  This is what made it gay.  Not that they had their shirts off.  It's that they weren't in shorts.  They were in jeans.  Yeah.  They had their jeans with no tops.  It was like a gay neck belt.  And it was filmed with a high-speed camera, so it's in slow motion.  Whole motion.  It was the gayest part of any movie, even gay porno. 
[01:56:30]  Whole motion.  Whole motion.  They filmed it in.  Yeah, set me up for the spike.  Okay, lay down.  And then another one, Flying Standby writes,  did Opie turn to Danny at the Mets game and say,  you're dangerous, and snap his teeth.  Snap his teeth.  When he snaps his teeth, you're like, what the hell is that?  That was the weirdest thing ever.  What is he snapping at? 
[01:57:00]  Hey, let's go to Stu in New Hampshire.  No teeth in the locker room?  Norton trying to do it.  I want to snap my teeth in people.  Hey.  Oh, the phones are working now.  Good.  Stu.  I want to call Opie out for his dumb line a minute ago.  Yeah, which one?  He said to Maverick, I'm a better flyer than you are.  Does she mean pilot?  What's a flyer?  Well, come on.  That's a little picky.  Technically, he was a flyer.  Something you stick underneath a windshield wiper in a parking lot?  Absolutely.  We have nothing written down.  We're just improvising all morning long. 
[01:57:30]  Give us some grace.  We're winging it, man.  Yeah, we're just kind of, uh, we're just winging it, man.  We're doing it on the pilot.  We're all trying not to say the F word.  Word.  Right.  How hard it is.  How hard.  A curse while you're talking about Top Gun.  Especially when you said, like, this gay topic, you want to say.  Oh, of course you do.  I'm looking at Norton's face, his bottom lip just quivering.  You think the volleyball scene, by the way, was Tom Cruise's idea?  I don't know.  If I recall, I don't believe Tom Cruise was topless in that one.  He was.  I think he, uh. 
[01:58:00]  He took his top off.  Goose was the only one that wasn't.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Yeah, he didn't want to, uh.  What was the problem with Goose?  Well, Goose was, what's his name from ER?  What was the problem?  Anthony Edwards.  Three nipples?  I'm thinking, way out of shape.  Looked at, uh, looked at the other hot gentleman and said, I'll pass.  I'm keeping the wife beater on at least.  But thank you to, uh, to a homo fan for remembering that Goose had, it was Goose that didn't have  his shirt off.  Tom had his shirt off.  I'm going to say birthmark the size of a baseball with lots of hair, like just off the side. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, you think that's it?  A big hairy one they couldn't cover with makeup?  Right.  A big German shepherd mole on his, underneath his armpit.  He couldn't, he couldn't actually go for the ball.  Everybody kept throwing up in their mouths at the test screenings.  Can we put a pink tank top on him, please?  Put your shirt back on.  Uh, Miguel.  What's up, Miguel?  Yeah, what about when, uh, in that volleyball scene, when Tom Cruise goes to check his watch, 
[01:59:00]  check the time, he like, does like a little, like a little muscle flex there.  It was the way, every move they made, no matter how innocent, he's absolutely right.  Tom Cruise goes to just check his watch because he's late with his date with Kelly McGillis.  So he checks his watch.  It's in slow motion.  And it's like he flexes his bicep, turns around.  He like has to turn at the waist and his other arm is kind of doing this, uh, uh, uh, curl. 
[01:59:30]  And he's looking at his watch.  I, I remember it like, like it was yesterday.  Yeah, like, like yesterday on the couch with your glasses on naked.  My night vision.  What year was that, like 88?  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Yeah, that's about right.  Maybe even before, I don't know.  Hey, uh, Jason from Ohio, how about the scene right before Goose dies when they're singing  Great Balls of Fire?  Yeah.  Oh, that was great.  That was when everyone realized Tom Cruise could not sing.  Or the other one where he's like, 
[02:00:00]  You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips.  And then just starting to criticize little things I do.  Shut up.  That movie was really awful.  It really was.  Hot Gun stinks.  I'm saying that like it's risky.  Yeah, I was saying.  You're really out on a limb there.  I'm a rebel.  I was like, thanks for heading to the, uh, bumping at hand, Jimmy.  Wow.  Raging Bull sucked. 
[02:00:30]  Now that's making a statement.  That's true.  Very profound.  I know.  All of a sudden I come in and just kill it.  I hate my gun.  That movie stunk.  You know, Biodome really didn't hit the mark.  Right.  I take no prisoners when I do radio.  You're edgy.  You're edgy.  Right.  I'm on the edge, man.  Let's take no prisoners.  Hey, who's this?  Guy on phone.  Don't have name.  What's your name?  Go.  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Let's go, Chris.  Right when Iceman turns to Maverick and chomps his teeth and says, you're unclipped, and 
[02:01:00]  I don't like that.  No, he's not.  I think that was in the, uh, outtake reel.  The gag reel for the Christmas party.  Why is everyone bringing it back to me at the Mets game?  Because you were holding hands with Danny.  And here's the beauty of it.  You didn't know it was Danny, so you had no shame.  There was no irony in it.  You were walking naturally, just holding his hand.  And they're probably like, that's open.  I'll have to explain to Bob Kelly now in a second.  Did Danny try to catch a foul ball without a glove, and you bit at him and said, you're 
[02:01:30]  dangerous?  How did you not know?  Well, Josie writes, did Opie go to Danny?  You can ride my tail anytime.  You share a little story on the show, and you can't move on.  Of course not.  Justin from Rockford, Illinois.  They will not stop.  Hey, Opie, were there any monster rain delays at the Mets game yesterday?  And it goes over here.  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia Beach.  We're not even talking about what happened at the Mets game anymore.  We're talking... 
[02:02:00]  Opie, did you break your knee at the Mets game?  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand, Danny.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, Dan.  Jesus.  Well, now I've got to tell Bob Kelly before the break.  I actually heard it.  Oh, you did.  I heard you...  All right.  They actually slipped the move in.  But how did you not know that your beautiful girl's soft hands didn't...  All of a sudden felt like the bottom of a slipper.  Grab Danny's hand.  You have no problem doing stuff like that.  I have no problem.  Danny, come here.  Come here, Danny.  Let Bob Kelly hold your hand.  Again. 
[02:02:30]  Tell me if I should have noticed.  If I should have noticed.  It's like Super Mario.  It's going to be like...  But the mind played tricks.  It's a bricklayer.  Put the coffee down.  If we're going to do this, we're going to do this right now.  But the mind plays tricks on you.  When you turn around...  Keep your pants on.  When you turn around and grab your girlfriend's hand, you're assuming you still have your girlfriend's  hand in your hand.  I feel like I'm holding rolled up quarters.  His hands are like fat and...  Oh, great.  Thanks, Bob.  Couldn't help me out one time.  It doesn't look like the thin fingers that are, you know, like ladylike. 
[02:03:00]  Your mind plays tricks.  When you turn around and go...  Your mind plays tricks.  When you turn around and you grab your girlfriend's hand, you see yourself grabbing her hand.  Now you turn forward.  She's behind you.  You're kind of dragging her along.  Then you reach behind and grab her other hand.  You're assuming you have her hand.  You would have a defense if you didn't know Danny was with you.  If all of a sudden he showed up and grabbed your hand.  And I'm really into it because we had a really nice day together.  So I'm walking up the aisle in front of everybody.  Because the seats were so far down. 
[02:03:30]  And then I walk all the way up the row assuming...  Because all of a sudden Lindsay let go.  And I'm assuming I'm still holding on to one of her hands.  As you say something, were you putting your energy into the...  That's what I asked.  A little squeeze or a thumb rub.  Were you putting love energy, like that orange light of energy, into like trying to...  Oh, can you feel that?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Because when you hold hands with your girl, sometimes you rub with your thumb or you play  with her pinky or something like that.  You're saying that I always had such a great time. 
[02:04:00]  And sometimes when that happens with your girl, you try to make her feel that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  The energy you touch with.  A little squeeze.  We'll do dumb things to each other all the time.  But when you know it's happening, you're like, ah, whatever.  I'll just deal with it, right?  But this, I really believed I had Lindsay's hand.  And I'm walking, you know, well, once again, I grabbed her hand.  I turned around.  Now I'm dragging.  She's behind me.  Who, George Lindsay?  See, we're going up a very narrow aisle at Shea Stadium from way down near the field  all the way up.  So everyone can see you walking up the aisle. 
[02:04:30]  And then I reached back to grab her other hand because now we're like single file, basically.  So I'm holding both her hands, really getting into it.  She has a great sense of humor, so she sees what's going on.  Sold you right out.  Well, no, because I never grabbed her second hand is what happened.  I definitely had one of her hands.  And when I reached back to grab her other hand, she's got a good sense of humor.  Where Danny grabs my other hand.  And she goes with it, realizes what's happening, and lets go.  So now I'm assuming I got Danny.  I got Lindsay.  That's where it comes out.  When I hold her high. 
[02:05:00]  I'm assuming I got Lindsay's hand as I walk all the way up the aisle and then across to  get to the exit.  And, yes, I'm really feeling like I was.  The whole way, just holding a man's hand in front of Shea Stadium.  Shea Stadium.  It wasn't like at a Broadway show or something.  Without an ounce of shame or discomfort about it.  Because I had no idea.  I had no idea.  Someone, wow, someone was there at Shea, saw it, and actually heard you say,  take me to bed or lose me forever. 
[02:05:30]  Take my breath away.  Take my T-cells away.  Take my dignity away.  Hold my hand, I'm gay.  All right, it's only fair.  I did this to Anthony yesterday.  I'll do it to myself today.  Yeah.  Because there's probably a part of you that, like, when you were walking up just feeling  good, they probably said, God, it's never felt this right. 
[02:06:00]  Because you're unsafe, Johnny Cakes.  No idea, man.  I was, like, laughing really hard and mortified at the same time when I finally turned.  So that was just Danny.  That was damn funny.  I'm like, please don't tell me I've been holding your hand pretty much the whole time.  He goes, yeah, you have.  I'm like, oh.  Danny, you know we're going to have to take you to a hotel room and beat you with a pool  cue.  Right.  Halfway through the fifth inning, you knew it felt kind of odd, but then you didn't even  look until the bottom of the seventh.  You looked at Danny.  It's a joke. 
[02:06:30]  It's a joke.  You know what it is.  You've got to have some kind of hair.  Do you have any hair on your hands?  Dude, you're not thinking.  No, dude.  He does.  And I'll tell you why his fingers, because I hope my, you know.  There's no hair on his knuckles.  Dude, his fingers feel like little, the little fat construction worker hands.  But you're not thinking, because you turned and you saw yourself grab, you know, your girlfriend's  hand.  Right.  Yeah, those are hands just made for, like, framing out a house.  Hold this hand.  I'm not even falling into this. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not touching his hand.  You just rubbed it.  Hold this hand.  Hold this.  It wasn't his hand.  Okay.  He's all limp.  You do have some pudgy fingers there.  He does.  He has pudgy fingers.  He could open up any can with those hands.  He was hoping to with the game.  All right.  Listen.  It's becoming a rough morning for me here.  Why don't we, uh, we have to take a break.  We are so late.  It's not even funny.  We got Drew Boogie in studio, uh, rocking and rolling for us, doing some mixing with some 
[02:07:30]  of the sounds of the O&A show.  And it's his birthday, so take us out for a little bit, Drew.  So, are you breathing?  So, are you breathing?  So, are you breathing?  So, are you breathing?  So, are you breathing?  So, are you breathing? 
[02:08:00]  So, are you breathing?  So, are you breathing?  No!  No!  Are you ready?  No!  No!  No!  Are you ready?  No!  No!  No! </pre>
