<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, referring to themselves and their crew with offensive terms like "rabid radio retards" and "dummies."  They immediately launch into a discussion of their high ratings in Philadelphia, celebrating a massive WYSP-provided food buffet as a testament to their success. This contrasts sharply with the perceived struggles of rival hosts Preston and Steve, whose inexplicable April ratings surge and subsequent May plummet are dissected with much speculation.  Anthony then vents about the havoc wreaked by three children visiting his home, referring to them as "bugs" and detailing minor damages, particularly to his new hardwood floors.

The show plays a viral recording of a listener's agonizingly long phone call with AOL customer service, leading to the employee's firing.  This prompts a discussion about frustrating customer service experiences.  They also promote upcoming Mantown promos and listener submissions.  Jimmy Norton reveals that Kate Beckinsale's assistant contacted him, setting the stage for a lengthy and crude discussion about how he should approach the situation, with studio guest Rich Voss contributing humorous (and often vulgar) advice.  The conversation meanders through tangents involving  rumors about Beckinsale’s alleged use of plastic tarps and various dating anecdotes.

A major segment focuses on the relentlessly mocked "Mantown" promotional campaign from a Worcester radio station, using homophobic slurs in their ridicule of the campaign’s implied homosexuality and Greg Hill, the station’s personality.  Numerous listener-submitted Mantown promos are played for comedic effect. The hosts boast about their own superior ratings and promote their upcoming comedy tour.  News items briefly discussed include a Bronx councilman’s fast-food restriction proposal and a media controversy surrounding an interview with Dr. Ian Smith.

Rich Voss, still in studio, discusses his use of expired nicotine patches and nicotine gum.  He mentions working on a Chris Rock movie, downplaying his role while engaging in humorous banter with Opie and Anthony about his acting career and self-importance, referencing past roles like "White Chicks" and a failed Lenny Bruce portrayal.  A call from Joey Vega is cut short due to technical difficulties. Further discussion centers on Voss's on-set behavior, including his constant complaining and repeated Lenny Bruce references, even recounting an actor walking off set after Voss's "Animal House" inquiry.  A listener email criticizing the show's homophobia is read and dismissed. Voss's upcoming gigs are promoted, along with a discussion about "cougars," spurred by Anthony's observation of the trend. Voss recounts a story about kissing an "albino hippie grandma" in South Beach.  The new movie "The Cougar Club" and the influence of "Sex and the City" are also discussed.

A comedic bit featuring baseball announcer impersonations follows. The show transitions to the XM portion, including an interview with porn star Ari Vox, who discusses her profession in explicit detail.  This is followed by a live, impromptu comedy set by Rich Voss at a New York City establishment, documented by his awkward performance and the audience’s largely unimpressed reactions.  The entire segment is rife with offensive language and sexually explicit content.

The show continues with more discussion about Voss's poorly received diner performance, including a caller accusing him of stealing jokes from Anthony.  This leads to a debate about joke ownership and Voss's comedic career.  A "dumb sheet" of Voss's on-air gaffes is also mentioned, specifically focusing on a joke about hemorrhoids.  Their experience on "Last Comic Standing" is discussed, alongside criticism of Voss's new DVD cover tagline "Get Rich Quick".  A significant portion details the Spanish dubbing of Jimmy Norton's lines from "Lucky Louie,"  with comparisons between the original and dubbed versions. The departure of a Reuters reporter is mentioned.  The segment ends with a celebratory discussion of unexpectedly high Boston ratings, contrasting their success with that of David Lee Roth, and news of Pete Townshend retiring his guitar-smashing act.  The segment is heavily punctuated with profanity and sexually explicit language.

The final segment focuses on the show's success, particularly in Philadelphia and on satellite radio.  They compare themselves favorably to Howard Stern, mocking Stern's supposed inability to adapt to FCC regulations and his perceived lavish lifestyle.  A caller from Philly confirms their high ratings, and the hosts discuss their success and Howard Stern’s supposed displeasure.  They discuss vacation plans, contrasting their short break with Stern's rumored month-long absence.  The challenges of adapting to different broadcasting platforms are discussed, along with a successful Atlantic City comedy show and the high ratings of Jim Norton's HBO show *Lucky Louie*.  A listener provides specific rating numbers.  The hosts discuss the nuances of performing comedy, with Jim Norton, a guest in studio, contributing comedic anecdotes about awkward encounters and his experiences on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*.  The show concludes with further discussion of their ratings, upcoming appearances, and mentions of photos of Patty in a porn star's jeans available online, plus upcoming Mantown merchandise and an interview with the Associated Press.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  O.P. and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news with perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show. 
[00:00:30]  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's a hair like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E.R.O.S.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:01:00]  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Inn.  Shut up!  You're both in.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  On the road.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:30]  I'm so full.  I am so full.  Stuff in my face at 5.30 in the morning.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, we're eating it, all right.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, we're eating it, all right.  Eating.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Eating.  Eating.  Eating.  Eating.  Eating.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  I don't think they brought any Johnny Cakes.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Did they bring Johnny Cakes?  I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[00:02:00]  I love Johnny Cakes.  Filling up that emptiness inside with lots and lots of food.  Lots and lots of carbs.  Open your mouth.  Can't pay in for it.  You eat it.  What is that private tile?  Sir, jelly donut, sir.  Mmm, delicious.  Open your mouth.  Can't pay in for it.  You eat it.  We're going to need a nap by 7 o'clock.  We're going to have nap time on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:02:30]  You can join in.  At your cubicle.  When you're at your cubicle.  Oh, my God.  I'm so full.  Morning, Mr. Baxter.  Can I have that Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay.  I pity the boy fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  You find all these eating clips.  Stan's helping.  Very good.  I don't have one over here, I don't think.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper. 
[00:03:00]  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Always funny.  A Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  We have food.  We have food, Tim.  We have food.  Oh, shit.  Do the long one. 
[00:03:30]  I want to sing a little song.  I can't hear this.  I can't hear this.  We are the world.  We are the children.  Oh, is that horrible. 
[00:04:00]  Anyway, it's the Opie and Anthony show and we got a massive buffet under the large flat  screen TV.  Courtesy of?  WYSP in Philadelphia.  Yes.  Now, why?  Karen Buck and the gang.  Thank you, Karen.  Why on earth would they send us a wonderful spread like that?  Well, the ratings came out yesterday for Philly.  Yes, they did.  And we are kicking some serious ass early on.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  So if you're listening to WYSP right now, thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you so much.  Bless you.  Make sure you tell your friends that we're back broadcasting in Philadelphia, courtesy  of WYSP.  Yeah, that looked good.  It looked really good when you really break it down.  Thank God we're doing well, Opie, because, oh, we were brought in as the saviors.  Imagine when you're brought in as the saviors and you stink.  You don't do it.  Oh, I am the saviors.  I will place my hands upon you and heal you. 
[00:05:00]  I still really hurt over here, but I've healed you.  I am the saviors.  No, you're really not.  No.  By the way, Preston and Steve in deep trouble.  Yeah, this looks like it's going to be a very easy battle, unfortunately.  On the outside.  We like a nice challenge, but they're not going to be the challenge.  On the outside, it looks impressive.  Right.  Preston and Steve.  Like, they have very big numbers. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  But then when you dig a little deeper and look at the monthly breakdowns, they had a month  where I don't know, were they giving away free women for the month of April?  Because their ratings were double what they normally are.  Like, they had normal, whatever it is, across the board every month, same thing, same, same,  same, same, same, April came 100% increase in their ratings for that one month of April. 
[00:06:00]  And then May comes along, and boom, right back down, business as usual.  So they have this huge month in there that's really bringing their average way up, and it  looks very impressive, which helps us out, because by the time it's just a full O&A book,  that April month for them will be out of there.  It will look like they plummeted, and we went up, and it will look like we took all  their listeners.  It's wonderful.  I would love to know what they did in April, though, because I want to do it if it doubles 
[00:06:30]  your ratings.  And why did they stop?  And why did you stop?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they drastically dropped in May.  Yeah.  Drastically dropped, but they still have one really good month and one good month.  It's averaged in there.  It's like if you were getting, you know, 75 on your test scores, and then all of a sudden  you get 100 in there, and it's averaged in with two of your 75s, it's going to look a  lot more impressive.  Well, tell me about it. 
[00:07:00]  We're dealing with that on the opposite end.  Yeah, exactly.  We got two horrific months from good old David Lee Roth.  We have David Lee Roth's special education class tests, and then we have our, you know,  trigonometry course test in there.  So we're on the move, and we're on the move big time in Philadelphia.  Thank you, WYSP, and thanks to everyone who's listening to us on WYSP.  Philly, always been friends of the show.  We love going there.  Can't wait to get there.  And they just came back, man. 
[00:07:30]  Came back treating us well and couldn't be happier with the fine folks and YSP in Philly.  You know, you guys are thanking everybody, but how about I thank you for being so entertaining?  And let me thank you, Kenny, for that thank you.  Well, I thank you for thanking me.  Okay.  Nice.  Nice.  So we got a huge buffet, Kersey, of WYSP and Karen Buck and the gang down there in Philly. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I think the pests need to call Preston and Steve and ask them if they're getting a little nervous.  Yeah.  Are they starting to shake in their boots?  Are they shaking in their boots yet?  Ask them what happens when...  Oh, we're coming to get you.  What happens when April drops out?  Oh, we're coming to get you.  Ooh.  Ooh.  They're going to do well for the book, unfortunately, because they still have that April thing.  They still have that April thing in there.  Let me tell you, even if you don't understand ratings, if you're showing sixes, and then 
[00:08:30]  all of a sudden that six jumps to a 14, that's what happened in one of the demographics.  It was like six, six, five, six, 14 out of nowhere.  And then back to the sixes.  It's like, wow, what wizardry were they using?  What wizardry?  Like, they were using Jedi mind tricks on their listeners.  You will fill out the diary for us. 
[00:09:00]  You will give us a 14 share.  What the hell they do?  And yeah, why'd they stop?  Is this their request number?  I can only do it once.  Hey, to the ONA pest, if you want to have a little fun today, WMMR in Philly, that's the  station we're going to knock off the top.  Yep.  No problem.  I guarantee we'll do it.  We're already on it.  I think we're going to do it faster than we even thought we would.  WMMR, Preston and Steve, ask them if they're shaking in their boots today.  Shaking in their boots?  When the ratings came out last month, we sent, what, a huge thing of flowers to congratulate 
[00:09:30]  those guys on their last really good book.  Yeah.  And we're coming, man.  And we're coming fast.  So for the pest, especially in the Philly area.  Sounds like a personal problem you need to work out.  How did I say that?  I've heard some herbal therapy might work.  That's right.  Think of dead animals.  Look what I just got away with on regular radio.  Or nothing.  215-263-WMMR for the ONA pest, especially in the Philly area. 
[00:10:00]  Messed around with them a little bit today.  Seems they're brave enough to even acknowledge that you're calling their radio show.  Have a little fun.  I bet you they don't go with it.  No one ever does.  Why would they?  We do, and then we get in trouble for it, for putting the competition's cohorts on the  microphone.  Yeah.  Well, it's 215-263-WMMR.  Have a little fun with them today, ONA pest.  Just slap them around a little bit. 
[00:10:30]  Just give them a little slap, slap, slap.  I've been reading the message boards, and they're looking for a good mission.  They're chomping at the bit, the pest.  They're saying, we haven't been on a mission in a while.  You know, they're sitting there at base camp, just hanging around, cleaning their weapons,  looking for a little bit of a battle.  Go ahead.  Have some fun with them.  Nothing big.  You don't have to lob any big artillery shells in there.  Just a little small arms fire to start with.  That's all we're looking for.  All right.  We're going to get very lazy today because the food is... 
[00:11:00]  The food won't stop.  I have not stopped shoving food in my mouth.  No, you haven't.  And the guy keeps coming up from downstairs with more and more food.  Bringing more stuff.  More food.  More food.  This is free.  So there you go.  That's the deal in Philly.  And I guess we get ratings for Boston today.  Boston coming in today.  It's after like 10 o'clock.  Yeah, it's still very, very early on in the game.  But we're looking forward to a little tick up in Boston as well today. 
[00:11:30]  We like little ticks up.  Unfortunately, like we said earlier, we've got to deal with the David Lee Roth average in there.  So two of the numbers are Dave's.  One is ours right now.  But still, it goes up because we did, you know, very well.  But it's going to be nice when all those David Lee Roth numbers are out of there.  My God.  My God.  Enough already.  All right.  Hey, we want an update on the guests at Anthony's house.  Well?  We all know that Anthony hates kids, hates people in general. 
[00:12:00]  Well...  You hate people in general.  Yeah, but family I don't really hate, but I'm just...  It doesn't matter who it is.  Just put it that way.  It doesn't matter who it is.  I like my privacy.  I like my privacy.  I like being able to do what I want, when I want, go where I want, and not really deal with anybody.  That's just the way I like to live.  You want to be able to march around the house whenever your little heart is up.  I've had to put all my uniforms away. 
[00:12:30]  There are three kids in the house now.  And you know me with children.  That's not good.  And with children, I don't care who they are.  One of them is my own godson.  And I am...  But they're children to me.  And it's...  Children to me are like bugs.  They're bugs in your house.  And unfortunately, you can't just step on them and throw them out the door.  So they're just running around all the time.  They do what kids do.  You know, I'm not telling anybody anything new. 
[00:13:00]  They're not doing anything different than what kids do.  But I hate what kids do.  I don't like it.  And then I'm glancing over.  And I know...  I know they're not doing anything that's damaging to the house.  But there's a little R2-D2 robot roaming around the house.  Which, by the way, is activated by...  Do I have my little...  Yeah.  It's activated when someone comes around it.  Now, I'm a very jumpy person. 
[00:13:30]  I'll tell you.  Oh, crap.  I'm very jumpy.  I'm like, very aware all the time of everything going on around me.  When I walk down the stairs in the morning in my house...  Wait a minute.  How aware can you be if you're talking to Jimmy's butt and answering Jimmy's butt?  I heard something say...  That's not being aware.  It is being aware because it said, uh-huh.  It agreed with me.  No.  I didn't know he's a ventriloquist out his back end. 
[00:14:00]  The guy's amazing.  That's not being aware.  You listen to the tape.  It sounds like...  Uh-huh.  You answered his butt.  I was being very aware.  I heard it.  We played it on the show a couple times now.  How many people did?  In the middle of a conversation, Jimmy does what he has to do.  It sounds like a, uh-huh.  And you're asking, where did that come from?  Who's talking to me?  Answer me.  Okay.  I slipped up once.  I answered his butt.  Anyway, go ahead.  But I'm very jumpy. 
[00:14:30]  I'm one of these people that, like, I don't like...  Not that I'm afraid of the dark, but I prefer the light, like, in the house.  When it's pitch black, when we wake up to come in, it's pitch black.  But I've gotten to the point now where I walk down the stairs and into the kitchen and everything  in pitch darkness, and then I flip a light on so that I can get my keys and leave the  house.  So it's pitch black.  I walk down the stairs, and I'm walking through the dark, and what do I hear? 
[00:15:00]  Scares the bejesus out of me.  R2-D2 is left on the floor.  Thinks it's a home invasion.  He grabs his shotgun.  I can't grab my shotgun.  I've had to unload them and put them up where kids can't get them.  That's another reason I hate kids.  Kids and guns don't mix, and I'd rather have the guns.  You can't throw a child at an intruder.  Oh, you can.  Trust me. 
[00:15:30]  And it might slow them down a little for me to get out, but I'd rather shoot them.  There's a lot of things you can't do with a gun.  I'm having a Jimmy visual right now.  Yeah.  You got the house guests and the kids.  Yeah.  And I'm imagining one of these kids, you know, going to the bathroom in the middle of the night with their big doe eyes, with that innocent face of theirs.  Blink, blink, blink, blink.  And they see you in some horrific situation.  And you're underpants and half your uniform on your pants. 
[00:16:00]  My SS hat on sideways with the little kid as he's going into the bathroom going, Mr.  Mr., what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Last night, Uncle Anthony said he would hose down my car.  What does that mean?  I just like my independence.  That's pretty much it.  And we have house guests. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Tell Jimmy what happened yesterday.  So that's fine.  Well, yesterday, my girlfriend and my girlfriend's sister, who is the mom of three boys, all went to New York City, came into New York City to go to Times Square and Toys R Us to get a bunch of toys to play with in the house.  And so I was alone for a big part of the day.  By the way, don't worry.  Once I got home. 
[00:17:00]  Those toys won't be scratching your wood floors or anything.  Or your really nice molding.  Don't worry about it.  Brand new house.  Brand new house.  Don't even worry about it.  I noticed my ottoman was moved in the reading room, which is wood floor.  Now, I don't have the rubber cups yet that go under the wood legs of the ottoman.  So if you move the ottoman without lifting it and moving it, it could scratch the wood floor.  And I noticed it moved.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't do anything.  But it was on my mind.  Why don't you just take a little look-see under there? 
[00:17:30]  No.  No, I'm not looking.  I'm not looking until everyone's gone.  Then I'll look.  I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to wait until the house guests are gone.  And then I'm just going to look at everything and have it fixed.  I'm not going to go meal piece looking one thing at the time.  So now that the ottoman's moved, there's probably scratches on that floor.  And you will look.  No, no.  It'll be moved.  Don't.  You task me. 
[00:18:00]  It'll be moved.  You task me.  Oh, yeah.  It'll be moved.  Are there scratches, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Without a doubt.  What do you think moved it?  Your girl wouldn't move it.  No, it hasn't been moved.  It's been in the same exact spot the whole time.  Yeah, and one of the kids probably just bumped his knees into it and pushed it.  Uncle Anthony with his dirty fingers and pushed it.  Anthony's going to have to get his special suit on so he can get on his hands and knees to study the damage.  And the booger fiesta is going to be on every doorknob of that house.  It's not a booger fiesta. 
[00:18:30]  Please, no.  Oh, it's got to hurt when you know it's a brand new house, too.  Old house, you're like, eh, whatever.  Brand new house.  Brand new molding.  Brand new wood floors.  You know what I also love about a new house?  It's just like a new car.  You have the new house smell, right?  And it smells like paint, brand new wood, and new carpet.  Like that whole thing.  When you walk into a brand new house, it's like, oh, I love that.  It's great.  So yesterday, now here's what happened. 
[00:19:00]  They went to the city.  So I was alone.  I was in my office computing, doing what I do every day.  And then they came home later that afternoon, earlier evening.  And so I go out to say hi, and there's just now toy boxes being ripped open.  The entire island in the kitchen is covered with transformers and toys that are being put together and batteries and things.  So I'm just like, my head is spinning. 
[00:19:30]  My head is spinning.  It's Christmas in June for you.  It's Christmas in June.  And it's just like noise.  There's a lot of loudness going on.  And R2-D2 is rolling around on the floor.  And kids are yelling for things.  And then I notice a big glass of chocolate milk gets spilled all over the island.  And it not only hits the island, but water falls off the side, onto the stool, and onto the floor. 
[00:20:00]  And I'm just like, I'm shaking.  But I'm not saying anything.  But I'm shaking.  When are you putting the house up for sale?  Two weeks.  When are you leaving?  Two weeks.  So I'm like, I'm shaking.  And then the youngest child, Vincent, comes walking over to his mommy.  And his mommy goes, you're making a poopy, aren't you? 
[00:20:30]  I guess moms can tell from the look on the kid's face whether.  Yeah, it looks like he's doing calculus.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I can't think what that looks like.  I said, you know, parents, they know what this is.  This is all new to people that have kids, I guess.  But I don't have kids, so I don't know.  And I guess if an adult was doing it, I'd be able to look at Jimmy and know he was too. 
[00:21:00]  But I don't pay attention to that kind of thing.  So at that point, I turned around, walked right back into the same little office room that I'd been sitting in for hours,  and shut the door, because all I could think of was the kids going to the bathroom in my kitchen, in his pants, you know, in his diaper.  But he's just going to the bathroom there, and I'm just thinking of, like, my house is going to have that nursery smell to it. 
[00:21:30]  That chocolate milk spilled.  How long have they been there?  They've been there for a while already, though, right?  No, they've only – they've just begun.  Oh, that was their first full day.  Oh, they've just begun to wreak havoc.  The stupid R2-D2 is going to be bumping into your little molding on the floor and scratching it up.  Over and over again.  Over and over again.  Huge moldings.  Oh, it's going to be – welcome to a Steve Martin movie.  That's going to be awful.  Do you know, I have – it's very open, my house.  Like, you walk in the front door, you could see clean through the back and stuff. 
[00:22:00]  And in order to do this, you need these metal I-beam joists.  But you've got to hide them, but we don't want them hidden in walls.  So there are columns in parts of my house that hold these things up, and they're covered up with other things.  And I've been so careful as to not kick the bottom of the columns because they're painted white.  Oh.  And they're wonderful.  I just – I'm going to have to wait.  I'm going to have to just wait.  I'll be just as careful as you are. 
[00:22:30]  No, I'll have to wait.  I'll have to wait.  Wait until the first time you go to grab a doorknob, and you're like, what is this clear stuff all over the door?  And you realize it's from little baby fingers.  What?  They cough into their hands.  They don't know any better.  You know what?  You know –  Last week, last week, my girlfriend's other sister came over with a young daughter, like two years old.  So I go to use the bathroom that I always use, which is on the first floor there, and I open it up, and there's this contraption on the toilet, which I guess is a small little potty thing. 
[00:23:00]  It's so funny to hear Anthony talk about – you know how many people out there right now are like, yeah, of course we know what it is.  Dude, it's alien to me.  You're the only one that doesn't know what kids are about in the entire world.  I despise them.  But people know what that is.  I despise their accoutrement.  I despise everything that goes along with them. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, there's such equipment that is needed.  So I go in, and I really got to go, and I fling the door open, and I'm like, what am I supposed to do with that?  You're supposed to sit there and make, mister.  No, I'm supposed to now go upstairs.  I'm supposed to now go upstairs.  Yeah, you tell me the story before the show, and when the mom said, are you making a poopy, you, like, just disappeared to your office.  I ran away.  I just had to leave the situation between the toys all over, the chocolate milk, and then the, you're making a poopy. 
[00:24:00]  I just had to run.  I was so jealous when you moved into that nice place, all the new smells, the carpet smell.  Oh, they're just wrecking it.  I love these kids.  Hey, we're going to take a break, but let's read the instant feedback from Chris Patterson from Philly.  See, there's people like this that write instant feedback, and they think they're getting to us. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, Chris from Philadelphia, Chris Patterson, I just caught about 15 minutes of you guys when I ran out for breakfast.  Could you possibly have a more boring and pointless show?  No wonder you have to get people to F inside churches for ratings.  Ah, what's the matter, Chris?  Your pal ain't here no more.  Sorry.  Ain't coming back either, Chris.  Chris, was that supposed to get to us?  Ooh, you got us.  You know something from Philly, what a coincidence that he sends from Philly because we had huge ratings in Philly, Chris. 
[00:25:00]  It ain't working.  Sorry.  People are coming on board and listening.  We'll give you another try, though, Chris, all right?  Yeah.  You could try to write another instant feedback that might actually get to us.  Yeah, I won't ban you.  Loser.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We got lots to do today.  We got some Mantown promos coming in, by the way.  Mantown.  Speaking of Boston and WBCN, we got some Mantown promos, and we're looking for the listeners to submit their Mantown promos. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know if we've gotten any yet.  No, not yet.  We got one that BCN made.  We got one that one of our guys made here in New York, Tim, and we also have Dave Wellington's answer machine.  Oh, really?  Yeah, if he's not picking up, we got his answer machine.  It's all about us and Mantown.  It's really, really funny.  Okay, so we're going to do that, and we got some other things to do as well, including the AOL customer service guy we played earlier in the week on the other side of the Opie and Anthony show on XM.  Yeah, made the news. 
[00:26:00]  It made the news big time.  Who is he?  There's a huge follow-up.  You know, the guy trying to cancel AOL, and we played it over at XM.  Why couldn't he cancel?  I might not have been there.  Maybe you weren't there.  Maybe it was, oh, cool.  Then you're going to love this.  You're going to love this, Jimmy.  This happens any time you try to cancel, because I had a problem trying to cancel AOL.  You know what?  We'll do this next, because Jimmy hasn't heard it.  I'm scared.  We'll play the original phone call, and then we got the follow-up to the story for the people that did hear the original phone call, okay?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:26:30]  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good, because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha. 
[00:27:00]  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not that.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks to call him.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

We got the Pal Talk cameras on and everyone's watching us go up to the buffet and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat.  Courtesy of WYSP today in Philadelphia.  They sent up food. 
[00:28:00]  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  If you're on Pal Talk, we're having a contest.  Whoever can I.M.  Anthony, the funniest food name.  So if you're on Pal Talk and you want to introduce me.  Don't even start.  You are a smartass.  Anthony doesn't like to be I.M.  At all.  No.  No I.M.  Because it covers up my whole screen.  People think they're the only one I.M.  And they I.M.  it.  And you know what happens when you get a screen full of I.M.  You can't see what's under them.  No I.M.  No.  Let's say hi to Frank in the Bronx. 
[00:28:30]  Frank, what's up?  Frank.  Frank.  No.  No, Frank.  Bronx.  Bronx.  Just so you're at on a bus.  You.  You.  You.  Yeah.  Our faces are on New York City buses all over the place.  Ooh.  It's a little strange.  You're walking down the sidewalk.  And you see a bus go by with your face on it.  Oh.  We've been doing radio a pretty long time now.  And we've never had anything like that before.  No.  The bus ads are pretty cool.  I mean we had a huge banner courtesy of XM that hung off Madison Square Garden for a while. 
[00:29:00]  That was really, really cool as well.  Yeah, but Madison Square Garden doesn't drive around.  It just kind of stays there.  As far as I know.  As far as I know.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  Yeah, it's really weird to have ads on city buses.  Yeah.  But very, very cool.  All right.  We got the AOL thing.  We played this, I guess it's last week when Jimmy was in L.A. doing Jay Leno.  Jimmy hasn't heard this.  Oh.  Little show called The Tonight Show.  Jimmy was on.  Yeah, just a little.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  It was my friend.  One of those late night.  It's like a cable access show or something like that.  Sure.  Public access.  Well, this guy, isn't he a fan of the show?  Because he sent it in to us, then he called us, and now it's a national story.  Was it the guy, or was it just the guy that had the audio?  Oh, I don't know.  That's the trick.  It seemed like this guy was a fan of the show.  If I'm mistaken, I'm mistaken, whatever.  But basically, this guy called AOL and wanted to cancel his account.  And he recorded this on purpose?  Yeah.  Okay.  Got AOL in trouble, and there's a follow-up to the story. 
[00:30:00]  Good.  And the funny thing is, Anthony tried to do the exact same thing and had the same kind  of crap happen to him.  Same stuff.  It took us so long to cancel my AOL account, which I had for five years or so without  ever using it.  I completely forgot my name and password.  I never used it.  There's no reason.  It's internet training wheels, is what it is, which is fine for some people.  But once you pass a certain point, you just don't need it anymore.  You get your internet service provider, and you're online.  Now you can find things, whatever you need, unless you're a complete dolt. 
[00:30:30]  I just like AOL.  I mean, I hate it in the sense that it's kind of awful, but it's inconvenient sometimes.  But I like to have all my buddies.  Yeah.  It was good at first because it organized everything for you.  Yeah.  But now, I mean, that's happening all over the place.  It's pretty organized.  You could cruise around the internet without needing the training wheels.  Do you use AIM?  Like AIM?  No, I don't use AIM.  How do you instant message?  I don't instant message.  People email me.  I email them back.  If they want to instant message me, they could text me on my phone or call me. 
[00:31:00]  I like to talk to my friends live.  I go on PAL talk or message boards.  My IM days are over.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  Sick of it, right?  Yeah.  I get some emails and answer them.  I'm actually going back to talking to people on the phone.  Yeah.  I'm going retro.  I'm retro-ing it.  The big, black, heavy telephone that goes brrring.  I've decided that I am conversations are useless. 
[00:31:30]  Yep.  And, yeah, I'm picking up the phone.  I'm starting to pick up the phone again.  Talking to him.  Right.  Like a human being.  But, um, here we go.  So the guy wants to cancel AOL and he recorded the whole thing.  This is great audio.  Because the guy just wants, cancel my account, I got to move on.  It should be that easy.  The guy would not let him off the phone.  Nope.  Hi, this is John at AOL.  How may I help you today?  I wanted to cancel my account.  Sorry to hear that.  Go ahead and pull your account up here real quick. 
[00:32:00]  Can I have your name, please?  Vincent.  Okay, Vincent.  As for privacy and security, can I have the last four days of your payment method, please?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  It doesn't count for a long time.  Yep.  It's just quite a bit.  What was causing you to turn this off today?  I don't use it anymore.  Do they have a high-speed connection, like a DSLR cable?  Yep.  Okay.  So far, so good, right?  All right.  So far, so good.  And this is what they do, yeah.  As a company, you've got to give them this much. 
[00:32:30]  You're like, all right.  This is him hunting.  Now, you have the high-speed, and now he's going to give you the sales pitch about the high-speed that they offer.  It's all a big sales pitch when you try to cancel.  It's amazing.  And this, quickly, this is everything that you have to deal with on the phone with any company when you try to do anything.  I call up American Express to have a problem taken care of, and you have to sit through a big commercial first before you can even get to the person you have to get to to solve your problem. 
[00:33:00]  You know what's annoying about AOL?  I've called for problems.  I was having a problem where, I've given this out many times, yellow treats.  AOL is my email.  And it was for public and for fans who wanted to contact me or IM me when I'm around.  I'll talk to you.  Yeah.  And young ladies.  Yeah, well, you know, occasionally a gal might say, hi.  Young ladies.  Why not?  It's not important.  Why not?  But I wasn't showing up on people's instant message list.  I don't know why.  So I called AOL, and they want to confirm, I just want to have your social security number for confirmation. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  Then you get the next foreigner on the phone.  I only have this for confirmation number.  It's like, why did you just ask me to confirm it by pushing buttons and by telling you and then ask me the same crap over it?  It's awful.  It's like with Amex.  They make you put in your, they punch in your card number, and then you get somebody on the line, and they need your card number.  You say, why did I punch that in?  I punched it in.  Eww.  It's just annoying.  All right.  So let's get back to the audio.  So so far, so good. 
[00:34:00]  You've got to give them this much.  Okay.  The guy wants to cancel.  Oh, have you had that?  Years.  Years.  Okay.  Well, actually, I'm showing a lot of usage on this account.  Yeah, a long time ago.  Not recently.  Oh, the Poff's account was on 71 hours since the 24th of last month.  No, he wasn't.  He doesn't even have the AOL software installed on his computer.  You're looking at AIM usage, probably.  No, AIM usage doesn't come on to this.  He doesn't have the AOL software installed on his computer. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, this is your father, man?  Yep.  Okay.  Well, I'm looking at this account.  Either way, whatever you're saying.  Well, what's causing him to turn this off today?  I mean, obviously, I mean.  I don't use it, and he doesn't use it, so we're canceling.  I'm telling you, he doesn't use the account.  The software is not even on his computer.  No.  Well, okay.  I mean, is there a problem with the software itself?  No, I just, I don't need it.  Oh, my God.  I don't need it.  I don't want it.  I just don't need it anymore.  Is this amazing, Jimmy? 
[00:35:00]  It's just, and just the fact that he's going into, I'm looking here at how much usage, you know, that's a little invasive, isn't it?  It's a, it's a, he shouldn't know that.  Yeah, he's sounding a bit intimidating.  He's just a jerk-off.  Oh, yes.  Let's hear it.  Break it down.  Yes.  Your psychological profile of the guy is a jerk-off.  Well, I'm looking, your father's used it in the past. 
[00:35:30]  Has he?  Did he?  Cancel it.  I'm looking, he's in the men looking for like, like same, men for men by curious chat room.  He's been in that one.  Right.  That's how we joked about this last week.  Because he sounds so intimidating.  Like he knows everything.  He knows everything about it.  He's like, all right, all right.  I don't need to cancel AOL.  Would you like me to send you copies of the pictures he's been exchanging with certain people? 
[00:36:00]  AOL online, because we could do that.  Yes.  Men looking for men who resemble their sons.  He's in that one.  All right.  He's in that room a lot.  I could cancel the account, and I'll send these transcripts off to Dateline, because I'm sure  they would love to have a chat with your dad.  Is your mom home?  I want to talk to her about this.  All right.  Keep the account.  Goodbye.  Keep the account.  Whatever it takes.  Just shut up.  I'll send double.  I'll send double.  Just shut up.  So when you use the computer, I'm saying, is that for business or for school? 
[00:36:30]  What difference does it make?  I don't want the AOL account anymore.  Can we please cancel it?  Well, on June 2nd, this account was signed on.  It's been on for 72 hours.  On June 2nd.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  Last year was 540.  Last month was 545 hours of usage.  I don't know how to make this any clearer, so I'm just going to say it one last time.  Cancel the account, please.  Well, explain to me what's... 
[00:37:00]  I'm not explaining anything to you.  Cancel the account.  Well, what's the matter, man?  I'm just trying to help here.  You're not helping me.  You're helping me with...  I am trying to...  Okay.  Helping me...  Listen, I called to cancel the account.  Helping me would be canceling the account.  Please help me and cancel my account.  No, I wouldn't, actually.  Cancel my account.  Turn off your account.  Cancel the account.  The worst thing to...  Cancel the account.  Is your dad there?  My dad...  I'm the primary person on the account.  Not my dad.  Cancel.  This guy's in his 30s, by the way.  The guy? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You hear it and go, is your dad there?  You're almost thinking, well, maybe if this kid is like 14 or 15, the representative wants  to talk to his dad for the...  No.  This guy's in his 30s.  My jaw is tightening as I'm listening to this.  Oh, yeah.  I want to bite.  I hope this guy got fired.  Uh, they said he is no longer with the company.  We got...  Yeah, we'll have an update on the whole thing.  Bye, douchebag.  But he's very intimidating.  No, he's not.  He wanted...  You want to... 
[00:38:00]  You want to...  You want to do...  You want to grab his neck, like where his neck and his cheek and fold them together and  sink your teeth into them and make the yummy noise.  I love this guy.  Cancel the account.  Well, I'm just trying to...  Yeah.  Cancel it.  I've noticed that you've Googled just legal a thousand times in the last 30 days.  Jeez, uh...  You sure you still want to cancel the account?  You want to cancel it?  Uh...  Yeah, because I'm just trying to figure out...  Cancel the account. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know how to make this any clearer for you.  Cancel the account.  The card is mine in my name.  The account is mine and in my name.  When I say cancel the account, I don't mean help me figure out how to keep it.  I mean cancel the account.  Well, I'm sorry.  I don't know what anybody's done to you, Vincent, but this is...  You're annoying the s*** out of me.  That's what you're doing to me.  Cancel the account, please.  Okay.  And that goes both ways, my friend.  Good.  Can you please cancel the account?  All right.  Someday, when you calm down, you're going to realize all I was trying to do was help you 
[00:39:00]  and it was actually in your best interest to listen to.  Wonderful.  Okay, yeah, great.  When that epiphany happens, then just give us a call back every time.  Wait.  As a process or cancellation request, I think they've got a free benefit available for  to provide members like yourself.  See?  No.  No.  You hear this part?  I don't want it.  I know the drill.  I don't even want it.  Don't even bother.  If you want me to cancel this account, you're going to let me speak.  No.  See?  And give a paragraph.  Okay?  Because if not, we can't.  That's where the guy...  I don't really care.  That's where the guy...  You don't have to sit through a sales pitch when you want to cancel an account. 
[00:39:30]  You say, if you want me to cancel this...  No, there's no conditions on it.  I don't have to sit through your drivel.  You just cancel the account.  Because none of these scumbags give their whole names.  You've got to ask for the whole name or an ID number.  They'll give it to you in the beginning of the call before it goes awry.  Hi, who am I speaking John?  How would I get back to you?  Or whatever.  They'll usually give you a number.  Yeah.  And then...  Or just tape it.  That was brilliant.  Or just tape it.  Oh, the guy is actually... 
[00:40:00]  You know, because they probably...  I'm sure AOL tells these people, look, when someone tries to cancel, you try your best.  Here's the script or whatever we like to do to keep them as customers.  And I'm sure they high-five, like, you know, hang up and go, hey, another cancellation.  I kept them, though.  Hey, good job.  Good job.  How'd you do it?  I intimidated the hell out of them.  When I noticed they spent 200 hours on pigtailbabes.com and I brought it to their attention, they  got very nervous and decided to keep the account.  Yeah, this guy... 
[00:40:30]  Good job.  Good job.  Cruising braces and bubblegum.  Right.  But you're going to listen to me if you want this or not.  So, can I speak now?  Go right ahead.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  He gave in.  As I process, he can't switch your quest.  He knows he's taping it, too.  What happens here? 
[00:41:00]  He's just babbling and babbling and babbling.  The guy just hangs up.  Mm-hmm.  We know you, we know you, and so I keep your same email.  Just go to AOL.com, log into the screen name and password, and email confirming the cancellation  we deliver to your free AOL.com email for 24 hours.  Complete this cancellation.  It's a lot of important details to this whole life today.  Bet you've got to sit through this.  And then he just, the guy just gave up and hung up.  Gave up.  Just hung up on that try.  He'd had enough.  Just cancel it. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, I want to smash this guy's teeth in.  But they're all like this.  It's just, any company you call for customer service, it is a nightmare.  I got my Amex, and it was expired.  It was expiring in like a week.  And I called him up and said, hey, maybe you should send me a new card.  Like, oh, we send the cards later now than we used to.  We used to send them a lot earlier, so don't worry, you'll get it.  Never got it.  So I went to use it, and it was expired.  How embarrassing. 
[00:42:00]  So I called him back and said, hey, you never sent me a card.  Well, we did send it.  Well, I didn't get it.  So, okay, we'll send a new one out.  They send a new one out.  It doesn't have the corporate name on it, on the bottom.  And then the guy's telling me, okay, what you have to do is fax me a copy of the old card with the corporate name.  I said, no, no.  You know what it is.  You know all the info that's been there.  I've been a member since like 94.  He goes, so just send me a new card.  Well, we can't do that.  I hung up with him, just hung right up on him, called back up. 
[00:42:30]  Supervisor, please get me.  I want to talk to a supervisor.  I'm such an ass.  I turn into, as Patrice O'Neill calls me, white entitled guy.  But I got him on the phone, and he was like, we're very sorry, Mr. Kumi.  We're very sorry.  They're all very sorry whenever you have a problem.  Well, I want to continue apologizing for this.  Very sorry.  Very sorry.  We want to give you a credit.  I'm going to put a credit here of $100 on your account. 
[00:43:00]  You go out to dinner on American Express, and we'll send that card out to you.  You don't need to fax in.  Who told you that, by the way?  I go, I don't know.  I didn't ask for a name.  Always get the name.  Hopefully he's got children that are sick, and he can be fired, and his insurance cut off.  I had a problem with a bank recently.  I had to open up another checking account.  It's a long story, but they were asking for all sorts of stuff, and they were being a real pain in the ass, right?  So I called up the supervisor, and I said, I'm just letting you know I am canceling. 
[00:43:30]  I'm pulling all my money out of your bank, and you might want to look up the account.  The number is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I never do this in my life, right?  Yeah.  I had so many people calling me that afternoon.  What can we do?  What can we do?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We'll come to your house right now, and we'll get you a limo, and we'll drive you to the bank,  and we'll take care of this immediately.  How much do you have?  Jesus.  How much does he have?  I got a courtesy call once, and I threatened to do that.  Would you like it in fives? 
[00:44:00]  With Ovi, it's like the banker on the Beverly Hillbillies to the Clampetts.  Right.  What's his name?  Yeah.  Mr. Drysdale?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yes, okay, Mr. Clampetts.  We'll be right over.  But I'm thinking to myself, how am I going to take care of this problem?  Like, I can't believe they're giving me all this crap.  Yeah.  So I pulled out that card.  Oh, boy.  And, man, did the doors open.  Man, did they open.  You must have a lot in there.  Jesus.  Well, I don't dress the part.  When I go to the bank, they treat me like crap and stuff because they think I'm just like 
[00:44:30]  a college kid opening up my first checking account.  College kid?  No one thinks you're a college kid.  I mean.  They think I'm just a high school boy.  You know.  Maybe DeVry.  Yeah, right?  So they think I'm a college kid.  They think I'm putting my communion money in and they give me guff.  Well, you know what I mean?  Just like, you know, just getting my first freaking bank account going with who cares 
[00:45:00]  money.  Like, it doesn't matter to them whatsoever how much I got in this stupid account.  That is funny.  Stupid bank.  Yeah, I guess college kid would have been a little silly.  Yeah, and I try to make a deposit.  She said, did the tooth fairy give you this?  Trust me, I pulled off the college kid thing for way too many years after I graduated, so  I guess I got to move on from that one, officially.  All right.  Here's the follow-up to the AOL story, by the way. 
[00:45:30]  We spoke with Ferrari by phone.  That part is I meant that comment, by the way.  That's funny.  I meant every second.  Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life.  That's the only college thing I have going for myself.  We spoke with Ferrari by phone.  Is your dad there?  Ferrari.  My dad.  I think I could have probably put up with everything, but at the point where he asked  me to speak to my father, I came very close to losing it at that point.  How old are you?  I'm 30.  Ferrari posted the call online, and the response was tremendous. 
[00:46:00]  AOL sent him an apology.  Chris Dinovi of J.D. Power says companies talk about customer satisfaction, but see the  call center as a costly investment.  They're trying to squeeze every penny out of that call center without regard for what  may be happening, the damage may be done.  AOL tells us in a statement that the incident is inexcusable, that John violated guidelines  and is no longer with the company.  Quote, we're going to learn from this. 
[00:46:30]  We can do better and will.  Oh, will you?  My AOL, and again, I'm there just because so many people have my email address.  I had my AOL experience when I had this technical problem was abominable.  Yeah.  I want, I'm not appearing on people's IM screens.  They're not seeing me as signed on.  I am signed on.  I'm not blocking anyone.  I have no privacy settings on.  Why is it not showing up?  And the abomination I had to go through to get this fixed, I can't tell you what a nightmare 
[00:47:00]  it was.  It is.  It's just frustrating.  Well, the lesson today, start recording these calls.  Yeah.  Start recording these calls.  That's what you got to do because look at the results this guy got.  Very nice.  If I can record calls, though, the last thing I'm going to do is call AOL.  It's going to be with, uh, Kenny just held a note up in front of Jimmy's face in mid-sentence.  Hold on.  Kenny's starting to feel really good with himself in the studio.  Made you change name. 
[00:47:30]  Is that what?  Well, no, what he's saying is, yeah.  This is what happened.  That he's a big dope.  That's obvious.  He was very excited to show you that.  He actually traipsed over.  Yeah.  My original name, I won't say.  Let's just say it was something drinker.  Right.  My favorite beverage, a salty, popcorn-y beverage.  Who doesn't love it?  After a hard night of asparagus eating.  Usually served up warm.  Absolutely.  Hold the dignity.  And, uh, I was having problems on a mass mailing. 
[00:48:00]  So, they got red flagged when they saw my name.  They went, wait, this is a term of service violation.  It annoyed me.  It was right after we got kicked off the air.  Yeah.  And I didn't have a mailing list.  So, I could kind of understand why they flagged it.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're really late.  The story of the day is on the TV right now.  We got to get that immediately.  The fast food zoning story.  You're not going to believe this one.  Also, we'll play some Mantown stuff.  We got some home run calls that went awry.  I guess the Mets and Yankees is a bunch of blown home run calls in the last few games. 
[00:48:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Travis or somebody grabbed them for us.  And then we got the classic Bob Murphy.  Bob Murphy.  The Bob Murphy mess up.  So, we got lots of radio to do today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when you're in the kitchen?  See, I hope you're there for the show.  I want to be on you. 
[00:49:00]  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetie.  If you walk past them, don't take your jewelry and take your purse.  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about the real dirty-looking peaking lobby.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  Is this the O.P. and Anthony Show?  Yes.  Okay.  O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thanks a lot.  We appreciate that.  And you're getting rid of the box, you know?  Yeah, I see you got some boxing gloves over there, Jimmy.  Dude, if I...  Yeah, what are you doing?  Yeah, you know, you hit the bag a little bit.  Yeah?  I think one of the things Kate liked about me was my upper body.  Oh.  Right.  Has she called you?  Her assistant.  Her assistant?  Well, that's the way it is.  Yeah, she was going to come to the show.  No.  No, that's not the way it is. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Her assistant called.  Yes.  We're obviously talking about Kate Beckinsale or...  Beckinsale.  Yes.  Kate Beckinsale.  The beautiful Kate Beckinsale who Jimmy met while they were both doing The Tonight Show.  And somehow, I don't know how it happened, she got Jimmy's phone number.  The digits, we call it in the business.  The digits.  She said something about dog, let me get those digits.  Right.  Right.  And she said she was coming to New York, she's here, and she said when she was here, she 
[00:50:30]  was going to call you because she wanted to see you do some stand-up at the Comedy Cellar.  Yeah.  Great comedy club, by the way.  So her assistant called you?  Yesterday.  To set something up?  Yeah.  She's like, you know, Kate wanted me to call you and wants to know when you're performing  and all this and that.  So now, she'll go at some point to see you.  Yeah.  I don't know if she'll come tonight or if she's in town early next week.  I don't know.  Well, whenever it is.  Yeah.  She'll come and see you.  And then, what do you...  You're a guy. 
[00:51:00]  You have to have some type of fantasy way this plays out, Jimmy.  Yeah, I do.  Okay.  She comes.  I've blown up the photo of this.  I ask her to sign it.  We never see each other again.  Hey, that's...  He's realistic.  He's being realistic.  Everyone else would have that tiny bit of hope that you would be hanging at that back  table with her and really cracking her up.  And she's like, oh my God, you're so funny.  Well, because if it went through, like, her getting your phone number, an assistant calling, 
[00:51:30]  setting up some kind of, you know, time and making sure she's taken care of and everything,  then there has to be more of a meeting after the whole thing than just, hey, thanks, goodbye.  True.  Like, do you have a plan?  Not so much a plan, but a kind of a...  I want to use the word fantasy.  It's like, what...  Did it play out in your head how something good might go?  Um, I haven't, no, because unfortunately, my self-esteem is not only bad, it's accurate. 
[00:52:00]  But it was just...  No, she wants to...  Like, maybe, like, like, like, like, uh, hey, Kate, did you like the show?  Yeah, wow, you're so funny.  It was really good.  I had a great time.  Uh, what do you do?  You maybe want to go out for a cup of coffee or something, or, all right, that sounds great.  Like, something like that plays out in your head, and then you and her are sitting at  some little booth in a diner, and you're spending hours talking, realizing how much in  common, uh, you have, and, and, did that play out in your head? 
[00:52:30]  No.  He's hoping...  No, look at him.  Look at him, he just goes, no.  You're not hoping for a little bite to eat somewhere else, maybe?  It could happen like that.  You're in a situation now.  What would she...  What would you do if she said, hey, you want to go grab a bite to eat somewhere else away  from all this craziness?  Look, taking all of it off of him.  Now she's asking...  Look, at least I kept it real with Jimmy asking.  How about this?  Her saying yes was the fantasy part of that.  I've hung out with Jimmy.  He's not asking her crap.  How about I say no, and she begs and hangs onto my feet as I walk down the street? 
[00:53:00]  Jimmy's not asking her to go eat or anything like that.  She'll be with...  I'm sure she'll be with somebody, whether it's an assistant or a friend.  I mean, they...  She's really famous, man.  They can't get too well by herself and pop into the cellar.  You know what's going to happen?  She's going to see you kill and leave with Artie Fuqua.  It really is.  That's exactly what happens.  They meet Sherrod.  They see some other comic and just leave.  Oh.  Oh.  I haven't...  I actually have not thought about it.  I won't ask her to sign my picture.  I'm not that big of a nerd.  No.  No.  You've got to ask her.  Nah.  But Jimmy...  Because it is going to be the last time you see her. 
[00:53:30]  You've got to understand this.  You have nothing to lose.  But he's in a situation that can, like, be good.  Yeah.  You're set up here.  Things are lining up.  You're not...  There's...  You're not at the end yet.  But there's something happening here.  There's opportunity.  No.  She's...  I have to be realistic.  She wants to come just to see the show because she maybe enjoyed it.  And we got along.  We were chatting on the couch.  But that's what I mean.  It's a beginning.  It's something that can...  If...  It can at least be friends.  You have to do something here. 
[00:54:00]  You can't just let her go without saying, do you want to maybe grab a cup of coffee?  Or just out to where you two can then be alone in another place.  Look at that.  She's a comedy club.  She sees you.  Likes you.  Now get her somewhere else.  Now you're building something called a relationship where now you have different places that you've been.  Different things you're talking about.  Different environments make for different conversations.  Now you're out of your professional environment.  She's out of hers.  You're alone together. 
[00:54:30]  Now you can start sharing a little more personal conversation.  Oh, Jesus.  You got to look at her like she's any other broad.  Any other broad.  What?  And bring you in on it?  So you can tag team her?  Why are you handing me $50?  Hey, let's get a Max in Oklahoma City.  Max, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  What's going on?  Hey.  I just had a question for Jimmy.  You think maybe Kate Beckinsale put plastic tarps down on the ground, too? 
[00:55:00]  Could be something you guys have in common.  Plastic tarps.  Can you imagine?  Oh, God.  I didn't hear what he said.  Yeah, lining his...  Jimmy aligned his bathroom and his apartment with plastic.  She has the same hobbies as you.  And let her in on a little secret, Jimmy.  I see you're always repenting as well.  Well, people are saying she's a dirty girl, so you never know.  Maybe.  But believe me, if I thought there was a shot, all I would do is be crulling about it. 
[00:55:30]  Well, everyone is saying she's married to some director dude.  But I heard that she was going through a divorce.  I heard she was going through a divorce.  Come on.  You're the perfect guy for a girl who used to get even.  Right.  I think that she's supposed to come.  Imagine a picture of them coming out of a place together.  That's who I was with.  And the husband season.  Why are you with this?  He's an alien with a reptile neck.  Where did you find this little boy?  She throws the rag on the kitchen table.  Look.  Yeah.  They got me walking around with Jim Norton in New York City. 
[00:56:00]  And he just looks and goes, yeah, whatever.  You want to go get a bite to eat?  Yeah, he won't be jealous at all.  Like, who is this?  One of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids?  Are you scared you're going to have a bad set or a good set?  Well, I did actually switch spots because I had a really late spot.  Yeah.  And I asked Keith Robinson to switch with me because, hey, I knew she probably had to get  up and do TV and stuff.  But it's like, you don't want to bomb in front of somebody.  No.  Remember, I had that girl.  This girl I went out with, I met her, and she dated Lenny Kravitz before me.  Uh-oh.  And then she came to see me at the Boston Comedy Club, and I was hosting. 
[00:56:30]  But I came out of the gate trying to be too strong, and I was bombing so bad, I couldn't  even look at her.  And she had three friends down from Boston that she brought in.  Oh, that is bad.  She never saw me do comedy.  And it was so bad, I couldn't even look up in the corner where they were sitting.  And after the show, it was so uncomfortable.  Yeah, it was good.  No, it was.  First of all, why would you follow Lenny Kravitz?  I don't know.  I met her in Brazil when we went to Brazil.  Remember that girl, the professor?  He met a real professor. 
[00:57:00]  She was actually a beautiful girl.  Yeah, but Lenny Kravitz has got to be packing.  He's packing.  And you've discussed your thing.  He's taking her to the garden, and I take her to the Boston Comedy Club.  So wait, what happened with the friend?  This is the worst.  When you bomb, I mean, if I bombed in front of her, it would suck.  But again, when we met was on Leno, and I had a good set, and it was funny.  It was like, she met me under great circumstances.  It wouldn't be that bad.  It'd be like, ah, it's a bad night.  We all have them. 
[00:57:30]  She's a performer, so she's like, please, I'm sure she's...  I never had.  Well, you know, I'm sure she's seen it before.  She hasn't had one.  But when you...  Like, Rich has just met a chick who's a teacher, and to have her friends come from...  You don't...  You actually have a nozzle growing off you by the end of the set.  That's how you feel.  No, I met a comic, and he invited me down.  I want you girls to come and see him.  He's very funny.  Like, he seems very funny when he talks to me and stuff, so his act is probably real.  And they're just sitting there like, oh, this guy is stinking up the joint. 
[00:58:00]  And she can't even look at her dumb friends, because you're a reflection of her, you embarrassment.  Sweat.  Sweat is poor.  It's so uncomfortable.  Oh, man.  Where are you going?  Are you hosting?  I'm hosting, so now I've got to go back up again after, you know, the first set.  And it was just so...  What was it, like three or four years?  It was so horrible.  And, you know, you can't...  Because when you're hosting, if you come out and you're bombing, it's hard.  You're there all night.  All night.  Yeah, you're the guy every time that comes out. 
[00:58:30]  Now, you stink every time.  And then the crowd is going on and killing, because, you know, they're happy to see anybody.  And then the unfunny guy comes back, and they're all like, oh, this guy sucks.  Everyone is saying you have nothing to lose.  You've got to ask her out.  You've got to ask her to do something after you're safe.  Abby on the show.  I don't know if she's...  I think she's with a...  Listen to me.  I can't even say I think she's married, because I do think she's married.  But listen to me stammer.  Hey, do you think maybe we could go...  You know, if you're thirsty.  I mean, if you're not there.  Look, see, yeah, you're just...  You're a wreck.  How did I ask one girl out one time? 
[00:59:00]  The girl I was in love with when I was in high school, Michelle.  I called her on the phone.  I got her number from the phone book.  And I said, you don't want to go out with me or anything, do you?  And she said...  She was actually nice.  She went, no.  Oh!  Oh!  But I tried to be casual and use a hip expression, but be funny.  Ooh, what did though?  I said, well, that's how the ball crumbles.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God.  That's terrific. 
[00:59:30]  It was either that, or I said, that's how the cookie bounces.  I did one of the two.  Oh, good.  What should I use?  I switched them.  Should I go with bouncing cookie?  Or a crumbling ball?  The crumbling ball.  Hmm.  Let's get some advice from a chick.  Julie in New York.  What's up, Julie?  Hey, Jimmy, you have to ask her out.  Yep.  You have to ask her out.  Girl, you know, I know you know girls, but you have to.  I mean, because she obviously is interested enough to come and see you.  She doesn't have to come and see you. 
[01:00:00]  Listen to me, though.  You have to.  There are so many other beautiful women out there, like Julia Roberts, who married Lyle Lovett.  And, my God, you are so far better looking than Lyle Lovett.  But the point is...  Oh, wow.  That's saying a lot.  It's like comparing Fork World to Scrapp.  And that lasted for a week.  And she's already got it, guys.  That's the point.  She's already got it, guys.  Hey, are you positive she's got a guy?  I am pretty sure.  Hold on now.  I'm good at...  Funny is better.  Thank you.  But what...  It is.  Is it really?  Well, nothing in my life is...  Women find funny eyes. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, Julie.  Thank you.  Thank you, Julie.  But what the problem is, is I'm pretty good at picking up on vibes.  I wish I wasn't.  I wish I was delusional.  You think you're better than you are.  Oh, God.  And you know, I never insult you, Jimmy.  When I hear you say something, I take it at face value.  You're not as good at picking up vibes as you think you are.  Oh, dude.  I never...  I'm wrong.  You, you, no, you throw off a vibe that interferes with the vibe that's coming in.  Yeah.  And it's called a complete lack of self-respect and dignity. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, they smell the fear.  Yeah.  They smell the fear.  A lot of girls throw off a vibe.  They think you're charming.  They think you're adorable.  They love your sense of humor.  And you then have this image of yourself, and that vibe goes out and interrupts the incoming vibe.  There are girls that like you and would like to get to know you better, and then what do you do?  Name 60.  You're screwed. 
[01:01:30]  60?  One.  Kate Beckinsale.  That's the biggest...  She was interested enough to get your number.  Right.  Something else might be going on there.  She does talk shows all the time.  How many comics do you think she's seen?  She goes to every one of their shows.  Maybe she's a real dirty girl and wants an action on it.  She pursues it with getting phone numbers and having assistants call and setting things up.  Jesus Christ, man.  Have some insight here on a situation.  How funny would it be if I show up at the cellar? 
[01:02:00]  I don't think it's...  I'm leaning more towards tomorrow than I just put what the assistant said.  How about if I show up at the late show Friday, and I have a suit and tie, and I have chocolates and balloons.  Like a fool.  But she brings her husband.  Oh!  This is for you, sir.  Hi.  If you want to feel comfortable, tell her you'll pick her up on 10th Avenue and 14th.  Just to stand on the corner, you'll pull up.  Just in a deep voice say, hi, daddy.  I'm going to the cellar tomorrow night. 
[01:02:30]  I've got to check this out myself.  I've got to see this.  Hamna, hamna, hamna, hamna.  You'll just be a wreck.  Well, you know, so I switched my spot earlier, and now, you know John Mayer, who's a fan of  the show, I mean, his brother, he's trying to do stand-up.  Yeah.  I think he actually went on in my spot if he showed up, if his plane came in.  So instead of me, they got him.  You have to ask, because there will be conversation afterwards.  There's going to be some kind of, she'll say, you're very funny, things like that.  You then compliment her, whatever you do. 
[01:03:00]  And then you've got to say, hey, what are you doing the rest of the night?  And then have something good planned.  You want to, whatever it is.  I got it.  Have her go to your show.  Then after, say, hey, want to go see my pal up at Caroline's, because I'm doing a  late show.  This way, you could sit there with her.  Oh, what a plugging ass.  I should have kept you on the couch.  I should have kept you on the, get back on the couch.  I was feeling good today.  I'm like, yeah, you could join the conversation.  I'm trying to help you.  Get back on the couch.  What a plugging ass he is. 
[01:03:30]  We're trying to help Jimmy out.  That's a pretty good one.  It is good.  It slipped it right in there, didn't we?  Rich Voss at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  Get on the couch, though.  You're in the penalty box.  That's what we do now.  We're setting up a penalty box in here.  There was a great one.  It updated.  Oh, okay.  Brian Hoffman from St. Cloud, Florida on the instant feedback.  Like, the first man to walk on the moon.  Jim needs to do this for all of mankind.  Yes.  Dude.  Yes.  It'll make great radio. 
[01:04:00]  You have to ask her out.  You have to.  And I'm going.  I want to wire him for sound.  Are you kidding?  I'm going to witness this.  I want you to awkwardly, like, try to get her out of the cellar to get a bite to eat.  Wearing a wire?  It'll be funny if she showed up with, like, say, her husband and an assistant.  I went, who are these two?  Yeah.  Tell him to scram.  Beat it.  No, she's not.  I am.  Look, I know you think I'm bad at getting enough vibes, but I'm good at it.  And she said, this is what happened.  And I hate to break everybody's.  I hate to break my own.  Believe me.  This is what I wish it was.  We had a nice chat on the couch to performers. 
[01:04:30]  And it was almost like, you know, hey, I thought you were pretty amusing.  I said I was from New York.  I'm going to be there.  I mean, come see your show.  Give me something to do at night with somebody who I've met before.  Kate Beckinsale needs something to do at night in New York City.  Maybe she likes comedy.  Vibe man.  Vibe man.  Kate Beckinsale needs something to do in New York City.  She's just like, ah, boy.  Ah, nothing to do.  Jimmy is going to lose his mind when she comes in.  They're going to say hi to each other. 
[01:05:00]  And her husband got, like, stuck at the door because, like, a table of five came in at  the same time.  So they kind of got split up.  And just when Jimmy is really going, oh, my God, there's something.  Hi, baby.  Big open mouth kiss in front of Jimmy.  It's just me casual, too.  Hi, honey.  Oh, by the way, Jim, this is my husband.  And you're just going to.  Hi.  Oh, no, no.  They only say one seat.  But I'll get you another one.  And he'll compliment you.  Very funny, man. 
[01:05:30]  Very funny.  Smell of really expensive cologne.  Yeah.  Man, he'll be very handsome.  Rolex watch on his wrist as he shakes your hand.  And then he'll be, okay, well, we're going to go back to the hotel and just have the  most amazing sex ever, ever, ever.  Hi, I'm Jim.  Hi, I'm everything you're not.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got to try to catch up a little bit.  Rich boss in the house.  I'm pulling for you, Jimmy.  You'll be pulling for yourself after that night of failure.  You bet I will be.  We're all pulling for you, Jimmy. 
[01:06:00]  Well, I hate to disappoint you.  Keep us updated.  Either tomorrow or Monday, we should have an update on this.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We'll get into some other things.  We've got to get into the food thing.  The food story is unbelievable.  The food thing.  Where is it?  Here.  Here.  And then we've got to do you want to do Mantown promos next?  Mantown.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well, let's do a little more Mantown.  We've got some cool things to get to.  And also, someone wants to know after, Rich.  Sit down.  Don't be so anxious. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Don't be so anxious.  Look at the window out there.  You'll get your plugs in.  You'll have plenty of people at Caroline's this weekend.  Don't be anxious.  Anxious.  Anxious.  Don't be so anxious.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, buddy.  A lot of people are asking your latest technique for quitting smoking.  So, we'll get into that next as well.  Oh, whatever.  Plenty of fodder with Rich Voss.  Of course, there is.  He already told me how he's trying to quit smoking.  And we got some stuff on him.  Trust me.  It's the only virus spreading across America. 
[01:07:00]  Welcome to the O.B. and M.  Mister, are you okay?  That really looked like I'd hurt.  Mister.  Mister.  Mister.  Okay, goodbye.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Give me, give me, give me, give me, that was done as I.  Cool.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Tell your friends we're back.  There's still a lot of people out there that don't know we're back on commercial radio. 
[01:07:30]  Also want to say hi to the XM Nation for supporting us through this whole transitional period.  What's going on with Kate Beckinsale on the instant feedback?  Some things are coming in, right, Anne?  A lot of people trying to help Jimmy out.  Instant feedback coming in with information.  Kate Beckinsale moves out of family home.  Might mean she's not happily married at the moment.  There's some reports that her and her husband are estranged, estranged from each other, which 
[01:08:00]  right there is a plus, Jimmy.  Yeah.  And then a lot of people submitting this quote that Kate has on Internet Movie Database and a lot of other sites.  It says, quote from Kate,  If someone had told me years ago that sharing a sense of humor was so vital to partnerships, I could have avoided a lot of sex.  So, get this.  She covers both things there. 
[01:08:30]  She has a lot of sex with guys.  Strangers.  Yeah, with strangers, apparently.  And what she's found out doing that is that she likes a sense of humor more so.  Yeah, this isn't it.  Now, you could give her both.  Or neither.  It depends on the night.  Both at the same time.  You having sex and her having a good laugh about the whole thing.  Or me having a bad show and then just being emasculated and trying to teach her a lesson with a mealworm.  I'll show you, miss.  Cover both bases with one act. 
[01:09:00]  With one awful, one awful no-side with the humiliation.  I think you got a good shot here.  This is probably your best shot at celebrity sex.  I would say your best shot.  No, my best shot at celebrity sex was when Eric Douglas was trying to get me to go to a party with him outside the Boston Comedy Club.  All right.  Second.  Believe me, if Michael was going to be there, I might have went with him. 
[01:09:30]  I'm going to put the dog on my back.  I'll lean over in the back.  Well, we look forward to the update, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Keep us informed, okay?  Yeah, I'm psyched for you.  We're going to try to get some other things done on the program today.  Mantown.  Mantown.  Mantown.  Mantown is alive and well in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Way out there.  Way out there.  They do this Mantown thing and it stinks.  Stinks on ice.  It just reeks of trying too hard and being a hen-pecked husband or boyfriend. 
[01:10:00]  Stupid Hillman playing right into our hands.  Hillman does mornings on AF and we're going to beat him.  We're going to beat him in the ratings.  Not today.  I don't think we beat him today, but down the road we'll beat him.  No, we've only been on a month or so.  I believe we beat him by the end of the year easily.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  I'll give you that.  And he's giving us some great fodder.  The big thing is Mantown.  Right.  Yeah.  Explain to Rich.  He's looking around all confused.  Oh, Rich.  Get this.  Get this one.  Shoot yourself if you ever have to be in this situation. 
[01:10:30]  Mantown.  It's a place where guys go to be guys.  Like, you invite your friends over and your wife or girl has told you that, you know, you  can't sit there or I don't want your friends doing this.  So it's like the basement or a shed out back.  Or the ramrod.  Or, yeah.  Exactly.  See?  Or the ramrod club down the road.  See?  We didn't even explain it to them.  Yeah.  That's what we are thinking.  Like, guys go.  You know what it is.  I guess. 
[01:11:00]  You ever see on, like, the King of Queens, he's got to go out to the garage where they  got a couch and a TV set.  That's my favorite part.  Oh, isn't that great?  Ugh.  Uh, that's what they call Mantown, where men can just hang out, drink beers with other  men and watch the game.  And talk about guy stuff.  Guy stuff.  They're doing sitcom radio.  How horrid is the whole concept of Mantown?  Mantown, where plungers are left in the toilet. 
[01:11:30]  That show's going to be canceled during commercial.  That's horrible.  It's awful.  And that's all they do.  They got Mantown, paraphernalia.  Oh, there's stickers.  Someone sent me one.  Stickers.  Where it's a martini glass.  And it says something about martinis and Mantown.  Like, you're just sitting there going, I think it's martini day on Mantown.  Come on.  Don't forget your martini class, Bob.  Clink, clink, clink.  The game's on.  Let's go down to Mantown. 
[01:12:00]  I don't have any salt for the martini.  Here, let me lift this thing up here and rub it.  I just cut the lawn.  This ought to smell salty after I'm done rubbing my martini glass on it.  Go ahead.  Drink out of it.  What's next?  Provincetown?  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  Just kind of.  It's this very homoerotic place.  Yeah.  So let's get right into it.  They played right into our hands.  We're having a lot of fun with Mantown. 
[01:12:30]  And the rest of the country's having a lot of fun with Mantown.  They get it.  They get how stupid this radio bit is.  And listeners are starting to send in their Mantown promos.  BCN, who's just great up there in Boston.  We love the new WBCN.  These guys are so freaking aggressive up there.  They get our show, and they're pushing, pushing, pushing hard up there.  Re-energized.  This guy, Dave Wellington, is unbelievable.  He's the program director up there.  And he is just so motivated to take down AF and the rest of the Boston radio market.  Love it.  So here's the latest Mantown promo that BCN is running up there in Boston. 
[01:13:00]  You know, when you're a mediocre talent in a small radio market like Mantown,  it's always nice to have true radio professionals in a major market dissect your career.  You know the reality that you've been just rotting in Worcester your entire radio career.  Discuss your talents.  Bill Matt is the king of the ass kissers.  Give you advice.  Keep rotting in Worcester Hill, man.  You know what the deal is.  And let you know how your coworkers feel about you.  To this day, the people around him know that he's a joke.  Well, let's just hope you signed a long-term contract in Mantown because you're going nowhere fast. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, they're all just fat bastards.  The Opie and Anthony Pilots.  Entertaining Boston.  And crushing careers.  With Dave Mornings at 6 in Static 4 HD Serial on the Rock of Boston.  104.1 WBCN.  You notice the new attitude up there?  Yes.  That's a new attitude for WBCN.  I'll tell you right now.  Mantown.  Don't you love it?  Yes.  And what's the DJ going to do?  He can't bail out of the BIC because you guys are... 
[01:14:00]  We're talking about the same thing.  Now he's stuck in Mantown.  Yeah.  I'll tell them.  I'll make it even a bigger Mantown.  Yeah.  If he bails on it, then it looks like we got to him.  So he can't bail on it.  And he's got it.  But how do you make it sound cool?  I'll tell you how.  He's got his Mantown calendar, babes.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  We heard about that whole bit, too.  Like, they hold these auditions for girls.  Oh, we're getting all the paraphernalia.  It's being sent to us.  We should have it later today.  Yeah, they're supposed to be...  All the Mantown crap that they give to their listeners. 
[01:14:30]  This calendar that they put together where they get these babes that are supposedly like  regular girls, but they're all ringers.  It's like...  Strippers?  Yeah.  People, they're all like strippers and ringers and stuff that, you know, go on.  I don't know what the arrangement is, but I'm sure it's just not a phone call saying,  I want to be on your calendar.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bob, we've seen some of the Worcester girls.  They were regular girls up until they were seven, until their uncle walked in the room.  And then their path was...  Mantown.  L.B., could you get me another bikini teeny, please, here in Mantown? 
[01:15:00]  Did he talk about that?  Yeah.  Ew.  Greg Hill in Mantown.  Another installment of Mantown coming up.  Could you please remove your pants before you enter the Mantown room?  Who enjoys that in the morning?  Apparently, everybody that enjoys Mantown and being gay.  Hey, this just in from Snapman.  WBCN keeps pushing, pushing, pushing, just like the people in Mantown. 
[01:15:30]  Ah.  Is there a dress code?  Oh, well, you can only...  You can wear an ass-scot on.  No, you can wear ass-less anything.  They just hired Charles Nelson Reilly to do mid-days.  Oh, ho, ho, Mantown.  Oh, ho, ho.  I'll be there in a second.  Oh, ho, ho.  Don't forget my bikini teeny.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Mantown.  All the coins have Paul Lind on them?  You have Paul Linds on the hundred. 
[01:16:00]  It's like the big cash denomination.  I'm on the ten.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, Mantown.  If your name is the something man, you're a beggar jizz.  The hill man.  Yeah, right.  Are you?  Yeah.  Stupid.  He never went anywhere in his radio career.  It's all about Worcester, man.  Look, we love Boston.  We love being up there and stuff.  But the reality is when you work at a station in Worcester, 
[01:16:30]  that's one of those stop-off joints.  Yeah.  You stop off, you do your time, and I did our time,  and it's some of the greatest memories of our radio careers.  Absolutely.  Wanting point.  But we wanted to move on from there  because you just want bigger and better things for your radio career.  He's been there for 17 years, just rotting away.  He was the morning guy before you guys got there.  He's been there forever.  I bet you when he first got to Worcester,  I think he's a local guy or whatever,  he was probably figuring out I'll do two, three years here. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  You're still there.  Move on to the big market.  Man, you're still there.  Do you think he's ever going to move on to a bigger market?  No, it's over.  No, there's some radio guys that just get into those markets,  and that's it.  They just never leave.  Yeah, but the whole time you're hoping you're going to get that big call.  Yeah, but...  Every radio guy's hoping to get that big call.  Yeah.  And this is his phone.  Hello?  Hello?  Nothing.  Hi, this is the Hill Man. 
[01:17:30]  I'm not here right now.  I'm in Mantown, but if you have a offer for another city,  you can leave a message at the beep.  Dude, why did he talk that way?  That's bugging me.  I don't know.  It's just the way he's always talked.  That's his cadence.  It's awful.  It's very annoying to listen to.  It's like all the accents are in the wrong...  Ew.  And Hill Man, stop telling your listeners that we kissed your ass when we were there. 
[01:18:00]  That did not happen.  Stop lying.  Kissed your ass?  So there's a guy named Tim here in New York City.  He put together his own Mantown promo.  Yeah.  Tim is great.  He works behind the scenes here at Free FM in New York.  What?  Oh, different Tim.  Yeah, the Tim that's running around as soon as we get here.  This is what he put together for Mantown.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Are you tired of the way your father is rearing you?  Come to Mantown.  Where getting the shaft is a good thing.  Maybe when I get home from work, I'm leaving the wife and the kids and I'm going straight 
[01:18:30]  to Mantown.  Mantown.  Where the weather is always wonderful.  And if you think it's nice out, you can leave it out in Mantown.  I saved money when I went to Mantown.  The only tip I gave anybody was still attached to my body.  I went to Mantown seven years ago on one week's vacation.  I still haven't left.  It's one of the best places in the world for me.  It's where I can be me.  You won't want to leave your friends behind when you come to Mantown.  Hey! 
[01:19:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  And he's just got to keep going with it.  That's right.  It's the lamest thing.  And he's stuck.  Now the whole country is laughing at you, stupid.  Right about now, he's like, oh, no.  Oh, it's Mantown.  This was my big idea.  Is there a way we can maybe change the name, guys?  I can see a meeting.  Okay.  Mantown is done.  It wouldn't be good to continue the Mantown.  But maybe a new name could help. 
[01:19:30]  Anyone?  Suggestions?  Anyone?  Maybe the phone.  Is there someone on the phone here that could maybe help me out?  Opie?  Phone?  Anyone?  Thank you.  He talks like he's deaf.  He talks like he's deaf with ice cream ears at the same time.  I could have saved you, too.  I'm sorry.  Ah, sorry.  A closet full of bumper stickers and Frisbees.  With Mantown all over them.  That's a Mantown.  Okay.  Just a big dumpster behind the radio station full of Mantown stuff. 
[01:20:00]  Shirts and hats.  And there's a guy behind a dumpster still acting out Mantown.  Did you just say Mantown?  Oh, of course he did.  That was good, though.  Oh, God.  Hey, I was just talking about Dave Wellington.  He's the PD up there at WBCN.  And I'm telling you, this guy just gets it.  We've got to start getting him on the show, as a matter of fact.  He's very aggressive.  This is his actual voicemail if you call BCN and you don't get him on the phone.  They've got this guy, Dave Wellington, who's running the station up there. 
[01:20:30]  Hi, you've reached the office of Dave Wellington.  The guy gets the Opie and Anthony show.  Program director at WBCN.  And he's motivated.  Home of the Opie and Anthony show in the morning.  And he loves when we make fun of Mantown.  And touch her in rich in the afternoon.  And our old station up there.  To leave a message, wait for the tone.  And remember, your comments or suggestions may be used on the air at WBCN.  Thanks for calling, and thanks for listening.  That's what you get.  That's great.  That's his voicemail.  This Dave's a good boy.  We love aggressive radio stations. 
[01:21:00]  Yep.  And people that work at them.  YSP is another one down there in Philly.  They're animals.  Unbelievable.  They're animals.  Absolutely.  We haven't pre-listened to these.  You want to just give it a shot?  I say what the heck, Opie.  All right.  We got Mantown.  I get a little salty.  The first batch of Mantown promos coming in from the listeners.  We're a very interactive radio show if you're just getting to know us.  Our listeners are very, very important to us.  And we don't just say it on the air like other shows.  We get so much material from our listeners on a daily basis. 
[01:21:30]  The official animal of Mantown is the mule.  That's what a lot of people are saying.  How about the ass?  I'm sure that's a popular one.  That too.  The blowfish?  Oh, it could be the blowfish also, right?  That is an animal.  The hummingbird?  I think the swallow is the official bird.  The swallow could be the official bird.  I can't believe I've got to help you out today.  Everyone knows you can't go in through the front door in any of the buildings in Mantown. 
[01:22:00]  The entrance is always around the rear.  Oh, they got an ordinance in town.  Yes, you got to park in the rear at all the establishments.  Yes, Anthony.  All right, here's the Mantown promos.  They don't even pave.  They refuse to pave.  They're saving taxpayer dollars.  It's all dirt roads.  So you got to drive up the old dirt road to even get to Mantown.  And get wherever you have to go.  Guys.  That's great.  A little message to the Hillman.  Please don't make it this easy.  Mantown? 
[01:22:30]  Please don't make it this easy.  And it's like now you have to still pitch it with the same enthusiasm.  That's right.  Everyone in the country is calling us faggots.  We want you to go there in your sheds.  Why am I doing an impression of you doing him?  I don't know what he sounds like.  That's not bad, though.  I don't know.  I think a little more.  And you'll have it down in no time.  You have to put the voice inflection.  Right.  Just like that in Mantown.  Here we go, Kathy.  It's like Hal, the computer.  Kathy in Boston, go.  Hey, Mantown has this promotion.  You can win a traveling road show from Mantown. 
[01:23:00]  They'll come to your house.  They'll bring you barbecue.  And they'll bring you a garage band.  And it's really bad.  They'll turn your house into Mantown?  Great.  That's wonderful.  That's really fantastic.  Watch your guys' leather chaps hanging party favors.  Yeah.  I think they were the Frisbees.  Oh, very good.  Thank you, Kathy.  Is that true that maybe they do have some kind of deal with a chocolate company?  Because it seems the Hershey Highway is running right through the middle of Mantown. 
[01:23:30]  So they probably have a deal with the Hershey Chocolate Company, adopt a road program or something.  So, hey, congrats.  Don't dump out of this one, Al, because this is real.  There are liquor stores up in that area called Bunghole Liquors.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know that.  Look it up.  I swear to God.  Don't dump out of that.  It's just a...  Bunghole Liquors.  That's an outlet on a big cask that they put the tap in, is what it's called, technically.  Look it up in the dictionary.  All right.  Let's go to Rob in Boston.  Rob. 
[01:24:00]  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  They have this thing.  It is, uh...  They came up on it on their own.  It's called Free NP.  What is it called?  Free NP.  And the NP stands for nipples.  So it's like, yo, wow.  Free NP?  I just don't get it.  You don't get it?  No.  Why Free M-P?  N-P.  No, Nancy.  Yeah.  Wow, that's just like having a Whip-Em-Out Wednesdays. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  You don't even know what it means when you see it on the highway.  I know.  You asses.  Free, nigga, please.  Free, nigga, please.  This guy is just bombing.  I know.  Bombing horribly.  I don't even know.  I gotta tell you, though, the callers have been doing a good job because I haven't noticed  a bomb call in a while.  How could I be in two places at one point?  How could you be on the phone, Rich, and sitting in front of them?  I don't know how many dumps that guy got, so I don't even know what you heard, but basically  they have a Whip-Em-Out Wednesday promotion.  That makes no sense. 
[01:25:00]  Free N-P.  You gotta figure out what N-P means.  I'm gonna help out Mantown a little bit.  They're classified ads.  They need more help down at the fudge plant in the packing department, it seems to me.  So anybody who wants to...  That old gag.  That old gag.  You know what's funny?  If Kate Beckinsale said to Norton, let's go up to Mantow, he'd be...  Mantow?  Mantow.  I don't know what Mantow is.  Back on the couch!  Back on the couch!  Speak, Rich!  Mantime and Mantow.  Mantow.  How about Mandowns? 
[01:25:30]  Because that's what you have.  Back to the penalty box.  You wouldn't know it listening to today's program, but Rich Voss is a very funny man, and he's  gonna be at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  How he gets through an act where he can speak...  Mantow.  He said Mantell that time.  Mantell.  Mantell.  Mantell.  Coaching Mantell Williams.  Can we have Rich Voss in here every day?  Because it makes me sound so much smarter with my speaking. 
[01:26:00]  All right, here we go.  Some of the celebrities that have chosen to move to Mantown?  Yeah.  Dick Butkus.  Now lives in Mantown.  So you might see him roaming the streets of Mantown.  I'd like to invite our celebrity guest, Dick Butkus, into Mantown.  All right.  That's great.  You want to listen to some of the promos that the listeners came up with?  Mantown promos coming in the first batch.  We haven't even heard these yet, so they might be horrific.  They might be very good. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, I'm sure they're gems.  We're too lazy to listen before the show, so we do it on the air.  Yes.  Here we go.  The first one from Lev.  Where do people turn when they have lost everything?  You want to explain the Mantown concept?  Well, where do they turn when they're in despair?  I don't think I really completely understand it.  Mantown.  Mantown.  Where it's never mayo in your beard.  Where guys can go and just be guys.  More importantly, or just extremely gay. 
[01:27:00]  Mantown, where no one sleeps on their back.  Gay Broadway musical.  Mantown.  Oh, Mantown.  Mantown.  I want to go home.  Sweet, sweet home.  Mantown.  Woo!  That was good.  That wasn't bad, right?  Yeah.  Let's get it right to this.  And old NASCAR driver Dick Trickle also lives in Mantown.  But for some reason, I don't even get this.  There's somebody that they cannot find in any phone book in Mantown. 
[01:27:30]  Michael Hunt.  Sometimes he goes by.  Well, the whole Hunt family has moved out of Mantown.  Seems to have moved.  Mikey Jr., all of them, gone.  They were chased out angrily.  Pitchforks and torches.  Bad, bad, bad.  Yeah, they had a running feud with the gay family.  And the gays won.  They stay in Mantown.  Mantown. 
[01:28:00]  All right, here's the next Mantown promo from DJ New Style.  Get your butt out of that bed and get back to work.  You and Bruce have been gone for over an hour.  No judgment.  No T-cells.  Mantown.  And the homo's, they touch it.  Yeah.  That one wouldn't have gotten played if we screened it.  No.  Sorry, DJ New Style.  DJ New Style. 
[01:28:30]  No.  Let's go to Sniper.  It was bad.  Let's do Mantown.  This is Sniper's Mantown promo.  Coming up on the next Mantown.  Hillman reacts to this month's Arbitron ratings.  Will the Hillman buckle under the pressure?  Find out on the next Mantown.  On the only station that really rocks. 
[01:29:00]  That's good.  That's static.  God, you've got to explain that for the rest of America.  They have a really bad signal.  Yeah, you can't hear it in Boston.  That's funny.  Some just go out in the middle of your, you know, your Metallica song.  Actually, I hear they're not even playing the really hard stuff anymore.  No?  No, not like when we were there.  And finally, we got the last one for today from Shane, his Mantown promo.  My God, I like Kelly. 
[01:29:30]  Welcome to Mantown.  That's the way you can get away from all the girls and hang out with the guests.  I love...  Wait, Opie, what are you doing?  Oh, that wasn't very good either.  Wow, we had two good ones.  And two less than stellar ones.  Two that stunk.  I guess there's only one thing we could do now.  What's that?  We gotta take a break.  Damn it.  There's no energy left in this program at this moment. 
[01:30:00]  By the way, I have some energy.  Yes.  Yeah?  Well, I don't know.  Now Lorraine Bracco can offer Tony a glass of wine because she's following in Francis Ford Coppola's footsteps.  No.  She has launched Bracco Wines with eight selections from hand-picked vineyards.  Lorraine Bracco has Bracco Wines.  Yeah.  She wines in every movie she's in.  Apparently, if you drink it, you're drunk driving to the wall of an acting class.  More on that in just a bit. 
[01:30:30]  We gotta take a break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Call the O.V. and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  That's 866-313-FREE.  The phone lines are going berserk.

[01:31:00]  Rich Voss in the house today.  He's part of our O.V. and Anthony Traveling Virus comedy event.  Comedy tour of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  Are you excited, Rich?  I'm telling you, this is not a lie.  In comedy, and even though it has this, you have dreams, like certain dreams you want to do in comedy.  And one of my dreams was always to work at the Garden State Art Center, PNC Art Center.  It's like a dream come true. 
[01:31:30]  I saw Carlin there, Rickles.  It's going to be great.  This is going to be unbelievable.  The message boards are talking about this like crazy, and they're going to be tailgating.  We're putting together an O&A village, and we're looking for the ultimate wet t-shirt contest.  That I think we're actually going to do on the stage between some of the comics.  We're going to have a dunking booth and other things we're going to be adding as the weeks go on here.  What you need to know, if you're in these three areas, get your tickets now through Ticketmaster Locations.  August 5th, Worcester Centrum in Boston.  August 26th, the PNC Bank Art Center in Jersey. 
[01:32:00]  And September 9th, the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  That's across the river in Philly there.  Tickets on sale now through Ticketmaster Locations.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  And basically, it's all the comedians you know and love from this show.  There's 8 to 10 comics on each show.  And we might even add some more comics as we go.  We got Saget for all three, I think.  I know, Voss, you're on all three.  I'm on all three.  Patrice O'Neill, Billy Burr, stupid Bob Kelly.  We got Carlos Mencia for Jersey. 
[01:32:30]  Dom Herrera for Philly.  We got great comics.  But Dom Herrera is so funny.  He hates your guts.  That's okay.  He's doing the Philly show.  Tracy Morgan.  Funny.  Yeah, Dom's great.  Go to our website for all the lineups.  Or you can go to Ticketmaster to get your tickets and check out the lineups for your area, okay?  Right.  And we're very, very excited about that.  We should play the food story.  This is unbelievable.  This is probably the biggest story in New York today.  Is it?  I really meant that, too.  That and...  Like what? 
[01:33:00]  Bloomberg looking for more money for anti-terrorism and going down to Washington to have to beg for it?  That wasn't a big story?  Nah.  That's not important?  Nah.  The food story, huh?  It's all about the fast food.  The food story.  The food story, it's pretty funny, though.  We could have more fun with the food story.  Of course we could.  Let's be honest with each other here.  Oh, and by the way, Dr. Ian Smith is not gay.  Oh.  He's on the front page jogging behind Michael Strahan.  And where are they jogging? 
[01:33:30]  In the West Village.  The West Village.  The West Village isn't that bad.  Anymore.  It's all about Chelsea if you're...  Yeah, well, no.  Let me tell you something.  It's not all about Chelsea.  Dude, the West Village is where all the celebrities are moving to and all that.  Yeah, exactly.  Like I said.  It's a whole different neighborhood than back in the day.  Back in the day.  When you used to get out of your house and actually explore New York.  I hope you just turned your mic off, Rich.  That's his brother.  Huh?  That's Dr. Smith's brother.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Oh.  Do you mean it in the figuratively or literal sense of the word? 
[01:34:00]  They've never met, but we all know the bond they share.  Oh, wow.  The whole time I'm thinking it's Dr. Ian Smith.  Which actually makes the case stronger that they're not gay because the guy, Strahan, is obviously friends with his family.  So what's the problem?  And the stupid wife now is coming out going, well, no.  Either that or he is really a sick, sick homosexual.  I'm not available.  Then send your brother.  Yeah.  She saw all that money just flying out the window.  So she didn't deny it. 
[01:34:30]  She didn't deny it, but she...  But she's backing off on her.  She's backing off on her claim.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yes.  So, all right.  So that's big news, too, because we had Dr. Ian Smith in here yesterday, and we had a lot of fun with him.  It made all the papers.  I guess the New Jersey Ledger and the Daily News and some other places.  But it didn't make the Post, did it?  No, no.  The Post hates us.  And we hate them.  The Post hates us.  We recently got really good news as far as the ratings go for the New York show here.  And the Post just made believe it's not even happening. 
[01:35:00]  Maybe they had the information, but they drunk drove and got pulled over and said,  Yeah.  Oh, how's that happen?  I've got some gossip out the window.  I hope you lose your license.  Stupid.  That has happened.  The Daily News gave us a headline and gave us a nice picture in their paper.  The Post, nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Cares.  They suck.  And, yeah, they didn't, they didn't, what?  They didn't what?  They didn't what?  They didn't what?  They didn't, they didn't credit.  Yeah, they didn't print or credit us for the Dr. Ian Smith big exclusive interview yesterday. 
[01:35:30]  Why would they?  Why would they?  They waited for him to go on another radio show, and then they gave her all the credit.  That's fine.  It's a rag.  What do you expect?  All right, here's the food story, Anthony.  The story of the day, in my humble opinion.  Local McDonald's could be McZoned right out of the neighborhood.  Let me get over that laugh.  McZoned.  McZoned.  Oh, that's great.  She's McTalented.  Why don't you McDie?  Local McDonald's could be McZoned right out of the neighborhood. 
[01:36:00]  Bronx City Councilman Joel Rivera is proposing an overhaul of the city's zoning rules in order  to limit the number of fast food restaurants in neighborhoods where obesity is epidemic  among you.  Well, that's what he's worried about in the Bronx fast food restaurants?  You idiot.  How about the fact that every corner you go on, they're dealing dope?  Why is that not a problem?  Selling drugs.  Yeah.  And like Morton Steakhouse is opening in the Bronx.  Okay?  True.  Why don't you worry about the McGuns?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Some of the McWeapons going around the school.  There's a lot of McWeapons and McCrack dealers.  Well, how about the McNuggets under the dress of the young lady I'm trying to pick up?  LOL.  A little McDonald's pun.  I get you, Daddy.  What a waste of time.  Yeah.  So they want to eliminate the McDonald's in the fast food places from where fat people  are?  Yeah.  Is that what I'm getting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do they...  How about zoning it differently?  So if you're over this much weight, you can't live in the neighborhood. 
[01:37:00]  How great would that be?  That'd work.  You can't have McDonald's because you can't stop shoveling it into your fat face?  That's not right.  How about if you're over a certain weight?  We get to hunt you.  Ooh.  We get to hunt you.  Wow.  That's fun.  That'll keep everyone's weight down.  That would keep everyone slim and slender.  Imagine everybody just going, there's one.  There's one.  By law, we can shoot you with arrows and you have to walk around with Dumbo ears in the  neighborhood.  A hat with Dumbo ears.  We get to tag you.  We get to...  Trank you and tag you.  That's right. 
[01:37:30]  And then let's track your eating habits.  That's right.  Who was doing this, by the way?  I wasn't listening closely.  Some consummate douche from the Bronx.  ...owning rules in order to limit the number of fast food restaurants in neighborhoods  where obesity is epidemic among youths.  It would also keep them from opening their doors near schools.  Rivera, the health committee chairman, says more people...  Again.  Schools are the worst culprits.  They do stories on what they're serving in the cafeterias of these schools all the time.  Horrible food. 
[01:38:00]  Absolutely horrible food.  Again, though, the government...  And then they get the big corporations to get the contract for the schools and so, you  know, you get your sodas and your candy and everything else.  Again, though, we got to get the government involved because we can't do it ourselves.  So the government has to get involved now because people don't have self-control.  Why do they have to get involved in everything we do under this guise of helping us and keeping us safe and healthy?  If these idiots can't realize in this day and age, in this day and age, that weighing 300 pounds isn't healthy and maybe you shouldn't eat at these places, oh, well, sorry. 
[01:38:30]  And it seems like the fatter women in the Bronx are, the more kids they have, somebody is banging them.  It's not like they're lonely.  Isn't that amazing?  It's unfathomable.  Those guys uptown there, oof, what the hell's going on?  They love their big women.  Their doors near schools.  Rivera, the health committee chairman, says more people die from obesity-related issues than smoking cigarettes. 
[01:39:00]  But some New Yorkers don't like the idea of anybody telling them what to eat and where.  Education is the key.  Information.  If I'm informed about the food that comes out of fast food restaurants, about, you know, what to eat and what not to eat, then I'm more compelled to eat healthy food.  They can't tell us anything.  Only your parents can tell you.  And the kids have to listen to their parents.  If they don't, then they're going to stay fat.  Hey, Rivera points out that in the city, 21% of kindergarten students are already fat and 53% of adults are overweight. 
[01:39:30]  That's because they're running out of the schools, going to the restaurants right next door to the school.  Yeah, right next door in kindergarten.  Excuse me, I'm going to take a little time off from finger painting and I'm going to run over and grab a bite over here at McDonald's.  It's the Bronx and they fry everything.  That could be the problem.  There's no healthy food in the Bronx.  It's all rice and fattening fried food.  What other restaurants are going to work there, too?  It's fast food.  You don't have to tip there. 
[01:40:00]  So that's where they're going to go.  There are just things.  This pops up all the time when either the obesity issue with the food or the liquor stores being placed in the neighborhoods and stuff.  And people always react and say it's, you know, it's got to be stopped.  The government's got to stop it.  It's, you know, a grand scheme, a grand plan.  And just, you know, you're informed enough to know.  Use self-control.  What kind of education do people have to have to know that you can't eat an entire bucket of Kentucky fried chicken and think it's going to be healthy? 
[01:40:30]  You are informed.  You just have no self-control is what it is.  Let people just make their own decisions.  If they want to be fat, then let them be fat.  Let them be fat.  What's next?  Let's go after the butter and the mayonnaise companies.  You know, it's where they draw the line.  Enough money.  Where?  It's a slippery slope of lard.  Yes, Rich?  You know, you've got to take control. 
[01:41:00]  Speaking of self-control.  Well, you've got to take control sometimes in your own life.  You guys got on my case, and it's not even about that.  I said I'm going to quit smoking.  I gave it a date.  I even did it a week before.  It's been almost four days now.  And listen to me.  I don't want to quit.  No.  I stopped drugs.  I wanted to stop.  All right?  I don't want to quit.  I don't clap, please, in a month.  All right.  You're right.  You guys, hey, you've got to start.  Yeah, Rich Voss. 
[01:41:30]  Four whole days.  Wow.  Okay.  That's a lot for Voss.  Voss is a disgustingly heavy smoker.  He walked in.  He's like, it's killing me.  I'm going nuts.  Right?  Yeah, because here's the thing.  You know, when you stop drinking and doing drugs, you want it to.  You hit a bottom.  You know, you want to.  But you don't want to stop smoking.  You just know you have to.  Yeah.  That's the way it is.  I mean, it doesn't really matter.  There's no day that.  I used to wait for the day where I'd wake up and just miraculously not want a cigarette.  Well, it didn't happen.  So I had to just go, you know what?  Enough.  You smoked enough. 
[01:42:00]  So how are you doing it, Rich?  You had yourself enough.  How are you doing it?  How are you doing it?  With the patch?  Explain the patch.  Explain the patch that you got, I mean.  Everyone knows the patch.  The patch is, I did it for, it was, I didn't say it.  No, everyone understands the nicotine patch.  I want him to explain the patch he got.  It's a big yellow star of David.  It really is.  It looks like you're covering a tattoo in the military.  Norton, these are the ones you gave me last year.  Last year?  So here's the key.  What?  Your patches are over a year old. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God.  They expire.  You're making money.  They make fun of me for not spending.  They're sealed.  How can they expire?  They do.  They do.  They got, you know, a date on them.  I'm not allowed to wear these by a school up in the Bronx, though.  Do they really expire?  Yeah, I think they do.  I'm sure there's a date on there.  I'm sure whatever active ingredients are there break down over time, just like anything  else.  I don't have the box, because when I opened it when I was going to quit smoking last time,  I threw the box out, but I don't have the box, so I didn't know if it exists.  So how do you know about instructions and how long you're supposed to? 
[01:43:00]  I don't know, and I just open it and put it on.  You don't know how long you're supposed to put it on for, each one?  Yeah, a day.  A day?  Yeah, I guess.  Less of a day?  You wear them overnight?  I was, but I heard not to do it.  You have bad dreams?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you do.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Yeah, so.  Oh, that's kind of cool, though.  So now, but like in the middle of the night, I would wake up for a cigarette, so now I'll  just keep a piece of like nicotine gum by my bed or something if I wake up.  It's called nicotine. 
[01:43:30]  He didn't just say that, did he?  What?  Did you just say that?  What?  Nicotine gum?  What's it called?  Well, way to go.  Second try at it.  What did I say?  Oh, we heard you.  We heard you, and I don't know if it made the air.  Of course it did.  It probably did.  I hope it did.  Well, it wasn't just to show how dumb you are.  Because it was Rich Voss just screwing up.  Well.  And is it helping?  Do you know?  It's helping, because when I'm on the movie set all day, you know, you're sitting around.  On the set. 
[01:44:00]  On the set.  What movie are you doing?  I'm working on Chris Rock's movie.  Do me a favor.  Let's just say exactly what you're doing.  Don't act like you're acting in the film.  You're one step above craft services.  You know, I'm one of the consultants.  And just a friend.  He's punching up the script.  A little.  It's a good gig.  And you got to meet Steve Buscemi?  Steve Buscemi and some other actor there.  How was Steve Buscemi?  Pretty cool.  He's the nicest guy.  Yeah, nice guy.  You just watch him.  He's like regular, you know, right in the character.  Boom.  He just.  It's called acting, Rich. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people actually are good at it.  Please.  I play Lenny Bruce.  Oh, stop.  Yeah, we know.  You didn't look like him, Rich.  Or sound like him.  Who, Lenny Bruce?  Yeah.  Yes, I did.  I didn't.  Listen to me.  No.  I was Lenny Bruce.  I studied Dustin Hoffman playing Lenny Bruce, and I was good.  You were good in White Chicks.  I happen to be a very good actor.  If you don't believe me, you can just turn on Homebox Office.  That's right.  Right.  I heard great things.  By the way.  You haven't even watched it?  I don't have HBO.  What am I supposed to do? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, jeez.  Why don't you have HBO?  Who doesn't have HBO?  How Jewish are you?  Well, I don't have Curly.  Your nicotine patches are a year old.  You don't have HBO?  I have TiVo.  You are almost a big star.  I know.  I'm going to get it.  TiVo only records things.  You need stuff to record.  I didn't realize that you need.  I thought it recorded.  What did you think?  It was like getting free cable?  Yeah.  I didn't know it didn't.  I just got TiVo.  It comes with all the programs on DVD already there for you to watch at your leisure.  First of all.  Stupid Irish.  What a cheapo. 
[01:45:30]  You are my best friend and you haven't watched my show.  First of all, Stinkpot.  I got the first episode at home I'm going to watch.  Second of all, when I was on NBC, he wouldn't watch me.  More importantly.  He just pulled a more importantly on you.  Did I really?  Yeah.  That's when you changed the subject.  Oh, did I really?  Yeah.  Of course.  And why I didn't watch you on NBC?  Yeah.  Because I was jealous and I didn't want you to succeed.  I want you to succeed.  You're my best.  I want my friends to.  All right.  Hold on.  We got Joey Vega checking in.  Joey Vega. 
[01:46:00]  Hey.  How are you guys?  Hey.  What's up, man?  What's up, Joey?  Hey.  Let me tell you something about Rich Voss.  Oh.  All right.  I'm working with him on this film.  What happened?  What happened?  I swear.  That was not any of us.  Well, what are the odds a Puerto Rican's phone gets cut off?  I swear to God, the phone's just exploded.  Run out of minutes?  That actually just cut off.  Joey's a...  Joey, we didn't hang up on you.  Call back.  I swear.  He's a comedian and a really good friend of ours.  He's on the set with you, right?  He's on the set.  Yeah.  He's really funny.  They're working on the phones in the dunking booth, so we'll get back to the phones in  a second or two. 
[01:46:30]  All right?  I don't like a call that starts off, let me tell you about Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Because it's not going to be good.  What's it?  Hey.  We'll change subjects.  Well, maybe he's calling back right here.  Hold on a sec.  Joey.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  What happened?  No, that wasn't us.  I swear.  Go ahead.  No, is Mitch there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Rich.  What did you say you do on the set?  I helped punch up the script when I'm not taking a nap. 
[01:47:00]  No.  No, all you do is complain about not smoking.  That's what you do.  I'd rather you go back to smoking.  Please.  Go back to smoking.  Is he miserable on the set that he's not smoking?  He has to tell everybody that he quit.  He's the worst.  Every 10 minutes, he talks about Lenny Bruce.  Ew.  Oh, no.  He was talking to Ed Herman.  Ed Herman, disrespected actor.  Ed Herman's talking about Sir John Gielgud, Sir Olivier, Olivier Newton-John. 
[01:47:30]  Well, Lawrence Olivier Newton-John.  Olivier, Olivier, yeah.  And he has the ability to tell, well, I played Lenny Bruce, you know.  Oh.  The guy looked at him like, you're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  That's not the worst of it.  The worst of it, he says to the guy, weren't you in Animal House?  Oh, no.  The guy gets up.  He walks away.  He walks away.  He never came back and talked to him once.  With mentioning Lenny Bruce, I would be embarrassed for you just like for thinking that. 
[01:48:00]  I would be like, wow, you're a self-centered idiot.  But the fact that you would say that to somebody else when Gielgud's name was mentioned, you  are a fool.  Well, this zero, Joey Vega, was sitting across from Steve Buscemi, right?  Joey Vega was on Sopranos.  That's not him.  And Steve Buscemi directed it.  Buscemi.  Buscemi.  Steve Buscemi.  I corrected it, right?  Wow, do you have a hard time.  After the story, I'll put myself in a penalty box.  Anyhow, so Chris introduces us to Steve without us knowing.  He goes, those are the comics.  So Steve looks at Joey. 
[01:48:30]  Joey's staring at him uncomfortably like you do, people.  And he waves to Joey because it's uncomfortable.  And later on, Joey goes, yeah, he recognized me.  No, he was scared that you were stalking him.  He gave him that weird, you're famous guy look.  Made Steve Buscemi, Buscemi, uncomfortable.  Buscemi.  Steve Buscemi.  Hey, how is James Gandolfimi?  Every day, me and Joey are scared that we're going to get fired.  All we do is go, he's going to fire us.  Of course.  Every day.  And he's funny.  He's going to be on to us any day now. 
[01:49:00]  Joey's got a good eye.  Like, he could see the movie.  He's really good.  His career is just, and he's so funny.  He's up to Ritz tonight in Elizabeth.  He's a funny guy.  But we're scared every day.  We just sit there going, he's going to fire us.  Yeah.  Do you contribute?  I'm just going to play.  I'm going to get fired by association.  That's it.  Yeah, stay away from Rich.  All right, Joey Vega.  Thank you.  See you, man.  Good talking to you.  We're running out of show on the first half of the Opie and Anthony program here.  So we should, like, take a break.  Beforehand, Sam Williams from Boston, not happy with us.  Why?  Why? 
[01:49:30]  How could he not be?  Keep writing your negative feedbacks.  Oh.  And we'll read it.  Damn, I've got to read it.  Wait, what is it?  Sam from Boston, hey, I can't stand listening to your homophobia anymore.  Oh, boy.  Ew.  It is funny how you have moved on to bigger and better things, but all you can do is make  fun of a local radio guy.  Good point, Sam.  He must love the free publicity, good or bad, you are giving him.  That guy really kind of chase.  Wow.  You don't get the whole man-town thing.  We don't need you listening to this show, Sam Williams.  I don't know.  That guy really sliced us pretty good.  Let's move on.  He doesn't really understand radio, I don't think. 
[01:50:00]  Rich Voss in studio today.  A couple things going on with Rich.  He's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  212-757-4100 for tickets.  I've got that number memorized because Greg Charles takes care of us, so I take care of him.  Absolutely.  That's how it works.  I don't need to write the number down for Caroline's anymore.  And we're going to be finishing up the first half of the Opie and Anthony show in about 
[01:50:30]  10 minutes, and then we continue on XM like we do every day.  And we have this walkover that's exclusively on XM and the XM Nation.  And Rich Voss will be doing the Starbucks Comedy Tour today.  The Starbucks Comedy Tour.  We've got to rename it, though, because we're going somewhere else.  It doesn't matter if it still has started.  It's the Starbucks Tour because...  Yeah, it started there.  And I think they're going to want me to come back eventually to Starbucks.  Oh, I'm sure they're going to want you back.  It's gone so well every time.  Yeah, no, we've got to leave Starbucks alone after the last one. 
[01:51:00]  Well, the one around the corner was...  Dude, you're killing all the Starbucks.  But the last one, they got really annoyed, the guy that made us all line up.  If you're not buying something, you've got to leave immediately.  Was that Pick-A-Bagel?  No, Pick-A-Bagel was good, too.  The last Starbucks.  You don't remember?  Oh, okay, that's fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I had to buy something there in order to stay and watch your act.  Well, it's a bagel minimum.  The guy has a coffee mug and he's walking around trying to keep everyone under control.  Maybe, I don't know, maybe because it's when someone is working there and you go, 
[01:51:30]  check him for a bomb.  Maybe that's the problem they have with your performance.  The latest buzzkill is this fat guy that works in this building that stands outside now every day  making sure we're out of the breezeway.  Aborigine?  He makes me sick to my stomach.  We're just trying to have a little fun, but he makes sure that we're way out on the sidewalk.  That guy should be ringing a bell in a white suit and then shooting himself through a pillow.  I hate that little short nothing.  It's like five feet tall.  God forbid we bring some entertainment to the streets of New York City. 
[01:52:00]  Anthony's got a very interesting little thing that he found in the paper.  Well, Opie, all the rage these days, of course, is the cougars.  You know who the cougars are.  They're not – everybody knows what a regular cougar is.  It's the cat, but there's a new term, the cougar.  It's these older women that go out at night to all the clubs.  You know, since we started talking about the cougars and cougar hunting, every time I'm out in a bar now –  You look for the cougars. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, man, they're at every establishment now, and I just sit back and laugh because of all the stuff we've talked about on the show.  It's the older women going out, banging the younger guys.  Younger guys looking to pick them up in the bar, and the guys are like these college guys sometimes or just out of college,  and they go cougar hunting because they say it's easy.  It's an easy target.  An easy target, no commitment.  The lights are off anyway.  And they say that the older women are more experienced and know what they're doing and, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They also look like your old cat. 
[01:53:00]  I mean, when you brought your cat home at first, it was a nice little kitten.  Cute kitten.  You know, fast forward a few years, and the cat can't keep his hair together anymore.  A couple of teeth fell out.  I'm not a hot oldie in Miami.  I was with a hot oldie in Miami.  I think I saw that one.  The whiskers are a little long.  A little too long.  A little long whiskers.  It's got that scowl on its face all the time.  Yeah, when Rich and I went to South Beach, Rich hit on a grandma.  Rich hit on and what, picked up a grandma? 
[01:53:30]  I just made out with her breath.  It was her and her daughter.  What?  Why was her breath horrible?  Maybe because her teeth sit in a jar?  She was stupid.  She was an albino hippie chick.  I swear to God.  She was a grandma, and she was out on the prowl with her daughter.  You might recognize her if you saw Billy Jack.  She was tied to the steaks on the beach.  And we went to one of those Ian Schrager hotels down there, one of those fancy joints down 
[01:54:00]  in South Beach, and they have cabanas poolside, and we're all just hanging out having drinks  in one of the cabanas, right?  And all of a sudden, Rich gets up with the albino hippie grandma, and they go off.  And all of a sudden, what was her daughter's name?  Hiawatha or something?  Some bizarre name we couldn't even pronounce.  Of course, some old hippie woman's kid's name.  So all of a sudden, like, you know, some time has gone by, and this girl is getting nervous  about her mom, so she's like, let's go see what they're doing. 
[01:54:30]  I'm like, yeah, all right.  So we get up out of the cabana, and we go to the cabana next door, and there's Rich in  full make-out session with the freaking albino hippie grandma.  Dude, it's one of the greatest, greatest visuals of my life.  Just say, what the hell?  The good thing about that is if you hook up, whether there's no time of the month or there's  not a problem, because you know she already had a hysterectomy.  Right.  So you don't have to worry. 
[01:55:00]  The only thing you got to make sure is you wipe the denture grip off from the corners  of your mouth after you kiss her.  No, that's a wrinkle.  That's not the spot.  When you're driving, if she nods off, you just have to elbow her to make sure she's not  dead.  She's dead.  So you're going to be doing the Starbucks comedy tour after we leave here, and we love  cougars.  We love talking about them.  Oh, the cougars.  And the older women that are black, they're called, what, the Black Panthers or something  like it?  Really?  What was the name we came up with or someone came up with that we discussed on the show? 
[01:55:30]  I can't remember.  Maybe not the Black Panthers now that I think about it.  Pumas.  Pumas, right?  Might be Pumas.  All right, whatever.  Screw it.  They're all just cougars to me.  I don't know.  But now, of course, people pick up on this whole thing.  And now Faye Dunaway, Jolie Fisher, and Carrie Fisher, her sister, are sharpening their claws.  They're all starring in a new comedy, The Cougar Club.  About a group of older women who have sex with much younger men, according to a flack for 
[01:56:00]  the flick.  Dunaway will portray Edith Birnbaum, the Rolls Royce of cougars.  What a sexy name.  Edith Birnbaum.  Carrie Fisher is Professor Goodbye, while Jolie provides guidance in the art of pleasure in  her role as Lulu.  This could be the worst sounding film I've ever heard. 
[01:56:30]  Also in it is Joni Lauer, China, from WWF.  Who's she?  The male interest?  Yes, she's the guy.  Her new name is China Doll.  The story follows two young men who graduate from college and work at a law firm from hell.  Boring.  The guys start a social club of other young men seeking sex with older women as a means  of stress release. 
[01:57:00]  And I guess that's when they meet the Cougar Club.  I was down in Philly watching Cougars Man dance and they were like doing the butt bang.  Oh, oh, they have to like hit each other's hips during the song, you know, and I was taking  pictures and that was on my digital camera that I lost.  I wanted to like post all the pictures.  Now when I go out, I take pictures of Cougars and stuff and I'm taking pictures of these  women squeeze, you know, they're squeezed into these these jeans that are way too small  for them.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  And they're like hip checking each other to the song with their arms up in the air and  they got their cocktail and I'm just taking pictures of their butts and they they  caught me taking their picture and they they turn around and they start posing for me  like I was really into them.  I'm like, no, trust me, it's it's for something that you don't want to know about for something  completely different.  You know, it's to blame for all this is sex in the city because it it kind of made that  Cougar thing kind of put it in the in the spotlight with what's the name? 
[01:58:00]  Samantha.  Yeah, well, I was with my TV repairman last night made it sound hip to like have sex with  everything that moves in your apartment building and at a bar or anywhere.  She's constantly like picking up guys and making it sound cool.  And it kind of empowered these older women and said like, yeah, I could do that.  Look, they're putting it on TV.  It's not sexy.  It's not hot.  It's just guys looking for an easy one. 
[01:58:30]  It's got these guys looking for an easy one.  It's it's not putting these women in an empowerment situation.  They're not looking at you.  It's the whole lie of it is the older women are so much more experienced, man.  And you get better with age.  Yeah.  But like a fine wine.  Really?  Oh, like a fine wine.  You leave out in 100 degree weather.  Keep the cork in.  It's turned to vinegar.  That's right.  More like grapes.  Just step on you in a vat and jump out. 
[01:59:00]  When you fool around with a girl, do you let her do things with her fingers like probe  different areas of you?  There'll be none of that.  Really?  Rich boss.  No.  There'll be none of that.  Not only do I request that I do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that on X.  Oh, see, that's something that would never make it through.  You're much too graphic.  So say it again.  No, they're dumping out like that.  Don't say it again.  Get back on the couch.  Get on the couch.  Back to the penalty box, making Al Duke's dump out of our show.  We weave.  We'll talk about that stuff on XM.  That's what we do. 
[01:59:30]  We weave the language here on the show.  We know what we can get away with.  And Rich thinks, you know.  We'll talk about that on the other show.  That's why.  He's actually doing a wink as he says something.  Yeah.  No one will catch that.  Wink, wink.  We got the best of both worlds.  We'll talk about that on XM in a little while.  And also on XM today, we got the Spanish HBO of Lucky Louie.  My dialogue.  So we got Jim Norton, the actor that's playing Jim Norton for Spanish HBO.  Do you know who did it?  No.  No, we have no idea.  Hey, we got a few minutes.  You want to do a couple of blown home run calls? 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  Yeah, I love these, man.  Doing the walkover, I want to plug my friend because I'm in love with her, is a porn star.  And Ari Vox is just walking over with us.  And she's dancing tonight at Cityscape at Queens.  I am going Saturday night, so I'm in love.  Hey, we have, yeah, we're going to have a nice walkover today.  We got Rich Vox doing the comedy thing.  And we got Jimmy's friend.  What's her name?  Jimmy invited a porn star for the walk today.  All right, here we go.  The Mets announced that Gary Cohen blowing a home run.  Oh, good.  I hate this big call. 
[02:00:30]  That one's driven to right field and deep.  Going back, Bernie Williams.  Still back.  He leaps.  See ya.  Home run for Burl.  Oh, hit off the top.  Hit off the top of the fence and then came back.  The second base umpire, Tim Walske, out there.  Bernie didn't know where it was.  And the ball had carried him back out onto the field.  Oh, that's Michael Kay.  It is high.  Did I do a...  It is far.  It is a bloop single.  Which one did I just do there?  You said Ed Coleman.  Didn't he say Ed Coleman?  I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  Gary Cohen.  Oh, did you say Coleman?  He said Cohen.  None of us really listed.  No, it's Michael Kay.  Well, these are all screwed up then.  That's fine.  Oh, no.  Well, here's the other.  How did this happen?  We got two anyway.  The next one's even worse.  And we're leading up to something, actually.  So hold on a second here.  And that's where there's been the talk that does Reyes identify the pitch out of the pitcher's hand?  Does he identify a curveball?  LeDuc in a deep left center field.  Back goes Griffey looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it? 
[02:01:30]  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Reyes scores.  LeDuc in a second.  I thought the ball was gone, but apparently not.  That was Gary Cohen.  Yeah.  Okay.  I like that one.  It got mixed up.  It's out of here.  Or is it?  We'll tell you a 10.  It's out of here.  Is it?  Stupid.  Or is it?  Travis brought these to the show today, which are good.  And it reminds us of the best one that we play from time to time.  I don't think we've played this in a couple of years.  Old Bob Murphy.  I don't think we've played this since coming back to radio, actually, a couple of years ago. 
[02:02:00]  I love this one.  My favorite.  This is great.  He's confused.  Listen to this.  He's just confused.  Good old Bob Murphy.  Bob Murphy.  The old Met announcer.  The pitch.  High fly ball.  It's deep to left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Agbayani can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I thought, sure, he was unable to reach it. 
[02:02:30]  It's caught by Agbayani.  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it.  But he caught it against the wall in left center field.  It is so obvious the guy caught the ball because no one was cheering whatsoever.  No, no, there wasn't like a, ha, a cheer.  He just missed that call.  Even if this was an away game, you still get, you know, the cheers if the other team is hitting the home run.  That one, God, is way back.  Agbayani going back, and it's a home run. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, wait.  Oh, he didn't even throw the pitch yet.  Okay.  By mistake.  Yeah, I think at the end there, he couldn't see.  Oh, it was just.  Oh.  I love that call.  Agbayani back.  It's a home run.  It's what?  Foul tip caught by the catcher.  Okay.  A very similar situation.  Oh, wait.  I'm not even at the ballpark yet.  Wait a minute.  I'm driving to the game.  Poor bastard.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Ah, by non.  No, he's gone.  Oh, Bob.  He's dead now.  He's the reason I can't listen to the Mets.  Or is he?  Wait a minute.  No, he's still here making the call.  I thought he had dropped dead, but he's still alive.  I could never listen to the Mets because of him.  No?  He bugged me so much.  That accent, I could not like.  They all kind of have that thing going on.  Remember Ralph Kiner?  Kiner.  Welcome to Kiner's Corner.  Kiner's. 
[02:04:00]  It's that baseball announcer talk thing.  That one, a towering high fly ball deep center field.  And it's caught to end the inning.  We'll be back after this.  Words from Budweiser, the king of beer.  What?  Extra syllables.  Towering high fly ball.  Extra syllables needed.  Yeah.  Extra syllables all the time.  If you're a baseball announcer.  Well, we had a lot of fun.  We got to bail, man.  I want to thank WYSP once again for sending all the food. 
[02:04:30]  Yes.  And we are so full.  Listeners.  And the listeners.  Giving us some numbers.  Yeah.  We're doing very well in Philly so far.  It's early, but we're doing well so far.  Tell your friends.  We appreciate it.  Has anyone heard my Spanish HBO, by the way?  No.  We're going to do that in a few minutes?  No, I mean, does it sound bad?  It's hilarious.  We're going to have a lot of fun with that in a few moments on XM.  We're going to do the walk with Rich Voss in a few minutes, and I guess that's it for  today.  Yeah.  Thank you.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Dope.  Why is the word homophobia thrown around so much?  No one's afraid of homosexuality.  We're just making fun of something.  We love them.  Exactly.  The more of them there are, the better shot I have at hooking up with a chick who's not  400 pounds.  And with that, we'll continue in a bit.  Robe.  Soup.  Tears. 
[02:05:30]  Poodle.  Robert Reed.  And repeat.  And repeat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  So far, so good today.  Outside 3FM in New York City.  Pretty nice day in New York.  It's not too bad.  It's been hotter, right, Ant?  Nice.  It's a little muggy.  I won't complain about the heat. 
[02:06:00]  I love it.  Nice and warm today.  And a little crowd gathered out here.  What's going on?  I got to tell you, I think our porn star is wearing too much clothes.  Where is that?  Hi.  How you doing?  What's up there, Kenny?  How you doing?  Yes.  Hi.  Of course.  From Vegas.  From Vegas.  Yes.  Yes.  A couple years ago.  I remember.  It's good to see you. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you remember me now.  Remember?  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Except me.  Okay, I'm here.  Yeah, now you're here.  What are you doing in New York?  A business or a pleasure?  A little of both.  A little of both?  Yeah, I'm dancing at Cityscapes on Queens.  Very good.  So come on.  Come on.  Come many times.  Nice.  What do you do?  Specialty show?  What do you got?  Donkey?  Anything like that?  Oh, yeah.  You can tell people whatever you want.  But no, I dance, man.  That's been a great show.  If you just want to be entertained and see some hot nakedness. 
[02:07:00]  Jimmy loves you, by the way.  Yeah, I very rarely like.  I really am a fan.  It's really embarrassing to stay in front of her.  But her oral sex in films is legendary.  And I really am.  I would stop seeing other girls and marry her and allow her to continue to do films.  And just drive her and pick her up from gigs.  I really very rarely like something as much.  I have one awards for such a thing.  Yeah, oral?  It's silly.  Yeah, it's silly that they give awards for that stuff.  Any advice for the regular woman out there?  Yeah.  Suck that cock.  Use a hand motion. 
[02:07:30]  Pay attention to the tip.  And stay as wet as possible.  And don't forget to use your tongue.  Jimmy.  She uses...  Take that advice.  Dude, it's all saliva.  It's all saliva.  It's fucking so hot.  Wow.  She got like extra salivary glands.  It's amazing.  When there's something tasty in your mouth, you salivate, right?  Oh, very good.  The best head ever.  You know?  Not that I would watch some, but I mean, I'm just saying I've watched it.  I like a girl that's picked up on what she's good at and went with it. 
[02:08:00]  Would you give Jimmy head?  It's a fair question.  No, no.  Oh, she's licked the top of his head.  No, he means real, uh...  Like, hello?  My mic seems to be gone.  On the top of his head.  Like real oral treats?  Yeah, but not right here.  No, of course not.  Yeah, no, not in public.  On a city street.  Come on now.  I'm not that kind of girl.  No.  We're not kidding, though.  Would you really give him oral treats like at XM?  Because we could do that over there.  We're allowed.  Wow.  That's...  That's...  I'll have to think about that one.  You won an award? 
[02:08:30]  Come on now.  Did you win?  For her best head?  You won awards for a head?  I have.  Yeah?  That's the weirdest thing.  She goes, well, and she holds up a wedding ring.  Yeah.  She's so bizarre to me.  But he's okay with you doing it on film, though, right?  It's been a little while since I've been in front of the camera, so...  Yeah.  I haven't cheated.  Because we have a video camera.  We could just, like, call it a movie.  Call it Jim Panics and Can't Gets a Rod.  Can't Gets a Rod.  What the fuck?  Can't Gets a Rod. 
[02:09:00]  You are a stuttering, muttering ass.  He's very nervous right now, Anthony.  He really loves her.  Yeah, I'm a big fan.  I'm actually going.  I'm actually not doing an early show, so I can go on Saturday to see you in Queens.  I've never canceled a show to go watch somebody dance in my life.  I can't believe he's going to do that.  Ever.  I'm honored.  All right.  We've got to move on.  We've got Rich Voss out here, too.  He's going to do some comedy for us.  We're going to start the walk to XM.  Let's get closer to the antenna, because I think our mics are crackling a little bit.  Maybe the batteries are going or something.  That could be.  Did we check the batteries before today? 
[02:09:30]  There you go.  Hey.  Hi, Pat.  William H. Macy.  How you doing?  Hey, Rich.  You getting a little nervous?  Come over here.  Get out of everyone's way, because these people are just miserable out here.  Good.  Very good.  You know, I look forward to some of these gigs.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  This club, I think, is going to be good, because they're sitting down.  They're not just standing on line.  Right.  I think this might be a...  Captive audience, almost.  I think this might be a good one.  I think after this one, I'm going to leave my card.  I think they're going to want me back.  Rich, why do you have a Bluetooth in?  Oh, because I was just on the phone. 
[02:10:00]  Oh.  No, you left it in there.  He wants to look important.  What a zero.  We all know you so well.  I guarantee he's like, I'm just going to leave the Bluetooth.  Probably doesn't even work.  Just found it on the street, you cheapo.  First of all, you know what?  That's homeless people should wear Bluetooth.  Homeless people?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Homeless people.  They should wear Bluetooth?  Bluetooth.  Bluetooth.  That's why you don't think they're crazy when they're talking to themselves.  You know what I mean?  That's not what I'm going to do at Rue.  You know what? 
[02:10:30]  I'm going to buy you cigarettes.  I want you dead.  Fucking Bluetooth.  He's trying to dress up for the comedy gigs here on the street.  True religion.  $300 jeans.  All right.  Well, we're just about at your comedy club, man.  Yeah.  Here it is.  What are we doing?  Right here.  You want to regroup?  Oh, wow.  I eat lunch here.  Fuck.  Are there going to be people?  I love this place, actually.  Well, this is how it works.  If you're listening for the first time to the on-the-street comedy from Rich Voss, the 
[02:11:00]  Starbucks comedy tour, I guess.  Ben's checking right now to see if there's people in there.  Yeah, we have Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, we've got enough of those people.  Club Soda Kenny bursts into the establishment and introduces Rich Voss, and Rich comes running  in, does some comedy, until it gets really, really uncomfortable, and then we all run  and flee.  What mic am I using?  You can use mine and send one you want.  All right.  I'll share with you, sweetie.  Oh, no.  Kenny gets the mic.  Kenny intros.  How many people are in there, Kenny?  I saw a couple.  Not too many.  Well, we need the whole crowd. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  Everybody, this way.  We're going right in the store.  Right in the store on the left.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Here.  Well, there's like workers.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  How's it going?  Are you the manager?  Yes, I am.  How are you?  Rip.  Rich is going to do a few minutes, okay?  All right.  Oh, my God.  You can stand for a minute.  Good morning, good people of Rule 57.  Coming to the stage, your next comedian, you know him from last comic standing.  Let's give a warm New York welcome to the handsome Rich Voss. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's always been a dream of mine to work here.  It seems like a nice crowd.  It is the widest audience, so let's get the meeting to order.  Excuse me, sir.  Can you turn around?  This is a big show for me, all right?  It's good to see you.  Where do you work?  Right down the street.  Right down the street.  Is that the name of the place?  Right down the street?  All right.  Good to see you.  You're cute.  Don't ever go to prison.  Anyhow, let's start off with a joke. 
[02:12:30]  A guy comes home from playing golf, and he punches his wife in the face.  She said, why'd you do that?  He said, I've been hitting everything fat today.  Come on.  That's a good one.  Listen.  Stop.  I'm not politically correct.  I never was.  Even in elementary school, the teachers would say sit Indian style.  I get a bottle of whiskey and lay on the curb.  Hey, I'm starting to warm them up.  They like me.  I am kind of dumb myself, though.  Here's a little tip.  If you're ever going for a gun permit, and they ask you why you want a gun permit, you 
[02:13:00]  might not want to say, because I'm tired of being a nobody.  We have a Jewish guy over here.  Hey, how you doing, sir?  Ten blocks from the Diamond District.  I'm a Jew.  It's tough being a Jew.  If Moses were to walk two more miles, we'd have all the oil.  That's not bad, is it?  You liked that one, didn't you?  How you guys doing?  What country are you from?  They don't speak English.  What are the odds?  Anyhow, this has been a great gig for me.  Where are you from, ma'am? 
[02:13:30]  No, I like this crowd.  A big closer?  Any Mexicans here?  Oh, my God.  Okay, that one, huh?  Well, anyhow, I've got to wrap this up.  I will be at Boston Comedy Club this weekend.  My name's Jim Norton, if you didn't like me.  You've been a lot of fun.  Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Rich Norton, he only walked two tables of people.  Take care.  Good night.  Wow, Rich. 
[02:14:00]  That's a thing.  That was so uncomfortable.  That was the most uncomfortable.  That's actually less walkouts than normal.  Not only was it so uncomfortable,  I had two people leave half their breakfast and walk on me.  And they walked on the checks.  You were so nervous, too, man.  Well, it's because the owner knew me, the manager.  Oh, my God.  Of course I'm nervous.  They're all staring at me like I just don't.  The manager actually had to give people their money back as they were leaving in anger. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God.  That's how good you were, Rich.  We should do something for them.  What's that?  Fuck them.  I actually eat lunch here all the time.  The food is lovely.  Yeah, it's going to have a nice wad of spit in it next time you come in.  The manager was into it, so it's Route 57 on the corner of 57th Avenue.  Yeah, he had a sense.  The food is great.  I want a great guy.  He's shaking Voss's hand.  Hey, bro.  We just...  Atlantic Grill.  You and your dad.  I'm Joe.  I'm over here now.  How's it going?  I'm over here now.  We all eat here all the time, by the way.  Yeah, you guys.  I always see you guys walking by. 
[02:15:00]  You guys, so please come in.  We're going to be shot.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thanks for having a sense of humor there.  Hey, come in the back.  Look at these dresses.  We're finished.  We're going to have our fucking feet smashed.  Oh, man.  He was so nervous.  So nervous.  How you doing, sir?  Rich was bombing.  Oh, good now.  Oh, he was fucking...  He had a couple of good jokes that kind of start...  See, that's what happens.  He kind of gets the crowd and then completely alienates them with his bad racist Mexican joke.  Do you laugh?  Yeah.  They don't want to hear racial stuff.  It was uncomfortable laughing, though. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, I know.  I think I was laughing because everybody else was mad.  He does wife abuse jokes and racist jokes in a family restaurant.  He really bombed.  That made me very happy.  And you know what he'll do?  He'll spit it and go, I thought I had him okay, but I started...  Shut up.  I had him at the beginning.  The guy that was annoyed at first was laughing.  People were disgusted.  They were like, what the hell is going on?  Yeah, I like the people that have no clue.  I saw one guy right after Kenny's introduction that looked up at his friend he was eating with, like... 
[02:16:00]  And his face said, what the fuck is this shit?  Why are you here?  Like, why are they interrupting our meal here?  By the way, Stalker Patty's along for the walk today.  We haven't talked to her on the radio, really, since she had the big orgasm on our show a couple weeks back.  Completely naked, having an orgasm for the first time.  Are you getting that?  I have Patty right here.  Patty, did you...  The manager just asked me back. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, really?  You got a gig out of it?  Congrats, Rich.  Wow.  What a monster.  You know, I would like to ask Patty, did you have fun on the motorcycle run?  Yes, I did.  I was sore all over, and I went right to sleep as soon as I got home, but I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it.  It was sore all over.  That means an achy box from bouncing over the roadway.  My butt ached.  Oh, it did? 
[02:17:00]  Who fucked you in your ass that your butt ached?  No, it wasn't that good.  No, it was fun.  Wasn't that good?  I enjoyed it.  I really did.  I never rode so far on a motorcycle before, so I wasn't used to it.  Did the vibrating make your coochie feel funny?  No, I didn't notice anything in that area.  You leaned forward on the seat so your clit vibrated?  I had to lean forward so my butt didn't ache, but it was so much fun.  This is the guy that had to have Patty on his butt.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  I saw the pictures.  Pete, Pete, I'm sorry.  It's Pete.  Hey, Fred Gwynn.  All right.  What a cool great eye.  This is Pete.  He's a regular at my brother's restaurant, FH Riley's in Huntington.  Hi, Pete.  I've seen you standing out here before.  I'm here almost every day.  Okay, I thought you were going to hit us with a bat.  Nah.  He's a psychopath.  He doesn't look the type.  What a creep.  He took one for the team.  Yeah, took one for the team.  She was great.  She was great.  We had a good time.  Did she?  Yeah.  Now, I remember last year, I believe, who did you ride with last year?  Keith, the cop.  Keith was so pissed because she would just babble the whole way. 
[02:18:00]  Was she trying to talk to you?  No.  She didn't talk, no.  The whole way?  What?  Hey, look at that.  There's Yopi Anthony.  Isn't that fun to see?  So she wasn't yapping the whole way?  No, she wasn't yapping the whole way.  No.  Because I would just lean back and smack her.  On the way home, she was getting a little stiff more than I would have liked.  We had to stop her.  Where was she holding on to you?  Your hips?  Yeah.  Were you holding on to a real man?  A real motorcycle man?  How did that feel?  Was it good?  Was it like, did it give you a thrill to be holding on to a man on a bike? 
[02:18:30]  It was a thrill to be able to stay on the bike at 80 miles an hour.  80?  Wow.  You know what?  She's got more balls than me.  I didn't know that.  I wouldn't be able to do that.  Did he say?  Oh, my God.  Did he say?  Oh, she has nothing to live for.  Did he say if you get scared, there's a handle around front?  When she threatens to pull her money out of the bank, they say, beat it, cunt.  I didn't know about that handle.  By the way, Patty, you got some snow on the top of the mountain there.  What's going on?  Patty needs a little rinse. 
[02:19:00]  I'm 51 years old.  Hello.  You ever dye your hair?  I do, but I didn't go to the store yet.  I'm going to include the rest of your body with it and just die.  It doesn't mean I'm going to be completely.  Every woman my age has the problem.  The problem.  Have you had that checked out?  You got some kind of growth on the top of your head.  Do you?  Let me say.  I've had it all my life since I was an infant.  What the hell is it?  Well, move your goddamn hand.  The doctors say it's nothing.  I've had it all my life.  What the fuck is that on your head?  I've had it all my life. 
[02:19:30]  Is that when your mother ditched you at the diner?  She left you on the head?  I have no idea.  Maybe it was a babyhood injury.  I don't know.  At the foundling center that you were left at when you were a child?  You have a clit on your head.  Maybe that's why she doesn't enjoy sex.  Your clit is on your head.  She can only come if she's wearing a hat.  There's a Sherpa on that thing.  Oh, stop.  I cover it over with enough hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not working.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  Let's continue. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you, Patty.  You're a lumpy head.  Patty, look.  Would you wear pants like that?  Whatever.  Have you seen the back of a...  What's her name?  I'm sorry.  Anari?  That fucking jeans are dry.  Her jeans are ripped from her asshole all the way up to the middle of her thigh  on the other side and from the bottom of her pocket.  So her ass cheek, her right ass cheek is completely exposed and people passing by are just really 
[02:20:30]  digging it.  Would you wear those, Patty?  Patty, would you wear that?  I don't have the nerve.  I feel funny.  I feel uncomfortable.  Patty just exposes her head knot.  That's wonderful.  Can we please get...  I really want to get Patty on those jeans.  I really want to see you.  Oh, God.  Would you put those jeans on for us?  We did this one other time with a stripper or something where they had the same outfit  on.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It is hilarious.  Yeah.  Patty, would you put those on?  Not out here.  No, not out here.  Duh. 
[02:21:00]  I tried them on, yeah.  Oh, Patty.  You've wasted your youth.  You can't wear jeans like that when you got a copy of a fucking MapQuest on the back of  your leg.  No, that's the beauty of it.  What kind of panties do you have on?  What kind of underpants?  Yeah, what kind of underpants are you wearing?  Bloomers?  Oh, don't be shy.  We've seen it all with you.  Any commando today?  Not the ONA briefs, that donkey's one.  She gets, like, free underwear that she wears.  What are you wearing? 
[02:21:30]  What panties are you wearing?  Look how sexy those are.  They're a leopard print with, like...  But I can't afford those.  And they got, like, little rhinestones in them and matches her bra.  I mean, holy shit.  They're in Victoria's Secrets and in Calvin Klein's, but I don't have...  I can't afford that kind of a store.  I don't make that kind of money.  I'm not going to lie.  I got these on Clarence.  Yeah?  And I can stone them myself.  Ah.  Someone tells me you walk into the store, they just throw them at you.  Please put this on.  Yeah, but they do carry them.  Please advertise for us. 
[02:22:00]  You have them in the spring water.  What?  Patty goes into Victoria's Secrets and Victoria says, get out.  They can't keep that big of a secret.  I'm not big.  No.  Well, you know something?  I was looking at the pictures.  There's one picture posted up on Wack Bag, and you look like E.T.  It's tough.  Your thighs and ass are getting wide, Patty, and you're getting a gut on you. 
[02:22:30]  Are you eating all the Starbucks merchandise?  Because they just had a story about how fattening a lot of the stuff is, and I think you're packing  on some...  I don't need a lot of that stuff.  A lot or any?  I don't need any, practically.  Because you get it.  Where's that gut coming from?  The last thing I ate that was sweet was chocolate pudding, and that was it.  I thought it was a black eye that you met on.  Because I can't eat a lot of stuff.  Can I see one of those slippers?  Patty, wait for the mic there.  Can I see one of those slippers?  Look at those awful shoes she's wearing, too.  Let me see one of those.  Seriously.  You're starting to look like Vic Tabak. 
[02:23:00]  Let me have one.  Let me see one of these.  Let me see, because where did they come from?  Oh, yeah.  You know where that's coming.  Right out into 57.  I want to see...  We got to get Patty in those jeans.  I can't believe she gave it to you.  Why would she?  Look how Jimmy looks.  Look how proud he is.  I'm so happy.  Beautiful girls.  A couple of tourists here.  Hi.  Where are you from, people?  Where are you from?  Oh, Jesus.  Ireland? 
[02:23:30]  Love Ireland.  Want to say hi on the radio in New York?  Look at that fat Irish girl.  Did you see that kid?  Did you see the kid?  He must have been about...  The kid's got to be nine years old.  He looked at your tits like it was the Blarney Stone.  That kid from Ireland loves America.  You have just made a friend of America.  Did you see the fat...  It was hot at the end of the rainbow.  Yes.  Did you see the little fat Augustus Gloop daughter who just fucking hustled up and wrecked it for  the whole family?  Looking for a weenie cart.  She ran away. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, they did.  They hauled ass.  Oh, Patty, don't be sad.  What's the matter, Patty?  It was just a joke.  Yeah, he could have really tossed it in the middle.  He didn't have any...  Are you sad?  No.  It's a lot easier.  I got to say...  I'm not bad at all.  It's a lot easier to do that stuff when I know people are watching.  Yeah, true.  And if I do have something sweet, it takes me about a week to eat it.  Shut up.  All right, already.  Enough with you.  Patty, come up with us.  I want to see you in these jeans.  I think that you're going to look a lot better than you think, and then other people think  you're going to look.  Yeah.  We gave you your first orgasm. 
[02:24:30]  It worked out better than you thought, right?  She's coming up with us.  We got to go because it's starting to rain here and down.  That little trickle.  Oh, my God.  Look at this guy coming down the...  Wow.  He buys it to be a big and tall shop.  Yeah.  God, fuck.  How you doing?  Just one more wafer.  One more wafer.  I really want to see.  I have to put my arm around a bad friend.  There you go.  Look at you.  Can't a man be happy?  For a minute.  You know we'll have to tear you down and knock you down a few pegs where you belong, Jimmy. 
[02:25:00]  I just like the fact that the guys walking by saw me walking one day with Debbie and then  now with her, and they're like, how did this fucking disaster land, chicks?  People are mouthing, it must be a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing.  I swear I just saw someone mouth that.  It's Jimmy's wish.  I'm very happy.  I've been kickboxing lately.  Do you need me to whoop someone's ass for you?  Yeah, mine.  Pick him.  Oh, she just spanked Jimmy. 
[02:25:30]  She can do whatever she wants.  Well, what a fun problem.  Back of the bus.  The third city bus with the Opie and Anthony on it.  Nice.  I like it.  Thank you for your time in New York City.  Fantastic.  They're advertising for us.  Let's go upstairs.  We have a lot of ground to cover here.  Yes, we do.  Hi.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  There they go.  We get a crowd of people that I don't even know what they're all about anymore. 
[02:26:00]  Like old people are out there and fat people.  I'll get a seat.  Oh, I don't like that.  We'll see you in a couple of minutes.  Oh, what's up, man?  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Dopey.  Two guys that hate each other.  Just shut your mouth.  I hate them.  Shut up.  Don't be unkind.  Shut up, bitch.  Oh, very nice.  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  Opie.  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio. 
[02:26:30]  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshats.  And these dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage. 
[02:27:00]  And you're stinky.  You are cordially invited.  Huh?  To a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Rock, press the button. 
[02:27:30]  I need a microphone.  I need a microphone.  Headphone.  Hi.  Jimmy and Opie always duck into the bathroom together for that last little snuggle before 
[02:28:00]  the second part.  O&A Mach 2 XM version.  I got a bladder, a steel bladder.  They call me.  I wear a diaper.  You just wear a diaper.  Take a piss wherever you want.  How handy and convenient would that be if it was acceptable?  Yeah.  To just walk around with a dighty.  Just piss yourself.  Shit yourself.  It's the big deal.  What is the big deal?  Well, eagerly awaited.  That was pretty cool.  That porn star is smoking. 
[02:28:30]  She's pretty hot.  Yeah.  Most of those porn stars are like, eh, enough.  They look too much like porn stars.  She's got kind of a girl next door look to her.  Not bad.  Everything about her is perfect.  Not too shabby.  And she's walking down the street with Jimmy giving him like one of those boyfriend,  girlfriend things where they got their arms around each other like they're a couple.  Hey, what's up, bro?  That annoyed the shit out of me.  What, sweetie?  Jimmy.  What, baby?  The whole way you were walking down the sidewalk with your arm around each other like a new  high school couple going out with each other. 
[02:29:00]  Dude, I really like her.  It was so silly.  I know.  I don't care.  I never get the chance.  It's like, you know.  She's a porn star.  Oh, no.  I love that.  And you're walking around like you just gave her your pin.  But she likes me.  We're going steady, I think.  I just...  Oh, she's got to go to work.  Hull, hull, hull, hull.  I can't tell you the hours I've spent alone looking at a computer screen with her face.  Based on it, just fucking treating myself horribly.  And your hand just moving rapidly.  Very few do it to me like that.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  She's getting cool.  I'll tell you.  Because you know me.  I don't find porn stars attractive.  Usually they just look like bad, you know, weathered strippers and stuff.  She's got a nice girl next door quality.  Yeah, she really does.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  I'm actually going to go see her on, uh...  Why would somebody be calling me when you know I'm on the radio?  Why would you have that ringtone?  Answer the phone, Jimmy.  I have to answer with my head.  It was Kate's whatever assistant.  Yeah, you just hung up on her.  She decided to call you personally. 
[02:30:00]  Why would you call me at 925 when you know I'm on the air?  All right, here's the deal.  Here's the bit.  We're going to get...  What's her name again?  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Inari Vox.  And she's dancing at Cityscape in Queens all weekend.  Wow.  All right.  We have to get a picture of her in those jeans, bending over, and then she's got to let Patty  do the exact same pose.  We did this once with another stripper that came in.  Remember?  It was like some kind of...  It was a white bodysuit.  A white bodysuit, fishnet type thing, and it was just horrific. 
[02:30:30]  Maybe the boys could repost that picture on our re-anthropy.com or on WackBag or something.  It really is amazing.  Because her head was shaved at the time, too.  So it was just very, very funny.  We're done with that.  Where's Patty, Hawk?  Can I have one minute just to explain to the audience I just went up against?  Oh, okay.  It was pure, pure white people, businessmen with their backs turned to me.  I saw fear for the first time.  Because their backs were turned to me.  For the first time, I saw fear in you.  Well, you know why?  You were a little nervous.  I was nervous at that one.  You know why? 
[02:31:00]  Because they're back...  Which is fine.  I'm just...  How can you not be nervous?  Pointing it out.  That's all.  No one's looking at you.  I try to get some jokes out.  I think I got one chuckle going, oh, this is going to be well.  And then it just, you know, ugh.  And the manager knew me, knows my father, you know.  Yeah.  That was cool.  That was the first time the guy in charge was cool, so...  You know what?  You did, though.  I wasn't able to get a good view of the entire place.  Yeah.  But I saw that table that was just as you walked in the door.  Yeah.  To the right, those two guys. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  And they were so annoyed when Kenny first gave the intro.  But you won them over.  So at least that table, you won over.  The guy with the, uh...  I'm hitting everything fat today.  Yeah.  Oh, that was really funny.  The golf joke.  And of course, those two look the type that, like, play golf.  He turned to his friend, he went, that's funny.  Like, he probably goes home and smacks his wife around a little bit, so he found it funny.  You had that table.  But, you know, one table out of the whole place.  Well, here's your thing.  When three tables leave, you really left, because I... 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I gotta admit.  Three tables left.  I was very uncomfortable today.  Dude, he cleared that plate like salmonella.  I rarely get uncomfortable, but I was feeling for you, because they were staring at you like  they wanted to kill you.  I actually went back out on the sidewalk to take a breather.  They really started leaving?  Yeah.  Two foreigners got up.  And here's the thing.  It's supposed to be uncomfortable.  You're doing stand-up comedy in the morning in a diner.  But you understand that people gave up food that they need before work. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Because they hated you so much, they decided, I'd rather be nauseous at work with a coffee  full, coffee stomach.  You ever have, like, an empty stomach with coffee in it?  They opted for, like, hypoglycemia.  It was...  Than to watch the rest of your act.  I was...  It wasn't.  I was kind of nervous.  All right, let's go to Ken in Florida.  Ken.  Hey, boys.  First of all, Jimmy, you fucking rule.  Thank you, sir.  I want to call Voss.  Voss, you got to start writing your own material, man.  You just told a joke about walking two more miles before you have all the oil.  Anthony told that joke about a month ago when he was imitating Muhammad Ali. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I hate to tell you, that joke's on my album from four years ago, stupid.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, you idiot.  Hey, Ken.  What are you selling me out?  I never even used that joke.  That's why it's on Voss' album from four years ago.  Shut your mouth.  It's on an album.  That's all you got?  That's all you...  You take one joke?  First of all, I didn't...  No, I don't care about it.  First of all, the golf joke I did today was a joke joke.  That's all a deal.  I'm not doing Caroline's.  I'm doing a restaurant at 8.30 or 9 in the morning, you idiot. 
[02:33:30]  Are you that dumb?  That's right.  Excuses.  Throw yourself out of a window.  Leave Shecky Voss alone.  Guys, you know, I like to take my cummerbund off and wrap it around your neck.  All right, we got the dumb sheet for today, or are we still watching that?  Yeah, where is it?  It's got to be...  Rich Voss has got to be all over the ass end of that one.  What?  I said one thing.  I said hemorrhoid.  No, twice you said it.  I love when you do that.  See, here's what you did.  You said...  You could say hemorrhoid, right?  Yeah.  You've got to follow us.  Yeah, it was... 
[02:34:00]  You were talking about an asshole.  I know what Dan's going to say.  Yeah.  And it was like...  Do you like when they use digits?  Then you say, you like when they...  Yeah, yeah.  You said, you're sticking a finger up your ass.  Around the back door.  But you were trying to keep it clean for regular radio.  And you said, a girl did it once, and she hit my hemorrhoid.  And I said, you can't say that.  And he said, I can't say hemorrhoid?  It's like, you did it again.  So then they have to talk about again.  It's like shooting someone, and you go, no, you can't shoot that person.  And then shooting them again, I go, I can't do that?  You...  I worded it.  You identify your mistake.  I worded it. 
[02:34:30]  I said, do you like when a girl takes her finger and probes certain areas?  You didn't even need to say that.  You could have just said, do you like when a girl uses a finger?  Like, who wouldn't get that?  Like, nobody thinks you mean for an eye exam.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  Grab wax out of your ear.  You got to let the listeners try to figure some of this stuff out.  And then, because they will.  They know what you're talking about.  And then when you say hemorrhoid, where else is a hemorrhoid going to be?  I'm sitting right across from you.  So they know now that you're talking about an asshole. 
[02:35:00]  It's getting too graphic.  Yes.  And then that's where they have problems.  A little controversy.  Jim in Philly's backing up that last caller.  He absolutely did.  When he was Muhammad Ali.  He was that exact joke.  That might have been a really...  When did Anthony do Muhammad Ali?  Was that a replay?  It must be a real old bit.  It must be an old bit from that.  Then that's five years ago.  And I started at seven.  Wait.  You stole one of Anthony's jokes and put it on a CD?  I want to hear that because I don't know. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  We'll try to find it.  He got Pope Road Seward and Norton pissed himself.  It was hilarious.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  I don't know what you're talking about, sir.  Pope Road Cunch, sir.  Yeah, but see, you know what?  I could easily defend Anthony.  When he did that Muhammad Ali thing, it was Muhammad Ali doing jokes.  Doing punchlines.  Only punchlines.  And you were stealing my...  He was stealing everybody.  On purpose.  He was stealing from everybody.  That was a bit.  He was stealing from Rich, who stole from the Catskills.  Do you have to do that with so much conviction, like you're giving a speech at IBM? 
[02:36:00]  He's acting like he's talking to a whole...  The new head of Microsoft.  I know.  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  What happened?  Where'd our Reuters friend go?  We have Reuters following us around today, and she just quickly got up off her...  Did we say something?  Off her chair and ran out of here.  Reuters goes all over, too.  Uh-oh.  Is everything cool?  Thumbs up?  What happened?  Thumbs up.  Maybe she just has to leave.  Had she seen enough?  I think she wanted to see the walkover and then the transition to XM, so... 
[02:36:30]  Doesn't want to really see the XM material.  She was just waiting for the first person going, oh, okay, I get it now.  Okay, now they come over here and they're potty-mouthed.  Hey, everything okay?  We got a thumbs up.  Karen Mateo saying, thumbs up?  Okay.  But Ben, why did she leave?  Had to go?  No, no.  Ben's saying she has a drinking problem.  Oh, Jesus.  No, she has to go.  And Ben would know.  Just look in a mirror.  All right, what happened?  We thought you were angry at her.  Oh, we thought you got up and left.  Okay.  I know.  I'm fine.  Yeah.  We didn't call and stuff.  We have very much... 
[02:37:00]  Oh, what happened?  Oh, she got a call.  No, I didn't hear you calling.  I really hit the guy's phone, yeah.  Oh, she needs headphones.  Of course she needs headphones.  Why would she have headphones?  Why would she?  Why would she be upset at all?  Why would she?  It's only Reuters.  Oh, no, no.  We think you should have had headphones.  We're bothered that it wasn't given to you.  Of course.  I mean, why would you have them?  I mean...  What?  Okay.  Why would you?  Why would she?  But I don't add anything to the show.  That's not what I meant when I posted that.  Why would you? 
[02:37:30]  We got the dump report.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Wow.  You know, we've got to start cursing more, I think.  You told me to stop cursing.  I start cursing again tomorrow.  Well, we should.  No, no.  I start cursing again tomorrow.  I'm very proud of what we're doing over there.  Me too.  Blading curses by me starting tomorrow.  No. 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  We start at...  We've got to keep both sides happy.  6 a.m.  And here's where we keep them happy.  How?  By cursing here.  I think XM people are very happy when we're doing bits.  I haven't gotten any emails saying, you guys don't curse enough.  There's been material we do over there that is very risque.  Today, it's just a matter of weaving the words properly, unlike Rich Voss.  Wow.  The first dump didn't come until 7.54 a.m.  That's almost two full hours.  And this one never should have been dumped.  This has nothing to do with the FCC. 
[02:38:30]  This is just a panic move by the company.  It's a company thing.  Nigga, please.  Nigga, please.  Two times by the caller that was on the phone.  Nigga, please.  Yeah.  I'm sure they're doing the same thing at all the black stations, dumping out of the same thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Same rules for everyone.  There's no double standard there.  I'm sure on CSI, they dump it out, too.  No double standard there.  Yeah, on TV.  But for some reason, when you do it on radio, everyone takes it so seriously and just blah,  blah, blah.  And then almost an hour later, for the next dump.  Yeah, almost an hour later.  Good. 
[02:39:00]  And it was reference to having hemorrhoids.  Rich Voss said, off mic, after asking if the other guys in the studio like when a woman  probes their body with her fingers, you were fine up until that point.  But when you mentioned hemorrhoids, now probing the body becomes an area that is now blatantly  obvious unless you get a hemorrhoid of the ear, which I think you did have that you used  to scratch and make people sniff.  But here's the thing, and you guys are right on this, but I tried to, you know, I knew  it could be risky, and I tried to go around. 
[02:39:30]  I made, you know, yeah, it was bad.  Shut up.  This is why we love you.  You are probably my best friend.  No, we don't.  Whenever you try to be clever.  What about me?  What about me?  You're more than a friend.  You're closer than a friend.  I keep him at arm's length because of our religious differences.  You're a meal ticket.  Yes, you're a friend, and my friend, and my future.  Voss is dispensable.  Except for all the tapes I have.  There is the friend with the long coattail, and the friend with no coattail. 
[02:40:00]  Voss is fucking wearing a leather vest.  Both guys aren't like those fucking coattails from like 1906.  I'm wearing a big, like, big, nice, long ones.  I don't even have to stand on them.  I can lay on them with my feet stretched out.  I hope he's like a Nosferatu cape.  I'm wearing a slip and slide.  And Voss is in a halter top.  You non-coattail piece of shit.  You couldn't help me.  There's nothing you can do for me.  There's nothing?  Yeah, nothing.  There really isn't.  Nothing. 
[02:40:30]  You had your last comic, you know, standing thing.  First of all.  And we were hoping that it might lead to something for all of us.  We got nothing out of that.  Things are going well.  I'm happy in my career.  I'm so happy for him.  I'm going to take the view with fat chicks.  That's what I got out of your last comic standing days.  Listen, let me tell you something.  First of all, thank God I'm not involved with this season, all right?  But then again, I'm not crippled or retorted.  We gave up.  Yeah, gave up watching it.  Gave up watching it.  Gave up talking about it.  Gave up playing the audio.  It is horrible. 
[02:41:00]  Last comic standing is so bad this season.  It is the worst show on TV.  Hey, is my roast?  I hosted something for them.  A roast.  So I don't know if that's aired yet.  I'm not kidding.  I gave up.  I don't even know.  I'm sure one of the listeners would let us know.  It is horrific.  They just don't get what you need to do with that show.  It's ridiculous.  Is there brutality?  It is awful.  They picked the wrong comics to begin with.  I figure so.  Let me tell you a little something about Rich, though.  Because they had to get the black guy.  They had to get the chick guy.  They had to be cast.  They had to get the reality show. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, they had to get the comic that has some kind of physical problem.  Oh, yeah.  The one with...  Crap.  The one with...  He is funny, by the way.  He's really good.  He should have made it.  So, you know.  But that's not fair.  But they were obviously, you know, typecasting and trying to get people to fill, you know,  roles.  And there's one dude that looks like Gene Wilder, whose name I don't remember.  But he's also really funny.  Yeah, he's funny.  He did one of my lines.  But he's funny.  What was your line that he did, Rich?  I did it on last comic.  I don't know.  What was the line?  You should do.  Stop being...  I don't know.  I used to do the thing about Statue of Liberty. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Wait, but first of all you're going to say, let me tell you something about Rich.  So, it seemed like it was going to be a compliment.  I wanted to say that he is doing something for us.  If you look at his latest...  Is it a DVD?  Yeah.  He's got us right on the front cover.  It says, thanking Opie and Anthony in big letters.  But I saw the ad, the thing that's going to be the cover sheet for this.  It is the hackiest line I've ever read on anything.  Uh-oh.  It says, get rich quick. 
[02:42:30]  And Rich is in red and the other type is in white.  So, it's like, get rich quick.  But he means himself, like, pick this up now.  Get rich quick.  I don't believe...  I don't...  You're lying.  No.  I swear to you.  I didn't...  Get a copy of that for us.  You didn't come up with it, but you had to...  Hold on.  You had to approve it.  Yeah, I did.  But here's what...  Let me correct you.  Let me correct you.  It's my old DVD in a new cover going to the stores.  Because it's never been in the stores.  It's not a new DVD.  Same garbage, different packaging.  Different packaging.  Yes.  Right. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  On the DVD that was completely black.  Yeah.  But it's a good DVD.  I don't care what anybody says.  Yeah.  But here's the thing.  I mean, I'm working on a new one.  Here's the thing.  How about that Achille Lauro, people?  How old is the material?  Hey, I know the shuttle was a big tragedy.  And he's talking about the one in 85.  First of all...  He's complaining about Islam and how they're holding those hostages in Iran.  Hey, what do we get?  Day 200.  Let our people go.  The second track, when I talk about Watergate, kills.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Get rich quick. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  He's going to go find it for us.  Get rich quick.  Why don't we take a break?  And we have audio to play.  Yes, we do.  I'm going to do that.  He's so happy.  Let's do that next.  We got Jimmy in Spanish.  Do we got the...  Okay, we got it.  Great.  All right.  Because we want to match them up.  Jimmy, you know, he's part of Lucky Louie on HBO.  We got his scenes.  We played his scenes yesterday.  And it came to our attention that Spanish HBO is obviously running Lucky Louie.  And they had to find a Spanish actor to overdub Jimmy's lines.  Now, is this the second episode, right?  The one that just aired?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  So do you do the inflections and everything?  That's what I got to hear.  A lunatic, maniacal kind of delivery?  He's probably like a really handsome, chiseled-jawed Spanish dude with an open shirt.  We haven't heard yet, so we'll do that next.  A lot of hair on his chest.  Yeah.  What's going on with the jeans and Patty and all that?  Hawk, have you photographed it?  Behind the scenes, someone's got to take care of all that.  She's got to do a sexy, from-behind pose.  Why would they go with our suggestion?  Yeah.  Why?  Why would everyone do that?  We only said it 30 times.  If we only said it, it's obviously radio gold.  Why would we actually, you know...  Look at Hawk trying to convince her to remove her pants. 
[02:44:30]  Could you...  I take a picture of your ass, and then could you take your pants off and let this thing  put them on?  The bit is obvious.  Hawk, the bit is obvious.  She's got to bend all the way over.  She's got to bend all the way over.  She wants to take the photos in front of you guys.  All right.  Hey, there's no problem there, of course.  Ooh, a smoothie from me.  And delivered with love from Kenny.  Hawk, you have to...  Are you sure you don't want me to taste that and make sure it's not poison?  Oh, no thank you. 
[02:45:00]  I like you and all, but no one can touch anything I consume.  It just can't happen ever.  I was just trying to steal your shit.  Thank you.  Mine!  Oh, see, there it is.  Get rich quick.  See it up there on the air?  Turn it around, please.  That has to go to Wackbag.  Oh, my God.  Send that off to Wackbag because I want them to Photoshop the shit out of that.  The stuff on the DVD is terrific, but that is awful.  And I know the first one's going to be get shit quick. 
[02:45:30]  Why does it have to say rich in red like we wouldn't get it?  We wouldn't get the joke.  His name is Rich Voss.  Rich!  Oh, Rich!  Voss!  Rich money!  Is Rich Voss now doing kind of those tapes where he tells you how to sell real estate?  I don't get it.  But we're right on the cover.  That's nice of you, Rich.  Of course you're my...  Let me see that.  Where's the cover?  Last Comic Standing, Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  And Opie and Anthony, bigger font.  That's right.  Than Last Comic Standing.  New York Comic of the Year Award? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, Backstage Magazine.  Backstage Magazine.  It doesn't matter.  What do people know in the stores?  Backstage Magazine.  New York.  That's the Entertainment Magazine.  Why do you say as voted on by Jessica and Ellen?  Well, you know what else they put out here?  They also put Best DVD, Voss.  Great humor.  Oh, the fucking worst places they can quote from.  Any quote they can kind of legitimize.  This guy's great, Jim Norton.  Backstage Magazine.  New York Comic of the Year. 
[02:46:30]  The Comical.  I can't even get past that.  I can't even get past that.  Backstage Magazine, huh?  That's a big entertainment magazine.  Who'd you beat out?  Larry David and four other gay guys.  Or Jim David.  Not Jim David.  Oh, my God.  You're a wreck.  Please, Larry David, sue him.  Please bring out your fucking...  I want to see that in the favor.  Larry David accused of being gay by a comic-voted Best Comic in New York. 
[02:47:00]  I want him to take that Seinfeld syndication money and dump it into lawyers who just want  nothing but your house and your possessions.  Let's go to Betty in Michigan.  Betty!  Hey, Voss.  Get rich or die crying.  And, sir?  We don't appreciate...  We can make fun of our friends, but we don't like when you say things about them.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got to get pictures of you in your jeans.  You got to be bending over.  Then Patty's going to wear the jeans.  She's going to bend over. 
[02:47:30]  Then we put both pictures up on opiananthony.com, and everyone will laugh and laugh.  Hey, we'll see if the people can tell who's who.  There's a contest.  There's a contest for everybody.  When we get back, it's Jim Norton in Spanish.  That I want to hear.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself, and he's just ugly, and his nose is falling off. 
[02:48:00]  I don't rock it.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual, incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him.  He's not really that smart.  I'm sure I can go fuck himself.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, hey, there we are.  Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  They're taking pictures of Patty in the ripped jeans, and she just looks horrific. 
[02:48:30]  And now just in her thong, in her Opie and Anthony thong that she's wearing.  And I said that she looks like an old-time wrestler.  Yeah.  And Jimmy goes, get a picture of Dusty Rhodes.  Dusty Rhodes.  She's got those.  I put my shorts back on.  There you go.  There it is.  Do you have any underwear, Patty, besides the free Opie and Anthony underwear that we give you?  Yes, I do.  Get a mic in front of you.  Give Geddy Lee a mic.  I'm not Geddy Lee. 
[02:49:00]  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  Yes.  You're looking more and more like Geddy Lee.  You should be singing Free Will.  You really are fucking...  I will choose Free Will.  Living in the limelight.  I'm like the universe of the dream.  What those...  You look like Geddy...  Wow, yeah, because your hair now is really long.  We need a little rush.  And kind of Geddy Lee-like.  Hit me with some rush, man, when you got it. 
[02:49:30]  You got the little chiclet teeth like Geddy?  Look, there are 51-year-old ladies that would envy me.  Yeah, cemeteries are full of them.  Yeah, they're called Lady Di.  I feel bad for her.  I wouldn't make fun of her.  I feel bad for her.  Yeah, whatever.  Charitable.  That's you lovely.  Bring that to another radio show.  Oh, here you go.  Oh, Godspeed.  Well, something happening over there. 
[02:50:00]  That's a little better than what we're looking at.  You want to take a look at a real woman there, Patty?  Look at a Norris bosom.  Jim, natural?  Or natural?  I asked Jim because he knows everything about you.  Yeah, they look very natural.  Patty, what do you think?  Oh, her nipple.  I mean, I'm very small.  I have hardly any.  Right.  Do you...  No, not what do you think about that. 
[02:50:30]  What do you think?  Do you ever get angry at God?  Like, I would just picture you pissed at God all the time.  I'm not.  For fucking you over.  We've said this many times.  It just shows that God has a sense of humor, man.  You get the DNA working one way.  You get this.  You get it working...  It's all the same components.  Yeah, you get it.  It's all the same carbon life form made out of the same stuff.  Hey, I'm going to look for photos of myself from about 25, 30 years ago.  Oh, yeah?  Sure, there's some sexy ones.  I've got to bring them in.  That's great.  I've got to dig them up. 
[02:51:00]  There are photos of you.  I'm not out of the ground, either.  The deck of the Andrea Doria?  No, I didn't look that.  It's just that I'm older, so I'm...  Yeah.  You know.  I think you have a nice...  For an older lady, you have a very...  You have a nice body.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I appreciate that.  It's the truth.  That makes me feel good.  Patty does have a...  The biggest degenerate pervert in the room.  I'm a pervert, but Patty, I mean, I'm not...  And Patty, I think Jim Norton is wrong.  No, she has a nice little body.  I mean, it's hard when you're next to an Ari, who's a professional body shower, but you're 
[02:51:30]  pretty good.  Body shower.  Well, I'm saying, you know what I mean?  It's like when you've been showing your fucking body for a long time, you know...  God damn it.  The look that comes over Jim's face when he glances over is like this...  He gets angry.  It's not angry, though.  It's just fucking...  It really makes me...  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  Savage animal.  All right.  We're going to do the...  Thanks, Patty.  Boss, why are you clinking that? 
[02:52:00]  A parenthesis has better posture than her.  That wasn't bad, was it?  No.  The fact that you got the word out made it worthwhile.  I practiced it three times.  Oh, you're amazed.  Parenthesis.  All right.  Let's do Lucky Louie in Spanish.  Yeah.  I want to hear some Spanish dubbing of Jimmy Norton's voice from Lucky Louie.  Right.  It's an HBO show.  All right.  Apparently, it's got to play to the Latin audience also, right?  I would love to know how Latin people respond to this program.  Well, let's listen to Jimmy. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, we'll do the original scene and then HBO in Spanish.  That way we can hear the inflection, if that's the same, or he's just reading it.  Right.  Here we go.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, Lou.  You got a package for me?  Yeah, we got your package.  Look, man, are you having drugs sent to our house?  Because don't do that.  Just have them mail to your own house.  I can't.  My mom opens my mail.  Anyway, this isn't drugs.  It's urine. 
[02:53:00]  So, you're a piss dealer now?  I sell clean piss.  As an added convenience for my drug customers.  This piss is liquid gold.  All right.  Well, don't have it sent to my house, okay?  Very, very nice.  Very insane, right?  And here it is on HBO Español.  All right. 
[02:53:30]  Hola, Rich.  Hola, Lou.  Un paquete para mí?  Sí, vino un paquete para ti.  Si te envían drogas a nuestra casa, ya no lo hagas.  Que las manden a tu casa.  Nunca.  Mamá abre mis cartas.  En fin, no son drogas.  Es orina.  ¿Ahora estás traficando con orina?  Es orina limpia.  Es un servicio para mis otros compradores. 
[02:54:00]  Realmente,  es oro líquido.  Sí, pero no la mandes a mi casa.  No, no la mandes a mi casa.  You have finally made it, my friend.  Yep.  That is making it.  You have Spanish actors that are studying you to make sure they deliver it right.  That guy had to look at me and try to mimic my fucking face.  What an awful gig.  If you could talk with that accent, you would pick up any girl on the planet if he had that... 
[02:54:30]  That's not a sexy, suave accent.  That's a fucking...  Hey, look.  Are the Minutemen looking?  I'm trying to sneak under a bridge accent.  I don't think so.  I thought it was a...  Because you're dumb.  You think that any...  It's not a sexy accent.  A sexy accent is like a French or a foreign or a Dutch thing.  I disagree.  You know.  I spend a lot of time in Costa Rica, okay?  And I tell you what.  Spanish language can be hard.  Especially when you say something like...  Darme la lengua, chico, por favor.  Oh, what is that?  Give me your tongue, boy, please. 
[02:55:00]  Oh.  See?  But he's pulled out through a slit throat.  Yeah, exactly.  And that of your family, too.  No.  That's different.  Costa Rica is different than this guy.  This guy's not Costa Rica.  This is some fucking guy.  Yeah.  He probably threw his fucking apron at a manager and walked away to bring $5,000 worth of  yayo to Omar six months before he fucking did this.  All right.  Back to Lucky Louie with Jim. 
[02:55:30]  Here's the original scene.  Aw.  Aw.  What is that?  It's Alan.  Oh.  That Walter sounds like a master cocksman.  Apparently...  Apparently it ain't Walter.  Ellen's cheating on him.  That's reprehensible.  Aw.  Oh, you like that, you little whore.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  There you go. 
[02:56:00]  For those of you that can't see this, Lou and I are standing at his door, and we're in  the hallway, and that's coming from the apartment across the hall.  Yeah.  So I'm sure most people got that, but that's what that is.  All right.  And here's the same scene in Spanish.  Oh.  Aw.  That is so weird. 
[02:56:30]  That really is strange.  I didn't even know if that was me or Lou.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Can't tell.  Can't tell these guys apart.  They both sound the same.  They sound similar, yeah.  All right.  Here's another scene.  I want to meet the guy or see the photo of the guy they have doing my voice.  Yeah, what does he look like?  Trying to find it.  You're trying to find it?  Okay.  Oh, you got his name?  No, that's what I'm trying to get.  Okay.  Here's the original Lucky Louie scene.  It's in a lettuce field.  With Jimmy? 
[02:57:00]  What is that guy doing to her?  He's destroying her.  Oh, shit.  Shit.  Yeah, but what is he doing?  At first, I was going to go with doggy style, but you know what?  I think it might be classic missionary, but on a hard surface.  You can hear him compressing a rib cage.  And there's definitely ass play involved. 
[02:57:30]  And she's blowing him.  Wait a minute.  He's fucking her and she's blowing him?  That's physically impossible.  All for you.  All right.  Now here's the same scene on HBO Espanol.  Oh, oh, oh.  What are you doing?  Oh, oh, oh.  La destroza. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Maldición.  Sí, pero ¿qué le está haciendo ahora?  Primero el baile del perrito.  Pero ¿sabes qué?  Creo que también puede ser el misionero.  Pero están en algo muy duro.  Le está comprimiendo las costillas.  También le está estimulando por atrás. 
[02:58:30]  Y chupa también.  Un momento.  ¿La coge y le chupa?  Pero eso es imposible.  Para ti.  Para ti.  Para ti.  I'm fucking killing in Spanish.  Yeah.  Para ti.  The Spanish Jimmy is killing.  The American Jimmy stinks.  That guy's a better actor than I am.  I was going to say.  He's better than me.  Para ti.  He means it.  Let's go to Francisco in Los Angeles. 
[02:59:00]  Francisco.  Hey, what's up, guys?  That fucking guy kind of killed a joke.  He said he was an expert lover, not a master coxman.  How would you say coxman?  Maybe there's no word.  Coxman might just be an American slang.  I don't know.  You could probably say something like pitador or something.  I don't know.  You could ask Bo.  What would that be, sir?  What?  The word you just said, like what would it translate to?  Well, a slang for dick is like pito.  So, I don't know, like pitador, like matador.  I don't know.  Dick man. 
[02:59:30]  You mean a Spanish jokesman.  A jokesman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a lot of comments coming in.  Let's say hi to Rob in New York City.  Rob, what's up today?  Dude, that guy just told my son that they're the butcher in Jimmy's lines all over the place.  Oh, God.  They're fucking it up, really?  See, we can't even tell.  Give us an example.  He said the exact same thing.  The C-smith, being that I'm at work, I can't use the C-word.  Copsmith, yeah.  Yeah, they used the same thing.  They said great lover in Spanish. 
[03:00:00]  Translated, it's great lover.  That takes away a joke.  It's like a coxman is a funny word, yeah.  For someone to say a master coxman is just a silly thing.  Yeah.  A great lover.  Great lover.  You just sound like a fucking homoerotic idiot.  That's exactly how it sounded.  It came off, too, when it's translated.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  No problem, man.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, just want to point out that the Spanish woman moaning is so much more hotter.  Than the American girl.  Yeah.  Replay that. 
[03:00:30]  Forget Jimmy Vines.  Listen to the Spanish girl, and that makes that whole damn scene.  Well, sir, it's not supposed to be really sexy.  It's kind of funny.  The woman, Kim Walthorn, actually did those moans.  She had the flu.  She was violently ill that day.  Really?  Yeah, she was really sick.  She was perfect with the way the moans were timed out.  She was great.  She couldn't see me.  Oh, boy.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  I hope he's pulling this gag on me again.  This time.  I'll go. 
[03:01:00]  I want to see.  Do you want me to go?  Shall I retrieve it?  Boston numbers have arrived.  We just want to finish this bit first.  Fuck the bit.  No, I like the bit.  All right, we'll finish Jimmy's bit.  Because it's about Jimmy right now.  James in Dallas.  Hey, yo, what's going on, Jim?  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, it sounds like these guys came from a Spanish soap opera.  They said, hey, I want to make 20 bucks extra.  Read these lines.  Right.  Maria.  Yes, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  And Dave in Sacramento. 
[03:01:30]  Dave?  Hey, Jimmy.  My dad's from El Salvador, and he fucking loved the show.  Oh, nice.  He made it a point last night to go, hey, I want to take this show by accident, and I'm  freaking laughing my ass off.  Now, he watches most regular, like Tina Queens, that bullshit like that.  And it's funny and humorous, but he never laughs.  He goes, I fucking laughed last night.  I never laughed.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  No, he's actually saying, so I'm going to interrupt you. 
[03:02:00]  No, is he watching it in English?  Don't give it to me.  This is the gag.  Okay, we watched it in English.  Is he giving it in English or Spanish?  We watched it in English, because we didn't know it was in Spanish.  Okay.  But I'll tell you what.  It's better seeing you, because when you delivered the line, I got a handjob at the fucking parlor.  We knew it was true.  That was even better.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  Glad you guys enjoyed it.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, here's the last clip we're doing today.  It's Jimmy on Lucky Louie, Sunday nights on HBO 1030. 
[03:02:30]  This week's a good one, too.  It's The Robbery.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  Poor Walter.  That guy never had a chance.  Walter's just the beginning.  Having this skill set like that running around?  Kim's pussy hears about this.  It's over for you.  Goodbye, Rich.  Whatever.  I'll be out here for a couple minutes. 
[03:03:00]  Suck it, Ellen.  Suck my big, beautiful black cock.  All right.  All right.  And now here's that same scene in...  Something noir.  I think noir.  Negro.  Negro?  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Negro.  Negro, right?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Pobrecito, Walter.  Ni cómo ayudarle.  Walter fue el primero. 
[03:03:30]  Con alguien con tanta habilidad,  si el coñito de Kim llega a saber de esto,  estás acabado.  Adiós, Rich.  Sí, vete.  Voy a esperar un momento.  Así, encanto.  Chupa mi grande y maravilloso pinterrón.  I sound really like a fucking lecherous creep  when I say it in Spanish.  I prefer it. 
[03:04:00]  I think he's more of a perv, the Spanish guy.  Yeah, he's dirty.  He just added his own dialogue.  He probably said Lucy instead of Ellen.  Lucy's the kid.  Creep.  Fucking dirty Spanish man fucking up my lines.  Who would know?  You know what I mean?  You can tell he's unclipped.  Oh, a little private conversation going on  between Rich and...  Rich, we're doing a radio show right now.  Rich Shapiro?  Yeah.  Has he been on?  Yeah.  Just bringing up people's names, comics, whatnot.  Rich, focus over here.  Why are you making a jerk off side? 
[03:04:30]  No, no, no.  Okay.  What are you doing?  Rich is subtle, man.  I'm asking about this show,  but I don't want to say it on the radio  because I don't want to give anything away.  Then why wouldn't you ask for it on a break?  In case it didn't...  Did you know the mics are still on?  Yeah, that's why I went over here.  So, find it well.  Say something from over there.  Seriously.  There's ratings that I want to know.  It's, you know...  Yeah, I can hear it.  Aren't there ratings?  Yeah, you can't hear that.  Opie's pocket.  Ratings?  Before we do ratings, I have to pee.  No.  All right.  Let's let me take a break.  Ow.  You know what you want to wait in?  Come in.  I got a pee, too, but I want to see them now. 
[03:05:00]  No?  No?  It's exciting.  Unwrapping.  Oh.  Stupid Ben gives them to you.  That's because it's the gag.  I know.  Wait, is this your copy?  Are they the same?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, this was your copy.  They're the same numbers? 
[03:05:30]  See, that's what they're expecting.  Rip it up.  That's why I hand it to you.  See, they expected the other thing.  The ratings for Boston, as you know by now.  And some people out there don't care about this stuff, unfortunately.  We do.  But we do, and I'm sure there's a lot of listeners out there that do care.  We're back on regular radio in a lot of cities,  and the ratings for Boston came in today.  They made it very easy for us in Boston.  Yep.  Okay.  12-plus in Boston.  We're on WBCN. 
[03:06:00]  April, that was just David Lee Roth.  Yep.  Just David Lee Roth.  We had nothing to do with that.  They had a 1.6.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  For May, that would be us.  Obviously, just us.  Yep.  We did a 3.4.  We more than doubled David Lee Roth's ratings.  Very good.  In one month.  Nice.  In one month.  Does that go by, like, millions of listeners?  How does it work?  Don't even try to think about it.  Is this your orange juice?  You'll strain yourself. 
[03:06:30]  Keep Dave on the line.  What a creep.  Persons, 18 of 34.  April, April was all David Lee Roth, and he got a fine share that added up to a 2.3.  2.3.  May was the Opie and Anthony show, 6.7.  Oh, that's nice.  Fuck.  Is that almost triply?  That is nice.  Almost three times.  That is nice.  Persons, 25 to 54.  That's the gals and the guys.  April, David Lee Roth, just David.  1.5. 
[03:07:00]  25 to 54 persons.  May, the Opie and Anthony show, 4.1.  Wow.  Beautiful.  Oh, Boston.  Thank you.  And men, 18 plus.  David Lee Roth, in April, by himself, did a 1.9.  Opie and Anthony show in May, did a 5.3.  Wow.  That's great.  That's almost tripling.  Almost tripling.  Almost tripling.  Almost tripling across the board.  You Boston people.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Go Sox.  I believe. 
[03:07:30]  No, I think we might have talked to you back in the day, huh, Dave?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  How are you?  Dave Wellington, the PD of WBCN.  This guy gets it.  He's aggressive.  He's passionate.  Well, you guys make it easy.  We love the promos, man.  They're great.  We're having so much fun with it.  You guys make it easy.  I think from earlier this morning's show, we got about 30 or 40 promos diced up from  that.  So the pain will continue.  Oh, yeah.  Man town.  Please keep sending them in because the audience is loving it. 
[03:08:00]  And they don't even really fully understand the whole thing, but they're catching on.  Yeah, I'm so glad that you guys pointed that out.  I mean, it's just such a joke.  But congratulations on the ratings this morning.  We're so ecstatic.  I'll be getting drunk in about an hour here.  Nice.  Surprise coming out of Boston.  Yeah, no kidding.  We need more breakdowns.  Straight bird is alcoholism.  We need more breakdowns immediately.  About an hour when he hits the road.  What's up, Dave?  I can't wait to see you guys in August for the comedy tour. 
[03:08:30]  That's going to be a great time.  The phones are blowing up over that, too.  Are you giving away a lot of tickets?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  And, yeah, we'll be at Worcester Centrum in Boston August 5th.  We want it to be closer to Boston, but, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's just keep it at that.  Let's just keep it at that.  Someone is holding a grudge still, unfortunately.  So we'll still have fun at the Worcester Centrum.  Yeah.  All right, Dave.  I have a question for Dave.  Has Hillman really been responding, or is it just that stupid ass-kissing fucking phony line he belted out? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, that's all.  Well, I tried to tune him in this morning coming to work, and all I heard was...  Hey, Dave.  I couldn't hear anything.  By the way, Dave, you have a fine radio voice.  Oh, thanks, guys.  What markets did you work in?  Sounds like Elo in a little bit.  I worked in Detroit, and I worked in Grand Rapids in Michigan, and worked in Vegas for the last six years.  That was the last time that I talked to you guys. 
[03:09:30]  You know what?  I realized I was much better not on the air.  It was interesting, when we were at WNEW getting syndicated all over the place, and we got syndicated to Vegas, Dave wanted us on his station.  Yeah.  He had the big FM signal out there, and we had to be on a crappy AM.  Right, right.  Why?  Well, there was things going on.  Things.  That were out of our hands.  Always things.  And Dave was very frustrated, because he wanted us bad.  Dave sounds like Eric Logan, though.  Yeah.  A little Elo-ish.  A lot of Elo.  Makes me like Dave more.  Definitely sounds a lot like Eric.  Got to be Elo. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, Eric Logan is our guy here.  He's our boss, and you sound like him.  I'll be D-Lo.  He can be Elo.  Could you just say this?  No.  Jim, the Rays is coming.  Put this in your mouth for a second.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  This is uncomfortable.  How do we end this?  Well, Dave.  All right, guys.  Hey.  Thanks, guys.  I really appreciate it.  Boston loves you guys.  We appreciate everything you do for the station, and great show. 
[03:10:30]  I'll let you guys go.  Thanks.  Dave, I've noticed that BCN, it's a new BCN.  I've noticed.  You guys are so much more aggressive, and we really love it.  We love being part of that.  Yep.  We're fired up, and thanks for bringing the great rating.  By the way, that was Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Being sincere.  Being sincere.  Yes.  I stepped out of character for a minute.  Thanks, Dave.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Dave.  Dave Wellington, the PD of WBCN.  Yeah, a couple of people have asked if this is the same actor we use for ELO. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, no kidding.  Because it's not really ELO when we get the calls.  He just had a Logan voice, that's all.  Yeah.  Someone is asking, are satellite ratings broken down, too?  They're top secret for some reason.  Why is that?  We know we're doing very well on XM.  We're doing extremely well on XM, but for some reason, we're not allowed to tell people.  I never got that.  I don't either.  I never got that.  I don't understand.  I've been begging ELO, please release something, tell people something, but it's a weird top  secret thing they do.  You'll never get the ratings for satellite radio for some reason, unless they change their 
[03:11:30]  tune.  We could always lie.  You know what?  Why don't we start lying?  Seven million people listen to this program on XM Satellite Radio.  We beat Fox News.  What do you think of M. Apples?  Number one show on the platform.  That's true.  Mike in Jersey.  We are number one on the platform in the morning.  They told us that twice.  Opie?  I've been caught.  Yes, Mike.  Opie, you took your mother to see the Three Penny Opry yesterday.  What?  What?  Where was Opie?  Sweet.  Let's take a break. 
[03:12:00]  How did you do that?  I thought some.  Where was Opie?  I thought some creep was looking at me a little extra long.  Was that you?  That was me.  When I was walking up the aisle?  You looked so damn serious.  I was going to come over and say hello, but you looked so serious.  You were embarrassed to take your mother, and you were pushing her the hell out of there.  No.  I was embarrassed to be in the theater.  I used a serious face, so people leave me alone.  Ah, see, it worked.  I was really hoping you were going to-  Honestly, I like the play.  I got to be- or the opera.  Whatever it's called.  Whatever it is.  Three Penny Opera. 
[03:12:30]  I didn't realize it was going to be three hours long, though.  Oh.  Did your mom want to see it, so you had to go, right?  She actually bought me the tickets for my birthday.  Yeah.  Three Penny Opera?  What is it?  I don't know.  Yeah, Alan Cumming was in it.  Yeah, he's-  Alan Cumming.  Yeah, we heard you in the first time.  Wait, say it again.  I didn't get it.  Alan, on your way out, I noticed you were glancing at that product that he was selling.  Voss thinks there's two pennies too many in the title.  Yeah, I know.  Coming All Over is this product that he sells. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, what is-  I noticed that Lindsay wanted to buy a bottle of it.  Yeah, she noticed it.  What was that?  It's body lotion called Coming All Over.  Oh, because she asked me-  That's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah, it's his-  She asked me-  It's his product coming.  She didn't ask me if I saw that, and I'm like, where, where?  At that point, I'd been up for like 20 hours.  I was exhausted.  Yeah.  I didn't realize the play or the opera or whatever the hell it was, three hours.  Why were you there, Mike?  Yeah.  Good question.  Turn it around on him.  Good point.  No, I like the theater. 
[03:13:30]  If you had to go through a list of plays, I saw Glengarry Glen Ross.  I saw a couple of things.  What would you say are some plays that you really liked?  Oh, yeah, that's a good question.  Oh, well-  Why would you answer that?  I love it.  Why would you?  Why would you answer that, sir?  All right.  Piss break, huh?  Yeah.  I got a tinkle.  Let's bask in the ratings.  We should give her another plug for Cityscape.  Hey, thanks.  My favorite, Anari Vox, Cityscape this weekend.  I'm in Queens dancing, and I think I'm going Saturday. 
[03:14:00]  Jimmy never takes off from hitting a stage.  Never.  You must be something very special.  I love this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, hey, I'm really nice.  I'm really friendly, and I put on a great show.  Cool.  There you go.  And she bangs everyone that comes in.  Hey.  Hey, you deal with it at the door.  I'll give away free shit if you say that you heard me on Opie and Anthony.  Your own shit?  No.  Have a log, sir.  Bring your own crackers.  Have a log.  Godspeed.  Now I'm just allowed to swear here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  That was wonderful.  Thanks.  Actually added to it. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  More breakdowns of the ratings.  We'll do that next.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton's thing.  Forget me not.  You sightless caught.  Your dog just shit on my rug.  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  She's a woman, you know what I mean.  You better listen out, listen to me.  She's gonna set you free. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  There's a red light on out there in the studio.  What happened?  What's that all about?  What happened?  I don't know.  I've walked, uh, I never see that.  The red light on?  Yeah, there's a red light on.  It says on air.  Because you're usually in the air.  You never see that. 
[03:15:30]  You're usually.  What does that mean?  You're usually so responsible that you're, you make sure you're back at your post.  I didn't run to take the whiz.  I read some ratings first.  By the way, I did a little thing really fast.  Yeah.  We're already beating the Hillman, basically.  Really.  Yeah.  Look at what I did.  I got to see the breakdowns.  Look at what I did.  Mm-hmm.  We're already beating Mantown.  That stinks.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You're right.  We're already beating him. 
[03:16:00]  That sucks, man.  I wanted a little battle.  Not a little radio battle.  Wow.  We're already beating him bad, actually.  So.  That didn't take long.  There you go.  Hey, can we, uh, get some Who music?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Why?  What happened?  I'll tell you in a second.  I hope it's good news.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Just a little breaking news from the Who. 
[03:16:30]  Breaking news.  No one's dead.  Oh.  They still got two left.  Still.  Are they touring?  They still, they should be called Half Who, or Half a Who.  Half the Who.  Who?  Who?  Ladies and gentlemen, our rock stars are getting old.  Yes, they are.  Sucks to see this.  Yeah.  Age has caught up with the Who.  Oh.  Well, it did previously also with Pete Townsend. 
[03:17:00]  Unfortunately, that age was 13.  Uh, age has caught up with the Who.  At 61, Pete Townsend, who's kicking off a new world tour with Roger Daltrey, says he'll  no longer do his famous guitar-smashing act.  It's about time.  Because his body can't take it.  Didn't he stop doing that for a while, years ago, and then went back to it?  Yeah, the fans wanted it so bad.  Yeah.  Uh, can you play it any lower, please?  Because, uh...  He doesn't know what to do now. 
[03:17:30]  It's turned it up or down.  You worded it in a way where he doesn't know if it's too loud or too low, and he's freaking  out.  Obviously, it's switch positions day.  Yeah.  Danny is now in charge.  We can't hear it.  Uh-huh.  Oh, he's yelling at Stan.  Now it's Stan's fault.  Why are you yelling at Stan?  Why are you throwing stuff in the glass?  It's Stan's fault.  Because he's like, take it down a little bit.  So I took it down.  Oh, why would your mic be on?  Why would it work?  Why would the wireless mic be on when you needed it?  That's Danny's job, that's why. 
[03:18:00]  Is it on now?  No.  It's on the same pod as this mic.  Why?  It's on one or the other.  Oh.  Danny's getting uppity.  I vote me.  What?  Forget it.  All right.  At least the pad data is spelled correctly.  Age has caught up with The Who at 61.  Pete Townsend, who's kicking off a new world tour with Roger Daltrey, says he'll no longer  do his famous guitar-smashing act because his body can't take it.  I have smashed my last guitar.  This is heart attack stuff.  Oh.  Townsend told the London Times, still the hundreds, he did demolish over the past four years, probably 
[03:18:30]  added years to his life, because if ever I wanted to deal with any kind of hidden rage,  I could always take it out on the guitar.  The guitar.  Oh, nothing beats.  Remember Woodstock?  He's watching him smash it and throw it into the crowd.  He should do the windmill with his arm, he's playing, but now he throws it out of socket.  That's what he doesn't do.  I had third row for them.  Leonard Skinner.  How does it go back to you again?  Because I want to talk about The Who. 
[03:19:00]  You get out of that joke.  They were my favorite band growing up.  I had third row.  Jimmy hates The Who.  Are you crazy?  They were rock and roll.  50-year-olds.  I don't like them.  They're not Sabbath.  No, they were okay.  I don't hate them.  I just think they're very overrated.  Overrated?  I do.  What?  How do you ever say The Who is overrated?  Listen, I'm listening.  Hold on, listen.  Legendary rock band.  And this is actually one of their really good songs.  This is great.  It's okay. 
[03:19:30]  Listen to that drumming.  It's amazing.  Overrated.  Good drummer, though.  Yeah, Moon was a great drummer.  Dave Moon was amazing.  All over.  All over that kid.  It was just a quickie, but he can't do that anymore.  And then he got freaking David Lee Roth, you know, a year or two away from the Ascoss.  What happened?  What happened to the guys?  The new rock stars. 
[03:20:00]  That's why it's cool when your favorite rock star dies young.  But do you think...  It's the coolest thing for them to do.  Do you think new rock stars years from now are going to have that longevity where they get the opportunity to look old and stupid?  Not many, no.  No.  Not many.  Because there aren't...  How many super bands?  You got U2.  You know?  I always bring up U2 and Bono because he's been around forever now.  But they're still relevant.  They look cool still.  Yeah, but how much longer?  They're still getting the job done.  They're actually doing better music now than they did ten years ago. 
[03:20:30]  How much longer?  Before it starts looking a little silly.  I say they have at least another five or six years.  Yeah.  At least.  Yeah, they're working on another album.  About Pearl Jam.  They never...  Pearl Jam.  You see Eddie Vedder?  He looks pretty much the same.  Yeah, pretty much the same.  A little more weathered.  And they've been at it almost 20 years now.  Almost.  20 years.  Almost 20 years for Pearl Jam.  I saw the New York...  You remember Buster Poindex or the New York Dolls?  They did a concert again in Baltimore last summer. 
[03:21:00]  He's so old looking.  You know when the guy opened the Ark and Raiders of the Lost Ark, his face melted?  That's what he looked like.  The Nazis' face is melting?  Melted.  He was so...  He looked like a sick McJaggar.  Is he Buster Poindex or is he...  David Johansson?  David Johansson.  I could never figure it out.  They both look the same.  Ooh.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tim in Philly.  Tim, what's up?  Dan?  Yeah.  I just wanted to let you guys know you're completely blowing up in Philly, man.  The entire station is celebrating all day yesterday and today.  What were they saying? 
[03:21:30]  Just talking about the rating.  I mean, the ratings for every show during the day has gone up significantly since you  guys came on.  The entire lineup over there is just partying and celebrating their afternoon guys, number  one for 18 to 34.  The midday guys, number three for 18 to 34.  Man, so it's just fantastic.  And also, I listened to the replay at night for the XM half, and I don't really get...  That's why I didn't get to call in yesterday about this. 
[03:22:00]  But there's the guys that call in and complain about you guys talking about your ratings during  the XM half.  It's ridiculous.  I mean, if you're a fan of the show, you want to hear about the success of the program.  And it's good to hear you.  You know, you've got to be around for a long time.  I thought that was obvious to people, but for some reason it's not.  I don't know.  If we got the ratings earlier, we would talk about them over there.  But we get them.  They don't come out until just about 10-ish.  So we get them when we're over here.  We're excited about it.  And, you know, we like to let people know how we're doing, especially since... 
[03:22:30]  And it's a little selfish because there are a lot of people out there that were like,  oh, these guys are going to fall on their ass.  They're going to fail.  Blah, blah, blah.  And it's, you know, knock wood.  It doesn't seem to be happening that way.  Look, if you're a fan of the show, you know, I've been listening to you guys since you guys  first came to Philly the last time.  And it sucked when you got thrown off.  You know, you want to know that the show's going to be around for a long time.  They're going to be able to do bigger and better things.  This is vindication, my friend.  And I got to tell you someone that's not celebrating the last few days, and that's Howard Stern. 
[03:23:00]  We haven't talked to him about him in a while.  No.  Howard thought he was going to go to satellite radio and the company would completely just  collapse.  Self-destruct, fall apart.  Completely collapse.  And it's pretty obvious now that it's not going to collapse.  That we're going to save the whole freaking thing.  And it's driving him nuts.  I know it's driving him nuts.  The fact is, Howard couldn't adapt.  Someone came up with it the other day.  You know, Howard is a hack that couldn't adapt.  He couldn't adapt to the new rules of the FCC.  And it's unfortunate that those rules are there. 
[03:23:30]  Believe me.  They don't have to be as strict as they are.  They really don't.  There are some rules that should be in place.  Fine.  Blah, blah, blah.  But they're too strict.  But you have to learn to work within them or not work on radio.  He chose to not work on terrestrial radio.  We chose to do both.  Yeah.  And we can do it.  And he played in the FCC and he's just lazy.  So he spends most of his time at the end there just yelling and screaming about the FCC.  And I can't do anything.  And we say bring on the new challenge. 
[03:24:00]  When all you have is, you know, you bring a stripper in, have her get naked, have her shove a dildo in her or whatever it is.  That's fine every so often.  And to have that taken away from you on regular radio, it kind of sucks, you know.  You can't do that.  But you find other things to do.  When you realize you really don't have much else to do or talk about, when you're interviewing celebrities and all you can ask them are, you know, who did you fuck and did she like it in the ass and stuff. 
[03:24:30]  So, you can't adapt to the new rules.  So, you got to leave radio.  Yeah.  The guy wasn't able to.  Everyone always crowed about what a great interviewer Howard was.  He'd ask the things no one else would ask.  It's the same interview every fucking time.  It's not a hangout kind of talk about what's going on thing, really get information on the person.  Hey, who are you banging?  How is she?  How's that?  All right.  We heard it for 20 fucking years already. 
[03:25:00]  Where's the revolution?  You know?  And, yeah, you got to adapt.  You got to be able to adapt to the rules that are in place now.  And if you can't, you're going to be fucking done.  And when we get to the point where we get really frustrated, we just bring that material over here.  That's it.  We would have loved to have played the Spanish Jimmy over on FM radio.  For a bigger audience.  For a bigger audience.  You know, let him hear that.  But we knew that to bleep it and we needed a Spanish guy that could come over and see what dirty words were in Spanish. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, we've got to tell people about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we couldn't play it over there.  We were thinking about playing it over there.  And they got a censor guy, Al Dukes, who dumps out of the program, blah, blah, blah.  Al Dukes says they have a Spanish guy on call for situations like today.  For Spanish filth.  So he had to run it by the Spanish guy to make sure we weren't going to get in trouble.  Because the FCC goes after the Spanish stations as well.  So you reach a point where you just go, you know something, we just can't do this over here.  And it's not like, fuck, man, we really need to play this. 
[03:26:00]  Fuck.  Then we just go, all right, at 9 o'clock we'll come over to XM and we'll play it here.  Yep.  I just want to say to the people that complain that have the XM, I mean, they save up all their money from whatever.  Their menial job, they haven't bought the XM.  Now they think that the show should be tailored to their sense of humor.  And now they complain that, you know, turn your XM in.  Get rid of it because no one's going to miss you.  You know, the show is moving forward with or without you. 
[03:26:30]  It's going to go.  Dude, the thing about XM that's great, it's not just the content freedom, it's the replays.  Like you could listen to us, whether it's on XM or if you can't get a reception,  say you're in like a basement somewhere doing a weird job and you can only get Terrestrial.  If you can't get XM online, just listen to Terrestrial  and then listen to the replay in the car and pick up where you left off.  That's what I do.  I listen to YSP all day now since you went back there.  I'm in a truck.  I'm in a different truck every day, so it's hard to carry the equipment around me.  And when I get home, I hear the XM half.  It's that simple.  I truly believe that the show's gotten much better since we made the deal with CBS. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  And it's getting better every day.  Do you know how much I love getting in the car at like 11 o'clock,  coming home from a spot and flipping the show on and hearing us?  We're checking out Ron and Fez nine hours after they did a show.  It's fucking great, dude.  I used to hate when we'd be on NEW and you could not hear the show again.  Yeah, show is done unless you heard it in Best of like months later.  But in Best of, you're usually on vacation.  You didn't get to hear it.  I've thought about that too.  That's got to be weird to the people that are, let's say,  are listening to us on YSP in Philly.  They get one shot.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[03:27:30]  We did a little, we did a quick survey and there's like,  I think it came out to some like 30% of our audience,  maybe more don't hear us when we're live.  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah.  It was a quick little survey later in the day.  I think,  actually I think the people that heard us live was about 30%.  So 70% of the people were listening when they wanted or an afternoon drive  or what have you.  Dude,  when I was in LA and Yoshi had,  cause Yoshi has XM and he's playing this and I'm listening to the show.  How weird is that?  In LA, right?  It's bizarre, man.  It's like six o'clock in LA.  It's like,  I'm listening to the LA show. 
[03:28:00]  I brought my,  my fight to one of our trips to LA and got up early and I,  I turned on two Oh two.  I'm just drinking some coffee on the deck or whatever.  And I'm like,  that's not,  that's awesome.  And we're way over here.  Like it was weird.  That's when it finally hit me.  Like,  man,  this is crazy.  Tank,  uh,  is asking.  See you buddy.  All right,  good.  Uh,  tank on instant feedback.  Are you guys beating Stern's old numbers before David Lee Roth took the gig?  No.  Jesus dude.  No.  We've been here a month.  Can you give us some time? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  We're not stupid.  We're not going to lie.  Oh,  we got a long way to go.  Yeah.  We got a long way to go.  We're a month in.  And for,  for the month that we have been doing this a little over a month,  uh,  we couldn't be happier with the results that are coming in ratings wise.  They're a well above what I ever expected,  uh,  so far.  We did some quick math and we're already beating man town.  It's a one month,  one month.  Uh,  how does there,  you know,  20 years,  the guy had a huge following.  I'm not getting,  never going to downplay that.  We'll never sit here no matter how despicable the guy treated us, 
[03:29:00]  uh,  when we worked for the same company,  but we'll never sit here and lie about it.  Cause you look stupid when you,  when you go on and go,  Oh,  that guy was nothing.  And guy fucking built a huge empire,  uh,  in radio had huge numbers.  And,  uh,  those are big shoes to fill and just got lazy and moved on.  He got lazy after a while toward the end.  Forget about it.  Got to give him credit.  He's making a hundred million dollars to just a million a year to call it in,  take Friday's off and run out to the Hamptons every Friday to check out his 
[03:29:30]  mansion.  That's being built.  I hear a rumor of an,  the entire month of August being taken off.  I'm not joking.  That's that right now is something that I didn't confirm,  but it's,  it's a very strong rumor that his vacation time gives him the entire month of  August.  He's fucking his entire faithful audience.  And,  and,  and they don't even know it yet.  He doesn't give a shit about his audience.  He barely ever did.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  And now it's just purely about the cash, 
[03:30:00]  which,  you know,  something,  I don't know,  maybe you reach a point and that's where he is.  Fine.  Have fun.  You know,  he's,  he's getting the ratings as we are,  as they come in and he'll,  he'll spin another way.  Like I,  I don't care anymore.  I moved on.  I don't care.  You know,  keep talking about me.  I don't care.  We know radio people.  He's getting these ratings cause he's hoping that,  uh,  we were failing miserably.  So the company completely collapses and it's driving him nuts.  As he sees these numbers come out one station at a time and we're clicking up.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  They would have loved to have seen either us go down or at least us just stay,  uh,  flat,  you know,  like no one staying flat is the worst because that means no one cares.  Like you're just a non entity.  And,  and it's kind of like,  are people,  do they know we're here?  So to see an increase like this really means people were like,  wow,  this is cool.  Let me get on board.  Let me tell some friends about it.  They're back.  And,  uh,  couldn't be happier. 
[03:31:00]  Thanks Boston,  man.  Let's go to Derek in Boston.  Derek.  Hey,  what's up?  Yeah,  that's no rumor Anthony.  Uh,  I already mentioned it about two weeks ago,  a whole month of August off.  Oh man,  the only pass have got to get on this.  Go have fun with the Stern fans and,  and try to call into Howard and ask him when he's going to tell his audience that,  uh,  he's taking the whole month of August off so he could,  uh,  watch his mansion being built in the Hamptons.  Did you see my pathetic email last night,  by the way,  he takes the month of August off.  I sent an email to,  uh,  Opie and, 
[03:31:30]  um,  uh,  Ben last night.  Hey guys,  why don't we take off between Christmas and new year?  I got it too.  And you said like radio,  like,  like real radio people do.  We're shy.  Cause we never do.  Like we never do that.  We,  we,  we figure like last year we figured a lot of XM people were going to be getting their XMs and they wanted to,  uh,  check us out for the first time.  So we worked the week between Christmas and new year.  Cause nobody was anywhere to be found.  I mean,  everyone's on vacation. 
[03:32:00]  Radio people just take it off.  So this year I'm like,  Hey guys,  do you think I'd like to go away for Christmas this year?  Call me crazy.  And there's Howie.  What do you think?  Uh,  uh,  the month of August.  I'd like to take off.  I want actually,  uh,  Robin,  if I could,  uh,  an entire,  uh,  rotation of the earth around the sun off.  Could I have that please?  He already works four days a week and now he's taking the whole month of August off.  Yeah.  He's not gonna be on tomorrow.  Nope.  He's,  he's already on his way to the Hamptons.  They have a picture of his, 
[03:32:30]  uh,  mansion being built.  The concrete has been poured.  You know the gall of that motherfucker once?  I heard he had a problem at the bank once and he pointed out his balance and they couldn't do enough for him.  Oh come on,  I'm teasing.  I just want to feel,  I just want to feel like a big shot today.  Big shot.  I just want to feel like.  Hey,  big shot.  I just want to feel like I actually accomplished something in my life.  Big man,  biggest man in town.  Hey Luigi, 
[03:33:00]  how about the deluxe short dinner for my friend?  But Mr. Udo,  the kitchen is closed.  Let's go to,  uh,  Rick in Philly.  Rick,  what's up?  Best slap ever.  What's going on guys?  Hey.  Hey.  So you're on a good topic here.  It's not even on today?  Hold on.  Howie decided to take today and tomorrow off.  Yeah,  he took,  he took today off.  He's taking tomorrow off.  But it's news to me that he's taking the whole month of August off.  I mean,  he's real good at hiding that kind of stuff.  I must admit that.  God damn, 
[03:33:30]  man.  You guys are coming in loud and clear in Philly now.  I feel so sorry for Mel Karmazin,  our old boss.  Thanks,  Rick.  There you go,  Mel.  Have fun with that.  Yeah.  What's that one's going to hurt you eventually?  When he finds out,  when he finds out that you guys are doing real good in Philly and he's always been real competitive,  you know,  trying to start something,  but he's on satellite radio.  Like,  what's his,  what's his,  like,  how's he going to get this Philly?  Philly seems to be a real big market.  I'm born in radio.  We're knocking him out of the headlines.  Right.  We're not talking about him as much. 
[03:34:00]  And guess what?  More and more stories are coming out about us.  We had the lady from Reuters today and we're talking to AP after the show today.  We got the Washington Post next week.  Oh,  nice.  It's all,  yeah,  because we're starting on WJFK on Monday.  There's a story right here in the Jersey Star-Ledger.  Right.  There's a story about our conversation yesterday with Dr. Ian Smith.  I mean,  these are things now that...  Is regular radio completely done for him,  you think?  I mean,  forever?  He's just going to take this...  He said it. 
[03:34:30]  I know he said it on the air.  He goes,  I'll never go back to terrestrial radio.  He said it.  Guys,  even if competition,  you know,  takes over big markets like Philly and stuff like that.  Dude,  years ago...  I said bring it on,  man.  I said bring it on.  We haven't been scared of Howard in well over a decade.  Years ago,  I might have said,  yeah,  in that situation.  There was a time that people feared him.  We don't fear him.  It's been years.  Years.  And he might have done it years ago.  He might have actually,  you know, 
[03:35:00]  come back  just out of competition.  But now,  he's making so much money.  I don't think Sirius would want to  take away their exclusivity.  I think Mel's got a plan  where he's going to be making money  with a lot of commercial time.  But,  they're even having trouble with that.  I mean,  it's very hard to  take a limited audience,  which is what he has,  and go to an advertiser  and say,  look,  we want this much money  because it's Howard. 
[03:35:30]  Well,  yeah,  but it's not Howard  talking to a lot of people.  So,  I could care if the fucking Pope  is selling my stuff.  If he's talking to,  you know,  500,000 people  as opposed to 12 million,  I'm not going to pay you as much.  It's just the way it works.  And you know what's really killing him?  Like,  if you do...  Hey, we're sorry, man.  I'm...  Voss is talking  and I know it's unimportant.  No,  this is very important.  But,  all right,  thanks, Rick, man.  Yeah,  he just wants to say goodbye.  All right, Rick.  What's killing him is too,  like,  when you have such a big audience,  say,  you know,  you say you're working in theaters,  sold out theaters,  and they go,  okay,  you go back to those theaters  for 10 times the money 
[03:36:00]  but there's only 50 people in there.  Right.  You don't care about the money.  You're going,  I can't do this.  That's the competitive nature  of people that are in this business  or your business.  You could be handed,  and it's true,  you can be handed  a lot of money for something,  but when the time comes to perform,  if you're performing  in front of a very small crowd,  that's what hits you,  not the money you're making.  It's like,  you know,  fuck, man,  I want the big crowd there.  I want the,  you know,  that sound  when you come out on stage, 
[03:36:30]  you know,  you want,  when you go out in the street  and you're doing something,  you want a crowd of people  and no amount of money  changes that  if you're a performer  that likes people  and likes having a huge crowd.  I had a gig,  I did,  David Tell and I did  the Borgata in Philly  and we sold it out  in 11 days  and Dave's agency,  the Gersh agency,  I think hates my guts  because YSP,  I knew it was going to be  big for us.  Lappable angel.  I know that,  you know that,  Ope knows that, 
[03:37:00]  Dan knows that,  Voss knows that,  Eric knows that,  Ben knows that,  Steve knows that,  but a lot of people  don't know that.  Like Norm the trucker,  he's listening to us  for the first time right now.  Norm knows that!  Now Norm knows.  But I was,  we want to do a second show,  we did the first show,  it was sold out,  Gersh comes back and goes,  well we don't think  Norton's helping  with the ticket sales at all,  it's all Dave's fans.  And Philly,  he's sold out.  No, no,  but I mean,  not to do it Dave,  this is,  you're not kidding?  No,  this is not Dave at all,  this is agent stuff.  I swear to God,  I thought you were just like,  agent shit.  Agent shit.  This is agent shit completely. 
[03:37:30]  So,  I really thought you were like,  setting up for something.  No, no,  Dave is great,  Dave has no ego about that stuff,  he was like,  yeah man,  he wanted me to headline  the late show,  he headlined the early show,  I mean Dave's like,  he's not the fucking,  I got a headline.  It's a headline,  I literally could have made,  probably if we had sold it,  three times what I made  on the first show.  Yeah.  And,  because Gersh had done that,  I'm like,  well maybe,  I don't know man,  maybe we're just not  strong enough yet,  maybe we just came back  on YSP,  and I'm like,  now we'll probably sell it,  but I didn't know.  So I didn't take that late show,  because I didn't know 
[03:38:00]  if I had enough new stuff  for Philly,  do you really want to follow  a tale on a late show,  killing,  I mean that motherfucker,  if he hits,  is devastating to go on after.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm like,  I wanted to make sure  that it was going to be  a great show,  and I didn't point it,  I'm babbling,  but I turned it down,  because the money wasn't worth  possibly not selling the show  or having a bad show,  it wasn't worth the money  to embarrass yourself.  And that's what it's about,  maybe at some point,  we will get to that point  where we go,  you know something,  fuck the product,  fuck the people,  just give me the check. 
[03:38:30]  I say eventually we do.  There's two,  you think some,  I would for those days,  if we're going to be honest  with each other,  yeah,  I think eventually  we head down that same road,  unfortunately.  I don't know, man.  We'll lose the passion  a little bit.  I'll think about it  during the three weeks  we're taking off in August.  Only three, though, people.  That's right.  We're probably going to do  a live remote  from one of the weeks  on your vacation, right?  This is how pathetic we are.  Howard's taking  the whole month of August off.  We're taking a week,  but we have to come back early  to do one of the comedy festivals.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  The August 26th one.  That's still part  of our freaking vacation.  Vacation time damage.  You know what we've got  to figure out how to do?  We're losers.  We could have went to Montreal  for the comedy festival.  I know with XM and CBS  it's kind of hard  because they both  kind of wanted  to their facilities.  which is,  you know,  that's something good and bad.  We'll figure it out.  Except for having to go  to fucking D.C.  We could have broadcast,  I don't know,  CBS.  Broadcast.  Up in August.  In August.  In August to have coffee.  Oh,  when he does that accent,  I want to fucking  hammer his cheekbones. 
[03:39:30]  That was really funny  on the replay,  by the way.  What?  His, uh...  You saved that bit.  I was going to play  that piece of crap  and then move on  and it was like  10 minutes of gold.  I forgot Steve's acting.  You say that  because I was just like,  all right,  let's move on  as quickly as possible.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Jimmy's like,  no, let's stop the show  and rewind  and go through this slowly.  Oh, that fucking...  Even Bill's knock stunk.  I forgot about  how awful that was.  Fuck, what was the line, Steve?  When, um...  Uh...  Oh, what are you...  What are you doing at Matt?  That's terrible. 
[03:40:00]  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  What, Steve?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's...  He was just trying to act.  Oh, he should be fucking belted  right in that little  change person belly.  Trying to be an actor.  Wait, what the fuck  is going at you?  You in my house.  Get out of my house.  Get out of my house.  I'll handle this.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Honey, I'll handle this.  Honey, go back 
[03:40:30]  into the living room.  Do you think  he wants a piece of cheese?  I...  Welcome back  for your grandson, Steve.  Let's go to Michael  in Atlanta.  Michael.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Michael.  Oh, good news for Jimmy.  What up?  What?  Oh, first week.  Lucky Louie.  1.5 million viewers.  Second week.  3.8 million viewers.  How do you know that?  It was on tvguide.com.  Are you bullshitting? 
[03:41:00]  I am absolutely not.  That is a 153% gain in viewers.  So long, Steve.  That's almost unheard of on TV.  It was...  It was good.  I'm talking, Ope.  It was...  Let's, uh...  Just say adios to Jimmy.  No, no, no.  Let's say nothing.  It was good working with you.  Dude, are you...  Are you fucking bullshitting me, man?  Don't do that to me.  Absolutely not.  Let's give us a small part in one of your movies, please.  Here's what Louie asked.  A little small...  We can even play the jocks.  Something bigger than Voss is getting on.  Dude, I...  No, we wrote your entire movie.  Don't think...  On HBO.  There's numbers.  Don't think I haven't thought about how to have you guys on... 
[03:41:30]  Don't think I haven't fucking loved...  Like, wanted to pitch that to Louie about finding a way to have you guys play jocks and  I'm as rich, fucking love you guys, and you destroy me somehow and wreck me.  Believe me, I've thought of it, and I want to...  Now that I would love...  But we, uh...  Louie told me that the first week is all advertising.  That's the promo department.  The second week, he said, is the key week.  That's the one that matters.  Because then it's like, did people talk about it, whatever?  And that's why we both did press in the second week.  And, uh, believe me, don't think that they don't know this fucking show. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm fucking Barnacle Jim the Leech.  You think I don't know?  You think I don't know?  Barnacle and the Leech.  You think I don't know I'm on that show partially because of the fucking advertising power I am?  You think I'm deluded?  Wait, but wait a second.  Shut your...  I've got a question to ask you.  I'll suck your cock right here.  I'm in such a good mood right now.  What a threat.  And do you know, and for...  Those are gigantic numbers.  Huge.  On HBO.  3.8 million.  Wow.  Thanks, Rich.  That's great.  Dude, what did Entourage do in the second week?  I don't have that in front of me, but just... 
[03:42:30]  $18 trillion.  I imagine it probably retained all that number.  I mean...  Where did we find this?  Because we were trying to find it.  TVguide.com and you go to the Entertainment News and you have to click down through to yesterday's  news.  Entertainment.  I tried to get through to you guys yesterday, but I couldn't get let through.  Baby Doll is looking for it.  If we did that, that's a really good sign because...  Oh yeah, then again, Louis did do The View and I did Leno and Louis did Conan and fucking...  Brock from Brownsville, Texas is saying, looks like Kate Beckinsale is going to be calling 
[03:43:00]  Lil' Jimmy.  Yeah, of course he will.  Well, you look at something like Sopranos, you know, they may start off with $5 million,  but they decreased throughout the whole season and it's unheard of of a game on TV.  We were basically, look, in the second week, I was, I wanted, my goal in the second week  was basically to at least just maintain what we had the first week, maybe a little bit  more.  It might have been much to ask for.  Again, it's only the second week of the show, man.  Yeah.  So I was just rooting for kind of a maintenance thing. 
[03:43:30]  Let it build by word of mouth.  Look, if we did more, I don't know if your number's accurate.  I'm not calling you a liar.  Absolutely.  I mean, I have it right in front of me.  Louis.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  HBO's Louis Gets Lucky from TV Guide.  After its premiere drew only 1.5 million viewers, HBO's Lucky Louis is expected to go  the way of Lisa Kudrow's Much Missed by Me, the comeback.  But after six more airings of the episode, Variety reports that its numbers shot all the  way up to 3.8 million.  Hug. 
[03:44:00]  Oh.  Gee, wonder if I don't need to see that would be a national catchphrase right now if Valerie  Cherish had been shown so much love.  Wow.  That's better than a network.  I don't know if it's better than a network.  No, sir.  It's better than a lot of network shows.  There you go.  It's nice.  Okay, so you're saying...  Thank you, buddy, for that call.  You made my day.  Thank you so much.  I have a question for you.  So you're saying, Chris, your media, like, say a guy tested for a Comedy Central show.  Like, say I tested and it's between me and another guy.  Wouldn't it be to Comedy Central's benefit to take custody advertisement? 
[03:44:30]  Is that what you're saying that HBO did?  They, yeah, Comedy Central understands the same thing that HBO understands.  You have to be good for it.  But if they're going to put you or a guy who's almost as good as you, because, I mean, it's  a show where you're riffs, so you're probably great.  I mean, as much as I like the shit on Voss, he isn't fucking really, brilliantly fast as  an improv guy.  An ass, but really...  Could you use the word complete?  Colin had the best description of Voss.  He said, he's like, I can't believe that he's like such a dumb guy is so funny.  He's too dumb to be this funny.  He's a...  Voss is an absolute rarity. 
[03:45:00]  Normally to be as fast as Voss is in this devastating...  You gotta be kind of sharp.  You have to be smart.  Yeah.  He is as stupid a man as I've ever met anywhere.  And one of the sharpest, funniest fucks.  What a compliment.  That's...  I really do mean that.  He's a funny fuck, man.  And that could, by the way, go down as the best backhanded compliment I've ever heard  in my life.  Absolutely.  Because it's so vicious and so complimentary.  But, no, of course they understand.  And so accurate.  No, I don't think they understand. 
[03:45:30]  I don't think they understand the power of radio.  Some of them.  Especially back...  We have now...  XM fucking covers this country and it covers Canada.  I mean, terrestrial covers what it covers.  We are on in two countries with this platform.  And I don't know how you guys could say how anybody would ever doubt from your past records,  from your past performances, everywhere you go, you win.  That's why they...  Everywhere you go.  But it's our past performances that keep people from just scooping us up.  Wouldn't you just put us everywhere?  Yeah.  We really are a proven show. 
[03:46:00]  I'm not...  And this is nothing that...  I'm not going, hey, we rule.  We're the best.  It's just, over the years, and we have quite a track record, quite a few years together,  we just have a proven record of being able to go into cities and at least pop the ratings  up ahead.  A little bit.  A little bit.  We do a good job.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you just put us everywhere?  But the reputation that precedes us, along with the nice ratings, is that we are horrific.  We get entire staffs, entire floors of buildings fired. 
[03:46:30]  So, but listen...  I've once started counting the amount of people that got fired.  Oh, my God.  It's like the Holocaust.  I gave up somewhere in the 30s.  It's awful.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, no, I know.  I had to start thinking a little too much after that point.  I'm like, wow.  Oh.  That means it's got to be close to 50 people.  I was in the 30s.  We're despicable.  I was in the 30s.  But, you know, I think we're going to try to stay around. 
[03:47:00]  We're going to really try.  The photos of Patty wearing the Porn Star's jeans are up on opianthony.com.  Don't you love that with the internet?  Like instant.  And go to iliketolisten.com.  iliketolisten.com.  We're trying to get some traffic for those guys.  They're a sponsor.  iliketolisten.com.  But the photos are up on opianthony.com as well.  The thing about this show that people love, one of the things is that it's a funny show.  The listeners know that we really love the listeners.  They understand that because of the way we interact with them and fucking...  They know. 
[03:47:30]  And call them idiots.  Yeah, but I mean, look, we credit them, all that stuff.  But there's also this volatile sense to this show.  And I have it in a lot of the fucking show where it's like, you know what the show?  It's the hot chick that for some reason is fucking you.  And you're like, I know this is going to end soon.  So I might as well enjoy it while it lasts.  We'll just be gone.  Oh, boy.  What is...  Oh, is that...  Oh, good.  Oh, you got man-town stuff?  Oh, we got some man-town merchandise.  Save this for tomorrow, please.  Oh, boy.  Don't even tempt us. 
[03:48:00]  Save this for tomorrow.  Just tuck it away in a safe spot.  We'll do it tomorrow.  Let's tease it.  What is the...  They have an actual DVD.  Baron Heidel.  Oh, just start pulling clips.  I know it's going to be hard because every one of them is going to be a douche show.  Ben, just show me the CD.  I won't say anything.  Yeah, just keep it for tomorrow.  We got man-town merchandise coming in.  Hey, when do we start in Washington?  Monday.  Monday.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We never did play...  Don't tease us. 
[03:48:30]  We never played that audio everyone else was crying about either.  Don and Mike?  Yeah.  All right, we can play that tomorrow.  We have to actually leave.  We have an AP interview.  Yes, we do.  Sorry, kids.  Rich Voss is going to be at Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  All weekend long?  Thursday through Sunday, but...  I might be there tomorrow, Rich.  Tomorrow's what?  Friday?  Yeah.  Late shows.  Late shows.  So you can come in.  12.30.  Oh, you're doing late shows?  Yeah, late shows.  Who's doing the other shows?  It's Gay Pride Week.  They got some guy, Hal Sparks or something.  Oh, my God.  Is he really gay or you just play the gay guy on TV? 
[03:49:00]  I don't know.  I don't even know who he is.  I do.  He's on...  What the fuck?  He was on that show...  Are you serious?  Lindsay's, like, family's coming up and her parents and stuff and they're all excited  to go to Caroline's and...  Oh, crap.  Gay.  Why?  What day are they coming?  I know.  Hal is this weekend.  Hal?  Hal's pretty well gone.  They don't want to wait until 12.30 to see me.  I mean, it's a better show.  Every weekend there's a good show at Caroline's.  One week I need to go there.  I'm not going there, by the way.  Don't even...  You can start the jokes, whatever, but I ain't going there.  Why?  Hal Sparks might not be gay. 
[03:49:30]  I hate theme comedy.  Yeah, good for you.  As you should.  As you should.  Because a lot of people are going to go, oh, you're gay bashing again.  I don't want to go to gay theme night.  I don't want to go to the Italian theme night.  No, no.  I don't think it's a theme.  I hate theme comedy.  There's no theme.  I hate when you've got to get three...  It is theme when they're all gay.  I hate when you get three cripples on one bill.  Nothing against, uh, I'm Louis.  Everything.  Everything against Louis Twitchell Santani.  Santani.  And I'm Louis Twitchell Sant... 
[03:50:00]  Shut up.  I'm not a fan of the theme comedy.  As you shouldn't be.  Oh, God.  As you shouldn't be.  My show's not a theme.  Yes, it is awful.  No, you're doing the late shows.  You're doing the late shows.  Maybe we'll go to the late shows, but then it's like women's comedy night.  Well, but if you come Saturday, Vega's hosting the guy who called his funny, Bonnie and me.  It's a great show, but, you know...  It shows up.  It's all Down Syndrome comics, and he wonders why he's there, too.  And I can't...  I don't even get the headline.  And they're all sitting there picking apart his punchlines while holding medals. 
[03:50:30]  Joey Vega, I love, man.  You'll enjoy Vega.  Vega is a cool motherfucker.  He's just here Saturday with us.  All right.  Maybe I'll go to the late show, then.  All right.  We've got to go, but you're going to do the late shows at Carolina.  I hate theme comedy, too, Opie.  I hate it, on principle.  Are you with me, or what?  Fuck yes, man.  I hate it.  Yeah, it's funny, funny.  That's what I was thinking.  How was on that Queer as Folk?  What's that?  How was on Queer as Folk, right?  I don't even know who he is.  He might be a good comic.  I don't know if he's a funny stand-up. 
[03:51:00]  I think...  I don't like him because he didn't like your joke that you played on him on Collins' show.  No, he hated my guts.  But, again, I can't say he's a bad actor.  I just don't know.  Where Jimmy asked him a question, he started answering it, and then Jimmy just walks out  of the room and slams the door in the middle of the story.  It's one of the greatest gags that you pull on someone.  It's so funny.  The thought that someone's sitting there thinking you're interested, you ask him a question,  they start talking.  The guy turns around, walks out of the room, and slams the door.  You'd be left there.  If I was that guy, I would sit there laughing my ass off that you pulled that over on me. 
[03:51:30]  Patrice would be sitting there.  There was a barber chair in the green room.  And my favorite was when Patrice would be on the barber chair, and whether Richard  would be there or fucking Robinson, and I would go by the door.  I would stand with one arm on the door jam and one arm on the door itself, and all the  regulars knew what was coming.  And Patrice would hide his face because he couldn't look.  Oh, no.  And he can usually look, by the way.  Oh, he would not add that.  He would always have to be quiet and not look because he knew he was going to laugh.  And as soon as I got somebody, Colbert was one of the best ones I ever got, and this 
[03:52:00]  is why he's so funny, because he loved it.  Dude, what the hell have you been doing out in L.A.?  Well, I started, what?  And that door slams.  And the greatest part for me was to hear Patrice's roar.  It was so loud, he would fucking roar.  And I knew it was a good one.  It's a good bit.  That is a funny, funny bit.  Stephen Colbert, by the way, that Colbert Rapport is one of the best shows on TV.  Is it really that funny?  He's so goddamn funny.  He is, and it's not a whole, like, big staff thing. 
[03:52:30]  Right.  It's just him.  It's better than the Daily Show.  Yeah, I got to say.  Absolutely.  The Daily Show's kind of wearing thin.  It's a lot of the same type of material all the time.  Jon Stewart's getting a little too serious about himself as far as the newscaster goes.  And Stephen Colbert, it's a perfect parody of all the independent shows that are on Fox  and CNN.  He takes the right-wing angle on it and twists it around where it's so ridiculous that it's 
[03:53:00]  just hysterical.  Prediction?  Jon Stewart jumps to MSNBC.  So he can still do it, but a little more serious.  You think a real news guy, but with a comic angle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Wow, good call, baby.  Like Ober, right.  Well, Colbert's fucking hysterical.  I would love to get him on this show.  Stephen Colbert.  Well, why don't we call Comedy Central and try to?  Yeah, try to get him on the show.  I think we said yes to that.  We said yes to a lot of people.  No, we said Steve Carell.  Oh.  Yeah, he's funny too.  Steve Carell?  Yeah.  All right, we got to get out of here. 
[03:53:30]  We really got to do this interview.  And guys-  Book Colbert!  Thank you for having my friend in today.  I know the guys don't do a lot of porn chicks, but I know he's a big favorite for me.  And it was nice.  Cityscape.  Anari Vox, yes.  But thank you guys.  I appreciate it, man.  She was very lovely.  Yeah, I really like it.  And I want to thank you for setting up Rule 57 for my comic performance in the morning.  Bang up job, man.  Thank you.  By the way, can you tell her it was nothing personal?  Because I don't want to start anything.  What?  She asked for a picture.  I was like, ugh, I don't want a picture.  Why?  Because I always look, like, stupid.  You don't.  I look so, like, I swear to God, over the years, I look at me with, like, a picture of the 
[03:54:00]  porn star.  I look ridiculous.  Why?  You're very handsome.  You're a good-looking guy.  But I'm like, you know, this is me showing a little bit about myself.  I just, I feel, like, awkward and just goofy.  Yeah.  Well, you're a fucking, you're like a nine.  Yeah, I know, but-  I mean, you're a six with a comma in his bank account.  I was trying to be cool, too, because she goes-  I wasn't listening.  I was trying to be cool, and it was I.  And she goes, can I have a picture?  I'm like, ah. 
[03:54:30]  And I see the camera guy, and I go, well, you got a lot of pictures when we were walking,  right?  Oh.  I didn't mean that in a bad way, because I know she's a friend of yours.  I just wasn't, I haven't slept in two, it's a whole thing.  All right.  I'm just feeling weird today, so.  There was nothing personal there.  We've been a bit shy.  And then we had an awkward conversation, and Ben called me out on that, and then she laughed,  so if you see her at Cityscape, it was nothing personal.  Okay, no, I'll tell her.  She's actually, I think she's very appreciative that you guys hollered with us.  When I'm having lunch with Kobe, I'm having lunch with Kobe in a couple of days.  Do you want me to say something to him?  Yes, absolutely. 
[03:55:00]  No, we don't want you to.  Yeah, like I'm really having lunch with him.  Why is that out of the, Jesus, man.  That's not out of the realm of possibility.  He's not fucking Dan Rather.  Hey, we're going to leave with, we're going to do this one more time.  We only played it once.  Give him a little more Jim Noren, because you've got huge ratings for Lucky Louie.  3.8.  And by the way, thank you to Opie and Anthony for helping me promote.  That is certainly a part of those numbers, believe me.  Enough thank yous.  Absolutely.  God is turning into a maudlin fucking thank you fest.  Are you kissing our asses?  No, I am being, ugh.  I am being very, uh... 
[03:55:30]  Mantown merchandise tomorrow.  No, I'm being, you have to...  Yeah, this is like the end of the Mantown show.  You have to be appreciative.  I don't like to, you know, it's like when your friends do nice things.  It's appreciative.  Either shut your mouth or open it and put my cock in it.  How about both?  That's, that's it.  You're right, you're lucky to have me.  There's no other thank you.  No, I kind of like when Jimmy goes down this road.  Oh, I thought we should...  When Jimmy goes down...  It's happy Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So continue, Jimmy.  Yeah, it could last for minutes.  No, continue.  It's happy Jimmy. 
[03:56:00]  Well, I don't take my, uh...  Shut up.  Oh!  We leave you with Jim Norton on Leno, his fourth appearance.  What a cock.  Oh, you fucking...  You're lucky to have me.  What?  What?  What?  There it is.  We leave with this today.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Alrighty.  My next guest, co-star of the new HBO series Lucky Louie.  His new DVD, One Night Stands, is in stores right now.  He's also on the Opie and Anthony Show, the hottest show on satellite radio during the week. 
[03:56:30]  A huge show every Monday through Friday.  Next time, please welcome Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Thanks, everybody.  How are you?  I am, uh, I am in a really good mood.  I, uh, I saw my parents yesterday.  And, uh, they're supposed to come over at noon.  Why do parents do this?  My phone rings 820 in the morning.  Hi, we're three blocks away. 
[03:57:00]  And you gotta let them come over.  What are you gonna say?  Uh, could you wait a couple hours?  I have to hide $4,000 worth of pornography.  And you can never get it all hidden, so now my mother wants to borrow Blacks and Blondes  because she thinks it's a Mickey Rooney film.  I, uh, I occasionally, uh, watch, uh, adult films, you know, whenever I'm awake.  And, uh, I tried to emulate what I saw, so I shaved everything. 
[03:57:30]  Everything.  When I'm nude, I look like a tall infant.  I even sound like one.  When I make love, I go, ha, ha.  I am, uh, I'm vocal in bed, uh, to answer your questions.  Love to talk dirty, uh, but only with a lisp. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, get on your knees.  There's a fine line.  When you're talking dirty, there's a fine line between sexy and horrendous because what  works in real life does not work, uh, when you're trying to be dirty.  Like, being polite is acceptable, but in bed it's kind of a vibe killer.  You know, if a girl's like, oh, I like that.  Hey, thanks a million.  Sarcasm.  I love sarcasm in real life, but in bed it wrecks everything.  You know, you're with a girl, she's like, oh, that feels good. 
[03:58:30]  Does it?  I couldn't tell because I'm stupid.  Everything in life is tone.  It's not what you say, it's how you say it.  That's my problem when I approach women.  I try to be fun and endearing, but it comes off as menacing and unpleasant.  Like, I'll see a group of girls and I'll walk over.  Hey, it looks like the party's over here.  And if you don't believe me that tone is important, walk up to a woman pushing a stroller and go, nice baby. 
[03:59:00]  It's so fun to irritate somebody with a baby because they're so easily bothered.  I love walking up to them.  Hey, great baby.  Can I pick it up?  Come on, I'll bring it back.  Let me touch him.  He looks soft.  You ever have a parent get mad at you when you make a gender error about their stupid infant? 
[03:59:30]  There's no way to tell.  It's this big wearing a one-piece outfit, that awful asexual bonnet.  Fat, featureless face.  It's the ultimate poker face.  It gives away nothing.  So I'm trying to be polite.  I'm like, ah, how old is he?  And the mother freaks out.  She is six weeks.  She's a she. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, I want you to put a thong on her and bring her back when she's 18.  I said 18 to make that joke slightly more acceptable.  You ever have like, you ever try to use your sense of humor like on a date and it just gets  nothing and you feel like a silly goose?  I was out with this girl.  She's looking through my glove compartment and she finds condoms and she's like, what are  these for?  So I'm trying to be funny. 
[04:00:30]  I'm like, they're going to save your life tonight.  Believe me.  How else do you respond to that uncomfortable question?  I don't know.  I never use them.  I just put them on my fingers and act wacky.  For the record, I hate condoms.  Hate them.  But, you know, I use them if she says something.  If a girl doesn't notice, it's potluck. 
[04:01:00]  Come on, healthy.  You ever panic after sex?  I mean, look, sex is a powerful thing, man, because, you know, your mind says if you do  this, you might die.  30 seconds later, your mind goes, and again, maybe you won't.  You ever panic and start noticing things about the person you probably should have picked  up on a little earlier?  Hey, have you been a Haitian male this whole time? 
[04:01:30]  Thank you a lot, everybody.  I appreciate it.  What was that magazine?  Blacks on blondes.  Is that what it was?  I went that down.  That's it.  Hey, you got yourself a TV show.  You got a radio show.  You're shooting a show here in L.A.  Have you moved out here yet?  No.  I actually want to move to L.A., but I bought a place in New York, and I'm not a good decorator.  Like, I'm 37.  I still don't know how to match, like, carpeting with framed kiss posters.  Yeah.  So I have my gay friend helping me, and it's stereotypical, gay people decorating, but this 
[04:02:00]  guy's a genius.  The problem is, gay people are so arrogant when it comes to things like that.  We're sofa shopping, and I find one I like, so I call him over.  I'm like, yeah, what do you think?  And he runs his hand over the back of it, and he's really loud.  He goes, ugh!  The material's too rough.  This is hideous.  And then I realized we had different priorities when sofa shopping.  When I'm buying one, I don't have to wonder what it's going to feel like, mushed into my  face for an hour in a time. 
[04:02:30]  You ever think of those things?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, look, I try to react the same around all my friends.  We had a really uncomfortable moment of, we're hanging out, we're hanging out, and  he sees this very good-looking blonde-haired guy across the store, and he kind of says  to me, you know, you see him?  And he goes, we used to work out at the same gym.  I had him in the shower.  And I kind of wished he wasn't comfortable enough with me to blurt that out. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, I still found myself going, what happened?  Well, Jim, congratulations.  You got your radio show, you got your TV show, you got your DVD.  Give him a hug.  Thank you, buddy.  Hi, I like to listen to Opie and Anthony when I'm feeling blue, just like the pills  Uncle Henry gives me before bed.  They make me feel all tingly down there, and my undies get tight.  Then Uncle Henry stares at me with a stopwatch.  Opie and Anthony! 
[04:03:30]  I wish I could sleep on my tummy.  I wish I could sleep on my tummy.  I wish I could sleep on my head. </pre>
