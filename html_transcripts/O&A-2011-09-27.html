<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a profane introduction from Larry King, describing the show as “disordered” and “fucking bizarre.”  The show immediately launched into a graphic discussion of Nancy Grace’s wardrobe malfunction on *Dancing with the Stars*, detailing her exposed breast and nipple with vulgar commentary from the hosts and Jim Norton.  This transitioned into similarly offensive remarks about Chaz Bono’s appearance and performance on the same show, including speculation on Cher’s reaction to her children’s lives and a debate on Chaz Bono’s gender identity.  A transgender woman, Michaela, then called in, engaging in a lengthy, sexually explicit conversation with the hosts, who examined photos from her Facebook page and discussed her body, surgeries, sex life, and plans to use sex work to fund further procedures.  The segment concluded with a return to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominations, featuring more profane opinions on the nominees and the Hall of Fame itself. A final caller referenced a previous discussion of beheading videos.

The next segment began with a fleeting, unclear mention of Mike McDonald’s voice and an event at the Waldorf Astoria.  The conversation quickly shifted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with the hosts expressing their frustration over Rush’s induction and advocating for artists like Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, and Eric B. & Rakim.  They criticized the Hall of Fame’s displays and discussed the year’s nominees, including Donna Summer and the Spinners, leading to a humorous anecdote about Keith Robinson's fashion sense.  A lengthy debate followed, filled with vulgar language and personal anecdotes, focusing on the merits of various musicians, including Eric Clapton, the Spinners, and Donovan.  A caller provided information about the Small Faces' lineup.  A listener compared the music discussion to sports radio, prompting a tangent about the hosts’ opinions on various sports teams and athletes, punctuated by a call from an angry Red Sox fan. Another caller shared information about a former K-Rock engineer, Steve, highlighting his perceived unfair treatment.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Donovan's "Atlantis," its use in *Goodfellas*, a story about a banana thrown at a black hockey player, and an anecdote about Sean Avery and a homophobic slur. A caller, Eddie, provided a Dallas Cowboys game update, and the hosts discussed rumors about Sean Avery’s sexuality and his reaction to the homophobic slur.

The following segment focused heavily on Sean Avery’s reaction to being called a “faggot” on the ice, contrasting it with his past use of offensive language.  Callers contributed gossip and anecdotes about Avery’s reported personal life and sexuality.  The conversation then shifted to a discussion about the “blackest” sports franchise, with the Brooklyn Nets suggested as a contender. This was followed by an interview with Sebastian Bach, who discussed his new album, the damage to his home from Hurricane Irene, his Broadway experiences, and his time on *Celebrity Fit Club*.  The interview included humorous anecdotes and misheard lyrics.

The show continued with an interview featuring Sebastian Bach, covering his new album, “Kicking and Screaming,”  his clashes with MTV during the grunge era, the impact of grunge on the music industry, the shift to YouTube, the anxieties of making music videos, and a candid anecdote about using music to cope with childhood sexual abuse. He also discussed his touring plans and relationship status, followed by the playing of his album's title track. This was followed by an interview with Michael K. Williams and his mother. The conversation initially focused on Williams' experiences on the show, his work on *The Wire*, *Boardwalk Empire*, and *Community*, and his cell phone reception problems in New York City.  A humorous and detailed discussion about New York City neighborhoods, driving, and experiences with robbery ensued.  A phone call with Williams' mother revealed her strong protective feelings and reluctance to watch him in violent roles, despite her pride in his success.

The segment with Michael K. Williams continued with him discussing his mother's reaction to his *The Wire* role, his family (three children and his mother), and his work on *Boardwalk Empire*.  The interview was abruptly cut short, causing friction with the hosts and staff, especially Jimmy. The ensuing discussion covered Who Kid's unusual radio show, Lil Wayne's fashion choices and potential feud with Jay-Z, Guns N' Roses' Hall of Fame prospects (with Sam Roberts giving away concert tickets), and the hosts’ and staff’s collections of memorabilia, culminating in Roland's hyperbolic expression of distress.  The segment concluded with promotion of Sam Roberts' "Jocktober" event.

The show ended with the hosts announcing the end of the broadcast, congratulating Matt from New York on winning Guns N' Roses tickets, and mentioning one host's attendance at a Radiohead concert. They promoted their Facebook page and the upcoming Ron and Fez show, concluding with an unclear reference to "the virus."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, it's Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You got it, guys.  Hey, it's Larry King, welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show,  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah! The place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on it, right?  Yeah, a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about,  but certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, 
[00:00:30]  but I'm still proud to intro it.  The show is so disordered.  Oh, shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this.  Well, then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio,  so shut the fuck up.  Who else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this,  by the way, one of the highlights of my career,  the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:01:00]  Are you a little maggot?  You make me want to vomit!  Sorry, but we've all been puking thanks to Nancy Grace and her nipple slip. 
[00:01:30]  It's the big story today.  That's your entertainment story.  Yeah, it's your biggest story of the day.  I was going to say, who gives a fuck that the European economy is collapsing? 
[00:02:00]  This is the big story.  Nancy Grace and her nip slip.  Yeah.  Dancing with the stars.  Yeah, she was doing a little dance number, and then when she finished up,  I swear, if you see this on video, it's less than a second long.  Oh, really?  It's so fast.  Yeah.  But, of course, it's been immortalized.  The Janet Jackson thing was way less than a second.  This was less than the Janet Jackson thing. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, it was?  Yep.  Okay.  Less than the Janet Jackson thing.  Yeah, but with the internet and the freeze frame, it's there for everyone to see.  The still pic is blown up.  It's huge.  And look, I'm not going to turn down a nipple, but this thing is fucking disgusting.  It's just the way it's sticking out, kind of wrong.  Well, because, you know, everything is soft and being held up by wires and shit.  Let me say it looks like a bank robber when they pull a stocking over their head.  It just kind of mushes everything around. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Her tit doesn't look like her nipple should be there.  No.  She's got a lot of padding in that bra, I guess.  What the fuck?  It's just support, man.  Yeah.  She's got, like, cutlets and wires and all sorts of crap.  Because she does have big boobies.  I guess maybe they were attractive back in the day.  But that's a disgusting nipple.  I like it.  Come on, Jimmy.  That's a big, dark areola.  Shoot out.  But the whole area is mush.  Tit mom.  Yeah.  That's what they're calling it.  You know, if she took that top off, that breast would be really close to her belly button. 
[00:03:30]  It's a disaster.  It's a disaster.  But you like it because it's dark?  I like large, dark areolas.  Or light.  I like big areolas.  Even on Nancy Grace, though?  I fucking, I'm looking at her face while we're looking at this.  And she reminds me of the guy who was shooting at Steve Martin in The Jerk.  Remember that?  He's been in a million movies.  I don't remember his name.  That's who her face looks like.  She's fucking creepy.  I like the fact that part of her tit, the other tit, is actually coming out and it's under her arm. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  On the other side of her dress.  It's like the tit fat.  It's just gravity.  Just trying to find a way to escape.  She's a disaster.  Yeah, I hate Nancy Grace.  Really, but the nipple slip overshadowed Chaz Bono's stellar performance.  I didn't watch.  I didn't either.  I just saw the clip when you guys were playing it earlier.  It just looked like a freak.  I want Chaz to win.  She's probably going to win.  She.  Yes, that's right.  She.  Because she doesn't have a penis. 
[00:04:30]  She.  Yeah.  She's still a she.  If she committed to the penis, I would call her a he.  Then you would have to.  Out of respect.  You would have to.  The beard and all that, that's a good start.  But you still have a vagina.  You are a she.  Yeah.  With a beard.  Which means you're a circus lady now.  And then doing that whole woman dance.  You turn yourself into a circus lady.  She's dancing like a chick anyway.  She can't get that girly part out of her to look masculine moving.  Especially dancing.  Just looks like a big burly girl. 
[00:05:00]  Let's say you're dancing.  Dancing.  Hey, Tony.  You're dancing tonight.  Chaz Bono.  Dancing the quick step.  Chaz Bono and his partner, Lacey Swimmer.  His partner.  How funny is this?  He's combing his hair.  Like a freezer.  Oh, no.  This is so stupid. 
[00:05:30]  Who watches this?  There is.  Oh, wow.  That's like dancing with a truck tire.  Yeah, yeah.  Chaz Bono's not moving at all.  No.  This lady has to drag that fat piece of shit around the dance floor.  That would be funny if you were one of the judges and you didn't realize your mic was on and you just said that.  Make it after all. 
[00:06:00]  It's a marital amor theme.  Yeah.  Make what?  A penis?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Throws her tit in the air when she's done with the song.  Don't need that.  Oh, they're doing a little shit. 
[00:06:30]  Do you think that...  Very fifties looking.  Cher watches this and is happy that Chaz Bono goes,  That is my little girl.  Just looks...  I don't know.  She watches her kids and just looks at the utter failure that were her two children.  One that wants to be a girl.  One that wants to be a guy.  Oh, does she really have a...  Well, Elijah...  Elijah Blue, I think, finally figured his shit out.  Elijah Blue.  But she should be yelling at her vagina when she gets up in the morning because it fucking popped out some weirdos. 
[00:07:00]  Her and Sonny made some fucking, yeah, really mentally...  No, both aren't Sonny, brother.  That's Greg Allman's kid.  Oh, that's right.  And you know Greg Allman's a man.  Oh, so it's Cher's fault.  That's why I said she should yell at her vagina.  Oh, right.  Because she had two shots at it with two different guys and had two weirdos pop out.  Is he gay to her son, too?  I don't know.  In the early days, yeah.  He went through a really strange stage where he was wearing dresses and stuff, but I don't  know if that was for his art or not, so I don't know. 
[00:07:30]  Elijah Blue Allman.  Yeah.  His art?  They do that for, like, art?  Well, he's been a musician his whole life, and he kind of went artsy with the whole fucking  thing, sort of.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing beats that.  And I love that they say his partner with the chest.  Chaz Bono?  His partner.  Really?  Yeah, we don't have to accept that.  It's a he.  Sorry.  No, we don't.  It's a disaster. 
[00:08:00]  Look at this old photo.  I know you can't because it's radio, but it's Cher from probably late 70s, maybe 1980.  1980, that was maybe.  Giant hair.  And Chaz looks more like a boy than Elijah Blue, who has both his hands under his chin  in that, like, that I'm a Hollywood child star.  Being precocious.  Yes.  She looks like Tommy Shaw, Chaz.  And she, yes.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  And Chaz is the complete tomboy in that picture, and we all know how that ended up.  And Elijah.  Huh?  She looks like Tatum O'Neill in Bad News Beers.  A little Tatum O'Neill.  Bad News Beers.  Bad News Beers.  Bad News Beers.  Tired.  Someone's tired.  Someone's sleepy.  Yeah, that's just a problem, family.  No.  Sonny's skiing into trees.  I think Cher has.  Did it on purpose.  Yeah.  That daughter is going, oh, shit.  I think Cher has an open mind to the whole thing, probably. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  If you're going to have, like, a mother to deal with, I guess Cher is doing pretty well  with that shit.  You know?  Yeah.  She knows too many people in show business to be shocked by that.  Oh, yeah.  I would imagine a Cher has a huge gay following, too.  So, you know, it would be smart of her to kind of accept her own daughter.  Wouldn't it be funny if she was like, because she literally, she's like Diana Ross.  She's one of those people that, like, gays love, because she's, you know, she's kind  of a diva.  Wouldn't it be funny if everyone thinks she's open, but she's just really this homophobic,  anti-gay monster? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, sure.  Oh.  It's like, of all the people you wouldn't think would be anti-gay, Cher is...  Chaz tries to call and say hi, and she just unloads with a diatribe of fucking sexist  crap.  Where Cher drops the phone.  She drops the phone because she thinks it's catchy.  She's just ignorant.  Yeah.  So there you go.  For your viewing pleasure today, Nancy Grayson, her nipple slip.  I like it, though, man.  I like that big...  Do you?  I really do.  I like a big areola.  Yeah, no, I understand that, but on her, just like a tit was punched. 
[00:10:00]  I like that.  Now more...  You know what, dude?  Shortless pictures of Chaz Bono.  Dude!  It's topless pictures, yeah, of Chaz Bono with the tattoos and fucking...  Yeah.  You can see the scars where they had to pull tit meat out.  You would...  If you didn't know any better, you would say that's a guy.  Sure.  That might have had, like, open heart surgery or something, because the scars are all over the  fucking place, but you would say that's a guy.  What's in the middle there?  A giant gut? 
[00:10:30]  No, no, no, above that.  What?  Right there where Sam's arrow is.  It's just a metal necklace, whatever, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Around its neck.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  You get your tits cut off, you don't make a penis, boom, you go match the hatch.  She looks like Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly.  A little Bob Kelly in her.  Bob Kelly doesn't want to hear.  He looks like Chaz Bono now.  You know what, dude?  Go fuck yourself.  He'll be all tired and cold.  Yeah, yeah, fuck you. 
[00:11:00]  He'd do the soft voice first.  Jimmy, I don't need to fucking hear this while I'm fucking sleeping, you cocksucker.  He's been fucking ornery since he quit smoking.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  You think?  Oh, Bob's going to fucking strangle somebody.  You don't have to tell me.  That's a tough one.  He was telling me when we went away that every day he's almost in a fist fight because he's  can't smoke.  I know.  Every fucking day and his wife is begging him, please, Bobby, not today.  You have a lot to lose.  And he could do it, too. 
[00:11:30]  He's just losing his shit.  I bet Bobby could kick some ass.  Bobby's a fucking, he's a solid, because when I, like Keith Robinson pointed out, whenever  you talk about Bobby being fat, he makes a muscle.  So you think, you concentrate on how big it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't feel Bob's arms.  He's solid.  They're like legs.  I wouldn't want to fuck with him.  They're like legs.  And he's like, got that psycho thing going.  Of course he does.  Yeah, he would fuck you up.  Hey, who would you do?  Nancy Grace or Chaz Bono?  Oh, God.  Bob Kelly.  Sam was going back between the pictures. 
[00:12:00]  If you had to.  Yeah, how are you going to have sex with Chaz Bono?  You have to do Nancy Grace just for the fact that it's got, like, somewhat of tits.  It doesn't have a beard.  You would do it to save the economy.  Who would you do?  Well.  That's a rough one, man.  No, it's not.  It's easy.  You've got to go with Nancy Grace.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You want to fucking look at a beard?  I didn't say I want to do either.  Yeah, but that, oh, God.  How about that guy?  Well, that's, what's his name, Jimmy? 
[00:12:30]  You know.  Oh, Buck Angel, yeah.  And it's amazing that Buck Angel's clit is too big, but I cannot look and see.  Buck Angel makes me uncomfortable to look at.  Like, I'm a pervert, but Buck Angel makes me uncomfortable.  Pervert.  Yeah, from the belly button down, it looks like a dirty girl, and then from the belly button  up, that's a dude.  It's like.  It's fucking weird.  You're going to fucking, you're either going to go, wow, that's a pretty big pussy, I'm  going to go feast on it, or you're going to get your fucking heart set on some dick  and see that. 
[00:13:00]  It's just as odd looking.  Get your heart set on some dick.  Yeah, I really ought to hanker in for some cock.  Buck Angel.  You think Chaz Bono's going to look that manly in another few years when more of this shit  takes effect?  Whatever she's taking?  Not in good enough shape.  Yeah.  Buck Angel.  No, I don't mean it like that, but looking more and more like a guy.  Like Buck Angel, you would swear as a guy.  And Buck Angel looked like a woman.  You ever see Buck Angel's female photos?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Real nice blonde hair.  She was a model. 
[00:13:30]  Model thing.  Wherever the fuck she was from.  Early Buck Angel.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Imagine that if you were dating Buck Angel.  That's sick.  You could kind of see a little...  Pretty girl with a big clit.  I'd be like, no, don't...  What are you doing with the tattoo?  Why?  Why?  You're going bald?  No, don't do that.  I would have hung on for quite a while, though.  What do you mean?  Going to the doctor again for what?  Oh, the goatee.  Really?  Oh, come on.  My friend just started to say something.  My friend...  Yeah.  Steve from Long Island has a great line. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Steve, what's going on, buddy?  Yes.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, well, you know, after watching that Dancing with the Sars show, you know, and seeing  that nipple, it should be called Dancing with Sars or something.  Boo!  Thanks, Steve.  That was Steve from Bayshore?  No.  They were doing a chip voice, whoever it was. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was something.  It was something.  Wow, all right.  Yeah, Chaz is just out of shape, like big, fat, fucking truck driver-looking thing.  Not like that in-shape bucking.  No, yeah.  Chaz will never be in shape.  Yeah.  Ever.  You know what, dude?  I believe in life after love.  You know what, dude?  You call me babe, you got me, I got you, babe.  You know what, dude?  Gypsies and tramps and thieves, dude.  I can't believe any more of your songs. 
[00:15:00]  That's about it.  That's about it.  That's about it, though.  That's about it.  Oh, do you believe?  Do you believe?  Yeah.  Oh, the fucking voice effect.  Wasn't she one of the first ones to auto-tune?  That's what they say.  Yeah.  We can thank Cher for that.  That was well before, like, the auto-tune craze.  Right.  And then there was a dry spell.  Then everyone used it.  Mm-hmm.  Hated that song.  Hated it.  You know what, yeah?  Let's play that for Jimmy.  Oh, no.  You got that, E-Rock?  I'd really rather we didn't.  It's a good song.  On his iPad. 
[00:15:30]  It's a good song.  iPod.  iPhone.  It's catchy.  I don't hate it as much as I used to, but...  Oh, shit.  It's actually good.  Every gay guy right now just started spontaneously dancing.  Exactly.  Oh, yes, Sam.  You mean the two that listen to our show?  Yeah.  Yeah, listen to that.  It was like...  And people were like,  what is that thing that they're doing with a voice?  Oh, it's the thing that everyone's going to be using.  And especially when you can't sing. 
[00:16:00]  Believe in life after love.  Sometimes we share the great veg.  Really?  Because she's an American Indian.  And American Indians are the fucking...  If there's any ethnicity that has a pussy that should be put on a trophy,  it's the American Indian.  Really?  Amazing vaginas.  There's a lot of meat down there, right?  A lot of big pussies, yeah.  That's what Jimmy has said over the years.  Oh, wow.  Never was with an American Indian.  Must be swollen from riding their horse's bareback.  It's all just swollen. 
[00:16:30]  I just bring up something from the fucking 1800s.  Yeah, exactly.  Or maybe it's from squatting on the front of the Mazzola container.  Mazzola, sure.  And they're picking their maze and shoving it up their vagina to hold it.  Yes.  It's lubricated by all that guy's tears by the garbage pile.  I don't know what that means.  I've had a couple of women in my life that I've fooled around with.  And I just like, I know that she's Native American.  And I didn't say it.  And I've asked her nationality and they've said Native American. 
[00:17:00]  And I knew because of their pussies.  And I'm like, I should have said it because I would have seemed like a genius.  Really?  Yeah.  If you guessed the chick's nationality by her fucking vagina, she'd probably want to marry you.  Fuck, let's do that.  That would be a great bet.  That would be a good bet.  Yeah, let's do that.  We're lucky we can get one girl to an event.  How are we going to get girls to show their pussies?  There were more girls last time.  I know.  We're a little happy with that.  Very happy.  Now this. 
[00:17:30]  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  We all live in a yellow.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  I love that.  It's just terrible.  It's great.  I want that as a ringtone.  Makila.  Yes, how are you?  Or Michelle.  Makayla.  Michael. 
[00:18:00]  No, it's Makayla.  You guys met me before in Philly.  You know exactly who I am.  Oh, I remember you.  Yeah, yeah.  We actually met you?  Hey, Jimmy.  What's going on, boyfriend?  Hi, I remember you.  Yeah, yeah, she came in.  Are you a shim?  A transsexual.  A transsexual with that horrible Philly accent.  Hey, listen, I've improved over the last three years.  I think it's great that these transgenders are actually being showcased.  I mean, it gives me a chance to get my shit out there.  Yeah, what shit do you got to get out there?  I don't remember you.  What?  Do we have a picture of her? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Remember the guy that licked my feet?  The guy that licked your feet.  What was that for?  I know who she is.  I remember her face, but I don't remember the guy licking your feet.  You remember what she looked like?  Yes.  Yes.  Were you turned on, Jimmy?  No, but she was really cool.  She looked good.  I can see my pictures now, baby.  I got me good titties now.  Oh, God.  Where can we see pictures of you?  On my Facebook and on Twitter.  You want to give out your Facebook?  That's up to you, or we could go offline. 
[00:19:00]  I don't care.  It said Michaela the Trans Diva.  Trans Diva.  Ugh.  Trans Diva.  Trans Diva.  We're going to have an open mind, though.  We're going to your Facebook.  Take that railroad back in the 70s.  The old Trans Diva to Denver.  But no, I'm just saying, I think it's great that they're out there.  How do you spell Michael?  It's M-I-C-H-A-E-L-A.  And then the last name...  Michael was in... 
[00:19:30]  Hold on.  All right, hold on, man.  We're trying to...  They're not on Twitter.  We're going Facebook.  Twitter.  What are you doing?  She said go Facebook.  Although we found Trans...  Oh.  Oh, my God.  She looks pretty good.  I know.  You look like Ace Frehley.  Wait, she's tilting her head to...  I didn't say that.  Yeah, Jimmy, why would you say that to her?  I wouldn't.  You have an open mind about this shit.  Why would you say something like that?  You look like every member of Aerosmith.  Well, there you go.  All put together.  All put together.  That's good.  You got the guy gut. 
[00:20:00]  No, you don't.  Stop.  What's going on?  I hate that accent.  Hey, if I could get $25,000, my couple pussy, I'd be running my shit for a few years.  Wait, you still have a dick?  Well, the balls are gone.  I still got, like, a little thing.  It's called a flipper.  A flipper?  I never heard that.  What?  A flipper?  It just flips around so we're inside.  Isn't that what the little toddlers and tiaras put in their mouth when their teeth are not coming in?  Yes.  Right?  A flipper?  It's like the little things they serve as a durs.  Yeah, it's like a little cocktail weenie. 
[00:20:30]  So you got a cocktail Frank dick, but no balls.  Wait, did they really call it a flipper?  It's a snack, not a Frank.  Does it get, I guess it doesn't get hard if you don't have ballies, right?  Is that how that works?  I don't even know.  Even if you wanted to break my balls, I don't have them to break.  So wait, you don't get, do you get an erection or is the lack of testosterone and the estrogen injections preventing you,  I know way too much about this, preventing you from getting erections?  Are you no longer fully functional?  Yeah, what happens to the flipper? 
[00:21:00]  It's really, really, it's taken all in the mind of its own now.  It's actually thinks that the clit, I mean, if they get spit.  That's a man's ass.  What the fuck?  They can't figure out that shit yet.  It's fucked up.  I'm serious.  It's something I've never experienced before.  We're on your Facebook and that's a man's ass.  There's no way around it.  When did you have your balls cut off?  Every married guy just spit on an answer.  2006.  2006.  2006.  Now, I guess you went to a doctor and said, I want my balls chopped off? 
[00:21:30]  Well, yeah.  You have to get through a series of the psychological exams.  Isn't that fucking like in a half-assed job?  It's like, look, yeah, cut my balls off, but, you know, leave the dick.  Well, now it actually helps with the estrogen.  It actually helps the estrogen when you get injections that you don't have.  But I also imagine you got to keep the dick part because that's sensitive, you know?  But you don't have a hole.  You're going to have some pleasure.  What?  They need that to make the any. 
[00:22:00]  To make the vagina.  They make it out of the penis.  Yeah, I get my vagina.  I'm going to be like, holla.  I can't wait.  Oh, I'd be like holla, too.  Yeah, we all would be hollering.  Can we see your pics?  We're looking at your pics.  There's one right now.  Some of them are old.  Some of them are new.  The one we're looking at now is like, that one's brutal.  That one is just downright brutal. 
[00:22:30]  All right, keep going.  That one's not.  This is pure honesty.  That one's okay.  The one before it was brutal.  Let me see the one before.  I was looking at Joe Namath's picture.  Hold on.  I'm trying.  You still are.  That's not a particularly good shot.  The one you're holding.  You look like every hairband.  Guy in a hairband from the 80s.  Yeah, you look at one of the Ramones in this one.  I don't like the one where the picture is blurry in the back because you kind of have  the duck lip face, which is not a good look for you. 
[00:23:00]  But the next picture is not bad, though.  Let's take a look at the next one.  That's not bad.  She looks like Neo from The Matrix.  So basically, what you're thinking is I'm like Arrow Tranny, right?  Well, the one picture is just a woman wouldn't look good with that face.  Right.  The second picture, you almost look like a female.  I'll be honest with you.  You're laying on a hardwood floor with a black shirt on.  I would be fooled by that photo.  Just that photo right there, I would definitely.  No problem. 
[00:23:30]  They're getting, I mean, they're not big.  Are they shrinking?  All right, let's go to the next picture.  Let me reach Voss size.  Stop.  What's this one?  You got a pole in your living room?  What is that?  Oh, yeah, I got a stripper pole.  I got one of those, like, portable poles.  I used to turn and strip and do my little theme song.  Yeah, I'm actually pretty good at it now.  That's great.  Dick rubbing against it.  The flipper.  The flipper.  The flipper gets stuck on the pole and you can't slide down anymore.  What?  I'm having a time in my life now.  Are you? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, I'm actually fucking around with straight guys.  There's some guys that are a little curious.  No, they're not straight.  Yes, they are.  Hey, hey, hey.  If you got a flipper, I don't know how straight they are.  Yeah.  Do they suck your flipper or no?  Hey, McKellar.  No, they lick it.  I want them to lick it like a clitty and then, you know, I suck them off and then they blow  load.  What?  They lick it like a clitty and you suck them off and they do what?  And then they blow load on my back.  The Philly accent is the worst part of this whole thing. 
[00:24:30]  It's horrible.  It's only the accent that bothers me.  Not what you're saying.  Not the flipper penis.  Not the fucking, the duck lips in that one picture.  It is only the Philly accent.  Yeah.  I was talking about fucking cock and I got excited.  Fantastic.  Let's go to the next picture.  What's going on?  You want to lick my flipper?  That's cool.  What do you think of that one, Gene?  I'll let you flip around with it.  That's, uh, it's in between the first two.  Like, it's not.  Do you smell like a man?  Of course. 
[00:25:00]  No.  How do they figure that shit out?  Do you smell like a man?  No, it actually smells like shrimp sometimes.  Like when I, like, you know.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What, what smells like shrimp?  Well, no, I, I, well, now it's like when I, sometimes when I sit and like I cross my  legs, sometimes I get like a little zinger, like a little, like it's a weird feeling.  It's like a zing and like, it kind of like comes out like this clear stuff, like KY and  it kind of.  Oh, you're still making, your prostate is still making like semen, but you don't have any 
[00:25:30]  balls to make any fucking sperm cells.  So it just fucking drips out.  Well, when I get a little excited, yeah.  It's like pre-com, yeah.  Out of the flipper.  The flipper kind of leaves.  Here comes the pre.  Look at this thing, it flips around.  That's why I call it a flipper.  So, you know, I'm playing around.  Yeah, we get it.  So wait, in that picture, you're laying on your stomach.  Sam, please.  Try to enjoy the photo shoot.  That was two years ago. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I was going to say, you look like you're, you're probably more feminine in the last  one we looked at, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  Yes, the chrysalis or pupa.  What grade would you give her, Jimmy, as far as that world goes?  Come on, Jimmy.  Give me a go on.  I, as of right now, probably give her a seven.  I mean, from that last picture, not that one, but that one, I mean, that's, you know,  if you didn't know, you'd go, yeah, she's a cute girl.  I mean, you wouldn't, I'm not saying that you'd go, look, I'll leave my wife for her, 
[00:26:30]  but you'd go, yeah, if I was single, maybe, sure, I'd like to flip her.  I mean, just take her out.  Does she have a passing grade?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, I think as far as that world goes, you do get a passing grade.  I would definitely not know.  And I usually have pretty good radar for that, but I would not, looking at that photo, even  though I do know, it's still like I have to make myself see that, oh, okay, that's genetically  not a female.  We got naked pictures of you?  I've taken a few husbands.  Huh?  I think we got naked pictures of you.  What year did we meet you?  Oh, you guys met me, let's see, in Philly, it was, if I'm not mistaken, I think it was 
[00:27:00]  like 2007.  Yeah, that's it.  That's what E-Rock just said.  She was on Kid Chris's show a lot, and I think Kid Chris introduced us to...  He had some good characters that he found.  He did.  Chris is a fucking creeper.  Oh, yeah, I think that's right.  Yeah, yeah, now I remember.  Remember that one monotick, the comic, the...  Yes, he blew us off.  The other guy or something?  The other guy or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sad little child.  Ed McGonigal, right.  Yeah, he was a trick.  But then he blew us off for some reason, because he thought it would be disloyal to go on 
[00:27:30]  our show, and then no one ever heard of him again.  Yeah.  Nah, because he's a piece of shit.  You know what I mean?  I'm loyal.  I'm one of those loyal people, and I like to have fun.  Not loyalty of balls.  Yeah.  Not much loyalty there.  Sold those things right out.  Hey, what's going on?  You want to come on me?  Well, if you guys think I'm a seven, I'll tell you what.  You can adopt me as your tranny.  We didn't think you were a seven.  We said you're passable.  I gave you a seven.  Oh, Jimmy did?  Yes.  I'm very kind in that world.  So what?  She'll go to a hundred. 
[00:28:00]  Jesus.  Come on.  Seven.  Hey, seven's better than a freaking three.  Michael with Michaela, whatever.  Michela.  Michaela.  Michaela.  Maybe you were just gay.  No.  I'm having fun being a girl.  I like going to play shopping, and I like...  Well, maybe you were just gay.  Why do you have to do all this?  You could have just been a gay guy.  Well, I was born except for a chromosome anyway, but that's besides the point. 
[00:28:30]  I was giving up a birth for adoption.  Now, yeah, I'm like a Discovery Channel way.  Oh, you had like both sets of genes in you?  No, the ball sack wasn't closed all the way.  What?  What do you mean wasn't closed all the way?  Well, you know, like when babies are born, like intersex, they're born like, you know,  like the doctor's like, well, it's got his testicles, but the testicles are still up  there, so let's close this ball sack and drop the ball and pull out the penis and give 
[00:29:00]  the kids testosterone shots when they're eight years old.  Well, your penis wasn't pulled out yet?  I kind of was like stuck, you know, like in between, like coming out and saying, like...  What do they have to do?  Just plug your ears and nose and blow into your mouth.  Watch them come and pop.  All right, hurry up.  All right, hurry up.  All right, hurry up.  All right, hurry up.  All right, hurry up.  All right, like the turkey suffer.  Like they sing on the freaking chicken when it's done, right?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  The first sneeze and here it came.  Wow.  Jessica's on the line with you.  Jessica, what's the problem? 
[00:29:30]  Hey, listen, guys.  The problem is not the puking sound or anything like that.  The problem is the Philly accent combined with the puking sound.  I'm trying to eat my bagel over here.  Aw.  Yeah, you're...  Put the bagel down your mouth.  Oh, shit.  That's not noise.  Make it fun of my accent.  What's the world?  I'm from Philly.  I could have been from Brooklyn.  Hey, catfight here.  Come on now.  Yeah.  Come on now.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right, wait.  We're looking at naked pictures of you now.  We actually have the...  Thank you, Jim.  We should have her bagel unlocked.  All right, thank you. 
[00:30:00]  Let's...  I think I remember this.  What is that?  You have to zoom in on the flipper.  Yeah.  We're looking at your flipper, I think.  And you've got to...  Actually, when I pulled it out for the crowd, I remember that now.  All right.  Thank God I didn't...  Oh, boy.  Flip that shit.  Now we've got to...  Yeah, Sam's got it all on the side.  He doesn't know how to make the picture go left.  There we go.  That is creepy.  Wow, I was thinner back then.  That's all I can think of.  I'm standing behind you holding my camera, and I'm like, I wish I was that thin again.  What is that?  That's got to be a disease trap. 
[00:30:30]  This looks like a train wreck.  What is that?  I think she's holding the dick with those two fingers trying to hide it.  How thin was I?  Fuck.  You're pretty thin.  That's all I care about.  Zoom in.  Zoom in on that thing.  Zoom in more.  Zoom in on it.  See if you can zoom in, because I can't figure out what the fuck is going on there.  It looks like it's a ball bag that they just lit up the middle.  I'm sliding the penis a little bit.  Where's the flipper?  Behind your two fingers.  Do you have anywhere to put, like, a dick? 
[00:31:00]  No, it kind of, like, pushes back up in me now.  Sorry.  I think it's got to bend me now.  I don't know.  That just looks like it.  It doesn't smell good.  That looks like problems.  I can wear a bikini now.  Oh, really?  Congratulations.  Yeah, I don't have to tape.  I can't.  No.  No, I don't have to tape or nothing.  All right.  So you're...  I don't know what to say.  I don't know what that is.  Well, it takes, like, six to seven years anyway.  You know, they don't just give you estrogen in two years. 
[00:31:30]  So, okay, now you're a girl.  I mean, it takes, like, six or seven years for the estrogen to take effect and depends  on how masculine you were before that.  Are you happier now than you've ever been?  I'm probably the happiest I've ever been since I was a kid.  I don't comprehend that, wanting to lose your...  Like, but you want to lose your dick.  Oh, I went out of the clothing when I was five years old, trying to cut it off with a nail  clipper.  Ugh.  You're trying to cut your own dick off with a nail clipper?  I told my mom I didn't belong there. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  All right, now I'm just depressed.  Is that what it feels like?  It's just wrong?  It's in the way?  Yeah.  It's wrong.  I feel like I'm vaginally challenged.  You know how, like, people are physically challenged?  I'm vaginally challenged.  I never had penis.  I always had pussy envy.  I used to look at the Sears catalog, and you know how, like, when you guys were jerking  off to the frickin' patent pictures, I was sitting there like, why can't I look like  her?  Man, I wish I looked like her.  Pornos never did anything.  It just made me more depressed.  Well, you could see a nice vagina and be like, why can't I have that? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, it's like, you know, Martian, but I'd rather be, you know, an earthling instead  of an alien, you know what I mean?  Well, no idea.  It's kind of like you're displeased.  You're confused.  You know, I'm not confused.  I know what I want.  I know what I want to do.  Well, we are.  That's like, sounds a little mental.  You're confused, but I'm not.  Nah, good for you.  Whatever makes you happy.  Please, believe me, I'm probably the happiest I've ever been.  Like, you know, I make occasional dates with fellas every now and then, you know? 
[00:33:00]  Fellas.  Fellas.  Fellas.  Did you ever go out with girls when you were growing up?  Well, yeah, I mean, to know what's like this, look, when you're a boy, you have to go out  with a girl.  I mean, listen, I have nothing against homosexuals.  You know, they do what they want to do, but I don't think two men having sex is like good  looking.  I mean, at least one of them has to have long hair.  But I think that's what you're doing.  That's where I'm confused. 
[00:33:30]  You're still kind of a guy, no?  Yeah, you're like a dick or something.  No, I'm a nothing guy.  I don't understand this.  This is very confusing.  What, do you give up the ass?  Yeah, I give it up every now and then.  Can you say?  Yeah, I love it.  Can you?  All right, wait a minute.  But what about that front area?  Is there a hole there now?  No, but it actually pushes in and, like, I don't know.  Do you accept penises into that thing?  Yeah, about three inches worth.  I mean, they can get the tip in and it just feels like...  It's just kind of push into a bunch of mush. 
[00:34:00]  I think is what she's saying.  Have they tried to do that?  Yeah, I've played around already.  It's really cool.  But see, the main thing I want to do is I want to get breasts first.  I mean, I'm only a 36B that I grew from estrogen.  I want to get, like, these.  So this way I can make some money and then buy a vagina.  You want to look like a real whore.  That'll make a difference.  Hell yeah, man.  How are you going to make the money?  What do you mean, make the money?  Yeah, once you get tits, how do you make money?  Yeah, how do you make money?  Dating?  Sucking dick.  Sucking dick? 
[00:34:30]  Are you really?  You're a Philly enchantress.  Are you going to prostitute yourself a little bit?  Yeah, I mean, what the hell, man?  I need my cell phone bill to take.  Come here, honey.  Give me five minutes.  How much, how much, uh, if you were to prostitute yourself, uh, what would, what would you charge  for a, uh, uh, blowjob?  $100 for an hour?  $100 for an hour?  $100 for an hour?  $100 for an hour.  A little bit of hand action and a little rubby, touchy-feely, and then if you want to do, 
[00:35:00]  you know, a little backdoor action, I'd say $150.  But that's literally the unsexiest description of fucking I've ever heard in my life.  A little touchy, a little touchy-feely, and if you want some backdoor action.  Yeah, an extra $50.  I'm going to walk around the playground.  How's that?  Say it's sexy.  Say it's sexy.  Well, how about a little walk around the playground and you can explore me for an hour and a half,  $150, baby?  No, you don't use playground analogies like, you know, hey, why don't you hang off the jungle gym? 
[00:35:30]  No.  Yeah, walk around the playground.  I'm not a jungle gym.  I'm, I'm like, I don't know what I am.  A jungle chip.  I'm more like the sliding board.  Slide it in, baby.  Slide me a nice one.  You're something.  Like the swing set of something.  See, all of a sudden you're like a sandbox, but you're not, you know, there's no one around  ever.  I don't know.  I'll feel your batting balls.  I'll be your shortstop.  You hear that man voice coming?  I just don't understand.  No, I don't.  I don't understand it, wanting your penis gone. 
[00:36:00]  I don't quite get it.  If the doctor could say, you know what, Mikael, I can give you a vagoplasty today, I'd be like,  all right, doc, let's go.  Vagoplasty.  We should get her.  Sounds sexy.  We should get her with Bobo.  Bobo, I was just thinking that.  God damn it.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Two disasters.  Get her full intercourse with her.  Yeah, she sure could.  We'd have an inch left over.  Oh, yeah.  As long as they wear robbers. 
[00:36:30]  As long as they wear condoms.  Why, Bo?  Oh, what are you, safe?  Bo, what are you, goody gumdrops now all of a sudden?  Yeah.  But I think you would be the problem.  Wouldn't you be more of a problem than the guy?  No, because I'm not going to go through all this and then get a sexually transmitted disease  for being careless.  Patty?  I like to be smart.  No, I mean, I do have a college education.  I mean, I'm not stupid.  I mean, I'm not, like, reckless.  I mean, I am careful.  Cut your balls off.  Yes.  All right, well. 
[00:37:00]  I beg to differ.  That's the best decision I ever made in life.  I'm happier now.  That's good.  I was suicidal.  I tried to kill myself, like, four times.  I'm trying to think of what kind of vehicle to get, and she's going, eh, I'm going to  jump my balls off or not.  That's a little more of an important decision.  Did you really want to cut it off with a fucking, uh, because I've thought of, I have  a skin tag on the side of my head that I would, Tom Papa said I should just take off  with fucking nail clippers.  Let's do it today.  I can't do it.  I'll do it for you.  No, I know you would.  I can't do it.  How big is it?  It's small, but I can't do it.  Oh, that's easy, Jimmy.  I can't do it.  That shit's easy.  I'm afraid. 
[00:37:30]  You won't even feel it.  I can't do it.  I'm afraid.  All right.  Well, we're glad you're doing okay, I guess.  Yes.  Yes.  That suicide shit is real shit, I guess.  No, I don't think that's anymore.  You're happy now, I guess.  I'm happy.  I still just don't understand that world at all.  At all, man.  I'll have to explain it to you sometime.  That's okay.  That's all right.  I've talked to a few, uh, a few of the transgendered gals.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and I just, I don't comprehend the desire to...  To just, to remove your dick.  I don't get it.  I don't, I just... 
[00:38:00]  Fuck.  I can't wrap my head around it, honestly.  Oh, you have to.  I don't feel normal.  You feel normal being men, and I don't feel normal being a man.  I feel more normal being a woman.  That's basically, I guess, the best way to put it.  Okay.  You're happy with your manhood?  I wasn't.  I never was a man.  I'm okay with my manhood.  I'd be happier if it was offensively large.  Well, we all can't have little dreams.  No, my dick is very average, and I would like it to really frighten people.  Why?  Why?  It's supposed to be a beautiful thing. 
[00:38:30]  No.  You want to terrify people, your dick.  Your dick's a weapon.  Remember that.  You were born a man.  Chaz Bowen was born a woman.  Would you guys have sex?  Uh, do you think you'd want to swap?  No, but would you have sex with Chaz?  That's a fair question.  Would you have sex with Chaz?  I'm trying to figure this shit out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I would.  So you would have sex with Chaz because you'd still think she's a girl, right?  No.  I mean, he looks pretty good as a man. 
[00:39:00]  He looks like about maybe like 60 pounds.  He would look a lot better.  I don't really understand.  All right.  He would be more attractive if he lost more weight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, thanks for checking in.  It's been a while, I guess.  Yeah.  No problem.  Good talking to you guys.  Bye, Michaela.  I'll check in some other time.  Okay.  Jimmy, you want her on hold or?  Grab a number.  God bless her.  You want her on hold now?  No, we should be able to keep in touch with her. 
[00:39:30]  The desire to cut your dick off is...  I'll put her on hold for you.  I've never heard that before.  It is just an odd thing, man.  All right.  With nail clippers.  Oh.  There are people who just hate their dicks.  Like, there's enough weird videos like that of people mutilating their dicks.  I just, I don't understand hating your dick that much.  I've been mad at mine for some of the places it's taken me.  But I've never wanted to fucking lose it.  Every once in a while, you'll yell at it.  Yeah.  Come on.  Work already, would you?  Yeah.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, good observation from Bob right here. 
[00:40:00]  You know what, dude?  Hello, Bob.  Hey, Jimmy wouldn't cut a skin tag off his neck,  but he watched beheading videos with a chainsaw?  Well, I didn't say I could take that, though.  I mean, I said that I could see something.  Um, but the guy, the guy yesterday, he called and said he thinks it's an addiction.  So I actually deleted it from my, um, I have, it was in, one of those sites was in my, uh.  Favorites?  In my favorites on my fucking bookmarks. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Wow.  So I just took it out.  It's one of them.  Not the one I showed you.  Why is it something like that in addiction?  Well, a rush, he said.  Like a rush.  So maybe I was looking at it for the wrong reason.  So I'm going to try not to.  That was a good point.  I was thinking of that yesterday.  I couldn't get it out of my head.  It was just one of those, uh, because I kind of looked at it a little bit.  Yeah.  I was like pissed that I looked.  But the guy that actually had his head chopped off at the chainsaw, he was the, the, like,  lucky one.  That had to be instantaneous.  Once that fucking thing hit his neck and all that blood came out.  Yeah.  And then they just, then it's just, you know, getting the job done. 
[00:41:00]  But the other guy next to him is just kind of looking going, yeah.  But the other guy, the other guy looked down and it was really weird.  It was like any guys in that life, like he knew what was coming next.  Like, I don't know if he knew it was going to be the knife.  It wound up being a knife for him, which is much more graphic.  Yeah.  Or if he thought it was the chainsaw.  But he knew he was going to be decapitated.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was just like, it was almost like when a mob got, like when Lefty got called and  he had to go.  Yep.  Pacino, when he puts his rings and stuff in the drawer and he knows it's his time. 
[00:41:30]  Gotta go.  But these guys look at a beheading like that.  Unless they drugged him.  I don't know how the fuck you.  They wouldn't drug him?  Or is there a threat against the family?  I wonder if there's an understanding that if you beg and if you look weak, then the  people who are alive will go after you.  I mean, is there a reason that motivates them to fucking stay brave in the face of that  camera?  He like, the headless body thing is like leaning on him at one point.  He's like, yeah, that guy's leaning on me.  He was tough, dude. 
[00:42:00]  That fucking...  Yeah, put your head on my shoulder.  That face, dude.  That guy just...  Oh, yeah.  Imagine trying to stare that guy down in a bar and you have no idea that he'll eventually  be beheaded and not even be able to be scared down by that.  Like, who fucks with that guy?  That's unbelievable.  That's a tough Mexican.  There are just people who live a certain way and have a certain tough motherfucker that  that I just will never be able to understand.  Can never be fucked with unless you have a chainsaw.  Well, the good news, you're not going to watch that shit or try not to. 
[00:42:30]  Try not to.  I don't think it's...  It hasn't made me...  It really has made me more empathetic and I really believe that, but maybe the guy was  right.  Like, I don't want to watch it for a rush either because that's sick.  Right.  Like, I don't want to look at it, even though I feel sad for the people, but any kind of  a rush you're using it as is kind of...  Yeah.  I don't want to use that shit as a drug.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good point.  I hadn't thought of that.  All right.  We should break, man.  We got Sebastian Bach coming in at 8 o'clock today.  We're 8.30, I think.  Oh, 8.30?  Yes.  And then Omar coming. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Omar coming.  9.30?  Michael K. Williams?  I said I wasn't going to get him to sign anything just because I've met him quite a few times  now, but I just got one picture I had to do it.  Look at you.  That's an addiction.  I know.  That's kind of a rush too, huh?  I got a good one.  I'm like, I got to do it.  Yeah.  But that seems like a good addiction.  I think there could be good addictions.  It's cheap.  I'm sure he's fine with it.  I know.  But then when you see him, it's like, I saw him at the Curbs Your Enthusiasm premiere.  We all sat at the table and ate together. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And I don't want to lose.  And he's like, oh, he's a fanboy.  You're going to pull a fucking Opie with Obama.  You're going to ruin it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to do that.  He doesn't actually call me to tell me he's going to be on Community.  So fuck him.  I'm thinking at this point.  I'm thinking my next Obama dream, though.  Yeah.  We'll be friends because he needs friends now.  He certainly does.  He wouldn't have blown you off like that.  And it's going to be up to me now because he's desperate for friends.  You had him as a friend for a second.  He liked you.  Yeah.  You blew it.  I was a little too needy. 
[00:44:00]  He said, I'll call you.  I'm like, really?  You're going to call when?  That makes me laugh.  I was like, oh, I thought it was a friend.  And I knew while I was dreaming how pathetic that was.  You know how sad that is that you're in the middle of a dream and you know how pathetic  it is and you don't want to wake up because you're going to realize how pathetic it is?  That's very funny.  Obama had some heckler.  It was kind of funny, to be honest with you.  We'll play the audio next.  Blurting out religious crap.  Obama, though, can't improvise at all. 
[00:44:30]  He's terrible.  If you haven't seen it yet, we'll have the audio for you.  But now this.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich. 
[00:45:00]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNN 3 Show.  Oh, okay.  The 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees are...  You ready for this?  There's always some doozies.  You got Guns N' Roses, of course. 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  The Cure.  You ever get into The Cure?  A little too dark, dismal, you know.  I didn't mind a few of The Cure songs.  But Overkiss?  And then Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.  Overkiss?  Fuck the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I fucking hate it.  Put another time in the jukebox, baby.  And finally, Heart. 
[00:46:00]  Heart's been around a long fucking time and had a bunch of hits, so...  Oh, but the fact that Kiss can't get any respect musically, I just hate these fucking fruity writers, man.  Stupid, right?  It drives me, even if you don't like their music, to not acknowledge what they did.  They were influential.  They dressed up and went on stage and sang immature songs.  Yeah, Kiss, well, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is just a joke.  Terrible.  Too cool for the room type of people.  Absolutely.  Although this list is pretty fucking safe. 
[00:46:30]  Guns N' Roses is good, but...  This list is very safe, so...  Those are just the nominees?  That means they might not get in?  Yeah.  Oh, no, the nominees just get in, I guess.  Right?  That's how it works.  Oh, who else is...  No, no, no, not always.  Also, Eric B and...  Good, Rock Kim, nominated before Kiss.  Very relevant to Rock and Roll.  And Rock Kim.  That's good.  Who the fuck's Rock Kim?  I've heard the name a million times.  He's one of the best rappers ever.  Give me a song.  Fucking In the Ghetto is a great song by him.  In the Ghetto.  Let the Rhythm Hit Him.  It's not the fucking...  It's not rock, though. 
[00:47:00]  Fucking...  No.  Most of them aren't rock, though, that are in the Rock and Roll.  They ran out of Rock and Roll, is what it is.  Well, they should have called it the Music Hall of Fame.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because since the start of this, they have been putting in acts that had nothing to do  with Rock and Roll.  Eric B and Rock Kim are very influential in hip-hop, but...  Right.  Where's Rock Kim?  Oh, this is a good thing.  Yeah, this is Rock and Roll.  Phenomenal fucking...  One of the best rappers ever, but it's not the same one in the Rock Hall of Fame.  A bunch of people saying, Kiss is too gimmicky. 
[00:47:30]  And putting rappers in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame isn't gimmicky, or Madonna?  What the fuck are they talking about?  And they were gimmicky, but they were also fucking...  They were just...  The way they did their live shows, they were great, man.  And a lot of their music is great.  They're underrated musically because of their gimmicks, too.  Yeah, I think they should be in there.  How we doing, everybody?  Chicago and the Doobie Brothers are not in, according to Robin Jersey.  What do you think of those two, Baines? 
[00:48:00]  Chicago, absolutely.  They had a million hits.  Eight million hit songs.  With 18 different lead singers.  They were on every single radio station in the 70s.  They're still on.  Right now, someone's playing Chicago out there.  Chicago.  And then Doobie Brothers.  What do you think of the Doobie Brothers?  Well, I don't like the fact that...  China Grove?  They've gone on rerun about taping their music.  But they were in pop culture.  What about Mike McDonald? 
[00:48:30]  Is he in?  Solo?  I can't forget.  I can't forget.  What a sick voice, huh?  Mike McDonald, what that fucking voice is.  A minute, a minute, a minute, a minute.  Where are they holding it?  Is it in Cleveland in the building?  They used to do it in the Waldorf Astoria here in New York.  I had to go to the Waldorf Astoria. 
[00:49:00]  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  You know, because he said that.  You got that he right.  I love that horrid, uncomfortable clip of the news guy trying to do an impromptu impression.  Interesting fact about Eric B. and Rakim, too.  And I can't point the guy out, but on the back of it, I want to say it was paid in full.  There's a picture of them with a bunch of guys.  And one of the guys in that photo, I believe, is the original 50 Cent. 
[00:49:30]  What? Really? There was a 50 Cent?  Yeah, there was an original guy.  A real gangster.  Not that this 50 Cent wasn't a gangster.  He was, but the original one was a small guy that I think carried two guns, and everybody in the ghetto was scared of him.  Yeah?  Everybody was afraid of this guy.  The real fitty.  Yeah.  So just shoot him.  Get him out of the game.  There's a weird air people have about them, which you're right, but they said he would leave his doors unlocked, his car doors, and nobody would touch it. 
[00:50:00]  People just knew that he would shoot you in a second.  That makes sense.  Let me see.  Fitty.  But if you're in that world, wouldn't you just figure out how to get him?  Some people do.  Well, I think somebody did.  Oh, they did?  I think so.  Okay.  Eventually.  And once again, no Rush.  And I'm sorry, but fucking Rush had enough fucking hits to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  And it's rock and roll, and they've had longevity, and a lot of hits, yeah.  Musically, they're very interesting. 
[00:50:30]  They're original.  There's only three of them.  Those guys knew how to play their instruments.  Not many bands know that.  Well, I don't know.  To that level, anyway.  Eric B. and Rock Kim.  Huh?  Grandmaster Flash should be there before Rush and Kiss.  Yeah.  Run DMC is there.  When you look up RU.  Yeah, Run DMC should be in there.  Very influential.  They're Canadian.  Well, maybe they don't want to let them in because they're Canadian.  Just fucking say it's the Music Hall of Fame.  I agree.  And then I'll be fine with it.  I won't complain.  That's just stupid.  But there you go.  There's your nominees.  Guns N' Roses, The Cure, Heart, Joan Jett, and The Black Hearts, and Rakim, right? 
[00:51:00]  Eric B. and Rock Kim.  Eric B. and Rock Kim.  Me and Kenny went there when I was in Cleveland a year and a half ago.  It was uneventful.  I hate that.  Oh, when we were there one day for a gig, and everybody went, I'm like, I'm fucking...  The last thing I want to do is walk around and look at dumb costumes and a drum head  from this band.  It's who gives a shit.  It's like a fucking...  What's the hard rock?  It's a hard rock without the fucking food.  I think the hard rock has better memorabilia. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  If you think about it.  Yeah, I wasn't impressed at all.  And I think what it does...  I think it inspires too much resentment in the people that you're aiming to get in there.  Right.  Because they look at it, and they go, the displays, a lot of them are shitty.  And even the ones that are good, they're like, why is this one not there?  Why the fuck is that one there?  It just brings up too much annoyance.  No Madonna fan is going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame just to see Madonna.  No rap fans are going to go there and walk through just because Eric B. is in there.  So they're trying to expand, is wrecking it. 
[00:52:00]  Donna Summer?  Yeah, the Spinners and Donna Summer are also...  Nominated?  Nominated this year.  Donna Summer is disco.  I guess the Spinners were fucking kind of...  The Chili Peppers.  The Chili Peppers were a while.  It's the Music Hall of Fame, you know.  You're getting caught up in the fact that they call it the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,  but it's obvious it's just the Music Hall of Fame.  Spinners should be in, I guess, the Spinners.  What do they do?  Fucking great tune.  What's the name of their song?  I'm Coming Home is a great song by them.  It was in When We Were Kings.  I'm Coming Home. 
[00:52:30]  I'm Coming Home by the Spinners.  Quickly, before I bite your cheek and face.  I'm not a big...  Keith Robinson's a Spinners fan.  Because he dresses like the fucking Spinners are coming to town in two weeks.  He's a fucking 70s idiot he is.  He likes that 70s look?  Yeah.  He does.  We always tease what an old man he is.  He looks like he should have been in Muhammad Ali's corner.  Yeah.  Like one of Ali's corner guys.  Oh, motherfucker.  I'm a Jerome adult.  I guess you gotta know Keith Robinson to get that.  Keith is too nice. 
[00:53:00]  Keith is a mean guy.  Yeah.  I love him.  He's really a mean ornery.  Yeah.  Give me the Spinners, E-Rock.  You remember this from When We Were Kings?  This was fucking great, man.  Oh, yeah, I do.  They showed them on stage.  Yeah.  They would always do that little dance and stuff.  You'd never feel threatened.  Phenomenal.  When We Were Kings is such a great flick.  Fuck yeah, I remember that.  Yeah.  They got a sweat because they were fucking...  It was, you know, Zaire.  Right.  Outdoor show in Zaire.  They all look shiny. 
[00:53:30]  They'd get done playing a place in the United States and then have to go out and find their own water fountain.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, 60s.  How long?  Yeah.  What was their number one hit?  Where's the music?  Where's the singing?  That's it.  This was the only cut that was in the light.  I guess it's...  Somebody made a bed of it.  We got a bed of the Spinners.  We go to YouTube.  Do we not have the Spinners?  I'm coming home in the light.  I guarantee you just didn't find it.  It was in a huge movie.  There's no way we don't have that. 
[00:54:00]  Someone would want to play that around this joint.  You'd think.  I guarantee we have that.  What are they doing with these music channels?  Hold on.  I think E-Rock probably just didn't find it.  All right.  Sorry.  I take that back.  No, I had the Spinners, but they labeled it as Spinners.  Okay.  Oh.  Well, that's how people like to look at it, though.  It's not the who.  It's who.  Some people will tell you.  It's not who.  Yeah, it's the who.  The who.  That's all we know.  Actually, the biggest one was Scorpions.  It was definitely Scorpions and not The Scorpions. 
[00:54:30]  No, it's The Scorpions.  I know.  That's what everybody says.  Foo Fighters.  The Foo Fighters.  It's not the Foo Fighters.  It's just Foo Fighters.  Foo Fighters can almost get away with it.  You're right.  Turn this up.  I don't like this shit.  No, it's just.  Yeah.  I like this.  Sounds like I could expect the Ron and Fez show to start soon.  It's like a Ronnie B song.  You don't like the tempo of this, though?  This fucking tune is great. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I like it.  It's not your.  No, it's not my cup of coffee with no cream.  It's not your cup of Kool-Aid?  What about Rubber Band Man?  What's their number one hit?  The Rubber Band Man.  That one you know.  Not a thought in my head.  I don't know that one.  The Rubber Band Man.  Not a thought in this chick's head.  The Rubber Band Man.  Not one fucking thought of interest in that head walking down the hall.  Which one?  Left or right?  Left.  All right, turn this up. 
[00:55:30]  Do I know this?  Oh, yeah.  You've heard this.  You had to.  Did it.  Hand me down the walking cane.  Oh, yeah.  What does he mean he's a Rubber Band Man?  What does that mean?  I'm going to guess Bounce Back.  Yeah?  Be that or maybe he just likes to hold money.  Or maybe there's a bunch of paper clips next to him or something.  He worked at Staples.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  They always put the same fucking gaudy suits on and frilly shirts.  And they all had to move together.  They did all the same dance.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Doing their little spins.  They had to learn their spins.  Fucking spin is a badass, though.  I don't know much about him.  Give me one more song.  One more hit.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You know this one.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock got another one?  Yeah, this was massive. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, come on.  This is their disco days.  I forgot this was actually the good ones.  Are they working their way back to you?  In the 80s?  Really?  This is the 70s, isn't it?  I think this was the 70s.  I'll keep working my way back to you, babe.  This reminds me of my dad's Chevy Vega.  You know where there was a fisherman on board?  Don't you really remember cars that you were in as a kid?  Listen to music, yeah.  When songs go on because dumb AM radio was always going. 
[00:57:00]  My mother's Benson and Hedges.  I like the smell of the match when it was lit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The first cigarette drag I loved, and then it was disgusting after that.  All right, so the spinners.  Soul Train, motherfucker.  Going into the Music Hall of Fame.  Is that it?  What other bands were?  They're fucking good, man.  I want to buy the spinners' greatest hits.  You need the spinners, yeah.  Kiss Sam on his mouth.  In that order.  Right.  So this is everybody. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  Donovan.  Donovan.  Before Kiss.  Donovan.  Donovan is like a one-hit wonder.  I know.  He could quarterback, but what's Donovan's song?  The Hurdy Gurdy Man.  Right.  It was one, but he also had another one.  Yeah, that's better than fucking I Stole Your Love or fucking Rock and Roll All Night  or fucking God of Thunder or Cold Gin.  Well.  Oh, these assholes.  Freddie King. 
[00:58:00]  They just try to, they're trying to balance it so the older school guys aren't left out,  which is fine.  Rufus and Chaka Khan.  Chaka Khan is nominated?  The Small Faces, of course, should be in there.  Who are the Small Faces?  I don't know them.  A little Rod Stewart action.  Are they just a bunch of little people and stuff?  The Spinners, Donna Summer, and War.  Who else was in Faces?  Wasn't it?  That fucking singer guy.  You had a little Rod Stewart in there, and then you had what? 
[00:58:30]  Rod Stewart, and then that other guy.  The dude from the Stones, right?  What's his name?  Help me out.  Oh, Mick Jagger.  Mick Jagger, yes.  Was in Small Faces as well.  Was it Bill Wyman?  Ron Wood?  Ron Wood?  Ron Wood, I believe, yes.  I believe that's the answer you're looking for.  Very good.  What year is that band?  1948.  Oh, I thought it was after.  No, that's really.  That was early.  It was post-war.  Before Stones and stuff.  Stones were very influenced by Small Faces.  That was in Before the Stones, though, right?  Yeah, it was.  No.  Oh. 
[00:59:00]  I'm so gullible right now.  I'm very vulnerable when I'm tired.  Two music facts.  Jimmy, you should be more pissed at Donovan getting in before Kiss.  I don't know what Donovan's song is.  Mellow Yellow, right.  Very good stuff.  Yeah.  Donovan did Mellow Yellow.  How's that go?  They called me Mellow Yellow.  That's all I know.  Just what assholes would think that's better than fucking what Kiss can do?  You want to hear Hurdy Gurdie?  Yeah.  This is Donovan, yes.  You know this one.  I'm sure it's fine, but.  In Atlantis.  I'm just mad about saffron. 
[00:59:30]  It's a cool song.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't put this above Kiss, but this is okay.  What's Mellow Yellow?  Is that like Old Yellow Stain from?  Old Yellow Stain.  From the Kane movie?  This comes on the radio.  Do you listen?  Honestly, there's so many.  I have my fucking satellite radio set for just the band's names that come up. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  So I'm fucking rifling through it.  You know, Zeppelin, Sabbath, Kiss, fucking.  I love when you can see what band is playing on each channel.  Oh, yeah.  I haven't done that yet.  Check your settings because you can have it for the song, the station, or the band.  That's fucking cool.  I have it on the band, so I can fucking just see what band is on each station and fucking  show it.  I still can't get our channel in my car.  That's how lazy I am as a person.  You got to call, dude.  It took me a while, but Gary will do it.  I don't know why.  It'll take 15 minutes.  I drive.  I'm like, let me check out the virus, whatever the hell the channel's called these days. 
[01:00:30]  It's a great channel.  And I'm like, fuck, I still don't have it in my car.  I know.  You're like me.  I work for the show.  I don't even have it in my car.  Believe me, I'm going to drive home.  I wish I didn't.  That's not true.  Oh.  Yeah.  Could you give us some hurdy-gurdy?  Yeah.  Which one is this?  Oh.  It is hurdy-gurdy.  Which song is it?  Hurdy-gurdy?  Yeah.  Hurdy-gurdy-man. 
[01:01:00]  Fuck the hurdy-gurdy-man guy.  Oh, yeah.  How much acid was he fucking doing?  It's an acid song for sure.  Yeah, man.  Look at me, Hart and Garty and stuff.  A little known fact.  Yeah, don't hurtie-gurdy.  Adam Levine from Great Neck.  Paul McCartney is the one whispering in Mellow Yellow.  Did you know that?  Oh, no.  These guys would fucking help each other out all the time.  Wow.  What year was that?  How big were the Beatles when this was done?  Extremely.  All right.  Yes. 
[01:01:30]  Groovy.  So, Donovan, this guy is in Four Kiss.  I get why they would, you know, love this guy, but it's just not my name.  No, they're running out of bands.  Everyone knows his name.  Yeah, that's true, too.  They're kind of running out of bands.  They've got to be running out of bands.  Kids should be in.  If you're sitting there going, we should nominate Donovan, I think you're running out of bands.  You know what I wonder, too?  But you also run out of nominations.  And Sabbath took all those years to get in, which is why the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is such an out-of-touch disgrace to me. 
[01:02:00]  And Ozzy said, pull us off the ballot.  They finally put him in because he goes, just fucking pull us off.  He was tired of being rejected by those assholes, and they were ashamed of putting them in.  Yeah.  There was another name on that list.  Can you go back?  Do you know, yeah, right there, the Negro.  Freddie King.  What?  No, the one next to her.  Are we talking about the Spinners?  Laura what?  Laura Nairo.  Oh.  Who the fuck is Laura Nairo?  No, I don't know her.  But she should be there before Kiss and Rush, definitely. 
[01:02:30]  1947 to 1997, she lived.  Was still a teenager in 66 when she recorded a debut album.  And Peter, Paul, and Mary cut And When We Die.  And age 19, Laura played the 67 Monterey Pop Festival.  She sounded like some fucking folky hippie shit.  Who is she?  What are the name of the songs on the side there?  It's going to take Miracle, And When I Die. 
[01:03:00]  How about any of them?  Just hit one of them.  Well, what's her biggest hit?  Can we Google what her big hit is?  Yeah, what's her big hit in the system there?  This is M When I Die.  Oh, she sounds like you rock.  Blood, Sweat, and Tears did this.  Oh, boy, did they do this song.  Tears?  Blood, Sweat, and Tears.  Tears did this song.  Did she write this? 
[01:03:30]  I guess she wrote it.  You ever hear Blood, Sweat, and Tears of this?  No.  Oh, fuck.  I'd hate to get all of them on my shirt, though.  You really like that one.  All right, now give us the Blood, Sweat, and Tears version.  She's kind of sexy.  I wouldn't mind fucking her mouth.  She kind of looks like a tranny.  Well.  You getting into Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Jimmy? 
[01:04:00]  I don't know them, no.  I mean, I know who they are, but.  You like Blood, Sweat, and Tears?  Yeah, you know, the nostalgic, I guess.  That sounded like background music from Midnight Cowboy right there.  Yeah.  Like harmonica.  I'm not scared of dying, and I don't really care.  I like this one better.  Wasn't this guy, didn't this guy get in a little bit of a jam?  Yeah.  Yeah, he got in a little trouble, this guy.  What happened?  Kitty porn? 
[01:04:30]  He may have had a, well, worse than that.  I think he was with a girl that was a little younger than he should have been with.  Really?  Yeah.  Anything in there?  David Clayton Thomas?  Is that who it is?  That's a good song.  Yeah.  She wrote it, I guess.  All right, whatever.  The Small Faces was not Rod Stewart, someone saying.  Get our knowledge right here.  Mark in Jersey. 
[01:05:00]  Mark.  Yeah, no, the Small Faces was Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, and then Marriott left, and  Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood came in, and they changed to the Faces, but they were cool.  Well, it's Small Faces slash Faces in B9.  Then they went back to the originals, so we went to the new originals, and then we just  said, you know, screw it.  We ended up to 11.  Like, why bother?  It was just kind of different sounds, completely different kind of music. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate the knowledge.  Always looking for knowledge.  Is that it?  Knowledge.  I didn't know it was Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or our music break.  Yeah.  Well, you know, big day when they announced the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees.  What did Freddie King do, Ant?  Anything?  Freddie King?  I don't know.  Probably white people stole his music.  Yeah, he's probably a bluesy guy, right?  What's the name of his songs?  Well, it says guitarists ranging from Eric Clapton and Mike Bloomfield to Peter Green, 
[01:06:00]  Jeff Beck, and Carlos Santana have all acknowledged their debt to Freddie King.  Yeah, but who are those guys?  But never paid it.  They acknowledged the debt.  You're no kidding.  But never fucking repaid it.  This guy was probably homeless under a tree somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  But they acknowledge him.  Can I tell you...  How about you pay his fucking cell bill?  Yeah.  Cell bill back in the 30s.  Right.  Can I tell you how fucking boring I think Eric Clapton is?  Even though I acknowledge he's great.  I know he's a great guitarist.  My manager wanted to fucking chop my head off when I said that. 
[01:06:30]  Really?  Because Jonathan goes, yeah, I went to see him and Steve Wynwood.  I'm like, I'd literally rather watch your shoes alone in a room than those two.  You fucking bore.  Yeah, you don't like Clapton.  Why don't you like Clapton?  Fuck him!  He was in like a million bands.  I know, and I know he's great.  Layla!  You don't like some of the old Cream songs?  I'll still listen to Layla.  Yeah, they're decent, and Tears in Heaven is obviously a very moving and great song, 
[01:07:00]  but I just think he's a bore.  Yeah.  And I know people hate me for that, but I think he's a bore.  As we look at a video that has 21 million views.  Without a doubt, he's fucking massive.  Yeah.  Most overrated song ever.  Is this the fast version?  Yeah, he slowed it down.  That's right.  Unplugged or something.  He knew how to play the guitar.  Oh, he's great. 
[01:07:30]  Great guitarist.  Get to it already!  Oh, that's the record.  Fuck yeah!  That's a famous goddamn riff right there.  Come on, Jimmy!  And watching Eric Clapton play it and shit. 
[01:08:00]  Fuck yeah!  That's kind of cool.  I got a little goose bumps there.  That's a great call.  Sounds great.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  All right.  This sounds good.  Live.  It's good.  I never saw Eric Clapton.  All right.  I've seen most of him. 
[01:08:30]  I never saw Clapton, man.  I would love to see Clapton.  I still think he's boring, but I was wrong about that, so that does sound very good.  That just sounds great.  Live like that, too.  You really think he's boring?  Tremendously.  I'd rather fucking wash these tissues for two hours.  But I do.  That sounded very good.  Fuck yeah, man.  What's another one of those big songs?  I mean, you know, I know I'm probably killing them, but I shouldn't.  What do you got?  Yeah, cocaine, of course.  I always hated this, too.  That was an old video.  This only has 17 million views. 
[01:09:00]  That's it.  That's it.  It reminds me of Eastside Dave.  17 million views, and it has 717 dislikes.  Out of 17 and a half million, a lot.  You can't listen to that, Jimmy?  That he's just picking away?  I don't hate it.  I don't even like this, though.  But this is self-serving.  He's obviously a great guitar. 
[01:09:30]  All right, we get it.  Yeah, but just skip to it.  This is why he's boring today.  Should have put a bunch of his guitar strings in front of his windows.  And you almost tripped on that because my God just didn't want to say something.  I know, I know.  You're right.  It's a hell of a piece of shit. 
[01:10:00]  It's a hell of a piece of shit.  You're in a big arena watching this shit.  Yeah.  Those are hippies.  This is probably like 74.  That's a little later.  Well, if you want to hang out, you've got to take her out. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  Damn.  Fuck, yeah.  Fuck him.  Yeah, fucking Clapton.  Yeah, this is like Clapton in the 80s.  Okay.  Was it really?  Was that 80s Clapton?  God damn, really?  I'm seeing some mullets and shit.  And cream and stuff like that.  I believe you.  I'm saying I don't think he doesn't belong in the hall.  Of course he does.  How about, what's a big Steve Winwood song?  I wanted to fucking smash Jonathan for that.  Steve Winwood.  Higher Love.  That song fucking blows. 
[01:11:00]  You don't like Higher Love?  No, that's what I do.  What's wrong with you?  Get it?  Higher Love.  Higher Love.  This was a massive hit for Steve Winwood.  Oh, it fucking blows.  Thank you.  You didn't like this?  No, I didn't.  I'm not a dentist.  It just fucking stinks.  You're the only person that doesn't like Clapton. 
[01:11:30]  No, he bores me.  But I acknowledge he's very good.  So I don't want anybody to call me up.  Oh, you don't know music.  I just, I acknowledge.  I don't like it.  Look at how 80s this video is.  Oh, yeah.  He's with his skinny little tie dancing.  Stupid hairdo.  Yeah, he's got that.  You know why his name is Steve Winwood?  Because he blows.  Yeah, I know he did.  This is fucking horrendous.  It was a massive hit for him.  Brother Joe's on the line.  Hey, Joe, what's up, brother?  What's going on, man? 
[01:12:00]  What about traffic?  Anything but traffic?  Steve Winwood sang Leeds of that band.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, wow.  Traffic with Steve Winwood, right?  Oh, spark of high-heeled boys.  Right.  He got stuck in them.  Traffic rock.  Dear Mr. Fantasy.  Hell, yeah.  I remember that one was a good one, too.  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of songs that were great.  And then he got into the 80s and made a few hits that were considered pussy songs.  But, you know.  Well, same thing happened with Phil Collins.  So, whatever.  Phil Collins. 
[01:12:30]  He was Genesis, you know.  Do you like Joe?  I'm sure you do as a guitarist.  But you like Clapton, right?  Clapton, you know what, man?  He was highly overrated as a guitar player.  I think Peter Frampton kicked his ass, actually.  Wow, okay.  Peter Frampton was a much, much more well-rounded player.  Clapton was a great blues player.  You know, in his day, like with John Mayle and all the really old stuff.  And Cream, he kicked ass.  But after that, I was like, you know, same thing.  You know, I mean, he went wimp.  He went where the money was. 
[01:13:00]  Thank you.  So, he was overrated.  I'm not crazy.  Oh, no.  Clapton was definitely overrated.  Like I said, I honestly think, like, Peter Frampton, who came for, like, the same,  approximately the same time, was just a thousand times the guitar player Clapton  never was.  Took a different direction and then put that big tube in his mouth, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I detect, it's amazing how famous that live album is.  And I hate it.  Frampton comes alive, huge.  I hate it.  Really?  The whole thing.  It was a double album.  I remember my Aunt Kerry had it. 
[01:13:30]  Giant, yeah.  And you open it, and there was a picture of him in the middle doing something.  That just drove me nuts.  Yeah, you could clean your pot seeds on it.  The oldest stuff, like his first few records, Frampton's Camel, Win the Change, the stuff  before Frampton Comes Alive came out, was actually the better stuff.  And I guess everybody knows he played with Humble Pie as well, back in the early, early  day.  And The Herd before that.  And before that, it was The Thamesman.  The Thamesman and then the Originals.  I love that fucking part. 
[01:14:00]  The new Originals.  Then the new Originals.  But the songs off that record were a whole lot better.  He was highly influenced by Django Reinhardt, like a lot of old jazz stuff.  What happened to him, Joe?  Because he kind of petered out.  He didn't make it beyond all those...  He petered out.  He petered out.  Yeah, he petered out in 76.  I didn't realize I said that.  His hair fell out, is what happened.  Yeah.  All of his hair fell out.  He actually started working for other people when he couldn't have it, when he wasn't writing  hits anymore.  I think, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  I think he...  I even heard him say in an interview once, there was no way to follow up Frampton Comes Alive.  There was no way to fucking follow it up.  How big of a hit was that album?  Oh, my...  It's massive.  It was...  It was...  I remember it was that and, like, the Boston album or something that year.  And those are the two albums you needed.  That was it.  The biggest selling records to that point in history.  Like, at that point, I don't even think the Beatles sold as many records as Peter Frampton  did.  At that point in time, then obviously, you know, it gets skewed because the Peter Frampton 
[01:15:00]  Comes Alive record fell off and the Beatles kept selling.  But at that point in time, it was the highest selling record ever.  And what was the song off that?  There was a lot of big hits off that, but what was the song off?  What is that wah-wah-wah?  Do you feel...  Do you feel like we do?  Show Me The Way.  That was another one.  This is him doing Do You Feel Like We Do on the Midnight Special in 1975.  In 1975.  Oh, hold on.  It's playing. 
[01:15:30]  Now, go ahead, Joe.  No, I was going to say, in 1975, I ended up making a talk box.  I'll tell you more about it.  Go, guys.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You, like, took a bullhorn apart and taped a tube to it and plugged it into an amp.  It actually worked.  It was garden hose, but it worked.  I ended up learning the thing note for note.  It was ridiculous.  See, I never would have thought of Frampton as a really great guitarist.  Obviously, Joe knows guitar a lot better.  I never would have associated him with those guys.  Yeah, no, he's a monster.  Still is.  He's a rock star, then. 
[01:16:00]  He still is.  He's played with Ringo Starr's all-star band.  He went out on the road with David Bowie.  Sorry to hear that.  He plays for other guys, too.  Yeah.  Do you think he's still rich from that album?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't have to work, I'd say, a year and a half or two years after that record came  out.  He should have went to Bosley.  He should have went to Bosley Hair Replacement from the Harvest area.  Once in a while, I see him do acoustic jobs.  Actually, it's like the 25th anniversary or 30th anniversary of Frampton, 25th anniversary. 
[01:16:30]  Frampton comes alive, coming out, 20th.  And the 30th, Patrick's giving me the 30, 3-0.  And he ended up going on tour, doing a bunch of acoustic stuff.  30 fucking years.  Wow.  Yeah.  Amazing, right?  Are you guys driving in the city?  Yeah, we're actually on the LIE now.  I'm in the A.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they're going to pop by in a little bit.  Nice.  Hang out.  Yeah, we're stopping by with the kids.  Yay!  Yay!  Get to see the little baby. 
[01:17:00]  Get to see the little kiddies.  And I'm not in a minivan.  I'm in a black Trailblazer SS.  All right.  You don't have to.  We know you've still got your testicles.  You're still cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Minivan.  All right.  We'll see you in a bit, man.  All right, Joe.  See you guys in a little while.  See you, bro.  Right on.  Let's go to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, that was like fucking listening to sports radio.  Holy fuck.  What's that, sir? 
[01:17:30]  That was what?  Oh, shut up.  I actually didn't hear you.  I really didn't.  Sorry.  What is it?  I literally did not hear him because he has music.  He says it's like listening to sports radio.  Oh, sports radio.  He's not interested in music talk.  Oh, okay.  I think go somewhere else.  We're talking to fucking.  We don't have to worry about ratings anymore, so go to another channel if you don't like  what we're talking about.  And come back, and maybe you'll like what we're doing the next break.  That's it.  I'd love to have asked him, like, what he likes when we talk about.  Yeah.  Hey, fucking chicks. 
[01:18:00]  He probably liked when we were talking to Michaela.  He's mad that we killed his heart on.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Racial epithets.  There you go.  I like that, too, though.  Yes.  And now this.  We all live in a yellow sun.  Submarine sandwich.  Yellow sun.  Submarine sandwich.  Yellow sun.  Submarine sandwich.  We all live in a yellow sun.  Submarine sandwich.  Yellow sun.  Submarine sandwich. 
[01:18:30]  Yellow sun.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Here he comes.  Please play it.  It's going to be close.  Here's the throw, here's the play of the face  Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it  Stop right there  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life? 
[01:19:00]  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife?  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it 
[01:19:30]  Let me sleep on it  And I'll give you my answer in the morning  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  I'll give you my answer in the morning  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  I'll give you my answer in the morning  I gotta know right now 
[01:20:00]  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  Will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  What's it gonna be, boy?  Come on  I can wait all night  What's it gonna be, boy? 
[01:20:30]  Yes or no?  What's it gonna be, boy?  Yes or no?  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  And answer in the morning  I gotta know right now  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife? 
[01:21:00]  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me?  And will you love me forever?  I'll sleep on it  Will you love me forever?  I'll sleep on it  Will you love me forever?  I couldn't take it any longer  Lord, I was crazed  And then the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave  I started swearing to my God  And on my mother's grave  That I would love you till the end of time  I swore that I would love you till the end of time 
[01:21:30]  So now I'm praying for the end of time  To hurry up and arrive  Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you  I don't think I can really survive  I'll never break my promise if I forget my vows  But God only knows I can do it right now  Prayin' for the end of time  I'm praying for the end of time  I'm praying for the end of time  I'm praying for the end of time  I can end my time with you 
[01:22:00]  It never felt so good, it never felt so right, and we're all glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife. 
[01:22:30]  It never felt so good, it never felt so right, and we're all glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife.  It's better than it was today.  Alright, let me do it again.  Sirius XM, the virus.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Rest in peace, buddy.  Holy shit.  I guess it's because Meatloaf is 64.  Happy birthday to Meatloaf.  We could have just said happy birthday to Meatloaf instead of playing that five minute piece.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:23:00]  Remember Engineer Steve?  We were just reminiscing during the break.  K-Rock.  He worked for K-Rock or CBS Radio or Viacom, whatever the fuck, for literally 40 years, I think.  Oh, yeah.  At least.  And one day they just told him to beat us.  Pack your shit.  Didn't really have a pension.  He was looking at us to pay his medical bills and pay his health insurance.  You know, we did what we could at the time.  But that guy, I felt so bad for him.  Pack your shit and leave.  That's everything that's wrong with this business, man. 
[01:23:30]  It's just a horror show.  No loyalty.  When they're done with you, you better hope you got enough money in the bank.  Oh, yeah.  Because you don't even know when your last day is coming.  You're done.  You're done.  You're just done.  Remember all the sadness that he had about his wife?  Oh, yeah.  I see a little picture of him down there.  Yeah.  Where is he these days?  When he left, he was all upset because he needed one more year with medical insurance  because after this certain age, he was covered, him and his wife, for the rest of the life.  Oh, yes.  And they cut him just one year short. 
[01:24:00]  This is what CBS did.  What scumbags.  This is a guy that was so loyal to the company.  I mean, look how old he is.  He started in his early 20s and he was in his 60s.  You're right.  And I'm going to say it again because it's worth repeating.  One year away from being taken care of for the rest of his life.  And the company said, we could save that money and they kicked him out the door before  he could fucking capitalize.  Amazing.  That absolutely happened.  He should be down there on Wall Street.  Oh, by the way, I just found out some information about the music we were talking about. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Donovan's song Atlantis was the song playing when they were beating Billy Bats in Goodfellas.  Yeah, that's right.  How does that song go?  I know we're trying to move on.  I don't remember.  I don't remember either.  We looked it up.  We looked it down upon the ocean.  That one.  You know.  I think it's an epic song, too.  No, it's one of those long ones.  It might be.  How long has the song been rocked?  Before it gets to the part where they're actually kicking the shit out of Billy Bats. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, that's the part where it goes like, ouch, quit hitting me, I'm Billy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's nice.  It's nice.  It's nice.  The great.  In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.  The Atlantic Ocean.  So great an area of land that from her western shores, those beautiful sailors journeying  to the south.  The western shores, the Atlantic.  Where is he?  Oh, that's fine.  Let's go.  Let's get rid of this shit.  By the way, can't he zip to it on YouTube? 
[01:25:30]  Can't he find it on YouTube and he just zip it?  You can't fast forward to these Dalet songs.  It drives me fucking bonkers.  Well, they want you to hear it.  I guess it's about a minute in.  Hey, I want to see how good E-Rock is.  Mike Schmidt is 62 years old today.  What?  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[01:26:00]  Happy birthday.  Mike A!  What happened?  I beg God, the dream came true.  Oh, boy.  He's 62.  Holy shit.  Where is he on the home run list these days?  His spot is being dropped.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's moving down that list quickly now.  Hey, Boston.  How do you feel rooting for the Yankees?  That'll feel good, right? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, you remember this.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, man.  The De Niro kick face.  Are you amazed at how they, like, who would think to put this?  Yeah.  There is a real art to putting fucking good music in movies.  Yeah.  Who would think to fucking put this in that moment?  Someone that really knows fucking music.  Yeah, man.  Way more than we do.  To know that the tone that that would bring into it.  Just know those cool songs, you know?  Chris Hazy's art.  Good question. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know why Seth Rogen wasn't on our show yesterday.  I don't know what's going on.  It's whatever.  It's not Roland, by the way.  Don't blame him.  No, and I will say this.  They suggested, because he's doing TV today, and Roland goes, well, maybe come in at 10.  No.  How about that?  No.  I like Seth, but Michael K. Williams is in.  I would, first of all, I'd rather talk to him.  And second of all, it's like he could have come in yesterday when he was here.  Yeah, I don't understand these guys coming in the building and they're not stopping by.  Maybe they haven't.  If they're agreeing to exclusivity with Howard for the day, that's fine. 
[01:27:30]  Just say that.  Well, as a company, could someone tell us?  Yeah.  So we would shut the fuck up about it?  Because it doesn't make sense.  These guys are in the building.  They used to do our show, and they're not stopping by anymore.  Yeah.  So what's going on with that?  Is there something that we need to know?  You know?  So I would say, yeah.  What were you saying, Ant?  The Red Sox now have to root for the Yankees?  Yeah.  So you think the Yankees will lay down?  That must hurt.  Well, they lost last night, which puts Boston in the raise tied for the wild card slot. 
[01:28:00]  So now we've just got to see what happens in the next couple of games.  But, boy, Boston is unraveling.  Just unraveling.  And it's hysterical to watch the Yankees because it's like, meh, whatever.  Let's just throw this guy in.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  And it is kind of a, to be a Boston fan and sit there having to hope the Yankees win,  even though, like, the Yankees are in.  It's done.  It's inconsequential as far as the Yankees are concerned.  But they do not want the Rays beating the Yankees. 
[01:28:30]  You know how annoyed they must be when the Yankees lose to it?  He's fucking yelling.  Yeah, yeah.  He just can't win when he hit them to it.  Oh.  If I was the Yankees, I would lose, like, 17 to 2.  Just fucking get blown out.  Oh, yeah.  Just totally lay down.  Just bring up, like, the kids of the players.  Yeah.  Why not?  Make it kid's day.  Yeah.  Fucking guys chasing balls in the outfield.  Lands 15 feet behind them.  Bad news bears.  Yeah.  So what do you want?  You want the Red Sox in or not?  You change every day. 
[01:29:00]  No, I change my mind.  You don't want them in.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I don't even want them to have a chance at this point.  Wow.  And I think any Red Sox fan would probably be like, you know,  ah, they fucked up so bad, especially in the past month.  We used to be big in Boston, and you're doing this to the Boston fans.  I've never been phony about my hatred towards the Red Sox.  You know, I never, and they told us when we were there, now, you know,  when you're talking sports, I talk up the Sox and the Pats, and, you know, 
[01:29:30]  you went to the game, you're a fan.  Like, oh, no.  No.  But it's just got to be painful.  And then last night was, like, the perfect thing.  The Sox lost against Baltimore, and then fucking the Yankees lost against the Rays,  so they're even, even Steven for the wild card spot.  You want to comment?  Matt in New Hampshire.  Fuck you, Anthony.  Typical Yankee fan. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Only open your mouth when it is safe.  Right.  Only in big capital letters.  Pay attention when you know they're in the playoffs.  Yeah.  Like, every year, pretty much.  Yeah.  That's the way it should be for a fan.  Yeah.  What?  What are you wasting your whole year for?  When do they get to the playoffs and get out that Yankee hat and blow out the dust and go, yay?  That's when it gets exciting.  Exactly.  I never understood.  I'm going to do a fucking talk about a goddamn eight, nine-game homestand in fucking May.  I don't give a shit. 
[01:30:30]  I never understood the sports fan.  Or, yeah, when their team is officially eliminated, they still go to the games.  I never understood that.  It's not a fucking, you fair weather fan, you fucking, shut up.  I love the ones who think.  But the season's over.  Yeah.  Done.  That's what it comes down to.  It's over at that point.  Why would you go?  I don't get it.  It was, uh...  Especially because of how expensive these damn games are.  Maybe back in the day when a ticket was easy, you'd go there for a little entertainment,  but you're investing a lot of money to see a team that's completely out. 
[01:31:00]  The team itself should drop their ticket prices at that point, right?  You know what's fucking funny also is the goddamn Rays, the crowd at the stadium,  and it was down in, you know, Florida.  Uh, it was, it was barely full, and most of the people there were Yankee fans.  Like, the Rays are playing to try to get into the playoffs, you know?  Uh, but most of the people there were Yankee fans, and it was just a, was it a full stadium? 
[01:31:30]  I want the Red Sox in, I really do.  Do you?  And I do want the Red Sox to beat the Yankees.  Oh, stop it.  And that's not because of our time in Boston.  Oh.  I've never liked the Yankees.  Yeah, but you can't.  Mets over Yankees always.  You a hater, yo.  If the Yankees are out of it and the Mets are in it, I'll still...  Oh, that's right.  That never really happens.  But are...  You're not one of those guys that jumps from one New York team to the other, are you?  I would if, uh...  Like, I fucking hate the Giants, and when the... 
[01:32:00]  When?  I just said something I shouldn't have said.  If the Jets are eliminated, I don't want the Giants, ever.  No.  Fuck that.  I'll default to the Mets if it ever gets to where, you know, the Mets are in and the Yankees are out.  No way.  I default to the Mets.  I'll default to the Bills if the Jets are out of it.  Hello, Bills.  Because I spent 10 years in New York, but...  Hello, Bills.  What does that mean?  Nothing.  Hello, Bills.  It's absolutely nothing.  Yeah, it is a lot of... 
[01:32:30]  There are a lot of transplanted New Yorkers in Florida.  That's why you see a lot of...  Yeah, there's a ton.  ...Yankee fans down at the...  Yankee fans down there.  ...the Rays game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Jimmy's team won last night.  Jimmy's team.  He sure did.  Oh, Jimmy.  I wouldn't know.  Uh, Romo.  Romo played, too.  Hey, did he?  Oh, God love him.  With a hole in his lung.  Broken ribs, and he's playing out there.  One or two.  Tough as nails.  What a competitor.  Huh?  Watch him.  Sorry.  It's tough as nails. 
[01:33:00]  What a competitor.  Fucking sarcastic motherfucker.  Wow, you've really turned the corner on your sports, really.  I don't give a fuck about those guys, man.  I really don't.  And I don't mean to be a dick, but it just, most of it bores me, and I just, I can't fucking  deal with these cunty athletes.  The majority of them are cunts.  Yeah.  Well, they beat the Redskins 18-16.  Last minute field goal, was it, or?  Uh, with like, a little less than two minutes.  Oh, okay.  They kicked six field goals, though. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, six field goals.  Really?  Yep.  So Romo was not happening.  Well, you know, he had a...  Well, he can't really get his arm around.  No.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Yeah.  Why didn't he make a touch-a-down?  He had, at one point, he had a first and goal on the two, and he couldn't get it.  Yeah, why would he?  Good.  Oh, wow.  Fuckhead.  Oh, boy.  Good.  Couldn't even fucking on the two-yard line.  He had a first and goal on the two, and couldn't fucking do it.  Oh, boy.  He can't even make a touch-a-down. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, boy.  I want a guy who can make a touch-a-down.  What happened?  He just kept running it forward, calling predictable fucking running plays around the middle?  I didn't watch.  I was watching other stuff.  What were you watching?  What were you watching?  Last night?  You really want to know?  Yeah.  I watched Pan Am, and I watched Person of Interest.  What a tool.  I like to check out the new shows.  Sexy Stews on Pan Am. 
[01:34:30]  That's great.  The Lockerbie episodes are real hoot.  So the advertising for that show, was it awful?  It was okay.  What is it, though?  It's like a soap opera with stewardess and pilots fucking?  Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, the 60s, you know, glamour of airline travel.  But there's no romance.  They were just fucking each other.  Well, that's the romance.  It was all right.  They were bumping their genitals together.  It was a simpler time.  Yes, a time when a flight on an aircraft was something you'd put a suit on for. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  Yes.  How did the planes look?  Because they really refurbished from scratch.  They supposedly did an amazing job.  Yeah, the planes look great.  How's the first class look on that?  707.  Very nice.  They're cool?  Yeah.  The lounge, everybody smoking Harry Potter.  It seems like it would be really cool to, like, fly back then.  And what, what, did they just walk through the airport and onto the plane?  Yep.  Just like, hey, here we go.  Right onto the plane.  Ah, fuck it.  You used to be able to have your family, like, take you right to the gate. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  And be like, take it easy.  All right, bye.  Give them a big hug.  Come on.  Help you on with your fucking bag onto the plane.  They didn't give a shit.  I remember meeting my parents years ago.  They were in Florida or something.  I met them at Newark Airport.  And, you know, I walked right up and met them.  And there was a smoking area outside.  You can go out and smoke.  And I remember some guy trying to look at my penis in the bathroom.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  At that point, you got to back up a foot.  No, I was all weird.  Back up a foot.  Come on.  Yeah, it's true. 
[01:36:00]  Trying to look at my weenie.  Pervert.  And how would you know that unless you were looking at him?  No, because I could feel him.  You could feel him.  You could feel those eyes?  Yeah, you feel.  When there's a man turning toward your wiener.  You feel it.  Yeah.  I went out and smoked and walked it off.  I don't have to see my parents and pretend that someone didn't just try to look at their  son's penis.  Yeah, don't walk it off.  Someone tried to look at your son's penis.  Good news, Jimmy.  Eddie's going to tell you he's from Dallas that Romo did not blow it last night.  Eddie.  Hey, what's happening, guys? 
[01:36:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey.  Just going to tell you, Romo didn't blow that game.  He was more of a leader than he was ever last night.  They had...  What, did he point to the thing and tell the field goal kicker to do it?  I want you to know what a leader was.  He'd make a touch-and-down.  Defense dominated, but the center dropped the...  fucked up the fumble four times last night.  Snap.  The center was really terrible.  Really bad?  Yeah.  Was he new?  Oh, it was terrible.  And I'd be shocked.  But Romo was the first time I'd ever seen him do anything, leadership-wise. 
[01:37:00]  Cool.  Third game of the season.  Just when you need it.  Yeah.  Get that out of your way until the playoffs.  Thank God you don't fucking waste your time with that towards the end of the season.  All right.  See you guys later.  All right, brother.  Hey, there's another sports story that's a little strange, by the way.  This Sean Avery thing for the hockey fans.  You following this, Travis?  No.  There's rumors about Sean Avery.  Rumors that he might be, you know.  Gay rumors?  Are there gay rumors?  He did one of those-  There's rumors.  Anti-gay thing.  Yeah, there's rumors. 
[01:37:30]  And whatever.  I mean, you know, anti-gay.  Anti-gay.  And if he is, whatever.  But he's in a tough spot because I think it was last night.  Bless you.  Thank God.  You know, he's the enforcer and he gets in a lot of fights and a lot of shit on the ice  and one of the guys called him a fag or a faggot.  Wow.  And he's really fucking pissed off about that.  But that goes with the territory.  It goes with hockey and it goes with that whole, you know, beating the shit out of each other  type shit.  So he's in a tough spot, man.  You can't be tough and sensitive.  Be one or the other. 
[01:38:00]  Either be the guy who's an animal on the field.  Right.  If you're the enforcer on the ice, you gotta be, you gotta hear everything.  It's between a rock and a heart on, though, in that situation.  Because you're, all right.  He's kind of mad and wants the league to do something because, what, Kobe Bryant got  in a lot of trouble for saying the same word.  What a baby he told?  But, well, what is the article saying?  Yeah, I guess they were in an altercation and he accused Wayne Simmons of making homophobic  remarks.  What a fucking baby.  This is the only sport that still allows fighting. 
[01:38:30]  And you're getting upset over a homophobic remark.  What a fucking asshole.  What a snitch.  But do you hear what I'm getting at here?  He's in a tough spot because he might be.  So he doesn't want to, you know, hear that shit.  Even if he is, too fucking bad.  They say some awful shit on the ice.  They talk about your mother.  Punch me in the face, but don't call me a fag.  Stop it.  Right.  If hockey gets politically correct, no one should go to the games.  You want to watch the video?  Yes.  Yeah.  Did he point and go, look what he said, look what he said?  I haven't seen this.  And just so you know, what's his name? 
[01:39:00]  Because I don't know his name.  Wayne Simmons.  Wayne Simmons.  Say the black guy in hockey.  Well, hold on.  There's a good story about the black guy in hockey.  Last week, he was playing in a game, preseason or whatever, exhibition game.  And then somebody decided it would be funny to throw a fucking banana at this guy.  Was that last week?  I thought that was years ago that happened.  No.  This just happened last week.  Yeah.  So they threw a banana at him, and now he was the one that was fighting with Sean Avery  and called him either a fag or a fag.  And Sean Avery's argument would be, well, if I called him a nigger, that'd be a problem.  But then here comes the fucking cat tricky part. 
[01:39:30]  He has to go, yeah, but he's black.  That's why that's offensive.  Oh.  If someone called you a nigger as a white guy, you wouldn't be offended because you're white.  So are you gay or not?  He's going to have to answer that question if it gets down to it.  But when two guys are fighting, the F word comes out.  Come on, faggot.  Come on.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And he's the enforcer, so.  Darn sexy comes out sometimes.  It's going to be interesting to watch this situation.  I can see it.  Thanks.  Well, I mean, just in general.  Not that far.  Just in general, it's going to be interesting. 
[01:40:00]  Because wasn't, was Newski did that to Avery last year, the blowjob gesture?  That was to Sean Avery too, right?  Yeah.  So they know how to get to him.  They were brawling.  The guy made the, oh, oh, oh.  Right.  Kind of blowjob gesture.  Because Sean Avery's a motherfucker on the ice.  So now they figured out how to kind of.  A motherfucker on the ice.  They figured out how to get to him.  We're talking at the beginning.  They were part of the big deal.  Now, Drew's holding him back.  We'll take a look at here.  Drew's going to hold Simmons back.  Avery was threatening to go after Drew. 
[01:40:30]  Fucking faggot.  He goes, hey, fucking faggot.  You saw him yell it.  You could read his lips totally.  You know how tough a black guy on the Philadelphia Flyers has to be?  Jesus Christ.  No kidding.  No fucking kidding.  He goes, hey, fucking faggot.  Although the point is, if he called that guy a nigger, the whole country would come down  on him.  Yeah.  But again, then if he's gay, because why else would that bother you?  It wouldn't bother anybody.  It wouldn't bother you unless you are, I think. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, because if two guys are arguing and one guy yells, you fucking faggot, that's  just two guys arguing.  Because you don't take it as a literal term.  You take it as, oh, he's calling me, you know, a faggot.  I think it pisses you off a little bit.  Not an argument.  No way.  Not to that level.  If I was arguing, fucking somebody, you're like, shut up, you're a faggot.  No, it would be nothing.  Not to run to the league and say, punish this bad man.  Did he really run to the league?  Go to someone over here and they're doing something.  No, he wants the league to take action.  What a fucking asshole.  If you're Sean Avery, you can't go down that road.  What a baby. 
[01:41:30]  What a fucking baby.  You beat the shit out of people for a living.  What are you talking about?  Cooling it up.  How do you know he...  The man in the face on the ice is okay.  Right.  But names aren't?  Get the fuck out of here.  How do you know he's pushing it?  It's all over the place today, yeah.  But he's pushing it?  Oh, yeah.  What a fucking baby.  And he mentions Kobe Bryant saying, you know, they did something when Kobe said it.  Wah!  I don't like that!  Then don't be a tough guy on the ice.  Right.  Like, don't be ready to fucking knock somebody's teeth out and be mad if they're going to call 
[01:42:00]  you a name.  That is enraging.  I call it the F word, okay?  Let's just set that rule now, okay?  Because I don't like that word.  What do you mean?  I don't give a shit.  Who cares?  The F word.  What's the word there?  Forget about it or something?  You're Italian?  That's it.  Sean Avery reportedly once called George LaRock a monkey.  Really?  Really?  And he's black.  Yeah, so.  Oh, I thought it was an actual monkey. 
[01:42:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people.  Curious.  Mikey's got more on this.  Mikey.  You.  Hi, Mike.  Go ahead real fast.  Hey, yeah, so George LaRock came out last year and called, you know, so that Sean Avery  called him a porch monkey.  And then a couple other things came out where, you know, he was dropping the M-bomb on, like,  other players in the league.  And Alexander Froloff, somebody who played with him.  On the Rangers and on the Kings came out and said that, you know, he said, like, stuff  like that all the time in the locker rooms. 
[01:43:00]  And then now that somebody came out and called him a faggot, all of a sudden, he's all up  in arms about it.  Yeah, man.  That's a tough spot for him.  I just got a tweet from someone.  It really is.  It said Avery was fucking Alicia Cuthbert.  I don't know who she is.  Is she an actress?  Oh, yeah.  She was on 24.  For years.  So that's not too faggy.  How do you know that?  She's very pretty.  Yeah, but I'm pretty sure that's cover-up.  Maybe.  Oh, we've all heard the rumors with him, though, so I don't know what's true.  I hate him now.  I know nothing about hockey, and I hate his guts now.  She played Kiefer's daughter.  Wait, the fucking alleged gay guy was having sex with her? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  She's a big, like, uh...  I can't see her.  Get out of here.  She's dated a lot of hockey men.  Oh, she probably likes him when they did with that big...  Oh, go ahead, sir.  You talk.  What were you saying?  She probably likes him when they hit him with this...  See how that hurts?  He was banging a black dick back in the day, and it was all over the papers that, you  know, he was cheating on Alicia, whatever the hell her name is, with some black model,  and then, you know... 
[01:44:00]  You're TMZ, this fucking gossip?  Exactly.  Gossipy Gertie.  How do you know everything?  You know everything, sir.  You're fucking Gertie.  You're enough for you.  You're God.  Oh, yeah.  For you and your gossip.  Yeah.  No, I'm just...  I'm an Avery friend myself.  I think it's kind of a pussy move to come out and, you know, start going up to every  reporter you can find and just, oh, you called me a faggot.  It's like, come on, I play hockey myself.  Suck it up and play the fucking game.  What is the problem?  Avery spent...  Douche.  The off-season in 2008 interning at Vogue magazine. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, boy.  Because he's a self-confessed clothes horse who has been known to give girlfriends advice  on how to dress.  Oh, boy.  Turn it off.  He has expressed a dream to become a fashion editor after his days on the night.  Oh, that's not good.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't bode well.  Avery has said,  You do suits and pants, and that's about that. 
[01:45:00]  Women's clothes tell a story.  That's what's interesting to me.  Oh, boy.  What story do they tell?  She didn't want to fucking have her pussy get cold when it was outdoors.  That's the story.  Story of women's fashion.  Yeah, she wants to get fucked in the shitter in the subway with her fucking face pushed  against the tile.  Or she froze her pussy with getting chilly.  You guys, we should have an open mind.  Man, there's a lot of straight guys in fashion.  There really are.  Yeah, there's that guy that... 
[01:45:30]  You see them all on that project runway show.  Or the one guy's name...  I don't remember.  Well, there's got to be one.  There's one guy, Jerry, in the Midwest.  Jerry.  There you go.  Jerry is the only one so far.  He revealed on ESPN that as a child, he would play with dolls that he would steal from his babysitter.  I can't believe that guy would yell that at him across the ice.  Why would he yell that?  Oh, boy.  He's a proponent.  He's a supporter of same-sex marriage.  He said, I certainly have been surrounded by the gay community. 
[01:46:00]  And living in New York...  Oh, boy.  And when you live in LA...  We're surrounded!  You certainly have a lot of gay friends.  Do you?  Okey-dokey.  Yeah, a lot of gay friends.  He's also a vintage wine aficionado.  Why wouldn't he be?  Everyone likes some good wine.  Arrange flowers, too.  And do window treatments.  He's a hockey player.  Hockey players don't do any of that stuff.  I just hate him because he's crying like a fucking bitch about being called a name. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  Especially if you're an enforcer.  Deal with it.  Whatever your sexual orientation is, you've got to be able to deal with that shit, especially  if you're fighting people on the ice for a living.  You just start checking people against the boards, and when he's got them there, just do  that dog hump thing against somebody, it's like, hey, hey, what are you doing?  And, like, we have no idea in the end.  There's been wrong ones.  Oh, come on.  No idea in the end?  What do you mean by that?  We have no fucking idea, man.  Not a sloppy party bottom?  Apparently, he was listed in the little black book that was seized from Kristen Davis, the 
[01:47:00]  Manhattan madam.  But he said he was the victim of a practical joke and blamed his enemies for using his  name.  Yeah, those are always practical jokes.  Always happens to me.  One more sports item.  We're about to get the blackest team in sports.  What?  You want to guess?  The ssss.  The ssss.  This will officially be the blackest team, meaning the team itself and its fans. 
[01:47:30]  It's got to be the Knicks.  No.  Jay-Z's Nets?  Yes.  They are about to become the blackest fucking sports franchise.  How is that?  They're going to be in Brooklyn.  Yeah, Brooklyn.  They're even thinking of calling themselves the Brooklyn Kings.  No, they're the Nets.  But that was a thought.  Oh, they're definitely going to be Brooklyn Nets?  Yeah, they're the Nets.  Okay.  Okay, I did not know that.  Why are they going to be called the Nets?  Brooklyn.  Because they were the New Jersey Nets.  Why are they moving to Brooklyn? 
[01:48:00]  Where Brooklyn at?  Does anyone know the blackest sports franchise now?  Meaning more black fans for that team than any other team.  Black fans?  Probably the Raiders.  Oakland.  I was thinking Raiders was on the top of my head.  Cowboys maybe too, though.  Because they have so many fans everywhere.  You don't know.  You can't really.  I'm talking about, you know, you go to the stadium and it's very obvious.  Raiders.  That the Blacks really like the team.  Detroit.  Any basketball team, really.  Pistons.  Pistons I would probably put up there.  Yeah.  I would guess.  Washington.  Atlanta Falcons. 
[01:48:30]  Falcons, really?  Now we're just naming black cities.  I'm just naming black cities.  Yeah.  I'm getting the info from Peltog here.  Yeah, from sports people.  Why don't they do that on sports radio?  The blackest sports franchise.  Yeah.  But the, I mean, the Brooklyn Nets for, oh my God.  The Brooklyn Nets.  Right down in Atlantic Yard.  The stadium will be opened by one, maybe two, maybe three Jay-Z concerts.  Oh, great.  I've heard eight.  Eight.  What?  I'll go to at least. 
[01:49:00]  Are they going to do eight concerts before eight?  What are you crazy?  The rumor is eight, but it's definitely going to be three.  But what about us white people?  You can go to a Jay-Z show.  You can come with me.  I would get killed.  Who's coming with me?  I don't think you would.  He's probably got a big enough crossover audience.  He's probably mostly black.  Someone like Sam could go.  I can't go.  No, you can go.  He's probably the most accessible rapper.  In Brooklyn playing, though?  Playing Brooklyn Nets.  Let me tell you.  I wouldn't go to that.  No.  I would assume that there's going to be problems.  They're going to be patching some holes in that fucking stadium.  You're going to feel like that. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  And where's the stadium?  Where are the arena?  Atlantic Yard.  Is that bad?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  This will be the blackest franchise in sports.  When I used to live in Bay Ridge, that's where all the black people would get off.  The Brooklyn Nets.  That just sounds weird.  That's what I'm saying.  But it's a team for the blacks.  Better than New Jersey, though.  I'll say that.  It sounds better than New Jersey.  Of course.  The Brooklyn Nets.  Of course.  Isn't it amazing how they just fuck fans?  What about the New Jersey Nets fans who've been loyal for all those years?  They weren't.  Oh, they weren't?  Not really.  Okay.  They played through a lot of empty seats. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, they did?  All right.  A lot of them.  I just feel bad for the ones that would go, but fuck them, too.  No, the fucking Jersey's not that loyal.  Yeah, but I mean, you've still got to make money.  When it comes to their...  No, no, no.  I get it.  I get Devils.  I've been to a bunch of Devils games.  There's a lot of empty seats.  Nets games have been a lot of empty seats.  Because they're afraid the Devils will melt the ice.  It's so hot.  That's what happens, Chip.  Nobody's afraid of that.  Swear.  Sebastian Bach in a few minutes?  Yes.  That's cool.  Anything else about sports today?  That's about it, right?  Really? 
[01:50:30]  Not really.  So is that...  What is that?  Atlantic Yards design.  Oh.  There's big buildings in Brooklyn?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Sure.  What's the tallest building in Brooklyn?  40 feet.  40 fucking feet.  That's right.  Wow.  Holy shit.  The Kiwanis.  Now this.  We all live in a yellow...

[01:59:30]  We hope to see you in Miami.  November 11th and 12th, 224-69-TRADE.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is that what we do?  He does want to hear this.  Is that what we do?  We play the songs and then...  He does want to hear this.  And that's been done in radio like a thousand fucking times.  Especially a hit from a while ago. 
[02:00:00]  By the way, blackest team has to be said.  The Saints.  Good job, boys.  Coming up with the answer.  But I think the Brooklyn Nets are going to give the Saints a run for their money as far  as the blackest sports franchise.  Let's bring Sebastian Bach in.  Yeah.  Of course.  Sebastian.  How you doing, man?  We're playing I Remember You.  Oh, great.  Yeah, right?  I know.  Hey, dude.  How's it going?  And obviously a huge hit for you. 
[02:00:30]  But do you like hearing that as you're going on to a radio show?  Well, it's better than some other singer.  That's true.  Yeah, good point.  I hear any of that shit.  I always find it hard to listen to them.  I can't listen to them.  If I walk in somewhere and they play one of my bits, I just have to take the headphones  off.  I'm like, it's fucking horrendous.  What, the bit about getting blown under the boardwalk?  Monster Rain.  Oh, Monster Rain.  I would love that.  I would love to find.  I watch your show.  Oh, I loved it.  Oh, thanks, man.  It was hilarious.  It was humiliating when I meet guys I've met before they saw that bit and then afterwards. 
[02:01:00]  It's like, oh, yeah.  It was going to give me a sanitary wipe.  That's the good old Monster Rain book.  I know how it is.  Young boy exploring.  It's a classic bit now.  I can't listen to myself.  I don't know how singers do.  I guess you have to, but it drives me nuts.  Do you like hearing your songs?  I like hearing my news songs.  Oh, you're so don't even want to talk about that shit, right?  What?  The old stuff.  The old stuff.  You don't want to talk about the old days. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know.  Although there was that.  I got to say something about that song.  I remember you.  That was playing.  I probably went a full year of hearing that song and not knowing what the fuck you were saying.  Like that love letters in the sand part.  Oh, really?  I got a song like that, too.  The way you say it, I'm like, I have no idea.  And then one day I was in a music store and there was sheet music and it was like fucking Skid Row.  And I was like, holy shit.  And I actually went like, I'm finally going to figure out what the fuck he was saying. 
[02:02:00]  And I grabbed the book.  I opened it up.  I'm like, love letters in the sand.  It doesn't even sound like that.  It's like love lettuce innocence.  Love lettuce.  Something about a head of lettuce.  I don't even know what the fuck you're saying.  What's the song that I, um, um, never mind.  Sorry, it's too early.  I need some more coffee.  It's too early, more coffee.  There's some songs from the 70s that have been bugging me since I was like a little kid.  And I still don't know.  And it's amazing years later when you figure it out.  It's like, oh, like this big revelation moment. 
[02:02:30]  Kiss, you're a big Kiss fan.  Fucking shock me.  He says, shock me, put on your black leather.  For years I thought he was saying, put on your glass sweater.  What is that?  Me.  Put on your glass sweater.  That's great.  I was a kid.  I don't know.  That's retarded.  I was an idiot.  That's funny.  You lost your house?  Will you get that out of the way?  From the, all the flooding?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, I got, I got divorced in December and I just lost my home. 
[02:03:00]  And other than that, everything's going great.  Oh, yeah, great.  Somebody tweeted me, what's your next record going to be called?  The hurricane took everything your wife did.  And I got a melody for it.  It's going to be a country tour, country song.  Hurricane took everything that my wife did it.  It's going to be killer.  It's going to be killer.  It's going to be killer.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah.  Trying to get John Rich to play on it.  I like it.  That's where you were living? 
[02:03:30]  It wasn't like a second house or something?  No, I was there for 20 years.  It was MTV Cribs.  Right.  Now it's MTV Underwater Cribs.  MTV Condemned Cribs.  The Weather Channel Cribs.  Condemned Cribs.  Hey, dude, here's my fucking, here's where I used to live.  Here's my recording studio.  Get your scuba gear.  We'll go fucking do some recording.  They actually sent a dive team into my house.  That doesn't happen every day. 
[02:04:00]  To search for dead fucking bodies in my basement.  Really?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That doesn't happen every day.  Did you get your shit out or anything out?  Believe it or not, no.  I got everything from the upper two levels, but like everybody says, you know, Irene wasn't  that serious, but in Vermont and like in Jersey, it was serious.  Oh, bad, yeah.  It was really bad.  How did you find out it got you?  I was on stage with Godsmack in Colorado. 
[02:04:30]  Loved Godsmack, by the way.  Yeah, and I didn't think it would be bad because I never had no moisture in the house in two decades.  Ever, yeah.  Never.  And, you know, I woke up the next morning.  My house was condemned.  Fucking, I moved into the Comfort Inn.  It was hilarious because I wrote this obituary for Janie Lane from Warren, who died alone  in a Comfort Inn.  And within a week, I was alone in a Comfort Inn.  Oh, man.  I was like, whoa, that sucks. 
[02:05:00]  I was like, damn.  What happened there?  Are you going crazy or do you just have a good sense of humor?  We're all trying to figure it out.  I just feel like Willie Nelson when they, you know, the tax man kicked him out of his  home and he had fuck all.  Yeah.  Where did all the, I mean, I know it was the hurricane and stuff, but you said you hadn't  had a moisture problem in there in 20 years.  Nothing.  Where did it all come in?  From windows or was it?  There's a reservoir across from my house.  A quash.  There's a reservoir across from my house. 
[02:05:30]  Who am I imitating there?  Elmer Fudd?  Or Pacino?  Either one.  Works.  No, there's a reservoir that overflowed because of, you know, all the water.  Oh, shit.  And it just like.  Right into my living room.  Poured right in.  Thanks.  That was a heartbreaker, too, because it's like, it's like everybody, the family lives,  so it's like, all right, that's good.  But the stuff that like, I start thinking about collectibles that you lose, and it was like,  fuck, man, because she's a big Kiss family.  You can't even talk about it. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, I bet.  Autographed everything.  That you can get back to.  I heard you on Eddie Trunk saying that.  Because you're Sebastian Bach.  You can get the autograph stuff.  You know all the musicians.  They all know you.  So Ace, all those guys would re-sign stuff for you, probably happily.  I think that stuff, most of them can get back to.  Yeah, who wants to go through that shit?  You know, you had it.  What was the most valuable thing you lost in that?  Well, my house.  Obviously, it's pretty valuable.  I would guess.  That's where it's collectibles.  Oh, that was probably number one.  That was my favorite thing I ever actually bought. 
[02:06:30]  But that one thing you would have ran back in and grabbed.  The one thing that really bugs me, my dad's stereo.  My dad died in 2002.  He was 57 years old, and I had his Marantz amp from the 70s, and his custom speakers that  he had that he loved, and his turntable, and his record collection, and I was going to  refurbish it all and, you know, drop the needle, and now I'll have to go swimming and find  the needle. 
[02:07:00]  What's the prognosis for the house there?  Is it a...  It's condemned.  Condemned.  Yeah, I've got a new house in Atlantic Highlands.  It's not quite as nice as that one.  Damn.  Did you have flood insurance for that?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I did.  Thank God.  Did the scuba divers grab anything for you?  Yeah, couldn't they?  When they were looking for the dead bodies?  Fucking travel.  I'm being serious.  It might be something.  I don't know.  Could you get your kiss pinball machine, even though it wouldn't be functional anymore,  could you...  Because that's replaceable.  I mean, it sucks, but you could...  Could they get anything out that even if it wouldn't work, at least you'd still have the 
[02:07:30]  item, or is it...  I got a lot of stuff out.  Yeah.  It all smells like shit.  It does, right?  It's like, do I really want this now?  It's fucking horrible.  I'm sorry.  I had a Gargoyles from the 79 tour.  The Dynasty tour, right?  Yeah, and they were floating in the muck.  I got them out, though.  Oh, you got them?  Yeah, I got them.  All right, dude.  They smell like fucking ass.  They just...  It's not crystal clear Perrier that's pouring in your basement.  No, no, dude.  It's muck and shit and...  And the smell is...  And it makes you sick.  Like, there's black mold in there, and then they're fucking hawking up shit and coughing. 
[02:08:00]  And fucking sick and wearing masks and...  How bad is black mold?  Black mold's not good.  It's pretty bad.  It's not good to be...  It's not, right?  No.  I don't want to breathe that shit in.  They're going to fuck you up.  Me and Florentine lived with it for three years in Jersey.  He was my roommate.  Well, you do.  Yeah, we did a crib.  Yeah.  Black mold?  For three years.  Yeah, we used to do cribs.  We did a cribs at Jimmy's house.  We did it the other way, though.  And he had, like, these pictures hanging on the wall.  And he'd lift the pictures up, and you'd see just behind it... 
[02:08:30]  Get out of here.  ...was dripping black mold.  It's dripping.  And you know Florentine from that metal show?  He was my roommate.  Oh, my God.  And in Jim's room, it was so bad that he had tin foil over the fucking wall where the black  mold had just bled through, and they couldn't look at it anymore.  I didn't realize that was probably bad for your lungs, and now I have breathing issues.  So I'm like, oh, boy, I hope it's not from that shit.  It is really bad.  It's bad.  And as a singer, you can't be fucking with shit like that, man.  No, no.  That's for sure.  I'm still glad that I did my CD, you know, before this happened. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because I wouldn't be able to concentrate on it.  Well, that's true, too.  Yeah, to be able to concentrate and stuff.  Man, so, yeah, but you got a new CD out.  Your new CD's in stores today.  It's the number one most downloaded song on Amazon for the last three weeks.  And they added the video on VH1 Classic.  They're playing it, and it's got some good reviews.  And very happy with the CD.  To be putting out a CD in 2011 is like releasing a new typewriter. 
[02:09:30]  I got the ribbon going.  I fucking...  You know, it's a fucking...  I can't even remember the name of a typewriter.  I can't either.  A typo?  I can't either.  Corona, maybe?  Oh, Corona.  Did I nail it?  That's fun, because it's a beer.  It's kind of weird to be holding a CD.  I've got to be honest with you, Sebastian.  Yeah, damn.  Hey, we're actually releasing it on vinyl, too.  Really?  Which is really cool.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  I'm going to miss the little booklets and stuff. 
[02:10:00]  I love that shit, man.  Yeah.  The only place you get them now is Best Buy, and they don't take care of their music section.  Get a download PDF file with a fucking vinyl.  And the funniest thing, you go to Best Buy, like, you went there two years ago, it was  12 aisles of CDs, and then it was 10, then it was 8, then it was 6.  It's squished down a 1.  It's terrible.  It's fucking terrible.  It's like, I'm still in there, though.  Fuck it.  Woo!  You're in.  I'm in one of their six fucking little shelves.  It's Lil Wayne, fucking Lady Gaga, Sebastian Bach. 
[02:10:30]  But will that affect you negatively, though?  Because you're, I mean, the download, people are going to download it, like, now, even more,  it's an impulse buy.  They may go, Sebastian, fuck it, and then just download it.  It might even help sales, no?  Dude, I let it all go.  You kind of like, it used to be you put out a, go on tour to promote your record, now  it's kind of like you put the record out to go on tour, kind of.  Right.  It's like the opposite.  Yeah.  Yeah, and a lot more people do the kind of a la carte thing with downloads.  Yeah, I don't get that. 
[02:11:00]  Like, if you don't want to buy the whole album, they just buy a couple of songs, but yeah.  I still like albums.  I liked, yeah, I liked going into a store, buying an album, and then, you know, you  would always get the one song, you're like, skip this fucking piece of shit, get the  needle up, back over, I'm not listening to that fucking song, that hasn't even grown  on me, this sucks.  It wasn't paying me out.  You have to hop over that track.  That one track, that would just suck, and it was even worse with an eight track.  But bands started getting smart and putting that stuff at the end, you know? 
[02:11:30]  They kind of even knew, like, you gotta be hardcore to listen to our last track, so we'll  put it there for you, just in case you want to stay.  Do you remember when one song would skip on the record, and you, and literally, I fucking  listened to Flaming Youth off Kiss Destroyer.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The skip part, I can still hear it when I hear the song.  You expect to hear it.  Where he goes to break out of my key, and it would just go, to brage, and the whole  eight out of my key was taken off. 
[02:12:00]  Really?  I had a, for mine, that was Everybody Wants Some by Van Halen, that guitar solo.  And you can't unhear that once you hear it.  It's stopped.  No, no.  It's like part of the song after a while.  Yeah.  You hear it now on the radio.  Flaming Youth is ruined for me.  It's destroyed.  To brage.  What are these extra words?  Oh, that's right.  Break out of my key.  Okay.  That's good.  Yeah, we all have one of those.  I think I had a Bad Company song that did that once.  Oh, my Lord.  Just skipped, and that's it.  You know she lost it. 
[02:12:30]  I'm sorry.  No, I'm fine.  I'm just rambling.  That was, it was a lot of Skid Row stuff, a lot of, you had like a lot of original footage,  which you said you kind of wished you had put it on a DVD.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  But I guess the stuff now to do is back it up on all.  Why are you making it hurt even more?  I'm not.  I'm not.  We got over that.  We got past the house thing.  It's like getting an ice pick in the head.  I'm sorry, man.  It only feels good when it stops.  And he thought the beating was over, but nah, we're going back to it.  But no, no, it's, I'm, oh, my God.  So, what else did you lose?  I'm sorry, man.  The one-of-a-kind shit. 
[02:13:00]  I guess because I'm such a fucking, I'm a collector of stuff, so I appreciate that.  Well, um, you know.  I, okay, I had a whole, I had a whole fucking closet down there full of VHS tapes.  And, and Super 8 tapes.  You know, from, from Pantera tours and shit like this.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You're living Jimmy's nightmare.  Because Jimmy being a collector, if his, uh.  I did, I did put it on DVD, but.  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm a weird saver of stuff, so I guess that stuff resonates with me even more than Deathswood. 
[02:13:30]  Like, it's just weird stuff like that.  But again.  If you lost your shit, would you be able to live, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, of course.  He is a major collector.  Yeah, but I, but I'm the same way.  Major.  It would suck, but it's like, it happened, it's like, look at Christopher Lloyd.  I mean, he lost, his house burned, he lost everything.  Yeah, that would be bad.  And, you know, back to the future stuff.  But, you know, you're alive.  You realize it's just shit in the end.  At the end of the day.  It's just shit.  Like, what was that saying about smoking pot?  I'd rather go through a day with... 
[02:14:00]  You can tell I'm familiar with the subject.  That actually is the best quote for smoking pot ever.  Right there.  It works.  That was perfect.  What was the pot thing I'd rather be smoking and rich than poor with none or, you know,  something like that.  Oh, boy.  Hey, it's serious radio.  Fuck it. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, it is.  Have you been doing any or looking into doing any more Broadway shows or anything?  Because you're fucking really good.  Oh, thank you.  And Jekyll and Hyde.  Thank you.  Jekyll and Hyde was great.  We go back to that time.  Rocky Horror, too.  Thank you.  You made us go back to Broadway.  Yeah.  You did, though.  I forgot what year that was.  That was probably 10 years ago now.  Yeah, that was a while ago.  It was the 16th.  I was in Hair.  Also, I'm like...  Oh, Calcutta.  Am I at a musical?  I'm saying to myself.  Yeah.  And we loved it, though.  Thank you, dude.  I liked it.  I loved it, too.  I got that on video. 
[02:15:00]  Who were you in Rocky Horror?  I was Riff Raff.  Oh, you were?  Okay.  They wanted me to be...  Who's the lead?  Frank and Transvestite.  I can't really sing that.  Tim Curry, yeah.  Sweet Transvestite.  Well, yes, I can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can pull it off.  But no, pulling off the riffraff parts, that was fucking great.  That was fun.  Thank you, dude.  Because that really sounded good, man.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  I loved...  I would love the chance to do the Green Goblin in Spider-Man.  Oh, really?  In the Spider-Man musical?  Yeah, but I would be like the Silver Age. 
[02:15:30]  I wouldn't want to wear the big helmet thing.  Right.  Like, that would be a drag.  But I would do the old school fucking hair up in the barn.  Paint my face green.  I could totally kick the shit out of Peter Parker fucking eight times a week.  He really is a fucking jizz bag, isn't he, Peter Parker?  I'm so happy they killed him and already fucking...  I would love that, though.  To be in a Spider-Man movie?  Well, no, I just love the whole Marvel thing.  I think it's cool.  What other shows did he do? 
[02:16:00]  Did he do Jesus Christ?  I did Jesus Christ Superstar for eight...  Six months.  Oh, man.  Who were you on that?  I was...  Jesus.  Jesus.  Yeah, look at him.  Who else could he play?  He could have been Judas, I guess.  Well, he got the better tunes.  Yeah, yeah.  He got the...  The devil always gets the better songs.  Do you hate being in a play, though?  Because Colin...  I mean, for a stand-up, it's different.  But Colin hated it because he said he was doing the same thing.  And Stephen Lynch didn't like it because he's like, you can't deviate.  And you go a little cuckoo.  You do, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, at the end of Mr. Hyde, I was kind of...  Losing it. 
[02:16:30]  Taking it off the stage a bit.  Yeah.  And I heard, you know, Jesus Christ, Ted Neely, who played it for like 15 years or something,  you know, he'd be out by the bus at midnight in his gown, like, blessing people.  And people were like, dude, the play ended a couple hours ago.  Go to your room, you fucking lunatic.  There's a lot of this, like, padding on heads at that play.  15 years of the same fucking gig.  That's got to be brutal.  Has to have lost his mind.  Wasn't he on, like, the original cast album or something?  Yeah.  That's like... 
[02:17:00]  Fuck.  I think he just did it last summer again.  Jesus Christ!  And they don't change it either.  No, no, no.  It's not like the play changes every couple years.  That's not something you could change.  That's it.  That one's like one of those, no interpretations, my friend.  You do it the same way we heard it back in the 60s.  And I told him, I go, look, I can do this for four months.  I can't do this for any longer than that.  That's when it's like...  It starts just getting to you.  Right.  And they go, well, you gotta do it for six months.  I go, listen, I'm telling you, something bad is gonna happen. 
[02:17:30]  You're not gonna want me after four.  I am telling...  I know me.  And the fifth month got kind of weird.  Six months sucked.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking...  It was horrible.  You just wanted out.  I got out.  Yeah.  It had to be nice knowing there was a finish line, though.  Like, you knew when you were done, so...  No, you know what?  I'm...  I...  No.  I told them I could only do it six months.  They wanted me for a year.  That was it.  Wow.  That was it.  Holy shit.  So I lost my mind, like, in the six months. 
[02:18:00]  And how many shows is that?  Because that's...  Eight shows a week.  Eight shows a week.  Never missed any.  Holy shit.  You didn't miss one.  Not one.  That's crazy, because especially that double...  Matinee shows.  Well, I would be in my bed, like, at 11 in the morning going,  I can't fucking do this.  This is fucking insane.  And I'd be going...  I'd look at...  I'd go...  I just want to go back to bed.  I don't know what I do.  You gotta get up and sing.  Fucking...  And then I'd go...  And then I'd think about my understudy getting my money. 
[02:18:30]  Oh.  And I'd go, fuck that, man.  I'd go, get me a fucking coffee.  Let's fucking do this.  You know, the understudies are rooting against you, too.  They have to be.  Totally.  But could you also imagine the audience that come there to see Sebastian singing,  and you gotta fucking, like...  And in the part of, you're like, wait, wait, no, no, no.  You know how many people went just to see you?  Yeah.  That's cool, dude.  Thank you.  Did you lose any Jekyll and Hyde stuff in the house?  Yes, I did.  I lost some big placards. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Big placards.  Big displays.  Did you save stuff from that?  Yes.  I would have.  I got tons of shit.  Fuck yeah.  I save everything, man.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I got on my wall a fucking kiss.  It's from the side of a bus.  It was only a hundred bucks, but it was a bus ad from, like, the late 70s.  And the bus.  He's actually got the bus in it.  And the people on it.  They're just so sick of watching me jerk off alone every night.  No, it's from Alive, too.  It was when they did the garden tour.  My dad took me to one of those shows.  It was December 16th or 17th of fucking 77. 
[02:19:30]  77 or 78, yeah.  It's like the weird little shit.  Wow, that's killer.  But half of it's getting, you said you lost magazine stuff, but all the magazines are gettable  again on eBay and stuff.  Fucking all that stuff is replaceable.  That's a pain in the ass, though.  He doesn't want to deal with that shit.  Nah, but it's most of us replaceable.  I don't want to deal with that shit.  You don't want to deal with that shit.  You just want, I want eBay.  I'll fucking get Cree magazine.  Right.  I want to replace my stuff.  More importantly, you were in Celebrity Fit Club, my friend.  Yeah, that was important.  No, that was actually a nightmare to film, but I'm very glad I did the show. 
[02:20:00]  That Harvey guy was really cool, and I just learned a lot about eating and not eating.  Were you out of shape?  Were you really out of shape?  I was, yeah.  You kept the weight off, man.  I did, yep, yep.  I came in there.  I was, you know, I was married for a million years, and I was convincing my wife wanted  to be fat.  I think, no, I think it's like, have another taco, dude.  You're not going out tonight.  Oh, there you go.  How much weight did you put on? 
[02:20:30]  How much did I lose?  Yeah, yeah.  You're heaviest now.  I was like 6'4".  Jesus.  And when I came in there, I was like 230, which is the most I ever was.  And now I'm like 198.  Oh, okay.  I'm 35.  Yeah, 230.  That was big.  That's when you turn around and go, that's Sebastian Brown.  No, I know, I know.  I'm sorry.  Fuck, man.  I'm sorry.  I've been doing this a thousand years for fuck's sake.  I like to eat sometimes. 
[02:21:00]  I just thank God.  I've been doing this, and right on TV right now, it's Fat Elvis.  Was that me, dude?  That's actually a friend of ours, Rob Bartlett.  Real funny fucking guy.  That looks like me in 98.  You start avoiding mirrors.  I've been through that phase many times where you just don't look.  I can't look.  You know, I find a way to gauge how fat you are is the cock.  Look, I mean, if you can see it prominently, and if you're, it's like, where is it?  Well, from what I've heard about you, you can be 600 pounds and I have an issue. 
[02:21:30]  You're a legend.  Your cock is the stuff of legends.  It's Tommy Lee.  Sebastian supposedly has a big piece, too.  I heard you could fucking tie your hog.  No.  Is that not true?  All rumors.  Remember that Broadway musical, Puppetry of the Penis?  Yes.  We had those guys in.  You did?  Yeah.  I think we're gay now.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, that was a weird fucking segment, man.  I know.  But it was pretty impressive when the one guy made a fucking hamburger.  I was just thinking of that one.  I was impressed.  Dinosaurs. 
[02:22:00]  They make all kinds of weird things.  The Last Supper.  They made the Loch Ness Monster.  I'm trying to remember all the shit they used to make.  And I blocked it out.  Yeah, I know.  I really was just kind of, it's radio.  What the fuck are you doing with playing with your dick on the radio?  Yeah.  And we're looking at this.  Two guys in a room.  A bunch of guys.  Well, this is how bad radio is.  We booked those guys.  And we're like, all right, we're going to get chicks to come down and check this out.  So it's less gay for us, right?  And remember, the lawyers got involved and said, no, you're not allowed to have chicks. 
[02:22:30]  And then the next thing you know, it's a room full of guys watching these.  I don't get it, though.  Probably afraid of harassment.  Sexual harassment.  But they do the play in front of chicks.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And we said, look, if they volunteer to come in and check it out, what's the problem?  But they found a problem.  So it was just all us guys looking at other guys naked, making hamburgers on their penises.  You're a friend of Axl, right?  Yeah.  So you guys, you must be happy they just got nominated for the Hall.  Is this the first nomination for Guns N' Roses?  Yeah.  How can they be nominated before Kiss?  Like, that's crazy. 
[02:23:00]  We said that this morning.  I was screaming about fucking Kiss.  It just makes no sense.  If you know anything about music, you put Kiss in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Well, I mean, just even for their influence on, like, theater and all the other bands.  Right, of course.  And how recognizable they are.  And, you know, they got fucking, you know, Kiss Chili.  Yeah, right.  They got Kiss everything.  Yeah, what's the criteria if you're not letting them in?  Right.  You know?  Right?  Yeah.  It's snobbery.  It really is music snobbery.  And all you guys, like Sebastian Bach, love Kiss. 
[02:23:30]  Sebastian Bach.  I know, sorry.  Sebastian Bach, love Kiss.  You hear it all the time from musicians.  Dave Grohl.  Like, you know.  Right.  I don't know.  Who else did I hear?  Fucking the guys from Jane's Addiction, I heard.  Lane Staley.  I watched an interview with him.  He was saying what a big influence Kiss was.  Right.  All those fucking guys.  Yeah.  Well, Lane Staley started in a glam rock type of band before the whole grunge thing happened,  right?  Yeah.  He was a cool guy.  He was a very good guy.  Fuck, I love Lane's voice.  God damn it.  He had an incredible voice.  Yeah.  I fucking love it. 
[02:24:00]  And he doesn't get a lot of credit for influencing everybody.  Like, with that low...  Hey.  And like, everybody cloned him.  Everyone started doing that.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  And nobody's...  You know, like...  But no one did it like him.  No, he had the magic.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And he had the range, too.  Yes, Rooster's amazing.  Wood.  Yeah.  Down in a Hole.  That whole fucking...  Down in a Hole.  I like the Dark shit.  The whole Unplugged album, too, is just amazing.  Best Unplugged ever. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Better than Nirvana, which was a close second for me.  That was a good one.  I like Neil Young Unplugged.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That was really good.  It is a good one.  I don't even think I've seen that one.  Oh, that's amazing.  Long May You Run and shit.  That's fucking amazing.  How much long may you run and shit?  That's the fucking...  Not in that order.  That's the G.G. Allen box set version.  Long May You Run and Shit.  G.G. never did an Unplugged. 
[02:25:00]  That would have been great.  Everything he did was unplugged.  Have you ever seen any footage of that?  Yes.  Disgusting.  Like the DVD where he's doing a song, and there's a mosh pit, and the guy just runs up,  bang, fucking punches him in the face.  I'm like, this is entertaining.  Yeah, it really was fun to watch.  Not musically.  Probably not very good at just audio.  You need the video there, too.  Yeah, what if he warmed up his voice before he went on stage?  Eat a banana, take a shit.  All right, good.  Ready to go.  It's rough to go to a show where you might have shit thrown at you.  Oh, my God.  I don't know how you become a fan of a band like that. 
[02:25:30]  He's running scales in the dressing room.  It might end with shit on our face, but God damn, it's great.  Yeah, how was the show?  Well, he threw duty on me and hit himself with a bottle.  Oh, good.  Sorry, we missed that.  Maybe I would watch from the back of the room.  I don't know.  Oh, that's funny, man.  Fuck these guys.  You're right.  Fuck these guys.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  That one I never got.  I never got the Gigi Allen.  That's heavy.  That's heavy shit.  With Merle?  His brother Merle.  Merle with the backwards Hitler mustache.  Yeah.  They had a really weird sexual relationship, too, which they talked about. 
[02:26:00]  It was a really weird thing.  The documentary was terrific.  Pretty sure, yeah.  I got a chick.  I think, though, I'm just making that up.  I appreciate a sexual relationship.  I don't know.  I wanted to, because you touched on getting divorced.  That's wonderful.  It must have been.  It's there.  Well, that was back in 1999 and shit like that, so I'm well past it.  Oh, you did it?  But I did that stint and had to pay, like, so much money.  And it's like, I never remember her being behind a mic, you know, doing the fucking radio show. 
[02:26:30]  My chick is saying that, like, I want all this stuff on Celebrity Fit Club.  She's saying that she lost the weight with me.  And I go, how the fuck do you figure that?  I go, I go.  Oh, shit.  She goes, yeah, because, like, I was with you and I was cooking you food and, you know, I was with you and you were working out.  And, like, that's all half mine because I lost that weight with you.  I go, you've lost that weight with me?  What the fuck? 
[02:27:00]  You know, it just becomes incomprehensible.  But you just throw your hands up and go, fuck it.  Yeah, at one point you just say, fuck it.  I go, what is it going to take to just end this?  I just want to thank you for losing my weight for me because I feel way better.  I just, you're very dedicated and diligent and I'm so glad you did that for me because now I'm skinny and I can't, I couldn't, it's, thank you so much.  Yeah.  Did she take credit for you putting it on, though?  They never take credit for the bad stuff.  Right?  It's always the good shit.  How about all the tacos and fucking, yeah.  Did you make out all right or you got killed? 
[02:27:30]  I don't know if you want to talk about it.  I'm all right.  You did all right?  Yeah.  I got a new CD coming out today.  Fair enough.  It's kicking and screaming.  The single's fucking great.  Thank you.  I haven't heard, we didn't get any advanced copies.  I got it right here.  We're definitely going to play something off it.  Oh, cool, man.  Oh, hell yeah.  I didn't hear the rest of the, I heard like little pieces of all the songs because I fucking downloaded it last night at like one o'clock in the morning.  Thanks, buddy.  Of course.  He did it for free, though.  We'll save hands.  Come on.  He's got a source.  He's got a source.  I'm a very bad handshaker.  I always grab the wrong way. 
[02:28:00]  Like if it's a black guy, I just give him like the fucking horrible, I grab his thumb like a child.  I'm terrible.  I should just wave at people for a cross.  You did this one, dude?  Give me that.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  That's old school.  My hands are too small.  I have to grab an Asian cock and do that.  I can't do it with a man's hand.  I can't do that with an adult hand.  My little hands are too tiny.  Were you threatened when fucking, I meant to ask you before, when like grunge came along,  were you guys worried about that?  Were you afraid it was going to hurt business or did you kind of just go with it? 
[02:28:30]  Well, you know, I can't really base what I do on other bands.  You know, I just kind of do what I do.  Right.  But, you know, I remember we couldn't get our video on MTV and shit like that.  Oh, shit.  And that was shocking.  I was like, what?  I remember calling up Rick Krim, the president of MTV, with all my buddies.  Like, we're all drunk and fucking in my living room.  I'm like, I want to see the fucking video.  All right?  Fuck.  Me and my friends are fucking here, and we want to see the fucking video. 
[02:29:00]  And he's like, oh, man.  What the fuck?  Oh, yeah.  I called a bunch of people like that.  Doug Morris, president of Atlantic.  What the fuck?  So you're not celebrating the 20th anniversary of Nevermind, are you?  You're not celebrating Nevermind's 20th anniversary.  Well, I mean.  That thing hit and fuck, bands went away.  Yeah.  You guys didn't go away.  Well, I'm here right now.  Right.  You know.  But a lot of bands were gone within a week. 
[02:29:30]  Holy shit.  It was fucking rough.  It's got to be rough when you see other videos, because you start to feel like you had a  relationship with MTV, and it's like, what the fuck?  Where's the loyalty?  Yeah.  Well, because you feel like you helped build the brand, you know, a little bit.  Yeah.  Right.  And they don't have any loyalty.  Well, now they don't even play music, so.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Well, videos are kind of.  What?  I just shot three videos.  Oh, did you really?  I'm rocking.  And you get.  I'm rocking. 
[02:30:00]  The thing is, though, you can pop up YouTube and watch, you know.  Yes.  Yeah, that's where they're all going.  They have millions of plays, too.  So it's not, you know, you don't have to go to MTV.  Man, these videos get hit on YouTube.  Holy shit.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  How do you conceptualize a video?  Because to me, it was always, it always seemed like it would be embarrassing to go, you know,  to like be mock singing, or then they go, no, no, stop, redo it.  And you go, okay.  And people are watching.  I'm so afraid of being looked at by people.  Like Ricky Gervais' video.  End of, uh.  But that wasn't as bad because it was just him in a room alone.  Whenever I see singers doing something with like an audience around, knowing that that 
[02:30:30]  has to be coordinated, I'm always amazed at the fucking balls it takes to do it.  That would terrify me.  So you're a Kiss fan when you were a little kid.  Sure.  So you must have got your friends over when you were a little boy in your bedroom with  tennis rackets, jumping off your bed and fucking rocking out and fucking, you didn't  do all that?  No, my friend with Budweiser shorts that smelled like mothballs was making me blow them.  Yeah, they were blowing each other in the porch.  I listened to Kiss as a way to escape my fucking horrible sexual nonsense. 
[02:31:00]  Burn anything in your mouth in the pool.  Yeah, exactly.  I would just go back after that and just curl up and listen to Love Em, Leave Em under the fucking  sheets.  I wasn't anticipating that answer.  Hope the bad man goes away.  Wow, okay.  That's a hell of an answer.  But I guess it is.  You answered your question though, Sebastian.  I guess you're play acting in a way.  Like I guess in a way.  Just having fun.  Yeah.  Like goofing off.  It's a good gig.  So will the guy come to you and go, look, this is what I want you to do for your video  or will you go, hey, look, let's try this.  And this is kind of what I'm seeing.  Well, we just shot three videos in one day for the same amount of money that was like the catering 
[02:31:30]  budget on a Skid Row video.  Wow.  Well, we used to spend like, you know, monkey business video, I think was like 260 grand.  Now that was, I mean, there was a million dollar video.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, here's a moment when I knew grunge was fucking shit up.  One exact moment.  We put out a record called Subhuman Race in 95, 94, 95.  And you know the famous director, movie director, F. Gary Gray? 
[02:32:00]  You've heard of him?  I don't know.  He's a famous director now of movies and he's amazing.  F. Gary Gray.  He came in and he did all the Dr. Dre videos, like where the fucking, like the cane turned  into a skull and all that, like really expensive, you know, videos.  And he came to Atlanta and said, I want to do a rock video.  And they played him their new stuff and he picked our song, My Enemy, off that to do  his video.  And we had a big meeting and he was going to shoot it and everything.  And then Atlanta said, we're not paying for that video. 
[02:32:30]  It's like, you fucking assholes.  I was like, no, we're not paying for that.  That's like Scorsese wanting to direct your script and then you last minute go, no, we're  going to go down the script.  That's literally what happened.  Wow.  Like, so that was the moment.  But back then videos were different though.  Back then that was the marketing tool aside from radio.  Now fucking, you can hear something and just download off the iPhone and you have it in  a second.  If you have an iPhone right now, you can literally go to iTunes and download this album and have  it in three minutes.  It's like, it's a different fucking game. 
[02:33:00]  Different world.  Yeah, man.  Fucking YouTube videos.  None of it means, no one watches videos.  They actually do though.  Like, I mean.  On TV, I mean.  No, on YouTube.  Like, my new video's got like half a million.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah.  On YouTube.  That's great because it's like on demand.  You don't have to sit.  I remember watching MTV sitting there waiting for a video you wanted to see to come on.  Yeah.  And, you know, you're going to sit through crap.  You're like, oh no, sting, fuck.  Sting again.  And then, you know, then the video you wanted to see would come on.  But now you can just pop in. 
[02:33:30]  We don't wait for shit anymore, right?  There's no waiting anymore.  Sebastian.  Yeah.  They're saying you have to leave in five minutes.  Is that true?  I don't know.  I don't want to fuck up your time.  You got other shit going on today?  You know what's crazy?  I'm doing like seven or eight stations on Sirius today.  Yeah.  And I'm not doing Hair Nation.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  This is the fucking Hair Nation.  You have the hair.  What the fuck?  You have the Hair Nation.  The channel's named after them.  I'm like, what? 
[02:34:00]  They play me every 20 minutes in that fucking station.  Yeah, why the fuck wasn't they?  Do they not?  I don't know.  We're doing an interview after.  That's crazy.  On the boneyard.  Yeah.  Well, that's cooler.  Oh, of course.  But I mean, Hair Nation is the station.  I got a bone, too.  He's got a big bone.  A big bone.  I know.  It's so depressing.  He just doesn't want to talk about his big bone.  I don't blame him.  I wouldn't brag, either.  No.  I'm lying.  It's all I would do.  That's why I would just walk in and go cock and give a size.  I know it is, but only a guy with an average dick would say that he would do that. 
[02:34:30]  Like, that's how you know I have a fucking very average penis.  I could talk about this for hours.  If everybody wants to listen, believe me, stay tuned.  I'll just keep talking.  Too much cock talk.  I know.  I know.  Sorry.  But we were talking.  You missed it before.  We had a transsexual caller.  And we talk about vaginas a lot, but I get a lot of shit for that.  I'm just rambling.  That doesn't matter.  It's all right.  Good.  That's what we do on this show.  It's called The Show.  Yeah.  We come in and ramble.  It really is fucking nonsense.  So you're going to be touring there, Sebastian?  We should get some of this info.  Irving Plaza on November 10th. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  A bunch of East Coast dates.  And then we're going to Europe in January and February.  Who are you going out with?  Headlining right now.  And I might play some gigs with.  No, I mean, who are you going out with right now?  Huh?  You're single, aren't you?  I actually have a girlfriend.  Oh, is that a bomb?  That was a fucking bummer.  But it seems to change day to day.  Yeah.  One of those things.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what's up.  Would you ever get married again?  That's good.  Uh, not anytime soon.  Okay.  We never understand the guy that jumps right back in. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no.  Like three, four times.  Why would you jump right back in?  See these guys get married three or four times?  It's like, no, fuck.  I could see myself doing that, but not anytime soon.  Are you guys fighting a lot?  I get mad, you know.  Why don't you go fuck some other fucking guy?  I've said that, but I was jerking off when I did.  Like, just tell me about it when you come back.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Have I lost my way.  Oh, goddamn.  I'm actually putting this in my calendar right now. 
[02:36:00]  November 10th.  Oh, I would check that out.  Oh, cool.  I really want to go see that.  Irving Plaza is a great fucking movie.  Irving Plaza.  Yeah, that is a great venue, man.  You can do a big cock speech.  You sure?  Cock, cock, cock, cock.  Here he comes.  Yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, before I bring out Sebastian, and then just sit on the stool and go,  you know, I don't know what happened.  I was small.  I didn't know any better.  20 minutes later.  I thought they would like me as people.  What an intro.  Crowd is silent.  Jaws on the ground.  Everyone's left.  Crowd goes mild.  Just one fat guy in the front just kind of weeping with me. 
[02:36:30]  It's an ugly moment.  Remember that time that, what's his name, set up the candles after our gig and lost the  whole fucking crowd?  Oh, Travis Meeks.  Fucking Dave Miller.  Travis Meeks, who has a great voice from Dave Miller.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A while ago.  We used to do these fucking knockout parties at these clubs, and then we would get somebody  to, you know, perform after us.  Electric Factory in Philly.  Electric Factory.  Yeah.  And we had, I mean, they were rocking.  We had them in a good spot, and then Travis Meeks comes out and just took 20 minutes setting  up his candles, and by the time he started, no one was left.  They couldn't wait anymore. 
[02:37:00]  They all walked.  And we're looking at him like, what are you doing?  You're going to look.  Great.  I hope you enjoy the candlelight, you dummy.  We're like, you're losing the crowd.  You know, get out there.  How presumptuous is that?  That people are going to fucking stay there.  What happened to this?  Some crazy shit happened to that guy, though.  Yeah.  Some wild stuff.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually wondered about him recently.  I saw photos of him in like 2001 in studio.  Rumors, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Is he alive?  I don't know.  Is he alive?  No, he is.  That's bad when you got to say, is he alive?  He is.  He is. 
[02:37:30]  I'm so out of it, though.  I'm a fucking pop culture idiot.  Yeah.  So I don't know why you're not doing Hair Nation.  Maybe they don't have any live.  A lot of times they don't have any live jocks.  Sometimes they might have to have someone who pre-tapes.  Oh, right, right, right.  They couldn't do it.  With that, they are saying he has to go because he's got a lot of interviews.  Let's play something, man.  Thank you.  Right on.  What's the name of the album?  It's called Kicking and Screaming.  It's the name of the album.  It's heavy, man.  I fucking like it a lot.  It's about kicking ass and screaming rock and roll.  Play the title track, number one, if you can.  Is that the one we want to play?  Yeah.  Sure.  Right on.  Okay.  Thank you.  You've got to come back.  It's been way too long. 
[02:38:00]  Thank you, guys.  Yeah, I love having Sebastian.  Thank you, man.  Thanks.  Fucking animal, dude.  Come back before Irving Plaza.  Okay.  I'll come that day.  I can bring my band and we can play.  Oh, we would love that.  I would love it, too.  That would be phenomenal.  We would fucking love that.  And you guys are invited over to my house where you can go swimming in my basement.  Bring your scuba gear.  With that, it's Sebastian Bach's new song, man.  Check it out.  Kicking and Screaming.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  Yes! 
[02:38:30]  I'm a rich and I'm crazy  In a world that I've never known  And my life is so rearranging  When you win or can you ever know  I gotta get out 
[02:39:00]  And tear this whole face to the ground  In a night where they keep you screaming  Thinking through the past remains  And here has a future  I can make me go insane  Where we go, we can never sell 
[02:39:30]  Just take my hand and lead me through this hell  You whispered friendly me  And I'm already taking now  You can't imagine the horror  That you saved me from somehow 
[02:40:00]  I gotta get out  I gotta get out  I gotta get out  From under the weight of this world  And the night will be kicking and screaming  Thinking through the past remains  And here has a future  I can make me go insane  Where we go, we can never tell 
[02:40:30]  Just take my hand and lead me through this hell  And here has a future  And here has a future  And here has a future  In a night where they keep you screaming 
[02:41:00]  Thinking through the past remains  And here has a future  And here has a future  And here has a future  I can make me go insane  Where we go, we can never tell  Just take my hand and lead me through this hell  And lead me through this hell 
[02:41:30]  Sirius XM  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question  We got some special guests in the studio  Don't we, Anthony?  Yes! 
[02:42:00]  Brother Joe's here  Their niece and nephew  And Patrick  Yeah, Patrick and Joe  You got your nephew and niece in the studio  And yes, little Warren  Hi, Warren  Warren was telling us about buses  Yeah, apparently  And Layla, of course  Hi, Layla!  I'm silent  Layla won't speak up  Can you talk on the mic?  Warren was telling us all about buses  He really likes buses  Kids are hilarious  I don't think  They just get one subject for like a month  Yeah, and that's it  And that's all they talk about  See if we'll talk about buses 
[02:42:30]  And buses  I don't know if he will  He was very chatty when he came in  But I don't think he's going to talk on mic now  Warren  Warren  Warren  It's just a microphone  He's not going to talk now  Is he?  He's distracted by the window  Oh yeah, well I am too  Yeah  You know why?  Because it's the way out of here  Every day  Kenny's sitting out there staring at him like a creep  Oh, that's all he does  Why won't Kenny smile?  It's a kid  I don't know  Hey Warren  What kind of buses did you see today? 
[02:43:00]  Good luck  Warren  He's just really bothered by Kenny right now  Oh boy  Kenny won't smile back  Kenny will do that to people  Close the curtain  Hi, how you doing?  Glad to have you here  Close the curtain so the kid doesn't have to  He's making sure little Warren's not a threat  Yeah, I'll show him  I will stare him down  There we go  Until the threat is over  Most any woman would have given it up for Sebastian Bach  Layla is a diva 
[02:43:30]  Yeah  She didn't even turn her head toward the camera  You got a good picture with him?  Yeah  Yeah  I got a shot  Sebastian Bach was great on the show  And she just turned her head away?  No, she  Yeah, she tucked her head in the crook of my neck  And that was that  And then she likes her rockers with no hair  Ah, yeah  Well, that's true  The shaved head look  Kids are hilarious  They don't talk when like  On cue  When you want them to  But like during the entire break  He was just like  Well, transit buses  And he goes 
[02:44:00]  And then I saw kids get off a school bus  And the tour buses  They have no top  And the windows  No windows  And like  Boy, you  Jimmy goes  This kid doesn't like buses  He loves them  He loves buses  Excellent impersonation of Warren  By the way, Anthony  Oh, yeah  He just like  Warren  He's not going to say hi to us?  What is he staring at now, Patrick?  His reflection  He's just kind of chilling  He's really just hiding away from everything that's going on  Being shy  Yeah, just being shy 
[02:44:30]  It's too bad  Because he gave us some pretty stuff  He's got his hair all spiked up today  He's rocking  That's his look  That's his look, yeah  And then Layla doesn't talk, right?  No, but if she would  She would plug my gig over at  Oh, yeah  Oh, you're also doing the Tampa Improv this Thursday through Saturday?  Oh, why?

Williams  We won't ruin this relationship  This one we won't ruin  Why should this be any different than  I want to talk to Warren, man  I know  Warren is so  Who's Warren's personality during the break?  Warren's hilarious  But he's not talking too much  Warren  That's his sister  What kind of bus did you see?  Tell me about the buses

You should talk into it yourself  What happened?  What happened?  What did you see?  What buses?  Did you see tour buses?  Yeah  Warren, come on  Kids are the worst 
[02:47:30]  Talk into it  They just don't know  They just don't know  They never do anything  When you want to  You like riding a bus or something?

[02:48:30]  In their kiddie seats  In the back of my SS Trailblazer black with silver  They were going off  There is something to be said, though  About well-behaved children  Who know the adults are talking  And who aren't jumping in  I kind of like that, too  They just happen to be raised properly  Got to get them talking  At some point  The old hickory stick helps  Yeah, sometimes a good savage beating  Is all the time  You want to sing a song, Warren?  Yeah 
[02:49:00]  Sing a song  With a microphone  Do you know Yellow Submarine?  I guess we're just waiting for your mom to show up  And then the intervention will start  Oh, that would be a great one  That's great  That's funny  Sorry about that  It's hilarious  Now, everybody had to write down something to tell Anthony  Right  About how his behavior

[02:50:00]  Yeah, he's doing the guitar riff  That's probably why he's shy  He sees Kenny  He's like, there's a monster outside the window 
[02:50:30]  He can't even smile at a kid  What's wrong with him?  Oh, he's getting off the couch  He's walking in the room now  He's walking in the room  Kids are weirdos  They're just odd  They're just odd  They're weird little things  What's he  What are the words?

I get to talk more than two-minute intervals  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah  Sixth Avenue in Manhattan  There's no fucking reason  You shouldn't be  There's no reason  It's okay  I feel bad  It's kidding  I feel so good all the time  It's like when you're on Sixth Avenue in New York  And your phone is dropping calls  It's like, it's just  There's something enraging about that  It's so stupid  You just feel violated  It's not happening in Manhattan 
[02:57:30]  No, it's not cool  I like the shirt  Brooklyn is New York  Brooklyn is New York  This is my new shirt line  Really?  Yeah, man  Me and my partner, Rob Walker  We have, the name of the line  It's called  Just a Dude from Brooklyn  And we got various different little things  We got Brooklyn is New York  We got Brooklynaires  Brooklyn Bread  Made Fresh Daily  Brooklyn is not a borough  It's a blood type  BK positive  You know what I mean?  So, yeah  If you wanted to check it out, man  You can go to 
[02:58:00]  Thou Art Genius  On Twitter  And we make it happen for you  You happy about the Nets?  Brooklyn Nets?  I'm ecstatic  You don't have to be  I'm ecstatic, man  I'm ecstatic  I cannot wait  Are you going to start rooting for them?  Are you going to leave them?  Are you a Knicks fan?  I mean, you know  You have to be  You know, I'm born and raised  You got to be a Knicks fan  You know, I'm  I'm really happy with  What Melo's bringing to the team  My man  I'm bad with names, man  I am too  The guy  Bill Bradley  Not Bill Bradley  Shut up, the pusher 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, I'm very bad  Dick Barnett  I'm back away  I do this all day  No, I don't  I stopped watching a lot of professional sports  But I kind of think it's cool that the Nets are going to Brooklyn  I'll at least follow that  I don't know if I'll be a fan  But, you know  I mean, yeah, exactly  I mean, what do I got to lose?  You know what I mean?  They just brought a hipness to the team  To Brooklyn  Holy shit  Swagger, yeah  It's a good thing for Brooklyn  Absolutely, I think, definitely  We saw each other at the Curb Your Enthusiasm premiere 
[02:59:00]  We were eating  At, uh  What was it?  At the Porterhouse Steakhouse  They had a big after party  Boy, did we eat  Oh, like pigs  I had three desserts  Oh, yummy  Four lobster tails  Oh, yeah  Oh, that's crazy  And you were talking to somebody about Brooklyn  And you were almost arguing  I think with your friend  About the difference between Brooklyn and Manhattan  Yeah, she made me mad  You know, it's my guess  She came with me  You know, but, you know  She lives in Harlem  And, you know, she's like  I don't go to Brooklyn  There's nothing to do with Brooklyn  I'm like, yeah, there is  There's life  And you live in Brooklyn 
[02:59:30]  You know, like  We don't go to Brooklyn  To necessarily be entertained  But it's just, you know  And it's just that  And I'm like, you know  Brooklyn is fine  The only problem we got  Is all you transplants  Coming and taking up  All the real estate  We was good  You know  It's like the new hipster place  Though, like Williamsburg  Brooklyn is where all the hipsters go to  They don't  Everyone's moving to Brooklyn  Yeah, it used to be like  The East Village  And now I think it's all  That was cheaper  Was cheaper, you're right  Because now they see you coming  So they're raising everything  Yeah  Oh, the second they make an area hip  Yeah  Yeah, and it's like 
[03:00:00]  Oh, it's inexpensive  No, not anymore  Damn landlord  Yeah, that shit coming  Yeah, I see it coming  Yeah  I see it coming  Where in Brooklyn?  I'm sorry  I was just saying  I think everybody should  That lives in New York  Should probably reside in Brooklyn  At some point in their life  No!  Just to kind of get  Get that  What are you doing  No, I'm just saying  Like it's  Because it is a whole different head over there  It really is, man  It's totally different  You know, I just  I don't know  You know, I always say  When I leave Brooklyn  I leave New York  You know, it's just something about  You know, removing yourself from the island 
[03:00:30]  You know, Manhattan  And then looking at it  It kind of, you know  It's over there  It's inspiring to look at  You know  It's the dream  But you ain't in it  You know what I mean?  I can remove myself  You can't see it for what it's worth  When you're always in it  You know what I mean?  And I don't know  I just love  I love Brooklyn to death  I spent no time in Brooklyn in my life  Like I literally  All I know is that  In Brooklyn and especially Queens  My fucking GPS  Actually just puts its hands up  And goes  I'm lost  I literally have ridden around Queens  On fucking Northern Boulevard 
[03:01:00]  I mean there's trannies in that area  It's a coincidence  You know  I'm telling your daddy  And they can never give you the address right  Because they're all speaking  Fucking broken English  And first of all  You got 23rd Street  23rd Avenue  23rd Drive  23rd, you know  A road  I'm like  Make up your freaking mind  In Queens, right?  Yeah, Queens  Queens is like that  And then Brooklyn is weird  Because Brooklyn has like  A kind of a grid  Like Manhattan  But then it'll switch 45 degrees  And  Yeah, it'll go  Yeah, it's like  Oh, if I keep going this way 
[03:01:30]  I'm heading north  So that's cool  And then all of a sudden  You're heading east  And you're like  Wait a minute  What just happened?  You think you're going one way  You know you're in a whole different direction  Yeah, so you could get fucked up  Driving around in Brooklyn  Kings Plaza and Eastern Park  Will catch you out there like that  Yeah  Where in Brooklyn do you live?  Are you from an area of Brooklyn  That I would be well received in or no?  No  Well received  I'm from East Flatbush, Brooklyn  Oh yeah, shit  A lot of culture there  I've driven through there at night sometimes 
[03:02:00]  Did not pay attention to one traffic light  Just kept going  Kept it moving  Keep it moving  Why stop?  You catch a run on Notion Avenue  Man, take it all the way down  Just keep going  Why stop?  Why for what?  For what?  We want to get car jacked, really  You know  And the cops understand  Yeah, no one's going to give you a ticket  They're not going to pull us over  They say white guy  Stared shit  Let's go through reds  Let them go  Where are the drugs?  Why are you here?  Digging  What were you buying?  Right  They just let us go, man  Especially if you have such blonde hair 
[03:02:30]  That would literally be like a fucking  Like a lighthouse light  Red flag  Are you still there?  No, I'm still in Brooklyn, no doubt  But I'm in Williamsburg now  Oh, you're in Williamsburg  Yeah, I turn into a hipster  Well, you know  You can give back  But you can give back by going there  And giving back  You don't have to stay  Where you were born and raised sometimes  Yeah, yeah  Someone always told me  The trick is not leaving  The trick is leaving  And being welcome back  You know what I mean  Yeah, that makes sense 
[03:03:00]  Yeah  I like the shirt, though  Thank you  I'd wear that  Yeah, I would too  I'd wear that shit  Hopefully, Michael brought some swag for all of us  Oh, no, no, no, no  Oh, no free shirts?  What's wrong with you?  No, definitely, yes, yes, yes  No, definitely free shirts  We love free shit  We love free shit  All right  But if you don't want to rep Brooklyn  I dig it  But just a dude from  We're going to make that universal, man  It could be just a dude from Pakistan  Just a dude from Israel  Just a dude from Germany  It's going to be worldwide  But the name of the company  Is just a dude from Brooklyn 
[03:03:30]  Because, you know  That's basically what we are  Yeah, I would promote Brooklyn  I mean, I like Brooklyn  A lot of people I love  Come from Brooklyn  Yeah  So, yeah, I just  I never went there  I used to work Pips  On Sheepshead Bay  I think it was  Well, then you went  Yeah, but I forgot  We got to fix that, man  I got to invite you to Brooklyn, man  We'll take you around  You know what I mean  I would like that  Yeah  I'll get you frisk  I'll get you, you know  Stop  You know what I'm saying  Stop and frisk  You know  What do they say  What's the line about pockets? 
[03:04:00]  Empty your pockets  I want to turn your pockets  I have you turn my pockets  Turn your pockets  How humiliating  I'd have to go through that  And sharpen there, is there?  No  I don't mean by the cops  No, I know what you mean  Let me sharpen those pockets  Turn your pockets  Yeah, it's so embarrassing  It's so embarrassing  I would rather have a guy  Just jam a gun in my face  Than fucking rob me politely  Come on, let me just turn your pockets  What do you mean by that?  I don't understand  Who was it that told me  They got robbed like that  Where the guy is like  How about this?  I'm going to turn your pockets  And whatever I find  I keep 
[03:04:30]  Whatever I find is mine  But he didn't hurt him  He politely robbed him  And they both knew  If you resist  I'm going to knock your teeth out  It's not going to be as polite  As it probably would have been  Yes  Have you been robbed?  Absolutely  Absolutely  Absolutely  Yeah, back in the day  Coming from home  Because I went to school  Downtown Brooklyn  In a western house  So we had to ride the two train  Coming back into Flatbush  And there were two stops  That you prayed  That you would survive  And that was Atlantic Avenue  Train Station  And then Franklin Avenue  Train Station  And I had to go through 
[03:05:00]  Both of them  So yeah  I've been robbed  A few times on a train  So those are bad  People getting off  Or guys getting on  It didn't matter  You didn't want to be  In Atlantic Avenue  Train Station  Or Franklin Avenue  Train Station  Just waiting for those doors  To close again  Close, close, close, close  Close, close, close  We used to do that  As white guys  Jamaica Station  Was the one for us  Don't get on, don't get on  Going back out to Long Island  Close, close, close, close, close  Close, close, close, close  Okay  We're good again  But where's Atlantic Avenue  And where's the other one?  Coney Island, right?  No, Atlantic Avenue  Is downtown Brooklyn  And Franklin Avenue 
[03:05:30]  Is like  I guess you would call it  Crown Heights  Okay  Crown Heights, yeah  And they were both scary areas  Very scary  Are they still?  No, no, no, no  Atlantic Avenue  Is, you know  They got it doing  The cabaret down there  Yeah  Oh, okay  They've cleaned things up  Pretty good  They taped that up  Really nicely  So where would be  Where would be a train stop  That I should be concerned about?  And by I  I mean a guy who's in  You know  Awful shape  And is a terrible actor  Well, the one at Coney Island  Is that bad?  It's pretty bad  Yeah, I don't take this subway much  Shout out to CI  Yeah, I still ride the train, man 
[03:06:00]  I take the  I take the  I take the 2-3  I get off at 72nd Street  And I have  I really do  I take the train schedule  Of an old Jewish woman  With a train  That space of track  Is when the trains actually work  Smooth sailing  As soon as you get to Harlem  The air condition goes off  The lights work  The lights go out  Yeah, yeah  Between 72nd and like 42nd  If there's a delay  The conductor will apologize  To everybody individually  I should have just quit  While I was ahead on that one 
[03:06:30]  I don't know much about the trains  But I have my train app  This is how people would know  I'm from New York  Like if I was in a bad area  I would just open it up  And show them my iPhone train app  And I would say  Yeah, that'll help  Especially since  I guess I heard on the news today  On the train  Your iPhone  Is one of the  Popular items  To just be grabbed  Right out of your hand  It is  Man, they jacking phones  Yeah, they're taking them  Like crazy now  You could just be  On the train  A lot of times  You're holding  You're just going like this  And bloop 
[03:07:00]  Right out of your hand  What are you going to do?  And the joke's on them  Because they won't be able  To make a call with it  It's like this damn AT&T  You know  Good luck with that  You get his paperweight  For 600 bucks  Feels good against your faces  Absolutely  How many times  Have you been on a roll  Like when you're in an argument  Something with my ex  We would argue  And I would be on  I would really be  Hitting home runs  Because she wasn't  Saying anything  And then I looked down  And I realized  That the call was dropped  Or you hear  Boop, boop, boop  And you don't know  What happened 
[03:07:30]  Or how long  You've been talking  Into nothing  And before you freak out  You want to know  Whose phone it was  And when you would look down  And see call fail  You would know  It was yours  But if you just saw  That the call was empty  You're like  Okay, it was probably  Their phone  So I won't break it  Don't you feel like  You've been bamboozled  When you know  When you  Because you know  When you call back  Oh, it's your phone  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Something's on with  Your phone  I'm on a hardwired phone  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I'm on one of those  I'm on a dial phone  At my grandmother's house  What are you talking about  I can't lose a signal  It's hardwired into the wall  Dummy  This is how bad  My iPhone was 
[03:08:00]  Last time you were  In our old studio  You had me call  Lance Reddick  Because we wanted  To get him on the show  So I called Lance Reddick  And he played  If anyone doesn't know  He was Lieutenant Daniels  On The Wire  And he actually called me back  And left me a couple of messages  And I was in LA  Not getting reception  And I forgot that I had  Those messages on my phone  And I just took my phone  And I threw it  And I broke it  On the bathroom floor  And I was like  You dummy  What's wrong with you  Fun messages on there  So AT&T really cost me  Some fun messages  Fun messages  You couldn't get them back  You couldn't get the messages  No because it's not like  A voicemail system  I don't think 
[03:08:30]  I don't know  Like a chip in the phone  That's too many  Yeah  I should  Yeah probably  Maybe I could have saved it  I think I still have it  In case they figure out  A way to get old messages  Off a phone you've broken  On a bathroom floor  By the way  We got Lance Reddick messages back  I know if I believe me  He wouldn't remember me  If I met him now  Did he do any scenes  With his shirt on  In that fucking show  I just watched it again  I can't believe  How many times he took his  I can think of the beginning  Yeah  That dude had like  The body of an Adonis  I wouldn't put my shirt on either  It was crazy  Yeah he was like  Yeah  Serious taking his shirt off 
[03:09:00]  In front of his wife  Or something  Yeah you know  Jesus  He's like you know  He's having lunch  I'm just gonna take my shirt off  He was trying to pitch scenes  Where the shirt could come off  I don't know  I think at a press conference  He would have his shirt off  At least open  You know  I'll give you four buttons up  That's about it  We'll go four buttons in  Oh fuck  You're doing great man  I love  Boardwalk Empire  I thought Boardwalk was next week  I didn't realize  It was a Sunday  I'm so annoyed that I missed  Are you in the first episode  Yeah a little bit  Okay cause I'm annoyed  That I missed it  But you did a great job on that

[03:15:00]  But then he said  No it's just my mom  You know wanting to  Wanting to talk to me  You were a little angry  Watching him on TV  Watching your son on TV  I'm not angry  I just love him too much  He'd be angry  I love him too much  I'm too proud of him  No  No anger here  What  I just want  He's okay  Ma you know you want me  To kill them  Clans members  I call him every day  I'm dying twice a day  I know he's tired of me  But  What's his mother to do  He's all right  At all times  Was that rough  Watching him  In the Wired 
[03:15:30]  Playing such a  Notorious character  Didn't he tell you  I never watched it  What  Not her cup of tea  You've never watched  The Wire  Not her cup of tea  No  My mother loved  Trapped in the Closet  Who was that  I like Last Thursday  I love Last Thursday  She loved the community  You know what I'm saying  She likes it easy  She doesn't want to see  She never saw you  In The Wire  No  Nah  I was mad Sunday night  Honey I didn't tell him  I was so mad  I couldn't even  Watch all that 
[03:16:00]  I said  What are they beating  With my car  And shooting in my car  I can't take it  I'm sorry  I can't take it honey  I can't take it  But you do realize  That's something man  You realize your son  Played one of the  Greatest characters ever  I know  On The Wire  I know but  I never seen it  I never watched it  No  Oh my god  She's so wild  She told David Simon  If you hurt my baby  I'm coming for you  Yeah oh yeah  And she meant it  Every word  You could tell  Hurt my child  Please  Uh uh uh uh  Oh we shouldn't  Yeah so don't watch  Season 6 
[03:16:30]  Yeah yeah  Steer clear  Yeah don't  You might want to  Steer clear of  New seasons  You should have told him  Watch this back  Oh I'm sorry  I meant season 5  Season 5  Season 5 right  She know what happened  But she ain't gonna watch it  No no no  So when you see Michael  You don't think Omar  Yeah  No no no no no  No she thinks her nice baby Michael  Her nice son  Do you watch him as Chalky?  I know  But I liked last year  But this year so far  When they had him  Shooting him down on the ground  He had to defend him  I said nope  When he got up  I said kill that  Kill that  I'm on the radio 
[03:17:00]  Yes it is  Yeah yeah yeah  My god please take me  No you're doing great  Believe me  You're doing great  It's so funny to hear this  Wow you  I'm just amazed by that  But that's a mom  That's a mom right there  But Michael what's that about?  She just doesn't want to see you  Playing a bad guy like that?  No no no no  I don't know why I don't like  That bought him a house  He wasn't raised like that  He wasn't raised on the street 
[03:17:30]  He wasn't raised to be  A person like that  But that's the role he's playing  I know it  But I can't help it  And you know it's just a character  But still it's very hard to watch  Your son like  I don't watch it  Tell you right now  I don't like it  I don't watch it  You did something right though  Because as a bad guy on the wire  There was some love in that character  Yeah  I said everybody tell me  But I never watched it  We all loved Omar  We were ready for him  By the end of that show  He made me question things  About myself  I don't know about Omar 
[03:18:00]  They always say  Oh that's your son  Yeah that's my baby boy  They say  Honey he is  He is  Okay I wouldn't know  I wouldn't know  I know he's a sweet boy  I'm going to be amazed  By that for days  But you know what  You might like the way  He played Omar  Because he plays a guy  Who carries a gun  And robs drug dealers  But is essentially  A very moral character  He played a very moral guy  I know all of that  But I just didn't like it  I just didn't like it  Not her cup of tea  Not her cup of tea  That's true 
[03:18:30]  Trying to sell a nice lady  On a crime drama  I know  Well mommy  I just want to be on  I just want to do this  On national radio  I always love my mama  Because my baby girl  I always love my mama  You brought me in this world  I love you mommy  And that's for the whole world  Of here  You my baby girl  For life  And guess what  I'll take you out  With your mess up  I'll take you out

[03:20:30]  She's got a yard  To change  She be chilling  She been there  For like 10 years now  That's awesome man  Yeah  Can she sleep in the quiet?  A lot of people leave the city  They need a TV on  Or something  They can't sleep  She don't want to hear  No more gunshots  She don't want to hear  No more bottle breaking  She saw some shit  Yeah  She did her biz  She had her belly full  And I didn't know  You had a son  Who's older  How old is your son?

Saturday no  Forget it  I just panicked  Alright that's cool man  I'm really amazed  That she's never seen you  In the role of Omar  She really can't take it  That it makes sense  Obviously  But it's so weird  When you think about it  Like just knowing  It's a character  But she feels so strongly  Toward you  To see you like that  Yeah  Instead of saying  Because most people 
[03:22:30]  Would watch and go  God damn  That is great acting  It's a great storyline  A great character  But she just goes  They're trying to hurt  My baby  Yeah  That's all she said  She didn't call me  She was leave  Last year  After every episode  Went off  She would call me  Boy  This Sunday  She didn't call me  And I was like  Uh oh  So I called her  I was like  What's up  You ain't called  You ain't called  To speak to Chalky  She was like  No you  You too busy for me  And I was like

[03:25:30]  325  Wow  Feet per second  Yeah it hurts  That'll break skin  Oh it will  Oh it will  And Spencer and fucking Roland  Excuse me  Roland are coming in here  And going  He's got to go right now  And rushing him out  While he's signing something  I know  Do you do that shit to Howard  Or other shows  I bet not  I need a blanket  I need a blanket  And a pillow  You need a blanket  Is that Jimmy talking  I need a blanket  And a pillow  Are you tired  Do you want to take a nap  What's the matter  Which blanket do you need 
[03:26:00]  You sleeping  Now she's just going to hide her face  What was that  Was it  I understand  I got it  You know  I understand  Which pillow  I think we're way over with him  So I think there was a panic  I actually thought  I know  But he's just signing something  And they're going to sign it later  I thought at one point  They fucking beat it  They were going to bring  Drag him out of there  Before they sign that  I would have got it  I was just going to  Turn my head  And not watch the horror  That would have unfolded  I wasn't worried about that  I know him  I could get that sign  It was just 
[03:26:30]  Yeah  Still though  Yeah it's just annoying  I kind of wanted a picture too  Yeah I know  It's a fucking  Yeah  They don't walk into other studios  Don't walk into the studio  I'm not mad at the publicist  But I'm telling them  They don't walk into the studio like that  How about that  Wave through the fucking thing  I don't want to yell at Liam  But I don't want to have him come in  And be tapped  Exactly  No  Jimmy's upset Liam  What's that  It's just annoying  The way they came in  I don't want everybody walking in  And grabbing people out  I know he had other things to do 
[03:27:00]  We know  But they don't do that in other studios  Well I actually  I'm here for you  Not for him  I'm not saying you  I'm saying whoever walked in  And dragged him out  No he's not blaming you  They don't walk into Howard's studio  I'm not trying to pass that  Are they walking into Howard's studio  And grabbing people out of there  What?  No  No of course they're not  What happened?  He was late for the other interview  I need Jimmy for Sebastian Bach  Sebastian's hanging down the hallway  And he did the show  That's all I need  Oh you're not even part of the Michael K.  I'm here booking Jimmy  Yeah  I'm not with Michael at all  I need this guy  Yeah  That's hilarious  I'll come down right now  Tell him I apologize  That's okay  I just saw you 
[03:27:30]  You guys were mid-interview  I just  No but they walk in  And pull him out  And mid-interview like that  Like I know it was a long thing  But they don't do that  To other shows on the platform  No of course not  But they feel free to do it here  Really really annoys me  Yeah I hear you Jimmy  I know he got the interview  And I don't  There's nothing else  I never got my picture with Omar  Michael K.  Oh that's right  You never got like I at least have one  First time I met him  First time I met him man  He's great  I tell him I'll be there in one minute  I apologize  Sorry Liam  I thought you were part of that  But am I wrong 
[03:28:00]  Is that annoying or what  Of course you're not wrong  And again it wasn't like  I knew I would get it signed  It wasn't about that  You're scaring Layla  I didn't mean to scare her  No  I don't want them  Walking into the studio anymore  Tell Roland never to fucking tap me  While I'm on the air again  Never  Roland tapped  I love Roland  I know it's his job  And they told him  Let's bring Roland in  I gotta go to  Where's Roland  I know that's his job  And they told him  Roland  I don't want anybody  Tapping me while I'm on the air  Let's settle this  Let's settle this  Fine fine sorry  But they don't do it to Howard  They don't do it to other shows  They do it to our show 
[03:28:30]  I don't want Spencer  And everyone just walking in here  Pulling somebody out  Alright right now  It's a no win situation  So I'm sorry  Oh  What's that  It's a no win  Because you're angry right now  So it's like  It happened so  It happened  There's nobody that promotes  Michael K  I get it  He was late to go to live  For the Suede interview  I got it  But the problem was  He was late on our show  So people have to wait  All the way down the line  Right  Yeah  Because we barely had  A half hour with him  He was really late  No no no  It was a little later than that  Yeah  But they wouldn't do that  They wouldn't do that 
[03:29:00]  To other shows  They wouldn't dare  Fucking walk into other studios  And do that  They wouldn't dare  They do walk into other shows  In the Howard show  They walk into that show  And pull people out  We're not saying Howard  Don't walk into here  I'm saying  I'm not saying  We're going to have  The same studio as Howard  But I don't want them  Feeling comfortable  To walk in here  And just pull people  You had to go  So that's what  Then they can wave  Through the thing  And he can know  Or they can text him  But I don't want people  Just walking in  They don't have the right  To do that  We were aware  That he had to go  Yeah we knew that  We knew he had to go  I apologize  I'm sorry  And I think over the 
[03:29:30]  Course of the years  We've all realized  That even when we know  That guests have to leave  It's very hard  To do that hard  Alright you gotta go  Let's leave  Like cause we're usually  In the middle of something  I gotta go interview  Sebastian  Sorry guys  But believe me  When we know  A guest has to go  We're trying our best  To tail it off  We gave you  A five to ten minutes  Heads up  They should be  Comfortable enough  To walk in here  They should know  That they're not permitted  To walk in here  I cannot wait  To actually get in my  Vehicle  Right  And listen to 
[03:30:00]  The shit show  And listen to  Sam  Pump more poison  Into this conversation  Oh yeah  You will  I'm gonna say  His uncle  Cause that's what  Sam does by the way  He takes a situation  Where there might be  A little spark  Right  And he pours  Aviation fuel  On top of it  It'll be a raging fire  By eleven o'clock  Oh yes  By eleven o'clock  And then Ronnie B  Comes in and saves  The whole fucking  Right for him  Ronnie B  Comes in and goes  What seems to be  The problem there  He's a guest 
[03:30:30]  This is it  It's a no one situation  I can't talk  Jets New York Jets  Jets  Alright Roland  Good job today  Absolutely  Michael K. Williams  Great  I know  And Sebastian  Was fucking amazing  We had a great time  Yeah  Very cool  Can we go now  Oh boy  Here's the troublemaker  Now  Here's the incendiary device  How am I gonna make  This a raging fire  What is it now  Now it's nothing 
[03:31:00]  How are you gonna  Handle this Sam  Here's what happens  You could grab Sam  Literally pull his head  Like a grenade pin  And throw him into the room  Cause that's exactly  What you are  What just happened  Nothing  There was a tiff  There was no tiff  A tiff  That could probably  Be settled  With a little  Separated time  Jimmy's got something  To do over at Boneyard  He's doing an interview  Roland will be  Walking around  Perhaps windexing  His desk  I hear he does  Occasionally  Well when there's guests  And doing things like that  But you  On the other hand 
[03:31:30]  My friend  Will stoke  Stoke the flames  Of hatred  Sam  Stoke the flames  Of hatred  I'm not saying  Don't do it  Believe me  That probably  And you could use  This as a promo  Probably my favorite  Part of the shit show  Okay  Okay  Well now I have that  That's fine then  Very good  What happened  I can't wait  Alright can we go now  Actually we should have  Been go'd  16 minutes ago  But Michael K.

[03:35:30]  The drama that happened  At the end of today's show  What would they say  If that happened  If the after show  Didn't even bring up  What happened between  Roland and Jim today  I don't know  You know I'm not  A one trick pony  You know that  Don't you Sal  Yes sir  I'm a very  Multi-dimensional person  Has that other intern  Gotten permission  You could say it on  You could tell him  What to get on the air  Get the box  This is about 
[03:36:00]  What box  Why would you just  Grab a mic  And talk into it  To say what box  Like you're talking  To Sal  That was the least  Organic thing  Eric  I thought we were  Going to take some  Control over your intern  There's only so much  I can do  If I'm not near him  Did you hear him  Ask the microphone  What box  Yeah I don't know  What's going on  Who kid's outside  What's he doing  Is he coming in here  He's not doing your show  He's probably got some  Interviews to do right now  Matt  Do you need headphones on  To clean up the studio 
[03:36:30]  Matt  Eric  I thought we were  Going to control these people  This way I can listen  To the show  I'm talking  You're in the room  With me  Please clean up the studio  You can listen to the show  Outside later  Who kid  What's up man  What are you doing here  Who kid  Everything is very chaotic  Today  There's lots of people  In the hallways  The interns are cleaning up  The studios  Oh for real  Well you see the interns  Cleaning up the studios  I thought I got fired  I saw Stephen Blatter in here  No  Steve Blatter comes up to us 
[03:37:00]  And he says  You know  How are you doing  How was the show  Yeah  He likes our show  I know with you guys  He's kind of like  Okay I set the whole thing up  Yeah  Now just go  He's like  You guys smoke a weed in here  No I don't know  What that smell is  There are pungent odors  Coming from that studio  Snoop Dogg  You're like  Stephen Blatter  Don't know who Snoop Dogg is  Come on man  You told us we could have him in  What do you expect to happen  I came here to pick up  Chocolate Me  What's Chocolate Me  What is Chocolate Me  It's a new kid book  By Taye Diggs  I thought I'd pick it up 
[03:37:30]  And give it to my mixed race son  Oh you have a mixed race son  Yeah  What's the other  Is it Sam Roberts  Is that  Is it me  You man  You're the one who's  Bilal  Not me  Oh  No  No  Chocolate Me  I think it's for about  I think it's about  It's a  I don't know  A kid book for black kids  Or something  Taye Diggs is writing  Kids books  Can a white kid get this book  Chocolate Me  I don't know  I think a white kid  Would be perceived as racist  Bringing that to the cash register  I always wondered  Maybe he could get Vanilla Me  Plus I mean  And that's a bad example 
[03:38:00]  Because little kids  Are going to be pointing  At little black kids  And calling them Chocolate  I don't know  I can't wait to see him  This weekend  And ask him  He's going to be up  On the Hollywood Shuffle  What's this weekend  Because the thing about  Who Kid is  You got to  It's DJ Who Kid  On Twitter right  Yeah  At DJ Who Kid  Of course  Even whether you listen  Or not  Just follow him  For the ridiculousness  Of it  Because  Every weekend  It's a different weekend  Like I woke up  Two weekends ago  And apparently  It was National Body Odor Weekend  And what is it this weekend 
[03:38:30]  It's a pubic service announcement  It's like  It's for like pubic hair  Like you know  Situations  Like you know  Like I don't know  Pubic hair is an epidemic  Right  And so what he does is  He does his show  Who Kid's show  Is the strangest thing in the world  Because he does his show  And his show is nine hours long  Yeah it's like nine hours  And who I had last week  I had Kendra Wilkinson  Talking about  Right but like  You bring up  Moisture and stuff like that  You bring up celebrities  You'll interview them  And then in between  You're talking to the people at home 
[03:39:00]  About pubic hair  Or body odor  Or whatever it is  It can't get any better than that  Do these celebrities  Know what they're in for  When they come in  No most of the time  They don't  And but they just love the fact  That they could wall out  And curse  And just be themselves  And you know  They always like express  How gay they are  They're gay  Like most  They say everybody  On this planet is gay  So  Who says that  The stars  When they come on my show  So you're saying  Like you're gay  I'm not gay  Like you just said  Everybody on the planet  In our DNA 
[03:39:30]  We're all originally gay  And what happened to us  The alien came  And spliced us  Where are you getting  This information from  This is a kind of ridiculous  I was smoking some good shit  This morning  Okay that's what that smell is  I thought it started  Seeping into the studio  Chocolate tea  I'm drinking  Chocolate tea  Chocolate tea  You know Michael K. Williams  Is up here  Oh is he  You watch The Wire  Boardwalk Empire  He kicks the guy  Yeah he's from Brooklyn  He actually did a gay role  In The Wire  Where he was tonguing everybody  Yeah you're very into  Gay culture today  Is it national  I told you everybody 
[03:40:00]  Was naturally gay  In the beginning  Yeah he was  He was a gay gangster  Homothug  That's what they call him  All right God is gay too  But I don't know  You don't know for sure  I don't know  I was at the Vatican  Like a couple weeks ago  Everybody was hoping  Each other  I don't know  You do travel  You do travel  We had Michael K. Williams  His mom on the phone  On this show today  Yeah  She called up  Because she was calling  She was calling him  On his cell phone  While he was in studio  And she called him twice  And he picked up his phone  He said it's Big Mama  And they said  Opie and Anthony  Were like who's Big Mama  And he said  That's my mom 
[03:40:30]  And so Opie was like  We should call her on the air  And Michael K. Williams  Like yeah we should call her  On the air  And y'all really called her  And so yeah  We took her number down  And called her  And she's a  Straight Caribbean woman  I think she's bohemian  Oh for real  From the island  She's still got that accent  She said she never  Watched him on the wire  Because she doesn't  Like that stuff  Oh the tonguing  And kissing gangsters  It's not all about  The gay stuff  I meant the violence  And stuff like that  Why do you have to  Bring it back to the  Tonguing and the kissing  And the moisture  Because you know 
[03:41:00]  We're so used to violence  You know I roll with  Like G-Unit  We see shootings  All the time  That's normal  But we just don't see  Gangsters tonguing  You don't see that  In G-Unit  Tell me  Who in G-Unit  Because G-Unit  Is a big enough crew  That there's got to be one  Who has had the most  Gay experience  In G-Unit  Maybe Coach PR  Coach I've heard him  On this show  I've met him  Because you always say  Matter of fact  Let me get out of that  Coach PR  Possibly  It's a possibility  Nah I'm joking 
[03:41:30]  But I don't know  I mean I wouldn't know  Because everybody's  So secretive now  You can't tell  I get no more  No more rats  I was with LeBron James  The other day  At a party  And you know  He was having a ball  Doing gay stuff  Nah he wasn't  Doing no gay stuff  Not LeBron  Nah definitely not LeBron  You think LeBron's bummed out  That he didn't go to the Nets  Now that they're coming to Brooklyn  Yeah that's crazy  Jay-Z is bringing the Nets  I think Jay-Z  Is more bummed out  Because that's like his boy  Yeah  I think Jay-Z's bummed out  About that Camo video  You made of him  On his website  That's what I think 
[03:42:00]  Jay-Z's bummed out about  Jay-Z  You know  I'm scared to talk about him  Because you know  He's been  I don't know  People have been missing lately  That's been making it funny  Yeah  He's a powerful guy  Yeah that's why I told  You know him and Lil Wayne  Are battling each other  Yeah  Well especially now  That he's going to be a father  Like  I don't think he's going to  Want to fuck around  With anyone  But they actually  Stopped Jay-Z  Because he was supposed  To do a speech  With Bloomberg  But he had on the jeggings  Because he was trying  To go at Lil Wayne  So he assumed  That maybe he could wear jeggings 
[03:42:30]  Too  But Bloomberg was like  Yo  I'll do that kind of stuff  He's wearing the tight  Lil Wayne jeggings  Those are  Lil Wayne  For those that don't know  Because  He's in the Shade 45 audience  I know  Who kid  But jeggings  Are what Lil Wayne  Has started performing in  I think the white world knows  Because he wore them on MTV  Right  They're the tight tight  Like  Leggings  Jeans  And Lil Wayne  Though sometimes wears them  In animal prints  Right  He's assuming he's a rock star  Because I got Guns N' Roses  Coming on my show  In two weeks  So  What 
[03:43:00]  I will be asking them  About their reaction  To Lil Wayne  Guns N' Roses  Is going to be up  They're going to be up here  Wilding out on  Axl too  Axl and  What's his name  Duff  Duff is going to be here  Duff's going to be here too  Axl and Duff  I don't know if they get along  No they finally  They're going to  Tongue on my show  You're going to get them  Tongueing  So there's a lot of  Gay stuff going on  In white rock and roll  But not hip hop  Is that what you're saying  Definitely  Oh okay  They're just trying to be safe now  But back to  Lil Wayne's Karate Kicks  And  What do you think of  Lil Wayne  I was reading on 
[03:43:30]  TMZ and stuff  He's a skateboarder now  Like he's putting out  Skateboarding videos  He's busting his head  Yeah Lil Wayne  Like for  Like he's supposed to be  Like the best rapper alive  Whatever  He's trying to be a little white kid  But then he comes out  With these skateboarding videos  And he's like a little kid  Kind of learning  How to skateboard  It's just the reverse  You know the white kids  Want to be black  Right  In hip hop  But the rappers  Want to be white kids  Yeah okay  Okay that's the new  It's the new reversal now  So the rappers want to be  The white kids  And the white kids  Want to be the rappers  So  I just want to  I want to point out  For the record  That I get 
[03:44:00]  A lot of  Controversy surrounding me  Because people think  That I like to start  Fights with people  And when I see  A fight happening  That I want to  I want to make sure  That it blows up  As big as possible  There was a fight in here  I see a white boy  Crying on the corner  Who's that  Crying over there  He's not allowed to talk  That's intern Matt  He blew it yesterday  He's not allowed to talk  He's not  He's not doing well  He's so red  It's his third day here  He's not  He's not doing well  He's crying over there  Yeah he's actually  A poor example 
[03:44:30]  Of the white race  While you're in here  Chocolate me  Yeah exactly  But  Norton  Absurd right here  Chocolate me  A kid's book by  Norton and Roland  Got into a fight  Not a fight  At TIFF  Okay  A little bit at the end  Of the show today  And you know  Opie and Anthony  Are all like  Oh wait till Sam  Comes in here  And starts stirring up shit  I just wanted to  Make the record clear  I'm a very diverse  Person  Okay  I don't always need  To go in that direction 
[03:45:00]  Okay  Yeah exactly  You thought I was  Going to knock you out  Now I'm putting  Someone in chokehold  You know  Speaking of  Guns and Roses  They got  We were talking  About it on O&A today  They got  They're  In the nominations  They're not officially in  But they may be  Going into the  Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  This year  I'm surprised  They've never been  In the Rock  They're not in  That don't make no sense  You know  Eric B and Rakim  They're in the  They're about to  They're on the ballot  This year  Are they  Yeah  In the Rock and Roll 
[03:45:30]  Hall of Fame  Friend DMC is on there  Right  They're in already  Yeah  Yeah  But people are upset  Cause like Rush  And Kiss  And all these  Like white bands  They're not in  I can't understand that  But Run DMC  And Eric B and Rakim  But Guns and Roses  Unbelievable  That they're not in  They're  They're probably  I would think  That they'll get it  And they're gonna be in  This year  They're actually  Gonna be in concert  Here in the  On the east coast  It's not official though  No  It's official  Oh it is official  They're playing 
[03:46:00]  In the  Eyeside Center  In East Rutherford  But it's not a real  Like Guns and Roses tour  They're just coming together  Doing a couple dates  Right  I don't know  Yeah  I don't think it's a  Giant tour  Cause it's a special thing  Guns and Roses  Doesn't  Doesn't  Tour too often  I can't believe  Paradise City  Did not make it  Into the Hall of Fame  I think God was singing that song  Even black people  Know Paradise City  This is what I'm saying  Are you fucking kidding me  But here's the big deal  That uh  How dare you white people  You know it's tough  To get tickets  To see Guns and Roses 
[03:46:30]  Especially for white people  Is it  Yeah  I mean  I got like eight  Cause he's coming to the interview  Yeah but that's also  Because you know 50 Cent  If you didn't know 50 Cent  Yeah if I didn't know him  Yeah you're right  They wouldn't be hooking you up  I know him and them too  And Dr. Dre  Exactly  You know a lot of  And LeBron you're partying with  You got the hook up  But I  What people don't realize  I'm prepared  To give the audience  The hook up  Oh for real  How you doing  Cause if you can get to New Jersey  Let me see  Uh  The concert's on  November 17th 
[03:47:00]  Okay  The tickets  The tickets don't go on sale  Until October 1st  Not until Saturday  But people don't like to sit  In line at the box office  They don't like to go to  Ticketmaster  And try to get their tickets  Of course  So what if I just gave away  A pair of tickets right now  For free  What if I just did it  How about this  866  Wow1Wow  866  969  1  9  6  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9 
[03:47:30]  10  Guns N' Roses  Live in concert  You sure you want to do that though  I could get 2,500 for each ticket  Well, maybe you should be calling it.  Look at the kind of influence I have.  Look at those phones.  Let me get the warm line real quick.  Okay.  Sam, can you tell the hotline?  I'm going to go to this call. 
[03:48:00]  Hello, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Calling for the GNR tickets.  What's your name?  You're on the air, by the way.  What's your name?  Matt.  Matt, where are you from?  New York.  Matt, are you a big GNR fan?  Yeah, pretty decent.  Pretty decent?  What's your favorite song?  Hang up on you.  Gotta go what?  I'm thinking, I'm thinking.  Oh, Matt, don't make me hang up on you.  No, don't do that, Sam.  What's your favorite song?  Paradise City.  Paradise City.  You just heard Who Kid say that. 
[03:48:30]  That's right, you said that.  But listen.  I don't think he's a real fan, yo.  Matt.  I don't know, man.  Who Kid?  Are you going to take it away from him?  Nah, I want no white boy.  You don't want white person problems.  Matt, you just won.  Congratulations, Matt.  Matt, you just won a pair of tickets to see GNR.  You got to get out of here, Who Kid?  You got to do an interview?  Are you going to give him vanilla ice sperm, too?  No, no vanilla ice sperm, man.  Get out of here.  Thank you, Who Kid.  Chocolate meat.  Go interview Tate Diggs about chocolate meat, whatever you're here to do. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you for stopping by the after show.  Matt, I'm going to put you on hold.  So stay on hold, and Sal, the intern, is going to take down your information.  Congratulations, Matt.  Thanks, Sam.  All right, hold on.  And there you have it.  He's won a pair of tickets to see Guns N' Roses November 17th at the IZOT Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  For the rest of you, tickets go on sale this Saturday, October 1st.  I'm assuming Matt's 18 years old and a listener or subscriber. 
[03:49:30]  I mean, how else would he have heard me say that?  And if you're from Canada, we cannot accept you.  But guess what?  Dave's going to be so mad at you.  I know Dave's going to be mad, but I have good news for Eastside Dave and for everybody else who called up,  because we filled up the phone lines in five seconds.  We have Axl coming in?  Well, you can work on that for me.  Okay.  A lot of people want these Guns N' Roses tickets, and a lot of people listen to After Open Anthony Live.  So what I am going to do is I'm going to give another pair of tickets away tomorrow.  Tomorrow we give away another pair of tickets to see Guns N' Roses on November 17th. 
[03:50:00]  So if you're on the East Coast or can get to the East Coast on November 17th, be listening tomorrow,  because I'm going to give away another pair of Guns N' Roses tickets.  Dave's still going to be mad at you.  Well, he can call in and try to win them, can't he?  He can't.  Oh.  Well, then I guess he's going to have to wait until October 1st when they go on sale.  Oh, poor Dave.  Roland.  Hello.  How's everything?  Oh, fantastic.  I'm not fanning the flames.  They said I would do it. 
[03:50:30]  I'm not doing it.  You doing okay, buddy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's a little tiff at the end of the show.  That's the only thing.  There was?  There was.  Jim was mad that you poked him.  But I don't want to talk about it, but he was upset.  I apologize.  I'll never touch him again.  You seem like a broken man.  My happy place has been raped, pillaged, and burnt.  Oh, my God.  In my mind.  Oh, no.  You needed that place.  It's done.  It's burned.  It's all you had left.  All I have right now is Sebastian in the Box basement swimming pool. 
[03:51:00]  That's my happy place.  So Hurricane Irene just came in and left your happy place a condemned mess.  It fucked me in the ass, slapped me in the fuck in my mouth, and then turned me over again.  Well, Roland, at least we still have each other, I guess.  Yeah.  You're around there.  My happy place.  I was.  I'm not going to stay there anymore.  It's condemned.  Yeah.  It's not good.  No.  Well, I mean, is Michael Hayes Williams still here? 
[03:51:30]  He's doing another interview.  Yeah, he's here for another hour.  Can I get a picture with him later?  Yeah.  If it's okay.  I don't want to.  I know your happy place is gone.  I'm afraid to ask Roland for anything right now because he's in a very fragile state.  And his happy place, as he said, has been raped, pillaged, burned to the ground, and taken over by Hurricane Irene, much like Sebastian Bach's house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's about accurate.  That's a shame, Roland. 
[03:52:00]  I say back up for him.  I got a dick it is.  You got a dick it is.  To sum it all up, Roland.  You got a dick in the ass.  I did, I did.  Story of your life.  I can't wait until Roland's autobiography comes out and he calls it dick in the ass.  Now, Roland.  It'll be called, finally, my turn, dick in your ass.  It'll be a tell-all.  Roland, I don't know if you were on Twitter last night, but Anthony and me were warring over our internet t-shirts that we're doing on Twitter. 
[03:52:30]  When will the dick in the ass t-shirt become available?  Because that's one that I think, because not only does it relate to you, but I feel like a lot of people out there, and this is why I talked to you about this, a lot of people listening can relate to getting the proverbial dick in the ass.  Now, this is not a, again, Who Kid was in here talking about a lot of gay kissing and sex.  We don't literally mean a dick in the ass.  What we mean is, of course, so to speak. 
[03:53:00]  When are the dick in the ass t-shirts going to come out?  Because everybody out there has gotten a dick in the ass from their boss.  Or they call them boss holes.  Boss holes.  That could be the name of the clothing line.  No, that's when my friend has a boss.  They all hate him so much, they just nicknamed him boss hole.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a clever nickname.  But are you working on those shirts?  Yeah, I'm going to work on those shirts.  Yeah?  I'll have the little balls smile and go, dick in the ass. 
[03:53:30]  I think it's a good idea.  I'm glad that you brought up Sebastian Bach, though.  Because, I mean, I can't imagine.  Because, like, I guess Jim related to him, because he's a collector.  I'm a collector of things, too.  I know Eric is, too.  Danny is a collector of posters and stuff.  Like, for me, it's all wrestling stuff.  And I guess I'm in a third floor apartment.  And I don't have that much stuff in it.  So it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  I mean, I'd be bummed out. 
[03:54:00]  But, I mean, my parents' house is where everything, all the wrestling stuff that I've compiled,  all the worthless wrestling junk that I've put together since I was an infant,  is just sitting in closets collecting dust in my parents' house.  But it means the world to me.  And I can't imagine the trauma that I would go through if what happened to Sebastian Bach.  All those years collecting dick in the ass.  And that's what it would seem like, a dick in the ass.  It's like, all these years meant nothing. 
[03:54:30]  Like, I think it's a sickness.  The hours of finding the figure in Toys R Us.  You go to seven of them.  I think it's a sickness because it's like, I know what a big, like, let's say wrestling.  And this applies to whatever you are a collector of.  Like, I know what a big fan I am of this.  And so, but if I don't have all the stuff and the things and the junk that I've accumulated  relating to it, I don't have anything that verifies what a fan I am. 
[03:55:00]  Like, I don't have enough inside me.  I'm that shallow and empty of a person that I can't just know that I'm a big fan.  I need to have all the stuff around me.  So, and, you know, that's not a criticism on anybody because there's lots of collectors.  But Sebastian Bach, like, not only did he have all his cool Kiss stuff and, like, all  the things that he was a fan of and, like, as a fan of that music getting into that world.  Imagine Autograph Morabillia, too.  Yeah, he got to have all this stuff that nobody gets to have because fans don't get to enter 
[03:55:30]  the world like he did.  And then, on top of that, he had all this Skid Row stuff, all the stuff that's his career.  And it's the same way, the way, like, you need these things to make your obsession mean  something.  Like, he may, I would, I collect everything I do on radio, which hasn't been much, quite  frankly.  But I collect everything and it's like I need that to make it seem like what I'm doing is 
[03:56:00]  worthwhile.  It would be like if Eric lost his Hoagie No. 1 belt in a bad storm.  That doesn't even make any sense.  Good one.  Do you, you don't, you don't really collect stuff.  Yeah, he does.  I used to, yeah.  You do, what did you collect?  No, I just focus on posting.  I like, fuck all that.  Because it costs already enough dating New York, so it's like.  Yeah.  You're just trying to get your dick wet now?  Yeah, fuck it.  What did you use to collect?  No, I still collect, I collect baseball cards, hockey cards, and.  Oh, really?  You're a card guy? 
[03:56:30]  I never knew that.  Yeah, I have, at my parents' house, I probably have 70 boxes.  Of cards?  Yeah, like those.  Wow.  Binders and stuff.  Yeah.  Wow.  So what would happen, and this is paper goods, so water hits it and it's dead.  I would cry.  Yeah.  I mean, Eric.  I have Jordan rookie cards, I have all of them.  Really?  Yeah.  But you're never going to sell them.  Did you preserve these?  I think my mom sold two.  He does not have a problem.  Because I'd ask my mom, I'd go, how's my cards?  She goes, they're very nice.  Your father and I are enjoying them. 
[03:57:00]  I'm like.  Oh my God.  Man, if my mother ever sold my things, I'd disown them.  Like as good as my parents have been to me, and you've heard them on this show before,  I would emancipate myself from them at the age of 28 if they did that.  I sort of thought it was funny though.  I'd go, that's pretty smart.  I would have done the same thing.  You would have sold your kids' cards.  But Eric, I've seen your plays.  Yeah.  And you've got, you're a big time collector.  Of meats, cheeses. 
[03:57:30]  That's a good one.  Yeah, keep dying inside, fat boy.  Oh, he said keep dying inside, fat boy.  I am.  There's Liam.  It seems like the whole talent department is walking around on their tiptoes right now.  Eric, your walls are covered in memorabilia.  Yeah.  And it's all like, your collection is the celebrities that you've gotten to meet because  of your career.  And you get, I mean.  Not all of it, but most of it, yes.  That's your big thing, I think. 
[03:58:00]  I mean, you got your Simpsons stuff, you got your wrestling stuff, you got your DVDs.  But I think what really matters to you is the autographs and the pictures, right?  Like if you had to pick one collection.  Simpsons stuff.  Really?  Yes, over everything.  But what if you had to give up the Simpsons autograph stuff?  Why would I have to?  Because those count as pictures and autographs.  You can only pick one collection.  So the Simpsons stuff.  No, whatever.  No, fuck that.  No, really.  But.  Simpsons over the wrestling stuff. 
[03:58:30]  I.  Your walls are covered.  Yeah.  With celebrity stuff.  Yeah.  With celebrity stuff.  Charging glass all over.  It's not Simpsons stuff all over your house.  In the one room it is.  No, in one room, but in every room.  No, not in every room.  You have celebrity stuff.  I can't go, I can't look in your house without seeing.  That hallway that you've seen has stuff.  And you've got little framed pictures running around everywhere.  A little, another one pops up here, another one pops up there.  And you've got piles and piles of shit that you've had signed here. 
[03:59:00]  There's a cabinet for that.  I mean, I honestly, I think that you're just, out of sheer volume, your collection of things  that you've accumulated while working on a show where you get to interact with celebrities.  And all over his house there's pictures of him and this chick all over the place.  That's my wife.  Oh.  Oh.  You know what sucks, though, about when Sebastian was talking about everything that he lost  with the flood?  When he was saying he had all those old VHS tapes and Super A film. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  The shit that was on it from tour buses, backstage, festivals.  And it's just gone forever.  Private planes, you know.  And it's just gone forever.  I would have killed to have seen that.  What would you do?  If something happened and your whole, you know, say your picture collection got wiped  out and your hard drives did, too, so you lost all your celebrity pictures and autographs.  Well, at that point, like, if you lost that stuff, I mean, it kind of, it would kill you 
[04:00:00]  inside.  Yeah.  But in a, in just in a horrible way, it's kind of freeing because you're like, there's  no way I could even attempt.  Would you restart?  To recreate?  No, I couldn't.  You wouldn't.  Because there was too much involved, uh, putting in, uh, too much time and effort and  whatever, putting in to collecting these things.  But by, at that point, if it was all gone, you'd just be like, well, all I can do is  remember it now because I, I can't.  It's everything to you, though.  You get pictures of people you don't even know who they are.  I mean, that's your whole, like, thing. 
[04:00:30]  I feel like what would happen is everything would get washed away, right?  And then, um, you would stop.  But then somebody would come in that you actually really did care about and you'd be like,  I guess I should get a picture with them.  I guess I could get something signed and then the whole cycle would start up again.  Like, for me, I'm pretty sure I would try to replace every single piece of wrestling  memorabilia I lost and then some.  Now, you've, you've said in the past that at your parents' house, there's closets full  of wrestling stuff.  I mean, I told Opie, like, the next Opie and Anthony Cribs, like we talked about on the 
[04:01:00]  show today with Sebastian Bach, when we did Jim Cribs and his old place that he shared  with Florentine.  It should be down at my parents' house.  Because, I mean, I'm telling you, the things that are in this house are ridiculous.  Well, you have all the stuff in closets and stuff and you said you've been collecting  it forever.  Well, two-part question.  One, do you ever go through it still and go, you know what, I don't really need this  and kind of weed shit out?  No, no, no.  You keep everything.  I keep everything.  And every time I go to my parents' house, which is probably once a week or so, because 
[04:01:30]  they live, like, 15 minutes away from me.  So I go over there and I frequently, and this is not a joke, I frequently go to the  closets and just open the doors and look at what's in there and that gives me a feeling  of fulfillment and then I close the closets again.  You never pull anything out and go, yeah, I used to, I know I have this, but you know  what, I don't really need this.  So I'm going to get rid of that and sell it and keep this stuff.  No.  Never.  Never.  You know what I have in the closet, in the bedroom that I used to sleep in? 
[04:02:00]  A foam rubber Undertaker urn from 1992.  I have everything.  Yes.  It's a foam, it's made of foam rubber and it's an Undertaker urn and it says R.I.P.  on it and it's made of the cheapest material ever.  It should have been destroyed.  It should have been chewed up by a dog, but it's sitting there in the closet.  So you're going to keep everything.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to make a lot of money.  I'm going to have to figure out something other than radio, Eric, because this is not  panning out so far.  Jeez.  I mean, I'm going to need a place. 
[04:02:30]  Because I've gone back through collections that I've had of stuff and I'll look through  and I'll go, yeah, I really don't need this piece.  I'll get rid of that.  Never.  To make room for some other things.  Eric has a Burger King crown.  Yeah, Eric, he gets a little crown every time he goes to Burger King and he lines them  up.  He actually has a closet and it's full of just Burger King crowns because he lines them up and he  remembers, oh, I remember that was a double Whopper with cheese and a chicken sandwich  on the side with fries and onion rings.  I remember that day.  You know?  And then he goes, oh, that was yesterday. 
[04:03:00]  Right.  That was yesterday when he came back here with his Burger King crown on.  Oh, that one.  I remember we celebrated my birthday that day.  Oh, I remember that day I had two milkshakes.  Oh, you know what I mean?  And he goes crown by crown remembering the great memories of each individual Burger King  trip.  At first, he was dating the crowns like on the inside where it's white.  He would write the date so he remembered.  But now it's gotten to the point where actually based on appearance, whether it's, you know,  a crease on the crown or a small tear or something, he remembers just by sight what day the trip 
[04:03:30]  to Burger King was.  And he's taken so many.  I mean, that's commendable.  Keep going.  You got four more minutes to go.  I'm just saying.  We're talking about collections.  Long way to go with that.  But all right.  I've been to your house.  He looks angry.  Well, I'm not angry.  He didn't want me bringing up his Burger King crown collection on the air.  It's fine.  It is what it is.  You never once thought to go through all that stuff that you have and say, you know, there's  some stuff here that I have.  I don't really need that.  I'll get rid of that.  I got to a point at one point in my collecting where I was, and this was when, even when 
[04:04:00]  I was a teenager, where I was opening figures and then saving the boxes that they came in  instead of throwing them out and putting them in giant garbage bags.  You're doing what with them?  Putting them in, and putting them in the attic.  Just the empty.  Yes.  I just got to the point where I told my.  The plastic and the card.  Yes.  Like a figure.  And you just would keep that stacked in the attic.  Yes.  That's a fire hazard.  I told my, I just got to the point like a couple years ago where I told my mom it was okay  to throw out some of the boxes.  Some.  Not all.  Not all.  But these are empty boxes. 
[04:04:30]  They're garbage.  They're the things you throw out after you open your toy.  Sam, you're sick.  It's very strange.  I'm telling you, Eric.  This has to get done.  I did want to say one thing before we have to go, though.  Jocktober.  Yes.  Is happening.  Well, that Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Yeah.  Mars came in saying, oh, Raw Dog is copying you.  Yeah.  Twitter's been doing that, too.  It's not.  Did you hear the promos running on your channel?  It's on Mars' new glasses.  So you see what he's really not doing.  Oh, my God.  It's a different.  Jocktober has nothing to do with Jocktober.  It just both has a J and an O in them. 
[04:05:00]  So how do people submit suggestions for Jocktober?  Because people have been asking me that.  Yeah.  And I've been directing them to your Twitter.  This is the most hotly anticipated Jocktober of all time.  It starts next Monday.  Yeah.  It starts on Monday.  And I've been getting tons of questions about it.  So I'm going to open up.  I'm going to start probably right after this.  I'm going to go back to the office.  I'm going to, on my Facebook, which is Facebook slash Primetime Sam Roberts.  One word, I think.  Like, I'll say, what are your Jocktober suggestions?  And just list the stations. 
[04:05:30]  I can find.  Or the shows or whatever.  Danny Bonaduce.  Just tell.  Links help, too, if you want to give them links.  Yeah, but I can Google, too.  And Danny Bonaduce doesn't count because he doesn't have a radio show.  So let me know what you want to hear for Jocktober.  Because I want to visit all kinds of towns.  I've been looking at stations already.  I hear you.  But let's make it official.  Some of the old go-tos are going to be back.  They'll be back.  Scott and Todd, you will not get off the hook.  You never will.  Facebook.com slash Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[04:06:00]  And I'll open up a thing so we can keep everything together.  And I can use that as a reference point.  And I'll tweet it out, too, for those that didn't hear this.  But if you didn't hear this, the Twitter plug will mean nothing.  This has been After Open Anthony Live.  Congratulations to Matt in New York for winning the Guns N' Roses tickets.  We'll have another one to give away tomorrow.  Too bad I'm going to Radiohead, Matt.  Well, he's going to GNR.  Whatever.  Why make fun of him?  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll be back tomorrow. 
[04:06:30]  Open Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  And catch O.P. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus.  On the virus. </pre>
