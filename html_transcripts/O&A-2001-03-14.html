<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with typical nonsensical chatter before launching into “Whip-em-Out Wednesday,” a listener segment involving car stickers.  This transitioned into a discussion on proper listener etiquette when leaving messages, specifically emphasizing clear phone numbers. The hosts then reminisced about comedian Brian Regan, contrasting his clean stage persona with his hard-partying offstage life, sharing stories of late-night hangouts with him and former night show hosts Ron and Fez.

Workplace tensions at the radio station were next, with Opie vehemently complaining about his inconveniently placed headphone jack, leading to humorous arguments with the engineer, Pete. The conversation shifted to a recent comedy show review, praising Louis Black and Brewer while harshly criticizing Janine Garofalo’s performance and the heckler who confronted her.  Ben’s account of a backstage encounter with Garofalo was recounted, and the heckler even called in. Further discussion about the show and the comedians ensued, escalating into a vulgar argument between Opie and a caller, Janet, who accused him of whining.

Rich Vos joined the show for an interview, sharing stories from his comedy career and humorously speculating about his upcoming trip to Amsterdam’s red-light district.  Opie concluded this segment with an anecdote about his mother’s obsessive vacuuming and his brother’s comedic imitation of her.

The next segment featured numerous callers sharing often disturbing anecdotes about their mothers, including strong aversions to vacuum cleaners, alleged cocaine use, and unusual cleaning habits.  Stockbroker Dave, distraught over significant financial losses, detailed the impact on his personal life.  The hosts then promoted “Musical Dildo Chairs,” a game involving women, chairs, dildos, and a WrestleMania trip as the prize, elaborating on the rules and soliciting caller suggestions.  A call with Chuck Farnham followed, recounting a bizarre Vegas trip involving a dwarf engaging in numerous sex acts, and his creation of stuffed rabbits with taxidermied teeth.  The segment ended with further discussion of "Musical Dildo Chairs" and the upcoming appearance of a Survivor contestant.  A band and a self-proclaimed "Drudge Jr." also briefly called in.

A lengthy discussion about Patty, a long-time friend of staff member Reynolds, dominated the next segment.  Jokes about their 25-year relationship and Patty's supposed ongoing pursuit of Reynolds filled the air.  Patty, present in the studio, became the focus, with crude jokes about her rear end ("Bobo").  Encouraged by the hosts, she attempted a musical performance, accompanied by Steve, a struggling guitarist from the station.  The conversation veered toward Patty’s desire to enter a "best ass" contest, culminating in her removing her pants to showcase her buttocks for a photograph. This revealed scratches, leading to more vulgar commentary. Jim Norton called in adding to the offensive humor.  Jeff Varner from *Survivor: Australia* was interviewed, discussing the show, including rumors of a gay contestant.  A brief call from Lady Di also occurred.  Rich Voss and Dave from *The Real World: Los Angeles* were also studio guests during this segment. The segment concluded with further discussion of Patty's "Bobo," the contest, and "Musical Dildo Chairs."

The final segment showcased a hostile interaction with a cab driver, escalating into a challenge to a physical fight, filled with crude insults and ethnic slurs.  Lady Di called again, revealing she hadn't had sex in seven years, prompting unsolicited and crude advice from Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss. She was eventually persuaded to describe her body while undressed on air. A listener expressed anger over a previous interaction.  Henry Rollins and Frank Halliendo were announced as upcoming guests. Dave from *The Real World: Los Angeles* was again a studio guest.  Listener calls and a song about the hosts concluded the broadcast.

[00:01:30]  Isn't it, Anthony?  Yes, it is  Notice  We're starting to talk about Whip-em-Out Wednesday  A little bit more  As the weather gets nicer  It's getting a little warmer  That's when people start seeing the cans  It's staying light out  Right  Sun doesn't go down until after 5 o'clock now  Very nice  Basically, if you want in on Whip-em-Out Wednesday  Just walking around Manhattan  You see the WOW stickers all over the place  Yeah  You need to get 
[00:02:00]  A WOW sticker on your ride  It's very easy  Just send a self-addressed  Stance envelope  To WNEW  888 7th Avenue  New York, New York  10106  And we'll send that out to you  Right  It's a two-pronged thing  It gets WOW out there  It gets you to see some boobs  And it gives our interns something to do  They answer the letters  And stuff the envelopes with the WOW stickers  And between faking injuries and car accidents  Right  They get the WOW stickers out to the faithful listeners of this show 
[00:02:30]  Also, it's cool  A lot of people put the WOW sticker on their car just to support the show  We like that as well  Yeah, a lot of ladies put WOW stickers on their cars  And they have no intention of flashing their boobies  Right  It's just kind of a  Hey, I listened to O&A  It really stands out  You can see those things a mile away, man  Yeah, but don't delay  Get your self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail immediately  Because when we run out  It takes four or five weeks to get the new stickers  And you're going to lose out on all the fun 
[00:03:00]  That's going to happen very, very soon  Oh, yeah  I believe we're going to start up within three weeks  Have the big kickoff  The big kickoff party, you know  When it's a nice day  And it's Wednesday  And it's one of those real good spring days  Where you just know  That there's no more winter going to be edging in  By the way, if you need that address  It's on www.w.com  If you're in your car  Because I used to hate that  Someone would give an address  You listen to your favorite radio show  You're like, oh, I can't jot it down quick enough 
[00:03:30]  Try to jot it down on the back of like a McDonald's bag or something  I can't jot it down that fast  I don't know how to jot and drive at the same time  I was trying to jot  Because you jot those things down  You just jot them down  But, yeah, that's another thing  You know, while you're on that  You've got to tell people  If you're going to leave a message on an answering machine  Make the number clear  You ever listen to a message  Very important, this is life or death  Call me, it's 718-071-River-Suburban 
[00:04:00]  And 20 times you're trying to go through it  You give it to your  You've done this to me a few times  Anthony, could you try to figure this out?  And he gives me the phone  I'm like, no, it's 718-Lisbert  Right  But sometimes it's just one number  555-1618  All right, 73  What was that?  And how does that work?  Because then if you're checking messages  And you get a message from someone you care less about  They give the number five times  Five times  But the person you want to call back is always the one, like you just said, 973-273-288. 
[00:04:30]  So make that a little more clear.  There you have it.  Thank you.  Speaking of Brian Regan, who we do so, so good on this show.  Jot it down.  You've got to jot and drive.  How do you jot and drive?  I was jotting and trying to drive at the same time.  I can't do two things at one time.  The more you say that word jot, the more it just doesn't become a word anymore.  When you repeat a word too long.  Let's give that to Brian Regan.  Jot. 
[00:05:00]  I can picture him on stage doing a whole routine on jotting.  I'm just jotting.  I'm just jotting.  Drink, man.  Come on.  That's a good impression.  I did a good one, right?  Brian Regan coming back to town.  Yeah.  Maybe as soon as next week.  He's always good.  We're hearing things.  We don't know where he's playing.  We just know he's coming.  And I think it's next week.  And here's a guy who likes to party.  I mean, who knew?  Who knew?  We had him on our show.  Then he was playing Caroline's. 
[00:05:30]  We all go down to Caroline's.  Well, you got...  Okay.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  We see him do his show down there.  Which, yeah, the point I want to make, if you've never seen Brian Regan, one of the  funniest guys you'll ever see.  Doesn't curse.  No blue material.  Nothing.  Yeah.  As clean as it gets.  But when he's not on that stage or when he's off the radio, he's a sick ass.  Oh, yeah.  So then we all come back here.  He's not fooling anyone.  And this was when Ron and Fez were doing the night show.  We all came back here and hung out with Ron and Fez until three in the morning.  Just getting blasted, hammered. 
[00:06:00]  And Brian and his wife and everybody was in here just drinking.  I kind of miss Ron and Fez not being on after us, like at 11 o'clock.  Honestly, I think it's saving our show, though.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Those nights where I'm, like, going to bed at a nice hour and I'm setting my alarm clock  and I hear Ron, Fez, and Ant, I'm like, oh, no.  Those are great.  That means one thing.  Ant's going to be very hungover the next day. 
[00:06:30]  I don't care.  I can function.  No, I know you can.  I'm just trying to bust your ball.  It was that on the Friday nights.  All right.  You know, do it on a Friday night.  We should have Ron and Fez on live 11 to 3 on Friday nights so we can come back here and hang out.  You know, what we should do is just, you know, when we feel like it, we just come in and whatever's on the radio.  Off.  Because I really don't know what's on the radio, you know, late night.  What is?  We just come on, we turn off the big switch, and we go live.  We just go live and have a drunk fest.  We tell Ron and Fez, hey, tonight's the night.  We're just going to, you know, take over the station for a couple hours. 
[00:07:00]  We come in and just party and do an impromptu show.  It would make people listen to the late night programming here.  Because you never know when we're going to pop on all drunk.  You don't know when you're going to get the drunk guys.  The Afro show.  That'd rock.  Someone came up with the Afro show.  The Afro show.  Well, we're doing those, what are they called again, Anthony?  Those acronyms?  Yes.  Someone came up with Afro.  Anthony, Fez, Ron, and Opie.  Oh, there you go.  The Afro show. 
[00:07:30]  I miss the Afro show.  Good after the parties, too.  Those company parties where everyone hates each other and walks around with drinks like  we like each other.  And then afterwards, everyone comes back here and talks about everybody that you hate.  Now, see, the next station party we have, there will be no pretending.  It's what it is now.  How the hell are we going to do that?  The last one we had was Christmas party, right?  And that was right.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  There are people that walk around the halls now that I haven't talked to in months.  I know. 
[00:08:00]  See them every day.  It's a little uncomfortable.  You just make believe you don't see them as you're walking down that long hallway.  That's true.  God, is that the worst?  You start that long trek down a long hallway and there's the person coming the other way  and you're like, oh, I hate this person.  Oh, I can't deal with that.  You got to make believe you care, the fake nod.  Right.  You make believe you're looking at something on the floor.  All of a sudden you make believe, like, I don't know, you had an itch on your face  and you got to move your face real fast.  All that crap.  Think of all the fun stuff that came out of us coming on late. 
[00:08:30]  The whole, oh, do you think we care about your life?  Mmm.  You know, I don't think you'd have said that unless you were completely tanked.  I wasn't that drunk that night.  You had a good beer and a half, dude.  Yeah, like I need beer to say those stupid things.  Yeah, I know.  Come on.  Kind of miss it, though.  I know when Regan is coming.  All right.  These niggas are going to go fast.  Now that Brian Regan has made a bunch of appearances on our show, now when he comes to town, I mean, 
[00:09:00]  these shows sell out like crazy.  So when you find out and you really want to go, you got to call immediately.  Chris, what's up?  Caroline's, March 22nd to 25th.  That's when he'll be there.  That's next Friday.  Yeah.  Nice.  So put the word out and everybody get tickets now.  Can we confirm that?  It's in the Village Voice.  It is, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Call Caroline's if you want to see Brian Regan starting next weekend.  Cool.  Later, guys.  All right, man.  Bye.  There you have it.  Yeah.  We'll all be there.  Hey, man.  You know, I didn't make the comedy show last night.  I feel kind of bad. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I know.  I had some personal business I had to deal with.  Nothing major, but I just couldn't make it down there.  I heard we missed a great time.  I heard there was a ton of listeners there.  Well, it was out of control.  Ben said, Ben goes, guys, just, you know, just go on the radio and make believe you were  there, you know?  I was like, we can't.  We weren't there.  Yeah, it was a great time.  What?  You weren't?  I had a piss in there last night.  Ben's like, hey, man, I'll fill you in.  I'll tell you all the cool things that happened last night. 
[00:10:00]  And then I, thanks, Rick.  It's not my fault.  No, it's, you know what it is?  Hey, hey, hey, where's the engineer?  Where's Pete?  All right, Pete.  I'm not going to, look, just briefly, let me figure this problem, because it's been a  problem that's been here since we got here.  Yeah, we were flowing.  He's up on the roof.  Tell him to frigging jump.  We were flowing.  We had, like, a nice little flow going there.  Here's the problem.  Anyone that knows, anyone that's been in here as a guest knows this, because they have  taken my head off.  Every guest we've had that sits in this chair takes my mother effing head off, because 
[00:10:30]  you see where I sit?  This is where I sit, in front of the mic.  Where's the headphone jack for me?  Wait, you sit in front of the mic?  See?  I'm in front of the mic, right here in front of you.  I did not know that.  See where the headphone jack is?  It's way over there.  It is a good four feet away from me to my right.  So it's in front of the guest mic.  Right.  So now when the guest gets up.  There's Pete.  Or moves his chair in my graveyard.  You're going to yell at Pete.  He's been here for 30 years.  Pete.  He needs your craft.  Please, Pete. 
[00:11:00]  He's not even going to come over.  He's pissed at you.  Pete.  Can I ask you a simple question?  20 feet.  Simple question.  Pete, you didn't have to deal with this stuff when Scott Muni was in charge, right?  Well, Scott Muni had no problem.  He was sitting right where you were.  We had no problem.  I don't care.  He probably didn't use headphones.  He can't hear.  Pete.  Is there any reason?  Pete, Anthony has an attitude, doesn't he?  Yeah.  He wouldn't have fit in with the old crew here at N.E.W., would he?  Well, the first year he was here, he was a nice guy.  See?  It's the Opie influence.  I was just happy to be anywhere, I swear to God. 
[00:11:30]  You're a prick.  Pete, do you see a problem with my headphone jack?  Do you see a problem?  Just looking.  No.  No.  It's three, more than three feet away from me, where the guests sit.  Whenever they move their mic or move their legs, my head gets yanked away from the mic.  I usually cover it.  I usually don't say anything.  You never know.  That time, Rick moved the chair and I almost fell off my chair.  He almost ripped your ear right off.  Is this the first time that you registered a complaint about this? 
[00:12:00]  Do you believe this guy?  Let him have it, Pete.  There's a procedure we follow here.  This is not...  I don't know where you worked before.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  It's infinity.  It should take a good year to get this taken care of.  We have a protocol.  Okay.  Hey, can I ask you...  When you have to adjust your headphone volume, what do you have to do?  You see me.  Look, I go...  You can do that.  Look at me.  I just do this.  All right, look.  Look what I do.  I'll change my attitude.  Watch.  Watch how I do this.  Watch.  All right.  Pete, okay.  I apologize for jumping on you about this. 
[00:12:30]  And no, I haven't said anything in the past.  Okay.  So, is there a way we can get this jack over there put here so it's plugged in right near  me and no one pulls it out?  Well, when a guest sits there and goes to adjust their headphone volume because it's too  low, they crank mine up full because they think it's theirs and I blow my eardrum.  And they keep turning it up because they're not hearing anything in their headphones.  And I'm like, ah!  That's funny.  You know what I'm doing?  I'll move it on the other side so it'll be a bad idea about two feet close.  Pete, do you think Anthony is asking for too much? 
[00:13:00]  Pete, over here would be great.  If it was over here, I would love it.  This is boring for everyone.  It's just a little insight into what goes on here.  What's up, Pete?  Can you get it over here?  Yeah.  Thank you, Pete.  Well, I don't know when I can get to it.  Oh, when he can get to it.  Put it on your list of projects to do.  You want to put on about a 30-minute record or something?  I'll come in here.  A 30-minute record.  We don't do records anymore, Pete.  Records.  Put on the phonograph.  We're doing an entertaining talk show for the tri-state area. 
[00:13:30]  I guess you haven't noticed yet.  Put it on the...  He's laughing.  Put it on the Victrola.  Pete, when are you retiring?  You know you would have retired if we didn't come to NAW, right?  Forced retirement.  No, we gave him a couple of good years.  We gave him the new phone system put in and debug and everything.  Screw that.  We gave him lesbians.  That's why he's not hiring.  He was ready to go.  He's delayed his retirement because of our radio show.  Dude, he was ready to take Friday off until I told him what we were doing.  Pete, is it safe to assume... 
[00:14:00]  Is it safe to assume that tomorrow I'll be able to plug in to a Jack over here?  That's 24 hours to deal with it.  What else is pressing here at NAW that you would have to do something else?  If I come in when you're on the air, how's...  I mean, is it...  Well, no, no, no.  When I'm on the air, I think there is a good stretch of time that no one's on the air here.  Wait, can I jump in?  Opie, feel free.  Pete, can you please do it during our show?  Because I want to see him lose his ass.  No, I'll be fine. 
[00:14:30]  I don't think so.  You can do it during the show.  Doesn't even matter.  Remember in Boston when they would come in during our show with drills?  Oh, they got hammer drills in the floor, in the cement floor.  I swear to God.  Remember that?  We would try to be entertaining, and these guys would come in with their drills.  We'd do a break.  Opie, we got a hot girl.  We're going to put her on the blue tarp.  And they're really hot.  And they came in today to... 
[00:15:00]  Could you shut up?  We would lose our minds.  But it would sound just like that.  You engineers, you have no clue when good radio is going on.  Let's go to the phones.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I'll come in during the morning show.  There you go.  Do that.  Oh, is that a stab at our lovely morning show, Pete?  Sports guys.  Morning.  Are you jealous because you're not a sports guy?  No.  Oh, look at you.  All right, Pete.  Look at Pete with a little dig.  I'll see if it gets put on the list, okay? 
[00:15:30]  The list.  You know, this is never going to take care.  And you've got to get a P.O. approved.  Yeah, P.O.  Well, I asked for new lights in here.  Well, lights are one thing.  I could probably do this myself, but I'm sure there's some union things.  Explain it.  Oh, wow.  There are new light bulbs.  I take that back.  Look at that.  All right.  I'm going to take that back.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  He took care of my problem.  There is an invention that will extend the length of a headphone cord called a headphone jack extender.  Only four bucks at Radio Shack.  Vinny from Rosedale.  Tool, ass, C, F, douche. 
[00:16:00]  It's not the length of the cord.  You didn't explain yourself.  It's that the cord is plugged in so far away from me that it dips down, hits the floor,  gets under the wheels of the chairs.  The guests pull on it and adjust my volume because it's in front of their mic.  Yeah, Anthony's, yes, his volume is not in front of him where it should be.  Right.  It's at another microphone, so the guests assume that's their volume.  And Big Ken, shut up.  I'm not a diva.  He's a diva.  He goes, hey, diva, jack off, radio diva. 
[00:16:30]  Are you going to be, uh, WB-11 doing a story on you soon, Ant?  Well, there we go.  The complaint has been lodged.  You've seen it happen, though, right?  I've seen it happen so many times.  No, I've seen it happen so many times, it's frustrating because we'll be in the middle  of a break and Ant and I, on one of those rare occasions, we're flowing and next thing  you know, my head gets pulled and I usually don't say anything. 
[00:17:00]  I try to keep things going.  Or when the guest is turning up my volume, I have to lean over as they're talking and  it's pretty much reaching into their crotch area because that's where the jack is.  And they see me lunge over and start reaching.  They're like, hey, hey, hey.  Maybe Jimmy was on to something with those new promos yesterday.  I guess so.  That's right.  All right.  Where were we?  So we're talking about the comedy show that was at Town Hall last night.  Yeah.  Ben was there.  Ben said it was awesome.  Everyone was funny. 
[00:17:30]  Our listeners were out of control.  Almost everyone.  Almost everyone.  You want to tell the story?  That's how you've heard it five times.  You don't want to hear it anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, when I came in, I wanted to hear what happened last night at the comedy show.  And Ben starts telling me the story and Opie goes, oh, I've heard it five times  already.  Once from a drunken Ben calling me from the show.  Ben has a way of telling a story like over and over again when he's drunk.  It's a good story.  But it doesn't mean I don't enjoy the story.  My cell phone rang and I was like excited because I knew it was you with the story. 
[00:18:00]  I love when you call in the middle of the night with your stories.  So now you guys went.  Sneaky and I went.  Earl went.  Give us the overview of the story.  How did everyone that is a part of our show do?  They all killed, right?  Louis Black.  Unbelievable.  We missed Adam.  We have all new jokes and everything in here.  Who?  Louis Black?  Louis Black went crazy.  No, see, people should understand that.  Louis Black, when you go to see him, he's one of those comedians.  His act is always changing.  Topical.  Because he's always doing topical humor. 
[00:18:30]  Looks like he's going to have a heart attack.  It's topical.  I heard Brewer killed.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  Cool.  We missed Adam.  Adam did very well, though.  Adam did well.  Yes.  From what we heard, yeah.  And Janine Garofalo sucked.  She got heckled by one.  Hold on.  One.  I'm hearing by a lot.  Tracy, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Janine Garofalo.  Forget about it.  Guys, it was a benefit.  She comes out in, like, sweatpants, a big, like, sweatshirt, and, like, sunglasses on. 
[00:19:00]  That's her act.  Like, hey, you know.  He's got this piece of paper.  I was just walking by.  I figured I'd stroll in.  Well, some big fat guy from, like, up top in the balcony goes, like, you suck, you dyke.  And you could hear, like, a pin drop in everyone.  By the way, by the way, I would bet a lot of money that Janine Garofalo is listening right now.  If she had the balls I think she does have, call up the show.  She didn't seem to give a, like, a rat's crap.  Oh, yeah.  That's her whole gimmick.  Her whole gimmick.  And that's why we don't like her, because it's like, oh. 
[00:19:30]  I've never seen her before.  Your call is call up, and you're like, oh, she sucks, dude.  It's like, oh, I'm too cool.  I just woke up.  I haven't had time to shower.  And, oh, by the way, I hope you don't mind.  I'm working on new material.  You're not working on new material.  She's been doing that for how long?  We've been goofing about how long she's been doing it.  Did she have her little notepad on the little stool like we said she would have?  She had more of, like, a paper.  Oh, some paper.  She's not even a notepad anymore.  Now she's jotting it down on the way to the venue.  Yeah, like she's jotting down new jokes at the coffee shop.  Such a comedy genius that you jotted down.  Yeah, I'm going to try this one that I just wrote two hours ago. 
[00:20:00]  No, you wrote that years ago.  Who are you kidding?  And I heard, again, that, like, it wasn't one laugh out of her act.  Not at all.  Not one laugh.  I mean, what business do you have being on stage as a comedian?  If you're not going to comed.  She spent five minutes telling us how her new glasses aren't sunglasses.  So don't think of her as a cool comic that wears sunglasses.  They're just tinted.  But there was no joke at the end of it.  She just was telling people this. 
[00:20:30]  And everyone was like, okay.  Ben swears that Janine Garofalo backstage bumped into her a month ago.  Oh, yeah.  Well, here's the deal.  He's got it.  I'm thinking.  Ben, go through the whole thing of why that happened and the person next to you.  What happened was is we had gone up and seen Louis.  We had gone upstairs, watched Louis.  And then we went down, downstairs again because Janine was coming on.  We were like, you know, she sucks.  We'll go down.  So there's a monitor there.  There's a bar down there. 
[00:21:00]  So we're going to have some drinks.  So we're sitting there.  There's a monitor.  And Stinky and Big Kev and Keith were just like, oh, she sucks.  That FNC.  This and that.  And I'm sitting there looking.  There's a guy sitting right next to Stinky.  And he kind of looks like he's getting pissed at the time when we're saying this.  So I'm finding I pull him aside.  I pull Stinky aside.  I go, you know, maybe we should shut up.  Maybe that's like our manager or whatever.  So then when we went back up to see Brewer, we saw her, you know, say to Brewer, oh, my God, or whatever.  You know, oh, I got heckled.  And she comes down and that same guy tells her and, like, points her up. 
[00:21:30]  At that point, I'm just standing there.  She comes over and, like, crashes into me.  I used to say excuse me because I'm a gentleman.  She bumped you, man.  She bumped me.  She's a little midget.  She's about this tall with her sunglasses on and just bumped into me.  You should have popped her.  I should have.  That would have been funny.  Now, now, we don't hit girls.  Speaking of self.  Wow.  She just saw the whole thing.  It's like she chest bumped them like the guys doing football.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  All right, listen.  It's very obvious to us that we don't like her act.  But, I mean, was the crowd digging her act?  No.  Not at all, huh?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  It was like crickets, dude.  All right, let's go to Monique.  Monique, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The guy was sitting, like, two seats away from him.  Young guy.  So, when she stopped saying she couldn't see who it was, he stood up.  And he was waving his hat, like, yeah, what about it, you know?  Then after a while, security came in halfway through her act and was waiting for somebody to yell out something else. 
[00:22:30]  But he was yelling to other people, shut up, you know, sit on your dumb ass and this and that, you know.  Do you know what that guy looked like?  Yeah, young kid.  Wait, hold on, because we might have him on the line here.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Monique?  Hey.  What's going on?  Were you the guy heckling Janine Garofalo last night?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Monique, is this the guy, you think?  Yeah.  I had on a Yankee hat.  Exactly.  A gray shirt.  A gray shirt.  A gray shirt.  Yeah.  Now, what made you get up and let her know how you felt about the act? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, she was terrible, so I was just like, you suck, get off stage.  And she heard me because the whole crowd was silent.  Nobody was doing anything.  Oh, yeah, because no one's laughing.  Yeah, because Ben swore that he could hear that she was, like, all pissed.  She goes, usually my jokes don't bomb that bad.  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah.  She was saying, I haven't been this heckled since 1986.  That's where our material's from. 
[00:23:30]  Dude, she was terrible.  Hey, Monique, you should have been on that stage last night.  See, she got one laugh right there, Monique.  You should have been ahead.  All right.  Well, thank you, Monique.  All right, Dan.  Thanks, Steve.  No doubt.  Later, guys.  All right.  Someone's saying I'm being a whiner.  I don't think I'm whining today.  I mean, I do whine, but Janet?  Yeah.  Opie, Opie, you're like a little bitch.  All you do is whine.  Whine, whine, whine.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'll give you a chance.  What am I whining about today?  What's this reference to call the WB?  Maybe they'll give you an interview. 
[00:24:00]  You jealous of the chick?  What's your problem?  What?  You heard me.  Janet.  What's your problem?  And then you're going to dump out.  Janet.  Right?  No, I'm not dumping out.  I'll explain it if you shut your trap.  That wasn't, I wasn't doing a jab at the radio chick.  We were talking about radio divas, and WB11, or one of those stations, did a whole thing  on radio divas.  You're full of crap.  Oh, now he explains himself, and you're still saying he's full of crap.  Janet, that's exactly where it came from. 
[00:24:30]  Did you see the WB do the thing on the radio divas?  No, I didn't.  Oh, well, they did something on about five stations.  Janet, Janet.  They had five different radio divas.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Janet, I just explained myself.  And you still think it's a jab at the radio chick.  It wasn't.  That's all you do is jab at her.  That's all you do.  Earlier in the show, I jabbed at her, but you didn't even catch that one, because you're  so stupid.  Because your mother.  Oh, mother jobs.  Because your mother.  Your mother's in my knock house.  And Janet, why are you listening to my mother? 
[00:25:00]  Don't dump out.  Don't dump out.  Don't dump out.  No one's dumping anything, except you're dumping a big hot load all over your maw.  And Janet, if we're such whiners, why do you listen to us every day?  Yeah.  I didn't.  I happened to change.  I just happened to.  That old...  Hang up twat.  That old gag doesn't work anymore.  I hate that old gag, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, I usually don't listen to you guys, but I was reaching for my coffee, and my elbow  hit the, you know...  I just happened to hit it.  The second set of presets, which was a miracle in itself, and I came upon your wretched radio 
[00:25:30]  show.  The third sea of the day fell out of my mouth and hit the radio.  And all of a sudden, and the one that fell out of my A hit the tuning dial, and you guys  are on.  And I never knew you could spell mother M-A-W-V-A.  I couldn't turn the dial because my hands were so lubed up with man gunk.  You effing whore.  All right.  We got to give Janine, you know, equal rights here.  Joe? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah?  You thought Janine was good last night?  Yeah, I did, actually.  All right.  I think the problem was, you know, you had two guys right before that killed.  I mean, Louis Black was awesome, and then she shows up with her pace, and it just killed  it.  Of course it did.  How does that defend her, though?  No.  Her material was good.  Like, she was good just in the course of the guys she was around.  Joe.  I mean, Kevin Meany was awesome.  Louis Black was phenomenal.  Hey, can I ask you something about Kevin Meany?  Sure. 
[00:26:30]  Did he change his act?  No, he doesn't have to, though.  Oh, no.  Same act since 1983.  He doesn't have to.  I'm just asking.  He's funny.  I've seen it my entire life in the book.  You know what?  There's nothing wrong with that, because he does make me laugh, but that whole thing  about listening to Jimmy...  No, the Black Magic Woman, is it?  Yeah.  Black Magic Woman in his room, his mom yelling...  Like, Nick and Jack, son.  We're big pants people.  That's not right.  That's not right.  I mean, come on.  That's funny, though.  That was great.  No, I'm not trashing him for that.  I'm just asking if he, you know, it changes his act. 
[00:27:00]  See, if you're going to do the same act, it better be funny.  He did a little bit when he sung a song with Sinatra, and it was just dark.  Is he still doing the bit, oh, We Are the World?  He does that whole...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He finally dropped that out.  I guess.  Where he imitates all the voices and stuff.  I just saw him recently do that at Caroline.  How's that bit go?  I forgot, because I saw it literally 10 years ago.  He's singing We Are the World, and he does it as every other character.  Did he do that last night?  No, he didn't.  It was the Bruce thing, and he makes the faces. 
[00:27:30]  He mouths it to the real We Are the World song, which was really funny.  But he does it better than they do, so you can't even knock him for it.  He makes the faces.  We are the world.  He's got the big contorted Bruce face.  All right, Bonnie, it's like watching an old movie, though, an old comedy that you've  seen a thousand times, and you still laugh when it's on.  Exactly.  It's funny material.  Joe, let me put it this way.  We're not big fans of Janine Garofalo.  I've noticed.  I've listened enough to know that.  But you know what?  She continues to do stand-up, and people are hiring her, so whatever. 
[00:28:00]  You know what I mean?  Like I said, it wasn't that her material was bad.  I think in the course of that show, she didn't fit.  I mean, whoever put her in that slot was up their head up their ass.  I've seen a bunch of comics come home up in Boston, and she never seems to fit in.  Maybe if I just saw her.  Well, I saw her HBO special, and I went up through the whole hour.  I just, I hate that fakeness of like, look, I didn't have time to get ready for this, and  I'm working on it.  Even like you said, it's her bid.  It's her gimmick.  I know, but I don't know.  I just don't. 
[00:28:30]  I'm just not into it.  And that's fair.  I mean, that's because we don't like it.  She needs ten minutes to get the audience onto her speed, like to slow down to that speed.  Yeah, but at ten minutes, she was done.  But people don't have time for that.  They have lives, you know?  Like I said, I don't think she was right for that show.  Yeah.  I mean, Farrar came out and killed, what's his name, David Tell?  Yeah.  Came out with another great bit.  Everybody, even the host was like quick and sharp and fast.  You'll put your eye out. 
[00:29:00]  With her pace, I don't know why she was even on that show.  You'll put an eye out with that thing.  All right, Joe.  That's not right.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank God you're awesome.  Keep it up.  All right.  Rich Voss is on.  Does Rich have anything for the show he wants to talk to you, though?  Oh, okay.  If he has anything, put him on hold, all right?  Did Big Kev really try to steal Jim Groklo's book?  These sickos.  These sickos.  I don't know where I went.  I come back, and they have it all planned out how they're going to do it. 
[00:29:30]  I swear to God.  How the hell is Kevin going to run fast enough?  Yeah, really.  That is true.  We learned that last night.  They're going to lower him down on cables like a Mission Impossible?  I don't know.  What was their...  How was they going to do it?  Slowly lowering Kev down.  Look at the stress on those cables.  Hopefully, it'll hold, and he'll be able to grab the book.  Oh, he fell right through the gate.  How high were you guys that you're planning on stealing an Igorofalo joke book? 
[00:30:00]  What the hell is wrong with you guys?  How great was that?  And Big Kev is going to be your wingman.  I actually heard them talking about this this morning.  Like, yeah, Kevin was all psyched.  He was going to grab it and run.  But if anyone is going to steal the book and run and have a chance and get it away, it would  be Stink or Ben, not Big Kev.  You go through it.  It's just like...  It's a prop.  They're blank pages.  Hey, TJ, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  Hey, I really wanted to thank you for giving me those tickets to go last night, man. 
[00:30:30]  That was the funniest show I've ever seen.  Brewer killed, man.  That's very cool.  But Janine Grafalo, man, there wasn't...  You could hear a pin drop, really.  It was dead.  I was sitting right behind that guy who had Golder.  And, you know, not for nothing, but he was a fat loser.  As much as I, you know, hate Janine Grafalo, he looked like, oh, my God, he was disgusting.  Well, all hecklers come off like real a-holes, but I think it's kind of funny.  Yeah, new stuff I'm trying out just for tonight. 
[00:31:00]  But he just kept on standing up like he was a hero or something.  I just wanted to throw him over the balcony, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  But it, you know, hilarious.  Thank you.  Jim Brewer was the best.  Brewer!  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Radio Titans O&A.  Why?  I just got my card from the stretch factory in Brunswick.  Yeah?  And Brewer's playing on two shows in April. 
[00:31:30]  Called them immediately.  Sold out.  They're sold out?  The O&A show.  Sold out.  Can't get a ticket.  See, that's why we're warning you about Brian Regan coming to Caroline's next weekend.  I'm telling you, get your tickets in advance.  We're selling out all those shows for Brian.  He's great.  I'm doing it.  I heard Battle Boss Bill Dwyer had a great time with our listeners during his shows.  You should have heard him talk about his shows.  I go, hey, how are your shows, Bill?  He goes, you know, Thursday night there wasn't that many people there. 
[00:32:00]  It was really quiet.  I come in and do your show on Friday.  My shows are packed, but your listeners are a bunch of a-holes.  Yeah, you guys, sometimes you've got to be quiet and let the comics do their thing, man.  They're not quiet when we ask them to, but like for the XFL thing.  I know, I know.  You know, let's talk about Bill Dwyer that doesn't really understand us or our listeners yet.  You've got to like break them in slowly.  You know what it is, though?  And I think this is the God's honest truth.  They need a road show.  Yeah.  Because the road show, you can say whatever the F you want. 
[00:32:30]  Yell it out.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  And that's what I think our listeners need.  It's been a while.  Well, we're going to be doing a road show, hopefully, within a week.  Yeah.  We're going to get this together very, very quickly, so keep listening for details, all right?  Yeah.  I remember the first time I went to see Brian Regan when he realized that our listeners are a little off-center.  Yeah.  You know, he's doing his act.  He's done it a million times, and usually people just are quiet and listen and laugh,  and you laugh really hard when you see Brian Regan. 
[00:33:00]  And all of a sudden, we're sitting in Caroline's, and I swear to God, I wanted to go under the table,  because all of a sudden, people are just going, the big yellow ones are shut.  He didn't know what to do.  I know.  He's like, I've never been heckled by a comedy, you know, crowd before.  Heckled with his own material.  With his own material.  That's a new one.  So then he awkwardly tries to, like, you know, go into that bit, which was funny in itself, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Speaking of that, uh, you know, it was Rich Voskot today.  Rich.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  Who's this?  It's O&A.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up?  What was that, the business Voskot before you realized it's us?  Yeah.  Who is this?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, it's Opie and Andy.  Hey, hey, now I'm the zany Rich.  No, I didn't even, am I on the air?  Yeah.  Yeah, what do you mean?  No, we stopped the show to take your call.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, Ben's got something on Rich?  No, I don't know how Rich walks out of Comedy Clubs Live, because I then went and saw Rich.  I was going to go to, I went downtown and caught Rich.  You were frigging insane on stage, dude. 
[00:34:00]  With the black stuff and the Irish shit.  Well, you know what?  I got to do what I got to do to get by.  But I'm surprised you even realized what was going on.  Were you shooting beer into your arm?  That's our Ben.  Thank God.  Hey, Rich, you know, you see him in that state.  The first person he calls when he leaves these places is me.  Why?  And then tells me the same story before.  Ben, I understand.  I got all the details.  Thank you.  You should bail him out.  That's why he calls.  He's the best, man.  He is.  All right.  It was great.  It was great.  I heard the other show went great last night. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  That's a good foundation, too.  Cool.  Yeah.  So why did they put me on the air?  Oh, I don't know.  All right.  We'll put you back on hold.  I have nothing.  I have nothing to say anymore.  I have nothing today.  I am through.  I have nothing, man.  I'm hanging out with a great guest.  That's one of them.  Well, you're going to Amsterdam soon, right?  Yeah, I'm going to Amsterdam next week.  All right.  We'll have some stories then, right?  We've been looking at some websites from Amsterdam and seeing the hookers and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  They have some quality-looking hookers there. 
[00:35:00]  Rich, some guy sent me a ton of pictures from his trip to Amsterdam, and I'm like, I want to go.  They're not hookers.  They're window.  Now, okay.  That's what we want to know, because he showed us these pictures of these window models,  and you're assuming that's the girl you get to sleep with, because she's so hot.  She's in the window.  It's all red light.  No sleeping open.  They're beautiful.  Listen to me.  They're tense.  They're not.  These aren't, like, toothless, hunchback broads.  But you get the hot ones from the window?  These are the good girls. 
[00:35:30]  These are the girls that say no to Norton.  Listen to me.  Yes.  These are hot, hot girls, and it's 20 American.  I've never done it.  This is what I've heard.  Yeah, sure.  But can you do the girl that's in the window?  Yes.  Oh, see, we thought they were put there as, like, advertising.  Yeah.  And the real product's a little sleazy.  Then they open that back door, and there's, like, a bunch of toothless wonders coming at you.  No, it's all little.  They're all, like, separate little rooms, and they all have their, like, little room, and they bring you into it and stuff.  It's, listen, I mean, it's what my friend told me. 
[00:36:00]  And, uh.  Ah, yeah.  My friend told me, and you go into the room, and, you know, they say 100 Gilda, which is, like, 40 American.  Yeah.  And, you know, I say no 50 Gilda if I was going to do it.  And, yeah, I mean, you can't go prime time on a Friday or Saturday prime time.  You go later in the night or whatever.  Uh-huh.  Great deals.  Great deals.  I'm telling you.  I love it.  I'm going next week.  Yeah, well, call us when you get some stories, all right?  We saw the big pot tree.  There was just, like, pot growing on the sidewalk. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was, like, it was, like, an eight-foot pot tree right outside a coffee shop.  It's unbelievable.  Did I tell you I went to the Anne Frank house when I was there?  Yeah.  How they commercialized the Anne Frank house?  What did they do?  Well, you go to the fourth floor where she hid from the Nazis, and then you come down on a water slide.  A water slide, you know.  I went twice.  Sends you right through the gift shop.  Yeah.  I'm up at my manager's office, and all these girls are coming in for, like, this audition.  Are you here for the audition?  Yeah.  Hi.  Oh, you're going to have to read with me.  Okay.  There's a make-out scene, too. 
[00:37:00]  You don't do make-out scenes?  Okay.  My manager has an office where he's casting people, and all these hot girls are walking in.  Nice.  She just said she doesn't do make-out scenes.  Well, I guess she won't be working in Amsterdam.  All right, Rich.  We've got to take our break.  All right.  Can I speak to Rick?  Yeah.  It was good talking to you guys.  Definitely.  Hold it, Rich.  All right.  There he is, Rich Voss.  Psychomar.  Hey, what about the shower there?  It's got three nozzles at the Anne Frank house.  One for the hot water, one for the cold, and one for the cyclone baby. 
[00:37:30]  You are awful, man.  No, I was going to say, Ben called me 75 times last night, hammered out of his mind.  That's what Ben likes to make phone calls when he's drunk.  I love the hammered Ben.  I think we all know that.  I got to tape him someday.  If you guys think I'm bad, he is 15 times worse when he's drunk.  Say, hey.  That's going wrong.  No way.  That's impossible.  No, you are.  You're a complete full-blown alcoholic madman. 
[00:38:00]  Listen, it's coming from you.  You should know.  I'm the craziest.  No, you know, I do have a story to tell.  I went out with Ben and Psychomar once, and it's going to be hard to believe, but Psychomar  was so embarrassed to be in the same place as Ben, because Ben was losing his mind.  He was hammered, and Psychomar's like, dude, shut up.  Chill out.  Remember that, Mark?  He's the guy that has to hit you 15 times on the back in 30 seconds. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, dude.  Hey, what's up, dude?  Dude.  Hey, dude.  Hey, dude.  He was supposed to call me last night to go to the comedy show.  I said, call me at 10 o'clock, because that's when I get out of work, and I'll go.  He calls me a quarter of 11.  Is this true?  I'm hearing it's a stereotype that the Irish love to call people when they're drunk.  Is that true?  I personally put the ball down.  Because I know, I remember Psychomar would call a lot of people when he was hammered.  You do it now. 
[00:39:00]  You do it on our show.  I'm hammered right now, but what a Paul-a-thon show.  All right, Mark.  We've got to let you go.  Give him some AA treatment, will you?  All right.  Hey, your year anniversary's coming up.  Sorry, I hung up already.  This is your anniversary of the famous...  Yeah, St. Patrick's Day.  Remember, we did that event at La Barbat, and Mark proceeded.  He was already trashed, and then he went with Earl to New Jersey, and then he recorded...  Gotcha!  It's torture!  And we got there really fast. 
[00:39:30]  We'll play it going into break.  You may be part of the I can't think of this.  This is when Psychomar had a serious job around here, and would have fun on our show.  He was the production director, and he had to record some spots.  He was out hammered for St. Paddy's Day, and he came back to the station and recorded this.  Here's the video.  Here's the video. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, please.  Do you need me to read this?  I can't...  I can't...  I can't read this.  That's why I didn't cut it.  No, I can't...  All right.  Tuna.  It's all right.  We're running hot.  This is great, man.  It kills me.  This one's hilarious.  Here's a...  Mudslide's on TV here in the Discovery Channel. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, this is a great girl.  I like watching mudslides and trying to read copies at the same time.  Here's the community calendar on 1027 WNEW.  You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness.  Pleased to be an eye donor, and you may have someone to leave the gift of sight.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:41:00]  Get that bill!  Holy s***!  That's where that came from.  Torture and torture and gack, gack, gack, right there, back to back.  It all happened...  Two legendary sandbags.  That is classic.  You may have someone have the gift of sight thing.  He rules.  All right, we got to take our first break.  We got to get Stockbroker Dave on the phone.  The Dow is just...  It's a meltdown.  Oh, my God, it's a massacre. 
[00:41:30]  We got to talk to Dave, see how our boys are doing on the floor this week.  I'm sure they're hurting.  And also, Anthony...  Yeah.  Details...  Uh-huh.  On...  You have people wondering, we haven't brought this up.  Musical...  Dildo...  Chairs...  Right.  Details next.  Opie.  Oh, God, damn it!  No! 
[00:42:00]  No!  Oh!  No!  No!  Son of a bitch!  No!  Oh, God, damn it!  No!  Turn it on!  Turn it on!  I'm a mental case.  1027 WNEW.  Whatever, man. 
[00:42:30]  That's funny.  You got to warn me, though.  Seriously, look.  Even that promo gets Opie all weirded out.  He does not like vacuum cleaners.  Today in the office.  Remember that?  When Eddie came in?  Eddie!  Eddie came in to vacuum the office.  Live and lie, live and lie, live and lie.  Hey, there.  Where's the plug?  So he plugs in the vacuum.  And Opie sees him coming in with a vacuum and just starts freaking out. 
[00:43:00]  And when he turns it on, Opie had to leave the office with his arms waving in the air as he's walking out of the office.  Like, ow, ow!  It's just one of those things.  I can't explain it.  Is it the sound or does it have some kind of a thing, just the vacuum itself?  The sound goes right through me.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  I don't like it.  It really does.  We touched on it.  I mean, maybe my brothers could get involved.  We'll tell another family story.  But, um, my mom was a vacuum, a vacuuming freak.  Love the vacuum.  Love the vacuum. 
[00:43:30]  I guess when you're trying to keep a house clean that has seven kids in it, then you've got to do a lot of this stuff.  I don't know.  Cement dust in and whatnot.  Yeah, right?  And we'd be in the living room, you know, minding our own business, watching the little rascals or whatever was on TV.  And all of a sudden...  You were the little rascals from what I could tell.  And my mom would come in with her bathrobe, her blue bathrobe that was rotting, and her slippers that saw better days.  And start screaming, feed up! 
[00:44:00]  Feed up?  Yeah.  And she would clean the living room literally every half an hour.  What, every half hour?  It seemed like it, sure.  Because I know, you know, nothing on that whole scope.  But, uh, I think everyone's mom is a little psycho when it comes to that.  Because I know my mother always would, uh, Sunday morning.  She'd wake up and just lose her mother-effing mind.  Vacuuming.  Get up, dust!  This place looks like a bomb! 
[00:44:30]  Hit it!  Dust, that's right.  And we'd have to get the pledge out.  I'm dusting, I'm dusting, I'm dusting.  I'm doing this.  I'm vacuuming.  I'm, I'm windexing the glass top tables like little slaves around the house.  And then when you heard that phone ring, and you heard her answer the phone and go,  Hey, how the hell are ya?  And she starts talking and like, Oh, stand down.  Stand down.  Yeah.  And that's when you made your move.  You went up and went, Mom, God, the friends are out.  I'm going to go outside.  I'm going to go.  And then she just like, wouldn't even look at you, but she waved the hand like, Go, go, go, go.  Mom, I'm going outside and we're playing Evel Knievel. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And then, and then she just, Go, go, go.  Yeah.  And you'd be able to make your break.  One of the funniest things though, and it's not going to translate good to radio, but this  was one of those things in my family.  My mom would come into the living room with the blue bathrobe, screaming and yelling with  the vacuum and the slippers.  The same blue bathrobe for, I don't know, 15, 20 years.  We should have bought her a new one for Christmas, for Christ's sake.  So years later, we're, you know, we're older now.  We're like, we're, we're hanging out in my parents' house.  I don't know.  It might've even been a holiday and my parents were out. 
[00:45:30]  So, so all of a sudden we're watching TV and out of nowhere, uh, the same thing.  And the vacuum comes flying into the living room.  So we all look up like, ah, I can't believe my, you know, our mom is doing it.  We're now old and stuff, you know, older.  It's my brother, Brett, dressed in the ratty blue bathrobe.  He's put on the bathrobe.  Oh yeah.  Oh, this is right out of Psycho.  It was a Norman Bates moment.  My brother dressed up like my mom in her, in her, uh, ratty bathrobe and the slippers 
[00:46:00]  and had the vacuum going, imitating my mom's voice.  It's a classic to this day.  Were you, uh, laughing or horrified?  Well, at first we were, you know, horrified.  We were like, oh, God damn.  When is she going to, yeah, when is she going to give up on this vacuuming thing, you know?  But then when we turned and realized it was my, uh, my brother doing a really good impression  of my mom, it was hilarious.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is because it was always that Sunday.  You'd be sitting there trying to get through the, uh, 18 hours of Wonderama Sunday morning. 
[00:46:30]  And, uh, and she would just finally wake up.  Go, oh, brother.  Here it is.  You'd hear, you'd hear it stirring, you know?  You'd hear that she was awake.  The door shuts.  She goes in the bathroom.  The door shuts.  You're like, oh, getting all stressed out.  Well, here it comes.  Here it comes.  She walks in.  What is this?  That, your place looks like a wreck.  What, are you living in a hovel?  Clean up.  It's just, oh, God, Mom, I know you're miserable.  Did they have to pass it on to everybody else?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:47:00]  I guess she, you know, she's obviously past that point and me and Joe and Dawn talked to  her about it and stuff.  She's like, I got to apologize.  I wasn't a happy person back then.  No, no crap.  You ain't got to tell me, Mom.  Jesus.  Clean up.  It was like, clean up.  You know, Mom?  If I knew back then as a kid, I'd go, Mom, no matter how much we clean this house, it's  not going to cleanse you of your miserable feelings.  See, what you're doing is trying to...  Don't lie your haggers!  Help her! 
[00:47:30]  Just because Dad's an a-hole doesn't mean you have to take it out on your children.  You have to pass it off to us.  I can understand me and Joe, we kind of look like them and stuff, but Dawn, you don't have  to treat her like a little ragamuffin.  I mean, we were one second away from it's a hard knock, life, life, you know.  Like, we're just dancing around with the mops.  It's awful.  Boy, there's not going to be a sick pick-up on FBAnthony.com in the very near future. 
[00:48:00]  JJ, what's up?  Hey, what's up, both?  Same goddamn thing with me.  With the vacuum?  Yeah, it kills me.  I don't know what it is, but I mean, like when Eddie was vacuuming the back office today,  everyone was looking at me, waiting for that reaction.  I'm like, guys, I'm not going to, like, fake it and do an over-the-top thing, you know,  and I just had to get out of the office.  It just kills you for the day or it puts you in such a bad mood?  No, I just feel the hair on the back of my neck.  It just stands up and my head actually will twitch to the side.  It was, he was twitching, he was twitching. 
[00:48:30]  Dude, dude, all of a sudden, just before he hit that liner, Ben looks at me, he goes,  and he just points, points to you, Opie, he goes, watch.  And I look, and all of a sudden, all you hear is meh, and I see your head just twitch  and, like, almost like you got stuck on your shoulder with your head.  It was hilarious.  So, JJ, you don't like the vacuum either, huh?  No, it kills me, it kills me.  And my mom's same way, it's just a blue one now.  But do you know why?  No, I don't know why.  None of my other brothers and sisters have this problem either.  Yeah.  Just me.  All right, cool. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Thanks, JJ.  Yeah, parents don't know what they're doing sometimes.  Things that you never, that you just think is something in passing just sticks with you forever.  You know, look at that, see?  Now that's something that'll just be with you forever.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, Paul.  Hey, what's up, man?  I get, listen to this.  I get home from work.  Every freaking day this happens, I walk home.  My mom's got the white around the goddamn nostrils.  I walk into the bathroom.  The mirror's off the friggin' wall.  There's razor blades all over the place. 
[00:49:30]  And she cooks me a goddamn dinner.  And she's acting like she's my, she's a good friggin' mother.  I'm sick, very old man.  Wait, wait, watch the cursing.  I won't call it.  Paul, are you trying to say your mom's a coke head?  I hate when my mom gets coke and tries to cook me dinner.  She's sniffing coke.  Look, I, I've caught, uh, I used to, I used to do K, and I caught her doing K one time.  She sniffs coke every goddamn day.  Every, sometimes I think she cooks with it.  She'll cook up some bread or something, and I'll eat it, my lips are getting numb, I'm 
[00:50:00]  feeling a little goddamn hyper, I don't know what's going on.  Makes a great marinoid.  Yeah.  Wow, that's heavy duty.  Wow.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  I learned it from you, okay?  I learned it from you.  That's heavy.  I don't know.  Dave.  Dave, you're next on WNEW.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Hey, listen, I'm mentally scarred from my mother vacuuming. 
[00:50:30]  All I do is vacuum now.  It's crazy.  I'm mentally, I'm mentally scarred from that.  She used to vacuum at seven in the morning.  It was insane.  I'm just the opposite.  It was crazy.  Some people get hammered into, uh, being like these clean freaks when their mother does  that to them.  Oh, I got it.  Clean up, clean up.  Now I'm just like, no, my, no, see, my mom would come into our rooms if our shoes were  out of place, we'd, you know, she would scream her head off.  Yeah.  So I went the other way, man.  I'm, I am as, uh, I'm a slob. 
[00:51:00]  She made me go the other way.  See?  Yeah.  I'm a complete slob.  That's what I do.  I remember all the, and this was another thing my mom used to do.  She'd, uh, do the laundry, fold up the clothes, and put them on our beds.  And we would just not put them away.  Yeah.  We'd go to bed and have our clothes on the end of the bed.  You know?  So I'm in there, and she'd be like, why can't I, you know, I do the laundry, I put it in  there, I ask you to do one thing, put it in the bed, in the, in the dresser.  And I'm just like, you brought it all the way in here.  Why couldn't you finish the job?  All right, let me ask you this. 
[00:51:30]  Put it in the drawer.  It's in your arms.  Let me ask you this.  That didn't go over well, believe me.  So if you, yeah, but let me ask you this.  What?  I will top this.  So what happens if you don't put the clothes away, Anthony?  No, because then I go, all right, I'll put them away, and then I put them away until  the next time when I don't, and she yelled again.  Why?  What happened when you didn't put them away?  Well, in our house, your whole room would end up on the driveway.  No, stop.  Oh, yeah.  Now you're getting so much.  Oh, no. 
[00:52:00]  She would take everything in your room?  Oh, it would go from one extreme to another.  Like if she, like, put the clothes on a dresser, and maybe a day went by, and the clothes were  still not put away or whatever.  Oh, no.  There was no talking back.  You come home from school, and your stuff is outside.  Oh, yeah.  The whole room on the driveway.  That's a little weird, man.  Oh, oh, oh.  Wow.  All right.  And then once we just got old enough, it all became silly. 
[00:52:30]  Like, essentially, try to yell at us, and we just leave.  You know, going out.  Screw this.  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break, because we went late in our first segment.  We're going to come back and talk about our cute little game called Musical Dildo Chairs.  Mm-hmm.  Could go down as the best bit we've ever done.  Oh, yeah.  And we'll give you the details next.  Our Howard by O.P. and Anthony.  Groovy, New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[00:53:00]  Look.  Hey, what would carbon sound like, uh, smoking pot?  That's three.  You guys, I am so relaxed right now.  Can I get a cookie, please, man?  Man, can I get a cookie?  I want a skew to pie.  Man, can I get some pancake and a surprise? 
[00:53:30]  That's three.  Everything looks so kind of cool.  Look, you guys.  Toss your eating processes.  I'm so hungry.  I feel like I'm floating.  Gentlemen, Doug, you're wacky.  Are you messing me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, it just lets me hang out.  Oscar, what's up?  Hey, what's up there, buddy?  We stay talking to my mother's, right?  Yeah, the last guy was talking about his mom being a coke whore.  His mom being a coke whore.  Well, mine's not quite that bad.  Well, maybe it is.  My mom's been in and out of institutions my whole goddamn life.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I wake up last night, right?  I'm a little bit thirsty.  It's the middle of the goddamn night.  I walk past the family computer. 
[00:54:30]  It's 80 minutes because I don't use the goddamn thing.  Wide open, I see some guy's man junk staring at me.  I walk downstairs a little bit.  My mom's sitting on the goddamn couch smoking cigarettes, watching the Home Shopping Network.  Naked.  What naked?  My mother.  My mother, this is.  She's a freaking screw loose.  I don't know what the hell to do with her.  Naked moms and coke whore moms.  Oh, God.  You don't want to see that.  Say what?  No, I see that. 
[00:55:00]  Never mind.  You ever see your mom naked?  Never.  I've seen my mom naked, unfortunately.  I saw my mom's boobie once.  Oh.  Yeah.  Believe me, I saw a lot more than that last night.  Let me tell you.  Cutshog.  Cutshog motorhead.  Cutshog motorhead.  What happened, Opie?  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're done.  We were staying at the Cutshog motorhead while our house was being rebuilt.  This was in the late 70s.  Mom bent over to change, I think, my brother's diaper, and there it was. 
[00:55:30]  Boo.  What'd you do?  Was it nice?  My mom's stack.  It's a little weird.  Did you look away really quick, or did you keep staring?  I guess the answer would be, you know, you look away real fast.  But no, you're like, oh my God, that's mom's boobie.  Oh, no.  Dude.  That's awful.  What about our huge big hooters, huh? 
[00:56:00]  That's not very right.  Well, what do you do?  It's right there.  Can't make believe you didn't see it.  You should just look away as quickly as possible and bury it deep down somewhere and saw it.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Dr. Smith?  That's horrible.  Did it affect you?  Nah.  Didn't feel all creeped out?  No, because it wasn't like she was displaying it for me. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe it was just one of those things, you know?  She had her bathrobe on or her nightie, and it was there when she bent over.  It wasn't like, hey, son, check this out.  Ugh.  And yeah, it would be disturbed.  Stockbroker Dave.  Dave.  David.  Hey, boys.  Hey, what's up?  Not the market.  Tired.  Oh, look at you.  I've never heard you like this.  Long effing day.  You're beaten.  I'm beaten. 
[00:57:00]  What's the final stats on the market today?  Nothing below.  NASDAQ below 2,000?  Uh, NASDAQ, NASDAQ, 1972.  It was 5,000 a year ago.  1972.  They had that 5,000 party.  It lasted for a minute.  It's below 2,000 now.  Yeah, below 10,000.  It's the first time in two years.  99.73.  What do you say?  Recession?  It blows.  We are cursing.  Wait, don't curse.  Dave, I've never heard you like this. 
[00:57:30]  I understand.  It's horrible.  How much would you say you dropped today?  Six figures.  You lost six figures just lately?  Six figures today.  Not a...  It's just...  Oh, this week.  Not today.  This week.  This week.  That was weird.  A little echo thing.  Who are the big losers?  Uh, basically, techs suck.  Telecommunications suck. 
[00:58:00]  The brokerages are getting killed.  Everything.  Listen to me.  I'm looking at the screen.  Everything is red.  He sounds to shame.  We've known you for a long time.  We've never heard you like this before.  I checked my stocks.  I'm like, oh, look.  I'm surviving.  They didn't go down too much today.  And then I realized, wait a minute.  These stocks can't go down any further.  No.  You can't go below zero.  Yeah, exactly.  You can't go below zero.  Who am I kidding?  These things...  Ugh.  Have we found a bottom?  Not even close.  There's no panic selling yet. 
[00:58:30]  That's the thing that scares me.  Like, every day, it's 1.2 billion.  You've got to see over 2 billion shares trade.  When you see that, that's the bottom.  Yeah.  But it's not that big.  You know, it's orderly selling, which is the thing that's annoying.  Everyone's just getting out.  I came in today.  I was listening to the...  I saw the futures.  Everything was down, down, down.  I figured it was going to be down 600 on 2-point-something billion today.  Who's going to get it all over?  Hey, Mike is saying you don't know nothing.  Dow is below 10,000 in October.  Tell Mike to suck, Mike.  Oh, this could be good.  Hold on. 
[00:59:00]  You can tell them yourself.  Mike.  Yo.  Hey, you're on with Stockbroker Dave.  Hey, I hope you're not investing other people's money.  Why?  What's the problem?  Dow was below 10,000 in October of this past year.  Not two years ago.  What do you work for?  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  He's listening to him.  Yeah, Dave doesn't want to hear this stuff today.  He's all, he's all, uh...  Dave, you're going to go drinking? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  I wanted to invite you in to play, uh, you know, Win Stockbroker Dave's Money, but I  don't think you have it, Dave.  Yeah.  What's the deal with a different dollar?  Remember those days you'd come in with that big wad of cash?  Yeah.  It's not...  Oh, remember?  You're talking about Stockbroker 2 losing 15 pounds?  Yeah.  Yeah, we lost some pounds today.  I imagine you did.  Aw.  Quite annoying.  Quite annoying.  You used to show off that wad.  Not anymore, huh?  No, there's no wad.  All right.  Listen to him. 
[01:00:00]  Wife's going to leave me.  My kids are going to hate me.  I feel bad for him.  Yeah.  Oh, you poor bastard.  When can we look for, uh, an upswing?  Anthony, you need a day that has over 2 billion shares with it flushed out.  So we need, like, a 600-point loss?  With 2 billion shares.  With 2 billion shares.  When you see that, that's the bottom.  Dave, can I put you on hold for a sec?  Sure.  You never know if this stuff is true, but I've got to go to Victor really fast.  Victor! 
[01:00:30]  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  How's it going?  You know, there's some freak over here at 59th Street.  You know, dude, you...  Obviously, uh, that was fake.  That's all I had to do to you.  There you go.  I thought it was fake, but it was worth a shot.  Anyway, go ahead, Dave.  So we need a big...  We need even a bigger loss?  Uh, you need...  You just need volume, and we haven't had volume.  Every day, it's the same thing.  Every day, it's the same thing.  Oh, yeah, you heard of, uh... 
[01:01:00]  Nothing to look forward to.  Great.  On a more important note, um...  I invested in Brewer's new movie.  Did you hear anything about his new movie?  You did?  Yeah.  You're not kidding?  I am not kidding.  Uh, I don't know.  Uh, it's...  We saw some of it.  It looks great.  What'd you think about it?  What, is it crossing the line?  What, his concert film or something else?  No, something else.  Oh, I don't know.  That's still...  I guess it's too early on that.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, Brewer's in it, uh...  Otto and George?  No.  Not that one? 
[01:01:30]  Hey, Michael, who else is in Brewer's movie?  Michael!  Who else is in Brewer's movie?  Bert Young from, uh...  Oh, okay.  We did hear a little bit about that.  I think it's...  Tony Darrow from Goodfellas.  Tony Darrow from Goodfellas?  Yeah.  I heard a little bit about that.  Yeah, so we put some money.  Colin Quinn.  Cool.  Good lineup.  You heard nothing about it?  No, not yet.  I think it's too early.  Okay.  Yeah, don't worry.  That's the only thing I got going for me right now.  All right, Dave.  All right, boys.  We'll let you go.  All right, kids.  All right.  I'll speak to you soon. 
[01:02:00]  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  We've never heard shockbroker Dave sound like that.  He's a broken man.  He is a broken man.  Another mom story coming in.  Anthony, where are these coming from?  Bruce, what's up?  Yo, man.  You kind of brought back some memories.  Remember Sonny Fox on Wonderama?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, well, when I was a kid, man,  I walked in.  You know how you walk in  to your mom and dad doing it?  That never happened.  Never happened.  I said, oh, my God, boy. 
[01:02:30]  He was telling me,  he was telling me, he was going to kill you  when you're knocking on the door.  I said, oh, my God.  Right?  So you walked in when your dad was,  you know, trimming up mom.  I just saw some legs open  and a razor blade, man.  I said, oh, my God.  Stay out the bushes.  And then you know what was funny?  Huh?  When I became an adolescent  and I started shaving,  my father walked in,  I'm going to shave my face.  And he goes, hey, son,  what are you shaving?  I said, are you still shaving?  And he said, you son of a bitch,  you remember that day? 
[01:03:00]  Thank you, Bruce.  Hey, I wanted to, you know.  You shared.  You know?  All right.  All right.  Go to Kevin.  Kevin, you're next on WNAW.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  Hey.  The musical dildo show  is going to be bigger  than the friggin' Super Bowl.  Musical dildo chairs, yes.  Listen up, guys.  Yeah.  I'm having a musical dildo chair party.  I'm getting little jello cutouts of dildos.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm getting,  I have a chair-shaped pizza cutter 
[01:03:30]  for my pizza pies.  And then we're going to have  little pizza pie chairs  with dildo jello on top.  Very good.  That's for the Dildo Super Deluxe  Dildo Musical Chair Show  on the ONA Show.  All right.  We've got to give the details now, Kev.  Thank you.  Well, listen to this.  Not only that,  I've got my girl, right?  She's going to be wearing an apron  giving out raffle tickets.  And every time a girl  gets grouped up in the veal flaps,  somebody's going to win a prize.  All right.  Cool.  Have fun.  Keep up the veal.  All right. 
[01:04:00]  Veal flaps.  Anthony,  in case people weren't listening,  late in the show yesterday,  it got great around here.  Well, yeah, we...  It was a slow-moving show yesterday,  but we ended with a bang.  We came up with a great new idea.  Yeah, another bit we obviously ripped off.  Musical dildo chairs.  Right.  Now, we made a promise to the lawyers in Cannes  that we would play this very carefully on the air. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, of course.  So, when we actually play it on Friday,  we might have to make it sound like  it's mostly just musical chairs.  Right.  But the faithful listeners will understand  and we'll explain as much as we can.  We will use words like  the appliance.  Right.  The apparatus.  Correct.  The device.  Correct.  But you will know  we are talking about...  Dildos.  Yes.  It's code.  And, you know, when you play musical chairs, 
[01:05:00]  you need, like, you know, music, obviously.  John Valby will be playing the music live.  Live soundtrack to musical dildo chairs  supplied by John Valby.  Dr. Dirty.  It's going to be a great show Friday.  Can you just picture him playing his piano?  That cheesy party music.  So, Anthony, the details, if you will.  Well, we have...  How many girls so far  are saying that they're going to do this?  At least 20.  20 girls.  And we're not stopping.  Ladies, any more ladies  want to get in on this call?  Yeah, we have a trip up for grabs.  Yep. 
[01:05:30]  To Wrestlemania in Houston, Texas  for you and a friend.  What the...  We're overbooking this event  because we need the girls to show up.  We will have girls  and we will have chairs  and we will have  these various apparatus.  Wink, wink.  Nudge.  Right.  The girls will then  walk around the chairs  just like in musical chairs  as John Valby plays a song.  When the music stops,  they must  be on a chair.  Yeah, you can just say  sit down. 
[01:06:00]  They've got to sit down.  What's dirty about that?  There's nothing dirty about...  Sitting down?  Sitting.  No.  Musical dildo chairs.  Right.  You're laughing at that, Joey.  And we will be  confirming that  the ladies  are sitting.  Are seated.  Correct.  Yes.  Yes.  Confirmation of veal flaps.  Very...  This contest  is very similar  to sex 
[01:06:30]  for sad.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Where we have people  that have to confirm  what is going on.  Right.  There must be confirmation  that these girls  are indeed sitting  properly  in their chair.  If I could say that,  the last girl standing  will win the trip  to WrestleMania  when it's finally over.  When it's over.  Yeah.  Hopefully,  we're going to start  with like 20 girls.  Now, obviously,  there's one less chair  than there is girl.  Right.  So, when they all sit,  one girl is not going to be...  She's going to be left  standing up. 
[01:07:00]  She's out.  Yeah.  Then, we take away a chair  and an appliance apparatus,  whatever you want to call it.  Right.  And the rest of the girls  go around  and we repeat this  over and over  and over again  until there are  two girls left  and one chair  and one appliance.  and when the music stops,  whoever is in a seated position  wins the prize.  There you go.  There you go.  Someone check with Ken  and see if we explain  that correctly for him.  I think we're doing 
[01:07:30]  a great job.  He's a little nervous.  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Hello?  Thank God she's not there.  I want to come in  for the contest.  That's what she was  going to say.  Can I be here  for the contest?  It's going to be great.  I'll just think about...  I'll be...  God.  She can make something 
[01:08:00]  that is so hot.  Just horrid.  Just horrid.  Horrid.  All right.  Jack, what's going on?  Are you going to keep score  with Stalker Patty's  nipple hairs?  Yeah.  Listen,  anybody fun to fish yet?  I guess not, huh? 
[01:08:30]  Hang up on him.  I don't know what he means.  Ouch.  Oops.  What fish?  Okay, we've got to take a break.  Anthony, remember Chuck Farnham?  Who could forget Chuck?  He's our freak,  freaky guy contact  out there in California.  He does things  that are just out there.  You might remember him  punching a girl's boobs.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Because she asked for it.  She wanted it.  Well, that was her fetish.  And he sells various jewelry  made out of human finger bones.  And he will sell you  a bracelet made out of  your own pubic hair  that you mailed to him.  And he fashions into  a nice little bracelet.  Just some of the stories  he has told on our show.  He unloaded on his cat.  That's right.  He's got some new  stories to tell.  New stuff for Easter.  Easter treats.  With Chuck Farnham next.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  Fun band tour. 
[01:09:30]  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, what's up?  This is Gino.  And this is Richard.  And we're from the band Filter.  And you're listening to our friends  Opie and Anthony  on 1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those guys were so  effing cool  when they came by  for a visit.  Too bad they were  so hammered  they might not remember  they were ever here. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  It's been hard  to get them back on the show.  We had a lot of fun with that one.  Well, they're in between albums, Anthony.  Yeah.  In between CDs.  212-757-1027.  Drudge Jr.  on the phone.  All right.  Drudge Jr.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I have a new story  about WNEW.  We had somebody  on the hold  that said they were  Drudge Jr.  And then they hung up.  That person was lying.  Ah.  Are you saying  someone is impersonating you,  Drudge Jr.?  Probably that same Derek. 
[01:10:30]  So you don't have  any new news  on WNEW?  I'm working on something  but nothing yet.  What are you working on?  No.  Come on.  What are you working on?  Something about your contract  and some other guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You all know who he is.  All right.  Some other guy  and our contract.  Yes.  All right.  And you're working on this.  I'm not going to say anything now  because I don't want  to get in trouble  like I did last time  with the fake store.  In the Drudge Jr.  newsroom.  Yes.  So you're working on 
[01:11:00]  a story about our contracts.  Yeah.  How are you working on it  if you're on the phone  right now?  Are there reporters  running around your house  or your room?  Kind of.  You got some leads  though, right?  Yeah.  All right.  You'll call us  when you have something  concrete?  Yes, I will.  Let us know  because RGM  doesn't tell us anything.  Right.  Tell you what.  Put me on hold  with Stinky again.  Why?  I have to ask him something.  Stinky's the source.  Hi, Stinky. 
[01:11:30]  No, no.  It's not Stinky.  I just want to...  Wait, get Stinky in there.  No, it's not  anything about him  being a source.  Stinky, are you deep throat?  Are you the source?  Are you just...  That's what he said?  No, he goes,  put me on hold.  I have to ask Stinky something.  Are you the source?  I just want to make sure  that...  I just want to make sure  nobody fakes me again  and...  Oh, code word.  Oh, you're going to  give a little code word.  Nice.  You are smart.  Not bad for a 13-year-old kid.  But the thing was,  it was him that called before.  It was the same voice. 
[01:12:00]  No, it wasn't me.  All right.  It wasn't me.  I haven't called up  at all today.  All right.  An impression.  Any other stories  you're working on  besides us?  Not really.  Nothing, huh?  Mm-hmm.  No controversies  at your school?  No, not really.  All right.  Hold on.  There he goes.  Christina,  what's going on?  Hello?  Hold on, hold on,  hold on.  Hello?  I'm Little Tom Brokaw  from Little NBC Nightly News.  I'm just reporting. 
[01:12:30]  He's my hero.  Tom Brokaw is my hero  and I had the same list  that he has.  So I figured I'd follow  in his footsteps  as Little Tom Brokaw.  Hello?  Little Tom Brokaw,  Little NBC Nightly  and Little News.  Breaking story,  Opie and Anthony's contract,  they will sign  for somewhere between  $2 and $200 trillion  gazillion billion billion.  Tom Brokaw,  Little Tom Brokaw,  Little NBC,  Little Nightly,  Little News,  Little.  Can you say, uh...  What? 
[01:13:00]  Say little with his list.  Can you say Achille Laura?  Achille Laura.  Oh, see,  I can't say it  just like my hero,  Tom Brokaw.  It's me,  Little Tom Brokaw,  signing off.  New character  born on the show today.  Christina,  what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I'm coming in  for the Best Ass Contest  tomorrow.  All right.  Yeah, the Best Ass Contest  continues.  We have a trip to give away  to Las Vegas  thanks to Gear Magazine.  Also want to thank  Corny Goatweed  for sponsoring  the Best Ass Contest  and you'll be here tomorrow.  Definitely. 
[01:13:30]  I have a job interview  at Meyer,  Brandon, Platt  and then I'm walking  right over.  All right, cool.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Well for me,  but I think when her mom  got the bill.  I'm assuming, though,  you don't have just  normal phone sex  with these ladies.  Well, no.  There's kind of a twisted  angle to your phone sex.  Well, I like to go  the extra mile.  Yeah?  You want to explain  a little or?  I don't think we can.  All right.  You're not hacking  anybody up in these  conversations.  No, no, no, no, no.  But they like it.  They all seem to have  a good time whenever,  you know,  I mean, it doesn't happen  often, but when it does 
[01:14:00]  happen, they always come  back until their phone  bill reaches about  $7.00 or $8.50 a month  and then they go away.  All right.  There you go.  So what's going on?  Well, I was down in Vegas.  For the porn awards?  Because I love the Vegas.  Yeah.  Yeah, Vegas.  You fit right in there.  We're giving away a trip  to Vegas.  Really?  As part of our  Best Ass contest.  Wow.  And where are people  staying?  Do we know?  Vegas.  Vegas?  It's on the strip  somewhere?  Not in Las.  It's Vegas.  Vegas?  I was both.  Las and Vegas. 
[01:14:30]  I spent the better  part of four days  with a dwarf.  With a dwarf?  A dwarf chick  or a dwarf guy?  Dwarf guy.  Uh-oh.  All right, Chuck.  What were you doing?  Let me strap in here.  Yeah, get your belts  on, people.  Well, because I don't  put anything past you  because you once said  you like going out  and picking up  transvestites  and having them  crank it right next  to you in the  passenger seat.  Is that a frog?  Just to check it out.  By the way, Chuck... 
[01:15:00]  Well, you know,  one should experience  everything.  You don't have to get  completely into it  to experience it.  Chuck backs up  all his stories,  by the way.  All right.  I've got pictures.  So you were in Vegas  and you spent the better  of four days  with a dwarf.  With a dwarf.  Well, see,  here's how it started.  When I was a kid,  way back when,  I grew up with this guy  by the name of Bobby Emmett  and he was twin dwarfs.  Okay?  Him and his brother.  Him and his brother dwarfs.  Right.  And we were,  you know,  I'm from Montana  so it was kind of  a cowboy thing.  We used to do  cowboy bars together 
[01:15:30]  at night  and Bobby wouldn't spend  more than about  when he was on.  Chicks would take him  out to their car  and do amazing things  with him.  I, of course,  I, of course,  watched through the window.  Chicks digging  the little people.  Of course.  Okay.  So, you know,  I knew that this was  going on  and it was a good thing.  So now,  I get to Vegas.  First thing I run into,  I'm at the porn show.  First thing I run into,  dwarf.  And sure enough,  right there in the middle  of the show floor, 
[01:16:00]  he's doing it.  You're watching a dwarf  doing it?  Oh, yeah.  Clearly doing it.  I mean,  not kind of doing it,  really doing it.  I took pictures.  You have pictures  of this dwarf  having sex  in front of everybody?  In front of everybody.  Well, you know,  there was a couple hundred people.  He was having sex  with a porn star?  No, he was having sex  with anybody who wanted to.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  Guys, girls,  didn't matter?  Yeah, it did not matter at all.  And I'm thinking,  this is going to be  a hell of a week.  Right? 
[01:16:30]  Understatement.  Okay.  So I introduced myself.  Hey, I'm Chuck.  I'm weird.  I'm Chuck.  How nice of you.  I really like your work.  And he's like,  really?  Nobody ever told me that before.  And so we kind of  struck up a little friendship.  And he was staying over  at the Mirage.  And so we went over there.  He goes,  you know,  come on up.  You know,  blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like,  sure, fine.  No problem.  And I get up there.  The little monkey  has got chicks coming in 
[01:17:00]  and guys coming in  all night long.  Crawling up my little body.  Was it Gary Coleman?  What?  Was this Gary Coleman?  No, it didn't.  Come on, to be honest.  Was he a black guy,  a white guy?  No, he was a white guy,  but he had the little  short stubby arms.  Okay.  And the really big head.  That's a dwarf.  That's a dwarf.  That's a dwarf, right?  Yeah, sure.  Not a midget.  That's a dwarf.  That's a dwarf, yeah.  Okay.  Was he hung?  About eight inches.  All right.  I mean, 
[01:17:30]  it was one of the  strangest looking things  I've ever seen.  And I'm down there  with my nephew  and some other people, right?  Uh-huh.  And my nephew  never really  spent any time  around me before.  Oh, that's great.  You take your nephew.  Right.  How old is your nephew?  He's 22.  Oh, okay.  So, my nephew's  sitting there.  You're all in the  dwarf's hotel room.  Dwarf's hotel room, right?  Yeah, and girls and guys  coming and going.  Coming and going,  and my nephew's like,  does this happen often?  Now, why are they  coming and going  into the room there?  Just to take a peek  at a naked dwarf?  Well, no, no, no. 
[01:18:00]  Well, because that's  his thing.  Apparently,  apparently these chicks  like to be done  by the huge dwarf.  All right.  Huge meaning, yeah.  Huge meaning, you know.  Yeah, go.  So, they go in here  and get done  by this dwarf.  While they're like  boyfriends and husbands,  watch.  What?  What the?  Apparently, he plans  this trip every year.  They come over to Vegas.  He gets the room  and then they, like,  you know, 
[01:18:30]  they have appointments  or something.  All right.  So, did you,  well, continue with your story.  You hung with him  for four days.  Four days of this.  After about three days  of it, I'm going,  you know,  what do you do  for a living?  He goes,  I'm a cab driver.  I'm like, what?  He goes, no,  I'm a cab driver  in Denver.  All right.  And I'm like,  okay, fine.  And he goes,  yeah, it's been like this  forever.  And then I go,  wait a second,  forever.  I go,  I knew this guy, 
[01:19:00]  Bobby Emmett.  And when I was in high school  and he goes,  yeah, exactly.  He goes,  we used to always get  the chicks in high school.  Nobody thought we'd get them.  And now we do.  And now we do.  Now it's happening,  you know,  it just continued to happen  and people don't think  they have sex.  It went on forever.  All right.  So the people are coming  and going into the hotel room  and you're just,  this is what you did.  I sat on the couch  for four days  and watched this guy  do it with  guys' wives  and took pictures. 
[01:19:30]  You lead some life.  Did you decide  to participate yourself?  No, no.  I mean,  I really don't want  to have sex  with a male dwarf.  But you didn't,  did you,  I mean,  I watched him have sex.  Did you crank one out?  A couple of times.  Chuck.  Everybody else  is doing it.  Is there anywhere  to,  if anyone wants  to see these pictures,  they can see them?  I could,  you know,  probably mail some out  to some folks.  That's not even why  I called up.  It's funny we should  mention that.  Oh, all right. 
[01:20:00]  So, all right.  So you hung out  with a dwarf.  I hung out with a,  that was pretty much  the only thing going on  in the entire CES show  this year  was the dwarf thing.  And you struck up  a nice conversation,  you had some beers,  and you watched them  do everyone's wives.  For about,  well,  about three nights,  I guess,  by the time I got tired of it.  Was he having sex  with guys?  No, no.  The guys always sit  at the end of the bed  and watch, too.  They would watch their chicks  getting done  by this dwarf.  Right.  But he was,  he was huge. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  We understand.  He's not like  your average dwarf.  He wasn't,  this guy looked  like a small tripod.  I'm sure he looks  extra huge  because he has  the small body.  Well, he has  the kind of  proportional body,  but the small legs  and the small arms.  Right.  Big head.  Maybe he was just  using a leg.  Could have been.  And he had a fake leg  next to it,  and you thought  it was his jump.  Well, it's weird.  Have you ever seen  a dwarf do it?  No.  I can't say I have.  They kind of lean  into it. 
[01:21:00]  Because it's too  high for him.  It's too high for him.  Yeah, they kind of  have to get up  on one foot  and kind of...  You just gave me  the best visual  of the day.  Lean into it.  I completely understand.  He's got to get  kind of up on his toes  a little bit.  Right, right.  No, it's definitely  kind of a  Jethro Tull-ish  or a nip thing  going on.  Does he use  the ladies like me  to kind of like  boost himself up a bit?  Exactly.  Yeah, okay.  I got it.  Remember that  for the end of the show  today.  Dwarfs have to  lean into it.  We learn something 
[01:21:30]  every day on this show.  Trying to help.  Yeah, Ozzy has a good  question on four.  Did you crank one out  with nephew  right next to you?  No.  Oh, you got morals.  Did your nephew  get any?  No.  No?  No, he's a little  too straight for this.  I mean, he's probably  not so straight  into it anymore.  Paul on line three  is depressed  because the dwarf  is bigger than him.  That dwarf's bigger  than almost anybody  I've seen before.  But that's not  the reason you called.  You hung out  with the dwarf  at the porn convention 
[01:22:00]  for three or four days.  Yeah, that was good.  No, I called  because Easter's coming.  Easter.  Uh-oh.  One of the holiest  times of the year.  Chuck, what are you  doing for Easter?  I created  a collection  of stuffed rabbits  and we've  taxidermied  real human teeth  into them.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, wait.  So you have  these rabbits.  They're real rabbits.  Well, they're  stuffed rabbits.  Killed and stuffed.  Where did you get  the rabbits?  Stuffed animals.  Where did you get  the rabbits? 
[01:22:30]  Well, they're stuffed animals.  Oh, stuffed animals.  Okay.  And I do have  some stuffed rabbits  here, too,  but they're not  for sale.  Okay, so they're  not authentic  animals that are stuffed.  No, they're stuffed animals  like, you know,  your fuzzy, cuddly,  thumper variety.  Yeah.  And then we've  taxidermied  real human  and animal teeth  into them.  Why?  Because they look  vicious.  I see.  A cute, cuddly,  stuffed animal  with these big,  gnarly teeth.  Exactly.  What type of teeth  do you use?  Well, you can get  human teeth  out of cadavers.  And how do you 
[01:23:00]  fasten them on?  Well, wait,  how do you get  the teeth?  Well, no,  you buy them from...  All right,  but how do you  go about it?  Like, say,  I want to go  buy some teeth.  What do I do?  Do I go through  the yellow pages?  You call an  anatomical supply house.  There are several  in the country.  Oh, sure.  We had one of these  guys on,  if you remember.  Yeah.  Okay, go ahead.  And you call them up  and you tell them  what body part  you're looking for.  And you said teeth.  Well, in this case,  I needed teeth  or I've got  some dentist friends  who remove teeth 
[01:23:30]  from patients  and keep them  for me.  Ah.  All right, so...  So it's pretty easy  to get teeth.  But you didn't have  to explain to this guy  why you needed  the teeth?  No, no,  they never asked.  They never asked.  They assume that  you're going to use  them in some kind  of school environment.  So how many teeth  were in your order?  800.  Okay.  Well, you're going  to make a couple  of bunnies.  It was like 40  teeth per rabbit,  you know?  And what other  kind of teeth  are you using?  Because human teeth  don't look very 
[01:24:00]  vicious, does it?  No, they do  on a stuffed animal.  You get the gums  up and stuff.  Chuck, will you  send us one of these?  Yeah, I can get  one out to you.  And how do you  fasten them on?  Well, no,  you get fake gums,  you get an appliance  that they use  for like cadavers  and stuff like that.  Right, like some  kind of a denture thing?  Exactly.  And then you pop  those into this  into the thing.  A cuddly stuffed  animal.  This has got to  look great, though. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, they're beautiful.  They really are.  And then what do you  make it so they  look like they're  growling up on  the sides like a  dog growling so you  see the gums and  the teeth.  Sounds like you've  already seen it.  Do you have a picture  on a website or  anything?  No, no, I've got to  do that.  If you want to go  into business, all  you would have to do  is give out the  website address, if you  want to see a picture  of these rabbits, and  then you sell a million  of them.  That's what I need.  Yeah, I need more  trouble.  Now, a lot of people  want to know how to  get these rabbits.  You're not going to  screw our listeners,  right?  No, I never have yet.  Well, there was the 
[01:25:00]  phone sack.  You won't screw us.  They'll just sit there  and crank it.  You act like that's  the wrong thing to do.  All right, so how  can they get the  rabbits?  You can email me,  chuck69 at  AOL.com.  I'll dig out the  dwarf photos.  Okay.  Well, you've got to  send the photos so we  can put them up on  our websites.  We'll link you.  Now, do you use  fangs from things?  Yeah, there are  fangs on some of them.  Fangs on some of them.  Those have to look  good, man.  Those have to look  really cool with  them.  No, they're nice. 
[01:25:30]  They're nice, yeah.  Chuck, how did you  come up with this?  Well, I'm sitting  around.  Well, I've got a  jackalope in the  living room.  Yeah, the old  jackalope.  Yeah.  That old gag.  And...  It's a jackalope  with...  Are they not real?  Oh, are they not  real?  I remember being a  kid, and we were  driving out west, and  we'd stop at these  places out west, and  my father would be  like, hey, there's a  jackalope.  I just saw one running  across the street.  Did you see them?  Oh, they're all over  out here.  And you go in the  souvenir shops, and  they're hanging on the  wall.  They're jackrabbits, and 
[01:26:00]  they're stuffed.  And what they did was  they put the antlers on  them, so it looks like  these rabbits are  running around with  antlers.  So me and my brother  are like dopes, and  looking around for  jackalopes hopping around  outside.  Until you realize there's  no such thing as a  goddamn jackalope.  Mine looks great in the  living room.  They do look cool.  Chuck, any final  thoughts?  You gave us so much  today.  I don't know.  I'm just glad that the  baby slept through this  whole thing.  Yeah, I know.  It's scary to think that  you're a father, but...  Dad. 
[01:26:30]  My dad.  I thought he was  talking about his  date.  Is that what you're  calling the dwarf?  He could be.  So, yeah, you know,  like I said, I'm just  happy.  Little Paco slept  through this, and  you know.  Anything else coming  up in the future with  Chuck Farnham?  You know, I don't  think so.  Any new inventions?  I think, well, there's  the rabbits, and then  I think I'm straight to  the 4th of July.  Yeah.  Some kind of  explosive thing, I  think.  Of course.  What else?  You guys really need  to come out for a  visit. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, yeah, I'm there.  You can stay at the  house.  That's okay.  The serial killers  will be calling.  It'll be fun.  Name some of the  things that are in  your house again.  This is classic.  He collects  everything.  From here, I got, you  know that Discovery  Channel show?  Yeah.  With the Mastodon?  Yes.  I got some of the  hair off the Mastodon.  Come on.  Off of Woolly  Mammoth?  Yeah, I got it  right here.  How'd you get that?  I called those guys  up and begged.  And they said,  all right, then  they probably clipped  some of their pubes.  Here you go.  I got a piece of  Adolf Hitler's car. 
[01:27:30]  Hitler's car?  Yeah.  What piece?  It's part of the  seat.  The seat.  Oh, wow.  Where are you  sat?  I got part of the  beam from the,  that was holding up  the floor from the  seventh floor of the  Texas School Book  Depository.  How'd you get that?  I stole that.  You carved it out?  Yeah.  Okay.  They'll let you  wander around in there  if you look like  you're not, you know,  completely an idiot.  You look like an  idiot, pal.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  You know, I've got,  let's see, I've got  JFK, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe,  George Washington, and  Abraham Lincoln's hair.  Hair?  Really?  Hair.  How can you prove it's  their hair?  Well, I paid a lot of  money for it.  I assume that the  lineage is correct.  Okay.  Steak knives signed by  John Wayne Bobbitt here.  Cute.  You know, I'm just  looking around the  kitchen.  You should charge  admission to your  house.  I know.  Well, as I said, you 
[01:28:30]  guys could show up.  I think you would have  a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Like a museum.  Yeah, it's kind of  like a museum for the  retarded.  Right.  One of these days.  Yeah.  Stop by, you can spend  the weekend in the  trailer.  It's great.  All right, Chuck.  All right, kid.  Well, we'll call you  soon.  I'll be here.  So, Chuck69 at  AOL.com if you're  one of these rabbits with  the human teeth.  Yeah, or, you know,  anything else that I may  have, you know, body  parts that I may have  laying around.  I highly recommend the  cannibal jewelry myself.  Yeah?  Don't you need another  necklace?  Uh, yeah.  My necklace is now 
[01:29:00]  buried in the backyard.  But I had it for a while.  Really?  In darker, darker times.  Okay.  Well, maybe we'll get you  another one out there.  All right.  All right, buddy.  You should send one because  no one believes me.  Really?  And saw it for himself.  Yeah.  He's the only one around  here, though.  Oh, yeah.  The two of you were  definitely creeped out when  that came in the mail.  I remember the phone call.  Hell, yeah.  Hey, why don't you send us  a little care package and  we'll talk about it on the  air, okay?  Okay.  I've got your dad, by the  way.  He hasn't called me recently.  Dad?  Yeah.  Is that a gag?  No, he used to call me  all the time. 
[01:29:30]  Somebody saying he was  Opie's dad was calling you?  No, Opie's dad  definitely called me  like 20 times.  My dad did not call you.  He did, too.  He did not.  Don't you start with me.  He did, too.  He did not.  He did, too.  No, he didn't.  Proof.  He wrote me a letter, too,  and I've got a business  card here someplace.  I'll dig it up.  Oh, my God.  Sounds pretty familiar,  doesn't it, O?  I don't know.  Yeah.  We'll prove it off the air.  I wouldn't be surprised,  though.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:30:00]  All right, buddy.  Hold on, okay?  Sure, ma'am.  We're looking to go into  a partnership or something?  I don't know.  My dad's always got  something he's working on.  So I wouldn't be surprised.  Chuck, hold on.  We're going to give you  an address and send us  a care package.  All right, buddy.  All right.  There he goes, Chuck Farnham  from the left coast.  Send Stinky on a road trip  to this guy's house.  No, we like Stinky too much.  Yeah.  Although, if it was closer,  you'd be going.  Where does he live?  San Francisco area  or something like that?  I don't know.  Okay, we've got to take a break. 
[01:30:30]  Rick, yes, Rick?  We do have our next  ask and test it.  Nice.  She's outside.  Why are you smiling?  Because it's someone  that you guys know.  All right.  All right.  We'll get into that next.  Uh-oh.  Anthony,  I have an announcement  to make.  What?  Exactly 48 hours  from right now,  our musical chair game  will begin.  Musical dildo chairs. 
[01:31:00]  48 hours and counting.  This is great.  Someone has to make  a clock somewhere.  Clock.  Oh, okay.  I said clock.  I know I've had a cold  in the last few days,  but I didn't say clock.  We're getting the dildo.  Clock.  Clock.  Clock.  I thought you said  something else.  Okay.  All right.  And no,  my dad's not a dwarf,  Pete.  By the way,  don't miss the biggest event  in sports entertainment.  One unforgettable night,  WrestleMania 17. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, I thought you meant  musical dildo chairs.  Well, of course, Anthony.  48 hours and counting.  April 1st,  call your Cablevision  representative  to order the biggest  pay-per-view event  of the year.  Ask Contest continues next.  Boobs.  The world's  universal language.  Opie and Anthony,  your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay?  Hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by 
[01:32:00]  Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  We have someone  checking in from Ottawa,  Canada.  Syndication underground,  Anthony.  Canada.  Zedrick.  Another phrase  teen doesn't improve.  Teen dwarf sex.  Nah.  Although,  why not?  Amy, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  I just want to change  the name of your  musical chair game.  Less than 48 hours, 
[01:32:30]  by the way.  You sound like our DM.  Why?  I hear that.  I think it could be  musical dildos.  Oh, musical dildo chairs.  Musical dildos.  Nah, because that  sounds like a  singing dildo.  No, it sounds like  musical chairs with  dildos.  Well, you leave  the naming to us.  Yes.  Will do, boys.  Take care.  If someone comes up  with a better name,  we'll take it,  but that's not it, Amy.  All right, cool.  All right.  You just bring down  your veal flaps.  By the way,  all the ladies that said  they're in on this contest, 
[01:33:00]  we will be calling you  tomorrow to confirm.  Okay?  Dan from Hoboken  checking in.  Hey, what was that?  A dig on the sports guys?  You're such a whiner, Opie.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I check out the sports guys.  Sports guys!  One of two shows  I check out.  I tell them to you  any of them.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I should remind people  that Jeff from Survivor 2 
[01:33:30]  is checking in at 5.30,  I think.  Is he the gay guy?  I'm asking.  Sure.  Gotta ask.  How else  are you gonna find out?  Odds on favorite  that he's the gay guy.  It could be  the black guy, Nick,  or Mad Dog  that was kicked off, Ray,  but she swears she wasn't.  She's not gay.  Got kicked off, Maggie.  But supposedly,  one of the guys  from Survivor 2  admitted they were gay  on camera,  and they decided  to edit that out  of the program. 
[01:34:00]  Usually,  if someone's admitting  they're gay,  everyone knows anyway.  Everyone knows it.  So we'll see if he'll  answer that question today.  Yeah.  And we'll take your  questions for Jeff  from Survivor 2, okay?  Help us out with the interview.  We've done like five of these.  It's the same whole thing.  All right.  Best Ass Contest.  Continuing.  Our latest contestant  is outside the studio.  Girls.  We have a trip to  Vegas up for grabs.  Girls,  come on down.  That's all you gotta do.  Come on down here. 
[01:34:30]  We take a picture  of your ass.  It goes up on the website.  And we pick our finalists.  And then the listeners  vote for their favorite ass  to win the Best Ass Contest  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And then you win  a trip to Las Vegas.  Thank you,  Gear Magazine,  for the trip.  So it's easy.  And thank you,  Pinnacle Horned Goatweed,  for sponsoring  the Best Ass Contest.  It's open.  You don't have to call.  You don't have to do anything  but show up.  Let's bring in the...  Bring in our next contestant.  This is our third contestant. 
[01:35:00]  This is a little strange  because usually  when we're ready  to bring in a contestant,  everyone's all happy  and all sight  and jovial.  Yeah,  you know,  I thought this was  like a really good thing,  you know,  bring her in  and freak you guys out.  And then I just remembered  I gotta take the pictures.  All right,  bring her in.  Who saw this coming?  Oh my God.  Ah,  here we go.  You're a punishment  for abuse.  It's Patty.  Hello.  Hello, 
[01:35:30]  Patty.  Hello.  Patty,  you don't have  much teeth left,  man.  What's going on?  You're grinding  them down at night?  What are you...  I hope she's got  the chiclets.  I know.  What's happening  over there?  You grind your teeth  at night?  Sometimes.  And you're...  When I'm thinking  about the edge.  And your friend,  uh,  and your friend  Reynolds is in the studio.  Yes.  The one that can't  stand you  but won't say it  to your face.  What?  What happened?  Are you writing  her lines for her  today?  Yes.  You're a writer, 
[01:36:00]  right?  Yes,  I'm her writer today.  Yeah,  he writes for  10-10 wins.  10-10 wins.  It was 22 minutes  who gave me a headache.  That's great.  A little job  burn out there,  huh?  That must be  something.  Oh,  geez,  the same old  crap news  every day.  That's funny,  Reynolds.  We're still all  proud of their  Avianca picture  up in the lobby  of wins.  Remember that one  from 10 years ago,  whatever it was?  Yeah,  yeah.  Look,  we were there  first.  We won an award.  Yeah,  great. 
[01:36:30]  Reynolds,  do you have  anything to say  to Patty?  Good luck.  Good luck,  Patty.  Tell Patty  how you really  feel,  Reynolds.  I can't say  it on the radio.  Tell her what  you tell us  when we're  on the subway.  Oh,  no.  She's such  a nice girl.  You've been  friends for  how long,  Patty?  What,  25 years?  25 years.  She's been  pounding you.  That's what I  have to look  forward to?  It never ends.  It never ends. 
[01:37:00]  25 years  she'll be  following us  around.  Great.  You were  working at  wins 25 years  ago?  22.  22 years  ago?  So this  started where?  Where did it  say that again?  The relationship  with Patty.  Oh,  it started  in high  school.  Ah,  there you  go.  We were  in plays  and shows  together.  Yeah,  you did  plays?  She had  solos.  Yeah,  she had  solos.  Solo you  couldn't hear.  Oh.  That's  really good.  Now, 
[01:37:30]  Patty,  you were  in plays?  Yes,  I was.  And what  did you  do?  Give me  a play  that you  did.  That was  in Oliver.  I forgot  what I  played.  The maid  or something  with the  glass of water  that had  to throw  all over  somebody.  Something.  That's what  you do.  Look at  Reynolds and  look like,  oh,  Robert.  Reynolds,  come on.  So you  were in a  play.  We can help  you end  this relationship.  It's been  25 years.  How could  we help  him,  Opie,  when you  can't even  help yourself?  Yeah,  but it's  only been  like two  years. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah,  but you've  tried.  Look at  the guy.  25 years  of this.  It's been  25 years,  yeah,  you could  say that.  Easy.  Please,  could I  have some  more?  I need  more.  I'm  starving.  Patty,  why are  you entering  the best  ass contest?  Because  I think  I qualify.  All right,  Patty,  she's showing  some more  confidence  these days.  And my 
[01:38:30]  Bobo is  as good  as anyone  else.  A Bobo?  You call  it your  Bobo.  Yeah.  I see  new name  on the  Opie  message  board.  Bobo.  Harry  Bobo.  I don't  have  hair.  Harry  Bobo.  I do  do not  have  hair.  Bobo  fat  from  Star Wars.  Reynolds.  What  do you  call  her  ass?  I  call  it  there.  It's  there. 
[01:39:00]  She  has  one.  Patty,  you're  going to  take  down  your  drawers?  You  got  to be  in a  contest.  Well,  how else  are you  going to  look at  the  Bobo?  The  Bobo?  Why  do you  call  it  the  Bobo?  Because  it's  a nice  way  of  calling  it  other  than  the  donkey.  Right?  The  donkey.  The  hell's  going  on  back  there  that  you're  calling  it  the  donkey.  So,  Patty,  what other  plays  were you?  I'm  fascinated.  I was  in  Every Man  in  College.  You  were  in  Every Man 
[01:39:30]  in  College.  And  mostly  in  the  chorus.  Spin  that  around  and  have  fun  with  it,  people.  You  were  also  in  chorus.  So,  you're  a  singer.  Well,  yeah.  What  do you  sing?  What  do you  sing?  I  sang  in  talent  shows  with  the  guitar.  What  songs?  We  got  a  guitar?  God  damn.  Do you  know how  to play  guitar?  Yes,  I  do.  Get  a  guitar.  Go  get her  a  guitar.  Why  haven't  we  heard  Patty sing  before?  You'll  find out  in a  few  minutes.  Reynolds  is  very  cool,  man. 
[01:40:00]  What  songs  do  you  sing?  Give  us  some  titles.  Oh,  God,  I  remember  I  sang  Tammy.  I  remember  I  sang  You're  Adorable.  What  else  did  I  do?  What  are  these  songs?  I  never  heard  of  this.  If I  had  a  hammer,  anything,  you  wrote  a  song.  But  you  haven't  any  popular  songs  that  anyone  would  know  of?  She's  kind  of  stuck  in  time  in  another  place  too. 
[01:40:30]  Another  planet,  that's  right.  All  right,  we're  going to  get  the  electric  guitar.  Plug  in.  Plug  it in.  Steve,  we  plug  it  in?  I  don't  believe  that.  Can  you  play  an  electric  guitar?  If  I  hammer  in  the  morning,  hammer  in  the  evening,  all  over  this  land.  A  musical  guitar  that  I  play,  not  a  electric.  Whatever.  This  isn't  going to  be like  Dylan  going  electric.  I'm  used  to  Patty  unplugged.  It isn't  exactly  going to 
[01:41:00]  be  Randy  Rhodes  either,  although  he's  my  favorite  guitarist  of  all  time.  Great.  Aussie  fans  all  over  the  place  driving  off  the  road.  I  out  and  put  the  face  and  tell  the  bitch  to  keep  and  prepare  herself  for  her  first  skin.  Patty  doing  ghetto  boy.  We'll  try  anything  to  get  away  from  seeing  her  hairy  bobo.  I  don't  have  hair.  Ladies  make  your  man 
[01:41:30]  at  home.  Here,  crank up  that  PA.  It's  showtime  at the  Apollo.  That's a  little  lateral.  Nice.  We're  jamming.  Wait,  Steve.  You want  clean?  No,  I want  to hear  Steve  just  jam  for  a sec.  He  was  jamming  before.  Nice.  That's  some  feedback,  Patty.  Oh,  was that  Patty singing?  I couldn't  tell the  difference.  Never mind.  Never mind.  That was  a 
[01:42:00]  nice  game.  Yeah.  I don't  play like  that.  I play  acoustical.  Of course  you do.  Steve  plays  like  that.  Acoustical.  It's not  acoustic.  Put the  guitar on.  I haven't  played it.  I want  you to know.  I haven't  played it.  Whatever.  Rainy Rose is  one of your  favorites.  Let's hear a  little picking.  Strapping it  on.  There you go.  Put the  strap over  your  excuse for  shoulders.  It's Patty  rock.  Here she 
[01:42:30]  goes.  All right.  I haven't  touched the  guitar in  late  years.  You haven't  touched the  song either.  My name  is Patty.  I look  on the  second  floor.  I'm  upstairs  from you.  If I  borrow  food,  I'm  broke.  Patty,  put the  strap around.  It's like  around your  arm.  But I  haven't  touched the  guitar in  two years.  You know,  Patty,  if you turn  the lights  down just 
[01:43:00]  right and  you squint a  little bit,  you look just  like Lisa  Loeb.  I do not.  You're right,  you know.  I am  changing my  glasses in a  couple weeks.  Oh,  that'll make  all the  difference.  Thank you.  All right,  what are you  going to sing  for us,  Stalker Patty?  I don't know  what to say.  All right,  how about  some  something  you know?  Go ahead.  Listen,  you too. 
[01:43:30]  You know  any you  too?  You see,  I'm the  type that's  got to have  words in  front of me.  I can't  memorize them  in my life.  What do  you know  how to  sing?  Just play  anything you  know right  now and  sing us a  little tune.  We'll waste  some time,  Patty.  Come on,  sing us a  little tune.  Go ahead.  Oh,  that's  attractive.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Making you  stay all the  year.  It's the 
[01:44:00]  Beatle.  No,  no,  go,  go.  You're  doing great.  I was  enjoying that.  You're  doing great.  Come on,  Patty.  Patty,  you were  doing good.  Let's  go.  From the  top.  All right.  Oh.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Making you  stay all the  year.  I don't even  remember the  tone.  Oh,  you could do  it.  This is so 
[01:44:30]  good.  Hello,  John Lennon here  from the grave.  I'm spinning so  fast,  can somebody put  a little oil in  me casket before  I burn up?  One more try.  Maybe try another  song.  Another song.  You know a lot  of Beatles.  Come on.  Play us some  Beatles.  I'm trying to  think.  That's tough  enough right  there.  I'm getting a  flashback to  Ziggy myself. 
[01:45:00]  Here she  goes.  You know  Rocky  Raccoon or  anything?  No?  Raccoon.  Raccoon to  his  son.  He's only  cute.  If I  look at  all  of us  like a  little  man,  Chris with a  gun,  he'll shoot on  the legs of  his rival. 
[01:45:30]  His rival,  it seems,  have broken  his dreams  of stealing  the girl  of his fancy.  Steve,  what's going  on?  Hey,  guys.  Hey.  I'm Mavis  McGill and  I'm starving  and can't  pay the rent.  Hey,  Patty.  Patty.  I'm so  embarrassed.  Oh,  poor Patty.  Oh,  Steve,  I was  wondering what  your stance  on Napster  is.  There's  nothing wrong  with Napster.  People don't  mind us  with coffee  there,  Scott.  I will 
[01:46:00]  die if  Scott  Patty ends  up on  Napster.  That'll  be great.  Of course,  PSM  support.  Thanks.  Patty,  loosen up.  Give us  one more  try because  I really  want to  get a  song out  of you  here.  It's  either  that  or  we  got to  check  out  the  bobo.  Yeah.  It's  off.  Hey,  who  turned  the  guitar  off?  That's  too  bad.  It's  refusing  to be  played  by her.  It's  got  like  a  breaker  in  it.  Oh,  is  there  something  down  there?  There  you  go.  One  song.  That's  nice. 
[01:46:30]  I'll  go  50s.  All  right.  Fine.  Anything.  Go  50s.  Those  are  easy  to  remember.  It's  just  like  heaven  being  here  with  you.  You're  like  an  angel  to  good  to  be  true.  But  after  all  I  love  you  as  you. 
[01:47:00]  Angel  baby,  my  angel  baby,  it's  just  like  heaven  being  here  with  you.  You're  like  an  angel  to  good  to  be  true.  But  that's  the  world  is  like  you  as  you. 
[01:47:30]  Let's  you  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby.  Ooh,  ooh,  ooh,  ooh,  what's  you.  Oh,  let's  charge it!  Let's  charge it!  What?  Oh,  baby!  Baby!  I  made  an  idiot.  It's 
[01:48:00]  a  cat  fat.  Uh,  Jim  Norton.  Patty.  Patty?  Patty,  do you  hear Jim?  No.  Can you  hear me?  Can you  hear Jim,  Patty?  All right.  You sing  like Dave  Ruth two  days before  he died.  It wasn't  actually bad.  Um,  your voice  kind of 
[01:48:30]  flows like  a diuretic  evacuation of  a leukemia  patient.  He's a  comedian.  I  actually  liked it,  though.  You did  a night,  do you  know a  song called  song?  Can you  sing it?  Wow!  Oh, my God,  Norton.  You got to jump  out of that.  Oh, you got to jump  you can't say that?  No, you can't use a C  word like that.  Even I know that.  Jesus, that is  great.  Keep up the good  work, Patty.  I just wanted to  say hello.  Oh, Jim, you're  the best. 
[01:49:00]  Hi, Jim.  Jim, you're  the best.  Dan from  Hoboken, the  real day the  music died,  March 14,  2001.  No, I  really can sing,  but when I'm  nervous, I have  nothing to do.  Of course, of  course, we  have to stay.  Can we see  your bobo?  All right, here  we go.  Patty entering  the best  ass contest.  Why is  people, who's  screaming outside  the studio?  Earl.  Earl.  Good job, 
[01:49:30]  Patty.  Playing and  singing.  I haven't  touched the  guitar in two  years.  Two years?  It was obvious,  but I'm just  kidding.  She did okay,  right?  Good job.  Time for the  unveiling.  All right, yeah,  Patty, weren't you,  I never thought I'd  say this, but  Patty, why don't  you get naked?  In the meantime,  yes?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:50:00]  Hello?  Hi.  Who's this?  Marion, how  you doing?  Son of a bitch.  Hi, Opie,  hi, Anthony,  how you been?  Hi, you babbling  idiot.  Hey.  You better watch  you better watch  you, I'm your  kids just against  you.  You look so good.  Huh?  She sounds really  good.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  She does.  All right. 
[01:50:30]  Give her credit,  guys.  She's up there,  and she sounds  really good.  Virgin.  And it's good that  she's entering the  best ass contest.  Hey, I would come  up and enter.  Oh, no, that's  okay.  Hey, you want me  to lady, Diana,  come up and enter?  No, that's all  right.  Why not?  Hey, Marion.  What?  Get lost.  Hey, that ain't  nice, Opie.  What?  And we're going  to be up.  Yeah, thank you,  Opie.  We're going to be  up to the first.  All right, Patty,  what are you doing?  Okay, what do you  want me to do?  Why is everyone  moving close to  me, man? 
[01:51:00]  Best ass contest,  I guess by the  CD wall?  Oh, God.  Oh, look at that.  You're not wearing  a bra again today.  Right over there.  What a treat.  All right, now  you've got to  turn around.  All right.  Whoa, you got  the...  happening.  What?  Rich Voss, come  on in here.  Whoa, that guitar  almost suffered the  second worst fate it  ever had.  It almost just fell.  Hey, Rich Voss  entering the studio  with Dave. 
[01:51:30]  What's up, man?  From the real  world.  Real world L.A.,  baby.  What's up, man?  You troublemaker.  What's up?  Dave.  What's happening,  guys?  Good boy.  You got a bum  deal on that  damn show.  I know, man.  Freakiotomy patients  sound better than  her.  All right.  Are you guys  going to take  the booty picture  now?  Yeah, here we  go.  She calls it  the Bobo.  Hey, Patty,  why don't you  flash Dave real  fast?  Oh, Lord.  He's never seen  your horrific  boobs.  Oh, Lord.  Just show him.  Watch this, Dave.  There you go. 
[01:52:00]  Kellogg's  raising brain.  Toops,  toops.  Let me see  them again.  I didn't get  to see them.  Small is not  probably.  And she's had  the hair removed.  She had hair  on there?  Oh, yeah.  We had to get  the hair removed.  She's feeling  very sexy these  days, and now  she's going to  show us around.  And they kicked me  off just for  pulling a blanket.  I mean, what is  this world coming  to?  You get a  lunchbox with  those boobs?  Lunchbox,  you know.  Get it?  Lunchbox,  kid?  All right.  Let's start off  on a good note.  You know,  lunchbox.  What's  happening to 
[01:52:30]  y'all?  Well, we  got to get...  All right,  go ahead,  Patty.  Patty, let  her rip.  All right,  Patty, let's  see that...  Come on,  baby!  Here we go.  Patty entering  the...  They're coming  down.  Oh, God!  Look at the  under...  Wait a minute,  we need to  take a picture.  No, what?  No, no, no.  What?  No, what?  What's the  matter, Opie?  What?  That's your...  That's Patty's  ass.  Patty.  At least it's  bigger than it.  Patty, Patty.  Put the pants down.  Patty, get back  to the microphone. 
[01:53:00]  What kind of  underwear are those?  That's what I  want to explain  on the radio.  Like servant  panties?  We didn't expect  you to have a  thong on.  Thong, thong,  thong, thong.  What?  How can you  see the bobo  otherwise?  If she's not  wearing a thong...  Where do you  get that thong  from?  I bought it  at the store.  What store?  In the mall.  Secondhand shop.  Satin Island  mall.  I go do  one for a  while. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Cisco's donating  all the proceeds  from the thong  song to a  charity.  After that  one.  Oh my  There we  go.  All right,  Patty,  back up  against the  wall.  Rick,  get ready  to take  this picture  because she  wants to  enter.  Who are we  to say who  can or can't  get into the  ass contest? 
[01:54:00]  She is wearing  a little floral  pattern thong,  Opie.  Patty,  you've got to  whip those  down.  You've got to  pull it down.  It's going to  make your ass  look worse  because you're  holding it up  and it's  making...  No,  no,  you've got to  pull your  pants down  more.  Damn it!  Wipe the  bug off.  Wipe the  bug off.  Pants down,  Patty.  Yeah,  there you go.  Just hold that  pose.  Hold that  pose.  Rick,  take some  shots.  Take some  shots.  What are the  scratches,  Patty?  What's been  going on?  It's like  looking into  Medusa's 
[01:54:30]  face,  isn't it?  Patty's  going like  a...  Oh,  God.  Okay.  Okay.  No,  no,  Rick.  Rick,  trying to  put her in  seductive,  sexy poses  is not going  to help  in this case.  There you  go.  Oh,  God.  Wow.  Patty,  do you have  like a cat  or something?  You have  scratches.  You've got  scratches on  your ass,  Patty.  How could  it tell?  That's  nice. 
[01:55:00]  Nice.  Right,  Oak?  That's  Braille for  nasty.  Yeah,  you see  all the  from jumping  the turnstiles.  Looks like  she was  sitting in  a thong  in a  gravel  driveway.  Wow.  I think  I saw  her on  the  Geraldo  Rivera  special  from  years  back,  Anthony.  Willow  Brooke.  I love  New York.  Look,  there's got  to be  something  illegal  about this,  I'm  telling you.  This is  like a  bullet wound.  Did  Puffy  shoot you  in your  butt?  What  happened  there, 
[01:55:30]  Pat?  Are you  going to  shoot you  out in  Club  New York?  What's  up with  the  scratches?  Yeah,  what's  going on  with those  scratches on  your butt?  I have  a pair of  pants.  Get on  the  mic.  I  had a  pair of  pants that  had something  like a belt  on it or  something and  it hit my  skin by  mistake.  By  mistake.  These are  an armor  suit.  What kind  of pants?  It had  like a belt  and I  didn't realize  the pointy  thing was  standing and  I pulled  them up  really fast.  Kurt wants 
[01:56:00]  to know if  you have any  butterscotch  happening.  No,  I don't.  Can we  check for  butterscotch?  No,  I don't.  Can we  have eight  guys have  sex with  you on a  pinball  machine?  I feel  that's where  this is  leading.  On a  pinball  machine?  Yeah,  no,  how about  a pool  table?  A pool  table,  no.  I feel  like I  got a  yeast  infection  just  looking at  you.  Patty is  a virgin  by the  way.  She's a  virgin.  How old  is that?  45-year-old  virgin.  45-year-old  virgin. 
[01:56:30]  There's  nothing wrong  with that.  Of course  not.  I'm waiting  for the  right man.  He's on  Venus.  That  explains  the  scratches.  He's  got that  chassis  build  off.  Yeah.  I don't  wear one.  Don't  need it.  Hello,  yes?  Yes,  hi,  how are you  doing?  It's  Lady Di.  How's  everything?  Patty,  you sounded  really good  on the  radio.  Right,  this woman.  That's  like comparing  all the  scrapples.  Shut up.  Listen to  me.  I looked  at that  ass and  I thought  Hud 
[01:57:00]  was  going  to  come  forward.  Patty,  you  sounded  really good.  You should  advertise the  new turkey  spam.  What?  Excuse me?  Lady Di,  what?  Hello?  Yeah,  what?  I'm not  entering any  contest.  I just  want to  let Patty  know.  asking you.  I know  that.  We're  begging you.  Come on  down.  No,  that's  all right.  I'm not  entering  any  contest.  I just  want to  let Patty  know that  she's  doing  really  good.  Thank  you,  Opie.  Thank  you.  From one  psychopath  to the  other.  Listen  to me.  I  had  something  to say  and now 
[01:57:30]  I  forgot.  But  it's  going to  come  back  to  me  and  it's  going  to  be  good.  What  was it?  Did  a Navy  sub  come up  underneath  a little  dented.  Let me  tell you,  I don't  think for  my age  I'm  bad at  all.  You  were in  that  Kuwaiti  accident  yesterday  where they  dropped  the bomb.  There's  no mileage  on that  thing.  I  know.  No  mileage.  None.  That  ass has  never been  ridden.  Never  been 
[01:58:00]  used.  That's  it.  It's  only seen  toilet  seats.  We'll  taste  reality  for you  people,  okay?  That's  it.  Well,  Patty,  your pictures  are taken.  They'll  go up on  the  website and  say I  think we  have a  finalist  even as  a joke.  We've  got to  airbrush  the  scratches  for  us.  You  know  what's  scary?  She's  contestant  number  three,  which  gives  her a  33%  chance  of  winning  this  contest.  Patty,  you've  changed.  I haven't 
[01:58:30]  been on  vacation  in 10  years.  You've  changed,  Patty.  You're  getting a  little  more  open  with  your  womanhood  there.  You  get  your  hair  done  now.  Can  we  see  your  bikini  waxing?  My  bikini  waxing?  I never  got my  bikini  waxing.  Didn't  you get  waxed  down  there?  No.  We  had her  do  the  bikini  line  with  the  hair  removal.  No,  they  didn't  shave  you  on  there?  They  just  basically  did  my  booby  comms.  Can  we  smash  you  in  the  head  with  a  pool  cube?  Are  you  12  years  old?  My 
[01:59:00]  booby  comms?  Booby  comms and  Bobo.  I got  laid.  my  booby  comms.  Here's  my  goofy  and  my  Patty  can we  see  the  patch  or  what?  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Patch!  Oh,  you're very  naughty.  Yes,  very naughty.  Your  dear. 
[01:59:30]  Come on,  Patty.  My  goodness.  Let's  see your  stuff.  This  is  the  real  world.  Yeah,  right  here.  Come on.  We'll  call it  the  patootie?  The  patootie?  The  rudy.  I  thought  the  bobo  was  the  patootie?  No,  the  bobo  was  the  back.  And  that's  a  patootie  up  front?  Patty,  why don't  you  get in  the  corner  and  just  give  us  a  quick  patch  flash?  Why don't  you  just  go put  some  orange  marker  on it  and  let's  see  bozo.  Come on.  A  little  patch  flash,  Opie?  No,  I can't.  Why,  I got to  see  Lawrence  Taylor's 
[02:00:00]  S&C.  You're  lucky Jim  Norton  was here.  You'd be  up on  the  tape deck  right now.  Oh,  really?  Well,  Jim  Norton  felt her  up.  Jim,  don't  play.  Jim  Norton  felt her  up.  That was  the first  type of  sex  you  ever  had.  He'll  do  it  to  your  armpits.  Yeah.  With  his  glasses  on.  Against  your  will,  or  you  can  do  it  on  your  own,  Patty.  What  will  it  be?  You  show  it.  I'm  going  smash  you  with  a  heavy  object.  I know.  All right,  Patty,  why don't you 
[02:00:30]  leave?  Can we borrow  the intern's  patch that  lied last  week and  put it  across the  butt?  That's the  real accident  right there.  The  Rudy  patootie.  Last  time I  saw  something  like  that,  it  had  that  crime  scene  tape  around  it.  That  should  just  not  be  out  there  for  people  to  just  wander  into.  You  try  to  put  the  tape  up.  Have  the  cop  there  to  send  people  away.  Looks 
[02:01:00]  like  veal.  New  turkey  spam.  All  right.  Well,  we want  to thank  Patty  for  singing  a song  and  entering  the  best  ass  contest.  That  was  pretty  nice,  Patty.  Thank  you.  You  guys  know  Patty  knows  the  new  coach  to  the  door,  right?  We  just  got  those  new  coach.  Patty,  after  all  this,  how  are you  going to  when  you  go  back  to  Covenant  House,  they  all  know  Covenant  House. 
[02:01:30]  Don't  worry.  Yeah,  the old  Covenant  House.  Remember  that?  With  Father  Ritter?  Yeah.  He had  a glory  hole  in his  confession  booth.  Who  doesn't?  You  know,  I think  Puffy  should be  put on  house  arrest  and let  her walk  around  with  the  thongs.  That's  a good  thing.  Come  on,  what  did  he  do?  He  didn't  actually  kill  anyone.  Lighten  up on  the  poor  guy.  50  years  of  that.  Where  do you  buy  your  thongs,  Patty?  I  go to  the  mall.  The  mall?  Yeah? 
[02:02:00]  What  store  in  the  mall?  I  don't  know,  G&G's  and  stuff  like  that.  I  go to  all  the  little  shops.  Do you  get a  little  funky  there with  the  Victoria  Secret  stuff?  Well,  I  can't  afford  to  go to  Victoria  Secret.  Ah,  we  can  tell.  There  are  reasons  Victoria  Marshalls.  It's  the reason  they call  it a  secret,  too.  They  don't want  everyone  wearing it.  I  was 
[02:02:30]  changing  my  grandmother.  Yeah,  do they  have  Velcro  strips  on the  side,  Patty?  Yeah,  they were  hard to  get off  to.  I  scratched  her.  Great  job,  though,  Patty.  You know,  when we  first had  her come  on the  show,  there's  no way  she  ever  would  have  done  this.  I  think  she's  feeling  a lot  more  confident  about  herself,  right?  Yeah,  I think  it's  the  middle  age  crisis.  I  think  you're  going  to  give  it  up.  I  think  you're  going  to  give  up  that  patch  sometimes.  Someone  I 
[02:03:00]  care  about.  I  don't  use  people.  I  think  she  should  do  the  musical  chair.  It's  going to  be a  hot  thing.  There's  a guy  out  front  with a  sign  that  says  we'll  work  for  spam.  What  do  you  say?  Is  he  the  right  guy?  Who's  the  right  guy,  Patty?  You've  been  waiting  this  long.  You're  going  to  find  him?  Someone  that I  care  about,  I guess.  Care  about?  You're  putting  too  much  into  it.  How  does  somebody  just  buy  a  new  pair  underwear?  Would  they  qualify?  Yeah,  I don't  get to  meet  too  many  people  very 
[02:03:30]  much.  How  do  you  wash  your  underwear?  Do  you  wash  them  in  the  machine  and  hand  scribble?  Rennell,  throw  her  one,  man.  Throw  her  a  banging.  For  God's  sake.  Oh,  no.  Very  good.  A  big  black  buck  like  you?  Come  on.  Very  good.  You  don't  eat  spam?  Boss  the 
[02:04:00]  Greek.  You  don't  want  no  new  turkey  spam?  Thanks  for  the  compliment.  All  listen,  we  got  to  take  a  break  because  we  are  going  to  talk  to  Jeff  from  Survivor.  All  right,  Survivor  Australia  in just  a minute  here.  We  survived  something.  Patty,  thanks,  I  think.  Good  job,  Patty.  Reynolds,  thanks.  10-10  wins.  Make  sure  traffic  ends  up  on  the  ones  because  I  get  confused.  Sometimes  it's  on  a  two  and  I  freak  out.  Lose  my  mind  and  never  early.  Good  job.  Jeff  from  Survivor 
[02:04:30]  2,  Australian  outback  in.  Up  next.  Now  that's  romantic.  Anheuser-Busch,  St. Louis,  Missouri.  Attention Survivor  fans.  Don't miss  an all-new  episode of  Survivor,  the Australian  outback  on a special  night.  Tonight,  all-new  Survivor,  CBS  Tonight.  Whip-em-out  Wednesday.  What is that?  Like some  kind of guy 
[02:05:00]  name?  Like some  kind of  sexist  guy  name?  Yeah!  You will  not get  away with  it!  I wish  you could  just shut  your face  up!  It's  Whip-em-out  Wednesday!  What about  that?  Obi and  Anthony,  N-E-W.  Anthony,  speaking of  Survivor,  yes,  on the  phone,  Jeff  Varner,  Jeff,  yeah,  who got  kicked off  last week,  yeah, 
[02:05:30]  hey Jeff,  how are you?  I'm doing  good,  how are you  doing?  Welcome to  the Obi and  Anthony  show.  I think  I'm happy  to be  here.  Uh-oh.  Why are  all you guys  scared to  come on  our radio  show?  I'm not  afraid of  you,  man,  I love  you guys.  If I  were there,  I'd whip  it out  for you.  Uh-oh.  You're a  New York  guy.  I am.  Jeff,  I'm kind  of mad  at you.  Why?  I had  you to  win the  whole  thing.  Well,  it ain't  my fault.  Be  mad at  Kimmy.  Yeah,  you were  saying that  on another  interview that  Kimmy kind  of ruined  it for  you.  How did  she wreck  it? 
[02:06:00]  Well,  Jeff,  we'll  explain.  How did  Kimmy,  who's a  fan of  this show,  by the  way,  ruin it?  She  screwed  me without  a kiss,  dude.  Kimmy told  the other  team I  had that  vote against  me.  So they  knew to  send that  vote my  way.  They knew  that if  it was a  tie that  they were  going to  vote for  me,  and they  figured that  out on  the fourth  day.  There was  nothing I  could do  about it.  Wow,  they were  playing the  game on  you.  Yeah.  You got  effed.  Yeah,  last week  when you  got voted  off,  I was  really  surprised  because I  had you  to go  the distance.  Yeah,  and you  know what,  if that  hadn't  happened,  I  probably  would have. 
[02:06:30]  I had  it set  up.  You  think so?  I know  so.  I know  so.  Now,  Jeff,  I got  to ask  you  something.  All  right.  I was  reading  some  tabloids.  You  read that  junk?  Yeah,  it's the  best  junk out  there.  Screw  the  regular  papers.  Unless  it's  got a  bunch  of  colors  in  it  and  colored  pictures  all  through  the  middle.  I  don't  bother.  All  right.  Can  I  say  you  what  I  read?  I  don't  care.  There's  someone  who's  gay  on the  show. 
[02:07:00]  And  they  said  it's  either  you,  Mad Dog,  or  Nick.  Wow.  And  the  only  reason  I  bring  it  up  is  because  they  said  this  person  also  out of  themselves  on  the  show  but  the  survivor  decided  to  edit  it  out.  Wow.  Why'd  they  do  that?  I  don't  know  about  that.  I  don't  know  about  that.  Now Nick  and I  live  together  over  at  Kucha  so  I  can  tell  you  right  now  nobody  on  my  beach  came  out  on  anybody's  camera.  Nobody.  Well I  didn't mean  they came  out in 
[02:07:30]  that way  they just  kind of  confessed  that  you know  they're  well you  know  what I  mean.  Yeah.  It's  okay to  be  gay  on  Survivor.  Hey  the  last  guy  won.  Yeah  right.  What  the  hell?  You're  not  going  to  fess  up  to  that.  Who  listened  to  Judy  Garland  albums  on  the  island?  Yeah  they're  one  luxury  item.  What  Judy  Garland  Al?  Victor  and  Judy  Garland  That's  the  difference  from  the  real  world 
[02:08:00]  Survivor.  Almost  everybody  on  the  real  world  is  gay  now.  Is  that  what  it  is?  Yeah  almost  everybody.  Hey  Jeff  did  you  watch  real  world  Los  Angeles?  No.  Oh  okay.  I  was  the  first  brother  that  got  kicked  off  so I  started  the  whole  kicked  off  phenomenon.  Yeah  he  was  the  black  guy  that  got  kicked  off  of  real  world  Los  Angeles.  We  was  the  first  reality  based  television  show  so  they  made  it  attractive  to be  kicked  off.  I'm  responsible  so you're  cool man.  Oh man  I know  who you  are.  You ripped  that blanket  off that  shit.  So you  know I  ain't gay.  Woo! 
[02:08:30]  You go  for it  dude.  I  liked  you.  I  thought  that  was  pretty  cool.  Hey  I  like  you  too  brother.  He  was  kicked  off  he  got  caught  stealing  out  of  the  house.  He  got a  bum  rap  that  kicked  him  out  for  that.  Yeah  I  remember  watching  that  and  thinking  you  know  she  was  liking  that.  She  was  laughing  and  everything.  She  got  all  drama  queen  on  her.  If  this  was  survivor  I  would  have  fed  it  to  the  crocodile. 
[02:09:00]  What  was  her name  Tammie  right?  Tammie  yeah.  I  pulled  the  blankets  off  and  saw  her  wild  out  back.  There  was  nothing  to  look  at  there.  Talk  about  the  butt.  It  was  better  than  Patty's  butt.  I  tell  you  that.  Yeah  wow.  Not  saying  much.  New  turkey  spams.  Hey  guys  why  did  Kel  hang  up  on  you?  Oh  you  want  to  get  into  that?  Everyone  likes  talking  about  that.  We  don't  have  to  get  into  it  but  that's  something  I  wanted  to  ask  you.  Well  we  asked  all  you  guys  was  Kel  masturbating 
[02:09:30]  in  the  bush  or  not?  I  was.  I  don't  know  about  Kel.  There  you  go.  So  you'll  admit  that  you  were  pleasuring  yourself.  I  did  it  once  and  I  did  it  for  the  sole  purpose  of  being  able  to  say  I  did  it  and  I  ain't  ashamed  of  they  got  it  on  film  and  so  we  asked  Kel  about  it  and  he  denied  it  and  we  just  kept  pushing  and  pushing 
[02:10:00]  until  he  hung  up  on  us.  He  got  upset  because  everything  we  were  talking  about  had  to do  with  masturbation  and  we  wouldn't let  the word  in  edgewise  about  anything  else.  What a  freak  man.  That's  all I  want  to  talk  about.  Why  is  the bush  throwing  yogurt  at  me?  Mommy  what's  wrong  with  this  bush?  Now  Jeff  you  prepared  for  this  little  adventure  by  gaining  weight.  Yeah  I  did.  I  didn't  think  I'd  be  eating  for  42  days  and  I  planned  on  being  there  every  damn  one  of  them  so  I  picked 
[02:10:30]  out  and  I  loved  it  man  there's  nothing  better  than  power  eating.  I  also  heard  you  built  a  little  shelter  in  your  backyard  or  something  I  actually  I  was  down  in  North  Carolina  and  I  went  out  in  the  forest  back  behind  the  house  and  chopped  down  some  logs  I  mean  I  did  it  right  I  got  bought  some  rope  and  built  a  nice  little  lean  to  and  slept  in  it  one  night  yeah  you  did  I  sure  did  why  I  was  ready  for  that  because  I  wanted  to at least  know  what  I 
[02:11:00]  killed  the  pig  and  caught  the  fish  they  didn't  give  us  anything  except  they  gave  you  the  wine  and  cheese  that 's  a  merger  thing  you  know  but  then  you  were  on  the  pylon  for  a  total  of  a  minute  last  week  and  then  all  sudden  you  were  chowing  down  on  the  apples  and  the  peanut  butter  actually  it  was  45  seconds  yeah

[02:14:00]  I went  on the  floor  I was  totally  going to  embrace  his  whole  little  loser  concept  I love  that he  screws  us  the way  he does  yeah  and they  just  freaked  out  man  they  wanted  me  to  stand  in  that  corner  and  keep  my  mouth  shut  and  act  stupid  so  we  wouldn't  intimidate  Dave  he's  got that  staff  beat down  so bad  it's  pathetic  that  fellow  was  terrified  of  David  Letterman  terrified  why  do they  have  you  stand  where  they  do  why  can't  you  sit  on  the  couch  for  a few  minutes  I  don't  know  but  you  know  what  if  there  are  any  other  survivors  out  there  that 
[02:14:30]  even  better  you  were  on  Regis  the  other  morning  I  guess  yeah  I  was  and  it's  so  funny  because  Regis  has  no  clue  about  this  show  he  has  no  idea  what  the  show  is  about  why  you're  even  sitting  there  he  has  no  concept  of  what  is  going  on  he  just  sat  there  sort  of  stone  faced  but  I  didn't  care  because  I  was  into  Kelly  Ripa  anyway  she's  looking  hot  that's

[02:15:30]  hope  take  it  easy  Jeff  Warner  from  Survivor  the  Australian  Outback  let me  tell you  that guy  was good  on  Letterman  he wasn't  putting up  with it  he wasn't  intimidated  let me tell you  something  if I  went out  as a guest  and they  made me  stand in  a corner  you have  to come  back  at him  you go  on  Letterman  crawling  and do  head spins  who's  getting  over  Letterman's  calling  screw him  if I  don't get  on that  chair  I want  to be  first guest  I got to be 
[02:16:00]  in the corner  with a diaper  on  sucking my  thumb  I'm there  like his  relationship  so good  with Leno  that he's  able to  bash  Letterman  listen to this  guy  he'll go in there  with Patty  Thongs on  Joe Franklin  wasn't calling  wasn't calling  you  Rich  hey good  one  bravo  Rick  some insight  to the  Letterman thing  yes  the thing is  Letterman hates  survivors  he hates reality  shows and he  hates the fact that  CBS forces him to 
[02:16:30]  take them as a  guest every week  so just to  stick it into  these guys all  have a story  it's interesting  it's a ton of  people are  interesting enough  to tune in  Letterman just to  check it out  he just thinks it's  stupid so to  stick it to CBS  he puts him as  far away as he  can and get up  against the wall  and makes him  stand there  that's so  disappointing  because Letterman  he used to be  one of my heroes  but he just  doesn't get it  at any point  you know what's  happening now  there's a big  strike coming  in Hollywood  and a lot of  actors are still  angry at all these  reality based  television shows
