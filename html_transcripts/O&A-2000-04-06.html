<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between segments.  It began with discussions about Anthony's upcoming No Doubt concert, filled with humorous speculation about his potential interactions with Gwen Stefani, followed by Opie's contrasting experiences: attending his grandmother's 90th birthday party but skipping a Ricky Martin concert with his girlfriend, Sandy. This led to self-deprecating jokes about their precarious employment situation, likening themselves to "crack addicts" due to their repeated near-firings for controversial on-air content.

A caller, Jennifer, shared erotic dreams involving both Opie and Anthony, prompting a sexually suggestive game of "What's in My Pants."  The show also touched upon their rivalry with other radio stations (Z100, PLJ),  an upcoming appearance by Stephen Lynch, and the ongoing "Most Offensive Song Contest," featuring an inflammatory entry from Anthony's brother.  A Daily News article about the show was mentioned, along with a fight between Jay Moore and another individual. Psycho Mark was present in the studio during at least part of the broadcast.

A discussion about journalistic style and the use of last names segued into a bizarre anecdote from Spaz, the show's producer, claiming to have been urinated on from a great height.  This prompted prolonged comedic mockery from the hosts, who explored various explanations while Spaz maintained his account, promising further details in his "Spaz's Week in Review" segment.  A phone-in segment about the Elian Gonz√°lez case was interspersed with further jokes about Spaz's urination story, even featuring a humorous news report parody.

Stephen Lynch appeared as a scheduled guest, recounting a story about an encounter with Jay Moore. Audio clips of a fight between Jay Moore and another individual were played.  The show also featured a discussion of a confrontation between Jay Moore, Paul, and Billy from Airsick.net, stemming from a perceived slight during a previous show. This led to a heated exchange escalating to near physical violence, recounted with amusement by the hosts.  Accusations of Jay Moore stealing material, including specific examples like "whale's eye" and "pimp hand," were made.  Lynch performed several songs, including a highly offensive parody of John Lennon's "Imagine" containing extreme racial slurs and derogatory language. Listener calls offering suggestions for the "perfect woman" were also included.  Audio of the studio altercation between Jay Moore, Paul, and Billy was played extensively.

A significant portion of the show involved a heated confrontation between Opie, Anthony, and Jay Moore, escalating to the point of threatened physical violence requiring intervention. This argument centered on grievances between Moore and the hosts, including accusations of "backpedaling," being a "phony," and stealing material. Moore complained about a lack of reciprocal promotional efforts and unfair attacks. Anthony's brother, Joe, intervened.  The segment included listener calls, and several other individuals participated, including Billy, Paul, Rick, Dina Kola, and Steven Lynch.  A particularly offensive song from the "most offensive song contest" was discussed and played. Video footage of the altercation, available on foundrymusic.com, was referenced. The hosts continued discussing the event and its aftermath, with callers sharing their experiences.  Finally, several sponsors, including Paisano's and Rockaway Bedding, were promoted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stock and girls playing What's In My Pair?  Yeah, Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up?  You're enjoying the musical stylings of Chord.  Yes. 
[00:00:30]  I heard the show over the weekend was off the hook.  Off the hook?  Off the hook, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  Yo.  Of course, Korn's playing this weekend as well.  Yeah, that's what the kids are saying these days.  Off the hook, yo.  Like we're so old.  I'm hearing rumors, too.  Korn did an interview recently, Anthony?  Yeah.  Uh, they're going to be touring with Metallica and Kid Rock this summer. 
[00:01:00]  However, that bill remains unconfirmed.  Oh, that would be an unbelievable show.  Korn, Metallica, and Kid Rock?  Mm-hmm.  I do believe someone would, uh, die at a show like that.  Yes.  Not bad.  What?  Nothing, that show.  All right.  All right.  That's funny.  Hey!  Ha, ha.  Hey, you've just been ripping off my eyes. 
[00:01:30]  I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise.  Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?  This world is forcing me to hook your hands.  Oh, shit, you do.  I need a bottle of me.  Yeah.  Are you going to be dressing up like Gwen Stefani tonight, Anthony, for the show?  Well, don't I always when I go to my down?  I dress up like Gwen.  I see you got your hair dyed pink for the show tonight.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:02:00]  You see that, I'm sure, right in front of your face.  That's what I'm seeing.  That's right.  It might have been the blotter ass that I did before the show, but it looks like you  got pink hair and a pink goatee right now.  I dress like Gwen.  For the No Doubt show tonight.  For Gwen.  And I stand right in front, and I gawk at her and try to get her attention.  And I dream of the day where I may be able to go home with Gwen Stefani and chop her  into little pieces, and bury her in the yard with the other dirty girl. 
[00:02:30]  So, Gwen, tonight when you're at the No Doubt show, what's the move when this song comes  on?  Are you just going to be like, what are you, a tool?  What's the move, though?  Or do you just kind of nod to the stage like, yeah, all right, I know this one.  You know the deal when your favorite song comes on when you go to a show?  No, I think I rip my clothes off and try to sexually assault Gwen Stefani during this 
[00:03:00]  song.  That's what it is.  That's the move, right?  That's the move.  I rush this stage and try to get through the bouncers and try to rip her clothes off.  Yeah, that's it.  You got me.  I'm going to No Doubt.  Right.  Tonight.  Should be a lot of fun.  Over at Roseland.  Oh, yeah.  Should be a lot of fun tonight.  It should be.  Say hi to all the Z100 listeners.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Big Z100, man.  You know, payback's a bitch there. 
[00:03:30]  No, I'm sure there will come a time when Sandy wants to go to a certain show that's  in town, Ricky Martin, and I don't go.  Oh, you don't?  No, I swear.  You get the tickets.  I get the tickets for her, but I don't go.  Why not?  I have corn tickets for her and I for the weekend.  Yeah?  Because she's into the corn.  Good.  She's into that corn stuff.  There won't be any shows.  I think she's into it, no doubt.  But I... 
[00:04:00]  No.  See, I've been going out with her a long time.  That's the difference.  Right?  Oh, is that it?  Oh, yeah.  You just...  You bail?  See, you're kind of like starting over.  You've got to realize that.  There are things you do in a relationship at first.  Just an observation.  I can't get inside my pal's head, but...  I mean, you go out with someone as long as I have with Sandy, then you start blowing off  like the no-doubt shows and stuff.  All right.  Easy.  Yeah.  No, no. 
[00:04:30]  There it is.  The look on Opie's face when he went to our boss and told him he needed Ricky Martin tickets  for Sandy.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Okay.  Virgin.  Hey! 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, you had a fun look on your face that time.  Okay.  So what?  What?  I'm not secure enough?  I didn't say you were not secure enough.  To go to a no-doubt show?  And it's up to you what you want to do with your life.  I don't care.  Well, let it be known I did not go to the Ricky Martin show.  I did get the tickets, you're right.  And it was embarrassing.  And I did get a Ricky Martin autographed photo for Sandy as well. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Hey!  What do I write this out to?  Oh, a girl.  Ew.  I didn't have to, like...  Hey!  I didn't have to meet him or anything.  Yeah.  I'm just assuming the record company, like, made out the picture, to be honest with you.  Yeah, it's probably somebody just sitting in there at the record company.  Okay, I'll sign that.  Yeah.  Ricky Martin.  So tonight, when you're at the No Doubt show...  Yeah.  ...you're going to get your lighter out when they, like, go into the slow one? 
[00:06:00]  You're a jackass, man.  Yeah.  Just sway back in Florence with the 14-year-old girls from C-100.  Hey!  Come on.  What's the move when this song comes on?  The same move as the other songs.  I stand and I watch the band performing.  What is this?  There's no move.  There's no move. 
[00:06:30]  I watch the band.  All right.  With everyone else.  That's what I do.  And if it's me, I don't want to know.  Come on.  Yeah.  Rock.  Don't think you're supposed to be there.  Don't think you're supposed to be there.  This is rock and roll.  First of all, Rick.  First of all, Rick.  Mr. Loverboy concert. 
[00:07:00]  What's your problem with this whole thing, Saul?  Yeah, Rick.  You've gone to the worst shows out of all of us.  I don't think you were taking a girl with you to the Loverboy show.  Yes, I did.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I did.  That didn't come.  What was his name?  I got paid to be there.  Yeah, I kind of like this one.  Anyway, look at Ben. 
[00:07:30]  Anyway, so if any of our faithful listeners are going to make it to the No Doubt show,  I want a full report.  I want to know what Ed's doing during these hits.  Oh, you know damn well tomorrow you'll be getting pogo.  Dude, I was at the No Doubt show.  Anthony was dancing.  He was dancing.  He was great.  He got his lighter on.  He was like pogoing.  He was dancing.  He was marching.  He wore his NSYNC concert t-shirt to the show. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And then he was in front of Glenn.  He was just like a cabin from Bush to try to get our attention.  He dyed his hair pink and started talking in a British accent.  Yeah, that's exactly.  You know our listeners.  He's full of crap.  And I expect our listeners to be nothing but honest tomorrow.  Dude, it's a fun night out at Roseland with my girlfriend to go see.  No doubt.  Is there a problem with that?  You don't have to explain yourself.  I'm not. 
[00:08:30]  I'm totally not explaining myself.  I'm just saying that's what is certainly worth bringing up on the radio show, though.  Of course.  I can see it's doing that all.  Hey.  Come on.  Whoa.  You kind of rocked on here, Ed.  Look what you're saying.  Don't tell me how you're saying.  Okay.  Okay.  Come on.  You won't be wearing any makeup like Rick did to the Loverboy show, though, right? 
[00:09:00]  No.  Rick wore some eyeliner, I believe, was what Rick wore.  No, I won't be wearing any.  No, that was to the Ramones show.  You know that band, the cool band, the Ramones?  That was the makeup.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Dude, I don't even care if you went to see K. Tara.  Don't turn this around on me.  Wait, wait.  We got it, though.  Ed bought a brand new pair of Jordache for tonight.  Don't try to turn this around on me.  Yeah.  Brand new pair of Jordache.  See, we only deal with the facts here, Rick.  Right.  It is a fact that Ed's going to the No Doubt show.  Yes. 
[00:09:30]  So?  But to justify that.  He's going to be twice the age of everybody on there.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.  To justify that wearing makeup is okay because it was a Ramones show, that is.  Yeah, there's no defense against that.  Plenty.  It's like, hey, man, you know, yeah, I wore full eye makeup and eyeliner and ruse,  but it was a Pantera show, so I'm okay.  Rick's trying to make.  And anal C was warming up, so I'm fine.  Anal C.  Rick's trying to make more of this than there is. 
[00:10:00]  And to Rick's defense, as is Opie.  Trying to make a little more of this than there really is.  I don't really have to do much with this.  I don't care.  I'm just following Opie.  He's making funny.  I'm right behind.  I hope he doesn't stop too short.  Oh, I'll give you something.  It'll be right up your end.  It's already there.  I'll give you something to abuse me about.  Wanted to go to the STP show last night.  Really wanted to go.  Ben was there.  Ben was great, huh?  Awesome. 
[00:10:30]  Unbelievable.  One of my favorite bands.  Really wanted to go.  Had to blow off the STP show, Anthony, last night.  The STP show.  Right.  Why?  Should we take a break?  Let's get up.  Why did I just abuse him for 15 minutes?  Well, I had more important things to do last night than the STP show.  What's that?  The STP, one of my favorite bands of all time, I believe.  What'd you have to do?  I was at a birthday party. 
[00:11:00]  No, one of those kiddie parties that, like for the one-year-old that will never remember  that he's having a party.  No.  The opposite end of the spectrum.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now I'm remembering from yesterday, you told me.  I went to my grandma's 90th birthday party last night instead of going to the STP show.  Did you slip her the tongue for her birthday?  Was it that grandma?  I only have one.  So it was her that you slipped the tongue to many years ago? 
[00:11:30]  No, the tongue never went in her mouth.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  It was approaching her mouth when she told me to close my mouth.  Right.  It was approaching her mouth when she put her hand on top of your head and pushed it down.  Now, if you're going to stick that out.  No, I was at my grandma's 90th birthday last night.  Oh, okay.  Got to thank the fine people at Baxter's Grill in Port Washington for throwing the bash.  Well, I can't really abuse you on that.  That's a family obligation.  I understand family issues.  That's fine. 
[00:12:00]  You know, you probably had fun anyway.  Yeah, you're hanging out with your brothers and stuff and your family.  You're going to tip in a few.  You're really going to let me off the hook here?  What am I going to do?  I sound like I'm just trying to make something out of nothing if I'm abusing you.  That's all.  I understand it's the kiss thing and stuff.  It's kind of funny, but, you know.  You must have had fun, though, hanging out with the family.  We had a great time.  And then Sandy drove the cabrio to the restaurant.  So I get out.  Okay.  I get out.  Now you're getting a little closer to something I can sink my teeth into. 
[00:12:30]  So I leave the restaurant.  There's notes all over the damn windshield.  Oh, really?  I think we're a little more popular than we realize.  Diamond dust.  Is this the fag moment?  Exactly.  That was one.  Practically word for word, right on the windshield.  I made diamonds dust.  Nice car.  That's pretty good.  Bunch of wow signs on the car and stuff.  I'm like, oh, okay.  But it was a good time.  How pathetic, though.  My grandma, she left completely snotted. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I have one of these, like, 90-year-old grandmothers that are still happy.  There's other people that say, yeah, my grandma's, you know, 90 and doing really well.  And then you meet them or something.  Yeah, it's like, oh, well.  They're just a shell.  Right.  My grandma still parties.  She still drinks.  Totally coherent.  Coherent.  Cool.  Could live on her own, but she's not currently.  Up until recently, still going to Atlantic City with her, like, 95, 96-year sister.  Yeah.  To gamble. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  And I'm looking at myself going, I'm so freaking pathetic, because they pretty much had a carrier  to my parents' car to get her out of there.  It's not.  And I had, like, two glasses of wine, and I'm like, a mess today, hungover.  Sounded like a psycho mark yesterday.  That's a lot of mess today.  But it was a lot of fun.  It was great seeing the cousins.  Yeah, it's cool.  How can I give you any flack about that?  And not many comments about our radio show, which is nice, because that's always uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Do you get that when you go to the family functions? 
[00:14:00]  All the time.  Like, you have the younger cousins and stuff that really dig the show, and they say, hey,  man, you know, you guys are huge at my school or whatever.  Then you got, like, the cool aunts and uncles.  Yeah.  You know, that come over to you and go, hey, you know, I really like the show.  Just want to let you know.  But then you have the people that you can tell just hate it.  The majority of the people in my family say, I'm going to kill you.  Do you know what my kids are doing now because of you?  Right.  What was that thing you did on the radio? 
[00:14:30]  I can't believe you did that.  Yeah.  Oh, people ask me about it, and I just say, I don't know.  No.  They totally disavow any knowledge of our actions.  Yeah.  And they say they're not even related.  I know.  They make excuses.  Well, actually, I was related through marriage.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not really on blood anymore.  I'm not related through blood or anything.  I don't even know them really.  I know them back in the third grade.  Yeah, that's what I get.  It's so awkward.  But a lot of the aunts and uncles love in the most offensive song contest. 
[00:15:00]  I was very surprised at that.  I'm very surprised we're sitting in these chairs today.  Really?  After my brother's song yesterday.  Well, I was thinking about that.  Jesus.  I was thinking about that.  You know, I'm thinking I might have went down yesterday, and I'm thinking maybe we should,  you know, play it one more time.  Well, right on the heels of other controversy that this show has been involved in, it did  seem like we were pushing our luck, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  But, I don't know.  Feeling a little better about ourselves today. 
[00:15:30]  Maybe we'll play it.  Well, the good news is we're here.  Yeah.  Today.  Yesterday, when we came to work, we weren't sure if we were going to be here.  Sometimes they let you finish out the week.  Oh, really?  Is that what you're thinking?  Yeah.  Sometimes they just let you finish out the week.  I had to take a call from Boston today.  There's a whole weekend where they can, you know, let things simmer down.  And a lot of people don't read the papers on Saturday or Sunday.  So then by Monday, it's old news.  I don't forgot about it.  You're just gone.  Oh, man.  I'm slapping whappy shows back here. 
[00:16:00]  Now I'm paranoid again, you ass.  Oh, you've been in radio long enough.  I learned that one real quick.  It was lesson number two for Anthony.  I had to take the call from Boston today.  We're really trying to get syndicated back to Boston because we have a huge following  that we kind of just left.  Yeah.  We didn't want to leave, but we were asked to leave at the time.  Now we're glad we're back home.  Yeah.  Because now the audience down here, I think, is twice as big and strong as it was in Boston.  But we would like to have some kind of presence up in Boston.  Boston, yeah.  And we were supposed to be syndicated. 
[00:16:30]  I'll tell everyone.  We were supposed to be syndicated back to Boston around January 1st.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What are we up to now?  April 6th, I believe.  April 6th.  Here it is.  April 6th.  And?  And you might ask, well, then why aren't you guys syndicated?  Because every time we screw up, it's like a prison sentence.  Yeah.  They add time onto our prison sentence.  Mm-hmm.  All we have to do is, like, behave for a month, and we pretty much get what we want.  Syndication back to Boston.  Just leave certain situations alone, and we'll be fine. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  But we're like, Ant and I are like crack addicts.  We can't put the pipe down.  We cannot put the pipe down.  We know it's wrong.  Things are handed in our lap, like a big rock is put in our hand.  And we know if we smoke it, we're going to get screwed.  Right.  But we can't throw the rock down.  Just addicted.  As much as we try.  We're addicted to this crap.  We know it's wrong.  We know that when we do certain things, we're going to catch hell for it.  And sometimes quite serious hell. 
[00:17:30]  But for some reason, for that thrill, for that radio that we get out of it for five, ten minutes,  we just have to do it.  I don't know what it is.  We tiptoe the line of being fired on a weekly basis.  And that's not a bid or anything.  All we have to do is like not tiptoe.  Don't go to the line there.  Be good.  We know what we're supposed to do, and we still can't do it.  Be good.  But for some reason, I think that's why our listeners like listening to this show. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  It's sort of a catch-22.  You guys know eventually we're going to blow up ourselves.  You know it.  Don't say that.  You said that last time.  God, I hate when you finally make that little announcement.  I mean, we're trying.  We're trying to behave, you know.  We're just trying to do entertaining, fun radio.  Other people don't seem to see it that way.  Hello.  My name is Anthony.  Right.  It's been two weeks since we were last not team players. 
[00:18:30]  We had a three-week run there, though.  One day at a time, they say.  You fall off the way.  We ought to get, like, chips like they do with AA, I guess.  What, do they give you chips?  Is there a 12-step program to totally effing up your career?  We're trying.  We need it.  Because as the boss said yesterday.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:19:00]  We were up to three weeks without getting in trouble, which was the longest for a while.  And we blew that streak two days ago, I guess.  I don't know how that happened.  So, officially, this is the second day that we're not in trouble.  So, we talked to the guy up in Boston.  Ugh.  And I was scared the first thing out of his mouth.  What the eff did you guys do?  What the hell is wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  And then to try to explain, and it never makes sense.  You always just sound like you're trying to explain yourself.  Yeah.  It's just like when somebody tries to explain themselves on this show. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  It just doesn't work.  You dig yourself deeper.  So, here we are.  Syndication never.  It was supposed to happen January 1st.  We're up to April 6th.  April 6th.  And rumor has it another month has been tacked on to our heads.  That's what I'm hearing now.  Another month.  There was no clean decision made as to when we were going to be syndicated.  Right.  But whenever that would have been, now there's an extra month on.  An extra month.  So, there's not even a light at the end of the tunnel. 
[00:20:00]  And all we have to do is, like, stay out of trouble.  And we get what we want.  We know that.  We know that as we sit here.  I don't know, man.  But things are, like, just dropped in our lap.  Yeah.  The rock falls right into the pipe and it jumps in our mouth.  The pipe is in your mouth?  Well, the crack pipe.  The crack pipe.  Come on.  I think we all know what analogy I'm making.  All right.  So, with that, we move on. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  With our little local New York radio show.  It's not little, though.  That's the cool part.  Or we would have been fired, I think.  Yeah.  But to the people that matter, they know who they are.  Mm-hmm.  Just want to let you know we're just trying to have some fun.  Yeah.  That is a little fun.  That's it. 
[00:21:00]  Just trying to have fun and entertain our faithful listeners.  That's all.  That's all we're trying to do here.  That's it.  If you think about it, really.  That's it.  Problem?  I don't see one.  All right.  Now, let's move on with the show.  Yeah.  I guess we're in the Daily News today.  We could discuss that.  We've got to play Joe's song again.  We have Stephen Lynch coming in today with two brand-new songs.  Brand-new songs?  Yep.  Rock.  Oh, we're going to get the new entry cut up, too? 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Another new entry in the Most Defensive Song contest.  There was a couple other things we had to get to today, too.  I can't remember.  Jay Moore might be stopping in.  I don't know.  It'll develop as we go here.  212-757-1027.  We'll be right back.  Hi.  This is Louis Black from The Daily Show.  And you're listening to two of the most psychotic human beings I've ever met.  My pals, O.P. and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  O.P.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  It's The O&A Show.  Well, there'll be a lot of helpful e-mails coming in from me.  And Wendy writing in, Anthony, do you want to borrow my skirt for tonight's No Doubt Show?  Vinny, Staten Island.  Anthony is going to be the designated alcohol purchaser for all 12- and 13-year-old girls. 
[00:22:30]  Chris from Jersey, please tell me that Anthony won't be wearing a belly shirt.  That's a No Doubt Show?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to be doing.  The people are pounding.  That's pretty funny.  Hey, come on.  All right, Jake has something to say.  Jake, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing today?  Pretty good.  You know, I was thinking about this whole syndication thing, and it's like that scene in Shawshank Renemption.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  You know, every time Warden Freeman goes in for his parole hearing, he's like,  oh, yeah, I'm rehabilitated.  I'm real good.  Nothing will happen again.  And they deny him, and he goes back.  And finally, the last time he goes in, he's like, you know what?  Screw you guys.  I haven't changed.  I don't care.  Well, we care.  I know.  We just have a weird way of showing it.  Well, it makes it fun on our side here.  You know, we watch you guys.  It's like watching, you know, it's like watching a jumper on the roof.  You're like, you're waiting for something to happen.  Like, come on, you want to take that next step? 
[00:23:30]  He falls off.  Oh, eventually, there'll be a big, disgusting stain on the sidewalk, and that's all that'll be left  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, and that's the only bad thing, because then afterwards, you walk away, you're like,  all right, now what?  Get something to eat or something.  Yeah, how true, how true.  That's pretty much it.  All right, Jake.  All right, guys, be good.  Thank you.  Over and out, Diamond Dutch.  10-4.  10-10-10-8.  Keep it between the ditches.  Good buddy.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy. 
[00:24:00]  Keep the shiny side up and the dirty side down.  Double nickels all the way.  I'm distracted, because Jennifer had an erotic dream about O&A.  What?  We always have a problem with these.  What?  What?  We like when you ladies have, like, an erotic dream about one of us.  Yeah.  When you lump us together, it's just, it's dream homo.  Dream homo.  Jennifer, what's going on?  Dream homo.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Yeah, one of those erotic...  I've had more than one.  This is why I'm calling. 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  Oh.  It's getting to be a problem.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, tell us about the last one.  Well, it's very vivid.  Yeah?  Yeah, vivid.  Well, just talking code, you know, you know some of the code words of this show, hopefully,  by now.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Um, it's kind of embarrassing.  I mean, like, you guys are, you know, pleasuring you guys, you're pleasuring me, and it's just...  Oh, yeah?  It's just, it's a constant thing.  It's like I'm, I'm, I am infatuated with you guys.  So...  I'm dreaming about you guys. 
[00:25:00]  Why?  How does it start?  How does it start?  Yeah, how does it start?  Give us a little rundown on the dream.  I have a feeling I'm going to be creeped out, but let's go.  No, it's, it's usually like, you know, we're friends, and we're, we're hanging out somewhere,  having a few drinks, and...  Not too weird yet.  Okay, good.  And then, you know, and then we're, we're all flirting and, uh, hanging out.  Good, good.  Attracted to each other, and one thing leads to another, and before you know it, the three  of us are just pleasuring each other.  Oh.  Okay, listen.  Are we all naked? 
[00:25:30]  You, uh, sometimes, sometimes, you know, sometimes not.  I mean, it's just, it's just very vivid in the fact that you guys are really there, like  the conversations, your personalities are there.  Uh, yeah.  Who's, uh, better?  Opie.  Yeah!  Well, then that, it sure is a dream.  All right, all right.  And then Sandy always gets in the way, you know, but...  Well, oh, well, then it is real life.  I was going to say, you sure it's a dream? 
[00:26:00]  Uh, it's really, I mean, it's getting to be a problem.  I wake up every morning, and I'm like, why is this happening?  I'm dreaming about these two guys that...  Do you have a boyfriend?  Are we, uh, did we put you on the rotisserie or anything in your dream?  Play cards on your back?  Not yet, no.  No?  Just taking our turns, going to town?  Yeah, like, uh, you know, like, uh, one, one of the dreams that I remember very vividly,  we were in a hotel room overlooking the ocean, and we were on, like, the 28th floor, and 
[00:26:30]  you guys, uh, had, we bought some wine, some good Pinot Grigio, and...  Sounds like the M.O.  And, uh, you know, uh, Psycho Mark made a delivery for us before that.  What's that, pot?  I'm sorry?  Some weed?  Are you sure this is a dream?  Well, you know, I've been listening to you guys long enough to know the realities.  That's what I'm saying, is that it's, like, really in my brain.  It's, like, these are all realities for me, in my, in my dreams.  Yeah, now, uh, do you have a boyfriend?  Not at the moment. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah?  No?  And...  I'm not getting any, you know, that's the other thing.  Maybe that's it, you're pent up.  What do you look like?  Um, I'm cute, you know, I'm, like, 5'5", uh, blonde hair.  Uh-huh.  Uh, I weigh about 125.  Uh-huh.  Big boobs?  Yeah, they're ample.  They're ample?  Uh-huh.  I like the word ample.  Ample.  Very nice.  All right.  But it's always, you know, I have to be honest, Anthony is always like the main...  I mean, Anthony, sorry. 
[00:27:30]  Opie is always like the main man, you know?  All right.  I don't know, I think it's just that...  I don't know, I don't know what it is.  Jennifer?  Only if Sandy takes...  Ah, you can't say that on the air, Opie.  What?  I hugged, but I'm not on the air, so I heard him.  No, you are on the air.  No, I mean, I'm not.  No, we had to dump out, Opie said.  Exactly.  The F word.  Oh, my God.  Don't you think Sandy would have a problem with that?  Ah, she has a problem with a lot of things. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, really?  Exactly.  You're willing to make your dreams come true, huh?  If it was just me, you, and Ant, and forget it.  Sandy should be, you know, part of the management team of this company.  Let's just put it that way.  She, too, has a problem with a lot of things I do.  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, she chose that life.  She has to deal with it.  Nah, she's cool.  Hey, if I'm tooling...  She better be cool.  You're paying for her cruise in her car. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, if I'm tooling you, can you change your name?  I definitely don't want to be saying that one.  Anthony, Anthony, my real name's Jennifer.  Oh, it's not?  It's not Jennifer?  I'm sorry I chose that name, man.  I didn't mean to.  No, thanks.  All right.  All of a sudden, I'd be doing it.  No, but seriously, guys.  She'd leave with my wallet.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I would just be satisfied and happy with the whole experience.  I wouldn't want anything else from you. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Where are you right now?  Uh, in my car.  You want to play a quick round of what's in my pants?  Uh, sure.  Really?  All right.  What road are you on?  I can't tell you that.  No?  Uh-uh.  What are you wearing?  Uh, jeans and a T-shirt right now.  Well, get out of those jeans.  Let's go.  Get out of those jeans.  My God.  How do I do that?  What do I do?  I pull over the side of the road and put the phone in my pants?  Yeah, you just loosen up your pants and then you put the phone down against your thatch 
[00:29:30]  and you do a little rubbing back and forth so we can get kind of a line on what you're  packing down there.  Right.  What kind of phone?  All right.  Well, I don't think the line of cars in front of me or behind me would appreciate it, so  I will pull over.  Oh, man.  We like when the girls do it while they're driving.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of panties you got on?  As the ambulance wheeled up to the accident scene, they're wondering how the phone got  fixed.  No, the best panties are the school bus in front of me.  Oh, good.  All right.  What kind of panties do you have under those jeans? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, Victoria's Secret.  Nice.  Oh, well, that's telling right there, isn't it?  I'm thinking black.  That's a little telling.  Yeah, no.  Today I have on white.  White?  Okay.  White.  Yes.  Must not be that time of the month.  Very good.  I got your cycle down, then, too.  Usually, you girls break out the brown panties.  Oh.  Oh, you're gross.  You're gross.  I'm...  That's okay.  They don't usually start out brown.  No, I'm saying...  I'm not lying.  I know you're not.  You girls like the darker colors when, you know, your friend comes. 
[00:30:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  So, are you ready to play What's in My Pants?  Yeah, I just have to get away from the school bus with the fourth graders on it in front  of me first, okay?  All right.  We'll get a little thrill out of it.  All right.  As you pull over...  I vote Mohawk.  As you pull over, I've got to read a few instant feedbacks.  Steve from Jersey.  I had a sex dream about spaz.  Oh, my God.  That's a nightmare.  He was the pivot man at Nambla's Circle.  Wah.  The pivot man at a circle jerk. 
[00:31:00]  That's funny.  Kevin Spacey checking in, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Ant.  What time should I pick you up for the No Doubt Show tonight?  Kevin.  Damn, there's so many school buses out.  I hope they cube out my face on the rag magazines like they did that young male model he was with  the other day.  You know, if Jay Moore's coming by, we've got to get that rag magazine to show him what  his buddy Kevin Spacey's been up to.  We asked for that two days ago.  Who do you think that was in the pictures?  All right, are you ready to play What's in My Pants?  I am. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  All right.  Your jeans are down.  You've got your Victoria's Secrets ready to go there?  Yeah, I'm nervous.  Nervous?  It's just Ant and I and a few of our friends.  No one else listening.  Okay.  They're too busy listening to Z100.  No doubt.  Yeah, that's the station that they're listening to with those stupid DJs over there at Z100.  Z100.  Z100, that's our new enemy.  They suck.  They really suck. 
[00:32:00]  Whenever you're ready, guys.  Don't worry.  No one's listening to our show because they have PLJ on.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, can I tell you something?  PLJ is stupid.  I went out happy hour Friday night with a lot of professionals and everyone is so in the closet  about being an Opie and Anthony fan.  Yeah.  It's so amazing.  Kind of like Jay Moore.  It's so funny.  Yeah.  It's like little things are being said like, okay, terrific. 
[00:32:30]  And I just look at them and go, you've been listening, haven't you?  Yes.  But we hate PLJ.  Yeah.  We feel threatened by those guys.  They're our enemy.  That's right.  If there's one station that pops into the top of my head that we hate on this show, it's PLJ.  Yeah.  Sure it's not jamming?  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:00]  I know.  Q104.  Yeah.  That's an oldie station, isn't it?  That's right, Anthony.  They play nothing but old classic rock.  Yeah.  And we hate them.  Oh, Samuel.  Virgin.  Okay. 
[00:33:30]  Our new enemy, Hot 97.  Hot 97.  They're really bad.  Right.  We don't like them.  We don't like dance music.  Hey, how about that Lamega?  Hey, they're all like speaking another language over there or something.  It's like it's not even English.  I also don't like Mike and the Angry Wolf. 
[00:34:00]  I hear that's a new radio show.  La, la, la, la.  Oh, hey.  Hi, Jennifer.  The last five minutes was very inside, I know, but hey, are you ready to play?  Yeah.  Okay.  If you would, please put the phone down your pants, rub it side to side, up and down, and  in a circular motion, and then do not reveal what you have in your pants until we ask you.  Okay.  All right.  I can't believe I'm doing this.  Hold on. 
[00:34:30]  Is that enough?  Is that up and down?  It was both, side to side and up and down.  Wow.  All right.  You've got to do side to side first.  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Up and down.  Up and down, please.  Okay.  Hold on.  Wait.  My shirt got in the way.  Hold on.  Oh, okay.  I think we all know. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Or at least, if it isn't, I'm amazed, but everyone's got the same guess, I'm sure.  Yeah.  What is it?  I'm going to say, I'm going to say, wood floor, totally shaved.  Opie?  I'm going to say, wood floor with a little tuft.  Okay.  Psycho Mark is in the studio, so we might as well let him play along.  Jiffy Pop.  Jiffy Pop?  What?  You're talking huge?  Huge bush.  Well, she's wearing Victoria's Secret little thong, too, so.  That is so wrong. 
[00:35:30]  You're such a waste, man.  No, I'm serious.  She has little Victoria's Secret panties on.  And you're thinking like a pool rack filled with Afro hair.  Yeah, right.  I know.  All right.  Thank you, Psycho.  All right.  Jennifer, what's in your pants?  Opie's right.  With the little tuft, right?  Yeah.  Where's the little tuft?  Right where it should be.  The Hitler mustache.  So it's kind of like a Hitler mustache.  Kind of like an exclamation point.  Uh, no, it's all there. 
[00:36:00]  And then there's just like this nice little...  That's a Hitler mustache.  Hey, where'd she go?  She hung up.  Oh, God damn it.  Her phone.  Her cell phone.  All right.  I've won that one, Anthony.  Okay.  Ann Marie doesn't like her attitude.  Ann Marie, what's wrong?  Guys, yours are so nice.  Huh?  Don't worry about the other radio stations.  Oh, believe me, we're not.  We're not.  We just spend so much time talking about them.  Forget it.  The Hitler mustache.  The Hitler mustache.  We love you because you're down to earth.  All right.  It was an inside joke to a lot of people listening to make sure that we're behaving. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I didn't get it.  All right.  Over my head.  Yeah.  Well, it was very inside.  And guys, I have a complete wood floor.  All right.  Rock.  More power to you.  It's perfect.  Bye-bye.  Thank you, Ann Marie.  All right, Ann.  Let's take a break.  Okay.  And we'll be back with more of your phone calls.  212-757-1027.  Still to come.  Stephen Lynch with two brand new songs.  Jay Moore stopping by.  We've got to talk about the Daily News article. 
[00:37:00]  We've got to replay Anthony's brother's entry into the Most Defensive Song Contest.  Yeah.  And lots more to do.  Stay there.  A gigantic new box is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG 7.  Tony and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  Ah, yeah.  Smashing pumpkins in the background.  They're playing what?  April 25th, Hammerstein Ballroom, Anthony? 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  That's going to be a great show.  Latest CD getting rave reviews.  I was jamming that on the subway.  A few weeks ago.  This week I've been jamming the Stone Temple Pilots' latest CD.  Bunch of really good songs on that.  Oh, yeah.  Speaking of shows, we've got tickets to the Filter and Veruca Salt Show April 20th at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  And we'll give those tickets away in a little while.  All right?  And if you have anything for the show, 212-757-1027. 
[00:38:00]  Let's go to Justin.  Hi, Justin.  Hey, this is Justin.  Yeah.  My mom's sending me to therapy today at 4 or 4.30.  Why?  Why?  Because I don't know.  When I drive up with my friends, I scream out, okay, terrific.  Yeah.  And, hey there, and all this other stuff.  Yeah.  And my friend Pete and this stupid kid in the backseat doesn't get it.  So I'm screaming out at people.  They think something weird now.  And now I'm across the street at my friend's house.  And I'm watching my mom. 
[00:38:30]  I'm at my friend Pete's like, yo, I'm in his house.  That's the exact same.  I'm watching my mom.  Oh, okay.  Terrific.  I don't want to go to therapy.  They think I'm crazy now.  Because I'm like, okay, terrific.  Like I'm talking about like Dirty Sanchez and stuff.  Right, right, right.  Hello?  I think they erased.  ONA?  My Christopher Reeve falling down the stairs, Ophie.  Oh, really?  They hung up.  I can't use that, but I could.  Oh.  He hung up on himself.  Okay, where's Christopher Reeve falling down the stairs?  Well, there's a problem with your machine over there, Anthony. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, there it is.  We have a different template.  I know.  Well, the new morning show needed some space on your machine, and some of our stuff got  erased or mixed up.  We don't like that.  No, we don't like that.  It's not the fault of the new morning show.  No, I wouldn't say it.  Just people around here had to kind of reorganize stuff to give those guys some room so they could  play some sound effects and stuff.  How's that going, the new morning show?  I haven't even heard of it.  I sleep so damn late that I don't get a chance to listen to anything. 
[00:39:30]  I like listening to them, Anthony.  I've enjoyed their first week on the radio.  Yeah.  You know?  Okay.  I don't know.  You haven't met them yet?  No.  I initiated them yesterday.  I don't know if they talked about it this morning.  What?  They come in and say hey and stuff, you know?  Yeah.  I'm like, ah, guys, welcome to New York.  Check this out.  I've got to show you something.  I pop in the 100-year-old lady getting banged.  Just to see how cool they are.  Sure.  They passed the test.  Oh, good.  They like it.  They were definitely horrified. 
[00:40:00]  That's cool.  They're like, that's got to be the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Cool.  I'm like, all right, cool.  You guys can hang with us.  You know?  I'm going to have to wake up early.  And check it out?  Yeah.  I know a lot of people are convinced we're up early to check out morning shows, but no.  I mean, I'm up probably 9.30.  I'm up in time.  About 9 o'clock to check out the market.  I was going to say, I'm up in time to check out the stock ticker.  Yes.  Certainly.  9.30.  I'm a little pissed today at the certain stock that's not yippee. 
[00:40:30]  They announced great earnings yesterday, and it takes a 10-point dive.  But what happened?  That's a huge buying opportunity for tomorrow, I believe, Anthony.  Yeah.  The last two weeks have been great buying opportunities.  Unfortunately, I bought three weeks ago.  All right.  Steve from Bay Ridge on the instant feedback.  Hey, Greg and Anthony, are you guys pissed that the Daily News gave out your real names? 
[00:41:00]  That's happened before.  Okay.  Our real names have been in the paper many times.  I just don't get it, though, because, yes, I was born with the name Greg Hughes.  Oh, big surprise to everyone.  It hasn't been my real name since I was 9.  You know?  It was a name that was given to me, but unfortunately, I've been stuck with this Opie thing since I was, like, 9 or 10.  Yeah.  But I don't understand, you know, these journalists.  Do they have to print our real names to show everyone that they might know a little more about us than anyone else? 
[00:41:30]  Is that what it is?  I think people that are familiar with the show, they'll be reading it going, well, who is this?  Yeah.  Because me, it's like, you know, Kumia tells us.  Kumia?  It's like, at least put Anthony tells us, you know.  I mean, you can put our first and last names at the beginning of the article, but then when they're crediting the quotes in the article, they're using our last names like anyone knows them.  Right.  I don't know.  I love when people call me Opie Hughes.  That's completely wrong. 
[00:42:00]  I want to see him use my real name.  It's Mike Hunt.  Mike Hunt?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Use that one.  No, I'm not pissed.  It's just, I don't know.  It's stupid, though.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're getting at, you know, throwing our real names all over the paper like, hey, see, I did some research and I found out their real names.  It's not actually Opie Anthony.  Oh, really?  I'm a little disturbed because they didn't accurately quote me.  Yeah, we had some great quotes in this article. 
[00:42:30]  Of course, we're talking about the Jay Moore fight with Fat Guy.  It made the Daily News today in the gossip column.  Screw that stupid little radio column.  Now we're in the gossip column.  It's in the celebrity news section of the paper, Anthony.  At one point, because they wanted to know what the fight was about between Jay and Billy and Paul from Air Sick.  And it says that I told them, Billy called Jay a derogatory term for homosexual and Jay made fun of his weight. 
[00:43:00]  And that's in quotation marks.  They have that quoted.  Right.  That isn't what I said.  I said, Billy called Jay a derogatory term for a homosexual.  I believe the word was faggot.  Faggot.  Right.  And Jay obviously is not gay, really.  He's married.  They didn't put that in the paper.  And Jay made fun of his weight.  I didn't say Jay made fun of his weight.  I said Jay called him a fat F.  Right.  And the funny thing is, the lady, when you said that yesterday, she was like, oh, this is great. 
[00:43:30]  This is great stuff.  Because I used the real word.  I didn't just say F.  So.  And then they quote it like that's exactly what I said because it's not paraphrased or anything.  But that isn't exactly what I said.  Where did they find that goofy picture of Jay Moore?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Rico Suave.  It's all Hollywooded out there.  It is.  Only at an award show or something.  That's not the Jay Moore we know.  No.  The Jay Moore we get to see is his eyes are never open that far. 
[00:44:00]  He's going to get mad that we're goofing on him.  Oh.  I see.  But it's a good little mention in the daily news today.  Yeah.  And the, what is it, the gossip column?  I don't even have it.  Russ and Malloy or.  Russian Malloy.  What's it called?  Russian Malloy, I believe.  The dish or something.  Oh, is it?  What, Spaz?  Oh, thank you, Spaz.  Say what you're called.  It's Russian Malloy. 
[00:44:30]  That's what I just said.  All right.  There we go.  Thank you, Spaz.  That helped the radio show a lot.  Who's the blonde?  Hey.  Tara Reid dazzled date Carson Daly in a glittery top.  Look at that.  Whoa.  Man, this Carson's getting some trim, huh?  Yeah.  Holy mother of pearl.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:45:00]  Jennifer Love Hewitt laughed me.  Where's the latest friggin' Britney Spears look-alike?  I'll spear her.  Yeah, he was like with Aguilera for a while.  Was he?  I don't know what happened there, but they were hinting that they might have had a little thing going there.  Boy, my, how the MTV look has changed over the years.  Who would think Carson Daly would be the guy?  You know?  You'd go back over the years.  J.J. Jackson.  J.J. Jackson.  J.J. Jackson wasn't banging like Britney Spears type singers. 
[00:45:30]  Alan Hunter wasn't hanging with the in crowd.  Alan Hunter.  Who was Alan Hunter banging?  Well, what about Mark Goodman?  Mark Goodman.  Well, we know who he was banging.  We found out a lot of things about Mark Goodman in our stay here at N.E.W.  Yeah, we know who he was.  Very interesting.  I think we have some audio from one of his sexual romps. 
[00:46:00]  Let me hear that again.  Well, when it queues up, you'll be able to listen to it again, Anthony.  Mark Goodman's bedroom.  Okay, terrific.  All right, get that out of there.  All right.  Yeah, Mark Goodman was getting something. 
[00:46:30]  Some people don't have a sense of humor, if you know what I mean.  Come on, that can't be off limits, too.  So, listen, Rick's getting some of the audio of the fight, because they're talking about  the Daily News today.  Yeah.  The fight from two days ago.  We haven't heard it back yet.  I know.  I want to hear some of that.  So, as soon as Rick's ready with that, we will put it on the air, okay?  Okay, terrific.  But as far as using our real names in the paper, whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Yeah, that was the name I was born with. 
[00:47:00]  And.  Oh, yes.  As we go to spots here.  I don't know.  I think we've got to play Joe's song again.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we do, though.  We definitely do.  We're doing the most offensive song contest.  And Joe's song yesterday might have put the contest out of reach.  Yeah.  But we did get some really funny entries today.  Really funny.  Fox on the Run.  Oh, my God.  Whoever wrote Fox on the Run out there, you had us peeing in our pants. 
[00:47:30]  And I don't even think we could get the song on the radio.  I know.  Because just think what rhymes with Fox.  Yeah.  That has something to do with a guy's junk.  Yeah.  All right.  So, it's Courtney's last name.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  So, instead of Fox on the Run, it's Warren on the Nun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was outrageous, to say the least.  So, should we explain this song again, Anthony? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, it's the most offensive song contest.  Uh-huh.  We've been running it for a while now.  Uh-huh.  And in order to win, you have to write the most offensive song.  Things that offend people, Opie?  What is it?  Racism.  Racism.  Anti-Semitism.  Sure.  Child abuse.  Yes.  Child sexual abuse.  I mean, this is all the most offensive.  These are things that offend people.  Sexual orientation.  Right.  Gay bashing.  Has been covered. 
[00:48:30]  Things like that.  Very offensive to a lot of people.  In our community.  No one has been saved from this contest.  Right.  No one.  So, in order to win, you have to write the most offensive song.  Being creative, original, and indeed offensive.  And we've had some in here that have made us cringe.  And we were thinking, maybe we shouldn't play them.  But who are we?  This is the most offensive song contest.  We have to leave it to the people.  We understand it's offensive.  You're not going to write us letters and emails and phone calls and go, 
[00:49:00]  Oh, my God, that was horrible.  How could you play that?  We know.  That's the whole reason.  Right.  Oh.  I get so angry when people bitch you about this.  And you guys are calling us wimps.  If you're offended right now by anti-Semitism, by racism, by sexual abuse of children, by gay bashing,  don't listen right now.  We're playing songs.  If you're offended by spaz, turn off your radio.  Right.  Oh, wait.  We just lost our whole audience. 
[00:49:30]  Hold on.  Let me take that one back.  Oh, they can never come back.  But that's how it works.  And, you know, what are we going to say?  That's the way it is.  We understand that.  So with that said, a lot of people saying Joe, Anthony's brother, really sneaking in a nasty song,  has put the contest out of reach, is what a lot of people are saying with this little ditty here.  Okay?  All right.  As we go to break, check it out.  Oh, my dear, I've built some ovens just to cook up Jews. 
[00:50:00]  We'd sweep them down and gas them good.  Sold their clothes and shoes.  With a big team here and a boiled timey there.  Here, a kike, there, a Jew.  Everywhere, a dead Jew.  Oh, my dear, I've built some ovens just to cook up Jews.  Oh, my dear, I've wanted lampshade made of evil skin.  We'd peel it off and hang to dry before we threw them in. 
[00:50:30]  With a nipple here and a navel there.  Don't you skin with too much hair?  Oh, my dear, I needed lampshade made of evil skin.  Oh, my dear, I'm why did you not cook Schwarzers and Spicks?  You let the mongrels get the brazy meeks and box and shinks.  With a hot tongue here and a sink higher there. 
[00:51:00]  He let you sell at you.  Everywhere, a dead Jew.  Oh, my dear, I needed ovens just to cook some Jews.  Dr. C. O.P. and Anthony.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Go take a mitle.  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:51:30]  Filter playing the Hammerstein Ballroom with Baruch Assault April 20th.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.  And I believe we have a pair of tickets right now for the 10th caller.  And 2-1-2-7-5-7-1027.  If you're not a filthy man, please allow someone else to win, okay?  Yes, yes.  They do indeed rock. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, where's Spaz?  Spaz has to get over here.  He started telling me something during a commercial break.  And I'm just like, no, no.  We need this on the air.  Spaz always trying to educate us, Opie.  Yes.  So he was trying to enlighten me on, I don't know, journalistic protocol.  Oh, because we're in the gossip column of the Daily News today about the Jay Moore fight. 
[00:52:30]  And I was saying.  And they used our real names.  And we're like, they don't need to do that.  You know, it really doesn't matter.  I mean, who cares?  They've done it before.  Right.  But when they attribute the quotes in the paper to each of us, they do so by saying, like mine,  it says, Kumia tells us, you know, using the last name.  Hughes tells us.  And anybody familiar with the show, we don't use them on the air because they don't really roll off the tongue. 
[00:53:00]  So why would they attribute the quotes?  Why not just say, Anthony said, and according to Opie, blah, blah, blah.  Because it would make a lot easier reading.  I have to say it again.  I'm not proud of this, but Opie's been my name since I was nine or ten.  It's not a radio name.  It's just what I've been called since I was really little.  Greg is not even my name anymore.  When people say, Greg, I don't even turn my head.  I don't know who they're talking about.  So what do you have in this, Spaz? 
[00:53:30]  Well, I was just telling Anthony that it is normal to attribute quotes to the last name of the person.  Right.  And where did you learn this, Spaz?  I took journalistic classes and I wrote for the college paper.  And that's what you were taught?  Yes.  To use the last name when you're quoting a person?  Yes.  When you're quoting a quote, you use the last name.  When you're quoting a quote.  Even if it's called the Opie and Anthony show and your characters, as it would be, are named Opie and Anthony. 
[00:54:00]  Your principal characters of the show are Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  Even so, because in the top of the article, it clearly states Anthony, Cumia, and Greg Hughes.  So everybody now knows your last name throughout the entire article.  They now attribute to Cumia to Anthony and Hughes to Opie.  So now they know because it's at the top of the article, which is what most people read as the first paragraph.  Right.  Then when they get down, then they know that Cumia is your last name. 
[00:54:30]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  You're an idiot, man.  You really are.  But it's true.  So why don't they use actors' real names when they're quoting actors?  Because, you know, a lot of the actors out there, that's not their real names.  You realize that, right?  It's not their birth names.  Kevin Spacey's not his birth name?  Well, I don't know.  Tom Hanks?  I don't know in the Kevin Spacey, you know, as far as Kevin Spacey goes, but most celebrities, not saying we're celebrities, but we're in the celebrity column, most of the people they talk about, that's not their real names either. 
[00:55:00]  Uh-huh.  Well, I wouldn't know.  I really don't know anything about that, but I was just saying that it's proper protocol in journalistic writing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  Well, look at that.  We learned something new from Spaz.  Wait, Spaz, do you have a definition for protocol?  Uh, protocol, yeah, it's called, it means properness.  It means like, uh...  Properness?  Yes, proper, like, uh... 
[00:55:30]  Properness.  Yeah, if I had to pick a word for it, it means properness, like a set order of things, it's gentleman-like.  All right, and do you have a definition for properness?  Properness.  Um, protocol.  Nice.  Properness, nice.  Okay, not mean.  Not...  No, because everything's proper, everything's in the right place.  All right.  Proper.  Okay.  Very good.  Well, I was just, you know, wondering, and then Spaz came in and enlightened us.  And don't forget, tomorrow's Spaz's Week in Review. 
[00:56:00]  I'm hearing rumors about something that happened to you on the streets today.  And you're going to, like, talk about it tomorrow?  Want to give us just a hint?  Uh, I was walking into the building today and something wet was hitting my head.  Something wet was hitting your head?  Yes.  Um...  And what do you think this wetness was?  Well, I looked up at the sky and there was no clouds where I was standing.  Right.  And there was nobody, like, squeegeeing the windows, so I was just wondering where it was coming from. 
[00:56:30]  And it wasn't a bird.  And I was just, it was just dripping all over my jacket, my book bag, and my head.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Yeah.  And, uh...  And what do you think it is now?  Yeah.  Because I heard some people helped you out with what was going on up in the sky.  It could be somebody was leaking off the roof or out the window.  Taking a leak.  Taking a leak.  And you'll be discussing this in your Week in Review tomorrow?  A little warning to the, uh, your fellow New Yorkers?  Do you honestly believe someone was taking a leak on you?  But that was the explanation that I got. 
[00:57:00]  I didn't know what happened.  And somebody told me that I was taking...  There's probably 20 explanations before that, that I would think of.  Before someone peeing on you in a building where the windows don't open.  That's the only explanation I got.  I don't know how...  So, I...  And don't wreck it.  Uh-uh.  So, for your Week in Review, you'll be discussing this?  Yes.  All right.  That's just Ant's opinion.  I want you to have the spaz opinion.  What you think happened to you today. 
[00:57:30]  And what you could say to your fellow New Yorkers to warn them against this atrocity.  What?  You washed your hair three times in the bathroom?  Yes.  Which I didn't really want to do because when I wash it, it gets fluffy.  And poofy.  Now...  Wow, I'm amazed.  Someone peed on my head out of the building where the windows don't open.  This building, right? 
[00:58:00]  And it could have been a construction site.  You know.  Don't blow it, man.  For more.  Okay.  Well, he's already got it down, doesn't he?  You have it down already, right?  Your comments?  We don't want you changing any of your comments.  Well, I haven't written my comments on this yet.  Oh, okay.  Then we'll leave it alone.  I'd rather do this one off the cuff.  Huh.  You want to do it now?  Maybe just a little preview?  A little preview?  Maybe I can tell you a couple of things that it might be?  I don't want to let loose now.  I'd rather do it all in one shot so I can really, you know, get the subject. 
[00:58:30]  When was this now?  Yesterday?  This morning.  Oh, this morning.  Look at his hair.  It's all poofy.  It gets poofy when I wet it.  I had it flattened.  It gets wavy, too.  Can I?  I have to give you at least three other things it could have been.  I mean, I...  And if you're going to do that, then let him do his rant first.  Okay.  I can't do the rant right now.  I've got to do it tomorrow.  I've got to build up more anger.  God, I've got to...  You've got to build up more anger? 
[00:59:00]  You're convinced someone leaked on your head and you need to build up more anger?  Who are these people leaking on your head?  Who do you believe they are?  You've got to have an idea.  Some kids might go...  I know people like to play pranks.  Some kids might go up to the top of the roof and say, you know, hey, I'm going to whiz on somebody's head.  How many...  Are there possibly 40 floors on this building?  It's a 40-story building that we're in. 
[00:59:30]  They might have good aim.  They use smart pee, like you see in Baghdad.  The missiles, remember those?  That went down the air conditioning shaft?  They have smart penises.  It could be construction workers.  Construction workers on the roof of the building.  And they said, hey, look, there's spaz 40 stories down.  I'm going to take a leak, compensate for wind, all kinds of...  Wind eddies off the building, altitude, and I'm going to pee on them. 
[01:00:00]  You're going to...  And you've got to realize they're going to have to lead their leak because you're walking.  No, because not...  What I did was because I felt the drip, so I stopped and I looked up.  Let me tell you something.  A frigging bathtub of water dropped off a 40-story building.  You might feel a drop.  You might feel a drop on you.  A bathtub full of water.  The dispersal.  It would be amazing.  Maybe it was a giant mosquito.  Oh, that could be.  His venom.  All right, spaz, you need to rant about this problem. 
[01:00:30]  So who do you think this is?  What is this?  And why did it...  You must have felt very angry.  Is it some type of conspiracy?  You must have felt violated.  No, it's just that it was very weird.  I was walking here and there were some clouds here, but then I stopped and in one place there  was no clouds.  There was just like a circle around a bright blue sky.  Oh, like the eye of a storm almost.  And then all of a sudden, that's when I felt the drips.  You felt drips.  Underneath that one spot.  How about...  Politics and stuff.  He's as dumb as a boss of rock. 
[01:01:00]  His lips are back and when he tries to talk.  This is it, so we can review it fast.  You dumb f***.  Ha, that's pretty good.  Look at that, you got a little jingle.  You got a jingle for your week in review starting tomorrow.  Now, how much actual liquid was on you?  I gotta know.  Well, I saw spotty stuff on my leather coat.  A couple of spots on your leather coat.  Yes, and then my hair was a little bit drenched. 
[01:01:30]  It was like a little bit like a...  Like a little wet.  Damn.  Damn.  Over your entire head?  Yeah, well, actually, it dripped down like the back of my neck just a little bit.  Do you understand?  It's psychotic.  That we did have some rain this morning.  I felt some raindrops.  There was some rain this morning.  But that's the weird part about it.  I specifically went under this circle of blue sky that was...  Dude, do you know how hot...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I'm amazed. 
[01:02:00]  What is it?  A cartoon where a cloud goes right over your head and it rains on you?  Don't you think that the clouds surrounding this clear area could pepper you with water?  Rain that maybe is being carried by the wind?  Don't you know those clouds are so high up that you could see a cloud that looks like it's a mile away above you,  but you could be getting hit with the rain from that cloud because the wind takes it over to you?  There was no wind.  The wind was going maybe one mile away.  Do you know about winds aloft? 
[01:02:30]  Do you know that there are different wind levels?  The wind could be going in a completely different direction 20,000 feet above your head than it is here on the ground where you're protected by buildings and whatnot.  And he believes he got leaked on.  I understand.  I'm going to have to take his side on this.  Okay, leaked on.  It couldn't possibly be maybe that it was raining.  Maybe...  He says there were no clouds in the area.  Maybe it rained and...  Were there clouds in the sky at all?  There were clouds, but I was under the spot where there was no clouds.  Right.  That magical circle that follows you around. 
[01:03:00]  How about maybe it rained and there was a puddle on the roof of some building and wind blew and some of that water was carried and landed on you.  How about air conditioning systems which leak condensation all over the city?  Sometimes you'll be walking around and all of a sudden there's air conditioning.  I'm with Spaz.  If he thinks he got leaked on, I'd have to go with him.  Too cold for what?  Air conditioning?  Everybody got it running. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait.  There's all those buildings that have air conditioning running.  Even in the winter, people use air conditioning.  Yeah.  In buildings.  No, but I mean like the small window units.  I'm not talking even window units.  I'm talking units on rooftops to have condensation.  Right.  That's just one...  That's one thing that's probably more possible.  I'm not saying that's what it is.  But then you got leaked on.  I think you would know if you got leaked on.  Leaked on.  So what?  So now you're angry and you want to vent about people that pee on other people?  Great heights?  I will vent when I take my segment tonight. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  I just want the rage to build up.  Okay.  And you're really pissed off because there was leak all over your hair.  Stupid!  Now because of that...  You're so stupid!  And now because of that, you had to wash your hair three times and it's now poofy.  It gets poofy every time I wash it.  In a related subject, Spaz, that's not moose in your hair.  I am fascinated by this man.  I am stupefied.  Oof.  All right. 
[01:04:30]  Spaz, don't let, you know...  No, no.  Just deter you here.  Do your rant on people that pee on other people in this fair city.  Stranger things have happened.  Hey, eye beams come down on old ladies' heads in retirement apartments in Times Square.  Yeah, so who am I to say no one was taking a leak on Spaz's head?  Yeah.  And he has a warning, too, to his fellow walkers out there, Anthony.  What's the warning?  Well, they'll tell us tomorrow or...  Yeah.  I'm also going to go off on how I get ticked off when I walk the streets of Manhattan because people just don't get out of my way. 
[01:05:00]  And they have to light their cigarette near me.  Light their cigarette near you.  And that's going to be associated with the whole leaking on your head.  You're convinced it's all related, right?  Kind of.  Okay.  Great.  New politics and stocks.  He's as dumb as a box of rocks.  His lips are jacking when he tries to talk. 
[01:05:30]  This is it, the Weekend Review with Spaz.  You dumb f***.  Correspondent Spaz.  Can't wait to hear more tomorrow with Spaz's Weekend Review.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  This just said, people leaking on other people in Manhattan.  Unbelievable the amounts of completely coming in from people being drenched by urine that is being peed onto people's heads from great heights. 
[01:06:00]  You may ask yourself, geez, I can't even hit the toilet bowl when I'm standing in my own bathroom  without hitting the rim and getting it all over the sheet so that the girls complain.  But from 40 stories high above the windy streets of downtown Manhattan,  somebody is peeing on pedestrians. 
[01:06:30]  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  This is an exclusive story.  People being peed on.  This is a new form of terrorism in our Paris city.  Top of all to the World Trade Center bombing.  We now have the World Trade Center peeing.  People are on the observation of the World Trade Center peeing down on people on the West Side Highway.  It's quite amazing.  Let's get this quote from a man on the street that has been peed on. 
[01:07:00]  Sir?  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  You've heard it here first, but it's never going to be a stupid, you're so stupid.  Unbelievable.  How does the streams stay together over 40 stories?  How does wind affect this?  How are they aiming?  We'll have scientists that are educated in fluid technologies on the show later to tell us how this works.  Hey, Tom, are you going to explain the theory of the circle? 
[01:07:30]  The clear sky in the middle of the clouds?  Yes, yes, our own weatherman, Mr. G, will be coming on and explaining the strange phenomenon.  Holes in the sky above Spaz's head.  Unbelievable cloud formations that keep the skies clear above morons' heads happening in our Paris city.  Tom Brogan, I'm between 9 million years. 
[01:08:00]  Tom, maybe it's King Kong taking a leak on everybody.  Oh, I didn't even know that.  We'll send a camera crew right now to the Empire State Building.  God checking in.  God?  Hello, boys.  How are you today?  Pretty good.  Hello, God.  Even God has a bad car phone.  I thought he would get the good one, but I guess not.  Hi, God.  I'm calling to let you know that I peed on Kevin's head, because I cannot even forgive him for being so effing stupid.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  Thank you, God.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hey, look at that, Don.  I wonder if that has any truth to it.  What are we doing over there?  Wait, they want me to push something here.  Oh, really?  All right, I'm pushing.  Anything, Bueller?  Switch out the top, guys.  This is going to help.  Hey, it's funny, Beth. 
[01:09:00]  Keep it in.  Keep it in.  Keep it in.  So fast.  You're so fast.  You're so fast.  Run, run, run.  Run, run.  Run, run.  Run, run.  Run, run.  Run, run. 
[01:09:30]  C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! 
[01:10:00]  This is so fun!  This is so fun!  What?  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha! 
[01:10:30]  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Conbroker on NBC Nightly News.  Ha-ha-ha!  In this segment, Urine from the Sky.  Ha-ha-ha!  in your former terrorism sweeping the city  the young vandals forty stories up  peeing on pedestrians  we'll have mayor  the response to this later 
[01:11:00]  remember that's the big story tonight  the funniest part of that whole thing was it is just a lot like that  rain drop, keep falling in on my head  hahaha  hahaha  there was no wind, I didn't feel anything whistling through my ears  Spaz, you don't seem amused at this point, you okay?  it's a serious subject  very serious  urine  urine-streaming terrorists  high above our city 
[01:11:30]  perhaps even using  enemy aircraft  perhaps not even in buildings  perhaps they're  hiding in the landing gears of airplanes  spaz, out of these three things, tell me which is the most serious, okay?  giant mosquitoes attacking our fine city  yes  cancerous live wires  or people leaking on your head as you're trying to walk to work  which would be the most serious of the three?  I would have to say the cancerous live wires 
[01:12:00]  okay  cancerous live wires!  alright  by the way thank you for the cancerous live wires window decals  that someone said  yeah, you see that?  it's got cancerous live wires  and then the red circle with the slash throw  we've been getting a pretty good laugh out of those  so thank you for sending those into the show  we'll probably have them at our next road show, a few of those  alright, what would be the second most serious out of the three?  I would have to say the mosquito  giant mosquito  alright  and then so leaking on your head really doesn't seem that bad 
[01:12:30]  it's more of a moral matter  there it is  Colonel Tibbetts in the Enola J  flying above the city of New York  a fusillage  belly  laden with urine  spraying it down  on unsuspecting pedestrians  this could bring an end to the law  Colonel Tibbetts rolling down the runway  the implement of destruction  tanks and tanks of urine  in her belly  oh my god 
[01:13:00]  hey Lowe, what's up?  oh god  you're killing me  now I know why you keep Spaz on  no one that stupid can be allowed to run out into the public  it's amazing  oh my god  I can't believe how dumb the guy is  Spaz, did you ever hear of something called a sun shower?  a sun shower  and what is a sun shower?  a sun shower is  guys, the guy is unbelievable  you know what I think  I think the mosquitoes following him around 
[01:13:30]  alright Lowe, thank you  oh man  okay, sun shower  sun shower  a sun shower is when there are very little white clouds  I believe they're the cumulus clouds  or the stratos  they're around the sun  and  what?  what?  what?  wait a minute, the clouds are where?  around the sun?  around the sun?  it looks like that  from a bucket  it's not really  how far from the sun would you say these clouds are?  I would  I really don't know 
[01:14:00]  I would just say eons  eons?  eons is a time frame  not a distance  that's not the Chevy Chase reference, you idiot  I didn't know that  you're ripping off Chevy Chase  I didn't know  that guy's going to come in here and beat you out  so now, a sun shower  you look up  and  are you saying  that you see clouds  when there's a sun shower?  yes  but they're  but they're whitish  not so grayish clouds  but  but  but  the shower  the shower that there was  there was a center  where there was just a blue sky 
[01:14:30]  so it can't possibly rain  from a blue sky  wow  of course it can  it's blue  there's nothing  there's no clouds  to rain  oh my god  oh my dear sweet Jesus  this is impossible  he walks and breathes  so there's got to be something in there  at least for  involuntary actions  is there  is there just like a medulla  doesn't  isn't that just control  like heart rate 
[01:15:00]  and breathing  to make sure you just don't drop dead  people can live without brains, right?  people live in hospitals  and breathe and live quite  quite well  but they're brain dead  brain dead people can still breathe  thank you Steve  I was very curious  as to that  oh my god  dude  it is totally possible  for it to be sprinkling on you  when you look up  and see complete blue skies  and sun  just shining  how?  where's the rain coming from?  it can't be coming from the sun 
[01:15:30]  it could  yes it can  no no  it can rain  first of all  it could be from clouds  that you are seeing  way away from you  the winds are bringing  the water to you  winds aloft  also water  what am I going to ask?  also water can just  condense in the air  without forming clouds  or it could be blue ice  from those jets  flushing their toilets  so maybe you're right 
[01:16:00]  you did get some  urine on your head  whoa  okay  and I said  I didn't like the way  you got the baby  don't fuck  don't fuck  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  I didn't hear that

[01:17:00]  I gotta tell you  I was outside  having a cigarette break  today  and I looked up  and out of a clear  blue sky  I'm getting spritzed on  and now I realize  there was a construction  site close by  and I was probably  being spritzed with  urine  see  I mean  you know  I'm glad that he  exposed this  because now I know  to be careful  when I'm walking  the streets of  Manhattan  well he's gonna have  some advice  for all you people  tomorrow on this  I can't wait  to hear it  okay  take care  bye bye  well there you have it  deadly urine throwing

[01:19:30]  that's falling  from the sky  I believe  you're exercising  enough to keep  that weight off  well maybe  you're not lucky  enough to have  people urinating  on you  maybe you don't  have a clue  that that's  what's going on  down there  in the streets  of New York  or maybe it  hasn't happened  yet you're  kind of a big  person with  more area  a bigger target  for those  urine flinging  madmen from  40 floors above  your head  so what do you  want to do  you want to  make yourself  as small a target 
[01:20:00]  as possible  right  from the head  down  do you want  to look like  a big round  circle  no  from 40 floors  up from the  urine flinging  terrorist  no I believe  that would be  an easy target  right  Stacker 2  will help you  avoid being  peed on  a new thing  what are the  four things  Stacker does  oh we're adding  the fourth  huh  it's four things  now  I think I know  three out of  the four  okay  I believe it  burns the fat  because it's  called the world's  strongest fat  right  I believe it  crushes the  cravings to  snack in  between  meals  that's true  and gives  your boost 
[01:20:30]  of energy  during the day  when you're  feeling sluggish  sorry  that's true  and brand new  just added  number four  yeah  makes you a  smaller target  so you won't  get peed on  there you go  Stacker 2  give them a call  no one will  hit you with  number one  when you take  Stacker 2  is that their  new slug line  I like that  it is now  okay  Stacker 2  the world's  strongest fat  burner  give them a  call  1-800-LITELINE  that's  1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E 
[01:21:00]  for Stacker 2  alright  we're back  with the  Opie and Anthony  show  Steven Lynch  on the way  to perform  two brand new  songs for us  today  also  I'm patiently  waiting for the  audio from the  Jay Moore fight  we want to get  some of that  on today  yeah  they're talking  about it in  the daily news  today  oh my god  we'll see  what happens  with that  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7  you know  we were going  to go into  our comments 
[01:21:30]  about  Ili√°n  Gonz√°lez  Ili√°n  down there  in Miami  Miami  Cuba  that whole  situation  heating up  again  and we  were going  to discuss  that  but all  of a sudden  we had  to talk  about the  urine  falling from  the sky  of course  I can't  wait for  part 2  of that  tomorrow  when he  gets his  thoughts  really together  unbelievable  it's Cubans  peeing on it  I swear  Frank from  Manhattan  writes on  the instant  feedback 
[01:22:00]  O&A  whoa  Spaz never  disappoints  does he  how the hell  does he  find his way  to the station  every day  does he  leave a trail  of bread  crumbs  or what  I tried  that but  the birds  I got  long  alright Frank  let's get  into some  real news  now  hard hitting  news  Ileon  Gonzalez  I mean  what more  is there  to be said  about this  everyone's  got their  opinions  send them  back  keep them  whatever  the case  may be 
[01:22:30]  what I  saw  when I  was watching  the news  was a  plane  fly into  Miami  or Texas  I guess  they brought  him to  and the  door opened  up and  like a  clown car  at the  circus  more Cubans  came piling  out of this  plane  the father  comes out  with another  kid in his  arms  they're trailing  other kids  behind him  he's got an  entourage  with him  I just want  to pose a  question to  you  let's say 
[01:23:00]  you have a  cockroach in  your house  right  how do you  get rid of  it  do you  invite more  cockroaches  in your  house  no that  would not  be the  thing to  do  Jesus  I'm not  saying Cubans  are cockroaches  open  but are you  trying to  say that  more Cubans  will be  entering our  country  because of  this  Ileon  Gonzalez  first of  all because  one kid  that they're  debating whether  they send  him back  or keep  him  because there  was one  kid  in Miami  there has  to be  now about 
[01:23:30]  50 more  Cubans  in this  country  they keep  flying him  in  I swear  to god  this father  showed up  with more  kids  do you  think he's  leaving  and just  like the  cockroaches  they're waiting  for the light  to turn on  so they can  run and  hide  oh they  scatter  they go  right into  the molding  you never  see him  again  it's our  chance to  send him  back  we need  the Orkin  man  come in  and do  some spraying  I don't know  what it is  but I think  we're making  a grave error  because I  believe these 
[01:24:00]  people if they  want to  they can  stay  if they want  some kind  of asylum  they are  allowed to  stay  they're  just waiting  till the  whole family  comes over  they're in  Cuba saying  oh send  the kid  back  send him  back  so they  build up  this whole  thing  then they  say well  I want  to go  there to  fight  to get  my child  back  they send  him here  and then  all of a  sudden  they're like  oh we're  staying  oh we're  staying  this place  is beautiful  I got  here  they gave  me  brand new  sneakers  cool t-shirts 
[01:24:30]  concert t-shirts  they gave me  toy guns to  play with  a playstation  playstation  I'm staying  and that's the  father talking  he's real  happy about  the toys  they're giving  him  hey Kim  what's up  what's up  how are you  good how are  you  talking to  you on  the air  you don't  have your  thoughts  right  why  because  Elian's  father came  into  Washington  D.C.  good morning  not Dallas  well they flew  into Texas  first  what was that  they flew  into Texas 
[01:25:00]  first and  they took  him to  Washington  today  he entered  the country  through Texas  yeah  oh he did  okay  I didn't know  that  okay  all right  she's trying  to trip  me up  I'm a  responsible  journalist  not like  spaz  okay  well he  wasn't sure  either  so I guess  that's why  he had to  find out  well they  had to  land in  Texas  first before  they jumped  to D.C.  because they  had to  change from  a plane  to a giant  mosquito  to avoid  the cancerous  live wires  and so the  mosquito could  zigzag in  and out of  buildings  lest they  be peed  on  okay guys 
[01:25:30]  thank you  Kim  let's go to  Mike  Mike you're  next on  NEW  hey you know  once his  father gets  a little  welfare and  free money  that's what  it is  they know  they know  when they  come over  here and  take a look  around  they go  oh my god  you know  they're used  to Cuba  and they  don't really  get very  accurate news  about the  rest of  the world  in Cuba  so they  don't know  that there's  much different  in the world  they get here

[01:36:30]  wacky  with Cuba  and I'll tell you  something  what happens  in Cuba  too  the father  has been  flown over  here  but I can  guarantee you  if Fidel Castro  let him fly  here  it's because  he said  well your  friends are  hostage  your family's  hostage  and if you  don't return  they're going  to all have  a bullet  in their  head  no they'll  all be  over here  no they won't  they're still  in Cuba  yeah for the time  being  what's left over  there a cousin  a third cousin  and a family  friend  I think that's it  from his family  they're all here  in Miami  well if he was  sent here  believe me 
[01:37:00]  he's been  threatened  to come back  or the consequence  he's just hoping  Castro drops dead  before they have  to fly back  how many years  does that old  bastard have  hopefully not long  he's still dressing  in his military  uniform  he's what  is he 90 years  old now  like he's going  to lead the charge  and hopefully  you guys are going  to take me up  on I offer to  do a beautiful  lingerie show  on your show  oh yeah  and send you  my press kit  hopefully you'll  take it  take into  consideration  you got nice  bongos  beautiful

[01:38:30]  is that true  though  there can't  possibly be a  neighborhood  in our fine  city that  has all the  signs in Spanish  probably  I wouldn't doubt  it  really  like the street  signs  yeah  I wouldn't doubt it  I'm not talking  about advertisements  or billboards  or whatever  street signs  yeah  like the stop  sign doesn't say  stop  what is stop  in Spanish  it says  alto  no that's height  I think  el stop  el stop  what is stop

[01:43:00]  back on the  show  he lives  you take such  long breaks  from our  radio show  we're convinced  that your  management  finally talked  into not  ever showing  up on our  show again  I think people  get a little  sick of me  so I try to  stay away  for a couple  weeks at a  time  according to  Billy and  Paul you  weren't showing  up because  Jay is on  our show  a lot  and Jay  showed you  his ass  and you  didn't want  to come  on the  show  oh that's  not even  a joke  that's what  was said  during the  whole fight  show  that is  100%  true  can you  blame me  for that  I'm trying 
[01:43:30]  to defend  Jay at  that point  going what's  the big  deal  seeing  another  guy's  this never  makes sense  when you're  trying to  explain it  but I  think we've  all walked  into a  weird situation  where one  of your  pals is  just being  a complete  idiot  well no  that was  actually the  only time  I was agreeing  with Billy  Paul the other day  I agreed  well the story  goes  this was in  Boston  right  Jay  invited you  up to  his room  or something  because you  guys  were going to  go meet  no we met  the next day  to go get  something to eat  and walk  around Boston  so we get to 
[01:44:00]  the front desk  and Tyke and I go  yeah we're here to  see Jay  and they go  alright  they call his  room  go right on up  he's up there  we walk down the  hallway  I hear the door  go  oh he's opening  the door for us  that's really nice  walk in  there he is  hands and knees  ass akimbo  oh my god  so we just  walked right by  and we didn't  even say anything  it's like what  you didn't like  my joke  Jesus man  it was funny 
[01:44:30]  I gotta give it  to him  alright  I barely knew  the guy  that's what  made it so funny  so did you hear  the fight  yes  the Jay  fat guy  fight from  two days ago  it was pretty  good  I was just  telling the guys  I was in the  studio  I was in the  recording studio  I'd run downstairs  and I'd go  especially  is that a take  is that a take  and I'd run back  upstairs and listen  to the radio  you were a little  flat on that  I don't care  it's a take  I gotta get back  to the own age  I can't miss this  seriously  it was insane 
[01:45:00]  radio  it was unreal  I didn't bring  anybody with me  am I safe here  oh yeah  we're trying not  to have any more  brawls in the studio  are you gonna be  turning on us  too  Stephen  yeah  I was thinking  about it  you know  I don't get  any respect  that's what you  gotta say  you don't get  any respect  it's terrible  how long were you  waiting out in the  waiting room  yeah that seems to be  a concern with the  members of our show  and that's ridiculous  you know something  maybe I agree with  two things  anyone else that  comes on this show 
[01:45:30]  is whisked right in  Billy and Paul  I swear there were  times when they got  here at probably  four o'clock  and sat  the show was over  we were like  oh gee  ran out of time  and like  he was sitting  there for three  hours  and then a  stupid kid  with a wow  sign  they made  on like  the ten o'clock  news  he's like  rushed in  like Michael  Jackson  on one of the  rides at Disney  right in front  of the line  that was some  wild wild radio 
[01:46:00]  man  that was  yeesh  I wanna hear it  again  well we got  yeah we got  some clips  man  I can't wait  to hear some  of them  we're gonna  try to get  them  have you replayed  it at all  no not at all  I'm curious to  hear how it  sounded  because Ed and  I were just  dumbfounded  we're just like  is this really  happening in front  of our eyes  so Billy was  down at  or Paul was  down at  Rascals  last night  what last night  Jeff Norris  in the studio  last night he  showed up  Jeff who took  a punch  trying to keep  the two party parties 
[01:46:30]  away from each other  and where did  Jeff take the punch  right ear  how's your ear  it's fine  ear E-A-R  that's what I said  that's what I said  your ear  so the doctor  had to poke your ear  and suck out  some fluid  he stuck it in  sucked it out  he left the show  to get his  ear  a little drainage  so you were  at this point  in front of  Jay  Jay Moore  Jay Moore  was behind you  and you got a fist 
[01:47:00]  in your ear  that's interesting  I tried to talk  him out of it  in the elevator  I'm like  you know  you got your  whole career  ahead of you  he's like  you know  Norris  look I like you  but don't eff  with me  and this and that  and we're going  back and forth  and I'm like  what am I going to do  then he ran down  there and  someone pounded  your ear  no as soon as he saw  I think  well that was after  was there a lot  of dried blood  on the hair  of your ear  in little ball form  yeah  it was nuts 
[01:47:30]  that old gag  that never gets old  yeah so he was down  there though  Paul was down  because I think  there's a rift  between Paul and  Billy now  down where  down at the  Rascal  yeah last night  he showed up  so Paul was down  there and how's  he looking these  days  I went off  10 pounds  I walked back  into the green room  to see Jay  and I walked  back there  and I saw  the owner Mark  and I was talking  to him  and I walked  in and Paul  he looked like 
[01:48:00]  a skeleton  like maybe someone  took like toilet  paper and wet it  and put it around  a bone  not as much flesh  he has left  on his body  oh my god  really  if airsick  doesn't work out  he should go on  for like hair club  for men  because he's  balding in my ass  oh my god  what happened  he hasn't slept  he has big  bad eyes  he's all  his chest  is concaved  and shaken  shaking like a leaf  what  oh my god  what was he doing  there  I walked back  to him  like alright  I'm going to see  Jay  I get to meet  like my 
[01:48:30]  all time  favorite football  player  Wayne Crabette  I'm looking forward  to meeting him  he's an awesome guy  I walk back there  I'm walking  and walking  all of a sudden  I see Paul  with his hands  in his pocket  like he has  scoliosis  bent over  he stares at me  and he goes  he stares at me  he goes  hey  hi Jeff  and I went  Christ  and I turned  my back  and I walked out  and he's like  wait  don't go  and I walked away  and finally  you're the owner  of Mark  from Rassels  and he goes  Jeff  just go back  and talk to him  because he's all  and I went back 
[01:49:00]  and he's like  look  I felt bad  for the guy  was he just  hanging out there  waiting for somebody  to tell his side  of the story  no I think  he wanted to try  to clean a slate  with Jay  I think he felt bad  about what happened  I mean  a fat guy  wasn't there  but I'm sure  he's not anorexic  he's down to 360  yeah  he's wasting away  a mere shell  of his former self  as Otto and George  would say  he's wasting away  to a warehouse  aww look  I'm not stealing  my material  you're ripping off  Otto and George 
[01:49:30]  on the radio  you're doing it  on the radio  on the radio  I plug that  I plug that  I would never do that  but he looked terrible  and then Jay made it  short and sweet  Paul's like  lift Jay  I just wanted  to come down  and he's like  you said you're  P's and Q's  now I gotta do  a show now  screw  and that was it  Paul hit in the back  for the whole show  for fear that  someone in the audience  might  I think they kinda  oh my god  really  hey there he is 
[01:50:00]  boys  let's get him  pitchforks and torches  he was nuts  wow  towards the end  I think Jay  came a little more  if I should use  the word forgiving  or not  but they kinda  they shared some  of my chicken wings  so that's a good  oh look at that  so you know  how nice  Paul's like  how's your ear  I'm like  how's your ear  yeah it's fine  it's feeling good  oh yeah  alright a little update 
[01:50:30]  from Rascals there  we're gonna replay  the audio soon  by the way  that Rascals show  the two that I attended  were amazing  yeah he packs them in  and just kills  he packs them in  and you know  Dina Cola  would get up there  at the beginning  of the show  and go  who here is  listens to O&A  and the whole crowd  just nuts  nuts  nice  every time he made  a show reference  in his set  yeah  so you're saying  Jay was ripping us off  he was stealing material 
[01:51:00]  well you know  I don't want to say anything  but I'm here  right  so Lynchy  what are you up to  I hear you're in the studio  yeah  my album's almost done  it's gonna be  it's gonna be kick ass  I think  very good  18-19 cuts on it  and some  some little things  here and there  little surprises  and stuff  hopefully I'm working  on one big surprise  but I'll let you guys  know about that later  I think it could be good  FBA  FBA 
[01:51:30]  FBA  FBA  FBA  FBA  FBA  FBA  FBA  and all the world's  most offensive songs  we hear you have been  coerced into performing  FBA  I give up  full blown AIDS  I gave up  you denounced the song  you've tried to steer clear  of it  but you've been performing it  I did  I did  at Rascal  look the crowd  would have killed me  if I didn't  plus I had Dina Cola  there to write down  the words  and hold them up  it's all you  he did write the words  you merely wrote the music  what an amazing contest 
[01:52:00]  though  this most offensive song contest  yeah  I can't believe it  it's really taken on  a life of its own  some of this stuff  we don't want to be  connected to some of the songs  that are coming in  and it's so hard  to just  when are you going to  pick a winner for this thing  because you know  that's going to end the contest  yeah but we just milk it  8,000 entries  there was one  we were listening to  in the back room  we can't even play  on the radio  because it would need  so many bleeps  it would take away  from the song  didn't you hear us  discussing it 
[01:52:30]  no  you know the famous song  Fox on the Run  by Sweet  yeah  Fox on the Run  alright  what rhymes with Fox  with a C  alright ok  very good  so it's  on the Nun  that's great  it's hilarious though  you can't play it  just because of the one word  well no  there's so many curses  it's just so  so tell the guy  to redo it  and take some of that out  and just leave it  we got to play it  at least once  you want to play 
[01:53:00]  with all the bleeps  maybe  play it  with all the bleeps  I know  I know  but  I'm the guy  he really did a good job  with the song  yeah  in the 6 o'clock hour  in the 6 o'clock hour  possibly  alright  you want to hear  one of the songs  we got yesterday  Stephen Lynch  before we  before we get into  the two brand new songs  you brought us today  which are not  anywhere near as offensive  as these things  thank goodness  he's got three of them  who  you have three songs  to play today  maybe  no I didn't tell you three  you told me  you were going to play  hey no fighting 
[01:53:30]  whatever  hey brawl  come on  yeah  wait wait  ow my ear  I'll have to walk  Stephen out now  alright  well let's play  this one from yesterday  and then we're going  to come back  with Stephen Lynch  and a couple new songs  maybe three  I don't know  whatever you want to do  we don't want to  piss off any more  of our regulars  we're running out  of regulars  at this time  everyone  everyone's egos  getting in the way  on the stupid radio show  alright Ant 
[01:54:00]  this is Q  from yesterday  yes  done to the song  Imagine by John Lennon  have you heard this one yet  I'm ashamed to say  I have heard it  and I laughed heartily  wait I have to say  something before you play this  when I left yesterday  yeah  as you know  I brought my radio  because I wanted to listen  to this song  I'm in the elevator  back room  you know  and I have it up  at a relatively  high rate  so he goes  imagine there's no  yeah  bad word  who happens to walk  out of the elevator  but one of these  people from this race  and I'm going 
[01:54:30]  oh my god  I'm going to get  another fight  I can't come to the show  he goes  you know  you ought to lower  your radio  it's pretty offensive  he did say that  oh wow  well it is pretty bad  but it is  in the most offensive  song contest  I said I'm sorry  my name is Paul  from Airsec  yeah  well the song  starts off  a little lopsided  but then I think  he takes care of  a lot of different  areas  right Anthony  oh yes  it's a virtual love fest  after the first few lines  yeah sure  a couple new ones  from Stephen Lynch 
[01:55:00]  on the way  but first it's Q  the latest entry  in the most offensive  song contest  me  forget about  imagine  there's no  friggin niggas  imagine  there ain't no  friggin jiggle boos  no mulling yarns  and no spooks  there ain't no  big scary darkies  running around 
[01:55:30]  out there  and of course  no friggin arabs  no hindus  no spooks  and no friggin  blutes  imagine  nothing but  friggin  the pound  every friggin  way you go  mud on  it would be great  eh  imagine  there's no  homos  I hate those  little fudge  packing  Nancy  boy  bricks  little mud on  every time I

[01:58:00]  Lenny Bruce  I think  I think  so  what do you  say  after something  there's nothing  you can say  that's a contender  all right  listen  we gotta  take a  break  and we'll  talk to  Steven Lynch  some more  and get a  couple songs  out of them  brand new  songs  we'll do  that next  stay there  the  radio  chick  the underlying  competition  is so important  for parents  to prove  their kid  is really  truly special  three million  sperm were shot  only one  minute  now the  other two  million  nine hundred  ninety 
[01:58:30]  thousand  and change  were so  valuable  that they  were thrown  away  now think  about it  entire  seeds  of countries  are wiped  up almost  every night  at Butch's  house  with a  dirty  gym  dig  the  chick  middays  10 to 2  on 1027  WMEW  some days  you know  we're a  lap ride  and other  days we just  flat out  suck  we know  it  interesting  and true  hopefully  we have  them  today  1027  WMEW

[01:59:30]  Lynch's career  Anthony  yes  we're happy  that he's  showing his  face on our  show today  yeah  it's good to  be back  we get a little  paranoid when  he takes a month  away from the  radio show  we're convinced  that his people  around him  are convincing  him that we're  the antichrist  yeah we're  thinking maybe  maybe he's  going to come  in here and  start fighting  kickin' ass  brawls  do you people  ever say  anything nice  about us  they love it  when I come  on the show  okay good  dude my show  is at Rascals

[02:01:00]  yeah  no fight  it's great  we like when  the people  I'm a peaceful  guy  that are part  of our show  don't yell  at us  it's greatly  appreciated  no fighting  OP  that clip  that clip on  foundrymusic.com  of him yelling  is priceless  you do  his head's all  red  he's like  screaming  he's pointing  at both of us  with both hands  you're not a comedian  oh my god  you're not a comic  if you were a comic  you'd know  as he just like 
[02:01:30]  and then  and then  like  the split second  it hit him  like oh my god  what am I doing  guys  please  I  went like  no  you guys didn't hear  what I just heard  I've been editing  this  this mess  the last hour  yeah  oh  you  when he starts  yelling at you  you are like  the people that  you're like  the person that  no matter what  you say to them  you can't get them  you're just like 
[02:02:00]  that doesn't bother me  that doesn't bother me  it's like  you're not touching me  I'm not touching you  I'm not touching you  it is the funniest  freaking thing  I know you are  but what am I  exactly  that's what you  expect  but that's what  you gotta do  it is so funny  you can't show  the person  they're getting to you  you know  it is just  because it pisses  them off  that they  they're not getting  to you  I don't think  they were getting  to you  no not at all  say what you want  I could care less  god it's so funny  though how  like everybody  thinks that  not everybody 
[02:02:30]  they think  that um  everybody should  just be treated  the same  on this show  what is this  a democracy  no  it's our show  some people get  right in  some people have  to wait  it's just  the way it is  sorry  four hours  four hours  well yeah  maybe not that long  well what  what are you  going to do  well you want  to play a couple  tunes Stephen  Lynch  sure  brand new  songs  well this one  isn't brand new  but Rick  says that I've  never played it  on the show  he heard it  the other day 
[02:03:00]  so  I'll play it  for you  is it going  to be offensive  no  compared to  the other songs  I mean please  oh my god  I couldn't even  try to top  those things  all right  Stephen Lynch  the show  is yours  couple little  short songs  you hear that  yeah I hear it  fine  there we go  I had to see you  one last time  there's something 
[02:03:30]  on my mind  how do I say  what needs to be said  the words are  hard to find  how about  bitch  give me my money  I want my money  and I want it fast  hey bitch  give me my money 
[02:04:00]  else I'm about  to take it  out your ass  Stephen Lynch  we'll play that  a hundred times  a little tiny thing  that's funny  I had a song  that  I shouldn't play  this  you ripped that  off Stephen  you ripped that  off  that's my  wedding song  that's your  wedding song  would have been  I think I tried 
[02:04:30]  to play this one  for you guys  once and I  edited the  entire thing  I thought maybe  it would be  a most offensive  song  contender  but after hearing  those other songs  there's no way  what we edited  the whole thing  with the new  regime in place  yeah this is a  few months ago  I think we were  at commercials  when you played  it live  oh  really  are they going  to dump out  of this  oh okay 
[02:05:00]  yeah I kiss you  on the cheek  good night  my love  I say  you turn to me  and smile  the baby's  on the way  and then you  drift asleep  to dream of life  the new  and I lie  wondering  just what  I should 
[02:05:30]  do  I could  kick you  in the stomach  and catch you  unawares  I could swear  to God  you accidentally  fell that  flight of stairs  when I tell you  that I love you  I will look you  in the eye  I guess I'm not  the fathering type  of guy  that's all I got  on that one too  oh wow  so you can see  for a minute  I thought it might  be a contender  and then  it just got  blown away 
[02:06:00]  I can't  that's pretty good  can't compete  with that one  if you threw  a couple of lines  about the colored  in there  oh come on  oh  Jesus  I apologize  hey  someone's asking  when is the  Comedy Central special  because you taped  that recently right  yeah  I taped it  a couple of weeks  ago  they start airing  at the end of June  and I think mine  will be up in early July  but I don't 
[02:06:30]  they haven't told me yet  so  alright  that was fun  that was a good show  Rick was there  with this wife  was it good  that was great  was it  I'm like  sweat  that sucked actually  I thought you were  sweating at the point  of the wife  no that wasn't my wife  oh my god  she didn't go to that  that was her  come on 
[02:07:00]  come on  what  I'm on a tune  here  we can't tell  alright  shall we do one more  here  yeah  alright  why not  I'll do one more  this one's for the kids  the kids out there  yeah because  you guys know  that I do a lot  of elementary schools  I do 
[02:07:30]  I like to come in  sing some cute little  songs to the kids  sure  one thing I feel  is that  I really need to  stress to the kids  that they can be  anything they want  when they grow up  and I tell them  no I'm serious  they can be doctors  or lawyers  and I say  it's fun to use  your imagination  so I tell the kids  that they can  they can be a superhero  if they want  oh very nice  any kind of superhero  they want  they can even make up  their very own superheroes  okay  so I play this  this is for all the kids  seriously if there's 
[02:08:00]  kids listening  it's just for them  this is really not  for adults  if I could be a superhero  I would be  awesome man  I'd fly around the world  fighting crime  according to my  awesome plan  and if I saw criminals  trying to lie  hurting other people  and making them cry  I'd haul them off to jail  in my awesome van  cause I would be  awesome man 
[02:08:30]  yeah  then I say kids  now you know  we all know  that when people  offer you drugs  and alcohol  like me  you just say no  right  if I could be  a superhero  I would be  a drug free boy  telling the world  of the evils  of drugs  and all of the lives  they destroy  well I take  all the junkies  getting so high  with their needles  and bongs  and their sticks  made of Thai 
[02:09:00]  as I burn them alive  I would squeal  with joy  cause I would be  drug free boy  if I could be  a superhero  I'd be  immigration dude  I'd send all the  foreigners back  to their homes  for eating up  all of our food  and taking our welfare  and best jobs 
[02:09:30]  to boot  like landscaping  dish washing  picking our fruit  I'd pass a lot  of laws  to get rid  of their brood  cause I'd be  immigration dude  I'd have the kids  imagine what superhero  they would be  they could be  any superhero  if you could be  a superhero  would you be  justice guy  making sure people  get what they deserve  especially women  who lie  like if a wife 
[02:10:00]  left her husband  with three kids  and no job  to run off  to Hawaii  with some doctor  named Bob  you could skin them  and drain them  of blood  so they'd die  especially Bob  then you would be  justice guy  or you could be  more subtle  I didn't mean  to be vague  give her  the mad cow disease  let him die  of the plague  as long as they  suffered for their  horrible life  especially Bob  then you would be  justice guy 
[02:10:30]  yes then  you would be  a superhero  hero like me  Steven Lynch  there you go  that one's for the kids  I like that  that's cute  you could just  picture them all  running around  like they're flying  listening to the song  with their cute little  blankets  costumes on  yeah a little cape

[02:25:30]  no  yeah  we're waiting for more money  no just kidding  it's gonna be shown in jerry mcguire 2  but let's get right into it all right  yeah  uh billy and paul from  from airsick.net  taking on jay moore two days ago  this is how it all began  all right let's uh let's get billy and paul in here  fat guy  yeah  billy hein and paul pond from airsick.net  they have a problem with uh jay moore  airsick productions  airsick.net  you need chairs  which one's the fat guy 
[02:26:00]  take a guess  uh oh  gee hard to figure that one out  hey paul  hey jay  what's up man  well i'm putting a real screwed up position  first of all  i'm a little pissed with o and a  what happened  well what happened  jeez  every time i try  i tell you guys  something  off the air  it's gonna wind up on the air  that's our show  yeah  we do it all the time  that's right  what'd you tell us off the air  what'd you tell us off the air 
[02:26:30]  let's get into it  that i'm  i got a problem with jay  right  and so you gotta  you gotta bring it up on the air  well i'll tell you why we brought it up on the air  cause you're  you're not wrecked  you affected our show one day  so we're like  what the hell was that about it  we're pissing ourselves that  we didn't say something  when jay was live from l.a. on the phone  well hold on  how did we wreck the show that day  by not saying nothing  i didn't say  you kinda wrecked the segment  that's for sure  i thought we were  the day the amadou diallo verdict came out  ooh  funny dimes  wait a minute  i thought we were more  talking about what billy was saying 
[02:27:00]  and had no problem talking about  i don't  did we say  that you had no  i know what they're talking about  we mentioned the fact  they were in here  wait wait wait wait  they mentioned the fact  when we were doing the amadou diallo verdict  yeah  you know  these guys were in right  and we were  they were hanging on the show  and then jay out of nowhere  calls from l.a.  we put him on  he's making everyone laugh  and while jay's making everyone laugh  you guys were sitting there  with the same faces you got now  with your arms folded  he wasn't making us laugh  and that affects my show  or our show i should say  he wasn't making us laugh 
[02:27:30]  why wasn't he making you laugh  no he wasn't  so i was pissed at myself  that i had the perfect opportunity  to at least confront the issue  because jay was from l.a.  live from l.a.  and you guys obviously had some type of beef with him  and i  and to be honest  we blew it  we didn't say anything on the air that day  so then yes we did bring it up on the air  yeah so then you had to drag it up again  i was  i call up just to make a joke  saying it's going to be gay more week  blah blah blah  and then a whole cool chick  i said she changed the name to 
[02:28:00]  because she wanted to be little hoe  right  and and then you  you had to  bring a whole  whole thing out about jay  but paul  paul  in all fairness  at that point  you guys have  mentioned it enough  that it's time to see what the problem is  well i'm confused  because the last time i saw you  i was taking pictures  like with you and your girlfriend  and your family  and then you stick your head in  and you're like screaming at everybody  well  i'm getting  i got pressure from other comedians  all right  when i was on the show  um  and i was  you know 
[02:28:30]  you had a perfect opportunity  to say something about jay  and you didn't take the opportunity  to say it  and  and quite frankly  i'm nervous about this  why would you  because i wouldn't say something about you  because i would think we were aligned  i know  especially when i heard that you said  something nice about me on friday  and i'm like well  i know something  you know  this sucks  you know that  this really sucks  but you know  no  it's just  it comes down to  like every week  we do  sorry  we do stuff for you guys 
[02:29:00]  and it's like  you know what  oh but look  here's somebody better  screw you guys  we're gonna take the next guy  so it's like  screw you  i think you guys  have gotten  i think you guys  have gotten a ton of air time  on our show  more than any other radio show  in the country  i would guarantee that  you're the only guys  we work for for free too  whatever  yeah  we don't need a  we don't need to pay you guys  we don't need to pay jay more  it's a barter thing  i know that  yeah  you give us  you give us good songs  that we play on the air  i know that  and we give you plugs  it's like a one hand  i know that  i'm just pissed off 
[02:29:30]  that i'm in this position  right now  let me just put my cars in on it  the two of you  i know you were air sick productions  you two are air sick productions  right  okay  we're both air sick productions  okay  by the way  who are all these people with you  you know  they have these guys work here  this is my friend billy  that's dina cola  oh that's dina cola  yeah  the one song wonder  wow  oh man  dina cola wrestled at wisconsin  do i be careful  well  i don't know  i don't think the weights match up  i think you guys are in different weight classes  i mean this is one of the things 
[02:30:00]  you come on and you're like  oh dina cola  dina cola  he's the greatest thing since sliced bread  the guy wrote one friggin song  you take credit for starting a whole contest  you know  blown age isn't just one song  yeah it is  it's one song  that's like the free bird of six songs  what are you talking about  in your opinion  in my opinion  steven lynch was on stage last night  people are  he hit the stage  we give the guy credit  he started the most offensive song contest  we're not talking about that with you guys  we're talking about when jay calls up  it's always like  oh you know  mike dina cola  mike dina cola  mike dina cola  so he's plugging a friend  where's the problem  it's what  the mic's over 
[02:30:30]  mic  there's a mic  there's a mic  there's a microphone over here  mic radio  you gotta do the mic  i said i'm talking to you  you're slamming a bit  i'm slamming the fact  that we gotta bust our ass  when we come in here  to join  oh i mean  oh i'm sorry jay  don't stop short  dina cola's gonna go up your ass  yeah  jay how's your career  just lacking yourself  on to somebody  pardon me  oh my god  how's your career  just lacking yourself  on to somebody  following around the country  like a little bitch  we're getting way off track here 
[02:31:00]  we're getting way off track  the problem is  there are things that jay says  on the air  that aren't his  never have  and never will be  and he uses them in his act  and it's bringing people  into clubs  alright  under false pretenses  and you guys know about it  wait a minute  and i've been told  by other comics  why don't you say something to him  you have the opportunity  what bits  well just tell us  what bits are yours first  and make it easier  wait a minute  do the following words  do the following words

[02:38:30]  right now  we're off the air  oh my god  and there you have it  from two days ago  that was pretty much it  there was some bonus material  in there  you didn't get to hear that  on the air  because we went to the  Van Halen game  a lot of that stuff  didn't even make the air  because of all the  cursing and stuff  yeah they had to  dump out  they kept dumping out  so much  it didn't have any  it didn't make sense  at the end of that  wow  god damn 
[02:39:00]  that was something  what a  what a mess  we have part two  Anthony  okay cool  instead of like  you know  making people  wait through  a stop set  let's get right into it  okay  what are we going to hear  here when Billy  fat guy went outside  and waited for Jay  or is there a lead up  to it or what  this pretty much  picks up as soon  as soon as we get  enough delay back up  that we can go back  on the air  you gotta just turn  on the mics  and it just continues  oh okay  and then they end up  towards the end  you see where it ends up  alright cause near the end  of that what we just played 
[02:39:30]  yeah the Van Halen song  was playing for everybody  in their cars  and that's what we are  hearing in the studio  they hit the big button  that just takes us  completely off the air  and goes to a Van Halen CD  at the transmitter  I never thought we'd see  the day but it happened  two days ago  alright so this picks up  when we got enough delay  to get the show  back on the air  here we go  hey uh  Anthony  we're back on the air  here  oh my god  bring him in  we have  wait wait wait 
[02:40:00]  gotta explain to the listeners  what happened  we ran out of delay  and then we had a melee  uh  trying to keep  uh  that guy and Jay apart  everyone separated  so they went into a Van Halen  I heard  why didn't you let us fight  I wasn't there Jay  all those guys  didn't let you fight  everyone stood between us  there can't be  you can't fight  uh in here  we can wrestle  but that would have been  I fought you in here  that was wrestling  we weren't  that guy got out of his chair  we didn't hate each other 
[02:40:30]  that guy got out of his chair  that fat bastard  that 350 pound troll  got out of his chair  bring him back in Rick  bring him back in  let's fight  let's fight on here  let's have a free fight  on here  no the problem  with this whole scenario  Jay is that  they're not saying  crap in our defense  because I don't want you  because you're wrong  we have  you're wrong  we're wrong  Paul you are wrong  you are wrong  if you were a god damn  comic Opie  you would understand  that when you steal material  and you go on stage  that's not going to hurt me  it's wrong  and in the comedy community 
[02:41:00]  that is wrong  Paul when you say  nobody sticks up for you  or takes your side  no one has confronted you  with anything on our show  you've come in  I'm going to put you guys  on something right now  we've done  okay  how about when I  when you guys were on the air  and it was  Jay Moore  one whole more week  of Jay Moore  that's a joke  you don't ask  that's a joke  you say we don't  that's a joke  what did I just say  what did I just say  when he walked in  I was goofing on how he said  the first thing we said  when he walked in 
[02:41:30]  was the gay stuff  and what did  did Nopi say  welcome to the Jay Moore plug  we'll get to the Jay Moore plug  that's all joking  like I could take it  when he attacks us  and he could take it  when we attack him  because we know  it's not serious  but for you guys  it's real for some reason  we've had conversations  off the air  that is not true  I am not going to  let you call you that  that's BS  that's BS  that's BS  that's BS  like what  I can't take it  I don't know if I can

[02:46:30]  from day one  writing parodies  writing bits  working with them  a lot  I never  I never once  pissed and moaned  and bitched  about not being able  to come in  when I want  on my terms  how I want to come in  when I heard you  the other day man  it really did turn my stomach  I'm not taking Jay's side  I'm not taking Jay's side  I'm speaking  I'm speaking  the thoughts  of most of the people  that are listening to you  right now  I never pissed  and moaned  the way you guys are 
[02:47:00]  how do you know that  I mean how do you know  that you're speaking  the thoughts  of all the people  just look at the phone calls  look at everything coming in  look man  you're entitled to your opinion  it's not an opinion  it's a fact man  it's a fact  the problem here  the problem here is you guys  well Jay what are you just upset about  are you upset because this is your truth  what are you so upset about  we're not upset  shut up  what are you so upset about  that's why I'm upset  I want to know what Jay's so upset about  right now I'm upset  because I couldn't get to you  when you got upset  no but what got you so upset  you want to get to me  what  because you can't handle the truth Jay 
[02:47:30]  because you got out of your chair  and came towards me my friend  you don't like being told  that you're a phony  and a fake  and a thief  that's fine  then what are you so pissed off about  I'm going to tell you  shut your fat job  shut the f*** up  from here to here  to my fingertips  to my shoulder  belongs to me  when you were talking  I didn't care  you came out of that chair  took off your headset  and you started coming towards me  and I'm not going to sit in a chair  and get blasted by some fat bastard  I got out of the chair  to meet you halfway  like a man  and then we got broken up  I've twice since then  tried to come over there  to punch you in your fat 
[02:48:00]  f*** mouth  and everyone around here  is breaking us up  and I noticed something  you call me a back peddler  you're just standing there  no one's stopping you  from coming to me  six people stopping me  from coming to you  six people  and now we're really  making me  one, two  everyone's  everyone's stopping Jay  you're so big  you're a little pissant  this really worked out well  for us open end  yeah thanks for sticking up  we really appreciate it  you guys buried yourself  whatever  I'm in Rascal's tonight everybody  at 830

[02:49:00]  hi  hi  hi  hi  no bloodshed  holy smoke  this is like  when are you going to play  my parodies  you got more meat in this room  you guys said  you guys knew this was going to happen  Jay  Jay  you got 8 freaking bodyguards in here  no effing way  you got 8 freaking guys in here  keeping me from knocking that guy in his ass  they are in here for that  I swear to god  you didn't know this was going to happen 
[02:49:30]  you know where a rascal is  and you know where each entrance is  you wait for me  one on one  I swear to god  before  before  because I got to go to work  because people  wait for me outside the studio  wait for me  wait for me outside  outside the studio  I'll be outside the studio  in about an hour  wait for me outside  look how he yells  when there's 6 people between us  oh my god  and that's how it went down  two days ago  we're back live on the radio  that is just as amazing  the second or third time  isn't that great  I picked up so many 
[02:50:00]  on Thanksgiving  you know  I picked up  pretty good  I picked up so many things  listening back to that man  the adrenaline was flowing  so I wasn't listening to everything  they had to say  man  they were just  out of their freaking minds  boy I don't know  what I was thinking  Billy and Paul  came off like  perfectly sane individuals  listening back to it  with valid points  could that have possibly  been the most ridiculous  argument you've ever heard  in your life  pretty much  yes  I mean when they're  arguing about  chocolate starfish  brother cheerio 
[02:50:30]  brother cheerio  he's stolen  step back  look at what you're  arguing about  step back in  take a deep breath  oh my god  do you know  people in other  countries are dying  all right  they would kill each other  for a real cheerio  and that's only like  that's only like  that's only like  20 minutes of something  that lasted an hour and a half  that's the crazy part about it  and the rest of it  was just intent  as as intense  I think tomorrow 
[02:51:00]  we might have some audio  when Billy was just sitting  outside the Brooklyn Diner  calling uh  calling the show  just  begging  Jay to meet him  on the street  classic  a real  fifth grade  street fight  also  my lunchbox  also  give me my  he-man lunchbox  and Billy would be pissed  if someone stole his lunchbox  yeah but his lunchbox  is his suitcase  well Jay  well Jay ain't gonna be able  to lift his suitcase  lunchbox  also we try to move on  with the show  and the phone rings 
[02:51:30]  and it's fat guy  well I'm out here pussy  waiting for you  and the crowd is just  where are you faggot  where are you you faggot  come on  I'm going down  I'm waiting  I'm waiting  I'm waiting  I'm waiting  Jay's like  I'm just gonna go to the  bantam that's it  then Jay runs like  Carl Lewis to the elevators  yeah cause everyone's  holding him back  they didn't want him  going downstairs  he goes  no no I'm just going  to the bathroom  I'm just going  to the bathroom  he opens the door  he takes like  real saunter  kind of two real  slow steps  and then boom  he runs past the bathroom  he goes to the elevators  but there's a slight  problem in his plan  cause everyone 
[02:52:00]  gave chase  yeah then he hits  the elevator button  they're on him  in the elevator  with him  we've all done that  though  look man  I'm gonna be cool  I'm gonna be cool  look look  gonna be cool  look look  you know  you take two steps  and that  he's all crazy  gets in the elevator  what a madhouse man 
[02:52:30]  nuts  so there's a lot of tape  to go through  obviously  Rick will probably  have some more audio  cause when he's  calling the show  just begging Jay  to come outside  I have to give it  to Fat Guy  it's pretty good  it's kind of  pathetic  but it's really  funny too  when you watch  the video  on foundrymusic.com  and you see Fat Guy  sitting there  like he's on the phone  and Jay comes out  of the revolving door  and it's all on  videotape  and Fat Guy  just like  takes his phone  he sees Jay  he goes  oh well I guess 
[02:53:00]  I'm gonna be fighting  I'll put my phone away  he stands up  and Jay charges at him  he charges back  it was like two rams  go at each other  and then my other  favorite clip is  Rick goes water skiing  it looks like  Fat Guy lunged  after Jay  Rick grabbed his arm  and it didn't even  slow Fat Guy down  Rick is sliding  he's sketching  on the sidewalk  on Fat Guy  on his heels  trying to hold him back 
[02:53:30]  with his look on his face  like wait I'm moving  it was the funniest  damn thing  great clips  yeah  who was  who was Billy  from uh  from two days ago  Billy  yeah what's up guys  you're part of  Jay's entourage  yeah I was there  I was the guy in the back  yeah  okay  but I gotta tell you  listening to this  again man  you know whenever  you get into a fight  like a couple days later  you're real livid  and your heart is pounding  I'm sitting here at home  and I'm like  for those that don't believe  it might be real  let me tell you  I was part of the  water ski team  with Rick  trying to hold back 
[02:54:00]  I'm telling you  that guy's got some motion  but  water ski team  yeah well  and like  like Barry said  he did look like  a bag of onions though  but  just wanted to call  and let you know man  it was really intense  listening to the replay again  and that's only 20 minutes  of an hour and a half  of material there  oh and I'm trying  to download it  on the computer  forget about it  we were trying to do that  last night at Rascals too  but  everyone is pounding  foundrymusic.com  for the video of it  funny stuff  it was great guys  alright thank you Billy 
[02:54:30]  you're welcome  cool  Opie  Joe C  from Elmwood Park  yeah  ONA  Billy and Paul called  they want to plug  a sold out table  of four  at Paisano's  and of course  Billy will be  using up three  of the chairs  oh my goodness  again the email  coming in  if there was any  doubt  who came off  looking very silly  during that whole thing  once again  people just pounding  the guys from AirSync  they buried them  why would you do that  why would you do that 
[02:55:00]  I don't understand  it's like it was done  specifically to  crucify themselves  yeah  unbelievable  and they're sitting there  they can't understand  why Ed and I  aren't defending them  and it's our fault  because they did have  a problem  and we brought it up  so it's our fault  they could have come on  voiced their concern  to Jay  in another way  told us to go  F ourselves  whatever  whatever  the one thing  I mean I'm insulted  that they just think  that we don't have  control of our own  radio show  you know like 
[02:55:30]  oh it's going to be  gay more all week  yeah we just got to  deal with it  you know  like we don't have  the balls to stick up  for ourselves  I'm really insulted  by that  because you know  if we say that  on the air  there's definitely  sarcasm put to it  yeah  and we have no problem  with people coming in here  and taking over  for the day  it makes our jobs easier  Steve Lynch just gave us  what  40 minutes of material  that was 40 minutes  we didn't have to do  anything for  there you go  so we don't care  that's what it's all about  you give us good radio  we give you great plugs  fat guy checking in  he's waiting up on the roof

[02:57:00]  Shucky Green said that  in 72  oh my god  alright we'll be back  stay there  you can I sometimes  like piss me off  ok  1027 WNEW  hey Anthony Paisano  of Mulberry Street  in the heart of Louisville  yes  you'll love Paisano  yes  before we get into the spot  Zeke from Jersey  checking in on  instant feedback  he says  I used the word  starfish today

[03:01:00]  is more offensive  than the lyrics  and this is more  like an exhibition  I think  I think this is like  during in between  periods of the hockey game  when they bring the guy  out and he's got to  shoot the puck  through the little thing  for the car  yeah  this is what this is  I think it's more  about just balancing  out the contest  oh is that it  after your brother's  song yesterday  we figured we better  hit another group  here today  and get the Catholics  yeah  personally offending me  oh is it  oh yeah  yes  very offending  very offending  do we know  who sent this one

[03:08:00]  stuff today  oh really  my stomach was  churning  I heard it all  week and then  to hear it again  yeah  oh the fight  yeah I think  this is too much  stress for Anthony  you know  huh  Anthony  you know  you're going  through litigation  you've got  all this stress  I don't know  if this fighting  is really what  you need right now  you've got enough  fighting in the  courtroom huh  oh that's okay  I don't care  alright  I got nothing  left to lose  keep it light  you guys  it's getting a little  heavy in there  I think you need  to bring some  women back in  we're doing that 
[03:08:30]  tomorrow  alright  oil wrestling  that'll get the  ratings  oil wrestling  okay  you stole that  I'll be  and you wouldn't  know because  you're not a  comment  yeah you guys  picked the wrong  day to come in  today  Jason said  what I learned  from the show  Spaz probably  peed on himself  hey Greg  what's up  hey  how are you  I learned that  sun showers  come from  invisible clouds  around the sun  very good  and those clouds 
[03:09:00]  are eons away  eons away  floating around  the sun  of course  I love that  stuff  alright  I love that  stuff  hey  I know a guy  with the same  name as you  someone very  close to me  alright thank you  Greg  alright bye  let's go to  John  John what did  you learn on  the show today  well I learned  that in order  to get through  Spaz you gotta  lie about your  real name which  is Anthony  okay  and I also  learned that  whenever anything  goes down on  your show  music suddenly  comes on  yeah  yes 
[03:09:30]  when you hear  music on the  Toby and Anthony  show there's  probably bloodshed  yeah you know  something's going  on  not only  not just any  music when you  hear Ain't  Talking About  Love by Van  Halen  we have been  taking off the  air  yeah no intro  either  boom  I know  just right in  the middle of it  alright thank you  take it easy guys  you're great  alright let's go to  Matt  Matt you're next  on NEW  hey how you  doing guys  great  is there any  way we can  get to that  CD player  where is it  would that be  the funniest  damn thing  if we put  like some of  the raunchiest 
[03:10:00]  material we've  ever done  in there  so that no  matter how bad  we get here  they hit the  button and it  goes to  something worse  on the CD  oh no  I was thinking  though instead of  like Van Halen  Ain't Talking  About Love  it's got to be  something really  sappy  like the fight's  going on like  crazy  they take the  show off the  air and all  of a sudden  you hear  and they  called it  puppy love  something really  bad  really sappy  and bad  yeah because  the Van Halen  thing you might  have heard it  here  I think I have  an example of  a real bad  sappy song  so you got 
[03:10:30]  your lighter  okay terrific  and you got  your lighter  ready for the  song tonight  right  yeah  you're gonna  be swaying  back and  forth  okay terrific  yeah  as if by the  14 year old  girl's beer  at the concert  tonight  yeah  chief dates  those 14 year  olds  one beer  and they're  trash  virgin  Anthony  is anybody  there  hey man  what's that  shut up  what  just real  quick  what I  learned  is that 
[03:11:00]  Paul and  Billy lose  all sense  of reality  when under  severe peer  pressure from  their friends  or comedy  friends  they did the  dirty work  for all their  friends that  were complaining  yeah that's  kind of true  and none of  those guys  called in to  stick up for  him  those are  the guys  that should  have stuck  up for him  you know  the funny  thing is  though  like  Paul was  saying  you know  you don't  know what  it's like  in the comedy  community  that's bull  I know  totally what  it's like  and you know  what it is  there's a bunch  of backstabbing  jealous people  in comedy  and they all 
[03:11:30]  talk about  each other  they all  talk about  how this  one stole  from this  one  and the  comedy world  continues to  spin  if Billy  and Paul  wanted to  get on here  and stand  by this  comedy community  they had to  know that  no one was  going to  come and  back them  up  it's over  Johnny  bye bye  no sense  of reality  that's the  first time  I heard  the whole  bit  I freaked  I couldn't  believe  didn't Uncle  Miltie  yell at  people  he was  being yelled  at  years ago  because  he stole  people's
