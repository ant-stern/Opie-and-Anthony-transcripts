<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' typical vulgar and sexually explicit banter, referencing their recurring character "Jimmy Tranny."  They then shifted to discussing their own illnesses – sore throats and coughs – before launching into a raucous, profanity-laced review of the SyFy movie *Sharknado*.  The hosts dissected the film's absurd plot, acting, and surprising cultural impact, focusing heavily on the live-tweeting phenomenon.  They namedropped several actors, including Ian Ziering, Tara Reid, and Robbie Rist (Cousin Oliver from *The Brady Bunch*).  The conversation branched out to other television shows like *Orange is the New Black*, *American's Got Talent*, and *Survivor*, comparing *Sharknado*'s success to other reality TV's relative lack of cultural impact. One host shared a self-deprecating anecdote about a past overweight appearance in an HBO special, before the segment concluded with more vulgar jokes and laughter.

The show then transitioned to a lengthy discussion of the George Zimmerman trial and the subsequent public discourse, particularly on social media. Anthony described his online engagements with those tweeting #JusticeForTrayvon, detailing heated arguments over the case's facts.  The hosts debated the effectiveness of Anthony's actions, questioning whether he was escalating tensions instead of changing minds.  The conversation broadened to encompass racial dynamics in America, perceived biases in the justice system, and differing perspectives within the black community on the case and similar incidents. They referenced other cases, including a Long Island shooting incident, highlighting perceived media and legal inconsistencies. Emmett Till was mentioned in the context of historical racial injustices and his connection to Trayvon Martin's case.  The hosts extensively speculated on the events of the night Trayvon Martin was killed, analyzing evidence and testimony, discussing Zimmerman's potential acquittal based on self-defense laws.  Tom Chiasano, a CBS executive, was mentioned in the context of a previous discussion about racial humor and censorship.

Continuing the George Zimmerman trial discussion, the hosts and an unseen caller speculated on Zimmerman's motivations, questioning his self-defense claim and suggesting possible racial biases. They analyzed Zimmerman's 911 call, pointing out inconsistencies and his language ("assholes," "motherfuckers").  The conversation involved anecdotes about teenage behavior, including the hosts' youthful indiscretions and a nephew's actions. They debated the complexities of self-defense laws and whether Zimmerman's fear was genuine or fueled by racism.  The characters of both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman were discussed, including references to images of Martin holding a gun.  Colin Quinn called in, initially to complain about Jim Norton, but the conversation shifted.  The segment concluded with the introduction of adult film actress Lexi Love and a detailed description and playthrough of the racy board game, "Uncle Don's Exotic Interludes."

The "Uncle Don's Exotic Interludes" game segment featured Opie, Anthony, Sam Roberts, Joe DeRosa, and Mandy Satmiller.  They described and acted out sexually explicit scenarios using vulgar language.  The game involved fines (or sexual favors), advancing to different locations, and completing tasks based on cards.  Notable moments included descriptions of masturbation while driving, a couscous and waiter fantasy, and a listener's account of an encounter with a rapist. Mandy Satmiller shared graphic details from her dating column, including an encounter with a rapist.  The conversation touched upon body image, sex work, and pornography. The show concluded with plugs for Mandy's podcast “News Whore,” and Joe DeRosa’s comedy shows. The after-show briefly discussed Joe DeRosa leaving early, followed by a guest appearance by Pete Dominic, who complimented DeRosa.

The final segment focused on social media, particularly Vine and Twitter, and the conflict between the hosts and Roland.  Joe DeRosa detailed his feud with Roland over Roland's critical Vine videos about DeRosa’s Vines. DeRosa explained his strategy of prioritizing quantity over quality, while Roland's Vines were described as poorly timed and uninspired.  They discussed Roland's impulsive deleting and reposting of similar content. The hosts discussed the pressures of maintaining an online presence, the differences between Vine and Instagram, and Instagram's absorption of Vine's functionality. The conversation also touched on DeRosa's upcoming Philadelphia interview and strained relationships with other radio personalities.  DeRosa expressed uncertainty about why he was excluded from a specific show.  Anecdotes about terrestrial radio and Hooters girls, including a trivia event, were shared.  A reconciliation between DeRosa and Troy was mentioned, ending with a hug. The segment concluded with the hosts acknowledging Roland’s critical and backpedaling behavior on social media and the ongoing conflict.  The language remained frequently profane throughout.

[00:07:00]  that i'm  i'm like  because i never graduated  i have dreams that i  uh  i get another chance  at this age  me  i  to have the radio career  and everything  and i  i still have these dreams that  i'm like  oh they give me a shot  and i have to go into school  go into a class with books  and  fucking do the work  and there are kids around you  yeah  and you're just sitting at like a kid's desk  yeah  it's called being a pedophile  those are pedophiles dreams  and i dreamt the laws were all changed 
[00:07:30]  yes  it was a magical land  that i lived in  in his dream  he gets to ask one of his classmates to the prom  yes  right  make out in the back of his car  no  you know what  it's it's nothing like that  it's nothing sexual or anything  with any of the uh  students  in in these dreams  but uh  it  i never  can  uh  do the work  i'm always fucking up  like i  i'll be in class  i'll be like  oh this is good  and then  like i'll be home  and the next day 
[00:08:00]  i'm supposed to go in  and i'll be like  i'm just not going  like i fuck it up  all over  someone dreams of skipping school  and has dreams where he plays hooky  i play hooky  and i smoke in the boys room  your friends hang up by the railroad trucks  yeah  it uh  yeah it's such a weird fucking thing  and it's  and i know in the dream too  it's like  what am i doing  i got  like the radio show and everything  yeah  what difference does it make 
[00:08:30]  this high school fucking diploma  or something at this point  right  but uh  i always try  i do  i remember like  i remember they did the thing where  uh  they opened the door  and i walked in  and the class was already sitting there  and it's like  i'm the new student  like spicoli  yes  you have a bagel in your pants  there's no party for me here  i did  and i walked in  and  i know that guy  yeah  dude  it's just american history  i see the globe right there 
[00:09:00]  yeah  such a strange fucking  i don't know  i don't get those dreamy things  there's no rhyme or reason to them  no  it's in your head  probably represents the fact  that you're insecure  you don't have a high school  diploma  i don't think so  i don't think it's an insecurity thing  i mean  i've eked out a pretty good uh career  uh without one  right  um  but at this point in my life  like earlier on i did  and i used to have a lot of dreams like that  you know in my 20s and shit  but uh  they just never went away 
[00:09:30]  every so often  they still pop up  and it's like  i don't  i don't give a shit about  a high school diploma  from john h glenn  well maybe you as the  as the young student  represents anthony  and the students represent  the human race  oh  and you realize you can't do the work  i just can't fit in  i can't do the work  emotional work  as a human being  i don't want to be bothered  you know you  you have a good point there  yeah  but um  last night  before bedtime 
[00:10:00]  oh it was all about tv  all about uh sharknado  i saw  now i would love to see  the numbers on this thing  overnight  because i am assuming  it did very well  the sci-fi channel  put out their original movies  you know  they're fantastic  uh but this one  just really for some reason  seemed to  really catch the americans  uh america's attention  well that's what sci-fi does  they always just  they throw shit at the wall  because they know  it's one of these movies 
[00:10:30]  is going to do  what this thing did  they just need to combine  enough things  to write  hit a nerve  get the right combination  and you know  natural disasters  have been a thing  that have  we've all been  looking at  and ever since  like sandy  you know  and the tornadoes  in uh  oklahoma  and all this stuff  well imagine  that kind of disaster  that we're all familiar  with on the news  combined with sharks  sharks  people love sharks  they do shark week  yeah  you know  it's just  it was the perfect combination  because  obviously they've done 
[00:11:00]  their shark things  i mean they've done  mega shark  and fucking two-headed shark  dino shark  dino shark  but there was another one  on the afternoon  right before that  it was a shark one  i think before  right  where the shark  comes on land  yeah i think so  wow  and it has like little  flippers  and it can run  i was watching it  oh wow  it can run on land  was it good  no it was not  it wasn't  picture  see it's like  that one though  people weren't talking  about it  now  tweeting it  live tweeting it  and then  two-headed shark  came on after  a lot of people 
[00:11:30]  bailed out  you know  they had their fill  but uh  but sharknado  wow  that one  we were talking  about it earlier  me and sam  people were live  tweeting this thing  like it was an event  i've never  i try to live tweet  all the stuff  that people live tweet  and i've never  seen the kind of  responses  that i got  and seen the kind  of feed that was  on my twitter feed  of everybody  just hashtagging  sharknado  i loved sharknado  last night  i started getting 
[00:12:00]  text messages  from people  just going  what the fuck  is sharknado  what's sharknado  because it's taking  over people's lives  yes  a lot of people  watching  yeah  a lot of people  watching  all the way  through too  yeah  a lot of people  just watching  right to the  amazing conclusion  what time to start  9 to 11  i think the thing  that struck a chord  with sharknado  is because that  can really happen  well  like a two-headed shark  is ridiculous  that's stupid  sharknado  we could be  attacked by a sharknado  at any point  that's silly  i did 
[00:12:30]  i tweeted something  like like  when when the  actual sharknado  hit and they're  throwing sharks  out all over the place  i was like  now this is ridiculous  and people  now  oh it was  it was perfectly  well before  yes  i get it  it's a joke  don't you understand  what i was talking  about  yeah  yeah so uh  uh sharknado  was uh  amazing  uh the conclusion  with the um  what's his name  from 90210  well this was a big 
[00:13:00]  deal to me  oh yeah  ian ziering  ian ziering  jim do you know  what uh  you know what his  character's name was  in the film  no  he was fighting sharks  yep  his name was finn  finn  ah that's fucking  great  you like that  it's a cool name  yeah  it's a cool name  fuck yeah  but sharks  have fins  yeah  his name is finn  but he's fighting sharks  oh wow  yeah you see that right  sure  it was amazing  if you know what i'd like  i would love to say 
[00:13:30]  what i think your nickname  should be  but i just can't  oh it's old  cock roberts  oh  yeah  his name was finn  finn  and uh  he uh  he had to stop  the sharknadoes  i don't know why  like  well he took it upon himself  yeah he really did  just take it upon himself  because they were in  situations where they  they were absolutely fine  well the writer  after the  after the genius writers  figured out that they were 
[00:14:00]  going to name this character  finn  yeah  then they were done writing  they were like  all right we figured out that  because  what they did  in order to stop any  questions about like  why would he do this  or  how did these sharks  happen like this  or why is everybody  accepting this  they just immediately  went into it  like  right in  45 seconds into the movie  it was the first  death by shark  the only uh  part that didn't have  sharks killing people  was the credits  correct  where they showed people  surfing and  you know  as if to say  everything's okay  everything's fine 
[00:14:30]  oh i i understand this  i've been to the beach  right  i've seen this stuff  that's all they wanted  to do to bring  the viewer  into the story  i've done that  oh my god  sharks are killing people  there are sharks  in the water  the water is on land  ergo  the sharks are here  sharks  they're here  yeah yeah  and uh  wow  uh then it was just  action packed  with  some of the most  inane dialogue  i've ever heard  in a movie  the 
[00:15:00]  the  the girl at one point  gave her version  of what would be  the quint  uh  uss indianapolis  speech  it was  so  douchey  she's talking  and the music  kind of got lower  yeah  and uh  she she gave this  story of her  and her grandfather  and it was  it was supposed to be  like the quint  indianapolis  was it supposed to be  douchey or no  i think the whole movie  was supposed to be  douchey  yeah  which is kind of  you know  the thing  i get it 
[00:15:30]  so it wasn't like  oh my god  what are they doing  because they had a lot  of jaws kind of  you'd call them  ripoffs  or an homage  i guess you could  call it  but uh  it was it was  it was awful  and and great  at the same time  but i don't think  like they went to  the actors and said  okay i want you  to do a bad job  at this  they were like  treat it like a  real movie  oh they did  tara reed  one of our best  performances ever  absolutely  her crying in the  back of that suv  uh holding on  to a friend  i really thought  there were sharks 
[00:16:00]  falling out of  tornadoes  you know you're  watching a great  movie when they're  driving down the  road  and there's bumps  on the roof  and they're going  what's that  what's that  what's that  and a shark  is on top of the  roof of the car  yeah  not underwater  no  and bites through  the roof of the car  fuck yeah  yeah  oh fuck yeah  chip thought it was  good  yeah  he bites through  the roof  like a shark  by the way  uh doesn't care  that he's out of  the water  he's doing you  know 60  on top of an  suv  uh a shark  did also  didn't care 
[00:16:30]  that they were  dropped into  chlorinated water  in a pool  um they just  seemed to be  hungry  right  no matter  what happened  well keep  in mind  maybe 15  minutes before  the shark  bit through  the roof  of a car  yeah  another shark  had just been  stopped by  knocking a  bookshelf  on top of  it  yes yes  i did notice  you were pointing  out things that  were greater  than sharks  right  from sharknado  yeah  uh a fire  extinguisher  fire extinguisher  greater than shark  yeah  bookshelf 
[00:17:00]  bookshelves  uh barstool  a barstool  greater than shark  barstool beats shark  dad from home alone  literally fought off  a hammerhead shark  with a barstool  with a barstool  it was amazing  it was like rock  paper scissors  but everything beat shark  right  it was ridiculous  uh what a highlight  though it was  uh to see  uh guest star  as the bus driver  that uh was  helping save  the little kids  in the bus  little um  robbie wrist  remember that name 
[00:17:30]  robbie wrist  who is  cousin oliver  from the brady punch  oh wow  good for him  he was the bus driver  and i  i saw your tweet  and i was with you  i was sure that  that bus driver  was going to survive  till the end  i knew  the type of character  the fat  straggly haired  bus driver  who's just kind of  trying to be a fun guy  who was waiting for  somebody heroic  to save the kids  because he couldn't do it  he couldn't do it  he knew he couldn't  but he waited  and then when he's  just standing

[00:19:30]  they only listed  i was trying to  confirm it too  there was so many  people in that movie  like like extras  yeah  and stuff  and they just  didn't list anybody  except like the main cast  they didn't hire anybody  to write credits for it  no  i don't think they did  they were just like  i don't know  you know put ian zirig in  yeah yeah yeah  put tara reed in  yeah we got that  how did that  i didn't see it  oh my god  god  you know  i don't know  if i want to spoil it  for people out there  that haven't seen it yet  i feel like this was  such a cultural event  yeah  but we've all seen it 
[00:20:00]  we've all seen it  last night  come on  we all gathered around  the tv  like the old days  like watching roots  or  yeah  within 2013  television is dead  the only thing people  watch on tv  are sports  and like a live award show  or something  yeah yeah  that's all you'll really  nobody  nobody does this  movie  it's a movie  it's gonna be on the internet  by the time the movie's done  it's on the internet  yeah  yeah  exactly  and it's on demand  and it's on dvr 
[00:20:30]  nobody gets together  and watches shows  when they're supposed  to watch them  people sat through  commercials last night  oh yeah  when was the last time  anybody sat through a commercial  because of sharknado  well you know what  if you haven't seen it  and you're really  you know  I'm gonna tell you  how it ends  it's amazing  and by the way  if you haven't seen it  don't worry  don't worry  it's sharknado  listen to the end  listen to the end  watch it  you'll just  it's sharknado  well they decided  they were gonna get rid  of these tornadoes  by throwing bombs into them 
[00:21:00]  into the tornado  oh right yeah  yeah yeah  so they went to a hardware store  they got a bunch of propane things  and flares  and timer thing  and then they got a helicopter  sure  and one of the guys  what a great actor he was  the guy in the helicopter  with his chick  right  they go up  and they start throwing  these bombs into the sharknado  how do you throw bombs  into a tornado  well you go next to it  with your helicopter  for some reason  which isn't affected  by tornadic winds  in a helicopter 
[00:21:30]  and you go next to it  and you just throw it  out the window  or out the door  into the sharknado  so you get close enough  for the helicopter  to throw a piece of  a heavy piece of fucking metal  into the sharknado  by the way  mind you  a girl throws it in  so you don't even get  that little extra  extra boost  of a guy throwing it  in the sharknado  and there's no residual wind  around the sharknado  oh well you know  the helicopter was shaking  a little bit  but  yeah most of the  most of the storm force winds 
[00:22:00]  were contained in that  well within the sharknado  were there a lot of sharknados  there were like three  yeah  three solid sharknados  Iraq did you want to  Jim already said it  but I was going to point out  that the tornadoes  were strong enough  to rip up the pier  and the Hollywood sign  but a helicopter  could get right next to it  get right next to it  it was amazing  the tornadoes  were strong enough  to carry sharks  sharks  and drop them on things  yeah  yeah  but  so they're throwing  the bombs in the sharknado  they killed like 
[00:22:30]  two sharknados  but there was one sharknado  they killed two sharknados  I know  they defeated  yes defeated  two sharknados  there was one left  very tough  the girl was ready  to throw it in  and a shark jumped up  to the helicopter  sure  and grabbed  well he didn't jump  he was in the sharknado  yeah  he grabbed onto the pylon  and then something happened  she falls out  and shark eats her  oh good  shark eats her  different shark eats her  different shark eats her  she was stabbing  the one that was grabbing  the bottom  yeah  and then she fell out  and another shark 
[00:23:00]  just happened to come out  of the tornado  and swallowed her  and swallowed her  and the guy's like  no  you know  freaking out  and that's what made  this movie so scary  it wasn't like  it was one two-headed shark  or one megasaurus  no no  you're talking about  literally hundreds  of sharks  thousands  in the streets  and the sky  in the sewers  in the sewers  in the sewers  in the streets  and then the weather  forecast would come on  and they'd be like  well there's these tornadoes  and very heavy rains  and stuff  and people are like  oh my god  tornadoes and rain  this is terrible  oh by the way  there's sharks in the street  and people are like  oh they accepted it 
[00:23:30]  like everyone just accepted  there were sharks  in the street  there was no  aha moment  or like oh my god  how did we end up  in a position  where there were sharks  in the streets  and they would say  like oh  you know  Los Angeles  has been hit  with a terrible tornado  it has left sharks  in the streets  but the winds  have just been  they were paying  more attention  to the weather  than the sharks  eating people  in the streets  but that was the strategy  yeah yeah  action action action  no time for asking questions  and no time for continuity  apparently either 
[00:24:00]  because it was either  tornadoes  and storm clouds  and rain  and sharks  or very sunny  dry streets  that they're driving through  right  and a little back story  yeah  whose relatives  were eaten by sharks  you know  that just happened  to tie together  so that's why  she hates sharks  well yeah  she did the quince speech  yeah  and well  they throw the bomb  into the sharknado  there's one sharknado  left and she gets eaten  and then the helicopter  comes down  well they decide  that they're gonna drive  one of the guys  decides he's gonna drive 
[00:24:30]  a truck full of bomb shit  into the last sharknado  to save everyone  he does that  sure  he does that  it's very cool  and well  when he's running back  he sees his daughter  there and he's like  oh get out of the way  because now all the sharks  are falling out of the  now dead sharknado  how is he not dead  well he rolled out of the truck  and let it go  into the sharknado  sharknado  so this is great  he picks up a chainsaw  right  and he's running  he's trying to tell  his daughter  he's like  get away  get away  because the sharks  are coming  and he sees a shark 
[00:25:00]  coming right for his daughter  he's like  holy shit  so he's fucking like  you see slow motion  he pulls the chainsaw  like  you know  the starter  and he pushes his daughter  out of the way  and jumps  at the shark  with the chainsaw  and he goes right  in the shark's mouth  right  right in  funk  and then the shark  with  with the chainsaw  with the chainsaw  shark hits  everyone's like  oh my god  he got eaten  sure  now you see a rumbling  inside the shark 
[00:25:30]  yeah it's cutting  he cuts himself  out of the shark  from inside  with  the chainsaw  and  pulls himself  right out  of the shark's belly  all full of blood  and he's going  yeah  and then he  you see him reach in  he reaches in  he pulls out  and what does he pull out  the chick that was  swallowed from the helicopter  yeah  so fucking dope 
[00:26:00]  what a twist that was  and she was alive  yes Jimmy  well I'm saying  you figure that  duh  you figure that  falling into the shark's mouth  you'd like rip your  your femur up  on his fucking teeth  you would think  do you think  wait that shark  falling at that height  well that's another thing  landed on him  yes  and the girl wasn't hurt  falling out of the  the bomb  sharknado  I don't understand  how the shark fell  from the height of the helicopter  hmm  uh  and  a shark 
[00:26:30]  was taken out of the ocean  yeah  sucked up in a tornado  yeah  dropped on the roof of a car  right  and still just thought  oh I'm hungry  I'm gonna eat  so wait why wasn't  why wasn't  the guy  why didn't the girl  when the shark mouth  fell perfectly over him  as well  sure  why didn't  A his chainsaw  hit the girl  who was inside  very good  um  and B  why didn't he and her  bump into each other  sharks weren't that big  no no  and how did he recognize  her in there  with no light  and did he say  hey how are you 
[00:27:00]  and she was like  I'm okay  can you cut us out of here  she was unconscious  don't be silly  about it Jimmy  oh right  Jesus  how long was she  in the shark pile  she was in the shark  for a while  yeah  and how did the sharks  stay in the air  so long after the sharknado  stopped  like he killed the sharknado  with the truck  yeah  then the sharks  just start falling  and and from the time  he went from the truck  all the way over  it was just falling  falling falling falling  maybe he had a shark  helicopter  I'm not sure  that shark would have been  doing like fucking  quite a clip  down to earth  yeah  and he was able to 
[00:27:30]  time it where he could  jump into the mouth  and the shark was  kind of going forward  like he was using  his pectoral fins  his wings  why wouldn't he  just move out  of the way  why would you  jump into the shark's  mouth with a chainsaw  he jumps out of the way  shark hits ground  roll credits  Jimmy  yeah  come on  he cut himself  out of the shark  the movie was designed  to not ask these questions  but the girl was  in the shark's mouth  so why when it was  falling onto the man  didn't the impact  kill her  when the shark  fell like head first 
[00:28:00]  right  but she's not far  back  she's pretty far back  the shark wasn't even  like didn't even splat  or anything  it just landed on the  ground like it was  just kind of tossed  there  well sharks are super  superhuman animals  I mean these  they're  one way to put it  they can survive  in any element  why didn't the girl  just crawl out of  the shark's asshole  she's unconscious  oh  I hope she's okay  yeah  yeah  I mean they  it's amazing  they did no  sort of character  development on anything  none  they just did  stereotypical movie cues 
[00:28:30]  so you knew  who to like and dislike  like Ian Ziering  showed up at  Tara Reid  his ex-wife's house  and of course  she's like got this  douchey new guy  that she's with  and you don't even  get to know him  because immediately  in his first scene  he opens the window  blinds  and a shark  breaks through his  window and eats him  eats him through the  window  that was so lame  but there was no like  let's take some time  to establish why  you don't like this guy 
[00:29:00]  yeah  instead they were like  no we'll put him  in a polo shirt  and slick his hair back  and have Ian Ziering  with a flannel  and a beard  not like him  he's the cool guy  right  cool guy douche  yeah  right  is there any video  at the end  Iraq  each scene  especially the one  Sam was talking about  had their own  little catchphrase  for the action  going on at that moment  and when they couldn't  stave Tara Reid's boyfriend  yeah  and they're looking  at the living room  that's full of water  it's all red sludge  somebody said  I guess it's that  time of the month  they just made a period joke 
[00:29:30]  period joke  fucking hilarious  ship likes that one  talking about periods  and then  Ian Ziering  in the beginning of the movie  when the sharks  first start coming  there's no question  as to why  the beach  has been overrun  by sharks  even in ankle deep water  yeah  it's infested with sharks  yeah yeah  there was no real  explanation to that  right  like why  in ankle deep water  are people getting  sucked into the ocean  by sharks  you know what  people loved it  right  who cares 
[00:30:00]  it was weird though  like when the  when the sharks  would come out  and they'd be  behind a rock  hiding  and then you'd hear  shuffle off to  buffalo play  and the shark  would come out  kind of doing  that dance to the side  a little top hat  on his fin  a cane in the other fin  a monocle  then he would just  bite you  yeah  not one shark  was interested  in eating  Ian Ziering  fin  in the film  no  why do they call him fin  that was his name  hey  it's a cool name  well it's obviously  a nickname  he's a surfer 
[00:30:30]  he's got a bar  right on the beach  no he was just  a bar owner  on the beach  he's a barkeep  barkeep  what was his last name  just fin  oh fin  just fin  he goes by fin  you don't need  two names  when you got  a cool name  like fin  but fin  is in a water  just on a surfboard  surrounded by sharks  and he has to save  a guy who's on a jet ski  yeah  now if the guy  on the jet ski  can't survive  the shark attack  obviously fin  is not attractive  to these sharks  I hope they gave him  a lousy last name  fin 
[00:31:00]  clurbans  clurbans  there's no need for it  it's k-l-e-u-r  b-e-n-s  that would be a horrible name  if your name is fin  fin  clurbans  and the father  from Home Alone  got killed too  real quick  real quick  yeah  but  he was heroic  in the sense  that he fought  a hammerhead shark  with a barstool  yeah with a barstool  it was great  they finally got him  though right  he was all drunk though  yeah yeah  he was just kind of  lush  he was just kind of  a drunk guy 
[00:31:30]  yeah  well there you  there you have it  spoiler alert  but uh  well it would win  an Emmy  fuck yeah  how quick  will they have a sequel  oh my god  probably next week  probably next week  they are in the middle  of filming Sharknado 2  and you know  Ian Ziering and Tara Reid  are just sitting there  like yes  they're into it  how embarrassing though  you want to say like  our movie did really good  right  look at these numbers  because I'm sure  when the numbers come out  people will be like  wow Sharknado did pretty good  for a sci-fi movie  and they'll be like 
[00:32:00]  it's that double-edged sword  it's like  yeah  hey one of my movies did well  well  it was Sharknado  yeah  but it's such a weird thing  that it's almost like  honorable  it's such a weird  yeah  piece of uh  obvious  shit  yes  yes  you know it's shit  yeah  that there's something about it  that's almost acceptable  yeah  and like Ian Ziering  could in a conversation  try to get away with saying  no no no  I mean you know  I knew that was shit 
[00:32:30]  my other work speaks for itself  but you know what I mean  still try to maintain  integrity as if there is any  what is that one right there  is that the picture Troy  the guy with the uh  I actually  I think the ending of the movie  might be in the trailer  wow  oh man  well that's the shot of him  see like  is that the shark  coming on top of him  yeah  see the thing is this  now the guy is about to be  the shark's about to land on  how come none of the shark's teeth  dragged on his stomach or chest  of course  he had his mouth open real wide  or hers 
[00:33:00]  yeah  she made it through without a  same scenario  mouth was open real wide  why'd the shark fall with his mouth open  imagine if the shark just landed on him  yeah the ending is in the trailer  yeah the ending's in the trailer  oh man  wow  too violent for TV  yeah  I think so  what  I mean  the shark was literally so hungry  that as he was falling from the sky  they were just shooting him  oh they're shooting him  the shark climbed a rope 
[00:33:30]  that was a good one  shark was climbing a rope  with his teeth  there he goes  no that's the one where he cut it in half  no he was kind of wrapping the rope around his tail  oh boy  there it is  see  you like it yet  fucking hilarious  action packed  it was action packed  this could happen  oh there goes Robbie Rist  oh they make it look like Robbie Rist got eaten by a shark 
[00:34:00]  but he didn't  he got hit with the Hollywood sign  yeah he had the worst death of the whole movie  the stupidest  if you're gonna be in Sharknado and die  you can't have a sign fall on you  no  so my idea about sharks with fedoras is not that stupid  no it wouldn't be  no  what was on before that  there was one  there was a shark week on sci-fi  yeah yeah  they're really loving the sharks  Rogan has a show on sci-fi coming out  yeah  I saw the trailers for Rogan's show  Joe Rogan questions everything  can you  how happy must Joe Rogan be 
[00:34:30]  right  they were doing the little Joe Rogan questions everything graphics  in the corner  of Sharknado the whole time  doing a giant movie like Sharknado  I was thinking that too  like Rogan made out very well  yeah  with that movie getting so many people watching it  they should do like a fucking movie where like  a bunch of guys who look like Joe Rogan  are swooped up by a fucking tornado  and it's called fucking Gorilla-Nado  and they're big hairy knuckles  and they just  they fall down and their fists hit you  they pummel you  he's a long-armed man 
[00:35:00]  oh my god  big fucking  he's a monster  I saw him recently  and it's just  his arms just don't hang like a human  no  they're just meant to injure people  he is Simeon-like  yes  there's definitely something  a gorilla-like  yeah  fucking Shane Wallet  nice enough guy  yeah  really nice guy  he really is  thank god  I wonder when the last fight he got in was  if Joe only fucked your chick  and didn't knock your teeth out  you'd call him a nice guy  what a pleasure he is 
[00:35:30]  he's a good dude  he fucked your girl  yeah but I can still talk  you know what  he could have beaten the shit out of me  right  and fucked my chick  so there was one right before  is there a sci-fi lineup Troy  um  yeah I don't know  because I think  I'm sure sci-fi realized  that all the morning news shows  and everything  was talking about this Sharknado  they knew  and so they were like  think they were high-fiving  around the old sci-fi studio  uh  offices  they just reorganized  everything on the lineup  we just have to air  sci-fi original movies today 
[00:36:00]  yes  yes  just one after another  after another  what are they gonna do  play that new version  of Twilight Zone  or something  no  there was one  I was watching  where the shark came on land  and he was giant  and the military was shooting him  it was a fucking Ed Wood movie  god that's great  yeah Ed Wood  that does seem like  a very Ed Wood thing  because the effects weren't good  sharks would be able  to fall out of the sky  and land right on you  without the teeth scraping you  Sharknado  I like to wear women's clothing  from outer space  yeah 
[00:36:30]  yeah so that was  that took up a lot of the  bulk of the night  I felt obligated to watch it  I did too  and I wasn't even gonna watch it  right  and then as I'm tweeting  I'm looking at Twitter  and everyone else was watching it  so peer pressure  it was total peer pressure  I'm like  I gotta watch it  Netflix  feels like a tweet  I was watching the new Netflix show  Orange is the New Black  it's actually a really good show  what's it about  it's a  it's a true story  a woman goes to prison  the guy who did Weeds 
[00:37:00]  did it  is it open with Anthony  throwing out all his orange shirts  but I was sitting there going like  yeah I think I'm just gonna watch this  and I realized  like it was like  we're getting towards nine o'clock  and I saw that  I was like  I can't not  it was the tweets that got me  I'm like  I don't want to be  left out of this  yeah  everyone's tweeting about it  what's it about Sam  I'm sorry  it's a woman  she's like a  regular woman 
[00:37:30]  she's like  but she used to be a lesbian  who was involved in some kind of drug thing  ten years ago  and she ends up having to go to jail for 15 months  okay  and it just  oh orange  okay  yeah yeah  it's funny  it's like a funny  it's like a comedy drama  but it's good  okay  but that's what I wanted to watch  yeah  of course you did  I was enjoying it  I watched two episodes  I was like  I'd really like to keep watching this show  yeah yeah  not an option  not when Twitter explodes like that  there's a cultural event happening  you gotta get on it  you do feel like you're left out  if you're not  on Twitter 
[00:38:00]  yeah  and interacting with people like that  when  you know  award shows  like you were saying  any kind of event  you just feel like you gotta get in there  I hope people like  I wrote a shark movie  oh  you did  it's about  yeah  it's about sharks  who are just not that competent  um  hmm  it's called Shark Fredo  yes  yes  it's like  Sharknado  but Shark Fredo  that would be a 
[00:38:30]  great movie  Mike  you don't come to Las Vegas  and talk to a man  like Matt Hooper  like that  Shark Fredo  what a wimpy shark  there's also  you know  he's in  this Netflix show  Jason Biggs  from American Pie  oh the pie fucker  and I'm going  there's Jason Biggs  he's in this new show  that's like  a real show 
[00:39:00]  it's a good show  and the guy who did Weeds  did it  and it's getting like  acclaim  like people  it's got good reviews  and it's okay  he's got a great series  yeah  and what are his co-stars doing  oh there's Tara Reid  in Sharknado  Sharknado  yeah  yeah  they're going head to head  yeah  I felt bad for Vinny  from Jersey Shore  yeah  because he had  he had his show on  and he was tweeting  and I'm just looking like  no one  what are you doing Vinny  no one's watching that  because they're watching 
[00:39:30]  Sharknado  absolutely  unless you're fucking  now that everybody knows  you have a foreskin  unless that's somehow  featured being bitten off  by a fucking shark  yeah  how is that news  Vinny from Jersey Shore  has a foreskin  and he's mad  that his mother  put out that information  wow  it's news  but when he was tweeting  he tweeted  everybody tune in to MTV  right now  because the one hour finale  of the Vinny show  is on  ignore it  I felt so bad for him  I felt so bad for him  you don't have a shot  no way 
[00:40:00]  the excitement  that was going on  look at that  a little bit of  a little bit of chocolate  out there  you like her  what  oh she's the hip hop  she's cute  she's the one that's down  at the other studio  she's very nice too  yeah she always says hi  yeah I've chatted with her  a little bit  me with a little rapport going  I say hello  she's like how are you  I'm like not bad  yourself  wow  her ass isn't like  too big  right  because I don't like  those big fucking  but donk and donk  imagine me and you  just having this conversation  behind her on the elevator 
[00:40:30]  how fast are you fired  oh my god  yes that'd be great  is that her right there  yeah  she's very uh  classical  black  features  very pretty  what is she  what is that show  anyway  it's on uh  hip hop nation  oh it is  it's a morning show  she seems like she has fun  like I always walk by her window  and she's always in there  like fucking chatting up a storm  into the mic  and she seems like she's having  a fucking ball on the air  yeah and there are people  like get dressed to do it 
[00:41:00]  like she's wearing like a  hip hat and shit  and glasses  and she's on there  and I just come in here  dressed like a bum  every day  a fucking bum  oh do you know what was on  um uh  the shark one before  jimmy walker played  the radio dj  oh no  and it was fucking  it's the worst thing  I've ever seen  wow  because he was doing  he says something  dynamite  he did dynamite  he did dynamite  oh it was  without the same enthusiasm  though right  no he's getting paid for  but it was out with the same 
[00:41:30]  he's older  he's 60  his acting  I would say  was not up to snuff  no  no  and he's wearing like  a really bad glasses  and a hat  it was like a  blaxploitation shot  it was terrible  oh god  he's called super shark  and his character  is dynamite stevens  dynamite stevens  I bet  oh  what did he feel  when he was being  pitched this project  and they were like  yeah your character's name  is going to be  dynamite  yeah dynamite 
[00:42:00]  could you say  the dynamite line  good boy  I mean  good Jimmy  yeah  I love watching  twitter explode  for something like  Sharknado  yeah  because all these shows  try so hard  to get like  a happening  on the internet  yes  every show  has like a little  hashtag  in the corner  we'll be live tweeting tonight  and they get their stars  to live tweet  and they all try  to get something going  and out of nowhere  this fucking monstrosity  just something  stupid  Iraq 
[00:42:30]  comment  what Sam was saying  Americans Got Talent  now started doing hashtags  per act  that performs on there  they pass and go through  they show a hashtag  at the end of the act  when they're getting applauded  and everything  every segment has its own hashtag  I hear that show's  really fucking bad  this season  it's not good  like the acts are just  like  like shit you just see  on the sidewalk  like a bad sidewalk act  who's on that show  is the judges  or the acts  Howard  Howie  Howie  Howard Stern 
[00:43:00]  Mel B  from the Spice Girls  Mel B  and the blonde  Heidi Klum  I like Heidi Klum  though  I don't know  how she is as a judge  but I think she's  like as far as  being in that world  like as a model  I like her  yeah I mean  she's  all I would do  if I fucked her  was make her tell me  how much better  Seal was  seal in his big cock  you hope  I don't know  it's just  that show's got no heat  it's done 
[00:43:30]  Donski  seems like all those shows  are like  it's just the nature  of American Idol  was such a smash  it just doesn't seem  like anybody gives a fuck  but then when you look  and realize Survivor  is still on  yeah  Big Brother's still on  Big Brother  I have not heard  one person  talk about Survivor  it's like  oh did you see the finale  did you see who won Survivor  like not  not one news  station that  that we watch  all of them  in here  has ever said 
[00:44:00]  and last night's finale  of Survivor  this one  we're here in radio  we talk to a lot of people  no one ever talks  about Survivor  how the fuck  is it still on  you remember  what a celebrity  gay naked  Richard Hatch was  when he won Survivor  Elizabeth Hasselbeck  is from Survivor  right  yeah  then you get  these people  from Survivor  that go on  to do other things  but  like the show  it's still  like the host  Entertainment Weekly Radio  who was Kimmy  when I first started  going on the show  remember Kimmy  from Survivor  yeah  and she had a great body 
[00:44:30]  and I got to  fucking  I went in there  and she watched  she got changed  and ain't naked  yes  and I still have those photos  where she's like  in whipped cream  do you ever see those photos  you know  yeah I think we have those  is that 2000  2001  I think  oh god  Kimmy from Survivor  yeah  what is she  is she like  she was dating a jet  at one point  was she  the 777  yes  yes  it was a jet  with a smaller tail  it was a Korean air jet  oh whoops  what a terrible joke  not offensive 
[00:45:00]  just terribly  brought out  she married  is that her now  she was beautiful  there was something  very sexy about her  oh my god  what a body on her  yeah  but even like  the successful shows  like the voice  that is still  yeah  it's a very successful show  nobody knows who won that show  no one knows who won  and there's no scuttlebutt  no water cooler chat  about these shows  and nobody's becoming famous  off of it anymore  nobody wins American Idol  or the voice  or anything  like they'll get a single  on the radio  yeah  but that's it  nobody won't 
[00:45:30]  never have any heat  there's not  it's so fucking odd  what's the next thing  my show about  like  about  menstruation  and dragons  I'm hoping  is a big hit  what's it called  Game of Clots  no  I don't think  it'll wash  no  I don't think  that one's  gonna really  go over  what's her name  Kappenberg  yeah  I mean  I think people  are just sick  of  the contest show 
[00:46:00]  the contest show  it's  how many times  can they just  do that  like  it's the same format  first it was  adding huge  celebrities  as judges  because then  it's like  who gives a fuck  about these contestants  I like watching  these judges  and then  it was when  TV started  getting good again  when Breaking Bad  and Mad Men  and all those  shows came on  right right  now you got  oh I forgot  quality written  programming  right  it doesn't have  to be stupid  yeah 
[00:46:30]  well when Simon  left American Idol  you know  that seemed like  that was the beginning  of the end  of that whole fuck  because everything  became a copy  of that  yeah  they had the  Simon character  and it wasn't even  Simon isn't even  the element anymore  because he left Idol  and Idol  is not doing well  but then he goes  and does X Factor  and X Factor  didn't do well either  oh it's not doing well  okay  it was just that  you know  him leaving  it ended that  time and place  kind of a thing  I think  but he  on the other side  he has ownership  in American Idol  X Factor 
[00:47:00]  America's Got Talent  and one other show  oh that son of a gun  has got money  don't you worry  he's doing very well  nice observation  very well  that SOB is good  so what's Kimmy  Kattenberg doing  Kattenberg  I'm sorry  she's married  she got married  in August 2004  wow she's married  nine years  yeah  who'd she marry  was it with that guy  from the Jets  didn't say  um  lives in Ronkonkoma  okay  she's the conk  she's out in the conk  as Colin calls it 
[00:47:30]  wow  she must just be  this white trashy  housewife now  I hope so  white trash housewife  from fucking Ronkonkoma  it's fucking great  I love that  Colin calls it the conk  we were driving  through Long Island  and we passed aside  for Ronkonkoma  and I was like  Jess  Colin calls it the conk  the conk  she's like  I don't even know  what Ronkonkoma is  like there's some  action going on  there like  you gotta give it  a cool name  it's the conk  right  the conk  I love Colin's take  on Long Island  it's fucking perfect

[00:52:30]  I'm pretty good  with interrupting people  but  you know  I get a word  in more  oh that must go  over well  with everybody  yeah  Bernie's tired  of the I-Man  interrupting him  I guess so  he wants his shit  out there  last time I was on  I was on with him  and also  he's sitting  to my right  and to  Gutfeld's left  so  it's hard  to talk  over him 
[00:53:00]  and in between  because he's  right in the middle  so he'll interject  a lot  you know  he's a nice enough  guy  but Jesus  no one else  could talk  you gotta say  to him  you gotta say  do you understand  you gotta like  say to him  like point out  to you guys  do you see us  these are real  people  we're not  we're not  actors in your play  we're real people  you think he'd  be okay with that  I think so  Bernie's a fucking  he's a funny dude  I know  I like Bernie  what is the thing  it's from  you see these people  these are real people 
[00:53:30]  I think it's a  cuckoo's nest line  was it cuckoo's nest  yeah  oh fuck  talking about  the kooks  yeah  I don't know  what was happening  that he was telling  that these are real people  fuck  I don't remember  the last time  I even watched that  it's so good  I think of movies  that I want to watch  and then I'm like  all of a sudden  I'll be like  oh  I got some free time  let me watch  one of those movies  I was talking about  or thinking about  that I want to watch  what was it  and then I just 
[00:54:00]  never remember  and then I'm thinking  well maybe I should  put it down in my notes  on my phone  or something like that  and then when I'm  thinking about it  I'm like  I'll remember this  it's like  a fucking movie  I want to watch  you picked up your phone  and like in your notes  it was like  I want to watch  cuckoo's nest  jaws  make a little list  I love little  phone lists  terrible list  I have a lot of things  in my notes  on my phone  like what  manifesto  you mean  manifesto 
[00:54:30]  yeah  no I do  I have a lot of things  that I cut and paste  when I'm tweeting  links and what not  to various FBI crime stats  sites  and other things  because people always  you know  oh where did you get that from  and I'm like  I go to notes  I copy  I paste  I'm like  so I got this whole little line up  you have a file  on your phone  yeah  because of how often  you send out angry  argumentative  well you could say it that way  racially infused tweets  I would rather say it 
[00:55:00]  as a lot of people  get the wrong impression  and I set them straight  with some facts  that I have in my notes  Anthony's just a jerk  I do love reading your Twitter  I am a jerk  but it's really funny  but it's really funny  to me to read it  because  you know  I believe me  I understand that  fucking trying to make the point  and you're fucking fighting  all these people off  yeah yeah  and it's just funny to watch  like you'll just go  you see Anthony go through  all these logical Zimmerman tweets 
[00:55:30]  and it's like  you're never gonna win  I know you're never gonna win  and a lot of people are like  Anthony calm down  watch your blood pressure  and I'm like  you don't understand  I'm like either  I'm laying on the couch  and I'm not like  every tweet going  you motherfucker  it's very casual  just I'll read it and go  oh wow  that person is really  off on this  and you spend  all your free time  filling your mind  with every detail  of the Zimmerman case  every little detail  when this happens  it can be casual  yes  you've already gotten yourself 
[00:56:00]  furious about it  I've already done it  so nobody else is gonna be able  to do it  you do it yourself  no one's gonna do it  but I have been  checking out the  the just it  hashtag justice for Trayvon  yeah see that's like  you're going to a hashtag  oh I was searching it out  yes I was  you disagree with  looking for  ignorance  anything that you can call out  to be like  look look look  yeah some  some girl yesterday  was like  oh I hate that  that George Zimmerman 
[00:56:30]  I'd like to punch him  in his fat face  and I retweeted  and put  well look what happened  to the last guy  so  and  hashtag justice for Trayvon  okay well then they're all gonna see it  yes  yes  see then they all see it  and they get very angry  well yeah  I mean you went out of your way  uh huh  to upset them  uh  well you know what  they're all there  like this little club  like this little clique  with their little hashtag  that they're 
[00:57:00]  that they're doing  why won't you let them all  exist within their hashtag  because  why do you have to enter into it  I need to give some truth  to these people  because they don't seem to understand  what's going on  have you convinced a lot of them  turn a lot of them around  not a one  well you guys don't understand  each other's truth  yeah  your truth is different  than theirs  and they  that they just  my truth is the real truth  Jimmy  I know we all think that  that's what every maniac  well they  I see a lot of the  murderer 
[00:57:30]  I see a lot of the  justice for Trayvon  uh  hashtag tweets  and uh  many of them  okay  not right or wrong  with ideology  but very inaccurate  yeah  as to the facts  of the case  but  how come  when did you become  the fact police  that you have to go  and find people  the fact police  da da  you have to find people  that you don't even know  yeah  they're just sitting there  it's some person  with four followers  just tweeting out 
[00:58:00]  some dumb shit  and they can't just  have their dumb shit  you have to be like  you're wrong  I am throwing  bombs into their  ideological  sharknados  trying to bust them apart  but they're not a danger  the way a sharknado is  they're just an idiot  with twitter  no you're not throwing  bombs into their sharknado  you're throwing chum  chum  you're throwing chum  that's exactly right  you're not convincing  anybody  of something that  like you're not 
[00:58:30]  changing somebody's  viewpoint  you're actually  giving them an enemy  and you're getting  angry at them  for having their  viewpoint  yeah  now the viewpoint's  one thing  when there's  complete inaccuracies  that they're  spreading  as far as  facts of the case  let's say  but they're not  spreading  they don't  they don't have  a radio show  like you  they don't have  a bunch of  social media  it makes  a feeding frenzy  in their justice  for Trayvon circle  what the hell  is that 
[00:59:00]  that's Trayvon  and he's  chilling with  is that  that's  Emmett Tillis  yeah  Emmett  Till  I think  I always say  Tillis  I'm sorry  I think it's  Emmett Tillis  look him up  I'm sorry  they're equating  Trayvon  with  a kid  a black hero  that was killed  by the Klan  wasn't he dragged  for looking at  a white girl  or something  again  I told you  yesterday  I'm sure you  know this  but part  of what's  happening  is  I'm sorry 
[00:59:30]  I always say  Tillis  it's Emmett Till  it's  Mel Tillis  is what I'm thinking  oh right  but it's  we're paying  for the fucking  we're paying  for other people's  shit  I didn't do anything  I am paying  I am  I'm saying  that we as a  whole are paying  but it is  it is a reality  I'm not  I won't accept it  as a reality  I'm not accepting it  it's done  there's opportunity  and everything  there's no more  of this bullshit  happening  stop perpetuating  like Trayvon Martin  being looked at  a certain way  he's paying 
[01:00:00]  for other people's  shit  no he's paying  for the fact that  yeah he's paying  for other people's  shit  other young black men  that rob fucking  convenience stores  with hoodies on  yes  but I'm saying  like he  that's  even though it's  a more active thing  we're all kind of  paying for other  people's shit  and that's  when you look at  it logically  like why are  people being  murdered in Chicago  like children  being fucking  randomly  why does this  tap into something  that that's not  tapping into  it's because  it's about the  person that 
[01:00:30]  does the killing  and not the victim  no one cares  about the victim  so why  not even the black  community  gives a shit  about the victims  of murder  oh a black  five year old kid  and a seven year old  kid was shot  in Chicago  who did it  no the black guy  probably a gang member  ah well  that's not as good  as if it was  some white guy  or some half white  half hispanic guy  that all of a sudden  is a story  and they say  justice for Drayvon  that was a young  child  we need justice 
[01:01:00]  for Drayvon  you don't give a shit  what about  name the kid  in fucking Chicago  the five year old  or the seven year old  go ahead  put his picture  on a fucking shirt  you dummies  their argument  I'm guessing would be  because I'm not black  from the industry  their argument would be  yeah but the perpetrators  of those crimes  are arrested  and treated like criminals  that's what  I'm guessing  that would be a response  to that  but it doesn't matter  so why  the justice is being served  for these victims  because the perpetrators  of the crimes  are at least being treated  like criminals  and arrested  justice was being served 
[01:01:30]  in this one  when they did not bring  a case against  George Zimmerman  because the investigators  on scene  and after they looked it over  deemed it as self defense  which is why I'm saying  that we're paying  for a history  I'm not saying it's right  but the reality of it is  there are times  where it just irritates  me that people have  behaved a certain way  so many times  that it's still  this fucking blowback shit  we still feel the effects  but we can't kowtow  to it every time  because then it just  perpetuates it  it's got to end  at some point  where you go 
[01:02:00]  ah I want  I want  and you gotta go  no  you don't get anymore  but back then  yeah that was terrible  move along  move along  but I'm not saying  kowtow to it  I'm not saying  we kowtow to it  by bringing Zimmerman  to trial  that is kowtowing  to public pressure  pressure  in the black community  to bring charges  and bring a case  against an innocent man  who was deemed  innocent  in the eyes  of the people  that are supposed  to deem you innocent  in a self-defense case  they didn't 
[01:02:30]  the investigators  said no  it's self-defense  and you're seeing  that come out  in the prosecution's case  they don't have anything  yeah they really don't  so  so how is  and I love that  blacks  saying they don't have  any power  in this country  we don't have  they were able to bring  an innocent white man  a white hispanic man  slash slash  to trial  to trial  well he helped  by shooting somebody  no it was  but I mean  after it was looked at 
[01:03:00]  and seen to be  self-defense  they were able  to get that  turned around  and not that  it was justified  to bring him  to trial  just because  just because  of public pressure  not because  of this influx  of new evidence  it had nothing to do with  there was no new evidence  that made it like  oh well the police  on scene  didn't see this  and that's why  they didn't arrest him  so but now we got this  so let's bring him in  no it was the same shit  that they saw  when they investigated 
[01:03:30]  the case  the only change was  that black people  got information about it  saw that that happened  and went  oh we want justice  well justice was served  if it had been a black guy  shooting a white guy  do you think they would have  as quickly said  it was self-defense  why do you think  if and what would they do  look at the news  and you'll see what they do  you'll see what they do  there's a case from Long Island  where a black guy  and his son  his son came back  to the black guy's house  and three white guys 
[01:04:00]  I guess were  had a problem with the son  oh yeah  so they're drunk  they're on the front lawn  of this guy's house  they start yelling  and shit like that  the black father  comes out  he shoots  the three white guys  did he shoot all three of them  or one of them  I think he shot  shot at them  he shot one of them  killed one right  yeah killed one of them  of course  all right  they arrested him  they arrested him  he said self-defense  he was tried under  you know  his defense was self-defense  and convicted 
[01:04:30]  he was convicted  that guy  yeah  the Patterson at the time  yeah  he was convicted  Patterson at the time  who was the governor  cleared him  said  all right  what is that called  when they  I pardoned  I pardoned  oh did he really  okay  yeah you pardoned him  I didn't know all the facts  of that  but I remember  from again  just what I had read  that I thought  that that guy was justified  again just on the  the facts I had read  was that  they were at his house  yeah  they'd gone 
[01:05:00]  first of all  if you go to someone's house  it's different  definitely  to me  there's an implied threat  when three guys  go to your house  he wasn't arrested  right away either  by the way  he was not arrested  right away  he claimed self-defense  and they  you know  they let him  claim self-defense  then they investigated  what had happened  this is also New York  not Florida  right right  exactly  big difference  yeah  so when they  when they investigated  they found  a lot of  like glaring  inconsistencies  and  oh okay  he was convicted  but then 
[01:05:30]  it was overturned  did white people  riot  was there a big  fucking stink  no one even  knew about this  he killed a white kid  uh  claimed self-defense  uh  and then the governor  let him out  after he was convicted  could you imagine  in Florida  that Zimmerman  gets convicted  and then the governor  of Florida  pardons Zimmerman  there would be  burning cities  and it's like  it's it's  and it's not a popular  thing to say  but again  it's we 
[01:06:00]  we know the way  the country is set up  and and again  it is where we are  what that if you work  and um  uh  with a little luck  you'll succeed in this country  yeah I mean that's  I mean  there's a lot  I'm so tired of the excuses  so fucking  and there's  there's  you're right  but there's a fucking line between  there's excuses  and then there are times  where it's legit  and the  the tricky part  is separating  when there's  when it's bullshit  the thing is  when it's legit  there is legitimate  racism  sure there is  there's a legitimate 
[01:06:30]  black racism  I see it every day  it's amazing  but  when every single  instance  of  a black person  uh  getting  arrested  or  uh  killed  or  the police  shoot a young  black man  when every single  instance  is some grave  injustice  that's being done  it's horse shit  it's bullshit  I blame  white people  because white people  just like they are  have been full of shit  about fucking race 
[01:07:00]  forever  like  Patrice said  I never met a racist  never honest  never  even today  not honest  even good natured liberals  who mean well  aren't honest about  their feelings of  uh  of  of  fucking  intellectual superiority  and  and racists aren't honest  about just not like  no one is  and that's all  so we hear like  black people  I'm not saying always being right  but being honest  at least saying what they think 
[01:07:30]  and we're like  all right fucking  they sound like  at least they're telling the truth  fucking white people  have been fucking phony about it  and that's the same ones  that are gonna try to get us fired  you know what I mean  it's  it's not blacks that get you fired  it's fucking phony  white people  because black people  don't make those decisions  they don't run CBS radio  or whatever  or serious action  no but they're the ones  that put the  put the screws  to the fucking  bosses  they're the ones  that uh  threaten marches  and threaten uh  boycotts  which by the way  wouldn't amount to anything 
[01:08:00]  right  but but these bosses  get so fucking scared  that white people  have been backed  into this scary  little corner  where we can't even  talk about fucking race  uh you know  who backed us there though  there's this big vocabulary  we can't use  but think about it  who backed white people  into that corner  nobody  white people  went and stood  in that corner  nobody backed  white people  into a corner  white people  went and stood  in that corner  whether it was out of guilt  or whatever the fuck  it was  and goes 
[01:08:30]  oh my goodness  and it's like  well what the fuck  are we talking  and again  white people  are the ones  that have been  fucking lying about it  all along  being fake about it  so if we just  stop doing that  tomorrow  and uh  a black uh  group comes up  to some company  and says  ah your employee  did this  uh we want you  to do this  and they said  nah go fuck yourself  the outrage  but again  not necessarily  go fuck yourself  but instead of  just immediately  going  oh god you're right  have an honest  discussion about it  and weigh what 
[01:09:00]  happened honestly  and then make  an informed decision  there are times  where the employee  did do something racist  and should be fired  and then there's times  where the employee  didn't  and the company  has to say  respectfully  like they would  to any other  fucking subgroup  or fucking special interest group  hey look  we hear what you're saying  we don't agree  we're gonna stand  by our employee  just like fucking  uh uh  whatever network it was  stood by  Jack Cafferty  when he said that thing  of the Chinese thugs  and the Chinese got mad  and nothing happened  yeah yeah yeah  so boycotts mean shit 
[01:09:30]  unless there's  black people don't commit  to big boy  this is not Selma  in the 60s  where the bus boycott  meant something  yeah yeah  these type of things  because the news cycle  is so fast  they come and go  I know  but I'm just not putting  all this blame  on uh  whitey  I'll give us  95 to 98%  because I'm telling you  in the audiences  I see it  um  or when I talk about it  with people  uh  the people  and again  you're fucking  brutally honest  and my circle  of friends are  but man 
[01:10:00]  you watch  and the ones  who are making  the decisions  are fucking  white people  they're the ones  that in standards  and practices  where they're  you know  they're Asian  but they're not  these fucking  these daishiki  wearing black people  coming up to me  when standards  and practices  go  don't say that  white devil  never  but black people  can comment  on whatever they want  and and and continue  with this  cultural fucking  whatever  it's it's the culture  it's this  yeah yeah we get it  because  they don't have  anything to lose  from it 
[01:10:30]  they don't have  anything to lose  no man  no one's gonna fire  a black person  for saying something  right  no white guy  is gonna fire  a black  again it all  comes back  to to white people  either fucking  veiling racism  and again I don't  mean every white  person  or fucking being  too embarrassed  to admit that  they feel better  than  so the spoiled  child  the parents  to blame  for the spoiled  child  is what you're  saying  the parents  the parents  but you're  fucking  but who's  annoying you  the spoiled 
[01:11:00]  fucking child  I see a certain  element of spoiled  child  in the black  community  for years  for years  white society  has been  bending over  backwards  to take care  of black people  it's just  how this fucking  society's worked  up  we go  we talk about  we like skipping  over recent history  and we love  going back  to how bad  it was  we all get it  no one's gonna  come up with  any new shit  on how bad  slavery and 
[01:11:30]  racism was  throughout  the history  of this country  but let's go  to recent history  where white  society  has bent  over backwards  not to offend  black people  not to fucking  criticize them  on anything  to make excuses  for horrid  behavior  for a lack  of perseverance  and drive  to get an  education  like all that  shit  that's our  recent history  that to me 
[01:12:00]  more hurtful  than the fucking  horrible  history  from the past  but again  the people  making the  excuses  are white  people  and they're  fucking  it makes me  sick  like you know  and me and Keith  talked about this  one time  and you know how  black people have  the barbershop  where they go  and that's what  fucking black guys  say anything to each  other that we don't  you know we  understand each other  as white guys  too and there's  things that white  people understand  about each other  that fucking black  people have no  idea about  and we understand  that thing that 
[01:12:30]  other white people  are doing  that fucking  phony thing  and it makes me  not like  we sat in the room  with fucking  Chiasano and  Tracy Clarity  and whoever else  was running CBS  at the time  and had that  discussion  and Tom Chiasano  said something  like we were  talking about  doing racial jokes  you couldn't do  racial Asian jokes  but meanwhile  they were running  an ad  promoting Joe Coy  you know  he was a half  Asian comic  whatever he is  just doing his act  and then a clip  there was an Asian joke  and I'm like  that's fine to play  you should play that 
[01:13:00]  but we can't do  like it's insanity  and Tom  a white guy  said well you know  it's like  you know the Irish  brothers  like you know  my brother can make  I'm like  are you willing  to put that  in writing  these are our jobs  and do you remember  that he goes  no  that wasn't  some fucking radical  that's how fucking  white people think  and yeah  Asian groups come up  just like the Catholic  League comes up  just like every other  fucking group comes up  but the response  to those groups  is what the problem is  that's why I don't hate  Bill Donahue  the Catholic League 
[01:13:30]  remember when Louis  was like  or a pendulum  at first  how the fuck  could you guys  forgive them  because they  did not fire us  it was not  Bill Donahue  he didn't have  the power to  he bitched  and moaned  and the shitty  people running  the company  weren't honest enough  to go yeah  we were behind that  we knew it was going on  we're gonna support  the guys  they chose  the fucking easier  way out  to make themselves  look good  like every fucking  phony  who heard that  Paula Deen said  nigger  all of a sudden  wants to use her  as a way to go  look what I don't say  I don't do that  it's bullshit 
[01:14:00]  yeah I do see it  and black people  I'm sorry  black people are the ones  who are more  defending Paula Deen  than white people  more black people  going like  I work for her  she's not like that  yeah yeah  I see that part of it  and I do see  your point about  white people  and having that  whatever it is  to swing the axe  to get you fired  do things like that  but there's the  black society  the black culture  that  is just 
[01:14:30]  so self destructive  yeah there are parts of that  yeah  and that  you know  has to be addressed  I don't know how  white people  are to blame  for  for  15 deaths  and 70 shootings  on a weekend  in Chicago  I mean  I can't fathom  how that boils down  to something  whitey did  it's weird though  how we line up  and again I do it too  you know what I mean  like we fucking  we line up on sides  like and Patrice again  I keep quoting him  but he was so great 
[01:15:00]  with this  oh yeah  he was talking  and he's like  when I'm talking about  white people  I don't mean you  yeah yeah  we don't mean you  meaning Jim or Anthony  or fucking  certainly not Sam  or Troy  like they're not  talking about  the average dude  but yet  we hear that  and we fucking  line up  just like  you know  afraid of black men  it's not  you know  the average black guy  you know  you're afraid of  the fucking  the guys in those  fucking like  you know  Gangsta Disciple videos  like those are  the scary dudes to us  which is not even  the ones that probably  should be scared of us 
[01:15:30]  because they don't  really bother  they don't  they don't fuck  with white people  that much  I mean  unless you happen  to be there  but  yeah yeah  but there's a  I think there's  personal responsibilities  fucking gone  and there has to be  some personal  responsibility  if you're  if you're going  and there's the way  things should be  and the way things  they are  the way things are  okay  and and  the way things  should be  is that anybody  should be able  to walk through  a neighborhood  wearing whatever  the fuck they want  and go from  point A to point B 
[01:16:00]  without being interrupted  the way things are  if you're dressed  a certain way  and you fit  a certain  profile  you're probably  going to get  looked at  closer  by certain people  that's the way  things are  and they're  like that  not because  of some  some thought  that popped  into some guy's  head  as he's going  to Target  you know  he saw  a young black  guy  in a hoodie  walking around 
[01:16:30]  his neighborhood  and again  how it should be  he shouldn't have  given it a second  look  gets in his car  drives to Target  everything's fine  but the truth of the matter is  when you look at  the 12 burglaries  that happened  in that neighborhood  and the descriptions  of whoever they did see  doing things like that  was a young black male  in a hoodie  you're gonna give it  some fucking  extra attention  but in that  in that  and I  of course I understand that  yeah  I don't  even black guys  don't kill him  for profiling  everybody knows  why you'd look  at the guy  that's the biggest  case that the  prosecution's making  that George Zimmerman 
[01:17:00]  profiled this young man  yeah  and what the fuck  is so bad about that  I'll tell you  what's bad about it  and it's the price  we pay for being  and this is where  cops have something  that people who want  to be cops  don't have  he was wrong  and when  was he  yes  how do you know  because  he said he was  he said he  oh that guy looks like  he's on drugs  well it turns out  he was on drugs  he says  he's up to something  you know  and his text and stuff  sure  court can't admit it  but we can talk 
[01:17:30]  about it here  the kid was a little  thug  sorry  he was a little  had he ever been  arrested  no  but that doesn't mean  he wasn't doing  anything  he was only 17  so  and  and  the police  didn't arrest him  at one point  because there was  some fucking thing  that was put out  that they wanted  to keep  young black men  out of the  system  for as long  as they could  so there was  instances where  they blew shit off  when he had  the seven pieces  of fucking jewelry  in his backpack 
[01:18:00]  and a flathead  screwdriver  and it was like  where did this  come from  ain't mine  and this is his  statements  ain't mine  uh  where'd you get it  a friend gave it  to me  alright  look  in court  you can't do  anything about it  but as we look  around and go  like  everyone wants to  judge George Zimmerman  away from the facts  and go well  we know what he was  thinking  how about Trayvon  we know what he was  thinking  that's like saying  if that was  a chick walking 
[01:18:30]  and Zimmerman  had pinned her  down and fucked  her  and then turns out  she fucked the  whole football team  in another city  people were like  see she was a whore  but Zimmerman  didn't know that  he profiled this  guy wrong  because the guy  whether that guy  had a terrible  history or not  he was just  he literally  in that night  he didn't have  a weapon on him  he was just  walking to fucking  we all know  what he was doing  and where he was  going  and I find that  believable  I find it believable  he was just walking  with this stuff  going home  Zimmerman 
[01:19:00]  made a mistake  he was not there  to commit a problem  how about  let's say some guy  with a big bushy  red beard  and a fucking  beanie  is robbing  apartments in your  building  rob 12 apartments  in your building  people have seen  I would say  get that red headed  Jew  and then you  see some  you know about  this  you see some  guy in your  building  that fits  that description  are you not  gonna  is it not  even gonna  enter 
[01:19:30]  your great  open thinking  mind  that you  aren't gonna  look at him  and go  that could  be the  motherfucker  that's robbing  my building  and what  are you gonna  do  that's why  I said  even  call the cops  understand why  everybody knows  so how  was he so  wrong  in calling  the police  and thinking  perhaps he was  up to no good  because  he wasn't  I'm not saying  again the world  we should live in  the one we do  live in  okay  but it's  like we say  that  and I say it  too  but like when  it's the other 
[01:20:00]  way and it's  something that  enrages me  I can't  I'm not that  casual about it  like hey  that's the world  we live in  like I feel  that way  if  if something  that I believe  in is being  put forth  but if  something  that I don't  like is being  put forth  on me  it's much  harder  for me  to say  well now that's you  isn't it  yeah I can't speak  from it  I understand  what you're saying  I just don't  agree with the fact  that this profiling  thing is a bad  word  dude I don't even  agree  but I agree  with profiling  in airports  I fucking agree  with it  right right  and I agree  with the honesty  behind it  and there's 
[01:20:30]  a way to do it  I think  when police do it  that as long as  you're dignified  and respectful  when you fly  LL Airlines  they profile  I have the fuck  out of you  I've never once  said profiling  was terrible  or evil  I'm for the  stop and frisks  by police  right  not by guys  who don't have  whatever that  extra thing is  that caused  this to happen  where chances  are  if it was a cop  it would have been  less likely to happen  and believe  they've shot  unarmed people  too  well the authority 
[01:21:00]  figure of a cop  I don't think  Trayvon would have  done shit  I don't think  he's going to be  punching a cop  in the face  that is looking  at him  but a resident  of that neighborhood  gets out of his truck  and is looking  to see where  this kid's going  where he's going  he's not  there's no evidence  of confrontation  there's no evidence  he's stalking  pursuing  chasing down  hunting  none of that  he wanted to  keep an eye 
[01:21:30]  on this guy  because as he said  Todd  they always get away  they always get away  so he wanted to  keep an eye on him  the cops were  on their way  he knew  why would you be up  to fucking shenanigans  that I'm going to  hunt this kid down  and shoot him  when you know  the cops that you  called  are on the way  instead of going  I'm not going to  hunt him down  but I want to keep  a fucking eye on him  so when the cops  come I can go  there  that guy  I understand that  I understand that  but isn't there  a middle ground  between hunting him  down and shooting him  and defending his life 
[01:22:00]  like couldn't he  have just been in a  situation where he  panicked and shot him  he didn't have to  shoot him  all of this could  have happened  things  yeah but the  evidence doesn't  dictate that  the evidence that  that's presented  the witnesses  his testimony  against the  forensic evidence  and the witnesses  all of it's put  in a pile  and what it says  is  he  was he following  him  probably  and as far as  evidence goes  there's no  sign of that  but I truly  do believe  yes  he was following  was he going 
[01:22:30]  down the street  to look for the  street name  and stuff  I don't think  so  that's a lie  I don't think so  right  I think he was  keeping an eye on him  was he hunting him  no  I think he was  looking  and you gotta look  at past  you know  the past record  he's done this  before  he's called the  cops on people  before  but he's never  chased down  hunted  stalked  he's keeping  an eye  right  you're right  and like he said  these punks  always get away  he's never done it 
[01:23:00]  before  and the prosecutor  again  which I think  we talked about  I thought made  some good  emotional points  but again  the facts  he just doesn't  I understand  the prosecutor  emotionally did a good job  but what he said  he didn't want  was not going to  let this happen anymore  that's what was  happening that night  we all know  what was happening  that night  but my take on this  is a lot different  than my take on  Fat Nick  Fat Nick and those guys  profiled those black guys  in their neighborhood  who were there  to rob cars  and I 100% was glad  that Fat Nick 
[01:23:30]  fucking bashed  that guy with a pipe  this is not me being  oh my god  the poor young man  how could you ever  I get it  but you better be  fucking right  but you better be right  when you clock someone  in the head with a pipe  I understand that  you don't have to be right  to keep an eye on someone  that you just called  the cops on  until the cops get there  there's nothing in that  that is confrontational  that is evil  that is illegal  to watch somebody  that fits a profile  of people that have been  breaking into houses 
[01:24:00]  to watch them  until the cops come  what is so wrong  with that  what is wrong  with that  is  you're not giving  Trayvon Martin  and I understand  believe me  I know on paper  that looks great  technically nothing  but why is  everything from  Zimmerman's point of view  why is none of it  this guy was walking home  he's not going  well they've had  some robberies here  of course he's going  to look at  he is a black dude  walking home 
[01:24:30]  is not looking at himself  like white people  on the outside  going of course  they're going to look  at me a certain way  there's been robberies  here for Pete's sake  he's just a dude  walking home  and that may be  confrontational to him  because he doesn't  know why he's  being followed  he's being followed  and like  you know  again  he's being looked at  but again  there's a big difference  we all agree  I think he was being  followed  which is why  and again  I'm not saying  that's a crime  when he turned  down the sidewalk  to go to his house  if he kept going  we never would have  even heard about this 
[01:25:00]  if Zimmerman waited  in his car  we never  I mean both  exactly  but Zimmerman  didn't follow him  at that point  Trayvon turned around  he had to have  turned around  and come back  to the point  where he met up  with Zimmerman  and then  whatever happened  happened  but he could have  gone home  but you don't believe  certain important facts  either  like you don't believe  that he got out  to look at the street  which there was  three streets  and by the way  important facts  you could say  the prosecution  was pointing those out 
[01:25:30]  they're not grave  fucking problems  with the case  I think that  that says something  about  again I don't think  he intended to murder  the guy  or stalk him  I don't think  that at all  but I do  not discount  that he may have  been ready  to be confrontational  and go  what you're waiting  here  I don't discount  that  and I think  him getting out  of that  again I know  it's speculation  I'm not saying  no one heard  any raised voices  or anything  up until  help help help  no one heard  any hey  hey you're gonna  wait here  fuck you 
[01:26:00]  no one heard  two different  voices  you know  you've heard  arguments out  in the fucking  alley  in the city  around here  there was no  arguments  there was none  of this  everything  is indicative  of George  Zimmerman  being punched  in the face  out of surprise  that's  if he lied  about  he lied  this is what  the things  I think  you and I  both think  that he's  bullshitting  about  why he  get out  of that  car  I don't know  if Trayvon  was circling  his car  I don't know  if I buy 
[01:26:30]  that  I certainly  don't believe  you're gonna  die tonight  hand over the  mouth  and I just  don't  buy it  and I don't  fucking buy  the way the  gun came out  and again I know  I don't have to  buy it  I don't believe  that Trayvon  was grabbed  in the dark  like that  I just don't  believe  that he saw  that and was  grabbing for it  you're gonna die  I think that  Zimmerman was  giving a reason  that again  he had a  certain knowledge  of the law  and he knew 
[01:27:00]  that those  were things  legally he had  to say  he's not a  dummy  yeah  I firmly  do not believe  those things  I do believe  Trayvon might have  struck him first  I do believe  he was on top  of Zimmerman  I do believe  he was kicking  George Zimmerman's  ass  yeah  like I believe  a lot of that  stuff  I don't think  that he just  hunted this  innocent kid  down  and murdered  well that's  the bulk  of the case  right there  though  if you believe  that he didn't  hunt this kid  down  and you believe  that he was  punched in the  face  and on the  ground  with Trayvon  on top of him 
[01:27:30]  punching him  that's the case  but I don't know  that he didn't  punch for it  and I know  they can't prove  that  oh they can't  absolutely  him getting out  of the  and there's no  indication that  he laid a hand  on Trayvon  no no I know  but just because  Trayvon's on top  of him and  hitting him  yeah  that doesn't mean  he can shoot him  like that's not  the whole case  that is the whole  that is the whole  case  is that life  threatening  if somebody's  on top of you  if he felt  if George Zimmerman  felt that his  life was being  threatened at  that moment  or great bodily 
[01:28:00]  harm to himself  at that moment  and he said  he felt like  it felt like  my head was  going to explode  he was hitting  it against the  concrete  he's punching  him in the  face  if he thought  I'm going  to pass out  I'm going  to you know  and then  I do have a  weapon on me  he could grab  it  he could shoot  like all of  this adds up  to George Zimmerman  thinking  this guy  could kill me  I have an honest  belief in my head  and that's all  the jury has to  think  is if I was  in that position  would I also  feel that my  life was being  threatened at that 
[01:28:30]  moment  that's the case  I agree with you  and again that's  why I don't think  he's a second  degree murderer  I do believe  I do believe  that he felt  very threatened  at that moment  and I do  believe he was  scared  I do believe  he was getting  his ass  I agree with you  on that  it's not like  why did he  shoot at that  moment  but do you  understand also  if you put  yourself in  that situation  where you're  feeling like  your life is  being threatened  it's still  self defense  except if  it gets a little  sketchier if you  threw the first  punch  well how about  if you as a 
[01:29:00]  guy  approach somebody  again aggressively  not yelling and  screaming  but what  again which is  to me those  things might go  into the motives  is why did he  lie about why  he got out of  that fucking car  why did he say  exactly the right  thing he'd have  to say when  anybody who's  had common  experiences knows  that's just not  a believable thing  covering his nose  pinching his nose  what the fuck  come on  no one ever  said  first of all  the prosecution  said that he  put his  hand over his  mouth and  pinched his 
[01:29:30]  nose  George Zimmerman  just said he  was trying to  suffocate me  okay so you  could do that  with one hand  absolutely  or you could be  hitting someone  and at one point  try to hold  their head down  and not even  trying to  suffocate him  but your hand  is just over  a nose and  mouth for a  second but to  you you're like  oh my god he's  trying to like  in in those  moments it's very  fluid it's very  fast it's it's  very violent  there's not this  when when you  watch the  prosecution  straddle that 
[01:30:00]  doll that they  have that  fucking mannequin  thing and  and they they  go okay so he  was like this  now how does he  get to the gun  if he said  no one's sitting  still during a  fight like that  you're squirming  twisting arms are  moving you're  grabbing you can  arch your back you  could move the  guy's thing you  could grab at  your gun you  could fucking  they make it  like they were  just stiff  if the jury  thinks that  Trayvon was  kicking his  ass because I  agree with Jim  I think he was  definitely beating  him up because  he had his 
[01:30:30]  marks on his  face there was  a confrontation  but if the jury  thinks that he  that Zimmerman was  getting beaten  up but the  Trayvon didn't  reach for the  gun and he  wasn't trying to  suffocate him  and that Zimmerman  shot him because  he was scared  not because his  life was actually  threatened but  because he  panicked in the  moment is that  manslaughter or  is that who's  gonna who's the  thing is who's  gonna assess how  he felt at that  moment George  Zimmerman knows  how he felt the  jury then has to  say with all the  evidence is it  reasonable reasonable  to believe that 
[01:31:00]  George Zimmerman felt  that his life was  in danger at that  moment he pulled  that trigger and  everything points to  yes and you have  to you have to  agree with  Zimmerman at that  moment unless you  could find something  that counters it  because he reason a  reasonable person  would believe that  his life is being  threatened the case  is over it's  why I was done  it's why even  though I do think  that you're probably  right he probably  will get an  acquittal unless  unless the  prosecution just  hits them on an  emotional level I  do think he'll be 
[01:31:30]  acquitted you know  what when when the  judge gives the  instructions to the  jury there things  like emotion that  they they tell them  facts let's stick to  these they do  here's what happened  and then when you  read the statutes  and then read what  happened it's this  one is so it's not  as close as everyone  thinks it is but  there's so we say  emotion could come  into play on close  cases I understand  that he was acquitted  yeah I know that was  pure emotion like  everybody knew he did 
[01:32:00]  it every but even  though they gave that  stupid glove move gave  the jury that teeny  yeah one inch window  to slither through and  go up a little bit of  doubt but that's just  it how do you know  that that prosecutor  going over uh  something and raising  these questions these  circumstantial questions  might not give this  jury that one little  fucking bit that they  need to go you know  what I don't believe  well that's why it's  not a hundred percent  you never know what  the jury but they're  supposed to assess the  facts uh when when 
[01:32:30]  the prosecution is  giving scenarios that's  that's what the defense  is yeah I know the  the prosecution was  raising reasonable  doubt they're supposed  to have their case  their facts their  timeline of everything  that's happened and  and then present that  to the jury and go  here's what happened  now the defense is  then supposed to go  and try to try to  cast doubt on what  the prosecution has  brought and go look  that happened like  that but it could  couldn't it have  happened this way  it's the opposite with  this case the defense 
[01:33:00]  is going here's what  happened every bit of  evidence dictates this  this this this and the  prosecution's going  well couldn't that  happen well if you're  saying couldn't it  have that's called  doubt and that the  jury has to fucking  throw it out when's  the last time you  met a rose is here by  the way  when's the last time  you met a wannabe  cop that you liked  look but seriously  when is the last time  you met one of these  security guy wannabe  cops whose judgment  you thought was  terrific  I agree 
[01:33:30]  and again again I  know Zimmerman's  brother's lawyer is a  fan of the show and  I actually like him  but you're looking at  Zimmerman in court  and again I know you  can't judge a book by  its cover but fuck  it we all do it  George he did so I  will too  you look at him and  I just don't buy it  I don't believe him  I don't think he's  again I don't think  he's out to murder  him but I think  people are defending  Zimmerman I'm not  saying you don't  believe what you're  saying but I just  think people kind of  like the way blacks  are immediately saying  justice for Trayvon 
[01:34:00]  there's a bigger picture  that they're looking  at or a bigger  emotion I think people  are defending Zimmerman  on a bigger thing and  a bigger emotion  absolutely I agree  with you I think if  he was so obviously  guilty that you  wouldn't defend him  but I think there's  enough room in there  and enough stuff where  you can honestly make  a great case for I  believe this guy even  though I think deep  down you know that  he's fucking full of  shit on some level you  know he's lying about  this and you know he  lied about I don't  believe some fucking  maybe Trayvon was not  a great kid but in the 
[01:34:30]  black community with  17 year olds and gangs  I don't classify a 17  year old who got  suspended for fighting  and has never been  arrested or never been  to jail as a thug like  that just doesn't fit  what we think well  then I want to be  thug what's worse  want to be cop or  want to be thug  want to be cop because  he's a gun Jesus  want to be thug talk  shit by the way  want to be thug so  did Trayvon he had a  fucking gun I that  isn't with him not  with him no but I  say he had a fucking 
[01:35:00]  gun he was looking for  he was looking to buy  and sell guns it's  pictures of him with  fucking illegal guns  I think Jim Jim  made a good point  about the conception  that people have like  what you said about  when's the last time  he met a wannabe cop  that you actually knew  what the fuck he was  talking about it's like  I really think that's  the biggest incriminating  not incriminating but  in the sense of the law  but like what is getting  Zimmerman more crucified  than maybe he justly  deserves you know  according to your 
[01:35:30]  opinion on the case  I think it's it's that  phone call man like  when he made that  phone call and you  could hear like the  fucking seething anger  in his voice and  going I'm so sick of  these punks and  whatever that immediately  sounds like he's got a  hard on to fucking go  at this kid and I  think that's the thing  that makes I think of  that if that tone and  those statements weren't  made in that initial  phone call people would  give him a little more  leeway in this and go  all right well maybe this  is you know maybe went  like this maybe like that  but when you when you 
[01:36:00]  have that it sounds  almost premeditated when  you hear that when you  hear that phone well  that's what the  prosecution's going for  yeah and it's I but  I'm saying like I don't  even know what my  opinion is on this case  because it's very  confusing I hear both  sides of it and I go  that's right no that's  right no that's right no  that's right but I do  think why so many people  aren't giving Zimmerman  the at least bit of  open-mindedness that  you're requesting is just  because of that like they  hear that and they go  this fucking guy had it 
[01:36:30]  out for this kid we can  hear it in his voice  that's a great point um  I hate to say that to  Joe but that's a great  but it really is like  all of a sudden it's  like you the the phone  call these fucking or  these fucking punks  always get away yeah  that's and that's not  you you could say yeah  that meant he was gonna  watch him but that is  the tone of an  aggressive this is not  going to happen tonight  and yet for some reason  Trayvon Martin's painted 
[01:37:00]  and I understand what the  evidence you know but  there's just something  there that is not making  sense just it's just  bullshit to me and you  look at this guy and you  fucking the fact that he  if he had never made a  911 call before or  Trayvon had a fucking  crowbar in his pocket  yeah but he didn't he  profiled him wrong but  that's his see he he  called 911 so many times  because that was the  duties that you know he  was appointed to be the  guy that calls 911 he's  the neighborhood rat he's 
[01:37:30]  the guy that has to go  around and if he sees  somebody he chose to he  chose to whatever wanted  to whatever it's it's the  position he was put in and  everyone knew about it he  wasn't just the the guy  that's calling 911 so he  did and and after calling  911 that many times and  those fucking punks did get  away and that asshole did  fucking take off why aren't  you gonna be mad and be  like fuck man so so it  doesn't mean that you go  from by the way never 
[01:38:00]  before having any problems  with you know chasing or  confronting to the one time  he's gonna go from zero to  fucking 180 and and chase  down someone or does it make  more sense he's like I  fucking assholes always get  away I'm gonna get out of  my truck I'm gonna keep my  eye on this fuck until the  cops come around that  corner and I'll go there he  is I think there's a third  option I think there's a  third option and that is  sharknado uh yes I think  that he was hoping a storm  would swoop this young man 
[01:38:30]  up wasn't it raining too by  the way uh yeah which is  another reason good reason  I have a hoodie on very  dark very rainy yeah yeah I  mean he was he was simply  wrong the third option I  think is that he didn't you  know he he was going to  confront him or stop him but  not uh on the on the level  of maybe throwing a fucking  gun butt at his nose I don't  think he was going to stop  him I don't think he was  going to even confront him I  don't think he was going to  get near him I think he wanted  to watch him he had called the 
[01:39:00]  cops already sure why is he  going to get into a  confrontation with somebody  he's waiting for the cops they  could be there literally any  second once and he's watching  that that's but that's but  that's exactly why I brought up  the thing about that phone call  it's like you're right why  would he it doesn't make  sense why wouldn't you keep  your distance but when a guy  goes these punks always get  away and you hear the anger  he sounds eager in that phone  call to shoot his gun for the  first no he sounds like no way  you don't even know how a 
[01:39:30]  fucking legal law-abiding gun  owner fucking reacts well  there's there's a guy had a  gun he never fucking pulled it  out there was no reports in  brandishing it fucking pistol  whipping any body but I'm I'm  saying you there's an there's  an eagerness in his voice and  that sounds great and then  also again it's to not have  this kid get away which means  it doesn't have to mean chase  him down and beat him and  tackle it could mean why can't  it just mean watching him until  the cops get there because you 
[01:40:00]  can then point out no he didn't  because he got punched in the  fucking face well but now now  just explain one thing to me  because the way I understand the  cases as we consider it gay  because they have a car if  George Zimmerman got an  erection during the scum yes  oh boy is that gay now here's  the thing you guys have already  said and I apologize I'm coming 
[01:40:30]  in late to this and also I'm not  following this as to the extent  that you are but I know that he  got out of his car and I know  that he approached the kid so if  he was just watching him why did he  do that why did he approach him  why wouldn't he just stay I mean  look I've seen people follow  people in the movies I've never  done it in real life but you sort  of stay a block away he didn't  approach him that that's wrong it  never happened like what what was  he got out of his car after  Trayvon took off Trayvon takes off 
[01:41:00]  he runs around the corner to the to  the right down this the sidewalk and  then a T off he runs out and then he  runs between some buildings two of  the buildings Zimmerman then gets  out of his car because he lost  sight of him he wants to again keep  his eye on this fucker until the  cops get there he gets out of his  car at that point doesn't approach  him never walked up to him he then  walks down the T as he said to see  what the street name was he's lying  there that's a lie yeah yes yes okay 
[01:41:30]  a lie so so then he gets out of the  car the operator on the other end not  even nine-one-one-non-emergency  police operator asks are you are you  following him and George says yes and  they go we okay we don't need you to  do that and the operator testified  that's for George Zimmerman safety they  don't want him you know getting in  anybody's face so he goes okay he said  okay and he wasn't following him he 
[01:42:00]  didn't make the right turn down the  condos to follow him he went straight to  where the street was where he said he  needed to see the sign for the street  name which Jimmy doesn't believe in  anything you know I don't think so  either but I think it was again  keeping an eye on him okay but can I  stop you for yeah yeah yeah we don't  need you to do that yeah go the fuck  home just go the fuck home no that  doesn't mean I have a friend I well  here's my here's my thing yeah I have a  friend who was a detective for the NYPD  whatever he just retired I told him a 
[01:42:30]  story one night or I go I feel I feel  like such a piece of shit and he goes  why and I go dude I saw I walked by  some housing projects tonight I saw a  dude grab his girlfriend who was trying  to leave him she was walking out of the  building where she gets he grabbed her  and threw her face down onto the  fucking pavement and she was crying and I  go and I didn't do anything to stop him  and he goes dude you never get involved  you call the fucking cops and you walk 
[01:43:00]  the fuck away and that's the end of  your duty as a citizen yeah so if the  cops are saying we don't need you to  fire cops didn't say that's a big  operator the operator who is a fucking  operator law enforcement said we don't  need you to do that because we don't  want you getting hurt right here it is  this and I know this is legal wrangling  but this is what they're fucking saying  he then turned around and started coming  back walking back to his truck okay when  he got to the T part where Trayvon made  that that turn to the left as they were 
[01:43:30]  walking up there's Trayvon he now why  the fuck didn't Trayvon continue on that  fucking course his house is at the end of  that sidewalk so he could have continued  going he either stopped or went and  turned back around came up to the T  where George is now coming back to his  truck and was like you following me why  isn't George still on the 9-1-1 call  they had hung up why I don't know again  it's hung up I think 9-1-1 did go to the 
[01:44:00]  cops hung up on him the cops will be  there why did he stay on the phone with  them and continue to give updates as to  where this guy would have been nice  wouldn't it but I mean yeah but that's  kind of what you're supposed to do I  think yeah if you're truly trying to  alert well if you're an operator you  would stay on the line you can't you're  not hey where you know right the  operator I don't remember hearing the  operator hang up on him  I want to hear that part of the jury's  going to want to hear that too so so he  walks back as Trayvon approach it  approaches him right because he should 
[01:44:30]  have been home at that point Trayvon but  he came back and said oh you following  me right and Zimmerman said no he goes  you got a problem and Zimmerman goes no he  goes well you do now BAM  Colcox him in the face Zimmerman goes  down Trayvon gets on top of him  starts punching him in the face  hitting his head against the sidewalk  now this is hearsay there's no proof  that this was the actual conversation  obviously right record this is the but  maybe the conversation was and this is 
[01:45:00]  where the gray areas for me maybe maybe  the conversation was are you following  me yeah I'm fucking following you because  I'm sick of you fucking punks always  getting away with the shit you're  pulling around here stop fucking follow  me no fuck you the cops are coming now  we're fighting that's fine who wait  wait you could say that right I could  say that to you right now right until  you punch me there's been no violence  the only evidence physical evidence  that anyone was hit is Zimmerman's face  so ah okay who hit first so a 
[01:45:30]  confrontation can be verbal or the  following but following isn't illegal  telling someone who the fuck are you and  what you're doing in my neighborhood  isn't illegal either right and it isn't  grounds to punch someone in the fucking face  but it is confrontational and it is in a  situation like that aggressive what are  you doing around here could be but but  again there isn't any of that what are  you doing around here there's no evidence  understand you can speculate all you want  the jury cannot base their decision on 
[01:46:00]  whether he was acting in self-defense on  on some prosecution speculation as to what  might have been said here's what was said to  the jury here's what the court knows  what was said what George Zimmerman says  was right but sorry on the flip side you're  you're comfortable bringing in evidence  about what Trayvon Martin was like in his  personal life things that like oh yeah yeah  yeah yeah but they didn't but so I'm  saying like you're weighing all that I  said that would have been yeah it would  have been great for the defense if they  were able to bring his past his text 
[01:46:30]  messages his pictures from his phone  which show a penchant for fighting and  text that describe how he got on top of  somebody in school and was punching him  in the fucking face and I do yeah but  again I agree that that he was doing  that but Zimmerman simply if you're  profiling somebody and they're not  doing what you think they're doing you've  profiled them wrong you have you've  made a mistake only know that after the  fact yes that's why if you're going to 
[01:47:00]  do it and you're going to actively be  involved in that you better know what the  fuck you're doing he knew enough of what  he was doing to keep an eye on someone  he thought looked a little iffy in the  neighborhood that's all right and if if  Trayvon decided to not go home and turn  around and confront this guy and punch  punch a guy that sorry he didn't know he  had a gun punch him in the face ah so be  it boy you picked the wrong motherfucker 
[01:47:30]  that night but you see it's like all of  that is like without Zimmerman spotting him  and starting this this this doesn't  isn't Trayvon Martin did nothing you're  right nothing wrong to inspire this from  Zimmerman so you're giving Zimmerman almost  a pass like hey he had a gun that guy  didn't know it was coming instead of  looking at Zimmerman going hey fuckhead he  was just walking home you thought he was  something that he wasn't he was just  walking home but Zimmerman was watching and  nothing happened right up until he was 
[01:48:00]  punched in the face the logical thing  though is after 10 9-1-1 phone call  whatever it was and then like Joe said  the tone of this call it's it's it's all  of a sudden he's just mr. sheepish and  ah shucks ah gee whiz where you going  fella like all of a sudden he's the  sheepish guy who got punched meanwhile he  thinks Trayvon's a thug he thinks he's a  criminal so or why does he just all of a  sudden walk up all innocent and ah gee with 
[01:48:30]  his hands at his side ready didn't walk  up no no but if Trayvon punched him it  walked up to him why doesn't Zimmerman  who everyone is saying is a pussy have  his fucking hand on his pistol or even  not saying pull it out I know the law is  weird this guy wanted to have him held  there he wanted the oh good job by the  yeah yeah he wanted that good job you  know what he might think I really think  what happened was he's a fake fucking  cop and I look at anything I say I say  with respect to both families because 
[01:49:00]  either either shut your face both  families  no one do you think they're gonna be in  court talking about you  fucking throw my coffee on you  with respect to both families why don't  you say rest in peace when you mention a  dead guy  all the respect to the call the own  family  who do you think you're talking to 
[01:49:30]  I forgot what show I was on  I was doing AM radio yesterday  NPR and I mean this with all the respect  you need a bag of shit  listen here's the thing it's uh what I  think is I think I think this guy is a  wannabe cop I think if you want to be a  cop go be a fucking cop I think he's a  he's a he wanted to like Jim said he 
[01:50:00]  wanted to pat on the back and all that  stuff I think he followed this kid  around this kid got pissed off about it  there's apparently you know record not  record but you know the Trayvon saying  like see this guy's following me what  the fuck or whatever it pissed Trayvon  off Trayvon walked toward him said  dude what the fuck's your problem why  you follow me Zimmerman ran his mouth  and the big tough guy got his fucking  ass kicked by a 17 year old kid and  when he was on the ground going oh  shit I bit off way more than I can 
[01:50:30]  fucking chew I'm gonna just fuck I'm  gonna shoot this guy you know and I  also think that the him his shooting of  him was uh was was was passion it was  it was I think he was sitting there  going you motherfucker you know what I  mean think that came through the panic  of being absolutely fucking beaten  absolutely and I'll tell you I'll tell  you I'll tell you why I believe that  okay because um I I know seven I 17 year 
[01:51:00]  old kid kids period minors um they  understand what they can get away with  now they understand that they can say to  a parent for example you know fuck you  yeah I mean I have a nephew that lives  with my aunt who's his grandma um  because custody was taken away from my  cousin and he was you got three seconds  with the story to make it relevant it's  gotta be relevant you're on irrelevance yes  my point is  my point is I love is this is my favorite 
[01:51:30]  part of a get tragedy I woke up at 430  and drove two hours as soon as I got  here I'm just getting smashed all right  getting fucking I just don't like your  personal touch fucking attitude you know my  aunt has this who gives a fuck no here's  my point here's my point like it there  there's an anger that comes out of what  kids get away with these days you know my 
[01:52:00]  my nephew says to his grandma fuck you I'm  gonna do what I want and you know what I  mean and he does what he wants and now  he lives on a farm for juvenile delinquents  you know but there's a frustration that  comes out of that so there's that coupled  with this guy wanting to be the good guy  wanting to be the cop coupled with I  want to protect my neighborhood coupled  with potentially a little bit of racism  so yes I do think all that comes through  when that kid is on top of you beating  the shit out of you you're going these  fucking kids this fucking kids gonna get 
[01:52:30]  away with this because he's a minor these  fucking black guys this fucking  neighborhood god damn it and yeah I  absolutely absolutely think that that  would come through I think it's more  likely that he panic I think panic I  think he pays on the ground his life  probably wasn't in danger because like  even if if you said Trayvon had text  about you know being on top of somebody  beating them up before yeah he didn't  kill him well so his life wasn't in  danger so he starts panicking like oh I  didn't see this coming and doesn't know  what to do because he's not he's probably  not a great fighter and he shoots the 
[01:53:00]  kid and then goes oh shit well I just  do but I think that speaks to my point  even more if his life wasn't really in  danger right it's not panic at that  point it's fucking rage it's passion  it's it's fucking gritting your teeth  and going up sick and tired I mean look  this is a theory obviously when you're  getting beaten up I think that I think  in those moments I don't think you're  as logical like I think yeah like I  don't think Trayvon is thinking I think  in those moments where you're just  with a real confrontation I just think  squirming to get away from he might  have thought he was gonna be killed you 
[01:53:30]  want it to stop as quickly as possible  and to to pull out a gun and shoot  someone to make that stop you gotta be  pretty fucking if you shoot somebody  out of panic yeah that's manslaughter  unless your life was really on the  line I think he was panicking but if  but if you you know what I mean but  they the jury would have to believe  that right aside from what Zimmerman  said that yes I felt my life was in  danger what do you think personally  don't take all the legal stuff  personally I think actually happened 
[01:54:00]  not what the jury should say based on  the evidence do you think that  something like we're saying like he  didn't see it coming he didn't hunt  him down but then he was in this  situation and he panicked and shot a  kid he didn't need to shoot I think  he got that's likely I think he got  cold cocked I think he didn't see it  coming I think it was on the ground  getting hit yeah and in that moment  whether it's panic in order to panic  right you have to have some fear of  something you're not just gonna like  panic that he's gonna fucking you know 
[01:54:30]  take my wallet or I'm but it's the  panic that he thought he was in danger  of getting grave bodily harm I'm not  saying that there I'm not saying that  there wasn't any panic involved  whatsoever what I'm saying is is  there are certain physical  confrontations where your preconceived  notions of a person could fuel your  behavior a little bit more that's all  I'm saying so in other words if you  you know Jim you told a story once on  here about that girl that that was you  were going out with that wouldn't let 
[01:55:00]  you go to sleep that night yeah and  you were like you said you went in  your kitchen you were like looking at  the knives you were so fucking angry  my point is is like the you you're  when you're staring at the knives in  your kitchen you're not going to do  anything obviously but when you stare  at those knives if I was at your  house arguing with you you wouldn't go  to that place there's no because it  obviously wouldn't be my house  god damn it it's coming out of my 
[01:55:30]  mouth I mean I know I know but you  know what I'm saying like there's  something fueling I understand you  going to that place and I think in  this instance of course there's panic  but you got it but I think more can  fuel it than just panic in this  situation I think of course you can I  think of George Zimmerman had let's  just say for argument's sake a white  guy on top of him that wasn't in a  hoodie he might have been less likely  to reach for that gun or freak the  fuck out maybe but if it if the  description of who was perpetrating all  these crimes was white guy all the time 
[01:56:00]  maybe then he wouldn't have to think  like that but I hate the blame going to  the fucking white guy because black  society has entered this fucking  unbelievably disproportionate crimes  right there you look at the bigger  picture and it represents this big  thing the reality is it's just these  two guys right and if he thinks this  guy's a criminal and this guy's a  threat and this dumb motherfucker and 
[01:56:30]  this is my major problem with him goes  through these steps and gets out of  this car license to carry a firearm and  is that ill-prepared to protect  himself mm-hmm then to me there is some  kind of a criminal negligence there  because again if Trayvon had punched  him through the car window I'd be a  hundred percent with Zimmerman if if  there was just there's something about  this I don't fucking believe it or if  he's telling the truth then he is such  an incompetent wannabe cop that learn 
[01:57:00]  with this cocksucker to carry a gun  again that's not illegal but to get  yourself in that situation to get  yourself in a situation I want to be  cop and you and you call up angry use  on the law enforcement terms and do  all this but all of a sudden you're  shy and sheepish when you approach I  just that doesn't want I don't think  he was trying to get into a  confrontation with you might be right I  don't think he was buddy but but if  that's not true or if he wasn't at 
[01:57:30]  least trying to follow him and go yeah  well wait a minute you're gonna wait  here not a confrontation I'm gonna  kick your ass but as a figure of  authority because he knows he has the  pistol he's lying about looking for the  street name we all know that's an  absolute fucking lie he's not looking  for the street name he's lying like  we there's certain things that we know  he's bullshitting about mm-hmm so  those we just wash over your case for  self-defense you know obviously he can't  say you know he's be if Trayvon's face 
[01:58:00]  was all beaten and his wasn't yeah you  obviously can't just say well he was  beating me but that's a that's a lie  this is all right I could bolster my  fucking self-defense story by saying  this is why I walked over here or that  what but again that doesn't reflect on  him being approached by Zim by Trayvon  Trayvon punching him in the face him  getting into a position where he feels  his life is threatening and shoot but  you automatically believe or maybe it's 
[01:58:30]  through the evidence please only through  the evidence yeah I don't know what to  believe I wasn't there no I mean that  that Trayvon was the agree and I know  that the marks on Zimmerman's face I  believe he was getting beat up mm-hmm but  if there was one mark on Trayvon one  mark I would think mother was well one  okay if there were two marks on him that  just means that could just mean that  George Zimmerman is an absolute pussy  that doesn't know how to fight exactly  yes it doesn't mean he's wrong in the  fight though you're right though exactly 
[01:59:00]  he doesn't know how to fight that's why  he felt his life was being threatened  but here's the thing it's like I could  I could get into a fight with Kenny and I  could beat on Kenny ten times as much as  Kenny beats on me I'm gonna have more  marks on me than Kenny has because I hit  like a little fucking quim the idea behind  self-defense and and defending your life by  taking someone else's has nothing to do  with how well you can fight how many  punches you took nothing no it doesn't it 
[01:59:30]  doesn't so you don't think some fucking  any reflection of it's your belief that  your life is ready to be taken or you're  gonna have great bodily harm done to you  it doesn't have this little sub note that  goes you better be able to fight now it's  that's all the lawyers did you feel like  you were gonna die yes thank you you didn't  you don't think some fucking pussy with a  fucking wannabe cop with a pistol who 
[02:00:00]  fight winds up shooting an innocent guy  again he was wrong his profile was it  right up until he punched him in the face  and that's all the whole thing that he he  pushed forward that entire and again I  understand the legality of it push forward  he on turned around but he could have  been home with his dad he could have been  but he's being followed and like a lot of  times you're being followed you don't  know what's going on how about you go  home to your former gang member dad and  he could help you beat the shit out of 
[02:00:30]  this guy you go home you fucking go home  that's fine but then how about Zimmerman  they got it under control go the fuck home  they didn't go the fuck home are you that  worried that one of your neighbors might  get a fucking bracelet stolen so I mean go  the fuck home that's the that's the wants  the pat on the back of course yes I'll  agree with you a hundred percent on that  Jimmy cops don't like this guy cops don't  fucking look at Zimmerman like wow this  guy was doing a terrific no cops look at  this guy like this most cops that I've  talked to I'm sure some don't agree with  this guy's like a fucking just a pussy 
[02:01:00]  boy getting himself involved and you know  it's like as much as I talk shit on the  radio I don't I don't fucking threaten  people or physically if I had a pistol I'd be  completely the end of that one call I'm  sorry but all right it's I am curious  and Zimmerman may have the 911 ever I  may have hung up I don't remember let's  hear a straight at the clubhouse and make  a left and then they go past okay just  let play from there my truck I was giving  instructions where he wants the cops to  be I don't know it's a cut through so I 
[02:01:30]  don't know the address okay do you live in  the area yeah yeah what's your apartment  number it's a home it's one nine five  zero oh crap I don't want to get it  allowed I don't know where this kid is  okay do you want to just be with them  right near the mailboxes them yeah it's  fine  he said he'll meet the cops  could you have him call me and I'll  tell him where I'm at okay yeah that's  oh right there why pause that real quick 
[02:02:00]  yeah I got it four of them why what do  you mean exactly call them and call me  exactly call on why call me and I'll tell  them where I'm at if he's going back to  his truck do you want him to do you want  them to meet you by the truck can you no  actually can I be more involved in this  can you have them call me so I can tell  you what because he's keeping an eye on  him oh no no but that doesn't go with 
[02:02:30]  hold on it doesn't go with he wasn't  following him uh-huh which I know is not  a crime and that doesn't go with I was  just going back to the truck I was just  going to get the address the 911 operator  asked him do you want them to meet you  in the truck right can you have them call  me so that's what he was doing there  was a big confusion earlier on to us to  where everything was like it didn't seem  like the operator knew where he was  talking about right we'll meet by the  clubhouse we'll meet by the mailboxes  we'll meet by my truck there was a lot of  confusion as to where he wanted to meet 
[02:03:00]  and that's why he wanted to talk directly  with the cops and tell them where he was  he wanted to talk directly with the cops  because this motherfucker is a wannabe cop  and he wants to be part of the group  that's all can you have them call me  direct who the fuck says that well  convict him then of wannabe cop in the  second degree I'm saying that like you know  just not a murder rap but but but I'm  saying that tells you something about  this guy that you know yeah we understand 
[02:03:30]  and circumstantial cases are built on stuff  like that you know what this guy is well  you know what Trayvon was too I know that  niggas face motherfucker read his texts  yeah motherfucker you want you want to go  in on a 380 you want to go in on a gun  but again he wound up dead and he was 17 years old  I don't care about his age I'll bring up a case  of a 17 year old that killed a motherfucker  with his bare fucking hands  I don't care but I'm talking about in this situation  you know I can bring up cases of 6 year old kids  shooting their 3 year old sisters with shotguns 
[02:04:00]  yeah misbehaving  well that's parents being very irresponsible  but I mean come on man  it's like a fucking teenager's a teenager  you remember what a dipshit you were when you were 17  I wasn't training buying and selling guns  and fucking drugs and fucking getting into fights  I tried to buy a gun when I was 14  does that mean I was a goddamn fucking murdering lunatic  Jim was lighting couches on fire  it's like you got lucky  you do dumb shit when you're young 
[02:04:30]  you gotta give a little leeway for that  if Jimmy's willing to say you know what this guy's all about  based on you know  ah you know what this guy's all about  you know what Trayvon was all about  he wasn't this innocent  fucking show us his 12 year old  when he was 12 his picture on the news  a saintly kid  no they're all saying that Joe  they're all saying that  I mean right here right now  you're not giving him any benefit of the doubt  I am too  but when you look at Zimmerman  you find like the parts where like 
[02:05:00]  no I understand that  yes but  but with Trayvon it's  it's the guy was  I don't count him as a thug  first of all talking shit in text  my text messages are an abomination  I understand  but if your text messages were an abomination  as to fighting  and trying to buy a gun  and shit  did he own a gun?  that would be different  it's iffy  no one wants to say anything  but there's pictures of him holding a gun  there's you know  but that's 
[02:05:30]  come on  I understand  I understand that fucking  but I  differentiate between him  kind of like  embracing that culture  or that idea  see now you're giving him the excuses  and not giving Zimmerman the benefit of the doubt  he's never been arrested  and it's really hard for me to picture  any fucking  especially with the gang  ex-gang member  any 17 year old black thug  who has never been arrested  that's a difficult  that's a difficult label 
[02:06:00]  for me to put  if he was 13  I would say  well maybe not yet  but when you're  when you're 17  and you've never been arrested  but you're a big fighter  and you're into guns  I find it hard to believe  that those two things  are murderers  that were never arrested too  even at that age  but not as many in that culture  not as many young black gangbangers  or black thugs  who weren't arrested  by the age of 17  well maybe he's a thug wannabe  look  yeah the wannabe label's thrown around  a lot  but he didn't have a gun on him  he's never been behaving  like a cop wannabe  by saying  have the police call me directly  he's behaving as a neighborhood watch guy 
[02:06:30]  he should have fucking  just went to target  and gone back home again  I understand  if I was  if I was driving in my car  okay  and I  with some guys  we got pulled over  and they found an eight ball  in the car  and they tried to make a case  that Joe DeRose  is a drug addict  I'm not a fucking drug addict  but people could come out  and go  I did blow with that dude once  or I smoked pot with him once  that doesn't mean  I'm a fucking drug addict  it means like  okay yeah  there's fingers that could point  in the direction that  maybe you could build a case 
[02:07:00]  theoretically  but it doesn't mean that  that's what I am  look at the fucking proof  raid my house  you're not gonna find a fucking  stitch of drugs  look at the proof  the guy  you have one guy with his face  completely beat in  you have one guy  without a scratch on him  except for a bullet hole  through his heart  and you got  the witnesses that said  I saw this guy  on top of this guy  and I heard  this guy  screaming help  and his statement  as I was saying help  and this guy  it corroborates  with other witnesses 
[02:07:30]  that had come out  so  but I'm not denying  any of that  but here's the thing  did he have a cut  in the back of his head  yeah I saw it  I saw the footage of that  did the  was the first place  they took him  was to the hospital  to get fixed up  because they do do that  even if you're in trouble  the cops will bring you  to the hospital  and fix you up  and they fucking didn't  no they didn't  so how bad  was the fucking cut  also on top of that  he's a bald headed guy  meaning like Jim  shaved fucking head  that cut looks  20 fucking times worse  because there's no  hair covering it  do you know 
[02:08:00]  what the extent  of injuries you need  for self defense  do I know what  do you know  what the extent  of injuries  a person needs  to claim self defense  no  none  zero  you don't even need  an injury  at all  okay  so it's  but then you walking  you could come at me  sideways down the hallway  coming back from the bathroom  later and I could shoot you  and go  I felt threatened  why'd you feel threatened  because Ant was walking  towards me  and I know how  how he thinks  I mean  you can make a case  for anything  it doesn't mean  it's a strong case  you're right 
[02:08:30]  you know what they would do  they'd check all the cameras  they'd check the witnesses  of the people in the station  they'd talk to people  as to what you were doing  and I was doing  before and after  it's not this one moment  where it's like  well George Zimmerman  and Trayvon were there  and they were alone  so that's all they got  is George Zimmerman's word  no  you got George Zimmerman's word  that has to be backed up  with every other piece of evidence  from that moment  and it does  it meshes  everything he said  about the confrontation  not I went here  to go look at a sign  or I went here  to go look down the sidewalk 
[02:09:00]  to see where that motherfucker was  fuck that  here's the thing  were you fucking  being attacked  by somebody else  when you  when you pulled that trigger  did you feel like  your life was being threatened  does it get backed up  by ear and eyewitnesses  and a tape from 911  from another apartment  and the gunshot  and the position  and all that  has to come together  you can't just say  I love that one  well I could walk  and say that you did this  and you shoot me  yeah  where  in a vacuum  okay fine  fine  so  what you just  based on everything 
[02:09:30]  you just said  boil this case down  to what it is  which I think we're doing  and at the end of the day  who gives a fuck then  to me  because who gives a fuck  because if you're not  going to talk about  if motivation  can't come into it  if  if preconceived notions  can't come into it  it can  if  well  but  but there's no proven  ill will  there's no proven  you don't think  that phone call  is proof enough  of ill will  or proof enough  of a preconceived notion  no  not ill will  towards one single person 
[02:10:00]  when he goes  these  these assholes  and  these motherfuckers  he's not pinpointing  one person  he's talking about  the group of people  that constantly  get away  if  and it's really  this is fucked up  and  this is just something  I believe  if he hadn't pluralized  that  there'd be a problem  he pluralized  assholes  he pluralized  motherfuckers  do you say  the word  asshole  and motherfucker  on a 911 call 
[02:10:30]  when you're not  angry  he's lumping  by doing that  he's pluralizing  he's lumping  them  and he wasn't  yes he was  but that is an  ill will  toward one person  but that's  but my point is  it's a big  Jimmy  it's huge difference  so if you say  huge  or not you  but if you say  I don't like that Jew  to a guy  a rabbi walking by  do you think that's  different as calling  I don't like fuck  I don't like Jews  yes  as far as  as far as  ill will  in a murder case  okay  yes it matters  okay  you need ill will 
[02:11:00]  toward a person  one person  yes  not a group of people  if that person  falls into the group  that you are talking about  it's not ill will  toward that person  doesn't the ill will  doesn't  isn't it  some of the actions  as well  doesn't  isn't ill will  isn't that just  one piece  of an ill will  puzzle  it has to be  it has to be  at the moment  at the moment  it can't be  beforehand  it can't be  even during the call  it's too far away  from the incident  it has to be 
[02:11:30]  at the incident  you need  ill will  hate  in order to  have that stick  I don't say  that he approached  him with hatred  either  and that's not  the point I make  anyway  and by the way  to anybody  who I block  on Twitter today  you're never  being unblocked  but I'm not  blocking people  for agreeing with you  there's plenty  most people  that agree with you  and I'm not  blocking any  if you're being  a cunt on Twitter  you're getting  blocked  and I'm never  unblocking you  by the way  this is a great  fucking discussion  and this is exactly  what will probably  happen in the jury room  you'll hear people  like batting this 
[02:12:00]  shit back and forth  but here's my  you never answer  my question  I'm sorry  and it's alright  you're all worked up  it's early in the morning  I know  Jesus  what  if  my point is  you call 9-1-1  9-1-1  I just  for argument's sake  I think it's a fair  statement to say  that when you call  9-1-1  okay  if you're a law  abiding  decent  upstanding  shirt and tie  suit and tie  citizen  like George Zimmerman  is supposedly  you don't use words  like asshole  and motherfucker  okay  unless  you are fucking 
[02:12:30]  angry  okay  that's my  so I'm saying  did you hear that part  of the call  yeah  because he doesn't  yell into the phone  and go  hey  hey  9-1-1  these assholes  these assholes  he's muttering  it's under his breath  he's going  oh  these fucking assholes  always get away  he's not  he's not  on the phone  you've never seen a guy  angrily mutter though  you know  my point is  that's not  I would never call 9-1-1  angry yelling  that's going on  and that  that does make a difference  there's not an angry  yelling in the phone 
[02:13:00]  these assholes  he's muttering  because you know why  because they always get away  that's why he's saying that  I'll say something  that I'm probably  going to get smashed for  I took an acting class once  and I said  I was yelling  in a scene  and the teacher said  why are you yelling  and I said  because it says  because I'm saying  I'm angry  and she goes  that doesn't mean  that you're yelling  anger can show itself  in many different ways  just because he wasn't yelling  doesn't mean he wasn't angry  my point is  is you don't call 
[02:13:30]  look as Jim said earlier  he's trying to be like  this all shucks guy  if you're the all shucks guy  you don't call 9-1-1  and say  motherfucker and asshole  unless  you're fucking seething  with anger  and we'll get it straight  it was the non-emergency call  you know what I mean  the call  I know  you know what I'm saying  and he did  he was  you could say angry  he was frustrated  the fucking guy  all these other times  these fucking  assholes get away  so he's muttering  as he's talking to the guy  he's trying to give him  the location  then he sees Trayvon 
[02:14:00]  take off between  two buildings  and he goes  oh fucking assholes  always get away  now he's got to  find a  it's frustration  you can hear  more frustration  in that voice  than anger  I will tell you this  when I saw that dude  dude I'm telling you  something  this dude grabbed  this chick  in front of this building  when I was in the east  on the lower east side  and slammed her  to the fucking  ground dude  her fucking teeth  and face  hit the ground  she was crying  like a six year old dude  and then 
[02:14:30]  she got up off the ground  cause he pulled her up  by her fucking hair  okay  I called  hot  nine  you did call  I called  I touched myself  and I  no  I called  nine one one  and  they were like  what's going on  I told them exactly  where I was  and I said  I'm standing  across the street  I will wait here  till the cops get here  what I didn't do  was go  these motherfuckers  always get away  with this shit  and I also 
[02:15:00]  didn't walk  into the fucking  project development  to try to track  where this fucking  guy was  if you were on  fucking  watch  bitches get the  shit beat out of them  detail  where you walked around  and watched it  and you had seen  maybe twelve or so  a dozen  guys beat their  girlfriends  and every time  the cops showed up  that you called  the cops on  the guy was gone  after a while  wouldn't you go  fucking  get the cops here  these fuckers  always get away  the difference is  Joe saw something  happening 
[02:15:30]  Zimmerman didn't  and  and  and  the people who  were saying  I should  I did chase  the bus  yes of course  I did  I thought  I saw  something  so I called  it in  but what I did  but what I did  was I eventually  just went away  in like  what if the bus  driver kicked  your ass  you dumb  motherfuckers  I wouldn't  have gotten  out of my car  the bus driver  never would have  kicked my ass  because I would  have zoomed  away  but what if  he  yeah what if  he came up  to you  like like 
[02:16:00]  the bus stops  you stop  and then all  of a sudden  he's like  at your passenger  window  I would have  been very  surprised  and I think  that as  reasonable  people  yeah  we see  the difference  between a guy  following you  in a dark  apartment complex  and in  Manhattan  a car  following a  bus  so to the  people on  Twitter  it's very  hard to  equate  to the people  on Twitter  can you  honestly  not see  the difference  it's just  funny to  equate it  and I love  that  of course  here's  here's my  here's  this is  just came 
[02:16:30]  up on  Twitter  and I  don't  know  it says  Zimmerman  has a  history  of  violence  is that  true  no  there  was  I  think  there  him  for  being 
[02:17:00]  stalkerish  or whatever  no  it wasn't  stalkerish  I guess  when you  go through  a lot  of times  when couples  break up  the woman  takes one  out on the  guy  the guy  takes one  out on the  it fucking  happens  and meanwhile  if it hadn't  been resolved  satisfactorily  they never  would have  given him  a pistol  license  so  you can't  get a gun  where it's  not disposed  of probably  I got pissed  by the way  badly  alright  let's take a  break  E-Rock  you got that  Jimmy  law abiding  Jimmy  I vibe 
[02:17:30]  on a  block  frenzy  by the  way  yeah  a lot  of you guys  make good  points  and I'm not  blocking you  for agreeing  with Ant  because Ant's  a genius  and I  love fucking  discussing stuff  with Jimmy  but if you're  being a cunt  and again  some of you  won't care  but don't  fucking email  me  fuck you  good  I love  blocking  I do  I'm a  faggot  I unblock  a lot of  people  who will  write  hey man  I'm just  you know  whatever 
[02:18:00]  I unblocked  one person  recently  from Pittsburgh  because he  just  wouldn't  fucking  stop  and I was  like  and his  crime  wasn't all  that bad  but I don't  unblock  anybody  anyone  once you're  done  because I  can't keep  track of  what I  blocked you  for  for the  most part  so I'm  just like  I'm only  going to  assume  it's the  worst  thing  I stopped  blocking  because I  took Twitter  off my  phone  because I  was always  looking at  it  so I  have to  do it  through the  safari  now  like I  just tried  to block  somebody  and the  safari  thing  won't let 
[02:18:30]  you block  so I  don't block  anybody  you took  Twitter off  your phone  because you  were just too  crazy  alright we'll  get it to  social media  next  Jimmy go  piss  we'll be  right back  I was  driving home  and I was  behind a  bus  you know  like the  bus has  an automatic  sign  911  call  police  I  call  911  911  I'm on  10th Avenue  northbound  and I'm  behind a  bus  and the  sign  says  911  I  didn't know  what was  happening  there could  have been  hostages  I mean  we all  saw that  Keanu Reeves 
[02:19:00]  movie  I'm on  the phone  with 911  and this  fucking  dummy  is where  where are  you now  I said  I'm  northbound  on 47th  Street  on 10th  Avenue  okay  you're  on  now  where  are  you  now  I said  48th  Street  where  are  you  now  49th  Street  northbound  the only way  you can go  on 10th  Avenue  we're so  irritated with  these dummies  so we make  the left  on 57th  Street  we go  down to  11th  Avenue  I go  look  he's  making  a left  on 11th  Avenue  it's  a yellow  light  so the bus  slows down  and then shoots  through the light  and leaves me at  the red light  I knew that the bus  did that on purpose  I'm like this guy  knows I'm behind him  now we're going  southbound again 
[02:19:30]  so I called back  no one is  emergency  so I just called  and no one is doing  anything  I'm following a stolen bus  I think  no one is doing it  how long is it taking  a squad car  on fucking 11th Avenue  so I pull up next to it  and it's really dark  on the bus  and I just see  there's a black dude  I'm on the phone  I'm like I'm looking  at the guy  and he's just a black dude  but he's not dressed  like a bus driver  and I know  that he's stealing  this bus  I'm northbound now  and he's behind me  and he's like  what street  I'm like  now we're passing  40th street  the woman was like  where was he before  10th and 11th  but then he came down  11th and now  we went up 10th 
[02:20:00]  he's probably going to  turn it off  because you're going to  lose him  follow him  you keep saying  10th and 11th  but 10th and 11th  are in parallel  what street and 11th  I know  he was on 10th  and then he went down  11th  so then I was just like  fuck this shit  and I drive away  and he pulls away  slowly  and starts to drive  and I'm like  you know what  he just turned it off  he just turned it off  we lost him  and he probably  turned into the  bus depot  the guys are back 
[02:20:30]  from the toilet  and now  back to our show  the OPNF show  wow  that was exhausting  our little debate  I guess  O'Mara's delivering  the defense's  closing arguments  right now  you know Ann  I always say  the art of conversation  is dead  and I like  what a couple of  I wish you were 
[02:21:00]  the art of conversation  Jesus  I was kidding  I was kidding  I was being  a fucking smart ass  I was only kidding  last time I saw you  it was my party  yeah  and wow  that was something  I don't remember  a lot of it  I know  yeah me neither  I got  pretty twisted  real fucked up  I showed up  I showed up  at midnight  you guys have been  going since  Christ knows when  yeah since  probably noon  so  I was already  12 hours in 
[02:21:30]  I said to somebody  when I walked in  I go it looks like  the fucking  end of awakenings  in this place  it looked like  the asylum  was just like  melting down  it was just  all coming apart  yeah  but you know  what  I want to say  hi to all the  compound  live from the  compound fans  because I sat  in there for a while  I never got so  many nice  things said to me  people were just  calling saying  such sweet stuff  I really mean that  it was very touching  yeah  yeah  very touching  that's a weird audience  it's not like here 
[02:22:00]  it's really different  I don't know why  they seem like  very gentle  and supportive  until a girl  walks in  and they're like  can you get that  cunt out of the frame  unless she's gonna  show her tits  I don't wanna  fucking see no  bitching  alright  I think they all did  I think every girl  was showing her tits  I know  I was just showing  tits  and I don't know  and then I leave  the fucking  camera on  and just walk away  anyone can do  whatever the fuck  they want  oh my god  you know who I  made up with that  was Fred from  Brooklyn  oh really  yeah we had that 
[02:22:30]  that was when I  took Twitter off my  phone because I  went so crazy  on him on Twitter  and I went nuts  and then  I forgot you guys  had a beef  yeah and I was like  what am I doing  I'm losing my shit  what's that  I was shitting who  Fred from Brooklyn  Fred from Brooklyn  and I had a really  bad exchange on  Twitter at one time  and that's where  I took Twitter off  my phone  I was like I'm  getting too involved  in Twitter  he's some guy  from Brooklyn  he was over at my  party and Joe  was there also  and they had some  kind of beef  so I guess they  made up at the  party  we made up  we hung out all 
[02:23:00]  night we had a  great time  that was a fun  party man  yeah it was  wow  I just know  I woke up  I was on  one of the  swim  one of the  fucking floaty  things in the  pool  yeah  I was like  fucking  this is so  nice  relaxing  and then people  kept trying to  wake me up  they're like  get up  you fucking  you know  yeah it's  dangerous  I'm like  nah  if you fall  off you wake  up  well there's  difference between  falling asleep  on a raft  and blacking  out on one  oh look at

[02:58:30]  prostitute story  for the post  a couple years back  I was booked on ONA  but the post wouldn't let me come  so that gives you an indication  of like what I could get away with  so I remember one time  I had some piece  that was about like  going to the Hamptons  and like  I don't know  like having sex  like five different times  like including on top  of the post  on like page six  which I thought was really  like poetic  and that was  with one person  no that was like  with 20 different  no yeah  it was with one person 
[02:59:00]  yeah  it's like five different times  like okay  yeah  alright  and I remember  my editor said  I don't know  the whole thing  just feels  kind of like this  over sexed weekend  so  isn't that what it's supposed to  so I like  kind of rewrote it  in this like  you know  it was like a fairy tale  oh boy  yeah  so  I kind of got my like  zombie Carrie Bradshaw  on  you know  that's ridiculous  this weekend at Bernie's  has too much dead guy in it 
[02:59:30]  yeah  can't you soften this up  a little bit  exactly  can't you make him  Bob Dole  so just his arm  isn't working  does it have to be  he's completely dead  what was like  your worst date  what was it  the worst one  the worst date  was the date  I went on  with a rapist  oh wow  we ate dinner  oh Jimmy  he didn't  he didn't  rape me  but  he is serving  I think like 15 years  oh real rapist  oh yeah  oh wow 
[03:00:00]  after  after my prestigious  my night with a prostitute  cover  I was on the cover  of the post  my date  with the Riverside  rapist  so I was like  really on a roll  you know  whoa  I just needed to have  like you know  my 20 abortions  was he  was it  was it a good date  no no no  so I wrote about him  in the dating column  yeah  it was love  like he's totally  I'm waiting for you baby  yeah  nice enough fella  no I wrote about him

[03:01:00]  and said  isn't this the dude  that you dated  who kept texting you  things after  when you blew him off  like  you are a sexy  brat provocateur  Jesus  which is kind of like  that's kind of a cool thing  gotta remember that one  sexy brat provocateur  provocateur  and so yeah  so I wrote about that  and then like 20 women  I keep saying the word  20  so I think  really  one of those numbers  is off  I'll say like 23  23 women  emailed me 
[03:01:30]  saying that they had  similar experiences  with the guy  and I forwarded him  on to the ADA  and then I had to like  talk to her  wow  but he took his dick out  yeah he took his dick out  and I didn't  okay so  I had to take  I had to take  just an angry dick  I had to take this out  I had to take this out  of  the piece that ran  but I was trying to be  like really  honest  you know  and he was really pushy  and sometimes as a woman  it's just better  to just let a guy 
[03:02:00]  oh man  so I let him like  jerk off on my back  you know  oh my god  in the park  wait in the park  yeah because he was like  he was like really aggressive  no no no  but check it out  that's fantastic  check it out  no no no no  love this guy  my omelet's getting fluffy  over here  okay in my defense  I mean this is kind of like  dark but  one of the women  who like resisted  she got punched  in the fucking face  oh man  so I think I made  the right choice there  so wait a minute  he was kissing you  but I had to take that 
[03:02:30]  out of the post column  because they said  it didn't pass  the breakfast test  well of course  well  Jimmy  wait a minute  so he was hitting on you  and being aggressive  and he was trying to have  and you knew that  it was going to get ugly  yeah it was just like  he was  I was just like  you know  I was like  resisting  but I mean it's not like  I  I could have run away  and  so like when I was talking  to the ADA  I was like 
[03:03:00]  it's not  you know  he didn't rape me  like I don't want to  testify against him  but he's like  a bad  aggressive guy  you know  how did you get  in the district  how do you tell someone  to jerk off on you  like I've jerked off  with girls  but like  I don't  I mean I don't remember  I mean like  I think that he just like  um  uh  I mean I probably  I think he was like  putting my hand  on  his dick  and I was like  you know  I'm not gonna like  blow you  I'm not gonna give you  a hand job  and I was like 
[03:03:30]  I think I was just like  do what you need to do  which is a really  romantic thing  when women say that  do what you need to do  that just got sad  that story got sad  I know  it's a dark story  and  the dude  the dude  the dude was black  and so  a lot of  yeah  big dick  huge  want to thank Mandy  for coming in today  but she won me back over  he had a big dick 
[03:04:00]  yeah  no I think that was like  the biggest dick  I've ever seen  probably  oh wow  and it was my first time  look at the guy sitting next to you  it was my first time  outside of  outside of  Joe DeRosa  obviously  right  I'm sorry  oh wow  fuck you  cut  no he wasn't saying  I have a big dick  he was saying  I'm the biggest dick  you've ever seen  oh that was like  a witty  use of words  yeah  he was giving me  a compliment  there is no compliment  ever sent my way  in this room 
[03:04:30]  always default  to insult  he was saying  that Joe DeRosa  is a big dick  not that Joe DeRosa  possesses a man's car  right  yeah no  in fact quite the contrary  I have big dick dar  which is  you can tell a guy  who has one  because he has  just like  completely unwarranted  confidence  wow  and like  so yeah  one of the last guys  I like  hooked up with  he was like  were you surprised  and I was like  no  because you totally  have just this like  maddening sense  of entitlement  that only guys 
[03:05:00]  would like  yeah  I agree  right  see  she has my back  yeah  guys that shouldn't  someone else  had your back too  came that over  apparently  I had a bad  it passed the  breakfast test  I dumped my  yogurt on it  guys that shouldn't  have confidence  but they'd  but do  yeah  yeah  so little scaredy  cat guys  like  Jesus Christ  little dicks 
[03:05:30]  I have so many  small dick signals  jumping off of me  I slouch  I have sloped  shoulders  look at the grass  belt buckle  yeah I think  I think that  sometimes  sometimes you can  have like a  micropenis  and still give off  like big dick  confidence  I guess because  you're like  fat fuck it  if you're so overcompensating  yeah  yeah you're like  ah fuck it  she's gonna find out  sooner or later  might as well just  play it up  I think little dicks  are hot  really you like a 
[03:06:00]  little dick  well no but I  just I don't like  discrimination  you know what I  mean  and so like  you know you can  have like anal  doesn't hurt  you know  oh there you go  that's nice  the guy wants to  hear that  fuck me in the  ass cause it  won't hurt  exactly  you're harmless  won't hurt  you fucking  half a man  you little  fucking  dick  shit  hey  hey don't  look on the  bright side  you won't hit  either one of my  roids  no guy wants to 
[03:06:30]  hear that  does uh  does uh  a big dick  and a small dick  like uh  get you off  equally as much  or what  well you know  I was with one  guy who had  like a coke  can dick  I call it  yeah he was  like um  he was one of  those like  he was one of  those like um  uh Jews  from  there's like  Africa  like my  my  my 
[03:07:00]  my  my theory  on uh  Jewish guys  is they either  have like  gigantic dicks  or little ones  ah  these the porn  stars with me  all of my  all of my  all of my  dick science  is totally  you're accurate  being verified  yes yes  so Jews  but yeah  it was  but so I don't  like yeah  like a massive  girth  yeah  why was it  called a  cocaine dick  did brown  stuff come out  of it  no that was  bubbles  wow 
[03:07:30]  no because  it was like  tasty and  refreshing  ah  there you go  nicely done  uh so they  could be  the biggest  much like  the Jews  noses  the same  thing  they could  have  big ones  or small  ones  oh way  to take  it from  a front  place  go into  actual  anti-semitism  yeah much like  those posters  I collect  from world  war 2  so speaking  of um  speaking of  hate speech  so after I  wrote about  the rapist  um because  he was black  I got letters 
[03:08:00]  that were  like um  you know  you're a  disgusting  uh coal  burner  I would  coal burner  I would  spit on  your um  maggot  infested  corpse  you'll never  date a white  man again  um  and then I  was on a  website  I've since  changed my  email  no that's  what I  I dated a  couple of the  guys but  yeah  wow so they 
[03:08:30]  were really  like uh  yeah  white guys  but yeah  it was kind  of dark  that was  kind of a  dark story  yeah  especially if  you let  do anything  I've done  out of fear  I feel bad  like if it  was just  dirty like  jerk off  on me  but if  it's like  if you're  really scared  it's like  depressing  yeah  it's great  like do  this or  you probably  get punched  in the face  yeah  wow  and you  didn't know  that at the  time like  you didn't  know he  had punched  women like  you you  you just  instinctively  sense this  guy's a  fucking  problem  yeah  I mean  like I  have a  pretty good  sense of  if someone  is like  legit 
[03:09:00]  kind of  dangerous  you know  and  yeah  that was  but that's  like using  your  like that  book  the gift  of fear  by Gavin  DeBecker  talks all  about like  fear and  using our  instincts  and not  that you  ever want  to be put  in that  position  but of  all scenarios  I mean  aside from  running away  and maybe  getting caught  of all  sexual  scenarios  that had  to happen  that was  probably  the one  that you  would have  gotten out  of  with the  least amount  of  coming  on  back  yeah  but I'm  saying  there's no  penetration  there's no  injury  what were  you wearing  yeah  that's  that is 
[03:09:30]  true  um  I was  wearing  hopefully  a park  after  you know  I was  wearing  the dress  that I was  trying to  find this  morning  to wear  because it's  my lucky  rapist  come on  the back  no but  it's like  got just  the right  amount  of cleavage  that's like  what's up  but I  couldn't  find it  is it  backless  I mean  that's  kind of  yeah  yeah  it's like  kind of  backless  and uh  but I  remember  going to  across the  street to  the Sherry  Niederlander  to like  wipe the 
[03:10:00]  comes down  clean up  a little  yeah  that's  scary  yeah  that's  creepy  it was an  awful night  yeah  what is  let me ask  you though  what got  you into  the park  with him  if you  sensed that  before  okay  um  well I mean  I was  kind of  drunk  like we  we met  for um  so I  met him  at the  apple  store  and  wait  that's  where  you  met him  and that's  where you  guys said  let's  meet there  no no  that was  how  that was  where he  hit on  me  was at  the  apple  store  oh man  yeah  and the  thing was  like he  said like  what do  you do 
[03:10:30]  and I  said I'm  a journalist  and he  said oh  my god  so am  I  and he  showed  me  his  website  which it  turned  out  he  was  like  rape  and  murder  let me  scroll  down  he  was  so he  was like  a complete  sociopath  he had  a fake  website up  where he  did like  the daily  show style  of editing  where you  know how  like they  can make  it look  as if  you're  interviewing  someone  so he  had  he was  like  he was  like  I  interviewed  bill  clinton 
[03:11:00]  I  interviewed  angelina  jolie  oh no  but it  was other  people  interviewing  him  and he  cut that  and he  sitting  there  so I  thought  he  was  like  a  legit  journalist  sure  sure  yeah  rape if  you put  so much  work into  it  jesus  it  seems like  i don't  know  if you  put  if you  put  industrial  light  magic  special  effects  and  green  screening  why are  you in  a brown  room  and clinton's  in a green  room  exactly 
[03:11:30]  i would  beat you  with my  penis  why is  the audio  quality  why are  you standing  in front  of a  shrub  and he's  in the  white  house  how come  every time  it says  fox news  at the  bottom  of the  screen  so we  met at  a little  chalet  no that's  the wrong  word  cafe  yeah well  it was like  it was this  crazy cafe  i can't remember  the name of  but it was  like they  had  curtains  where it was  just you  in a private 
[03:12:00]  little drinking  yeah  oh nice  how long after  you met  him  real quick  how long  after you  met him  did you  go out  with him  um  i don't  know  like a  couple weeks  later  okay so  in that  time though  was there  any sort  of sexual  build like  did you get  any hints  before that  like was  he texting  you like  i can't  wait to  see you  you're so  gorgeous  like anything  that made  you think  yeah this  guy might  be a little  fucking  no no  nothing at  all  nothing  all right  okay  he didn't  say oh  nothing indicative  okay  no and  and then so  we met  there and  he was like  freaking out 
[03:12:30]  over he was  very complimentary  because at the  apple store like  i didn't have  any makeup on  and like i  was i was  kind of  flattered to  be hit on  because i  like looked  kind of  schlubby and  then i was  like to the  nines  you were white  a little  and uh  so uh  and then he  said um  and he ordered  like almost  nothing to eat  um and then  we drank like  a bottle of  wine and so  i was like  kind of  hammered  you know  oh boy  but he said  to me he  said he  said um 
[03:13:00]  so i would  say you are  a woman who  is a  passionate  with excellent  taste and  who enjoys  adventure  and i was  like  who wasn't  going to  say yes  to that  exactly  i know  and i was  like  talking to  you like  jacquist  the guy  from serpent  in the rainbow  talked to you  with a fucking  and he had a  little ascot  oh yeah  oh christ  well that sounds  like something  liberaci said  i feel like i  failed you  if you have a  little ascot  so yeah 
[03:13:30]  so then he  um uh  so then we  went for a  walk um  into central  park and he  was going on  and on about  john lennon  whatever and  then he did  the immediate  hand holding  which is like  that's a warning  sign because  any guy who's  doing that is  like aggressively  like moving  forward on  some kind of  a strategy  you know  don't you agree  i you know  i only like  had someone  hold hands  with me  once or  twice  oh man  oh jesus 
[03:14:00]  talk to  when you  got dicks  in both  of them  can you let  go of that  cock so i  could be  romantic  please  i was in  two long-term  relationships  i'm just  starting to  date now  yeah  and like  so if  if people  like hold  my hands  i think it  would be a  little like  kind of  weird  really  yeah  are you  more comfortable  like if i  were to like  tweak your  nipple right  now would  you be more  comfortable with  that than 
[03:14:30]  to hold your  hands  yes  yeah  okay  sure i  always do  that when  i'm at  strip clubs  women are  allowed to  yeah yeah  to touch  yeah  guys of  course  because i'm  like because  most of them  are like bi  are you bi  yes  yeah see  yeah  there you go  nice  i didn't want  to tweak the  nipple i  thought that  would be  inappropriate  what  if you want  to tweak  the nipple  i feel we've  known each  other long  enough you  can tweak  the nipple  all right  look at that  i don't give  a fuck 
[03:15:00]  oh chip  chip  what do you  think chip  no that's  no that's not  it feels like  the end of a  small toe or  something  nice  are you saying  that i have  callous nipples  no it's just  plump like a  baby toe  feels good  little baby  toes  i can't even  describe how  he's grabbing  it  it's like  very repetitive  he looks like  he's trying to  pull a ticket  out of a  machine  yeah  stuck  like out of  a skee-ball  machine  yeah  that or how  you'd fucking  when you used to 
[03:15:30]  buy cigarettes out of  the old cigarette  machines and it  wouldn't come out  have you ever had  someone fumble  really bad  on your body  like that  like not  know what they  were doing  yeah  oh yes  oh yes  in porn  like i used to  have a hood ring  and my nipples  pierced  after a few weeks  i'm like  you guys just  don't know  what you're doing  we're taking  these out now  i'm like  oh really  no  oh you had a  clit hood ring  i used to  yeah  i mean i can  still put it  in but  do you have  a hole  like  is there  a hole  there  jesus 
[03:16:00]  it's really  small  did that  hurt like  hell  when you  got it  nipples  hurt far  more than  the hood  the hood  only hurt  for a second  and you're like  ooh  so does that  give you  having the  nipple rings  does that give  you heightened  sensation during  sex  is it like a  permanent nipple  clamp  um well  when i had them  they didn't really  do much  like it actually  like lessened the  feeling but now  their scar tissue  it actually makes  it better than  it was before  because now  they're more  sensitive  so  oh man  good talk  i'm trying to  look up your 
[03:16:30]  clip on the  internet here  i want to see  it with the  ring in it  jimmy's looking  up my  piercing  oh mine  i don't know  where you're  gonna find that  because it was  only my first  couple weeks  like  yeah  and you know  what i wore  i put it in  one time for  rocko reed  um because he  really likes  clit rings  so  better rocko  than robert  yes  so  i know  there's a scene  in it there  have you ever  seen  have you ever  seen the  documentary  after porn  ends  yeah 
[03:17:00]  it's great  like after porn  yeah i saw that  it's really good  it is really good  i loved it  the randy west  story made me  kind of sad  why  was he the dude  who died of the  stroke or something  no he didn't die  he was just the only  one in the documentary  like everybody  that they highlighted  had like  was just like  either like  yeah i did it  and i'm cool with it  and now this is my  life  or i did it  and i'm ashamed  of it  but now this is my  life  everybody kind of  had their cathartic  journey that they  went on  randy west was the  only guy that i  he didn't buy it  when he was like  you know man 
[03:17:30]  never got married  just hey fuck it  some guys just  keep the party  going  and it was like  yeah  he doesn't seem  like he has a bad  life i just  i just was like  that guy hung on  to it too long  and now he can't  get out of it  and like he doesn't  do porn anymore  he's just that dude  well randy  i'm sorry  randy west did a  series i think  called up and  comers  yeah  um and he had  like some of the  first footage of  jenna jameson  he had the first  he launched her  yeah yeah  yeah  and uh who was  at the time  god she was  gorgeous  she was beautiful  i mean she still

[03:20:30]  all cock he's gotta be  vegan with big hands  all cock he's got  people ever put like  tofu in your vagina or  anything just to like  support your lifestyle  choice i've never even  thought about that but  no you should try it  what are you putting  it's over sorry sorry i  just was trying to  discreetly point sorry  that's okay i didn't  think everybody's gonna  look i was just trying  to point you're  playing the biggest  murder trial in the  country sorry go ahead  i was just trying to  discreetly have you  have porn stars been 
[03:21:00]  following the zimmerman  trial i don't know i  guess not hmm yeah  i think lexie's very  sexy yeah thank you  yeah very much so  and i would be very uh  do you and you had a  clit piercing you a big  or small clit i'm asking  for a reason i have a  big clit oh i'm  sicilian i have a big  juicy clit jesus  jesus all right now  we're talking now we're  talking norton's language  do you get really wet  oh yeah i i squirt i get  really wet oh that's what  i was gonna ask you  because it says lexi  loves squirt and it's a 
[03:21:30]  little shot glass yeah  where you can drink her  squirt i guess i i don't  know but uh so big clit  nice so what does it take  to uh it doesn't take  much where you get in  there a little rattling  around and shit comes  flying out right  jesus  stop talking  yeah i was gonna say  that was really hot  don't be so technical  who's not drinking  off right now  because i was watching  a few of those on  talking about it like  it's a motor  yeah  what  like car talking  yeah yeah  gotta prime it 
[03:22:00]  you got no gas in  yeah  can you please have a  cigarette hanging off  of your lips the next  time you say that  sentence  or a shotgun  i don't believe in  i don't believe in  squirting i think it's  pee  yeah i was thinking  that too i'm like i  watch i watch i watch  a lot of the videos of  squirting and i was  watching i'm like i  gotta figure out what  this is sometimes yeah  it looks like it's just  coming out like pee  i mean have you ever  collected the squirt and  then collected your pee  and then like a taste 
[03:22:30]  test comparison  i am right  well i know that well i  haven't tasted my pee  but i have tasted my own  squirt and it tastes it's  like kind of sweet  yep  it's like kettle corn it  smells like kettle corn it's  kind of sweet and salty  she's at let me tell you  that's amazing i've had  girls squirt in my mouth  never on my dick  so maybe that'll be a  new thing like squirting  flavored kettle  wow  no but i'm telling you  it's not piss and piss  does taste like  popcorn i i don't know  about squirt like  kettle corn piss tastes  like popcorn uh that's  a great comparison 
[03:23:00]  kettle corn because i've  said three years people  ask me what if piss  tastes like  you know it's  fucking shit tastes  like cotton candy  it's amazing  just amazing  no one would think  but no but i don't  i guess that's a great  way to look at it  no i've said for years  piss tastes like  popcorn yeah yeah  squirt's definitely not  pissed because i've never  seen it would be yellow  once in a while at least  and i've never seen  yellow  well i'm just gonna  i'm gonna maintain that  until i can actually do it  so scientific  i think it's just it's  just like some guys got a  big fucking load and  some guys it dribbles out 
[03:23:30]  i think it's just you know  people people just uh  shoot differently  whatever that is  whatever that lube is  in a girl  that uh comes flying  out in some girls  lube you still say  you're talking about  cars  lube when you're  lubing her up  you know when you're  checking the old  brake pads  what uh but what are  you saying if whatever  the lube is  like you know the  self-lubricating uh  vagina there  you got one of those  self-lubricating vagina  whatever that fluid is  vagina there  you know  you sound like  you're one cylinder 
[03:24:00]  and uh yeah so  whatever that is  i guess in a girl  like a squirt  i think it's called  pussy juice  pussy juice  right the pussy juice  glands whatever forms  the pussy juice  it's probably just like  insane in girls that  squirt so it just  it's flying out  yeah  maybe  yeah  and so does that  feel better than  just like a regular  you know classic  orgasm  it's more intense  the videos are crazy  they're like  they're shaking  and arching  and fucking  it's flying out  you know what  i've been with 
[03:24:30]  two i think two  girls in my  in my past  that have squirted  at the same time  they no  no but they get  very both of them  got extremely  self-conscious about  it yep  um one of them  the first time we  had sex it was  really wet everywhere  and i was like  and i just was like  man you woke up  you're holding a  knife  it was like 
[03:25:00]  barton fink  i didn't kill that  girl i swear to god  but the first time  we had sex  we had sex  in the night  and in the morning  and the first time  at night  we were both drunk  and i remember  saying like man  you're really wet  and i wasn't being  insulting or prerogative  who would take  that as insulting  well she got  really weird about  it and i go  i go no no no  i like it  i go why are you  so and she's  like no no no  and then the next  morning we were  back we were  fucking around again  and then we  started having sex  and she was like  you gotta stop 
[03:25:30]  you gotta stop  you gotta stop  and i was like  what  and she's like  just please  please  and i was like  and then i was  like are you a  squirter  and she was like  shut up  shut up  and she like  covered her face  she got so  and the other girl  acted like that too  you point at her  and go ha ha  yeah get out of here  you make me sick  exactly  disgusting  yeah  clown flower pussy  aha  clown flower pussy  you squirter  so am i  and then you come  and offend  hey  you should support 
[03:26:00]  her and do like  a um  it gets better  psa  oh yeah  on squirting  well why  my question was  going to be  why  you're obviously  not embarrassed  but why do girls  get self-conscious  about that  how do you know  i'm not embarrassed  oh man  you you're embarrassed  are you embarrassed  i'm sorry  i've been embarrassed  before  oh you have  yeah like um  i was having sex  with somebody  and they didn't  i figure everybody  knows i'm a squirter  that like if i'm  having sex with them  i'm sure they've  like watched my porn  somewhere along the line 
[03:26:30]  and i squirted  a ton  and they like  instantly took the sheets  off and put new sheets  on and like  oh swamp bed  and i'm like  whoa  why would you do that  i'm like ouch  but i mean  they didn't need it  in a bad way  but that's what they said  and we were really drunk  cleaning up from like  a murder scene  i would grab the back  of your head  and put your nose in it  and hit you with a newspaper  no no no  what did you do  what did you do  i would just hand you  a toaster  so do you like that 
[03:27:00]  that a guy has done  like like  due diligence on you  before fucking you  like that would kind of  freak me out  like um  you know if it's already  happened like if you  meet me  and then you go and  watch me  then i get a little  like come on  like you're getting  the real thing  why you gotta go  and watch the porn  now if you've already  seen me  well i can't help  the fact that we  didn't meet before  you watched my porn  so that doesn't  bother me  right  you know  but like watching it  like while you're  getting it  like it's just  kind of weird 
[03:27:30]  oh so people want  to watch your porn  while they're fucking  you  that would be  great right  that would be  funny  that would be  funny  but that would be  funny  i have to find  one of those  micro penises  if you have one  of those in a movie  imagine watching  there's just some  guy railing it  with a giant dick  and you're like  you bet i can  imagine  you bet i can  jimmy's loving  the idea  oh boy  that his was  better than the  feel  i bet you  the people who  really like  humiliation  would probably  be into that

[03:32:30]  or something i should probably  know that uh look for me on  twitter anthony cumia on  twitter and i'll let you know  we'll just go to a justice for  trayvon and the one voice that  doesn't make sense it's his  twitter have a good weekend  the open anthony show continues in a  reanimated sort of way  after oana live with sam roberts  next  this is after oana live here's your 
[03:33:00]  host sam roberts  here we go  with the after show  after opie and anthony live  fun show today fun show joe de rosa  just took off  i thought joe said next time he was in  he's gonna do the after show didn't he  say that on the phone yesterday 
[03:33:30]  yeah i think he's just saying hi to  somebody  well i don't know he said goodbye to  me a minute ago  i'll go get him  what a piece of garbage  that's not cool  right didn't he said that so why  wouldn't i expect him to  eric expected him to stay too eric  said he was staying  what a piece of garbage  real piece of work that joe de rosa is  i hope eric goes and tells him right  now in the hallway sam is on the air  calling you a piece of garbage  i'm only kidding it'll ruin his day 
[03:34:00]  eric's already gone he'll miss that  part  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number to  call  and opie wasn't in today  so we don't have any sudoku puzzles  to give away you know opie always  does the sudoku while the show's on  we don't play any music he does the  sudoku puzzle while he's doing the  show itself  but he's not in today so obviously  there's no sudoku puzzles  so the interns gave me their book  reports 
[03:34:30]  and they signed them  they're still coming back  joe you said you were gonna stay  next time  remember yesterday you said next time  i'm on the show i want to stay for  the after show  yeah i know i didn't know i was  gonna have to  i'm staying i didn't know i was  gonna have to drive two and a half  hours  just saying it's a real shitty move  to then come the next day  it was because i didn't expect the  next time to be a four hour  round trip  excuses  all right look i'm here  i'm here despite that i'm gonna  fall over in a second i'm so tired 
[03:35:00]  is this my god to say that joe just  to say that pete dominic came in just  to say that in case is this my god  to say that you bet it is i just  came in sam i'm so sorry to  interrupt  no pete dominic let me tell you  something  what you're always welcome on the  after i appreciate that sam  it's pete dominic from uh indie  i mean as you know i'm a huge fan  of yours and i listen all the  time my drive home uh when i come  in but i just came in to set joe up  because i feel like your audience  probably knows how great of a  comedian he is but joe's always  been a great comedian very widely  respected by by uh obviously all 
[03:35:30]  comedians i'm not gonna let you  down  thanks  wow  he's looking at me like i'm about  to punch him  i just came in i'm leaving i'm  walking out  yeah i'm gonna stay here and hog  airtime  i just came in to say i love joe uh  i think he's a great comedian and a  great guy  and uh and that's it i think he's  really funny if anybody doesn't see  him live they should  joe this you're not used to this in  this studio  not in this room  let me return the compliment  uh what is this a blowjob festival  pete dominic stand up with pete  dominic mornings uh here  he's competing with us you can't 
[03:36:00]  plug his show  oh shit sorry i'm sorry  what are you doing  i didn't realize i'm sorry  just because he comes in and blows  you doesn't mean you go and run  off with the competition we're  gonna press it and steve you  never let you back on again  um all right pete's very good on  cnn when he's on in the afternoons  and you know what  very funny guy  his show replays until like noon  so after this show  you can tune into the rerun  catch like the last hour of his  rerun  i forget that up here you guys are  actually competing with each other 
[03:36:30]  because everybody's in the same  like under the same banner  so i always forget that  i mean i don't see how we are  really competing with each other  because nobody's got any  ratings like it's not like  anybody knows who's listening  to what as long as people are  subscribing to the platform it  doesn't matter that's why  that's why there's so many  shows take the money and run  yeah exactly give me this much  and i'm out of here that's why  there's so many horrible shows on  the platform because to do a  good show you actually have to  just want to do one there's no  ratings numbers that say oh i 
[03:37:00]  gotta increase this quarter hour  and really step it up here and  there's no motivation for it  unless you're personally  motivated person someone like  sam roberts you understand  you know people talk to me  about sam roberts  they do  is that right  they will they say what kind  of man is he  really what do you what do you  say one beyond description  yeah yeah  you can't comprehend  the type of man this guy is  what's been going on with you  and roland on social media  i don't know he's always  picking at me  i don't fucking know  he started it i don't know 
[03:37:30]  he's always picking at you  until you acknowledge it and  then he panics and deletes it  uh is he here  yeah he said because what he  did yesterday  but i didn't but all i wrote  in  i don't know why he panicked  yesterday he did this vine  that said i suck or something  like that  that's exactly what it said  yeah and then uh and then  i couldn't i didn't have sound  on my phone  like for i swear to god it was  weird that was the only vine on  his feed that wouldn't play  sound 
[03:38:00]  so i just wrote under it  roland the video won't play  sound on my phone i can only  assume you're saying  something very nice about  me and my character that's  all i wrote that's nice  obviously being i was being  smarmy i was joking sure but  i don't know why that would  cause you to panic and  delete it i was like not  upset about it yesterday  because i'll tell you what  happened yesterday somebody  while you were on the phone  somebody was on the other  line saying i just want to  tell de rosa to never make  vine videos and i said i'm  not here to take negative  joe de rosa phone calls  right so i didn't take the 
[03:38:30]  phone call  i'll just repeat it on the air  the next day when i'm sitting  here we need it for the  context we need it you know  yeah yeah of course not for  the art for the art of the  show exactly i got you i'm  with you sam and so i told  roland and sal that there  was a somebody had said  that and roland said oh i've  never seen his vines yes and  so he goes on your twitter  account and he starts looking  at your vines and you have  like the joe de rosa thought  of the day and you have joe  de rosa you know uh feeling  fulfilled with yourself but  also self-doubting at the  same time yeah you know and  he was looking at them roland  was unimpressed well 
[03:39:00]  here's the thing though  this is what i was trying  to tell in the hallway right  they're not supposed to be  impressive right the thought  of the day things were just  a thing where i was like oh  this will make me post a vine  every day in between when i  actually have like a good vine  idea for like a creative  little thing because my thing  with twitter is if i can't  think of a i don't care enough  about any of this stuff to put  a lot of thought into it so  unless something hits me  across the face i won't do it  so with vine you're like i  need quantity not quality 
[03:39:30]  yeah and well vine and  twitter i actually have a  decent amount of followers  like like vine i don't i  don't have a ton but i have  like like going up towards  four thousand which is being  new to vine like that's not  bad so like i got that i just  try to well you also have a  radio show every day you have  a vehicle joe is just i'm out  there on my own you do have  to like the thing awful though  for the worst lines for  comedians especially if you  don't have an already  established audience from  years yeah you don't have 
[03:40:00]  any choice but to be active  on social media really you  have to just keep doing it  and like there's no way to  there's no way to do like  from at least in my head  like a daily instagram thing  like my brain doesn't work  that way i don't see enough  in a day where i go oh  what nice picture dude but  instagram yeah but now you do  your vines on instagram yeah  i just killed two birds and  i only used one stone to do  it more people i think that  was a little bit of a  disrespecting them a little 
[03:40:30]  bit instagram that was a  little bit of a shitty move  on instagram's part oh  killed them they were like  oh vine you've got a good  idea we'll just take that  and yeah and add some  seconds to it and some  little effects yeah the  effects was the real fuck  you yeah and then they have  150 million subscribers and  vine has i don't like i'm  not gonna you're not gonna  catch me on vine but  here's the thing twitter  owns vine twitter vine is  twitter's thing so twitter's  already like really guys all  you got is pictures right  we got we got both of this  these things fucking come on 
[03:41:00]  yeah but now instagram's got  saying we got text which you  have twitter now we have  photo and video it's all  instagram um and it's easier  control on instagram it's it's  it's all about instagram  look i picked your cover photo  on instagram the most important  thing here is that roland saw  your vines and he didn't like  them unimpressed i don't i  don't have a problem with  he said these are not good  vines yeah and mine are  awful i did roland has the  worst vines on the entire  internet yeah until joe came  around he just picks up his  phone and he'll go like trying 
[03:41:30]  to catch the subway and the  vine would just be him going  down the stairs but the phone's  not pointed to his face the  phone's not pointed to his feet  you just see the stairs because  it infuriates people or or in  train he's bad with timing so  he'll see something that's  exciting and he'll go homeless  person on the street and he'll  start recording his little vine  and he'll run up to the person  but it'll take six seconds just  to run up to the person and  that's and then he posts it 
[03:42:00]  there's nothing going on on  these vines it is it is with as  far as the timing thing goes i  don't really blame you for not  trying to like the thing that's  so annoying about it yeah it's  fucking social media it's it's  it's essentially brainless  pointless stuff it's fodder it's  bullshit and when it starts to  get into this place of like no i  have to do it until it's right and  then i will post it it's just like  fuck this like i hate the idea of my 
[03:42:30]  life like that of like looking at a  tweet after you write it and trying  to punch it up or fix the wording or  whatever it's like i've done that i'm  not better than doing that of course  hate myself when i do it yeah but  that's also because if you misspell  one word you're crucified i i if i  misspell word i i trash the tweet and  repost it with the word spelled  correctly i won't let it go with a  misspelled word you have to and then  and then there's always the one  asshole who's like i saw it before you  corrected it thanks thank you yeah it's  just it's but roland was the asshole  yesterday because he decided his new 
[03:43:00]  thing on vine would be to uh critique  your vines and he just posted a vine  that said that you suck yeah not him  it's just his vines oh yeah i said joe  doesn't suck his vines suck no you  specifically said joe de rosa's vines  suck you didn't say joe doesn't suck  you suck yeah that's true that's true  i see your vines suck no no no no you  didn't he said your your end quote of  that video was you suck now we know why  he took it down yes so he could change  what it was he loves spinning he loves 
[03:43:30]  to spin home on it now and then he went  on instagram where you can get 15  seconds and he went on and he talked  about your vines and i believe you said  you weren't funny jesus yeah here i have  it right here you have the original yeah  or the one you did today the original  okay  your vines really do holy god they smell  worse than my ass oh you sir okay  your vines do it's a lead jerk fucking 
[03:44:00]  account god he did okay he goes you  suck your vines do yeah i didn't say they  smell worse than my cat hole my asshole  that was that's asshole uh listen and  then he goes home last night and he  panics and deletes both the videos i don't  know why it's this panic thing and then  he's tweeting me and he goes he goes you  don't understand uh you know you guys  have a little more carte blanche i'm uh the  talent booker so i have to and i'm like  in my head i'm going okay roland i'm 
[03:44:30]  done with the conversation but in my  head i'm going joe de rosa doesn't do  o and a because roland spins some we  he does o and a because he's friends  with o and he's friends with a yeah like  it's not jimmy too and jim too it  doesn't matter who the booker is but  yeah well now here's the thing it's it's  uh i consider all you guys pals at this  point but uh no you couldn't because  you didn't have my phone number you  rock told me that you needed my eye you  know you call me before you didn't have  my phone because i get your number  every time like that for me rock and  then i forget to save it every time i  call you i have to go into the text 
[03:45:00]  thread and then and then i get a new  phone and i lose your number it's  happened like four fucking that's why  that's why i don't think that you  consider me a pal because number one  you wanted to leave today and you said  you were going to stay number two you  don't even keep my phone number and i  got to get back into a fucking  interview in philly after this who  are you doing an interview with there's  a guy that writes for a paper in philly  who's also a horror writer and he's  writing a horror novel something i  don't i can't probably shouldn't say  what it is but he's he needs he wants  to interview me wants me to be a 
[03:45:30]  person he interviews for this thing  and i love horror so i want to talk to  him uh but i i i gotta get back before  three o'clock so you're sitting there  going like oh i'm so exhausted and  ahead of me today is one i have to  drive for two hours and then i have to  talk about scary movies for a bit no no  i gotta get back before the cutoff time  and i'm scared i'm gonna hit traffic the  jersey turnpike is a fucking fiasco  did you tell joe about your buddy and  him have the same problem in philly  with preston is a presence i don't have  a problem with them they won't let you  back on the show look you'll be your  buddy too this is all i'll say and i 
[03:46:00]  don't i know you had mentioned yesterday  there's history or whatever which i am  obviously not a part of so i don't have  an opinion on it uh i've been doing this  show for a very long time and i've had  a great time on this show and i continue  to and i did their show a very few  times but i had fun every time i did it  and we seemed to get along and they  they would say things to me that i  thought meant they knew me from this  show like oh there's that high-pitched  laugh we love that and it's like it's 
[03:46:30]  like oh they opie always says that to me  like so they must know me from the show  and they're fucking like well what a  asshole we know him from our show i  don't know look nothing was said to me  nothing was confirmed i just know that  the last few times i've been there they  have passed on have on my request on the  request of me going in so i i can i'm  only assuming it's probably got something  to do with that which you know look i i  hate to somehow you know get i don't  know be a product of something that's 
[03:47:00]  going on between people i'm not even you  know it's like i wasn't involved in that  situation and i don't even know if that's  what it is maybe they just think i stink  now that could be like me that's like  your vines  maybe the last time i was in they were  just like hey you know joe's whatever  have you checked precedent steve's vines  do they have anything that says you  suck  because that could be it no but i bet  there's a lot with hooters girls on  there and they love hooters girls i think  i think they might have a pension for  hooters girls what is it 1988 it's  every hooters girls almost every morning 
[03:47:30]  radio show like terrestrial morning  radio show has a thing with the hooters  girls what is it those nude tights that  they wear under their shorts i think it's  a c-section hooters girls you don't  sam i travel this great nation of  ours yeah tell me my good good work  yeah and uh and i've done a lot of  morning radio there's a lot of and i'm  not even making fun of this it's just  there's a lot of terrestrial radio  stations where like you go in and  there's something going on with the  hooters girls  there's always you know what i gotta 
[03:48:00]  tell you something charity thing when i  was working for scorch in syracuse we  almost never did any bits it was  miserable but the one time we did a  bit it was trivia you know what kind of  trivia it was hooters girls girls  trivia we brought in the trivia i don't  know oh you bring them in there i  thought you meant it was trivia about  hooters girls who was the seventh i  couldn't even do trivia about hooters  yeah i hate that fucking place i i don't  mind hooters i think it's a little like  stupid i like going there's a goof i 
[03:48:30]  think it's the worst some of the worst  food i've ever had yeah it's not good  it's like a step down from applebee's  uh it's like the it's the whole concept  of it is so dumb like hey yeah yeah a  couple of days i'm cleaning you guys  yeah yeah it's right go to a strip club  you fucking pussy we're adults you know  what are we doing here yeah it's just so  stupid i hate that words the food's  awful but yeah the wings are the worst  wings i've ever had it tastes like a  ball of grease it does there's no  flavor it tastes like all grease and then  that pathetic come yeah they like 
[03:49:00]  sprinkle hot sauce on it then it's  literally just like frank's red hot  there's nothing to this oh that place  sucks and it was syracuse so these  girls didn't come in in their hooters  outfits they were wearing like sweaters  i was like what's the point guys we  have brains who cares yeah yeah yeah  no i thought we were here to do trivia  you know i thought we were just here to  answer some questions wearing a sweater  doesn't mean you're smart shut up let me  go to uh selena in texas what's up 
[03:49:30]  selena okay i'm a long-time listener i  love you sam thank you very much but i  was listening to roland's food court last  week i think and he made fun of a guy  that called in and he really is a country  singer and i felt kind of bad that he  was like all being really rude to him  oh well roland i remember that i know  you're talking about selena roland wasn't  rude to him but his guests were no no i i i was  trying to talk to him and it was the other  guy josh was getting bad so i said i  didn't want it to get any worse so i cut 
[03:50:00]  it off he's getting bad he says what was  the country singer's name i'm brett  eldridge no i love his music i love him  as a person i mean brett eldridge was his  name yeah it's roland had the cuban and  some food critic on i don't remember his  name josh the other the other guest was  getting nasty towards him so did you get  any feedback from that interview uh i  explained to the the the rep like it  wasn't me i just i i thought it was  gonna get worse because i saw him being  like an ass so i'm like i'm just gonna  end it right away before it gets any 
[03:50:30]  worse so it's fine so yeah i didn't do  anything to it you went on the internet  again today this morning already rolling  yes rolandos 99 on twitter and uh you've  made another vine after you deleted the  first two videos oh boy eric just pulled  up a hooters girl thing from the opn  anthony show yeah when they were on wnaw yeah  this is uh i was gonna give the benefit  of a doubt and hopefully it was 98 but  it's 2000 and they had the hooters girls  and did opie and anthony i'm telling you 
[03:51:00]  it's got to be something with the stations  themselves and the hooters restaurant  time it's got to be some like agreement  where they're like listen you got to  bring the girls it's got to be yeah it  is it is i'm fucking canny dude every  morning show on terrestrial radio they  love hooters girls it's like it's  crazy it's not crazy it's just it's  just weird it can't be a coincidence  it doesn't make any sense it's never  sorry i jumped in on roland's story no  roland now today after deleting the  first two joe de rosa sucks videos he  made another one this morning and he 
[03:51:30]  posted it you man and then troy yelled  at him for taking it down dude troy he  wouldn't let it go troy has been all  over roland's ass even last night to  putting him down even last night he  wouldn't stop which that upset because  i thought maybe troy doesn't like me  well i think troy well maybe he  doesn't he probably does it but i just  had a very nice conversation that's the  first time we've had a conversation  since our since our makeup you yeah you  made it there you blow up you and troy  big fight on the air old stuff and then  you went to caroline's christmas party 
[03:52:00]  and you pulled troy aside and we hugged  in the corner and you begged for  forgiveness and you said troy i can't  handle you you're too much man for me  all right and then you made up yeah  don't make it sound like the scene in  fucking uh miller's crossing like i'm  to toro in the forest yeah so we did we  did meet we did make up but we still  hadn't had a conversation till today was  the first time we actually had a  conversation and now you guys are going  t-shirt shopping together that's great  right there was always a little bit of a 
[03:52:30]  kinship i thought so they're both  wearing like black v-neck shirts although  troy's isn't quite a v-neck it's more of  just like a deep crew neck troy's also  has some structure behind it right yeah  mine looks like you draped and fucking  uh black cloth over dough and troy has  these like now sleeves of brightly  colored tattoos and uh joe de rosa not  that i'm anyone to talk about bad  tattoos but you're kind of because you're  new to the game you're some weird  placement it kind of looks like they're  also healing and they look like right  now little kid stick on supermarket 
[03:53:00]  tattoos at the moment yeah they still got  that new yeah scab yeah to them what is  that again troy oh it's i got these are  all like old skateboard graphics this is  santa cruz it's a blue hand with a mouth  in it that was on the bottom of the  board right yeah i remember that from  when i was a kid mark gonzalez he was an  old skater roland troy was giving you a  hard time about taking down the de rosa  videos yes yes yes i mean i have to  because there's something with roland if  you say you do something roland will bust  your fucking balls forever forever forever  forever and he and he will walk up and 
[03:53:30]  down this hallway he will let everybody  know what you did he will goof on you on  twitter he'll make instagram videos for  you that's true roland i mean the one  time you find out a monocle is that a  unit of measurement a monocle a monocle  no we don't go up and down the hall  monocle is a thing you wear in your eye  like mr peanut people to come in the  office and you tell them you go up and  down the halls and tell literally every  person that works here anytime you find  out something about somebody yeah you  two go in the office you're calling people  but we also stand by what we say we  don't pussy out of shit you're saying 
[03:54:00]  that's what roland i told him that i've  told that to his face did i not say that to  you and no and roland you know i love  you but that's that's some pussy shit  here's here's here's what i don't get  this is why i'm so shocked that that  you got nervous about the vine thing  that is so beneath the meanest social  media thing you've ever done to me  when i i was on the road i was in a  bad way i got really mad at fred from  brooklyn i was talking earlier and we  were going at it on twitter and then i  got mad at iraq right i was just i was 
[03:54:30]  in mississippi and then you called iraq in  the office yeah and then we and then iraq  put you on speakerphone and then i played  crybaby by janice joplin and then roland  hung up on me fucking steam coming out of  my ears but again in my defense i was in  mississippi i was two weeks into driving  everything it was and you're a sensitive  guy joe and i am sensitive you're a really  sensitive guy sam yeah you're starting  with a sensitive foundation and then you  piled out anyway he fucking took the 
[03:55:00]  fred from brooklyn tweet that i got mad  about yeah and started sending it to all  the biggest names and serious that you  could think of going please retweet this  okay that's so much meaner than the vine  thing okay because the fred if i remember  the big fred from brooklyn tweet which  by the way you and fred are even on good  terms now it's fine terms it's fine i  just got a little sensitive and it was  during the uh yeah joe mckellery tweeted  it was during the boston terrorist attack  thing that the the marathon and uh i believe 
[03:55:30]  fred's quote was something i'm paraphrasing  to the effect of uh nobody has bombed that  badly in boston since joe de rosa did his  last special it wasn't no no that's not  what it was it said nobody bombed and  bombed and left and got out and got out  so quickly since joe de rosa so quickly okay  and uh and it's and and here's the thing  and that was a joke by the way yeah it's a  fine joke listen it's right  it's like i even retweeted and then joe  called eric and he was very upset and  he's going to wrote haha right eric 
[03:56:00]  replied haha and joe's like joe called  him and he goes dude i don't need that  right now i'm trying to i got a special  coming out i don't need people thinking  i'm a bad comedian and eric's like what  the fuck are you calling me and nobody  thought look just can i say two things  the only reason i called eric was  because i was like i don't want to talk  about this on twitter can we just call  you and just and i didn't call him to  give him shit i was like dude eric this  is where i was coming from man all right  it's not a big deal sorry but i will say  this because i want to put this my last 
[03:56:30]  year i feel like today was a rebirth okay  i've been on the show in a little while  yeah you know whatever i've been  traveling stuff today was my first day  back in a while and i felt like today  was a rebirth because i passed a year  anniversary mark okay last year was a  very tumultuous turmoil filled year for  me my mom was sick yeah i was way hope  you feel good about yourself by the way  no no no no no i was way fucking 
[03:57:00]  sensitive last year i the day i started  the shit with you was like i was driving  up from pennsylvania i would stay with my  mom i was you were fucking with him  while his mom was you know that real  nice troy you have to be first you but  you fuck with his livelihood do not buy  into what he's doing real nice i'm saying  to you the day i fucked with you i was  doing that the day i fucked with dr steve  was in that period the day that's right i  forgot you got when i was on tour when i  was on this tour and i got mad at fred and  eroc that was like i was in the process of 
[03:57:30]  moving out of the apartment i was miserable  in at the tail end of this year of going  through the shit i was in a very sensitive  place sure i am happy to finally be back  on my normal course of life you feel like  to be back here doing the show again i i i  really feel like i was a little out of  sorts a few times this last year did you  realize that during the last year  everybody here was taking specific joy  and fucking with you when we did because  we knew for whatever reason you were  being very butthurt at that time because 
[03:58:00]  i realized that now at the time i was  like but i was being like super  sensitive i was lashing out and then i  kind of realized the other day i was  like why was i doing that i was like  jesus and i started kind of doing all  the math because of all the stressors  and it was just like every little thing  and it's like i'm in this new apartment  now in brooklyn i'm fucking loving it  blah blah blah it's just like oh i feel  like normal again so things are starting  over troy do you think roland needs to  start over you think roland's on some  pussy shit right now i just think if 
[03:58:30]  roland says something he just needs to  stick with it and not backpedal and  pussy out of it i get that roland i mean  that's just it's just like my job he  leaks into my real life so but why is it  part of your job either don't say it  i have a lot of opinions about a lot of  people and i just keep them to myself i  don't bring them not always no but if i  do say if i say it out loud sam we're  not adding those flames if i say it out  loud do i not back it up sometimes i  mean not if i go on a social media site  and i say this person sucks am i gonna 
[03:59:00]  fucking delete it you delete it but you  backpedal something okay tell give me an  example  okay i don't think there is one here's  the thing i don't think there is one  here's the difference  yet a bad point here's the difference  here's the difference and now you like  them when did it when it first of all  when have i said that i like joe  what now i mean joe's fine we're fine  you see what happened here and now you  gotta you gotta get to the root of it  listen i don't want to be in the middle of this  debate between you guys i need everybody's public  statements troy just for the record 
[03:59:30]  you're not getting you're not ready to  go out and say i like joe de rosa  joe de rosa is fine but you can't say  you like him he's fine and i don't know  i don't know him will you say that you  like no i don't know joe all right so  we get where that is really ruined well  we're on our way to a friendship and i  ruined it here's the thing though i think  i honestly think what what troy is saying  here's the difference between what you're  saying and what roland's doing troy is  saying i will go online 
[04:00:00]  if i am so whatever uh inclined to do  there you go uh and say this guy sucks  fuck him and if i say it i mean it i mean  what i say and i'm gonna stand by it the  difference is is we're pals and you're  trying to fuck with me a little bit in a  funny way and i think you got nervous like  oh my god i'm i'm i'm up i'm worried my  friend might not realize i'm just joking  around he might get mad at me because he  he's trying to taking the easy way out  he's taking the easy way out i am 
[04:00:30]  pussy shit you are pussy shit yes but that's not pussy  shit there's a difference between but that's what i have to tell every time i say it  just just stay keep up and be like dude joe i'm fucking busting your balls on twitter relax  like if there was a problem there wasn't even a problem there wasn't even a problem because i am  pussy shit but see what happens is you are a little bit yes but here's the thing you don't stand by  what you say he took it down after i had already seen it and commented on it what were you taking  it down at that point because here's what happens he gets wound up from everybody in the office  and everybody's like yeah roland do it and roland's like fuck yeah and then he posted he gets he does 
[04:01:00]  it and then he goes home and he's sitting home alone going oh why did i say that oh i wish they  wouldn't have done that and then he gets scared about it roland this is a very dangerous place  it is it's a sewer system they get you to say and do things you don't really mean this place is a  whole system of sewers you get caught up you know i handle that president steve thing very diplomatically  i don't know why they won't have me on i think it's not my business your association with opian anthony  i think well um we can all we can all think things we can assume but oh sam you would have loved it 
[04:01:30]  if i went let me fucking tell you i wouldn't i don't want that i don't want that i want that either  i want peace i want peace but i would also like to get to the bottom of things you want peace  like the way the emperor in star wars says he wants peace you want to slaughter you want to  see genocide happening but then you go i want peace but i want peace that's the goal that's the end  goal of all the genocide right yeah right yeah yeah we'll get there but we got to get to the bottom  of things you know what's the bottom the bottom is hey folks i love it and so you wanted some real
