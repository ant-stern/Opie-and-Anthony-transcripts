<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Jimmy, in their characteristic crude style, joking around in the absence of Anthony, who was ill.  The initial focus shifted to the viral video of homeless man Mustard singing Radiohead's "Creep," leading to a discussion about Opie's commitment to producing a musical album with him.  The conversation then turned somber, addressing the devastating earthquake in Haiti, the potential half-million death toll, and comparisons to other large-scale tragedies like Hurricane Katrina and 9/11.  Listeners called in, offering perspectives and statistics on the disaster's scale, including a comparison to a hypothetical American tragedy of similar proportion.  A substantial portion of the show delved into the Jay Leno/Conan O'Brien late-night TV conflict, with listener calls contributing to the discussion.  The hosts also discussed the Dominican Republic's relative prosperity compared to Haiti, speculating on government corruption and historical factors, and debated the accuracy of Pat Robertsonâ€™s comments on the earthquake, referencing a Haitian legend about a pact with the devil.  A Catholic school teacher called in, offering insights into Haitian history, culture, and social issues.  A Texan caller voiced frustration over the differing public responses to American versus international disasters.  Opie briefly mentioned his upcoming stand-up show in Cleveland.  Throughout, the hosts engaged in numerous off-color jokes and banter.

The show continued with the addition of Jim Norton and guest Nick DiPaolo. This segment heavily featured further discussion of the Haitian earthquake and the media's contrasting coverage of other events, such as Texas flooding.  Mustard, the homeless singer, appeared in studio, recounting his experiences, his struggles with alcoholism (including a recent relapse), and a humorous anecdote involving Lady Gaga. The conversation frequently digressed, including discussions of Carla Homolka and the ongoing late-night TV host shuffle.  Repeated, comedically chaotic attempts to get Mustard to perform a musical number were hampered by technical difficulties and Mustard's inebriation.  DiPaolo shared a story about a purported encounter with a young Russian woman while in a towel.  The segment concluded with Mustard still attempting to perform, interspersed with jokes from the hosts about his performance and their plans for his album.

A later segment focused primarily on the NBC late-night shakeup involving Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.  DiPaolo, along with Opie and Anthony, debated the reasons behind Leno's return, considering ratings, Conan's appeal, and network politics.  They discussed scandals surrounding Letterman, contrasting his ratings with Conan's.  Clips from the comedians' monologues were played, highlighting their jokes on the situation, especially Letterman's harsh comments. A pre-recorded segment with Kenneth the Page from *30 Rock* offered sarcastic commentary.  A caller, "Cutler," voiced his opinion that Leno's shows were funnier.  The segment also featured attempts to connect with a caller named Bobo, who recounted a disastrous fraternity gig in Buffalo, providing significant comedic relief.  Efforts to get another caller, "Tank Hankress," to comment were largely unsuccessful. DiPaolo promoted his upcoming shows.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit radio.  All right.  We hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is shit radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony's shoe.  How's everybody this morning?  I actually slept. 
[00:04:30]  I don't like when you're well slept.  I don't either.  I'm all happy to be here.  All chipper?  Yeah.  Did I say chipper?  I'd say.  How about not chipper?  How about no chipper?  Something tells me he'll be making an appearance at one point.  I would imagine.  Anthony will not be attending the program today.  Poor little baby's not feeling well.  But we will.  We wish it.  We are hoping for the worst. 
[00:05:00]  Whatever it is.  Hoping it hurts.  But we will be doing a fine radio show today.  I hear Mustard's coming in at 7 o'clock.  Yes.  And I, man, I'm stuck.  He wrote me.  He said, all right, motherfucker.  When are we producing this album?  And then he goes, and by the way, I'm sober.  He's not drinking.  Good.  This whole Mustard thing has taken off.  You know the story, right?  Everyone knows the story. 
[00:05:30]  Mustard comes in for the homeless shopping spree.  That never happened.  Picks up a guitar.  Sings a version of Creep by Radiohead.  And the damn video, the original video, is up to 630,000 views.  Wow.  And then there's like somebody took the audio and made another video and tweaked with it  to make it sound a little better.  That version is doing very well.  And then someone stole the version and put it on another video site.  And that did another couple hundred thousand views. 
[00:06:00]  We're talking probably close to a million views overall for this Mustard doing Radiohead's  Creep.  And then he did a bunch of other songs, and a few of those songs are over 100,000 views.  It's unbelievable.  So I was kind enough to go, well, God, I'll produce an album.  So now he's, you know, now he's expecting it.  You're so used to saying things to homeless people that they don't remember?  Oh, of course not.  Yeah, right.  I'll buy you a hat made of gold.  Right.  And then he doesn't even remember.  I see him in the street.  He doesn't even remember that I met him. 
[00:06:30]  You're right.  And this guy shows up.  He's like, oh, no.  I was sober when you said that.  Let's get to produce it.  I'm like, I don't know the first thing about making a record.  Do you know Drew Boogie?  Yeah, exactly.  That's all.  That's about what we could offer Mustard, Drew Boogie.  No offense to Drew Boogie, but that's all I know.  Well, Drew is not a, you know.  I sure hope Mustard likes hip hop.  Do you mind having AIDS and fart sounds mixed into your song?  Into your heartbreaking melodies.  So he's sober. 
[00:07:00]  How long?  He's sober for a month.  We'll talk to him when he comes in.  I mean, that's pretty good.  Yeah, but it sounds like this really kicked him in the ass.  Because there was something about Mustard to begin with.  He's a talented guy.  And he said he got really depressed because he lost a few people in his life  and, you know, started drinking heavily.  And I don't know.  I don't think he's one of those guys that really wants to be on the streets.  Yeah.  There are guys that want to be on the street.  They don't want help.  Look what we went through with Tippi Tom.  And that guy wanted to just live on the streets when it was all said and done. 
[00:07:30]  Tippi Tom gave up.  And a lot of these guys just give up.  They're like, this is it.  This is the best I can do.  This is kind of what I deserve.  And it's amazing what you can get used to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I think I'm, like, really roughing it.  It's like, if a flight only has coach.  What a pussy I am.  What happened to me?  We think we're roughing it.  And then you see what's going on with this Haiti thing.  And you realize, oh, my God.  You said when we were coming in, you actually put the number.  Because they keep saying half a million dead.  And I don't know why that number hasn't been resonating with me. 
[00:08:00]  And then you're like, you know, it's like in New York.  It's like 3,000 people is a horrible loss.  And then you look at that.  And I'm like, oh, yeah.  That's, like, over twice as much as the tsunami.  Half a million is just 500,000 people.  That's a lot of people, man.  That's the number they're throwing around in the papers today.  That it could be up to a half million people dead from this earthquake in Haiti.  It's just heartbreaking.  I think for once I had a tough time watching the news.  Usually I could get right in there.  But some of the images just, oh, my God. 
[00:08:30]  People trapped begging for their lives.  And please help me.  I'm dying.  And there's just not enough people to help.  They just can't pull the rubble off?  Hell fucking no.  No.  Do they have equipment there?  Yeah, they're getting supplies in.  And I guess the ship's going to arrive today with the Marines and stuff to help and do whatever they can.  But this is just a complete disaster of epic proportions.  Did the whole country get fucked up or is it just Port-au-Prince?  Well, that's, like, the main place.  And that's, like, that's where they make most of their money, right? 
[00:09:00]  That's the only part of Haiti we all know.  So, unless you're from there or have relatives or whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But, yeah, I mean, it's going to hurt their tourism and everything else.  Do they do a lot of tourism, though?  I mean, I don't think Haiti does that well in tourism.  No, I don't think they do that great.  But people do go there.  I guarantee you they're going to, at least they're going to get rebuilt now.  I mean, there's no plus side of it.  But they will get, at least they'll have, the money will be put in there and they'll get something built.  Well, those places are really tough to rebuild because these, well, this is a, did I say hurricane earlier? 
[00:09:30]  Uh, this earthquake, okay.  But a lot of hurricanes take out these freaking islands.  I was just down in, uh, Atlantis, you know, in the Bahamas.  And the locals, they just talk about, they live their lives in between, you know, hurricanes that just completely wipe out the island.  And then they've got to rebuild.  And you can't really rebuild.  I guess, and the problem is.  You kind of just patch it back together.  Can you put in stuff that doesn't, because a seven there is probably like a ten here. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, easily.  Because the structures are not, you know.  Easily.  They're not San Francisco built structures.  No, they don't got that much money coming in where they could, you know, build this, uh, their, uh, houses and whatnot stronger.  So, you know.  They're in deep shit.  They're in deep shit.  Absolutely.  But it is so much easier when it's not you.  It's, it's really like meeting like half a million fucking people.  Two hundred thousand people, for some reason, seem like more to me because the number sounds like more than a half million. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Um, but it's like, if that happened in the U.S.  Because half is a fraction.  Maybe.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Psychologically, you're like, oh, it's a fraction.  No, it's not.  It's a half a million people.  It wasn't registering how many people that is.  And it's right.  If, if, if five thousand people died here, you know, it's, it's a national tragedy.  That's, that's a lot of people.  Well, you know what's weird?  Uh, we talk about this on the show a lot.  Um, when you see death in a foreign place, it doesn't bother you as much.  You know, we've, we've all talked about that.  But now with this, like, social network and everything, you don't really feel like it's that far away anymore. 
[00:11:00]  When you jump on Twitter and within one click you can see someone's pictures that happened minutes ago in, in Haiti.  It's, it's right in front of your face now.  It's not that news footage that's a little grainy because they don't have, uh, the same equipment as us and, and all that.  It's, it's, it's way realer in this day and age.  The big news here is, uh, what's going to happen, uh, late night wars.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Look at that.  We're, we're still all over the Conan Leno thing. 
[00:11:30]  I mean, if the news really did their jobs, they would probably do around the clock coverage, you know, with this Haiti thing.  And I mean, locally and all the news channels, cause this is just, this is unbelievable.  This is going to be worse than Katrina and the rest of them.  Yeah.  How many people died in Katrina?  I don't know.  Do we have any, do we have those numbers?  That's a very good question.  I don't know.  Even that wasn't as hard cause it wasn't like New York or Jersey.  It was bad cause it was the U S right.  So you felt like you felt it cause I've been in New Orleans, you've been in New Orleans. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  The farther it is away from you, the less impact you feel.  I think it's more, the, the richer the people that die in the tragedy, the more tragic in a lot of people's stupid brains.  I don't, you know what though, but when it, when it happens in California and the California wildfires,  I kind of look at the way I do Katrina.  It's like, I feel it.  I'm like, wow, that sucks.  And it's terrible.  And they're Americans, but it's a, it's, it's easier for me because it's not my, my area.  I root for fire.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of fire.  I don't like fire at all. 
[00:12:30]  I'm a big fan of fire.  When people start building their, their fucking multimillion dollar homes and stuff in these  really nice areas that I want to hike in.  And then they, they put up fences and you can't, you can't walk on their land anymore.  And when that fire kind of sweeps through, part of me is like, you weren't supposed to  be there to begin with.  You know how mad at you they'd be if like all that was happening and you were standing  outside with, I'm a, I'm a fan of fire on a sign.  Right, right.  You know how annoyed they'd be with you?  Hey, you just gave me an idea for a video. 
[00:13:00]  1,800 people, uh, batting Katrina, which is like, no, I thought it was more than that.  Only 1,800 people died in New Orleans?  I thought it was more than that too, but come on.  That number has to be way higher than that.  No?  I'm still looking for it.  Guess not.  That's the first answer.  Wow.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  Eric.  Hey, to put it through a proportion for you.  So, um, imagine a 9-11 happening for 166 straight days.  That's a million people. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  Hmm.  What's worse, 9-11 or an earthquake in Haiti?  I mean, sorry to say-  I would bet a lot of people would say, uh, 9-11.  I would, I would, I would guess a lot of people would say that.  Yeah, yeah.  And why would they say that?  That's a good question today.  They would say, their argument would be because it was not an act of God or an act of nature.  It was an act of whatever, and it was a targeted, purposeful, I mean, you know, the motives,  they would argue, but, you know, obviously, 500,000 people dead is worse.  Oh, absolutely.  Uh, let me say hi to Jim in New Hampshire. 
[00:14:00]  Jim.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Hello, Jim.  Hey, I, uh, just heard you guys talking about the earthquake in Haiti, and, uh, first I've  heard of it, so I switched over to X-130, the POTUS political station, and they were  talking about the late night stuff.  Oh, really?  Hey, they didn't even talk about it.  I was like, what the hell?  They're going to write about late night.  I'm sure they've covered it before.  Yeah, I'm cool.  Pug it out.  Uh, thank you, sir.  Uh, what is the latest on, uh, Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien, and there's rumors now Jay 
[00:14:30]  Leno's going to leave NBC because he feels like he was mistreated, and...  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Ah, it's, it's all over the place.  It's just, uh, just the, the dumb rumor mill.  Yeah.  Because he feels like he's looking like an idiot, like he's forcing Conan out and all  that, so.  Um, and man, people are really taking sides.  It's amazing.  On Twitter, on Facebook, people are yelling at me on Twitter going, huh, how could you  support Jay Leno?  Conan got fucked, and then they got that Conan thing.  Yeah, there it is.  What is that? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, I'm with Coco that people are putting on their Facebook and on their Twitter, and  it's basically a black and white picture of Conan O'Brien in front of an American flag  and his hair and the word Coco is in, uh, bright orange.  The fact that people are actually taking sides in, in what is just a botched management decision...  Right.  ...is mind-boggling to me.  Yeah.  ...that anybody cares that much.  They're both gonna be very fine.  And they're yelling at me on Twitter, and I'm like, look, Jay Leno had us on his show. 
[00:15:30]  Jimmy's part of the Jay Leno show, a big part at this point.  Yeah, I'm supporting Leno.  And I don't, again, I don't know Conan, so I can't...  And I think Conan got fucked as well, and I hear he's a great guy, and, uh, of course  he knows what he's doing with his late-night show.  Unfortunately, the ratings, uh, weren't kind to him, you know, for the first seven months.  But, yeah, I'm supporting Leno.  He didn't have enough time.  You know, look, if you gave Conan, I think it took Jay, like, three years to be, to get 
[00:16:00]  the ratings, and then he kept him for, like, six, I think he was up on for 16 years.  But he didn't get fucked as bad as Leno, because Leno, in the middle of being number  one, was told, we're replacing you in five years, because if we don't, Conan's gonna leave  now.  Any of you out there, picture succeeding at your job, the best you, like, you can't do  any better, and your boss comes and says, in five years, we're replacing you, and then  name a guy behind you who's good, but not as good at your job as you are. 
[00:16:30]  And then for five years, instead of bitching and moaning, you do your job, and you're still  the best at it, and then the boss does it anyway, and replaces you.  It's like, the anger that's gotta bring out.  So, if Conan would've come in, and let's just say was tying Letterman, or beating him by a  little bit, they probably wouldn't do this, but they can't, what if Conan doesn't beat  Letterman?  Right.  He might, but he might not, you don't know.  What are they supposed to do?  And Letterman's kicking his ass.  Yeah, I mean, Dave is...  What were you saying, by two million people or something?  Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's every night, but he's beating him by two million 
[00:17:00]  people, and...  It's not even close.  Don't forget, too, Letterman had a big bump with the whole match cheating thing.  Sure, he's had some stuff happen to him.  Sarah Palin, trying to get him, you know, knocked off the air.  But people that are siding against Leno, if you don't like Leno, that's one thing, but  it's people who think that Jay made a decision and changed his mind.  That's just not what happened.  Right.  It's not what happened.  Hey, Mike in PA, he's got a nice stat for everybody.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I was watching a commentator last night, and they were saying that proportionally in 
[00:17:30]  the United States, what happened in Haiti would be like if we had three million people  killed in one day.  Wow.  I mean, as far as as many people that live there?  Yeah, like, you know, per capita, half a million of them being wiped out in a day is  equivalent to the three million of us getting wiped out in a day.  Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  So what percentage of the people of Haiti will be dead from this?  You're the math guy.  I have no clue.  If it was a million, I could tell you.  As far as what percentage, how does that three, there's 300 million Americans. 
[00:18:00]  So three million is one one hundredth, right?  Yeah.  One percent.  One percent of the population.  Right.  So maybe there's 50 million Haitians.  So.  All right.  Yeah.  So, well.  Wait.  Wait.  Now you confuse me.  All right.  So they're saying one percent.  There's a five million.  Three million.  So five hundred thousand.  If that's one percent would be.  Yeah.  OK.  How many people are in Haiti?  No, I can't be.  Maybe not.  No, five.  No, it's not five million either.  It's too early for math. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  I used to take like math.  Oh, 10 million.  I was off by 40 million people.  I'm an idiot.  Because I started doing the math.  I'm like, there's no way there's 50 million people in Haiti.  And that's when I gave up on the equation.  Nine million, seven hundred eighty thousand.  Just under 10 million in Haiti.  Can somebody, here's this, 500,000 people is what percent of that?  Do you know how to make that equation, Danny?  I don't know how to find out what a percentage is.  Of 10 million?  Yeah.  That would be... 
[00:19:00]  Five percent is 50 percent.  It's either 2 percent or 20 percent.  Wait, 50 percent of one million, 5 percent.  That's 5 percent of the population, I think.  Wait.  It would be 20 percent, right?  Help me out.  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with math.  You're killing me.  Dude, I'm just throwing out numbers, hoping one of them is close.  I think it's 20 percent.  If you go with 10 million, Danny's probably going to do the exact equation.  But I would say...  You might be right.  I would say just under 20 percent. 
[00:19:30]  Right?  It's about 19.  19 and a half percent.  19 and change.  Okay, so 19 percent of the United States population, say there's 300 million people, it's almost  60 million people.  Yeah.  So that guy was wrong, like, the equivalent.  I don't know how that works out with what that guy said.  It's a lot of people.  I'm quoting that guy.  He's some fucking guy that woke up 10 minutes ago and his balls are stuck to his leg.  But I'm quoting him like he's the census guy for the fucking planet.  But he's got sperm flakes on his belly and we're listening to him. 
[00:20:00]  Exactly.  He's got one sock on and his wife come off with the other one.  But I'm like, well, the leader of the world called and said, I'm an idiot.  Yeah, everyone's calling now.  It's 20 percent.  All right.  But look, I was going by what that man said.  Right.  So that's my fault.  Well, that man had his facts wrong.  Yeah, but he sounded confident.  Sure.  Let's say hi to Jason in a little city known as Cleveland.  Ah, Cleveland.  What's up, Jason?  Good morning, boys.  I see we're talking about some unpleasant things. 
[00:20:30]  So I figured I'd bring up a pleasantry.  I will be seeing a little E-N-E on the 26th of February in this wonderful city.  Yes, I miss Cleveland.  Fuck, I got to do a road trip with me.  You should.  Maybe I go to Cleveland.  And I'm a day late and a dollar short, but I'm bringing back Cat Noise Wednesday on a Thursday.  Meow.  Oh, wow.  Don't start that shit.  Even though I forgot that and hated it.  Cleveland, tickets go on sale?  They've been on sale already.  How are they doing? 
[00:21:00]  Very well.  So we don't have to plug it, thank God.  Yeah, February 26th.  One show?  I may do two.  I don't know.  I may do one.  You might back in another show, right?  Yeah, because there's not a whole lot of time.  Yeah.  There's not a whole lot of time.  Usually you like a little bit more time.  Cleveland in February.  Horrendous.  I know.  We've done that a few times, haven't we, over the years?  I'll have to leave a week early to make sure I don't get...  The fucking Cleveland Airport.  When I was coming from wherever, we were in Dallas.  We were coming from Dallas, and they said Cleveland was totally shut down because the  power's not at the airport.  Yeah.  So anybody going...  This was like 8 in the morning. 
[00:21:30]  Anybody going to Cleveland, they can't take flights until 6 at night.  Just why would you live there?  What?  There's great big meaty vaginas in Cleveland.  I really do love a Cleveland vagina more than I love most things.  Why are they so meaty?  I don't know.  Just to keep them warm in the winter?  That...  Fuck it.  You know what?  I mean, it might be that.  They put their hands in in case their car breaks down.  That's probably going to have big pussies in Cleveland.  Right.  They put their hands in.  Mitten holders.  Pussy holders.  That is the best fucking...  That is really a very sexy city.  I love Cleveland girls.  I mean, for real, love them.  Yeah, well, because they're trying to fuck their way out of that city, so... 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, they really are.  They're just trying to fuck their way out.  Where are you from, Cleveland?  There's something to be said about girls that want to fuck their way out of a certain town  or city.  Yeah, I like that.  I respect that.  You respect that, Jimmy?  Yeah, I certainly do.  Then you have the small talk.  No, no, really.  We'll keep in touch.  Bring in the Big Apple.  Yeah, maybe you visit New York.  Let me go to Bob in Connecticut.  Bob?  Hey.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  You guys can make all the dick jokes you want, but listening to you and Jimmy do math, 
[00:22:30]  it's fucking hilarious to me.  Dude, I can't believe how bad I am at it.  That's why I'll never be a great chess player.  I'll always be average at best, because to be a great chess player, that side of your  brain has to function a certain way, and I just can't do it.  Well, what's even sad, or Jimmy at least admits he's bad at math, that was my whole thing  growing up.  I really was a math whiz.  I was one of those kids in fifth, sixth grade.  I was taking high school math.  I was that dork, and I can't even do an easy fucking percentage equation, but it's early 
[00:23:00]  in the morning.  People know how many times Opa said he's a math whiz, but then whenever there's tough  math to do, like Opa will do math whiz stuff really fast.  Like 50, what percent of that is 100?  Opa will go, oh, that's 50% of 100.  I mean, you know, math whiz.  Yeah.  What percent is this?  Ah, Danny, Google.  I just couldn't figure it out.  I gave up on that side of my brain a while ago, though.  That side doesn't work anymore.  Unfortunately, I was never good at English and speaking, and that's what I do for a living.  I was really supposed to be, for real, I was supposed to be like a doctor or a scientist. 
[00:23:30]  My English skills and all that were always horrendous.  So what am I doing?  What am I doing?  I should be just, I should be like the perfect mind, just writing equations on a wall somewhere.  I just want to pretend that you didn't just say that you should have been a doctor or a scientist.  I swear to God, dude, that's the sad part.  I was a really good student.  I know it doesn't show here on a daily basis, but somewhere along the line, I was like that. 
[00:24:00]  I was just bored.  I was bored at how easy it came to me that I went with this, which was way more challenging.  And I'm still trying to figure it out many, many years later.  I should just go back to math.  Now they're saying that we're way off.  Bernie in Ohio.  Bernie.  Hey.  Opie.  What's up?  Comedian Jim Norton.  Hello, sir.  All right.  Let's see.  If you had 10 million people and 1 million would have died, that would be 10%. 
[00:24:30]  Because 10 times 1 is 10.  Right.  So if you take half of 1 million.  5%.  That would be 5%.  I said 5%.  Did you say 5%?  You did say that.  I did.  Thank you.  But you didn't stand on it.  I wavered, sir.  I was nervous.  So then if it's 5%, then that other guy, is he close to right, sir?  I don't know.  Wait.  He said 3 million.  No.  He was down to 3 million. 
[00:25:00]  How many are in there?  He was telling you 300 million.  That's probably way off also.  In the U.S.?  How many are in the U.S.?  I couldn't even tell you.  I don't know if there's a billion or what.  A billion?  No.  There's not a billion people in the United States.  There's a billion Chinese.  The Chinese got that type of number and not us.  I don't even know what we got.  But I know that 5% of 10 million I know is 500,000.  All right. 
[00:25:30]  That's always right.  That's about the extent of my math knowledge.  Why are we all doing schoolwork?  It's just too early for this.  That guy, when that guy called up and he said that this percent dying would be like 3 million dying here.  Right.  You wanted to just get a perspective on what he meant because that's a lot of 3 million.  3 million Americans killed in something.  3 million into 300 million would be 1%.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  1%.  So was I right?  The Haiti thing is 5%. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I fucked up.  I did the math backwards.  I divided the wrong number into the wrong number.  It should have been the other way around.  I wanted to see if people understand the stupidity that's happening in this room.  There's fucking three computers here.  Yeah, it's not even just we're sitting here with just our brains.  We got computers and fucking.  I'm a high school dropout.  I'm the last person you people should be asking to do math equations at 630 in the morning.  It was the fact that Danny picked up his phone like problem solved, help has arrived.  He picked up and I looked at him and I'm so easily fucking, I'm such a gullible dope. 
[00:26:30]  Blue Heeler writes, Eastside Dave says he hit a hole in one and Opie claims he's a math wizard.  202 has some talented motherfuckers.  Well, that's a willful boy in Jersey, pretty accurate.  Opie's SAT scores 900 in math, 10 in verbal.  Let's go to Richard in Pennsylvania.  Richard.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hello.  Pretty good. 
[00:27:00]  Hey.  Hey, what is the size of the island?  I know it can't be bigger than Maryland.  I mean, it's a small little state for 10,000 people.  And isn't it attached to the Dominican Republic?  That's what I see.  Is it attached to anything or is it just an island?  I think it's attached.  I think half of it is the Dominican Republic, which a lot of people like to go to on vacation  and avoid Haiti.  Where's my fucking creepy manager when we need him?  Jonathan Branstein right now would be the fucking guy to talk to because he's been there, I think. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, sir.  Hey, real quick.  Last night I was flipping through some videos and I seen a video of you laughing your ass off  when Steve the Whittler was in the room there.  Yes.  That video had me crying.  You were turning your head, laughing your ass off when Steve was whistling in the corner there.  That was when Ope kept fucking up the music and he kept stopping the cue.  And me and Ant were both so uncomfortable.  Anthony was hiding.  The old NEW monitor, Ant could hide behind the monitors. 
[00:28:00]  It went like around a little.  It was almost like a little corner.  And Anthony was kind of hiding behind the monitors.  Uh-huh.  And I couldn't look at Steve and Ope was just sitting there and he kept stopping the tape.  It was so uncomfortable.  Yeah, because he needed his CD to whistle along to.  And I just would start the CD.  He would get into it.  And just when he was really, you know, starting to whistle nice, I would stop the CD on him.  Over and over and over again.  And the guy would just keep hanging in there.  And Jimmy and Anthony gave up on the whole thing.  They were so mortified. 
[00:28:30]  It was classic.  That's all I got.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir.  It's one of my favorite bits of all time.  That's Steve the Whistler.  More math problems?  We got them coming in, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Ope is 100% correct.  Haiti is the other half of the Dominican Republic.  Okay.  What a weird piece of land that is.  Because a lot of people love the Dominican Republic as far as vacationing and such.  And Haiti, not so much.  Where do they go in the Dominican Republic?  To vacation.  To beaches.  And then I think they got some rainforest type shit. 
[00:29:00]  You could do some of that zip lining, I think.  And I also hear monkeys will just walk right into your hotel room or whatever.  Or your cabana.  Wherever the hell you're staying.  There's monkeys everywhere.  How do I not know any of this shit?  Because you don't go on vacation.  I study this shit.  And then decide every spring where I'm going.  I wonder if Branstein's in New York.  I really would love to ask him about Haiti.  He would know everything that we're trying to figure out.  He knows weird shit, though. 
[00:29:30]  He would know who the assistant mayor was during the coup.  Just shit that you're never going to ask or never need to know.  Just ridiculous stuff.  Things that will get you out of a fucking kidnapping or beheading.  People love Jonathan because he knows something about them.  People like when you know about them.  Sure.  And parky attendant guys.  And all those guys that will let you through the gate.  They're all from these weird little African countries.  Jonathan will talk to those guys.  So he must have a lot of fun just getting in a cab in New York.  Because those guys have a story to tell if you ever start talking to them. 
[00:30:00]  Every fucking...  They're blown away by what he knows about them.  If he's like...  He'll say, where are you from?  And they'll tell him.  You know, again, it's an African country that you may have heard of.  But he knows who the fucking mayor is.  He knows the capital.  He knows the native language.  He knows everything.  It's really fucking enraging.  Right.  And M. Zeno, thank you, from Philly.  Yes.  Punta Cana.  I think that's how you say it.  It's a hell of a place to go in the Dominican Republic.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be real nice.  As far as Haiti goes, what is this Robertson saying about it?  He's saying they're cursed? 
[00:30:30]  Pat Robertson.  No.  What he was saying was...  Do we have audio of that?  Because we played...  They played a lot of red-eye last night.  Why would we have that audio?  Yeah, that's a big one.  That is a big one.  Because he's basically saying they deserve what they got or something.  He wasn't saying it that harshly.  He was saying...  There's a legend that there was some voodoo performed when they were under the heel of  the French, as he put it.  And they were.  And they won 12 years later.  They fought the French and they freed themselves from the French.  But he was saying that the legend has it. 
[00:31:00]  I guess the Haitian legend or something, that there was voodoo involved with it.  So he's saying that way back then they made a deal with the devil.  And basically this is what happens.  But he wasn't being malicious.  I'll say that.  I'm not even defending what he said.  It was ridiculous.  He's just...  How about he just shuts his fucking mouth?  You know who put it into perspective?  The girl who was on red-eye last night, Essie Cup.  She's like a conservative.  She's hot and she's smart.  But she said, look, he's a scriptural literalist. 
[00:31:30]  And that's what they do.  That's what they think.  Everything that happens has biblical...  How about we get all the bodies out of the rubble and then you can say whatever the  hell you want, Mr. Robertson.  He'll donate a lot of money, though.  His timing is shitty.  Yes, it is.  You want to hear what you're going to say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Because I honestly have not heard this.  So maybe I should shut up until I hear it as well.  Go ahead, Danny.  And you know, Christy, something happened a long time ago in Haiti.  And people might not want to talk about it.  They were under the heel of the French. 
[00:32:00]  You know, Napoleon III and whatever.  And they got together and swore a pact to the devil.  They said, we will serve you if you'll get us free from the French.  True story.  And so the devil said, okay, it's a deal.  Well, and they kicked the French out.  You know, the Haitians revolted and got themselves free.  But ever since, they have been cursed by one thing after the other, desperately poor. 
[00:32:30]  That island of Hispanola is one island.  It's cut down the middle.  On the one side is Haiti.  On the other side is the Dominican Republic.  Dominican Republic is prosperous, healthy, full of resorts, etc.  Haiti is in desperate poverty.  Same island.  They need to have, and we need to pray for them, a great turning to God.  And out of this tragedy, I'm optimistic something good may come.  But right now, we're helping the suffering people. 
[00:33:00]  And the suffering is unimaginable.  Absolutely, Patton.  He is getting money.  Gutfeld, again, is such a smart guy.  He raised a good point.  Even though he says dumb shit, he raises a lot of money.  Yeah, I mean, there's a number right on the screen as he's talking how to donate to the cause.  But, yeah, that is, well, how do you get rid of that devil thing?  That's what he should be talking about if he believes in that whole devil thing, this Pat Robertson.  They have to turn, but to answer his question, how is the Dominican Republic prosperous? 
[00:33:30]  That is a strange thing.  Could be the government.  It's like, look at North America, South America, it's the same piece of land.  But I would have, if you take Mexico City or parts of Mexico and, you know, Texas and the U.S., big difference.  But this is a small island, Jimmy, too.  Yeah.  I would love to know the size of that, but now we have to go into another classroom.  Yeah.  We're not doing well in math this morning.  I don't know if we want to go into, which one would that be?  Social studies?  I don't even know.  Western civ?  No, Eastern Western civ? 
[00:34:00]  I don't have a fucking idea.  I don't know fucking who knows.  World politics.  But you see what he said wasn't, it's like, when she, when she, when SC Cup said scriptural  literalist, I'm like, yeah, it's hard to even get mad at the guy.  That's just what he does.  He's an old guy who believes in the scriptures word for word.  But if you make, if you make a deal with the devil, how do you, how do you get rid of  the deal?  I was wondering.  How do you break your contract?  How do you contact him?  Is there small talk?  Yeah.  That's what he should be talking about.  Or are they fucked forever? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  For real?  I want to know.  No, apparently the devil honors his contracts for certain people.  Thank you.  The devil's more honorable.  Yes, he is.  We know that, right, Jimmy?  Yes, we do.  Are you sad today?  No.  All right, good.  Greg in D.C.  Hey, Greg.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  How are you today?  Pretty good.  And I also wanted to say hello to Chip Jefferson.  You don't get a lot of love on the show, Chip.  We love you out here.  It's Chip Jefferson, stupid.  Don't say my name wrong.  I apologize, Jefferson. 
[00:35:00]  Sorry.  Anyway, if you guys don't mind, I can be your homeschool teacher today.  I teach math and science in a Catholic school, so I can answer all these questions for you.  Wow.  That means you work with Haitian kids, too, I'm reading.  95% of the kids in my school are Caribbean or African, and we have about 10% of the kids in  any class are Haitian.  Do you know any, do you speak any, uh, any?  Creole?  Creole, yeah.  They speak Creole.  I know I worked with the guy, Philippe and Lionel, they were Haitians. 
[00:35:30]  Year, when I started comedy, like in 87, uh, no, I'm sorry, I started in 1990.  I worked with these guys, like, in 89.  Get baboon caca.  Am I saying that right?  Uh, I don't know any of the curse words.  Okay, that's a nasty one.  Oh, really?  Is it good?  Yeah, they would always teach you the Haitian dirty words.  No, get baboon caca.  It was something about pile of shit.  Um, I fucking forget.  They were really funny guys, though, man.  They were really fucking funny guys.  Oh, yeah, no, it's great.  The family, the Haitian families are all, I mean, they are so loving and happy, and no 
[00:36:00]  matter how bad things are, they typically still try to see the happy, fun side of things.  Um, and just a real quick aside, I went to a funeral lunch for, uh, one of the Haitian  members of our community, and everybody was drinking at 10 o'clock in the morning.  And everybody was laughing and having a great time, and just having a wonderful time at  a funeral.  Yeah, what do they drink?  That's a good question.  What's their drink?  Oh, my God.  They've got the best rum.  It's called Four Star or Five Star, but in, uh, Haitian, it's, uh, Barbacore. 
[00:36:30]  It is the greatest rum you've ever had.  So how would you answer Pat Roberts?  Why is, uh, Dominican Republic doing well in Haiti?  Not?  Okay, Dominican Republic speaks Spanish.  Haiti speaks Rio.  In the Dominican Republic, they still had a lot of, they had a lot of ties with Cuba.  So they still had a lot of the wealth that, uh, was associated with that originally.  There's a lot of people who are, uh, on the Haitian side, there's just a lot of corruption  in the government.  There always has been.  Um, there are millions of people who live in slums. 
[00:37:00]  And if you're looking at how many people compare, uh, in Haiti are part of this compared to the  United States, it's actually more like 17.5 million people in the United States would have  to have had this problem.  We would have had to have had an earthquake that affected the United States from Tennessee  over to the East Coast for us to exact, to understand how much of that island was affected.  But most of the problem in Haiti is because, and I know you guys have talked about this,  the little shanty towns, the fact that people are pushed so close together and living in 
[00:37:30]  such slums and such awful areas that they're never going to see help.  Is there poverty, is it, is it anything like we've seen in India and slumdog billionaires  and not that bad?  Yes.  No, it is that bad.  Wow.  They have parts of Haiti that are ruled simply by gangs.  There are, the government doesn't go there.  The police don't go there.  Nobody goes there.  There are areas that are literally two square miles that are run by 10 gangs. 
[00:38:00]  It's just, it's disgusting and you can't get around it.  There's no way to fix it because it's been going on for so long.  As far as Pat Robertson, uh, is saying with voodoo, voodoo is something that they've practiced  there for hundreds of years.  Um, they didn't make a pact with the devil, but, um, you know, Pat Robertson's an idiot,  but there are people there who still practice voodoo.  It's something they do, but we have people who practice voodoo here and they're some of  the same people who speak Creole, um, down in Louisiana and those areas. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  It's part of the, it's, it's not what everyone says voodoo is, you know, voodoo is more of  a way to get through something, but the same people who practice voodoo believe in God.  Now, did the archbishop of Haiti was killed when in this, yeah.  Oh, in this, in this, uh, earthquake.  Okay.  Okay.  So is this a game changer for Haiti, you think, or do they go right back to where they were  before the earthquake eventually? 
[00:39:00]  Honestly, uh, the people that I've talked to, the people who have families there, they  don't think that it's going to be able to change even with something as simple as this,  because first you have to get bigger.  Haitians can't go to the Dominican Republic because Dominicans hate Haitians.  But aren't they, hold on, but they're, they're the same people basically, right?  No.  What, what's, what's the main difference?  Is it a religious difference?  It's a religious difference.  It's a background.  It's a, it's a verbal.  Well, what are the two religions?  They don't even speak the same language.  Okay, they don't speak the same language, even though they're on the same island. 
[00:39:30]  And, and, uh, but what are the two religions we're talking about here?  We're talking about Catholicism.  It's almost like being Irish and being, um, uh, yeah, okay.  Um, I'm trying to think of the two warring Irish and I, I'm drawing a complete blank.  A Protestant and, um, but it's a Protestant and Catholics.  Right.  There's not really a big difference.  The big, you know, they both believe in the same God and everything that has to do with that God.  There's just a minor tweaking and it's the same thing. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, we gotta get rid of that minor tweaking.  It's fucking up a lot of things.  It's not, it's not a huge difference between Protestants and Catholics.  Right.  Um, and on the island of Haiti, the people who have lived there as long as they have,  the Dominicans were never ruled by the French.  The Dominicans were never treated like the French treated the Haitians.  The Dominicans were never, um, brought down and made subservient like the French made the, uh, Haitians.  The Haitians fought back, kicked the French out, and had no form of government, no real, uh, centralized government. 
[00:40:30]  The United States didn't step in to try to fix it.  And so the Haitians began, became what they are, which is a group of people who, you know,  the people who are really dirt poor, um, are ruled by whoever's near them.  The people who have money live near the capital.  Um, the other thing is, and I'm not sure if you guys have talked about this yet this morning,  is that that island is located right next to what is called the Caribbean, I believe it's the Caribbean shelf. 
[00:41:00]  Um, but it is one of the tectonic plates.  So that island should have been decimated by, uh, you know, earthquakes several times over.  Um, and if Danny can pull it up, you can pull up a map of the tectonic plates, uh, maybe even just in the Caribbean,  you will see that that island is right next to that plate.  And so the fact that this was a 7.1 is not that impressive when you look at the fact that it is on a plate.  And those plates, when they shift, this will happen. 
[00:41:30]  We'll just lose the whole island.  We're not going to lose the island.  We're going to lose everybody on the island.  Sure.  Um, because these islands in that, you know, those islands are not built for hurricanes.  Right.  Even though, and if you can get that map up, you'll see that the islands are so close to these plates.  The, you know, these islands are moving.  Um, you know, they're only moving inches, even centimeters a year, but, um, there are islands that are closer to other plates, like in Africa.  Greece, in the next 100,000 years, is going to be part of Africa because of the movement of the tectonic plates. 
[00:42:00]  Let me ask you a question.  When they shift, right, when an earthquake happens, that's when the plates kind of snap back like a rubber band?  They're rubbing.  Well, no, it's not that they're, it depends.  I mean, if you're talking about simplification where it goes under a plate and it causes, uh, mountains, like India, the Himalayas are because India crashed into Asia and it continues to crash into Asia at a rate of almost, uh, almost an inch every other, every six years in the Himalayas are rising because of the tectonic movements. 
[00:42:30]  So it depends on which type of movement you're talking about, but go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  So what happened, so, uh, that's what I'm trying to ask you is how much did they move for this to happen?  It, again, it, just for an earthquake, it could just be, it could be as simple as a hiccup.  It could be as simple as just a little bit of movement for everything around it.  You know, if this tectonic plate movement had happened out in the Pacific, we would have had a tsunami. 
[00:43:00]  So it, you know, it all depends on where it is, um, and what type of, uh, movement there was, you know, what type of, uh, earthquake we're getting.  Um, but again, for this particular earthquake that we had over, like, Haiti, it was most likely, it was just as simple, it wasn't things snapping apart.  Um, they were coming together.  If they had come apart, we would have seen lava, we would have seen volcanic activity or something like that.  So it was the plates rubbing against each other right here. 
[00:43:30]  And it was, it was just a very small, very short movement of plates rubbing against each other that created that earthquake.  What's the American plate and the Caribbean plate, right?  Uh, it's the Caribbean plate.  I don't know.  I'm watching the news.  I'm watching the news.  I wanted to just say it.  They're talking about the American plate and the Caribbean plate.  Yeah.  And I, I think the Caribbean plate would be much, uh, tastier than the American plate.  What do you think?  Hey, uh.  Well, you guys have microphones.  You guys are the smart ones here.  Hey, Greg, a lot of knowledge.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  And, uh, wow.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  A lot of people say in Haiti is 100% corrupt and Dominican Republic, the Republic is like 100% tourism.  So very, very, very different.  Now, how many people go to Haiti on vacation?  No, they don't like white people.  I mean, it's not that Haitians don't like white people.  It's that the poor, the really disgusting areas that are, um, that are run by the gangs,  they're not real fans of Caucasians and they will kill you.  Um, now in the good areas, you know, near the Capitol, near Port-au-Prince and a few other  places, they're fine.  What people are really worrying about and what the families I've spoken to are worried about 
[00:44:30]  is that in these really poor areas that are run by gangs, it's going to be like, uh,  Africa.  It's going to be like some of the other areas, um, that, uh, have had devastation happen  where we send aid and the aid is immediately gobbled up by the gangs and then they sell  them or they try to make more money off of this.  And with it, it's going to be tough.  Sure.  Kind of like in Somalia.  Yes.  One hundred percent.  Right on.  Oh, thanks a lot. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you.  I appreciate the phone call.  You're welcome, guys.  Have a good morning.  All right.  And, uh, sorry for the people writing, Zay.  What can I tell you?  It's a huge fucking story.  Yeah.  Who's bored by this?  It's like, it's, it's, it is kind of interesting is what's going on.  I, I honestly have no fucking knowledge about Haiti.  Yeah.  I enjoyed that phone call.  Actually, uh, got some knowledge out.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Texas.  Jeff.  What's up, boys?  Hey, brother.  Hey, man.  Uh, look, you know, uh, let me preface what I'm fixing to say by, by, uh, by saying first 
[00:45:30]  that, you know, this is a, this is a big time deal, a huge tragedy.  And, uh, you know, I think everybody's hearts go over there, but, you know, two, two years  ago, Hurricane Ike, you know, comes through down here in the, in the golden triangle of  Texas.  And, and, uh, you know, it just, it pisses me off a little bit and, and, and, and, and  maybe, maybe I'm looking at it wrong.  You know, it pisses me off a little bit, you know, watching TV last night, you see several  people come across the TV, call this number to donate this money, call, you know, call this 
[00:46:00]  number, donate $10, anything else, you know, where were these fucking people at when goddamn  Americans needed help?  How many, how many people were killed in Hurricane Ike?  I don't know.  Uh, you know, I don't know the exact death toll, but in, in the town that I live in, Jimmy,  uh, all but 17 houses were flooded out.  You know, I mean, you have, you have people displaced, they're still displaced to this  day.  Yeah, we, we, well, it's a, it's a, it's a bigger thing.  I mean, we got a lot of problems in this country, but you see something like this happen  down in Haiti and next thing you know, everyone's opening up their wallets and, uh, donating 
[00:46:30]  all over the place.  Yeah, but, but is it just me or does that seem to be a reoccurring theme these days that,  that Americans are willing to help, you know, people all over the globe before we help ourselves?  And I just think that's a little fucked up.  I don't think we, I don't really think we help ourselves that, that well.  That's for sure.  Well, don't forget, dude, Katrina, look where Katrina, the...  Donate money to your local soup kitchen, you know, help, help feed the homeless and hungry.  Dude, 92, 103 direct people killed, 92 indirectly, 26 missing. 
[00:47:00]  So that's like, and again, I'm not minimizing it and saying that who cares, but it's, it's,  it's like you're talking about like 25 people, which again, all right, that sucks, but it's  not on the level of awareness of 500,000.  Right, that's why I made it a bigger issue that there's so many, so many problems in America  that we just kind of...  Right, I know, I know.  I'm just talking about, you know, Americans helping Americans.  I think this is also the supposition that Americans are going to be helped.  I'm not saying it's always right.  Do Americans help Americans?  That's a very good question.  I think so, yeah.  Besides the whole tax thing? 
[00:47:30]  No, yeah, we do.  I mean, you know, a lot of people, you know, our tax dollars are helping.  And a lot of people weren't aware of some of the devastation in the smaller towns, you  know, in Texas, because we weren't like New Orleans.  You know, we didn't sit back and say, well, what's the government going to do?  You only lost two more people.  You know, we didn't do that.  All right.  We came back in, we busted our ass, and, you know, we...  Calm down, sir.  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, it just, you know, I think we should be helping Americans  a lot more.  We understand that you think that, and you're not wrong, but you're not wrong, sir. 
[00:48:00]  You're not wrong.  We should help Americans.  But when you look at Katrina, and the way Houston took in the Katrina victims, and the  way the public itself, the government was horrendous with Katrina.  They did a terrible fucking job.  Sure.  But the people, the Americans did nothing but a comic relief, or there's a hundred charities  for Katrina.  So American citizens absolutely help American citizens.  Okay.  Okay.  I see your point. 
[00:48:30]  You know, I mean, you know, I agree with that to a certain extent, you know, but I don't  know.  I don't know.  Anyway.  All right.  Take care, man.  Okay, Josh.  Thank you.  He's all heated.  All right.  Let's go to, we're heading toward our first break.  We're going to have Mustard in here, and we got Nick DiPaolo stopping by.  We're going to have a good show today.  Nastasha from Brooklyn.  What do you got, Nastasha?  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Not the caller that just hung up, but the previous caller, the teacher, he gave you guys 
[00:49:00]  a lot of info, but a few things that he said weren't necessarily accurate as far as,  Haitians don't necessarily hate Caucasians.  That's not true.  I'm born here.  My mom's been here since she was elementary school age.  However, there is a problem with the Dominican Republic, and Haiti is a system with the elite,  and there's like the dark-skinned versus the fair-skinned people in Haiti, and that's kind 
[00:49:30]  of where the animosity starts between the two portions of the island, and that you have  these people who are dark complexion, considered the Africans, who were forth to work, whereas  the fairer complexion Haitians were usually treated a little better and things like that,  and with regard to Haiti, there's a lot, there is a lot of corruption.  If you look back the past maybe 65 years of government control, you start out with papa  docs and baby docs, who basically declared themselves a ruler for life, and forced these 
[00:50:00]  people, they forced out all of the educated professionals of the island, all the teachers,  all the doctors, all the educators, gone, because you have these people in the streets  killing everyone, where they're putting female criminals in charge and making regular  educated citizens afraid to just live, and that's kind of where the island started to  go downhill, because once your education, once the basic stability of the island is gone, 
[00:50:30]  what else is there, and that's where we end up now, is you have an island now, where  there are no more educated people, where there are no more teachers, where there are no more  people who basically care about the growth of the island, and more about themselves and  making a profit for themselves, and that's kind of what happens.  All this thinking.  Your head hurts, imagine us.  I mean, all this historical, ma'am, slow down, I mean from all this historical knowledge,  I just, I don't know any of this stuff. 
[00:51:00]  Please tell us that Jimmy and I will not be quizzed on this, we don't want to be quizzed  on this.  Do you remember anything that has been said, Jimmy?  No.  You want a pop quiz?  No, I take like bullet points of like, there's too much knowledge.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a lot, and the thing is, also with Pat Roberts.  Look, let's be honest, three months from now, we're not even going to care about Haiti.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  All right, and then you guys got to go on caring about it.  That's a little taste of reality for you.  We're getting a little Haitian knowledge and a little Dominican Republic. 
[00:51:30]  Republican knowledge today, but come on.  We got our own problems.  A lot of people fail to realize that right now it's all heartbreaking, but maybe next  week something's going to happen.  Something's going to go to a press conference and no one's going to care.  You guys better hope that everyone donates within the next two or three days because the  next big event, CNN, is gone.  Uh-huh.  They're gone and on to the next one, so hopefully you guys will, you know, get a lot of money  in the next few days.  And it's not just Americans, though.  It's actual other Haitians.  The Haitian dance floor that's in America, they're going to forget, too. 
[00:52:00]  And, you know, it's just sad because these people are dying.  And, you know, like you said, it's only until maybe Saturday.  And after Saturday, got to be with them.  All right.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Mike in the Bronx.  Mikey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Are you pushing for the Jets?  I just wanted to say.  Or talk about whatever you want.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, I was looking at all those pictures from Haiti, and I just couldn't tell if it was  before or after the earthquake.  What's that? 
[00:52:30]  We heard you.  Punch it out, guys.  That old gag.  I don't know.  I was just trying to have a little conversation, working a little football thing there.  Oh, boy.  He was all geared up to get his joke out.  He was not going to be diverted.  He wanted nothing to do with me.  He wanted to get his light out.  You want to take our first break, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm starving, man.  I'm kind of hungry, too.  I am fucking hungry.  You know what?  Matt in Toronto.  Matt, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  We're going to end with you.  Please redeem all Americans for me. 
[00:53:00]  The guy from Texas, is he seriously comparing a couple houses that have wet couches in the  basement to 500 million people dying?  500,000.  500,000.  No, I don't think he was comparing that to you.  He was saying that the way Americans are focusing on stuff, he probably feels like his town was  totally ignored by the news.  No, he wasn't saying anything stupid.  Yeah, in his world, it means everything.  You know what I'm saying?  But as soon as we started doing the research on what happened down there in Texas and realized  200 people died, it's like, all right, buddy, maybe we could talk about that in March 
[00:53:30]  when this Haitian thing is under control.  But right now, we're looking at a half million people in Haiti dead.  Yeah.  And, Jimmy, I was really excited to hear about your Canadian tour that you were announcing  shortly, right?  Yes, I am, actually.  Why won't...  You should do that.  I know.  You could do...  What are you waiting for, Jimmy?  We're waiting for you.  It's hard for me to get away from that kind of time, because between this show and Leno,  it's like, it's hard for me to just leave.  Can't you do a, let's do a Toronto, Montreal, and is there somewhere in between that Jimmy 
[00:54:00]  could do?  It's about all of the good in Canada right there.  That's about it.  I want to fucking do a co-headline gig with Carla Homolka.  You'll find her in Montreal.  She's hiding out somewhere.  Oh, is she in Montreal?  Who is she?  Oh, my God.  I mean, they're the fucking best half of the...  Yeah, well, I wouldn't even say cereal, because they killed two people, but...  Oh, oh, that's...  That one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know that one.  Dirty couple they were.  Absolutely.  She was a naughty girl, Carla.  Sexy, though. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  She was sexy.  Cheers, boys.  Happy birthday.  Peace.  Yeah, right on.  Okay, we start there.  We're going to take a break.  Mustard is going to come in today.  Our little homeless friend who...  I'm stuck producing his album now, I guess, even though I don't know the first thing about  that.  Can I just write a check and just go here, make your album?  Yep.  Really?  Well, I'd give the check to someone else.  Is Mustard here?  Why is Kenny in?  I don't know.  No, you don't have to write a check.  There's a guy in Brooklyn with a recording studio that's willing to donate studio time 
[00:55:00]  and musicians.  Oh, okay.  Maybe we can get him on the phone today or something.  Oh, let's see what Mustard wants to do.  I don't know if...  I think Mustard works as just like a guitar...  Him and a guitar.  But what do I know?  You know a lot, G.H.  Don't sell yourself short.  Yeah?  What do I know?  No, you know a lot.  You haven't lasted this long in the business for not knowing anything.  All right.  I like that.  All right.  Is he here?  No.  No. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  Just hit that break.  Check it out, The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Starring Jim Norton today.  We got Nick DiPaolo coming in.  And our homeless friend Mustard is back.  I fucking love this story. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know why, but I really do.  What do you got in front of you, Jimmy?  It looks like you...  I'm just reading about Michael C. Hall, the star of Dexter, being treated for Hodgkin's  lymphoma cancer.  So I know very little about it, so of course I'm looking up symptoms, convinced that's  what I have.  Don't go on WebMD.  Ever.  They'll have you convinced you have cancer within two clicks.  Some of the symptoms are just so obvious.  Do you ever sweat?  Oh my God, yeah.  I do. 
[00:56:30]  Are you tired?  Yeah.  Yes, I've tiredness.  Oh my God.  Have you lost your appetite?  Well, no.  There's always one that...  All right, thank God.  Mustard.  How do we do this mustard thing?  This is a great little story.  Yes.  I know we don't like great little stories on this show.  We hate them.  Because we're not in touch with our emotions.  But this mustard guy has lived a life, and he's a very talented guy, and he ended up  on the streets, living in Washington Square Park, and Keith the cop found him for the 
[00:57:00]  homeless shopping spree.  He comes in, and he's just a fucking drunkard mess, and we're not thinking much of him,  to be honest with you.  And we find out that he knows how to play a guitar, so we find a guitar.  And this is so frustrating as far as the videos online.  We gave him a tailor, which is sitting in the studio once again today.  How much is this guitar?  Like a couple thousand?  Oh, yeah, easy.  Easy, two, three thousand.  Everybody doesn't want to acknowledge that the guy playing the guitar is a complete homeless 
[00:57:30]  mess.  They're like, he's not homeless.  If he's homeless, how can he afford a tailor guitar?  I think my dad is actually guilty of the same thing.  For real?  He's like, why is he playing?  I'm like, Dad, do you understand that he's in a radio complex?  Like, there's going to be a guitar hanging around somewhere?  I mean, the logic of some people frustrates the hell out of me.  It's like, you can't figure it out yourself why he might have a tailor guitar in his hands  because they're broadcasting from a radio facility.  I mean, obviously, most people out there have never seen these studios before. 
[00:58:00]  But I mean, they have, you know, they have tailor guitars just hanging up on the wall.  Yeah.  You know, signed $2,000 guitars.  And I'm not talking about the people that are just fucking around and going, oh, look  at the tailor guitar.  It's the people that really believe that the guy isn't homeless because he's playing a tailor  guitar.  It's like, just go away.  So anyway, he picks up the guitar and, you know, I wanted to control everything.  So he starts playing and I go, whoa, whoa, what are you going to play?  And he goes, don't worry about it.  I got this.  And he does a version of Radiohead's Creep that is just blown up around the world. 
[00:58:30]  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I was looking at Haiti.  Oh, no, it's just amazing, right?  The, the, uh, it's flat.  The, the, the, the shown footage of the ghettos, it's fucking flat.  It's like all the, the houses are just, it's just, it's like fucking flatland.  Yeah.  That's, that's how they build stuff.  It just sucks.  No, no.  I mean, after the, the, the, the, the, the, uh, earthquake, it's like it has knocked  everything down on this footage they were shown.  It's that easy in these, uh, these small Caribbean islands.  And there was a little kid walking around barefoot.  They all walk around barefoot.  And I'm like, you're walking through a dump barefoot. 
[00:59:00]  Well, it seemed worse.  But just the idea of that, I don't like to walk through the street here barefoot.  Right.  I, I won't do it.  Well, when we lose, uh, when we lose power in New York City, we all cry like bitches.  Yeah.  We don't know what to do with ourselves.  Where's everybody shitting and pissing there?  It's right in the street, Jimmy.  Come on.  Fuck.  They should organize and at least have a shit pile.  You have to.  A pile where you're allowed to shit.  And that's it.  So Mustard, uh, plays this, uh, yeah, this version of Creep.  And, uh, we put the video online and for the most part, it just went word of mouth. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, it got picked up by a bunch of websites, but in general, it's just a word of mouth thing.  And people are enjoying this video all over the fucking world.  I get comments on my YouTube channel from languages I've never seen before.  Some I could figure out.  But others, I'm like, what the fuck is that?  And what, where do you get that keyboard so you can even type that?  You know?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Look at the TV.  Jesus.  It's, uh, it's just flattened people. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  They'll be all right.  The ones that, uh, survived.  They'll be all right.  All right.  So Mustard, I'm back.  The human spirit.  They'll be all right.  I just went away.  I was looking at a flattened building.  Yeah.  No, it's, uh, that's, that's, that's what happens down there.  Um, so then Mustard plays some other songs.  And every song we put online, people are just eating up.  And I, uh, I, I, I told Mustard that I need to help him, uh, produce an album.  So it's going down.  We just got to figure it out.  I think we got a guy in Brooklyn that's going to give us studio time, which is very, very 
[01:00:30]  nice, uh, of him.  And, uh, we just got to figure out.  I don't know.  I don't know the first thing about this shit.  That's the problem.  But I know I just got to help this guy.  I don't know why.  It's the needy, the, the, the side of me that, uh, just helps people.  That is ridiculous that most people don't know about, which is nice.  Um, but what do we do?  I don't know.  Do we do a five, six song fucking CD?  And then where do we put it?  So the Mustard guy can make some money off it.  iTunes.  Just iTunes it?  Sure.  And that's it? 
[01:01:00]  Well, I mean, that's the way to do it.  It's the easiest way.  Cause where's, you know, you can just go grab it.  All right, cool.  Do I get a piece of the action?  I would take 80%.  I'd give Mustard 20?  Not even.  That's the taxes.  Well, let's bring Mustard in here.  Let's rob him blind.  Uh, homeless Mustard and making, I think his third appearance on the radio show.  He helped us out right before vacation.  So we haven't seen him in almost a month now.  There he is. 
[01:01:30]  Mustard.  Yo.  Hey.  What's up, brother?  Hello, everybody.  I did write you back, by the way.  I mean, for a homeless guy, he's pretty connected.  I mean, he's got a Facebook, a MySpace.  He's got an email address.  Oh, they love me on Facebook, man.  They love me on Facebook.  Yeah.  Where do you check your email?  At the library?  Apple Store, mostly.  No, the librarians have gotten really uptight about it.  Because, okay, cause I don't have, I can't get a library card cause I don't have an,  I don't have an address.  Right.  Without an address you can get a library card.  So you go and you ask for a guest pass.  And a guest pass is for someone who's visiting, right? 
[01:02:00]  And so they'll give you a guest pass the first couple times, but then they start to  see you more than once or twice and they go, no, you can't have a guest pass anymore.  So the libraries in my neighborhood will no longer give me a guest pass.  Wait, really?  It's that hard to get a library card?  I know, right?  Why?  Cause you need an address.  Well, that's a loophole.  They just don't want homeless people in their libraries.  Basically.  Hanging around and sleeping and, you know, sweating up the joint. 
[01:02:30]  How's the Apple Store?  They're pretty cool, right?  Uh, sometimes.  Uh, some of the Apple people, Apple people, as we call them, the Apple people, um, some  of them are cool.  Some of them like love it.  They think we're groovy as shit and they're like, whatever, do what you want to do.  Every once in a while you have some, some uptight prick come over and go, um, uh, there's  only, there's a 20 minute limit.  There's a 20 minute, uh, uh, you have to go now.  You know, so we'll go upstairs and play the kiddie video games, but, um, the one on, there's  one on Prince Street and there's one on 10th Avenue and the one on 10th Avenue, they're 
[01:03:00]  much more chill there than the one on Prince Street.  Right.  10th Avenue.  10th Avenue and like 14th.  Yeah.  And meatpacking.  Oh, sure.  Oh yeah.  It's 9th Avenue, right?  No?  Yeah.  9th Avenue in the corner.  Okay.  And then how about the one on 5th Avenue, the 24 hour one?  What?  That's all.  He's downtown, man.  Oh, okay.  That's uptown shit.  You mean the one that's way uptown by Central Park?  Yeah.  We don't go that, we don't go that far uptown.  Yeah.  You're not into it, right?  Hey, so.  I've been there, but I. 
[01:03:30]  So the last time we had you in was for that, uh, that homeless thing we were doing, which  was just crazy.  So we couldn't really talk to you.  I mean, uh, tell us what's going on as far as, you know, the videos and stuff.  What, what, what has gotten back to you?  I mean, you gotta be amazed by.  I am.  By the love out there.  Oh, the, the, the, the response has been amazing.  It's, um, I've been, I, you know, I'm every day I go to the, we go back and forth between  the two Apple, the one on Prince street and the one on, uh, 14th street.  We go back and forth between these Apple stores and I'm chatting with people all day long from 
[01:04:00]  all over the world.  It's tripping me out from Istanbul, from Madrid, uh, Australia, Russia.  I think some of those, uh, Russian fucking places.  I don't know.  Is it a country still?  Perhaps.  Isn't it all broken up?  I don't know.  People all over the world, all over the world.  They're very, Poland.  Oh, they love me in Poland.  That's right.  They love me in Poland.  What's your Facebook name?  Daniel Mustard.  Daniel Mustard.  Okay.  That's my name.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  You got a lot.  Where's Anthony?  He's, uh, he's sick today.  Anthony's ill.  Yeah.  Anthony's ill.  Yeah.  That's unfortunate.  So.  He was gagged with a giant penis.  Well, you know.  Sometimes.  It happens, right?  Yeah.  Sometimes.  It happens.  Anthony calls in a lot with ripped anal tissue.  I should have quit at one.  All right.  Well.  He just stared at you.  I'm just saying.  It happens.  And I'm getting.  I know.  Chip.  And Mustard, I'm getting email from all over the world, too. 
[01:05:00]  And people want to book you in other countries.  Yeah.  I've had.  I've had.  I don't know.  I don't know what that's about.  I don't know if they want to get you into the slave trade or something.  There's some radio station in Paris that wants me to fly me out.  Wants to fly me out there.  All right.  Interview me and all nine.  Now, the big question.  You wrote me the other day and said that you're sober.  I was sober.  I was sober for about nine days.  Last night, I had to drink.  And this morning, I've been drinking, too. 
[01:05:30]  I don't know what to say.  You know, like, there's this idea that, okay, sobriety.  What is sobriety?  It's interesting to me.  Okay.  As far as the communication I've gotten on the internet, more than anything else, people  have been talking to me about alcoholism.  More than anything else.  More than music.  More than all the rest of this.  People have been talking about what it means to be an alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  Yes, I'm an alcoholic.  Hello.  Hi.  Not very anonymous, but I am an alcoholic. 
[01:06:00]  In AA, the concept is never, never, never, never, never, never.  And I feel like the more you tell somebody that you can never have something, the more  you want it.  So I feel like, I don't know.  I need to learn moderation.  That's a Buddhist concept.  All things are moderation.  I would say one thing, not AA or any other program name related, just say, let's just  say the concept of never.  I quit drinking many years ago, but I was never, for me, the concept of never wasn't good.  It was just a day.  That's what a day at a time means.  One day at a time, yeah.  I would just not do it today.  Yeah, I don't look at anything forever. 
[01:06:30]  I can't not do anything forever.  Just today, you know, that's it.  One day I can handle.  And I have.  I do that.  Okay, today, all right, no.  Today, all right, no.  Today, all right, no.  But last night, or this morning, it was really this morning, I was like, all right, whatever.  I don't know.  I didn't want to, to be honest, I didn't want to come here sober.  Well, you get the shakes and all that crap real bad, too, if you're not drinking.  No, I'm over, I think I'm over that, because I don't drink as often as I used to, but. 
[01:07:00]  Well, where do you want to be down the road?  I mean, because obviously, you know what you're doing with that fucking guitar.  So don't you want to, don't you want some kind of career with that, or?  Yeah, of course, of course.  Is the alcohol getting in your way?  What's getting in your way?  Or you could hit me over the head with a guitar.  I don't know what's getting in my way.  I mean, you told your story a little bit to us, how you had some tragedies in your life  that kind of sent you down this road, right? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the alcohol really is a symptom of the situation, not the cause.  You know, that's, we go to AAO, because the alcohol killed you.  I was like, you know what, I was sober when all this shit went down.  It wasn't until I was on the streets that I was drinking like this.  And people don't want, they don't want to hear that, though.  People don't want to hear that.  They want to think that the alcohol is the reason, and really it's a symptom of, you 
[01:08:00]  know, the situation.  Right, right.  It's really hard to live on the streets sober.  Right.  You know, it really is.  Right, right.  Well, we were talking on the way over here, and he, like you were saying, you booked, you  came here for gigs, like you did stuff when you got here.  Oh, no, I booked some gigs.  The reason I, even the covers I do know, like The Boys Don't Cry and all that, and Oasis,  and, um, the reason I even know those songs is because when I first got here, um, I was  immediately, I booked a bunch of gigs, you know, right when I first got here, I played 
[01:08:30]  a bunch of places, including a show with Lady Gaga.  Stephanie, hello, hi.  The great Lady Gaga.  Do you know her personally?  Yes, yes, I do, actually.  I guess I do.  Hey, what's going on in her pants, you think?  She got a, I've seen a pussy.  She got a pussy.  I don't know what y'all, I've seen it.  I've seen it. 
[01:09:00]  What?  It's a bar called The Dark Room.  It's on Ludlow, Lower East Side.  Sitting in the, she, she pulled her shit down.  She hopped up on the sink.  She's pissing in the sink.  Me and my friend Jeremy, he's a drummer.  Does she have a big vagina?  A big, what does that mean exactly?  Like a large clit?  Like meaty.  I don't know.  I didn't actually investigate her clit.  Oh, I mean, you're not.  The point is, she got a pussy.  All right, she ain't got no dick.  I don't know what y'all talking about.  I've seen it, I've seen it, I've seen it. 
[01:09:30]  I love it.  I've seen it.  So, when you first moved to New York, what was the buzz on your music?  Was there any buzz?  Yeah, I guess, yeah, probably.  Did you get close to being signed?  Yeah, well, no, I don't know.  People, you know, people talk, people talk, people talk, people talk.  I got a lot of that.  I don't know, we can do this, I can do this, I can do this.  Because you can make some money off this CD that we're going to make for you.  I hope so.  And then what are you going to do with the money? 
[01:10:00]  If I find myself a home.  Do you want to be off the street?  Yeah.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, I do.  Frequently asked questions.  Yes.  Am I really homeless?  Yes, I'm really homeless.  Is my name really mustard?  Yes, my name is really mustard.  Was I really born on Christmas?  Yes, I was really born on Christmas.  That Taylor, is this the same guitar?  Yes, it is.  No, there's another one.  No, neither of these guitars are mine.  I do not have a guitar.  So, you're being asked the same exact shit I am.  Over and over and over.  You can't figure out that he might have gotten the guitar from Sirius XM that has over, what, 
[01:10:30]  two, three hundred fucking channels and his musicians come in all the time to play.  What, the homeless guy with a Taylor?  I'm like, uh, it's not my name.  Every radio station in America has some kind of guitar laying around in case the artist  that comes in for the interview feels like playing.  Playing the guitar.  But, whatever.  So, all right.  Any other questions, Jimmy?  No, I mean, I just think getting sober is the only way you're going to get out of this.  It's a mess. 
[01:11:00]  I know, yeah.  There's no other way.  I'm working on it.  You know, today is my break.  Today, I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little, I just want to laugh along with mustard today.  I got some good sober days.  Sober days are interesting because you see things differently than you do when you're drunk.  But sometimes you don't want to see those things.  So you want to get a little, a little toasted.  Yeah.  How are you going to deal with the, what's going on in the head?  Say what?  The, the mental stuff.  What about it?  Well, how are you going to deal with that? 
[01:11:30]  I don't know yet.  Uh, how do they deal with it?  They give you drugs.  Yeah.  I'd rather get drunk than take their drugs, to be honest.  Mm-hmm.  What about therapy and all that crap?  I would love some therapy.  Thank you very much.  Can I have some?  Or is it?  I don't know if I can pay.  I don't know if I can pay for therapy, too, mustard.  I fucking like this mustard guy.  I fucking like this mustard guy.  So what do you want to do today for us, mustard?  You probably have some kind of plan.  We didn't even know you were coming in until yesterday, so. 
[01:12:00]  Uh, you got another cover or something you want to play?  Uh, okay, yeah.  I do have a cover, but where's, oh, I lost my paper.  I think I left it outside.  It's over there.  Um, I have a cover to do, which is fun.  And I have an original I want, a couple of originals I wanted to do.  It's, it's hard because, you know, because I don't have a guitar, so I can't, like, practice  or rehearse, you know what I mean?  Yeah, that's the other thing people are saying.  They're like, you're trying to tell me that the guy hasn't played, and all of a sudden  he just picks up this guitar and gets that version of Creep out there. 
[01:12:30]  And I'm like, yeah, that's exactly how it went down.  Thank you, yes.  That's exactly how it went down, yeah.  Um, I don't have a guitar, so it's hard for me to, like, I can't practice, but I think  Well, and you know what?  We learned, mustard, hold on, before you start, we've learned from the past, we've had, um,  homeless guys come in that, you know, we've bought guitars for homeless people before,  and we've learned that they last maybe two days out there on the streets.  No, it's hard.  It's hard to keep a guitar on the streets.  It's because either the homeless guy is having an episode and smashes it, or it's just being 
[01:13:00]  stolen, so another homeless guy could buy booze.  Yeah.  No, when I bought my-  That's the only reason we have an offer to buy you a guitar, because we just know it's  not going to last out there.  When I got my first guitar, my first guitar was a classical guitar that my sister's boyfriend  left in the closet in my mother's house and whatever.  But when I got, like, my first guitar, it was, um, uh, Takamini, uh, $1,000, just spent  $1,000 on this fucker.  Uh, I thought it was, I thought it would be the only guitar I'd ever have in my life. 
[01:13:30]  I thought that would be it, you know what I mean?  I thought I would have this guitar until the rest of my life.  I've been through 50 fucking guitars since then, and that's only, like, three years ago.  No kidding.  Not even that long ago.  Uh, I've run through so many guitars.  I've beat guitars over people's heads.  I have been beaten over the head by guitars.  I have seen guitars go in many horrible ways.  All right, well, why don't you play something for us today?  All right, all right.  Here's Mustard, everyone.  This is, okay, this is all right.  This is mine.  This is everything.  I didn't do, oh, fuck. 
[01:14:00]  All right, let's try this over. 
[01:14:30]  How did I just...  All right, let's do this.  I forgot it.  Let's do this inside.  So, baby, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Let's do this again.  Uh-oh.  I know, right?  No, yeah.  No, seriously.  Seriously.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  That's a good question.  Hello.  Uh-oh.  Oh, wait.  Are we still in the air?  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Can we at least have fun with it at least? 
[01:15:30]  Wait, what's going...  Hold on, Lester.  What's going on right now?  Out in the sun.  Under the benches.  Wait.  Wait, fuck.  Out in the...  This is perfect.  Under the...  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  This is how it was supposed to end.  This is how it was supposed to end.  No, it's not.  Are you still getting the word?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is...  I've been sober for like 10 days. 
[01:16:00]  And then last night and this morning, I've been drinking.  Fuck that.  And so I'm like, uh...  I'm a little tweaked out.  Fuck that Hollywood ending shit.  This is how it's supposed to end.  No, don't say that.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  This could be so much better than all this.  Come on.  Come on.  I can do better than this.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Uh-oh.  Add in the trenches.  Down in the grime.  Under the benches.  Where you find all my intentions.  Good as they might. 
[01:16:30]  Try to mention.  I, I, they might.  But now we're standing.  No, no.  Standing too close.  Don't you know, baby?  You're the one I love the most.  This shit, it happen all the time.  Out in the trench.  Down in the grime.  And I've been four dead.  Been dead back twice.  All the remote.  That's the truth.  And if you told me, maybe. 
[01:17:00]  It's some advice.  I might not devote to that.  So fucking say.  Get, get.  All this shit, I'm crying.  Out in the trench.  Down in the grime.  And if you called me.  And if you called me.  And if you told me.  Something to sell.  A big band of gold juice.  Left in the hall. 
[01:17:30]  Talked it.  Like a spoo.  Out in the trenches.  Down in the grime.  Never surrender.  Never rewind.  All jacked come full shot.  Live on delights.  At that side.  What else did you expect to find?  Out in the trench.  Down in the grime. 
[01:18:00]  What else did you expect to find?  Out in the trenches.  Down in the grime.  It's funny.  It's funny.  When I get tanked.  The guitar.  I lose the guitar.  The guitar kind of goes away from me.  I'm not really a guitar player.  I have a guitar player.  He was supposed to come with me. 
[01:18:30]  But we couldn't get him in.  What happened to the guitar player?  They wouldn't let him in.  Dude.  Do you realize you're my ticket to Easy Street?  You can't fuck this up, man.  Easy S.J.  No.  Fuck.  He takes your leg.  I can sing for days.  The fucking wheels are falling off.  I can sing for days.  I need somebody else to play the guitar.  That's the point.  Keith.  What were you saying?  Keith had information.  Just don't make me play the guitar.  I don't want to play the guitar anymore.  When I showed up this morning.  They were camped out in front of the precinct. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Probably would get me fired.  But what's the fellow's name?  The other guy's name.  Lutus.  Lutus Massilian.  Lutus Massilian and Joel Young.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's saying good luck.  Go.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Lutus was supposed to.  We didn't know he was showing up.  And then there's issues with the building with trying to get people in.  They have to have advanced notice and provide the right people.  I mean, we came through the front door today, which was nice.  Yeah.  That was nice.  I thought I just made it.  It's nice that the building at least treated you like a human being today.  Yeah, right?  Instead of going up the freight elevator with the fucking cabbage. 
[01:19:30]  But next time, we're going to bring Lutus with us.  Who's Lutus?  Lutus is my guru.  Lutus Rules?  He's the person I've learned more about guitar playing from him than anybody tells us.  Sam, what are you thinking?  Do the wheels just fall off?  Yeah.  Every time we get Mustard in, we're thinking, all right, this is going to be our next 600,000  hit YouTube video.  Fuck that.  I'm starting to see dollar signs.  You don't think I'm going to get myself a little taste?  Not anymore. 
[01:20:00]  Not anymore.  Mustard, I'm just fucking with you.  I'm still Team Mustard.  Uh-oh.  You're right?  That's fine.  I was just kidding, too.  Yeah, we're just fucking around.  We're just-  No, whatever.  You're hurting Mustard's feelings.  No, no, no, no.  This is what you do.  I understand.  This is the show.  This is the point.  Sorry.  What were you going to play in the beginning there?  I don't remember.  Oh, there's a fucking Britney song.  See, I don't have a guitar, so I can't practice.  How about we take a break and you can practice a little bit? 
[01:20:30]  Okay.  Is that cool?  Okay.  And then we bring you back in?  Okay.  You're not mad at me, are you?  No.  Why are you mad at us?  We're still going to-  Why are you mad at us?  You guys are so insecure.  Here's the thing.  I am mad at nobody.  You can see right through us.  I'm just glad to be here.  So just shut the fuck up.  All right, so we have Nick coming in.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and get Nick DePaolo in and you do a little practicing  and, you know, we'll get something going.  Hopefully.  Oh, please. 
[01:21:00]  What kind of CD do you want to make, by the way?  Originals?  Are we allowed to put covers up on iTunes?  I've got to get in touch with Tom York.  I've got to find that man.  Tom York?  A lot of Radiohead fans have been trying to show him the video.  I could build a career off of that, just doing the cover of that song.  Yeah, I don't know if it's on his radar or not, but, oh my God, if we could put that  version of Creep out there.  Oh, shit, you'd make some cake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I'm all right with that.  Are we on break now?  What's going on?  Let's go eat your sausage and mayonnaise sandwich.  Are we still on air?  Yeah, we are.  Hold on.  Oh, damn it.  Hold on.  I just want to play this for everybody out there.  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  Something happened.  All right.  Well, you practice.  Don't get Nick in. 
[01:22:00]  It was gone silly.  No, we're going to, you're going to come back and you're going to freaking bring the  house down with, with, uh, I want to hear that Britney Spears thing.  You keep talking about that. 
[01:22:30]  Wait, are we still on air?  I thought we were going to rake.  All right.  I figured it out.  We got to make believe we're not on the air.  We're going to get some good shit out of them.  I just got to figure you out.  That's all.  What?  He's a challenge. 
[01:23:00]  I got it.  I got to be honest.  So, baby, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?  Nah, I fucked it up.  So, baby, baby, baby.  This is perfect.  Like, you know, Anthony said that we would get him in the studio and he would turn into 
[01:23:30]  the Warner Brothers cartoon frog.  That's exactly what is going down today.  Mustard, go practice because we got to take a break.  I know.  Give me a break.  You said.  You said you're going to break.  I'm still team Mustard.  Come on.  Come on.  For the record, I'm still team Mustard.  Give me a second, man.  You know, last time I held a guitar, uh, last time I was here.  Um, hello.  Hi.  All right.  I don't have a guitar.  I cannot practice.  I cannot rehearse.  Maybe I'll give you a little, uh, you know, a little, uh.  No, I've got enough of that.  There's enough of that going on.  I just need a fucking minute to fucking play this song. 
[01:24:00]  I used to play this song for, for all day fucking long.  Just go.  We will have you back in though.  We got to take a break for real.  Yeah.  Take a break.  Our homeless friend Mustard is in the house.  Nick DiPaolo joins the program next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony starring Jim Norton today.  Check it out. 
[01:24:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ant's out today.  We got Jim Norton.  Of course.  We got Nick DiPaolo.  And we got Mustard trying to figure it out outside the damn studio.  And Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Bravo to you, uh, today, sir.  He writes, Opie's dreams of managing a star are collapsing like a Haitian village. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, come on.  I have relatives over there.  Stephen S. also writes, homeless and now songless.  That's terrific.  That's just terrific.  What happened there, Jimmy?  I don't know.  He just got a little nervous, I think.  What were you thinking when he was going down?  Did you have an uh-oh moment?  No, I wasn't surprised.  I mean, Nick goes to the bathroom outdoors.  It's kind of, you know, I'm not surprised that his guitar skills are waning.  You know, it's tough.  He couldn't remember what he wanted to say. 
[01:25:30]  I was so happy because that story's right, right?  That's how, there's nothing that happened.  What?  We got to say hi to Nick.  Nick DiPaolo's here.  Good morning to Nick DiPaolo.  And we were in Houston, where, you know, and the guy who picked us up said that Nick,  you stayed in a place, and something about, nothing happened.  It was just that Nick was in his towel or half naked.  I ordered room service.  Oh.  Yeah, I ordered room service, and they said a half hour.  So I get in the shower, and not even like 14 minutes later, for the first time in my life,  somebody's knocking on me. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  So I open the door, and it's like this 22-year-old smoking, like Russian.  I mean, smile.  And I'm in my towel, and she's not even like being shy.  She's kind of like looking at me with a smirk on her face.  Yeah.  And I was just saying, what do you do?  Jimmy, what do you do?  I mean, I can't do it.  I'm married, but I don't know what you're doing.  The guy told us that story.  He goes, yeah, that was kind of cool.  And I just said, ah, it's bullshit.  He tells that story in every city.  There's always a Russian girl.  And he's like, really?  He's like, I believed him. 
[01:26:30]  I'm like, yeah, he was just lying.  So me and Kenny, for no reason, just made up the fact that we pretended that you lied  and you threw you under the bus.  It's like it was this story you make up.  No.  And it's always, I've been doing it on the road 20 years.  It's always like a 65-year-old Mexican guy brings my food.  Sure, yeah.  What do I do?  Never a hot, young.  Used to be a Haitian guy, you know.  I'll tell you what I do.  Used to be a Russian stripper.  I take my finger, and I crook it, and I unhook it.  And I go, whoops-a-daisy.  Sorry about that. 
[01:27:00]  I thought this story was going to end that Nick is the guy that orders room service or  waits for the maid, and he's naked on the bench, jerking off.  There's another comic who said that.  When the maid goes, he goes, finally.  It's a fucking, whatever comedian goes, yeah, I was naked, and the maid walked in.  Yeah.  Finally.  That's such a great joke.  But there are guys that actually do that.  And Danny was showing us the videos, a montage of maids walking in as the guy's jerking  off.  But the guy sets it up ahead of time.  It's his thing.  He gets turned on by this fucking... 
[01:27:30]  I thought you were going to be one of those guys.  No.  No.  I just like saying that Nick made it up, because it was such a thing that you wouldn't make  up unless you were a fucking psychopath.  Yeah, no.  You know, and it's funny, because on stage, I'd ask, I'd go, girls, will you know, of course  when I'm on my...  I go, well, girls, what's happened?  And all these are girls in the audience, they're like, you should have dropped your time!  Yeah, yeah.  And then you would have been, you know, lawsuit, rape, divorce.  Thanks for your help.  Or maybe just a quiet blowjob.  See, I don't have those instincts anymore.  Well, I do, but I have to hide them. 
[01:28:00]  But, uh, I can't lose a house.  I told Nick just before he came on air with us, and Puddle of AIDS is saying the same  thing.  Nick was fucking awesome filling in for Dan Patrick.  It would be highly advisable to get him his own show on the virus, lunch or dinner show.  Yeah, that would be nice if they would pay someone else around here.  They pay one guy, and everyone else has to kind of fight for the scraps.  Because we have all the guys that could fill this channel with some fine programming, but  they just don't want to pay anybody.  That's true, isn't it?  They just don't want to pay nobody. 
[01:28:30]  Who's Dan Patrick, and where'd you fill in for him?  I know the name.  Yeah, I know the name of it.  Well, he's a sports center guy for years.  Oh, he's a sports center?  I thought so, okay.  Yeah, and then he left for his own thing.  Does he do a good show?  I don't even know.  Yeah, actually.  He does a pretty good show?  He's got like three or four young guys, you know, like sports fanatics.  First of all, the studio's in a small town in Connecticut, right?  It's like a man, they had that man cave company come to this, you know, that'll redo you.  And they said, yeah.  They'll redo your basement.  So I go in there.  It really is.  It's like a man's paradise.  It's an actual bar, working bar. 
[01:29:00]  There's beautiful leather furniture, exposed brick, flat screen TVs everywhere.  It's like huge.  It's like three of these with a glass partition in the middle, and the three or four producers  are on the other side of the glass.  And there's memorabilia, you know, pictures of him with everybody.  Wow.  But it's like, what a place to go to work, you know?  It's not a bad idea.  We should have them do something with this piece of shit.  In man cave, it'll be a gaping asshole they'll turn this place into.  One big glory hole.  It was fun to be, you know, talking sports. 
[01:29:30]  For how long did you do it?  Two days, I've still been from.  How many hours?  Three.  Oh, that's nice.  No, it was beautiful.  Three hours is perfect.  And with guys chiming in, which is...  It goes fast.  Like, if we had a three-hour show, we'd almost be done, Nick.  It's a four-and-a-half, five-hour show.  Is that what you're doing?  Well, six to ten-thirty.  Yeah, but we cheat here and there, you know.  I hope so.  Yeah.  We sneak a little here and there.  The quality is finished by eight.  Oh, yeah.  Two-and-a-half of filler. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of them.  So, what's the temperature?  What do you think of McGuire speaking sports, Nick?  I hate him even more now.  First, you're a liar.  Now, you're a fucking crybaby.  Six-foot-five, 280 pounds of sniffing.  There was no time.  Now, I can't, you know.  He made me sick in front of the Congress when he, you know, testified.  I only want to look forward.  But that was, what's stupid.  See how privileged he thought he was?  Now, you cry in front of you.  Will you stop with that shit? 
[01:30:30]  You're literally like a little kid crying because you want to get something.  You want to be in the hall of fame.  Yeah, exactly.  It's fucking shameless.  He's trying to protect his image, I understand.  But at least, don't cry.  What image?  Don't cry on us.  Well, the image is being ruined by the day.  We were talking about the steroid thing the other day.  And they keep saying Tony La Russa didn't know.  It's like, come on.  The manager of the team that's probably obsessive about everything doesn't realize his guys are  getting bigger and bigger and their stats are getting better and better.  Yeah, McGuire's got zits on his back like Frisbees. 
[01:31:00]  He doesn't see him in the locker room.  Oh, and what's that fucking hubcap mark on your neck?  He's got what looks like hives all over his body, but that's not hives.  Especially an over-manager like Tony La Russa.  Lefty, lefty!  Righty, righty!  The stats say I should put lefty left me!  Got it!  He's a lawyer.  He's a fucking liar.  Is he really a lawyer?  Is he a lawyer?  He's a lawyer and he's a fucking PETA.  One of those PETA left-wing animal-loving...  A great baseball guy.  What happened?  You turned off your own mic, Nick. 
[01:31:30]  You alright?  No, there's buttons.  There's buttons under your shit.  I say buttons.  Alright, I got your back on.  Buttons.  You're a pit and things.  What is this?  Who designed this?  Who put that there?  I told you to put the buttons where they're not going to fall.  Get away from my kids!  Jake!  Look, things could be worse.  He could be in Haiti right now.  You know what?  Someone came up with a pretty good idea on the phones the other day.  They said every team should have one guy they designate to juice.  That's not a bad idea.  To be on the stirruge. 
[01:32:00]  Kind of like, are you a hockey fan or not really?  I used to love it.  Not as much anymore.  Because it's getting kind of...  What, girly?  Yeah, kind of girly.  A long time ago.  Long time ago.  Kind of girly.  But every team used to have an enforcer.  Yeah.  So Major League Baseball have one guy that just juices and gets as big as he possibly can.  And it's legal.  But the kids, Opie.  The kids.  The kids.  Well, that's what I'm talking about.  That's the times we're living in, man.  And it fucking envelops everything.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  No, I got the nephews playing the sports.  And I don't...  You know, whatever. 
[01:32:30]  Huh?  Your kids...  No, I mean, I don't care.  I mean, if they're going to, you know, make us pay so much money to see these sporting  events, you want to see some monsters out there, right?  Look, as far as football goes, they should be mandatory juicing.  Well...  I like them...  Come on.  Football, fast, violent.  The faster, the bigger, the more violent.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The hits are getting fucking uglier and uglier, man.  Good.  That's how it should be.  Who do you want to win the Super Bowl?  It doesn't matter anymore.  I know.  Are you...  You're not a big Patriots fan.  Of course I am.  I grew up in the 70s watching when they stunk, and, uh... 
[01:33:00]  Are they done?  The dynasty is officially over?  No, that's baloney.  The way you fucking play is change teams, you know, every year.  That's...  You're never on it.  Don't you hate people that can't give good examples?  They change teams when most people change the hat bands.  What?  Hat bands.  Guys that get overexcited just can't come up with the example.  Yeah, like breakfast coffee.  Why does Belichick wear the pom-pom? 
[01:33:30]  That...  The winter hat with the pom-pom.  And the old...  It had the old emblem on it.  I see that.  The old Patriots.  The guy hiking the ball.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when they really sucked.  They were bending them.  But, uh, who's gonna...  I don't know.  I think you're gonna see, uh...  I think you're gonna see, uh...  Jets?  No.  I think, uh, Indianapolis, uh...  You can't push for my Jets just a little bit?  No, I'm...  I kinda like the Jets.  Indianapolis and Minnesota.  I wanna see Dallas Jets.  Dallas Jets.  Oh, what a great matchup of that.  I'd love to see that. 
[01:34:00]  That would be, uh...  If it was 1974.  Yeah.  Did you go to the Winter Classic?  Someone's saying you did.  No, I didn't.  Oh, you didn't?  I couldn't.  Where was I?  But, uh...  That looked fucking great.  Fuck yeah, I wanted to go.  The company just ignored my request.  They have hockey here, too.  And they wouldn't get you a ticket for the Winter Classic?  I don't know.  Oh, they never even acknowledged that I, you know, wanted to go.  It's not looking good for renegotiations.  No, not at all.  Not looking good. 
[01:34:30]  Your boy.  Huh?  Oh, Jay, yeah, man.  What do you think of the late night wars?  I think Zucker is a fucking douche.  And he's, uh...  Letterman took Zucker.  I mean, you know, how loyal Jay was to NBC, and they just do that to him?  When he was number one, you mean pulling him out?  Yeah.  But that, I mean, to get the Tonight Show in the first place, all the affiliates...  He used to, you know, travel all over the country, you know, meet with the affiliates,  all of it.  He couldn't have been more loyal to that company, and then they shit on him like that. 
[01:35:00]  What, Jay?  Yeah, Jay.  The original shitting on we're talking about?  Yeah, because now everyone's like...  I mean, Jay's sort of looking like a bad guy with some of the stuff I'm reading.  And it's like, Jay, you know...  Jay got fucked to begin with.  Because people don't know what they're talking about.  They think that Jay quit, and now is trying to take it back, and he didn't.  That's what's driving me nuts.  NBC kind of fucked him, and he was a trooper and stayed there.  And I personally believe that he stayed...  Instead of going to ABC, where he could have made a shitload of cash, too, believe me,  he could have went there. 
[01:35:30]  He stayed loyal to the network.  And I also think, in the back of his mind, he had to think, what if Conan didn't work out?  He'd be the guy they'd go back to.  He had to at least think that.  But now, you know, it looks like people...  Anyone that thinks that Jay is fucking Conan, you're a dummy.  If you think the network's fucking Conan, that's fine.  But if you think Jay's doing it, you're a dummy.  Yeah, how does that get twisted?  And I was watching Letterman last night, and he was sort of implying that, too,  that Jay was, like, sabotaging.  Although I did love Letterman was ripping Zucker to shreds. 
[01:36:00]  He's the one who, you know, when Colin did the original tough crowd, he did it on NBC.  He put the kibosh on it.  Yeah, I remember that.  He's got the magic touch, doesn't he?  What, he wasn't a fan of the show, obviously?  He was at the taping, and no, he liked it.  He actually thought it was very funny.  But he thought it was too edgy for the network.  I remember, I know it was Zucker, too.  Yeah, wrong call again.  That would have worked.  I think so, too.  So would have worked.  So, yeah, you know, Christ, that just goes to show you, man, it's all like, it comes  down to one guy's opinion of what he likes, what's funny, you know? 
[01:36:30]  Zucker maybe really loved what Conan was doing or whatever, that's why.  Yeah.  I know they want that Democrat, but Jay was number one when they gave him the boot, was  he not?  Dude, he beat Letterman without writers, and that's not a knock on Letterman.  It's just a matter of, Letterman was just doing fucking, he's a beast.  He's unbeatable at that hour, or at least he has been for years.  And they pull him.  And, again, the advantage of the Tonight Show being in Hollywood, you get the better  guess.  Sure.  But, yeah, I mean, come on. 
[01:37:00]  Jay is perfect for that stuff.  Here's the question.  When Leno goes back to 1130, will he be as effective?  Yeah, he will.  I think it's going to go right back to where it was.  Yeah, it might have gone long enough.  It'll go right back to where it was.  Because it was so short.  Yeah.  If it was a year or a year and a half, it may have damaged Jay, or it might have damaged  the Tonight Show name.  But I think now, it will, people, like, don't forget, in a year, people will look back,  oh, yeah, remember that four months, then two years.  It's just distant memory.  I think so.  So what do you think Conan's going to go?  Where is he going to go?  I don't know.  How is Conan going to go to Fox and demand big money, where they saw that he was having 
[01:37:30]  trouble beating Letterman, and now he's got Leno and Letterman?  How does Conan go and justify big money so well?  I don't know.  With all the attention Conan's getting, Letterman's still kicking his butt.  Is he still beating him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he is.  But they kept saying Conan still had that young demographic, those numbers that, that's  why Fox is still interested.  Oh, okay, yeah.  So, I don't know.  I don't know how it plays out.  I never met Conan.  Everybody says he's a nice dude.  He is.  He's a great guy, Conan.  I just didn't like the people working for him, because I was doing panel on Leno, and  they wouldn't give me a date to do stand-up on Conan. 
[01:38:00]  That's how it is.  I know.  It's bizarre, man.  I would have showed him the set after, like, with Eddie for Letterman.  They gave me a date, and then Eddie came to the club, but it was just a matter of, I'm  not going to fucking audition for you, but that one guy who worked for him had such a  dislike of me.  That's what I'm talking about.  It was very frustrating.  Make it personal.  We got John in Jersey.  John?  Hey, good morning, boy.  Good morning, John.  Hey.  I just want to say, Jimmy, I think you're missing the point with this whole, you know, Leno  was number one, and they got rid of him.  I don't think that matters in the end, because really, what NBC was doing is saying, all 
[01:38:30]  right, we're going to make a move for the future at this point in time.  They're saying, all right, five years from now, Conan.  And how'd that work out?  It's like Green Bay with Brett Favre.  That is what they said, dude.  They did say we're going to make a move for the future.  You're right.  But the thing is, they miscalculated.  There's something wrong with it if you miscalculate.  And they miscalculated Jay's effectiveness five years down the road.  They underestimated his effectiveness, and that was a terrible miscalculation.  They look at the...  No, Jimmy.  Dude, look at how it's working out. 
[01:39:00]  Look at how it's working out.  Look at the Brett Favre situation in Green Bay.  It's exactly the same thing.  No, it's not.  Brett Favre is not funny.  Yeah, Brett Favre, you killed...  Brett Favre is not funny, fella.  All right, do what he's saying.  This guy's obviously a Conan guy.  Go ahead, go.  Yeah, but when Favre said he wanted to come back right before he went to the Jets, he was  still playing at a high level at that point.  But Green Bay said, look, I know you want to come back.  I know you're talented.  I know you're still playing at a high level.  But we have this guy waiting in the wings, who's been waiting for a few years now. 
[01:39:30]  And they're out of the playoffs, and Brett Favre's in the playoffs.  Right.  So you thought that it was the right move?  But was Brett Favre winning the actual Super Bowl?  Jay Leno was number one when they kicked him to the curb.  They were looking at Jay's personal age and going, in five years, it's going to be unappealing.  The ratings aren't going to be as good.  This is a young man's game, but they don't realize the shit that goes into it.  And there's a lot more fucking longevity in late-night hosting than there is in physical  sport like football.  So you're obviously a Conan guy.  You think it was the right move for them to go.  And I'm telling you, they didn't anticipate that Jay would be number one. 
[01:40:00]  I don't dislike Jay.  I don't dislike Jay.  But I also think that...  How am I missing the point?  Because I just think the fact that he was number one doesn't matter.  I mean, because ultimately, if they're making a move, because if they're making a move for  the future, then they're obviously going to be number one.  This isn't sports.  You're making a sports analogy.  It doesn't work.  They're making a move for the future, but let's just say Jay had gone to ABC, and Conan 
[01:40:30]  had taken the Tonight Show, and Jay had said, fuck you, I went to ABC.  The move to the future, Conan is not going to be beating Jay.  Because they thought that they let...  You know, I just completely lost my thought.  He would not have been beating Jay, or they wouldn't have kept Jay, but they saw...  I think Conan was having trouble with Ferguson.  I think Craig Ferguson was beating Conan.  Explain that one to me.  I've heard that.  I could be wrong.  But I think that they started to see that, although Conan's a very niche guy, and he  might be a very specific humor that maybe won't appeal to the numbers that Jay will. 
[01:41:00]  I also have to think...  I also think you have to look at why Jay was number one, because when Jay first took  over the Tonight Show, he wasn't number one for a while.  Three years.  He had this whole Hugh Grant thing, and then all of a sudden, you know, people are attracted  to scandal.  Well, Conan comes on in June.  All of a sudden, Letterman's got this national news-grabbing scandal with him and his affair  that he's talking about on air, and all of a sudden, that's going to attract viewers to  Letterman.  And then, I just don't think that Conan was able to recover from that, plus the fact that  they put crappy prime time... 
[01:41:30]  Dude, you're making...  Dude, I know what you're doing.  You're making excuses for the fact that Conan wasn't...  At this point, again, he really didn't have enough time.  But he wasn't doing what you thought he was going to do at 1130.  And you're trying to find a reason why he's being fucked more than Jay got fucked.  And it is unprecedented that the number one guy is pulled off when he is beating...  Yeah, it's never been done before.  Absolutely not.  A monster like Letterman, and Leno is beating him readily. 
[01:42:00]  Letterman's not an easy guy to fucking beat every night.  Letterman's a funny fucking guy, and he's a very competent, good host.  And Nick just had a good point there.  It never happened before.  Never!  Where you get rid of the guy who's number one still.  That's crazy.  Jeff's not a magic touch.  That's crazy in entertainment.  Johnny was much older when Leno came in.  Jay is 59.  Now, to us, that's old.  But you know what?  Another six or seven fucking years, you could easily do that as a comic?  Right.  Absolutely, man.  I mean, I wasn't trying to come up with a reason why I think Conan's getting fucked more. 
[01:42:30]  I'm coming up with a reason why I think Conan has been losing,  and why he's been doing so poorly in the ratings.  I mean, I think that he does have a massive appeal for a younger audience,  and that is something that NBC should value.  Maybe they just pull the trigger way too soon.  Yeah, and Conan will be just fine wherever he's going.  And the obsession with youth in Hollywood,  I think a lot of times they miscalculate what people are going to look for  and what people are going to like.  Because it's a bunch of, don't forget, dude,  you're also taking, executives want to be the ones who get their guy in. 
[01:43:00]  That's why when networks, fucking network heads leave,  new network heads come in, a lot of shows get acts, projects get acts,  because people want their stamp on it.  All right, thank you, sir.  I appreciate it, John.  All right.  You want to see what Conan said last night?  Yeah, I was able to hear what both of them said, definitely.  They were funny.  I'm sure they were both great.  I mean, Conan was really funny last night.  They played some of his monologue.  It was very funny.  You want to do Jay first or Conan first?  Because, I mean, you know, if we do Jay first,  then people are going, why do you do Jay first?  Blah, blah, blah.  I say Jay first, just alphabetically backwards. 
[01:43:30]  I say Conan.  All right.  Tomato, tomato.  I'm just trying to make good radio.  Here's fucking Jay from last night.  Well, some good news from Afghanistan.  Did you hear about this?  Critics of the war have stopped referring to it as another Vietnam.  They're not calling it anymore.  The bad news is they're now calling it another NBC.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Welcome, of course, to NBC, America's most dysfunctional TV family.  Thank you very much. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, man.  Please.  Oh.  You thought the Gosselins were screwed up.  Oh, my God.  Well, nobody knows what's going on.  Conan O'Brien, I understandably, was very upset.  He had a statement in the paper yesterday.  And Conan said NBC had only given him seven months to make his show work.  When I heard that, seven months?  How did he get that deal?  We only got four.  Hey, who's his agent?  Get me that guy.  I'll take seven.  Well, all the late-night hosts are having great fun with this debacle. 
[01:44:30]  Last night, Jimmy Kimmel did his show Dressed Up As Me.  Show that clip.  Here he is dressed up as me.  My name is Jay Leno.  And let it hereby be known that I'm taking over all the shows in late night.  Now, you see, now, I was going to come out dressed as Jimmy Kimmel.  Put Jimmy's picture up there.  But, you see, I realized I do not have enough black shoe polish here at NBC to get my hair that dark.  I love it.  I'm fucking loving this.  I love it when they go to the physics. 
[01:45:00]  Well, yeah, it's fun how they're all having it.  I'm fucking, yeah.  See how fun.  They're still being a little too nice, though.  I really want it to get ugly.  Well, Letterman last night was pretty harsh.  He was throwing roundhouse.  I think, yeah, but you know what?  It's kind of annoying, though, because I'll say this.  Jay kind of laid off.  He did a couple of jokes when Dave's scandal broke.  But he was like, he really didn't want to be a dick about it.  And I think Letterman still got that bitterness because he's probably still pissed off at Jay.  You know, it's obvious.  But it's funny how when, you know, you get millions of dollars, you know, Conan will be, he's fine financially no matter what. 
[01:45:30]  Let's not worry about Conan.  So you can have fun with this.  Yeah.  If they were like, you know, fighting for their lives, it wouldn't be that funny.  If it was two deli owners fighting for a spot on the corner, you know.  Yeah, it gets a lot more personal.  Of course.  You know.  We're talking about two guys that will be fine no matter what.  He has maggots in his corned beef.  Right, right.  And this is what Conan did last night.  Anyway, we have an amazing show tonight.  We're going to have so much fun tonight.  It's well made.  What happened next?  What happened?  That sounded like a merge of two different clips.  Yeah.  What happened? 
[01:46:00]  I don't know.  Let's see if it gets better.  Oh.  My God, it's Kenneth the Page, everybody.  I didn't see this all night.  I didn't see that either.  But I was watching.  Hello, Mr. O'Brien.  Kenneth, what are you doing here?  Well, I have a tour group here, and they wanted to see the studio.  Oh, okay, Kenneth, I'm doing a show right now.  Thanks, Mr. O'Brien.  I knew you'd understand.  This is the former home of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.  Hey, hey, hey.  Now, Kenneth, I'm still here. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, okay, right.  The soon-to-be former home of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, and here's a fun fact.  NBC spent more time building this studio than using it.  Oh.  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  That may be true, Kenneth, but it is a beautiful studio.  Oh, yes.  It sure is, and it will make an even more beautiful storage facility for old office furniture. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, here's another fun fact.  Just like Conan, most of the staff here uprooted and moved their families to come work here.  Fucking lady.  In fact, Max Weinberg uprooted his family and his other secret family.  Oh, yeah.  You know, maybe, Kenneth, maybe you can do this later, if that's cool.  Oh, no.  No, no.  This is the five o'clock tour. 
[01:47:30]  It's always been the five o'clock tour.  If it's moved any later, it won't be the same.  Where would you get such an insane idea?  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Yes, mate.  Kenneth DePage, everybody.  He's a good man.  Dude, that was his setup.  He knew Kenneth was coming out.  I don't think so.  All right.  Let me say hi to Cutler, it looks like, the trucker.  Cutler.  Yes. 
[01:48:00]  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  I don't know.  To me, it seems like Jay Leno's shows make more sense, and they're funnier than Conan's.  Well, I prefer Letterman.  I mean, Leno, but it's to Conan.  But, you know, again, Conan does have his own quirky.  That's just a better taste, man.  Yeah.  Two different shows.  Yeah.  I mean, Conan does appeal, but it's certainly different.  It's a taste thing.  Whatever.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would say, I prefer Conan.  Right.  You know.  Yeah.  But, I mean, didn't you all say the other day, though, that if Conan lost his spot and 
[01:48:30]  they moved in past midnight, he's going to get, what, $50 million or $15 million or something  like that?  From what I, again, I don't know the intricacies of the contract, but Conan could have left  years ago for more money.  So, he stayed loyal, wanting the Tonight Show.  It was a miscalculation by NBC that Jay would still not be a fucking, as we say, a beast in  that hour.  So, they said, look, Conan, in 2009, we'll give you a Tonight Show, and if we don't give  you a Tonight Show, you can walk, and we'll give you $40 million.  And I believe that's what it was.  Yeah.  $45.  But when this was happening, I'm like, how are they going to pull Leno? 
[01:49:00]  We can't even get these guys to pay for our coffee around here.  How do you pull Leno now?  And then the economy shits the bed.  Right.  And it's really hard to justify letting a guy leave, not sure if he's going to beat your  guy, and then handing him $40 million.  It's very tough to justify that, to just let a guy walk and hand him $40 million.  So, then they were kind of forced into the move, I think.  This story, in my opinion.  That's NBC's fault, you know?  Well, yeah, of course.  They should have looked at their numbers better.  I agree.  It's not Jay's fault or Conan's fault.  Where's Jay going to be at?  I think they should give Carson Daly a shot at the Tonight Show. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, boy, he's got to be miserable.  Fucking kid.  Believe me, if they both stay, he's finished.  What do you mean?  He's got a 4 a.m. slot nailed down, guarantee.  I don't know.  I mean, if they put both shows back to the back, then their numbers will probably go up anyway.  No, for the Carson...  No, no, no, not for you.  I meant to hit it a little earlier, to be honest with you, when you said Carson Daly.  They'll both be fine.  I can see why you're a little confused.  My timing was way off on that, Nick.  Thank you for calling me out on that.  This is an audio thing.  He's like, wait, is that for me?  I wasn't trying to be funny, no.  Hit the chirpers right after I say something.  Right.  Sorry about that. 
[01:50:00]  I've got enough problems.  All right, Conor, thank you.  All right, take care.  And why don't we make it fair, and let's see what Letterman did last night.  Absolutely.  Nick, you said he killed with this thing?  Well, he was going after everybody.  He was kind of, you know...  I heard he say he ripped Jeff Zuckerberg.  That's kind of funny.  Oh, Jesus.  Did he ever.  He kept putting his picture up, which is great, because a lot of people, the average person  doesn't know.  You know, the head of a network.  He kept putting his picture up, and he was zinging Jay, and it was like eight minutes.  He was just brutalizing people.  Letterman could get vicious.  I like when he gets a little vicious. 
[01:50:30]  But it's not vicious.  It's funny.  It's like, this is what made him famous.  He was a cranky, cantankerous prick.  And, you know what I mean?  That's when I loved that show, and they get away from that.  It was like a different real feel to it.  It was unscripted.  You get to see it.  This is like old Letterman coming out.  Yeah, exactly.  I enjoyed it.  Okay, all right, settle down.  CBS hasn't fired me yet.  I'm still here.  Cold outside, isn't it?  Lousy cold outside today. 
[01:51:00]  You know, they say, from the Weather Bureau, they say it's caused by an Arctic chill between  Jay and Conan.  That's...  This...  I still have a show, right?  It is so far.  Did you hear about this yesterday? 
[01:51:30]  Conan O'Brien...  It's so, so confusing, ladies and gentlemen.  And Jay Leno used to be on at 11.30, then they moved him to 10, and then Conan O'Brien  was on at 11.30.  Now they want him to go on at 12.05, and then they would put Jay from 10 to 11.30.  Oh, yes.  And Carson Daly, now I've got to get a show in Mexico or something.  He don't know what to do.  I mean, he's just...  Hey, what about...  Hey, what about...  It'll make you dizzy. 
[01:52:00]  So, Conan O'Brien yesterday said, well, I'm not doing the Tonight Show at 12.05.  And you think about it, well, he's right, that the Tonight Show, that would, you know,  that's the next day.  It's not really the...  That's right.  It's like the day after, or what used to be the tomorrow show.  Right.  Right.  So he said, forget it, I'm not doing the show at 12.05.  Well, NBC went back to him, and then they decided to sweeten the deal.  They offered him 12.04.  Maybe you don't get it, but... 
[01:52:30]  I think this is still his monologue, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  But when he sat at the desk, it was when he kind of started freewheeling, and they had  a few clips thrown in.  He said something about Jay sabotaging NBC, and he said he did it when he was a kid at  his high school play, and they showed some actual footage of a black-and-white play where  stuff was falling down.  That's funny.  It was really fucking funny, actually.  Was it more visual, though?  Not really.  I mean, he was doing both, but he was brutalizing Zucker verbally. 
[01:53:00]  And now, the buzz is that Conan may leave NBC to start a show of his own at another network.  And I thought, where'd he get an idea like that?  What?  What?  What was that?  He probably got the idea from Letterman, because Letterman did it.  And the whole idea of this was NBC wanted to get a thing going whereby they wouldn't make 
[01:53:30]  the same mistake they made when Johnny quit and retired, that there were a lot of bad feelings.  They wanted to avoid causing more bad feelings.  Well, mission accomplished.  There you go.  Brandon wants us to find out what Tank Hankress thinks about the Leno situation.  God damn it, you're right.  Tank Hankress, he's a funny dude. 
[01:54:00]  He's a correspondent we have come in to steal his terminology.  He's like a man's man, Nick.  Yeah.  And he gets right to it sometimes.  Get Tank in here immediately.  Can we get Tank Hankress to give his opinion on the whole Leno-Letterman thing?  Tank Hankress.  Sam's trying to get Tank.  He's so fucking miserable.  Why does I miss having a stethoscope?  I'm looking at his glasses.  His fucking creepy tinted glasses.  I do love I miss. 
[01:54:30]  Here comes Tank.  Here comes Tank.  Nick, you're going to enjoy Tank.  You really are.  He's a man.  He'd be good to have you host a sports show again.  Okay, what's he, super guy?  He's the guy he has.  You guys are really laying it on here.  He really knows sports.  And he drinks pitchers of beer at Hooters every night.  Yeah.  He's that type of guy.  Hey, Tank.  Sucks pretzels like they're cocks.  Is it Hank Tankress or Tank Hankress?  Tank Hankress.  Tank Hankress?  I don't know.  Is that like Tank Tankress?  Yes, that was where this came from because Dumbbell didn't know the word.  Yeah.  Tank, say hi to Nick DiPaolo. 
[01:55:00]  Hi, Nick.  No, Tank, he said.  Tank, how are you?  Is that Eric?  Tank.  Hi, Nick.  Hi, Tank.  So, Tank, what do you got on the whole late night war thing?  That's right.  And why are your lips pasty white?  You're not the virus right now.  You're Tank.  Tank has a lot more confidence than the virus.  What do you got, Tank?  What do you got on the late night wars?  Are you nervous in front of Nick? 
[01:55:30]  A little.  Come on.  Come on, Tank.  Tank, what do you got on the late night?  Go.  It's a microphone.  Go.  Do you want to do it outside so you don't have to look at Nick?  Come on, Tank.  No.  What do you got on the late night wars?  Go, Tank.  Tank has nothing on the late night wars.  You're not even doing the voice.  At least do the voice.  Be Tank.  We want Tank.  Tank's got nothing on the late night wars. 
[01:56:00]  Come on, Tank.  Yes, you do.  What's your opinion?  I think it's because of Nick.  Come on.  Look at Nick and talk.  Is Nick like a man's man?  I do.  Is he intimidating, Nick DiPaolo?  Just a little bit.  All right.  He's not going to make fun of you.  Just fucking do Tank hankers.  I'm having my stomach scoped like an old lady in about two hours.  Right.  How intimidating is that?  They got to numb the back of my throat.  Really?  Yeah.  They spray the chin up.  I'm hoping.  Yeah.  There's other ways to do it.  Tank anything? 
[01:56:30]  It's a real cheap doc.  He's going to throw me a couple of fucking tic-tacs.  Head over the bed.  Good deep throat fucking.  Until it numbs it.  Jesus.  Tank?  Guys, a wealth of knowledge, you think?  Yeah, there's nothing happening here.  Thanks, Tank.  Jesus Christ.  Another big disappointment.  Holy shit.  Between him and the homeless guy.  Yeah, no kidding.  This is fucking tremendous.  Why is everyone panicking?  I don't know.  In front of live mics today.  What's going on?  It's really you.  Nick.  Don't they realize this is satellite?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, we got Bobo on the line.  You want to do the Bobo thing before break?  Have you heard Bobo on our show?  I haven't.  Bobo is...  I have trouble picking up a satellite in Westchester.  There's two trees in the county.  Bobo had a gig.  Yeah.  Some frat house in Buffalo hired Bobo to do some stand-up comedy.  Jesus.  To this end of the fucking...  Bobo doesn't really do stand-up comedy.  He wants to do stand-up comedy.  It didn't stop me and Jimmy.  That's right.  You got to start somewhere, is what...  Right? 
[01:57:30]  Bobo.  Bobo.  You got the magic touch today, huh?  No shit.  Bobo.  Holy shit.  Bobo.  Did he fall asleep on the phone?  Maybe.  Maybe?  Possibility.  Bobo!  Bobo!  The fuck's he got a blood sugar disorder?  He may be asleep.  He's reminiscing about the raping he took at the fraternity up there. 
[01:58:00]  What happened?  Did it get ugly?  Oh, he wanted to get an update.  Bobo!  You got to be kidding me.  Danny?  Well, what Travis is suggesting is perhaps we hang up the phone, terminate the call, and  call him back so that his phone rings and then once again wakes him up.  He'll definitely answer if it always wakes him up.  That guy named Bobo's too busy for the show.  You want to...  All right.  Call him right back immediately.  Nick DiPaolo's in studio today.  He's going to be playing comics at a fine comedy club here in New York City.  Yeah.  Next Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 
[01:58:30]  Very good.  What's the date?  January 21st through the 23rd.  Yes.  Next Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  You get to see Nick DiPaolo in New York City.  That's great.  And also, you got NickDip.com and Nick DiPaolo on Twitter.  How's that Twitter working for you?  I'm on Twitter?  That's what it says.  Is someone else doing it for you?  Is somebody making this shit up?  Yeah, I got a web guy.  Maybe I am.  I don't know.  Is he tweeting for you?  I don't fucking know.  I can't stand that shit.  My computer crashed yesterday.  Is there any...  Somebody call in that...  Is there somebody that can call in that just has turned their back on this whole technology 
[01:59:00]  fucking wave?  And can you do it?  Can you get along without it?  No.  Patrice tried.  He did try.  Unplugging from the grid, basically.  I'm not talking about donuts.  Why don't you want to be part of the grid?  Why don't you want to be part of Facebook and Twitter?  Oh, it's a fucking pain in the ass.  It kind of is, right?  It's overwhelming.  It's overwhelming.  But it's learnable.  It is overwhelming, but it's not that bad.  I know, but I don't want to...  It sucks.  You sit down.  I sit down and write jokes, and then I'll Google something, and then I start reading. 
[01:59:30]  And it just sucks time from your life.  You look up, and it's three hours later.  Your hands are all sticky.  Your back hurts.  You're out three socks.  We just went on Nick DiPaolo's Twitter, so you did not write...  You did not write...  What are you...  It's a picture.  It's me.  I know.  That's right.  You didn't write this?  Hey, kids, catch me on O&A tomorrow morning at 8.30 a.m.?  Yes, I did, actually.  Okay.  Wow, that one got through, huh?  Yeah.  So it's Nick DiPaolo on Twitter.  All right.  Yeah, now you know what it's all about.  I do something. 
[02:00:00]  I write something, and it goes to my MySpace, to my Facebook, to all that shit.  Yeah, but it's not Twitter per se, but it goes to my Twitter account, too, I guess.  I twit myself.  Nick, you'd be a really good one to follow on Twitter.  Yeah, you'd have funny stuff.  You've got some good shit to say.  Yeah, what's it going to get you?  Just give it a chance.  You know?  What's it going to get you?  Do you have the app on your phone?  Yes, I do.  No, I don't.  It'll make selling tickets a lot easier, because then you build it up, and then you can smack  them with, hey, bam, comics this weekend. 
[02:00:30]  Let's go.  Let's go, people.  I talk to all of my Twitter followers.  I preach.  They're worshipers.  When do you do that?  I'm so busy, what, with taking naps and lunch?  Normally, the Twitters I send out, I'm sitting on the toilet, and I'm pushing so hard, my  legs are straight out.  That's normally what I'm fucking typing.  Your legs are straight out.  Yeah, my legs are straight out.  I'm shitting.  All right, we're going to try this Bobo thing.  All right, Bobo?  Bobo.  Yeah, I'm here.  Bobo, what happened? 
[02:01:00]  Did you fall asleep?  No, I missed the call.  I missed it.  Anyway, what happened was...  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah?  What happened?  First of all, I've got to teach you something about radio.  People have no idea what you were going to do.  We've got Nick DiPaolo here.  So, you explained to Nick this whole thing that was supposed to go down in Buffalo.  All right.  Well, what was supposed to go down in Buffalo was this thing.  I was booked for this show somewhere, some frat house or wherever the fuck it was. 
[02:01:30]  I called this guy to confirm, yeah, I'll be there.  Everything.  The guy doesn't answer.  Why does he sound like Betty Davis?  Because, you know, he's got...  I was just...  He almost has the haircut.  And I was up in Buffalo at the Sigma Nu.  Bobo.  He's got little things going on.  Yeah.  How much were they going to pay you to go all the way to Buffalo?  You've got to explain this to Nick. 
[02:02:00]  It was going to be $100 plus $5 off the tickets.  $5 off of every ticket sale.  $5 from every ticket sale.  How long have you been working with Barry Ketch?  And he had to find his way to Buffalo, too.  They weren't going to pay for him to get there.  So who did you actually be sad?  Who set this up for you?  Sounds like my agent.  The guy that called in.  The guy that called me.  So some guy out of the blue calls you to give you this gig at a frat house in Buffalo. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, with some frat house being rent out for this.  Okay.  And you were very excited, Bobo, weren't you?  It was your first headlining gig?  Like, yeah, I was all ready for this and everything.  And I'm calling the guy right before I leave, right?  And the guy doesn't answer the phone.  So I just keep calling and keep calling.  And he says, it's all right.  And then what happened?  There's my, well, I'm just going to say a representative.  I'm not going to mention any names.  He's called in saying, what is this? 
[02:03:00]  You're not picking up and everything.  Not calling the guy, right?  And the guy, the guy got upset that he just, the guy just canceled, just like they just canceled the gig.  Why did he get upset?  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was.  So you never went to Buffalo is what we're getting at because people wanted to know how it went.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  He just canceled.  It just got so upset.  A lot of people would kill to have their plans fall through on Buffalo.  Yeah, I was just complaining about, because the representative that was representing me was complaining about that. 
[02:03:30]  About that answering.  I'm trying to, I was.  Who was representing you?  I see him now.  Who is.  Yeah.  Why?  The guy gets upset because you're just trying to figure out if the gig is still on.  So then he cancels.  That doesn't make sense.  He was fucking with you the whole time, Bobo.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  This guy was just messing with me.  No, that's not nice.  I don't like when they do this.  We're the only ones that are allowed to mess with Bobo.  No one else.  Right, Bobo?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:04:00]  This guy, if I find out who this guy is, I'm telling you, he's going to get whacked in the head with a baseball bat.  Oh, shit.  That's strong language, Bobo.  If I find out who this guy is.  Come on, Bobo.  What else?  What else would you do to this guy that really fucked you over?  Come on.  What would you do?  What would you do?  Would you suck his cock, Bobo?  Oh, I would hit this guy with a baseball bat.  And then you'd suck his dick, right? 
[02:04:30]  I don't know if you could sum up the energy to swing a bat.  See, I'm listening to you.  You sound like you got cancer in the ass and eyes.  I would just pee on that guy.  I would smack him in the face.  I would humiliate this guy.  By kissing him, right?  I'd buy him a house and pee.  No, I would just piss on this guy.  Kiss on him.  On his unconscious.  All right, Bobo.  Why do you want to kiss on the guy?  Kiss or piss? 
[02:05:00]  Why would you want to kiss a guy?  Why do you want to kiss a guy, Bobo?  No, I said I would piss on this guy.  Oh, you want to kiss him?  That's gross.  All right, so you're going to kiss this guy.  Where are you going to kiss him?  No, I said I would piss on him.  I would take a week on this guy.  Kiss on him.  That's creepy to kiss the dude.  Yeah.  Dude, yeah.  I mean, the baseball bat, okay, but the kissing thing gets a little weird.  No, no, they'd hit this guy with the baseball bat.  All right.  Then I would probably dump paint on this guy.  Did you play Little League?  I would dump paint on this guy. 
[02:05:30]  You'd dump paint on him?  You'd put your taint on him?  Why?  Why would you taint a guy?  No, no, I would dump a can of paint on him.  So you're going to kiss on him and put your taint on him?  That's so weird.  Why?  No, I would dump a can of paint, they said.  You'd put your can on him.  Dude, there's no reason to put your can on him.  That's fucking gay.  I can see you touching his taint, but you don't can him.  No, I said a can of paint.  Oh.  Yeah.  Give me a kiss on him, put your taint on him.  What else?  That's really creepy.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:06:00]  I said a can of paint.  I know why the guy canceled your gig.  You're a big girl.  No, no.  I said a can of paint.  All right.  We hear you.  What color?  Uh, see, I guess orange.  Well, if you're going to pick a color, I guess orange would be the...  That's like an Irish terrorist thing, isn't it?  That would be the go-to color, I guess.  All right, Bobo.  I guess orange.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  That was the funniest thing in a whole 20 minutes.  Yeah, what are we supposed to do with this Bobo guy? 
[02:06:30]  All right, so the gig didn't happen, because people want an update, and there's your update.  All right, Bobo.  We'll see you soon, okay?  All right.  Oh, wait.  Bud the Trucker.  I don't know why.  I had an out right there.  Bud.  Yeah, I think Bobo should go to where they work and knock the dicks out of their mouths.  Oh, can we play that?  Can we play that for Nick?  I think I murdered the line.  At least we could set it up.  We had Bobo in here, and we were trying to teach him comedy a little bit, so we had  Kenny heckling him as he's trying to do his jokes to see if he could, like, come back 
[02:07:00]  at the heckler, right?  And do we have it, Travis?  We're going to have it in a second.  And this is how it went down.  Check it out.  All right.  Well, they injected anesthesia, and you start feeling like you hear these people all talking.  Why do they fuck you in the ass?  Hey, you.  You there.  Yeah, I'm talking to you.  I don't go to your job and suck all the dicks that you work with.  That's perfect.  I suck at myself.  That's it.  That's it.  That's perfect. 
[02:07:30]  Bob Kelly was trying to teach him how to go back at a heckler, and that's what he did.  Oh, my God.  He's got the instincts to be a comic.  He sure does.  All right.  More with Nick DiPaolo.  Great counterpuncher.  More with Nick DiPaolo.  Here's the headline with Nick.  Comics next weekend.  Next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Yeah, baby.  Tickets 212-524-2500.  Quick break.  You want to try Mustard again?  Oh, Mustard's sleeping.  The show's only getting better, huh?  He's learning.  Can we wake up Mustard and see if he's got a song in him? 
[02:08:00]  You want to let him sleep through the break?  Yeah, let him sleep through the break.  I'm glad to see he's using his time wisely.  To practice.  And I'm for his big radio debut.  And I'm going to produce this.  Reinventing.  Work habits like that.  It's hard to see how he's homeless, huh?  I'm supposed to produce this CD.  What did I get myself into?  What do you mean?  It went viral in like two seconds.  Yeah, but look what's happening to the guy now.  They used to say that about my girlfriend.  All right, Oprah and Anthony, stay there. </pre>
