<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, employing their signature shock humor and vulgarity throughout. The show began with Opie detailing a horrific weekend stay at a decrepit Hamptons bed and breakfast, complete with unsettling decor, a broken AC unit, and a questionable owner.  Anthony countered with tales of a gentlemen's club visit with Ron and Fez, E-Rock, and a particularly pungent Big A, who engaged in humiliating antics with E-Rock involving a kendo stick.  They also recounted a boisterous outing to a Renaissance Faire or Medieval Times.

The hosts then discussed Jimmy Norton's *New York Post* interview, the emotional Hall of Fame inductions of Gwynn, Ripken Jr., and Schmidt (with audio clips), and a humorous debate about Rod Carew's batting style.  This segued into a conversation about Michael Vick's dog fighting charges, touching on potentially controversial racial and socioeconomic factors.  The broadcast played an audio clip of a particularly brutal helicopter crash.

The next segment heavily featured the box office failure of "Who's Your Caddy?" and the Arizona helicopter crash with fatalities.  Audio from the pilot's panicked final moments was played extensively, compared to Bill Hicks' comedy style, and contrasted with Jane Dornacker's final radio report before her 1986 helicopter crash. A caller, Larry, commented on the helicopter audio.  E-Rock's salmon-induced food poisoning, complete with audio of his distress, was also discussed at length.  Comedians Otto and George, from the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Show, joined the broadcast, sharing anecdotes from their tour, including experiences with Jeff Dunham and Billy Crystal. They also mentioned the success of *The Simpsons Movie* and contrasted it with the failure of *Chuck and Larry*.

Otto and George remained in studio for the following segment, which began with reminiscences about their past unpredictable radio appearances, attributed in part to past cocaine use.  Opie joked about sabotaging his upcoming bed and breakfast trip.  The discussion then shifted to recent NYC helicopter crashes, with an enhanced audio clip of an eyewitness account.  They also discussed other helicopter crashes, including those during Grand Canyon tours and air shows, along with graphic descriptions of the *Twilight Zone* movie crash.  Sam, fresh from Comic-Con, provided updates on upcoming NBC shows (*Heroes Origins*, *Chuck*, *Bionic Woman*).  A gruesome story about a woman accused of murdering and mutilating her stepfather followed, immediately juxtaposed with a "Feel Good Story Monday" about an 88-year-old man receiving his late Eagle Scout award. This led to war stories from Otto, including graphic descriptions of violence.  The segment concluded with a recounting and reenactment of Opie's disastrous commercial shoot with Shannon Elizabeth, highlighting the poorly written script and resulting vulgar outbursts, followed by a discussion of a Robert De Niro commercial outtake. Kenny Michaels, a friend of Otto's, then joined to perform *Sopranos* impressions.


A subsequent segment focused on playing various outtakes, notably from Orson Welles and Michael Jordan commercials, highlighting Welles' struggles with direction in Paul Masson wine and frozen peas commercials.  A whispered instruction from Otto to a guest was also highlighted. A call from Big A, a cab driver, recounted his frustration with his dispatcher and explained his absence from a previous show.  The show then played listener-submitted songs from a past "Most Offensive Song" contest featuring themes of AIDS, Auschwitz, and child sexual abuse, discussing the reasons for not airing some submissions. A Barry White outtake was also played, followed by a discussion of the NAACP's response to Michael Vick's conviction.


Finally, a segment featured Otto and George again, discussing Otto's career, including a Letterman appearance and struggles booking gigs outside New York/New Jersey. Otto recounted a story about a comedy club canceling his shows after a radio interview.  They discussed their upcoming tour and aspirations for broader success, including potential European gigs.  A call-and-response bit followed, with Otto and George performing their act, including impressions and offensive jokes. Kenny was also present in the studio.  The segment concluded with a mention of a controversial ventriloquist as the next guest, and Otto mentioning a trip to Katz's Delicatessen after the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  Opie and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off  so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[00:01:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi. 
[00:01:30]  It's a little early for some, but the phone number, 877-212-O-N-D-A.  877-212-O-N-D-A.  What's up, Anthony?  Ah, just through the weekend, you know.  Had a busy one.  A lot of fun.  We both had weird weekends.  A lot of action.  You went to Medieval Times or whatever the hell it's called?  That's what I did Saturday night.  The Renaissance Festival?  It's down there in Jersey, you know.  The Renaissance-type dining atmosphere. 
[00:02:00]  Medieval times, you know.  Yeah.  Seen it on Cable Guy.  Yeah, that whole setup.  And I went to a bed and breakfast.  Yeesh.  Bed and breakfast.  Mine started out with Jimmy at his signing.  I forgot that was part of this weekend.  Yeah, long weekend.  Thursday night.  That was a good Thursday night.  Had fun there.  And then went to the VIP club. 
[00:02:30]  Here in New York City, the strip joint?  Yeah.  When did you go there, Thursday?  That's a class jernt.  Are you allowed to call it a strip joint?  I don't know.  I know they kind of get mad.  It's a gentleman's club.  Gentleman's club, exotic dancers.  You start calling them strippers and all hell breaks loose.  I'll tell you.  And you don't even mean anything by it.  You're just like, hey, look at the fine stripper.  I'm an exotic dancer.  That place is full of babes.  Yeah, we've been there.  We've got a lot of nice looking girls dancing there. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Went there.  Ron and Fez and our own E-Rock was there hosting.  Was E-Rock really hosting?  No.  Oh, okay.  He just got up on stage and got belittled.  Did he?  Yeah.  And then Ron and Fez came out and the girls and Fez, he did his little dance.  Dave got beat up with a kendo stick from Poe.  And then got a stink face from Big A. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Big A pulled his pants down.  It's an old wrestling move.  Yeah.  And kind of put his bottom in his face.  Right in Dave's face.  It was really disgusting.  And if you know anything about Big A from this radio show, you know, when he used to do our radio show,  he's a smelly one.  Yeah.  Love the guy, but he smells a little bit.  It's kind of hard to get to those nooks and crannies, perhaps.  Let's not forget the prostitutes that ran out screaming. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Because of Big A's smell.  She's still having a problem smelling her own hand.  She's still eating sandwiches with her left.  Still bleaching the right hand.  And then it was, yeah, medieval times with Dave and Casey, his beautiful wife.  And, you know, people from Pal Talk and the show and Fezzy.  And we were just, we just made complete asses of ourselves.  We decided before we went in, we were going to be the group of people that just gets all the stupid stuff. 
[00:04:30]  So we had like, we couldn't, they hand you a paper crown when you walk in, like the old Burger King crowns.  And you put that on, it's like, I can't walk around with a paper crown.  So I went in with a cell and stuff.  And I got a cool court jester hat.  And big light up goblets and glasses.  And we got everything that lit up and flashed.  Like it was the most horrific scene. 
[00:05:00]  And flags for our yellow team.  And we're waving them and drinking.  I'm a little confused.  Out of huge glasses.  Are you trying to make it sound cool?  Or you realize it wasn't cool and you're just like, what the hell, I'll go with it here.  We wanted to be the biggest group of douches there.  So we wanted to be the people that had, like Fez bought this big glowing flashing necklace thing.  And I had the jester hat and a big, like, it looked like a lightsaber sword that changed colors when I pressed the button. 
[00:05:30]  And I was waving that around.  And everybody had little other laser-like things.  And everyone's glass either lit up or was this big, gaudy, fishball-shaped goblet.  I had a stein.  At this point, I got to break the news to you.  You never left your house on Long Island.  Oh, is that it?  So it's all in your mind.  We had fun, though.  We were yelling.  And it was a lot of fun because of who we were with. 
[00:06:00]  And then we went to some other restaurant there and played the trivia that you play over at the bar with everybody else.  And Fez kept beating me.  Yeah.  Kept beating me.  Because it was all stuff like TV Land stuff.  And then music stuff.  Earl, of course, answers the music questions.  It's all he knows.  So they have, like, a ringer whenever music questions come up.  But that's all he knows.  Like, anything else, try to get Earl to answer any other question except music.  Any other pop culture question?  Oh, he knows nothing. 
[00:06:30]  He does know his music trivia, though.  It's kind of scary.  He knows his music.  Fez knows, like, old TV.  I was keeping up with the old TV stuff.  But a music thing jumps in there.  It's all over.  But we had fun.  Good weekend.  Good weekend.  I hear you almost got murdered.  Well, no, I didn't almost get murdered.  But you probably did and don't even know it when you stay in those goddamn places.  You're insane.  Well, my girlfriend was convinced that we were going to be murdered.  So she's got good sense.  And she was waking me up in the middle of the night horrified. 
[00:07:00]  It was supposed to be a nice romantic getaway for us.  Took a rare Friday off to, you know, just kind of get away from things.  Decided to go out east here on Long Island to the Hamptons and Montauk and all that.  I just did the whole, you know, out east thing.  Scoping out some real estate is what I was doing.  Well, my Hamptons adventure is slightly different. 
[00:07:30]  Slightly different.  Oh, yeah.  Well, ahead of time, I called Kenny.  I go, Kenny, could you get me, like, a join in the Hamptons for the weekend?  Okay.  And he calls me after, like, a day or two and says, I looked into 22 places.  Everything is booked.  Jesus.  So, of course, he looks from, you know, the best place to stay.  I'm sorry, sir.  We're booked.  All right.  Second best is good enough for GH.  Sure.  I'm sorry, sir.  We're booked.  Tenth best place in the Hamptons. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sorry, sir.  We're booked.  All the way down to the, I believe it was the 23rd place.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  The 23rd place said, we have plenty of room.  Yes.  That should have been my first sign.  Haven't even gotten a single call for this place.  Plenty of room.  Turns out, like, I had no idea, but they're getting ready for the Clintons to be in the Hamptons this coming weekend.  They had Russell Simmons out there with just a huge gathering this weekend.  Usher's wedding was supposed to be out there this weekend. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, geez.  That he bailed on.  His, I guess, a pregnant fiancee, and he bailed on his wedding over the weekend.  Left her at the altar there, huh?  So a whole bunch of people that were associated with that were out there.  So it was not the place to go this weekend.  So I go, Kenny, they have room, huh?  And he goes, yeah.  So he looks it up online.  It says three out of five stars.  I'm like, ugh.  Oh, three out of five?  But three out of, I'm thinking three out of five.  Look, I'm kind of desperate.  I want to go out there.  I could accept that. 
[00:09:00]  That's like when chicks call up and ask, what do they weigh?  And they tell you.  Right, right, right.  That's what three out of five is.  It's not really three out of five.  That's what I learned.  If you look online and it says, you know, three out of five, it probably means one and a half to two out of five.  Exactly.  So all of a sudden, I get the address of this place.  I decided to go for it because we already got the day off, by the way.  There's no turning back, and we rarely, you know, get a day off to go and, you know, do what we want.  So I'm pulling into one of the Hamptons towns, and all of a sudden, you know, the address is coming up, and I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:09:30]  We're at least five miles from downtown, you know, whatever.  And, oh, no, it's getting close.  And all of a sudden, I realize we're like four miles from town in the middle of nowhere in this joint, a bed and breakfast.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Bed and breakfast.  That was my first sign that we're in a situation.  Was it a house? 
[00:10:00]  Like an old?  Oh, yeah.  It was an old house.  The guy's been doing it for 33 years.  Never will I go to a bed and breakfast.  I did it once.  They stink.  They are awful.  Remember Brewer's bed and breakfast story where the guy, like, what, hit on him or something?  Yeah.  They were getting massages, and next thing you know, the guy's nude with Brewer or something like that.  Remember that story?  Yeah, that's a good one.  It's one of my favorite stories ever by Jim Brewer.  So we pull in.  I'm like, I am so depressed.  Right off the bat, I'm like, I am so depressed, okay? 
[00:10:30]  And I go, don't worry.  We'll try to find another place.  I'm like, screw it, right?  Good luck.  And we couldn't find another place.  And now it's like, we're out here.  And I'm like, you think we can make the best of it?  I'm like, all right, we'll give it a shot.  So we go in.  We sign in.  And he shows me the room.  He opens up the door of a room that looks like your grandma would live in.  Of course.  Aren't they all like that?  Like, they try to keep them quaint.  I don't want quaint.  I want modern.  I want new stuff.  So all the stuff was really, really old. 
[00:11:00]  The bedspread, the blankets, the pillows, everything was old.  There were, we counted seven or eight chairs in the room.  A lot of them rocking chairs.  They had old, creepy pictures on the walls.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Where you're looking at this cute family photo and you know they're all dead by 50, 60 years.  They've got to all be dead.  There's a sketch from like a skating rink back in 1820. 
[00:11:30]  Just creepy old stuff everywhere.  Was there a stuffed like clown puppet in the rocking chair?  They had some like old stuffed animals and stuff.  Was there a bath?  Did you have your own bathroom?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was it.  That was the, yeah, I wouldn't share a bathroom.  Wow, there's my line.  I wouldn't share a bathroom.  Yeah, I'm not sharing a bathroom though.  You're so old.  So when we, when we walk into the place, the guy's quickly like, you know, buttoning up  his like old Tommy Bahama type Hawaiian shirt.  Welcome to the blank house. 
[00:12:00]  I'm like, huh?  So he walks us into the joint, shows us the lay of the land and, uh.  Were you the only people there?  No, no.  That's the weird part.  This is how booked it was out there.  His phone was ringing off the hook and that's what I didn't get.  Probably because no one stayed there before.  They had no idea.  How many rooms?  I think it was like five or six total.  Did you call it the blank house because you didn't want to say the name or you couldn't  because Al would have to dump out of it?  I'm saying the blank house.  It starts with an S.  This is, I'm saying the blank house because in the end, I feel sorry for the guy. 
[00:12:30]  I got to be honest.  I feel sorry for the guy because he really thinks he's running a good joint and it was  horrific, horrific on so many levels.  So then we walk in and he's like, yeah, the AC works, but he got to give it a little, a  little time to warm up.  A little time.  And it has like, it has like doilies all over the place, you know, just old.  Think grandma.  Was it, was it not, not, I'm not saying stink or anything, but was there like a musty old  house smell to it?  It sounded maybe slightly, but it all smells clean. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I mean, he definitely washes everything or whatever, but like old houses and old decor  just always smell old in a house.  Oh dude, it was, it was like a, it was, this room was just waiting to go up on, up in flames.  It was all just wood and it was just like, it was like humid and just that awful hot.  Yeah.  That you get in the middle of the summer in an old house.  And then he, he, he shows me the TV, which is like from 1980 something, a small little TV 
[00:13:30]  and I'm like, oh my God, the TV isn't even good.  And he goes, oh, well, someone stole the remote.  So you're going to have to change it by hand.  It's the old Sony Trinitron.  And this was supposed to be our nice getaway out east.  I'm like, oh my God, are you kidding me?  My chick is depressed.  She wants out.  We look around, there's nothing available.  So now we're like, we're going to have to stay here.  And like, she's scared crapless in the middle of the night.  Of course.  Waking me up because she's hearing noises. 
[00:14:00]  She's convinced he's coming in at any moment to murder us.  Did you have a lock on your door?  It was one of those, what is it called?  That one tiny little hook with the little, the little.  A hook and eyelet thing that like.  That was the lock.  You just hook it.  That is insecurity at all.  I know.  Flimsy.  That is so, that is meant for a bathroom.  So the door just doesn't swing open.  Yeah.  When a breeze hits, when you're going and you don't want people to see you. 
[00:14:30]  That's with those little clink.  Yeah.  Little hook and eye.  Little round eye thing and a hook.  Can I, I'll be completely honest with you.  At night, I actually, this is how sad it is.  Because it was supposed to be our nice.  Put a chair in.  I put a.  Under the knob.  I put a chair and a chest and all sorts of stuff in front of that door.  In case he was coming through that door to murder us.  I'm such a douche.  That's great.  So, and then like just weird crap. 
[00:15:00]  Like we would, we were gone all day.  I went out to the Montauk lighthouse and I went to the beaches out there and walked around town.  We went out to nice dinners.  Everything else was awesome.  We had a good time.  But at the end of every night, we're like, oh yeah, I'm going to go back there just to sleep.  You know, she's getting ready to go out one night.  The bathroom sucks.  And she gets a, she gets a, like a, a black curly on her, on her leg while she's showering.  Who?  Yeah.  There was, I don't know, from I guess the people before us, because I don't have any black and 
[00:15:30]  curlies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, that did not make her happy whatsoever.  Oh God.  And then one, uh, one night we're pulling back up.  It's still light out and we pulled back into the driveway and he's out there chopping wood.  It's like 90, 95 degrees, obviously late July and he's just chopping wood for.  And then he's like asking how our day was as he's spinning his ax.  I'm like, what the hell is going on?  And then, um, another day we pull up and he's like, I acquired this statue. 
[00:16:00]  Like this tiny little statue, statuette, I guess, if they're, I don't know.  And it's missing a head.  He goes, I acquired this statue.  It doesn't have a head.  I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet, but I acquired it today.  And he carefully places it down with all the other junk that he has in his yard.  He's one of these, uh, hoarders.  He's like a pack rat.  He has stuff everywhere.  A person that runs a bed and breakfast that isn't a kooky, that isn't just a little off.  It's got to be a, yeah, you got to be. 
[00:16:30]  It's the whole thing.  In order to open your house up to other people and have a bed and breakfast, you have to be  a little nutty.  Yeah.  So these people are like, they call them eclectic.  Yeah.  A little nut.  Oh, he's a little off, a little weird, a little, has quite the personality.  No, it's creepy, kooky guy.  And you're staying in his house with no privacy or no security, no room service.  Well, and one, every go down to eat breakfast. 
[00:17:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I refused, but, um.  If you have a bed and breakfast, you're either gay or your spouse is dead.  Well, there you go.  Funny you should say that, Jimmy, because, uh, it just seems every time we were leaving  the joint to leave, you know, to go somewhere, he was always around.  And, uh, he built this huge shed, like, it's almost, it's almost a house in itself.  It's that big.  It has two levels in the back.  And he goes, yeah, I just built that last year to, uh, put all my stuff in it because  I, I collect everything.  Like I said, he's a hoarder. 
[00:17:30]  He just has to, he can't throw anything away.  And that's why, like, you know, the rooms haven't been updated in decades.  The towels in the bathroom were paper thin.  And, you know, I decided I wanted to get some rays this weekend.  So I'm coming back to the room like a little sunburn and then the, the last thing you wanted  was to rub these towels on you to dry off.  It was just like scraping skin off you.  So we're, we're leaving and he notices that we notice that there's junk everywhere.  Just piles of wood and, and, and, uh, you know, and logs and stuff, like wood you would 
[00:18:00]  use to like build stuff, but it's old.  Everything's just old.  And he goes, yeah, if, if mother was still alive, she would make me throw all this away.  He called her mother.  Yes, I swear to God.  I'm like, oh, is that not right?  And, and that's when he was twirling the ax, you know, cutting wood.  I'm like, this is, this is supposed to be our nice getaway in the hand.  Yeah, it's Norman Bates.  Yesterday, the girl was just, you know, freaked out every night.  I'm like, oh, this is just great.  I'm trying to like, you know, have a nice weekend with your chick. 
[00:18:30]  And she's scared to travel.  She's sleeping with an eye open, waking me up every time she hears a noise upstairs or something.  And then yesterday, we're clearing out to leave to go to JD's birthday party there in Huntington.  And I go, and I go, hey, do you have a to-go cup?  Because he had fresh coffee.  The coffee was at least good.  And he goes, yeah, I'll be right back.  He goes, this is, you haven't heard this yet, Jimmy.  He goes and he comes back with two Dunkin' Donuts cups, two used Dunkin' Donuts cups with the lids already popped. 
[00:19:00]  You know, you pop your lid to drink your coffee.  The lid had coffee stains all over it.  And inside the cup, it was obviously a used cup.  There were still coffee stains in it.  And he digs through them and he goes, oh, this one's pretty good.  And gives me one he thought wasn't as bad as the others.  And pours the coffee into both of them.  And goes, here you go.  And then he goes, I knew these cups would come in handy someday. 
[00:19:30]  He saved his coffee cups.  Laying around.  Yes.  Probably found them rolling around his yard.  And I'm just like.  Rinsed them out.  Obviously, I just grabbed the coffee like, oh, thanks.  Really appreciate it.  Hey, you have a great place here.  We'll see you next time we're in town.  Take off.  Didn't even want to dump the coffee in his yard.  Because I'm sure he would find the cup.  And that would stir some kind of whacked out memory in him.  So you shan't be going back?  Oh, hell no. 
[00:20:00]  Hell no.  That's the problem.  You were polite.  Everyone's been polite to that old beg.  You should have said to him, look.  No one wants to drink coffee out of a used cup.  Yeah, tell him that.  Just say what?  With the lid popped already.  But they were mothers.  As he comes at you with a hatchet.  Mother got these cups.  How dare you.  Look, some still has mother's lipstick on it. 
[00:20:30]  That lid, that's mother's lipstick.  It was depressing.  It really, really was, man.  Kill them.  Kill them, Norman.  He kind of had that look to them.  They don't like your cups, Norman.  Yes, mother.  I know they don't like my cups.  Did you find one of mother's pubes in the shower?  Yeah, black curly.  Right on the back of the leg. 
[00:21:00]  Wonderful.  So, yeah, that was my experience, unfortunately.  Oh, and I got to tell you really fast.  So we get there, right?  And I know we're in a hell hole.  And I'm like, I got it.  I'm the guy.  I got to figure this out.  We either got to find a new place or get the hell out.  And it's like, we probably should have just left and tried to figure something else out.  I called our old friend Farid.  Because I know we had the house out there.  I'm like, hey, Farid, I'm in the Hamptons.  You're out here this weekend just being casual. 
[00:21:30]  Want to stop by and say hi?  He's like, no, I'm not here this weekend.  I'm like, oh, really?  Where's the key?  Under the mat?  That's what I was hinting at.  I'm like, so where's your house?  And he tells me what town.  I'm like, oh, we're right here.  We're in the same town.  And he goes, really?  You could stop by and use my pool.  No one's there.  I'm like, all right.  Give me the address.  And then I'm hinting like, do you have any doors unlocked or anything?  Maybe a bed?  I was too embarrassed. 
[00:22:00]  Farid, by the way, for people that don't understand, we work for a bunch of his radio stations for Citadel.  And I didn't have the balls to tell him that I was living, you know, I rented an asshole out here.  But I was hoping, I was hinting enough where he goes, hey, why don't you just stay at my place?  No, someone's probably there.  He opened the door.  How you doing, Opie?  Simus.  Yeah, Farid gave me the place for a while.  I'm hiding out here.  Hiding out.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Me and him are good friends. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, guess what?  We went to Farid's to check it out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, I tried all the doors, too.  Yeah, did you?  And then my girlfriend's like, you better not do that.  You know, he might have an alarm, and then we're going to be in, you know, more trouble than we are already.  Did you swim?  Oh, yeah, we swam in his pool.  Absolutely, we did.  Did you wee-wee in it?  Nah, nah.  But from the side.  But the bed and breakfast guy's like, I've been doing this for 33 years, 
[00:23:00]  and business is just not the same.  You know, I remember the days when people would come to this house,  and they would hang out.  I would rent the dining rooms.  I would even rent the kitchen table for the most part,  so people had a place to stay.  And now, people come here, and they just want to leave right away.  They don't want to hang out or nothing.  And I just didn't have the heart to tell the guy that his joints stinks,  and he's got to upgrade the whole freaking thing.  And I'm not really a bed and breakfast guy, but I felt like I had no choice. 
[00:23:30]  There's supposed to be-  I went-  My girlfriend made me go to one.  We purposely looked for one.  And it had, like, a little jacuzzi, and it was okay.  But it was run by a gay guy up in the mountains in Woodstock.  Of course.  It was okay, but I would never do it again.  And they make you breakfast, and the food sucked.  And it was awful.  Was it a nice bed and breakfast, though?  Yeah, it was.  Was everything on-  It was actually a really cool place.  Yeah.  It was immaculate.  It was-  The place itself was great.  It was only the fact I didn't like the food that he made.  Yeah.  Closest I ever came to a bed and breakfast, well, not even a bed and breakfast, 
[00:24:00]  was I rented a house upstate, like, for a weekend.  You know?  Instead of a hotel room, you rent a house.  But I didn't know it was the lower half of the house.  And the upper half was also being rented, separate entrance and everything.  But it was being rented by a bunch of college guys, I guess.  Oh, boy.  And it was just a stomping, loud-  I didn't really care at that point.  Just one big party.  I was out anyway, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  But that's the closest I can.  I don't want to see the people.  I don't want to see anyone else.  I don't want to have to talk to anyone.  I don't want to see the person that owns the place.  Certainly, I'm not going to sit down to eat with people I don't know like that.  No, I figured it was just a place to stay.  Because, you know, when you go out east, you're-  Crash pad.  Pretty much, you're going, you know, you're going driving.  Yeah, you're doing things.  You're doing things.  You're going to the beach all day.  So, you know.  But I did tell my girlfriend this.  I'm like, you have the wrong emotion here.  Like, she was scared.  Like, she was- 
[00:25:00]  No joke.  She was scared to sleep there every night.  I'm like, you got the wrong emotion.  Instead of being scared, you got to have the emotion of disappointment.  Nothing's going to happen to us.  And I go, and I'll tell you this much.  If we were renting this, you know, this room and this bed and breakfast in the middle of  the mountains, in the middle of nowhere, I would be scared as well.  And we would have, like, just drove home or something.  But it's in the Hamptons.  Nothing is happening to us out here.  Yeah.  We should be disappointed, not scared.  But I never got that thought implanted in her brain, unfortunately. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I stayed in a haunted hotel in Colorado once.  And their whole thing is to tell you all these awful stories about who was murdered in there  in, like, the 1800s.  And the daughter of one of the maids, one of the chambermaids, was killed.  Another person hung themselves off a balcony.  Like, it was just all these awful stories about this hotel in Colorado that was just haunted. 
[00:26:00]  And they hand out little brochures about how in the middle of the night, there's certain  rooms that you hear knocking from.  And it's all filled out on this pamphlet that is at the front desk.  And I read this thing and was terrified.  Yeah.  I didn't sleep.  I sat on the edge of the bed with the TV on, just looking at every door.  Shut the bathroom door because there was a mirror in there.  And I'll be goddamned if I'm looking in a mirror in a haunted hotel.  You shouldn't have been looking at that TV, man. 
[00:26:30]  You would have saw some images on that TV.  No, I did.  I looked at the TV.  I put on, like, cool, fun shows.  Like, how could something bad happen?  When Seinfeld's on!  Yeah.  You know, that's what I did.  But that's how they trick you in horror films.  It has a nice, you know, nice TV show playing in the background.  Something's good.  And all hell's breaking loose in the house.  And then you turn around real quick and,  It's right next to you.  Someone else is sitting on the bed.  Enjoying the show. 
[00:27:00]  What's that?  And I look and something's gone.  Well, the worst one, they do this in the movies all the time,  is you drop something and go,  Oh, hell.  And you bend over to get it.  Yeah.  And you pick it up off the floor.  And then you glean back to sit back up.  And some awful thing is sitting next to you.  Look, I got goosebumps.  I'm such a pussy.  It's not Seinfeld.  It's Michael Richards.  And he's doing his laugh factory.  Yeah.  Well, my.  Craver, no.  At the bed and breakfast, we're getting ready to leave.  And my girlfriend, she's like, 
[00:27:30]  I think I dropped something on the side of the bed.  She was too scared to even look under the bed.  That's how scared she was.  No, don't look under the bed.  So I look to see if it's under the bed and there's nothing there.  And she goes,  Nothing here.  Was it there?  I'm like,  No, but there's a little kid under there just waiting to scare you later tonight.  Holy Jesus.  No way.  And the whole thing backfired on me because, like, she's, like, I'm not kidding.  She was scared to sleep there every night, right?  And it backfired on me because I could control, like, just walking, you know, around, you know, with my own brain. 
[00:28:00]  But I can't control my effing dreams.  So because of her stupidity, I'm dreaming horrific crap.  Come play with us, Opie.  I'm dreaming horrific crap in the middle of the night because...  Ever and ever.  Right, right, right, right, right.  And then I couldn't even tell her what I was dreaming about.  It was that hard.  It was really bad.  And it had something to do with the accident.  I cut you and Danny up. 
[00:28:30]  It's encouraging when you're in the mountains.  Yeah.  30 miles of snowy road.  What I'm laughing is we're going to sleep.  I'm like, you shouldn't be scared.  You should be disappointed.  I'm like, I roll over.  I fall asleep.  Fast forward three hours.  I'm having the most horrific dreams because she put the thoughts in my head before he went to bed.  That's horrible.  I'm like, great.  Were you laying on the floor?  Wake up.  All right, we're really laying.  Jack, wake up. 
[00:29:00]  Well, good morning, everybody.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue in just a bit.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  So I'm out in the Hamptons this weekend and I get the New York Post.  And there's little Jimmy Norton, prominently featured in the Sunday New York Post.  It was awesome, Jimmy.  Yeah, it was definitely a great placement and everything.  It wasn't just a little article that was like buried in the paper. 
[00:29:30]  This thing was in the entertainment section.  You opened up the page and there you are.  A huge picture of you.  The interview was great.  The Happy Endings Tour continues for you.  Yeah, it was a full page thing.  I didn't think they were going to run it, to be honest with you.  I did the interview a couple weeks ago.  I'm like, there's no way they're going to run this.  And they did.  It's really good.  Is it online for people, hopefully?  Are we linking it on our website?  Are we doing anything with this for little Jimmy Norton?  No, I wouldn't.  If he had the post yesterday, you got it.  You saw it.  It was really good.  And it said fourth on the New York Times bestseller list? 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  That is awesome.  Yeah, I'm very...  That's awesome!  I'm happy, man.  Damn.  That's very cool.  And then, there it is.  There's Jimmy.  Let me see his picture.  It's huge.  Look at this thing.  Wow, that is big.  That's Jimmy Norton, all right.  You can bury this.  This is like a hot section in the Sunday Post every week.  It's the Pulse section.  It's all like the movies coming out and the books you want to buy and the video games and  all that.  All the big things.  All the entertainment.  And it's a full-page Jim Norton interview with a fine picture of Jimmy in a hoodie. 
[00:30:30]  It says,  O.B. Anthony's sidekick, Penn's Memoir.  I know.  Penn's Memoir.  My memoirs.  It's very, very cool, Jimmy.  Yeah, I was happy, man.  She was a young girl named May.  It's like memoirs.  He had a full bladder.  You have a quill.  And you're flying out to L.A. this week?  I fly out tomorrow.  I might be gone the rest of the week.  I might be back on Thursday.  I'm doing Kimmel on Wednesday. 
[00:31:00]  Hey, that's really cool.  Look for Jim Norton on Jimmy Kimmel this coming Wednesday night, all right?  And thanks to Anthony for coming Thursday.  Wouldn't have missed it.  Yeah, it was like 350 people.  We sold out of books.  I heard.  The biggest one yet in Long Island.  Three minutes from my house.  How could I not miss it?  That was nice.  If it was four minutes, I'd have thought about it.  That Shelby was beautiful.  He brought out his red car.  I thought it was a blue car.  Amazing.  Brought my race car with me.  And I heard some of the fans were making believe they were taking leaks on it.  Yes.  They thought they were being funny.  Getting pictures of them taking fake leaks on your car. 
[00:31:30]  They would have been pummeled.  And Jimmy, I would have been there, obviously.  But I needed to get away a little bit.  You were in some funeral home.  Oh, my God.  That didn't work out.  And Tom couldn't wait to barge through the door to go, that's what you get for taking a day off.  Thanks, Tom.  Thanks for the support.  We're having fun laughing.  I hope he's pushing, like, dressers against the door.  I don't know what it is with me.  Nothing bothers me.  Like, I could stay in a place like that.  But you got to, like, you know, look out for the girl, obviously. 
[00:32:00]  You know?  Yeah, that's it.  If I was just by myself, I would have just dealt with it like, ah, whatever.  But I have to worry about her emotions and keeping her happy, which, you know, it should be the case.  But I could sleep anywhere.  And I have slept in many strange situations over the years.  Shut the lights up in the bathroom and open your eyes real wide and look in the mirror and say, like, Crazy Mary, Crazy Mary, three times.  Yeah.  Very creepy.  All right.  What else is going on?  Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken in the Hall of Fame. 
[00:32:30]  Do we have any blubbering audio from those men?  We love when real men cry.  Yeah, there should be.  Let's see if, like, God, every time one of those people are inducted in.  And, you know, it was all about fans.  They try to hold together.  Um, um, yeah.  This is difficult for me.  It's been emotional all through my career.  I'm just glad to have a fan. 
[00:33:00]  One of the best ones is Mike Schmidt.  Oh, did he lose his mind?  Hey, Rock, you got some crying audio for me?  He's got to listen back to that clip and just go, like, what the hell was I thinking?  There's the clips right now.  You got Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken.  And Tony Gwynn was a fine, fine hitter.  But then I was telling Jimmy, the worst hitter in Major League history will surprise a few people.  Rod Carew was the worst hitter in baseball history.  Rod Carew? 
[00:33:30]  Because he would just slap at the baseball.  Oh, never really giving it that.  Now, I know some New York fans were going to go, well, it has to be Dave Kingman, who batted, you know, a 105 in his career, you know, but had monstrous homers.  He would have 30, 40 homers a year and about 600 strikeouts.  But Rod Carew, worst hitter in baseball history.  Because the guy would just slap at the ball.  It shouldn't have, half those hits shouldn't have even counted.  He never took a full swing, right? 
[00:34:00]  No, he would just use a slap at her.  He would just slap singles all day long.  All day long.  What?  What was his average?  What did he end up with?  He, like, averaged, like, some 320 every year, 330.  He was a great hitter.  I bet you his average was even higher than that, Jimmy, for his career.  Perhaps.  Not for his career.  No, I'm going to guess it was, like, 315 for his career.  For his career, he had 12,500 singles and four doubles.  And no homers.  Not even close. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, we got the Mike Schmidt?  All right, here's Mike.  4,000 singles.  He has three times as many as Pete Rose.  He has more than Pete Rose and Ty Cobb combined, plus 4,000.  And Barry Bonds didn't hit a homer, so we're still one away, right?  The Bonds boss continues.  It's obviously going to happen.  I mean, what the hell?  And him and Costas are going at it.  Wow, Bob Costas is just so brave.  He's a rebel.  A day after Barry Bonds called him a little midget man who knows nothing about baseball,  broadcaster Bob Costas said he wasn't upset with the San Francisco Giants slugger and responded 
[00:35:00]  with a jab of his own.  As anyone can plainly see, I'm 5'6 1⁄2 and a strapping 150 pounds.  And unlike some people, I came by all of it naturally.  He also said, I'm not a ****.  Oh, Jesus.  Bob.  I have to bring that into it.  Here's Mike Schmidt.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Watch.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[00:35:30]  I thank God the dream came true.  I love that one.  I thank God the dream came true.  Oh, man.  It's just so funny because he's a man's man.  And he starts off.  And you know, all these guys go into it basically saying, look, it ain't happening to me.  I've seen all the clips of all these other guys. 
[00:36:00]  I'm going to hold it together.  There's something about them standing there and they're going, you know, when I started  playing the game as a young kid, I heard what's happening to me.  My voice.  Did that just crack?  Right, right.  You know, when I first picked up a baseball with my dad.  But no, you're still trying to hold it together, though.  Yeah.  But every guy will try to hold back that gear. 
[00:36:30]  Sounds like you have bad gas.  Let me hear Mike one more time.  You want to hear Mike again?  Let me hear that because he starts off.  Yeah, he tries.  He's good.  His voice is deep.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  Dayton, Ohio.  Two very bad knees.  Uh-oh.  And a dream to be...  All right.  Can you stop this?  Go back. 
[00:37:00]  Let's analyze it.  He actually pauses here because he thinks he can control his team.  Very bad knees.  Yeah, go back to very bad knees.  And then it's a long pause because he realizes, uh-oh, uh-oh.  All right, just pause.  Get it together.  Listen.  Go.  With two very bad knees.  Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  Breath.  Breath.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Player?  And right here, he's like, oh, screw it.  I thank God the dream came true. 
[00:37:30]  True.  That true line is so...  The dream came true.  Wow.  He's probably snotting into his awful mustache.  Just mucus.  You know what?  Throwing out of his nose into his mustache.  None of it hit his lip because of that stupid, cheesy, 75-day porn mustache.  You know, one of the listeners had to remind me that this would be perfect for something. 
[00:38:00]  We're a little slow.  It's Monday.  Could you play that clip again there?  Oh, yes.  A year ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  No, no.  Why don't you start it off?  There you go.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  And a dream to be on Major League Baseball player.  I thank God the dream came true. 
[00:38:30]  There you go.  So, congratulations to Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr.  All right.  Hey, we got a very busy week ahead of us.  We're doing What the Hell is That this coming Thursday?  Yep.  What the hell is that?  We could use a few more contestants, I do believe.  Always can.  If you got something going on with you and you're like thinking to yourself, what the hell is this? 
[00:39:00]  Or what the hell is that?  Yeah.  Or maybe you have a friend and you're like, hey, what the hell is that?  You come in on this coming Thursday and we have doctors that will basically tell you what's going on with your body.  Yeah.  They take a look at you and go, ah, that's nothing.  You know what that's called?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then you go home, you feel good.  Or they go, ooh, maybe you ought to have that checked out.  Or you might have a few doctors tap out because they don't want to be sued.  They don't want to be wrong.  Or malpracticed.  It tells you you have a horrid disease.  Yeah.  Nah, we're looking for anything, even if you know what it is, just so the doctor can look at it and explain to us, educate us as to what it is. 
[00:39:30]  You can even come in here and make believe you don't know what it is, but you know what you've got is going to shock the hell out of the radio audience.  We don't care.  We don't care.  What about nose smeared on his face guy?  Nose smeared on his face guy.  I think he's coming in.  Is he?  Yeah, I think he's coming in.  So all you have to do is email Travis at foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Or you could give us a call right now, and who's working the phones today? 
[00:40:00]  Danny?  Danny's working the phones.  He'll take your what the hell is that, and we'll see if you qualify for Thursday's show.  877-212-ON-A, and we've got an iPod, no, an iPhone to give away this time around.  iPhone.  And a lot of money and some other fine prizes, okay?  Yes.  All right, we've got to catch up a little bit here.  We've got to take another break.  When we get back, helicopter crash.  We've got the audio.  Oof.  I don't think anyone else is really going to play this for you guys today.  Ah, baruto.  It is really, really brutal.  You hear the last words of someone's life. 
[00:40:30]  I imagine they won't play it the same way this show will, with certain other things.  Dubbed in the background.  I don't know what you're talking about, Jimmy.  We might be nice.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  We've got Brian in New York on the instant feedback.  He writes,  Rod Carew hit .328 lifetime.  3,053 hits. 
[00:41:00]  445 doubles.  112 triples.  92 homers for his career.  In 19 seasons, by the way.  He only has 200 hits.  4 out of 19 years.  You won't find a much better hitter.  And then he writes,  Dumbass.  Brian totally not getting what I was going for.  Opie was kidding.  I was joking.  He knows he was a good hitter.  I think he's an awful hitter just because he used to slap at the ball.  That's why.  It wasn't...  You ever watch Rod Carew play? 
[00:41:30]  It wasn't too exciting.  He'd run out singles all day long.  He was one of my favorite players ever.  He really liked Rod Carew?  He was abhorred to watch.  Loved him.  He never took a full swing.  He slapped at the ball just slapping singles.  He would hold the bat like his hands,  his left and his right hand,  were almost like just diddling and moving a little bit.  He would hold the bat so lightly.  He said this great way with the bat, man.  Boring, man.  Give me Dave Kingman over Rod Carew any day.  And we had a segue here.  Yeah.  Speaking of... 
[00:42:00]  Michael Vick.  What the hell is wrong with you?  This Michael Vick story is amazing.  The animal rights activists want to just tear all his limbs off him.  Well, his co-defendant might seek a plea.  And this one guy, his name is Tony Taylor.  He doesn't really want to go to trial.  And this is why.  They said Taylor, 34,  he found the property that Vick eventually purchased.  And they called the site Bad News Kennels.  And they spelled news, N-E-W-Z. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, wow.  That's cool.  Certain segments of the population do.  Take the S and the Z.  That's assertiveness.  And the Hampton Man also allegedly helped purchase pit bulls  and killed at least two dogs that fared poorly in test fights.  Like these dirt bags would kill dogs that didn't do well in the fights,  like leading up to the real fights?  Yeah.  And you can't feed and shelter a dog if it's not going to be fighting well?  We've got to get into this culture.  I guess this is...  I don't think we can. 
[00:43:00]  Huh?  Well, there's got to be people out there that understand.  You think you'd actually be able to go to one of these events?  Hell no.  Hell no.  Enough money?  Yeah.  Sure.  No, but this is not an isolated thing.  I bet on that.  This is not an isolated thing.  I've read a lot on this,  and it's going on all over the place.  Well, not all over the place.  It's going on all over the place.  I bet I could pick out places where it's going on.  Dude, you think Michael Vick lived in a hood?  He lived in a really nice neighborhood.  Not saying he did, but narrow it down from either a neighborhood to just a single house. 
[00:43:30]  Whatever.  There's just a certain segment of society that is doing this.  Like cockfighting.  Right.  Let's say cockfighting.  There's certain people that are more into the cockfighting than other people.  This is all I'm saying.  Right?  I don't want to get into stereotypes because words hurt, Opie.  Right.  And stereotypes aren't good.  We read the manual.  Remember the manual we read?  So you shouldn't bring those things up?  Yeah.  But let me tell you something. 
[00:44:00]  I don't see many Jews putting on cockfights.  Just don't see it happening.  But there's probably a few.  Maybe.  Maybe.  A few.  Maybe one.  Maybe one or two.  Yeah.  And as far as pit bull fights go, probably not a big sport amongst the Irish.  I don't think they're really getting into the...  They fight each other.  They fight each other.  I was going to say.  Words hurt.  Brothers are fighting each other.  They don't need pit bulls. 
[00:44:30]  So are you saying it's a black thing?  Let's get into this.  Hey, hey.  I never said that.  I'm asking.  Let's take that right off the shelf right now, my friend.  Or is it a lower class thing?  What are you getting at?  Is it a minority thing in general?  This is probably...  Puerto Ricans doing the...  In my opinion, based on things I have seen, it probably is more prevalent in the African-American community than in other ethnic communities. 
[00:45:00]  The pit bull fighting.  See, I always pictured guys like hillbillies or like those southern poor white tribes.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure that's happening.  That's why I always kind of...  But not like to this level of pit bull fighting.  Pit bulls, it seems like gangsters, rappers, the hip-hop guys.  Is they love the pit bulls for some reason.  Love having them pit bulls. 
[00:45:30]  And love having them vicious.  And the fighting is probably an extension of that, I guess.  Well, do you know, they guard drug houses, a lot of these dogs.  Yeah.  What they'll do is they'll actually have like...  They either train them not to bark, or in some cases they have it taken out so they can't bark.  They do something to them surgically.  Oh, that's nice.  You don't warn people that the dog is watching, so you go up to steal drugs.  And it just runs at you, and the cop shoots it.  Yeah, you find out the hard way.  Yeah.  Well, they said here, there's another thing that wasn't highlighted.  The dog fighting ring executed underperforming dogs by drowning, hanging, and other brutal means. 
[00:46:00]  Why would you...  Why would you drown a pit bull?  That's just savage and a way to...  You're having fun doing that.  That isn't a way to euthanize an animal.  Someone actually would have fun drowning a pit bull?  Hanging it?  Why would you hang it?  Yeah.  Well, hanging would be quicker.  Would it?  Drowning it's got to be just brutal for the dog.  Well, unless it's because the pit bull is vicious, it's kind of hard to...  I mean, hang it, like once you put the leash around its neck, then you hang it or you drown it. 
[00:46:30]  It's like, how else do you kill something that's that vicious?  If you hit it with a bat, you might miss and it might attack you, and bullets cost money.  How about you cut its head off?  Well, how do you hold it still?  You put a rope around its neck, you put a rope around its legs, you pull them straight  like you do with a pig when you shoot it in the head, and then you whop its head off  with a big machete.  Why not?  I think it beats hanging them or putting them in the water.  Michael Vick's never going to play in the NFL again. 
[00:47:00]  I hope not.  He's never going to play again.  You don't think?  No.  The NFL can't have them playing.  The animal rights activists, they're showing up at the court and they're yelling and screaming.  Just wait until you see his defense.  I'm sure it'll be all about this guy, the other guy, play the race card, blah, blah, blah,  and he'll be fine.  That's what happens.  I don't know, man.  This is a bad one.  They got bodies.  They got dog bodies.  I'll tell you about another football player where they had two bodies, and he's walking 
[00:47:30]  around with blondes right now.  Wait a minute.  Let me think.  Oh, okay.  Boomer Sison.  Wow.  Good old OJ.  Broke my arm, Boomer.  So you think Michael Vick's going to play again eventually?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't see this killing his career.  See, people are just saying he should be dragged behind.  Should be.  I mean, there's a lot of crazy things.  Should be, should be, should be.  What's going to happen, though?  You watch.  Well, he's not playing this year.  That's a guarantee.  He can afford a real expensive lawyer.  Time goes by.  People forget. 
[00:48:00]  You cop a plea.  You do this.  You do that.  You talk.  You negotiate with the NFL.  And before you know it, he's back out playing.  How many dogs died?  A lot.  A lot?  If he's found guilty, if they realize that, yeah, he did do this and he did know he  isn't, I don't know if he plays again.  The animal rights activist lobby is really powerful, and they will go after the NFL horribly.  They'll go after their advertisers horribly, and they got enough celebrities involved with PETA  and stuff like that.  That's a big one.  Yeah, man.  That's a big one.  This is going to be a tough one, man.  I don't think he comes back anytime soon. 
[00:48:30]  That's my opinion.  He's definitely not playing this year.  No.  No.  All right.  In other news, the helicopter crash over the weekend.  Wow.  That one's pretty brutal.  Huh?  That one's pretty brutal.  You know what?  I was just thinking about helicopters the other day, because here in New York, we had the  steam pipe explosion, and I saw a lot of helicopters hovering over the scene, and I  was thinking to myself, how the F aren't these helicopters crashing into each other more often?  Well, you're supposed to be able to see each other. 
[00:49:00]  You know, you see these all the time.  It was a nice high shot of a police pursuit, and then the guy gets out of the truck.  He's running.  The cops get him, and you hear the pilot say he's going to hover in that area, you know,  keep an eye on the police for a little while.  And I guess another news copter was coming into the same area to hover and keep an eye  on what the cops are doing, and they hit each other.  I wonder if one guy didn't see the other guy, or if a gust of wind, if maybe they were 
[00:49:30]  hovering too close and a gust of wind took them into him.  They shouldn't have been that close, where a gust of wind would have brought them into  each other.  But I'm thinking, yeah, they must have hit each other either from behind.  Well, they'll have a full investigation.  They shouldn't be that close, but, you know, they're in competition with each other, and  it's like, hey, hey, the other channel has a much better shot.  What are you doing?  Get it in there.  Get in there.  Get in there.  We'll get another, you know, pilot to do the job.  It looked like they were both damaged from the back.  It didn't look like the front was damaged, so I think they must have hit tails, and then 
[00:50:00]  oof, just right down.  Well, here we go.  We got to...  And you hear them screaming, which is horrible, before they go to the anchor, back to the  anchor.  When the picture gets all screwed up, you just hear like...  Yeah, so I caught that one, and we'll listen to it before you...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's creepy.  That's what you do when you're crashing.  You've got to go...  Ah!  Vander Slice from Philly brings up a good point.  Mike Vick is in federal court.  O.J. was tried in L.A. County.  Ah.  Huge difference. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  You have to agree with that one there.  All right, here we go.  Here's our helicopter coverage.  Aviation officials are still trying to figure out what caused two news helicopters to collide  in midair.  Four people were killed, one of them from our area.  Hey, oh my God.  Channel 15 and Channel 3 just had a midair collision.  They're in the park.  Oh, okay.  By the way, we were listening to this during the break, and Ann pointed out that this is  some of the worst acting ever.  That guy stinks.  You're seeing two helicopters crash and plummeting, you know, and knowing that most likely no 
[00:51:00]  one's going to survive, and this guy's acting just sucks, because he's from another news  channel.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm sorry, guys.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  Jimmy, we're in the middle of a serious story.  What happened?  She shot a clip on scene of...  Steve Martin was water skiing, and he fell.  Oh.  It was hysterical.  Oh, his movies are good. 
[00:51:30]  Why don't they show...  Oh, because Steve Martin got married over the weekend.  Yeah, and he had the little...  He had the mustache growing in, because he's doing a sequel to this thing.  Is he doing another...  Sure, as he should.  ...as he should.  Inspector Clusoma.  Yeah, why don't you just go and spit on...  Why don't you just go and spit on, you know...  Peter Sell?  Yeah.  Peter Sell's grave.  Just spit on it, and kick over the headstone.  Yeah, I don't get Hollywood, why they have to remake movies.  Just leave them alone.  And if they were that popular when they hit, just leave them alone. 
[00:52:00]  This Black Caddyshack, we got to talk about that a little later.  Yeah.  And it bombed at the box office.  Can we get the commercial for that movie?  I didn't mean to sidetrack.  I just...  I had a big laugh.  Just a belly laugh when I saw that incorrigible Steve.  So funny.  The Black Caddyshack, it's called Who's Your Caddy, and...  See, Who's Your Daddy, but Who's Your Caddy?  And they kind of threw it out there, and they didn't really want to acknowledge that it was  a Black Caddyshack. 
[00:52:30]  And now finally they're admitting, okay, yeah, it's a Black Caddyshack.  We just kind of changed the name to throw people off a little bit.  Yeah, they did, uh...  And it did horrible business at the box office.  All right, back to the helicopter guy with the bad acting.  Yeah, Channel 3 just had a mid-air collision.  They're in the park.  Oh, man.  Now, those were the cries of another chopper reporter at the scene in Arizona.  Long Island native Jim Cox was among the victims.  He was aboard the KTVK news helicopter Friday when it collided with a second chopper. 
[00:53:00]  Both plummeted 500 feet to the ground.  Mourners had been leaving cards, flowers, and candles at the scene all weekend.  Horrible, right?  Oh, we got more.  That's just a warm-up.  I never understood going to the scene and leaving stuff.  Maybe it's like just a human thing, a way of healing.  It's just morbid.  It is morbid.  We've talked about those roadside memorials where you drive by and go, oh, can I not be  reminded that I'm doing like 80 miles an hour just hurtling through the cosmos in 
[00:53:30]  this friggin' piece of steel?  I see some of those, and I'm thinking, how did they crash over there like that?  Yeah.  Sometimes you see scenarios, and you try to figure it out in your head, like, wow, man,  that person must have been really effed up.  The hell?  It's on the roof of a 7-Eleven.  How did the car get up there?  Here's the actual audio of one of the copters going down.  Police pulled this vehicle over.  So there's the guy.  He's doing his report live from his chopper as they're over the scene. 
[00:54:00]  Chopper.  Chopper, sorry.  Helio Chopper.  That's a faster way.  Chopper and copter.  Copter Chopper.  Police pulled this vehicle over, and the vehicle then backed into the cruiser.  There were no injuries to the police, and just simply took off, and that's how this all  ensued.  And it looks like they're probably just going to let this thing play out.  Now he's going into a parking lot.  Now he's stopped.  We'll see what happens here.  He has stopped.  This may be the end of this thing.  Well, he's taking off running.  Okay, now it's a foot chase. 
[00:54:30]  Okay, now he's jumped into another vehicle.  Okay, okay.  They're closing in.  Looks like they've...  Oh, jeez.  We're going to pull out.  We don't...  We don't...  We don't know what has just happened right there.  It looks like the police have closed in.  God, you...  You phone in.  You don't know what happened there.  You hear your guy going...  Listen, in the background, you don't know what happened.  All right, you know what? 
[00:55:00]  Someone...  Go ahead, Than.  I was going to also say, like, whoever's running the board over there has real icy nerves, too, 
[00:55:30]  because they slowly fade out the audio.  Fade it?  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like, cut it right off.  You don't slam...  You just turn it off.  They kind of...  Because you don't want to be unprofessional.  Meep!  Meep!  You probably don't think of it.  You hear a big noise.  You probably think they dropped the camera or something stupid or...  Right, well...  And then he's yelling that he dropped the camera.  She did come back a minute later, though, didn't she?  And go, uh, there was a crash.  Uh, yeah.  By the way, someone on Instant Feedback, Opie equals harbinger of death. 
[00:56:00]  We did the Tammy Faye audio.  I said she would be dead by the, uh, by, you know, within a week.  That was an obvious one, though.  That's...  Well, yeah.  Anyone could have said that.  And then I talked about the steam pipe thing where actually manhole covers exploding and  stuff just before the...  Yeah.  The day before the steam pipe thing.  Right.  And now this guy is saying that, um, when Jill Nicolini was in, I talked to her about  helicopters crashing.  Well, yeah.  Because she used to be the copter girl.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He said, wasn't that, like, you know, scary for you?  And she said, no, no. 
[00:56:30]  No, that stuff doesn't happen.  All right.  And now we got a longer version of the pilot.  Pilot sees a chopper crash.  Yeah.  This guy just does a Hindenburg thing.  He can't take it.  Really?  That's got to be a little rough, though.  You're up there in a helicopter just watching two of your, uh...  So he's in...  This guy's in another helicopter?  Yeah.  Man.  Holy crap.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, oh, my God.  Channel 15...  I can't even listen to this. 
[00:57:00]  It sounds too much like Bill Hicks.  It's freaking me out.  It does sound a little like Bill Hicks.  It sounds so much like Bill Hicks.  Holy crap.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, oh, my God.  Channel 15 and Channel 3 just had a mid-air collision.  They're in the park.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my gosh.  Phoenix Tower. 
[00:57:30]  Skywalk's in.  Just had a mid-air collision over here at the park.  Two helicopters.  Is this guy having sex or something?  Did you hear it?  He can't breathe.  He can't even frigging breathe.  It's like he's having sex while he's trying to...  The guy's seeing something horrific.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Phoenix Tower.  Skywalk's in.  Reporting from his toilet.  It's over here.  It sounds like he's on the ball.  Yeah.  Chocolate ring.  Ooh.  My legs have gone numb again. 
[00:58:00]  Chocolate ring.  Oh, my God.  Phoenix Tower.  Skywalk's in.  Just had a mid-air collision over here at the park.  Two helicopters.  Two helicopters down.  Oh, my God.  It's Channel 3.  That's...  Channel 3. 
[00:58:30]  And I don't know who else.  Channel 3.  I don't know who else was.  Get a hold of yourself.  This guy's good under pressure.  Doesn't he work for the news?  Yeah.  He's good under pressure, this guy.  I understand it's upsetting.  Yeah, absolutely.  But people did 9, 9, 11 reports.  I mean, awful.  There was a reaction, but it wasn't like this.  Yeah.  Phoenix Tower.  I got...  Switch Channel 3.  And then it's...  50.  That's...  I bet. 
[00:59:00]  I bet.  Hey, I bet.  I saw two...  Helicopter...  Helicopter...  You gotta hold yourself, man.  I bet.  Two helic...  He does look like...  He does look like Luke Costello when Lugosi...  Yeah.  He's coming in and getting out of the coffin.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Barry Ponds. 
[00:59:30]  All time.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, my God.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  Two helicopters fell into George Steinbrenner's box.  Channel 3.  And I don't know who else...  Channel 3.  I don't know who else was...  What?  Is he pedaling the helicopter?  That's my favorite part.  We've had engine failure.  I'm pedaling this thing. 
[01:00:00]  It's...  Oh.  Oh.  That's my favorite part right there.  It goes...  Tryna tell me...  Tryna tell me what he's trying to say.  Hamma, hamma, hamma.  What's he trying to say right here?  I had naughtin'.  Channel 3.  And I don't know who else.  And I don't know who else.  Oh, and I don't know who else?  Yeah.  I don't know who else.  I understand panic speak.  I was going to say, you speak panic.  Oh.  Oh.  Channel 3. 
[01:00:30]  And I don't know who else.  Channel 3.  I don't know who else.  Stand by.  Stand by.  It's like Channel 3.  And I don't know who else.  Roland is smoother on the phone.  That guy must have needed water so bad after that.  I'm hearing he knew one of the guys.  He was friends with one of the guys.  Really?  One of the pilots.  How do you know what copters they are?  I guess it's scissor on the side of the helicopter.  Oh, yeah.  It's right on now. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  You've seen the TV commercials for the news.  News.  Copter 7.  Copter 7.  But there's footage of the copters crashing.  It's like far, far away footage.  Yeah.  Like they have to highlight where, and then you see like a little puff explosion.  Is this what this guy was?  Yeah.  He's probably that far away.  They show his point of view right there.  That's what he's looking at.  So how the hell did he know what copters they were?  He knows who's up in the air from listening to the tower also.  Oh.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[01:01:30]  It looks like channel 3.  And I don't know the other helicopter.  Possibly channel 15.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Okay.  12.  I got you in sight.  I'm just off your nose.  Oh, it's a 12.  I got you in sight.  You're just off my nose.  Yeah, I'm just watching that whole thing.  It's another helicopter.  I'll get back with you.  Okay.  I think it was Scott. 
[01:02:00]  Oof.  Oh, man.  I think it was Scott.  Scott's nose, probably.  That's rough.  It's really rough.  Damn.  A lot of helicopters up there, I guess.  Yeah.  All the news helicopters all.  Checking out the car chase.  Yep.  All right.  Well, there you go.  And then someone's like,  I was wondering how you guys were going to make this funny.  Oh, my God.  Larry.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hey, Larry.  Nothing.  I was just listening to it and wondering, like, you know,  like you just said, how it was going to be funny.  And then all of a sudden, since you made, you know, 
[01:02:30]  the comment about the guy being in the bathroom,  I haven't been able to stop laughing.  And I think if you guys throw in one line at the end of when he starts,  you know, gasping for air,  say something like, you know, maybe,  wow, that chalupa went right through me.  Have a good day.  All right.  All right.  We really weren't trying to make that funny.  Sometimes, you know, it is what it is.  It's just very interesting to hear that going on, right?  It's real life drama.  Yeah.  Just awful stuff.  Poor bastards.  Well, we got the, we can go old school. 
[01:03:00]  It reminds us of what happened back in 1986 here in New York City,  October 22nd.  Oh, that was 86, huh?  Yeah, that's 21 years ago.  Coming up on 21 years, we had a cop to go down.  Yep.  Listen to this.  Okay, here's Jane Darnacker.  All right.  Could you stop?  Yeah.  Iraq, what's wrong with you today?  You're really slow.  This, uh...  And you were late today.  What happened?  Why were you still late today?  23 minutes and 50 seconds.  Let's round it off to 24 minutes.  Wow. 
[01:03:30]  I know it's Monday, but you're definitely off.  You're off a step today.  What's up?  Um, I was having some, uh, bathroom problems today.  And through last night.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bathroom problems?  Is that audio of you?  Oh, my God.  It's Iraq.  I'm in the...  Oh, jeez.  Well, now we can make it funny.  So we got audio of Iraq.  This is why he was late.  Holy crap.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  This is Iraq. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, God.  The reason why Iraq was late to work today.  Channel 15 and Channel 3 just had a mid-air collision.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Phoenix Tower.  Skywalk's in.  Just had a mid-air collision over here at the park.  Two helicopters.  Two helicopters down.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  It's Channel 3.  Channel 3.  And I don't know who else.  Channel 3.  I don't know who else was. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, man.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm good.  I just watched that whole thing.  I'm good.  I mustered us.  I just...  I'll get back away.  More audio of Iraq in the bathroom.  More E-Rock. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, God.  Fart equals fawning.  You know that by now.  All right.  What'd you eat, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Why bathroom problems today, E-Rock?  I don't know.  I decided to try some pre-packaged salmon in a roasted garlic marinade.  Wait, did that make you sick or just... 
[01:06:00]  Pre-packaged salmon?  Are you nuts?  I bought some yesterday.  Is that bad?  I would never touch pre-packaged fish.  It looked good on the picture.  It also said it did not need to be refrigerated.  Oh, my God.  What kind of fish does it need to be refrigerated after it's dead?  It said it was bumblebee tuna, had a nice salmon steak, and... 
[01:06:30]  Did it leave it out in the sun all afternoon?  No.  Brought it home and then cooked it in the microwave.  Oh, God.  Had two of them.  How could that possibly taste good?  I know, right?  Salmon in the microwave?  It didn't...  It looked a lot better than what it tasted.  Mm-hmm.  It tasted like cat food.  But you kept eating it.  And what?  Did you eat both of them?  Ate both of them.  You greedy jackass.  And how long until you were duck walking? 
[01:07:00]  I think around 1 o'clock I woke up and had been just regularly hitting the bathroom.  Have you thrown up?  No.  Just constant stomach pains and flowing out of me.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Flowing.  What?  That's a little food poison, my friend.  It's like if you opened a two liter of Coke and just dumped it into the...  That's pretty mild, though.  By the way, that guy Tay has the ONA interview up on his MySpace page, I think. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, very cool.  Yeah.  We barely interviewed the guy.  Yeah, but...  We got to do a real interview with him.  But here's the question.  We've been here an hour and a half now.  You haven't gone in the bathroom once.  No, but it's fine.  It's been really bad back here.  Like, it smells really bad over here.  That's just the microphone.  Yeah.  Nothing about that.  All right.  I'm sorry, Eric.  All right.  So why don't we go back to 86 before the break here.  October 22nd of 86. 
[01:08:00]  It was an NBC News helicopter.  This is...  Jane Dornacker.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  You remember her name and everything.  Here it is.  Okay.  Here's Jane Dornacker now on the end copy.  Thank you very much, Joy.  There was indeed an accident southbound on the Major Deegan at the Mashaloo Parkway.  An accident, a serious accident involving a tractor-trailer and a car.  It has been pushed off to the shoulder, but now watch out there now because another flat  bed truck is going to have to come to clear it, so yield right of way.  Northbound on the BQE.  We spotted that disabled vehicle in the right-hand lane before the Kosciuszko, not causing much  of a backup, but further northbound there on the BQE. 
[01:08:30]  Traffic is very heavy past the Kosciuszko all the way over to the LIE.  The outbound Holland Tunnel, extra heavy for you right now.  Earlier, there was a car fire at Hudson and Canal Street.  It has been cleared about heading to New Jersey.  The outbound Lincoln Tunnel looks a lot better for you.  In New Jersey.  Get the wire, get the wire, get the wire.  Oof.  Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  There's something that happened there. 
[01:09:00]  It's quarter of five, 16 till five on WNBC.  I'm the Joey Reynolds Show.  We're taking a man.  Copter Report from Jane Dornacker.  Let's check in.  Huey Lewis in the news.  What's that?  Oh, it was, huh?  Why can't anyone be, like, real?  Obviously, there was...  Oh, my God, they just crashed.  We heard what happened when someone's real.  They sound like they're panting.  That guy...  Oh, gosh.  But I respect that more than what we just heard.  Like, well, we're going to play some music.  Obviously, something horrific just happened. 
[01:09:30]  First of all, why would you go to music?  Now you've got everyone listening going, what the hell happened?  That's why.  You like Huey Lewis on the news?  Yeah.  You sit there on the air until you figure it all out.  So what happened?  Like, because, you know...  Tip to B-square.  Yeah.  You know how many people saw that go down?  So they're going to be calling the radio station immediately with, like, Eyewitness Reports,  and you go to a Huey Lewis song right away?  What happened?  Do we know?  Like, obviously, she died?  Oh, yeah.  That's her final words right there.  Yeah, I think it was a tail rotor.  Oh, so it wasn't a crash?  They lost the tail rotor and just went, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop. 
[01:10:00]  Do you know how high up they were or anything?  They were whatever.  Like, how high did those things go for traffic?  A mile up?  After you're a few feet up, it really doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter, really.  You pretty much just...  What's the second one we got?  That was the second one.  That was just the longer version.  The first one was just...  Well, what's in the longer version?  That's what we just heard.  That was what we just heard.  Oh, okay, okay.  With the...  With the Joey Reynolds show?  Joey Reynolds.  He goes to music?  But Huey Lewis, they were pretty hot back then.  You know. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, he probably had to get his music in.  Or the PD would march in and go...  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Is this a talk show?  Excuse me, sir, but a helicopter lady just...  We got to get our Huey Lewis in.  We want to, like, you know, stay on the air and maybe get some eyewitness reports on this one.  Play all the currents.  Right.  Huey Lewis.  All right, we got to take a break, but there you go.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony heading toward another One Traveling Virus comedy show this Saturday outside Detroit, actually. 
[01:11:00]  We keep saying Detroit, but it's outside Detroit.  What is it, like, half hour, 40 minutes from the city?  I think so, yeah.  I'm not sure.  I don't have the info in front of me.  First time I'm going to Detroit.  I've never been there before.  Have you, Jimmy?  No, I've not.  Ooh.  Jimmy's been everywhere.  I'll be there on...  I'm doing a book signing on Friday the 3rd at 730 at Borders, 34300 Woodward, which is in Birmingham.  I guess that's right near Detroit.  And then Saturday morning, we're all doing... 
[01:11:30]  The whole crew is doing, like, a big news show, and then we're doing the Traveling Virus Saturday night.  Doing a little local TV in Detroit.  That should go well.  Who's involved in this?  Everybody.  It's going to be us, Jimmy, and who else?  Everybody.  They're going to do a few different things.  Jesus Christ.  I think they're doing me and you, then they're doing me, you, and Jimmy, then they're doing me, you, Jimmy, and all the comedians.  The anchor afterwards is going to be like, oh, my God, I can't...  It was the O&A virus.  I saw it.  All of them are... 
[01:12:00]  It could have been Patrice O'Neal.  I don't...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  It's all brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Tickets still available for Saturday's show.  Go to VirusTour, one word, on MySpace for all the info.  And we're running that military special, I'm sure.  If you have a military ID, you get in free.  Hoorah.  Hoorah.  I got the info.  Who wants it?  I just gave the info.  All right.  That's all I need to know.  Military ID, you get in free.  This Saturday at the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show. 
[01:12:30]  Eight comedians, including hometown boy Stephen Lynch.  Is he from Detroit?  He's from Michigan.  All right.  All right.  Getting into other things.  The Simpsons movie, number one at the box office, $72 million.  Wow.  We didn't even talk about this, but we got to see the Simpsons movie before it hit the theaters.  And we all liked it.  Yeah.  I was discussing the movie with a bunch of people over the weekend, and the Simpsons have 
[01:13:00]  been on the air, what, 40 years at this point?  40 years.  Some ridiculous amount of time.  And I think if you're a fan of the Simpsons, you're going to leave the theater disappointed.  Yeah.  Just because your expectations are so freaking high.  You know, a lot of people, when you get past Homer and Bart and a few other people, you have  other characters that are your faves.  Yeah.  And they don't even talk in the movie. 
[01:13:30]  There's just not enough time to get all this stuff in.  You know?  Plus the fact that it was interesting that they turned it into kind of like an action  film.  Oh, they did?  Well, probably just because it's in the movies, you know.  They're able to do that.  Spider pig.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Spider pig.  Because they're able to do that, because it's a big screen movie extravaganza.  But, I mean, the first half of the movie, I thought, was better than the second half,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was our general consensus.  But, I mean, it's definitely a good movie.  Much better than, I now pronounce you, Chuck and Larry. 
[01:14:00]  Which came in second in the...  People still going out and seeing that disaster.  Nineteen million dollars over the weekend.  Even though, like, it just got horrendous reviews.  Horrendous reviews.  I can't even look at the posters.  This weekend, I'm driving into the Lincoln Tunnel, and I'm stopped, and I turn my head,  and there it is on the wall.  Just that big poster of, what's his face there?  Kevin James, in his tux, with a fire helmet on, and he's opening his mouth real wide, like, 
[01:14:30]  ah!  Like, ah!  He's all excited.  And he's holding a very fat-assed Adam Sandler.  Like, Adam Sandler's getting fat.  And he's holding him like he would a bride.  Of course he is.  Carrying him over the threshold.  This is like his sixth movie in a row that made over a hundred million dollars.  Of course he's getting fat.  He's getting fat, and he's making a face like, oh, boy, I gotta do this.  Oh, boy. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  And wild man Kevin James is making a, ooh, ah!  Like, yeah!  Party face.  It is so hard to look at the poster, but I can't stop looking at it.  I saw, like, a picture from the movie.  It was in the same paper that Jim Norton was featured in on the weekend, The Post.  And one of them, I forget now, is kind of, like, reaching his hand out and looking at,  like, the other one.  Let's say it's Kevin James looking at Adam like, come on.  Like, hold my hand. 
[01:15:30]  It's all captured in this picture.  Ah!  Yeah!  Sandler's doing a movie in New York now.  I was walking by Washington Square Park going to the cellar.  What does this guy do?  Oh, it's just just...  Jesus Christ!  God bless him, man.  What can I tell you?  But I wouldn't go see that crap.  Washington Square Park was, um...  It was, like, you know, 11 at night or whatever.  Lights all over.  It's really weird when you see a movie set lighting up Washington Square Park at 10 at night or 11 at night.  Yeah.  And some girl's asking, is Adam here?  And the guy's like, yeah, he's here.  And I actually stopped. 
[01:16:00]  I was wondering, where is he?  Where is he?  Can I see him?  I need a picture with him.  Is that his trailer?  Hey, by the way, Jim from Syracuse, you nailed it, Opie.  The Simpsons movie is good.  And it was good, because people are yelling at me.  In general, it's getting very good reviews from the fans.  Yes, that's not what I'm getting at.  Jim says, it felt like I watched a long episode on TV.  I think you can't help but be a bit let down or disappointed, just because there's so much material there to work on.  And you can't fit it all in a movie, that's all. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, it's stuff they fit into, you know, 20 years of TV shows.  You can't fit it in a movie.  And who's your caddy made $3 million at the box office?  All right.  A lot of people seeing that one.  The Black Caddy Shack.  At Carolina Pines, the membership is reserved.  But they're about to meet a man.  I'm in search of an application, sir.  Oh, God.  They're about to meet a man.  Rodney Dangerfield, perhaps? 
[01:17:00]  Just listen.  At Carolina Pines, the membership is reserved.  But they're about to meet a man.  Here comes Rodney.  I'm in search of an application, sir.  Oh, how are you with a shovel?  Shovel?  Did he call you a n-  Hold it.  This is a very exclusive club.  Who doesn't take no for an answer.  Oh, who the hell are you doing on my golf course?  Shoot the music video.  Jeez, did that guy sound like Ted Knight?  A black Ted Knight?  Wait a minute. 
[01:17:30]  Did he say, did he call you a n-  And stop?  Yes, he did say that word.  That's in the promo for that?  Yeah.  I don't know if they actually say the word in the movie.  And they're trying to keep it clean for the kids and stuff when they're trying to advertise it.  And they kind of went over that line.  Either way, they're selling the movie.  Double standard.  Double standard.  They're selling the movie.  Right.  Da-da.  With a black guy saying, did he call you and then it gets dumped? 
[01:18:00]  Don't say n-  Don't say n-  Don't say n-  We can't say n-  That's good.  What are you doing on my golf course?  Ted Knight.  It's in the music video.  You see that line?  It represents the property line of that estate.  Guess who closed escrow yesterday?  Rodney.  How much do you want?  It ain't about the money.  All I want is a membership.  It's ridiculous.  All right, girls, take off your tops.  Now.  As your legal counsel, I take his offer.  He's a rapper.  No. 
[01:18:30]  Wait a minute.  Now that sounded awful familiar.  We're taped for nothing.  Really?  Seems to be a bit of a conflict.  Don't you like to move on?  Like the old country club.  It's in the hole.  Oh, God.  Stop trying to remake great comedies, please.  As your legal counsel, I take his offer.  He's a rapper.  Not quite, huh?  God, yeah.  Their rules are unfair. 
[01:19:00]  You know, I don't back down for nothing.  So he'll have to beat them.  Sweet your eyes.  Wilson, shut up.  At their own game.  This summer, why don't we get together, take a little break, and get to know one another,  be friends or something.  I have a small job.  What do you mean small?  Are you trying to disrespect me?  They're turning this golf course into a slum.  Into a s***hole. 
[01:19:30]  This golf course.  Into a dogfighting pit.  Chocolate green.  Chocolate green.  We wrecked another neighborhood.  Words hurt, Jimmy.  Words hurt.  They're turning this golf course.  One of us has to go.  How you want to handle it?  My team wins, you go.  Your team wins, I go.  We're going to talk to you.  Got Patrick Minocchi with the obvious line. 
[01:20:00]  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  Your team wins, I go.  We're going to talk to Johnny Cochran about this.  He's dead.  Oh, wait a minute.  You killed Johnny Cochran?  It's a bear kind of club.  Big boy.  I want a membership, and I want to stick it to the main.  Faison Love.  Woo!  I know I got a banging body.  I got it going on.  Woo!  Hold on.  What?  Woo! 
[01:20:30]  Woo!  Who's your caddy?  Woo!  Woo!  You stupid.  That's got to be a tax write-off.  It's got to be, right?  Nobody would have written that thinking it was really funny.  Oh, my God.  Who's your caddy?  Oh, my God.  Every black comedy, just, it's awful.  And it's the same thing. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, no, you didn't.  You call me a...  Is it because white people are writing them?  Is that what it is?  Is it more like white guys trying to be funny with black people and not letting black people  just do what they do?  Is that it?  Yeah, that's why the black sitcoms suck.  It's a bunch of stupid white writers who are trying to write funny things.  They whiten them up.  They don't let them...  There's nothing realistic about it.  Don't blame whitey.  Yeah, but it's the truth, though.  They put them in white-looking homes with white dialogue and white... 
[01:21:30]  It's ridiculous.  And you know that ain't the truth of the matter.  And that's why it's not funny.  It's like, that's not what makes black people funny, doing little snarky jokes at each other.  See, it's funny to put black people in a purely white situation and vice versa.  Now, when you take, let's say, a movie where they took, I think it was Chris Rock, and put  him in, like, the White House.  And he's still, like, you know, all ghetto.  And he's out of place. 
[01:22:00]  And then all the white people start acting all ghetto.  And they're upper crusty whitey people.  And they look ridiculous.  And it just, it's hilarity.  I stand corrected.  I hate...  And when they're old white people, it's even better.  When old white people rap in movies, I can't get enough of it.  I have to play it over and over again until I'm laughing so hard that I punch myself in  the face and slit my own throat.  Don't forget the comedy where Chris Rock dies. 
[01:22:30]  And you'll never believe the only body he can come back into is an old white man.  Old white Republican.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Just like Heaven Can Wait with Warren Beatty.  Because that was a black version of that.  I like what old people rap.  Isn't it just adorable when an old lady raps in a movie or says, like, just some black lingo  or something? 
[01:23:00]  Hey, home.  I'm a hundred years old and there ain't nothing funny.  He punched me repeatedly, knocked my pillbox hat off, and took my money.  That's the type of rap I want to hear the old people do.  When an old lady walks up to black and goes, for shizzle, my nizzle.  You're like, it's a, oh, the, the, I can't even look at the screen.  This was the end of The Wedding Singer when Bill Broad got up and did the rap.  Stop it. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, have a stroke.  Shut up.  Break your hip.  Who's laughing at this rap?  So far, give her my voice, but I brought two friends along.  And next on the mic is my manhattan.  Look at her.  She's got old in her sinuses.  The dim, the dim, the ladies pimp, the women fighting for who?  And she's petrified of this guy.  Who would agree to do a duet with an old grandma broad?  Did she, did he shoot a tray up in that piece?  Yuck. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to, uh, oh, he hung up.  Laura in Queens.  Laura, what's up?  Listen, chocolate rain, right?  Chocolate rain, rain.  Yeah.  What's up, Laura?  I have people singing that who have never even heard of Opie and Anthony.  80-year-old cancer patients are...  Chocolate rain.  Yeah.  That's when, that, there's, we're tripping over it.  Can't get to that one fast enough there, Laura.  80-year-old cancer patients are singing that as they hit the nurse call button. 
[01:24:30]  What do you need me for?  Chocolate rain.  I, I couldn't get up in time again.  Chocolate rain.  There's damn softball on my brain.  Chocolate rain.  You better clean out the bedpan again.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  I sneezed and all my hair fell down the drain.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:25:00]  It seems to come out without the littlest bit of strain.  Wow.  Oh.  Wow.  I just, just about got that out.  Wow.  What?  What, Laura?  You're going to make me go right to hell.  Chocolate rain.  Why is that, Laura?  Well, I'm going to be on a chocolate rain roller coaster all the way down.  Yeah.  Hey, Laura, how black are you?  Uh, not black enough.  I'm not even black at all.  Oh.  Oh, my.  Could be, could this be the first time I didn't figure it out? 
[01:25:30]  She don't sound like a sister.  You, you lost.  This could be the first time.  Dude, you're slipping, yo.  You're slipping.  I lost it.  You're slipping, yo.  She don't sound black at all.  Oh, wow.  Like, it's not even close.  I am so far off on this one.  I'm not even, I'm not even anywhere near black.  I am, like, you can see through me.  How did you think this was a black woman?  I don't know.  Keep talking.  I still hear the black.  I don't know.  You've lost.  I'm sorry.  Sounds like she's from California. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, wow.  Mark it down.  I blew it finally.  She sounds like Sally Kellerman.  There's nothing black about her.  I'm officially history.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Well, thanks, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  Thank you, Laura.  All right.  No, thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Let's say hi to Kevin on Long Island.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, man?  I have an exception to that old white people rapping.  In airplane, that old woman that was rapping, that was pretty funny.  Well, that was Mrs. Beaver Cleaver.  That was Mrs. Cleaver. 
[01:26:30]  Do we have that?  And she was old.  And that was pretty much the first time it was done.  She was rapping?  No, she wasn't rapping.  She was just kind of talking jive to the two black guys.  That was funny.  Yeah.  Because when the guy was like, shee, then it said, golly, exclamation point.  And she's talking to him because the stewardess didn't understand him.  And she goes, excuse me, I speak jive.  And she gets up.  And it's Mrs. Cleaver from Leave it to Beaver.  You're not allowed to do that scene these days.  Oh, no.  You're not going to see that scene in a comedy. 
[01:27:00]  One of the best scenes in that movie was with the two little kids.  When the little boy walks up to the girl and goes, would you like some coffee?  And she goes, thank you.  And she takes it.  And they're acting like little ladies and gentlemen.  She's about eight years old.  He's about eight.  And he gives her the coffee.  And he goes, cream?  She goes, no, I like it black.  And she goes to take a sip.  Like my men.  She's eight.  That was brilliant.  And how about them all punching that woman in the face who was hysterical and screaming?  They would never do that in Hollywood today. 
[01:27:30]  Can we get those clips possibly?  Can you find some of those?  All right.  We'll take a break.  We got Otto and George in the green room.  They're joining the program next.  Is Otto making the trip to Detroit?  Of course he is.  Oh, very cool.  He's going to be part of the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show this Saturday in the Detroit  area.  You know what they say.  See a broad to get that booty at.  Leg it down.  Smack it.  Jack it.  Oh, got to be.  Oh, boy.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  They just call in a strike.  What happened? 
[01:28:00]  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Never would you see that today?  No.  No.  You got to work hand in hand with the gay community and make sure that you  don't do anything offensive.  It's got to be safe for the children, too.  How did somebody make a movie about the Special Olympics and not make it a total goof on retards?  It could have been a great movie.  The Ringer.  No.  Johnny Knoxville.  Did it with cooperation from the Special Olympics.  Why would Johnny Knoxville say cooperate with that crap?  He should have said, you know, go screw yourself and go find another project. 
[01:28:30]  Why would you work hand in hand with the Special Olympics when you're trying to make a comedy about the Special Olympics?  Something about Mary is a hilarious comedy and it was brutal.  Yeah.  That's what was so funny about it.  That's what makes movies funny is this brutality, you know, this political incorrectness is funny.  Other movies that try to steer clear of it, it's just, it doesn't work.  They suck now. 
[01:29:00]  So you get movies like frigging Kevin James and Adam Sandler holding each other.  And they're grossing huge amounts of money.  You know what's weird?  They're walking around going, wow, we got a huge hit on our hands.  And I'm sitting there like, among their circle of friends, are the friends actually saying, wow, congratulations?  Or are they saying, how the hell did you get this past the American people?  The reviews are awful on that thing.  Hey, you want, can we play this or?  Yeah, to a point.  Oh, you got it? 
[01:29:30]  What, what?  We can play it to a point.  To a point?  To a point?  This is an old movie.  Let's see.  All right, let's see how far we can play this.  When does Al punch out?  All right, let's play when, all right, fine.  When does Al punch out?  That's the game.  All right, let's go.  From Airplane, 1980.  Can you do something?  Put your mofo butt in into the bone, jacking me up.  Tight me.  I'm sorry, I don't understand.  Cutty say it can't hang.  Oh, it's Jordan.  I speak giant.  Oh, good.  He said that he's in great pain and he wants to know if you can help him. 
[01:30:00]  All right, would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine.  Just hang loose blood.  She's going to catch up on the rebound on the med side.  What it is, big mama.  My mama doesn't raise no dummies.  I duck a rap.  Cut me some slack, Jeff.  It's a cutting.  He's on the brush.  I think he's doing a big thing.  Chump don't want to help.  Chump don't get to help.  Say can't hang.  Say seven up.  Time ass dude don't got no brains.  Why would they dump out? 
[01:30:30]  There was an S word in there.  Oh, I didn't even hear it.  I didn't either.  Salmon?  Cut something out of that.  I didn't hear the S word.  I didn't either.  Oh, when he goes, okay, I got you.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We got Otto and George joining us next.  Also, a very disturbing story here in New York that you heard on the way in today.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't played that yet.  It is a good one.  And then, of course, we got to talk about the 88-year-old becoming an Eagle Scout.  Oh, what a ridiculous, you know, it's a feel-good story. 
[01:31:00]  Whatever.  We still got some.  Oh, we got some good radio on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Joining the Opie and Anthony show, Otto and George.  Thank you.  Otto's been killing.  And George, of course, killing on the comedy tour this summer, man.  Yeah.  The next date is this Saturday in the Detroit area.  All the info is on VirusTor.  One word on MySpace.  I killed. 
[01:31:30]  Destroyed.  Yeah, it was good.  It was good, man.  I tried to antagonize those Boston pricks, you know, just right away, get the Red Sox thing going.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm so proud of this stupid team.  Backstage.  Backstage, I was talking to Otto before he went on.  He's like, watch this.  I'm going right after him.  Yeah.  But you know what?  They respect that and they like that up there.  They like to get confrontational.  I'm still waiting for an audience to boo me, so I'm just trying to get it done before  they turn on me and stuff. 
[01:32:00]  You're trying to incite it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, it's tired just getting laughs, you know.  I want some...  It's fun when people hate you.  I think when everybody likes you, you're not doing your job as a comedian, you know what  I mean?  I brought the puppet with me.  I feel stupid with this thing.  I don't understand it.  There's just too many comics.  At least I have a puppet.  You know what, though?  But at least you're in a studio with us.  We see you.  We see the puppet.  So it kind of works.  I tell the story all the time. 
[01:32:30]  We interviewed dumb Jeff Dunham.  Oh, yeah.  And Peanut.  Oh, Peanut's the edgy one.  And I don't know why...  You don't know what he's going to say.  The little guy is the crazy one.  Yeah.  And I don't know why we agreed to the interview.  I don't even like the guy.  He seems nice enough, but I don't like his comedy whatsoever.  Yeah.  I think it had something to do with it.  The bigger picture, we were getting all the comedians from the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh, yeah.  So we kind of had to take guys that we probably wouldn't normally take so we could get the  real biggies, you know?  Yeah.  And he's on the phone doing his whole Peanut thing. 
[01:33:00]  And I'm like...  A phone-in?  A phone-in.  And I'm like, Jeff, is Peanut there?  He goes, yeah, actually, I feel like a complete idiot.  I'm in my hotel room with Peanut.  I'm working the puppet as I talk to you guys.  I'm like, why would you do that?  No one could see you.  I know.  Well, my problem is I can't get George's voice unless I'm holding him.  It's a weird mouth.  Oh, really?  The way B.B. King can't sing and play guitar at the...  I have that same thing.  Yeah.  I met Donovan when I did the Riviera in Vegas. 
[01:33:30]  And, you know, he introduced himself to me.  And then he walks away.  And my friend, Bill Sacred, goes, why don't you go talk to him?  I go, what's he going to talk about?  Just because he has a puppet?  Nothing to say to this.  It's boring.  It's kind of like when you drive by and someone has the same car as you on the highway.  You're supposed to wave or something.  Yeah, I know.  Why do I have to talk to him?  Because he has a puppet, too.  Oh, I got to tell you.  I did the Stress Factory last night.  Big A wanted to come down to the show.  And he called me up to cancel.  Like, why does this guy even have a phone? 
[01:34:00]  I couldn't understand his message.  He was like, two free tickets.  God.  It's really sad.  How many minutes do you have on your plan?  It better be a lot.  Stuttering minutes.  Yes, he has a thousand on nighttime, weekend, and blithering idiot minutes.  Hey, let's get Big A on the phone.  I want to see what that's all about.  Yeah, Big A had to cancel.  So what did you say to the Boston crowd when you came out? 
[01:34:30]  Because we were busy backstage.  That their stupid team stinks and they only won one game in 600 years.  And I heard a few boos.  But that's what you were going for.  You were going for the boos.  I wanted more boos and hatred and stuff, you know.  They're way too into their sports up there.  You know, burning down the city because they win a stupid pennant or whatever.  I don't understand.  Shooting out people's eyes.  Yeah.  Because they win the World Series.  By the way, a little advice for me.  Yeah.  Don't say you want boos because we still haven't played Philly.  Okay.  They're listening right now.  Bring it on. 
[01:35:00]  I don't give a crap.  There it is.  You don't know what you're getting yourself into, man.  Hey, they booed Dom Iwera.  I mean, maybe he's old to those people.  But he's a top flight comic.  They have no right to do that.  And they can screw themselves.  Yeah, they did boo Dom a little bit.  Schubert took a good booing last year.  Is he good, though?  He's good?  He's funny, yeah.  It was a sweater shirt.  It was the worst thing ever.  I booed him.  Really?  Yeah.  The sweater shirt?  His act is good, though.  Yeah.  Man, he's done some funny radio with us. 
[01:35:30]  But he didn't go over too well with the Philly crowd.  Yeah.  Was he all right afterwards?  Or he took it in stride?  He was, like, shell-shocked.  He's walking around backstage.  I think you only grow by bombing.  Every time you do a good set, you think you're Richard Pryor.  But, you know, when they boo you, it really brings you down to the fact that you're just  this close from stinking every time.  Jimmy and I.  Bombing all the time.  Yeah.  Jimmy and I drove back to New York together after that show.  Yeah.  We couldn't get enough of making fun of Jimmy Schubert.  And we love the guy, trust me.  But you also love when someone bombs in front of your eyes because it's just so much fun for 
[01:36:00]  you as an individual.  And Jimmy and I were coming up with all these crazy scenarios.  Because Jimmy Schubert's whole family was in the front row.  He's from Philly.  Really?  And, you know, they all went out to brunch the next day.  Oh, God.  And they have to kind of casually talk about it.  And he has to come up with some type of excuse why that went on in front of his family.  Took years off his life.  We were laughing so hard.  And then, what?  It's a two-hour, two-and-a-half-hour ride back to Philly.  We would not let it go.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  We would not let it go.  He took a ferocious bombing.  Really?  It was awful.  Worse than Burr?  Yeah, because that's a weird way.  Different.  Burr hit back in a weird way.  Bill made it really funny and really like, all right, well, that's what you want to do.  As a comedian, I was watching Burr go, you know what?  If I'm going to bomb, that's the way to go down.  Oh, yeah.  Swinging and knocking that seat down.  Swinging, yeah.  And in the end, Bill Burr did not bomb in Philly.  Oh.  I mean, go check out.  If you haven't seen the video yet, it's legendary now at this point.  It's up on all the video sites.  They loved it.  They started booing him like they booed Schubert and Don Marrera. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  And Bill Burr said, oh, yeah, no effing way you're doing this to me.  And he turned around.  By the end, a lot of the people in that crowd were giving him a standing ovation.  Like, holy crap.  They knew they were seeing something a little different.  They want to see what you're made of.  It's like playing Brooklyn or Philly's like Brooklyn.  They want to see what you're made of.  It's like, yeah.  I had, this weekend, I was like, I very rarely get nervous.  I don't get nervous at the cellar because it's my home club.  Yeah.  And I'm on Saturday late and I'm like, you know, because my manager was there and then  he brings Billy and Robin down.  And I'm like, I don't really know.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, boy.  What?  You've made fun of Billy Crystal on this show.  I never have.  Oh, yes, you have.  He brought Billy and Robin down.  Get the Billy and Robin clips.  Do you have a picture now with Billy Crystal?  And Robin together.  Really?  Oh, oh, you do?  Yeah, we all hung out.  Why wouldn't I?  Shut up.  He was nice to me.  He was really nice.  Yeah.  No, he wasn't.  The first time I met him, he was awful to me.  Did he talk to you in the voice?  You know, I'm just old blues singer.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:38:00]  Billy and Robin and I just sat there.  He's very talented.  He's a bad show.  Men of similar ilk.  Watch me.  Watch me talk like I actually know the black experience.  Watch me talk like I actually know what it's like to be a black man.  Can you dig it?  Can you dig it?  You forgot the can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Wow.  He's got real disdain from one of the greats in comedy.  I don't know.  I like Mr. Saturday Night.  The makeup sucked, but you know.  Yeah, he did look like someone just threw pancake batter in his face. 
[01:38:30]  He looked like pie crust falling off his face.  It was terrible.  He's so self-important.  Really?  I can't stand him.  I never got into Billy Crust.  And I picked up that trumpet and I started to blow.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You blow all right.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  What about like John Leguizamo and that crap?  Do you hate that stuff?  Yes.  All that get up on stage, one man show.  Growing up experience.  Garbage.  I saw his one man show.  I liked it.  Really?  Yeah.  I got it.  I liked it. 
[01:39:00]  You're more forgiving.  He's harsh.  Oh, I can't take that drivel.  Whoopi Goldberg.  Let me tell you something.  I'm a girl from California.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Stop.  How do you know the experience?  You don't shut up.  First of all, you're not a girl.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Get that out of the way right away.  When she first did that one person show, it was good because it was before everybody  had kind of saturated.  Was it?  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  She did a good Anne Frank thing, which you know, you didn't do so many black female performers  doing that thing about the Anne Frank house. 
[01:39:30]  You're like the politician on the show now because you want a picture with all these  fingers.  No, no, no.  Exactly.  He's always been like that.  Not at all.  I brutalized her.  I brutalized Whoopi on stage after Imus.  I brutalized her.  Really?  Way beyond where I should have gone.  And now she's going to be doing the view.  Then again, I did take that out of the special.  Did you really?  No, like one line.  Oh, really?  What did you call her?  Wait, what line did you take out?  Cancer in a certain private area.  Oh, really?  Yeah, only because it didn't get the laugh I needed to get to justify that brutality. 
[01:40:00]  That would have to get a belly laugh from every person in the room and the ushers to leave  that on TV.  Yeah, cancer.  That better be on the DVD.  Cancer's hard.  Cancer's hard.  I just, I found some stuff Billy Crystal does very funny.  Yeah.  But when he gets into those characters, I just can't go with it.  When he's trying to get pathos, I know it's sickening me.  Like he's trying to be profound.  And dramatic with that.  When he did that, because it was for Katrina.  I hate that, though.  It was for Katrina Charity. 
[01:40:30]  And he's doing that whole black jazz artist thing.  You know, my house blowed away.  We did it.  Oh, God.  And he's doing this whole, like, get sympathy thing.  And all I see is Billy Crystal squinting and trying to make his nose look like a black  person.  He's not getting sympathy.  He's raising money.  I mean, the act sucks, but the guy was raising money.  Then stand up there and do funny stuff.  Don't try to be profound.  Don't try to relate to the black man.  Don't try to make me relate because you're white and I'm white. 
[01:41:00]  And somehow that'll make the translation easier.  He's not.  He's an old Jew trying to be a black guy.  That's all I saw.  Fats Domino's floating down the river on his piano.  What is money going to help him?  Just help him off the piano.  Exactly.  Swim out and help him.  Money.  Better rescue him from his piano.  Hey, and it's got to be.  I don't know if we said.  There's no cursing, right, on this show?  No, not for another. 
[01:41:30]  That's a puppet back in the box.  This is my home.  Back in the box, Norton.  Yeah.  I'm at the top of Norton.  Yeah, Little Murders.  They'll never make a comedy like that again.  Or where's Papa?  Yeah.  Crap they're making.  Hey, how was the Letterman experience when you were in for Ventriloquist Week?  Martha Stewart was coming off and I was going on.  Was your puppet?  Yeah, she goes like this.  Oh, these things are cute.  I went back to the cell, bitch.  White collar criminal.  Hooah.  She's a hooah. 
[01:42:00]  It was all right.  Letterman's creepy, though.  You were great, though, man.  You were great on Letterman.  Yeah, go on.  Oh, no, but I swear to God, you'd think he was the real people.  He was fantastic.  Otto, you really were great, man.  Thanks.  You were you.  You didn't compromise anything.  You just didn't curse, but you were you.  Yeah, really?  Audrey Hepburn?  Yeah.  You called him Audrey Hepburn.  I did?  Yes.  I did.  That's good, right?  I told him he's old, right?  I figured he's insecure about that.  Good.  I knew I'd never be on again. 
[01:42:30]  You know, even if there is another vent week, I don't want to do it twice.  He is kind of creepy, huh?  Yeah.  You should be a regular on a TV show like that, man.  Leno would have a great time with you.  Like the man show.  Something like the man show I'd be good for.  Jimmy Kimmel would be a great.  I like the network TV.  Yeah.  Jimmy Kimmel would be great.  I'll talk to Jimmy Wednesday.  Yeah.  Jim Norton's going to be on Kimmel on Wednesday.  Let's not forget that.  I've never done it before.  If I ever get anything out of this business, I got to come in the side door.  It's never going to be through the front.  I'm too weird.  You know, I'm too unstable also.  It's not going to be networked. 
[01:43:00]  I'm not career driven.  I think the missing component with me as far as becoming a big star is I don't have a need  to get approval every day or from everybody.  I really don't care.  My dog likes me and my girlfriend likes me.  I'm happy with that.  And Otto, we've always loved you, man.  Yeah.  I was telling some Otto and George stories over the weekend, like back at N.E.W.  Yeah.  Some days you would come in and give us like an hour of just unbelievable radio.  Yeah.  Other days you'd come in and after like 15 seconds after us promoting it for like a week  in advance.  All of a sudden you're like, this is horse. 
[01:43:30]  And then you'd just throw your puppet in its case and walk out on us.  I'm like, what is wrong with this guy?  But we were upset.  Those were probably coke hangovers too.  I was partying a lot in those days.  And then you'd come back and try it again and then you'd kill.  It was just like, what the hell?  You never know, you know.  But the unpredictable is fun, though.  Like you were saying with the Boston thing, you don't want everyone just laughing.  You want some confrontation.  Yeah.  You know, some confrontation.  Mental illness is fun.  You know, it doesn't always have to be good. 
[01:44:00]  People don't get like you say you're not career driven or career motivated.  Most people in the stupid business aren't.  But they do things.  Like Jimmy's a smart guy when it comes to this business.  I don't think you're any more ambitious than anybody.  You just know how to put people in positions that do things for you.  Really?  Like publicists and managers, people that book things and come up with stuff.  So he'll have people that work for him. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know.  Well, sure, he's got to have help.  We just sit around and, you know, I know I could be doing more.  Work than I do.  Really?  I could be doing like voiceover stuff.  I think it'd be fun.  Kind of go out on a couple of jobs every now and then.  Yeah, you could definitely have cartoons.  But I don't.  But I don't.  And I don't know why I don't.  I should have.  This is your world.  This is fine.  This is fine.  Yeah.  This is it.  You're a superstar.  I don't want to spend any more time doing it.  Yeah.  That's all I want to do.  I want to sit here in front of the mic, do a little radio, have fun, goof with my friends.  Yeah.  And then, you know, maybe later on when this falls apart, I'll, you know, I'll be Mr. 
[01:45:00]  Jangers on a cartoon show or something stupid.  You know, but for now, this is fine for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm doing a bed and breakfast this week with Trish.  No, I am.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  You're really going to a bed and breakfast?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now I'm like.  You heard me talking about this morning?  Yeah.  She showed me pictures of the room on the internet.  Look at that quilt.  It's like chairs.  I'm not going to be in the room.  I'm going to be gambling in Atlantic City.  We're like 10 minutes from Atlantic City.  A bed and breakfast in Atlantic City? 
[01:45:30]  No, no.  It's in Ocean City.  I think it's like 10 minutes away or something.  Sit down, child.  I don't know.  See, bed and breakfast, you know, if you're in the mountains or near a beach-like community.  Yeah.  But near Atlantic City.  But you said it's not.  But that's.  I don't know.  She likes the quilts and stuff.  I don't know.  There's no pool.  It's the heat of summer.  There's no pool in this.  She's checking out the pictures online.  Yeah.  Stay in the Borgata.  Why don't you stay in the Borgata?  It's a great hotel.  Girls like bed and breakfast.  Bed and breakfast.  You know what I do?  Sneak into another room and put George in a rocking chair so that when people come in, they just scream 
[01:46:00]  in terror.  That's true.  These things are scary.  They scare people.  Go in there or head like when she's parking the car, just run in and squat over the pillow  and fire a deuce.  And then she'll walk in and go, look at this.  We cannot stay in this room.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Got me out of like six or seven of those things.  Make pataki.  Okay.  Hey, watch out for the people that run the bed and breakfasts.  Yeah.  Usually swingers.  I know.  Really?  They're trying to get into some creepy stuff. 
[01:46:30]  Creeps.  With their guests.  Yeah.  Because they constantly have people coming to their house and they're hoping, you know,  a few of these couples are going to take the bait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's going to be some weird things going on.  I want to get a full story after your weekend.  Picture Lauren Bacall in The Shootist, you know, telling me, you know, I don't want you in  this house with them gunplay.  Just watch that movie.  It was good.  Hey, the helicopter thing.  We played it earlier.  Well, Danny took the audio.  Yeah.  And, well, he added a little something to jazz up the audio. 
[01:47:00]  A lot of people out there going, oh, the smoking, the two guys with that, you know,  the anchor laugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, he added something else.  So we played it earlier, the two helicopters that went down over the weekend.  There was another helicopter in the sky and this guy gave an eyewitness report, but he  was out of breath.  It sounded like he might be in the bathroom or doing other things.  God rest their souls.  But he saw something horrific and it turns out he knows one of the guys.  So we play that audio again with a little bit of enhancement here. 
[01:47:30]  Holy crap.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, my gosh.  What?  Hey, oh, my God.  Channel 15 and Channel 3 just had a mid-air collision.  They're in the park.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my gosh.  Is he getting spanked or something?  The guy actually is freaking out at the fact that he's in a helicopter. 
[01:48:00]  He just saw two helicopters crash and hit the ground.  So he's freaking out.  Why is that surprising?  Those things go down all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grand Canyon tours.  Those things are always wiping out.  They try and keep it hushed up.  Yeah.  They smash and die all the time.  Do they?  Yes.  Screaming to their death just for a nice, pretty view.  Yeah.  Good.  I took that tour, by the way.  Good.  Yeah.  Serves you right for trying to feel good.  Yeah.  I did the helicopter tour over at the Grand Canyon. 
[01:48:30]  Did you?  The whole time.  That's exactly what I did.  You know when you get in a helicopter when your leg is chopped off and you're being airlifted  to surgery?  There you go.  Who needs to go up that high?  I did.  With one blade.  I heard all the stories.  Who needs to go up that high?  Yeah.  There's not even a hint that these things ever crash, but they do crash a lot.  Constantly.  And over the weekend here in New York City, one of the helicopter tourist things had  to land in a ball field on 79th Street on the Upper West Side.  Really?  Yeah.  There was some smoke from one of the gadgets and it turned out it was nothing. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  But the guy's like, screw that.  I'm taking this down immediately.  Put her down.  He landed it on a ball field.  See that Oshkosh air show?  A couple of little problems there, too.  That's near Chicago?  Yeah, there's always.  I know somebody who was at that.  There's always a problem.  And this year, no different, a couple of guys died.  Remember Vic Morrow, the great actor?  Ah, yes.  Whacked right off.  Him and a couple of Vietnamese kids that got on the cheap. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Well, Stephen S. from Bayshore is suggesting that these two helicopters went down at Vic Morrow  Park.  Yeah.  His last words.  My hat!  Wait, the kids died, too?  Didn't it?  Oh, yeah.  One of them was crushed by the weight of the helicopter.  And the other one was cut in half.  And Vic Morrow's head was whacked right off.  Vic Morrow lost his head.  Was that in the script?  No.  They didn't give Vic that page.  No.  Are you sure I'm supposed to do jumping jacks here?  Trust us.  It works.  That's the beauty of this day and age. 
[01:50:00]  There's the Oshkosh disaster.  Yeah.  Right up there on YouTube.  Hey, here's more of Danny's audio enhanced.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Just had a minute of collision over here at the park.  Two helicopters.  Oh, my God.  Two helicopters down.  Oh, my God.  It's Channel 3. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Channel 3.  I don't know who I'm doing.  Channel 3.  I don't know who I'm doing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Channel 3.  I don't know who I'm doing.  Helicopter possibly Channel 15.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  12.  I got you inside.  I'm stuck.  She knows.  Yeah, I'm good.  I just watched that whole thing.  I'm good.  I'm off your nose.  I'm off your nose.  I'm off your nose.  Oh, my God.  I think it was Scott.  Wow.  Jesus.  That sounded...  That's a little different.  Yeah, just a bit different.  That was like porn.  Almost.  Almost.  We used to let a little time go by before we started messing with the story. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, now it's just bad.  It sounds like short bereavement here.  Yeah, right.  The O&A show.  I obviously feel bad for the people involved and everything, but this is just one of these  things, again, that the news is catering to America is just a bunch of vultures that  want to see these car chases up close.  I'm guilty of it.  Yeah.  When there's a car chase on TV, go, go, shoot him, kill him.  I want to see the cops pull him out and just blow his head off or something.  That's our nature. 
[01:52:00]  And the copter view.  So we all want to see this.  They cater to it.  They give it to us.  And when you get five helicopters in the area hovering over one car, it might be a problem.  I'm not sure which way the car is going to turn, so the helicopter is going to turn drastically  at every turn.  Our true nature is rape and slaughter.  That's it.  This is all an illusion.  This is some weird illusion that's trying to put this blanket of goodness and political  correctness over us.  And all we are are animals that love to see death, destruction, and all that. 
[01:52:30]  How much were you laughing when you saw that Iraqi soccer victory dance they were doing?  Oh.  They're shooting their weapons in the air.  After winning the soccer match.  After winning the soccer match.  It's the first time Iraq has won.  You know, they're a war-torn country.  They're very proud of their soccer team.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, the last soccer team, one of Saddam's kids had put to death.  Oh, yeah, for losing.  For losing. 
[01:53:00]  So the whole team got tortured and put to death.  That's why they're...  It's a motivator, isn't it?  Yeah.  Wow.  So they won.  Well, it worked.  They won.  They won.  Oh, Jesus.  And then as their little victory thing, like we do here in the States, they fire their  AK-47s up in the air.  And the bullets come down.  Four people dead.  Really?  17 wounded from gunfire.  Wow.  You make it sound like we don't do this in America.  We do this in America.  No, we tip over cars and light them on fire.  Yeah, we do some crazy crap, too, when our team wins.  And occasionally the cops have to shoot an eye out with a beanbag.  Yeah.  But, I mean, just civilians out in the street firing machine guns into the air. 
[01:53:30]  So the bullets came down and killed people.  Came down, killed people.  They're going that fast just from dropping?  Yeah, I guess that.  And maybe a few people didn't shoot high enough.  Didn't shoot high enough, yeah.  Into buildings.  I don't know what the hell they're doing over there.  Got to lift their gun in the air.  Wow.  Just start shooting.  Hey, we got to take a quick break because there's two really good stories we want to try to get  to on this side of the Opie and Anthony show.  A girl accused of killing her stepfather and cutting off his...  Okay.  It's an amazing story. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  And also the 88-year-old Eagle Scout.  Yes.  This story is made for you, Otto.  Okay.  After the break.  Are we promoting anything?  I do my duty and do my best.  Oh.  I did my duty.  Please help me.  I have to change.  Oh, what I have to say is Show Boat, Hotel and Casino, September 22nd, Otto and George  and Reverend Bob Levy from some other unknown show.  Oh, you can say it from the Howard School.  Yeah.  It's fine.  We love Bob.  We don't give a crap about any of that stuff in the end.  Yeah.  The Show Boat, eh, whatever. 
[01:54:30]  It's a...  They're allowing you down there?  It's nice of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a huge poker tournament we were supposed to do with them.  Yeah.  They're trying.  Because of a little controversy we got into, they panicked and canceled the whole damn thing.  Really?  What?  And we were really excited about going down there for our poker tournament.  Yeah.  I say you take it to the Bogata.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to take it to the Bogata.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Bogata's nice.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Otto and George in studio. 
[01:55:00]  Our own Sam came back from San Diego.  I forgot that he went out there this weekend for...  Sam Diego, I call it.  Sam Diego.  He went to Comic-Con.  Comic-Con.  On, what, NBC's die?  Yes, NBC.  They're promoting a lot of their NBC shows?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They put all their new shows up at Comic-Con for the first time.  Like Heroes?  Heroes was there for season two.  Was Cheerleader Chick there?  She was there the whole cast.  Was she hot?  Yes, she was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a cute girl, that girl.  And Heroes announced that they're doing another series called Heroes Origins. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, bro.  That's going to be like CSI where they just have 18,000 different spinoffs?  Well, it's like a six-episode series, so it's not...  What's the difference, Sam, between Heroes and Hero Origins?  Well, Heroes Origins is like...  Quickly.  It's a one-and-done thing, so each episode will center around one character and storyline,  not a continuous thing.  And they'll have special writers and directors, like Kevin Smith, will be doing an episode.  Well, I'll look forward to that one.  Yeah, we'll check that out.  You're prepared.  Well, I took note.  Also, the new series, though, where Chuck and the Bionic Woman... 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, I saw the trailer for the Bionic Woman.  They both also feature very attractive young ladies.  Who is the Bionic Woman this time around?  Heather Mills.  Michelle Ryan is the name of the actress, but...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What?  Yeah, she's British.  Okay.  She has an accent, which a lot of people will be surprised, because on the show, she sounds  American, but she's got a British accent.  Some of them Brits are good at that.  I like it in the trailer where she gets up, because they didn't show this in the old 
[01:56:30]  TV series, where she kind of wakes up, she's a little groggy, she looks down and sees her  Bionic legs and kind of freaks out.  She gets really pissed off.  It's not like, oh, thanks for the Bionic legs that look like legs.  They kind of looked weird and were freaking her out, and she freaked out.  Yeah, much more natural reaction.  Yeah.  Did they explain how she's able to hold back a car when she doesn't weigh, like, three tons?  Well, not in the pilot, but I'm assuming that that will be explored later on.  I don't know how that's going to be explored, because I never understood how the Bionic man  or woman could actually, like, hold back a car when the weight and the friction on their 
[01:57:00]  shoes between, like, that and the street wouldn't possibly be able to hold back the car, no matter  if you had Bionic legs or not.  I think it has to do...  a point where, you know, you would need that weight to hold the car back.  I think it has to do with the Bionics in the body.  I need an explanation.  I think that's...  Maybe that'll come out in the show.  Will she be fighting Bigfoot in a Bigfoot that doesn't look like Chaka from Land of the 
[01:57:30]  Longest?  Chaka, remember that one?  I forgot about that.  That was the Bionic man versus Bigfoot episode.  It was awful.  It was horrible.  Boy, were they running out of ideas.  That was awful.  Sasquatch, what a queer...  New series is a little less cartoony.  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  Is the same noise being made for the stupid movement?  Yeah.  It's subtle.  It's in there.  It's a little...  All right.  Well, you had a good time, San Diego.  That's the important thing.  That is the important thing.  And all your pictures are up on the website, so...  Yes.  What is Chuck?  Oh, Chuck.  Chuck is a series about a slacker who ends up accidentally getting all the government secrets put into his 
[01:58:00]  head via email.  Yes.  What?  It's like a mixture...  Via email?  Yes, via email.  It's like a mixture of the born identity meets 40-year-old virgin.  Oh, Christ.  It wasn't my email.  He would have gotten nothing but ads on how to make his penis larger.  Yes.  Those are all the secrets he'd have.  Chucksecret.com is the website.  I thought they finally found the brother from Happy Days and gave him a spin-off show 30 years later. 
[01:58:30]  That's right.  And he's in Thailand doing video work.  Hey, Tom Snyder died from leukemia.  Yeah.  Oh, Tom Snyder's dead?  71 years old.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Dead, sir.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Look at you, Sam.  That's just breaking.  Pictures of you with everyone there?  That's the cast of Chuck right there.  My goodness.  And Sam.  Chuck and Sam.  Well, congrats.  Yeah.  Check out the pictures on our website.  All right.  Moving on.  Very good, Sam.  Thank you. 
[01:59:00]  This is one of your stories of the day.  It's either this one or the 88-year-old Eagle Scout.  I like that one.  But this one is really, really good.  Listen to this.  It was in the suspect's top floor apartment.  Police found her stepfather bound, gagged, and his penis cut off.  Ow!  Wow.  They suspect foul play.  Oof.  Wow.  Severed schmeckle.  That's got to hurt.  Yeah.  Listen.  I don't care who you are.  But listen to this.  And they don't really...  I guess they leave it for you to figure out. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  I like stories like that.  Cut off.  Police believe 55-year-old Eric Goodrich was murdered by his 26-year-old stepdaughter  as an act of revenge for sexual abuse when she was a girl.  People who live in the Arvorn, Queens neighborhood where it happened are stunned at the brutality  of the killing, but cops say it was a murder with a message.  They found chilling notes left behind by the woman.  One said, he wrecked my life.  At first I blamed myself.  Now I know it's not my fault. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Not the good version, unfortunately.  No.  Yeah.  We're missing a detail on this version of the story.  Well, what I heard on the way in, I heard this story when I was listening to the news  on the way in, and I heard he was found castrated.  And the cause of death, they said, could be strangulation or he may have choked because  something was lodged in his throat.  And they would not say on the news what it was.  Yet they did say that a part of him had been cut off. 
[02:00:30]  And he may have choked to death.  And if you had been the victim of sexual assault from this guy, what better thing to do with  what you've cut off than perhaps serve it up to him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  She got mad.  Then she got even.  Yep.  Wow.  The sound to the lambs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what is that?  Don't pull that out with the tweezers.  Clarice.  A Russian composer, Vladimir Kachikakov.  You'll have some beautiful music. 
[02:01:00]  Good old Otto.  Wow.  And then we got this cute little story.  This is one of those.  Is it Feel Good Story Monday?  It is Feel Good Story Monday.  This is a Feel Good Story.  And we got one just before we get off the air here.  Well, a long overdue award for a Boy Scout in Florida.  That's right.  The honoree had to wait 70 years to officially become.  Wait, seven years?  So he was, what, 14?  What?  70 years.  70.  You know who this should be a good story for? 
[02:01:30]  Feel Good for a mortician.  Yeah.  Because this Eagle Scout will be visiting him shortly.  And I hope they carry him in that faggoty little Boy Scout outfit.  Stupid uniform.  With his little short shorts.  Little Eagle thing tighter.  I'm an Eagle Scout.  And he's, you know, he's 70 years old,  so those little shorts don't really contain things when you're 70.  Just that gravity-riddled, liver-spotted thing coming down to his knee.  I was in the Cub Scouts pretty much. 
[02:02:00]  A lot of the guys in grammar school were in the Cub Scouts.  That's adorable.  Yeah.  But then when they moved to the next level,  what was the next level after Boy Scout?  Wee Blows?  No, wait.  Almost.  No, I was in the Cub Scouts.  So that's the really little old fellas.  I think then the Boy Scouts.  All right.  That's when I even realized this is creepy.  Cub Scouts, it was questionable.  Boy Scouts, creepy. 
[02:02:30]  Eagle Scout, now something's going on.  For me, it went right because Wee Blows was the young ones.  It went to Wee Blows, Cub Scouts, right into the Hitler Youth.  I just decided to bypass any of the good Boy Scouts.  Wait, where was Wee Blows?  I don't know.  Wee Blows.  Oh, Wee Blows?  They were here on Long Island.  I was never a Wee Blow.  We used to make fun of the Wee Blows.  Even as kids, we knew that name.  There was something to it.  That was just make fun-able.  All I know is if you were part of the Cub Scouts,  you know, I don't know.  You got to eat cookies and go on little field trips. 
[02:03:00]  The dumb place.  Cancel things out of your memory forever.  Yeah.  But then when we got to Eagle Scouts,  I was like, what are you doing?  Hanging around too long.  Let's stop.  Yeah.  That's true.  What happened on your trip?  I don't know.  Well, we went camping.  Next thing you know, I'm 17.  All right.  Here's the feel-good story once again.  We'll start from the beginning.  Because the news reporter has to say,  a boy.  A boy finally realized it was a dream.  You know?  Listen to this.  Well, a long-overdue award for a Boy Scout in Florida. 
[02:03:30]  That's right.  The honoree had to wait 70 years  to officially become an Eagle Scout.  Fellow Boy Scouts were on hand  to give 88-year-old Walter Hart  his special distinction.  He completed all the requirements  to become an Eagle Scout,  but never got his award.  That's because he enlisted in the Navy.  It's got to be said,  this will make a lot of people laugh.  It's coming in like crazy.  I'll take Ricky's from Massachusetts.  It's good to see Howard getting press again. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, so he was in the military,  and that's why he couldn't get his award?  Wait a minute.  How old are you when you get in the...  I don't know.  ...distinction.  He completed all the requirements  to become an Eagle Scout,  but never got his award.  That's because he enlisted in the Navy  and spent years at sea during World War II.  Hart first joined the Cub Scouts back in 1928.  Love to make fun of the guys.  A World War II vet.  That's just it, though.  Why would you go from World War II vet 
[02:04:30]  to Eagle Scout?  Who cares if you got your award?  You know, you're 70 years old,  you've been through World War II,  and you care about an award  on an Eagle Scout uniform?  And you're going to put your Eagle Scout badges  right next to your purple heart?  Yeah.  Next to your medals for, you know,  doing horrific things to the enemy?  Yeah.  What are those little...  He's got his flashlight up to his face.  And then I'm going to tell the kids a horror story.  That was a good one you told about the hook.  You really got me at the end of that one, 
[02:05:00]  but here's mine.  So, we all land on a place called Iwo Jima.  And we step out of our landing craft,  and all of a sudden, the Japs come after us.  And like that marshmallow you're eating, Mikey,  I flamed one up as he ran out of a cave.  And his screaming, horrible body  came running out in flames.  So, Joe, my buddy, machine-gunned him in half.  All you could hear were the screams of horror. 
[02:05:30]  Let me tell you about the time  I killed one with his own samurai sword.  I pulled it out and just hacked at his face  so there was nothing left.  But see that burger you're eating?  Billy, it looked like that.  That was his face.  Your hamburger.  I don't want any more stories.  You're scaring me.  That's funny shit.  Dude, I know.  Can you picture him there with the flashlight? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  And there we were on the landing craft.  I saw my buddy Jenkins right next to me,  but he exploded.  See, the beach was all armed.  There were a bunch of Japs there with big guns.  They cut us down.  Did you ever see your best friend's heart  when it's on your face?  I don't want to tell a story.  And they're sitting around the campfire,  you know, toasting the marshmallows there, Anthony.  Who wants to make s'mores?  That reminds me of when my buddy got his guts blown out. 
[02:06:30]  It looks like when you squish a s'more,  his brains came out like the white stuff,  his entrails like the chocolate,  and his bones were like graham crackers.  I'm afraid.  Shut up.  I got my badge.  Someday you might have to go to war and die.  Hey, just like being at war, right? 
[02:07:00]  Let me see your medal.  That's nice.  No, this is my purple heart.  I got it for being stabbed by a kraut.  Let's see the badge you got over there, Billy.  Yeah.  What's that badge?  Tying a knot?  That's cute.  Let me point out what this one was for.  This one was for hacking the arms off of babies that had just been inoculated.  Did I ever show you my ear necklace? 
[02:07:30]  What the hell?  That's fun.  Oh, you boys are making a camp here.  Let me tell you about a camp we liberated once.  That was a sight to see.  Eat up, boys, because these people I saw hadn't eaten in quite some time.  You Jewish boys might want to hear this story.  Why does he care?  Hey, a couple things real fast.  Otto and George playing Showboat Hotel and Casino. 
[02:08:00]  September 22nd.  September 22nd.  2007.  One show.  Our listeners aren't going to remember, so check out your website.  Okay.  Yeah, OttoandGeorge.com.  Dot com.  Okay.  And we'll see you Saturday as part of the virus tour as we go to Detroit.  That's the next stop.  Tickets still available, and if you've got a military ID, you get them free.  Tracy, the new PD here in New York, she wrote me a communique.  We got Korn doing a hostile takeover today here in New York City from 3 to 7.  A lot of Korn fans out there.  Hostile.  And if you're not in the New York area, you want to listen to this, 923krock.com. 
[02:08:30]  You can check that out.  And you can also check out the Opie and Anthony page on 923krock.com.  Like I've said many times, Al Dukes is doing a great show recap or rundown, whatever.  Complete with links and stuff of all the things we've talked about today.  So it's very, very good.  Worth checking out.  And then Korn's doing a free, what, concert tomorrow at 6 p.m. at South Street Seaport.  Oh, that's really cool.  Woo.  That's really cool here in New York.  If you're in the area, check that out as well.  Okay?  All right. 
[02:09:00]  Friday, I'm doing a signing in Detroit.  Borders on Birmingham, Woodward Avenue in Birmingham, if you know where that is, 730.  Saturday, come down, and then Saturday we're doing a new show in Detroit, and it's going  to be a whole thing in Detroit.  Absolutely.  In Detroit.  In Detroit there.  Hey, if you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day, Otto.  You did a great job, and you're hanging, right?  Thanks, Hope.  Yeah, absolutely.  Now you get to curse.  Yeah.  I can't.  Otto?  Did they have to talk about it? 
[02:09:30]  It's close, but who knows?  Who cares?  Who knows?  Otto will be cursing with us in a few minutes.  Have a great day. 
[02:10:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show, XM Satellite Radio.  We got Otto and George in studio.  Yeah.  Really fast, in between the two shows, Ant and I have to run down the hall.  It never ends, and do like all sorts of production, and then run back in here and start the XM  show.  Yeah, that's replace the walkover.  And sometimes, yeah, yeah.  Pretty much replace the walkover as us now doing commercials. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, instead maybe just having us relax for five minutes, then we can get on maybe slightly  earlier.  It's all sorts of production that we have to do.  And today, I kind of lost my mind in Tim's studio, because one of the radio stations  sent in a script.  Yeah.  We love scripts, by the way.  And these are our favoritest.  Yeah.  Favoritest kind of scripts.  I mean, Ant and I barely like doing a script for each other while we're in the same room,  but some of these stations, they send a script where you don't even talk to the other person. 
[02:11:00]  It's the one-sided conversation script.  So you do your part.  You hear them in every market, and you'll hear like the same one in another market.  And you'll hear the same conversation, and the person will be giving the same answers,  but it'll be a different DJ.  Right.  Doing the questions and talking to this person, because they just splice it together with  one call from her.  Oh.  What's that?  What's that?  Excuse me?  What's that?  Phone call.  What's that?  Phone call.  Hello.  From who the fucking...  The Red October?  Hi.  How you doing? 
[02:11:30]  Good.  Yeah.  It's...  It's on?  Who the fuck is on that fucking phone?  That's Jim Norton, by the way.  Who the fuck is that?  He's on the air cursing.  Yeah.  Um, so, uh, the alarm was on?  Oh.  Oops.  What alarm?  What happened?  Oh, it is.  Okay.  Um, hold on.  Give the code out real quick.  Yeah, hold on.  Give the code.  The code is CUNT PAINTER.  Painters are cunts. 
[02:12:00]  Painters are cunts.  You love cuck!  That made me happy.  All right, we lost Dan.  So, uh...  He's having a problem at home.  Huh?  He's having a problem.  Yeah, he's having a little problem at home.  So, uh, one of these stations, they sent a script in.  The one-sided interview.  It's so hokey.  And, uh, I did my part.  Somehow, I guess I agreed to this.  I know I would never agree to this.  And I guess I was interviewing Shannon Elizabeth from the American Pie movies. 
[02:12:30]  And she's, like, now a spokesperson for some Vegas adventure, some poker thing.  She's in a movie called Deal with, uh, Burt Reynolds, Brett Harrison, and Jennifer Tilly.  And because it's some kind of, like, Vegas movie, she's also doing something with Vegas.  And this is a commercial.  And so, I gotta make believe that I'm just interviewing her casually.  And she just so happens to talk about this new, you know, venture she's doing.  Like an infomercial. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  This is the way those awful, uh, infomercials are done.  And, uh, tell us all about the thing.  And then you just go into some fucking awful dissertation about a product.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  All good?  Oops.  Well, what happened?  Got my wallpaper guy coming over.  And, uh, apparently, the alarm was set.  Oh, boy.  And as he walked in the door, uh, my savage alarm system went off.  Oh, boy.  It's not supposed to alert when, uh, when painters come in. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  It's just supposed to alert when savages come in.  What is, I can't be getting calls.  I'm working.  This is my job.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, who's this?  He's busy, you fucking dumb.  Hey, I heard a cunt on the phone.  Hey, cunt.  He's got a cunt on the phone.  He's busy, bitch.  Hey, cunt.  You fucking dumb bitch.  Hey, cunt.  And let me tell you, I've gotten calls when stuff like that has been yelled. 
[02:14:00]  It's really embarrassing.  Yeah.  You think?  They can't not hear it.  They can't not hear cunt being yelled at them.  Why are your co-workers yelling cunt?  Well, they're on the radio.  I understand that.  Why are they yelling cunt?  He fled the room.  Yeah, well.  So, anyway, the infomercial.  Yes.  And, you know, the big movie star doesn't have time to be on the phone with, like, a shock  jock.  So, you do your part.  She does hers.  And it's supposed to sound natural.  Who's this broad?  Shannon Elizabeth from the American Pie.  That broad. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, nice.  Who's very naked right next to you now, Jimmy.  Big tits.  Oh.  With the big, heavy bosoms.  Yeah.  She wasn't happy.  No.  She wasn't happy at the language.  Who's she?  The alarm bitch?  Yeah.  She's the alarm bitch.  Apparently, the police have been dispatched.  Nice.  And they shall be going to my, my painter is going to be a, he's going to have some explaining  to do.  That's good.  You want to know the alarm works?  Yeah, I do want to know it works.  Nobody's robbing you.  It's good to know the system's in place.  I don't think anyone's robbing me.  Police are alerted. 
[02:15:00]  A lady on the phone calls you.  I'm punching it.  I'm punching my home up right now on, go to mypc.com.  And I'm looking in now.  I'm waiting to see the cops come in my house.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, there's, see, there's the guy that set the alarm off.  Wait, let me see.  He doesn't know I'm watching them.  Can you pout?  No, I can't.  It's only on this screen.  Hold on.  We'll wait till the cops come.  You guys are going to have some explaining to do.  That's a good camera, dude.  Oh, yeah.  What is that guy?  Send in those three new men. 
[02:15:30]  See, these are the guys that are doing my wallpaper.  I'm able to watch them from here.  Wow.  Why are you taking your TV out?  See, that's why I watch.  You're like a fucking Bond villain.  They don't know.  See, and I can pan around.  Even from here, I could pan around the house and take a look, see at what's going on.  Yeah.  And then after they finish, you drop them into a shark tank.  Oh, who is that?  Where are you going? 
[02:16:00]  You don't have any business in here.  Yeah.  Who's that guy?  You got no business going over there.  What are you doing over there?  How great would it be if you walked out of a pair of your underwear over his face and a fucking  rod tenting out his painter shorts.  Oh, good.  I smelled your Italian bag.  Where is he?  Look, he knows I'm following him.  Look, look, he's freaking out now because I'm following him with the camera.  Hmm.  Look at his.  Those are painters?  Great.  Looks like a criminal. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Look like a tennis instructor or something.  No kidding.  Keep an eye on you.  Yeah.  Keep an eye on them.  Italian.  That is a very nice camera.  Wait until the cops come.  Huh?  Jesus.  I can't believe the cops are going to come.  That's all.  Let us know when the cops show up.  All right.  So they sent this script.  I had to talk to Shannon Elizabeth, even though I'm not really talking to her.  And the language in this script is just dumb stuff I would never say.  Yeah, because they don't word it for you.  They word it for just anybody. 
[02:17:00]  I kind of lost my mind.  So to give this a reference point, why don't you guys do the script?  Oh, we're going to do it.  Do we have both sides?  Wait, we need another copy of this, actually.  Do we have both sides of the conversation?  Because I'm just doing my lines, losing my mind here.  Who are you going to be?  Well, Jimmy obviously should be Shannon.  Shannon Elizabeth?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That'd be nice.  Okay.  All right, we'll get another script.  And this is how it's supposed to go.  Yeah.  And do it like, you know.  Right.  Of course.  I've done plenty of these one-sided conversations, stupid commercials. 
[02:17:30]  They're ridiculous.  They're the worst, because you sound out of place.  I love hearing them, though, from other jocks on the air, because then you go, it's like,  ah, it's the one-sided commercial.  And I don't know what I did right, because I'm the one that has to do these.  So you must have done one, and they hated you.  Because that's how it usually works.  I did a great one with that old bag that used to be on, oh, the cops might be there,  with the old bag that used to be on Charlie's Angels.  Charlie's Angels?  For like a minute.  Tanya Roberts.  Tanya Roberts. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, I did one with her.  Well, they didn't like it, because now I have to do the ones with Tanya Roberts.  All right, do the script real fast.  Okay.  And we'll play the host.  Oh, big.  And Jimmy will play Shannon Elizabeth.  Okay.  Hey, everybody.  You're not going to believe who I have on the phone right now.  I can't believe it myself.  It's the stunning Shannon Elizabeth.  How are you doing, darling?  I'm okay, but my cunt itches.  Oh, great.  Now, you're starring in a movie with Burt Reynolds, Brett Harrison, and Jennifer Tilly called Deal. 
[02:18:30]  Now, before we get started, I've got to tell you, I love your movies.  Now, you've gotten this poker career thing going on.  Who gives a shit?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Now, you've combined your passion for poker and acting in Deal.  Tell us about the movie.  What's it like?  Well, I take a big shit in Burt Reynolds' wig, and then I finger myself.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It centers around a young Yale senior, Alex, who's really not a good actor, but apparently 
[02:19:00]  he's a faggot, and he's been sucking the producer's dick.  And he's one of these online poker players.  He's self-taught.  He's cocky.  He kind of thinks he knows everything, and he loses very quickly.  Oh.  Oh.  And Burt Reynolds' character, well, he plays Tommy Vincent.  He's an old poker pro, and he sees, like, Alex playing, and he wants to take him under  his wing and teach him everything, because he sees there's a lot of potential there.  So, well, you know, he helps make it all the way to the finals in Vegas, and it really,  really is a piece of shit, Phil. 
[02:19:30]  I love some Burt Reynolds.  Yeah.  I went online and saw the trailer.  It looks like a lot of fun.  Very exciting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  And I got something else exciting for you.  Oh, what's that?  For any of the couples out there listening to you today and you want to see the movie  Deal, we're inviting them to Vegas for our September 17th premiere.  Cool.  Except airfare won't be provided.  We had two news helicopters, but that didn't work out particularly well.  Really?  Yeah.  They bumped heads.  Ha ha.  LOL. 
[02:20:00]  Ha ha.  All right, Shannon.  Let me see if I got this right.  You've invited all the couples listening right now for a no-strings-attached romantic getaway  to Las Vegas?  Fine.  Why don't you just do the whole thing, shit dick?  Oh.  Right now.  And I would give them the number.  Okay.  I've already said this.  Two VIP tickets, Jew.  VIP treatment.  Red carpet.  What else do you want, Jaime?  Ha ha.  All right.  The beautiful and talented Shannon Elizabeth, thank you so much for taking, darling, thank 
[02:20:30]  you so much, darling, for taking the time to tell us about this incredible offer.  You still here?  I told you to go fuck your mother.  Bing, bye, pole, bing.  Let's see.  This promotion is sponsored by Tahiti Village.  Yeah, see.  Is it?  Now, Anthony did all the lines that I was supposed to do.  Right.  Now, this isn't going to do it justice, because Jimmy just made it into something better.  No, no, no.  You got to hear the explosive, ridiculous temper on Opie.  Well, I saw, how are you doing, darling, and I lost my mind. 
[02:21:00]  Lost it at the first line.  Hey, how cool is this?  Hey, how cool is this?  Look who we have on the phone right now.  See, okay, you were trying at first to actually do it.  Right, right, right, right.  You were trying.  Hey, look who we have on the phone.  Nobody.  Right, nobody.  I'm just doing my lines.  I figured I would just give it the old college try to just get it over with, but then I saw  darling, and then it just took on a life of its own.  How cool is this?  Look who we have on the phone right now.  It's the stunning.  Hey, wow.  How cool is this? 
[02:21:30]  We got.  This is so stupid.  So stupid.  I'm keeping it under control.  Yeah.  I am.  I just said stupid under my breath.  I'm going to continue.  But how is that under control when you said stupid before the first line was out?  That's not control.  And I didn't even see the word darling yet.  Darling?  I just know these things are stupid because they never sound good.  Where they like, you do your lines, and they do their lines from another city, and  then some engineer puts it together, and it's supposed to sound like a natural conversation. 
[02:22:00]  Do we have her lines?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think so, because we have to send this off to them.  And then I saw darling.  Here we go.  Oh, wow.  This is really cool.  Look who we have on the phone right now.  It's the stunning Shannon Elizabeth.  How are you, darling?  I wouldn't say fucking darling.  How are you, darling?  Send this fucking thing back to them.  I would never say fucking how are you doing, darling. 
[02:22:30]  Only people over the age of 60 say how are you doing, darling.  Hey there, foxy lady.  Hey, Shannon, how are you doing?  That's how a guy in his late 20s talks.  Late 20s.  You tool.  Keeping that illusion alive. 
[02:23:00]  Barely talks.  How are you doing, darling?  Ah, can I do it?  Hmm.  I'm good.  How are you?  Oh, I'm great.  Now you're starring in a new movie with Burt Reynolds, Brett Harrison, and Jennifer Tilly called Deal.  Now, before we get started, got to tell you, I love your movies.  Now you've got this big poker career thing going on, huh?  You can just hear the anger.  Now you've got this big poker career thing going on, huh?  Because I'm thinking of the phone call I'm going to have after the show today. 
[02:23:30]  I've got this big poker career thing going on, huh?  Fucking for my team.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  How do you fucking say, hmm?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I'll go with that one.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Now you've combined your passion for poker and acting and deal.  Tell us about the movie.  What's it like?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Again with, hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm. 
[02:24:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Wow.  This fucking interview was done originally with Carl from Sling Blade.  So you like pottied meat in a can.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  There's peckers in there.  So you like the way I talk and I like the way you talk.  Queer funny, not ha-ha funny.  So what are you going to do with that?  I aims to kill you with it.  They type out, mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Like any guy would go, mm-hmm. 
[02:24:30]  Mm-hmm.  Tell me more.  If I go, could I get some of them French fried potatoes?  Potatoes.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  Oh, this next line's great.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I love some Burt Reynolds.  Oh, yeah.  I went online and saw the trailer.  It looks like a lot of fun.  Very exciting.  Ooh! 
[02:25:00]  What's that?  You can't be serious.  The anger was pulled out of me.  They will not accept this, Reed.  Like, they write, ooh, what's that?  Who the fuck would go, ooh, what's that?  Unless it's Jimmy fucking around.  Titing.  Ooh!  What's that?  I would never say, ooh, what's that?  Cocksucker. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, this line's beautiful after she explains the movie, blah, blah, blah.  Cool.  Really?  Really?  With exclamation points and everything, because I'm so excited by what she just said prior to what I said.  All right, Sean, let me see if I got this right.  You just invited all the couples listening right now for a no-strings-attached romantic getaway to Las Vegas.  Oh?  Or is it, oh?  Oh! 
[02:26:00]  Okay!  All right, the beautiful and talented Shannon Elizabeth.  Thank you so much, darling.  Fuck you!  I would never say darling!  Thank you so much, darling, for taking the time.  Tell us about this incredible offer.  For, wait.  Thank you so much, darling, for taking the time to tell us about this incredible offer.  They don't even fucking proofread before they send this shit down.  Is that Don on the phone? 
[02:26:30]  This promotion is sponsored by Tahiti Village.  There you go.  Send that off to these cocksuckers.  How great would it be if they used that one?  Oh, yeah.  They'd get a lot of calls to their number.  And yes, Redding, I did say exclamation point.  I was a little excited.  Who needs an L?  You're busy.  Here's what I predict they do.  What?  They take the bit of me and Jimmy going back and forth, cut all my parts out, and send that.  Oh, I know. 
[02:27:00]  That's what they're going to do.  Because you did yours right.  You did it right.  Because I was doing an example of how the hacky jock is supposed to do it.  I understand.  And now that's the one that's going to get used, and I'm going to sound like a tool.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Hey, darling.  Darling?  I was going to say darling.  Who the fuck would write darling?  Hey there, little lady.  Little lady.  Darling?  When was the last time you used the word darling?  Darling.  A week and a half.  Hmm.  Oh.  I only say that when I talk dirty. 
[02:27:30]  I'm like, suck it, darling.  Darling?  Take this in your shitter.  Tell them about the discount, Harry.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, shut up.  Is that Shannon Elizabeth right there?  Yeah.  Holy mother of Christ.  And those are real, right?  She didn't have any work done.  Oh, those are real?  No.  Impossible.  Those are real.  Yeah.  She's young there, man.  How about tapering a log into my mouth, darling?  Darling?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, darling.  She's lovely.  Yeah.  Those are like perfect.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  Oof.  All right.  Hey, partner.  How's the deal you got going?  Hey, Slim.  Hey, got to pull Slim.  All right.  Speaking of commercial reads, this kind of segues nicely into the Robert De Niro thing we got today.  Huh?  Robert De Niro feels he was energetic enough in this outtake for a Tribeca film read.  Hmm.  This is great.  Listen to this.  When we created Tribeca, we wanted to capture all the emotion, all the energy, and all the power of a movie. 
[02:28:30]  See for yourself.  Tuesday on Fox.  I'll see that.  Do another?  No.  Huh?  He's just...  That's an E-Rock...  Remember when E-Rock Friday or Thursday was trying to do like the exciting jock thing,  and he was just kind of blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah.  He finally got it right.  But this is...  That is a lackluster, unenergetic read.  Well, there's really no energy, and they call him out on not having energy. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah, listen to this.  Do another?  He goes, that's all right.  One more.  Good.  Good.  I'm sorry.  I got...  That's energetic.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Yes.  Excuse me.  No.  A little bit.  Wow.  No.  Sorry.  I'm not selling cars, okay?  Wow.  Holy shit.  Is that great?  You look like a bunch of junkies.  Yeah.  No, no.  You did.  You did. 
[02:29:30]  A little bit.  Wow.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Wow.  He got pissed quickly.  Well, he's fucking De Niro, and some fucking soundboard guy is telling him how to act.  The guy was right, but still.  But he was completely right.  Let me hear his delivery again.  Listen to the end when he goes on Fox or something.  It's dry nothing.  Don't correct the star of Bullwinkle.  He knows what he's doing.  Bullwinkle?  Fucking shithead.  Good.  Fuck it.  Good.  You're right.  Yeah.  You created Tribeca.  Yeah.  You wanted to capture all the emotion, all the energy, and all the power of a movie. 
[02:30:00]  See for yourself.  Tuesday on Fox.  I'm going to open his hole like this.  Do another?  See for yourself.  Tuesday on Fox.  Wow.  Yeah.  You got to like...  You got to like...  He doesn't have to go, you know, see for yourself.  Tuesday on Fox.  Yeah, but you got to give it just slightly a little more.  Something.  He's De Niro, though.  Just De Niro doing that is enough.  It's true.  Yeah, it's true.  Just to get the man...  Is that what he's thinking, though?  Is that what he's fucking thinking?  I'm De Niro.  I can do it however I want?  Yeah.  Probably not.  It's probably just the way he did it.  Oh, stop.  Go screw. 
[02:30:30]  These guys aren't used to like commercial.  They do whatever they feel in like in a moment.  Yeah.  Like you don't tell De Niro what to do.  Ah.  Like you know...  William Shatner...  Who told me that William Shatner...  Someone tried to direct William Shatner?  Oh, really?  Yeah, like in a commercial and he said, don't tell me.  Stop heralding actors like it's such a fucking hard thing to do.  Without Scorsese and the writer of Taxi Driver, he'd be delivering pizzas.  It's not that big a deal.  Well, still, though.  Like someone told Shatner...  Well, all acting is is emoting.  We all have every emotion in us that he shows on the screen. 
[02:31:00]  We all have those emotions.  It's not a big fucking deal.  It's reading what the writer wrote and then having a director tell you how to present it.  Yeah, and 57 tries to get it right.  Fuck him.  Fuck him buying up half the city.  Nice.  Hey, Otto, who's your friend over there?  My dear friend Kenny Michaels, a great performer.  Ooh.  He looks shot.  We do a lot of gigs together.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah.  A lot of gigs.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Yeah.  Tuesday.  I was talking about bombing before. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  I'm on the radio now.  Great.  God, what a fucking prima donna.  I'll say it.  He said two things.  Is there any...  I know.  I got to say more.  He's taking up all the mic time.  Give him a chance, man.  I hear he does the Sopranos and stuff.  Yeah.  You do Sopranos voices?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Like who?  Pauly and Silvio.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  You got to stand up and do fucking...  Oh, he does the walk of that faggot guy, Johnny Cakes.  I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[02:32:00]  You can't see that on the radio.  It doesn't matter.  We'll laugh.  Let's go.  Hold on.  Get a microphone.  Can we stand up?  Yeah.  Let's see the Johnny Cakes walk.  Let's see if we can get that mic turned up for you.  Here comes the show.  Here comes the show.  All right.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You want to see the Vito walk?  Yeah.  Let's see the Vito walk.  Vito walk's good.  That was the Vito walk.  All right.  Sorry for the radio, people, but Jesus Christ.  That was pretty funny.  Wait.  What about the Johnny Cakes walk? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  That's the Vito, yeah.  Oh.  What am I saying?  Vito.  What am I saying?  You're shy.  Yeah.  Sorry.  And that will let you do some voices of something.  Yeah.  I got your voice.  Let me just...  Do more, you fuck.  Come on, man.  Let me...  Not look.  There's people in Finland.  What are my car salesmen?  Yeah.  What are my selling cars?  Wow.  He got mad that fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I need more energy.  Meet the fuckers.  Can you put that on the thing?  Meet the fuckers.  Yeah.  Oh, he's up.  Wasn't that the highest grossing comedy ever in the history of the world? 
[02:33:00]  Let's hope so.  Analyze this.  Analyze that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meet the fuckers was...  Analyze your take on that last fucking read, douchebag.  It stunk.  Fucking Barbra Streisand.  The cocksucker's got a film festival.  I'm standing here with my dick in my hand.  Holy shit.  That's pretty good.  It's fucking bulls.  Wow.  That's pretty good, man.  That's good.  It's all right.  It's awkward.  No, don't worry about it.  Why is it awkward?  How do you think I feel with a puppet?  Yeah.  Fucking Ana's got a puppet next to him.  Do it with you, too.  I see how a white girl could fall for him.  He got these impersonations. 
[02:33:30]  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  And what?  Silvio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Silvio's sitting down.  It's just hunched and...  I don't know.  Maybe...  I don't know.  Bona Fatou.  Bona Fatou.  That's funny.  Tony's the hard one to do, though, right?  Yeah.  Well, Tony, it's like you have to talk in the back of your mouth.  It's like...  It's over here. 
[02:34:00]  You know, that kind of a thing.  I'm working on that one.  That's not easy to do.  Yeah.  Hey, we...  E-Rock found the Orson Welles crap.  Oh, you want to talk about a guy that can't fucking take direction.  Oh.  Have you heard the Orson Welles crap?  No, is that for the wine commercial or something?  This he was doing for everything from...  At the end of his career, they would throw him in a studio, his big, fat fucking ass,  and he would do anything.  Yeah.  He'd do commercials and think he was still this great actor. 
[02:34:30]  I saw a commercial for...  You might be able to find this online somewhere.  It's a kid's game called The Fucking Castle or something like that, and he's like, you  move your players with the roll of each dice, and you...  It's a fucking kid game, you dummy.  He was selling some cheap wine that the Shines drank out of, like, a paper bag, and he was  like, we'll sell no wine before it's time.  Before it's time.  Are the liquor stores open?  It's time.  It's time.  It's time.  Paul Ma-San. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Paul Ma-San.  That's some cheap, nasty shit.  He's holding up.  It was the big jug.  Yeah.  That you'd get.  You're also available in boxes.  Oh, God.  Really?  Yeah.  But he shouldn't, you know, he shouldn't be told how to find it.  He made one brilliant movie.  Yeah, true.  One.  Rice ready in three moments.  And the rest of his time was spent on crappy game shows.  I don't know.  And those fucking Dean Martin roasts.  Was Sinister Cain that good?  I thought that...  I don't know.  When I saw it... 
[02:35:30]  Well, cinematography.  Other than that, what was...  You know, it didn't grab me by...  It was absolutely right.  I'd rather watch White Heat with James Cagney any fucking day.  Yeah.  You know, any of those Warner Brothers gangster movies are better than that.  Yeah.  I saw that.  It was like...  I don't...  It was overrated.  It's laborious.  The cinematography was great.  It was very...  Yeah.  The lighting and shadows.  Yeah.  To the sled.  I don't know.  Which one...  You ruined the fucking movie.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Good.  The whole movie's ruined. 
[02:36:00]  Which one...  You ruined.  Which Orson Welles do you want to hear?  We got three.  We also got Michael Jordan outtakes from...  His Gatorade commercial.  No more of De Niro though?  He sounded real cranky.  I was only one.  I don't remember the Jordan one.  Nah.  Jordan one ain't that good.  The Michael Jordan one is...  He's trying to do the slug line and they keep saying, can you give more life to him?  And he does it the same way for over a minute.  Just be part of the conversation.  It's cool.  I like that.  I'm giving it direction.  What do I say?  What do I...  Ah, just wait till you can jump in.  I don't need more energy.  Jump right in. 
[02:36:30]  That's awesome.  We're still going to catch his deli.  Don't worry.  He whispers with seven microphones around him.  Yeah.  I thought you were kidding or you were seriously whispering.  I'm serious.  That was hysterical.  That was the fucking worst information.  I thought Otto was joking into the mic on purpose.  I flunked the CIA.  What can I tell you?  Oh my God.  Pushed the mic aside.  Leaned over into his mic.  You just whispered to two continents.  Shut up. 
[02:37:00]  That is hilarious.  Supporting a friend.  I know.  Just be part of the conversation.  Keep that under your hat.  Keep it under your hat.  Try to act natural.  This is your cocky speaking.  Try to act natural.  I suck enough.  That is all.  That is all.  Just try to be part of the conversation.  Over.  Try not to suck internationally.  Oh my God.  KT12 to KT01.  Don't let him see a swack.  He didn't even whisper it.  Like I had the headphones on.  I heard. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  Well.  Everybody heard it.  All right.  Let's stop.  Wait.  Can we.  What's yours?  I'm an idiot.  Hold on.  Can we go back and grab that in a minute?  Which one?  What?  Otto's Whisper.  Oh yeah.  I thought he was kidding.  Fuck your mother.  Catch cancer.  Please tell me we have that.  I'm obsessed with it.  All right.  Here we go.  What's Orson Welles' the drunk champagne?  He's drunk trying to do a commercial for champagne.  Oh yeah.  Let's listen to this one.  Okay.  I don't know if I remember this one. 
[02:38:00]  Orson Welles.  With overlap.  Action feed.  Action Orson, please.  Did you just do anything?  No.  Sorry.  Okay.  Keep going rolling.  102 take two.  Ah.  The French champagne.  Wow.  Has always been celebrated for its excellence. 
[02:38:30]  Jesus.  There's a California champagne by Paul Masson.  Wow.  Inspired by that same French excellence.  It's fermented in a bottle and lights the best French champagne.  Wow.  It's vintage dated.  So Paul Masson.  102 take three.  Action, please.  Ah.  The French champagne.  Oh, Rachel.  You're coming back.  Paul Masson champagne. 
[02:39:00]  Mr. Faber-Sham.  I want Paul Masson.  Faber-Sham.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  He is hammered.  Wow.  Yeah, go back a little bit.  He is sauced.  All right.  102 take three.  It's hysterical.  Action, please.  Ah.  Whoa, that's good weed.  There is a California champagne by Paul Masson. 
[02:39:30]  Inspired by that same French excellence.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  Clear the field.  You got pitch pipe nothing?  Pitch pipe.  Pitch pipe.  What's the matter, Rerock?  Drinking some Paul Masson.  Why is it crapping out, man?  102 take three. 
[02:40:00]  Action, please.  Wow.  Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.  Wow.  There is a California champagne by Paul Masson.  Inspired by that same French excellence, it's fermented in the bottle and like the best  French champagne, it's vintage, dated.  So Paul Masson's.  Forster Brooks.  Wow.  That was, wow.  Yeah.  I like how he had a, meh, meh, meh, meh. 
[02:40:30]  Hum, na, hum, na, hum, na, hum, na, hum, na.  Wow.  I'm sure that Paul Masson California champagne was just as good as any French champagne you  could get.  Look.  Mr. Thrifty champagne.  Oh.  What's the most swell?  Mr. Thrifty.  Shines.  What's the?  What's the other one?  Take directions from one person.  Is that the famous one we've done many times with the peas? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, I love that one.  Have you ever heard the frozen peas one?  No.  The frozen fish sticks from the fjords.  The frozen fjords.  You've never heard that?  We should play Ferrado then.  Really?  Yeah.  Gotta hear this.  This is the gift.  This is Orson Welles too?  Yeah.  This is classic.  It's in England too, I think.  Just being obnoxious.  Starts yelling at it.  This poor board op.  You just know he wants to fucking shoot him.  Really?  You guys making like probably three bucks an hour back then.  I did it right the first time.  Yeah.  Did you?  Arrogant fat man.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of people getting together. 
[02:41:30]  Good.  Could I have one more go, Orson, please?  Sorry.  What?  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Look, I'm not used to having more than one person in there.  One more word out of you and you go.  Hmm.  Is that clear?  Yes, sir.  I take directions from one person under protest, but from two I don't sit still.  Who the hell are you anyway?  No, I'm the engineer. 
[02:42:00]  Well, why the hell are you asking me for another one?  Well, I thought there was a slight bonk and I would just like to be safe.  Jesus.  What is a bonk?  You mind telling me what that is?  A bang from outside.  Oh.  A bang from outside.  Interference.  Can I see Mrs. Rogers for a minute, please? 
[02:42:30]  Yes, certainly.  Do you really mean that?  Yeah.  So, in other words, I'd start half a second later.  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow?  Isn't that the fun of it?  If you make it almost when that shot disappears, it'll make money.  I think it's so nice that you see a snow-covered field and say every July peas grow there.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July peas grow there.  We aren't even in the fields, you see? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, we aren't.  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  On what?  On in July.  I don't understand you, then.  When must, what must be over for July?  When we get out of that snowy field.  When I was out, we were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas when I said in July.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, always.  In July.  Pitchman.  I'm always past that.  You are.  Yes.  Well, that's about what I say in July.  Could you emphasize a bit in, in July? 
[02:43:30]  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  Sorry.  There's no known way of saying an English sentence in which you begin a sentence with  in and emphasize it.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July and I'll go down on you.  It's just idiotic if you'll forgive me.  That's just stupid.  In July.  I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July.  He's right.  Yeah.  Impossible.  Meaningless.  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to.  He isn't thinking. 
[02:44:00]  Wilson, can we just do one last one?  Yeah.  And it was my fault.  I said in July, if you can leave every July.  You didn't say it.  He said it.  Your friend.  Every July.  Who are you?  No, you don't really mean every July.  But that's a bad copy.  It's in July.  Of course it's every July.  There's too much directing around here.  Norway.  Fish fingers.  Fendus, Norway.  We know a certain fjord in Norway.  Near where the cod gather in great shoals. 
[02:44:30]  They're Janster Stangeland shit.  A fraction more on that shoals thing because you roll it around very nicely.  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time.  You don't know what I'm up against.  Because it's full of things that are only correct because they're grammatical.  But they're tough on the ear.  You see, this is a very wearying one.  It's unpleasant to read.  Unrewarding.  Unrewarding.  Give him some Bosco.  Because Fendus, freeze the cod at sea and then add a crumb crisp, cool crumb crisp coating. 
[02:45:00]  Filling fish sticks.  Yeah.  For 200,000 to read 10 words.  I think, no, because of the way it's written, you need to break it up because it's not as conversationally written.  What?  Take crumb out.  Take crumb out.  Good.  Here under protest is Beef Burgers.  We know a little place in the American Far West where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes. 
[02:45:30]  This is a lot of shit, you know that.  You want one more?  More on what beef?  You missed the first beef, actually, completely.  What do you mean, missed it?  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef, that's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before July.  Come on, fellas, you're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  Will you do this?  It's impossible.  Shakespeare is selling fish sticks.  War of the world is a frozen freeze. 
[02:46:00]  Wow.  That is hysterical.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  In July.  Overrated.  In July.  Opacity on that fat, dead fuck.  You could fucking, you could emphasize in July.  In July.  In July.  It's not hard.  In July.  In July.  Well, you're just being stupid.  Yeah.  In July.  Here, here's the last bit.  You want one more?  I'll do it.  More on what beef? 
[02:46:30]  You missed the first beef, actually, completely.  What do you mean, missed it?  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef.  That's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before July.  Come on, fellas, you're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare, where you do this.  It's impossible.  Oh, so you did six last year, and by far and away the best, and I know the reason.  The right reading for this is the one I'm giving it.  At the moment.  I spent 20 times more for you people than any other commercial I've ever made. 
[02:47:00]  You are such pests.  Now, what is it you want?  Nothing.  In your depths of your ignorance.  What is it you want?  Whatever it is you want, I can't deliver, because I just don't see it.  That was absolutely fine.  It really was.  You're giving me worth it.  No money is worth it.  No.  They must want to just fucking kill him.  It makes calling somebody an idiot sound really nice, though.  Yeah.  Dips of your ignorance.  Dips of your ignorance.  Idiocy.  You morons.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  And then they're all like, okay, no, that was good. 
[02:47:30]  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  They got to just agree with him.  Yeah, yeah, fuck it.  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah.  We stink.  We don't know this.  We've been engineering fucking spots forever, and you're a drunk.  Yeah.  But, go ahead.  In the frozen fjords, their cod gather in icy shoals, and it ends up in a cardboard box  square fish stick, you dummy.  Stupid fish stick.  He's got to make it sound all romantic, you know.  Billy Bob raises cattle and then shoots a boat through their head and chops them up into 
[02:48:00]  your chopped meat, into burger patties that come in a box.  He's selling shit, and he wants to be treated like he's fucking reciting Shakespeare.  He wants it to sound just like Citizen Kane, man.  Citizen cod, please.  Yes.  Rosebud burgers.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Do we have the...  What do we got?  I want to hear that whisper. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Oh, do we have it?  We got right here.  The whisper.  This is Otto giving his...  Otto is a jackhammer.  Be a good pal.  Being a good pal.  Being a good pal to...  Whisper in a helicopter.  What's your name again, sir?  Kenny.  Kenny.  All right.  Kenny...  Kenny's the comedian around here.  And Otto, why did you say this?  You just noticed that he was nervous?  You felt like...  I didn't want him to feel like, you know, he just was called in to do those voices because,  you know, he's as funny as anybody I know, you know?  Yeah.  So it's not like just wait there until you're asked something. 
[02:49:00]  You can just jump in and feel like that.  Otto knows how the deal goes.  It's your first time.  So he figured he'd subtly, very subtly whisper it in your ear.  Yeah.  Six million people heard me.  Yeah.  And it came out like this.  Give more life to him and he does it the same way for over a minute.  Just be part of the conversation.  That's classic.  Just be part of the conversation.  Yeah.  Part of the conversation.  Yeah.  Like I am right now.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[02:49:30]  In the depths of your ignorance.  In the depths of your ignorance.  Try and speak in when you feel like...  I wouldn't direct any living actor to whisper like that.  Oh.  I gotta hear that again.  Chime in, you stiff.  More likely when he does it the same way for over a minute.  Just be part of the conversation.  In a small Manhattan studio, a moron named Otto whispers in the ear of his friend.  Other shy boy who does voices. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, fuck.  Is the Barry White stuff worth playing?  He's letting nothing go.  It's great.  Of course not.  Assholes we are.  Are we going to break soon?  I just wanted to whisper that.  Alright, we'll continue with Otto and George and Kenny.  Thanks.  That's the best of yours.  O.P. and Anthony.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Shue. 
[02:50:30]  People are saying that the Barry White one is worth playing.  I don't remember the Barry White one.  We're playing outtakes right now.  Barry White.  Oh, also we have Big A calling in.  Big A.  Let me say hi to Big A.  Oh, baby.  What's up, Big A?  Yay.  Big A. 
[02:51:00]  Hi, O.P.  Anthony.  Hello, Jimmy.  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Big A.  Hi, Big A.  Why no energy when you call us?  But when Ron and Fez have you in, it's all, hey, I'm Big A.  I'm Big A.  I'm Big A.  Okay, I just woke up.  That's why.  Yeah, that morning thing will really take the life out of the radio.  Just woke up.  It's 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  I know.  Don't you have to work today?  12 o'clock.  Big A.  12. 
[02:51:30]  Last night.  It's Otto.  I missed you yesterday, but you can come to any other show.  Thanks, Lord.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah.  You're a good man.  Thanks, Lord.  He rolls over.  There's a crushed infant under him.  What's up, Big A?  No, I couldn't go last night because my dispatcher is a lesbian cunt.  Who is?  And promised I could get off early and then told me I couldn't. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Your boss or something.  Your boss.  Dispatcher, I think.  One of the men.  The stutter goes away a little bit when the rage comes out.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Stay angry.  That's why he's like choking some bitch and he's talking perfectly.  You fucking cunt.  Yeah.  Again, what happened?  She just said that she needed you last night?  Oh, yeah, because I was supposed to get off by 6 o'clock. 
[02:52:30]  I was supposed to be there by 8 o'clock.  And also the rage didn't help either.  And I couldn't go in.  And I was beyond pissed.  I mean, I was not happy.  Yeah, so where'd your barrier?  Do you drive a yellow cab?  Does he drive a yellow cab or is it like a mid-marine cab?  This guy drives, it's not even a livery.  It's pretty much his own car, it looks like.  Right, Big A? 
[02:53:00]  Actually, it's a company-owned car.  He drives Ernest Borgnine's cab from Escape from New York.  He drives in the Bronx, Otto.  Oh, Jesus.  And he drives the bad hours.  Well, fuck.  Which is pretty much 24 hours.  Andrew, what happened?  You were supposed to get off because you wanted to go see Otto's show.  And then when did you realize you couldn't?  What happened?  Oh, um, I was really not happy. 
[02:53:30]  You know, I was really not happy.  But how did you find out?  Like, what happened?  Like, you called or?  Lesbian cunt.  Hello, lesbian cunt.  What are my hours today?  There's a puppet in New Brunswick.  Actually, I got a call going downtown at like 6.30.  And I knew there was no chance of getting back home. 
[02:54:00]  So there's no chance.  No chance.  No chance.  Godfather.  No chance.  No chance.  The movie.  Yeah.  You won't get that picture.  All right, Big A.  I don't know if we got much with you today.  Well, I don't know what to do.  Yeah.  You're not like a man.  Stutter.  I can't get off to Seattle.  So, where was you?  You knew you got a call that you had to take. 
[02:54:30]  Why didn't you just say you didn't want to take it?  I don't know.  Because I was just hurt a bunch of shit today.  So I just.  Tell her you're going to quit and go with your original choice of being an auctioneer.  Just tell her that's it.  Yeah.  Everything's sold for a nickel.  Yeah.  You're first calling.  Oh.  Yeah.  A big A. 
[02:55:00]  Okay.  All right, big A.  I guess that's all we get today, huh?  Right.  All right.  We'll see you soon.  We'll see you soon.  We're glad you're on the mend, Andrew.  Yeah.  I look forward to hearing you on Ron and Fez with a lot of energy and a lot more to add to  their program.  And thank you for coming to my signing Thursday.  It was good seeing you.  Thanks a lot, Jimmy.  It was a pleasure being here.  You had a great time.  All right, big A.  We'll see you soon.  Pat from Monaki and Steven from Bayshore.  Oh, yeah.  What a creep Steven from Bayshore is. 
[02:55:30]  He's got his fucking sideburns.  He's like a really weird Elvis impersonator.  Yeah.  He's a psychopath.  He sings Elvis.  Does he really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He sings it well.  To a T.  I didn't know that.  He sang that song we were playing for a while.  Where is it?  I did know that.  He did a great version of that.  He sang some great real Elvis songs.  Yeah.  I heard some of his work.  It's very good.  Well, he did the song parody.  What was that?  What was the song parody again?  My Aids.  My Aids.  This is for you, Jimmy.  I know.  I didn't recognize that that was him.  Keith, hold on one second.  Let's hear this.  Yes. 
[02:56:00]  This is Steve from Bayshore.  Steve rules.  Listen to this, Adam.  All the words to a chapter here.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  And now, the hiv is near.  And so I face the viral hurtin'.  My friend, I'm not a queen.  You love that.  I love those girls with thick meat curtains. 
[02:56:30]  I've lived life as a fool.  I've traveled down that Hershey Highway.  I'm sure it's things like this that gave me my age.  Old pets, I've banged a few, but then again, most of them female. 
[02:57:00]  I've paid for sex with youths and one or two large organ she-mails.  My glands feel scraped and coarse.  My little lungs are clogged with mucus.  Oh, duh.  Like Robert Reed, I think it's my age. 
[02:57:30]  I've had some times more than a few when I bit off road number two.  But do it all when you're in spouts.  Oh, yes, it's true.  I suck it up.  Yeah, and eat a ride.  These saws ain't small, they're on my balls, you can blame it on my aids. 
[02:58:00]  I've loved in bareback style, I've had my ass filled with four fingers.  And now, it's no surprise, that not one team cell ever lingers, to think, I slept with that toothless crack hole, way up in Harlem at first. 
[02:58:30]  Just HIV, and now it's my eyes.  Or how can a man, born with no chin, eat broth each meal, he'll grow too thin. 
[02:59:00]  I start to sweat, my skin might scorch, it started off under that porch.  It don't look good, poor little Jim, how I hate my aids.  I should have not French kissed that Jim, how I've got my aids. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, the great...  That is pretty good, isn't it?  The great Steve from Basel.  That's a good Elvis right there.  He does sound like him.  That's great, man.  Pat from Minaki reminds us that Steve also did the song Viva Auschwitz that we have played on our show.  We haven't played it wide.  Viva Das Auschwitz.  Why haven't we played it?  Oh, it's just really tasteless. 
[03:00:00]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  You rock.  Instead of Viva Las Vegas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you have it?  Why haven't we played it?  What was the official...  Microphony rock.  We decided we'd like our jobs.  Do we have it?  I think it was taken from me.  I really don't know where it is.  Wow, no way.  Who took it from you?  I don't know, but it was...  I think as a show, we were a little scared because he kind of handed it in when we were going  through some things.  I think we should probably play it long enough until we go, okay, now I see why we didn't  play it.  Well, can we play it and just acknowledge how awful it is? 
[03:00:30]  Let me see if I can find a copy.  See if we can find it.  Was there an official reason why we didn't play that?  I know we were all real nervous.  A large Jewish population in New York.  Maybe you want to screen it first.  Maybe.  Yeah, I want to hear it.  All right, well...  I've never heard a song about Auschwitz.  That'd be good therapy, too.  Well, Dan S. from Long Island, he's like...  Let's see the hands.  Dan S. is like, if you guys are going to play some songs, you might as well play My Dick's  All Shitty.  Have you heard this one yet, Otto? 
[03:01:00]  No.  Well, that's a favorite.  Listen to this.  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your ass.  Oh, dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your ass.  To this great song.  Yeah.  God.  My dick's all shitty. 
[03:01:30]  This music is so bad.  You say you won't blow me  Don't like it in your face  Say you won't retake the cock  In your dirty face  Now I'm all filthy  There's duty on my dick  It looks just like a black man's  But not quite as thick 
[03:02:00]  Now your ghoulie  Now your ghoulie needs a diaper  Your ghoulie?  Oh, because you won't hit the cock  I've got a dirty hamper  And my dick's all shitty  Say my dick's all shitty  From your ass  My dick's all shitty  Goes back into it  My dick's all shitty  From your ass  My dick's all shitty  This song rules  Yeah  My dick's all shitty 
[03:02:30]  From your ass  I would have liked to have been in a room  With like, this is the finished product  Here it is, guys  This is the one we're sending  Here it is  Smell the glove  We can't get enough of it out there, Kenny  I think it's the grovelly voice that makes it  My dick's all shitty  My dick's all shitty  And a horrible MIDI version  You can picture him singing it  Like he's holding his headphones  And his eyes are closed  My dick's all shitty  Oh, yeah  He's belting this out  Yeah  Well, we're getting 
[03:03:00]  Like Dirk Diggler in the studio  I was just thinking  That Dirk Diggler scene  Yeah  Horrible off-key  We're getting a question  We get all the time  Reading from Whackbag  Is this leading to the return  Of Most Offensive Song?  I would love to do  Most Offensive Song  Let's do it  The problem is  It just always goes  To one group of people  No, I think  That was the problem  We could then sort it out  To where it's very diverse  In its subject matter  Right  People just love to, you know  Just take it to one place 
[03:03:30]  I say we should do that again  Hey, we got Steve  Maybe it's because they want to put words like  Figure in there  And bigger  Maybe about bugs  Chigger  They just want to rhyme with that  And that's why they  Always go in one direction  But they ruin it  Steven from Bayshore  What's up?  Good morning, gentlemen  How are you?  Hi, Steven  We're rude  Thanks  I can send Iraq a link  To the Viva Das Auschwitz  Toe Tapper  If you want 
[03:04:00]  Toe Tapper  It's a very popular song  It's never been played on our show  But the hardcore fans  All know about it  Yeah  What was the reason  We gave you, Steven?  Patrice was on  And you guys were talking about  Who the most evil dictator was  And somebody came up  With the phrase that  Hitler was the eldest of evil  And Ant just sang  Viva Auschwitz  Then the song just wrote itself from there  All right  And then Steve picked up  And took the ball  Well, can we get a copy of that? 
[03:04:30]  We're going to get a copy  Of course  Do we remember why we never played it, though?  Did you send it in  When we were in all that trouble?  No, no  This was like in February last year  I think we were still, yeah  You're telling me  Ant said to you  Everything is going really well  We want to play this song  And get fired  So  Yeah, maybe that was it  It is brutal  It is good, though  It makes sense  Yeah, it's very offensive  I can give the  If you put me on hold  I can give the  Probably just  State the link to somebody  And they can go try to find it 
[03:05:00]  All right  Okay  All right, we'll put you on  Police hold, sir  I mean, if we're talking about  The most offensive song  You know, ever  Maybe we can play  A little piece of that  The most offensive song  You've ever heard  Remember that guy?  He was part of the  Most offensive song contest  Oh, yeah, yeah  They're like a Barry Manilow  But the thought  That we played  Some of those songs  On regular FM radio  Just chills me  Do you have the one by Q?  It's one of the greatest contests ever  Baby Raper 
[03:05:30]  Camp Concentration  You got any of these songs?  Welcome to Camp Concentration  That was an upper  Do you have the one  Touching little girls  Or whatever?  Horny for little girls, yeah  I'm horny for little girls  I heard that once  I still remember where I was  I was on 10th Avenue  I believe, north  By Lincoln Town  When I heard that  We couldn't  We couldn't play that song  Further than  I'm horny for little girls  Cause little girls have  And then it just  And we've got  And we played the whole song  On regular radio 
[03:06:00]  On regular radio  One day  We gotta get a whole list of stuff  We can't play on regular radio anymore  Put it on the website  All mine furor  People will be amazed  Of all the stuff  That would not fly today  Just boned my daughter  What was that to?

[03:06:30]  Is just pure evil  Alright, do we have it?  Yeah  Look, it's part of something  We did do on the radio  Yeah  You actually played this whole song  On terrestrial radio?  Yes  Which is bizarre  I think by the time I heard it  Was there a time then  Where you wanted to play it after  And they said  No more  You can't play that again  Okay, that's probably  What I heard part of  I don't think I ever heard  The whole song  Yeah, because somebody  I think our bosses  At some point said  Did you ever play a song  Because months later  Did you ever play a song  Titled this?  It's like, yeah  But we were doing  The most offensive song contest 
[03:07:00]  It's in the context of  We asked listeners  To write songs  That are so heinous  And offensive  And the worst one will win  You know what?  And everyone remembers  This like it was yesterday  Now it's coming in  Play Imagine  That was the one  Oh, shit  That one would get us  Fucking  Oh, that was a bad one  Out here today  Where are these songs  Hiding out  For people that want  To go find them  That's secret  I don't know  Don't tell them on the air  They're out there somewhere  We don't know  Where these went

[03:10:00]  We knew what the winner was  And I think it was Imagine  Yeah, it was freaking Guido  He sang it like a Guido  It was  Oh, there's also  Wait a minute  What?  Candyman  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  Who could take  Alright  Remember that one?  It was the KKK song  They called it  Yeah  The KKK can  The KKK can  If I'm not mistaken  Maybe someone could help me out  But Howard was so shocked  That he played us playing it

[03:12:30]  Every time  Right  But the context of this was  That we asked people  We solicited offensive songs  For a contest  Original  During a time that was  You know  On regular radio  Original  You could get away with this stuff  I say that twice  Because a few people  Snuck some oldies  But goodies in there  Oh well of course  I'm like  We wanted all original songs  Alright let's hear  Oh it was Fuel  That's right  Let's see if we can get  A piece of this on the radio right now  One, two, three

[03:17:30]  yeah let's uh let's say hi to frank in manhattan faithful listener he's been with us a long time  what's up frank guys you gotta play the live version of baby raper the thousands of guys  screaming that refrain was the funniest thing on the show ever that was a bad one yeah i remember 
[03:18:00]  everyone was singing along i think that was uh the song that was probably gonna win it all  yeah because that was that was really really bad because it was really catchy yeah he had a nice  melody and it was real catchy do we have that oh yes you are yes you are sorry i was setting up line  of the day i didn't hear what you were asking for baby raper live and when the whole audience is 
[03:18:30]  singing along with it dude all right yeah because that was uh that was the big get that day oh oh  this contest was taken so seriously naacp protests michael vick's suspension why uh uh one guess oh  right sorry why you know what the fuck he's been doing he's been strangling would they come to  would they come to the defense of any white guy my that was doing the same thing wait can i can i 
[03:19:00]  jump in real fast uh sure uh i uh i think michael vick should be able to play football yeah yeah are  they are they protesting it only because it would be very it would be very hypocritical of us to say  that he shouldn't be able to play football why that's a crime yeah but it has nothing to do with  football if he's not in jail uh it's different than football has the nfl has high standards dude  it's different than words what we do are words he was he was killing dogs and torturing them he was 
[03:19:30]  drowning them in a pool yeah yeah horrific obviously but let the guy play football make for an  interesting season so but the n uh double acp protesting uh michael vick's suspension i want  to know are they protesting because they're saying that he hasn't been found guilty of anything  and the nfl is automatically assuming he's guilty i don't know i mean why then we don't have any  details why doesn't the n double acp judge people by the content of their character and not the color  of their skin can they do that for one fucking time just take it and judge the person by what they've 
[03:20:00]  done and what they're doing instead of just the fact that they're black yeah god what a racist  organization jesus fucking christ come on already stop protecting people just because they're black  skinned well according to the n double acp blacks cannot commit crimes they can do nothing wrong  apparently and bury the n-word that's the problem that's breaking yeah we'll get more on that uh we  got baby raper oh doing all right let's acknowledge this was uh something we did a long time ago 
[03:20:30]  most offensive songs on regular radio yeah and then we had a huge live concert in front of at least a  thousand of our listeners and all the guys that were kind of in the finals all got to play their song  in front of everybody and uh this is uh pretty much a thousand people singing along to this little  diddy go ahead there we'll see how much we can play that  the other inmates think i'm kind of sick 
[03:21:00]  because of where i like to dip my stick  and how i always talk about the day  i met that little hottie john benet whose parents did kill her by the way i wish that they 
[03:21:30]  could somehow understand this is hard i'm just an average ordinary man  but somehow they just can't seem to get  while maggie simpson always makes me wet  here it comes 
[03:22:00]  you know  all right the whole freaking crowds of course they were they're animals that they knew that they knew the  song that well and this was before the internet really took off yeah that was just from all the  times we play it on our show it's a hit we we uh yeah we would play that over and over again it 
[03:22:30]  was part of the tasteless most tasteless song contest right and uh boy was that a contender  yeah yeah yeah because that was just awful and uh the people seem to enjoy the tune  wow all right let's go to jeremy in cleveland jeremy what's up  boys i wanted to know maybe if you could play the fba live version meow punch me out  a full-blown age live i think that was kind of the one that started it all yeah that was like the 
[03:23:00]  offensive one but we got the uh steve from uh bayshore song yeah then by the way they're saying  the crash suspect that caused the chopper crash may face murder charges yeah unless he murdered  somebody on the ground uh no they're trying to bring they're saying that he caused yeah yeah  two fucking news organizations to be so careless yeah absolutely in their fucking in their in their  quest for the best shot yeah jim there is a uh there is a law that uh states that if you during 
[03:23:30]  the commission of a felony cause uh people to die uh you can be charged absolutely that does not count  people who are fucking being so careless desperate to get the better shot they crash helicopters  there's a that's a completely uh avoidable situation i think they think of it as you know  if you weren't there uh doing what you did the copters wouldn't have been there and and you know 
[03:24:00]  they wouldn't have been dead absolutely but how about this if the news of me can go back one step  if the news organizations put the safety of their employees before the best shot that they could throw  their fucking watermark uh stamp on that wouldn't have happened how about this guy walks into a bank  to rob it they own it right guy walks into the bank he's gonna rob it some fat load of shit who has  not taken care of themselves in years is just like like waiting uh at the counter there and just drops 
[03:24:30]  dead of a heart attack and the guy will be charged with killing with some type of manslaughter for  robbing that bank right and the meanwhile it's because the person is fucking fat and out of shape  and and would have had a heart attack like a week later i'll tell you why because that guy was uh  was in the bank and the man caught robbing it directly causes heart attack they chose to follow that  guy uh they chose their job that's what they do they're not their job to be so callous they put that they 
[03:25:00]  should be in trouble for putting for being so careless they put the public at risk what if they would have  fallen on top of a school a school or something like that dare to dream yeah that guy would have  had a lot more murder charges i lately fault the news yeah i think it's crazy too that you bring a  more murder charge he's not a murder charges on that that's ridiculous that's kind of doing the  bank analogy like also the bank robber leaves and now you're you're just a dope running down the  street chasing the guy and you drop dead of a heart attack what happens there uh there yeah still  guy could be charged stupid law the death and the commission of a felony but that's the 
[03:25:30]  cops on the way to a bank robbery driving they get into an accident uh get charged with murder  cops are different they're going again their job is to be there well their job is to cover the the  car chase with the helicopters what do you think they got the helicopters for but not that doesn't  that still doesn't treat does not fall under the same uh police going to the scene of a crime to  prevent it does not fall under the same category as news copters uh a vultury uh chase uh to get better 
[03:26:00]  footage for their fucking station to get the ratings up somewhere advertising i agree with  jimmy you know what i think we're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one he's not a murderer  the guy's not a murderer at all that's like saying let's say you were doing a felony uh let's say you  had robbed the house and you were running away sure and a news cop was chasing all of a sudden  crashed into a building because they were trying to get a better shot of you and you ducked behind  a building are you saying that you should be charged with murder because i'm saying i absolutely  should be charged with murder no throw lock me up and throw away the key i say no no no okay i won't 
[03:26:30]  all right uh wouldn't want to be getting ass sex all day like that are we gonna try once a week  we're gonna try this steven s uh steven from basher yeah what was his song viva oh das auschwitz yeah  yeah yeah he does a good elvis i say the words are plurable but get ready on that stop button there  rock let's go snappy dress is gonna set my right gonna set my rack on fire

[03:31:00]  dr r-l white discussing issues surrounding michael sick  let's listen in  legal process to take this course  many of you remember it has not been long that the duke lacrosse team  was seriously damaged by allegations  they were tried by public opinion only to be cleared  after all of the public scorn  yep  mr vick 
[03:31:30]  is guilty  he should pay for his crime  but  to treat him  as he's being treated now  is also  a crime  he has not lost his rights  as a citizen in this country  to be considered  innocent  until proven  guilty  all right  there is a good point about the duke lacrosse team  uh that did wreck them 
[03:32:00]  and they hadn't done anything wrong  right  well it's funny i didn't hear the n-double-a-c-p piping up back then though  then why did um  why did i mislose his job  he wasn't suspended  they they fired him  right  like why did that happen  it wasn't even a crime  please  please  be restrained in your premature judgment  until the legal process  has been 
[03:32:30]  and uh... the state representatives who will be here shortly  uh... but this is essentially what we've called to say  and we will have  as the questions now  once again this is atlanta's n-double-a-c president doctor rl white making  some uh... comments there regarding the michael vick case  just asking everyone to remember that he has not  been to a court of law on this  he has pled not guilty  and trying to get everyone to  reserve their judgment  on the case and on michael vick until 
[03:33:00]  it goes through the court process  they were saying it was the n-double-a-c-p  who was saying the duke players were guilty the whole time  they were the ones pumping  uh... up everybody saying that they were guilty  let's not rush to judgment like we did  well there you go  well there you go  yeah it's funny that i guess they weren't big on the legal process when it was the duke guys  enough divisiveness  ugh it's just  ugh  disgusted with it all 
[03:33:30]  i'm from every organization  believe me  every single one of them  every stupid group  enough with your groups  would have been funny if he was like  shit somebody fucked up this statement  we fucked up what statement uh reading it  forget it  oh like barry wang  kind of called back  barry wang  yeah  i need another pep talk  fuck shit fuck  let's go to eddie and uh  the secret from auto  yeah  try not to speak  let's go to eddie in brooklyn  eddie 
[03:34:00]  hey jimmy  how come every time there's a police chase  on the show they stop the show and watch it  you know why  because the media gets it so you guys can be entertained  yes  yeah  i'm not saying we're not entertained by it  we're not saying that they shouldn't get the story  what i'm talking about  is to go get the story to be so  look dude  there's a fucking open sky  two helicopters can't fit and get the same shot  no it's the same thing with the vic morrow death  you know  well what would happen if these two helicopters fell on the borders  and people couldn't buy jimmy norton's new book happy endings

[03:35:00]  that was  that was  lying about  the lacrosse team  wouldn't they backing her  when that shit  yeah they were pretty much saying that the lacrosse team was guilty  and now they're using that  as the reason  why  it's just  it's ludicrous  please  it's all based on race  and ethnic backgrounds  and all this crap  everyone's got their little groups now  everyone's empowered  enough  all right
