<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with introductions, establishing the hosts' reputation for controversial content. Jim Norton recounted a hilariously uncomfortable sleep study experience, detailing malfunctioning equipment and his interactions with the technician.  He then discussed his "hipster weekend," including a Pearl Jam concert with initially bad seats that were unexpectedly upgraded.  He detailed humorous interactions with a friend who preferred a surprise setlist, mentioning specific songs played and omitted. The conversation shifted to a Banksy artwork that appeared in Norton's neighborhood, describing the artwork, reactions from neighbors (including an irritating old woman), its protection with Plexiglas, and subsequent vandalism attempts.  A significant segment focused on a video of a Jets fan punching a Patriots fan, with the hosts analyzing the video, the woman's aggressive behavior preceding the punch, and the media's biased reporting. They debated the man's actions. The show then covered Norton's thoughts on a new NFL rule regarding pushing during field goals, the Jets' win, their opinions on Guy Fieri, and a viral Red Sox song, concluding with their World Series team preferences.

The show then transitioned to a reminiscence segment, reviewing old photos and videos from their SiriusXM days.  They discussed a photo of a woman in toilet paper during a Rodney Dangerfield appearance, a pre-9/11 visit to the World Trade Center, on-air antics involving nudity and sex toys, and a Louis C.K. interview podcast.  They also delved into a NAMBLA documentary, discussing graphic accounts and interviews, particularly focusing on Leland Stevenson. A caller, a former "To Catch a Predator" decoy, shared her experiences.  The hosts briefly touched upon Eminem's lyrics, Cory Booker officiating gay weddings, and the Terry Schiavo case, alongside a discussion of YouTube clips of Mike Francesa, including one where he was unaware he was on air.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Mike Francesa, featuring clips showcasing his on-air mishaps, particularly involving ice cream and Diet Coke.  The hosts highlighted Francesa's reactions to prank calls, his attempts to conceal his ice cream consumption, and his Diet Coke spills, emphasizing his denial and defensiveness.  They discussed listener prank calls targeting Francesa, including a viral parody video and a prank call involving a dog named after him. A caller impersonated a sports doctor, offering Francesa Diet Coke as a cure for an injury, and another prank call involved feeding a dog a gallon of Diet Coke.  The conversation shifted to a Conan O'Brien segment featuring a Mike Myers montage, a violent incident involving a white couple and black youths in Brooklyn, a large bowling alley fight, and general commentary on societal issues. They also discussed the "Kane Show," listener interactions, workplace dynamics, including the appropriateness of giving coworkers used clothing, and a Seinfeld bit about a chef not washing his hands. The segment concluded with a discussion on "phone topics," listener calls, and bribes offered to teachers for grade changes, including one offering a clitoris piercing.

A segment focused on criticizing seemingly fake radio bits, particularly "loser line" calls and "War of the Roses"-style segments.  The hosts and John dissected pre-recorded calls, highlighting inconsistencies and unbelievable scenarios. A caller from D.C. revealed he was a voice actor for such bits on various shows, including the "War of the Roses" segment on The Kane Show (which was played on air).  The hosts heavily criticized the writing and production quality.  Jenna Jameson then joined the show, discussing her new erotic novel, "Sugar," custody issues with Tito Ortiz, financial rumors, and her experiences in the adult film industry.  She discussed the industry's changes, the challenges of making money in the digital age, and the difficulties of maintaining a public persona while dealing with personal struggles.

Jenna Jameson's appearance continued into another segment, primarily focusing on her custody battle, which limited her visits with her children to two days a week at $400/hour. She discussed being barred from her home, her dating struggles since leaving the adult film industry, and her book, "Sugar," along with an upcoming book signing. The conversation covered her physical appearance, weight loss, sobriety (seven years clean), and humorous banter about sex and body image.  She shared a frightening experience with a fan and stated she had no competitive feelings towards newer performers and no desire to return to the adult film industry. The interview concluded with promoting her book and book signing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is he happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling. What are we going to hear in here today?  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah! Good morning, everyone.  Oh, there it is. There's that tune.  It's Monday.  Number one hit tune.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a good one.  Yeah.  Oh, it is Monday.  Oh, damn.  Oh, I thought it was Thursday.  That would be nice, right?  No one ever mistakes a Monday for a Thursday. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, ho.  Wow.  Wow.  Good morning, Jim Norton.  You all right?  Yeah.  What happened?  I had my sleep study tonight, Monday night.  Oh, right.  So I was going to stay up all night.  Ah.  So I let myself sleep for an hour.  I'm just like, I'm just tired.  Holy shit.  How do you do that?  I actually wish I didn't sleep because I feel more rested than I should have.  But one hour.  I would not be able to be here if I had an hour of sleep.  Yeah.  No fucking way. 
[00:02:00]  I was going to do it all night and then just I'll try to sleep tonight at the study, which  I won't be able to.  How many sleep studies do you need, though?  My third one.  It's fucking, uh, it's an abomination.  Unbelievable.  The last one, I want to fucking run it with a suicide vest on.  They fucked up.  That last one fucking.  How do they fuck up?  Because, um.  He was awake the whole time.  Exactly.  And they just made me study for a test.  I was like, it's an algebra.  They, uh, they had the wrong mask.  They're giving me the wrong.  I woke up gasping.  I was like in the middle of the test. 
[00:02:30]  Jesus.  I woke up like.  Like, I knew that I had the wrong machine.  Right.  I said to her, this is.  It's the Kevorkian machine.  Yeah.  I was like, why are we in the garage?  I said, why am I hooked up to the exhaust pipe?  She said, people have requested it.  So I said, you gotta hook me up to the ASV.  That's what I'm supposed to be tested for.  She goes, no, you don't need that.  Hook the ASS up to the ASV.  I know.  Hopefully it'll help with my HIV and my HPV.  B double O.  An ASV. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, man.  This sounds exhausting.  Let me tell you something.  Sleep studies are complete bullshit.  Yeah.  They really are.  Because you have to go to some weird place.  Right.  It's not your bed.  It's not your pillow.  Then they wire you up.  You can't sleep on your belly like you usually do.  Because you have to make sure all the equipment is on you properly.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't roll all over it.  And then you get your results.  And they're like, yeah, see, you're a shitty sleeper.  No, I can't sleep this way.  I'm in a laboratory. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, they should come to your home where you're comfortable and do it with your bed,  your pillow, your comforter, your lighting.  With some Star Trek shit that ain't connected to you.  Exactly.  Just like that.  Stuff that hovers over you.  I understand how it works, but it's so stupid.  With a fucking camera.  Yeah, but there's no way you're going to fucking sleep properly in that condition, ever.  If I fall asleep, all they need to do is get the readings.  I need to sleep.  If I'm knocked out somehow and they get the readings on what machine levels it takes to 
[00:04:00]  make my breathing correct, then I can just deal with it at home.  Even if it takes me six months to get used to it, I have the settings.  It's all about getting the settings right.  I'll get used to it my own time.  Plus, there's a camera.  They're looking at you sleeping and you're aware of that.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  They're watching you.  You're not going to get as accurate results.  I'm sorry.  I have to get an Ambien today if I can for tonight.  I've only taken one in my life and that was last year for the study. 
[00:04:30]  Wait, so you're going to take an Ambien for your sleep study?  At the place, yeah.  But doesn't that make you sleep a little better so that'll mess up the results too?  No, no, no, no.  I don't think so.  I took one last year and they told me it was okay.  No, because you're sleeping is still the same.  It makes you doze off faster or it helps you.  But you're breathing or not breathing is still the same.  If that was the case, I'd be taking Ambien all the time.  They actually made me sleep good.  Is this regular coffee?  Uh-oh.  I can only have decaf today.  No caffeine.  I don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Ask a...  Oh, right.  No, that's regular.  I wasn't told that you need a decaf.  Oh, okay.  Uh-oh.  I'll send somebody, though.  That's a hell of a start to a radio show right there.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  How was everyone's weekend?  Good.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Sure.  I was just telling Anthony I had a hipster weekend.  Yeah.  I had a hipster weekend.  I got to see Pearl Jam in Brooklyn.  I saw those tweets.  Yeah.  Oh, that was the other one.  They were very concerned about my seat at Pearl Jam. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, God.  They were very concerned about my seat at Pearl Jam.  Were they very concerned?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You would think you would get better seats.  Oh, my God.  I told Anne I'm pretty much going to shut down everything, and I'm just going to do basic  shit, because the whole social world is just a ridiculous place.  It's just ridiculous. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  There's a whole world of social media out there where there's just no repercussions  to you just mouthing off to someone.  Could you imagine just walking up to somebody and saying the stuff that is said on Twitter?  It's astounding.  But now there's this release to just be an asshole.  You realize that the world is filled with a lot of miserable people, a lot of people that  aren't doing much with their lives, and they're ridiculously picky because they have nothing 
[00:06:30]  going on with themselves.  Oh, my goodness.  The first comment on this photo is, couldn't you get better tickets?  Parentheses, Twitter voice.  Oh, okay.  Even new.  Yeah, I get that, obviously.  But then you got the same.  Then you got other people that actually write that and mean that.  First of all, where we started the Pearl Jam show, they were great seats.  I kind of liked where we sit. 
[00:07:00]  It was kind of cool to see the whole.  The thing about taking photos is it never looks exactly as close as you really are.  Right.  You know?  Like, we didn't look that far away.  No, it didn't look that far away.  And then, you know, we got some connections at the Barclays.  And, you know, the guy comes over and, first of all, gives us the Pearl Jam set list, which  was cool.  Although Travis didn't want to play along.  So, I ended up going to Pearl Jam with Travis and Troy.  And he didn't want to play along.  I was excited to look at the set list. 
[00:07:30]  He wanted to be surprised.  I understand that.  Oh.  Yes.  Oh, he goes, hey, I got the set list.  I'm like, don't even think about showing that to me.  Spoilers on a set list?  Yeah.  And then, but then I hinted every once in a while.  I kind of whispered to Travis, like, I think you're going to like this next one.  I could help myself.  He's like, you want a beer?  I know what's coming next.  So, I'm going to go get a beer.  I saw a two-song block where I'm like, I could go get myself a beer.  What did they open with?  What was the opening song?  Pendulum.  Pendulum.  Yes.  Off the new album, Lightning Bolt.  You like it?  Yeah, I do. 
[00:08:00]  It was a good opening song.  I got to hear it a few more times.  Then they opened again with release.  They're doing this, like, double opener thing this tour.  They're playing, like, two opening songs.  Well, the second and the third song.  You could have gone home.  That's what I told Travis.  I'm like, I'm happy.  I could go home now.  It was released, which I love.  And they've abbreviated it to small town at this point.  But it's elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  Those two songs I love.  They're probably on my top ten.  Wow.  So, I look at Travis.  I'm like, we're 15 minutes in and I've already heard two songs, you know, that I really want to hear tonight. 
[00:08:30]  When did they play Even Flow?  That's a big hit.  They didn't do the Even Flow.  Oh, what about Jeremy?  They didn't do that.  Oh, oh.  Twelve shows for me now.  That's only the second time they haven't played Even Flow.  Oh, sure.  That's fine with me because I got, like, you end up getting, like, three songs in the span that it takes them to play Even Flow.  Who cares?  It's Even Flow.  Well, they didn't do Even Flow.  They didn't do Jeremy.  Jeremy, no Jeremy.  That's ballsy, I think.  They don't play Jeremy a lot.  They don't play Jeremy a lot anymore. 
[00:09:00]  Not a lot, no.  Really?  I've only seen it once.  They didn't play Yellow Lead better.  That's another one I would have liked to hear.  They played that the next night.  They didn't play Black is a song I really, really like.  No, but I saw the set list.  And then some of that other shit, like I've Got a Feeling would have been cool.  It was a great show.  It was a great show, and you missed a great one.  I really don't care.  That general admission area down there is just fantastic.  So then for the second half of the show, the guy who got us the seats originally, he actually 
[00:09:30]  apologized for where we're sitting, and I'm like, are you kidding me?  This is awesome.  I didn't have a fucking ticket.  Thank you so much.  How far back were you?  I was very appreciative.  To the back of the arena, I'm halfway down, something like that.  More to the left, I guess.  Almost to the back of the arena, on the left side.  And then the guy goes, look, if I could do something, I'll come back and get you guys.  I'm like, yeah, man, whatever.  But this is great.  I'm very happy and appreciative.  And halfway through the show, he's like, hey, come with me.  I don't have wristbands, so take...  Where are we going?  He goes, take leaks now, because you're not going to be able to get out. 
[00:10:00]  And then he brings us right pretty much 20, 25 feet from the stage for the second half  of the show.  Righteous.  And then we went there.  Yeah.  That was great.  And I almost made it to the end.  Almost.  I missed the last two songs, but I knew which two songs I was going to miss.  You had the set list.  God, no.  What would I do that for?  I knew Jay-Z wasn't coming out this time.  I knew there weren't any special guests.  I missed Sonic Reducer and Indifference. 
[00:10:30]  I would have liked to...  It's a Dead Boys cover, Sonic Reducer.  And I would have liked to have seen Indifference.  That would have been kind of cool live.  How's that sound?  I never heard it.  What, Sonic Reducer?  No, no, Indifference.  Indifference is very slow.  Closer off Versus.  Yeah, it's a great song.  Versus is a big album.  Versus is a huge album.  Sure, that was their second album.  Of course.  It's 20 years old.  But I left after Alive.  I'm like, this is perfect.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here and get back on the subway.  Back to my safe little neighborhood.  Huh?  At least they played Alive.  That's a big...  How's that one go? 
[00:11:00]  Brrrr!  Oh, okay, yeah.  Yeah, I kind of like this song.  Your impression almost ruins it, by the way.  I was sitting there thinking of you.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  This one kind of sounds like how Anthony does the impression.  The first time he started talking after Mind Your Manners, all I'm thinking is Jay Moore.  Jay Moore's talking Eddie Vedder impression.  It's one of my favorite things.  He didn't talk much.  Not a lot, no.  No, huh?  He didn't talk much and he kept it very safe.  He kept it very safe when he was talking. 
[00:11:30]  Do you think he drinks all that wine?  Absolutely.  Every show?  Yeah, he gets...  I think there's water in those fucking bottles.  No, because then he passes it out to the crowd.  No, you got to know which one to pass out to the crowd.  Oh, it's like a magic act.  I think he's doing a little magic act out there because he drinks bottles of red wine.  And I'm thinking there's got to be at least one of those bottles that's just filled with water so he can hydrate.  And then it's like, okay, now I got the red wine again, so I'm going to kind of pour a little bit and show the people I'm drinking wine. 
[00:12:00]  Possible.  That's his wine.  You think he gets that hammered every night?  He makes his own wine.  Yeah, he's got his own...  Fuck this guy.  Why does he make his own wine?  Anthony.  Why not?  Like Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gerard Germain.  That's the even flow.  Yeah.  I'm wearing a pearl necklace.  I'm wearing it across my teeth.  And my mustache.  I have a pearl mustache.  Look, I got a cool shot of Eddie Vedder swinging into the crowd. 
[00:12:30]  He's swinging on the lights.  Yeah, we were very close.  We were extremely close.  You know who was front and center in the pit on Saturday night?  Huh.  Super fan Dennis Rodman.  Dennis Rodman, really?  Dennis Rodman loves Pearl Jam.  Wow.  Yeah.  He goes right into that general admission area.  That's a little strange.  He loves Pearl Jam.  He throws elbows around to give himself some room.  That Barclays Center, though, by the way, is fucking fantastic.  It's pretty cool.  Nice.  Yeah.  All new.  Nice and new.  And you pop out of the subway, because, you know, it's Brooklyn. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  You know, Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn.  You know.  Oh, you don't want to walk around too much.  So I pop out of the subway, getting ready to be, you know, on high alert.  Uh-huh.  And all of a sudden, the Barclays is right there.  Yeah.  Right in front of you.  They figured that out.  Absolutely.  White bitch.  You just have an arrow and say, white people here.  Yes.  Right in front of you.  It's very cool.  You walk up the stairs, and you're literally at the front of Barclays.  You're literally safe, is what you want to say. 
[00:13:30]  Safe.  How far from Manhattan is that train ride?  It was about 20 minutes.  If you take the express train, you're like 20 minutes away.  Yeah.  It was easy.  I mean, I got on a subway very close to my joint, and it let me out right there.  What train goes there?  It's like an embassy.  That's an embassy.  They set up an embassy over there.  It's sovereign soil of white people.  It really is, because as soon as you walk up out of the subway, you know you're completely  safe.  Right, right.  I thought you had to walk a couple blocks like you have to do in Newark.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  They got a nice joint over there. 
[00:14:00]  But from the subway, or the train, actually, to the arena is fucking sketchy and scary  as shit, where they corral you to the venue with a shitload of Newark police on hand.  There are cops around the subway, though, right?  For the events and stuff in Newark?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  In Newark?  Yeah.  But it's still very sketchy.  Not the Barclays Center.  It's not the Barclays, where you pop out, and you're in a sovereign nation like this.  Yeah.  You're on sovereign white person's soil.  It's a great venue.  I want to go see some of them. 
[00:14:30]  What do you think of the sound?  The sound is okay.  They don't have the best sound there.  Yeah.  I saw McCartney there, too.  And there's almost like a hollowness to the arena.  Right.  It's tough to explain.  But the sound is okay.  I'd probably rather see a show at MSG than Barclays.  But Barclays is getting all the shows right now.  And they kind of messed up The Architect a little bit.  But the guy was explaining, like, there's no Section 121 because they, I don't know, they didn't lay it out properly. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  He was telling us some interesting stuff about what's going to happen when hockey comes to the arena.  And then, you know, they got the Islanders, obviously.  And one of the things, if you're going to hockey games, it's kind of cool to sit, you know, behind the goal.  Yeah.  It's just a cool place to sit.  At the Barclays, you can't do that for one side of the ice.  Because they didn't really set it up for hockey.  But you got to think if you're going to, you know, get a whole new arena together, wouldn't you set it up for a hockey or some kind of ice shit? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Thinking you could get something in there.  So they got to figure it out.  So behind one of the goals, there's really no seats.  I'm sure they'll make some modular thing they could drag out.  This is what it's going to look like.  Yeah.  See how there's no seats all the way to the left?  You can't have no seats.  But why would they design it like that?  That's terrible.  Because they didn't design it for hockey.  They didn't, I mean.  But if you're going to put a big spot in.  Yeah.  They got to put seats there.  Disney on ice, whatever the fuck.  You need people banging on the glass. 
[00:16:00]  No, so it's just weird.  Yeah, but Disney on ice doesn't play on a regulation hockey rink.  I know, I know.  But you got to think.  You just got to assume that eventually, you know, you might need some hockey in there.  That'll be weird.  Right.  Yeah.  So why are they doing that?  Well, now they have to do it because the Islanders are moving to the Barclays.  Are they going to fix it?  I guess they were just, I think they were trying to cut corners, to be honest with you.  How much?  And they probably just assumed they were.  Maybe do a side of an arena, you know?  Can they just put in some seats that have like little padding so your feet don't get cold?  You're tootsies. 
[00:16:30]  You're always thinking, Jim.  Well, it's a small venue.  I mean, I think they only do like what?  17,000, 18,000.  Well, that's pretty big.  Yeah, I mean, it's comparable to the Garden.  Is it really?  Mm-hmm.  It looks different.  Sure, for concerts, for the Garden?  Yeah, I think the Garden's only like 18.  Okay.  He was telling me that that was the most people they've ever had on Friday night.  Oh.  Because Pearl Jam uses the entire arena.  They sell the seats in the back, too.  Oh, yeah.  And he said that most times, like corporate tickets go unused. 
[00:17:00]  But he said this time, like almost every seat was filled.  And I've got to tell you, the people at the Barclays, or is it Barclay?  Barclay.  Barclay.  Barclay.  Barclay.  Barclay.  I hate that.  The Barclay.  The Barclay.  Barclay.  They couldn't have been nicer.  Yeah, they got good.  Every single person working there was nice, went out of their way, made sure you were comfortable,  made sure you knew where you were going.  And I noticed that at Yankee Stadium as well.  Yeah.  So there's a new trend where people are becoming nicer. 
[00:17:30]  Courtesy?  Wow.  Yeah, actual courtesy is coming back.  Like over-the-top courtesy, where you're almost not annoyed, but you're like, all right,  I'm good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're the fifth person.  Just trying to get to my seat.  There's a lot to be said about customer service.  I like it.  Because, you know, customer service in general sucks.  We all know that.  We get the tweets every day just from this company.  Oh, from this jernt.  That's for sure.  So then the hipster weekend continued with a little Banksy yesterday.  Banksy hit our neighborhood, Jim Norton. 
[00:18:00]  Did he?  Yeah.  Where?  79th between Broadway and Amsterdam.  Just off Broadway, really.  Wow, that's close.  And Travis was nice enough to text me that, hey, man, he hit in your neighborhood.  And I went over there.  It's kind of cool.  What time did you go?  There.  That's...  Actually, you got to do the other picture because I fucked up my...  That's actually pretty cool.  Huh?  That's a cool...  That's pretty cool.  Well, see, it's like a little carnival thing.  A little boy with a fucking...  How do you know that it's...  Oh, wow.  How do you know that that's him?  Oh, he posted it.  He posted and said, all right, this is where I went. 
[00:18:30]  And I don't know.  He's creating some...  He's creating cool shit because people come out and everyone's festive and happy and they  all are taking their pictures and checking it out.  Is the mayor still after his ass?  Of course.  Well, I mean...  He's trying to say he's not, but he is.  They want to catch this guy so bad.  I don't think they do.  I think he was just answering a question at a press conference.  I mean, I...  Aside from, like, the vandal unit, like, they don't have, like, uniformed cops, like, out 
[00:19:00]  looking for him, you know?  Right.  And somebody else...  I think Gothamist interviewed, like, a former person on the vandal squad.  He's like, unless, like, somebody that owns a building makes a complaint, he hasn't  done anything criminal.  Right.  You know?  And nobody's complained yet.  Well, I'm complaining for the cities.  For my eyes.  Jimmy.  You're the one.  And everyone was being cool, like, it's like a semicircle, so you get a cool shot.  But, of course, when I was there, this fucking old lady had to be so close to take her pictures. 
[00:19:30]  And she was there forever getting a million, million pictures.  So that's why she's in my shot.  So annoyed.  You have a shot of that lady in Banksy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Maybe the lady's Banksy.  You never know, right?  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah.  Oh.  Building owners put this one behind Plexiglas last night.  Which one?  Yes.  This one.  The other one that you guys saw?  Oh, they got some Plexiglas up.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  So let's go scratch that shit.  Put some Scratch-Eady on it.  Let's go Scratch-Eady.  Wait, that's not the one.  Where is that?  That's on 79th.  Why does that thing look different?  Something looks different.  It's filtered through Instagram.  Oh.  Why would you Instagram filter it?  Yeah.  Why not just fucking put it like it is?  Why do you filter an artist's colors?  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree with you.  I'll take a picture of the Mona Lisa and filter it.  Oh, I did.  Oh.  I'll put a Yankee hat on her.  Oh.  Yeah.  When we're taking our shitty pictures of whatever, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Filter that shit.  Filter it.  I like sepia.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, the old bag in there.  Yeah, she just fucking wouldn't move.  Aw.  And look at her.  She's running away.  She has to be five feet away from the whole fucking thing.  Is she laying down?  Yes.  It's not even like she's got a good camera where she's getting, like, real quality shots  or anything. 
[00:21:00]  What a selfish old twirl.  Hopefully she's dead today.  I like that old bag.  It was kind of cool to be that close to a Banksy.  Ooh.  Did you touch it?  A real Banksy.  I didn't touch it.  Of course it goes through your mind, like, ah, maybe I should be the asshole that fucks  this up.  I think everyone thinks that, though.  Just standing there like, man, all right, maybe I can go get some spray paint and just  be the asshole.  Because someone here is going to be the asshole.  Somebody tried to do it yesterday.  They did?  Yeah.  The crowd did not like that.  Again? 
[00:21:30]  Had someone try to do it?  Somebody saw some guy coming up with a spray paint can, and a bunch of people in the crowd  stopped him from getting any closer.  I hope that they did.  You can't get caught doing it, because then you really look like an idiot.  Yeah.  I'm going to spray it.  I mean, if they want to tackle you after you do it, that's all right.  But you can't be caught as you're approaching with a spray paint can.  You look like an idiot.  I hope one of those guys gets their jaws broken or gets their face sprayed. 
[00:22:00]  For being an asshole, right?  Just ruining cocksuckers they are.  Yeah.  They're Twitter.  You know what they are?  They're Twitter people.  Yeah.  That's who they are with the spray can.  Yeah, you paint the nail.  And to the people that just were obsessed that I actually filmed two lousy videos at  the Pearl Jam show, relax.  I saw most of the show.  You were getting some shit.  They couldn't even let that go.  Why don't you put your camera down and just enjoy it? 
[00:22:30]  It was a three-hour show.  I filmed two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs.  It was probably a total of seven minutes of filming.  But people had to be obsessed with that, too.  You watched just about three hours of Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  But they were upset that you didn't watch those songs.  Because I guess they assumed I filmed the whole concert.  The whole concert.  Why would I do that?  You're there for three hours.  You're like, you know what?  I'm going to fucking film this one.  And I'm going to film this one. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Twitter fucking people.  Put your phone down.  Why does it matter to you?  Why do you fucking give a shit?  Why does it matter to you?  Oh, this isn't going viral.  Maybe I just want the video on my stupid channel.  And if people enjoy it, great.  If not, what are you going to do?  I'm putting it up there for myself.  Huh?  Pearl Jam fans appreciate that.  Pearl Jam fans did not appreciate the person who posted the photo of your set list on the message board. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, really?  I was a little worried about that.  They have set list threads on Pearl Jam's message board where people follow the show along.  And somebody posted the photo that you posted.  Oh, really?  Yes.  And they were none too pleased that spoilers were released.  But can't you tell immediately that it's a set list and maybe you just don't read the words?  Somebody brought a pumpkin to the banks.  That's pretty cool.  That's what I wanted to do. 
[00:24:00]  And the guy with his head on the thing is pretty cool on the paper.  I'd put a nuclear bomb there.  Dude, that's what I was going to do.  I was going to do the pumpkin thing.  But I'm like, I'm going to look like an asshole.  What, am I going to walk up and put a pumpkin on?  The guy who bought the pumpkin then went to return the pumpkin because it cost $7.  No.  Yeah.  How can you return a pumpkin?  I'd go to a grocery store and say, I'd change my mind.  Cheap fuck.  $7.  Who takes a pumpkin back?  It's like returning fruit.  Yeah.  Once you buy fruit.  I've got to say.  You bite it, you bought it. 
[00:24:30]  You bite it, you bought it.  It's kind of cool because this guy is very mysterious, this Banksy.  And all of a sudden he appears in the neighborhood.  He does this and he's gone.  And then everyone just kind of hangs out all day long checking it out.  It's sweeping the city.  Yeah.  When does he leave?  November 1st, you fun ruiner.  Really?  I'm kidding.  I think it's fun.  You think it's a curmudgeon?  Yes.  I'm a curmudgeon.  Stick in the mud.  If you were close yesterday, would you have walked over and checked it out? 
[00:25:00]  Sure.  It's a pop culture thing going on.  It's an event.  Why not?  I yelled at the old lady, though.  I'm like, hey!  Get out of the fucking way!  Get out of the fucking picture other people in here, you self-centered twat!  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  Yeah, you like him so much you have him paint your house.  Me?  I don't want to look at it.  A lot of people like to have their dogs in the photos with these.  I use Charlie to paint.  He comes in and does all the ceilings.  Yeah, you want to go to Banksy?  How about you put some money in for me? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, he's real good with that.  Stents, I like seeing him with a roller.  See if he can roll a room in 15 minutes like my buddy Charlie.  Honest days work.  He's an artist I can appreciate.  Remember a few years back?  It's probably like six or seven at this point.  Oh, God, yes.  The gates of Central Park.  The gates.  I didn't appreciate that artist.  I'm sorry.  But I'm not going to be a Bloomberg and go, that's not art.  I put up a bunch of frames.  I thought that one was ridiculous, but I did check it out.  Curtains on it. 
[00:26:00]  You thought it was cool?  Yeah, I mean, it was okay.  It made the park look nice for people.  Well, in the middle of winter, and we had a snowstorm,  so the contrast between the white snow and the orange gates was terrific,  but I don't know.  Isn't there a video of Tony Danza roller skating or something?  And he hit one of the fucking...  Oh, right.  You remember that?  Tony Danza.  Tony was a good guest.  I didn't understand the orange gates, even though I, like I said, I checked it out. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, there he is.  Was that for his TV show?  Yeah.  I think it was.  When he had the TV show.  Yeah.  It doesn't happen.  That was an extravidanza.  Did you check out the gates?  And people just walk in and around Central Park, I'll never forget,  and they're like, oh, oh.  I think I've been in Central Park a total of three times in my entire life.  No, I did not check the gates out from Central Park.  I think I was staying at the Park of Meridian or something,  and had a park view, and I saw it from the window. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, you start walking through them, and you're like, oh, okay.  All right, great.  Yeah, then it's just...  Now what?  It's one of those now what situations.  Yeah, yeah, now what?  Well, I guess we could walk through more of them.  All right, we'll do that.  Oh, they're around the pond.  You want to go down there and walk through those?  All right.  Let's go get some hot chocolate.  I don't know.  The gates.  I guess I understand why it's art, but I'd rather check out the Banksy stuff. 
[00:27:30]  That shit's kind of cool.  It's quick.  It's small.  It's not a big extravagant thing.  No.  The gates.  And every day, something else is popping up.  Somewhere else.  He put together a little art gallery.  Oh, that was great.  That was one of the first people there.  Wow.  Yeah.  Travis checked out that one.  That was Friday.  It was all weekend.  All weekend?  But it started on Friday.  On West 24th, underneath the High Line.  So why can't you make believe you're like a construction guy and go, all right, I've got to take this down?  He reportedly paid 50 grand for that. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  Somebody what, guard it?  He paid for a gallery actually owns that space.  So he paid for the space, and then the gallery had to get permits, and they had to hire security guards.  Oh, wow.  And he set up a little art gallery.  Two pieces?  Yeah, two pieces.  Is it nice?  Oh, yeah.  I saw those are pretty cool.  With one of those museum benches.  Art museum benches in front.  Yeah.  Banksy.  He does interesting stuff, though.  He gets attention.  He's got everyone talking. 
[00:28:30]  That's kind of cool, no?  Yeah.  There's a picture.  Complete with refreshments.  I've been drawing stick figures all over.  No one notices.  On my website, I'm posting.  Here's another stick figure.  I'm going to start doing that.  Yeah.  Just see if it takes off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our Jets won yesterday.  Yes.  I know Jimmy's a big Jets fan.  Oh, he was very excited.  And certainly Anthony is as well.  Lee Jet Green.  Yeah, Jet Green, of course.  That was a good call, too.  I don't like that bullying. 
[00:29:00]  Look.  I don't like it.  And people were attacking me over that yesterday.  I'm like, look, I'll be the first to tell you.  I'm happy the Jets won, but I think this new rule is complete bullshit.  Pretty stupid.  It held my team out yesterday, but it's a dumb rule, I think.  Because everyone is piled up to begin with when it's a field goal.  So everyone just pushes forward.  So what, the new rule is you can't push your own guy forward?  It's ridiculous.  And why?  Why is that?  Why did they decide after all these years that's a dumb thing to do? 
[00:29:30]  You can't push your teammate into the opponent's formation.  Why, though?  When was this?  When did they decide this is a problem?  In the offseason.  No, I understand.  This is the first time it's ever been called.  But why?  Why did they decide?  We really need to make this rule.  Yeah, was there a big problem with that happening?  Why can't you spin the football anymore after you score touchdown?  How is that on sportsmen?  Like, you're pushing through to get the guy.  Like, I don't see that being honest.  See, it was kind of an uncomfortable win.  Because it's like, oh, really?  We won because of that? 
[00:30:00]  Every team gets those shit calls, though.  Oh, I know.  Every team gets a weird one here and there.  But it's like, first of all, the field goal was, what, 55, 56 yards?  That was 56, yeah.  56-yard field goal.  And they're calling this new rule for the first time, I think.  First time it's been called, right?  Yep.  And that didn't affect the kick at all.  That's what I'm getting at.  And, you know, it wasn't a chip shot.  Oh, fuck.  You know, it was a very long field goal.  I think that was going to tie folks' career best, I believe.  15-yard penalty? 
[00:30:30]  And then it's like, it just felt a little uncomfortable, but I'm just pretty, I'm happy.  The amount of breaks that the Patriots get over the years.  I know, I know they have, I know.  Have they gotten some breaks?  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  They've won like six in a row against the Jets.  Were they pissed?  Did they show the sideline, the pass sideline?  Were they, like, pissed?  Belichick did not like the call.  But he always looks pissed.  Yeah, but that's true.  Even when he wins, he looks pissed.  It's just a rough call.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  And the push wasn't even that.  The push wasn't even that.  No, I saw it.  It was like, if everyone's moving forward, how can you tell if the guy behind another guy 
[00:31:00]  is actually pushing him or just trying to get through?  They should, I mean, they should absolutely allow that on a field goal.  Yes.  When everyone is spread out, whatever.  But you got everyone crunched into the middle.  Like, everyone just pushes forward.  It's one big fucking wall.  Two walls going at it.  Well, this guy seems to know why they changed the rule.  Oh, why?  They just did everything they could that would blow that game.  He's like, uh...  Did they?  Yeah.  I'm going on the foul in Virginia.  What's up, Al? 
[00:31:30]  What's up, Bo?  Why did they change the rule?  Or make that rule?  Well, the rule, basically, it's a player requests a rule.  They wanted to change the rule because the players themselves were getting injured, tearing  knees, ankles, piling on top of each other.  Yeah, remember, these are fucking 350-pound linemen on a 200-pound long snapper or any other  kind of special team that was just trying to get a job, you know, playing in the NFL.  So, they requested this rule.  They granted that rule. 
[00:32:00]  And now they're getting bit in the ass for it.  All right.  Wouldn't, if you were on one of these teams, go, look, can you please not push me?  I don't want to...  Don't push me.  I don't want to injure my knee.  Yeah, of course.  Fair enough, Al.  Fair enough.  I didn't even know that was going on.  Like, you were just shoving the guy in front of you.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Like, hey, go get him.  That's all I'd be doing.  Hide behind big guys and push me.  Yes.  Let's get him.  Let's get him.  Well, now we know.  Thanks, Al.  Thanks, Al.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  I didn't realize a lot of guys are getting hurt in that situation. 
[00:32:30]  So, they're trying to protect the players a little more.  Very injured.  But, I mean, look, we're looking at it on deadspin right now.  It doesn't even look good.  It doesn't really look like that much of a push, really, even.  I think this ref was kind of like, hey, I want to use this new rule and just look at the  whole game just looking for it.  And that's close enough.  And then my other team that I love, the Broncos.  I didn't stay up, though.  Fucking the Colts beat the Broncos yesterday. 
[00:33:00]  Peyton's first time, I believe, back in Indianapolis, right?  Yes.  And he lost to Andrew Luck and the boys.  Oh, yeah?  That's their first loss of the year.  That was the only other football game I cared about.  And I didn't get to stay up for the whole fucking thing.  So, you like the Broncos, eh?  I bleed Bronco orange.  You do?  Blue.  What?  Blue.  Oh.  That, too.  They have a little orange in there.  Yeah.  They used to be all orange, didn't they?  They have the orange uniforms sometimes.  Oh, see?  That's the one. 
[00:33:30]  That's when I bleed.  That's what?  Okay.  Look, there's some orange.  There's some orange right there.  Yeah, there's some orange on it.  A little orange.  There's a border on their numbers.  That's orange.  Yeah, I know.  That's all.  I just get a little bit of blood on me.  Jimmy's Cowboys won.  Yeah.  I only found out because Keith Twittered something about the Eagles fans get your money.  Like, lined up for him.  So, that's the only reason I know that they won.  But good for them.  Well, you were too busy bleeding Jets green.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's true.  You've got to bleed Jets green.  Did they have Romo dough?  Huh?  Had Romo dough.  He had a good game? 
[00:34:00]  I don't even know.  That's good.  I hope he did for his sake.  I'd love to see him have a good year.  Jets got a quarterback finally, man.  I'm very fucking happy.  Fuck Sanchez.  Sanchez, I think, got his shoulder operating on him.  Yeah, he's out.  He's out for the year.  And then I'm sure they'll fucking either release him or trade him.  Got a nice Italian guy, Gino.  Gino Smith.  That's right.  Nice Italian fella.  That's right.  And then you've got a Jets fan punching a Patriots chick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[00:34:30]  Did you see this?  Oh, boy.  Some big lug.  A big lug in Jets jersey.  Dex female fan in MetLife Stadium.  Pop some chick in the head that's wearing a...  Wait, can we see that?  I can't see it.  Is that the aftermath?  No.  Where is he?  There.  She gets right up in him and he fucking...  Wham!  Oh, shit.  She ran right up in his face.  But she aggressively ran...  She aggressively ran up into his face and pushed him pretty hard. 
[00:35:00]  Look.  Yeah, he...  Oh!  And she didn't even fall.  She's fucked up.  She took that punch.  He might have fucking, like...  You cocksucker!  They might have pulled that punch a little bit.  Yeah, but what is he supposed to do?  She came up and just shoved...  The guy looks like a dick, but she did just shove this guy.  I don't know.  Maybe shove her back instead of punching her in the face.  He gave her a little fucking love tap.  You don't think he hit her full force?  Well...  If he hit her full force...  No.  He didn't hit her full force.  I don't know.  I mean, it's a good shot, though.  And the guy punched him back and he's not even... 
[00:35:30]  Fuck, he's still smiling.  The guy's hitting him.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy's just fucking...  He's probably drunk off his ass.  Just a big dopey Jets fan.  Yeah, yeah.  I think...  Dolt.  I think we've discussed it on our show.  There are women out there that will be very aggressive knowing that, you know,  we're not supposed to hit him.  She fucking takes that punch.  Yeah, she's fine.  If she's a Pats fan, her boyfriend probably does that all the time.  Jesus.  Where's my beer, darling?  What was the big melee about? 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  He was...  She aggressively went toward him.  And shoved him.  I'm sure he was fucking...  Here's what I think.  They're walking out after the game, right?  Is that when...  This was after the game?  The fight started in the stands with two girls fighting.  Moved out to where I shot the video.  Beer was thrown in clothing over the balcony.  Security went after the guy.  Didn't see what happened after that.  Oh, okay.  Hmm.  A lot of shit talking going on.  Usually you get the shit talking and then the girl will be, um...  Fuck you! 
[00:36:30]  Fuck you!  Yeah, yeah.  Deadspin says, what do you expect from a Jamoke in a Jets jersey and green camouflage pants?  There you go.  What's he supposed to do when she pushes him, though?  Push him back.  Yeah, but still, she shouldn't...  Say, excuse me.  Yeah.  I don't appreciate that.  And I'm turning the other cheek.  There you go.  No, but if you understand...  Yes.  I don't want to see a woman get punched in the face.  She was aggressive there.  She ran...  I don't know what led up to this, but she ran right up to him and pushed him pretty hard.  She ran and shoved him.  And he could handle that, obviously.  It wasn't unprovoked.  Oh, I'm sure it wasn't. 
[00:37:00]  Damn.  Well, I mean, you saw it.  She went up to him.  If a man did that to him, he would have punched him.  Sure.  All right.  Well, then don't run up and push a fucking six-foot-five guy, stupid girl.  Shit.  Well, women do that because they know we're not supposed to hit him.  That's true.  This guy said, fuck that.  Absolutely.  This guy said, fuck that.  Fuck that.  He was going to penalize her because somebody was pushing her forward.  Yeah, someone pushed her forward.  She bet the odds and did not.  There's a new rule.  You can punch her in the face.  She didn't like it.  I keep lost.  I know it.  It is ridiculous.  And we have to point it out again. 
[00:37:30]  The mainstream media.  I've been watching this clip all morning.  This is the first time I've seen the longer clip.  They're not showing the longer clip because it makes a much better story to just see this  Jamoak punching a woman.  They don't show the part where she runs up and pushes him really hard.  Yeah, they really only show the part where he punches her.  I don't think he should have punched her, but there's more to the story that they're not  showing you on.  CNN just did a whole piece on it.  They didn't show her running up and pushing the guy. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, wow.  No.  And in the papers, same thing.  That's what they're worried about.  That one dump.  How many times have there been fucking, you know, 10 on one videos of someone getting  their head kicked in and the press is not this outraged about it?  Fuck her.  Who knows?  I shouldn't say it.  It might have been his fault.  I might have been.  Yeah, she might have been reacting to something shitty he did.  They'll get him.  And then the Daily News has a still and says, and they have, it just says, do you know this 
[00:38:30]  tough guy?  A tough guy?  They're trying to find this tough guy.  Yeah.  The Daily News article doesn't even say, like, she provoked it.  No.  No.  I mean, all I'm saying is you probably want the whole story out there.  No, because it doesn't.  I don't think you should have hit her, you know, anyway.  But.  It doesn't matter.  But they're leaving out some facts.  It doesn't matter because under no circumstances are you supposed to strike a woman. 
[00:39:00]  That's the, you know.  No matter what she does or she hits you first.  Right.  It's just nonsense.  Because she's a delicate flower and he's a big bruiser.  You know.  Jamoke.  Yeah.  A jamoke.  I personally.  You never want to be called a jamoke.  I personally wouldn't hit a woman, you know.  I would do whatever I need to defend myself, you know.  You throw up some blocks.  Maybe you grab the wrists with the one hand. 
[00:39:30]  You know, you could do that thing where you grab the wrist between your thumb and your pointer finger.  Finner.  And then you take your middle finger and you can wrap around and make little handcuffs.  Yeah.  With that.  Yeah.  So then you can use the other hand and fucking smack her in the face.  No, I'm kidding.  Of course.  Don't do that.  Break the wrist, walk away.  But you can do it.  Break the wrist, walk away.  Break the wrist, walk away. 
[00:40:00]  I love that one.  Wait, is that the Helen Hunt, Paul Reiser show?  Exactly.  Red Sox are in the World Series.  I would love to, you know, play the what do the Sox say.  Oh, my God.  Remember on Friday I said.  That's probably right in front of you.  Remember on Friday I said maybe we should leave it laying around because we might want to play it a couple more times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we don't have that.  Here comes Eric.  He's all mad. 
[00:40:30]  Look at you.  Look at you.  What's he doing?  He just put both hands up to his face like this.  Because I think he's really frustrated because he knows I'm right.  And he just stomped down the hall begrudgingly.  Yeah.  They were losing 2-1, weren't they, to Detroit?  That's the last I saw the other night.  Oh, they're in the World Series against the Cardinals.  Is he disappointed in himself?  I think so. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I think he's mad.  He knows he's drunk.  That he didn't bring...  Mondays are tough.  For everyone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to give everyone a little leeway on a Monday.  Someone tweeted me an article on the Sox song where they had an interview and the guy was talking about how he was inspired and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, come on.  Iraq, I was right, right?  Are you mad?  Iraq?  No, I'm mad at myself.  No, that's what I'm saying.  See?  How come it wasn't there?  What, were you mad at himself? 
[00:41:30]  You want to play it?  Yes.  And I don't want to lose all the Jocktober stuff, so I keep putting it all away.  Oh.  I keep forgetting to put it out.  Yes, don't lose that precious bounty.  We're going to get to you a little bit, Iraq.  Iraq had a fine weekend with food.  Did he?  Fine in what way?  Roland went to some ridiculous food thing.  Oh, him and Roland?  A two-day food thing.  Oh, bro.  Three-day?  Was it three days?  Roland was there Friday night.  That's crazy.  They were trying to figure out who has the best hamburger in the city, and I guess Guy Fieri won or tied. 
[00:42:00]  No, he won.  I think he tied, though, with another guy.  I thought he won.  Wasn't it co-winners or something?  Ronald McDonald?  Our pal Guy Fieri.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  He did tie.  He tied, right?  Yeah.  With Josh Capone, I guess.  Where's his burger in that place on 42nd Street?  I don't know.  Well, no, this was like a food and some wine and food and cool guy.  Can we stop enough with the fucking foodies and the obsession with, 
[00:42:30]  This guy's got the best cracker jacks.  Sit down, fucking eat this shit, and go home.  Enough of it.  These guys are not rock stars.  Hey, chef, get me a burger.  Chop.  Tell that to Roland.  Roland got all sorts of photos.  All of a sudden, the chefs are these fucking big stars now.  It's so ridiculous.  Fucking cunts in their aprons and their fucking Asperger's attitude.  Shut up.  Get me some string beans.  It's because there's like 20 chef shows on TV. 
[00:43:00]  The slobs figured out how to class it up, and now they're called foodies.  Right.  Foodies.  See, now it's cool that I eat ridiculously.  Yeah, yeah.  How did that happen?  I was going to add a word after ridiculously and then realize ridiculously was perfect.  He tied for the People's Choice Award.  Oh, really?  At the New York City Wine and Food Festival.  Yeah, Wine and Food Festival.  Three days.  You know what, though?  Everyone gives him shit that he's, you know, the rock and roll guy, but he makes a damn  good burger. 
[00:43:30]  I love Guy Fieri.  Oh, man.  I wouldn't mind having one of his burgers.  Don't get me wrong.  They're fantastic.  I'm all in with Guy Fieri and his rock and roll.  You like that?  Yeah.  I saw a picture of him.  Where was it?  In the paper, maybe, recently?  Or online?  He was doing the, you know, the devil horns, rocking the devil horns with some other guy next  to him, and he's like, yeah!  I was just, I looked at him and started laughing.  Like, here he is!  What was that great Guy Fieri tweet that we were laughing at on Friday?  Oh, God.  Oh. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  I don't want to fuck it up.  Yeah, I don't recall.  He walks around like he's, no.  Like he, I don't know.  Can you find it online?  It's probably.  That would be impossible.  You think?  Because the tweet almost went viral.  It was funny.  Basically referring to him as a sports bar.  A walking sports bar or something.  But I don't, I forgot the exact tweet.  It was perfect.  It was a perfect way to describe Guy Fieri.  Is his restaurant still here?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Is he doing well?  I don't know.  It's a tough spot.  There's a lot of real estate there.  I mean, it's time square.  He's got to make a big, huge fucking number every month.  Big nut.  That's a big fucking nut.  Big nut every month.  He's got to pay at time square.  That's why those restaurants, you know, they're in a tough spot around time square.  Yeah.  A lot of money.  A lot of money.  That's why the camera place charges $35 for that fucking ethernet cable.  That's right.  $35.  I just went, no.  Bastard.  Oh, yeah.

[00:51:00]  a lot of our careers but someone posted a picture over the weekend do you remember when some chick  was wrapped up in toilet paper like oh i posted that no that was you yeah i updated oa photos over  the weekend with a bunch of stuff oh but someone else tweeted and made it i felt like it was some  other site but okay it's oa photos photos you did toilet photos on twitter you should uh follow that  account because it's old school shit you did toilet paper mummy do you remember doing this for rodney  dangerfield rodney dangerfield yeah i'll say well he kind of did already but rodney dangerfield's in 
[00:51:30]  studio yeah and all of a sudden we had a girl who was just wrapped up in toilet paper and that's  all she had on do you remember doing this um be honest i have no memory and her nipples are like  cut out well then we started like you know ripping the toilet paper away and and like one one boob is  sticking out now we got two boobs sticking out and then and and now we get now her vagina i don't  remember this at all wow that's a nice puss and then her puss from behind and there's rodney

[01:00:30]  let's have things uh so bad i got a problem with this eminem thing for real why they're melting in  your hands see he's under fire for more homophobic lyrics uh-oh look man as a society we have decided  to embrace the gay right we love the gay but we love the gay but we don't embrace people  not being for the gay right you should be able to say you're not for the gay can you no you're really 
[01:01:00]  not allowed to say that you can't or they go after you you can't voice your opinion look we're for the  gay on this radio show but i'm also for eminem being able to have homophobic fucking lyrics if he  wants i'll tell you one thing i do get a little skeevy when they start kissing yeah the kiss is a  little rough when they got two men like fucking like making out forward the video hey yeah i know  the goodness is coming yeah that all that gets you like oh gee and then they had um i guess cory 
[01:01:30]  booker uh as a mayor you see the one couple of whatever he is what is he now i don't know he's like  a senator or something yeah yeah you see the one uh lesbian couple no but the one gal was  dressed and looked like a guy dude so i don't know yeah i get really confused by the whole thing  because it's like i think if i was a lesbian i wouldn't want my lesbian partner to look like a guy 
[01:02:00]  that's a whole weird thing they got going there like he was dressed he was dressed at he see i'm  even saying she was dressed in a traditional like uh you know male suit yeah with a male haircut  uh and i i was confused at first because i'm like wait i thought he was marrying you know gay  couples and then this person turned around like oh okay yeah female that wants to look like a guy  that's such a weird fucking thing yeah very confusing cory booker was doing uh weddings at midnight 
[01:02:30]  uh because i guess jersey is allowing um some gay weddings or something gay marriage christy's not into  it right christy isn't into it so uh cory booker salad yeah exactly cory booker's really into it  and uh it was just i don't know when you when you see the guy it's like you may kiss your spouse  and then the guys just start kissing you like ah as a guy there's just this reaction this  fucking primal reaction that you look and just ah it's hard to watch yeah yeah and and it's not it has 
[01:03:00]  nothing to do with being anti-gay or anything it's just this a normal physical kind of reaction  sometimes even watching straight you know people kiss could be well yeah but it's a little rough  it's different it's not you're not you're not repulsed by the same for the same reason right  it's just a weird fucking thing i don't know so you so you got the eminem and he's got some  homophobic lyrics and and people going after him why he's not allowed to sing about it he can't 
[01:03:30]  dancing uh about the gay what does he say that's actually uh homophobic the same stuff he said  what does he say about the gays he just uses gay as an insult boy that boy is gay little gay  looking boy you gay so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy you're witnessing  massacre like you watching a church gathering taking place looking boy oy vey that boy's gay that's all  they say looking boy you take a thumbs up pat on the back the way you go from your label every day 
[01:04:00]  looking boy uh he says fags saying he says fags and he's brilliant we're we're not smart enough to  understand him i guess you do know that right he's yeah brilliance he's just brilliance it's the same  stuff you know when he was what even though i walk in the church burst in a ball of flames only hall of  fame i'd be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame alcohol figs think it's all a game 
[01:04:30]  till walk a flock of flames until i walk a flock of flames what there's a rapper name what is he trying  oh he had some problems with some gang members whatever i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts  while i'm practicing that i'll still be able to break a motherfucking table no he's he's a  you want to break a table he's a fake tough guy he talks about all this stuff he's going to do but  he really does break a table over the back of a couple of faggots crack it in half only realized 
[01:05:00]  it was ironic gay bashing i was signed to aftermath after the fact no he's referring to somebody  specifically i think oh boy he's going he's going after somebody right yeah it sounds to me like he's  referring to somebody off a couple of faggots he's not saying random gays i think he's talking about  these two guys whoever it is he's who are the two guys and he also remembers what got him so much  press the first time yeah exactly it does seem a little shitty though like a little like a little  silly like you know you know you didn't mind singing with elton john and elton john fuck him 
[01:05:30]  that's fucking creepy way he bashed kinnison for gay jokes right once again that's fine you know kill  the comic for the fucking jokes but then eminem he fucking sang at the grammys with that year whatever  it was yeah they had a whole thing yeah yeah i wonder how elton john is feeling today boy george  is not happy well the lyrics are a little rough to be completely honest with you but you know what's  boy george saying what is he's just that his lyrics are homophobic who cares who cares whatever 
[01:06:00]  i was watching a very interesting documentary over the weekend about uh nambla oh boy yeah we editing it  oh boy i think it was from 89 something it was an old one yeah and um they were in washington marching  with uh a gay like a gay pride week thing and it was big you know all factions of gay lifestyle and  everything were out there and the gay people were just like we don't want anything to do with them 
[01:06:30]  they were fucking repulsed and they they brought out the big uh nambla banner and they're walking with  it and the gays just were like no we want nothing to do with them uh yeah well a lot of people were  saying that they they should have been uh beaten and uh absolutely but but then there were people  like they got the right to at least speak when they act on these things but sure it was uh it it was 
[01:07:00]  one of the not maybe not even one of it could possibly be the creepiest thing i've ever watched  wow there's a segment in there where some guy is driving in his car and he's all smiling and he's  talking about seducing these fucking young boys and he's so delusional in thinking they're flirting with  him he like he's talking about how they come up to me and start talking and i know like that's their  way of and he gets out of the car and goes to this uh like a an ice cream place or some 
[01:07:30]  shit of course and there's some boy on a bicycle and they're fucking around with a payphone and he  starts talking to the kid and the kid's just answering his dumb fucking creepy guy questions  and when he goes back to his car he talks about it he goes see see i was feeling it out and there was a  there was a thing there every fucking time there was some thing there that the guy can always tell  oh really uncle paul yes that's the one you're a bigot it's called chicken hawk chicken hawk men who 
[01:08:00]  love boys oh it's from 94 good people look at him there were this guy he likes boys this guy yeah  that guy's uh uh a fucking uh a federal lawyer and he's also like in charge of the  correspondence for nambla oh look at this fucking just a ghoul and then at the end of that you could  tell where this documentary was gone at the end of it they just put everyone's name they went through  every guy from nambla that they interviewed and just put their name at the bottom oh good here you 
[01:08:30]  go laugh at it what can we find a clip that is worth playing on the show the guy find the guy in the  yellow sweater driving his car is that jerry it's how far in was it uh it was about halfway through maybe  okay maybe maybe i remember him do you and then there's a teacher that was uh talking about nambla  that look at these fucking sketches that was a nice teacher talking about nambla that and he was  still teaching and then the board of education went oh this guy this guy is the biggest creep hi 
[01:09:00]  that's so bad yeah leland has graduate degrees in law and philosophy  he has been a mormon representative in texas and a missionary in hong kong  oh what's he done there india and was put in a california prison for this creepy smile he's just a  creep in his creepy sweater too everything about him is ghoulish 
[01:09:30]  he's driving to his cabin retreat in the mountains of west virginia what horrors have happened there  it's a cabin retreat that's why they just smile all the time because it's all lies and horrors  that are being hidden in their mind behind the smiles delightful amelia has oh yeah  rachel can i give you a little of this no just a little bit no landlord the old lady landlord who  doesn't see anything no she don't know she knows how to look the other way oh he's so nice with the 
[01:10:00]  children he brings over their screams of horror he took me to get my apples at the orchard and we  went on down to see the canaries and then see the birds a great day with that old in general there are  lots of boys that precisely want to do that that is what they want to do they make it clear and they  simply do it they make it clear that is to uh give a blowjob that's what to give head as the saying 
[01:10:30]  goes that's what they want to do and they do it that is this boy simply did it in a magnificently  gentle tender sort of way you could sense he was putting his whole life into this experience this is  going great that is what was so exceptional about it and uh it produced a uh remarkable sensation 
[01:11:00]  and well i may say a rather speedy climax  inside rather it was that boy shady what is this creepy yellow sweater what what thoughts come into your  mind in in such a time curiously the most powerful feelings that are evoked are religious feelings  of course they are praises to the almighty for having created anything so beautiful so spectacularly 
[01:11:30]  wonderful this is what is going on i think he's getting all worked up just talking yeah down next to  me and and that's the mother of one of the kids staring at anthony uh and that gave me the creeps i  mean he was just staring looking at him like he was a piece of meat up and down because anthony just  had a pair of shorts on he kept teased making excuses to pull up his shirt and show me his belly 
[01:12:00]  in a highly flirtatious way oh he sees everything as kids wanting to have sex with him that's right  it's not curable healing that's why they need to be locked up forever that's the kid  met him no i think that's the younger brother there's a 12 year old all right we didn't think  anything of it well obviously sure pull his hand away before leland released his grip my feeling is  that he was feeling jacob out you know to see if jacob was accepting to that kind of behavior 
[01:12:30]  her mother's just like my son in front of his and they were walking from my house to  to his friend's house and there's another mother just getting all upset and there's a father later  on that talks about how uh and they accepted they pretty much ran him out of town questions like  like all kinds of stupid questions and every time we say something to him you take out his paper  write it down mike on one occasion and anthony on another uh flirted with me i thought in a very 
[01:13:00]  flagrant but wonderful way by flagrant i mean they made this guy just needs to be eliminated yeah  just eliminated exterminated flirting in a sexual way why he's just telling it like he sees it  calls it like he sees it calling these kids out this was their nature because they were crazy eyes right  he's insane he's not blinking this aspect of their life of their he hasn't stopped smiling 
[01:13:30]  he's just destroyed families as he goes along in his wake are just destroyed families he doesn't see  it that way no and waiting you know for your child waiting for you maybe what if you what if you got  mad at your kid because he did something you know you grounded them you know so here he is he's feeling  bad and here comes boy does he fit the absolute profile yeah you know and and i think that's how  they work you know they prey on these children and how they can stand up and tell people what they 
[01:14:00]  believe in and that there's nothing that you can do about it i don't understand our judicial system  that's for sure yeah there's another bakery down there but he knows where to go where all the kids  italian food center sandwiches and catering okay this is where he talks with the young boy on the bicycle  and thinks he's flirting with him 
[01:14:30]  nice sweater you like that sweater uncle ball  that is just in the pedophile section that sweater right it has to be those slacks  oh no  he just walks over and starts talking to kids  look at this predator oh you made the phone ring oh let's see how you get that 
[01:15:00]  oh  they're just ignoring him oh no yeah yeah  five four three  three three look at how close he is yeah  hey not bad  hey how can i get the secret  dial 660  660 and who's the rest of it  the last four digits of that phone  oh that phone 660 plus the last four digits of that phone and that'll do it 
[01:15:30]  yeah but you can't leave anybody out  oh goodness okay that'll be our secret then  oh  he was so eager to tell me when  uh see he was so eager to tell me that  he sees every young boy he has a little liberaci in him  of course  and and obviously the kids are playing along because there's a camera crew yeah yeah the camera's there  that alone will make people talk every time yeah it'll be our secret like he like that turns him on 
[01:16:00]  to say oh yes uh oh  sorry building that connection with that young man yeah and now look at look at how he interpreted  that whole uh exchange all right listen to this our secret no that's on radio  he was so eager to tell me when his birthday was and he was going to be 15 in less than a month  on the first of december and uh this is what life is about this is what real life is about i would  say that he was in bloom and that's it the flower is uh responding to warmth that is 
[01:16:30]  everyone has a human being bathing him in a certain kind of celestial warmth and he feels that and  he responds to that and he thinks oh how nice how wonderful there's someone there who is appreciating  what i am and that leads to a blowjob why  right that that guy is 
[01:17:00]  fucking creepy he's a good guy oh you know him uncle sure i do we always go down there to the shop  and we go down to the bakery and grab some cupcakes oh yeah yeah i said hey make him show us how to do  the number oh we laugh oh sure you did sure our secret is um kids this is a little more of this guy left  please i want to see more foolishness with jason my first aim would be to get a feeling for his 
[01:17:30]  psychological space which i may say i did to uh while i was talking to him while i was with him i was  attempting to evaluate the degree to which he is neurotic most of the persons that i've worked with  who have offended against children i didn't feel did this with any kind of malicious intent at all 
[01:18:00]  i think some of them didn't see this developing they were drawn into the relationships in ways they  didn't recognize themselves i saw others who genuinely fell in love with the child i was really a romantic  attachment um i think few of them behave this way simply for sexual activity  his crazy car was out in the woods on one occasion yeah and uh met a boy in his early teens 
[01:18:30]  who was uh friendly open appealing  and i think he's getting turned on talking about this you hear him like he's he's gulping and  breathing heavy why would he agree to be part of this documentary he sees no problem he's not ashamed  he probably thinks this is going to be on every movie screen in america and then he recognizes that  guy and he thinks he'll get more takers i'm gonna get more boys because i'm in the movie i hear an accent 
[01:19:00]  from a guy that maybe he thinks it's for foreign countries or he probably thinks he's going to  change people's minds oh like he's probably like people are going to see this and see how beautiful  it is yes i literally hope somebody i hope somebody beat him to death after this yeah perhaps he is  dead who knows they don't give you an update where these guys are with their names at the end of the  documentary we can google yeah i don't know because google didn't exist when this one came out  they have another guy and it's he's the guy that would leave those messages that he's um he's like the head 
[01:19:30]  of nambler or something it was and he would be like be strong be proud to be a man lover they have  him in this documentary and he's in a building in his apartment building and there's just guys out  front with bullhorns you child rapist motherfucker get out here i'll fucking kill you and he's inside  going people do not understand that's great yeah it's a pretty good um documentary if you you turn me  on to a lot of documentaries i don't know if i'm gonna watch if you want to get creeped out i want 
[01:20:00]  to see the rest of this clip certainly this guy talks about uh his little story with this kid he  met on the beach and it's just horrendous and i and i've said it you know when i became a father  something turns on in your brain you know you see these fucking creeps now yeah when you walk around  manhattan i i see a lot of these guys and i guarantee at least nine out of the ten that i i'm suspicious  about are probably you know wanting to do something it's just the look they give your 
[01:20:30]  your kid when you're walking around uh manhattan that's what that mother was saying it's like he  was looking at it but it's her son like a piece of meat but before i had kids i didn't you know  but something turned on in my brain and i'm like holy i i say to myself so many times protection  instinct but i go holy that guy right there yeah yeah you just and i have no doubt my  fucking soul how often do you see him more than i more than i would fucking like i would assume  really you would think it would just be here once in a while but it's probably almost every day i walk 
[01:21:00]  around with my kids you just see it you just see the how deranged uh you know people could be watching  this is making me question like every adult that was ever friendly to me as a kid oh you were trying  the phone trick of course perfect you were perfect come on so molestable oh flipping that little  quarter off your ankle on that game show show me that oh yeah was probably trying to do it when i  met him in syracuse oh there was a young trying to get you the radio come on kid i remember a young 
[01:21:30]  boy named sam and he was of questionable ethnic background but uh we went together and flipped  coins he flipped it off his ankle i flipped it off my penis i'd listen to bcn with him he'd sit on my  lap cotton fuzz hairdo oh let's let's get to the end of this clip is he almost done this yeah yeah he's  got one more uh wing ding of a story here okay it's very responsive to my friendship and that is not 
[01:22:00]  only was his space open he wanted it to be open he wanted to share his life with me so share his life  of our friendship we went on a uh camping trip oh no not a camping trip arranged by him yeah he says  arranged by him as if it was a kid's idea it's yeah it's his idea it's arranged by him okay there's this 
[01:22:30]  this whole thing of like the kid is trying to uh get into some kind of relationship with this guy  well and maybe the kid did want to go camping but what happens is some of these kids have  fucking horrible home lines right right and they don't understand that this guy is a murderable  fucking disgusting predator they see an adult that takes interest in them and that's something they  don't get at home and he wants to take me camping that's great he's not thinking about 
[01:23:00]  fucking yeah yeah he thinks that he's just going to be loved and treated like a nice kid and this  guy's story is completely delusional like his his thinking that the kid is into this or anything  he's delusional yeah it's weird even calling this guy a predator feels weird because he he's like he  doesn't feel like he's he's just a psychopath yeah yeah believes what he's saying yeah i don't think  he absolutely i think he absolutely believes these kids are falling in love with him and uh you're  right jimmy that's what sam said they cannot be fixed there's one answer for people like this go 
[01:23:30]  look we know you didn't mean any harm put your head in here you must be absolutely uh exterminated  you have to be killed you're you're busted you're unfixable now if a guy like this is castrated will  that help or what how does that work no because i think the section the sexual part and he's even  talked about it in this dumb fucking documentary through the other guys the sexual part of it is uh  mental it's just a part of it part of it yeah it's part of it going up to kids at phone booths  right he likes the whole fucking seduction and the fucking you know having a little secret yeah that 
[01:24:00]  they he thinks they're falling in love with him and he's falling in love with them and he's just a  deranged psychopath that uh is a he's a horror he's a walking monster to uh anybody who has uh kids  it's like when you're in high school and you have that weird fantasy about the pretty girl falling  in love with you and you're gonna be that's what he thinks when he sees any boy but like it becomes 
[01:24:30]  a reality in his head yes yes he's rupert pupkin of fucking kids yeah which uh the intent was to  achieve intimacy this was his idea his idea and in order to further this idea  he arranged that the sleeping bags would be zipped together oh boy so that there would be no barrier to 
[01:25:00]  the creation of this experience now with appropriate affection and fondling and whatnot we passed the  night appropriate awakening in the morning he uh positioned himself in such a way that  nature would take its course oh no and he would experience thoughts within see see the kid's  probably pulling up he's like turned away from him and he sees it as he's pointing his ass at me yeah 
[01:25:30]  it's all ready to go the kid can feel the drool coming out of his mouth on the back of his neck  oh this is making me sick it's fucking it's it is it's fucking disgusting sick  himself a part of the body of his friend and so laying as he did on his side and 
[01:26:00]  uh producing the natural consequence of this event not natural i may say that he's getting all turned  on this was sufficiently stimulating that no lubricant was desired it was required that  nice nature that swamp ass produce its own hiking all day yeah that's nervous sweating  there was a kid shitting himself yeah it was his precum uh probably here comes the pre oh god oh god 
[01:26:30]  holy fucking shit everyone's horrified well you ought to just stop judging oh geez uncle it was natural in  the tent the hiney had a little residue on it oh god i put some earl on there you didn't need earl yeah i  did this guy don't i reached my two fingers into the sardine can and got a little earl  rubbed a little on the old helmet just to help the barrier get broken that's great the horrified 
[01:27:00]  faces of pelton it's unbelievable everyone's horrified i'm glad to see people i've seen out there here we go  he  experienced what he wanted to experience and i certainly on that occasion experienced something  that was very precious and fulfilling to me as well i'd probably kill him 
[01:27:30]  honest i probably would if he would have bothered my kids that's why one of the reasons i wanted him  away from here because he wouldn't seek any help to uh it looks like a movie character it does  and if uh if he would have got a hold of my kids it wouldn't be any good to kill him or a hundred of  them is he incognito here just kind of preventive medicine you might say looks like it's a wig  but whenever people start shooting at me or shooting at him with rifles around here i tell 
[01:28:00]  him he better get out of here before he got to kill him it's such you know with rifles uh various kinds  of threats of death see wiping the universe was saying it was time to move on at least for a while the  universe or your neighbors the townspeople chased him out of town like frankenstein yeah with  fucking pitchforks and torches people are so mad oh they are angry why they probably don't like  that this this guy's being painted so wrongly being persecuted they don't like that this guy 
[01:28:30]  can't just live a peaceful life in the woods we all we all either have kids or no kids they're  they're so outraged right now is this guy almost over i think that's pretty much it yeah i want to  hear how he moves yeah to bring this back another day another time another time no more drawings they  talk about them greek homos uh here they talk about how greece uh you know but at the end they show all  the um let's see all the names of them yeah is that one of them oh yeah oh they're all just the most 
[01:29:00]  hideous people in the universe ghoulish creeps yeah uh i want to know what this guy's name is and  if there's an update on him yeah right it's during the credits i think or yeah he's coming out before  the credits well maybe they knew their names they show their names there he is he's coming out okay  oh they show their faces yeah they show their faces and then the names they put the name underneath  their pictures let's google something yeah right see what see what happened to that guy that's what we 
[01:29:30]  we should definitely see what happened to him let's get his name it's coming out it's coming  out listen to the music they play for the ending credits you don't need creepy music you idiots  we're creeped out enough enough you don't have to pump it up hold on folks you better buckle your seatbelt  if anybody is watching this film and they think to themselves that they have control of things  because currently sex is suppressed and held to be dark and uh dreary and uh worthy of being suppressed 
[01:30:00]  sorry your day is over you might not understand it but i can tell you it's over and the signs are  present here and now what's happened is that this sexophobia this negativity this hysteria this  makes everybody feel like young people right except they're suppressing reality has been tightened down  now it has been screwed so tightly that i can tell you something young people it's about to break

[01:42:00]  pictures right away okay all right we got this is the new story of him being busted for child porn  yeah he was living in florida until 2007 okay uh and i guess they must have had a whole thing  trying to get this guy i'm sure everybody knew who it was because they had to get u.s marshal services  uh mr marshall with assistance from the county sheriff's office to get a search warrant and they searched  his house they didn't find anything but they found his car in like long-term parking at the airport  and they found a black zipper canvas bag inside the bag was clothing along with several photographs 
[01:42:30]  of nude adolescent males oh boy and pictures of a naked boy believed to be about eight to ten years  old performing a handstand in another picture uh a boy was uh 12 lying naked on a bed oh this guy they  figured out put the car in long-term parking and just go visit your car every once in a while  how creepy is that uh just sit in the parking lot jerking off i guess i guess every once in a while 
[01:43:00]  you just can't help yourself i gotta go i gotta go to long-term parking long-term parking so they were  looking well he probably knew they were looking for him boy this guy was what else does he already  careful huh uh just that one question he made no statement and then on the sex offender registry how did  he get out of that charge and move to india well it says on the sex offender registry that in 2007  he had had the charge and then was released and just made the register oh and so he was just not  in jail that was his uh major registry move but he got out of the country for a guy like that he 
[01:43:30]  don't know what i'm actually doing i mean that's not that technically he's not a child porn bust  naked people like that naked kids even if there's a weird thing where they got to be doing some  fucking promiscuous it was the charger's possession of child pornography okay but  how do you just let him out for that yeah and you would think that they had a videotape of him  saying all that yeah yeah yeah so then he uh he got out he registered and then he moved to india 
[01:44:00]  right because you don't have to register in india right oh and then he died in india in sri lanka  sri lanka so he was 69 in 2007. so he just died so he's probably 75 yeah geez lived an average life  oh he kind of proves there's no god huh dude hope yeah you got like this gets to a healthy 75. yeah  right after that documentary was filmed his car exploded burnt alive in there that would have been  nice people get hit by lightning every day you would think god could at least do that like well i'm going 
[01:44:30]  to hit people with lightning today i might as well take out some of these guys maybe he hasn't  maybe god has been yeah and he just missed this one no no maybe all those people that god takes out  yeah our fucking uh oh yeah you know we don't know we never know it like all those things we  feel bad with people on the news oh that poor guy see why he was a pedo we got uh bob levy on the line  here uh bobby what's up guys hey how can that the police not find these motherfuckers and lock them up  am i right they're on fucking websites telling people where they are i'm sure that i'm sure 
[01:45:00]  there's a whole thing going on where they're oh yeah they're watching you know i guess the resources  are a little thin and uh but it's kind of like radar it's kind of like when you had radar in your  car and you know what i mean and i'm doing something good and getting the fucking people  that are fucking molesting kids you also got to catch them saying you got to catch them saying  something uh uh that's that's specific and is what's the what's the word when you incriminate 
[01:45:30]  yourself it's gotta be you gotta catch them doing something oh yeah you can say anything you gotta  catch them what i want to say i was going back to when we all had radar in our cars and it was like  a little game you played with the you know the state trooper and you would find another way a  better fucking radar system and then they had to catch up and it's kind of what's going on with  this shit i bet and then someone figured out hey you know keep all your pictures in in a car and  long-term parking in an airport i'm sure that was a great day when someone posted that online for 
[01:46:00]  everybody if uh yeah if you notice what is what if you what would have you caught somebody  or that you'd fucking kill him in a second am i right hopey i mean you would fucking talk you  don't even have to ask the question of course i think a lot of people feel that way and these  fuckers are walking around you know what if some guy is dating a girl that's kind of underage what  happens to him he i'm sorry about this anthony but you go to jail never i never date underage 
[01:46:30]  no he fucks him and throws him out of the car you go to a fucking deal and these motherfuckers  are running around with nine-year-olds and ten-year-old fucking boys i think i could talk  for the authorities i'm i'm sure they were locking up a shitload of these guys but they can't get every  single one but i'm sure they're doing the best they can and uh you know and and getting a lot of  them i bet nothing brings them more joy than getting to lock up one of these people and then you know we  all heard uh you go to prison on one of these charges and you know that's where they have their 
[01:47:00]  own fucking moral code and prison beat the shit out of you yeah the kid thing is rough even with  hardcore are fucking inmates oh fucking unbelievable yeah this guy uh well hopefully he had a a  difficult life before it was difficult how did he say how he died didn't say a cause of death yeah  from natural causes 75 probably the fucking tsunami down there

[01:54:00]  weekend we're going through because of the diet coke uh clip which is now the latest and newest mike  francesa clip we're going through my history on youtube in the break and it was just francesa clip  after francesa mikey clips have we played this one on the air i don't know for sure uh but a minute of  it is just rejoiner music yeah and the best part is because mike francesi does his radio show in new  york but it's broadcast on television right so everybody gets to see all this stuff and half the 
[01:54:30]  stuff that happens is him embarrassing himself visually right so in this scenario he didn't realize he was on  the air and he's just sitting there in front of a tv camera not realizing he's on tv but there's more  of a visual we do a radio show it's too funny all right all right let's i don't think i've seen this  one look he's just on his computer so he's back at this point yeah he's on he's live on television  and radio but he don't give a fuck that's why i love mike francesa you don't have a clue he looks he 
[01:55:00]  he even looks at a computer and if you're in a bad way he's like huh huh if you criticize him for it  he'll say what do you want i've been doing this 25 years what do you want right right right he's still  it's just rejoiner music playing and playing and this is going out on the air on television  yeah why isn't he talking he has no idea he's on the air someone finally told him yeah  he's yana's producer like what i'm back why didn't you tell me nice if they tell me back 
[01:55:30]  i thought we usually go to commercial out of the uh update pete i mean come on since we play one  spot out of the commercial i mean come on pete oh wow man someone else what's going on ralph  hey afternoon uh mike that was it yeah he gets upset over his producers not telling him come on  what are you doing and the other great thing that you have to look for on youtube is when he yells at  his producers off mic because you can see him scowling and yelling yeah you can't hear it  this is the other one's a visual too but it's too funny it's too funny what is this one this one 
[01:56:00]  all right so what do you see in this photo he's on break yeah yeah that's his ice cream dish he's  got some ice cream right he loves treats while he does love treats there were teardrops hitting my  keyboard on my computer i was crying laughing so hard watching this why don't even tell us why then  okay all right all right and then we'll explain it to everyone because like you said it's visual  okay i want to know why you're laughing so hard at this you find the strangest things funny 
[01:56:30]  well the last one he's yelling at his producer there are times there's some solid  comedy going on in the studio and you're blank faced and then it's the dumbest stupidest thing  and you're laughing so hard you cry oh i love mike francis all right let's see  i totally get it when someone goes hey mike you're on the air you can't now 
[01:57:00]  cover up your ice cream everyone already saw it he took a little folded piece of paper and he's  trying very like stealthily to cover up the ice cream because he knows he knows that it'll just  lead to phone calls going hey mike you fat fuck you shouldn't be eating ice cream what do you like 
[01:57:30]  rocky road yeah yeah a pre-earning producer say mike mike you're on television what and he thinks he can  make it go he thinks he can make it go away by covering it up i have to cover my ice cream it's  the least natural thing it's obviously a piece of paper propped up in front of an ice cream  can you rewind that oh that's good you kind of like it right  you love it now i love how he thinks he can really make it just go away his face  his face gets a little panicky right like oh i think my ice cream's on camera and then he tries very 
[01:58:00]  stealthily to cover it up doesn't work to say he gets uh some ice cream every day  he loves that but this is the exact like example of this guy who will never admit when he's wrong  yeah and always has to be smarter than everybody else i wasn't eating ice cream right no no it wasn't  there you didn't see that let's see all right it's like he's ready to take a bite and you're like 
[01:58:30]  like you're on the air so it doesn't take the bite of that  i look at his face too he's like and you know what you know what the worst part is he really  wanted a spoonful oh boy but he stopped himself yeah throw to the graphics so he could eat his  ice cream yes yeah go to the grab for the graphics and you know the bites mike you agreed to be in a  radio studio with tv cameras just assume they're always on yeah yeah he uh that's funny that's it he 
[01:59:00]  wanted that ice cream yeah those are my best stuff that's great and then the new one of course and  then of course i watched all the classic ones that we've played all the prank calls of him getting uh  called out for sleeping and yeah him getting all upset so this is just a full of shit guy though  that's why he's hateable but you can't stop watching him and he's not hateable he does very  well man he's got his fans i'm not saying he i don't care if he's the fucking if he's the  fucking biggest thing in regular history i think he's hateable because he's a he's just a  fucking curmudgeon i think he's hateable but somehow he pulls her off is right i guess what 
[01:59:30]  i'm trying to say because he's got a pretty big fucking fan so did hitler i didn't enjoy watching  him either oh i enjoy watching i went with all these little fuck-ups and prank calls and now  and now the diet yeah hitler's greatest pranks spills his coke he blames a jew do you have dr rosenbaum in a  can and he gets so upset when people call him out like his go-to thing is like look i've been doing 
[02:00:00]  a radio i mean i've been doing a show 25 years five hours a day okay you you you come and you  and you bring up one minute one minute at a time wait it's not gonna affect me it's not gonna affect  me you think you're gonna affect me it's not gonna affect me and meanwhile it affects him so much  only affecting him it's it's the worst thing ever for him he told one guy he goes look look do me a  favor you see a book read it okay all right oh like that's his way of calling someone stupid  so this is the new clip okay i already am happy that's a three-quarters full thing of diet 
[02:00:30]  there's a lot of you haven't seen this yet no and by the way he loves diet coke always has a bottle of  diet coke next to him which is always bad for you at that point you might as well just drink the  fucking coke are they sponsors no no half the time the label is peeled off he just loves diet  coke and ice cream ice cream obviously i make an ice cream soda in my stomach what time do you think  he gets his ice cream every day well a show goes on at one he probably has he probably survives about 
[02:01:00]  two hours right around maybe a mid-show ice cream he gets by on diet coke from one to three and where  do you think he hides the ice cream every day oh it's right under his he's got a little fridge  under his console but he has a tiny little table that's just below the console yeah he's got a  little fridge under there and as soon as he sees that graphic goes up oh boy he's all in  he's all in now the fridge the compressor would turn on to make too much noise he's probably really  a hassle like an intern has to get a bowl and put ice in it and then he puts the ice cream in the  bowl of ice oh so he can hold it there for the whole show yeah make sure the ice cream's in the bowl 
[02:01:30]  of ice i don't get into it yeah i don't think he takes his time with ice cream no no way over  really quick it's it's nice and cold there's a fridge somewhere else it comes in and man he is  gobbling that like a shark fuck yeah he sees a graphic and then he goes at it how does he  fucking uh how does he do a radio show after eating ice cream i know how is he not clearing his  throat you don't give a shit he's been doing it 25 years 25 years 25 years that would kill me 25 years  i wonder if francesa could call in and tell us how he does this ice cream thing oh he would never 
[02:02:00]  you think when the engineers were building out of the studio he said uh look i need you to build  me an ice cream table i need a little ice cream table under the console i just i just i did 25  years i need a little my ice cream okay okay i can please that diet coke is taunting me oh you haven't  seen it no i have i have to see it do you think it's gonna stay up right oh no is there a lid on  there he makes he makes a rookie mistake with this it is a rookie mistake this is a rookie 
[02:02:30]  mistake what do you see precariously next to that bottle that would be his arm yeah hold on let's  make jimmy wait for a second because this guy actually pranked francesa last week uh matt and  queens we love you guys by the way good morning boys hey i listened to your first podcast i'm one of  the first guys on there when you did uh when you did them i tried getting them last week i called  him up i said uh we uh we adopted a golden retriever and we named it after you mike and uh  i fed it a gallon of diet coke and it died 
[02:03:00]  they cut off the diet coke part but he was all excited because he thought someone named the dog  ass people call up with the dumbest prank calls too i was watching one that had me rolling he was  talking about derek cheater being injured or something wait playing for us all right let me find it  this idea that i'm eating the gallon ice cream every day i don't know i i think he's eating ice  cream every single day oh hell yeah routine it's like it's a mid-show treat thank you matt all right 
[02:03:30]  this call had me die i could not just could not understand what i was laughing and i kept trying  to explain it to her through my tears through your tears and nothing interested in but i don't think  you're going to see at all i don't think you're going to see jorge behind a plate steven boundbrook  what's up steve mike how's it going man what's up hey uh regarding the jeter injury you've got to  get an mri you already had one yeah but mike listen what you've got to do get the mri whether 
[02:04:00]  he goes on a dl or not you got to give him some of your diet coke that's the ellipse you know what i'm  saying oh god no listen lose the number please why wouldn't you embrace that he said that's the  elixir right lose the number okay he said to one guy he started going he started going look if you  want to call you know we're paying the phone bill right if you want to call you want to call on your  dime it's your dime okay i'm not going to stop you but it's not going to affect me doesn't even cost  the dime no oh you got a calling plan free the level of his anger is what makes this so great and 
[02:04:30]  it's it's really becoming a huge thing that's mike francesa's stuff because he's on tv and you can  see him get so flustered and angry he's made it worse for himself dumb asshole look it's not gonna  affect me all right it's not gonna affect me and i don't think the tv dumps out like the radio show  obviously no no and so you can still get your pranks in the audio might dump out but you could still  see him get right right i'll just annoy to go for the button yeah yeah the yes network you can see 
[02:05:00]  him turn off his mic and yell at the producer okay because he also he's so full of himself i love it  he won't let his producers on the air right yeah but he'll talk to him so he'll have one-sided  conversations where you don't hear the other person no why would he wouldn't allow that person would  probably defend himself a little bit right he is defending himself but you can't hear him  does he have a talk ufc or is it just baseball football no god no no just yeah baseball football 
[02:05:30]  really not even a lot of hockey really all right let's uh here's finally the you ready  coke you're ready for this rookie mistake  we're gonna go around the league now  i can't go there anymore so i'm done you know that uh i cannot do it so go around  look at it it's all over it look over here yeah yeah all the way to the left does he even mention 
[02:06:00]  it look someone gave paper towels and he's like no that's all right he did he's good i smell some  soda both teams have some injuries look at how far it's running off to the left it doesn't have  injuries okay i mean everybody has okay but the jets with them he's peeling off paper towels when they go to  the graphic once again go to the graphic to cover it cover up fatso's fucking fatso's blunder his 
[02:06:30]  wrist gets it oh there it is he goes he goes oh i recovered i picked it up real quick and the soda  he picks up the soda and then kind of oh it just fountains over the top yeah it fits his up yeah and  fountains over the top for a good like 10 seconds because it's pretty new he just opened that bottle  let's watch it fall again you want to yeah yeah yeah i fell oh no people are having fun with this  clip oh it's one where it just goes over and over again and you know he's just when that happens to 
[02:07:00]  you like oh god what do i do it's getting all over his console oh yeah he's trying to be cool because  he's on television too but there's everything that happens to him on camera like that he must just  know like oh no the calls i'm gonna get prank calls now he's a bore instead of just saying like  i spilled soda like make it a whole thing of it yeah yeah he keeps with the boring stats  consummate professional jim that's people wouldn't post their the videos they post them because they 
[02:07:30]  see how annoyed he gets at everything somebody called up and asked him if he had seen the 1776  parody that we played right and he said i don't watch that i don't watch youtube so i haven't seen it  i don't know anything about it but the clip went viral of course you saw it but so why  can't he acknowledge that that guy did a good job goofing on him huh yeah just just it's almost  like an snl skit it's funny it was well done plus everybody's watching it so you could take a little  credit yeah but but can we hear a little the uh the 1776 i don't know you weren't here let me play this 
[02:08:00]  let's be honest the rebels probably have no chance to win but if the rebels have any chance  they better trust benedict arnold because when benedict arnold is benedict donald 
[02:08:30]  he's cornwallis and when cornwallis is cornwallis he's out there at the great okay so  if you're gonna trust anybody in this war on the rebel side benedict donald's your guy  back after this all right we're back and uh wrong about everything now listen i didn't want to get  into this but you know everybody's making a big deal out of it so i figured you know why you know  i wasn't ignoring it but you know uh people talking about it uh you know it's a good impression the other 
[02:09:00]  day oh that's the guy who calls us this idea that i don't like him i don't like him and i don't  support him but this idea that thomas jefferson is sleeping around or fooling around one of his  slaves i mean i know we are joined by uh commander and lord and general and all the titles uh you  want to give him because i mean he's great i mean he's one of the best uh lord cornwallis lord 
[02:09:30]  welcome how are you doing great michael how are you now you know listen i don't want to bother you  with this but you know we got to address it uh because you know people have to make a hubbub about  this and i know you're a decorated war hero and you know this is kind of a joke to you uh but do  these rebels do they worry you at all are you worried at all about you know george washington  any of these guys all right we're gonna go to henry there you go did a lot of people see that  yeah it's oh yeah close to 200 000 yeah made a whole bunch of sites a whole bunch of blogs 
[02:10:00]  what's going on with the the conan clip i don't know this one sam oh that was just conan  aired it and it was just really good they uh i guess mike myers is having a second kid  and the conan made a montage of all the local news reporters responding to it uh-huh wait till you  hear it yeah yeah you'll like it mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says 
[02:10:30]  yeah baby yeah baby come on really and i looked at it and they're all real like news stations yeah  they holy and they all think they're the only ones coming up with it that's what's  up about that and my favorite part after listening to it a couple times listen to it and you can hear  the people that are just reading the teleprompter and don't even understand the  you know the joker right right mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says  yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah 
[02:11:00]  baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike meyer says yeah baby mike  Myer says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby. Mike Myers says, yeah, baby 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, baby.  Mike Myers says, yeah, baby.  Did I say that right?  Yeah, I said it right.  Yeah, baby.  Holy shit.  Wow.  All different.  I just learned something today.  I thought the local news at least wrote their own stories.  There's a prep burger right there.  So there's got to be a service that says, okay, here. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God, a prep burger for the news.  It has to be.  There's no way all those stations would start exactly the same.  It's probably the way Clear Channel farms out the same bits to all their stations.  But if you're on ABC News or whatever, to all the affiliates.  Maybe entertainment stories.  So they don't even write their own shit.  I thought they at least wrote their shit.  Terrible.  Horrible.  Yeah, baby.  Does Mike Myers say, yeah, baby? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, baby.  That's funny.  I watched the first one there, International Man of Mystery, last night.  And?  Holds up.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's just fucking funny.  That goddamn movie's funny.  I've never seen it.  I've seen moments of it.  It was just fucking funny.  It's great.  What happened to him?  That was a tough drop off.  He just had a second kid.  You didn't hear?  He said, yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  You want to talk about a drop off, though?  Holy fuck.  Once he did that fucking love guru thing. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  Hard to come back from that.  The love guru.  He's allowed to have a bomb.  Like Sandler can have a bomb or two.  Oh, no.  Apparently, he's not allowed to have a bomb.  No, he hasn't been heard from in a while.  He might not want to be.  I want to be sick of time.  I think he wants to be making movies, to be honest with you.  What was his last big movie?  Well, of course, all the Shrek movies he did.  I mean, those are huge.  Right.  But he had a part in Inglourious Bastards, but that was just like a cameo. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  And that's it.  Aside from the Shrek movies, he was just a love guru.  So he hasn't really done anything unless he's done nothing since 2010.  And he had like the Austin Powers accent in Inglourious Bastards.  Yeah, a little bit.  Was he on camera?  Yeah, he was an English guy.  He was doing like a briefing in a conference room with some people.  Prep Burger for the news is the Associated Press.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so that was probably it.  Like entertainment news comes out and it says, Mike Myers says, yeah, baby, the headline. 
[02:14:00]  And then it's all those, you know, story.  And they're like, oh, that's so cute.  Let's use that.  No one else will.  I got to defend myself a little bit.  In radio, you get the AP wire.  Yeah.  And we all ripped.  We just rip it and read it.  But I thought locally on the news, because that's their thing, news, that they would  take that shit and maybe we rework it a little bit.  Don't just rip and read.  You can't just rip and read.  Yeah, right.  All horseshit.  Yeah, baby. 
[02:14:30]  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you.  Yeah, that was a funny fucking movie.  I say we take a break and maybe, is there a Jocktober today?  Oh, there is.  Oh.  A good one?  Yeah.  I'd be into it.  Are we going to be mad, excited, indifferent?  I think that you'll, definitely not indifferent.  Only a week.  I mean, this is over in what?  A week?  Two weeks.  Two weeks?  We got left?  This is the beginning of the second week.  I got you.  Okay.  You're going to enjoy it at first for the awfulness. 
[02:15:00]  Do not do War of the Roses.  And then you're going to get frustrated.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  You're going to enjoy it at first.  Oh, Jesus.  So enjoy that part.  When you feel like you're enjoying it, really enjoy it.  Because it's not going to last.  I think War of the Roses is a good bit.  It's like, I guess the...  Sirius, Sirius, X-Hands.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius X-Zone.  And now, I proudly present to you, to another Opie and Anthony Chokes radio. 
[02:15:30]  One girl used to like to like, she'd lick, this is true, she would lick my ass.  I would choke her while she'd lick my ass.  This is true.  Not hard.  She like, I would hold her neck while she, it was just a dominance thing.  It wasn't to her.  It was just hold her neck.  It wasn't really a lot of pressure.  This is the way he explains.  That's creepy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's that.  He gets the whole look and the...  Yeah, yeah.  And explains it like a serial killer confesses to all that. 
[02:16:00]  And then, no, I chopped her head off.  It's that Hannibal Lecter where your blood pressure doesn't go up.  Right, right.  His pulse doesn't go up at all.  He can just...  All right.  I'll do it.  I would straddle her face.  And I'd plop my asshole out of her mouth.  Now, I'd be facing down by her pussy and stuff.  All right.  You make a good point.  And I'd reach down and grab a little gal's neck and I'd rub my asshole on her mouth and 
[02:16:30]  I'd say, lick.  Lick.  And then I'd lean back and I'd say, open.  And her mouth would open.  And I would spit into her mouth.  Wow.  Or just on her face.  She liked that, too.  It was fucking hot, man.  Seriously, that was sexy.  That's some fucked up shit right there.  I would never want to do it to a girl who didn't like it.  No.  Like, if a girl doesn't like it, that wouldn't turn me on.  No.  It's, you know...  I like high energy Jimmy.  I gotta admit.  Yeah.  I did, too.  It was kind of fun.  And then, pal, I'd put it right in her shitter.  Back to you.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  See?  Told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to you.  The OPN Today Show.  I'm trying to figure out why the CCR.  That was earlier.  So what are you doing now?  Just a regular bed to bring you back.  Oh.  Why the CCR earlier?  Vietnam War protests in D.C.  Why didn't you tell us we were on? 
[02:17:30]  Okay.  Okay.  What do you mean Vietnam protest?  Which one?  The big one.  46 years ago.  46 years ago?  Yeah.  Vietnam was going on?  Sure.  Sure.  I love that.  Sure.  How about Thomas Edison invented a workable electric light 134 years ago?  That's amazing.  That's kind of impressive.  What happened?  What?  The black guy helped with the filament or something?  That's what I heard.  Yeah, maybe he did. 
[02:18:00]  Like, hey, here's a filament.  Here's your filament, Mr. Edison.  Thank you, sir.  Well, if you got an empty mint, you got to get something to fill it with right in.  That's funny.  Exactly.  Word play yeom with class.  See you.  I guess that...  They're trying to give credit to the fetcher?  Yeah.  You know.  Thomas Edison had some people, you know.  He had some people.  He had some peeps.  And he said, hey, I need one of those things in my shed.  Go get it for me.  Okay, Tom.  You got to call some people. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess that 12 years of slavery is big.  Big hit with black audiences.  It's a movie.  This guy, he was a free black man in New York.  And I guess something happens in the movie where he gets put down south and becomes a slave.  But he was a free man.  Is this a true story?  Played the violin and shit.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And then for 12 years, he's a slave.  Getting all whipped and shit like that. 
[02:19:00]  And all slave-y stuff.  And I was reading some comments last night from people that saw it.  A lot of black people.  And there was quite a few comments of, I want to punch white people in the face.  Oh, this movie is so moving and stuff.  I want to beat white people up.  I was like, what's the difference?  You're doing that anyway, from what I read in the paper.  A group of 10 youths, I guess.  In Brooklyn.  Yeah.  12 shots, 7 dead.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  We got shootings around New York City.  There was, I guess, a guy and his wife in a car.  Oh, that one is different.  I'm sorry.  You got 12 shots, 7 dead.  And then the other story is a group of 10 blacks attacked a white couple in their car in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  The guy was dumb, by the way.  He was very dumb.  He was dumb.  What an idiot.  What happened?  But you should be able to do stuff like that.  I guess the light turned green.  He was at a light.  And some youths were in front of his car.  And they weren't moving much like they do.  And he beeped his horn. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You don't want to rile him up like that.  They hear that sound.  I guess it's something in the culture that makes them beat and kick the car.  And then this idiot, this idiot, who's probably, you know, here's what he probably is.  He's probably a liberal dumb fuck that thinks he could step out of the car and reason with these animals.  So he gets out of the car to check the damage they did when they kicked his car.  And they beat the living piss out of him.  Stomp him. 
[02:20:30]  And then a 12-year-old girl grabs his wife by the hair and throws her down on the ground.  And it's just, the utter savage behavior is beyond me at this point.  It's infuriating.  It happens all the time.  It's just, it's too angering.  And the double standard, of course, is always there.  It's, you know, if a white person does anything bad to a black person, it's huge news.  The Daily News did cover it. 
[02:21:00]  They had to, and it's also selfish on their part because they wanted to cover it as a racial thing.  So if it's a racial thing, like a hate crime-y thing, they'll put the race in because that's the story.  You know, it's very odd how they cover these stories.  I was happy that they covered it.  That's all I asked.  I was, too.  Because if they just covered it fairly, I'm fine with that.  Yeah, I was happy that they actually said a group of 10 black youths.  Because there was a racial motivation to it.  Yes, they were screaming, get whitey, and beat that white bitch, and, you know, all the basic stuff. 
[02:21:30]  Just for honking a horn?  Yeah, just for honking a horn.  But that's nothing compared to the 250-person fight.  I love how they put that.  That, by the way, is a riot.  When 250 people are fighting, it's called a riot.  But they called it a fight, a 250-person fight in Jersey, at a bowling alley.  Apparently there was a big party, yeah.  A big bowling party.  And there's speculation by some of the people, because the guy that died was a good kid. 
[02:22:00]  Always good.  And they speculate he must have looked at someone wrong.  When you could sit there, and some guy gets stomped during a 250-person brawl, and you could legitimately look and not laugh,  that the reason could possibly be he looked at someone wrong.  It just harkens back to the animal planet, where a fucking leopard is looking at something else,  and he gives him an eye, and he attacks him. 
[02:22:30]  But I know what happened.  What?  He was hogging the Ms. Pac-Man machine.  Was that what happened?  And people were waiting.  That is a good game.  It's a fun game.  It's a great bowling alley game.  And then people started posting bowling for Behave.  I guess there was some kind of brawl at the bowling alley, and 250 people brawling.  I don't know where this many people come from.  I don't know how you could get 250 people to brawl at once.  Exactly.  I think that's almost impossible.  I didn't know black people bowled. 
[02:23:00]  I didn't know.  That was it, too.  That was it, too.  I didn't know that you get 250 black people bowling.  I think that was a white guy sport.  Oh, there was some horrific racist jokes about the bowling and the reason they were fighting.  I wish I could say it, but it's actually a takeoff of an old joke with bowling balls and black people.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  That's the one.  Of course.  Thought they were throwing him down the house.  Of course. 
[02:23:30]  Of course.  Too scared to say it, though.  Of course.  Oh, he just wrote it.  It's like, yep, that's the one.  Let me see it.  Of course.  That's the one.  That old gag.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there were a few racial incidents.  That one hit the mean streets of Centerport.  Oh, yeah.  The hallways of Harbourfields.  That was a good one.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  That's a hoot, Judge.  Well, you got a few stories here.  So, the ten blacks that beat up the white couple, did they arrest anybody?  Yeah, there were a couple of arrests. 
[02:24:00]  This one guy, of course, is saying it wasn't him.  He was just dressed like the people that were doing the assault.  So, he's saying, but he's out on $50,000 bond.  What's up with the couple?  They all right?  Yeah, the couple's all right.  They were hospitalized.  They went to the hospital.  They got patched up.  I guess the guy's got a fractured sternum.  Or a septum, not sternum.  Septum.  And a black eye.  And, you know, you're basic what you get when you're laying down in the fetal position, 
[02:24:30]  hoping for any type of mercy,  when these people continuously just kick you in the fucking head one after another.  What an idiot.  Your wife's in there.  You're putting her in danger, you dumb cunt.  What a dumb guy.  You don't get out of the car.  You lock your fucking doors.  And you run someone over if you have to.  Right, just like that guy did with the motorcycles.  You don't fucking get out of the car.  You lock your doors.  You don't worry about offending somebody. 
[02:25:00]  You don't guilt yourself into not locking the doors or not thinking you should just take off.  Because that's going to keep you alive.  I don't know why people's survival instincts go down the shitter when they feel they have to be politically correct and put that over their own safety.  I don't understand the people that will walk, even though it's a green light, right in front of your car.  They just assume that you see them.  That's the craziest part about that.  There are some people.  Basically, if you see, you're going to stop because you don't want to deal with that shit.  But what about the people that aren't looking as you're making that move? 
[02:25:30]  There are some people that just walk out.  It's unbelievable.  Because they're stupid.  And then there's other people.  No, they just assume everyone's going to stop.  But what about the one person trying to find a song on the radio or they're texting?  Oh, yeah, they're stupid.  They're just crazy to just assume we're going to stop.  But then there's another type of person that just walks very slowly, on purpose.  I guess it's a cultural thing.  I don't know.  You know what I do with those people?  I let them take their sweet time because I learned my lesson.  Yeah, that's true.  The famous fucking time me and Ant had a problem that could have been way worse. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, boy.  Thank God it was Midtown Manhattan that that happened.  Yeah.  Plenty of white people around who were in deep shit.  And that was before, you know.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Talking about the incident where the guy, we don't have to redo the whole story, but  the guy took out my side view mirror with one fucking punch because I might have tapped  into him.  Because I didn't want him to, I couldn't wait for him anymore.  Come on, move.  We wanted to get home.  They do that, though.  You know, it's also great when you see people step off the sidewalk into the crosswalk 
[02:26:30]  because somebody else did.  And they're not even looking at traffic.  They just follow the leader kind of a thing.  And almost gets crushed.  And I've been driving and I'm looking and I see somebody.  I've got to get off.  And I know they can make it.  Well, and they also are aware of what's going on.  Right.  But the other person's not aware and just goes, oh, this guy's going, I'm going.  Steps right off.  I will, I lay on the horn from half a block away.  And you see him jump in the air.  I love watching him jump back.  And they get all mad at you. 
[02:27:00]  Or if you have to make a right or a left turn and there's traffic, but you could get around  to the right or the left to make the turn, it's clear.  But there's people standing in the crosswalk off the curb in what is, in essence, your lane.  Right.  You can't make that sharp right turn.  Bip!  Get the fuck out of the road, you cocksucker!  Do they move?  Oh, yeah.  And then they flip you the bird like they're mad.  And I stop and I turn around and look out the window.  I go, you're in the road!  Jesus Christ. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, I love yelling at people.  What the fuck?  Do we have Jocktober?  Yeah.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-F-G.  Host. 
[02:28:00]  Host.  Bits.  And stunt boys.  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  I think we're revisiting a show, right?  What?  We have done this in years past.  Okay.  I remember this guy's name because we know the other Kane.  Oh, right.  This is not that Kane.  There's another Kane out there.  This is not the K-Rock Kane who used to work here, too.  I don't know. 
[02:28:30]  Speaking of radio and Washington, we're going down to Washington, D.C.  WJFK.  Oh.  We used to work for them.  Yes.  And WPGC in Washington refused to run ads calling for Redskins name change.  Oh, yeah?  I like that.  Do you?  Yeah.  Huh?  Do you?  Why not?  They won't take the ad money.  They fucking sell beer.  They don't mind taking an ad for beer.  Well, people fucking beat their kids.  Every single time.  But, I mean, it's like, even if they don't agree with it, they're not going to take the 
[02:29:00]  ad money?  Yeah.  Not taking the ad money.  Good.  Stop.  Then stop taking fucking beer ads until drunk driving gets stopped.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop that.  You know?  You might not like this, but how about you don't take the fucking ad money for that  type of stuff?  Wow.  Damn.  Didn't look at it that way.  I just thought it was cool that someone was finally standing up to some shit out there.  You never hear anyone standing up for any type of shit.  Dude, if the NFL literally showed balls with political correctness, I swear to you, I'd 
[02:29:30]  be 100% behind the Redskins.  I'm just so fucking...  The way they groveled...  Rush Limbaugh said a black quarterback, and they fucking...  I know that that's not the Redskins.  That's the end.  But it's still that whole culture of fucking sucking every special interest cock.  They can't get enough special interest cock in their fucking mouth.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  He said fag.  We're sorry.  He said black quarterback.  Boo.  All the NFL owners.  Boo.  Boo.  These cocksuckers can't take special interest dick fast enough. 
[02:30:00]  No.  Fuck them.  Now this one is going to hurt financially.  So they're like, ah, fuck you.  All those years, you fucking...  You didn't stand up.  Now you want to...  Fuck them.  We just don't want them coming after us.  I believe that.  That's why we got to defend a lot of this shit.  And they'll never defend us.  I'm tired of defending people.  I know they're not going to defend us.  Of course not.  No one ever sticks up for fucking radio guys or comics.  Of course not.  We're the dummies.  We're always out there defending them.  And then shit happens to us and nobody says a fucking word.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry.  Mm-hmm.  It annoys me.  No one ever comes to the fucking radio show. 
[02:30:30]  I agree.  Bat.  I fucked that up.  Radio shows bat.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  No one ever comes to bat for radio shows.  I got an hour.  I got an hour.  No one ever comes to radio shows bat.  I love it.  I like it better your way.  I'm tired.  Sleepy, Jimmy.  Yes, I am.  All right.  Jock-tober for today.  Hot 99.5 in Washington, D.C.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The Kane Show.  I do remember we did these guys in the past.  Are they good?  I don't remember. 
[02:31:00]  I couldn't tell you.  Not bad.  Not a bad show.  What do we got with the Kane Show again, quickly?  Well, the Kane Show, it's a whole group of them.  Oh.  There's two girls and two guys, but Kane is the leader.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  There's Kane and Eric.  I mean, well, there's also, there's Intern John, who's like, he's not actually an intern,  but they just call him Intern John.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  Oh, that's funny.  And then there's the two girls.  They're kind of there like Kane.  He's a little nuts, but not too bad. 
[02:31:30]  Like, he knows when to keep it in check.  Intern John and Eric, sometimes they get a little carried away with stuff.  But do we have to worry?  Luckily.  Ah.  We got a couple of lovely ladies to kind of calm things down a little bit.  Yeah.  Whoa.  All right.  It's an unusual combination of people, though.  Well, it's a big show.  It's the Kane Show.  Sounds like a morning zoo type of thing.  A little bit.  All right.  We got Eric.  Eric, uh, could you go back to that picture for a second?  All right. 
[02:32:00]  Uh, you got Eric.  Uh, he brought in some clothes for John, who's what, the intern guy, but he's not an intern?  Right.  And the ladies chime in.  Eric comes in, he's talking about, yo, man, I got some clothes that I'd like to, that don't  fit me, but I think would go great with John.  Yeah.  And he's talking about whether or not it would be creepy to donate clothes to a co-worker  that you, that you think he would look good in.  Not that John wants, but that you think he would look great in.  It's a button-down or whatever.  It's like a skater shirt.  That's not weird.  No, I also have a couple other button-down shirts that I don't wear anymore that I figured 
[02:32:30]  would help spruce up his array of plaid shirts.  Yeah, because Eric is the pinnacle of fashion on this show, Mr. Hoodies and cartoon t-shirts.  Eric wears nice shirts.  He does wear that.  Eric wears nice shirts.  I literally tapped out.  I know.  That person was gone.  We give, we bring in our clothes and give it to the staff.  What's this we shit?  Me and Jimmy. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Two out of three.  Okay.  Two out of three.  I gotta be honest.  I think it's, if we're gonna go off on the Jocktober guys, do it.  I think it's creepy.  What?  To give other guys...  Giving your other male co-workers your old clothes.  Not when you work with millionaires.  It's not creepy.  I don't know.  It's creepy.  I know that I stopped doing it because I think I did find it a little weird.  Yeah.  But I mean, these guys weren't making a lot of money and, you know, the opester might have  put on a few pounds. 
[02:33:30]  That was my point.  But he's losing the baby weight finally.  Finally.  Getting there.  Yeah.  Opie comes in with $100 baby jeans that'll fit me and I don't have a problem with that.  Oh.  I used to.  Yeah.  Then it's like your fucking dick is touching where his dick was and his ass was.  It's not washed.  It's not washed.  There's nothing there.  It's just the prince.  You fucking girl, you're putting it where the dick was directly.  You eat pussy, don't you? 
[02:34:00]  Clothes are kind of a personal thing.  I don't know.  I think the staff would appreciate an Anthony Cummion.  Oh, please.  They ain't getting the shit out of me.  Unless anybody's going away on fucking military maneuvers.  Right.  We already got all the Rockstar t-shirts.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yes, I'm wearing them.  More on the clothes thing.  Thank God.  Thank God.  So far, they're getting some good stuff done here.  Yeah.  They're my shirts.  That's nice.  John is stuck in cargos and plaids.  He can use some help.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine you having to do radio with chicks?  Uh-uh.  That fucking voice.  You don't think that's a conversation jumper offer?  Holy fuck.  John is stuck in cargos and plaids.  He can use some help.  Yeah.  He's in a rut.  He's in a plaid rut.  He has DNA on those shirts that I don't want to know about.  Can I ask you a question?  Yes.  What's the concern, then, with you and offering the shirts to John?  Does it just seem a little weird or, like, cheesy that I'm giving another guy some shirts? 
[02:35:00]  No, it's good.  I hate, bro.  I had this in my closet and thought of you.  I couldn't agree with John more.  It's definitely what it is.  I saw the shirt, and I was like, I actually would love this shirt.  I don't mind it.  Grow up.  I mean, it's not great, but it's just there.  I'm not in it.  It's not inspiring me.  No.  No.  No.  It's just for sure.  John goes one step too far, but they're still talking about this.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're not quite done.  Holy fuck.  Eric is so sweet.  He needs more credit.  Text right after that.  No way. 
[02:35:30]  Didn't you hear Eric doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom?  Ew.  Thanks for girls' part.  I wash my clothes.  Will they help me see a vagina impersonator?  Oh, my gosh.  Please stop.  Do you know how time it is?  John, John, John, just for a second.  There are kids listening to this show right now.  I don't know what that is.  Oh, God.  Washing the hands.  That was a man?  Yeah.  You're still impartial?  No.  That kind of stuck.  That was a man.  Yeah.  But washing the hands after the bathroom is so overrated. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  When I leave my house, my dick is the cleanest part on my entire body.  That's no.  Then why don't you wash your dick after you touch it?  I agree.  The dick is clean.  I don't wash my hands a lot of times.  I never wash my fucking hands after I piss.  After I shit, I will.  What about all that?  But the piss could get on your hand.  Yours gets splashed.  But it does.  If you get splashed back from the urinal.  Then I go like this because it's my pee.  I don't give a fuck.  I wipe it on my pants and I move on.  But then if you got to touch something other people.  Oh, shit.  We're doing the break.  Swim wall.  Touch things that other people are touching or shake hands with someone. 
[02:36:30]  But washing hands after you pee is so stupid.  You should be washing your dick because that's getting more.  But you're not touching anybody with your dick until, you know.  What's getting dirtier?  Your dick or your hands?  Well, it could be your dick.  No, your hands have already touched so much shit before it touches your dick for the first time.  Absolutely.  So technically, we all should be whipping out our dicks and washing them in the sink.  No, but no one else is touching your dick during the day.  Or you're not opening doorknobs with your dick.  Or you're not fucking, you know. 
[02:37:00]  Touching your face.  Chicken hands with the dick.  So you keep your dick nice and dirty?  No, the dick is clean.  So we're cleaning our hands for urine?  Because you care about other human beings?  You?  Well, no.  But I'm also eating something here.  You put it going and touching your face.  But once again, your dick is so clean.  It doesn't matter if you go and eat your eggs right after you.  Piss or fucking fecal matter on your dick.  Fecal matter on your dick?  Fecal matter.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right. 
[02:37:30]  Let's go with that for a while.  I gotta go.  You gotta wash my hands.  All I'm saying is technically we should be washing your dicks after we take a piss.  Because that's getting way dirtier than your hands.  Went on a date with some chick once and went to the fucking bathroom.  And there's the guy that's one of the fucking chefs.  And he takes a fucking piss.  And then he just kind of straightens his hair in the mirror.  And walks out.  And I got a fucking...  And then he went and made like this pizza or something. 
[02:38:00]  And I see him back there.  I didn't know he's...  I saw him making pizza.  It's one of those kitchens that are...  The dining room kitchen with the glass thing.  And he's making the pizza.  And you saw that guy in the bathroom.  And the fucking girl I'm with orders the pizza.  And I saw the fucking guy not wash his goddamn hands.  And I wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't fucking eat it.  I'm fine with it.  She's like, try it.  I'm like, I just shook my head.  I'm like, nah.  And I'm like, I'm not hungry.  What's a pizza oven?  Like 400 degrees?  Yeah.  Alright.  That is gross.  You're good.  It's disgusting.  You're good.  No.  You're good.  No. 
[02:38:30]  If he was making sushi or something, he didn't have a problem with it.  Nope.  I'm with Anna on that.  Not eat it.  I mean, I wouldn't touch it if it's...  I'm with you on not washing my hands.  But I'm with you on the fucking...  If touching the food is a little...  Oh, I'm going to make you a great...  You should just not go to a restaurant.  Something a special...  And it said, you know, wash hands right in the bathroom.  No.  That's disgusting.  Yeah.  Alright.  Well, I want to thank the Kane Show for giving us material today.  There you go.  Thanks.  Another reason why we do Jocktober.  That is true. 
[02:39:00]  Every so often, Jocktober spills into, hey, it gave us an idea.  We just had some inspiration there.  Good.  Five minutes of terrific material.  Right.  It's phone topic time.  We love phone topics.  The good hygiene is very important.  We're done with that.  We enjoy a good phone topic.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't done one in a while.  Nope.  They did one.  I wanted to bring this up, too, because lately there have been some...  And I would never do anything on the low like this, but I do find it interesting when 
[02:39:30]  people offer up solutions.  I don't want to say bribe.  Fuck!  Huh?  Damn.  No.  Fuck!  What?  You son of a bitch.  You got us again.  What?  You didn't know?  No, I didn't know!  Seinfeld.  Oh, you guys.  What a dick!  That was Poppy.  You're getting way better.  See, Jerry went into the bathroom and Poppy came in and goes, Jerry, I'm going to make 
[02:40:00]  you something very special.  And he came out of a dumper.  And Jerry's washing his hands.  And they did it so well, because you know he took a shit or something in there.  And he just looks in the mirror, adjusts his collar, runs his hands through his hair, and  then walks out.  And Jerry's horrified.  He's horrified.  You're getting way better at this, man.  Wow, I didn't know that.  Poppy's getting a little sloppy.  Poppy's a little sloppy. 
[02:40:30]  How did you...  My batting average is going way down.  How did you get it?  Give Josh like a few seconds.  Oh, okay.  Josh in Boston.  Go ahead, buddy.  I'm a huge Sonny Bell fan.  I got it right away.  Right when he said running the hand through the hair.  The way he runs his hands through his hair.  It's perfect, because they had to let the people know that the reason Jerry's horrified  is he's not washing his hands.  So if he just...  Huh?  Yeah, that's the Poppy one.  Yeah.  Was that the one where he wouldn't eat the pie either? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The girl wouldn't eat the apple pie at the beginning.  That's right.  And then Jerry did the same thing with Poppy's pizza.  But they did...  It's such a great writing way to convey that he didn't wash his hands.  He does all this, like, other shit in front of the mirror, and Jerry's just fucking horrified.  It was really well done.  Yeah.  I watched it every night.  I did it right away.  Right when you started.  Did Jerry say, hey, you got pecker juice on your hands?  That would have been good.  That would have been good. 
[02:41:30]  You should have written for that show, Chipper.  I did.  Oh, that's right.  Of course you did.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  You know, I was doing night radio, and I think I've told you this before.  I never saw Seinfeld when it was on.  Me neither.  You know what episodes I've seen?  I didn't watch it when it was on, really.  You know, in syndication, obviously.  Yeah.  And I never saw it when it was actually on, because I was doing radio.  I saw a few episodes when it was actually on, but no, it was until after it was done. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, really?  You weren't a big fan when it was on TV?  No.  Oddly enough, no, I wasn't.  Why?  I don't know.  I just never watched it enough.  It seems like something you would have liked.  I know.  I just never watched it enough.  And then once...  I watched some of the last season, and then, of course, the final episode, and then when  it went into syndication.  That's when you became a huge fan.  That's fucking just...  Yeah.  Wow.  Gotta watch it.  Well, bravo.  You got us again.  Oh, damn.  I was hoping I would just leave it there, and later on, on Twitter, I'd be like, read  Hopi, you motherfucker.  I did that to you last week. 
[02:42:30]  It's hilarious.  All right.  Back to this dumb phone topic.  For up solutions.  I don't want to say bribes, because...  They are bribes.  Yeah, but it's never been presented like that.  It's never been...  It's never been, yo, you give me jingle ball tickets for my kids, and I'll give you a...  Like, it's never been like that.  But bribes are never usually just called what they are.  You know what I mean?  Everyone always says it stealthily.  I have a...  We have a friend that works with us. 
[02:43:00]  I don't want to give away too much information.  But a parent offered to send all of us to karate classes, and what to get...  I get to get a certain belt.  It would take more than a year.  He's offered to speed up the process and make it six months.  Yeah.  That's cool.  For jingle ball tickets.  And I politely said no thank you.  For a lifetime of skills.  You better offer something better than karate classes for me.  Well, no, but that's what I wanted to do.  No one has gone, yo, five grand for jingle ball.  It's never been like that, and I would never in a million years do it, A, because it's illegal, 
[02:43:30]  B, because I don't think it's right.  But I got to tell you, I'm wondering who's got an unconventional bribe in either in their office or in a hobby at some point in their life.  What?  I don't know what this is.  What happened?  He's trying to figure out.  He refused a weird bribe, and he's trying to figure out if people in the audience have gotten a weird bribe.  There you go.  What was the weird bribe he refused?  The karate thing?  Somebody offered him karate for jingle ball shit.  Shit.  And they would give him a belt faster. 
[02:44:00]  This just seems like a break.  Right.  Yeah, like, okay.  Like, not worth talking about, even.  Well.  An incredibly boring call from a college teacher.  Yeah, like, you know how you're doing a topic on bets, or not, bribes?  Yeah.  And you think, oh, a young female college professor calls in.  Oh.  Oh, I wonder what this bribe was on.  I bet it was sexy.  Um, Melissa, you're a university instructor, is that right?  That's right. 
[02:44:30]  So, if you gave somebody an increase in a grade, what would they give you as an unconventional bribe?  They were offering to give me a deal on eyeglasses at a store they work at.  Ooh, now glasses can be very expensive, though.  Yes, they can.  They can.  But I said no way.  Oh, good for you.  Um, how much do they, what do they want?  Like, they go from a deep?  This is like watching your toast cook.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were sitting there just waiting.  Yeah.  They were offering to give me a clit piercing. 
[02:45:00]  Exactly.  I took them from an F to a D minus.  Just because you get a phone call on the topic doesn't mean you put it on the air.  Yeah.  And that's the best you got?  No, I cut out the very worst ones.  Oh, wow.  The worst, worst ones?  Yeah, those are the ones we should listen to.  Dude, I couldn't even sit there listening to it.  What do they want?  Like, they go from a D to a C, or what?  It was just an increase in the grade.  It probably wasn't anything significant, but I don't remember offhand, but there's no  way I can do that.  I was going to say, I'm surprised, because that, once again, it'd probably be your job. 
[02:45:30]  I got a weird bribe one time.  Did you?  No.  Craig?  I did.  Oh, what?  Whoops.  Somebody wanted to try my fedora.  I said, did you just give me some beer mashed potatoes?  I'll let you try my fedora.  It's not a bribe.  I'm not even going to acknowledge this character.  I'm just not.  Why, he wanted to try my fedora if I could get the taste of his potatoes.  It's not a bribe.  Terrible character. 
[02:46:00]  We got a phone call from a Hooters waitress.  Oh.  Sophia.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Kane Show.  Are you, you're a manager at Hooters?  No, no, I used to be.  Oh, yes.  So, so, there's one weekend every year where possibly up to $1,500 in two days, three days  of working.  What weekend?  Wait, what weekend is that?  It was like a big biker weekend.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So, one father who didn't have the strongest server for a daughter offered me a brand new 
[02:46:30]  transmission if I got his daughter on the main section of the restaurant.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Hey, listen, if you put my pretty daughter in the busiest section.  Well, he wasn't that pretty.  Oh, yeah.  He was pimping on his daughter.  Oh, that's terrible.  She did the 40-yard dash in a 30-yard room.  No.  No, I didn't do it.  Obviously.  Obviously, I didn't do it.  Yeah, but did you save the...  He hated me. 
[02:47:00]  I'm sure.  Did you save his card at least in the future if you ever needed a new transmission?  Absolutely not.  Yeah, my transmission would have probably fallen out if I would have went to him outside.  There you go.  Oh, my gosh.  Sophia, I love it.  We didn't listen to any of that clip.  That probably wasn't worth listening to.  No, we were just enjoying Anthony's line for the last minute.  I have no idea what that film calls about.  It wasn't a sexy story.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I couldn't tell you.  I know there was a Hooters waitress, and he made a hack joke about running the 40-yard dash in a 30-yard room. 
[02:47:30]  Well, a Hooters waitress calls up to say, I was...  No, I don't need to know.  All right.  I really don't need to know.  That's probably the right choice.  I don't...  I'm totally like, blah, about this show.  It just sits there, doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Time for the loser line.  All right, good.  Is this like the FU line?  Marquee bits.  Well, this is great because...  I like a marquee bit.  Yeah.  What they do is...  Marquee bit.  The one of the... 
[02:48:00]  I guess intern John gave his phone number out to the audience, his old phone number.  Uh-oh.  And then people...  Fuck, we did that.  Yeah, really.  But they left it on.  Holy...  That's another one.  So now...  This is...  Oh, my God.  Wait till you hear this.  No, this is...  This is a bit...  Hundreds of radio stations are doing.  Yeah.  No.  Girls can take the number...  Yeah.  ...and give it to guys at a bar...  Oh.  And then they call up leaving a voicemail for what they think is the girl, and then without 
[02:48:30]  permission or consent...  You play it.  You play the real voicemails that people left.  This is so fake.  This is another fake bit.  It's been done a few different ways, but okay, fine.  They're doing it that way.  Hey, girls, here's a phone number.  When you're out there and some guy is hitting on you, give him this number.  And then we'll take his messages and illegally play him.  Which used to be a real bit that one guy did.  I forgot who exactly.  I think they all started with the same...  With, like, an idea that they were real.  Right.  And now it's not real, because you can't do this. 
[02:49:00]  You can't just, like, put someone's voice on the air like that.  Plus, just fake it.  Plus, they ran out of ideas.  They're like, well, what if we do this every single day?  Ah.  You do it every day.  Loser line, I believe so.  At least every three days, a couple times a week, sure.  This is an extremely hack bit.  Oh, yeah.  So we're about to hear, what, guys leaving messages for what they thought was a girl?  Oh, yeah.  They gave them a number at a bar somewhere?  Oh, yeah.  I bet they're not just like, hey, hi, it's Bill.  I met you the other day. 
[02:49:30]  Love to get together.  Here's my number.  Hey, thanks.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Right.  Click.  None like that, right?  No, well, it's the loser line.  Oh, right.  They have to be losers.  I wonder if this is a syndicated bet, too.  I would imagine.  Where they do it all for you and just send it to the station.  Yeah.  Or they get the same actors who do the War of the Roses calls.  Whatever.  Who do you want to start with, John?  Let's start with Aaron.  Here you go.  Loser line number one. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, Monica.  It's Aaron, your favorite student from your spin class on Mondays.  Listen, I'm just calling and say hi, see how things are going.  And also, I've been experiencing a bit of tightness.  I was wondering if there's...  Dude, we're at the point where this is not fun.  It's infuriating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your favorite spin class.  So she tricks this guy, and then she still has to go to spin class. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  Like, even their setup is horrible.  He's paying her for this, but she's the instructor, supposedly.  Oh, boy.  You're on the loser.  But he doesn't have the instructor's number?  No, he doesn't have her phone number.  He's not going to go to spin class next week and say, hey, I left you a voicemail.  Why was it on the radio?  Anyway, here's the money for the spin class.  Of course.  I want to hear about some tightness in his pants, I bet.  I was saying a bit tightness, and I was wondering if there's anything you would suggest for that.  And also, maybe you want to go for a ride sometime with me outside of class. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, my gosh.  That would be great, you know.  Some of the bikes can go.  Yeah.  End of message.  To delete this message.  Dude, this is very awkward, too, for the rest of the time he's in that class.  You don't think it's real?  No.  Oh, not at all.  Not even close to real.  Not even like a little?  No.  You can't even set it up properly.  Not even based on a true story?  The scenario doesn't make sense.  It doesn't at all, does it?  Maybe if you keep it in a bar.  You can't know that person. 
[02:51:30]  No, you can't know the person.  If there was a chance meeting, then at least that scenario is believable.  Not someone you see every Monday in spin class.  He says it's your favorite student.  That would mean they've had interactions before.  Uh-huh.  Who's Brian?  Brian is, I think he was on a college campus trying to get you to sign up to vote.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  Hello?  Hey, Barbara.  It's Brian.  How are you?  I met you today in the comments, and I'm really hoping I can get you to come out and vote. 
[02:52:00]  If you want to get together and talk some politics, give me a call.  Here's my number.  End of message.  To delete this message, press 7.  Then he calls back.  Message deleted.  End of new message.  Here's message number two from Brian.  Next message.  Hey, Barbara.  It's Brian again.  Haven't heard from you in a couple of days.  Listen.  Really, I don't give a s*** about politics.  I just wanted to meet some young ladies and was hoping that we could get together, go out, party. 
[02:52:30]  Have a good time.  Give me a call.  What?  What?  Get me real.  Give me a call.  Give me a call.  Give me a call.  Give me a call.  Give me a call.  What?  What do you call it's fake?  You don't think there's anything to be quite that excited about?  They even know it's fake.  You can hear them trying to like, no, this isn't fake.  This isn't fake.  They try to pump it up.  Yeah.  Like laughter and everything else.  And the spin class thing.  At the end of it, they're like, oh, it's going to be pretty awkward for him when he goes 
[02:53:00]  back to that class.  Right.  Because it's real.  It's real.  Trust us.  It's real.  It's real.  I guess the hilarity continues here.  Oh, yeah.  Who's Derek?  Derek is trying to pick up a girl with a girlfriend.  I'm not talking.  Hey, Ali.  Or the boyfriend, rather.  Derek.  Just thought I'd give you a call.  I hope you enjoyed that chai tea latte that I bought you the other day.  Oh, boy.  I know that you have a boyfriend, but I don't know.  It doesn't seem like we still can't be friends or whatever. 
[02:53:30]  So we're having a big party tonight at my place.  But the thing is, we're kind of over capacity.  So we actually could probably only squeeze in one more.  So let me know if you're down for it.  It'd be great to see you.  Oh, that's terrible.  All right.  Talk to you soon.  Bye.  Oh, that's terrible.  Slick try, though.  Yeah, you can't get your boyfriend because we only have room for one more capacity.  No one.  All mixed terror.  And then they all start just babbling really fast.  Yeah.  Well, they don't want anybody to sit there and think about it.  Like, analyze what they just heard.  Oh, he's really trying to get her to come without her boyfriend by saying there's only 
[02:54:00]  room for one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  That works, right?  No.  I can see him brainstorming these ideas.  So what about a guy that, it's a girl with a boyfriend, but he doesn't want the boyfriend  coming.  What can we do?  Let's say we're having a party.  It's all full.  All full.  There's no party that's ever all full.  They're brainstorming sessions.  Shut the fuck up, you stupid.  Have you ever been to a party where it's all full? 
[02:54:30]  It's all full up.  Shut the fuck up.  We can only fit one more person.  What a dumb concept.  We're at capacity for this house party.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We don't want to break the law.  A lemon party once I went to, and I was not allowed to participate.  Only three allowed.  I think we should cut it there.  It's not really working today.  I don't know, because there is other stuff.  Just because there's other stuff on the disc.  I don't know if you saw all the...  I think we should cut our losses.  I don't think October's working today.  Just because there's so many other tracks that you haven't gotten to is the only thing.  I'm 99.5 in Washington, D.C. 
[02:55:00]  The Kane Show.  Right.  You know, I mean, there's just other tracks.  And also, I don't know if you guys remember, but this is the show that was referenced by  a caller last Thursday.  Oh!  Who is a voice actor.  Right.  Did I forget to mention that?  Right, right.  Okay.  I see the tie-in now.  Because I saw this, and I really did get very mad.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  So we had an actor.  Maybe we'll hear him.  I can't tell if it's him.  It could be him. 
[02:55:30]  Could be.  But this guy last week admitted that he acts on those War of the Roses calls.  That he, and he does it for the...  Proving that they're all fake.  And bullshit.  Yeah.  And a lot of fucking shows are doing that.  He called from D.C. to say, I do them for the Kane Show at least once or twice a week.  Yes.  Yes, we did hear him say that.  This show that we're listening to?  Yeah.  Is the Kane Show.  So it's got to drop a piece of gum.  Here we go to Roses!  Roses are red.  Pilots are blue.  Yeah, yeah.  When Kane calls your man. 
[02:56:00]  He'd better choose you.  Kane, your husband Robin, you guys have been married for three years?  Yeah.  And this started with a birthday in...  July.  July.  July, yeah.  Okay, so he's a sports fan.  What did you do?  Well, I got him this awesome...  Write your own shit!  That's all we ask!  You know, this is a...  These guys, I'm telling you, they have to know this is a hack bit.  Write your own shit!  Of course they do.  Come up with your own fucking concepts!  This is great.  Maybe this one's real. 
[02:56:30]  If they suck, they suck, then you spin it on the air.  Maybe it's real, this one.  Maybe this is the one that, you know...  What did you do?  Well, I got him this awesome take, you know, made personally for him, with his favorite sports  team on it, and he loved it, which was great.  And he wanted more information about the bakery that did that.  He was like, oh, this will be awesome.  By the way, a lot of people, and we should have mentioned that last hacky bit, why aren't  any of the guys leaving their phone numbers?  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  They didn't exchange numbers.  The bit is, she gave her number, technically.  Uh-huh.  So why wouldn't they go, hey, man, you gave me the number, it's been class, it's blah,  blah, here's my number if you want to call me back?  Or just text her.  How about you give me a jingle?  That's what I always say.  Right.  Yeah.  Give us a jingle back.  Yeah, there would be texting going on.  No one makes those type of phone calls anymore.  No, no.  That's so, what we just heard, yeah, we should mention that, too.  It's so archaic.  Yeah, because who actually used their phone?  It's the easier way to do it.  To call somebody.  You don't call someone. 
[02:57:30]  No.  And even the small percentage of people that do call someone, even that, they don't  leave voicemails.  No.  Like, the percentage of people who leave voicemails is, hey, just called you, uh, you  know, your text.  Right.  Just called you.  Hmm, not there.  He wanted, and he loved it, which was great.  And he wanted more information about the bakery that did that, because he wanted more information  and he was like, oh, this will be awesome for, like, clients and, you know, work-related  things for other people.  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, I gave them the information of the bakery and who made that cake and all 
[02:58:00]  that fun stuff.  They're very wordy on this show.  They did just everything.  Very wordy.  Forever.  Forever.  Well, I don't know the setup.  Because you forget, because it's been so many words.  What happened?  It's a bakery.  Well, it's a bakery.  What about the bakery?  She got a nice cake.  She got a birthday cake for her hubby.  And then the husband's asking questions about the bakery.  The husband said, hey, I could use that bakery contact.  Could you give me the number for the bakery?  The scenario is already starting to be like, what?  It just sounds ridiculous.  And then her what?  Suspicion, oh, there's a cute girl that works there. 
[02:58:30]  Why wouldn't he just go to the bakery?  Because it would be better to ask your wife for the thing.  Yeah, yeah, ask your wife for the number of the fucking place that the girl's at that  you want to cheat.  This show is extra bad because they're doing the hack bits, but then they can't even set  them up where they're believable, even.  Or almost believable.  How would you know that the cute girl works at the bakery if you haven't even been there yet?  I know.  You got a cake, and you look at the cake and go, oh, wow, I bet a hot girl made this  cake.  Enough about the cake.  What'd she do?  Fucking put an imprint of her vag on top? 
[02:59:00]  That looks nice and meaty.  I like a fruitcake.  Ah, right.  You know, work-related things for other people, so, you know, I gave them the information  of the bakery and who made that cake and all that fun stuff.  Was it like one of those, like, designer, like one of those, you know, fancy designer  cakes?  Yeah, yeah.  Not a sheet cake with carrots.  What difference does it make?  It tastes good, it looks good.  You know, it's all around good.  So you gave him the information to the woman that made it. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, my God!  Wow.  Okay, where do you-  Have confidence in what you're saying on the air that someone is listening.  This just goes on and on.  Is this still the setup?  Yes, you reset up every sentence over and over.  How did this all start going south for you?  Um, it was after that I got a traffic light ticket that was from his car, and not only was  he not even in the car, but this woman was driving his car. 
[03:00:00]  So there's footage, like, on a video of her driving my husband's car.  And it was just bizarre.  Like, I didn't know what to think.  Because, you know, what-  What the f-  This is-  By the way, the big bitch on CNN, her nipples are popping out.  Nice.  What the fuck?  That's what I was pointing out before, if they go to a close-up.  But they might now know, and they might hide him with the graphic.  See?  But they look good.  Yeah.  They're giant. 
[03:00:30]  Uh, they might not go back.  So what's-  So they're still setting this up?  Yeah, they're still talking, apparently.  This is crazy.  So he wants the number of the bakery, but the woman's already been in his car?  Well, now-  Because the traffic light or the speeding-  This lady said she got a traffic ticket.  Well, they take a picture of your car, and he wasn't driving, but-  No, no, no.  She said she saw video.  Yeah, yeah.  Why would the cops-  They don't give you video, they give you a snapshot.  Hey, asshole, here's you going to a red light.  Or if they pull you over, they just give you nothing. 
[03:01:00]  Besides, how would she know it was the bakery girl?  You can't make those out that clearly.  Oh, boy.  It doesn't make sense.  So now what?  We continue the setup.  We're just-  As far as I was concerned, they didn't know each other.  Okay.  And all of a sudden, she's driving his car.  Okay.  Yeah, that's weird.  That's weird.  Weird.  You don't let another woman drive your car when you're married.  You could drive my car.  It doesn't mean we're sleeping together.  You don't drive another man's car.  Okay.  Okay, but my point is, it's not like there's a smoking gun. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  So I also went up online, and I realized that she has a Facebook account that I did not know about.  Very recent, I guess.  And he has been in touch with her on Facebook a lot, like liking all of her photos and all that, you know, stuff.  You know, after I confronted him about the whole car thing, he didn't seem to, you know, he seemed to have all these explanations, but it still wasn't making sense to me.  Holy fuck, all right. 
[03:02:00]  So there's, like, this caller thing that you can do where it's, like, calling from someone else's number.  And I've done that, like, from her number, I called him, and then just kind of hung up before.  So, I don't know.  Okay, so you're, okay, hold on.  Even he sounded exhausted, and it's terrible.  And they're stretching this out.  I don't know why it's so long.  Why is the setup so long? 
[03:02:30]  Why would you take so long with the setup?  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Now, people don't like listening to the radio that closely.  There's too much shit going on.  You don't want too much shit going on when you listen to a show.  Everything piled up on top of each other.  God, it's terrible.  What, so he was on Facebook in his car at the bakery?  That's what I did.  I don't even know what the bakery has to do with anything.  I know what happened.  Like, I can understand the car going through the red light and the camera, and there's 
[03:03:00]  a girl in it.  That's pretty straightforward.  What about the Facebook page?  What is that?  I don't know.  Facebook.  I can understand if they're trading, like, exchanging fucking messages.  I understand that.  But where does the bakery come into it?  That's where he meant, what happened was the woman has been having a fishy odor in her  vagina.  So he went down to get her a sheet cake to cram into her cunt, and he saw a pretty girl.  A sheet cake and a mallet.  It's like they were too lazy to create their own bit. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  So they took a prepackaged bit, and then they were too lazy to even write it.  To even write, like, a setup.  Wow.  So, now what?  Well, now we have to get...  The payoff.  So, now what?  I'm on the website of Spoof Card.  Hold on, I'm trying to get this thing to connect.  Enter your temporary access code.  If you do not have an access code, press...  Watch. 
[03:04:00]  What's he called?  Spoof Card.  But now it's calling as Candace's number, not our number.  If he picks up, you have to just pretend to be sick.  See how long you can have a conversation.  Where'd the ring go?  Hold off.  He's talking.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Are you all right?  Mm-hmm.  You sure you don't sound okay? 
[03:04:30]  I'm sick.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah.  How are you?  What's that?  How are you?  Oh, you know, I'm fine.  It's busy, but I'm thinking about you, you know?  Oh, that's sweet.  Are you home?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, you just stay right in bed, and I will come visit you this afternoon. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, f***ing me.  Hello?  Oh, we hung up the phone.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  You really did.  You really did, meaning no, he didn't, but I should say that.  I should say you really did.  Right.  You just stay in bed.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  I'm sick.  Oh, good.  You want me to come over and f*** you in the mouth? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Like, I love flu breath.  Yeah, exactly.  And it was just, like, some girl who was talking like this, and it's the perfect disguise.  Yeah, maybe I can eat your diarrhea, asshole, while you're under the weather.  Great news, guys.  There's a suicide at the end of this?  No, I guarantee they call him back, and he picks up the phone.  Oh, yeah.  Why wouldn't they?  Hello?  Robin!  Who is this?  Yo!  Robin, my name is Kane.  Give me a second.  I'm taping you for a radio broadcast, buddy, okay? 
[03:06:00]  No.  All right.  Real quick, tell me about your relationship with Candace.  All right.  That would never happen.  Why the f***?  Absolutely not.  Why the f***?  Why the f***?  The f*** lawyers making them say that beforehand.  I'm taping you for a radio break.  Why?  If the call was real, but he's, like, now trying to spin and going, look, if we say, you know,  we're taping for the radio, that'll make people believe that it's real.  I think it's real.  But what about the call before?  Right.  You've got to inform someone before.  Every single time they're on the air, you stupid f***.  Why the f*** would I agree to that?  The call when you were calling them lying. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  Right.  And showing, like, the whole area they're cheating.  Yeah.  That's the one.  That's the main one where you should say, hey, man, you're on the air.  Okay.  But obviously the bid wouldn't work at that point.  Sounds good.  I'm taping you for a radio show, okay, buddy?  What a...  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  I just f***ing f***ed up and said for a girl to stay in bed to my wife on the phone.  Yeah, put it on the radio.  Tell me about your relationship with Candace. 
[03:07:00]  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  That's not true.  Please.  What is your relationship with Candace?  She's a family friend.  She's a family friend?  Put it on the radio, son.  What is she not?  And you would make house calls for her.  She's a family friend?  Are you kidding me?  I can't believe it.  Okay.  I heard everything you said.  I would go visit a friend of mine if they're sick. 
[03:07:30]  I'm not an idiot.  What conversation are you even talking about?  Okay.  Robin, who did you just talk to on the phone?  Guy messed up his acting, too.  You hear that?  Yeah.  Because he just said...  A guy would...  You heard that?  Yeah.  I'll go...  I'll go...  Yeah.  Huh?  He gave away that he knew she was on the first call.  Right.  Because he goes, I can go visit someone if she's sick.  But no one had mentioned that, I don't think.  Have they?  Yeah.  Everything you said.  He wouldn't...  I would go visit a friend of mine if they're sick.  I'd go visit a friend of mine if they were sick. 
[03:08:00]  If they're sick.  Because, see, this one didn't happen.  Right.  I'm acting this one out.  But I would do this.  Oh, you get it?  Okay.  It tripped him up like Columbo.  Like a guy.  If one of my...  I would do that.  So please believe that I did this for this fake phone call.  Excuse me.  Who were you on the phone with?  I can't believe it.  I heard everything you said.  I would go visit a friend of mine if they're sick. 
[03:08:30]  I'm not an idiot.  What conversation are you even talking about?  Okay.  Robin, who did you just talk to on the phone?  Just right now?  You guys just called me up.  Yeah.  No, no.  Before us, the one you hung up on.  Who were you talking to?  Nobody.  I haven't talked to anybody.  That is actually...  See, why is he mentioning this sick friend if he did that call?  Right, right.  He's a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's poorly written, I guess.  That is so bad.  Thank you. 
[03:09:00]  You're an a**hole.  Before this phone call, you were on the phone with a woman.  Who was sick.  The one who was sick, you remember?  Yeah.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, my God.  Before this phone call, were you on the phone with Candace?  I was...  No.  Are you sure?  You must have had the wrong number.  That wasn't me.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You're sick of a liar.  Keep in mind that this conversation is now on the radio. 
[03:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  And that Katie knows what's going on.  Candace could find out what's going on.  Does she know that Katie doesn't know about your relationship?  Look, I don't know what any of this was about.  Okay.  Did you not just have a conversation with somebody?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Are you guys on the phone right now?  Oh, my God.  The only thing I can tell you right now is we all heard the same conversation, right?  That Robin is denying. 
[03:10:00]  I haven't talked to anybody, but you've had the story.  Oh, my God.  Want more roses?  And then they don't even have an ending.  And then they don't even have an ending.  No, we don't want more roses.  Just cut it right there for time.  And I probably cut, like, three minutes out of the middle of that.  Oh, my God.  It was the longest thing I'd ever heard in my life with no ending.  They can't be doing well in the ratings.  I don't know.  That's hard to listen to.  Horrible.  We have a bonus track.  Oh, I'm going to put this to the room to vote. 
[03:10:30]  It better not be The Fugitive.  No, no, no.  Just a bonus track.  A boner track.  It's quick for them.  Five and a half minutes.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on, man.  I got to piss.  Wow.  This one's uncut.  This is the full, from start to finish, no edits.  Man, do they fucking drag shit.  Wow.  You're a fan of the phone scam, right?  I love a phone scam.  All right, you flip it a little bit.  You call it the cane scam. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, no.  Yes, sir.  Cane scams.  Hello?  So, guys, here's the email that we get from April.  I just moved in less than a month ago with my roommate, Trevor.  It's been absolutely perfect.  Despite people telling me I should not find roommates on Craigslist, we've got to know  each other very well in a non-sexual way.  In parentheses, John, because I'm sure that's exactly what you're thinking.  I would love to see if John could cane scam him.  Cane scam.  What would make him freak out more than anything else? 
[03:11:30]  Well, I'll tell you, if you just got a phone call from someone pretty important about your  roommate.  Yes.  Perhaps missing an important date.  Yes.  Are you ready for a brand new scam?  Heck yeah.  I think this dude had a Trevor had to change his drawer.  Oh, yes.  You know what I think a good cane scam would be?  You saw halfway through an old person's cane, and when they go to use it, they fall down  on their flat tits.  A good cane scam.  Yeah, you put old dynamite in the tip. 
[03:12:00]  So they take one step and their legs blow off.  See, that's a good cane scam.  You put a needle with some ricin on a handle.  If they ask for sugar, you take your shit in the sugar, because they think it's sugar cane.  Sugar cane, but it's shit-ger cane.  Good cane scams.  Yeah, it's April there.  No, no, this isn't April Stone. 
[03:12:30]  Who is this?  Do you know where April is?  Who is this?  Do you know where April is?  Listen, I'm asking you who this is.  This is not April Stone.  How did you get this number?  My name's Officer Mike Stride.  Do you know where April will be right now?  April's in class.  Can I help you?  Can I take a message?  Can I ask, what's your name?  My name is Trevor.  And Trevor, how do you know April?  She's my roommate. 
[03:13:00]  She's your roommate?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Do you know everything about April, then?  What do you mean, do I know everything?  I mean, I am her probation officer, but I'm assuming you knew that.  Yeah, she had one.  Do you hear me?  You're trying to get a hold of April?  Yes.  You've been roommates for how long now?  She's been my roommate for a couple weeks, but I need to know, what is she on probation for?  Well, that's private information.  I'm surprised she didn't tell you about that. 
[03:13:30]  Why are you surprised?  You said it's private information.  I can't wait until the part where he goes, hey, this is Cain.  Cain, you've been Cain scammed.  Aw, what am I?  I love that.  I love that.  Private information, officer, please.  No, the government's not, friend.  The reason I'm calling is I, or rather April, has not checked in the past three weeks.  She's supposed to come in middle of September.  That didn't happen, so I don't want to take it to the next step. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, can you tell me, just my records, do you guys have a lot of sharp objects and  or pets in the place you're living?  I'm just worried about your safety.  I mean, we have knives and tanks, but I don't think, yeah, no, that's it.  But that shouldn't be a problem.  I know.  Has she been acting different recently as if she's hiding something?  No, not at all.  Didn't mention owing money to anybody?  Is she still? 
[03:14:30]  No.  So why would you think she hadn't stopped by her probation officer's office in three weeks then?  Oh, God.  I've got to be honest with you.  You're making me really nervous here.  Are you sure there's nothing that you can tell me about April?  How do you move in with somebody and not know if they may or may not be a convicted felon?  Well, I don't do the background checks, so.  All right, so I guess if you've got nothing else, give her the message that I called,  and I'll check back soon.  Okay.  All right, bye. 
[03:15:00]  You're already laughing.  Oh, my God, she's calling me.  All right, don't pick up.  We'll call him back, right?  Okay.  Hello?  Hey.  Oh, I'm sorry that I missed your call.  I was in class.  I think it's probably better if you come back to the apartment and we talk about this.  What?  I just got a call from your probation officer.  Really?  Why did he call you? 
[03:15:30]  That's a really good question.  I have no idea how he has my number.  And also, I have no idea that you have, like, you're on probation?  Probation?  Like, okay, don't freak out.  Totally not a big deal.  I missed the check-in a couple weeks ago.  It's really, seriously, not a big deal.  It's just a little thing that I did, like, years and years and years ago.  And it's, you know.  Tell us all about it in real time.  Well, you need to tell me what happened. 
[03:16:00]  Tell me what happened.  And it's totally not.  I'm not really going to talk about it.  I dated a black guy.  I want you out.  The girl had a medical condition, and she was going to die anyway.  It's just really, it's not a big deal.  Don't freak out.  You never told me about this.  We're living together.  Just relax.  It's going to be fine.  Okay.  He just needs a phone call.  I'm going to give him a call.  I'm going to tell him that I'll stop by. 
[03:16:30]  So she's on probation for killing somebody?  I heard someone say, hey, Trevor.  You ready?  Is it, is it, hey, Trevor.  Yeah, this is Cain from fucking Bloody Bloody.  You've been Cain scammed.  You love the reveals.  I love a good reveal.  Yeah.  Okay.  He just, he just needs a phone call.  I'm going to give him a call.  I'm going to tell him that I'll stop by.  It's fine.  I can't believe you didn't tell me this.  Trevor.  So you didn't know where she was.  Uh-oh. 
[03:17:00]  Trevor.  Trevor.  Okay.  Yes, I'm here.  I'm here.  You knew where she was the whole time.  I told you she was in class.  No, you did not.  Why did you, why did you lie, Trevor?  I am so f***ing freaked out right now.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like I'm in a movie.  What's going on here?  Well, not a movie, per se.  More like a radio show.  Terrible.  Yeah, it is terrible.  Intern John Danny Bell and Cain from The Cain Show. 
[03:17:30]  You have got to be f***ing kidding me.  April, did you do this?  Of course I did.  No.  They just guessed.  She's not a felon, by the way.  This is about to be a murder.  Cainscams are pre-taped and possibly edited for broadcast with permission granted from all participants.  See?  See?  That's how...  Why do they have to play that?  Yeah, and then the lawyers make them do that on top of it, proving that the whole thing is fake.  Cainscams are totally fake.  The Clear Channel stations and bigger markets make them do that. 
[03:18:00]  Why?  It's just something they started a few years ago.  Yeah, but if it's fake, it's fake.  Who gives a f***?  And it is absolutely fake.  So then they tell you in the end how fake it really is, that everyone agreed to it beforehand.  It says beforehand.  I don't think it's over.  What?  Is that call over?  Yeah.  Oh!  Shut up!  Yeah!  Wow! 
[03:18:30]  Gotta apologize to the audience.  Yeah.  That was f***ing some horrible radio right there.  Got someone from California calling in.  Hello?  Hey!  I thought you guys did great with it.  It was a slow burn today, but it turned out well.  Oh.  You liked the...  No, it said Quinn from California, so I was thinking it was Colin to beat the s*** out  of us.  Oh!  I wasn't going for a compliment.  I really thought it might be Colin just beating the s*** out of us, because that was  rough today.  Oh!  Hi! 
[03:19:00]  Hi!  Hi, Clint.  Thank you.  The sad state of radio.  Terrible.  Pointing it out.  Holy...  That's part of our Jocktober bit.  It was awfulness.  I'll be in Rochester this weekend.  Oh, Rochester!  Yes, you will.  Friday, Saturday at the Comedy Club.  Nice.  And me and Sam are going to be here for a little while after interviewing Jenna Jameson.  Jenna Jameson's coming in in a few minutes.  I'm going to listen as I drive.  That should be very cool. 
[03:19:30]  Indeed he do.  So stay right here for more live radio with Jim Norton and Sam.  I wanted to tell you, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Rest Development.  You ready for the next big thing from Netflix, huh?  Prepare yourself for Notorious, Netflix's newest comedy special.  That's starring international stand-up sensation Russell Peters.  Russell started doing stand-up as a kid there in Toronto, and now he's one of the biggest  comedians in the world.  He's got over 75 million views on YouTube, nearly a million Facebook fans, and one of 
[03:20:00]  the most diverse audiences on the planet.  He sold out arenas like Madison Square Garden and Sydney's Royal Opera House.  Also launching with the new special Notorious, Russell Peters vs. the World.  Exclusive four-part series takes you behind the scenes on Russell's tour, has tons of great  outtakes and interviews with his family and friends, Dune to Miss, Notorious, and Russell  Peters vs. the World, now streaming only on Netflix.  Here comes the light of the day. 
[03:20:30]  Light of the day.  It has been screwed so tightly.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  The Sirius XM.  This is after O.P. and Anthony Live. 
[03:21:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir.  Jim Norton is here.  Of course.  And we are waiting on Miss Jenna Jameson.  Yeah.  I haven't seen her in quite a long time.  Oh, right, because you hosted the AVNs with her.  Yeah.  Correct?  I'm assuming she'll remember me, but I don't know.  I never feel I'm very memorable.  Why, Jim?  Why?  I just don't.  People remember me because of my hair.  Yeah, they remember you visually.  Yeah, that's it.  But that's all you need.  Yeah. 
[03:21:30]  All you need is a hook.  Yeah, whatever it is that gets them to remember you.  I haven't read the book.  We just got it.  Yeah, it's called Sugar, and it's basically, I think it's like Jenna's version of Fifty Shades.  Okay.  It's like an erotica novel.  It's supposed to be porno, like, for women.  You know what I mean?  It's like written word and lusty and smoky and like Fifty Shades of Grey.  I never read Fifty Shades of Grey.  Well, neither did I, but we're not women, are we?  No.  But they're having trouble casting that for some reason. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, the guy from Sons of Anarchy was supposed to be the lead character, whatever his name  was, Mr. Grey, and then, I don't know, he dropped out.  I think from what I read, he agreed to do the movie without reading the script, and then  he read the script and was like, I'm not doing this.  Is it awful, you think?  Probably.  I mean, from what I've heard, the book is not a well-written book.  It's just like it's so sexual, like all these housewives just got all horned up by it.  You know what I mean?  So it's not that this Fifty Shades of Grey was this greatly written book, but I'm assuming 
[03:22:30]  Sugar is a very well-written book.  That's Jenna Jameson's new book.  And where is she in the...  I don't know.  She should be on her way in.  It'll be interesting to see what kind of state she's in, because, I don't know, she's been  on Twitter lately talking about her custody issues with Tito Ortiz and their kids.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That was the latest thing she was doing, but she's also, she's been going through a lot  lately.  TMZ was just reporting that she lost her house. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you never know how much of it is true on TMZ, but we'll have her in here to ask  her.  Yeah, TMZ is, sometimes I don't, I don't know exactly how much they get right.  Right.  I don't know if they get it all right, or if they just get half of it right.  But she was like, she's, so many people were introduced to porn through Jenna Jameson.  I would say my, the vast majority of my generation anyway, that was the first porn star that you 
[03:23:30]  knew what her name was.  She was definitely the first kind of mainstream, other than like, I mean, Linda Loveless, but  that was more of an infamous thing.  Lovelace?  Is that it?  Linda Loveless?  Loveless Lovelace?  Lovelace.  Well, it's like a 70s porn star.  I'm sorry.  She's different.  She's, no, she's more than 70s.  Linda Lovelace is kind of the one who started it all.  Yeah, yeah.  But not Linda Loveless.  That's awful.  It doesn't make a difference at this point.  It does.  Linda Loveless implies no one loved her.  Linda Lovelace is in her porn name. 
[03:24:00]  Is erotic.  And Deep Throat wasn't even that sexy.  It was okay.  Yeah, but it was probably the first time anything had reached that big of an audience that was  that sort of erotic as well as being tongue in cheek.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Stupid orgasm in the throat.  I watched a little taboo too last night.  I was jerking off.  You love that taboo.  Oh my God.  It's so hot.  What year was that made?  82.  Curdie Stevens directed it.  And that's the one about like...  Incest.  Right.  You like that.  But I don't like incest in real life. 
[03:24:30]  Like the idea...  How do you know though?  Because the idea of it repulses me.  It repulses me.  Apparently not.  Nah, but in the films, it's just different.  It's like murder.  We all like Scarface, but you don't want to go out and shoot somebody with a fucking machine gun.  We don't like jerk off to it.  So what?  You still enjoy it.  Is it the theme or is it the two porn stars that are in there?  Because you always talk about those two all the time.  No, it's the theme.  No, it's the people because the theme is usually done wrong.  But there's one where the sister hops in the fucking bed and she's blowing the dad while the mom is sleeping.  It's so hot.  But I'll bet if you had family that looked like those porn stars, you would think about it. 
[03:25:00]  Nah, I have cute aunts and stuff like that or cousins and I can't even.  No.  You can't?  No.  You like that though when the girl jumps into bed with her dad while the mom is sleeping?  It's so dirty.  Oh.  Because the blowjob, I like the girl so much.  Mm-hmm.  And the blowjob she's giving is so hot.  It's just like this tentative looking up.  Her name is Dorothy LeMay.  Yeah.  I love Dorothy LeMay.  Well, and the whole idea of it is such like filth.  Like she had to have a cock in her mouth so bad that she would throw all societal rules out the window. 
[03:25:30]  Well, she had already fucked her brother.  She already had done that.  Did they?  Who are we waiting for?  I don't know.  It wasn't scheduled until 10.15, so we're still waiting for her.  Roland said she's here.  She's here.  They haven't brought her down.  I don't know.  I'll find out.  Did anybody tell Roland that we were ready?  He was here when the break was happening.  Okay.  Very strange.  I'll go find him.  So she had already fucked her brother?  Yeah.  Oof. 
[03:26:00]  Travis is coming in here.  Okay.  Is she coming?  Well.  What's going on?  She's in the green room.  Why?  Okay.  They're just waking her up and getting her ready.  Oh, okay.  Waking her up?  That's what I heard.  She just got here.  Maybe she's tired.  Of what?  Oh, boy.  No, I won't.  Okay.  But Roland will be bringing her back momentarily.  They said waking her up?  That's what Roland told me, yeah.  Hopefully he's incorrect because that would be... 
[03:26:30]  That would be great.  Maybe she's tired.  You think?  Yeah.  It's a long night.  Well, maybe she's got a sleep study today.  Maybe she's in the same boat as you who stayed up all night.  Oh, they're coming right now.  Oh, great.  I was going to write something down, but I'll save it for later.  Save it for later.  Yeah.  That's not her.  It's a black man.  No, there's a bald black man walking around.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's coming.  Yeah, I don't know if it's...  The internet's attitude is so hot.  I don't know if it's true, but Troy was telling me that her ex-husband owns all her shit now. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, Jay?  Yeah.  And in a bad way.  She took all her money after they split.  And all the rights to her club, Jenna, and all that stuff.  She's like together.  Yeah, and apparently that she lost a lot of it.  I mean, her house just went for like $1.9 million, is what TMZ said on foreclosure or whatever.  The bank auctioned it off, so I don't know if she's got anything left.  She was the number one chick in the world for a hot minute.  Yeah, for a long time. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  And there won't be any more like that, because I think the business has changed so much.  Oh, yeah.  That it's impossible.  And everything's...  Especially to make money and stuff.  Yeah, it's very difficult.  Jenna Jameson.  Hello, Jenna.  Welcome.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  We're live on the air now.  Wow.  Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?  Sexy.  How is everything?  Good.  Good.  You got the book coming out, sugar?  I do.  That's very exciting.  You think so?  I think so. 
[03:28:00]  It's a titillating book, is it not?  We just got it.  They didn't give us time to read it.  We'd probably be wrecked if we had read it.  Yeah, it's very titillating.  It is, right?  Well, you guys have figured out that the females, they like to be excited with their brains.  With their minds.  Right.  Yes.  You can't make porno movies that will go towards all the women the way these books will.  Is that right?  Exactly.  I agree.  What mistake, let me ask you, what mistake do men make trying to turn women on? 
[03:28:30]  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  I miss you.  It's good to see you.  You know, Jim worries that he's not memorable.  He was afraid you wouldn't remember him.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  I'm a baby.  That's so sweet.  You never know.  Time passes.  People grow apart.  Not from you, Jim.  So what mistake do you think guys make when they're trying to turn a woman on?  What do they do wrong?  Um, well, guys make a huge amount of mistakes, period.  Um, I don't think they buy books for girls. 
[03:29:00]  So, um, this book, I think, is, uh, something that a woman can read on.  They can, they can be on the, on the, uh, in their hotel.  Right.  They can chill on their hotel.  They can, they can, like, relax and, and just read it and not worry about whether or not they're going to be judged. 
[03:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know, which is cool.  Right.  There's not a, a, great, it's just a little strawberry on the cover.  It's not some graphic thing.  People aren't going to get judgy.  Yeah.  Are you doing okay?  In general, are you all right?  Because on Twitter, you seem to be a little bit unhappy and you've been kind of, you know, vocal about it.  Are you all right?  Well, it's good to be vocal, right?  Yeah.  You get it off your chest, that's the worst.  You keep it all bottled up. 
[03:30:00]  Mm-hmm.  Do you think it helps when you, when you're taught, when you, because you speak for yourself  on Twitter, which is good, and it prevents lies from being spread if you can speak for  yourself?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what was the question?  Oh, do you think it helps that you can, uh, I was asked if you were okay.  I mean, if you're doing all right, because you seem like the things that have been happening.  Yeah, I'm bummed.  You're bummed?  I'm super bummed, yeah.  Why are you bummed?  Um, I have, uh, uh, bad acts. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  And it's a complicated situation, too, because everybody, being such public figures, everybody  in the world is going to have an opinion on it, right?  Um, yeah.  And?  But, yeah, no worries.  Look.  Well, um, uh, yeah, we'll definitely, if you want to talk about the book, of course, we will 
[03:31:00]  talk about it, but, uh, all right, let me ask you this, about this.  Um, is it hard, uh, when you've been talking about stuff that happens in real life that's  unpleasant, how hard is it to turn around and be sexy or to put on a sex?  But, seriously, like, like, when you have to, you have to, you know, be erotic or you have  to be a certain way.  I'm always sexy.  But, I mean, it's hard to get that mindset.  Even if I'm sad, I'm sexy.  Yeah, you do look sexy.  And you smell very good, by the way. 
[03:31:30]  Thank you.  I don't want to say it's always creepy when I compliment people on their smell.  Yeah, it's a little better when you do it to women, though.  When the male celebrities come in and you're complimenting them on their smells, it's even creepier.  Yeah.  Well, you're doing signings, too, which is nice.  Yeah.  Um.  That's the good stuff.  Are you signing today?  Tomorrow.  Um, tomorrow at noon, I think.  I saw the ad in the Daily News.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing, after all these years, that, uh, you still get such a huge fan reaction 
[03:32:00]  for your projects?  Are, are, are they still with you?  Yeah, I'm, I'm very proud of all my, all my amazing fans.  And are you happy?  Because there's probably never going to be another person who achieves what you did,  because the business is very different now than it was, and it seems like it's hard  for people to become these gigantic name performers, because there's so much free stuff  out there.  It's like, I don't know how anybody makes.  It won't happen.  It won't happen again. 
[03:32:30]  It won't, right?  No, it won't.  And, and, uh, you know, I feel bad, but you know what?  I worked my butt off, and I have turned into, uh, somebody that knows Jenna Jameson.  Mm-hmm.  Like, people know me.  They know Jenna.  Well, yeah, it's a household name.  We were saying before, I mean, there's a whole generation of people that the only name 
[03:33:00]  they know associated with the adult industry is your name.  You know what I mean?  It's something everybody knows.  Is that, are you, are you happy to be associated with the adult industry, uh, or do you wish you  had done more mainstream stuff?  Uh, no, I'm happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think you got out at the right time?  I.  Because it seems like before the mega sites all started, you kind of, you got out right  before that happened.  I knew exactly when to get out and when to get back in.  Is there any way to make money in the business now? 
[03:33:30]  It's because everything's for free on the internet.  Oh, there's.  How's the money made?  They make money right now.  How's that?  I'm not telling.  You won't?  Why not?  Because I'm busy making the money.  You are.  You're still, but when you went, you said you got back in, you're not performing anymore.  No.  Or did you start?  Are you, are you producing or are you?  No.  No?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, she's got secrets.  She's got secrets.  But I am making good money.  Are you?  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  That's good.  And I mean, and part of it is also finding other projects.  You know what I mean?  To be able to, outside of the adult industry, like the book, sugar.  I mean, and also, I would imagine that this book has to be helped by the fact that your  autobiography was ridiculously successful.  It really was.  Yeah.  And this is a trilogy.  So this is our first.  There's going to be two more.  Are they written yet or are they still?  The second is written. 
[03:34:30]  The third isn't finished.  But I'm telling you, this one is like sex personified.  Does it help?  Like when you got, like if things are going on that aren't happy necessarily, does it  help to have a project that at least is coming out that you can kind of focus on?  That kind of helps sometimes, I think.  Yeah.  I can focus.  Yeah.  Why was the autobiography never made into a movie?  They won't pay me enough.  Is that it?  Yeah.  How much is enough?  Well, you want to know a number? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  I mean, because there might be somebody listening who was willing to do it.  Because, I mean, it was a really like.  It was a bestselling book.  Yeah.  And it was a compelling story.  And you would think that that would be a no brainer.  Well, I mean, my thing was I really wanted at least five million.  Mm-hmm.  And they weren't coming close to that.  Well, somewhat, but.  Close is not five million. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Right.  I understand.  Yeah.  You got to set your boundaries and not pass them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So are you going to be able, do you think, to kind of straighten out what the things that  are, because, you know, I don't like to see you unhappy.  It's kind of, you know, it's not, I don't like to see it.  Yeah.  Are you going to be able to straighten everything out and kind of move forward and be all right?  I don't know.  Ask him.  How do people react to you kind of being public about that?  Like, you know, you say it's good to get it off your chest. 
[03:36:00]  But then how would you say, especially on Twitter, because you have gone on Twitter a couple times,  a few days ago you did, and kind of just brought up your kids and custody issues and issues with  your ex-husband.  And, um, how have people reacted to you being so public?  It's so weird how people, um, they talk about me saying stuff, but he's been saying stuff for months. 
[03:36:30]  So is this kind of you finally responding?  I guess nobody really cares about what he has to say.  Do you think, are they picking on you specifically, do you think?  Like, I don't care, I, picking?  No.  Do you think they're giving you a harder time than they're giving him?  Well, he's a good liar.  Because I read a couple, there's a couple, it's weird how when people get mad at you,  or anybody that's been in the business, the first thing they hit you with,  who used to do porn, like that just becomes a weapon of any, whenever you're talking about 
[03:37:00]  children and custody, immediately they start in with that.  I read, I like the fact that you came back at them and you were like, fuck you.  Like, I like that there was a harsh, that's the way you should respond to that.  You didn't, you didn't ignore it and you didn't say anything phony, polite.  So I think maybe, maybe that's why people are focusing a bit more on you because you kind of,  you know, people kind of know that they're going to get a response from you.  Yeah, true.  That's probably very true. 
[03:37:30]  Do you regret the public honesty or are you happy that you're kind of...  No, I will always be honest, always.  But do you see a resolution?  Because again, if you've got a good project going on, I mean, it's like no one can say  that you're not having a good professional life because if you have a first of three books coming out,  I mean, you know, you definitely got stuff going on.  Oh yeah, I have a lot of things going on, but you know, my main priority are my kids.  Of course.  Is there anybody in your life trying to get you to shut up? 
[03:38:00]  No.  Everybody's happy that you're just, yeah, tell the truth.  Yeah.  That's good.  I mean, the truth is, is where it's at.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got to be truthful.  So, you know, he'll, he'll get to the point where he, he feels the same way.  I think.  I hope.  Do you, I haven't, I don't know as much about, are you fighting to get them back?  I mean, or, or, oh, you are.  Okay.  How long has it been since you saw them? 
[03:38:30]  A few months.  And yeah, and the issue where she was saying on Twitter that he, he wouldn't let her call,  he wouldn't let her FaceTime.  Right.  Nothing.  And so she, I guess you felt like nobody realized that not only were you not getting,  you weren't getting to talk to your children, you weren't, so you had to kind of tell the  world because they were hearing one side of the story.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's, he's kind of, uh, told a story that, that people don't really understand. 
[03:39:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, um, I hope that he gets sober.  Is that the problem, do you think?  I hope he gets sober.  Okay.  And, um, I hope he does well with his fight here soon.  I just want to, um, make sure that I am with my kids. 
[03:39:30]  Obviously, at one point you were in love.  At what point does this thing become the opposite of that?  Um, um, there was a lot of violence, so, I, I was just done.  And do you think you'll be able to resolve it and, and take care of what you need to take  care of?  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And being honest, I think, again, if you, if you, at least if you're talking publicly,  it makes it harder for things to happen that nobody, that nobody sees if, if, if you, too 
[03:40:00]  many people don't talk about what's going on.  Yeah.  And then nobody has any idea that it's happening.  That's the thing is I feel like, um, you know, I'll get on Twitter cause I'll get mad  and I'll be like, rah, go crazy on Twitter and people will think I'm nuts.  But in reality, it, it's really just me trying to tell people what is really happening, what, 
[03:40:30]  what's, what's really going on, you know?  Um, so it, it, it, it's kind of sad, you know, I just want to see my kids.  I want to be with my babies and, um, and work.  That's my best.  And are you, are you allowed to see them?  If you like, say you want to go and see them or you, you are allowed to.  Yeah.  What's prevented you in the last few months?  Um, actually he, um, it's kind of a long story. 
[03:41:00]  He, um, so he, um, he had a, uh, judge make a, a huge judgment against me while I was away. 
[03:41:30]  Um, so I couldn't go home and I couldn't see my children.  Um, so I've been away from my home and I haven't seen my kids for a very, very long time.  Um, I'm able to see them only two days a week and, um, they charge me $400 an hour. 
[03:42:00]  You have to pay to see your kids?  Yeah.  Why do they have, is it a supervised visit?  And they, and you have to pay for the other person to be there.  Which makes no sense.  No.  Yeah, because in a way that's saying you're unfit to be with your.  Because I've always taken care of my babies.  I mean, they've always been like with me. 
[03:42:30]  And, and, and again, I don't know all the inner workings, obviously.  And, and I'm asking you this just, you know, cause we all, whenever something happens, there's  always my part and then there's the other person's part.  There's always, there's always two.  Do you, do you look at it all and go, okay, well, you know what?  Maybe I did this and I have to fix this before I can.  Is there anything that you need to fix?  No.  You feel it's, it's, you feel it's all coming from the other side?  I, I, I, you know, I really feel like there has to be a point where him and I just relax and, and we're okay. 
[03:43:00]  It's, what he's doing isn't about us.  It's about, he, he wants to fight.  You know, I don't want to fight. 
[03:43:30]  Are you guys beyond, cause people have come back from, I guess, longer breakups or whatever.  Is there, is there any chance that you both find some kind of common ground and maybe.  I hope so.  I don't understand how he could get that kind of custody of the kids if, based on the stuff you're saying in terms of drug use and violence and things like that,  that you would think, if that were true, that the, the judge would not allow those kids to be with him, wouldn't you?  Well, what, what happened was he, um, I was working. 
[03:44:00]  I was out of town in Vegas working and he, uh, he, he had some sort of, um, I don't even know what it's called.  Um.  Was it a legal term?  Yeah.  Well, he, so, the moment, um, I got back home, he was like, you're not allowed back at the house. 
[03:44:30]  You're done.  No more.  And what was that based on?  Um, the judge.  Or what, or what, or what was said to the judge that may have even been bullshit?  Yeah, like, what, what was the incident that would not allow you back in your home?  Yeah, according to them.  Uh, he said that I'm nuts.  Just generally crazy? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Which is odd, because I've taken care of my kids from the moment they were born.  And they're like four now, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So if you get a, you know, and Jen is here, obviously, she's plugging her book, uh, Sugar,  which comes out, uh, I'm guessing tomorrow, right?  Tuesday.  Usually books come out on Tuesday.  Yes.  And, uh, she's doing a signing at noon.  Um, I will give, we don't have the information, but it's in the daily news today.  That's how I learned about it.  Yeah.  It's such a good book. 
[03:45:30]  So support, uh, you know, Jenna and be nice to her and go down to the signing and say  hello and get a book signed.  And if anybody's going to be writing about erotica, this is a brand you can trust, I  think.  It would be me.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  And you really do smell good.  I've said that before, but I'll say it again.  So I don't know how close people can get to you when you're signing, but you just try  not to be too...  I always get that thing about smell.  Yeah?  Do you smell good?  Yeah.  I've heard that before.  Well, it's a nice quality.  It beats hearing the opposite. 
[03:46:00]  It beats hearing that you smell like shit because I've been around enough people that  do.  You kind of smell weird.  Yeah.  Oh, you smell like feet.  And how quickly does a hot girl become not hot when she smells like shit?  Yeah.  I can handle a little armpit odor though.  I don't mind that as much.  Yeah.  You don't have any.  I'm saying...  I don't.  No, no.  But I'm saying in general that doesn't...  No, I smell good.  You do.  And you're filming me doing this.  It's so funny.  It's important.  Oh, thank you, Eric.  Tomorrow at noon, Barnes and Noble. 
[03:46:30]  That's the big Barnes and Noble here in New York.  They know that there's going to be a big event.  It's on Fifth Avenue and 46th Street.  And if you Twitter it, I'll retweet you.  You know I will.  At noon to meet Jenna and get your book signed.  Because you haven't done as many public appearances like this lately.  So it's a cool chance for fans to go down and be able to say hello.  Yeah.  And just take a look in person like we all do.  Do the fans ever get kind of creepy?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Ever.  Yeah.  I had one guy.  I was here a couple weeks ago and he tried to get in my car.  You tried to get in your car?  Yeah.  With you?  Yeah.  Do you have security...  I'm assuming you have a security task force with you at all times.  No, I usually just travel with my girlfriend and my friend.  Yeah, yeah.  My girlfriend.  Sure.  Yeah.  But yeah, he was like, yeah, we're gonna... 
[03:47:30]  We're gonna...  Fuck.  I was like, oh my god, no.  How'd you get him out of the car?  Yeah, how did you?  I'm mean.  I can be mean.  You're okay being mean when you need to?  I can be mean.  Yeah, so it's like, take your ass the other way.  Well, how often does that happen?  How often do you go to signings or even back in the day when you were going to clubs and  stuff and people think they're gonna be able to go meet you and get to fuck you? 
[03:48:00]  I get it a lot.  Yeah.  Well, you still dance, right?  Do you still...  Oh, you don't?  Oh, okay.  When you...  So, but when you would dance at one point, I'm sure you had to deal with it, like guys  who were fans thinking they were gonna say the one special thing that was gonna lure  you away.  They were gonna woo her?  Yeah, or they were gonna be the different guy.  Yeah.  There's nothing worse than when a guy tries to pick up a girl and be the different guy,  like say the stuff that you haven't heard.  And it's fairly pathetic.  Has there ever been a guy at a signing that's been able to charm you or are you... 
[03:48:30]  A couple.  Really?  What'd they say?  You might as well give it away now.  Yeah, it's not gonna work a second time.  I don't know.  I was young then.  I was very, very young.  There was one boy that I ended up hanging out with, but yeah.  Wow.  Nowadays, I'm so single and so in need of a man.  You don't want to say that.  Now there's gonna be 150,000 more creeps showing up in these. 
[03:49:00]  You just sold a lot more books.  People are gonna go and just sign it and then put their numbers in it and ask you to fucking...  Okay.  So you prefer being in a relationship than being single?  Um, I just like to have sex.  Oh.  Well, that seems like it'd be a lot more reasonable to accomplish.  That's not that lofty of a goal, I wouldn't say.  It doesn't seem like it'd be very difficult for you to accomplish if you wanted that.  I'm sure you'd be able to find...  You're not having trouble having sex now. 
[03:49:30]  I am.  How is that possible?  I think I scare guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, because you're this iconic sexual being.  Yeah.  That's the beauty of me.  I'd tell you I'm awful going into it.  Same for you.  I know you'd feel it.  You'd be fine with it?  You'd just say, look, this is gonna be awful, but we're gonna go for it?  Oh, yeah.  The first thing I'd say to her, I'd be like, Janet, don't get your hopes up.  It's not gonna be terrific.  I'll tell you to lower all expectations. 
[03:50:00]  But yeah, I think that's what it is.  It is scary when you're meeting somebody who's so...  Because you're known...  Not only are you Janet Jameson, but the guys you've slept with are fucking professional fuckers.  I mean, they're good.  That's what they think of.  They think that there's no way they can do the same thing.  We've all seen you get better than we can give.  So it's like...  But...  It's intimidating.  I mean... 
[03:50:30]  It's...  Yeah.  But does it feel...  Like, I watched...  You know, I was on one of your sets, and I've watched a few films be made.  Yeah.  And it seems like it's a lot of...  It's done for what's visually appealing.  A lot of it is not done for what's necessarily gonna feel good.  Exactly.  It's like what looks good is not...  Like the bouncing really fast and hard.  I could never tolerate that.  That does not feel good.  It doesn't, right?  It does not feel good.  Bruises.  Yeah.  So when was the last time you had sex?  Um, it's been about seven months. 
[03:51:00]  No.  Can you believe I'm counting?  That's crazy.  Seven months.  Well, it's obviously by choice that you're very picky.  No.  Well...  Okay.  Not that picky, huh?  No.  Not at seven months in.  Uh, no.  You know what you ought to do to break your streak?  I'm telling you, just to get yourself out of a slump.  Tyler, what do you think?  Do you have an idea?  Sometimes if you pick off a comedian, that's the best way to break yourself out of a slump,  because then your confidence is right back through the roof. 
[03:51:30]  Do you know any, or...?  I'm just saying in general.  I don't think it may be in particular.  Okay.  That's the biggest laugh we got out of general.  What's the most...  It's the most absurd premise.  It really is.  I couldn't have said anything more ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever been charmed in an interview, and then end up going home with them?  I haven't, but I leave things open with them.  Well, it's gotta be hard, too, for you, because it's like if a guy's worth a lot of money, 
[03:52:00]  like, he never knows why someone's talking to him.  You never know if you're with a guy.  Is he talking to you, or is it only, hey, I love her for movies, and I'm listening to  nothing she says, and I only care about her as this movie?  That's exactly how I feel.  So how do you tell the difference?  I don't.  I don't know.  It's hard.  I don't know.  I kind of just move around if I think he's sexy.  I'm kind of into beards right now. 
[03:52:30]  They're very in style.  Are they?  Beards?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially now, after you just said that.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay, yeah.  Nobody was shaving.  Yeah, like a guy with beards.  And you're thin.  Why are you so thin?  Oh, thank you.  I was just an unpleasant fat body.  Sorry, I started working out.  You got so thin on me, baby.  Yeah, I was just really unhappy with how I looked.  I see photos of us from 2000.  It was January of 2004.  And I'm just, it's the worst picture. 
[03:53:00]  I mean, you look fucking amazing.  And I'm just a fat head.  It's a humiliating photo that we have together.  Jenny, you've lost a lot of weight, too.  Um, actually, I've gained weight.  Well, you've, first you lost a lot.  I can see a low booty.  Oh, I see a low.  There is some booty going on there.  It looks very nice.  Yeah.  I've gained some weight.  Are you more comfortable when you have a booty?  Yeah, I like weight.  I'm more comfortable when you have a booty, too. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they do.  I like a nice hiney.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very pleasant.  Yeah, especially a woman who's proud of it.  Yeah, nice round boobs.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was trying not to look, but, yeah, they are, it's nice to have a, there's nothing  worse than somebody who has, like, just a flat, awful ass.  Well, I gotcha.  Yeah.  Do you, nice and round.  Do you work it out specifically?  I do.  What do you do?  I work really hard.  I, weights.  On the ass aerobics.  Yes, you know how to get it done. 
[03:54:00]  Would you say ass aerobic?  Yeah.  Yeah, kind of like that.  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  So, you don't have, I don't believe you're having trouble meeting a guy.  I think that you just can't find someone you like.  Because, you know.  Yeah, I think, you know, I'm still kind of figuring out what's going on.  And you want to be, are you actually divorced now or just separate?  I don't even know the.  I'm divorced.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Well, that's the other intimidating thing. 
[03:54:30]  Is that you've been, you know, people know the guys that you've been with.  So, whether it's Tito who's a professional fighter, whether it's a rock star, whether  it's, you know, all these guys are like, how does the typical dude live up to that, you  know?  And you might be bored with the regular guy.  That's what I was thinking too.  Like, not necessarily because.  I'd be so much happier with the regular guy.  But could you adapt to a regular guy lifestyle?  I went apple picking this weekend and that was the highlight.  Yeah.  I'd be cool with that. 
[03:55:00]  You think so?  If a guy wanted you to make meatloaf.  Okay.  Come on, Jen.  I'll be home in a half hour.  I'm tired from work.  Yeah.  I'm going to make a meatloaf.  You'd hate that.  Yeah.  Okay.  No.  Yeah.  That would be awful.  Right.  You still, you know.  You guys got all sad really quick.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No.  I can do that.  I want, I want a real life.  You want a real life.  And you want to be, I mean, you're away from the business pretty much. 
[03:55:30]  I mean, other than, do you still have any attachment at all?  No.  Or you don't go to the events?  No.  You have no desire?  Do you miss the people at all?  Were there any of the people that you kind of miss?  No.  It left a really bad thing for you.  Bad taste?  Oh, no.  Not really.  It was just time for me to leave.  And I say you didn't leave with any friends in the business.  You just kind of left them.  Um. 
[03:56:00]  It was just time for me to go.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  It was time.  I mean, you can only do it for so long.  You can't be like 20 and pounding your life away.  And then 40 comes around.  Right.  And your life's been pounded away.  Right.  You did it.  So I was like, all right, it's time. 
[03:56:30]  It's time.  It's time to get out.  Yeah.  Do you still keep your, is there anything, are you competitive at all?  Like, do you look at young porno stars now and thinking, oh, I don't want her to be as  famous as I was.  I don't want, you don't care.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More power to them.  Yeah.  None of them will get the name.  I mean, Bella Donna had a huge name and there's a few girls.  I love Bella.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's very nice.  Yeah.  But most of them, you know, will never even get close, especially in this day and age.  It's just, it's not going to happen.  I mean, the turnover is ridiculous now. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  Just a new girl every three months.  You're one of the few, I see a lot of people that get out of it that are very, very, in  very bad shape.  And you're one of the few examples I can give of people who got out absolutely on top  and absolutely in a good place.  Oh, without, like, my crying.  I'm sorry.  I cry sometimes.  I cried watching Gravity.  Yeah, me too.  I did.  I'm the worst.  Me too.  I bought the backstory.  I was all sad and shit.  You were?  Yeah. 
[03:57:30]  I'm a fucking blubbering zilch.  Okay.  I don't feel so bad.  Yeah.  No, it happens.  And, you know, I hope that things work out for you.  I don't like to see you, you know, unhappy.  But, you know, and I wouldn't, we wouldn't have mentioned any of this stuff, but, you  know, again, it's been very much talk about on Twitter and, you know, it's better  to hear your side of it.  Do you still, do you still, do you still like to party?  When it's time to party, you know, go out at night.  Actually, I'm sober.  You are?  Mm-hmm.  So, when was the last time you did any drugs or whatever? 
[03:58:00]  Oh, it's been seven years.  Wow.  Well, congratulations.  Yeah.  Thanks.  And that's everything?  That's alcohol, pills, the whole deal?  Oh, I have a beer here and there.  Oh, God.  But us and Matt, no.  Nothing else.  Where are you living?  Are you on the West Coast?  Newport.  I thought you were in, I think you, every time I'm in Arizona.  How long, this is how fucking out of the loop I am.  How long since you lived in Arizona? 
[03:58:30]  Oh, it's been a while.  Oh, it has been.  Okay.  Someone's like, yeah, generally I'm going to listen around here, but you don't.  Glad I didn't try to look you up.  I would have felt like a fucking idiot going to the wrong house.  So you want to get your kids back and you want to get things on track and move forward  and find a guy.  California, though, might be a little, that's probably a more difficult place for you to  maintain this sober lifestyle, I would think.  There's a lot going on, just because there's so much going on.  You know, you go to Arizona and you can chill out.  Yeah. 
[03:59:00]  Or a place like Arizona.  You can go to Maine and chill out.  It doesn't have to be Arizona.  Yeah.  It's easy.  Yeah.  Super easy for me.  Yeah.  In California, I would think it would be a little bit more, a little better with splitting  things up.  Like, you know what I mean?  If you're having this trouble, I'm surprised it's in California.  Because California, you know, California seems like they're a little bit more, you know,  even-handed with stuff like that.  Yeah.  Well, I hope you're in the process of writing it and getting it back to where you want it 
[03:59:30]  to be and, you know, getting everything okay.  Thanks.  And the book is called Sugar, by the way.  It's Jenna Jameson with Hope Tarr.  How much did Hope do?  She's amazing.  She is.  Yeah.  But this book is all about sex.  Fucking.  Like, boom.  Yeah.  Like, if you want to, like, play around when it comes to, like, real sex.  Yeah.  This is it. 
[04:00:00]  That's the one.  Yeah.  All right.  And she's doing a signing.  Tomorrow noon at the Big Barnes and Noble here on Fifth Avenue.  And I crumpled it up.  I want to say 46th Street.  But there will be a line.  Don't be an asshole and get there at 5 to 12 and expect to march up and hug Jenna.  Don't be a fucking fool.  Have you done any signings yet?  My first one.  Expectations high?  It should be huge.  I think so, too.  I saw, the last time I saw you at a signing was I was doing, uh, I was doing something 
[04:00:30]  for AVN in, like, 2007 and you were there.  Whatever it was.  It might have been your last time.  And just the line was fucking astronomical.  Insane, right?  Insane.  Yeah.  It was really, really wrapped around a few times.  When you're at a signing, just because of what you do for a living, and I don't know  what, uh, what you would take pride in or not, when somebody tells you that they  masturbate to you, is this a compliment?  You know, it's funny.  I was talking to my girlfriend about that.  Um, I don't really know what to say. 
[04:01:00]  I don't know what to, should I say thank you?  I would think so.  I mean, that's the mission, right?  Is to have guys jerking off to what you're doing, when you were doing that.  Like, thanks, baby.  Yeah, and that's great.  Then they'll go home and jerk off to you calling them baby.  Or be like, uh-huh?  Yeah, I didn't want the visual.  Yeah.  Or, no, if you're in public, if you're in a store or something, and they say that,  you should say, show me.  Yeah, yeah!  Let's see it, tough guy. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, right.  Prove it.  Yeah, I don't believe you.  I'm going to stick with thank you.  Yeah.  Or mention, or really creep them out, and mention the Lord in Scripture.  No guy wants to hear that.  No guy wants to hear that.  Yeah, while Jesus was watching, you did that.  Yeah.  Oh, yummy.  Yeah, I jerk off to you.  Well, according to Scripture, that's a sin.  Right.  Oh, boo.  Indeed.  Well, Jenna, thank you so much.  Thank you.  I'm happy you came.  Good luck with everything, and getting the kids back, and maintaining sobriety, and the  book, Sugar.  Thank you.  Everybody go out and buy it. 
[04:02:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, that's it.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
