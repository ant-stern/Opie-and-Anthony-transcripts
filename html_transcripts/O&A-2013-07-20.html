<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "worst of the week" countdown, beginning with a hilariously terrified reaction to clips from *The Conjuring*, featuring screams, visible fear, and discussions about showing the film to the staff.  This transitioned into a discussion of Jim Norton's movie date with two female interns, focusing on their reactions to the film and Norton's use of Roland Campos at Warner Brothers for movie screenings.  The show then heavily featured a discussion of the *TWA Flight 800* documentary, with filmmakers Tom Stalkup and Christina Borgeson as guests.  They debated theories surrounding the crash, examining eyewitness testimonies and inconsistencies in official reports from the NTSB, FBI, and CIA.

The countdown resumed with a clip featuring Robert Zimmerman (brother of George Zimmerman) and Jenny Hutt discussing the Trayvon Martin case, offering contrasting viewpoints. This was followed by a shocking audio clip of Bobo becoming sexually aroused while on the phone with a studio guest, Mary Jean, during a graphically explicit conversation detailing various sexual acts and preferences.  Other guests mentioned throughout this portion included Jeff Bridges, Bob Saget, Robert Zimmerman, Adam Carolla, and Joe DeRosa.

A phone call with Mary Jean dominated a later segment, with Opie, Anthony, and Bobo engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually graphic conversation.  This segment also included a surprise appearance by Bob Kelly, and later discussions of Bob Saget's appearance and an interview with Adam Carolla, punctuated by numerous advertisements.

Another segment started with a discussion about the lack of honest dialogue surrounding Alec Baldwin, using the "burning barn" metaphor.  This segued into a broader conversation about perceived hypocrisy and dishonest discourse in the country, using the George Zimmerman trial and another tragic death as examples.  In-studio guest Joe DeRosa became the target of much ribbing over his poorly received tattoo, with the hosts and others offering humorous and vulgar critiques.  This segment also included an interview with Jeff Bridges, covering *King Kong*, remakes, his musical career, meditation, *The Dude and the Zen Master*, and his experiences with studio interference on *Arlington Road*.  Stacy Keebler's upcoming appearance was promoted, along with more commercial breaks.

A subsequent excerpt featured a more in-depth interview with Jeff Bridges, discussing the philosophical aspects of *The Big Lebowski*, his career (including *Fearless*, *Jagged Edge*, and his thoughts on projects that didn't succeed, like *The Amateurs*), his photography, and his aversion to modern technology.  Comedian Rich Voss joined, sharing a humorous anecdote about a gaffe on a Chris Rock movie set.  Voss discussed his stand-up career, dealing with hecklers, his book deal, and a recent tattoo, alongside his wife, Bonnie McFarlane. They discussed the line between funny and mean in comedy.  A call from Joe DeRosa, with a poor connection, detailed his frustrations with a Philadelphia radio station's refusal to have him on.  The conversation circled back to the challenges of the entertainment industry.

The show concluded with a series of advertisements interspersed with a conversation about comedians who have faded from the spotlight.  The hosts reflected on the challenges and potential burnout within the comedy world, expressing empathy and curiosity towards these individuals.  The advertised products included Dish Network's Hopper DVR, Goldsmith's golf clearance sale, Adam & Eve adult products, Admiral Leasing, California Coast University, SiriusXM, Tennessee lakefront property, Healthy Man Viagra, Orlando lakefront condos, BG's ethanol fuel system defender, and SmartMouth mouthwash.

[00:05:30]  dude  that's that shit  they fucking do it right  when you get people that can make a movie like that  and do it right like that  you don't know where it's coming from  you spend the whole movie going  because you don't know  yeah  oh  is that scary  i think there's some down time  where it's just some nice dialogue  but then you don't know  of like the next second  so you can't ever  is there another great groovy 60s song in there  that's like uh 
[00:06:00]  like paranormal activity  when there's just conversations going on in the kitchen  and you're just sitting there  waiting for all the kitchen drawers to open  and you know it's coming  you're not even listening to the conversation  you're just looking around like  alright where's the cover find  yes  see the thing um  the funny part is like  they'll  cut  alright we gotta redo that  there was a problem with the match  so whoever's hands they were  is like i'm gonna run to craft services  and grab a fucking uh  i know  i'm gonna grab a turkey sandwich  with the clapping in the dark hands 
[00:06:30]  those hands were holding  were wiping an asshole an hour before  the wars of the week  come true  on the opian anthony channel  i've never seen kenny watch a horror movie  because that's kenny's kryptonite  this big tough fucking monster  doesn't like horror movies  what's up with you and horror films  there's they're not necessary  i'm a pussy  i don't search them out myself  but yeah i'm not  but i don't walk around life  like a like you  like a huge monster  yeah i don't want  the gory horror scary movie 
[00:07:00]  was it gory jimmy  jimmy went and saw the conjuring  i went and saw it  i was not alone  i had the company of uh  of two young ladies  really  wow  a couple of young ladies  did you finally get to go to lunch  uh we did go to lunch  yes we did  yes we did  that's all jim norton wants  is to go to lunch  he hasn't been able to find  not one lady to go to lunch  it wasn't quite  a romantic interlude  no why not  well  who are these young ladies  young ladies might be interns 
[00:07:30]  at a certain radio company  come on  sam why  do you have a problem with this  i never got a lunch  and a movie screening  when i was an intern  but you got a job out of it  what you're saying  these girls don't have a shot at that  no of course not  why  but they're perfect at what they do  what upping the mood  yes  they've made this place a very very happy place  are they are they here today  oh yeah 
[00:08:00]  can i  it was  how did it  how did it come about that you went to the movie with the two interns jim norton  i was honestly going by myself  and roland just told me  during the  i was at the gym and he texted me and he said oh yeah the interns are going too  we didn't arrange it that way  it was literally just the way it worked out  yeah  and uh  here they come  yeah i didn't get to share a fancy meal with a celebrity like jim norton until years after i was working here  yes but you got to share many with me  now we've shared many  yes  yeah maybe they should just do the whole show with us today 
[00:08:30]  what  by the way  this shows you how comfortable the interns are  instead of both taking the one mic  fucking sydney's in anthony's chair  they just spread out  put his headphones on sydney  yeah why not  what are you doing you're here  am i right  sydney knows you  what are they gonna do yell at me  i'll just sit down in the amp seat  how do these buttons work  how jackie sits in front of a mic  jackie's ready  you're ready to broadcast aren't you  they're both very comfortable  yeah  so did jim norton give you the  invite or was it 
[00:09:00]  one of these things where you guys all just happened to go  roland invited us  but by the time  when me and sydney got there  our names weren't even on the list  so we just  we just dropped roland's name and said he invited us  oh really  yeah  mine wasn't either  it was all under roland  the guy goes  i came alone  and he goes  who at warner brothers do you know  i'm like the roland campos  but it works  it did work  i don't understand how all that works with him  i don't understand how you've been in show business this long  and your contact at warner brothers is 
[00:09:30]  roland campos  humiliating  you knew the guy wouldn't know me  but he was happy that some people from the show came though  yeah  the guy from warner brothers  um  he doesn't listen to the show  he's an old you know  but he's like what do you do  i'm like oh you know we're on the air  and he goes oh wow  thanks so much  he was really nice  they were very nice there  very cool  and they treated  well we're gonna sell some tickets i think for this movie  why because the interns went  yes  it's ridiculous  we were the only ones who screamed  yeah  in the entire movie  we're the only ones  we're the entire movie  you're kind of giving away the punchline 
[00:10:00]  because that's what jimmy told me  he said you two were the only ones  screaming  and then we'd laugh after  because we were the only ones  why wasn't anyone else screaming  it was  how many people were there  25, 30, maybe 40  yeah  was it a tiny  one of those tiny screenings  those things rule  you know why nobody else was screaming  because they're all media people  that didn't bring their cute female interns  that's why nobody was screaming  because jeffrey lines doesn't have a little  20 year old intern to bring with him  no but i was  they are the ones  like that reaction that they were giving the movie 
[00:10:30]  it's like the movie company  would spit on every other person  in that room  those are the  you're the ones that they wanted  do you really need a notepad  for a horror movie  yeah just writing  this shot didn't work for me  yeah  they're just writing notes  about a horror movie  maybe some  you know  drama  that's a little complicated  but not a horror movie  that's a  that's like a fucking carnival ride  yeah  just go with it  there was certain uh  it was pretty scary  i mean honestly  the trailer was horrifying 
[00:11:00]  yeah  and don't watch the trailer  right before you go  because it shows you a lot of the scary things  but even with that  it's still a lot of it  fuck  every time they screamed  like  i felt  i literally felt like water was thrown on me  like  not  not annoyance  but i was  equally frightened of what i was seeing  i just don't scream during horror movies  i just kind of cave into myself  and go  he did  he was leaning towards the other side  like in a little ball  i was fucking  there were a couple of parts of it  that were truly horrifying  was it a bit of a turn on 
[00:11:30]  that they were screaming  no  but it was  it was funny to me  i'm used to hearing that sound  believe me  but it was fun to watch  i realized  like i haven't watched a horror movie  with screaming girls  in  maybe my whole life  never sat in a theater  with two screaming girls  watching  it was fun  right  that's the way you're supposed to enjoy the movie  the guy in front of us did not find it fun  no  why  he was pissed off that you were screaming at a horror movie  yeah he shushed us  yeah  i shushed him back  who was it 
[00:12:00]  he was some guy writing  he was like in the aisle seat  like a big sweaty neck  it was terrible  down his neck  and now he was in the row in front of us  and i guess they screamed at something  but he didn't shush the scream  it was after  because then all of a sudden  jackie turned into a fucking  a black movie patron  and she's like  why is she doing that  it wasn't even that loud  in his screaming room  yeah  not in a movie theater  yeah  it was like  it was like going on 125th street  and she starts  what is he going that way  but then the guy was like  shush 
[00:12:30]  and she shushed him back  I hate to admit it  but i almost see it the other way  with the guy  yeah  you're signing with the guy  well because these screening rooms  are very serious  of course  the whole reason to go to a screening room  is because you're like  you're watching the movie in peace  so you can review it  well they only invite people  to the screening room  that really can sell tickets for them  or write a nice review  or whatever  so  it's all media people  right  and then it's two interns  that are like  wow free movie  yay  where's the popcorn  what do you mean  they don't have popcorn  no notepads 
[00:13:00]  they just walk in  no it was good  I thought it was really good  it was scary  just facebooking the whole time  yeah  so they have something over there  their people  look I got to see  the conjuring  Nicki Minaj  ringtone  goes off  yeah  I kind of see it  the other way  we didn't use our phones  at all though  in my eyes  these interns  can't do no wrong  but I don't know  I almost understand  the shh  the shushing 
[00:13:30]  we did eavesdrop  on that guy  yeah  in the beginning  he wanted to be an actor  I mean he was talking  to himself  during this conversation  so me and Sidney  just kind of listened  what do you mean  he was talking to himself  his overall goal  was to be like  not a starring actor  and he knew that  yeah  he knew going into it  who was he talking to  himself  he was just kind of like  you know I'm here  and I don't know  if he's talking to the guy  in front of him  but he was kind of just  projecting  it doesn't matter  who he was talking to  was he talking to  like a  device  no  no  no  I almost said 
[00:14:00]  tape recorder  thank god  and now I did  now I did  I know that's why  I stopped  I'm like  they don't know  what a tape recorder is  Jesus  a device  thank you  I gotta update that  I always say  tape recorder  and what do you want  to be a character actor  I don't know  he just said  he's like  I knew from the beginning  I would never be a star  but you know  you could tell  he really wanted  to be a star  who was he talking to  I don't know  he really wasn't  talking to anything  he really wasn't  talking to anybody  holy  he was like  reading the pamphlet 
[00:14:30]  they gave you  and kind of just like  oh look at this guy  I could have been him  yeah that's what it was  went on with the conversation  weird  creepy  so I don't really care  that he shushed me  how was Jimmy  during the conjuring  I was upset  he didn't scream at all  I mean he got  he looked  he looked scared  I was frightened  I had to be macho though  you know  obviously  just in case  in case the gals  sold him  get him out of there  yeah yeah yeah  I had to know  they were safe  except for one part  you did scream  did I make a noise  on top of the 
[00:15:00]  oh yeah yeah  I didn't even mean  I mean to do it  what kind of noise  was it  it wasn't really a scream  it was just like  like a gasp  I did gasp  there was a couple  that really  there was a few  horrifying moments  and the people  in front of us  there was a  there was a  guy against the wall  because we were  like six seats deep  and he had a woman  with him  and she didn't scream  but she was  cowering against him  people were frightened  man  there was some  terrifying moments  in that film  you guys like it 
[00:15:30]  oh yeah  it was really scary  but it was good  you like scary movies  no  I hate them  no  no me neither  the last one I saw  was the first  paranormal activity  and I didn't want  to go see a scary  movie after that  I like them  I'm awful with scary  movies  I like the scream  movies actually  yeah those are those  like kind of  teeny bopper  horror movies  yeah I like that  I do too  I enjoyed that  for some reason  but I don't  I haven't seen  The Ring  any of those  that was scary  the first time  I saw The Ring 
[00:16:00]  I was alone  Keith Robinson  got me a copy  of it  and I watched  it in my old  apartment by myself  that's when we were  off the air  and I was so  fucking freaked out  I had to like  leave the lights  on in my apartment  that was the last  leave your lights  on movie  I just lived in my  sister's bed  for like a week  I was terrified  it was frightening  TV had to leave  the room  it was all  going to pop on  on me  The Conjuring  got to all of us  because we watched  the trailer yesterday  right before I went  to bed last night  I actually prayed  that I wouldn't  have weird  fucking dreams 
[00:16:30]  about The Conjuring  just based on  the trailer  yeah I said  to myself  please no  don't wake me  up in the middle  of the night  where I thought  I saw or heard  something  not tonight  that's when you  know that it's  like a good  I was a little  fucking nervous  that I would  have those weird  dreams about  you know  what I saw  it's a good  scary movie  it's like you  go and see it  and then you  go about the rest  of your day  and forget about it  and then when you  go to sleep  like the movie  starts creeping  back into your  head  and you're like  oh my god  I forgot about it  all day  and then Sydney 
[00:17:00]  goes oh yeah  I just remembered  I'm like oh god  now I'm scared  right before bed  I'm screwed  it's gonna attack me  are you guys  good friends now  yeah we tweet  you'll be friends  after this experience  I would say so  I mean she's in  Florida though  and I'll be in  New York  that's a no  from Jackie  no I'm just not  gonna fly in Florida  Sydney's all like  yeah I think so  yeah I'd love to  but you know  there's a great  distance between  yeah this day and age  that's sense  you just can't  figure out how to  you know  keep in touch  lines of communication 
[00:17:30]  get broken  yeah that's how it is  when I was growing up  you had to write a letter  now you can just  fucking text each other  I know  doesn't matter where  you fucking live  Jackie  absolutely  Skype  right  what got me  was my ex and I  had been texting  so I told her about  the movie  and how scary it was  and then before I went to bed  I looked at a text  that she had sent  and it was something about  oh it was so scary  and I'm like  and I had to think of it again  and it was  it's like weird  I get up to pee  where I'm like  I know I can't be  uncomfortable  because I'm 44 years old 
[00:18:00]  but I still  was like  you know  like it's almost like  you're talking shit to yourself  right  as you're going  like what is our fucking  ghost here  like that aggressive  conversation you have  but you're really frightened  but you couldn't even tell  yourself it wasn't real  because the movie  was based on a true story  so you're like  well then what am I  supposed to do  this is real  well I think Hollywood  came up with that shit  just to make  you know  the people going to the movie  more scared  I bet you it's loosely  based on a true story  you know what I mean 
[00:18:30]  I'm going to read up on that  as soon as you see  across the screen  based on a true story  it freaks you out  even more  well they  I don't even think  that popped up  in the beginning  it was the whole paragraph  oh did I  yeah it was a paragraph  about that  oh see you weren't  paying attention  I'm not going to read  the words  yeah it was reading  I didn't want to read that  stupid words  until the monsters pop out  I think it was like  a whole book  before it even started  because you're in  a special screening  so when you talk  about the movie  you know what  you're talking about  the worst of the week 
[00:19:00]  countdown  on the Opie and Anthony  channel  counting down  all the great moments  that happened this week  on the Opie and Anthony  show  it's the worst of the week  countdown with me  Sam Roberts  still to come  on this very countdown  Jeff Bridges  Bob Saget  Robert Zimmerman  Adam Carolla  all in studio  Bobo trying to get off  Joe DeRosa  and his bad tattoo  before I can get to  any of that  what I want to play  for you is  a conspiracy theory 
[00:19:30]  you know  Ant and Jim  specifically  have gotten  very  discerning  about how they look  at conspiracy theories  at one point  Jim believed  in the JFK  conspiracy theory  he believed  in the 9-11  conspiracy theory  he doesn't believe  in them anymore  because he's looking  at them  and realized  that to him  the most logical  explanation  the truth  is probably  you know  the reported truth  is probably  what the truth  was  but this  TWA  Flight 800 
[00:20:00]  conspiracy  has Anthony  and Jim  questioning things  that was a lot  because of a documentary  that premiered  this week  on epics  and epicshd.com  we talked  to the people  responsible  for that documentary  fascinating stuff  here  on the worst  of the week  countdown  a new documentary  called  TWA  Flight 800  and we got  Tom Stalkup 
[00:20:30]  and Christina  Borgeson  Borgeson  yes  I think that's  hey sir  they're outside  the studio  just kind of  having coffee  they're just  kind of  here they come  bring them right  in here  hello  welcome  hi guys  welcome to the show  hello  a couple of seats  right over there  how you doing  get yourself  comfy  alright  alright  so you  allege  whack us  with your best  show  no 
[00:21:00]  no  I am  one of the  consummate  skeptics  of everything  deemed  conspiracy  or anything  so I went  into this  looking like  oh boy  what is this  loose change  and every other  you know  hair brain  kind of  conspiracy  thing  and  immediately  I was like  oh  well  and then  what do we  got here  very very  compelling  and  very well  done  this wasn't  like 
[00:21:30]  and we  spoke to  this  mysterious  guy  these were  people  that were  professionals  in the  industry  investigators  people that  worked for  the airline  NTSB  and  just an  amazing job  really  loved it  thank you  thanks  yeah  Hank Hughes  was the  NTSB  investigator  who actually  laid out the  reconstruction grid  for the aircraft  and he  rebuilt the  interior  he rebuilt the  entire interior  he's in charge  of that  but he was not  allowed to write  an analysis  of his work 
[00:22:00]  yeah  I found that  odd  they could  submit  what they  found  like a  computer  that gathers  information  but doesn't  collate the  information  and then  you have  to give  that off  to the  feds  I gather  where they  then  determined  what happened  they then  put it  in a file  oh really  do not  open  no they  passed it  around to  the CAA  yeah  yeah  and typically  they would  be allowed  to write  an analysis  for what  they saw  yes  this is  unprecedented  everybody  remember  the medical 
[00:22:30]  examiner  also said  he wasn't  allowed to  write an  analysis  the medical  examiner  yeah  so generally  what you  do is  and that's  what happened  nobody wrote  an analysis  none of  these groups  that were  part of  the investigation  wrote an  analysis  well at  least the  ones we  spoke to  we didn't  speak to  there may  have been  some but  at least  the ones  we spoke  to  is that  common  I don't  know  well that's  true  is that  common though  that they  are not  allowed  it's  unprecedented  it is  unprecedented  I need  to  put that  on the  record  that's  strange 
[00:23:00]  the analysis  is what  tells you  what the  information  and then  everybody's  analyses  are supposed  to come  together  and form  a picture  of what  happened  and this  is unprecedented  that they  weren't allowed  to write  it up  that's so  weird  the official  manner of  death has  never been  finalized  by the  medical  and we're  finding this  out now  many years  later  it took us  a while  you know  no you guys  found out  how many  years ago  well about  that particular  thing during  this documentary  that's what I'm  saying  yeah  yeah  wow  that's crazy  the question  everybody asks 
[00:23:30]  is the main  question  and I know  you may not  have the answer  because the  documentary was  amazing  and I also  I hate  conspiracy shit  I'm like  right  but this  really roped  me in  and it made  me see  things very  differently  with this  along the  same way  yeah it's  hard to  but when  eyewitnesses  are saying  they saw  something  that they're  credible  it's kind  of hard  to  the question  I have  is why  would they  cover it  up  what is  the motive  behind it  what is  the  who wins  in that  because  TWA  went bankrupt  after that  didn't they  yes  I mean  that's one  of the reasons  why we're  filing this 
[00:24:00]  petition  you know  because we  want them  not only  to review  what they  did that  was wrong  and review  forensic  evidence  properly  but we  want them  to tell  us who  did it  yeah  and we  can't really  speculate  in our  position  because if  we do  that's when  we get  nailed  that's when  we get  looped  placed in  those other  categories  of conspiracy  right  because we  can't speculate  if we do  we'll get  and with that  why hasn't  anyone come  forward to  claim  responsibility  again that's  one of those  questions 
[00:24:30]  there are many  possibilities  what may have  caused this  right  and I just  can't even  say which  there are two  kind of  possibilities  here  which are the  two again  for the people  out there  well I think  the two most  obvious we say  was a proximity  fused missile  well the two  is probably  going to be  the most likely  would be either  terrorist or a  military exercise  wrong or some  kind of test  gone wrong  right  and we're not  going to say  which one we  believe is more  strong  I mean it  seems like a  test goes  wrong  seems like  like it's  the one  because a  group would 
[00:25:00]  have claimed  responsibility  why blow  up an  airliner  and then  not talk  about it  unless again  speculating  purely speculating  maybe it was  somebody in the  military who  was sympathetic  to Iran  did he go rogue  yeah  he went rogue  okay now you're  getting grassy  I am  didn't the US  shoot down an  Iranian passenger  plane by mistake  over the ocean  over the Persian  Gulf  yeah  so it's like  and then one of  ours is shot  down a passenger  plane it could be  completely unconnected  maybe I'm just  making noises right  now  my mouth 
[00:25:30]  you like the  grassy knoll  have you ever  been to Dallas  have you checked  that area  I have not  checked out  the grassy knoll  it's a great  afternoon  we've been there  yeah  you did  oh my god  you gotta do it  we were there  for hours  and then you  stand on the  X where it  happened and  take your picture  and all that  fun stuff  yeah  I can't believe  you haven't been  there  but they're not  conspiracy people  thank you  thank you  put Steely Plaza  and it's a big  event  it's just a good  thing to go  do  this is 
[00:26:00]  like I said  I went into it  like I just  it's gonna  it's gonna be  infuriate me  and it infuriated  me but in a  different way  I was like  wow  this  there really  are some  a lot of  loose ends  on this one  why didn't  the NTSB  have this  investigation  like it would  if they're  claiming it was  some kind of  mechanical problem  a wiring problem  why such  involvement with  the FBI  and even the CIA  instead of just  the NTSB  well the CIA  there was just 
[00:26:30]  no reason  that's another  unprecedented thing  I can understand  if perhaps  they knew  it was terrorism  and it's a crime  scene and you  want the FBI  and maybe even  the CIA  if there are  some things  going on  but since  they discounted  it to just  mechanical failure  how do they  then justify  them being  so involved  well the CIA  actually in the  very beginning  they wanted to  see if this  was a terrorist  missile  so the CIA  are the experts  of foreign  missiles and things  in the very  beginning  that was okay  which makes  sense  but then  they started 
[00:27:00]  producing a video  of what the  eyewitnesses saw  and that's what  was wrong  because they  never interviewed  a single  eyewitness  and they said  this was not  a missile  yeah they wanted  to show what  the people  didn't see  and they never  talked to the  people  and by the way  through a lawsuit  he got a bunch  of documents  CIA documents  and again  it was the same  thing  they gathered  all this  information  okay  but the  analysis part  that was all  redacted  jeez  isn't it amazing 
[00:27:30]  that you have  to sue  to get this  information  too  why is this  if it's just  a plane crash  or an explosion  of the center  fuel tank  why is that  protected  so much  is put under  the guise  of national  security  these days  and it's not  it's not  national security  but they can  say well  this will show  how we obtain  this and that  and it's 20  degrees separation  to national  security  so they  could just  black it  out  it's amazing  what's covered  under that  now  well  it's also  very interesting  it's not  in the documentary 
[00:28:00]  is there  was a video  of a missile  five days  before the crash  over long  island  really  the defense  intelligence  agency  confirmed  that there  was a missile  on the videotape  it was an  aircraft  or an AC  mechanic  on top  of the roof  of a hospital  filming the  sunrise  and the missile  went up  hey look  at the rocket  wow  and he brought  it to the FBI  after this crash  saying hey  is this significant  they made 10  copies  we requested  those copies  they lost  them  the dog  ate their homework  they certainly  did lose  a lot of stuff  did they lose  all those copies  oh my god  of course  they didn't lose 
[00:28:30]  that's what  they were actually  saying  yes they told me  look where they're  supposed to be  they couldn't  find them  where's the original  I contacted  the guy  finally found  the guy  and they're  very leery  I spoke to  his wife  and I'm not  even going to  mention his name  because he's  so leery  about being  involved  not that he  doesn't believe  this he does  he actually  his wife says  she doesn't  say anything  but the silence  is deafening  on the phone  but he believes  even in his FBI  document that it  was a rocket  or a missile  and he's in  Arizona right now  you know  that's one of the  interesting things 
[00:29:00]  about pursuing  this story  is how many  frightened people  there are  surrounding the story  when we were  trying to get  experts  you know  engineers  who are experts  in determining  the signature  of exploded  missiles  on airplanes  yeah  I mean  we literally  called  all over  the world  and the minute  people figured  out  what this  was pertaining  to  they said  I can't  talk about  that  I said  why  no I can't  answer that 
[00:29:30]  let me just  send you this  no then you  can say  you sent  it to me  wow  yeah  they wouldn't  let me send  them an email  you know  it's part of  the fear  you think  though  like in  this day  and age  if you're  linked  with conspiracy  and again  because so  many like  fucking crackpots  have made  like a legitimate  investigation  seem like  conspiracy  they might  be afraid  of having  their name  tied in  like oh  great  now  it's almost  like if you  work in  science  if you're  a part  of SETI  then people  think you're  crazy  because you're  looking for  aliens  maybe they're  afraid of  being lumped  in with  what's  considered  a conspiracy  well actually  one guy  told us  that he 
[00:30:00]  had  connections  to and  contracts  with the  Pentagon  don't want  to lose  those  exactly  so I  mean  but  think about  it  think about  the implications  for this  country  that you  can't get  to the bottom  of something  like this  where 230  civilians die  right  you know  and then  it takes  us  17 years  just to get 
[00:30:30]  to where  we are  I mean  this is not  the only story  out there  like this  and so  what does  that say  it would  unless  unless it  was some  type of  cover up  for a  military  accident  I would  like to  like Jim  said  know what  the end  game  was  for this  whole  thing  like  why  wouldn't  you  attribute  it  to  terrorism  unless  maybe  I guess  you don't  want to  seem like  you're  vulnerable  but  someone  would  claim  responsibility  it seems 
[00:31:00]  like the  only real  end game  here is  to protect  like  oops  we made  a mistake  don't want  anybody  to know  but then  I also  heard  about that  like  how could  you keep  that many  people  quiet  is usually  the thing  and there  would be  a guy  on the  ship  if it  was a  ship  launch  missile  that would  be like  you know  yeah  I heard  a missile  go off  at that  hour  you can't  you can't  keep an  entire  ship  quiet  so  you know  any  well  you know  it's interesting  that you  say that  because  look at  the marginalization  of the  eyewitnesses 
[00:31:30]  you saw  that part  in the  film  where  I  I asked  the  FBI agent  I said  you know  you're telling  us this is  mass  misperception  all these  people  up and  down  the coast  that's  ridiculous  mass  misperception  who didn't  even know  each other  you know  they all  say the  same  thing  and  you're  just  shunting  them  aside  and  that  has  survived  that  mass  misperception  concept  has  survived  I mean  we're  fighting  obviously  against it  but think  about that  for a  minute  if you  can do 
[00:32:00]  that  to  more than  600  eyewitnesses  in this  case  think about  it  it's kind  of terrifying  and they  cite this  case to say  oh look how  eyewitnesses  can be wrong  so now  eyewitnesses  have no  sometimes  they do  get things  wrong  I'm not  saying that  but when  you have  amazing  consistency  when you  have a  mass  of  eyewitnesses  it's just  like  you know  what I find  interesting  is I  don't know  if you  guys  I watch  you know  48 hours  I've worked  with DEA  agents  I've worked  with detectives 
[00:32:30]  you know  and they'll  tell you  when they  get onto  a crime  scene  what's the  first thing  you do  did anybody  see you  you talk  you talk  to potential  witnesses  and those  witnesses  go to  court  people are  sent to  jail  based on  eyewitness  testimony  and here  we have  more than  90 eyewitnesses  all up and  down the  coast  who saw  the event  from start  to finish  and the event  was they  feel like  they saw  a flare  or some  of them  called it  a missile  a lot 
[00:33:00]  of them  called it  a rocket  you know  and didn't  they say  it went  up unevenly  almost  there was  a really  weird pattern  they said  that it  went up  almost like  something  many of  them who  didn't know  each other  didn't actually  talk to each  other  said it  went up  from the  surface  first of  all  the plane  was at  10 minutes  into its  flight to  Paris  it was way  up there  2.6  miles  13,800  feet  and went  up  and many  many people  say  then it  turned left  as if it  was heading  towards  something else  and it  turned left  the last  second  and boom  and so  that's  yeah  that's  what they 
[00:33:30]  say  and they're  all saying  that  the pilot  you guys  had on  was very  convincing  because he  was up  at what  2,000 feet  5,000  maybe  5,000  and he  saw it  go past  him  from below  him  to  the ground  passes  altitude  yeah  that's a  difficult  one  to write  off  yeah  right  there  is  evidence  you have  to look  at  what I  call  the  moving  target  rationale  which  is  you know  there  were  explosives  all  over  the  residue  all  over  the  plane  inside  and out  and 
[00:34:00]  first  they  tell  you  oh  it  was  a  dog  sniffing  exercise  there  were  only  three  positive  hits  actually  and  that  was  because  of a  dog  training  exercise  and  we  blew  that  out  of  the  water  because  when  that  dog  training  exercise  was  allegedly  occurring  on the  plane  the crew  was already  on that  plane  and the  guy  said  he  was  on  an  empty  plane  so  that's  been  blown  out  and  they  would  put  he  spilled  some  and  the  guy  we  talked  to  he  said  no  we 
[00:34:30]  didn't  spill  any  but  we  proved  that  the  crew  was  already  on  board  by the  time  the  guy  finished  the  timeline  never  worked  out  the  timeline  so  then  they  move  it  they  say  well  the  machines  the  machines  the  aegis  explosive  detective  machine  gives  frequent  false  positives  so  then  we  talk  to  the  inventor  we  talk  to  the  inventor  we  we  also  talked  to  the  super  the  lab  one  of  the  lab  supervisors  at  the  time 
[00:35:00]  who  says  oh  no  it  was  very  so  then  they  move  it  again  and  they  well  then  they  just  a couple  weeks  ago  they  said  it  dissolves  in  water  and  it  doesn't  it's  insoluble  in  water  these  explosives  so  it  keeps  evolving  with  their  to  keep  the  story  how  they  want  it  it  just  seems  very  odd  because  I  bought  the  story  I  bought  the  official  story  because  of  the  official 
[00:35:30]  source  reporting  that's  what  it  is  because  what  happens  is  when  Jim  Kallstrom  the head  of the  FBI  investigation  he gets  on  TV  and he  goes  it  wasn't  a  missile  it's  not  a  missile  and he  presents  the  CIA  animation  everybody  just  writes  oh  Kallstrom  said  it's  not  a  missile  no  one  says  is  Kallstrom  lying  nobody  checks  into  it  we  had  a  conversation  with  a  senior  producer  of  a  major  network  which  we  were  on  the  phone  with  this  guy  because  he 
[00:36:00]  produced  a  documentary  full  of  inaccuracies  that  they  keep  airing  and  we  said  to  him  I  finally  said  to  him  I  said  listen  I  said  when  you  interview  Jim  Kallstrom  or  Jim  Hall  the  chairman  at the  time  I  said  don't  you  fact  check  what  they  say  and  I  swear  to  God  this  guy  said  and  his  boss  was  on  the  phone  too  he  said  that's  not  my  job  he  said  my  job  is  just  to  present  their  perspective  to  people  right

Continues  Moving right along  this is the  Worst of the Week  Countdown  highlighting all  the great moments  that happened on  the Opie and Anthony  show this week  with me  Sam Roberts  from Opie and Anthony  and after Opie and Anthony  Live  and the Sam Roberts  show and every place else  we got a lot to get to  still  as much as we've  already listened to  still Jeff Bridges 
[00:41:30]  and Bob Saget  and Adam Carolla  all in studio  Bobo is going to  try to get himself off  that really happened  but before any of that  I want to play for you  Robert Zimmerman  in studio  now this was  only  maybe 48 hours  after the verdict  of not guilty  had been placed  on his brother  George Zimmerman  in the Trayvon Martin  shooting  he was found  not guilty  of manslaughter  and of murder too  Robert Zimmerman  came in  he talked about  the case  he talked about 
[00:42:00]  how his brother  was doing  he talked about  what they were doing  and we got  Jenny Hutt  on the phone  Jenny Hutt  she works here  at SiriusXM  and is now  Dr. Drew's  co-host person  on HLN  she's been talking  about this case  the entire time  it was on  directly contradicting  a lot of what  Anthony was saying  so it was very  interesting  to have her  and Robert Zimmerman  on at the same time  that's why  we figured we'd  play it again  on the weekend  this is it  Robert Zimmerman  and Jenny Hutt  on the countdown  number six 
[00:42:30]  we got Jenny Hutt  on the line  Jenny  Jenny  we got George's  brother Robert Zimmerman  in studio  and we figured  we figured you'd owe  the whole family  an apology  so we'll start here  go  oh I don't believe  anyway  what anyway  you and Dr. Drew  I owe anybody  an apology  I think that I  have to  leave the verdict 
[00:43:00]  as is  because that's  the verdict  and that's really  that's really  how it ends  you were saying  things like  well  I think  George  killed  an innocent  boy  without putting  anything in context  hold on  I do  I do still  I do still  feel uncomfortable  about the whole thing  that said  as I  I don't think  anyone's comfortable  with the whole thing  that we have  to respect  the verdict  I do think  that the prosecution  did not present 
[00:43:30]  an adequate case  and therefore  George Zimmerman  was found  do you think  they didn't present  an adequate case  because they didn't  have an adequate case  there's a big difference  I think we'll never  really know  exactly what happened  because Trayvon Martin's  dead  well Jenny  let me ask you  what do you think  and I have to  and I've argued  with Anthony  about this  and I've taken up  in a way  for the prosecution's side  but  what do you think  they could have said  that they didn't  I don't think  that they just  didn't have the evidence  well I think  it was beyond  they're not having  listen  I think 
[00:44:00]  if you believe  George Zimmerman's  account  then I think  not guilty  was the right answer  but it also jives  with the evidence  that's just  just that  when people go  oh it's only his word  against the dead guy  it's like no  it has to jive  with the evidence also  yeah but in truth  the evidence  the way the evidence  was presented  it was on the burden  of the prosecution  to present enough evidence  to convince a jury  beyond a reasonable doubt  that George Zimmerman  was guilty of murder  too  the only job  that the defense  had  was to prove  reasonable doubt 
[00:44:30]  and they went above  and beyond  and actually  proved innocence  it was an amazing job  by the defense  doing what the prosecution  normally does  they only needed  reasonable doubt  they proved  what happened  hey guys  the defense  did a terrific job  I'm not gonna  I will not  say here  or say on TV  that the defense  did anything  but a terrific job  for their client  but my position  remains that  it's a horrible tragedy  I feel incredibly sad  about the loss  of this young life  and I do think  that George Zimmerman  was somewhat 
[00:45:00]  quick to trigger  and that's how I feel  and  Jenny Robert  I'm sorry to interrupt  Robert has a question  for you though  Robert has a question  for you  Jenny I think  I think I met you  when I did  Dr. Drew  I'm just  I did  how are you  I'm curious about  you know  when people say  the burden of proof  is on the state  I get that  that's in every situation  but  do you think  that  this man  Chief Bill Lee  who has no job now  because  racism ruled the day  and him  and his entire department 
[00:45:30]  were smeared as racist  by Ben Crump  and do you think  that  Norm Wolfinger  who was  Ben Crump  wrote a letter  to the justice department  saying that he had  driven in the rain  to decide  and conspire  with the racist police chief  not to charge George  do you think  he wouldn't have  wanted his job  and every employee  who worked for him  and do you think  that the entire  federal  Florida Department  of Law Enforcement  was corrupt  and also conspiring  to  this is what I think  I don't  this is what I think  I believe it was  a valid prosecution 
[00:46:00]  I met your friend  Frank  a bunch of times  on the TV show  I don't  I don't believe  it was a malicious  prosecution  I believe  that  there's now  the Department  of Justice  making some  sort of inquiry  as to whether  there was a civil  rights  that'll never wash  never  listen  to me  I don't know  that it'll wash  either  however  that's still  going on  and there is  an aftermath  in this whole event  and in a way  I do have  look  I do have 
[00:46:30]  compassion  for your brother  in that  being  not being  incarcerated  he's not  going to have  much of a  free life  either  at this point  because  society  is somewhat  inflamed  but  it is what  it is  I mean  it's a hard  way you look  at it  I understand  all of that  and that's your  opinion  and that's great  but back to  the actual  question  the actual  question  is  all of these  people  who the only  thing they needed  to set an  arrest  in motion  for anything  was one  shred  or inkling 
[00:47:00]  of probable  cause  in any way  shape or form  and any one  of those  cops could have  gone to his  house and  arrested him  and the entire  police department  do you really  think that  every one  of those  people  was conspiring  to not arrest  George for  racist reasons  the way it  was presented  in the media  do you really  think that's  the reality  that Chief  Lee would  rather be  fired by  the city  council  that was  not something  that I  looked into  I really  only looked  at the  actual  surprise  surprise  that requires  looking into  something  the point 
[00:47:30]  here is  this never  should have  gone to  trial  in the  first place  this man's  life  never  I recognize  being on  your show  this morning  that there's  no way  that anyone  is going to  really care  about my  that's not  true  I think  I've been  back and  forth on this  whole thing  I'm trying to  hear both  sides  Mr. Norton  but yes  yes Jenny  Tim what do  you think  what aunt  what do you  think  I was  I kind of  had mixed  feelings about it  I didn't think  he deserved  murder too 
[00:48:00]  but I wasn't  comfortable with  him being  totally exonerated  either  I felt that  he pushed  this  but I know  that I'm  legally I don't  think  I don't think  the prosecution  I understand that  I don't think  the prosecution  dropped the ball  I don't think  the prosecution  missed something  I think the  defense did a  brilliant job  they hid the  ball  they hid  evidence  they hid  reports  in the phone  logs  they hid  the picture  of George  that they had  that proved  how he was  attacked  they never  asked  not even  in his bond  hearing  to see his  medical records  this is a  person making  statements to  police  my nose 
[00:48:30]  is broken  my doctor  will confirm  it  and a  prosecutor  doesn't even  bother  are they  going to pursue  sanctions  they talked  about sanctions  are they going  to go after  them  you know what  stay tuned  that's all I have  to say  Jenny do you have a  question for Robert  no I just was  going to say  what do you mean  it's George's  brother  any type of  question  what movie  did George watch  last night  now that he's  free  anything  is George

[01:14:30]  sounded like his fame pushed him that  way where he finally just kind of it did  people and he's not the guy that's like  hey hey good to see everybody right you  know yeah yeah because he was a guy that  used to be out and about when he was  younger yeah hollywood especially and  then like uh the that fame just made him  close down and kind of isolate himself but  he was so good at that gig right oh my  god and by the end he had basically no  friends and even his wife he you know  that he really loved the last one there he  distanced it but he lost his kid too so  that was a terrible yeah he won i think he  had said to uh to his wife or wife to be 
[01:15:00]  at one point he said i don't want to do  this these shows are all consuming joanna  yeah you just yeah you he knew what it was  to get into that show and if it was  successful he knew that would become his  life period that's right and that's  exactly what happened to the guy and he  wanted it i mean he loved doing it i  used to talk to him and he was really  really kind to me i mean i was talking  to him that was someone that i idolized  that i was god got over you talked to him  what backstage or yeah before the show  what kind of conversations that's huge 
[01:15:30]  really interesting stuff um but one time  it was uh i thought i was like bombing on  the air and i said hey i wasn't too good  he goes oh you were good they were they  were just they suck tonight and i went  well what do you what do you do and he  goes oh you just uh you got tomorrow  night it's always tomorrow and then um he  probably felt it in the monologue or  something and knew that they just weren't  a great crowd yeah you could tell right  away it was no different than what we do  sure you just know but um he was really  kind to me it's funny i would tell 
[01:16:00]  stories that didn't stop you know i was  like the nephew that would come on and  just tell stories you know so so i'm in  there with my uh my kids and he's like i  said this is true he goes i don't care  just tell it  he would have said tell the fucking story  and there was a music act i remember  talking to him i remember i have the  same memories kind of with letterman  years later would do that show a lot  also and and i'd known david from the  comedy store and stuff from years before 
[01:16:30]  but carson was that's an icon that i  never thought i'd ever be sitting and  talking right like like that how did it  feel to sit in that seat well it was  funny was i i kind of knew ed kind of  because he kind of knew my family in  philly and i first time i did it i  believe it was the first time i did it  was with gary shandling he was guest  hosting and then i did it again with  johnny and then i did it once with jay  and then i did total of 13 with johnny  i remember and then johnny was uh it was  two weeks before he was going off the  air and i brought him a watch uh as a 
[01:17:00]  joke and it said 30 years of great  service on it and i handed it to him  oh this is very nice thank you 30 years  of great service and then i took out 16  more watches identical watches like it  was just a piece of shit i gave one to  and then i thought i came on afternoons  give me my watch and i started jumping  on it and trying to break it and there  were thrown watches all over the place  like it was shit but he was uh that's  funny i took me out to his car once and  showed me his corvette yeah that's my  it's my new car he just he didn't seem 
[01:17:30]  that happy but he loved loved funny  people and that's what it looked like  and responded well because he knew that i  loved him and i didn't invade his privacy  i was just i would just listen to him  in the in the documentary they talk  about how uh somebody had mentioned  that watching someone be funny on the  show it was great because you got to  see a funny person but it was also  watching johnny legitimately laughing at  it made it even better and made it feel 
[01:18:00]  like like real you were in it you were  there laughing with somebody that you  cared about and just a weird that whole  time period and everything he was an  institution man that that just will  never there wasn't never be replaced  there wasn't that he was the guy yeah  no no explain how arsenio hall bit off  it a little bit took a little he did a  pretty amazing thing arsenio yeah  arsenio was a real competitor there for  a little bit but uh i want to talk about  the comedians again when he would call you  over everyone talks about the comic being 
[01:18:30]  called right right in his stand-up right  who are the who are the sad saps that  didn't get called over because now it's  obvious everyone knows about johnny  calling the comedian over if i really  liked them that's the whole big thing i  only yeah panel so i was really really  lucky oh you never did stand up on the  show they wouldn't put me on the  talent coordinator told me when i was  trying to get on for like 10 years i  couldn't get on when i finally had some  television of consequence then i would  come on as a guest just to talk to him  but they said my uh the the jim jim  mccauley who passed away he was a nice  man he was a talent coordinator said your  act is like a stone skipping on the 
[01:19:00]  water it doesn't quite dig in oh shit i i  want to do stand up i don't want a  pumpkin speech from i can kung fu i  don't fucking need that i just want to  get on the tonight show you brought your  cassette back to you and told you to go  out and get some nightclub work and do  some work and we'll send somebody out to  see you as soon as we can send us the  tape yeah do you have a link i'll wait  but your comedy is also you know it's  like edgier well it was it was it when  it was then it was just three 
[01:19:30]  associations so it didn't find it and  it still was edgy it was like my first  joke was uh i have the brain of a german  shepherd and the body of a 16 year old  boy and they're both in my car and i  want you to see them that was a joke  that's not a joke but you know this is  someone you say if you're fucked up right  and people would laugh at it kind of  because like what's wrong with this guy  yeah but uh yeah i love the documentary  and then it got into his relationship with  his mom who oh man apparently she  would have given him a little more  support just a little bit would have 
[01:20:00]  been nice she was uh yeah like just not  he wanted her to be proud of what he  did and and anybody you think would be  i mean what he achieved but even as a  even as he got older he just couldn't  get her approval or she'd i guess she was  watching the monologue with somebody that  was writing a story about time magazine  time magazine somebody you know a little  publication yeah yeah time magazine and  they're watching the monologue together the  writer and the mother and and done with  the monologue and she goes yeah she said 
[01:20:30]  that wasn't funny wasn't funny and  walked out of the room and walked out of  the room and it wasn't even like a joke  thing where she comes back then it goes  out right and the writers oh my god you  think she wanted to be famous frustrated  by that just an obvious narcissist but but  and not a person that understands anything i  mean that's ego battle well yeah yeah jealous  that your kid has maybe right yeah yeah it's  more complicated than that we were  discussing documentary yesterday thanks to  anthony brought to my attention i went right  home and got uh watched it uh when she 
[01:21:00]  died the mom she had a box in the closet  with all his shit all his press clipping she  saved everything so she so in a way johnny  carson was like oh okay maybe she can  express you know what she was feeling for  me in my career but in the end she did show  how proud she was because she saved it all  and then uh they said johnny took that box  put it in his closet and it remained there  until you know he died probably masturbated  to it oh god what about what about uh his  dad they didn't really go into the dad 
[01:21:30]  that much they didn't there was a good role  model positive guy it was very simple  stuff they said johnny i'm sorry this  footage of johnny from back in like the  40s and you know the early 40s doing  magic tricks around the house it's amazing  that people had some of the footage was  amazing watch him did they show the thing  with sammy davis jr and frank and at uh in  st louis they did an amazing show and  johnny was the emcee and he wasn't  killing i mean he was doing he was  young he hadn't i might have just started  to trust a game show and he was just a 
[01:22:00]  fresh spry good-looking guy that was  just like yeah they did yeah yeah he was  kind of awkward yeah the camera gangly and  likable yeah yeah but you wouldn't expect  him to become what he became yeah that  intersection doesn't happen where was he  from uh nebraska because they his father  really wasn't in that a lot but they said  something about like somebody from uh  the dad that he was he was the type of  guy from nebraska that uh loved his family  so much he almost told them jay leno said 
[01:22:30]  that it was the jay leno he loved his family  so much he almost told them he almost told  them  he loved his wife so much he almost told  them  that's what's sad is that people don't  right right i guess it's ethnicity too  because some i mean jewish italian  people maybe get a little more gregarious  and how much it's a cultural thing but  a person from the midwest doesn't go  around hugging their family no no that's  what sets people off the worst of the  week countdown by the way jim i was 
[01:23:00]  gonna say you beat me by half a second oh  my god that's right obviously he's actually  he named his shit after me i bet you it's  as tall as me  i bet more mass of his own body is coming  out of him what if he created an exact  opposite that just comes out of him  this twin his shit twin he shit his own  twin out i finally that's a great movie  you got something on that a lot of people  don't know this but he told me he's been  holding this since last night why that's 
[01:23:30]  what he does why does he hope well he  wasn't in labor till this morning yeah no  he does weird things like that he holds  his shit yeah we're gonna have to ask him  when he comes back well that's a problem  i don't know that's bad for you you can  get hemorrhoids you can get um you get  bowel cancer from holding shit it shows  you know what shit's got in it shit  you don't want to keep that in you  as soon as i get that feeling as soon as i get  that feeling it's time to get rid of it i love  getting rid of it fuck yeah it's fucking  awesome even people say don't do it on a 
[01:24:00]  plane but i'm so good at anything like i'm  yoga yoga's like helped me yeah i don't  even do yoga but plane you don't care at  home i i rehearse basically my yoga is  just in training for airplane shitting  squat squatting bob get it done with  quick yeah one of uh life's simple  pleasures is when you can't cut it loose  and you get a nice long one and it's  over huh oh you mean it just stays there  forever no i mean you think you're you're  you're snapping off logs but it turns out 
[01:24:30]  to be one nice real long one and then you  got a little amazement in your life for  the day well hold on i'm still caught on  you don't like this stuff anthony  anthony's trying to figure out if you like  the sensation of keeping it in there  oh no no no no no no i'm talking when  you're when it's a giant tube stick yeah  you're releasing but you know you're not  cutting off individual logs it becomes  one really long but see i can't relate to  this because you need to know as as he's  dropping logs he flushes immediately while 
[01:25:00]  he's still sitting on the toilet i have i do  that sometimes i like to see what i did  you know i like to look and make sure i'm  out there's no glass in it but yeah you  know like i ate rocks yeah jimmy what  happened you're smiling well i gotta be  honest um i've never experienced anything  like this that's not 20 minutes yeah i i take  slow shit but i i went upstairs i would  say not a great one it was one of those  ones where you know it's gonna be like i  felt like i was forcing out baby carrots 
[01:25:30]  covered in peanut butter oh jesus did you  eat either of those things pretty everything  turns to peanut butter i eat a lot of baby  carrots but you love the ones in the  package yeah that's what so that was it  orange yeah no no no i'm saying if they  were small and uh it was just hard to get  it all going and i'm like oh boy is wiping  gonna be a nightmare like you can be  nothing's worse than when your shit uh  sounds like you just threw pebbles in  the water yeah oh bag of rocks oh it's  the worst sounded like uh it sounded like 
[01:26:00]  you had soaked a golf ball in peanut  butter and you were rolling it down a  peanut butter gutter does that like  mousetrap what about my mother's old and  i probably shouldn't talk about this but  sometimes i'll take her to the restroom  somewhere and i'll drop her off and it's  like the act itself for an older person is  probably about 12 seconds tops but the  maintenance can be 45 minutes because  there's old flesh you have to get uh-huh is  that did you have a lot of wait wait wait 
[01:26:30]  you're putting a fanny pack did you  shit in that fanny pack hold on a second  you're giving us way too much material  have you had to wipe your mom's no i have  not not not uh i mean i do it  electively whether she needs it or not  yeah yeah i'm starting a website it's  wipe my mom's ass dot com i've been  able to dot net i have dot com i've been  able to avoid it but there are family  members that might have had to wipe my  mom's ass yeah my mom shits her pants

[01:36:00]  and anthony show this week and it sounded a little something like this  adam there he is how you doing man pleasure good to see you  take a seat right over there pull up a mic why not huh oh my god  la time huh yeah well then i did arty's show like i did i did caroline's last night right and then 
[01:36:30]  i went straight to arty's show oh man you're exhausted we left la you know got picked up at  5 30 so it was one of those how was arty crazy arty's great yeah arty's always oh yeah i mean  he just always brings it you know i'm seeing him tonight oh yeah we're doing a gig tomorrow  in pennsylvania with amy and david tell so uh i'm i'm fucking going on and you know we're plugging  together tonight yeah dave's coming i think dave's doing what doing caroline's tonight or maybe

[01:37:30]  you know i don't know i don't know what he was doing there i don't know what he's doing period  it's pretty funny to watch the self-destruction of a teen idol well also like these guys start  picking up tattoos yeah yeah pick them up pretty quick yeah and so you're 19 so like at 26 you're  going to be completely kind of no room no room for any more life experiences uh to put on your body 
[01:38:00]  right yeah very odd either that or he will uh just stop doing it it's really it's embarrassing  too because he's going through this you know you're 18 19 we're all kind of jizz buckets and  just to watch him humiliating himself and it's like it probably is something nobody would want  filmed by the whole fucking i was kind of a jizz boat a bag i wasn't yeah you had to squeeze me a  little bit yeah well it's not like you kicked me jizz would come out you'd have to put a little  pressure and then i would score it out but more jizz boat a bag well yeah i was more of a jizz bucket 
[01:38:30]  like if you just looked at me it was overflowing that's a good point drama you wouldn't want  everybody to look in on your fucking 18 19 year old thing you just maybe not a full jizz bucket but  we were pretty jizzy yeah uh back then speaking of uh jizz bucket and jim you know i met uh i met  your parents backstage at uh the borgata were you working with jay yeah oh god i wasn't i wasn't 
[01:39:00]  working with him jay's just such a mensch i was playing the borgata he was playing the borgata  he called me and just went yeah the borgata i said yeah he said you want to catch a ride  i said catch a ride to the airport like i'm such an idiot you know he's going to drive me to philly  he's going to drive me to philly tomorrow because i got a southwest flight back to la he said no we  leave tonight we drive to the airport tonight no you catch i got a plane you know it's like oh you got  a plane oh you're all right on your plane this is awesome nice he said he he flies in to atlantic 
[01:39:30]  city yeah from van nuys to atlantic city flies in that day gets in it gets in at 6 6 30 he doesn't  go to his room he just goes to his dressing room so he goes from the airport to his dressing room  like everyone else upstairs you know squeeze one off quit shower not in that order you know lay out  take a nap and then go do the show you know he goes right to his dressing room and he just he'll 
[01:40:00]  just hang out in his denim socks and denim contact lenses denim breathe right there's a denim breathe  right obviously you see him off and he'll sit there and he'll hang there for like you know an hour and  20 minutes eating a little fruit and then he'll go do a show then it's right back on the plane he never  goes upstairs wow he never goes to his room so he's mr showbiz yeah he said uh just come on over  just drop your stuff in my room and then when you're done with your show we'll just take off and i 
[01:40:30]  went to his room and he was standing there with your kindly elderly parents yeah and they're like  we're we're big fans and and and and they're out of a rockwell painting you're from the band rock  and they're like they're like i'm the whole time i want to go are you you know what your son  up to you know what he said you have any more than aware i think horrified yeah they are nice  normal you'd never know it i don't watch it anymore after ufc like i can't like guys like tyson all 
[01:41:00]  those guys that like excited you because they're who they were like i can't find any boxers i really  connect with me mayweather's the only one it's a little like once you discovered hardcore porn going  back to sort of skinamax like hey stockings right it's always some side boob i wonder if they're  really doing it yeah it's a little of that yes and then but any port in a storm you know but still  that you're looking for your next ufc fight do you watch them or no yeah you do okay so you're 
[01:41:30]  you don't understand what's going on it's really hard to get back into boxing i want to because  there's enough well you know what it is it's it's become a business for like i mean the thing  about boxing is the heavyweight division is the you know that's the jewel in the crown of boxing  and the heavyweight division has been dominated by two russian german guys who play chess and have  doctorates and they're they're in business to make money but not to lose brain cells right you know  back in the day these guys would just trade their business was getting hit and hitting other people 
[01:42:00]  you know joe frazier was going to go at it with jimmy pay or page or ellis jimmy ellis sorry  be a good one i've been hitting the head too jimmy ellis and guys like that and that's all they did  there's 15 knockdowns in the first four rounds you know if you if you see that like george foreman  and jimmy ellis and guys like that and now it's it's a business like literally the guy's like i need to  knock the guy out or just win the fight but i need not to get punched in the process and so they go out 
[01:42:30]  there with their condor like wingspans and their crazy technique and then also they don't the the  klitsch goes the nicest guys in the world but they don't have that street pride you know what i mean  like you hit me i'm gonna hit you harder you know it's like mitch blood green right and tyson going  after it's just lots of jabs lots of discipline and it makes for a super boring heavyweight fight right  yeah you want to see them just like windmilling each other yeah you want you want that you know bad 
[01:43:00]  blood yep this guy's you know on an online chess tournament later that night just got to keep  his wits about it just a gentleman a real gentleman yes yeah and so he's just up there staying out of  trouble technically winning but not putting on a good show for anybody and nobody's been able to get  near these guys for you know five years you know i watch you the night just to do i go sometimes i want  to watch these old boxing i watch fucking george foreman against ron lyle oh ron lyle yeah ron lyle was a 
[01:43:30]  guy did seven and a half years in a denver prison for like a murder or a fucking manslaughter  what black guy uh black guy black yeah i believe i had to reread it i couldn't believe it it's got  to be a misprint uh it was uh it was and i watched the stared out and i'm like what a tough  motherfucker and they said he wasn't afraid of form and he wasn't afraid of anybody no  and they were knocking each other down it was one of the greatest things you know my my thing it's  never going to happen but i don't get why it doesn't happen which the greatest thing ever 
[01:44:00]  would be if the two klitschko brothers came on one on the tonight show i went on jimmy kimmel live  i went on one of the one of the late night shows and they just sat there and they were promoting a  book you know that they're writing together and at some point jay or jimmy would go uh  would you ever fight each other you know and they go no my mom wouldn't you know and then well  but if you did who would win well i mean obviously i have a little more experience 
[01:44:30]  but you know we would never fight and then they start and it started to escalate and it started  to build where one of them got beat by cory sanders but the other one never lost to cory  sanders and then shirts start coming off and next you know they start pushing that would be a 200  million dollar pay-per-view yeah right it would and it'd be like look you guys are brothers but you  fight other people that are trying to kill you and you've both had 40 fights dial it down a little  get your 100 million dollar each on the pay-per-view and just go off into the sunset in there and because 
[01:45:00]  they would never fight each other that's the big deal but you'd fight i'd fight my mom for 80 grand  for fucking 50 i'd bite my mother's tits off for 50 million or 80 grand that uh that would be  interesting watching a couple of brothers beat the shit out of each other that isn't in a bar you know  that'd be the only thing that would rejuvenate the heavyweight division would be the clutch goes  heavyweights i know the names i haven't followed those oh the two giants and no one can beat them 
[01:45:30]  who's champion uh vladimir and the other guy won't be champion because he won't fight his brother he'll  fight whoever beats his brother if someone does i don't know there's vitalian there's vladimir and  i don't know if they're both champions or vladimir's the champ we'll figure it out but either way  they they almost never lose they're six foot eight and you know they're not into drugs i uh i gotta  i gotta talk to you about your uh your podcast and sure and uh as opposed to regular radio as they  call it um do you think you'd still be on the air on regular radio uh saying what you've been 
[01:46:00]  saying over the the past years because and it's nothing believe me but people deem it controversial  and crazy oh um yeah i don't know i you know i used to say a lot of fucked up things yeah yeah  on the air all the time and so i never you know i don't it's it's weird but we're kind of in a  different place now it's so fucking weird now i i know i but i don't think we're i don't think  people are more sensitive i think people are bigger douchebags and they just grab it first off 
[01:46:30]  there's a there's a couple of things it's a technology thing back when we used to do terrestrial  radio back in the day you'd say shit but someone would have to send a cassette to your program  director like listen minute hour three minute 18 21 seconds he makes a weird ching chong joke when  he's talking about chinese food i want you to review this but he'd never get to it and no one would 
[01:47:00]  ever figure it now there's a technology which is everyone grabs stuff everyone has their own  official page that looks like some kind of news page but it's just them and their shitty apartment  with a hot plate and they're banging it out on their mac but and it's like from world news and  and they do this thing and then they'll just you know adam carolla racist you know and then they  start throwing it out so a lot of it's just technological you couldn't grab these little bites right 
[01:47:30]  and send these files listen to what he said read the transcript email it to your friends you know  it didn't exist so now it's a a combination of everyone being super sensitive although they don't  give a shit no they're just trying to get you in trouble of course they're not even the group  whatever group you've offended they're not even in that fucking group they don't know anyone in that  group they never had sex with anyone in that group but they're trying it's this whole schadenfreude  thing we're like everyone's trying to get everyone into trouble did you hear oh i mean oh did you 
[01:48:00]  oh man uh did you hear what alec baldwin what the way he spoke to his daughter oh my god it's like  yeah really that's a that's a two and a half to anyone who's ever grown up with parents you know  or whose dad who got pissed off right that's nothing and then and then here's the thing then then  it's all over the news and all the pussy hypocrite cowards have to sit there and go and they look  that shocked look on their face like and when i heard that call i was shocked there's not one guy 
[01:48:30]  sitting in good morning america going i don't know what the big whoop is yeah my dad used to beat me  with a shoe yeah like now they just go oh my goodness feigned outrage it's righteous indignation  and then you get to be on the happy side of the issue you see you get to be on the good side of the  issue and whenever this stuff comes up whether it's trayvon martin trial or whatever the zimmerman  whatever and everyone just sits there and goes oh my god i don't know what to tell my kids and then 
[01:49:00]  and now you're on the happy side and meanwhile you're going we need to start a dialogue about i'm i'm  a huge pussy so i'm not going to say anything but someone should have a dialogue with some  there needs to be a national dialogue on alec baldwin they're not going to say anything that's not  towing the company line ever right but so and by the way they're just suggesting everybody it's  like it's like standing next to a burning barn going someone needs to put that barn out somebody's 
[01:49:30]  got to pick up a bucket with some with somebody uh we need to start a national dialogue on putting  that barn out they continue to throw gasoline on it and talk about whoever set the barn on fire  and try to get them in more trouble for like did you see him he's i saw he was throwing hay on it  right and then and then once in a while a guy comes around he goes well honestly we don't have enough  wells dug in the community we need to start okay listen troublemaker i'm focusing on the barn over  here you're you're trying to violate the soil you're part of the problem you're a soil right yeah 
[01:50:00]  everyone's just a hypocrite and a pussy and they can fuck themselves they love getting people in  trouble uh people and when they say a dialogue should be started the second you start an honest  dialogue did people crawl out of the woodwork to call you racist and fucking homophobic and and  misogynistic there's no honest open dialogue in this country you're crucified the second you're honest  about anything i've been on twitter talking about the zimmerman trial for fucking ever since it started 
[01:50:30]  and i can't tell you how many times i've been called a racist for doing nothing but quoting  fact that is going right about in this case and and statistics no one wants to hear statistics no  black well not not when it gets in the way of of their emotional argument and and look the only if you  approach every problem like i mean if if a if a doctor comes to you and says you have emphysema and 
[01:51:00]  you need to quit smoking you don't attack the doctor he's giving you information you know it's  my it might not be information you you care to hear right but it's information and if we're trying  to cure a problem you know if you have gout or whatever you have and he's telling you take it easy  on the red wine you don't go fuck that guy that doctor is horrible yeah let's run him out of town  no it's there is a problem there is a remedy for the problem and we should attempt to fix the problem  but if you attack the the doctor who gives you the news or the you know look everyone wants to be on 
[01:51:30]  the cheeseburger diet but the guy's going to come in and go look you got to eat a salad every once in  a while and if we attack him we're not going to cure the obesity problem but and that's the honest  dialogue we want to have we claim to want to have is with the doctor but he gets run out of out of  town the second he tells you to eat some kale yeah because again nobody really wants an honest  dialogue they want to hear their side of it nobody nobody makes a living off of the bullshit right 
[01:52:00]  yeah yeah it's uh astounding to me i i've been watching uh the the coverage of the the zimmerman uh  trial and and the aftermath and the revisionist history that's taken place in only a couple of days  is amazing there's no more nothing not a word on the news that he ever laid a hand on george zimmerman  now it's he was walking he was black he's an innocent boy walking with his skittles  and zimmerman followed him and shot him that's the dialogue now that's all you hear now well it's like 
[01:52:30]  first off the news you know these guys are going to get somebody killed yes because of their  misreporting and what happens is we're busy people have one ear available one eyeball available we're not  really that tuned into other people's shit you're kind of into your own family your own work your  own business the hookers whatever you got going on now jim right rolling online for prostitutes like 
[01:53:00]  whatever you're into just bringing me in you're you're into you're into that so you turn on the  news and it's just pretty much well black guy walking with skittles white guy shoots him in the back  for no apparent reason and all right let's go burn down a liquor store but it was the same thing look it  happens time and time again when when there was that poor kid who uh jumped off the tallahachie  bridge because his roommate was he was gay right and they accused his roommate of filming him with 
[01:53:30]  his gay partners and then putting it up on the internet yeah and then having parties why it was  nothing of the sort uh-huh and the guy the guy was not a criminal and the guy was not homophobic and the  guy was not everything the kid was depressed and the kid jumped off a bridge and and he was gay and  apparently his dad wasn't happy about the fact he was gay so we can have a dialogue about teen suicide  and about how to prevent teen suicide but we're not going to have that dialogue and about depression 
[01:54:00]  and 19 year olds 19 year olds don't kill themselves because they got a crappy roommate i would have killed  myself two thousand times by now they kill themselves because they're clinically depressed yeah but we had to  turn this young indian like science student into a homophobic gay bashing monster murderer and everyone  wanted his head on a stick and then at the very end so what happens is you talk to the year goes by and  you go remember that story ah yeah where that guy had the homophobic roommate who pushed him off the 
[01:54:30]  bridge and it's like no that's not what happened that has nothing to do with the story and even at the end  when the guy went to trial they didn't have anything on him because there wasn't anything  so the judge said all right we don't we don't have anything just admit you're homophobic and we'll let  you go and the guy was like no i'm not homophobic just admit it just admit like oh well i can sleep at  night yeah it's insane like you're homophobic you're xenophobic you're misogynist yet no one's ever laid a 
[01:55:00]  hand on anyone no no one's done anything to anyone it's the perception of it i'll tell you that much  so fucking sad perceiving but here's the thing that pisses me off the most none of those people  even give a shit they don't think that little kid's homophobic no they don't think george  zimmerman's white like they don't even know they just have a story and they have to turn it into  something they love it it's uh the news attainment cycle that goes on has nothing to do with actual 
[01:55:30]  news and then you get these stations like hln which used to be headline news for cnn and it was  kind of the 20 minute cycle and they would give you the headlines and uh then you'd go to cnn if  you want a more in-depth whatever uh now hln it's not headline news anymore it's just hln it's still  under the cnn flag but it is nothing to do with news it's it's nancy grace yelling her opinion  hey hey that guy is good her backwards ass opinion on shit and uh it's it's still 
[01:56:00]  disgusting people think it's the news i i i'd say more about it but i have a lawsuit against them  for the jody arias trial because they've ruined my relationship with my wife because it's she's  wrapped up the last nine 19 months of her life laying in bed watching a woman who's killed her  her husband killed her and like this is it this yeah we're done we're done going on with life  because a chick who was a seven shot a dude in the shower and stabbed that's it i i what if i just quit 
[01:56:30]  my life to watch a trial she she was fully involved oh my god i'd give jody an eight though did you see  those fucking fat pussy lips in those photos you got to jump up to an eight okay that hits her husband  with a hammer and has a fat pussy as an eight you like that all right but i'm just saying it's  you know once in a while an attractive woman kills somebody let's get over it yeah yeah move forward  we can't believe it though that's the problem is we we don't like to admit that we can't it's like 
[01:57:00]  it's like why people were surprised susan boyle could sing because we expect nothing out of pigs  so right like an attractive person does it we're utterly shocked what are you doing casey anthony very  attractive yeah no i know i know it's so sad yeah yeah fat people we expect to commit homicides for some  information they're just unpleasant so it's so true though when you see like um you know a teacher  out of florida had sex with her 15 year old student you wait to reserve your judgment until you see  the picture of the chick and if she's hot and blonde and sitting on a harley davidson you're like what's 
[01:57:30]  the big wall there there's no but if she's a pig you're like oh that kid's life has been destroyed  here's my art my argument is always the same argument like if if i was ever  her defense attorney i would take the 15 now six year old boy up to the stand who was banging the  super hot blonde you know chick and who was his teacher in florida and just go look uh your honor  every ladies and gentlemen of the court i'm not going to waste a lot of time here all i have is one 
[01:58:00]  simple question uh it's been a year since you two had uh intercourse have you beat off to her  since remember you're under oath yeah all right and would you say being 2000 or under okay ladies  and gentlemen how can there be a crime here what right vehicular manslaughter you don't beat off to  if you beat off to this moving on moving on to the next case how can you be how can you be  traumatized by something you beat off to like yeah you get carjacked well you might beat off 
[01:58:30]  someone holds you up at an atm you don't get off to it oh that's great i love these guys my head  she's in jail and they're beating off to uh what when the crime occurred yeah and and that's true  though reserving judgment do that all the time i want to see the second i see the headline i click on  the link i'm like i want to see the picture first i want to see if she's hot right that blonde on the  fucking motorcycle she was like yeah incredibly hot i know and you're like oh like where does that 
[01:59:00]  where does that happen i don't know where magic no i i had like mr saponzi the fat guy with the  male pattern baldness and a sweater vest and stuff like it smelled weird like where were these teachers  even come from teachers well can i tell you this i went to mike i have twins i went to their like first  grade whatever their teacher has a stud in her nose wow number one that number two she's got the 
[01:59:30]  full-blown uh starbucks grande latte with the you know extra whipped cream on top and that i think  and it's sitting on her desk like it's a milkshake sitting on desk like the idea of the milkshake on  your teacher but it has her first name scrawled across it oh man so i go walk over and it's just  their desk and i can see sarah just out to the class you know so i go i'm going to turn that cup  in a little bit because if they find out they call me by my first name like you're what i didn't if 
[02:00:00]  you comprehend i have no idea what any mister was the first name or miss and if you found out it was a  big deal like you found out your teacher's first name they're all the first name basis the chicks are  like 27 and wear go-go boots and have no studs and stuff it's crazy yeah finally your teacher's  first name was like finding out you know batman's identity yeah you just didn't you didn't know it  and you didn't want to know it was just not really there was no reason to god yeah it's it's all very uh 
[02:00:30]  lovey touchy feely now um yeah first name basis they had a they had a a walk-a-thon for fitness  first grade seven-year-olds walking in a circle on grass for fitness walking and every once in a  while a kid would break out into a jog and like coach marty be like hey hey safety first safety  first cool it down let's go it's like walking for a seven-year-old is nothing that's no that's zero in

[02:06:30]  the history of ink you be the judge and listen to whether or not this beating was justified it's joe de  rosa and his horrible tattoo number two you know it's funny when i was i'm sorry no go joe when i  was little please let me get out of your way i insist but i was i missed you joe i missed you too  all right yeah when i was little uh profanity used to bother me used to upset me a lot and if i was 
[02:07:00]  watching a really i was like six seven years old when i was watching a movie my mom and dad  and somebody would say fuck i would my stomach would drop in the same way it would if you see  something like visually shocking on tv like very violent you're not expecting it that crazy feeling  you get i would get that same thing when i heard fuck when i was a kid i make my mom turn the movie  off what a douche i know well i'm not saying it was just you know it's just the polar opposite of you  i failed to see how like injustice for all wait you changed your kitten tattoo yeah oh wow 
[02:07:30]  yeah sorry jimmy no we'll move on hold on we'll move on to the kitten tattoo but say what you were  going to say jimmy i'm sorry oh don't dude please i i don't even remember it was something about  language and recording and justice for all i would rather what did you do it's still healing that's  why it's red like that okay okay you can't take the abuse anymore no it wasn't that it was that  people made fun of that tattoo joe i know they did but it looked like and it looked like you wrote  kitten on your forearm but it was a george carlin quote right and i didn't i didn't have a problem with 
[02:08:00]  the kitten thing or the people in front of it what i had a problem with was it was two really large  very hard aggressive looking k's and i honestly had a few people say to me like what is that man with  this like is that arian like almost like and i i just got self-conscious i walked down the street  and i noticed sometimes like black people that kind of stare at it like what are those k's on his arm  what was it originally k k k t i t n keep kicking them in the nuts for the period so but the period 
[02:08:30]  it was all capital letters in a period i know i didn't like the period the period was a bad  decision of course it was i never thought of the k k k angle though i would respect that more you  were one k away from a nice beating yeah i know so i i what i did was to cover the k we put lines  on top of either side of it and then he was and it got rid of the period so jim should be more  comfortable and then he said we should put a line on the back but the lines were coming out to here  and i said you know what it almost could look like a microphone if we put some mesh up there  so he did and it's like a mat and now it's kind of like a cigarette wait that's not the beginning 
[02:09:00]  of it that's not the beginning of a cover-up that's it that's it it doesn't look like a  it looks like a candy cigarette it doesn't look anything like a microphone  no it doesn't it doesn't really no microphones are not that's who are you bob barker that's  no that's what it's supposed it's supposed to be like one of those old we're not we're i'm telling  you it doesn't look like a microphone just have it filled in and just say it's a black bar  and it's for you know whatever yeah he failed making that into a microphone i'm sorry joe 
[02:09:30]  who did that how about we do this bill burr it looks like a cigarette get the interns in here  do they know make sure they're not listening i'll find somebody who doesn't know because you're not  going to believe us so i'm going to march people in here and ask them what it looks like i won't say  i won't say anymore to not give it away but honestly when we were doing it we it was the part of it  it was supposed to be that was kind of abstract i didn't want it to look like this picture of a 
[02:10:00]  thing well it worked are you guys just listening to the show yeah so you you know what we're talking  about yeah what does the tattoo look like and be honest well i'm gonna it's a cover-up for his  kitten tattoo most people see hold on sydney went uh it's like a ruler it's still healing that's why  it's red and scabby it looks like a ruler what's it look like to you sydney  back home we have this kid who like gives himself tattoos at home and it looks like that 
[02:10:30]  these girls are terrific you look like that  you always come to the table with something you look like a kid from fort myers who  gives himself tattoos  if it's a microphone though where's the you know like the  the microphone is quality the head the head of the microphone  it's yeah all right wait wait wait all right all right you didn't hear  troy kwan who knows a bit about tattoos obviously wow i've got some good ones man  when are you gonna do the neck tattoo you're going there aren't you i'm thinking about it i 
[02:11:00]  know you are i could tell i could just tell you're gonna do the hand that's a big move  yeah you guys you got full sleeves now holy job someday you're never gonna that's oh the blue hand  is great what is that it's uh it's like this is all old skateboard graphics this is santa cruz  this is uh mark gonzalez tony hawk mike vallely uh steve caballero you got you really got good work  man yeah i love my one of my favorites is the fucking you might want to introduce joe de rosa to your  tattoo guy the guy listen what do you think what do you think of joe's cover-up that's a cover-up 
[02:11:30]  it's not a cover-up though don't say what it is all right what does it look like to you uh  uh kitten something no but what is what does the thing around it look yeah now it's he's turning  it into something else and and he he really thinks that the guy did a good job no but joe i'm i'm  not explaining this right all right yes we are it's before i get beat up by bill burr again for being  nasty to you what are you kidding me it's all fun i think stop it yeah go ahead it's just it's it's not 
[02:12:00]  being turned into something else i put a framing around the letters he was worried that it looked  like a kkk it did it was like the k's were too aggressive so he went to a guy and he goes look  we could soften it up a little bit we could maybe add something to it to just kind of just soften up  the tattoo it's not it's not soft it just has a border around it well he meant like kind of take  some of the emphasis off of the letters a little bit but it just takes some of the focus uh well first 
[02:12:30]  of all it's still healing so it's it's a little little scabby but it looks like uh like the one  side looks like honeycomb like like you know what i mean like yeah like so you look like security at  the honeycomb hideout we said it looks like a cigarette but it's supposed to look like something  and and he's mad he he thinks we're with him at first it looks like quick it just looks like kitten  okay you see the cigarette oh that's a cigarette no no it's not a cigarette it's supposed to be 
[02:13:00]  something else he's turning into something else hand with a screaming mouth in it which is perfectly  done and you got a rectangle wrong you've got to go to fucking troy's guy you gotta go to troy's guy  yeah this is done by the way there's no more covering it's done it's it's a done yeah i got  introducing my tattoo artist i like this what is it what is it there you know it's supposed to be  sort of just an abstract old school mike oh now he adds the word abstract i said that earlier did  you yes okay it's supposed to be abstract and it doesn't look like a microphone i guess but it's 
[02:13:30]  supposed here's why it here's why the mic looks like that when i first started recording like music  and stuff when i was in like fifth grade look at joy's face i'll explain we used to have i used to  have these little flathead mics from the 1960s that look like that and i was like oh it's kind of to me  it's like the first mic i ever used but maybe you should have taken a picture of those mics and  gave it to your tattoo artist maybe you should walk around and tell everybody that as they're 
[02:14:00]  looking at your arm like what the is that ruler honeycomb thing you're gonna get tired of telling  that story over and over again but here's my thing i hear what you're saying i don't give a  if anybody gets it or not my point is is once that's healed and whatever i don't think you'd look  at that and be like what the you just be like he's got some weird thing that i don't know you would  look like there's something on the end that you maybe you covered up yeah it's permanent  yeah and tattoo laser removal is getting really good yeah now is it really yeah i can think of  three that you want to have removed what do you mean by really good would you see scarring there or 
[02:14:30]  or the tattoo really faded out really starts to fade out you barely could tell there was a tattoo  over there yeah and if you keep doing it it'll eventually go away but it'll fade enough where you  could cover it up you could get something to cover it up is it painful to do yeah it hurts like yeah  what do they do uh they basically go in and just break the pigment down and then your body actually  just starts flushing it out how do they break it down with a needle uh no with a laser why does it  hurt can't they numb it uh i'm sure they could but when you go into that when you start doing numbing 
[02:15:00]  you have to have like a doctor's license to do stuff like that oh really so you just need a certain  license to take the pain yeah but there are people that could do both right can they either numb it  yeah there's a there's a yeah i mean if they're if they're certified in in you know yeah being able to do  that joe let's talk about this we think what's going on on the other one those are new too huh  this one's new this one's old i've had that one long what is the let's see this yeah 
[02:15:30]  you send it to the mic it's a valid question does that remind you to stop getting tattoos  she's terrific every time so that's a good one that's a home run sydney yes it was it was it  hurt a little bit what is it supposed to uh the circle it's a lot of things is there anyway i'm  going to explain this and not just get trashed all right from front to back but the locations are  even awful like your locations make everyone uncomfortable but one is like off to this off  center on the forearm one is under the fucking crook of the elbow that tattoo looks like it's 
[02:16:00]  slipping off his bicep what's off center this one yeah no the other one and they're  the fucking kitten honeycomb microphone abstract were you drunk when you got those no no you were  fully aware of what you were doing yeah yeah oh it's coming here's here's the uh can you explain  that tattoo the new one i can this is the newest one all right but the one that the circle with a  line through it i can explain all these this one was fine it went it worked it was what i wanted it 
[02:16:30]  looked the way i wanted yeah it was exactly what i wanted it was perfect it was exactly what i wanted  right on this one the with the letters that that's getting being screwed on yeah yes this one the uh  tattoo artist was supposed to i was new to tattoos and the tattoo artist was supposed to select all  these fonts and we're supposed to work through it together and all this stuff she never did any of  the work she showed up 40 minutes late for the appointment i was panicking and i just was like 
[02:17:00]  fuck it just do this font please and uh and i regret it where were you going to that you needed a  permanent tattoo by quickly why wouldn't you at that point just leave and go okay it doesn't feel  right it takes a week it was because it was impulsive and it was stupid it was a better message and you  weren't fucked up no no how much did she charge you for that uh like a hundred bucks so you're trying  to be a skinflint you're trying to save money are you cheapskate no it's a nice shop that she worked  i can't name it because it's going to sound slanderous or whatever but uh it's a nice shop like they work on a lot of 
[02:17:30]  reputable people i'd say you know so was she knew they were breaking her in with you no she just  it's fucking didn't do what the fuck she was supposed to do you know like would you tolerate  that troy no i look at troy's letters on taking care of business just like elvis had troy do you  have one bad tattoo on you i could even point to my legs i got when i was a kid but like i just  stopped going to look at the work on troy yeah well this guy is just impressive i had a book this  appointment for uh last september for like now this guy justin weatherholtz at king's avenue he's 
[02:18:00]  he's awesome he's a year out yeah jesus but i knew i was going to do my forearm so i wanted him to do  it how much did that cost that blue hand uh it just i did it all like it's basically like 200 an  hour and i just paid i've had it paid off for a while so so wait a minute you had to book did what's  his name justin weatherholtz he's really great he's amazing yeah he's at king's avenue tattoo  people know uh he's he's getting a big name for himself yeah he's on instagram you can check out  his work on people have to a book a year in advance yeah i should get a tattoo you should  he would hook it up for you too he would take care of you really yeah what's that no it can inform 
[02:18:30]  my heart oh good yeah what kind of tattoo would jim norton get i don't know something really cool  like maybe uh an aussie tattoo yeah i thought but without the disdain yeah that was very rochester  loading you hear that aussie tattoo i would probably get like kensington to me yeah she was right i'd  probably get like a fucking eagle flying over a sun fuck yeah oh yeah yeah giving a thumbs up 
[02:19:00]  what you fly sometimes i know that big delicious cock's about to spill out into some lucky mouth  i add you i add you to the list of people that have failed the test that's right looking at my  crotch joe de rosa how do you miss it because you went up and then the buttons are flaring so i  get lazy you get the button flies i button most of them it's really that bad really yeah it's kind  of bad compared compared compared to Troy Kwan yeah how about we do that we'll get both of you guys  some uh followers on twitter today no no both of you put your arms out no i know i know i'm gonna get 
[02:19:30]  i know it's gonna get trash look in the in the guy that i went to is actually very very good in his  defense he didn't have a lot to work with here because he he wanted to do like but you can't just  framing around and everything i was like don't i just want to keep it streamlined very simple there's  nothing in that that that says the guy's good no it's not good huh well would it i mean he didn't  do this part he just put lines on it you know it's right that's what i asked him to do explain the new  one you still have it this is a lot of different things this is still healing too there's a lot of  different things this is sort of a tribute to bad religion it's it's a symbol to to mean agnostic it's 
[02:20:00]  sort of my concept of on life of kind of not believing in a lot of things not subscribing  to a lot of things it sort of just means a bunch of different things see Troy's shaking his head  though why why don't you like this one it's just hey Troy i mean that's okay i'm not going to be  afraid i mean they're just not my thing but they're very basic you go for a very basic tattoo i like  skin tones you could have real nice color i know but the problem is is you have a much much much nicer 
[02:20:30]  body than i do so when you went like so color and shitty tattoos on a shitty body was red and  and it looked like nicer and then just it just doesn't look right like i look better with you  why it looked like ghostbusters tell everybody why that's why so it wasn't that it didn't look nice  people thought his his statement about atheism was a ghostbusters  he's obsessed with ghostbusters joe's trying to make a social statement and they think it's a  fucking giant marshmallow movie reference and they're just thinking about ray parker jr yeah 
[02:21:00]  boom boom boom boom that's why i like ghostbusters too exactly your pale palette of a body is perfect  joe you got a kitten tattoo and a ghostbusters that's exactly oh fuck i don't know what to do  redo it redo it you could redo all that they're not they're not beyond repair if he likes it then  he doesn't like it he hates them and he's trying this is the conversation he has in the mirror it's  like an old school fucking microphone it's not but what do i do with this exactly lock your arm off 
[02:21:30]  and then have it removed i don't have it removed no fucking way why i'm at least lightened it then  do something over top of it why do you get a picture of carlin's face tattooed what does the  kitten mean like what does that it was a george carlin i met george carlin he said keep kicking them  in the nuts and then that's why there's a microphone kind of around it so why wouldn't you do like a cool  maybe like a carlin portrait and maybe have like a banner underneath it that said that  or something like yeah why not i didn't think of it 
[02:22:00]  the classic like oh i wish i thought you want to make a statement how about you have  shit piss cunt fuck cocksucker motherfucker and tits tattooed on your foot because he said that with  the period he did see if i said to everybody he did no that was his advice he never said that to me we had  a real conversation but so you keep kicking him in the nuts he didn't know what you did yeah you  could have done like a cool banner how long how long did you talk to him i talked to him for like  seven minutes one day we're all huge george carlin on the phone you didn't need to talk to him on 
[02:22:30]  the phone how did that he was on my friend's radio show and i called up i was like one of the only  callers because nobody was on the show and i talked about comedy i said you're my idol you know what  then you should have done it with a phone instead of a microphone because you talked to him on the  phone exactly that would make more sense you're gonna get a picture of you you'd have yourself  tattooed sitting by a window staring out at your phone or you should take an old school telephone  and strangle yourself the worst of the week countdown countdown countdown what is happening behind me 
[02:23:00]  nothing absolutely don't worry about it bro what fuck off what's happening behind me i think he was  imitating like i don't know a cat like covering up the turd well roland is might have been the  turd in that scenario i'm not really sure though look he's covering roland's flipping you off making  gestures in his crotch and then kicking imaginary dirt on you he's shooting imaginary jizz on you  meaning what i don't even get it i don't know he's just doing things that are disrespectful to you  why is that crying because it's funny the stuff you find funny though there's been a lot of funny 
[02:23:30]  stuff but it's this that makes you cry sam has this whole after show planned right here yeah i  know you're saying right john i don't know maybe bro whoa maybe roll and comment i mean if we can  talk honestly can we always talk around for once try does not agree but you fought over a girl with a  penis like what does that say so what does that say about you mean me or joe please clarify but why 
[02:24:00]  why does this disgust you so much just because it just that girl was that girl was insane do you  un but you're not hearing what i'm saying to you right now if ava mendez is a 10  oh danny your story might have to wait if ava mendez is a 10 right out of the fresh morning no  shower that girl's an eight come on troy oh seven i think seven's fair i think it's very fair  i'm not being mean i think it's just a fair statement that's a little i don't know the same  way he makes you angry you get me my my feathers ruffled why just i don't know joe he hasn't let go 
[02:24:30]  of the other thing huh he never let go that other thing that he said i don't think he has he never  let that the other day when it when it came up when i go me and troy are cool now you know i'm not  trying to be in front of him here's what he ran into this fucking room like there was money being  given away we were on the after show and calling rolling out on some bullshit and then roland was  like well troy you talk shit about joe and you know what troy's response was i never said i liked joe 
[02:25:00]  i don't think we're fine we're fine he's they didn't get over the other thing when they were  fighting i'm gonna take it as the further i don't think troy ever liked me even when we were like  supposedly friends i think he was just plotting and making the fucking joke we were ever friends we  were pretty friendly we used to hang out at functions yeah we're cordial but i mean like  when we would go to ants barbecues we would sit and hang out for a long time and talk i would say  we're friendly people i hang out with on a regular basis i would say we were it seemed like we were 
[02:25:30]  on our way to potentially swapping numbers and then you just you sunk that shit but then and i hold  a grudge i still have anger towards people i had in high school so like i don't get over  shit easy all right it's fine now why do you have a grudge against joe what exactly did he do oh  jeez no no no that's not gonna answer i'm not being combative jim i'm saying like this is a  it's a long thing it's a long story yeah the short of it is you weren't here this the one i would  rather build uh you know new hatred and some of the old we're not gonna go back to hatred but let's 
[02:26:00]  get some new you were out the day it happened i was filling in for you and troy i started making  fun of troy's shoes or something and then and my jeans and by the way you're wearing diesel jeans today  and van jeans and sneakers with with rips in them that you goofed on me for right right oh  shit but troy you were on that shit like a year ago troy we're we're past it it's a year later yeah  i told you i don't let go of shit i've already apologized because he's doing this you're going  back to the ripped jeans wow he's never forgot he made i was wearing diesel jeans and i had like 
[02:26:30]  i had these in my closet when i was making fun of him that wasn't the point cool the point was  because he's making fun of him i mean he does that's not cool of course that don't make no  sense that don't make any sense thank you anyway the point is is i i made some jokes troy got a  little angry and then it carried over into an actual fight a month later when again you weren't here  when you fucked with your livelihood and uh yeah i've heard about that one and we got in a big fight  and then and then we didn't talk for a long time and then finally at the uh caroline's christmas party 
[02:27:00]  i went to troy i said troy can we just let this go like oh i was at that party and then he said yeah  yeah and we were at least i thought everything was cool he never let it go he didn't let it go  he said yes he was lying he lied he lied to you joe we're fine but the problem is jim starts  shit back up jim's taking his pants no listen he's not i'm not gonna get angry i'm not i'm not  i'm not angry you we're fine what is he doing he took his pants off i have to go to the gym directly  after this and then troy and i still have to do something so while you're talking i'm just changing  so i don't have to do it at the gym i'm very pressed for time he put his gym sweats on 
[02:27:30]  yeah it's very pressed for those are those are the thinnest sweats i've ever seen  like my cock to breathe he likes to show off the cock yeah the worst of the week countdown  i'm mark goodman i'm martha quinn i'm nina blackwood i'm alan hutter and we're the original  mtv vjs sirius xm channels can now be personalized online to fit your taste with my sxm like on our  channel the big 80s on eight want more rock or maybe dance one more early 80s songs

[02:34:30]  have hooked up with you if it was possible as you stood on where did they shoot that and that was one of  the the scene that stuck with me oh man where you're standing on the outside of the tower and uh jessica  lang and the ape on the other uh yeah and that was a horrifying moment to me you know it was a wild  thing during that when we were shooting that this little guy comes up to me and he says uh do you  how do you like my temple i see your temple he says yes this is my temple i said what are you talking 
[02:35:00]  about he says oh yes i tight roped across and philippe oh no kidding and he lived right across the street  from that and he would look up at that thing every day you know this was just you know we were  we're obsessed with uh philippe petite what he did that day man we talk about it all the time and  then he was sentenced to what uh to perform for free in the park for a year or something and that  was but that was the year we were making kong and that was it was wild he taught me how to juggle  which i think the thing about that day like now they figure all that stuff out and they test everything 
[02:35:30]  he just he snuck in and then he's you saw the documentary right oh yeah where he shot the arrow to get  the line across and then that that would imagine he didn't know if it was all going to be you know  secure enough and and he and he was he was planning that for years right all his friends you know where  you're laughing at it and say yeah we're with you and they all fell out except for his best friend who  went over to the other side it was just him and his god what a story and then he laid down on the 
[02:36:00]  wire between the towers and that's what freaks me and jimmy out he said he saw planes flying above  him not just walking but he did a 45 minute show so he's been here and talked to you guys yeah a  few years back we talked to him and then we just had nick uh willenda a couple weeks ago who did the  grand canyon thing oh wow something about the towers though there's something about the way he had to  rig that and sneak in that makes that so impressive amazing did it annoy you a little bit though that  you guys are doing this movie and he had to come over and just go hey i walked between those yeah it 
[02:36:30]  does it bug you a little bit then he had to come and get a little you know kind of why would that  bug me i was he i don't know because if he's kind of coming over and getting you know okay you know  actually you know what what his connection was he used to perform with jessica lang yeah in france  she was kind of a street performer so he knew her yeah oh okay there you go did you remember him  oh yeah yeah they're buds yeah did you like the remake i mean it's always weird if you i mean even  okay your version was a remake of course yeah but our version was kind of a joke you know you had 
[02:37:00]  this guy you know uh rick baker in the suit you know and then they would cut to this you know 90  foot tall you know statue of an ape and yeah it was ridiculous no i thought the new thing was  the new one was you know kind of spectacular the ape was incredible you freaked me out what i didn't  like about the 77 version had nothing to do with you or the acting it was that in the movie poster because  i was like nine at the time in the movie poster they show kong straddling both buildings holding planes  and you're like he's huge oh yeah yeah but in the movie he didn't do that no no he had to jump from 
[02:37:30]  one building to the other i was very i felt very gypped i remember as a kid you know pretending to be  sick so i could stay home and watch the original i used to love that thing the original original kong  oh yeah that was that was great what what made you get into acting i guess bo got into it first and of  course your father my dad i mean he uh he wanted all of his kids to get into showbiz he just loved it  it was kind of unusual for an actor you know but he uh he really dug it you know wanted the salt 
[02:38:00]  to go into it he was great at it too that's just the opposite right that i need to tell you that  yeah you you hear a lot from uh you know guys like yourself that i don't want my kids to go into  this business too yeah yeah but he dug it man oh he he said you gotta do it i i wanted you know for  a long time i wanted to uh i said well i don't know dad you know i'm thinking music you know maybe  he says oh jeff come on he says you know you could you're gonna be able to play all sorts of 
[02:38:30]  things if you're an actor you know you'll get to you know do the musician thing whatever you like  you know you use all of it so i'm glad i i followed his instruction what instrument do you play yeah  guitar and piano you're supposed to be very good i've heard you're very good oh i'm you know not real  great musician but i love playing music i'm going out in the uh the road here in a couple of days  with my band you know the band yeah yeah my daughter jesse's gonna open for me oh yeah yeah  that sounds cool yeah so uh what's the name of your band and what kind of music you play the abiders 
[02:39:00]  nice little country a little rock and do you sing stuff saying okay writes tunes you know that's cool  a lot of actors are doing kevin bacon's got the band with his brother i mean we do he was in this movie  that's coming out the r.i.pd and we jammed when we were you know making that movie that was a lot of  fun oh yeah a lot of actors you know juliet uh lewis is like she's she's got like a lot of music  out she loves it yeah she's she's wonderful and her dad you know jeff lewis we've worked together 
[02:39:30]  before i don't know him oh yeah he's uh he's been in all the clint eastwood movies you'd recognize him  if you saw oh really i'm gonna look that up i'm gonna google that that was your first by the  the way oscar nomination was for the eastwood movie you did uh i know i'm a thunder uh thunder  bolt and lightfoot a picture show was before that oh is that your second yeah yeah but but  but jeff lewis was in thunderbolt and lightfoot but who did he play i don't remember the movie  you know there were you know there was uh arthur uh george kennedy and it was he was george kennedy's  sidekick do you find doing films now that are the scripts i i find like a lot of the films are 
[02:40:00]  not like they're just doing reboots and remakes of what they already did i know man and i don't  know what that is yeah well it's uh you know it's the show business the business aspect of showbiz you  know and they i guess the financiers want a sure bet or something but uh they don't want to take as many  chances yeah i think the fresh stuff that's what people want to see they want to see something  different absolutely can i tell you one of my favorite things you ever did you play a great psychopath 
[02:40:30]  was uh was the remake of the vanishing oh yeah but the original was much better man come on you  see the original i did the french one yeah i'll see because that my guy you know my character he  got away with it yeah and it was bizarre the same director directed both of them and he wanted i guess  he wanted the he wanted to change it up he wanted the american version but it softened it i thought do  you think he wanted it or the studio told him no he he wanted it that way the studio probably wanted  it that way too but i think he was into it wasn't that uh it was one of sandra bullock's early movies 
[02:41:00]  it might have been her first i think i don't know well you she plays uh keeper sutherland all of a  sudden they're at a rest stop and she disappears yeah and uh he becomes obsessed with just finding  diane and he wants to find his girlfriend because she's gone right and then it turns out that you  fucking barney oh god but the original was a masterpiece i thought that's what got me  on board on that movie now we got to see the original oh god how did the original end the 
[02:41:30]  original ends when this guy's family who buries you know all these people alive he's having a picnic  with his family yeah you know at his cabin past the ketchup you know and you know underneath that table  under the table there are all these people he buried alive oh wow life goes on you know well they  let you know because the thing was he didn't know i don't remember in the french version he didn't  know how diane died he became obsessed with knowing what happened to her so he barney approaches  him and says i will you'll experience everything she experienced yeah yeah and that leads us to a 
[02:42:00]  question why do you think in america we need that happy ending or we need everything tied up all nice  by the end of a movie oh that's how we want life to be but only in america because when you do see the  foreign films still they they will go in those other directions every once in a while uh an american movie  will go dark uh and we love it i dug it when uh what was that movie it did about with uh what was  it uh i can't think of the name you know the the bomb the scare you know i get blown up i can't think 
[02:42:30]  i'll come it'll come to me in a second early in the morning that was a very dark ending of this  particular movie i remember the studio we got a note from the studio we want you to shoot a positive ending  and we went ah and the director made a very bold choice he said let's shoot it arlington road is  the name of the movie oh just a little movie called arlington road and he says let's make  we're going to we've got to do it but we're going to make it terrible we're going to just do a terrible 
[02:43:00]  job because you know we could have we could have lost they could just say thank you and put that on  there but thank god they didn't that's great that's hilarious yeah but that's typical studio thinking i  guess it's just let's just get one for the case the focus groups don't like uh even in our dumb  world we get that like oh that was really good but let's shoot a safety yeah and do it this way  you're like oh that's the one they're going to use yeah do you think focus groups have hurt movies  and stuff i mean they make them more financially probably successful but do you think they've hurt 
[02:43:30]  like what what films could become uh maybe i you know i i i like uh the director to have the you  know the vision one guy just let him do his deal you know that's that's my you know that's what i  would vote for what motivates you to take a role because this you've turned down a few gems um  which ones because that's i hear rumors that i've turned down all kinds of things it's not uh hooper  and jaws no right here turn down the role of hooper in jaws that's uh i don't know who hooper is 
[02:44:00]  who's hooper oh hooper was hooper was the shark no it was uh matt hooper was uh richard dreyfuss's  part oh no no okay that's one our our sal got wrong was that sal unless i what unless i wasn't  i don't even know about it you know that maybe your agent did yeah well do you know what of one  that you did turn down no yeah not really i can't think of anything i turned down that i wish i hadn't  you know right right but what did you turn down that would be considered a big movie  because you guys all have to have one i can't even did you turn down the lead in raiders of the lost 
[02:44:30]  arc no negative i've heard that one okay wait it's on the list oh yeah i would never make this up oh  that's hilarious okay those were do you have any more or is that it for him yeah um were you really  in true grit let's just make sure that i have i have the right stuff i'd like i'd like to well  on that one you know true grit working with the brothers you know they're they're the master of  filmmakers you know so anything they want me to do i'm on board what motivates you to take a role 
[02:45:00]  obviously you have to like it but is are there other do you do you care about who you're working  with or do you care about yeah yeah that's a big part of it uh the kind of movie i'd like to see you  you know that's kind of the where the filmmakers are kind of ahead of you something fresh you know  that's you know a little different and what do you do they say you you meditate before you go on  set or is that just another lie that's been thrown into the preps it's a semi-lie i meditate at times  you do you know well you don't do it before you walk on set every time not every time okay but 
[02:45:30]  we just have no accurate information your name is spelled j-e-f-f three f it's  fucking amazing i love meditation i just got into it you said yeah i just got into it i don't know what  the hell i'm doing mr bridges that's that's that's you're but i like it isn't it cool it's it's cool  oh yeah it settles my brain and i want to get into it even deeper and try to figure it all out  just 10 minutes a day just by yourself oh man trying to get that brain silent i can't make myself do it 
[02:46:00]  my mind just won't stop well that's nonsense that's okay that's what the mind does you know you should  let it do your thing and just say thanks and go back to your yeah right right yeah what do you do if  you itch i always have an itch like if i'm trying to relax and not doing things something itches well  that means you're not really meditating because all that goes away if you do it properly i know  i've never done it properly in my life because i do it i do it um on the upper west side and it's  really loud outside the window and you hear the trucks and next thing you know you go whoa wait i 
[02:46:30]  didn't hear the trucks for the last 10 minutes then you know you're meditating i wrote a book recently  you know called the dude and the zen master nice and the zen master is this cat named bernie glassman  right who is a homeboy here and he's you know from new york and we had a great time making that and  he's a he's a wonderful guy yeah he's uh what's it about it's about uh you know about sitting but  bernie came to me and he said uh jeff you realize in buddhist circles the dude is considered 
[02:47:00]  the zen master i said what are you talking about man he says oh yeah he says yeah lebowski is full  of modern day koans koans are these kind of zen you know questions that you have to you know answer  experience right sort of and i said what are you talking about he says well look at it the koan  brothers you know for one thing they mentions all these uh koans like you know the you know like 
[02:47:30]  probably one of the most famous coins what's the sound of one hand clapping you know that kind of  thing you know makes your money and i said well give me an example he said well you know shut the  up donnie there's a koan for you you know and he kind of explained that or the dude abides or whatever  he says let's write a book about uh about uh the koans that are in lebowski so that's what the book is  about nice i'm gonna have to pick that up yeah yeah i can talk to jeff bridges all morning yeah all i  want to do is ask you questions about movies you're all fearless i loved fearless one of the 
[02:48:00]  big lebowski obviously oh that's a good just fearless or big lebowski both both oh the big  i think fearless big lebowski got a tremendous amount of love but fearless i thought was very  underrated yeah oh yeah in hindsight i thought so jagged edge going way back i mean you know it's crazy  look at how many movies he's done yeah it's a very impressive resume going back to i think the early  70s now you've had a bomb or two right is that a bit yeah is that a bad feeling when you know the 
[02:48:30]  movie just didn't work sometimes yeah you know sometimes you know so many things have to come  together to make it you know a success uh uh you got to count on so many people doing their parts  you know yeah i remember i made a movie that i really enjoyed um called the amateurs great cast uh  it was all about you know a little town making a porn movie it was we had a great time and it you  know some uh the guy who distributed you know was a crook and it never they just never saw the light 
[02:49:00]  of day at all you know but you gotta you know kind of let it go so is that movie not out there anywhere  it's probably on dvd or something it's really funny ted danson is just great and wonderful that's so  weird yeah well they just show all the time they just put the movie on the shelf oh yeah for years  well yeah the guy went bankrupt i mean you know and no one could go and say screw it let's try to  figure out how to get this out there no yeah drove the poor writer and director uh who was 
[02:49:30]  who was wonderful mike trager kind of you know gave him a stroke and can you imagine working on  something for a couple of years and then just it's your baby oh and you love yeah it's your baby  and you get jeff bridges and ted danson to do it right oh man like that's a miracle in itself is  there is there is there a monologue you look back on or a moment you look back on and you go like  that if you know if i that's something i would want everyone to remember me by like one one moment  or one monologue that you felt like i did that really well uh one that comes to mind i don't know 
[02:50:00]  if it was a monologue but it just popped in my head was uh the dude uh getting into uh the car with  the big lebowski you know trying to back pedal you know and getting the toe and all that i dug that  scene quite a bit yeah that movies yeah well those guys those writers man i mean they were great brothers  they made a lot of great films and they make it look so easy you know right yeah i think he's got  to go thanks well yeah the last thing i have to say is uh we interviewed your brother once on the phone 
[02:50:30]  the incident is fantastic yeah drives me nuts that everybody doesn't know that oh yeah that's  a great movie was that his first marty shane yeah yeah yeah and uh it was his first but that was  early yeah and ed mcmahon ed mcmahon right and that brock peters it was such a great movie yeah  about a just a problem on a train it was martin's first movie i really don't know the movie oh it's  now i gotta see that too tony massante it was really great and that's all i wanted to do is talk 
[02:51:00]  to beau bridges about it so whenever there's a bridges around yeah you have to mention it sure  all right r-i-p-d uh obviously with ryan randleton jeff bridges oh you are on twitter the jeff bridges  spelled with a j j-e-f-f bridges on twitter and uh do you do you read all your at mentions no man  i don't even know what that is my at mentions i i you know i have someone to handle all the  facebook and tweeters though what's this vining do you know about that what is that how  that's the next thing uh it's uh people are enjoying it what is it six seven six second

[02:59:30]  movie he's making and i'm sitting on the set and i sit behind the cameras and the screens and all you  you know and i i see all the technical stuff and i and i understand a lot and i'm learning a lot  besides the work i'm doing on the movie and uh what i'm saying is i think i then another couple  weeks i'll be able to direct direct a movie i think yeah you were showing me last night a little bit of  how to direct and it was all just kind of like let's roll again that's what you were doing i said do 
[03:00:00]  you think you could direct you said yes let's roll again let's roll take it from the other side let's  do a reverse let's do a reverse uh okay stop there and let's do a jump cut okay you don't think it's  more than just knowing like oh you got to know where stuff is tying in you got to know how to play the  scene out when when does the scene end where do you think does chris ever give like i mean this is not  uh like a balls out kind of comedy this has got some substance to it so does he ever give like 
[03:00:30]  direction on the like emotional part of the scene like does he ever be like i think he'd be sadder  first of all first of all i'm not going to tell you chris's secrets but believe me and i'm not just  saying they're probably not secrets believe me i'm not just saying this quite quite a smart person who  chris who are we talking about i i would not have surprised me if you then said me like not me you 
[03:01:00]  i'm not gonna lie besides funny and i'm not just saying this he's quite smart and quite knowledgeable  and when you when you talk about someone's intelligence you tend to use the word quite  isn't that a lot quite means very a lot this is how what a jackass i am on the set yesterday oh my  god this is what a jackass i am uh they brought uh uh fried chicken from from sylvia's and you know 
[03:01:30]  it's an iconic restaurant well we were we were shooting right shooting up we were shooting uptown  yesterday okay we're shooting uptown and and then they sent over a bunch of fried chicken from from  sylvia's so you know we're eating it and it's it tastes really good and chris says asked me chris goes 
[03:02:00]  have you ever been to sylvia's and i go no no but i've been to roscoe's which is the other fried  chicken place in la no i haven't eaten uh uh you know uh negro food in new york but i have in negro  what do i say african-american it's not funny if you say african-american food  no but it does the way it sounded like i was like i listened to a podcast the day where a woman was  talking about her race and she was like i'm a negro she kept saying negro it was so weird it sounded so 
[03:02:30]  well is she black she wasn't this was what the podcast was about she's white then why would she  say um because but going back in her family tree you know she's black she just identifies as being  black because the rest of the town's really racist and they sort of like said early on she that her  family was excuse me excuse me black even though she looks white um i guess they knew her family 
[03:03:00]  history whatever so then they and so then she owned it like um negro but then she had two daughters one  identifies as black and the other one won't it says she's white well anyhow i said  i said i haven't eaten at sylvia's but i've eaten that right you're like what kind of answer what did he  say nothing he smashed a fried chicken in my face no what did he do nothing he just didn't it just  ignored it yeah i mean you know he's got a million things on his mind he's starring and directing now 
[03:03:30]  i always think like if you make any little mistake about race like black people think that you're  being racist not at all he but do they just let it go yeah and when i say they i mean all of them  first of all people black people white people uh there is there is there any other kinds no  if someone's being racist or or anti-semitic or anti-white or you you know it you you can feel 
[03:04:00]  from that person or you know that person you can pretty much read or feel what that person's  i know but ignorance also makes you kind of irritated yeah people are ignorant about  well like when people are ignorant about canada i kind of get a little like oh god  it's not people aren't ignorant about canada people don't care about canada well they don't  who care i don't care if they care or not then why they bring it up at all who would why would  they bring it up people do they bring up canada like the little tiny they just because it's just 
[03:04:30]  small talk people always want to try to like somehow relate to you so they yeah but you're stupid  shit you are like you're you're you're you know both both sides of the fence betty because one  second you'll trash canada how they act up there but then you get mad if other people i don't get  mad i don't get mad i don't care if people are funny about canada or trash it um i don't like it when  it's not like if if somebody was trashing canada and it was real i would think it was funny but it's  the hacky shit it just kind of gets annoying it gets boring and like everybody hates hacky shit 
[03:05:00]  anyhow yeah you know like when when they're like i mean the other thing that sort of drives me nuts  about some of the americans that i've met is that a lot of them have never been to canada yet they  assume they know everything about canada like people often are like it's the same it's exactly the  same having never been there it's not exactly the same there's a lot of differences yes  yes i agree and i don't want to go over the differences but i know there's differences 
[03:05:30]  between new jersey there's no like black people in canada no different races in canada there there  is a lot no yes yes it's um canada is did you go yes yes like i didn't know that yes no i'm speaking  to a larger audience canada is 97 indian it no you're fucking and when she says indian  she means no i don't oh you know i don't you mean like eastern whatever 
[03:06:00]  oh here's you know east asian you know there was a comic an old like my friend called me  yesterday and said oh is this a new topic yeah we're done with canada aren't we did you get it out  yeah i like to have a little like a ding ding ding ding new topic oh new topic new topic with rich  voss ding ding ding ding ding dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong 
[03:06:30]  new topic there was that good or was that too that's perfect that too oriental it sounded slightly  but i kind of liked it because we were just coming off of that well my friend nancy ryan  uh she's living in vegas she lives in vegas comedian comedian married to another comedian  like very funny john bazaar both of them very funny nancy who i talked to yesterday has been  working five and a half years on one show the same show in vegas at the flamingo you know one of those  review review shows and she's the comedian on the review you know what is it i just told you it's a 
[03:07:00]  review show what kind of interviewer are you really rich what there's no name for it you just  hey you want to go to a review show tonight where is it no i just told you everything you need to know  no it's a it's a review show it's a burlesque whatever burlesque okay i just wanted to know the  name of it is it like i don't know uh uh fuck girls i don't know what it's called it's fuck girls 
[03:07:30]  no it's a burlesque okay so you don't so then you would say instead of yelling at me i just  told you you would say oh i don't know the name of it you could try that it's a burlesque  variety show at the flamingo and she's the comedian who's been doing it five what's the name of it  uh it's called i don't fucking know i don't know the name of it okay okay how hard is it how hard is 
[03:08:00]  it to say who cares how hard is it to say i don't know the name of it but it's at the flamingo how many  all that stuff you were so reluctant to say you don't know but how many this would help you in  life tremendously that's why i wanted to tell the story without learn to say i don't know so she  texts me that a comic did a joke on facebook that was completely my joke from he put it in his uh  in one of his uh what status updates or they call it uh-huh and it's a joke i did 
[03:08:30]  20 years ago now but this guy knows you right or you know him so he knew that it was your joke  most likely but it's 20 years old i haven't done the joke but he did it word for word yeah i haven't  done the joke in probably three or four months i mean it's 20 no i'm only kidding i think and i i hate  to put you on the spot but we'd love to hear the joke oh the joke was uh god oh i'm kind of depressed  we had to put my grandfather in a rest home today well not actually we didn't have the money so we 
[03:09:00]  drove down the turnpike and put him in a rest area great no it's a great joke no it isn't when you're  first starting comedy it's a good joke and that's what i did when i first started i go you know and  then i remember i don't even remember the tag after you know whatever but when you're first starting  comedy it's okay so i did it and uh a lot of times sometimes it didn't work i love though that  you're pretending like you just started comedy 20 years ago you'd already been doing it 17 years 
[03:09:30]  no i've been doing comedy about 30 years 29 30 years so just starting was not 10 years in  so then that joke then that joke is 20 25 years old you know 26 years old okay you know i had it  like three or four years and maybe three years in okay so it's 27 so he doesn't and it's no big  deal not at all but i i write on facebook i go you know because people were going is that rich 
[03:10:00]  foss is killed from when and then and gary i mean people really did post that a couple people yeah  and then uh i mean comics two comics he goes on so i wrote something like you know i please  believe me i don't oh and then some i go please believe me i don't care well no no there's some  lady wrote uh rips for us we saw him at uncle vinnie's there was 10 people which there was never  only 10 people there but the club does sometimes not get a lot of people she said he didn't want to 
[03:10:30]  season at the shore i mean he said she said uh this is what pissed me off she said he didn't want to be  on stage he just picked on everybody we left right so i just saw that written about wanda sykes  so really what she was picking she's not that she was picking up but that she didn't want to be on  stage she was in a bad mood yeah so everybody gets it it's like they think they go to work honestly  everyone else on the planet goes to work and is shitty every single day except for maybe two out 
[03:11:00]  of the month they'll like somebody how be in a good mood and be good at their job that i shouldn't say  that's not true that people are probably good at their job but i mean i see lots of people who are  not in good moods at their jobs and yet a comedian they're like if you have one i mean i remember i  had an off night and it's not even off night you don't have to be in a good mood you can still have  a good night i mean well i it wasn't like i did terribly but i i whatever it was at the philly but  the one guy couldn't stop emailing about it we had made these big plans and you know what and i wrote 
[03:11:30]  him back i go i'm sorry i had an off night like i wasn't trying to whatever and um i mean that was  the night the mic was going out like it wasn't all what are you talking about in philly when we were  at helium yes there was like an issue with the mic and remember i kept going backstage and talking to  you backstage with the mic and yeah which i thought was kind of funny yes they could still hear you hear  me out there whatever but it was like there was a lot kind of weird shit that happened in the 
[03:12:00]  beginning and then i was trying to be funny about it and i guess they didn't think i was but  i mean the guy would not let it go i was like really you've never never had a shitty day at work  never never never well congratulations that's just wonderful you know i i've had people and people you  know we came out on our anniversary see they don't understand especially with me well and then she said he  he was in a bad mood he didn't want to be there he just picked on everybody now one quit using the 
[03:12:30]  word doing crowd work or fucking when there's say 15 or 20 people it's a light you know there's clubs  in new york all the time that have like 15 people or 20 or and you sit on the stool and you make it  intimate you do crowd work summer jokes summer whatever okay like paula poundstone got letters  like yeah why why are you picking on everyone in the audience yeah and she does all crowd work  pretty much yeah yeah you know i mix it up i do some crowd work but some material but everybody thinks 
[03:13:00]  once you do crowd work then they think oh he doesn't have an act you know hard in a in any situation  it is to do good crowd work not saying i do good or bad which i do do good sometimes i do bad sometimes  like anything you said doodoo huh doodoo yes so so the bottom line is to this lady bottom line you  know shut up quit quitting we left he was mean enough already okay but also and here is you know 
[03:13:30]  sometimes i have like i just want to say this so that people don't think i'm like a crazy  person but i've seen you be mean to audience members before okay so i have seen that but if you're  going to see rich voss like aren't isn't that what you part of the experience of it i mean in a funny  way not mean like i mean no i've never seen you well well it's hard to say because when people are  laughing and it's mean it's still funny but well i felt bad and i'm surprised that people don't get 
[03:14:00]  more upset actually sometimes in a weird way because sometimes it's like because sometimes people are  laughing so hard when you're making fun like there are women sometimes are laughing so hard and you're  making fun of their looks i can't believe it like i don't know if i would have that kind of  constitution to take that in front of an audience we have a visitor hold on we'll get back to this in  a second there's a bug in your room well name it and then it's a pet oh good idea do you have a pet 
[03:14:30]  bug what's your pet bug's name well go up there see if the bug is gone and then we used to get two  stories so no i can't tell a story without without somebody reina you said listen to my story why mommy  gets the bug reina you gotta because i need your advice come here oh my goodness uh you know sometimes  when you do crowd work you you or you're you know dealing with an audience there's a fine line 
[03:15:00]  there's a very fun and last week well i'll wait till bonnie gets back because i like to get uh  what do you call it feedback i like to get feedback on uh what she thinks of the situation that's what  i'm trying to say oh we haven't even talked about my new tattoo well mommy's gonna come now the bug is 
[03:15:30]  gone so you gotta scram the bug is gone beat it say say hi to everybody and go hi everybody i gotta  run tell me you gotta run because people like you i gotta run i mean you have a lot of fans there are  some anti-reina people out there there's a couple anti-reina people what do you have to say what do  you have to say to the people that aren't fans of yours huh i don't want to hear you what do you want  to say to them kiss my what grits what do you want to say to those kiss my bonnie mom kiss your 
[03:16:00]  bonnie mom get out of here i love you bye see she doesn't she doesn't she her brain can't even  conceptualize that there's people that don't like her she's like i love you all okay so there's a fine  line you you feel bad like i was i don't know if i was mean to the guy i asked you about with the  patch on his eye last week in the audience i thought that was funny i felt bad though sometimes  i feel bad i think a patch on the eye is less upsetting than like if you're making fun you'd 
[03:16:30]  make fun of somebody bald you'd make fun of someone fat no i don't i don't go after fat unless it's a  guy once in a while like i almost said a fat joke this guy said one if there's a woman that's fat and  like heckling well dinner she's heckling she's fair game shut your fat mouth oh my god shut your fat  mouth i mean can't you let her have a little bit of leeway no because you don't heckle all right  but i think honestly i think 99 of the heckles are are people that are in good spirits that are 
[03:17:00]  just that's they it's fun to them i don't think that they're being for the most part people aren't  being mean when they heckle what i really don't believe they're interrupting if it's a progressive  interruption i get upset but if they're just if it's a once or twice thing i don't mind it at all  yeah sometimes i don't mind it either it's you got to feel it out but i don't attack if i don't mind  if i mind i attack oh do you understand sometimes you don't give a warning signal yeah yeah i do hey 
[03:17:30]  shut up or be quiet or you know take another bite of your food eat up you know you won't be like  if you heckle again i'm you leave me no option but to make fun of your size  no i would never i don't really go after weight i i was almost said something to this guy he was  real big in the front row and i could see his face trying to get sad so i backed away and i made him  like me uh size is tough i used to do a joke where i'd say like i was perfect like my size but it was 
[03:18:00]  a joke i mean this is too complicated to explain but always the fat women in the eyes would really  size me up and be like hmm like the worst the worst you know you people get upset like if you go after  like if you say something to a fat person but what about when you say something to a skinny i think i  talked about this what about when you say something to a skinny person well you're you you can say things  to skinny people because they're um that's the goal we're all trying to get to unless you say they're 
[03:18:30]  anorexic then you've crossed the line and people get very very upset about that because that's a  disorder want to hear one of my earlier jokes about eating disorder yeah i mean this is back with the  rest area and and can i just say this the reason people get so mad about anorexia is because people  die from anorexia well people die from uh overeating well right but so if you made fun of someone for  being fat or whatever just keeping it with their looks they'd be upset but if you if you say something 
[03:19:00]  about them having like diabetes or some you know they're gonna have a heart attack or something then  you're crossing into a line that people don't like when i hear one of my old jokes i would love to  oh it wasn't about wait oh another old one uh my ex-girlfriend had a high blood pressure and false teeth  so every now and then i'd send her a box of salt water taffy get it high blood pressure salt false 
[03:19:30]  teeth taffy i get it i i want to be supportive i'm not sure that was in the first two or three years  i just don't get like because you didn't like her does the yeah is the setup like after we broke up i  would say yeah oh okay that makes more sense i could give you a couple more old ones i thought i was  like a steven right that one maybe we should just move on no let me give you this one okay i bought  a wood stove oh i i told you that one when you said i'm gonna tell you no joke i was gonna be like

[03:22:30]  i did too you did not i did too because i knew if i didn't ask you and i booked it you would get mad  no i wouldn't get mad so i ask you and i go like this i hope we're working no i didn't good but  also i one of the reasons that i ask if you're working uh that night is because there is a slim  possibility that i won't have to get a babysitter and you could stay home but that would never happen  yeah it would happen not but i'm working i would love to stay would you have stayed at home yes or 
[03:23:00]  would you have been freaking out that you didn't that i didn't book you no but here's what here's what it  is sometimes i like to go in new york and hang out i'm working so much on the road and in the day i  know but you can't do everything that's the point you can't do everything uh i felt bad with the guy  with the eye patch okay let's move on and oh this week you're doing plugs hey what about amazon we i  think we're people are buying stuff from amazon under our uh under our uh advertisements that we're

[03:24:00]  there you go do you want full hair and makeup but really they just like finger  tousle your hair that's all they do well you know uh i have a new tattoo everyone knows about it my  no i didn't talk about it last week you did yes we did because i said you have a woman on your arm if  i had a guy on my arm would you be upset you were like no no i wouldn't oh that was during the podcast  no i wouldn't be mad i wouldn't be mad you wouldn't be mad if i went and got a tattoo of a guy 
[03:24:30]  if you got a sailor here okay here like boom boom boom boom boom watch this this is a pinup girl  with no nobody that you could even pinpoint it's just a pinup girl so if you went out so then all  those times that you were saying it's you i got him to do you you know i was joking i said it one  time don't act like i said it all those times reina too joking reina knows oh god oh god you don't know  a joke when you hear one you're why don't you email me and say as a professional you think you'd 
[03:25:00]  be able to communicate to another professional that it is a joke but you were unable to do  oh really this is really you look at the size of her bosoms so if you got like a sailor on your arm  a nondescript sailor do you think that would bother me not at all you know what's good about me  is that my family has left me almost zero emotional feeling towards anything so when you  say mean things to me i just fucking don't care i don't say it doesn't hurt at all i don't say that 
[03:25:30]  see oh really you're look at her bosoms how big they are they're gigantic really i don't like big  bosoms i'm gonna get a fucking tattoo of a sailor on my arm with a huge cock i'm not it's not even a  huge i'm gonna probably gonna just slightly above average and then i'm gonna go but look i'm gonna it's  not news look at the size of his cock oh so you're saying i'm below average no i'm saying  your average oh that's good that's good average is good average is good for someone your size and  weight sure good see you think that's i'm mean but you're mean i'm only mean back i'm not mean 
[03:26:00]  you're a mean person i'm funny and i'm you're mean that's mean like first of all that's mean  because one you have a perfect body and you know it that is gross i do not stop oh come on you say  it on stage you just said how you said it it's obviously a joke that's what my point is i wouldn't  really say i have i wouldn't just go on stage and be like i have a perfect body and then tell 
[03:26:30]  jokes i didn't have anything to do with that you used to do that all the time hey girls don't you wish  you were me and then you would move on no that is such a lie no no i'm i'm i'm filled with um  self-loathing so there's no way that you want to hear another old joke here's another one do eskimos  put their money in snow banks do you think you made that up yeah i did that 2020 well then 
[03:27:00]  aliens came in reverse time why and made that joke from the turn of the century that joke is not  or maybe in canada that could be a canadian joke because you guys have eskimos and snow  oh oh rich boss my father told me one time he goes why do you know my mom had a leather coat that  she wouldn't wear out in the range he goes well look at the cows they got leather they're out in the  rain and then that was a jerry seinfeld joke yeah well it's parallel thinking or do you think jerry

[03:31:00]  would anyone else give money for a guy that picked up a billfold outside i would i do yeah the guy was  honest and he should be if you just if you saw someone drop their wallet and you went oh here you  you dropped your wallet would you expect them to give you money no but it was but you gave him  money and then that wasn't in the wallet it was in just every time i ask you for money it's a  fucking ordeal you start with a one i don't anytime you ask me i've never said no to you in my whole  not with your lips i've never said no to you with my lips what are you talking about

[03:32:30]  he's writing the book how's it coming interestingly you should ask me i gave um  the first uh hundred pages to two of my friends to see what their responses would be and they were  very very positive like very positive and they both were like what does rich think of it what does rich  think of it i'm gonna wait to the end i'm not gonna sit and read it now you gotta wait i said  he hasn't even ever asked about it and then here you asked about it i think about every time last 
[03:33:00]  night i said something about trying to think of a story and you go why like every time i say i have  to do some writing what are you writing like it's always like such a mind-boggling thing uh no because  you write so many different things so i don't know which one you're working on what project i brag to  everybody you got a book deal i told uh who did i tell yesterday you got a book deal scott rudin  no is that his first name it's not such a big deal it's like you start when you once you get a book  deal you realize like everyone's got a book deal that's not true the only two people i know to have 
[03:33:30]  a book deal are you and our mailman those are the only two yeah i told one of the ladies at the pool  and she was like i i gotta get a book deal i've got an interesting life oh here's dorosa calling uh  hello hello would you like to we're doing our podcast would you like to talk on speakerphone  okay hold on hold on folks we have a special guest hold on let's see hello can you hear me 
[03:34:00]  all right speak up it seems that you're quite upset with the business right now which so am i  and so is bonnie because that's what we were talking about uh we're more upset with the the uh  today we're more upset with the audience than with the business end and what audience and you know 
[03:34:30]  we're talking about our audience how what fucking babies they are ours we were talking about yours okay  mine but what are you upset with if you would like to to share oh well guys first of all hi bonnie how  are you hi dorota good um i couldn't hear what you said to be honest with you i thought i just assumed  you said how are you oh yeah yeah we hear you perfect bonnie didn't say how are you she was rude and 
[03:35:00]  i apologize for bonnie well it's not the first time you've had to do that rich let's be honest  remember that time we sent you a text that said you were i sent you a text that said uh rich and i  were talking and you're our favorite friend in the whole world and then you wrote back oh and then i  wrote back oh whoops wrong person yeah i don't remember that do you remember the time that you 
[03:35:30]  i thought like you just wrote whoops wrong person after i said ah and then like when i realized like  oh no they only texted me the favorite person they need to say wrong person afterwards it was totally  insulting at that point where there was like no sentiment in it whatsoever do you remember when you  texted us to wish us happy merry christmas  yeah what did you say bonnie i said go fuck yourself 
[03:36:00]  i don't i don't remember but there's a reason i don't text you merry christmas anymore  uh we've had a lot of ups and downs my friend  into this fucking business today completely what's yeah um  because uh i'm down in philadelphia which is where i'm from as you guys know 
[03:36:30]  and uh for the third fucking time that i've been down here uh for some reason the president  speed radio show who is the number one uh there's a number one show in philly i guess  um on a very you know popular rock station here called who has every comic that comes from philly on  this show and used to have me on regularly and they were very welcoming to me and they liked me quite a  bit because for some reason uh decided they don't ever want to have me on their show anymore and 
[03:37:00]  now this is the uh third time that i have uh needed to go on the show uh two of the two of the three  times were uh for for specifically to plug performances in philadelphia and they said no it passed on me  they absolutely know what their affiliation to the club that i'm playing is they absolutely know what it 
[03:37:30]  means to go on to that show and push your dates when you're in town they understand all of it they  they get exactly what it means when they say no you can't come in here and push your dates and as a result  of it uh ticket sales are down uh and you know what am i supposed to do that's like i'm furious right now  well here's the here's here's how i look at one it in the long run it's all bullshit because when 
[03:38:00]  you're a fucking major major act which you will be because you're funny enough and and you're clever  enough and i'm not just saying that you know i always say that and that's what i think that it's  all bullshit because one uh i mean or two it's the summer too you know july getting people in a club  unless you're fucking you know billy burr or or above it's almost you know it's almost impossible 
[03:38:30]  you know what why do you have to say billy burr to him why that's who he wants to be oh well whatever  uh she's just a mean person that's and that's why we're getting divorced huh  i can't hear anything honestly i can't hear what bonnie's saying and whatever filter  or frequency problem that's making it happen i wish it was always that way on our voice  yes okay uh sometimes i don't know what goes on you know with radio last time i was in philly 
[03:39:00]  pressing and steven and put me on because they were having the intern olympics which i'm sure is very  important uh you know not to have me there uh you know making jokes about it or talking about it  because i'm sure it's serious and and whatever you know and i and a lot of times with radio it's not  personal we take it as comics personal we take it personal but it's not always personal it might not 
[03:39:30]  be personal but they might be booked up this week or they might you know whatever i don't think it's  personal because i don't i've never done radio with you where you didn't kill on radio so i i really  would think it's not a personal thing because you always kill on radio that's i appreciate that thank  you and uh and it means a lot coming from you but but here's the thing that's why i think it's personal  i never did a bad job on their show i did a good job every time i went in there and they liked me 
[03:40:00]  they were chasing me like like the last couple times i went in to do it there's that delosa hot  pitch laugh ah we love it we were really starting to power around they were letting me go on whenever  i needed to when i was in town and then all of a sudden three consecutive times in a row dude in which it's  not like small shit it was like i had a book come out they passed and i was like that's weird then i 
[03:40:30]  was doing a week week uh a couple of weeks and i did helium and they said next time and i was like  that's weird they just put the helium guys on now i'm headlining a full weekend of helium and they're  passing again shut us up man shut us up and i knew after the last words on the show i left and i was like  man they kept me waiting for a long time and then they had me on for five minutes and like rush me 
[03:41:00]  out the door and i was like something doesn't feel right something feels weird it didn't feel welcoming  something feels weird and look i'm convinced that i know there's some like and it's hearsay or whatever  i don't know exactly what it is but it's like i i almost positive they have some kind of history  with uh with ona and now they're like doing this like no he's one of the ona guys so he can't come  in at least that's what i thought but but i know you're going on and i think they can have anybody 
[03:41:30]  jimmy on and stuff haven't they i i don't know about i know i've done it but i mean i had a a fallout  with them kind of uh because i was doing kid chris and i and i smashed them for not having me on  but then the next time they brought me in and we kind of squashed it uh so you know with radio you  never know what one second you know it's like project runway one second you're in the next second  you're out you know what i mean and uh how does she say it how does heidi klum say it bonnie uh 
[03:42:00]  uh one second on project runway how did she say it one minute you're in the next you're out okay  thank you so it could be one day you're in one day what you should do is either have if you if you're  working with a publisher just have them find out what the problem is or have the owner of the club  call talk to them say look you know uh you know he's the one who who benefits too 
[03:42:30]  maybe he could find out what the problem is and then third choice or is maybe you could find  you know email email one of the producers and find out if there's a problem huh  i did i emailed i emailed my contact over there one of those apprentices and i guess the book  of this guy casey i do know i emailed him and i was very respectful email just like dude like  if i did anything to offend you guys please i assure you i'm unaware of it and i apologize 
[03:43:00]  if i did i go we were on the way to establishing a really great webinar which is why i was so  surprised when i came to come to such a rough stop like like is something going on it's like the third  or four times you guys have passed away uh well if he did he like i like how he was really respectful  but he started his email with dude did they did they did he respond to you did the guy respond 
[03:43:30]  right now right now no well here's what i would do i would send you know have maybe meredith find  out or or send them a uh a fish isn't that how they do it how does the mom do it do they send  look at this yeah yeah well and you i don't know man i'm just you know it just bothers me because  it's like i'm just sick of this resistance that comes every goddamn turn it's like dude i'm just  trying to i'm just trying to do a good weekend silly it's where i'm from i just want to have good 
[03:44:00]  shows i want to get the word out to people i just want to have good shows i'm not trying to milk  anybody for anything i'm not trying to overstep my balance i'm not trying to overstay my welcome  i just want to have good shows down here and well you're gonna have you at the very least  at the very least you need the same fair shake that everybody else gets that good shows  okay it's like when you don't even get that it goes beyond like it goes beyond where am i going to end 
[03:44:30]  up in this business you're like they're like what what i'm what's you know one day i hope i make  it all that stuff because the oddity of that now it's just like what am i a  fucking chump like why the fuck don't i get the same opportunity that every other  fucking guy that comes to this club gets you know it's not the club's fault you know these guys are  fucking you know and it's obvious like we're already up against the hurdle of summertime you  know it just fucking sucks man like you know a lot of a lot of times these radio shows shows also 
[03:45:00]  on friday do uh you know the wet t-shirt contest which may be a reason you can't get in but i'll tell  you the truth i would think open anthony has such a big draw in in in philly that you have  to do ona and if they don't book i would have but i was gone i was down here all week with my  family so i couldn't go into ona well call it whatever i would have done that obviously yeah 
[03:45:30]  i would call him just call into ona i mean our podcast is very big so you're going to get about  four people from this to come to helium to see you and well i i listen the bottom line is it's if you  you think about it at the end of the day what the fuck do you know how many people have said no to  you and me you know how many nose all the fucking nose today i just looked at you know our movie 
[03:46:00]  you know our our our rep you know sends it out and eight more nose came in okay but here's the good  thing he's sending it to these people that i would have never got it to okay so we still have  probably 30 more chances or 20 you know what i'm saying you know and people that are saying no  are like lionsgate weinstein so every if every one of those motherfuckers say no but one says yes that's 
[03:46:30]  all all we need you know what i mean so in this business that you know as well as i do  you're gonna hear no's all all you hear no no no no no no no but guess what you're doing what you  love you're good at what you do fuck them you do what you do and that one yes is going to come  along and boom you see what i'm saying  yeah i see what you're saying so you know one fucking yes 
[03:47:00]  good advice good advice it's just you know just fucking infuriates me  and now i'm just kind of all the sense about like do i should i go on i i i'm thinking about  trashing it in every show they say well if you want to if you want to end the relationship  completely but you don't know down the line what the fuck you might need them for you might have  another book come out or your your when your next cd comes out you know who the fuck knows i mean 
[03:47:30]  i i don't know i don't know what to tell you uh you know that's on you  no i never but i never was in there ever once that was before i ever went in with them and i  you know i was doing kid chris all the time in in philly and then there was something that happened  and they can't i just i don't know what i was it was fucking probably the one of the funniest radio 
[03:48:00]  appearances i've ever had in my life and i just went in there and they just said don't bring up the  kid chris thing you know he was i think he was out of philly that's my problem what happened is and  then he got fired from philly so of course i always picked a losing team but somehow uh i got on with  them i got on with them and i did them like three or four times maybe but then the last time i was in  they said no and i just you know and you know what am i going to do i i did o and a and i did the bella 
[03:48:30]  uh you know it's just it is what it is you you know if you if you're you know the bottom line is  as fucking comics they put the pressure on us to get the fucking people in okay isn't enough that we  have to do the show and and be creative how about maybe some of these places step it up spend a little  more fucking money on advertisement and you guys get the people in and i promise i'll deliver okay like in 
[03:49:00]  the old days before there was the fucking internet and all the social when artists when artists jobs  were to deliver okay so how about that i'm doing a place next week you know besides the radio i've  already done i got to answer a dumb questionnaire you know a questionnaire whatever i can't even say  it but you know what i mean i like it sounds so old-fashioned but you know you you just want to  be creative you don't need these fucking obstacles and you don't need to put these negative obstacles 
[03:49:30]  in your head when it's just nothing you could do so you know what i'm saying  no i hear you i hear you and don't please don't get me wrong like the club has given me no worries  about it whatsoever like i talked to the owner he's like i know that this is a shit weekend it's july  i had to hang up on him he's starting to get on my nerve what he's starting to bother me
