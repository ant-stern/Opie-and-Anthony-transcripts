<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week" countdown, interspersed with advertisements and promotions for segments like "Weird Medicine" with Dr. Steve (covering topics such as smelly feet and penile cancer), and featuring plugs for AdamandEve.com, Carbonite, Bistrictin weight loss, and It's Just Lunch.  Dr. Steve's in-studio appearance included a graphic, sexually suggestive demonstration of a prostate exam using a model and stand-up comedian Eliza Schlesinger. This led to discussions about prostate exams, medical terminology, and crude jokes.  Mike Buschetti, Artie Lange's announcer, joined, sharing stories of childhood bullying and connecting it to the NFL bullying scandal. A phone call with Colin Quinn discussed a planned road trip with Bobo, a production staff member described as being "on the spectrum," further fueling absurd banter.

The show then transitioned into a brainstorming session for a cross-country road trip, potentially involving Bobo and Colin Quinn, to be filmed for a web series or show segment.  Discussions covered potential sponsors (Audi, Sunoco), the inclusion of female crew members (Eliza's attractiveness was specifically noted), and increasingly absurd trip ideas (visiting farms, abandoned Detroit buildings, potentially encountering a Mexican drug cartel). The planned Los Angeles finale was debated extensively, with suggestions ranging from visiting movie studios to staging a prank. The conversation became chaotic and inconclusive, followed by more advertisements and a pre-recorded interview with John C. McGinley, who discussed his acting techniques and experiences with Oliver Stone, including a unique script-preparation method involving juggling.

A significant portion of the show focused on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's crack cocaine admission, analyzing audio clips from a city council meeting and press conference.  The clips highlighted Ford's responses regarding drug use, alleged crack house visits, and confrontational exchanges with council members. His brother, Doug Ford, attempted a unique defense.  The hosts speculated on the political ramifications and public reaction. Mike Tyson was expected to appear later.

Mike Tyson's in-studio interview followed, promoting his book "Undisputed Truth" and HBO show.  He discussed his difficult childhood, violence, poverty, bullying, and self-destructive behaviors, using explicit language and graphic descriptions of his past. He detailed his misogynistic views and reflections on his past actions, even recounting a method for sexual encounters in prison.

The show concluded with a highly informal segment featuring Jim Norton, Bailey Jay, and other guests including Bobby Kelly, and women from the audience, and a man identified as Matt Bailey.  The conversation involved numerous vulgar jokes and sexually charged banter.  The discussion centered on dildos, penis size comparisons, blowjobs, and sexual acts, with a dildo being passed around the studio and a "dick-sucking competition" taking place between two male guests, Lewis and Bailey J., judged by audience applause.  Further explicit conversations and jokes, including commentary on Bailey Jay's appearance, speculation about Louis CK's sexuality, and discussions about dildo size, punctuated the final segment.  Numerous commercial breaks occurred throughout this final section.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Call it the worst, wait it, and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what?  Sidney, face.  Hi kids, welcome to the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Every weekend here on the Opie and Anthony channel, counting down the best things that  happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  My name is Sam Roberts and we've got a lot to cover, so let's get into it.  Mike Tyson returned to the studio, the ballad of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford.  John McGinley was here.  Mike Buschetti made his return to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  A phone call from Colin Quinn.  Before we get to any of that, Dr. Steve made a visit to the studio.  He hasn't been in the studio in over a year.  I don't know how long it's been.  He does a show on the channel called Weird Medicine, but he brought with him this model  that allows you to perform prostate exams because he wanted people to feel what it felt like  for him to give prostate exams.  Eliza Schlesinger, the very attractive female stand-up comedian, was in studio at the same 
[00:01:00]  time and got to get her hands on the prostate model.  We've got Eliza Schlesinger outside the studio with Dr. Steve.  What?  Maybe you guys could slow down a seat like on the Paul Carson show.  Maybe she could figure the prostate thing.  We absolutely should get her to figure the prostate thing.  Maybe Sam could put his beat thing down.  Let's break that shit out again there, Dr. Steve.  Put something up there like an M-80, though, and tell her that's what happens. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, like an M-70.  They blow up.  No one would find funny that he had to fucking travel with that thing for 10 minutes on the radio.  In the airport.  What a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  It says prostate on it.  They sell for $1,200.  I got this one for $200 on eBay.  Yes.  And it looks it, by the way.  It's coming.  It looks like it.  Right.  Can't you just go to fucking one of those porn stores and get one of those bottoms-up fuck things and a rock?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just cut a fucking plumbing house. 
[00:02:00]  Good.  How are you?  Good.  I remember you.  Good.  Jeez, that's good.  That's a good intro.  No, because there are some times I hear a name, right?  And I go, I remember that.  I've only been here like three times.  Yeah.  Has it been three?  I think so.  I bet one time I wasn't here.  She's like a regular now.  But I remember it because I found you very attractive.  Is this happening?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I did.  Thank you.  Could Dr. Steve break out what he brought?  She's got to see this, really.  It's a pack.  Does a prop ever work twice in one shot?  No, I think she would like to see it. 
[00:02:30]  That's right.  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.  Like a real doctor or like an English doctor?  Yeah.  No, I'm not.  He hated that.  He's like, no.  Just relax.  But it is true.  If you need Valtrex, he's your man.  I'm a doctor.  Yes.  Okay.  Like there's no reason.  Who doesn't?  There's no reason.  Who doesn't at this point?  Someone should be able to call themselves a doctor if they're a doc, not a doctor, a medical  doctor.  They take it so seriously, though.  It's like there's two words for something that means completely different things.  Like, oh, I'm a doctor.  You have a doctorate. 
[00:03:00]  You're not a doctor.  Right.  Right.  But they, like, you ever met, like, an English professor?  They're dicks.  I am a doctor.  Don't you wish that someone would have a heart attack, like, in general, but like on a plane?  That's a doctor.  Well, I do know the prologue from the Canterbury Tales.  Fuck you.  That's not going to bring him back.  But he's doing God's work.  He's kind of like an angel of death type of person.  Oh, like a Kevorkian kind of thing?  Well, without the pillow.  We stay away from that word?  Not the pillow?  No, it's okay.  He's like a hospice guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  So I do hospice and palliative care, but I do. 
[00:03:30]  Palliative care.  Yeah.  They even.  Screeching hollow.  No, he's like the Patch Adams of the hospice.  He runs in with fucking toe tags.  Is he here for you?  I wish he was.  Merciful.  Who was the ghoul that came up with the word?  What?  The word could have been a little like.  Palliative.  Palliative care.  Yeah, it sounds horrendous.  It's from the Latin root, paliare, which means to cloak.  Oh, so you are an English doctor.  To cloak.  Palliative.  It means you're friends.  Wait, so what did you bring?  Did you bring a cloak?  No, no, no.  See, I'm also a family practitioner, and I do a little radio show that's a medical show. 
[00:04:00]  He's downplaying.  His podcast is really good.  You should do it.  Oh, yeah.  The first time I ever came here, they asked me what it's like to do a prostate exam, and  then they made me do one on one of their interns, and then it became a recurring bit  until I finally did it.  He did a homeless guy once.  I did one on a homeless guy.  Who had rocks in his underwear from shit that petrified.  Are you serious?  Yeah, it was terrible.  I swear to God.  And I declared him the healthiest guy.  I'm so glad I came here.  The healthiest guy in the room, and then a year later, he was dead.  So that's how good that was.  Well, you were trying to help him out, but we got you guys together a little too late 
[00:04:30]  in his life.  Can you give you, this is a real question.  Can you give yourself a prostate exam?  Oh.  Yeah, you can.  You have to have kind of long fingers like me.  So like black dudes could do it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, like Dr. J.  You got to be a bit Arsenio.  You got to be a bit agile, too.  It's a little hard to reach all the way around.  I can't be my tumbo.  No problem with that.  Because you got to go around the taint to get in there.  Well, you got to go between the legs, like this.  You go on your back and throw your legs, throw your knees.  Is taint a medical term?  I think I could do it.  Well, it's...  Well, I am doing it. 
[00:05:00]  It's actually called the perineum.  The perineum?  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought that was a type of flower.  Oh, my God.  Perineum.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, smell them.  All right.  Break it out.  You want me to break it out?  Yeah, why not?  Just for a second.  You know.  You guys have already seen whatever he's about to do?  Yeah.  Jimmy used it.  Not, you know, well, I'm going to say...  This is a prostate.  Oh, my God.  See, that's why...  You got to see it.  You did it?  All right.  This is how they practice prostate.  No pictures of this.  Is it prostate or prostrate? 
[00:05:30]  Prostate.  Tate.  There's no R in there, right?  No.  I fucked that one up.  Well, there's an R at the beginning of the word.  No, I know.  But not where I thought it would be.  There is a word prostrate, but it means something else.  Prostate.  There's proselytize.  I have a question.  Want to try it?  Okay.  When you...  Okay.  You need gloves.  I don't know if try is the word as much as do it again.  When you graduate medical school, you shake with one hand, and then do you get a diploma  or this with another hand?  Slap that in your hand.  Isn't that pretty fucked up?  Why do I need a glove?  Like, it's not a real thing.  No.  For effect?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Now, what he does is he slides in various prostates.  I have different prostates.  This one has a little nodule on it in the...  You're supposed to feel it.  But don't tell me which one you're putting in.  Okay, okay.  Well, now I already saw it.  Well, yeah, now you've got to mix it up.  Mix it up.  Come on.  Ah.  It's like fucking disgusting asshole three-card Monty.  He might not have mixed it up.  The answer is prostate nodule.  Is that your lunch, Jim?  Yeah, I'm going to have some avocado, too.  No, she's talking about the fucking ass torso. 
[00:06:30]  Whenever he pulls out the prostate thing, I have to eat almonds because it reminds me  of the little nodules that he felt earlier.  It's disgusting.  Is the prostate in?  It's in.  It's in.  Okay.  Explain what she has to do, though.  She's disgusting.  I hate this.  She's disgusting.  I wanted to be one of the boys, and now I realize being one of the boys is super gross.  I get it.  You guys are super gross.  Hey, you're not going to get an embarrassing heart on.  Don't feel bad.  I have some explaining to do.  A little lube on this finger.  Okay.  Oh.  Is it both?  No, just one.  Jesus.  No, it's got to be the index. 
[00:07:00]  I thought it was two.  No.  No.  That's only if you're lucky.  Maybe for...  What do I do?  Just put it in?  Do I have to massage the balls?  Do I have to massage the balls first?  Just to get them ready?  Yes, mine.  And lick my lips.  Dad, I'm sorry you're listening.  Yeah, your pad is down.  Your finger...  The prostate will be down.  Your fingerprint down.  Okay.  So you do your fingerprint down.  Lube the asshole first.  What are you doing?  You're just dry rubbing it.  Oh, now she's rubbing lube on Jimmy.  Why did I listen to you?  Why did I listen?  Why did I listen? 
[00:07:30]  We're trying to get a show on network television.  This is probably not the way to go about doing it.  What's this bump in the front?  He has...  Is this like...  Is this his ovary?  No, that's his...  Oh, fuck.  I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  But why is there...  Is there ridge?  Well, the ridge...  The sphincter muscle.  Is this his stimulus package?  The sphincter muscle.  Put your finger all the way in.  All the way in.  You've got to go...  You feel kind of a rubbery walnut with a seam down the middle.  Yeah.  And if you feel way up on the upper right-hand corner, you'll feel a nodule.  You've got to keep your finger down. 
[00:08:00]  I don't think my finger is bigger than that.  It's not long enough.  Mine was either.  So you're turning it up, so it's going to be down.  Yeah.  It's down.  But down, I get...  Is this a sponge?  Yeah, that's a nodule.  Is it like styrofoam?  I missed the nodule.  No, that's the actual part.  Steve, make sure it's in there, right?  If your finger's not long enough, use your tongue.  Yeah.  Put your peck on that.  Oh, okay.  It wasn't because I was touching styrofoam, which, as we all know, is a part of the main  lower intestine.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  You are routing around in there. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I hit gold.  Do you ever grab the penis for leverage?  Just pull him towards you with it.  Fucking tie it off on your wrist.  You would have a great crunch if that thing could shoot, like, fucking shampoo out.  Oh, yeah.  After I'm back to New Jersey, just soaking wet with final juice.  There's a bump.  I found it.  Now we need the scalpel.  Oh, man.  You're going to cut it out.  So what do you do now that, how do you break it to him that he has ass roids? 
[00:09:00]  You know, well, the next step to do in that person's prostate would be to, oh, you're  pushing me up.  That's very forceful.  Oh, yeah.  That'll make a cough.  Put the other one in.  A prostatic biopsy.  Oh.  And the prostatic biopsy is loads of fun.  The way they like to do it now is they take a probe and stick it up your asshole, and  then it's got a little needle.  Wait, hold on.  It's a medical jargon.  Dumb it down.  It goes right through the intestinal wall.  It goes up the rectum, and it goes through, because the front part of the rectum is the 
[00:09:30]  back part of the prostate.  That's what I went through.  And then this needle punches through the rectum part of the prostate.  Yeah, then you feel like you have to shit and pee for 12 straight hours.  I look at how my hand is still in here.  Yeah, yeah.  You're just like, oh, wait.  It's not a dam that's breaking.  You can relax.  Wear like a muff when you leave.  When they do that, what is in the colon that you don't want in your bloodstream and in  your prostate?  Shit comes cold.  Shit comes cold.  Oh, Lord.  Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  One of my best friends had this done, and he ended up in the hospital.  Do I go in?  Oh, man.  What am I feeling for?  Do I go in?  Well, just feel and see what you feel.  See if you feel something different.  It's a lobster, a live lobster.  All right.  It's hard.  Oh, yeah.  What is that supposed to be?  Like a toy?  Stage four prostate cancer.  Isn't he a treat?  You just got so serious.  Yeah, no kidding.  Like a lot of meat or something.  Can you go with the stage two thing? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, she was at stage two of the first one.  So this is...  All right.  That's kind of what it feels like.  How does it get this bad?  Well, you don't get your prostate checked when you show up.  How often should people get their prostates checked?  You know, we recommend...  Once every hour.  Depending on how horny you are.  Depending on how horny you are.  Yeah, there's those little doctor's offices.  They look like glory holes, and you put your asshole against it.  Doctor...  What if Obamacare covers glory holes?  There's always a doctor on the other side.  You could cut your finger on that.  Like, that's like a piece of coal. 
[00:11:00]  Well, it's a simulator, but it does...  He's been a bad boy for Christmas.  He's been a lot of coal up his ass.  Exactly.  You get a lump of satin pillow in your stocking.  Because you're dead.  This guy has a small penis.  Right?  Yeah, I feel bad for him.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, sure he does.  When you're bent over the table, you do tend to get a little shrinkage.  What depends on what you...  That's true, true, true.  The doctor's sticking a finger up your ass.  Is there more?  Is there more for me to touch?  No, that's...  Okay.  Those are the two biggies, right?  You never fucked with each other in medical school?  Like you stick, like... 
[00:11:30]  No.  Like a kitten in there?  That's stage five.  Stage five is adorable.  You need to have this checked out meow.  Meow.  Check out.  I have an interesting lab, though.  Let's go for a cat scan.  Wow, your prostate gives me paws.  All right.  We get it.  I love that.  We get it.  He says...  I can't get enough of that.  I love cat.  What's your lab about that you just brought up?  I heard you. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, we...  Oh, thank you.  You got an interesting lab.  It's a nose and throat lab where we would take fiber optic scopes and run them into each  other's nose, and you would do it to...  An endoscopy.  I've had one.  Wow.  It's the worst.  Yeah, and they had this blue liquid that you would saturate these cotton pledgets with,  and we'd have to shove them up each other's nose to dilate the nose.  Well, it turns out, that stuff is cocaine.  Now, I use this other stuff called phenylephrine now, but at the time, they were using cocaine,  and we didn't know, and we didn't know we shouldn't shove 10 cotton pledgets up each 
[00:12:30]  other's nose.  Oh, nice.  We shouldn't do it, you know, every single time.  Wow.  And by the end of the day, you know, we were just rocking around.  Because I've got some ideas, we've got to write this shit down, you know, who wants  to go?  Look what I'm doing with the prostate ass.  I feel awesome.  Medical school's going to be great.  I had a friend in my class that, after that, conspired to break into the lab to steal, say  he didn't do it, but he came after one time.  That shit will make you do it.  Just one time, he was ready to give up everything. 
[00:13:00]  Jesus.  The mayor of Toronto proved that it was cocaine, or they knew it.  We didn't know, and we were medical students, so they just said, put this blue stuff on these  things and shoving them out of each other's nose.  They didn't tell us we should just do it once.  So every time we would go back and forth doing the scopes on each other, we'd shove them  back up there again.  But even once is like a good...  Yeah, it was good.  Right?  You guys are doing gummers.  So I've done pharmaceutical cocaine once in my life, and it was really...  Pre-so-l pharmaceutical.  That's hilarious.  Oh, man.  Did you get a drip, a medicinal drip in the back of your throat?  That's what coke does when you sniff it. 
[00:13:30]  It's like that medicinal, weird taste in the back.  No?  Yeah, I don't remember that.  No.  I don't remember much.  Yeah, that'll do it.  I'm going to put this guy and all my clothes off.  Can I move it away from my face?  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, there's no front.  We thought you'd like that.  Why would I...  I thought she was asking for it.  I'd carry that next to me on the plane, but put it in the seat next to me, just sitting  there.  And you'd just yell, it's all I have left of him.  Yeah, she took everything in the divorce. 
[00:14:00]  It would be funny, then, you could tell somebody when they're walking by, you'd go, would  you like to sit on my lap?  And then they could just sit on that.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Still moving.  It's the worst of the week countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  Still to come, Mike Tyson's going to be in studio.  The ballad of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford.  I keep saying the ballad.  But, you know, we're covering everything that happened with him.  John McGinley in studio.  Right now, we witness the return of a great comedian, Mike Buschetti.  He made quite an impression the first time he was on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:14:30]  Well, not the first time, but the second time.  Last time he was on the show.  So we invited him back in.  He's the announcer on Artie Lang's radio show.  And he's a pisser.  Mike Buschetti in studio here on The Countdown.  Number six.  You're a guy that's probably been bullied in your day.  Why do you say that?  What?  Why do you say that? 
[00:15:00]  I would think growing up in school, were you a larger gentleman as a kid?  What are you saying?  I'm saying he's got a few extra pounds on him, Jim.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did they call you in school there, Mike?  Oh, it started, they called me Grasshopper in the first grade.  What?  I couldn't, like, I wasn't too smart.  No, no, that's one part of it.  Oh, my God.  Well, he pauses it.  I know.  No, but.  You can't pause on this show ever.  Huh?  Oh, you weren't very coordinated. 
[00:15:30]  I was like, I'm still not really, but.  Yeah, yeah.  I was spastic.  They were laughing at me.  When you were in school, were you in ballet class?  Who cares?  I know, but they, you know.  What does Grasshopper have to do with that?  Yeah.  Just the way I would, we were supposed to do some kind of bullshit May dance in school.  I don't know.  Uh-huh.  I wasn't doing it well, and they were laughing at me, so.  Because you moved like a Grasshopper?  Can we see the dance?  Yeah, let's see the dance.  It was a dance?  No, like some kind of bullshit thing they had us do with school.  I hated school from kindergarten all over to high school.  Yeah, but what was the dance?  Wow, wow.  That's school.  Uh, I don't know. 
[00:16:00]  We had a dance with a partner, I think.  You know, like slide dance.  Like square dance?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was hard.  Swing your partner?  Things like that?  Yeah, it's been a long time, but they also, uh, what do you call it, my brothers loved  playing pranks with me growing up.  They broke my balls all the time.  They're younger than me.  Oh, yeah?  So one day.  Then how does that happen?  You're supposed to beat the shit out of your younger brothers.  I did, but.  Fucking Fredo.  But they, they, they, they, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  How did that work out for you?  No, but they would gang up on me. 
[00:16:30]  They were the same age, like a year apart.  Jesus.  So I'd have to fight two of them instead of one guy when we used to have, like, drunken  punching fights growing up.  Wow.  But, uh, no, they would, like, do things like, one time they, uh, unscrewed the light  bulb in my room and thought it was funny to throw tacks down on the floor.  They filled it with gasoline and screwed it back in.  Yeah.  That's kind of funny.  No, but you know what happened?  That's kind of funny.  I fixed their wagon really good, though, because my dad was.  Well, why'd you fix it if they did something so bad to you?  No, but they got their asses beat us.  It was so funny what happened to them, because my dad was. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's fine.  My dad was still living at home, right, at the time?  Uh-huh.  So I figured, yeah, well, we could even with these idiots, because, so I screamed at the  top of my lungs like I was having a heart attack, right?  Oh, shit.  Dad!  So he came in the room and stepped on the tacks.  Oh.  Oh, that's smart.  And then he's like, who the fuck did this?  I was like, those douche pigs did this.  Oh, man.  Oh, they got a beating.  Damn.  I mean, and also, you know, like, I was always a lazy fat kid, too, like, growing up. 
[00:17:30]  No.  Come on.  I would, like, my grandmother would, like, you know, have us do stuff.  She was like, oh, no.  Would you live in a tenement?  Not like fucking everyone's there.  No, she would, like, you know, like, have a house, and she'd be like, can you help me  paint the back stairs or whatever I'd sell?  Jesus.  On purpose, I would fuck up.  I knew I could do the job.  Could you paint my pussy with your tongue?  Holy shit.  Oh, grandma.  It's a good whitewasher.  Like, again.  No, I'd just fuck up.  I'd be like, oh, my gosh.  I'd, like, throw paint all over the place, make it look like I screwed up. 
[00:18:00]  I wouldn't know what I was doing.  Yeah, yeah.  So they got to do the work, and I got out of it.  Oh.  Yeah, but you got out of it, but at what cost?  She thought I was an idiot, really.  See?  Is that worth it?  No, no, it was worth being an idiot.  Oh, that was worth it.  Because those idiots were sweating their asses off while I was inside drinking soda, you know?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe you should have been outside not drinking all that soda.  That, again, at what cost?  Getting out of that work.  No, I remember some guys were brutal.  They would, like, throw, like, sand fleas on my bed one time. 
[00:18:30]  What?  Sand fleas?  Where did they get that?  Believe me, they got all kinds of shit growing up.  Your novelty shop?  Yeah, yeah.  You can find sand fleas for your little prank.  Here's some sand fleas.  Right.  Sand fleas and fake vomit.  Have a good time, boys.  If you have sand fleas, you need this elixir.  Some new rejuvenation liniments.  Yeah.  Liniments.  Wow.  Fuck.  Sand fleas.  Yeah, they like breaking balls.  And they had me...  That's not breaking balls.  That's right.  Blatant abuse. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  That's child abuse.  Yeah, that's abuse.  Why didn't they like you?  They just were jerk-offs growing up.  They, you know...  So how does it make you feel about this whole NFL bullying, then?  Are you on the...  They said it's locker room culture.  I know.  This is something that just happens.  It's part of football.  It's part of the locker room jock culture thing that people don't understand.  They see it as being cruel and obnoxious and offensive.  But it's commonplace.  No, it's...  They're taking a...  They...  These guys are football players.  They're warriors.  It's like...  They're like their own empire. 
[00:19:30]  They're gladiators.  They're out there.  They want to take your face off on the field.  They shouldn't be...  Oh, my...  My tummy's hurting me.  You know, that's bullshit, really.  Wow.  You've got to man up a little bit and take the punishment.  Well, couldn't you say the same...  That's coming from the grasshopper.  Yeah, the grasshopper who was square dancing and very uncomfortable, stepping on the poor  girl's feet.  If he can take it.  There's some girl in a wheelchair right now.  How did that happen?  When I was square dancing, sixth grade.  Yeah, she has feet like a Mad Magazine character. 
[00:20:00]  But, I mean, it's like...  But how far is it going to go after that?  I mean, you know, like, it's football now.  What are they going to do to the military one day?  I mean, you know...  Well, they were already taming down the military and saying that they can and can't do certain  things.  It's not like the old days.  It's not like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I know.  I love Gunny.  Oh, who doesn't love Gunny?  I know.  They should bring him back.  I know.  It sucks.  Choke yourself.  Those are the good old days.  Now, you know, he'd probably be sued.  No, you're right.  It's crazy.  Now, like, he cursed me.  Let's go to the office.  Right.  That's considered, like, bullying. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I know.  It's not right.  But, I mean, bring back the old days.  I miss those days.  But you were bullied in school.  How do you like that?  How do you like that?  Yeah, the old days sound terrible.  You missed the stepping on tags.  Oh, my God.  No, but you can, like, laugh.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  You missed the sand fleas.  You covered it.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  Bring back those days.  Who the fuck thinks about putting sand fleas in a bag?  The good old days.  I mean, like, I guess.  How many bites did he get from the sand fleas?  Oh, I was fucking, I looked like Alfred E. Newman. 
[00:21:00]  I'd all shit over my body.  It's like.  Fleas are brutal.  Those were the days.  Fleas suck.  They are the worst.  You can't catch them.  They're just, they're a nightmare.  But, you know, I mean, the good old days, like, when you can laugh and have fun.  I mean, like, something like the Frito Bandito.  I thought it was hilarious growing up.  Now you can't even.  Oh, you wouldn't have the Frito Bandito anymore.  No.  That was, he sold the Frito's corn chips.  It was a cartoon character called the Frito Bandito.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  No, no.  Look at me.  He's really cool.  Like, late 70s, I think.  What made him so cool?  Just the way he would.  Ay, yi, yi, yi.  I am the Frito Bandito.  Could you imagine that now?  Yeah.  What the fuck is he saying?  Yeah, no.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, they couldn't get to fucking the phone quick enough.  What are we saying?  That they wouldn't.  It was the phone's on TV now, guys.  Right.  If there was blogs back then.  This Frito Bandito is very offensive to the Mexican people.  He's violating my culture.  Yes.  They wouldn't even let the phones on TV now. 
[00:22:00]  What?  Why?  Why?  Because he'd be in hate mail for women's groups.  He'd watch his snap in his finger.  Oh, because of what he did to the Delacuisto twins or whatever the fuck.  I was trying to bang some guinea fucking twins on that show.  Pinky Tuscadero.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Roz Kelly.  I know what I'm exactly.  Why?  Yeah.  Did you like Pinky Tuscadero?  Yeah, Pinky gave me...  Leather or Pinky?  Which one?  Leather was kind of cool.  Leather did that.  Leather was cool.  She did the thing with her hands where she'd do a pew-pew thing.  Yeah, I was like... 
[00:22:30]  It's a very Bouchette-y move.  Pinky was more the older one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Leather was the younger one.  They were both ugly, though.  They didn't pick hot broads.  Oh, you're right.  They're like the 70s.  They were hot enough.  Yeah.  You know who had the worst fucking girlfriend or dates on fucking TV and should have had  better ones, but they were always a little too old for them and just very average, if  not below average looking, Jack Tripper from Three's Company.  He'd be like, oh, I got a date tonight. 
[00:23:00]  And this girl would show up and you'd be like, is this like a friend of the producer that  wanted to be on the show?  So he was never with a really attractive girl on that show.  They were always too old.  Someone the director could score with.  Yes.  Yeah, a little haggard.  But that older woman came on and got me hot.  What's that?  Mrs. fucking...  Roper?  Yeah.  Mrs. Roper.  Helen Roper.  She was hot.  Moo-moo.  Yeah.  Mike would go like, I don't know if the family's not fucking her. 
[00:23:30]  No, but I mean the other one.  Lana, I think her name.  Yeah, Lana was sexy.  Did you want to eat Laura...  What was her name?  Lindley.  Something.  Audra Lindley.  Audra Lindley.  Oh, yeah.  She was Mrs. Roper.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  You like her?  Yeah.  You know, she'd probably have a good hand job, I'm sure.  Most of you wouldn't with those fucking old weathered ring hands.  A handy from Mrs. Roper. 
[00:24:00]  You're reaching high.  Mr. Roper just sits in the corner and does that laugh thing that he used to do.  I was always mugging for the camera with that laugh.  Yeah.  Big cuckold face.  Like 1930s, like, you know.  All right, what else were we going to talk about?  The obesity in America.  Obesity.  Yes.  Well, you know, they're always talking about obesity, but they don't give us a lot of choices  when you think about it.  Now, this is a subject that's close to your heart, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little too close.  Oh, God. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, like, you know.  Oh, God.  It's like this weekend I was in Pennsylvania.  I was away, right?  Oh.  And, you know, the only thing I had was, like, fast food stuff.  So I basically.  It's hard.  Took the bread and just made myself a half a chicken thing with some.  Things.  Yeah.  I mean, I just took it and put it on the side.  Half a chicken thing.  I just took the bread.  The bread is brutal.  I haven't had bread or soda in almost three weeks now.  Whoa.  Wow.  You've got to update your Instagram, because last we looked, it was seven days. 
[00:25:00]  That's right.  I know.  What are you drinking instead of a soda?  Just a lot of water.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's good.  Water.  Come.  You've got to change it up once in a while.  Water by itself is incontinence sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  You need a little flavor in there, huh?  Wow, that's pretty good.  You lost weight.  You've noticed a difference?  I lost like nine pounds.  Yeah.  Nice.  But what about obesity?  What do you got on this?  It's hard to eat healthy, is what you're saying, when you're on the road and out there.  But you know what? 
[00:25:30]  It starts with even kids.  I mean, you see kids that are like two, three, you know what I mean?  Way, way overweight.  And their parents are like, you know, they don't have time for them.  They're like, you know, taking and replacing.  Everything's moved quick now, you know what I mean?  They're like taking all kinds of shit food and they really care, you know what I mean?  And then you've got a 200-pound kid on your hand.  How do you start?  I mean, kids.  What would you do if you had a 200-pound kid on your hand?  I'd try to get him to work out and just get him healthy if I could.  Do you work out? 
[00:26:00]  I'm going to start walking soon again.  I love the ball.  It's a good start.  I'm going to start walking soon.  It's a hell of a goal.  So you're going to trade your card in?  There's a short pier down the road.  I'm going to start walking again.  Aren't you doing that already?  Not really.  I like goals that people have.  What the hell of a goal to have?  To start walking.  I'm going to start breathing again.  You know, I just...  Forget the triathlons.  I had gone to the gym.  Fuck that bike shit.  I'm going to start walking. 
[00:26:30]  It's not I am walking.  I'm thinking about starting.  What does starting walking entail?  Just getting out of...  You know, walking past my block a little bit.  You know, then starting...  You know, starting...  I had walked for like...  I used to walk for like about an hour and a half a day where I lived.  That's nice.  But now it's...  I got lazy.  I started, you know, eating bad food and just got big, super fat like usual.  Oh, boy.  It's just...  It's the thought process, though.  It's when your brain changes everything. 
[00:27:00]  It's how you think.  It's not just the food.  Right.  Well, it's...  What about thinking about running?  Oh, God, Tom.  My knees are horrible.  Oh, yeah.  I think I would probably like...  Why are they horrible?  I have to do a lot of falling probably.  A lot of falling.  How many calories you burn falling?  I would think the getting up part is...  I don't know if they have an app for that yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you count the calories you're falling?  I think so.  I remember meeting you.  You weren't heavy.  No.  I know...  We know each other a long time.  Yeah, I am. 
[00:27:30]  How long would you say?  Oh, God.  Probably 15 years.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, we go back a long time.  And you weren't heavy.  No.  Unfortunately, I was kind of a decent-looking guy, maybe.  I don't know what...  Yeah, you were.  What the goal...  What decent is now, but...  So were you getting the ladies?  Were you putting up some numbers back then?  I made out with a couple of female guys.  Made out of a couple of female comics?  Yeah, female comics.  Which ones?  They're always known to be very pretty female comics.  But they were all open mics.  I don't even know if they're still doing...  Right.  Open micers.  Right.  I chased the open mic.  That's good.  It was cool. 
[00:28:00]  That is good.  So down at home, I'm like, you know, like...  I just thought of working with the Garciate, all kinds of shit.  You know, you got...  He was like a...  He would just be on stage in like a t-shirt.  Just like a tight t-shirt.  He was in...  Really?  You were in tight t-shirt shape?  Yeah.  Fuck, dude.  Yeah.  I know.  You know, I just turned into a blob.  Was there a moment?  Was there something that happened?  A tragedy?  Because I watched that show, Intervention and Hoarders and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  It was always some fucking thing.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  They were fine.  It's like, oh, she was fine until like the fucking dog died or something.  Sometimes women can bring you down to your knees.  That happens to me.  Well, yeah.  They're my kryptonite.  The trick is to do it the other way around.  Are you in a relationship now?  No, I just want to get some major cash and just chase whores after that.  I don't want to even bother with...  You don't want to...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I just have...  You like going with whores?  So you're thinking first you get the money, then you'll get the power.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you'll get the women.  Well, but you got to be careful with the money because like, I don't want to want to  like Mike Tyson's fucking some skank.  Well, you got to get the money before you can blow it. 
[00:29:00]  So don't worry about it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Has he been on the artist show?  No.  Oh, we should.  Yeah, come look at me now.  I'm like, oh, no, no.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  My job will be wired for like eight years now.  I was just saying one of your...  Then you'll lose weight.  I was just sent one of your Instagrams.  It's okay to be yourself as long as you're not hurting other people or yourself.  Be cool, man.  Be yourself.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be a sheep.  Be a leader.  It's okay to be yourself as long as you're not hurting other people yourself. 
[00:29:30]  That's nice.  Yeah, I believe that.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  Probably a rubber band, I guess.  I don't know.  Why are you showing the rubber band on your Instagram?  Maybe.  My wrist?  I don't know.  I got to just...  Is that like a thing where you snap the rubber band if you want...  People at OCD have that, yes.  If you want a bread or something?  If you're thinking about having bread, you snap that rubber band.  There it is.  Yeah, but I was starting Jones the other night.  Or is it a final, like a guide for a straight razor? 
[00:30:00]  I can't believe.  How was Jones the other night?  For Brad?  Yeah.  Tom?  I do that sometimes.  Not unusual to be loved by you.  I was like, I'm sleeping in bed going, my bed looks like a fucking roast beef sandwich.  What's open in the neighborhood right now?  You know what I mean?  Your bed looks like a roast beef sandwich.  I was like, fuck this.  Clean the sheets.  We don't have too many choices the way I live. 
[00:30:30]  That's not mail.  Yeah, or gravy.  Right.  Oh, shit.  I spilled gravy on the bed once.  You did?  Of course.  Of course.  Holy fuck.  I like eating on the bed.  Yeah, that's probably not a good thing.  No.  You can see the TV from there.  I don't even watch TV.  I would assume if you're eating in bed, you're not then getting up to work it off.  Yeah.  I would think like...  My wife's down there.  I'm going to get out there and walk.  Well, we heard about this.  We heard tell about this. 
[00:31:00]  That you're still talking about.  That you're...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm out walking.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's good.  You're off to a good start.  So you look like prostitutes more than regular girls?  Kind of in a way, because...  They'll fuck him.  Exactly.  They don't yell rape when it's...  What kind of prostitute do you get?  What quality?  Oh, I got to tell you, that's funny, because I got cock-blocked.  I had a fucking whorehouse with my friend years ago.  So I want a pair of glasses? 
[00:31:30]  That's funny.  That's funny.  Wow.  Thank you, James.  I got it.  He cock-blocked me, because it was this, like, really pretty girl.  And I was going to go for a...  And he grabbed her first.  I'm like, fucking idiot, taking that whore that I wanted.  You know what I mean?  I was upset by it.  Did you eat her pussy right after, or no?  No, no.  Oh, God.  What happened was...  So I took another one, like an older housewife type.  I figured, okay, I'll settle for this. 
[00:32:00]  You know, there's nothing...  I don't want to wait here all day for her now.  You know, he just fucked her, and I've got to wait for her now.  But what happened was, a few weeks later, when he, you know...  Oh, itch, trip, burn, what?  Every time he went to the bathroom, he fucking...  He was like, ah!  Oh, shit.  You know what I mean?  The doctor had to lift his prick up with a popsicle stick after that,  and then shoot him with some kind of shit.  I don't know what the hell you call it, what he got, but I was like...  Some type of sexually transmitted disease, yeah?  Yeah, just by, you know...  I was like, good, you fucking cock-blocker. 
[00:32:30]  Ah, see?  It worked out in the end.  And your housewife, when, was clean?  Uh, I think she was.  She was like...  Well, you didn't get the dick disease or anything, right?  No, but when we used to go to this place...  Jell-O coming up?  You know, after going to this place, I would put my dick in peroxide a little bit,  you know what I mean?  What?  No, just, you know...  Make the hairs blonde?  Just to clean it.  Just the bleach.  Yeah.  Just to make sure that, you know, that things are still going to work good the next day.  You think that's a good thing to do? 
[00:33:00]  Well, it's weird, because I go in a whorehouse and do not want to take a shit in the toilet  because I'm afraid of catching something.  Who shits in a whorehouse?  Why is that even an option?  It depends what you're eating on the way there.  Wait, would you actually go in there and shit before you saw a whorehouse?  No, no.  Oh, my God.  I wanted to make sure you got all that out of the way before you walked to the front door  of a whorehouse.  I'm not shitting in this fucking spanking place.  Why would you?  Nobody would shit in a whorehouse.  Have you ever shit in a whorehouse?  No.  And then you're not fresh, you know?  No, if I had to, no. 
[00:33:30]  No, but did you ever feel the urge to shit and hold it?  Yeah, but I'd rather fucking shit in the sidewalk in the middle of the day.  Wait, so you went into a whorehouse, you had to shit.  When you're walking.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  You went into a whorehouse, you had to shit.  Uh-huh.  And you went into the bathroom before you saw the whore and debated going?  No, I thought about it and I'm like, fuck, these whores are bad enough.  I don't want to catch anything on the fucking toilet, you know?  But were you going to shit before you saw one if you could?  Uh, no.  I just, but you know, some of the ones were cute though.  And this place was like in downtown, but it was only ten bucks in those days. 
[00:34:00]  Ten bucks?  But we're talking about like, Tom, like the mid-80s.  Right, right.  Everything was good in those days.  Bullying, $10 whores.  No, it was great.  Sand fleas.  But I usually stayed with one woman over there all the time.  My special.  She was like, I was like about 25 or 26.  She had to be like twice my age.  She was like housewife from Buffalo, I think.  You like older women?  A housewife, an older housewife from Buffalo.  She was stacked.  Wow.  She was stacked. 
[00:34:30]  She was stacked.  She was stacked.  That's great.  I'm like, whoa, I fucked the tits one.  It was awesome.  That fucking skank.  Yeah.  She's probably like 80 years old now though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And still fucking wiping her tits and crying in the shower.  She's still washing her tits with fucking a driveway scraper.  Well, one girl was awesome from Peru.  My name was Elena.  She was awesome.  Yeah.  What made her awesome there, Mike?  She just growled me.  She had a nice toilet.  One of those short Peruvian girls that wear the derbies with a fucking bag of coffee over 
[00:35:00]  her shoulder.  Yeah.  Thick and small.  Thick and short.  That's the way I like them.  Yeah.  She built like Hervé Villachez.  Yeah.  Perfect square.  Yeah.  Hair like Ken Burns' wig.  If she fucks up, you can thread them with a green card too.  You know what I mean?  You have to put up with any shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But she was standing there like in a red dress.  She was stacked.  I looked at her and she goes.  I love that.  She growled at me.  She goes.  So I'm like, this is my woman, baby. 
[00:35:30]  Wow.  She was a hooker?  Yeah.  And what did you do?  Did you fuck her?  Oh, God.  Jim was fantastic.  It was fucking.  I still think about her.  Did she suck your prick?  She sucked it like it was falling off me.  She was like, that little skank.  I love that saying, but it's like, she sucked it like it was falling off me.  Yeah, but then that means that your prick was falling off like a leper and she just  sucked it gently and it fell off.  No, but I just love pushing her fucking head down, grabbing her head, you know, like  like a basketball, you know?  Yes.  Like a basketball.  I don't understand why the long-term relationship hasn't worked out. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, I do.  I know.  This is.  Oh, my God.  He's a catch.  The worst of the week countdown on the Opie and Anthony Town.  Lady Gaga is here for a town hall at Sirius XM.

This is the worst of the week countdown, and we are counting down the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Still to come, Mike Tyson was in studio. 
[00:41:00]  Everything that happened with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford.  John McGinley in studio right now.  Eliza Schlesinger was in studio.  She's a very attractive female stand-up comedian.  Colin Quinn called in.  I don't even remember what started the phone call, but I remember we got on the topic of the road trip that he's promised to take with Bobo.  Bobo happened to be in the building to do some production for us, and he came running into the studio so that he, too, could be a part of this conversation. 
[00:41:30]  It's Eliza, Colin Quinn, and Bobo on the Opie and Anthony show.  Number five.  We got a big star checking out right now.  Who?  Colin Quinn.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  Colin.  What the hell?  What the hell's going on there?  I heard Bobo's in the waiting room.  He said he might as well call me.  Is Bobo here, too?  Where's Bobo?  So you guys could get together and work out the plan.  Jesus. 
[00:42:00]  How are you doing there, Colin?  Oh, shit.  That's good.  Just plow right in.  Why would you fucking wait?  Oh, my God, Bobo.  What happened?  So you have no idea what's going on.  That's Bobo.  Yes.  He's on the spectrum.  He's behind me.  He's a bit on the spectrum.  I feel like Jim, every time I tweet at Bobo, and I'm like, I think the fellas are into it.  I don't know if Jim Norton supports our trip.  Uh-oh.  He lets it, he doesn't even answer, because I think like there's, you know, some tension  from the last time Jim had done Bobo a few weeks ago.  Let's not forget.  No, there's no tension between him and I. 
[00:42:30]  It is just his incessant lack of ability to understand what's happening in a conversation  and his plowing into everybody.  It's verbal bumper cars every time.  Causing physical injury.  All the innocent strangers.  It's amazing that no matter what you have going on, it's just this fucking blathering  that's self-involved.  I hear that. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, I know.  I'm here.  I can hear that.  I know.  I saw you.  That's good.  Yeah.  This is how you learn.  Yeah.  Right?  Calling you.  Yeah, we all are very puzzled.  You guys just want to call it.  You guys are really ruining my reputation as business.  First, the Mark Cuban incident with all people.  All right.  We got past that.  And now to John C.  McKinley.  Right.  Those are two people I can never work with again.  Well, you should have just played your goddamn part with Crocodile Dundee and not tried to  be a big savior of the movie. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure it's fine when John C. McKinley shows up and says, hey, guys, I took the  trouble.  The script you've been writing and researching for three years, I took the trouble to do  a little research on my own.  You don't think they appreciate that?  No, it's basically implying like you guys didn't flesh out my character, so I did it for  you.  Hey, Colin, I was talking about the road trip, and I was giving a good idea to whenever somebody 
[00:44:00]  falls asleep on the road trip, whenever somebody passes out, we write on them.  I love that.  I love that.  Is this for real?  Is this for real?  Is this a real person?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi.  Yeah, but we write them, obviously, in a sharpie or something, so that it can come  right off.  You like that idea, Colin?  You like the idea?  Yeah, I love it, actually.  Those are great names.  What about, and Opie's already, Opie promised, Danny, Danny Boy, Opie promised to accompany us 
[00:44:30]  on a show.  Absolutely.  A trial trip, though.  I'm a...  Yes.  Fucking nightmare.  And if that goes well, I'll certainly join you guys.  A nightmare that'd be.  Borgasm.  It's a little financial...  Yeah, by the way, it's a little financial problem going on, because you've invited now,  I saw three names that you listed today.  Katie, Tim, your buddy Tim, and Lynn Bella. 
[00:45:00]  Now, you know, you're kind of...  Bobo, what are you, inviting girls?  Well, no, well, they asked to be a part of this, to help out with the trip.  Oh!  Well, it's going to cost money.  Yeah, man.  They're going to help out some...  Well, Katie lives in Westchester.  Oh!  I didn't know the trip took Westchester.  What does that have to do with anything?  You're not even going near Westchester.  Well, she doesn't have to fly to New York to get to the road trip.  But the bid is simple.  It's just you two in a car, enjoying each other's company. 
[00:45:30]  Cretans in cars getting coffee.  And then I'm there to maybe film it and throw in my two cents.  That's it.  It's him in a car with a girl?  With Colin Quinn.  With Colin Quinn going...  This is happening.  It's not going to end in vehicular manslaughter.  This is happening.  That's where we were going to use a minivan.  They're going to be filming this stuff.  You're talking to me?  You're talking to me?  Like I said, that's where we're going to use a minivan.  I know, we heard that.  Yeah, we heard that.  It's a radio.  We heard it.  It's time. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know about that writing on TV.  Hey, maybe we should pick up some trannies for Jim Norton while we're on the road.  Oh, that's a good one.  That's a good idea.  Wow, that was a cutting edge.  I accept that.  Yeah, bring back some trannies from the road for Jimmy.  Yeah, we heard you again.  Yeah, we got time.  It's always good to reiterate immediately after.  Right.  Not even a pause, just a semicolon, and then reiterate.  Semi-colon.  You like that, right? 
[00:46:30]  I like it.  Yeah, it's a semicolon.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  I like how that got grown, but the cat jokes were well-received.  Yeah, I was kind of playing it like they were horrible jokes.  Oh, I just supported mine 100%.  I went hard in the paint for that one.  Hard in the taint.  Thank you.  See, now that's funny.  Goodbye.  This was great.  Yeah.  Back to the turnpike.  Hey, the behind-the-scenes team does involve some females, Eliza.  Oh, no. 
[00:47:00]  You like Eliza?  She's great.  Yeah, she looks good, all right, Dave?  She what?  She's what?  She looks good.  You're more welcome to be part of the road trip team.  I don't want you to talk about it.  Dave, just play.  Welcome.  Goodbye.  What are you doing?  You just invited Eliza.  I'm officially out.  There's too many people involved.  Are you attracted to Eliza?  I'm out.  I don't want to hear me.  You don't want the answer?  Because if it's no, I'll feel even worse.  I'm out.  I'm saying we need people to film this stuff and do other things behind the scenes, set 
[00:47:30]  up the whole thing.  I aim to be behind the scenes.  Way behind the scenes, like back in New York.  Listening from afar.  He needs like PAs, you know?  Oh, you need some assistance around on the trip there, Bobo?  Yeah, of course.  People got to operate the camera, webcams, and make sure the online feed.  The webcams.  And the segments of the road trip that are going to be over the air.  I feel like surveillance cameras will take care of a lot of the activities. 
[00:48:00]  We're going to have to worry about it.  Participating in.  Maybe you can contact GoPro and see if they'll chip in some cameras.  Yeah, you ought to strap like...  Yeah, we'll strap a bunch of cameras on Bobo.  Yeah.  But we got like an Audi dealer, somebody who's going to sponsor the actual car.  Well, we think Audi wants to sponsor.  We got an Audi dealer that sponsors a car, then we slap their sponsor logo on the vehicle.  Wow, you know how to move and shake these business deals.  Well, that's part of the deal.  And any sponsors that me and Colin get a hold of... 
[00:48:30]  Get a Chrysler minivan and put an Audi sticker on the side of it.  There you go.  We want to have their sponsor's logo.  So, for example, let's say a gas company like Sunoco...  He's spitballing now.  He's just spitballing.  The art of the deal is going down.  I'm making a sample.  Let's say a company like Sunoco wants...  Sunoco.  Sunoco.  Sunoco.  Exactly.  What you breathe through when you're in a tub of gasoline.  Sunoco.  Well...  It's like a snorkel and...  I don't know what it is.  What's the help of funded... 
[00:49:00]  Oh, God, he just plows through.  It's fucking...  I've never heard anybody boulder their way through a fucking back-and-forth give-and-take.  This isn't Shark Tank.  You talk like you're fucking pleading for your life in Scarface.  I'll give you ten sponsorship stickers, Tony.  You want cameras on Elvira?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, bubs. 
[00:49:30]  I think we got a great idea here.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  As long as this logo stops inviting people.  She's in the car on a road trip.  Yeah.  That's it.  Cross-country.  Holland is the ultimate goal.  To do what?  LA.  Where are you going?  LA?  Yeah, and we do various stuff.  On the road.  Like what?  Maybe there's a...  Depending on the states we pass by on the roadway to New York to LA.  An example, let's say we pass to Indianapolis.  We take a tour to Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  Take rides in an actual race car. 
[00:50:00]  That's actually an actual race car?  Not a race car simulator.  Did you come up with that, man?  Yeah, I came up with that.  Then we get into the next car, and then we get into the next car.  Hey, he's taking this very seriously.  Okay.  He's coming up with ideas.  Yeah.  Yeah, like maybe they...  Because I know they do that, where you...  I guess...  Who's that?  You pay a certain amount of money.  Yeah.  You could drive...  Yeah, who's that?  You could drive a race car around the track.  Oh, I'm sure they'd hand...  Don't interrupt.  I'm sure they'd just hand you the keys of a fucking...  Yeah.  ...million dollar race car.  You're driving it right into the fucking wall.  Exactly.  If you ride a race car, it's going to be in front of a fucking supermarket. 
[00:50:30]  One of those ones that just...  Wait, you put the quarter in?  Where are you going to get the quarter?  What would you do if you ended up in a state that doesn't have a lot of cool stuff?  Like Nebraska.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you going to do in Nebraska?  Do you even know where Nebraska is?  Yes, I know.  It's somewhere in the Midwest.  All right, but what are you going to do in Nebraska?  Because you're going to have to think on your feet.  Maybe certain places, like maybe a place that's maybe more of a farming area, we visit an  actual farm. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, you mean the whole country?  Oh, you, Colin, farm.  This is amazing.  What would you do on the farm?  Yeah, what would you do?  Well, I guess maybe we did...  I guess maybe just for the heck of it, they'd have us do something, maybe do a little sample,  maybe demonstrate, maybe one of the guys will demonstrate one of the jobs on the farm  and me and Colin have to do that.  Like what would the job be?  Like what?  What do you think they'd do on farms?  And what kind of farms?  Yeah.  Well, who knows what...  Everyone knows.  Like extracting horse semen with your mouth?  No, I guess maybe...  I guess maybe they'd make us try to attempt to milk a cow. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah, because that's not done with machines now.  Yeah.  What are you, fucking in Walnut Grove with paw angles?  Are you Amish?  Yeah.  Speaking of paw angles, can you throw that thing back up on the table?  What if it wasn't a dairy farm?  Yeah, yeah.  What if it was like a fruit farm?  Yeah, yeah.  Like a vegetable farm.  Like a hidden valley. 
[00:52:00]  A vegetable farm.  You could just go in with the crops.  Just blend with the potatoes?  Yes.  I don't know exactly how they pick the vegetables off of the farm.  They do exactly that.  They pick it.  Yeah.  They use the machinery.  They go pick them themselves.  Oh.  I don't see this being a really riveting moment, though.  Big segment.  Colin and Bobo pick yams.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh?  We just got boxed into a corner.  Yeah.  See what's going on here?  This is like...  There's no bad ideas when you're brainstorming. 
[00:52:30]  Only terrible ones.  What about Detroit?  What if you go to Detroit, Bobo?  What would you do there?  Well, I guess Detroit, we could take a little tour through Detroit, look at some of the abandoned  buildings.  Like actually pass through some of the abandoned buildings.  Yeah.  With the car or when you get out of the car?  Well, we drive through them.  Drive through the buildings themselves?  Yeah.  Drive past them.  Maybe take a few pictures in one.  I wouldn't call this brainstorming as much as a light sun shower. 
[00:53:00]  We could actually take photos in the abandoned buildings and maybe film videos of me and  Colin exploring one of the abandoned buildings.  All right.  That is good.  It makes sense.  Video makes sense.  Exploring one of the abandoned buildings and maybe because Detroit could use some good  laughs, me and Colin do a little show.  Whoa.  Wow.  Let's go.  Okay.  Yeah, like Colin could headline maybe a show.  What's the grand finale?  You need a, like, you know.  Yeah, what's the last thing you're going to do? 
[00:53:30]  The grand finale is going to be a bit, well, I said.  The season finale.  What is it?  They kill a fat girl the way they did that cow in Apocalypse Now.  It's going to, it's going to, it's going to, I was thinking it's going to start.  What city would the grand finale be in?  Yeah, yeah.  L.A. I guess.  L.A. would end in L.A.  I think so.  I think you'd make it all the way.  Oh, boy.  Never happens.  Well, I said it would start with the launch, with the, with the start party.  Well, when we get, I mean, the road trip would begin here in New York with the start party. 
[00:54:00]  A start party.  A start party.  Are there going to be a middle, a middle congratulatory reception?  Well, once we get there, there'll be a big, uh.  It sounds like the cannonball run.  It would be a big complete.  It's like a start party, and they all drink Burt Reynolds and shit.  I gotta be honest, this sounds like a web series at best.  And I guess, I guess we do a whole huge, uh, O&A broadcast.  Oh, we do.  You have to be a part of it.  And we come in to save the day.  Yeah, I'm in a serious one.  We're in a studio.  Right.  And yourselves.  Yeah.  And then maybe, I guess maybe, uh, just for the heck of it, uh, Liza would be in a bikini 
[00:54:30]  when she'd be in a, in the car.  Oh, Liza.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm back.  See, she's all in now.  I love it.  I love it.  I don't like, I don't like the fact that a Miss Urbani has been, uh, somehow removed from  this scenario.  And that's very sexist, Pobo.  She's only good to be in a bikini.  Are you attracted?  I've had my back to you the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Are you attracted to Liza?  Shut up, Jim.  I'm just asking.  You can tell. 
[00:55:00]  No, I think she looks good.  Thanks.  How about Liza?  Thank you.  He'd throw you a bone.  Makeover for Lady Di.  Do what?  Oh.  You have to take Lady Di out and give her like a full makeover.  That's a, it's one half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  The two old women.  I want, I want no part of this cavalcated Miss Fortune.  Yeah, of course.  I'm going to parade through here.  We'll spare you that one.  The sideshow.  What's the finale, you fuckwad?  Yeah, come on.  You find a chromosome?  What's the finale?  It would be a massive, it would be a massive party with some guest stars.  No, but you've got to have a big thing that happens. 
[00:55:30]  A party's a party.  Yeah.  Like a big, holy shit.  Like the farm or the fucking Detroit.  Yeah, like you guys are going bungee jumping or something.  What are you doing in L.A.?  We'll go across the border to Mexico and see if we're going to run into a cartel.  Yeah, that's what it is.  You run through Juarez and fucking hundreds of tapes here off the body.  That's a finale now.  See?  See, brother, that's a finale, though.  What's your finale?  What do you do in L.A. besides the party?  The party's like the rap, really. 
[00:56:00]  Well, there'd be us visiting some sites in L.A.  And we'd also watch.  Like what sites?  You fuck.  We had plenty of time to think about this.  They want specifics.  And don't use the word maybe again.  Right.  Yeah.  We would take a tour of some of the sites.  Say sites again, and I'll throw you over that.  Sites or maybe.  Don't say it.  No!  No maybe.  Don't say maybe.  I'm sure there is some movies.  This is your bid. 
[00:56:30]  Own it.  What sites are you going to in L.A.?  There are some movie studios that have had some history that they do tours of.  Oh, so you're going to go to a movie studio.  Universal Studios.  That's the big finale.  That's the season finale?  Wow.  Why don't you go on the Back to the Future ride?  Oh, I can see Colin on the Jurassic Park ride with Bobo.  Yeah.  That would be terrific.  Yeah.  See, that's where I'm still at.  To see Colin.  This is great.  Loves a laugh.  And we would also make people think before we arrive, we would make people think something  happened to us on the way.  Something did happen to you.  I'm listening to you. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, on the way out of the birth canal, something happened to you.  Something happened.  It's called oxygen was cut off.  You know, you have to actually do this.  I would love to.  We're in.  We're going to do it.  This is going to be the lowest radio prank ever.  This is going to be the greatest thing ever.  This is going to be the end of radio.  This is going to be a little trial road trip around the area.  It's happening.  I'm telling you.  Bobo.  You guys could jump in my car.  I don't care.  Let's do this.  Bobo.  I've got to see this.  So you're going to make...  What do you mean make people think something happened?  Like we're going to send some of the people ahead of us, some of the people that were 
[00:57:30]  in the road trip ahead of us.  What do you mean?  It's good to announce it on the radio now.  We're going to pull a big prank.  Really well thought out.  I can't say how we're going to make this.  I'm writing a whodunit, and we're not going to tell people that the butler did it until  the very end.  But you just did.  You are a dumps.  You just gave away your fucking big ending.  Now you can't do it ever.  Now you've got to get a new one.  Why would you announce it on the radio?  We have to re-brainstorm all over again.  Oh, Bobo. 
[00:58:00]  I think this thing's falling apart, Bobo.  You blew it.  You've got to fucking own this shit.  We're going to...  Well, we're still going to send some people ahead of us.  Looks like we got ditched.  Where are you going to send them to?  What are you talking about?  A, what people ahead of you, and B, where will they go where people are waiting for you?  And who ditched you if you're the ones driving?  No one's going to know or be there or care.  There's not going to be any organization of people waiting for you.  No one's going to listen to this.  Oh, there's got to be a location. 
[00:58:30]  We've got to find a location first.  Oh, boy.  How about the La Brea Tar Pits, and then you drive your fucking van into it?  I'm not familiar with L.A.  I've never been to L.A.  So why would you pick L.A. to go to?  Because that would be a big finale of the road trip from east to east to west.  From east to east to west.  So you've got to go east to east first, and then you go west.  All right.  That's a little different.  You go to New York, Philly, and then.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Or maybe it's New York, China.  Maybe that's what it's meant.  It's global.  Maybe you could go to, like, Hollywood, and you could see if your feet fit in the footprints 
[00:59:00]  of the actors.  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  Yeah, look for the life goes on area.  Did Corky put his feet in the front?  He actually went face first, and no one told him.  It's just a conflection site.  It had nothing to do with the walk.  Oh, boy.  He's still there.  No one knows he's there yet. 
[00:59:30]  He's stuck.  I can do imagine.  He's got his little sign.  Just a big tongue print.  Is that the construction?  I'm going to be laughing.  That's terrible.  Is that the construction site?  I'm going to be laughing about that.  Sir, those are orange cones.  Please.  Fuck.  I can report all of that.  Go to the beach in a bathing suit.  What?  Oh, okay.  Now, Colin, you're going to.  Wait, wait, wait.  To be fair, which is more than most people in L.A.?  Most people just wear their clothes right in the water. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, that's true.  Bobo, if you don't mind.  If you don't mind, can I pump that up?  Go to the Baywatch beach.  See?  Do you think you'll see the show being filmed there, Bobo?  Yeah, we drove there in a DeLorean.  We won.  Oh!  Good one.  I set it up and you threw it back.  Fucking quick.  Showed it.  Wow.  You showed her, Bobo.  He's a fucking chef.  Let's continue to put my back to you. 
[01:00:30]  That's fantastic.  I should say more specifically, we drove there to a DeLorean with Liza in a bathing suit.  Oh.  Oh, God.  How creeped out are you?  I would leave a bathing suit alone at this point.  What's a bathing suit?  Oh, God.  Wouldn't you say a bikini?  A bathing suit.  A bathing suit.  Bikini.  I think I know what that means.  In a bikini.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't wear bikinis in Baywatch.  That's historically inaccurate DeLorean face.  Yeah.  He shows up in a two-piece.  Yeah.  What's lifeguard?  He's like, hold on while you're...  Yeah.  I think you should go to the beach in one of those 1920s striped bathing suits with a parasol. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Just walk around the beach being an idiot.  I think you should go to the beach with shorts made out of cement.  Go for a dip off the pier.  Do your Kittner boy impression.  Well, I was all in, but I think the idea is falling apart, Bobo.  You've got to focus, man.  Your idea is going by the wayside here.  To streamline your stupidity.  Right.  We're all in if you can figure it all out.  Make a chalk outline of your idea. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  You don't have no season finale.  You don't know what you're doing in fucking Nebraska.  You want to go east-east before you go west.  There's problems here.  There is going to be a big season finale.  We don't...  Season?  I'm trying to figure out how this is going to end.  We know how it's going to end.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what.  We start...  How about this?  We start with Obie's idea.  It's allowed to, like, you know, send him riches or, like...  That was my idea?  The conch.  The conch.  You've got to go to the conch. 
[01:02:00]  We'll go to the conch.  Wrong conch.  Okay.  Out on Long Island.  The conch.  Yeah.  And we'll just drive around the lake.  You know, we'll start with something easy.  Your road trip should end the way Thelma and Louisa said.  Yes.  Murder, suicide.  Yes.  Send him a riches.  That'd be great.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the Opie Anthony channel.

But why bother talking about that when John McGinley was on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:07:00]  He's been in a ton of Oliver Stone movies.  He's been in one of your favorite movies, guaranteed, whether it's Any Given Sunday or Platoon or I don't know.  The list is too long to mention.  He was in the show Scrubs.  He's got a new show on TBS.  And he was on the Opie and Anthony show.  This week, here's how it went down.  Is it hard to stay natural?  Because, like, you know, you're playing it so well when you act. 
[01:07:30]  Is it hard to stay natural when you have to take those breaks and allow this element that you're not supposed to acknowledge in?  Not really.  No?  No, because you get the style of the piece pretty quick.  And you get it.  The difference between doing something with Oliver or doing something that David Mamet play or doing Scrubs even is that you have to commit to those words with your heart and soul.  Those words are gospel.  Those are what we're shooting today.  The four-camera live format doing ground floor, you're going to get alts every waking second of every day. 
[01:08:00]  You're going to get rewrites, whole new drafts.  So whatever you spent last night, seven hours memorizing that two-page single-space rant you memorized, it's gone.  I don't know how you guys do that.  Like a writer right there handing people sheets.  Every waking second of every day.  I don't know how you do the rewrites.  And if you can stay nimble with the words, if you can shadowbox them between your ears, if you can say really facile, you win.  If it's just water up the ducks behind, you win. 
[01:08:30]  If you're entrenched in Mamet's words, which you damn well should be, you lose.  Wow, yeah.  In this format.  Uh-huh.  You've got to be just, you've got a shadowbox.  I don't know how you do it.  What do you mean shadowbox?  Do you mean like occasionally you'll deliver a line slightly differently than they wrote it, but it's kind of the same?  No, you'll get a whole new rewrite for the entire scene that we were playing in the studio today.  And even once we nail the studio scene once, we're going to get a second draft that the writers have, 
[01:09:00]  and we're going to come in and reshoot this in front of the audience, and with every single syllable, it's different.  That's pressure.  Oh, man.  That's pressure.  That's what I mean.  You've got to be able to stay on your toes.  But do you ever feel that pressure going, oh, my God.  Well, I'm so competitive, yes.  Yeah.  I want to crush it every time.  And so, yeah, it gets me going.  You get to a live audience, and now you've got a script that you're totally not familiar with because it's coming in at last minute.  And I'm Mr. Homework.  That's stress.  There were some adjustments in the first three or four episodes. 
[01:09:30]  I had to make some.  Okay.  Yeah.  So you're at home reading the script, learning it.  I'm devouring it at home.  And then they're giving you something different.  They say, fuck that.  Forget what you memorized.  What about this, huh?  Well, the stuff you memorized last night, we're not shooting.  Amazing.  Oh, my God.  When you memorize the script, will you go over it by yourself, or do you have somebody with you?  And do you try to say it out loud, or do you just try to kind of get it in your head and not say it out loud?  First thing I do with everything from Go is I write it out in my own hand because at least cerebrally that it becomes yours since you've written it out. 
[01:10:00]  Then the words are yours.  And then I put verbs in the margin about what we're doing with the words.  And then I start saying them out loud.  And once I know them, I start juggling because nothing, no preoccupation on the set will be more intrusive than juggling.  Oh, you physically actually juggle.  Literally juggling.  Yeah.  And whenever you, because once your juggling skills get to perfectly adequate, you won't drop a ball unless something's wrong.  And then when you drop something on that one word over and over again, there's a problem. 
[01:10:30]  Either you have a problem, or there's a problem with the word, or the rhythm of the line is off.  And then you should be able to get on the set, and whether it's scrubs or ground floor and somebody sneezes in the audience or a gurney goes by and scrubs, it's not going to throw you off.  Because you already, last night you were doing this.  It's no big deal.  I must say, I've never heard that technique before.  No, that's great.  It's like an x-ray machine to the text.  When you start dropping a ball, you'll do it consistently at that one spot at the end of the paragraph, something's wrong.  You're either running out of air, you're thinking of your grandmother. 
[01:11:00]  I don't know what the thing is, but something, there's a problem.  Because you shouldn't be dropping the ball.  Wow.  Now on a movie, I do the same thing with every script I've ever got.  You do the same thing.  But as far as being on a set in a movie, it's got to be different than having to learn something in a week or a few days and then getting in front of a live audience.  It's totally different.  Yeah, that's like two different types of jobs.  I had Glenn Gary out there in Los Angeles for two months before I came to New York.  We had the offer for the play. 
[01:11:30]  So I set up a theater boot camp.  I keep a rehearsal space out there.  And I just set up a theater boot camp where I hired a young guy who came and we ran the lines two hours in the morning, two hours in the afternoon for almost seven weeks.  I came to rehearsal so loaded for bear.  And that is antithetical to what we're doing with Ground Floor.  There's no theater boot camp.  There's, you know, bring it.  Shout a box.  Be light.  Be agile.  Being that you obviously take your work very seriously and learn the script. 
[01:12:00]  I don't want to sound like too seriously.  No, no, not serious.  I don't mean serious, but it's like you're working.  That's good quality.  Would you work with people that you're like, you didn't even read this, did you?  Well, I did this really diabolical with people who don't know their lines.  It's a horrible, horrible thing.  And it's very quiet.  And I always, when actors bring your lines on a script and they're called sides, that particular.  So when people still bring their sides onto the floor when we're about to shoot, I can't take it. 
[01:12:30]  And so sooner or later, I'll just whisper in their ear, listen, you can just keep those pictures up in the frame.  You can keep those words up in the frame the whole time we're shooting because you know what?  What?  They're just going to be on me listening.  The coverage is good.  My listening is much more interesting than you struggling with the goddamn words.  Are you fucking kidding me? 
[01:13:00]  Really?  That would be a little intimidating.  I was talking to my fucking kids last night, and I know my fucking lines.  Exactly.  What the fuck were you doing?  You don't put up with shit.  I hate it.  I hate it.  Yeah, yeah.  What are we doing?  What are we doing here?  What are you talking about, you know, in your lines?  Wow.  How fucking dare you?  Can I ask a question?  What you just said?  I have two questions for you.  One is how do you still listen when you know the words so well?  Like, how do you still make it?  Like, it's like a moment like we're having right now.  You've never heard me say this.  And how does a great actor do that?  You put the verbs in the margin.  What are you doing? 
[01:13:30]  What are you doing when you're listening?  What are you actively doing?  What verb are you doing?  As I'm listening to you, am I assimilating?  Am I flourishing?  Am I preoccupied with, in the context of the movie, the bomb that's out in the lobby?  How am I listening to you?  And so the verbs in the margin influence everything.  So you'll know if you're going to make a smirk at a certain word or...  Sure.  Smirk is a verb.  Yeah, yeah.  Smirk.  That's a good verb.  Yeah.  But you'll know all that stuff.  And maybe it's not even a visual smirk.  Maybe there's a smirk in the back of your head that just... 
[01:14:00]  And that lens is an x-ray machine.  It comes through.  It sees that smirk you put in the back of your brain.  Because sometimes I've seen those subtleties on film and it's like, how...  Did they just do that?  Or did they know they were going to do that?  Because it looks so natural.  A lot of people are more natural and gifted than I am.  And so I like to avoid this scenario.  That when you're wrapped and you're driving home, you do this.  Oh, I wish I had.  Yeah.  And you can't.  We're not going back.  We're not shooting it again.  We're shooting this right now.  That's it. 
[01:14:30]  Then we're moving on to the restaurant scene.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't want to have those regrets.  It drives me out of my mind.  Because that machine is going the whole time.  And I don't want to have regrets.  We've got to ask you about Oliver Stone.  We've had him on.  He's an interesting dude.  He's very interesting.  What's your take on him?  Oliver, the actors are best served with Oliver when I can always think of the Kentucky Derby  thoroughbreds when I think of Oliver.  And I'll tell you why.  Because you know how they have those blinders on? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Well, when you're on a set with Oliver, those blinders are tantamount to his creative vision.  And so if you can fit within that vision where those blinders are, it is fucking nirvana.  If you want to go outside, you'll get crushed.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean he'll allow you to know it in front of everybody or he'll boot you off?  He knows exactly what he wants is what you're saying.  It's his film.  Right.  We're not collaborating.  Right.  This is Oliver's vision.  Come inside here and roam around in here. 
[01:15:30]  As long as Oliver can see you, you'll be all right.  Yes.  It's Oliver's film.  It's not...  And he makes that very clear.  And you should be so lucky.  Yeah, no shit, right?  You should be so lucky to play on that field.  And so that's the number one takeaway from work.  I've done six with Oliver.  Six Oliver Stone movies.  I mean, Platoon, obviously, Wall Street.  Any given Sunday.  What else?  Platoon, Wall Street, talk radio.  Oh, talk radio.  I did talk radio down at the public for almost two years before we did the movie. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And the conventional wisdom is that if you did the play, you're damn sure not doing the movie  because we're going to star fuck somebody and get a big name in there.  Yeah.  And so that I got to do the movie was largely fantastic.  No shit, yeah.  And so then talk radio, then Born in the Fourth, then Nixon, then any given Sunday.  Oh, my God.  Born in the Fourth, right.  Born in the Fourth.  Damn.  Forgot.  He must like you.  I mean, I think everybody's looking to make their life easier.  I think we all, the part of the human condition is wanting to be able to connect dots in a 
[01:16:30]  straight line and not some circuitous twice as hard.  And so if you find some Irish check in Jersey, you might go to a right-hander out of the pen.  You got any Oliver Stone stories?  Let's see.  Anything that pops out here today?  Oliver came up to, when I couldn't do Born in the Fourth of July because I was doing Fat  Man and Little Boy in Mexico with Paul Newman about the making of the Tom Pops.  Oh, right, yeah, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  John Cusack was in there.  Yeah, Johnny was in there.  And so I'm down in Durango, Mexico, and Oliver had intimated months earlier that he wanted  me to play that great male nurse who cleans Tom the first time he comes home as an amputee.  This beautiful scene.  And I was waiting for the phone to ring, and it never rang.  And so Paramount called and offered me this great, like, seventh lead in Fat Man and Little  Boy with Johnny and Paul.  And so I took it.  And so I'm down in Durango, Mexico, which is 8,000 feet up in the Sierra Madres.  It was the top of the cocaine triangle. 
[01:17:30]  It's in Star Wars, they go to Los Isles Spaceport, and we hear Alec Guinness say it's the epicenter  of vim and villainy in the universe.  That's what Durango is.  It's the epicenter of vim and villainy.  But it's so high up, John Wayne shot all these great Westerns there.  So we're down there because it looked a little bit like Los Alamos in 1945.  That's the backdrop.  We're working hard.  We're doing our thing.  The phone rings.  I pick it up. 
[01:18:00]  It's like 7 in the morning, Los Alamos time, Durango time.  And it's Oliver.  And he goes, McKinley, are you fucking there?  I said, Oliver?  Oliver?  He said, yeah.  Why the fuck aren't you in Dallas with me?  And I said, because you didn't offer me the goddamn film.  And he goes, I fucking made you.  You fucked me.  You're fucking me.  Click.  Wow.  And I don't remember if I cried or if I just probably tried. 
[01:18:30]  It's over.  It's over.  And he was right.  He did make me.  And so I then paid penance for two films.  I would do the reshoots of Wheeling Tom out in Born the Fourth of July as an extra.  And then I played a tiny little role in Nixon.  And I was still paying penance.  And then he finally took me back into the fold on any given Sunday.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  You had a bigger role that he wanted you for in?  Yes. 
[01:19:00]  It would eventually be an African-American actor.  He would recast it.  And it's a glorious scene when Tom realizes that his legs are gone.  And the first guy to wash him, it's an unbelievably tragic scene.  And that was the one I was going to do.  And they were shooting in Dallas when we were in Durango.  There's nothing I could do.  What are you going to do?  But did he get mad when you explained, look, I didn't think you wanted me because you didn't call him?  There was no explanation.  It was click.  But you were to assume that he was just going to have you eventually.  Yes.  That's what I mean.  You should have just waited around.  That's what I mean. 
[01:19:30]  You have to fit in this vision.  So you should have known what he was thinking.  You should have been a mind reader.  How were you not reading my mind?  Wow.  Because you weren't even offered it.  I was not.  Wow.  And it would have been presumptuous to think I was.  Of course.  Oh, man.  I have a question, too, about it.  Because you're saying guys that don't memorize their lines, a lot of them.  And I was thinking about this a couple days ago about a guy like Brando, who had such a weird way of doing things.  But there's an anomaly.  He's an anomaly.  But do you think that for him it was how he worked?  Or do you think he got lazy?  I mean, not to knock his – he was, I think, the greatest, but what is it? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  And I don't care.  Because when I'm watching him, I can suspend my disbelief.  Unless he's doing one of those – he always thought he had a great ear for accents.  And he doesn't.  You know, he plays that Asian guy one time.  He gets his – and he plays the Irish guy in the Missouri Breaks.  And you're like, just talk.  Just talk.  You're distracting everybody with that.  All of a sudden, you sound like a fucking leprechaun.  You're like, your brain, though.  Just talk.  Like, just put that thing in the back of your throat and just whisper. 
[01:20:30]  Did you like him as a German in The Young Lions?  I did buy him as a German in The Young Lions.  But that was his, what, second or third film.  And he's so gorgeous.  And you're like, oh, my God.  It looks like Mount Rushmore with the thing.  And I love that.  Yeah, he could play a good German.  That's for sure.  Obviously, making Platoon, you're out there.  Where was that filmed?  The Philippines.  We were in the Philippines.  Marcos wouldn't leave.  There was an election, Ferdinand Marcos lost, and he lost to a woman named Corey Aquino.  And then he wouldn't leave. 
[01:21:00]  He decided he wanted to be a dictator instead of a president.  And then he, you know, nobody knew about it until Reagan gave him political asylum in Hawaii.  And then Imelda's Shoes became the...  That was the story.  ...serial of late-night comedy.  And so we landed in revolution-torn...  They had a revolution to get him out.  And we landed, Willem Dafoe and I, and everybody landed a couple of weeks after the revolution.  So 13-year-olds were walking around Manila with AKs.  Wow.  And action.  And action. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  Did you feel like you were in danger at that point?  You were.  You were in imminent danger.  Because Aquino didn't completely have the army.  And every single minute of every single day, there was a threatened coup.  And that's very unsettling.  There was always a story during the 80s about Vietnam movies and how hard they were to make.  You had to go somewhere that had to look like Vietnam.  And they all tanked.  And they all tanked.  I mean, The Green Berets was... 
[01:22:00]  I don't know what film The Green Berets was, but it was John Wayne's version.  Oh, that was trying to...  Of a really good...  They were trying to World War II Vietnam.  That didn't...  Yeah.  Platoon was one of the first movies that really came out and was like, okay, wow, this is brutal.  There was Apocalypse before...  Yeah, but Apocalypse is arguably not even about Vietnam.  Right, right.  It's about Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and a journey...  Yes.  Our protagonist's journey up a river.  And it was a very caricatured version of Vietnam.  You felt with Platoon that there was more realism there.  There was no statement about the war. 
[01:22:30]  I'll serve two tours as an infantryman.  Yeah, yeah.  He was teaching English at the American school in Vietnam.  And I guess that impacted him in a way that he was...  He didn't feel like he was contributing.  So he joined the army and he was in the infantry for two tours.  Toof, man.  And he was kind of passing that along to people?  I think he ripped Platoon out of his sternum.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think he went like this.  Here, here's my truth.  And was he actually a combination of Barnes and Elias? 
[01:23:00]  No, no, no.  No?  No.  Or was he the kid?  He's Charlie.  Yeah, he's Charlie.  Yeah, he was writing letters to his grandma.  I don't know if she's still alive.  She was a French.  No.  I met her plenty of times in the Upper East Side.  And no, he was Charlie.  I actually meant that Charlie was influenced by both of them in the movie.  Yeah.  And if he...  Did he have two guys that he was influenced by like that?  Yeah.  Like one good and one bad?  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, and there was a real Sergeant O'Neill. 
[01:23:30]  And his name wasn't Sergeant O'Neill, but there was a real guy who Oliver made that guy up after.  And so...  Yeah.  That's his truth.  It was an amazing collection of characters in that movie.  And cast.  And cast, please.  It's amazing.  Forrest.  Yeah, yeah.  Whitaker.  Tom.  Willem.  Charlie.  Yeah, yeah.  Tony Todd.  Francesco Quinn.  Rest in peace.  Yes, yes.  Corey Glover was very good.  Corey was great in it.  Yeah, yeah.  We, obviously, we fucking laugh our asses off at certain parts of that movie. 
[01:24:00]  And one of the greatest parts is the poker game.  Because it's really the first time you see Barnes laugh.  Yeah.  And it almost looks like it's paining him to laugh.  You're right.  And it's, you know, when he's setting it up to be Jewish.  And he's like...  It's a great scene.  Just fucking funny as hell.  I'm glad you see, because nobody ever says that they laugh during Platoon.  And I'm like...  Oh!  But there's funny stuff in this.  There are so many funny.  Insanity.  Right, right. 
[01:24:30]  Oliver was smart enough to sprinkle a laugh or two.  It's hard to even say that there's a laugh in Platoon.  But there freaking well are.  Yeah, yeah.  The fact that Barnes couldn't believe you...  Like, all Barnes had seen, and your Jewish joke, he's like, oh, fuck, he went there.  It was just great.  That's over the edge.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  I think O'Neill's...  I think that when I would write these characters...  things about the characters, and I told Oliver that you need to go into Oliver and tell  him your version.  And I decided that he was a remp, which is a rear echelon motherfucker, and that he was 
[01:25:00]  probably in Doolzador for some place, just dealing poker hands with officers.  And I think he was probably a liar and a cheater.  And he cheated the wrong officer, and bang, he was sent to Southeast Asia.  Oh, man.  And he's in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He's not equipped to be here.  And so he just becomes a pilot fish for Barringer's character.  He just becomes a parasite.  Here's how I'm going to get out of here.  I'm going to suck off his kills.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here.  So that he... 
[01:25:30]  That great shot that Oliver put at the end, when he gets reassigned in the platoon, like  Captain Dye at the end.  That look is fantastic.  It's just the ultimate...  He's dead.  I always figured he would be dead in the next movement.  The next movement they did, he's dead.  Yeah, yeah.  And he knows it.  You write a backstory then?  Yeah, I always do.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, for Ground Floor, I turned it down a couple of times, because I had just done 42, the  Jackie Robinson story, and Glengarry.  And so I was, in a lovely, really organic way, transitioning towards this whole post-scrubs 
[01:26:00]  kind of career.  And it all felt good to me, and it felt like we were moving in the right direction.  And then all of a sudden, Billy Lawrence, the guy who invented scrubs and invented Ground  Floor, calls up and says, I got a good one for you.  It's live, and it's going to be good.  And I'm like, Billy, I got a good thing going on.  I'm going to keep following whatever this new path is.  And he seduced me.  And one of the ways he seduced me was, he said, you can make whatever you want out of this  guy. 
[01:26:30]  Here's all the creative slack in the leash that you want.  And so I took him at his word, and so I, over the summer, wrote something called the  Mansfield Manifesto.  The character's name is Mansfield.  And so I wrote a 20-page document about what this guy does, who he is, what his wardrobe  is, where he came from, kind of everything.  And I gave it to the writers.  And that could have been an act of pure jackass arrogance.  Oh, yeah.  Or a gift.  And Billy had these guys wired so that they could assimilate my input into what they were 
[01:27:00]  doing.  And it was a gift.  I made your life so much easier.  You, the writing staff.  And there's 14 kids from Harvard who all were editors of the Lampoon, and they're, you know,  Joe, brilliant, and Susie, brilliant.  And I just made your life easier with the Mansfield Manifesto.  Yeah, yeah.  And so it was the most I'd ever, it was the most I'd ever written on somebody.  But I wanted it that way.  If I was going to come back and do this and, God willing, grind for another five or six  years, I wanted to kind of do it on what I perceived as my terms. 
[01:27:30]  What an interesting way to do things, too, because it helps everyone out.  I mean, you know exactly where the character's coming from, because you pretty much wrote  the backstory for them.  And they now have so many leads to go on for various storylines or jokes or just dialogue.  It's got to, but there's that ego thing that has to be overcome from that, because they  could look and go, it's this fucking guy.  Right.  But because of the conversation I had with Bill Lawrence and the way we set the creative 
[01:28:00]  table ahead of time, he made it clear that he'd give me license to exercise these demons.  Well, you want to hear a great little story about somebody that didn't get license?  Colin Quinn.  What happened to Colin?  Well, Colin Quinn was on, um, what, what?  Crocodile Dundee 2.  And he had a little, little part in there, a cute little part that gave him.  A couple lines.  He decided he was going to go back after a day and write the script.  Rewrite.  Rewrite the entire script for Crocodile Dundee 2. 
[01:28:30]  And handed it in.  And hand it to the director.  And he made it, he made himself the guy who shows Dundee around New York.  It's a true asshole.  What a dumb fuck.  Did he can't?  No, but.  He should have.  It's such a crazy story.  I don't even know if I believe it to this guy.  Oh, I do.  You believe it, right?  Oh, that's Colin.  Page one, rewrite?  Yes.  Yeah.  And he handed it in, because he thought that he should be the guy showing Crocodile Dundee  around New York.  Yeah, that's a slippery slope.  Oh, man.  If you change words, there has to be, because my friends have done it in the past and gotten 
[01:29:00]  in a lot of trouble, gotten fired.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  If you change words, you better know who and where you are.  And I did.  With Ground Floor, I did know who and where I was.  Well, you got the heads up, too, that you were able to do that.  I got permission from the principal.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you do if you come up with a backstory, like, say, the one you said for O'Neill?  What do you do if you come up with this, and it kind of guides the way you're going  to play him?  And then on the first day of shooting, the director's like, whoa, whoa, no, no.  That's not how I saw this guy at all. 
[01:29:30]  How do you go back and fix that?  Well, you compared notes before the first day of shooting.  Oh, you talk it over first.  Hopefully, yeah.  Do you write this stuff before you audition for something, when you had to audition?  No, I used to, and it's a mistake, because when you go into the audition, you're going  to get thrown a curveball.  And I was Oliver's reader.  When you came into audition for Oliver, you read with me after Platoon for about four or  five films.  And because I love actors, it's the best thing that ever happened to you, because I'm going  to be with you.  I'm not going to be cold boy, you know, usually going in some cold shrew who doesn't give 
[01:30:00]  a shit about you.  And I'm with you.  I'm dying.  I love actors, and I'm with you.  And so I learned.  I got really good, because of being on this side of the table, at auditioning.  And you can get good at it.  Oh, shit.  That's a great way to get good at it.  Whether you're right for the role or not is something else.  But you can get good at that three-minute blah, blah.  Exchange, right.  Yes.  And if we're looking for a black guy, but we thought if we go a different direction,  it might be you, but we are going to go black, then you're not going to get it. 
[01:30:30]  And that's fine.  I get it.  But in Seven, I went in to meet David Fincher, and that was supposed to be, the head of the  SWAT was supposed to be a Latin American.  And I changed his mind.  I've heard you can do that, too.  They always say, like, well, they think they know what they're looking for, but they kind  of want to see you for something.  Yes.  I developed a theory when I was Oliver's reader that actors come in primarily with two different  comportments of two different kinds. 
[01:31:00]  One is Elvis Dust, and Elvis Dust is when they come in and, in Seven, even though we wrote  it for a Latin man, whatever you have on you, we want to rub up against that.  Whatever it is.  And it can't be arrogance, because there's nothing more repulsive.  It has to be a combination of the actor being in the right place, his or her self-esteem  level that day.  I don't know what it is.  It's the magic stuff.  And even if we can't put you in this movie, we're damn sure putting you in the next one. 
[01:31:30]  That's Elvis Dust.  And that's a one percenter.  99% of the time, because we're all filled with so much self-loathing and fear, and we're  afraid of our own shadow, we come in with Pigpen.  And Pigpen is, from Snoopy, is that kid with the black dust all around him.  And it proceeds and follows him everywhere.  You see it before you hear a word.  And so before that actor comes in the door, and the first thing she's going to say when  she comes in is, she was on a train to Philadelphia last night, because she had to go to her great  grandmother's wake, and she didn't have a chance to read the script. 
[01:32:00]  And you lost Oliver at Philadelphia.  Oh shit, it's just an excuse.  Now it's just another excuse, so I don't even care.  And I'm looking at the actor, and I'm like, oh, no, don't.  What are you doing?  Go in a different direction.  Slow motion.  Oliver just went like this.  Oh, God.  And so we come in, either Pigpen or Elvis does.  The worst is yet to come.

[01:37:00]  Yes, yes, it is the worst of the week countdown.  I am Sam Roberts, and these are the most wonderful things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  Still to come, Mike Tyson in studio.  Right now, I want to start everything that happened with Mayor Rob Ford.  The mayor of Toronto, who admitted to smoking crack recently.  He was in a city council session earlier this week.  His brother was there with him.  He was talking about the fact that he has purchased drugs within the last two years. 
[01:37:30]  He was talking about crack houses.  It's just a comedy of errors going on over there.  It's a political circus happening in Toronto right now.  This actually made ONA Clip of the Day.  If you haven't heard ONA Clip of the Day, that's going on every day at SiriusXM.com slash blog.  We're posting a clip from Opie and Anthony.  But right now, we listen to the guys break down everything that happened in that Toronto city council meeting with Rob Ford. 
[01:38:00]  Rob Ford gets asked if he has purchased drugs in the last two years.  Have you purchased illegal drugs in the last two years?  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  Waiting that long to answer.  Yes, I have.  Right to the point.  Yes, I have. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  He's the best.  The dramatic pause.  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.  He's like, should I answer this?  Right.  Because that's another question that should just be answered.  No.  No, I haven't.  The headline today, because this is more of yesterday's stuff.  Every day, this stuff, obviously.  Ex-staffers alleged drug use erratic behavior.  So basically saying, look, the guy has been doing a lot of this shit, not the one and done like he's trying to tell everybody.  But how could he?  What was that pause?  That was not an expected question.  That's Rob Ford. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's his personality, man.  He loves the dramatic moment.  So you're saying that that was something he wasn't thinking.  He was like, what I'll do is I'll pause.  Fuck yeah.  He wanted to make it as dramatic as possible.  I don't know.  This guy's very calculated.  That's also one of those moments where you're like, if I admit this, it never comes back.  Right.  Right.  I'm saying yes to purchasing drugs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because if I say no, knowing that I did purchase drugs in the past two years, they'll get me on it.  You'd think those thoughts would have already occurred to him because that's what the whole hearing's about. 
[01:39:30]  You're there doing it.  You have the apology, but do you have the question?  Because the question from the guy is hilarious because he's so polite about it.  I don't think the question's on there.  Oh.  I want them answered immediately.  Yeah, try to find it really fast.  Because the apology's great, but the question is terrific, too.  It just shows how polite they are up there in their political system.  Yeah.  Ford gets asked about a crack house he went to.  And at that residence, it has been...  This is all on the floor, by the way.  They're back to trying to, like, you know, govern up there in Toronto. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, a business.  And at that residence, it has been deemed or suggested it is a crack house, a house of...  Bill repute.  ...where drugs and other activities take place.  Did you, at any point in time, report that particular address to Municipal Licensing and Standard or the...  Let me just finish my question.  Or the police?  And is it your position or contention that should citizens be aware of addresses of those kinds in their community, 
[01:40:30]  that they should not report those addresses?  No, sir.  That is not a crack house.  What should...  Sorry?  That is not a crack house.  House.  And what is it?  It is a house with a family, with a father and a mother, and three sons and a daughter.  And how many bedrooms are in that house?  And crack, yes.  There are probably four or five members that live in the house.  The father just passed away.  It is not a crack house.  Have you visited the house?  Have you walked in the house?  No, you haven't.  So, you're listening to what the media says? 
[01:41:00]  Mayor Ford, please...  No, no, no.  Can I answer the question?  But allow Councillor Thompson to ask the questions.  I get to ask the questions.  Thank you.  You get to answer, Mayor.  I'm answering, but you don't want to hear my answer.  Actually, you're not being truthful.  That's my problem.  I'm not being truthful.  Have you been into that house?  I have no interest in being in that house.  I'm not a crack user.  Oh, shit.  Home run councilman.  No one else watched this yesterday?  It was amazing.  I missed this one.  Holy fuck.  Amazing.  He's trying to fight his way out of the fact that he smoked crack and everyone should just 
[01:41:30]  move on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's saying, hey, come on now.  Move on.  He's really being cocky for a guy who's admitting crack smoking.  Oh, man.  It was unbelievable.  That guy was never to the house.  Right.  Do you have the long form?  Did you find it?  Or...  If not, it's all right, I guess.  Most really inning experience that I have ever went through in my entire life.  The only other day that was worse than probably a couple days last year was when my dad died. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  He brings that up.  Dad died.  Outside of that, it was definitely the worst week of my life.  Oh, yeah.  Mayor Ford, I don't want to believe you.  Is he having the worst week ever?  We understand this is painful for you.  See how polite they are?  Congressman Captain Kangaroo.  From this experience, a greater understanding of other people's problems and perhaps a greater  compassion for people who have problems.  Counselor, I'm the first to help people out to have problems. 
[01:42:30]  What are you talking about?  I'm the first one there and the last one to leave when there is someone...  At a party.  At a crack party.  He's rattle off hundreds of people that I've sat and talked to and comforted and brought  them to my house and helped these people out of all ages.  The guy just goes, thank you.  Right, right.  Look how quiet it is in there.  He's probably a political friend of his.  Counselor Fletcher.  Yes, two very quick questions, Mr. Mayor. 
[01:43:00]  In August, you went to the Taste of the Danforth, and residents have told me you parked your  car in front of their home on Greenwood Avenue, and when you got out of your car, they invited  you in because they were quite concerned.  They felt that you were inebriated.  You called your staff to come and assist.  Did you drive there after drinking?  No, I was not drinking and driving, Counselor.  Were there any drugs involved?  Just parking on people's lawns.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's it.  It's like, yeah, I'm just going to give you some shit. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, sit down.  Can you imagine if this was, like, here, and a room full of people was allowed to ask  a politician about a smile on the back?  Any question?  Oh, it would be just brutal.  That's a shot of order.  Right.  Keep this going.  You know, we didn't really go through this.  I love this.  Counselor DeBearmaker.  Thank you.  Through you, Madam Speaker.  Mr. Mayor, in your tenure as mayor, have you ever assaulted any of your staff?  I can't stress enough how nice they are when they ask these questions. 
[01:44:00]  The best part.  Yes.  Right.  That should be a very quick no.  You should never go, like, wait, have I ever assaulted my staff?  No, he loves the spotlight, though.  Why say just no when you can give a long answer with everyone just looking at you?  In my entire tenure, I assaulted my staff.  He's thinking, have I ever done it in front of a camera when they might be able to approve it?  Of course.  That's what every question is now, is him thinking, was there a camera there? 
[01:44:30]  Because that fucking camera shit fucks me.  Of course.  Hit that.  I haven't assaulted any of my staff.  Oh.  No, I don't assaulted.  No, I don't assault any of them.  I've been here 13 years, and I've never assaulted any of my staff.  There was a, and I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Mayor, there was an important newspaper that on your, on St. Patrick's Day, while in this building, you actually shoved one of your own staff to the ground, and your other staff had to intervene and hold you back. 
[01:45:00]  You're saying that that, that, that, you know what, then you might talk to the person, if you believe everything you read, Councillor.  Uh-oh.  Well, I believe everything I read about you.  That might be a problem, but I think you should talk to whoever's, these allegations are made about, I think you should talk to that individual.  About what?  Because I, I think you're referring to the St. Patrick's Day party I had in my office.  That was very, a lot of that stuff in there, the media was completely wrong, and, um.  He's having St. Patrick's Day parties in his office. 
[01:45:30]  That wasn't very accurate how they reported it.  Some of it was true, and some of it was false.  He's the best!  And he's arrogant.  Oh, yeah.  He's really arrogant.  Oh, yeah, he is.  He ain't stepping down.  Like, he's mad that they're asking him, like, uh, you shouldn't believe everything you read.  There's video of him cracked up.  Right.  On crack, and, like, he's mad that they believe that he shoved someone at a party in St. Patty's Day.  And he's just throwing St. Patty's Day parties in his office?  How great is that?  This guy is the absolute greatest.  Uh, what else you got? 
[01:46:00]  Fuck it, let's just go long for him, so the clips we, we cut up.  Uh, let's see.  I love it.  Do you have the, uh.  Here's the brother.  I don't know if you want to play it before the apology.  Do you have the long-form apology on there?  Not yet, no.  Really?  Not on this.  Ah, man, because, all right.  So then he apologizes.  I forgot the exact question.  Something about Air Canada.  I guess he had an issue in Air Canada where he was wasted and drunk or something.  Oh.  Well, I think.  I don't have the actual question.  There's more stories of him being fucked up in various places. 
[01:46:30]  So then here's his apology for that one.  Okay.  I sincerely apologize.  I understand the embarrassment I caused every member of this council.  I understand the embarrassment that I've caused every resident in the city.  I'm humiliated by it, but I cannot change the past, Counselor Thompson.  All I can do is move on, and that's what I'm doing.  Oh, man.  There's another clip we've got to find. 
[01:47:00]  He's like, I'm just going to move on.  But isn't that a nice, honest, like, I like that apology.  I'm humiliated by it.  I've embarrassed everyone.  He's speaking at least in human terms.  Right.  I like that he's got an air of, you guys are all being unreasonable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  What other clips are up on this site?  Because there's one more that's really good.  This one just has the Doug Ford going off.  Yeah, that's his brother, who I had no idea was part of the system up there as well.  Rob Ford's brother.  Yeah.  He found a unique way to try to defend his brother. 
[01:47:30]  Uh-huh.  And that's it?  That's it on that site?  On this site, yeah.  We did all of them?  Fuck, there's one more that's really good.  About Air Canada.  I'll try to find that.  What did he do on Air Canada?  Was he, like, wasted yelling at the staff or something?  I don't know what the incident was, but he apologized for that, too.  And then everyone laughed at the end.  He's an apologizing motherfucker.  Yeah, because they're bringing up all sorts of shit they finally had.  Yeah.  We've had it with this guy and his shenanigans. 
[01:48:00]  Here's his brother, though, in the meantime.  Have you ever smoked marijuana?  Have you ever smoked marijuana?  Everyone?  What?  Yeah, why?  Right.  This is his dramatic moment to help his brother, Rob, out.  Yeah.  He's asking the counselor in general?  Everybody.  Yeah.  He's just everybody.  He wants people to come forward that have ever smoked marijuana.  Have you ever smoked marijuana?  Have you ever smoked marijuana?  Hold it. 
[01:48:30]  Have you ever smoked marijuana?  It's a question.  It's simple.  A yes or a no.  Have you smoked marijuana?  Point of privilege, Mom.  Okay.  Point of privilege.  Can I invoke point of privilege here?  Point of privilege.  I don't even know what that is, but I want to use that.  That sounds good.  Point of privilege.  What?  You were born with it. 
[01:49:00]  Ah, yes.  You know, the white type.  So that's a...  Wow.  He's the greatest guy.  Trying to defend him.  Oh, man.  That's a rough go.  Oh, yeah.  That's a rough go.  Yeah.  When your brother's up there yelling at the council, have you smoked marijuana?  Marijuana.  He's trying, though.  Have you smoked marijuana?  Thanksgiving dinner's going to be, I was up there trying to help you.  I was asking people.  Well, you didn't help me.  I don't ask the goddamn council if they smoke marijuana.  Everyone in the house is upset now. 
[01:49:30]  Everyone in the whole host.  Host.  This is not a host to do that in.  Well, I was asking them if they smoke marijuana.  Yeah, well, what do you think they're going to do?  Just tell you?  Sure, we're up in the host.  We smoked a lot of it.  There's a bunch of glass house-living, stone-throwing, glass-hoose-living, stone-throwers.  I don't disagree.  Look, I was helping you pass the turkey.  All right, sure.  Here, here.  Light this.  I got Thanksgiving up there.  Give me that stem.  Yeah.  Sam, go to CNN.com.  Okay.  That's a town.  Oh. 
[01:50:00]  I should leave.  Oh, maybe it runs until Typhoon.  Go down.  There's, like, a bunch of clips on the side a little further down.  There he is up top.  Wow.  Yours is...  Why is yours...  It's deaf, all right?  Oh, click on.  Click on.  Yeah, click on that.  And then on the left side, there's, like, three more clips.  Go with...  I'm not a drug addict.  I think there's more on that one.  Mayor Rob Ford, who admitted smoking crack cocaine in a drunken stupor, is now facing...  Stupor.  ...that he's become a...  I believe that what is about to happen should happen. 
[01:50:30]  A boop.  And, um, I'm sorry that you have gone through a turmoil in your life...  Sorry.  ...such as this.  And I ask these questions of you because I care.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And I think that's...  To have an intervention for the mayor of Toronto.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  The questions that, um, should question themselves.  Mr. Mayor, do you think you have an addiction problem with alcohol? 
[01:51:00]  Absolutely not.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, that's obvious.  Mr. Mayor...  Oh.  Do you think you have an addiction problem with substance abuse and illicit drugs?  Absolutely not.  All right.  Good by me.  Mr. Mayor, do you recognize that some of your behavior points to that?  I apologize for it.  Shut up.  Depends how you interpret my behavior.  Ha, ha, ha.  A few isolated incidents.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  A smoking crack. 
[01:51:30]  And yelling that you're going to kill somebody.  He's the best.  The arrogance of this guy is great.  I couldn't get enough of this yesterday.  And his suit jacket, he can't even, like, button it.  His tie isn't tied right now.  Would he survive...  He's obviously going to be done soon, but would he survive this if he came out and go,  I have a problem and I need help?  Hell no.  No one understands shit.  I mean, in Toronto, they're so nice up there.  And the way they're talking to him, would there be a way for him to skate this if he  came clean about everything? 
[01:52:00]  No.  Not even rehab, because you have to do your duty.  Or maybe if you did...  They want...  Do your duty.  They want him out.  They're just way more polite about it.  They absolutely want the guy out.  And they can't kick him out.  And they're saying that they need to make new legislation so they can kick him out.  So they can kick him out.  So now they're looking at trying to figure out the new legislation, and then officially  they can say, you've got to fucking go.  They don't want him around at all.  How much time does he have left before he'd have to leave anyway?  I don't know, to be honest.  That'd be great.  I'm very proud of Rob Ford's law. 
[01:52:30]  The law that says that you can now throw people out of office.  That'll be his legacy.  Right.  If they were caught smoking crack?  Yes.  Keep going there, Sam.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Oh, he's arrogant.  Oh, he's the best.  Okay, Councilor Mamalee, please speak to the mayor.  I'm trying to...  Madam Speaker, this is a very serious issue.  Okay.  I just...  Okay.  I can understand how people would perceive my behavior.  I can understand that.  Can you?  Because I put myself in the shoes of the taxpayers, and if they were to look at 
[01:53:00]  the few incidents that we've had, I could understand they would say he may have a problem.  I can assure you, I can assure you, I am not an alcoholic.  I am not a drug addict.  Have I drank?  Have I done drugs?  Yes, I have.  It's self-inflicted, and I hope, Councilor Mamalee, I hope...  I hope.  ...that nobody...  Nobody.  ...that nobody goes through what I have gone through in the last few months. 
[01:53:30]  It's him.  Mr. Mayor, you understand that there are some people on this council floor that really want  to give you an opportunity and to recognize that perhaps the stress and everything else  that comes along with addictions, possible addictions, points to particular behavior.  Mr. Mayor, do you recognize there are a few of us that really do want to help you?  Councilor?  I don't need help.  It was not...  The reason I drank or did drugs was not because of stress. 
[01:54:00]  It was out of sheer stupidity.  That's all it was.  So I'm not going to blame something.  When he puts his hands together...  And he talks, like, with that emphasis, he looks like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  With his suit jacket kind of stretching over.  Being sincere and putting his fingertips...  He puts just his fingertips together...  Yeah.  ...and kind of shakes his hands at you.  A lot of the Canadians checking in.  They're saying that Parliament absolutely wants him out.  Of course they do. 
[01:54:30]  But a lot of the people don't want him out.  Because I guess he has done some great things for Toronto.  His suit jacket won't even button.  No, no.  That's what I said.  Not that close.  If anyone, by the way, out there wonders, what is denial in an addiction?  I just want to do this.  That's right.  You'll never see a better example of denial.  Yeah, yeah.  Just show this, and it's a prime example.  And this is how...  Everyone who's in denial out there, this is exactly how obvious this shit is.  Wow.  To people around here.  Keep going.  I'm not going to use an excuse or a cop-out.  I take full responsibility for my mistakes. 
[01:55:00]  I don't know what else I can say.  Okay.  I don't know what else I can say.  Okay.  Okay.  There is no one else.  No one else to blame but myself.  No, there isn't anyone else to admit it except yourself.  And I admitted it over and over.  And I wasn't forced to admit it.  I came out, and I told the world, and I know I embarrassed the city.  He lied about it.  And then he goes, I know I embarrassed the city.  There had to be, not only did there have to be announcements that there is tape, the  tape had to surface before he even acknowledged that.  And then he used semantics saying, well, he didn't ask the question properly. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And that's on you, not me.  Yeah.  You asked me, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, and you should have asked me, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  He'll be in office until the fall of next year, according to John.  Thank you.  So he's got about a year left.  Wow.  Keep going.  Let me just say this to you.  The only person that could admit to having some kind of an addiction problem is the  person who has it.  Absolutely.  Mr. Mayor, to a person that does care, I say this to you. 
[01:56:00]  In Ward 7, we've spent 15 years trying to get rid of gangbangers.  We're trying to get rid of the influence that they bring on to our children.  Mr. Mayor, in the behavior that we have seen, some of us have seen, including myself, there  are pictures of individuals that don't do good to this city, that you seem to have a  relationship with.  Do you understand that even those of us that want to help you are really concerned about 
[01:56:30]  these things?  Counselor, this one isolated picture in front of the garage was a one-off picture.  I've never met those three men in my life.  They came out and asked me to take a picture with them, and that's the God-honest truth.  I have never met those people.  They're in court now.  I'm not part of gangbangers.  I do not support them.  But when someone comes out and says, let's take a picture, I will take a picture.  I met those people once, and I've never seen them again. 
[01:57:00]  Would you consider sitting down with your family, with perhaps a couple of us on the  council that really do want the best for you, and to talk about how perhaps we proceed instead  of, Mr. Mayor, instead of what's about to happen in this chamber.  I don't want to see it.  I don't think the city wants to see it.  Mr. Mayor, listen to me. 
[01:57:30]  I don't think the city wants to see it.  I think the best thing in this particular case is for us to talk to you and figure out  what it is, if anything.  Google it.  We need to do to proceed in this particular case without the stone-throwing, the yelling,  the screaming, and the embarrassment.  Okay, that was your last question.  Counselor, I have talked to my family.  I have talked to professionals.  Counselor, action speaks louder than words. 
[01:58:00]  Ah, that's right.  Like smoking crack.  What?  I've apologized.  I want to move on.  That's all I can say right now, Counselor, and I do appreciate your support and your sincerity.  Counselor Mehevich, question.  Oh, boy.  It doesn't stop.  Mr. Mayor.  Okay, so we've been listening to you.  The words are, I'm not addicted to crack.  Right.  The actions are, even though I'm the mayor, I'm smoking crack.  I'm smoking crack.  Yeah, yeah.  Was that the end of that clip? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Back to the anchor.  Yeah, look at the other.  Is that the main one?  And then there's three on the side.  Those are, I don't think these are from the, uh...  Here, go back a page.  He is fantastic to watch.  And then look on the left side again.  Yeah, because there's another one.  Oh, you click on that.  The sheer denial that he really did anything.  Oh, I see what you did.  Okay, all right, all right.  Oh, we have more of the, um...  Well, we got the...  Rob Ford.  Well, the other clip from yesterday where, uh, he was accused of bullying. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  Because I guess one of the guys from Parliament was trying to, I don't know, what, move up  front to ask a question or some procedural thing.  Oh, a wonderful procedure.  But Rob Ford was in his way.  Ah, and he wouldn't move.  And Rob Ford decided not to move and have a stare down with the guy, and he's a mere  of three inches from his face.  And he just would not move until someone broke it up.  And he is an immovable force, as they say.  And then they finally, uh, they finally went their separate ways, but then it had to be  brought up on the floor yesterday in Parliament. 
[01:59:30]  Mm.  Here, hit this clip.  The mayor stopped me, blocked my path.  He physically stood in my way, in a threatening way, and, uh, other councillors stopped us.  He ordered me to sit down.  He said, why don't you move your motion?  I had to explain to him that it's time to question staff.  He said, why don't you move your motion?  And I explained to him, I explained to him that I wanted to speak with you. 
[02:00:00]  He stood in my way and blocked my path in a threatening way, in a way that I have never  experienced on my time on this council.  You're too much, buddy.  You're too much, buddy.  Too much, buddy.  He's, he's demanding an apology.  Charles Terman and Wong asked for an apology.  Tattled on him.  He did.  Councilman and Wong indicated, um, that you, um, were threatening, Councilman and Wong. 
[02:00:30]  Now, I, as speaker, Percy did not hear it, and you were standing in front of me, uh, that  indicate that, in fact, that was the case.  So I'm asking Mayor Ford, if you can please apologize.  What is this about?  Watch this.  Mayor Ford.  I'm not a speaker.  I did not.  Right?  Oh. 
[02:01:00]  Are they supposed to sit in their seat when people are asking questions at staff?  Yes, sir.  Okay.  I asked him to take his seat.  He did not tell me he was going to talk to you.  He said, no, I'm not going to take my seat.  That was the conversation.  I did not threaten him.  And that's exactly what happened.  So I have nothing to apologize.  I want him to.  Wow.  Proper protocol is sitting in his seat when people are asking questions.  Quite a parliamentary procedure.  Right?  Yes.  Wow.  There's going to be another clip from this guy. 
[02:01:30]  That's great.  He said, fuck you.  Right?  Go fuck yourself.  I'll apologize for the crack shit, but, uh.  Right.  Not for that.  That guy's a little rash.  Got it snissed on him.  He is.  Make him feel sorry.  He said, I want him to apologize to me.  Fuck you.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the Opie Anthony channel.

[02:06:00]  No!  This is the worst of the week countdown.  And we highlight the great things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Sam Roberts.  Mike Tyson in studio still to come.  But right now, if you just listen to what we played a few moments ago,  it was Rob Ford at the city council meeting,  where he was just arguing and making a fool of himself.  If you thought it couldn't get any worse, it did.  If you haven't heard what he said after the city council meeting,  I'm almost positive that you have.  But if you haven't heard what his quote was on Thursday, 
[02:06:30]  I don't want to spoil it for you.  It was that good.  Here's the rest of the Mayor Rob Ford saga that went down this week.  This Rob Ford is just amazing.  I saw this video online yesterday.  Some people tweeted it to me.  And the second I watched it, I was like, okay, it's fake.  It's like those bad lip sync things that they do with people. 
[02:07:00]  I was like, no way he said this.  And then I was looking and going, no, the press is horrified.  He really said it with all the heat he's been catching of late.  But wouldn't you think maybe I shouldn't say this with the press everywhere?  That's why he's the greatest.  And he went to work in a football jersey yesterday.  What does it say?  Mayor Ford on the back, I think?  Yeah, it's a personalized football jersey.  He's amazing.  And the press up there, they could just be right outside your office door.  You don't get that in America. 
[02:07:30]  No.  So they just hang out waiting for him, and then he decides, okay, it's time.  It's time for today's circus.  And then he walks out of his office, and then he says some ridiculous shit.  That's the fucking ridiculous shit that he has to apologize for now.  And I can.  I got to say, obviously here in America, most of us did not know about Rob Ford.  No.  But I'm learning more and more that he's been a character for a really long time.  And when the whole crack thing went down, I don't know, about a year ago, I think it started at this point, 
[02:08:00]  or maybe just under a year, I thought the guy was a complete dick, asshole.  Like, what the fuck?  Get rid of him.  Now I just love the guy.  Do you know how low on the interest scale Canadian politics is to Americans?  Right.  I really can't stress to people enough how much we do not give a fuck or know anything about Canadian politics.  I don't know who runs Canada.  I don't even know.  I couldn't tell you how their system works.  Do they have a president?  Or is it one of those prime ministers or something? 
[02:08:30]  Are they one of those countries that wears wigs?  A premier, maybe?  Do they have wigs?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll tell you one thing.  Is it called Parliament?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Yeah, we don't know shit about Canadian politics, but we know a lot about Rob Ford now.  Because he's the man.  Yeah, at this point, one guy is running Canada.  Yeah.  Rob Ford.  His name's Rob Ford.  Rob fucking Ford.  I would give them all of Canada at this point.  He deserves it.  Let him run the show.  This is the longer clip, because he walks out of his office with his football jersey on, 
[02:09:00]  and he has a laundry list of things he needs to get off his chest.  He's got to address things.  Bullet points for the day.  Bullet points for the day.  I just love how matter-of-fact he is.  The first couple are like whatever, and then we get to the gold, obviously.  The meat.  Do you remember when Wiener gave the finger to the press?  Yeah.  Rob Ford is just, this is a two-week give the finger.  Yes.  He's having that meltdown moment.  He's had it.  That's continuing.  He'll eventually step aside, but this is great to watch him going down.  He's got to step aside. 
[02:09:30]  How much time do you have left on his gig?  A year.  A year.  You think he's going to try to survive?  I don't know.  Maybe he stays.  And without official criminal charges, they can't kick him out.  Right.  But we learned yesterday that they're trying to get new legislation in place, so then  they can kick him out.  Because officially they can't right now.  But he'll probably be grandfathered in.  You think?  Any mayor that publicly announces how much pussy he eats can no longer serve.  He's got plenty of pussy at home.  His poor wife.  Oh.  His wife's fucking... 
[02:10:00]  What did he say?  You can't throw your wife on the bus like that.  I would love to see that when he saw his wife right after that.  She was probably livid.  I don't know, man.  What the fuck are you doing?  I think Rob Ford found a cool woman to marry.  I don't know.  She was down there.  He's a lot of smoke crack.  He's a lot of threatened people.  She's standing next to him as he's apologizing.  Making the Michaela Maroney face.  Right.  Making that, hmm, hmm, hmm.  She's married to a fat crack smoker. 
[02:10:30]  Yes.  She understands his problems.  Oh, okay.  Maybe she knows.  He's obese and he's a crack smoker.  If he's a crack smoker, I mean...  Oh, he is.  He smokes crack.  A lot.  He has.  He definitely has.  Dude, when someone says...  But he still has all his teeth and he's still at a weight that is substantial as far as crack  using goes.  Because coming down, he probably eats a lot.  Oh, yeah.  It probably helps him binge.  I think he probably smokes some of the dope, too.  Yeah, probably.  That's where he gets the munchies.  You know why his wife's not mad at him. 
[02:11:00]  Because of the way he resolves all his arguments with her.  Eating a pussy.  That's right.  Yeah.  Let's play the clip.  Let's do this.  Litigation will be starting shortly.  I've had enough.  That's why I warned you guys yesterday.  Be careful what you wrote.  Okay, so that's all I have to say for now.  And the next thing, I want to call Mayor Britannia in Hamilton and tell him that we're going  to have to spank the little tiger cats.  Oh, and the last thing was Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life to her. 
[02:11:30]  I would never do that.  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go back.  I mean, obviously, we've got to laugh.  But the guy in the background makes the clip.  Because what did he say?  So I'm like, what did he just say?  Listen to the background.  Also, for those of you playing along at home, maybe with the clip, the reaction by the reporters,  especially the women, there's one Asian woman that just turns around like she can't imagine 
[02:12:00]  what just happened.  She can't find a Wi-Fi fast enough to get this clip up there.  Stunned.  Here, play it again.  Listen to the guy in the background.  He says...  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Go back a little.  Oh, yeah.  It was Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life to her.  I would never do that.  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you very much.  Why would he say that?  Why would he say that?  And then he just turns around and marches back to that office with two thugs, basically.  Yeah, yeah.  Two big time, big, huge, burly security guards.  Here's the thing with that clip.  You should know you shouldn't say that in front of the press.  Like, he doesn't even know that that's crazy to say? 
[02:13:00]  He knows.  Does he?  Yeah, yeah.  But when he gets back into his office, before he reads the feedback, is he thinking, good,  resolve that.  I got that out there.  We're not dealing with a dummy here.  I think he's highly intelligent.  Yeah, but I think he's a little crazy.  Well, he's a bit self-destructive, obviously.  If you're smoking crack when you're in a position like him, you have some self-destruction in your brain.  Right.  So that's part of it.  But he's fully aware of what he's doing.  Is he a good mayor?  The people, supposedly, I've done a little research. 
[02:13:30]  Supposedly, they love him because their taxes went down, which is very rare.  Like him.  Because he eats pussy.  That completely sums up what the people want.  You can eat all the pussy you want.  You can smoke crack.  You can threaten people in the city council.  Just lower my taxes.  Lower taxes.  That's all we need.  Right.  We're very forgiving.  Yeah.  So, can we hear the clip one more time?  Absolutely. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, there's a Rob Ford, Chris Farley mashup?  Joey and Canada checking in.  Wow.  Could someone pick up Joey on line one and find out where that is so we can play it?  Go ahead.  Hamilton, and tell them that we're going to have to spank the little Tiger Cats.  Oh, and the last thing was Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life to her.  I would never do that.  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home.  Thank you very much.  Anything that was real. 
[02:14:30]  Why did he say that?  But where does this come from?  I didn't even do it.  I didn't even.  You hear them laughing in the background?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They all enjoy it.  They know they've got a great clip.  Yeah, they love it.  Oh.  But who's this broad?  That said the Gondack?  Yeah.  And that's just it.  He said her name?  Yeah.  Like, he...  I think you're right.  That was a little calculated.  Wait, wait.  Hold on a minute.  He was an A-form oral sex? 
[02:15:00]  He said, eat her pussy.  Hold on.  People are picking out individual voices.  Finn and PA, go ahead.  Hey, man.  If you listen to the very last part of that clip, all the way at the end, there's one reporter  that says, I fucking love this guy.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's play it again.  We've got to be very quiet so we can hear this.  Thank you.  I have to spank the little tiger cats.  Oh, and the last thing was Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life to her.  I would never do that. 
[02:15:30]  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home.  Thank you very much.  Was there anything that was real?  Say that.  We need to drive it.  We need to drive it.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Oh, my God.  Can you kill me?  We might be playing live.  I love that guy.  I love that guy.  Who wouldn't if you were a reporter that's gold? 
[02:16:00]  Did you hear the laughter that came from them?  Oh, is that great?  I love that guy.  I love that guy.  They know that they're getting an absolute, every time his mouth opens, a gem is going  to fall out of it.  And it's so good that they're not even fighting with each other.  They're like, there's plenty for all of us.  Sure.  Don't worry about it.  That's like, he has plenty of pussy.  We got plenty of sound bites for everyone here.  Don't you worry.  We don't need an exclusive.  Nope.  I got plenty to eat at home.  Plenty to eat at home.  He's saying his wife has plenty of pussy. 
[02:16:30]  And then what?  Later on, someone said, look, man, you got to apologize for that immediately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't see the apology yet.  Oh, did he?  I heard it.  Yeah.  Here's the apology with his wife right next to him looking down and she's covering up  her pussy because everyone, she knows everyone's just staring at her pussy.  Yeah.  How big is it?  Look, look, her arm, her hands are over her pussy.  That's the pussy.  Oh, my God.  God, is he embarrassing his city?  Oh, he's the best.  I love him.  I absolutely love him. 
[02:17:00]  Yesterday, I mentioned it was the second worst day of my life except for the death of my  father.  Well, we're going to have to push it back.  The past six months, I have been under tremendous, tremendous stress.  Oh, boy.  Stress is largely of my own making.  I have apologized and I have tried to move forward.  This has proven to be almost impossible. 
[02:17:30]  The revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts, prostitution has pushed me over the line.  Pause.  This is just amazing.  We've been doing this a long fucking time.  And every once in a while, you get one of these stories that just has a life of their  own.  This is one of the best ones ever.  You know why?  It never gets this far in the United States.  Right. 
[02:18:00]  This guy would have been fucking gone already.  Sure.  And this is what happens when you allow this to play out.  Yeah.  It just is entertaining for everybody.  Yeah, let it play out because this guy's just fucking every day.  This is way better than any TV show you could fucking watch tonight.  He saved Richie Incognito.  Yes, he did.  We had an N-word story.  The press loves their N-word stories.  Oh, they love it.  Even this.  Pussy eating trumps anything.  Boy, man.  Prostitution has pushed me over the line. 
[02:18:30]  And I used unforgivable language.  And again, I apologize.  Again, again.  These allegations are 100% lies.  Well, when you attack my integrity as a father and as a husband, I see red.  Pink is on a period.  They acted on complete impulse in my remarks.  Well, boy.  I fully realize in the past, I have drank alcohol in excess. 
[02:19:00]  In the past?  In excess.  In the past few hours, maybe.  And he's got another...  Oh, my God.  He's still got another stupid fucking football tie on.  Yeah, football tie.  What football tie did I do?  It's just...  Now it's just footballs.  It's all I see.  Maybe he saw the room.  He loves football.  Oh, he's at the city...  American football, right? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  City of Toronto podium he's standing at.  Very proudly.  Oh, boy.  What a disgrace.  They're just going to start, like, taking the flag down out of the room.  Yeah, yeah.  Just slowly.  Maybe people won't know where he's from.  Yeah, put Montreal on there.  He can't see it.  Do you know that the CFL's in the playoffs right now?  I thought that's what he meant.  I had no idea.  But Eddie in Montreal, really fast.  Go ahead, Eddie.  Yeah, Eddie G.  Yeah, the Hamilton...  The Tiger Cats refers to Hamilton Tiger Cats. 
[02:20:00]  They're playing Toronto in the playoffs, in the CFL playoffs on the weekend.  Gophers.  He's saying they wanted to spank them because they want to beat them.  Oh, okay.  So it's a football thing.  Oh, yeah.  I had no idea.  Because he had the jersey on.  He's not going to go call the mayor of whatever.  Okay, gotcha.  Give him a razzle.  Got an extra ticket to the Gophers?  Are you kidding?  Why are you having your playoffs so early?  That's stupid.  Everyone knows you do it around the New Year.  Maybe because the NFL stuff beats up the...  Oh.  I'm just fucking around.  Oh.  Thanks, Eddie.  I'm giving you a literal CFL answer.  It's a great show, guys.  We love you.  Of course it is. 
[02:20:30]  I appreciate it.  Yeah, you're welcome.  Action me on Trey once in a while.  Hi to our Canadian fans.  I treat you guys all the time.  You don't listen.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  I'm too busy.  It's okay.  I still love you.  Eddie G on Twitter.  We read a lot of tweets.  It's just hard to get back to everybody.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We, you know, read you loud and clear or whatever.  We're eating pussy at home.  That's right.  Too busy eating the pussy.  You've got to stand in line behind the American tweeters that we answer first.  Yeah, they come in first.  Uh-huh.  All right, let's get back to this. 
[02:21:00]  Liquid gold here.  God, he's the best.  Would you interview him if you could?  I'm begging.  Let's get this done.  Would you fly up there?  I'd fly up there.  In a second.  I'd drive there to interview him.  I want to just hang out outside his office.  With the rest of the freak show.  Looks like a fucking party every day.  That's great.  He's not done.  My remarks.  I fully realize in the past I have drank alcohol in excess.  Okay.  I wish you to know I'm receiving support from a team of health care professionals. 
[02:21:30]  I am taking accountability and receiving advice from people with expertise.  That is a roundabout way.  I do not wish to comment on the particulars of this support.  I wish you to understand I am accepting responsibility for the challenges  I face.  I would ask you, please, please, respect my family's privacy. 
[02:22:00]  You're the one that said you eat your wife's pussy at home.  Respect the privacy.  You're the mayor who smokes crack on video.  He's incapable of taking responsibility and legitimately apologizing and making himself out as the bad guy in anything.  He's his own worst enemy.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he explained it perfectly.  Sometimes some people see red and then just blow up everything around them. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I might be one of those people every once in a while.  Where you just fucking can't take it anymore because all you see is the color red.  He's lied a lot.  But I'll say this.  There's something honest in his attitude.  Like, even though he's bullshitting about certain things, I'm sure, the fact that he said,  I'm sorry about my language, and then keeps going, it's not groveling.  Right.  Like, I don't feel like he's groveling.  Yeah, but that's because he's lost his mind.  It doesn't matter.  There's something I like about it.  I'm saying, like...  But he's not saying...  Did you hear the way he said he's seeking assistance and that? 
[02:23:00]  He's not saying help.  Well, he's in denial.  He's not saying he needs help with that.  Yeah, well, exactly.  That's just it.  He's in denial.  And it's all about him as far as, like, he's the victim here.  Right.  Like, you know, hey, respect our privacy.  You're the guy that...  He doesn't want anyone to respect his privacy because he's just signed up to do a TV show.  Yeah.  How is he going to get privacy when now he's all in?  Obviously, it's going to be some kind of reality show with his brother, and it starts up next week.  Do you think people will watch it?  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:30]  I pray that we get it here in America somehow.  And the laughs will be where he doesn't mean for them.  He won't do crack.  Like, he won't crack.  But the thing...  He'll do certain things that he won't understand how great he is.  Right, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't even realize that people are just going to destroy him every single week.  Right.  And he's not...  People are going to be laughing at him.  Yes.  I feel that he's one of those guys, though, that just, you know, as it really starts heating up him, he'll just drop dead or something.  You think?  Yeah.  Hmm.  I mean, he definitely is not a guy who shows self-control. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Dr. Drew could help him.  Help speed up the process.  So I can't wait to see what he says today.  Because every day he's got to say something.  So hopefully today...  Oh, yeah.  Could you have predicted anything like this?  What do you mean?  Even that he, yesterday, would go out and say that?  No.  No one could have.  But he's also threatening lawsuits, too.  You know?  Yeah.  But, like, anything that you could make up about him in a newspaper is nowhere near as good as what he actually says. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And we didn't even play all the clips from their parliament.  Yeah.  You know, the Air Canada one is really fucking funny.  What was that one?  Something about he's not going to get drunk there anymore or something.  Do we have that?  We tried to find it the other day.  It was being...  It was played everywhere.  But we couldn't find it when we needed to yesterday.  His accent makes him great, too.  He's so entertaining to listen to.  Again?  And then that dramatic bullying incident where he wouldn't move out of the way of Wong.  Was it Wong?  Yes. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, on the floor.  He just stood there in front of him.  Right.  So, I don't know.  If you find more Rob Ford clips, please.  And what's that Chris Farley thing?  Do we know?  Another guy saying...  Actually, Jody.  Jody saying...  Jody in Canada.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Oh, you again.  Are you the Jody from the Bryan Adams song?  Like Jimmy quit and you got married?  No, no, but it is the same Jody from Canada that phony guys like me.  I know.  Why do you have that girl's name?  It's weird. 
[02:25:30]  I fucking don't know my grandma named me.  I'm sorry.  Is that a popular name in Canada for guys?  No.  Jody.  Actually, not for a guy, no.  Probably one of the only ones you guys should.  All right.  We got something in common with your country.  We don't call guys Jody.  We'll name them Jody.  That is a girl's name right there.  Jody, by the way, name was the little girl in the Amityville Horror named the pig in the  window that she would see Jody.  Oh.  I think we finally found the Chris Farley mashup.  The pig in the window. 
[02:26:00]  You know that?  Oh, no.  Sorry.  I don't mean that towards E-Rock at all.  I know.  It's terrible.  Did you guys find the Chris Farley mashup?  They kicked Rob Ford out of the Santa Claus parade?  Why?  Does he do that every year?  Why would you kick him out?  He should be a parade marshal.  Grand marshal.  Let me find out.  Mermin?  Yeah, he got the boot from Santa's parade and the football team says, hey, buddy, don't  be wearing our shirt no more in public.  Oh, man.  He got the boot from the parade. 
[02:26:30]  I could listen to you all day.  Yeah, what is the Santa Claus parade?  Oh, it's a big thing in Toronto.  It's pretty big, man.  There's six million people there, so they have a big parade.  He goes there, but they said, buddy, like, don't be coming here no more.  Well, it's the political scheme.  Wow.  All right.  Shit, man.  Shit happens.  Shit happens.  He would make a perfect Santa Claus, too.  Yeah.  Just throw that beard on him?  Yeah.  Just get the fucking Coke sweats.

He just put out his book telling his story.  It's fantastic.  Mike Tyson returns to the Opie and Anthony studio.  Here it is.  Number one.  You grew up in a pretty, uh, I always read the childhood stuff.  Usually childhood stuff in a biography, you're like, all right, but this was, fuck it. 
[02:32:30]  I could not get enough of the childhood stuff.  Holding a gun at like, what, like eight, nine years old, you were carrying, you had a pistol.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A little cheap-ass .38.  At eight.  Nine years old.  Yeah.  It's different.  Can't even imagine that.  It's just what you do.  It's just what you do.  It's just the people, the older people in your life, that's what they do.  That's the end of this.  You're watching them do things in the street.  You watch them snatch things.  And you, and these are people who are nice.  This is uncle such and such.  They're aunt.  Oh, so it's.  And they're good people to you, but to some other parts of the world. 
[02:33:00]  Uh-huh.  Not so good.  Wow.  And your mother and her boyfriend, uh, there was really good stuff about, uh, you saw her  throw boiling water on them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She scored them with boiling water.  Wow.  Wow.  And what did you say?  Like, he went to the liquor store for her or something.  And then you're like, that's explained my dysfunction with women.  No, um, after she did this stuff and they would have fights, he would go and buy her  liquor and cigarettes, like, reward her for doing fucked up shit.  Wow.  What the hell is that about?  Because he may say, well, I did bad things to her too. 
[02:33:30]  So this is, you know.  Make up for it.  This is crazy.  I have to, but this is how I live my life too.  A little dysfunctional, yeah.  A little bit.  You know, you would think this is your worst enemy, but I loved him.  Please don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  I know I punch you in the face, baby.  But don't leave me.  Take my money.  Take my wallet.  Please take my card.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't go.  Oh, wow, that, yeah, yeah.  You're comfortable in that fucking uncomfortable.  Right, right, right.  And then when things are going well, you say, this is not normal. 
[02:34:00]  This is sick.  You start getting uncomfortable when it gets too normal.  This is really sick.  My kids are in a great school.  Right.  Their mother's doing well.  We have maids.  We have servants and stuff, but this is not cool.  I've got to screw the maid.  I've got to do something else.  I've got to screw the maid.  I've got to screw the maid's daughter or something.  You've got to fuck things up.  Oh, man.  This is just too good.  Maybe I'll get up pregnant and we'll have a real big Brady Bunch.  Arnold Schwarzenegger wound up doing that.  Fuck the maid and look what happened. 
[02:34:30]  Made a little Arnold.  Yeah, that's, wow.  Did you look, though, was there any sense of that isn't right?  As a kid, you're seeing all this fucked up shit going around.  And I understand it's like, well, that's the way things are.  But was there anything in your head that made you think, wow, there's something wrong here?  Well, not really, because if you think about it, you know, the biggest stars in the world,  old grown men, people who you think were supposed to be respected, they've done it before you.  Maybe older guys who were successful and they were saying, hey, this is how you treat a woman. 
[02:35:00]  This is what you do.  Don't let her take up your hand.  And this is just what it's always been.  It's always been a male misogynist kind of world, especially America.  You know, so it's been that kind of male orientated.  You know, don't let that bitch play you.  You're the man of the house.  You're from your rib.  God made up from your rib, nigga.  I read that in the Bible.  Right.  Just like that.  Just like that.  Yeah, exactly.  They're pimping in the Bible.  You know what I mean?  But that's when you see, normally you see preachers and stuff, it's like preacher slash pimps 
[02:35:30]  because they dress the same, drive the same car, look at the weight.  That's funny.  Yeah, they do.  Greasy hair, they're looking good.  You think about it.  Yeah.  You think about it.  You're like pimping up there in the church.  Most pimps know the Bible real well.  Yeah.  But you escaped all that and made something of yourself.  No, maybe.  I don't know.  Did I escape it?  I think so.  Did I escape it?  For the most part, yeah.  Maybe physically.  Physically, I escaped.  My parents escaped that.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not in the same vernacular.  I'm not in the same neighborhood.  Right.  I still have the same characteristics.  Well, you used to go back to the neighborhood when you started making it, too. 
[02:36:00]  Absolutely.  You were just addicted to going back to that world?  Have you ever tried to figure that one out?  No.  It's my insecurities.  I just want them to know they're never tougher than me.  Yeah.  Even though I have this, I'll still stomp you down.  I guess I always had that mentality.  I never wanted to be bullied again.  I never wanted to think because I'm not in this environment.  You could just say, oh, he's soft.  And I never wanted to have that appearance that he's soft and he can't come to Brown.  I don't want them no more. 
[02:36:30]  Uh-huh.  And I always wanted to know that I'm always here.  And there's always a possibility that I'll do something real bad to you.  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  It seems...  I was going to say, there's also something about going back home.  You're coming from a place...  There's always something to fucking prove.  I don't care if it's a white neighbor or a...  Right, right.  You're right.  That's it.  You're leaving there with these dreams and hopes that you're going to do something.  And you think they want you to do it.  They want you to fail.  Right, right.  Because you know, I don't care what neighborhood, what nationality, they come out, oh, you thought 
[02:37:00]  you were going to make it.  Now you're back.  You're back with us.  Yeah.  Fucking piece of shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when you go back, it's almost like, yeah, fuck you.  Look what I did.  But it doesn't help.  It doesn't...  No, it doesn't.  No one cares.  But it's only within your own head that existence exists.  Yeah.  But you don't have to physically travel back home to resolve that in your own head, you  know?  You never know.  For some people, they do.  Yeah.  But were you going back there when you were really famous?  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  With my Rolls Royce.  No bodyguards.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm one of the guys.  And you always...  And our neighborhood is always the doggy dog.  You always have to...  And that's crazy when I think about...  That's why you always have to have that feeling or that aura that I will still do something  very bad to you.  Right, right.  You always have to have that.  It's amazing to me how many times you almost blew it.  Like when I'm reading the book, there's a lot of times you went back and these things  that you almost did when you were starting to get really famous about you were going to  rob houses and your friend... 
[02:38:00]  Fucking yeah.  He saved you.  And it's like no matter how well you're doing, there's that part that almost wanted to self-destruct.  There's always...  You know, in every neighborhood, there's always somebody that probably had played sports and  you never knew he played sports or he almost had it or he did something and he lost it.  And he said, hey, listen, man, don't do this.  And he said, you know, Mike, I used to play.  I used to box.  You know, I didn't have it, but I almost made it, man.  But I got caught up with drugs.  I got caught up with this case or something, man.  And they used to go back to those white people, man. 
[02:38:30]  They love you.  Go back to those white people, Jesus.  Yeah, man, I wish I had some white people that love me.  God damn.  That's just what they're saying.  That's pretty much what it is.  Right, right.  That's what it is.  Damn.  That's unbelievable.  It makes you wonder how many people almost made it out and went back one too many times  and didn't.  Oh, right.  Oh, absolutely.  Somebody may have killed them.  I always remember the gentleman, Len Byers.  He went back to celebrate and died of a drug overdose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  I remember that one.  Demons always follow us.  I don't care who you are, how successful you are.  That's why they're demons.  They don't go anywhere. 
[02:39:00]  They never leave.  Even if you have them under control, they're still there.  They're still there, right over your shoulder.  Demons don't go anywhere.  Whoever said they killed their demons are lying.  They never leave.  They never leave.  A constant battle.  Yeah.  God damn, man.  I'm amazed at the bullying too.  There's a lot of stuff about being bullied as a kid.  And it was real bullying and horrible bullying and the things that they would call you.  It's hard to picture you going through that as a person. 
[02:39:30]  Well, you know, when I was younger, I always hung out with my sister and her friends.  My brother's five years older and I was overweight.  You know, like I said, I was chubbier and I would look like this, you know, little kid.  And just people were just always gummy fairy, would kick my ass, just talk crazy to me.  I never fought before.  You know what I mean?  But something that was just so weird, you know, that it's really strange.  I was just good at fighting.  No one had to teach me. 
[02:40:00]  Boom.  Oh, so when you had to fight, you were good at it.  And I grabbed him, bite him.  It just came on naturally.  Don't mess with this fucking kid anymore.  That's why I realized some things do come.  Fighting do come naturally.  We're born to fight.  We're born to be killers.  You know, we just, some people transform into something else they don't want to do.  But we're born to do this stuff, I believe.  To defend ourselves.  There was the one story you told.  It was one of the worst ones.  What is that bullshit? 
[02:40:30]  What does it say right there?  This is a strange channel.  Mike Tyson, former boxing champion.  You're doing the closing bell today.  Oh, fuck nigga.  Nigga.  Please say that there.  Please yell at me.  Oh, nigga.  I'm a bad nigga.  Yeah, they get the big celebrities to do the closing bell.  You're doing it today.  You know what would be really funny?  I used to know, listen, I was just number one in the end celebrity.  I was always like the black celebrity. 
[02:41:00]  The black celebrity said, no, we're going to stay away from that.  You know, white people won't like us if we're with Mike.  You know, let's stay away.  Right when the bell rings, just turn around and clock the head of NASDAQ right in the head.  Oh, like.  You fucker.  Like it gets the fucking bell.  Ding, ding.  Bam.  Oh, that would be a great news story for the night.  Oh, that would be some beautiful news story.  You know, I'd probably have no bell when I get in jail.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That would be a rough one.  Mike's promoting, by the way, Undisputed Truth.  The Undisputed Truth.  His book is out.  I'm about 350 pages into it. 
[02:41:30]  It's absolutely amazing.  Right now, how old are you now?  I'm 45.  45.  So you're dealing with that middle-aged crisis, so you're trying to fuck it out of you, right?  That's what it is.  You get that middle-aged crisis, you just want to stroke.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You just want to stroke.  Them strokes are going to get that pain.  Oh, I'm too old.  I'm not even fucking it out of me.  I'm just tugging it out of myself.  I wish I had the dignity of fucking it.  I'm just pulling it out of my own dick and then closing the text message.  It really is a detached, awful cyber existence.  Closing the text.  Yeah, there's no real interaction with anybody. 
[02:42:00]  Listen, check this out.  Have you found anybody that just knocked you off your feet?  You like me?  Yeah, I found a few.  I found a few over the years.  No, no.  There's always going to be that one that you say,  Hey, this is crazy.  This is where our really pigish, chauvinistic instincts come in.  Hey, I don't want no one else to do what I'm doing to her.  You just come over here and hang out here for a while.  It's not so much that I don't want to do this to anyone else. 
[02:42:30]  You don't want her doing it to anyone else.  Yeah, but listen, that's just what happens to people who have been single for a long time  until we find out something that's not good with these people  and we can throw them back into the little fish shell there.  But other than that, man, we should hold on to them and see what happens.  A little magic might work there.  I think this guy, he don't want to believe in this stuff,  but I think he'd be an awesome, responsible guy  because he's an extremist and shit with all that stuff.  I believe if he focused that on just really caring about an entity and stuff, 
[02:43:00]  he'd be a monster.  Jimmy is really a solo kind of guy.  Mike thinks about sex a lot.  Yeah, a lot.  He wants to believe that because he doesn't believe that he'll do well in it.  You know, he's scared to go through and make the mistakes  and far the relationship are concerned.  You know, he's scared of the mistakes because we're all going to make mistakes.  I love psychoanalyzing Jimmy with Mike Tyson.  This is great.  Yeah, but he's right.  I mean, you know, I'm very bad at that stuff.  Because you've chosen a career path that is very solo, stand-up comedy. 
[02:43:30]  I think you're very caring and stuff, but you don't want kids  because you don't like changing anything that you think might be detrimental  to your career or self.  Or sexual addiction.  And it's also unselfish.  So you don't want to put somebody else through that.  I know how I am, and I don't want to be a pig.  But there's people that want to be a part of that witch  and you just go through that witch.  Ain't that some bullshit?  You want to go through this painful life?  Yeah, right.  Who wants to do that?  Stable life.  You want to endure this shit?  But maybe that stable life is not cool for them.  They want to help somebody.  They want to help you, Jimmy. 
[02:44:00]  I've had girls tell me their problems and really very emotional stuff.  And I've caught myself darting my eyes off to the television.  That just proves right there.  I have no fucking compassion.  No, I'm like the hump, Ben.  Just keep your problems to yourself, okay?  Don't tell me your problems, okay?  Because I got my own.  If your problems intertwine with mine, I might kill you, okay?  Mike, how do you get girls in prison? 
[02:44:30]  That amazes me.  Oh, man.  Well, um...  How did that all come about?  Okay, um...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, people, um...  Believe it or not, I was Mike Tyson.  And people kind of like wrote me pen pal letters when I was in jail.  And you just get a lot of people to look the other way.  They said, no, no one always looked.  I always got in trouble because I touched and kissed too much and stuff. 
[02:45:00]  But there was a guy in prison.  There's always some fucking white guy in these prisons.  He's got the system down, packed.  Even though he's always in fucking prison.  He never gets...  He always gets caught.  But he got the system packed down.  He said, this is what you do.  You have them come.  You know, there's some address that they wear.  There's some address they hear.  And the button's in the front, right?  You remember the button's, of course, in the front.  Have them wear it backwards.  No underwear unless...  Sometimes they'll check for underwear.  And you got to come to prison on underwear.  Make the underwear crotchless.  They never check the fucking crotchless underwear.  Oh, shit.  Oh, these fucking guys.  These fucking...  Wow.  That's why your white guys run the country. 
[02:45:30]  Because your motherfuckers think of this shit.  Right?  So, um...  He, um...  It's a crap thing.  And then...  No, I'm serious, right?  Who would think?  Who would some white motherfuckers think of this shit, right?  And, um...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, but really, right?  And I'm like, you're listening to me.  Are you listening to me, Mike?  All right, listen, all right?  Fuck, all right?  Listen, damn.  I'm getting in trouble for this, all right?  I haven't fucking kids since I've been in prison.  I can't go to sit.  Oh, man.  So, he goes like this.  He says, you have them turn around.  And you have them...  And the best...  You have them unbuttoned atop. 
[02:46:00]  And they come for that quick couple of seconds.  They can give you a kiss and sit on your lap.  And you have them come in and kiss.  And you're sitting here.  Put them right on there.  And you're...  And you're...  And you got to come real quick.  And you haven't had sex in a long time.  Unless you've been jerking off.  You've been jerking off, Mike.  Don't do that.  But I'm like, you're going to come real quick.  And then I sit, Mike.  Then you turn it down.  So, basically, that's how I did it.  And then, again...  I can't believe I'm talking about this shit.  But anyway...  Fucking...  So compelling. 
[02:46:30]  Jesus.  It's amazing.  I'm amazed.  Mike is the perv.  Perv.  Perv you perv.  Okay?  So, um...  Just had a girlfriend.  I had a little counselor there and stuff.  This is...  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's handy.  My brother's a counselor.  So, I said...  She kept saying, I can help your time...  Cut some of your time off if you take my test.  I said, I don't need your damn test and stuff.  And then, I know, it's possible I could get some.  Hey, yes.  I think I did have a lot of drinking problems.  And I dealt with drugs in the past.  And maybe me, you, could work something out.  And I can get help.  Because I tried to take the G.E.T. test. 
[02:47:00]  And that would take some time.  But I fucking failed the test.  Oh, my.  Okay?  I said, fuck.  God damn.  I can't even pass a fucking G.E.T. test.  Fuck.  What happened?  So, the counselor.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yes.  God.  Yeah.  Offered money and stuff.  Oh, man.  I'm always paying.  You know, I'm always a quick guy to pay.  My mother accept money.  Most of the women I know accept money.  And if you didn't accept money, I didn't like you.  So, you know something wrong with you.  You got morals? 
[02:47:30]  Uh-uh.  You don't got morals.  You got a venereal disease.  I don't want to be with you.  Everything.  Obviously, you went through a point in your life where you believed everything was for sale.  Everything is for sale, but every price is the money.  Everything is for sale.  Okay.  All right.  Sometimes money isn't the price.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Sometimes you have to love somebody.  Sometimes you have to...  You know, it's just all not for sale by money.  Everybody has a price, but it's not money.  Wow.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  That is a fucked up little story. 
[02:48:00]  And it's a very...  The drug counselor is supposed to fucking be there to, you know, help you out in another  way.  She was.  She was.  She was helping him out.  Yes.  She helped him out in that way.  Let me judge you, motherfucker.  Let me judge you, motherfucker.  Let me judge you, motherfucker.  Let me judge you, motherfucker.  White people.  You're the one that taught me how to do this shit.  It was you.  You guys look a lot like you.  Absolutely.  And then you go into detail about Desiree Washington in the book.  Wow.  Yeah.  A lot more than the one-man show, by the way.  Because the one-man show is only an hour and a half.  You can't really...  By the way, it's on started. 
[02:48:30]  To interrupt you, it's on 8 o'clock on HBO Films, Undisputed Truth.  It's called...  It airs on HBO Saturday, and it's fucking amazing.  It's amazing.  I saw it twice, and it's an amazing show.  I haven't seen it on HBO.  Of course, man.  Of course.  Yeah, I went, too.  Amazing.  Jeez.  I was there, Mike.  But you don't get the same energy that he's had, you know?  He comes up, hey, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, I'm really good, Mike.  That fucking jittery energy is beautiful.  You see it, man?  It's just described Jimmy's perfect.  How do you get the blink down?  He's got me.  He's got me.  Mike ties his Jimmy impressionist swear. 
[02:49:00]  It's great.  I actually went home, and he went backstage, and I'm like, I don't want to bother him.  Just tell him I liked it, too.  I loved it, actually.  But you really get into the Desiree Washington stuff in the book, which was...  It explains things that you seem like, when you hear things on the news, you're like,  how does this happen?  And then you go through every detail about the fucking...  I was so angry reading this book about the fucking defense attorneys and about Desiree,  and you explain everything, and it makes complete sense how it happened.  Like, it's stuff that I had no idea.  Hey, man, you know, at that time in my life, I was acting like a real prick, you know? 
[02:49:30]  So all that stuff with bad karma and stuff, it really came back to haunt me.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of bad karma and disrespecting people back then, because I'm the fucking baddest man  and the planet it was, right?  Right, right.  Baddest motherfucker kicked your ass.  And all that shit just comes back to haunt you.  You have bad karma, and you run into some other people with some bad shit.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Did you ever get the feeling that, I don't know, society on the whole just wanted to put 
[02:50:00]  you in check?  Well, you know, it's just me feeling sorry for myself, I think that way.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I have a lot of that to do with my conduct.  You know, I wanted to be a guy uncheckable.  Right, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You talk a lot about yourself, too.  Like, you look back and you're like, I was a selfish pig.  I was disgusting.  Like, you really go back and kind of analyze yourself, you know, in ways that we do that  are honest.  Like, I was behaving a certain way, and this is what I was.  But it's good to have that ability to see that.  Well, you know, I see that.  I don't conduct myself that way now, and I see the different results. 
[02:50:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know, and if I was continuing to act in that particular conduct, I would still have  the same results.  And were there people back then telling you to act in a specific way, and you were like,  hey, fuck you.  I know everything.  Yeah, pretty much.  Motherfucker, you ain't win no motherfucking title, nigga.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  You ain't never done shit, and you got all the best advice in the world.  Right.  You know, that's it.  And then after a few years, like, no, that motherfucker was right.  Shit.  I was just wrong.  You know, I was just wrong. 
[02:51:00]  I mean, we don't have enough time, but I'm assuming that you're relieved that you got  the Desiree Washington story now in this book for everyone to read, because there's  a lot to it that people just didn't know.  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  You're interrupting the Mike Tyson interview.  Oh, here comes fucking Thomas Jefferson.  Black Jim.  It's fucking...  But it's got to be good that it's on the record now, in your words.  I'm just...  Really?  No.  It doesn't mean nothing about that.  I'm just happy that it's over.  Yeah, no shit. 
[02:51:30]  You know, I'm just happy that it's over.  It's going to always be there.  And regardless of what people think about it, I really...  That's just not who I am.  It's not in my system no more.  I'm just moving on in my life.  Nice.  Obviously, yeah.  I don't have to have no plastics.  I believe she had plastic surgery.  She got changed up job.  I used to have to do that.  When I come in and walk in the world, I walk who I am.  This is me, Mike Tyson.  This is what you get.  And that's how it's always going to be.  Did you ever see yourself in this position earlier on in your career? 
[02:52:00]  Were you ever thinking, wow, when I'm done boxing and I get a little older, maybe I'll  wise up a little bit?  No, I didn't think I lived that long.  Oh, really?  Who would want to think about it?  I was living like a rock star.  Who would want to be an old rock star?  And then you realize being an old rock star is kind of cool.  Yeah, Mick Jagger's going to be blown.  Fuck, Nicky!  He's beautiful.  I see Ron Stewart, too, right?  Yeah, yeah, he's still...  Rango, tango, jango. 
[02:52:30]  Goddamn Mike Tyson.  Holy shit.  Do you have people in your life or anyone...  Because you said you were using for a long time.  I don't know if anybody called you on it.  Do you have...  You said Cuss died and then your sister died.  People who would really rip into you when you...  And people, you need that, like people who care about you enough to risk losing you.  I don't know.  Who's going to tell the youngest heavyweight and the champ what to do?  And everybody telling what he does is great.  No, no, I mean now.  Do you have friends that will go like, oh, my son. 
[02:53:00]  My friends, fuck, my wife will kick me in the ass.  My friends, please.  My wife is my biggest fucking watchdog.  Fucking pit bull city, dude.  Yeah.  Man.  Today my wife would think, I almost fell in love with you again.  When I saw you last night on stage talking with the woman of the library.  I almost fell in love with you again.  And then I realized, you're just a manipulator.  You're just a manipulator.  You don't care.  You would have kicked your daughter in the face if she came on stage to steal your thunder.  You don't care. 
[02:53:30]  You're just selfish and you have some megalomania.  And I said, where is this coming from?  Because you almost had me fooled that you were a wonderful guy.  I said, come on, stop, baby, okay?  She was always going to bust my job.  She said, today I was saying, I'm not going today.  Because you're not going to iron my stuff and stuff.  I'm not going to take no shower.  She said, you wouldn't miss the moment to be on radio and television, to be with Howard Stern and Annie.  You would never miss that moment.  I don't believe.  I think there's some shit. 
[02:54:00]  It's nice, though, isn't it?  To have somebody who kind of knows that we're full of shit sometimes and likes us anyway.  There's something really comforting about that.  They like us anyway.  They want to kiss us with our morning stinking shit fucking gasoline smelling breath, right?  Wolf thing breath and they still want to kiss us.  Tongue like sandpaper and they still want to kiss us.  That's how you know you're in love.  When you have to shit and you don't have to make up an excuse like you're going to shower, 
[02:54:30]  that's how I know I'm in a comfortable relationship.  And you shit, you want to run to bed real quick and you don't have time to wipe to get the strokes in.  That's white boy nasty.  Black people would never like me to talk about that.  That's some real fucking dingy dude, man.  You're a fucking dingy dude.  We got to get Mike out of here for another interview, unfortunately.  Oh, no, come on.  This is the place.  Oh, man.  It's not up to us.  Because once I leave this place, I'm going to be, you know, pretty much Uncle Tom Mike.  Yes, ma'am? 
[02:55:00]  Directly speaking, yes, I did appropriate it.  Yes, thank you very much.  I would like to talk about that.  This shit's going to change, man.  I'll be ringing the bell at the stock market later this afternoon.  The closing bell.  And I'm very grateful.  All of them very petitious white people really are willing to have me here and join them.  And this is something that will be a highlight of my career.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm trying to show gratefulness by being very gratitude for this moment.  And I'm conveying gratitude.  Well, good for you, Mike.  Good for you.  Sir, by any chance, may I wipe your ass, please? 
[02:55:30]  I will manicure your pubic hair in your ass, sir.  I'm built to do this.  Oh, man.  He's a new man.  This is the Mike Tyson we've been waiting for.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Please, please.  I'll pick your cotton in South Carolina as well.  That's the best you got from us.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.

Thanks for listening to the You Know What Dude podcast.  Dude, I listened to the podcast on the Opie and Anthony channel, man. 
[03:00:30]  They edited some stuff out, dude.  It wasn't the complete thing.  You want the whole podcast unedited?  Go to riotcast.com for the whole episode in its entirety.  Riotcast.com.  Bob Kelly.  You know what, dude?  Go get it.  All right, you guys.  This is the main group right now.  We've got special.  My Artie Lang impression.  I love it.  Where's Nick DiPaolo when you need him? 
[03:01:00]  We've got special guests tonight, guys.  You guys know them, right, Dan?  Yeah.  Have you met?  You've met Bailey before.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton.  Have you met anybody in show business, Louis?  Do you know anybody?  Who do you know besides Big J and the legions of skanks?  Ah, fuck you.  Two people said woo.  Do you know Jim Norton?  I mean, I know of Jim Norton.  I get nervous every time he's around me.  Why?  I don't know.  He's a real comic.  I don't know any real comics. 
[03:01:30]  Aw.  A real life comic.  Louis isn't a real comic.  All right, let's bring these guys out.  One of them is my great friend I've known since I came to New York City.  He's one of the funniest guys on the planet Earth.  That's just fucking it.  And then the other one I fell in love with, watching porn.  Fuck you, I have.  And she's actually one of the funniest people I know.  Her and her husband have a great podcast on the Riotcast Network. 
[03:02:00]  Very interesting, funny, and she's beautiful.  So, let's give it up for Jim Norton and Bailey Jay, everybody.  Jim Norton and Bailey Jay.  Jim Norton and Bailey Jay.  Bailey, you're right here.  What's up?  You're right here.  Jim's right here.  Jim's right here.  You're right there, sweetie.  Jim, you're right here.  Keep it going.  Just applaud.  Can Louis stay off the show? 
[03:02:30]  Don't let him bully you into applauding.  Yeah.  What's going on, Jim?  You only applaud if you feel like applauding.  Hi, Bob.  Okay.  What an event.  This is pretty good, right?  Yes.  It's just fun watching you try to be charming.  You know what?  This dude really sucks.  Stop.  I'm kidding.  Go ahead.  Give him a hand.  It's like watching La Mata.  Remember in Raging Bulls?  I thought you were going to be...  I was going to go with Jim Norton and Bailey Jay and then see you guys come up from the  fucking hallway over there. 
[03:03:00]  Exactly.  You wiping your mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me handing over money.  Thanks.  Bailey, you are looking fantastic tonight, by the way.  Thank you.  You were looking at my tits while you said that, actually.  You know, it's hard to look at you sexually anymore because we're friends.  I know.  You've heard me talk and that's probably a really big turnoff, I'd imagine.  No.  No.  Your voice is what turns me on.  Oh, thank you.  I used to watch your videos for, you know, scientific purposes.  Right, right.  And now I know your husband and I know that you only do...  You only do...  If you're in a porn with a guy, it's only your husband's dick. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  So every time I've seen you on a...  Which is only a couple times in a porno, I've been looking at Matt's dick.  You've just been jerking off to my husband's cock, basically.  Yeah.  I'm all right with that.  I want to know how it feels to actually listen in on this very secret part of Bob Kelly.  Well, the funny thing is, my wife...  You came over the first time.  My wife was like, yeah, bring her over.  And she made sausage soup. 
[03:04:00]  Ironically, yeah.  But not intentionally.  It was just...  All of a sudden, I looked over, Jim and me are eating sausage soup.  And I'm like, oh my God.  Yeah, of course it was intentionally.  She just wanted to watch how much you enjoyed eating it.  You know how many times your wife probably watches you sleep and just stands there with a knife and goes,  I want to fucking kill him.  Don fucking loves me, man.  She does love you, but she probably has those fucking Carl and Sling Blade moments.  She's just standing there with a Kaiser Blade, thinking of gutting you. 
[03:04:30]  Tired of you.  Wait.  Well, the funny thing is, is that you're like our son.  Oh my God.  I'm not kidding, because every holiday, Jim doesn't have...  He doesn't go to his family.  So we lived in the same building for years.  And then we moved to another place.  We bought a place in Manhattan, whatever.  But...  Fucking doorgasm money.  Real estate body.  And Jim, we invite Jim over for every holiday, Thanksgiving.  Any holiday, he comes over and eats with us. 
[03:05:00]  Holiday.  Holiday.  And it's pretty much, you come over and my dog flips the fuck out.  Because my dog likes him better than he likes me.  It's because I'm lonely.  What do you mean you're lonely?  I just...  I don't have a girl.  I've been single for a while.  And I just...  I'm lonely.  I need people in my life.  Talk it on the microphone, you jizzbag.  You do this for a living.  What am I doing?  I'm just trying to get used to this fucking Bela Lugosi lighting you have on us.  What is it? 
[03:05:30]  What kind of mood lighting is this?  You know what, dude?  I want it to feel like a Turkish place of prostitution.  I want the audience to lose focus and eat and not know exactly where we are.  I love it.  This is the thing, though.  I got the fucking Lewis and Dan both just starstruck because you assholes are on the show.  No, you're back, you fucking Puerto Rico.  I'm trying to fight off of me.  You're boxing me out.  Sorry, Dan.  You're like, you're a shack on the Lakers.  I can't get around you.  Talking to the fucking microphone. 
[03:06:00]  I'll turn.  I'm talking into the mic.  Yeah, Bobby, I need to look in your eyes.  What did you say?  I got to look in your eyes.  I don't like this, like, line up like we're a fucking press conference for a meeting competition.  What did you do, Lewis?  Why are we here?  What do you want me to do?  Get a fucking round table, asshole?  Look at this environment of abuse, you foster.  Did you just use the word foster?  Yes, how about a fun environment?  Like, hey, come on, guys.  Just chip in and talk a little bit.  Yeah, what, dude?  Talk it to the mic, you fucking asshole. 
[03:06:30]  Sorry, Bob.  Fuck you.  All right, you piece of shit.  It's just mean.  That's how we say we love you.  Maybe you're right.  You know what?  Maybe you're right, Jim.  Maybe I am a little, uh, maybe that's...  There's nothing little about you.  Oh, no.  This is why you can't treat Lewis like a human.  This is why he can't talk to anybody unless he makes eye contact like a fucking zoo chimp.  I was just about to fucking open up a little bit, and then you jump in with a fat joke. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Bobby.  I only have one trick.  Yeah, and that's looking like a backyard wrestling manager.  Sit down.  Sit down.  You look like you fucking...  Sit down.  You look like you set up the tables to be powerbomb for him.  I need a megaphone.  Or a GED.  What did you...  He called you fat, Bobby.  He called you fat.  Did you write for this? 
[03:07:30]  I've been up since six.  Liss couldn't be here.  He sent in some zings.  Zinger.  Here you go, Bill.  Kelly and her awful timing.  Kelly, stop me, really.  You have fucking shitty...  Zinger, man.  I'm on the edge.  I'm supposed to be out of it.  It's not the table.  Kelly comments like she's on live feed from Australia.  CNN.  Yeah, Bobby.  Yeah, it's stupid. 
[03:08:00]  Lewis is eyeing me off down there.  I don't like the way he's looking at me.  Yeah, because you fucking bailed on your set after a minute and a half.  What the fuck was that?  That's all she has.  I was talking to him.  I had more.  We started talking.  This shit started going on.  What?  Huh?  Listen.  You fucking understood me.  Ken, can you please interpret her?  He's room eating the fridge.  So, Bailey, you're one of the...  You and Jim, the podcast I did with you originally when I invited you over to my house, was one 
[03:08:30]  of the shows that actually got this, my show, a lot of recognition.  That's when people started listening because you and Jim were on the show.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, I mean...  Oh, you didn't know that?  I just don't...  That makes no sense.  Why not?  Because I just do...  I do porn.  Hey, we do really good, specific porn.  That's...  That's true.  That's true.  Have you ever watched your porn?  Me?  No. 
[03:09:00]  That's your real acting.  Yeah.  I don't know how to answer that question.  I've actually watched it with other transsexuals.  Or you're like, I know her.  That probably made them feel really good.  Lou, I said, I know her.  And they're like, who is it?  I'm like, wait.  They'll show her face in a second. 
[03:09:30]  Lou, have you ever watched it?  Yeah, I have watched it.  I haven't jerked off to it, though.  Really?  I couldn't bring myself to do it.  That's insane.  But now that I've met you and I have a full-fledged boner, I think I'm going to.  That's right.  And boner gone with Kelly talking.  Yeah, by the way, it really shows you how not hot Kelly is when Bailey J walks in the room.  See?  Oh, that was a good one.  I disagree.  I super want to bang Kelly pretty much.  Oh, yeah?  We established it.  Bailey J's also got cataracts.  Can you fuck her on the podcast?  We could do a fuck Kelly pizza party podcast. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, I would do that.  I would do that.  You would?  You'd fuck Kelly?  Yeah, let's make that happen.  Would you let her?  Would you fuck Bailey?  Well, I mean, she's fucking adorable.  She's got a good-sized dick on it.  I do.  And that's what I like.  And I like babies as well.  It's the fucking package.  I love it.  Literally.  So you'd do it?  You'd fuck Kelly?  Only in America.  Only in America.  This fucking Don King press conference we have going.  Only in America.  Can an Australian woman have sex with a man with titties? 
[03:10:30]  Only in America.  Only in America.  This is going to be a fun pizza party.  Scobo.  Scobo.  You down there?  Your mother's in the room.  Yeah, well, I know your mother.  Hang on.  Let me ask the question for you.  Right here.  And fucking, he's taking up all the space over me.  I can't even look at you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  After I start banging your mom, you're not going to have that time.  He doesn't bang Puerto Ricans, all right?  Louis.  His mom is here.  I know.  That was me flirting. 
[03:11:00]  Where's your mom?  Where's your mom?  She's over there.  Where is she?  I see her right there.  I'm making eye contact with her.  Louis, stop fucking, Miss Scobo, I'm sorry for this fucking animal.  Ma, ma, he's making fun.  Unless you're into him.  We can hook that up.  We can do a Bailey J. Kelly, you, and fucking Louis podcast.  Is this a swingers episode?  No, Scobo.  It's just Bailey J.  Don't you have a father?  Is it your father?  Yeah, he's right there behind her.  Oh, shit.  About to knock him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he'll beat the shit out of you.  Ah, shit. 
[03:11:30]  Mr. Scobo, I was just fucking around.  He's like, no disrespect to you, Robert.  I'm going to take that Puerto Rican out back.  I'm going to tell him with that fucking fat ass she got it from me.  I don't know who the other bird on the other end is squawking.  Scobo, in front of your mother and your father right now, can you be honest, would you fool around with Bailey J.?  Well, I don't know.  Bailey is.  There you go, Mom and Dad.  That's a yes.  No, no, no. 
[03:12:00]  When I first met Bailey J.  Under their Frank Sinatra picture.  Oh, yeah, probably, yeah.  When I first met you, you told me Bailey was hot.  I was like, oh, well, she's still a dude.  And when I first met her, I was like, wow, you're absolutely right.  That's true.  You stared at my tits when I blasted them.  The whole fucking time I stared at your tits.  Yeah, they were amazing.  Bailey, does it bother you, like, guys, like, we're all talking about banging you and shit like that.  Yeah.  But you're a friend of mine.  You're a friend of, you know, me and Jim.  It's work-related talk.  So it doesn't bother you that we're fucking joking around like this?  No, I'm deeply offended.  I don't give a fuck. 
[03:12:30]  I'm a dude with fucking tits.  Thanks.  You're blowing it.  I'm just saying.  Or a chick with a dick.  It depends on how you look at it.  That's why I fucking love you.  I really do.  I fucking...  I went up to their house in...  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  You can come murder me now.  Yeah, you live...  What?  I said, they can come murder me now.  I just said Poughkeepsie.  Nobody's driving up to shitty Poughkeepsie to murder anybody.  A shithole that is.  No, come up.  It's cheap.  But you live on like a little cul-de-sac.  There's apples.  There are apples.  Yeah, you have like apples.  You have like a Wiccan that lives next door to you. 
[03:13:00]  And you and...  And everybody knows who you are.  Yeah.  Well, kind of.  Yeah.  They know I have a...  I mean, I tell them like, I have a dick.  Wait a minute.  So that's your intro to The Neighbors?  Well, I don't tell them I do porn.  You come over with fucking brownies shaped like a dick?  I have one of these.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  Do you tell everybody that you meet?  I like to.  Otherwise, it gets awkward.  People ask me for tampons and shit.  I'm just like, I have a fucking dick.  You don't carry tampons?  Whatever. 
[03:13:30]  I should.  I should.  To cover.  But...  Well, you know, Louis is one of the...  Louis...  We think Louis is gay.  I mean, not even just, you know, like straight up has been with dudes.  That's not true.  No, that's really true, we think.  Louis is prison gay.  Louis goes into prison, he fucks dudes.  Outside all chicks, right, Lou?  Well, they're not dudes in prison.  Yeah.  They're your bunk mates.  But Louis, the first thing I did when I... 
[03:14:00]  This is how I know Louis is just fucking likes guys.  The first thing I did when I said we're doing this podcast, he goes, dude, I want to challenge  you to a blowjob competition.  Straight up, he said that shit.  No joke.  And I'm like, I go, what the fuck is that?  I've never heard of that.  Like, is that on some special channel on Vios?  And he goes, I'm going to suck a dick.  I got a dildo.  He carries...  He has his own dildo.  He carries it around like a rabbit's foot. 
[03:14:30]  Show him.  Cocktober.  Cocktober.  Do you for real have a dildo?  I thought I smelled dildo.  You smell dildo?  A dildo has a smell.  Yeah.  Like a dildo.  Look at that.  That's not a dildo.  What if she pulled it out?  That's a dildo.  They should be the size of an actual dick.  That's so disappointing.  Look, I'm working my way up.  You know how like emo guys stretch out their earlobes?  Okay, okay, okay.  This is like... 
[03:15:00]  This is a 10-gauge.  That's a great seat holder if you're out somewhere.  Oh, shit.  What is that?  Well, we...  More dildo?  I don't know what this one...  I tried to get one that looks like mine.  That one's way better.  This one's better?  It's called the Basic 7.  How boring.  That's my...  I'm a Basic 7.  Well, I'll be weeping Basic 7 in the shower.  I'm a Basic 7. 
[03:15:30]  If I had a Basic 7, I'd be on the Bill Burr podcast right now.  Bobby Kelly.  We got it, stupid.  You're on my show now, you fucking idiot.  Robert Kelly's You Know What Dude podcast.  That's not the one.  Norton just instinctually went to grab this out of my hand.  At least I don't pretend I don't know what a blowjob contest is.  Dude, let's suck each other's dicks.  How would that work?  Well, at least my acting's better than yours. 
[03:16:00]  I don't have to act.  Go ahead and suck it.  What's a blowjob competition?  This is...  Is that the size of your dick?  Um, no.  Is your dick...  It's like the same texture.  Is your...  Is your dick bigger than that or smaller than that?  No, it's close.  It's close.  What?  Is it smaller, close, or bigger, close?  Jim?  No, I'm looking at it.  It's probably about...  It's close.  Hold it.  Maybe a little smaller, but it's a little thicker here. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  Are we passing it down?  Is that what we're doing?  Well, okay.  It's the talking stick.  That's how you get to talk on this podcast.  Can I see the dildo for a second?  This is how...  Look, can you hold this for a second?  From this Pacquiao Mayweather.  Yeah.  I have the power!  Can I touch it?  You really?  That's a fucking good size.  Yeah, that's a heavy dick.  Not for a dildo.  Let me feel it.  There we go.  There's like real dick standards and dildo standards. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  So, wait, what does that mean?  Real dick standards and dildo standards?  Because if you own a seven-inch dick on your body, that is good.  But if you're going to buy a dick, why not buy a ten-inch dick?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You see what I'm saying?  No, I don't.  It's like getting fake tits.  It's like...  Come on.  It's like getting fake tits and getting a beacup.  That's so much fun.  You know what I mean?  Okay, so if you're going to buy...  And ladies, is this real?  If you're going to buy a dildo, you're going to go get a fucking massive cock.  Get an eight-inch dick. 
[03:17:30]  Yes, ladies, love it.  All right, wait a minute.  Scopo, go get the microphone.  Get this fuck up here.  I thought you were going to say, Scopo, go get your mom.  I was like, whoa.  Dude, not cool.  That hurts inside.  That hurts inside, honestly.  Go ask that girl right there.  You said...  Yeah, you.  You said no.  Which one?  Which one?  What's your name?  Scopo.  The one you're blocking right now.  Dude, I love Scopo's shitty man in Street Job now.  Scopo, stand up and right here.  So, if you're going to get a dildo, if you're...  Hi, what's your name, sweetie? 
[03:18:00]  Tatiana.  Can you turn the mics up, please?  What's your name, sweetie?  Tatiana.  Tatiana?  That's a great name.  What is that, Jewish?  Is that Arabic?  What is that?  Russian?  It's Russian.  I know it's Russian.  Russian?  Russian Jew, right?  I'm not Russian.  Listen, if you're going to buy a dildo, you're going to go smaller or bigger?  Just average is okay.  What's average to you, though?  You're from Russia. 
[03:18:30]  What's average?  Do it with your hands.  Do it with your hands.  I'm so glad you're in for Dan, not for me.  Good for you, Lou.  You're growing up.  Tell me, if your act was average, you'd be in any club in New York City.  See?  See what he does?  Yeah, he takes it too fucking far all the time.  Don't feed him.  What is average?  Like seven?  Seven is average.  That is not average.  It's cold, Russian winter.  We have 12-inch penis. 
[03:19:00]  Put in our pussy.  We don't know when we get more gruel.  So we have to suck semen from big penis.  Wait a minute.  Seven is fucking average, dude?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  By applause, women only.  Some Ivan Drago, dude.  I don't want you two fucking standing up.  Is seven average for a penis?  Scopo, your mom's applauding.  I didn't realize we were doing Size Queens Live. 
[03:19:30]  Listen.  What's your big dick loving horse?  How's corporate for that, Bob?  This guy's staring at me like he's going to fucking murder me.  Are you all right with all this dick talk?  All right.  He's the nicest step down.  Bob, they want to talk back here, too.  Bob, these two are talking.  They say seven, too.  Tell those sluts no.  All right.  I'm kidding. 
[03:20:00]  I'm kidding.  The one in the middle, the brunette, the Charlie's Angel right there.  What's your name, sweetie?  Christina.  Christina.  Now, is seven a good size for you?  I think that's the perfect size.  What about four and a half, five?  What about five some days?  Some days.  If you love the person.  Oh, Jesus.  Boom.  Yay.  Boom.  Dismissed.  You know, Jim, you don't like that?  You don't like that?  Why?  If you love the person, you just leave them home and then go cheat on them. 
[03:20:30]  Whoa, that's not guy code.  Whoa, bro.  Keep that up.  I'll take you to guy court.  It's on 11 tonight.  MTV2.  Yuck.  What about the blonde?  You know, you like it big, don't you?  Whoa.  Hey.  She came out.  That's the one who came out to me outside of the show and asked for a picture with me.  Oh, yeah.  Well, she's probably regretting that right now.  Disappointed. 
[03:21:00]  What's your name, sweetie?  Nicola.  Yeah, it is.  What?  Yeah, it is.  Nicola.  Oh, it's your birthday.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Oh, I love Jersey girls.  There's nothing better than a Jersey girl to me.  You guys are the perfect mix of sexy, dirty.  You guys have good self-esteem, but yet you kind of fucked up a little bit.  You know what I mean?  I love you girls.  The others, you're not from Jersey, are you?  I am from Siberia.  Siberia. 
[03:21:30]  I hunt the lion for them.  I am from work camp near St. Petersburg.  What?  St. Petersburg.  How the fuck do you know that?  You're not Russian?  I got one joke.  Where are you?  No, the blonde in the back fucking, what's your name again?  Nicola.  Nicola.  What is your perfect penis size?  I would have to, because my girl, for seven, I would go.  So just seven, I mean seven is around, that's perfect.  That voice says I date black dudes.  She's like, I got to go with my girl? 
[03:22:00]  I think like a nice chocolate 12.  Does anybody like a five?  Anybody?  Don't not applaud, you do.  Do you like that?  You got a small dick, dude.  Uh-huh.  She went like this.  She just figured out what she revealed.  No, but is a five good for you?  Are you all right with a five?  Are you good with a five? 
[03:22:30]  So five is good.  The seven's too much, right?  Seven's just ridiculous.  He hurts me sometimes.  He hurts you?  Yeah, I was going to say, because he's so tall, you're a big dude, so you would have a big cock because you're tall.  No, not with a dick, he smacks her in the face.  Yeah.  For laughing at a five good cock.  That's why she was like in her sometimes, too fucking big, right?  Why is Kelly's mic louder than everybody else's?  Because I know how to eat the mic properly.  Bobby, I've never heard.  You know how to eat.  What's?  Bobby, I've never heard anybody, you're the first person I've heard, down sell a dick. 
[03:23:00]  Anybody three?  Three?  Two.  I just don't buy, first of all, seven is too much.  Too much.  This is a seven.  You're greedy.  That's going to hurt something in the back.  That's big, that's big.  That's going to fucking hit something.  How was that?  How did you know that shit?  First of all...  You're biting that dick like what?  Come up here and put this in your vagina.  I want to see something.  No, seriously. 
[03:23:30]  Just one second.  I just want to see one thing.  Just put it past that.  I love it if she was a real animal and just did it.  Put her foot up on the table.  She made you do like a fucking sword in the stone.  She's like, pull it out.  Pull that shit out if you're the real king.  Like fucking king author.  Grip it and rip it.  Grip it and rip it.  So this would fit in your vagina nicely.  Yes.  Yes, this is good.  That is ridiculous.  I feel like that's like a novelty dick that's so big. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, listen.  First of all, so Lewis, is there anybody in here that...  Do you want to have a competition with Bailey?  Who can suck dick better?  You said you could suck dick better than her.  No, I said I'd like to challenge myself.  There's no challenge for you sucking dick.  I don't know if I can suck dick better than a porn star.  I assume you can.  You have dick sucking lips.  There we go.  Flattery will get you everywhere.  All right, so let's do this.  Lewis, you go first.  Take your dick. 
[03:24:30]  All right, you're going to go down on it right there?  What is it, have a suction cup?  Yeah, there's a suction cup on both of them, bro.  So you can back into it.  Yeah, so you can swaddle it on the ground.  So you can smack it on the wall and put your asshole into it.  Okay.  You knew that way too quickly, Lou.  Seriously, what are you doing?  I just imagine Lou wiggling his butt.  So you can smack it on your bathroom door,  get a little Vaseline in your asshole,  and back up slowly into it.  Hey, B, don't come in for about ten minutes. 
[03:25:00]  Or I want you to come in and then go out  and then come in and then go out  and then come in and then go out.  Have you ever put one of these in your ass, Lewis?  Honest to God.  Of course.  Wait, what was the question?  You've stuck in one of these in your butt?  I've never stuffed it in my ass.  Listen, have you ever put it near your ass?  Not this one.  Honest to God.  I really, I'll, look it. 
[03:25:30]  No, dude, I got a hemorrhoid from lifting weights  a long time ago,  and I'm afraid that it's going to come back.  That's a great opening line on Match.com.  Yeah.  So I'm looking for someone  who enjoys long walks  and laying on our stomachs.  Oh, shit.  By the way,  doesn't this guy look like  a good-looking Joe DeRosa?  Look at this guy.  He really does.  Side note.  Way to bring the podcast down, Lewis.  Jesus Christ.  It's a visual.  Yeah, you want to fucking make  any more observations, Seinfeld? 
[03:26:00]  Shut up and stick to the dick-sucking jokes.  What's the deal with Dildos  being so suckable?  This guy has a five o'clock shadow  like Joe DeRosa.  Listen, here's the deal.  You're going to do  a dick-sucking competition.  You're going to go first.  You have two minutes.  What are we judging?  Two minutes.  That's pretty long time.  That's a little gay.  That's a little gay.  I was going to say three. 
[03:26:30]  And I thought that was too silly.  I want to watch it for four minutes.  Slowly.  Take a time.  Some nice over-the-jean touching.  It's two minutes too long, Jim.  Yeah, it's too long by a minute and 50 seconds.  First, Bailey, is there any, like, all right, is there any techniques? 
[03:27:00]  No, no.  There's no techniques for a great blowjob.  The only people who talk about techniques...  I'm talking to the mic, though.  The only people that talk about techniques are chicks.  I've never heard a gay guy talk about techniques  because they're too busy sucking dick.  If you want to suck dick, just suck a dick.  You don't have to take a fucking class.  There's nothing.  If you like sucking dick, it'll feel good for the guy.  I think that's the only rule for sucking dick.  Yeah.  Just got to be into it.  To tell women, and you slutty's back at that table.  If you suck a dick like you love sucking dick... 
[03:27:30]  Just love sucking, yeah.  ...then you're going to give a great head.  Yeah.  So you're saying suck dick from the heart.  Yeah.  Yes.  Gotcha.  Suck dick like a gay guy.  I always say that.  Suck dick like a gay guy.  I don't like to make...  Dance like no one's watching.  Love like you've never been hurt.  Suck dick like a gay guy.  Someone put that on a throw pillow.  That's the name of your next album.  There it is. 
[03:28:00]  I think...  No.  I think gay guys, the way gay guys suck dick,  because I've seen gay porn, it's not...  It doesn't look as good.  It's fucking...  It's so not sexy.  They do it just like a machine.  Yeah, it's like, come on, get back to the kissing.  I'm saying...  Look, I'm saying this, Jim,  that when a gay guy sucks a dick, 
[03:28:30]  Lewis, just suck the dick.  Just suck a dick like the gay guy.  Oh, wait, are we starting the competition?  Not yet, but I just want to show him something.  Because you know...  No, I'm not going to just fucking blow my load.  Just for an example.  Yeah, that's his free bird.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I mean, seriously.  Have you seen gay porn?  Why?  I'm going to ask you again.  That guy was just fighting for her freedom, 
[03:29:00]  probably six months ago.  Look at that haircut.  Have you ever seen gay porn?  Not to watch it, but jerk off.  How have you not seen gay porn?  Every person has seen gay porn.  Everybody has seen gay porn.  You've seen gay porn, right?  What the fuck?  That's such liars.  Big boy, you've seen gay porn.  Yeah.  You have?  Well, he's got a five-inch dick, so...  Yeah.  He's a bear.  That's what we...  So, now, when you see a gay guy blow another guy,  it's not...  It's just sucking the dick.  I agree with that.  Like, in its purest form,  where it's like, there's no... 
[03:29:30]  Like a girl...  It's theater.  Ooh, you like that?  And you're like,  that's a little sexy,  a little more feminine.  Gay guys are...  And even the noise  just sounds like a machine.  You know what I mean?  You don't like some guy with a beard  and his fucking cap  turned around backwards?  No, I think that women...  I think when you enjoy sucking a dick 
[03:30:00]  and you really...  Look, I think gay guys enjoy sucking dick,  by the way.  That's kind of what I mean.  I think they're more into it.  I don't think so.  It might not look as good,  but I've had a head from girls,  believe it or not.  Really?  Yeah, and it was not great.  I mean, well, this girl in particular,  because she's very like...  I'm just like,  who are you doing this for?  So it's just too many bells and whistles?  Yeah, just put it in your throat.  So you don't like the camera and the nav?  You just want a car to go?  I want to fuck her throat. 
[03:30:30]  I don't want her to put on a performance  and feel like she needs to act  like fucking Beyonce or something.  I like showmanship.  Just suck a dick.  I like showmanship, too.  I like a dance.  I think it's so gay.  I like a little spit.  I like a little lie.  I like a little lie.  Oh, I...  You know?  Well, but, Billy, you're in porn, though.  Isn't a part of it showmanship?  Isn't a part of it smoking mirrors?  In porn, yeah, but that's not like...  Well, we're about to have a competition  for the audience, though.  We're about to have a competition  for the audience,  so they can't feel it.  We almost have to give them a show. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, I mean, I'll do that, I guess.  But I just mean in general  when I'm just a person...  But your heart is not into it.  I'd rather just lay on the side of the bed  and have someone just, like,  bang my throat.  Fine.  She wasn't asking,  you fucking weirdo.  I was telling you.  Look, Jim, when you get head...  I have mornings like that, too.  You like a nice...  Some mornings you just want to lay  on my side  and just have someone  bang my throat.  You're like a Summer's Ears commercial.  Sorry.  Yeah.  You like a nice wet one.  Yeah.  You like spitting. 
[03:31:30]  Well, who likes a dry blowjob?  Yeah, no one likes a dry blowjob.  Well, I bet the...  It's not easy to feel  like a statue's fist.  That's not what I'm saying,  you fucking assholes.  I mean, there's a blowjob,  but then there's a really wet one  where they're spitting on it,  gagging on it,  and the saliva's coming  from the top of the thing.  Sorry, Scopo's mom.  I didn't know you were coming.  You know who gives great head  in Ari Vox?  Who's that?  She's a porn girl.  She kind of retired,  then she got back into it,  but she gives blowjobs I like.  Like, really gagging, 
[03:32:00]  sloppy, wet,  obscene blowjobs.  Yeah, like where it's like  there's just,  she's puking on your dick.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's not puke,  it's just saliva.  It's like stringy,  yeah, I get it.  Yeah, it's a real,  it's an alive thing.  If you push the dick down  deep enough into the throat,  the natural saliva that comes up  is a really gooey...  Yeah.  Slagging.  I mean, what's supposed to be?  What the fuck are you, Kelly?  Yeah.  What the fuck happened to you?  She stepped in with some  Bill Nye science dick sucking. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  You hit the fucking gland  in the back.  That was called  the saliva pollock?  Yeah.  That's the saliva you want  because when you use  the front saliva,  when you spit in it,  it gets too dry too quickly,  so you've got to get it  to the back to make it  like that sloppy one.  Kelly talks about sucking dick  like she's fixing an engine.  She's like,  yeah, what you want to do  is get it nice.  You know,  you want the pistons to fire.  But, you know,  make them come.  Get their throat saliva. 
[03:33:00]  Have you ever thrown up  on a dick?  No.  Not you.  No.  I haven't.  Ah, shit.  Bailey.  No, I haven't.  Have you ever gagged?  What's the biggest dick  you've ever had?  Well, surprisingly,  not like massive dicks,  but like,  I don't know,  like ten.  Ten? 
[03:33:30]  That's massive.  That's pretty good.  That's massive.  Well, no, I mean,  I just meant like not,  okay, that's pretty good.  Check in with that table.  Show me ten.  Yes.  Ten's too big.  No, it wasn't in my ass.  I just blew the person.  Right, you just sucked it.  Yeah, no.  Was it a two-hander?  Was it like one,  two, three, four,  you win?  That was two hands  and I'm a tranny,  so it's a big deal.  Did you have to dislocate  your jaw like an anaconda?  No, I'm good with the throat.  I'm good with the throat,  but I've only let one person  bang my ass 
[03:34:00]  because I feel like  once your asshole's  stretched out,  you're just done.  And that's your husband?  Yeah, isn't that funny?  Where's Matt?  Is Matt you here?  Matthew, are you here?  Matt, can I smell your dick?  Why don't you just smell hers?  Yeah, I'll smell the same.  Oh, Lou.  Go around yourself.  Kelly, what's the biggest dick  you've ever had?  Like, I reckon it was like 10  and it was...  You reckon?  She says reckon,  which means...  It was huge.  It was reckon your pussy.  When he took it out,  I could see like its heart  beating in front of me.  It was so fucking big  and thick 
[03:34:30]  and I was like,  I don't know how I'm going to do this,  but I did it like a champ.  It was a stormy night.  I saw its outline,  the shadow of the lightning  and I reckon it was about  10 and a half inches.  A hard dick coming for me.  Her fucking unforgiving story  about having a big dick.  It scared the shit out of me.  I didn't know I was going to get it in.  Bobby.  What?  I got Matt over here.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah, where is he? 
[03:35:00]  Right here.  Matt.  Can you bring him in a light,  you fucking idiot?  Yeah, he's sitting back here.  It's like a seance.  Well, bring him up.  Matt, are you here?  Where is Matt?  Speak to us, Matt.  There's Matt.  Matt Bailey's husband  who is the star of her,  one of the stars of the podcast,  the Bailey J Show.  Matt, how are you, buddy?  I'm good.  How are you?  And you look at Matt  and he's a little dude.  Hi, Matt.  You're a little guy.  Hi, buddy.  How's it going, baby?  Everybody say hi to Matt, please.  I don't like how much love is happening.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  But Matt, you got a big piece.  Thank you.  Really?  How big is your piece?  It's a seven-inch piece.  Seven inches.  Check it out of the table.  You're more than welcome.  So this is your dick right here?  Yeah, pretty much.  Really?  That's what I was thinking.  I think it looks like it's...  His is browner, but yeah.  Brown?  Why is your dick brown, dude?  Don't act like you haven't seen his dick at once.  Did you clean it?  Do you know where it's been?  I'm half Italian.  I'm Sicilian.  He's Sicilian. 
[03:36:00]  So your dick is brown.  He's got purple nipples and a brown dick, yeah.  I'm acting like I don't know, like I haven't seen it nine times in your fucking movies.  Your dick's brown.  Ah.  Well, Matt, this podcast should be called Bob asks his friends how big their penises are.  Casually.  Bob and dicks.  Is it going to bother you if everybody wants to bang your wife?  No.  Make love.  Make love.  No, I don't care.  It's cool.  I get it.  I love you.  That's why you're such a great couple.  I love you too, Bob.  Well, I think me and Matt are going to fuck. 
[03:36:30]  I think y'all are going to fuck.  What'd you say?  You've mentioned that you want to fuck my husband.  Not like literally.  Jokingly.  But I know jokingly.  But you don't say it in front of a fucking room full of people.  I'm just saying.  Seriously.  My wife is going to hear this.  I'm sorry about your wife's life.  Your wife knows, Bob.  She knows.  She knows.  You've said it in front of her jokingly.  Yeah, jokingly.  I don't know.  You think I want to fuck a dude?  Sure.  Because you like him.  He's a good guy.  Not him.  I'm not fucking Matt.  Oh, all right.  Sorry.  Would you beg me in theory? 
[03:37:00]  What does that mean?  She made her asshole theory.  In theory, would you fuck my ass?  I would find it hard not to fuck you.  Okay.  That's a yes.  No, it's not a yes.  I would find it hard not to fuck her.  I find it hard not to take the pizza off a buffet.  But sometimes I don't take it.  That's a lie.  That's true.  But you have to...  It's just a lie.  There's no way out on this fucking show.  You're going to get assaulted. 
[03:37:30]  Listen.  That is not a lie.  No sugar.  No grains for three weeks.  Who the fuck are you laughing at?  Because grains are not your problem, you fat fuck.  I like the fact that he's proud of himself.  No grains.  He's just holding a fake dick.  You know what, dude?  I'm taking care of me today.  Yeah, I'd suck your dick.  I'd suck your husband's dick.  If I'm being good to me, no sugar. 
[03:38:00]  You make a point.  You make a point, Norton.  All right.  Well, put this over here.  Why are you putting it in front of me?  All right, so...  What?  Why are you putting it in front of me?  Oh, there...  Yeah, Kelly goes for it.  We're going to do this competition right now.  We're going to see who sucks a dick better.  Okay.  My...  Would you just say yes?  Is that what you're...  Finally, the moment you've been waiting for.  I want to take bets right now. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, who?  That was Justin Silver.  He's the man.  Who thinks...  Justin Silver is a very famous...  Not famous, but...  Gay guy.  He's a comedian.  Sensual man.  He's a comedian.  The dogs in the city.  Do you guys know that show?  Yeah.  Drop it up for dogs.  It's called The Real Housewives.  It's called The Real Housewives of New York.  What's that?  Can I put real money on it?  I say right now...  You need odds.  I think that...  I think Lewis is going to suck a better dick.  Yeah, I do.  I do a lot of bookmaking for...  Well, I think I'm definitely an underdog on this.  What's that?  I'm an underdog in this competition. 
[03:39:00]  Absolutely.  Definitely.  On paper, Bailey should have me all day long.  I will.  I think...  I think...  And we're going to vote by applause.  Okay?  Lewis, I want you to get your cock ready.  It's been ready.  I want you to stand up in the front here.  We're standing up.  It's going to be better than a set.  I wouldn't suck a cock standing up.  What do you want to do?  Get on your knees?  What do you want to do?  Do it on a table?  How do you do it in your fantasy, Lewis?  How are you going to...  I'm sorry. 
[03:39:30]  How do you suck a dick, Lewis?  I'm not standing up, Robert Kelly.  He's not a fucking 14-foot-tall guy.  How would I stand up?  How about you lay over the back?  You hang your back, and you hang your head back over.  You'll fuck your mouth with it like that.  Bobby, they want real money on this over here.  Who's that?  Can I put real money on it?  Who's that?  Justin Silver, everybody.  Applaud it.  Can I put real money on it?  I have money from CBS.  Shut up, Lewis.  I have CBS money.  It's almost gone.  Can I put...  How much do you want to put on it? 
[03:40:00]  Who are you betting with?  You're betting whether your friend sucks a better dick than another friend.  He has inside information.  I believe in my friend, Bobby.  So you'll bet...  How much do you want to bet?  I'll put 20 bucks on Lewis.  20 bucks?  20 on Lewis?  And Lewis sucks a better dick than Bailey.  Two to one odds.  You're betting 20, winning 60.  All right.  You make the odds?  I mean, I'm bookmaking this dick-sucking competition.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want 20 on Lewis.  But what does Vegas say?  This is like the kumite.  Yeah.  Rob Sprantz is up there.  Blood-spotted dick.  Rob Sprantz, one of the founders of...  He is the founder of Riotcast Network. 
[03:40:30]  Hey!  Rob, who do you think is going to suck a better dick?  Lewis, because he's a closet fag.  Lewis, because he's a closet fag.  He's not closet at all.  It's not closet when you do it on a podcast in front of an audience.  It's not closet when I've seen him suck a dildo like 17 times.  I don't know.  Every single story that he tells is like,  Oh, now we're sucking a dick.  Or I saw this man and we put your door off together.  That was Justin Silver from CBS's Don't Get the City. 
[03:41:00]  I'm not even lying about that.  I got money on Lewis, although I think Bobby could do it gentle, too.  I'm not in the competition.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What are you thinking about alone at night?  Partnership, brother.  Did you just say I could suck a dick gentle?  Yeah.  If I'm sucking a dick, I'm not being gentle.  Dick, that was a double dare.  You know what?  New element.  Dan Soder has to hang the dicks out of his pants.  No.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I'll hang it out of my pants.  You ready?  Let's do this. 
[03:41:30]  You guys ready to see this?  Oh, God.  Fighting out of the red corner.  Oh, my dick.  All right.  Put money on Bailey, Lewis.  Yeah, I'm going to put money on Bailey.  I'm putting money on Lewis.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, you're going to pay Bailey.  What are we voting for?  We're voting for, like, believability?  You guys aren't going to get a shot of this.  Where's that one?  Where's this one?  This is Lewis's dick.  That's his cocktober.  That was the one he has.  No, that's the one he has.  But is this, like, are we voting on theater? 
[03:42:00]  Like, what looks more beautiful?  I can't see, Bob.  Hold on.  Or what looks more believable?  You're right in front.  Thank you.  I've got to get up and watch this.  Pat backwards.  That is the worst dildo I've ever seen in my life.  Just, like, the worst.  Sucking in your blue corner.  Hailing from Rockville.  Rockland County.  You're beautiful.  Nikolai Volkov over there.  You've got a beautiful cock. 
[03:42:30]  Wait, you have a son, Lewis.  Remember that.  Do it for your son.  You're going to get on your knees, Lewis?  Lewis, you ready?  The whole crowd will judge it by applause.  Suck that dick.  Lewis, do you want me to pump you up?  Suck that dick.  No, don't do that, dude.  Don't make that up.  Listen to me.  Just do it for baby James.  Do it for baby James.  Do it for baby James.  Hailing from Rockville, Center, New York.  Weighing in at 246 pounds of sloppy dick sucking meat.  He is the real ass dude, Lewis Goldman. 
[03:43:00]  You know, we're both with the same management, and they're here tonight.  They're going, what the fuck are we doing?  I smell a series.  James Lewis and I suck.  This is definitely the gayest thing I've ever done.  Right.  Lewis, do you need a pep talk?  I like Jim looked at him.  This is not even in my top ten. 
[03:43:30]  Do you want balls out or in?  Do you want balls out or in?  I like balls out.  Me too.  All right, here we go.  Ready?  All right, Lee.  Bring for you, Matt.  Bring for you, Matt.  Wait, 60 seconds of dick sucking action.  60 seconds?  That's fucking awkward.  Is that wrong?  60 seconds when it's hanging out of my pants is a little weird.  Yeah.  I know.  It's what I mean.  Mom, how you feeling?  So what are we doing?  30 seconds?  She's going to need therapy now, Bob. 
[03:44:00]  She's really in therapy.  30 seconds.  Are you timing?  All right, I got him.  All right, here we go.  Ready?  Are you guys ready?  Spin it, Lou, Lou, Lou it up.  Come on, like a real man.  Let's do it.  Come on.  All right.  Go properly.  What are you doing?  It's safe for.  Lewis has sensitive knees.  He's making this more and more like a real blowjob.  He's like, hold on real quick.  Can we go to the Olive Garden?  You nasty girl.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  He just told me, I need one of your legs up. 
[03:44:30]  Ew.  This is gross.  Filthy.  I'm a training porn star and this is fucked up.  Clever girl.  He just, he's, you've done this before.  Yeah, what are you doing?  He's going to suck his dick like he books the cellar.  You're actually grossing Jim Norton out.  Are you ready?  All right.  Are we going to do a countdown?  All right. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, you want to give me a nice end of Rocky 3?  No, you want me to do a nice end of Rocky 3?  We have a timer.  We have a timer.  Thank God you, thank God you're pretty dead.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  I'm so happy I'm in every photo of this dead on.  Right in the middle.  This will never come back to haunt me.  You think the owner, the owner of the Village Underground is like, what the fuck is this?  That's all the photos that are going to be in Time Out Magazine.  Luis Gomez blowing me with his fucking logo in the fucking head. 
[03:45:30]  Robert Kelly gets his dick blown by some guy.  Luis J. Gomez.  All right, you want the leg up still?  How about my fucking, I got a fucking, I got a bad knee, dude.  I got a bad knee, dude.  All right, ready?  Oh, God.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Go.  Let's go, go.  Oh, he spit on it.  I can't watch. 
[03:46:00]  I can't watch.  He sucked a dick.  I can't watch.  He sucked a dick before. 
[03:46:30]  He's not.  Yeah, he went and then pushed it down.  And it was, he sucked an uncircumcised dick because he spit and then pushed to get the  thing over the helmet.  You sluts know, right? 
[03:47:00]  The way he closed his eyes longingly made it go.  He cradled the balls.  He cradled the balls.  He stubbed his ass.  He stuck his hand through my ass and pulled me in.  Yeah.  I haven't had that done in fucking 20 years.  That's a tough performance to beat, Bailey.  I want you to teach my wife that.  Oh, God.  You gave me half a chubby, Louie.  That was great.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Bailey?  Yeah?  All right.  Okay.  Yeah?  Okay. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah?  Do I sound excited?  I would just fucking, I would just quit.  I quit.  I could, could I forfeit so then you just sucked your dick for no reason?  Do you know how great that is if you forfeit?  Oh, please forfeit, Bailey J.  I think I might forfeit.  Hey, congratulations.  All right, Lewis, you won.  Lewis won.  I can't compete with that.  You made a porn star quit.  You're good.  You just intimidated Bailey J. out of not doing it. 
[03:48:00]  No, I can't compete with that dick sucking.  All right.  There you go, Lou.  Was that the fucking weirdest thing for you?  Let me ask you a question.  Listen, dude.  I was fucking uncomfortable.  I'm going to ask you this question.  I want you to be honest.  I know your girl's with you.  Please be honest.  Did you go, oh, that was fucking kind of cool.  Like, that was kind of hot.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Fuck them.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Was it kind of like, oh, he's sucking a good dick?  Like that, it was a, he sucked it good.  Yo, can my boy handle a dick or what? 
[03:48:30]  Like, what?  That's beautiful.  I can't believe how good he sucked it.  That fucking push-in.  Scopa's mom, what do you say with Louis?  Thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  She gave him a thumbs up.  Wow.  Wow.  Well, anyways.  I feel like I was just raped.  What?  I feel like I was just raped.  I just want to let you know, do you know how many photos there are?  I'm so happy.  Of you sucking my dick while I'm giggling?  That's my fucking Christmas card for the next fucking 10 years. 
[03:49:00]  You fucking asshole.  That's a season screen?  It was like fucking TMZ out here.  And you had your eyes closed, you fucking homo.  Oh my God.  He turned his hat around, too, to get better grip.  Just give me that moment when you go home later and you're like, ah, it was a lot of people.  Those are video cameras.  This is on video.  Look.  We're recording it. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, you have a son.  At least I get to tell my son I was the one getting the blowjob.  Your average looking son.  Whoa.  Come on.  Whoa.  I really hope the next guy Louis starts shit with on the street sees that video.  He's like, I'm not afraid of you.  You suck Bobby Kelly's dick.  That actually, in the photo, is going to look really like, that looks like my dick.  That's going to look like you really suck a dick.  It looked like it from here. 
[03:50:00]  No, yeah.  Did it really?  Yes.  Yes.  Did it look real?  You're holding your ass and sucking it with commitment.  I don't like that Bailey just fucking forfeited and I had to suck your dick for no reason.  Clever girl.  That was my plan ever since I heard about it.  That was my plan.  Really?  Yeah, I was going to let this happen.  You're mad?  You're what?  You're mad that she won't fake suck a dick?  Yeah.  Why?  She sucks dick for a living.  That's true.  I'm not working overtime.  Yeah.  She's not.  You're just union?  Yeah.  You're like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a fake sucking dick. 
[03:50:30]  That's upsetting though.  It was supposed to be a competition.  You won.  Yeah, you won.  I got lost though.  Listen, man.  You did a good job.  You sucked the dick.  And let me tell you something.  Sure did.  I'm not even chitting around.  Yeah.  I fucking.  When you were sucking my dick, dude, I was proud of you.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  Come on, Bobby.  Are you fucking with me?  What do you mean, man?  I'm not fucking with you.  I was proud of you, man.  Because you know what?  You fucking said you were going to do something and you did it.  And most of your life you didn't do that.  And now you're at a part of your life where you're stepping up to the plate and you said 
[03:51:00]  you're going to suck a dick.  And you sucked the dick in front of everybody.  And you know what?  I think you sucked.  The hot Russians saw it.  You sucked a good dick, man.

So instead of spending hours in the kitchen making yours,  go to mamamancini's.com, find a supermarket near you, and pick up some Mama Mancini's. 
[03:59:30]  Available at your local supermarkets.  Florex DS Probiotic.  Why do you shake it and take it?  So happy the kids are back in school.  Yeah, but now comes all the colds, coughing, and sneezing.  Not for us.  Really?  Uh-huh.  My kids and I take Florex DS ready-to-drink probiotic.  A probiotic?  Yep.  Turns out 70% of your immune system is contained in your gut.  Oh, so healthy gut.  Healthy you.  And you only need to take it once a week.  Wow, Florex DS?  Where can I get some?  Your nearest Walgreens.  Let me choose what's best for you. </pre>
