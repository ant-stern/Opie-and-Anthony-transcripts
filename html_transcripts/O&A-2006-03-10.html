<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heavily profane and racially charged discussion of *American Idol*, specifically the elimination of Gideon and the survival of "Chicken Little" Kevin.  Opie and Anthony, along with Patrice O'Neal (who'd wagered money on the outcome), debated the reasons for Gideon's elimination, offering explanations ranging from his perceived "weirdness" and "gayness" to racial bias in the voting.  Technical difficulties with Opie's microphone plagued the early part of this segment.  The hosts extensively analyzed voting demographics and viewer motivations, continuing their discussion with further profane commentary after a recap of their predictions.

Burt Young, known for his role as Paulie in the *Rocky* films, then joined the show. The conversation shifted to the upcoming *Rocky Balboa* film, his character, the aging of the franchise, and anecdotes from his career, punctuated by more offensive language and sexually suggestive remarks. The discussion also touched upon the portrayal of Italian-Americans in film and television, referencing *The Sopranos*.  A separate segment featured Young promoting his art show's US debut, interspersed with banter from the hosts, listener calls (including one about a brothel's proximity to the gallery), and further details about *Rocky Balboa*.

The show later tackled a 13-year-old girl's faked kidnapping, focusing on media coverage and alleged racial biases in reporting missing persons cases.  This sparked another contentious and highly offensive debate between the hosts and Patrice O'Neal about racial disparities, the media's portrayal of crime, and the disproportionate attention given to missing white children compared to missing Black children.  The discussion included references to the Tawana Brawley and JonBenét Ramsey cases, and concluded with a discussion of the FX show *Black White*. Clips from the show were played.

Earlier in the broadcast, a discussion about perceived racial bias in a sneaker store transitioned into a broader conversation about racism, the hosts’ experiences with racial slurs and stereotypes, and their own use of offensive language. This evolved into a discussion of racial stereotypes, especially regarding driving habits.  The conversation then shifted to the video game "Contents Under Pressure," leading to a debate on the impact of violent video games on children. The hosts shared anecdotes about their own video game experiences, particularly strategy games like "Age of Empires 3" and EverQuest, including discussions about online communities, the sale of in-game items on eBay, and the significant time and monetary investments involved.  Greg Giraldo was a guest during this segment.

A later segment focused on online virtual worlds and their addictive nature, featuring in-depth discussions about online gaming addiction, its consequences (such as relationship breakdowns), and the blurring lines between virtual and real-life relationships.  Listeners called in to share their own experiences.  The hosts and guests, including Greg Giraldo and Patrice O'Neal, discussed the commercialization of online gaming, the rise of MySpace and its impact on the comedy scene, and Patrice O'Neal's attempts to meet women online. This segment also included a humorous bit about unrealistic virtual reality expectations and a discussion about managing multiple relationships using the analogy of juggling two very different girlfriends after the hosts received new XM Satellite Radio Helix devices. The segment concluded with a discussion about fear-mongering in news teases and the theft of a prank from their show by a Vegas radio station, promising to play audio of this theft the following Monday.  Greg Giraldo was again identified as a studio guest.

The show opened with a riddle about a homeowner's basement filled with accidentally delivered heating oil and continued with the hosts mocking news teases. They humorously read a fictional 1982 commercial for an appetite suppressant called "AIDS". The broadcast concluded with a caller describing a bizarre act involving a thermometer and a screwdriver inserted into his urethra.  Greg Giraldo and Patrice O'Neal were guests throughout this final segment.

[00:07:00]  That's better.  Wow.  I guess it's Ronnie from the Ron and Fez show.  He must crank these headphones up, too.  Well, we got a lot of deaf jocks that work around here.  I'm deaf. I guess Ronnie's deaf.  Whatever. You got the pal talk working?  Yeah, finally.  Seem to be a few bugs there, right?  A few glitches as far as this computer goes, and finally got it sorted out.  Yeah, we're up and running.  All right.  There are your office cam.  I mean, two studio cams, O-Pant and O-Pant 2.  All right. 
[00:07:30]  We're ready to roll through this shit one more time for you.  Right!  Last little smile on our face and plow through this shit again.  Patrice is enjoying the radio, right?  Yeah.  And I go, yeah, it's a lot of fun.  But you get to go home, like, starting...  Well, actually, he's going to do a special show for us tomorrow night.  Yep.  From 8 to 10 p.m., a relationship show.  East Coast time.  And then he goes about his life.  Yeah.  I go, you know what's fun about this job, Patrice?  Nothing.  Ant and I will be back on those couches in our office preparing for another show.  For another stellar program. 
[00:08:00]  Jesus.  It just never ends.  I got your fucking money.  Relax.  Look at the look on his face.  That is the only thing he is concerned about right now.  And I got to tell you...  Try to fucking...  Me too.  Out of my fucking money, white boy.  My goddamn money, nigga.  Why are you getting ghetto on me?  Because we don't play that shit, nigga.  I got your money.  I got your money.  You don't make no...  That shit should have been the first thing come out your motherfucking pockets.  I...  Now I'll give you that whole, hey man, let's do it on the radio, fucking mumbo jumbo.  I said... 
[00:08:30]  I want my goddamn money, and I should get double for telling you exactly what this fucking  country was going to do last night, and why they did it.  Now wait.  I also get my money.  And I'm not asking for double.  Uh, I agree with America.  I agree with America on this one.  You're crazy.  That guy was a nut.  You're nothing but a racist if you agree with America.  I am not a racist.  I am not a racist.  America does not enjoy crazy people.  Is that the new white man's buzzword for uppity niggas? 
[00:09:00]  Crazy people.  Huh?  Is that the new white man's...  For arrogant negroes?  Is that the new buzzword?  He wasn't arrogant.  He was very...  He's nutty.  He was very sweet and likable.  How about autistic fucking Joe Cocker?  But he was...  Who's always smiling about nothing.  That guy ain't gonna be no American Idol either.  You're an idiot.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, thank you, man.  Thank you so much for calling me an idiot.  Leave Taylor Hicks alone, man.  Give me my money.  I'll give you your fucking money.  Let's get everyone into this discussion.  I'll take it in nickels if I need to.  As stated here on the program yesterday, I have said that Tweety Bird, Little Harry Potter... 
[00:09:30]  Chicken Little.  Chicken Little, known as Kevin on the show, American Idol, was not going to get kicked off.  He's too likable to too many people.  Hold on.  There might be a problem here this morning.  Problem?  Problem.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Opie, it sounds like your mic is way down yesterday and way down again today, man.  Way down?  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Alright.  Anthony and Patrice are blowing out my speakers and I can barely hear Opie.  A lot of people are saying that.  Rob in Pennsylvania.  Hey guys, we can hardly hear you out here, Opie.  What the fuck now?  What the fuck now?  What the fuck now?  If everyone's calling, that means it's gotta be a problem.  Yeah, it's gotta be a real problem.  The meters seem alright.  How bad is it in the mix?  Problem.  Is there any way to figure this out?  Oh my God. 
[00:10:30]  We have a nice energy going right off the bat and now we gotta make sure that they can hear  the broadcast?  There you go.  Just pull us back a little, put Opie, Max Opie out and hope that works.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  How's that?  How's this?  Can you hear me now?  That should be better.  Blew my ears out.  There we go.  Now we're distracted.  Nah, it's cool.  Yesterday, I said that the little kid was gonna stay. 
[00:11:00]  Little Kevin from American Idol.  He was gonna stay because America, America thinks he's a cute little kid.  The little girls and the old grandmas, which is probably the biggest demographic of American Idol,  were voting for him.  That's who got, that's why he worked through.  And that's who votes.  Yeah, that's who votes.  Don't you understand I know this stuff?  I know it from doing comedy.  Of course.  I know what these dumb people like.  Right.  And I've watched enough American Idols.  I think I watched from season like two. 
[00:11:30]  I missed the first season.  Season two up, I watched them all.  I know exactly how everything goes.  I was four for four last night.  I knew the broads they were throwing off.  I knew that Peter Brady was gonna be gone.  And I knew that the smiling black guy out the door because he's too crazy for America.  It really, Patrice, I'd like to agree with you on this, that it's this racist thing.  He's arrogant.  He wasn't very arrogant.  He was kind of likable, but he was just too weird.  Now, the Joe Cocker guy is very weird, but it's a likable weirdness. 
[00:12:00]  He was too gay.  This guy's so out there.  Yeah, too gay.  And too black.  And I don't know which one in that order, but-  You don't think that fucking fat piece of shit that one fucking-  Ruben Studdard?  Ruben Studdard was too black?  I told you that, well then, okay, that's very fair for you to say that.  So that means he was too gay and then too black because America loves Clay Aiken.  Clay Aiken's gay?  They didn't vote.  That's what I heard.  But they don't want to put together black and gay.  But they, but Clay Aiken lost because of his gayness. 
[00:12:30]  There was a guy named George Huff a couple of years ago.  His name was-  Gay black guy.  And he was a gay black guy.  Made it just so far, boom, and then out.  But also, he was another weirdo.  For some reason, gay white guys can kind of be relatable to the rest of society-  Are you alright?  In some way, shape, or form.  No, I'm just saying what it is.  They look at them and they can kind of put it out of their head.  Like Clay Aiken.  It's like, alright, we know this guy's a faggot, but look, he sings well.  Why do you think they can do that? 
[00:13:00]  I don't know.  And at least he's not black.  At least he's not black.  But the gay black guy-  Exactly.  Thank you.  I'm not just saying because he's gay and black.  I'm saying gay black guys are weirdos.  That's not true.  They're like-  Yes, they are.  They come up-  Did you see that guy-  I don't understand gay black guys.  Look at how-  Look at my loyalties.  Yeah, you.  It's black and then you're sexual.  It's like-  You're gay and weird.  Don't be disrespecting no fag niggas, man.  I'm not playing games with you.  Gay white guys are very stereotypical.  You can figure them out.  You know, he loves decorating and fucking his little dog and this, that, the other. 
[00:13:30]  Gay black guys.  This guy came on with his little film presentation before they sing.  And he had, I do a little painting and this here is a record album that's in also the earth.  And both of them spin and when they spin the music plays and everything is just great.  And America went, good, but right there I said, he is gone because of that film.  He could come out and sing-  Why, because it was just too weird?  Too weird. 
[00:14:00]  Because stupid me, I wasn't even thinking the gay thing.  I wasn't even thinking the gay thing.  It ain't all about the singing at this point in the competition.  And I watched American Idol enough to know it's not all about the singing and talent.  All right, I understand that.  So, you know, I'll follow that logic.  And so Gideon should be kicked off and then not become, you know, the next American Idol.  But, he should have made it to the next round.  This Kevin kid is a complete joke.  He fits absolutely.  And we're calling out one of our own because he's from Long Island and all that.  He fits the bill.  So you think we should support him. 
[00:14:30]  But dude, he's not even the, I was telling Patrice, he's not even the best singer in his high school.  Kelly Pickler is an awful singer out of those girls.  Kelly Pickler is an awful singer.  And she's going to get even further.  She'll be up there right at the end.  Dude, America stinks and I'm not watching the program anymore.  Don't be so surprised.  Unless someone tells me when.  I'm trying to inform you of this country every time I'm in.  Unless someone tells me when the producers and the behind the scenes people take over the voting.  Oh, and there's a conspiracy and they take over.  Because now I believe that America is really voting and deciding. 
[00:15:00]  But when does it change when they go, look, America is too irresponsible.  Never.  It doesn't.  We have to take over the fucking voting.  Never.  It doesn't.  Dude, Chicken Little sung the worst song possible.  The grandma's.  He couldn't even hide under the radar.  He was like.  Here's what they did.  Here's what they did after he sang.  After he finished.  And they still voted him in.  After his last, his last note.  Starry night.  After that.  After his last starry night vote.  Or note.  Every grandma.  Yep.  Every.  Every mother. 
[00:15:30]  Mothers.  About 37 and higher.  That have geeky kids also.  That have geeky.  They all win.  Dude.  He is a hero to people.  He shouldn't even been picked for the final.  He is a hero.  And black people do not vote on American Idol.  Black people do not.  We just hope the motherfucker we like win.  Like black people go.  Paris is a bad little motherfucker.  Yeah.  And then we go to sleep.  I hope she wins.  Oh, she got to win.  Good night.  Good night. 
[00:16:00]  We not voting.  We're not voting for like this.  This show.  We don't get on the computer and go.  Right.  You know, and we don't call and go.  Everybody, you know.  Call up.  What is that?  The last number eight.  Yeah.  It's not gonna happen.  We just go.  Now we're mad about Gideon.  Yeah.  Being discussed everywhere in the black community.  Right.  How the fuck did that little worm beat out Gideon?  You know.  But we didn't vote.  You know, let's bring everyone into the conversation that maybe doesn't watch American Idol.  Here's Gideon singing. 
[00:16:30]  We still have the clip.  Listen to this.  When a man loves a woman, can't keep his mind on nothing else.  He'd trade the world for the good thing he's found.  He'd give up all his comforts.  Sweep out in the rain.  If he'd say that's the way it ought to be. 
[00:17:00]  There you go.  There's a little taste.  Anyone remember Robert Cray?  He sounds a lot like Robert Cray.  That ain't bad.  It's a little milk toasty.  I see the rogue cast of Rent in his future.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  This is what the judges had to say.  Smokey Joe Cafe.  I like that whole record thing, man, you were doing on there.  The record, the music goes in my head.  Listen, it was alright, man.  I mean, you started it a little shaky for me, but you definitely are definitely an old 
[00:17:30]  soul in this competition.  And I like the fact that you continue that.  You know that's who you are, where you are.  And I like you hitting the big note at the end.  That kind of saved it for me for you.  So it was alright, man.  Thank you, God bless.  What did you think?  Nice way to start the show tonight.  Thank you, God bless.  I totally agree.  You are a unique sort in this whole group of contestants.  And the throwback to your style is amazing.  Even when you start with your showmanship and you flip your jacket back and you just,  you know exactly what to do.  You choreograph how you're going to move, how you're going to be, and you're a true showman. 
[00:18:00]  I think you're fantastic and you're needed in this competition.  Thank you.  See, it's all weird.  Non-relatable.  You are quite odd, aren't you?  I mean, that kind of tape beforehand, the painting and the record.  What did that signify?  It signifies my overall impression.  Variety.  What all can I do?  Okay.  I thought it was good.  I thought it was a bit cabaret, a bit over the top.  But, you know, you do what you do well.  And I like you because you're interesting.  You're kind of growing on me a bit, Gideon. 
[00:18:30]  And that's another thing.  He's a sissy too.  You think Simon?  He flirts with who he flirts with.  He used to flirt with Constantine last year.  And again, let's disclaim it by this is what I think.  He starts to get doughy eyes over some of these guys that he likes.  And he goes, he wanted to go, you're a weirdo, but mmm.  He has a track record of being with a variety of bitches, though.  Who gives a shit?  Models and shit.  Who gives a shit?  You think that's all beard?  That front.  So doesn't Tom Cruise.  That's the big cover up. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Should I bring that in?  I didn't say it.  I meant he's straight.  Look, look, look.  So let's keep it here for a second.  So, you know, he sang well to be the next American Idol.  Yeah.  Now, he got kicked off last night.  And Kevin, who sang this, did not.  It's unbelievable.  I am sorry.  It's only a starry night.  Paint your palette blue and gray. 
[00:19:30]  Look out on a summer's day.  With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.  Now I think I know what you tried to say to me.  In his defense, the song stinks.  His lisp is awful.  But it was one of his best vocal performances that he ever did.  He's on key.  He's been all over the place off key on a lot of his songs. 
[00:20:00]  He was actually on key on this song.  And he said, wait, I want to hear this.  I want to hear this story.  I want to hear the starry story again.  Sorry now.  But still your love was true.  And when all hope was left inside.  On that starry story night.  You took your life as lovers of dead and due.  But I could have told you, Vincent. 
[00:20:30]  This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.  As you.  A starry story night.  It's Drek.  The motherfucker who originally sent this song.  Stop.  Yeah.  That would be Don McClain.  Is it?  Oof.  I have no idea.  You know what though?  If it was about what we just did, then they wouldn't need a show.  They could just play a tape of the audio. 
[00:21:00]  It's not a singing contest.  I understand.  There's more to it.  It's called American Idol.  There's more to it.  American people vote.  They are voting barely on the singing.  If you really fuck the singing up, it's going to hurt you.  You're going to be thrown out.  But if both of them do a good enough job singing, it comes down to other things.  Patrice could say it's black white.  It's fag.  Not fag.  It's that.  The bottom line is the guy, the little wormy kid, was more appealing for some reason 
[00:21:30]  to mainstream America than the gay black weird guy.  Have you talked to anybody that ever voted on American Idol?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've never even met anybody that voted.  My stupid family.  They vote?  Yeah.  My mother talks about, oh, I voted for this one, my aunt.  Who did she vote for?  Get her on the phone.  I don't know this season.  Get her on the phone.  Well, later on.  Well, I know she's not going to vote for the black guy.  That's honest.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Let's call a spade a spade here and just say she's a...  I'm not racist.  I thought he was a little crazy. 
[00:22:00]  Thank you, Ms. Coomier.  I learned some of my best sayings, my best racist sayings when I was a little kid from  dear old mom and dad.  Who's this nigga on my porch, Anthony?  That's some of her favorite sayings.  I learned nigga rich from my parents when I would have my allowance in my pocket and  I'd be in a store with my parents and stuff and I'd want to buy something right away.  Like, what?  Fucking nigga rich over here?  Put your money away.  Save it.  And then it was when I'd be like, Mom, could you get me something out of the cabinet? 
[00:22:30]  She goes, what am I?  Three shades darker than you.  And it was...  This is every Italian family.  Oh my God.  Every Italian...  It was just like one after the other after the other.  You have to have fucking Father Maris come over and get your racism out of you.  You have to get a Bible and exercise your racism out of you, motherfucker.  Once I got out into the real world and started working a friggin' blue collared construction  job for a living, then you work with people.  It's real life.  And that's where you make your life decisions.  That's it.  I've met white people I can't fucking stand. 
[00:23:00]  I've met black people I can't fucking stand.  And that's how it works.  And for some reason, when a white guy can't stand a black guy, it's gotta be racism.  It can't just be the black guy's a fucking asshole.  That's not true.  A lot of times it's true.  I know that America, on this particular thing...  Lookit, how can you deny my reasoning and it all came true?  Well, both of you guys were in agreement.  I was the one like, no way is America gonna do this.  Yeah, but we're worlds apart on why we have our state results.  I understand that.  Gideon's gone.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  So when the voting went down, it took literally a half a second and my phone is just text messaging away.  And it's Patrice saying, have my money, nigga.  I mean, like...  Like you're gonna get hurt.  Yeah, like Gideon wasn't even off the stage yet and he pushed send.  That's a scary text message to get.  Give me my money, nigga.  Oh, shit.  Like he had this already...  It's over American Idol.  He had this already written and he was just waiting to push send. 
[00:24:00]  So then I attempted to write Patrice back, but this freaking Pebble phone that I got, I don't know.  Yeah.  It's set to type in Japanese.  It's set for Jap.  I saw some Japanese words coming out of that thing.  So I was writing Patrice back and I had no idea I was writing them in Japanese.  Yeah.  And then I finally figured out we had a little back and forth.  And then Patrice...  Have my yin, bitch.  And then Patrice said it all with this text message.  Hooray America.  Black, charismatic, sissy, unacceptable. 
[00:24:30]  Little, talentless, bird-body asshole that reminds them of Harry Potter treasured.  Yeah.  Very good.  He looks like a little Harry Potter type thing with the glasses.  They love him.  And America loves him.  Thinks he's adorable.  And he'll go, alrighty.  There it is.  And don't throw it with disrespect.  Oh, I'll throw it right at your big head.  There it is.  You freaking...  You fold it up and you put it in my wallet.  Nice.  That'll happen.  You fold it up and stick it in my fucking wallet. 
[00:25:00]  You're lucky I don't take this under protest.  That's it.  I have faith in the American people.  Now we can function as a team.  Next week's can be a little rougher.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think...  No, it's not.  I'll pick it right now, too.  Good.  I'll pick it right now, too.  Bucky's going.  Yep.  Bucky's gone.  And Kevin.  Oh, my God.  And Kevin?  Dude, I'm not sure about Kevin.  Oh, come on.  It's a toss-up right now between Kevin and the other guy with the bald head. 
[00:25:30]  What the hell's his name?  Oh, uh...  Not the rocker guy.  The guy that looks like an elf.  Yeah, he's kind of weird.  He got the hearing loss he talked about the other day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I forgot his name, too.  But toss-up between Kevin and that guy.  Ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to make a mind-blowing synopsis.  All right.  And we can bet if you like.  Okay.  America finally gets rid of that fucking artistic retard, Taylor.  No way!  No, they love him. 
[00:26:00]  He fucking goes.  $20, he doesn't go next week.  $20, Taylor is out.  All right.  Bet's on.  Yeah, Taylor is in.  Taylor is in.  Taylor is out.  Motherfucker.  Let me tell you something.  Nobody likes Taylor.  There will be three guys left.  He's going to be one of them.  Absolutely.  Three guys left.  He will be one of them.  I'm going to explain how it works.  I'm going to give it to you.  I'm going for my 20 back.  You going for it?  I'm in on the bet too.  Taylor Hicks stays.  Let me tell you something about what's going on.  Okay.  You vote for your favorite.  Yeah.  You don't vote. 
[00:26:30]  If they voted for who they think should go.  Right.  You're not voting people off.  Right.  True.  That means I would bet that Kevin would go because people would go, get him out of here.  Yeah.  But the fact is people that needed to vote for Gideon did not vote for Gideon.  People who needed to vote for the good looking, the Italian looking kid, whoever votes, they  voted.  25 million little girls voted for him.  Then the second most amount voted for the rocker. 
[00:27:00]  Then the second most, Taylor might not have been the, he's, people aren't liking him.  I feel it.  I have a sense of this culture.  I don't know.  They are loving him.  They are loving him.  I'm seeing it completely different.  It's something not genuine about his, that horse shit he does.  He's a weirdo.  He's not Forrest Gump.  It's like, it's a, it's a play.  But the American people aren't you, Patrice.  You're a very street wise and sharp guy.  American public, very stupid.  They're buying his act.  Even if it is a complete act and he's playing off this lovable, weird kind of quirky guy, 
[00:27:30]  America will love him.  He took it to the streets the other night.  Come on.  Taking it to the streets.  To the streets.  Did you see what you just did?  Who's enjoying that shit?  Everybody, bro.  America.  Everybody.  America is enjoying that.  With that, with that dry hair.  That fucking gray straw.  Yeah, that, that's, it looks like it's, it looks like it's, uh, it could be, it's fire.  It's like, what do they call it?  It's flammable. 
[00:28:00]  It looks like mattress stuffing.  Oh, he's got straw hair.  Mattress stuffing.  Hey, listen, let's go to Julie in Massachusetts.  Julie.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was calling, uh, my stupid skank of a sister voted for that chicken little guy 178 times.  Holy shit.  That is the problem.  There you go.  You can vote more than once.  And they're bragging last night that they got 47 million votes, but they don't tell you  that a lot of people are voting, uh, more than once.  They can vote for more.  Yeah.  More than once.  What's the significance of 178 times? 
[00:28:30]  Like she just stopped at 178?  Yeah.  She doesn't have a man in her life.  I think that's a problem.  And she's like little boys.  How old is she?  She is 25.  All right.  She's a sick woman.  Get her, uh, help.  But what's the number?  What's the number?  Like why not 100 or why not 200?  200.  I don't know.  I watched her do it.  She did text messaging and she, you know, and, and she used her friend's cell phone and  called and I'm, she just has no life.  I like Chris Daltrey, the bald rocker guy.  She likes that.  That guy's going to be right there as the winner. 
[00:29:00]  Uh, it will be, I think, I think.  Him and Big Mama.  Yeah.  At the end, you're going to see him.  And Big Mama.  Uh, and Big Mama.  Uh, those I think are going to be the last.  I agree with that.  Fred in Brooklyn.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Fred.  Hey, um, when they showed those little stools where the last final 12 were going to be sitting.  Yeah.  And when they chose Mandisa as one of the final 12, I couldn't wait to see that end.  And it just poured over.  Dude.  Oh, that seems like a butt plug for her.  Dude, one cheek was able to sit on that stool. 
[00:29:30]  Cool.  And everyone had to move from both sides of her.  I know there's a lot of guys.  It was like a water balloon on a golf tee.  It was fucking crazy.  It just poured over the top.  Now, tell the truth.  Aren't you getting a little bit, like, in a fetish-y kind of way?  Don't you want a piece of Mandisa?  Ugh.  Oh.  There is nothing good about that.  Nothing.  Nothing.  There is nothing good about that.  That's my man in Brooklyn.  Doesn't he want a little piece?  Tell the truth.  Nothing there on that one.  No.  Not even a piece of Mandisa.  Not even to try to climb up in there.  No. 
[00:30:00]  Not even a drop of Mandisa.  Nah, nah, nah.  Our guest is here.  By the way, Ryan Seacrest is always attacking Simon Cowell for being too mean and all that.  Oh, of course.  And anyone else notice that Ryan Seacrest's whole job last night was to try to make the  people that were getting kicked off to cry?  Uh-huh.  That's his job.  Isn't that a little meaner than what Simon Cowell's doing?  He is the meanest guy on the show.  He also tries to trip people up into thinking they made it and then they get kicked off. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, he's the one that's really fucking with the intestines.  You are not going to be going home if home was the seat here because you are going home.  Why?  You know that they tell him to do that.  Yeah.  I think the meanest thing on the whole show-  Yeah, but that's okay, but for him to go after Simon Cowell for being too mean and not  giving him constructive criticism, it's bullshit.  I think the meanest thing-  Because like Ed said, he's the meanest guy on the show, but he's making believe he's  not.  But they're both told to be like that.  Of course. 
[00:31:00]  Put it this way.  Let's say the producers are the meanest people on the show because they actually have the  people sing the song that said, get the fuck out of here.  After they're thrown out.  Yeah.  Leave, bitch.  And then, you know what?  Before you go, sing this shit that made you leave.  Yeah.  But now sing it worse because you're fucking all emotional.  Because you're crying and shaking and don't care anymore because there's nothing in it  for you.  Right.  Sing the lousy song.  Let's dance for love.  We got a big celebrity that's going to be in the studio in a few minutes here.  Might want to turn that toward the mic. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Here's Ryan Seacrest.  His whole job last night was to try to get the people getting kicked off to cry.  Sorry.  Stop.  Yeah.  And he succeeded with the basketball player.  The girl basketball player who's like six, whatever she is, like five or something.  Right.  I know it's not easy.  There's nothing fun about it, especially after all that hard work.  But think about what you've been able to do.  You know, think about all of the wonderful things you've been able to accomplish on the  show. 
[00:32:00]  He's trying.  You hear this?  He's so trying to get it a crack.  You hear this?  He's pulling at those heart strings.  Yep.  The show, the fans that you've won over out there.  Lots of people watched you, loved you, and voted, you know.  So if you make it to this point, think of the thousands that line up, darling.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye, baby.  Back to your empty life.  Bye-bye.  Come on.  Goodbye.  Come on.  You know your career's over.  Think of all of the things you've been through. 
[00:32:30]  What has been the toughest and possibly the most valuable lesson that you can take away?  The most valuable lesson for me personally has been to realize what's important in life.  And I've learned a lot being out here, not necessarily, I mean, I've always worked hard  in school and everything, but just knowing what's important and working hard for something  that you're really passionate about.  And I was really passionate about basketball, but, you know, equally as passionate about something 
[00:33:00]  like this.  I never cried.  I never cried.  I never cried.  I never cried.  I never cried.  It's okay to cry because you care.  It's okay to show that emotion.  Ryan Seacrest is a phony fuck, man.  You see when that last white girl made it, the one that we thought would go off, the one  that it does suck.  Yeah.  And she made it the very last thing.  You see, she ran up to Paris to, like, give her that I'm still here hug and Paris was  like, bitch, get out, man. 
[00:33:30]  Get your fucking hands off me.  You're so gone next week.  She's the skanky one that's left.  She does look dirty, right?  She looks like a dirty girl.  She has a funny smell somewhere.  Singing in those smoky bars in the south.  Like her shoulders stink.  Yeah.  Like her shoulders.  She's got stinky shoulders.  Want to say hi to Burt Young or what, man?  Yes.  Burt Young is here.  Stopping by to say hi.  It's been Burt Young.  He brought his gangsta like his maid brother with him.  Yeah, I know, right?  Let's not fuck with these guys.  Doesn't he look like the head of a mob family?  Oh, my God.  Absolutely does.  He does look like he should be in a robe. 
[00:34:00]  There he is.  Burt Young.  Burt Young.  Hello, guys.  How are you doing, man?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  He is a real star.  A real guy that's been in movies on our show, Opie.  It's about time.  None of these guys.  Across 110th Street.  I just watched that the other day.  Wow.  Yes, sir.  Across 110th Street.  Gangsta got shot in the first scene.  I was under the school.  Old school, man.  Before the credits came up.  Done.  Anthony Quinn.  Fucking Burt Young, man. 
[00:34:30]  Anthony Quinn.  That's it.  Is that your brother out there?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can tell.  That's my brother Bobby.  What's up, Bobby?  He's going to make sure that it runs smoothly, right?  Yeah, he will.  He'll come right through the window.  I know he will.  You guys look like you should be conducting some business over some espresso in a back room  somewhere.  We have.  I don't doubt it.  We have, man.  This is great.  We usually have dopey reality stars here, and here's an authentic movie star.  Not playing around.  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Well, very excited.  Rocky Balboa coming out.  Yeah.  I guess you guys done shooting?  Finished shooting.  A couple weeks ago.  Finished shooting.  I saw the teaser for it.  I think that's been leaked out or something on the internet.  I don't know about it.  Yeah.  And it just shows Sylvester Stallone really kind of banged up.  Bruiser looks like he's kind of in a corner somewhere.  Just a face shot.  And he's just, it's a voiceover of what's going on in his head about being a little older,  a little older, being older, and still having to do what he does. 
[00:35:30]  And pretty, it got me.  You know, I was like, I want to see what's going on here.  Because a lot of people were a little skeptical about hearing that, you know, another Rocky movie's  If you think of the same formula of the Rocky movies, he is older, it's not going to work.  How does this work with an older Rocky Balboa?  It was, of course, a question to all of us, himself.  But he took it like an exclamation mark, I think, on his life, really. 
[00:36:00]  He's been a man possessed.  Yeah.  Sylvester himself.  He's like Michelangelo.  And I think he built the scaffold himself.  He won't leave the set.  He made himself into a shape that's brilliant.  Just brilliant.  But he don't try to disguise his age.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  It's a one fight thing.  It's not a career move.  It's against the devils that he has in his belly.  His belly he can't chase from life, his wife, just life in general.  I think a lot of people are a little worried that it was going to be him trying to seem  younger than he is, where the rest of the Rocky movies were, that kind of a head on it. 
[00:37:00]  But if you think of the reality of boxing, a lot of these guys do go a little too long.  Look at George Foreman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  Not to 67.  If Rocky Balboa is selling hamburger griddles at the end of that movie, I'm going to be  pissed off.  Dan, dan, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Paulie's selling.  Oh, you're selling?  Yeah, Paulie's selling.  Yeah.  Now, that makes sense.  That makes perfect sense.  Foreman got out in time, though.  Paulie was trying to turn a buck off of Rocky, man.  Foreman got out in time, though. 
[00:37:30]  Is this the all-time most sequels for one movie?  That's a great question.  Wow.  This is going to be Rocky 7 officially, right?  I think for a legitimate movie, you do things like Friday the 13th, they go up to-  Oh, that's right.  27.  14, something like that.  This is a lot of movies, though, yeah.  But this was 15 years in between.  Right.  Which is amazing.  That's a long time.  The one with Tommy Morrison was 15 years ago?  15 years ago.  That's right.  Holy shit.  What?  That is a long time, man.  Yeah.  And what's changed with you, with your character over the course of 15 years? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, he's gotten so much wiser.  Really?  No.  Of course not.  He still wants a job.  He's still Paulie.  He's still a painter.  What about me?  I don't sweat you.  I don't sweat you.  One of the best scenes of the fight in the garage where Rocky's just going to be like,  you know, what are you doing?  I could just hit, I could blow on you and you're down on the ground.  Rocky 3, best one without challenge.  Yeah.  Mr. T.  Mr. T. 
[00:38:30]  You liked Rocky 3 the best?  I liked Rocky 3.  I liked Rocky 3.  I liked one, man.  You have a favorite?  One and three.  One is the, well, I think you gotta give one the best because it really set the whole  thing up.  I don't even count one because it's another, it's like Jaws and then something else.  Right.  And then all the rest?  Yeah.  It is what it is.  And then the rest, out of the rest.  It's three.  Three is just, oh my God.  If you watch anything with the longevity of the Rocky movies or even a sitcom or something,  you notice how the characters from the beginning kind of evolve into something a little different  toward the end of it. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And that happened with the Rocky movies.  You watch the Rocky character, Talia Shire playing Adrian, her character in the first Rocky.  And then as it progressed on, you really saw a change where it was like, it was a little  unrealistic, especially as far as Adrian went, where I think they did a goof on it on  Saturday Night Live years ago also.  She's all mousy and wearing the little thing and then at the end of the fight she comes  running out in a dress and she's got all this confidence and everything.  But your character's been pretty consistent through the movies. 
[00:39:30]  Well, that's because I'm simple-minded.  I can't expand or, you know, just, Paulie, Paulie has his own fun, his own wants, but usually  they're limited.  But this here piece that he made now, which is exciting, is that the spirit of horror sort  of motivates both men in different ways. 
[00:40:00]  Was that a conscious decision to kill the character off?  Or did Talia say she didn't want to do it?  Or, because it seems odd to have such a major character like that.  I won't even say that she was killed off.  All right.  All right.  I'm ruining things for everybody.  Whoops!  No, no, that's okay.  I won't.  What I've read on a little thing called the internet.  You might want to wipe the slate clean of this internet thing.  She pops up as a ghost.  Yeah.  Because the truth is, she's-  Still alive.  So much. 
[00:40:30]  She peoples the whole film.  Mm-hmm.  In one way or another.  They're wrong.  Wipe it off that goddamn-  Wipe it off the whole goddamn internet?  It might take a few minutes.  He's gonna beat up that computer and get to it.  I think it might be good though for Rocky, because for once she can't turn around and  go, you can't win, Rock.  Right.  And he could turn around and go, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  How about-  There was so many times when she was-  How about you be an optimist for once?  Could you get behind me from the beginning of the movie here, lady? 
[00:41:00]  And he goes, is that what you want to hear?  All right?  Is that what you want to hear?  I'm scared, all right?  We're all scared.  And then it works out and he kicks some ass.  I love the Rock movies.  He always makes him kick a hat.  Yeah.  You have a family.  It's time to quit.  Hey, gigweed.  It's all I know.  Sounds like he was watching the movie.  I love the movie.  I catch him.  Any of the Rockies are one of those movies where if you're going around the channels 
[00:41:30]  and you see a part of it, you gotta, oh, you gotta stop.  You gotta see what's going on.  There's not one you don't watch.  I hate Rocky 5.  I must crush you.  Yeah.  I'm gonna watch that one.  I hate Rocky 5.  I must crush you.  I've seen it a million times already.  Yeah.  But you know what?  You're gonna get a great kick out of it.  You're gonna find in this movie, you're gonna find a fellow that, you remember the  first one, the first ugly fight he had with the Spider Rico? 
[00:42:00]  Uh-huh.  He's in the movie.  Really?  Yeah.  We found him.  And he was a very important fighter at one time in life.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And he's in the movie.  The whole movie of Rocky Balboa is peopled with people from 35 years ago that we worked  with.  35.  That's when the first Rocky came out?  Yeah.  That was 35 years ago.  It's, it's like shocking, you know?  It, uh, first of all, they got old looking. 
[00:42:30]  Now what's the guy's name?  One of the, one of the, the great, um, secondary Italian actors.  It was, it was in every movie in the 70s.  I loved, he played Cheech in, um, in Godfather.  Oh, in Godfather, yeah.  He was in his original Rocky.  Uh-huh.  Is that, is he still around?  He was the, uh, yeah, one of the guys that wanted Rocky to be the leg breaker.  No.  He was good.  Yeah.  He died.  Oh, he's not around?  A long time ago.  Love that guy.  A talented actor. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He was in the Godfather, he was in the Rocky, yeah.  Always played a gangster type.  Yeah.  I'll get his name.  I'm dead.  All I know of him is Cheech from, you know, Godfather.  Yeah.  You know, and I, but I was just wondering, because some of those characters that are  in there, is the son in this one?  Uh, no.  No son?  No son.  What's, what's your, uh, what's your take on, uh, Italian actors and, cause some, some  people get a little annoyed at the, um, the, uh, uh, portrayals of Italian Americans  as actors and, and the mobsters and stuff with the Sopranos, things like that.  Sopranos starting up Sunday. 
[00:43:30]  He was in the Sopranos.  And, and, uh, I, I'm an Italian and I think it's, it's great.  I love it.  I love that, that portion of the whole thing.  I like the mob movies and, but there are some people that get upset with that.  How do you, how do you feel about that?  That, uh, sometimes they're just portrayed as mobsters.  Well, you got your, you know, you got talented actors, talented writers and not.  Uh, Sopranos, I kind of look at as a, an American, uh, Shakespeare.  I, I think they're, they're careful. 
[00:44:00]  I, I think the plots are, uh, are as deep as Freud in many cases with, with exciting,  uh, uh, background.  Uh, this fellow, David Chase, who produces it is a perfectionist.  He, he, he watches the extras being hired.  He watches everything.  He can't let a thing go by.  Yeah.  He, and, and the whole company is, uh, a proud, hospitable, warm to work with. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, some are shoddy, other movies.  Uh, and, and, and, and you avoid them.  But there are people that are, uh, there are Italians that are out there that actually  don't want these movies made.  They don't want, uh, Italians portrayed as gangsters.  And, and, and, and it's part of history.  I mean, what are you going to do?  I want to see everybody portrayed in a negative way.  Is that what you want to portray?  I don't want to see anyone portrayed positively. 
[00:45:00]  It bores the fuck out of me.  Isn't that boring?  Even black movies where, let's go see Poetry on the Mind starring everybody,  Poetry on the Mind.  I don't give a shit.  No, you want to see sideways guns.  I want to see somebody get shot out of a window.  Someone getting ganked.  I don't want my Italians being, Moonstruck make me throw up.  I want to see, I want to see some dude tell me he's going to skull fuck me.  I don't want to see that.  I don't want to see every Chinese Yakuza.  I want to see Russian Ma.  I don't want to, who wants to see it?  That's the exciting stuff.  Yeah.  Who cares about you? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  The fact that we're good to be pulling them with the boob.  I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  That's, that's for regular life.  You cook spaghetti?  Right.  Keep your niceness and treating people well for regular life.  In my movies, I want a little action.  That's what I want to see.  Okay.  Yeah.  And Bert's an artist, by the way.  Really?  You're in town doing an art show?  Yes.  I paint.  You paint?  Besides houses and walls.  Yeah, walls a little bit.  I, yeah, I'm pretty.  What would you consider yourself, what type of style of painting? 
[00:46:00]  Abstract landscapes?  What do you do?  Abstract landscapes?  Picasso?  Um, what the hell am I?  Bobby, my brother, I think I'm a, you could say an impressionist.  Yeah.  I, I do whatever the hell I feel.  I'm an impressionist too.  Watch this.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.  Say that was an impressionist.  That was Ronald Reagan.  Very good.  Say I'm an impressionist.  Didn't you have one of your pictures in a movie, was featured in a movie at some point? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Was there one dog looking one way, one dog looking the other, a guy in the middle going,  what do you want from me?  Motherfucker, that's what I was thinking.  Are you kidding me?  I swear on my mother.  From Goodfellas.  I thought that you painted the, he's like, what are you looking at?  We're at Pesci's mother's house.  Yes.  Eating pasta.  No.  And they showed a painting.  You thought that was Burt Young's painting?  I thought that was Burt Young's painting.  Why would you think that?  You don't think in the credits there would be a thing that says, and Burt Young's painting.  Burt Young's painting.  Why did you say that?  Because that's the only fucking painting you would know. 
[00:47:00]  What, last time you were at the Louvre?  Get out of here.  Oh, the Louvre.  Yes.  Yes.  The Louvre-y.  The Louvre.  There's a little hooah house right across the street.  Get out of here.  No one knows it.  Really?  I discovered it.  Now let's get into some stuff.  Who knew?  No, it was wonderful.  Yeah?  And you go downstairs, there's boots downstairs.  But it was right across.  Isn't that something?  The Corsican guy run the joint. 
[00:47:30]  It was a little narrow joint.  Right across.  It was so great.  How long ago was that?  A while.  Four or five years ago.  Are you married?  No, no.  No, I wouldn't dare to.  Yeah, right?  He's talking about that.  That's your past.  You can talk about what you did before.  Have you ever had groupies in the heyday?  Was it like, oh my god, that's Bert Younger?  Like jump on me and stuff?  You know, like you was living that life that we all try to live.  I wished.  Yeah?  I never got jumped on too much. 
[00:48:00]  By bouncers and stuff.  But not by the right girls.  Approached by the shapes.  Probably approached by a few ladies though in a bar maybe or something like that.  But now we're like, you know.  Yeah.  But he's got the whore house.  Yeah, you got the.  From the Louvre.  From the Louvre.  From the Louvre.  That's a story.  You look at some pieces at the Louvre and then you knock one off at the whore house.  There's a lot of good whores in front of Notre Dame.  Nice.  I've got.  I never.  You know something?  Now forever.  Any time I hear about the Louvre, see pictures of the Louvre from the Louvre, I'm going  to think, you know there's a whore house right across the street from there? 
[00:48:30]  Bert Young told me.  What do you think Mona Lisa got that grin on her face?  After I finish with her.  Oh, that's great man.  Let's go to George in Jersey.  Hey George, what's up?  Hey, morning guys.  Morning Bert.  Hello.  Listen, I just wanted to say thanks for playing one of the greatest gangster characters ever  as Bed Bug Eddie in the Pope of Greenwich Village.  Oh, yeah.  Bed Bug Eddie.  I've never seen that movie.  Oh, come on.  I never got to it.  Tomorrow.  Eric Roberts, right?  And I never got to it, man. 
[00:49:00]  One of the greatest gangster movies ever made.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  That's great.  Do you want to hear, what's your first name again?  George.  George?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was supposed to be James Caan and Al Pacino.  That was how it was originally tried to be cast.  That movie was cast perfectly with you guys.  As it turned out, it was perfectly cast.  Yeah.  Yeah, let them do other movies.  Charlie and Paulie.  Thank you.  I'm strong. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you for your care.  That's awesome.  He poisoned me in that son of a bitch.  Yeah.  That was a good one, man.  That was a good one, man.  Oh, yeah.  Good quotes from that movie, right?  Yep.  Who was the other guy that was in?  That was a good one.  James Russo was in it, right?  No.  Mickey Rourke.  Mickey Rourke.  Mickey Rourke.  Eric Roberts.  Yeah.  Julia's brother.  Yeah.  So that must have been something, though, going back to the same characters with Rocky after  15 years.  Did you have to catch up?  Was a lot of just, you know, because I know some people I hook up with and you could just 
[00:50:00]  start a conversation again like it was yesterday and other people you kind of grow apart from.  A lot of people on the cast, though, are you still familiar with?  Have you kept in touch?  Yeah.  As much as, you know, it's a crazy community.  We think in Hollywood, you know what it is, though, the layman thinks in Hollywood, like  you're hanging out at Rocky's house and, you know, hey, come on down, and that's the  way it is for 15 years, and then you're on screen again.  Yeah.  You don't realize that much time goes by. 
[00:50:30]  I try to think back 15 years, and if I just kind of had to work again with the people  I worked with 15 years ago, that would be a little weird.  Yeah.  Did you have to get into the groove of it?  Well, that's what was exciting.  Yeah.  To meet, especially in the fight life.  Mm-hmm.  I saw old timers.  Mike Tyson was there.  I saw old referees that I knew from my old days before acting.  Wow.  And that was exciting stuff.  You used the box?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  And he kept everybody.  And all those talking heads on HBO, they were there.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, right, as the announcers and everything, the commentators.  Yeah, remarkable.  It was just exciting.  And his, his, he was really, like, possessed.  Yeah.  He just couldn't let go.  And he's still, he's in the editing room right now, probably.  You got to see him from the time where, you know, he was selling his own script or trying  to and then making his own movie up to the point now where he's, you know, an American icon, legendary Hollywood superstar. 
[00:51:30]  Did you see any, any changes in him?  Because, you know, you were there at intervals during the movies.  Any changes in him as a person during that whole period of time?  Well, he always, he always was impatient.  Yeah.  He just couldn't understand downtime at all.  Yeah.  Uh, I saw he got a little fat and complacent in the middle of it.  Ha ha ha.  And then he realized he better wake up. 
[00:52:00]  And on this one, I think he put all, all plus the energy he did for the first one.  Mm-hmm.  In his writing.  In his commitment.  Uh, uh, I, I really literally had perhaps one of the best movie times ever this last  one out.  Really?  Yeah.  When's the movie coming out by the way?  We think it's, uh, it'll be December release.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Are you in the whole movie?  You're like second, second on the credit, uh, thing there? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm big stuff.  You're big enough?  I'm big stuff.  Is there some evil black villain?  Like, you know, Sugar, Sugar Ray Johnson?  No.  No.  You know, you know who the, the opponent is, is, uh, uh, Antonio Carver, who's the light  heavyweight champ.  Antonio Carver.  Yep.  Evil black villain.  Evil black villain.  Evil black villain.  Ugh!  I just knocked out Roy Jones.  Ugh!  But the two.  Oh, she dead?  Mmm!  I'll fuck your dead wife. 
[00:53:00]  Ugh!  But he's not evil.  That's the taste.  He's not evil.  He's not evil.  He's just a nice guy.  Mr. T was evil, man.  Mmm!  Mmm!  Mmm!  Woman!  He was just such a great bad guy.  Hey, woman!  Hey, woman!  You want, why don't you come up my place head of a real man?  Ah, shit, man.  A real man.  I fucking love Rocky Goddamn.  That was fantastic.  You can't win, Rocky.  It was fantastic, man.  You can't win.  Yeah.  He got...  That scene...  Rocky III was him.  I don't sweat you. 
[00:53:30]  He threw the...  He threw the bottle through the Rocky pinball machine.  Yeah.  And then fought him.  And then he's just...  He gets tired.  He just...  Can I get a job?  Yeah.  You know?  Rocky's like...  I don't know.  I got dignity.  And then...  Hulk Hogan.  Oh, my love slaves out there.  Yeah.  Thunder lives his hair in the flesh, baby.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  It was a great movie, man.  I really love Rocky III to my heart.  Yeah, that was...  That's a great one.  Let me give you the...  That pinball...  The end of the pinball, I end up in the can. 
[00:54:00]  And he bails me out.  Right, right, right.  Yep.  And he had given me a watch.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  But the watch was a Timex.  Timex.  And he gave gold Timex's to Rocky, to the producer.  They didn't give me nothing.  And so I was supposed to say, I don't want your lousy Timex watch.  So I took it off.  He says, I don't want your lousy X-Lax watch. 
[00:54:30]  And they had to keep it.  I don't want that lousy X-Lax.  They laughed at you.  That was a flub?  No flub.  I did it on purpose.  Oh.  And Sylvester gave me a Cartier.  Oh, wow.  Is that it there?  Is that it there?  Yeah.  Oh, my...  That's a gold card, yeah?  That's nice.  He wrote in the back.  You need bifocals to read it.  Oh, my goodness.  That's pretty cool.  You're brave giving that to Patrice, man.  No kidding, man.  Yeah, I'm watching.  He's my guy, but he can run it real fast.  My brother, my brother. 
[00:55:00]  Fucking...  Jerry, what are you fucking at about?  Give me that nigga to fucking watch.  Did you lose it?  Did you get punched in scene 12?  Are you...  This brother's eyeing you up, though, man.  He's...  Love slime, man.  It's...  And it's...  It's written with hand.  It's...  It's like engraved with something.  Wow.  Like his handwriting or something.  That's cool.  That is really cool, man.  All right, I'm giving Burt Young back the watch.  Everybody can see.  Bubby, I got it back. 
[00:55:30]  Gave me all clear.  His hand came back out of his pocket.  Look, all right.  All clear.  You're getting a little liberal there, man.  We're all clear.  We're all clear.  All clear.  Everything's all right.  Goddamn.  Give me the thumbs up.  Everything's okay here.  That's a beautiful watch, man.  A gold carrier.  That is nice.  Serious business.  That was from his own pocket.  It was nice.  Well, Burt Young is here to promote his art show.  The U.S. debut is, what, here in New York on March 10th?  That's today?  Yes.  At the Jade Nectar Gallery? 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  Ugh.  Where's that?  We don't really go to art museums a lot.  Well, you guys should show up.  Yeah.  We'll show up.  You could tear the place apart.  I should get some of that, what they call culture.  I had a show in Montreal.  And it was huge, I hear.  It's a Gallery 1225.  Right.  It was very successful in Montreal.  It was wonderful.  It was lovely.  And these are friends of mine, and it's an artist who owns it, Lana Santorelli. 
[00:56:30]  Okay.  And her work is represented also.  Okay.  And it's on the, what the hell is it?  Cooper.  I really don't know where it is.  Maybe we can get...  62 Cooper Street, I think.  62 Cooper Street.  The Jade Nectar Gallery.  Look at the...  Yeah.  Look at the info and plug it.  Oh, yeah.  And it's an impressive gallery.  And the woman who owns it, I think she's more talented than me.  Her work is wonderful.  I just... 
[00:57:00]  We were friends for many years, but I just really saw her work.  And it was exciting for me.  Are you selling it?  Like, is...  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Well, some...  I really want...  I want people to say, oh, god damn.  He...  He paints.  He's an artist.  I like that feeling.  I'm gonna...  I like to go into a way and just do what the hell I want.  No producer, no director.  Just... 
[00:57:30]  No, it's nothing you gotta do.  I got a big empty house.  Maybe I can use Bert Young on the wall.  You don't have to figure out what...  Like, I don't have to interpret your stuff.  I can just see it go, okay, that's a...  Yes.  That's a shark or whatever.  I don't have to go...  No.  Two lines and it's like, wow, I fit...  No.  It's actually art.  No.  You got the eyeballs all in the right place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what...  I like that art.  You know, I like that.  I'm not deep enough for that.  Great.  Are you gonna be there all day, Bert?  Yeah.  What time are you gonna be there today?  I'm gonna...  I'll try to be there six o'clock at night. 
[00:58:00]  They're gonna probably feed me.  Okay.  And the folks, Amal, from Montreal, are coming in.  And like I said, we're all friends.  Right.  So this should be...  I'm very excited about the whole thing.  That's great, man.  And then meeting this goofy room...  Yeah.  This is a way to start the day.  This will wake you up a little bit.  Whew.  Hey, there's a lot of truckers that wanna say hi to you.  From the...  Truckers love the show.  Well, they love the movie Convoy. 
[00:58:30]  Scott in Ohio.  Hey, Bert.  I just wanna thank you for your role as Love Machine with your warm water water bed in  the back of your Mac.  Jesus.  When the hell did you see that one?  From the movie Convoy.  Did you...  Oh, Convoy!  Man!  I know.  That was Sam Peckinpah.  Yeah, he played Love Machine.  Love Machine.  I was attractive.  I was attractive.  That's going back when they can make a movie based on nothing but the CB craze.  Yeah.  Well, you know Peckinpah thought that was a revolutionary movie.  Really? 
[00:59:00]  He actually thought he was gonna walk away from the government with that.  Really?  He thought great things with the idea of it.  Peckinpah made some great movies.  That wasn't one of them.  I don't think.  No.  But he was fun.  Yeah?  He was a crazy man.  All right.  Let's go to Mark at Long Island.  Mark, what's up?  Hey guys, you missed...  Hey Anthony, you missed one of the greatest lines from the Pope of Greenwich Village.  Which one?  You remember the old lady smoking a tarry tin and she says,  My water was tough as a bag of iron. 
[00:59:30]  You're right.  That was a great actress.  Right.  What was her name?  Do you remember?  No.  No.  She died.  She was talented.  She was married to another great guy.  Jesus.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  You've known too many people over your career.  Yeah, a lot of people.  That's what it is.  Just too many punches.  A lot of movies.  You didn't see across the 125th, no, across the 110th Street.  No.  Did you? 
[01:00:00]  Anthony Quinn, Yafet Kodo.  Really?  That's right.  Burt Young.  That's wild.  That was...  I have to check that one out.  I was running...  I was doing numbers at that time, so I was on the phone.  They hated me.  I was so busy trying to keep everything going.  I had a little tiny part.  Like, I was killed under the credits.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  It says your first role was a hunchback in 19...  But the 100, across the 110th Street was before 1970, right?  They might mess it up.  The first one was I was a hunchback. 
[01:00:30]  1972.  I had a name of John Fields or something.  Yeah.  And that, the hunchback was shot in Coney Island.  Man.  Another one where you bought it, huh?  So you wasn't...  You kind of like got there like, what, around 30?  You started hitting off in the movies?  Yeah.  That's right.  I thought...  I think I was 29, exactly.  What were you doing before that?  Don't ask.  Yeah, you don't want to know it.  Why are you asking questions, you mook?  Everything that didn't need an inventory. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  I got you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The authorities are in rowboats right now as we speak, looking for case.  He got the part of Rocky going down there making sure they was paying for the space.  You know, you can't come here and film a movie without him.  Yeah, hey.  You got a permit?  We sell him.  Change his name from Jerry DeLuise to Burt Young.  Is there a reason he did that?  Let's go to Jack in Jersey.  Is there a reason for that?  Jack, what's up?  Hey, Burt.  Hey, Burt.  How you doing?  Jack, hello.  Got an important question for you. 
[01:01:30]  What's the closest whorehouse to the Nectar Gallery?  What an ass.  What an ass.  I like that, though.  It's not necessarily a whorehouse near every art gallery.  All I can say is I'm staying at the W Hotel.  Just in case.  Why not, right?  Just in case any ladies want to say I'm Burt Young later tonight.  Burt, Rocky 7, right?  Is that what it is?  No.  It's Rocky 7, right?  Is that what it is?  It's Rocky Balboa.  It's called Rocky Balboa.  It's the seventh and the-  No, I think it's the sixth.  Is it the sixth?  Yeah.  Just in case any ladies want to say I'm Burt Young later tonight.  Burt, Rocky 7, right?  Is that what it is?  No.  It's Rocky Balboa. 
[01:02:00]  It's called Rocky Balboa.  It's the seventh and the-  No, I think it's the sixth.  Is it the sixth?  Yeah.  Just look at me.  I'm already putting another sequel on it.  Well, they said seven on our sheet, so we-  But that's kind of cool.  I like that it's not Rocky in the number.  It's Rocky Balboa.  That's his doing.  That was a very good idea, I think, because it kind of takes away-  It makes you think it's not just add another number on, same plot line and everything like that.  And it really is not.  And I got to tell you, from seeing that teaser, it definitely intrigued me because I think a lot of people have to be broken to the notion that this is just another installment of Rocky. 
[01:02:30]  It looks good?  Yeah, it does.  The first movie was, I at times had to help convince producers during it that it was a love story.  The fighting was important, but it was about standing up.  Not even winning, just standing.  And the woman, man, whomever, just standing.  This has gone back to that.  Mm-hmm.  Standing. 
[01:03:00]  And that's all the hell it is.  Yeah.  It's a plain man that threw the mill like we'd go, in and out, as long as we were around.  To end up on your feet, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  All right.  That sounds great.  Very good.  Don't need no has-been missing in my corner.  Hey, Creed.  Hey, Creed.  I love it, man.  Bert Young.  Hey, woman.  Yeah, let's thank Bert Young for stopping by today.  It's the Jade Nectar Gallery tonight, starting at 6 o'clock down on Cooper Street, right? 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  And again, I never take pictures with probably 1% of the people that come in there.  I would be honored if you would let me have a photo with you, sir.  What a pleasure.  Thank you.  If you'd call me off in front of the fans, that would have been great.  Oh, no, no.  I'm too busy. 
[01:04:00]  At this time, we have no comment.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Saturday Night Radio.  Is that official?  No comment.  I cannot comment at this time.  I hate other people's kids.  We interviewed her on our show earlier this week.  Yes, we did.  And now she's on the Today Show.  On the Today Show.  Look at that.  Although that's not her.  No.  What happened?  But they did show the one we interviewed. 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  They showed her in some kind of nursery.  All right.  We're going to get the audio.  See how the interview went with her and see how it differed with NBC, Today Show, and  us.  Well, as you said, I bet you Matt Lauer's not going to be talking about her empty uterus.  Oh, so.  Maybe.  Okay.  I hear that you can't have kids.  And so you have no uterus.  None.  Can I move in?  Can I move into your empty lot of room?  Let's talk about how many Twinkies you've eaten.  No fat jokes and no empty uterus jokes.  I was eating a pussy. 
[01:05:00]  From Matt Lauer.  I said, geez, you've got a big pussy.  Geez, you've got a big pussy.  She said, why'd you say it twice?  I didn't.  I didn't.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww. 
[01:05:30]  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  That's funny, hey woman, you got no uterus woman?  Well, they want to take another video game away from us.  Yeah.  They try this old gag every one, what, month or two?  Yeah, it's usually a violent video game, maybe gangsters against the cops kinda thing  or just random running around the streets and killing people like,  Grand Theft Auto series, which we love.  I haven't heard it. Can I guess before you tell it? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, sure. Try to guess.  What platform?  I honestly don't know.  I think PC and Xbox.  Is it an Xbox game?  I'm pretty sure.  Go ahead, Patrice. Guess.  Guess what the theme of this is  that is upsetting politicians that they want  this taken off  or regulated or something.  Tom Clancy's Rape Patrol.  That's a good one.  The theme of that one.  Tom Clancy's 
[01:06:30]  beg for your life, bitch.  I don't know.  Who fucking knows?  I thought it was this one called Bullets  or Black or something.  Black is out, yeah.  Black is getting a lot of heat.  Just because it's violent.  A lot of violence. A lot of fucking shooting in that game.  The game is called Text Messaging  Chinese Girl.  Uh-huh.  Find the Chinese girl.  That girl was adorable. 
[01:07:00]  She's all right, though, right?  Apparently, she's fine.  It was a Hulk.  You can't speculate.  You have to do a disclaimer.  Apparently.  Well, what happened was this girl,  this girl, she's, how old was she?  13.  13 years old.  I knew she was fine, by the way.  Of course.  I had no doubt in my mind this one was going to be okay.  You knew this wasn't a legitimate kidnapping.  When the kids get kidnapped, they disappear.  A certain amount of time goes by.  They're found dead or some weird circumstance.  They're found alive.  And the kid might be able to get one text message in  before the killer discovers the cell phone and gets rid of it. 
[01:07:30]  This girl is text messaging every five minutes.  Texting all the time.  No phone calls.  A charger.  No phone calls.  Yeah, she charges up a battery.  My battery's dying.  I've got to recharge.  Right.  Get back to you soon.  And then, you know, the fucking wink sign or whatever.  Dear Mom, could you buy more minutes?  I've used up all of my minutes.  Yeah, well, the story goes, girls, text her a big lie.  A big lie.  Frightening text messages sent by a 13-year-old New Jersey girl  who claimed she was kidnapped and being held captive 
[01:08:00]  were probably a cruel hoax, cops said yesterday.  Okay, Natasha Brown, who sent the messages to her terrified mother in Jersey City,  turned up unharmed on a Brooklyn street at around 1 a.m.  There you go.  That's a miracle in itself right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Unharmed, Brooklyn, 1 a.m.  Hello.  Initially, Natasha told NYPD detectives a harrowing tale  of being abducted on her way to school on Monday.  And there's nothing a 13-year-old can say to the cops  as far as a made-up lie story that the cops are ever going to believe. 
[01:08:30]  There's never been a 13-year-old lying to the cops  where the cops go, okay, well, case closed.  They always know that story comes apart so easily.  Now, where were you walking?  Yeah.  I was walking to school.  And what did they put you in?  They put a big sack over my head.  It was a guy.  He had a big curly mustache and he's very evil looking.  And he put me on the back of a bicycle with a big wheel in the front.  With a big wheel in the front.  And all he would say is, 
[01:09:00]  Nuh-uh-uh.  Nuh-uh-uh.  As he twirled his mustache between his thumb and forefinger.  And he called me Penelope Pitstop.  He tied me to the train tracks  and would let me go until I said I'd marry him.  So.  Nuh-uh-uh.  What was Penelope Pitstop?  What was that guy?  Paul Linn.  Snidely Whiplash?  It was Paul Linn.  It was Paul Linn playing the part.  Get me some cocker, you're dead. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  Circle gets the square, faggot.  Okay, Penelope.  Oh.  So.  Initially, Natasha told NYPD detectives a harrowing tale of being abducted on her way to school  on Monday, held in a pitch black basement, and later whisked to New York where two men  raped her.  But that story began to unravel quickly.  If it turns out to be a total hoax, quite frankly, I feel sorry for her and her parents 
[01:10:00]  at Jersey City Police Chief Robert Troy.  Apparently, the girl needed a little more attention than she was getting at home.  No.  And decided that she was going to go out and make believe she was abducted and send these  text messages.  Nope.  She's 13.  Yeah.  They start early.  They.  Who do you mean they?  The kids start early.  I believe that she just went off and her mom's told her, hey, you know, if she's an Asian  girl?  She looks Puerto Rican or something.  She looks mixed Asian and Puerto Rican. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, she's half Asian.  Which, by the way, is a pretty good mix.  Delicious.  Asian.  Delicious.  Right now, Asian and anything mixed is an amazing.  Asian.  As long as you mix it, though, you know.  Yeah, mix Asian with something.  You can't drink that stuff straight.  A little too much.  You gotta.  Straight Asian.  That shit will fuck up your liver.  You gotta get a little mixer in there, man.  You gotta mix it.  What can I get you?  I think she just went off and got a little something.  Or, you know, she just wanted to be with her little boyfriend so bad. 
[01:11:00]  You think that's it?  She's probably a little older.  Her boyfriend's probably 15.  Yeah.  You know, and she just wanted to be with her so bad.  Romeo and Juliet shit.  Yeah.  And, you know.  She ran off.  But the text message thing really riled the people up.  She might be just like, you know, a spoiled brat that's just getting back at her mom, too.  I doubt it.  That's a great way to get back.  I'm serious, because one of the-  Because some of the texts she-  Yeah, one of the text messages read,  Please help mom.  He's making me do disgusting stuff.  Why would you do that to your own mom?  Because it's hot.  What a text message. 
[01:11:30]  So they're not really buying it right now.  They're making me do disgusting things.  What do they make you do?  Lick this urinal cake.  Do it.  Here's another-  Can you imagine being a mom?  Lick the urinal cake!  Oh my God.  You don't think that's disgusting, Patrice?  Of course it is.  Lick the urinal cake.  We got a feel for a mom a little bit, because another message read,  Help, I'm scared.  I don't know where I am.  Can you imagine being a parent, and you're getting this shit from your kid?  You put, knock it off, and get your ass home. 
[01:12:00]  She didn't know what drive-in theater she was in.  Here we go.  Here we go.  This is where-  She found a drive-in theater, the last drive-in theater.  It was a drive-in.  Investigators said the girl met a man about three or four weeks ago at a Jersey City shopping mall  and agreed to stay in touch with him by text messaging.  Ah, text or MySpace.  On Monday, she played hooky from school to meet him at a mall, but the two-part accompany later in the day.  There you go.  So it's all about this guy, whoever it is.  This guy.  How old is he, and how big trouble is he in?  They're not saying that. 
[01:12:30]  At the mall.  He's in trouble.  Bought her some little panties.  Bought her a little fucking diary with a gold binder and a key.  Nice.  Let's go to James in Pennsylvania.  James.  You write everything down.  Everyone have little secrets.  James.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  The guy's name was Dastardly, and his dog's name was Muttley.  Dastardly and Muttley was Penelope Pitstop?  Yeah.  Which was Snidely Whiplash?  He was the one from-  No, that's Rocky and Bullwinkle.  No, no.  Snidely Whiplash was the one from-  Dudley Durite.  Dudley Durite. 
[01:13:00]  There you go.  That was at the Canadian fucking-  Snidely Whiplash, but-  Canadian Mountie.  There you go.  But the claw was Penelope Pitstop.  Hmm.  You sure Penelope Pitstop?  Yeah, because that was in the-  That was the claw.  The evil claw.  The evil claw.  The evil claw.  Oh, shit.  I hung up on your back in there, bro.  Yeah, Penelope Pitstop was one with the crazy races where they'd all have their cars and  they're racing, and she was Penelope Pitstop.  The something gang, there's something-  Yeah, it was like an ensemble cast of cartoons.  Pete and Buffalo. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Still snowing up there, bro?  Love you.  Listen, yeah, when I was 14, my cousin, who's the same age as me, she was kidnapped, too.  And not real kidnapped, of course, she made the whole thing up.  I mean, it's like this weird cry for help thing.  And, you know, you were saying, like, oh, the cops won't believe in it.  But it's not about, like, they don't think that way.  It's, you know, they want to convince the parents, or, like, she'd just broken up with  her little 14-year-old boyfriend at the time, and she wanted to get back. 
[01:14:00]  So, you know, she said that these four black guys grabbed her.  Of course.  Oh, boy.  Of course.  Threw her in a car, and, of course, she didn't remember what they looked like.  It's always over the top, too, like that.  Like, when does that ever happen?  Like, the cops would be like, you know, four, okay, so four black guys grabbed this little  14-year-old white girl.  Throw her in a van.  You got to give credit to the cops at this point.  They're on to that gag.  Oh, please.  They got to be on to that gag.  She actually took a knife and, like, cut herself, like, on her collarbone and said they were 
[01:14:30]  holding a knife to her throat, but it was, like, on her.  She's like, on her.  It was so bizarre.  Well, on the other hand, it happened the other way around with Tawana Brawley, where she  was blaming cops and politicians for throwing her in a bag.  Oh, that happened to her.  Where she, uh, uh, what was, uh, there was, uh, uh, what was scraped into her?  I think they put nigger on her chest and spread some cops some shit on her.  Shut up, Patrice.  Fucking assholes.  Even you don't believe that shit.  And she blamed it on the cops and some politician.  And they shoved a plunger in the ass or something, right? 
[01:15:00]  And shoved a plunger and then shot her 36 times or something, 41 times.  And, uh, but, but she had, you know, two lawyers and, uh, Reverend Al behind her the whole  way.  Even when the story fell apart, there was still, we gotta remember Tawana Brawley.  Hey, can I, can I challenge white society on something right now?  That's what I want you to do.  It just, it just popped in my head.  Oh, boy.  Conspiracy theory.  Ready?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Please.  Another conspiracy theory from a black man.  Can white people please name me more than one black counterpart to your fucked upness? 
[01:15:30]  Well, all right.  Can you?  All right.  It makes a good point.  The 85 fucking white examples of murdering your wife, can you name me a second Negro other  than OJ, please?  Well.  Or a second fake rape black girl other than Tawana Brawley.  Can you fucking please just once say other than the, the one fucking thing? 
[01:16:00]  Do I have to bring up poor Reginald Denny who got the brick over the head?  Are you joking?  That's the only, that's the only time you've seen a, a, a, a, a, a white guy get his ass  beat.  You know why, Patrice?  Because it's like pointing out the sky's blue.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Do I have to say anything?  Let me just open the goddamn newspaper and look at a black guy that wrapped the girl's head  up in tape here in, uh, in, uh, New York.  That's, that's alleged, man.  That's alleged.  That is not.  That is, that they found fibers of his carpeting in his house on the tape that was wrapped around 
[01:16:30]  her head.  Motherfucker, I got the same.  CSI shit, motherfucker.  CSI is on.  Nigga, I bought a carpet.  CSI is on, brother.  The carpet in my house, I brought from a nigga that hangs over a fucking, uh, a, a fence  on Route 440.  You don't think another person has that?  That doesn't matter.  CSI, colored shenanigans investigators.  That's what they look into.  Carpet fibers on tape.  Uh, it's called cunt scene investigation. 
[01:17:00]  Come on, man.  It's, uh, taking place and, uh, we can bring out something that happened yesterday with  white people and you got to go dig back into the, into the nigga files to find the nigga.  Now that's a show I'd watch every Wednesday night.  What about Sidney Poitier, where he was, what?  You know, Martin Luther King was quite a womanizer.  Oh my God.  There's always gotta be something.  I, I, I agree with you.  I implore you just to find, I implore you.  Find a pattern that, some black guy, some black guy's found missing on a boat. 
[01:17:30]  You just find.  Ours are high profile.  You, you guys, the high profile ones are a little limited, but on a daily basis, there's  the, you know, the B movies.  I forgot.  We got the B movies either in the, either in the daily or the post.  Okay.  There's a little picture of a, um, little black girl.  Yeah.  Right.  Just to, uh, and, and again, you know, not to get fucking 50 million people hating your  guts, but this, this Mehmet and the, the, um, the girl from Aruba.  Uh huh.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the name?  Who disappeared in Aruba?  Uh, some girl, but little caption of a little dead black girl, you know, murdered,  nothing.  Just maybe almost under where, where it says daily news.com on the front page, uh, black  girl missing.  It's like, you, how can you help but think that if you're black, it's like, Oh my God.  I remember front cover of everything for the last, the girl in Aruba was taking headlines  from Iraq and, and, and there's, there's people missing everywhere, but they make decisions. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, if be honest with me, just be honest, I'll be honest, be honest and say, okay, you  know what?  We just find white life to be a little more important than black life.  And I might go, okay, fair enough.  At least that's the truth.  Motherfucker.  But I pointed out, it's not racist.  I pointed out the fact that there are plenty of missing kids, but for some reason it's the,  the little blonde girls that like get a lot of the attention, uh, when they're missing  and it's just on the news ad nauseum and then a little black girl's missing, they flash 
[01:19:00]  a picture on a goddamn milk carton somewhere.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And I, you know something?  Uh, I think that's, uh, do I think that's racist?  Um, I don't know.  I think it has to do, I don't know.  I'm, I'm, I'm being honest here.  I don't know if it's so much racist or just the fact that humans, I don't think it's racist.  I think for whatever reason it makes it a better story and that's why they go with it.  That white girl is missing?  Why does that make it a better story?  Uh, for the people that are watching, I guess. 
[01:19:30]  But that's racist.  Well, just say that.  That would be racist.  Just say in this society, just be honest, that in this society they value a little white  girl's life more than they value a little black girl's life.  Like, just fucking say it and it'd be fine.  No, no, because here, here's the deal.  People value their own more than others.  And I mean black, Arab, anything.  Every fucking day.  Every day I listen to the news and I hear a bomb went off in Baghdad, 50 people were  dead.  Honest with you.  I'll be honest with you.  I could give a flying fuck. 
[01:20:00]  I don't care.  They show the dead bodies, fine.  I hear on the news, a roadside bomb blew up, two marines were killed.  Now I go, son of a bitch.  That's weird.  Two more fucking marines got killed.  Those sons of bitch insurgents got, it's, it's more our own.  And since blacks make up 10% of the population, there's 10% of people that are very concerned  about that black girl.  90% are going, it ain't us.  It ain't fucking us.  I would love to think.  I can deal with what you're saying.  See, that's what I'm saying.  This is what bothers me about this country. 
[01:20:30]  I don't think it's racist as much as it is animalistic.  But what you're saying.  The tiger don't care that a gazelle is laying there fucking bleeding.  And that's, and that's what I mean by, it just makes for an interesting story, by the  way.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's racist.  It makes for an interesting story to 90% of the population.  That's what, that's what I'm saying.  Or whatever white he is.  Now, if the news said that, I'd be happy about that.  They'd never say that.  If the news, like, what is her name from a rule by, Natalie Halloway.  Natalie Halloway.  Okay, sorry.  God damn, Natalie Halloway.  You're trying to look it up.  From the Connecticut Halloways.  But, but that, during that whole stretch, the news was starting to feel the pressure. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  So they go, oh, also there's a little nigglet in Philly missing.  Sorry about that.  Did they put it that way?  We found, there's a nigglet missing, also.  No, we found a nigglet.  They didn't report it like that.  The black killers, they ain't as good as white killers.  No, no one.  They don't have crab baskets.  No, it was one of my favorite black, white stories on the news.  They had a lady that was the oldest woman to give birth.  Right.  And she was in her 60s or something, and she was white, right? 
[01:21:30]  And she gave birth to this kid.  Everything was great.  They're doing stories every freaking day, right?  The next week, I think it was, a black lady beat the record.  She got, like, nothing.  And called up, and said she was a crack hole.  Right.  She got nothing.  Some old black crack hole gave birth.  Ah, who cares?  They can't stop fucking.  But it was, here we go.  Well, fam.  But it's funny.  The media brought us all in, like, this is very interesting.  This is unbelievable.  This has never been done before.  Blah, blah, blah.  It's a brand new record. 
[01:22:00]  And then the following week, a black lady beats the record.  It was like, it was the last story on the news, maybe, for 10 seconds.  No exclusive interviews or anything with her.  I'm saying.  What do you say that is?  Is that, is that not, I don't know if it's racism myself.  Like, just like I said to a lot of people, man, I'm not positively.  My first instinct is to always try to accuse white people of racism.  Yeah.  But I always try to find a way to say maybe it's not.  But it's like, can you give me a reason why that's not racist? 
[01:22:30]  I would love to say.  Or not valuing white people more.  I'd love to say, yeah, that's just racism.  But it's not that simple.  We like to think of ourselves.  People love to think we're above animals.  We're not.  Until we bash that into our fucking heads, we're never going to.  Move on.  We are just another organism on this planet that we're a little smarter.  We figured out how to pull shit out of the dirt and make iron out of it.  We can fly in fucking machines. 
[01:23:00]  It's a wonderful thing.  But we're still animals.  And we look at things based on our familiarity with each other, with our things.  We are going to be more comfortable and feel more apathy towards something that is more like us than something that is less like us.  And that's what the animal world does.  Animals don't do that.  Yeah, they do.  The other gazelles don't go, that's some fucked up shit.  What happened to Frank when the lion got his face to it?  Look at the fucking penguin movie. 
[01:23:30]  They're looking at the dead little penguin baby going, meh, meh.  They're crying.  They're not looking at the dead bird going, meh, meh.  They could give a shit about the dead bird.  They care about their little penguin babies.  We care about each other.  Do you think that black people gave any bit of a shit about JonBenet Ramsey in that whole case?  Yeah, that's a bad example.  They didn't care about her.  She's a privileged little white girl.  Because we know about it.  You knew about it.  We do know about it.  But was there this big outrage of people going, well, they got to find out that the parents are doing it? 
[01:24:00]  You know what, that JonBenet Ramsey situation is almost as big as OJ.  It's huge, right.  And people do care about that girl.  That might have transcended it.  The little girl in Florida with the pink little Kangol hat.  I'm going to tell you who black people fell for.  Who?  That girl that just got on at the car wash.  You fell for that girl.  Oh, man, that was a bad one.  Watching that girl into that girl's life, you fucking go, oh, my God.  Be hauled away by that monster.  I'm not saying.  Yeah, but that goes to a whole other level because there's actual video going, oh, my God. 
[01:24:30]  If that was a black girl.  This is human life, and this is the last maybe hour of her human life on TV.  You see the last clip of her life.  If that was a black girl being hauled away like that, I think you'd have seen a lot more.  You'd have seen the same coverage like that.  I really do think that because it was so sensational that you saw the last portion of her life there.  I think that goes to a whole other level.  And then we almost transcended that thing to, well, she's human, we're human.  So I can then feel some sympathy towards that. 
[01:25:00]  Let me be fair, and let me clear up what the problem is.  The problem is not that Mehmet or Natalie Holloway, they're dead.  And going to OJ, it's not that OJ didn't kill his wife, and it's not that you don't feel bad for that whole situation.  It's the fact that, wait a minute, how are you prioritizing that woman's life to the life of some lady?  If you're going to prioritize life, prioritize all life. 
[01:25:30]  And these children, I'm not saying, oh, a black girl got killed, fuck the white girl.  I'm saying, well, the black girl got killed too.  Can we at least have as much concern for her life as opposed to, you know, you get, there's no way that a little girl should get killed.  And you, in being in the news so much that you get tired, you go, what the fuck, does this bitch have gold inside?  Is this bitch, no, with black beard, does she have government secrets? 
[01:26:00]  Like, you shouldn't get tired of hearing about a dead girl, where you go, oh, enough of that dead girl, enough.  Like, now the parents are, it's like they're trying to, you know, take this thing to court, you know, in New York.  And you're like, enough already, brother man, Shuston, move on.  It's because, like, there's other people dead.  There's other people getting killed.  There's other people dying.  Just say, you know.  You're right.  You're right, but look at the way the news works. 
[01:26:30]  And the only place we really hear about it is the news.  Where else are you going to hear about it, your friend?  Right.  So you hear about it on the news.  The news, admittedly, a business looking to bring in the most people possible.  What story is going to get them more ratings?  If they said that.  And it does look racist.  If they said that, I think that the country would be happier if they go, tonight in news, little white girl's missing because more people will probably be concerned.  Tune in.  About this.  And then we can tell our advertisers that more people are going to tune in for the white girl's story. 
[01:27:00]  More affluent people are going to tune in for the white girl's story.  So that's what we're doing.  It's more about money than it is racism.  Demographics.  If they said that, then they could be, we could be happy.  If they said that, there'd be a fucking revolution.  No, it wouldn't because it's already a revolution of people going, what the fuck?  What, where's, where's the missing black people already?  Like, you just want a little honesty.  It keeps people divided because we're like, okay, going back to American Idol. 
[01:27:30]  I'm saying this country's not voting for a black sissy as their idol.  Now, you go, no, I don't think so.  But if America goes, you know, when I voted, I just didn't like it.  He was an arrogant black sissy.  I like the little boy.  You know what?  I can't battle honesty.  I can battle fucking dishonesty.  Not dishonesty, but what's the, but that's the, that's the beauty of this whole thing.  You're never going to get honesty from your media.  Never.  Even from the average white person? 
[01:28:00]  Never.  Yeah.  No, you won't.  You're not going to get honesty.  Just the average white person say the fucking truth.  White people are very scared, to be honest, with black people.  They make me sick with that fake bullshit.  With, uh, uh, with black people.  Did I mention black people?  We're very scared of black people.  Why are you so mad at OJ?  Is it because a black man killed a white woman and got away with it?  No, it has nothing to do with race.  Nothing.  People are very, they walk on eggshells.  White people, on the whole, walk on eggshells when dealing with black issues, black subject 
[01:28:30]  matter, black people.  It's an eggshell thing.  And a lot of black people are blamed for that, for putting Whitey in that position.  We don't.  The race war is between liberals and conservatives.  Black people are like, hello, um, we're the issue here.  And you got liberals and conservatives arguing about how to fucking treat niggas.  I'm in the room.  I'm in the room.  Listen, let's get some phone calls in because they're going nuts out there. 
[01:29:00]  Jane in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Make it fast.  Hey guys, I just wanted to say, I have to agree with Anthony in that I think the media  plays on what we want to hear, what we want to see.  Um, if it was a black girl that was disappearing from a school trip in Aruba, I think it'd be  all over the place.  But, you know, I think the reality is that kids disappear every day in that.  You think that was showing as much coverage?  I don't think, no, no, I don't think a black girl disappearing in Aruba would have gotten  as much coverage as a blonde white girl.  Not even a fucking drop.  I don't think so. 
[01:29:30]  A black American girl?  Nope.  No.  No way.  Don't think so.  No way.  Nope.  Nope.  I gotta be honest with you.  I don't, I wouldn't see that happening.  But I don't see that as being completely racist.  You could see it as racist by association, but I see it more as a business decision, as  a demographic decision by the news than it is going, we don't care about this person  really, uh, so let's just not address the issue.  I think that's the media making that call.  Yeah.  Not humans.  I'm not saying, see, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that the human factor, if it was a little black girl and they showed 
[01:30:00]  her, her last seconds.  Right.  I felt that, that, I felt for that girl.  Uh-huh.  You, you, you, your heart goes out to that girl.  You're not, you're not sad.  No matter what the fuck she was.  No matter who she was.  You're not human if you don't feel in that moment.  I'm saying, the point is, if it was a little black girl in Aruba, just, just give  it the same, she's missing.  It ain't gonna happen anytime soon.  And if, and if it doesn't, just say, here's why it ain't gonna happen, big shot. 
[01:30:30]  Even with Natalie Halloway, they were probably wishing she was even hotter.  Yeah.  Cause she was kind of skanky nigga.  Man, she's like a seven, but we can run with that.  If you want to see missing niggas, read the Amsterdam news, motherfucker.  Amsterdam news.  You go to 125th Street and get a free copy of something.  Listen.  Here, look in the back of the daily challenge.  They don't give a fuck.  Read Al Shopton's blog if you want to hear about missing nigglets.  Let's go to George in New York City.  George.  Yo.  Hey. 
[01:31:00]  Just wanted to correct Anthony on something.  Okay.  They put little black girls on the back of a chocolate milk carton.  Oh, you.  All right.  Hey, guys.  It's been 20 minutes.  We need a joke, man.  We need a joke.  Oh, my God.  Somebody should really put a silencer on this motherfucker.  That's another old-ass joke.  That's an old, he was, couldn't wait to say that.  Just a faceless motherfucker.  Punch it out.  That was, probably works with somebody black.  He just said that.  That joke was handed to me when I was in my crib.  Yeah.  Come on. 
[01:31:30]  You're going to need this one someday.  He could have just beamed that mentally to you.  Let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Yo.  Yeah, you're on, man.  Come on, man.  We're on a good roll.  What's up?  It's an honor, bro.  It's an honor.  Cool.  Not for us.  The media is so afraid of betraying a black guy as, like, the bad guy.  Are they really?  Let's look at the front cover of the fucking Daily News today with.  Well, that guy is a bad guy.  With Mr. Nigger Who Ain't Did Shit Yet on the front cover.  All over the spectrum, bro.  He did it.  Let's be honest.  The guy did it. 
[01:32:00]  Let's relax.  The guy did it.  I will say there are white guy crimes.  I will be fair.  Pedophilia is exclusive to you, motherfucker.  Black guy crime.  White guy crime.  When a black person is a victim, it's always another black person that fucked them up.  That's why they're not on the news.  Not in the news.  Now, okay, when a black person is a victim, he's only a victim when a white guy does something  fucked up.  Absolutely.  I will be fair.  Other times, I've thumbed through the paper, gotten to page 27, a little column.  You hear about some cookout going out in the backyard somewhere in Brooklyn, and there's 
[01:32:30]  three dead in a shooting, and you know it was just a bunch of black guys with a problem  with each other.  Just doing what they do.  I'm just trying to cookout, and the motherfuckers are shooting shit, and you know, because it  was on page 28.  I will be fair.  That race, it is a ploy to sell.  I understand that shit, but say it.  There won't be a revolution.  That kind of honesty would be great.  If you come out, just like we were talking about Coke, what could you say to honesty? 
[01:33:00]  You know what, it just, we found that when we put on black people missing, here's what  people want to hear about black people.  We want to, we've done research.  We want to hear rap stories.  Good.  Stories about rappers.  I'm tuned in.  Rappers getting arrested.  I'm right there.  We've shown that people aren't really interested in missing black children.  No one.  They love missing white children. 
[01:33:30]  They love white children in some sort of danger that may not, or may or may not have  happened.  Black criminals, we are interested in rapists, black rapists, because that's a visceral fear  of white people.  The scariest thing on the planet, by the way.  And we would love black pedophiles, but there's not any that we can find.  There's a black guy, I'm sure somebody will go, remember that nigga in Atlanta in 61?  That guy's always brought up.  You fucking asshole.  Whenever serial killers are brought up, or, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Charles something, right?  Uh-oh.  Remember?  Remember that nigga in Atlanta?  Oh, really?  Remember the 47 white boys last week?  Look at you and your stereotyping.  That is so true, though.  Sons of bitches, man.  We got them all up.  Let me tell you something.  You've got to accept that half of it with a little weight on your side.  There are, those serial killers, older white guy or middle-aged white guy with some sexual  problem with his mom is going to go out and kill hookers and kids and pedophiles are going 
[01:34:30]  to be the creepy fucking glasses-wearing teacher, squeezing little girl asses, white guy, but  there are certain crimes that are just for you black guys.  Not always exclusively.  I'm sure you could pull up another Atlanta thing like that, but.  But that's the one you want to, you want, they want to see this.  This guy.  This, this, uh, uh, uh, uh, Daryl Littlejohn.  Because it's a white girl.  Because it's a white girl.  So that really taps in to the thing that we're trying to get out of. 
[01:35:00]  It's a monster movie.  Oh my God.  Oh, big.  I can imagine his eyes bugging out.  He was sweating.  You play it out in your head.  The horror that she was living through.  And that's what they want.  I agree with you, Opie, on that shit.  But I'm saying, fucking just be honest with the motherfucker.  That's where you're just silly.  You're not going to get honest.  That type of honesty doesn't happen on the planet honest.  It never would happen.  Impossibility.  On Liar Liarville. 
[01:35:30]  It wouldn't happen.  Never.  It's just not happening.  All right.  You know what?  This moves into a great discussion.  Have you seen the new show Black White on FX?  I haven't seen it.  This is a very interesting concept.  They're taking a white guy, making him black.  A whole family.  A whole family, actually.  It's a white father, white mother, white daughter.  And then there's another family, black father, black mother, black son.  And they, through makeup, make the black family white, white family black, send them out, see how they can assimilate to their various race. 
[01:36:00]  See how the other half lives.  And the problems that they have and see how the other half lives.  And you know who's going to have the epiphany at the end?  The white family.  The white family.  Oh, my God.  I didn't realize how hard it was to walk around as a black person.  Apparently, makeup-wise, I'm hearing the white daughter as the black girl was the best looking.  Like, they kind of made her up where it was kind of passable that she could be black. 
[01:36:30]  She was kind of cute.  But there's pure comedy in this show, though, man.  The black kid, dressed as a white kid, didn't want to play role play.  So he just looked like a white kid, kind of weird, though, but was all acting ghetto.  Like, he didn't want to really commit to the role.  Which is not that crazy now.  No, no.  That's perfectly acceptable.  Perfectly into the whole thing.  They call them wiggers.  The white kid kind of looks...  He reminds me of, like, when Eddie Murphy used to play a white person. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  He looks at over-the-top makeup.  Yeah, like white chicks.  Yeah, exactly.  So we got a few clips from the show.  The first one is white guy will pick up their walk.  So it's...  He's just...  This is like when they're first starting, and he's excited about certain things.  Oh, so this is an actual white guy before they turn him into the black guy.  Yeah.  They take two families and...  Yeah.  No, explain that.  But, all right.  So, when you say white guy in this clip, it's an actual...  It's the white guy.  It's the white guy before he becomes black. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  And he's getting excited about the whole process, I guess.  Yeah.  My name is Bruno, and during this project, I'm going to become a black person along with  my family.  My name is Rose.  I'm 17 years old, and I'm a white girl.  I know.  It's just so exciting to be a part of this project.  Oh.  I don't know what to expect.  I'll pick up some other affectations and characteristics and maybe end up walking a little differently.  He's going to come out with the Antonio Vargas pimp from the 70s huggy bear walk. 
[01:38:00]  With the hand turned backwards.  Yo, where the bitch is at?  Oh, yeah, baby.  That's literally how he was walking, though.  He was trying to...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it's a subtle thing.  And he starts, like, shucking and jiving down the...  Oh, my God.  White people think we all walk like, uh, uh, uh, what is it?  Well, Mick Jagger and George Jefferson mix.  We kick, we kick when we walk, and somebody will get poked in the eye because our hands 
[01:38:30]  are always moving.  Fuck it.  White people are just unbelievable, man.  Oh, and you guys are just terrific.  Just un-fucking-believable.  You guys are just terrific.  At least we know who...  You know what I mean?  At least we know what our problems are and what our strengths...  White people are so fucking delusional about everything.  If I was to do a white guy walk, I would truly try to do...  I wouldn't just tighten my butt.  Well, that's the black comic.  It's the black hack comic version of the white guy. 
[01:39:00]  It's a hack person.  Well, look at me going off to work today, and they do that voice and kind of tighten  up their walk.  Oh, you know what?  There's a good point from Miller in Dallas, by the way, backing up slightly.  Miller, go ahead.  Well, there's a reason why there's no black pedophiles.  Niggers don't know how to use computers yet.  Well, I didn't think you were going to go with the end one.  Oh, Jesus Christ, buddy.  It's weird how certain people know how to be racist and it's fun.  You can just hear...  He has that painting on his wall.  He has a stencil.  He has a nigger stencil. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  That is a perfect example of what happened.  Remember when Bill Burr had his big awakening about the program?  It was last year's St. Paddy's Day party we had at the Hard Rock.  And Bill Burr sits down.  And we talk about race a lot.  It's an issue.  And we try to have fun with it.  We try to be honest with it, give our honest opinions, but keep it light and fun.  And we were doing that.  And then the audience was coming up with racist jokes. 
[01:40:00]  And it was so brutal, so mean-spirited that Bill just went, oh, my God, what am I sitting  in?  Like he went from this fun conversation thing to a Klan meeting in a matter of minutes.  He was looking for a back door.  And this guy right here, he actually stumbled a little bit, but he had to make sure he said  nigger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because, um, because, um, I'm sorry.  Niggers!  Don't want to miss that!  But it's like, it's like you go, fuck, did you really come out?  Yeah.  Motherfucker, it's like you can, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  We gotta, we gotta move on, because there's too much good stuff here still.  So blacks are superior athletes.  This is the Bruno guy talking, the white guy.  The white guy?  Yeah.  So this is his-  The Greek?  Yeah.  This is his thoughts on black people before he turns himself black.  For the show.  Uh, being a former basketball player, I always thought how nice it would be to be able to  jump, get off the ground, leap, and slam dunk like these guys can.  And there's no doubt about it.  Like these guys.  Uh, blacks are superior.  You know, physically, uh, and down.  They're faster, they leap higher, they're just awesome.  I like this guy. 
[01:41:00]  That got Jimmy the Greek fired.  Yeah.  When he said that on television, it got him fired.  Not really, that didn't get him fired.  The black athlete.  Well, it was from the Civil War days when they bred their big black buck with the black  woman, with their black woman, and it made the better athlete.  That's why he got fired.  Yeah, that might have been a little-  Telling the whole story.  You know, he got a little more detail.  We actually got the clip.  Here it is.  The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way. 
[01:41:30]  Because of his high thighs and big thighs, it goes up into his back.  And they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs.  This goes back all the way to the Civil War, when during the slave trading, the big, the  owner, the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have  a big, a big, a big, a big black kid.  You're fired!  You're fired!  Holy shit. 
[01:42:00]  Just having his cannoli and telling the truth.  Look what happens.  This goes back to the Civil War days.  His high, his high, his high thighs going into his high butt.  The high back.  You know, there ain't all that hair, the nappy hair don't get in their eyes when they're  shooting the baskets.  And that'll help also with the athlete.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  The big schlong kind of counterbalances like a T-Rex's tail.  Yeah, you know what that did? 
[01:42:30]  So they got the better balance.  You guys have no problem with that stereotype, by the way.  We have no problem with the big cock style.  That's what it is.  We do when it's fucking dehumanizing.  Here we go.  Let's go to the third clip.  Black guy goes shoe shopping.  As a white guy.  So.  The black guy is now in white face and is going shoe shopping.  All right.  So this is a black guy who is now.  You buy some big pimp platform shoes and give away his goldfish in a heel.  Goldfish in a heel.  See, this is where it's confusing for radio. 
[01:43:00]  This is a black guy that is now white for the show.  Yeah.  Going shoe shopping.  Okay.  I needed a pair of shoes.  So I went shopping.  As a white guy, I'm relaxed when I'm shopping.  I put on my white makeup and I'm having fun.  How can I answer your questions for you?  I like these two here.  Okay.  I kind of like that one better.  What size do you work?  Uh, 11.  Black.  And then the most amazing thing happened.  The guy actually took my foot and put it in the shoe and put a shoe horn in the back to make sure my foot slide in. 
[01:43:30]  That feels good.  That feels good.  This kind of shoe should be pretty comfortable right from the start.  Listen to the music.  I have never in my life had someone, you know, they come out and give me my shoe, but I've never had anyone actually unlace it, open it, shoehorn the back, and slide my foot into the shoe.  Is this what the white guys get?  Is this all the benefits they get?  It's never happened to me black in 40 years.  The first time I go and buy shoes is white.  I have it done.  I was like, wow, the possibilities are endless.  That's the white guy shopping music. 
[01:44:00]  This could be the greatest show ever.  Did the guy also find out that we don't have to pay for anything?  Let me tell you.  See, I hear you.  You didn't learn the handshake.  I hear you shitty little sarcasm when you said that, right?  Let me tell you something.  If I own a sneaker store, it would be called, ignore that cracker till you serve the black person.  You know why?  Here comes a fucking white guy.  This is not an exaggeration.  Here's a fucking old white man.  Hi, how are you?  Hello.  Can you show me the Air Max 1462, please? 
[01:44:30]  Okay, sure.  Go get the box.  I'm standing there, right?  Just waiting.  I'm coming out.  So what?  Um, white guys buy the shit shoes for what they're meant for.  This guy's, how's the instep?  How's this?  These laces?  Is it going to hurt my heel?  The cross trending.  And that motherfucker spends hours with this asshole who probably isn't going to buy it.  Or he's going to buy a cheaper pair of Asics. 
[01:45:00]  Here comes a little nigga.  Yo, give me, um, give me.  Your money?  My money?  Yeah.  Give me the motherfucking, give me the new Jordans.  Give me the new motherfucking LeBrons.  Yo, give me those new laces.  Give me two pairs of socks.  Give me those two hats that match them motherfuckers.  And give me that, you motherfuckers sell bandanas?  And give me the driving gloves.  You want to try them on?  No, nigga.  I know what size I am.  A ten and a half, motherfucker.  How much?  $562?  I'm out. 
[01:45:30]  Them motherfuckers will cater to a white man's needs at a sneaker store where they're useless.  White people don't shop.  He's not going to be a return customer.  He's going to buy it once.  It's going to be a hole in the tip of the shoe after two years and then he'll come back.  But black guys and black girls, young black guys, young black girls, will buy the sneakers  because they're new and because they fucking match the t-shirt that they bought yesterday.  How can you not get treated better when we're more valuable to Foot Locker than white people are? 
[01:46:00]  Very good question.  Very good question.  That I don't have an answer to.  We don't have an answer.  I do not have an answer to that, so I'm going to have to just opt and say it's racism.  Well, listen.  Anytime I don't have an answer, it's racism.  Speaking of racism, this next clip is great.  It's the white guy who's now going to be a black guy for the show.  Uh-huh.  What's the music?  And born a white guy.  He's going to be black for the show.  He can't wait to be called a nigger.  Wow. 
[01:46:30]  Can't wait.  Can't wait.  It'll be interesting, and I'm sure it'll happen, where I'll be in black and I'll get  some attitude from some prick white guy and I won't have all the history of resentment  that a black man has and I'll be able to f*** with him.  I'll just, you know, mentally spar with him and go, you know, he says, hey, nigger.  You know, I won't get angry.  I'll just kind of smile at myself and go, wow, why'd you say that?  Black people don't even get angry anymore. 
[01:47:00]  They don't get angry.  Somebody call me a nigger.  I laugh my ass off.  I'm like, ouch.  Oh, shit.  Did you get me?  You know what?  You own me now, motherfucker.  That hurt.  You own my mind.  That's a delusional motherfucker.  That's arrogance.  That's that hovering above motherfucker shit.  When do white people blurt that out to black people, by the way?  When does that happen to their face, I mean?  Other than this show, hardly ever.  Hardly ever does that happen.  When there's 50 more white people. 
[01:47:30]  I swear to God, I get enraged in traffic.  Everyone knows my road rage and stuff.  And racial epithets fly out of my mouth.  But it's 90% of it is Asians and Arabs.  Arabs now are, I will roll a window down.  I got in an argument with a cab driver a couple of weeks back.  This motherfucker, my lane was closing.  And I wasn't pulling.  I swear to you, I wasn't pulling one of these.  The lane's closing.  I'm going right up to where it closed and dart right in. 
[01:48:00]  I started merging over early doing the zipper thing, you know, where one car lets in, the next car lets the other.  And then my turn to come in.  This cab gets rocked.  And he left a space.  And as I start cutting over, he goes, boom, right up on the other guy's ass, wouldn't let me in.  I roll my window down.  I go, hey, hey.  He rolls his window down.  And I just let out, you fucking rag-headed cocksucker.  Get back to your terrorist fucking nation. 
[01:48:30]  I mean, racial epithet.  You fuck yourself, motherfucker.  Fuck yourself.  And for some reason, I felt fine doing that.  But if it was a black guy, I would have been pissed.  But never would I roll the window down and start with, hey, you nigga, motherfucker.  Well, it's all in context.  Never.  It's all in context because we're hardly ever the cause of roadway.  We're not known to be bad drivers.  Fat black women, some of the worst drivers I've ever seen out there.  Some of the worst.  You come up on a car doing 35 in the left lane, and there she is, uh-huh, I drive wherever the hell I want to drive, motherfucker. 
[01:49:00]  Fat black women, horrible drivers, but not to be surpassed.  The Asian in the spray-painted van, the van that's got the Chinese writing on it all over the – it's out in the neighborhood.  Worst drivers ever.  And they sit there, and they got the face on like, oh.  You've got to feel for the Asian.  I wish I could –  Hold on.  You've got to feel for the Asian van driver because you just nailed something.  You see these on the Long Island Railroad and stuff.  You know they're having a business in a black neighborhood, and they're just trying to get by and park this fucking thing. 
[01:49:30]  And they get up in the morning, and they got graffiti all over the fucking car.  It all trickles back down to us.  Where it's like, oh, you've got to feel for the Chinese.  They're dealing with the niggas, too.  How are the black guys spray-painting Chinese writing on – it's some Chinese gang.  Oh, you're saying it's Chinese graffiti.  It's Chinese graffiti.  I haven't seen the Chinese graffiti.  All over this van.  I just think it's hilarious because you see the Chinese guy.  He's never going to speak up in his life ever.  And there's his van.  It was brand new on Monday.  It's all graffitied out by Friday. 
[01:50:00]  I drive, and when I'm inconvenienced by someone on the road, I have to get around and look.  And every time I look, 99% of the times I look, I go – what comes out of my mouth?  Oh, figures.  Ah, figures.  They're awful.  You'll see an Asian guy with the face on, and I wish I could describe it, but the only  thing I could describe so you could hear it and see the face is he's looking kind of straight  ahead, almost looks like he's falling asleep, and I don't mean because his eyes are Asian. 
[01:50:30]  I mean just his whole face is dripping, and he's hunched over the wheel a little, and his  face looks like, oh, oh, and they never look at you.  They never know that they're not supposed to be there in the left lane.  That pisses me off more than anything.  The guy that has no clue he's not supposed to be there.  Get the fuck out of the way.  All right, listen.  Let's get to some more of these clips.  So now you've got the white woman talks about jiving.  I guess this white woman –  Jiving?  The white woman's going to be a black woman? 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  Okay, here we go.  You know, no one's going to just strictly come up and say, hey, nigger, or anything like  that, because that kind of racism is really not there today.  There you go.  We won't get the positions that we're qualified for, or we won't get the service that everybody  else get.  But honestly, I think that Rose and Carmen and Bruno is going to get a lot more out of this  than we will, because of the fact that white don't have to go through the day-to-day small  things that you never think about.  Like, if I go into the mall as a black man, I'm going to be looked at. 
[01:51:30]  Looked at.  Right.  Or followed.  Or followed.  Really?  What if we're at a gathering, all of us are having dinner together, and there are pretty  much equal blacks and whites, and then the whites leave and you all start jiving?  Jiving?  See?  That's white.  That's very white.  Jiving?  No, get down, mama.  That's that past the crispy chicken.  That's a jive.  And you all start jiving?  Ugh.  Oh.  Why?  Don't you hear why we don't like you? 
[01:52:00]  Can't you hear it in this show?  Yeah, I didn't like her.  It's all right.  It's all right.  And every single thing that this guy says, it's like white people are always trying to  blow us off as nutty cuckoos who just be all, y'all just imagining shit.  You's crazy.  I am not imagining things when somebody comes up to me and asks me, can they help me in  a big and tall place?  Meaning, bitch, I'm 36.  I've been dressing myself.  I know what size drawers I wear.  I know what kind of clothes I like.  I'm in the whatever store. 
[01:52:30]  I know what I like, and I know how to shop.  What are you helping me with?  I'm asked, can I help you everywhere I go?  Yeah, because it's really, can I help you?  And the other one is, can I help you, you suspicious motherfucker with a big coat?  Can I help you not steal stuff?  Hey, big pants, can I help you not stick an entire telescope in those jeans and I not  know about it, you crackhead son of a bitch?  It's not our fault you wear everything baggy.  You could hide half a store in your clothes.  Do you think if their loss prevention department right there in that store with their cameras 
[01:53:00]  and everything else that they watch, watched white person after white person come in and  steal shit, do you think they'd still just follow black people or do you think they'd  be following white people?  They'd follow black people still.  Really?  And I truly believe that.  If everybody came in, stole, was white.  There is not one stereotype that white people do that make everybody look at white people  a certain way.  I don't know why you get a pass like that. 
[01:53:30]  I don't know why we don't.  Baseball, little league baseball or soccer coach is always looked at as a ped.  Well, I can't argue that.  I think so.  I can't argue that.  Priest.  White priest always looked at as a ped.  Well, they are.  That's not stereotypes.  There's probably a poor priest out there going, I just want to serve God.  I just want to serve God.  And all of a sudden I come in and everyone's looking at me saying, can I help you?  So you're doing the same thing.  I mean, most priests that join the priesthood aren't touching kids. 
[01:54:00]  It's a very, very, very tiny percent.  But that is a stereotype that has stuck.  If you talk to Colin Quinn, he has the theory behind it.  I can't repeat what Colin, but he has the theory of why they do it.  No one can.  It's some mumble language.  No one understands.  It's something about, I forgot.  I'm paraphrasing, but it's like, Irish people are very, that Catholic thing is very weird.  So priests are the gay little boys in the neighborhood that weren't tough and didn't play sports.  And they put them into the priesthood because that's what they are. 
[01:54:30]  They're not gay.  They're priests.  They're priests.  They're celibate because they serve God.  Hey, well, we're going to have to stop for now because we've got too much going on.  But this black and white show on FX is very interesting.  I got it DVR'd.  I'll watch it so I'll be more informed about it.  All right.  I'm not going to watch that fucking show.  I'll review.  We'll play more clips maybe on Monday.  We got Greg Giraldo here.  He's stopping by to say hi.  Also, we got to talk about the freaking video game.  We went on an hour tangent.  How did we turn left?  I have no idea.  But there's a video game they're up in arms about. 
[01:55:00]  We never did this.  We never got to.  What are we leaving?  I completely forgot about it.  My big mom going, why is cheese so expensive?  And then we got to talk about it for 40 minutes.  Jesus.  How about you edit yourself sometimes?  I really am going to ask.  It's like, what video game?  Man, do you hear Swiss cheese is causing cancer?  Patrice has been here.  Patrice has been here three days.  I think we talked about two subjects.  I got 20 we could talk about here.  I really have low attention deficit. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm just as guilty, though.  Where did we go?  I'll be going off on you.  Yeah, what about that cheese?  Can I guess that video game?  Go ahead, Patrice.  What is with ham?  Ham is salty.  And you know my blood pressure.  I can't deal with this salty ham.  Well, Patrice, let me tell you.  The salt is a preservative.  Like, I fall right into the fucking track with a ham.  Focus, Patrice.  And you know there's a motherfucker going, I got to go to work. 
[01:56:00]  Get to the video game, you fat fucker.  Man, but ham is important, too.  Don't we all like ham?  We were this close.  I was going for the button to push it.  Yep.  And you asked what the game is.  And at that point, I should have hit that.  But I made a dumb joke about the Asian with the text messaging.  Yep.  Saying that's the game.  You know, try to find the 13-year-old Chinese girl that's text messaging.  And then we, you know, wait, Opie took it there.  Yes.  You took it to the 13-year-old girl.  But then somehow, how did it get to black and white?  It always does.  It always does.  Doesn't it always just get down to that? 
[01:56:30]  And you know some guy is calling.  Will you shut your fat fucking mouth, motherfucker?  All right, listen, listen.  What's cheese?  Greg Gerardo is going to join the program next.  And we got an American mess.  Still doing the open call for American mess.  Is he here?  Every Friday, we do an open call.  They left?  Yeah, they left.  Because we never got to him?  Yeah, that's a long story.  Oh, no.  You guys decided to say no to that?  We didn't say no.  Who the fuck said no to this?  Lawyers.  Had to be lawyers. 
[01:57:00]  Lawyers.  Why would they say no to something like that?  That seems to be something that people do.  What did he want to put up?  Ben, explain what the guy want to do.  We haven't even announced this on the air.  I can't sit here and not squirm and think about it.  That guy was going to be our showstopper today.  They do that in the hospital, like a catheter.  Steve's better explain it.  Steve, tell us what the guy was going to do for American mess today.  He brought in a variety of sharp objects, like a screwdriver, a pen, a pencil.  I think I saw a digital thermometer. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, God, I can't.  I'm in pain.  He was going to put them up the head of his dick.  And that got nixed.  By who?  The lawyers.  Lawyers.  Lawyers.  Shit, you should say thank you.  He probably saved your jobs again.  That was going to be our showstopper.  Yeah, that was the showstopper, all right.  We like doing showstoppers.  We had a showstopper.  It stopped the show for two and a half years.  That's some guy who rips whatever that's called.  I don't even know.  He's going to shove pencils in. 
[01:58:00]  I don't even know the scientific name for the dick shaft.  It's just the piss hole.  The urethra?  The urethra, exactly.  The urethra, and then the, yeah, there's a name for everything.  So we're not going to have a showstopper.  As he stabs his sperm sack, his sperm just keeps coming.  Bleeds out on the floor there.  By the way, the people that stopped our show last time now like us.  Thank you.  Yay.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's what I had. 
[01:58:30]  All right, a couple things.  A week from today, we broadcast live from the Hard Rock Cafe for St. Paddy's Day.  That's right.  Different time for the show, though.  We're doing 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. East Coast time.  Yeah, we did it last year during our regular show time.  And, boy, when people start drinking at, like, 7 in the morning, it got real ugly.  So this time, it's prime drinking time.  And my brother's got a shirt.  Of course he's got a shirt.  Shirt for every occasion. 
[01:59:00]  Every occasion.  And if you're not going to the Hard Rock Cafe, you can get the shirts by going to MyRadioStore.com.  MyRadioStore.com for Brother Elmo's St. Paddy's Day t-shirts.  Right.  Got to say hi to Greg Giraldo in studio.  What's up, Greg?  What's up, fellas?  Greg's back in.  He's like, it's a little mellower today than last time I was here.  It was an insane asylum last time.  Yeah, because we had Twitchells jumping around and stuff.  Oh, that's right.  That's what's so weird about you guys.  You come, you know, you guys come and go, and we forget what was going on the last time you were here. 
[01:59:30]  Like, oh, yeah, we were doing that.  Remember that?  The Human Sacrifice.  Oh, you were a part of that show.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Who was it?  Twitchells with the high-pitched.  The guy reading the news.  Yeah, the big guy.  Yeah.  The stutter.  And one of the stories was about a guy who had, it was a plane crash or something.  Right, right.  So this one was literally breaking news.  You're like, somebody's hearing about their dead relative from this twitchy freak.  He'll be at the live broadcast.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:00:00]  All the stars will be there.  We're just...  All the celebrities of the show.  All right.  What a mess.  They're killing us on instant feedback and stuff, so we got to get to the game.  You play video games, Greg?  No, I don't.  No?  No, not really.  I'm going to start, though, now that I have kids.  Yeah.  What do you do with your time?  I can't imagine that.  You know, I wish I knew.  You never got into video games.  I think I'm the most boring person on the planet.  What was the last video game you played?  Probably Pong.  Pong.  Seriously?  I'm not even kidding. 
[02:00:30]  Not Pong, but like Space Invaders.  Like that era.  You know, when I was 12 years old.  That era.  You just gave up.  They've gotten so much.  They don't interest you or anything?  You know what it is?  I have so...  You were talking about ADD.  I have that so much to begin with.  It's like, that's all I need is another habit to, you know, try to break all my bad habits.  So, just sit around doing nothing for 12 hours.  Just observing stuff for your act or something?  You know, I just try to get, you know, my material from life.  Greg reads.  Yeah, I was just looking around.  A reader.  We got ourselves a reader.  God, I hate readers.  It's like, you know what it is? 
[02:01:00]  It's like, there's two different worlds in comedy.  There's, like, the Patton Oswalt's, and there's silly motherfuckers.  And Greg is caught in a vortex between those two.  Where Greg reads.  But if he's on this show, he can't go, well, fellas, you know, I get a special weekend edition  of the Wall Street Times.  The Wall Street Times.  A new paper.  Yeah.  Coming out next week.  The New York Journal Times Street.  I don't just read. 
[02:01:30]  He gets special papers from Tokyo.  He reads.  So, he comes in here.  He can't go, hey, man, I'm reading.  But, you know, he's in San Francisco.  And, God, what are you doing tonight?  I'm going to, Greg is one of those motherfuckers who does read the book to the movie.  Yeah, man.  Oh, wow.  Brokeback Mountain, the book.  Oh, that was so much better.  Yeah.  Well, that's just going to slow down.  There's things that happen in a tent that they didn't even get touch on.  Yeah, no, I liked it better.  The book was.  There was just definitely a lot more.  A lot more shit.  You know, when they describe how viscous his spit was when he spit it in his hand and rubbed 
[02:02:00]  it on his cock and stuff in the guy's ass, that's what the book gives you that the movie  really didn't get.  Plus, learning and seeing that viscous is spelled O-U-S.  I never would have thought.  That's the thing you pick up with the books, you know.  Greg said, he motivates well just through any, you know.  Yeah.  Give him that New York Times then, man.  He read that already today.  That thing just sits there.  That New York Times never leaves this fucking spot.  Look how worn out the New York Post is. 
[02:02:30]  Look at the New York Times.  It's like still pressed nicely.  You know what the Times used to be used for in here?  Before we got the shades, whenever we'd have nudity here in the studio, we couldn't have  the office area exposed to it just in case of sexual harassment or something.  So we would use the Times and tape it up on the window.  The same way like a monkey would use it to shit on.  And we just like tape it up so naked girl can get naked.  I know what's weird about that whole story.  We work with all guys.  All guys. 
[02:03:00]  But someone has a problem with females getting nude.  It is offensive.  I mean, in this day and age.  All right, let's get to the video games.  So they're having a problem with another video game.  A little problem.  And usually these are shooter games that people have a problem with.  If the theme of it is, you know, just go out there and kick some ass, kill some cops, steal  shit, beat hookers over the head with crowbars and steal the cars like Grand Theft Auto or  something, people get a little upset and it makes the news.  This one, I think they're running out of violent video games to get upset about because this 
[02:03:30]  is a little stupid.  Here's the story.  A new video game getting a whole lot of attention.  But it's not because of sex or violence.  It's because of graffiti.  It's called Contents Under Pressure.  The game calls for the player to graffiti a city that looks a lot like New York.  While the game's creator says there's not a gun inside, adversaries think it encourages  kids to act up.  We'd have to be naive to think that children are going to be satisfied with marring something  on a game.  It just excites them and the excitement is going to wear off until they do it for real. 
[02:04:00]  How to handle a shotgun to focus a sniper's range and, you know, boom, headshot.  You know, those are games that end up getting T ratings and sell all across, you know,  America in mainstream retail.  And you'll hear any politicians up in arms about that.  The designer points out that the game has an M rating for kids 17 and up.  So it's already got that.  It's already got a rating.  And that guy was so sure that the kids, they'll just get all excited. 
[02:04:30]  Like they're all worked up about spray painting on a video game.  First of all, that game sounds like it fucking stinks.  Yeah.  What kind of game?  That's the Mark Echo game.  You have Echo Clothing?  Sorry.  The clothing designer.  That's his game.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Really?  Well, it sounds horrid.  What the fuck are you going to graffiti in a video game?  I agree with the fucking shit.  I'm going to tell you.  Years ago, I went to...  Wait, you agree with what they're saying about the video games?  I went to therapy.  I used to run around and just eat dots off the floor while ghosts chased me until I ate 
[02:05:00]  one blue one and I chased those motherfuckers.  You chased them.  And that shit fucked me up for you.  Well, that sounds good.  You're not giving a shit.  Exactly.  I'm like, what?  Patrice, you were a big...  Remember you went through that killing hookers phase?  Yep.  You pay them and then you beat them over the head and steal their money.  First of all, it sounds like a shitty game.  Secondly, why do people believe that whatever you do in a game, you are destined to then 
[02:05:30]  just go out and now do it in real life because you're not satisfied.  Any game I've played, and I've played a lot of different types of games.  Shooters where you're killing people.  Shooters where you're killing monsters.  Society games where you have to build a city and make it work and function it.  I don't decide that, hey, look, I did a great job of building a city and making the  trains run on time.  I'm running for mayor.  Right, right.  I'm running for mayor because I did it here in Sim City.  How many times have you fought and actually ten-punch comboed a motherfucker? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, there you go.  I've fought many a time.  Bring on the...  I was going to say Tyson, but that dates me.  I could probably beat him now.  I'll quit.  I don't want to fight no more.  Punch out.  Yeah.  But it's like, why do people feel that just because you enjoy doing something in a game,  you're going to do it in real life?  You enjoy watching something in a movie.  That's a problem.  They've been trying for years to prove that point, too, and they just can't do it.  Oh, they cannot prove it.  They're doing studies and all sorts of shit.  It's like that sort of cliche mindset that the world is degenerating and everything's 
[02:06:30]  automatically getting worse.  When the crime statistics are down, there's not this...  Crime way down.  I was in the 70s growing up in Queens, New York, in the 70s.  This place was a urine-soaked shithole.  It was horrific.  There was no video games.  Do you remember any drive?  I remember growing up on Long Island, we would drive into New York City, and every mile,  the closer you got to the city, the more abandoned, burnt-out cars you would see on the sides  of the expressway, the parkways, like were just a dumping ground for stolen vehicles.  That is gone now.  You see a vehicle on the side of the road, you know it was some dumb drunk who got pulled 
[02:07:00]  over and had to leave his car there.  The crime has gone down, but for some reason they want to say that video games and movies  and the television shows are making kids more violent, and it's just not... everything  points to the opposite of that.  I'm not going to lie to you, dude.  I play Xbox 360.  I'm trying to get this Ghost Recon thing, but I was playing...  Remember Call of Duty 2?  Yeah.  If...  After you play it for a while, when they become so complex, you really do believe that you  strategically can survive in a war. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of get like, I can do that.  This thing that happened that I go, during the game, my strategy as a leader, I go, okay,  You're leading men.  Here's what I'm going to do.  I know that to computerize artificial intelligence, they're going to come here, but a lot of them  come here, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to lay in a corner, shoot that guy when  he comes in, and when they come, shoot them.  And all the bodies just going to pile up.  Right.  And the way you do it, you believe that you could make it through. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  You know, you send this guy over here, and now they have these games where you can control  your forces.  Your other guys, yeah.  And it's so real that maybe you might actually fucking, you know, think people will live.  Let me tell you something.  You think you're going to lay there as 50 Nazis come running in single file at your machine  guns.  They never work like that.  I play a game called Age of Empires 3.  It's a civilization-based game where you've got to build up your city, your walls get 
[02:08:30]  walls up, towers, gun emplacements.  What do they call those games?  Because after a while, the shit's going to hit the fan.  What do they call those games?  It's an RPG game.  RPG.  Yeah, role play.  I'm not even sure if that's it.  Role play game, right?  It's kind of like you're building up your societies, build an army.  That's fun.  But now you've got to have people also that have to farm and do things so you can get resources  to build more armies and equipment.  Dude, this takes, but you get so, no, these games sell like crazy and you get so into it. 
[02:09:00]  The balance that you have to do.  You could be a guy who just decides.  So your society could die if somebody don't grow corn.  Bingo.  But you can't.  Motherfuckers are hungry.  There are guys that could just sit there and go, I'm just going to farm.  This is going to be, I'm going to farm.  I'm going to mine for gold.  I'm going to mine for iron.  I'm going to gather up animals and do that and be a peaceful guy.  And you know what's going to happen?  About half hour into the game, a charge of army comes and wipes you the fuck out. 
[02:09:30]  This represents, like, how much time, okay, so you say you're the Ming Dynasty.  Yeah, right, exactly.  You're a farmer.  You're in charge of ore.  You've got to get hundreds of people are in this game.  Now, 30 minutes into the game represents, what, 100 years?  It could, yeah.  It could. 
[02:10:00]  Or you could slow it down.  It depends on how fast you upgrade.  You have to get to certain points where all of a sudden it'll go, you now qualify to upgrade  to the next age.  So now you're in, like, the Iron Age.  You go from all your army is these guys with sticks.  Wait, wait a minute.  Wait the fuck a second.  Okay.  So let's say you're in 20 AD or some shit.  Okay.  Okay?  So say you're living pretty peaceful.  Right.  And say 30 years goes by, no wars.  Uh-huh.  Do you have to assign fucking so that you have children to grow up that become soldiers to 
[02:10:30]  defend your fucking territory?  You go to your home base type area and start making people.  You make people.  And they're assigned as workers.  Yeah.  They're assigned as workers.  Then you have to build things like barracks and archeries for different military guys.  But babies don't grow.  No, babies don't grow.  All right.  All right.  And then after a while you've got to balance out your economy with your military because 
[02:11:00]  you're going to get attacked.  Now what I was getting to is the point is you're playing against the computer.  You can figure it out.  And I've done that.  I've gotten, like, up there quite a few levels playing against the computer.  There are ships.  You have a navy that could come in.  You build docks around there and guard them with your ships.  It's amazing.  I've built armies that are stunning, that have wiped out the computer's enemy that comes  after me.  Then I decide I'm going online, motherfucker. 
[02:11:30]  I'm playing other guys.  So I go online.  I set up and I'm pumping as fast as I can.  Now the adrenaline's gone.  I got to get this guy farming.  I need more water.  I can't build a fucking catapult.  I got this guy.  This guy's got to farm for corn because I've got to feed enough of these soldiers to make  them and more.  And I'm building.  I'm building.  I'm building.  I get an army up that I think is going to kick some ass.  But explain.  This takes days.  This isn't a couple-hour game.  No, this one, this game will take, this scenario will take about five, six, seven hours.  Where you're playing straight, there's no pausing. 
[02:12:00]  So is it one of those games where, okay, you think you're ready and you push.  Right.  You push ready and then it just does something and then it'll tell you if you want to launch.  You've got to kind of micromanage.  Yeah, you've got to fight.  You've got to kind of micromanage.  So what you do.  You do get to fight the other army.  Yeah.  What I like to do at first is set up some defenses.  I'm very defensive at the beginning while I'm trying to get enough gold.  Which represents your Long Island home.  Right.  That's my Long Island home.  So I'll build the army up.  And before I got enough guys, because on the computer, when I'm playing against the computer, 
[02:12:30]  I get an army together and send them out in like this mass and just kick ass.  Before I got enough army guys, I see elephants coming toward my big city.  Elephants coming.  These guys with these bazooka type things, cannons, demolishing my buildings.  This is the guy on live.  Yeah.  This is another guy in Cleveland somewhere that just knows how to do everything perfectly. 
[02:13:00]  Who implored kangaroos to fucking suicide bomber kangaroos.  Just ass handed to me.  So I'm looking at, here's how the game ends.  It's an elimination game.  So I have like one guy left running around the hillside with my former beautiful city in ruins  with one guy trying to build a house so I could start over again.  And he's just chasing me with like the biggest military I've ever seen.  And it was done.  What does the screen look like?  It wiped me out.  The screen is an overhead view from, you know, it could be from anywhere from ground level 
[02:13:30]  to about 100, 150 feet up.  Yeah, you can move around.  You can zoom in.  You move around the play area.  You could use different things like canyons and the sea and rivers as blocks and stuff.  But the object is, yeah, to build a society that works and a military that works.  And when you're playing against the computer, completely different animal than playing against  another human.  They will kick your ass.  I don't care how good you are.  Get your ass handed to you. 
[02:14:00]  But it's a great game.  Seven hours, by the way.  So what did you lack to get fucked up?  What did you say?  I don't know.  That's just it.  I don't know.  Where were your elephants now?  Why, exactly.  These guys have it down like math.  These guys raise elephants.  They have it like math in their head.  They know what to do, when to do it exactly to build their society.  But where was the elephant option?  The elephant option comes up like five levels in.  You go, now you advance to the Iron Age.  Now you advance to the Middle Ages.  So I got three guys with punji steaks poking at a metal wall. 
[02:14:30]  I couldn't upgrade.  I didn't have enough corn.  He got 20 farms running.  I don't know how he got it.  You were at the level where you just discovered fire.  I had a windmill.  You just discovered fire.  I had a windmill.  He's got a nuclear reactor.  This nigga just built a wind.  Right, right.  And why would you fight him?  I didn't fight him.  I was trying to build an army and get my level.  He already had his. 
[02:15:00]  He came and kicked my ass.  I'd have been happy sitting there.  Leave me alone.  You didn't get up to elephants, nigga.  I didn't get up fast enough.  How about Narnia?  What level is Narnia where you get a witch and a fucking talking cheetah?  Can you implement religion?  There are churches that you build.  Not so much in three.  In two, it was great.  You'd have priests that could go out and convert their troops.  So if you saw a bunch of their troops fucking with some shit, you'd send your priest over and you'd hear, oh, oh, oh.  And all of a sudden, bring. 
[02:15:30]  And his troops are now yours.  They turn around and start kicking ass on the guys that they were just fighting with.  Yeah.  So religion played a part in it.  It was.  It is a great game.  And I've spent upwards of seven hours.  Anthony, you need a fucking life.  Is that possible to get a life?  Why would.  This is what's going on out there.  There are games.  And it's getting more and more complicated.  There are games that are so immersive and complicated.  You know, a lot of people play Xbox and stuff.  And that's fine.  And PlayStation.  But I can't play a game with a controller.  In that I need games where I need a template that lays over my keyboard. 
[02:16:00]  I need something with pedals and throttle handles and fucking steering wheels and multi-monitors up on the wall.  You've got to see his gaming system.  He's the real deal, man.  Oh, my desk is ridiculous.  He's got, like, huge fans to try to keep everything cool.  The fans make so much noise, you can't hear the TV.  So the graphics cards are working, like, pumping out water-cooled motherfuckers that are just like.  I'm playing a full screen on widescreen monitors.  You know what?  That's fucking great, though, because you actually, look, you appreciate it. 
[02:16:30]  They're having more and more articles about this, too, that people are now living their lives online instead of in the real world.  It's more exciting.  It's a creepy thing.  I'm exploring this new internet world.  I mean, I was literate.  I was computer literate, but I think it's a creepy thing.  I don't like it.  I don't like these faceless weirdos out there.  Like, if you go, Neo is God, and if I didn't meet him, I wouldn't know he was just this hunchback little mess that comes in here.  And he's Superman on that fucking thing. 
[02:17:00]  It's like, Neo is God, and you'll see the thing.  You've got to explain it to Geraldo.  He's one of our faithful listeners, but he's scary online.  Pal talk.  Yeah.  The pal talk.  It's the pal talk thing, and you've got cameras and everything.  And on computer, man, it's like, here, Neo, in real life, Neo's like, he's like my pet retard.  I'll be like, this is my pet Neo here.  Down, Neo.  And on a computer, it'll be like, he has this control thing.  He has, he can control when he can talk. 
[02:17:30]  He knows how to control, like, just him talking, and you can't get in.  He's an admin in one of the fan rooms, which means he can control who talks, who doesn't talk.  He can throw people out of the room.  Superman.  Isn't that a more evolved?  Maybe that's the future.  That's the whole point.  We don't want that shit to be the future.  Being a bigger, strong guy is a primitive way of existing.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not my fucking point, which is being just a big, because there's bigger and stronger  dudes walking around.  I'm talking about just a person, just that you feel energy, and you can go back and forth, 
[02:18:00]  as opposed to, I'm typing, hey, what's going on?  And somebody, you know, types L-O-Fucking-L.  Oh, fuck your LOL ass, and your fucking smiley faces, and your, hey, man.  Like, the first time I ever in my life, about seven years ago, got on a computer and stopped  me from getting on a computer, is I typed, I had, I changed my fonts to red, all caps, 
[02:18:30]  and I go, and I go, hey, everybody, and some cunt goes, do you have to yell?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You fucking bitch, I'm yelling now!  That was just, that was my way of going, hi, everybody, I'm new to this, and now, do  you have to yell?  Hey, there you go, Neo, there you go.  There's a picture of Neo.  That's the boss.  There he is.  Does that have anything to do with me being just a big, primitive guy?  Master, blaster, run, Barker, town.  No, that is bigger and stronger, but yeah, I mean, you know, if he's got the capacity. 
[02:19:00]  That's how Caveman used to be built.  You know, in an evolved state, we're not going to have outward presences anymore.  No physical bodies.  Why would you say that, Greg?  Because that's what's going to happen.  And that's New York Times, but Greg doesn't even accept that.  Yeah, I do.  That's what kills me.  Greg, you don't!  What do you mean?  I think in the future, unfortunately, that guy is going to rule our society.  Who run Barker Town?  Who run Barker Town?  Master blaster, run Barker Town. 
[02:19:30]  Do you think...  That's Neo.  Oh, the nigga that sits on Man Max.  Let's see.  That's who he is.  He's the midget from Thunderdome.  This is time...  What's that shit?  Time...  The time machine?  Motherfuckers with...  Motherfuckers down low.  Oh, the Morlocks.  The Morlocks and the whitehead.  Get the...  That nigga ain't ruling shit.  It's a fucking master blaster.  He ain't ruling shit, but his...  He runs Barker Town at night.  He's not ruling shit except for his...  His authentic, fake John Cena belt and... 
[02:20:00]  And embargo.  And boom, he hits the button, you bounce from the fucking room.  And I like Neo, but I'm saying I can't.  That shit is creepy to me, and it fucking bugs me.  And then they come to the shows, and they don't know how to behave in society.  Like real people.  They don't know how to do it.  That's what I'm saying.  Greg knows he's not a part of this.  He's not a part of this.  He's an enigma. 
[02:20:30]  He's like a super studious guy, lawyer, the whole shit.  But this whole world is creepy to him, too, because they're mutants.  That come out, and you go, calm down.  And they don't know what calm down is coming from a human warmth.  All right, thank you for loving me, man, but just relax.  Yeah.  Because they're used to pushing smiley face.  Yay!  I love that you keep you...  Like, the examples of these guys, their ultra-sophisticated technological powers are that they go, LOL. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, that really didn't help your point.  Let's go to Yak.  Yak, what's up?  Yeah, I know the game that he's talking about, that civilization game, and he's leaving out the whole thing about the treaties.  Like, you'd make friends with a country, and then eventually you'd go fuck with them, and then they'd say, wait, we have a treaty.  And you'd be like, look, you know, and you'd throw your people around them.  You can make treaties with other countries when you're playing multiplayer.  Also, you can make treaties with people and then break the treaty.  Like, it's like, hey, dude, me and you, we'll get an army together, we'll kick this guy's ass. 
[02:21:30]  And it's like, okay.  And then after you kick his ass, you're the only two left.  What, are you going to live in harmony for a thousand years on your computer?  And that's what you're going to do.  Come back tomorrow and go, hey, how's your corn?  No, you're going to get your army and run into him and kick his ass.  Just like Survivor on TV.  Yeah.  Just like Survivor.  It's a matter of Long Island.  And you never make fucking friends, I can tell.  That's why you got your ass beat, because the guy made friends with elephant people.  No, I don't want to make friends.  You're right.  The guy's right.  I don't make any allies, nothing on them. 
[02:22:00]  Like, you'll see a message will come over.  Would you like to make a treaty with France over here?  And it's like, no.  And then here comes a huge French army.  Like, where did you go?  I'm still fucking baking bread.  Anthony's the only one on there with a phone that goes, hello?  Yeah, why are you calling me?  Yeah, I don't want to.  No.  Don't call my house, man.  Please.  On a daily basis, aside from the radio show, you know, on a daily basis, I interact with  a hell of a lot more people in fake life, in cyber life, than in real life. 
[02:22:30]  That's not good.  It's not good, but that's what the way.  I think if you ask a lot of people, except Greg, they fall into that category where between  message boards, you know, when I post on a message board, there's at least 50 people  right then and there that are going to read it.  It's not good, but it's happening.  And react to it.  Every kid in America is going right back to their room after school and having chats  with their friends with the IMF.  I go home, I see, well, here I see you guys.  I go home, I see my chick.  I see my close friends sometimes when they come over or something. 
[02:23:00]  Stop.  Stop with that lie.  Yeah.  What, that lie?  I'm talking very rare.  No, very rare.  I'm talking like Adam Ferraro come over like once in a blue moon.  Get out of here.  I'll see him.  Once in two years.  Adam's a creep.  Joe Curry.  Adam's a creep.  Adam's a strange motherfucking dude.  Adam is a creep and he's my pal.  He's just a super, Adam's like so super positive it makes my stomach hurt.  I know.  You keep thinking he's kidding.  You keep thinking he's got to be kidding.  Yeah, like it's like he's so nice.  You go, what's really going on motherfucker?  Where's the gimp?  He's always been that way.  I know something's in a trunk somewhere locked up.  And now Neo's extreme. 
[02:23:30]  I'm just fucking with Neo because Neo kind of to function in life as a, to feel what normalness,  normalcy feels like he would have to be on the computer.  It gives him a sense of, because you can't.  I mean, let's be fucking honest.  But I'm talking about why a 55 year old man with a full head of hair.  With beautiful doe eyes.  Why am I being fucking kept from seeing your beautiful eyes?  At least Opie will fucking, he'll roll his, you should see when he leaves the thing with 
[02:24:00]  Master fucking Poe wrapped up like Yoda on a cell phone.  I'm like, and I just did a show with him and the way his aura is, because I'm good with  reading shit, I go, I just, I give him a, hey, what's up man?  Like, I better not talk to him in the street.  Because he has this fucking hood and he's, he's not even walking.  He's floating like a Spike Lee movie.  And it's, that's how Anthony goes home.  You're so right.  And, and, and, and, and, it's like, you, I barely want to talk to Anthony because you 
[02:24:30]  can feel.  I flip the hood up because I hate cold.  Once it gets warm out, I don't wear the parka in the summer.  Fucking.  It's going to be 68 degrees in New York City.  When I walk down today to get to my truck, that hood will not be on.  He's only doing, cause he felt it.  And I'm saying, I'm like, man, I like last night.  It's like, you don't know how to, because it is a radio world, but you know, I like you  guys, you know what I mean?  But you go, like I'll, I'll text message Opie.  I wanted to keep, I actually wanted to call him and talk, but I'm like, I'll text message 
[02:25:00]  and I'll go, and we'll, I'll try to figure out at what text message does it stop?  Cause Opie's kind of a control freak.  So I said, maybe I'll let Opie have the last text.  And then it's like, you come out and fucking, you know, Boba Fett has got your back and walking  the streets and he's on the phone, not talking to anybody, just pushing buttons with his  hood up.  And I'm like, Hey, he's making corn. 
[02:25:30]  No, do you know what I do on that phone?  He can't wait to get home.  He's got to get his corn made.  Do you know what I do on that phone?  Well, I'm not making a phone call.  He's watching TV.  I have video on demand on my phone.  So I'm watching TV as I'm walking to my truck.  And I feel like he's watching the news.  That's good.  I watch it.  It's got to keep up.  I feel like I'm in the corner at the, at the closed down Italian restaurant on my phone.  I see Anthony come by.  I give him eye contact.  Like I don't, I haven't been talking to the nigga for follows.  I give him a, I'm not going to bother you, dude.  I recognize you. 
[02:26:00]  I enjoyed.  I walked to the garage.  We had a nice little conversation.  I enjoy talking to Patrice.  I go, Hey, and I don't want to.  I don't want to overextend our boundaries, even though we were actually together.  Yeah.  It was like Patrice goes, I go, Patrice, take it easy, man.  He goes, well, my car is parked in the, he's like making an excuse.  My car is parked in the same garage.  He goes, may I, may I, may I walk with you?  I don't want to make you feel like you have, cause I know you're a recluse.  Patrice, you are so welcome to walk and talk with me.  You're right on Howard Hughes.  You nailed it, though.  I'm fucking ready.  You nailed it.  Sounds like we're all really close pals. 
[02:26:30]  I realize at 11 o'clock we all go our own ways as fast as possible.  The older I get, the less people I want to deal with.  You're right.  I guess bowling's out then.  I've gone bowling.  It's hard to talk a lot with Patrice around, so I figured I would keep quiet on the radio  and then you and me would go bowling later.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  Patrice does tire itself, man.  He's got a lot of energy.  I love when Patrice comes on.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I can see it.  One day you're going to be starting the show telling us that Anson in a mental hospital 
[02:27:00]  screaming that he had to kill his video game chickens to keep the guy from Cleveland  from learning his Army's location.  Take it easy, guys.  You've got to be careful.  Let's go to Knuckle Child in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to ask Anthony if after all the years of EverQuest he finds himself in  his basement whittling arrows and working on his room craft.  Crafting arrows.  No, I haven't played EverQuest or EverQuest 2 or any of those games in a while.  Those take years off of your life.  You spend years playing it. 
[02:27:30]  Literally.  And they never end.  And they never end.  It just goes on and on to get to the next level.  And some parts of the game are combat.  Other parts are crafting arrows to use in combat.  For hours and hours and hours.  So for hours, you're trying to get experience points crafting things.  One time I spent hours making iron ingots so I could make a belt buckle.  And it just took hours.  Hold on.  That's not right.  Why don't you go see... 
[02:28:00]  You know, Anthony, why don't you go see fucking The Hills Have Eyes with me?  That's it.  Like go to the movies with you?  Let's just go to a movie and watch The Hills Have Eyes.  You know, I could probably get it from one of the guys.  They burn it.  And I watch it at home on my big screen.  It's great.  Patrice, granted it's not normal, but this is going on.  Explain the eBay thing with EverQuest.  That's even creepier.  People make characters for EverQuest.  Now, it takes years sometimes.  Some people power game.  But it takes years sometimes to build up your character. 
[02:28:30]  I've had the same character since 1998 on EverQuest.  EverQuest.  And it's valuable.  It's still there.  It's valuable.  Is he out there somewhere in the cyber world?  Yeah, right now he's crouched down somewhere just sitting there.  Just waiting to play again.  Waiting for me to log on and give him life again.  What's his name?  Andy Serkis?  I think his name is Vax.  V-H-A-X-X.  That's eight years of your fucking life.  Are you okay?  This character is sitting there.  I am so fine. 
[02:29:00]  You should develop years.  But he started out as just this guy from the north, from the north lands, the snowy north  lands, as nothing, with no possessions.  And now I have treasures beyond compare, Patrice.  Why are you condoning me?  You don't condone this, Greg.  You know what?  Power.  You don't condone this, Greg.  No, I don't.  I don't.  But I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here a little bit, which is, what's so great about  regular life, anyway?  Thank you.  Fuck you.  I'm not kidding.  Really, if you think about it, I mean, what the fuck? 
[02:29:30]  You could go, you could create ingots.  It's your five.  Right.  And you get to live, you get to, you know, live and exist.  What is an ordinary person day to day?  What is so good?  You've got a good life, Patrice.  You're a comic.  You get a lot of ass.  You know, having a regular life for an average, everyday person.  Patrice, have you ever been on a raid with 150 people to slay a dragon?  And I wouldn't fucking watch it.  Oh, well, my friend.  That's so nice you're missing, sir.  I don't want to be Shaka Zulu, motherfucker.  I want to be able to eat a fucking bagel with salmon cream cheese. 
[02:30:00]  All right, listen, listen.  Listen, listen.  Hold on, though.  Explain further the eBay thing, because this is how crazy this game gets.  So people build up their levels and build up their possessions to a point where they  then can sell their account on eBay, and these things went for thousands of dollars at some  point.  Somebody paid like five grand for a character.  Or a certain weapon, too, right?  Yeah, certain weapons.  They're like, I'll show you these.  Weapons that take what?  The staff of elimination can be sold to you. 
[02:30:30]  What's the oldest character?  How old is this game?  I think I was on it really at the beginning, so probably 98.  But listen how this exchange takes place.  This is the weirdest part about it.  What?  You've got to pay real money.  So you go on eBay with your character or this weapon that's really hard to do unless  you want to spend, I don't know, what, years on the game, whatever?  Yeah, yeah, years.  So you'll throw it on eBay.  I've got a certain weapon or a certain character.  And then somebody will say, well, I will pay you the $5,000 for that.  And they wait for the money to go into an account. 
[02:31:00]  And then they meet in cyberspace and what?  The character's handed over or the weapon's handed over or whatever?  Then you give your login name and password, and the character is then yours.  I'm going to pay for you to download it and keep it and then sell that motherfucker.  What's to keep you from selling 85 of these dudes?  Well, you would probably, I don't know, if you took the money and didn't give the password.  No, you get the password, but you just transfer him over to something.  You know what?  I'm guessing that the guys that spent 12 years developing these characters have some sort 
[02:31:30]  of some sort of system building.  Just like, yeah, something so they don't get ripped off.  No, no, no.  I'm saying the guy that's selling it to you.  Yeah.  I sell you my nine-year character.  I go, here's my nine-year character.  But I still have my nine-year character.  You put it in some kind of account.  You put the money in an account until everybody's happy.  Then the money's released.  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm saying I sell you my character.  Right.  You give me the money.  Okay.  But what keeps me, the guy who's selling the character, from keeping my imaginary fucking 
[02:32:00]  thing on my computer?  The name or password, you change it then.  The guy that bought it changes his password.  Now the old guy has no access to that character anymore.  No, I'm saying, isn't there something you can download?  No, it's on the game's servers.  The actual character isn't on your server, it's on the game's server.  You've got to log in on the game.  You can't just have it at your house.  Let's just hand over some graphic cartoon to some guy.  This is where it gets crazy.  Dave in Memphis.  Dave. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, boys.  Yeah, I had to tell my fucking wife, man.  She got so engulfed in these fucking RPGs.  Yeah, they were calling games like EverQuest and stuff The Widowmaker because it would break  up relationships like crazy.  There were people that just wouldn't pay attention to wives and girlfriends and boyfriends.  Let's see what happened to Dave.  So what happened, Dave?  What was the game?  It was called RuneScape, I think.  RuneScape.  Now it just turned her into a fucking zombie, man. 
[02:33:00]  The house, you know, never pick up.  She never fucking cleaned.  Thanks, Zach.  You know?  Just sits there.  You're still fucking living in this online virtual fucking world, man.  I mean, it just drove me nuts.  People get married in this world.  They have weddings where they invite people.  And they all gather.  And there's like a clergyman type guy.  And they buy rings.  They fashion them.  And exchange them.  And vows.  Vows shall not touch my pussy. 
[02:33:30]  Vows.  The second as I sit here and your dick is hard, you will not put your hands on the great  princess Orachian from the planet Bufla.  And you crazy bitch.  How many people really get into it?  There's so many people into it.  What if I smash that hand with this fucking keyboard?  How about that?  Yeah.  How about it?  Let's go to Jeremy in California.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I was going to tell Patrice and everybody, the whole allure of it all is you're escaping  reality.  You don't have to deal with the normal, everyday bullshit. 
[02:34:00]  You get on your computer and all your worries of your fat-ass wife or whatever goes away.  That's just sad, dude.  That's just fucking sad, man.  I don't know about that.  People are really enjoying their time on-  You smoke this shit to escape from reality?  Shit.  I am reality.  I am reality.  I am reality, motherfucker.  Are you- I'm not impressed with this shit.  I'm not- it doesn't make- I don't sympathize with this whole escape from fucking-  It's not escape from reality.  I gotta live reality, nigga. 
[02:34:30]  It's not escape.  I got diabetes.  I gotta- there's no magical mountain I could go on and not have to fucking take pills,  nigga.  It ain't no escaping reality game.  Deal with your shitty job.  I just- why can't you just- why can't you just- why can't you just enjoy it like-  Really?  The Widowmaker's enhancing your fucking life?  For some people, this enhances their life.  I love- I love-  You're like a- you're a- you're a 30-year-old guy living in your parents' basement working  at a deli, but online, you're a king of some fucking society, man.  Some realm.  So what happens after logging out? 
[02:35:00]  You log out, your character sits there where you had it until you log back on.  The game never ends.  What happens to you?  They get another-  Oh, me?  Logging out.  They get another addiction.  They get another video game they're into.  My brother's roommate spends well over 16 hours a day on one of these online games.  He has given up on doing anything social.  He goes to work, and he goes right to his room, closes the door, and you don't see him  until he has to go to work the next day.  You had to be real-  That's his entire life.  It's not an exaggeration.  I'll be over my brother's. 
[02:35:30]  It's 90 degrees, summer day, gorgeous, like get the fuck outside, have fun, right?  His shades are down.  He's online with his headphones just enjoying the hell out of himself.  He doesn't give a shit about the real world anymore.  You had to be real to do this.  You had to be real-  Yeah.  To do what you're doing.  Yep.  You had to be real to get into comedy.  You made a conscious decision to stay real.  There's times you wish you could take a Calgon bath and fucking leave it all behind and  go wild.  Take me away.  It's like, it's just like I don't have sympathy for people who commit suicide. 
[02:36:00]  It's like it's too easy to escape from fucking what reality, motherfucker?  It's not-  Handle your reality.  Handle your life.  Any entertainment.  You can-  Right.  But it's-  Anything you do to take-  But you don't-  You're not an escape from reality, comic Greg.  No, I'm not.  You give people reality when you're on stage.  You do.  Do you or do you not?  Yeah, nobody.  But it's just having fun for most people.  It's not an escape.  It's going-  I enjoy the graphics.  I like the gameplay.  It's fun.  At no time am I like, thank God I'm here in the castle. 
[02:36:30]  There are-  The reality out there, I don't want to deal with-  I find that hard.  I bet-  Look, man.  It's hard to raise a real dog for 10 years, let alone to take the time to raise a cyber-alien  nigger and sell it for a couple of dollars.  I just love-  I love how passionate you can get about-  Like, basically-  Oh, I know.  Should you spend 20 hours a day on one of these games?  Probably not.  But you're, like, fired up about it.  You're going to set them all straight. 
[02:37:00]  Because I get on these Pal Talks, and I'm a regular guy trying to be on Pal Talk, but  I'm with Super Johnson is great, bottom slash, who takes pride in this shit.  All I want to do is see a titty, nigger.  That's all.  I want to see a titty I can't see in real life.  How good is that?  Escaping reality are you?  No, nigger.  I'm trying to find it.  Because my conversation is high, bitch. 
[02:37:30]  Are you-  Are your lovey lumps 01 in Nevada?  Listen, you ever make it to New York, bitch?  I'm trying to get a bitch on a plane.  That is interactive.  Wow.  I'm not trying to-  Beep, beep, beep, boop.  Beep, beep, send.  Beep, boop, boop, send.  And the-  You want to reality-  I'm touching it.  You're using that as a tool to make it real.  To make it real.  All right.  Come touch me, baby.  I hear you.  How does that feel?  Better than that keyboard, huh, bitch?  I hear you.  But as far as all this virtual stuff, it's kind of the sex stuff that they have, which you 
[02:38:00]  think would be much more evolved, right?  Actually isn't.  Right?  They don't really have, like, great virtual sex interplay at this point yet.  No.  It's a lot of flashing of tits.  It's a lot of solo action.  A lot of guys jerking off on this goddamn thing.  But, you know, you got to weed through the bads.  I mean, you would think that by now, given what they're doing with everything else, that  you would have helmets and systems and things.  Wasn't it supposed to be like that?  When they showed it back in, you know, the early 90s, you put that virtual reality helmet 
[02:38:30]  on, laid back in the chair, and you're feeling titties and shit, and you're running your  hands down hips and fucking.  What was Stallone's movie?  What's that one?  Him and, what's the name?  Funny Face Sarah, Sandra Bullock.  Yeah.  There was a virtual reality.  Demolition Man.  Demolition Man.  Hey, just fucking in the helmet.  Yeah.  Fucking in the helmet.  I saw this chick in Reno, dude, and I'm like, me and my girl looking at her, and we're  doing, we have to do the whole computerized comfort zone, the computerized foreplay, like, 
[02:39:00]  hey, why don't you be, wink, wink, whisper cam, and how about I invite you into, hey, make  a new friend room, and then it's like, hey, sweetie, and I'm trying to figure out, okay,  this was great over the internet, this is beautiful, but listen, you going to be in New  York?  Yeah.  I got a website.  Go to patricionnew.com.  You know I ain't no thrasher, bitch.  You know what I mean?  Just tell people you come to visit Patrice, and they're going to find me.  I ain't going to kill you, bitch.  He is trying to get girls live.  Nigga, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, come on and see me. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Come on and see me, baby.  How's that working out for you?  Look, I'm a master that gets some titties.  I'm a master at that shit.  I've had bill collectors come and visit me, nigga, and I'm not bullshitting.  Bitch come to try to collect money, and I'm like, oh, puddin' pop.  What is this all about?  Is this fulfilling?  You're going to try to take, you're going to try to take money from a black man.  You know, come on, baby.  You know what college is like.  Come on, see me.  Come see me.  That's what I want.  I don't want this, this magical plate, like this, this Lucci chick that runs your, your  fan site. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, there she is.  Like, it's like, come on, baby.  Come out.  Look at this, look at this bitch.  I don't want to talk to this bitch on the screen.  She got big old juicy teams.  She came out, she was at FH Riley's walking around.  Yeah, but she hides.  Well, she's, she's, she's just regular bitch on the, on the, on, at FH Riley's, but on  his, she's Lucy 18.  All right, here we go.  Mark in Georgia.  He lives in the virtual world.  Mark?  Yeah, I used to.  What happened?  You used to, huh?  Oh, yeah, we did, uh, Air War for about four years, man.  Air War?  You got to build your, Air Wars, yeah. 
[02:40:30]  Air Warrior.  And you got to build and, uh, it takes years to.  You got, you got to build your own airplanes.  You got to learn how to fly.  Then you got to learn how to fight to freaking stay alive.  Yeah, there's that whole time thing.  That's the, those are the addicting games.  The ones that take a lot of time to get to anywhere valuable.  And it's like 12 hours a day.  Next thing I know, it's like, damn, I hadn't eaten in the last 24 hours, you know?  You hear this? 
[02:41:00]  He, he stopped eating.  Do you know who got way deep into EverQuest and EverQuest 2?  Keith the Cop.  He was so deep for a while, he figured out how much time he wasted playing the game and  what he would have been able to earn in overtime, uh, if he would have not played the game and  worked.  And it was just hundreds of thousands of dollars.  That he wound up just wasting away.  And this guy stopped.  Wait, let's see what happened with Mark.  So what happened, Mark?  You did this for four years, you, it got to a point, you forgot to eat?  I, I, I went and bought two new computers, every fastest upgrade, anything that could come 
[02:41:30]  out for videos and sound was there.  I built a whole room just for this computer system.  And it sounds like he got money to spare.  Yeah.  And then the, and then the ex-wife said, that was enough, bye.  She left you.  She left you.  Oh yeah.  Holy shit.  Every bit of it was gone.  Wow.  Did she take half your gaming system?  That's what, that's what I, that's what I knew I was addicted to the shit, I turned 
[02:42:00]  it off.  And you haven't played since?  No, I couldn't.  Man, look, it was, it was worse than the, I don't even know what kind of addiction I  was.  Mark, I gotta tell you, the games now, oh, they're so good.  Is your life better now, dude?  Come on, give it a try.  They made the crack stronger, bro.  You gotta check it out.  Is your life better now, dude?  Is your life better?  Yes, it is, thank God.  I didn't know what I was missing until I got out of it.  Life.  I appreciate it.  Man, we're onto something.  Thank you. 
[02:42:30]  I can't even, what's your name?  Dikyera?  Dikyereum.  What?  Dikyereum.  That's his magic screen say, that's his, that's not his real name, but that's Jeff.  He's Dikyereum, the evil lord of justice.  He's Jeff and he works at Foot Locker.  Hey, you Dikyereum, fucking asshole.  What's your story, bro?  Well, I met my wife on EverQuest about three years ago.  We used to, we used to meet out by the lake, by a small town in one of the, one of the realms.  They met in the cyber world.  We'd start fishing and then we'd, you know, go on hunting parties together and. 
[02:43:00]  Wait, did you?  Yeah, you can fish.  But did you actually have a spot in the cyber world?  I'll meet you by the lake.  Yeah.  I got, I did on after work.  Did she cyber stand you up and did you have to cyber take her to dinner too, you, you psychopath?  There, there are, there are, there are lands in these games that aren't just random.  I mean, and they're huge.  These games are huge.  The, the, the land in it would take you days to like run across. 
[02:43:30]  And, uh, you, you get familiar with the spots and the areas and, and locations and cities.  Like you'll go out on a hunting thing and be gone for like, for like weeks doing this and  then come back to your home city and be like, ah, I remember this place.  You know, all the, you know, all the places, you know, where to go and where certain people  hang out and stuff.  And it becomes a society of all these people online that becomes very familiar.  So you met your wife on, uh, EverQuest.  You're meeting at an imaginary lake in the cyber world. 
[02:44:00]  And then you have to meet in the real world eventually.  How was that?  Well, I, I paid for her to get a bus ticket down.  We, we've been seeing each other on, uh, on EverQuest.  Just as romantic as, uh, meeting by the lake.  I'm sending a coach for you, my dear.  A horse-drawn coach.  Your chariots are arriving on.  Greyhound.  I just found out the Greyhound ticket.  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  The ticket had a waxed, uh, seal that when it, when it broke, Jesus came and fished. 
[02:44:30]  Here!  This will give you safe passage!  Magic Higgsie dust.  Safe passage to my realm!  What was her name?  Morlocks 114?  Alright.  So you met her?  She took a bus to see you?  Right.  Well, we decided to move in together.  I mean, we didn't just see each other for the first time.  When we met, she was, you know, already looking for a job down here.  So I paid for her bus ticket, and she came down,  and she stayed for a couple of weeks to look for a job. 
[02:45:00]  What did she get, armor crafter?  Was she looking for armor crafting work?  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  This is just unbelievable, man.  Oh, no, this has happened more than you realize.  Are you guys happy?  Yeah, we're pretty happy.  We play probably about six hours a night now.  We look at our laptops together.  We sit on the bed, and we play.  And we'll chat back and forth.  Wait, you're in bed with your laptops.  Tell me you're meeting in the cyber world, even though she's right next to you.  She's right next to you. 
[02:45:30]  Please tell me we're doing that.  Yeah, we still hunt together, and we still hunt together.  I got to a point.  Does she start getting pissed off because you're looking at other women in the cyber world?  I saw you talking to a half-goat fish woman.  I saw you squirrel hunting.  You think the half-elves are cuter than me.  Why were you squirrel hunting?  You don't like squirrel hunting.  Do I look fat in this chain mail?  Why'd you go off to the planet Plutox? 
[02:46:00]  It says here you went to Plutox.  Well, baby, come on.  Now they're on a free trip.  I used to set up.  I had three accounts on three computers.  You know that shit's going on today.  I heard you got the princess from Mario Brothers pregnant.  There you go.  You never went north of the lake before.  What's over there?  Yeah, who told you about this spot?  Nothing.  What we're trying to say is no amount of technology can make these bitches bearable. 
[02:46:30]  We never caught this many fish.  Who told you about this fishing spot?  D, D, Kira, whatever.  What were you going to say?  Well, I was going to say that we've got a raid foreman right now, so I'm going to have  to let you guys go.  A what foreman?  A raid?  He's got a raid.  50 people we're going to go slay.  Oh, see.  He only had enough time to...  He's got a raid foreman.  That sometimes takes hours to get a raid together.  That was probably too much.  Dude, let me tell you something.  You're trying to coordinate 150 people in a raid. 
[02:47:00]  And these are all individuals all over the country, geeks from everywhere, in a room somewhere  to go in and slay this, like, dragon, usually, that has so much power and hit points that  it can kill you.  It's got something called, like, death touch, where all of a sudden, 25 guys will be wiped  out dead, just in one wave of this thing's wing or something.  So you get this raid together, and it would take five hours sometimes to coordinate 150  people to what you're going to do. 
[02:47:30]  So the raid goes in, and it's a wipe in about five minutes.  Everyone's completely wiped out and dead.  And the rest of the night is trying to revive everybody.  Whatever happened to this short attention span thing that these games were supposed to be?  Well, some people have short attention spans, but people that do this cannot have.  They are the ones that are the OCD people that are meticulous, that pound every day.  Must go up another level.  I'm level 15.  Must reach 16 by tonight.  Have to reach 17 by tomorrow. 
[02:48:00]  I'll be in in a minute.  I'm so close to level 18.  I got to reach.  Screw eating, screw sleeping, screw my job.  But you don't even understand.  It's not screw eating, screw sleeping, screw your job.  It's, holy shit, I thought that was five minutes.  It's been 12 hours that went by.  You don't realize that much time went by.  Then you're lucky enough to max out at, like, level 60, and all of a sudden, no, now it's  level 70.  Expansion pack comes out.  Now, level 75.  You made it up to level 60.  Oh, 75's tops now.  Let's go to JR in Atlanta. 
[02:48:30]  They keep the crack coming.  JR.  What's up there, buddy?  JR.  I guess we lost him.  No.  I guess Fortune Magazine was talking about some of this stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's still very huge.  I mean, a lot of people are doing this.  It's amazing.  We could talk for the next hour on this.  I mean, some guy sold his character here.  Look, he's looking for $900 for selling my time invested in account.  That's how they have to sell them. 
[02:49:00]  You have to say, my time invested, because the account actually belongs to the company  that runs the game.  I mean, it's illegal to do this.  It's a level 70 bard with over 120.  These are extra points that you're going to get.  Yeah.  He has 12,000 hit points and 10,000 mana unbuffed.  That's his potential to do magic.  It's measured in mana.  He is track V and anguish flagged, which means he can get into certain cool areas. 
[02:49:30]  He has his epic 2.0 weapon.  Your epic weapons take months to get.  Months to get.  And he just spells it out.  All of his spells, even ancient level 70s.  He's not the original owner, so I cannot transfer him.  I'm willing to show him to anyone interested in the game.  Um, this guy's selling it for $900 he wants for his time invested.  And he'll get it. 
[02:50:00]  You got to feel good about yourself when you lay out a thousand bucks and just come in  and slaughter everybody with someone else's dude.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  You know what happens?  They get chastised.  They get yelled at in rooms.  Fucking noob with your eBay character.  Hey, we got a noob here with his eBay character.  Do you guys try to gang up on those type of guys?  Yeah, sometimes.  In player versus player.  We could talk about this all day, but we'll move on.  We'll move on. 
[02:50:30]  Great job, though.  In the studio.  Are you promoting anything, Greg?  No.  All right.  No.  Just trying to stay alive day to day.  Very funny comedian.  Very funny.  Absolutely.  Now ask one of these MySpace cyber fucking comics if they got anything to promote.  And they don't.  But bad comics are always ready to fucking promote.  Yeah.  I got a bumper sticker.  Well, I mean, I'm just really here.  I got my new CD record release bumper sticker bag of marbles promotion gimmick coming up on Tuesday.  See the cynic.  See the.  Oh, yeah.  That's why we like him. 
[02:51:00]  This cocksucker will not join me in this.  He hates that shit, too.  Yeah.  But some of them, his fans, you know, Greg's a nice guy.  But he fucking knows these clowns.  He's being forced to promote himself.  I've been raped into coming into MySpace.  Friend request.  Jimmy Hatz.  Fucking.  Jimmy Hatz.  I hear he's hysterical.  With fucking Rocky the Squirrel as his face.  And I have to go, yeah, sure, friend.  I have 5,000.  I want Rocky the fucking squirrel at my show. 
[02:51:30]  Suck my balls.  It is the worst.  It is the worst thing right now.  It really is.  And we even got a MySpace account.  You got MySpace?  I started doing it a couple weeks ago.  Because you just have to.  You have to.  There's no way you can fight it anymore.  And the reality is sometimes it's not a bad thing, you know.  But what's fucked about it is that these guys who really are not good.  And I don't mean just like the big famous guys with the huge MySpace accounts.  But a lot of guys that you go on there and they have 13,000, 15,000.  And they blow, but they're selling out.  They're doing it.  And it's almost becoming irrelevant whether you're good or not.  Up to 16,000 friends.  I'm teetering on 16,000. 
[02:52:00]  And a lot of people write me.  And I had a fun exchange with a fan the other day.  He wrote and said, hey, asshole, nice background on your web page.  Good idea.  Light text on a gray background.  Now, I'm pretty computer savvy.  I do a little HTML programming.  So I kind of got my MySpace looking nice.  I got video on there and stuff.  And nice background of one of my favorite video games, Half-Life.  So I wrote him back.  I go, hey, asshole, if you had a connection worth of shit or a computer that wasn't a piece of crap or you waited 10 seconds longer for the background to load, you'd have noticed I have a beautiful Half-Life background that works great with my text. 
[02:52:30]  I expect an apology.  And he writes back.  And he goes, oh, nice background.  So I wrote him back and went, um, I didn't see a sorry there.  And his answer to the whole thing was, Jesus Christ, I thought you said you never wrote back to any of the fans. 
[02:53:00]  He's just aggravated now.  That guy was pretty easily smacked down.  Yeah, just smacked him.  Had low self-esteem in Magic World.  Oh, smack a lot of these people.  But you realize when you have so many people like that write you that they ask a lot of the same questions.  So I have things in notepad, cut and paste, cut and paste, cut and paste.  And people are like, dude, I so didn't expect you to just go on that long.  Thanks for writing, man.  That's so cool of you.  They do that with stand-up all the time.  These guys, you get those guys like these open micers like, hey, I've done stand-up once and you're one of my favorite comedians. 
[02:53:30]  I thought maybe you could spend six hours writing me an eight-page document on how to become.  What have you done for the last 14 years?  Well, young fella in Cleveland.  Yeah, I have a cut and paste for just about every occasion.  All I do is go, hey, Bob, cut, paste.  I just say thanks no matter what.  See, I can't do that.  I don't want people to think I'm not writing them back.  I love everything you do.  I put, you know what, thanks, nigger, so they know it's me.  Oh, there you go.  Thanks, nigger.  Patrice.  That's Patrice. 
[02:54:00]  Thanks, fuckface.  And just to let you know, it's really me, you.  A lot of people ask me about the, I have a video on my MySpace of me sitting at a webcam.  That is really creepy, by the way.  And then I come in from behind me and look over my shoulder.  It's another me coming in.  And people want to know how I did it, the software I use.  And for a while, I'm taking a half hour giving this guy a Premiere After Effects 8.0 lesson  on how to clone a person on computer software. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, did you notice that Peter Jackson was in my top eight?  I'm like, yeah, I know.  You didn't notice that?  It's called CGI.  That was Andy Sergius.  This is how I did it.  I filmed myself in front of a green screen.  Not a fake friend like you have.  He's actually a friend of mine.  Sent the video off to Industrial Lights and Magic.  So I put the whole thing in a cut and paste, and I did that.  And I have a lot of people go, dude, thanks for taking the time.  And I wrote to one guy and said, don't feel so special.  I go, I cut and paste that to about 1,000 people.  And I said, but you can feel better because what I'm writing you right now 
[02:55:00]  is not cut and paste.  But I'm going to have to start cutting and pasting that  when people assume that I'm writing to them.  We should take a break.  Greg Giraldo in the studio.  We do have a MySpace account officially for the radio show,  Opie and Anthony.  How many fans?  Did you beat Dane Cook yet?  We officially just started up, I don't know, a couple thousand.  I mean, Anthony's got his own account that's what, you know,  is doing real well.  15, but Norton's got 17 or something like that.  I already got six.  I started yesterday.  I've been trying to beat Norton.  Pussies.  Really?  Oh, fuck.  The first 6,000 comes fast, pal. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, the next 11 is the hardest.  That's the hard one.  6,000?  Something like that.  Man.  I think I have 700.  Some stupid shit.  We got 2,500.  And then it's like, I'll throw your bone.  Hey, Patrice, I'll put you in my top eight.  I'll help you out.  All right, listen.  When we get back, we're going to do news teases.  Nice.  I think you'll have fun with this, Greg Giraldo.  More fear.  We hate fear-mongering.  We hate the news teases.  And every once in a while, we take a look at all the crazy news teases they have out there  to make you watch their dumb news program. 
[02:56:00]  At this point, we have no comments.  Don't even ask.  No comments.  Cannot comment.  More info to come.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  Greg Giraldo in studio today.  Patrice O'Neal filling in for Jim Norton, doing a great job for us.  Thank you, Patrice.  Thank you.  I don't want anything.  I'm just giving you props.  I didn't say anything.  Don't be all suspicious.  I'm just giving you a compliment.  I'm just saying thank you.  I'm looking at this fucking box and I'm just saying thanks. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that's why.  Okay.  I am so sorry.  You're giving me the luck.  No.  I'm just saying.  I'll compliment you when we're not on the air.  And I think I'm going to do the show with you tomorrow night when you do your little relationship  show.  That's very nice of you, man.  I ain't talking.  I'll just hang and laugh at you.  Be the board op.  Oh, I'm going to board op and I'll jump in a little bit.  How's that?  Hey, man.  You're the one that fucking gave me the opportunity.  The benefit.  I have to fucking actually say.  Opie's the one that said, hey, maybe you should do that.  Yeah.  All right.  That's fucking fair enough.  But, you know, I give you props. 
[02:57:00]  And I think our friendship is starting to blossom a little bit.  Probably almost.  We're now text messaging each other.  You know what I think is that our relationship is at the level of when a bee fucks the plant  and then shits whatever he shits in the air and then hits the plant, we're the shit in  the air before the plant.  Wow.  We're pre-pollination.  That's a good sort of relationship metaphor that'll be flying around tomorrow.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  We're at the stage.  We're the snake. 
[02:57:30]  Tell your bitch that she's the shit that fuck.  We're this close.  Patrice, we're this close to going to see a movie together.  Wow.  We just got to decide what movie we could see together.  You can't get close to Patrice.  Because I don't see those black movies.  You can't get close to Patrice.  You start thinking you're friends and then he turns on you because he can't take the war.  You got it.  I'm the same way.  That's why I think this might work.  That's why I couldn't be friends with Bob Kelly.  He was dripping like desperation.  Oh, no.  Don't say that.  Don't fucking say that. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, God damn.  What the fuck is wrong with you, man?  You ever hear the Bob Kelly story?  I'm hanging out with Norton and Bob Kelly at a Starbucks and it was at the stage that  Patrice and I are at.  You know, we're feeling each other out like, man, we could be friends.  I actually looked at him at Starbucks.  I go, dude, this is where it ends.  I just, I can't be a friend.  Because he's bad?  And I meant it, too.  No, because he wants friendship from him.  Yeah.  He wants it so bad that it's like, ugh.  And I actually pulled him in a Starbucks near Jimmy's old joint.  And he's like, what the hell is wrong with you? 
[02:58:30]  I'm like, just being honest.  It's like walking around with this.  Both really distant.  Yes, Anthony, I'm sorry.  The guy that was going to come in for the freak thing today for American Mess.  Yeah.  He was going to stick things into his peenie hole.  Yeah.  He's available on Pal Talk.  Yes.  On Cam.  Hey, he's doing what he wants to do.  Yeah.  We have nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  All right, that'll be the showstopper.  The dude that was going to come in and shove things in his pee hole. 
[02:59:00]  Ugh.  He's going to do it live in studio on a webcam, by the way, so the rest of the country could see.  Yeah.  Well, for some reason, lawyers don't want us to do that.  So now he's going to do the exact same thing, just from a different location.  From the comfort of his own home, I guess.  I'm having a lot of problems keeping the camera going here.  All right, why don't we...  It's really shaky.  Why don't we do some fine adjusting and see if we can get the Pal Talk camera all set and ready to go.  And we'll do it before the show ends today, okay?  Well, there's...  But you might want to head to the Pal Talk rooms.  There's his cam. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Tell him we're not ready for him yet.  Yeah, not yet.  We'll let you know.  Ben, what do you got?  Ben's got a box.  There's a package for you and Anthony here.  Actually, I'm playing along.  I know exactly what it is.  Of course you know what it is.  It's your Ron and Fez t-shirt.  Oh, there we go.  Here you go, Patrice.  They sent something for you.  Where?  Oh, that's the package.  Hey, they're cool, guys.  It has nothing to do with Ron and Fez's fucking t-shirt.  Oh, and what is this?  Holy crap.  Come on.  That smack had nothing to do with Ron and Fez. 
[03:00:00]  Look at what we get.  Yeah, just two of them.  Let's see.  Let me just make sure.  Just when you were feeling good about yourself, Patrice O'Neal, you get a reality check.  Here we go.  And 45 in the morning, okay.  And Joy, if these are not active, please call me.  I can get it done.  Elo.  Hey, Elo.  Sorry, man.  I listened to Carrie Underwood yesterday.  She was great.  I bought her an album.  She's great.  Oh, my God. 
[03:00:30]  Would you look at this?  This is the next phase.  This is what the Satellite Radio is.  The Satellite Radio is now.  Here it is.  Down to.  Here it is.  Completely.  It's smaller than my Blackbird.  Here it is.  It's smaller than my Blackbird.  Completely portable.  And this isn't one of those sham-like fucking serious where you have to plug it in and download  shit and then take it with you.  Live programming.  I'm not going to give it to you.  Let me touch it.  I don't have a brother here with a gun that like...  Let me touch it.  This is fucking unbelievable. 
[03:01:00]  Did he not know it was a...  Did Elo, the racist, not know that it was a black man in here that would love to listen  to XM?  There are only two of these available right now.  Even Jimmy Norton didn't get one.  From XM?  From the XM factory.  They made two?  They made two just for us.  Really?  Just like the two new 2007 Fords?  I am so excited.  These are not on the market yet.  They're going to be on the market in a couple more weeks.  They're in the studio.  Take that back from Patrice.  That's right.  Take it back from him.  Wow, this is... 
[03:01:30]  This looks better than my phone!  This is live satellite you get as you're walking around.  No friggin' download.  And you can download MP3s, live XM, and MP3s.  Here we go.  There you go.  The future kids.  Catch up with this doggy.  With their backpack, with their Apollo astronaut wear, that they gotta wear to get live programming, portable.  We don't have it yet, because the technology isn't there, Robin. 
[03:02:00]  That's why we don't have the portable unit.  No, the technology's out.  It's just here, not over there.  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, this is Ben.  Norton's gonna be leaving for a couple of weeks.  You wanna come through?  Oh, damn, you're playing that game?  Yeah, man, man.  I'll come on through.  That Bob Kelly's not a bad guy, after all.  That's great.  Ow!  I would've loved to fuckin' have a goddamn Wi-Fi. 
[03:02:30]  We gave you an XM, didn't we?  Yeah, I gotta wrap that around my neck.  And stick my head out the window for that shit to...  Alright, phase one, you guys.  We'll upgrade your XM, how's that sound?  We'll upgrade you.  You'll send me the software and shit?  That is hot, though, I like that shit.  You know what, I got a Wi-Fi I don't need anymore.  I can't just throw it on the ground, and I'll crawl around in mousetraps again.  Don't look how thin this thing is.  Don't look fucked up.  I love my Wi-Fi to this day, and this thing just blows the Wi-Fi away. 
[03:03:00]  Completely.  No offense to the people that got the Wi-Fi out there.  It looks like a phone.  Dude, for the PalTalk camera, I held up my BlackBerry next to the new Helix.  It's not even funny how much smaller it is than the BlackBerry.  But it's heavy.  It looks like a goddamn trio or something.  It looks like a computer.  Smaller than a trio.  It's smaller than a trio, my friend.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  That is great.  It's fuckin' nice.  It is nice.  Nice.  Live stuff is amazing.  They sent something from that other one, the serious one that Pamela Anderson roast. 
[03:03:30]  They gave us a ton of subscriptions and everything.  But when I read it, you've got to download it.  Who the hell is going to put that?  It's still sitting in a box.  Yeah, for some reason, they are trying to push to everybody that it's not available.  You can't get live satellite broadcast.  And XM's had it with the Wi-Fi, and that was just phase one.  This right here and where it's going to go from this, it's just amazing how small this is.  And you walk around, live broadcast of satellite radio.  How much is it going to be?  No restrictions, no bullshit. 
[03:04:00]  How much is it going to be, you think?  It'll be up there at first, you know, but then the price is $400, you think?  They give it to me for free.  I have no idea what the prices are.  I was wondering, fellas, is it possible I can take some of these Tums home?  Ah, they're Jimmies.  So listen, you know, the little guy's got a sour stomach all the time.  I want to thank Eric Logan for sending us the Helix.  Elo.  This is just like being paid what we're worth.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's it.  Thank you so much, Elo.  Was this a little prize for us?  Because we've been chirping? 
[03:04:30]  Chirp, chirp.  This is just like being paid what we're worth.  Thank you.  Thank you for the distraction, Elo.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We'll be distracted for a day.  Thanks, Opie.  I was actually feeling good for a second.  I know the corporate world.  I know what they're up to.  They know we're not completely happy right now.  So, well, make sure you send them up a Helix immediately.  That'll distract them.  Yeah, for a day.  Maybe a weekend.  You know what happens sometimes when you're hanging out?  You got your chick. 
[03:05:00]  And another chick comes along, right?  And wants to have sex with you.  The chick that you're with is going to do a little something extra, right?  To keep the other chick from getting too much of your attention.  Well, the problem also...  No comment on the rest.  No comment.  Well, the problem, though, is that we got two chicks.  Yeah.  And we don't live in Utah.  Yeah.  So, it's like, how do you balance the two chicks?  Well, two chicks are kind of hot on each other. 
[03:05:30]  Could be a threesome.  Right.  Yeah.  But you got to give each chick individual attention.  Each chick has to get equal attention.  You got to make sure that chick doesn't get pissed off at the other chick because you're  paying attention too much to the one chick.  And not only that, your friends really like the chick you have.  We said no comment.  This is the best we can do today.  Are you the chicks?  Hold on.  No.  No.  We're the dude with the two chicks.  We're the guy with the two chicks.  Now, look.  We're the dude with the two chicks.  Our friends really like the chick we've been with. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  And they don't want this new chick to fuck up how cool this other chick is.  Right.  Uh-oh.  Right.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Right.  I don't like this.  So, we can really say right now.  Oh, this is a sneaky white meeting.  But what if the two chicks were twins?  Two chicks are like twins?  Well, they're not twins, though.  Yeah, I know.  That's a problem.  Like one chick likes one thing. 
[03:06:30]  One chick, I think.  I think one chick's a little kinky or a little dirty than the other one.  Yeah, one chick likes to get down and dirty.  Right.  The other chick is a little more.  And the other chick's kind of like a soccer mom.  Because she's been raised in an environment that she's had a lot of rules that she's had  to pay attention to.  She has parents and stuff that watch over her that make sure she's being the way she  should be.  The other chick, though, is just a slut.  That's right.  No one's looking after her.  That's right.  You can just fuck any time she wants.  You can pretty much do whatever you want with the one chick.  Right.  But the two chicks kind of get along. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  They are friends.  Because of us, they're getting along.  Right.  Because there's a mutual interest.  The guy.  You're the guy.  Yeah, of course you're the guy.  The one chick you're going to have to take out on a lot of dates.  Yeah.  A lot of dates.  The other chick, you can just bang her and then drop her off.  Hold her off.  Now, one chick is really.  You're going to have to drop her off.  One chick's really an attention whore.  Right.  She wants to monopolize a lot of time.  Right.  But the other chick is a little more open. 
[03:07:30]  There's some appeal to the other chick.  There's a lot of appeal to the other chick.  And both chicks know about each other.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Both chicks know about each other.  Oh, yeah.  They want to hook up and do a threesome.  So is the soccer mom willing to be a whore for the men that she likes?  The soccer mom would like to be a whore, but the soccer mom has so much psychological  baggage from its upbringing that it can't just be a whore.  The soccer mom would love to be a whore if no one was looking.  But she's trying to compete with the whore?  Not compete with the whore.  Know that the whore has her role. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  And she wants to act with the whore.  Why can't there just be a whore and the nice girl in the threesome?  You know?  Like, so one lick your nipples and the other one is just sucking your balls.  Right, right.  Exactly.  And the one licking your nipples goes, wow, she's a real ball sucker.  And the best thing is everyone wins in the relationship.  That's right.  As long as you keep the chicks separate.  So what's the problem?  As long as the two chicks got to know that.  Which one is the problem?  Huh?  Which is the problem?  The whore or the soccer mom is fucking up the system? 
[03:08:30]  Well, there's issues with both of them.  And who sent you to Helix?  The whore or the soccer mom?  We love the whore.  We love our whore.  Sava!  Sava!  You slut!  So we know who the fucking whore is.  Let's just put it this way.  This Helix is a sex toy for the whore.  But the nice girl really wants to get in bed with us.  Right. 
[03:09:00]  But the nice girl, she's laying down the rules.  She will let you lick her asshole, but not fuck her in it.  There's a lot of rules, there's a lot of things that the nice girl's laying down that sometimes  us and the whore are going like, you know.  Stop fucking up our shit.  You know, we're having a good time in bed here.  We want to invite you in for some fun.  But if you keep with these rules, you're not coming into bed with us.  She'll suck your dick, but she won't spit on it.  But she'll actually tell you that.  The whore lives alone, by the way. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  And the soccer mom, there's a lot of other girls around.  Yeah, a lot of other girls around and, you know.  A lot of other corporate bitches.  You shut up.  Look, we're trying here, okay?  You fucking ponies.  You don't really bug me.  Put your innuendo.  Oh, wait.  Fucking tell her name.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Look, Iraq's running in and writing a note.  This can't be good.  Wait, you guys weren't really talking about two chicks?  Oh, shit, Iraq.  What's the whore saying? 
[03:10:00]  What's the whore saying?  Did the pimp call and say to shut the fuck up?  Yo, baby, you got to stop telling your business.  Well, this sucks.  Ron in Vegas.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, dude, they're doing the ball bag bit right now, man.  Have the pests fucking unleash on these bastards.  Do you have a radio and you're listening to it?  Can we get audio for Monday?  Yes.  Can you turn it?  Yes.  Is that possible?  Unfortunately, I'm on my way to the courthouse as an attorney now to defend it.  Can we listen in a little bit? 
[03:10:30]  Hopefully someone's taping this and can send the tape in for us.  Drop, drop, man.  Hello, everybody.  Time to drop, drop.  All right, turn around the other way.  You can't hear this.  You can't hear this.  You can't get some honey.  You've given them a little thing of honey.  Is that it?  Can we get it?  We're trying to stream it.  Greg, we did this crazy, crazy bit a couple weeks ago where we had guys come in.  They got stung in the ball bag by real wasps, bees, yellow jackets. 
[03:11:00]  Never been done on the radio before.  And, well, the rest of the radio has decided it was such a great bit.  They need to do it immediately.  Yeah, that's what happens.  And it's really frustrating.  Don't unhitch.  Just keep it warm.  Okay.  Keep it the stable.  Okay.  Keep the horse the stable.  Yeah.  Why?  Time to drop, drop, man.  Okay, man, show everybody.  Time to drop, drop.  You know, that's just going to drive me nuts.  Hopefully someone get the audio and we'll play it on Monday.  People are hysterical.  It's kind of amazing how that happens.  There's already a huge backlash. 
[03:11:30]  Dude, because, like, in comedy, you guys really take your shit seriously.  And believe it or not, there are radio guys out here that take their shit seriously.  We're not going to play the Howard game where, you know, he invented everything.  But there's guys like Ant and I, and there's a bunch of others out there that do original,  creative bits, and you're proud of it.  And then you, you know, you turn on a radio in Vegas, and these guys are just blatantly  taking your bit, and they have no shame whatsoever.  And no one in Vegas knows where they got it from. 
[03:12:00]  It is so frustrating.  Did you imagine the balls would just sit there and think, I'm just going to steal this?  Right.  In the comedy world, you guys really, you know, beat up the guys that do that.  No.  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  For the most part, you do.  No.  No.  I've talked to other guys, and you guys are dead serious about other people taking your  shit, and you elect other people.  No.  Fucking absolutely not.  Does it go on as much anymore?  I don't even pay attention to them.  Yeah, it goes on so much that no one even cares anymore.  It's like, why even?  Like, it's the same thing with what you're saying. 
[03:12:30]  It's like, you've got no time to get mad at everybody who fucking, you know, because  people go, well, it's too easy to say, no, I invented it.  Right, right.  But you made a point yesterday that summed it up, which is, we didn't invent it, but we invented  it recently.  Well, we did it.  Like, I know some shit I do is like, someone said it.  Well, the mousetrap thing, we did a mousetrap bit, and we made it kind of our own.  I would imagine some radio guy did some kind of mousetrap bit, but we threw our own spin  on it.  It was spawned in originality. 
[03:13:00]  It wasn't spawned in, you know.  Right, but the bee sting thing, I mean, find me the tape.  Find me the tape of someone doing that before.  Jesus, people are pissed.  Why?  Because they really don't know what's going on.  Oh, okay.  And they're just like, speculating and livid, and it's hysterical.  We should have some good info on Monday.  Yeah, don't worry about it, people.  Please.  All they want to know is, who is this tight bitch who ain't giving up no good pussy?  Don't worry.  You know, people, don't worry so much.  We know who the slut is.  All right. 
[03:13:30]  Love our whore.  Want to try some news teases really fast?  Yeah, news teases.  Everywhere in the country, the news is out of control.  Fox News, CNN, they do their news teases.  The locals are the worst.  They try to scare the shit out of you with a little blurb during Seinfeld or something.  Trying to watch a show, have a little fun, and they're telling you your car can kill you,  and they don't tell you what kind of car, no info.  Is the food that your child is eating deadly?  We'll tell you later.  Ha, my kid's eating right now. 
[03:14:00]  I could be killing him.  It's all fear to get you to tune in.  You like this stuff, Greg?  Yeah.  Oh, I love these.  And especially when I get you at the end, and the answer is no.  Is the drinking water killing your kids?  And then at the end, they're like, no, no, actually, it's not.  No, it's not.  We just need to do that.  Yeah.  Nuclear cloud moving into our area?  We'll let you know.  No.  No, we just need to get a watch longer because our ratings are down.  That is kind of amazing.  They can tell you.  If they did have information, it's something your kids could be eating, could be killing them.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't tell you right away.  One thing I heard once was Indian Point nuclear power plant leak. 
[03:14:30]  Are you in danger?  We'll let you know.  And they did the news, and it turned out that it was a leak from a water cooling system  on the generator itself.  It had nothing to do with nuclear stuff.  It's like Bob left his hose spigot on our back.  Yeah.  Can it kill you?  It was that, like, dangerous.  There was no nuclear.  Somehow we've started assuming that the news is supposed to be providing a service, but  it's just entertainment like anything else.  Business, entertainment, ratings, money.  They're not willing to tell us that yet. 
[03:15:00]  That's the problem, you know?  The best is when they involve the kids, too.  Always scary about the kids.  Is your kid playing with a dangerous toy?  We'll tell you at 11.  Are your kids in danger?  Oh, well, thanks.  It'll be so easy to make my kids not play with toys for the next seven hours.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, Dick.  So you can sell some more shampoo.  All right, here we go.  So the latest news to you is the first two are not that bad, and they get pretty ridiculous.  All right, we like that.  Plus, the billboards say everybody does it.  But is it safe to bet what you need to know about wagering on the Super Bowl and if you 
[03:15:30]  could get busted, too?  And it's an ingredient that gives many ethnic foods their taste.  What spice may help fight cancer?  It's a fucking quiz show.  The news has turned into a quiz show.  What is paprika?  What is cumin for $400?  Oh, damn it.  I hope it's curry, man.  Hey, man, I hope it's curry.  I'll take coriander for six.  They can't even leave our Super Bowl alone.  Even people that have no desire to bet will bet on this stupid Super Bowl. 
[03:16:00]  And now they're trying to convince you that you might get caught.  Curry.  Oh, shit.  Damn it.  What liquid from a cow can kill you?  Oh, shit.  Milk?  Oh, no, sorry, that's cows.  Come on, come on.  What's spice?  What's spice?  Is it all spice? 
[03:16:30]  Sorry, that's saffron.  We were looking for saffron.  Damn it.  Saffron.  Isn't this the news?  Hey, by the way, does anyone know the answer to the spice?  Because it was indeed curry.  Oh, there you go.  Curry.  Good.  It bites cancer.  Thank you, Danny.  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  How much curry do you have to eat before it bites the actual cancer?  You shit it out.  You have to live in a silo of fucking curry to drink curry juice and you shit the cancer.  You shit the cancer.  Give me some curry juice.  Shit it out.  Here's the next. 
[03:17:00]  Dipper, dopper.  Shit out the comms.  Here's the next news tease.  Still ahead on Fox 5 News at 10, a massive online identity theft ring broken.  Did they steal your credit card number, how they did it, and what you can do to protect yourself?  Oh, what?  There's too much info there.  That keeps everyone involved.  That one was complicated because it had questions and then it also had like little...  Did they get my number?  Am I safe?  Yeah.  I don't...  I don't know.  I hope they didn't. 
[03:17:30]  Let's go to Rich in Vegas.  Rich?  Yeah, buddy, what's happening?  Hey.  Listen, just wanted to let you know the virus worked, but the bees are dead.  Complete failure.  These jacked off...  The bit completely failed, so they can't even rip off the bit the right way.  They can't do it.  Fucking assholes.  No, the virus worked.  I hope the pests get at those guys at KOMP in Vegas.  Thanks, Rich.  You got it, pal.  Well, that's good news.  But then, of course, they'll try again.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's move on to the next news tease here. 
[03:18:00]  Colds and the flu.  They can knock you out.  But these products promise to beat the bugs.  It helps with my immune system.  This is a wonderful, wonderful product.  What makes them so effective, and who shouldn't take them?  Great.  See, here's something really good, really good, really good.  Some people shouldn't take it.  Great.  They even have to scare you with the good news.  Great.  It's not smoking or drinking or even illegal drugs. 
[03:18:30]  It will tell you what teens are doing at an alarming high rate, and what parents should  look out for.  All right.  I'm going to eliminate some things.  In the time he told you what it isn't, couldn't he tell you what it is?  Yeah.  He told you three things that it isn't.  What is it?  So you know your kids aren't drinking or smoking.  Because if a parent heard that, he would think, you know, something your teens are doing could  hurt them.  Oh, it's probably smoking or drinking or something like that.  Nope.  Nope.  It's not those things.  Don't think you could guess us people. 
[03:19:00]  Not that regular shit you don't know about.  I don't know.  Jerking off.  Yeah.  Was it the choking game?  Probably the choking game.  Honestly, this one, this was pulled before.  I was pulling asses as well.  I know.  It's got to be the choking game.  I think it is.  Because that's all the rage when the kids don't run.  I love the choking game.  What, asphyxiation and jerking off?  Yeah, they're like choking each other out.  It's kind of fun.  It gives you a buzz.  Gets a quick buzz, and then you're supposed to wake up.  But every once in a while, you don't.  Sometimes you die.  Whatever.  It's called thinning the herd.  Oh, well. 
[03:19:30]  Not all the baby turtles make it to the ocean.  And you know niggas ain't doing that shit.  Yo, Troy, nigga, choke me, son.  Yo, motherfucker, just choke my shit until I pass out.  Well, you guys want to hear about hazardous furniture?  Let's go.  What?  Here we go.  The Long Island family comes home to a horrible discovery.  We will open the door and fumes just like, oh, my God, I've knocked this back.  What happened to their house that turned their furniture into hazardous material?  It turned their furniture into hazardous material. 
[03:20:00]  It's a hazardous material.  Like, it was just furniture.  And something happened.  It became hazardous material.  Hazardous material.  How does that happen?  I have the answer for this one, so.  Oh, you do?  When you guys are ready.  All right, let me think.  Thermo-nuclear fusion.  Yeah, what could possibly turn your furniture into hazardous?  I'm going to guess some kind of swamp monster.  It can't be so simple as to involve fire.  No, no fire was involved.  You know, it could have been Jesus.  Jesus.  It was an asbestos lamp. 
[03:20:30]  Turn their furniture into hazardous material.  I can't even.  Okay.  All right.  Was their furniture cleaned?  No.  No.  Fuck.  Is it mold?  No, it is not mold.  It's not mold.  Is it?  This is fun.  What is it?  What could possibly turn your furniture into some kind of hazardous material?  A pet peeing on it?  Nope.  That's really bad.  Done.  Nope.  No.  Oh, but you paused.  That was good. 
[03:21:00]  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  Nothing to do with that.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Some type of, did it involve someone else coming into the house?  Almost, sort of, kind of, in a weird way.  In a weird way.  Something?  Yes.  An animal?  No.  All right.  Radon gas.  No.  No.  What the hell?  I know it's a tough one.  Something, someone.  It wasn't cigarette smoke or anything like that.  No.  Was it someone cleaning the furniture? 
[03:21:30]  No, no cleaning.  No cleaning involved.  No cleaning involved.  This is just boggling my mind.  It's ridiculous.  When you hear the answer, it's, like, the stupidest thing.  Hazardous.  We're ready.  All right.  Danny, what is it?  Basically, this home had a oil valve that just didn't go anywhere.  And when they called for their oil delivery, the guy went to the wrong valve and just pumped  gallons upon gallons of pure, you know, heating oil into their basement.  Into their basement.  And it was basically because it was just a pipe.  They showed you, you know, on the screen.  It was a pipe that just went nowhere.  It just went into the basement and then stopped. 
[03:22:00]  What's a lifetime thing?  It's an epidemic.  Yeah, really.  It's like originating.  Who is that actually happening to?  It didn't happen to you.  What's the stupid oil guy just pumping?  What?  It's a big tank.  I think this guy's got a 50 billion gallon oil tank.  They did the news tease just so motherfuckers who live in three, four walk-ups can still  listen about what the fuck's going on.  And how did that involve furniture?  Because it was like a finished basement.  So all this whole.  Oh, okay.  So all the furniture.  All right.  Thank you, Ben. 
[03:22:30]  It didn't.  The problem is not that it turned their furniture into hazardous material.  No.  It's buried.  And what their furniture, it's, yeah, the oil on the floor.  It's the hazard.  It's not the fact that, oh, my God.  Don't pour skunk juice on the couch.  And that was New York, too, right?  Yeah.  That was definitely Long Island.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's nothing else happening in the world we need to worry about.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's get to the next news tease here.  Jesus.  You heat, you stir.  Could this leave something sinister behind in your body? 
[03:23:00]  There's a lot of things that you buy that you don't really suspect that have these things  in it.  Environmentalists say there's a hidden danger in pots, pans, and even clothes you use every  day.  Once it's in our blood, it never breaks down.  Aren't they right?  Stirring up trouble.  Tuesday on the 10 o'clock news.  Stirring up trouble.  Stirring up trouble.  Pork shampoo.  Is it pot luck what you're putting inside your body? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, that's stirring up trouble.  Yeah, that's so much more dangerous than the greasy mess you're making in that pot.  Is cooking turning the danger up to high?  They always got to tie it in with some bullshit.  You'll be broiling mad when you hear this cooking story.  All right, we get it, idiot.  The worst thing is that some of these things really are kind of creepy, the chemical stuff,  but they're not trying to get any attention and really get things changed. 
[03:24:00]  It's just freaking you out.  It's just trying to freak you out and make it seem like it's happening everywhere to  everybody.  Very scary, ominous music behind that one, too.  It's a movie trailer.  All right, let's go to the next one here.  The answer to a dieter's prayers.  A pill that lets you eat what you want and not pack on the pounds.  And you could soon get it over the counter.  An important warning and the one serious side effect you should know about.  Great, thanks. 
[03:24:30]  AIDS.  Right, thanks.  Doesn't it sound all great?  Pill?  Weight loss?  What's up?  Oh, God, I knew it.  You've got to be a hidden danger.  We got the commercial for the pill, actually.  Oh, is it?  Oh, yeah, we got it right here.  You can lose weight, but you shit your stomach out.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite, so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy. 
[03:25:00]  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Robert Reed used AIDS to lose weight.  Celebrity endorsement.  Oh, man.  How bad was that naming decision by that company?  Whoops.  Look, it's with a Y, okay?  Nah, sorry.  No, but you know, that commercial was pre-AIDS. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's a real commercial or something?  Yeah, that was for...  That was a real commercial in 1982.  There were these chocolate appetite suppressants named A-Y-D-S.  They were AIDS.  That was the AIDS diet plan.  You'd take this chocolate, and it would ruin your appetite.  And, boy, it sure shot the shit out of that.  You think back in, like, there was a guy with a covered wagon with an elixir.  Here, take cancer.  Cancer cures everything.  And then all of a sudden, he's like, fuck, man.  Why'd you name it that?  That was very cool. 
[03:26:00]  We got the focus group.  We got a lot of names.  One, okay, who chooses AIDS?  Raise your hand.  I love it.  Who chooses weight loss pills?  Take a male.  That fucking sucks.  AIDS.  It AIDS you in dieting.  It's a diet aid.  Why not just call it AIDS?  That's wonderful.  Hey, speaking of the pill, what's the side effect on the real pill?  Oh, what was it?  The diet.  The world will never know because.  Again.  It was one I pulled before you guys wanted answers for.  Well, it fits much better with the answers. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, we like the answers, Danny.  Every one that I pull from this point on will have answers.  Answer, Danny.  Answer.  Answers.  What a fun show today.  It was definitely enjoyable.  It went very quickly, and now it's just not over.  Hey, what happened to the guy with the stuff in the pee hole?  PalTalk was screwing up so badly, we'll probably wind up doing that.  Can the guy wait until Monday, or is he going to do it?  He'll do it for everybody over the weekend, but he's got to do it for the radio audience on Monday.  Yeah, do it for everybody else.  Feel free, and then we'll have him on.  Is that him?  Ah, ah, ah, ow, ow. 
[03:27:00]  There you go.  Oh, okay, he's doing it.  Holy shit, stop it.  There you go.  What is he shoving in his pee hole?  A thermometer.  That's a, it's one of those thick, oh my God.  Thermometers.  He gets himself all worked up.  What is that?  What is that?  It's a screwdriver.  It's a screwdriver.  Oh, God.  What a way to end another great week of broadcasting.  Ow, why do you do that?  Thank you, Marconi, thank you. 
[03:27:30]  Greg Giraldo, do you have anything to promote?  It's a nail.  No, man, well, it's just a Friday night show on Friday Central starting in April.  Cool.  Well, we'll have you back before that.  What the hell is that?  It's a nail.  That's a thick nail.  Patrice O'Neal, thank you so much.  We'll see you tomorrow night.  Program complete. </pre>
