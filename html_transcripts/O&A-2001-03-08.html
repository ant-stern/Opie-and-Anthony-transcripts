<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between shocking segments and humorous anecdotes.  The show opened with a discussion of a female guest, Erin, who requested and received multiple slaps to the face from Jim Norton.  Audio of the slaps was played on-air, sparking debate among the hosts and callers about the act's shock value and entertainment.  The hosts apologized for significant technical difficulties the previous day which resulted in lost segments of the show.  They also discussed censored content, citing the email address "tinkledrinker@aol.com" as an example.  This segment also included a discussion of a woman who set herself on fire while smoking in an oxygen tent, prompting numerous caller anecdotes about unusual fetishes and bizarre incidents.  A brief mention of an upcoming interview with FHM Magazine was also made.  The segment concluded with a caller impersonating Carlos Mencia.

The show then transitioned to a series of caller stories detailing encounters with dead bodies in various locations, often with graphic descriptions of decomposition.  This segued into a discussion of a disturbing videotape showing post-mortem sexual acts and the website BudDwyer.com, which sells merchandise related to the suicide of Bud Dwyer.  Another caller's story about face-slapping as a sexual practice prompted a discussion about the psychology of such preferences, with a brief appearance by a psychologist.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a phone call with Vince McMahon, who brainstormed outlandish and violent ideas for increasing XFL ratings, including landmines, sniper rifles, bear traps, cocaine-selling cheerleaders, and on-field coach executions.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of *Jackass*, focusing on graphic stunts and caller reactions.  Michael from *Survivor* then called in, recounting his experiences, including severe burns, a controversial pig hunt (with accusations of drugging the pig), and the lack of sexual activity among contestants.  He also commented on other contestants' appearances.  This segment included a humorous story about their short general manager, Bruce Mittman, having to present a large check to the Minority Homeless Veterans Association and his use of the derogatory term "shwuggies."  The hosts also recounted a prank where a caller pretended to be gay to his mother, the subsequent backlash from a gay rights organization, and an awkward meeting mediated by their boss who used homophobic slurs.  Finally, they detailed a stunt where they were hit with golf balls while wearing hockey gear and frying pan crotch protection.

A later segment featured another recounting of Michael's *Survivor* experience, including his burn injury and treatment involving a possibly drug-laced kazoo.  The majority of this segment focused on a prank where Opie and Anthony falsely announced the death of Boston's mayor.  The resulting fallout included a disastrous PR attempt involving their "midget" general manager, Dada Dave, and 500 pies intended as a public apology, ultimately delivered to a children's cancer hospital.  The hosts refused to participate in a photo opportunity with the mayor, resulting in their firing.  This story was laden with offensive language and listener calls added further anecdotes and offensive humor. The show concluded with a promotion for MafiaMob.com.

Ben rocking today.  Good morning, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  Ben did a great job with the music today.  We just ran from upstairs, Anthony.  Yes.  Good morning.  Sorry, go ahead. 
[00:02:00]  Another interview.  Yeah, I didn't realize how late it was.  We just got out of an interview with FHM Magazine.  Yes.  We were just talking about FHM Magazine the other day.  Yeah, they were the one that did the top 20 vehicles.  And the Voyeur bus was in there, number 16.  And now we just did an interview with her.  Pretty good.  And here we are.  We look good.  He didn't ask us the how did you two get together question.  Yeah, we made fun of that with him. 
[00:02:30]  It's like everybody asks all the time.  I'm all effed up, though.  We finished, what, five minutes ago and here we are on the air?  Yeah, kind of ran in.  Like, dude, we got a show to do, man.  All right, 212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Where do we begin today, Anthony?  My God, I'm just trying to get all my webpages up.  I guess we could start with an apology.  Waddle doodle-y. 
[00:03:00]  I apologize-y.  What are we apologizing for?  We want to apologize for the end of yesterday's show.  Oh.  Yeah.  Turns out no one understood what was going on because the show was getting dumped out so much.  That was a flobey abortion.  Yesterday's the end of the show.  We were having fun.  We were listening to cool stories here in the studio.  But what the listeners heard, I don't know what that was. 
[00:03:30]  It was like you put a tape of the show and some razor blades in a blender and then you start it up.  And then whatever pieces fly out of the blender, that's probably what you heard.  Yeah, we were having a lot of fun.  And then we get the feedback from our faithful listeners and stuff going,  dudes, we don't know what you were talking about during the show because it was all choppy and stuff.  Yeah, it was all cut up.  We didn't know.  We put our show on puree. 
[00:04:00]  O&A puree.  Well, we had a good time.  Yeah, and then we see the list because we get a list of everything that was dumped out of from the show.  Of course, they give it to us the next day.  Ex post facto.  And there was a lot of stuff dumped out of that really didn't need to be dumped.  Really didn't need.  The word tinkle was dumped out of our show.  Yes.  You're allowed to say tinkle on the radio. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, you can say tinkle.  Tinkle.  And you're allowed to say tinkle drinker.  Yeah.  That's happened to be Jim Norton's website.  Email address.  His email address.  Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  Email him.  Serious emails only.  No, I'm kidding.  We like noise.  Yeah, so a lot of stuff is just like totally cut out.  Maybe we'll rerun it one of these days. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, we'll rerun it.  We rerun everything on our show.  We certainly do.  We love it.  All right.  So we don't know what it sounded like at the end of yesterday's show, but we feel like  we've got to apologize.  A chick had some wild stories.  She had some incredible stories.  God.  Do we have the audio of her getting slapped?  That is fantastic.  Rick, you've got to get that.  We've got to replay that because that was deeply disturbing yesterday.  A girl enjoyed getting slapped.  Erin.  She enjoyed getting slapped. 
[00:05:30]  So Jim Norton, of course, the resident lunatic, he obliged and put the mic near her head  and slapped her in the face a couple of times.  I was horrified.  I was horrified.  Leave it to Norton, though.  Oh, wait.  Manny's got an observation.  Manny, what's going on?  Manny!  Hello.  He hung up.  All right.  He was going to say that the stuff we just complained about didn't get dumped out of. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I know.  But that's crap because we saw the stuff that got dumped out of.  No, he's saying today, I think.  Oh, like we just said, Tinkle Drinker, now it's on the air today.  Of course it's on the air because you're allowed to say that.  We had to straighten some people out today when we got into work.  Tinkle Drinker wasn't dumped on.  I heard it when Norton gave the address.  Yeah, because I think he ran out of dump at that point.  It was dumped like five times.  But then he was able to say it.  Anyway, back to the girl.  Aaron.  I think they went out last night. 
[00:06:30]  Aaron and Norton?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll get details.  When I was leaving, they were just sitting in the office having a little chat, a little talk.  Tackin', tackin', tackin'.  Sitting in the chairs.  Two chairs pulled up real close to each other.  I noticed that.  Now, Larry's saying they heard all that stuff yesterday.  Larry!  Hello.  Hey, buddy.  How you doing?  Good.  I got that on the radio, all for except about the last 15 minutes or so, and the Tinkle  Drinker, his email address, that all made it out there. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  How do you know you heard everything if it was dumped?  Well, you were saying they dumped his email address.  Right.  Five times.  They dumped it five times.  I think you only said it five times.  So, you're saying they dumped it the first couple times and then let it through?  So, you're saying now, all right, maybe this is going to bore everyone.  You're saying that Tinkle Drinker made the air yesterday.  Yes, it did.  All right.  Thank you, Larry. 
[00:07:30]  It's easy to say everything you're talking about went out over the air, but it did.  We know.  We saw the list.  We saw the sheet.  We saw the list.  When she said she was, that Norton and his roommate would put a tarp down at Norton's  house to catch her blood.  That got dumped.  During our erotic Price is Right game, when I said that prize is supplied by Dicker and  Dicker of Beverly Hills. 
[00:08:00]  There's really a Dicker and Dicker of Beverly Hills, but for some reason he felt compelled  to dump out Dicker and Dicker of Beverly Hills.  What about the gas in the face thing?  Right.  Past gas in the face was dumped out of.  You could say that.  It's a little disgusting, but you're allowed to say it on the radio.  Sure.  Anyway, that's something we had to deal with today.  It came in the ass.  It wasn't fun.  No. 
[00:08:30]  Let's go to Pat.  Pat, what's going on?  Yeah, cool.  Pat, you're on the radio.  Yeah, hey, man.  Hey.  I box, man.  I used to box.  I don't hit guys that hard as hard as he hit Aaron yesterday, man.  That was something else.  Yeah, let's get back to that.  He really did.  He's getting off on it, too.  It was.  You know, we've seen a lot of sick stuff in this studio.  That was twisted yesterday.  Yeah, she seems to be getting off on it, too, man.  She was.  She was saying harder, harder.  And Norton, like, he'd be rubbing her cheek, like, rubbing it, rubbing it, rubbing it. 
[00:09:00]  And then, and then without even any notice, he'd be rubbing, rubbing it, and whack.  Just snap her in the face.  Yeah.  If you didn't hear that yesterday, stick around.  We're going to play it as soon as Rick has it ready.  But I was on the subway platform after the show last night thinking to myself, did I finally  find my limit?  Did I finally find my edge?  Because I was deeply disturbed after the show ended.  I'm like.  I was digging it.  I was digging it.  Wait, wait, wait.  I was totally digging it.  I can't believe this is on the radio.  This is great.  Wait, you were digging her getting slapped in the face really hard?  Not like a little uptap? 
[00:09:30]  That was cool.  It was like, bam!  Believe it.  Yeah.  It was cool because she liked it and wanted it done to her.  That's why it was cool to watch.  Just the way she said, oh.  I don't like, you know, I wouldn't like some guy walking up to a girl and just smacking  her in the face.  No, but she was into it.  That's a thing.  She was into it.  It was kind of cool to watch.  I understand she was into it, but it was just, it was deeply disturbing to watch.  Well, yeah, but that's why it was cool to watch.  Yeah.  It's one of those, you talk about it, the freak fact.  I mean, there are girls that are into cutting themselves. 
[00:10:00]  Would you want to watch that?  If she's into it, I'd watch it.  Nah, I don't want to watch that.  I'd watch that.  If she was into it, you know what cutting is, right?  With the blades and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do it all the time.  I'm a cutter.  I know somebody that used to do it all the time.  A Lifetime Afternoon Special.  I was going to say, you're going to be on the next Lifetime movie?  The movie about the cutter.  Remember that show?  I forgot who was in it, but there was a daughter and she was cutting herself and cutting it from  the family.  Yeah, I saw that.  I saw part of it.  It might have been Seventh Heaven.  Yeah, maybe. 
[00:10:30]  All right, Pat.  I'm from Huntington, guys.  You guys are from out this way, right?  Yes.  I hope he is, yes.  Cool.  All right, Pat.  Listen, I've got to run, man.  Good talk to you.  I'll email you later.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, bud?  Hey, buddy.  If you were so disturbed yesterday, how come you kept telling Norton to do it one more  time?  I don't know.  Right here?  I've got to say, I was disturbed in the studio, and then when I was on the platform, I'm like,  man, maybe that went a little too far.  Oh, an afterthought?  You're right, though.  I was the one who said, I want to see that one more time. 
[00:11:00]  Do it again.  I think because I couldn't believe I was watching what I was watching.  And not only that, I remember this now.  Oak said, yeah, why don't you smack her one more time?  And she goes, oh, yeah, the other cheek of my butt.  And she gets ready to, like, have Norton slap her butt.  And Oak goes, no, no, the face.  And then she said, I enjoy that more anyway.  So, yeah, she liked it.  And you're right.  I don't know why I asked to see it again, but I'm just telling you, when I was waiting  for my little train last night, I'm like, man, that was just out. 
[00:11:30]  It's one of those things that you don't normally see.  So, when you see it, it's kind of cool.  I didn't know how to take it.  I mean, you see two lesbians on the couch that, you know, two girls that don't know each other  and they're going out for the first time.  You can understand why that's kind of cool.  I'm like, all right, I'd love to see that over and over again.  But yesterday, it was like, God, I don't know.  Thanks, Steve.  All right, boys, Steve.  All right.  Pretty wild.  Let me go to Will.  Will, what's up, buddy?  You know, the best thing about that, Opie, was listening to Anthony get off on it. 
[00:12:00]  He was so funny when he was like, uh, Norton, punch her in the face.  And then he's like, can we stab you?  He was up and out of control.  He was getting off on it.  At that point, I just wanted Norton to beat the crap.  You know, Anthony, you think I like that six stuff.  Remember the girl with the knives?  You're like, listen to me carefully.  Drive the knife in her chest.  Yeah, you know, come on.  Take it to the extreme.  All right, Will, thank you. 
[00:12:30]  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, you're next on NAW.  You guys are the best, man.  Hey.  The best.  Listen, I don't know why you didn't get more stories out of her.  We did.  We got a lot.  A lot of them were dumped out of at the end there.  She never got her threesome story in, did she?  Oh, she'll be back.  She had the threesome thing.  Wasn't that the one with the yam thing?  The guy?  Yeah.  It was technically a threesome.  I mean, one guy couldn't, are we allowed to say ball cancer today?  That got dumped out of yesterday. 
[00:13:00]  It's okay today.  Which was the best part of the story yesterday.  Yeah.  One of the guys had ball cancer, so he couldn't, you know.  He couldn't participate in the threesome.  Participate in the threesome.  But the one guy that did, you know, and then she said yam, and it was all over after that.  It would have been a foursome if he would have participated, but he couldn't.  So it was Aaron, this chick, and then a dancer, a male dancer.  And the male dancer then asked to have her do things on him. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Hey, don't forget about spam chunks.  Yeah.  Spam chunks made her through?  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Bill.  Guy having sex with a chick.  And then in the bed after she left, the only residue that they could find was what they  called spam chunks.  How is a girl leaving spam chunks?  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to know if Anthony and Norton had a feeling like doing De Niro and Pesci on  bats to this girl, like in Goodfellas. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, get the bats out.  When they were hitting him in the bar, I didn't mean to get blood on your floor, Opie.  All right, Joe, thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  All right, John's saying earn is every man's dream.  Yeah, don't I?  John, explain yourself.  Yeah, yeah.  That woman is every guy's dream.  What other woman?  Number one, a woman was put on this earth to do two things, to give us pleasure and to  aggravate us.  After she aggravates you, you can hit her and she likes it. 
[00:14:30]  Is that the best of what?  Well, I think she would have to ask to be hit, so she's aggravating you and you just  smack her.  She might not like it.  But, although, who the hell am I to say?  Maybe she does like it.  Definitely.  All right.  Hey, have a good day, man.  You guys are the best.  Thank you, John.  Take care.  All right, Anthony, we're going to take a break.  All right.  Rick's going to have the clips of her getting smacked.  Ready.  That's what we want to hear.  And we're going to play them next.  So, this one's going to be a quick break, so stay there.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. 
[00:15:00]  Dave wants in real fast here.  We've got the clips of her and we're going to play in a second.  Dave, what's up?  Yo, so this girl is every man's worst nightmare.  Well, the guy before you...  If you piss off on being smacked, she's going to piss you off all the time.  Well, there's a way to look at it, huh?  She kind of likes it.  I thought Anthony would appreciate that.  Very good.  Well, I grew up in Centerport.  I listen to you guys all the time.  You roll.  Hey, that's where I'm from.  Centerport. 
[00:15:30]  There you go.  Look at that.  I live in Jersey now, but I lived in Centerport all through until I was like 10 years old.  Nothing better than the smell of bunker backing up in Centerport Harbor.  I lived right off of the mill dam.  Ah, the smell of fish.  The smell of summer.  Oh, it's right.  Thanks, you guys roll.  Better, man.  All right.  So, Anthony, we've got the clips.  Yeah, I've got to hear this now because it's one thing to be here and hear it and see it live. 
[00:16:00]  But I want to hear what the listeners heard.  Hear what this sounds like.  You want to set this up real fast?  This smacking.  Oh, Erin.  Erin, this sex-crazed girl.  My God.  Had a bunch of those stories growing up about rape fantasies and whatnot.  And then we found out yesterday she likes being slapped.  Some girls like being spanked, which is fine.  A lot of girls do, I think.  A little playful spanking.  But she likes being smacked in the face.  Hard.  And Jim Norton was here.  And what a love connection those two made.  And Jim smacked her in the face, as per her instructions. 
[00:16:30]  That's about it.  Let's go.  He smacked her in the face.  All right, hold on, hold on.  You're going to get off on this?  I like it.  You like it.  You better make a sound, baby.  All right, hold on.  Get the mic close.  Put the mic close.  Turn her head.  That's a beautiful face, though.  That was a nice one.  Oh!  Oh!  I slapped me!  Oh, God!  I slapped me!  That's a winner!  You like that?  I love that. 
[00:17:00]  She liked being smacked, Opie.  By the way, her pictures are up on www.com.  Oh, they are.  Under the Opie and Anthony section.  Just go to Erin.  She's a good-looking broad.  Let's see pictures of Erin.  Here they are.  All right, Anthony.  We've got a second clip.  More of the same.  Here it is.  This is the ass.  Oh, this is the ass?  All right.  A lot of people can understand the ass.  I mean, the whole smacking of the face is just beyond twisted. 
[00:17:30]  All right, go ahead.  Oh, you like the smack on the ass?  Oh, look at that boot.  Hey, hey, hey.  Right-handed, buddy.  Run this way.  Run this way.  That'll even mark.  Get a good...  You're hitting her hip.  Trust me.  Pull that down.  There you go.  This is legal, isn't it?  It's right.  It's just...  No, this is just...  Jim.  No cameras.  All right, no cameras.  Steve, you're going to ruin it.  No cameras.  I won't even mark the picture.  All right, the camera's down.  Okay.  We're done with cameras.  All right, the camera's done.  Let her hold the camera so she feels...  There we go.  Get rid of that camera. 
[00:18:00]  Harder.  Harder.  Harder.  Oh, wow.  That was hard enough.  Hold.  Let's see the handprint.  Cold cheese is cold.  Cold cheese is cold.  She likes it.  What can we say?  She likes it.  So we didn't stop there.  I decided I needed to see the face thing again.  Yeah, Opie had to see her getting smacked in the face.  I had to see it again because I couldn't believe I was checking that out, and after 
[00:18:30]  the show, I felt pretty bad.  You did?  Man, it was twisted.  Does Steve have the video of that?  Yeah.  It's up on FoundryMusic.com?  Get Steve in here.  We've got to make sure people know exactly where you're going to find the video.  Rick and that's up on OldFoundryMusic.com.  Here comes Steve.  Hold on a second.  Just in case you want to see the video of this.  I don't think I would ever see that again.  Big Kev, you're right. 
[00:19:00]  Where would you go?  It's not every day you see a girl getting slapped really hard in the face because she  enjoys it.  All right.  Well, we'll play the clip, and then Steve will be in here.  But here it is.  Aaron from yesterday getting slapped in the face again.  Norton, make a full fist.  Wind up and punch your teeth out.  I'm leaving here with his rosy cheeks and with Norton.  Jim, come on.  Norton, kick her in the face.  Look at the look, Jim, Jim.  This is so wrong.  This is so effing wrong.  Jim, wait, wait, wait.  Calm down. 
[00:19:30]  Rick, look out.  I've got to see this.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Harder, harder.  Back it up a little bit.  I want to do it short.  Oh, God.  One more.  One more.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Woo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Can we stab you?  Why not?  It's going that far.  That's not too outrageous.  Come on.  After what we saw yesterday. 
[00:20:00]  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Do you have video of her getting slapped in the face?  I have video of Jim Norton smacking her face.  Yeah, but from the back, so there's no actual face in the shot.  Very creatively captured on film.  You can still see that it's a pretty good shot to the face?  Absolutely.  Yeah, you just see, like, Jim wind up and bang.  I've got to say, I went to Foundry, and I found it right away.  How is that possible? 
[00:20:30]  I know.  Isn't it amazing?  Steve, I like the new design on the website.  Thank you.  I love it.  I understand.  We put the big links on the page.  I put a lot of hours into it.  You know, but now there's big links.  There we go.  Click here.  There it is.  There it is.  Nice.  Simple, easy to use.  That's right on the front page.  Big links right on the front page.  It'll take you right to the cliffs.  Beautiful.  Thanks, Jeff, for making it easy.  So easy.  Devin, what's going on? 
[00:21:00]  Kevin, you mean?  Kevin, what's up, buddy?  Is it O&A?  Yeah.  Okay.  Listen, I don't understand.  All these people call in with these fetishes, and, you know, I like being smacked across the  face, but, you know, how did they finally get to this point?  You know, they must have gone through hell before they finally said, okay, this is the thing  I like.  You know, that's a great question.  I don't know if we'll find the answer today.  I mean, how does it come to the point where you enjoy getting smacked in the face real  hard, and it turns you on? 
[00:21:30]  Or anything else.  Like, come on, they must have gone through a lot of X, you know, before they finally  said, okay, this is what does it for me.  I don't understand the simple fetish, the foot fetish.  Don't understand it.  Yeah.  Don't get it.  There are guys and ladies that just get completely off on feet.  I don't understand it.  I like it as part of your total nude woman package.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I wouldn't like a girl without feet.  You know, I love the harsh, freaky thing about all of it, but, you know, you've got to wonder, 
[00:22:00]  I mean, is this the girl you're going to marry?  I don't think so.  You know, as the whole package.  Package, right.  You kind of like that.  But guys that just concentrate on the feet, that's a little weird.  You get that, um, the guys that like the smell of stinky feet on chicks and stuff.  Like I said, like I said, I read a penthouse forum once years ago.  There was a guy who was in prison for, uh, like eight years. 
[00:22:30]  And he would have to, you know, jack a lot.  It's the only thing you got going in there.  And he got so used to cranking it while he was laying on the upper bunk over the back end of his bed.  Um, and the smell of his cellmate's stinky feet would waft up.  And the only way he could, uh, uh, do it after he got out of prison was to have smelly man's socks over his face. 
[00:23:00]  And that letter?  From Rick Delgado.  Yes.  Little known fact?  Little known fact.  Bob, what's up?  What's going on, man?  You've got to see if Steve can put in those little bubbles, like on blind dates for the video.  You know, like date turns cool in three, two, one, type of thing.  That's right.  Yeah, and then you should see, maybe, you know, we can have an after date, you know, interview, see how it went with, uh, Norton, you know.  That's a good idea.  It sounds pretty cool.  Wouldn't it be funny if Norton came back with just the, the crap beat out of him? 
[00:23:30]  Comes back with a cane, a head bandage, you know.  Right.  Bleeding from the nose.  All right, Bob, thank you.  Take care, man.  We talk about fetishes from time to time on our show.  One of the greatest fetishes ever that we discovered the last time we talked,  guys that enjoy getting stung on their, uh, on their junk by a bee.  On their junk.  Something we were going to do on this radio show, and, uh, and we were told we can't do it.  Shut down. 
[00:24:00]  Shut down.  Remember?  Yeah, guys that we were going to, uh, have a jar with bees in it,  and guys would have to put their junk in the bee jar.  And, uh, whoever got stung first won a prize.  It was supposed to be that famous Aztec.  Oh, is that what it was for?  That was for the Aztec.  The non-existent Aztec?  That's another reason why the, the, the bit never happened.  I think we could have talked the bosses into doing it if we had a prize like an Aztec.  If we actually had the Aztec.  Probably one of the ugliest vehicles on the face of the Earth. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, isn't that a creepy noise?  Oh, that is horrible.  Remember when you used to catch a bee?  You ever go catching bees when you were a kid?  You catch bees in, like, a Hellman's jar.  And you would put your ear up to the, um, to the top of the jar and hear that exact sound.  It was like the hunt for a kid.  You know, you were hunting, and there was an element of danger in it.  And, uh, you'd have to, like, stalk the bait, hold the lid in the jar, 
[00:25:00]  just crack it open a little, and grab him real quick.  And if you missed, and he came chasing you, you did that bee is chasing me dance down the street,  bleh, with your arms, well, I am so scared, assless, of bees,  that, um, if, if I didn't catch him, and he started chasing me,  I swear I would run a quarter mile down the road doing the bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bee chasing me dance.  That was great about that contest.  We were going to have four or five guys with the bee and the jar, the junk in the jar. 
[00:25:30]  You know, the, the guy who really wanted to win the Aztec would have to really just piss off the bee,  so he'd be shaking the, the darn everything.  Yeah, he'd shake it up, get him all pissed off really quick,  and then you'd have to put your junk in the jar.  Insane.  And hopefully the bee would sting it.  Uh, Aaron.  Hi.  And Rick would suck out the poison.  This is our, our...  Ah, he's throwing stuff at me.  Come on, after yesterday's, uh, contest idea, Rick.  Suck out the poison.  It hasn't settled yet.  No, doctor says you're going to die. 
[00:26:00]  Aaron, Aaron's our latest find on the O&A show.  Hello.  Here she is again.  I'm calling your response to the guy saying, how does it get to that point?  Yeah.  Like, I was certainly by no means abused.  I had a very nice childhood.  How it got to the slapping point is once I was fighting with an ex of mine,  we were arguing, he smacked me across the face,  I pretended to get pissed off, but I was actually very turned on.  Um, and that's when I realized I liked getting smacked across the face. 
[00:26:30]  Hmm.  How are...  How are your cheeks today?  Are they bruised or red or something?  Um, no.  They're all right?  Yeah, they're all right.  Okay.  Oh, and by the way, those are the worst pictures I've ever seen of myself in my life.  I wanted to throw my computer out the window.  Well, we can retake them someday.  Can you take them off there?  They're horrible.  I got two of my friends called me, and they were like,  oh my God, those are the worst pictures we've ever seen.  Oh, really?  Those are horrible.  Ladies are never happy with the pictures we take of them. 
[00:27:00]  I have people calling me saying,  you look, I've never seen you look worse.  Wow, really?  Yes.  Why is that?  One of my good friends called me from work.  He said, I've just been trying to be honest.  I've never seen a worse picture of you in my life.  Why did they say it was bad?  I don't know.  All right.  Did you see Norton last night?  Yeah.  And?  He was very funny.  We had a good time.  Anything happen?  We had a late night.  I never kiss and tell, 
[00:27:30]  especially when you know who the other party involved is.  There you go.  There I go.  Safe to say something may have gone down last night?  I mean, you like to use your imaginations if you choose to.  Use our imaginations.  Blah, blah, blah.  Let me use our imaginations.  Blah, blah.  I'm sure you will use your imaginations.  Nick Norton, very funny?  Yes, he is very funny.  Is he a hunk?  I don't know.  Were you doing some neck exercises?  Neck exercises? 
[00:28:00]  Were you like a robin trying to pull a worm out of the ground?  I don't think so.  All right.  Well, we'll let you go for now, all right?  Okay.  Later, guys.  Here's Erin.  Oh, Erin's slappy.  You see?  Yeah, I know.  We'll get into that next.  Yeah, that's great.  We'll get into that story next, Anthony.  And Bob...  Hold on.  Let me make sure he stays.  Bob?  Nope.  Bob, we're coming back with you, so stay there, okay?  Okay, cool, guys.  I just don't want you to go anywhere. 
[00:28:30]  I'm here.  Okay.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Jim Norton.  What's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  Uh, Rick just called me.  He said they were talking about it on the air, so he asked me to call in.  Well, no, I guess Erin went and saw you last night.  We didn't get anything out of her.  Yeah, no, there was nothing to get out of her, man.  Why, did she call in?  Yeah.  No, there was nothing to get out. 
[00:29:00]  We hung out.  She was very bright.  We had a good time, but there was really nothing for her to tell.  You said you were very funny.  Oh, thank you.  I was a complete slob on stage last night.  Were you?  A complete creep.  Why be any different than you usually are?  We like that, though.  Yeah, but no, I wish there was something to get out, but there really wasn't.  It bugged me.  But she was nice to hang out with.  I definitely enjoyed hanging with her.  All right.  We thought there might be a story to tell today.  Maybe there's some assault in the future.  Yeah, no, I'm hoping.  I'm hoping.  I brought something, a little Vaseline to heat up and just coat my hand in for a nice, 
[00:29:30]  good crispy slap, but there was nothing.  Have you seen the video clip of you slapping her yet?  Yeah, I watched part of it yesterday.  It looked pretty awful.  Yeah, huh?  It's, yeah, it's disturbing, then.  Ever see Raging Bull when De Niro's cracking Kathy Moriarty around?  That's what it's all like.  It was great.  That's a great movie.  That is.  Oh, it's amazing.  That's funny.  Some of the greatest moments in film history are slaps.  Yeah.  So, yeah, man, I wish there was a story to tell, but unfortunately it's not.  I went home, whacked my bag again.  Okay.  All right, boys.  Hey, we mentioned you in our little interview today. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, thank you, man.  What's up?  FHM Magazine.  Oh, cool, cool.  We don't know when it's coming out.  These things usually come out, like, I don't know, three or four months later, so.  All right, by then I'll probably be dead, but thank you for mentioning me.  That's great.  Thanks, Jim.  All right, boys.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  All right.  We got to move on to Bob.  Bob, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I don't know if you watched the 6 o'clock news last night, but some tool in the city  decided she was in a bubble in the hospital, I guess, for asthma or something like that. 
[00:30:30]  An oxygen tent.  Yeah, yeah, well, it was an oxygen tank thing, and she decided she was going to light a cigarette,  and she blew the damn thing up.  I don't know if you guys heard about that.  I saw this.  Some nurses had to go into the hospital for a smoke, inhalation.  And how intelligent people, my God.  Well, I think it was on Long Island in East Meadow, I believe.  Really?  What happened was, yeah, she was in one of these oxygen tanks for asthma or something.  Yeah.  And the lady had a cigarette hidden on her body.  Yeah.  She needed to smoke that bad, and she... 
[00:31:00]  I have pneumonia, but I have to smoke.  And she lit up, and boom!  Doesn't everyone know basics in chemistry?  Oxygen, being in an oxygen atmosphere is a little dangerous when fire's involved.  Too many to have no helium, huh?  Well, helium isn't flammable.  No?  Don't you know your chemistry?  No, no, I never took chemistry.  Neither did I, but you know helium's not flammable.  They're not going to give kids balloons full of flammable gas. 
[00:31:30]  Here, kids, here's a hydrogen balloon.  Have fun.  It's called the Hindenburg.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot for me on.  All right.  Take care.  Helium.  Helium, nitrogen, inert gases.  This lady's claiming that her best friend was in the bed next to the bubble lady.  Come on, Lainey.  Yeah, my friend's in the hospital.  She's in Phantasmus.  The Nassau County Medical Center, or whatever they call it now, and the chick in the bed  next to her lit up a cigarette, and they had a fire in the woods. 
[00:32:00]  So did it explode, or it just started a fire?  What happened when the oxygen doesn't explode, Opie?  It is an accelerant.  Thank you.  So it just accelerates the flame.  So if anything catches on fire, it'll just, it'll spread so quickly.  It'll be like a, like a flash.  They had to, they had to change up bed, needless to say.  And the lady was okay?  They lit the cigarette?  Oh, she got, she got burned.  She got burned pretty bad.  That's great.  No, we understand that. 
[00:32:30]  I'm surprised she's alive still.  No, she's still alive.  She needs some frigging medication is what she needs.  And what happened to your best friend?  Oh, she's still there.  She ain't doing so good.  But you know, we're open for the best, you know.  Well, it sure doesn't.  She wants to come out and keep herself something else, I'll tell you that.  It doesn't help when she has to inhale smoke.  That's great.  She's pneumonia in an oxygen tent because she can't breathe, and she's ready to puff.  I can't believe you guys are talking about that.  Oh, all right.  Have a great day, guys. 
[00:33:00]  Lainey, it's a huge story.  I mean, must it look like Backdraft.  Must it look just like Backdraft?  It's just like, you know, you're there visiting your friend  because she's, like, not doing so good.  And then you hear her, like, what's happening in her room being talked about on your show.  How weird is that?  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  I hope your friend does better.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right.  We got an electrician that was at the hospital, Anthony.  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Speak.  Turn off your goddamn radio.  What? 
[00:33:30]  All right.  Listen, guys.  I guess we haven't said it in a while.  Maybe it has been a while.  If you're on hold for the radio show, you've got to turn down your radio.  You've got to.  It's a 40-second delay.  Turn it down.  It really Fs up the program bad.  Eric.  Yeah.  Turn down your radio, okay?  It's not even on.  It was on.  I heard it.  We heard it.  But what do you have for the show?  No, you should have seen it.  It was such a fiasco in the morning when this thing all lit up.  About 45 firemen go bust it up. 
[00:34:00]  They're like, the whole hospital's on fire.  I've never seen them evacuate a place so fast in my life.  That's got to be rough, evacuating a hospital.  Oof.  Especially there with the intensive care ward.  Wasn't that what she was in?  Right.  It was in the ICU.  Oh.  Yeah.  Imagine some poor son of a bitch, you want to go in there, you're dying of something,  you're in intensive care, and some stupid twat lights a friggin' cigarette in an oxygen  tent.  And here comes a flame.  Oh, this is great.  Coming right for us.  Yeah.  I can't even quickly move and jump somewhere to run away from it or something. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you.  You live through the car wreck or the heart attack or the reason you're in there.  You feel like you're safe, okay?  For some dumb bitch to light a friggin' cigarette because she doesn't understand basic chemistry.  I'm in ICU.  Everything's going to be okay.  I'm going to survive this.  Kathy.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, am I on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen, you've got to talk.  This woman was arrested after she blew up that room because she had barbitious in her 
[00:35:00]  panties.  Come on.  She did.  Did she have stash panties?  She had the stash panties working.  Doing a little ex?  I'm telling you, that's what.  She was arrested after she did that.  Kathy, come on.  How can we prove that?  That was on the news last night.  That part was on the news, too?  What kind of barbiturates?  I don't know.  That they didn't say.  No?  That they didn't say.  I'm just telling you.  So, she had a barbiturate there.  They were in her stash panties there.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  Barbiturates in the panties.  This story's getting better, Anthony.  This woman is too much.  Brian, what's going on? 
[00:35:30]  How you doing?  My wife works at the Massachusetts Center.  Yeah.  And she actually took care of the lady who burned the cell.  Okay.  She found the pills in her bed.  Pills?  Pills.  She didn't know what they were.  You know, they're not marked, obviously.  But, yeah, she found the pills.  The lady didn't get burned too bad.  It was the oxygen tube kind of melted to her face.  Stupid bitch.  All right.  Thank you, man.  That is very funny.  You stupid bitch. 
[00:36:00]  I love when people are stupid.  Businesses kicks them in the ass.  Stupidity rocks.  I hear this girl likes being slapped.  Laying there.  Norton's going to date her.  Set her on fire.  Gene, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  Hey, good.  I was just going to tell you that the cops are thinking of pressing charges against that lady that lit the cigarette.  Well, obviously they should press charges.  Yeah.  Man, she's an idiot.  She's brain dead.  She was probably brain dead before. 
[00:36:30]  I just wanted to let you know.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  Anthony, we got some audio of the lady.  Oh, really?  That kind of, you know, set herself on fire with that oxygen cigarette thing.  I got thought of a kind of brain.  I knew I was going to get to this point.  Peter.  Hey, I'm a cook in the hospital, man.  We're all listening to you.  Yeah.  Listen, I just wanted to fill you in on what that dumb broad had this morning for breakfast, man. 
[00:37:00]  I knew I was going to get to this.  Yeah, she had scrambled eggs, fruit juice, toast with strawberry preserves, and a cup of coffee, and a glass of orange juice.  All right, Peter.  Thank you.  Hey, I love you guys, man.  I was wondering if someone was going to pick up on that.  I know.  How far I was going to go.  Dude, I worked there.  I changed her bedpan.  Oh, wow.  Look at that. 
[00:37:30]  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, Pete.  Yes, sir.  You're on the radio.  Hey.  Hey.  I got a story.  A couple years back down the block from my house, old man, nasty old man had this big wheelchair set up  with oxygen tanks built into it.  And he cursed at us, you know, in the street, playing in the street.  He'd roll around.  He burnt his house down.  And that fire ended up being so big that it melted the siding off my neighbor's house.  And they were afraid the whole block was going to go up.  Whoa.  That's great.  Imagine that.  You have oxygen strapped to you.  That was nasty. 
[00:38:00]  Those things go up.  All of a sudden, you're just, you just become like a piece of charcoal instantly.  Now, the cops had the whole neighborhood blocked off.  Nothing better than the old man in the wheelchair with the oxygen yelling at you.  The vinyl siding in the house next door just poof, like caught fire spontaneously.  Man.  After getting melted for hours.  But that's the story.  All right, Pete.  I'm going to listen to myself on the radio.  Thank you.  Probably wanted to die.  Anthony, this is going to want to die.  The story gets better.  Yeah.  This is going to be an exclusive for the O&A show.  The cigarette is checking in.  Mr. Marlboro, what's up? 
[00:38:30]  Yo.  Hey.  Yo, you believe this goddamn bitch right to sneak me in the dame house, little man?  I was nice and cozy in her back.  Yeah.  Not to mention she was such a junkie, she had to buy a soft pack.  Where were you heading?  Me?  Yeah, were you heading in her snatch panties?  I was in the stankest of all places.  I was still next to some eggs.  I think, I don't know, I shot them up or downers.  All right, Mr. Cigarette.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  Vito. 
[00:39:00]  Gentlemen, don't you know?  Don't you know?  Don't you know, Vito.  How are you?  Very well.  Listen, this maneuver with the oxygen tank, this is commonly done all the time, you know.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, when we blow up the cars, we put the oxygen tank under the driver's seat and we  let it rip.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well done, Vito.  Thank you so much.  That's very enlightening.  Oxygen under the seat.  So the guy really gets crisp.  And then they blow up the signal, forget it, it's over. 
[00:39:30]  Is that what happened to Abolonia?  Oh, we can't talk about that.  All right, Vito.  All right.  She went up real good.  All right, ciao.  Ciao.  Here goes Vito.  Once again, Vito checking in.  Unfortunately, Vito doesn't know much about the Godfather.  The bit would really be good if Vito actually knew anything about the Godfather, aside from  just the voice.  Does the voice great, too.  He's got to bone up on some Godfather trivia.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?  This is Carlos Mencia and you're listening to Opie and Anthony, talking some s*** about  every motherf***er you can.  And we're going to do some n***a jokes, some spick jokes, some kink jokes, some fag jokes.  And if you're a midget, we're going to talk about your ass, too.  On 1027-WAW. 
[00:40:30]  212-757-1027.  We move on with Ian.  Ian, what's going on today?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  When I was about 10 or 11, man, the guy next door blew up his house with, like,  18 cans of gasoline because he was suicidally at cancer.  And, uh, like, the house just, like, incinerated.  And there was, like, a toilet and, like, the guy next door's yard and nothing.  Whoa, hey.  What are you doing with the effing word?  Sorry, man.  It's the weed.  Can't use that. 
[00:41:00]  What are you...  So he put gas in the house?  Like, left the gas on and blew himself up?  Like, all over his house, all over himself.  It was crazy.  That's pretty selfish.  And, like, the police report after said the only part they found of him was a toe.  If you're going to kill yourself, please do it with pills.  I mean, and then put yourself somewhere where you're not going to be found by your kids or something.  People are so selfish when they kill themselves.  And people throw themselves in front of trains.  The poor engineer is some schlep trying to eke out a living. 
[00:41:30]  And now he's got to live with your stupid face going,  Ah!  As the thing he remembers saying as he slams into you.  I have a story, Anthony.  What?  Maybe one of my brothers wants to call in.  We went on a little family vacation when we were really young.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Not an Opie youth story.  I need Brett or maybe Darren to call.  Oh, these are horrific. 
[00:42:00]  Mom and Dad, we're like 10, 11.  We're pretty much the same age in my family, more or less.  We're all, like, less than a year apart.  A little more than a year apart.  And Mom and Dad, they're like,  Hey, we're going on vacation to upstate New York.  They didn't give us many details because they didn't want to scare us too much before we got there.  Scare you before you got there?  Turns out my older sister, technically my half-sister, was inheriting some money from her uncle on her side of the family. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Well, he died.  How did it happen?  And she inherited the money, his house, and the motels.  The motel rooms.  The motel rooms.  Did you ever get, like, way upstate New York and they have those places where you could, you know, stop in for a...  Bates Motel.  Pretty much Bates Motel where they're all the separate...  These were separate...  Little... 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, I've seen these.  Separate little shacks.  Bungalows, right.  Bungalows, right.  Okay.  So, we're all excited.  We're going on vacation.  We're going to be hanging at, you know, this guy's motel and it has a pool and, you know, all sorts of fun things to do.  That's how it was explained to us.  Oh, no.  So, we're taking the car ride up to this place.  I forget where.  Way upstate New York.  And as we're doing our little road trip, the story comes out that the guy died very recently.  He was smoking in bed. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, and he burnt up.  He burnt up and, yeah, lit half his house on fire.  Smoldered in his bed.  And he was also suffering from gangrene.  Gangrene.  One of his footsies there was pretty much rotting off his spine.  So, we get to this guy's house because my sister's got to check out what she just inherited.  Look, I'm shaking just thinking about it.  Oh, no.  So, there's the house.  And we go inside. 
[00:44:00]  Now, we're kind of prepared, but we're little kids that the guy died recently.  And there's burn marks all over this goddamn house and paneling up where the walls were completely burned away.  Where he burnt.  And we went into the room where he burnt.  And there, where the bed used to be, is just a blank space.  Were there oily rags around?  No, no oily rags.  Did you leave any oily rags, like when you burnt your woods down?  No?  No oily rags.  You weren't responsible for this?  No, I wasn't responsible for this.  Just wondering.  And then my dad gets the, you know, the bright idea after we check out the house. 
[00:44:30]  And now we're all just freaked out of our minds.  Because we're like, a guy died within, like, a couple weeks.  Here's the remnants of the guy's life in front of us.  And my dad's like, well, look, he's got all these, you know, motel, you know, little shacks.  Why don't we stay the night?  It was a scene right out of a goddamn horror movie.  What a nightmare.  So now all you're thinking is the burnt dead guy is going to be walking around.  In the middle of nowhere, in the middle of, like, the Catskills. 
[00:45:00]  Let me in.  Let me in.  The grounds of the place, just overgrown.  I mean, you know, they didn't have a lawnmower or anything going on.  The pool wasn't cleaned out in years.  Kind of like the pool from, you know, that Chevy Chase movie there.  Vacation.  You know when people burn?  The smoke that's on the walls contains some of their remains.  You were there.  Let me in. 
[00:45:30]  I'm so hot.  I'm burning up.  I did it right the first time.  And then my dad, you know, gives us all, like, a motel shack to stay in.  Make a long story short, the linen wasn't changed for many years.  Just mildew, musky smell.  Spider webs as big as you can imagine in the corner of the room.  Musky or musty?  I hope it wasn't musky.  Musky.  Musty.  Right.  Smelt like man's sack.  I don't know what that smells like, but you know what? 
[00:46:00]  I would bet money that it's pretty close, okay?  And I'm making a long story short.  My mom finally got involved and got us the hell out of there, and we went to town for a real hotel.  And that was supposed to be our big family vacation.  The family vacation.  To a dead guy's house.  Oh.  Nice.  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  Hey, when people do that, I was talking about what we were talking about earlier, 
[00:46:30]  where people are killing themselves, and they're just so selfish in the way they do it.  What about the big guys that jump off the buildings?  You don't know if you're going to hit somebody.  Just going about your goddamn business, and some big fat guy lands on you and kills you.  What about the one a couple years ago at the Harley-Davidson Cafe where Rick went down to the scene  and saw body parts on the sidewalks?  Horrified many onlookers that probably still have nightmares of this guy.  Nightmares?  The one lady got hit by the guy, remember? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, she got hit in the shoulder.  In the shoulder.  In the shoulder.  He just missed crushing her skull.  He smashed the ground, and she was covered with, like, person pulp.  And brain matter.  Yeah, it's my brain.  No, I believe she was covered by spam chunks.  Spam chunks.  Rock.  But if you're going to do it, you know, pick a little location, take your pills, and go away.  It was kind of cool to see, though.  See, that doesn't do it.  See, I can't do that either.  Eric, what's up? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, hey.  Hey, buddy.  I think you just made that up, or you saw that on Scooby-Doo, that story.  My story?  No, I know.  It does sound like a Scooby-Doo story, right?  Because it was deserted like that, and you're right.  Oh, no, Scooby-Doo.  I will never forget, though, like, especially his bedroom.  The walls just had, you know, paneling up, and then, you know, what kind of boards there, Anthony?  Paneling.  Not paneling.  You know, when you're boarding up a goddamn window. 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  Boards?  Oh, whatever.  And you realize the guy died in that room.  Dang it.  Thanks, Eric.  You called the super friends to help you out?  No, I think it was the Globetrotters who were living.  All right, Eric.  Hey, good evening.  Thank you.  Let's go to Richard.  Richard, what's going on, buddy?  Hi, how's it going?  Listen, I saw, I heard a story in the news yesterday.  You're talking about people blowing up.  Uh, somewhere in China, there was an explosion in an elementary school. 
[00:48:30]  Apparently, the children, I don't know if they were being taught or being used like slave labor,  they were making fireworks in the school.  And the elementary school blew up.  And that was in the paper yesterday?  Richard?  Richard.  Richard.  Ah, he's all pissed.  It was right there.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, Tim.  Hey, yeah, I got to tell you this story. 
[00:49:00]  I was, my wife and I were buying a house in this beautiful suburb outside the city in New Jersey.  The realtor calls us up and says, hey, can you guys be over at the house in like 15 minutes?  We want to, we want to show it to you.  It's going to go on the market tomorrow, but boy, you guys got to see it right away.  So he queues us in.  He can't find the light.  It's like dust, it's getting dark.  And he slips on like something that looks like grease or like, like dark brown grease on the floor.  And it turns out that this old lady, been living in this house, she fell down the flight of stairs, 
[00:49:30]  smacked her head on the end table at the bottom of the stairs, bled out on the floor.  They had taken her away like six hours earlier.  So just fresh dead.  Fresh, I mean, this, this was like, it was like, it was like a clean kill.  It was like a snapshot of her from like eight hours before in her last moment of life.  Like her bed was unmade and there was crap all over the place.  Like there's like a glass half full and her dentures.  Oh, that's how this guy's house was.  You could tell he was recently living there. 
[00:50:00]  Thank goodness my son, Michael, got me the life phone pendant.  Yeah.  It was, it was brutal.  I told the realtor, we're like, we're never working with you again.  There's no way the realtor was showing the house that soon after someone died.  No, I swear to God, I swear to God.  Oh, realtors would probably do that.  You don't want the bad publicity to get out.  So you like right away show the house.  I think the guy was a guy was an idiot because he didn't look at that first.  He didn't know that it was there.  So he took us in thinking, oh, okay, look, the lady's gone.  I'll get us, get these people in here before the rest of the world and it gets listed. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  You would think at the least they would at least clean up the place.  Yeah.  Run a mop over the floor.  Right.  Why not?  He was an idiot.  He didn't go and look at it first.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys talk.  Thanks, Tim.  Pretty twisted story, huh?  Bob, what's going on?  Yeah, dude.  What's going on?  Hey, Bob.  Hey, man.  It's a bunch of years ago.  I used to work for a mason, and the guy was a former merchant marine, so he kind of developed  a little drug problem.  And he went in and out of rehab, and he finally just couldn't take it anymore, and he had tried 
[00:51:00]  a couple of times.  And what he did, he lived in an old home.  He sat on a staircase, tied an electrical cord around his neck and put it up on the beam,  OD'd.  And in the process of OD'ing, if it didn't kill him for doing that, he fell face down  and got choked to death.  And I almost came close to finding the body, because he did it on a Sunday, went to the  house to work on Monday, no answer.  And I'm like, truck's here.  I'm like, what's the deal? 
[00:51:30]  Next morning, his girlfriend and his other dude found him.  I almost broke into the house, too, to see what the hell was up.  Yeah, you don't want to be that guy.  Yeah, well, guess what?  Boy, did it stink.  We haven't gotten an answer to repeated phone calls.  Could you head over to Bob's house?  No, I'm Bob, man.  I was just using a generic name, Dick.  Sorry, Dick.  Yo, and actually, the sick thing, he's a descendant of the woman who wrote Frankenstein.  Oh, look at that.  Oof-ba.  Very nice.  Thank you, my brothers. 
[00:52:00]  All right, buddy.  That brought the whole story together, Opie.  I know.  Larry!  Yeah, how you doing?  Good, buddy.  I got this jumper story.  It happened about 10 years ago out in Rockaway Beach.  Uh-huh.  But sitting on our terrace, directly across the must of another building, 12 stories high.  I look up.  I see a guy standing on the roof.  And I said, oh, my God, this guy's going to jump.  I got my grandmother here from Florida, like 75 years old.  And right after I said this guy's going to jump, he jumps. 
[00:52:30]  He lands.  My grandmother starts freaking out.  I run downstairs, me and my girlfriend, and the guy's still, like, fidgeting.  Yeah, yeah, big whoop.  No one can.  And my girlfriend's like, aren't you going to help him?  The cop goes, why should I help him?  I've been to enough of these things.  This guy's dead.  And he's, like, fidgeting.  Hello?  He lands.  My grandmother starts freaking out. 
[00:53:00]  I run downstairs, me and my girlfriend, and the guy's still, like, fidgeting.  Yeah, yeah, big whoop.  No one can.  And the girlfriend's like, aren't you going to help him?  The cop goes, why should I help him?  I've been to enough of these things.  This guy's dead.  He's, like, fidgeting.  Hello?  You heard it three times.  It's like putting a mirror to a mirror, you know?  You just look down that long hallway of mirrors. 
[00:53:30]  I heard it three times.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what's going on, buddy?  What's up, O-N-E?  Hey, I hope you're a little better than the last guy.  Listen, I'm in Randolph, New Jersey, and my wife and I are looking for a house.  This is another realtor story.  Realtor comes, okay, says, meet us at this house.  It's all overgrown, okay, has a nice big sign out in front.  We go there.  Now, I'm the kind of guy that likes to check out the boiler in the basement and all,  and my wife likes to check out the rooms. 
[00:54:00]  So I've heard stories that a guy killed himself there, and I was like, yeah, it's just hearsay.  No big deal.  I go down to the basement where my wife keeps the realtor busy.  When they took the guy down, they just saw the rope off.  The rest of the rope was hanging from the beam.  Oh, man.  You want to talk eerie?  I just, like, nudge my wife.  I'm like, we're out of here now.  Now, let's go.  Oh, my God.  I guess the realtors just don't care.  It's like that gag we always do.  Hose it down.  That's it.  And start the ride out. 
[00:54:30]  And keep it moving.  Keep the ride going.  All right, Jim.  All right, fellas.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Rippy's a realtor.  Rippy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, you're really a realtor?  Yes, I am.  I just actually got away.  Just left the property right now.  Okay.  Yeah.  As far as for realtors coming, we see so much property each day.  And we see a thing called a multiple list that you get into the property with a key.  And I've gotten into the property before.  I've seen bloodstains on the wall. 
[00:55:00]  But we don't know about it.  The landlords don't tell you about it all the time.  Why aren't they cleaning their property before you get in there?  Well, the thing is, sometimes the tenants are still there.  And, you know, the owners, they just say, give a courtesy call.  Call the, you know, tenants and say, all right, I'm coming in.  I'm going to take a look at the place.  And you go over there and the tenants forget about it.  And there's stuff all over the place, food on the ground, you know, the kids running around the backyard, puking all over the place.  Yeah.  I've seen some horrible instances. 
[00:55:30]  We actually had a property that a landlord called up and said that one of the tenants that was put into the place about a month ago just died.  So now they've got to rent the place out again.  He said, but you've got to give us a few days because he's actually going to clean the place up.  Because the guy, I don't know what happened, but he said there was blood all over the place.  So they've got to clean it up.  They've got to clean the carpets.  So, you know, as far as for the realtor side, we don't know all the time what's going on.  That's, uh, yeah, well, I don't think you guys would care. 
[00:56:00]  Hose it down.  Believe me.  Bring in the new people.  It's not easy to sell a place when you're saying, oh, kindly overlook the blood chain over there.  Yeah, right?  You know?  All right, Rippy.  Thank you, Rippy.  All right, guys.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Rippy the realtor.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Wife and I were about to buy a house.  We went looking at it.  Check it out.  It was a gorgeous, gorgeous house.  Money was right. 
[00:56:30]  Went in there, saw the people paying it.  We were like, wow, you're paying it before you guys leave?  And they were like, yeah, yeah, you know.  So we put a bid in on it.  They accepted the bid.  Went into attorney review.  My wife's getting her nails done.  They said, oh, you bought that house on that street?  We were like, yeah, why?  My wife said, the lady that had the place shot herself in the face in the bedroom.  Blood all over everywhere.  They weren't going to let us have our deposit back.  I was like, hell no, man.  I ain't living there.  Who's to say that she's, you know, not gone, floating around somewhere, hanging out? 
[00:57:00]  That's a little too creepy.  We had a family kill themselves.  A father killed his family in the house we lived in and just moved out of.  They moved in.  And all the pictures in the newspaper, it's like we have pictures of us playing in the  house, you know?  We moved out.  Three months later, this family moves in.  It's a father and two kids.  Was this on the island?  Yeah, Long Island, right there behind Fred's Diner in Huntington, East Northport, I guess.  It was Barry Place.  You know where Fred's Diner is up there in Derrick Park? 
[00:57:30]  Right behind there.  And we move out.  Three months later, this guy moves in with his son and daughter.  And one day, the father comes to the house.  Doesn't have his key.  Knocks on the door.  The daughter opens the door.  He just shoots her in the head, walks into the living room, shoots the son, and then  shoots himself right there.  And all the pictures that they had of the house were the pictures we had of them because  it was our house that we grew up in.  You know, I'm thinking, like, there's the son getting shot in the living room.  That's the living room I sat in and watched, you know, all my TV that I watched for years. 
[00:58:00]  And opened Christmas presents.  Yeah.  Yeah, all that stuff.  Lesson, don't forget your key.  Thank you.  Don't open the door.  Or your parent forgets the key.  Vicki, what's going on?  Not much.  Just wanted to let you know, I was in Japan.  And there, like, suicide is pretty much okay.  It's your way of, like, saving your family, the shame and embarrassment.  And there is this guy killed himself by hanging himself.  Wife came home.  She was ashamed. 
[00:58:30]  She hung herself.  And the two kids came home, set themselves on fire.  And the grandfather caused them a time before they killed themselves.  So, all that's left for the kids after being burned.  So, it's kind of an odd situation.  That's bizarre.  Thank you.  Thank you, Vicki.  All right.  Now that everyone's in a good mood.  Yeah.  And it sounds like you're talking about the Amityville Horror House.  No.  This was a house I used to live in.  Steve, what's going on? 
[00:59:00]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I was just wondering if there's any chance that maybe Erin could get her own radio show?  To tell her stories and stuff?  Yeah.  You know, she could just sit around telling stories all day long.  I mean, she was pushing buttons I didn't know I had.  Yeah.  There was some twisted stuff coming out of her mouth last night.  Yesterday, after we got off the air, we were saying they were sickly hot stories.  Like, they were hot, but so sick that you didn't want to think they were hot.  Oh, man.  Maybe she could take one of your hours. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, you guys are good and everything, but...  She could be the warm-up hour for our show.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  I'm going to go listen to my radio and hear Anthony call me a tool.  Take it easy.  Later.  Steve, you tool.  Tool.  Tool.  Listen to this.  Tool.  Another Steve checking in.  Steve, what's going on?  What's going on, man?  Yeah, we used to go over to my friend's house.  We used to do drugs over there.  All kinds of stuff.  The landlady, she let my friends stay over there. 
[01:00:00]  This old, decrepit lady.  She looked like a skeleton.  And like a living skeleton, man.  But one day I came over there in the morning.  I used to smoke cigarettes, but I put off smoking a cigarette.  I walked in her house, and I looked over in the kitchen, and she was face down, like, dead.  Dead.  Dead.  She sounds dead, man.  I turned the gas off.  I would have blew the house up if I lit the cigarette, man.  Did you take it for a ride?  Check this out, though, man.  Yeah.  A friend, like, two months later. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Same guy.  We were building some pipe bombs.  Uh-huh.  He blew his hand off.  Oh, man.  All right.  Check this out, though.  On the front lawn.  I went there the next day.  There was, his finger was still on the ground, covered with ants.  I almost freaked out.  I went over.  I got my girlfriend at the time.  I brought her back to show her the fingers.  Yeah.  But the damn dog ate it.  Oh.  Virgin.  Thank you, Steve.  Yo, you guys are tools.  Listen.  Anthony, when are you playing in your band again? 
[01:01:00]  I don't know.  That was, I tell you, man, that was an ass-kicking time I had over in Northport.  Yeah, that was fun.  We'll throw something together again.  We don't do it that often.  I got some pictures, man.  Anthony's staring at the boobs.  There we go.  Steve, I can tell you, we may be doing a road show very, very soon.  Yes.  We will give you details.  Maybe we can get ants banned to do a few tunes.  Hey, if you guys wouldn't mind, I'd like to videotape and take pictures of everything.  All right, Steve.  Well, we'll have details soon.  Cool, man.  See you guys later.  We got it figured out, but we may be doing a huge road show in the next, like, ten days. 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  Stay tuned.  Stay close.  Two weeks from today, it would be.  So, two weeks.  Okay.  Yeah.  There was one more, and then we've got to move on.  Yes, I'm getting all depressed.  Another Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Listen, I tell you, this happened about 10, 12 years ago when I was out of work.  I started doing some commercial diving with my cousin.  So, we had to go over and survey these piers over in Elizabeth's where they unload the container 
[01:02:00]  ships.  Yeah.  And what you have to do is you have to go under the piers and sort of measure to see  if they're sinking into the mud.  So, he's under there, and I'm looking at his flashlight, and I'm in a little tender boat  watching, and all of a sudden, he starts screaming.  So, he comes down.  He's like, there's a floater back there.  And I'm like, what the hell's a floater?  So, he's like, it's a dead body.  He's like, you're kidding me.  So, we wait for the cops to come.  They fish out the dead body, and this is where it really gets nasty.  They bring the guy up onto the platform, and we've got to kind of stay there to tell  him what's happening, what we saw, and how we found it and all.  I'm looking at the guy, and I'm thinking he's wearing a green shirt, and he's actually, 
[01:02:30]  his skin is green like Herman Munster.  And his eyes are missing.  Something ate his eyes out.  Oh, the eyes are the first things to go.  His stomach is bloated like a beach ball.  Yeah, you should have kicked it when it cracks open, and a nice smell comes out.  You know, I had heard they stink, but it wasn't stinking yet, I guess because he was in the  water.  So, all of a sudden, the cops are all milling around there and having a coffee, and we're  talking, and the next thing you know, there's a seagull standing by the body.  Oh, no.  It just flies up, and it pecks the guy in his stomach, and this black crap starts pouring 
[01:03:00]  out all over.  Oh.  It was instant death stink.  Oh, that is great.  Hey, hope you never smell it.  Steve, dead bloated bodies, good eating for the seagulls.  Good eating.  Oh, I'm telling you, man, I never want to get in the water and go diving again like that.  And you had to stay with the body for a while.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, we were there for like a good hour and a half.  It was fairly foul, I've got to tell you.  And all the cops were telling dead body stories while we were there. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, I'm sure they got all a bunch of great ones, yeah.  Hey, take care, fellas.  You guys are good.  All right, thank you.  Yeah.  This is a firefighter.  We've got to move on with this.  This guy has something.  Mike, the firefighter, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, O.A.?  Hey.  Listen, number one place, right in your area there, right in Times Square.  What's the most famous hotel in Times Square?  Well, let's not make this a quiz.  Mary Marquis.  I must have been to over a dozen of them suicides over there. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, really?  People like killing themselves there?  People just go there.  They're not even there more than probably six hours.  They check in, and then they jump off the atrium there.  That's probably the bill.  I've been tempted to jump out a few windows, and I get the minibar bill.  You ever go there, they have that big atrium there, and then they've got all the bars and  all the railings.  And when they fall down, they hit all the bars, and they bust up, and they land on like 18 different  floors.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  This is a twisted segment. 
[01:04:30]  There's a million of them.  I saw a guy jump in front of him.  Wow.  Let me go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I'm on Roosevelt Avenue in the dead of the summer.  Guy jumps in front of the, you know, it's the train that's on the L.  Guy jumps in front of the train, gets all tangled up in the train and everything, and then  starts dripping onto the street.  Guts, body parts.  I mean, it stinks like you couldn't believe.  Man, I got there before the, well, actually, as like the fire department was getting there, 
[01:05:00]  so this was fresh, you know?  Yeah.  It was fresh.  It was fresh.  Fresh.  Get it fresh.  Exactly.  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Keep there on MS3.  All right.  We'll finish this with Keith the cop.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, fellas, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Got a good dead body story for you from when I was a rookie.  Keith, we go to this apartment building, and the worst call you can get as a rookie is  strange odor.  Keith, wait a minute, Keith. 
[01:05:30]  It's Psycho Mark.  I don't want to interrupt this story, but I'm going to arrest him.  They won't take my PBA card.  I got to call you up.  Can you help me, Keith, please?  Mark will never get helped again.  That's Keith's phone every 10 minutes.  That's right.  Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get.  It was on the 15th floor, and we're in the elevator going up, and at the 11th floor,  you could smell the body already.  The guy was being a real prank, Keith.  This cop, I gave him my PBA card.  I told him who I am.  I'm Psycho Mark. 
[01:06:00]  You don't arrest me.  Something about a kilo of cart and coke on me, and I'm drunk, and I was assaulting someone.  I'm a goddamn celebrity.  I'm a celebrity, absolutely.  Thank you, Keith.  Come down, get me out of jail.  I got some AK-47, get, get, get.  Keith, poor Keith, every day.  I actually haven't had a call in like two weeks, so he's on a roll.  Hey, there you go.  He's staying out of trouble.  So with the story, we get like the 11th floor in the elevator, and it's on the 15th floor. 
[01:06:30]  You can smell the day.  Oh, it's seeping down.  As soon as the doors open, you just want to hurl.  And there's people living on the same floor with this guy.  He's dead for about a week.  They just think it's the Indian couple cooking dinner.  Going to the apartment.  What the hell do they cook, man?  Dead body.  We go in there, the guy's laying on the bed, and he's all bloated and everything. 
[01:07:00]  His face is bloated and stuff.  And the worst part is, as a rookie, the guy says to me, the sergeant, he goes, all right,  you got to go in there and get the watch off that guy's wrist.  And I'm like, I ain't going in there and touching that guy.  As soon as the ME came in, he went in there, the guy popped.  Popped?  Popped?  No.  Like you would not believe.  Like from all the gases and everything?  People explode, Opie.  You just want to hurl all over.  Wait, wait.  That's a term you guys use? 
[01:07:30]  The guy popped?  Yeah.  And we got a popper.  And then you got to sit there and wait until the moor comes and gets him.  It's a horrible thing.  With their shovels.  Oh.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  Got to sit there.  Cute little story, Keith.  Thanks.  Hey, I'll talk to you guys soon, man.  Have a good one.  Help me out here.  We need to get something hot going on, because this is getting ugly today.  Keen, dead, bloated bodies.  Nope.  Nope.  Doesn't work.  There are some things it doesn't work for.  John, what's up? 
[01:08:00]  Hey, what's up, Bowen X?  Hey.  Hey, listen, we were down in Carolina looking for a house about five years ago.  This real estate agent, she's like, all right, I got a good deal.  If people are getting divorced, we can work this out.  She didn't realize a week ago there was a mass murder in a house.  We got there.  There's still crime scene tape all around the freaking house.  That's what you want, crime scene tape.  Guy just got pissed off and whacked there, and the woman didn't even know.  We walked up to the house and was like, what the hell is yellow tape?  He got closer.  It just said crime scene.  The house was all boarded up and cracked.  Yeah, but no one, the realtor. 
[01:08:30]  They just stepped over the tape and wanted to tell you the house.  Look at the closet space.  This is great.  This is the kitchen.  Pretty roomy.  Lots of cabinets.  Notice the speckled red paint.  Custom design.  And notice the view.  Just step over the popper over here.  The guy that tops.  Thank you, John.  Have a good one, guys.  I'm getting grossed out.  Yeah, I think we can move on, huh?  Please.  All right.  The Hopi of Anthony Show.  Gus from Long Island writes, Anthony, I used to be a carpet layer. 
[01:09:00]  I went to an apartment.  Carpet layer.  I went to an apartment where some guy blew his brains out.  Yeah.  The owner of the apartment wanted me to clean up the mess.  I saw the police white line where the body laid with brain and blood on carpet.  Oh.  The guy was too cheap to replace the whole rug.  So he had me cut out stains and replaced with teeth from closets.  Hey, there you go.  That's a common practice there in the carpet industry, Hopi.  I almost chucked a dozen times while doing the job. 
[01:09:30]  I did that once in an apartment.  I took the broiler pan out of the oven, and the kitchen was actually carpeted.  It had some kind of indoor-outdoor kind of carpeting thing.  Really horrendous, I know.  And I put the broiler pan on the carpet, and it was a nylon carpet.  I tried to pick the broiler pan up.  It wouldn't come up.  It was glued now to the melted of the carpet.  I had to take the razor knife, cut the big square out in this big square hole in the kitchen carpeting. 
[01:10:00]  And then I went into the closet.  You find the carpet in the closet.  You cut out a big square and glue it down.  Does it look good?  No, it looked like crap.  But it wasn't a big hole or a broiler pan sitting in my kitchen.  Why don't you pick that up?  I can't.  You try.  Glued there.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  There's tapes out there called Banned from TV.  There's three volumes that I know of.  Have you ever seen them?  No.  Oh, man, they're sick.  They're pretty much what you're talking about.  Like, you know how Faces of Death is all fake stuff?  Yeah.  These are legit.  These are taken, like, from, like, Peruvian TV. 
[01:10:30]  It opens up with some guy running out of, like, some hostage thing or whatever.  And the cop blasts him in the chest with a shotgun.  Like, point blank on TV.  You know, it's legit.  And the first tape ends with a woman getting nailed by a speeding train.  Oh, we've all seen that one.  Like, where her body just explodes and her arms spiral off all over the place.  And she flies into the camera guy and actually killed him, too.  There's, like, three hours of tape like that.  If you want, I'll send it to you.  It's beyond sick.  No, I'm so not into that stuff. 
[01:11:00]  Well, I hope he wants to say it.  No, I've got to bring up something that's going to make Anthony sick.  What?  Remember Buzzy?  Yeah.  My good friend Buzzy, fraternity brother.  He had a collection of tapes called Sick Ass.  Sick Ass Volumes 1 through, like, I think he was up to 9.  Unedited news footage.  Yeah, because it works for a news station, so they get all the unedited stuff.  And obviously, you know, they go to all the suicide things and this and that.  And he would put these tapes together. 
[01:11:30]  And he would trade with his little TV friends all over the country.  I don't like the dead stuff.  Sex rules.  He had the Bud Dwyer, Anthony.  Yeah.  Bud Dwyer, stand back.  Oh, I don't want anyone getting hurt.  But that was live on TV.  That one.  Oh, no.  But the rap video was never on TV.  I got to get the Bud Dwyer rap video.  He took the Bud Dwyer tape and edited it with a rap song playing in the background.  But he did the fast or the forward backward motion on the video. 
[01:12:00]  So right when he shoots himself in the head and his hair flies up, now he goes backwards.  So his hair is going up, down, up, down, up, up, down, up, down to the music.  And it's like, wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki.  No, sex with the dead isn't sex.  It's dead.  I'm not into, I said I'm into sex.  The sex tapes rule.  But the dead tapes and pages.  What about the sex with the dead body?  Yeah, that was great, too. 
[01:12:30]  This was the first impression my buddy Buzzy made on Anthony.  You've called this before.  Hey, Ant.  I got a tape for you to check out.  Check this out.  Quickly, it's two girls fondling a guy on a couch, and they're playing with his junk.  And the camera's tightly zoomed in on his crotch area, and you see her hand manipulating.  And then all of a sudden, she starts getting a little rough.  And then before you know it, she's taking the...  What?  You're missing a very important part of the story.  What?  She was taking his...  I was just going to say that. 
[01:13:00]  Okay, okay.  She starts getting a little rough.  She takes the yam bag and starts twisting it like it's a doorknob.  Like a doorknob.  Like a hairy doorknob.  She's twisting it once, twice, three times around.  So it looks like it's just going to go...  Well, and it got to the point where you're like, all right, if the guy's into that, you can understand maybe...  Not even half a twist.  Right, maybe a little bit of a twist, but she went once around, twice around, three times around.  I think she went even further, because the you-know-whats looked like they were ready to do it. 
[01:13:30]  Ready to pop.  It was purple.  And then she started...  This was the real clincher.  Then she was picking him up by the twisted yam bag.  By the junk.  Picking him up by it.  Picking him up, Pete.  So at this point, you're like, what the hell is this guy into?  Just when you start trying to figure it out.  All you see is the shot of his junk, and the girl doing all this.  Just when you might start figuring out what's going on, they pan back.  Slowly.  Slowly pull the camera back, so you see the whole guy and the girl, and the guy is dead as a doornail. 
[01:14:00]  Dead as a doornail.  Fresh dead, too, because he was still pliable.  I think it was done in a funeral home, it looked like.  It looked like some kind of funeral parlor, like they just grabbed this guy, took his clothes off, and made this sick porno with it.  As real as it gets, too.  It was as real as it gets.  I was totally disturbed by that, and I could not watch it again.  I gave that tape to someone else, because I couldn't even take it.  I could not take it.  Yeah, that tape was filled with a ton of stuff. 
[01:14:30]  His yam bag looked like a Stretch Armstrong.  The way she was pulling it.  Yeesh.  Wow, where did you find the Bud Dwyer thing?  What is that, the Bud Dwyer link on Instant Feedback?  Bud Dwyer.  You could get Bud Dwyer shirts.  Yeah, it's the Bud Dwyer fan club.  Get Bud Dwyer fan club.  Get a swanky t-shirt.  Look at poor Bud.  Oh, he's got his hand up.  Get a t-shirt.  Oh, here he is with the gun in his mouth. 
[01:15:00]  I want shirt two.  Let me look at shirt two.  No, shirt one has the gun in his mouth.  Shirt two, I think, has...  Let's see.  Here is shirt two.  Oh, yeah.  That's the...  Okay.  All right.  Even seeing the still of that.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Shirt two has the gun in his mouth and right after he pulled the trigger.  Whoa.  And you could get a t-shirt of that.  Look at his eye and his hair.  Okay.  Blow out.  Okay.  And the blood on the back wall. 
[01:15:30]  Damn it!  Look at the face you make when you shoot yourself in the mouth.  Stop.  You look silly.  It looks like...  Ooh.  Don't shoot yourself in the mouth with a .357 Magnum.  You look silly.  That's not a good look for him.  No.  See, this is fine.  He almost has a Dick Cheney look to him.  And this, he looks like a grandpa from the Munsters.  Mm.  Yeah.  I'm going to get the rap video now.  What do you got, pictures? 
[01:16:00]  Still pics?  No, member pics.  Oh, what, do they all got the guns in their mouths?  They have guns up to their head, up to their mouth.  This sight is friggin' sick.  Come on.  It's foul.  Our Bud Dwyer fan club members holding guns to their head.  Look at this guy.  He's double-fisted.  One to his temple and one in his mouth.  Oh, my God.  Just when I thought I'd seen it all on the web.  It's BudDwyer.com, by the way.  There you go. 
[01:16:30]  Have some fun with it.  Wow, that chick looks hot.  I hope she blows her head off.  All right, well.  Disturbing.  Emily, what's going on?  Emily.  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Before we all start vomiting, I thought maybe we could get back to the face slapping.  You like the face slapping from yesterday?  Yeah, you know, I think a lot more women are into it than they'd like to admit.  You're into the face slapping?  Yeah.  Come on. 
[01:17:00]  I mean, not all the time.  It first happened, I was with an old boyfriend, we're in the act, and wham, just a slap across  the face, and...  Wait, did you ask for the slap, or he just did it?  No, no, he did it.  He just took that chance, assuming that you'd be into the same thing he was into.  Right.  So, you know, it's a shock.  You're like, what the hell was that?  And it's a turn-on.  I don't know.  I can't explain it.  But I think a lot of women are into it.  But, Emlyn?  Yes.  Okay, all right. 
[01:17:30]  So it's a turn-on.  But is it like a cute little slap, or the harder the better?  Well, it was a cute little slap the first time.  And then when I guess you saw my reaction, I was okay with it.  You know, then the next one was a whack.  And is it embarrassing after you're done?  I mean, now you have the sex after the slap, you know, the slapping of the face.  Doesn't it get a little awkward when you're, you know, now watching TV together? 
[01:18:00]  No, no.  I think that's part of the turn-on, too, is, you know, you get that little pang of humiliation.  And it's all, you know, it's, I don't know, people acquaint it with BDSM.  Well, you know, people that have the spanking fetish, I mean, I guess face-lapping can be part of humiliation.  All right, well, I'm going to play the slap for you again from yesterday.  Thank you.  This is Erin getting slapped really hard by Jim Norton.  Great.  Make a full fist, wind up and punch her teeth out.  I'm leaving here with his rosy cheeks and with Norton. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Jim, come.  Norton, kick her in the face.  Look at the look, Jim, Jim.  This is so wrong.  Jim, this is so effing wrong.  Jim, wait, wait, wait.  Calm down.  Rick, look out.  I got to see this.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Harder, harder.  Back it up a little bit.  I want to get short.  Oh, God.  One more.  One more.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:19:00]  All right, all right.  Woo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Can we stab you?  You hear that, Emily?  That's right.  Yeah.  Now, see, what happened yesterday, that's not erotic.  Why?  To me, at least.  Why?  Because it has to happen within the sexual act.  Oh, so like where you're naked and pounding and then you just start smacking.  Exactly.  All right, we got a psych guy on the line here.  Oh, I'm a psych woman.  I don't need to talk to him. 
[01:19:30]  I just want to hear what he has to say.  All right.  He could be full of ass.  Frank?  Yeah.  What's up?  What do you got?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I want to get my full name, but I've taken a lot of psychology classes and this face slapping  thing, you know, if it's done in play, it's one thing, but these girls are calling up and  saying they really enjoy it.  It directly stems back to a childhood sexual abuse thing that maybe they don't even remember.  Frank, are you a therapist?  Yes, I am.  So you've taken psych classes.  Yeah.  You're also a therapist?  I don't want to go too far because I don't want to put my job on the line here, but I just 
[01:20:00]  thought I'd give my opinion that if you read any text relating to this kind of abusive  behavior, I mean, you know, a slap on the ass is one thing when you're in bed and having  fun, but I mean, women that really intentionally like to be slapped hard in the face, there's  some definite underlying psychological things going on there.  Emily, to you?  Yeah.  Emily?  Why what?  Comment.  Comment.  Comment.  Oh, you know, there's only so much you can read from a book.  Well, no, I understand that, but I mean, you know, there's, for somebody to want to be 
[01:20:30]  slapped, there's obviously some kind of underlying psychological thing that somebody maybe in the  past that they don't even remember happened to them that is coming out.  So what are you doing after work?  Smack on the way around a little bit?  No, why not?  All right.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Thank you, Frank.  No problem.  Okay, thank you.  James is on line four, and we've had this argument before, Opie.  Yeah, Emily, I'm going to let you go for now, okay?  All right, take care, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Because you've got to set these people straight. 
[01:21:00]  James.  Yeah.  What do you want to say?  Yo, I don't mean to, like, backpedal you guys or anything, but that guy that was talking  about the faces of death and all that, saying that it's fake?  Yeah.  Yo, that's a bunch of bull, man.  Dude, faces of death is fake.  What are you talking about?  Fake.  The real stuff they show, and they show news footage of a plane crash or news footage  of carnage on the highway, that's real.  Well, the stuff where the monkey was being, having his head beaten in so they could eat  monkey brains or the alligator attacking the guy, fake, fake, fake.  What about, did you see the one with the guy when they tied him to the two trucks? 
[01:21:30]  Fake, fake.  Well, what are you talking about?  They ripped his friggin' arms off and then they shot him.  Fake, fake, fake.  How are you going to fake that?  They faked it.  Faces of death is fakeses of death, Opie.  I'm saying fakeses of death.  See how clever?  No, no, no.  Thank you, James.  Fake.  All right.  All right, you guys suck.  I hate when people think that's real.  Trash.  Well, we're going to move on here.  You see this?  You ever go to The Onion?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  On the web?  I love The Onion.  Very funny.  They have Vince McMahon's X-Span.  X-Span.  At a press conference Monday, pro-wrestling tycoon and entrepreneur Vince McMahon unveiled his latest broadcasting venture,  X-Span, a 24-hour cable network that promises in-your-face extreme lawmaking coverage that puts C-Span to shame.  McMahon says, get ready for bone-crunching, smash-mouth, 21st-century lawmaking.  C-Span's for wimps.  They're a bunch of grannies. 
[01:22:30]  X-Span.  New in-your-face 24-hour congressional cable channel.  You've got to see this.  Go to The Onion and read this.  It looks really funny.  Look at the cheerleaders.  They'll have ex-representatives from all 50 states that will introduce Bill to the big, bad house of pain.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  And another move designed to stoke viewer interest legislators will be allowed and even encouraged to date Senate pages.  A bevy of short-skirted former strippers dubbed Gloss, the gorgeous ladies of senatorial service.  These gals, McMahon said, are real sluts.  McMahon also promised to make congressional races more exciting  by lifting restrictions on soft money, electioneering,  and throwing dust into an opponent's face to blind him. 
[01:23:30]  He de-emphasizes boring old ethics.  Very good.  The X-Span forfeits.  You hear them backpedaling?  Yeah, a little bit.  On the XFL, a little bit, a little bit.  Looks like they're really having trouble keeping this thing going.  We'll have to wait and see.  Pete wants to talk about that psych guy really fast.  Pete, make it fast, right?  Yeah, I just...  Every time somebody says they like something, 
[01:24:00]  you've got a psychiatrist saying,  oh, this and this and this.  Just accept it.  They like to get slapped.  Slap them and have fun.  All right, there you go.  All right?  Thanks, Pete.  All right.  I got to agree, though.  There's got to be something somewhere in the head  if you really like it smacked in the face.  You've got to think it stems from...  Yeah.  From somewhere.  From somewhere in your past.  Whether real abuse or imagined or just, you know,  you were kept in your room too long.  I don't know.  Right.  But if you like being slapped about the face.  And a quick reminder,  the Best Ass Contest starts Monday. 
[01:24:30]  Ladies, come on down and show off your boot tag.  You have all week to show off your ass.  And then we'll narrow it down to the finalists.  And then we'll have the listeners vote.  Just like the Best Boob Contest.  So, ladies, any day next week between 3 and 7,  just show up.  You don't have to call and say,  I'm showing up.  Just show up.  And just show up.  And show us what you got.  Okay?  We got some great, great prizes,  including a trip to Vegas.  Anthony, in a few minutes, 5 o'clock?  Oh, it's later?  Okay.  We have Michael from Survivor. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  The guy that burned his hands and his face.  Hunted the pig.  Hunted the pig.  Did some pigging.  He's going to be calling our show around 6 o'clock today.  So, we're looking forward to that.  Yeah.  Very cool.  And more of your phone calls,  212-757-1027.  O.B. and Anthony.  This is good.  O.R. and Y.  That is country.  Look at this.  We were just talking about Mr. McMahon.  And on the hotline, Vince McMahon. 
[01:25:30]  Gentlemen.  Hey, Vince.  What's going on?  I hear you're talking about me and the XFL.  Well, it's not looking too good for you right now.  Well, now, we're taking it on a week-by-week basis.  And let me just tell you this.  Future games in the XFL are going to be fascinating.  Why are they going to be fascinating?  We're incorporating some new things.  Yeah, like what?  Into the XFL.  Yeah?  Well, I heard you boys talking about landmines on the football field. 
[01:26:00]  Well, it's an old joke.  How interesting would it be if one of the New York, New Jersey hitmen are streaming across the field,  heading toward the end zone, and hit a landmine?  I'd watch every week, sir.  See?  This is going to get the XFL back the way it should be.  Smash mouth, blowing up football.  The way it's supposed to be played.  So, you're thinking landmines will help everything, huh?  Landmines.  What else?  Well, we're taking the cheerleader aspect to a whole new level.  Well, I was reading in the paper.  You're already going to have cameras in the locker rooms when the cheerleaders are doing their thing. 
[01:26:30]  That's tame.  Tame stuff.  Now, nude coke whore cheerleaders.  Nude coke whore.  They'll be in the stands where we will have cocaine vendors.  Yeah?  Selling cocaine that you can redeem with a nude coke whore cheerleader.  And this will help the TV ratings?  If you could go to a game and purchase cocaine,  then give it to a coke whore who will give you sex. 
[01:27:00]  You're not going for the price of a ticket.  It's the XFL.  Coke whore smash mouth football.  It sounds like you're a little desperate, sir.  Desperate, no.  Yeah.  I'll be desperate in two weeks if this doesn't work.  And my darling daughter Stephanie is one of the coke whores.  Ah.  Any chances of seeing her nude at halftime at one of these games, sir?  Well, if those ratings dip any lower, she'll be on that field. 
[01:27:30]  Redeeming cocaine for oral favors.  Sharpshooters.  Sharpshooters.  Sharpshooters in the upper deck.  You notice in the XFL games, the crowd looks sparse in the upper deck.  Well, yeah, you don't sell those tickets, I hear.  Wouldn't you like to go to a game if we were giving out sniper rifles?  Putting you in the upper deck.  So if maybe you're upset with a coach or a player, you take them out. 
[01:28:00]  Take them out!  That's not a bad idea.  Or if the opposing team is running for the goal line.  Hey, pick them all.  Fair game.  Think about fair game, huh?  Fair game.  Smash mouth sniper football the way it's supposed to be.  Well, that would help the ratings, sir.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  It's going to be fascinating.  Yeah.  Bear traps.  Bear traps.  Bear traps in the end zones.  Wouldn't it be fun?  I mean, as a child, you laughed at the cartoons that stepped in the bear trap. 
[01:28:30]  Wouldn't you just laugh your balls off if a player stepped in a bear trap, slammed shut, maybe cutting off a foot?  Why don't you go one step further and get the sharpened bamboo to just kind of shoot up from the ground?  Well, that's in the other end zone, Opie.  Yeah.  Pungie steaks!  Wiped with my own feces!  Just like the gooks.  And, of course, a lot of people upset with New York's Rusty Tillman. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  If you're upset with a coach, why not a halftime execution by guarantee?  Right on the 50-yard line?  Yeah, absolutely.  Right in the middle of the field.  You know, a lot of people upset because there's nothing you can do when your coach isn't performing.  Now, if you vote them down, we'll have like a thumbs up, thumbs down.  Kind of like the gladiator.  The gladiator thing.  Very popular, yes.  And if you thumbs down the coach, he dies! 
[01:29:30]  Guillotine football!  The way it's supposed to be played.  I do believe you finally have a hit on your hands.  Well, I am getting a little desperate.  It sounds like you're going a little nuts.  It's, hey, porn star players.  Porn star players.  How about that?  A lot of people check it in saying XFL is horrible, the hitmen blow.  Well, that's why I'm spicing it up.  Yeah, okay.  Also, I'm looking into X Weather Channel. 
[01:30:00]  X Weather Channel.  The Weather Channel taken to the extreme.  And what would happen on X Weather?  Co-core weather broadcaster.  I'm really running with this Co-core thing.  Yeah, I noticed that.  Everyone loves a good Co-core, even Vince McMahon.  I'm trying to turn my wife, Linda, into a Co-core.  Hey, I got an idea for the weathermen.  If they're wrong with the forecast, they die live on TV.  They die!  They die!  They die! 
[01:30:30]  So, you watch.  All right.  You watch how the ratings pick up on the XFL.  Very nice.  Rated XFL!  All right, Vince.  Rape and Pillage FL!  Or something.  Okay.  Working on that.  All right.  Vince McMahon.  Thank you, boys.  Make sure you take your Prozac, sir.  Oh, damn.  I almost forgot.  Co-core!  All right.  Thank you.  Vince McMahon, everyone.  That's what you got? 
[01:31:00]  I think you're done to something now, huh?  Yeah?  Well, I would definitely watch if some of those things were put in place.  You know?  I like the Co-Core's angle.  I like the Co-Core's angle.  If you go to a game and you can purchase some Coke from the vendors, like Vince said, he's  going to start doing, and then redeem it with Co-Core cheerleaders for oral favors, 
[01:31:30]  who's not showing up?  I even think that Mushnik guy would be into that.  I like the X-Weather thing.  X-Weather.  Where the weathermen are wrong, they die.  Ah, he needs death in the game.  Let's go to Phil.  Phil, what's going on?  The way to improve the XSL?  Yeah.  Mine the field.  That's what Vince said.  You don't know when one's going to go off.  Vince said that.  Ah, well, that's going to bring ratings up. 
[01:32:00]  I believe he's taking a cue from George Carlin.  George Carlin suggested that.  Mining the football field.  Yeah, there you go.  I like the sniper, too.  That's a great idea.  The sniper thing could be fun.  That should be some type of contest, though.  They give, you know, two sniper rifles out.  One for the home team and one for the away team.  Wow, that would be nice.  Yeah.  Rusty versus Jesse in a steel cage match?  Yeah, that would be good.  Poor Rusty. 
[01:32:30]  Back to you, Rusty.  Andy!  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I hear that if a player doesn't make a pass,  he gets a live crucifixion on the middle of the field.  Oh, a crucifixion.  That?  Yeah, on the Sunday game.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you.  Ryan, what's going on?  Good.  Hey.  Hey, Ryan.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony, where were you, man?  Doing an interview.  He was right.  I hope he was doing a good job,  so I just kind of laid back.  Is he talking to the boss?  No, he's right here.  All right, guys. 
[01:33:00]  I usually have a problem when Ant leaves the studio,  but this time he was right in front of me.  I'm hanging.  I'm hanging.  He's checking out buddwire.com.  You know.  Joey, what's going on?  Yo, that league sucks.  Well, yeah.  That is awful.  They should put an S in front of the hitmen.  That is an awful team.  The poor hitmen.  Yeah.  They are horrible.  Well, we like Rusty and the gang.  He's a dope.  Rusty's a dope.  He's a dope.  He's a nice guy.  He's dope, man.  All right.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  Thank you.  So he's having a little trouble.  Ant, do you know a guy named Don Dino?  Don Dino.  Don Dino.  Yes, this is Don Dino.  Hello, Don Dino.  Is this Anthony?  Yeah.  Anthony, I heard you're disgracing the family.  I hope this is not true.  That is the worst impression of any kind of crime, Don, I've ever heard.  What do you want, Don Dino?  Anthony, I'm giving you an order for me.  I want you to take care of the family while I'm gone. 
[01:34:00]  He's so horrible.  What are you doing, you asswipe?  I'm an asswipe.  You wipe my ass.  When I tell you to wipe it.  All right.  Dead man, Don Dino.  Thank you, Don Dino.  Thank you, my friend.  He won't step out of character, Opie.  No, he's in character.  I see that.  XFL, two words.  Tax write-off.  I don't know about that.  The stock, they had an article on the WWF stock today in the paper. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, pretty bad.  Plummeting.  Taking a major hit.  Might be a good buy.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not playing that game anymore.  No, I know.  Hey, yeah, it went down.  It's a good buy.  A year ago, I'm like, wow, WWF stock going down a lot.  I'm picking up.  They're looking at this XFL thing.  Looks like it's pretty cool.  Goodbye.  People are nervous because the XFL is not really taking off.  Then we'll get rid of the XFL, and WWF will be strong as ever.  The stock will go back up. 
[01:35:00]  It's a good buy.  I like it.  I like it.  I've given up.  I'm trying to figure out that market.  No, no, no.  And the XFL stock, I mean, I don't know.  Well, I don't see that the WWF has the popularity it had even a year or two ago.  Two years ago, I think it was really peaking, you know?  What, the WWF?  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I think they're strong as ever.  No, they're really strong, I'm just saying.  But it seemed like two years ago, they were really strong, and I think they've put a lot 
[01:35:30]  of energy into getting this XFL together.  Might have taken away from them.  Know what I mean?  I don't really get the pay-per-views anymore.  Matt from Westchester, man.  You're going to just get us in trouble.  Well, listen closely.  The players should run around the park for the end zone.  There you go.  Where the cheerleaders will be waiting, holding their panties.  All right. 
[01:36:00]  That's awesome.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Hey, watching the Hitman are a godsend.  It makes it less painful to watch the Jeff.  Easy with the Jeff bang.  Oh, come on.  Think about it.  Hey, that's good.  The Jeff's going to look great.  Easy with the Jeff bang.  If you take all the bad players from the New York area and put them on an XFL team,  you've got the XFL Hall of Fame.  Dave Brown, Boomer Esiason.  Come on. 
[01:36:30]  A number seven quarterback getting his ass kicked.  Giant Stadium erupting in booze.  It's like old times.  Come on.  Valeri makes Testa Verde just look like an all-star quarterback.  I mean, it's fantastic.  Thank you, Mike.  Relax.  He's enjoying that one too much.  Yep.  Speaking of football, the Cowboys letting Troy Aikman get loose?  Yeah.  So they don't have to pay him, what, like $7 million?  Troy Aikman's out of his mind.  He's had all those concussions and he wants to continue playing. 
[01:37:00]  He's 34 years old.  He's done it all.  And he doesn't know that it's over.  Some of the guys don't want to go out.  It's been their whole life.  So what are they going to do?  Get out and make a commercial?  Speaking of sports really fast, did you hear the latest rumor?  What?  Michael Jordan maybe coming back.  Making a comeback.  Ah, come on.  I've heard that.  Have you heard more info on that?  Just because he's starting to work out again,  they would pay him so much money to come back  and try to get the NBA back to where it was a few years back. 
[01:37:30]  I'm sure David Stern would give him an incentive to come back.  I'm sure.  Because the attendance is down.  The ratings for the NBA is just taking a nasty hit.  No one cares.  There's not a big name like that, like his was.  But they started this rumor yesterday  because they've noticed he's working out like crazy,  like six hours a day, three hours in the weight room or something,  three hours on the court.  They thought it was six hours.  Now they've narrowed it down to about three to four hours a day,  an hour and a half with weights.  Then he goes and plays a ball for an hour and a half. 
[01:38:00]  And they say that sometimes runs to three hours  because, you know, all the people come in  and he starts playing more games and stuff like that.  But supposedly he's using his conditioning coach  from when he was playing with the Bulls.  Maybe the guy just got out of shape.  Wants to get back into shape.  He just wants to get back into shape.  I mean, Charles Barkley, he retired and he blew up.  He's a fat pig.  Maybe he's looking at Barkley going,  nah, he's huge now.  Have you seen Barkley?  No.  Oh.  Really?  So maybe he looks at his buddy Barkley 
[01:38:30]  and realizes how fat Barkley's getting  and then he looks down at his own body  going, hey, I'm getting a little fat.  I'm just going to get back into shape.  Not going to get the endorsement deals like he gets  if he's big and fat?  They say Jordan doesn't need the money.  No.  He needs to compete probably.  Yeah, that you can't.  But the story, I think it was on Fox or something yesterday  and they're trying to figure out what team he would play for.  He can't play for the Wizards because he's a part owner.  There's no way in the world he would go back to Chicago  because that team blows. 
[01:39:00]  There's only one place he would go.  L.A.  and play for Jackson.  Now, he's part owner of the Wizards.  Right.  So, I mean, isn't that silly if he's on another team even?  Yeah, I don't know exactly.  How does that work?  I don't know exactly.  It would probably be better if he could play for the team that he owns  because then he would play to his full potential just like he should.  Yeah, but see, if Jordan comes back,  I don't think he's coming back.  I don't know, dude.  He left under perfect circumstances.  Winning shot for a title. 
[01:39:30]  Twice he did that.  You're right.  I don't know.  Third time's the charm.  I don't know.  I don't see it.  But if he's coming back, he's going to come back to a contender.  He doesn't want to, like, hang out with a sucky team.  It would be so unfair if he joined the Lakers.  Good God.  Tommy says he's going to the Lakers.  Tommy.  What's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Now, I heard rumors he was going to the Lakers.  They're playing the Phil Jackson again.  But that's so stupid.  How many of you have, 19 guys, all Hall of Famers? 
[01:40:00]  At that point, it wouldn't be fair.  I mean...  It's like the Yankees.  Yeah.  I'm a Yankee fan.  That's beautiful.  I love it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's like the Yankees.  It's not fair.  I'm a Yankee fan.  I love it.  But if it's other teams, it sucks.  All right.  Thank you.  I think Patrick Ewing's going to be upset that he's not going to be able to beat Jordan  as a Knick now?  Oh, loser.  Let it, boys.  Ewing can't beat anyone at this point.  He can't beat himself.  You know what would be great?  What's that?  If Jordan came back and joined the Knicks and helped them win a title, Ewing would be sitting  there going, that ain't happening. 
[01:40:30]  He would be climbing the Empire.  The only thing about Jordan, Jordan said there's only one coach he would play for, and that's  Phil Jackson.  Let's quickly go over to the fan.  Maggie, run around the park forever.  Run around the park forever, Maggie.  Well, you've got to squeeze a little sports in, just a little bit.  We don't go...  That is a fetish.  We don't go too crazy.  We just touched the surface as far as these sports stories go.  We don't go too deep.  Unbelievable.  I mean, I'm a fetish girl coming in.  They like being smacked.  Maggie punched that bitch in the base. 
[01:41:00]  Now he's worth one for a rather.  You know, we discuss it for two minutes.  They discuss the same story for three days.  Our buddy Jim Norton coming in, going to smack this whore in the base.  Back to lumber, Maggie.  That's funny.  All right.  Yeah, hey, Mike's got a good one.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  You guys got it all wrong.  He's prepping to go back to the NBA. 
[01:41:30]  He's going to play in XFL.  You think Vince McMahon got a hold of him?  Can you imagine that?  Hey, it's not too far-fetched.  Like his baseball career.  Yeah, the guy tried baseball, so why not try some football?  Yeesh.  Tell me you wouldn't watch.  Jordan?  Yeah.  I'm a football player.  Oh, stop.  He would get his ass kicked.  He would get his ass kicked worse than Johnny Knoxville did on that last jackass.  Where he was returning a punt.  That is insane.  We were talking about a jackass during our FAHM interview today. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  That's going to come out, who knows, maybe six months from now or whatever.  And jackass, Johnny Knoxville, he's insane now.  Yeah, yeah.  They're really taking it to the limit.  And I mean, you know, the first season with the taser and stuff, yeah, that's off the hook, yo.  But now the second season, he's taking it to a whole new level.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, really in danger of hurting or killing himself.  Returning punts.  Those guys were slamming him.  He didn't even have blockers.  He didn't even return one. 
[01:42:30]  He had nothing.  He didn't even return one.  He couldn't even catch the ball.  And he tried catching the ball.  He did something that you should never do in football.  When you drop a ball, you should never look down.  He looked down.  Well, that was the last one.  Right.  They couldn't even punt on the ball anymore, so they were just throwing it to him.  Like the quarterback would just wail one at him.  And all these guys rushing at him.  He tries to catch it.  It hits him in the chest, goes right through his arms, and hits the ground.  So he looks down to pick the ball up, and right when he looks up and looks forward again, 
[01:43:00]  he got a face full of this huge guy.  Just slammed him.  Went right down.  Elbows, heads.  You know, that was a pretty sick episode, segment of Jackass.  Yeah, that was a good one.  But not as sick as the high lie with the oranges.  Yeah, they were taking the high lie things, the big scooper things, putting oranges in them  and wailing them at Johnny Knoxville's back.  Hit the back of his knee.  Took him right out. 
[01:43:30]  Took him right out like it might as well have been a shotgun.  I don't know how far they're going to go with that show.  Have you seen the police dog attack yet?  No, where he dresses like a bunny.  It was one of Johnny Knoxville's guys.  I didn't see that one.  The guy that likes to get naked all the time for some reason.  I think they call him Naked Guy.  Naked Guy?  He's in a bunny suit.  Anyone else see this?  The bunny suit?  And then they let the attack dog go?  Yeah.  Just mauls him.  And there was this one part of it where the attack dog rips the bunny head right off the guy's costume. 
[01:44:00]  And even the trainer, because they got the safe word, I guess, because the dogs get really riled up.  And so the trainer comes running over because he just ripped the head off the guy and he's a little freaked out.  He's giving the dog the safe word, but he's kind of scared, waiting for the word to sink into the dog so the dog will stop.  Yeah, the dog's the one to, like, tear your friggin' throat out.  Well, you get your energy that high, you know, it takes you a little bit to calm down. 
[01:44:30]  Let me go to Phil.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, Phil.  Ugh.  Hey, how long?  Hold on.  This might be Phil.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, buddy.  What about one other guy, Bam Man, Majera, beats up his father?  Yeah, Bam is my favorite on Jackass, by the way.  Yeah, when he does all that stuff to his father, gosh, hilarious.  That was pretty funny.  Yeah, the lawnmower, the riding lawnmower where they made the hole and covered it up and you couldn't tell because there was leaves and stuff on the lawn and the father went falling into the hole. 
[01:45:00]  What about when he runs into the father's bedroom and just wails on him?  Yeah, the guy will be asleep on the bed and he jumps on him and just starts punching him in the head.  And the father wakes up like, ah, get off of me.  Yeah.  All right, later, folks.  Thank you.  I thought at the end of the first season, Jackass was starting to get kind of lame, but they picked it up.  It is really, really good this year. 
[01:45:30]  Now, whenever someone's in danger of death, it makes it entertaining.  That's for sure.  Hmm.  Lame's evil.  Come on.  What's that?  Jeff, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Yo, did you see the episode where he stapled Jackass through this?  He stapled Jackass to his butt.  Yeah, he used the stapler to staple up.  He took letters and then he...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait, but Jeff, that wasn't the sickest thing. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, no, that's right.  He had an enormous pain.  And then the guy just told him to keep going.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  No, the sickest thing I've ever seen on regular TV, I think.  I'm surprised MTV showed that.  You know what?  We're always saying when they suck.  Yes.  Bravo to MTV.  Well, I don't know if I wanted to see it, but...  But it was twisted.  You had a look.  They pierced a guy's butt, took his cheeks, pinched them together, and pierced it with 
[01:46:30]  a barbell until his butt was pierced closed.  And you saw the skin stretching and bleeding.  It was sick.  And then they take it out after it's done and put a piece of gauze padding there and  it starts bleeding from around the gauze.  It looks like a prison race.  The guy is just bleeding.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  Did you see when he was testing out the cup and all the little kids were winding up to  kick him in the junk?  Yeah, that was pretty funny, too. 
[01:47:00]  And did you see the spring-loaded sledgehammer?  Uh, yeah.  He was not...  He's not going to be able to have kids.  I don't know.  That's crazy.  Later, fags.  All right.  Faggy.  Bravo to jackass, fellas.  Remember when we did the...  It's good.  We stood out in a driving range.  At the golf course.  We dressed up in, like, hockey equipment and other stuff and stood out on a driving  range with about...  Would you consider this the wackiest bit we've ever done?  We try not to do wacky bits.  This was probably one of the zaniest things we've done. 
[01:47:30]  Yes, a little wacky for us.  But it was cool.  It was for, like, a charity thing.  You know what?  And this was before jackass.  And we have video.  Yeah.  That they would play on MTV tomorrow because it was pretty sick.  But I remember I was so scared of getting hit in the junk that I took a big steel frying  pan and duct taped it right over my crotch.  And I will never forget the sound it made and the relief I felt when one of the shots,  a line shot, man, right off the frying pan. 
[01:48:00]  It made a bong sound.  I looked down and saw when I had a duct tape, it hit the duct tape and made, like, a hole  in the duct tape where the golf ball hit.  And it was right where my sack was.  Now, you guys don't understand how scary this was.  We were in full, like, hockey goalie gear, frying pans on our junk.  We had every inch of our body covered with just arms, legs, heavy, heavy pads.  Guys, we stood about 100 to 120 yards away and we had, how'd it be, 50 guys?  I was going to say, like, 40.  All right, 40 or 50 guys all hitting golf balls at the same time in us. 
[01:48:30]  And some of them real ringers.  I mean, that could slam these balls.  The line shots that just stay five feet off the ground for 200 yards.  You know, those things that just, whoo, and they defy gravity.  You see it coming at you, but it's coming so fast, there's no way you can move.  And it hits you and you're just convinced you're dead.  Yeah.  No joke.  You're like, oh, I'm done.  Then you're amazed.  And then you're like, wow, that didn't hurt.  It's really bizarre.  The first one that hits you, you're all scared and stuff. 
[01:49:00]  And then the first one that hits you, you're like, oh, wow, that didn't hurt.  But it's going to hurt when it hits me on the kneecap or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the ones that would just whiz by our head?  Oh, yeah.  And you would hear the sound of...  Oh, my God, it's TIE Fighter.  Yeah.  That was pretty scary, though.  Maybe we'll have to pull something wacky out like that again, O.P. 
[01:49:30]  I don't know how wacky it is, because it was really scary.  Yeah.  It was fun for the people that were doing it.  And there were times we got hit, it knocked us right over.  Like, boom, we were, you know, knocked right over.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Yeah, we can do it again.  We did it for a charity.  It was for a good cause.  We raised a lot of money.  Yeah, and like I said, it was fun for the people that were doing it.  I mean, if you're in a driving range, what would be more fun than aiming at people?  Yeah.  Really?  You know, who hasn't taken shots at the poor ball collector guy in the little cage golf cart? 
[01:50:00]  And remember, we started like 200 yards out, because even though we were like, you know,  had all this padding on, we were still scared.  And then Ann and I, we got a little braver, and we kept moving up, moving up, and we got  about 100, 110 yards away.  It was our closest.  Yeah.  It was just insane.  Insane.  It's so funny when you take a shot on the, take a shot on the course, and you see a ball's  going to somebody. 
[01:50:30]  The four!  Stupid thing to yell.  The four, have a look out!  Holy ash!  And the thing's just going right for them, and they're just standing there, and you  see the whole thing happening.  That lands a foot away from them, and they give you that, what the F, look.  Horrible.  They either step on your ball and hit it back to you.  Yeah.  Jeff, I'm really terrible at it, so I don't know where the ball's going.  It's coming right for us!  I don't know where it's going after I hit it.  So, just say, hey, look out.  Jeff, what's up? 
[01:51:00]  Hey, guys, I'd pay some good money to knock a few balls at you.  That'd be hysterical.  Yeah, was it called, what was it, the take a shot at Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, because we'd take a shot at everyone else.  Yeah, it was the gag.  Your chance to get revenge.  You could do it, like, you know, 50 bucks for Gay Marco, you know, 100 bucks for Stinky,  you know, 500 bucks for you guys.  Yeah, I would consider doing it again.  It was scary, but I would do it again.  And those shots five feet off the ground?  Worm burners.  Yeah, I know.  Dishes.  Thanks, Jeff.  Thank you, guys. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  Wait a second.  You mean a Boston charity actually accepted donations from your show?  Yeah.  How's that for a topper?  From Sarah.  That's someone that pays attention.  Ho, ho, ho!  How's that for a topper?  Ho, ho!  Charities usually don't take our money.  Which amazes me.  I mean, we've talked about it.  It just amazes me.  Yeah, and you want to take free money.  We try to do a charity.  No one ever wants our money, so screw it.  Now we just go out and have fun.  Like our road show is coming up. 
[01:52:00]  Really fast.  When we were putting out Demented World,  we had to find a charity.  And what was it, the Jimmy Fund, Ben?  The Jimmy Fund, who solicits donations in movie theaters.  I mean, you'd be sitting in a movie,  waiting for the movie to start.  The lights would come up.  Someone walks in front of the theater and goes,  Hi, I'm blah, blah, blah from the Jimmy Fund.  We're going to send a couple of people to walk around.  To guilt you into using your remaining Jujube money  to help cure Jimmy.  Right.  So we contacted Jimmy Fund, 
[01:52:30]  because we're in Boston,  and that's the hometown, I think, of the Jimmy Fund, right?  All right.  Did you say Jujube?  No, I'm going to get to the,  I'm going to get to the Shwuggie story in a second here.  Shwuggie?  Remember the Shwuggie story?  It felt like a map.  What?  The Shwuggie.  We won't say who said it,  but we've got to tell the story.  Bruce Mittman, why?  All right.  Good.  So we approached the Jimmy Fund.  We're like,  Hey, we're going to put out this CD.  It's going to sell like hotcakes.  We're going to make a lot of money. 
[01:53:00]  We'll give you,  I think it was like a dollar or two bucks a CD.  We're going to just give to the Jimmy Fund.  It's like getting 50 grand for nothing.  50?  It was over a hundred.  For a dollar a CD.  Yeah, it was over a hundred thousand in the end.  Jimmy Fund said,  No, they didn't want to take our money.  So we're sitting there like,  You'd rather, you know,  watch kids suffer with the cancer and stuff  than take our money.  It may be a life.  And the answer is yes.  Yeah.  They proved by their actions  they would rather have children suffering with cancer  than accept Opie and Anthony's money.  Over a hundred grand. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  We were just floored that they wouldn't take our money.  So we started calling other charities in Boston.  No one would take our money.  Nope.  To make a long story short,  Demented World,  if you look closely on the labeling of our CD,  that's like three years old now,  the charity we finally found  was the Minority Homeless Veterans Association.  Not even the homeless vets.  It was the Minority Homeless Vets. 
[01:54:00]  Minority Homeless Vets.  Of Boston.  Of Boston.  It's not even for New York.  No.  They got...  There's not many minorities in Boston.  They got all the money.  They got all the money.  Because that was the only charity that would take it.  And the check presenting ceremony.  Right.  With our boss.  We didn't have to go,  but yeah,  we sold a ton of the CDs,  and it was time to, you know,  pay the Minority Homeless Veterans of Boston.  The big check.  The big check.  So our GM at the time,  Bruce Mittman, 
[01:54:30]  has to go down to their local headquarters.  Present that five foot by two foot big photo op check.  Now, he was pissed off at us at the time for something.  I don't even remember.  We were getting in a lot of trouble back then.  We just never got it back then, especially.  So we're doing our radio show,  and Bruce Mittman comes walking into the studio with the big check.  And he goes,  I don't know why I'm doing this for you guys,  but I got to present this check to a bunch of shwuggies. 
[01:55:00]  When he said that,  I lost it.  And the picture of the mid...  Boys,  but here's this little Jewish guy.  I swear to you guys,  three feet tall.  The picture,  it's out there somewhere.  I don't think it made the main papers,  but like a local paper.  Yeah.  There's a picture of our midget GM,  because he was like,  like Anthony said,  about five,  two,  five,  three,  sitting there,  putting on a fake smile,  surrounded by a bunch of shwuggies. 
[01:55:30]  Shwuggies?  That's his holds in the big check.  These are like some ancient Tuskegee airmen pilots  that are just like standing there going,  I remember back on P-51,  I was getting out of the Mustang  when all of a sudden,  me and our squadron of shwuggies  swept down the goddamn dravins.  I'm back there for the future.  Let me tell you about it.  We win the war.  And there's this three-foot little Jewish guy going,  boys,  boys,  boys,  I don't know how I get stuck presenting the check to the shwuggies, 
[01:56:00]  but the shwuggies?  Shwuggies.  I will never forget that word.  Hey,  it was Boston.  Everyone talks about it.  Screen name up for grabs today.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  I don't even know how do you spell shwuggie.  Boys,  boys,  my shwuggies.  That guy was classic,  man.  Let me tell you something.  I remember a storm on the beaches.  The guy would just like,  we'd have these just rocking shows with corn and limp biscuits.  He'd be backstage smoking pot with us. 
[01:56:30]  This guy was the most like business guy,  but he was a midget.  And he drove this big friggin' suburban.  He had the biggest car in Boston.  Because he was so short.  And we used to joke on the air that he needed a stepladder to get into it and stuff.  Yeah,  you see the door open and one of those rope ladders unroll.  No joke,  because he looked ridiculous behind the wheel of this truck.  Yeah,  and then at the shows,  because we used to do a lot of the parties with the bands and stuff up there, 
[01:57:00]  corn plated a few and stuff.  And there's Brucie,  just partying it up like a madman with everybody.  Hey boys,  how you doing?  Any pot boys?  Boys,  that's what he called his boys.  B-b-b-b-boys.  Boys,  have you seen Ozone?  I need some pot boys.  Boys.  Listen,  the nicest town.  Yeah,  he lived in a really like snootin',  highfalutin' area where there were no shwuggies at all.  No.  No shwuggies. 
[01:57:30]  Here he is.  Ooh,  ooh.  I'll never forget him walking into that studio that day with a big check.  I gotta present this check to the shwuggies.  The shwuggies.  Is that horrid?  He sounded like Ted Knight.  Boy.  He definitely sounded like Ted Knight.  I gotta bring it to the shwuggies.  Right.  Is that clear?  Carl,  what's up?  Hey,  I know where the term four came from.  I don't know about shwuggie, 
[01:58:00]  but I can tell you where four came from.  Yeah.  He used to work at a golf course during college with this old Scottish guy.  He's kind of like that McTavish from Caddyshack.  Yeah.  He says the Scots used to...  No, you dick!  That's right.  You know,  that gopher,  gopher,  Denny.  Huh?  They used to fire cannons when they'd fight between the clans,  and before they'd shoot them,  they'd yell,  before the cannons.  So the guys would duck.  After a while,  they got tired of yelling before the cannons,  they just said,  for the cannons,  and then finally they said four,  then they stopped shooting at each other 
[01:58:30]  and started playing golf and yelled four.  So,  not a lot of yucks,  but that's exactly what it was.  Well,  there you go.  How about that?  You know,  in those days,  they called it golf without the L.  Golf without the L.  I haven't seen that movie in...  Okay, guys,  you rule.  I haven't seen that movie in two weeks.  It was given to me  by the Knights of St. Andrews.  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Shwoogie.  It's like a morag.  It's in the hole! 
[01:59:00]  Let's go to Steve.  A lot of Steve's checking in today.  Steve,  what's going on?  Yeah,  I'm laughing my ass off over here.  The proper pronunciation for that word,  the Yiddish derivative of that is Shwoogie.  Shwoogie?  Yeah,  yeah,  Shwoogie.  But he would be Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie,  yeah.  It's a Yiddish word.  Basically,  the best interpretation,  it means shadow.  Playing word for black men.  I got to give this big check,  boys,  to the shadows.  Yeah,  you guys will pick that.  The Shwoogies.  You know,  we never told that story on the air  because 
[01:59:30]  Brucey was unbelievable.  Yeah,  because here we are  doing a nice thing  for the minority  homeless vets  of Boston.  What about the time  we had a meet  with the gay guys?  We had a meeting  with three guys  from the gay,  lesbian,  you know,  glad or whatever  because of some  of the gay-oriented  things we were doing  on the show.  What gay bit?  Oh,  I know what gay bit.  Can we play the bit?  Which one was it?  Hi,  Mom,  I'm gay.  Hi,  Mom,  I'm gay.  All right,  hold on.  Mom,  hold on.  We're up,  swallow-er.  And we'll take a break. 
[02:00:00]  We'll take a break.  We'll get into that story.  And Bruce's name  for the gay guys.  Oh,  there was another group  we had to meet with.  We were always meeting  with groups,  but he's like,  I know,  but boys,  we have to meet  with the faggots.  He's trying to make it  feel like it's this big thing.  Faggots,  I just hope there's  no shwoogie faggot.  All right,  we'll tell that story next.  Stay there  and play,  Hi,  Mom,  I'm gay.  Okay,  where were we? 
[02:00:30]  Talking about,  I don't know how we got on that,  but talking about  our old GM,  Brucey Mittman,  and all the meetings  we used to have to take  with certain groups  back when we were up  in Boston.  The faggolas,  the shwoogies,  all the groups.  Behind closed doors,  though,  it was hilarious.  The fact that we needed,  the only charity  we could find  was the  Minority Homeless  Veterans of Boston  to give money to  because no one else, 
[02:01:00]  the Jimmy Fund  didn't want our money,  didn't want our stinking money  to help kids with cancer.  They'll solicit  movie theaters  so you could throw  your popcorn money  into a can,  but they didn't want  $100,000  from Opie and Anthony.  Blood money.  It's like taking it  from a terrorist.  So,  yeah,  we got the  Minority Homeless  Vets of Boston  on board,  and when we finally  got the money  to give them 
[02:01:30]  from CD sales,  a substantial sum,  we sent our GM  over there,  we were busy that day,  to give them  the big check,  the big photo op check.  Hey,  look at that.  And he said,  there's a shot of us  in our little goalie gear.  Oh,  yeah,  let me see that.  On the inside cover  of Demento World.  Let me see those pictures.  And he said,  why do I have to go  and give the check  to the shwoogies?  The shwoogies.  Shwoogies.  After we were on the air,  you know,  telling everyone  how nice we were  and how cool we are  because we were  raising money 
[02:02:00]  for the minority  homeless vets  and then behind  closed doors,  he was pissed  and telling us  that he had to deliver  the check to the shwoogies.  Yeah,  there we are  in our hockey outfit  with the frying pan.  Look,  see,  you can see the frying pan  taped to my crotch area.  All right.  Anyway,  Anthony,  I remember the third story,  by the way.  Oh,  you did?  Two words.  What?  Cancer Kids.  Oh,  no.  Not a funny story, 
[02:02:30]  but we'll explain  in a minute.  God.  First,  it was Bruce Mittman's  idea of getting us  out of some serious  trouble.  Yeah.  Go hang out  with Cancer Kids.  That'll make  everyone love us.  See,  if we have a photo op  and use  for children.  Hold on,  go to the gay thing first  and then we'll get  into Cancer Kids.  Well,  we'll finish up  the segment  on our old GM,  Bruce Mittman,  the midget,  and we did  Hi, Mom, 
[02:03:00]  I'm Gay.  Simple game.  A guy calls up  his mother  and says  that he's gay.  It's harmless.  Let me play it.  Okay.  And then we'll tell you  what happened  after this aired  in Boston.  Right.  All right,  Bob,  are you ready to play  Hi, Mom,  I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Now,  I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Never.  Are you gay?  Yeah.  No rope swallowing.  All right,  Bob,  let's give it a shot.  All right.  You got to try 
[02:03:30]  to convince her,  man.  All right,  I'll do my best.  Let's give your mom  a call,  man.  Hello?  Mom,  can you hear me,  darling?  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah,  well,  you sound awful funny.  Yeah,  I know.  All right.  Hey,  Mom,  you sitting down?  Why?  I got to tell you  something.  What?  Uh,  don't get nervous.  So,  it might be me  to tell you,  I was going to call,  I tell you when you  called earlier today.  Yeah?  Ah,  I'm gay. 
[02:04:00]  Oh,  you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby,  would you stop it?  You know,  I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you don't,  you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well,  you just had a child,  Bobby.  What?  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah,  okay.  You know,  I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly,  but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I got to tell you,  you know,  I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby,  are you with Donna? 
[02:04:30]  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell your father that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said  some terrible things about those people,  so what's the,  you know,  what's all of a sudden?  Well,  it's to throw everyone off,  you know?  Bobby,  I don't believe it.  However,  you know.  You still love me?  I've had enough heartache.  I think,  you know,  good luck.  You still love me?  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore,  huh?  Bobby,  what the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No. 
[02:05:00]  No.  Yeah,  all right,  all right.  Okay,  I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No,  I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah,  that's nice.  Yeah,  you do that.  Stand a long distance away,  will you?  I will,  out of arm's reach.  Bobby,  don't give me that balloon,  please.  You should break my hat when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah,  that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you,  too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  I got to get back to her quick, 
[02:05:30]  man.  She's going to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  Hey,  Bob.  Yeah.  Bob,  I'm gay.  I'm gay.  This guy sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time,  Bob,  I'm gay.  I don't know.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah,  I'm a,  I'm a twinkie,  Bob.  That's a twinkie.  That's how I got the throat this bad,  Bob.  And there you have it.  All right.  Hi,  mom.  I'm gay.  Mom,  darling.  Mom,  Bobby.  It's Bobby. 
[02:06:00]  And this was so,  wait,  someone's calling us out on something.  Uh,  and we'll explain.  Uh,  Joe.  Hey,  Joe.  I've been Anthony.  Yeah.  Listen,  I went through the health and mental world CD.  In there,  it says no English,  horrible shelter.  It doesn't say nothing about minorities.  Okay.  Very good.  But I'm telling you,  it was minority homeless veterans.  Yeah.  Also,  there's a picture of you guys in your,  uh,  golf outfits with the fine pan taped to Anthony's, 
[02:06:30]  uh,  groin region.  Right.  Great picture.  All right,  man.  See you later,  guys.  Thank you.  It does say on the cover,  benefit the New England shelter for homeless vets.  But I'm telling you,  it was the minority homeless vets.  Because our boss had to take a picture with the shwoogies.  There's a picture of him with the shwoogies.  All right.  So,  he played high mom,  I'm gay.  And all of a sudden,  a bunch of gay guys,  uh,  this organization comes out of the woodwork,  saying,  do you know how difficult it is for a guy to come out of the closet?  This should not be,  uh,  made,  uh,  fun of.  It's a very tough time for them to tell their parents. 
[02:07:00]  And you're making light of it.  Blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah.  Give me a big seat.  So,  if that happened down here,  yeah.  Our boss would say,  go F yourself.  Yeah.  They go,  they said,  they would say that.  Right.  But,  uh,  up there,  no.  Yeah.  They folded,  and,  and they,  they set up a meeting.  They set up a meeting between this,  uh,  gay guys.  Ah,  good.  Gay guy.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  us.  Hey.  In the boss's office.  Hey.  As the boss sat there. 
[02:07:30]  And the boss in front of everybody's like,  uh,  we have to,  um,  meet with the,  uh,  gay,  lesbian,  alliance,  uh,  whatever.  And then we get behind the closed doors,  and it's like,  all right,  how long is this going to last?  He goes,  I don't know,  the faggot isn't here yet.  He should be arriving shortly.  I'm sure the queer isn't going to take up much of your time,  boys.  The,  the homo faggot queer should be leaving well before showtime,  boys.  So then you fast forward another half hour,  and we're now in,  in the boss's office with,  uh, 
[02:08:00]  the gay guys.  With the gay guys.  And,  and the boss with his arms folded looking at us like he's pissed.  Yeah,  so he's got to look like he's all aggravated with us as the gay guys.  And we're sitting there like,  you son of a bitch,  ten minutes ago,  you're calling them faggots.  The gay guys are handing us pamphlets and books.  Dittos.  Dittos.  All kinds of reading material about how hard it is to come out of the closet.  Remember they wanted us to read a book,  I forgot,  I forgot,  but it was like Bernie's story.  Yeah,  yeah,  and it was about him coming out of the closet.  Look at the book,  we're like,  we're not reading books.  Like,  do you think we're going to read this? 
[02:08:30]  Oh,  you think we're actually going to sit and read it?  But,  but,  but,  we were just sitting there,  all dopey.  Uh,  yeah,  okay,  yeah,  we'll get through this.  All right,  thank you,  thank you.  Goodbye.  And finally,  we just said,  look,  we gotta go.  It's time to leave.  And Bruce,  he gets up,  thank you so much for enlightening us on the trials and tribulations of homosexuality and the various hardships one must endure.  And the boys are now more sensitive for the fact. 
[02:09:00]  I believe they're more educated.  Thanks for coming by and enlightening,  enlightening my boys.  Okay,  goodbye.  Goodbye.  Okay,  there,  the bunghole pirate's gone,  boys.  You can now go back on the air.  Please lay off the fags today.  Maybe hit the shwoogies.  You know,  you boys are never in trouble with the spics.  I'm very proud.  Uh,  boy.  Mick,  what's going on?  Yeah,  you guys got this guy on tape.  I gotta hear this guy's voice now.  The guy did our show a couple times in New York.  In New York, 
[02:09:30]  when we first got here,  he came into New York to do some business,  and we had him on the air.  And they're going,  how are my boys?  I wish I would have heard.  We'll try to dig up some tape with him.  All right,  thanks,  guys.  All right,  buddy.  Bye.  CBS is back on the phone.  Boys,  some gooks are calling,  complaining about some of your various Asian bits.  I think we gotta talk to,  God,  I want to,  talk to Michael from Survivor,  Anthony.  Yes.  And then we'll talk about a story that's just not funny, 
[02:10:00]  but it'll give you a little insight.  You know,  as we were kind of getting our thoughts together during commercials,  you brought this up,  and I'm thinking about it,  and things are coming back to my memory that I blocked out.  Because this was just one of those things that I didn't want to be part of.  It was horrible.  We walked out.  We walked out.  We did walk out.  After they brought Billy.  Little Billy.  All right.  All right,  little Billy.  Stop it.  We showed we had hearts that day.  We finally reached our limit. 
[02:10:30]  Boys.  Like,  let,  boys.  Do we have to talk to Michael now?  I'm just waiting.  Can you just put them on hold?  Rick?  That's it?  Michael?  Hey,  how are you?  Who's that?  What's up,  man?  It's Opie and Anthony in New York City.  Opie and Anthony live.  You guys are legendary.  Ah.  This is,  of course,  Michael from Survivor,  the guy that had his hands melting in front of everyone's eyes last week.  How are you?  I'm doing great. 
[02:11:00]  I'm back to playing hockey and playing basketball.  I started baseball season yesterday.  Everything's good to go.  Not much damage?  Permanent?  My hands are pink,  and I have some minor scarring on my hands,  which I call my Australian tattoos.  But other than that,  I'm doing good.  I got to say,  before last week's episode,  I wasn't digging the Michael.  You were a little psychotic,  Michael.  You know,  I got to tell you,  you know,  yes,  everything that I was shown doing,  I actually did.  You know,  they didn't manufacture any of that, 
[02:11:30]  but,  you know,  I'm just a little prankster,  and I was just having fun with a lot of that stuff,  and out there,  you know,  you need to cut it up a little bit  and break.  Uh-oh.  Hello?  Call waiting.  Michael?  Yeah,  I don't know.  It wasn't on my end.  All right.  But I just think I got taken a little bit too seriously out there.  You know,  everybody that knows me said,  oh,  that was hilarious,  and,  you know,  the rest of the world,  or a lot of the world,  you know,  took that a little bit too seriously.  Michael,  now,  there's a lot of people that are saying that the pig that you killed was drugged, 
[02:12:00]  and that it was moving a little too slow.  What do you have to say about that?  I got to tell you this.  Yeah.  Our tribe,  we had caught almost 50 fish at this point.  The other tribe had caught six or seven.  We had 11 eggs at this point.  We had four chickens.  We had a pig.  We had the chicken feed,  and we had won all the soup mixes and all those spices.  Why in the world would CBS throw the pig in our camp?  The drugged pig.  The drugged pig.  So that's the first.  Secondly, 
[02:12:30]  when Mark Burnett,  hopefully he does,  releases the unedited version of that pig hunt,  the whole world would see it was a three-day pig hunt.  I was out in the canoe at 4.30 in the morning,  finding out where that thing,  you know,  came to eat.  I watched it drink.  I watched its tracks.  It was a two-hour pig hunt.  It charged me twice.  It knocked me over.  It tried to bite me.  I mean,  it was a very action-packed hunt.  That pig was not on any kind of medication.  And it took three days.  It took three days for me to actually find out where it was, 
[02:13:00]  where it ate,  and all that stuff.  Right.  Now,  Michael,  if you heard at the beginning of the interview,  said we're legendary.  Oh,  really?  Michael,  is it because of our Kel interview?  You know,  it's funny,  you know,  I had called Kel and I said,  Kel,  what happens when you get kicked off?  I mean,  what do you do?  You know,  he was telling me about the early show and Extra and E.P.  and Richard Hatch and all this stuff.  And he said,  but I got to warn you,  there's this one radio station,  W. New,  out of New York.  He said,  don't do it. 
[02:13:30]  And I,  and I'm like,  okay.  And I just made a metal note of it.  The next morning,  I went on the internet on Survivor News.  There it was.  And I clicked on it.  And I'm like,  it was 15 minutes long.  And Deb Marcus and I listened to it five times.  I don't know if I've ever laughed so hard.  You were having such a pisser with him, man.  I like that guy that called in and said,  hey, Kel,  if rice ruined your sex drive,  why is there two billion Chinese people?  Yeah,  he was trying to say that he was so hungry  and just eating rice  and it made the sex drive go away. 
[02:14:00]  So he wasn't going out in the woods and spanking it.  I've got to tell you something, though.  In Kel's defense,  you know,  the sexual drive out there,  it's just not happening.  I mean,  you wouldn't even spend the energy doing it  because you didn't have enough energy  to make it on the two-and-a-half-hour walk  to Tribal Council.  Why would it hit the press  that he was caught masturbating by the crew, then?  You know,  I don't know  because he was in the other tribe  and we didn't hear,  I didn't hear a word about it  until,  you know,  it had come up on the show. 
[02:14:30]  And,  you know,  obviously,  he's not admitting to any of the beef jerky instances  out there.  And,  you know,  but again,  in his defense,  I would find it hard to believe  that he was really doing that  because it's just,  I'm telling you,  you are in a state of survival mode out there.  Your body just goes into survival mode.  And,  you know,  and I can say personally for myself  and I know from some of the other people,  that just,  that part of it's not happening.  He was right about that.  Well,  I believe you  because how are you going to do the,  do the hand thing with burnt hands?  Yeah, 
[02:15:00]  I'm going to suck.  Geez.  Well,  no,  the hand thing,  I couldn't eat,  I couldn't shave,  I couldn't,  you know,  I couldn't wash my hair.  Yeah.  It was,  it was tough.  I had to have 24-hour care  and,  you know,  I went through a very painful experience,  no doubt.  You couldn't,  you couldn't just like sense  that you were going to fall over into the fire  when you're falling on it?  I have since then learned  that when you inhale smoke  that it displaces,  it instantly displaces  the oxygen in your body  and it's very common to pass out.  I mean,  I have a fire pit in my backyard. 
[02:15:30]  I make 30 to 40 fires a year  and,  you know,  I'm a,  you know,  very seasoned veteran of fire  but I've never inhaled smoke like that.  I guess that's why people just drop dead.  You think,  oh,  if there's a fire,  I'll just run out of the house.  It doesn't take but one inhale  and you're down.  Yeah,  I'm telling you,  I have a new respect for that,  for the smoke inhalation part of it  and,  you know,  I,  you know,  I've taught my kids and my wife  because we still have fires in our fireplace  but when it comes to that smoke,  man,  I'm sure you're sick of telling the story  but for the New York audience,  basically you were stoking the fire 
[02:16:00]  trying to get it going again?  Yeah,  stoking the fire,  threw some dried leaves and twigs on it  and I was bent over blowing on it  and the smoke just starts to billow  through the dried leaves  before it actually catches flame  and the wind instantly changed directions  and as I was breathing in to blow on the fire,  the smoke went right in my face.  I'd breathe in a bunch of smoke  and I stood up.  I felt a little dizzy  which wasn't uncommon out there  because they were,  you know,  a little bit,  you know,  malnutrition  and a little dehydrated  and boom,  it's the last thing I remember  and because the fire just sapped 
[02:16:30]  all the oxygen out of my body,  I laid in that fire  for 10 to 15 seconds  convulsing in those flames  in that fire pit.  I mean,  it wouldn't even wake my body up  because my body  must have just shut down  from that smoke.  I mean,  it is amazing  that my face  and,  you know,  that I still even have fingers.  Well,  supposedly that floppy hat  that you were wearing  saved you  because it kind of  folded underneath you.  Yeah,  that old goober hat  that I was wearing out there,  who would have ever thought  that that would have been the thing 
[02:17:00]  and I very rarely wore it  and the sunglasses,  that hat's all burned  on the side  and my sunglasses  are all burned up  and I had a bunch of burns  on my face  but they're all mine  but I still have,  you know,  red marks  where the burns  were on my face too.  you should put that stuff  on eBay.  You know,  Rosie O'Donnell  asked me about that  on the Rosie show last week  about donating that hat  to her charity.  Oh my God,  you should hunt her.  That'd be great.  You wouldn't have to track her  that far.  I'd say Rosie sent  me and my family 
[02:17:30]  back to Australia  and I'm taking them  back to the outback  to where Survivor  was filmed  and going back  to the scene of the crime  and I'm going to take them  through the tribal council  and the fire pit  where I got burned  and where I caught the fish  and where the pig hunt was  and it's going to be  a really neat vacation  because the family  will watch the show  and see everything  and to go back there  will really kind of  bring closure  to the whole thing  for them.  Now,  did the crew see  a lane in the fire?  You know,  I know Mark took  a little bit of,  Mark Burnett took  a little bit of criticism  for that. 
[02:18:00]  You know,  everybody,  Mark's been working  with these guys  for seven years  and know the doctors  did not pick up  the cameras  and the cameramen  did not pick up  the medical bags  and everybody  had a job to do  and I mean,  like clockwork,  they were right there  within 60 seconds  they were dispatched  into a vehicle  that bought out  across the outback  and I mean,  they were right there  when they needed  to be there.  But no camera guy  was on you  at the time?  You know,  I don't really know.  You know,  remember there was,  at that point  there was six of us  out there  and there was,  you know,  probably two camera crews 
[02:18:30]  and a bunch of  hidden cameras  and,  you know,  you didn't,  it wasn't a one-on-one,  one camera  to one contestant  on you 24 hours a day.  I mean,  there was times  when you could have  escaped the fire  so I don't,  you know,  I mean,  I guess you'll have  to buy the DVD  to find out exactly  really what happened.  Ah,  look at that.  I mean,  I'm not getting  any money from it  but,  you know,  I'm certainly  going to buy it  because I'm not sure.  I asked Mark,  I said,  Mark,  I don't care  if you have  to lock me  in a room,  I want to see  the unedited  version of the burn  and I want to see  the unedited pig hunt.  Yeah,  Mark Burnett.  Yeah,  I heard you really  went off on that pig 
[02:19:00]  like they didn't show it  but you were stabbing it  how many times?  You know,  and as humanely  and as quickly as possible.  Ah,  that sounds like  the animal rights  activist people on you.  You know,  I mean,  I was obsessed  with hunger  and I did get  the pleasure  that it looked  that it appeared  that I got  from killing the pig  was the satisfaction  of being able  to provide food  for me and my tribe.  You should have gotten it.  I mean,  you're hungry,  you want to eat,  there's an animal  there for you 
[02:19:30]  and you kill it.  That's what people do.  You know,  I understand  it's a big fuss.  Most of these people  that are out there  on the warpath,  you know,  after they pick  at the stores,  they go to the grocery  store and buy  their pound of bacon  and eat their BLT's.  They just don't,  you know,  they're shielded  from the fact  of the,  you know,  the slaughterhouses  and the cruelty  of the animals  in the slaughterhouses.  They don't want  to know where  it came from,  right.  There's no real  humane way  to kill an animal.  Like they rock  a bye baby  the cows to sleep  before they put  the bolt  through its head.  Right.  I mean,  you know,  I respect the fact  that if that's 
[02:20:00]  their feelings  and, you know,  that they got to  do what they got to  do,  I just wish  they respected mine.  I think they're  just pissed  because the pig  you killed  looks like them.  Maybe that's it.  That's usually  the way it worked.  Now, Michael,  the other thing,  after you burned  your hands and stuff,  I mean,  how do you keep  it from your family?  It was about  three and a half weeks  before I arrived  back in the States  and I was wearing  these custom fit  burn gloves.  They're compression gloves  that you wear  after a burn  to prevent scarring.  Did you have  an incentive  to not tell your family?  No, 
[02:20:30]  Mark Burnett  supported any decision  I made.  He would have  flown my wife out there.  He would have  flown me home.  But it was  really important  for me.  I mean,  it would be like  reading the last  chapter of a book  before you read  a novel.  I mean,  to read the end  and then read  the middle,  it wouldn't mean  as much.  And it really  did have a  significant impact  on my life  and I wanted  my family,  my wife and kids  to go through  the experience  just like I did  so that they  could understand  how it really  affected me.  How did you  have to wipe?  I'm telling you,  any use of the hands 
[02:21:00]  was an issue  for the first  three and a half,  well,  I'd say for the  first two and a half  weeks.  Did someone have to  wipe your butt?  Did you need a nurse  to wipe you,  man?  The fortunate part  was,  and that's the  first time I've  been asked that  question.  Finally got one  the other man asked.  We finally got one.  But, you know,  you're not eaten  and fortunately  for the first  four or five days  I was in the hospital,  that was not an issue.  All right,  another week and a half  to go.  Yeah.  I had use of my hands 
[02:21:30]  so I was good to go.  Oh, you did?  I had use of my hands  at that point.  I thought maybe  you just dragged  yourself across the carpet  like a cocked spaniel.  That would have been  interesting, right?  Very good.  Wow.  Sounds great though.  I'm telling you,  this experience for  anybody out there  that's thinking about  applying for Survivor 3,  you know,  it is the greatest  experience you'll ever  go through to be  one-on-one with the  earth and, you know,  one-on-one with wild  animals and, I mean,  it's such a tremendous, 
[02:22:00]  it's not about the money,  it's not about the fame  or TV,  it's about the experience  and whether it ever  hits TV or not,  I mean,  it's the greatest  experience I've ever  thought of.  It sounds great  and you made it  interesting, you know.  Michael.  Yeah.  I saw a lot of your  interviews on TV  and it has come up  a lot.  You've been telling  a lot of people  you're like a changed  man from this  experience.  Why?  Well, for one thing,  you know,  when I went into the  ICU burn ward  and I was in there  with people that  had been burned  over 90% of their  body and, I mean, 
[02:22:30]  one guy,  I mean,  just, I mean,  limbs were burned  off and it was  just so,  to be face down  in a fire  where, you know,  when I pushed  myself up out  of the fire,  I buried my hands  deep into the  embers of the fire.  I mean,  I'm so lucky  and I felt  really fortunate  and the doctors  had me scheduled  for a series  of three skin  grafting operations.  When they took  the bandages  off my hands,  they were under  the black,  charred skin.  They saw, like,  you know,  little remnants  of pink,  fresh new skin  and they said  in 35 years, 
[02:23:00]  the top three  burn surgeons  in Australia  said they'd never  seen hands healed  like that.  And, I mean,  I prayed for two  hours a day  about my hands  and about,  you know,  the whole situation  and I'm telling you,  you know,  I really believe  that, you know,  I was, you know,  divinely healed.  I really do.  Ah.  I know, I mean,  I know it's a,  you know,  it's a wacky thing  to say on a radio station  but, I mean,  it really changed  my life.  It changed the way  that I look  at my family  and it changed  my perception  of people  and, you know, 
[02:23:30]  the things I would  take for granted  normally,  it really is a  very positive  experience in the long run.  All right.  We didn't stop  drinking and having  sex, did you?  I'm married.  I get to have that.  Oh, there you go.  We have an Aussie  native on the line  that just has a  question for you.  His name's Gavin.  Gavin, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  Here you go, Michael.  Hey, Michael,  I just,  I know you've been  out on the publicity  to it with this pig.  There is no way  that pig got lost.  You were set up. 
[02:24:00]  As much as you'd  like to leave,  you believe that  you chased it  for a couple hours.  Somebody set that up  before you got to it.  So, I hate to give  you the bad news.  Gavin, I appreciate  what you're saying.  I love that  Australian accent.  It brings back  some fond memories.  The reason that I was  able to one-on-one  get that pig,  and I've been,  I'm a wild boar hunter  from way back.  I've been on four or five  wild boar hunts  in my life,  and I know how fast  those guys are.  I had the uphill  advantage.  When I got to it,  I was on a hill,  and I had the uphill  advantage on it,  so it had to run 
[02:24:30]  uphill by me,  and I had it cornered  in the area where  it had to either go  swimming across the  river or charge me.  Well, I think  what an animal will do.  It charged me.  I put the knife  in its backbone.  I stabbed it  right in the back,  and it hit the plate.  It hit that plate,  that bony plate.  It tried to hook me  with its thoughts  because it ran by me,  but it ran back  downhill,  into a group of shrubs  where it felt safe,  and I was able,  after about 45 minutes,  to get it cornered again,  and that's when  I called Nick over, 
[02:25:00]  and it had to charge me  again,  and the second time  it charged me,  I was able to inflict  a wound in the side  of the neck,  and I hit an artery  in the side of the neck  that caused it to bleed,  and then it was just  a matter of putting  a couple more  knife wounds in  before the hunt  was done,  but absolutely,  positively,  Gavin,  you'll be the first  one I send  that unedited version  to if Mark ever  releases that video.  Yeah, yeah,  yeah.  Well, they're a top beast,  and I give you credit  for what you did,  that's for damn sure.  All right, Gavin,  thank you.  Thanks, everyone.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There is Mick Dundee. 
[02:25:30]  Check it in.  My God.  Hey, I met Donk over there.  Remember Donk?  Donk from  Crocodile Dundee.  The guy's lost  about 75 pounds,  and he owns a gym  over there,  and I went to,  right outside of Sydney,  I walked him  to a gymnasium,  and there's Donk.  He owns the gym.  Oh, yeah?  He just got done  filming Crocodile Dundee  Part 3.  It's coming out  in April, I guess,  but I met him,  and I couldn't tell him  where I was,  and I still,  we weren't allowed  to say anything  for the night  until we got back  in January, 
[02:26:00]  but I still keep  in contact with Donk  via email.  I hear they're  pretty big drinkers  in Australia.  You know,  I don't know  if they're any more so.  You know,  when I had my last  10 days,  I went to the  Great Barrier Reef.  I went to a Club Met  over there.  I went to,  you know,  some Lindemann,  or Great Whitehaven Beach.  It's one of the top  beaches in the world,  and I sort of did  the outdoorsy type  of sailing,  snorkeling type of thing.  I didn't really  go into the local bars, 
[02:26:30]  so I can't verify  that or not,  but I can't imagine  any more so  than anywhere else.  You didn't put a knife  in your mouth  and go after  a Great White  on the reef,  did you?  You know,  it would have had  to be in my mouth  because at that point  I still couldn't  use my hands.  I just threw  about as much clothes  as I could carry  in a backpack  and threw the backpack  over my shoulder.  I was stabbing it  with my teeth,  and then I bit into him  because my hands  were burned.  This guy being  an adventurer.  Hey,  Nick wants to know  what was in that kazoo. 
[02:27:00]  The green kazoo.  Yeah.  I'm told by  some firefighters  it was not morphine.  It was some kind  of drug that heals  up a burn  in your lungs  when you inhale smoke,  and it also acts  as a painkiller  for any kind  of burn syringe  you have.  So after it,  you know,  did whatever  it had to do  to my lungs,  it traveled  down my arms,  and I just felt  it rush right  into my hands,  and it really  kind of soothed  the pain in my hands.  Wow.  And then I had  these ice towels,  these real heavy 
[02:27:30]  ice towels  that they instantly  wrapped on my hands,  and that was as much  relief as the drug was.  Really?  Yeah,  I mean,  when those doctors  arrived,  it wasn't 20 seconds  when I was feeling  pretty good.  I mean,  I never felt like  I was woozy  or had any kind  of medical effects  from it,  but...  Because you're almost  like the I love  you man guy.  You know,  I'm telling you,  my recollection  of that event  is so great.  I mean,  I think that was  all emotion.  I mean,  I actually felt 
[02:28:00]  such a deep bond  that day doesn't  go by when I don't  talk to somebody  from that show,  and it was,  I mean,  I think it's more  emotion than  any kind of drug  that people think,  but you have people  who are saying  that I love you man.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Hey,  I have to ask,  Michael,  did you see any  of those ladies naked?  You know,  Elizabeth,  the very first  day we got  over there,  you know,  there was some talk  and it came  from our beloved  Kimmy,  you know.  We like Kimmy,  she's a fan 
[02:28:30]  of our show  from Long Island,  believe it or not.  You know,  let's go skinny dipping,  you know,  like they did  in the first show.  Yeah.  I guess the taggy tribe  all,  you know,  took the proverbial  dipping  when they got over there,  but,  you know,  we never did.  You know,  we just,  we became more  of a family  from the very first  day over there,  and it was like,  you know,  Elizabeth was like  my sister,  and Roger was like  my dad,  and Nick was like my,  I mean,  I'm telling you,  as sappy as it sounds.  Elizabeth,  she's a piece of ass.  Come on,  Michael.  I'm telling you,  I kept thinking  that the thought  I had about Elizabeth 
[02:29:00]  is my son  was 10 years older  and she ended up  dumping that guy  she's with,  you know,  she is,  she's the whole package.  She's got the brains  and the athleticism  and the moral structure.  She's a tremendous,  tremendous girl.  All right,  we're told  we've got to let you go.  One final question.  What's Jeff going to do  with all the money?  Ah,  you guys,  Jeff's your boy.  Let me tell you,  I got that really quick  funny story to tell you.  After Jeff was just  abusing me  after the first week  and the second week  and the third week,  I had my kids call Jeff 
[02:29:30]  and they said,  Jeff,  why do you hate my dad  so much?  And it was just,  you know,  and then they busted up laughing  and they got a little bit  of pleasure back  out of busting Jeff's shots,  but I had dinner  with him on Saturday night  and Jeff and I  are great friends.  All right,  cool.  Hey,  Michael,  this was a pleasure.  You gave us  some great TV last week.  Oh,  I appreciate it,  man.  It certainly wasn't intentional,  but I definitely had  a great time out there  and I'll never forget it.  Memorable moment.  Anything to look for  tonight on Survivor?  You know,  I'm seeing it for the first time  just like you guys.  I got to tell you,  the whole dynamics of the game 
[02:30:00]  seems like it's going to change  when Jeff and Jerry go at it.  I don't know if they do or not,  but I mean,  that would certainly be something  I'm looking forward to.  We all hate Jerry.  I mean,  that's,  we all hate Jerry.  I mean,  oh,  God.  I don't know.  I'm looking forward to seeing Jeff  tangle with her a little bit.  That should be fun.  Yeah.  All right,  Michael,  we'll let you go.  All right,  sounds good,  guys.  It was great talking to you.  Yeah,  good luck to you,  all right?  All right,  man.  There he goes,  Michael from Survivor 2,  Anthony.  Yeah.  On tonight on CBR.  On CBS.  Eight o'clock tonight. 
[02:30:30]  That was fun.  Were we getting another pizza?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ,  those guys.  How cool is that?  Arkell interviews all over the internet.  Yeah.  And the people from Survivor  listening to it.  That's pretty cool.  All right,  we have one more story to tell today.  Yes.  Yes,  of course,  the depressing cancer kid story.  Twisted,  but it'll give you an insight  to what we're dealing with in Boston.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh,  there's no, 
[02:31:00]  baby.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah,  sure.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W.  We're going to have to lose that sweeper,  Anthony.  Why?  We haven't won any awards lately.  Yeah,  well,  it hasn't been a year,  right?  So we're still award-winning as far as this year goes.  Aren't we up for a TV Guide Award?  God.  Enough with the award shows. 
[02:31:30]  TV Guide Award for a show that's been advertised in the TV Guide longest after the show's been canceled.  It's still on.  Like, I turn on the TV Guide, the guide on the TV, that scrolls.  Saturday, 7.30.  Oh, look, it's XFL game day.  I better run.  I got three minutes to get there.  All right, well, we have one more story to tell about Boston.  We got on this little subject today because of our old GM, Bruce Mittman, the midget.  Bruce, boys, boys. 
[02:32:00]  He was always trying to run block for us in his own inimitable little way, the little midget.  Three feet tall.  Three foot two.  Little Jewish guy.  With a huge suburban.  Yeah.  And he would get complaints from various groups and have to field them for us.  And he would be all PC in front of the person.  But then he'd turn around and, you know, call them shwoogies or faggots. 
[02:32:30]  The faggots have left, boys.  You can resume bashing the faggots.  Well, we finally come to the famous prank.  Yeah, when we did that mayor thing, said the mayor was dead and we were on the verge of getting fired.  We didn't get fired that day.  It went a good week before they actually fired us.  So, in that week, Brucey is trying to do damage control.  Now, it's not working. 
[02:33:00]  The mayor was so pissed off.  But they came up with this idea.  Well, you've got to tell everyone that they hired a PR firm.  Yeah, they hired a PR firm just for this to try to make us look good.  To make us look good and put out the fire so we could keep our jobs and continue rocking Boston.  Now, if you remember, Opie, when we got in trouble,  Brucey and Dada Dave got together and decided that they were going to approach the mayor, Mayor Menino,  and say, look, the same mayor that we just told everyone died in a car accident in April Fool's. 
[02:33:30]  Look, we'll go into Boston.  Put the boys in those stocks, those old stocks where you put your head and your arms through  and your lock in there, and the mayor that we said was dead will throw pies at the boys' face.  And everything will be okay after that.  And then that's fine.  This is the idea that Dada Dave came up with.  So, that's all okie-dokie.  He told the midget, look, I can handle this.  I've got a great way to get us out of this.  Great way to get us out of trouble. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We had news crews camping outside our residence.  Yeah.  And this is going to take care of it.  Just a bunch of our listeners and the mayor throwing pies at our faces.  We're in a stockade.  So, get to this.  Get this.  Before they even check with the mayor or us or anything, Dada Dave goes and orders about  500 pies.  500 big cream pies.  Real pies.  Not whipped cream and tinfoil pie tins.  Real pies.  He wanted us to get hurt.  They were like big lemon meringue pies, apple pies. 
[02:34:30]  The reason why the old pie gag works is because all it is is whipped cream.  Yeah.  But he, no, real pies.  He's going to throw real pies at us.  Five hundred pies he orders.  So, now we get on the air when we find out about this.  Yeah, I got it.  The next day.  I just got to jump in.  Because we didn't really get fired April 1st.  We did the show.  We were on the next day.  April 2nd.  April 2nd.  We start getting wind of this pie scheme.  So, we go off and say, we're not doing this. 
[02:35:00]  We are not going to go in stocks and have pies thrown at us by anybody.  Dave comes running in all pissed off.  You don't tell me what you're going to do.  I'm trying to get damage control.  This is off the air.  He starts yelling at us.  I'm trying to help you guys out and do damage control.  You don't get on the air and say, you're not doing this.  And you're so tame.  Oh, he was screaming.  You don't tell me what you're doing.  Because I said so.  All raging pissed off. 
[02:35:30]  Five hundred pies you are.  It was Davey.  It was Davey Dearest.  Davey Dearest.  Because he was screaming.  You can't hit with these pies.  Because he was screaming in that same cadence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brucey, get the pies.  And you know what, Ant?  I have that audio on at that somewhere.  And to this day, I cannot find it.  It drives me nuts.  Probably the most valuable piece of tape since the Nixon Watergate tape. 
[02:36:00]  Without a doubt.  And I will find it eventually.  Yeah.  But before you move on with the story.  Yeah.  Now, if we back up here.  We told you guys that they hired a PR firm, right?  Mm-hmm.  The midget, Bruce Mittman, who loves the shwuggies so much.  Boys, boys, boys.  Remember what he did to the mayor?  He looked up the mayor's schedule.  Yeah.  Because it was all about damage control and then putting out the fires.  So Bruce Mittman figures if he could get a picture of himself shaking the mayor's hand. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, right.  Because what the PR firm does is they have their...  No, this is a true story.  They have their own, you know, camera crew and stuff.  So they'll go to events, take pictures, and then they'll put it in the paper.  This story was so hot, it was...  He hired basically paparazzi.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, any paper in the New England area would buy this photo of the general manager  of the station that just pulled the most amazing, sickest, ridiculous prank, shaking the mayor's hand.  Uh-huh.  It was gold. 
[02:37:00]  So, freaking the midget finds out the mayor's schedule.  I'm looking up the mayor's schedule, boys.  I will fix this for you.  The fat Dago will be very happy.  So he camps out where the mayor's going to do an appearance or whatever, whatever he was doing.  I forget exactly.  The mayor comes out of his little meeting.  There's Bruce Mittman, runs right up to him.  And there's the paparazzi.  Yeah.  Even though it was a PR firm, but it was a paparazzi guy going...  Snap and pics. 
[02:37:30]  Snapping pictures like crazy.  Yes, it was in all the Boston papers the next day.  Yeah.  Bruce Mittman shaking the hand of the mayor.  Which infuriated the mayor.  Infuriated.  Because the mayor had no idea who the midget was.  He thought he was just shaking a, you know, just a regular schmoe's head.  He thought I was welcoming him to Munchkinland, boys.  Boys.  Boys.  So, that infuriated the mayor as well.  So, now, they finally check.  Dada Dave now calls the mayor's office and says, 
[02:38:00]  I have 500 pies.  I have the boys.  We're going to do this, right?  And the mayor's office just goes,  Are you out of your effing mind?  Do you think we're just going to take our anger with them and what they did and how they hurt the mayor's family  and turn it into some wacky radio stunt prank thing?  No.  Take your pies and shove them up your ass.  That's pretty much what they said.  Yeah.  So, now, 500 pies, ordered. 
[02:38:30]  Opie and Anthony, in trouble.  Damage control, not working.  PR firm.  PR firm, phase two now.  Right.  Okay.  We'll take lemons, make lemonade.  We got 500 pies.  What can we do with 500 pies?  We'll send Opie and Anthony to the Children's Cancer Hospital to deliver the pies to the little dying children.  Like, that's what...  A great photo effing op mother effer.  That's...  Yeah, that's what dying kids want.  Pies. 
[02:39:00]  So, now, we're going to use kids with cancer to try to make it so O&A can keep their goddamn jobs.  Right.  And we were so...  You know, we've got to say it.  We were so shell-shocked, we kind of just went with it.  Dude, we were going wherever they said at that point.  We were just, what?  Yeah.  Okay.  Every hour, they're running promos on the news, updates on where we are, what we're doing, how does the mayor feel, when are they going to get fired?  Are they fired?  Who knows?  This is our lives, and we're just, like, freaking out.  We were like Stepford DJs.  We were just, oh, okay.  All right, whatever.  And we really didn't know what they were doing. 
[02:39:30]  They go, just be at this hospital at this time.  There's going to be a photographer there.  So, we're like, okay.  They didn't tell us about the cancer hospital.  I think, all right, there's a kid with a broken leg.  We'll shove a pie in his arms and we'll leave.  Right.  I don't know.  We go there.  This stuff is done all the time, by the way, by these PRs.  Oh, yeah.  When you see some schlep jock standing there with, you know, hugging little crack babies, you think he wakes up and goes,  well, I think I'm going to go hug some crack babies today. 
[02:40:00]  No, that guy has a story to tell, and he's trying to get himself out of some trouble.  Right.  So, in most cases, I'm sure there's good-hearted souls.  We go to this hospital.  There's the truck.  500 pies in the truck.  And they start bringing them in.  They start bringing in the pies.  We're in the lobby of the hospital.  Now, the people that worked at the cancer hospital, they didn't know the whole story.  They really didn't know who we were at this point.  No.  They really thought that you and I and the radio station was doing a good deed.  Mm-hmm.  That's all they knew at first.  Now, we're standing around waiting for the photographers. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  And they got the pies just loaded all the way up to the ceiling.  Pies.  As far as the photo op goes, it was quite impressive.  So, now they go, okay, let's start bringing the children in.  Right.  Like, all right.  So, like I said, given a broken leg.  At this point, we still think it's just a regular, oh, look at that.  Little Mary just got her tonsils taken out.  How cute.  Hopefully, you can enjoy the lemon meringue.  But you can't eat the crust.  Your throat still hurts. 
[02:41:00]  Because they start wheeling out kids with the clumps of hair coming out.  The baldy heads.  Look, dude, we're not telling the story for a joke.  No, this is what's happening.  So, I'm looking at it open like, oh, my God, these are dying kids.  No, no, no, no, no.  But I got it back.  We did not know at first.  We're still thinking, well, okay, they're in bad shape.  No, I'm looking, and in my head, I'm thinking, oh, my God, they're dying kids.  I'll tell you when I found out.  When? 
[02:41:30]  All of a sudden, even though this was like April 5th or so, okay, all the kids are around the pie stacked up to the ceiling.  We're waiting for, we're still waiting for the photographer.  That was the reason we waited so long.  And all of a sudden, there's little Mary looking just like Cindy Lou Who.  And she's like the leader of the cancer kids.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, they're like little impish little kid.  Sure.  Little cute kid. 
[02:42:00]  Still cute.  Okay.  And you look at her, you're like, oh, this doesn't seem like anything's wrong with her.  And they go, Mary, why don't you sing a song?  You think the rendition of Ziggy doing Silent Night is beautiful?  This girl, like an angel.  Silent Night.  And all the cancer kids joining in, right?  The cancer kid choir?  It was a cancer kid choir.  It was a cancer kid choir. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  So she's like in this voice from heaven.  And I'm really getting into it.  I'm like, wow, that's kind of cool, you know?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, one of the helpers, the nurses, whatever.  Oh, no.  Bends over to me and whispers in my ear, goes, you know, Mary's not going to see Christmas.  No.  Because it was April, all right?  What happened?  I was just talking to her.  She was just singing.  Good kid.  Mary's not going to see Christmas. 
[02:43:00]  So I look at it.  I think at this point, seriously, I turn white as a ghost.  Like, what the F are we doing here?  Yeah, they're there.  And now all the cancer kids are looking at Aunt and I like we're heroes because we brought  all these pies.  We brought a bunch of pies.  And we're like, we're not this nice.  We're not nice.  We're not doing this out of the kindness of our hearts.  We're using these kids.  We were thrown into the situation, did not know.  And they think we're heroes.  And we're like, we are scumbags.  To use kids like this to try to save our necks, the station puts this goddamn thing together. 
[02:43:30]  Now, we're still waiting for the photographer.  Right.  And then the nurses go.  No.  And I don't mean to laugh.  I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable because I don't want to be known as a dick for this  story because this is an insane story.  The nurses go, okay, why don't we get Billy?  So it's like, well, why isn't Billy here with the rest of the kids?  They get wheeled out or walk out or use the crutches and come out with the rest of the kids. 
[02:44:00]  Why don't we get Billy?  It was sort of like, get the gimp, the gimp sleep.  No.  No.  He was the only kid that wasn't there.  We're like, why isn't Billy there?  Suddenly, I hear a low hum down the hallway.  Here comes Billy's electric.  It wasn't even a wheelchair.  I don't know what this was.  It was a rolling platform.  It was like a wheelchair with just a head hooked up to tubes and wires and other devices  to keep little Billy alive. 
[02:44:30]  And the reason he didn't join the kids in the beginning, the cancer kids, is because  basically, you know, he only can muster up enough energy to maybe be awake for five minutes.  He's like your cell phone's NICAD.  You know?  The NICAD!  You don't want to keep it on all the time.  You just want to turn it on when you've got to use it or the battery.  So now they bring, uh, they wheeled little Billy in.  Billy down the hall.  Now it's complete.  The smile on the kid's face, I'm like, holy.  At this point, we're like, so you've got to go through it. 
[02:45:00]  Well, the photographers get there.  And, uh, me and Opie start having a conference.  We're like, this is the wrongest thing.  We have never done anything so wrong.  Because on the radio, when you're talking, yeah, we say stuff that's really off the wall  and wrong.  But then to just be directly involved in something like this, they are using the dying children  to take a photo op with us to try to, in some way, spin it in the paper that we're good guys. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  And should keep our jobs.  Right.  So we just turned around and said, no, this ain't it.  And, uh, we walked.  Walked.  Took our pies, too.  Little kids ain't good.  No.  We left the pies.  And the kids didn't know we walked.  We were like, no, no.  We were like, goodbye, goodbye.  Here you go.  We're presenting these pies.  Yeah.  And that was all fine and well.  But, uh, it was so depressing.  And, uh, and then we were so friggin' pissed at them for putting us in this position at, 
[02:46:00]  uh, management and the, the PR firm that we just went, you know something, you guys do  whatever you want.  We're not doing another thing.  If we get fired, we get fired.  F it.  And they got mad at us because we walked.  Because we walked.  We missed the little photo op to use the dying children to try to save our necks.  That's like just gunfire breaks out.  You pick up little Billy's head and try to block the shots.  That's what it was like.  What?  It was. 
[02:46:30]  Little Billy's still alive, by the way.  He's on the phone.  Billy?  Ooh!  Ooh!  It was horrible.  It was.  And, of course, the story ends.  We did get fired.  Yeah.  And, uh, it was the best thing that ever happened.  And we took it.  Best thing that ever happened.  Boys, boys, I'll try to hire you back, boys.  Why didn't you take pictures with the cancer kids, boys?  Boys, why not take pictures with those little dying craps? 
[02:47:00]  Pussy.  All right, cool.  Let's, uh, let's try to end on an up note.  Too late.  A lot of things went on today.  What did we learn?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Sean from Jersey.  Today, I learned a few things.  Uh, Don Vito knows nothing about the Godfather movies.  Right.  It's a tell-a-bad story.  Get the silent treatment.  The listeners hear the end of a crappy story three times. 
[02:47:30]  And, man sack smells musky.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on, buddy?  What's up?  Joey from NT here.  I learned, uh, I learned two things, guys.  I learned a new term for homeless minority vets.  What?  Shluggy.  Shluggy.  I also learned that, uh, Pyres is a madman.  Oh, ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  He's got his soundboard cranked up. 
[02:48:00]  Nice.  Ah, Dave, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned today that if you shoot yourself in the mouth with a .357, you'll look silly.  You'll look really silly.  Later, Shluggy.  All right.  Coming up next on Eat True Hollywood Stories, the Opie and Anthony story takes a turn for  the worse as the nurse brings out little Billy.  Guys, that, that was as real as a guess.  When they said, let's go get Billy, because everyone is set and prepared, because he only  has enough energy to, oh, remember when the, one kid, one kid who was like, really, I don't 
[02:48:30]  know, really, I can't say it, really disturbing to look at.  I'm sorry.  Disturbing.  We felt bad.  He, he, he's holding a pie, and he takes a finger and smears a bunch of meringue on his  finger and starts shoving it in our face.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And the nurse is like, oh, look how cute.  He's giving me some.  I'm like, I would sooner lick dog crap. 
[02:49:00]  I'm sorry.  I don't know where that kid's been scratching.  Oh.  What?  You're insane.  You're going to do it.  Oh, yeah.  And I saw you just lapping it up like a puppy.  You were horrified.  I don't like kids to begin with.  I don't like when they're eating stuff, and they got crap all over their hands, and they  start shoving their hands in your face.  It's not a good date.  No, that part's kidding.  But you know what I mean. 
[02:49:30]  George, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  How we doing?  Good.  I learned today that you can't add teen to dead-bloated bodies and make it sound appetizing.  No, not at all.  Good job, buddy.  All right, guys.  See you later.  All right.  Bye.  I learned the O&A show was on Puree yesterday.  Puree, yeah.  Puree, I mean, Tad from Fort Chester.  Hopefully, we just went to a chop today.  Angelo from Dubrox.  Today, I learned that the end of yesterday's show was like a flow-be abortion.  Today, Anthony did a hilarious Vince McMahon. 
[02:50:00]  I don't want to ruin it.  Hey, Doreenie.  Today, I learned that horny goat weed comes from China.  I learned today, if you want freedom of speech, you must say everything at least five times.  Get through the delay.  Yeah, it's insane.  Today, I learned that black people can all be called shwoogies.  Today, I learned that Opie makes up childhood stories based on Scooby-Doo cartoons.  All right. 
[02:50:30]  I learned that Indian cooking smells like dead people.  Chris from Manhattan.  I learned that more people named Steve are calling your show,  and that Seagull's favorite food is spoiled green-skinned body from under the pier.  Oscar.  Yo.  Hey.  What's going, guys?  What's up?  Today, I learned that the Tuskegee Airmen and our Secretary of State ain't nothing but a bunch of schmuggies.  Oh, Jesus.  As far as our old GM is concerned.  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah.  I learned if you can't wipe yourself, you should drag yourself on a carpet. 
[02:51:00]  There you go.  Michael taught us that, kind of.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned a new acronym for today.  Retarded Anthony's Pie Extravaganza.  Jesus.  Thank you.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Oh, God.  Ed from Queens.  Today, I learned a few things.  Dead bloated bodies makes good eating for seagulls.  Good eating.  If your parents forget their keys, don't answer the door unless you're fully protected in Kevlar. 
[02:51:30]  Indian food smells like A.  And finally, Little Mary has been dead for about three and a half years.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  That's not true, though.  Three years.  Maybe two and a half.  Yeah, two and a half.  I learned that Anthony wouldn't like a girl without feet.  And I learned that Vince McMahon gets excited.  When he gets excited, he over-modulates.  Did he?  A little bit. 
[02:52:00]  I didn't notice.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned it's okay to smack my wife in the face while having sex.  Well, not every lady likes that.  Well, where's that clip again?  That's a favorite, man.  Thank you, Steve.  Okay.  All right.  Once again, from yesterday.  Here's Erin getting smacked in the face really hard because she likes it.  Norton, make a full fist, wind up and punch her teeth out.  I'm leaving here with rosy cheeks and with Norton. 
[02:52:30]  Jim, come on.  Norton, kick her in the face.  Look at the look, Jim, Jim.  This is so wrong, Jim.  This is so effing wrong.  Jim, wait, wait, wait.  Calm down.  Rick, look out.  I got to see this.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Harder, harder.  Back it up a little bit.  I want to do it short.  Oh, God.  One more.  One more.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  Woo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Can we stab you?  Uncle John.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  I just learned one thing today.  I learned that dead bodies pop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I learned that today, too.  Good job.  Thanks, guys.  See you.  All right.  Can't be around him too long.  Oh, Matt.  Yes.  Shmuggies, how are you?  What's up, Matt?  I learned how to kill a pig today.  Yeah.  You run up the hill.  You run down the hill.  You run up the hill.  You run down the hill. 
[02:53:30]  And then you burn your hands.  No.  Take care, Shmuggies.  That was a little too detailed for my taste, but what the hell.  I want someone to make a concerted effort not to end the goddamn show with a child dying story.  Ha.  Gary.  Very good, Chuck.  Boys, what's going on today?  Hey.  Listen, I learned that you can pick a guy up with a triple twisted nut sack.  Gotta go, guys.  Listen to myself.  Oh, no.  All right, buddy.  That's funny.  Cool. 
[02:54:00]  Steve.  Gotta go listen, man.  Hey, guys.  I learned that dying kids want pie.  I don't think they want pie.  Yeah, want pie.  Great.  Thanks for the pie.  I know.  Thanks, Steve.  See you, guys.  I don't know.  All right.  Pies.  I think we shared too much today.  I am so...  I'm kind of pissed at you.  Me?  For bringing this up.  Because I totally blocked it out.  I was very happy not remembering that whole experience.  Very happy.  Now, every disgusting detail of how little Mary missed Christmas. 
[02:54:30]  I was thinking a little Silent Night in April because she can't sing it for Christmas because she'll be dead.  Because, you know, the horror that was little Billy.  Robokid.  I was proud of ourselves that day.  It took a while, but we finally figured it out.  Finally an excuse to drink tonight.  Let's go to Ed.  Ed, what's going on?  Ed. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  I learned that nobody in your family ever listens to your show because they never call in and back your story.  Later.  That's a good one.  I don't know why they didn't back the dead guy story today.  I'll get him to call tomorrow.  That's a good story.  I'm missing details of that, I'm sure.  Golf balls sound like TIE fighters when they whiz by your head.  Yeah.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Opie's family vacationed at the Bates Motel.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  I'm going to go eat some pie.  All right, bye.  Today I learned that the lady who blew up had a nice breakfast, that Opie's childhood reads like the script for Firestarter.  Michael is working out, so he must have a TV gig.  I learned not to put a broiler pin on the carpet.  That the shwoogies weren't just in Star Wars.  To get a hot nurse to wipe your ass, just burn your hands.  All right, that's all from Ernie up from Jersey, who always helps us out. 
[02:56:00]  What else we got here?  I learned that Merchant Marines end up as drug addicts.  Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head from Westchester.  God damn.  There's a guy with a memory.  That's good.  Jeff, please, drunk German Ed.  Don't kick a black man out on the street in the middle of the night.  I'm running for public office. 
[02:56:30]  I have bullet hole in my head, but not really.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, man, I learned two things today.  I learned that Vistic Man has a co-court fetish, and Opie and Anthony are soon to host the X-Fam pregame show.  There you go.  Take care, guys.  All right.  I learned today that Johnny Knoxville is off the Hokio.  That's a casino from hell.  I learned that Earl is a shadow. 
[02:57:00]  Rich from Glen Oaks.  Boys, boys.  Dan from Old Book.  Jesus.  I learned Opie solved the upstate bungalow fire mystery with Phyllis Diller and the home club johnner.  Hey, that's good, Dan.  Let's go to Francis.  Francis, what's going on?  Hey, today I learned a new use for duct tape and a frying pan. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Ah, come on.  You suck.  No, we're just running out of energy.  Good job.  Someone's saying we were really depressing today.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned the ONA show today was more depressing than Old Yeller.  I know.  Hey.  Later, guys.  Hey, you know, sometimes you got to throw some reality into your radio show.  A little taste.  Ah.  That's how it went down.  Every detail.  Today I learned that if I ever get in trouble, all I need to do to get out of it is take pictures 
[02:58:00]  with faggots, shwoogies, and cancer kids.  Oh.  That's a taco from a store.  Oh.  Okay.  Dunsky.  Yeah.  Cool.  No one picked up on that.  Anthony, as we leave the show today...  We'll leave you.  I ain't saying it. 
[02:58:30]  Everyone else...  Shut up.  What was it?  He said Dunsky.  Ah.  We're Dunsky.  Time for a nap, Ski.  Can we clear the line so we can give out a year's membership to MafiaMob.com?  A prize-ski.  Clear the phone-ski.  We got three?  Three.  All right.  We got three.  Three-ski.  Three one-year memberships to MafiaMob.com, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Whack everybody at MafiaMob.com.  This is what Anthony's into lately. 
[02:59:00]  You're loving it, right?  Oh, we're all, like, playing it a lot.  Let me tell you.  Now I'm getting threats and everything.  I'm going to have to start whacking people.  My crew's going to have to just start whacking people.  You can check it out.  You can check it out for yourself.  MafiaMob.com.  Or as I like to say, Wack-ski.  Wack-ski.  That's why I went silent.  I'm like, I can't believe no one picked up on that.  The hottest new game on the internet, Wack-a-Dun and win $1,000.  That's MafiaMob.com.  We got three.  For three random callers.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[02:59:30]  Son of a bitches.  What?  Pantera from the message board.  Look at the picture.  It's me with a pie and a poor little kid in the hospital.  Yeah, that's great.  You sick son of a bitch.  Hey, we'll see everyone tomorrow for FU Friday.  All right.  All right.  Make sure you call.  All right.  Tomorrow's Friday. 
[03:00:00]  No?  Yeah, it is.  Yes.  If you call the FU line, keep the cursor to a minimum so we can, like, understand what  you're saying.  Okay?  Yes.  That means something to someone out there.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow at 3.  We'll see you tomorrow at 3.  We'll see you tomorrow at 3. </pre>
