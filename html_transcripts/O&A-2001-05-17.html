<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting their previous day's court appearance, which caused them to miss the show. Anthony described a stressful drive in his truck with Massachusetts plates during the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, and his subsequent acquisition of a new car from Bay Ridge Nissan.  The conversation transitioned to *The Sopranos*, with the hosts discussing their views on the show's portrayal of Italian-Americans.  They then revisited the show's history of women voluntarily displaying their breasts on air.  A lengthy segment followed, dominated by a critique of *The Mummy Returns*. Opie vehemently disliked the film, while Anthony and callers offered contrasting opinions, delving into specific scenes, plot points, special effects, and acting performances.  This led to a broader discussion of other films, including *Tomb Raider*, *Final Fantasy*, *Planet of the Apes*, and *Jurassic Park 3*, with the hosts offering their critical assessments.  Listener calls continued throughout this movie discussion, interspersed with sponsor reads, necessitated by Opie's court absence. One particularly disturbing call featured a "Creepy Caller" who threatened to rape listeners' daughters.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming events at the Hard Rock Cafe and various sponsors.


A substantial portion of the show focused on listener calls detailing extensive phone harassment, including threats against listeners and their family members.  Callers recounted various instances of prank calls and disturbing calls, mirroring the "Creepy Caller" segment. The hosts shared their own prank call experiences, such as one where they convinced a nanny's mother that her daughter was working in pornography.  The conversation shifted to O.J. Simpson's alleged advice to Robert Blake about his wife's murder trial,  leading to speculation about Blake's guilt and comparisons to the Simpson case.  The discussion also touched upon gang colors and bandanas.  A recurring figure throughout this segment was a caller known as "Uncle John," strongly suspected by the hosts and callers of being responsible for many of the creepy calls.  This suspicion was bolstered by a reenactment of a creepy caller's phone call attributed to Uncle John. This segment included commercial breaks and sponsor mentions for New York Sports Clubs and Sobe beverages.  Professional wrestler Mick Foley called in towards the end, discussing his career and relationship with Kevin James.


Mick Foley's call continued into the next segment, promoting his book signing in Ridgewood, NJ, and discussing the possibility of a future spanking contest with the hosts.  This segment heavily featured audio clips of Darryl Strawberry's court sentencing, which included an unusual baseball analogy, eliciting mixed reactions from the hosts and callers.  The conversation then moved to the "Monkey Man" attacks in India, with numerous callers sharing their perspectives. The show concluded this segment with a discussion of a Hofstra University student's murder, featuring an interview with the victim's roommate. Several advertisements, including one for New Jersey Cure insurance and another for Stadium Automall, and Stephen Lynch's song "Special Ed," were aired throughout this portion.


The final segment began with a caller recounting a creepy incident involving a bloody ringing phone.  Jim Norton then called in with a vulgar anecdote. A call from the Hard Rock Cafe reported that people were waiting for the hosts' arrival for a T-shirt raffle related to the “Arms Wide Open” foundation. Mention was made of "Stalker Patty" being in town. The show then received calls about a hotel (possibly the Econolodge), including accounts of blood being cleaned up in a room. More caller anecdotes followed, including one about a shared dorm room experience at Hofstra. Anthony shared a disturbing story about a man murdering his two children in a house he previously lived in.  A female caller, Lisa, expressed strong disapproval of the hosts' morbid humor, particularly concerning the double murder story.  A heated exchange ensued, with Lisa accusing the hosts of being callous and disrespectful, and the hosts defending their actions as entertainment.  Lisa ultimately hung up. Another caller then shared their “What I Learned Today” about being accused of disrespecting the dead.  The segment concluded with announcements of the hosts' impending trip to the Hard Rock Cafe, Taz from WWF as a future guest, and a Radiohead listening party with a contest for concert tickets.

[00:07:00]  Here  Have some, Sandy  Now what pisses me off is  You and you both like the mummy  I hated it  I said I enjoyed the movie  I liked going  I liked seeing the mummy  I also pointed out parts of the mummy  That was stupid  That I didn't like  I didn't say this is a great movie  I said I liked it  Parts?  Yeah  Some of the creatures coming to life and stuff  Was kind of cool  I'll give you that  Very cool  But it was one action scene after another  What's wrong with that?  I was getting tired watching 
[00:07:30]  I'm like, oh my god  Will you calm down for a little bit  And give me a little story or something  I can taste and feel?  I'll give you my blockbuster card  You can rent a chocolat whenever you want  I like the action  No, I don't go that  I like the action, Gellman  I don't go that far  As far as movies go  Right  But the movie started with action  And that's all you got  But that's all you got  That's what it's supposed to be  It's the mummy return  Yeah, that's what I said  No, but how about a little story  Something  There's a little feeble story to it  The kid was completely annoying 
[00:08:00]  Hated the kid and the mummy  I said that when I saw it a couple weeks ago  Hated the kid  All of a sudden the girl dies  Goddamn death dedication  The girl there was pretty hot  She was a lot hotter in the first movie  First of all  Second movie she was a little  Really?  She was so much hotter in the first movie  I'm getting picky  I know that  Because of the whole librarian work  She gets stabbed to death, right?  And she's dead  They're all crying  Big death scene  I'm like, alright  That's something a little different  Cool, alright  Right on, man  He's going to move on with his son 
[00:08:30]  Next thing you know  The kid has some  Ancient Egyptian scroll  And says some gibberish  And the lady comes back to life  You didn't see that coming?  I did see it coming  But I was hoping they weren't going to go there  Of course they were going there  That was stupid  And then the rock  The rock with his plastic animated computer head  Computer rock  On a scorpion  That wasn't cool  Computer rock scorpion guy?  You didn't like computer rock scorpion guy?  That was stupid  When he gave the computer rock scorpion guy an eyebrow  An eyebrow?  Oh, that was so stupid  When he grabbed on with all his claws 
[00:09:00]  And ripped that guy apart  Five pieces  Wow  Woo  And computer rock guy  Just going up on the ceiling  And the wall  Stupid  That was cool  The mummies  When they were running sideways on the building  That was kind of cool  I kind of enjoyed that  Army of darkness coming out of the sand  Cool  The little  The little  Little midget skeleton  Little fidget pygmy guys  Cool  That was kind of cool  But it was just the one thing after another  After another  It's like  You have to get away from the reaction a little bit  Just so you can rest in your seat  And go  Wow, that was cool 
[00:09:30]  Okay  No, I like it  It was just  Hit me  Action  What about the air balloon spacecraft thing?  Stupid  And I said it was stupid  And where did they get the black guy from?

No one liked black people in 1930s  Oh my God  Well, there was some very racist attitudes in the 30s here  In the United States  But it was over there in Egypt 
[00:10:00]  North Africa  I mean, come on  Come on  I hated that movie  And halfway through  I felt bad  Because Sammy looks at me  Because maybe my body language  She was singing a lot  Because my arms were falling like that  I'm fidgeting  She goes  Were you making noise?  I was like  I was trying not to  Because, you know  She  I don't  If I asked  I didn't really ask her  Because I was so annoyed  That I really didn't want to talk to anybody  Seriously  I don't think she liked it as much as she thought she was  But was going to as well

Yo, I have to totally agree with Sophie  That movie was so bad  I wanted to walk out  Right when that Chinese guy  Was doing the intro to the movie  Oh  Then when the  When the balloon came at the end 
[00:11:30]  When they're about to be  Sucked up into a hole  Boy, you didn't see that  Coming a million miles away  That's when I was like  Okay, that's it  And how the hell did he  How the hell did he fix that spacecraft?

[00:18:30]  It was like a bunch of scenes  Put together  Did you notice something too?  When they were doing  The action scenes  The fighting  It looked like it was  Speeded up  It was like  This is what I told Anthony  In the back office  About the fighting scenes  And this really frustrated me  About The Mummy Returns  They did it in such  An extreme close up  That it was really hard  To follow the fight scenes  I'll give you that  It was just a mess  On the screen  And you're like  You know what I mean?  Kind of hard to focus  On any one thing  You can really focus  It was just all  Right in your face  The same thing in Gladiator 
[00:19:00]  Good technique  Yeah, that's true  Same technique  Kind of hard to say  Yeah  I don't think it was  As bad in Gladiator  Or like Braveheart  This one  Braveheart wasn't at all  That was pretty cool  Yeah, this one  It just seemed like  They really went for  These really extreme close ups  In these fight scenes  It was dizzy  To my eyes  KC on an instant feedback  Opie says  Mummy 2  Let's see  Pygmies  Did you guys play  Diablo enough?  Okay  I'll give them that one  Han Solo  With the rescue  At the top of the pyramid  Darth Vader  When the boy  With the guy on the train

That's right Opie  That's my little  My little  My little bit  Your gag  Because I always set you up  And say  Hey Anthony  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company  And you go  That's right Opie  You had no one there  So I was trying to, like, bounce off myself to make it feel like I was doing them in a studio on a live show. 
[00:34:30]  That's all.  Setting yourself up.  Come on, and personalize just for her.  And you can get a card just for her.  What if it's a he?  Take two.  A new baby or graduation?  Well, get something, though.  You suck.  I suck.  I'm a loser.  I'm a loser.  You just never learn to read.  Hey, Opie, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  That's right, Opie.  I think my little gag isn't working well. 
[00:35:00]  We love these things.  We've been using them for a long time to have sex with.  And Steve's got to leave in 20 minutes.  And I'm lost.  I'm lost.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Can you bang out five of these in 30 minutes?  Yeah, sure, no problem.  I just don't want to do them with Jim.  That's not true, because he's going to hear this now.  And they're going to help you choose the perfect bear, like the groovy grad bear.  I had it on that one. 
[00:35:30]  Should I just start from here?  Yeah, start from now.  Should I start over again?  Yes.  Because you don't want to keep editing, right?  You could even add the graduate's name and degree.  End it.  Ah, Steve, I'm sorry.  You want to erase all that?  No.  Okay.  No, we don't want to erase names from here.  Oh, it's not that great for him.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Opie.  It's the Vermont...  Hey, Opie.  It's the...  Hey, Opie.  It's the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Well, that's right, Opie.  That's frustrating, because I don't want to just read it.  All right, all right.  What you'll receive is a beautiful bear, handcrafted in Vermont, and a personalized... 
[00:36:00]  And a per...  All right, I'm just going to read it.  I was trying to do something cool, and it's not working.  Send a bear gram, the creative gift alternative gift for...  It's got to learn how to read...  God damn it.  I can't even say what I want, but I want to curse.  I'm so pissed off.  Proofread.  Send a bear gram, the creative gift alternative gift for any...  That don't make sense, you twat. 
[00:36:30]  You're going to be able to, like...  Do you come with that, though?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What?  What, Lee?  What happened?  What did you call me?  Does anyone proofread the...  You don't proofread your copy.  I'm sorry, but do not call me twat.  Oh, boy.  Do not.  Oh, so you didn't...  All the stuff I do for you, don't even go...  Did you hear the bleeped out where he called you a C-word?  Shut up, man.  He called you a see you next Tuesday. 
[00:37:00]  I heard everything.  You forget all the good things, and you remember the one wrong thing.  You don't...  You don't proofread.  You're right.  I did not proofread.  All right.  You do not call me a twat, you schmuck.  That's a schmuck.  I like schmuck.  That doesn't bother me.  Whoa.  She's pissed.  What?  Oh, minute man.  Oh, my God.  Just minute man.  Yeah, we've had sex.  Of course we had.  She just called her a twat again.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:30]  Girls don't like that.  What?  The twat word?  You're just under the C-word, you know?  C's the worst.  Steve and I had eight of these to do, and half the copy on a bunch of them was all wrong.  Keep in mind, that three minutes and 14 seconds is only two of the spots.  Two?  Two?  Yeah.  There was, like, three more.  I just couldn't...  I had other stuff to do, and I couldn't break them down, but it was over and over again.  Over and over again.  Okay, yeah. 
[00:38:00]  I know what you mean.  I'm pumping my head against the wall.  Someone did tell me that I'm not as bad as Anthony, though.  No.  No, you're not as bad as Anthony.  You're not as bad, because once you get into it, you get through one completely.  Well, that mess we just played doesn't really prove it, but...  Yeah.  No, I'm bad.  I curse a lot more.  You curse a lot.  Once he's into it, he'll get through.  Like, the WWF one, he got through completely fine.  That's his slappy technique.  Yeah.  Yeah, he...  I used to do that one fine.  I used a different voice from the WWF. 
[00:38:30]  You did, too, yeah.  You did?  Oh, you did?  What, did you use, like, a deeper voice?  I tried.  WWF.  That's exactly what I tried to do.  That's the voice he used.  By the way, Steve, kudos on your serial killer read.  I never...  I knew about the cancer read, the excitement read, the concert read.  You were doing a spot for, I think, a movie that's going to be on, or a show about serial killers,  and you actually went, a story about a serial killer.  Like, you did your serial killer read.  Is this it?  That's right.  All right, let's hear the beginning of this.  This segment of Opie and Anthony is brought to you by CBS Television. 
[00:39:00]  Tonight on CBS 2, the FBI just caught a serial killer.  Or did they?  One CSI investigator will risk it all to prove them wrong.  The season finale of CSI, tonight at 8 on CBS 2.  They caught it.  They caught it.  So basically, parts of our show are now sponsored by serial killers, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, indirectly.  They sponsor every minute of this show at this point.  Well, the best.  The Ben Show. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, the Ben Show, which is 8 minutes long, will be sponsored soon.  Well, now...  I know.  They're looking into having it sold.  Go to Daryl.  Daryl, what's up?  Yo, yesterday on your WWF thing, dude, you sounded like such a troll.  You were such a wannabe, man.  It was terrible.  It really was.  Did we have that one?  I totally did.  I didn't hear it.  You got pretty yesterday.  Wait, Daryl, you didn't take that seriously, did you?  Oh, dude, it was terrible.  I hope I didn't take it seriously.  I turned it off.  Opie did it right for the first time. 
[00:40:00]  I was just being an idiot.  Dude, it was totally cool.  All right, later, guys.  Bye.  I did it right for the first time.  In the icy fjords of my pants.  You can't get me a jewelry.  You can't find me a jewelry.  No one talks like that.  Gift for giving crisp crumb coatings.  It's not...  It's no big deal.  Let me hear it to you for...  WWF Judgment Day, coming to pay-per-view this Sunday.  Unruly alliances, lunacy and chaos, retribution and despair. 
[00:40:30]  The battle lines have been drawn as the WWF presents WWF Judgment Day, live on pay-per-view  this Sunday, sponsored by RC Cola.  Pride, honor, glory and gold will be on the line as the Undertaker takes on Stone Cold  Steve Austin for the WWF Championship.  The dead man looks to defend his yard, but the Rattlesnake plans to do whatever it takes  to stay on top and keep his WWF power. 
[00:41:00]  You get the point.  All right, all right.  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.  And we have to take a break and we'll get into the real show.  We have to talk about the death at Hofstra.  That whole story is amazing.  O.J. is back in the news.  Daryl Strawberry Audio.  Lots to do.  The biggest hypocrite in the world, O.J. Simpson.  I mean, this is not news to everybody, but he just amazes me every time he says something.  And with his picture on the cover of the post today, I was just thrilled to death. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  As we go to break, Anthony, we've got a pair of tickets to see the Allman Brothers at Jones  Beach on Tuesday, October.  October, excuse me.  August 21st.  Rocktober.

And now the first read for Lisa's client, copy wrong.  I didn't type it.  I was at the sticker stop.  I don't know who typed it.  I screwed up the other one.  That I admit.  I did not do this one.  The sticker stop was yesterday.  I know.  Don't you come in here and check your clients and make sure.  You know, O.P., while I'm out trying to drum up business.  Oh, God, you are merciless. 
[00:46:00]  She's going to flip out on you.  Because now you just take care of talking and still talking to me.  Son of a bitch, hung up on me.  Oh, no, it ain't kind of a bitch.  Oh, right, right.  But this happens all the time.  The listeners are getting bored with it, man.  Well, even with the bad copy.  Sippersteins paint.  And know how cool we are?  Oh, we could have just, like, you know, make believe we didn't see that line.  We knew the loud sticker stop was yesterday.  It's called Editing on the Fly. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  So, yeah, Sippersteins in.  Sippersteins paint.  We love to find folks at Sippersteins.  Yeah.  Lock that studio door.  It could get a little ugly now.  WNW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By O.P. and Anthony.  Irving, New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  Now, this is 1027 WNEW. 
[00:47:00]  212-757-1027 is our phone number as we move on with the festivities today.  Yes.  Anthony, you brought up Creepy Caller.  Creepy Caller.  Creepy Caller.  We were going to talk about this, I guess, Tuesday.  Ran out of time.  There's a guy on Long Island.  They're trying to find him.  So they released the cake.  What he does is he calls up mothers of these girls. 
[00:47:30]  He says, I have your daughter.  And I'm here with my friends and we're going to rape her unless you take your clothes off right now and do what I say and describe yourself and whatnot.  So it's sort of a one-sided phone sex thing that this guy has by threatening that him and his friends are going to rape the woman's daughter.  And he's been getting away with this for a long time, right?  Yeah, like a couple of years.  So one woman taped it and they're hoping that by hearing the voice, it'll get a lead on the case. 
[00:48:00]  But, I don't know, the quality is pretty lousy.  Sounds like one of our Hi, Mom, I'm Gay phone calls to tell you the truth.  But he's been dubbed Creepy Caller.  Take your clothes off.  Pull this thing.  I'm so creepy and I'm a caller.  Boo!  Take your clothes off.  I have your daughter here with my friend Frankenstein and the mommy. 
[00:48:30]  And Abit and Costello.  Because those wouldn't be the scariest of the movies.  That never made sense.  Abit and Costello meet the mommy.  Oh, this is going to be scary.  Oh, you want to hear that?  Yeah, let's hear the tape.  I haven't heard it yet.  I hear it's lousy quality, but just kind of, I don't know.  Don't pay attention to your driving and listen really closely.  Stop kidding.  Shut up.  All right, let's take a listen and see where it goes.  For her.  Are you going for her?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  She's a little bit upset, but it sort of happened. 
[00:49:00]  What?  I don't think it sort of happened.  What happened?  I'm ready to hear it.  I'm on weather.  Well, she's not heard at all, but she's very upset.  Where is she?  I'm going to explain.  Can you continue sticking around with me?  Yes.  So this is the guy's M.O.  He calls up the mothers.  Hi, mom, I'm in porno.  Doesn't it sound like that?  What?  Yeah, get the hi, mom, I'm in porno.  We'll end the segment with that.  Nasty phone pervert.  In the past four years, oh, 72 women have been subjected to the vicious sex host. 
[00:49:30]  The sex hoax host.  In which the mail caller convinces his victim that I have your daughter, or I have your mother, or somebody,  and you're going to be mentally and verbally raped.  That's what he says to them.  I'm going to mentally and verbally rape you over the phone.  So he just set it up and says, well, you know, your daughter's not hurt.  I know where she is, and, you know, we've got to talk.  Right?  Yeah.  Basically, he says he cold calls, or the man cold calls people seeking young women who can intimidate, 
[00:50:00]  he can intimidate into performing sex acts while they're on the phone.  Oh.  Wow.  All right, let's move on with the call.  Is your father next?  No, wait, wait.  What do you mean the phone?  Are you in privacy?  Yes.  Yes.  Do you want to fill it out there?  Yeah.  All right, listen to me very carefully.  We're going to speak to her in about 10 or 15 minutes.  Now, she's not hurt, but I'm afraid that she's sort of been detained. 
[00:50:30]  Very serious, I'm very nervous.  Just sort of bear with me.  How are you?  I'm going to explain.  My name is Paul.  She's being detained for a reason, and this concerns you.  But she's being detained to put you in a position where you must cooperate with me completely.  Now, it's very simple.  If I get complete cooperation from you, you're going to be fine.  But if you give me a hard time and choose not to cooperate, I'm going to hang up the phone, and I'm afraid that she's going to be raped.  Holy ass. 
[00:51:00]  This son of a bitch.  Oh, my God.  I'm completely skeeved out.  We've traced the call.  We've traced the call.  It's Jim Norton.  It's Jim Norton.  We've traced the call.  Isn't that sick?  Wow.  So he does this to these women.  All right.  We'll move on here.  Do you understand that?  You...  Do you understand what I said?  Who are you, though?  Do you understand what I said? 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  Do you have any idea why I've gone through so much trouble?  I don't understand what's going on with him.  Well, I was in prison for a while.  I was in prison for rape.  Now, I'm tired of hurting people, and I don't want to go back.  So what I do now is simply detain someone like...  Just like you in this position, where you must cooperate with me completely.  If you are going to be the victim, you're going to be mentally and verbally raped.  But it's going to stay your daughter, a terrible act of being raped by three men.  And what I need to know is, do you want to help her, or do I just hang up the phone? 
[00:52:00]  Where is my daughter now?  She's in a van right now with two friends of mine.  No, don't say.  She's not touched, and as long as you cooperate, she will be.  But I need to have complete cooperation from you.  Now, you're going to speak with her in 15 minutes.  Now, do you want to help her?  Yes, I want to help her.  All right.  I need you to stand in front of the mirror.  Yes.  Are you in front of the mirror now?  Yes.  Now, how old are you right now?  Have you been right before?  No. 
[00:52:30]  Do you know anyone who has them?  No.  And you don't have to stand up to your daughter for you?  No.  All right.  You're in front of the mirror?  Yes.  I want you to describe yourself to me.  And if I were in a room, if you're looking at you, what would I see right now?  Where is my daughter?  She's there in the head.  She's not harmed.  Now, if you cooperate, she'll be fine.  Now, do as you're called.  Describe yourself to me.  And if I were in a room, if you're looking at you, what would I see right now?  Did you see an adult woman?  Describe yourself. 
[00:53:00]  That's it, right?  Oh.  That's it.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Is that just brutal?  Man.  I think that's come off in the Jerky Boys.  Come off.  What do you look like?  Ah!  Why don't you touch yourself?  Ah!  He's desperate to get his fame back.  This is his new gig.  Oh.  Look, Jerky, I'm going to phone rape you. 
[00:53:30]  With a monkey wrench.  That guy forgot rule number one.  Always steal the cake from the house.  That's the OJ way.  Oh, is that creepy?  It really is.  Like, you totally hear the woman freaking out.  You can feel, yeah, you can totally feel her despair.  God, there's kooks out there, man.  There are just kooks out there.  Man.  Ah, Jeff, what's going on?  What's going on, Owen?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  You know, I got a story about when I was in high school, a teacher there. 
[00:54:00]  He was the band teacher, actually.  So that will give you some idea of what a crack at this guy was.  He would call up.  He would flip through the phone book of the parents of the students, and he would call up  and say, this is Officer Smith.  We have a rumor that somebody's going to be calling and sexually harassing you.  So stay on the line because we're going to trace the call.  And then he'd hang up and call them back and harass them for his off period for, like, 45 to 50 minutes.  And he would do this every day.  And they found out, like, a year later, and he was already out of the school system and out somewhere. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Man.  All right.  Total, total crackhead.  Thanks, Jeff.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  I'm just reading the rest of the story.  It's pretty amazing.  There have been some people that have dialed Star 69 afterwards and then reported it.  They've been traced to phones in East Meadow, Lettertown, and Hempstead.  There you go.  Long Island kook.  Dylan.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  That's you from South Africa. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  I have, like, two stories, actually.  And the first one is this happened to me when I was, like, two years ago, right?  Some guy called me and he said he had my mother locked up and this and this.  And I hung up.  When he said, like, pick your finger and stick it as far up your, like, well, I can't say on the radio.  Like, A, as far as you could, right?  Yeah.  But I hung up then.  But, like, the second story is, like, when I was in the, like, hello?  You needed a free hand.  Hello?  All right.  Click.  Lock.  Go ahead.  All right.  The second story.  I was, like, in, like, fifth grade, fourth grade. 
[00:55:30]  And, like, I went to this.  I got this, my friend's girlfriend's phone number.  And I kept calling her and said, I want to F you to your pee bleeds.  You're so hot.  I want to do this.  I want to do this.  And blah, blah, blah.  And, like, her mom, like, picked up at, like, 10 o'clock and just went off on me.  So I hung up.  And the next day, that chick was, like, so effing paranoid.  Because I, like, put, like...  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  It seems that woman that we just heard, she had her husband call the daughter to make 
[00:56:00]  sure as the call was going on.  And then when the husband said, no, the daughter's fine, that's when she hung up.  Should have kept them on.  Wouldn't it work that if you knew she was okay?  You can go, yeah, okay.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, you play with me.  Because I know the daughter's not there.  Take your schlong, rip it off, and stick it in your...  Hey!  Wouldn't you love to catch someone like that, though?  Oh, without a doubt.  God!  He's out there somewhere, kiddies. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Woo-hoo!  All right.  That's a pretty rough one, though, because usually I'm, like, false for things like this.  Because there are some people that just say, hi, I'm a doctor, and I'm calling.  We're doing examinations by the phone, and we're thinking women in your area have a medical  problem, and it's an easy way to find out.  We're just doing this by phone.  So, if you would lay down now and stick your hand there and feel around, that was always  the one I used.  The guy...  Yeah, yeah.  Like, Rick's looking at me like, how do you know this?  Yeah, but the guy just made that up.  That might work.  The guy played it perfectly, though. 
[00:57:00]  Middle-aged mom on Long Island.  You don't know for sure, you know?  I know.  Middle of the day, daughter's not there.  Nice.  Anthony, this reminds me of our cute little prank call called, hi, mom, I'm in porno.  Well, actually, the mom on, hi, mom, I'm in porno sounds a little more horrified.  Yeah, than the one that thought her daughter might be raped by three men.  Yeah.  Go figure.  It's all for our city that you can't find anywhere.  Whatever.  We'll be back.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play, hi, mom?  Yes, I do.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  I hear you want to play, hi, mom, I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Now, where's your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny?  Yes.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right, I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay, hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice. 
[00:58:00]  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yes?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fall apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but I know I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies. 
[00:58:30]  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  Why?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll...  You, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus, I think she believed you.  I'm thinking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, I have, like, three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me. 
[00:59:00]  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  Um, you don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where, where can I call you?  The same number.  But, Mom?  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God. 
[00:59:30]  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that, you killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really...  Okay.  I am going to kill you.  I love that call.  No.  No, no, no.  No, you don't do that thing there.  Ed.  Yeah.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up?

Yeah, hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  That freak called my wife once.  Come on.  Yeah, I swear to God.  We were living up in Huntington at the time, and the phone rings about 2.30 in the morning,  and right away you think, who's dead, you know?  And she picked up the phone, and this freak started. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, you know, there's a friend of yours.  I found her.  She's drunk.  And he knew my wife's name, called her by name, and he said, oh, your friend, you know,  she's drunk.  I have her on Jericho Terran Pike, and I'm going to rape her.  And at that point, my wife started to freak, so he freaked out and hung out.  But it's real creepy, you know?  It kind of, like, freaks you out.  It's very strange.  You know, you're not sleeping for the rest of the night.  And she went to the cops the next day, and they were like, yeah, we know we've been getting  a bunch of reports, but we can't track this guy down.  He's like a freak, man.  He should just go.  I don't know what he should do. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  Yeah, he's out there somewhere.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Okay.  We have your daughter.  I'm going to ask you to do something right now.

[01:05:30]  Look what I did to you  With cookies  Don't blow now  Don't do the crime  If you can't do the time  Unless you have a dream team  Like me  That's the ONA show  212-757-1027  Yeah  Front page of all the papers  Pretty much  The post gives it a huge picture 
[01:06:00]  It's O.J. Simpson  Talking about the Robert Blake  And his wife  The murder case there  And it says  What nerve  Because now O.J.  Is giving Robert Blake  Advice  This is great  This guy doesn't stop  He loved being loved  Like O.J.  He loved it  He was the most beloved  Sports figure  This guy was  On the commercials  And everyone was like  That O.J. is the nicest guy  And after you kill two people  I think the popularity 
[01:06:30]  Goes down  And  But he still wants that  He still loves being  In the public eye  You think at this point  He just  Thinks he didn't do it  In his own mind  I would  I've read about  People like that  Thinking that  And I really hope  That's not true  I hope that he can  Convince himself  For maybe  23 hours  59 minutes a day  And then all of a sudden  Just go  Oh jeez  I killed him  And then  Oh I'm fine  I never did it  As long as  For a second  He just knows  He friggin did it  You know  But now 
[01:07:00]  With this whole  Robert Blake thing  There's a killer out there  That killed Robert Blake's wife  They really don't have  Any strong suspects  Except for  Robert Blake  Not that I think  He did it  But he was involved  Somehow  That's my opinion  It's kind of  Looking that way  That's what it looks like  Sure  So now OJ's  Stepping in to  Bail him out  I guess  Help him out  Giving him advice  He says  First  Don't take a 
[01:07:30]  Lie detector test  No no  Because that might  Tell if you're lying  See it detects lies  Hence the name  Lie detector  Now the next one  He says  Don't diss  Your dead ex  Like a better advice  OJ  Don't kill your ex  So you won't have to  Worry about dissing her  And don't  Don't watch the TV  So he says  Don't watch it  And then he says  I gotta admit  Oh no 
[01:08:00]  I'm not admitting nothing  Wait a minute  No no no  I gotta admit  I was pretty fascinated  When I first heard it  No ass  It's funny  Cause it's not me  Right  You know now  Watching from the outside  He looks really guilty  As did I  You know he's gotta realize  He can't be talking  About stuff like this  Cause OJ  Everyone still  Thinks and knows  That you killed two people  So he's giving advice  I think he should  I think he should come up 
[01:08:30]  With some of those rhymes  That Johnny Cochran  If it doesn't fit  You must acquit  Some kind of  Robert Blake rhymes  Anything  Yeah  Any rhyme for any crime  Come to OJ  I'll get you off the hook  You don't own a gun  You ain't the one  And he didn't own that gun  Oh he didn't own that gun  No  Okay  If she died of strangulation  I must have been on vacation  I don't know 
[01:09:00]  Maybe that'd help  Helps you out  She was poisoned  And she died  A conviction cannot be applied  And if the bitch drowned  It couldn't be someone brown  That keeps me off the hook  Not William Shatner though  I'm golfing with him  The gun ain't in your hand  You got the wrong man  The OJ crime rhyme  Who did it?  It was Pedro Guerrero  This tool  Now I hear he's gonna be singing 
[01:09:30]  The Beretta thing  What was that clip we saw?  No he  In the paper  He was either reciting  Or singing the Beretta thing  Yeah but he's gonna be on  All Access Hollywood or something?  Extra tonight  Extra  Keep your eye on the sparrow  Don't do the crime  If you can't do the time  Since it says  Reciting the lyrics  Sung by Sammy Davis Jr  OJ Davis Jr  If you got one eye  You can't lie 
[01:10:00]  Simpson tells extra  The only parallels  Between his murder case  And the slaying  Is that Blake's famous  I was famous  I think that's the only comparison  Your wives are dead  And you might have  And you did it  The only difference is  If Blake didn't do it  There's the difference  If he did it's exactly the same  Liz what's going on?  Hey  One of the things that he always used to say 
[01:10:30]  On the show  Beretta  Was  And that's the name of that tune  Yeah remember that?  Yeah  And that's the name of that tune  Shut up you rummy  Bye  Well Liz what do you think?  Huh?  What do you think?  Well I say what?  What's the Robert Blake say?  Didn't I just say it?  And that's the name of that tune  You think he did it?  I know OJ did  And he got away with it  Thank God  And this guy  You know  Did you guys see the  Entertainment Tonight piece 
[01:11:00]  Where they pieced together  All his interviews  They're pretty much  Convicting him right there  I mean  He used to love guns  He had a gun collection  He said he heard voices  And he wanted to kill himself  So I say  The case is pretty much wrapped up  Alright  Thank you  Here's another thing OJ said  I would recommend to everybody  If you ever find yourself  In this position  Like it happens all the time  Every day  So like murdering her  Oh I guess it is happening every day  Yeah but it's like 
[01:11:30]  The people that are doing it  Being a celebrity like that  He says  Do exactly what the Ramseys did  What?  Another couple that killed  That kid  Do exactly what Robert Blake did  Don't take the lie detector test  A lie detector test  At this stage of the investigation  Can only hurt him  It can't help him  Do what the Ramseys did  Choke your little kid  Tim what's up?  Hey guys how you doing?  Good  You know OJ just has to stick his head 
[01:12:00]  Into the new case of the century  You know?  Yeah  Oh yeah  He was in the last one  For the last century  New century  He's got to be on the new one  Yeah  Our newest inductee  Into the murder club  I think he's the first person  First person to be in  Two crimes of the century  In a row  That's a new record  You know damn well  If it does get to the point  Where they find some key evidence  And Robert Blake gets arrested  And then they put the trial on TV  Which it would be  OJ would just be riveted  Oh that's a good one  Don what's going on?  Hey Don 
[01:12:30]  Yeah  What's up?  Hey guys I was just wondering  OJ's going to offer the white Bronco  For a nice drive down L.A. Freeway  He's just trying to get home  And the  How counting to drive  Yeah he'll give him the  Some fake beard too  I could swear that was Robert Blake  On that runaway train the other day  The way it looked with the helicopters over it  That's exactly  Wait a minute  I did not think of that  A two two train  This is a new twist on an old game  Nice  NBA playoffs 
[01:13:00]  You going on  Perfect timing  Just like  Yeah  And the OJ thing went down  Sal what's up?  Hey how you doing O&A?  Hey  What's up?  Listen I think OJ's going to give lessons  To Robert Blake  How to make that stupid face  In the courtroom  When he's trying on the glove  What a tool  Yeah you got to make the face like  Oh yeah  Oh it's not fitting  It's not me  Remember that  He's pulling that glove on  It's not fitting  You know what  No one ever talked about that glove in a way 
[01:13:30]  Like if you were going to murder someone  Okay  And you were going to put gloves on  Would you find a pair of gloves  That fit you perfectly  Or would you get something  That would be a little uncomfortable  But would still do the trick  Yeah and  You're absolutely right  But then the shoe thing too  The Bruno Manda shoes  I mean those are  Totally traced right back to him  Right  Oh jeez  How about his blood  I don't know how Robert Blake did it  He didn't leave any blood of him  On the crime scene  His car didn't have blood all over it 
[01:14:00]  His house didn't have blood in it  But everyone bought the glove thing  With Johnny Conkren  Yeah  Just because the glove didn't fit  That doesn't mean he didn't squeeze it on  No everybody didn't buy it  The effing jury bought it  Right you're right  Twelve people bought the fact that  The glove didn't fit  Everyone else knew  Guilty  Because criminals got to make sure  Their clothes fit perfectly  Yes  Of course  Was Robert Blake seen  Running into his house  In a black jumpsuit  In the black wool cap  With the limo guy  Right outside  OJ 
[01:14:30]  OJ  I'm here to pick you up  To go to the airport  OJ  OJ  OJ  OJ  I just saw you  Running the house  I saw you  Across the driveway  You were dressed in a black  Sweatsuit  With a hood  Or something  I don't know why  You came out  From the side of the house  Hello  OJ  Hello  Hi little guy  It's the OJ 
[01:15:00]  On the intercom  I was just sleeping  It's Robert Blake there  We was at the Mezzaluna  Or the Vitello  Why do they always go to the Daigo joint  Before you get killed  Don't go to the L.A. Daigo joint  Todd what's going on  Get some reason  What's up  Hey  Yeah man  I was thinking  Why can't OJ just go away  You know  If I was OJ  I'd go to Ireland 
[01:15:30]  And mess with the white women  Over there  You know what I mean  Todd it doesn't make your day  When you buy the paper  In the morning  You see OJ's big mug  On the front page  I love it  He sucks  He just pisses me off  You remember when all the black guys  Were all in at him though  Like you know  Like two years ago  When he got away with murder  Yeah  It's like he didn't do anything  For the black community  In the first place  You know  And now he sure isn't either  He's living in Florida  He's got his nice white trophy girlfriend  Yeah  Gilbert Dobbs did more  For the black community  Than him  You know  Very good  Such a lame-o 
[01:16:00]  I can't stand it  Why can't he die of AIDS  Or something  Whoa  Hey  Hey  Wow look at that  All right Todd  Thank you  All right have a good one  All right  That is weird  The Italian restaurant connection  There's something there  Who knew  He started out good  But now  He's on the streets  Doing bad things  Did you know that's OJ Simpson?  No  He don't look like him  What do you want to be  When you grow up?  A football player  Do you want to be like OJ Simpson? 
[01:16:30]  No  How come?  Because  I don't want to kill people  I don't want to kill my girlfriend  Cause I don't want to kill my girlfriend  I asked the little black kid that  Kid probably wasn't even born when he all went down  Cause I don't want to kill my girlfriend  Unless that bitch done piss me off  I would smack that bitch down  Oh my god 
[01:17:00]  That's a great clip  Keith what's going on?  Hey  And you know how you said  Robert Blake goes to trial  About penalties and everything?  Yeah  Just imagine OJ Simpson on Extra  As the special  Celebrity murdered wife correspondent  That they would have  Wouldn't you do that?  Give this guy a job for god's sake  I don't care about  That you would be given a murder or money  Yeah I really don't care about that  Think of the entertainment for everybody  Think of the XFL  Would have hired him  Down on the sidelines  To call the game  That would have gotten viewers 
[01:17:30]  That's where the XFL went horribly wrong  Get him  Like that new black reporter  They got on MTV  Oh my god  Ben what's that guy's name?  The black reporter on MTV  That does all the black news  He got famous  Because of the puffy trial  Yeah boy  Here be the news  Mother ever  The ladies in the puffy trial  He's got the bandana  Sway  Yo it's Sway  Mother ever  What up  Here be the news  I mean I can understand  You know  You want a baby appeal 
[01:18:00]  To some of your viewers  But that's really  Taking it to the limit  And I'll be wearing  The neutral bandana  On my head  I don't like the red  Or the blue  I got a yellow one  Let me ask you something  About the bandanas  Anthony  They're selling the bandanas  All over the city now  Yeah well  Some are coming  At the newsstands  Yeah  I want to know  What color is safe  Because I'm thinking  Of getting a bandana  Well  It's obvious  Open for you  Any color  I don't think anyone's  Mistaking you  For a blood  No  I've read the articles  No  They don't 
[01:18:30]  They don't like  What other people  Are wearing  Their colors  So  It's the gay gang  So blue's out  And red's out  Right  Yeah  Blue and red  Were like the  Dangerous colors  But now  I just heard  That the bloods  And the crypts  Are now dressing  In suits  To get into  More white collar crime  Like identity stealing  Credit card theft  So you can't even  Tell anymore  It's like

[01:20:00]  Maybe OJ  And either of them  Did it  Maybe OJ did it  Just to throw  Everyone off  Maybe  Alright Mel  See ya  Bye  I know what killed  My wife  The bull  Lizzie Skinner  Grabbed her ankle  Wouldn't let her go  Me kicking her  Knuckles as she  Clinged for life  On the edge  Of the bull coping  Really didn't help  Matt as much  Wasn't me  Scott what's up  Hey guys how you doing  Pretty good  OJ I teach in  In a very tough area  You can't wear  Solid colors

[01:39:30]  No I have a much more  Urgent matter at hand  The first  This is my  I've been going over  A strategy first  It's the  Kiss up  And then plead strategy  Kiss up and plead  So first I start by saying  And I don't  I never kiss up  Unless it's the truth  This is the truth  But it's also  Blatant sucking up  And that is  You want to get naked for it  I swear  I have never gotten  So much feedback  Than I did  After doing the show  Last week  Oh cool  All of it positive 
[01:40:00]  You killed for us though  I mean that was  Some fun stuff  That was a good time  We would love to have you  Back in the studio live  Well I tell you what  I wasn't counting on  Coming back  Until I had something else  To blatantly plug  Like a Halloween book  For kids  But  Yeah  It sure is  You know  Desperate times  That need desperate  To declare  Desperate measures  Whatever that saying is  So look  I want you guys to know  The book  Did really well  It actually is going to  Debut at number one  On the New York Times  Holy F  Congratulations 
[01:40:30]  This is nice  Right  Second book for you  It's quite an accomplishment  But I'll tell you what  It was a dog fight  You know what it came down to  Who  Me and George Carlin  Like real neck and neck  Okay  Let me tell you something  And you know what  I have a feeling  George Carlin will be on our show  In the near future  Right  I'm reading your book  And his at the same time  Yeah what do you think  Yours is a better book  You read two books  At the same time  I got the  Yeah  Let me tell you  I read the George Carlin book  When I'm taking my craps 
[01:41:00]  In the morning  And I read the McFoley book  On the train  I'd be like  What  McFoley was on Johnny Carson  I couldn't even  I wouldn't even be able to  Nope  I get all confused  George Carlin  I get confused  Well George has got  That mainstream publicity  You know  But let's face it  I mean I hear his book  Is really good for fans  But he's basically  Just doing his stand up act  On paper  Yeah it's just quick observations  Anthony  So when you're  You know  You're taking care of business  In the morning  And you've got like  Five minutes to kill  In the bathroom  Okay  Couple observations  You put the book down  And you go downstairs  For breakfast 
[01:41:30]  You wouldn't get confused  That George Carlin  Was in Helen's cell  Or something  No because  I just want to make sure  Because I get confused  Not like Nick just said  It's his stand up routine  On paper  Which I've always found weird  When the comedians do that  And I'm going to give  George props  Where he deserves it  The single best line  I've ever read  And I know it's part  Of his stand up bag  And this is like  From a book  Two years ago  It's where he said  And I've been contemplating  This ever since  He said  What is the plural  For hell of a guy  And then you can literally  Spend hours  Trying to figure that out 
[01:42:00]  And there is no  There is no correct answer  But I'll tell you  The difference  Between me and George Carlin  Yeah  Is that George has been  And he's been on  The Tonight Show  Right  I mean he's been on  Letterman  All the places  That I get rejected  From regularly  And the difference  Between me and him  And calling  The Opie and Anthony Show  He won't call O&A  No  He's blatantly  Plugged  His last New York  Area book signing  Which I'm about to do  Oh  Oh  You see  I figure  You know  It could be the difference  Between that number one slot 
[01:42:30]  And number two  For next week  Yeah  Yeah  So I'd like all the people  There to know  That the last  And you guys should play it up  Like it's like  A Beatles last concert  Or something  Right  Once they leave America  For the last time  They're not coming back  Right  So there will be no more  New York area book signings  After this Friday  In Ridgewood, New Jersey  A place called Bookends  From 6 to 8  That's tomorrow  That's tomorrow  And Ridge  Ridgewood  Ridgewood  And you know what I spent  When I was at Ridgewood  A year and a half ago  For Have a Nice Day 
[01:43:00]  I could not take my eyes off  And don't get the wrong feeling here  I could not take my eyes off  The Donny Osmond  Book signing poster  The reason being  It was like  I was just in awe  This is the same guy  That wrote  Go away little girl  Yeah  One bad apple  Can't spoil the whole bunch  Baby  And it was like  An hour and a half  Into it  And I said  For like the third time  Wow  You've really had  Donny Osmond here  And the guy was like  You know  You have about  Three times as many people  As he does  And then I could  Start breathing  A little bit easier  That's very cool  So look 
[01:43:30]  If you guys would  Hit that just a little bit  You know  George Carlin  Doesn't need the cash  As bad as I do  All right  And what's going on  With the wrestling thing  Well  I don't know  I still  The other day  He's like  Yeah okay  I'll show off  Who cares  Whether I'll show off  You know  I watched the other day  And Undertaker  His wife  Had the  The car accident  On the show  Yeah  And so now  I'm hoping to tune in  Tonight  And find out  That they were just kidding  I hate to let them think 
[01:44:00]  That not even  That she had a real accident  But that we were trying  To make the audience  Think that she had  A real accident  Right  You know  That's like  That's a sign  I don't know  I just  Didn't  Didn't go  Hardly along with that  Huh  Look at that  Yeah  Coming out  The tension in the ranks  Coming out  Against Vince McMahon's  Ideas  You just  Make sure  You get there  And show up  And do what I say  Or you're fine  You know  One time  Vince I swear  He like 
[01:44:30]  Would have done  A Yiddish man  Proud  Vince said  That he's in the ring  And he goes  Now Mick  As a person  You're not bad  But as a commissioner  You  Son  He was going to  CK sounds  About 11 seconds  I think  You're great  He's the commissioner  I love the comedy  Man  Alright  You know  It's gotten away  From the comedy  I don't know why  Yeah  I don't know why  Either  I think that's pretty good  I like when Triple H  Does some of that comedy  We did enough 
[01:45:00]  We did enough comedy  Mick  In the XFL  Hey  We got Vince  On the line  Mick  You have a line  Yeah  You're fired  You son  Hey you know what  Before I go  Let me tell you  I was tuning in the other day  When you had Timmy on  Yeah  That is Timmy from Survivor  Right  Right  The weird thing is  You know  She kept talking about  Kevin James  Right  Yeah 
[01:45:30]  You know  I went to high school  With Kevin James  Yeah we know  And college  So what I'm going to do  Is I'm going to completely  Blow this guy's career  I'm going to bring in  A picture of me and him  Standing together  On the wrestling team  And I'm going to publicly  Say I don't care  If he knows or not  I swear to you  He took my whole  You know  Cuddly fat guy  Teddy bear image  Off of me  And is now making  Millions off  I think this guy  In high school  Was ripped  Oh really  He had a body  Yeah  He had the big  80's hairdo going 
[01:46:00]  Did he  Is he part in the middle  He had it feathered back  He's hitting the tricep pose  Right next to me  And I look pretty much the same  Except without as big a gut  And he's taken that image  That I think I created  And cultivated  In WWF  And has  Just run away with it  You people in this business  You know  Thank God we're on radio  Where no one ever says  Anything like that  Okay  Well Kimmy was on the show 
[01:46:30]  A couple days ago  And basically admitted  That she slept with Kevin James  Really  Yeah  For a while there  We thought it might have been  Mick Foley  We had to protect you Mick  Ah thank you  I appreciate it  No you know what  I'm trying to find out  Because I knew a couple  Cappenburgs  And that's not really  A common name  Uh oh  Yeah it was  I guess you guys  Were a couple years  Older than she was  Yeah yeah  She had an older brother  Troy right  Troy  Yeah I guess so  Yeah that'd be it  And a sister named Terry  So  And you didn't bang  Any of them  Troy  No I didn't do  A lot of banging  For the first 23 years  Of my life 
[01:47:00]  No huh  Wow  Not really  It wasn't by  It wasn't by choice though  And then you end up  With like a model  I don't know  How did that happen  I wasn't even making money  At that time  I don't know what went wrong  Wow  I don't know  Is she retarded  No  Okay well that's a viable question  I'm just  What do you think  I go around looking for like  Models in recent car accidents  Not a bad idea  He ends up marrying a model  Before he was famous  Yeah  I mean that's just  After years of not getting anything 
[01:47:30]  I don't mean to sound  Callish and crude about this  But I'm like looking for  You know  Like these last two books  Have done really well  But people are like  What are you going to do now  You know you can't write  Another memoir  And so taking into account  How well Mitch Albom did  With Tuesdays with Maury  I'm now interviewing  Charismatic dying old men  For a Mondays with Mickey  That I'm working on  Mondays with Mickey  Mondays, Wednesdays  And alternating Fridays  With Mickey  So you know 
[01:48:00]  Man we're going to have to  Find you another career  I'm thinking  I don't know  I don't know  You have too much time  On your hands  I know when I'm listening  To O&A  I was in the traffic jam  Hey the next time  We'll have Kimmy  Get naked for you  Does she do that?  Yeah she'll do it  You know what I couldn't believe  Is that you guys said  You had Triple H  Spanking a girl  This is the kind of power  You guys wield  Remember I was in there  I said how come  I don't get to spank a girl  It was like  Three seconds later  And there was a girl in there  I know isn't that sick  And it was like  She didn't want to be spanked 
[01:48:30]  She was just doing  What she was told to do  Like it started the job  It's like white slavery in here  We have these girls  It's amazing  And just in case  Your wife's listening today  You passed on the spanking  Of course  I did pass on the spanking  Yes you did  Yeah I wouldn't do  I wouldn't pass on it  A second time though  Not twice  No but Kimmy gets naked for us  And we don't even have to pay her  It's pretty cool  Really?

[01:50:00]  And not just to plug  The book thing  At least he's honest  I know  Absolutely  At least he's fun though  To talk to  You know  It's not like somebody  That just plugs  You want to do a little  Daryl Strawberry  Before we  Are we running late  I don't even know  Where we are  Faberol  Doing okay right  Poor Daryl  Man I'm usually like  A real callous bastard  Especially when it's  Your own fault  You know  You see people that are  Really successful  And they F it up  With drugs and stuff  And you just look  And go  What a tool  What a jackass 
[01:50:30]  But then you see Daryl  Just time and time again  In the courtroom  Again  And he's F'd up again  He's on the drugs again  And you're just  I'm just kind of  Watching today  Just going  Jesus  Poor bastard  You know  What's the problem  How much help  Another one  That Robert Downey Jr  Which I don't feel  Is bad for  I feel more sorry  For Daryl  I mean  He admitted  He's suffering  From depression  Yeah  He's got the cancer  And then on top of that  He's trying to kick  The drug thing  That's a  Yeah  It's just  God damn  What is it going to take  Like you  What's going on 
[01:51:00]  In your life  That it takes  This much work  To get you to look  At where you were  And where you are now  And say  Alright  What's the common  Denominator here  That F'd me up  From point A to point B  And it's drugs  You know  But you just  Can't stop doing them  Feels good  I was just like  Disgusted with the judge  The judge gave him  A phoenix house  Rehab  Right  Instead of  He could have been in prison  Yeah a lot of people  Were convinced he was  Going back to jail 
[01:51:30]  But she went the other way  But in a very  Spontaneous  Very loose speech  The judge gave  It felt like she was  Reading a teleprompter  Yeah you want to go  To the audio  Yeah let's listen  Yes your honor  I would like to say  This case is not about  Daryl Charlotte  A baseball star  This case is about  A person that's very sick  Like O.E.G  But I've been very sick  For a very long time  And needs a great deal  Of help  It's been a tremendous 
[01:52:00]  Amount of pressure  For me to get the help  And I just think  With the right decision  And the right place  That I'm placed  That I can get the help  That I need  But once and for all  So I can stay up  With drugs  Thank you  You know with the help  Of God  That I believe in  And will relieve me  From your abuse  And I just  I just thank God  That I'm alive today  And I'm here  To be in front of you  And deal with this situation 
[01:52:30]  Whoa  Oh wow  Poor Daryl  Really bad  He can't get off the dope  Can't get off the dope  Let's grab the other one  The sentencing I guess  Right  Yeah the judge  Chimes in  She sounds like  She's making a baseball analogy  While  Like Daryl needs to hear  A baseball analogy  Yeah enough baseball analogies  I'm sure he's heard  Every baseball analogy  There is  And you know  If maybe the baseball analogy  Is coming from  Joe Torre or something  That's fine 
[01:53:00]  This judge  You can hear it in a voice  She knows nothing of the game  But it's like  I need a baseball analogy  And she's reading  It just sounds really  Uncomfortable  And awkward  And bad  And forced  You want to hear it  Let's hear it  This is Strawberry  Getting sentenced  A few hours ago  The court finds  Mr. Strawberry  Is currently amenable  To treatment  And he needs treatment  The preponderance of evidence  Suggest  That the defendant  Would be better  Served 
[01:53:30]  At the present time  In Phoenix House  As opposed to  Florida State Prison  This court recognizes  If we were to analogize  To a ninth inning baseball game  That you are  At that  In the bottom of the ninth  With two strikes against you  You have proven  That you are a winner  On the field  Now you must prove  That you are a winner  Off the field  At ninth inning baseball game 
[01:54:00]  You are at the bottom  Of the ninth  With two strikes  Against you  Well  Who's on the mound  Who's on the mound  How many outs  Right  And Darrell  And Darrell  Clutch hitter  You know what I mean  He's been in that situation  Before I made it pay off  Are the bases loaded  You know  Are the runners gonna go  Maybe it's a blowout  It's 12-0  Oh no  It doesn't even matter  Right  It doesn't matter  Give me some details  Maggie I'm a little upset 
[01:54:30]  At the judge  Talking about baseball  We don't talk about  Traditional matters  I don't think  She should be  Talking about baseball  She didn't even know  What the count was  The sun came right today  It's two strikes  But they have any balls  On them  The size of eight balls  Play ball  It's a regular season  Out of all city  And headed for home  It's a brown game  Imagine if  If there was  An organ playing  In the courtroom  Go back to that 
[01:55:00]  Go back to the clip  Ladies  Yeah  Where's Jay Moore  When we need him  He does a great  Ladies and gentlemen  Darrell Strawberry  That's pretty good  You just gotta sound  Like you're dying  I can't do the charge  And the thing  At the same time  Damn machines  That'd be good  That's funny  Rumor has it  Bob Murphy  Was in the courtroom  Yes  And two strikes  On Darrell Strawberry 
[01:55:30]  As the judge has said  And the bitch  It's high  It's long  I think it's  It's out of here  It's a home run  Oh  Oh you caught it  Oh wait a minute  Okay  Then Darrell goes to jail  What happened  Wait a minute  What position  Does the judge play  Give me a god damn drink  Two strikes  On Darrell Strawberry  It's the ninth inning  As per the judge  In the bitch  It's fouled  There's a happy young fan  Oh wait a minute 
[01:56:00]  I'm at the court now  Kurt what's going on  Two strikes against him  I'm at ten strikes against him  What kind of baseball is that  Yeah  Yeah  Much more than two strikes  Against Darrell  Two strikes  He's had about  Yeah you're right  About ten strikes  Listen to her awkward delivery though  If we can play it again  It's just horrible  She sounds so  Like you can tell  She knows nothing  She knows nothing of the game  Oh Michael  You bastard 
[01:56:30]  Go ahead Michael  Hey  Hey  Hey  I think the judge  Should have sentenced Darrell  Back to play  For the Mets  Fuck  I hate you  I like Darrell Strawberry  Tony  I know he's in the tomb  But he's got the ass cancer  I understand ass cancer  Tony  I feel for him  Get him his dope  I don't care what it takes  Tommy what's going on  What's going on guys 
[01:57:00]  Hey  I hope he's a kid  And he's feeling bad for this day  Nah I kind of feel bad  Nah I feel bad for him  At one point you just reached  Such an all time low  Huh  Tom  Your phone's crapping out  But I feel bad  How many chances  Are they going to give him  What chance  You know the guy's in hell  You're going to put him in hell  In the friggin  The Phoenix house  Or in prison  I can tell you one thing  He hasn't done anything to me  And it seems like  The only person he's effing up  Is himself  You know that guy 
[01:57:30]  Likes smoking a little crack  Likes a few of the hookers  Who doesn't  But it's more than  On top of that  You know  He's got the cancer pretty bad  He's getting the chemo  He's got the  You know  The depression  I'm going to recommend him  To Dr. Kennedy  Dr. Kennedy will fix him  You want to hear the judge again  The awkward baseball analogy  Yeah  Yeah let's hear this  This court finds  Mr. Strawberry  Is currently amenable  To treatment  And he needs treatment  Yes  The preponderance of evidence 
[01:58:00]  Suggests that the defendant  Would be better served  At the present time  In Phoenix house  As opposed to  Florida State prison  This court recognizes  If we were to analogize  To a ninth inning  Baseball game  Oh what  That you are  At that  In the bottom of the ninth  With two strikes against you  You have proven  That you are a winner  On the field  Now you must prove  That you are a winner  Off the field  You're in the locker room 
[01:58:30]  And you've dropped the soap  This is your last chance  How many balls does he have?  I know  He didn't give the count on ball  Are the runners running  On the pitch?  I mean  Who's pitching?  Maybe he's throwing wild  Yeah  Come on  Give us some more info  Is it like late September?  Is it April?  Are we in a pennant race?  Order of the clothes  No  If we were to analogize 
[01:59:00]  You're with a crack whore  She's got the aid  But you gotta get laid  TJ  Hey  How's it going?  Good  Do you really think  Rehab's even gonna help Darrell?  I still think he's not gonna help him one day  No  TJ I'll go on record  The rehab's not gonna help  Jail's not gonna help  He's gonna end up dying from this  Yeah you know  He's still gonna have the cancer  He's still gonna be depressed  Not if he goes to Dr. Kennedy  Bacala  Give him the number  Help him

[02:12:30]  Yeah  The fighting in the movie  Was maybe  A total of ten minutes  Yeah  It just  They don't hold up  But at the time  It was the best thing out there  God damn  This is a great movie  That's why  It's great  When you see  Some of these classics  Being remade  Yeah  Like for example  The obvious one  Planet of the Apes  Yeah  Updating that  I know  Update these things  That I can't wait to see  Planet of the Apes  Dying to see that one  Should be good  I hope  You think it's going to be good  I sure hope so

[02:14:30]  It should be used to wipe your crapper  That bad  Well I just hate when comedians  They've all done it  Just like Mick Foley said a little while ago  He nailed it  When comedians  They put these books out  And it's their stand up back  Yeah  You know  How could I  How could I possibly translate well to a book  I don't know  But wait  My third book  Before you turn that around  Okay  I'm just trying to prove to you  Monkey Man does exist  My third book  And I highly recommend it  Yeah  And we're trying to get these guys on the show 
[02:15:00]  I don't even know if they're coming in  The Motley Crue  Autobiography  Yes  Oh  That's a good read  Now those guys knew how to party  That's a good read  We're trying to get a couple of the guys in  To discuss the book  But I'm reading that on the way home  Right there in the 80s  Doing their coke and heroin and drinking  Nice  Nice  Really good  So that's  Someone asked  So yeah  Those are the books I'm reading  Three at a time  Opie  If I could turn this around 
[02:15:30]  Look at a whole column on drugs  Here  Dedicated  To Monkey Man  Now there's a picture of  One of Monkey Man's victims  Monkey Monster's drama goes on  Four  Hurt  In last  Latest attack  Police predict more attacks  Monkey Man attacks  Cause hysteria  Second death reported  Six more deaths  Panic  In suburban New Delhi  There is 
[02:16:00]  A monkey man  On the loose  In India  The monkey man  Of Ghazibad  Is now in Delhi  And he continues  As a packing spree  Now they're worried 
[02:16:30]  About the bacteria  From Monkey Man's saliva  Getting into their blood  You've been had my friend  No there's Monkey Man  Monkey Man's running around  In India  Doing what  To who  Biting people  And eating them  And eating them  See in India  Let me give you a little  Info on India  There's so many people  In India  And they're so poor  That they have a bunch  Of these little old  Falling down buildings  But they don't have enough room 
[02:17:00]  And it's very hot  And sweltering  So a lot of people  Sleep on the roofs  Of their buildings  Over in India  Common practice  You go up to the roof  Yeah there's no air conditioning  They got  They crap in their rooms  They throw it out the window  They're like monkey men  So they sleep on the roofs  All of a sudden  Here comes Monkey Man  He's been described as  He has the body of a man  Opie  But the face  And head of a monkey  And claws  And he grabs people  And starts eating them  As they sleep 
[02:17:30]  And then everybody yells  Oh my god  It's Monkey Man  And then they chase him away  Sometimes  Sometimes he stays  And nibbles on people  A little more  And then they jump off the roof  Yeah  Now here's  Here's the deal  If Monkey Man was here  In America  We'd be like  Yeah okay  Monkey Man  She like opiates  Yeah Monkey Man  Whatever  In India  They believe so much 
[02:18:00]  That Monkey Man  That when people now yell  Oh Monkey Man  Monkey Man  People jump off the roofs  They've had two deaths  Of people that have fallen  A pregnant woman  Was running so scared  She ran flat into a wall  And fell down the stairs  And killed herself  Because she thought  Monkey Man was chasing her  They yelled Monkey Man  It's coming from people  That think cows are sacred  Right  Another guy  He's sleeping on the roof  Monkey Man goes to attack him  He gets up  He hears  Monkey Man  Monkey Man  And runs right off the roof 
[02:18:30]  Falls to his death  And other people  Have been killed  By Monkey Man  Himself  Now how do you  Explain Monkey Man  Well  I'm reading the article  That you gave me  In front of me  That I think  Is completely fake  But okay  I'll go with it  It's fake  It's all over the news  The Hindu Times  Says Monkey Man  Is an alien  Or a robot  It's not a robot  That's ridiculous  The mystery creature 
[02:19:00]  Spread terror  From 8pm on Monday  To 7am on Tuesday  And its attacks  Became more furious  Terrorized people  Kept calling for police's help  But the Monkey Man  Outwitted the cops  And struck at willoping  Tension  Was writ large  On the faces  Of the residents  Of Selenpur  Karjijarkaz  And Masarashi  Gala Malpar  And the Krishna Nagar  You know maybe  If they  Maybe if they ate beef
