<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a bewildered Larry King introduction before diving into a discussion of the extreme US heatwave, contrasting it with the significantly cooler temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and Canada.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, joked about a "bubblegum pink" heatwave on the weather map and the proliferation of thermometer photos on Facebook.  Callers from the Pacific Northwest (reporting 56 degrees) and Canada (providing a temperature in Celsius, leading to a metric system debate) further fueled the weather discussion, which segued into a conversation about New York City's rolling blackouts due to high AC usage and perceived inequities in city services. This sparked a humorous suggestion to conserve energy by shutting down various SiriusXM channels, including Cinemagic, 40s on 4, and several international channels. A Sirius XM Canada representative, Mike, then called in to explain Canadian broadcasting regulations regarding language quotas and mandatory Canadian/Aboriginal content, resulting in a discussion about French pop music.  A sample of a French-language channel was played.

The show then took a sexually charged turn with Opie's theory that perfume and cologne masked natural scents, leading to high divorce rates. This launched a discussion about the abundance of female genital hygiene products versus the scarcity of male equivalents, incorporating several sexually explicit jokes and references to cock rings and vaginal care products.  The segment concluded with a caller's perfume anecdote and the hosts' commentary on images from a Spring Break Bikini Contest, featuring explicit descriptions of the women.

The next segment focused on online pornography and parenthood.  The hosts discussed a Twitter account featuring revealing photos of women's buttocks, favorably comparing it to hardcore pornography and making comments about celebrities like Selena Gomez and Britney Spears.  Guest Louis C.K. then joined, sharing anecdotes about his experiences as a father, including a playground incident where he threatened to beat up a child who splashed his son.  This led to a broader discussion on parenting challenges, playground dynamics, and dealing with other parents. Opie shared his own experiences, and a therapist called in to comment on Opie's playground incident.  The conversation encompassed the joys and frustrations of fatherhood, including sacrifices and unexpected pleasures, and the hosts discussed their parenting styles and the balance between parenting and personal life. A caller offered their perspective on the lack of consequences for children's misbehavior.  The hosts also mentioned having Britney Spears posters in their office and an upcoming segment featuring Scott Muni's broadcast during the 1977 NYC blackout.  Louis C.K.'s Emmy nominations and the show's theme song by Ian Lloyd were also mentioned.

Further discussion with Louis C.K. detailed a spontaneous family road trip culminating in a White House tour, contrasting the perceived loss of spontaneity in parenthood.  He discussed the sacrifices of fatherhood, particularly the cessation of late-night drinking sprees. A caller described a negative experience with the police after threatening a child bully, prompting a discussion about parenting styles and bullying.  Another caller recounted their negative childhood experiences, influencing their decision not to have children.  The conversation touched on C.K.'s close family relationships despite his choice not to have children.  The discussion shifted to his FX show, "Louie," covering production details, his creative process (including intentional self-deprecation), obtaining music rights (The Who's "Who Are You"), listener responses to specific (sometimes disturbing) scenes (including one involving a decapitated homeless man and another with repeated use of "AIDS"), securing filming permits in diverse locations (NYC subway, Afghanistan), and the challenges of casting and not reusing actors.

The final segment with Louis C.K. heavily focused on the production of "Louie." He detailed the difficulty of securing Pentagon cooperation for a military episode, filming in a real apartment (and dealing with an angry neighbor), and receiving numerous listener calls praising the show, often focusing on shocking or disturbing scenes, including one involving spanking.  He described the high cost and difficulty of creating a realistic dummy head for a hit-and-run scene, including shutting down an intersection and spilling diesel fuel.  He discussed the challenges of casting, including replacing one of his daughters' actors between episodes.  The conversation moved to movie bloopers and filming mistakes from various films (*Midnight Run*, *Indiana Jones*, *Back to the Future*, *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, *The Passion of the Christ*, *Animal House*), and a mysterious scene in *The King of Comedy*.  Louis C.K. mentioned upcoming appearances on *Red Eye* and *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*,  and the hosts expressed their anxieties about their past interactions with him, recalling a time he overslept and missed a scheduled appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't that brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning, everybody.  Oh, hi. Hi, everyone. How we doing?  How we holding up?  Everybody hanging in there?  Everybody all right? 
[00:01:00]  It's a scorcher all over the country, I got to tell you.  You know, we're not local, right?  Yeah.  So I'm sure a lot of radio shows are talking about how fucking hot it is today.  Yeah.  I want to go the other direction.  I want to talk to someone that is nice and cool today.  And not because they're in AC.  Like, uh...  This show lives pretty large.  I'm looking at the map.  The only place I see...  In the United States?  ...that could be cool in the U.S.  Okay.  ...is the Pacific Northwest, maybe. 
[00:01:30]  Pacific Northwest?  Yeah.  And why do you say maybe?  Well, because they have no temperatures there.  And I think they're only doing up to, like, the 80s.  So there might be 80 degrees, something like that.  But you're looking for, like, 70s.  I'm looking for cool.  I'm looking for cool.  Well, we need Cananida.  Maybe Cananida.  A little Cananida, you think?  Yeah, because Texas is just a wreck.  Wow.  That's a weird color.  I've never seen that color on a weather map before.  Is that dangerous? 
[00:02:00]  Bubblegum means it's fucking hot.  Is bubblegum pink dangerous?  Whenever it gets bubblegum pink and almost white.  I'm used to seeing the reds, the oranges.  And the reds are like, whoa, that's hot.  Yeah, but bubblegum pink, I don't think I've ever seen that before on the weather map.  It reminds me of when you're gambling and you get those chips that are like, ooh, these  are a good ones.  What's that?  It's either a really bad chip or a really good one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes they're like 50-cent chips or something.  Might be the dollar one that they have to make change with. 
[00:02:30]  Right, right.  Or that's, like, the real good one.  That's, like, the instant tipping the waitress chip.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, okay, I get it.  The stupid white chip.  Yeah, right.  Here, I'll give you a few bucks, even though you did nothing for me.  Bubblegum pink is dangerous.  I see 107 on that map, 104.  Kenny goes to me on the way in today, it was 105 yesterday, according to my car's thermometer.  You should have took a picture and Facebooked it like the rest of the country did. 
[00:03:00]  Like everybody did?  Well, I think E-Rock did that.  Our own E-Rock did that.  Oh, he did not.  You didn't fall for that, did you?  No, because I took my car out of the garage and it said 114, so I knew that couldn't have  been right.  But you did take a picture and you tweeted it.  Yes.  Wait, what was...  Ah, Danny's shaking his head.  Can I see that picture?  Yeah, but if he got it at 114, fair enough.  But...  Fair enough.  But we all know...  It came out of a garage.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Or if you're on the highway, it's going to be a bit hotter.  And how many thermometers were really posted yesterday? 
[00:03:30]  Like, so many.  So many.  It's...  You know...  That was the Facebook bit of the day.  It was.  I don't mind the thermometer picture if it's like November and there's like some wacky  day and it's like 80 degrees.  Yeah.  Oh!  But you know what?  Folks?  It's...  It's the middle of July.  We're in the heart of summer.  I know.  It's hot outside.  I don't need to see your fucking picture.  Bubblegum pink weather.  I know.  Why did E-Rock change his avatar to...  Yeah, E-Rock looks mean now.  Why'd you do that, E-Rock?  That's not mean.  It was just a photo at a wedding that I took. 
[00:04:00]  That you thought you were...  That was taken of me.  At your own?  No.  Of course you're not married.  And you thought to what?  That you look good in that picture?  Yeah.  You went...  All right.  Fair enough.  114.  There it is.  According to E-Rock.  It just looked ridiculous.  Some guy just was on the line.  Yeah.  I think he was in the Pacific Northwest.  56 degrees.  What?  How nice would that be?  But he's not there anymore.  Oh, because it is very early in the morning.  Yeah, he must be up there in Seattle.  Yeah, man.  So, Seattle's like a high of 72 today, I think. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  A high of 72.  And they're going to have another 18 inches of rain.  Fuck those people.  Am I crazy?  I think I would love Seattle.  You know what?  That would be nice.  Raining and fucking...  You know what?  In the 50s all the time.  Yeah.  I went to Seattle once and I fucking loved it.  Really?  So, I don't know why I just trashed them.  I'll check that out.  The temperatures are nice and cool.  The humidity is nice and low.  It is cloudy.  I love cloudy days.  Me too.  I'm a huge fan of cloudy days.  I hate the sun.  I hate squinting and having to go like that all the time.  I like when I can look anywhere I want in the sky and I don't have to move my face muscles 
[00:05:00]  at all.  I have to squint.  Nothing.  I love feeling like I have a ceiling above me when I'm walking around outside.  I actually love that.  When I spent a lot of time in LA when we had some downtime, every fucking day not a cloud  in the sky.  I'm like, come on, give me a cloudy day just to mix it up a little bit.  Yeah, you can't even fucking look at anything.  And I don't mind rain either.  Me either.  Do you like thunderstorms over there or is it just rain?  It just, you know what?  When I went, the rain was not that bad. 
[00:05:30]  I think we had one storm in three days.  That is cool.  And everyone said, this is rare.  This is rare for Seattle.  It rains every day.  You're lucky.  You picked a lucky weekend.  Thunder and lightning is pretty cool.  It is.  And if that's how it was in Seattle all the time, I would never have a problem with that.  Crackling.  Oh, it's the best.  Seattle's cool.  Shit.  And car alarms start going off.  I love it.  You should book a trip to Seattle.  I'm telling you.  I loved it.  I'm sure.  I don't know why I never went back, because I really enjoyed myself there, man.  A lot of cool, hip shit to check out. 
[00:06:00]  I have other trips to take first.  Ah, yes.  Fair enough.  Link to visit the Mythbusters.  Hello.  They got ferries and all sorts of shit in the Pacific Northwest.  Oh, yeah.  They go to these faraway lands.  Little islands.  Yeah, you feel like you're going to some faraway land.  Yeah.  The temperature's different than the rest of the country.  Because this is in the top left corner of the United States.  It has kind of a nick in it.  Yeah, they got like little doodads in there with lakes and islands.  So you got to take a ferry to just see the most northern western part of the United States, 
[00:06:30]  I believe.  Yeah.  If I remember correctly.  And then it leads you to the whole rainforest.  Yeah.  Is that where Bill Gates lives?  I don't know.  I think he lives up there.  No, he lives off the big lake up there.  Yeah.  Right?  Isn't that over there?  That's outside the city of Seattle itself.  I thought he lived in that nick.  City proper.  I thought he was in that nick.  Maybe.  Maybe he moved.  I don't think so.  Doesn't he have an island or something?  Oh, maybe he moved.  I don't know.  I remember when I went, which was a while ago now. 
[00:07:00]  He had a huge lakefront.  Someone's saying Richmond.  Someone's saying Redmond.  White Bear Lake.  I don't know.  Rodman, Redmond, Richmond, what?  All right, Ant, you got 48 degrees in Colorado, 37 degrees in Idaho last night.  Yeah, well.  Here's a guy saying 10 degrees Celsius.  Oh, stop.  What is Celsius?  Well, he must be Canadian.  Stu.  Hey, how's it going?  Morning, boy.  I couldn't tell you what 10 degrees Celsius is.  I couldn't even give you a ballpark of what that is. 
[00:07:30]  I know zero is 32, so it's got to be somewhere around 40-something, right?  Me and Ant are old enough where they were trying to shove that metric shit down our throats  and change everything over in America.  And then guess what?  America said, fuck this.  Fuck you and your fucking metric system.  I can't say to blame you guys.  It's confusing as shit, this goddamn culture barrier.  All I know is that it's cold as shit.  It's 3.30 in the morning.  I just wanted to say good morning.  Hope you guys have a good one.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where are you?  Wait, wait, wait.  How is it? 
[00:08:00]  So it's 3.00?  What?  Where the fuck are you?  I forget that Canada also has time zones.  To me, it's just one.  It's just one time zone.  One shitty place.  It'd be West Coast time.  No, I know.  All right.  Where in Canada?  In B.C.  Okay.  It's in British Columbia.  Nice.  And what's the temperature in Fahrenheit?  I haven't got a clue.  You really don't know what 10 degrees Celsius is in our language? 
[00:08:30]  Like 50?  Is that what they're saying?  I haven't got a clue.  Oh, there we go.  Okay.  We got the...  Great.  It is 50.  It is.  Okay.  Okay.  That's nice.  All right.  Well, have a good day.  50 degrees.  Thank you, sir.  Just walk outside and it would be 50.  That's kind of nice.  That would be lovely.  I opened the door today to go outside to my truck and drive in and have the air conditioner  cranking in the house, of course.  And when you open that door and just get hit by the wall of muck, it's thick air that 
[00:09:00]  is hard to breathe in.  It's brutal.  It is brutal.  And rolling blackouts, they're saying.  Rolling blackouts and brownouts throughout the city.  That means at some points, if Con Ed looks at their big board and sees that they're in  the red, because a lot of people are using their air conditioners and stuff, that they'll  just go to areas that sometimes don't need some of the power. 
[00:09:30]  What happened there?  Did we just have a rolling brownout?  That could have been a rolling brownout.  No, that's crazy.  No, they will.  Con Ed will do that.  Mars.  Mars is coming in.  Dumb as they come.  Oh, my God.  Oh, now he's making believe.  Because I had to give it up.  He had his stupid headphones on when I said he's dumb as they come.  I was doing a fake rolling brownout and stupid Mars comes running down the hall. 
[00:10:00]  And now he makes believe he had something else to check.  You saw that.  Because he had the puzzled face on.  Like, why would the mic shut up?  That was a really dick move, dude.  You know how long it's going to take him to fall back asleep?  Oh, shit.  Speaking of rolling brownouts.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  We woke one of the browns out.  Oh, poor guy.  Yeah.  So Con Ed is saying that they might have to cut power. 
[00:10:30]  But you know where they cut power first.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, let's all really be real here.  They're not going to hit Midtown and places that really need the power.  You know, that shit is as real as it comes.  Oh, it certainly is.  Because I like to do Central Park loops with my bike.  Yeah.  And when you get really north in Central Park, it's in a much shittier area.  Oh, yeah.  And there's always been this, like, in the northeast corner of Central Park is this, like, big, huge pond. 
[00:11:00]  And there's a park around it.  And I have flown by this thing probably 200 to 300 times easily without stopping.  Yeah.  And one day I'm like, you know what?  I got my camera with me today.  I'm going to explore a little bit.  I'm going to check this fucking, you know, pond out to see what it's all about.  It is the shittiest part of Central Park.  And it could be beautiful.  Yeah.  And then they have, like, a playground for the kids that it looks like it was abandoned. 
[00:11:30]  And I'm going to a lot of playgrounds lately because of my kid.  Yeah.  And I'm like, holy shit, the difference between where I live and where these people live and how they, you know, keep up the maintenance on the playground.  And it's upper.  It's unbelievable.  It's upper part of Central Park.  Oh, yeah.  And there are parts of Central Park you can pretty much eat off the lawn.  You can eat off the grass.  You can eat off the bike paths and all that.  Up there, man, the grass is growing a little longer.  A little longer.  There are not as much maintenance, as many maintenance guys. 
[00:12:00]  There's shit in the water that's not in the water, you know, when you go south.  Yep.  In Central Park.  Yeah.  The bike paths are old and this stuff's starting to grow in between them, in between the cracks.  And I'm like, goddammit, that shit is real as it comes.  Come on.  We all know.  That is as real as it comes.  So you're saying that they're going to turn off their lights first.  Yeah.  I think you're looking at places like Harlem, the Bronx, certain parts of Brooklyn. 
[00:12:30]  You know, they'll get the rolling blackouts and brownouts, hence the name, I guess.  Well, we've been told to do our part here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  Right, Iraq?  There was a memo that went out and everything.  I guess the building.  And the building itself, the building, they cut back on the elevator service, the lights.  They're doing their parts.  How do you cut back on elevator service?  What are we supposed to?  You shut down a few of the elevators. 
[00:13:00]  They did that yesterday.  Iraq was saying you had to wait on line.  What, are we supposed to get a Serpa and make it up to our floor?  A Sherpa.  Oh, is it a Sherpa?  Yeah.  I make that mistake every fucking time.  We'll have to see if they're going to turn the air conditioning off again during the show.  Is it really a Sherpa?  It's a Sherpa.  Well, I said Sherpa.  See, I did it again.  It's a serpent.  Sherpa.  A Sherpent.  Fuck me.  A costume.  And I read that great book about the fucking Himalayas.  Yes.  I can't even remember the fucking word.  Sherpa.  Sherpa.  Sherpa.  That would have been a nice line. 
[00:13:30]  Right up the side of the building, yes.  It would have been a nice line if I got the fucking term correct.  All right, Iraq, what do you got, buddy?  Well, a message went out that all the buildings in Midtown have been asked to help reduce the power  and release some of the stress off the New York City power grid because of the heat.  So they're asking if you don't need anything on, your computers, your lights, your fans, turn it all off and help out.  Where are you at with that stuff?  When they tell you to do your part?  I think it's bullshit.  I don't do it.  I never do my part.  I never do my part because I'm like, I'm just one guy. 
[00:14:00]  Why would I, you know, so why should I suffer?  Everyone else will do their part.  Okay, and then it'll all even out.  Yes.  Someone else is really going to do their part, and I'm not even going to come close to doing my part.  Logically, I can't wrap my head around that.  Yeah.  So I just don't do anything.  At least I'm being honest.  I just don't do anything.  My sprinklers come on at three in the afternoon.  All right, there you go.  That's like, it's supposed to be very early in the morning.  Like, four in the morning, your sprinklers are supposed to come on. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Mine, I'm like, look, the fucking lawn and everything, it's been in the sunlight all day.  It needs water right now.  It needs to get cooled down a bit.  And that's not very economical, I hear.  But who are these people that are the do-gooders that go, I got to do my part?  I'll do my part.  Knowing that the individual itself does absolutely nothing.  Does nothing.  But you got to get a whole bunch of people that are do-gooders and are doing their part.  Like Ed Begley Jr.  And then it adds up to something.  But I figure my dumb, you know, part isn't going to do anything. 
[00:15:00]  Shut a few lights out?  Blimey.  I don't know.  I don't fucking care.  If you're doing your part, God bless you.  I just don't understand the logic of it.  Yeah, thank you for doing your part.  That means I don't have to.  Right.  I thank you for your contribution and your sacrifice.  I turned up all the AC units before I left the house.  Oh, yeah?  Ooh.  Someone's doing their part.  A little natural gas, Danny.  Sorry, buddy.  So the building has, what, shut down elevators? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, shut down elevator service.  Lighting in the lobby was shut off or partially shut off.  Yeah.  And they're asking everybody that's in this building, of which we are,  to do their part.  And I want to thank them for turning down the AC slightly,  because for the first day of the year, I could wear a short-sleeved shirt.  You're wearing short-sleeved and not freezing?  I even wear a long-sleeved in the summer,  because these stupid buildings insist on making the AC so fucking low  that it's freezing and uncomfortable. 
[00:16:00]  So I always come in here with long-sleeved shirts.  Not today, my friend.  Not today.  I think I'll wear a short-sleeved shirt maybe five, six times a year,  and possibly shorts one day a year.  Really?  Hasn't happened yet, though.  I like being a little cool in the studio.  Yeah, I like it, too, but it just seems too cold.  So they turned the AC down.  Yeah, we have to do our part here at SiriusXM.  So why do we have every single light on in this place? 
[00:16:30]  In that hallway right there, we could start shutting some lights off.  How about we shut down this fucking hallway?  There's a million lights on.  All the lights are on in all the offices,  even though no one comes to work on Friday except us,  because we're stupid.  All that track lighting out there.  What's that on for?  I don't know.  I don't think we're doing our part.  I don't know.  I don't think we're doing our part.  I don't think we're doing our part at all.  I have a really good idea.  Yeah.  They want every company to do their part in this building.  And, you know, we have a million satellite radio channels. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, the channels, yeah.  I think we should turn off some of the channels to do our part.  Just start turning some channels off.  Is that the...  Should we make a list?  Well, we got, I know one channel, or one guy that's doing his part.  Howard's doing his part.  He's doing his part.  He's pretty much as...  He's running on low power.  Very low power.  Once again, he's running on low power.  Not a lot of lights needed.  Yeah.  Equipment can be shut off.  Computers, things like that.  Yeah.  I'm sure all his studio lights are either off or very low. 
[00:17:30]  Very dimmed down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we...  Yeah, let's see.  What could we do as far as getting some of these channels off?  Cinemagic.  Cinemagic has got to be shut off immediately.  Cinemagic.  I know it's an online channel at this point, but let's just shut it down.  Cinemagic.  We've got to do our part so this place doesn't suffer from a brownout.  Kevin from Connecticut suggesting getting rid of the 40s on 4. 
[00:18:00]  40s on 4?  Shut her down.  Shut it down.  We really don't need to hear...  Yeah, we don't need that.  How many channels do we have?  Wow.  I say we've got to cut 10% of the channels.  10%?  So if we have how many?  I think there's like 206 channels.  206?  Not including the channels that they turn on occasionally for sports, for live games.  Really?  All right.  So we've got to get rid of 20?  I don't know if we want to do this bit for 20 fucking channels. 
[00:18:30]  I don't think so either.  Right after the Cinemagic and...  And the 40s on 4.  And the 40s on 4.  Where else do we go?  We could certainly turn off all the Clear Channel channels because they're on regular radio.  We power that down right about now.  Oh, man.  How great would that be?  Power down right now.  How great would that be?  Oh, would that be nice.  Actually, if we get rid of Stars, that could solve a lot of problems.  Stars?  Yeah.  Because then you get rid of Broad-Minded.  Ah, right.  True.  Some other shows that are on that channel on that cat stand. 
[00:19:00]  I hear Stars is just limping along, too.  That's an injured channel.  And as like an edit bonus, Don Wickland's in charge.  Oh, damn.  A Broad-Minded?  Kind of like a bonus.  Yeah, I think he does Broad-Minded.  I guess not the whole channel.  Got to keep out cute because, you know, you get rid of them.  Then there's a homophobic thing that happens and stuff.  Damn.  So just keep those guys right where they are and keep them fucking calm.  People start going a little crazy.  Oh, Rosie Radio.  Goodbye.  Well, she does it from her house.  All right. 
[00:19:30]  I don't think she does it anymore.  Wait a minute.  Really?  Yeah.  From what I understand...  There are pictures everywhere.  From what I understand, she's now preparing for her Oprah channel show.  Uh-huh.  But her producers are doing the show.  Oh, great.  She took their money and ran.  She's franchising.  So she pretty much does what we do at 10 o'clock.  Right.  Remember that lady we used to see being pushed in a chair across the hallway and she was holding  a little flip cam?  Yes.  From what somebody told me, those are the Rosie Radio people. 
[00:20:00]  They were her producers or advisors or something.  And they're the ones doing the show now.  So Rosie...  Logo, her face, pictures.  We've been here two years slaving it out and they still haven't decided...  Well, I guess they have decided not to put our logo up anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  We're not anywhere.  Those fucking assholes.  Wow.  Kids place life.  But Rosie takes their money and runs.  Oh, yeah.  She certainly did.  She doesn't even have to do her show anymore. 
[00:20:30]  That's great.  We still have Dr. Laura, so...  Where's she?  Radio Disney.  Remember when she was the big get?  No one has talked about Dr. Laura.  Nothing.  Laura, since she signed her.  No buzz.  What channel is she on?  I don't even know.  I think stars.  Oh, there's all the Canadians.  All right.  We just hit the motherhood.  There's all the Canadians.  Wow.  We could get rid of all these.  The Verge.  What the fuck is The Verge?  What's The Verge?  What do they do?  What do they do?  Does anyone know?  The Verge.  Air Music. 
[00:21:00]  Music QE.  Music QE.  Sir La Root.  What the hell is that?  How do you say that really?  I said scoreboard.  Sir La Root.  Sir La Root.  I don't know.  Some foreign language.  What's Queen de l'oeuf?  Canada 360.  Look at 158.  Que de l'oeuf.  Que de l'oeuf.  That means which way is north?  Yeah, which way is north?  And what's calendar?  I think that's what is. 
[00:21:30]  Is that what is new?  Did you do the sportif?  I think it is.  I don't know.  What's sportif calendar?  That's the sports calendar.  Duh.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  I should have figured that one out.  I don't know.  No, you're right.  And you should have said duh to me.  I should have got that one at least.  Here's a chunk of things we could take out.  There's the Kiss and Z100 and Light FM and all these.  I would love to see numbers finally.  Who the fuck?  Go back.  Who the fuck is listening to Que de l'oeuf? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Que de l'oeuf.  Yeah, come on.  Now, honestly.  Who the fuck is listening to Que de l'oeuf?  I'd love to know numbers.  Is that news?  Iraq, what is Que de l'oeuf?  Que de l'oeuf.  I don't know, but some of those channels are in French for French Canadians.  Oh, really?  But I can't read the description for it.  Did you just say that?  You make it so easy to beat you up.  I don't know, but some of those are in French.  Because I can't read the description for it.  But we just said Que de l'oeuf. 
[00:22:30]  It's pretty much.  I think anyone would know that's French.  This channel sounds pretty cool.  It's XM158.  This channel sounds pretty cool.  Art and entertainment have no boundaries from new movies, DVD releases, concerts, shows, and theater.  Yeah, it does sound cool, but it's in French.  It's in French.  Video games.  They talk about all this cool shit.  In French.  But the problem is, it's in French.  It's French language arts and entertainment.  That's the only channel we're allowing the Canadians to have.  Why?  Yeah, yank it. 
[00:23:00]  You know how hard it is to get an audience on satellite radio to begin with?  Now you've decided to do your programming in French?  How many fucking French people could there possibly be?  All right, wipe it out.  I have a radio here if you want to try to listen to the French channel.  Yeah, let's do this.  All right, let's hear a little of that.  Is this quoi le nôtre?  At least it sounds good.  They all just sound like assholes, right?  This is Epi and Antoine. 
[00:23:30]  They're talking about vagina.  Ah, Frère Jacques.  Opi avec Anthony.  Opi avec Antoine.  And then they have Asian radio.  What?  What the hell is that?  What?  Asian radio.  What were these deals about?  That's got everything.  Bollywood, Bonanza.  Yeah, I don't know.  Prayer. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Morning.  All right, well.  What kind of wacky things do they do on that channel?  Like, speak in an American accent?  Talk about how good people drive?  Mikey.  I know Mikey.  Talk about food that fills you up for a while.  That's really funny.  We got a big wig from XM Canada.  A big wig.  Mike from Canada.  Mikey.  Mikey.  Not a big wig.  It's Rossi from Hockey this morning on NHL Home.  Oh. 
[00:24:30]  I know you.  So, the voice of Calendrier Sportif on XM 97.  What?  What is that language?  Yeah.  What language?  Le Calendrier Sportif.  Ah, that's French.  I give you the time to start of all the hockey, baseball, football, and course automobile  on XM 97, le Calendrier Sportif.  I got to tell you, I filled up a little bit right there.  And I'll tell you why.  Because it makes me miss Turks and Caicos.  Oh.  They do a little French down there, especially if you go to the Club Med, which I haven't 
[00:25:00]  gone in many, many years.  Yeah.  But that fucking accent when it's coming from a hot brud.  Wow.  That was impressive.  Where'd you learn that?  Yeah.  Well, half my family's French, so it helps, yeah.  But how do you know English then?  Your brain's only suited for one language.  It really is.  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  How do you learn that?  How do you learn it?  You go to school.  You know why I know that?  Because I took six years of Spanish, and guess what, man? 
[00:25:30]  Not a word.  Not a lick.  And I passed, by the way.  I did two years of Spanish, and I failed.  How about this?  Six years of Spanish, never dreamed in Spanish once.  Proving my point that your brain is only equipped for one language.  That's true.  After six years, you would think some kind of Spanish would have entered my dreams.  Except that when you grow up in a house where mom speaks French, dad speaks English, you pick them both up.  Sir, do you dream in French sometimes? 
[00:26:00]  I don't think so.  English is the universal language.  It sure is.  It is.  The dialogue is one way.  I think English is the language of God.  It really is.  It's the language of air traffic controllers and pilots.  It's the language of your subconscious, I should say.  Well, you know what?  Not everyone believes in God.  Yes, yes.  You say that about air traffic controllers, except back in the 80s up here, there was a big brouhaha  because the French-language air traffic controllers in the province of Quebec wanted to be allowed to speak in French, 
[00:26:30]  and the English guys made a big to-do about the fact that there should only be one language in the air traffic controller towers.  There should be.  There were actually resignations from the federal government at the time, people upset about the whole thing.  So we've been down that road before.  Well, it's state English, my friend.  That's right.  Because English rules.  So here's the bottom line with the French-English thing, and I've said this for a long time.  At the Plains of Abraham in Quebec, the English beat the French, and yet they allowed them to keep their language and their rights for religion and language, 
[00:27:00]  and that is where they went wrong.  If they wanted to keep it all, that's where they made a left turn.  See that?  So you work for Home Ice, right?  Yeah, I do the hockey this morning.  Obviously not much going on in hockey this morning.  Well, Brandon Dubinsky signed.  Yeah, I saw that.  Well, how about that?  With the Rangers.  Cozy minute and a half of radio.  That's a big signing.  Big signing for the bad guys. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, the bad guys.  And Jonas Enrov signed in Buffalo.  So this week has just been about Stamkos and his deal.  Wait, you didn't explain the French channels, or did you?  Okay, I'll explain that to you.  All right.  Unlike the U.S., where the FCC doesn't really have anything to say about satellite radio, in Canada it's called the CRTC, that's the Federal Telecommunications Commission, and they have their paws all over it.  And so for every one channel that we want to bring to Canadian listeners on satellite radio, we have to produce nine other channels. 
[00:28:00]  And there are rules that are imposed as far as not only Canadian content, but language content, so French language content.  And in fact, the most recent condition put on us after the merger here in Canada between Sirius and XM was the establishing of an aboriginal channel.  So that's got to be set up in the next couple months. 
[00:28:30]  What?  Wait, aboriginal?  I know what that means in Australia.  Power that down.  What does that mean in Canada?  Well, it means native Canadian programming.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  We're beating up the company a little bit and making fun, but I know, I've talked to a few people, they fucking hate that they're involved with this deal, but they have no choice.  They don't want French fucking channels part of Sirius XM.  But it's the law.  But it's the law.  And they don't want the clear channel shit, but it's the law. 
[00:29:00]  Well, that's more of a deal that they brokered, unfortunately, in the beginning when they kind of needed, you know, financing.  Come on.  But both those things, they would love to go away.  It's also the reason why the French channel that I do sounds like I'm doing it, you know, through 14 tin cans.  And they only have four bits.  Not much bandwidth, eh?  No.  They don't sacrifice too much.  No, not so much.  I mean, we're looking at French pop channels. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What the hell goes on there?  Like the French music.  There is a lot of French Canadian music that definitely gets a lot of play.  How about this?  Do you know anything about French pop music?  Yes.  Give me the most popular French pop song out right now.  Right now?  That I couldn't tell you right now.  But I could give you artist names.  My wife's a big French music listener.  So if you talked about Maxim and André, if you talked about Marie-Eve-Dumas. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, of course you have to.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  J'amara Quai.  I think he did go over there and become a huge hit.  Did he?  After we were done with his dumb one hit.  You know, that's the truth.  One hit in the States and he's massively huge somewhere else.  Somewhere else.  Yeah.  We were done with that idiot.  Celery.  With that stupid floor that was moving.  Or was it the walls?  I don't know.  Was it the ceiling? 
[00:30:30]  What the fuck was moving in that room?  That was a wacky video, wasn't it?  Mikey, is this pop artist, though, you're talking about?  Yeah, those are pop artists.  All right.  Well, I mean, E-Rock's having a tough time.  E-Rock, could you find a song by any one of those artists?  I don't even know how these names start.  What letter do you mean?  Yeah.  I'm just smashing the keys.  Yeah.  Could you?  You've got to spell it out for E-Rock.  M as in Michael.  A-X-I-M-E. 
[00:31:00]  Maxime.  M-A-X-I-M-E.  All right.  Let's start.  That's good enough.  Maxime.  Do you find anything in there?  How do you spell the last name?  L-A-N-D-R-Y.  Okay.  I found three songs.  There you go.  And I can't pronounce any of them.  Try.  This will be fun.  Yeah, try.  This one looks like it says cachet, cachet.  Yeah.  Talk it up, E-Rock.  This one is Chez Nous Avant La Nuit. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And wow, I got that.  And this has apostrophes.  La Nive.  What?  Yeah.  What?  He doesn't even know what the one is.  La Nive?  Yeah, that.  The first one's about his dad.  La Nive.  The first one's about what?  The first one's about his dad who committed suicide.  Oh, that's a fun pop song.  Yeah.  Sounds great.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, E-Rock.  Hold on.  What?  It won him the... 
[00:32:00]  The province of Quebec, one of the networks up there has sort of the Quebec Idol type show.  Yeah.  And that sent him on his way and actually won him the contest.  All right.  So this is a very popular French pop song, right?  Yes, it is.  How do you know when a French pop song gets old?  I don't know.  That's a very good question.  Well, of course it is.  I've never thought of it.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  This is one of the biggest pop songs.  Very big pop song.  All right. 
[00:32:30]  Do they rhyme like our songs?  Yeah.  Or the words not make sense.  I know they clear their throat a lot.  How can you sing a romantic song when it's part of the song?  It's like the French Elton John. 
[00:33:00]  I was just guessing that's the part where his dad died.  You know, committing suicide.  I'm not feeling this.  Nah, get rid of this shit.  Give me some Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  Yeah.  Marry that.  Clean that shit up. 
[00:33:30]  Uncle Paul might like that.  Although Neil Young's from Canada, so...  It's about playing hide-and-seek with his dad who eventually committed suicide.  Yeah.  Damn.  Oh, yeah.  Alex Bennett off.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  List done.  Yeah.  All right, Mikey.  We're saving power.  All right, boys.  I don't know what else to do to you.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I have no interest in the French culture.  The only reason I took French in high school was because the teacher was really hot and smelled good.  Exactly.  It's all about two words, guys.  French chicks.  Yeah?  Okay, absolutely. 
[00:34:00]  I married one.  I mean, it's working out good for me.  Does she at least shave her armpits?  Yes.  All right.  That's good.  Then you got a good one.  Go for you.  All right, sir.  Take care.  Mike, thanks for supporting the show.  I know you do that, and I appreciate it.  I want to do some hockey shit with you guys this year.  Well, we'd love to.  I mean, we've been talking about it here for a while, and, you know, anything that we can do  to cross-morting shows, and we're a big fan of you guys.  We listen to you guys all the time on the replay when we're out.  All right.  And now we're in our summer hours, so we get the hell out of here at 9 o'clock. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, 9.  How the fuck did you get summer hours?  You're a nobody.  Well, because we worked 16-hour days during the hockey season.  Dude, what are we doing wrong?  Look down the hall.  No one's going to be here today.  No one's here.  This guy, who has maybe a couple hundred listeners, gets summer hours.  I don't get it.  All right, Mike.  Have a good weekend, boys.  You too.  You too.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  Summer hours. 
[00:35:00]  Summer fucking hours.  What the fuck did we agree to?  Oh, man.  Please.  We know what we agreed to.  Oh, boy.  So this next thought, I want to run by you, Ed.  All right.  Because I might have taken too much heat in yesterday playing golf.  Yeah.  And this is what I was thinking.  I was getting off the golf course, so my brain might have been fried because I was out there  playing golf.  Happens.  I want to acknowledge that.  But you know how the divorce rate is really high? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I think I finally figured it all out, why people are incompatible and they're getting divorced.  This is giant news.  Yeah.  This would be like huge.  Yeah.  But you got to, and I wasn't high because I'm not smoking pot.  All right.  Now, actually, I want to start.  You're a really smart man.  I try.  Back in the day.  What we call the day.  Yes.  How was one attracted to the other?  Think animalistic. 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  I believe by sight first.  You would look and be attracted to somebody.  And then there is a fragrance type thing.  Pheromones.  Oh, man.  You're playing right into this beautifully.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very good.  What else?  But this is how you first are attracted to somebody.  Sight and fragrance mostly, right?  Sight.  Smell.  Smell?  Yes.  All right.  Look what I wrote down.  This is why I think the divorce rate is so high.  I blame perfumes and colognes. 
[00:36:30]  Wow.  This is my theory that I thought of walking off the golf course.  You're blaming perfumes and colognes for divorce.  And I'll tell you why.  I smelled this perfume that I'm like, wow, I really like this perfume.  And then I looked at the person, and she was a pig.  Oh, shit.  And I'm thinking to myself that people might get a little confused.  Because they like certain scents that are man-made.  And then they think, because this person is wearing the scent I like. 
[00:37:00]  In an animal way, you're attracted to them.  Right.  But in no other way would this work.  It's hiding the real scent that you probably would not be attracted to.  Right.  You know what?  I think I'm with you on this.  Really?  Yeah.  It makes perfect sense.  But by that-  It's covering up.  By that argument, you're going to have to ban all sorts of makeup.  I know.  Yeah, well, that's another funny thing.  I understand what this means.  This is very tragic. 
[00:37:30]  But I'm telling you, this is the thought I had.  I think when, before perfumes, there was actually some kind of attraction because you smelled-  The natural scent.  That you were into.  Yeah.  Because let's be honest, when you smell some scents, natural scents, you're like, get  the fuck away from me.  Yeah.  But other natural scents, you're like, you know what?  That's nice.  I like that.  I like that.  I could live with that.  And I think fucking perfume and cologne has fucked it up.  It's fucked everything up.  We're not using our natural abilities anymore to be attracted to something. 
[00:38:00]  You know what?  I think you're right.  Divorce rate, high, perfume and cologne.  I blame perfume and cologne.  I wonder if a study's been done.  I bet it has.  I don't know.  I think when this one hit me yesterday, I'm like, fuck, I think I'm onto something.  So now I got to do some research on the internet to see if they even study this shit.  You're going to research?  Well, there's popular fucking perfumes.  Yeah.  There are some perfumes.  If I smell them, I'm losing my fucking mind.  What about the Biebs?  The Biebs' new perfume. 
[00:38:30]  Ugh.  What about Jennifer Aniston?  Ugh.  Supposedly she had a good one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Just to cover up, you know, her natural scent.  There are those flowery ones?  Yeah.  So let's say there's a girl at your office or whatever you're attracted to, but she's  wearing one of those kind of old lady-ish flowery perfumes.  Can't have that.  Are you now attracted to her still?  No.  You might be because of the sight thing, but I think then smelling a perfume you're not 
[00:39:00]  really into could maybe push you away from someone that you might have been compatible  to.  Yeah.  What do you think?  I like the way this plays out because it makes sense.  It's very primal.  Mm-hmm.  Very animal.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I think a further study is needed.  You think?  Further study.  Did we do anything this first hour?  Oh, yeah.  We saved power?  No, we did.  Yeah.  We came in.  We appeared.  We appeared.  We were here. 
[00:39:30]  It seems like that's all you have to do if you work for SiriusXM is just show up.  Just show up when they actually want you to.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  This guy, yes, with a lot of asses.  I dated a girl for six years because she wore Dolce Gabbana or whatever.  Dolce Gabbana.  Light blue perfume.  And then one day I realized that why didn't you bring this up years ago?  I just came up with this.  On the golf course?  Coming off the golf course.  Actually, going back into my building because I saw this. 
[00:40:00]  It was a little later, but I think I was suffering from heat stroke.  You smelled something good.  And I turned and I'm like, what the fuck, man?  That could confuse a young man like myself.  This guy's calling bullshit on my theory?  How dare you, Joe?  Joe.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Joe.  Hola.  Well, I'll give your theory some credence.  You know, it's got a point or two, but I want to say this.  When you're with a woman for long enough, she's not been wearing that perfume all the time. 
[00:40:30]  You're going to smell what she smells like naturally, no?  Oh, my God.  But that proves my theory.  All of a sudden, that perfume that you were attracted to is going away.  Now you're starting to smell the natural scents a little more because you're with the person.  And then you're like, fuck, I'm not into this person.  The lawyer gets called.  Right.  Divorce is like 60%, 70% right now.  I think you've proven my theory by saying that.  And if she kept her perfume on, then maybe at that point, I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  Then you find out you're incompatible in every other way because you're not supposed to be together because the smell fucked you up.  Right.  So you're doomed anyway.  Perfume on, perfume off.  I'm saying.  After you get married.  I'm saying, because it is a little complicated.  I'm saying if we all blew off our colognes and perfumes, then I think you would be attracted to someone through, like Ant said, sight and their natural odor.  Yes. 
[00:41:30]  Natural stank.  Anything, sir?  I think he's converted.  He's done.  We converted him.  Oh, here we go.  Dude, by the way, I brought this up as a goof.  But now people have people running with it.  Cameron in Texas.  Go ahead, Cameron.  Cam?  Yes.  Hello, fellas.  Hello.  All right, guys.  I met my girlfriend through a friend of mine. 
[00:42:00]  And the only reason I liked her at first is because she had an awesome perfume and smelled amazing.  And it doesn't help that she is a little attractive.  Uh-huh.  So now we live together, and I can't stand the fucking smell of her, her pussy.  It smells terrible, and I don't want to be with her.  Ah, see?  The perfume, gotcha.  And then the attractiveness.  No.  No?  She wasn't spraying perfume on her cunt.  Like, you knew it stank in the first place.  Oh, hold on a minute. 
[00:42:30]  There's things that girls do to make sure that it doesn't smell too bad.  Yeah, they got all kinds of products.  And then maybe when you're with somebody, they let some things go a little bit.  There's a lot more vagina products than there are cock products.  That's right.  I'll be honest.  I bet you can't even name five cock products.  What?  Like a condom?  All right.  That's one.  That's one.  There's a whole aisle for pussy shit.  For pussies.  Name five.  I'm trying.  Condom?  All right.  Maybe a little powder for the balls? 
[00:43:00]  Maybe just a little powder?  Yeah, but that could be used elsewhere.  I'm talking strictly cock products.  Cock products.  Vaginas got Vagisil, then they got that thing if you're too dry, then they got the smell  shit, they got douches, they got tampons.  You know, there's a fuckload of things for vaginas.  Special razors to shave.  Yes.  Special Vag razors.  They don't sell special cock and ball razors.  What about...  Oh, E-Rock's saying that we advertise fresh balls.  Fresh balls, but really. 
[00:43:30]  Can you go on the store and get that?  But really, does a guy give a shit if he has fresh balls?  Oh!  Balls across the nose.  I have a version of that in my bathroom.  It's just called baby powder.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe you want to put a little powder on.  Fresh balls.  Everyone's saying fresh balls.  I guess the advertising does work on this, too.  Yeah.  No, there's not...  No.  There's not really any specific dick items, and there's a lot of pussy stuff. 
[00:44:00]  And it doesn't make sense, because our dicks are hanging outside our body.  Hanging out!  You'd think we'd need a little more stuff.  More care.  A little more care.  There's no dick aisle in the pharmacy.  No, there's not.  There's a feminine hygiene, which was pretty much pussy aisle.  But there's no cock aisle.  Have you walked down that aisle lately at a CVS?  Oh, it's packed with everything.  It's mind-boggling.  There's all kinds of vagina stuff there.  I don't even know what half this shit is.  It's amazing.  It's too dry.  It's too wet.  It smells.  It doesn't smell enough.  It's too hairy.  The pH is a little off. 
[00:44:30]  pH?  Yeah, it's like a pool.  You've got to dip a fucking litmus paper in it.  Women have to worry about their pH.  Their pH.  What the fuck is that about?  Just worry about their PU.  Their pH makes the PU.  Oh, cock rings, of course.  That's in the cock aisle at CVS.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to find that at CVS.  Of course.  Cock rings.  Thank you.  Oh, stop.  You ever wear a cock ring?  I've never put on a cock ring.  And Jimmy would be yelling at us right now.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  What are you crazy?  But he's in San Diego.  Of course.  I've never worn a cock ring.  Jimmy, you've got these great disposable ones now with the little...  Wait, you've worn a cock ring?  Come on!  Everybody that's done that has to answer like that.  Yeah, come on.  What's wrong with you?  I just...  I don't know.  It's crazy.  You've got a little nub on top.  You turn it on.  It starts going wacky.  Oh, it's a vibrating one.  I just don't want to look silly when I'm having sex.  You're going to, but it can be worth it sometimes.  It would make you look silly. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know.  Can't you just use your fucking thumb and forefinger?  That's not the point.  It's not for...  Give the A-OK sign around the base of your dick.  Sure, you could, but it's not really...  It's not for you.  Oh.  You know, at least the...  Her pleasure.  Well, the vibrating cock rings.  I mean, that's not for my pleasure.  Right.  I swear the perfume thing was a goof, but we're getting into a couple good stories.  John in Alabama.  Listen to this one.  John.  Hey, Jen.  Hey.  Hey.  My niece came over with two of her friends.  They go swimming in my pool and everything.  They're college girls. 
[00:46:00]  All the college girls, all nice and tan.  Unbelievable.  Bikinis, toned.  Oh, why don't you keep talking?  I'm a fucking pro at this.  Trying to paint a picture.  I'm trying to get Guy's heart out there through your story, and you're fucking blowing it.  He's painting a picture.  Yeah.  You got college girls.  They're tan.  They're in bikinis, right?  Right.  We're drinking margaritas now, by the pool.  I can't work with this guy.  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh.  No, go ahead, John.  Go ahead.  Okay.  She takes off this wrap and throws it over the chair that I was sitting on, and it had 
[00:46:30]  the most unbelievable perfume smell on it.  And they were all swimming and everything.  And they came back, and they started talking about sex with guys and all this shit.  I found out the perfume was that DKNY shit.  Yeah.  And my wife's next birthday, I went and bought her a damn thing of it.  And every time she wears it, I think of that day.  Ah.  Just so you can think.  A little yellow bikini.  God damn.  He got his wife to wear something that reminds him of a college chick's fucking bikini. 
[00:47:00]  Fucking.  That's great.  Because they came over once and swam in your pool.  You got all fucking hard.  That's hilarious.  You should have seen that fucking bikini now.  Oh.  This guy loves that bikini.  And I imagine your wife doesn't really wear a bikini now, does she?  No.  You're like, why don't you put on some of that perfume?  Why don't you put on some of that perfume again?  Oh, my God.  That's funny, man.  Thank you, Chuck.

No.  Because why would you choose, it's an old gag, but a hairy man's ass when you could have  that.  This is just Spring Break Bikini Contest.  Why wouldn't you choose this every time?  In Google search with your filters off.  Right.  And it's fucking.  Yeah, make sure you have your filters off.  That is.  Oh, my God.  What guy wouldn't choose that if you had a choice? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, I'd love a nice big hairy cock.  Oh, get that away.  We're looking fucking ten girls in front of a Bud Light sign at a bar in a bikini just  looking fucking.  Besides on their head, not a hair to be had between all of them.  Oh, they're just stunning.  Girls.  Damn you, girls.  Damn you.  And your bodies and tits and your pussies, asses, legs.

Because after an hour, what else is there? 
[00:49:30]  Sleep.  What else is there, really?  Pool.  It's called, you know, fill up the next three hours.  Next three hours filler.  That's why everyone's doing an hour, hour and a half, two hours tops podcast.  Right.  Because that's all you got in your brain.  It's the wave of the future.  Oh, God.  Who can't do two hours on a podcast?  It's just girls on the beach.  Oh, that's icky, right?  Oh, God.  Ew.  Ew.  Girls on the beach in bikinis.  God.  Oh.  Like, how do you...  I don't understand. 
[00:50:00]  All right, that moan is a little too real there.  What?  You had a...  Oh.  The moan was a little too...  I'm moaning at these pictures.  They're fucking fantastic.  There's so much jacking material on a search engine.  Oh, yeah.  If you can't just find fucking jacking material, what's that site that you fucking...  It's called Google.  Fuck that.  It's called Google.  I'd rather check out this shit than hardcore porn.  Of course.  Really?  Yes.  I don't want some dumb fucking bleach blonde fake-titted girl.  These are all natural fucking chicks on the beach. 
[00:50:30]  I thought I was...  I thought it wasn't in the norm.  What's norm got to do with it?  Wouldn't you rather check out, like...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'd rather check out regular girls.  Regular girls.  Beautiful girls.  There's a Twitter account I follow.  It's...  I like girls daily.  Oh, yeah.  Just fucking girls, man.  Girls, girls.  Every once in a while...  No, I wouldn't say...  I was going to say every once in a while a porn chick, but no, that's not true.  No, no.  Rarely... 
[00:51:00]  Rarely there's breast implants.  There's...  I hate when they slip in a fucking, like, fake bleach blonde.  No, man.  These are girls just getting ready to go out or go to the beach, and they had to take that picture of themselves.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like girls daily.  It's one of the best Twitter accounts ever.  Wow.  Ever.  We got to get this woman on the show, because I guess she's, like, bi or something, or likes girls herself.  Oh, it's a chick that does it?  Yeah.  And so she understands a chick's body. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, okay, okay.  Fucking A.  That is so much hotter than hardcore porn for me.  That is a mirror shot.  And she's got all her clothes on.  Well, she's got a little bit of red panties on.  The voice short kind of thing.  Yeah, what are they called?  How great is this to scroll down?  Because I clicked it, and I'm like, all right, whatever.  And then I went to scroll, and I was like, oh.  She's turning her ass to the mirror.  What was Mars' fucking bang?  Yeah.  Bang.  When Jennifer Lopez walked by, what did he say?  Bang.  Well, that's insane.  And this Twitter account, that's all she does. 
[00:52:00]  All day long.  All day long.  All day long?  Oh, that's dumb.  All day long?  She doesn't have to have that.  Just a sign that says, oh, come on.  Why am I clicking on this shit?  That crap.  I mean, you'll know which one to click on.  I think she feels like she has to tweet every once in a while, so she'll pop something on it.  Wow.  Someone with see-through leggings bending over.  Leggings rule.  Leggings do get a little thin when they're stretched.  Yeah, my follow Friday today is,  I like girls daily. 
[00:52:30]  It is some ass.  And I think she's got...  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  That's way better than hardcore porn.  Selena Gomez, 18 today?  18.  18 today.  That went quickly.  You know, usually people look an ant for being the pervy type, but I'm a big Selena Gomez fan.  She's legal.  She's totally legal now, too.  Another one.  We lost another one, right, Ant?  Lost another one to legality.  Shit.  So much creepier when they...  Oh, my God. 
[00:53:00]  You know, we never got to the Britney Spears story yesterday.  No.  She was one we used to really gawk at, if you remember.  Yeah.  We had the posters in our office and the salespeople and the upper management thought we were creeps.  Of course, she was legal.  We had Britney Spears posters in our office that were meant for, like, 12-year-old girls.  Yeah.  But we had them up in our office, and she turned out to just be fucking disgusting.  She's a pig.  If you want to believe what they say about her.  Yeah.  Where she doesn't shower for days. 
[00:53:30]  She has bad breath.  She farps.  She picks her nose.  Yeah.  She's a mess.  She walks around in little 90s and bends all the way over, and guys don't want to have sex with her.  She must.  If she doesn't shower and shit, she must have an odor problem.  There's rumors of a little bit of some drugs here and there.  Oh, really?  Rumors?  I don't know.  It's true.  Well, it's in a lawsuit, but you never know with lawsuits.  Who the fuck knows?  It's true.  Whatever.  All right.  I think we're going to take a break.  Yeah.  We accomplished a lot here.  We did. 
[00:54:00]  We're in the middle of a heat wave here in New York.  Yes.  Watch out.  Check the elderly.  Oh.  Eric.  Yeah.  Kenny.  Shush.  Kenny.  Shush.  What is he saying?  Oh, he's talking about snowing.  Or something.  Kenny.  That's just my dandruff.  It's not snowing.  It's my dry scalp.  Hey, Eric.  Yeah.  For the 10 o'clock hour today, could we play our classic Scott Muni broadcasting? 
[00:54:30]  From the blackout?  From the blackout?  I think I have that.  That'll be good.  It's one of my favorite bits, man.  That one's funny.  Yes.  A long time ago, New York City had a massive blackout.  Scott Muni decided a legendary DJ.  That's her?  Oh, God.  It was.  Well, then she got her body back together a little bit.  Yeah.  But look at what Britney used to look like on the left there.  I know you can't see this in this radio, but just put the picture in your own head.  They have 99 in 2009, and wow, what a difference. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Even that.  What the hell?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you can see some pudge happening there.  She's just a mess.  Anyway, Scott Muni, a legendary jock that we got to know, and who was just nothing but nice and a class act to me and Ant.  Yes.  When he knew changes were coming.  He broadcast.  What year was that from?  The tapes were for 1977.  That's what I mean.  Wow.  Okay, yeah.  So there was a massive blackout in New York City in 1977. 
[00:55:30]  Scott Muni decided he still needed to do his show, so he went to the, what?  He went to the transmitter site.  The actual transmitter.  Which I think was at the Empire State Building.  Of course.  And still did his show, even though there was a blackout.  Yeah.  And, you know, back then, a lot of people walked around with transistor radios and stuff.  Transistor radios.  And when you have a blackout, you're certainly going to search out a radio to try to get info.  Batteries.  And we got a hold of these tapes from 1977, and then we did our thing.  Yeah.  Obviously. 
[00:56:00]  Can we play that in the 10 o'clock hour?  I think it's appropriate today.  I think we can.  Let me go look for it.  All right.  Try to find that shit.  Yeah.  And if we're going to do that, we'll promote it, because I want people to hear that if  they've never heard it.  We had a lot of fun with that.  Yes.  We have a nice surprise for everyone today.  We really do.  Jimmy's out there being a star in Hollywood.  A star.  Between Comic-Con and Jay Leno.  He's a very busy man.  Yeah.  Coming in today to hang with us today.  Coming in today to hang with us today.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Emmy Award nominee.  Louis C.K.  Louis C.K.  Yes.  He should be joining the show next.  Stay there.  Want to get in touch with O&A?  Just call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Smartphone users, send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I met this guy. 
[00:57:00]  He gets his own music now.  He's got his own music for the radio show.  He used to just come in and it was just like, oh, Louis is here.  I don't see.  Now he gets his own music where he comes into.  That's right.  Don't you think that's the cheesiest thing ever on radio or any other medium?  When they play your music?  Yeah.  When they play the music that you're associated with.  Yeah.  People out there are loving it, though.  Are they? 
[00:57:30]  Absolutely.  Is that something we don't realize?  Because this song is so fucking cool.  Well, it is cool.  And I met the guy.  It's a cool song.  I met the guy at the premiere.  I was more excited to meet him than anybody else.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was sitting at a table trying to be uber polite and saying, you know, I did the theme song.  But okay, I'll sit over here.  It's all right.  It's okay.  He's a great guy, Ian Lloyd.  Wow.  I love them.  We talked for a couple minutes.  Yeah, he did.  Our version is our own.  We made that ourselves. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And he sang it for us.  Yeah.  Couldn't find anybody else who could touch it.  The guy.  That's right.  The guy.  From the stories.  The premiere that we went to, what a great response from everybody.  That was pretty good, yeah.  It was just fantastic, man.  The show's great.  What can you say?  It's so goddamn good.  Thanks, guys.  It's so fucking good.  Thanks.  I think we're three episodes in already, right?  Four.  Four?  Four, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, no, last night it was five.  Last night was five.  Oh, man.  Oh, last night was five already?  Yeah.  I'm one behind that, I think. 
[00:58:30]  I'm one back, yeah.  I'm one back, too.  Damn it.  Last night was the old Racist Aunt episode.  Oh, I can't wait to see it.  It's pretty good.  I ruined it for you already.  It's all right.  I'll still love it.  It's the journey of the show.  That's right.  Not so much the destination.  Yes.  How do you feel about being nominated for an Emmy?  Great.  It was, you know, it makes for a really great morning when you find out.  Yeah, yeah.  And I didn't think I would get four.  That was stupid.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  I didn't think I'd get best actor. 
[00:59:00]  That was not anywhere near the radar.  It's crazy.  So what?  Yeah, I actually don't think it's that appropriate.  The show, best actor, and what else?  And then writing for the show.  Wow.  And then writing for my special.  Hilarious.  Oh, wow.  And editing my special.  Wow.  So editing.  Picture editing of a variety special.  That's what happens.  That's the one I'm going to get, probably.  That's what happens when you do all your own shit.  Yeah.  When you get nominated, you really get nominated.  You get more.  What if you get all four?  Are you going to have four Emmys? 
[00:59:30]  I will have four then, yeah.  I want to see him just get the fourth one, stand up there with all four in two hands.  Yeah!  Just being a real asshole about it.  Yeah!  That would be a great move to just be a huge asshole about it.  Does a huge asshole about it.  Yeah.  Not gracious or anything.  That's not Louie.  This is because I'm better than all of you.  You all suck.  This is proof.  You don't have these.  This is proof.  I think I sort of have to apologize to Louie because I gave him a backwards compliment,  but I want to maybe try to explain further. 
[01:00:00]  What happened?  What happened?  You don't have to apologize.  I'm not.  And I don't even know why.  I'm not a huge fan of Joan Rivers.  I'm really not.  And I don't know why.  I probably should be, right?  I don't have to be.  But I love the Joan Rivers episode and Louie, and I don't know how that came across to you.  And I just...  No, I don't have any...  She's not my mom or anything.  But I think it was trying to show how good this damn show is because you humanized her.  And I really...  And I actually...  I think I like her now, too.  Yeah, she's a very likable person. 
[01:00:30]  She works really hard.  Right.  She showed up and she was so into it.  And like when I was taking breaks, she was still running lines.  Really?  It was really important to her to do it well.  She seems like that from the documentary I saw on her.  Yeah.  Like she's constantly got to be at it.  I'm very drawn to that.  People that work really hard.  Right.  That are really do it.  So why do you do this show?  We're here.  We work hard.  We're here out of obligation.  Yeah.  We work hard.  Not so much artistic integrity. 
[01:01:00]  But you show up every single day.  Yeah, that's true.  And the Joan Rivers documentary was really good.  Yeah.  But I felt like she's, I don't know, like, what do you feel about that documentary?  Like she didn't...  She came across like she can't just sit down for one second and enjoy the fruits of her labor.  Enjoy what she did with her career.  Yeah, I don't know.  I never got close enough to her to see that.  But maybe she just likes that part. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, she's got gold gilded chairs and pillows and shit.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  You got to pay for all that shit.  She's got a ridiculous apartment that's, you know, she lives like a queen.  Yeah, but like from what I saw, it would be nice if she sat in that gold gilded chair every so often and relaxed.  And look what I did with my career.  It's always taking calls and this booking and...  I don't know.  Would you ever shop to do that?  I don't think I would ever...  I'd never be that one of those guys.  Not retire guy.  That's like the... 
[01:02:00]  That's the road to death is retirement.  Not if you play golf.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Got to get out there and golf?  Yeah.  That changes...  That makes it all worth it.  I love golf, so...  Really?  Yeah.  I never...  I love golf.  Oh, we just went yesterday.  I went yesterday.  Just once, we bought a big carton of balls.  Yeah.  Me and a friend of mine.  Yeah.  And we went two holes in and then there was water.  Oh, shit.  And we hit all of our balls into the water.  Like 20 balls.  And then we went home. 
[01:02:30]  That was it for you.  Yeah.  We went...  Then we took the cart back to get more balls.  Yeah.  And once we got back to the clubhouse, it's like, let's just get out of here.  Like, this is a job.  It's my fucking job all of a sudden.  Yes.  I'm like a fucking migrant worker pulling balls around the...  Like, I have to do this.  Right.  God damn.  That's so...  That's really funny.  Oh, true.  And there's always people wanting to play...  There's always upset people.  They want to play through?  They want to play through.  Yeah.  Come on!  Well, because you're not supposed to hit all your balls on one hole. 
[01:03:00]  No.  The proper thing is to...  All right.  I hit in the water.  I got to drop it.  Take a ball again.  I got to drop it somewhere around the water and move forward.  Yeah.  I know.  I hit another 20 balls.  Stand there.  I didn't know.  Golly, I'm hot today.  Yeah.  It's the only game where you get to cheat.  It's the only game where you're allowed to go, all right, well.  Yeah, look.  Just take one point off?  Yeah, yeah.  A point off and I'll...  And then you get...  I'll put the ball here.  To move on?  Yeah.  I'll put the ball here because I can't seem to get it over the water. 
[01:03:30]  It's ridiculous.  It really is something stupid.  I play with guys and they'll come up with this mulligan thing, which is not an official rule.  No.  I think we all should take a water ball mulligan.  That's not...  The PGA, you can't do that.  They made up a name for something that doesn't even exist.  I've heard hangover mulligans.  You know, we were all drinking last night, so let's do a hangover mulligan.  That's not a game, dude.  That's like in baseball.  Like, you strike out and go, I'm going to take a stashy.  And then go, what's that? 
[01:04:00]  What's that?  It's an extra strike.  No, I get a fourth strike.  I get a fourth strike.  We call it a stashy.  What?  Oh, okay.  Just make up a word and say...  Because I got jet lag, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  We had a fly-in late last night.  We're all going four.  We're going to go four strikes today for a little while.  Yeah, I can't seem to get the ball over the fence.  Louie, I need advice.  Yeah.  I love when you talk about your kids.  Yeah.  I really do.  You're a baby now, right?  14-month-old, and I'm starting to go to the playgrounds.  Yeah.  So am I.  I don't have a kid.  I've had another incident yesterday. 
[01:04:30]  I've had two major incidents.  Oh.  First of all...  What the fuck happened?  Why are you having incidents?  Well, first of all, I think all kids...  Jesus.  I think all...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought you'd be the only one.  No, what's happening to you?  I think all kids, first of all, are passive-aggressive assholes.  Yeah.  You agree with that?  Well, no, they're not.  They're just...  What?  Help me out.  They don't have the layers yet.  Yeah, but I do.  So when I see them act like that, I go, you're a passive-aggressive asshole. 
[01:05:00]  People take in each other passive-aggressively.  You're not...  The kid doesn't have any...  How about when there's a little sprinkler shooting water up, a kid will step on it and  then go, oh, if I just move my foot like this, I could spray this little baby in the  face.  And I let that shit go on, obviously.  I don't want to raise a wimp.  No, that's true.  They'll...  And then they'll run away like, I know what I just did there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's passive-aggressive.  So what happened that it was an incident?  All right, well...  Because that happens 50 times a minute.  Well...  Playground.  But my kid is really...  He's probably the smallest kid in the playground. 
[01:05:30]  I might have went to the...  14 months, yeah.  ...playground a little early.  But he's in a little puddle, because that's what you do in New York City.  You allow him to hang out in a puddle.  Yeah, in an asphalt covered with...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  Oh, it smells like shit.  We got to shower and bathe him as soon as we get home.  Yeah.  So he's got a bucket in front of him filled with water.  He's just discovering that he could fool around with a pail in water.  Yeah.  Kid comes running from easily 20 feet away.  He's about five or six.  Yeah.  And tries to kick the...  Well, he does kick the pail like it's a football. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  The pail, the water, everything goes flying into my kid.  Oh, wow.  And I jump up, and I actually said, I don't give a fuck.  This is an exact quote.  I don't give a fuck how small you are.  I will beat the shit out of you.  Really?  You said that to a kid?  See, now, I knew Louie would not be able to...  I was praying that Louie would go, yeah, I totally get it.  I lost my mind.  And then a nanny popped up. 
[01:06:30]  Because as soon as I said that, I knew there was going to be consequences.  I'm like, okay, if there's a father here, I'm fucked.  She didn't give a fuck, though, right?  She didn't care.  She actually grabbed the kid and gave him a time out.  Right.  Yeah, he shouldn't have done it.  She knew that the kid...  But then I'm standing there as all the other moms are looking at me like, wow, look at this fucking asshole, right?  But then one mom kind of nuzzles up to me and goes, I just want to tell you.  I'm glad you did that, because that kid's a real asshole.  Yeah.  He broke two of my kid's toys. 
[01:07:00]  So I guess he's already a terror.  Yeah, look, I don't think you did the kid any harm.  I'm more worried about you.  That's just...  That's something you just probably shouldn't do.  I came in and...  That just means you got to have a little more tolerance than that.  And again, not for the...  Fuck the kid.  Let him get cursed at.  I don't give a shit.  It's not going to help you with some moms.  You might get to fuck that mom later if things, you know, he knows.  Louie knows that part.  I go, the best... 
[01:07:30]  Fuck the dog in New York City.  If you're a single guy with kids, how are you not getting laid?  These moms are bored all day.  They strike up conversations with you.  I never knew...  You're also fat and ugly.  You got to be a pig sticker.  I never knew there was something going on.  Like, I assumed if you had a kid and you went to the park and you played,  like, this was a one-time deal where you would see people  and then go home and never see them again.  No, you see them all the time.  Like, you see the same people. 
[01:08:00]  See, that's something I didn't even fathom.  Oh, God.  So that these moms, you're seeing them every day and the same dumb kids,  and she's like, that kid's an asshole.  Like, you get to know the kids are idiots.  And the parents are stupid.  Yes, you get to know who the kids are.  You get to know all the people.  I don't think it's so bad that you did it in a way that you cursed out the kid.  I mean, I think kids are overprotected.  And, you know...  I'll be honest.  You've got to get some consequences.  I'll be honest.  I was out of my mind and it wasn't right.  But then I came in and I told Jimmy and Ann, I'm like,  I don't know how I'm going to do this parenting thing 
[01:08:30]  because I'm going to lose my mind to a point  I'm going to probably get the shit kicked out of me by somebody.  And it's not like I'm...  Well, look, if it happens, then that'll be a correction.  That's true.  You know what I mean?  True.  If it doesn't happen, you'll learn that that gives you power that you can wield.  You'll be fine.  I'm not being overprotective.  I'm not being overprotective.  If there's kids around his age range and he gets pushed over something,  I'm letting all that shit happen.  Absolutely.  But when it's a five or six-year-old aggressively pretty much almost kicking my kid in the head, 
[01:09:00]  I don't know how to handle that properly.  I just don't.  Yeah, no, you're learning.  You're finding out.  I pushed a kid off my son yesterday in another park.  You pushed him off physically.  Not to the point where cops need to be involved.  And then his mom comes running over, knows the kid was wrong in this instance too  because my kid is really small.  And then the kid will listen to the mom, and I go,  you better listen to her or you're going to find out the hard way. 
[01:09:30]  Was that bad?  Sometimes I've interceded with kids when their parents couldn't.  Like, you know, when you see a parent just losing with a kid,  I'll give a kid dirty looks, like kind of scare the shit out of them.  Yeah, yeah, you can really scare kids with looks.  Like when a kid's being a brat, like, no, I want it.  And the parent just doesn't have the fucking strength.  I'm sorry, honey.  We got an, I want it.  And I always stare at them.  Like I glare into their eyes and I don't look away. 
[01:10:00]  And the kid starts locking in going, why the fuck is that guy looking at me?  I just stare at them.  Like, yeah, I see what a piece of shit you are.  I see it.  Because they know.  They do know.  They know they're being assholes.  They know they're being a piece of shit.  It is a world I had no idea about, man.  I mean, your kid wanders off and starts playing with another kid.  Now, you're sort of following behind, but you're making it look like he's just on his own.  And then all of a sudden there's another parent there.  And the first question you ask is, hey, how old's your kid?  Every time.  I don't give a fuck how old that kid is. 
[01:10:30]  But all of a sudden you're doing small talk with somebody you would never talk to.  Oh, she's 17 months, but mine's 14 months.  Oh, really?  That's the whole.  Over and over and over again.  That's the conversation.  Sounds like Dollsville to me.  Oh, yeah.  And then, yeah, it's pretty boring, but.  And then either one of the kids do get.  I get the rage, though.  I get that.  That's happened to me before.  Where somebody's fucked with one of my daughters and I want to kill the kid.  Or when you just see a kid walking around with a stick.  Like slamming it into the ground. 
[01:11:00]  And you're looking at like, who the fuck is watching that kid?  He's looking for trouble.  And then you realize, oh, it's a grandparent.  Like they're out with their grandparents.  Grandparents don't do shit.  Oh, they don't have the, yeah.  One more.  The gumption.  One more and we can certainly move on.  And the other day, another kid, I had nothing to do with him.  I didn't yell at him, nothing.  Kid, he's about three, comes walking up to me, looks right at me, and hisses at me.  And runs away.  Like a cat?  And I'm like, I want to fucking kick your ass.  I'm like, why are you hissing at me? 
[01:11:30]  Because he's a dumb kid.  Kids are weird, man.  A lot of New York kids are raised in like alternative education.  And they're given a very special education led by their own curiosity.  And it turns them into really egotistical little assholes.  Little shitheads.  Yeah.  That's great.  Kids that go to public school are kind of checked by society.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they got to fit in.  They have the people that are more aggressive.  Yeah.  People that are more passive.  Yeah, it's their little society.  They figure out, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  They figure out people.  Fucking some of these kids.  Oh, they're awful.  And I've, I mean, there's a kid in my daughter's class who's not okay.  I mean, this kid's vicious.  And his mom is.  You know already, right?  Yeah.  And his mom is just, ugh.  So I'll take moments and say, you got to stop that.  I've said some pretty serious shit to that kid.  Yeah.  You got to keep your hands off my daughter.  I've said to him, wow, my daughter, like he's a grown up, like he owns a gas station or something. 
[01:12:30]  Keep your hands off my daughter.  And the kid's personality is already set.  I look around that playground.  Yeah, he's a mess.  And I already know who's going to be in prison.  You know the whole deal.  You know the sweet kids.  Yep.  The asshole, like tough guy kids.  It's good, though.  It's good to observe the people, though.  And parents.  Like, I've seen all kinds of.  There was a, well, the last place I lived before, the one I live now,  there was a park and there was a gay dad who was a really stern gay dad.  I'd never seen that before.  He was really, really gay. 
[01:13:00]  And he was like, I am going to slap you in the mouth if you don't stop.  He was really strict and tough and very gay.  Anthony, stop it.  Look at me because I'm fucking serious.  This little tiny kid.  Yeah, and how do you.  Well, his kid doesn't know.  His kid grows up with him being the tough guy, so he doesn't go, come on, dad, you're queer.  He's like, stop with that voice.  He thinks that's what an angry person sounds like. 
[01:13:30]  You're trying to be angry and trying to give me that voice, but we all hear it.  Yeah.  It's certainly a weird world.  I can't imagine.  I just do.  I'm really trying, but I don't want to talk to these fucking people.  You have to.  No, you don't really have to.  You don't?  No.  Bring a paper.  Bring your phone.  I just look at your hands and just give people one word answers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because don't they come up to you? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, they do.  Because if your kids are playing together, you're like, you know, hey, how you doing?  Huh?  Didn't you?  Did you come here yesterday?  Yep.  And then you turn your fucking face away from their face.  And you feel them.  You sort of, in your peripheral vision, you see them going, ugh.  What an asshole.  And then walking away, and that's the end of that person in your life.  I do it all the time.  That's so hard to do.  It's hard to be an asshole.  Really?  It's very hard to be an asshole without this microphone in front of me. 
[01:14:30]  No, man.  Like, out in public, I really, I kind of want to be liked, and I'll be overly, like, if  somebody's talking to me, I will, in my head, I'll be going, shut the fuck up.  I'll literally, sometimes I even mouth it like a ventriloquist.  I'm pretty good at, like, I could smile and be like, why don't you shut the fuck up?  Just shut, shut the fuck up.  I don't get a shit.  I don't get a shit.  And they're just talking. 
[01:15:00]  You have a hard time just saying it.  So I can't, like, but I'll be like, yeah, yeah, nod my head, and they'll keep going.  Like, I'd love to be able to go, yup, nope.  I tend to do that now.  I didn't used to, but I do that now.  Yeah, and sometimes if I take my kids to Central Park, there'll be people there with  their kids.  There's certain areas, like, there's these waterfalls, and your kids can play and hear  them, and somebody will have kids, and they'll recognize me, and they're, me and my kids  and their kids are playing.  Oh, now they're, hey, you're on TV, and I'm like, yep, okay, girls, let's go home. 
[01:15:30]  It's the end of that.  You know, I saw that Louie guy.  I'm not going to stay here and talk to this guy.  I don't care how much you're bonding with that kid.  I don't care how nurturing that is.  That Louie guy from TV, what an asshole.  I saw him in the park, and our kids were, like, playing and shit, and he just was a fucking  asshole.  All I did was say, hey, I saw your show.  His show's not even that good.  I was being nice.  But that guy's dreaming, like, oh, our kids are getting along.  We're going to have play dates. 
[01:16:00]  We're going to go to Louie's house.  Nope, nope, sorry.  Hey, we've got a therapist on the line really quickly.  Steve calls the show from time to time.  Steve, Connecticut, go.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Opie, I think you're 100% right on the money with what you did.  We're living in a world that's a moral never-never land, and kids don't get consequences because  everybody's afraid of being politically incorrect.  I think you did exactly the right things.  Well, I'm worried because I know I'm going to go too far, and then I'm going to get the 
[01:16:30]  shit kicked out of me.  Well, I know there's, it's a, you know, it takes a village thing.  Those kids don't just need their parents.  They need other people.  They need to find out from other people that you can't fuck around.  Right.  You're going to get a reaction.  The thing is, this is your kid.  If you're not going to protect them, who will?  So I say you're right on the mark.  Oh, really?  I'm telling your kid I'll beat the shit out of you.  He was five.  You're a therapist.  You don't need, the language is for you.  You don't need the language. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  The kid's going to not, he's not going to be particularly impressed.  All I would say is, fuck is wasted there.  And it's only going to, you know, it's only going to bum people out in a way that you  don't need.  Yeah.  If you say to a kid, I don't care how little you are, I'm going to kick your ass or whatever,  I will hurt you.  If you say it perfectly cleanly, it's actually worse for the kid.  Yeah.  I'm going to try that next time.  Because it sounds real.  I'm going to try it next time.  Are you?  Or I'm going to stay away from playgrounds for a while. 
[01:17:30]  You're playing parental Russian roulette.  I know.  Because you've pulled it off a few times.  I know.  You've clicked on an empty chamber.  But one of these days, a parent is really going to get mad.  Maybe the mother will be there and the father, and then the father will come over.  And now you've got that confrontation.  I don't think that's going to happen.  One that usually a girlfriend would get you into.  Right.  You know?  Yes.  A girlfriend who doesn't get.  Saying shit.  I've told that story in a fucking movie theater once.  And there was a row of Hispanic, a whole family behind us. 
[01:18:00]  And just in front of us, just yapping, yapping, yapping.  Wouldn't stop.  And my girl went from zero to a hundred.  Just went, would you shut the fuck up?  That's crazy.  And then it's like, oh, no, you didn't say that to me.  I was going, you'll fuck you.  And the guy that was with her, he turned to me and goes, oh, well, she put her in battle mode.  Battle mode.  And I'm just like, great. 
[01:18:30]  Now I've got to defuse this.  Because I can't fight my way out of this.  I had to defuse it.  She's fucking with your dick.  She's like.  Yes.  She's fucking with my dick.  Yep.  And we actually wound up having to get up and go into a different theater to watch the movie.  Because there was a threat of physical harm to her.  And then I can't just sit there as she's getting her face pummeled.  So I got to jump in, which means the guy's got to jump in.  Yeah.  And now there's a big brouhaha. 
[01:19:00]  And I don't need that.  But what I'm seeing is something that's very similar.  You could get yourself into that type of brawl situation.  I'm fully aware.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  You know the thing.  I know I'm an idiot.  And I got to figure this shit out.  Because it's going to get bad.  The thing that people seem to forget is that it's not okay ever to hit anybody, though.  Even if you yell at somebody.  If somebody yelled at your kid.  Right.  Somebody called your girlfriend a cunt in public. 
[01:19:30]  You're still not allowed to hit them.  But a lot of people do.  Especially like, yeah.  If you yell at a kid.  It's like whenever there's cops on a scene.  Whenever there's a fight and cops show up.  Yeah.  They always remind everybody of shit.  That, like, well, he said the thing.  It doesn't matter.  The cop has to say, like.  You're not allowed to hit a person.  You hit him because he said something.  No, no matter what he said.  You may not raise your fucking hand to another human being. 
[01:20:00]  Unless they were doing it to you.  That's the only reason you're allowed to.  Right.  And you have self-control like that?  Yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't hit anybody if they said something.  It's unacceptable to hit somebody because of verbs that came out of their mouth.  There's no, it's absolutely, it's amoral.  I will hit a father.  Now, what happens, though, in a situation where you're facing off?  Like, there's a point where you go, there's a fight going to start.  And it's probably best I get the first fucking lick in, you know? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, for self-defense.  That's the only reason it's okay to hit anybody.  Yeah, okay.  Is to protect yourself.  Not because you're angry, because they said some shit.  What are you, fucking four?  You're not allowed to do that.  I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I'm surprised they don't like fights they hurt.  Because you don't like what they said?  Yeah.  I don't like that, and so I get to fucking injure your body?  That's ridiculous.  Roll up my hand into something hard.  Yeah, and punch you in the fucking eye and maybe blind you?  And thrust it into your eyeball?  Because I didn't like what came out of your mouth. 
[01:21:00]  And fucking introduce a random, violent energy that could end with somebody dying.  Right.  You never know.  Every time you're in a fight, you've rolled the dice.  Something really fucked up could happen.  There's been people that have punched people and they fall, bang their head, and they're  dead.  Some guy's in prison going, I just went to clock him in the face like I do all the time.  Because his kid was an asshole.  Yeah, he said something a little untoward.  And now you're fucking, you're shackled at the ankles.  I wasn't pleased with the things he said.  So now I'm in prison for the rest of my life and he's blind. 
[01:21:30]  And we met and cried.  There was a whole reunion.  Yeah, yeah.  We made up.  But then I still have to go back to my cell.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in prison.  That sucks.  No, it's not okay.  I gotta work on it.  Oh, Opie.  The other thing is because he's so young and has just complete incidents still.  Yeah.  Like, seeing, like, I see it, but he doesn't see it yet.  Disappointment?  Yeah.  How did he deal with that?  Tell him to get the fuck used to that shit.  That's brutal.  There, you gotta let him, you mean for him being disappointed? 
[01:22:00]  He's not disappointed yet, but I, like all of a sudden he'll innocently go up to another  kid to try to play or like hand him one of his toys and the kid will either completely  ignore him or rip the toy out of his hand and run away.  And my fucking heart breaks.  Yeah, yours is breaking.  Oh, I know he doesn't understand that yet.  It's not that he doesn't understand, it's that he's okay.  I mean, I, this is something I learned from my first daughter.  Yeah.  Was to, how to have any positive outlook on life at all.  Like, I learned it from her. 
[01:22:30]  Like, I let her lead me out of the wilderness of that.  Because I've, to me, it's like, as soon as she was born, my first thought was, when  is she going to realize that this is, this is, life is torture.  Like, when is it going to hit her?  When does it hit?  Because she looks so happy and she, you know, I thought, because I always, I always used  to think about birth as this awful, you know, you were in a, in a womb and it was warm.  You were just, your body was filled with fluid, warm fluid.  Like, there was no, no conflict.  Like being in the matrix. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Taking a breath is an immediate, like it's an invasion.  Yeah.  You can feel your body attack, whatever came in that shouldn't have.  The air is a little cold.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, that's the way I look at life as a struggle.  Just even just being alive.  Right from the get go.  Yeah.  So I figured a kid is born and then they're like, just irritated and angry, but she was  so positive.  She was so happy to be alive.  And so I realized to her, somebody taking, you know, her reaching out to somebody and 
[01:23:30]  them walking away.  She's like, well, somebody, you know, something else will happen.  I can do this by myself.  Your kid isn't stupid.  Your kid is just looking at life from positive.  Your kid's not like, oh fuck, that kid walked away from me.  Because that's what you see.  That's what you feel.  That's what I'm seeing actually.  Yeah, but you let the kid, follow the kid's example.  A baby's a perfect person in a way.  They like, they're like an animal.  They're like, you can learn what human beings really like from babies. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  Because you're seeing a human instinct without any of the.  Without any.  Bullshit.  Shit that's been pumped in from.  Yeah.  Other people.  It's like babies' diets are perfect.  They, because they just eat what they need.  So all of a sudden your baby will only eat carrots for like a month.  Well, well, it's beta carotene deficiency.  Just needs that.  Yeah.  Your baby's not like, oh, I can't stop fucking eating carrots.  Your baby just wants that thing for a while.  And they'll stay away from the grains you give them or whatever. 
[01:24:30]  You know.  I'm fucking learning some stuff today.  This is, this to me, though, sounds like, like, like parenthood is a fucking nightmare.  I don't see.  It's great.  No, it sounds like it's just years of this emotional roller coaster that, that a human  shouldn't have to go through.  It is.  It's just.  But the attachment you have, it's hard to explain.  It is great.  I'm with Louie.  I'm all in.  I love it.  But, you know, I'm trying to. 
[01:25:00]  Well, yeah, I'm trying to learn my way around it.  Well, that's so as long as you're doing that, you're fine.  As long as you're actually trying to learn and not take trying to hold on to what you  were like before.  Oh, no, that's it.  Just say goodbye.  Oh, yeah.  But that's.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of that is positive.  You get rid of shit that you've because your life becomes just a series of cravings and  death disappointments and gray versions of shit that you thought you were going to get.  But if you give up on all the things you thought you used to want, you start getting new shit 
[01:25:30]  from it.  A lot of that stuff has already left me.  Absolutely.  I got I got some things I got to figure out, like how to not curse at little kids and things  like that.  Right.  But in general, my life is drastically different.  The fact that you leave that situation introspective and asking questions from people you know means  that you're doing fine.  Yeah.  If you were just such fucking kid and I should fuck you and his mom looked at me, I was  like, fuck her.  And then if you just stayed that way, you know, people, you can just see that guy's not thinking  about what he's doing. 
[01:26:00]  He's not even gaining from the guy.  This might be impossible for you guys to even consider because you're so emotionally attached  to your children.  But this is a hassle to you.  I understand.  But but are there things that you absolutely can't do now that you would love to be able  to do, but you have kids like I understand the part, the great part is having the kid  and and there's that all that love stuff and everything.  Yeah.  But like that aside, I don't even know if you could put that aside, but if you could put 
[01:26:30]  that personal thing that that you're in love with this little human being, are there things  that you're like, fuck, man, I really want to do that.  Um, well, yeah, but some of them, uh, die down.  Yeah.  After a while.  And you can do a lot.  I can't think of anything I really can't do that I want to do.  I mean, I wouldn't mind moving to another town.  Sometimes I think about that.  Yeah.  Like at this point in my life, what if I could move to San Francisco or Philadelphia for,  you know, or Canada or some shit? 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  I can't really do it because I got to maintain my kid's life.  So there's a stability that I got to maintain.  Yeah.  It seems to me that I can't walk away from, but still, I mean, I, to me, the best thing  in the world is to have kids and then get divorced because you really can do anything you want.  Cause it's more of the wife that would hold you back.  That's exactly right.  I have my kids half the week.  And even if you get along with your wife, you still, you have a, you have to make bargains  and compromises with pretty much every moment of your life. 
[01:27:30]  Especially once, once there's a kid, you, you start, um, you got to share that responsibility.  So you start every moment.  It's like, where are you going?  If you start leaving the house, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?  Cause I would like to get the fuck out of here.  So where are you going right now?  We better be, well, I'm just going to walk around.  No, not good enough.  You're sitting here cause I'd like to walk around.  So neither of us is going to get to walk around.  So we'll just be miserable.  We're just going to sit here with the fucking baby till one of us has like an emergency reason 
[01:28:00]  to get out of here.  That's what it starts to be.  We, uh, we take turns.  It's horrible.  We don't spend as much time as we used to together.  Cause we're taking turns cause we don't have a lot of help.  It's really smart to do that, to take turns.  But we take turns.  Like, cause you just made a great point.  Why are we both sitting here?  One of us could watch the kid.  You know, I, I do a lot of quality things with my son.  So now I'm going to go to the gym.  Yeah.  Uh, she has her thing.  She wants to do and we kind of take turns, but unfortunately that means we're not together  as much as probably we would like. 
[01:28:30]  Wow.  But we understand that.  It's great that you're doing that.  And let one person, if one person's awake, the other person should fucking be sleeping.  Yes.  So that they'll be useful when the other person finally taps out.  It's just the dumbest thing in the world.  It's like having a, you're, if you're driving a car and then you go just turn the other one  on and then in the garage and let it run while you're driving one car.  Makes no sense.  Why would you do that?  Well, cause the car that's driving is like, no, if I, if I'm out here dragging people 
[01:29:00]  and groceries around, you're going to at least be running a piece of shit.  Like if your cars were married to each other, a lot of parents make that mistake where they  put the kid in the room or whatever and they both have to stay awake all night.  He's making an amazing point.  If you, you guys have a good relationship then.  Cause the only reason to share that shit is cause you don't like each other.  Right.  Cause you want to put each other through shit.  Right.  Some, some hell.  No, that's the best is when you can, you can do that.  And you're doing the right thing by spending a lot of time with your kid.  Cause you start getting, it's like the thing you're dismissing in the first sentence. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  I get the love, but that's the big part.  That's the huge part.  It's like saying, uh, look, I get that you like living blah, blah, blah.  And but why not kill yourself?  I mean, granted life is worth living.  Death is terrifying, but still, why don't you just die?  But there is, there is a sacrifice that's being made by, by having children.  You're, I don't, I don't know whether it's that important, uh, of a sacrifice or whether 
[01:30:00]  the child is such a great thing that, that the sacrifice isn't even a sacrifice.  Well, if for dads, it's the thing that you don't know automatically is that you should  be with the kids.  Right.  Uh, yeah.  So I always, I kind of had this instinct, be with the kids a lot.  But, and then it's not a sacrifice.  Like the shit you have to, the fucking shit you have to do, the amount of errands you have  to run and, uh, shit you have to go, the logistics of keeping food and supplies in the house.  Well, the thing I started doing is just always bring the kid with you. 
[01:30:30]  Always, I'll take him, and then the mom is like, fuck, great.  Because your kid is great company.  They're great.  They're really fun to be with.  If you go out, I used to love going out shopping for 50 things as long as I had my daughter  with me.  She's just somebody to talk to.  Right.  And you see the world through their eyes.  Yeah, you get to show your kid every, like I used to go to the supermarket, which I used  to hate doing, but I'm like, oh, I take a watermelon off the shelf and put it in her 
[01:31:00]  lap.  Look at this.  It's a fucking watermelon.  You've never seen one of those before, have you?  And she's got this green, she's never seen a watermelon.  I handed her her first watermelon and watched her look at it and go, Jesus.  That's amazing.  And she just held it in her lap.  I see Travis laughing his ass off too, because Travis is a new dad.  We're relatively new, you know, a two-year-old.  Two-year-old.  Yeah, that's right.  I see Travis gets this too.  I always gave my daughter access to the real world.  I don't believe in, like toys are shit. 
[01:31:30]  Toys are like fake things.  But a watermelon is like, holy shit, that's a watermelon.  Or just give her your computer.  Just here, take this.  Just give her fucking movie cameras and shit to just hold.  See, whenever I see kids doing that, all I can think of is, is she going to break it?  They might.  I'm going to fuck it up.  They might.  I might break it.  I don't care.  I don't take care of my shit anyway.  Following your logic, you don't have a connection to the kids, so it's hard to explain.  Right.  Like you just see like other people's kids. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  And you're like, why would you do that?  But as soon as your son is born, your life changes fucking instantly.  And it's hard to explain to anyone.  And then maybe some of the stuff you miss, like we used to go down to the Caribbean every year.  This year we didn't go.  Yeah.  I miss it, yes.  But like Louie says, it's sort of pushed down, though.  I'm not craving it like, fuck, I can't believe we didn't go this year.  It's okay.  Yeah.  And it's just okay.  See, that's what I was, that was my point.  Like, that's okay.  Yeah, but we're going to go next year and I'm going to bring the kid and I know we're going 
[01:32:30]  to have a great time.  Everything they do that fucks with you is positive in the end.  Like, my kids, when they'd wake me up at six and I went to sleep at three because I'm  a night person, they'd wake me up and the feeling in my brain would hurt a lot.  Like, I don't want to fucking be up right now.  But within 10 minutes, we're talking.  I'm talking to them.  And they're in the morning, they're just, they got a good attitude in the morning.  I've got one eye open and I'm going, yeah, what?  Daddy, I had a dream.  Okay, what? 
[01:33:00]  And I'm just listening to it.  And then I'm like, wow, you had that dream?  That is, you know, then you're getting into conversation with your kid and they're nice  to you.  You know?  I mean, some people have a contrary relationship with their kids.  Yeah.  And they are always, you know, dad!  Like, those kind of kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking, I would tap right out of that life.  I'd fucking dye my hair and get the fuck out.  I wouldn't be able to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Both of my girls and I have really good, really, and the little one and I, we fight sometimes 
[01:33:30]  and it's contentious, but it never feels like a bad, it's fun.  It's also, when your kid is being an asshole, it feels good to know you're there to correct  it and to say, no, you're not, like, when I lock horns with my daughter, she wants something  and I'm not going to give it to her and she's crying, I feel great.  Really?  Yeah.  I feel great that I'm there showing her.  Yeah, you don't get to have it. 
[01:34:00]  Why?  There's not a good reason.  You just don't.  You just don't.  Because I said so.  You just don't.  And there's no embarrassment in public places with temper tantrums and stuff.  Couldn't care less.  You couldn't care less.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to give a fuck either.  I don't care.  Because I hate that.  I look around and when kids are being, like, loud and stuff, I don't mind in, well, I  do mind all the time, but there are certain places I understand, like, all right, I'm  in a mall.  There's a kid, he doesn't want to be here, he's going to be yelling and screaming. 
[01:34:30]  I could get away from the situation.  But there are other places, movie theaters, things where I'm like, shut that fucking kid  up or take him the fuck out of the movie.  You're missing the movie.  Take your kid out, pick him up, go out to the lobby and fix that problem.  Your kid is the same, I mean, the kid, I always, though, also remember that your kid is a  citizen of the country, too.  Your kid has rights.  Like, I go crazy when people, like, fucking knee my kid in the face because they're not  looking.  Holy shit. 
[01:35:00]  You know, they don't give a shit.  And it's like, my kid has fucking rights, you know?  Yeah.  So to me, it's like, your kid, the kid who's yelling in a movie theater is no different  than the fucking dirty Hispanics you were talking about.  Well, it's the same thing.  No, they're just being loud assholes.  The kid is, yeah.  Don't you think you can avoid some of that stuff by raising them properly, though?  I know you're not going to be perfect, but I don't think my kid's going to be acting  up in public if I raise them properly.  No, my kids wouldn't do that.  You can tell when you look at the parent that they're weak. 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  And that they don't do it at home.  They don't try.  They get underwater with it.  They're allowing too much.  Yeah.  Not too much.  No, my kids don't.  They don't make a scene.  They generally don't.  And also, the other thing is, people get too bent on getting through their day the way  they planned it.  So when your kid explodes and you're trying to push through the day, I cancel everything.  Yeah.  If we're getting into a hairy thing with one of the kids, I just put everything down on  the sidewalk and sit on the sidewalk and go, we're not going now. 
[01:36:00]  See, you have this very unique.  Let's talk about this.  That's because I'm not married.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I get to do that.  Wow.  If you're married, you've got to fucking plan everything.  And this is, again, if you're getting along.  This is in a bad marriage.  Right.  You have to plan everything.  You have to agree on every fucking detail of how something's going to go down.  And you have to stick to your plans.  That's a nightmare.  I took my kids camping a couple weeks ago. 
[01:36:30]  And the reason it worked is because I was able to do it myself and I had the power to  pull the plug on the whole thing.  You did your way.  Yeah.  I said, let's just get in the car and just go south.  And I went to a sporting goods store with the girls and I'm buying a tent and sleeping  bags and they're like, are we going camping?  I was like, we might.  I said, I don't know yet.  I haven't decided if this is going to happen.  We're going to buy these things.  We may or may not use them.  So we put all this shit in the trunk, the camping stuff, and we drove. 
[01:37:00]  In my head, I was like, I didn't have a place to stop.  I didn't use a map.  I just fucking drove down the Jersey Shore and we saw a hotel.  So let's, oh, let's stay there tonight.  Stay in a hotel.  Next day, I always had the option to just run back home.  It's like you're on the lam.  Yeah, exactly.  Found a ferry that goes to Delaware from New Jersey in Cape May and this beautiful ferry  boat.  Just found it.  Went to Cape May.  I'm all about that.  Oh, I don't like a plan. 
[01:37:30]  No, it was so good.  I just want to jump in the car and go sometimes.  And the kids don't know and they don't give a shit.  And then there's a state park.  I see a sign for a state park and I go, hey, do you want to go camping and sleep in a tent  tonight?  And they're like, yeah.  And so I pull over.  But again, as I'm putting them, I didn't never looked at the instructions.  I opened the tent at the campsite.  Yeah.  And as I start building it in my head, I'm like, if this gets gnarly, there's a fucking  hotel 10 minutes from here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just go to the hotel. 
[01:38:00]  Kept it.  Yeah.  But we did it.  We spent the night in a fucking in the middle of the wilderness.  Yeah.  A six and a nine year old.  And there's a well with a pump and they were making, they were cleaning and making.  We made dinner.  It was fucking amazing.  It was one of the greatest nights I ever spent on earth.  It's the best way to do things.  I was recently in Philly for a birthday party and we had to go all the way up to Rochester  to hang out, you know, at Brother Weasel's place.  He has a place, a cottage on the bay.  So we're leaving and my wife goes, where are we staying tonight? 
[01:38:30]  And we were leaving at 830 at night.  I go, I don't know yet, but I'll figure it out.  And to me, that was really exciting.  Yeah.  I know there's a million motels out there.  We're not going to sleep in our car.  No.  But I don't know where we're sleeping yet.  No.  I don't know how many hours I want to drive.  We might drive all the way.  Yep.  I might get a cup of coffee and just make it all the way to Rochester.  Or we might stop in an hour because I'm like, fuck this.  Or maybe three hours.  It's the best.  And it's freeing.  See that?  It is.  It's great.  I mean, that's what with my girls, I called it a road trip. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  We said, we're on the road.  We're not going.  Where are we going?  I don't know.  Yeah.  No real business.  We just went on a road trip.  And because they don't, they're not fucking nosy grownups.  They don't have to know.  Well, how far is it?  Where are we going?  Can you just find out?  Can you call?  They're just in the back seat reading and having a good time.  And then once in a while, I'd stop and go, get out here.  What is this?  It's a national preserve.  Look at the birds.  They're like, wow.  And then we're camping.  We fucking camp.  We wake up.  We break camp. 
[01:39:30]  And then next thing you know, they know they're in Washington, D.C.  They had no idea how close they were.  I'm like, this is the nation's capital.  Look at Abraham Lincoln.  They're like, oh, my God.  And I wrote my manager right before I left because I thought I might be in D.C.  to say, do you know anybody at the White House?  It's like, do I have any connection to the White House?  But they didn't know this.  If I had a wife, I think I might be able to.  Do you really know anybody?  Did you get us the thing at the White House?  But that morning I woke up.  The morning we got to D.C.  And they said, we got you a tour with one of Obama's speechwriters. 
[01:40:00]  He wants to get into comedy.  Oh, shit.  So you had to listen to it.  Yeah, so I just take my daughters to the White House.  They have no idea.  Just come on.  Just come over here.  And we go up to the gate.  And I tell my name.  And they open the gate to the fucking White House.  And we walked in and had a personal tour by this dude.  And looking at it from a kid's perspective,  that's way better.  It's a great day.  Because they have no idea what's going to happen.  But they also don't have an idea that that is an amazing dad right there. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  That is like a super dad.  Just took him camping, the White House, friggin' hand pump.  That's great shit.  It was insane.  That's not like, you know, oh, fuck.  All right, let's go, you know.  Let's go to the mall.  Buy some shoes.  Well, Louie's teaching it.  It's not like everything has to be planned and stuff.  Yeah.  You could just go with it.  Even though, like in my case, it's a 14-month-old.  You would think maybe we should have a planned fucking hotel set up. 
[01:41:00]  And that's the thing I always thought, like, okay, and from hearing,  spontaneity, like, disappears when you have kids.  But you just, like, that to me is the ultimate in spontaneity.  You can do it.  And they don't know how, I mean, I'm sort of looking ahead a day,  and I'm looking at possibilities.  You know, I'm using my iPhone and finding shit.  Sure.  But if the White House thing had fallen through,  they never would have known it was even on tap.  Yeah, right.  No disappointment.  No.  You just do, oh, okay, we got this. 
[01:41:30]  Come on over here.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  You could have gone to the park across the street.  Yeah.  And look at homeless people, and that would have been cool, too.  And then at the end of the whole trip, we had to drive home.  So it was like a five-hour drive.  Yeah, that's correct.  And I told them, you're going to pay for the trip now.  It's five hours of driving through fucking New Jersey.  It's not going to be in Delaware.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're like, oh, okay.  That's payment.  Yeah, it's worth it.  Yeah.  It's worth it.  That's something, man.  I don't think being a parent has to be a major sacrifice.  You're certainly making sacrifices, but it doesn't have to be so drastic. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, you take your kids to what you do.  I mean, as their lives get more involved, you have to start.  In New York, it's hard because you have to manage all their lives.  Yeah.  You have to go to all their shit.  You have to arrange all their shit.  You can't let them outside, eh?  It's a lot, but it becomes a traffic.  It becomes a traffic jam in your head that you just learn to...  It just becomes second nature.  See, I like sleep. 
[01:42:30]  See?  And that's something you don't seem to get a lot of, I noticed, when you talk to parents.  I like guns.  Guns and children.  Ah!  They're really going together that well.  Anytime you hear about that combination, it's never good.  I like drinking a lot.  Yeah.  That seems to be a bad thing around kids.  Yeah, you can't have, like, the Martin Sheen in the hotel room nights.  Right, right, right.  When you have a kid, you can't...  But I'm thinking, like...  Somebody will call you, how are you? 
[01:43:00]  And you're like, oh, fine.  And they don't know that it's been, like, 72 hours.  Yeah, benders.  Just the total...  Benders are out.  Yeah, they're gone.  No more benders.  Well, Kenny told me once that he used to like to drink a lot.  Club Soda Kenny.  He had his pops, you know?  Yeah.  I go, why'd you stop drinking?  He goes, because kids don't understand hangovers.  Yeah.  So that was his thing.  He's like, fuck this.  I'm not going to wake up after drinking all night, three hours sleep.  Like, if a kid tries to pound you on the head and wake you up at six in the morning when 
[01:43:30]  you have a raging hangover and want to sleep till noon, there's a problem.  But see, I would consider that an upgrade to your life, though.  Right, right.  To me, that's...  Look, I'm not saying...  I would look at that as an improvement.  Fuck that.  I'm sacrificing a hangover for a kid.  Fuck that.  Suddenly, you're getting up at six with a clear head.  And actually, greeting your kid with breakfast when they wake up, you're actually a better  human being now.  I do understand where that's coming from.  I'm not trying to sell the hangover part as one of the sacrifices. 
[01:44:00]  You really got to get rid of selfishness.  Yeah, but again, have kids and then get divorced, because I get both.  Okay, yes.  I mean, my kids are with me half the week, three and a half days, and it's not...  So I'm not visiting with them.  I'm really raising them.  But I get a whole half of the fucking every week that I'm just a grown-up.  You're dating, you know, with dating and stuff.  I do whatever I want.  Yeah.  So that's not an issue.  When I'm with the kids, that's time to be with the kids.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  And also, I'm a better father, because when I'm with the kids, I put everything else  aside.  I don't have to juggle kids.  And I'm also self-employed, and what I do, I can control when I work.  Even on my show, when we're in production, we only shoot half a week.  Oh, really?  I don't work.  You don't do the whole week.  That's one of the reasons I did the show the way I did, because I don't want to have  to work five days a week.  So they're five days a week.  Yeah.  Because I don't have a wife at home.  So if my kids are at my place, and I'm working, they're like, why do I have custody of my 
[01:45:00]  kids just so they can be with some lady I can fucking hire?  It's pointless.  Yeah.  It'd be better if they were there with their mom.  But because I control my show, we shoot half the week, and then when I don't have the  kids, I work like 14-hour days.  And then when I do have them, I just fucking, it's just me and them.  Hey, John from Allentown says enough with the kids talk, so we better stop, because John's  not into it.  Go fuck yourself.  No, no, that guy's John from Allentown.  What are you, nuts?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, John. 
[01:45:30]  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, enough with the kids talk, man.  I got a four-year-old and stuff, but it's boring already.  I don't think it's boring.  Oh, well.  It's boring to you, and that's fair enough, but.  You gotta explain things to people.  Like, this is a whole take between two guys.  A very different take.  Varying parents.  One guy that doesn't have kids and can't even fucking understand it.  That's what I mean.  We're conversing as human beings, you tool.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  It really got under your skin.  I'd like to punch him for saying that. 
[01:46:00]  There was a guy, he couldn't hang around, 15 days in jail, because he got in a fight  with a father.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  And another guy detained for two hours for telling a kid that he was going to knock him  out.  Do you want to talk to Mike?  A threat of violence.  Mikey.  Yeah.  Could be a problem.  I've brought this up probably three or four times already on the show, because I am deeply  concerned in my own brain that I've got to figure this out sooner than later.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, man.  It was the 4th of July, and I took my wife and two kids to a fair. 
[01:46:30]  And there was a line of kids, and these older kids kept knocking them down.  So I just walked over, and I leaned into one of the older kids that was knocking kids down,  and I said, hey.  I leaned in, thank God.  And I said, hey, you knock another kid down, I'm going to knock you the fuck out.  Mm-hmm.  Good for you.  Well, yeah.  What happened, though?  20 minutes later, I'm taking one of my kids to the bathroom. 
[01:47:00]  Two cops come out of nowhere.  Oh, boy.  They pull me aside.  My whole family had to stay there for two hours, and I started losing my mind.  Thank God my buddy was there, who's a lawyer.  And thank God I denied it from the beginning to the end, saying I never said anything.  And I kept saying to the cops, let me ask you something.  Fifteen-year-olds are here at the fair.  I'm here.  I'm a 40-year-old guy at the fair with my family.  Who do you think came here to cause trouble? 
[01:47:30]  Nope.  They kept me for two hours, man.  They wrote me up.  I have, like, whatever kind of record now.  Oh, wow, man.  When I was a kid, if my kid came to me and said, hey, some old guy threatened me, I would have gotten slapped, and my father would have said, what did you do?  What did you do?  Times have changed.  He's right about that.  Maybe for the better.  He's right.  Why did you do that?  Stop being an asshole.  No, he's right, though.  I mean, that's... 
[01:48:00]  He has a right to say that.  The kid you said it to was 15?  Yeah, I don't know.  But they were, like, early teens.  Yeah, fuck that.  Yeah, fuck that.  Yeah, that's right.  If you're a teenager, you're a fucking grown-up.  Yeah, yeah.  This isn't suburbia, guys.  This is...  I'm in suburbia, New York, upscale area.  The kid went and told his dad some guy threatened me, and it was a nightmare, man.  You know the thing about that?  The dad should have confronted you.  Boys that are bullies are fucking pussies.  That's the worst part.  And I've seen that many times. 
[01:48:30]  If you go up to a boy who's being a little, vicious bully, and you say, cut the shit, or  you're sharp with him, they just turn into little babies.  They are the most fragile little fucking pussies.  Really?  All bullies are.  That's one thing that's great about being on the play yard and being with kids is you  find out about people that way.  Like, you see little bullies, and you see that energy, that aggressive energy, but you  realize that right next to it is just a little fucking pissy pants... 
[01:49:00]  What makes that?  Loser little fucking kid.  What kind of parenting makes a bully, by the way?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  You haven't seen enough of that?  I don't know how it happens.  Well, they just turn into fucking...  I don't know how it all happens either.  Because I've seen it in school and stuff, and it goes through life.  Yeah, it's not economic.  It's not...  You have a 70-year-old fucking asshole bully.  So it just happens.  I got a real good question coming in for Anne.  Eric and boss, I don't have time to go to the phone right now. 
[01:49:30]  When did you realize you didn't want kids?  And let me answer the question.  I always knew I wanted kids.  I was just in horrible relationships and knew I wasn't going to be stupid and have kids  with someone I wasn't sure about.  I don't know if my parents fucked me up about having kids, because it was just...  Oh, God.  It was just a nightmare being like a kid and all that fucking bullshit going on.  The constant yelling.  Well, you had a bad...  You had a bad... 
[01:50:00]  Oh, it was awful.  You had a bad family, right?  Oh, it was terrible.  Just yelling constantly.  Just, son of a bitch.  Fuck you, Joey, you fucking ass.  Fuck you, Rose.  And I'm like, I'm just crying in the middle.  Shut the fuck up.  I'll give you something to cry about.  It was just constant turmoil.  And then me and my brother, just two kids trying to talk.  And, you know, we had bunk beds.  And we'd go to bed.  We'd have our bedtime.  It's like 7.30. 
[01:50:30]  And Joe's was like 8 or something like that.  And then by 8 o'clock, we'd start talking.  And then I'd hear, I want to hear another word in there.  It's like we couldn't talk.  That's all you had was that little time to talk.  Yes, just to chat.  But, and then he would come in and my father would put his belt on the doorknob and be  like, don't make me use this.  And the glistening buckle swinging back and forth.  I'm just looking like, oh, we can't talk.  It's lights out, motherfuckers.  Well, so you had this bad, you have this bad association with having a family. 
[01:51:00]  Horrible one.  And now you're in your own, like, this is like your whole life was defined by it because  you, now you have your own home.  Yeah.  You have fucking guns.  And, you know, porn at your fingertips.  Right.  A nice big air conditioned car.  Oh, fantastic.  And you don't want to fuck with that.  Right.  I totally get it.  I don't want to fuck with it.  I totally get it.  But can I add this to the equation?  Yeah.  You're really close with your family.  I am very close with my family.  But you're really close with your mom, your brother, and your sister.  Yeah.  You guys get together a lot. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, but who wants to make that investment all over again?  I mean, it wasn't worth it, was it?  And my brother and sister have kids.  So it's like they got one, you know, one each.  Not together.  That would be weird.  But I like when they come over, like yesterday, my brother, and he brought little Layla over.  And, you know, they went in the pool and everything.  And she loves the water.  And cute as a button.  And it's great.  And then, yeah, they pick up and go.  And while they're there, I'm not like, fucking kids, son of a bitch. 
[01:52:00]  Like, I'm making faces and googie faces and having fun.  Do you get excited to see them?  Yeah, it's cool.  Like, I enjoy when the kids are around.  But, like, then I'll just have a debaucherous party at the house.  And, you know, thank God there are no kids around.  Well, there are kids, but they're the ones you're fucking.  Well, that's, how do you define kid?  But that is the true question.  Let me get these kids out of here so I can bring those kids over.  Bring the other kids over. 
[01:52:30]  Let me go to Coke Logic from Chicago.  Coke, what's up, brother?  Hey, oh, you just took the call about the guy threatening the teenagers for picking on his kid.  You kind of let slide that you revealed earlier that you threatened a one-year-old.  No, it wasn't a one.  It was like a four or five-year-old, probably.  Oh, yeah, no, that guy.  And I'm saying I was wrong, Coke Logic.  I know I'm wrong.  But if it's a 15-year-old, fuck the 15-year-old. 
[01:53:00]  I'll curse him out, no problem.  You know what you find out, too, is that parents, you know, like the thing that it takes a village.  I think it's actually, it's that it takes a village to keep, to support each other, the parents.  It's not about helping the kids.  It's not about the kid learns how to weave from this one parent and then learns how to throw a pot in this other house.  It's that when the mom wants to kill her fucking kid, the village comes over, gives her a shot of whiskey and tells her, just don't, just take a breath. 
[01:53:30]  I know how you feel.  Yes, he's an asshole.  Your husband's a piece of shit or whatever it is.  So, when you're going to have more moments like that, and every time it happens, someone, a parent's going to come up to you like that woman did.  That's really the significant thing that happened, is that someone else came up and said, look, that was inappropriate of you, and I give you license to have done it.  Right.  Because that kid's an asshole.  Yeah, and he is an asshole.  Everyone's going, you're going to fuck up over and over again. 
[01:54:00]  You shouldn't have done that, but you're going to shouldn't have done that over and over again.  A bunch of times.  And other parents, they're there for you.  I've seen that a few times, like a parent melts down, loses it, and everybody else just sort of steps in, picks up the fucking shit the kid dropped, and just helps, puts the parent back together, gets her through the line.  I've been in that role a million times, like an airport security, fucking parent traveling alone, trying to fold a stroller while some kid has no fucking sympathy for the 50 things she's doing. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  And is poking her.  Or one thing a lot of kids will do, because they're testing their parent, is try to run through security, or run in an area that they know they're going to cause, like, a fucking international shutdown.  Yeah.  So you'll do, as a parent who sympathizes, you'll just take the stroller from her and fold it for her.  Help her out.  Yeah, or grab the kid by the arm a little too hard when they try to run away.  I've done that a couple of times.  It goon on the kid. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  It's a weird world.  I don't know.  I obviously had no fucking idea what I was getting into.  That's another thing.  I think I would probably, if I was a parent, I'd be the one that just buys the kid toys and throws it on the floor and just goes, here you go, fucking play with yourself.  And I would just continue watching TV or going in the pool and drinking.  And let it be known there's a bunch of people applauding you for not having kids.  So not everybody should have.  I just don't think I'm cut out for it.  Not everybody should have them, and you shouldn't have a kid. 
[01:55:30]  See, I have the means.  Please don't.  And I know.  Exactly.  I have the means.  I think I wouldn't go crazy, but I just, I really like where I am, and I don't want any monkey wrench thrown in there.  A hundred percent.  I might regret it, you know, because people always say, well, you're going to regret it later in life.  It's like, well, let's...  No, you won't.  What the fuck?  You know, oh, I want to have a bunch of kids crying at my deathbed?  No.  Give us a shit.  You're fucking dying anyway. 
[01:56:00]  There's not going to be that much comfort.  Yeah, at that point, it's just, you know, whatever.  I was driving through the South once before satellite radio when you drove around the country.  Oh, and you had to change the...  You had to actually take in the local, the cultures.  Yes.  The local asshole.  I was just listening to you guys and 70s hits from fucking coast to coast.  I listened to, you know, you get to like Missouri or Mississippi or wherever it is, and you go, I got one channel.  Yeah.  And it's the fucking preacher. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  And so I'm listening to this Christian radio.  I think I was in Missouri, and they had a show, it was late at night, a talk show.  And they said, we're going to talk about our single friends.  You know, we're all in families because we're God's children and because we're Christians.  But what about your single friends?  You love your single friends.  They're part of your family.  You know, some people, they just end up single, and they're not going to change.  They're not going to have kids.  How do we make them part of the picture?  It was actually a really interesting call. 
[01:57:00]  So the people start calling in.  We have a friend who's single, and he's with us every Christmas.  We treasure him.  He's a big part of our lives.  Then guys start calling in.  I'm single.  Yeah, of course.  And I love the families that I'm part of.  I'm the uncle.  And I realize in the South, single means gay.  Means gay.  It's a polite, in the really Christian South, people that grow up gay, they just call, you're single.  Yeah, they don't want to.  I know.  Because you'd be married because that's what you do. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  If you're in that heavy religious area.  And single would be gay.  And they don't want to acknowledge that they're just gay.  That's hilarious.  You're not in a family.  What about the single people?  Single.  And the story was, really, what do you do with your gay friends?  Yeah.  I mean, they're not doing what they're supposed to do, but you know them and you love them.  What do you do about it?  Well, you have them over for Thanksgiving, you know.  I love being single.  Then back to exile. 
[01:58:00]  And allow them to bring their friend over, right?  Yeah.  He's got other single friends.  His single friend.  He's bringing his friend over today.  His friend.  His single friend.  And he's sucking his single penis.  That is a whole nother world down south like that.  Because, yeah, not very tolerant of things like that.  There are some southern gays who end up here.  Yeah.  Or find a center of gayness to be part of. 
[01:58:30]  Yes.  But then there's other ones who just stay in the south.  And they stay embedded in that culture.  It's just odd.  They're called single.  They don't know.  And at some point, they start living with the guy.  And they just, that's John and Mark.  They live together.  They're roomies.  Yeah.  Roomies.  They're, uh...  Yeah, we did a story years ago about those two guys that were old guys.  Elmer and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was Elmer and some other...  And they were celebrating, like, how long they had been together.  And we...  Because it was like 60 years or something.  Elmer and Gus. 
[01:59:00]  Elmer and Gus.  The longest...  The...  Yeah, they...  They had just been together forever.  The oldest gay couple in New York or something.  Yeah, it was crazy.  They had some kind of distinction.  But we had to think back that, like, it must have been so difficult.  And they actually met during the war or some shit.  In the 40s.  And we're, like, thinking, you know, they come back and they're profiled on some newsreel.  It's like, look at these two fellas, ladies.  They're here looking for...  They're available.  Fresh back from the war.  They're available.  Yes, they live together. 
[01:59:30]  You could double date with a couple of these ladies.  Look at this.  Yes, eligible bachelors.  And, like, just completely not knowing.  They're just ass-fucking every night and loving it.  Well, I think they're making money on the water bill by showering together.  Very economical.  Stuff they must have learned in the military.  Yes.  They bought a nice little house together in Levittown.  He puts his penis in his anus. 
[02:00:00]  In the 40s.  Yes.  Come on, girls.  It must have been rough back then.  Wow.  Well, I met a guy who was, like, 95 upstate.  And he...  Single.  My ex and I had lived up there.  And he told us his life story.  And part of it was...  Must have taken a while.  Well, at some point...  That's a long weekend.  He told us...  At some point, he got to a part where he moved in with his brother-in-law. 
[02:00:30]  He said, and then my brother-in-law moved in together.  And then me and my brother-in-law got this new house.  Like, he lived...  With...  And I think brother-in-law was a code thing back then.  Who lives with their brother-in-law?  Who lives with their brother-in-law?  What does that make any sense?  What is that?  Your sister's husband?  Yeah, really?  You live with just the two of you?  Yeah, where's the sister?  There's no...  It's just brother...  My brother-in-law and I lived together.  Brother-in-law.  That was a...  I think that was a code...  He was basically telling you?  Back in the day.  Did he know he was gay? 
[02:01:00]  What?  Did you know he was gay?  I don't think...  I think that guy would never have in a million years said out loud, I'm gay.  Fessed up to it, but...  He lived with his brother-in-law.  They probably shared 50 years of life together.  Wow.  But pretty much every drop have come into one another for all that time.  But if you said, are you gay?  He'd be like, what are you talking about?  What kind of thing is it to say?  Yeah, yeah.  Brother-in-law is an odd thing.  I guess, yeah, over the years, it had to have been different terms.  I mean, gay was happy and gay before it became gay. 
[02:01:30]  Queer was just something a little odd.  You wouldn't identify something like that.  No.  It was just something that happened, I think.  Yeah.  Because even that, in old movies, you hear, it's like, wow, that situation's a bit queer.  Yeah.  You know?  And queer became, hey, I think he's queer.  It was the first guy that used that one.  It must have gotten a good laugh, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See those two guys?  I think they're queer.  Ah!  You just call them queer?  That's hilarious.  That's a great way to put it. 
[02:02:00]  They are.  That's hilarious.  They are queer.  Let's start using that.  And then someone else hears it.  It's like, wait a minute.  My friend, I think he made that up.  Spreads like wildfire.  Hey, yes, yes.  Well, Louie, what a great hour, man.  I think most people enjoy this.  I'm sure.  Oh, please.  Of course.  But in general, I think it was a great hour and a half.  Stupid guy from Allentown didn't like it.  Why don't we take a break?  Go play with your iron coke and chromium steel.  Yeah.  We'll talk about other stuff.  Clank.  People want to talk about last night's Louie episode.  I haven't seen it, but fuck it.  Ah, spoilers.  Ah, it's fine.  Yeah, it's okay.  It's fine. 
[02:02:30]  We should talk about it, because a bunch of people really want to.  Are you promoting anything else, Louie?  No, I mean, just the show's on every Thursday.  I know.  Doing real well.  10.30.  Are you doing less road stuff?  Well, I guess I got, what do I have in August?  First week of August, I'm in Cohasset, Massachusetts,  in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, and Newport, Rhode Island.  First week of August, and Hyannis.  I'm doing all these, like, tents and places.  That's bullshit. 
[02:03:00]  I'm doing a spray of summer gigs.  The Enormo Dome somewhere.  Yeah, no, none of them are.  They're just the little places.  That's cool.  But doing those first week of August in New England.  Ah.  But no, I do the road for, like, the fall.  The show comes back when it comes, if it comes back again in June.  Yeah, I think you'll get a good shot at that.  So, we'll probably get a third season.  Of course you will.  Something weird would have to happen.  But, you know, I mean, Rupert Murdoch is going to be a show.  I work for him.  I know you work for him. 
[02:03:30]  So, I mess up a lot of things.  Ah, that's great.  I always think that way, that something, because that's happened to me.  I mean, HBO used to be a place I could order gigs from, like a restaurant.  They'd just do anything I wanted to.  And then the guy who was running it fucking slapped a woman in front of a camera in Vegas.  And that was the end of it.  That was the end of it.  I called HBO.  They're like, who?  Ah.  It was all hinging on this one fucking dude.  It really is.  For all the benefits you get from being in a certain business, you know, you're by the 
[02:04:00]  tips of your fingernails.  You're hanging on with no security whatsoever that this will continue past the next minute.  No, you've got to be ready to go.  Yeah, you've got to be ready to transition all the time.  When my agent calls, I'm just thinking, all right, let me start thinking, what am I going  to do?  Yeah.  What am I going to do?  This could be you don't have a job anymore.  Yeah, so I don't believe in that.  I mean, Jesus, you guys are in a volatile fucking place.  Oh, it's stupid.  All this shit could, all these companies could, you know. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, they just merge, fold.  You become redundant.  No, I remember when we used to work, when I used to work just comedy clubs, and there'd be  one-nighters, like places that would start becoming a comedy room, and the thing that  we always, I used to tell the comedians when they'd be like complaining, they're not paying  us enough, or that guy's a dick, I'm like, you don't understand, he could clear the tables  and chairs, turn the radio up real loud, and make 50 times the money.  Just fucking, just to lower the lights and turn up the music, and just pour drinks into 
[02:05:00]  people's mouths, and he'll make a fortune.  And we're making them sit at tables and be quiet.  This is not, it's not a good economic model.  He doesn't need you.  No.  That's funny.  Also, Louis C.K. on Twitter, so we'll break, we'll get into some other things next.  Okay.  Do we have you for a while, though?  Yeah, whatever you want.  Nice, we like that.  All right.  The Virus, Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  That's pretty funny.  We got Louis C.K. in studio.  Want to remind people that Louis, the complete first season, is now available on DVD and  Blu-ray.  Yes.  When did that come out?  A couple days ago?  No, June.  Oh, it's been out a while.  Oh, all right.  Roland just wanted to remind people that they can pick that up, and of course, season two  is happening as we speak.  There was a new episode last night.  It's on a little late for us morning guys. 
[02:06:00]  Yes.  That's morning radio guys.  It's on a time 30.  Thank God for DVR.  Yes.  So I'll watch it today.  I can't wait.  Do people that have shows get kind of pissed off at DVRs?  I don't know that...  You know, I'm not sure I understand...  A DVR is like a VCR.  It just records it.  It records the programming.  It tunes your station.  It tunes your tuner to that station.  Yeah.  It records whatever.  And then it records it, but it's like you were watching it.  Yeah.  I would assume that ratings-wise, it has to acknowledge that it's being watched. 
[02:06:30]  I think, and also, the ratings only come from Nielsen families, I think.  Yeah, that archaic.  So none of that matters.  But, Anne, I think to answer your question, it was a transitional period where it did matter,  where people were like, fuck, people are DVR, and we're not getting accurate ratings.  But now I think, in his world, they're living in the world where they understand that whole  game now.  Yeah, they give you the DVR numbers, or a separate number, and there's also encore numbers, there's  cumulative numbers.  And also, they don't, you know, they want people to watch the advertising. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  But, overall, they want the show to become a hit and have a lot of watching.  So in the early runnings, they just want people to sample it.  That's the big thing.  They don't care where they see it.  Uh-huh.  They want folks to sample it.  The more eyeballs see the show, then the better ratio you have of, like, rejection.  You know, you're going to get, like, whatever.  On my show, probably out of every ten people that see it, three people are going to want  to watch it.  Because it's pretty disgusting. 
[02:07:30]  What the fuck?  I have a pretty narrow audience.  Wow.  Because I curse on the show.  Yeah.  And I cover some pretty, you know, unhappy ground.  People aren't really, most people aren't going to like it.  So they want, you know, ten million people to check it out so they can have the three  million who will stick around.  That will stay around.  Yeah, exactly.  Watch it on a regular basis.  It means there's seven million people around who, like, hate you.  So there's that.  That's fucked up.  There's that, too.  I think with the DVRing, though, it takes away from the competition aspect. 
[02:08:00]  Like, you'd have networks battling it out.  Who's going to, you know, which show is going to win Thursday night?  But now you can watch both shows.  Or you can watch three fucking shows that are all on at the same time and watch them  at various times.  So you're not really getting any one show that's the big hit that's going to demand  more advertising dollars because it's beating two other shows.  Well, and what people, at first they said, well, the DVR'd show loses because folks can 
[02:08:30]  speed through the ads.  But, again, more people are checking it out.  And after a while, the DVR'd show might start winning and get watched live more.  If people like a show enough, they'll want to see it as soon as they can.  To me, the goal is to have people so compelled by the show that they're like, I'm going to  be sitting there at 10.30 on Thursday because I like the show that much rather than, ah,  it's on my DVR.  I'll see it.  That's how, yeah. 
[02:09:00]  There are a few shows like that.  There are very few.  Very few.  I think it's a big scheduling thing, too.  We used to just have to, you had to watch it when it was on.  Yeah.  Or you didn't see it.  That's how shit worked.  Then there's ways, like, through the fucking, the internet and through promotion that more  people that are likely to like the show will end up sampling it.  And critics.  Likely to like.  Yeah.  So that's when shit, like, that's the only reason I give a shit about critics or the 
[02:09:30]  awards.  I'm really happy that we got nominated in our first year.  Four Emmys for Louis in general.  Because, because the show will get more people will see it.  That's, I want FX to get paid back for having given me the show.  I don't care.  Like, I literally will get no joy from owning these fucking statues.  I don't give a shit.  You don't put them up on the mantle?  Yeah.  Like, Lucy and Desi had those.  I have one from when I was on Chris Rock's show.  Right.  It just sits there and it's weird. 
[02:10:00]  Where is it again?  It's weird.  I think it's all this years ago.  It's on my mantle now.  I've got a, I didn't have one before.  Okay.  You need a mantle.  You have a mantle.  Once you have it, I mean, you need a mantle.  And the reason those are important to me is because the show, I want, FX gave me the  show.  The show to me is, I, it's the greatest thing in the world, this show to me.  But I want them to be told by establishment that it was a good idea.  So that they'll let me keep doing it.  And that they believed in you.  Yeah.  And then other shows will get to be done with the same.  Right.  Somebody needs to, because this guy spent, we also, me and the network together, we spend 
[02:10:30]  like a hundredth, literally, of the money that NBC does.  Wow.  And we got, and we're nominated alongside with their shows.  So.  Yeah.  It cost us less.  That's good.  I got, I got to ask you.  So the Joan Rivers show is terrific.  The show, all the shows so far this season have been terrific.  The homeless guy.  Yeah.  Is that based on anything?  The one that gets.  The guy that got slammed by the truck.  Yeah.  No.  Well, I've had moments where you sort of get noticed by a homeless guy, like you get locked 
[02:11:00]  in on.  Yeah.  Nothing like that ever happened, but I just got this idea in my head.  What if there was a really well filmed, like a really fucking horrible moment?  It was horrific.  Yeah.  The redhead gets ripped off.  And what would the rest of your day be like?  That was fascinating.  And the reason his head comes off, that was a conscious decision, because I wanted it to  be clear that there's nothing that I could do.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  I'm sort of part of what happened. 
[02:11:30]  I kind of got this guy killed.  But there's no mouth to mouth.  There's no CPR.  No.  There's no sticking around with my eyebrows knit.  Look, oh, is he all right?  Is he going to be okay?  His head came off his body.  That means just walk away.  I'm not going to hang around and look at his fucking head.  But you saw it.  It's not even appropriate to hang around.  Yeah.  And your whole day was fucked up.  But you're not going to cancel.  Who are you going to call people?  I can't.  I just saw a guy's head.  He's going to come off.  But that's why I have to that one.  Well, are you going to be okay tomorrow?  But that's the shit no one sees on a show or on an idea. 
[02:12:00]  What would happen right after that?  And you just go about your day, but your day becomes very fucked up.  Yes, it does.  Because you saw a man's head come off.  That's why it's so brilliant.  It's brilliant.  I don't have to tell you, but it's absolutely brilliant because you have no real connection  to that guy.  No.  If it was someone you knew, of course your whole day would stop.  Yes.  But I was just involved enough that it fucked with me.  Right.  But you're not involved enough to call this woman and say, listen, I'm not going to go  out with you because I just saw this happen. 
[02:12:30]  Some guy's head come off.  But the reason I love doing the show is because that's only half the episode.  And the idea didn't merit a whole story.  If I was on a sitcom, I'd have to be like, well, then we have to meet the mother of the  homeless guy.  You have to find out why you told this story.  It was interesting for one more scene and then fuck it.  It's over.  Yeah.  Right.  Move on.  Go to me on stage.  Second story for the second. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  Someone wants to talk about last night's episode.  Where are we?  Okay.  Let me say hi to Jimmy in Jersey.  Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  It's a big, big fan.  Louie.  Last night's show had me laughing so much.  I woke everybody up in the house.  The scene with you and the girls in the car singing the song had me hysterically laughing.  Thanks, man.  It was the funniest thing, man.  I got it.  I got it.  Do you do it?  Because it's so relatable to me.  I'm that total fool at the red light singing like a dummy with my kid in the backseat. 
[02:13:30]  Do you do that with the girls?  All the, you know, yeah, that's where that came from.  I was with my girls and I was started and Who Are You came on.  And I cranked it up and started singing it.  And I wasn't having a good day with the kids.  We weren't getting along much.  And I just turned it way up.  And they just looked at me with their crabby faces like, what is this?  And I just sing it.  Who the fuck are you?  And I got really into it.  And it was so cathartic. 
[02:14:00]  I did.  I just sang the whole song.  And so I called my producer and said, can we get the rights to the Who Are You?  And it took us about like six months to get it.  But we got it.  Wow.  It was pretty cheap.  It ended up, we had to send it, the script to Pete Townsend and send him the DVD of the show.  Right.  Wow.  And he personally, I mean, he brought the price down.  It was like $150,000.  Holy shit.  And so he watched it.  It took a whole half a year to get it through that system.  Damn.  And then he wrote back and said, you can add it for $7,000. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Damn, that is discount.  Nothing.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's the whole song.  I mean, we ended up editing it, but what we got rights to is the entire song.  Wow.  Boy, sometimes you could get rights for, what, 30 seconds or something?  Yeah, well, they'll make less.  They'll charge you less if you're only using like a sting from the song or a little bit.  Oh, I don't know.  But we wanted the entire song.  Right.  But once I cut it to it, I'm like, I can't make people listen to this.  It's a great song.  The whole song.  Yeah.  I can't wait to watch it now.  Matt in Canada.  Matt.  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  Hey, man. 
[02:15:00]  Louie, I was watching.  I'm up in Iqaluit, and your show is like the only highlight of my week because it's like  I'm as far north in Canada as you can get working for the summer.  And it was weird, the Blueberries episode I was watching, and I got turned on by you  and the girl, more of the girl than anything, but it was one of the weirder things I've ever  had in my entire life because I never thought of you as sort of a sexual arousing person.  And I was so, and my girlfriend and I are up here, and she wanted to have sex after 
[02:15:30]  the episode because I think it turned her on, too, but I really wasn't in the mood.  Oh, my God.  Honestly, Louie, one of the fucking weirdest things I've had in my entire life.  But you were turned on by Louie?  No, it was just the situation.  Okay.  The whole situation.  Well, I guess it could be like a fantasy thing where it's not so much Louie and that  girl.  Well, it's like when you watch porn, if there wasn't, if the guy's cock wasn't in it, it 
[02:16:00]  wouldn't be arousing.  But so in a way, you're getting turned on by a guy's cock.  Yeah, you need like.  You're watching a guy's, if she was just sucking a, you know, like whenever they do  porn with dildos.  Dildos.  Nothing.  No, it doesn't work.  Nothing.  Because you're kind of living vicariously through the movie.  You're not going, wow, that's great that there's cock in here.  Thank God they have cock here.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's like, I would love that done to my cock.  Yes.  That would be.  Well, that definitely, if you have a girlfriend, I could see.  I mean, because that episode is just about two grownups saying we're going to have sexual 
[02:16:30]  intercourse now.  Yes.  And going through the motions very deliberately.  And the kicker in that one is hilarious.  I mean, I, I didn't, I did not see that coming.  When she starts crying.  It's hilarious.  It's brilliant.  Because it comes out of nowhere.  You're just like, wait, what the, what the fuck just happened?  And you're just like.  You know, it's, that wasn't even supposed to be.  I had written the story about this woman who's like trying to make a guy into a husband, like  automatically. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like talking while she's putting cream on and sending you out for shit.  Um, and I didn't know where it was going.  And I, Pamela Adlon, who she's a producer on the show.  Also, she, that's the only, the only episode that I ever gave any credit, writing credit  to anybody else.  She has story by credit because we kind of came up with that together.  And then her idea was we had had this loose idea about a woman being spanked sexually and  then breaking down into tears.  And that was her idea. 
[02:17:30]  And so she said, what about it?  What if this woman is that?  So I wrote a version with it, but after, and then I sent it to my producer and then I  thought that's not a good, that I wrote a different ending, but that the woman who did  it, she's the only one who auditioned who cried because she got the wrong script.  Oh shit.  So I was watching her audition and she starts doing this daddy, daddy.  And I was like, oh fuck, nobody was supposed to get that.  Like I was a little embarrassed.  Oh shit.  But she was so good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maria Dietze, her name was.  It was great.  So she ended up making me want to put it back. 
[02:18:00]  She's saying that.  And, and I think what I picked up from your character was you were getting a little weirded  out by it, but going through the motions.  And then it just took the next step of weirdness when she starts crying.  It's like, what the fuck do I do now?  Yeah.  It's almost great.  You're just in a person's bad place.  And then it turned out to be sort of feel like the blueberries were, she knew she'd need 
[02:18:30]  them because once she, I think she knew all this shit was going to happen.  She brings the guy home, makes him uncomfortable, has him spank her, cries, and then blueberries  and whipped cream should be fine.  I have to have the blueberries and whipped cream to.  Yeah.  It's great.  There are those people who, who take you through their fucking, when you're single.  That, when you, when you were sex, single a second time after divorce, you've realized  that you, that thing you always wanted to get some pussy and it turns out it's a really 
[02:19:00]  intimate thing.  You know, it's really like, this is a fucking human being and they're a stranger and I'm  naked next to them in their fucking bedroom.  Ugh.  Ugh.  You realize it's way more involved.  Yeah, man.  When you're 20, 21, who gives a fuck?  Oh man, that is, that is fucking good.  Yeah, so this was that.  When I, when I look at a show like, uh, Seinfeld and it was called Seinfeld and it was Jerry 
[02:19:30]  Seinfeld in the show.  Yeah.  Uh, it, but that wasn't Jerry.  Jerry, that was, there was a part of Jerry, but it was, from what I've heard, it's more  Larry David.  It was more Larry, obviously.  It's his life.  Now, when you say like you, you got nominated for acting.  Yeah.  How much of the character is really you and how much acting are you doing?  Well, I'm not character acting.  I mean, I think that's, I don't know much about acting academically, but, uh, even though 
[02:20:00]  I've just been nominated.  It's one of the best, that's why, that's why I'm laughing.  It's the best television actors in the entire country.  No.  Nominated for an Emmy.  Yeah.  Or is acting.  I don't know much about it.  I don't know much about it.  Well, because character acting is where you create the whole person.  Right.  But I'm not doing that.  I mean, then there's acting where you're just beating in the situation and none of these  things have happened to me and none of them are really happening on the show.  It's all fiction.  But I would assume it's an exaggerated version of your personality. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, I don't act this way in life at all.  Right.  And it's actually really fun that way that I put myself, I make myself make really big  mistakes.  And it's also how I get to do things that are, um, controversial or sticky is that I make  myself the big idiot.  Right.  I make mistakes and, uh, and I look stupid and that allows me to have some fucked up things  happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, like Nick DePaulo and I had the episode where we got in a fight politically. 
[02:21:00]  And the thing that was important to me was that I sound like a bigger idiot than he does  because I'm tend to be liberal and he tends to be conservative.  So I wrote him a really good argument and I wrote, and I just, you're a Nazi.  I just made myself into an asshole on purpose because then I'm not preaching and I'm not  trying to take it.  I get to have a really interesting political discussion.  Without it coming off like, oh, what kind of agenda is he trying to push?  So I come off like a dick. 
[02:21:30]  Right.  But I think that's pretty brave to do.  I think other people would use that power to go, no, I am liberal in my real life and  I got this outlet.  But no one's going to listen.  No one's going to hear it.  It's brave though, but I think a lot of people do it the other way.  They do and then they fail.  That's what I'm saying.  And nobody wants to see it, but I get to do this.  Preachy ass hole, fuck you.  There's an episode, not the next, but the one after, where there's a guy on who I have  a really big conflict with.  I can't tell you about it until you see it.  But the way I got this person to be on the show and I got this fucked up thing to happen, 
[02:22:00]  it's really weird, was that I wrote myself wrong.  Like I made me wrong.  Oh, really?  And I made him right.  Wow.  And it was well worth it because I got to have this explosive moment.  Anyway, let me go to Kevin in Connecticut.  There's a good one too.  Is it the Kevin from Connecticut?  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, buddy.  He's a regular.  Hi, Squeezy.  Hey.  I just said it.  Jesus.  Hey, Louie, the one thing that I noticed that you do really well is just create uncomfortability, 
[02:22:30]  whether it's for yourself or for, like, your aunt, your racist aunt.  It was fantastic.  Yeah, she gives us a plate of Brazil nuts and she says, would you like a nigger toe?  Right.  Yes, that was, but that's what they were called growing up.  That's what they were called.  Yeah.  Can I ask, I didn't get to, I didn't see the episode, unfortunately.  That fact was beyond cool with that, huh? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, they didn't.  Well, there was a, I got a request to cut, she says, actually, she says nigger toe three  times.  And then I say the same word in my stand-up later in the episode, and she asked me to  cut a few out.  But I pushed back and I got more in than she asked for.  Yeah.  One more thing, Louie, please.  Yeah.  Last year, I noticed a lot that you put the word AIDS in a lot of episodes.  That was intentional, I'm sure. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, there's a few places, like, I'm on the subway and it says AIDS on the window.  And then there was, we're in a Catholic school and it says AIDS on the blackboard.  Mike, every word was small except the word AIDS.  Yeah.  I don't know, it's a really obnoxious thing, because it's my, I have full control of this  world.  So it's just like, yeah, I want AIDS.  Yeah, we're shooting on the subway, that's our dedicated subway train, and I felt like the  window was too clean. 
[02:24:00]  So I said, just give me a marker, and I just wrote AIDS on the window in front of me.  What do you mean they gave you a dedicated subway train?  Well, we had a subway, that one we shot on Randall Island, where the firemen practice  getting people out of a burning subway.  Right.  It used to be you could shoot on that subway train, but it didn't move.  You had to, like, have 10 grips on the roof.  Yeah, yeah.  Rocking it, so it looked like it was moving.  It was kind of shitty, but they don't let you use it anymore.  This year, we shot a subway scene that's on next week, and we actually took control of 
[02:24:30]  a train.  Oh, wow.  And we had the shuttle train that goes from Grand Central to 8th Avenue or whatever.  It just has, it's a one-stop train.  Wow.  What is that?  So they shut it down for the night, and then we go back and forth and back and forth.  What kind of, like, who do you ask, who do you ask to have that?  It's a fucking pain in the ass.  That's gotta be.  You have to have sit-down meetings with the transit cops, and the transit authority has  to approve it.  You have to send them the script. 
[02:25:00]  They have to approve the script.  And there was one thing I wanted to do.  It's a whole episode where I'm just observing things on the subway, and there's one thing  I wanted desperately, and they wouldn't let me have it.  The scene where there's a guy with a briefcase eating an ice cream cone, and the napkin from  his ice cream floats out of his hand and down into the tracks.  Right.  And so he just climbs down into the tracks and gets the napkin and climbs out, kind  of not so long before a train, then a train comes. 
[02:25:30]  And I had it in my head.  I was like, I just want to see that moment, and then you just see me go, what the fuck?  Like, it was a little, it's a subtle thing.  Right, right.  But I wanted it so bad, and they told us that it would cost us $28,000 because he had to  go to track school.  We had to send a guy through track school for two months.  What the fuck?  What's track school?  Track school is how you learn to be down on the tracks and not hurt yourself.  And they'd have to shut the third rail down for, like, two sections.  And they said we could do it, but it would cost $28,000.  Wow.  I almost did.  I almost said, fuck it. 
[02:26:00]  I want it.  I want that shot.  Yeah.  But it was fiscally irresponsible.  Irresponsible, yeah.  At the beginning of every season, I tell my production crew, here are the big things I  want.  And they start working on getting them.  So they start working on the subway.  It was the last thing we shot.  It took all fucking season to negotiate the day on the subway, and it took all season  to get the Pete Townsend thing.  And then we shot this thing that takes place in Afghanistan, and we have helicopters, this  whole crazy sequence. 
[02:26:30]  That took a year.  That before, I mean, as soon as I got renewed, I said, go get Afghanistan.  And we got the army involved.  This is crazy thing.  This is insanity.  That episode's going to be sick.  And we also got FX to give us double budget for that one episode.  Wow.  And that took months to get approved by them.  But if you just take the time, you can do shit like that.  You need the right people, though, too. 
[02:27:00]  You can just send some dick to go.  No, you have to have a really...  So I need to get this done.  Who do I...  Yes.  Well, he has FX behind him a little bit.  That helps.  Well, because people...  Not really, because we act alone.  We don't...  They don't even know what we're doing.  They don't know what the show's about.  Oh, that's true.  The best way.  You've said that a few times.  Damn, man.  The Afghanistan script is the only one I ever gave them ahead of time, because I wanted  to...  I said, I want double the money for one episode.  And they're like, well, you got to let us read it at least.  No.  So I gave them the script.  And, you know, but everybody tries to tell you, you can't do it. 
[02:27:30]  You're going to need the army, and they won't do it.  But pick up the fucking phone and call the Pentagon.  That's what we did.  Jesus.  And said, hi, we have a TV show, and we'd like your cooperation.  And they're like, huh.  Call back tomorrow.  They...  Six calls.  They just say, fuck you.  Yeah, yeah.  And at some point, they go, this guy's not going away.  Okay.  You should talk to John.  Wow.  And it took us all year, but we shot that fucking episode.  It's like Apocalypse Now.  It's beautiful.  Holy shit.  I can't wait to see it.  Sick.  It's great.  It's going to be an hour.  It's an hour long episode.  That's amazing.  Anything else, Kevin? 
[02:28:00]  I just wanted to say, I love the show.  Thanks, man.  I think I love it.  I love it, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  No.  Ah, you are.  Hey, Louis, during the break, was telling us about the apartment they use in the show.  Yeah.  And actually, he still has it.  It's a real apartment.  Yeah, we kept it because we don't want to lose the location.  It's a real apartment, and we're not in a studio.  But it's my apartment.  They gave me the keys because it's my company.  So once we shut down the company for the year, they said, here's the keys to the apartment,  by the way.  So I have this apartment. 
[02:28:30]  So you've got your TV apartment.  Yes.  And when I'm getting my kitchen redone, I think later this year, and I'm going to move my  kids into that.  Into the TV apartment.  Yeah.  In my fictional apartment.  How do you deal with the building as far as lighting?  They're great.  We don't fuck with people much.  We're behind the door.  There's one neighbor to our apartment who hates us.  Really?  Yeah.  And he'll stand right outside the door and talk on his cell phone loud, and he'll do  passive-aggressive shit.  He hates us.  Who would hate having a TV show film right next to him? 
[02:29:00]  I don't understand that.  A lot of New Yorkers, just as soon as they see a light stand, they're like, oh, I shouldn't  have to deal with that.  They just think...  Yeah, that's a real hassle.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fuck you.  We'll have real problems.  I think it's cool as hell when I see those...  Yeah, me too.  I always want to cooperate.  When there's a set.  Yeah.  There's a...  Yeah, because I would assume...  Well, you did a hallway shot there where you're bringing your sister out.  Yeah, we were screaming and yelling.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's why he hates us.  It's probably a little justified.  That must have been one where... 
[02:29:30]  Oh, when the neighbor's home, the guy who's...  Yeah, she was fucking howling and screaming.  Yeah, yeah.  That was great.  That's a great episode.  It was like 8 o'clock at night.  It was probably not fun for him.  With the guy who was living with his brother-in-law?  Yes.  That was great.  It's like the whole confusion of whether you should just leave this stranger with your  kids and she's got to go to the hospital and...  Yeah, because I don't really want to talk to any strangers.  Right, right.  But I had to do it.  Yeah.  He's the guy.  He was in a play with Chris Rock called Motherfucker with a Hat. 
[02:30:00]  And I saw the play and he was amazing.  So I wrote it.  He made me write the episode.  Wow.  I can't wait to see that play.  It's really good.  I know.  We could go anytime.  I'm just trying to find a babysitter.  It's worth it.  There you go.  Back to your point.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's something I would love to do and I just got to figure it out.  Oh, well.  Matt in Boston.  What's up, buddy?  Oh, dude.  Louie, love the friggin' show.  It's amazing.  Thanks.  That episode where you spanking that chick, I went from laughing my ass off to completely 
[02:30:30]  pissed because I'm like, why are you dealing with this whore?  Get the fuck out.  I spanked her and I got half a rod watching it with my wife.  Wow.  This is all right.  Who knew this was such a turn on?  And then where did it go?  That's an...  And then she starts fucking crying.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me because you ruined my night right away.  And then you're going to get...  And then she's eating the blueberries and I'm just like, holy shit.  I'm like, what just happened there?  I just got emotionally raped by Louie C. 
[02:31:00]  That's good.  Emotionally raped, yeah.  But why can't you continue to be turned on when she's crying?  Why not?  You have to be a different kind of person.  All right.  I'm a different kind of person.  I think you get different reactions from that scene, obviously.  No, that's great.  But that's the perfect reaction.  I always...  I never want people to expect anything.  And that's what...  To me, I want people to be going, what the fuck?  Or...  Because the show's not always like, ha-ha funny.  But if it's not being funny, it has to be very something. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It has to have a big spike.  It has to make you go...  There's some moments where you're just like, oh, my God.  What the fuck?  That's horrible.  Yes.  To me, that's as good as a laugh.  Yeah.  If people are horrified or very curious or startled, that's as good as a laugh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, just a high-octane moment.  When the head flies off.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Like we said earlier.  And that looks so real.  That didn't look like a dummy head.  We got the...  That was a $4,000 head, that head. 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  And we negotiated it down.  That was another take of a look at it, right?  They knew they had a good head.  They're like, our head is great, and you're going to pay for it.  Well, we had it made for us.  We had it made after the guy.  That costs a shitload of money to get the cast done and get the head made and painted.  Is there someone that specializes in that shit?  Well, yeah.  It's a competitive field, so that's why we were able to get the price down.  Yeah.  Really?  Because there was a place that wanted $16,000 for the head, and then this guy said, a new 
[02:32:30]  guy said, I could do it for $4,000, and it's really good material.  Do that head.  Yeah, exactly.  But we shut down an intersection.  We had a crane holding up, because it's a composite shot.  You shoot a plate, and then you...  We had a crane holding a dummy up like a marionette, and we hit it with this garbage truck, and the  fucking dummy got in the...  It pierced a gas tank, and we spilled diesel fuel all over 10th Avenue.  Holy shit.  That'll cost a fucking nightmare. 
[02:33:00]  That was the hardest thing we did.  Is that one of those...  All season was that hit and killing that bum.  Is that one of those shots, too?  You got to get it right the first time?  You didn't have any more...  Well, you get a really pristine dummy for the first take, and then after that, you're  getting a less and less...  You get a one-armed dummy after a while.  But what about the head itself?  The head, we saved.  I mean, we rolled it down the street a few times.  If you look at it, there's about 30 shots in the sequence.  But we rolled it down the street, which it survived fine. 
[02:33:30]  But then finally, we propped the head up on the good head on the dummy, and came...  And I had the camera.  I was running the camera, and I was looking right at the garbage truck, and the dummy's  right between me and the garbage truck.  And this garbage truck gets fucking blue smoke behind it, like it was like a bull coming  at me.  And it was one of those moments where I realized, I'm in fucking danger right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he's basically hitting a missile that's going to come at me.  And we let him hit the fucking head and the dummy head straight on. 
[02:34:00]  And it was beautiful.  And the truck stopped about an inch from the camera.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it was...  I wasn't scared, though.  I was excited because I was getting the shot.  Yeah.  If you're getting footage, you don't feel fear.  You just get excited.  Right on.  I'm going to watch that again now just to see that part.  Yeah, that was a lot.  That was two days.  Two different days.  Two days.  Two different intersections, too.  They don't match because we got kicked out.  Oh, wow.  We caused so much problems at 10th Avenue and 28th Street that we couldn't get re-permitted 
[02:34:30]  to shoot the second half of the scene.  So we had to go up to 38th or somewhere.  Holy shit.  So if you look at it carefully, shot to shot, it keeps shifting which intersection it is.  And we got some of the extras back, but not all of them.  So some of the people...  And no one noticed.  No.  I love that shit.  I love trying to pick out films.  Yeah, me too.  I love that.  If you watch car chases, you know where the car's going to go because he's following his own rubber on the road. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The tire tracks.  Because they've already done it a bunch of times.  So they start...  Any Hal Needham movie was always bad.  Those Burt Reynolds movies.  The cops are chasing him.  And you see the skid marks going around the corner before they get there.  Because they're not cleaning the fucking roads.  Yeah, they can't clean it up.  Back then, they couldn't, you know, composite it out.  I used to get all the books, the Film Club books, and there'd be old westerns where you see where planes did fly by because the trails and stuff.  You're like, wait a minute.  There were no planes when this movie was supposed to take place. 
[02:35:30]  I love all that shit.  No, me too.  Didn't you say that you had to switch out one of your daughters and no one noticed?  Yeah, the first season, there's two kids within one episode.  I never noticed.  There's two different kids playing Jane, the little one.  Were you scared that, oh, fuck, people are so going to notice this?  I kind of didn't give a shit because the show doesn't hinge on that.  Everybody's like, I can't wait to see that girl.  They're just like, what happens in this story?  Whatever it is.  Also, what I've tried to train the audience, don't worry about the continuity.  But how did no one notice? 
[02:36:00]  Nobody did.  I thought, I was worried the network would get mad because they, when we started, they said they wanted to make all of our talent deals and they wanted me to have responsible series deals where you lock an actor down for a year.  But I don't know that I'm ever going to use anybody more than once.  Yeah.  So they get paid when they work.  That's all my actors have no, I have no hold on these people.  I love that you don't feel like you have to use someone more than once.  I love that.  The shows, the way shows are built, it's backwards.  They get, they decide before they even shoot anything, these seven people are all going to be really interesting. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And they pay them all for a year of television.  Then they're forced to use them every show.  And if they stop being interesting, they still have to be in.  They have to be in it because they're locked in.  Yeah.  Instead of going, let's get a bunch of rookies and see who plays their way on the squad.  If somebody stays interesting, you use them.  If they don't, you just let them fucking die.  Yeah.  Who gives a shit?  Like our pal Bob Kelly was your brother.  Yeah, he's gone.  And you're not even using him in the second season. 
[02:37:00]  And it had nothing to do with Bobby.  He did a great job season one.  He was great.  He was so good.  I just didn't have any ideas for season two.  So you said, all right, he's gone for now.  Or maybe he'll come back.  Maybe he never comes back.  This season, I have two sisters.  And I don't know that I'll use them again.  The first episode of the year is my sister gets introduced and the neighbor who says,  don't forget who your neighbors are.  Yeah.  He's not in any more episodes.  Not in any more episodes.  He forgot who the neighbor was.  Well, because that's the last one I shot.  It was one of the last ones I shot.  Yeah.  And it turned out to be the season premiere. 
[02:37:30]  And no other show would have let me do that.  I couldn't have done that.  But nobody gives a shit on my show, I don't think.  It's amazing.  There's no one on Louie's show that walks in the door and gets up, has to deliver half  the line and then stop and then repeat it like Richie Cunningham.  Like I was saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just thought I'd come over and it's so stupid.  It is ridiculous. 
[02:38:00]  And then the other characters don't go, why did you stop talking for 40 seconds?  What happened?  Just looking around a little bit.  Or do a little Fonzie thing.  That Blueberry episode keeps coming up with the listeners.  Listen to this one.  Mike in New York.  Go ahead.  Louie C.K. in studio, of course.  Yo, Louie.  What's up, bro?  Big man.  Thank you.  How you doing?  Love Lucky Louie.  Love the new show.  Thanks.  For the longest time, I've been trying to get my wife to watch the show.  You've got to watch it.  It's hilarious.  And as luck would have it, it was the Fuck Me Daddy show. 
[02:38:30]  I'm sorry, dude.  You lost her.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Oh, come on now.  Look, if that scared her away, tell her to stay away then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Best she doesn't watch.  Yeah.  Louie doesn't need her then.  I'll be like that, dude.  Thanks, man.  I'm glad you didn't change the beginning either.  Not just the music, but sometimes people change the beginning of the show to show that it's  a new season or something.  But because I always now pick out where that guy flips the bird and your face looking and 
[02:39:00]  then look at the camera.  It's like, are we still going to use it?  Yeah.  There's such confusion in your face.  I still remember that.  But then it's just, fuck it.  Let's keep eating the pizza.  Yeah.  I saw it as this could be either really good or really bad.  Like, he wasn't sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was like, fuck, I know we were filming something else, but that just happened.  That's a great moment.  But he makes eye contact with the camera.  And then it's like, will FX allow me to use it?  Which is funny.  There was a whole thing that I could kind of see in that little moment. 
[02:39:30]  I remember when the kid did that.  It was an Asian kid with spiky hair.  And it was just one of these contrary people.  Fuck you, camera.  Like, for no reason.  Yeah, we're working here.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's like I was working with some musicians doing music for a movie thing.  And we were in the East Village when the East Village was like a contrary place.  And so we were standing on the corner, me and these musicians with guitars.  And this punk, rocky guy walks by.  And he goes, oh, rock and roll. 
[02:40:00]  What the fuck?  And Todd Berry was there.  And he said, yeah, man, we're making an effort to do a thing.  What a bummer.  What a bummer.  What a bunch of assholes we are.  That's what it felt like.  This guy's like, oh, yeah, fuck Cameron.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And it was really funny to me that he did it.  And the look to me was like, I really hope we got that.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I wanted to.  Like, to me, that moment that that kid gave the finger to the camera, wherever he is.  Yeah, we were just watching it.  I thought, yeah, right?  This exact, what I'm thinking right at that moment is, I think we're going to get on the air. 
[02:40:30]  Because this is the final.  You turn your head, though.  You look at him.  I'm really pleased.  And then you look at the camera.  I know.  Because I thought that, because it gave me a clear vision of, like, that's going to be on the opening credits.  Yeah.  And some people, I could tell because I knew what lens we were using.  And I'd say, he's going to be soft.  And some people will see it and some won't.  And it'll get on the air.  Have you ever run into that guy?  No, no.  No.  And I don't know if the standards people realize that I, because a middle finger is a big thing for us. 
[02:41:00]  And I got to fight for them.  I've had a few.  But I don't know if they realize that we're starting every show with a finger.  Why is the middle finger a big deal when the language is pretty accurate?  Because it's a clear fuck.  Anything that it refers.  Like, on the first episode, we had F, the woman that plays my sister says, F her and F them.  And they said, take it out. 
[02:41:30]  We don't allow F you.  Huh.  Because it's just saying, fuck you.  But I fought them on it.  And I told them it was really an import.  I thought, because she wanted it to be screw you or she said, or let her say, fuck you and bleep it.  Oh.  And I said, but then it really is fuck.  I was trying to show somebody who's trying not to say fuck.  Also, clearly she couldn't.  And I say fuck and she says fuck in this show.  Yeah.  And bleep it.  But she says, F her.  And it's deliberately her trying to be, trying to hold back a little bit.  Fuck her is worse than saying fuck her with the bleep.  With the bleep.  Yep. 
[02:42:00]  That's strange.  Those discussions drive me nuts.  We have them here every once in a while.  It's like, that doesn't make sense.  Or no one's going to care in the end.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  I mean, the woman who does it for me at FX is really smart.  She's fucking brilliant.  And so I think she helps me.  Because I don't know where the line is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I want to do this.  I want to say this.  I want to put a chocolate bar in someone's cunt and eat it.  Can I do that?  Will America be upset?  And she's there to say, you know. 
[02:42:30]  Can we work with that?  You can do it.  Don't call it a cunt.  So you were able to get F her.  Yeah.  She gave me a little one-time dispensation.  Which I think is way more real than bleeping the word, obviously.  Yeah.  It means something different.  When you say F you, you're purposely trying not to say fuck you.  Do you know what I mean?  Right.  You're trying to hold back a little bit.  So I said, this is actually a person trying to show some restraint.  Yeah, restraint.  So she said, oh, I can see that.  And she said, let me have it. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, good for you.  But it's still their policy not to say F you, generally.  Wow, that's weird.  I had no idea.  That's so odd.  I thought that was one they just let through easy.  Yeah.  No clue.  Yeah, but we can say, obviously, we say a lot of nasty.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's hilarious.  Uh, wow.  Yeah, there's a lot of good calls coming in trying to figure out.  Let's go to Tyson in Oklahoma.  Uh, Tyson.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Louie, brilliant, man.  I love the realism. 
[02:43:30]  Everything's fucking dead on.  I was going to bring one up specifically, the airport scene.  You know, now I look at it, I'll tell my friends, just pull Louie.  Because you were so fucking dead on about the lube.  The fucking, everything was so fucking perfect.  And you know what?  If more people had that honesty, I think it'd be much fucking easier in an airport.  Yeah, the lube was great.  Yeah, that was just the lady looking me up and down and going, he's just, he needs this 
[02:44:00]  and he's not hurting anybody.  Yeah.  I'm going to make it like a call, an authoritative call and say, a little common sense, everyone's  well.  Let him keep it.  It could do us all well.  Yeah.  One quick question after that.  Do you really make mango pops?  All the time.  Every time I open a mango, I make a popsicle out of the center of it.  It's delicious.  You only give it to one of the kids, huh?  Yeah, fuck, there's only one.  I'm not going to open two mangoes just to be fair. 
[02:44:30]  It's a fucking waste of food.  It's not like that.  It's not fair.  If you have a sibling, if you have siblings, you don't, you do all this shit equal.  It's just dumb.  It's never going to happen.  What's that?  I was going to say, yeah, man.  It's so real.  Love the show, man.  Thanks.  You're doing great.  I like watching it.  Y'all take a good day.  You do, sir.  I only discovered mangoes in my adult life.  I didn't have that shit growing up.  Yeah.  I fucking love mangoes.  So good.  Really good.  Papaya, not so much, but mangoes, I like the mangoes. 
[02:45:00]  Want to take a break?  Yes, as a matter of fact.  All right.  So Louie's got a lot going on.  Of course, the complete first season's out there to check out if you want to catch up  or you just want to have.  And FX every Thursday night, 1030 for new episodes.  Yes.  And then Louie's got a bunch of gigs happening outdoors.  Yes.  In New England.  First week of August.  Good time to be up there.  Yes.  Very good time.  Where do they go?  Louie C.K. for all the dates? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  On Twitter?  Ticketmaster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know how to sell your shows.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't make much effort.  There's too many of them.  I don't know.  There needs to be a central place.  Yeah.  I know you tweet your gigs and stuff.  I think if you go to Ticketmaster and put my name in, you get all the live shows.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I mean, you've got to go see Louie this summer.  Absolutely.  All right.  We'll finish up with Louie C.K. next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Today, Louie C.K. in studio.  And during the break, we probably shouldn't have broke there, but I guess we have shit  that we have to play.  Because now we just talked about film flubs, and I feel like we should just redo everything  we just said.  You know?  The Midnight Run one was a good one, though. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  If you go back and look at the last scene, the Midnight Run, he gives them a money belt  and says, here's money so you can start a new coffee shop.  And he goes, how much is in there?  And then they shoot this, you see this close-up of De Niro's hands looking at the money, and  you hear Charles Grodin say, it's $100,000.  And it doesn't sound like it's in the movie at all.  They obviously edit it.  And the thing, in the money belt, it's $1,000 bills.  The ridiculous non-existent denomination.  Non-denomination of money, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  If you work on movies, they do this shit.  They fix shit afterwards.  They edited it together, and it probably was, how much could you fit in a money belt?  Probably $20,000, $30,000.  So somebody said, it's $30,000, and they were probably $100 bills.  And somebody said, you could never start a coffee shop for $30,000.  So make them say $100,000.  Yeah, but how does it do that in hundreds?  Yeah.  Make them thousands.  Make them thousands.  But there's no such thing as thousands.  Doesn't matter.  It's just the fucking guy Paramount wants it to be $100,000.  So just so they went out in the parking lot of the editing bay. 
[02:47:30]  And where's Charles Grodin's voice?  Nope.  No.  It's the, yeah, and somebody just did Charles Grodin.  They had to do it over the phone.  Yeah, get us the guy from craft service.  He did a great Charles Grodin impression.  He was having coffee.  We'll toss him a few bucks.  Yep.  I find all that fascinating.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't know why it's so satisfying to the viewer to pick out, like, I saw a camera in the reflection in the window. 
[02:48:00]  Like, it's so satisfying.  Because I guess you're just assuming they want perfection making the movie.  And they do.  Yeah.  To a point, I guess, most people.  So you're just like, I caught them.  I caught them motherfuckers.  Yeah, I know that that's not real.  Yeah, yeah.  Until I saw that camera, I was sure this was all real.  Yes.  Well, I love movies that, like, shitty old movies that just ignore, like, that are so,  like, when you see a guy looking at somebody with a telescope in a movie, and inside the telescope, there's editing and cutting. 
[02:48:30]  Do you know what I mean?  Like, there's two different, like, the guy sees.  This telescope not only magnifies, it also will give you different, like, close-ups.  Yeah, yeah.  Single shots and two shots.  It's a great telescope.  I want one of those, like, editing inside the telescope.  It'll push in.  It'll push in.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  One thing that really got me, and it ruined a part of Indiana Jones for me, because they did, like, in the making of Indiana Jones, they showed it. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Which sucked, because every time you watch the movie after that, you notice when that truck rolls over, you see, what they did pretty much was have this can that launched a piece of a telephone pole out, which flipped the truck over.  Yes.  And it's so visible and obvious once you know it's there.  So every time that happens, I'm like, oh, there's the pole, the piece that's flipping the truck over.  Why don't you pick up on it without, you know what I mean? 
[02:49:30]  You might have, but you're so into the scene.  Well, subconsciously, the first time you watched it.  You get lost in something when you're watching it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're just like, oh, that chick's in the back of that truck.  It just blew up.  But then when someone tells you it's there, you're like, oh, my God, it ruins the scene.  Every time.  Yeah.  And you notice, like, as it's flipping over, the friction from it hitting the ground kind of makes it do this weird spin turn.  Yes.  So it ruins the scene now.  Yeah.  When they show you.  There is a scene in, I think it's To Kill a Mockingbird, old Gregory Peck movie. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody shoots a dog.  Yeah, the rabid dog.  Yeah.  And I think what they did was they tied a string to the dog's back leg, and they just yanked it.  This dog doesn't know it's in a movie.  The dog is, like, just barking.  And then all of a sudden, fuck.  It's just.  Hey, shit.  What the fuck is that?  That's obviously before PETA.  Yeah.  You can't allow that, huh?  What I used to love in Westerns, what they would do to fucking horses.  Knock them down.  Oh, my God. 
[02:50:30]  Now it's just CGI horses or whatever the fuck you got to do.  But they used to take them.  And they'd fucking plow rein a horse where the guy would lean over, grab the rein by  the bit, twist the fucking horse's head around, and the horse would just collapse.  Yep.  Down on his knees.  Nightmare for the horse.  He's trying to get up.  And it's just like, cut, print, perfect.  Beautiful.  That's a great one.  Fuck the horse.  Set up for the 50 horse collision.  Right.  What the fuck are you guys doing to these horses?  Yep. 
[02:51:00]  It's terrible.  Yeah, because they would make it look like the horses are being shot.  The horses are being shot.  They're falling down.  Or for some reason, if the guy got shot, the horse would have to fall, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You shoot a guy on a horse.  It's a hole.  The horse falls down.  He's so upset that his master got shot.  He had to collapse.  Oh, my goodness.  This guy, well, I'll let him say it.  Johnny, North Carolina.  You're on with Louis C.K.  What's up, buddy?  All right.  Louis, you're the man, first off.  But I hate and despise when there's a stunt double, and you could clearly, it's so blatant. 
[02:51:30]  It could be like, you know, John Travolta, and there's a weird black guy stunt double  playing him.  They do such a bad job of matching it up.  They've gotten better over the years.  They have gotten better.  We were talking to turn the brake on them now.  Yeah.  Face Off is, I know it's a pretty shitty movie, but Face Off is the worst for that, because  there's so many action scenes, and Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are pussies and would  refuse to do everything.  It's horrible.  Please.  I like the stuntmen with the best shots of the fire shots, because it's just some guy, 
[02:52:00]  and he's in a car, and the car crashes, ah, bursts into flames, and this guy gets out  in a NASA space suit, and he's just, his arms are straight out.  But he's, he's like walking a little, and, and there's gel, you can see the gel dripping,  and he falls down, and it cuts right after that, because the crew's got to come over  and put him out.  And put him out.  There's some of the worst fucking fire scenes.  What was, I'd rather bad stunts than bad CGI, though, when they have, like, there's some 
[02:52:30]  movie that I just saw a trailer for, and it's some, oh, it's the new Planet of the Apes  movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they show these apes, I'm like, that's a fucking cartoon.  I don't believe that for a second.  Cartoon-y ape.  They don't look the slightest bit real to me.  Yeah.  I'm not going to go see that shit.  I guess it was hard to get chimps to do the real things.  Get to put fucking Roddy McDowell in a fucking mask.  Yeah.  They figured it out.  They did it back in the, it's like, it's the same as we landed on the moon in the 70s.  Roddy McDowell in a mask.  Did we?  And we made Planet of the Apes in the 70s, and somehow we forgot all of that. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  40 years ago, they made them look real.  Yeah.  You're right.  They just put a mask on a fucking actor.  The gorillas looked great in the first Planet of the Apes, too.  They were amazing.  They were really, like, menacing looking.  I remember their budgets got cut, and then, what was it, the second or the third one?  You could see the Halloween mask.  Oh, it was just horrible.  Even in the background of the first one, they would, their primary players would have the  good makeup on.  Amazing makeup.  It would take hours.  Right.  But in the background, we're just plastic mask guys, and you could see, they're just 
[02:53:30]  like, a little hole for the mouth.  It was terrible.  In the making of, they said, though, as the movies went on, they really had a tough time.  Yeah, you know.  And the mask looked horrible.  Makeup.  Hey, we should show Louie, maybe you've even seen it.  What was the movie?  Back to the Future, the Western one, where the kid's like, my dick.  Remember that?  Oh, he touches his dick.  And I can't.  That's a weird one.  That is odd.  I don't know what this fucking kid was thinking.  The best explanation that I've heard for this was that he had to piss and was trying 
[02:54:00]  to get the attention of somebody else.  But they left it in.  That's the best.  Have you ever seen this?  No.  They don't find a fact.  Punch that up.  Yeah, because that isn't even like a continuity or film.  It's a very strange thing.  It has nothing to do with the movie.  The kid just does it.  It's one of Doc Brown's kids when they come back on the train for some dumb reason.  He said the time machine was bad and had to be destroyed, but he made one out of a train.  Well, that's what, when they make sequels of stuff a lot, they know they're getting people 
[02:54:30]  to see it because of the earlier ones, so they don't even, they go like, do we really  have to try?  Yeah.  We don't have to try.  Do we have to reshoot that?  Yeah, let's just use that.  Not really.  Especially the, it's like, we know we're not making another one of these.  Yeah.  As Danny finds that, I got something else.  Am I going to be able to hear it?  Oh, is this it?  Oh, yeah.  There he is.  And burn!  Really?  She got the, it's the blonde kid.  I brought the snowpack.  It's the little blonde kid.  Now it's your race.  Of course it's a race! 
[02:55:00]  But what does that mean?  All right.  It means your future hasn't been written yet!  No one's had!  He's pointing at his dick.  The future is whatever you mean!  At first he goes, come here, come here.  I hope they go back to it for a slow-mo.  There we go, look.  He's going like this.  He goes, come here.  Boom!  And then he goes, come here, come here.  Come here.  What?  And then he goes, boom.  And then he starts pointing at his dick.  My dick! 
[02:55:30]  This video ends with, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  Louis, what is that?  A kid that probably has to pee?  Or is he being...  I think he's trying to tell his mom I need to pee.  I need to pee.  Because his mom's right off camera.  Yeah.  I need to pee.  Kids do that all the time.  When you're shooting with kids.  They just, they don't give a fuck.  They don't care about the shot.  Hold it in, you fuck.  A great performance is going on.  You're in the background.  I don't care.  They felt like they had to leave it in there, though.  I mean, someone had to have picked up on it.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Because, is that the real, that's blown up? 
[02:56:00]  Or is that the...  That's, well, yeah, I think the second and this is blown up.  Because there's, there's a fucking, look at how much, look at the, let me see the wide  shot.  Let me see the wide shot, the original shot of it.  Look how much is going on here.  Yeah, there is a lot of shit.  Stop on the shot of the kid.  Stop.  All right.  You've got a fucking dog.  That has to be, and you have two children.  This woman, fucking Lloyd, what's his name?  Christopher Lloyd.  Christopher Lloyd probably was like, he came out of his trailer and would be like, we  got fucking 40 minutes with him. 
[02:56:30]  And then he's leaving.  That's probably the back of Michael J. Fox's head.  There's just so much goes...  There's spinning steam machines.  Yeah, there's that thing of, there was something wrong with every take.  It's probably...  There's one take where the dog was licking Christopher Lloyd's ass.  There's one take where the kid on the left was looking right at the lens.  Yes!  There's some editor somewhere who was like, we're leaving, we're going to use the fucking  shot. 
[02:57:00]  We've got to use the dick touch shot.  Of the kid saying, I've got to go to the bathroom.  It's not like people could freeze it at home again.  Play it again.  That's amazing, though, that the kid, and with the music, once you have all the trappings  of the scene...  Yeah.  It means...  What is he doing?  My dick.  And then he does look at the lens, flashes the lens.  He looks right at the lens.  And then he's going to say something.  I think he's going to say something.  He does.  I think they cut...  Go back to the right again.  Go back to the full shot again. 
[02:57:30]  This is the weirdest scene.  He does this.  He points at his dick.  He looks at the lens.  Your future is whatever you make it.  And then he looks up, and his mom probably goes...  And he's going...  I have the pee-pee.  I have the pee-pee.  Yeah, he was about to talk.  He was ready to talk.  He's definitely mouthing something.  Oh, wow.  The future is whatever you make it.  For making that good one.  Both of you. 
[02:58:00]  He had a piss.  So weird.  The kid had a piss.  What are you going to do?  Isn't that a weird one?  It's really strange.  Dumb kid.  Let me go to Bill in Brooklyn.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was watching a show, and they were interviewing Shirley Temple, and she was told about when  she was a kid, she filmed a movie that took place in Africa, and there was a part of the  movie where the kids, these little black kids got to run down a hill, and they're supposed  to fall.  So in the scream action, they tell the kids to run down, and there's a guy at the bottom 
[02:58:30]  of the hill with a rope, and he pulls the rope, and so the kids purposely fall down.  And she talked about how they will fucking cry, and everything else, and they'll cut  up.  I found it hilarious, but she says that's what we've done with equal rights in the 60s.  Wow.  Yeah.  Boy, to have been able to do that.  Just imagine what you could do.  Yeah, I mean, I do that to actors.  Sometimes you don't tell them what's going to happen, because you want to get a natural  reaction.  Oh, right.  But it's a boy to be able to do that to kids, yeah.  The greatest behind the scenes I ever saw was for Close Encounters with working with kids, 
[02:59:00]  because that little kid, how they did the scene where the aliens are coming into the  house, and the kid's looking around, all freaked out, and then he looks at what you perceive  as one of the aliens, and he starts, first he's startled, and then he gives this puzzled  look, and then he starts smiling.  Yeah.  And it's like, how the fuck did you get a kid to do that?  And they showed how it was done with a friend that he had made on the set out of one of the 
[02:59:30]  grips or something, and he was dressed in a gorilla suit in a box.  So when the kid walks into the kitchen, he hits his mark and looks, he sees a box in  there, and then the box top comes off, and there's a gorilla.  So he steps back all startled, and then the friend took the gorilla head off and smiled  at the kid, and the kid went like, hey, and starts smiling.  Yeah.  Wow.  And the way it's done, you look at the shot and go, that kid just looked at a fucking  alien. 
[03:00:00]  You know?  And he was startled.  He did it.  And it was all Spielberg.  It was all fucking Spielberg's idea.  To put it in the box and get this reaction from this kid.  It was amazing.  Spielberg was...  He was the best with kids.  He'd always have those little Spielberg kids with their little Spielberg kid haircuts.  If you look at the DVD from Jaws, there's this horrible thing where there's a guy who  gets bit in half, and he's holding a kid, and the shark is pushing him through the water,  and he's in the shark's mouth holding a child. 
[03:00:30]  Because he's saving the child, even though he's being eaten.  Yeah.  And they cut it.  It was just too gross.  It was too gross.  They fucking cut it.  Holy shit.  It's in the DVD.  You get to see a shitty one shot of it.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, I've seen some of the extras on that one.  I don't remember seeing that one, though.  Some even modern movies, like Mel Gibson's movie, The Jesus One, The Passion of the Christ.  He's wearing a fucking suit of torn flesh.  Like, by the time you get to the point where his body's been torn up, the only way to do 
[03:01:00]  it, like, he can't lacerate into a body.  So they put a skin suit over him.  If you look at those scenes in the movie, they put a skin suit over him and then cut  that up.  And he looks like fat.  He looks like heavy.  He's a little heavier.  Yeah, because it's Jesus put on a little weight during that walk.  It looks like, yeah, Jesus.  I think of the walk he gave.  Jesus, what the hell's going on?  There's some crunches, Jesus.  He's got kind of, like, love handles.  Love handles.  Let's go back to Indiana Jones. 
[03:01:30]  I do remember this one.  Doug, go ahead.  Hey, you were talking about Indiana Jones earlier.  When he gets dropped into that tomb place and there's all the snakes on the ground.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he's staring at that cobra.  There's a piece of glass between Indiana Jones and the cobra.  And you can clearly see his reflection in the glass.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  In the later versions, they CG'd that out.  They got rid of it?  They actually got rid of his reflection.  But, yeah, he was facing off with a cobra right when he falls. 
[03:02:00]  And they said they meticulously went through to clean this fucking glass to make sure you  didn't see a spot on it.  And there's his reflection in the fucking glass.  Wow.  There's a few movies where if you freeze DVD frames, sometimes people cut right on the  hairy edge, like, right before something happens.  Oh, something happens.  Yeah, yeah.  But you can see on Dr. Strangelove, there's a scene with George C. Scott in the war room.  I don't know how well you remember the movie.  But he gets upset and he starts running over to these guys to make a point. 
[03:02:30]  And he falls down and he, like, rolls over, head over heels.  And then he gets on one knee and says something.  It's a really weird moment.  And if you cut right before they cut away, I mean, if you freeze, you see him start, everybody  starts to laugh.  Oh, really?  Like, he fell down during a take, and then he said his line anyway, and then everybody  bursts out laughing.  He starts laughing.  There's one frame of him breaking character. 
[03:03:00]  Because they wanted every second they had.  Yeah.  So, when you cut a frame of a movie, you burn a frame.  When you cut actual film, you have to destroy a frame.  So, sometimes they end up having to leave one end of the wall.  Because it's like you have to cut in twos, you know?  So, if they cut further back, they would have lost too much.  They would have lost part of the scene.  And so, they got to leave the other one.  Yeah.  So, they had to leave a little bit.  Oh, shit.  But watching it projected, you would have never seen it.  You could probably find that.  Oh, that's cool.  It's a funny moment to see. 
[03:03:30]  I love that.  Because they're just some of these huge major motion pictures.  Yeah.  Little suck-ups.  Whoopsie.  That's great.  Animal House.  No way did they have film flubs in Animal House.  Of course.  I like the, one of my favorite scenes in Animal House is when Flounder's bringing his  chicken, his hot girlfriend, and he's just a fat mess.  And he brings it through the door, shuts the door.  A beer bottle is launched.  And I'm sure it was a prop bottle, but it's coming so fast. 
[03:04:00]  And it hits her right on the top of her ponytail.  And she turns her head like, holy fuck.  I mean, it's a real reaction.  It just missed smashing her directly in the face.  Wow.  So it must have been real.  Yeah.  It hit her ponytail.  She turns her head.  And even Flounder kind of looks like, holy shit.  And they just continue walking.  But I don't think it was meant to get that close to her head.  Well, this guy actually might have a good angle on Animal House.  I was joking with him.  But Brian, go ahead. 
[03:04:30]  I love you.  Love the show.  There is a scene with Dean Warmer and the mayor.  It's right at the end where they're having that parade.  And there is an old curmudgeon in the background.  Oh, yeah.  Making faces.  Yeah.  Did you see that guy?  Yeah.  I was back in college.  You absolutely lost my mind.  I thought it was a funny thing.  I've never seen this.  There's a guy in the background.  And he's like.  He's blinking and making weird faces.  Can you find a king of comedy? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, King of Comedy.  Oh, oh.  Fucking Maury from Maury's Wigs.  Maury is in the boat behind him.  Behind him in the restaurant.  Matching all of his gestures.  Yeah, making fun of him.  And matching his gestures.  He's out of focus.  Yeah.  And he's doing all of the same gestures.  As Rupert's talking to the chick.  Yes.  He's making.  He's like mocking Rupert by imitating him.  And it's Maury from Maury's Wigs from fucking Goodfellas.  Who's not an actor, really.  He's just a realtor that De Niro knew.  Hey, hey.  And he threw him in the movie.  It's okay. 
[03:05:30]  So why was he doing that?  I don't know why.  I don't know why that's in there.  Of course, he did that.  Why was that in there?  It's hilarious.  It's one of the strangest things I ever saw in a movie.  There is a scene in Batman, the one that Danny DeVito plays the penguin.  The penguin is going to visit his parents' grave.  And he's walking through a cemetery and all the headstones are wobbling.  Because they're just shitty styrofoam.  And they're all fucking wobbling.  And then he disappears, by the way. 
[03:06:00]  He disappeared.  Yeah, I just thought that.  He's only in a few takes.  He's only in one take.  So whenever they use that take.  But they go back and forth.  No, he'll be in there yet.  And the over-the-shoulder shot, he disappeared.  He was there already.  You see him arrive, though, and then you see him start laughing and leave.  Like, after he gets bored of doing it.  This is so weird, man.  Where is it?  Was he in the earlier part of this?  Skip ahead.  Yeah, skip ahead.  He's gone through his autograph book.  There he is.  There he is.  Okay, so now he's sitting there and he's clearly watching him. 
[03:06:30]  And he's trying to keep himself in the frame there.  Yeah, yeah.  He moved over.  Yeah, Rupert's showing out the autograph book and bragging about celebrities.  That he has met and got autographs from.  And then Maury from Maury's Wigs just starts imitating him.  Yeah, here we go.  Ready?  I think it starts now.  Yeah, because you see she's kind of like, eh, well.  But why would Scorsese do this?  I'm not sure why.  Come on, come on.  That's good. 
[03:07:00]  If I ever meet him and get to interview him, I want to ask him about this scene.  It's the only thing I want to know about.  It's the only thing I want to know is why did you put him in there mocking him over his shoulder.  He's moving over knowing he'll be in.  He starts smiling.  And he's completely, you know, he's not in focus.  He's kind of in the background there.  Yeah.  Looking right at the two of them.  Yeah.  Might as well turn up a little volume maybe.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Do you think he was just on set and thought he wasn't? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, well, he was a friend of De Niro.  And it thought he wasn't going to be in the scene?  No, there's no way.  No, there's no way.  You're fucking looking at.  And he's making fun of.  You're shooting the scene.  Nobody doesn't see him.  He's so prevalent in the frame.  I don't understand that at all.  Boy, this takes a lot longer than we remember.  I know, right?  Rupert Pupkin.  We're in overtime anyway.  Who cares?  Click your head a little bit.  No.  Rupert Pupkin.  Pupkin. 
[03:08:00]  Take this as a gift.  I could watch the scene anyway.  Here we go.  Yeah, I know.  It's fantastic.  You're shrink?  That's very funny.  No, Jerry Langford.  That's right.  The Jerry Langford.  He's going to start now.  Yeah, yeah.  Would you believe it?  I think he's been listening to his bullshit.  But you're looking at the...  There you go.  Yeah, yeah.  He starts mimicking his body movements.  A guy can get anything he wants as long as he pays the price.  Love this movie.  Goddamn.  What's so funny about that? 
[03:08:30]  I mean, crazier things have happened.  What is he doing?  He's shaking his head.  He's fucking...  I've never seen this before.  Yeah.  A bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a whole lifetime.  A shot at a free ticket on the comedy circuit.  A comedy show of my own.  He's just...  Why is this in the movie?  I have no idea.  Yeah, I'd love to know why.  And we'll keep it sweet at the sharing.  And then he just gets up and leaves.  Way up top so we can look down at everybody and yell, hey, tough luck suckers.  Better luck next time. 
[03:09:00]  And he doesn't walk past them.  He just walks away behind them.  That is the oddest...  Isn't that strange?  Oddest for two or three gestures.  Has it ever been explained?  I've never.  I don't even know if the YouTube people even comment on it there.  It's just one of those weird little things he just decided to do it.  It's funny.  It's fucking funny, but it's weird.  I don't know what made him do it.  Well, Scorsese's a little bit trippy, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little strange.  Like Mean Streets, which you should go back and watch. 
[03:09:30]  You haven't seen that in a while.  It's so good.  But there's really...  You know, it's a scene about these kind of like scrappy mobsters in the Greenwich Village in the 60s.  But then there's a scene where a guy goes, hey, come into my...  This guy that owns the bar, he goes, come to the basement.  I want to show you something.  He has a tiger in a fucking cage that he bought.  And they're all like, what the fuck are you doing with this tiger?  And it's kind of a funny scene.  But then he gets in the cage with the tiger and he starts hugging the tiger.  And it gets really quiet. 
[03:10:00]  And they all just stand there staring at him.  And he's like hugging this tiger and like talking to it softly.  It's a really intense scene that makes no...  That makes no sense in the movie.  In the context of the movie, yeah.  That's so fucking odd, man.  Let's get Louie out of here.  Let's get us out of here.  Which means we get to start our own wiki.  Louie, always a pleasure.  Holy shit, it's Friday.  Oh, by the way, I will be on Red Eye this evening.  With Andy Levy is hosting. 
[03:10:30]  Because I guess Greg Gutfeld has something more important than his own fucking show to do.  He's on our show next week.  Oh, is he?  We did a scene that takes place on Red Eye.  Oh, really?  So we shot it on the set.  And Greg is in it.  And he was great.  Yeah, Greg is really good.  I like Greg.  Andy Levy is hilarious, too.  So the guy that does the mid-show and end-of-the-show wrap-up.  He's hilarious.  And he's great.  You're going to do that tonight?  Yeah, I'm doing that tonight. 
[03:11:00]  I'm not sure, because usually when Andy hosts, DeRosa does Andy's part.  So maybe DeRosa's on?  I'm not sure I might bump into DeRosa tonight.  I'm not sure.  But yeah, I'll be doing that tonight.  Set your DVRs, because it's three in the fucking morning.  We got a last-minute call to do Fallon last night.  Yeah, last night, but it was so last-minute.  I was playing golf.  He was shooting guns.  I'm shooting.  And they're calling us going, can you be back in the city in an hour?  I'm like, what?  No.  Sorry.  I'm kind of bummed, though.  And I got to go get my herded.  Hopefully they'll call us and reschedule.  I'm sure they will.  I gots to get my her done. 
[03:11:30]  I gots to go to Johnson Hall.  Get your her done?  Get my herded at the Beauty Perler.  Well, Louie nominated for four Emmys.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Thanks for coming.  I love you coming, Matt.  Thanks, guys.  It's just fun talking.  We blew off everything.  I'm very sorry about last time I overslept.  Oh, yeah.  We figured that's the last we were going to see of Louie.  Yeah, it was a total mistake, because I'd just gotten an iPhone, which I hate, and I'd  set the alarm. 
[03:12:00]  I didn't know how the alarm worked.  But we're such insecure assholes.  Like, say, another guy.  Say, fuck it.  Another guy.  Who would do it that way?  Schedule and then...  You know what I'm going to do?  The way I'm going to send a signal is to schedule and then go, oh, sorry.  Get the message, asshole.  But immediately...  Get the message.  Immediately, we don't even think about the relationship we have.  Yeah, see another guy.  Years of you coming on, having fun.  Yeah, but on the road with you guys.  Yeah, on the road.  And then one time, he's like, yeah, I woke up late. 
[03:12:30]  I missed the show.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, fucking Louie's too big for the show now.  Yeah.  No, why?  Because we are assholes, Louie.  You know why?  Because we know in this world, this media world, we're shit.  Radio is shit.  Everybody in this business is like that.  Last time I was here, I was waiting for Roland downstairs for 12 minutes.  And then I just went, fine, I'm going home.  I guess I don't matter like I used to here.  This used to come right down and get me.  Fine, fuck it then.  Fuck it. 
[03:13:00]  I'll go home then.  Just a baby.  We're insecure assholes.  Yeah, it's the worst.  We're barely holding on to this relationship on both ends.  Horrible.  It's just horrible.  What's going on?  All right, Louie.  Yeah, Louie.  Fantastic again.  Thanks, guys.  Enjoy the rest of your summer.  Yeah, you too.  We'll be watching Louie on FX Thursday nights at 1030, of course.  First season is available.  It's hilarious.  And Louie's got a bunch of dates in New England.  So go to...  Something.com.  Where do they go?  Well, Louieck.net, I think, has my tour dates on it. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  And Leatherman on Thursday.  What?  Oh, I'm doing Leatherman on Thursday.  Yes, sir.  Wow, you understood that?  We have a hard time understanding Roland.  We don't speak Roland yet.  I thought he said Leatherman Thursday.  Yeah, Leatherman.  And I had no idea what that meant.  I thought it was a movie you were filming or something.  I didn't know.  They're making a movie out of the Leatherman.  Yes, Leatherman.  Leatherman.  Opens Friday wide.  It's a very good knife that gets rusty.  Yes.  All right, guys.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Louie, thank you.  Bye-bye.  The Opinion Show on The Virus Sirius XM. </pre>
