<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  It began with a discussion of a previously aired segment concerning a woman mistakenly pronounced dead, immediately transitioning into promotion of "Whip Them Out Wednesday," encouraging women to flash their breasts to drivers displaying "WOW" signs.  Listener-submitted photos from this segment were also highlighted, available online.  The hosts then extensively covered the Winter Olympics, focusing on figure skating and mocking the perceived "gayness" of male skaters,  along with criticizing judging bias in pair skating.  Their commentary also included homophobic and sexist remarks about various Olympic events, athletes, and personalities like Bob Costas.  A caller's anecdote about viewing the Olympics while simultaneously thinking about a picture of Stephanie McMahon's nipple further fueled this discussion, touching upon various racial and sexual orientation stereotypes.  A news story about a reckless joyride in Manhattan was briefly mentioned.  Numerous callers contributed to the discussion, including Jay from Philly, Doug from Springfield, Grimace, Marley, Mike, Tom from D.C., Matt, Candice, Tasso, and Scott Farrell (a co-host from another show).  Sound clips from Tom and their New Orleans affiliate station were played, and online content like the "WOW me" section of Foundry Music and the "Naughty Nighty" contest were promoted.

The show then shifted to a news story about two men expelled from a transatlantic flight for allegedly smoking crack and engaging in sexual activity in the airplane bathroom.  The hosts' commentary was highly sexually suggestive and speculative, with one host accused of repeatedly reaching into his pants. The Air Force's unusual response of escorting the plane with fighter jets was also noted. This transitioned into a lengthy discussion about the upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge," detailing past challenges involving substances like fish guts, sour milk, and cockroaches.  The hosts solicited listener suggestions for even more disgusting materials for the upcoming challenge, including a "Bukkake Barrel," and played audio clips from previous challenges.  Listeners, including Kim (who proposed a headstand and mustard application as a qualification) and Shannon (suggested to fill her bra with chum), offered themselves as contestants and suggested various repulsive substances, including spoiled baby formula and pig's blood.  The segment included tangents on Jim Norton's stand-up tour and the "Naughty Naughty Contest," with Ron and Fez mentioned as upcoming guests. The language throughout was highly vulgar and sexually explicit.

The following segment began with a discussion of a possibly macabre event (possibly a shooting) and a reminiscence of a Barney the Dinosaur slaughterhouse bit, followed by a graphic description of the slaughterhouse process.  A caller, Dan, recounted accidentally giving his girlfriend chewing tobacco-laced soda, offering his spit tobacco as an entry for the "55-gallon drum challenge." The conversation then shifted back to the Olympics, featuring racially charged jokes about the participation of different racial groups in summer versus winter sports, referencing controversial comments by Jimmy the Greek.  Angry Angel, a caller, added further racially charged commentary about Hispanic representation in the Winter Olympics.  The hosts then discussed leading causes of death for different racial groups, using offensive stereotypes.  Calls from "Old Dirty" and others followed, engaging in racially charged exchanges and offering suggestions for the 55-gallon drum challenge, including using homeless people's underwear. The video game *State of Emergency* was discussed, and Brother Joe's vulgar Valentine's Day song was played.  The segment concluded with further discussion of racial stereotypes and the video game.

The final segment began with a brief discussion of Brother Joe's upcoming performance and the "55-gallon drum challenge." The main focus shifted to Earl, a co-worker who spent the day playing pinball, leading to a lengthy, offensive monologue filled with racial slurs and stereotypes. This transitioned into a debate about the merits of various bands, with Norton expressing controversial opinions and using offensive language.  The "FU Line" and "What Did We Learn?" segments were included, featuring angry and offensive messages and humorous, offensive observations from callers, including a recollection of an offensive question asked to Pete Best.  The segment concluded with a chaotic discussion involving Bucky, a sales representative, and the hosts' angry response to his complaints about a proflowers.com giveaway, ultimately resulting in the giveaway being fulfilled.  The show concluded with announcements of upcoming events and mention of a female contestant for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and callers frequently used highly offensive and racially charged language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  That was the, um, the eighth line of the day yesterday.  That was when we were talking about, uh, that woman that was pronounced dead.  And, uh, or was that the day before yesterday? Wow.  That was two days already.  Yeah.  And, uh, you had said, we have audio of, um, the, uh, EMT worker that pronounced her dead.  And play that clip of him.  We're going, my bad. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, Tom.  My bad.  That slayed me.  My bad.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including.  Where?  Sacramento, California.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  For the newer cities, it's, uh, a fun little thing we like to do.  So, coming on board, kind of had a season for Whip Them Out Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  But, um, you should see what happens in the spring and summer in the New York area.  You'll, you'll love it.  We're hanging low a little bit as far as Whip Them Out Wednesday goes.  But, basically, uh, it is happening.  It happens all year long.  It doesn't happen just on Wednesday anymore, but we kind of celebrate on Wednesdays.  And, uh, basically, if, uh, if you see a guy or a girl driving around town with a little  wow on the back of their car, whether it's a bumper sticker that one of the stations made  or a homemade wow sign or something written in the dirt. 
[00:01:30]  In the dirt on the back of a truck.  Doesn't matter.  That means, uh, that person in that vehicle would love to see your lovely boobs on the  way home from work today.  Yeah.  Maybe had a stressful day and all of a sudden you're driving, you got the wow on your car  and you look over and there's a lovely young lady showing her breasts.  Right.  When spring hits, we'll be, uh, we'll be, uh, spending a lot more time on it.  We'll, uh, we'll be, uh, hearing from people that are seeing stuff on the highways and the  byways.  But, uh, it's winter, so we're kind of downplaying it a little bit.  But know, know what you can do, which is very cool, especially for the winter months. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  So I'm very distracted.  We'll get to why I'm distracted in a second here.  Let me just finish my thought.  Oh boy.  Because of my short term memory problem, I want to get all this info out.  Uh, you go to foundrymusic.com.  The link to foundrymusic.com is off opieandanthony.com if you can't spell foundrymusic.com.  Uh, there's a wow me section that is starting to explode, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Steve is getting pictures, uh, weekly now from girls all over the country flashing their lovely boobs.  It's in their abode. 
[00:02:30]  Isn't that wonderful?  With homemade wow signs and stuff, proving that they're doing it for the radio show.  Uh, so that's a lot of fun to check out all the new wow me shots every week.  There's one girl that's up there now from, uh, she listens to us through the Chicago station,  but she's from like, um, I don't know, on the outskirts of town, way on the outskirts of town,  maybe in another state.  And, uh, wow, her pictures are real nice.  Well, good.  Check them out in the wow me section.  Jim Norton, what's the problem?  What seems to be the problem?  I'm looking over there.  Jim is pacing, he's smacking the mic and gritting his teeth.  I'm trying not to be, I really don't mean to be distracted. 
[00:03:00]  I'm really tempted to throw this Brooklyn Diner ice latte, which stinks, across the room.  What's the problem?  I did want regular coffee, because I wanted a Starbucks ice latte.  I know, I sound like a, that's what I like to drink.  I need my caffeine.  Right.  And then John was going to go, but I'm like, you know what?  Everybody else is going to Brooklyn Diner.  I'm not going to send the guy to Starbucks.  Jesus, who cares?  Everybody goes, I'll get a regular coffee.  Because they're iced lattes.  Oh, Jesus, there it goes.  They're terrible.  You know, we all have problems.  We really do have problems. 
[00:03:30]  You know that the poor interns around here have to go to like three or four different coffee places  because everyone has their favorite place?  I'm easy.  I don't want to get caught up in this.  No, you're not easy.  I am right downstairs at the Brooklyn Diner.  I like their coffee.  I get a regular coffee.  It's the same thing every day.  If he goes to Philips or Europa or Starbucks, then you have the problem.  No, because me and Ben like Brooklyn Diner coffee.  I don't mind Brooklyn Diner coffee, but it's not my fave.  Well, their lattes stink. 
[00:04:00]  That's not what you wanted.  No, I know it's not what I want.  I wanted a regular coffee because their lattes are terrible.  I'm like, all right, I'm regular coffee.  So it's a nice, awful iced latte.  This latte is awful, love it.  I know, I know.  I remember the days when Jim Norton was just happy to be here.  Ah, yeah.  And now look at him with the attitude.  Happy to be here.  I just need caffeine.  You know, I have to, I can't.  Pretty soon he's going to be eating a baked potato.  What happened to you?  Intern's going to have to make it just right.  Guys, I'm so happy for the airtime.  Thanks. 
[00:04:30]  You want me to drink from your mules?  God, I'm so appreciative.  Yeah.  Now look at you.  Someone says you look like Uncle Fester on chemo, by the way.  Oh, stop it.  Oh.  My God.  You all right?  Is your bagel okay?  Yeah.  I need caffeine to function.  You know, even on the road.  Right.  I'm like this on the road, too.  I go by.  I don't mind buying.  I just, I need caffeine to function.  But you came in with coffee.  So you should have enough caffeine in you.  I don't.  I need more.  I got a few hours of sleep and I need caffeine.  All right. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Aunt wanted to start with the Olympics.  Yes.  Yes.  Did you catch any of the Olympics?  I was checking it out a little bit.  First of all.  But my Islanders kicked the ass of the Flyers last night.  How about that?  They're going into their little Olympic break now, aren't they?  Yeah.  That's what the Olympics are effing up the whole NHL season, which is not making me happy at all.  Flyed in a nation, I think, can, uh, Islanders, big victory, one, one to nothing, scoring with seven seconds left in the game. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  Very, very big Islander win there.  Well, seven seconds left in, uh, OT, I think.  OT, yeah.  Anyway, so I was, uh, busy with the hockey game yesterday.  And I was busy watching, uh, uh, Jordan, uh, play, uh, the Lakers last night, Anthony.  You know, I'm a big Hoops fan as well.  All I know, you know, I know nothing, I know nothing about basketball.  And I mean that.  I mean abso-effing-lutely nothing.  Yet, I know the Knicks suck and stink.  And I know nothing, I swear I know nothing about basketball.  But you know what? 
[00:06:00]  I'm a huge Knick fan.  I know.  And I can accept that because, uh, I said it right here on this program about, uh, two years ago now.  That the Knicks needed to, to get rid of Ewing.  They were never going to win a championship with Ewing.  Yeah.  And they needed to turn the corner and go through a couple light years to rebuild.  These are the light years?  Oh, yeah.  And get back on the track of, uh, possibly getting a team together that could, uh, you know, win us a championship.  Can do something.  So I'm, uh, I'm okay with that.  Ah, right.  Not happy, but I'm okay with that.  I understand what's going on there.  And that's all I know, though, about basketball. 
[00:06:30]  But, uh, are you seeing the news now?  Everyone talking about, I came in, uh, and talked about how the, uh, Canadian, uh, pair skaters were raped by the Russians, uh, and the judges.  And what is it now?  It's a huge controversy exposed right here on this very program.  Anthony's Olympic Report sponsored by...  Now it turns out...  Fag TV!  There are some alligators being floated. 
[00:07:00]  Sponsored by...  Some alligators!  Some allegations.  Ah, what's going on with the, uh...  Well, Opie, get this now.  The judges are being criticized, and this happens every Olympics, and it's never been taken care of.  The judges vote in blocks.  This isn't supposed to happen.  The former Soviet Union, all those little piss-ad poor countries, all vote together for the Russian skaters. 
[00:07:30]  Like they're a, like they're a Soviet Union again, or still.  You know?  They're not based on the merit of the skaters and what they're seeing.  They will jack the score up for any former Soviet bloc country that's skating.  On the other hand, the Western blocs are no, uh, no more innocent.  They, they will, uh, vote for Western countries and, uh, vote against the Russians.  With the paired skating, it was obvious that the Canadians beat the Russians.  It was obvious. 
[00:08:00]  Everyone knows it now.  They've shown replays side by side.  You know who agreed with you, by the way?  What faggot was that?  Ah, Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh, great!  So you got something in common with Rosie O'Donnell, Anthony.  Great, great, great.  How was the Zima last night?  Fabulous.  They showed, uh, they showed side by side.  I hope you spiked it with vodka to look cool, at least.  Yeah.  All right.  That kills the pain of the man junk in your balloon knot, too.  They showed a side by side of some of the, the really hard moves.  The exact same moves that the skaters are doing. 
[00:08:30]  And you could tell the Canadians, I mean, did a much better job.  Perfect.  So, uh, it turns out now, now this is being slowly uncovered, um, USA Today was reporting  that the French judge that really, uh, this whole thing hinged on, made a deal with the  Russian judge that if the French voted for the Russians in paired skating, the Russian  would vote for the French team in ice dancing. 
[00:09:00]  Ice dancing?  Ice, leave it to the French.  Will you be-  To give up, probably, well, you know, figure skating in the Winter Olympics is, like, the  big, that's the to-do, that's the highest rated thing, that's what everyone watches  and wants to win.  Now, the ice dancing is the equivalent of, like, the goddamn water ballet thing, or whatever  they call it, synchronized swimming in the Summer Olympics.  It's a joke.  It's a goof.  Will you be taking a peek at ice dancing?  I might take a little gander at that.  But leave it to the French to go, well, I'll give you the, uh, figure skating, but I must 
[00:09:30]  get the ice dancing.  And they, they pretty much gave up the Canadian team, uh, to, uh, by making deals, which,  just, to me, does, someone should be arrested.  It's perfect.  Is it?  The Olympics stink.  I'm tired of these foreigners and having little fun competitions with them.  I don't like it.  You don't like it.  It's the only one you can't cheat at.  You win or you lose.  That's it.  You don't have to be voted.  Are you inspired by Neil's song?  They come into America. 
[00:10:00]  The flag's unfurled.  Unfurled?  And they're like, my country, tis of thee, today, sweet land of liberty, today.  Who uses the word unfurled?  Every time the flag's unfurled, they come into America.  What's an unfurling?  I don't know.  Every time, though.  You better relax over there or Washington's going to think we're intelligent. 
[00:10:30]  No, stop it.  We like smart things down here, whore.  You're not over that whore.  Oh, I absolutely, I really hope that I'll hug you, Beatrice, savagely.  I took a peek at Peekaboo Street there.  Peekaboo Street?  Or Street, Streak, whatever she does there.  Pretty much her last chance at anything, and I don't know.  She sucks.  Looks grim, yeah.  Yeah, I'll tell you what was cool.  Those guys doing the downhill mogul combined aerial acrobatic freestyle thing there. 
[00:11:00]  Holy, yes.  That's pretty cool.  Are you going to admit that's a sport?  That's great.  Bet you a lot of those guys get high before they compete, too.  That's great.  Also, the speed skating is pretty cool to watch.  Those guys, man, they're fast.  How the hell you do that?  Although they're built like, Jesus Christ, you commit your body to a sport, because you  can't just walk around the streets and have people look at you normal.  They got these tree trunk thighs. 
[00:11:30]  Like this little chinky guy, he's walking around and then they pan out.  He's got thighs like tree trunks.  God damn it, you can walk around like that.  Looking weird.  And then, so, get this.  They go to the men's single figure skating.  That short program.  That's when I went back to the Islander game, my friend.  These guys made the guys in the paired skating look like action heroes. 
[00:12:00]  The American skaters.  Well, because the guys in the paired skating, they're with a broad.  Well, they're with a girl, so that kind of helps the gayness, right?  I don't know how, but it does.  For some reason, they don't seem as gay in the paired skating.  The single men skate, holy Jesus.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  The American who came in third so far after this short program that they did last night,  he goes out on the ice.  You watched the preliminaries, too? 
[00:12:30]  I watched the short program.  But is that the preliminaries?  And then they combine it.  What the hell is a short program?  They combine it with the long and the combined score.  What's a short program?  It's like not the long one.  It's shorter than the long one.  Yeah.  So you know the difference between the short program and the long program?  Just as the clock ticks away, it's a little shorter.  That's all I really know, Opie.  That's all I know.  Not really that.  Don't try to get me to fall into this thing where I know anything about figure skating.  I really don't.  I'm watching the Olympics. 
[00:13:00]  Watching the Olympics.  Watching the Olympics.  Opie and Firesteen.  With Bob Costas and the fake fire.  Is that so wrong, Norton?  Is that so wrong?  Well, the American guy.  And see, to my credit, I can't, I can't, I don't even know his name.  I couldn't remember it if my life depended on him.  All right.  There's a point here somewhere, right?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  He skates out on the ice.  He gets done with his short program, Opie.  Does that, you know, throwing the arms up in very gay fashion to end it. 
[00:13:30]  The music stops.  He's got to stay there for a second or two.  And then he put his hands on his cheeks and smiled and starts crying like a girl.  I was laughing so hard as my, at the time, topless girlfriend was sitting next to me watching along.  If I just have to, I have to get that part out.  Hey.  I really, because we were laughing very hard and had a lot of sex after watching it. 
[00:14:00]  Sex during the commercial.  Oh, yeah.  Had to.  You know, I'm all man.  To get the guilt out of your system.  So then the funniest part, when they go up to wait for their numbers and someone hands them like a little teddy bear,  they grab like, I got my lucky Snoopy doll.  Yeah.  And they wait for his scores.  Where are my scores?  I'm just waiting for someone to hand them like the, what was that thing called?  The, uh, the pulverizer, the big vibrating fist rubber hand that you see in the porno shops. 
[00:14:30]  I was waiting for someone to just hand them that and put a big smile on his face.  So, yeah, that's my little impression of the Olympics last night.  Very gay.  Very gay.  But, uh, guys.  I watched some of the man leaving.  Guys crying and putting both hands to their cheek.  And, yeah.  And holding their, uh, stuffed animals.  Crying with emotion.  Yeah.  All right.  It's quite a night for the Olympics.  Yeah, that's much better than watching Jordan, uh, play against his old coach for the first time.  Hey, what, what, what? 
[00:15:00]  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Jay from Philly.  I knew this was coming.  Go ahead.  F ice skaters that don't play hockey.  Islanders blow.  So did the Flyers last night.  They both had trouble hitting the net.  You know, a lot of people calling in and, uh, you know, you guys are right because I said the Islanders kicked ass last night.  Jay, that was one of the most boring hockey games I've, I've seen in a long time.  It was horrendous.  Luckily, I had a case of Heineken sitting next to me.  Yeah, and the Islanders squeaked it on the end, but barely, but it was, yeah, you're right. 
[00:15:30]  If you can call that a goal.  It was, yeah, I know.  It was a hard, it really, it really was a horrible game.  You're right, Jay.  All right.  All right, man.  Hey, you guys suck.  Norton rolls.  All right, thanks.  There you go.  Uh, Doug from Springfield, what's up?  Anthony.  Huh?  What color dress were you wearing when you were watching this?  Not for nothing, pal.  Well, you're, you're really getting into this ice skating.  It's the, I'm watching every night of the Olympics.  Is your badge getting dirtier every night?  When they're done with the skating, I watch other stuff on the Olympics.  I think it's just enjoying, uh, watching the Olympics like a lot of people. 
[00:16:00]  I enjoy watching the Olympics, uh, when it comes around there every four years.  Uh, what do you think of Bob Costas and the, and the fake fire?  Bob Costas is a joke.  He's trying to be, uh, a personality during this thing, and he's failing miserably.  I just like when they have to get these reporters to interview the snowboarders and people that  they have no, they have no knowledge of what they do.  And, and Bob Costas, uh, there was some, some bar in Vermont or whatever it was where  one of the Olympiads, uh, uh, parents owned it or something. 
[00:16:30]  And he was live on the phone with them.  They go, let me buy you a drink, everybody there at the bar.  Now, he is, he is Mr. Cardboard Man, and anytime he tries to do anything but just talk about  the upcoming events or what happened, he comes off looking like, uh, the phony he is.  We're not big fans of Bob Costas, by the way, from his interview that he did with, uh, Vince  McMahon.  Yeah.  He personally bashed us.  Bob Costas, yeah, he, yeah.  I believe abomination was a word that might have been used. 
[00:17:00]  Grimace, what's up?  You know, you know all the snowboarders gotta be big, you know, when they're going down  the mountain, but the figure skating men, how high are those guys?  Give me a break.  Why, why would they be high?  Look at the way they look.  You know what I'm saying?  The balls just hanging out, you know, all tight spandex is ridiculous.  Yeah, the spandex in the Winter Olympics in general is a little too tight for my taste.  Yeah.  A little too tight?  That's right. 
[00:17:30]  A lot too tight.  Yeah, a lot too tight.  Anthony, you like that though, right, buddy?  Yeah, that's, that's why I watch.  Your eyes are all big staring at it.  Yeah, now look, he's describing me that I'm all, you know, excited.  My eyes get all wide staring at it.  Shut up, jackass.  Please, guys.  I can tell the skater's nationality by just, uh, looking through, looking at the spandex.  Hey, we got a peeler.  Yeah, the spandex's so tight.  Why can't you sit and watch the Olympics and not be called a gay or fag? 
[00:18:00]  Some of the new technology's unbelievable.  Like the, um, uh, what was Peekaboo Street doing?  The, uh, was it a downhill or a super slalom or whatever?  And, uh, they, they show her run and they show where the other, um, skier was at the  same time she's at?  Yeah.  Yeah, they got great technology on that.  That's unbelievable.  So you can see, well, the, at this part of the race, she was actually leading over the  first place skier because they have her, the other skier almost as a ghost.  Yeah.  That was pretty, that was pretty wild. 
[00:18:30]  Then some of the camera angles they get, like on the speed skating, they have that camera  that goes around the whole rink.  Yeah.  So it's just following them side by side.  Pretty cool.  I watched the Olympics because I enjoy the goddamn Olympics.  And no, I didn't have to watch men's figure skating to bang my girlfriend.  They think like I have to get all worked up and excited watching men in order to do  anything.  Marley, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, what up?  Hey.  You know what?  I was listening to you guys yesterday and I was done because I was hearing about Stephanie 
[00:19:00]  McMahon's nipple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I went on to Foundry Music when I got home and I was checking out the nipple.  I'm like, oh my God, look, it's the nipple.  And I kind of forgot about, like, that we were talking about, like, the skate bags.  Yeah.  So last night I'm sitting there watching the Olympics and all of a sudden I'm like, come on.  And I just started dying because I was thinking about you guys.  You guys are just going to have a field day with us today.  That's hysterical.  You know something?  Did you see him cover his mouth?  Yeah.  I was sitting there watching it.  Like, you was going to spit jizz or something?  Oh. 
[00:19:30]  I'm dying.  I'm going, oh my God, look at these fags.  And my boyfriend's going, dude, what?  It's so funny.  I'm going, these guys are freaking fags.  As I was watching it, I'm thinking to myself, as I'm watching it, I sure as hell hope some  of our listeners have this tuned in.  It goes, I cannot describe the gayness of this guy on the ice.  Oh, his little curls and everything.  He's got curly hair.  And he's like, he has both cheeks and shrugs his shoulders.  He's all, it was.  He gets up on the thing waiting for his scores to come and his coach comes over and sits 
[00:20:00]  next to him.  And no one's heard him speak yet.  So he leans over and he's miked, kind of.  So you hear him just go, he goes, that's the best short feed I've ever done.  Like, the gain, the escaping steam hiss on every S that was coming out is like, gee,  it's got to be genetic because steam's going to melt the ice.  Oh, my God.  They were so gay.  That's the best short feed I've ever done.  The two Russian guys, they have this, like, big history with each other that they were 
[00:20:30]  like, their coach was like, oh, yeah, it's like having two wives.  You're torn between them.  Oh, my bad.  Jeez.  I couldn't believe it.  All right, Marley, good job today.  Right.  Very funny.  I don't know what made the air.  She was going off there.  Mike, what's going on, man?  What's up?  My two favorite crackers.  What's going on?  What's up, kid?  What's going on?  Happy New Year.  I haven't talked to you guys since the New Year.  All right.  Listen, man, listen, man.  Don't feel bad about watching soap operas. 
[00:21:00]  Don't feel bad about watching the Gay Olympics.  Brotherhood represents Anthony.  You know what I'm saying?  You know with that little Italian black thing, you know we all brothers.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  There you go.  You know what I mean?  We all the same, bro.  When you were talking about watching soap operas the other day, I was like, dang.  Because I know some pimps that watch soap operas.  You know what I mean?  Some pimps.  Hey, listen.  Hey, the hood watches soap operas.  Brotherhood, how do you think we get the girls to get involved with it?  Well, you're not working.  Hey, listen.  Just be happy I ain't in your house robbing it right now. 
[00:21:30]  I'm having my kids around.  Remember, we're the only radio show that will admit that we love stereotypes.  Yes.  Thank you.  That's right.  Because you know what?  When it all boils down to it, it's always about that penis thing.  You know what I mean?  And thank God the stereotypes aren't reinforced by actual fact.  Wait until later on we'll dip into the old newspaper and pull out some stats on whites,  blacks, and Hispanics.  And what are the leading killers of the three groups?  It's hysterical.  When it comes down to it, when it comes down to about the paper thing, I'm just happy not 
[00:22:00]  to see myself on it.  America's most...  People be like, yo, I saw you on TV.  No, you didn't.  On TV.  America's most wanted.  No, you didn't.  All right, my brother.  That's right, bro.  You know, this is the craziest city in the world, by the way.  Mike, you saw the front page in the paper today, right?  A guy decided to take a joyride in the middle of Manhattan, and he ran down 18 people.  18 people.  You know what?  And it wasn't on one block. 
[00:22:30]  No, no, he went around.  He was able to go 20 blocks downtown, back uptown, went to the west side.  That's because sister's going to run real fast, but he had a baby mother in the crab.  Unbelievable.  Have they caught this guy?  Hopefully not.  He should get away and do it again.  Hitting Chinese bike messengers.  Everyone that you want to run over, he did.  Oh, my God.  No, they haven't.  I'm a nigga do it.  They did find a wallet in the car, though, with a woman that I guess was murdered or something. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  A wallet of a murdered woman.  In Jersey.  So this guy's, you know, he's playing real version of Grand Theft Auto 3.  It's just weird because this stuff just doesn't faze people in this city.  No, we have pushed the bar, I mean, way, way up there.  It's ridiculous now.  The guy just took out 18 people.  How many did he kill?  He didn't kill anyone, though, right?  It's like, who cares?  Messed him up real bad.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry to hear it.  Glad it's not me.  All right, Mike.  All right, peace, brothers.  Peace.  I mean, there's going to have to be some serious disaster for it to turn anyone's head anymore. 
[00:23:30]  It's pretty twisted when you think about it, you know?  When you think about it, really.  All right.  Why don't we talk about that, what you mentioned?  All right, we'll talk about that.  Also, we've got to talk about the gay guys in the plane bathroom.  We've got to talk about more gay guys.  Yeah.  That's really some story.  That's a great story.  And I think we're going to get Scott Farrell on today, huh?  To talk about the Olympics.  Why not?  He'll have some observations for us.  Gay guys.  We do have hissing cockroaches today. 
[00:24:00]  Sure we do.  We do have Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  The Naughty Nighty contest continues.  The voting continues.  Make sure you vote every single day.  Go to opieandanthony.com.  We have 98 contestants.  By next Monday, we'll have it narrowed down to the top 20, and then the voting's going to get real serious.  Opie, Timothy Goebel, I guess is his name.  As the U.S.'s hopes are in Timothy Goebel, along with a lot of man junk.  As he's in third place, going into today's long program. 
[00:24:30]  So that's his name.  If you catch it on TV, it is just uber gay.  Uber gayness.  Gayest guy you've ever seen on TV.  I will say the absolute gayest guy ever.  Who was the gayest guy you ever saw on TV?  Before this?  Before this.  Ooh, that's tough.  Are we talking queens, too?  What about the guy from...  Like, not drag queen gay.  I'm just talking, there's a guy, he's gay. 
[00:25:00]  Are you talking just Olympics or all-time?  No, just...  All-time gayest gay.  I'm thinking more like sitcom gay.  I would say Jim J. Bullock.  Yeah.  Jim J. Bullock.  This guy puts Jim J. Bullock to shame in gayness.  Boy George.  No.  Too much with the dress and the makeup and stuff.  There was something about Boy George.  I mean, he was gay, but...  What are you going to say, Opie?  There was something about Boy George.  Hold them reins back.  No, he wasn't...  Easy, fella.  I could think of gay or, you know, guys on TV. 
[00:25:30]  There was something about...  I don't know what it is.  I can't explain.  I can't put my junk on it.  I can explain, but if I slip up...  Yeah, you better be in a world of hurt.  You better be in a world of hurt.  You better be shutting it down.  What's happening to the two of you?  Ah, shut up.  Come here.  Sit on my lap.  Eat your bagel, you douche.  Something about Boy George.  And yeah, well, I didn't like the figure skating, voting.  What's the matter with you guys? 
[00:26:00]  What happened to my friends?  The Olympics.  What happened to my friends?  What happened to my friends?  We don't get into playing chess.  I'm sorry.  I haven't played in a while.  You don't play video games, but you play chess.  Yeah.  End of discussion.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breaths.  Boobs.  Wow.  And E.W.  We're back with the O&A Show. 
[00:26:30]  Thanks for checking us out today.  What the...  Lots going on.  Trying to figure out who is the gayest on TV ever.  A lot of people checking in with this one.  Tom from D.C.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  First of all, I love your show.  Oh, thanks.  Why don't you tell someone for us, will you?  Oh, God.  It's got to be Richard Simmons.  Pretty gay.  Pretty gay.  I think we could get gayer than Richard Simmons, though, today.  You think so?  Yeah.  I doubt it.  I really...  Except maybe Norton. 
[00:27:00]  Let's go.  I was thinking the guy from the real world Miami, was it?  Dan.  Remember Dan, real world Miami?  Yeah, actually...  What was that magazine he got there?  Ocean Drive.  Ocean Drive magazine.  He got a job there, and he came home and was like, guess what I got?  A job with Ocean Drive magazine.  Like, the gayest.  Yeah, or maybe...  He was the gayest of the gay real world people, I think.  Will and Grace.  A bunch of people saying Jack from Will and Grace. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, I think fake gay.  And by the way, I was just busting Norton's balls.  I love the guy.  He's one of the funniest guys I've ever heard.  But he is gay.  You mean?  No, not at all, dude.  I'll toot on him once in a while just to teach someone a lesson.  You know, some lady sent an email asking me if Jim Norton really has AIDS, or is it just for the show?  But you know, Jim, if you don't know, it doesn't count.  Yeah.  Please.  How dumb are some of these people out there?  Exactly.  Of course I do.  Of course he's got it.  Listen, guys, I'll let you go.  Thanks, man. 
[00:28:00]  All right, Tom.  See ya.  Here's a guy that went to high school with Tim Gable, they're saying.  Tim Gable, yes.  It's pronounced Gable in some strange twist of fate.  His name is Tim Gable, one of the figure skaters that Ant was watching last night.  America's hopes lie with Tim Gable.  Who knew?  As he holds his stuffed animal.  Yeah.  Waiting for his score.  After his short program.  Go ahead, Matt.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Okay, Tim Gable, gay as the day is long. 
[00:28:30]  Check this, right?  All right.  Back when I was still pretending to be a Catholic, but it was in my church.  Really?  You can see it.  What?  It's a man.  Dude, dude, don't say it because.  Oh, my.  What can I say?  Well, don't worry about it.  We'll describe it.  It's a man joke.  I mean, every single word this guy said came out with a list.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable.  Well, you know, a lot of the gay guys go into figure skating.  I don't know what it is.  And apparently a mythologist.  There you go.  Second stereotype of the show. 
[00:29:00]  There you go.  I'm going to keep track of stereotypes today.  Stereotype Wednesday.  Stereotype Wednesday.  Oh, new feature for the O&A show.  Gay guys.  Enjoy the figure skating.  I got a great call.  And black guys watch soap operas because they're not working.  Just in case you're going to keep track at home.  Maybe we'll have a whole What Did We Learn at the end of the show dedicated to the stereotypes  you learned today.  Yeah, that'll be a special feature.  Special edition of What Did We Learn.  It'll be a special feature of What Did We Learn today. 
[00:29:30]  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Go on blockernot.com.  What?  There you go.  I don't know.  When you give out your website, when you try to slip it in there like that, make sure  people can understand.  I don't know.  Where would do that?  You know what, though?  If you don't know.  This is how we work on this show.  Yeah.  If you give us something, it makes the show a little more entertaining.  Oh, will it?  Then we don't mind if you plug something.  It's when you have nothing to say and then you're trying to use us for a plug.  Yeah.  Candice, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys that Christopher Lowell, he's a designer. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  And I don't think he knows he's gay because I've heard that he's married with kids.  Stop it.  All right.  You know what?  I hate to admit this, but...  You've seen it, haven't you?  Yes, because it is so over-the-top gay, you've got to take a look.  He's the...  Any man that's fabulous.  Fabulous.  And I, when we were working in Boston, would call each other before our radio show because  this stupid show was on and he was so over-the-top gay.  Over-the-top.  It was hilarious.  Isn't it hysterical?  The guy's an interior decorator.  He's an interior decorator. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  So there's another stereotype.  Yeah, another stereotype.  Gay interior decorators, gay men.  Wait, bing, bing, number three.  Gay men.  Interior decorators, gay men.  That's it.  Any man in my book that says fabulous the way he does.  I'm sorry.  Whenever they pop up on the show.  Automatically gay.  All gay guys are interior decorators.  I'll tell you, even the gayest episode I saw, Christopher Lowell's little home decorating  show.  One day he comes out and he goes, we're going to do a little marine motif, a little nautical  motif on this room today. 
[00:31:00]  And he was dressed in a little navy suit.  He's putting like, we could put the window treatments up on a piece of driftwood over the  window.  It's driftwood.  So it's like we're drifting in the sea.  This is how he talked.  And then he had a guest come on and he had a guest come on who was like a carpenter.  He's not a gay guy, you know, because carpenters aren't gay guys, Hopi.  Right.  Another stereotype.  Oh, number four.  Hold on.  Carpenters aren't gay guys.  Great men do not have the words motif or fabulous in their vocabulary. 
[00:31:30]  So he walked up in his little sailor suit to the carpenter and before he went to enter  the room, he saluted the carpenter and goes, permission to come aboard.  Yeah.  All right, guys, I got to go.  All right, kids.  The carpenter was horrible.  Bye.  My T-cell count fell just watching it.  Just watching it.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey.  I cannot think of a gayer guy than that on TV. 
[00:32:00]  But Timothy Gable, gaze him out of the water.  Gaze him out of the water.  He's that gay.  Well, it's too bad in the Navy wasn't queued up to the vocals.  Yeah, what is it?  It's so much funnier.  It's the dance mix.  If everyone wants to just get up and dance a little, we're all men.  Tasso, what's up?  There goes Norton.  He's dancing luck.  Look at you.  Old Victor Willis, the lead singer in Felipe Rose.  And now I know all the names.  Oh, you know the names of the village people.  All right.  Enough said.  I'm not gay.  Victor Willis was the original singer, not the later one. 
[00:32:30]  Cool.  Tasso.  Yes, sir.  What's up?  Listen, you guys messed up before.  There was a team that they interviewed for like 20 minutes on the speed skating.  Yeah.  And the two lower guys, the two younger guys were looking up to this one main guy.  They go, this guy's going to break records.  He's going to win gold.  Uh-huh.  He took three steps off the goddamn starting line and fell right on his freaking face.  Yeah, the guy tripped over his own skate.  Like you would think if you're a speed skater, the one thing you would know is when you're starting, 
[00:33:00]  you don't trip over your own skate.  And he did that.  Went right on his face.  That's it.  Game over.  Maybe four more years.  He started skating at five.  Yeah.  He was doing it every morning, four in the morning after school.  His parents rented the rink all his life.  Yeah, that's it.  You build up to a point.  And if you screw up, maybe you could do it again in four years.  I'm surprised more of these guys aren't committing suicide after they ruin it.  Yeah, he put his wrist that night for sure.  All right, Tasso.  Okay, thank you.  Scott Hamilton. 
[00:33:30]  We were trying to remember his name yesterday.  Oh, Scott, I don't know.  Oh, Scott Farrell checking in.  He does the morning show here at New York.  Farrell.  You dudes are evil.  Did you?  I love that action.  I think everybody's gay.  And my wife, at least she's getting some cantaloupe.  Everybody loves fresh fruit.  I'd rather have my wife doing her best friend than some dude, hardcore backyard. 
[00:34:00]  I think it is.  It's a hardcore backyard.  You never know.  I think everybody's going there.  I don't know who isn't.  How about the guy that does the weather on Channel 7 in New York?  He drives down the street with a little scarf on in the spring.  Farrell, you're watching?  There's the weather system blowing in.  I get a woody.  Hey, Farrell, you watching the Olympics?  You seeing the figure skating and whatnot?  Dude, I just wanted two figure skaters.  I got no time to watch the Olympics. 
[00:34:30]  But I can tell you, you know, I try to keep up on everything in terms of what's going on in Salt Lake with all of the Mormons.  Aren't they an exciting bunch?  What do you got to do?  Go to Park City to get boozed up?  Jesus, what's next?  I got to sing in the choir?  How about the scam of figure skating?  Yeah, that's a scam, man.  The French.  It's the dreaded French.  I think that all of the judges should be shot in the head at, like, ten paces.  I think it was just a scam. 
[00:35:00]  Everybody knows what happened.  Everybody knows that the Russians coiffed.  Everybody knows the Canadians won.  I think they did it because the Canadian dollar's worth 54 cents.  I don't know.  The fix was on.  And, I mean, how gay was all of that?  Watching the Russians stumble around and then watching that hottie Canadian chick.  How about when she was warming up?  She plucked a Russian at about 40 miles an hour and just got debriefed. 
[00:35:30]  What's her name?  Yeah, right on the ice.  This Anton Skilaludz and Jamie Saley, she's from Alberta.  You know, the Canadian Rockies.  Those girls love doing the two-step with cowboy hats on like your boy George W.  All I know is that who cares?  How about Johnny Moseley?  He got a little hardcore.  He got a little action to cucumber.  He did the dinner roll.  That didn't land.  Then he complained.  Yeah, his dinner roll.  His big move is the dinner roll.  He did a badass move. 
[00:36:00]  And I know that dude, and he's cool, but he's a walking NASCAR.  And if you lose, you should just go drink Jameson and try to do some ski bunny.  Who are you kidding?  Maybe Peek-a-Boo's game.  How about people talking about her?  She finished 16th.  I'd rather talk about my drinking problems.  Honest to God.  How about the women's hockey?  10-zip over Germany.  They're going to do the Asian bitches by 20.  Honest to God. 
[00:36:30]  And the men.  Wait, the Chinese have a female hockey team?  Female hockey.  I swear to God.  Oh, God.  They're playing them.  I haven't watched that.  How many Olympics does Cammie Granato get a play in?  She's got nine lives.  Honest to God.  How many medals do they get to win at one point?  How about the dude from Seattle?  Oh, no.  I thought that guy pitched for the Dodgers.  All I know is he fixed his race to get his buddy in, and his buddy looks like he smokes fat spleefs.  He's got reggae hair looking like Hugh Douglas down in Floralinovia. 
[00:37:00]  They love us down there down the shore.  How about the Islanders last night giving you guys something to think about in the morning?  I woke up in a good mood, but then my butt was killing me.  What happened, Floralino?  No, the Islanders beat the Flyers last night.  I was watching it.  It was a horrible game.  The guys that went to Nagano and broke all the furniture show up.  Yeah, yeah.  I love dudes that drink whiskey hard and look for pound cake at the Olympic Village.  The last time I went to an Olympic Village, I was minding my own business, topping a little 
[00:37:30]  Santana.  And then the next thing I know, I'm eight feet in the air in Atlanta, blowing up.  And then they look for the dude in the woods for 10 years, and he's smoking fat.  They can't find that guy either.  I was in the Olympic Village when the bomb went off in Atlanta, and I swear to God, I was  doing my gig.  I go, hello, everybody.  Well, I want to offer Olympic activity.  Holy mother of dripping blood.  Classic.  I started running.  First thing I did, I remember it distinctly. 
[00:38:00]  There was, in the Olympic Village, all of the people that were involved, they tried to  entice them with all of the, you know, they had everything going.  Pepsi, they had booze, they had cocktails, they had beers.  Every beer in the world.  The minute the thing went off, everybody started running for their lives.  Pharrell started filling up bags with beer.  Go back to the NBC Hotel.  Try to be logged up for the rest of the show.  I was sitting there.  I don't know.  We're digging in Berkow.  All roads are closed.  Manhattan is off.  What do you think of the snowboarders? 
[00:38:30]  Snowboarders smoke fat blizz.  And they do tricks and land.  And then they get laid by chicks with big hips.  They're all cool.  But how does a guy that's eighth in the stoner games win the gold?  He comes Pharrell out there, 15 feet.  He's up there.  Yeah.  He busts off a triple sow cow with a double indie grabber.  Flatbush City.  Yeah.  Creed, don't blame Gavin because he's beautiful.  Look at her.  She can really stink it up, can't she?  Oh, she's got big time rack. 
[00:39:00]  Look at her finish with a little cleavage.  Yeah.  Hey, Pharrell.  Did you check out the female bobsled team?  I dig chicks away on one another and just shoot down my swats.  I saw one on Leno last night.  It was a man.  They're burly.  They're burly.  You know those German chicks?  They drink, like, thick Urkel.  And they just, like, have hairy armpits. 
[00:39:30]  One of the chicks was hot and small, you know?  And then they got the bruiser that must push the whole collection of women down the mountain there.  Just this biggest woman.  It looked like China with blonde hair and bigger.  Bigger upper body than China from the WWF.  How about these, like, you know, they're trying to cram it down our throats.  And everybody's a star.  The stories, they try not to be as cheesy.  Oh, yeah.  They're getting huge ratings.  But these five, ten-minute beat-tribes about, you know,  and Carol has spent so much time away from her little puppy that she can't seem to get a grip on reality. 
[00:40:00]  I don't care about any of them.  The fact of the matter is, it's the greatest thing in the world.  It's patriotic.  Everybody's happy.  Right.  Wonderful and fine.  But let's face it.  I mean, are you going to be talking about those snowboarders in two months?  No.  And their endorsement.  You know, all I have to say is Michael Chang.  He's doing, like, tiger half-butter.  I mean, nobody...  No one remembers.  John McEnroe's doing... 
[00:40:30]  He's got leopards climbing on chicks whack on TV.  I mean, all of them, you know, what it comes down to,  who isn't whoring these days?  Oh, I can't stand those goddamn things.  I just show up and do the gig and watch you guys break furniture.  I don't have any interest in any of it.  I did, like, video games for violent lacrosse.  You can check it out, right?  And what do I do?  I watch kids bash each other with bats.  I did battle skank.  Some guy broke his ankle.  I was like, yeah, pussy!  Boom.  You know, I don't want anything. 
[00:41:00]  I remember.  I got a new Mercedes dealership for the show.  You know what they said?  As long as he doesn't drive.  Hey, what do you think of the luge?  I think the luge should be done on 15 beers.  I think that everybody should get tanked up,  and they should do it in the dark,  and then they should shoot out into a lit, like, ice chunk,  and at the bottom of the hill,  they land into a big pile of powder,  and then they get to do Swedish chicks all night to dance  and play Oopah music.  All right, with that, we're going to let you go, Pharrell. 
[00:41:30]  Dude, I want to be Olympic reporter for you freaks.  You know what?  How was New Orleans?  Did you guys get laid?  Yeah, many times.  Did you do stand-up hurls?  No, we had stand-up hurls.  Did you do 31 black on that Pharrell-O-Ret table?  No, we did have a great time, though.  Did you go over there?  Stinky went to the casino and lost some money.  Stinky loves hot rides.  He lost some.  He was shooting craps or something, wasn't he?  There's nothing quite like smelling dead sea bass while you're gambling.  Yeah, right on the water, man.  I love the sweat of that town. 
[00:42:00]  Nothing like urine and vomit in the morning.  Can I get a couple of scrambled eggs?  And can I get a different table away from this pile of hurls?  How you guys doing?  I don't even remember.  Who won the Super Bowl?  Yeah, right?  Who won the Olympics?  You know, I can't even tell with all the different hockey players  from the different teams, I swear to God.  I'm just cheering for locals.  I'm like, yeah, I got that Sikora guy.  I got five bucks on Richter.  And I'm rooting for, like, the bad teams.  I'm rooting for the teams with the coolest jerseys.  But in hockey, they call them, are you ready, class? 
[00:42:30]  Sweaters.  Sweaters.  Goodbye, fellas.  Bye, Farrell.  By the way, I drank heavily today down there at the rack place with all the wings.  I hit on 15 chicks.  I got 12 numbers.  Anytime you guys are ready to roll, I'm ready to go out and do the Mad Hatter with you.  All right, Scott Farrell.  You rock, bro.  There he goes.  That's great.  He's our morning guy here in New York.  Yeah.  Check him out.  He brought up something, though.  They should just show it.  You want to see what he was saying in there? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, part of it.  Oh, okay.  They should just play the goddamn, just show the sports, show the activities, those things  they go to.  All right, and they're clearing the ice.  So we got 20 minutes.  It started in Wisconsin with a pair of skates and a dream.  And then they show, like, the old home videos of the child skating to some of the sappiest  goddamn music.  Near, far, wherever you are. 
[00:43:30]  At 12, she was already at the top of her game.  Her parents, blah, blah, blah.  I don't care.  They should show the little fag kid when he was young.  It started with an uncle, a knuckle, and a tear-stained pillow.  And with that, that is awful.  And with that, we step aside for a little bit.  Classic.  All right, we're going to talk about the two gay guys in the plane there.  And then maybe we should switch off the track to something a little less gay. 
[00:44:00]  How many of your stereotypes have we done today?  Wow.  A lot of gay ones, though.  We're up to four.  We'll get to some black and Hispanic ones.  We did a black one already.  Did we?  Which one?  Carpenters are never gay.  Interior decorators are always gay.  Figure skating guys are always gay.  Oh, okay.  And then black guys like to watch soap operas because they're not working.  Right.  All right.  We're well on our way.  We're up to four. 
[00:44:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Make it touch her.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And EW.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow. 
[00:45:00]  Boy, I wonder who that is.  We got the latest Tom clips.  We got hundreds of them from our trip to New Orleans.  Tom, the guy that pretty much runs the station we're on in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Didn't even know we weren't on the air for the first two hours of the show yesterday.  Didn't seem to care when we called them up and tell them about it.  Check out this one from Tom.  Jesus Christ, we're in New Orleans, man.  New Orleans, man.  I used to work for the former. 
[00:45:30]  Classic rock station.  Here's my favorite one.  My wife and Rick's wife are hitting it off pretty good.  Look at them on the couch.  Look at them on the couch.  Donnelly knows what those two do.  I'm not going to drop the F-bump.  Yeah.  For the fifth time?  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, no.  Could this be a new favorite sound clip?  Yeah, that one's pretty annoying.  Let me compare it to this.  All right, at the same time, ready?  All right.  One, two. 
[00:46:30]  All right, that wastes a minute.  Monica, what's going on?  Not much.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Where are you calling from?  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  So what's up today, Monica?  We got to get some more WOW stickers out here.  The station's taking care of that. 
[00:47:00]  I've only seen two.  Just wait for the spring.  When the spring hits in most of these cities,  because I know we're in some warm climates,  WOW's going to be out of control.  Trust me on that.  I've only seen two.  That's all right.  It takes time.  They're missing my double D's.  Uh-oh.  Oh, so, Monica, you're basically saying  if you saw a WOW on the back of someone's car  in the Cleveland area,  you would definitely be flashing.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that, guys.  Damn it.  Do you need any more proof?  Exactly.  It's also saying you sent your first WOW me shot  to Foundry Music? 
[00:47:30]  Yep.  Cool.  Very cool.  That's a great section on FoundryMusic.com  if you haven't seen it yet.  Girls from all over the country  sending in topless shots.  Yeah.  It's called the WOW me section.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Monica.  Hang in there, all right?  You guys suck.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  Nice booze, but nothing to say.  Mike?  Mike?  Hello.  Mike?  Oh, whatever your name is,  it doesn't matter.  Manuel, what's up?  Oh, how you doing? 
[00:48:00]  Hey, that guy's screaming like that  I thought he was getting raped.  It's hot.  Oh, my God,  there's a prison scene going on there.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas. 
[00:48:30]  Right here.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole.  That's great. 
[00:49:00]  That's why this show is so good.  We could go with it.  Let's just have a little fun.  Other shows will sit around  and try to write witty stuff like this.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, I got one.  Hold on.  All right.  Oh, ow.  Are you ready?  Ah. 
[00:49:30]  Ow.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, ow.  Ow.  That's great.  That never gets old.  Sandy Cain.  The Sandy Cain noises never get old.  Joey, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Yo, you guys got to use the clip from Arnold.  That clip.  Oh, yeah.  Let me get that.  All right.  Let's try another one here.  Prepare those two. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Let's take.  Thanks, Joey.  All right.  Ah.  Let me get it.  Mm-hmm.  Hold on.  Where's Arnold?  Oh, there it is.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  You know, sometimes it takes time.  There we go.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  That was fun.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Ant and Tom. 
[00:50:30]  A couple good stories in the paper today.  Oh, yeah.  Did we find the story of the two gay guys?  Yes, we did.  That had F-14 scrambling.  Scrambling.  Freaking out, thinking there may be another terse attack being planned in the bathroom.  Flush the bombers, we're going to Defcon 5.  Jetliner Lust attracts F-16s.  I said F-14s. 
[00:51:00]  F-16s.  Hello, Joshua?  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Don't need a goddamn machine to tell me that.  Well, unplug the goddamn thing.  Check out this story.  Well, in a minute, as I see Randy.  Do you want to play a game?  How about a nice game of chess? 
[00:51:30]  Faggot.  Jetliner Lust attracts F-16s.  Jetliner Lust.  Sounds hot already.  I thought I was going to read a pretty cool story with a title like that.  But it says,  A Randy drug-fueled romp in a New York-bound jet's restroom sparked a mid-air terror scare that sent a pair of F-16 fighter jets scrambling, authorities revealed yesterday. 
[00:52:00]  But the red alert aboard American Airlines Flight 101 from London on Friday gave way to red faces when authorities discovered all the fuss was over two amorous British men.  Police said the passengers, whose names were not released, admitted that they were smoking crack cocaine and having sex in the cramped restroom on the plane.  Don't you listen to the rules?  Why are people...  You could have the sex.  Why are people still chancing it?  Smoking crack in the bathroom. 
[00:52:30]  When we flew to New Orleans and back, I didn't move from my seat.  I didn't even go to the bathroom.  I didn't want...  I didn't want to move.  Well, from, you know, England, transatlantic flights.  You've got to get up and take a leap.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, but you don't have to get up and do a little turd burglarizing.  Stupid moes.  The miles...  And how the hell did they get into the bathroom together anyway?  Well, check this out.  The miles-high ordeal began about 8.15 a.m. Friday on the London to New York flight.  Flight attendants complained to the pilot that the two men were acting suspiciously, making four or five trips to the restroom together. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, but the difference is, on a bathroom like that, you don't need to bring a little bag to hide your feet, because nobody else can peek under there.  No one else is there.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Or, crinkle, crinkle.  Good to do it.  Hey, hip, hip.  Here you are.  Crinkle, crinkle, then.  Crumpet, crumpet.  A captain had requested that the local authorities meet the two passengers at the gate of Kennedy.  Air Force listens in.  Why are you...  Stop it! 
[00:53:30]  ...touching yourself during this story.  I'm not actually...  I got my hand...  You got your hand down your pants.  Look, look, look, look.  That's exactly how I am.  I got my hand...  I was scratching my pubes in my hand.  I'm not touching my mule.  Opie, I look.  I see Norton with his hand down the front of his pants during this story.  I don't have a rod.  I'm packing like a half.  Jim, I've known him for eight years.  I've never seen his hand in his pants.  Not during that story.  Maybe during Teen Week.  Exactly, or watching Olympic skating.  All right.  You have your hand in your pants every day on this show.  Yeah.  I'm not playing with my... 
[00:54:00]  I never showed you my...  You take the hand out of the pants.  For those of you at home, he's doing the Al Bundy.  Kind of putting your hands down your pants.  Yeah.  Standing up.  What's the big deal?  I'm not like, you know, getting turned on.  Air Force listens in, Anthony.  Air Force officials overheard the captain's radio dispatch to American Airlines operations  and sent two F-16s to intercept a jetliner over the Atlantic Ocean.  The airplane's crew did not ask for the military escort.  The captain requested that that not happen because he didn't believe the situation was 
[00:54:30]  that serious, but it happened anyway.  The two passengers were asleep when the plane touched down at JFK and they were escorted...  Of course they were.  Tired.  ...and were escorted off by Port Authority, Customs, and FAA agents.  No drugs were found on the men who were not charged with any crimes.  Immigration officials deny them entry into the country because they admitted smoking crack  in the restroom, law enforcement officials said.  The men were put back on a plane bound for London later Friday, officials said.  That pair, Ron and Fez, from New York here, come on right after our show. 
[00:55:00]  Sad, I know.  I didn't want to have to expose that, but stop.  Bill, Bill, you're smoking crack.  Hi, Bill.  Wow.  All right.  Who knew that was going on?  And Larry wants to ask a question.  What's up, Larry?  Yo, what are you?  What's up with that girl that's going to lose her virginity tomorrow's Valentine's Day?  Virgin.  Well, our virginity contest, not going as well as the Naughty Naughty Contest. 
[00:55:30]  What happened now with her?  We got the latest info on Keisha, the virgin from Philly.  Yeah, she was supposed to call in, but I just called her at work.  She's not there right now, so...  I'm wondering if she's going to call in a little bit.  Keisha, if you're listening, give us a call.  But basically, the guy does not want to do her anymore.  My man, my friends don't want to do me because he's afraid it's going to wreck our relationship.  Oh, no.  He probably got his glasses back from the...  The optometrist.  Jeez, really? 
[00:56:00]  He doesn't want to do her anymore?  Yeah.  Ruin the relationship.  The guy says that.  He's either a skater or he's just not attracted to you.  A skater.  We never care about relationships.  I don't care about one girlfriend I have, like a female friend.  There's not one female friend that I wouldn't let blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and just ruining the friendship.  Who cares?  He didn't tell her that from a phone on an American Airlines flight from England, did he?  In the bathroom, no?  That sounds a little suspicious.  I don't think we're going to have a girl lose her virginity on our show this Valentine's Day, Anthony. 
[00:56:30]  You know, we put all our eggs in that one little basket.  Well, we had four girls that had potential.  Remember the fat psycho broad?  Yeah.  She backed out.  That was on the Prozac and stuff.  She backed out.  We got the girl from, I think it was Cleveland, that was going to let one of the New York City firemen bang her.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Don't want to help out a hero.  Yeah, we're falling short on this one.  Damn it.  That's a tough one to pull off, fellas.  Don't kick yourselves.  Well, yeah.  Tough one to pull off.  It's not like we're asking them to come here and we'll do it. 
[00:57:00]  You know, it's like, hey, you get the guy, you get the girl.  Then we had that hot girl, the teenager.  What was her name?  The Puerto Rican.  18-year-old Puerto Rican virgin?  Yeah, and then we just didn't believe it.  No one believes that.  Yeah.  What is it?  Liar, liar.  That's not liar.  Stereotype number five.  Seven years.  Ah.  All 18-year-old Puerto Rican girls are not virgin.  It's like a straight skater.  Yes.  Let me add that to my question.  No teen Puerto Rican virgins.  No.  Number five.  That's the other stereotype. 
[00:57:30]  Five for the day.  Five for the day.  Five for the day so far?  Nice.  So, I mean, do we even attempt to make this happen?  Tomorrow is the big day.  Yeah.  Ladies, I don't know.  We'll just...  We'll put the word out.  We'll just throw it out there.  We're looking for one of you ladies to lose your virginity live on our show tomorrow.  Yeah.  It doesn't have to happen in front of us.  We'll get you a hotel room and make it nice.  We just want to have you do it.  And then we'll bring you in here and talk about the experience a little bit.  Not, you know, we're not going to put a mic on you.  Right.  Unless your boyfriend's name is Mike.  And then there'll be a mic on you. 
[00:58:00]  Ho, ho.  Let me...  Ha, ha.  Huddle, huddle.  Is Mike on?  No, he's behind.  Oh, I know.  Jesus.  Man, you think quick on your feet.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, the girl's friend ain't willing to take it.  I'd be more than happy to volunteer to de-cherry her.  Well, all right.  Well, hopefully Keisha will call. 
[00:58:30]  Maybe we could work this out.  You know, I mean, because Keisha sounds like a girl in need, and I'm the type of guy willing  to provide those in need.  Keisha definitely wants to get banged.  We gave him too much time to think about it is what we did.  Yeah.  We should have had him come in here and drink, have him drink a little bit, and he'd be on  her so quick.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Hey, when is the ice going to warm up for Norton at the garden?  Because he did a lot better than that short midget did.  Well, Norton's doing his own tour, man. 
[00:59:00]  Dude, Dice killed at the garden.  I mean, I'm glad you enjoy me, man, but Dice killed at the garden.  What are you talking about?  Oh, Norton.  Yeah, Norton.  I don't know if you remember.  At the garden, he was picking on a guy in the front row with a girl with a big chest.  Every show.  And he was talking to Harley, dude.  This makes sense to everybody listening to us now.  Yeah.  Thank you, Bill.  No, thank you so much.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, Bill.  Well, this is actually audio from the cockpit of that American Airlines plane.  Cool.  All right.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  That was airplane. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Like we got to go this route again.  Well, do you want to go down this route?  I have them all lined up here.  I'm sure you do.  More audio from the bathroom on that flight there.  Yeah.  Over the Atlantic Ocean.  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  That just sound like a sweaty, gay scene going on.  Yeah.  Well, here's one of the guys picking up the other guy before they smoked a crack and went  into the bathroom there to have some of that gay sex act. 
[01:00:00]  Uh-huh.  You like movies about gladiators.  Oh, he was one of the gay guys, and he realized that he was in trouble when the FBI came up to him.  Hey!  Really?  Oh, well, one of the pilots, you know, he had to take a leak.  It's a long flight there, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  So he walked out of the cockpit there, and he went to the bathroom, and the gay guy's having  sex in there.  The door was unlocked there.  Oh, damn.  Sounding a little like Norm Macdonald.  Yeah, the door was there. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  As they set up this bit here, it's only going to be three seconds, but the setup's going to  be two minutes.  So the door was unlocked, and they're having gay sex in there, and the, you know, this  is what the pilot had to say there.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Oh, one gay guy, when he thought the other gay guy was being a little too loud, and they  might be on to him.  Be quiet, sir.  That is a gay guy.  Did you know that one of the gay guys there, it was the first time he was having some of 
[01:01:00]  this balloon-not sex act?  Yeah.  We got some audio.  Ah!  That's my new favorite.  All right.  Audio of the other guy as he's, uh, yeah, doing the deed.  You're a filthy whore!  And a gay guy in the bathroom.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yeah.  Eat it.  All right.  And the listeners listen to this.  Be more funny! 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Okay.  Hissing cockroaches?  Do we finally have them?  Yeah, we can play the hissing cockroaches.  They're lying again.  No, we're going to play the hissing cockroaches right now.  Oh, no, we're not, because Rick's running down the hall.  Oh, Rick, shouldn't that have been...  No, he'll get it.  Like, sitting there, though?  Anthony, uh, the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah.  Number two is coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  I think we want to get this, uh, happening within the next few weeks. 
[01:02:00]  Well, the first one was, uh, Scream.  What a lot of fun.  We put a bunch of girls in separate 55-gallon drums, cut little holes in them.  So, uh, not so much so they could breathe, so we could throw crap on them.  And we just put in disgusting, smelly stuff, sticky stuff.  Um, what else was in there?  Like, fish guts, uh, chum, chum, chum was disgusting.  Sour milk that we'd left on the radiator.  Yeah, and then it has...  You say radiator, I say radiator. 
[01:02:30]  As we're, uh, drinking beers and hanging out and having fun with these girls,  we were just dumping warm beer on top of their heads.  And then, uh, at one point, um...  It smelled so bad.  Yeah.  It really...  I mean, we had puke.  All sorts of crap, man.  Then we had the hissing cockroaches.  Hissing cockroaches.  We had a lot of, uh, bugs.  Well, we got a bunch of pictures, don't we?  We had the mealworms that were moving around.  A lot of the stuff you now see on Fear Factory.  I know, that's right.  Yeah, look at that.  Mealworms.  Yeah, so, we're gonna, uh, bring back the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:03:00]  But this time around, we want to make it sicker and grosser than the first one, right, Ant?  I don't know how the hell we're gonna do that.  Well, that's why we're gonna, we're gonna spend a couple weeks on this.  Uh, hopefully the listeners will help us with suggestions of things we could throw in the barrel  that's really gonna send these women over the edge, Anthony.  Maybe you should put one hole in it and let Tom just talk into it.  Ah!  Yeah, so, uh, basically the contest is we, uh, 
[01:03:30]  we, uh, put the girls in the 55-gallon drum challenge, uh, 55-gallon drums,  and then we lock them in there, Ant.  Yeah, they are bolted in.  And the only way they can get out is to pretty much scream and tell us they want out immediately.  They have to beg to get out, uh, through, they were screaming, crying, uh,  with the echo of the drum.  It's just great when they're,  Please let me out!  And they're crying.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  And the last girl standing will, uh, will win.  Yeah.  The 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:04:00]  Last girl, uh, in the barrel.  And we'll have all sorts of prizes and stuff, but this time around it's going to be,  we're going to just put it over the top, I'm telling you.  To put it over the top, we might have to do Bukkake Barrel.  Bukkake Barrel?  Bukkake Barrel.  Everyone gathers around.  That's great.  Get a good one.  We're trying to figure out if we should, uh, do this in public or not,  or just keep it to the radio, you know, keep it to the studio.  Oh, it's great.  We're going to figure it all out, though.  Just, like, whip up a bunch of batches.  Yeah, Bukkake's great.  Bukkake Barrel.  Anyway, I got the, uh, the tape of the hissing cockroaches. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, this was the, the worst, because they were live, big, hissing cockroaches that were  the size of your hand.  These things were huge.  And, um, the girls didn't know what was going in, uh, in the barrel.  We never told them it was, uh, cockroaches.  When they dropped in, they just felt their spiny, uh, legs and their spiny shells on their  shoulders, in their hair, on their backs, and they lost their minds.  Even worse, though, than feeling, uh, the, the cockroaches on their bodies was the sound 
[01:05:00]  these hissing cockroaches made.  That's why they're called...  Like a rattlesnake.  ...hissing cockroaches.  Yeah.  And they didn't know what the hell it is, because it's really dark in the barrels.  Yeah.  Really dark in the barrels.  So, here's the, uh, the clip of, uh, the hissing cockroaches.  The last time we did the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Listen to it, this is hot.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  Okay, here, here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps.  Here it is. 
[01:05:30]  This is it.  This is the ultimate.  It's over.  Okay.  Girls?  Girls?  Wait, wait, wait.  You gotta do it all at the same time.  All at the same time.  All the girls at the same time?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Okay.  Everybody?  Nobody?  No one else is gonna do it.  What do you do?  What is that?  Is that something making noise? 
[01:06:00]  That isn't somebody doing that into a mic?  No.  Listen, listen, listen.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus!  No!  No!  No!  All right, I gotta get a few more.  Remember, girls, just yell.  Wait, I'm gonna whisper into this.  Yeah, I'm whispering into the mic.  Roaches.  They're hissing, hissing roaches.  They're huge, like the ones you see on Indiana Jones.  Oh, my God, that's horrible. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, no, it's horrible.  Oh, no, it's horrible.  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  I give up.  It rubs the lotion. 
[01:07:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Okay.  Anyone want out?  Do you wish to leave?  Wendy, do you wish to leave?  No.  Oh, my God, no.  Is that true?  Hey.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Wendy, how are you?  Huh?  Oh, she's horrified.  You all right? 
[01:07:30]  I can't even talk right now.  Go to someone else.  All right.  Let's go to Jane.  Jane?  Jane?  Jane's fine.  Well, see, the merciful thing is my goggles are so fogged.  I don't even know what that was.  Oh, good.  Okay.  And Tabitha.  And Tabitha.  I just want to know what that was.  Oh, my God.  That's even more horrible.  They don't even know what it is.  Oh.  Hissing cockroaches.  Don't, please, don't tell us. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I don't want to know anymore.  Don't tell us until we get out, please.  Really?  Really, like, don't tell us.  Okay.  Don't tell them that they're...  Don't tell them.  I got to tell them.  I got to tell them.  You got to tell them.  Listen to the noise they make.  Go ahead.  Listen to the noise they make.  Rick, didn't he want to touch it?  No.  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.  All right.  I'm over here now.  I'm a hissing cockroach. 
[01:08:30]  Thanks, guys.  And there you have it.  The hissing cockroaches from the first time we did the 55-gallon drum challenge.  That is the best sound coming out of that girl.  We are looking for ladies that are brave enough to go into the drums.  That screaming is the best thing.  Because they don't know what it is.  They don't know what it is.  It's dark.  Yeah.  And then they're crawling around.  You know how spiny?  Like, they pinch you, these things, when they walk on you, because their legs are all spiny. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  There was some nibbling going on.  Yeah.  You've seen the Indiana Jones movies, right?  You've seen when he's in the caves and those huge cockroaches are walking around, those giant beetles they look like.  Do they find these things in apartments in New York, or are they from, like, other places?  I don't know.  No, they come from Madagascar.  You remember that?  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  So, it's going to be interesting, because we're going to take it to the next level this year.  Did all these block the box up?  Huh?  No, they were wearing their underwear, right? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  We made them get into the drums with their bronze hands.  I forgot about that.  That was great.  Get in the drum.  We needed hotness.  Yeah.  We always need hotness.  Yeah, so I guess they were blocking it.  But we had poured so much liquid in these things, too, in the form of beer and just ice water.  After a while, we would just pour ice water in on them out of nowhere.  They'd be sitting there in the dark, cold, wham, ice water pouring on top of them. 
[01:10:00]  And it got to the point where they were sitting in about a foot and a half of soup in the bottom of this thing,  full of floating fish eyes and living things, fish, dead fish.  You know what I think?  I think what we learned from the first one, living things, very good.  Yes.  Very good.  How are we going to get the ladies for this?  That cockroach was great.  How are we going to get the ladies this time around?  We've got to get some hardcore ladies.  I'm a snake.  Throw some hot oil on them, Stanley. 
[01:10:30]  Look at this girl that went into the...  I'm looking at some of the pictures.  You can go to what?  Oh, yeah.  Opianthony.com and go to what?  Wall of Fame.  Wall of Fame.  And this picture is from the first time we did this.  Tabitha has her little lingerie outfit on before she went into the drum.  Very hot.  And...  Oh, Wall of Fame.  There it is.  We would like to get some ladies from some of the other cities so they can represent their  city and stuff.  Yeah.  Some of the pictures from the first time around are pretty damn funny.  Oh, we almost killed them, too.  One of the first things we threw in for some stupid reason. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  We're going to need...  You know what?  Before you say what you're going to say, we definitely need some experts to help us out  with this contest this time around.  Because we found out that some things just should not be thrown in a 55-gallon drum.  Yeah.  Somebody decided it would be a good idea to throw a bag of kitty litter in.  And if you've ever seen the dust that could come off a kitty litter, the hacking and coughing  that was happening in those barrels, it almost killed them.  Yeah.  The girl's like, I can't breathe now.  Just settle down and shut up. 
[01:11:30]  Just take a little turd out of the litter and drop that in.  I know.  Cat turd.  Barbara, what's going on?  Hi.  I have a very disgusting suggestion for you.  Okay.  You take...  This happened to me once.  You take chopped meat and you fry it up.  All right.  And then you let it sit, cooked, for a couple of days.  Yeah.  It is the most disgusting odor you will ever smell in your life.  It's guaranteed sparse material.  Nice.  Really?  Are you going for the gross out of you?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  We're going...  The last time we did this, we had an open-door policy that day where we had our listeners just  coming down with their gross stuff.  And we warned them ahead of time.  And they came up with some great things, man.  Well...  Guys were going through the dumpsters at work and stuff.  And...  Oh, yeah.  So...  All right, Barbara.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So we've got to figure out how we're going to put this together this year.  But...  Yeah.  Ladies, if you're thinking about it, you know...  Ugh.  Keep listening to the Opie and Anthony show for details.  One girl was so fat, we could not fit her in a 55-gallon drum, by the way. 
[01:12:30]  That was Christy.  Yeah, Christy.  So we had to get...  You ever see the big, green, garbage-pail-shaped things that the landscapers use?  They're on the back of the truck.  They put the clippings in them and whatnot.  We had to take two of those, put her in one, take another one, put it upside down on top  of that one and duct-tape the scene where they met, because she would not fit in a 55-gallon drum.  That's not humiliating for a woman.  Well...  It wasn't fair to the other ladies that were kind of crammed into that.  Look, there she is. 
[01:13:00]  There's the picture.  Yeah, but it's still crammed in.  But at least the other ladies have some dignity walking down the street.  I guess it all comes out in the wash, doesn't it, boys?  Well, sure.  All right.  So there you have it.  It's coming soon to the O&A show.  Oh, yeah.  And it's going to be better than ever.  What is this?  Can't wait.  This is good, too?  Yeah.  All right.  Another clip from the first time we did the 55-gallon drum challenge.  All right.  We're going to start the pouring festivities.  Okay.  We're going to start, I guess, like you can start any party, with a couple of beers.  Okay.  All right.  Some Budweiser? 
[01:13:30]  That's a waste of a mighty fine beer, Anthony.  I'm not talking about pouring it.  Oh.  I'm drinking it.  Okay.  All right.  Are you willing, if you really have to go to the bathroom, to just go in there?  I don't think so.  No?  No.  I'm fine, so I'm all right.  Are you okay?  I'm all right, yeah.  Yeah?  I've got a lot of...  What'd she say?  I just poured the beer on her head while she was talking. 
[01:14:00]  Notice I started with Wendy.  How you doing, Wendy?  Well, it's good for the hair.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, let's start dumping stuff in there.  Okay.  Let's go.  All right.  Hey, Christy.  How you doing?  Everything in the carriage?  Woo-hoo!  Here, mic the girls as they're getting stuff dumped in.  It's good.  Wow!  All right.  There you go.  A little bit of a...  All right.  The festival is that have begun.  Hey, Kate.  How you doing?  Be kind.  Be kind?  How's that? 
[01:14:30]  Goddamn, this is fun.  They're trying to avoid the stuff, Anthony, as you're pouring in there.  I'm mixing today. 
[01:15:00]  I said that to make Jim Norton go.  Yeah, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774. Wow. 
[01:15:30]  Rock.  I love when we get the new Tom clips in. Yes.  We did one broadcast, we have hundreds of Tom clips.  Jesus Christ, we're in New Orleans, man. 
[01:16:00]  Wrong.  Do the Rick's wife one again.  My wife and Rick's wife are hitting it off pretty good. Look at them on the couch.  My wife and Rick's wife. I'll say, I'll say, let me say, boy.  I'm about as sharp as a sack of wet mice down here.  What we have here is failure to communicate.  I'll say, I'll say, Rick, get your wife in the hot tub, hot tub, that is. 
[01:16:30]  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mice.  You're too slow. The quick ones are going right by you, boy.  You look like two miles of bad road.  I made a funny, son, and you're not laughing.  That was him, man. I made a funny.  I made a funny.  You're too short. They're going right over your head, boy. 
[01:17:00]  I'll say, pay attention.  I forgot we had these.  Arr, har, hearty, har, har.  Smart him.  Close enough.  Yeah.  That's his tongue.  Well, smarty pants, what you gonna do now?  I'll say, I'll say, the station's off there.  Off there, that is.  It is.  How obnoxious is that? 
[01:17:30]  Must be that dog.  We rule, man.  We rule.  I'll say, rule.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  Who says, my bad, still?  That's the wrong guy.  My bad.  My bad.  How you guys doing?  Of course, the famous.  That's already famous, right?  Yeah.  How do you know who your daddy is? 
[01:18:00]  Because your mama told you.  Hey, boy.  That's an attention getter.  Hey, Rick.  We're gonna go back to our house.  We got a hot tub, baby.  Hot tub, baby.  Hot tub, that is.  Hot tub, baby.  Claire Bertrand.  Hot tub, baby.  Hot tub, baby.  Junkmail Jerry from the city writes, that Screaming Tom sound effect sounds remarkably like the 
[01:18:30]  sound Rock Hole made once you guys arrived back in Boston.  Hey.  Ah.  No.  Claire Bertrand.  Claire Bertrand.  No, Dave.  What do I do?  Well, Rock Hole, let's do everything they're doing on your show.  We'll try it.  They have an F.U. line.  You come up with an F.U. line of your own.  But we'll call it something different.  Hey, you have sex for Sam. 
[01:19:00]  We'll have a sex around New England.  It's the same thing.  They have Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Why don't you have Ash Whipping Wednesday?  All right.  Well, maybe that worked, Gabe.  I took your advice.  Let me check the ratings.  Sorry, my timing's off today.  Well, he needed time to look at the ratings.  And I needed time to find the goddamn clip.  Kim from Jersey checking in.  What's up, Kim?  Hey.  Hi, I'm sorry.  You caught me right in the middle of a big swallow. 
[01:19:30]  A big swallow.  Yes.  I want to be a contestant on your 55-hour day.  Yeah?  Oh, you do, do you?  Yeah.  I don't think we're just letting any old brought in this contest here.  Why not?  What is the criteria, Opie?  I don't know.  I think you've got to prove yourself.  This is one of our special benchmarks.  They call it a benchmark in the biz.  A benchmark.  This is one of the Opie and Anthony benchmarks.  All right.  What do I got to do?  Some other shows have 5 o'clock funnies as their benchmark. 
[01:20:00]  We have the 55-gallon drum challenge benchmark.  So what is it?  I don't think we had it.  No, looking at some of the contestants, we had no criteria last time.  No, we were pretty much the first five girls that called it.  That's it.  But now we're in other cities.  We want to get the other cities involved.  We want to get some special girls.  All right.  So what do I got to do?  You tell us, Kim.  Maybe you could come in and prove your worthiness somehow.  All right.  Maybe we could have a little 55-gallon drum tryout type of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have to see how you handle it. 
[01:20:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I can handle it.  The claustrophobia.  I can handle anything.  Yeah, you can handle gross stuff being unloaded on you.  Yes, I can.  Maybe we should, you know, because everyone knows we don't like doing much work.  We like leaving everything to the listeners.  Yeah.  And then we sit back and take all the credit.  Uh-huh.  Reap the profits.  Reap the profits.  They come up with all the killer lines, but everyone thinks it's us.  You know, that type of thing.  Right.  Um, maybe we should just leave it up to the ladies.  How are they going to impress us to get into the 55-gallon drum challenge? 
[01:21:00]  Hmm.  And then, like, Kim, if Kim has an idea, she comes down here and shows us.  All right.  Like a little talent portion of the competition.  That kind of relates to something, uh...  Sexual and dirty.  Not necessarily.  Yeah.  No.  Well, that certainly would help.  Sure.  Sure.  Like, if you could, um...  I think what we're looking for, if I can say maybe, um, let's just say,  you were to come up here and do a headstand and then do, like, uh, yellow discipline all 
[01:21:30]  over yourself, that would be something that would be like, all right, she could take a  little liquid on her and...  Yeah.  And you'd win a wedding ring from me.  From Lorton?  Maybe.  This is what we're going to call the short program.  The short program?  It's the short program, and then the 55-gallon drum will be the long program.  Yeah.  So, you know what?  Uh, qualifying is on.  Ladies, what would you do?  I would do what you just said.  But then again...  You will come in, do a headstand.  And yellow discipline yourself?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  She wins.  I hit...  She's in.  All right.  I have a slight problem, though.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  Well, if we want to get the other cities involved...  Well, I guess they've got to be so motivated to come down to New York to show us what they've  got.  They'd have to come here for the drum challenge anyway, so...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Or maybe people that live in other cities just happen to be in New York, and they can represent  that way.  You know?  Hey...  Yeah, because we need these girls to kind of qualify.  Not only that, we've got to look, uh, we've got to take care of New York,  too.  Yeah.  I'm going to say it right now.  You know, New York, I understand they're feeling a little jilted. 
[01:22:30]  We've spent a lot of time on, uh, listeners from other cities around the country.  Yes, we are, Ovi.  I know.  And, uh, no, this one, I think, if you're in New York, if you're on vacation in New York,  that's fine.  You know what?  Uncle John makes a great point.  God damn.  Uh, Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, we already know Kim Swallows.  What other criteria is there?  Yeah, that's true.  She did say she was in the middle of a big swallow.  Yeah, that should have put her over the top right there.  Very good.  All right, so, Kim, you would come down and do what, uh, Ann suggested. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  If that's what Norton loves, right?  He loves to yell discipline, I'll do it.  Yeah.  You bet I do.  You think you'd be able to do a headstand and do it?  Sure.  Like Norton will hold your feet?  All right.  Can you be here by 515?  I saw him in Philly.  Yeah, I'll do it.  All right.  How far are you from, uh, the station right now?  Um, oh, God.  I don't even know where yous are.  All right.  Well, you...  Midtown Manhattan.  We could book you for tomorrow.  All right.  I'll tell you right now.  If you could, uh, accomplish that feat, we, uh, we will... 
[01:23:30]  You will be the first...  You're in.  In the 55...  You're in, if I may say.  Okay.  You are in.  All right.  So, what...  We'll book me for tomorrow, then.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  Because fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth, and the truth's on your side, Bubba.  People are loving the references.  Although, people in Ronkonkrum are still mad at you from your comment the other day.  We'll let them move the mullet out of their eyes and come down and do something about it. 
[01:24:00]  But a mullet doesn't get in your eyes.  No, I know that, but...  Well, if it turns your head fast enough, it does.  And if it's a bad mullet, maybe it's long on the front and short on the sides.  I gotta get...  I gotta...  I gotta put the bat signal out.  We need Al, the drum guy, to call Rick.  What?  I think he supplied the drums last year.  Those drums were awesome.  Oh, they were good, because they were the plastic ones.  You know what, though?  Someone suggested on email...  Yeah.  ...that we have see-through drums this year.  I don't know if they make those, do they?  No, and it takes the fear out of it. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, because then it's not...  Then they could see a little more.  I like the claustrophobia that they...  Yeah, that's true.  ...that they get.  It's embarrassing if they look out and they see a bunch of guys whacking their bags,  listening to their screen.  All right.  Aiming for one of the holes in the barrel.  Get a good one.  Uh, Joanne.  Yes?  Hi, Joanne.  What's up?  Hello, guys.  Yeah.  I have a suggestion of things, what to pour over them.  Uh-huh.  If you take isomil, which is a baby formula, with iron... 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  ...and you leave it in the heat for five days, it chunks up and it stinks like hell.  Oh, God.  Well, I mean, I cleaned my baby's bottle after leaving it out for six hours and I'm ready to puke.  Hey, you know, I should tell everyone, too, two guys in this studio puked last year because  the smell was so bad in the studio.  You know what?  What?  I think Rick puked?  I know.  Or dry heaved?  I dry heaved like four times.  Yeah.  It was real close.  I puked cleaning my baby's bottle when it was left out for six hours.  The stench in this studio when we did it the first time around was unbearable. 
[01:25:30]  It'll be great.  Yeah.  We had some of New York's finest show up with that stuff they throw down.  Oh, that's right.  We had the...  Yeah, we did have the NYPD come by after the 55-gallon drum challenge with stuff they throw  down when they find rotting bodies in apartments.  Yeah, they throw it down and it's absorbed the smell.  Well, we've all read those stories where the body was dead for a week or two and they  floated, leaking fluids.  And the only way to get rid of the stench and make it bearable is this stuff that they 
[01:26:00]  throw down.  Yeah.  Works pretty good.  It's like kitty litter or wet, dry stuff.  Oh, get the stuff that the janitor used to throw over puke.  Yeah.  Zing something, right?  What?  In the cafeteria at school or something.  When someone puked in the hall and they put that stuff in the hall.  Yeah.  I think that was just old-fashioned sawdust.  Yeah.  Oh, look, we got another contender, possibly.  All right, Joanne, thank you.  You're welcome.  Hey, someone's got to keep track of all the suggestions of things that were important to  the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Email it to us or whatever so we can really make sure we go over the top, right? 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  All right, let's go to Shannon, who wants in.  Shannon.  Hi.  She's in D.C.  What's up, Shannon?  What's up?  I want to be in the drum.  All right, well...  You do.  Tell us a little something about you.  Yeah.  I can put both ankles behind my head at the same time.  All right, you're in.  That's pretty good, but...  Well, we're looking for something you could do to kind of...  Can you reach with your head?  Because that would really be fun to watch. 
[01:27:00]  No, I think I'd do surgery for that.  Yeah.  We're looking for girls to come down and kind of qualify and show us what they're all about.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I'm in D.C., dude.  I know.  That's kind of a problem.  Well, yeah, I think it ought to stay personal, though.  I mean, if she can put her legs behind her head, I mean, you know, theoretically, an  elephant can hang from a cliff with his tail tied to a daisy.  I mean, I think that you should just come in.  You know, we're going to regret not taking her as a contestant.  Why?  Well, because we'll probably end up with just one contestant.  Well, I think the local girls have an advantage. 
[01:27:30]  That's true.  Because they could come down here and prove what they got.  You know what, Shannon?  But I think in the end, we'll pick a few girls from other cities, definitely.  We should take her info down.  Yeah, Shannon, we'll take your info.  Hey, hold on.  Can you scream real good?  I can scream great, but I don't think I will.  You don't want to scream right now?  Oh, no, I can.  I just don't think I will when you got me in the drum.  I used to work in a bait shop, man.  Yeah.  Uh-oh. 
[01:28:00]  A bait shop, huh?  Hey, Jason from WJFK is writing on Instant Feedback.  We can Amtrak any contestants from D.C. to New York for the 55-gallon drum contest.  Ah.  Shannon, would you be willing to come up here on Amtrak to show us what you got?  Oh, yeah.  You know, it'll be a fun day trip to New York.  I don't know.  We'll get some gift certificates or something to make it worth your while.  But now, if you're coming up to New York to see us, you've got to do something.  Like, the first girl, she's going to do a headstand and do yellow discipline on herself. 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  It's going to be fun to watch, isn't it, Norton?  More than you can imagine.  So, you want to think about it in calls back?  Well, see, I don't know if I can do a headstand.  No, you don't have to.  Anything.  Anything else.  You know, maybe have guys puke on you.  I'm just, you know, I'm just grabbing stuff out of thin air here.  I don't know.  Yeah, that's not any high school rage coming out on your part.  That was just a little thing you pulled out of thin air. 
[01:29:00]  It's got to be something a little bit on the lines of the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Like, maybe something disgusting on you.  Right.  How about a nasty three-day-old chum?  Three-day-old chum, and what would you do with it?  Pour it all over myself.  Would you dump it on your nude body?  Sure.  Well, I already know by how you said sure that you don't want to be nude, which is fine.  How about like a broad...  Well, maybe... 
[01:29:30]  Aunt and I are experienced at this.  Trust me, you have no desire to get nude for us.  Right.  But how about like a bra and panties or something like that?  Yeah, that'll work.  Because see, the girls that want to get nude for us, we ask that question.  It's like, yeah!  You know.  Yeah.  There was a hesitation.  You know, it was obvious.  All right.  How about this?  You come up to New York with the three-day-old chum.  How about we get a big...  What size...  What's your breast size?  And I actually have a reason for asking this.  I wear a 36DD. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, so she's got huge cans.  So we fill up her bra cups as she's wearing it with chum and her panties.  You want to fill up your panties and bra with chum?  I'll do the bra, but I think the panties might cause some kind of nasty infection, dude.  Dare to dream.  Yeah.  What if you don't want that smell to get all over the chum?  You might as well go home.  It's not getting any better than that today, my friend.  Beautiful.com for Jim Norton's tour dates.  Oh, my God.  They're going up today, actually. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  We'll fill your bra cups up with chum.  How about we duct tape things so there's no chance of that happening?  Duct tape things?  Duct tape?  No, I'm just kidding.  So, you know, filling up the bra...  We'll fill up our bra cups.  Yeah, all right.  That's pretty good.  And if you could do that, I think you'll impress us and we could save you a space in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on the line, Shannon.  They put frogs in your bra.  Can you come up tomorrow or Friday? 
[01:31:00]  I don't know.  I got to work.  All right.  Hold on the line and Rick will try to figure it out with you, okay?  Okay.  Figure out the scheduling.  Have her take a batch.  Everyone thinking about the batch.  Yeah.  Life's about more than a batch.  Enough with the batch.  Batches are fun once in a while, but what about personality and intelligence?  Uh-oh.  I like the idea that this is a two-tiered thing now, where we're going to see a little action  beforehand and then really get the torture.  We'll kind of know what skeeves out the girls a little bit and what doesn't. 
[01:31:30]  I think we have to ask them for a scream, too.  Yeah.  We want some good screams.  Oh, yeah, we do.  When it gets scary.  Oh, yeah.  Because you guys are now in so many cities, you can be a little picky.  You don't need to be on the phone desperate for the first gal that calls.  You're going to have a lot of people wanting to do this.  I think I might have hung up on Shannon, so if she's listening, call back.  A lot of people from New York, though, I think we want because it's easier that way.  They could just come in, demonstrate their talent, and then come back for the 55-gallon drum  without a problem.  But the good thing is, though, if they're from out of town, may not have money for a 
[01:32:00]  hotel, may not want to sleep in the cold.  And can stay with you.  Well, I'm not saying with me.  I'm just saying that there may be a person in New York who may be willing to fill their  throats with...  Oh, my God.  Look at some of this stuff.  Damien from Philly, 55-gallon drum challenge, pour in deer musk.  Oh, yeah, that's what they used to hunt with.  Jim, how about old tobacco chew spit?  You guys, start saving up your chew spit.  Save it up. 
[01:32:30]  That is rank, man.  Save up...  Someone out there, save up your chew spit.  The guy that saves up the most chew spit will be invited down to the contest to personally  pour it into the drums.  I'll spit it in this bottle, and I'll save it.  Bong water.  Bong water?  That's pretty good.  That's nasty.  You need bong water.  Start saving the bong water.  I would say the two minutes too small are the gum that you see in urinals. 
[01:33:00]  Who's going to pick that out?  Well, you get...  Yeah, that's a good point.  And then it gets in their hair.  I guess we can't do that.  You did say gum, didn't you, with a G?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, gum.  Bubble gum.  Bubble gum.  How about the urinal mint?  Ah.  Used urinal cake.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  I'm going to bring in a whole bucket of live fiddler crabs.  Now, do the fiddler crabs bite?  Sure they do.  Why not add a little torture to the lid?  Yeah, they nip a little bit.  Yeah, but they're for fun biting. 
[01:33:30]  Nipping is okay.  Biting is bad.  The little ones.  The ones you see scrumming around on the marsh, use them for blackfish.  Yeah, a little nip.  All right, we'll use a little nippage.  What do you say?  All right, hold on a line.  We'll get your info.  All the statists that are going to be calling in now, I've got a beehive in the back I can  bring in.  The beauty of this challenge, you really don't know what's going to end up in the barrel.  These are a lot of suggestions, but we'll surprise you the day of the challenge.  Eddie, what's up?  What's up? 
[01:34:00]  My cousin owns a bait store.  I could get live eels, live killies, live morse bunker, and I could get you some of those  crabs that guy was talking about.  And glasses.  So I have them.  Well, my head was bashed apart.  But the only problem is, I only could keep them alive a certain amount of hours, so you  have to use them early.  You know what I'm talking about?  What is morse, sir?  Morse bunker.  They use that for...  Morse bunker there.  Yeah.  What's morse bunker?  That's what they use for bluefish.  Oh, the bunker. 
[01:34:30]  Their bunker, right.  It's very nasty.  Side card.  Solve.  Remember the last time we did it?  The Popeye surprise?  Ah, the Popeye surprise.  Which was worse than chum.  Yeah, this stuff was...  Just a mixture of everything.  Fish guts and all sorts of crabs.  The guy used it to chum with, but it was so disgusting.  We called it the Popeye surprise.  Thank you, Eddie.  All right, Eddie.  Hold on, all right?  Okay.  Cool.  Thank you.  Hey, this guy is already saving his spit.  Good.  Scott from Connecticut. 
[01:35:00]  Already saving his dip spit.  Good.  Oh, my God.  Well, we're going to put it over the top this time around, I'm telling you.  Last time it was a goof, and we just kind of threw it together, and people came down.  And it was pretty good, but we're going to plan for this one.  It's disgusting.  Frenchie wants in.  Ah, Frenchie.  Hey, great...  How you been doing?  Hey, Frenchie, great job on the Olympic judging with your French...  Yeah, destroy them, shoot them, kill them, those bastards. 
[01:35:30]  But they're French.  Yeah, but kill F them, God damn it.  They suck ass.  Well, listen, I have something for the barrel.  Oh, you do?  What do you have?  Yes, I have those lamb brains that's sitting down in the water for about five or six days,  and it smells wonderful.  Lamb brains.  Yeah, not the brain, but the water that's sitting in the water.  Lamb brain water.  Oh, bloody and stuff.  All right, save it for us, Frenchie.  I will.  I'll save a whole gallon of it.  How about that? 
[01:36:00]  All right, very good.  All right, take it easy, guys.  And the French suck.  They're listening.  They can go after them, those bastards.  All right, Frenchie.  All right, they're Frenchies.  Don't burn yourself out.  Yeah, let's...  All right, bye.  Let's keep it to a minimum.  Can't burn them out.  Well, I was going to play the Frenchie, Graham.  Oh, really?  You got that, uh...  A little something for Valentine's Day.  Sure.  It's not a real commercial, so we're, you know, don't break for commercials.  Right.  In the other cities.  Here we go.  Are you worried about saying the right thing on Valentine's Day?  Why not let someone else express how you really feel by sending a Frenchie, Graham? 
[01:36:30]  You jackass.  Why not let a drunk, obnoxious frog tell that special someone what's in your heart?  Go F yourself.  Frenchie will call your loved one at 3 a.m. sharp to deliver the news.  Often in a drunken rage.  Going out like eight by a twat.  For a little extra, Frenchie can deliver the news personally.  Twat.  Don't kill yourself.  And it's not just for guys. 
[01:37:00]  Ladies, Frenchie can be equally sensitive to your Prince Charming.  Come on in.  Look at, man.  Call now.  1-800-WE-SURRENDER.  That's 1-800-WE-SURRENDER.  You're too dying.  It's fat, so...  So make it the best Valentine's Day ever.  Send a Frenchie, Graham.  Get lost, you bitch.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:30]  It's a squid.  It's a big squid.  It's a big squid.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Old Dirty standing by.  I think he wants to talk about the Winter Olympics.  Old Dirty.  Naughty Naughty Contest.  The voting continues.  Yeah.  Go to opiananthony.com.  You can vote every day. 
[01:38:00]  We need to narrow the 98 contestants down to 20.  And then the voting will get interesting.  Oh, yeah.  On Monday.  We're really fast, Chris.  As we talk about the 55-gallon drum challenge, which is coming soon for the O and A Show.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Chris.  What's up?  How you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, my family has a slaughterhouse, and we slaughter pigs.  I can offer you.  We clean them out entirely.  Intestines, livers, blood.  You name it, we got it. 
[01:38:30]  This contest already sounds better.  The stomach lining, too?  You got to watch it.  That's the first time we did it.  Why?  If you break the stomach lining, it still has all the S in it.  So it's just, oh, it's horrible.  So you can bring us some pig stomachs?  Oh, stomachs, livers, kidneys, bucket of blood.  But we got to heat it up because it collagulates.  Oh, my God.  I hope these girls know what they're getting into, man.  That's why we needed to get the special girls.  This is good stuff, boys.  The qualifying has begun for this little contest, little challenge. 
[01:39:00]  We're looking for the ladies to call us and tell us what they would do to get into the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Something sick and demented.  Hey, dude.  Yeah.  How long have your family been in this business?  Oh, 1905.  My grandfather's father started it.  And when you were a kid, did they bring in and show you the little piggies?  Yeah, I've been around it for years and used to the smell.  I could bring you guys in a tape of the whole operation of how we kill them.  Yeah, but were you horrified at first as a little kid? 
[01:39:30]  No, you know, as a little kid, I grew up so young and used to it that it never bothered me.  I bring friends over there, and they're grossed out by it.  There's blood everywhere.  There's pigs squealing.  You watch them just like, how do they off the pig?  It's a big stick, well, not a stick, but it's got two prongs at the end, and you give them electrical shock right behind the ears.  That pretty much puts them down on the ground.  They're pretty much dead at that point.  You electrocute them with a prod right behind the ear?  Yeah.  And then what?  That's a sick job. 
[01:40:00]  That's one job I can never do.  All the years I've been there, that's one thing I can't do.  Actually killing them.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  And then they get hung by one foot upside down.  One foot upside down.  Slits the throat.  Who slits the throat?  We got some hectares for that.  Some hectares, you call them?  Now, what does he just go by with a knife?  Yeah, a knife.  There's a certain spot you have to get in the esophagus where the two aortas meet, and you get the right blood.  Holy Jesus. 
[01:40:30]  And the Chinese cook with the blood.  We sell a lot of the blood for resale.  So how many are hanging by that one foot at one time when the hectares come by and just slip the throat?  About 15 at a time.  So 15 at a clip, and are they twitching or anything at this point?  Yeah, a little twitch, but once they're upside down, they twitch it.  You might get a little kick or a little jerk, but that's about it.  Holy Jesus, man.  See, how come they don't just kill them with the electricity?  I mean, if you're going to kill them, just do it real quick and painless.  I think that's what they...  It's pretty much, it does kill them that way. 
[01:41:00]  Like they're going to twitch.  It's probably fast, like after they zap them, it's like they hang them right up, right?  Yeah, yep.  So it's like, bam.  So they're still just twitching from being a living animal twitching.  I've seen footage of the lambs, and they hang them upside down.  They're like, meh, and they just cut their throats.  And the same thing, we do lambs and goats.  Oh, do you electrocute them?  Yep, same way.  Same way.  And little baby lambs, and they're hanging there, and you watch them get killed.  How do they do cows?  Cows are bigger.  That requires a shot to the brain with a... 
[01:41:30]  It's not quite a shotgun.  It's a little bit smaller than a shotgun, and that's pretty much awesome like that.  How does that work?  How does that work?  Yeah, what is it?  Like the cows are let in, and then...  They're in a little holding area where they can't move or anything.  There's one at a time because they're so big.  Cows are, you know, a couple hundred, five hundred pounds.  Right.  Hey, I've got to ask Chris, are you immune to this at this point?  Yeah, at this point it...  It doesn't bother you at all?  No, not at all.  Because when I see some of that footage on TV, I'm deeply disturbed.  Oh, they just go...  And it takes a lot to really get that type of reaction out of me, but it's really sad. 
[01:42:00]  It gets me going.  But to you, it's what?  Just another day at the office?  Just another day at work.  Wow.  Hey, Chris.  Yes.  So they take that big thing?  What is it?  Like a...  What does it shoot?  It shoots a bullet.  It shoots a bullet.  It actually shoots a bullet.  Yeah.  Is it gunpowder?  Yep.  So they take this thing, put it against the head.  What, does the heck to do that?  No, no.  One of the other guys do that.  That's a little bit...  You have to be a little bit better with the shot with that.  And where do they put it?  Right there, the head. 
[01:42:30]  Wow.  This is reminding me of an old bit, Anthony, from the ONA Archives.  I remember that one.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, Chris.  Hold on a line, all right?  We're going to use you for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Good deal, boy.  Thanks.  You know something?  I...  Get Chris's info on line three.  Hey, I like hearing about stuff like that because I just think it's so, like, macabre.  It's really...  I just said macabre.  And...  But I'll tell you one thing.  I love steak.  You know?  I'm not going to be the guy that goes, oh, that's awful that those animals have to go 
[01:43:00]  through...  You know something?  Slice me off a nice, thick chunk.  Cook it up medium rare.  I love it.  Well, Anthony, evil Barney, um...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Took the kids to the slaughterhouse.  Remember Barney?  We all remember Barney.  The purple dinosaur?  Uh, it seems there's an evil incarnation of Barney.  And, uh...  But he taught kids, too.  Yeah.  So he brought a bunch of kids to a slaughterhouse to show them how, uh...  Yeah.  How that worked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, kids. 
[01:43:30]  Don't listen to those animal rights vegetarian wussies.  No, no.  Carrots and cucumbers are good for one thing and one thing only.  And that's kinky sex with cheap hookers.  Oh, boy.  Boys and girls need lots of bloody red meat.  So let's magically go to the slaughterhouse and see where hamburgers come from.  After the big, dumb animals are fattened up, they're led into the killing bands. 
[01:44:00]  Where, kicking and screaming, a big bolt is shot through their skulls.  Oh, boy.  Yowch.  Then their throats are slipped wide open so the blood can pour out of their bodies.  Oh, boy.  Flip this switch to me and watch Bessie do the convulsing cow death dance.  Look at him croak.  Oh, boy.  Don't get any on you, Susie.  I love meat, red and raw.  Open up that cow with a great egg saw. 
[01:44:30]  With a smashed in skull and a throat slashed ear to ear.  I'm gonna get a burger and a nice cold beer.  Oh, boy.  Bye.  Bye, boys and girls.  Jesus Christ.  I heard that.  Well, we were a little angry back then.  I hadn't heard that in a while.  We were a little angry.  Oh, boy.  It's like you don't want to know how they do it to get your food.  Right.  But, you know, the reality is there.  He just told us.  You know, especially Chicago, where the slaughterhouse is there. 
[01:45:00]  I mean, that's a...  You drive past a whole area of a city and you'll smell that dying animal.  The smell of death in the air.  Well, you can't enjoy a steak and then criticize the manner in which they provide it.  Exactly.  Dan, what's going on?  I don't mind.  Dan has something for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Dan?  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I went to college down in North Carolina and started a bad habit of chewing tobacco. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  And kids at school, you know, they'd come over and drink all my soda and everything I had in the fridge.  So I started replacing it with chewing tobacco in the soda.  Oh, God.  And one night, I was having a party and put that in the fridge.  Nobody drank it the whole night.  Everybody leaves.  I was all pissed off.  My girlfriend goes downstairs to get a drink.  All of a sudden, I hear screaming.  She had drank the chewing tobacco.  Your girlfriend did.  But anyway, I have a five-gallon water bottle here filled with it right now. 
[01:46:00]  A five-gallon jug of your tobacco spit.  And I could probably double that by the time the contest comes.  Awful, man.  Wow.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We're going to need you.  Okay.  There goes Dan.  Yeah.  Looking for the ladies.  We have one coming in tomorrow to try to qualify.  Look at Coney from New Hampshire saying the guy should bring the electric pig killer to quickly poke into the barrel. 
[01:46:30]  Poke the little gals.  Dang.  What a taser.  It's a taser.  Yeah, you guys finished with this?  Oh, my God, dude.  What's the matter, O'Day?  Killing these poor pigs.  I like my pork chops and my steak, man.  But just like I said, I don't really want to know how they kill them, you know?  No, huh?  Sounds horrendous.  What's the deal, Noreen?  How you doing?  What's the deal, baby?  So, what do you got today, O'Day?  Damn freaking Olympics suck, yo.  Why?  The biggest scandal was what? 
[01:47:00]  The skating thing?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  But, yo, look at the sport, yo.  The bitches try to take each other out by smacking the other one over across the ankle with a pipe in, you know what I mean?  Yeah, I remember that.  That was about two Olympics ago.  Sure.  But he's, you know, I think he's bringing up a good point.  It hasn't always been this nice...  There's always a scandal, yo.  There's always some kind of a scandal going on with the judges or even the...  Yeah.  Homegirl try to take the other homegirl out with a pipe to the ankles. 
[01:47:30]  Wasn't there a sex and alcohol thing, too?  There was all sorts of things going on.  Yeah, baby.  Come on, man.  That whole skating, you know, it's horrendous, yo.  That should be an Olympic sport, yo.  Killing the pig in the fastest time.  So, you've been checking out the Olympics?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not trying to diss nobody, man.  But what is curling, dude?  We were watching that yesterday at Bar 9.  Yeah, the curling Canadian sport.  It's pretty bad, huh?  Yo, what do they do that classifies as an athletic sport, man? 
[01:48:00]  I mean, the store weighs 40 pounds.  Yeah.  So, I guess you've got to carry it to the ice and everything.  You know what I mean?  Then you've got to get your squeegee, man.  Well, it's shuffleboard for ice.  Shuffle.  Oh, dirty.  It's shuffleboarding.  You know what I'm thinking?  They should pretty much call the Winter and Summer Olympics what they really are.  Well, what is it?  The black and the white Olympics.  Because we all know the Summer Olympics are for the black people.  Exactly. 
[01:48:30]  And the Winter Olympics, I mean, the black people do not even care about the Winter Olympics.  That's right.  They're not.  I don't know who the hell is representing anybody of color in the Winter Olympics.  And the Summer Olympics, you think a white guy is going to win those goddamn track events?  Or something?  No way.  The long jumps and stuff like that?  Basketball?  I mean, think about it.  Exactly.  Well, the black guys, they've got the bigger muscles, Anthony.  Well, you know, it's like Jimmy the Greek said.  Yeah, they were bred years ago with the, you know, it was like the slave owner would take 
[01:49:00]  the big black buck and breed him with the biggest black female that they found.  And what you'd get is a strong athlete with a bigger and higher thigh muscle.  You'll do.  So they can jump higher.  The better athlete.  And, you know, I just wish they'd leave coaching of the white people.  You know, yo, my man.  Is this on?  I love that.  Yo, let me tell you something.  PBS always had a commentator that put their foot in their mouth, man. 
[01:49:30]  Jimmy the Greek did it.  And that other guy.  Howard Cosell has the most legendary.  Look at that little monkey run.  Remember that?  I can't.  He said that during Monday Night Football.  Yo, it wasn't racist, though.  He didn't mean it racist.  No, he's just saying, look at him go, a little monkey.  Yeah, that's not racist, Jim.  Of course not.  He seemed to have an expression people use it.  Right.  Yeah, of course.  But let me tell you something.  Maybe in your neighborhood when you guys were all wearing the hoods. 
[01:50:00]  Instead of the poor white kid going to track and field school, he gets to go curling.  He gets to the curling academy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the curling thing is a pretty ridiculous sport.  I don't get it.  What are you supposed to, sweep away the snow in front of the big weighted thing?  Sweep away the ice shaving.  So you're sweeping.  It's a sweeping event.  You're squeegeeing.  I could have built my whole team with the squeegee men from downtown. 
[01:50:30]  We went out to Salt Lake and went to go, kid.  Try that next time.  Hold on.  Angry Angel is very pissed.  Why is he pissed?  He's on with you, old dirty.  Angry Angel.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, man?  It's freezing over here, man.  Where you at?  I just came back from Puerto Rico, you know.  Viva Vecca.  You're on vacation, my brother.  What are you doing with yourself, man?  Vacation?  Yeah, it's called prison.  Why didn't you stay?  Hey, hey, hey.  No, no, listen. 
[01:51:00]  I just called because they're on a very, very interesting topic.  Why isn't there Hispanics in the Olympics?  What, Hispanics?  There's no Spanish people in the Olympics.  Not in the Winter Olympics.  Huh?  Not in the Winter Olympics.  Yeah, you guys are too busy selling the snow.  Y'all help me, man.  Y'all help me, man.  Don't even go there, man.  Don't even go there.  Try to eat the things here, my brother.  Hey, yo, you're putting the squeegee teeth together.  I can get a bunch of people to rip cars. 
[01:51:30]  Angel, where'd you get that phone?  Yeah, Angry Angel calls back when you got a landliner.  Your phone blows.  Hey, Angry Angel, steal a better phone.  And maybe this summer they could do subway car riding on the roof.  That could be an Olympic event.  Y'all will be.  Yeah.  Again in Brazil.  We're trying to bring our coaches together.  You know what I'm saying?  When you say these things, it's damaging to what we're trying to do here.  We're trying to bridge over these stereotypes, okay? 
[01:52:00]  Well, we're talking about stereotypes a little bit today, Old Dirty, and I've got to bring  up a couple of things that were in the paper today, Ophie.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, wait, wait, what?  But, um...  Hold on.  Hold on, O.D.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  O.D., maybe you could have a comment on this being of...  You're talking of...  All right, go ahead, man.  ...Hispanic descent.  Where are you from?  Oh, me?  Yeah.  I'm Hispanic American.  But you're from what?  What are your family?  Dominican?  Yeah.  Okay.  And you're American, you ass.  Yeah, I'm American, yeah.  We discuss that on the show all the time. 
[01:52:30]  You're an American.  All right, all right, all right.  We've been through that.  Come on, what's the deal?  What do you think the top three leading causes of death for these various race groups...  Go ahead.  ...from the age of one...  ...the age of one years old...  Okay.  ...to 44 years old?  That's not a long lifespan, kid.  Well, this is the group we're concentrating on.  One to 44...  One to 44?  ...in these groups.  Okay.  ...in white, in white, non-Hispanic...  Okay. 
[01:53:00]  ...the number one cause of death.  ...is honestly working to death.  ...is working to support the freeloaders.  Shut up.  ...honestly working to death.  All right, all right.  The number one cause of death in a non-white...  ...in a non-Hispanic white male?  What?  All right.  The number of people, Hispanic, that understand the question.  Yeah, we beat it because no one interrupted.  Simple as this.  How does...  Top three ways whitey dies. 
[01:53:30]  Whitey dies.  Top three ways.  All right.  Between one and 44 years old.  A heart attack?  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Well, not gunshots.  Damn, dude.  Like having an accident?  And I don't even got a...  Or maybe a serious illness.  Because you white people always getting cancer and some...  and all these outrageous diseases, man.  Yeah, go figure.  It happens when you live over 35.  Well, Whitey, number one, yes. 
[01:54:00]  At least we don't get the sickle cell.  Joe, don't be, man.  I don't see sickle cell on the list.  Number one, white, non-Hispanic, number one, motor vehicle accidents.  Kill more people between 1 and 44.  Although, I don't know, one-year-olds are driving a car.  It must be the passengers.  Whitey.  Whitey.  Whitey, traffic accidents kill more people between 1 and 44 than anything else.  We do like this.  Mr. Norton.  We do like to drink and drive, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  Whitey likes to drink and drive.  That kills more people. 
[01:54:30]  It's always Whitey that plows through the wedding procession on some highway in Long Island, you know?  Yes, it is, Norton.  All right, let's move on, Ant.  Number two for Whitey.  Number two, the big casino, Tony.  I told you.  I got the big casino.  You know, I got the ass cancer, Tony, but I'm going to Dr. Kennedy.  Oh, Dr. Kennedy.  He's going to fix me up, Tony.  The big C.  And number three, having to deal with the Hispanics and the blacks. 
[01:55:00]  Number three for White's suicide.  And you notice, as more moving to the neighborhood, the more self-inflicted gunshot wounds we suffer from.  So, Whitey, the top three, motor vehicle accidents, cancer, and suicide.  Yeah, you know, you people are a little twisted.  You guys drive horrendously.  When you order meat, you go out, you go out medium rare.  You just, you sing to the top of the meat and it's never cooked.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Calm down, because here's the... 
[01:55:30]  And then boom, suicides.  You guys did discover grunge rock, you know?  Here's the blacks now.  Yeah, man.  And none of the top three is the same.  Oh, no.  Not one is the same for black and white.  There's a difference here in cultures, people.  That's right.  We're all the same except for the color of our skin.  No, we're not.  We're really not.  And this just, there's something to this.  Between one and 44, blacks.  Number one.  What do you think number one is? 
[01:56:00]  Gunshots.  Homicide.  There you go.  You're putting a rock right behind this?  Right.  Number one cause of death for blacks between one and 44 is murder.  That's right.  Is another person killing that person.  Mm-hmm.  That is insane.  But, dude, sometimes there's a reason for these things, dude.  Somebody's just not going to kill...  You know, some...  Well, there are times the person might die during a robbery, 
[01:56:30]  during the committing of a violent felony.  You know what I'm saying?  But sometimes, yo, cats, cats got to get smoked for snitching.  You know what I mean?  All right.  There's a lot of different reasons.  Well, let's hear number two.  Number two.  Okay.  Boy, that stereotype food.  Eh?  You know, that food that is only a stereotype.  Okay.  Heart disease.  Heart, well...  Heart disease.  The goddamn fried foods with the high blood pressure.  I think that's for everybody, too.  You know what I mean?  Well, no. 
[01:57:00]  It's cancer and suicide for Whitey.  Yeah, boy.  Oh, man.  You guys are having more heart attacks.  Not you.  The black guys.  The black men and women, as a matter of fact.  And number three?  Yeah.  Number three.  The third cause of death for blacks between 1 and 44.  Oh, God.  The ninja.  The big high five.  The bug.  We're talking the hiv.  AIDS.  Mm-hmm.  AIDS.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of unprotected sex, man.  What are your peeps? 
[01:57:30]  Earl, get on that goddamn mic.  Yeah, Earl.  What are your peeps up to?  Murder, heart disease, and the hiv.  Top three causes of death.  Yo, I like to shoot guns, eat fried chicken, and have unprotected sex.  Thank you.  There you go.  Yeah, that's right.  My man, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  You know what, they may die young, but when you look at it like Old Dirty just said, they  live really interesting lives.  There you go.  It's a lot better than cancer, driving fast, than putting a bullet in your own head.  I know.  People suck.  Live fast, die young. 
[01:58:00]  Yo, you don't got a list for Latinos?  Here we go.  I got the Latino list.  Yeah, here we go.  Uh-oh.  Latino is a mixture of the two.  I'll tell you the truth.  Number one, motor vehicle accidents.  Mm-hmm.  Five cars, bro.  The Hispanics are crashing into the white people and killing them.  You want to know what we're doing?  What?  Insurance scams, kid.  There you go.  Number two.  Kevin.  Homicide. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, what's number two?  Murder's number two.  Yeah, well.  And number three, you Hispanics and you're cancer, the big casino.  We got the big casino, too?  Is number three, yeah.  Well, you know, we got a little European in us, you know, and still a little blue blood,  you know?  That must be it.  I guess with that princely mixture, you know what I'm saying?  He's got a little cancer that's got to come around the way, too.  Princely mixture.  Hey, guys.  They don't have this on the list, but I should say, for the age group, I've noticed just from  reading the paper, the age group of one to four, the leading cause of death in Hispanic 
[01:59:00]  families are falling out windows.  You ever notice, in this city, especially, why the hell can't Hispanic people keep their  kids in the goddamn window?  My brother, yo, come on, man.  Guys, yo, you don't put safeguards on the windows for us.  Why don't you do it yourself?  Because we don't put them on.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  We are the landlords.  Yo, dude.  Come on, man.  What's the number?  We got to pay.  Angry Angel, that's the Jews you got to yell at for that.  Yo, my man.  They own the buildings.  Yeah, that's true.  You guys own every building.  They are. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, God.  You know what it is?  I'll tell you what it is.  More stereotypes.  I'll tell you what it is, man.  The deaths between one and four are from falling out the windows.  Between five and nine, it's from unplanned pregnancy.  Nine.  God damn it, noise.  Hey, O.D., you know what's coming up, right?  What?  You know what's coming up, O.D., right?  What?  The income tax, man.  Why do you pay taxes?  All you whities, all you whities, all you whities, are you wanting to take a look at  your pay stuff? 
[02:00:00]  Think of O.D. and Angel.  That's your angel.  Don't clue me there, man.  What I can do.  Look at this guy.  Every time you get a raise, I'm getting a raise.  Angel, you punk guy.  I can't wait.  Yo, kid.  I fell on my taxes.  I'm getting back the G.  Angel's like a nickel and dime hustler.  You know what I'm saying?  So, Angel, you're digging the fact that income tax, April's coming around.  Oh, I love it, man.  I worked in the World Trade Center, and I'm getting paid. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God.  What?  By the way, O.D., they're giving out jobs like crazy.  What did he say?  They're giving out jobs over there.  Yo, don't.  Yo, you bugging, man.  Now you've crossed the line.  I don't want anybody to do that, yo.  We've been in a recession.  You guys got to get working real hard, man.  All right, Angel.  You're pissing too many people.  Yeah, man.  Yo, Angel, man.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm about to shut you down today, bro.  You out the mix, kid. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  You out the mix.  All right.  We just took Angel out of the mix.  Old Dirty, he's out the mix.  He's out the mix.  Yo.  Hey, Old Dirty, by the way, Gary on line three wants to say no Hispanics in the Olympics  because any that can run or swim are already in the United States.  Oh, God.  You know, that's cute.  That's real cute.  Well, they can't represent their country if they're already here.  Well, anyway, look, anyway, look, Latinos, we got the baseball hemmed up.  You know what I mean?  $200 million players, they're all Latinos, so there goes the athleticism for that. 
[02:01:30]  You know what I'm talking about, dog?  There you go.  Any last thoughts on the Winter Olympics as we move on?  Yeah, man, you know, we touched on a lot of things, man, but that's, you know, the Enron  executives, you know, they've put forth a new contest for the Olympics.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Who could shred the documents the quickest?  All right.  The shredder.  The Enron Olympics.  Sure.  I love it, huh?  Well, you know what, Whitey likes to shred documents.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:00]  We're real good at that.  Yeah.  It comes down to it.  You're right.  He's made 100 pounds of confetti.  Will you keep going?  Oh, my God.  This whole Fifth Amendment to the Constitution has got to be removed.  It's a disgrace.  If you're, like, all these guys that robbed all these employees, you've got to testify.  Well, you know what it is?  Again, they're using a Constitution that was written years ago.  Exactly.  And what they meant the Fifth Amendment to be is not incriminating yourself.  That's right.  Based on the theory that here's somebody who's innocent and they should not have to incriminate 
[02:02:30]  themselves on the street.  Exactly.  These people are guilty as shit.  Not in this context, though.  You know what I mean, dog?  It comes out, though.  You know something?  Yeah.  It's all going to come out in the wash.  Oh, yeah.  And these people are going to be in trouble.  But they will go to the country club prisons for a few months.  They'll be playing tennis, yo.  White-collar crime.  Yeah, exactly, dude.  Exactly.  And they've caused more harm, I think.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, any crime is bad, man. 
[02:03:00]  You know?  But this really takes the freaking cake.  You know what I'm saying?  One of the heads of Enron just sold his house in Aspen.  Dude.  The $10 million cottage.  Yeah.  The $10 million cottage.  And that money all came off the backs of the people that worked at Enron and invested  in that company and got aft.  Well, you remember that scumbag Keating, I think, from the Keating loan standard?  From the Keating 5, yeah, man.  He was one of the guys that wanted Larry Flint shut down in Cincinnati.  Right.  They're all such moral, upstanding, great people.  They're all such a-hole, man.  Yet they will fleece and screw over as many people as they can. 
[02:03:30]  Yo, but you know the seriousness of the situation?  You know when I noticed that it was, like, really ill, my brother?  It's like, yo, that cat.  Really ill?  That cat, man, who, yo, he self-murdered himself?  Yeah, the suicide.  Yeah, man.  Yo, you got to really turn around and do a double take, man.  That you're going to kill yourself.  That's how bad the situation is.  That you got to kill yourself.  He took the ultimate fifth.  You know what I'm saying?  Plead the ultimate fifth.  How great is that, though?  He saved the tax payers at trial. 
[02:04:00]  He saved us all money and they should all do it.  Thank you.  You know what I mean?  I love suicide.  All right.  I know, Dave.  All right, baby.  Oh, hold on.  Someone did have something for you real fast.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we were talking about Hispanics dying in car crashes, right?  Andy has something.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, the reason so many Hispanics die in car crashes is because they put 20 of them in a 75 Nova.  So you're saying, like, one car accident can take out 20 times the amount.  Yeah, like half a boot.  All right, I've got to agree with him on that one. 
[02:04:30]  There is actually a point to that.  There is actually a point.  Like, a lot of them drive older cars that don't have the airbags.  The safety features?  Yeah.  Most of them have a half a tire, too.  You think it could be that crown that is on the dashboard as the air freshener might be fatal in a crash?  It's a CD hanging from the mirror that blinds them.  Perhaps you're not able to see through the windows tinted with black paint.  That could be a problem.  When you hit the horn and it goes, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  You can't turn with the link chain steering wheel. 
[02:05:00]  And perhaps the headlights not thrown off enough light when you have the Jesus Christ head stenciled on the front of it.  You can't see through the window louvers in the back.  Or maybe over the spoiler behind you, just in case that Toyota Corolla gets up to 350 miles an hour.  You need the spoiler to keep her on the road.  And it's kind of hard to drive good if the police are always chasing you.  And how can it handle with the shopping cart wheels on the front and back? 
[02:05:30]  Bad handling.  Yeah, we'll forego safety for a little, you know, for style, kid.  I hear you.  All right.  All right, man.  Peace.  Peace, baby.  Bye.  Bye, Norton.  There he goes.  You drive through a local reference here, a Long Island.  You drive through Brentwood, Long Island.  Oh, my God.  That's all you see, a Toyota Corollas.  And if you're lucky, you see a Celica.  They love the Corollas.  The Spanish guys love those Toyota Corollas.  They chop them down so you can barely slide a credit card underneath them. 
[02:06:00]  But they can get under there enough to put the blue neon lights that shine on the road.  Like Close Encounters is coming down the road at you.  Puerto Ricans and Italians should just live together.  Italians are horrific with their cars.  The Italian guys are the worst.  You know what looks great on a black caddy is gold trim, you stupid wop.  You might as well just have the Tarantella playing out the goddamn windows at full blast. 
[02:06:30]  Another race that just has it blacked out.  Yeah, the old IROCs.  Remember that?  Hey, get the IROC.  I'm picking up.  Maybe we're going out.  Get off my car, you whore.  And they got the license plate thing with the girlfriend's name on it or something.  That's awful.  The red chase lights that go around it.  Ugh.  Awful sweatsuit with gold jewelry.  Yeah, yeah.  The Joey Butterfuco look.  Terrible.  The Butterfuco look with the sweatpants. 
[02:07:00]  I love any guy that bangs his wife and then his new lover just...  Maybe if I...  Shoots her...  But I still...  And I love any guy that bangs his wife.  Shut your mouth, Lee.  Thin lips.  You stink.  Weak chin and thin lips and I just couldn't get it right.  He got so pissed at himself.  No, there's 18 cities that just heard me flub.  If it was just us guys in the office, I'd laugh it off and we'd all touch each other.  I love a guy that bangs his wife.  12 years of comedy and that's what I come out with. 
[02:07:30]  No one's listening to this.  A little pink nippled nothing.  You really think people are listening to this joke?  Oh, God.  Hey, when we get back, Brother Joe's got a great Valentine's Day song.  Yes.  Love is in the air.  Yes, it is.  It's a nice little song.  We'll do it next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  He's fighting.  Put more in there.  Put more in there.  Christy is being...  Christy's fighting more.  Which means more.  More.  Oh, my God.  The tank is coming apart.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, that's...  Wow.  Who made that already?  I don't know.  Just clicked on the link.  It's our caricature faces put on the bodies of State of Emergency.  The new game coming out on...  What's it coming out?  Friday?  It comes out Friday.  We got our copies in our hands.  Oh, shh.  Shh.  They made us sign all sorts of paperwork.  And we're not going to give it out or nothing. 
[02:08:30]  I don't understand that.  Because the game comes out Friday.  Is it that big of a deal that we got it two days in advance?  It's just like anything else.  When a new album comes out, they don't want it broken.  I'm going to be busy tonight checking that game out.  Yeah.  We got a sneak peek at State of Emergency.  And I must say, it looks pretty damn cool.  It looks pretty cool, man.  I like the death.  I like the destruction.  It's pretty cool.  You can run around.  One thing that was really cool, you grab pretty much anything in the gaming environment. 
[02:09:00]  So, the guy that was playing it from Rockstar, he was beating people up with chairs.  Like, he'd pick up a wooden bench and just start smashing someone with it.  It's action-packed.  They have, part of the game, they have an arcade version.  Yeah.  Which is pretty much just mayhem.  Run through, kill.  Yeah, you pick a character, run through the streets, and just kill everything in your  sight, more or less.  And then they have another version where you do the missions and stuff.  But they said it's nothing like Grand Theft Auto 3.  No.  It's pretty cool as far as death and destruction goes. 
[02:09:30]  I know there's one part where the law enforcement clones, or whatever the hell they were, were  beating the crap out of this guy, the guy that was playing.  And he's getting pummeled pretty good.  And he's fighting back by punching and kicking.  And I'm watching, kind of going, oh, he's kind of screwed, you know.  He's got about 15 guys on him, just beating him up.  He goes, oh, okay, watch this.  He runs to a machine gun, picks it up, and just spins around once, firing it.  And everyone just goes, oh, oh, God. 
[02:10:00]  Drops down and just puddles some blood.  Blood everywhere.  Very fun.  Yeah, we checked it out for like five, ten minutes.  And so far, you know, it looks pretty cool, multi-level.  You can run through a mall and stuff.  Yeah.  But you're, quote, shooting the bad guys everywhere.  Oh, of course.  That's how they get away with this one.  Geez, if you shoot citizens, I think your score might go down.  Yeah, if you shoot the citizens, your score goes way down.  Oh, does that happen?  Because you're supposed to be fighting the bad guys, the corporate evil bad guys that are  taking over your little city. 
[02:10:30]  The rocket launcher?  That was insane.  And he fired it into the middle of a crowd, and the entire street was just cleared.  Like, they flew up in the air, hit, and killed about 50 to 75 people with one shot.  Just the entire street was gone.  Yeah, the flamethrower was pretty good, too.  Oh, yeah.  He's just running around setting guys on fire.  Ah!  Ah!  You get extra points if you pick up the chairs and stuff and throw them through the store  window.  Yeah, like there's a part where you get extra points for destroying things. 
[02:11:00]  So you pick up, like a sword will be laying there.  You just pick it up and start smashing windows and bashing apart cars.  It's like rioting.  Virtual rioting, Norton.  How many points do you get if you just fold the chair and put it away?  Put it away nicely.  How much do you get for repainting the front of a store and helping out your neighbor?  Maybe helping the Asian.  Shut up, Mr. Chess.  It's no, yeah, it's no, ooh, let me slide my pawn over here, but, you know, action-packed 
[02:11:30]  there, Norton, with your chest.  Ooh, the bishop moves on an angle.  Whoa!  Check?  Oh.  Oh, he didn't say mate.  I still got a chance.  Oh, you have to say check.  He moved his king, darn.  Ooh, check again.  I still got a chance, though.  He didn't say mate.  Where is it?  I gotta find my out.  And don't move that king before your castle, else it removes your option.  Right, gang?  Let me just tip my king over.  I resign.  You're such a nerd, Jim.  I've seen it in the movies. 
[02:12:00]  Never did it.  Yeah, and incidentally, that Searching of Bobby Fischer was a great film.  Oh, please.  Although, in real life, the game was a draw.  It was not a win.  Oh, and who doesn't know that?  For a little Josh Waitskin?  Oh, God.  Little Josh.  L-I-L.  Oil.  Dawn is very mad at us today.  What's the matter, Dawn?  Dawn, where are you calling from?  From Cleveland.  Cleveland.  All right, what's up, Dawn?  What's the problem?  Okay, why are you guys making fun of Italian people?  Because we are the best race there possibly could be. 
[02:12:30]  I am making severe fun of the driving habits with the Irocs and the black caddies with the gold.  You're stereotyping.  With the goddamn gold trim.  But you're stereotyping.  You are stereotyping.  Yeah.  Would you get a hold of yourself, please, and relax?  Just get a hold of yourself.  Yeah.  Anthony, you're Italian, right?  Dawn, wax your arms.  Yeah.  Come on, Anthony.  You're Italian, right?  Yeah.  Carry a guy who hits you.  Call your mother.  Make soup.  And don't complain. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, Dawn.  You guys are sick.  Dawn, could you please answer me honestly when I ask you this?  Oh, I'll try.  All right.  How long ago did you wax your mustache?  I don't have a mustache.  See, there you go, stereotyping.  Because you waxed it, right?  Dawn.  I mean, have you moved out of your mother's house?  Because if we get down to it, all Italian men live with their mother until they're like, what, 40?  See?  Look, you're stereotyping.  See, isn't stereotyping fun?  I'm not stereotyping Italian women. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, watch that language.  Hey, hey, potty mouth.  Boy, you got a potty mouth.  Yeah, you can't say that, Dawn.  We said earlier in the show, we love stereotyping on this show.  We'll openly admit it.  Don't run to your father, the killer.  We enjoy the stereotyping.  Goddamn, the FBI don't respect nothing.  Okay, true enough.  True enough.  But not all Italian people drive.  I'll smack you, you spoiled brat. 
[02:14:00]  You spoiled brat.  Gimme, brat.  I love Carlo.  Hey, Sonny took care of him.  Hello, Carlo.  Hello, Carlo.  When Sonny started beating him with the garbage pail lid and then his own shoe.  Oh, classic.  That was absolutely great.  Then he has sex with Lucy up in the beginning.  He has sex with Lucy against the door.  Yeah, he's just banging her against the door.  You know what else is great?  When Carlo is beating on Talia Shire. 
[02:14:30]  Talia Shire.  Picks up the shoe.  And she starts sliding plates and throwing plates and he just goes,  Clean this up!  At first, she's going, go ahead!  Go ahead!  Go ahead!  What, you're going to kill me?  You're a murderer like your father?  She's holding the knife.  It's Bocini.  When he kicked the door in the bathroom door, you just hear this smacking and the screaming.  Oh, that's classic.  With his belt, right?  Yeah.  Pulls the belt off. 
[02:15:00]  Come here!  Little skinny brat.  What a great movie.  A couple of instant feedbacks.  We were talking about the top three ways, you know, Whitey dies and the black man dies.  Yes.  And the Hispanics die.  Well, Well Hung from New Orleans, he wanted to guess the number four.  Oh, number four.  Yeah, the list only had three.  The fourth way Latinos die.  Well Hung writes, is the number four way Latinos leaky inner tubes? 
[02:15:30]  No, those are Cubans.  Oh, you stink.  Did I stumble through that one?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Catching what Jim Norton has today.  Yeah, great joke written out.  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.  I know.  Why?  One thing, you can tell jokes like a man.  Godfather, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I need this movie.  What am I going to do?  I forget my punchlines. 
[02:16:00]  I haven't written material in a while.  I say black jokes.  Stop crying.  Stop.  Well, one day you're going to act like a man.  I love that.  And you did it right, thank God, because we don't need Dice calling today.  Godfather.  Two more miles, we'd have all the oil.  He's not even here to defend himself.  By a dry end door.  Well, he can call in if he wants my Kraut McFriend.  Is Moss in rehab or something?  Because we haven't heard from him in a while. 
[02:16:30]  He's all right?  He's in London.  Listen, I don't care how many of you Guinea greaseballs come out of the woodwork.  I'm German-Irish.  Let me try this again.  Kraut McFriend.  I'm going to try it again.  I'm sorry.  T-Bucket from C-Town.  Hispanics die in car accidents because they can't drive with handcuffs on.  Ah, that old gag.  And we're talking about the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We're looking for things we could drop in the barrel. 
[02:17:00]  Hugo from Philly writes,  How about Tippy Toms or any other contestant from the Homeless Shopping Spree's nasty underwear?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's not a bad idea.  Oh.  Yeah, who's going to get it?  Whatever, man.  We all have to make sacrifices for good radio.  Drop that in the barrel just to make her look ridiculous.  Jersey Bob saying, 
[02:17:30]  Wasn't the working title for State of Emergency the Puerto Rican Day Parade?  Wow.  Local reference.  Ding, ding, ding.  Well, last year's Puerto Rican Day Parade was very peaceful.  It wasn't the rape and carnage of two years back.  What did you think of the game?  Two years back.  Huh?  What did you think of the game?  I've got to sit and play it.  Yeah, because I want to see what the missions are all about.  Yeah, I've got to sit and play it.  I think the arcade version could get old after a while.  Well, if you're into one of the arcade versions of games, I think it's cool.  You could get your aggression out, but I'm hoping the missions are kind of cool. 
[02:18:00]  I don't think we saw enough of it, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  You know, I kind of like the idea of going around with weapons and killing people.  We dig Spanky.  Spanky's good.  The big fat.  Spanky rules.  He's the big fat Spanish homie guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Many of you listeners, when you get this game, you're going to be calling us saying,  You're right.  Spanky rules.  Spanky rules.  He's running around, waddles, his belly shakes from side to side, and he shoots his gun  sideways, which is just a great little touch.  I think he's a fat Hispanic character, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's like a gang guy. 
[02:18:30]  Because it's funny, because, what do you call it, Jennifer from Rockstar was explaining  to me after you guys left that they debuted the game in L.A., and a bunch of homies came  by, a bunch of Hispanic guys, and they're all looking at the character going, Yo, blee,  that's me, that's me, look, looks like me.  And they all had the same outfits on.  The same look, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jessica.  Jessica, what's up there, Norton?  Nothing.  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi, Norton.  Oh, hello.  How are you?  I'm fine, ma'am.  Thank you.  How are you?  I'm good.  Ooh.  Takeledraker.com.  No, takeledraker.aol.com. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I want to be in the drum challenge.  I'm the worst.  You want to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Yes.  All right.  You know what's going on?  Mm-hmm.  Because these are special spots in the challenge.  Oh, no.  I understand that.  So, we're looking for ladies to come down and show off what they got for us.  You know, you got to do something a little twisted, a little demented.  Okay.  Well, I thought of something.  By the way, we have, is that girl coming down tomorrow, Rick?  I'm not sure.  Stinky spoke to her.  All right.  Well, you guys will check.  The girl's going to come down, hopefully tomorrow, do a headstand and do some yellow discipline 
[02:19:30]  on herself.  Ah.  That would impress us enough to give her a spot in the challenge.  You hold her up, give her a hug, and if your face happens to go into that area, well,  so be it.  What the hey-ho.  What the hey-ho.  Hey, so what would you do, Jessica?  Okay.  Well, a lot of the talent that I have involves using my mouth.  So what I'm going to have to do is, I know you were talking about pouring beer before.  Yeah, yeah.  So what I was thinking is, if you lay Norton down and pour, cover some Sam Adams on him, 
[02:20:00]  I'll be happy to lick it off.  And that's sick and demented.  It's fun for Jimmy.  It's always Norton.  Son of a bitch.  I would let out.  Son of a bitch.  Wow.  Oh, that's so good.  It really is.  When he bites his hand over, he hangs the phone up.  Oh.  That's really good.  Oh, that's so funny.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Well, Norton would enjoy it, but I, you know, you've got to think of the show sometimes.  It has to be that somebody has to enjoy it.  I mean, look, you goddamn radio hosts really make me laugh.  Jessica, we really need something more twisted and demanding.  More twisted and demanding and leaking stuff of Norton?  Would you like to lick jelly out of my cheeks?  Sure.  We should have someone smell your belly button.  That's disgusting enough right there.  I guarantee somebody will dry heave.  I won't wash it.  Jessica, you know what? 
[02:21:00]  I'll wash his ears worse.  As far as it goes with Jim, he's relatively clean.  So, I mean, we're looking for something a little more twisted.  A little more twisted?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a pervert, but I'm clean as far as my body is clean.  It wouldn't be gross to lick beer off me if you could get over the visual of my fat,  pale, awful little fish belly.  Aw.  Jim doesn't want too many people to know that he's a germaphobe.  Not really a germaphobe.  I touched a stupid bun at the airport, you know, his chicken sandwich, and you freaked  out.  Oh, no. 
[02:21:30]  That was a little.  No, no, here's what it is.  Me and him, we're sitting there, right, eating.  I want to see if it looked good enough to eat before I get my own.  He grabs my chicken bun and he opens it and goes, how is that?  You don't want another gentleman touching your bun?  No, no, no.  I've seen a guy who talks about, you know, having sex with hookers without condoms.  Women.  Dude, hey, look, if a girl one time dropped a little yellow treat in a cup and by golly,  I drank it because that's the type of good guy I am.  Another guy who's going to stand there and hold his mule at a urinal, I don't want touching 
[02:22:00]  my sandwich bun.  True, very true.  I don't know why I was holding my mule at the urinal.  Well, how do you go?  Of course you have to hold your mule.  Mm-hmm.  You have to.  Yeah.  Unless you're lucky and you have someone with you.  All right, Jessica, we've got to be tough with this qualifying.  Okay.  So why don't you think about it overnight and call us back tomorrow?  Oh, I will, definitely.  We're looking for sick and twisted, something that'll impress us and we'll go, okay, here  you go.  We'll give you a spot in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Okay.  Let's see one of those.  Oh, my God.  Are these the publicity items they're handing out? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  These are great.  They are actual police batons, billy clubs, with a little side handle, too, with state of  emergency.  Wait, these are real.  Yeah, these are real, all right.  I thought it was going to be a little plastic.  No, no.  These are the real deal, man.  This is like what the boss man carries around.  Oh, this is great.  Bam.  Bam.  Well, I really don't know you well enough to...  Oh.  Wow.  These are heavy duty. 
[02:23:00]  They're authentic.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Rich.  Yeah, man.  What up, Rich?  What's going on?  Yeah, I listen to you.  I'm a black dude.  I think that's obvious.  I listened to y'all for about three years.  This is the first time I actually heard some really bad stereotypical jokes other than black  guys.  It was magnificent.  Yeah, we're trying to spread the love there.  Yeah.  We'll share the hatred with other groups.  Of course, absolutely.  Well, every race group has their dopey stereotypes. 
[02:23:30]  And you know something?  I'm sorry.  They're based in some fact.  Yeah.  That's why they're noticed as stereotypes.  And it's everybody.  Italians, blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans, Asians, Irish, Arabs.  Arabs, yeah.  Arabs love to blow up airplanes and kill white people.  And they hate to shower.  Maybe there's one or two that don't.  But the stereotype.  Well, hey.  All right.  All right, my brother. 
[02:24:00]  All right, man.  Peace.  All right, let's play Brother Joe's song.  Let's play Brother Joe's Valentine's Day.  All right.  Cute little ditty.  Sure.  Sounds like James Taylor.  It does.  It has a James Taylor-ish feel to it, doesn't it?  Remember the last time he sounded like James Taylor?  He was doing, what the hell song is that?  Up in here, up in here.  We should play that again, too.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do that later.  Why don't we do a twofer from Joe here? 
[02:24:30]  A Joe double shot?  Why not?  We'll debut the new one from Joe right now.  All right.  Follow it up with a twofer.  Here's his Valentine's Day song.  A valentine for you, my beautiful wife.  For all of the years and selfless sacrifice.  For knowing how hard you work to keep our family going.  Yeah.  And growing strong.  Send the kids off to school every morning at six. 
[02:25:00]  As I leave for work, you'd throw me a kiss.  But that investigator has paid off at last.  He took pictures of you while I was busting my ass.  The milkman delivered his cream in our bed.  The plumber installed his pipe in your head.  The landscaper was pulling his roof as he clipped your flower for hours. 
[02:25:30]  The carpenter smackled your ass, I don't doubt it.  The paper boy delivered extra, read all about it.  The fool guy was a pumping, a skimmer.  He was checking the suction.  Motherfucker.  The mailman had a very large package for you.  Our auto mechanic gave you a chippy-loo.  Tyrone, our garbage man, talk about integration. 
[02:26:00]  Vital learned a new trick.  The missionary position.  To my wife, you pig, slut, or twat, skanky bitch.  Happy Valentine's Day.  The lawyer's on the way.  Happy Valentine's Day.  The lawyer's on the way.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Happy Valentine's Day. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  Great.  That's not bad.  I got a little tear in my eye there.  That's not bad at all.  Isn't that sweet for Valentine's Day?  I'm like, is this going to be like a real song?  Is it starts like a real serious song?  Of course.  Wow.  There you go.  That's a style of comedy where you wait for the punchline there.  Wondering what's going to happen next.  Poor Joe's playing tonight, and I have no clue where.  He called up earlier.  Call up, Joe.  I'll give you your plug.  That was bar nine last night.  I didn't go.  It was good, though.  You said that song got a great reaction. 
[02:27:00]  Great response.  Yeah.  Here we go.  No.  Sorry.  I can't party it up all the time, Norton, like you.  Hey, that happens to be my favorite Eddie Murphy song.  What?  Do you remember that song?  Do you remember that song?  Matt Gale wants to party all the time.  Party all the time.  You're giving your number to every boy you see.  Bump.  Bump.  Bump.  Oh, that was awful. 
[02:27:30]  I have more respect for him just drinking out of tranny mules in a truck.  Great comic like that with a song.  The video's even better when you watch the video.  That was just 80s written all over him trying to be a serious.  He wasn't satisfied being the hugest comic of that time.  Absolutely.  You know?  It just kills me when these people cannot just accept what they do,  accept that you're very talented and successful at it,  and you don't have to be a goddamn singer.  You know, he's like Michael Jackson or something. 
[02:28:00]  He thought he was...  Dude, it's got to be hard, too, to take everything Richard Pryor did and, you know, update it.  Is this it?  Oh, yeah.  Who got this?  Wow.  I think the Tom Clips are going to fit in nice here.  I party all the time with Tommy.  I love you guys.  I feel like I've known you forever.  Wasn't the American skater skating to this last night?  Dude, I bring an ice chest everywhere. 
[02:28:30]  Okay.  Woo!  Woo!  My bad.  My bad.  Insane.  The kicks on chicks ain't cheating.  Big, long 80s intro.  Why you gonna hurt me?  Oh, God.  P.U.  After all of the things I've done for you.  Hey, Rick.  We're gonna go back to our house.  We got a hot tub, baby. 
[02:29:00]  I buy your separate glasses.  Put down and hold your finger.  Jesus Christ.  We're in New Orleans, man.  If you sit here, hang out all night.  What am I to do?  Here it comes.  What am I to do?  Party all the time.  Party all the time.  Party all the time.  Ah!  Party all the time.  Party all the time.  Ah!  Ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh. 
[02:29:30]  I had no problem with that.  She likes to party all the time.  Party all the time.  Woo!  Woo!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  We rule, man.  Dude, I'm bringing ice chest everywhere.  I don't know about it.  Those men want to have sex with me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You gotta do it.  You gotta do it.  You gotta do it.  Woo!  All right, I've had about as much as I could take of this. 
[02:30:00]  Look at, look at Earl dancing.  Earl dancing.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  I'm over here now.  What's a couple of cold ones?  I'm over here now.  Ouch.  Turn it off.  I'll get you anything you need.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  Lordy, Lord.  Keep jumping. 
[02:30:30]  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Turn it off.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, there it is.  We'll turn it off.  A little blast from the past there.  All right.  Eddie Murphy.  We'll turn it off there.  That clip makes me laugh harder than anything.  That's yours.  Oh, yeah.  Turn it off.  We try to come up with better clips, but that one is the...  That's the funniest.  Yeah, yeah.  The movie.  When you watch that movie and he is sitting in that theater chair watching his daughter  being tag-teamed by two guys, his sweet, innocent, church-going daughter just 
[02:31:00]  hobbing a knob and getting it from the back, and he's squirming in his seat.  It's painful.  Yeah.  Turn it off.  And he just starts all...  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  He's shaking, convulsing, and then he's just reduced the tears.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Please.  Oh, God, please turn it off.  That movie is hilarious.  It is funny.  It is really funny.  It was, like, supposed to be serious at the time.  It was like, oh, my God, this is an amazing, serious movie.  You watch it now.  It's such a goof when he plays the porn producer, director, auditioning the guys. 
[02:31:30]  It was on last night.  It was on last night?  Not on regular TV.  No, I think it was either Encore or one of the other cable channels.  All uninterrupted.  No beeping.  No nothing.  Here's one of the guys he was interviewing.  Really, though.  This is the clip from it.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Remember when Big Dick Black came in?  Oh, is that where that's from?  Yeah, but he was looking for two white guys that were either one of the two white guys  that were tag-teaming his daughter so he could get info where his daughter is.  So he knew it wasn't a black guy.  So it was just a waste of time interviewing him, posing as a director. 
[02:32:00]  So the guy came in.  I'm Big Dick Black.  And he goes, well, I'm not going to need you.  You're not necessarily.  And he goes, you don't want to hire any niggas.  That's all.  So he got all pissed off.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I got the whole clip here, do you?  I'm Dick Black.  You're doing a porno movie, right?  Right.  Then I'm the man for you.  I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Black, but I'm afraid you're not exactly the type we're looking for.  You mean because I'm black?  No, he's just not the type.  What do you mean, not the type? 
[02:32:30]  Man, don't you know who I am?  I'm Big Dick Black.  I've done more porno movies than you ever saw.  I work with Harry Reams, Johnny Wise.  Not the type?  I can f*** ten times a day.  I can keep it hard for two hours at a time.  I'm a woman's dream.  I got a f*** hung on me nine inches long.  I'm sorry, Mr. Black.  I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I just don't have anything for you.  If something comes up, I'll be happy to give you a call.  S***.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all. 
[02:33:00]  I knew this was a scam.  This is bulls***.  This is bulls***.  That was Earl in his first dramatic role.  All right, let's...  God, is that classic.  I mean, we have to take a break.  Wow.  Brother Joe, real fast.  What's up, bro?  Really quick, yeah, we're doing the Evolution thing.  It's a Journey tribute band over at 511 Greenwich.  The club's called Don Hills.  Hugo, Valenti, John Cappadona, me, and a couple other dudes.  Going to be doing that tonight at 10.30.  10.30 tonight?  What's the name of the place?  It's called Don Hills. 
[02:33:30]  It's on Greenwich Street right off Spring down in Soho.  It's not a gay place, is it?  On Friday and Saturday night, yes, it is.  Very gay.  You might want to come down and do your skating commentary.  Yeah, sure.  Do it live.  Oh, by the way, the old man, his apparition came to me in the living room and said,  if you keep talking about that, he's going to disown you as a son.  Yeah, sure.  Why, you don't watch the Olympics?  I watch the Olympics.  I just don't watch that gay ass.  Right.  All right, Brother Joe, we've got to fly. 
[02:34:00]  Thanks a lot, fellas.  Bye, Joe.  Great new song, by the way.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, that song's up on foundrymusic.com.  Before we leave today, we'll play Brother Joe's other song, the remake of DMX as he sings  it.  Yes.  As you can tell, it's really funny.  Have I helped you in belief?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Just squeeze it through.  Squeeze it through.  Squeeze it through.  Oh, my God.  It's another kiss.  That was a whopper.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:34:30]  And we're back.  Yeah.  O.P. and Anthony.  Earl has spent the entire day, the entire day here at WNEW doing what?  Doing what?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Working?  No.  Anybody?  Anybody?  Wearing black?  Well, that he does every day. 
[02:35:00]  Ben, do you know?  Running from the cops?  No.  No.  No.  The entire day here at this station.  What has he done?  Getting heart disease, getting shot, getting HIV.  Oh, no.  We learned that that was the three leading causes of death in black men.  Breeding a future Olympic athlete?  No.  No.  No.  It'll be summer Olympic athlete.  Please.  Let's keep it straight.  I didn't say winner.  Okay.  Okay.  True.  There it is. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, he's an animal anyway, so let him lose his soul.  Oh, my God.  Just keep it up, Tom, with those people.  It's from The Godfather.  Exactly.  Godfather.  Ever since I was a young Negro, I've played the silver ball.  Got my quickness back.  From Soho to Jamaica, Forest Hills, and through Forest Hills, I must have played them all. 
[02:36:00]  But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall.  This black man, I play a darn good pinball.  You don't?  What a coincidence.  He's playing the Terminator pinball game, and we can't terminate you.  Oh.  I played the silver ball.  I do nothing else at work, so I might as well play pinball. 
[02:36:30]  But they can't fire me because of court of laws.  Sure, play, I mean, pinball all day long.  That's right, Earl.  I'll stand like a statue even when I'm not playing pinball.  Because I'm doing nothing else, so I might as well play pinball.  I haven't checked the public file.  Too busy playing pinball.  What am I going to do today?  I'm a Negro playing pinball. 
[02:37:00]  There has to be a twist.  Ball wizard.  Full wrist and weak knees.  It's inbred in my people.  How do you think I do anything?  I don't know.  Ain't got no distractions.  I don't hear no buzzes and bells because I'm asleep. 
[02:37:30]  Always get a replay because I got the key and I just hit free game.  I'm a pinball Negro.  There has to be a twist.  A pinball Negro.  There has to be a twist.  There has to be a twist.  There has to be a twist.  Oh, well.  All right, Earl. 
[02:38:00]  How are you doing?  How's the high score?  Kev has the big high score.  He's got 237 million.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to practice a little more.  Acting lessons, pinball lessons.  I was going to make them a big song.  Can I ask you, Earl, who sings that song?  I've heard it.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Are you being honest here now?  Don't be silly.  Hey, hey, don't knock it. 
[02:38:30]  I'm not lying and I'm not being silly.  Actually.  I've heard the song.  Don't be silly.  Is it The Who or The Farner?  All right.  The Who or The Farner?  The Farner.  The Farner.  Farner?  Wait, you think it's Farner or The Who?  I was thinking the jukebox here are the only song by them that I like.  That white trash band.  The Who is the most overrated band in the history of rock.  Holy Jesus.  Wow.  You know all those fans you just made for the last year and a half?  Let me tell you something.  No, I didn't.  A lot of them are under 45 and don't have mullets and bad mustaches.  They're not all Who fans. 
[02:39:00]  The Who is a hugely successful, great band from, and they have been around so long.  I am catching their 80th reunion or 80th farewell tour in August.  Aren't they?  They're touring in August, right?  Yes.  I'll be there.  How are they overrated?  Just that little pinball.  It's awful.  That song is ancient.  Exactly.  You know, it's exactly my point.  That's 68?  Nine.  69.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's from a rock opera, though. 
[02:39:30]  Come on.  It's from Tommy.  That's what I'm saying.  The rock opera bugs me.  It was a great thing.  Put together very well.  A little acid, you know, influence.  It was a good concept.  Exactly.  It was a good concept.  Not many rock operas were that good.  Quadrophenia?  Did you like quadrophenia?  Jimbo, bottle that acid.  I just don't like it.  God.  Wow.  Didn't Styx try that rock opera thing?  Yeah, well, some people should just leave that concept alone. 
[02:40:00]  Maybe Robert Daltrey could sing Mr. Roboto.  Or Roger Daltrey.  One or the other.  Robert, his brother.  I didn't mean to do that.  Oh, Paul Townsend's a great guitarist.  God, I like garbage.  I really do.  Wow.  I am amazed that you don't appreciate the music of the Who.  There's something I like.  Because I would think you're kind of a classic rocker.  No, I'm not.  Well, more than a modern rock guy.  More than a newer music guy.  Sabbath?  Sabbath.  Zeppelin I liked.  They were overrated.  All right.  Well, there's two classics.  Zeppelin overrated. 
[02:40:30]  Zeppelin overrated.  Are you insane?  I'll tell you why.  Not by the listeners or the fans.  By critics who love them so much.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  They're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, right?  Dude, they got panned by more critics.  Doesn't matter.  They're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which is what the critics provide.  Sabbath will never get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  And Stairway to Heaven's a wonderful song, but every year it wins Best Ross  on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which it's not.  I don't even think Led Zeppelin is proud of Stairway to Heaven.  Dude, I love Zeppelin.  They're a great band, but they're overrated in comparison with Sabbath.  Don't embarrass us.  I'm not.  It's true.  You are a Sabbath fan.  You're a Sabbath fan who's bitter that Sabbath never got the success of 
[02:41:00]  Zeppelin, The Who, The Stones.  And what do you think the reasoning is on that?  It's not because they're not as good.  I listen to them conceptually and musically.  It's because they were dark and the critics didn't go for that.  Because you look at the type of you, The Who?  Oh, come on.  They're not better than Sabbath.  They're not better than Sabbath.  Very good band.  Daltry is a fine singer, but he's not better than Ozzy.  I mean, he's a better singer, but he's not more interesting.  Nobody cares about rock opera.  I want to hear Iron Man.  When you look at successive bands, sometimes you've just got to look at it in success. 
[02:41:30]  You're right.  And Carrot Top's a successful comic, but you can't put him on the level of prior  Carlin Bill Hicks.  You know, Friends is a very successful show, but Friends is not The Honeymooners.  Are you trying to compare Led Zeppelin to Carrot Top?  No, not at all.  No, I'm not.  I think for a second we've got them.  I'm not.  No.  Because we do have these Billy Clubs, and I swear to God.  No, and I like Zeppelin.  And he's buying a call with 1-800-CALLE.  No, don't get me wrong.  I like them, and I think that having them sing would be great to draw gamblers to the casino.  I'm not saying I don't like Zeppelin. 
[02:42:00]  I would like to continue seeing how inept you are.  How am I inept?  I made a good point.  We messed up this show so bad, we've got to take another break.  Damn it.  And we're going to come back with a little round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Son of a bitch!  Did we do the FU line today?  Let's do a...  My favorite, Sonny.  Let's go to the FU line.  And we'll be back with what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, my FU has to do with all these people that wear these goddamn f***ing stretch pants.  Alright, if you can't squeeze into something, don't do it.  Yeah, I can't fit 10 pounds of potatoes in a 5-pound bag.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big f*** you to that f***less, motherless, piece of f*** holding  17 of my fellow students at Fairfield Hostage.  Buddy, f*** you.  You're going down, pal. 
[02:43:00]  F*** you.  Next message.  This f*** you is the French Olympus, this f***ing motherf***ing frog.  Go back to France, school.  Next message.  I want to give a big FU out to all those people in Boston who think that the Patriots are their  team.  They're called the New England Patriots, you effing idiot.  New England, not Boston Patriots.  FU Boston.  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:43:30]  Oh my God, what is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  N-E-W.  It's time to play.  What did we learn on The Opie and Anthony Show today?  Yes.  We love this feature.  It's definitely a benchmark of our radio show. 
[02:44:00]  We learned about benchmarks today.  It's a benchmark.  Other shows, they have benchmarks like Soap for Tuesday, the 5 o'clock Funnies, the Workforce  Blocks.  That's a benchmark.  Right.  They have benchmarks like 55-gallon drum challenge, the 6 o'clock Brief.  Look at Rich from Philly.  Norton's Talking Sense.  Page is overrated.  Iommi is very underrated. 
[02:44:30]  Plus, Sabbath's still putting out albums, you dumbasses.  Norton rules.  Virgins are cool.  What Sabbath is putting out albums?  How many original friggin' members of Black Sabbath are there?  These are Tony, Bill.  They got back with Ozzy recently.  They did a couple of great songs on the reunion album, which was Kick Ass, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Just ask him.  Yeah, Sabbath is tough.  It just seems to me like when Sabbath tours, you're not seeing the Sabbath that you would  have seen years ago.  Yes.  Well, Bill Ward is fatter.  He's had two heart attacks.  Iommi is still playing great.  Gies is still playing great. 
[02:45:00]  Ozzy is still Ozzy, man.  It's great.  Look, Page and Plant knew when to fade away, my friend.  Yeah, when Bonham died.  It's kind of hard to go on tour when the drummer's in a box.  The Who had...  It's not true.  They could have went on.  The Who had some success.  It's not too hard to replace a drummer, my friend.  Um...  After Keith Moon died, The Who had some success in it.  Well, Bill Ward, some of their best years.  Look, I'm not saying that Zeppelin was...  I don't say Jimmy Page was a bad guitarist.  He was a great guitarist.  And Bonham was an amazing drummer.  I'm just saying that Bill Ward...  You know what?  I'll say that Robert Plant sucked as a singer. 
[02:45:30]  Exactly.  Me too.  Live, he was awful.  I think he went through about maybe two years where he could sing where it kind of  resembled Led Zeppelin that you'd hear on the album.  But for the most part, live, he sucked.  He couldn't hit those goddamn notes.  There's no way.  Those awful tight jeans, rotten little mule huggers.  Well, I want some good parts.  Okay.  Good parts.  I mean...  Hey, we got some great...  What did we learn today?  At least Ozzy's kids are still around. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, wow.  Hold.  Hold.  I couldn't breathe for a second.  I couldn't breathe for a second when you said that.  You awful, awful little man.  Could be one of the worst, most heinous, horrendous things you've ever said.  Let's all just sit and take a breath.  Doesn't beat the worst thing ever said on this radio show, though.  Exactly.  That goes to Kimmy from Survivor 2, asking Pete Best if he laughed uncontrollably when  John Lennon got shot. 
[02:46:30]  Joe West, what's up?  Yo, Opie and Anthony, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, I learned one thing today.  And Norton's been doing comedy for 12 years, but still can't get a joke straight.  Damn it.  I think you're right, sir.  It's Caroline, Brian.  What's up?  Hey, how are you?  I learned two things today.  I learned that you guys still haven't learned not to discuss music with Norton.  Yeah, I know.  That's one.  And I learned that Anthony blew off his brother's gig last night to watch male figure skating. 
[02:47:00]  Very good.  Thank you, Caroline.  You're welcome.  Kevin, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  I learned that extreme gayness is also called uber gay.  Uber gay.  And I just learned something else while I was on hold.  Yes.  You can have a drummer that can drum with one arm, but when he's in a box, it doesn't work.  Very good.  Make it easy.  All right.  A lot of what do we learn is coming in today.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  I learned a couple things.  Yeah.  Anthony mixes vodka with his Zima to take away the pain of man junk in his balloon knot. 
[02:47:30]  You ass.  I hope he thinks there's something about Boy George.  And figure skating all started with an uncle, a knuckle, and a tear-stained pillow.  Very good, man.  God damn.  Good job, Doug.  That guy learned more than he did in college, bro.  And I think we should stop there because he nailed it.  Fonzo, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Fonzo?  Fonzo.  Where Fonzie was taken? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I learned that Norton has AIDS just for the show.  Very good, Fonzo.  These guys are killing today.  Chris, what's going on, man?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned Ron and Fez just flew back from England, and they got caught smoking crack in the bathroom.  And just a reminder, you've got to watch The Job.  Oh, The Job tonight, 9.30 on ABC.  We're going to be watching, checking out that WOW sticker and all that fun stuff.  Tonight.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, and Ron and Fez are up next here in New York. 
[02:48:30]  We love those guys.  Yes.  Oh, here's the Kimmy Pete Best thing.  God, Rick.  Oh, wow.  Rick's good.  Check this out.  I think this was the worst thing ever since.  Very uncomfortable moment.  I want to ask him a question.  Sure.  Thank Kimmy from Survivor.  I want to know, like, when John Lennon got shot, were you kind of like, ha-ha?  Whoa, Kimmy.  Oh, my God.  Kimmy, Kimmy, Kimmy's not sick.  Kimmy comes out with the worst goddamn question ever.  Oh, come on.  Pete, once again, I want to apologize because we don't even know this girl. 
[02:49:00]  And she comes out with some kind of a wacky off the wall.  Look, Stinky can't even take it.  You know, we just found a brand new member of the show, though.  Did she get hotter asking that question?  No boundaries with this chick.  None.  Oh, my God.  Pete, please, again, let me apologize for that question.  My God.  Now, if Yoko would have been hit.  That would have been a treat.  Did you have any communication with the guys after you were 62?  Yeah, I saw them a couple of times.  Yeah?  And what was it like? 
[02:49:30]  No.  No.  What was the rest of the day, right?  Yeah, it goes out for a while.  What happened with Kimmy?  She's not around anymore.  No.  Hey, what did happen with Kimmy?  She choked on a ha.  I don't know what happened, sir.  I believe she choked on a ha.  Ha ha.  Taking it in dust on potty, Harry.  All right.  Big Ted.  Yeah, he had to remind me of this.  I said that, yeah, I thought Plant New went to bow out. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  And Big Ted wants to remind me, remember the Honey Trippers?  The Honey Trippers.  Do you remember?  Oh, please.  Yeah, that's right.  Redo a Phil Phillips song.  All right.  And Big Ted learned that Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Old Hogan will be wrestling at the pay-per-view  this weekend.  Ha ha ha.  I learned today a figure skate...  Oh, we did that one.  Okay.  Nate from Cleveland.  I learned today that all white people have extremely faggity and pathetic ways to die.  Matt from Boston learned that you don't need a paper bag on an airplane. 
[02:50:30]  Very good.  Very true.  Tom writes, I learned today eight things.  Black people watch soap operas during the day because they do not work.  Oh, stupid.  Interior decorators are gay.  Carpenters are not.  Right.  Comics that know the names of the singers in the village people are really gay.  Four, a weatherman on Channel 7 News wears a scarf while driving in the spring.  Number five, his and cockroaches come from Madagascar.  Madagascar.  Anthony likes his steak medium rare.  He also learned Spanish people are too busy selling the snow to be in the Winter Olympics. 
[02:51:00]  And he also learned Spanky Rules.  Spanky Rules.  You'll see for yourself soon.  Spanky Rules.  Howie from Buffalo.  I learned today, Opie doesn't need to hold his own mule while tinkling.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Teresa from Key West.  I learned today, Norton doesn't.  Are we on in Key West?  What the hell?  No.  Underground.  It's indication underground.  All right.  I learned today, Norton doesn't like Opie touching his buns. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, Wiggy from New Hampshire.  I learned not to move my king first or I'll lose my option.  Wow.  Yeah, huh?  How did he not already know that?  Look at you.  You are a snob.  I think you're a wannabe snob, though.  You don't quite have the snobdom, so you just pick one area like chess and then like puff  that up like it's everything snob.  You're right.  You just nailed me.  I'm not smart enough or educated enough to be a real snob, so I pick one thing that I  know about. 
[02:52:00]  One snob-like thing and then just push it on people like, oh, you don't play chess?  You don't know that?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Exactly.  And that makes up for the fact that you have unprotected sex with tranny hookers and a  balloon knot.  Yes.  And a weak chin to go with it.  To boot.  To boot.  To boot.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Today I learned that the leading cause of death in Puerto Ricans from age five to nine  is unplanned pregnancy.  It is?  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, it says, Norton, you rule. 
[02:52:30]  I was at your show.  Son of a bitch.  And that tool who was ringing the bell every time you said something.  Oh, thanks, man.  You are God.  ONA, you guys rule.  All right.  Thank you.  Later on.  Well, Anthony, we got to leave the show with this.  Clearly going.  Instead of doing a couple more minutes of hilarity with the What Did I Learn segment, we have  to do a giveaway for Bucky.  Bucky, this is for you, you douchebag.  Bucky, douchebag, Bucky, douchebag, Bucky.  Wow.  No, I don't like this talk of Bucky, and if he should hang himself in his jail cell. 
[02:53:00]  Douchebag.  I'll be struck by a bolt of lightning.  What happened there?  Stop calling our boss and trying to get us in trouble, you douchebag.  Who did that?  Wait, I don't know what's going on.  Douchebag.  Who's Bucky?  Bucky sells time to this radio show, and he's trying to get us in trouble, going, hey, the  guys promised that they would give away gift certificates for proflowers.com.  Ken, what the F is going on?  It's not about you, douchebag.  Trying to get us in trouble.  How are you going to get in trouble?  Trouble?  We're not in high school, Bucky, you douchebag. 
[02:53:30]  If it wasn't for you, this is a 10th floor Wendy's.  How much trouble are you going to get into?  Trouble.  Ass.  What, are you going to get fired?  Wow.  Ooh.  Didn't know that was going on.  Well, Buckster picks up the phone.  Before we came along, you had to start throwing around some weight.  You had to sell spots for a show that played Rock Block, so why don't you relax, douchebag?  Oh, promise.  Oh.  Hey, it's time for commercials.  I love them. 
[02:54:00]  That's from Grand Theft Auto 3.  That certainly is.  Where did that come from?  I forgot we had that.  It was sitting there.  So, how many of these can we give away?  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  We got four to give away.  Wow, man.  Can I have one?  Hello, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Wow, thanks, Bucky.  Four whole gift certificates.  For flowers?  Right.  I'd do the math.  Just in time for Valentine's Day.  Perfect.  A $200 value.  Thank you, Bucky.  Hey, I've got to go.  Bucky's on the phone. 
[02:54:30]  Bucky's on the phone.  This was worth stopping our show today for you, douchebag.  Bucky's on the phone.  Hold on.  Here's Bucky.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I don't know this Bucky.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to give away the flowers.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  I'm calling Ken.  I don't know that.  Oh, that's great.  Save the phone call next time.  Ken doesn't care. 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  Ken's not going to have a little meeting with Ant and I about not giving away gift certificates,  Bucky.  All right, we've got four people that are going to win a $50 gift certificate to proflowers.com,  Anthony.  We love proflowers.com.  We love proflowers.com.  No reflection on Bucky.  Bucky?  Hey, Bucky.  We're changed for nothing!  For the freshest flowers, call 1-888-FRESHEST or go to proflowers.com. 
[02:55:30]  But we've got $50 gift certificates for like four random callers right now.  Hey, can I get some free flowers or something?  You might be able to.  Sure.  Well, I didn't know that was going on, Opie.  Yeah, Bucky thinks he's still dealing with like a Penn Darvish or something.  Did he really call Ken Stevens?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, we've got to get off?  Yeah, we've got to go.  All right, thanks for listening today.  Yes, that was a lot of fun.  That chick is coming in tomorrow to try to qualify for the 55-gallon drum show. 
[02:56:00]  Try.  She does this.  She's in.  She's in.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Call the Park Central New York for their Valentine's weekend special,  a lunchroom, champagne, even a comma suture, a weekend, or kit for romance.  1-800-346-1359.  The Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
