<pre> Alright, here it comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Kool and the Human Show.  1027, WNEW.  Hey, I'm John Stewart and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027, WNEW.  These guys have problems, but you know that.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level too low that you guys won't stick to.  That is the final level.  Please stop.  1027, WNEW. 
[00:30]
 Okay, terrific. 
[01:00]
 Hey, hey, hey! 
[01:30]
 Okay, terrific.  Alright, another way to kick off the show. 
[02:00]
 Another way to kick off the show.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, we're rockin'. 
[02:30]
 Never hear an Un-Village people out here.  Oh yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's the O-Day Show!  Any guy he can.  Alright.  Lick my bone.  Well, what's up, Anthony? 
[03:00]
 Hey, man.  It's the O-Day Show.  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony.  Beautiful day.  It's unbelievable out here.  Had that spring smell, didn't it, when you went outside?  Oh, that's what I was smelling out there.  Oh yeah.  I thought I was smelling poo-fah.  No, it is great out.  Spring fever has hit, Anthony.  Beautiful. You can feel it in the air.  People driving around with their windows down, maybe.  Sun roof open. 
[03:30]
 Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  I'm thinking we should preview Whip-a-Mow Wednesday today.  A little preview of the Wow-age?  A little preview of Whip-a-Mow Wednesday.  It is a little early in the season.  It's early, but we have a lot of brand new listeners, Anthony.  They don't know what Whip-a-Mow Wednesday is all about.  It's like the preseason.  It's a preseason, kind of like the Yankees.  You know how they're messing up things down there in Florida.  I hope they feel a little better than preseason Yankees have been doing.  I love that, though, how the papers print that, too. 
[04:00]
 You know, the Yankees have been having a little bit of a time there preseason.  Oh, in five?  It's not about preseason.  It's not about winning, though.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  And people are like, uh-oh, is this spelling a bad year for the Yankees?  If I'm not mistaken, I think they did the same thing last year.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  They had a really crappy spring.  Don't have to worry about it.  Spring training.  We just all got to pray for Darrell.  Oh, he's getting pissed, man.  Yeah, I know.  Steinbrenner walked out of a preseason game?  Relax. 
[04:30]
 I think this is the year where he finally loses it.  He finally goes back to the George we remember from the 70s.  This year, George Steinbrenner will fire Joe Torrey.  Thank you.  Really?  Wow, bold statement from the Opster.  Thank you.  It's been way too long.  I don't want him to fire Joe Torrey.  I think he would be stupid to fire Joe Torrey, but I think this is the year.  This is the year that George goes back to being the mean bastard that we all know and love.  I'm going to cut him out of the Yankees like they cut Yacoulin out. 
[05:00]
 Hey!  I just had that feeling in my gut today, Anthony, that the old George is coming back this year.  Yeah?  You know, all of a sudden the Yankees start off a little slow.  I don't think he has it in him anymore.  He fires Torrey.  I don't think he has it in him anymore.  To fire anyone?  Well, not to fire anyone, just to be that ball buster that he used to be.  Yeah, we'll say it's preseason.  Relax, Jesus Christ.  Got to say hi to everyone.  I saw the Knick game last night at the Garden. 
[05:30]
 Did anybody comment on your faggy pink hat?  Well, that's why I have to say hi to everyone that came by and said hi and said,  wow, Anthony was right.  Your hat is not pink.  Thank you very much.  It's a red hat.  It's a red hat, yes.  But, man, it was the earliest I've ever left a professional basketball game,  and you know how much I love hoops.  Very boring.  I left late in the third quarter, Anthony.  Now, why?  To catch the 9.31 back home.  But what was the problem with the game?  Well, when you're at the Garden, you have to make some decisions. 
[06:00]
 It's like, hmm, should I make the 9.31 train home or should I wait until the 10.02?  Right.  And the game wasn't going anywhere.  They were up by 20 or so at that point.  I'm like, you know what?  This is boring.  Up by 20?  Up by 20?  Yeah.  So I guess they won because...  No, they kicked serious ass.  The team looked great.  Yeah.  But it was Vancouver, man.  Vancouver, it seemed like they were playing an exhibition game last night. 
[06:30]
 Yeah.  Like, Vancouver has got to be the most boring team in the NBA.  No standout stars.  It just sucked.  You could just feel it in the place.  Even though the Knicks were playing great and kicking their ass,  it was like there was no energy in the Garden last night.  Huh.  So I'm like, screw this.  I'm going home.  Wow.  So I took the early train home last night.  Were you sitting in the seats we usually sit in?  Yeah.  Those seats.  Oh, yeah.  Because I think we had the game on for a couple of minutes in the office  and I think we saw you. 
[07:00]
 Really?  Yeah.  I'm not a joke.  All right. Here's the joke.  No, I swear.  It wasn't a joke.  It was a hat.  It was a hat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because on TV it turned up a little pink.  Shut up.  I'm serious.  You're such a dick.  It's no joke.  What a douche.  At least I go to sporting events and stuff.  I went to the Knicks game with you last night.  And support the team and things like that.  Aw, support the team.  Like the Knicks care if you're there.  You know what I mean.  As long as big fat Star Jones is on the sideline and Spike, 
[07:30]
 that's all they care about.  The celebrities.  Star Jones was there.  Was she?  Spike was there.  No Tom Brokaw last night.  No Woody Allen.  She's one of those big fat Knick groupies.  She goes to every game.  Every game I've been to she's been there, yes.  Some people like that.  Like Star.  I'm convinced she just wants to be seen there.  I think that's part of it.  Another part of it is it's a reason for her to talk to men. 
[08:00]
 You know what I mean?  Like if she goes to the Knick game she could start a conversation.  Oh, how about the Knicks?  Oh, I was at the game last night.  Me big fat Star Jones was there.  I'm a lawyer.  But I think it just gives her something to talk about.  You know?  Like she's there at every game.  Right on the sideline.  Well, she's in the front row.  Court side.  You know those court side seats are just unbelievably expensive, Anthony.  This is a great game.  More chicken wing. 
[08:30]
 Oh, that was a good shot.  Right in my mouth.  I'm not talking about the game.  I'm talking about the guy throwing chicken wing at me.  You know, people work their whole lives to try to get really good seats.  When you're going for season tickets you know the deal, right?  Sure.  Very hard.  Can you imagine after years and years you finally get court side seats at the Garden  and you have to sit next to Star Jones?  Because the seats in the Garden to begin with are so freaking next to each other.  It's very tiny.  They kind of squeeze as many asses in there as possible. 
[09:00]
 Then you've got Star Jones' thigh on your leg as you're trying to sit down and watch the Knicks.  She's like moving all over trying to see the game.  I've got to see that game.  Where's the ball?  Let me look at the guy on this side of the court.  Meanwhile you've got the big flabby holiday ham arm like bashing in the face.  But I'm a diva so it's okay.  Take all that money for those seats.  That's tasty.  What is that?  Basketball?  I hate the basketball.  Look at that.  I can't even tell. 
[09:30]
 Can't even tell.  Pay all that money for those seats and you only get to use a corner of them?  Yeah.  Gee, thanks.  Star Jones' big giant hippo calf and thigh is right brushed up against your leg.  That's good.  That's a unique flavor.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's your arm.  I seem to have taken a bite out of your forearm.  I like having a little Chinese here at the game.  I just ate too many. 
[10:00]
 Sorry, Woody.  Woody couldn't be bothered.  He wasn't there last night.  Know who was there?  Who?  I spent half the game checking out one of my favorite actresses of all time.  Uh-oh.  And I didn't know she was either married or just hanging with...  With a dude.  With Kevin Kline.  Kevin Kline?  Let me see.  Phoebe Cates.  Are they married?  Yeah.  Huh.  Does she look good?  Huh.  Oh, yeah?  She was going through a phase.  She hasn't aged a bit, Anthony.  She's sitting there with Kevin Kline and I'm staring at her the whole damn time. 
[10:30]
 Really?  Huh.  Where was she sitting?  You know where Brokaw sits?  Yeah.  Kind of like...  Why couldn't I be there to see Phoebe Cates?  You know, I spanked out a batch just like Judge Reinhold did and past times when Judge  ran high.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  I love that one.  Phoebe Cates.  Phoebe Cates, yeah.  Remember that scene where Phoebe comes out of the swimming pool?  I always...  Wait, tell me about that scene. 
[11:00]
 Let me get the music for you so we can take you right back, okay?  I'd like to make believe it's me.  All right, here we go.  Spanking out a batch in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  Here she comes.  Yeah.  Oh.  There it is, though.  She dives in the pool, swims up to the wall.  Now she climbs out of the pool slowly, misting water behind her as she unbuckles her brazier 
[11:30]
 and opening up between those lovely, eerie gaits and moves and says,  Tom, you know I've always wanted you.  Doesn't anybody freaking knock anymore?  Those guys are fags.  And then we're going to wig on over to Luzon and jam with the Stones. 
[12:00]
 Awesome.  Totally awesome.  But isn't this our time, Mr. Han?  Righteous Bucks.  Hey, a nice jacket. 
[12:30]
 I love those, dude.  When it comes to making out, always remember,  you're not going to get a good look at your face.  You're going to get a good look at your face.  You're going to get a good look at your face.  You're going to get a good look at your face.  When it comes to making out, always remember,  side one of a low-ceiling floor.  That's a very good job. 
[13:00]
 I'm a big fan of Passide the Ridgeman High.  That was great.  I can fix it.  I've got an awesome set of tools.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Now I'm banging Jennifer Jason Lee in the pool cabana.  Look at those saggy boobs.  What's up with her?  She's naked in every movie.  She was naked in every movie.  You're right, John.  Looking very bad in every movie naked. 
[13:30]
 But CBK is coming out of the pool.  We all remember that scene.  I remember leaving a little bash on the bottom of the NBC News  desk after I saw the screen.  I felt a little woozy, a little lightheaded,  in Big Tom's head and Little Tom.  Hey!  Tom, big Fast Times fan.  Oh, wow.  Phoebe, wow.  And she looks, come on.  Phoebe looked so freaking hot last night. 
[14:00]
 Just as good.  I was dying.  I can't accept that.  I was dying.  I was making believe there was a fly hitting the side of my face  so I could turn my head real fast and do the look.  Because you can't check out chicks when you're with your chick.  Yeah.  That always stinks.  So you've got to make excuses while you're looking elsewhere  instead of checking out Patrick Ewing down low in the paint.  I thought you could use some help with your math homework  on such a hot day.  Hey, Rat, would you get that out of the hamper? 
[14:30]
 You forgot the cheap trick.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You forgot the cheap trick.  Mommy's all right.  Daddy's all right.  It just seemed a little weird.  The dream police.  Da da da da da da.  Yeah, but Phoebe was hanging with Kevin Kline.  Yeah, well, they've been married for a while.  I did not know that. 
[15:00]
 I assumed Kevin Kline was gay.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Blow that assumption.  They've been married long enough where it isn't really a beard.  I thought he was into Tom Selleck.  Well, they did kiss in that movie.  Oh, boy, did they.  Jesus.  I don't know.  There was a mouth kiss on an SNL I saw the other day.  I saw that.  Did you see that one?  That was pretty funny.  That was a funny bit.  Yeah.  On the airplane, spanking each other.  All right, let's see. 
[15:30]
 A couple of guys kissed.  A couple of cast members.  Well, it was Will Farrell.  Yeah.  Chris Cattain, right?  I might have enjoyed it.  Right.  And then I was watching some of the old SNLs on Comedy Central.  And it's so funny to see J. Moore popping up on those things because I swear they gave  him the smallest parts ever.  He did nothing.  I mean, you thought Brewer barely showed up on those shows.  J. Moore is on screen long enough to just go, J, what's with the effing hair?  There's some wings going or something. 
[16:00]
 It was pretty funny.  He was one of the guys on the buh-bye sketch.  Buh-bye, buh-bye.  And they just usher him out of the plane.  You know, buh-bye.  You've got to remember all this next time J. Moore calls in.  Yeah.  We've got to abuse him.  Hound him a little bit.  Well, we're going to talk about Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, but we went off on some classic  O&A tangents there.  Always off on a tear.  Yeah, we want to preview Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today.  So we're encouraging the ladies of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, ladies.  To flash your fellow commuters. 
[16:30]
 Your fellow commuters on the way home today.  It's just a preview, Anthony.  Yeah, the nice weather.  It's a good way to get it started.  By the time April hits, this thing is going to be huge.  Huge.  We're going to have brand new stickers and all that, but I mean, this is a great opportunity.  It's too nice out today not to do something about it.  So ladies, we do encourage you to flash your commuters today, okay?  Absolutely.  On the way home.  And guys, if you see anything out there, please let us know, okay?  Right. 
[17:00]
 We'll go to the phones next.  212-757-1027.  Hello?  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  All right, Anthony, Mountain Dew.  Yes, Mountain Dew.  Mountain Dew, yes, Anthony.  I love Mountain Dew.  Oh yeah.  Remember drinking it when I was a kid?  I drink it now.  Good thirst quencher. 
[17:30]
 We got a hell of a deal working with Mountain Dew, don't we, Opie?  Uh-huh.  Why don't you tell them about it?  Oh, I thought you were going to tell them about it today.  No, this is basketball.  This is your thing.  The only thing I have to say is go Iona.  That's right.  Anthony picking Iona to go all the way in the NCAA tournament.  I'm betting on the retard factor.  Now we got a great deal.  A great deal.  A great thing going with Mountain Dew, the NCAA, and the Opie and Anthony show, of course.  Yes.  We are going to send one of our fine, fine listeners to the Final Four to check it out for yourself. 
[18:00]
 Nice.  This is what's going to happen, okay?  We're going to have all the teams, all 64 teams on the WNAW website, obviously looking for the college basketball fans out there, okay?  You go to the WNAW website when all the teams are announced, which is going to be what, Monday, I think?  Yep.  I think Monday we'll start that, okay?  And then you have to decide, Anthony.  Yes.  Who's going to be in the Final Four?  And then we are going to pick a winner.  Now what happens if like 20 people guess, you know, the Final Four teams? 
[18:30]
 Winners will be picked by random drawing.  Thank you, Anthony.  I'm sure.  That's usually the way it's worked if you have people that have picked the same teams.  All right.  So if you want to go to the Final Four, on us, and Mountain Dew, starting Monday, go to www.wnaw.com.  You'll see where to go.  And you pick the Final Four teams.  You'll register.  And then we'll pick a winner.  And it might be you, okay?  We now.  All right.  So do the Dew with Mountain Dew and listen to us to win a trip to the Final Four.  Mountain Dew.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[19:00]
 It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1027 WNEW.  Who'd that be?  That's lovely.  Who'd that be?  That's all we get to that.  It wasn't chewed up.  And we love Godsmack.  Come on.  Give it to me.  There we go. 
[19:30]
 Godsmack Moon, baby.  One of my favorite albums of the past couple of years at this point, Anthony.  What's your favorite album of the last couple of years, Anthony?  Last couple of years?  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Because I mean, you could easily say Kid Rock for the last year, possibly.  But if you go back a few years, which one of your favorite albums?  I have to say your favorite album of the last few years.  That's a tough question.  Maybe Rob Zombie's solo effort, Anthony.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Dracula.  Huh?  Which one? 
[20:00]
 No Doubt.  Yeah, the No Doubt album, Opie.  Yeah?  That's moving up the Anthony chart.  No.  The Anthony rock chart?  No, I would say I really liked the Rob Zombie.  Yeah.  That was a really good album.  Yeah.  I'd have to really think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it. 
[20:30]
 I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it. 
[21:00]
 I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  I think about it.  Because I mean we've tried.  It upsets them over there.  It upsets K-Rock because if we take their rock acts then what else have they got over there?  Not much.  You know the tide has completely changed with VH1 and MTV.  Like VH1 is becoming cooler. 
[21:30]
 You know when you used to, yeah, like years ago.  I hate to admit that but the videos I want to see are on VH1.  Years ago you used to say, God, if I start watching VH1 and thinking it's better than MTV, it's going to mean I'm getting old.  And that's not quite the truth anymore.  It just means that MTV is really blowing.  You know, what do you want us to do?  Listen to Britney and Instinct.  Or you know what I saw last night on VH1?  Henry Rollins. 
[22:00]
 Rollins band.  On VH1 I was dying.  Doing what? Liar?  No, like one of the new songs.  New album.  Really?  Yeah.  It kicked ass.  Henry Rollins' Liar is such a great thing.  I know.  It was good.  I was in his brain pop when he sung that song.  Liar!  I started laughing as I'm watching it because I'm just thinking of the Beavis and Budhead episode.  Who do you think would win in a fight?  Danzig or Henry Rollins?  I'd have to give it to Danzig. 
[22:30]
 You know, and they have this total argument going on.  You know, Rollins is pretty big there.  You're a dumbass.  I'd miss Beavis and Budhead.  Yeah.  So Henry Rollins is on VH1 and you switch over to MTV and you have 98 degrees.  Holy mother of pearl, what the hell is going on?  They're catering to the teeny boppers.  Or another Britney Spears look-alike. 
[23:00]
 Yeah.  Know how many Britney Spears look-alikes there are now?  Christina Aguilera.  Then they've got, I don't even know all the names of them.  Jennifer Simpson I think is one of them.  And Mandy something I think.  Yeah, they're all pumping them out like the boy bands.  You know, there's a bunch of carbon copies of those.  No one will ever beat Britney and her breast implants though.  The breast is always the best.  All the other ones need the breast implants.  Yeah, unless somebody's willing to get breast implants at like 12  and start singing to really get the publicity going.  Now that would be interesting. 
[23:30]
 That would be very interesting.  But yeah, now they're running off carbon copies.  And then you got Carson who I know has to hate the image that he is getting.  You see him on TV Guide and all these magazines.  And it's like, oh, all the girls love Carson.  He's just, oh, he's great.  He's like a teeny bopper idol.  They love him.  And you know, he wants credibility.  He wants music credibility.  And it's killing him. 
[24:00]
 It's killing him.  Well, because he used to do a cool radio show out there in LA.  Now he's the teeny bopper guy who is getting lumped in with instinct  and 98 degrees from all the girls that love all that.  They're putting his pictures up on the walls.  It's got to kill him.  The backdoor boys.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the last thing I think he wants.  He's the Dick Clark of our era.  Ah, good.  He is though.  You know something?  You just got to open up the MTV yearbooks. 
[24:30]
 Take a look back and please don't be too full of yourself.  There's plenty.  Remember J.J. Jackson?  J.J.  I liked Alan Hunter.  Martha Quinn.  Alan Hunter.  Alan Hunter is my favorite.  What?  Jay Moore was a VJ?  Jay Moore was a VJ?  I don't know.  Another question to ask him when he calls us again.  He might have had VD at some point.  I don't know if he was ever a VJ.  Hey, Sam, what's going on?  Oh, I just got to let you guys know you guys rock, okay? 
[25:00]
 Why?  I just had an awesome incident.  I work in the military.  Yeah.  I just came back from Fort Mama.  Yeah.  On the 18th on the way back, we're thinking, yeah, why not?  Just write something on a piece of paper.  Wow, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure enough, these two girls ride past us.  We didn't think nothing of it.  We just decided to give it a shot.  My friend whips out this wild side, sticks it on the window.  The girl starts laughing.  Sure enough, I've seen a lot and this one will be one of the most memorable.  I'm going to give it a shot.  I'm going to give it a shot.  I'm going to give it a shot.  All right, well, thank you.  All right, man.  They're very happy.  We are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today because we can't help it.  The weather is way too good out there.  So, ladies, we're encouraging you to flash the lights.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it. 
[25:30]
 We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  We're encouraging you to do it.  They're very happy, Anthony.  We are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today because we can't help it.  The weather is way too good out there.  So, ladies, we're encouraging you to flash your fellow commuters today.  Please, just to give our new listeners a sample of what they can expect all summer long here  on the Opie and Anthony Show, right, Anthony?  Right. 
[26:00]
 Basically, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, you put wow in your car and then the ladies know that  you want to see something.  Wow, somewhere on the car.  It could be written on the dirt and the big doors of your tractor trailer.  It could be on the back window of your car.  Yeah.  A little bumper sticker thing or something just written.  Bag of wow chips has been working great for the guys that have the wives or girlfriends  that don't want them putting wow in the car.  You get those wow chips and shove it in the, like, by the rear window, all of a sudden  you got a wow in your car.  Your wife is like, piss that eagle. 
[26:30]
 Oh, I forgot the bag of chips back there.  And we're only going to preview because we know winter is going to kick us in the ass  one last time.  It always does every year.  for good, probably in early April, I'm assuming.  Very good.  Right?  Yes.  But today we are encouraging the ladies.  We're going to push it today.  We're going to push it.  Yeah.  Ladies, flash your fellow commuters if you feel like it.  Wow-age.  Give them a taste of what, you know, the Opie and Anthony show is all about, all right?  Taste, a taste.  All right, we got to take a break, Anthony. 
[27:00]
 Wowed on train, wowed on the parkway.  Wow.  A lot of people checking in already, Anthony.  It's happening.  Nice.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes, it works.  It does work, Anthony.  And you might need it.  What have you been doing? 
[27:30]
 You've been eating.  You've been hibernating for the winter.  Well, simply.  Like a squirrel, you've been storing your nuts.  Now that we're getting a sample of spring today, Anthony.  You know, it's in the back of your head.  Oh my God, I got to lose some of this weight before the warm weather hits for good.  What happened?  I didn't have a bunt when I put my coat on.  Now all of a sudden you got to burn that bunt.  Burn that bunt.  How are you going to do it?  With the world's strongest bunt burner.  Yeah, we want to talk to the girl that heard about Stacker II from our show and lost over 
[28:00]
 100 pounds.  Is she too scared to contact us?  Come on.  There's a pre-recorded commercial that's running when we're not on the air where this  girl brags about how she lost 106 pounds on Stacker II.  She heard about it on our show.  Yeah.  And she basically wants to give us hummers.  Really?  Yeah, she's so ecstatic.  We changed her life, Anthony, with this stuff.  You know what's amazing?  The station itself, NEW, took a Stacker and lost about 300 pounds of fat. 
[28:30]
 300?  Try a couple tons.  It was called Tom Likens.  It's not 300.  Oh, come on.  It's about 180.  Really?  185.  He carries it like three.  Maybe it's the Mongoloid here to...  All right, Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner, does the three things.  It burns the fat.  It crushes the cravings in between meals.  And it gives you a boost of energy when you're petering out late in the day, okay?  Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner, give them a call.  1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner, 3-100-L-I-N-E. 
[29:00]
 Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner, thousands have proven it works.  As long as money is a sinking school bus, I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me bloat so much.  Great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and my two new favorite horns.  You guys are really horrible.  Oh, P.E. and Anthony.  What a couple of ass wipes.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Couple of ass wipes.  There you go.  Okay, terrific.  That's us.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, Pat, what's going on today?  Hey, how you doing?  Real good. 
[29:30]
 Is this Pat?  Huh?  Who is this, Pat?  Opie and Anthony, we're live on the air.  Let's go.  Hey, are you getting a little play by?  You're exit 13.  Okay.  I'm a truck driver.  I listen to you guys all the time.  I just got wowed by a couple chicks in a red car.  There you go.  Hey, whip them out Wednesday.  You guys are great.

[30:00]
 We're previewing whip them out Wednesday because we can't help you.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Definitely encouraging the ladies to flash their fellow commuters on the way home today  as we give you a preview of what the spring and summer is going to be like on the Opie  and Anthony show.  It's one of the many things, okay?  You want to talk about Clinton real fast?  This is great.  I guess we could start doing new material.  I've been on an hour and a half at some point.  Oh my God.  All right, I'll read this one.  Clinton finds screensaver amazing. 
[30:30]
 I love this.  This is the leader of the free world, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  President Clinton, who likes to play up his fascination with computers while playing down  his experience, was dazzled on Tuesday by a basic display of software, a screensaver.  A screensaver.  He was amazed by a screensaver, ladies and gentlemen.  There's a quote in here by Clinton saying, 
[31:00]
 Amazing.  Amazing.  Clinton said, I was watching a series of coffee cups, deer, and a blackboard form and dissolve  on a monitor during a visit to a computing class in a senior citizen center.  Wow.  Amazing.  Look at that.  Look, it's like pipes and they're just making themselves go.  I don't know where they're going.  Then they disappear.  Amazing.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  By a screensaver. 
[31:30]
 Yeah.  This just goes to show you that these jerk-offs have the speech writers and everything, and  they're publicity people, and they make their speeches about the internet.  He's been talking internet and everything, like he knows what he's talking about, computers.  God doesn't have a clue.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  A screensaver.  Amazing.  Not by The Sims or some of the great computer games out there.  No, nothing.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  Right.  Oh my God.  The low-key visit with about 30 participants in the class also got Clinton talking about 
[32:00]
 computer games he used to play with his daughter Chelsea.  They were Freddy's Rescue Roundup and the Carmen Sandiego series of educational games,  Anthony.  Just no porno.  I punch up the pornography like seagulls and stuff.  I like that.  That Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?  I played that one with Chelsea.  Hillary played Where in the World is Bill's Penis? 
[32:30]
 She wasn't really doing very well at that game right up until about a year ago.  Then she won.  I love.  I'm playing some new games.  Womb Raider.  Womb Raider.  A Gash Life.  New First Person Load Shooter.  It also says Clinton does not use his office email that much, Anthony.  What would he be doing? 
[33:00]
 I'm 15.  How old are you?  Clinton in the chat rooms.  That could be pretty funny.  Good AOL's chubby chick chat room.  I like this one.  Do you like seagulls?  How much do you waste?  Would you like to intern for me, the president?  That is ridiculous.  Clinton finds screensaver.  Amazing.  It's like magic.  I turn the monitor around and I don't see how they get those pictures in there. 
[33:30]
 I'm amazed by the whole thing.  There's a picture of fire on the monitor but I don't feel any warmth.  How they do that.  Amazing.  Yeah, suck it.  Go ahead.  I'm amazed by the screen.  Suck it.  Oh boy.  You find these things out toward the end of any administration.  The guy at the helm is a stark raving lunatic.  They've run out of things to talk about, Anthony, at this point. 
[34:00]
 So now they've got to dig deep.  Maybe he wasn't really paying attention to the computer on the monitor when Monica's ass was up there.  You know?  I didn't really look at the screen saver when I was looking at a big brown eye.  That's amazing.  Amazing.  Look at that big old brown eye.  That's amazing all right, Mr. Clinton.  My God.  I was wondering what that was.  A computer? Is that what it is?  What does it do? 
[34:30]
 What does that even do?  Suck it.  I got the brown eye screen saver.  It's amazing.  Opens and closes.  It's great.  Amazed by a screen saver.  Holy God.  You almost cursed there.  Oh my God. I'm amazed that he's amazed.  Even Gregor would probably say,  Yes, I know about screen savers.  They don't amaze me.  They amaze Clinton.  Mr. 20th century, 21st century. 
[35:00]
 Didn't Gore invent the Internet?  That's what he should know about...  That's what he claims, yes, Anthony.  I want to know something.  Did Clinton and Gore speak at all  during eight years together as President and Vice President?  Have you ever seen them in the same room?  Shaking hands? Talking?  These guys didn't say a word while not booing each other.  Eight years.  I didn't even think they knew each other.  And Al Gore invented the Internet.  Al Gore is my Vice President.  I'm amazed. 
[35:30]
 I didn't even know what is a Vice President.  Who are they kidding?  They're keeping Clinton as far away from Gore as possible.  Well, Gore is trying to become President.  And to have Clinton in there is...  Those ads are coming, though, Anthony.  Now that we know it's going to be Bush and Gore,  let's face facts here.  Bradley, what, he's dropping out tomorrow in Fiji?  He's going to endorse Gore.  And Bush, obviously, just pretty much killing McCain at this point. 
[36:00]
 McCain had a little rally there for a little while.  It was kind of cute.  Oh, look at the vet.  He's there, you know, we'll all get behind him and everything.  But then it fell apart.  He just doesn't have the support.  I think it all comes down to cash, too.  And looks.  Which is an awful thing because the best guy for the job might not be the most attractive guy.  The best guy for the job is Bradley, but he looks like a slob, in my opinion.  Bush looks like a President.  He looks like what people expect their President to look like. 
[36:30]
 You could picture him as President.  He looks like his dad, younger version of his dad.  Very good.  Get in the office.  Hey, son, can I maybe come in and sit in my old seat?  Maybe put my finger back on the button?  If Bush becomes President, does he sleep in the same bed his parents were stooping in?  The White House?  Oh, my God.  You know, 1-800-TRIABET.  Yeah, you know he's going to want to redo that room when he gets in there.  Yeah, Rockaway bedding.  He's going to need Rockaway bedding.  You don't want the old stained Bush mattress laying out on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
[37:00]
 Two big dents where Barbara Bush's fat ass is embedded in the bed.  You don't want that.  That's got to suck, though.  You become President, let's just assume, and then you see the room where your parents were having sex, and that's your room.  That's now your room.  That's now your room.  Yeah, clown your own face.  You know what the thing is, though, who really knows if that bed is still even in there? 
[37:30]
 I'm sure the Clintons have been through it, a mattress is good, but I've got to tell you, if I was George W. Bush,  who I would think would probably be the next President, just saying, he gets into office.  The first thing I do, day one after the inauguration, you move into the White House,  I would get the most stained, disgusting decrepit mattress and just carry it out to the curb and leave it out there.  And just like big stacks of porno mags and just pile it up by the driveway for the garbage man. 
[38:00]
 Would that be hysterical?  A couple boxes of cigars.  Cigars.  Old condoms and stuff.  Just like lay all that crap right on the curb.  God damn, would that be killer.  We should do that.  Yeah.  That's our bit, man.  Let's do that Clinton moving day giveaway.  Yes.  A stained mattress.  Oh, man.  A Clinton garage.  Take it away.  I have no need for this anymore.  Let's do a Clinton garage sale.  Clinton garage sale.  We'll broadcast live in front of the White House.  There's a park right in front of the White House there. 
[38:30]
 Yeah.  We'll broadcast from the park.  We'll do that.  Clinton's moving out.  And the savings are passed on to you.  This old stained mattress.  Some cigars.  Sploot stained dresses.  Very good.  Amanda, what's going on?  Hey guys, how's everything?  Good.  I was watching MSNBC last night waiting for the results to come in for the primaries.  Can I stop you there?  Sure.  Why did you have to tune in yesterday and wait for the results? 
[39:00]
 Why?  I have to know now.  No, I knew before Super Tuesday that it was all over.  I was a McCain supporter and I just wanted to see how it would be pulled out.  You were?  Yeah.  Why were you backing him?  I was backing him because he was like different, refreshing for the Republican party.  Like his shoulders.  Well, anyway, they had strategically placed Maria's driver in the hallway waiting for  McCain to come in to make his acceptance speech.  Oh yeah, this is great.  And he said, he snapped her, he said, get out of here. 
[39:30]
 And she got all bent out of shape.  But how else is this man supposed to act?  He's just like...  You know how he's supposed to act?  He's supposed to act not like a sore loser and presidential, or at least presidential  contender-ish.  Because he walked by her and she was asking him, you know, how do you feel?  How do you feel?  You know, prodding him and hounding him like reporters do.  And he turned around and said something like, get away from me.  Get off!  Get away from me!  I think it was very normal though.  It was very normal. 
[40:00]
 Get away!  You whore!  He's got it in him to snap Amanda.  That's why we wanted him to be president so he would snap in the Oval Office there.  Well, he had a little bit of a preview last night.  It was really funny because then whoever it was, if Brian, whoever the heck his name is on MSNBC,  he's like, well, you heard it here, get out of here.  It was so ridiculous.  Get out of here.  It was pretty funny.  All right, guys, take care.  Who are you going for now that McCain's pretty much out of it? 
[40:30]
 You're going to...  All right, well...  She'd probably go for Bush.  That's what I would assume.  Darren, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how are you doing?  How are you?  How amazed is Bill Clinton about DNA?  DNA.  I can't believe they found me.  I'm amazed.  How did they find out that was my splooge?  I'm amazed.  Well, there you have it.  The president amazed at a screen saver.  That's something.  You know something? 
[41:00]
 I got to admit, I was pretty amazed when I went from like my Commodore 64 or my Atari 800  with my cassette load drive.  Sure.  You just have games on cassette tapes.  I remember that.  And it was a cassette load.  You just have to type in C load, for cassette load.  So when the computers really...  I got my first Mac, and you see the screen saver on it, and the graphics are so sharp,  and it's pretty cool, it's moving, doesn't look like that pixelated crap you used to 
[41:30]
 get on Atari and Commodore.  I've got to say, I was amazed.  I was amazed.  Well, that's something to be amazed about.  It was also 1983.  I know, right?  I don't get to be amazed.  But it's the year 2000.  I get to be amazed at a screen saver.  I'm amazed.  You know what else?  Get this.  You should have a screen saver of Monica giving them a hummer or something.  I took this TV dinner.  I put it in this thing that I like to call the cooking box in the White House. 
[42:00]
 Pushed a button or two, made these amazing beeping noises.  And you know something?  In three minutes, that came out hot.  They called that a microwave oven.  Amazing.  Normally it would take maybe 20 minutes to thaw and cook that Swanson TV dinner.  Three minutes, I was amazed.  I ate the whole thing in front of my screen saver.  Are you amazed at beepers too?  What the hell is that? 
[42:30]
 You don't know what a beeper is?  No, explain.  You can have your girlfriend beep you?  Whoa.  You mean the little thing that Beechlinch is calling it?  Yeah.  I am amazed.  God damn, there he is, the president that was talking about leading us into the 21st century.  Amazed by the screen saver.  Not amazed by MP3 files or... 
[43:00]
 No.  Or Voodoo graphics cards.  A big lighter.  And you move your thumb and there's fire.  No more banging rocks.  I am amazed.  Let's take a break, huh?  Amazing.  Having lots of fun today.  Let's not forget, we are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today.  Ladies, we're encouraging you to flash your fellow commuters on the way home today to give them a little taste of what's going to happen in the spring and summer, okay? 
[43:30]
 All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there. 
[44:00]
 You're such a woman.  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah.  That's pretty gay, man.

It's the only area, uh, mattress store that offers you a free steel bed frame, free delivery, and complete removal of your old betting.

I do now understand it's time to save the screens with these amazing screensavers.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pat.  All right.  All right.  Communication now.  We're trying.  We'll get there.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete?  Hello? 
[51:00]
 What's up, Pete?  Yo.  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you?  Good, good.  Hey, I don't know if you ever checked this out, and I don't know if I'm allowed to see  this on the air.  There's a little video game, and it's called, it was at www.comeonmonica.com.  Oh, yeah.  Have you checked that out?  Yeah, we've seen that.  You have like a Johnson, a penis.  I guess you could say a penis.  OK, yeah.  And Monica's in the background going side to side, and you want to like hit her.  Right, right. 
[51:30]
 And it's like you see the hand on the Johnson, and it's like you're cocking a gun.  Wow, but yes, it's a very funny little game on the Internet.  He could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he had just played that, and that would  have been just as amazing.  Well, guess who they modeled that penis after.  It's the game.  Come on.  Yeah, save the screens now.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  That is a very funny little Internet game to check out. 
[52:00]
 Hours are fun.  Hours are fun.  Maybe play for what?  I don't know, two minutes.  Yeah, all right.  What else can I find online?  Yeah, right.  Where's the porn?  Hey, Belinda, what's going on?  Hey, who is this, O or is this A?  Both.  It's O and A.  Oh, hey, guys.  How are you?  I'm very depressed right now because nobody's noticing me.  Why?  What do you mean?  Well, I'm sitting here in a pretty busy shopping center right outside of like a McDonald's.  I listen to you guys all the time, and it was really going to be nice today, so I purposely 
[52:30]
 didn't even wear a bra.  I purposely wore this shirt that kind of has like a bra built into it.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting here lifting up my shirt and nobody's even noticing me.  Wow, how ugly are you?  I don't think I'm that ugly.  They're not noticing?  How big are your boobs?  Like 36 days.  All right, you have 36 days.  You're in a shopping center.  You've been flashing and people aren't noticing?  No.  There seems to be a problem.  Well, not with me. 
[53:00]
 Do you smell?  Do you have tinted windows?  My name is not that girl Karen who has no problem.  Oh my goodness.  Who's coming in later this week to get sponged down.  I know.  Do you have cranky ass?  Excuse me?  Cranky ass?  Cranky ass.  I have happy ass.  Happy ass.  You don't want cranky ass.  I have like a bubble butt, like a Jennifer Lopez butt.  Oh, big ass.  No, it's nice.  It's very firm because I squat.  You squat.  I like girls that squat. 
[53:30]
 As Cowbell Bill says, if you pop the nugget and then go for a long walk, you'll get cranky  ass.  My ass is happy.  You know, it's like you had to really force out that last milk dud and then you take a  long walk, you're going to get cranky ass.  Where is Cowbell Bill?  How deal.  How deal.  He comes up with the best stuff.  Why did she hang up?  We were going to give her some advice.  Maybe that's what she had.  Oh my God, I have cranky butt. 
[54:00]
 You think she has that cranky ass?  Cranky ass.  Well, she's got to call back.  We were going to have her wow live on the show.  We'll get people to notice her.  Sometimes you don't know that little milk dud is still dangling.  And you get up.  Anything over about a quarter mile and you got cranky ass.  How deal.  He comes up with the best stuff, man.  He's insane.  He's in Florida.  He's still in Florida?  He's down there for like a month golfing. 
[54:30]
 I don't know what the hell this guy does.  Nice life.  He just makes jokes all day.  JB, what's going on?  I just got wowed.  Hey, congratulations.  Bravo.  Leaving the golf course, chick wowed me.  Oh, I believe you said leaving the golf course, a chick wowed you.  Honest to God's truth, we're in the parking lot.  Where were you?  Hillsboro, New Jersey.  All right, there you go.  Nice.  And they look like Mae Young. 
[55:00]
 Bad news.  I'm hated for life, guys.  Even a bad set's a good set, JB.  That's right.  I was in vacation months ago.  All right, thank you, JB.  Later.  Bye.  Previewing Whip-A-Mill Wednesday today for our fine listeners, Anthony.  Sure.  Cranky ass.  Cranky ass.  You don't want cranky ass.  Kind of make sure you clean up.  Get every little nugget out. 
[55:30]
 Another mess of a show in progress.  What else did you expect today?  Oh, please.  Hey, we talked politics a little bit today, right?  Sure we did.  A little bit.  We talked about the Knicks and the Yankees a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit there.  We don't go right to the gutter, but we always end up there.  We always end up there is right.  Oh, brother.  All right, I think we have to take another break.  What is it?  You want me to go to one of these?  A lot of few calls coming in about Dice.  I don't know what that's all about. 
[56:00]
 Well, we'll get into that next.  I was wondering, because did he have a pay-per-view?  Dice on pay-per-view last night?  Was that a brand new one?  Why wouldn't he call and like come on the show so we could promote his pay-per-view?  Does he think he's so big that he can still sell out huge pay-per-views without maybe a friend or two maybe talking about it?  Maybe he doesn't like us anymore already.  What did we do?  Listen to us and you figure it out.  Come on.  All right, we'll maybe talk to Dice next. 
[56:30]
 Then more of your phone calls.  212-757-1027.  What is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it's easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be troublesome.  We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  127-WNEW.  Oh, groovy. 
[57:00]
 Little retro.  Lots of instant feedback coming in, Anthony.  Luke from Jersey writes,  Okay, terrific.  Almost got me fired today.  Thank God the boss is a fan.  Kept playing it over the intercom.  And he came in and said,  Okay, terrific.  Do it again, you're fired, ass.  Okay, terrific.  Sweeping the tri-state area. 
[57:30]
 Oh, yeah.  Oh, love it.  But you got to know when to use the okay, terrific.  You can't just use it.  No.  Right, Anthony?  Well, the best place, I guess, is the same place,  like, Butt-Head used to just make that face,  where he would stare into the screen and not say anything.  But his face was like...  His mouth open.  Like what?  Horrified.  Yeah.  I'll give you one.  What?  Hey, Anthony, I got cranky ass today. 
[58:00]
 Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Well, it works, right?  That one worked, right?  And you try one.  Let's see.  Hey, ever have your girl put on a strap on a do-ya?  Okay, terrific.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Okay, terrific. 
[58:30]
 Ha!  Ha!  Yes.  All right, let's go to Jimmy.  See what this pay-per-view is all about.  Jimmy, what's up, man?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Not much.  Happened to be flipping through a channel last night,  and I saw his face on video.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  I'm not watching.  Who?  You're talking to Diceman.  Ha!  Yeah, I saw the Diceman.  I couldn't believe it.  It was like a train wreck, man.  A train wreck.  It was his pay-per-view from last year? 
[59:00]
 It was a pay-per-view.  I don't know.  It looked like it was from Vegas or something.  It looked like someone was shooting it with a camcorder.  It was so bad.  Oh, my God.  Really?  It was so bad.  Why would they play an old dice pay-per-view?  I don't know.  It looked recent because he was fatter.  You know, he looked out of shape and, like, you know, his face.  He looked older.  But I don't know.  At one point, this guy got so desperate  that he had to lay down on stage and start humping the stage or something  like some girl was taking in the balloon out of time.  Hey, that's funny stuff, Jacob Face. 
[59:30]
 Ha!  What's the matter?  You paid for it, didn't you?  Hey, I didn't pay for it.  Did you pay for it, Palmer?  I didn't pay for it.  I didn't pay for it.  Well, you got illegal box?  I got the scam-per-view.  Hey, could you send me five bucks if you enjoyed it?  Huh?  Oh, well.  I can't help you, man.  Well, we're trying to get him back on the show,  but we can't find him lately.  Well, listen, back in the day, I got, you know,  I got to give the guy his box.  Back in the day, he was funny.  You got to admit that. 
[60:00]
 The guy was probably the biggest thing that ever hit comedy.  And I think that would ruin them.  For how short a period of time.  Yeah, he skyrocketed.  I think that would ruin them, though.  And came down just as fast.  I'm still there.  I'm still there.  I sell out the garden.  The olive garden over here in Times Square.  Yeah.  Okay, Jimmy, thank you.  No problem any time.  Let's see what Charlie can answer this.  Charlie, you saw the dice pay-per-view, huh?  Yeah, I think Anthony should do dice,  because he does it better than dice does dice. 
[60:30]
 You just pay Anthony to go on pay-per-view.  Anthony doesn't do dice.  Dice is really here when you hear it.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, when you hear the dice voice.  What's wrong with you?  You're funny on your show.  You got a problem?  Yeah, you're funny.  You're on ONA, then you're on your pay-per-view show.  Hey, take your face.  Huh?  I'm still relevant.  It's all topical.  What's your little dog doing there, Dice?  I got some new stuff.  Yeah, tell me something new.  Hey, you see this, the McCain?  Yeah.  They're trying to be elected.  Yeah, yeah. 
[61:00]
 Yee-hee!  Wait a minute, that's all you got on McCain?  Well, he's goofy.  Did you see his shoulders?  Yeah, we see his shoulders.  They're all crunched up.  He goes, oh, I want to be president.  Ow!  See, I do political commentary.  It's topical.  You're doing topical stuff.  Sure.  Now, Hillary wants to be senator.  Yeah, senator of this fine state of our...  Ow!  What?  Whore?  Whore!  Fat whore!  See, I throw the fat in. 
[61:30]
 That's funny.  Come on, topical.  Ow!  You're cutting edge, Dice.  Cutting edge, farmer.  Anything on Bush or Gore?  Hey, Bush, he's got a name like a gish.  Ow!  See, it's topical.  Bush, yee-yee!  And what about Gore?  El Gore.  Yeah.  Ow!  Oh, that's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Oh, yeah.  Oh!  It's a stick figure!  And I was with this chick the other night. 
[62:00]
 She goes, oh, I think Gore's sexy.  I said, suck my yee-yee!  Oh!  I can't understand why you're not filling arenas with this topical, edgy stuff, Dice.  Wait, I can't do this show no more.  I'm dying over here.  No, I'm serious.  I gotta leave.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  Hey! 
[62:30]
 I'm dying over here.  Wait, Dice, someone wants to talk about your rhinestones during the TV show.  John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Hey, Dice.  Yeah?  That, uh, rhinestones on your jacket was screwing up my TV.  You had so many on there.  Yeah, I got my big Dazzler and I wrote Diceman rules.  A dice?  A dice.  And it sparkles!  I mean, you can't get it in your personal!  I mean, you can't get it in your personal!  A dice?  I'm dying over here! 
[63:00]
 Dice, have you seen the back of your jacket recently?  Well, last time I saw it, it says Dice rules.  Okay?  Turn your face!  Well, now it says Dice is a dork on the back of your jacket.  You better take it off and take a look.  Who's that?  Club Soda Kenny with a big Dazzler?  Bringing a funny man?  I'd love to stay, but look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  Look, I'm dying over here.  I mean, you can't get it in your personal! 
[63:30]
 Wait, you're hoping for more examples of your topical humor.  You got anything on a...  Yeah, but I'm dying over here!  You've been dying for a while, man.  Listen.  Topical humor?  Yeah, you got anything on...  All right, let me rip in the noose.  I'll give you something.  Give me a subject, I'll tell you.  I'm just as good as Seinfeld.  All right.  Who?  Top of my head here, Katie Couric and her little examination on the Today Show.  Oh, you see, she got the anal exam.  Yeah, the pipe, yes. 
[64:00]
 Hey!  You see her?  You get the pipe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, what's up with that?  Huh?  I'm dying over here.  Look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  Hey!  You see her ass?  Yes.  Yeah.  We all saw her.  I said, Katie, you know, what's with the ass on TV?  She goes, oh, Dice, deeg!  So I did her.  See, this is good stuff here. 
[64:30]
 This is going to get you right on top again.  You want to go through the paper and riff a little more there, Dice?  Look, I think I'm dying over here.  Yeah, I'll riff on the paper.  Okay.  You see the stock market yesterday?  Yeah, it plunged 374 points.  I had a chick, she plunged on me!  Hey!  See, that's topical.  I'm just riffing on the news.  Okay.  I write another story.  What do we got here?  Hey! 
[65:00]
 Would you like me to give you one, maybe?  Yeah, I can't read.  I just figured this out.  Hey, you know what I found out?  These screensavers are amazing!  I ain't never seen one!  All of a sudden the computer's making pictures!  I'm like, hey!  Well, people are calling in with reviews of your show last night, Dice.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's going on?  How's it going, O&A?  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing, Rob? 
[65:30]
 Whatever the hell your name is, Jacob?  All right, I checked out your pay-per-view last night.  Yeah, thank you.  Funny stuff, right?  Yeah, it sucked.  I mean...  Hey, what are you talking about?  It looked like you shot.  It looks like I've seen amateur porn that looks better than that.  Yeah, would you moderate it?  See, I came back out of there.  You like that?  Yeah, very good, Dice.  I was watching Ten Minute Minute and I turned on Friends.  It was friggin' terrible.  It was a piece of crap.  Dice, he turned you off for Friends.  Hey, you see that in Show Friends?  Yeah. 
[66:00]
 What's with that Chandler?  What kind of name is Chandler?  Oh!  That's all you got on one of the hottest shows of our time?  Hey, I don't feel too good.  Look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  I'm dying over here.  All right, listen, why don't you talk about Hillary's new hairdo?  Hey, you see Hillary's new hairdo?  That's a big story here in New York.  And she makes her Senate run.  A little makeover for Hillary.  So she had the hair on top of her head done.  You...  Oh! 
[66:30]
 Wait a minute, Dice.  You can't say that.  Hey, did you have to dump out?  Yeah, we had to dump out.  Hey, they're screaming on the phones.  Wow, let's see if they heard that on the phones.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I saw the Dice thing last night.  The guy sucked.  I think that, you know...  Like your mother sucks, Jack.  Hey, Jack, what's your last name?  Ass?  Jackass.  Look, I put two words together, and I make them look like a jackass. 
[67:00]
 Oh!  Hey, Dice, I think it said, kick me on the back of your jacket.  I think they got the beat, Dassler, and they put that, that, kick me, kick me in my fat ass.  Hey, let's see you do, let's see you do a pay-per-view, jackass, okay?  Let's see you.  Hey, Dice, can you say anything other than jackass?  Yeah.  Ass jack.  You're an ass jack.  See, I can turn it around.  Hey, hey, why are you hanging up on our listeners, Dice? 
[67:30]
 I don't want to talk to him.  Why?  Because he's a jackass.  Was he getting the best of you or something?  No one gets the best of the Diceman.  Let's go to Tim.  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  The Diceman Show was new on Friday night. It was on Friday.  A new one?  Yeah.  See, you were, hey, hey, shut up and let me talk.  So you were laughing, right?  Yeah, I was laughing.  You thought it was hysterical?  Yeah, second time around.  What was that supposed to mean, Jack? 
[68:00]
 What are you, Dice?  No, I'm cursing.  He said that's where it'll be.  You gotta be, you gotta be on the button.  Like the Diceman, I'm up today.  Look, Cotting Lee leaving the show.  Yeah.  You ever see her?  Uh.  With the can sagging.  Yeah, she doesn't wear a bra.  Oh!  That's all you got on that?  Well, she's the giga-miga-giga-giga-gigapunchalow. 
[68:30]
 And Regis, what is it?  The G-G-G-Millionaire Show.  Yeah, who wants to be a millionaire?  Who wants to be?  I got millions of dollars for when I sold out like the garden.  Yeah.  Oh!  Put me in the hot seat.  I'm dying over here.  Who wants to be a washed-up comic?  Is that the name of your new show?  Hey, Farmer.  Yeah.  Hey, how about Cardinal O'Connor?  How about him?  He's gonna be retiring soon. 
[69:00]
 Hey, he looks like a marshmallow with a big head.  What?  Come on, that's funny.  That's almost there, sure.  I surprised myself.  I'm laughing at that one.  A marshmallow with a big head.  All right, well.  Oh!  Marshmallow with a big head on me.  Hey, see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah.  He looks like a big melted marshmallow.  See, now I changed it up a bit.  I'm topical.  Hey!  You're riffing.  John has a short poem for you.  John?  Hey, O.P.  Hey there, Dice.  Hey.  Hey, John. 
[69:30]
 Okay?  Roses are red, violets are blue.  No one under 18 has ever heard of you.  Hey, can I use that?  Oh, sure.  I'm putting that in the egg.  All right, thank you, John.  Hey, John.  Say this.  I mean, you can't give me this drink up by the personnel.  I mean, you can't give me this drink up by the personnel.  I'm dying over here.  Hey, John.  John.  You see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah.  He looks like a marshmallow with a big head.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, John.  John.  John.  Hey, John.  You see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah.  He looks like a melted marshmallow with a pulp hat.  Uh, that's kind of funny.  I get up. 
[70:00]
 Wow, John.  Dice is working it here.  You can laugh at at least one of his jokes.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  Hey, you understand?  I'll give you half a heart.  TK from Long Island.  Dice, you get the pipe to see if there's any remnants of his career in there.  I'm still hot.  Look, they need a pay-per-view.  Yeah.  I think someone at pay-per-view screwed up and put the wrong reel on.  What was that, the outtakes?  Supposed to be Steel Magnolias or something. 
[70:30]
 This guy says you look like the Fonz on your pay-per-view.  Oh, man.  Hey, the Fonz is cool.  No, it looks like a 60-year-old Fonzie with a sequin jacket, the same old cigarette, stupid  thing.  It's over.  See, I do believe the thing when I come out on stage and I like the cigarette.  I'm telling you, you should take Fonzie's place.  Hey, sit on it, Ponsie, okay?  Sit on it.  Hey!  So you look like the Fonz now, huh?  That's what I'm going for, like a cross between the Fonz and Vinny Barberino with a cigarette. 
[71:00]
 Up your nose with a rubber hose.  Hey!  Cunning him in my office.  Oh!  See, I'm going for the Fonzie thing.  I still come out on the stage.  Yeah.  I look all cool.  Oh, yeah.  I light a cigarette.  Oh, sure.  And then I have a heart attack.  I have to go.  I'm going to get the personnel.  Can you say that?  Take off.  I'm going to get the personnel.  I'm dying.  Sean, what's going on?  How are you? 
[71:30]
 How are you?  Good.  That pay-per-view is going to be on again tomorrow night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, everyone should...  It's new.  It's called pay-per-view.  It stinks, okay?  If you don't get the personnel, you're going to be on the stage.  You're going to be on the stage.  You're going to be on the stage.  It stinks, okay?  If you don't get it with the rubber lizard.  Yeah, huh?  Take off.  Can I use that?  Hey, you see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah, you did the Cardinal O'Connor joke, man.  It's a new one.  It is?  Yeah.  Okay.  It looks like a pillow with a quill pad on.  It's topical.  Did you see HBO's If These Walls Could Talk?  Oh, they got to do with the dykes.  Yeah, you must have some good material on that. 
[72:00]
 Yeah, Alan DeGeneres, right?  Yeah, Alan DeGeneres, right?  Yeah, Alan DeGeneres, right?  Yeah, Alan DeGeneres, right?  Yeah, Alan DeGeneres, right?  Yeah, Alan DeGeneres, right?  She chose a rug.  Oh!  That's all you got.  Oh!  Sharon Stone.  Yeah.  With the, uh, she's got like cans.  Yeah, she does.  And Ellen was playing with them.  Yeah, she was.  Oh!  Oh my God.  I'm dying over here.  I know you are.  Make it happen to the personnel.  All right, we'll take one more call for your dice, okay?  Anthony, what's going on? 
[72:30]
 Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Dice.  Yeah.  You are done.  Hey, thank you.  You are so done.  Is that a new hip term the kids are using?  Done?  That means like you're hot, right?  Like fat?  When people say hit dice, you're fat.  That means good, right?  So I'm done.  What was that deal with those cards you wrote last night?  He had these cards.  Oh, it's the new act I got it. 
[73:00]
 Say, instead of rhymes, I'm doing greeting cards.  You couldn't even read it.  Yeah, let me do one.  You couldn't even read it.  I'm going to do one.  I'm going to do one.  This one would be for a chick for Valentine's Day.  It says, Happy Valentine's Day, you freaking whore.  See, that's funny, right?  Look, you're laughing.  He had nothing.  Here's another one, a personal Christmas card for Christmas.  Merry Christmas, you freaking whore.  See?  And then I got an authorization one on a birthday. 
[73:30]
 Happy birthday, you fat bitch.  Hey, yee.  See, this is funny.  It's a new twist on the rhymes.  Dice, we got the Olive Garden on the line.  They want to book you.  There's the Olive Garden on the line.  Yeah, Dice, how you doing?  What is this exactly the garden I'm looking for?  Yeah, this is Mike from the Olive Garden, Dice.  What's going on?  What can I do for you, Jacob?  I want to know if you can sell out a table of five.  Table of five? 
[74:00]
 I got some hospitality, I know.  I saw you the other day at the laughter you crapped your pants in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Yeah, and then I'm playing at Shake Your Balls Loose and the Ha Ha's and the Comedy Toilet.  Oh!  Ha Ha just left.  My career's rolling.  All right, Olive Garden, thank you.  And finally, Jack.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I think Dice, I have a great idea for Dice, you know, how it can improve his act.  I say you put a cigarette in your ass on stage. 
[74:30]
 All right, I'm still with him, don't laugh.  If this will get the career back, it means you're going to get your personnel.  Yeah, by the way, I figured out what that means, the executive cook of the personnel.  I think you're having a stroke.  You're a freaking fat loser.  I could be, look, I'm dying over here.  Smoke another cigarette, you fat loser.  You have a greeting card for this guy, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  I know it's your birthday and you want the cash, but not until you show me your gays. 
[75:00]
 All right, whore.  I got a greeting card for Dice.  Yeah.  My deepest sympathy on the loss of your pathetic career, you fat sow.  Hey, can I use that?  Jack.  The only original thing.  Hey, your name's Jack, Jack off.  Look, I got him, right?  I nailed you.  I nailed you and you know it.  Your name's Jack, I called you Jack off.  Look, oh, I got you.  I got a good one.  What are you, a chink?  Are you a chink?  Look, I'm racist now.  Hey, hey, chink.

 Hey, Jack.  Hey, those are the only people your acts is funny to.  They don't understand you.  Hey, Jack, Jack off.  Look, I'm still banging you.  Hey, hey, I got a new one for you, off Jack.  Hey, hey, that's good.  I like this guy.  You want to come to Vegas with me?  You can open up and make a tag and it gives you the personnel.  Hey, yeah, I'll take you.  I'm dying over here.  I'll take you to Vegas.  You can be my sideshow freak. 
[76:00]
 Hey, Jack off.  Jack.  Hi, Jack.  I'm going to use the cigarette in the ass.  No, I like that.  That's the only way you'd be entertaining you fat loser.  Hey, what are you hanging up on him for, Dice?  I don't want to talk to nobody that's going to be railing me.  Hey, I got some more cards.  All right.  Here's one for Mother's Day.  Hey, Mom, happy Mother's Day, you freaking whore.  Okay?  See, you're laughing.  It's just topical funny stuff. 
[76:30]

I can book you dice at a cemetery.  Those are the only people who ain't gonna walk out on your pathetic act,  you fat slob.  Oh!  Hey, shut up, bitch!  Another Jack. 
[79:30]
 Jack off.  Yeah, you gonna hang up on me?  You got nothing to say, you fat loser.  Hey, what's your last name, Jack?  Off?  Okay, I nailed you with my personnel.  Have another stroke on the air, you fat loser.  Hey, I think he's right.  I'm dying of being here.  All right, one more greeting card dice, one more.  All right?  Yeah.  This one's for lovers, okay?  Okay.  I know that in this world there's only two of us.  Now I'm gonna punch ya in the friggin' uterus.

This stuff is packing them in lately, huh?  I tasted the new dice on the O&A show. 
[80:30]
 Happy Chinese New Year, you friggin' slob.  Ho ho ho ho!  I don't think we need the racist stuff, Dice.  The dice always too racist.  Hey, how about you see my aunt when I go, Chinese, how could you give them keys to a car?  You could blindfold these people with dental force, okay?  Didn't we drop a couple of bombs on these people?  Wait, Dice, I thought you were trying to do the Seinfeld thing.  Not the racist thing.

 Andrew Dice Seinfeld.  Yeah, I thought you were doing a little Seinfeld.  What's with these airplanes?  What's with the peanuts?  Always with the peanuts, huh?  How about these airplanes with the peanuts?  Dice, do you have maybe a tender greeting card that you're working on?  Hey, creamer, suck my hog, okay?  Maybe a tender greeting card.  Tender moments?  Yeah.  Maybe a little softer.  So for like Valentine's Day?  Sure, maybe a Valentine's Day card. 
[81:30]
 You're so special, and you want to know what?  I...  All right.  Oh!  Well, thanks for stopping by, Dice.  I love you so, you're a whore.  I'm a good person now.  Okay.  What does it mean when it feels like an ice pick's going through your temple? 
[82:00]
 Because I think I'm dying over here.  I got this feeling, and my eyes are going back and forth.  But with that...  And my head like a whore.  That doesn't make any sense.  That doesn't, but...  Oh, it makes it easy to personal.  You want to take a break, Dice?  Farmer.  You want to take a break?  Yeah, you need a break from the comedy styling, don't you?  Boy, Dice, you can only take so much comedy in one sitting.  Whore!

[84:00]
 Nice little spring night happening today.  Yeah, I wonder if they're going to be putting the tables out yet.  Probably not yet.  Probably not yet, but man, when the warm weather does hit for good,  it's just a great atmosphere down there.  You got the tables on the sidewalk.  It's a great place to eat and people watch.  The staff of Pizano treats you right.  The food's great.  The price is reasonable.  Huge portions.  Huge portions.  And pretty much somebody associated with this radio show down there.  Almost, almost every night of the week.  Check out their wall of celebrities.  They have a bunch of pictures of all the celebrities. 
[84:30]
 And for some reason, we're up there too.  I don't understand that one.  Oh, yeah.  But yeah, you'll love Pizano.  We do.  Ask for Joey when you're down there, the owner,  and you get a glass of wine on the house.  Father Joey.  Father Joey.  What, is he a priest now?  Father Joey.  Father Joey.  He can be wearing the collar and everything.  He's got a daughter now.  Christine Nicole.  Hey, can I play down there?  What do you mean, Dice?  Guy, I need a gig.  You want to do a little 15-minute act while people are reading some linguine?

I like that.  11101027 WNEW. 
[86:00]
 What's this?  Another one bites the dust.  I still laugh at that commercial that uses,  another one bites the dust, with the guy driving the hearse.  Yeah.  He's making all those faces at the bars, you know why?  That's not what this is, is it?  It's not a commercial.  No.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Is this taken from songs from the glory holes? 
[86:30]
 What the hell is this?  Fax line, 212-957-9639.  And we are previewing Whip Them Out Wednesday today, Anthony.  Such a nice spring day, nice and warm.  Want to give the newer listeners a taste of what they can expect  when Whip Them Out Wednesday hits sometime in April.  So we are encouraging the ladies on the way home today  to whip them out to your fellow commuters, okay? 
[87:00]
 Absolutely.  All right, let's go back to the phone  and see what everyone's talking about here today.  James, you're next on NEW, what's up?  What's up, Bowen A.  How are you?  I'm doing pretty good.  I was driving down, had a hard day's work today,  a union iron worker driving on the yellow.  Whoa, you can't say that.  Oh my.  Oh no.  All right, so you had a bad day.  I had a bad day at work.  You're in your car.  And a girl in a black Jetta lifted up her top  and showed me what she had.  And it made your day, right?  Oh, it made my day.  Cool.  Bowen A. 
[87:30]
 Yeah.  I want to ask you, how could you vote for Bush  when he's all against union workers?  I didn't say, well, I want a McCain.  Yeah, that's what we all wanted.  And I want, and I want Bradley.  I know that doesn't make sense, but...  Yeah, because he's trying to get rid of the union workers in Texas.  No one's going to be able to do that.  No one will worry about that, you don't think?  No, it's like the abortion issue and stuff.  Don't worry about it. 
[88:00]
 No one's going to outlaw it.  It's not even an issue.  I mean, Bush doesn't blow me away, man.  Bush?  Yeah, not at all.  I mean, none of these guys do.  But Gore, I mean, oh...  Well, at least Al Gore used to be with Clinton  and he had the economy going.  Clinton didn't have anything to do with the economy.  Believe me, it was riding a wave.  He just got elected at the right time.  Yeah, the economy was doing well.  It was on an upswing just as he was being elected pretty much.  It turned during the election, I believe, right? 
[88:30]
 Did Bill Clinton come up with all these new businesses  that people started investing huge amounts of money in?  That's true, that's true.  No, he doesn't even know about a screen saver.  Yeah, he thinks a screen saver's amazing.  I don't think Clinton had anything to do with the dot-coms  that completely helped our economy.  I did. I turned on my computer the other day  and I was amazed by the screen saver.  The screen saver was amazing.  James, I think Al Gore is our next president.  Yeah, let's hope so, man. Let's hope so.  I want to feed my kid.  I'm not saying... I just think that's what's going to happen.  I'm not hoping. 
[89:00]
 Al Gore, only if his running mate is Bill Clinton.  That's it.  Who's he going to pick?  He might pick Bradley.  That would be pretty cool.  Kind of pull their resources there.  I don't know.  A ball sack.  Oh, Bradley?  Bradley's got to scrote him under his chin?  Easy, man.  All right, guys, I just want to tell you,  you and I are working directly fast. Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  Don't mess with the X and X, Anthony.  Oh, sorry.  Don't mess with dollar bill. 
[89:30]
 Dollar bill Bradley from the corner.  From the corner?  Wow.  Can you name...  Why?  Well, you can give me back...  I'm detecting my basketball.  You can give me back, like, talking about cartoons and other things.  I just want to ask you a question.  Okay.  Name two players...  Yeah.  ...that Bradley played with on the next...  Don't write it down, Rick.  Okay.  Don't write it down on the next...  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two? 
[90:00]
 God, ponderous.  I know you could do it, Ed.  Come on.  Two.  Two that Bradley played with.  All right.  Two players that Bradley played with.  See, we're trying to add a sports star show here.  This would be a good thing to throw out there.  Can you give me the years?  Like, 72.  72.  72-ish.  Bradley.  Give or take a year or two.  Okay.  Did he play with Wilt?  Wilt was with Los Angeles, right?  Well, they played during the same era.  Very good.  There was a couple championships there where the Knicks did play the Lakers.  See, I knew he was with the Lakers.  Okay.  Okay.  Let me think.  No, in all seriousness...  I'm thinking. 
[90:30]
 Because it's funnier if you don't know, but I'm really curious.  Come on, dude.  Bradley and...  We need sports on our show.  Help me out here.  I'm thinking.

You want to know something, you're gonna laugh.  Yeah.  Because I was listening so hard to those greeting cards that Dice gave that I didn't make it  to the bathroom to leak. And I'm pre-boiling right now. I had to toss my drawers in the  can.  You wet himself?  I wet myself.  You wet yourself with?  I haven't done that in a long time. I was a little kid. You made me laugh that hard.  Oh, that's good. It was good, you know? But now I gotta go give an estimate. I gotta go 
[103:00]
 to somebody's house. I gotta stop and change my jeans. They're gonna think I'm like one  of those sickos that piss themselves, you know?  Did you have the dump sweats, too?  Huh? No.  The dump sweats, no, huh?  No.  Alright, Jimmy, well, try to control your bladder.  They're not making me laugh so hard.  Alright, man.  Goodbye.  Bye, Jimmy. Jimmy, having fun with the show today.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mary Ann. Haven't had many ladies on the show today. Mary Ann, what's going  on?  Hello.  I have a problem.  Why do you have a problem? 
[103:30]
 I know my boyfriend listens to your radio station, religiously.  Okay.  And he won't take me to a strip bar.  He will.  Maybe you would convince him.  Why won't he take you to the strip club?  I have no idea. I'm begging him.  And why do you want to go to the strip club?  Yeah.  Why not?  You want to know what goes on there? I mean, why are you going? There's gotta be a reason.  I want to go and see the girls.  Maybe you're making a paranoid. Why, you get turned on by other women?  Well, kind of. If they have me girls, they're attractive. 
[104:00]
 All right. And he has a problem with that?  Yeah. His friends will take me, but my boyfriend won't take me.  So his friends take you to the strip club?  So his friends would take me if he would let me go.  Yeah, sure. And what does he say when you ask him?  He says no. No way.  But he has to give you a reason.  I don't know. He doesn't give me a reason. He's more or less paranoid, I guess.  Well, he should obviously bring you there.  Especially if it's going to turn you on a little bit. That's a nice little fantasy to check out, right? 
[104:30]
 Our sexual tension all the way between both of us.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Does he bang you nice or what?  Excuse me?  Does he bang you?  Oh, of course.  Yeah. All right. I don't know. Go yourself.  I can't go myself. I've got to go with my boyfriend so I can go back and have sex with him.  Yeah, but he wants to have sex with the strippers.  Oh, hell no.  No, I'm just kidding. Of course.  Maybe you can kind of convince him that taking a girlfriend to a strip bar is a good thing. 
[105:00]
 Well, if he gives us a call, we'll talk to him about it.  Great.  I think he should bring you, though.  Oh, I think so. Definitely.  I think you guys would have a great time.  I've kissed a girl already. I might as well go and see her strip.  You have.  Yes, I have.  How was it?  It was good. Very good.  All right, hold on. Rich is going to give you some advice.  Maybe not. Hold on. Hold on. Where am I? Okay, let's go here and here. 
[105:30]
 Hey, Rich.  Yeah.  You got some advice for Marianne?  Yeah. Hey, don't go.  Don't go?  I took my wife there. I took her to the strip clubs and she left me for another woman.  Whoa.  Hey, heavy.  No, no, no. I love men.  So did she.  Oh, no. I need men.  So did she. So she met a woman.  So Rich, what happened? You took her to the strip club and did you go away with one of the strippers or that just sent her down the path? 
[106:00]
 Well, that just sent her down the path.  And she started hanging out with women.  Oh, yeah. Once she got with the lesbian, that's it, man.  Really?  Oh, yeah. Big time. Very, how can I say, militant group.  That's going to suck when your lady leaves you for a lady.  Why would it do that?  Well, it was fun for her in the beginning, but when they leave you big time, then it does suck.  Yeah. All right. Well, thank you, Rich.  Hey, anytime.  All right. Rich says, don't go. Let's see what Alan says. 
[106:30]
 He's not helping.  Hey, Alan.  How you doing, guys?  Good. You took your girlfriend to the strip club.  Yeah. I took her on Sunday to, when I went to Atlantic City, I took her to a place called the Booby Trap. Well, that's what they call it.  The Booby Trap.  Yeah.  Great name.  I love strip club names. They're the best.  Yeah, right?  Okay. And?  It was all so nude. Nudity. And I sat down by the bar, by, you know, by where they danced, by the stage, and no girls would come up to me. 
[107:00]
 But when she left, they came up to me. Doesn't that sound weird?  So what, you're one of those guys that wants the girls to come up to you and stuff?  Well, my girlfriend sounded pretty hot for me, like, you know, to be giving those naked women money and stuff.  But I was all thugged out. I had my hat, had my hat come back with, and my baggy jeans on.  My girlfriend was like, oh, you look so cool, thug, give me money for these girls.  And meanwhile, I was just like, you know, not getting any girls to come up to me. But when she left, they came up to me.  Okay. Terrific. 
[107:30]
 Exactly. All right, Alan.  All right. Thanks a lot.  Thanks for adding to this discussion.  All right.  It was awesome.  All right.  All right. Bye.  Bye.  Wow. I don't know what the hell is he saying. I have no idea.  Well, Marianne, I think you're on your own. I was trying to get you some advice, but obviously it's not working, so.  Well, thank you. And thank you again for letting me wow for the first time on stage at Mokey's.  Which one were you?  I was the one that was in the back bar. You pulled the spotlight on me. I had the yellow shirt on. 
[108:00]
 Oh, yeah. You had some fine fun bags.  That would be I.  Yes. I remember you.  Yeah, that's me.  Yeah. He should definitely bring you to a strip club.  Don't you think so?  Yes.  Thank you.  All right, Marianne. We got to let you go.  Bye.  All right. Bye.  All right. That went nowhere with her. So let's, we got to take a break, Anthony.  All righty. A couple more great stories to get to today.  Diarrhea in Jamaica. 
[108:30]
 Yeah.  Al Sharpton going to jail.  What happened there?  Prankster sells girls' virginity on the web. And Thirsty Monkey's stone hurts men to death.  Got to be story of the day.  Who the hell is turning their dial now? Stay there. We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, those guys are fast.  1027 WNEW.  It's WIPML Wednesday today.  A little preview of what you can expect later on when WOW hits for good, when the warm weather is upon us for good, Anthony. 
[109:00]
 Yes. We want to give the newer listeners a little taste of what's going on out there.  JC, what's going on?  Hey, guys. What's up?  How are you today?  I am doing awesome.  Oh, good.  Listen to this. I'm up here at Westchester, and it really, WOW hasn't gotten up here that much. It hardly ever happens.  So me and my friend are driving up the iconic state parkway, get up a whole carload of like three or four hot chicks are alongside of us. 
[109:30]
 They have a WOW sign in their car. We have, it's myself and my friend, we have all over our car, we have them all over.  Two chicks in the backseat. They WOW us.  And now we're like, we're on top of the world, real hot. So they pull alongside of us again.  They roll down the window and they tell us, it's your turn. Scream.  So we're like, we're taken by it. We're like, what the hell do we do? 
[110:00]
 And I'm in the passenger seat, so I didn't know what to do.  Did you return the favor or what?  Whipped out the hog.  Whipped out the hog.  Whipped out the hog.  All right.  Just one more quick thing, guys.  Yeah.  You got to let J. Moore know, what are we going to do about this? That whole deal?  Yeah.  A friend of mine's little brother was having a problem getting girls to get to the next level.  How old is this kid?  16.  Oh, all right.  So he goes, he asked, he confided in me for advice. 
[110:30]
 Yeah.  And I decided to pull enough J. Moore's theory.  So you gave the J. Moore advice, which basically is to expose yourself and tell the lady, what are we going to do about this?  Yeah, she slapped his face.  Well, it doesn't work every time.  It doesn't work every time.  It was so funny though, because the guys who were listening were trying to keep a straight face.  Yeah.  So, and the kid took it for real, and he did it, and he came back in a lot of disappointment, but then we let him in on the little clue.  Well, I was reading a bunch of emails from guys that have tried the J. Moore move, and it worked quite nicely. 
[111:00]
 If you find the right girl, I guess.  Yeah, you got to feel out the situation a little bit, though.  Awesome.  Guys, thanks a lot, man.  Thanks, JC. Congratulations on your wow.  Awesome. Thanks.  All right.  All right.  Our buddy Jeff Norris checking in.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on, man?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Great. What's up?  What's up, Ant?  Hey.  Oh, man. Listen to this, guys.  Get a little bummed out.  You know, I didn't get the radio chick gig, but...  Well, you do know you were one of the finalists, right?  Yeah, I do know that.  I wish Chuck the best of luck, you know, but now I got to keep an Anthony's feeling, bust that damn pin. 
[111:30]
 So, Anthony could be late.  But I treated myself.  I went out.  I bought a Dodge Ram truck, waxed it today.  I don't believe in putting stickers on a new vehicle, but I had to put the own A-Sign on, you know?  Yeah, the wow.  So I'm driving down to Garden State Parkway.  I get beeped at. I get beeped at.  All of a sudden, I get a double.  The driver flashes your cans.  The car just stands up, and it was W-O-B, without beef.  No, come on.  I'm telling you.  Did you push it up against the glass? 
[112:00]
 I was going nuts.  I wanted the player to be like, well, jeez, getting a truck there, huh?  It was nice, man.  All right on, man.  It was cool.  It was cool.  You guys made the truck, and hopefully we'll get up there to see you soon.  Cool.  This is, yeah, we're doing a preview of Wow today.  Anthony's trying to knock down the webcam that is set up in the studio.  Oh, man, you guys are nuts, man.  I miss you guys, man, but we'll be up soon.  Yeah, come on by and say hi, Jeff. All right?  Definitely. Keep up the good work.  All right, brother.  See you, fellas.  There he goes.  Jeff Norris, very funny guy. 
[112:30]
 Go see him when you get a chance.  Brian's next.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, yo.  What's up?  Yeah, just a little update in the sports world.  It seems that you guys lasted longer at any W than Boomer lasted at ABC on Monday Night Football.  Yeah, I just read that.  Yeah.  They're letting him go, huh?  Yeah, looks that way.  Oh, God, I feel very good.  What was the reason?  How about ratings?  They don't fire them for ratings.  I don't know.  Maybe he wasn't as good as he was supposed to be.  I don't think he was very good at that.  Is he stepping down, or do they officially fire him? 
[113:00]
 Well, I think they're going in a different direction, which is a nice way to say we're letting them go.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks for the news.  Boomer out.  Yeah.  Well, how did I get on the show today?  Was it Spaz not picking up?  Is Spaz isn't picking up the phone today?  Spaz is just kind of walking around.  I don't know.  I don't know what he's doing today.  Yeah.  Well, that's why I got on, because Spaz didn't pick up the phone.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Be cool.  Bye. 
[113:30]
 Breaking news, Anthony.  Boomer's out.  I didn't know he had football.  What a shame.  And we didn't get to interview Boomer about the time you and him fought.  My old classmate from back in Timberpoint Elementary School in East Islip way back when.  I believe that was fourth grade, maybe fifth grade, something like that.  I went to school with Boomer.  Elementary school.  We've tried to have him on the show a few times.  Yeah.  I'm curious about how you broke your arm punching him in the head. 
[114:00]
 Yeah, he won't come on the show.  It's a true story.  I wonder if he'll remember that.  Probably.  Yeah, the Boomer.  All right, and you want to move on to other things here?  Yeah, there's plenty of stuff in the news today.  Do you want to hear about Al Sharpton, a prankster selling a girl's virginity on the web, thirsty monkeys, stone herdsmen to death, or diarrhea in Jamaica?  I like the diarrhea story. That's pretty funny.  Diarrhea in Jamaica, okay? 
[114:30]
 Let me see that.  All right, let me read a little bit of this for our listeners here.  Diarrhea, wave, hits prisons, supper blame.  In Kingston, Jamaica.  Jamaican prison.  Jamaican prison.  That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh?  And all the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper.  A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than a thousand convicts suffering. 
[115:00]
 Doctors are struggling frantically to contain the outbreak, which inmates have blamed on their Sunday supper.  The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering.  Spicy crab soup.  Spicy crab soup.  Chinese cabbage.  Chinese cabbage.  Rice, peas, and chicken.  No, no, they didn't have the rice, peas, and chicken.  Sunday meal of rice, peas, and chicken. 
[115:30]
 Opie, you're getting the story wrong.  I preach it kind of...  Oh, they should have got the rice, peas, and chicken, but instead they got the spicy crab soup and the Chinese cabbage.  And some kind of vegetable taro.  Taro.  Whatever that is.  And...  Oh, no.  Diarrhea, cha-cha-cha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Angry prisoners on Monday dump scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the cell blocks in protest. 
[116:00]
 That's great.  So they have the bad supper.  Everyone has diarrhea.  Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags.  You know what's great?  You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys.  What do they do?  They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages.  Correct.  Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons.  No.  Oh my God, throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea.  That's great.  Now the treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells for medication fearing attacks from other inmates. 
[116:30]
 A special security team was going to cells to give inmates on the spot treatment if needed.  This medical team had to go from cell to cell to give them treatment as there's diarrhea all over their cells.  I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked and ran away.  That old gag.  All right, so they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the epidemic. 
[117:00]
 But there you have it.  A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica suffering from diarrhea, Anthony.  Diarrhea.  After a bad Sunday supper. 
[117:30]
 Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[118:00]
 Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[118:30]
 Don't I hope that's the discordant.  except for you?  Ok, terrific.  Jump see just a little Zion Jump see the S重要 
[119:00]
 Oh, spraying mud in Jamaica.  I like the new pathway. 
[119:30]

[120:00]
 Oh, I'm gonna be a bad man.  I wanna jive with all of you.  Hey!  I'm gonna be a bad man.  I'm gonna be a bad man.  All I know is that I'm gonna be a bad man.  I'm gonna be a bad man. 
[120:30]
 The wooden was at the bottom of it.  He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there.  Hey!  That would definitely put a damper on it.  Hey!  Yeah, that would wreck the party, wouldn't it?  Absolutely.  You suck.  Keep it up.  All right, David.  Hey!  The prison looks like the mud people from Woodstein. 
[121:00]
 We had guys lifting stuff with their units.  Pro-test.  Excuse me, taking a big, tasteless...  You've got to get our protective membrane vaginal seal back up.  I thought I had no panties on.  Hey!  That is the rest of the jungle.  Insane.  We had guys come in that enjoy getting kicked in the nats. 
[121:30]
 You really don't know where the...  Ivory has reloaded.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, that one just over eight feet.  O-B-E-M-A.  Dopey ass show.  W-A-E-W.  Yes.  Having lots of fun today.  Hell yeah.  Giving everyone a preview of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today. 
[122:00]
 Couldn't help ourselves.  It's such a nice day.  Tanya, what's going on?  Hi, it's Tanya.  I just wowed this guy like three times.  It was so funny.  Oh, thank you.  Where are you?  I was driving and he was like chasing me on the brungs of a parkway.  It was so funny.  I have a wild sign and he has it like on his dirty Chevrolet something.  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  But he kept going, one more time, one more time.  I didn't know what he was chasing me for.  No, we don't want the other guys chasing 180s.  He was on a chase on the brungs of a parkway.  Now he's going to the White Stone Bridge.  Just enjoy the wow and move on. 
[122:30]
 And move on with your lives.  Three times.  I cut him off at the drug.  All right.  But you're flashing everyone out there for us today?  For you guys.  I went to you guys.  Well, we appreciate it.  We're hoping all the ladies do some flashing on the way home tonight.  I love you guys.  You know, I miss Jay Moore.  On Friday I went home.  Yeah?  And I rented a picture perfect.  I watched it Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  My husband is like, you're crazy.  Oh, really?  I miss Jay Moore, though.  You're obsessed with Jay Moore?  I'm not obsessed. 
[123:00]
 You should be checking in someday this week.  We'll see.  I miss him.  And Anthony, you are extra funny.  Yeah.  My car is turning off the radio every time I got you guys on.  Anthony is off the chart today.  Look, I'm funny.  All right.  Well, keep the flashing going out there for us, OK?  Thanks.  I love you guys.  All right.  We love you.  Keep up with the show.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  I'm going to flash the guys on the way home today.  Little preview.  Yeah.  Little pre-season.  That's it.  That's all we're saying.  That's all we're trying to say, if you think about it really. 
[123:30]
 Joe, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, O&A?  How are you?  Not too bad.  Yeah.  My work van had no signs on, loud signs on the van, so I had a sign just written, and  I was going past down 22, and I just looked at a sign, a colorful of girls, and they just  started wowing me, man.  They started showing everything.  It was great.  Oh, awesome.  Yeah, the girls are very excited to wow today, Anthony.  Yes.  It's a beautiful thing.  I just want to tell you guys I love your show, man.  Thank you. 
[124:00]
 Just imagine when this starts really kicking in, the Whippermill Wednesday.  It's going to be just off the hook.  Oh, I know.  I can't wait.  Off the hook, yo.  Yo.  I got a story to tell you guys, though.  Huh?  Nest-Bextean to Viagra.  What?  Nest-Bextean to Viagra.  I swear to God, I had a flu a couple weeks ago, and I was picking Dayquil.  Had a few drinks one night, and to tell you what, all night long, it was phenomenal.  It definitely works, fellas.  Just Dayquil and a few beers.  A few beers, way about an hour, and it's telling you it works. 
[124:30]
 Going for a couple hours, fellas.  Thank you, Joe.  Just try it out.  All right, man.  Take care, fellas.  Bye.  They don't advise you to try that out, right?  Dave, what's going on?  How you doing, O&A?  Great.  All right, I'm a new listener.  Yeah?  And I just got wowed twice.  Oh, cool.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Well, we're trying to preview it today, and it looks like it's working out there.  It's excellent.  All right.  Hey, listen.  Yeah?  I'm going to ECW pay-per-view Sunday.  All right.  I'm in the second row right on TV.  What would you like me to put on my sign?  Wow would be good. 
[125:00]
 Wow?  Yes.  How about we deliver Keggers and a wow sign?  That could work, too.  Any sign that's related to the show we love seeing on TV.  Excellent.  Just use your imagination, your creativity, okay?  All right.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Indication news.  All right, bye.  Bye.  The old boss is outside the studio.  I got to...  What's he doing?  I got to make fun of him really fast.  Why?  Hey, boss.  Hey, old boss.  Old boss in the studio.  You know, I heard you trashing my basketball tickets.  The guy that brought us to New York.  Boss, you don't like me anymore.  I love you.  You don't like me anymore.  I told you, boss. 
[125:30]
 Let me...  Well, I gave the tickets to Vancouver.  Yeah.  Well, first of all...  Wait, listen, listen.  Let me...  First of all, I want to win.  I want to win.  I want to win.  I want to win.  I want to win.  I want to win.  Wait, listen, listen.  First of all, you saw a win.  Huh?  You saw a win.  I didn't see a win because I left really early.  I assumed they were going to win when I left the garden last night.  I got to say, the last year when you were officially our boss...  Right.  And how many tickets did I get to the Knick games?  Tons.  Yeah.  A lot. 
[126:00]
 And I got all the hot games.  The hot games.  Lakers, Celtics.  You know, this year, Vancouver.  And your point is?  Vancouver is the...  What's the team?  What game did I take you to?  What game did we go to, Anthony?  We went to...  Was that team with the black guys on it?  No, not Toronto.  You saved those for somebody else.  I would love to see Toronto.  Well, it's a bit of an earl groveling outside my door.  You have any tickets to no one else?  I don't go up there and bother you for tickets that much.  What, does a black girl want hockey tickets?  Camp festival.  You know, all tickets are equal.  Yeah.  Every game...  I've had it.  Why didn't you want to go to the Vancouver game?  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did. 
[126:30]
 I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  What was it?  It was last night?  And whoever you gave the other two seats to because you have four?  They didn't show up either?  They didn't show up because the game sucked so bad.  Man.  The game was beat.  Vancouver...  Actually, I was home last night.  Yeah?  But I watched the game.  So I was technically there.  Ah, yeah.  I just wasn't with you.  I was with you in the spirit.  How's traffic on the Ones? 
[127:00]
 You know what?  I haven't been up there in about 20 minutes, but last I checked, it was still on the Ones.  It was on the Ones?  I don't know how you do it.  There's all this news, okay?  No, bear with me.  There's all this news every day on 1010 wins, which you are the GM of.  And it doesn't matter how much news or how little news there is any given day, on the  Ones, there's traffic.  You go to traffic.  It's amazing, right?  How do you fill the spots between the Ones? 
[127:30]
 With news and everything else that goes on, no matter how much or little, where every  10 minutes on the Ones, there's traffic.  If I told you how we did it, I'd have to kill you.  That's true.  See, it's one of the trade secrets.  It's a secret.  It's a secret.  That's great.  I love the traffic.  But you know what?  Yesterday driving home, I was listening to you guys at the 6 o'clock hour.  We got you on the studio, so I didn't see you.  Here's the guy that brought us to New York.  Oh my God, he looks like Luca Brasi in this picture.  He really does.  Tony Soprano, right? 
[128:00]
 Yeah.  So last night I'm driving home and I'm listening to the show.  Yeah.  And I don't know, you've got some young girl on.  Everyone's giving her advice.  Oh, anal sex advice?  Another one of those days that I said, it's so much more fun to listen to this show than  to be the general.  Thank God you're not in charge anymore.  Exactly.  You know, the new boss said exactly what you said.  Did he really?  He said, you guys are going to be something if you don't blow yourselves up.  Yeah.  He was trying to get a little into you.  He's all right.  So you're trying to say that he sounded a little like me?  A little bit. 
[128:30]
 A little bit.  You could tell.  Ken was like, I've never heard him talk like that since he's been here.  And all of a sudden it's like, yeah, yeah, no, no, you guys will do great.  You don't self-destruct.  You don't self-destruct and get yourself fired.  I like the guy that runs one of the radio networks in town.  He says to me, God, you look great.  You look better than you looked at about two years, I said.  He goes, yeah, two years.  We are like a cancer that has been taken out of you.  And it's in total remission.  I love you too.  You guys are like my fourth and fifth children. 
[129:00]
 Yes.  A little less mature than your real children.  You look so much healthier, boss.  Those children that you have to keep going to school for for drug problems.  I'll look for better tickets.  I'll look for better tickets for you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I will check my stash.  Really?  Yeah.  Because Vancouver was really boring.  In fact, to make-  Your girlfriend was bored too.  To make it up to you.  Yeah.  To make it up to you.  Because I know Anthony doesn't like basketball.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You want to go to the Big East Championship game on Saturday nights. 
[129:30]
 Whoa, yes.  Come see me tomorrow.  Okay.  I can handle that.  Did you hear who Anthony is picking in the 20 this year?  Iona.  I'm going to Spazz's alma mater.  Iona College.  Remember our deal with Spazz and Iona?  Yeah.  Remember that?  I remember that.  They wanted to throw Spazz out of school and not give him a diploma because he worked on this show.  They wanted to throw Spazz out, but they let Jeff Ruhl and Coach explain that.  Isn't that amazing?  Hey, boss.  Life isn't fair.  You've got to be honest with me though. 
[130:00]
 I know you look so much better since you've abandoned us.  And I'm sure you feel a lot better.  But there isn't just a piece of you when you're upstairs maybe in a meeting with Larry Kofsky  talking about what he should do first, the Dow or the NASDAQ.  Ooh.  Maybe there's a piece that just-  There was a little bit of excitement in your life there when you were in charge of this ship.  And I said ship.  No.  Either word would have been appropriate.  Really?  So you don't miss us?  No, that's not true. 
[130:30]
 No, it was a great time.  You don't miss the phone calls where people are yelling at us through the speakerphone?  I don't miss that.  And lawyers knocking on your door all hours of the day?  If that's not Herman, are you the gentleman?  Those two idiots, degenerates you have on your station, I'm going to file with everybody,  the CIA.  The worst calls were, how could you run 10-10 wins and put those guys on the air?  God damn, what the hell are you doing?  You can't keep them boys in control. 
[131:00]
 We love them.  We've had a long, prosperous career with the company.  And they're doing very well, I understand that.  But I don't care what the ratings are.  They don't put any more crap like they put in their dog.  We had to hear that in his office, wherever that is.  We're getting yelled at.  Nothing worse than your boss's boss yelling at you in front of your boss.  Oh my God.  He would sit us down on his fine leather couch up there.  And all of a sudden he would go, someone wants to talk to you.  And I would be like, ugh. 
[131:30]
 And this is what would come through the speakers.  Boss, I swear to God you are gone.  If I hear anything else, I'll keep them going.  You can't do it.  Now it's calls like this.  Hey Scott, how's it going?  How's traffic on the ones?  Very good.  I love that traffic on the ones.  Money coming in?  Good, good.  You're doing great.  Great.  But mark my words.  Wow, that's good. 
[132:00]
 He gets to play golf during the day and all that.  Golf.  He's doing back to his lunches.  He's smiling at patsies.  He's having a great time.  No longer having to deal with these two bastard stepchildren.  Well, I love you boys.  Sorry, got to go.  There he goes.  Look, he could just leave now.  He doesn't have to worry about the rest of the show.  Okay, terrific.  There you go.  Thanks a lot, Scott.  Scott Herman.  Okay, terrific.  Yes.  Quick, Scott.  You only got three minutes before traffic on the ones. 
[132:30]
 Make sure you get the right traffic.  There you go.  Scott Herman, the guy who brought us to New York, who's no longer our boss.  Now we can really abuse him.  It's great, isn't it?  Isn't it the best?  You know, I understand he's a lot more relaxed and stuff, but you can't tell me that he goes  upstairs to wins and he's having a gay old time.  Just a great shindig party going on upstairs at 1010 wins.  Yeah, he's got to miss the party.  He's got to miss the party.  He's got to miss the party.  He's got to miss the party.  He's got to miss the party.  He's got to miss the party. 
[133:00]
 He's got to miss the party.  He's got to miss the debauchery of the Opien Anthony show.  Oh, remember that?  Yesterday, we were in our office and a couple of guys, who was it?  Who came down?  One of the sales guys or was it somebody from wins?  Oh yeah, Pete, the engineer comes in and he goes, hey, there's pizza upstairs at wins.  So we're like, oh damn, we ordered lunch already, but what are they doing? 
[133:30]
 Having a party up at wins?  They're like, yeah, they're celebrating Super Tuesday.  They were having like a big party up there to celebrate Super Tuesday.  They're crazy up there at wins.  You know what wins is like?  Wins is like the AV squad in school.  Remember the kids, they knew how to run the movie projectors.  And when the film used to go, they knew where to stick the pencil eraser to make it stop.  That's with them. 
[134:00]
 That's the math team.  It's just not fair because wins is upstairs.  We're down here and our lives have to collide.  They hate sharing their pizza with us.  Pizza party?  Oh my God, Lee Harris is out of control.  Look at him.  He's got a wins night flag on his head and he's jumping around.  He's dancing with John Montone.  The word gets out that there's free food in the building.  We go upstairs and try to snag some like anyone would.  And they give us the look like, oh, they're up here.  It's just culture shock. 
[134:30]
 And then they have to run into all the crazy lunatics that stuff.  They are showing a daily basis when they're trying to do their traffic on the ones.  Pizza on the ones.  We're wack zinerrific on this Super Tuesday.  I don't know, Super Tuesday.  I might actually have a drink.  They're wacky celebrating Super Tuesday.  They're just waiting for the glory.  There's pictures upstairs of the Avianca crash. 
[135:00]
 They're just waiting for another glory day of a nice good New York plane crash.  A good snow storm or something.  In the meantime, just make sure that traffic's on the ones.  In the meantime, they've got to check out the people in the lobby waiting to come on our show.  Jesus.  I'm John Montone and I want pepperoni.  Yes.  Having a blast? 
[135:30]
 Yes.  Jessica.  Hey, guys.  How are you, Jessica?  Great.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  I just wanted to tell all the ladies that it's a total rush to wow.  And the fact that guys love it no matter what you look like, you have to go out and do it for them.  That's still a good set.  I'm telling you.  Foreign boob rocks.  Exactly.  What I'm saying is I'm not very large chested.  That's okay.  I feel hesitant to do it and I did it and they love it anyway.  It makes it so good.  Sure.  It makes their week. 
[136:00]
 Yeah, it totally does.  Although I have to say one thing and I'm totally not trying to change the subject.  Okay.  But if the Yankees play in regular season the way they're playing in preseason right now,  my wowing is going to slow down a whole lot.  No.  Don't worry about it.  It's preseason.  They're still weaning themselves off of the cocaine for the season.  It's okay.  Yeah, they don't do that well in preseason all the time anyway, but I'm upset.  The Mets won last night.  Oh, gee.  Holy cow. 
[136:30]
 Only eight billion games to go.  I hope they do okay.  I hate you people that get into the preseason like this.  It means nothing.  I don't know why George Steinbrenner is freaking.  It means nothing.  The season hasn't started.  They're trying to figure out who they want.  They're trying to figure out their pitching rotation, who's going to make the team.  Don't worry about it.  They're trying out stuff.  You want to try stuff out during the real season?  No.  No.  So you do it on preseason.  Yeah.  I really don't normally care.  I never, ever pay attention, but everybody is ribbing me. 
[137:00]
 Oh, you're a Yankee fan.  You're a Yankee fan, and they're doing so bad.  So I just wanted to let everybody know.  It doesn't matter.  I don't even follow preseason.  They have the scores.  Warner Wolf is doing the scores the other night.  The Yankees could be in trouble.  You know, we just need a good tragedy.  The Yankees need a good tragedy.  The Daryl Strawberry thing, it's not really a tragedy.  It's tragic, but in its own right.  Somebody needs cancer.  We all were expecting him to fall off the wagon.  We need one of those tragedy stories for the Yankees. 
[137:30]
 Come on, Jeter's got a hemorrhoid.  Because they get one every year, right?  They do. It's crazy.  They rally around tragedies, though.  Well, you know, maybe they'll be listening to you guys in the spring,  and you'll hear the fact that their female fans really want them to win,  and they'll make New York happy.  And Jessica, screw that.  How bad do you want to bang Derek Jeter?  No way! No way!  Who do you want to bang on the Yankees?  If you had your chance for a throwdown.  You know, I really... 
[138:00]
 Come on.  I think Tino Martinez is better looking than Derek Jeter.  Chuck Knoblok, right? Knoblok.  Ew!  He's not even a good player, let alone good looking.  Well, who would you have throwdown?  Have you...  Yeah, you know what I'm saying.  I'm getting tired here.  You want Joe Torre?  You want Torre?  No way. None of them. None of them.  Just imagine what he could do with that nose.  The Zim. The Zim.  I definitely don't...  Don Zimmer putting on his army helmet and going in. 
[138:30]
 Don Zimmer.  I don't think Jeter's that hot, but he's...  With Don, you get the penetration,  but also the stimulation from his belly rubbing on your most intimate of areas.  No, but he's definitely better looking than...  I can't believe they put him up against Piazza.  Yeah.  He's nasty.  Alright, so let's talk about ballplayers and how good they look.  Okay, let's talk about the fact that...  I don't know, you gotta give it to Piazza.  Who has a better ass, Don Zimmer or Joe Torre?  Remember they had that in the paper, what, last year? 
[139:00]
 Zimmer, I don't know, it's gotta be a few dimples on that one.  No, it was, who had a better ass, Piazza or Jeter?  Piazza, Jeter.  I'm gonna go with Piazza.  No, screw that though, Zimmer or Torre?  Who would you bet on that, Don?  Who would you throw a charity F to?  That's really tough, it's really tough.  Come on.  Really tough choice.  Come on, yeah, you're crazy worried about the Yankees.  We gotta worry about the Knicks.  Yeah.  Knicks don't have a...  not a prayer.  I don't think there's anything to worry about anymore. 
[139:30]
 Their minds pretty much made up, right?  Who?  The Knicks.  The Knicks?  Nah, they're gonna give it a run for the money this year.  I hope so, because I...  I know you're rooting for them, Opie, so I hope so.  Yes, I am.  But you know what?  Lakers are gonna win it all.  Unstoppable.  Unfreaking stoppable.  Basketball.  Sorry, sorry, Anthony, sorry.  Is that okay?  Is that okay with you?  Well, how do they pick the team?  They go to the lineup and whoever's above the seven foot mark, they put on the team?  Is it okay that the Lakers win the championship?  What are you, high? 
[140:00]
 Of course I'm gonna be bummed.  But that's reality, they gotta...  You sound like you're cheering them on.  No.  I think that...  I don't see anyone beating them this year.  You think that Utah Jazz is gonna do it?  No, no.  You think the Spurs are gonna do it again this year?  No, no.  I just said that you sounded like you were cheering them on and I just don't...  You know, you switch around a lot with your teams, I think.  No, no, basketball, Knicks, all the way.  All the way.  Girls in sports, this is great.  How big are your fun bags? 
[140:30]
 What I do is I'm a Mets fan, but when the Mets get knocked out, then I help the Yankees along.  I cheer them a little bit.  That's a little weird, I understand.  And I'm an Islander fan, not a Ranger fan.  Well, I'm the only one that's gonna admit it around here.  That's true.  Yeah, I know, I heard you guys talking about that a few weeks ago.  The Islanders, too bad for them, right?  All right, Jessica.  If the team doesn't show up, attendance is down 50%.  Okay, guys, we're gonna move on for you, all right?  Thank you, Jessica, thank you for wowing. 
[141:00]
 We appreciate that today.  We hope all the ladies do that today on the way home, okay?  No problem, see you guys later.  All right, Jessica, what are our sports report today?  You can't look at that.  And we dug up something from the ONA archives.  We'll be back in just a bit, stay there.  111027 WNEW.  Speaking of baseball, did you see the article in the Daily News today?  They've got to get this point of view across the board.  Baseball diamonds are a gal's best friend.  Oh, the hunk-o-meter.  Yeah, they're pitting a Jeter against Piazza. 
[141:30]
 Obviously, for a hunk, who's the biggest hunk?  Who's the biggest hunk?  Yeah, Jeter or Piazza.  She's got a bunch of stats and everything.  This is Cheryl Connolly from the Daily News.  You know, this lady smokes crack.  She has to.  I'm not sure if she's a good player or not.  You know, this lady smokes crack.  She has to.  She's writing a whole article on this, right, Amp?  Yeah.  And where he'd take you for a weekend getaway, Dirk Jeter.  This lady assumes that Dirk Jeter would take you to meet his mom. 
[142:00]
 Oh, sure, yeah.  I don't care that the court's going to be Yankee.  Is that what he calls his penis, Mom?  Exactly.  I'll take you to meet my mom.  She's delusional.  He's a guy, for Christ's sake.  Where'd she live, the Comac Motorway?  Odds on getting to third base with Dirk Jeter.  Only if you're a pop diva who can hit the high notes.  Oh, ho, ho.  I think she's trying to be wacky.  Wow, that was worth being on page nine in the Daily News today. 
[142:30]
 Is this sports?  Odds on getting to third base with Piazza.  Only if you could dress flashier than he does.  Does any sports fan really care about this?  I guess she's catering to the ladies or something.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I'm Maggidda Maddog on the fan.  Today we're taking phone calls.  Yeah, you know, who's the biggest hunk?  Come on, look at Jeter with Piazza.  You gotta give Jeter a lot of credit.  I mean, he's got a nice ass.  Look at him. 
[143:00]
 Hey, Maddog, are you trying to tell me you're bored with taking phone calls about the Mets and the Yankees?  Well, this is in the paper today.  I think it's sports over here, over here.  What would you like to talk to?  Sports, you know, concerned sports.  Would you like to talk to some of your listeners today?  Yeah, why not?  I think we could take a few phone calls.  All right, why don't you throw the topic out there?  Well, who's the biggest hunk?  Jeter with Piazza.  Yeah, I've seen him both.  I've been looking at him.  Jeter, I gotta give Jeter the ass.  But Piazza's got the arms, and I think Piazza's a little hairier. 
[143:30]
 I prefer my man with a hairy chest.  And not enough, I like Piazza.  He's squatting all the time, being a catcher.  And you don't want the testicles dragging in the dirt like that.  It can make calluses, and I don't think I want to handle callus-y testicles.  Ain't that right, Mickey?  That's right, the Wook.  And gee, he's been with some housebags in his day,  but I think I could turn him around.  I'd take him in the back seat of my Toyota.  Toyota.  So who would you give the rusty trombone to? 
[144:00]
 Well, you gotta go with Piazza and the rusty trombone.  Because I'm not reaching for the testicles,  I'm not giving him a reach around.  But you gotta figure out what to catch him.  He's squatting a lot of air blowing through that dirt.  It's not gonna stink, he's maybe a Jeter, but standing up a lot.  All right, let's go to the phones, all right?  It's a great topic for your show today on WFAG.  All right, Joe, you're on the air, not gonna have dog on the back.  Hi, I'd just like to say that much of Piazza has the best ass.  What are you talking about?  You gotta give Jeter the ass. 
[144:30]
 I'm an ass fan, I know, Jeter's got the better ass.  Come on, come on, my friend.  Ain't that bungee steel?  You don't see him there when he's behind the plate,  crouched down or bent over like that.  It gets me so excited.  Thank you, Joe.  You know that's because I get out of hand.  As far as hair does go, I don't know, I kinda like the aqua-fabiazi spotting.  But I didn't like that short thing, Jeter spotting.  You don't like that wacky beard of Piazza's or the wacky sideburns? 
[145:00]
 No, I like a little bit of hair on my dies.  I don't like the short hair that Jeter's got.  But I give him the ass.  That's right, dork.  I've been dressed both of these with my eyes.  And I gotta give him, like I said, the ass that Jeter has.  A chest and arms to Piazza.  Nice, strong, manly arms.  No surprise you like the Giants.  I can probably...  I can probably... 
[145:30]
 Yeah, he appears, I know.  If I'm in a sack with him, he can throw me around like a little spinner.  Now I've got a strong upper body strength.  I think for Jeter, he'll be a lot more sensitive to my feminine needs.  Right, Fede?  That's right, dork.  Joe, you're on the air with Mad Dog.  Is this Mad Dog?  I'm not gonna have Mad Dog now, I'm out of ad.  How you doing?  What do you think, Joe?  I think that Jeter's better.  In what way?  How his turn is better than the barbell.  That's it, Baba Louie! 
[146:00]
 Can't curse on that anymore, Joe.  Oh, brother.  This is just getting bad.  That was pretty funny too, today, I didn't make the air.  Alright, let's take another break here, alright?  Alright, Daddy.  Are you done now, Mad Dog?  Yeah, Mr. Jimmy B.  Why don't you bring Imerson with you today?  You wanna go there? 
[146:30]
 I got my big fag cowboy hat on.  My life here is I'm looking at Piazza.  Yeah.  And it's growing.  Yeah, that guy gets the wrinkle out of my neck.  Opie and Anthony.

I'm having a good goddamn mood.  Having too much fun, eh?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  What else did we want to get to today?  Thirsty Monkeys.  This, I have to say, is the story of the day.  I thought we did story of the day already.  You didn't think the-  Craping Jamaican prisoners?  You didn't think the diarrhea in Jamaica was the story of the day, Anthony? 
[152:00]
 I'm very close to being story of the day.  But, well, you know something?  I think it's a toss-up, but the Jamaican prisoners having diarrhea isn't it?  What about the whole dice greeting cards thing?  No, I think-  That can be story of the day.  His new career, he gave us a taste today.  Clinton and the screen saver being amazing.  Being amazed by the screen saver, Clinton?  Yeah.  That can be story of the day.  Yeah.  I think that was story of the day.  But this, I mean, come on.  How the hell did this happen?  Well, let me read a little bit for you, Anthony. 
[152:30]
 Thirsty Monkey Stone Herdsman to Death.  I love this.  Cue music.  No.  In Nairobi, a group of thirsty monkeys stoned a herdsman to death in drought stricken northern Kenya as he watered his livestock, a newspaper reported Thursday.  Why?  In a clear sign of worsening drought, a herdsman was killed after the rioting monkeys stoned-  Rioting monkeys? 
[153:00]
 Stoned him at a watering point.  A nurse in the district said the man died from severe head injury.  Good aim on the monkeys.  Damn.  Why?  All they wanted was a little bit of water.  Could he not spare a few drops of water for these poor primates?  My God!  Just a little taste of water for their red monkey asses. 
[153:30]
 And everything would have been fine.  He'd have been alive today, but no, he denies the monkeys.  Damn you!  Damn you!  I remember when I needed water, and Zira came up and gave me a drink of water.  God damn it, I loved that monkey bit.  She gave me water. 
[154:00]
 I got water from a monkey.  And he wouldn't give water back to these poor thirsty monkeys?  Damn him!  They gave you a lot of water when you were in that cage with the...  It's a madhouse!  A madhouse!  God damn, good aim on the monkeys.  Head injury.  Yeah.  Crack shots. 
[154:30]
 You know, they couldn't hit me with bullets when Dr. Zayas was shooting.  But they hit him in the head with rocks.  How does a monkey know that the guy has water and he isn't giving it to him?  I don't understand this story.  Explain that one.  There's no way the monkey knows he has water.  He doesn't know to pick up rocks and throw them at him.  Are you sure this was Nairobi?  Maybe they're smarter than we thought.  Yes, they are intelligent. 
[155:00]
 Smart monkeys.  They live in little clay houses.  I've seen it.  Take your sticky paws off me, damn dirty ape!  Oh ho, Nellis.  No, God.  Look at long rocks, it's no fun.  Damn you, monkey.  I just don't get it.  Bunch of riotous monkeys. 
[155:30]
 Let me get this straight.  Riotous monkeys.  Red-ass stupid monkeys.  See a sheep herder.  Yes.  Giving water to his sheep.  Correct.  They get mad because he's not giving them water.  Correct.  And they start throwing rocks.  Right.  Why do they just go and take the water?  I don't know.  There was more of them, right?  Yes.  My God, Nellis. 
[156:00]
 That's an amazing story.  Either this guy is incredibly stupid,  or those are some smart monkeys.  I'd have kicked them in their tiny red asses.  Yes, yes.  What's that, Cornelia?  Zebra's pregnant, and it's not yours.  Damn, they caught me again.  I couldn't take my hands off her. 
[156:30]
 Staggy monkey udders.  That red ass is a bullseye for John.  I love you.  Are you sure?  I still have to go.  I still don't understand.  Are you sure they weren't drinking more liquor?  That's all I gotta say.  Stop it. 
[157:00]
 All right.  Oh, my God.  Maybe it was Reginald Denny.  What?  The other dude.  Bone dry.  Bone dry, damn you.  Apologize it.  Apologize it.  No wonder they throw rocks.  Bone dry, yeah.  Bone dry, yeah. 
[157:30]
 Damn monkeys.  I heard they threw 41 rocks.  Yes, but only 19 hit him.  I heard he was down, and they kept throwing rocks at him.  Bastard monkeys.  Why?  The guy was just holding his wallet.  And they threw rocks at him and continued even as he was down.  Why, damn you? 
[158:00]
 Damn.  They just said, please can we have some water in their native monkey dung.  No justice, no peace.  Absolutely.  Maybe the Yankees can recruit these guys.  He's a cool cat.  A cool cat indeed.  Just said, when you see riotous monkeys, give them water for God's sake.  What's wrong with you?  All right.  Have you ever done it with that smart? 
[158:30]
 There'll be a rally at noon tomorrow.  I've never heard this.  What to do?  What to do?  Riotous monkeys.  All right, listen.  I'm all the water you want.  Try me.  Oh my God.  It's awful.  Okay, terrific.  Yes. 
[159:00]
 All right.  More of your phone calls in just a minute.  Jesus.  Horrifying.  All right, all right, all right.  It keeps coming back.  Fratagizing.  All right, phone number 212-757-1027.  We'll go to the phones next.  Opie and Anthony, those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table.  And we're back. 
[159:30]
 It's the ONA Show.  Having lots and lots of fun today.  Hell yeah.  Benji, what's going on tonight?  Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  I wanted to get mad with you, but then I started laughing so hard.  What are you going to get mad at me for?  Oh, you're bringing up that maybe the monkeys are going to get mad at you.  What?  No.  The monkey stoning the shepherd in Africa?  Yeah.  Opie sat down. 
[160:00]
 He was down and they still started stoning him.  What are you talking about?  So you wanted to be mad, but then you started laughing, right Benji?  Yeah.  A 
[160:30]
 Hanging out and wanted a piece of zero  She wanted no part of me because I had just shaved the hair from my face and she found that as ugly that ironic 
[161:00]
 and all of a sudden I  Wanted a piece of a red monkey manger less  That's the forbidden zone. So what did I do? Yeah, I pulled out my junk and said hey, what are we gonna do about this?  Thank you, J. Moore  It even works with primates 
[161:30]
 I shot a tray up in that piece  Good God, I partook in monkey ass  Once you go monkey you never go go clunky  Doesn't rhyme. I know what I'm talking about. Okay, is Benji. Well, thank you Benji. Oh, you're welcome  You're enjoying the show today. Oh, yeah. Yeah, very good. Yes, you know, I kept saying I wanted to come down  Yeah, I'll do something crazy. There's some crazy. Yeah. I might yeah. Yeah, I've been known to do crazy stuff 
[162:00]
 All right. You want to get into the kiddie pool Friday?  I don't know. I was really thinking about it. Really?

[169:00]
 The penis doctor. Well, the daily news is running a great series  They're running  The 15 most sued doctors in New York and every day they're featuring another doctor  Hey, and today's doctor is the penis doctor. What could you tell the guy on line 11?  Because he's got a code might have a cheat code for an atomic bomb  For the f-a-18.

Hey, how you doing? All right 
[169:30]
 What's the code for okay in the beginning you gotta put semi-colon take it in your rear real hard and then you got the game  Cuz I know this cheat codes  Thanks  All right head off to the penis doctor  Well, I don't know the series is pretty funny every day. They're featuring another doctor 
[170:00]
 That is just the worst the 15 the 15 most sued doctors in New York. Mm-hmm  And this guy is botched up so many damn penis surgeries. It's not even funny  First of all, why would you get get surgery on your penis Anthony? Um to make it bigger or fatter  Yeah, but longer those operations are just not guaranteed whatsoever must be really desperate  Do you know how they make your penis longer? They suck fat. No, no longer longer  Oh, they cut a ligament they cut the base and then they pull it out like you're pulling a cord 
[170:30]
 You know the vacuum cleaners where the cord goes in pulling taffy  Yeah, they pull a little more cord out and then they sew you back up  Yeah, that's what makes it longer cuz you got a good I don't know incher incher so  You know that never comes out never comes out is that the base so they just like you said they cut the ligament  They pull they pull it out like they're pulling more cord out of the vacuum cleaner there  And then they they sew you back up sew the ligament back up. Oh 
[171:00]
 Now you can explain the  Making the penis thicker one Anthony. Yeah, they take fat from various places on your body and inject it into your  into your ween  To make it fatter  Blow it up like a tuna can  Well, I don't know well this guy promised to make people longer and thicker and stuff and and he pretty much just made  frankenpeckers all over the tri-state area 
[171:30]
 There's a couple examples a 37 year old Long Island contractor was left with scarring that causes penis to twist painfully and led to  hospitalization for infections look like a crawler  To corkscrew a 44 year old Long Island landlord endures daily therapy  Which in which he hangs weights from his penis to break up scar tissue left by multiple operations  That's great. Oh a 46 year old security guard has to use a pump to achieve erection and takes 
[172:00]
 Psychiatric medication to help him control the rage he feels for Schwartz  Oh  This guy on the line had the surgery Charlie, what's up?  Yo, what's up man? Listen now my dad had done about a month ago. Your dad had his penis enlarged 
[172:30]
 Yeah, they think I'm purple. They said I stick this big syringe thing in the tip of it  Are you serious?  So much trouble don't even bother  Wait Charlie, you sound like you're for real your dad really had the surgery to get a thicker or longer  Longer longer and thicker actually damn it around. Why would he why would he get that done? I don't know  And he told you that he had the only  Really 
[173:00]
 Terrible oh my god  We kind of knew it you ass this guy do get this dad  He recalled this guy calling Schwartz to complain about pain and being told don't worry about it  Be a man about the pain, but the pain didn't go away his testicles turned black  And he could not achieve a full erection. Oh  My god, so there are people that are that want to kill this guy. Yeah. Oh 
[173:30]
 I remember when this guy first came out. He looks familiar. He was like doing the talk show circuits  Saying that he can make  Make guys penises bigger now. Oh my god  imagine you  things twisting on you  Another guy his penis had  It shrunk  Immediately after surgery the man thought the pain was excessive especially when he urinated and most frightening his penis had shrunk 
[174:00]
 It had retracted inside my body he said it didn't come out anymore  I had to sit on the toilet like a girl and when I touched it I felt nothing no pleasure no pain  He returned to Schwartz for corrective surgery that resulted in some improvement in appearance  His penis was slightly less retracted, but not in sensation or sexual function guy was just done  Why would you do that?  Doesn't unless I swear unless every time you pull your pants down the girl just laughs uncontrollably and you're like what the hell I'll take 
[174:30]
 Yeah, I'll take the chance because it doesn't matter at this point  Wow, yeah, this surgery is just  Gotta be happy with yourself. All right, great  What's the daily news doing a whole thing on doctors like this? Yeah, Katie, what's up?  Yeah, I was talking about 
[175:00]
 You don't need to get the penis enlargement surgery  Why what because the girl can actually work it from the bottom not enough that actually extra part will come out  during effect I  Don't even know if that just made the radio you're Katie you're trying to say that  Through a technique you could just get the penis longer  Right, you know  What do you do just squeeze real hard down?  You don't squeeze you massage and you rub it and you kind of like use your two fingers on the side 
[175:30]
 between the your the man  stack and  roughly and gently that extra inch will actually  Come out if you will round it enough you have to you have to around it  It's not something that will the penis will do by itself. Oh  Okay terrific  All right  There's a book in the video available on it on how to do this without the man having to go through surgery 
[176:00]
 Okay, did you really need it that much longer?  No, not at all. But some guys, you know once in a while  They want to try something different and they want to feel good about themselves. Don't you ladies agree?  You don't need to hit the you know, the back wall as long as you're hitting the sides. You're all right  Absolutely. That's what I thought  But I'm just saying for guys who want this if they want to give it a try if they're not happy with it  If they can talk to their me it does work. All right. Well, thank you Katie. Thank you  It brings up a memory it I went out with a girl that had like a deformed 
[176:30]
 badge  And and when we had sex I would hit the back wall yeah  Swear to you really? Yeah, she that it was the most bizarre thing man. I would just pound the back wall  Felt like a black guy. Yeah  It called the cervix. I'll be thank you Mike. What's up into it? Hey  Hey, what's up? I want to talk to that chick 
[177:00]
 Katie yeah, why?  Well, she's right man. I miss her about seven. Yeah, and you know  I mean this I was like a couple of two inches tucked underneath  Then you could get to make your thing longer  Yeah, I mean you just when you work at it and everything, you know  Field that you were  That's great  You got come on. You never done that. No, I never liked I don't understand what you guys are doing 
[177:30]
 You just push harder. That's all  All of a sudden. I mean does it really need to be that much longer? I don't get it  Why would you want your thing longer? No now it's it's not a it's not a sexual  Procedure you go see a doctor for it. I mean when you're doing it, you know, I mean when you masturbate whatever  It's probably only seven inches. But if you want to do it, I'm like, oh you won't believe it 
[178:00]
 No, I believe yeah bang hard man. All right. Yeah. Well, thank you. Thank you. Yeah  Sorry, I didn't mean to hang up on you go ahead what's going on? Hey guys, how you doing? Good. What's up?  Hey, my wife is a nurse and she had this patient who was like a 70 some odd year old guy  Yeah, and he had that pump thing put into his schween  Oh really and she was there when the doctor first came in to demonstrate how this thing works  And basically it said there's a little thing that hangs out of your leg that you have to pump 
[178:30]
 Yeah, and you pump it up. But when you're done with it, you have to bend it to deflate it  Oh  My god  I was laughing my butt off when she told me this story like trying to get air out of a balloon and stuff  I clearly had a bend it so it's a fleet. Right?  Is that really how that works? Yeah, I got to keep all me into me. She's a nurse at a hospital  At that point why bother? I  Mean, I guess he'll be like the hit of the nursing home pretty soon 
[179:00]
 So where where's like the thing where he has to pump it up  She said it was like coming out of like one of his legs down like on the inside of your thigh  Yeah, but how far down? Well, I guess like middle or so  She really didn't get that specific but she went down and she told all the other nurses she worked with and they were all  Cracking up about it. Yeah  All right.
