<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-recorded intro from Jon Stewart mocking the hosts.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of the Yankees' poor spring training, quickly segueing into their "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" (WOW) segment, encouraging female listeners to flash other drivers.  Anthony recounted a dull Knicks game he attended, noting the presence of Star Jones and Phoebe Cates, which sparked a lengthy, sexually explicit fantasy about Phoebe Cates from *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*.  This transitioned into a critique of MTV and VH1 programming, followed by further celebrity gossip.  Several listeners called in with their own successful WOW experiences.  The hosts promoted Stacker 2 weight-loss supplement.  A humorous news story about President Clinton's amazement at a screensaver led to speculation about his computer habits. The presidential election was discussed, focusing on the candidates' appearances and the supposed state of the White House mattress; Rockaway Bedding was promoted.  Upcoming guests Brian Regan and Louis Black were mentioned.  Throughout this segment, the hosts engaged in frequent vulgar and sexually explicit jokes.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to a phone call with Andrew Dice Clay.  Listeners had overwhelmingly criticized Dice's recent pay-per-view special as a "train wreck," comparing it unfavorably to amateur pornography.  Dice’s call was rambling, offensive, and sexually explicit, filled with crude jokes and insults targeting various public figures (McCain, Hillary Clinton, Bush, Gore, Katie Couric), including homophobic and racist slurs.  He promoted his act, claiming it was “topical,” and introduced a new routine involving offensive greeting cards. Numerous interruptions from callers occurred, some further criticizing Dice's pay-per-view special, others contributing to the overall vulgarity. Dice frequently claimed to be having a heart attack.  The conversation touched on the Knicks, Yankees, politics, and the upcoming WOW segment.  A caller mentioned Dice's rhinestone-encrusted jacket. Club Soda Kenny, Dice's associate, also called in, escalating the chaos.  Paisano’s restaurant and WOW were promoted.

The next segment featured many more WOW caller experiences.  Alan detailed a strip club encounter where women only approached him after his girlfriend left. Marianne, a dancer from Mulcahy's, was briefly interviewed.  Numerous callers described their WOW experiences, including JC and Jeff Norris.  One caller shared a story about a 16-year-old attempting the "Jay Moore move" (exposing himself and asking "What are we going to do about this?"), which resulted in a slap.  Sports updates, including Boomer Esiason's firing from ABC and Opie's childhood altercation with him, were interspersed.  The news segment covered a mass diarrhea outbreak in a Jamaican prison (attributed to spicy crab soup), a prankster selling a girl's virginity online, and monkeys stoning a herdsman to death in Kenya—all treated comically.  A substantial conversation with their former boss, Scott Herman, reminisced about their time working together and contrasted Herman’s past stressful role with his current relaxed state.  More WOW calls followed, along with a discussion about the attractiveness of Derek Jeter and Mike Piazza.  The Yankees' preseason performance and the players' physiques were humorously debated.  NYToday.com and an auction for backstage passes to an upcoming Opie and Anthony Roadshow were promoted. More WOW calls and Big East Tournament discussions concluded this section.

A caller named Benji engaged in sexually suggestive and crude conversations, including a recounting of a sexual encounter with a primate.  This transitioned to Anthony’s struggles with the flight simulator game F-18, prompting many calls with advice and gaming anecdotes.  The conversation shifted to a Daily News series profiling the 15 most sued doctors in New York, focusing on a doctor specializing in penis enlargement surgeries.  Callers shared graphic anecdotes about their experiences with the surgeries and the doctor's practices.  A "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featured humorous (and often crude and offensive) observations and insights from the show’s topics, including references to various pop culture figures and events. The show concluded with more listener calls, banter, and a final listener's assessment of the hosts; future guest Louis Black was mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie's worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying star here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman show.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, I'm Jon Stewart, and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  These guys have problems, but you know that.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't fix you.  That is too fun.  Please stop.  1027 W. 
[00:00:30]  WNEW.  WNEW.  Huh? 
[00:01:00]  Huh?  Uh?  I look for the macho us.  Huh?  This man wants to be a macho macho man.  Hey.  I have this kind of body.  Always in demand.  Okay, terrific.  This is in the morning.  Okay.  Wah.  Hey.  Hey.  Huh?  Hey.  Hey.  He's a macho man.  Hey.  Let him jump down with anyone he can.  Hey.  Hey.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:01:30]  All right. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  Hey, hey.  Okay, terrific.  Hey.  Yeah.  We're rocking. 
[00:02:30]  You never hear enough village people out there.  Oh, yeah, hasn't it?  Yeah.  It's the O&A show.  Any guy he can.  All right.  Lick my bones.  Well, what's up, Anthony? 
[00:03:00]  Hey, man.  It's the O&A show.  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony.  Beautiful day.  It's unbelievable.  It had that spring smell, didn't it, when you went outside?  Oh, that's what I was smelling out there.  Oh, yeah.  I thought I was smelling.  No, it is great out.  Spring fever has hit, Anthony.  Beautiful.  You can feel it in the air.  People driving around with their windows down, maybe.  Sunroof open. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm thinking we should preview Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today.  A little preview of the Wow-Wage?  A little preview of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday?  It is a little early in the season.  It's early, but we have a lot of brand new listeners, Anthony.  They don't know what Whip-Em-Out Wednesday is all about.  It's like the preseason.  It's a preseason, kind of like the Yankees.  Sure.  How they're messing up things down there in Florida.  Better than preseason Yankees have been doing.  I love that, though, how the papers print that, too. 
[00:04:00]  You know, the Yankees have been having a little bit of a time there preseason.  But 0-5.  It's like preseason.  It's not about winning, though.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  And people are like, uh-oh, is this spelling a bad year for the Yankees?  If I'm not mistaken, I think they did the same thing last year.  Yeah, don't worry.  I think they had a really crappy spring.  Don't have to worry about it.  Spring training.  We just all got to pray for Daryl.  Oh, he's getting pissed, man.  Yeah, I know.  Steinbrenner walked out of a preseason game?  Relax. 
[00:04:30]  I think this is the year where he finally loses it.  He finally goes back to the George we remember from the 70s.  This year, George Steinbrenner will fire Joe Torrey.  Thank you.  Really?  Wow.  Bold statement from the opster.  Thank you.  It's been way too long.  I don't want him to fire Joe Torrey.  I think he would be stupid to fire Joe Torrey, but I think this is the year that George goes  back to being the mean bastard that we all know and love.  I'm going to cut him out of the Yankees like they cut your colon out. 
[00:05:00]  Hey!  I just had that feeling in my gut today, Anthony, that the old George is coming back this year.  Yeah?  You know, all of a sudden the Yankees start off a little slow.  I don't think he has it in him anymore.  I don't think he has it in him anymore.  To fire anyone?  Well, not to fire anyone.  Just to be that ball buster that he used to be.  Yeah.  We'll see.  It's preseason.  Relax.  Jesus Christ.  I've got to say hi to everyone.  I saw at the Knick game last night at the Garden. 
[00:05:30]  Did anybody comment on your faggy pink hat?  Well, that's why I have to say hi to everyone that came by and said hi and said,  Wow, Anthony was right.  Your hat is not pink.  Thank you very much.  It's a red hat.  It's a red hat, yes.  Very pink.  Man, it was the earliest I've ever left a professional basketball game,  and you know how much I love hoops.  Very boring.  I left late in the third quarter, Anthony.  Now, why?  To catch the 931 back home.  But what was the problem with the game?  Well, when you're at the Garden, you know, you have to make some decisions. 
[00:06:00]  It's like, hmm, should I make the 931 train home, or should I wait until the 1002?  Right.  And the game wasn't going anywhere.  They were up by 20 or so at that point.  I'm like, you know what?  This is boring.  Up by 20?  Yeah.  So I guess they won.  No, they kicked serious ass.  The team looked great.  Yeah.  But, I mean, but it was Vancouver, man.  Vancouver, it seemed like they were playing an exhibition game last night. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Like, Vancouver has got to be the most boring team in the NBA.  No standout stars.  It just sucked.  You could just feel it in the place.  Even though the Knicks were playing great and kicking their ass,  it was like there was no energy in that.  Yeah.  In the Garden last night.  Huh.  So I'm like, screw this.  I'm going home.  Wow.  So I took the early train home last night.  Were you sitting in the seats we usually sit in?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because I think we had the game on for a couple of minutes in the office,  and I think we saw you. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Not a joke.  All right, here's the joke.  No, I swear, it wasn't a joke.  It was the hat.  It was the hat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because on TV, it turned up a little pink.  Shut up.  I'm just saying.  I'm serious.  You're such a dick.  It's no joke.  What a douche.  At least I go to sporting events and stuff.  I went to the Knicks game with you last time.  And support the team and things like that.  Oh, support the team.  Like the Knicks care if you're there.  No, I don't.  You know what I mean.  As long as big, fat Star Jones is on the sideline and Spike. 
[00:07:30]  That's all they care about.  The celebrities.  Star Jones was there.  Was she?  Spike was there.  No Tom Brokaw last night.  No Woody Allen.  She's one of those big, fat, like, Knick groupies.  She goes to every game?  I'm convinced.  Every game I've been to, she's been there, yes.  Some people like that.  Like, Star.  I'm convinced she just wants to be seen there.  I think that's part of it.  Another part of it is it's a reason for her to talk to men. 
[00:08:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, if she goes to the Knick game, she could start a conversation.  You know, oh, how about them Knicks?  Oh, I was at the game last night.  Me, big, fat, Star Jones was there.  I'm a lawyer, you know.  But, like, I think it just gives her something to talk about.  You know?  Like, oh, she's there at every game.  Mm-hmm.  Right on the sideline.  Well, she's in the front row.  Quartz side.  You know, those quartz side seats are just unbelievably expensive, Anthony.  This is a great game.  More chicken wings. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, that was a good shot.  Right in my mouth.  I'm not talking about the game.  I'm talking about the guy throwing chicken wings at me.  You know, people work their whole lives to try to get really good seats.  Yeah.  When you're going for season tickets, you know the deal, right?  Sure.  Very hard.  Can you imagine after, like, you know, years and years, you finally get, like, court side seats at the garden, and you have to sit next to Star Jones?  Oh.  Because the seats in the garden to begin with are so freaking next to each other.  It's very ridiculous.  Yeah.  They kind of squeeze as many asses in there as possible. 
[00:09:00]  Then you've got Star Jones' thigh on your leg as you're trying to sit down and watch the Knicks.  She's, like, moving all over trying to see the game.  Yeah.  I've got to see that game.  Right.  Where the ball?  Let me let the guy on this side of the car.  Meanwhile, you know, you've got the big, flabby, holiday ham arm, like, bashing in the face.  Oh.  But I'm a diva, so it's okay.  Take all that money for those seats.  Ooh, that's tasty.  What is that?  Oh, a basketball?  I ate the basketball.  Look at that.  Hey, can't even tell. 
[00:09:30]  Can't even tell.  Pay all that money for those seats, and you only get to use a corner of them?  Yeah.  Gee, thanks.  Because Star Jones' big, giant, hippo calf and thigh is right brushed up against your leg.  Ooh, that's good.  What is that?  That's a unique flavor.  What is that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's your arm.  I seem to have taken a bite out of your forearm.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  I like having a little...  Sometimes I like eating a little Chinese here at the game.  Oh, I just ate soup and eat. 
[00:10:00]  Sorry, Woody.  Woody couldn't be bothered.  He wasn't there last night.  Do you know who was there?  Oh.  I spent half the game checking out one of my favorite actresses of all time.  Uh-oh.  And I didn't know she was either married or just hanging with...  With a dude.  With Kevin Kline.  Kevin Kline.  Let me see.  Phoebe Cates.  Are they married?  Yeah.  Ha.  Does she look good?  Ha.  Oh, yeah?  She was going through a phase.  She hasn't aged a bit, Anthony. 
[00:10:30]  She's sitting there with Kevin Kline, and I'm staring at her the whole damn time.  Really?  Ha.  Where was she sitting?  You know where Brokaw sits?  Yeah.  Kind of like...  Why couldn't I be there if she's Phoebe Cates?  You know, I spanked out of bats, just like Judge Reinhold did in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Ha.  Yes.  I love that one.  Phoebe Cates.  Phoebe Cates, yeah.  Remember that scene where Phoebe comes out of the swimming pool? 
[00:11:00]  I always feel a little bit of a movie.  Wait, Tom, let me get the music for you so we can take you right back.  I like to make believe it's me.  All right, here we go.  Spanking out of bats in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  Here she comes.  Yeah.  Oh.  There it is, Lil.  She dives in the pool.  Swims up to the ladder. 
[00:11:30]  Now she climbs out of the pool slowly, misting water behind her, and she unbuckles her brassiere and opening up between those lovely Phoebe Cates' boobs and says,  Tom, you know I've always wanted you.  Tom, you know I've always wanted you.  Doesn't anybody freaking knock anymore?  Those guys are fags. 
[00:12:00]  And then we're going to wick on over London and jam with the stones.  Awesome.  Totally awesome.  But isn't this our time, Mr. Hand? 
[00:12:30]  Righteous bucks.  Hey, a nice jacket.  I love those dudes.  When it comes to making out, always remember, side one will load Zeppelin four.  That's right, you're very good, Tom. 
[00:13:00]  Tom Rugga, I'm a big fan of Fast Side of the Ridgemont High.  Yeah.  That was great.  I can fix it.  I've got an awesome set of tools.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Now I'm banging Jennifer Jason Leigh in the pool cabana.  She's only 17, but look at those saggy boobs.  What's up with her?  She's naked in every move.  She was naked in every move.  You're right there.  She's looking very bad in every movie.  She's naked.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  But, uh, TVK is coming out of the pool.  We all remember that scene.  I remember leaving a little, little bash on the bottom of the NBC News Desk after I saw  the screen.  It was like, myself a little woozy, a little lightheaded.  In Big Tom's head and a little Tom.  Hey!  Tom, big, big Fast Times fan.  Oh, wow.  Phoebe, wow. 
[00:14:00]  You saw it.  And she looks, come on.  Phoebe looks just as good.  Just as good.  So freaking hot last night.  Just as good.  I was dying.  I can't, I can't accept that.  I was dying.  I was making believe like, uh, there was a fly hitting the side of my face so I could  turn my head real fast and do the look, you know?  Because you can't check out chicks when you're with your chick.  Yeah.  That always stinks.  So you've got to make excuses why you're looking elsewhere instead of checking out Patrick  Ewing down low in the paint.  I thought you could use some help with your math homework on such a hot day. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, Rat, would you get that out of the hamper?  You forgot the cheap trick.  I'm always all right.  Daddy's all right.  You just seem a little weird.  The dream police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, but Phoebe hanging with Kevin Kline.  Yeah.  Well, they've been married for a while.  I did not know that. 
[00:15:00]  I assumed Kevin Kline was gay.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I blow that assumption.  They've been married long enough where it isn't really a beard.  I thought he was into Tom Selleck.  Well, they did kiss in that movie.  Oh, boy, did they.  Jesus.  I don't know.  There was a mouth kiss on an SNL I saw the other day.  I saw that.  Did you see that one?  That was pretty funny.  Well, that was a funny bit.  Yeah.  On the airplane, spanking each other. 
[00:15:30]  All right, listen.  A couple of the guys kissed.  A couple of the guys, remember?  Well, it was Will Farrell.  Yeah.  Well.  And Chris Katane, right?  I might have enjoyed it.  Right.  And then I was watching some of the old SNLs on Comedy Central.  Mm-hmm.  And it's so funny to see Jay Moore popping up on those things, because I swear, they gave  him the smallest parts ever.  He did nothing.  I mean, you thought Brewer barely showed up on those shows.  Jay Moore's on screen long enough to just go, Jay, what's with the effing hair?  He had some wings going or something. 
[00:16:00]  It was pretty funny.  He was one of the guys on the buh-bye sketch.  Buh-bye.  Buh-bye.  And they just usher him out of the plane.  You know, buh-bye.  You've got to remember all this next time Jay Moore calls in.  Yeah.  We've got to abuse him.  Hound him a little bit.  Well, we're going to talk about Whip Him Out Wednesday, but we went off on some classic  O&A tangents there.  Always off on a tear.  Yeah, we want to preview Whip Him Out Wednesday today, so we're encouraging the ladies of  the Opie and Anthony show to flash your fellow commuters on the way home today. 
[00:16:30]  It's just a preview, Anthony.  Yeah, the nice weather.  It's a good way to get it started.  By the time April hits, this thing is going to be huge.  Huge.  We're going to have brand new stickers and all that, but I mean, this is a great opportunity.  It's too nice out today not to do something about it.  So, ladies, we do encourage you to flash your commuters today, okay?  Absolutely.  On the way home.  And guys, if you see anything out there, please let us know, okay? 
[00:17:00]  Right.  We'll go to the phones next.  212-757-1027.  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd object a little intelligence to this conversation here.  Yeah, there's no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  All right, Anthony, Mountain Dew.  Yes.  Mountain Dew.  Mountain Dew, yes, Anthony, Mountain Dew.  I love Mountain Dew.  Oh, yeah, Mountain Dew.  Remember drinking it when I was a kid?  No, I drink it now. 
[00:17:30]  Good thirst quencher.  We got a hell of a deal working with Mountain Dew, don't we, Opie?  Uh-huh.  Why don't you tell them about it?  Oh, I thought you were going to tell them about it today.  No, this is basketball.  This is your thing.  The only thing I have to say is, go Iona.  That's right, Anthony picking Iona to go all the way in the NCAA tournament.  I'm betting on the retard factor.  No, we got a great deal.  A great deal.  A great thing going with Mountain Dew, the NCAA, and the Opie and Anthony show, of course.  Yes.  We are going to send one of our fine, fine listeners to the Final Four to check it out for yourself. 
[00:18:00]  Nice.  This is what's going to happen, okay?  We're going to have all the teams, all 64 teams on the WNAW website, obviously looking for the college basketball fans out there, okay?  You go to the WNAW website when all the teams are announced, which is going to be, what, Monday, I think?  Yep.  I think Monday we'll start that, okay?  And then you have to decide, Anthony.  Yes.  Who's going to be in the Final Four?  And then we are going to pick a winner.  Now, what happens if, like, 20 people guess, you know, the Final Four teams? 
[00:18:30]  Winners will be picked by random drawing.  Thank you, Anthony.  I'm sure.  That's usually the way it's worked, if you have people that have picked the same teams.  All right.  So, if you want to go to the Final Four on us and Mountain Dew, starting Monday, go to WNAW.com.  You'll see where to go, and you pick the Final Four teams.  You'll register, and then we'll pick a winner, and it might be you, okay?  We know.  All right, so do the Dew with Mountain Dew and listen to us to win a trip to the Final Four.  Mountain Dew.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:19:00]  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1027-WNAW.  Who'd that be?  That's lovely.  Who'd that be?  That's all we get to that.  It wasn't queued up.  Oh.  And we love Godsmack.  Come on.  Give it to me.  There we go. 
[00:19:30]  Godsmack, Moon Baby.  One of my favorite albums of the past couple of years at this point, Anthony.  What's your favorite album of the last couple of years, Anthony?  Last couple of years?  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Because, I mean, you could easily say Kid Rock for the last year, possibly.  But if you go back a few years, which one of your favorite albums of the last few years?  That's a tough question.  Maybe Rob Zombie's solo effort, Anthony?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Dragula.  Huh?  Which one?  No Doubt.  Yeah, the new No Doubt album, Opie. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah?  That's moving up the Anthony chart.  No.  The Anthony rock chart?  No, I would say I really like the Rob Zombie.  Yeah, that was a really good album.  Yeah.  I don't have to really think about it.  Godsmack, this thing, it rocks from beginning to end.  I think I'm boycotting them, though.  Why are you boycotting Godsmack?  Well, they punked out.  Don't come to the show or nothing. 
[00:20:30]  I know.  And them guys are huge friends of ours on the station up in Boston.  Came on the show.  Had a great relationship with them.  And then they sell a few billion freaking records, and that's it.  They forget they're friends, right?  Well, they...  I think K-Rock's got them scared.  Yeah, well, that's fine and dandy, but you know something?  See, let me tell...  It don't matter.  Let me tell all our listeners something that is the truth.  Ant and I know more about music than any jock at K-Rock and any jock at MTV. 
[00:21:00]  Simple as that.  Hey, wait a minute.  You know, Kane, come on.  Kane knows more than us, I doubt it.  He's on VH1.  He's got to know a lot.  Well, I guess we're really not allowed to have rock acts on here.  Mm-mm.  Because, I mean, we've tried.  It upsets them over there.  It upsets K-Rock, because if we take their rock acts, then what else do they got over there?  Not much.  You know, the tide has completely changed with VH1 and MTV.  Like, VH1's becoming cooler. 
[00:21:30]  You know, when you used to...  Yeah, like years ago...  I hate to admit that, but the videos I want to see are on VH1.  Years ago, you used to say, God, if I start watching VH1 and thinking it's better than MTV, it's going to mean I'm getting old.  Mm-hmm.  And that's not quite the truth anymore.  It just means that MTV is really blowing, you know, what do you want us to do?  Listen to it, Britney, and Instinct, or you know what I saw last night on VH1?  Henry Rollins. 
[00:22:00]  Get out of here.  Rollins band.  On VH1, I was dying.  Doing what, Liar?  No, like one of the new songs.  New album.  Really?  Yeah.  It kicked ass.  Henry Rollins, Liar, is such a great thing.  I know.  It was good with Rollins band.  What in his brain popped when he sung that song?  Liar!  I started laughing as I'm watching it, because I'm just thinking of the Beavis and Budhead episode.  It's like, who do you think would win in a fight, Danzig or Henry Rollins?  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  I'd have to give it to Danzig.  You know, and they have this total argument going on.  You know, Rollins is pretty big there.  You're a dumbass.  I'd miss Beavis and Budhead.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, yeah, so Henry Rollins is on VH1, and you switch over to MTV, and you have  98 degrees.  Mm-hmm.  Holy mother of pearl.  What the hell is going on?  They're catering to the teeny boppers.  Or another, like, Britney Spears lookalike. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Know how many Britney Spears lookalikes there are now?  Christina Aguilera.  Then they got, I don't even know all the names of that one.  Jennifer Simpson, I think, is one of them.  Yeah.  And Mandy something, I think.  Yeah, they're pumping them out like the boy bands.  You know, there's a bunch of carbon copies of those.  No one will ever beat Britney and her breast implants, though.  The breast is always the best.  All the other ones need the breast implants.  Yeah.  Unless somebody's willing to get breast implants at, like, 12.  And start singing to really get the publicity going.  Now, that'd be interesting. 
[00:23:30]  That would be very interesting.  But, yeah, now they're running off carbon copies.  And then you got Carson, who I know has to hate the image that he is getting.  He's getting all, you see him on TV Guide and all these magazines.  And it's like, oh, all the girls love Carson.  He's just, oh, he's great.  He's like a teeny bopper idol.  You know, they love him.  And, you know, he wants credibility.  He wants music credibility.  And it's killing him. 
[00:24:00]  It's killing him.  Well, because he used to do a cool radio show out there in L.A.  Now he's the teeny bopper guy who is getting lumped in with instinct and 98 degrees from all the girls that love all that.  They're putting his pictures up on the walls.  It's got to kill him.  The backdoor boys.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the last thing I think he wants.  He's the Dick Clark of our era.  Ah, good.  He is, though.  You know something?  You just got to open up the MTV yearbooks. 
[00:24:30]  Take a look back and please don't be too full of yourself.  There's plenty.  Remember J.J. Jackson?  J.J.  I liked Alan Hunter.  Martha Quinn.  Alan Hunter.  Alan Hunter was my favorite.  What?  Jay Moore was a VJ?  Jay Moore was a VJ?  I don't know.  Another question to ask him when he calls us again.  He might have had VD at some point.  I don't know if he was ever a VJ.  Hey, Sam, what's going on?  Oh, I just got to let you guys know you guys rock, okay? 
[00:25:00]  Why?  I just had an awesome incident.  I work in the military.  Yeah.  I just came back from Fort Mama.  Yeah.  On 18 on the way back, we're thinking, yeah, why not?  Let's write something on a piece of paper.  Wow, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure enough, these two girls right past us, we didn't think nothing of it.  We just decided to give it a shot.  My friend whips out this wild sign, sticks it on the window.  The girl starts laughing.  Sure enough, I've seen a lot, and this one will be one of the most memorable scenes.  They just took everything off, and they just made our day. 
[00:25:30]  I just got to let you guys know.  Keep up the good work.  Oh, cool, man.  What road did that happen on, Sam?  It just happened right on AT.  All right.  Well, thank you.  All right.  All right, man.  Woo.  They're very happy, Anthony.  We are previewing.  Yes, they are.  We are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today, because we can't help it.  The weather's way too good out there.  So, ladies, we're encouraging you to flash your fellow commuters today, please, just to  give our new listeners a sample of what they can expect all summer long here on the  Opie and Anthony Show.  Right, Anthony?  Right. 
[00:26:00]  Basically, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, you put Wow in your car, and then the ladies,  know that you want to see something.  Wow, somewhere on the car.  It could be written on the dirt and the big doors of your tractor trailer.  It could be on the back window of your car.  Yeah.  A little bumper sticker thing or something just written.  Bag of Wow chips has been working great for the guys that have their wives or girlfriends  that don't want them putting Wow in the car.  Mm-hmm.  You get those Wow chips and shove it in the, like, by the rear window.  All of a sudden, you've got a Wow in your car.  Your wife is like, pissed at you? 
[00:26:30]  You go, oh, I forgot the bag of chips back there.  And we're only going to preview it, because we know winter's going to kick us in the ass  one last time.  It always does, every year.  Yeah.  And then we'll break out Wow for good, probably in early April, I'm assuming.  Very good.  Right?  Yes.  But today, we are encouraging the ladies.  We're going to push it today.  We're going to push it.  Yeah.  Ladies, flash your fellow commuters if you feel like it.  Wow-wich.  Give them a taste of what, you know, the Opie and Anthony show is all about, all right?  Taste.  A taste.  All right, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Oh. 
[00:27:00]  Wow it on train.  Wow it on the parkway.  Wow.  A lot of people checking in already, Anthony.  It's happening.  Nice.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  And I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie, Anthony, 1027-WNEW.  Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes, it works.  It does work, Anthony.  And you might need it. 
[00:27:30]  What have you been doing?  You've been eating.  You've been hibernating for the winter.  Well, sip like a squirrel.  You've been storing your nuts.  And now that we're getting a sample of spring today, Anthony, you know it's in the back  of your head, oh my God, I've got to lose some of this weight before the warm weather  hits for good.  What happened?  I didn't have a bunt when I put my coat on.  Now all of a sudden you've got to burn that bunt.  Burn that bunt.  How are you going to do it?  With the world's strongest bunt burner.  Yeah, we want to talk to the girl that heard about stacker two from our show and lost over 
[00:28:00]  100 pounds.  Is she too scared to contact us?  Come on.  Because there's a pre-recorded commercial that's running when we're not on the air where this  girl brags about how she lost 106 pounds on stacker two.  She heard about it on our show.  Yeah.  And she basically wants to give us Hummers.  Really?  Yeah.  She's so ecstatic.  We changed her life, Anthony, with this stuff.  You know what's amazing?  The station itself, N.E.W., took a stacker and lost about 300 pounds of fat. 
[00:28:30]  300?  Try a couple tons.  It's just called Tom Likens.  He's not 300.  Oh, come on.  It's about 180.  Really?  185.  He carries it like three.  Maybe it's the mongoloid hair, too.  All right.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  It does the three things.  It burns the fat.  It crushes the cravings in between meals.  And it gives you a boost of energy when you're petering out late in the day.  Okay?  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Give them a call.  1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. 
[00:29:00]  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  It's as long as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and that is my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie and Anthony.  What a couple of ass wipes.  What a couple of ass wipes.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  A couple of ass wipes.  There you go.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:29:30]  That's us.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, Pat, what's going on today?  Hey, how are you doing?  Real good.  Is this Pat?  Huh?  Who is this Pat?  Opie and Anthony, we're live on the air.  Let's go.  Hey, yeah, I'm on a trip bike.  Exit 13.  Okay.  I'm a truck driver.  I listen to you guys all the time.  I just got wowed by a couple of chicks in a red car.  There you go.  Hey, whip it out Wednesday.  You guys are great.  We're previewing whip them out Wednesday today because we can't help ourselves.  It's so nice out.  So, well, congratulations to you, sir.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys. 
[00:30:00]  All right, guys.  You guys are great.  Take care now.  All right.  All right.  Definitely encouraging the ladies to flash their fellow commuters on the way home today.  Yeah.  As we give you a preview of what the spring and summer is going to be like on the Opie and  Anthony show.  Just one of the many things, okay?  You want to talk about Clinton real fast?  This is great.  I guess we could start doing new material.  Been on an hour and a half at some point.  Oh, my God.  All right, I'll read this one.  Clinton finds screensaver amazing. 
[00:30:30]  I love this.  This is the leader of the free world, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  President Clinton, who likes to play up his fascination with computers while playing down  his experience, was dazzled on Tuesday by a basic display of software, a screensaver.  A screensaver.  He was amazed by a screensaver, ladies and gentlemen.  There's a quote in here by Clinton saying, amazing. 
[00:31:00]  Amazing.  He said, Clinton said, as watching a series of coffee cups, deer, and a blackboard form  and dissolve on a monitor during a visit to a computing class in a senior citizen center.  Wow.  Amazing.  Look at that.  Look, it's like pipes, and they're just making themselves go, and I don't know where they're  going, and then they disappear.  Amazing.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  By a screensaver. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  This just goes to show you that these jerk-offs have the speechwriters and everything, and  they're publicity people, and they make their speeches about the Internet.  He's been talking Internet and everything, like he knows what he's talking about, computers.  Guy doesn't have a clue.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  A screensaver.  Amazing.  Not by the Sims or some of the great computer games out there.  No.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  Right.  Oh, my God.  The low-key visit with about 30 participants in the class also got Clinton talking about 
[00:32:00]  computer games he used to play with his daughter, Chelsea.  They were Freddy's Rescue Roundup and the Carmen Sandiego series of educational games,  Anthony.  Just no porno.  I'd punch up the pornography, like cigars and stuff.  I like that.  Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?  I played that one with Chelsea.  And Hillary played, where in the world is Bill's penis? 
[00:32:30]  She wasn't really doing very well at that game right up until about a year ago.  Then she won.  I love it.  I'm playing some new games.  Womb Raider.  Womb Raider, huh?  Gash Life.  New one.  First-person load shooter, they call it.  And it also says Clinton does not use his office email that much, Anthony.  Oh, what would he be doing? 
[00:33:00]  I'm 15.  How old are you?  Clinton in the chat rooms.  That could be pretty funny.  Good.  AOL's chubby chick chat room.  I like this one.  Do you like cigars?  All right.  How much do you weigh?  Would you like to intern for me, the president?  That is ridiculous.  Clinton finds screensaver.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Like magic.  Look at that.  And I turn the monitor around, and I don't see how they get those pictures in there. 
[00:33:30]  I'm amazed by the whole thing.  Look, there's a picture of fire on the monitor, but I don't feel any warm.  How they do that?  Amazing.  Yeah, suck it.  Go ahead.  I'm amazed by the screen.  Suck it.  Oh, boy.  You find these things out toward the end of any administration.  The guy at the helm is a stark, raving lunatic.  Yeah, they've run out of things to talk about, Anthony. 
[00:34:00]  It's his voice, and now they've got to dig deep, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he wasn't really paying attention to the computer on the monitor when Monica's ass was up there.  You know?  I didn't really look at the screen set when I was looking a big brown eye.  That's amazing.  Amazing.  Look at that big old brown eye.  That's amazing.  All right, Mr. Clayton.  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  I was wondering what that was, a computer.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  What does it do? 
[00:34:30]  What does that even do?  Suck it.  I got the brown eye screen saver.  It's amazing.  Opens and closes.  It's great.  Amazing.  Amazing screen saver.  Holy God.  Oh, you almost cursed there.  Oh, my God.  I'm amazed that he's amazed.  Even Reagan would probably, yes, I know about screen savers.  They don't amaze me.  They amaze Clinton.  Mr. 20th century, 21st century. 
[00:35:00]  Didn't Gore invent the Internet?  Oh, that's what he should know about.  That's what he claims.  Yes, Anthony.  I want to know something.  Did Clinton and Gore speak at all during eight years together as president and vice president?  Have you ever seen him in the same room?  They don't talk to each other.  Shaking hands.  That's great.  No.  These guys didn't say word, one, not boo to each other.  Eight years.  I don't even think they knew each other.  And Al Gore invented the Internet.  Al Gore is my vice president.  I'm amazing.  That's amazing. 
[00:35:30]  I didn't even know what is a vice president.  Who are they kidding?  They're keeping Clinton as far away from Gore as possible.  Well, Gore is trying to become president.  Yeah.  And to have Clinton in there, those ads are coming.  It's coming, though, Anthony.  Oh, you know.  Now that we know it's going to be Bush and Gore, I mean, let's face facts here.  Bradley, what, he's dropping out tomorrow and he's going to endorse Gore.  Gore, yeah.  Yeah, and Bush obviously just pretty much killing McCain at this point. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, McCain, he had a little rally there for a little while.  It was kind of cute, you know.  Oh, look at the vet.  He's there, you know, to get behind him and everything.  But then it fell apart.  He just doesn't have the support.  But I think it all comes down to cash, too, and looks, which is an awful thing because  the best guy for the job might not be the most attractive guy.  The best guy for the job is Bradley, but he looks like a slob, in my opinion.  Bush looks like a president.  He looks like what people expect their president to look like. 
[00:36:30]  You could picture, you know, him as president.  Yeah, he looks like his dad.  Younger version of his dad.  Very good.  Get in the office.  Hey, son, can I maybe come in and sit in my old seat?  Maybe put my finger back on the button?  Does, if Bush becomes president, does he sleep in the same bed his parents were stooping in?  Oh, White House.  Oh, my God.  You know, 1-800-TRY-A-BETT.  Yeah, you know he's going to want to redo that room when he gets in there.  Yeah, Rockaway Bedding.  He's going to need Rockaway Bedding.  You don't want the old stained Bush mattress laying out on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
[00:37:00]  That's got to be two big dents where Barbara Bush's fat ass is, like, embedded in the bed.  You don't want that.  That's got to suck, though.  You become president, let's just assume.  Yeah.  And then you see the room where your parents were, you know, having sex, and that's your room.  That's now your room.  That's now your room.  Yeah, clown your own thing.  You know what the thing is, though, who knows, who really knows if that bed is still even in there. 
[00:37:30]  I'm sure the Clintons have been through a mattress as good, but I've got to tell you,  if I was George W. Bush, who I would think would probably be the next president, just saying,  he gets into office, the first thing I do, day one after the inauguration, you move into the White House,  I would get the most stained, disgusting, decrepit mattress and just carry it out to the curb  and leave it out there and just, like, big stacks of porno mags and just pile it up by the driveway  for the garbage man. 
[00:38:00]  Would that be hysterical?  A couple boxes of cigars.  Cigars.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Old condoms and stuff.  Just, like, lay all that crap right on the curb.  Goddamn, would that be killer.  We should do that.  Yeah.  That's our bid, man.  Let's do that Clinton moving day giveaway.  Yes.  The stained mattress.  Oh, man.  A Clinton garage sale.  Take it away.  I have no need for this anymore.  Let's do a Clinton garage sale.  Clinton garage sale.  We'll broadcast live in front of the White House.  There's a park right in front of the White House there. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  We'll broadcast from the park.  We'll do that.  Clinton's moving out.  And the savings are passed on to you.  This old stained mattress.  Some cigars.  Some blue stained dresses.  Very good.  Amanda, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's everything?  Good.  I was watching MSNBC last night waiting for the results to come in for the primaries.  Wait a minute.  Can I stop you there?  Sure.  Why did you have to tune in yesterday and wait for the results? 
[00:39:00]  Why?  I have to know now.  No, I knew before Super Tuesday that it was all over.  I was a McCain supporter, and I just wanted to see how he'd be pulled out.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Why were you backing him?  I was back just because I liked him.  He was, like, different, refreshing for the Republican Party.  I liked his shoulders.  Well, anyway, they had strategically placed Maria Shriver in the hallway waiting for McCain  to come in to make his kiss.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  And he said, like, he snapped her. 
[00:39:30]  He's like, get out of here.  And she got, like, all bent out of shape.  But how else is this man supposed to act?  He just, like...  You know how he's supposed to act?  He's supposed to act not like a sore loser and presidential, or at least presidential contender-ish.  Because he walked by her, and she was asking him, you know, how do you feel?  How do you feel?  You know, prodding him and hounding him like reporters do.  And he turned around and said something like, get away from me.  Yeah.  Ah, get off.  Yeah.  Get away from me.  I think it was very normal, though.  It was very enjoyable.  Yeah! 
[00:40:00]  Get away!  You whore!  He's got it in him to snap, Amanda.  That's why we wanted him to be president, so he would snap in the Oval Office there.  Well, he had a little bit of a preview last night.  It was really funny, because then whoever, was it, Brian, whoever the heck his name is  on MSNBC, he's like, well, you heard it here.  Get out of here.  Like, it was so ridiculous.  Get out of here.  It was pretty funny.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Who are you going for now that McCain's pretty much out of it? 
[00:40:30]  Are you going to...  Oh, all right.  Well, she would probably go for Bush.  That's what I would assume.  Darren, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  How are you?  How amazed is Bill Clinton about DNA?  DNA.  I can't believe they found me.  I'm amazed.  How'd they find out that was my splooge?  I'm amazed.  Well, there you have it.  Yeah, there you have it.  The president amazed at a screensaver.  That's something.  You know something? 
[00:41:00]  I've got to admit, I was pretty amazed when I went from, like, my Commodore 64, my Atari  800, with my cassette load drive.  Sure.  You used to have games on cassette tapes.  I remember that.  And it was a cassette load.  You used to have to type in C-load.  C-load.  Or cassette load.  So when the computers really...  I got my first Mac, and, you know, you see the screensaver on it, and the graphics  are so sharp, and it's pretty cool.  It's moving.  It doesn't look like that pixelated crap you used to get on Atari and Commodore. 
[00:41:30]  Or, I've got to say, I was amazed.  I was amazed.  Well, that's something to be amazed about.  It was also 1983.  I know, right?  How can you be amazed at it?  It's the year 2000.  How can you be amazed at a screensaver?  I'm amazed.  You know what else?  Get this.  You should have a screensaver of Monica giving him a Hummer or something.  I took this TV dinner, right?  I put it in this thing that I like to call the cooking box in the White House. 
[00:42:00]  Pushed a button or two.  It made these amazing beeping noises.  And you know something?  In three minutes, that came out hot.  They called that a microwave oven.  Amazing.  Normally, it would take maybe 20 minutes to thaw and cook that Schwanson TV dinner.  Three minutes, I was amazed.  I ate the whole thing in front of my screensaver.  Are you amazed at beepers, too?  What the hell is that? 
[00:42:30]  You don't know what a beeper is?  No.  Explain.  You can have your girlfriend beep you?  Whoa.  You mean a little thing that beeps when she's calling you?  Yeah.  I am amazed.  Jesus.  All right.  God damn.  There he is.  The president that was talking about leading us into the 21st century.  Amazed by the screensaver.  God damn.  Not amazed by MP3 files or... 
[00:43:00]  No.  Or voodoo graphics.  Something called a Bic lighter.  And you move your thumb and there's fire.  No more banging rocks.  I am amazed.  All right.  Let's take a break, huh?  Amazing.  Having lots of fun today.  Let's not forget, we are previewing Whip Em Out Wednesday today.  Ladies, we're encouraging you to flash your fellow commuters on the way home today to give them a little, you know, taste of what's going to happen in the spring and summer, okay?

Can you imagine what had happened if she ever showed him what the vibrate function on a  pager was like?  I would be amazed.  Yeah, we're learning today that the president was amazed at a screensaver.  Screensaver. 
[00:50:30]  Now, what does it do to save a screen?  We must all unite to save the screens.  Like the whales needed our protection in the rainforest.

But there's a little video game, and it's called, it was at www.comeonmonica.com.  Oh, yeah.  Have you checked that out?  Yeah, we've seen that.

[00:51:30]  And it's like you see the hand on the Johnson, and it's like moving back, like you're cocking  a gun.  Wow, but yes, it's a very funny little game on the Internet.  He could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he had just played that, and that would  have been just as amazing.  Well, guess who they modeled that penis after?  It's a game.  Come on.  Yeah, save the screens now.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Save the screens.  Bye.  That is a very funny little Internet game to check out. 
[00:52:00]  Hours are fun.  Hours are fun.  Maybe play it for, what, I don't know, two minutes.  Yeah, all right.  Then they're like, what else can I find online?  All right, rest the points.  Hey, Belinda, what's going on?  Hey, who is this, O or is this A?  Both.  It's O and A.  Oh, hey, guys.  How are you?  I'm very depressed right now because nobody's noticing me.  Why?  What do you mean?  Well, I'm sitting here in a pretty busy shopping center.  Right outside is like a McDonald's.  I listen to you guys all the time, and it was really going to be nice today, so I purposely 
[00:52:30]  didn't even wear a bra.  I purposely wore this, like, shirt that kind of has, like, a bra built into it.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting here lifting up my shirt, and nobody's even noticing me.  Wow.  How ugly are you?  I don't think I'm that ugly.  They're not noticing?  How big are your boobs?  Like 36Ds.  All right, you have 36Ds.  You're in a shopping center.  You've been flashing, and people aren't noticing?  No.  There seems to be a problem.  Well, not with me. 
[00:53:00]  Do you smell?  Do you have tinted windows?  No.  My name is not that girl, Karen, who has a video problem.  Oh, my goodness.  Who's coming in later this week to get sponged down.  Yeah.  I know.  Do you have cranky ass?  Excuse me?  Cranky ass?  Cranky ass.  I have happy ass.  Happy ass.  Happy ass.  You don't want cranky ass.  I have, like, a bubble butt, like a Jennifer Lopez butt.  Oh, big ass.  No, it's nice.  It's shapely.  It's very firm because I squat.  See, as I...  It's your squat.  I like girls that squat.  As Cowbell Bill says, if you pop the nugget and then go for a long walk, you'll get cranky ass. 
[00:53:30]  My ass is happy.  You know, it's like you had to really force out that last milk, Doug.  And then you take a long walk, you're going to get cranky ass.  Where is Cowbell Bill?  Javiel.  Javiel.  Javiel.  He comes up with the best stuff.  Why did she hang up?  We were going to give her some advice.  Ah, she might have gotten...  Maybe that's what she had.  Ah.  You think she might not...  Oh, my God.  I have cranky butt. 
[00:54:00]  You think she has that cranky ass?  Cranky ass.  Well, she's got to call back.  We were going to have her wow live on the show.  We'll get people to notice her.  Sometimes you don't know that little milk dud is still dangling.  And you get up.  Anything over about a quarter mile and you got cranky ass.  Javiel.  He comes up with the best stuff, man.  I'm telling you.  He's insane.  He's in Florida.  We're going to have to...  He's still in Florida?  He's down there for like a month golfing. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know what the hell this guy does.  Nice life.  He just makes jokes all day.  JB, what's going on?  I just got wowed.  Hey, congratulations.  Bravo.  Leaving the golf course, a chick wowed you.  Oh, I believe you said leaving the golf course, a chick wowed you.  Honest to God's truth.  Right in the parking lot.  Where were you?  Hillsboro, New Jersey.  All right.  There you go.  Nice.  And they look like Mae Young. 
[00:55:00]  Ah.  Bad news.  I'm hated for life, guys.  Even a bad set's a good set, JB.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  A syndication months ago.  All right.  Thank you, JB.  Later.  Bye.  Preview and whip them out Wednesday today for our fine listeners, Anthony.  Sure.  Cranky ass.  Cranky ass.  You don't want cranky ass.  Got to make sure you clean up.  Get every little nugget out. 
[00:55:30]  Another mess of a show in progress.  What else did you expect today?  Oh, please.  Hey, we talked politics a little bit today, right?  Sure we did.  A little bit.  We talked about the Knicks and the Yankees a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit there.  We don't go right to the gutter, but we always end up there.  We always end up there.  That's right.  Oh, brother.  All right.  I think we have to take another break.  You want me to go to one of these?  A lot of few calls coming in about Dice.  I don't know what that's all about. 
[00:56:00]  Well, we'll get into that next.  I was wondering, because did he have a pay-per-view?  Dice on pay-per-view last night?  Was that a brand new one?  Why wouldn't he?  Why wouldn't he call and come on the show so we could promote his pay-per-view?  Does he think he's so big that he could still sell out huge pay-per-views without maybe a friend or two talking about it?  Maybe he doesn't like us anymore already.  What did we do?  Listen to us.  You figure it out.  Come on.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  We'll maybe talk to Dice next.  Then more of your phone calls.  212-757-1027.  OB.  What is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  OB.  And Anthony, you just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  107-WNEW.  Oh. 
[00:57:00]  Groovy.  A little retro.  Lots of instant feedback coming in, Anthony.  Lou from Jersey writes,  Okay, terrific.  Almost got me fired today.  Thank God the boss is a fan.  Kept playing it over the intercom.  And he came in and said,  Okay, terrific.  Do it again.  You're fired, ass.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:57:30]  Sweeping the tri-state area.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  But you've got to know when to use the okay, terrific.  You can't just use it.  No.  Right, Anthony?  Well, the best place, I guess, is the same place like Butthead used to just make that face  where he would stare into the screen and not say anything.  But his face was like,  his mouth open.  Like, what?  Horrified.  Yeah.  I'll give you one.  What?  Hey, Anthony, I got cranky ass today. 
[00:58:00]  Okay, terrific.  Well, it works, right?  That would work, right?  And you try one.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Let's see.  Hey, you ever have your girl put on a strap on and do you?  Okay, terrific.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:58:30]  Ah, yes.  All right, let's go to Jimmy.  See what this pay-per-view is all about.  Jimmy, what's up, man?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Not much.  Oh, I happened to be flipping through the channel last night,  and I saw his face on TV.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  I'm not watching.  You're talking to Dice Man.  Huh?  Yeah, I saw the Dice Man.  I couldn't believe it.  It was like a train wreck, man.  A train wreck.  It was his pay-per-view from last year? 
[00:59:00]  It was a pay-per-view.  I don't know.  It looked like it was from Vegas or something.  It looked like someone was shooting it with a camcorder.  Oh, my God.  It was so bad.  Really?  It was so bad.  Why would they play an old Dice pay-per-view?  I don't know.  It looked recent because he was fatter.  You know, he looked all out of shape and, like, you know, his face.  He looked older.  But I don't know.  At one point, this guy got so desperate.  He had to lay down on stage and start humping the stage or something like some girl was taking  in the balloon out of time.  Hey, that's funny stuff, Jerko face. 
[00:59:30]  Huh?  What's the matter?  You paid for it, didn't you?  Hey, I didn't pay for it.  Did you pay for it, farmer?  I didn't pay for it.  I didn't pay for it.  Well, you got an illegal box?  I got the scam-per-view.  Hey, could you send me five bucks if you enjoyed it?  Huh?  Oh, well.  I can't help you, man.  Well, we're trying to get him back on the show, but we can't find him lately.  Well, listen, back in the day, I got, you know, I got to give the guy his props.  Back in the day, he was funny. 
[01:00:00]  You got to admit that.  The guy was probably the biggest thing that ever hit comedy for a short a period of time.  Yeah, he skyrocketed.  I think that's what ruined him, though.  And came down just as fast.  I'm still there.  I'm still there.  I sell out the garden, the Olive Garden over there in Times Square.  Yeah.  Okay, Jimmy, thank you.  No problem.  Anytime.  Let's see what Charlie can add to this.  Charlie, you saw the Dice pay-per-view, huh?  Yeah, I think Anthony should do Dice because he does it better than Dice does Dice. 
[01:00:30]  You just pay Anthony to go on pay-per-view.  Anthony doesn't do Dice.  Dice is really here.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, when you hear the Dice voice.  What's wrong with you?  I'm funny at your show.  You got a problem?  Yeah, you're funny you're on O&A than you're on your pay-per-view show.  Hey, take-off face.  Huh?  I'm still relevant.  It's all topical.  What's a little bit of stuff there, Dice?  I got some new stuff.  Yeah, tell me something new.  Hey, you see this McCain?  Yeah.  They're trying to be elected.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Wait a minute.  That's all you got on McCain?  Well, he's goofy.  Did you see his shoulders?  Yeah, we see his shoulders.  They're all crunched up.  He goes, oh, I want to be president.  Oh!  See, I do political commentary.  They're doing topical.  It's topical.  They're doing topical stuff.  Sure.  Do you know where Hillary wants to be senator?  Yeah, senator of this fine state of our...  Oh!  What?  Whore!  Whore, that's all you say?  Fat whore!  See, I throw the fat in. 
[01:01:30]  That's funny.  Come on, topical.  Oh!  You're cutting edge, Dice.  Cutting edge, farmer!  Anything on Bush or Gore?  Hey, Bush!  He's got a name like a gash!  Oh!  That's all you got on.  See, it's topical!  Bush is, hey!  And what about Gore?  Al Gore!  Yeah.  Oh!  He's a stick figure!  Hey, I was with this chick the other night. 
[01:02:00]  She goes, oh, I think Gore's sexy.  I said suck my...  Oh!  Can't understand why you're not filling arenas with this topical,  uh, edgy stuff, Dice.  Hey, I can't do this show no more.  I'm dying over here.  No, I'm serious.  I gotta leave.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  I'm dying over here. 
[01:02:30]  Wait, Dice, someone wants to talk about your rhinestones during the TV show.  John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Hey, Dice.  Yeah?  That, uh, rhinestones on your jacket was screwing up my TV.  You had so many on there.  Yeah, I got my bedazzler, and I wrote Diceman rules.  A dice?  And it sparkles.  I mean, you can't get a big of your personal.  I mean, you can't get a big of your personal.  A dice?  I'm dying over here. 
[01:03:00]  Dice, have you seen the back of your jacket recently?  Well, last time I saw it, it says Dice rules.  Well...  Okay?  Dice's cool face.  Well, now it says Dice is a dork on the back of your jacket.  You better...  Let me look at the back of the jacket.  You better take it off and take a look.  Who's that?  Club Soda Kenny?  Would it be dance?  Look.  You're bringing the funny man.  I'd love to stay, but look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  Look, I'm dying over here.  I'm making a guy gonna give you a personal. 
[01:03:30]  We're hoping for more examples of your topical humor.  You got anything on...  Yeah, but I'm dying over here.  You've been dying for a while, man.  Listen.  Topical humor?  Yeah, you got anything on...  All right, let me rip in the noose.  I'll give you something.  Give me your subject.  I'll show you.  I'm just as good as Seinfeld.  All right.  At who?  Top of my head here, Katie Couric and her little examination on the Today Show.  Oh, you see, she got the anal exam.  Yeah, the pipe, yes. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, you see, you get the pipe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, what's up with that?  Huh?  I'm dying over here.  Look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  Hey, you see her ass?  Uh, yes.  Yeah.  We all saw her.  I said, Katie, you know, what's with the ass on TV?  She goes, oh, dice.  Hey, so I did her.  See, this is good stuff here. 
[01:04:30]  This is going to get you right on top again.  You want to go through the paper and riff a little more there, Dice?  Look, I think I'm dying over here.  Yeah, I'll riff on the paper.  Okay.  You see the stock market yesterday?  Uh, yeah.  It plunged 374 points.  I had a chick.  She plunged on me.  Hey, gee, gee, gee.  See, that's topical.  I'm just riffing on the noose.  Okay.  I'll write another story.  What do we got here?  Hey, gee, gee. 
[01:05:00]  Would you like me to give you one, maybe?  Yeah, I can't read.  I just figured this out.  Hey, you know what I found out?  Huh?  These screensavers are amazing.  I ain't never seen one.  All of a sudden, the computer's making pictures.  I'm like, hey, gee, gee.  Well, people are calling in with reviews of your show last night, Dice.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's going on?  How's it going, ONA?  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing, Rob? 
[01:05:30]  Whatever the hell your name is, Jacob?  All right.  I checked out your pay-per-view last night.  Yeah, thank you.  Hey, funny stuff, right?  Yeah, it sucked.  I mean.  Hey, what are you talking about?  It looked like you shot.  It looks like I've seen amateur porn that looks better than that.  Yeah, which you might have read it.  See, I came back out of there.  Hey, good callback.  You like that?  Yeah, very good, Dice.  I was watching ten minutes into it.  I turned on Friends.  It was friggin' terrible.  He's a crack.  Dice, he turned you off for Friends.  Hey, you see that show Friends?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  What's with that Chandler?  What kind of name is Chandler?  Oh!  That's all you got on one of the hottest shows of our time?  Hey, I don't feel too good.  Look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  I'm dying over here.  All right, listen, why don't you talk about Hillary's new hairdo?  Hey, you see Hillary's new hairdo?  That's a big story here in New York as she makes her Senate run.  A little makeover for Hillary.  So she had the hair on top of her head done.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Oh!  Wait a minute.  Hello!  You can't say that.  Hey, did you have to dump out?  Yeah, we had to dump out.  Hey, they're screaming on the phones.  Wow, let's see if they heard that on the phones.  Uh, Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I saw the Dice thing last night.  The guy sucked.  I think that, you know...  Like your mother sucks, Jack.  Hey, Jack, what's your last name?  Ass?  Jack Gaze.  Look, I put two words together, and I make them look like a Jack Gaze. 
[01:07:00]  Ow!  Hey, Dice, I think it said kick me on the back of your jacket.  I think they got the B-Dazzler, and they put that kick me in my fat ass.  Hey, let's see you do a pay-per-view, Jack Gaze, okay?  Let's see you.  Hey, Dice, can you say anything other than Jack Gaze?  Yeah.  Ass Jack.  You're an ass jack.  See, I can turn it around.  Hey, why are you hanging up on our listeners, Dice? 
[01:07:30]  I don't want to talk to him.  Why?  Because he's a jackass.  What, is he getting the best of you or something?  No one gets the best of the Dice, man.  Let's go to Tim.  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  The Dice's show was a new one Friday night.  It was on Friday.  A new one?  Yeah, it was on last night.  Hey, shut up and let me talk.  So you were laughing, right?  Yeah, I was laughing.  You thought it was hysterical?  Yeah, second time around.  What was that supposed to mean, Jack Gaze? 
[01:08:00]  What are you, Dice now, Kirsten?  He said that for it, Opie.  You gotta be, you gotta be on the button.  Like the Dice man.  I'm up today.  Look, Cotty Lee leaving the show.  Yeah.  You ever see her?  With the cane sagging.  Yeah, she doesn't wear a bra.  Oh!  That's all you got on that.  Well, she's the gig.  Give me a little cut.  I'll get you a punch and lull. 
[01:08:30]  Ho!  And Regis, what is the millionaire show?  Yeah, who wants to be a millionaire?  Who wants to be?  The thing I got millions of dollars  for when I sold out like the guard?  Yeah.  Oh!  Put me in the hot seat.  I'm dying over here.  Who wants to be a washed-up comic?  Is that the name of your new show?  Hey, Farmer.  Yeah.  Hey, how about Cardinal O'Connor?  How about him?  He's going to be retiring soon. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, he looks like a marshmallow with a big hat.  Come on, that's funny.  That's almost there, sure.  I surprised myself.  I'm laughing at that one.  A marshmallow with a big hat.  All right, well.  Oh, marshmallow with a big hat on me.  Right, listen.  Hey, see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah.  He looks like a big melted marshmallow.  See, now I changed it up a bit.  I'm topical.  Hey!  You're riffing.  John has a short poem for you.  John?  Hey, O.P.  Hey there, Dice.  Hey.  Hey, John.  Okay?  Roses are red, violets are blue. 
[01:09:30]  No one under 18 has ever heard of you.  Hey, can I use that?  Oh, sure.  I'm putting that in the ad.  All right, thank you, John.  Hey, John.  Bye.  Say this.  I'm dying over here.  Hey, John.  John.  You see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah.  He looks like a melted marshmallow with a pulp hat.  Uh, that's kind of funny.  I guess.  Wow, John. 
[01:10:00]  Dice is working it here.  You can laugh at at least one of his jokes.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  I'll give you half a heart.  Uh, TK from Long Island.  Dice should get the pipe to see if there's any remnants of his career in there.  I'm still hot.  Look, they did a pay-per-view.  Yeah.  I think someone in pay-per-view screwed up and put the wrong reel on.  What was that, the outtakes?  Supposed to be Steel Magnolias or something. 
[01:10:30]  This guy says you look like the Fonz on your pay-per-view.  Oh, man.  I'll tell you.  Hey, the Fonz is cool.  No, it looks like a 60-year-old Fonzie.  With a sequins jacket.  The same old cigarettes.  Stupid thing.  It's over.  See, I do the thing where I come out on stage and I light a cigarette.  I'm telling you, you should take Fonz's place.  Hey, sit on it, Ponce.  Okay?  Sit on it.  Hey!  So you look like the Fonz now, huh?  That's what I'm going for. 
[01:11:00]  Like a cross between the Fonz and Vinnie Barbarino.  With a cigarette.  Up your nose with a rubber hose.  Hey!  Gunning him in my office.  Oh!  See, I'm going for the Fonz thing.  I still come out on the stage.  Yeah.  I look all cool.  Oh, yeah.  I light a cigarette.  Oh, sure.  And then I have a heart attack.  I have to go.  I'm in your gag and I get you to the personnel.  Can you say that?  Take off.  I'm in your gag and I get you to the personnel. 
[01:11:30]  I'm dying.  Sean, what's going on?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Good.  That pay-per-view is going to be on again tomorrow night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, everyone...  It's new.  It's called pay-per-view.  It stinks.  Okay?  In your kitchen with a rubber lizard.  Yeah, huh?  Jekyll.  Can I use that?  Hey, you see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah, you did the Cardinal O'Connor joke.  It's a new one.  It is?  Yeah.  Okay.  It looks like a pillow with a crow pad on. 
[01:12:00]  It's topical.  Did you see HBO as if these walls could talk?  Oh, they got to do with the dykes.  Yeah, you must have some good material on that.  Yeah, Ellen DeGeneres, right?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  She chews a rug.  Right.  Oh!  That's all you get.  Oh!  Sharon Stone.  Yeah.  With the, uh...  She's got, like, cans.  Yeah, she does.  And Ellen was playing with them.  Yeah, she was.  Oh!  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:30]  I'm dying, over there.  I know you are.  Make you happy to person out.  All right, we'll take one more call for you, Dice, okay?  Anthony, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Dice.  Yeah.  You are done.  Hey, thank you.  You are so done.  Is that a new hip term the kids are using?  Done?  That means like you're hot, right?  Like fat?  Be handsome.  When people say, hey, Dice, you're fat, that means good, right?  So I'm done.  What was that deal with those cards you wrote last night? 
[01:13:00]  He had these cards.  Oh, that's the new act.  I got it.  See, instead of rhymes, I'm doing greeting cards.  You couldn't even read it.  Yeah, let me do one.  You could...  Uh, this one would be for a chick for Valentine's Day.  It says, Happy Valentine's Day, you freaking whore.  See, that's funny, right?  Look, you're laughing.  Here's another one.  A personal Christmas card for Christmas.  Merry Christmas, you freaking whore.  See? 
[01:13:30]  And then I got authorization one on a birthday.  Happy birthday, you fat bitch.  Hey, see, this is funny.  It's a new twist on the rhymes.  Uh, Dice, we got the Olive Garden on the line.  They want to, uh...  I'm dying over here.  They want to book you.  Is the Olive Garden on the line?  Yeah, Dice, how you doing?  Hey, this isn't exactly the garden I'm looking for.  Yeah, this is Mike from the Olive Garden, Dice.  What's going on?  What can I do for you, Jake-off?  I want to know if you can sell out a table of five.  Table of five? 
[01:14:00]  I got some hospitality, I know.  Yeah, I saw you the other day at, uh, laughter.  You crapped your pants in Hallentown, Pennsylvania.  Yeah, and then I'm playing at, uh, at Shake Your Balls Loose, and, uh, ha-has, and the comedy toilet.  Oh!  Ha-ha, I just left.  My career's rolling.  All right, Olive Garden, thank you.  All right.  And finally, Jack.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I think Dice, I have a great idea for Dice, you know, how it can improve his act.  Yeah?  I say, I say you put a cigarette in your ass, just on stage. 
[01:14:30]  All right, I'm still with him, don't laugh.  If this will get the career back, I mean, you're going to get your personality.  Yeah, by the way, I figured out what that means.  I've got to be cooking the person out.  Yeah.  I think you're having a stroke, you freaking fat loser.  I could be.  Look, I'm tired over here.  Smoke another cigarette, you fat loser.  Do you have a greeting card for this guy, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I know it's your birthday and you want the case, but not until you show me your case. 
[01:15:00]  All right?  I got a greeting card for Dice.  Yeah.  My deepest sympathy on the loss of your pathetic career, you fat sow.  Hey, can I use that?  Jack.  The only original thing.  Hey, your name's Jack?  Jack off.  Look, I got him, right?  I nailed you.  I nailed you when you know it.  Your name's Jack.  I called you Jack off.  Look.  Oh, I got you.  I got a good one.  What are you, a chink?  Are you a chink?  Look, I'm racist now.  Hey, hey, chink. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, Jack.  Hey, hey, those are the only people your act is funny to.  They don't understand you.  Hey, Jack.  Jack off.  Look, I'm still banging you.  Hey, hey, I got a new one for you.  Off Jack.  Hey, hey, that's good.  I like this guy.  You want to come to Vegas with me?  You can open up and make a tag and give you the personality.  Hey, yeah, I'll take you.  I'm dying over here.  I'll take you to Vegas.  You can be my sideshow freak. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, Jack off.  Jack.  Hi, Jack.  I'm going to use the cigarette in the ass.  No, I like that.  Yeah, that's the only way you'd be entertaining, you fat loser.  Hey, what are you hanging up on him for, Dice?  I don't want to talk to nobody that's going to be railing me.  Hey, I got some more cards.  All right.  Here's one for Mother's Day.  Okay.

Hey, hey, how about you see my aunt when I go, Chinese, how could you give them keys to a car?  You could blindfold these people with dental force, okay?  Hey, didn't we drop a couple of bombs on these people?  Wait, Dice, I thought you were trying to do the Seinfeld thing.  Not the racist thing. 
[01:21:00]  Andrew Dice Seinfeld.  Yeah, I thought you were doing a little Seinfeld.  What's with these airplanes?  What's with the peanuts?  Always with the peanuts.  Huh?  How about these airplanes?  Dice, do you...  With the peanuts.  I mean, I'm going to give you a personal.  Dice, do you have maybe a tender greeting card that you're working on?  Hey, Kramer, suck my hog, okay?  Maybe a tender greeting card.  Tender moments?  Yeah.  Maybe a little softer.  So for like Valentine's Day?

I'm going to give you a bit of a personal.  Okay.  What does it mean when it feels like an ice pick's going through your temple? 
[01:22:00]  Because I think I'm dying over here.  I got this feeling, and my eyes are like going back and forth.  But with that...  In my head, like a whore.  Yeah.  But that doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't, does it, bud?  I'm going to give you a personal.  You want to take a break, Dice?  Pharma.  Want to take a break?  Yeah, you need a break from the comedy styling, don't you?  Boy, dude.  You can only take so much comedy in one sitting.  Whore.  This was much funnier than the pay-per-view.

You're funny.  All right, listen.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy, Anthony.  We love Paisano.  I believe tonight would be a great night to head on down to Paisano of Mulberry Street. 
[01:24:00]  Nice little spring night happening today.  Yeah.  I wonder if they're going to be putting the tables out yet.  Probably not yet.  Probably not yet.  But, man, when the warm weather does hit for good, it's just a great atmosphere down there.  You've got the tables on the sidewalk.  It's a great place to eat.  And people watch.  And the staff of Paisano treats you right.  The food's great.  The price is reasonable.  Huge portions.  Huge portions.  And pretty much somebody associated with this radio show down there.  Almost, almost every night of the week.  Check out their wall of celebrities. 
[01:24:30]  They have a bunch of pictures of all the celebrities.  And for some reason, we're up there, too.  I don't understand that one.  Well, yeah.  But, yeah, you'll love Paisano.  We do.  Ask for Joey when you're down there, the owner.  And you get a glass of wine on the house.  Father Joey.  Father Joey.  What?  Is he a priest now?  Father Joey.  Father Joey.  Is he going to be wearing the collar and everything?  He's got a daughter now.  Christine Nicole.  Hey, can I play down there?  What do you mean, Dice?  I need a gig.  You want to do a little 15-minute act while people are eating some linguine? 
[01:25:00]  I'll play Paisano.  Yeah?  Huh?  You'll love Paisano.  You will.  See, I'm topical.  Yeah.  Go to Paisano, Mulberry Street.  Say hi to Joey.  Congratulate Joey on the birth of his daughter.  And also tell him that Opie and Anthony sent you, and he'll give you a glass of wine on the house.  All right?  Dice.  Paisano, Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  A lot of people want the number for reservations.  Call 965-1188.  That's 965-1188. 
[01:25:30]  We have the number here at the studio.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Go to Paisano.  Eat a breadstick.  Oh!  See, I could kill down there.  All right.  It's Paisano, Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd like to do that.  This is debauchery mania.  I'd like to do that.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I'd like to do that.  1-1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:26:00]  What's this?  Another one bites the dust.  I still laugh at that commercial that uses another one bites the dust with the guy driving the hearse.  Yeah.  He's making all his faces at the cars.  Bye-bye.  It's not what this is, is it?  It's like, no, no.  Our phone line, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Is this taken from Songs from the Glory Hole? 
[01:26:30]  What the hell is this?  Fax line, 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  Oh, no, no, no.  And we are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today, Anthony.  Such a nice spring day.  Nice and warm.  Want to give the newer listeners a taste of what they can expect when Whip-Em-Out Wednesday hits sometime in April.  So we are encouraging the ladies on the way home today to Whip-Em-Out to your fellow commuters, okay? 
[01:27:00]  Absolutely.  All right, let's go back to the phone and see what everyone's talking about here today.  James, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  What's up, Bowen A?  How are you?  I'm doing pretty good.  Yeah, I was driving down, had a hard day's work today, a union iron worker, driving on the yellow.  Whoa, you can't say that at all, Mike.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  All right, so you had a bad day.  I had a bad day at work.  You're in your car.  And a girl in a black jetta lifted up her top and showed me what she had.  And it made your day, right?  It made my day.  Cool. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, and hey.  Yeah.  I want to ask you, how could you vote for Bush when he's all against union workers?  I didn't say that.  Well, I want a McCain.  Yeah, that's what we all wanted.  And I want Bradley.  I know that doesn't make sense, but...  Yeah, because he's trying to get rid of the union workers in Texas.  No one's going to be able to do that.  No one will worry about that.  You don't think?  No, it's like the abortion issue and stuff.  Don't worry about it. 
[01:28:00]  No one's going to outlaw it.  It's not even an issue.  I mean, Bush doesn't blow me away, man.  Bush?  Yeah, not at all.  I mean, none of these guys do.  But Gore?  I mean, oh, please.  Well, at least Al Gore used to be with Clinton, and he had the economy going.  James, Clinton didn't have anything to do with the economy.  Believe me, it was riding a wave.  He just got elected at the right time.  Yeah, the economy was doing well.  It was on an upswing, just as he was being elected, pretty much.  It turned during the election, I believe. 
[01:28:30]  Did Bill Clinton come up with all these new businesses that people started investing huge  amounts of money in?  That's true.  That's true.  He doesn't even know about a screen saver.  Yeah, he thinks a screen saver's amazing.  I don't think Clinton had anything to do with the dot-coms that completely helped our economy.  I tell you, I turned on my computer the other day, and I was amazed by the screen saver.  The screen saver's amazing.  James, I think Al Gore is our next president.  Yeah, let's hope so, man.  Let's hope so.  Al Gore?  I want to feed my kid.  I'm not saying, I'm not, I just think that's what's going to happen.  I'm not, I'm not hoping. 
[01:29:00]  Al Gore, only if his running mate is Bill Clinton.  That's it.  Who's he going to pick?  He might pick Bradley.  You know, that would be pretty cool.  Kind of pull their resources there.  I don't know.  A ball sack.  He might, oh, Bradley?  Bradley's got a scrotum under his chin.  Easy, man.  All right, guys, I just want to tell you, you and I work is erected faster.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  Don't mess with the X and X, Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, sorry.  Don't mess with Dollar Bill.  Dollar Bill Bradley from the corner.  From the corner?  Wow.  Can you name, well, can, why?  Well, you can get me back.  Can you check my basketball?  No, you can get me back, like, talking about cartoons and other things.  I just want to ask you a question.  Okay.  Name two players that Bradley played with on the next.  Don't write it down, Rick.  Okay.  Don't write it down?  On the mix.  Two.  Just two.  Two.  Two.  Two. 
[01:30:00]  Two?  God, ponderous.  I know you could do it, Ed.  Come on.  Two.  Two that Bradley played with.  All right.  Two players that Bradley played with.  See, we're trying to add sports to our show.  Played with.  This would be a good thing to throw out there.  Can you give me the years?  Like 72.  72.  72-ish.  Bradley.  Give or take a year or two.  Okay.  Did he play with Wilt?  Wilt was with Los Angeles, right?  Well, they played during the same era.  Very good.  There was a couple championships there where the Knicks did play the Lakers. 
[01:30:30]  See, I knew he was with the Lakers.  Okay.  Okay.  Let me think.  No, in all seriousness.  I'm thinking.  Because it's funnier if you don't know, but I'm really curious.  Come on, dude.  Bradley.  We need sports on our show.  Help me out there.  I'm thinking.  Basketball isn't all a sports, for the love of God.  It's just funny, because then when Anthony goes off on some cartoon thing, and I'll just  sit there like, uh, oh, yeah, I remember that, Anthony.  Come on, two.  Bradley.  Was it a black guy? 
[01:31:00]  Wait, come on.  One's a current announcer for Knick Basketball.  Oh, that guy.  No, I know who that is.  Okay.  We just saw him the other day.  We were going out the exit.  Don't give him the answer.  It's not fun if you're going to give him the answers.  Is that Huggy Bear?  Yeah, yeah.  The tall guy.  With the sideburns.  And the gray beard now.  He has a little gray. 
[01:31:30]  Come on, Ed.  Wait a minute.  Let me.  What's his name?  F.  G.  I can't remember his name.  Should I give you the initials?  Yeah.  W.  Do you have?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Walt Frazier.  Okay, good.  Okay, I remember that.  Okay, that's one.  Very good.  One more.  Um, I know.  Rick's writing them down.  I know who they are.  The guy with the, uh, that big afro. 
[01:32:00]  It was the 70s, you ass.  What, did he play hoops with Oscar Gamble?  I'm trying to get my, um.  Oscar Gamble, the best afro in sports history.  Um, come on, one more.  Come on, Ed.  I knew what you could do.  I knew what you could do.  I knew what you could do.  You're dead serious, too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm totally serious.  Oh, my God.  The other one is, um, coaches for, oh, that's too obvious, all right?  What?  A coach?  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to know a coach? 
[01:32:30]  He's now a coach.  Hmm.  Um.  One's a GM for, for the Washington Wizards.  Bill Parcells?  Uh, let's see.  Um, uh, I had you with the Bill name, though, right?  It's a Bill.  Bill.  Bill, Phil, whatever.  Phil.  Oh, Phil Jackson.  Very good.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Very good at that.  I done good.  We're going to be doing.  I don't know basketball. 
[01:33:00]  We're going to be doing, uh, sports, uh, on our show, obviously.  Especially old basketball.  Oh, my God.  Well, I grew up watching DeBusher and Bradley.  Dave DeBusher.  See?  I know his first name.  Earl Monroe, when we traded for him.  Oh, sure.  And, uh, Dr. J.  Willis Reed.  Julius Irving.  Jerry Lucas.  What?  Who?  Jerry Lucas.  Jerry Lewis.  Very good with the telecon.  Henry Bibby.  What?  Henry Bibby.  Okay.

Dice don't make a move without Club Soda Kenny.  Hello?  Club Soda Kenny.  Hello, my friends Opening Anthony.  How are you, sir?  Club Soda.  You haven't been listening to the radio today, have you?  I'm actually taking a dump right now. 
[01:34:00]  Spaz had me on hold for so long, I couldn't wait anymore.  So I hope you don't mind.  No, that's okay.  You're spraying mud?  No, no, I'm actually a little constipated, so I've been here a while.  Did you hear Dice on our show today, Club Soda Kenny?  The Dice impression or my real friend?  No, the Dice man.  No, I haven't spoken to him today.  I don't know what's going on with his wife today. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, really?  I thought you were with him all the time.  Not the way you think I am.  No, huh?  No.  Hey, Kenny, you're a jerk-off, okay?  Oh, hi, Anthony.  No, that's not Anthony.

[01:35:30]  It doesn't streak.  Hey, dunce man, it's my turn.  Oh, what?  Now, it's all funny for you to rag at somebody that sounds like Dice?  Because 24 hours a day, I'm up your ass?  No, listen.  I love you guys.  I think you're terrific DJs.  DJs?  We don't play music anymore, can't we?  Well, you know I'm not that bright.  All right.  I'm a little behind in the times.  Well, I mean, you're kind of going to get your personality. 
[01:36:00]  I'm trying to talk.  I mean, you're kind of going to get your personality.  I know you were trying to get me last week, but I couldn't get back to you in time.  All right.  Well, what's the possibility of getting the Dice on our show soon?  Well, you know, I'll talk to him.  You know, he's exclusively playing Las Vegas at the Venetian Hotel.  Yeah.  You know, we're there like one weekend a month.  Okay.  We'll be there at the end of the month, like, you know, April Fool's Day.  Well, what do you want us to do?

I told you he plays exclusively in Las Vegas.  Yeah.  Well, fly us out to Vegas.  No, I could.  Yeah?  You know.  Dice makes enough money, right?  What's in it for me?  He's got to be making royalties off of that cop movie I saw on the hotel TV a couple of months ago.  Dice with Don the Dragon Wilson? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  He's got two new movies coming out soon, too, with Rodney and Michael Douglas.  Rodney's still alive?  Rodney's still alive.  You can't talk about him like that.  He just did.  Kenny, we interviewed him a couple of years ago.  Is he doing better these days?  Hey, I just crept myself, okay?  Huh?  Well, who was that talking?  That was Rodney.  Rodney.  Oh, I didn't recognize the thing. 
[01:37:30]  Kenny, you're pretty good, man.  Hey, I've got to change my depends.  I'm a good personality.  All right.  Pretty king, you're kind of going to use your personnel.  Okay.  Very good.  Your timing was impeccable.  He likes to tell you.  You make me laugh, man.  Kenny, you're funny when Dice ain't around.  I'm very funny all the time.  Yeah.  You know, he's like an inspiration to me.  He's the man.  And he keeps you down.  No, he doesn't.  I don't know.  He treats me very well. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Are you still checking out our show from time to time there, Kenny?  Yeah.  I listen almost on a daily basis for like an hour or so, you know, whenever I'm doing something.  Very good.  Whenever you're constipated, right?  I love you guys.  You know, the whole Jay Moore show was terrific.  Oh, yeah.  He's another friend of mine.  We love Jay.  You know, I was almost thinking of coming to see you when you went to see him.  Uh-huh.  But I didn't.  Well, come by next time, man.  You can come by the studio anytime.  You don't need Dice.

Can't you just pull your face out of Dice's ass and hand him the phone right now?  Come on.  Hey, don't curse.  Don't curse, because I'll start cursing like him.  Oh, yeah.  And you won't be able to bleep me that much.  All right.  Well, Kenny, surprise us and get Dice to call us. 
[01:39:00]  Get Dice in here.  Oh, now that I got the hotline number, I don't have to call Riggs Beeper or stay on the phone  and beg Spaz to put me on the air.  How pathetic is that, huh?

[01:42:30]  How are you, Jimmy?  All right, what's going on?  We're having fun today.  How are you?  This has been some of the best radio I've heard in a long time.  Whoa, look at that.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You want to know something?  You're going to laugh.  Yeah.  Because I was laughing so hard at those greeting cards that Dice gave.  Yeah.  That I didn't make it to the bathroom to leak.  And I'm free-balling right now.  I had to toss my drawers in the can.  You wet himself?  I haven't done that in God knows how long.  I was a little kid.  You made me laugh that hard.  Oh, that's good.  It was good, you know? 
[01:43:00]  But now I've got to go give an S to me.  I've got to go to somebody's house.  I've got to stop and change my jeans.  Because I think I'm one of those sickos that piss themselves, you know?  Did you have the dumb sweats, too?  Huh?  No.  The dumb sweats?  No, huh?  No.  All right, Jimmy.  Well, try to control your bladder.  It's not making me laugh so hard.  All right, man.  Okay.  Bye, Jimmy.  Jimmy, having fun with the show today?  Yeah.  Let's go to Marianne.  I haven't had many ladies on the show today.  Marianne, what's going on?  Hello.  Hi.  I have a problem.  Why do you have a problem? 
[01:43:30]  I know my boyfriend listens to your radio station religiously.  Okay.  And he won't take me to a strip bar.  He will?  Maybe you would convince him.  Why won't he take you to the strip club?  I have no idea.  I'm begging him.  And why do you want to go to the strip club?  Yeah.  Why not?  You want to know what goes on there?  I mean, why are you going?  There's got to be a reason.  I want to go and see the girls.  Maybe you're making a paranoid.  Why, you get turned on by other women?  Well, kind of.  They'll meet girls.  They're attractive. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  And he has a problem with that?  Yeah.  His friends will take me, but my boyfriend won't take me.  So his friends take you to the strip club?  So his friends would take me if he would let me go.  Yeah, sure.  And what does he say when you ask him?  He says no.  No way.  But he has to give you a reason.  I don't know.  He doesn't give you a reason.  He's more or less paranoid, I guess.  Hmm.  Well, he should obviously bring you there.  Especially if it's going to turn you on a little bit. 
[01:44:30]  That's a nice little fantasy to check out, right?  Oh, sexual tension all the way between both of us.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Does he bang you nice or what?  Excuse me?  Does he bang you?  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  Go yourself.  I can't go myself.  I've got to go with my boyfriend so I can go back and have sex with him.  Yeah, but he wants to have sex with the strippers.  Oh, hell no.  No, I'm just kidding.  Of course.  I don't know.  So maybe you can kind of convince him that, you know, 
[01:45:00]  taking a girlfriend to a strip club is a good thing.  Well, if he gives us a call, we'll talk to him about it.  Great.  I think he should bring you, though.  Oh, I think so.  I think you guys would have a great time.  I've kissed a girl already.  I might as well go and see the strip.  You have.  Yes, I have.  How was it?  It was good.  Very good.  All right.  Hold on.  Rich is going to give you some advice.  Maybe not.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Where am I?  Okay, let's go here and here. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, Rich.  Yeah.  You got some advice for Marianne?  Yeah.  Hey, don't go.  Don't go.  I took my wife there.  I took her to the strip clubs, and she left me for another woman.  Whoa.  Hey, heavy.  No, no, no.  I love men.  So did she.  Oh, no.  I need men.  So did she.  So she met a woman.  So, Rich, what happened?  You took her to the strip club, and did she go away with one of the strippers, or that  just sent her down the path? 
[01:46:00]  Well, that just sent her down the path.  Then she started hanging out with women.  Oh, yeah.  Once she gets with the lesbians, that's it, man.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Big time.  Very, how can I say, militant group.  That's going to suck when your lady leaves you for a lady.  Well, it was fun in the beginning, but when they leave you big time, then it does suck.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Rich.  Hey, anytime.  All right.  Bye.  Rich says, don't go.  Let's see what Alan says. 
[01:46:30]  He's not helping.  Hey, Alan.  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  You took your girlfriend to the strip club?  Yeah.  I took her Sunday when I went to Atlantic City.  I took her to a place called the Booby Trap.  Well, that's what they call it.  The Booby Trap?  Yeah.  Great name.  I love strip club names.  They're the best.  Yeah, right?  Okay.  And?  It was all full nudity, and I sat down by the bar, by, you know, where they danced on  the stage, and no girls would come up to me. 
[01:47:00]  But when she left, they came up to me.  So, what, you're one of those guys that wants the girls to come up to you and stuff?  Well, my girlfriend sounded pretty hot for me, like, you know, to be giving those naked  women money and stuff, and I was all thugged out.  I had my hat, my hat to come backwards, and my baggy jeans on.  My girlfriend's like, oh, you look so cool, all thugged out, giving money to these girls.  And meanwhile, I was like, you know, not getting any girls to come up to me.  But when she left, they came up to me.  So, okay, terrific. 
[01:47:30]  Exactly.  All right, Alan.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for adding to this discussion.  All right.  It was awesome.  All right.  All right.  Good luck.  All right.  Bye, Alan.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  I don't know what the hell is he saying.  I have no idea.  Well, Marianne, I think you're on your own.  I was trying to get you some advice, but obviously it's not working, so.  Well, thank you.  And thank you again for letting me, wow, for the first time on stage at Mulcahy's.  Which one were you?  I was the one that was in the back bar. 
[01:48:00]  You pulled the spotlight on me.  I had the yellow shirt on.  Oh, yeah.  You had some fine fun bags.  That would be I.  Yes.  I remember you.  Yeah, that's me.  Yeah, he should definitely bring you to a strip club.  Don't you think so?  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Marianne.  We've got to let you go.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  That went nowhere with her.  So, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  A couple more great stories to get to today.  Diarrhea in Jamaica. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Al Sharpton going to jail.  What happened there?  Poor Al.  Prankster sells a girl's virginity on the web.  And thirsty monkey stone hurts him into death.  Got to be story of the day.  Who the hell is turning their dial now?  Stay there.  We'll be back.  We'll be in Anthony.  Come on.  Those guys are back.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday today.  A little preview of what you can expect later on when WOW hits for good, when the warm weather 
[01:49:00]  is upon us for good, Anthony.  Yes.  We want to give the newer listeners a little taste of what's going on out there.  JC, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you today?  I am doing awesome.  Oh, good.  Listen to this.  I'm up here in Westchester, and it really, WOW hasn't gotten up here that much.  It hardly ever happens.  So, me and my friend are driving up the Conic State Parkway, get up, a whole car load of 
[01:49:30]  like three or four hot chicks are alongside of us.  They have a WOW sign in their car.  We have, it's myself and my friend, we have all over our car, we have them all over.  Two chicks in the backseat, they WOW us.  So, now we're like, we're on top of the world, real hot.  So, they pull alongside of us again, they roll down the window, and they tell us, it's  your turn.  Scream.  So, we're like, we're taken by it. 
[01:50:00]  We're like, what the hell do we do?  And I'm in the passenger seat, so I didn't know what to do.  Did you return the favor or what?  Whipped out the hog.  Whipped out the hog.  Whipped out the hog.  All right.  Just one more quick thing, guys.  Yeah.  You got to let Jay Moore know, what are we going to do about this?  That whole deal?  Yeah.  A friend of mine's little brother was having a problem getting girls to get to the next  level.  How old is this kid?  16.  Uh-oh.  All right.  So, he goes, he confided in me for advice. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  And I decided to pawn off Jay Moore's theory.  So, you gave the Jay Moore advice, which basically is to expose yourself and tell the lady, what  are we going to do about this?  Yeah, she slapped his face.  Wow.  Oh, it doesn't work every time.  It doesn't work every time.  It was so funny, though, because the guys who were listening were trying to keep a straight  face.  Yeah.  So, and the kid took it for real, and he did it, and he came back in a lot of disappointment,  but then we let him in on a little clue.  Well, I was reading a bunch of email from guys that have tried the Jay Moore move, and  it worked quite nicely. 
[01:51:00]  If you find the right girl, I guess.  Yeah, you've got to feel out the situation a little bit, though.  Awesome.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks, JC.  Congratulations on your wow.  Awesome.  Thanks.  All right.  Our buddy Jeff Norris checking in?  Hey, Jeff.  What's going on, man?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Great.  What's up?  What's up, Ant?  Hey.  Oh, man.  Listen to this, guys.  Get a little bummed out.  You know, I didn't get the radio chick gig, but...  Well, you do know you were one of the finalists, right?  Yeah, I do know that.  I wish Chuck the best of luck, you know, but now I've got to keep in Anthony's field and 
[01:51:30]  bust that damn pin so Anthony can relate.  But I treated myself.  I went out.  I bought a Dodge Ram truck, waxed it today.  Don't believe in putting stickers on a new vehicle, but I had to put the O&A sign on,  you know?  Yeah, the wow.  So I'm driving down to Garden State Parkway.  I get beeped at.  I get beeped at.  All of a sudden, I get a double.  The driver flashes her cans.  The car just stands up, and it was W-O-B.  Without beef.  No, come on.  I'm telling you.  Did you push it up against the glass? 
[01:52:00]  It was going nuts.  I wanted to put the car in and be like, wow, gee, he's getting a truck there, huh?  It was nice, man.  Right on, man.  It was cool.  It was cool.  So you guys made the truck, and hopefully we'll get up there to see you soon.  Cool.  This is, yeah, we're doing a preview of wow today.  Anthony's trying to knock down the webcam that is set up in the studio.  Oh, man.  You guys are nuts, man.  I miss you guys, man, but we'll be up soon.  Yeah, come on by and say hi, Jeff, all right?  Definitely.  Keep up the good work.  All right, brother.  See you, fellas.  There he goes, Jeff Norris, a very funny guy.  Go see him when you get a chance.  Brian's next. 
[01:52:30]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  What's up?  Yeah, just a little update in the sports world.  It seems that you guys lasted longer at N.E.W. than Boomer lasted at ABC on Monday Night Football.  Yeah, I just read that.  They're letting him go, huh?  Yeah, it looks that way.  Oh, God, I feel very good.  What was the reason?  How about ratings?  They don't fire them for ratings.  I don't know.  Maybe he wasn't as good as he was supposed to be.  I don't think he was very good at...  Now, is he stepping down, or do they officially fire him? 
[01:53:00]  Well, I think they're going in a different direction, which is a nice way to say we're  letting him go.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks for the news.  Boomer out.  Yeah, well, how did I get on the show today?  What is it?  Spaz isn't picking up the phone today?  Spaz is just kind of walking around.  I don't know.  I don't know what he's doing today.  Yeah, well, that's why I got on, because Spaz didn't pick up the phone.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Breaking news, Anthony.  We had to stop the show to tell everyone that Boomer's out. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, what a shame.  And we didn't get to interview Boomer about the time you and him fought.  My old classmate from back in Timber Point Elementary School in East Islip, way back when.  I believe that was fourth grade, maybe fifth grade, something like that.  I went to school with Boomer.  Elementary school.  We've tried to have him on the show a few times.  Yeah.  To talk about how you broke your arm punching him in the head. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, he won't come on the show.  It's a true story.  I wonder if he'll remember that.  Ah, probably.  Yeah.  The Boomer.  All right, and you want to move on to other things here?  Yeah, there's plenty of stuff in the news today.  Do you want to hear about Al Sharpton?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, a prankster selling a girl's virginity on the web, thirsty monkeys, stoned herdsmen to death, or diarrhea in Jamaica?  Ah, I like the diarrhea story.  That's pretty funny.  Diarrhea in Jamaica. 
[01:54:30]  Okay.  Let me see that.  All right, let me read a little bit of this for our listeners here.  Diarrhea, wave, hits prisons, supper blame.  In Kingston, Jamaica.  Jamaican prison.  Jamaican prison.  That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh?  And all the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper.  A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than 1,000 convicts suffering. 
[01:55:00]  Doctors are struggling.  I think, ah, frantically, to contain the outbreak, which inmates have blamed on their Sunday supper.  The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering.  Yeah.  Uh, spicy crab, spicy crab soup.  Spicy crab soup.  Chinese cabbage.  Chakotai.  It's Chinese cabbage.  Uh, rice, peas, and chicken.  No, no, they didn't have the rice, peas, and chicken.  Sunday meal, Sunday meal of rice, peas, and chicken. 
[01:55:30]  Opie, you're getting the story wrong.  Oh, they should have got the rice, peas, and chicken.  But instead, they got the spicy crab soup and the Chinese cabbage.  Cabbage and some kind of vegetable taro.  Taro.  Whatever that is.  And, uh...  Oh, no.  Diarrhea.  Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Angry prisoners on Monday dump scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the cell blocks in protest. 
[01:56:00]  That's great.  So they have the bed supper.  Everyone has diarrhea.  Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags.  You know what's great?  You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys.  What do they do?  They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages.  Correct.  Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons.  No.  Oh, my God.  Throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea.  That's great.  Now, the treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells for medication, 
[01:56:30]  fearing attacks from other inmates.  A special security team was going to cells to give inmates on-the-spot treatment if needed.  This medical team had to go from cell to cell to give them treatment as there's diarrhea all over their cells.  I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked, and ran away.  That old gag.  All right, so they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the epidemic. 
[01:57:00]  But there you have it.  A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica, suffering from diarrhea, Anthony.  Diarrhea.  After a bad Sunday suffering.  All right, we're clapping. 
[01:57:30]  We're clapping all over you.  Hey.  We're clapping.  How, how, how.  Uh-uh.  My pants are all full of goo.  Hey.  Uh-uh.  Hey.  Anyhow.  I can always see you through.  Hey.  Because every day we care the price.  We're delivered, sacrificed.  How, how, how.  Now it's true. 
[01:58:00]  Hey.  We're clapping.  Hey.  The diamond was a thing of the past.  The diamond.  And I hope the diamond's gonna last.  Hey.  The bullets must stop us now.  We take a bet, no, we won't buy.  Yeah.  Neither can be born or so.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[01:58:30]  Just feed the diarrhea. 
[01:59:00]  Spraying mud in Jamaica.  I like the new Fat Boy Slim. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, we're doing O&A Dictions on the show every day.  An outbreak of diarrhea in Jamaica happening.  I don't know what's happening about you. 
[02:00:00]  We're dropping.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  It must not be very...  You know how it sucks when you have diarrhea anyway,  and you're in the best of conditions.  Imagine that, a Jamaican prison. 
[02:00:30]  You're losing it.  All right.  Jesus.  I'll put the fart on this.  David, what's up, man?  Yo, how are you doing, guys?  Good.  What's up, David?  Yeah, I've got to figure it out.  I know what happened in Jamaica.  The warden was at the bottom of it.  He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there.  Hey!  That would definitely put a damper on it.  Hey!  Yeah, that would wreck the party, wouldn't it?  Absolutely.  You suck.  Keep it up.  All right, David.  Bye-bye.  Hey!  The whole prison looked like the mud people from Woodstock. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, he had that today.  Oh, stupid.  We had guys lifting stuff with their units.  Pro test.  Here's me taking a big food.  Tasteless.  Scotty, you've got to get our protective membrane vaginal seal back up.  I thought I had no fancy time.  Hey!  That is the rest of the jungle of kids.  We had guys come in that enjoy getting kicked in the nads. 
[02:01:30]  Tick, brother.  You really don't know where the, uh, tampons are, right?  Ivory has reloaded.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, that one just over eight feet.  O-B-M-A.  For the dopey-ass show.

[02:02:00]  Couldn't help ourselves.  It's such a nice day.  Tanya, what's going on?  Hi, it's Tanya.  I just wowed this guy, like, three times.  It was so funny.  Oh, thank you.  Where are you?  I was driving, and he was, like, chasing me on the Bronx River Parkway.  It was so funny.  I have a wow sign, and he has it, like, on his dirty Chevrolet something.  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  But see, he kept going one more time, one more time.  I didn't know what he was chasing me for.  No, we don't want the guys chasing ladies.  He was chasing.  He was on a chase on the Bronx River Parkway.  Now we're going to the Whitestone Bridge.  Just enjoy the wow, and move on. 
[02:02:30]  And move on with your lives.  Three swine.  I cut him off at the Throgs.  All right.  But you're flashing everyone out there for us today?  For you guys.  I went for you guys.  Well, we appreciate it.  We're hoping all the ladies do some flashing on the way home tonight.  I love you guys.  You know, I miss Jay Moore.  On Friday, I went home.  Yeah?

So I had a sign just written, and I was going past 22, and I just looked at a sign past  a carload full of girls, and they just started wowing me, man.  They just started showing everything.  It was great.  Oh, awesome.  Yeah.  The girls are very excited to wow today, Anthony.  Yes.  It's a beautiful thing.  I told you guys I love your show, man.  Thank you.

[02:04:00]  It's going to be just off the hook.  Oh, I know.  I can't wait.  Off the hook, yo.  Yo.  I got a story to tell you guys, though.  Huh?  About the next best thing to Viagra.  What?  The next best thing to Viagra.  I swear to God.  I had a flu a couple weeks ago, and I was picking Dayquil.  I had a few drinks one night, and I tell you what, all night long, it was phenomenal.  It definitely works, fellas.  Just Dayquil and a few beers.  Way about hours in this town, it works. 
[02:04:30]  Great.  Go on for a couple hours, fellas.  That's great.  Thank you, Joe.  Just try it out.  All right, man.  Take care, fellas.  Bye.  We don't advise you to try that out, right?

Well, we're trying to preview it today, and it looks like it's working out there.  That's excellent.  All right.  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  I'm going to ECW pay-per-view Sunday.  All right.  I'm in the second row right on TV. 
[02:05:00]  What would you like me to put on my sign?  Wow would be good.  Wow?  Yes.  How about we deliver keggers and a wow sign?  That could work, too.  Any sign that's related to the show, we'd love seeing on TV.  Excellent.  Just use your imagination, your creativity, okay?  All right.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Indication now.  All right, bye.  Bye.  The old boss is outside the studio.  Oh, what's he doing?  I've got to make fun of him really fast.  Why?  Hey, boss.  Hey, old boss.  Old boss in the studio.  You know, I heard you're trashing my basketball tickets. 
[02:05:30]  The guy that brought us to New York.  Boss, you don't like me anymore.  I love you.  You don't like me anymore.  I tell you, boss.  Let me, let me, um...  Well, I gave you the tickets to Vancouver?  Yeah.  Well, first...  Wait, listen, listen.  You saw a win.  Huh?  You saw a win.  I didn't see a win because I left really early.  I assumed they were going to win when I left the garden last night.  I've got to say, the last year when you were officially our boss...  Right.  And how many tickets did I get to the Knick games?  Tons.  Yeah, a lot.  And I got all the hot games. 
[02:06:00]  The hot games.  Lakers.  Celtics.  You know?  This year, Vancouver.  And your point is?  Vancouver is the most boring team in the NBA.  What game did I take you to?  What game did we go to, Anthony?  We went to...  Was that team with, like, black guys on it?  No, not Toronto.  You saved those for somebody else.  I would love to see Toronto.  Well, it's been more like an Earl groveling outside my door.  Oh, you have any tickets to nobody?  I don't go up there and bother you for tickets that much. 
[02:06:30]  What if black girl want hockey tickets?  Camps, basketball.  Yeah.  You know, all tickets are equal.  Yeah.  Every game.  I've got it.  Why didn't you want to go to the Vancouver game?  What was it?  It was last night?  And whoever you gave the other two seats to, because you have four...  They didn't show up either?  They didn't show up because the game sucked so bad.  Man.  The game was beat.  Vancouver...  Actually, I was home last night.  Yeah?  But I watched the game, so I was technically there.  Ah, yeah.  I just wasn't with you.  I was with you in spirit.  How's traffic on the ones? 
[02:07:00]  You know what?  I haven't been up there in about 20 minutes, but last I checked, it was still on the ones.  I don't know how you do it.  There's all this news, okay?  No, bear with me.  There's all this news every day on 1010 Wins, which you are the GM of.  And it doesn't matter how much news or how little news there is every any given day.  On the ones, there's traffic.  You go to traffic.  It's amazing, right?  How do you fill the spots between the ones with news and everything else that goes on? 
[02:07:30]  You know what?  No matter how much or little, where every 10 minutes on the ones, there's traffic.  If I told you how he did it, I'd have to kill you.  That's true.  See, it's one of the trade secrets.  It's a secret.  It's a secret.  That's great.  I love the traffic.  But you know what?  Yesterday, driving home, I was listening to you guys at the 6 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  We got you on the studio camp, boss.  So, I'm glad to see you.  Here's the guy that brought us to New York.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Luca Brasi in this picture.  He really does. 
[02:08:00]  Tony Soprano, right?  Yeah.  So, last night, I'm driving home, and I'm listening to the show.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  You've got some young girl on.  Everyone's giving her advice.  Oh, the anal sex advice?  Right.  There's another one of those days that I said,  It's so much more fun to listen to this show than to be the general man.  Thank God you're not in charge anymore.  You know, the new boss said exactly what you said.  Did he really?  He said, you guys are going to be something if you don't blow yourselves up.  Yeah.  He was starting to get a little itchy.  He was all right.  So, you're trying to say that he sounded a little like me? 
[02:08:30]  A little bit.  A little bit.  You could tell.  Ken was like, I've never heard him talk like that since he's been here.  And all of a sudden, it's like, yeah, yeah, no, no.  You guys will do great.  If you don't self-destruct.  If you don't self-destruct, you can get yourself fired.  He runs one of the radio networks in town.  He says to me, God, you look great.  You look better than you looked at about two years, I said.  He goes, yeah, two years.  We are like a cancer that has been taken out of you.  And it's in total remission.  I love you, too.  You guys are like my fourth and fifth children. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  A little less mature than your real children.  You look so much healthier, boss.  Those children that you have to keep going to school for, for drug problems.  You know what I'm talking about, I'll look for better tickets for you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I will check my stash.  Really?  Yeah.  Because Vancouver was really boring.  In fact, to me.  The girlfriend was bored, too.  To make it up to you.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  To make it up to you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Because I know Anthony doesn't like basketball.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  If you want to go to the Big East Championship game on Saturday night. 
[02:09:30]  Whoa, yes.  You can come see me tomorrow.  Okay.  I can handle that.  Boss.  Did you hear who Anthony's picking in the 20 this year?  Iona.  I'm going with Spaz's alma mater.  Iona College.  Remember our deal with Spaz and Iona?  Yeah.  Remember that?  I remember that.  They wanted to throw Spaz out of school and not give him a diploma because he worked on this show.  They wanted to throw Spaz out, but they'll let Jeff Ruhlin coach.  I mean, explain that to me.  Isn't that amazing?  Hey, boss. 
[02:10:00]  Life isn't fair.  You've got to be honest with me, though.  I know you look so much better since you've abandoned us, and I'm sure you feel a lot better,  but there isn't just a piece of you when you're upstairs, maybe in a meeting with Larry Kofsky  talking about what he should do first, the Dow or the NASDAQ.  Maybe there's a piece of just, there was a little bit of excitement in your life there  when you were in charge of this ship.  And I said ship.  Either word would have been appropriate. 
[02:10:30]  Really?  So you don't miss us.  No, that's not true.  No, it was a great time.  You don't miss the phone calls where people are yelling at us through the speakerphone?  I don't miss that.  And lawyers knocking on your door all hours of the day?  If it's Scott Herman, are you the gentleman, those two idiots, degenerates you have on your station,  I'm going to file with everybody.  No, the worst calls were, how could you run 10-10 wins and put those guys on the air?  God damn, what the hell are you doing? 
[02:11:00]  You can't keep them boys in control.  We love them.  We want a long, prosperous career with the company.  And they're doing very well, I understand that.  But I don't care what the ratings are, they don't put any more crap like they thought they're gone.  We had to hear that in his office, remember that, Ant?  We're getting yelled at.  But nothing worse than, like, your boss's boss yelling at you in front of your boss.  Oh, my God.  He would sit us down on his fine leather couch up there, and all of a sudden he would go, 
[02:11:30]  someone wants to talk to you, and Ant and I would be like, oh.  And this is what would come through the speakers, the phone.  Boss, I swear to God, you are gone.  If I hear anything else like you've been doing, you can't do it.  Now it's calls like this.  All right, hey, Scott, how's it going?  How's traffic on the ones?  Very good.  I love that traffic on the ones.  Money coming in?  Good, good.  You're doing great, great.  But mark my words. 
[02:12:00]  Wow, that's good.  He gets to play golf during the day and all that.  Golf, he's doing it back to his lunches, he's smiling at Patsy's, he's having a great time.  No longer having to deal with these two bastard stepchildren.  Well, I love you boys.  Sorry, got to go.  All right, there he goes.  Look, he could just leave now.  He doesn't have to worry about the rest of the show.  Okay, terrific.  There you go.  Thanks a lot, Scott. 
[02:12:30]  Scott Herman.  Okay, terrific, yes.  Quick, Scott, you only got three minutes before traffic on the ones.  Make sure it's there.  There you go, Scott Herman, the guy who brought us to New York, who's no longer our boss.  Now we can really abuse him.  It's great, isn't it?  Isn't it the best?  You know, I understand he's a lot more relaxed and stuff, but you can't tell me that he goes  upstairs to wins and he's having a gay old time.  Just a great shindig party going on upstairs at 10-10 wins. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he's got to miss the debauchery of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, remember that?  Yesterday, we're in our office and a couple of guys, who was it?  Who came down?  One of the sales guys or was it somebody from wins?  I didn't see it.  It was Pete.  Oh, yeah, Pete, the engineer, comes in and he goes, hey, there's pizza upstairs at wins.  So we're like, oh, damn, we ordered lunch already, but what are they doing? 
[02:13:30]  Having a party up at wins?  They're like, yeah, they're celebrating Super Tuesday.  They were having like a big party up there to celebrate Super Tuesday.  Woo-hoo!  They're crazy up there at wins.  You know what wins is like?  Wins is like the AV squad in school.  Remember the kids, they knew how to run the movie projectors,  and when the film used to go, they knew where to stick the pencil eraser to make it stop.  That's them. 
[02:14:00]  They were the math team.  It's just not fair because wins is upstairs, we're down here, and our lives have to collide.  They hate sharing their pizza with us.  Pizza party?  Oh, my God, Lee Harris is out of control.  Look at him.  He's got a wins night flag on his head, and he's jumping around.  He's dancing with John Montone.  If the word gets out that there's free food in the building, we go upstairs and try to  snag some like anyone would, and they give us the look like, oh, they're up here. 
[02:14:30]  It's just culture shock.  Yeah, and then they have to run into all the crazy lunatics that stop our show on a daily  basis when they're trying to do their, you know, traffic on the ones.  Pizza on the ones.  We're waxenarific on this Super Tuesday.  I don't know, Super Tuesday.  I might actually have a drink.  Ho, ho.  They're wacky celebrating Super Tuesday.  They're just waiting for the glory.  You know, there's pictures upstairs of the Avianca crash. 
[02:15:00]  They're just waiting for another glory day of a nice, good New York plane crash.  A good snowstorm or something.  In the meantime, just make sure that traffic's on the ones.  In the meantime, they've got to check out the people in the lobby waiting to come on  our show.  Jesus.  Listen, I'm John Montone, and I want pepperoni.  Yes.  Having a blast. 
[02:15:30]  Yes.  Jessica.  Hey, guys.  How are you, Jessica?  Great.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  I just wanted to tell all the ladies that it's a total rush to wow, and the fact that guys  love it, no matter what you look like, you have to go out and do it for them.  A bad set is still a good set, I'm telling you.  Foreign boob rocks.  Exactly.  What I'm saying is, I'm not very large-chested, and so I would be hesitant to do it, and I  did it, and they love it anyway.  It makes it so good.  It makes their week. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, it totally does.  Although, I have to say one thing, and I'm totally not trying to change the subject, but  if the Yankees play in regular season, the way they're playing in preseason right now,  my wowing is going to slow down a whole lot.  No.  Don't worry about it.  It's preseason.  They're still weaning themselves off of the cocaine of the season.  It's okay.  Yeah, they don't do that well in preseason all the time anyway, but I'm upset.  The Mets won last night.  Oh, gee, only eight billion games to go. 
[02:16:30]  I hope they do okay.  I hate you people that get into the preseason like this.  It means nothing.  I don't know why George Steinbrenner's freaking.  It means nothing.  The season hasn't started.  They're trying to figure out who they want.  They're trying to figure out their pitching rotation, who's going to make the team.  Don't worry about it.  They're trying out stuff.  You want to try stuff out during the real season?  No.  No.  So you do it on preseason.  Yeah.  I really don't normally care.  I never, ever pay attention. 
[02:17:00]  But everybody's ribbing me.  Oh, you're a Yankee fan.  You're a Yankee fan.  And they're doing so bad.  So I just wanted to let everybody know.  I just...  It doesn't matter.  I don't even follow preseason.  They have the scores.  Warner Wolfe's doing the scores the other night.  The Yankees could be in trouble.  You know?  We just need a good tragedy.  The Yankees need a good tragedy.  The Darryl Strawberry thing, it's not really a tragedy.  It's tragic, but in its own right.  Somebody needs cancer.  We all were expecting him to, you know, fall off the wagon.  We need one of those tragedy stories for the Yankees. 
[02:17:30]  Come on, Jeter's got a hemavoid.  Because they get one every year, right?  They do.  It's crazy.  They rally around tragedies, though, so...  Well, you know, maybe they'll be listening to you guys in the spring,  and you'll hear the fact that their female fans really want them to win,  and they'll make New York happy.  Hey, Jessica, screw that.  How bad do you want to bang Derek Jeter?  No way!  No way!  Who do you want to bang on the Yankees?  If you had your chance for a throwdown. 
[02:18:00]  You know, I really...  Come on.  I think Tino Martinez is better than Derek Jeter.  Chuck Knobloch, right?  He's not block.  Ew!  Yeah.  He's not even a good player, let alone good-looking.  Well, who would you have throwdown?  Have you...  Have...  Yeah, you know what I'm saying.  Getting tired here.  You want Joe Torre?  You want Torre?  No way.  None of them.  None of them.  Just imagine what he could do with that nose.  The Zim.  The Zim.  I definitely...  I definitely don't...  Don Zimmer putting on his army helmet and going in. 
[02:18:30]  Don Zimmer.  I don't think Jeter's that hot, but he's...  With Don, you get the penetration, but also the stimulation from his belly rubbing on your  most intimate of areas.  No, but he's definitely better looking than...  I can't believe they put him up against Piazza.  Yeah.  All right.  It's nasty.  All right.  So...  Yeah, let's talk about ballplayers and how good they look.  Okay.  Let's talk about the fact that...  I don't know.  You got to give it to Piazza.  Who has a better ass?  Don Zimmer or Joe Torre?  Remember they had that in the paper of, what, last year? 
[02:19:00]  Zimmer, I don't know.  There's got to be a few dimples on that one.  No, it was...  Who had a better ass, Piazza or Jeter?  Piazza, Jeter.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with Piazza.  No, screw that, though.  Zimmer or Torre?  Who would you...  Who would you bang that?  Who would you throw a charity F to?  That's really tough.  It's really tough.  Come on.  Really tough choice.  Come on.  Yeah, you're crazy to worry about the Yankees.  We got to worry about the Knicks.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Knicks don't have a...  Not a prayer.  I don't think there's anything to worry about anymore. 
[02:19:30]  Their mind's pretty much made up, right?  Who?  The Knicks.  Knicks?  Nah, they're going to give it a run for the money this year.  I hope so, because...  You got to get Kambi back, you know.  I know you're rooting for him, Opie, so I hope so.  Yes, I am.  But you know what?  Lakers are going to win it all.  Unstoppable.  Unfreaking unstoppable.  Oh, basketball.  Sorry.  Sorry, Anthony.  Sorry.  Is that okay?  Is that okay with you?  Well, how do they pick the team?  They go to the lineup, and whoever's above the seven-foot mark, they...  Put it on the team? 
[02:20:00]  A lot of dudes.  Is it okay that the Lakers win the championship?  What are you...  I mean, aren't you going to be bummed?  What are you, high?  Of course I'm going to be bummed.  But that's reality.  They got to...  It's going to be...  You sound like you're cheering them on.  No.  I think that...  I don't see anyone beating them this year.  You think that Utah...  The Utah Jazz is going to do it?  No.  No.  You think that the Spurs are going to do it again this year?  No.  No.  I just said that you sounded like you were cheering them on, and I just don't...  You know, you switch around a lot with your teams, I think.  No, no.  Basketball, Knicks, all the way. 
[02:20:30]  All the way.  Girls and sports, this is great.  How big are your fun bags?  What I do is I'm a Mets fan, but when the Mets get knocked out, then I help the Yankees  along.  I cheer them a little bit.  That's a little weird, I understand.  And I'm an Islander fan, not a Ranger fan.  Well, I'm the only one that's going to admit it around here.  That's good.  Yeah, I know.  I heard you guys talking about that a few weeks ago.  The Islanders, too bad for them, right?  All right, Jessica.  If the team doesn't show up, attendance is down 50%. 
[02:21:00]  Okay, good, cool.  It's amazing.  I'm on for you, all right?  Thank you, Jessica.  Thank you for wowing.  We appreciate that today.  We hope all the ladies do that today on the way home, okay?  No problem.  See you guys later.  All right, Jessica, what are our sports report today?  Yeah, look at that.  And we dug up something from the O&A archives.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Stay there.  1-1-1-0-2-7, WNEW.  Speaking of baseball, did you see the article in the Daily News today?  Ah, they've got to get this point of view across, I guess.  Baseball diamonds are a gal's best friend. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, the hunk-o-meter.  Yeah, they're pitting Jeter against Piazza, obviously, for a hunk.  Who's the biggest hunk?  Who's the biggest hunk, yeah, Jeter or Piazza?  She's got a bunch of stats and everything.  This is Cheryl Connelly from the Daily News.  You know, this lady smokes crack.  She has to.  She's writing a whole article on this, right, Ant?  Yeah.  And where he'd take you for a weekend getaway, Dirk Jeter.  This lady assumes that Dirk Jeter would take you to meet his mom. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  I don't care that he calls the Yankees.  Is that what he calls his penis, Mom?  Exactly.  I'll take you to meet my mom.  She's delusional.  He's a guy, for Christ's sake.  Don't you live the Comac motorist?  Brother.  Odds on getting to third base with Dirk Jeter.  Only if you're a pop diva who can hit the high notes.  Oh, ho, ho.  I think she's trying to be wacky.  Wow, that was worth being on page nine of the Daily News today. 
[02:22:30]  Is this sports?  Odds on getting to third base with Piazza.  Only if you can dress flashier than he does.  Does any sports fan really care about this?  I guess she's catering to the ladies or something.  Hey, Mad Dog, are you trying to tell me you're bored with taking phone calls about the Mets and the Yankees? 
[02:23:00]  Well, this is in the paper today.  I think it's sports over the end of the end.  What would you like to talk to?  Sports, you know, concerned sports.  Would you like to talk to some of your listeners today?  Yeah, why not?  I think we can take a few phone calls.  All right, why don't you throw the topic out there?  Well, who's the biggest hunk?  Jeter or Piazza.  Yeah, I've seen them both.  I've been looking at them.  I've got to give Jeter a yes.  But Piazza's got the arms, and I think that Piazza's a little hairier. 
[02:23:30]  I prefer my men with a hairy chest.  And I don't know if I like Piazza.  He's squatting all the time, being a catcher.  You don't want the testicles dragging in the dirt like that.  It could make calluses, and I don't think I want to handle callousy testicles.  You know what I mean?  That's right, Dork.  And, gee, you know, he's been with some hose bags in his day, but I think I could turn him around.  I'd take him in the backseat of my torridor, torridor.  So who would you give the rusty trombone to? 
[02:24:00]  Well, you've got to go with Piazza on a rusty trombone.  Because I'm not reaching for the testicles.  I'm giving him a reach-around.  But you've got to figure out what a catcher is squatting and a lot of air blowing through about that.  It's not going to stink.  It's maybe a Jeter who's standing up a lot.  All right, let's go to the phones, all right?  It's a great topic for your show today on WFAG.  All right, Joe, you're on the air.  I'm not going to have a dog on the back.  Hi, I'd just like to say that Meister Piazza has the best ass.  What are you talking about? 
[02:24:30]  You've got to give Jeter the ass.  I'm an ass man.  I know.  Jeter's got the better ass.  Come on.  Come on, my friend.  Hey, that pun's a steal.  You don't see him there when he's behind the plate.  Crouch down or bent over like that.  It gets me so excited.  Thank you, Joe.  We never have to say clothes like this on a van.  As far as headless go, I don't know.  I kind of like the aqua for Piazza's button.  Better than that short thing, Jeter's button.  You don't like that wacky beard of Piazza's or the wacky sideburn? 
[02:25:00]  No, I like a little bit of hair on my thighs.  You know?  No, I don't like the short hair that Jeter's got.  No?  But I give him the ass.  Okay.  And I'm a man.  That's right, dork.  I've undressed both of these with my eyes.  And, you know, I've got to give, like I said, the ass to Jeter.  And chest and arms to Piazza.  Nice, strong, manly arms.  No surprise you like the Giants.  Yeah, he could probably. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, Piazza, I know.  If I'm in a sack with him, he could throw me around like a little spinner.  You know, a strong upper-body spring.  But I think for Jeter, it would be a lot more sensitive.  To mind your feminine needs.  That's right, dork.  Joe, you're on the air with Mad Dog.  Is this Mad Dog?  Am I going to Mad Dog, Joe?  Out of bed.  How you doing?  What do you think, Joe?  I think that Jeter's better.  In what way?  And that Howard Stern's better than the ballpark.  That's the Papa Louie. 
[02:26:00]  Can't curse on you, Joe.  Oh, brother.  This is just getting bad.  That was pretty funny, too, to be out of here.  All right, let's take another break here, all right?  Are you done now, Mad Dog?  Why don't you bring Imus in with you today?  Oh, jeez.  You want to go there?  No. 
[02:26:30]  Got my big fag cowboy hat on my lap here as I'm looking at Piazza.  Yeah.  And it's growing.  Yeah, that guy gets the wrinkle out of my neck.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a Kevlar kind of day.  1027 WNEW.

Going absolutely crazy with my buddy Todd. 
[02:30:00]  What?  You got a wow banner for the Big East Tournament?  We got two of them.  We got the map of Hawaii on the bottom.  Okay, terrific.  Everything.  You name it.  People are going nuts to the garden for you guys today.  Right on, man.  Thank you for supporting the show.  You guys are the best.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Charlie.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How are you, Charlie?  What's going on?  L-I-E Eastbound, brother?  What?  You getting wowed?  You got wowed.  Me and my partner were in the ICB at the caddy truck.  Well, very good.  Well, listen. 
[02:30:30]  We want to thank the ladies for helping us out today.  Yeah.  Can I say one thing, Meathead?  Meathead?  Meathead.  Yeah, go ahead.  What's going on with you guys talking to this woman about sports when she doesn't know anything,  and either you guys don't know anything either?  Eh, we know enough.  Hope he knows.  I don't know.  We know enough.  Yeah, I know.  What do you want?  Why?  What did you want to say?  I want to hear some good stuff.  What happened to the shortened thing you had?  What happened?  Dude, we're having a killer show.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  You shut up.  I'll come down and smack you upside the head, you little wuss. 
[02:31:00]  Sure you will, Charlie.  Yeah, you want to see it happen today?  Oh, come on up.  Come on up.  We'll kick your ass.  I don't want you to come down here.  You don't want that.  Come on down, Charlie.  Come on down.  Let's have some fun.  Let's have some fun.  Go right on our parade today, pal.  We're having a good time.  Are you going to compare sewing tips with that lady next?  What?  Is that supposed to be a joke?  I don't get it.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  You got me, Charlie.  What can I tell you?  I'm a bird.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You hear him?  He was a hit with his friends.  You hear it in the background?  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  You got him.  We got him.  Huh?  What?  What?  What?  Jackass.  Nothing's going to stop us today.  I'm in a good goddamn mood.  Having too much fun.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  What else did we want to get to today?  Thirsty monkeys?  This, I have to say, is the story of the day.  I thought we did story of the day already.  You didn't think that?  And crapping Jamaican prisoners?  You didn't think the diarrhea in Jamaica was the story of the day, Anthony? 
[02:32:00]  Very close to being story of the day.  But, well, you know something?  I think it's a toss-up, but the Jamaican prisoners having diarrhea, isn't it?  What about the whole Dice greeting cards thing?  No, I think.  That could be story of the day.  His new career, he gave us a taste today.  Clinton and the screensaver being amazing.  Being amazed by the screensaver?  Yeah.  Clinton?  Yeah.  That could be story of the day?  Yeah.  I think that was story of the day.  But this, I mean, come on.  All right.  How the hell did this happen?  Well, let me read a little bit for you, Anthony. 
[02:32:30]  Thirsty monkeys stoned herdsmen to death.  I love this.  Cue music.  No.  In Nairobi, a group of thirsty monkeys stoned a herdsmen to death in drought-stricken northern Kenya  as he watered his livestock, a newspaper reported Thursday.  Why?  In a clear sign of worsening drought, a herdsmen was killed after the rioting monkeys stoned him  at a watering point. 
[02:33:00]  A nurse in the district said the man died from severe head injury.  Head injury?  Good aim on the monkeys.  Damn.  Why?  All they wanted was a little bit of water.  Could he not spare a few drops of water for these poor primates?  My God!  Just a little taste of water for their red monkey asses. 
[02:33:30]  And everything would have been fine.  He'd have been alive today.  But no, he did not the monkeys.  Damn you!  Damn you!  I remember it.  I needed water.  And Zira came up and gave me a drink of water.  God damn it, I love that monkey bitch.  She gave me water. 
[02:34:00]  I got water from a monkey!  And he wouldn't give water back to these poor thirsty monkeys!  Damn him!  They gave you a lot of water when you were in that cage with the...  It's a mad house!  A mad house!  God damn good aim on the monkeys!  Head injury!  Yeah.  Crack shots! 
[02:34:30]  You know, they couldn't hit me with bullets when Dr. Zayas was shooting.  But they...  They hit him in the head with rocks!  How does a monkey know that the guy has water and he isn't giving it to him?  I know!  I don't understand this story!  Explain that one!  There's no way the monkey knows he has water!  They didn't know to pick a rock and throw him at him!  Are you sure this was Nairobi?  Maybe they're smarter than we thought, isn't it? 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  They are intelligent.  Smart monkeys.  They live in little clay houses.  I've seen it!  Take your stinking paws off me, damn dirty ape!  Oh, ho, Nellie!  Noh-ho, noh-ho, noh-ho.  Look, they're throwing rocks at noh-ho.  That's noh-ho, noh-ho.  I just don't get it.  Bunch of riotous monkeys. 
[02:35:30]  Let me get this straight.  All right.  Riotous monkeys.  Yeah.  Red-ass stupid monkeys.  Right.  See a sheep herder.  Yes.  Giving water to his sheep.  Correct.  They get mad because he's not giving them water.  Correct.  And they start throwing rocks.  Right.  Why did they just go and take the water?  I don't know.  There was more of them, right?  Yes. 
[02:36:00]  My God, man.  That's an amazing story.  Either this guy is incredibly stupid, or those are some smart monkeys.  I'd have kicked him in their tiny red asses.  Yes.  Yes.  What's that, Cornelius?  Zero's pregnant, and it's not yours. 
[02:36:30]  Damn, you caught me again.  I couldn't, I couldn't take my hands off of her staggy monkey udders.  That red ass is a bullseye for John.  I love it.  Are you sure?  I still, I don't understand.  Are you sure, baby?  Are you sure they weren't drinking malt liquor?  That's all I gotta say.  I mean. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Oh, my God.  Huh.  Maybe it was Reginald Denny.  Ah.  What?  Seattle Doodle.  Bone dry.  Bone dry, damn you.  Apologize.  Apologize.  No wonder they throw rocks.  Bone dry, yeah.  Bone dry, yeah.  Damn monkeys. 
[02:37:30]  I heard they, uh, they threw 41, uh, rocks.  Yes.  But only 19 hit him.  Right.  But I heard he was down, and they kept throwing rocks at him.  Bastard monkeys.  The guy was just holding his wallet, and they threw rocks at him, and continued, even when  as he was down.  Why damn you? 
[02:38:00]  Damn.  They just said, please, can we have some water in their native monkey, Dung?  No justice, no peace.  Absolutely.  No justice.  Maybe, uh, the Yankees can recruit these guys.  He's a cool cat.  He's a cool cat, indeed.  It's just said, when you see riotous monkeys, give them water, for God's sake.  What's wrong with you?  All right.  I've never thought they were that smart. 
[02:38:30]  There'll be a rally at noon tomorrow.  I've never heard this.  What to do?  What to do?  Riotous monkeys!  All right, listen.  Yeah, I'm all the one of your life.  Drive me.  Oh, my God.  It's awful.  Okay, terrific.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  More of your phone calls in just a bit.  Jesus.  Horrifying.  All right, all right, all right.  He keeps coming back.  Apologizing.  All right, phone number 212-757-1027.  We'll go to the phones next.  Oh, Pete Anthony.  Those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table. 
[02:39:30]  1027-WNEW.  And we're back.  It's the O&A Show.  We're having lots and lots of fun today.  Hell, yeah.  Benji, what's going on tonight?  Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  I wanted to get mad with you, but then I started laughing so hard.  What were you going to get mad at me for?  Oh, you're bringing up that maybe the monkeys were drinking malt liquor. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, the monkey stoning the shepherd in Africa store?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then he said they, oh, I think it was Opie said he was down and they still started stoning.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I mean, but.  So you wanted to be mad, but then you started laughing, right, Fancy?  Yeah.  In them all the hell.  But I couldn't stay mad with you guys.  Smug monkeys.  Poor monkeys threw 41 rocks at them 19 times. 
[02:40:30]  The shepherd just didn't know how to deal with the monkeys.  Like I dealt with Zira.  You know how you deal with Zira in the monkeys?  Benji, shut up and let me talk.  Damn you.  When I was with Zira and Cornelius was with Dr. Zayas far away in the forbidden zone, I  was hanging out and wanted a piece of Zira.  She wanted no part of me because I had just shaved the hair from my face and she found 
[02:41:00]  that as ugly.  Isn't that ironic?  And all of a sudden, I wanted a piece of a red monkey mandrel ass.  That's the forbidden zone.  So what did I do?  Yeah.  I pulled out my junk and said, hey, what are we going to do about this?  And it worked.  It worked.  She was all over me.  Thank you, J. Moore.  It even works with primates.  I shot a tray up in that piece. 
[02:41:30]  Good God.  I partook in monkey ass.  Once you go monkey, you never go clunky.  It doesn't rhyme.  No, it doesn't.  I know what I'm talking about.  Okay.  It's Benji.  Well, thank you, Benji.  Oh, you're welcome.  You're enjoying the show today?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Very good.  Yes.  You know, I kept saying I wanted to come down there.  I'll do something crazy.  Do something crazy, Benji?  Yeah.  I might.  Yeah.  Yeah? 
[02:42:00]  I've been known to do crazy stuff.  All right.  Do you want to get into the kiddie pool Friday?  Um, I don't know.  I was really thinking about it.  Really?  Yeah, I was.  I would check out your body.  But, oh, I have to get in.  I thought we could be on the outside.  You don't have a red ass, do you?  No, no, no.  Okay, just checking.  Nothing worse than red monkey ass.  No, no, nothing red is my hair.  It's not cranky ass, is it?  Oh, no.  Nothing worse than red monkey cranky ass.  You know, when the monkey thinks it's done popping the nugget. 
[02:42:30]  The monkey thinks it's done popping the last bit of milk done.  And then walks around for about a mile.  Gets red cranky mandrel ass.  A lot of callbacks today, I like that.  Yes.  All right, Benji.  Okay, so you guys in syndication cross the nation for ONA's operation.  Ooh, look at you rhyming.  Yeah, I'm black.  What do you want?  Can you do a little rhyme about the ONA show?  No, not off the cuff like that. 
[02:43:00]  No, if you get one, call us back.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  What's that?  Bye, Benji.  Bye.  Bye.  Damn.  We love Benji.  Wonderful.  Donna, from Flushing, on the instant feedback, just for your information, guys,  there's a good article in PC Gamer Magazine in the April 2000 issue called The Sims Game  of the Year already.  Wow, really?  Game of the Year already?  Wow.  I got to admit, I haven't been taking care of the Little Sims family lately because I've 
[02:43:30]  gotten tied up in another game.  Another one?  Another game kind of came across my transom, and I picked it up, and I've never been so  confused with a game in my life.  F-18.  It's a flight sim game of an F-18.  And I swear to God, I popped this thing up, I can't do a thing.  I fly the thing, I fly missions, I can't lock my missiles on anything, I can't kill anything, 
[02:44:00]  and I get killed in two seconds.  Is it one of those games where the booklet is just like 500 pages?  The book is huge.  I hate those games.  There's a whole big keyboard layout thing, and there's target acquiring buttons that I  push, and my target isn't acquired.  All of a sudden, I'm like, surface dam, it's a launch, surface dam, it's a launch, tap,  tap, flare, flare, tap, tap.  That's it.  My plane's dead.  Eject, again.  I've been through about five or six planes a day.  I can't figure it out. 
[02:44:30]  So why don't you just blow it off and go back to Sims or Half-Life?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I have to figure it out.  I got to figure it out.  I have to figure it out.  Anthony has to figure out everything.  I can't lock on, like I'm supposed to destroy these ships?  Mm-hmm.  The graphics are really cool.  And I come up, I try to lock the weapon onto something.  No, nothing.  I can't do it.  And it pisses me off.  I got to get back to the Sims, though.  I don't even know what's happening.  I think I left that family on autopilot.  They're probably dead.  Andrew. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Hey.  I also got F-18 like about a month ago.  Yeah.  When it first came out.  Yeah.  Dude, I can't even get the throttle up.  He doesn't know where the gas pedal is.  I got a brand-new Athlon, 750.  It's not that new anymore because they got 1,000.  But this thing, I can't control it.  I just simply cannot control this thing.  Does anyone in their 30s play video games?  Every time we talk about video games, we go to the phones. 
[02:45:30]  How old are you, man?  I'm 14.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, Spaz did not let me through on my birthday.  Okay?  You guys screwed me over big time.  Why don't we screw you?  Instead of being with my friends, I was playing The Sims and listening to your show on my birthday.  Oh, cool.  Well, that's not a bad birthday.  All right, Andrew.  Well, good luck finding the throttle.  No, actually, I bought a throttle, and that doesn't even work.  He's just sitting on the carrier deck. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  All right, Andrew.  There's a guy that knows what Anthony's doing wrong.  We need to help out our pal Anthony.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to the car.  I'll try this.  Jim, you're next on N.E.W.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey.  You got your sea radar on or your regular ground air radar on?  I got the sea radar.  Okay.  Now, you got to make sure that you use the cursors to slew around the target box.  What?  What?  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm going to pass five.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to pass five.  You know what it is?  I could drop bombs on the damn ships, but I want a cool missile that locks on. 
[02:46:30]  What missile are you using?  I'm using, I don't know, one of those little sidewinder action.  I don't know of it.  Yeah, you can use that.  You can use a P something.  Yeah, you can use a Maverick, too.  Yeah, but I want something I can lock onto the ships.  Yeah, Maverick.  Oh, I can't lock anything on it.  Yeah, you got to be doing something wrong with the radar setting.  Oh, my God.  You really got to.  I fly the Falcon 4-0.  It's the same, you know, same thing.  Yeah.  And when you do a sea-to-air mission, you know, you have to get everything exactly right, 
[02:47:00]  and you got to slew the cursor over the ship, and then it should start breathing, you know,  moving in and out.  Then you lock it on.  All right.  I'll give it a try.  It's hard.  I'm not going to tell you it's easy.  It's really hard.  I just get frustrated and kamikaze right into the damn thing.  That's what I do.  Banzai.  Hey, you know what's a good blast?  What?  You pick a Lightning 3, F-22 Lightning 3, you can drop an atomic bomb.  See, that's cool, too.  I remember the old, I guess it was, yeah, F-18 for Mac, like five years ago. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  You used to be able to drop a tactical nuke on some dam.  Yeah.  They don't have any nukes in this one, in the Janes F-18.  No, no, because it's realistic.  They're not permitted to carry nukes on them.  I want a nuke.  You want a nuke?  Go get F-22 Lightning 3 from NovaLogic.  They do a great helicopter game, too.  It's always good dropping nuclear weapons on your own air base when you take off and nuke  your own base.  You want to talk about this as your own?  Boom.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thank you, Jim.  Anytime.  Bye-bye.  I'm waiting for the PlayStation 2.  There's rumors floating around this place that we might be able to get our hands on a couple  of those dead boys.  Yeah, with Jap instructions and, like, the whole thing.  Who cares?  Well, you know when you start up a game and it says, like, start and select and thing,  it'll all be chong-pang, chong-pang, chong-pang.  I'll figure it out.  Oh, you'll figure it out.  I'll try.  I don't care.  I want to see the graphics of this game.  Chang-pang. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know.  Either that or I'm going to just have to pick up Siphon Filter 2.  And then there's no games for it yet.  So you'll be sitting there playing your old games on it.  There's a few games.  They'll give us the games, too, right?  And Chang-pang.  Some kind of samurai game, I'm sure.  Yeah.  You know, I'll figure it out.  We're very into the Japanese anime.  Anime.  Oh.  With the samurai sword things.  Spin, cut, head off.  Game over.  See ya.  All right.  We were going to get to the penis doctor. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  The penis doctor?  Well, the Daily News is running a great series.  They're running the 15 most sued doctors in New York.  And every day they're featuring another doctor.  Hey, and today's doctor is the penis doctor.  What?  Could you tell the guy on line 11, because he's got a code, might have a cheat code for an atomic bomb for the F-18?  I know sometimes they have cheat codes where you could add in an atomic bomb.  So if you want to put them on the air?  Yeah.  All right.  Real fast.  Go ahead.  Nick, what's up?  How you doing? 
[02:49:30]  Hey, how you doing?  All right, guys.  What's the code for?  Okay, in the beginning, you've got to put semi-colon, take it in your rear real hard, and then you've got the game.  He let me through again, guys.  He let me through again.  Take it in the rear.  Because I know there's cheat codes.  Thanks, Nick.  We can add weapons.  Mike Boccafoli sucks.  All right.  He got stats again.  All right.  Head off to the penis doctor.  Well, I don't know.  The series is pretty funny. 
[02:50:00]  Every day they're featuring another doctor that is just the worst.  Boots.  The 15 most suited doctors in New York.  Mm-hmm.  And this guy has botched up so many damn penis surgeries, it's not even funny.  Mm-hmm.  First of all, why would you get surgery on your penis, Anthony?  To make it bigger or fatter.  Yeah, but longer or fatter.  But those operations are just not guaranteed whatsoever.  Must be really desperate guys.  Do you know how they make your penis longer?  They suck fat.  No, no.  Longer.  Longer.  Oh, they cut a ligament.  They cut the base, and then they pull it out like you're pulling a cord. 
[02:50:30]  You know the vacuum cleaners where the cord goes in?  Pulling taffy.  Yeah.  They pull a little more cord out, and then they sew you back up.  Ah!  Yeah.  That's what makes it longer, because you've got a good, I don't know, inch or so that,  you know.  That never comes out.  That never comes out.  It's at the base.  So they just, like you said, they cut the ligament, they pull it out like they're pulling  more cord out of the vacuum cleaner there, and then they sew you back up.  Sew the ligament back up. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  Hey!  Now, you can explain the making the penis thicker one, Anthony.  Yeah, they take fat from various places on your body and inject it into your ween to  make it fatter.  Blow it up like a tuna can.  I don't know.  Well, this guy promised to make people longer and thicker and stuff, and he pretty much just  made Franken-peckers all over the tri-state area.  There's a couple examples. 
[02:51:30]  A 37-year-old Long Island contractor was left with scarring that caused his penis to twist  painfully and led to hospitalization for infections.  Looked like a cruller.  It's a corkscrew.  A 44-year-old Long Island landlord endures daily therapy in which he hangs weights from  his penis to break up scar tissue left by multiple operations.  Hangs weights from it.  That's great.  A 46-year-old security guard has to use a pump to achieve erection and takes psychiatric 
[02:52:00]  medication to help him control the rage he feels for Schwartz.  This guy on the line had the surgery.  Charlie, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Listen, my dad had it done about a month ago.  Your dad had his penis enlarged? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, the thing turned purple.  Now he's got to stick this big syringe thing in the tip of it?  Are you serious?  In the urine out?  Oh, it's so much trouble.  Don't even bother.  What?  He's thinking about getting it.  Wait, Charlie, you sound like you're for real.  Your dad really had the surgery to get thicker or longer?  Longer.  Longer and thicker, actually.  Damn it.  And...  Why would he get that done?  I don't know.  I didn't make that.  What am I going to ask him?  And he told you that he had the...  He told me he's in bed.  He's living in bed for about two weeks now.  Really?  Yeah, he can't move. 
[02:53:00]  The thing is...  Oh, it's disgusting.  It's terrible.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Howard Stern rules!  Yeah, we kind of knew it, you ass.  This guy...  Dude, get this.  Go ahead.  He recalled this guy calling Schwartz to complain about pain and being told,  don't worry about it.  Be a man about the pain.  But the pain didn't go away.  His testicles turned black.  And he could not achieve a full erection.  Oh, my God.  So there are people that want to kill this guy?  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  I remember when this guy first came out.  He looks familiar.  He was, like, doing the talk show circuits,  saying that he can make guys' penises bigger.  Now...  Oh, my God.  Imagine things twisting on you.  Another guy, his penis had...  It shrunk.  Immediately after surgery, the man thought the pain was excessive,  especially when he urinated. 
[02:54:00]  And most frightening, his penis had shrunk.  It had retracted inside my body, he said.  It didn't come out anymore.  I had to sit on the toilet like a girl.  And when I touched it, I felt nothing.  No pleasure, no pain.  He returned to Schwartz for corrective surgery  that resulted in some improvement in appearance.  His penis was slightly less retracted,  but not in sensation or sexual function.  The guy was just done.  Why would you do that?  I don't know. 
[02:54:30]  It doesn't matter.  Unless, I swear, unless every time you pull your pants down,  the girl just laughs uncontrollably.  And you're like, what the hell, I'll take the chance.  Yeah, I'll take the chance because it doesn't matter at this point.  Wow.  Yeah, the surgery is just...  I don't know.  You've got to be happy with yourself.  All right, great.  What's the Daily News doing a whole thing on doctors like this?  Yeah.  Katie, what's up?  Yeah, I was talking about you don't need to get the penis enlargement surgery. 
[02:55:00]  Why?  Because the girl can actually work it from the bottom.  Not enough, that actually extra part will come out during a sec.  I don't even know if that just made the radio.  Katie, you're trying to say that through a technique you could just get the penis longer.  Right, you don't.  What do you do?  You just squeeze real hard down there?  No, you don't squeeze.  You massage and you rub it. 
[02:55:30]  And you kind of like use your two fingers on the side between the man's sac and the buffalo.  And generally that extra inch will actually come out if you arouse it enough.  You have to arouse it.  It's not something that the penis will do by itself.  Oh, oh, oh, okay, terrific.  All right.  There's a book and a video available on it on how to do this without the man having to go through surgery. 
[02:56:00]  But, Katie, do you really need it that much longer?  No, not at all.  No, but some guys, you know, once in a while they want to try something different and they want to feel good about themselves.  Don't you ladies agree you don't need to hit the back wall as long as you're hitting the sides?  You're all right?  Absolutely.  And that's what I thought.  But I'm just saying for guys who want this, if they want to give it a try, if they're not happy with it, if they can talk to their meat, it does work.  All right.  Well, thank you, Katie.  Thank you.  It brings up a memory, Ant.  I went out with a girl that had like a deformed vag. 
[02:56:30]  And when we had sex, I would hit the back wall?  Yeah.  I felt like I was you.  Swear to you.  Really?  Yeah.  It was the most bizarre thing, man.  I would just pound the back wall.  Hoping was a black man.  The back wall.  I felt like a black guy, yeah.  It's called the cervix, Hoping.  Thank you.  Mike, what's up?  Look into it.  Hey, O&A.  Hey. 
[02:57:00]  What's up?  I want to talk to that chick.  Uh, Katie?  Yeah.  Why?  Well, she's right, man.  I measure about seven.  Yeah?  And, you know, I mean, it's always like a couple of two inches tucked underneath.  That you could get to make your thing longer?  Yeah.  I mean, you just, when you work at it and everything, you know that.  I got a feel down there.  You work, you work it and you're just fine.  Yeah, that's great.  You got, come on, you never done that? 
[02:57:30]  No, I never, like, I don't understand what you guys are doing.  You just push harder, that's all.  Right.  And all of a sudden, I mean, you're...  Does it really need to be that much longer?  I don't get it.  Why would you want your thing longer?  No, no.  Well, it's not a sexual procedure.  You go see a doctor for it.  I mean, when you're doing it, you know, I mean, when you masturbate or whatever, it's  probably only seven inches, but if you want a picture, two inches.  All right, Mike. 
[02:58:00]  No, you won't believe me.  No, I believe you.  Hey, bang hard, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  It works.  Thank you.  Hey, spaz is a...  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to hang up on you.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up?  Hey, my wife is a nurse, and she had this patient who was like a 70-some-odd-year-old  guy.  Yeah.  And he had that pump thing put into his schween.  Oh, really?  And she was there when the doctor first came in to demonstrate how this thing works.  And basically, it says, there's a little thing that hangs out of your leg that you have 
[02:58:30]  to pump.  Yeah.  And you pump it up.  But when you're done with it, you have to bend it to deflate it.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I was laughing my butt off when she told me this story.  Like trying to get air out of a balloon and stuff?  Exactly.  You got to bend it so it was complete.  Right.  Is that really how that works?  Yeah.  That's what she told me.  I mean, she's a nurse at a hospital.  At that point, why bother?  I mean, I guess it'll be like the hit of the nursing home pretty soon. 
[02:59:00]  So where's like the thing where he has to pump it up?  She said it was like coming out of like one of his legs.  It's like down on the other side of your thigh.  Yeah.  But how far down?  Well, I guess like middle or so.  She really didn't get that specific.  But she went down and she told all the other nurses she worked with and they were all cracking  up about it.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Glenn.  In the kitchen now.  All right.  Rick, what's up?  Yeah.  I think you could probably hook those up to your Reeboks and pump them up.  Yeah, right?  Pump up your stuff.

I know he's not selling it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, if you search for Nigger Charlie, it's like another one.  There's Nigger Charlie and it's silver, there's their back, so watch out.  Oh, I wonder if it's the sequel one.  I might have to get that one, too.  I have a collection going on your wall.  Yeah.  Okay, syndication eventually.  Yeah.  See, you're the smart one out of the bunch.  You have figured it out. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, eventually, someday.  I know.  All right, man.  Thank you.  RJ from Jersey.  I learned that OK Terrific is the funniest effing thing I've ever heard.

Psycho Mark's laughing.  I can hear him down the hall.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  Being an Irishman.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, we haven't heard many Amadou jokes.  I heard a bunch of people are emailing me.  Knock, knock.  You got to play long, Ed. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was looking at the eBay thing.  I'm going to have to...  You're going to get the other poster?  Wow.  Not a bad.  Very cheap.  And it is for the Soul of Nigger Charlie, the sequel.  So I'm going to have to get that.  It's got a picture of Fred Williamson as Nigger Charlie running with his six gun with, let's  see, one of his posse behind him with a bow and arrow and another one with a rifle.  Then it's got him just kill him whitey by the butt load.

I was listening to Radio Chick this afternoon, and Chuck was actually slamming on the bell. 
[03:08:00]  And someone came in with the instant feedback, and he said to leave Anthony's props alone.  Yes.  We'll just get a little worried if Radio Chick starts tooting on the gas fluid.  Take it easy, guys.  You guys rule.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  No one used the bell.  Frankie.  Hey, what's up?  What did you learn on the show today?

[03:10:00]  Yes.  This time, he'll be able to talk.  The last time he was in, no one knew he was here.  Yeah.  Jay Moore was here.  It was Jay Moore and Louis Black, and I think Louis Black said 10 words, so he's a very funny  guy.  We love when he stops by.  Yeah.  He gives the show a little class, Anthony.  And it really needs it.  I don't get this.  Reading?  Yeah, I'm reading.  Reading.  Don't mind the dead air.  It's the end of the show.  It happens.  Falling asleep now.
