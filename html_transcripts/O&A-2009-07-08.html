<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily focused on the Michael Jackson memorial service, utilizing frequent profanity and offensive humor throughout.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, along with in-studio guest Andrew ("Big A") and recurring guest Otto, dissected the event, criticizing various aspects with intense vulgarity.  Their commentary included scathing remarks about Mariah Carey's poor vocal performance (described with crude language),  Reverend Al Sharpton's allegedly opportunistic and racially divisive eulogy (mocked for its perceived nonsense and the use of the word "mess" instead of "message"), and Corey Feldman's appearance and purported emotional state.  They also commented on the perceived lack of genuine emotion from Michael Jackson's children, the excessive family involvement in managing Paris Jackson's speech (debated for its authenticity), and the notable absences of certain celebrities.  The empty coffin was also noted and discussed.  A caller from Connecticut contributed to the discussion surrounding Paris Jackson's speech.  The show also briefly touched on the missing brain of Albert Einstein.

The hosts' critique extended to Larry King, whose commentary on Sharpton's eulogy was deemed "racist, agenda-driven dreck," prompting a profanity-laced tirade and suggestions for his retirement.  They addressed a debunked viral video supposedly showing Michael Jackson's ghost. The segment incorporated audio clips from the memorial and news reports,  and featured Otto and George from "Otto and George" as guests, sharing their cynical perspectives on the memorial and Jackson. Brooke Shields' memorial anecdotes were also criticized for lacking humor.  A recurring comedic bit featuring "Jimsy" was played.  The commercial aspects surrounding the memorial, the upcoming coroner's report, and potential indictments related to Jackson's death were also discussed.  A news story about Michael Jackson's image appearing on a tree stump provided further comedic fodder.

The show incorporated tangents, including a discussion about the song "Smile," its melancholic undertones, and a possible story about Nat King Cole's television show being canceled due to a racial incident.  Conflicting accounts of pools being drained after Black performers swam in them, involving various celebrities like Sammy Davis Jr., Harry Belafonte, and Doris Day, were also mentioned.   A poorly received Michael Jackson tribute song featuring Diddy, Chris Brown, and Usher sparked further discussion and bets on the song's transition to a hip-hop beat.  Big Aâ€™s in-studio attempt to sing a Michael Jackson song was interrupted by the hosts' comedic riffing.  The show included promotional announcements for Otto's upcoming comedy shows and DVD, plugs for various businesses (including a taxi service), and a discussion of Opie's new Mustang and his enthusiasm for fast driving, potentially involving a trip to Englishtown Raceway Park. Opie also mentioned meeting Anthony Michael Hall for lunch.  The broadcast consistently employed vulgar language and made numerous crude and offensive jokes throughout all segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  This is your Michael Jackson Memorial Station.  Actually, we're keeping it real.  Like Reverend Al, keeping it real.  Jesus Christ.  Where do we begin with that dog and pony show that everyone saw?  Yeah, they're estimating, you know, billions watched it around the world. 
[00:00:30]  CNN's feed online alone.  I was watching that.  Ten million people.  Ten million watching that.  No, no, no, no.  Ten million only on their online feed.  I know.  That's just one piece of a very big puzzle.  Yeah.  The world watched this event last night.  Did you see the feed from Germany?  No.  Where it was an arena full of people watching it on big screens in the middle of a goddamn coliseum. 
[00:01:00]  All right.  All right.  He's more famous than Ali.  Fuck everybody.  Yeah.  It's about time, Jimmy.  God damn all of you.  Whole fucking world.  I get it.  Go F yourselves.  I guess we're going to have to just jump around because it's just way too much.  You can't organize this shit.  So we're just going to jump in.  Yeah.  We're already arguing about Paris's speech at the end of the memorial. 
[00:01:30]  Can we at least go around the room before you rant and rave, please?  Oh, please.  All right.  Feel free.  I was having a lot of fun watching this thing.  I was goofing.  I was tweeting.  And then that little girl got on stage and said what she said.  And I thought it was genuine and I had a bit of a teary eyeball situation.  Yeah.  Not an actual tear, you know, going down my face or anything.  But I was like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Made this weirdo into a human being.  That was my thought. 
[00:02:00]  Ugh.  This weirdo into a human being.  Jimmy.  I didn't watch any of the tribute stuff.  I saw her speech.  Why would you?  I'm not interested, to be honest with you.  It was a sad send-off.  How about it be interesting because we do a radio show?  Well, I can kind of catch on.  I don't give a fuck.  I can wing it.  That's what I do.  Jimmy's pretty good at picking up on things.  Whatever's going on, you know what?  I'll talk.  I'm not going to sit here and go, who?  What happened?  Yeah, just all clueless.  Yeah.  You can figure it out.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  I felt her moment.  The reason I felt it was-  But you saw her moment?  Of course, yeah.  Okay, see?  So you did watch.  I felt it was a genuine thing, just only because of her age.  Nope.  I'll tell you why.  Oh, sorry.  It's not my turn yet.  No, no, no.  No, it's not my turn.  Ed doesn't agree 100%.  No, it's not.  Right.  But because she was raised in that cocoon.  She's not an outside person going, let me look good at the memorial.  She knows this guy who we all think is a fucking whack job, but she knows him as dad.  That's how she knows him. 
[00:03:00]  So I do kind of believe it.  Um, we're looking at the whole family as a whole, all these weirdos and all this weird  shit, but she's just somebody who's just, she knows him.  He was normal to her.  Oh, you think?  Yeah, man.  She was raised, she was raised walking around with a veil on her face like he was.  That was where she lived.  She didn't know any better.  And the reason why he was the greatest daddy of all time is because, you know, they were  flying private jets all over the world and he was buying her whatever the hell she wanted.  And I'm sure she didn't have a, have to do homework or, or go to bed at any specific 
[00:03:30]  time.  She had the run of the joint.  Or a loan.  Well, she was treated like probably royalty wherever she went.  And again, for her, that was normal though.  For us going into that world to be like, well, all right, what can I say to look good about  Michael?  Because I'm from, you know, but for her, that was his life as it was supposed to be.  Can we hear the speech first?  Oh, hey, let her rip.  I just wanted to say, sweetheart, speak up.  Oh my God.  Ever since I was born. 
[00:04:00]  That's allowed.  That's allowed.  Hatched.  Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine.  So the dermatologist.  And I just wanted to say I love him so much.  Yeah.  And there you go.  The other weird thing about this is Michael Jackson tried to protect her from the media  and the paparazzi and all that.  Those lousy 30 seconds just made her the most famous person on earth. 
[00:04:30]  The most famous person on earth.  On earth.  On earth.  You're right.  For now, today, she is the most famous person on earth.  After Ali.  She's everywhere.  After Ali.  You're not fucking making Ali third to Michael and then her.  I'm not accepting that.  Cover of every newspaper.  She's the most famous person today.  Front page on every website.  Tomorrow she'll start dropping down in the ranks.  But today, there's no one more famous than this little girl.  And Michael Jackson was so trying to, like, I don't know what he was trying to do. 
[00:05:00]  I think he was just playing up to the whole paparazzi and a freak thing.  But there you go.  His daughter is now the most famous person in the world.  Here's.  And she's fucking beautiful.  Here's.  That one's going to be a looker when she gets old.  Oof.  Yeah.  With Jackson money.  With Jackson money on top of it.  Right.  Here's my take on the whole thing.  Staged.  Every aspect of that memorial. 
[00:05:30]  No.  The whole thing.  Oh.  I think it was a.  Every aspect of it was choreographed.  I've never seen a funeral choreographed like that.  Where people are doing Ring Around the Rosie around the fat fucking American Idol chick.  Jennifer Hudson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're doing Ring Around the Rosie.  Singing Feed Me, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Feed me.  Feed me.  Feed me.  I don't think we need to anymore.  And actually, that was a Willie song.  Was it?  Didn't Michael Jackson write that song for Free Willy or something? 
[00:06:00]  Which makes it kind of funny because she's a whale singing about a whale.  Okay.  Anyway.  But now this Paris thing.  Yeah.  She gets up there.  The first thing you notice, it is.  Now you listen to that audio clip and you're like, oh my God, there's an upset girl.  You watch it.  It's a whole different story.  The entire Jackson family.  There were more fucking silver sequined gloves trying to roadie that microphone for her while  she's crying. 
[00:06:30]  Well, they were all wearing the glove, you know, for Michael.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that was their thing.  But they're straightening out her microphone, making sure that what she, well, as she's crying  that it's heard.  Come on.  Get that mic in your face.  Well, they don't know any better.  They're entertainers.  Not, not a speck of a tear, not a speck of water coming out of that girl's eye.  I saw some glazed over eyes.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't.  I didn't. 
[00:07:00]  Sorry.  See, I think you got to talk about Michael Jr. and Blanket when you want to talk about  not having emotions.  I'm not done with Paris yet.  I think Paris was legit.  Nope.  That is a showbiz family from top to bottom, has been for their entire lives, been show  business.  And if you think it stopped with Michael, it didn't.  His kids, it's the same thing.  And I think she was coached, told what to do to drag out this emotion at the end, to humanize 
[00:07:30]  this guy.  And it worked.  The wool got pulled over everyone's eyes.  But that's what I think.  I think she was used for that gain, to make him look like more of a human being, like  Daddy.  Meanwhile, Daddy?  What?  Who?  That guy?  Yeah.  And then the son, Michael, Prince Michael II, whatever. 
[00:08:00]  He looked like he could give a flying fuck to be there.  Well, he was chewing his gum and he was bored.  He was kind of slouching in his chair, chewing gum the whole time, just like, and then there'd  be a standing ovation.  He'd kind of look around and went, if enough people stood up, he'd stand up.  He looked like, just end this, give me my trust fund and get me the fuck out of here.  That's what he looked like.  That I agree with.  And yeah.  Paris, I think it's a whole different thing because she's a girl. 
[00:08:30]  She doesn't have the boy part, so I think she had actually a real relationship with  her father.  There are, people can speculate what might have happened with a young boy that was not  a blood relative to Michael Jackson.  You know, who knows if he bred his own play toys.  I don't know.  It's just a little odd to me.  That's all.  A little odd.  And Blanket was just scared to be in sunlight.  A little scaredy cat Blanket.  Oh my God.  Maybe a kid Blanket. 
[00:09:00]  He was petrified to be in front of human beings and sunlight.  Yeah.  Little Blanket.  Look at that.  They're little kids.  The kids.  So you reckon the Paris moment for everybody?  You reckon the Paris moment?  I reckon it.  You're not reckon it.  Just a little too much.  Did you feel like you started having some kind of emotion and scared you?  So you decided to go the other way?  No, I watched this thing twice all the way through.  I didn't have any real human emotions. 
[00:09:30]  The only one was with the Paris thing.  That was it, though.  The rest of it was horse shit.  It was a dog and pony show.  A lot of people didn't show up because they have reputations they still worry about.  Where was Quincy Jones?  Where was Diana Ross?  Where was Dionne Warwick on that stage?  Where were these people?  Who were the people that were on the stage?  Yeah.  Who were they?  Yeah, some of them are my friends.  Who was the googly-eyed guy that was singing We Are the World that scared the shit out of all of us?  He was a creep. 
[00:10:00]  You see that guy?  Yes.  Who was he?  I don't know.  How about you tell us who these people are?  I don't know.  It was supposed to be the big send-off at the end of the memorial, and everyone was supposed to sing We Are the World,  and it was just a bunch of hack backup singers on stage.  Yeah.  That's who those people were.  Look at that guy.  Wow.  Look at the googly-eyed guy.  Chocolate green.  Right.  Wow.  He looks like a burn victim.  Yeah.  He's just rawr.  Googly-eyed.  And there was no sincerity throughout the whole thing, for the most part. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  For the most part.  I mean, you could argue the Paris thing.  Fine.  You got your opinion.  I got mine.  That's fine.  But, I mean, we could agree that Mariah Carey, she could give a shit.  I saw her sing.  Did she not sing particularly well?  She was horrible.  She couldn't hit any of the notes.  Her pipes are gone.  Yeah, it seemed like you were.  I mean, if you remember what that song sounded like when she originally sang it,  and I've even heard her do it live, not at a concert, it's on television. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this the original?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell right off the bat.  Yeah.  This wasn't from last night.  And she did it lower, and she couldn't do her little trills.  That she's trying to pull out of thin air with her fingers.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  It's like, where's my note?  I got to find it in the air.  She tries to grab the high notes from heaven.  So, yeah, she sounded like shit.  What a set of knockers on her, huh?  This is her song or Michael's?  No, it's mine.  This is Michael's.  Jackson 5, actually, originally.  That was an appropriate dress for her to wear at a fucking dead guy's fucking memorial service. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  With your tit meat hanging out.  Her giant tit meat.  Fake tit meat.  Fake tit meat.  She had horrendous tits before she got a boob job.  Horrendous.  Oh.  So, she was, I don't know.  I don't know.  It was just people coming on stage and singing a song.  That was it.  There was no real emotion behind it.  No.  Most of these people had memories of Michael Jackson from 30 years ago.  No one has seen the guy in two decades, most likely. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  When was the last time Brooke Shields saw Michael Jackson?  She, the only humorous anecdotes she had were from when she was 13 years old.  13.  Which, you know, when she said, me and Michael used to hang out when I was 13.  Do we have her from last night singing?  Do we have the, oh, you want to hear the difference?  Yeah, just the difference.  Yeah, we can get that from down the hall.  Uh, uh, hold on.  Someone agrees with you with the Paris thing.  Let's go to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Welcome aboard, Matt.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah, you know, I saw that, that Paris thing last night and I was just listening to it.  It was almost like when a kid tries to cry too hard, they force it a little bit.  They squeeze a little too hard in the eye.  I mean, sure, she lost her, lost her so-called dad, but, you know, I just don't, I didn't see  the emotion in it.  So-called is right.  Wow.  I disagree.  It's hard to say, dude.  I'd be more likely to definitely agree with you if she was 17.  People are a little bit more aware, but it's like when you're raised in that fucking bubble. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, because Michael, Michael never put on an act or anything when he was nine years old  on the Ed Sullivan show.  That's true.  Yeah, never put on an act.  He wasn't raised in a family.  He was.  But these kids were isolated.  But these kids were isolated for their whole lives and that's a tough spot to all of a sudden,  you know, pull off the fake acting crying thing.  Sure, but the hardest part of the whole situation was just the Jackson family.  They were like pushing her right in front and all of a sudden it was just like she's done  crying and boom, we're out, you know?  Well, dude, how awkward that Michael, like him or dislike him, the guy is an icon and the 
[00:13:30]  star of the show is an 11-year-old white girl.  Yeah.  It's just bizarre for the family.  It's insane that all of a sudden they're being comforted by the Jacksons, the Jackson  family, and they're, you know, little white children who have not, nary a strand of DNA  from the Jacksons.  I was flipping through and I saw them all touching the girl.  I said, call the police.  They're bothering her. 
[00:14:00]  But you know what, though?  Like Madonna's got natural kids do.  But if you look at the little, she's adopting Black Hits Mavericka and they're looking at  as her kids.  Tom Cruise has adopted kids and looked at as his kids.  So I guess I get it.  There's a lot of people that are adopted out there, Ant, that, you know.  I understand.  They look at their mommy and daddies as their mommy and daddy.  They don't wrap them up in sheets and dangle them over balconies.  Well, I feel sorry for Blanket.  I mean, that kid is scared to be alive.  Little Blanket is just.  He's trying to find the lab he was born in.  Quite so he could have some kind of sense of everything. 
[00:14:30]  And what about Stevie Wonder?  To the people out there that do that cornrow shit.  Yeah.  You got to stop because you're going to end up looking like Stevie Wonder eventually.  Did you notice that there was still some left sort of on the side?  Yeah, there's like some fuzzes.  He's been pulling that hair back so tightly for so many years that he just yanked his own  hair out of his head.  But he doesn't care.  What does he care?  It is the strangest.  Looks in the mirror in the morning.  It's the strangest hairline I've ever seen, though.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  It is bizarre.  The strangest hairline he's never seen.  Well, he said, did you hear his line?  I hope, what did he say?  I was hoping I would never see this day.  Oh.  Well, Stevie, come on.  You didn't.  You never saw that thing.  Did anybody else get douche chills looking at pictures of Corey Feldman?  Oh.  Oh, he dressed up as Michael Jackson for the memorial.  Dude.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, he used to do that, Jimmy.  I know he did.  When he was, you know, 10.  I understand that.  You do, right?  However, he's no longer 10. 
[00:15:30]  It's not cute.  He's got to be pushing 40.  What are you doing?  It's not moving.  No.  Yeah.  Now, that's who we should be attacking this morning.  I agree.  Corey Feldman.  Corey Feldman's a douche.  Let's make a list of who's a douche and who's not.  We'll keep Paris in the middle.  I can't give you a, I can't put her totally in the douche category yet.  No, I'm not.  I need a little more evidence in.  I'm not even putting her in the douche category.  I'm just saying there was coaching going on.  I think that was supposed to be the grand finale, which it was.  That was the moment that is on the cover of all the newspapers. 
[00:16:00]  That is the sound bite.  That is the video clip.  So I think, and why is it such a stretch to believe that the Jacksons choreographed this  entire thing from beginning to end, which they did.  Usher coming down the stairs of the stage and singing to the empty coffin.  Empty.  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  Empty.  Michael Jackson's body was not in that coffin.  It was not in that Coors Light can.  Yeah, don't even kid yourself. 
[00:16:30]  No.  That body was somewhere else.  Gone.  That was, that was, you're so right.  That was an empty coffin.  Yes.  For some reason, they didn't want to take the chance of having Michael Jackson's actual  body at the Staples Center.  They're handling his remains like he's King Tut or something.  Yep.  Don't they understand what the coroner did to that body after he died?  They're still studying his brain somewhere.  I know.  So bring the body to the Staples Center.  It's no big deal.  We were actually, I was on Red Eye last night and Michael Bodden was the, Dr. Bodden was  the interview talking about the brain, about Michael's brain. 
[00:17:00]  And he said, uh, it's very common for the brain not to be with, uh, the body.  Yeah.  People don't, a lot of families don't know that, but it's like a toxicology report.  A lot of times.  Usually after death.  What's Steve C's, uh, excuse me?  Well, do you know what happened?  They tried to put a logo on it and the stem broke.  No, he said that what happens is, uh, the brain is taken and he goes, a lot of religious  people want the brain put in, so you'll have to exhume the body and put it in.  Yeah.  But if not, it's respectfully, uh, cremated is what will happen.  Oh, really?  A lot of it.  But it depends on the family.  You know, the Jacksons need money. 
[00:17:30]  I would, I would so buy Michael Jackson's brain.  You think, could you imagine having that?  You can't sell his brain.  Could you imagine having that in your apartment?  Brains.  What a conversation starter that would be.  It certainly would be.  How cool would that be?  Well, do you know whose brain disappeared?  Very famous man.  His brain disappeared for 40 years.  Um, uh, Beethoven.  No.  Um.  JFK.  Um, no.  Apparently there was a private ceremony later.  Fuck, I know this fucking trivia question.  They think it was put in the body by Robert, in the, in the casket with Robert, by Robert 
[00:18:00]  then.  Oh, right.  It was Einstein.  Really?  I knew that.  But his brain disappeared, and they found it 40 years later.  Some, uh, I guess, coroner or somebody in Minnesota had it, and he had kept it, and  he wanted to see if it was any different than any other human brain.  And he didn't know anyone was looking for it?  I'm sure he did, but he just wanted to study it, and, uh, I don't know how, how he didn't  get caught, but he said there was no difference between that and any other brain he had studied.  Um, wow, and you got the phones lit with your Paris thing. 
[00:18:30]  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Oh, screw.  Chris.  What's going on, brother?  Hey, man.  Hey, bro, this is the way I'm looking at the whole thing.  This is the first time we saw this kid ever, besides being, uh, masked.  Right.  And I just think he's a little wrong by fucking opening up on it, Jake, man.  She's a fucking kid, dude.  Yeah, so what?  So what?  That doesn't mean this whole, that whole friggin' debacle of, of a tribute wasn't, uh, choreographed. 
[00:19:00]  And that she wasn't, but it was a fucking, it was a carnival show, bro, 100%.  Dude, like, where were these people, like, the day before he died?  Like, he wasn't really, uh, you know.  They're in a fucking arena with people yelling, we love you, Michael, to a box.  An empty box.  The whole thing was a circus.  Dude, I agree it was a fucking circus.  Yeah, but why does the Paris thing make you so angry?  It doesn't make me angry.  It's just, people, um, just take it at face value. 
[00:19:30]  I'm looking at it going, if you, if you look at that clip, look at how many Jackson hands  are getting in, trying to get that mic right in her face.  Oh, yeah, because they understand.  Yeah, it looked like they were, they were climbing on top of the baseball bat, trying  to see who wins it.  Exactly.  I think there's two things going on here.  Uh, I think Paris was really having a moment.  But I think the Jackson family understands how to really capitalize on a moment and go,  holy crap, this could be good for, for us.  Let's make sure the microphone's right in front of her face so everyone hears this moment 
[00:20:00]  that she's having.  I don't even.  I agree with that part.  I don't even know if they're, if they're choreographing it.  Like, I don't, the, the Jacksons are in, are so fucking famous.  Everything they do gets pressed.  They're so used to it.  But everything they do is calculated.  I think it's almost an instinct to fix someone's mic.  I would do that.  You just, you hear someone can't be heard.  You just fix, you just adjust.  It's, it's something you can do in a, in a, in an awkward moment.  You adjust the mic.  It's like, what can you do?  Uh, I, I, I, I think they were. 
[00:20:30]  You're looking for that big closer.  The big opener was when they brought the box out.  The big closer.  Nope.  The big opener was, uh, who was it?  Smokey Robinson.  Pretty much reading letters from all the, uh, pretty much reading letters from all the  people that were too scared to go to the Staples Center because they got reputations still.  Any, you see any tears there in your slow motion replay, Danny?  I don't see one little freak.  I don't see a drop.  We get it.  Not a drop.  The little girl didn't cry.  I want to see a video of the sun. 
[00:21:00]  She's the best, she's the best actress in the world today.  All right.  She goes, okay.  It just makes you angry though.  It's like, why does it make you angry?  Because everyone's buying up this shit.  I think there's some deeper though.  I don't buying up this shit.  I think when it comes to human emotions, it just bothers you to a point that you have  to be angry so no one sees the real land or something.  And Reverend, uh, all right.  Or nothing.  No, no, no.  I, I, I just, Reverend Frederick Douglass Sharpton. 
[00:21:30]  Well, boy, is he going for that look with the hair now?  Frederick Douglass look.  You see it?  It's the gray hair and now it's sweeping back.  He's never going to cut it.  All right.  He's going to turn into Frederick Douglass.  We're going to agree to disagree on the Paris thing.  Okay.  But man, am I all in with the Reverend Al horse shit.  Reverend Al.  The Reverend Al horse shit.  This, this opportunist.  I mean, we've said it all.  Oh, yes.  By the way.  Oh. 
[00:22:00]  Did we call it or not?  Our, uh, Reverend Al rant from yesterday is front and center on Breitbart, my friends.  Oh, is it?  Fuck yeah, it is.  Nice.  Hopefully, uh, Jimmy's in on that rant.  Which, which rant is that?  The Reverend Al thing from yesterday made Breitbart.  Oh, did it?  Hell fucking yeah.  How long was the Breitbart rant?  30 something minutes.  That was cut down from like over an hour.  Did I get, am I in on this one?  I'm hoping.  I hope so.  I hope Jimmy said something.  I yelled my name a couple of times.  Yes, you did.  I hope Jim Norton made it.  Is it on there?  Yay. 
[00:22:30]  So, Reverend.  Do I sound smart or stupid?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  We can get your parts to see.  Reverend Al, so, you know, has turned this into a publicity tour for himself.  He certainly did.  That is very obvious to everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, the other thing I do want to mention, and I need to know where you guys  are at with this too.  So, I watched the memorial for literally three hours.  That's all I did yesterday.  And I'm, I'm laughing and I'm like, this is horse shit.  This is a dog and pony show.  I couldn't wait to go to Fox, MSNBC, and CNN, the biggies. 
[00:23:00]  I'm like, they have to be somehow goofing on this.  They have to.  Yeah.  And I turn it on.  It's like, that was the most beautiful send off ever.  Reverend Al brought the house down.  He was brilliant tonight.  This and that.  All just, all just kiss asses.  Insane.  And then I was convinced that I have to be an alien.  Yeah.  Because I have no concept to live in that world like they do, where they, they saw it  so differently than me.  I, I, I couldn't, I couldn't understand it.  Yeah.  No one wanted to call out that, that there was no sincerity, that Michael Jackson's really 
[00:23:30]  close friends avoided that place like the plague, you know?  Most of the people that were on stage trying to talk about it were, haven't seen Michael  in decades.  Fucking Magic Johnson says that he was a better basketball player because of Michael Jackson  and no one comments on that, on the news?  He saw, he said he saw Michael Jackson perform and, uh, it just made him a better basketball  player.  Why?  What?  What the fuck?  Maybe because he said, I didn't want to be anything like that little bitch. 
[00:24:00]  So I manned up and hit the gym and fucking began working out harder.  Has Magic Johnson ever been seen with a woman?  He's married.  Cookie.  He's watching his cookie.  Really?  Yeah.  He's married.  Where's she been for the last 20 years?  Well, I mean, I'm, he, I don't know if he did other stuff, but he's definitely married.  But another thing I was saying, boy, you just never, ever thought you'd see Magic Johnson  at a memorial service for Michael Jackson back, you know, when Michael Jackson was putting 
[00:24:30]  out hits and Magic Johnson was diagnosed with AIDS.  It was like, wow.  Right.  All right.  I'll bet you any amount of money.  Yeah.  But.  And they're about the same age, right?  There's a long shot.  Magic's got to be pushing 50 this morning.  He has to be.  He absolutely has to be 50.  He's got to be.  Because I think he was a couple of years older than Michael and Michael's, uh, Michael  Jordan, of course.  Michael Jordan, I think is 45, 46.  How do you get fatter with AIDS?  Magic is amazingly healthy guy.  He's a giant man.  Imagine without AIDS.  He's having a little trouble.  I think he's got some knee troubles. 
[00:25:00]  They all do, though.  He was walking up those stairs and he was like, uh, uh, uh, uh, they all do.  He, uh, yeah, he's fucking, uh, they said he stopped taking his cocktail a few times.  Like, he had convinced himself, like, cause he's such a healthy dude that he, that he  was okay.  And then he started getting a little sicker and then he had to keep taking it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, damn.  No.  What year did he, I remember the, the Newsweek cover when Magic announced he had, was HIV  positive.  1968.  It said, even me.  And it had him, it was a great cover.  It was a silhouette of him holding a basketball.  Uh, it was either Time or Newsweek or Sports Illustrated. 
[00:25:30]  It was a fucking great cover, but that, I was dating this girl, Tina, at the time.  That's gotta be 20 fucking years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Easy.  Or 88.  Yeah, it's 20 years ago.  I've been living with the, the HIV.  Did you hear the commentators after the thing?  And were you just like, stupefied?  Like, are you kidding me?  Why, why isn't anyone seeing it my way?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we all are like that.  Whatever you believe in, you want everyone else to see it your way.  You know, that's, that's pretty much being a human being.  But they were so much different than what I saw.  I, I, I, I couldn't believe it. 
[00:26:00]  Because the second you criticize anything, uh, you get, uh, calls, um, and, and people  like, like what I'm getting.  So they just take the easy route and go, yeah, that was horrible.  Blah, blah, blah.  And, uh.  No, we're disagreeing on that.  But the overall feel of the thing was ridiculous.  Yeah.  And it was so obvious it was ridiculous.  It's like an award show.  You could pick apart the individual performances of everybody, of course, and have some disagreements.  But, uh, talking about this thing as a, as a whole, as an event, it, it's unbelievable 
[00:26:30]  how stupid it was.  Yeah.  It was, it was.  One guy on CNN, and I, I gotta give him credit.  He's like, what?  Because they were praising Reverend Allen.  He was like, right in front of everyone.  Like, what are you talking, this guy, it, it, it is, it is documented that he slept with  children.  No, this is not okay.  Yeah.  And Reverend Allen is wrong what he said.  Yeah.  One guy.  One white guy.  Actually, uh, said that on the news.  Wow.  Good.  Good for him.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to do the Reverend Allen? 
[00:27:00]  That's going to be a biggie.  Yeah.  How about we save the Reverend Allen?  Because we're heading toward a break.  We'll do a few more phones.  All right.  Yeah.  I, I, I, I.  Because I think we need to clear the field for this stupid Reverend Allen.  This opportunist.  This publicity whore.  I went through the Reverend Allen speech a couple of times.  And I think I stopped it probably 20 times.  Oh, easily.  Easily.  It was just.  Was it inspirational, Ant?  Yes.  It was very inspirational.  Were you getting choked up?  Yeah.  That's what it was.  Can you do it for the big show today? 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  I heard you, you were fantastic, but let's do it for the big show.  No, no, I, I swear.  We have a big show.  We got a lot of people listening.  That's what I do.  All right.  Good.  Now I'm all, see, now I got my ideas all there.  So you were practicing.  I say the same, I say the same shit.  You were practicing.  That's right.  It's game time.  I'm revved up now.  I was swinging the bat in the batter's box there.  And this is what we do on the show, which is very different than other radio shows.  We're going right down the line from one through nine right now.  You know, we don't control the direction of the show where we want to make our points. 
[00:28:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We just hit the phones and let it fly.  Let's start with.  Let the praise fly.  Let's start with Josh in Philly.  Josh.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Anthony, I got to agree with you.  There were no tears there whatsoever.  And I think it's a blessing that she is now away from that thing.  You know what?  I agree with that, too.  I agree.  This is the best thing that could happen to these kids.  They have a chance at some kind of normalcy because they'll still be under the whole Jackson umbrella. 
[00:28:30]  Exactly.  They'll be out of that family and away from him.  Could you imagine how he would raise those kids in that house?  You know, you see the older Jackson boys on that stage, and they seem relatively normal.  Yeah.  They did.  Jermaine, not so much.  That fucking LaToya freak, not so much.  And a few of them, no way.  But there were some of the older brothers that looked like just normal, older dudes going, what the fuck? 
[00:29:00]  You know?  Yeah.  And it's almost like they have a few things to say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But.  I agree.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Josh agrees with Ann on the Paris thing.  Let's go with Rob in Michigan.  Rob.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  What about that Jermaine with the black shoe polish haircut?  Had his glove on the wrong hand.  His glove on the wrong hand?  Yeah.  Really?  Yes, he did.  He is shoe polishing the side of his head. 
[00:29:30]  I noticed that, too.  Shoe polish.  Well, I don't know what it's called officially, but it's some kind of hair product.  A little too much.  Yeah.  A little too much.  I'm sorry.  Didn't a few of them have it on left hand?  I'm guessing it was a pallbearer thing.  Didn't some have right, some have left?  Oh, maybe.  I'll look at you just in a photo.  That makes sense.  Jermaine had it on.  That's one, two, three left.  One, two right.  And I don't know who the last one would have been.  It looks like that's probably pallbearer.  And let me tell you something about Jermaine Jackson.  Stupidest man alive. 
[00:30:00]  Paris, most famous person in the world today.  Jermaine Jackson, the stupidest man alive.  Because he sang that song, Smile.  Yeah.  I guess Charlie Chaplin made it famous.  Did Charlie Chaplin write it?  Didn't make the mustache famous.  That was another guy.  I'm not sure if Charlie Chaplin wrote the song, but Smile is a very, very old song that a lot of people have done.  And I think it might have originated with Charlie Chaplin.  Okay.  There's a very famous version of it by Nat King Cole. 
[00:30:30]  Jermaine Jackson decides he's going to sing Smile at this memorial.  It was Michael Jackson's favorite song of all time.  Okay.  So they knew well in advance that they were going to sing this song.  And it's Michael Jackson's favorite song of all time.  This Jermaine Jackson hasn't had a fucking hit in over 25 years.  My girl and a million other people last night were searching out the Smile song on iTunes.  Really?  That was a quick fucking million dollars for Jermaine Jackson.  Guess what? 
[00:31:00]  There wasn't a Jermaine Jackson version of Smile.  I would have went into a fucking studio and recorded it and threw it up on iTunes.  He would have got at least a million downloads.  There you go.  At least.  Do we have that at all?  I didn't see that.  At least.  Yeah, we're going to get to that as well.  Now, the dumbest guy alive.  And don't say he was too busy mourning over Michael Jackson.  No.  He was another guy whoring himself out to all the media outlets.  He couldn't get in front of â€“ he was pushing people out of the way to get on camera to talk about his brother. 
[00:31:30]  But the one thing he could have done for himself, he blew it.  Blew it!  He blew it!  There was a million versions of Smile on iTunes.  A million.  But everyone was like, well, I want that Jermaine Jackson one because it was the moment of the memorial.  They could relate to it.  Blah, blah, blah.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nowhere to be found.  No way, no how.  Dave in North Dakota.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I love your show.  Hey, I was looking on MSN.  It shows that last time Brooke Shields saw Michael Jackson was 1991 at Elizabeth Taylor's wedding. 
[00:32:00]  There you go.  And she was the one that they drag out as â€“  There you go.  Where was Webster?  Where was Webster who was perched on his lap like fucking George on Otto's lap?  Uh, during an awards show.  Where was he?  And also, uh, Macaulay Culkin?  Yeah.  They all hit.  Something tells me they weren't busy.  No.  They weren't busy.  They were having a zippity-doo-dah party somewhere.  They probably didn't want to deal with the questions or the implications or TMZ or anybody who's, you know â€“ 
[00:32:30]  Oh, well, did you see at the end of the show the Michael Jackson smorgasbord they put up on the stage when all the kids came out?  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that a little like just â€“  That was a little like â€“  I watched that one.  I was just like, ugh.  Yeah, I didn't like that either.  They just parade the children out.  But Brooke â€“  This is what he preyed upon.  Brooke Shields, yeah, pouring her soul out.  And my first thought was, well, where were you the last 10, 15 years?  Yeah.  This guy obviously had some major problems and some major issues. 
[00:33:00]  Where were you?  Did you try, at least?  Did you try to, you know, help him out?  Because it's going to come out that there were a shitload of drugs in the sky.  She was busy duking it out with Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise, yeah.  Saying her postpartum depression was bunk and she'd put a straw hat.  All right, good point, Tom.  You got the answers.  Yeah, but I mean â€“  He's so glib.  But 18 years ago you saw him and you're up there like you had lunch with him a week ago.  Yeah.  You know, shut up.  You're right, Dave. 
[00:33:30]  She's busy for kids away from Neverland Ranch.  You're right, Dave.  Thank you, sir.  You bet.  Thank you, guys.  Let's say how to â€“ Big T in New York.  Big T.  Good morning, man.  Hey.  What irked me more â€“ first of all, I agree with Anthony 100%.  That's number one.  Number two, when they were all huddled around her when she was giving the speech, like right  before she spoke, all you see in the background is Jesse Jackson floating around, kissing  this one, kissing that one, sticking his head in front of the camera, grabbing this person's  arm. 
[00:34:00]  He's floating around trying to suck up that camera.  He's a scumbag.  Big T, I'm so glad you noticed that because, you know, the Jackson family was like showing  whether it's real or not emotions on that stage.  People were sad and there were some tears.  And if you looked closely in the back like Big T did, fucking Jesse Jackson looked like  he was at like a political rally.  Yeah, of course.  He was like â€“ no clue of the emotion that was actually happening on that stage.  It was a great opportunity for a lot of people to get their face on television and be relevant 
[00:34:30]  for a day.  In front of a billion people.  Jesse Jackson and the Reverend Al especially getting up there with his fake sincerity.  And then I got to tell you something.  That Martin Luther King, Jr., Jr.?  What is it?  The third.  Does he lack the spark of Martin Luther King?  I agree.  Martin Luther King could get up there and motivate. 
[00:35:00]  And the way he spoke, he held a crowd.  He was able â€“ what a snooze fest.  It looked like George and Wheezy up there.  I guess what are they?  Is it the son or the grandson?  The grandson â€“ what is it?  Granddaughter?  No, it's the third son.  So that's the â€“  That's got to be the grandson.  That's the grandson.  Oh, wait.  But Martin Luther King, Jr. was a junior.  So Martin Luther King, the third.  That's not his son.  Was it his son or his â€“  Well, he was assassinated in 63 or 68. 
[00:35:30]  It would have to be his â€“  Yeah, well, that's 40 years ago.  So maybe the kid was born in 1960.  All right.  So I'm guessing â€“  It's his son.  It's his son.  That is his son.  Martin Luther King â€“ if Martin Luther King was whole milk,  that kid was like skimmed on top.  Lactaid.  He gets up there and he's trying to kind of do â€“  you know, get that spark in his speaking.  And wow, what a dullard.  What a dullard.  Another thing I agree with.  Another thing I agree with. 
[00:36:00]  See, no one had this graphic up.  Reverend Al Sharpton.  Racist, lying sack of shit jack off.  You had that up?  Well, someone did.  I was watching â€“ I was going through a lot of different channels, Opie.  And one of them was Rev Al Sharpton, racist, lying sack of shit jack off.  How funny would it be if Fox put that graphic up  and O'Reilly was calling him a jack off sack of shit?  Oh, my God.  Or Hannity.  Can you picture Hannity saying it? 
[00:36:30]  This cum bucket.  Do you believe it?  Lying, jack off sack of shit.  Let's go to Christy in North Carolina.  Christy.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  So, I'm with Ant on this whole Paris thing.  How much time do these kids spend from day to day with their father?  I mean â€“  She didn't know any better.  I understand that she probably wasn't with Michael Jackson a lot,  but she didn't know any better.  In her dumb little world, that was her father.  Simple as that.  And every time you saw them, they were filmed.  Like, you really didn't see him.  You saw him filmed a lot with his kids. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  She probably assumed that this is, you know, what a father is, you know,  a doped-up guy that has an anesthesiologist running after him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That probably accounts for about five minutes of their â€“  five percent of their entire, you know, life with the man.  I'm not â€“ I wasn't saying she wasn't, like, attached to the guy or, you know,  thought of him as a father or whatever.  I don't know.  But the thing is, I don't know the ifs, ands, buts, befores, or afters.  All I know is when I saw that, some red flags went up. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  I was just thinking, ah.  And knowing the Jackson family throughout their history, everything,  that Joe Jackson doesn't leave shit to chance.  He choreographs everything.  Did you see the Ring Around the Rosie dance with Fatty?  Yes, I did.  From American Idol?  Yes, I did.  He choreographed the Ring Around the Rosie dance.  Because it was a song from Free Willy.  So, you know, they were trying to free Jennifer Hudson.  Free Jennifer Hudson.  From her calorie problem. 
[00:38:00]  Did anyone catch Jermaine Jackson's comment about how I've been Michael's voice and backbone?  Oh, yeah, I did.  Oh.  Yeah, he wanted to make it clear to everybody, look, now I'm the man.  Yeah.  I'm the man.  It's not about him anymore.  Well, the dope didn't record Smile before he sang it on that stage.  I can't tell you how stupid that really is.  Because everyone was searching it out last night.  And I bet you, I bet you within a week there will be a version of that available on iTunes.  In a way, it's going to be too late.  By the way, Jermaine Jackson, pay me. 
[00:38:30]  I just consulted you.  Oh, consulting fee.  Pay me.  Why don't you hear the song?  We're going to get to it, Jermaine.  Where is it?  Tony in New York.  Tony.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You know what, to your point, where were the people that were relevant to this guy in  his life?  John Mayer?  I mean, Usher, maybe.  Yeah, exactly.  John Mayer gets out there.  Up and coming, Michael Jackson.  Who are these people to Michael Jackson?  Who are these people?  John Mayer is sort of a friend of the show.  Kramer out there. 
[00:39:00]  Definitely friends with Jim Norton.  He was the token white guy.  You notice they didn't allow him to sing, by the way.  No.  He has that great voice, and he did an instrumental of human nature, which he did brilliantly.  It was awesome.  And then that dumb backup singer had to start singing the Michael Jackson part.  He's like, you idiot.  You got something going here.  And it wasn't John Mayer's fault.  I'm sure someone suggested that to him.  And then he was on Larry King last night, and Larry King said to John Mayer something 
[00:39:30]  like, what did Michael Jackson mean to you?  And you could tell John Mayer's like, oh, shit.  I got to come up with something right the fuck now.  Well, they asked me to come on there, I guess.  Turns out he never met him.  Are you kidding me?  John Mayer never met Michael Jackson.  You think he walked up to Brooke Shields at one point and said, let's get out of here.  What do you say?  Let's hit the bricks.  Yeah.  You know, it's a great spot for John Mayer.  You can't blame him for wanting to be on stage in front of a billion people.  Oh, you got it? 
[00:40:00]  Here he is.  That was like a cool old Stratty hat, I guess.  He's doing a really good job.  I could have turned him up a little.  Why is the white guy?  Yeah.  Keep him blue in the mix.  It's just creepy with the coffin there. 
[00:40:30]  It's not creepy because, you know, it was an empty coffin.  Yeah.  We know.  It hasn't been announced officially, but that'll be our next prediction that comes true.  That's the fucking backup singer. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  You didn't need that.  I would have mixed in a little Michael Jackson there.  They should have hired me.  I would have produced this fucking thing.  When this coffin gets up to 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious shit.  That was a nice coffin, huh?  That thing ruled.  We already did this one, but what the hell?  It's worth doing again.  Rice and Reno.  Rice.  How are you guys doing?  First time in a long time.  Thanks, Rice. 
[00:41:30]  Listen.  I'm a physician, and I know a little bit about it.  What Stevie Wonder has in his head is called tension or attraction alopecia, which basically  means baldness.  They initially figured it out about 100 years ago, 1907, when little girls in Europe would  have ponytails.  You'd keep on pulling that hair back, and you cause chronic inflammation of those hair  follicles.  Eventually, they'll scar, and you'll be bald.  Yeah.  They weren't pulling his hair back too tight for the guy.  Too tight.  I bet you he would rather have his full head of hair. 
[00:42:00]  Let it go on his eyes.  What's the difference?  Yeah.  You have to move it so he can...  We got it, Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of NBA basketball players will have it.  You have to kind of let it have the old natural afro for a couple of days to kind of give  your hair a rest.  You have to pull it back down after a couple of days.  You know, thank you, sir.  Okay.  We're going to yell that.  Lora, L-O-R-A, however you say that from Jersey, she writes, Jennifer Hudson is pregnant.  That's why she was so big.  She was big before she got pregnant. 
[00:42:30]  Excuse me.  Now she at least got an excuse for her bigness.  Yeah.  She was pretty giant.  Anywho.  Let's go to Robin in Detroit.  Robin.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Robin.  First of all, I couldn't watch that whole Dog and Pony show because I had a fucking job  to go to yesterday, but I did see the replays of Anthony.  You're exactly right.  It reminds me of Susan Smith or those people that try to make a song that they're crying  and it's like...  It was just bullshit. 
[00:43:00]  The whole fucking thing.  You probably could have picked a better example than Susan Smith.  Jesus Christ.  You get those mons on there that kill their kids and they have those fake tears.  Anthony, you're 100% correct.  Thank you, Missy.  No, no.  I'm not saying you shouldn't agree with Anthony.  I'm just saying when you're talking about somebody who you feel might be forcing a motion  for the camera.  There's some...  Well, she did a good job, didn't she?  Hold on, madam.  There's somewhere between 11-year-old Paris and Susan Smith who drowned her children and  blamed it on a black man.  You could probably find a happy medium there is all I'm saying. 
[00:43:30]  Somewhere else.  Where the hell was Oprah in this whole thing?  I'm surprised she didn't show up.  Where was Oprah?  Because they...  She gave her the biggest rated show she ever had back in the 90s.  Where was she?  The reason Oprah and the rest of these people weren't there, they know what kind of guy  he really was.  They know that when this coroner's report comes out that everyone's going to fucking run  away like cockroaches.  No cause of death on the birth certificate, by the way.  They got reputations that they still are concerned about. 
[00:44:00]  Oprah should have been there.  Quincy Jones should have been there.  Diana Ross should have been there.  Everyone that did We Are The World.  Everyone that did We Are The World should have been on that stage.  I'd love to know what all those news guys said in their own personal homes when they  got home after that stupid...  God, Robin.  God bless you.  Because you know what?  Over the years, we've been lucky enough to hang out with some of these news idiots and  they play it so differently when they're not on camera.  You are 100% right.  Thank you, Opie.  And my whole thing is, why can't you do a little of that on your actual show on TV, 
[00:44:30]  you phony?  Yeah, they want their job.  And like Robin's saying, they were all wearing the glove, just like Richard Ramirez would wear  when he would bash old ladies to death with a lamp.  Did I say that?  Oh, Jimmy.  Did I say there was no cause of death on the birth certificate?  Yes, you did.  We all ignored it and felt uncomfortable for you.  Now I'm reading it.  Yeah, I said I'm an ass.  Why would there be?  Cause of death on the birth certificate?  That just makes you a pessimist.  All right, I'm an ass.  I agree wholeheartedly.  How funny would it be if...  No cause of birth on the death certificate. 
[00:45:00]  How funny would it be if Joe Jackson died in the next week or two following Michael Jackson?  What's funny about that?  Well, you know, Michael Jackson trying to get away from his father finally.  You don't want to...  And there's Joe.  Oh, jeez.  You don't want to see anybody, you know, die.  I'm joking.  It's a joke.  Saying it's, you know...  Of course I don't want to see him die.  The whole thing is a horrible gag.  Hey, let's not act like if he died we'd be losing a great humanitarian either.  True.  You know, sometimes act like he fucking...  God bless him, he knelt in Calcutta and helped the sick.  Known as a professional prick. 
[00:45:30]  Was Joe...  Pretty much it.  Was Joe there last night?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He was there?  Did you see him?  Yeah.  Was he kind of in the front row there?  Yeah, he was up there.  He was, you know, hugging and kissing everybody that came off the stage.  Look, man.  It was dark in the Staples Center.  All I saw was bouncing yellow ties.  Yeah, a lot of yellow ties.  That's all I saw.  Because when they kept panning to the front row of that audience, I just saw bouncing yellow  ties.  And I kind of wanted to do a little people watching.  Like, who's there?  I couldn't tell.  I can't tell.  It was too dark.  Where's Corey Feldman?  He looks so smart in that outfit. 
[00:46:00]  What a dummy.  Dude, my fucking teeth itch.  Let's go to Ralph and stop trying to have a moment, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  He was trying to have a moment.  We get it.  The childhood.  The connection.  We know.  Jimmy, walk us through it.  So Corey walks into the Staples Center, right?  Yeah.  Big entrance.  Yeah.  He's dressed as Michael Jackson.  What's going on?  You think people are going, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  He's hurt.  God, he's hurting.  He's dressed like that.  I forgot how connected.  He must be hurting so badly. 
[00:46:30]  More than a lot of us are.  And what was that bad movie that he did, the little dance?  He did the Michael Jackson dance.  He was dressed like Michael Jackson in a movie.  Was he?  And he did, like, a dance and everything.  Ooh.  Where he was trying to get some chick.  What the fuck movie was that?  I don't remember.  Besides horrible.  But it's very rare that you can put on an outfit and just show everybody.  Dream a little dream.  How hurt you are.  Thank you, Jayster.  Yes, dream a little dream was the one.  If you could find that clip.  We will.  Is it bad? 
[00:47:00]  Dude, it is so fucking bad.  We will.  You think your teeth are itching now.  We will, but I'm enjoying Jimmy's thing.  You think he was looking around and hoping that people were, like, feeling what he was  trying to project?  He probably had the, like, you know how you take your lips and you kind of, like, you put  them together and you nod, like, we're all fighting this together.  We all know I'm hurting more than you are, but we're all battling this together.  It's that phony I'm with you type of look.  You think some of the people in his inner circle that were there, too, are whispering  to each other, he's not doing well with this whole thing. 
[00:47:30]  He's having a tough time with it.  He's having a tough time with this one.  What is that?  I don't know.  Like, who is that?  Is this from a movie or is this a song he was trying to get out there? 
[00:48:00]  It's from a movie, right?  But is it a joke?  Like, it's meant to be horrid.  No, no, it's not.  He's really singing and dancing like Michael Jackson.  Doing an awful version of Michael Jackson.  Horrible.  Let's say how to Ralph, who was at the Staples Center last night.  Ralph.  Yuckaroo.  Hey, Ralph.  Ralph?  He's just been beating over the head and his cell phone's been taken.  God damn it.  Because he walks around as a white guy and he's lost in Compton with a fucking hat and  a yellow tie.  It's Ralph Denny. 
[00:48:30]  He's wearing a little left glove.  Hello, fellas.  I'm a little lost.  Where's the airport?  All right.  Krook.  Here's a flower pot hat.  God damn it.  I want to talk to someone that was out to you, man.  Oh, God.  Did they smash his head?  Oh, boy.  Oh, you dummy.  Hold on.  Don't get up.  Toilet seat on its way.  I danced away.  God did that little kick dance.  I've never hit anybody with a toilet seat, but I imagine I would joyously dance away  after doing so. 
[00:49:00]  Of course.  Marcia Warfield had a fucking hilarious joke.  Really?  I don't remember how she phrased it, but she was talking about the Rodney King, the riots,  and she goes, and Reginald Denny, I would say they hit that motherfucker with everything  but the kitchen sink, but I wish I could remember, but it was some really great joke.  Here's more Corey Feldman.  What are you doing with the Michael Jackson stuff?  He was really into the Michael Jackson thing.  Horrendous.  I guess we lost Ralph.  He was dancing for his chick. 
[00:49:30]  But who didn't tell him, look, you really look like a douchebag when you do this?  I don't know.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  After the break, hopefully someone that was at the Staples Center.  We got a lawyer that worked on one of the Michael Jackson cases.  We'll see if he's for real.  Oh, he must be if he's just calling up with inside information on this program.  We'll do more of your phone calls.  Jimmy requested Mariah Carey.  I'll be there.  Let's clear this up now because I heard she didn't do a particular lot.  I saw clips of it.  I don't want you to think like I was moved.  It was horrendous.  It was pretty bad. 
[00:50:00]  It was really bad.  You and I.  It's like listening to Fred Gwynn sing.  Must make a pact, Lily.  I wanted to see Jim Neighbors sing, Oh, My Papa.  That would have brought it home nicely.  And the sign said, long head free.  Oh, I thought the same thing.  Or I thought it was an Elton John song.  Ah, that's true.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:50:30]  It was a surprise.  I thought it was going to be Candle in the Wind, for real.  Really?  Ugh.  Smattering of applause.  No, that was her tits clapping as she walked across the stage.  We must make a pact.  Ha!  We must bring salvation back.  Oh, where there is love. 
[00:51:00]  I know what she missed.  She's right down low.  She's got a dropout in her range somewhere.  Absolutely.  It just comes out as air.  I wish out my head to you and you.  I have faith in all you do.  Just call my name and I'll be there. 
[00:51:30]  And we'll be back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  The whole time this song played, they should have shown a spotlight on Corey Feldman and just a little tear falling down. 
[00:52:00]  I think he went, no pictures, guys.  Please, guys.  Please, I'm having a moment.  Just not today.  Any day but today, please.  Meanwhile, he's got his own flashlight he's shining on his face from the bottom.  Not today.  Right.  He came with a guy that just has a spotlight on him.  Was that from yesterday?  That stuff like Admiral Asshole.  He really does.  Looks like an Admiral in the fucking, in the gay Navy.  Please. 
[00:52:30]  Please, guys.  Sorry.  Oh.  She missed that one.  What a set of tits, though.  We've got to give her that.  Oh, yeah.  Best tits at the ceremony.  What kind of fruits do we sound like?  Did you hear Mariah missing the notes?  Yes.  Like three old ladies.  Yeah, I don't think it was necessary to tase the backup singer. 
[00:53:00]  Well.  That was a bad moment.  Backup singer was pretty good, right?  Yeah, he wasn't bad.  He came out there.  It was a show for backup singers.  It was a show for backup singers.  Yeah, because there were no real, you know, stars.  They were saying, wow, you know, the end's going to be amazing.  Everyone's singing We Are the World from Michael.  Where was everyone that's still alive that did We Are the World?  Bring them out on stage.  Where's Willie?  Where's...  Springsteen.  Rogers and Springsteen.  And they could all just do We Are the World again.  They would be caught dead at the stage. 
[00:53:30]  We are the world.  We touch the children.  Oops.  Oops, my mistake.  They're at gigs, you know.  Fucking Bono's promoting this horrendous new album,  and Bruce is doing whatever Bruce is.  Yeah, but you would think, come on.  It's MJ.  What old MJ?  All right, we got to take a quick break.  Holy shit.  When was that picture taken?  What?  How old is that?  Not so long ago.  Not so long ago?  She still ain't bad.  She's a little on the high side.  She goes up and down.  We're looking at a Mariah Carey picture. 
[00:54:00]  What a giant set of tits on her, though.  She is.  She looks good in that picture.  A little bikini.  Yeah, she looked good in that.  Big rack.  Get a before picture, though.  Horrendous boobs before the implants.  Oh, yeah?  Horrendous, horrendous, horrendous.  Probably the most famous person to come out of Harborfield High School.  Is that her nipple?  Not probably.  I know what you're getting at.  Oh, shit.  I forgot.  Opie went to Harborfield.  Yeah, me and Mariah Carey went to the same high school.  So you're like the second most famous person out of Harborfield.  I think there's a few others.  Who else? 
[00:54:30]  No, who else came out of Harborfield?  I don't know.  I know I'm the most famous to come out of John H. Glenn.  Well, good for that.  Or at least the ninth grade of it.  Exactly.  You're the most famous millionaire to ever get thrown out with a D average.  See, you wore fucking combat Nazi boots in gym class, trying to do jumping jacks with  a fucking pith helmet.  Something's never changed.  Why don't we take a break?  We're going to clear the field because we got the Reverend Al fucking whatever the fuck  he did last night.  That ain't bad.  This opportunist continued his fucking publicity tour for himself. 
[00:55:00]  Stevie's hairline.  Look at it.  See, because this is still hair.  Yeah, but they pulled it out.  They pulled it out.  Poor guy.  He's had cornrows forever.  That was a creepy song he sang, too.  What did he sing?  Something about leaving in the summertime or I don't know.  It's creepy.  I like the happy Stevie Wonder, not the serious fucking ghoulish Stevie Wonder.  Why don't we take a break?  And what the fuck is Smokey Robinson doing that he hasn't aged in 20, 30 years? 
[00:55:30]  Amazing.  The deal with Satan that he made.  Look up Smokey Robinson.  I will bet that guy is pushing 70.  We'll find out next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  That's unbelievable.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about the Michael Jackson Memorial today.  Wow.  I was just telling these guys about a woman that I saw on CNN, and Sam found the clip, which is awesome.  It wasn't an easy find.  Oh, Sam's amazing. 
[00:56:00]  People obviously flying in from all over the world for the memorial at the Staples Center,  and most people obviously didn't get in.  They flew there hoping that their number was going to be picked in that dumb lottery.  This woman, what she had to say to the CNN guy, I was stupefied.  Stupefied.  I'll just say that to set it up.  Listen to this.  From Greensboro, North Carolina, they took three days on buses to get here.  Tell us why you wanted to be here.  And by the way, you don't have tickets. 
[00:56:30]  You just wanted to be here.  Three days on buses.  Three days on a bus.  Had to be there knowing they didn't even have tickets.  Didn't have tickets.  They didn't even try to get the tickets, I guess.  Right, right.  Okay?  Had to be there.  It gets crazier than that.  Michael, he's a true inspiration to me, and I say I wanted to see him one last time.  And when I found out he was going to be here, it really broke my heart.  And we made so many sacrifices.  We sold everything we had in our house, and we just wanted to come here. 
[00:57:00]  To be here.  All right.  One of the many fans waiting alongside, and they've all gone.  See, that reporter wanted to say, you're a dummy.  Yeah, why?  You could tell because she paused.  They sold everything in their house to go to L.A. to see Michael Jackson.  Everything in their house, and all they could get were bus tickets?  Jeez.  Well, there you go.  I guess it was short notice.  Had to give a real discount on some of those items, I gather.  Oof.  What is wrong with people? 
[00:57:30]  People are out of their minds for this guy.  He really brought out the kooky people, too, is what he did.  Corey Feldman, though, man.  He was really close to him.  Do you think he was really hurt?  Yeah, man.  By the news.  Can you see?  Or do you think he went, oh, thank God, finally.  He looks somber.  For me.  He looks somber.  I'm going to dress like him.  I'll dress in a little military uniform and do Michael Jackson dances.  It'd be great.  I'll be on the cover of all the girl cries. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, well.  Yeah.  God damn it.  I'm going to be on the cover of all the newspaper.  Jesus Christ.  And, you know, she started crying.  There was one person yelling, man up, bitch.  And it was him.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Cross body blocks her.  I told that to Anthony, whether you think it was real or not.  What Paris did makes me laugh so hard because, like I said, she's the most famous person  in the world today.  It'll start dropping down immediately.  But today, there's no one bigger than this little girl, right?  Yeah.  But all those opportunities on that stage all thought they were going to have the moment. 
[00:58:30]  Like, Reverend Al's thinking, oh, that line about, well, we'll get to it, about the  kids and what the fuck was the line?  Help me out, A.  Your daddy wasn't strange.  Right, that.  What he had to deal with.  I guarantee Reverend Al was envisioning that quote would be on every paper in America.  Or the world.  Or just, thank you, Michael.  Right.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  Right.  What's with the three-time shit?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do they do that, Jimmy? 
[00:59:00]  Why?  Why with the three times?  He's too busy, you know, worried about Corey Feldman's mental health.  Did you see how hurt he was?  I noticed him.  I know those guys.  He's in pain.  Corey Feldman.  He's in pain.  Yeah.  Corey Feldman's an ass.  He's in, dude, by the way he dressed, I remembered, God, they were close.  Yeah.  Oh, yuck.  They do.  They all wanted to be the guy on the front page of the papers.  That's why these people do this thing.  And they all got fucking yanked to the back of the paper for the little girl doing her thing. 
[00:59:30]  Let's get into Reverend Al Ant.  This was the highlight for many people.  Yeah.  Everybody was waiting for Reverend Al to get up there and give his little speech.  And like I said earlier, I want to say hi to my fellow aliens because I have to be an alien because I just don't get it.  I didn't get it.  Like, no.  It seems like most of America did.  I don't comprehend anybody.  Every time Sharpton, like the minute he stepped to that microphone, 17,000 people should have yelled, shut the fuck up. 
[01:00:00]  I was tweeting through the whole thing when Reverend Al hit the stage.  I go, well, time for a bathroom break.  Yeah.  Here we go.  It's a piss break.  It's like a drum solo at a concert.  Right.  Time to grab a beer.  I'm going to go to merch.  One thing I have to say before you even play this, I thought about this watching this last night yesterday.  You don't â€“ of course it's a memorial, so you're not going to get out there and bash somebody, especially if you're Reverend Al Sharpton. 
[01:00:30]  But then just keep some things to yourself.  You don't have to blatantly go the other way and just lie about what happened or didn't happen or whatever.  Just leave it out.  Talk about his music.  Talk about his dancing, his talent, things like that.  You don't have to go off and throw that race card out like he did and wow.  I'm with you.  Wow, did he just â€“ 
[01:01:00]  The low-down, dirty devils like the children.  Exactly.  Asshole.  Yeah.  I think you have to acknowledge that he was a weird dude that got into some shit.  Yeah.  You don't have to spend a lot of time on that, but you can go, well, we all know this, but let's try to focus on the positive.  Right, right.  It's something.  I mean he looked right down at the kids and said, your daddy wasn't strange.  You know something?  Leave that part out then.  I understand you're trying to make the kids feel better, but then don't bring up strange at all because you know what? 
[01:01:30]  He was fucking strange.  We'll say that to them privately.  Yeah, yeah.  Larry King asked Reverend Al about Paris crying and stuff, and I couldn't help â€“ he was saying that it was a big moment and stuff, but I couldn't help thinking he wanted to say to himself, damn, I wish it was a black kid that was crying.  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  I mean I'm with you with this whole he hates whitey thing now.  I'm so in.  I'm all in on that.  It's his job.  I'm so in on that one, Ant.  His job is to keep white and black people separate and angry at each other because then he has a living. 
[01:02:00]  It doesn't even seem sincere though.  It's like you're finding â€“ when the cops have a problem, white cop, black guy, we all know where he's going to wind up regardless of circumstance.  But something like this, it's like do you really have to reach that far?  Yeah.  Do you really have to?  Yeah.  Speaking of reputations, Ope, you're right about people with reputations avoiding the thing.  Did you notice how Justin Timberlake â€“ I did not notice this, and I wonder if this is true â€“ suddenly disappeared. 
[01:02:30]  He was pictured in the rehearsals, and then he was a no-show.  Oh, what happened there?  And why hasn't Oprah made a statement?  I guarantee they're trying to get a statement from Oprah.  Why didn't Obama comment about the big memorial?  Oh, he sent a letter.  Did he comment?  No, he commented when Michael originally died, but now he's avoiding it.  He sent a letter.  Did he?  And then that congresswoman that got up there and started talking about trying to pass some bill.  Yeah, that'll happen down in Washington.  That's going to happen.  All the Republicans are going to sign on to an alleged pedophile and give him a special day. 
[01:03:00]  Stop it.  Might as well wipe your ass with that thing.  Yeah, exactly.  It's worthless what you were trying to do last night.  They called it last night, but whatever, yesterday.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Reverend Al on the big stage.  The opportunist himself.  The fredilist â€“ I can't do that.  I don't want to do your line.  You've got to say it again for the people just tuning in.  Oh, wait.  What?  Reverend Al?  His new look.  Oh, Frederick Douglass.  He is trying his best to look like Frederick Douglass from the old Underground Railroad. 
[01:03:30]  He's not cutting his hair.  It's turning gray, and he's just brushing it backwards.  That is a hell of a look, the Frederick Douglass.  I first met Michael.  Shut up.  Boo.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Die.  You stink.  Turn it off.  I got something to say.  That's exactly how it should have went.  I know.  Who gives a shit?  It's not about you, Al.  Oh.  I, I, me.  Yes.  I first met Michael when I was purchasing a sweatsuit. 
[01:04:00]  Of course you are, fatso.  When my gold medallion smacked his head and nearly knocked him out.  Yes.  I first met Michael around 1970, Black Expo.  Of course.  Chicago, Illinois, Reverend Jesse Jackson, who stood by his family till now.  And from that day as a cute kid to this moment, he never gave up dreaming.  It was that dream.  No, Al, I think he gave up on dreaming. 
[01:04:30]  When you start, you know, wandering around with an anesthesiologist, I think you have  to completely give up on dreaming.  Because guess what an anesthesiologist does?  It knocks you out where you can't dream.  Just fucking puts you out.  Completely out where you have, you have no clue you were just out for hours.  No, you wake up.  Guess what?  It's hours later.  You're not in dreamland at that point.  He kept on dreaming.  He dreamt that he wouldn't grow up to look like his father.  So he fixed his nose and put a cleft in his chin.  And he fixed his hair. 
[01:05:00]  Shut up, Al.  Yeah, he desecrated every African feature that he had.  He went to a surgeon and disfigured himself to rid himself of every African feature that  he had.  His nose, his lips, his skin color, his hair, everything.  Takes the DNA of two white people, has white kids.  White children.  So Reverend Al is saying what here?  That he's the pride of the community?  Yeah, if you're going to make race an issue. 
[01:05:30]  Right, which he is.  He certainly is.  You have to look at the fact.  I don't think Michael was fighting being black.  I think it was probably some kind of thing with his dad.  It's like apparently he didn't like his father.  And this was the ultimate fuck you.  Didn't want to look like him.  Yeah.  And didn't want the same kind of family.  He wanted his kids to look like him.  A white dude.  Yeah.  You know, because if you're going to create a kid in a lab, you can't, you know, find  some fucking black sperm and a black egg somewhere that match up nice.  You know, the donors go, you know what?  I'm going to take this black dude and this hot black bitch and I'm going to make some 
[01:06:00]  really fine looking black kids.  Jimmy the Greek?  Well, that's what they did.  I mean, and that's not even a Jimmy the Greek.  They actually made a kid in a lab somewhere.  How about you just or how about you do at least you go overseas and adopt someone that's  from a fucking horrible place whose life you're going to make better instead of having  genetically beautiful, perfect children.  Engineered.  Go get a kid whose mother died of AIDS or who has nothing and who's going to grow up  in poverty.  You know, come on.  If you're going to do it like that.  As far as what Michael seemed to have been attracted to, it was young white boys. 
[01:06:30]  Those were the people that he liked hanging out with a lot.  But, you know, most of the celebrities, Corey Feldman, for one, who, by the way, looked  so sad and somber and hurt.  He really looked wounded.  You're concerned, aren't you?  I was worried because, oh, God, it's right.  He used to dress like that and here he is having a moment.  That is such a trying to have a moment thing.  Because someone find audio of Corey Feldman. 
[01:07:00]  Some dumb blogger, I'm sure, got a hold of him.  Someone talked to him.  And got him on their website.  Oh, I'm certain of it.  He was really hurt, Jimmy.  He really was.  And it was upsetting to watch.  I forgot that he would be hurt, too.  Oh, fuck me.  P.U.  Oh, P.U.  was right.  He never gave up dreaming.  Yeah.  It was that dream that changed culture all over the world.  Oh, you want to say color there.  When Michael started, it was a different world. 
[01:07:30]  But because Michael kept going, because he didn't accept limitations.  This is great.  Because he refused to let people decide his boundaries.  He opened up the whole world.  In the music world.  Can I make a comment here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  What is he talking about?  What about all the...  If I was a black artist that was older than Michael Jackson, I'd go, go fuck yourself.  Thank you.  I had a fine fucking career.  What about the 50s and 60s with... 
[01:08:00]  There were plenty of black artists.  Bo Diddley?  Yeah.  Massively huge.  Diana Ross and the Supremes.  Massively huge black artists.  Massively huge.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson just was one of a kind.  He just happened to be better than all those black performers.  That's all.  He was really good.  He became the biggest, but...  So he didn't accept limitations or boundaries, except for the one set by Nature, where he  decided to disregard the way they said that he should look and fucking...  And go see somebody.  I guess Dr. Nicopolis was busy, but tied up with Elvis lawsuits. 
[01:08:30]  So he went to another doctor.  Horse's ass sharpness.  He is the worst.  But to me, this sounds emotionless.  This sounds like, to me, like you're just saying something that really can't be criticized.  He was a dreamer.  He cared about people.  Like, yeah, all right, I guess.  Yeah, right.  In the music world, he put on one glove, pulled his pants up, and broke down the color curtain  where now our videos are shown and magazines put us on the cover. 
[01:09:00]  Hour.  It was Michael Jackson that brought blacks and whites and Asians and Latinos together.  Was it really Reverend Allen, or was the world kind of ready for something new?  Yeah.  Where it was like, okay, you know what?  And there were real, like, activists and things, and just people that broke down barriers and  really took the brunt of, you know, fire hoses and police dogs and walking into segregated schools. 
[01:09:30]  And just like, Michael Jackson sang and danced very well.  Dude, I didn't look at him as a fucking, I didn't look at him as an activist for the black cause.  This motherfucker, this Reverend Al Sharpton, is a parody.  Michael Jackson did some really good things. 
[01:10:00]  He put up some music, put out some music, and danced very well, and entertained a lot of people.  And did a lot of charity work, and, you know, fun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Too bad Little Richard wasn't there to go on stage and punch Reverend Al in the face.  And just go, Reverend Al, what about my fucking career, you asshole?  Or how about Sammy Davis, who used to travel with Sinatra, and they wanted him to stay in a different hotel.  There you go.  And Sinatra said, if he doesn't stay here, I'm not staying here.  Yeah.  How about that?  How about Sammy, who really ate shit?  What about the great Nat King Cole?  You can see how a white girl can fall for him.  See?  Exactly. 
[01:10:30]  Sammy Davis.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Talking about Fred Travolina.  Oh, we're back to that.  But, I mean, come on, Al.  Just stop it.  This is Reverend Al's racist agenda.  His racist agenda that he brought into this memorial service.  And did he have to say he pulled his pants up?  He pulled his pants up.  I wouldn't be saying that when I was referring to Michael Jackson. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, he wiped it on the curtain.  He pulled his pants up because it was time to sing.  It's also the same thing he did when he heard a knock at the door suddenly.  Pulled his pants up and wiped.  Ian Rice from Long Island.  Opie, please have Jimmy refer to Reverend Al as a blithering idiot.  So appropriate here.  I don't want to knock Reverend Al.  They'd love me to say blithering idiot.  But I don't like to say that when it comes to a man of Al Sharpton's, a man of his ilk.  Ilk.  All Al Sharpton should be saying is, ladies and gentlemen, I apologize to Stephen Pagonis. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  That's all he should be saying.  Yeah, how about that?  Fucking asshole.  Want to continue?  Yes.  Of course.  He created a comfort level where people that felt they were separate became interconnected  with his music.  Can you pause that?  What's the difference between interconnected and connected?  Interconnected.  What does that mean?  Can somebody define interconnected?  Interconnected.  Is there a way like, we're connected. 
[01:12:00]  No, no, no.  We're interconnected.  And can someone tell me the difference?  Or is that just horseshit adding syllables because it sounds better?  So why is it so important for Reverend Al to have black people live in the white people's world?  He is so.  Why don't you just do your own thing and go, all right, cool.  We're happy.  He is a black supremacist is what he is.  He is a black supremacist.  He is a racist.  He is a separatist.  And that's how he makes his money. 
[01:12:30]  That's why he's wearing a very expensive suit.  He's wearing a very expensive suit up there.  Uh, it is paid for from money that he gets by keeping white people and black people at odds with each other by doing things just like this, dividing, making people angry with what he says because it's very divisive.  This is what he does.  That's his job.  His job is in healing.  It's not making people feel good about being together. 
[01:13:00]  It's not making people feel good about there being a black president.  And look at how far we've come.  It's about him stirring the fucking pot up, getting people pissed and keeping them pissed at each other.  And the money rolls on in.  There's no place for this kind of racial, uh, uh, dividing that, that he's doing at a memorial service for the likes of Michael Jackson.  Are you saying that Sharpton is a racist? 
[01:13:30]  Yes.  I'm absolutely saying Al Sharpton is a racist.  Sharpton is a racist.  Yes.  Google bomb.  And, and, and, and.  I Google bomb.  Which one do you want to go with?  A separatist and a black supremacist.  He wants to see, uh, his people, uh, attain a level of superiority above all other races in this country.  Which, by the way, no problem with that.  Do it.  Which one do you want to go with?  But don't fucking lie and, and, and make it like under the guise that you're, uh, uh, trying to heal and, and bring, uh, uh, different cultures together. 
[01:14:00]  That's bullshit.  You're, you're, you're like fucking Hitler.  Hitler, the guy's like an Adolf Hitler kind of guy.  He has a certain people that he wants to rise up and everybody else is the problem, the scapegoat.  And, uh, his, his perfect world would be, uh, African Americans, um, ruling the nation, uh, under his, uh, leadership. 
[01:14:30]  I'd rather have the best people for the job.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't care.  For real.  I don't, you know, I don't give a, I don't really give a shit what color you are.  I take a lot of heat.  Best person for the job.  I take a lot of heat, uh, for a lot of my stance on, on, on things.  But the truth of the matter is, yes, the best person for the job, that's it.  And if no one calls this motherfucker out and they're afraid to debate him, well, I, I was embarrassed for poor Imus when he sat there and, and talked with, uh, Reverend Al and just got lambasted by the motherfucker.  Sit down here, Al, sit down on our show and I will talk to you, uh, one-on-one and, and expose you for the, the liar and racist that you are. 
[01:15:00]  Absolutely.  And Sharpton, he's not a dumb guy.  Like, I saw him debate when he was talking about Imus.  I saw him and he's, he's really good at sidestepping.  Oh, man.  He's really, he's not an idiot.  I mean, he's used to being fucking people, uh, disagreeing with him and he just has a great, he's excellent in 35 second or 40 second soundbite snippets. 
[01:15:30]  Like when they're doing those O'Reilly's or all those other shows, he knows how to say something that can be taken as an entire soundbite in a, he knows exactly how to talk to a camera.  You know what else he does?  You know what else he does that, that is infuriating?  Yes.  That's my hopes and dreams.  You know what he does that infuriates me?  When someone makes a valid point about him, he'll turn around with a half-assed excuse and a sidestep as he goes like, well, well, you know. 
[01:16:00]  And he'll do this chuckling laughter thing to make it look like what you just said is a joke and should just be blown off as a joke.  Like everyone should be chuckling and laughing at you.  Uh, when in fact it was a valid point that he's just not answering.  Oh, well, let's get back to the speech.  You want a Google bomb today or what?  How about, uh, as long as there's nothing negative about Reverend Al.  I mean, the guy who's up there obviously works very hard. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Because there's many ways to do this.  He's a good, great man.  Let's go with Rev, R-E-V, Al.  Rev Al is a racist.  That would be the first one.  And smells like farts.  You're messing up our Google bomb, Jimmy.  Why can't he be a racist who smells like farts?  But you're wrecking it.  I've never been that close to the man.  Let's make that the second most searched.  Reverend Al is a racist who smells like farts.  So say we the people.  Google bomb it quickly.  And we feel bad for Corey Feldman, dot, dot, dot. 
[01:17:00]  Corey Feldman is hurt.  That should be the Google bomb.  Corey Feldman is hurt.  Let's just take over Google today.  All right.  Let's go with Rev.  Rev Al is a racist.  Let's just do that one.  R-E-V, Al is a racist.  Okay.  And then you pick the Corey Feldman.  Corey Feldman is hurting.  Is hurting.  Is hurting.  That's it.  Corey Feldman is hurting.  Is hurting. 
[01:17:30]  Ah, stupid Corey Feldman.  Is hurting.  What a dunce.  What an idiot.  Hey, man.  I saw that outfit and I was like, God, I was reminded.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  They had a connection.  That's right.  I forgot.  It was like the mini Michael Jackson.  They palled around.  Hey, talk about your pain.  Talk about your pain.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Of all the dramatic things.  Oh, God.  Look, more Reverend Al. 
[01:18:00]  Connected with his music.  And it was that comfort level that kids from Japan and Ghana and France and Iowa and Pennsylvania  got comfortable enough with each other.  Until later, it wasn't strange to us to watch Oprah on television.  It wasn't strange to watch Tiger Woods golf.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What are you talking about?  Oh, we got it.  Black people.  We get it. 
[01:18:30]  We get it.  Didn't Oprah pretty much start the same time as, well, I mean, as far, like the thriller  years?  Because that's what he's getting at.  Yeah, but the thing is, like, did you ever hear the Flip Wilson show?  Like, black people, we were comfortable watching black people on television.  Sanford and Son, one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.  We could sit there and watch black people on television and not go, oh, my God.  They're in my house through the television.  You know, it's just all in the family brought, like, that whole thing into the forefront where 
[01:19:00]  racism and bigotry was brought into your living room like that.  It's like, this motherfucker, this isn't the place or the person to be bringing this  up with.  This is Al's agenda.  He's trying to put the square block in the round hole here.  He has his agenda that does not fit Michael Jackson's memorial. 
[01:19:30]  But he didn't give a shit.  So he's trying to custom tailor it to Michael Jackson and failing miserably.  He's trying to shoehorn his stupid.  He's got to have some racial angle.  He's irrelevant even with that.  Without that, he is the proverbial hole in the donut.  He's trying to shoehorn it into the ceremony.  And it's not necessary.  It's like, no, no matter who you are, you got to acknowledge.  All right.  Look, Michael Jackson, probably the biggest music star ever. 
[01:20:00]  And he pretty much crossed racial lines everywhere.  Well, that was it.  Yeah, he did.  People love the fucking guy.  They loved him in Africa.  They loved him in Germany.  They love him here, everywhere.  Come on.  In Ghana.  Right.  And Japan.  France and Japan.  And Iowa.  Just say everywhere, Al.  Yeah.  Remind me to talk about the Michael Jackson ghost after this Reverend Al thing.  You saw the Michael Jackson ghost thing, right?  Please say you did.  I didn't.  All right.  I'll turn you on to a little something something today. 
[01:20:30]  Is it scary?  Will I be frightened?  You might be frightened.  Ghosts.  Yes.  Ghosts.  Michael Jackson's ghost.  I saw a wispy apparition.  It had a glove.  It said Theodore.  Theodore.  Theodore.  Michael Jackson ghosts.  Yeah.  When do you end the essay on the end?  Ghosts.  It kind of goes away when you feel like if you don't breathe soon, you'll die.  Ghosts.  And then you got to breathe.  Ghosts.  Breathe, Ted. 
[01:21:00]  Breathe.  Also remind me about Larry King wearing a Michael Jackson hat last night because that  was terrific, too.  I don't know.  No, he didn't.  Yes.  No, he didn't.  Yes.  I'll put it this way.  I'm so positive you're lying.  Like, Larry King is a fool.  Yes.  And he's terrible at his job.  But if you tell me he had on a Michael Jackson hat, I'll suck every dick in the room.  All right.  Even if he didn't.  Wait.  Do we have to allow you to suck our dicks?  Do we have a say in this?  Let's not take it that far.  No say. 
[01:21:30]  I was just making an off-the-cuff joke.  I don't want to get literal.  I don't want to have to answer a real question.  It's uncomfortable for everyone.  Then I have to go, no, I was kidding.  Yes, a ghost of Michael Jackson.  Also, Michael Jackson found in a tree stump.  So, you know, this has taken on a life of its own.  But more Reverend Al.  It wasn't strange to watch Tiger Woods golf.  Those young kids grew up from being teenage, comfortable fans of Michael to being 40 years old.  Shut up.  And being comfortable to vote for a person of color to be the president of the United States of America. 
[01:22:00]  Boy, what a ham-handed way to throw that fucking thing in there.  What a ham-handed attempt to work in Michael Jackson, who sang, danced wonderfully, into Obama being elected president.  Just stop it.  He's talking like Michael Jackson was the catalyst.  No, I think Martin Luther King Jr. was possibly a catalyst, and many others between Martin Luther King Jr. and Michael Jackson. 
[01:22:30]  He was just one of many.  I was speaking about the...  Oh, boy.  Yes.  No, about what you were just saying.  Oh, you were?  Black leaders, and then not only that, but hardworking black people with families and just jobs, just people that go out and assimilate to the American way of life, which I believe is the majority. 
[01:23:00]  That is what made us transcend to the point where we can get along better nowadays than we used to, we have a better understanding of each other, and we have a black president.  Not a guy that did a great zombie video back in the 80s.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  Reverend Al is shoehorning, as Jimmy said, his agenda into this memorial. 
[01:23:30]  Plus, he doesn't understand pop culture, this Reverend Al, because he doesn't want to acknowledge all the freakish and weird shit that Michael Jackson was into.  But Michael Jackson, if you really look into what he was all about and study him a little bit, he understood marketing himself.  He completely understood it.  Half that stuff he was doing, he probably didn't even believe in.  I'm not talking about the kid thing and all that.  I'm talking about all that weird, like, I'm going to have a chimp for a while. 
[01:24:00]  I'm going to get the sleep chamber.  I'm going to buy the elephant man's bones.  I bet you he was sitting around going, watch, they're going to eat this up.  Yeah, they're going to love it.  I think he was way more calculated.  I don't think he was just willy-nilly with all this shit.  I really don't.  Yeah?  I really don't.  I don't think he was just completely off his rocker, as they say?  I think he got nuts as time went on, but I also think he understood the game of pop culture and marketing.  They talk about how when he was really young, he was 11 years old, and someone went to him and said, it works way better if they know you're eight. 
[01:24:30]  He goes, okay.  And he just got it.  He understood from an early age.  Like, oh, I see how you could do this.  That's great.  Because an eight-year-old with a voice like that, a little better than an 11-year-old with a voice like that.  Or it might have been 10, whatever.  But they dropped his age down a couple years.  From the beginning, he understood how to manipulate the people and the media.  Sharpton, if I didn't hate his guts so much and have such a lack of respect for him, I would almost be embarrassed for him. 
[01:25:00]  It's like watching somebody try to fucking fit their catchphrase in.  It's like watching Jimmy Walker speak and somehow manage to go, Michael was dino-mite.  Dino-mite.  It's like watching a guy who has to bring race into it.  And it's like, it's so inappropriate here.  It just doesn't, it means nothing to the ceremony.  He's adding nothing.  There's no place for this.  It's shit.  It's his agenda squeezed in where it does not belong. 
[01:25:30]  James Brown, I can understand you talking that way about.  James Brown.  According to Reverend Al, James Brown was nothing.  Those were all just like little...  Yeah, by the way, yeah, James Brown would have fit in that category.  He was just one of those guys that shucked and jived and no one really paid attention to him until Michael Jackson showed everyone the way.  I would be pissed off if I was a black entertainer today that came before Michael Jackson, especially.  But Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier.  That wonderful actor, Sidney Poitier.  The funniest part is fucking of the British officers and Ricky Gervais is talking to the black guy in the office. 
[01:26:00]  He goes, a wonderful actor, Mr. Sidney Poitier.  He just always mentions black actors to the black guy.  Sidney Poitier, yeah.  Denzel Washington.  Very funny.  What about the black dude from the Allman Brothers, man?  Who?  What?  The black bassist from the Rolling Stones.  What?  What about Billy Preston?  What?  Where they going around and there it goes.  What about sitting on the dock of the bay?  Oh, fuck.  See?  How many days after he did that did he die? 
[01:26:30]  I have to know.  Less than a week.  I've heard that it was like three days or four days after he recorded that.  Left his studio.  Left his studio.  Is that true?  Yes.  A plane crash right after that?  Pretty much, Jimmy.  He has no idea what a monster he just wrote.  How about Marvin Berry?  Oh, was he Chuck Berry's cousin?  I wish that would have been made a bit more clear in that movie.  Who's Chuck Berry?  You know, Marvin Berry.  Yeah, we get it.  That's how we talk.  Hi, this is your cousin, Norton.  Jim Norton.  We got it.  Oh, you explaining the joke.  Fucking movie stunk. 
[01:27:00]  Come on, stop.  It was awful.  What about Chuck Berry, though?  He was nothing, Reverend Al?  Yeah, no, Reverend Al, nothing.  How about Chubby Checker?  Yeah.  Who sang at my birthday party?  He certainly did.  You bet he did.  That big queen.  Talking about his wife?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Where's he?  I mean, we don't know.  More Reverend Al.  There are those that like to dig around mess, but millions around the world, we're going 
[01:27:30]  to uphold his message.  Yeah, are you?  It's not about mess.  It's about his love message.  Oh, wait.  Pause that.  I see what he did there.  What was he doing, Jimmy?  What was he doing?  I got you thinking mess, because that's a very natural way to speak.  It's not about mess.  Mess.  It's about message.  Did he fucking jot that down and think that was worthy of a speech?  Did he think that was, I have a dream?  Did he think that was a brilliant line? 
[01:28:00]  He winked to his people like, look what I do right now.  Mess?  I'll turn mess into message, motherfucker.  Watch what I do here.  You watch me turn mess into message.  I could do it.  Did Corey enjoy the Reverend Al speech?  I bet you, I bet you when he said mess, it's not about message.  I bet you Corey kind of had his lips together and nodded in silent agreement.  Like, that is what it's about.  Yeah.  Damn, that's what it's about.  It's not about mess.  It's about message.  He's a parody of a civil rights leader.  He is a parody. 
[01:28:30]  How do you, how do you get on stage and blurt this drivel out?  Right.  Well, it's not about mess, Ant.  It's about message.  It's about message.  What about Jimi Hendrix, people?  Exactly.  Yeah, there you go.  You want to talk about a talented black dude in a white man's world.  And crossing over?  Holy shit.  He was cross town traffic.  Yeah.  Now, that was a crossover artist that showed a lot of people, hey, look, a black guy can rock. 
[01:29:00]  What about the great Ike Turner?  Well.  That's right.  He showed that he could fucking sing and admire Jake LaMotta.  Yes.  Isn't it true that he came up with the first rock song, the great Ike Turner?  In 1953.  You think before Bo Diddley?  I don't know.  That's Kevin from Connecticut.  I think Kevin from Connecticut is right.  And thank you, Doug.  It's J-Mo.  Black dude from the Allman Brothers.  J-Mo.  J-Mo.  Oh.  J-A-E.  The black drummer from the Allman Brothers.  J-Mo.  Not about mess. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, let's get back on.  It's about message.  About message.  That's good.  That wasn't a stretch at all.  No, no.  It was a very natural, a very powerful moment, Al.  You think at that point.  Terrible.  What a hack.  You think during the-  What a civil rights hack.  You think during the Reverend Al's speech, Corey Feldman was just looking around the Staples  Center seeing how many people are noticing that.  He was slowly nodding.  Craning his neck.  Yeah.  Hey, everybody.  I'm agreeing.  I'm a little hurt.  I bet when he clapped, the thing Clinton would do with his lips, when you're like-  And Elliott Spitzer did it when he got caught.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Anthony, you're better-  How do you phrase that?  It's not pursing your lips.  It's almost like a frown with your lips tightly sealed and the corners of your mouth going  down and going like-  Clinton used to do it a lot.  You're right.  I'm hurting, Corey.  I looked around-  Don't look like making a car mouth.  If I don't bring up Corey Feldman another 25 times today, I'm not doing my job.  That's all you should be talking about is Corey.  Bill? 
[01:30:30]  Hello?  Bill?  Anyone?  Bill?  Becomes a law.  Bixby.  Think black, my friend.  Another great entertainer.  Bill?  Cosby.  Give yourself a bill!  Yeah.  I mean, these guys all came before Michael Jackson was doing his Thriller video.  I think Pryor was much more important.  Pryor, exactly.  How about Richard Pryor?  Holy shit.  Pryor.  Pryor over Cosby every time.  Boy, that broke down a few barriers right there.  Pryor allowed you to see exactly how black people were thinking. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And he was the master at not attempting to make white people feel bad.  You knew he was telling you the truth and you couldn't not laugh.  I mean, that was the fucking-  It's hysterical.  The greatest white band ever, the Beatles.  Have to give it to them.  Yeah.  Had Billy Preston in the band.  Yeah.  They invited Billy Preston into the Beatles.  When?  Who knew that?  I never heard of Billy Preston.  No?  No.  What songs did it be on with the Beatles?  Play up in the sky. 
[01:31:30]  What about the great Earl Douglas?  Fucking Earl.  Earl Douglas.  Sing?  Hallelujah.  Breaking down barriers.  Great Eminem.  Oh.  Yeah.  As you climb up steep mountains, sometimes you scar your knee.  No, that's good.  Sometimes you break your skin.  Pause.  There's other times you scar your knee.  Thank you.  We just stumbled over that one, didn't we?  Oh, wow.  When you're nearly to wipe the tears off a youngster's face before they testify in open 
[01:32:00]  court.  That's a little rug burn.  Yeah.  That's the other time you scar your knee.  Occasionally you get a paper cut.  We're counting out $15 million.  Yes, that's funny.  When you only wear one glove because the other glove has handy blood on it.  Oh, Jesus.  Fuck this guy.  Absolutely.  What are you, you're climbing a mountain, you scar your knee?  Yeah, see, that's his, this is the closest he's going to get. 
[01:32:30]  What does that mean?  To, I don't know what that means.  It means when you're climbing, when you're reaching greatness.  At the level Michael Jackson did.  You are going to, if on your way up to that, that, that summit, uh, you're gonna, you know,  skin your knee occasionally.  A bump in the road end?  Bumps in the road.  You're gonna maybe do some things, uh, that you'd look back at and say, maybe I shouldn't  have done that because I skinned my knee.  I should have taken another way around.  Jesus.  I shouldn't have touched that lad's weenie. 
[01:33:00]  Am I, am I wrong?  I mean, it's sharp didn't say, this is what it sounded like.  He said, uh, on the way up the mountain, occasionally a penis winds up in the hands of a youngster.  Occasionally.  You see a nude boy.  Is that what he means?  It's not about the mountain.  It's about mounting a young boy.  Some other examples, my friend.  God, oh my.  He's just awful.  He's the worst.  Jackie. 
[01:33:30]  Onassis.  That's right.  Robinson.  Robinson.  I mean, Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson was very late to the party.  What, you know, the point Reverend Al's making, he was very late to the party.  Come on, really?  How about Pumpsy Green?  Even Boston said, okay, it's time.  It's time.  The great Pumpsy Green.  And how about, one of Jimmy's favorites, Muhammad Ali.  Yes.  I'm going to talk about a guy that brought everyone together.  Went through some shit, generated some bad ill will between the races at one point. 
[01:34:00]  He bucked the U.S. government.  Even when he turned into a Muslim, we still were all in.  Most of us.  Ali aligned himself.  Because that scared people back then.  With absolutely the scariest black organization in America.  That scared a lot of people back then.  Still scares people, obviously, to this day.  But not as much as when Ali said, I'm going to be a Muslim.  Yeah, when he was sitting there with a FOI, Fruit of Islam hat.  Yeah.  People were very uncomfortable with that.  And Ali didn't give a fuck. 
[01:34:30]  Horrible hats.  Well, yeah, I guess so.  I probably would have made caps, but.  It certainly does make a statement when you see it, though.  Yes, FOI.  That's not good.  No.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  This is going to be a rough day.  Other side of the street.  Time across the street.  You need.  Sometimes you break your skin.  But don't focus on the scars.  No.  Focus on the journey.  Michael be the Michael rose to the top.  He out sang his cynics. 
[01:35:00]  He out danced his doubters.  But hold on.  Let me see.  That fucking pissed me off.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Ant, do you want to comment on him out singing his cynics?  I would like to say that I don't think one person was criticizing his singing or his dancing.  I don't think he had to out sing his critics.  It wasn't like people said, wow, his voice sucks.  And he said, watch this.  And then sang.  And they went, that's amazing.  I was wrong.  It wasn't like he danced. 
[01:35:30]  And people said, oh, what's he doing?  That's horrible.  And then he danced again.  And people went, oh, now he's good.  Okay.  See, he was brought up on pedophilia charges.  That's a rough one.  Acquitted.  That's not like not paying your taxes.  By the way, an acquittal does not mean innocence.  It just means you were acquitted.  OJ killed two people.  I don't care what people say.  He killed two people.  He was acquitted.  But then there's that $15 million settlement. 
[01:36:00]  That's a little rough.  It's a rough one.  That's a rough one.  That's a rough little skinned knee, Reverend Al.  Was there more than one settlement with more than one kid?  Or was there only that one?  I heard there was more than one.  I heard there was.  We've heard things.  Yeah, I heard things.  I don't know what's official.  I don't either.  So I'm not going to speculate.  We don't do that on this show.  But the thing is, it's amazing how they spin it.  And they go, well, you're so negative if you talk about.  If you're talking about a guy doing drugs or having some problems with the police.  Or, hey, look, the guy got locked up for tax evasion.  Yeah.  That's where this is a time to focus on the positive and not the negative. 
[01:36:30]  When it comes to fucking more than one charge of child molesting, you're a shallow motherfucker  if you're focusing on the fact that the guy did great music videos.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Who cares?  By the way, that, as far as Reverend Al is concerned, is supposed to wipe clean any allegations of pedophilia.  And him, not allegations, him sleeping in bed with young children, which he admitted to. 
[01:37:00]  He openly admitted to doing that.  Very inappropriate conduct with children.  And as far as Reverend Al goes, wipe that all under the carpet because he sang and danced amazingly.  Yeah, it's amazing.  The message should be just the opposite.  Like, yeah, he was a great entertainer.  Yes, he was a very talented guy.  Very gifted singer.  Fantastic.  But he admitted sleeping in a bed with children. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  It was inappropriate.  And he used his power and his money.  Right.  And the fact that he had iconic status since the early 70s to allow this behavior.  Yeah.  He was permitted to do it because of who he was.  Exactly.  He didn't outperform the pessimists, by the way. 
[01:38:00]  He hasn't had a hit in 10 to 15 years, probably.  Yeah.  So, no, he never did what Reverend Al just said there.  Yeah, and pessimists were people who were accusing him of being a pedophile.  They weren't singing and dancing.  They were in a court.  Right.  He should say his lawyers out-litigated the other lawyers.  Fair enough.  His accountant.  His bank account.  He never got past all that.  No, no.  The molestation charges.  No.  And he shouldn't have.  And the kid touching all that.  He never got past that, Reverend Al.  What are you talking about? 
[01:38:30]  His last hit, I think we've figured out, was 93, maybe?  That's 16 years ago.  I love this speech.  It's just, what, two minutes long?  And we have to stop every second because he is the most hypocritical,  race-baiting, ass-wipe out there.  It's honest to God, I've heard a lot of speeches.  This is one of the most uninspiring shit-heap speeches I've ever heard.  This is doing, it's a shit-heap of a speech.  I've never been so unmoved. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Black leaders are usually very powerful speakers.  Charismatic.  Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, even Sharpton in his moments can be a great speaker.  Fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  This is, I'd rather hear Mel Tillis talking about something.  I'm completely uninspired.  Because he doesn't believe in what he's saying.  No, it's nonsensical.  He's like, wow, this is a great opportunity for me.  You know what?  CNN saw it differently, though.  Maybe they could pull the audio of them praising how great Reverend Al was.  Oh, fuck those assholes and stupid Wolf Blitzer and his shitty music bed.  That made me just scream at the TV. 
[01:39:30]  Maybe Al does believe what he's saying, which makes me even feel worse for him.  Yeah, who knows?  He got knocked down, he got back up.  Every time you counted him out, he came back in.  Michael never stopped.  Michael never stopped.  Michael never stopped.  Shut up.  Yeah, I guess so.  I've heard that he never stopped.  Despite the police stepping in.  I heard Michael never stopped.  Well, he was just referring to Michael Jackson's hit song, Don't Stop Till You Get a Knife. 
[01:40:00]  God, yeah.  Well, maybe that's it.  You know.  And everybody thought PYT was about a girl, about a girl, about a girl.  We get it three times.  Makes it more important.  Chiz bucket.  The three-time yelling thing is so activist hack.  Here we go.  You ready?  He's a hacktivist.  This is the family and talking to the kids.  This was the line he was hoping was going to be printed on every paper in the world.  And then Paris cried.  And guess what, Reverend Al? 
[01:40:30]  Back page.  I want to say to Mrs. Jackson and Joe Jackson, his sisters and brothers, we thank you for  giving us someone that taught us love, someone that taught us hope.  Yeah.  We want to thank you because we know it was your dream, too.  We know that your heart is broken.  I know you have some comfort from the letter from the president of the United States and 
[01:41:00]  Nelson Mandela.  But this was your child.  This was your brother.  This was your cousin.  Nothing will fill your heart's loss.  Right.  Can we stop right there?  But I hope the love...  That, to me, is acceptable and sincere.  There you go.  And that is all he should have said.  That should have been the whole point of his speech, is the loss, his talent, the family,  things like that.  But he shoehorned in his racial, racist agenda, which was inappropriate and out of place. 
[01:41:30]  And no one is fucking bringing it up on the news.  No one.  Cowards.  There's such fucking little pussies on the news.  They won't just say, this guy mentioning race is just stupid.  It's inappropriate.  Again, if it was a white entertainer who died, and there was a white activist up there speaking  about how he was for us, or he was ours, people would go, what a racist asshole.  Yeah, what do you mean, ours? 
[01:42:00]  You almost feel hacky, the media, the media.  But it's like, you guys are such fucking little pussies.  Just phonies.  Just say it.  Your heart's lost.  But I hope the love that people are showing will make you know he did live in vain.  And I want his three children to know.  Here we go.  Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy.  It was strange what your daddy had to deal with.  But he dealt with it. 
[01:42:30]  Can we guess his next statement, how he dealt with it?  I want to say dignity.  Oh, good.  By, um...  Paying off.  Yes, by signing a check.  He dealt with it by signing a check.  Signing a check.  How great would that be?  Oh, my God, imagine that.  That would get you on the paper, Al.  He dealt with it by wearing a SARS mask.  He dealt with it by having an umbrella like Sandy Duncan.  Fucking asshole walking with an umbrella over him to heat the sun off him. 
[01:43:00]  He was strange.  He did what you said earlier, where, like, this big thing, he kind of just brushes aside with a quick little...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, an aside.  You know, all that little thing.  No, that wasn't strange.  It was strange what he had to deal with.  He equated child molestation charges to a skinned knee.  What?  Yes.  And finally, this.  So some came today, Mrs. Jackson, to say goodbye to Michael.  I came to say thank you. 
[01:43:30]  No, you didn't.  Thank you because you never stopped.  I came for FaceTime.  Thank you because you never gave up.  Thank you because you never gave out.  Thank you because you tore down our divisions.  Thank you because you eradicated barriers.  Thank you because you gave us.  Thank you, by the way.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And the three.  The big three ending.  God, he's trying so hard.  He is trying so goddamn hard and failing miserably. 
[01:44:00]  Swing and a miss, fat boy.  Now sit your ass down and shut up.  Now sit back down and make sure Corey Feldman's okay.  Yeah, go put your arm around, Corey, because if anyone's hurt, it's him.  Corey, are you okay?  Oh, my.  Corey Feldman's a tool.  What a fucking, just what drivel.  You think they had to kind of hold him up as he walked into the Staples Center dressed like Michael Jackson?  Like he was collapsing? 
[01:44:30]  Just slightly, though, not because he knows how to play it.  You know, you can't completely collapse.  Dude, that was just.  Horseshit.  Complete horseshit.  Well, maybe we'll get to what CNN had to say.  I'm like, I'm an alien.  I know it now.  Complete horseshit.  I just don't see it close to how they saw it on CNN.  Yeah.  Don't see it.  Okay.  God.  Shit.  Give me a fucking break.  Fans react to.  All right. 
[01:45:00]  Look, we could try to squeeze one more in before the break.  We have so much to do.  We got fans react to Michael Jackson Memorial.  Oh, you want the Michael Jackson ghost?  Ghosts?  Yes.  Already?  We should do that.  How many people are going to be selling potato chips on eBay with Michael Jackson's image on it?  Sam had it.  No way.  Already?  Oh, I don't know.  Sam just awkwardly ran down the hall.  So, okay.  Well, that's what he does.  Here we go.  Thank you, Sam.  Yeah, this is exactly what I saw. 
[01:45:30]  So, Reverend Al, you know, did a speech.  And this is what Larry King on CNN had to do.  Some say the greatest broadcaster of all time.  Where's the hat?  I want to see a picture of Larry on his hat.  Oh, we'll get you the hat.  That was later on when they were letting their collars, well, letting their hair down.  You know, it was a little looser later on at night on CNN.  Yeah.  This is what Larry King had to say about Reverend Al's speech.  But I thought the stick out, if there was a stick out in this stick out of evenings, was Reverend Sharpton.  He exceeded himself. 
[01:46:00]  It was a great speech, well thought out, beautifully delivered.  And he had...  I can't live in this world anymore.  Am I allowed to get on a space shuttle?  What speech did he see?  Thank you.  What speech was he watching that was beautifully done and...  It was racist, agenda-driven dreck that was completely inappropriate for the moment.  It didn't sound inspired to me at all.  It did nothing for me. 
[01:46:30]  Fuck Larry King, man.  Just fucking...  Just retire.  Fuck them all in their fuckholes.  He's just awful.  He's awful.  Are you really that easily moved, you fucking irrelevant old man?  God, I can't stomach Larry King.  Get the fuck out of the seat and let Anderson Cooper do it.  Or somebody else who doesn't trip and call Lou Ferrigno.  Lou Ferragamo!  Lou Ferrari!  You fucking idiot.  Get out of your seat, put a plunger on it, and let Anderson Cooper have it.  Let him leap off a pogo stick and land on it. 
[01:47:00]  Be careful.  Larry King's a boob.  Be careful with the Anderson Cooper jokes.  They had a video of him with guns.  That motherfucker works out.  Oh, really?  It doesn't look like it when he's wearing his little suit.  He's got it.  They all do.  They all do.  They're very competitive with how they look.  Of course they are.  Holy shit.  I'm like, very competitive with how they look.  I mean, Larry King, we could take in a fight.  No problem.  Of course.  But I thought the stick out, if there was a stick out in this stick out of evenings,  was Reverend Sharpton. 
[01:47:30]  He exceeded himself.  It was a great speech.  Well thought out.  Beautifully delivered.  And he had the crowd just totally in coil, if I could call it that.  And so did Hitler.  I've never experienced that.  I've been to Staples Center many times.  This is the most extraordinary time ever.  At the Staples Center?  Yeah.  What were you there for?  Really?  When the Lakers won?  The bodily crew.  When the Lakers won the championship, that wasn't one of the greatest moments for the  Staples Center?  He was uninspiring.  And the audience wasn't, there wasn't a big rousing round of applause and a standing 
[01:48:00]  ovation.  And he did hack activists three times, say the thing three times.  It was horrid.  And it was also, he got applause on timing.  Like when he would stop, people knew it was time to clap.  Right, right, right.  It's almost like when you go, two Jews walk into a bar.  People know punchline coming.  They've been trained enough to know when to clap.  Well, I think Larry King saw a ghost.  So this video already has coming out of him. 
[01:48:30]  How many views?  Six and a half million views.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Holy shit.  And this is from last night or?  A couple of days ago.  A couple of days ago?  Within the last week.  Michael Jackson's ghost.  During CNN, Larry King interview with Jermaine Jackson.  This isn't one of these things where all of a sudden it goes, ah!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Thank God.  I get scared of those.  Those frighten me.  Ready?  Hit it.  All right, Larry.  We're inside Michael Jackson's bedroom suite with Miko Brando, our tour guide here. 
[01:49:00]  And you're looking at the doors.  And you can see the locks on the doors.  Miko, privacy was key in this room.  I know it's radio.  We'll explain where you can see this for yourself in a minute.  When the doors were open, you know, it was okay.  But when he locked, he wanted to privacy.  Give him a tour of Neverland.  He had his privacy.  Watch down the hall.  This is one of the best.  Holy shit.  It's a shadow on the wall. 
[01:49:30]  Well, someone is, you know, having fun with it.  Dude.  It scared me, though.  The music and everything.  They really did it up well.  Down the hall, you see, like, something move across, like a very faint shadow.  Sort of looks like Michael Jackson.  There could be lighting down the hall.  Well, there's probably an entire crew in there.  Right.  And they're moving around.  And they're doing lighting.  Right, right.  They probably end up in that room later.  Right.  So they're setting up.  And it's a shadow that moves across the wall. 
[01:50:00]  But it is very ghostly looking.  You know what?  The dummies out there will eat this one up, though.  Oh, they certainly will.  Eat this one up.  That's good.  It's pretty cool, though.  That is pretty creepy.  Just look up Michael Jackson's ghost.  You'll find it.  Ooh.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Were you frightened?  I had to close my eyes.  Yes.  At the terror that was unfolding in front of me.  A shadow of a grip moving across the gaffer.  I wish through Larry King's studio the ghost of relevancy would pass by. 
[01:50:30]  That'd be nice to see what that looks like in that fucking awful light, bright studio he has.  With his goddamn hat.  With his Michael Jackson hat.  We'll get the hat for you.  I just cannot stomach Larry King.  Oh, wait.  Neverland mystery solved already?  ...convinced the film captured during CNN program Inside Neverland shows Michael Jackson's ghost.  This is one of the bathrooms.  It appears to show the silhouette of a man crossing the corridor left to right before disappearing into the wall. 
[01:51:00]  The CNN footage was shot during a tour of Jackson's Neverland home a week after the 50-year-old died, although no one appeared to notice it at the time.  It adds another layer to the mystery surrounding the singer, who's perhaps seeking to offer a few more thrills even after his death.  But it says song. 
[01:51:30]  Now, Larry, we posted this video on our blog, CNN.com slash Larry King.  As always, look for that blog link, and you'll be directed right to the video so you can take a closer look at it.  We're going to show you the video again, as shot from the show that we did the other day.  And what you're looking at in this video is CNN correspondent Ted Rollins touring Michael Jackson's bedroom at Neverland Ranch.  And in the distance, when the camera aims down a hallway into the foyer and then the dining room further in the distance, you'll see a shadowy figure move across that back wall. 
[01:52:00]  Now, Larry, you were in the house.  I was in the mansion.  Several other staffers were in the mansion.  None of us, we can report, experienced, sensed, felt, saw any ghostly figures at all within Neverland Mansion, ranch, anywhere on the property.  In fact, what you see in this viral video making its way around the web is a shadow from either one of the people working in the house or from another network crew walking in front of a lighting fixer that had been set up earlier. 
[01:52:30]  We tell you again, the video itself is on CNN.com slash Larry King.  It's on our blog.  Go to the blog.  You can see the video.  They solved that mystery.  It was a shadow.  Thanks, David.  We left Miko out of that.  Miko was conducting the tour with Ted.  Did you see anything?  I do know.  After seeing the playback, I wish it was him.  It would have been great.  Would it really, you fucking creepy Lou Albano?  Who is that guy in his awful shirt?  That's Brando's son.  It looks like Jimmy Buffett's toilet paper. 
[01:53:00]  Miko, who is close friends with Michael Jackson.  I missed on that one.  I was thinking Margarita Bell.  Something about â€“  Wow.  Another thing.  We talk about how out of touch Larry King is, CNN and all these fucking places.  You have a viral video that is going crazy.  It's up to 6.5 million views.  It says CNN.  It's great marketing for CNN, great marketing for Larry King himself.  Why the fuck would you quickly go on CNN and solve it?  Why wouldn't you let that sit there for a while? 
[01:53:30]  The legs.  And then when the legs â€“ when it doesn't have legs anymore, it starts to â€“ people don't understand marketing.  Then it doesn't have legs anymore, right?  Then you pop it up again and it gets legs again when you explain what it really was.  I don't know.  Why would you solve that?  Is that on that WW thing?  Dummies.  Well, Michael Jackson has been seen in a stump too, so â€“  In a stump?  Tree stump.  Holy shit, people. 
[01:54:00]  God, humans.  And we're not even done with this.  No.  Because you got a London memorial that's happening.  You got a Harlem memorial that's happening.  I thought that was like during the Staples one.  They put a big TV up.  Nope, a whole different one.  You got the coroner's report that still has to come out, and that will create a hell of a lot of more coverage.  And then you got the indictments.  There will be indictments.  Somebody.  Somebody is. 
[01:54:30]  What?  I'm laughing.  I'm sorry.  I'm watching the Breitbart link that they put â€“ actually, I think we had a Breitbart we were joking about,  but it said radio host Opie and Anthony blast Reverend Sharpton for exploiting Jackson's death.  And then under his warning, graphic language, comedian Jim Norton joins in the discussion of Reverend Al Sharpton's role in the Jackson Memorial,  which is very funny.  It's funny that they put that in there.  It's hilarious.  They seem to be fans over there.  Yeah, or at least â€“ yeah, I think I was in trouble a couple years ago. 
[01:55:00]  Am I supposed to see Michael Jackson right now in that stump?  Yeah, right there.  Because I see â€“  Right there.  I see somebody else.  Right there.  I see like three people.  I see a cat.  And then I see â€“  I see a shark.  Yeah.  You see a shark?  Okay.  All right.  Where is it?  Jesus.  Let me play the audio.  This reminds me of the really scary footage I saw, which was a picture of Paul McCartney frowning in Heather Mills' stump.  I got goosebumps.  But, yeah.  See Michael Jackson in the tree stump. 
[01:55:30]  I did that with that.  No doubt in your mind that's Michael.  I don't see it.  That's Michael.  I think it's like really Michael.  Right there.  Images of Michael Jackson are appearing everywhere, and now one California family says the King of Pop's face is on a tree stump.  Jackson visited the area 20 years ago after a shooting at an elementary school.  Some believe he was a savior of sorts to his community, and that's why his image appeared on the tree.  Oh, oh, okay.  I see it.  He was Stockton.  He's like Mickey Mouse.  Michael Jackson meant more to us than maybe Jesus did to some people. 
[01:56:00]  I think they're both about even.  They're both icons.  Is his face cracked?  All right, we have a listener close by that could deface this tree stump.  Where's the face at?  I don't really see it.  Well, you have to be crazy to see it.  Yeah.  I see where they would think that there was hair and a fake, but it looks like a clown.  It doesn't look like Michael Jackson.  The red lips, right?  Yeah.  And one little eyeball.  It looks like a caricature.  Yeah.  It looks like Chuck Berry.  It looks nothing.  It's got a little pompadour. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, a pompadour, so his hair isn't even right.  Oh, God.  It's a tree stump is what it is.  It's a goddamn tree stump.  Stop it.  You think Corey Feldman has some hope in his heart because of...  Does he have a tree stump?  Wouldn't it surprise me if he showed up dressed like Michael?  Like he's got pit stains in the suit jacket he's been wearing for two days and just talks  to him?  Yeah.  You don't think Corey Feldman has taken off the Michael Jackson thing?  No, no.  He's still wearing the same outfit, I bet you.  I bet you he dozed off and the hat had bent up.  Straight in my head.  Do you think he's at a Starbucks somewhere out there in California? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  With the Michael Jackson outfit on?  Just in case you didn't know, I wore this last night.  How you doing?  It's tough.  It's been tough.  It's been a rough few days.  Yeah, yeah.  A few weeks.  You know, hey.  Sure it's been rough.  You know, we're going to get by.  We're going to get through this.  But, yeah, it's tough.  Why can't we find Corey Feldman audio?  You're a pain.  Some blogger definitely talked to him somewhere.  Is Otto here yet?  I don't know.  We'll take a break and we'll find out.  Otto.  Otto, Otto, and George joining the program next.  And Sharon Osbourne calling later to Pro-America's Got Talent. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I've been watching that show.  I'm in.  I like it.  It's all right.  Mindless.  You know.  Fun.  Silly.  I have to tingle.  So do I.  Oh!  New production piece from Derek and Steve.  A little gypsy for everybody.  Oh!  Oh, we'll give you a little laugh right now.  Love, Jimsy.  The Adventures of Jimsy.  Coming up on the next Jimsy ME, Jimsy investigates the death of an all-star athlete.  That girl went out and bought a gun, Sam. 
[01:58:00]  We knew she had ill intent.  What could drive a young mistress to murder?  She got a hold of that big black dick and she went crazy, Sam.  She'd only had white and Iranian ones.  They never hit bottom, Sam.  Steve McNair hit bottom.  But first, an old case resurfaces and Jimsy must tie up some loose ends.  Give me my members-only jacket.  I gotta find Abigail.  She's a very troubled girl.  The clock is ticking.  Can Jimsy get there in time? 
[01:58:30]  He was gonna marry her and then her flat-ass friend came over to my boat and I didn't see her from the side.  I just saw two breaths materialize in thin air.  And finally, Jimsy must choose between the path of his career and the road to his heart.  Detective Monaghan has the paperwork.  I'm so as my homoerotic boss.  Quick, tickle my balls with your mustache.  It feels good.  All in the next Jimsy ME.  Murder.  It was premeditated.  Murder.  Ah, continuing. 
[01:59:00]  Otto from Otto and George.  Well, you got George, too.  I brought George today.  Oh, George.  How are you three skinny pricks doing, all right?  We're doing all right there, George.  Yeah, have some blueberries with some fucking strychnine on it.  Die.  I love you guys.  It's so good to be back.  Yeah, do you?  It really is.  This is your first time in the new digs?  Yeah, it is.  God damn.  It's good.  It's good.  Are you guys happy up here, or is there any discord, or?  So what do you think of the Michael Jackson memorial? 
[01:59:30]  Screw that dead dancing monkey in the ground already.  Enough already.  I haven't seen as many black people crying since KFC canceled the fucking dollar menu.  George wasn't a fan of Michael Jackson.  That's one scratch that one off.  Don't let the sun go down on me.  All right.  Otto, you watched the memorial?  Yeah, how can you not watch it?  What were some of the highlights for you? 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  The wearing the gloves, he was a creepy ghoul.  I mean, he was admittedly good at what he did, but just a creepy pedophile, right?  To make it a sideshow like that.  Yeah.  It's like a big sideshow and ticket lotteries for people to get into an arena.  It's a big cash cow for them, right?  Yeah.  It's got to be something.  And how about this one?  The fans, they want the fans to pay for the whole thing.  Yeah.  Did they make this big deal out of Elvis' death?  There weren't as many channels then, right? 
[02:00:30]  Well, that's the problem, but it was huge for the time.  It was huge?  Yeah, absolutely.  They did all this with Elvis?  Yeah.  I don't remember all this bullshit.  Well, you didn't have the social networking.  We had three fucking TV channels back then.  Yeah, they'd show you a news clip of a giant funeral or a giant, you know, it just, it  was, the information was, you didn't have 30 channels competing for advertising dollars,  so it was, it was different.  They didn't need to show it 24 hours.  Basically, if Elvis died today, it would be just as big, if not bigger, probably bigger.  The day that Michael died, though, was weird, because, you know, Farrah Fawcett croaked 
[02:01:00]  in the morning, and he went, I was, I was in the boardwalk in Point Pleasant when I heard  Michael Jackson died, and it's like, you know, who's going to die next?  Patrick Swayze, Dick Clark, Patrick Swayze, Dick Clark, it's Karl Mulden by a nose.  Sorry.  Poor Farrah Fawcett.  We forgot that she even died.  Yeah, I know.  Most people just assume she's still battling that dumb ass cancer of hers.  Ass cancer?  It was ass cancer.  It wasn't he?  It was?  It was, yeah.  Tearing the ass out of her.  It's tearing the ass. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I think they finally squeezed in, like, 10 minutes for Farrah Fawcett in between  the Michael Jackson coverage.  God, is that all you guys have been talking about since?  Has it happened?  Well, today, definitely, and yesterday, definitely.  When are they going to plant him already?  I know.  Well, who even knows where he is?  Controversy.  He was definitely not in that coffin.  He wasn't in the coffin?  They haven't said it officially, but it's obvious.  Because another thing, after the memorial, everyone left and just left a coffin there.  Really?  Really?  I think people forgot, like, oh, fuck, we've got to make believe he's still in there.  We've got to get this coffin out of here. 
[02:02:00]  Yep.  They kind of just left it as everyone sort of started leaving.  Yeah.  What do you think the last thing would be to, you know, carry your dead brother out?  At an actual funeral, yeah.  The coffin leaves before the mourners, yeah.  Yeah.  It does, right?  I think so.  I don't know.  I've always walked out.  I never saw them.  No.  You all walk out of the establishment, and then you go to the place, and then they come  in.  Because I've been a pallbearer, and you wait until everybody goes.  They don't actually, you don't watch them cart the box out.  Yeah, that's true.  After everybody files out, then you go in there, and you all grab it. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  On three.  Well, when they started saying that he was going to be buried at Forest Lawn, I'm like,  there's no fucking way.  That's just, yeah.  They want another Elvis situation.  They want another Graceland.  They just got to figure out where that's going to be.  Didn't he sell the property, though?  It's a corporation, and Michael Jackson owned something like 10%, 15% at the time of his  death.  So he still had a piece of that.  But the problem with Neverland, Ant knows California more than anyone in this room.  That place is so out of the way that it'd be a pain in the ass for people to go and see 
[02:03:00]  it like they do in Graceland.  They're explaining Graceland, where you get off a plane, you have some barbecue, and it's  right there.  It's very easy, and then you're back on a plane.  Makes it easy for the fans.  Oh, I see.  Which means it makes it easy for you to collect a lot of money if you're the family, right?  Yeah.  So I bet you it's going to be Gary, Indiana.  His birthplace?  I bet you they go Gary, Indiana.  That's a shithole, though, man.  How far is Neverland from L.A.?  They said 100 miles.  100 miles.  Which could be...  Double. 
[02:03:30]  Double.  It's in less than two hours.  But it's in the middle of nowhere.  They'll put stuff up.  They'll put Howard Johnson's there.  Yeah.  They'll build a hotel.  Oh, yeah.  They will.  Casino.  Nah, they're thinking cash.  But Gary, Indiana.  Who the fuck's going there?  People will at least go to L.A.  It's a tremendous tourist spot.  I'm telling you, Jimmy.  When I say it's out of nowhere.  It's the scene of his first beating.  They're going to make it Gary, Indiana, right up in your car and you get punched by his father.  There'll be some Disney animatronic Joe just punching him in the face. 
[02:04:00]  But this is how Michael Jackson was...  But he should have been buried.  Choreography.  He should have been buried yesterday or today and there's no...  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  So they're just going to have the body on ice for another week or two until they figure this shit out.  Were you shocked when he died or were you...  Yeah.  It was one of those things where you're like, what?  Yeah.  And I was shocked that the drug allegations stooped me.  They kept that quiet.  I saw him walking around like a zombie, but I thought he was kind of playing up to the media a little bit.  I didn't know how deep his drug abuse went.  Total.  No clue. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Dude, he traveled with an anesthesiologist.  He did?  You didn't hear that one yet?  So he liked to go as far, like as close to death as you can go and just be totally zonked out.  Yeah, like a drip that would be put in him.  He did.  And the guy just monitoring him.  And I guess he'd go to sleep and someone monitored him and then...  And then they woke him up when it was time.  And then sometimes you wake up, sometimes you don't wake up.  He was one of those guys that didn't want to grow old.  Yeah, he slept in that hyperbolic chamber.  It kind of makes sense that he died young.  Yeah.  Because you can't imagine old Michael Jackson, right? 
[02:05:00]  No.  Coming out.  Imagine the Michael Jackson we had.  And people are saying Gary, Indiana is a shithole.  I've never been there.  I'm sure it is.  It is.  I'm sure it is.  The murder capital of the country were top three.  It was murder.  Gary, Indiana, yes.  It was murder.  It was murder.  It was murder.  They found the bullets on his chest, Sam.  It was, I think, Gary, Indiana.  But good.  She's a girl.  Neverland is.  I love this Jack Plugman.  You love Jack Plugman?  Let me see that.  It's a great Jack Plugman.  There was a girl, and she had to be found. 
[02:05:30]  It's all I do.  It's all I do with little hands.  Yeah.  I think that Gary and Indiana was a murder capital at one point.  Okay.  Well, Neverland is 150 miles from L.A., they're saying that.  It's a long drive.  But is there another airport close to it?  With nothing there.  There's nothing.  Dude, it's just ranches.  Each person has, like, 100 fucking acres or something crazy.  Maybe even more.  And you'd need, like, a main road going through a bunch of people's ranches to get there.  That's a lot of money there, man.  I got this book. 
[02:06:00]  I got this book I wrote that I think it's a good time to probably release it.  But it's a trilogy of books about three great black men in history.  The first book is about Martin Luther King, civil rights leader.  Second book is about, of course, Michael Jackson, superstar of the 80s.  And the third book is about President Obama.  And I got a great title for it.  Oh, no.  What do you call in the book?  Three niggers.  Oh, my God.  Am I out of here?  Oh, my God.  That's George from Otto and George. 
[02:06:30]  George isn't even alive.  Please don't fire us.  Don't get mad.  It's a melting pot.  Yeah.  What else did you like about the memorial, Otto?  Or didn't like?  Or what just jumped out at you?  I was watching it in a bar restaurant yesterday.  And just the comments from the average Joe at the bar just saying, you know, he was good at what he did.  But, you know, he was a ghoul.  And he was, you know, he was a pedophile.  And they're kind of forgetting about that, you know. 
[02:07:00]  It's like one of the worst things you can do as a human being.  It's to touch a child.  Even hardcore criminals find that, you know, offensive.  Yeah.  The short eyes.  We've all heard the stories.  If you go to jail for, like, touching a kid, you know, they get pissed off at you and they fuck you up real good in the joint.  There's a chance that he didn't actually have sex with some of them.  That it was just a Peter Pan thing that he claims.  But there had to be a sexual component to it.  It's just such a bizarre thing to even want to hang out with kids. 
[02:07:30]  Even if you don't want to fuck them.  To want to just hang out with them is weird.  Like, why would you want to surround yourself with kids?  Even if you don't have sexual.  He almost came off as asexual to me.  Like, I can't picture him wanting to fuck a girl.  And I can't picture him wanting to blow a guy.  I can't picture him taking his dick out for anything other than to get the wee-wee away from him.  It just struck me as such a bizarre asexual dude.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's flaky either way.  If you're fucking kids, you're a piece of shit.  And if you're just hanging out with them, you're weird.  And the whole kid, I like kids, Autumn. 
[02:08:00]  But after an hour or two hanging out with kids, you're like, holy shit, let's go do something else.  Even relatives.  Why would you want to?  Yes.  Even relatives.  Even my nephews and nieces that I love to death.  But after an hour or two, fuck that.  Right already.  Let's go do something else.  You guys want to hear the Brooke Shields?  Yeah.  You want to hear the Brooke Shields?  Little Brooke Shields.  We're kind of going through all the memorial stuff.  She's like 6, 6, 8, 6, 7, 6, 8.  This guy at the bar is going, she's a big girl.  She's like 6, 8, 6, 9.  What the fuck are you talking about?  That's 5, 10, maybe. 
[02:08:30]  Right here.  6, 8, 6, 9.  Why would you go?  You moron.  Why would you see this at a bar?  Well, actually, that would probably be a lot of fun.  This guy's just hearing the average comment about it.  It's weird.  And this was...  He was on the Food Channel.  Enough.  Squimbing the ground.  This was a girl that just knew him when she was 13.  Right.  And that's who they drag up there.  Well, they had no one else to drag up there.  Fucking Gene Kelly was a better dancer than him.  I don't remember the hoopla when he croaked, you know? 
[02:09:00]  It was Gene Kelly's memorial.  Fantastic dancer.  Didn't get one.  I've never seen him dance.  Seeing it in the rain, he was amazing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember Malcolm McDowell's version I preferred.  Yeah.  I heard he hated that.  He hated that movie.  Oh, he must have.  He writes this...  He sings this wonderful dance routine, and it's using a rape scene in a fucking British  movie.  Yeah, he was not cool with that.  And I'm ready for love, kick.  Yeah.  Ready for love.  And then Dim's all off cue.  Yeah.  But I did hear that Fred Astaire, when they asked him about breakdancing, he didn't go 
[02:09:30]  off and say, that's bullshit.  It's not dancing.  He actually said that.  He goes, you know what?  That's hard.  I wish I was young enough to be able to do that.  He was acknowledging that there's some skill with that shit, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Because you figure an old guy like that would just go, fuck, that's not dancing, you know?  Yeah.  He was just scared.  Yeah.  He was scared.  Yeah.  He was scared of the darkies.  Well, here we go.  Let's get into Brook Shields.  Last time Brook Shields saw Michael Jackson was 1991, so, you know, getting all the-  She's like 6'9". 
[02:10:00]  6'8", 6'9".  6'9".  Good girl.  Does he know about Corey Feldman yet?  Let's get the first clip, by the way.  I don't want to make the whole thing sad.  All right.  We got to explain.  Corey Feldman died?  No, no.  He might as well.  You know, Oscar Mayer died.  The third.  Oscar Mayer the third?  Well, the third Oscar Mayer guy.  The baloney guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I thought he was the original two, but there was three.  Giving America colon cancer.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  50 years.  There was three?  That's what I read.  Which Oscar Mayer guy?  Well, he was in charge, obviously, of the family thing. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, okay.  He was 95, died in an old age home.  Oh, God.  He must have been great.  Yeah.  He made all that money for all his family members, and what did they do?  They shoved him into an old age home so they could enjoy his riches.  Because you think those rich, like, really rich guys like that eat their own product?  They know it's shit, right?  They wouldn't serve that, right?  Chicken wing guy died of a massive coronary at a very early age.  Who?  The guy that made...  Who invented chicken wings in Buffalo. 
[02:11:00]  Buffalo wings, yeah.  So you've got to think he was eating the product.  God invented the chicken wings.  Part of a massive heart attack.  Yeah.  Here's Brooke Shields.  I was 13 when we met, and from that day on, our friendship grew.  Michael always knew that he could count on me to support him or be his date.  Date.  Beard.  And that we...  Stop already.  You know, she's 6'8", 6'9".  Yeah.  6'9", 6'8". 
[02:11:30]  Beard, of course.  She has zero sex appeal.  Really?  I think she looked good yesterday.  Wow, I thought she looked good, too.  Yeah, man.  Beautiful features, but just no steam.  There's nothing steamy about her.  There's no personality.  Oh, and she bombed horribly with half the shit she was trying to...  Yeah.  Did she?  Oh, she was going for some big laughs.  You'll see.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You'll see.  Him or be his date.  She's a duller.  And that we would have fun no matter where we were.  Well, that's the point of...  Unless it was a bedroom.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  And maybe it was because...  We both understood what it was like...  She's smuggling the nose out in her jeans.  ...being in the spotlight from a very, very young age.  Like sleeper.  I used to tease him, and I'd say...  You know, I started when I was 11 months old.  You're a slacker.  You were what, five?  Boo!  Boo!  That's her first bomb. 
[02:12:30]  That was a joke?  Yes, that was...  She was going for a bad laugh.  These are the jokes here, folks.  Laugh it up, lady.  I laugh when you come in.  I need a tissue.  Anthony needs a tissue.  I need a tissue.  Oh, my God.  I just don't want to drip snot out of my nose.  Oh.  That's all.  Yeah.  Here.  Hmm.  Chester's liver. 
[02:13:00]  Oscar Mayer died in an old age home, trying to remember what his balona's first name is.  Very nice.  Let's not...  Death is really good for you radio guys, isn't it?  Fuck yeah.  You get like four or five days out of your shit, right?  And I also said 2009 would be the year of the celebrity death.  Now we've lost Mr. Oscar Mayer Wiener guy.  Yeah.  Here's more Brooke Shields.  Wouldn't it be funny if he had bigger memorials than Michael Jackson and a bigger fan outpouring?  Is there anybody that you would cry if they died tomorrow, like music or movies or anybody 
[02:13:30]  that would actually affect you?  God damn, is that a good question.  Let me think.  I remember being all weepy-like when John Candy died.  I was very upset by that.  Yeah.  I went out and I rented Uncle Buck and Trains and Planes and just watched his movies.  I felt like I lost a friend.  Belushi was a big one.  Really?  That was pretty big.  Sam Tennyson for me.  I cried when Pryor died, even though I knew he was sick.  George Carlin made me sad.  Oh yeah, me too.  That was a very sad thing.  That made me really sad.  Very sad. 
[02:14:00]  Because we sort of got to know him at the end of his life.  It was kind of neat.  Miserable bastard that he was.  Was he?  Yeah.  I mean, for me, Kurt Cobain, believe it or not.  Kurt, yeah.  That bothered me a lot.  But I mean, that was obvious that was going to happen.  Who else?  Who would I cry if they died?  Ozzy, of course.  Yeah.  Ali.  I would cry if Ali died.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even though I know he's an old man.  Did you meet him?  Never mind, Ali, no.  God, I don't think there's a celebrity out there now that I would cry over.  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton.  I think if Clint Eastwood died, I'd be pretty upset. 
[02:14:30]  Really?  I've been paying to see his movie.  That's true.  He is an old Alta Cocker.  I don't get sad for the old people dying, ever.  No.  Ever.  You reflect a little.  That's true.  My grandma lived a great life, and I was celebrating her life at the wake and the funeral, and I  had fucking cousins just falling down on the coffin.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, what do you want?  How old was she?  Was she in her 90s?  She was in her 90s.  Guess the little blonde girl from Poltergeist. 
[02:15:00]  Jean Benet Ramsey.  Oh, God.  It's a little broken up about that.  Not a hint of an emotion in this guy to my right.  He still looks fucking pretty good, though, considering he started Motown.  Yeah.  He had to tell everyone which songs he fucking wrote for Michael Jackson.  Did Michael Jackson have any black friends other than other Motown artists like Diana  Ross?  I don't even think these people were their friends.  No?  His friends.  He just had weird, you know, fucking Elizabeth Taylor, fucking bizarre icons.  Weirdo people.  Weirdo pill poppy. 
[02:15:30]  Liza.  Yeah, Liza.  More pills.  Where was she?  Yeah, where was Liza?  Where were all the original?  A lot of people didn't show up.  Because they had reputations.  We did this break already.  Liza's reputation is horrible.  Yeah, but she doesn't think it's as bad as Michael Jackson.  You know.  I think she was trying to convince people that David Guest is, in fact, a living creature.  Yuck.  What a weirdo.  David Guest.  I know.  I don't know whether to love him or hate him.  It's beyond fruit.  I do neither.  I don't know what he is.  I'm mad that...  So the Kenny came into what you call a green room now and goes... 
[02:16:00]  It's our office.  Did you hear Michael Jackson die?  It was very funny.  Dead, dead.  Yeah, such an ass.  What about Paul McCartney?  They made a couple of tunes together, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he died?  No, no.  I mean, where was he?  Oh, sure.  Did he even say anything?  He got fucked out of the royalties of the Beatles records.  He just got pissed off about that.  That's true.  He's probably a little angry.  Fuck.  Dude, the list is real long of people that should have been there that weren't.  Yeah.  And then they did this whole We Are The World thing at the end of it with backup singers. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  With karaoke singers.  Like, really good karaoke singers.  Oh, really?  Yes.  They said it was going to be star-studded.  I liked him.  He was a cute kid in the Jackson 5, you know?  He was a talented cute kid.  He had some soul way beyond his years.  It was cool to listen to.  I never, like...  I like that song, I'll Be There, because it's running through my head all morning.  Yeah.  But I don't...  It was always hard for me to listen to the Jackson 5.  To hear a kid singing about adult stuff and adult relationships, I never liked that. 
[02:17:00]  I never liked...  I can never be moved...  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Oh, no, that I love.  Especially when I can't say the yeses properly.  Yeah.  No, I never liked it when...  It just never struck me as genuine.  Look over your shoulder.  That's a warning.  Yeah.  Even though I'm not a NASCAR fan with Dale Earnhardt Jr., I'm still thinking of people  that...  Oh, okay.  That one was like, wow.  I didn't feel sad about it.  Jr. is still alive.  Huh?  I mean...  Yeah, right.  I'm sorry.  Dale Earnhardt.  John Lennon's death, I remember...  Oh, wow.  That was a heavy death.  I remember going and hanging out with my friends. 
[02:17:30]  We smoked pot and listened to the White Album.  We were just...  We were completely shocked.  That was a heavy one.  That was a bad one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think I ever...  No?  You don't have a...  Oh, we're celebrities?  It's okay.  You're a cyborg, I think.  No, no.  I'm just trying to...  And when Tessio got it, I thought they should...  Yeah, yeah.  How about Ivan...  Got him off the hook.  For old times' sake.  Ivan Demjeniuk, Ant?  How about when he dies in Detroit?  Yeah, I was a little...  You know something?  Okay.  When I was watching Downfall and Hitler gave the little cyanide pill to his dog. 
[02:18:00]  That made you sad.  It kind of felt bad.  Poor little puppy.  The girl, the daughter, it looks like she's going to be a piece of ass, though.  Michael's daughter.  Seems to be whatever.  That's the big story.  She's very pretty.  Yeah.  Well, they made her in a lab.  Wouldn't you pick the best ingredients?  Is that his sperm?  No.  No.  Not one strand of DNA.  No?  It's the dermatologist.  It was his dermatologist and then that broad.  So it's just an adoption.  Okay.  So bizarre.  Yeah.  He's a freak. 
[02:18:30]  Someone's saying that a female invented the buffalo wing.  I actually have a story involving his father when I was working at the Riviera in Vegas  for Steve Scharippa from Sopranos.  Yeah.  He told me that Michael Jackson's father lives in town.  He's pissed off because of my Michael Jackson material and he's coming to the club.  And I go, Steve, should I do the bit?  He goes, I heard he was a golden glove boxer.  You might bust your face open.  And he said, he had those, when I met him, he had those yellow eyes, like from a cheap 
[02:19:00]  fucking devil movie from the seventies, you know, starring Ernest Borgnine with a Satan  with a yellow contacts.  He had that.  Really?  Those devil eyes.  And he had this Chinese bodyguard who looked like Oddjob from Goldfinger.  And I did the bit.  Nothing happened.  I go, well, let him punch me.  What the fuck?  You know?  I didn't feel like, like if one of the Kennedys was in the audience, I wouldn't do my Kennedy  bit because I, in, in good conscience, it's a, it's a tasteless joke and it's, it's a cheap 
[02:19:30]  laugh.  But the Mike, you know, Michael, I felt he had it coming.  I just didn't.  What was the line that you do when you're acting about Michael Jackson?  Some of those kids were so young after they sucked his dick, he had to burp him.  That's a fucking great joke.  Holy shit.  And what a great joke.  The whole crowd turned and looked at him to see what he was doing.  And he really was in the audience?  Yeah.  What did he do when you did a joke?  Wow.  He went, oh!  He didn't, he didn't do anything.  He just, you know, fucking.  Went home and punched Michael in the face again.  Did he, uh, but did he, was he, how was he when you met him? 
[02:20:00]  Was he awful to you?  Yeah, I didn't speak to him.  I just saw him walking in.  I kind of averted.  That takes balls to do that line in front of him.  But, um, yeah, Sherripper was, uh, kind of antagonizing me.  He's going, don't push you out.  Do it.  Do it.  You know?  Do it.  Come on.  Great.  He's probably trying to start an incident in the club and get some press.  Yeah.  He was hoping to give you a good sock in the eye.  Yeah.  Well, back to Brooke, uh, Shields.  Sucked his cock.  He had to burp him.  Yeah.  I've heard that joke before.  It's just such a fucking good one.  I thought that was my best joke. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  That's a great line.  Oh, hand.  Let's listen to Brooke Shields do some more bombing.  Of course.  Going for the laughs.  We never filmed a video or recorded a song.  But what we did do.  Everything was laugh.  It was always a competition.  Was it?  To see who could make the other one laugh more or be sillier.  His sense of humor was delightful.  And he was very mischievous. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  I remember, uh.  Playground.  It was the night before Elizabeth Taylor's wedding.  Wouldn't it be great if she had, like, really barbaric jokes?  And there was an old age home.  And Michael set the entrance on fire.  And we watched the elderly run out on fire and fall in the concrete.  How funny would that be?  She had terrible fucking memories.  But first we'd suffocate a few with their pillows.  Yes.  And so then the next night.  The burning orphanage. 
[02:21:30]  I filled a balloon with urine.  And we threw it off the balcony onto cheering fans.  Trying to be silly.  We would poke people with AIDS needles.  Yes.  We called in a bomb threat to Eastern Airlines.  Oh, we laughed.  He was so mischievous.  Michael was very mischievous.  Sometimes he would steal his father's car and then rear end people and drink a bottle of booze and get out.  All right.  You see me running out of steam on that one?  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  I felt it too.  It's okay.  I remember it was the night before Elizabeth Taylor's wedding.  And he had called me prior and asked if I would join him.  He didn't want to be alone for all the festivities.  And it was the night before the big day.  And Michael and I tried to sneak in to get the first peek of the dress.  And we were just giggling like crazy.  And we almost passed out in hysterics when we realized that Elizabeth was actually asleep in the bed. 
[02:22:30]  We thought she was in an entirely different room.  Uh-huh.  There's no laugh there.  That was supposed to be a big laugh.  That was, when she told that, I was like, this is the worst story.  Yeah.  That's supposed to be a humorous anecdote.  Yeah.  It was Jim Belushi sleeping.  It was Elizabeth Taylor. 
[02:23:00]  It was actually asleep in the bed.  Crazy gluter cunt shot.  On her wedding night.  It would be funny.  Michael took a big watery dump in her wig.  And she put it on.  And she was giving her vows.  And it looked like she had pudding on her face.  Why is it funny that an old bra's in bed sleeping?  It isn't.  Because they're giggling.  Well, look.  In that moment when you sneak in to look at her dress.  Which I'm sure, you know, that's not an indicator of Michael's preferences. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And you see that the old lady is sleeping in the bed.  All right.  I can see that being a funny moment for two teenagers.  The sheets are kicked off.  Just a big thatch of gray pubes.  Yeah.  She was asleep.  That was funny.  And laying next to her with a giant erection was Yafit Kodo.  He had fucked the wig.  All of Elizabeth Taylor.  It was on the floor next to his construction boots. 
[02:24:00]  So are you saying that this story should have been told in front of a billion people?  Yeah.  It wasn't worth it.  It was a horrible story.  Horrible story.  Well, I don't know.  Let's get the reaction.  Hysterics, when we realized that Elizabeth was actually asleep in the bed, we thought she  was in an entirely different room.  Yeah.  And we had to laugh and sneak out.  Then at the point of the wedding when there was the first dance.  Be more funny.  Basically, we had to joke that we were the mother and father of the bride. 
[02:24:30]  This is going great.  I'm uncomfortable.  That was three massive bombs.  Wow.  That is bad.  Better sit through that to hear Stevie Wonder, huh?  For those fucking prices.  Stevie Wonder singing the creepy song.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Why do you have to leave in the summertime or something?  I wanted to hear a funny Liz Taylor wedding story.  I know.  Well, she continues, Jimmy. 
[02:25:00]  There's more clarity.  More laughs to be had.  Well, who was she marrying?  Was this when she married that guy, Larry?  What was his name?  The seventh or eighth guy?  Oh, the guy with the weird perm.  Creepy guy?  Yeah.  Like Sammy Hagar with a big cock.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Hmm.  Here's Brooke talking about Michael's glove.  Oh, this gets a great response.  Oh, my.  Hats.  Yes, it may have seemed very odd to the outside, but we made it fun and we made it real. 
[02:25:30]  When he started wearing the glove, I was like, what's up with the glove?  I was like, look, if you're going to hold my hand, I better be the non-gloved one because  sequins really hurt me.  He would dig in.  Oh, he would dig in.  He'd just shake his head and he would just smile.  Ed Norton?  Yeah.  He loved to be teased.  Yeah.  Loved to be teased, I bet. 
[02:26:00]  Every time we went to Disney.  Yes, we'd tie him up and show Zoom.  Zoom.  Zoom.  Well, I asked about the glove and he took off the left one and he had on a ring and  it said, in the name of the Senate and the people of Rome, that he got Proculus up on  one knee.  We got it, Jim.  Wow.  I got a good laugh, though.  What's up with the glove?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good...  What's up with the glove was her high point.  Yeah.  That was it right there. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, but one for five in the majors.  I know.  They're sending you back down, my friend.  She was terrible.  Terrible.  That's double-A ball right there.  You're rating her as a stand-up?  Yeah, I mean, she was friends with a guy who died.  How about this?  They don't go for the jokes in front of a billion people.  You gotta come up with her funny story.  You go with what you're strong at.  When she was 13.  Yeah.  That's who they get?  Someone that knew her when she was 13.  And then what?  How about something when you were older?  Oh, we never talked again.  Yeah.  It's sad that no one really knew the guy in the last, I don't know, 20 years, 15 years. 
[02:27:00]  God, I wish there was one guy that had a really good guy story.  So we're on a roll, right?  I walk in a hotel.  Mike's balls deep in this girl's asshole.  She's puking off the side of the bed.  The glove's on one bed.  No, you'll never hear that story.  No.  Hell no.  He was often referred to as the king.  But the Michael that I knew always reminded me more of the little prince.  Yes.  Thinking of him now, I'd like to share a passage from the book. 
[02:27:30]  Think of all the pussy he could have had and didn't.  It's a disgusting thought to him.  The hottest pussy in the world shoved in front of his face.  We go, yuck.  Yeah.  Don't want any of that.  What was the book she talked about?  The book.  Oh, the Bible?  There's only one book.  No.  It would be funny if she pulled out happy endings.  Happy endings.  What moves me so deeply about this sleeping prince? 
[02:28:00]  Is his loyalty to a flower.  Uh-huh.  What?  What does that mean?  The image of a rose shining within him like the flame within a lamp.  Hickory dickory dog.  You know.  What the fuck is this?  I don't understand this stuff.  Puddle of AIDS, right?  She needs to cut out with the Seinfeld bit.  What's with the glove?  Hey, what's with the glove?  Elaine Kramer.  We should have hit that. 
[02:28:30]  Fuck.  Even when he's asleep.  Yeah.  Quick, we start the quote.  I'm sorry.  I actually don't know what quote this is.  Sleeping prince.  What book does she mean?  This is not the Bible.  No.  No.  What book is this, Danny?  The Little Prince.  It's the book of shit.  Oh.  The book.  The image of a rose shining within him like the flame within a lamp.  What?  Even when he's asleep.  Sleep.  And I realized he was even more fragile than I had thought. 
[02:29:00]  Oh.  Lamps must be protected.  Lamps are good.  A gust of wind can blow them out.  Yeah.  Blow.  Michael's sensitivity was even more extraordinary than his talent.  How do you know?  And his true truth resided in his heart.  Nice.  As the little prince also said, eyes are blind.  You have to look with the heart.  What's most important is invisible. 
[02:29:30]  What?  Michael saw everything with his heart.  I'm stupid.  That's why literature sucks.  He saw everything with his heart.  How do you do that?  Look through a rib cage?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I'm stupid.  Basically saying that Michael, I think what she's saying there is that Michael saw things  with his heart.  He wanted to hang out with kids.  No, no.  Really.  He didn't see it as being inappropriate because he was looking towards how he felt for them  and how he related to them. 
[02:30:00]  So for him, it wasn't an issue of other people's perception.  It was how he felt.  Oh, is that her just trying to justify what he was doing?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm guessing.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And finally, this from Brooke Shields.  To his family, his brothers and sisters, Catherine, Joe.  Sorry I didn't call Michael Jackson in the last 20 years.  Yeah.  But he scared the shit out of us.  He was a freak.  And to his children, Prince, Paris, Blanket. 
[02:30:30]  Blanket.  My prayers are with you.  That just sounds...  Fucking Blanket.  Prince, Paris, Blanket.  I can't get enough of Blanket.  Shovel.  Blanket's a kid's name, right?  Yes.  Dude, he was scared to be around humans in sunlight.  Did you see him?  He's like, please put me back in the closet.  He's going, hey, if Brooke calls, I'm not home.  Blanket, yes.  He's kept in the dark like a small, loving mushroom.  Blanket, kid is odd.  I'm sorry. 
[02:31:00]  Baby dangling.  Do you think Corey Feldman was wiping away a tear at this point?  I bet you Corey wiped it away with the back of his knuckle.  He didn't want to do the full.  He probably just wiped it away with the back of his knuckle.  Yeah, I'm sure Corey was hurt during this.  Should we explain this to Otto?  I don't understand.  Corey showed up dressed as Michael Jackson.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, it was really not embarrassing at all.  It was his place.  What about these guys, the ones who knew him  when they were a kid like Coley Culkin?  And Webster.  We had no sex.  We had no sex. 
[02:31:30]  You didn't ask anything.  Why are you coming out with that?  The first thing out of your mouth.  We didn't fuck.  You didn't fuck me.  Whoa, hey.  Nobody asked anything.  We weren't going there.  We were asking about your latest movie.  Exactly.  And to his children.  Prince.  Paris.  Blanket.  My prayers are with you.  Horse blanket.  Don't you think the family's first order of business should be to give that kid a real name?  I know.  Yeah.  All right.  The first thing we're doing, blanket, is we're turning it into a gym. 
[02:32:00]  Blanket.  Oven mitt, doily, blanket.  Your name is Bob.  Who's watching Tupperware?  To the children, comforter, pillowcase, toilet sheet cover.  Wow, Michael really cared about his kids.  He named his kid after the first thing he saw.  And to the twins, throw pillows.  Right.  Prince.  Paris.  Blanket.  My prayers are with you.  Michael's favorite song was not one of the countless masterpieces that he gave us. 
[02:32:30]  Which one?  But it was a song that Charlie Chaplin wrote for the movie Modern Times.  It's called Smile.  And there's a line in the song that says,  Smile, though your heart is aching.  Today, although our hearts are aching,  we need to love that. 
[02:33:00]  There it is.  There it is.  It's a song written by Fatty Arbuckle.  It's called Smile, though your vagina's being pulled out with a Coke bottle.  In E.  A nice modern song you picked there.  In E minor.  Let's have some fun with this clip here.  Today, although our hearts are aching,  we need to look up. 
[02:33:30]  And he is undoubtedly perched in a crescent moon.  With two bad knees.  I just want to play baseball.  He's perched in a crescent moon.  Yeah.  Is he?  That's where dead people are.  What is the smile, by the way?  What's the song?  I don't know.  Let's get into that.  But first, I just got some info.  Hot is breaking.  Smile.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We got the number one Google trend today. 
[02:34:00]  Let's go there.  What is it?  Reverend R-E-V.  Rev Al is racist.  Right.  Is that how it is?  He is.  Oh, is a racist.  You got to get that A in there.  Rev R-E-V.  Al is a racist.  Number one Google trend.  What about the number two Google trend, Jimmy?  Yours isn't doing as well as the Rev Al is a racist.  No, it's mine.  Corey Feldman is hurting.  He is hurting.  He is hurting.  He is hurting.  Corey Feldman is hurting.  He is hurting. 
[02:34:30]  Maybe people are having a tough time spelling Corey Feldman.  Yes.  But we want the number two Google trend to be Corey Feldman is hurting.  He is hurting.  So now what about, I just, I never heard the song Smile.  It's driving me nuts.  I just want people to continue fucking bombing.  Rev R-E-V.  Al is a racist.  Okay.  Redone it.  I never heard it.  I appreciate it.  You know a little, you're a Charlie Chaplin.  Aren't you there, Otto?  Somewhat.  What do you need to know?  The Smile song.  What is it about?  How's he doing? 
[02:35:00]  Actually, what is it about?  Look at Pat from Unaki.  Laugh through the ring.  That's exactly what the song's about.  Really?  Pat from Unaki.  Yeah.  Wow.  Smile though your heart is breaking.  He's like, funny guy.  Meanwhile, inside, just, just a fucking disastrous mess.  It's my favorite song.  It's about a nine-toed fool.  Yeah.  You know, once that trailer door shuts at night and it's all quiet, you just know he's  boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  How do you know that Pat chews his knuckle and goes, fuck? 
[02:35:30]  I think we passed the Brooke Shields crying clip too quickly because Billy B.  You guys keep it hot in here.  All right.  Yeah.  It was too cold.  Now it's too hot.  Turn up the AC.  No, I'm on.  Billy B. from Queens writes, is this Brooke Shields or Mike Schmidt?  Yeah, I know.  That's what he sounded like.  And then we got to do the wrestling one too.  It's still real to me.  Yeah.  Pat from Unaki.  I do think at one point though, I do want to hear. 
[02:36:00]  Well, here's Smile.  I do want to hear Andrew's take on it.  I understand Big A is here and I imagine he has a very moving take on Michael.  Absolutely.  I don't doubt it at all.  We'll get him on after the break.  But first, a little taste of.  Smile.  Well, this is Nat King Cole's version.  Yeah.  Oh, I know this one.  The big intro.  I hate Nat King Cole.  In these days.  You hate Nat King Cole?  Yes!  Though your heart is aching.  It's a Nat King Cole over here. 
[02:36:30]  Smile even though it's breaking.  When there are clouds in the sky.  You'll get by.  If you smile.  Song stinks.  Through your fear and sorrow.  It's good.  Be a phony.  Have a dumb smile plastered on your fucking stupid face.  It's pretty much, you know, like laugh clown laugh.  It's the same fucking shit.  It was probably written during the Depression or something. 
[02:37:00]  Well, Chaplin wrote it.  People didn't have much to look forward to.  Sean Baker, not happy with us.  You guys are assholes.  I love you guys, but.  Oh, no.  The big but.  What did we do?  Michael Jackson was an icon and you guys should have some respect.  Atta boy, Sean.  I hope when you die, people make fun of you.  They will.  You don't think they won't?  Stop it.  Fucking icon.  First of all, they will.  I sore.  Stop it.  iPod.  I don't know what else. 
[02:37:30]  Smile and maybe tomorrow, you'll see the sun come shining through for you.  Smile.  Thought your mustache was stolen by a mass murderer.  Smile.  Smile, although you were almost kicked out of the country and called a communist. 
[02:38:00]  Smile, though you probably had sex with underage girls, too, on that boat.  He was a dirty boy.  Was he a naughty one, Chuck?  Womanizer.  You must keep on trying.  Smile.  What's the use of crying?  Right.  You'll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile. 
[02:38:30]  Who was the singer that did a duet on the Nat King Cole show?  Because she was white and she, like, touched his arm.  The whole country was like, that fucking white woman, that nigger touched a white woman.  Oh, and all these sponsors, like, canceled.  Really?  He had, like, the number one variety show in the world, and all these sponsors pulled 
[02:39:00]  out just because a black, like, hand brushed against the...  He touched her or she touched him?  He, like, put his arm around him when they were doing a duet, and the whole country just  fucking shut down, and he was off the air.  And he had, like, the number one show.  Holy shit.  Was it F.L. Merman?  No, it was a good...  I'm kidding.  It was a sexual component to it.  What was the other story where it was...  Let's see that.  Nat King Cole went swimming in a pool and they drained the pool?  Are you kidding?  There's another story.  I don't know if it's Nat King Cole, but it was another great black performer. 
[02:39:30]  See, now, that's a black guy that went through some shit.  Not like Reverend Al was saying Michael Jackson and all that stuff.  Nat King Cole, Jesus.  No, he came up in a tough time for sure in the 30s and 40s.  A lot tougher than the 90s.  Come on.  He didn't live too long.  He smoked five packs a day.  How did he die?  He had a fucking voice on him.  He did have a good voice.  What an instrument.  I love his Christmas songs.  And then Natalie Cole.  I thought he only did Christmas songs.  Amazing vocalist.  Natalie Cole.  Yeah.  Oh, was it Harry Belafonte? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, was it Belafonte that had the...  It was Dinah Shore?  Stephen...  Dinah Shore and Harry Belafonte?  Steve from Beacon?  Was it Harry Belafonte?  No.  We're getting to the bottom of it.  No, it was Nat King Cole and some other famous white singer, Peggy...  One of those...  What are you reading, Danny?  Lee or...  Yeah.  Is that right?  I'm still looking.  Oh, okay.  Someone's saying that Charlie Chaplin only wrote the music to the songs.  Yeah, he did write the lyrics.  The lyrics were actually penned by Lemmy from Motorhead. 
[02:40:30]  I recall my mom having a little story about when she was a kid.  Oh, no.  Nat King Cole, I hope.  She loved Nat King Cole.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  And one time, she was commenting on how she loved Nat King Cole when he was on TV, and  my grandfather heard that, and oh, boy, that didn't go over well.  I was a man who shoved us on my table, but it looks funny.  Oh, did Grandpa go off?  Oh, God.  Oh, the N-word was flying around the room. 
[02:41:00]  Do you mean Nat?  Yes, and it wasn't Nat.  Jeez.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, well, you know, it was a different time.  Yeah.  So they say back then.  What are you...  I just got info.  The pool story, Doris Day, but Doris Day wasn't...  Was Doris Day?  Doris Day was...  They drained the pool because Doris Day went in it?  What, her pubes get stuck in it?  Fuck.  Her tamp came out.  She had a plug.  Her plug came out and fucking clogged the pool. 
[02:41:30]  It was a black performer, right?  Doris Day was black.  Doris Day was black.  No, Doris Day was black.  No, Doris Day was black.  Anything but black.  Yes.  Everyone has a different black guy.  Oh.  Ray Charles, Harry Belafonte.  Is this a legend?  They're saying Harry Belafonte touched Petula Clark.  Right.  They drained the pool when Sammy Davis Jr. was in it in Vegas.  Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  Was it that way they found his eye in the skimmer?  That's how it made me. 
[02:42:00]  That might have gotten him a little weird.  Hey, Frank, my eye's in the drain.  It's just, like, flopping around in the skimmer.  They gotta take it out.  It smells like chlorine.  They're making it a racist thing, and it was just Sammy's eye.  They were just trying to get back.  Yeah.  You know.  It's like, ew.  But everyone's saying it's Sammy Davis Jr.  I mean, it is.  He went for a swim in the fucking dream.  That's a made-up story.  It takes days to drain a pool, isn't it?  God, I mean, come on now.  I gotta close down a casino pool.  All right, we gotta get to the bottom of the draining of the pool. 
[02:42:30]  It was like the Tangiers, I believe.  And the touching of the white woman.  Harry Belafonte, Otto.  Bullshit.  I'm talking about the 1950s.  Bullshit.  You're gonna challenge Iraq?  Yeah, the whole country.  I mean, I'm talking about-  Belafonte was in the 50s, wasn't he?  Harry Bel-  No, Harry Belafonte was, like, early 60s with that day-oh shit.  Yeah.  Nat King Cole had that fucking TV show.  It was canceled.  He did.  It was the Nat King Cole show.  Yeah, but I'm saying it was the number one show, but it was canceled because none of the sponsors would stay with him because he touched away. 
[02:43:00]  Look on YouTube, Dan.  Let's see if we can get the-  Now you just see it on old kinescopes and stuff.  Yeah.  Now that we're hearing that it was Ray Charles in the pool.  No.  It was in the movie Ray.  Who touched the white lady?  I don't know.  I'm all confused, Jimmy.  It was Jay-Z.  We can't even figure out-  At least we gave Corey Feldman a distraction today.  Dude, Corey Feldman.  No, he has to figure this shit out.  I'm not even gonna-  I'm not even gonna-  I'm not even gonna joke, man.  Corey Feldman's in pain.  I saw him.  He's hurting.  He's hurting.  Maybe it was George Hamilton, I'm thinking, I'm gonna need to drain the pool. 
[02:43:30]  He's got a nice tan-  This stupid tan because of all that spray-on shit.  But, you know, could you show Otto a picture of Corey Feldman, at least?  Smile.  It's in the paper.  Oh, anyway, Jermaine Jackson sang Smile Just Like Nat King Cole did.  You heard Nat King Cole.  Did he sing good?  Oh, it was terrific, Jimmy.  Smile.  Yeah.  Though your heart is aching.  Smile.  With these guys. 
[02:44:00]  Breaking.  When.  Dry mouth.  He's trying to sound like Michael.  In the sky, you'll get by.  That's better sounds in a paid toilet.  Speaking of which, Iraq walked in.  Stinks.  Hello.  Stinks.  I'm sorry, Iraq.  I don't like your shrugged crack mouth, Lenny and squigging entrance.  I don't like fucking Iraq's slanted baboon nipples.  Iraq has fucking slanted baboon nipples, and I'm fucking tired of it. 
[02:44:30]  I'm tired of those fucking orangutan tits flopping all over this fucking studio.  Get out of here.  My dick is hard.  Allen in Nebraska was Dorothy Dandridge with the pool thing.  Dorothy Dandridge?  I bet.  I was she.  We got the answer to the touching of the girl.  Oh, my God.  In 1968, Belafonte appeared on a Petula Clark primetime TV special on NBC.  In the middle of a song, Clark smiled and briefly touched Belafonte's arm, which made the show's sponsor, Plymouth Motors, nervous. 
[02:45:00]  Plymouth wanted to cut out the segment, but Clark, who had ownership of the special, told NBC that the performance would be shown intact or she would not allow the special to be aired at all.  American newspapers published articles reporting the controversy, and when the special aired, it grabbed high viewing figures.  Yeah, but look up Nat King Cole's ratings when the show went off the air.  He was, like, the highest-rated show.  It's a different story completely.  It's ten years later.  I'm sure it could happen a couple of times.  Yeah.  Watch it be different, and then Nat King Cole threw her down on the ground and straddled her face and humped it and yelled, smell it, white bitch. 
[02:45:30]  And they canceled the show.  Totally just the boss.  Yeah.  Like, it was something really raw.  Like, he was high.  He had coke on his upper lip.  Grabbed her head.  She was trying to sing a song.  He face-raped me.  Yeah.  He shoved her face right into his crotch.  Yeah.  She screamed.  While it was live TV, no one could believe what he was doing.  Yeah.  He had a ciggy hanging out of his mouth.  Smell my balls, white bitch. 
[02:46:00]  And they were worried the sponsors were going to get nervous.  Yes.  They got nervous?  Yeah.  The site, haha.com, has added your Google Bomb keyword to its permanent website title.  Oh, nice.  God damn, that's funny, man.  Dorothy Dandridge.  Allen in Nebraska.  Yeah.  Hi, Allen.  What's up?  Hey.  So what do you know about this Dorothy Dandridge?  I just watched a documentary about her life and the show down there where she had just stuck 
[02:46:30]  her toe in the pool and they had drained the pool and that's about it.  Sounds like nonsense.  Yeah.  The fucking Grand Wizard wouldn't drain his pool because someone put their toe in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a lot of work.  Now we're hearing Nat King, Cole, and Dinah Shore on Nat's variety show.  Yeah, he had his variety show.  Yeah.  It was a very big show.  That's what I'm talking about.  Otto's hanging tough here. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  I still say it's Nat King, Cole.  I've read books.  Yeah.  I love reading about those people.  Let's see.  In fact, the Cole program was routinely beaten by the competition at ABC, which was then riding  high with its travel and Western shows.  His show was canceled due to a lack of national sponsorship.  Yeah.  Did you mix up two stories, Otto?  No.  Incidentally?  No.  No, I didn't.  Otto, come clean.  I didn't mix up two fucking stories.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Are you sure? 
[02:47:30]  This whole story is getting twisted now.  It turns out it was fucking HervÃ© Villachez on the Merv Griffin show.  He was singing, being short eats ass, and they had to beep him out.  I just can't get over the night making, Cole, just forcing himself on a woman on my TV.  He was dying in shore.  He held her head, and he humped her, and with that back that ass up, bitch, dance, cigarette,  no one could believe he was doing it.  Her singing was muffled in his trousered balls.  Holy shit. 
[02:48:00]  Philip Morris is just on the phone.  Get me off of this program.  Yes.  He's yelling, smell my balls, white bitch.  There's no way to spin this.  Oh, my God.  Garba Baby Food's pulling out.  Otto, do you have something to tell us?  About what?  About not having the right story.  Fuck, man.  I'm telling you.  It was a lot of hatred.  There's plenty of hatred to go around with Belafonte and that thing called.  I don't know.  I think that fucking, I think Bogart actually held on to his story better at the end of the  Cane Mutiny.  You're holding on to it right now.  I got the real pool story here, though. 
[02:48:30]  It was Bushwood Country Club drained their pool after a Snickers bar was found in it.  After Tommy Lee threw a party.  Why don't we take a break?  There's Harry Belafonte.  We got Harry Belafonte.  Let's see if he grabs her arm.  Watch him grab her arm aggressively.  Is this the clip?  What the fuck is that?  Who's dancing?  Sammy K.  Danny K.  Or Danny K.  Sammy K. 
[02:49:00]  Sammy K.  I saw the white guy and the white guy.  Put them together.  It's Danny K.  My mother went to the same high school as him.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Worst story ever alert.  Yeah.  That's brutal.  He was just trying to share with us, Jimmy.  He was just sharing.  He was just sharing.  It's like in his side. 
[02:49:30]  He just hammered.  He was just sharing with us.  A nice little thing.  Damn.  Jimmy.  Holy shit.  All right.  Enough of fucking Harry Belafonte.  I want to see if he grabs her.  He's on stage by himself.  He ain't grabbing anyone.  He ain't grabbing nothing.  Maybe Otto's right then.  I don't see him grabbing anybody.  Right.  It's Harry.  Exactly.  Why don't we take a break?  When we get back, we got Michael Jackson Memorial, Martin Luther King III.  We talked about this earlier.  We got the audio, Anthony. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  I'm just still laughing at the worst story ever alert.  Harry Belafonte.  It was cool.  My grandmother bumped into his driver once in a pathway.  Are you saying Otto's a liar?  No.  I believe Otto actually completely.  Oh, yeah.  Also, we have a Michael Jackson tribute song.  Uh-oh.  It's called Better on the Other Side.  The game featuring Chris Brown, Diddy, Polo.  No way.  Didon, Mario. 
[02:50:30]  This is real.  Winans, Usher, Boyz II Men.  Michael Jackson tribute song on the way.  Ugh.  They always, we love the tribute.  What fucking loop do they steal?  Who doesn't love the tribute song?  What do they steal?  What sample?  We're going to find out next, my friend.  And then Ron Artest, Michael Michael.  A song called Michael Michael.  P. Diddy always comes to the table when someone dies to fucking make a little profit, so.  Yep.  And Otto, where are you going to be?  Zanies?  Nashville.  Nice, right?  That's a good club, the Zanies in Nashville. 
[02:51:00]  I've done that before.  Yeah, I'm doing that.  Yeah, I'm definitely going there.  I got this thing with Valby I'm doing.  Me and Valby are doing a bunch of shows.  Oh, wow.  Where?  I was, hold on.  We're doing this casino in New Hampshire.  No, no.  I was in Rochester.  You're doing Rochester, too, I heard.  We're doing Westbury.  Yeah.  That is a fucking great show.  Hold on, let me see.  Yeah.  Otto's doing Nashville Comedy Club, and it's one show each night, July 17th and 18th.  Thank you.  That's a 10 o'clock show, as Otto always does, a late show.  Yeah.  And August 1st, it's one show, 8 o'clock. 
[02:51:30]  This is Blumenreich's room, the Hampton Beach Casino.  That's a big room.  It's called Three Dummies and a Puppet.  Nice.  It's with Valby and Paul Parsons.  Nice.  Is it really called this?  Yes.  Yeah.  But I got to say, it's casinoballroom.com.  Manhattan Beach Casino, everybody up in Boston knows that place.  You play there?  No, no, but I'm very familiar with it.  It's a great, that's a great show to see right there.  It's not an actual casino, it's just called Casino Ball.  I actually didn't know that.  Yeah.  It's a little confusing with the plugs.  If you're Otto and George fan like we are, go to OttoandGeorge.com for all the dates, 
[02:52:00]  right?  Your dates are there?  Yeah.  To purchase Three Dummies and a Puppet, laugh.com also sells that.  All right, there you go.  What a great fucking show.  You and Valby is a perfect, he's like the only guy that can follow you.  I can't go, I would never go on after fucking Otto anywhere.  Really?  No!  I was going to ask if I could open for you the next time you play at the Borgata.  Nope.  I'll fuck, I'll spit in your face.  Really?  No!  Why?  Not following, it's a respect thing.  I would never, I would go on after Otto, we were both on a stage, the comedy slot.  Yeah.  And we had to do 15 minutes each, and it was so and so, Otto, me, a bunch of comedians, 
[02:52:30]  then I'll go on after anybody.  But in a headline situation, where Otto's going, fuck you, never.  Oh, thanks.  But he wants the big gig.  Good for Otto, let him fucking close.  He wants the big gig.  No, not, when he kills, it really is, when he's hammering an audience, it's un-fucking-fallible.  And I mean that, it's fucking, it's just, it's like I'm watching a machine work.  Yeah.  Nice.  You're a dummy if you want after that.  Valby can do it because of the music, and he's so dirty, but fuck that. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Never.  We're going to see how Corey Feldman's doing next, so stay right there.  Hoping Anthony's stuff.  Hanging with Otto and George today.  Otto.  Ottoandgeorge.com.  Zany's Comedy Club, July 17th and 18th.  Thank you.  There you go.  One of the funniest fucking comics ever.  Loved him on the virus shows.  I miss those shows.  We'll bring it back.  We should bring it back.  The economy sucks right now. 
[02:53:30]  Do a big one.  We're going to go big.  Yeah.  We'll go big for you, Otto.  Just for you.  It was awesome.  What do you guys want to do?  You got Martin Luther King III.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We didn't really like his shit at the moment, right?  He's very lackluster.  It doesn't have that spark.  Was it like Sharpton, or was it just not a particularly good speaker?  It just was boring.  It was a couple dullards.  No passion to the speech.  It just wasn't there. 
[02:54:00]  Well, after having a father like that who did what his father did, it's going to be hard  to muster it up just for this fucking dopey singer.  Yeah.  But he's known to be kind of a lackluster speaker.  I love that word.  Lackluster.  It lacks luster.  My father once said that in life, one must discover what their calling is, and when they  do, they must do their jobs so well that the living, the dead, or the unborn could do them 
[02:54:30]  no better, he constantly challenged us to become our best by stating that if you cannot  be a pine on the top of the hill, why, just be a shrub in the valley, but be the best little  shrub on the side of the road.  Be a bush if you cannot be a tree.  If you cannot be the highway, just be a trail.  If you cannot be the sun, just be a star, for it isn't by size that you win or you fail.  So, you've got to be the best of what you are. 
[02:55:00]  This house show am crazy.  Jesus.  So, basically.  Boogity, boogity.  So, basically, his father said, just exist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just keep breathing.  You know what it is?  That's pretty impressive.  And imagine.  He saw what is hard.  He is a bush.  What the fuck?  Imagine just having to talk about your father for your entire life.  That's all he does is, like, get up and say.  That's Martin Luther King's son. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And just my father once said, and my father said, and my father.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  It would be like, with me, it's like, my father said, Anthony, get me a beer.  Yeah.  My father once said, Anthony, I'm pretty hammered.  This might be a rough drive home.  Like, imagine your whole life, though, is just talking about your dad.  My father once said to me, Jimmy, you're supposed to do that with girls.  And you've got to make it almost sound charming. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, God.  My father once said to me, I recall us driving in a pickup truck.  Yeah.  On the Ortega Highway, which was a windy road.  And I looked at my father and said, Dad, wake up.  We are ready to plummet.  You drunk.  To our deaths.  My father once said to me, I'm a great civil rights leader.  Can you stop eating?  Because you look fat.  He really is a fatty.  What an oinker. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  The, uh, what's probably annoying, though, is having everybody talk to you about your  father.  Yeah.  Your father meant so much.  I know.  Like, the movement.  JFK Jr. had to stop flying commercial airlines because, and we all saw how that worked out.  Well, you know, but it was the fog.  But because people, people mean well, but it was all memories of his father and how it,  and it's like, you know, people are being, I would have said that to him.  I know, you know, your dad was a very important man.  But so after a while, you just want to read the paper and go, shut up.  Right.  Enough about him. 
[02:57:00]  My dick itches.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Uh, we got an astronomer checking in.  What?  If you can't be the sun, be a star.  Isn't the sun a star?  He didn't actually say that, did he?  All right.  And if you can't be a star, be a supernova.  Well, be a black hole.  Or at least, uh, uh, uh, I've ran out of references.  Finally, Martin Luther King Jr. said that in life, if your father-  This whole gig is-  Yeah.  Say what his father said.  And then he said, he calls him Martin Luther King Jr.  Right. 
[02:57:30]  How about my dad?  Yeah.  My daddy.  Papa.  Papa.  Finally, Martin Luther King Jr. said that in life, if it falls ever your lot to be a street  sweeper, you must sweep streets so well.  In fact, you must sweep streets like Beethoven composed music.  Yeah, that's the same thing.  Sweep streets, he said, like Shakespeare wrote poetry.  Yeah, that's the same thing.  Sweep streets like Raphael painted pictures.  Sweep streets so well that all the hosts of the heavens and earth would have to pause 
[02:58:00]  and say, he'll live-  But in the end, you're still a street sweeper.  World needs ditch tickets too, you know.  Oh, you can glorify the hell out of it all you want, but you're still a street sweeper.  How about things-  And we understand your father was, look, you know, a great man, but how about things you  say?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't just have to quote your dad.  How about you?  Who's that chick with him, by the way?  Wow.  Martin Luther King III did well.  Well, he's-  He's fat.  He looks weird.  He's kind of like Al Roker-ish with a mustache. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And he is fucking married to a smoking hot chick.  Yeah.  Of course.  My father said, check that balcony.  I think I see something.  Yeah.  Get the hottest pussy you can get.  Yeah.  Right.  My father taught me how to get pussy.  Sweep-  Ah, po-ha.  ...and say, here lived a great street sweeper that did his job well.  On June 25th, because he was the best, I believe heaven and earth did pause indeed to 
[02:59:00]  say of Michael Joseph Jackson, here lived a great entertainer who did his job well.  Wow.  Is he a terrible speaker?  I don't think the earth paused.  No.  No.  It didn't.  It actually continued in the exact same speed it has.  He doesn't have that same quivering, dramatic-  No, no.  There's no passion in that voice.  And if-  You know something about earth.  If it paused, wouldn't we all like either fall off or feel very nauseous? 
[02:59:30]  Oh my God, it would be crazy.  We'd feel nauseous, right?  I think if the earth paused, we would all be squished, because there would be no centrifugal force.  I've been to the mountaintop.  There's a Wendy's up there.  God, that's one of the worst speeches I've ever heard.  Yeah.  Yeah, horrible.  Yeah.  He was boring.  Well, let's move into the tribute song.  We love the tribute song.  The old listeners know that.  We got Ron Artest. 
[03:00:00]  Michael, Michael.  Michael, you my-  The word that gets white people in trouble.  All right.  Or we go with Better on the Other Side, featuring the game, Chris Brown, Diddy, Usher, Boyz II Men.  Let's hear this clusterfuck.  All right.  You know this is just going to suck a big, fat one.  Another opportunist, P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  Remember the first time I seen you moonwalk?  Oh, shit. 
[03:00:30]  Bring it down low.  Jesus.  Maudelin.  But you know what I'm about.  I remember the first time I saw you moonwalk.  I said, what the fuck he doing?  How do you do that?  Who is that white lady?  Is that a conveyor belt?  Let's play a little game called, how many seconds until it goes like, you know-  What?  Deuce chill?  Goes hip hop.  Oh.  Before it goes-  Where it kicks in.  Anybody want to play?  Yeah.  Money on the table, Adam?  What do you got?  What do you got on here?  He's going to talk-  What do you mean by hip hop?  I'm going 30 seconds in before it really kicks in. 
[03:01:00]  No, they're going all soft with the piano, but I mean, these guys have to, you know-  Sing?  He's going to sing?  Where do they hip it up?  Oh.  Then it starts-  A little hip to the hop to the hippity.  The beat will come in.  Oh, okay.  It'll go from piano until the beat kicking in, and then they'll start, like, rapping.  Yeah.  But I'll say 15 seconds.  We're only going five today.  No, I have fiver.  Fiver?  I'm going to go 37 seconds.  I'm saying 15 seconds.  Otto?  You're out to bet.  I can bet. 
[03:01:30]  37.  I would say a minute.  60 seconds.  It's now.  It's a long time.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  So it gets hip hop.  I'm going to say 40 seconds.  I think you're going to say three minutes and 20 seconds.  I'm way underbid.  I don't know.  Let's see.  How long did you say it?  I said 15 seconds.  I gave it 40.  Here we go.  I think it's going to kick in quick.  Remember the first time I seen you more?  Oh, fuck. 
[03:02:00]  It's a wrinkle, a commercial.  Acrobatics.  I lose.  And it's officially out.  You made the world dance.  You made the music of your life.  That's it.  Fuck.  God damn it.  Is that textbook shit?  How, uh...  30?  How long was that?  What kind of rules are we playing?  Price is right.  That's not necessarily hip hop, by the way.  Price is right rules.  That's not hip hop.  Can't be over.  Can't be over?  That's not hip hop. 
[03:02:30]  That was like...  That fucking could be club music.  You said when it gets hip hop.  When the song just pumps up.  Yeah, when it kicks in.  When it kicks in.  I think that's obvious it kicked in there, no?  Yeah, right when the drum hits.  Oh, shit.  Do we have it upset?  Let's see.  That's hip hop.  Then...  Nah, but that could just be like, uh...  I win?  Fucking Anthony.  What is it at?  23 seconds.  Oh, 23 seconds.  I was the next at 37.  Motherfucker.  You got five out of my 20 best.  I should have said 16. 
[03:03:00]  I didn't gamble.  Cop killer.  That's all right.  Do we need to hear the rest of this?  Yeah.  Look up in the sky and I wonder why.  Why?  Why you had to go, go.  And I was better on the other side.  Oh, what a grace.  You were chosen from the star.  I'm gonna cry.  He didn't have to go.  Michael Jackson chose to go.  Yeah.  It didn't come out.  It's pretty much Michael Jackson committed suicide.  Where were these guys, by the way?  Huh?  Where were these guys when he was alive?  Hmm.  Where were they yesterday?  Were they hanging with him? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, shit.  Controversy.  You know something?  Give me my five bucks back.  That might be where it kicks in.  That's where it gets hip hop, which was the question.  I said hip hop.  That is the question.  Tell me when. 
[03:04:00]  All right, children.  Whenever we get you back.  DJ.  Oh, fair.  There.  DJ, right there.  No, no, no.  No.  A little later.  I'm a miss.  We're all right.  Right there.  Yeah, that.  Yeah.  That first big hit.  Pass the five over to Jimmy.  Well, thank you.  That's mine.  That's my five.  Fuck you.  I won that five.  Fuck you.  I just gave mine to Jimmy.  Now you owe Jimmy a $5 bill.  That was my five. 
[03:04:30]  How is it yours?  I won a bet, but then I had to pay Jimmy.  What the fuck?  How many seconds?  Dude, you used to make fucking just rain money.  I know.  What happened to you?  Thank you.  Looks like someone's got a fuckload of money.  Someone's got a brand new Abe to play with.  Aw.  Aw.  Who's Michael Jackson?  You're Michael Jackson.  I'm Michael Jackson.  We all Michael Jackson.  Really?  Ow.  What I'm asking is everybody bow their head for a legend. 
[03:05:00]  Don't breathe for a second.  Now let the air out.  Ride a hand of somebody you care about.  So you can hear my message.  My confession.  Somebody tell Usher.  I seen a moonwalk.  I guess the young thriller touched him.  Like he touched me.  Like he touched you.  So carrying this legacy is something I must do.  And I trust you.  Lighting candles.  Concrete vigils.  Me and my brother's Mr. Jackson 5 in our living room.  First thing I did when I heard was called Puff.  Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beat between. 
[03:05:30]  Anyone else get tired listening to this type of music?  I swear to you.  It's just.  You're trying to follow along.  Repetitive.  Yeah.  We're all Michael Jackson.  It's like watching a subtitled movie.  We're not.  It's subtitled.  It's not for us is what it is.  It's exhausting.  It's just not for us.  It's not awful.  I mean, you know.  It's what it is.  It's fucking generic. 
[03:06:00]  Shit.  People are saying you got to play a part of the Ron Artest, Michael, Michael, Michael,  you my.  You my nigga.  Is it with an A?  Is that what it is?  It's with the A.  So we're all right.  Yeah, yo.  Unless they change that rule.  I'm feeling it.  I don't think we get in trouble for saying the name of a song.  I hear this is horrendous.  Let's give a listen.  What's going on with Jimmy's Google bomb?  I searched Corey Feltman is hurting 200 times.  Where is everyone else?  I'm with you.  He is. 
[03:06:30]  He's hurting.  We're probably spelling Corey and Feltman wrong.  Yo, yo.  Yo.  Yo.  What's the real shit?  Michael, Michael, you my nigga.  What a compliment.  Jesus Christ.  Come on.  Yeah, but they're outraged when we use that word.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know, you guys dead.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Stupid double standard.  I don't know that ruling.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  You know, ruling on that.  You find that you say whatever.  Yeah, we ruined the word.  Okay.  Yeah.  I know a thug will cry for you, my dude.  Ain't no horn beat singer really ever make me cry.  Make me want to meet you, touch your hand.  You know?  Michael, Michael, Michael, you my nigga.  Only don't tell a lie.  Nigga, you know that you're missing.  Know that you're missing.  Yeah, yeah.  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike. 
[03:07:30]  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike.  Michael, Michael, Michael, you my nigga.  Only don't tell a lie.  Nigga, you know that you're missing.  This is horrendous.  That is shit.  What happened?  The wheels came off immediately.  You just looked at me.  I'm offended.  It could be melodic, but it's just like, what are you doing?  That is really bad.  Listen to how it starts.  It could be, but it just gets all fucking jumbled. 
[03:08:00]  It's like when you think you have control of a video game and then everything's coming  on too fast.  You're like, oh, fuck.  Michael, Michael, Michael, where's a wigger?  Listen to it again.  It just gets so fucking bizarre very quickly.  Michael, you my nigga.  Hold me, don't tell a lie.  Nigga, you know that you're missing.  Know that you're missing.  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike.  Yo, I understand controversy. 
[03:08:30]  I understand who's trying to hurt me.  He said I ain't worthy.  He said you ain't worthy.  I'm glad you wasn't growing up with Mike.  No way to good die early.  Early.  Silence for Mike.  Silence for Mike.  Silence for Mike.  Silence for Mike.  This is horrendous.  But by the way, this sounds like it was recorded in fucking eight different studios and they  couldn't get the speed correctly.  I'm going in different directions to the speed.  I don't think you should be singing that he used to show you love. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Hmm.  And the other song, I think, had the lyric, he touched me as a kid.  Yeah.  That might be a little rough, too.  Some allegations that a lot of people aren't over with.  Over, yes.  No, you didn't know me, but you showed me live.  I hailed the world with your words.  Time is priceless. 
[03:09:30]  I'm going to get on every line so I can buy a CD in the stores.  I hope the kids is doing well.  If they fuck anybody hating, they can go to hell.  Whoa.  Lyrically, well done lyrically.  I didn't see that coming.  Well in hell.  The fucking wheels are falling off and now he's losing his voice.  This could be the best train wreck ever.  Ah, they can go to hell.  I don't go to Sunoco.  I go to Shell.  This is like rapping from 1985.  Yeah.  It's so cold in the day.  Hello, Cole Porter. 
[03:10:00]  We don't need you now.  Thanks.  Listen to him lose his voice.  The time is priceless.  I'm going to get on every line so I can buy a CD in the stores.  I hope the kids is doing well.  If they fuck anybody hating, they can go to hell.  I swear.  I swear.  I swear.  You know, if my nigga back, all his music was straight crack.  Did it like that.  MJ, MJ.  You and my friends.  I know you in heaven.  I hope to see you next year.  Yeah.  We hope you do too. 
[03:10:30]  Next year.  You hope to see him next year?  That's what?  What?  You got a terminal illness?  What the fuck?  What's going on with the guy?  What the fuck does that mean?  It's like old age for this guy with all the lead flying around his head probably in the hood.  I'm sure he wouldn't approve of this song. 
[03:11:00]  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Mike.  Yo.  Mike.  Stop.  Mike.  Mike.  Stop.  Mike.  Everybody.  Listen to the heartbeat of Mike.  It's still living in my body.  He's baby.  And he's living in you.  What would you do if it wasn't for my tune?  And your tune, he's our tune.  He's a real tight tune.  Phil Moses is not a good tune. 
[03:11:30]  I don't even know what he's saying now.  He's our dude.  He's my dude.  He was no one's dude.  He was a weird guy with fucking cheap animation eyes.  He was a loner.  He was a creep.  Big bugged out eyes.  Horrible plastic surgery.  I like the hook though.  Like, like, like.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  You got a chin like Kirk Douglas.  Somebody wrote that.  I thought that was pretty funny.  They held up their iPod with the Shazam app, and it came back utter shit.  Oh. 
[03:12:00]  Did you know?  Most official.  He inspired guys like Jamie Foxx and Usher too.  Since they keeping you alive, I'm a moonwalk too.  To the moon over the earth and sand dunes too.  Play pretty young thing when I'm chilling with my boo in the club.  And even though I'm always strapped, I'm putting down my Mac with my Jackie so wavy.  You're my nigga.  You're my nigga.  Homie, don't tell a lie.  Yeah, you know that you miss him.  You know that you miss him. 
[03:12:30]  This is awful.  I cried for Mike.  I cried for Mike.  I cried for Mike.  I cried for Mike.  This is he.  He's my nigga.  Yeah.  Homie, don't tell a lie.  Homie, don't tell a lie.  The homie.  Don't lie.  I cry for Mike.  Hey.  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike.  I cry for Mike.  Thanks.  How come you didn't mention Nipsey Russell?  Oh, it's the Tin Man.  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  You're the man.  Yeah.  Mike, Mike, Mike's a baby sticker. 
[03:13:00]  What else can I say?  It's like big tits.  Oh, what?  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, I'm a getter.  Jesus.  All right, we get it.  Exactly.  He spent millions of dollars to forget he was black,  and they're calling him a nigger in a fucking tribute song.  Terrible.  It's not even, like, casually thrown into the song. 
[03:13:30]  He gives it more times than My Drive Home.  They mean Michael Richards, actually, that was certain, too.  Jim in Philly writes, Jesus, you fuckers are funny.  I saw a brother selling every Michael Jackson CD on one disc yesterday.  No better way to honor an icon than copyright infringement.  Fuck, is that funny?  That was a horrible tribute song.  Well, you want to go deeper with the horribleness? 
[03:14:00]  What, you got another?  As long as we don't poke fun.  That was bad.  It's catchy.  The tempo of that is catchy.  There's something about it.  It could have been really good.  I think I might be a little stuck in the head just on the chorus.  We got Heather, who liked the song.  Heather Heights, maybe?  Yes, it is Heather Heights.  How are you?  How are you, Heather Heights?  Hello.  Hi, Otto.  Hi, Heather.  I know you.  Are you going to play her comedy club?  I hear she's got a little joint.  You're still doing that comedy club thing?  Yes, I am.  He's going to be there sometime in the fall. 
[03:14:30]  Where is it?  Comedy.  It's in Plainview in Long Island at the Four Point Sheridan.  What's the name of the club?  It's called Joker's Wild.  All right.  There you go.  Look for Joker's Wild for some nice comedy.  By the way, if you tell me on the sign, exactly, if you tell me on the sign there's anything  like with little tasseled balls hanging or like a Joker hat, I'll set the fucking stage  on fire.  Well, we did that just for you.  Did you like a Joker hat? 
[03:15:00]  Yes.  We have a little, we have a Joker with a little Joker hat on our banner.  Does it look like a playing card?  It does.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got that all figured out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should say, if you want to show Joker's Wild, you should show Pryor fucking punching  Jennifer Lee in the face.  I didn't name the club.  My fiance named the club.  All right.  Nice.  Passing the buck.  I love it.  I like that too.  Heather, you like that song?  I love that song.  I'm going to be walking around singing that really loudly all day long. 
[03:15:30]  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  It's catchy, but it just.  Isn't it amazing how just a quick word change, if you changed my to uh, it would be totally  different meaning.  Yeah.  But true.  My word.  What, are we keeping you awake, Big A?  Jesus.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, Big A's out there.  I'm sorry.  Whoa, whoa.  We're away.  He's a tie.  Hey, Kenny, can you take that, uh, give that to Kenny.  Interrupting your fucking nap time, huh?  Thank you, Big A.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  I was watching a, uh.  You seem snoozing out there.  He's a mid-morning bacon nap.  I was watching that, uh, Twilight Zone marathon, and George sitting in that chair reminds me  of the one, because I saw the one with the dummy.  Oh, Cliff Robertson?  Yeah, Cliff Robertson in it.  That was a good one, man.  Yeah.  That was really scary.  Fucking real scary.  That was scary.  He gets the other dummy and starts using that, and then winds up ripping that one apart.  That sick laugh that the puppet has at the end?  Oh, yeah.  That was a great one.  That was very disturbing.  Heather, anything else?  You just liked the song, huh?  I love the song, yeah.  Yeah, and I want to say hi to Otto. 
[03:16:30]  Hi, Heather.  Mom said hi.  How's married life treating you?  Not married yet.  Oh, you're not married yet.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  James' life is good, though.  Oh, okay.  Trouble in paradise.  Oh, shit.  Somebody got caught with a man of color, didn't she?  Oh, God.  Still free.  Heather, Heather, Heather, he's a, what?  Ah, yeah, that's the one.  Did you say Big A was there?  Yeah, he's outside.  Yeah, he's outside.  We don't let him in here.  He's soiling a chair.  Yeah.  It's like everybody that I used to come to see is there today.  Hmm.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[03:17:00]  You will always be in our hearts 
[03:17:30]  You will always be in our hearts  That's just awful.  Are we done with this one?  Good audio quality.  You can dance, not do the things that only you can. 
[03:18:00]  You're world of a kind.  Porto San Records.  You're in the love with the music.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow makes me laugh.  Oh, it's atrocious.  We'll only give these guys a minute.  We'll try this one by L-I-R-A or L-I-L-R-A. 
[03:18:30]  Something like that.  S-H-I-T.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Got a little white boy music.  Early.  Jimmy, your favorite person is what we got.  It took me a minute to write this song.  Since you're not here, inspiration's gone.  But I know it won't be long.  This is upsettingly bad.  When the mom comes without you, I need something. 
[03:19:00]  I need something.  That clap sound.  I need something.  I need something.  Without you.  How about a shotgun?  Yeah.  All right.  We get it.  You need something without you.  Well, B-Dub in Kansas City writes that we should have our own contest, have listeners  come up with their own Michael Jackson tribute song. 
[03:19:30]  Could be a problem.  Why?  No.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We'll just throw it out there.  See what they come up with.  And finally, this one.  I Need You, it's called.  Right. 
[03:20:00]  Point.  I write the songs that make you and I must make a path.  Who's this, Fez?  We must bring salvation back.  Just call my name.  And I'll be there. 
[03:20:30]  Hey, musically untalented person.  I'll reach out my hand to you.  Oh.  That stole Charlie Cheswick's record.  Yeah.  I don't want your larynx or your larynx.  I want my larynx.  Actually, he sings like Bibbett after he fucking, after Nurse Ratched fucking threatened  a snitch.  Oh, that is bad. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, Charlie Cheswick's record.  Cheswick.  Oh, I love when he's trying to fucking.  What a great reference.  I love when he's trying to make Mr. Harding feel better.  Sometimes.  Please.  Please.  Stay off my side.  Chesie, stay off my side.  Chesie.  Sometimes they gang up on me.  Please.  Yeah.  He just wants to, wants to help so badly.  One flow.  But I only wanted to help.  Gotta watch that movie again.  It's fucking, I, I, that's amazing.  I can't decide.  I fluctuate between my, the greatest movie.  It's like, I will in one moment say Cuckoo's Nest and then I'll go, God damn it, The Godfather's 
[03:21:30]  a work of art.  Yeah.  Or Raging Bull is a work of art.  But fucking Cuckoo's Nest.  Goodfellas, I don't put, Cuckoo's Nest makes me cry when I watch it.  Like, it's a tragic, I, every, it, no movie gets the emotion out of me that that does.  Every time, I'm like, the fucking window's open, leave, go.  Just go, leave.  When the chief throws the sink through the window, it's like chills, right?  Yeah, it's amazing.  Even The Godfather and Raging Bull, they don't bring that as great as they were. 
[03:22:00]  They don't hit you there.  That's fucking an amazing movie.  Every performance, too, is just great.  How irresponsible.  The window was open.  Just go.  Just go.  You and Chief can go to Canada.  You can fuck rotten, curly-haired candy.  All right.  Just go.  Stupid Billy is not ready.  I don't care if it doesn't make for a good movie.  Just go.  Get out.  Just leave.  Mac?  Mac?  You fucking, oh, don't, don't pass out.  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. Turkle, that fucking, he passed out.  He's a terrible night washman.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  He was hard.  He was not good.  Turkle.  Ain't nobody jerking off, motherfucker.  What the fuck are you doing?  I'm in here hiding with your ass.  God, was he great.  Fucking scatting.  At least he got to give him an axe in the chest in The Shining.  Yeah.  That's true.  Ain't nobody jerking off, motherfucker.  I love it.  He goes, my job, you fucking it up.  Yeah.  So frustrated.  Take that big no talking, motherfucker.  He was great in Cuckoo's Nest.  Yeah, it was good.  God damn, was that a great scene.  You're right.  Dirty, corrupt night porter.  I know.  He put frogs in my bra. 
[03:23:00]  Very interesting.  Big A, get your ass in here.  Did Sharon Osborne not call you yet?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm on my knees, brother.  Do we have to talk to her today?  Yes.  All right.  If she calls.  All right.  Here comes a big A.  A big A.  Take a seat there, big A.  Hello, Andrew.  Oh, Ron and Fez are on vacation, so you decide to come and see the guys that made you famous 
[03:23:30]  in the first place.  He doesn't care about us at all anymore.  That's really nice.  That's really nice.  That's really nice.  That's really nice.  That's really nice.  That's real nice of you, big A.  That's real nice of you, big A.  That's real nice of you, big A.  You need some air time, so he comes in.  I might as well go see the guys that put me on the map.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  Real nice of you.  I remember.  Yeah.  We remember too, big A.  Hi, Andrew.  Now it's a big A.  Hey, big A.  In honor of Michael Jackson dying, would you do us the pleasure of singing Don't Stop  Till You Get Enough, if we got you the words? 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Can we get the words to Don't Stop Till You Get Enough?  What have you been up to, Andrew?  A little karaoke action.  Nothing much.  You run a marathon?  It's working.  Jesus.  It was 15 feet.  Still working?  Yeah.  Same place, right?  Still driving?  Same car?  Yep.  Oh, different cars, but...  Do you work as a delivery driver where you just stop and pick people up randomly?  No, actually, we call the base and the calls spatched out. 
[03:24:30]  Okay.  If you, like, drop somebody at the airport, you're not allowed to pick somebody up, like,  gypsy.  No, didn't you see DC Cab, I don't know?  They did.  Oh, that'll get him in big trouble.  That's bad.  That'll get him into some big trouble.  Irene Cara?  Oh, God.  We're getting the words for you there.  All right.  Yeah.  A big A.  A big A.  A big A.  You look like you need a little shampoo there, big A. What happened?  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  His hair looks a little greasy today. 
[03:25:00]  What?  What's wrong?  What are you talking about, dude?  I'm just saying, look.  Jesus, man.  He's got, like, a Hitler sweep going.  He's got, like, that Adolf.  I thought you would enjoy a little Hitler sweep.  Angry Adolf.  He looks fine.  What?  Is there something going on?  Big A?  Maybe he put some gel in it, right?  Did you put gel in your hair?  A little bit, yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Hey, fuck me for talking.  He didn't have moose.  Don't make me think what I did over here.  He didn't have moose.  He had to cut the throat of a prostitute.  Use her blood to dab his hair gingerly back. 
[03:25:30]  Any Michael Jackson memories?  Were you sad when you heard?  Where do you stand on this, Big A?  Actually, when I heard, you know, me and a friend of mine didn't believe it.  You know, actually.  I don't believe you have a friend.  Yeah, exactly.  Who was this friend?  This imaginary friend.  George Glass?  Who was this friend? 
[03:26:00]  He's a dispatcher over at my cab company.  Okay, where were you, old guy?  Exactly.  You're all losers.  We didn't believe it.  We had to look under Regan's sweater.  Your wife's peach cobbler gives me the trots.  So, now, what about, he called it peach swamp.  It was a gem, that fucking show.  So, Andrew, what, uh, yeah, your wife's peach trying to slap us. 
[03:26:30]  All right, so, Andrew, what were you in the dispatcher doing when you heard this tragic news?  Um, we were just in the office.  Blowing each other?  I was waiting for a call, and we were just talking BS, as always.  Language.  Hmm.  Um, so then you got the news.  What you didn't believe, where'd you hear the news from?  Actually, another driver, um, called in, um, to the dispatcher, and, and told us the news. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  So, you were saddened.  Did he cry?  No, I didn't.  Ow.  All right.  Ow.  You want to sing Don't Stop Till You Get Enough?  Or, or, or want to be starting something could be good, too.  Oh.  Want to be starting something.  I mean, I can find out what that word is.  What's this?  Oh, good.  It's a very varied group of lyrics.  Oh.  How many times did he fucking say it? 
[03:27:30]  Hmm.  Keep on.  What about that?  Oh, really?  Is that what he said?  Where?  Eh, I have no idea.  All right.  Amazing.  Second verse.  Same as the first.  Oh.  You going to sit and do this?  Yeah.  Big A's putting on his, uh, headphones.  Why don't you Jupiter walk for us?  All right.  Big A is going to do it. 
[03:28:00]  Don't Stop.  Very fucking funny.  Exactly.  Could you Pulsar walk for us?  You ready, Big A?  Step lightly.  You might collapse gravity.  Sorry.  Sorry, Andrew.  I didn't mean that.  Go ahead.  All right.  Big A's, uh, moving tribute to Michael Jackson.  Don't Stop till you get enough.  Familiar with this song?  Um, not really.  You want to hear the original to the hook?  Can we play the original to the hook just so Big A gets a feel for the song?  Here we go.  You know it now, Big A? 
[03:28:30]  Just listen.  Yeah.  It's pretty high.  Right?  It's a good one.  Sing it all high.  You can tell what he's saying.  Power.  Power.  Oh, power.  It's the first love love. 
[03:29:00]  That makes it happen.  And there's no questions for me.  Ooh.  Get closer.  Close enough.  Come on, baby.  All right, that's it. 
[03:29:30]  There you go.  How much?  There you go.  That's up to the chorus.  You always got to go to the hook.  Now you're familiar with the entire song.  You good?  You know the song.  You've heard it a few times, right, Big A?  And we want to hear that falsetto.  Like, you got to get your voice up there nice and hot. 
[03:30:00]  All right?  Big A is haunting tribute to Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson.  Do Michael proud, Big A.  So, hit that.  Howling is the feeling now.  Howling is the feeling now.  Fever.  Fever.  Fever.  Fever.  Temperature's rising now. 
[03:30:30]  Power.  All power.  Is the force that, well.  It can happen.  There's no question.  There's no questions why.  Closer now.  Barbie now.  Just love me. 
[03:31:00]  So, you don't know how.  The force doesn't help.  Don't stop to get enough.  Don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  Keep on with the force.  Don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  Don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  It's a little too fast.  What the hell? 
[03:31:30]  He's a little worked up.  What are you doing?  Like hot candle wax.  Sensation.  All sensation.  Tell me where you at.  Let you go.  Take us through the hours. 
[03:32:00]  We'll be complaining.  Because love the power.  The force don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  The force don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  We've had enough.  The force don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  Keep on.  Stop eating.  Don't stop.  Because you weigh enough. 
[03:32:30]  That's enough to say when he's choking a girl.  You can stop.  You can stop because she's had enough.  That's enough.  Don't stop eating.  That's enough.  Kill her.  Heart break.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[03:33:00]  Sing the goddamn song!  Get to it!  Come on, go!  What the fuck are you doing?  Don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  No, don't stop.  Don't stop to get enough.  Come on.  Don't stop.  What the fuck are you doing?  Harmonize!  Harmonize.  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:30]  And why are you okay with singing ST?  Yes.  That's the word that you have trouble with.  Hence the reason we picked don't stop to get enough.  Yes.  Wow, that worked.  Yeah.  It was still entertaining.  Yeah.  Still got a gift.  Moving tribute.  I like the part that's too fast for him.  Yeah, he just panics.  It's like watching him try to run downhill holding eggs in his hand. 
[03:34:00]  People are suggesting you got to sing Gotta Be Starting Something.  That's a hard one.  Maybe we'll cut our losses.  Because we're smart.  Yeah.  I'm moved.  All right, big A.  I actually got to stay on schedule today.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  Very important delivery.  Very important.  Oh, you do?  No one's going to be...  I know.  How come you closed the curtains during that song?  Yeah, why was that?  I was wondering that, too.  Just because we're filming and stuff.  Oh, okay.  Because...  Oh, you don't want people walking in the background? 
[03:34:30]  It doesn't matter that much.  I got to meet Anthony Michael Hall a little while for lunch, so...  Oh, really?  How long time you said hi?  Is that what you're doing?  Hmm.  Yeah, tell him I said hi.  You said you guys were very nice guys.  Oh, that's very nice of him.  He seemed like a very nice gentleman.  Oh, there's a couple of celebs, actors talking shop.  Of course.  There's two lawyers talking shop.  All right, why don't we close up?  Big A was the sheriff's office.  What happened to Sheriff's office?  You just didn't call?  Well, you know what?  No, I guess not. 
[03:35:00]  She was supposed to call.  God damn.  Yeah.  I don't want to give, you know, the old...  Hmm.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah, they've blown us up before.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Otto was terrific today.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Of course.  Anything else you want to say?  I think you did it all, Otto.  It's just great when you do a gig and you run it to the Opie and Anthony fans and they  come up to you and say, you know, I saw Voss last time.  I'm going to see Patrice next time.  It's like, I feel like I'm in a community, a comedy community for the first time. 
[03:35:30]  It's like a comedy retard home with our fans, but you're right.  It is a community, nonetheless.  It's cool, though.  They're loyal, man.  Yeah.  Loyal, loyal, loyal.  Yeah, they come out.  They do.  So, and for all of Otto's tour dates, OttoandGeorge.com, but the biggie is Zany's next weekend, next  Friday and Saturday, right, Otto?  Yeah, yeah, that's an easy one.  Zany's Comedy Club, Nashville, Tennessee.  I hear it's a great place.  Mm-hmm.  Go to Nashville.Zany's.com for ticket info to see Otto and George or OttoandGeorge.com  for all his dates.  Yep.  And that DVD you're selling, that's somewhere else. 
[03:36:00]  That's on Laugh.com.  You can get all your comedy needs on Laugh.com from George Carlin to Abbott and Costello.  It's the entire spectrum of comedy.  Great.  Yeah.  Big A, anything else?  Oh, yes.  I'd like to thank Dr. Steve.  Oh, boy.  Now we got the problem with the other.  Dr. Steve.  Wish we were thanking Dr. Kevorkian.  And check out Weird Medicine when it's on.  And for all your taxi needs, Alpha Cab in Edison, New Jersey. 
[03:36:30]  Taxi slash hearse.  Starts as one becomes the other.  And I want to plug two things.  My gigs, I'm doing also Zany's, but not the one Otto's doing.  I'll be in Vernon Hills, Illinois, July 17, 18.  And then the Punchline in Atlanta, Georgia, July 23, 25.  And then Rich Franchese's Club, July 31, August 1, Manhattan Comedy Club in Middletown.  It's supposed to be a nice little room.  Middletown.  Not an hour from the city.  And I'm looking forward to doing that. 
[03:37:00]  I love Rich.  845-346-4242.  Nice.  For tickets, motherfuckers.  All right, I guess that's it for today.  Yes, it is.  All right, kids.  That's where I met Carlin at that time.  Really?  In Vernon Hills.  He came out and saw me.  In Vernon Hills, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Did he like you?  Yeah, he drove over an hour and a half to see me.  He said he'd heard about me for years.  It was great.  Holy shit.  What a fucking honor.  That is a compliment.  I'm glad I didn't know he was in the audience because I probably would have choked.  But I did a good show and it was fucking great. 
[03:37:30]  And then it comes up.  He came right up to me in the kitchen, Otto, George, Carl.  And I was like, my fucking knees buckled.  It was amazing.  Were you surprised when he walked in the kitchen?  Oh, God.  It's like, you know, I mean, I've just been listening to him since childhood, you know?  It's just an idol of mine.  Yeah.  How did George take it?  George had the mirror.  George.  George.  I tweeted a picture of George.  I hate questions like that.  Oh, yeah.  Like Rayshon? 
[03:38:00]  That's from the TV show, right?  Yeah.  It's just a couple of them.  Oh, is that the one from...  It's a couple of comedy icons.  Let me take a look.  A comedy icon.  Yeah, you were an icon, Jim.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  Hmm.  Yeah, that is a good one, man.  He's just like a priest.  I got him to sign it, too.  Fuck.  That's what...  Yeah, it is.  You and George.  Well, you know.  Well, I don't, but you do.  Let's go home.  Well, you know George Costanza, Kramer.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Get it?  Yes, I do.  Because you say those words.  That's right, Jerry.  I do understand. 
[03:38:30]  Where did he go?  Man.  I'm digging my fingernails into my balls, and it feels super.  Yeah, it really feels good when you've got an itch down there.  Yeah, old taffy bag.  Oh, God.  Squeezing.  The best, though, is the grab and just roll.  Oh, yeah.  The skin, yeah.  The little roll.  Yeah.  Girls, can they do that with a labia itch?  It's so primal.  It's so good.  It is.  It's just like you go, ho, ho, ho.  You just want to scratch behind your ear with your foot.  Yeah.  It's really good.  Yeah.  The banjo spot.  When you hit a dog on a certain spot, and they start playing a banjo with their foot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Banjo with their foot.  Banjo?  Yeah.  All right, kids.  I'm going to take off, because I've got a delivery that I must be home for.  Beautiful.  720 horsepower's worth of delivery.  Oh, shit.  I have.  A boat?  A Saturn?  Oh, no.  This is a monster Mustang.  Wow.  Why do you have to go so fast?  I don't have to go fast.  I could keep it in first gear.  I won't.  How many horses do you need?  I want to take that to English Town. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  I'll throw some fucking, get a couple of slicks for the back.  I could probably do 10s.  There it is.  A Mustang?  That's the car.  That's your favorite new car?  That's my, well, it's my old car that I had sent out to Vegas to Shelby.  Oh.  Shelby works out there.  Had them redo the supercharger, rear end, and some other shit.  Good stereo and navigation system and everything.  Oh, it's, uh, no.  It's pretty much stripped down.  Oh, it is?  Just made for speed.  Look at that big, stupid charger.  How fast can that thing go?  I'll get that fucker, I'll get that fucker squeaking toward about 180. 
[03:40:00]  There's no need to go that fast.  You're never going to be that late for work.  There's no need, but, yeah, right?  Why are your fucking hobbies drinking and driving at the speed of sound?  Can't you have-  Don't forget guns.  Guns.  Why can't you like other things?  I enjoy Pinochle, and I enjoy word searches.  Yeah.  Jumping into packing peanuts.  No, it's just fun to, um, it's fun to drive that fast. 
[03:40:30]  Manly man.  It's fun to drive, like, fast.  Yeah, but sometimes when you hit things-  Well, I know, that's the bad part.  That's the part you don't want to do.  But it's fun to just kind of drive fast.  Steve McQueen fans.  Get the shifting right.  When you fucking run through the gears properly, oh, it's great.  I want to take that, though.  I want to go down to English Town.  I could probably do high tens, 10-8, 135 miles an hour.  You could right now be speaking Latin to me.  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
[03:41:00]  Ah.  You know enough cops that you have certain roads that you could probably-  Anthony says the cops don't dare even pull them over anymore.  No, I don't say that at all.  Oh.  I do not say that at all.  Anthony's like, go ahead, give me a ticket.  I'll fucking just get it fixed.  I have the utmost respect for law enforcement officers.  And if they do catch me in the midst of being very irresponsible, I am very respectful.  Yeah.  And any courtesy they extend me, I take with all the- 
[03:41:30]  Greedy Italian fists.  Honor and respect.  I agree.  You shouldn't pause, ever.  I know.  Why are you pausing?  I'm with Jimmy in the room, god damn it.  Oh, shit.  Thank you very much for a good program.  It was fun today, man.  It was a lot of fun.  Thank you, Otto.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hysterical.  It makes me laugh.  God damn it.  Absolutely.  Alright, I'm out of here. 
[03:42:00]  Bye, guys.  I don't know what you guys did there.  I'm out of here.  Thank you. </pre>
