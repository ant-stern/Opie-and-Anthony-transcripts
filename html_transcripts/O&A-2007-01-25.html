<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing the previous day's show, self-deprecatingly acknowledging praise received.  They then launched into a skeptical discussion of global warming, dismissing predicted consequences.  Their feud with the John and Jeff radio show was a major topic, focusing on a radio promo that unintentionally highlighted their show favorably, and their retaliatory, homophobic counter-promo.  Mancow Muller's "Foundation for Responsible Radio" was heavily criticized, contrasted with his past controversial stunts, including a fatal water-drinking contest.  The hosts also revisited the humorous recurring bit about a man killing a hooker while wearing a bunny suit. Other news items briefly covered included a skydiver charged with murder and a Dutch dating show for the disfigured.  Louis C.K. was mentioned as a recent and upcoming guest.

The John and Jeff feud continued, with extensive mocking of Jeff's loud muscle car.  This segment included a listener criticizing their humor regarding a sexually assaulted goat.  A significant portion featured an in-studio interview with Timothy Olyphant, promoting *Catch and Release*.  Their conversation covered Olyphant's career, the cancellation of *Deadwood*, his role in a *Die Hard* movie, experiences with stand-up comedy (including a negative encounter with Edward Norton), and anecdotes from various film and television projects, including working with Frank Whaley and a negative experience with Jay Mohr on *Dinner for Five*.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a skydiver's death due to a sabotaged parachute.

The show then reviewed *American Idol* auditions, focusing on Happy Nakia and Sarah Goldberg.  Their performances and subsequent behavior were dissected with highly offensive and vulgar language, including speculation about Sarah Goldberg having bipolar disorder.  The segment ended with further discussion of Tyra Banks' weight and a call from a trucker, continuing the use of crude humor and offensive language.

A substantial portion of the show involved a call from Amy, who identified as bipolar.  Her diagnosis was challenged by the hosts and callers, with repeated use of highly offensive language.  The discussion broadened to cover the nature of mental illness, with comparisons to ADHD.  Several callers, including Mongo the trucker, Matt from Arizona, and Fred, participated, using vulgar and offensive language.  Fred engaged in a particularly confrontational exchange with Amy, revealing personal information.  The show interspersed comments on live news coverage of student protests in Beirut, contrasting modern access to news with the past.  This segued into a darkly humorous discussion of historical hardships and lack of medical knowledge, including gruesome details about death and disease.  A shark attack survivor story, a text from Jimmy's ex-girlfriend Erin detailing her arrest after a violent altercation, and segments with a religious caller, David (who has cerebral palsy), whose messages were largely unintelligible, further filled the segment.  The show concluded with the weighing of E-Rock and accompanying off-color jokes.

The final segment focused on the "Line of the Day," highlighting listener submissions, particularly one about a "CP preacher."  A bit involving a prosthetic leg and a turkey sandwich and a Google search for "Russia" were also mentioned.  The segment briefly referred back to the "John and Jeff" segment, highlighting a perfectly timed bleep. The show ended with the usual outro and sponsors.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a whore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, see he, oh, do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Norton, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled for, why are you crying, the virus,  finally hit him, but with Jimmy, you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the O.P. and Anthony's show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A. 
[00:00:30]  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  You know what this means. 
[00:01:00]  Hi.  Ah.  Hi.  Ah.  Yes, good morning.  It means we're back again.  I know.  Jesus.  Anthony and I were just talking this old gag.  This old gag.  A lot of people were praising us on such a great radio show yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, fun-filled.  And Anthony and I are walking down the sidewalk feeling good about ourselves, little Jimmy, of course, as well, and ah, what a great show, we're all happy.  Yeah.  And then we go back to our, uh, our regular, regularly scheduled lives, and, uh, a mere few hours later, we gotta do it again!  Yep.  A blank slate.  That's it, clean slate.  What'd you do yesterday?  Doesn't, doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Guess what?  I didn't even hear it. 
[00:02:00]  I was out sick.  Make me laugh today, funny man.  I don't care what you did yesterday, I was sick.  Didn't even hear it.  How great was, uh, Louis C.K. yesterday, all day?  Unbelievable.  Over at XM, over here.  He was unbelievable, that's right.  He's a funny guy.  Just genuinely funny.  He'll be back on the program on Tuesday.  Goody good.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:30]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Is it?  What is America talking about this morning?  We want to know, America.  Give us a call.  Tell us what you think about the discovery of the Mississippi River.  Now that's a, that's a boon to our country.  It's almost time to put him out to pasture, huh?  Good old Larry King.  New world, fact or myth? 
[00:03:00]  Well, we got a little snow here in New York City, I see.  Oh, just a little bit.  A little bit on the, uh...  Flurries.  On the outskirts of town.  I don't even care about that.  I just care about tomorrow.  Just spelling gloom and doom for the temperature.  Uh, temperature, gloom and doom.  Oh, but tomorrow, forget about it.  It's going to be Arctic, uh, freezing cold.  Don't go outside.  Don't, uh, have your skin exposed.  Be sure to check the elderly.  They'll go through the checklist of things you're supposed to do when it's cold that common-sense people do. 
[00:03:30]  I'm happy when it gets really cold in the winter because, you know, for New York, it was in the mid-60s around Christmas.  Yeah.  You know, people in the New York area understand and other cities understand because it was happening to you as well.  Not talking about West Palm Beach, you guys, whatever.  You're, I don't know.  You got your own thing going on there as far as weather goes.  But, uh, when it's 60, 65 around Christmas, you're, you're happy that you're walking around in shorts and no coats and hats and, and gloves. 
[00:04:00]  From the back of your mind, you're like, ugh, is this global warming?  Nah, good.  Bring it on.  And then when you finally get normal winter temperatures like we're going to have, uh, tomorrow especially, you breathe a sigh of relief even though you're freezing your, you know what, off.  Bring on the global warming.  I have not a problem or issue with it.  I don't care.  I think the panicky Pete's that, uh, are, are, are screaming that this is a horrible thing are exaggerating. 
[00:04:30]  Did you, you hear these reports of people that are like, in the next 15 to 20 years, a lot of our major cities will be underwater if this continues.  Yeah, this is one of our favorite things.  Oh.  Because, well, they, they show the animation on TV, what New York City's going to look like in 15 or 20 years, and basically it's all the streets you know and love, and the subway's completely flooded with water.  Flooded.  They showed cars.  Cars floating in the water.  In the water.  And you look and go, really? 
[00:05:00]  Um, they've been, uh, chiming in with this global warming thing for a few years now.  Now they only give us, like, 20 years, and, and the cities are going to be, like, covered in water.  Wouldn't you notice, like, wouldn't you go down to the West Side Highway here in New York, or one of the beachfront highways somewhere else, and just go, wow, I'm really noticing the water creeping up.  Yeah.  If in 20 years it's going to be covered, believe me, you'd notice over the past five that it would have climbed a bit. 
[00:05:30]  There's not, it's not any higher than it ever was.  Not according to the animation, just one day we're going to wake up and go, hey, hey, how did this happen?  You're going to open your door, and, uh, it's just going to be underwater.  Why didn't, why weren't we warned?  No, it's going to slowly but surely creep.  If it does.  If it does at all.  And then guess what?  You know, there's too much to lose here in Manhattan, especially.  So I think.  You figure it out.  I think we're going to maybe start building some structures to keep the water out. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Wait, there's some type of solution that is there.  I don't think we've ever given up on something as human beings like that, where it's like, well, the water does seem to be encroaching on it.  All right.  Abandon New York City.  Right, right.  Abandon every major coastal city.  No.  You deal with it.  You go outside in the morning to get your newspaper.  Hey!  What the hell? 
[00:06:30]  There's 20 feet of water out here.  Who saw this coming?  My car is underwater.  I remember a puddle here and there.  Yeah.  I didn't pay attention to that.  Don't you think by the time 20 feet of water was in New York City that it would have been abandoned for years if there was no solution?  Oh, but to the point where there wouldn't be subway trains and cars floating around like it would just be done salvaged like people would have moved entire buildings brick by brick somewhere else.  But once again, the animation, they show it like you jumped in your car and said, you know what? 
[00:07:00]  I can drive in 20 feet of water.  Like you woke up for the morning commute, made it into work, and by afternoon commute, 20 feet of water.  20 feet of water.  God damn.  Now what are we going to do?  Enough.  Screw that evolution crap where it slowly but surely happens.  No, it happens immediately.  According to the dumb news, it's going to happen immediately.  I'd love to panic you.  So then when we get warm temperatures in December and even January, people start to, oh, boy, here it comes. 
[00:07:30]  Here it comes.  The ice caps.  The ice caps.  I was watching TV on Sunday, and they showed some ice caps kind of falling into the sea, my friend.  Yeah, it's been happening for years.  My friend.  It's called the glaciers pulling back still from the goddamn ice age.  And then they show, like, here's a mountain 100 years ago.  Look at this picture.  It's covered in snow.  Here it is today.  You can barely see any snow. 
[00:08:00]  And I look and go, and so what?  Things are changing.  Geology is changing.  Weather changes.  Everything changes.  The whole earth is a living little organism, and that changed, and glaciers are pulling back.  So what's the big deal?  Why does everybody freak out and think just because we're here on earth that earth is supposed to just stop doing what it does anyway?  I understand we're pumping exhaust fumes into the atmosphere, and that's contributing to it.  We're certainly helping it a lot. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, but since we are a part of this ecosystem, what we do, I consider it natural.  We have the ability to take dirt and pieces of trees and water from the seas and somehow smash it all together and make an aircraft.  It's brilliant.  It just happens to burn fuel and blow out huge amounts of gases that kind of screw with the atmosphere.  Oh, well.  Well, yeah.  If the planet doesn't want us here, it's going to shake like a wet dog, and we'll all go flying off of it, and it'll be fine. 
[00:09:00]  And then we'll realize how unimportant we really were.  Exactly, people.  We're not that important in the scheme of this planet.  Relatively speaking, the blink of an eye, we've been here.  Dinosaurs, they roamed around for millions of years just trotting about and then all of a sudden gone.  We haven't been here for even a million years, really, in this form. 
[00:09:30]  So deal with it.  All right.  If the earth wants us here, we'll be here.  If it doesn't, we're gone.  It's not the other way around.  We're not here to like, oh, the poor planet.  What are we going to do?  There's a species in the rainforest that is extinct now because of our encroachment.  Yeah.  That doesn't bum you out at all?  I can't even. 
[00:10:00]  That doesn't bum you out at all?  I can't even convey to you how much I don't care when a species disappears from the planet.  They show you that cute little creature.  A kinkachu?  That innocent, cute, little, adorable creature.  They're never adorable creatures.  You don't feel for it a little bit.  It's usually some bug that looks like a stick.  A bug with massive eyes.  Yeah, big eyes.  Looks like it's from another planet to begin with.  So maybe it's just going home.  Yeah.  It's just, who cares?  Maybe it decides, you know what?  My vacation's over.  I got to go back to where I'm from.  For some reason, important animals, we decide to help out. 
[00:10:30]  Like the American Eagle.  Remember when that was endangered?  Oh, yeah.  It's off the endangered list.  It's great.  See, we can fix stuff if we really want to.  If there's something roaming around the floors of the rainforest that we don't even know about,  and so we can plow under some trees and build some factories,  this thing winds up disappearing from the face of the earth,  I don't really have much sympathy.  I don't care about a bug.  I don't care about an owl, a little hooty owl in the Pacific Northwest. 
[00:11:00]  They couldn't build something because there was a hoot owl.  Who cares?  You live in the moment.  You got to.  People don't realize.  You're not going to have kids, so you don't care what you leave behind.  But the kids, see, that's another thing.  I don't care.  I think if you have kids, you worry a little bit more because you want to make sure they're set up nice.  But that's such a pompous way of thinking as a person, as a human, as a life form. 
[00:11:30]  Don't worry.  You're not going to save the world for your kids either.  It will be your kids' issue to fix whatever problems come up.  I'm not even saying save the world, just caring.  Caring for the world.  Yeah.  Making it the better place for your child.  You just don't care in general.  It doesn't work that way.  Right.  What happens is the humans, the new humans, the children, they take over for what we were doing and fix the problem.  We're a big problem here on this planet apparently. 
[00:12:00]  We're different from every other thing that's on this planet.  We have this divine spark of thought and communication that's very specific.  Which proves we're not from here.  Well, perhaps.  That's another argument.  No, we're not from here.  It's very obvious.  That's why we're so uptight.  We're not comfortable because this isn't our environment.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  We're the only type of creature like this really.  You could look at the ape or something like that. 
[00:12:30]  But I mean – but we're problem solvers.  So if there's – if we're – our generation dies off and leaves a bunch of children, they – as they grow up and encounter these problems that perhaps we even left for them, they're not going to just go –  And run around Earth going, what do we do?  Our parents aren't here to fix this.  They fix the things themselves.  We've had to do it.  Well, as people, you come up with new technology. 
[00:13:00]  It actually helps the human mind advance and technology advance because you have to solve problems.  So you think we're fixing stuff that our parents and their parents like –  Of course we are.  Couldn't?  Yeah.  Interesting.  We're problem solvers.  Interesting.  People are problem solvers.  What the hell?  We make our own problems, but we tend to be able to solve them so we could sit on this rock a little longer.  What the hell does this have to do with the weather dropping down to 10 degrees?  Global warming.  That's all I said.  Global warming and it's going to be freezing cold. 
[00:13:30]  That's all we were talking about.  That's going to be cold tomorrow.  Bunch of peak panics.  It's too dark to do doom and gloom radio.  I know.  You look out the window and go –  Hey, mommy.  Maybe when the sun pops up for us, then we can get a little braver with our speech.  It's even stupid Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  Long Island is saying the same thing.  Larry.  Let's go to Larry on Long Island.  Larry, what's up?  Hi, Larry.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Good morning, Larry.  I just think, Ant, the only reason why you don't really want to save anything is like 
[00:14:00]  Hope said.  You're not going to have any kids.  So what do you care?  You're just going to be driving around in your car, doing 110, polluting the stuff out  of everything.  Yeah, but I explain that.  Like our kids – by our, I mean collective, not mine.  We're not having kids.  But it's like the kids grow up into people that then are faced with dilemmas and problems  and good things.  You know, they're just – it's called life.  It's been going on for years.  It's not a lot, like I said, but they will fix problems. 
[00:14:30]  There hasn't been one generation on this planet that has just screamed, pulling their  hair out, going, we're doomed.  I can't think of anything.  Can you?  You know?  There was – look at the 1500s and the 1400s.  Half the frigging globe was dying of the bubonic plague.  They had things like that.  You know, things went on.  People, years ago, a lot of diseases.  What about the turn of the century?  Like, well, in the early 1900s, the flu epidemic took out. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Influenza.  A massive amount of people.  And you know what happens?  They come up with the flu shots and they come up with better ways of sterilizing things  and they come up with other – and you fix these problems.  Anthony is a realist, by the way, because –  Thank you.  You know, there are a lot of people out there that do care about the earth, but none of  us actually do anything about it.  No.  No one's actually driving around in an electric car because they say it's better.  No one is really recycling to the point that it would make a difference. 
[00:15:30]  I'll give one guy credit.  Ed Begley Jr.  He's riding that goddamn bicycle to work every day.  What a tool.  I hope he gets hit by a Prius.  Come on, people.  Follow my lead.  How great with that.  Follow my lead.  Gets hit by a hybrid car.  I'm so sorry.  I've run over Ed Begley Jr.  On his bicycle.  With that kind of attitude, though, it's kind of the same thing as like, you know, like  with all the gangs in the streets of L.A. and everything.  I think, Anthony, your attitude would be, well, why don't we just, you know, arm them  so they could just kill each other and that'll take care of the problem.  That is the dumbest analogy I've ever heard in my life. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  It makes no sense at all.  And that means your time with the Opie and Anthony show is over.  Done, Larry.  Goodbye, Larry.  I just think people put a little too much credence into people.  You're putting a little too much importance on our existence here on this planet and a  little too much importance on our effect on the planet itself.  Don't worry.  I just walk around the streets of New York and I laugh at people because I look at them 
[00:16:30]  and I go, everyone thinks they're the most important person in the world.  They think their lives matter.  They think their little job and waiting online at the bank and getting groceries and paying  bills and watching American Idol at night is so important in the overall scheme of things.  Oh, it's...  We stink.  Our lives mean crap in the end.  Little organisms running around, just squirming on a frigging round Petri dish.  Right.  But we think we're so important that we're going to knock down an entire forest to build 
[00:17:00]  new houses.  Don't worry about it.  And that's another thing.  Deforestation is destroying the...  All right.  You know something?  For the time being, for this portion in time, it's probably not a good thing.  But have you ever seen a town that was deserted?  I used to take drives...  Love Canal up there in the Buffalo area.  Yeah, Love Canal's an example.  I drove through that many, many times.  But there's like towns through the desert that were there... 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, shut my phone off.  There are towns through like the Mojave Desert on the old Route 66 and things that were booming  towns.  And then when the freeway, the big freeways went through, people just abandoned these places.  I know.  Left them.  They talk about that in the movie Cars.  There is nary a bit of evidence that they even existed.  You might see a foundation to a house or a building or a little piece of concrete where  a sign was for a diner or something.  You're saying nature is pretty much taking over these towns? 
[00:18:00]  Right.  The earth destroys this.  Evidence of humans being on this planet can be...  If we were like wiped out tomorrow, evidence of us being here would be eradicated in relatively  speaking, on earth terms, such a short period of time, it would be ridiculous.  This planet would be this fresh, new, green, friggin' lovely planet.  All right, chill out, man.  It's too dark for this crap.  Yeah?  Am I creeping people out?  Yeah, you're creeping people out. 
[00:18:30]  Good.  Wake up.  Mommy, what do you mean something?  I'm going to die.  I didn't go that far.  But...  Oh, that was a treat when you figured that out for the first time.  Oh, that was just wonderful.  I think my parents told me as they were leaving for the night.  All right, have fun.  Have fun.  Dwelling on that for a while.  Have fun dwelling on that in the darkness while we go to dinner and a movie.  But...  Oh, my God.  I have some questions.  I remember that day like it was yesterday. 
[00:19:00]  Just going along with my little life.  My little life then was just so easy.  Yeah.  And then that thought finally sank in.  Do you think Egypt was just those pyramids?  Yeah.  That was it?  Mm-hmm.  Just the pyramids and that stupid, noseless Sphinx.  That's all that was there.  It was a huge, thriving metropolis.  And now all that's left...  And that's, relatively speaking, a short period of time, a couple thousand years on this planet. 
[00:19:30]  It's nothing.  And it's pretty much needed to pile up rocks, natural things, just rocks in piles.  That was the only evidence that they existed.  By the way, Yellow Yoda from Wack Bag.  Opie, did you say the movie Cars?  Fragot.  Yeah, Cars.  I get all my knowledge.  I haven't seen that movie yet, but I...  I get all my knowledge from cartoons.  Well, we all should.  All right, listen.  We're just getting started here. 
[00:20:00]  Will Donald Trump call into the Opie and Anthony show today?  Probably not.  Mankow is a douche.  American Idol.  Is this a replay?  Dick Cheney.  Netherlands plans dating show for the visibly disfigured.  What did you think the first time you heard that?  I'm thinking...  I thought we have a contestant.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was thinking we got to get a half-hulk face involved in that.  Yeah.  And have you heard about the skydiver? 
[00:20:30]  Oh, that's a...  This is a...  Refreshing little story.  Skydiver charged with murder after love rival fell 13,000 feet.  It's murder.  Murder.  This is an unbelievable story.  We'll get into that as well.  We got lots to do.  Oh, yeah.  And John and Jeff.  And our own station is effing us as far as the John and Jeff thing goes.  Yes, they are.  They are effing us and we're not happy.  They're using our own audio against us.  Yeah.  We'll explain that in a few minutes as well.  Phones are lit.  That's very nice.  I like that.  Yeah.  Our phone number, just write it down for a future day, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:21:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's go right to the phone and say hi to John on Long Island.  John, what's going on today? 
[00:21:30]  Hey.  Hello there.  Hello there.  How are you doing?  Good.  Listen, why can't you guys get along with John and Jeff?  You know, Anthony, Jeff also owns a Mustang.  You could bond with him.  You're obviously being sarcastic, sir, right?  There's no way we'd ever get along with a show like John and Jeff.  Well, see, he said this morning that, hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, okay.  He said what? 
[00:22:00]  Let's go, John.  He said this morning he got pulled over in his Mustang by a cop because his muffler was  playing a melodical tune and it sounded so sweet that the cop wanted to know what kind  of muffler he had.  Wow.  No, no, no, no.  I know you.  Are you car crashing John and Jeff or the caller?  Uh, because that's, that's exactly what, is that what they did?  That's what they were talking about on their dumb show today.  Yes.  Oh God. 
[00:22:30]  See, I still can't figure it out.  What was it?  Exhausted mufflers for three hours?  One of them has a muscle car and the other one was complaining because he's not doing his  part for the environment by having one of those mufflers that makes it sound really loud.  So, um, for three hours they were complaining about, um, how having a muscle car is only  out to impress other men, not your woman that you're dating or married to and not what you  should be concerned about in the environment, not impressing other guys.  This went on for three hours about mufflers.  Three hours. 
[00:23:00]  Now I understand a lot of America have no idea who John and Jeff are, by the way, Jimmy turned  us on to John and Jeff, uh, well over a year ago.  They're out of LA and there are two guys that are doing nice radio.  So I'm sure ahead of his time.  So I'm sure man cows really into the John and Jeff show.  They're just nice.  And even when someone trashes them, they're just, they know how to diffuse it in a nice  way.  They just talk about mundane.  Who gives a crap?  Nice stuff.  Nice stuff.  Nice radio.  Nice boys. 
[00:23:30]  And, uh, they're pretty much the polar opposite of this fine radio show.  And, uh, they're on before us here in New York and in a few other cities across America.  And I guess someone like, uh, called them about us this morning.  Yeah.  And they had nothing but nice things to say.  How do you say nice things about this despicable program after we just trash you?  And, and yeah, well, I don't know.  These guys have to, this has to be a theater of the mind kind of goof show.  These guys have to be like scumbags and they're just, they get on the air and just do a nice 
[00:24:00]  show and then laugh about what they did.  Well, you know, just, just keep, uh, get everyone up to speed.  Here's a promo for the John and Jeff show.  Just shows you how much different they are than us.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think women who keep their maiden names in marriage are high maintenance.  We're two guys who think DNA tests should be mandatory before a man's name goes on a birth certificate.  We're two guys who think nobody should get married before the age of 30. 
[00:24:30]  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys that think nobody should get married unless it's to another man.  We're two guys who don't understand why realtors show pictures of themselves.  We're two guys who think it's cheaper to have an affair than getting a divorce.  We're two guys who think homeschooling is a brainwashing cult.  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  I liked his, um, Steve C delivery on the phone. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, realtors have a picture.  We're two guys who shave our arms.  So then we decided to use their style and make our own promo.  Don't worry, this is leading to a new chapter.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're two guys that hate when **** cut us off in traffic.  We're two guys that'll give you the courtesy of a reach around.  We're two guys that think a flight to Thailand is much too long. 
[00:25:30]  We're two guys that think the age of consent should be nine.  Stay away from me, Jim Norton.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  We're just, I'm not going to say it because we'll get dumped out of it.  We're two guys that think **** is delicious.  So, uh, John Minnelli.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  What's up with John Minnelli?  We get along with John Minnelli.  We go way back with John Minnelli.  He's our program director.  He used to write for the, uh, New York Post and now he's the program director here in  New York City.  Yeah.  He was the one that is responsible for bringing the John and Jeff show to the airwaves here  in New York City and, and maybe other, probably just New York City, I guess.  Was he drinking?  I'm hoping.  Did he have a drinking problem?  I'm hoping.  Did he wake up and go, whoa, what did I do last night?  Holy jeez, I signed what? 
[00:26:30]  He's usually pretty perceptive, but on this one, I think he might've missed the boat.  So, uh, he writes me an email and he's like, I'm enjoying you guys beating up on my boys,  John and Jeff.  And he calls them my boys, John and Jeff.  His boys.  Uh-oh.  And, uh, and, and then he goes, I'm thinking of using what some of the things you've said  or you guys have said for a, uh, John and Jeff promo.  And then I'm thinking, that's why John Minnelli is the program director here in New York City.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  Because he's thinking out of the box. 
[00:27:00]  We need more people on regular radio to think out of the box and do things differently.  So stupid me, I'm thinking there's going to be a John and Jeff promo where we're just  beating the crap out of them.  Crash them.  Just killing them, right?  Yep.  This is what he did.  This is what he meant.  And I know what he's going for.  He thinks people are going to catch on and realize that, uh, that we're truly trashing  them, but we're not in the promo.  Spliced together creatively, but you can tell.  You can tell that, uh, that this makes us look like we really like the show instead of 
[00:27:30]  mocking the show.  Yeah.  Listen for yourself.  3FM.  Late nights, 286A.  It's the John and Jeff Show.  Now endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  It's two guys out of L.A. and they're nice.  I enjoyed the program.  Oh, God.  They're terrific.  John and Jeff.  It's what they call the spice of life.  I get it.  Very nice.  John and Jeff.  Just very sweet.  Qualified to give people advice.  Yeah, absolutely.  There are some mornings I cannot turn that off.  It's so funny.  John and Jeff.  It's so funny.  Late nights, 2 to 6. 
[00:28:00]  It's funny.  Now, O&A approved.  You gotta listen.  92.3 Free FM.  See, the promo was put together so well that no one gets the joke.  It doesn't look like.  It really looks like we're truly endorsing these guys.  You're supposed to know that we were bashing them and through some bad editing.  Right.  It's trying to make it sound like we're putting them over and making them sound good.  But it just sounds like we're endorsing them.  Yeah.  No one's getting the joke.  No.  No one's getting that joke.  And now we look like idiots because we're actually telling our listeners that this show 
[00:28:30]  is good.  Tim, you put that together, right?  No.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  You will not find whoever is responsible for that.  They don't exist anymore.  Well, that's gotta go.  That's gotta go.  Yeah.  I mean, if he wants to make like a promo where the splicing and the editing is so bad  it's obvious what's going on there, then fine.  But he can't make it sound like we really like this show.  We don't like this show.  It's, as we said, not our cup of tea. 
[00:29:00]  It's too controversial.  You know all the stans they take?  Oh, my goodness.  We're in a...  Goodness gracious.  We're in a huge fight right here for our lives.  They're trying to change radio in front of our eyes.  We are?  What?  Yes.  You got Man Cow...  Someone in here trying to kill us?  You got Man Cow...  He's trying to, like, start a movement for responsible radio.  Ugh.  You got the John Jeff show, which is just a nice show.  They want nice radio.  And we refuse to buckle. 
[00:29:30]  We refuse.  Stupid Man Cow made millions of dollars on doing shock jock radio.  And now he's coming out with a press release.  What, yesterday was it?  Yeah, trying to, uh...  Do we have that dumb press release from Man Cow?  Trying to keep people from doing entertaining radio, or fun radio, because of what happened  to that woman at the edge there in Sacramento.  Uh, I forgot her name already.  Uh, Jennifer Strange.  Oh, yeah.  Good old Jennifer Strange.  I just remember the strange part.  Yeah.  And I remember the first name, because, well... 
[00:30:00]  Well...  You know...  That name put me through a lot of hell.  I have to write it on a check every...  Yeah.  ...quarter.  Well, uh...  And we're on in Chicago.  Yeah.  A man cow was huge in Chicago.  We all know that.  But, uh...  Yeah, he decided, uh...  I don't know what he decided, to be honest with you.  I think he was still doing, like, shock jock type of things.  Yeah.  But it wasn't working anymore.  And his audience was drastically dropping.  Then he decided to change his act out of nowhere, make believe he never did the shock  jock stuff, and his ratings plummeted to the point where his hometown station there 
[00:30:30]  in Chicago, I know he's not from there originally, uh, got rid of him.  So now he's, like, trying to, you know, continue with his radio career in these, like, just...  Just these out-of-the-way places.  Well, I'm a Christian now.  I'm a Christian, and, uh, I'm trying to, uh, clean up the airwaves.  What?  The second they put him on the Fox News thing, uh, to blab about something for a couple of  minutes in the morning... 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  ...he decided he was, uh, the new Sean Hannity.  Yeah.  Like, he was gonna just put that whole thing behind him.  And, uh, talk about the issues that are important to our families and me as, uh,  Christian, shut up.  He did some great things in Chicago radio, but in the end, he let down his audience.  Simple as that.  Yeah, it's obvious.  And, uh, this is his latest thing that just makes me want to puke in his face.  Makes me want to do a baby bird right into Mancow's face. 
[00:31:30]  The baby bird.  Mancow calls for the end of dangerous, voyeuristic radio stunts.  The guy is a multi-millionaire for doing this type of radio.  For doing the shocking shock jock radio bits.  It did good by him, but now he's gonna turn around and, like, now trash everybody that's  still doing kind of edgy, uh, outrageous, uh, uh, stunt radio at times.  Well, my religious beliefs have led me, uh, to a place where I don't feel this is appropriate 
[00:32:00]  anymore, um, for, uh, children or, uh, families.  Really?  He thought it was appropriate back in 1993 when he tied up traffic on the San Francisco, uh,  uh, bridge there during rush hour, using vans to block the westbound lanes of the bridge  while his then sidekick got a haircut, uh, parodying, uh, President Clinton's haircut  on Air Force One that tied up traffic at LAX.  What happened?  There was no problem there.  What happens if there was an emergency vehicle that needed to get through, uh, get to somebody 
[00:32:30]  that was in traffic, couldn't get there in time, and the person died?  The guy is the biggest phony, the biggest hypocrite.  He still wants to have his, uh, his, his, his name recognition and his, uh, and his name  in print and on the news, and he can't do it with his radio show anymore, so now he's  going to turn his back on, uh, on, uh, this type of radio, even though it made him a multi-millionaire.  Yeah.  A multi-millionaire.  The police blotter, uh, uh, Sneed hears the radio twitch man cow was arrested naked Thursday 
[00:33:00]  morning in front of the Museum of Contemporary Art.  This happened back in, uh, 01, Anthony.  And hauled into the 18th District Police Station.  He was protesting school art program cutbacks and asked his listeners to sketch him.  Ah, I was, uh, taking a jail naked where I was repeatedly raped.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Um, yeah, he was hauled away naked man cow, got slapped on the butt with a minor ticket-like  offense.  Uh, slapped in the butt with a, oh, a ticket? 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  And then he done, then he did his stupid contest like eating cat food.  Ah, see?  I'm sure that was real safe, right, man cow?  Yeah, it was safe.  If you were taking a chance when you were doing your cat food eating contest, you hack.  There were plenty of, uh, instances where, uh, he, uh, people could have been injured.  Or how about walking into a Chinese dry cleaner with a bloodstained shirt and pretending to  be nervous over a supposed murder?  Or, uh, what if the person got all scared and, uh, uh, pulled out a gun and, uh, fired and,  uh, missed you and hit an innocent bystander? 
[00:34:00]  How about Grand Theft Auto?  Contestants would be issued car keys and then told to find an expensive automobile parked  on a busy Chicago intersection.  One of the keys would actually work.  So the listeners would have to go around just trying their key on really nice cars in the  area.  Uh, that's not going to cause a problem with the real owner of the car?  You dope could get shot.  You dope, but now he's, uh, all against all this stuff, huh?  And it goes on and on.  Trust me.  Once again, this guy made millions of dollars dollars doing, uh, shock, shock radio stuff. 
[00:34:30]  Shock, shockery.  So he comes out yesterday.  Man cow calls for the end of dangerous voyeuristic radio stunts, Chicago, man cow announced that  he is creating the foundation for responsible radio.  This is why Chicago doesn't want you anymore.  Man cow.  The foundation for responsible radio.  The people that used to listen to you are embarrassed by your actions.  And this is of course, is in response to the water intoxication death of Jennifer Strange,  whose tragic death was the result of what man cow calls a voyeuristic FM radio stunt. 
[00:35:00]  The same type of stunt that he used to do that got him really big ratings and got him really  huge contracts.  The guy is typing this from a mansion somewhere.  He should be ashamed of himself.  Sacramento's KDND held a water drinking contest called hold your wee for wee.  We all know by now, right?  Contestants were told to drink a certain amount of water every 15 minutes with the last person  that didn't throw up or go to the bathroom being the winner of Nintendo's latest gaming 
[00:35:30]  console called the week.  Jennifer Strange pulled out of the competition complaining of a headache and was found dead  in her living room that afternoon by her mother.  The 28-year-old mother of three who worked at blah, blah, blah, had told fellow contestants  that she was hoping to win the game console for her kids.  Last week, man cow made appearances on Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, and The O'Reilly Factor,  not because the guy cares.  No.  He doesn't give a crap.  He just wanted to get his stupid face on TV because no one is paying attention to his  actual radio show that used to be really popular, especially in Chicago. 
[00:36:00]  And that is nowhere now.  Right.  Just like nowhere to be found.  Little small towns here and there.  So he's got to hop on a controversy.  He's got to jump on a dead woman's body to try to get publicity.  He's in towns.  I mean, if you gave me the list of some of these towns on a list, I would swear they were  in England somewhere.  Yeah.  A weird England town.  Never heard of him.  No clue.  So he was on there sharing his views and his opinions, right?  Man Cow expressed anger and frustration that these types of things are still going on.  And this is why Bill O'Reilly's a hack, by the way. 
[00:36:30]  He had Man Cow on, spewing how bad this type of radio is, and didn't even challenge the  guy and say, excuse me, didn't you used to do this stuff?  Aren't you a multi-millionaire because you did exactly this?  Right.  That's why he's a hack.  No spins on my ass.  And then when he said he's the fastest growing show in America, he didn't call him out on that  either.  Right.  He's the fastest shrinking show.  Yeah.  The guy was in a major market and now he's nowhere, nowhere to be found. 
[00:37:00]  Man Cow expressed anger and frustration that these type of things are still going on.  Small markets feel the need to do this to get ratings, and it is wrong, said Man Cow.  Man Cow went on to say, voyeuristic radio has died or gone to satellite.  America doesn't want this stuff.  No, America does want this type of thing.  It wants entertaining radio.  That's what America wants, to be entertained.  And part of that is goofing on people, having people come in and do certain things spontaneously  or planned, stunts, things like that. 
[00:37:30]  Homeless shopping spree, things like that.  It's fun stuff.  He made his bones doing all that, and now he's like, ah, ah.  It's like one of these born-again Christians.  Right.  They just don't understand.  They have no recollection of what the real world is like and what was working well for  you.  Right.  Now, everybody's supposed to follow him like the Pied Piper.  Voyeuristic radio has died or gone to satellite.  Really? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Man Cow is extending an invitation to the radio community to help in the creation and support  of his new organization, and this is why you are not heard in Chicago anymore.  The Foundation for Responsible Radio.  That sounds great.  Where do I join?  Man Cow promised further information would be available soon at FoundationForResponsibleRadio.com. 
[00:38:30]  What a tool.  Who would join the likes of the Foundation for Responsible Radio?  Just leave the business then.  Just leave.  You're not going to be there.  You pretty much have.  You're not going to be the next Sean Hannity, so just give it up.  Congratulations, though.  You made a great living.  You made millions of dollars doing exactly what you want to now destroy.  Now, what we got here, turd, turd, you're in the car, and you're heading toward a wall. 
[00:39:00]  Is that it?  The airbag's going to go off now.  Turd, turd, are you okay?  Yeah.  He had a guy named Turd on his show.  That would do horrific things.  Yeah, that would do things that most of them, though, weren't going to put him in danger because it was all fake stage stuff.  Yeah, he did a lot of fake radio.  But turd also did a lot of things that took his life in his own hands.  Yeah.  So man cow could enjoy the massive contract. 
[00:39:30]  The fruits of other people's labor.  Turd would take the chances with his own life.  That's right.  Our turd was never paid properly.  Come here, turd.  So man cow could continue living in a mansion.  But he's going to forget all about that now.  Oh, this is the bit you're talking about, by the way.  Turd?  Yes, sir.  Are you ready, bud?  15.  15 miles an hour.  Listen how phony this is, by the way.  Another thing.  I think Chicago started realizing that the guy was just a complete phony and faking half his crap. 
[00:40:00]  And said, man, we're educated now.  We know this is like sound effects and stuff.  Yeah.  It's all produced.  We want to hear the real thing.  Turd?  Yes, sir.  Are you ready, bud?  15.  15 miles an hour.  He's going to give us the countdown.  20.  He's racing into the side of a factory.  25.  I'm sorry.  30.  30 miles an hour.  Anything happens to have power for you?  35.  35 miles an hour right now.  Oh, my God.  Maximum speed of 60.  30.  A long horse has been set up.  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:30]  Come on, Turd.  35.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That is...  Yeah, excuse me.  Yeah, of course the phone.  Of course the phone.  Of course the dial tone.  You got the same sound effect on a machine.  Dude, it's so obviously a sound effect.  That's not how a car crashes.  You don't hear a car crash.  It's a sound effect.  It's a movie type. 
[00:41:00]  Like a lot of glass and things.  Car crashes, we've all been in accidents.  They don't sound like that.  No.  It's a very low thud metallic thing that happens.  It's a thud that just goes right through you.  Yeah, you know it when you hear it.  That's for sure.  And that ain't it.  It's not a balanced sound because it's in a studio with perfect acoustics, you ass.  And he's up to 65 miles an hour with just like, what, a seatbelt?  Was that pretty much what the gag was supposed to be?  Yeah, they were testing it.  He wasn't in like a new car.  Oh, it was an airbag?  Yeah, they were testing an airbag. 
[00:41:30]  I'm not sure it was.  Phone?  Oh, God.  How fake.  Was Tred okay?  I think he ended up okay.  Yeah, he walked back down the hall.  Are you okay?  We'll get an update.  And they said, oh, that was such a great job.  Take the rest of the day off because you can't be hurt on the show now today.  Yeah.  He probably did it before his vacation.  So he was out a week.  And then he came back, oh, you're out of the hospital.  I was in the hospital for a while.  Oh, wow.  Wow, it's so weird that your hospital stay was exactly a week. 
[00:42:00]  What, were you laying in a tanning bed instead of a hospital bed?  You're awfully tanned for being in the hospital.  What a douche.  Bright lights in the hospital there got turned.  What a douche.  Man, cow.  Complete ass.  So there you go.  That's what he's up to.  He tried to set the radio world on fire with that dumb press release yesterday.  Well, much success. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, and if you want responsible radio, a lot of people like Carrie.  Well, let Carrie say it here.  Carrie, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  If you're looking for responsible radio, go to AM.  Yeah, if you want responsible radio, go to AM.  Go to Radio Disney.  Oh, there you go.  That's responsible.  That's right.  There's plenty of responsible radio.  The John and Jeff show, that's responsible radio.  Right.  You won't hear anything controversial there or interesting.  Right.  Responsible for homosexual activity. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  And that dumb show in Sacramento, they weren't taking any chances in their minds.  It was an unfortunate thing that happened to Jennifer Strange.  Absolutely.  And I truly do feel bad for her and her family.  But that type of radio has been going on for decades and nothing has ever happened.  That was the safest show.  It was such a safe show.  What if someone choked to death doing the Nathan's hot dog thing that they put on television every year?  Yeah.  Right.  That's an absolute possibility.  It's probably not going to happen. 
[00:43:30]  If someone choked to death doing that silly little interview contest.  It would be so similar to what happened.  The odds are so ridiculous, especially with a radio show, with that happening to a radio show.  And it did happen, and that sucks.  We got the John and Jeff muffler discussion.  Oh, boy.  We're really.  Wow.  But this is probably perfect for Man Cow's new organization, Responsible Radio.  Yeah.  Foundation for Responsible Radio would enjoy this type of broadcasting. 
[00:44:00]  That's right.  I'm certain of it.  And I got a message for Chicago today because we're on WCKG.  I'm sorry that Man Cow let you guys down.  I really am.  He was doing some great things for you guys, and then he lost his effing mind.  Yeah.  I think he did kind of go a little crazy.  I think everybody that makes that real quick turn in life.  Right.  You know, that I'm going to change this.  And it's kind of, yeah, when all of a sudden you find Jesus and stuff.  It's all well and fine. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, whatever, you know, makes you feel better.  But there's always something going on.  You don't just decide one day, you know, I think I'm just going to, you know, find Jesus.  There's always some kind of low you hit.  Yeah.  Or something happened.  Or you have some kind of a little psychological thing kind of happens.  And that's why you're looking for that.  Usually when you find Jesus, it's because you were found in like a, I don't know, a pink bunny suit with the front of it cut out. 
[00:45:00]  And the back cut out of it.  Crying next to a bleeding hooker.  I love that bit.  I didn't know.  We were just laughing and talking.  I can't even look.  It's my favorite bit, man.  We just got to throw that bit online because we refer to it all the time.  How long is that bit?  Like a half hour?  I love that bit.  Just the responsible guy, the family guy.  He decides, after just years of wanting to do this, he decides to get a hooker and just be real kinky. 
[00:45:30]  He let out his kink.  He wants to dress in a bunny suit and just have sex with a hooker.  And something goes terribly wrong.  And he ends up like killing her somehow or she dies.  And he's just sitting on the edge of the bed.  While the cops are interviewing him in his bunny suit, all bloody in the front.  Oh, be careful.  This isn't responsible radio.  No.  And he's just crying.  I was... 
[00:46:00]  My wife and kids.  Oh, my wife and kids are gonna...  And he keeps looking back at the hooker just laying there with her eyes glazed open.  Just bleeding.  We were having fun.  And she...  Oh, my God.  I can't...  Anthony does this for me.  I know.  I can't get enough of that.  I love that scene.  I mean, he's just sitting there trying to figure out what his next move is.  What's your next move when you're in a bloody bunny suit with a dead hooker next to you?  And then your jeans are like draped over a chair and the cell phone's in the pocket. 
[00:46:30]  It's ringing and you see that it's home calling.  Oh.  That's my wife.  The number's my wife.  Oh.  It's just over.  There's no getting out of it.  You're done.  You're done.  One indiscretion.  One night.  Didn't someone animate that bit?  Oh, yeah.  It's on what?  Whackbag and opianthony.com?  Yeah.  It was part of our video contest.  Yeah.  Someone animated it.  Oh, God.  It's really creepy looking.  I can't get enough of that bit. 
[00:47:00]  Just a dude.  He's had a...  Just an average life in general.  He's on the road.  He's looking for one little night of excitement.  I've had this weird itch for 20 years.  You know what?  I'm just going to do it one time.  Yeah.  One time.  I'm going to troll for a hooker.  Since it's only once, I got to do every...  Like, I got to let my fantasies out.  I want to be in a bunny suit.  I'm going to get my freak on.  And I really want to have some violent sex with a hooker.  And I'm going to do this.  And then she's just dead.  And then I'll go back to my loving family. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And then I know it'll be out of my system for good.  And then I can continue with my average life for another 20 years.  I'm just...  I'm a parts dealer for an automotive firm.  And I just wanted to...  Oh, God.  Oh, I thought it was a dream.  Is she okay?  The EMTs are just, like, looking over at each other, like, shaking their head.  Pulling the sheet up over her.  No, no. 
[00:48:00]  Our scenario is that he just tries to completely...  ...hide the crime until then.  It's just impossible.  He can't do it.  Yeah, can't do it.  Like, he starts by calling the front desk and saying,  Uh, can I have a late checkout?  Yeah.  I'm going to need a late checkout.  You wrap the dead hooker in the shower curtain.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe I could somehow get her out of the hotel room with the shower curtain.  But you're just...  You're a parts dealer for an automotive firm.  What do you know about disposing of a body? 
[00:48:30]  And then you're like,  Well, I know I could get away with this.  But then they're going to ask where the shower curtain went.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I'm in so much trouble.  Next thing you know, you got, like, a...  Like, some kind of saw, and you're just sawing body parts away in the bathtub.  Just, yeah.  You have to throw...  That was...  That's how the story went.  He throws her in the bathtub and tries to disassemble her so he can get her out a piece at a time.  And he's just never used this horror.  He's just snapped.  He's in a completely blood-soaked bunny suit trying to saw in half with, like, a butter knife he got from room service. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, God, it's my favorite thing.  Oh, it's just so horrific.  Phone's ringing, and the little kid is back from Boy Scouts, just wants to tell his dad how it went.  Yeah.  And he's in the bunny suit still trying to keep a straight face.  That's great, son.  A calm demeanor.  That's great. 
[00:49:30]  I'll be...  Daddy will be home soon.  You know, it's a great scene, sort of like that, is when William H. Macy in Fargo is sitting down after the debacle with the money exchange happens,  and his father-in-law's dead, his wife is kidnapped, like, everything went wrong.  And he's just sitting there, and his son is asking him questions from upstairs, and he's just,  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Okay, just go to bed now.  And, like, he just knows his life is over.  He's done.  Yeah.  That's the great example when they walk into the hotel room. 
[00:50:00]  He's like, Yeah, just a minute.  Yeah.  And the cops bust the door open, and he's trying to climb out the window in his underwear.  No!  No!  There's some ass on instant feedback.  Just a ton of Zs and a snore, and then more Zs.  Oh, then just leave.  If that dude is still listening, then you know what?  This show ain't for you.  Just go listen to, I don't know.  By the way, I Z at the Z email.  Like, it's so hack for a friggin' instant feedback to put the Zs.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  You're doing a hack Z thing.  We're running late.  Let's say hi to Richard in St. Louis.  Richard, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Opie?  Hey.  I got an example of responsible radio for you.  Yeah.  I was listening to Man Cow in a small Missouri town while y'all were on vacation.  He had on the director of Beer Fest.  And they started telling the guy how irresponsible it was to be showing binge drinking to college students.  It was riveting.  The guy just has lost his mind.  Once again, Chicago, I'm really sorry. 
[00:51:00]  I'm really sorry the old Man Cow was taken away from you by the new Man Cow.  What a douche.  Who is that guy?  What a douche.  He let everybody down in Chicago.  That's a fact.  And his type of radio will not catch on.  It will not catch on in America.  I don't even know what it is.  His type of radio.  What's the organization again?  The, uh...  What?  Foundation for Responsible Radio dot com. 
[00:51:30]  Wonderful.  All right.  We'll, uh...  We'll step aside.  Yeah, Fargo.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  There's a whole Fargo thing going on there.  Yeah.  Of course, yeah.  He's fleeing the interview.  Love that movie.  Maybe that's where that whole bunny thing comes from.  Yeah, it kind of is like a William H. Macy thing.  I love Fargo.  He thinks that whole plan is going to work out.  Yeah.  Oh, that's my deal.  Come on, Wade.  But you just can't even go to, like, uh... 
[00:52:00]  You just have some great numbers.  You can't even go to the local store without all eyes looking at you going,  I know they know.  I know.  Oh, my God.  When is it going to happen?  When are they going to arrest me?  When he loses his mind for that little short little burst in his office at the car dealership.  I got to watch that now again.  It starts, like, just breaking things.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll pick them at.  John and Jeff, the muffler?  We have to.  Not the muffler.  Not the muffler.  And then one of our callers got in to say that Opie and Anthony are talking about you. 
[00:52:30]  And then, of course, because they're nice and responsible, they thought it was great.  I wouldn't do anything else.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Irresponsible radio at its best. 
[00:53:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Good morning, Chicago.  Good morning to you.  Hey, before we take the next break, somebody, just somebody in this room remind us that we have to play Pamela's version of the sign.  The whole version.  That's rough because you're like we just came out of a break.  So we can't do a lockdown.  Just focus, though.  Just focus.  All right.  The listeners are begging for this today.  Full version.  Oh, he's on the swing.  I believe it's up on Opie and Anthony.com, but it'll give you a chuckle. 
[00:53:30]  Also on the way, Dick Cheney losing it on CNN.  Again, John Kerry getting a little choked up.  A little misty-eyed, huh?  But they keep pulling us in.  We've got to go back to the John and Jeff thing.  We have to.  I hate these guys.  They're supposed to make this show.  What are these promos they keep giving us?  They're not representative of the show.  Not at all.  No.  Well, for the rest of America, we pulled the John and Jeff bit of the day. 
[00:54:00]  This is the show that is on before us.  That's really going to help us with the ratings, I've got to tell you.  Great lead-in.  Thanks for the lead-in, fellas.  Just like Friends or Seinfeld.  Great lead-in.  Thanks.  Yeah.  It's just like having American Idol as your lead-in before you talk to the entire country.  Before your State of the Union.  Right.  It's the same exact thing that's going on here.  But I'd rather listen to mating nursing sharks.  A little more entertaining. 
[00:54:30]  Because some of the countries, they're bitching.  They're like, look, we have no idea because we don't have John and Jeff on in our market.  Well, don't you worry.  E-Rock has a new job.  His job is to get the John and Jeff bit of the day.  How can he screw that up?  And today's bit was them talking, according to E-Rock, for three hours about mufflers?  About mufflers and muscle cars.  And muscle cars.  So we got just a little taste.  Just a little taste of John and Jeff.  And trust me, this is leading to a big laugh.  Well, last night, Jeff and I had dinner with our agent, our business agent. 
[00:55:00]  And it was an early dinner.  And I decided...  By the way, guess who represents them?  Don't say it.  I swear to God.  The same guy that represents us.  Our agent, of course.  Will you get rid of these hack radio shows and focus on us, you dummy?  What a dummy.  Well, last night, Jeff and I had dinner with our agent, our business agent. 
[00:55:30]  Wow, what a bore fest that must have been.  Holy Jesus.  I'll get there on time.  And all of a sudden, I hear...  Someone sexy walked by?  Were you growling with Steve in the room with you?  Young little Asian busboy.  When a man makes that noise, it sounds very manly.  Yeah.  How do you mess that up?  This ain't it.  And I heard...  And I'm like, wait a minute. 
[00:56:00]  That's got to be Jeff.  And I start looking around.  I'm at a stoplight.  Just a power bottom.  Yeah.  I have no idea, but...  Sloppy party bottom.  Looking around.  I'm at a stoplight.  And about 20 seconds later, Jeff's car passes in front of me.  That means I heard Jeff's car a half a mile away at an intersection. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, Jeff, this is getting to the point where you are not doing your part for the environment.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, I mean...  All right.  Wow.  All right.  The whole thing's a joke.  The whole show has got to be a goof on this type of radio.  Remember, it's L.A.  And they are...  They are geniuses.  And they're goofing on this type of radio because no one actually goes, no.  Oh, no.  Stop.  Right?  It's a joke, right? 
[00:57:00]  Come on.  Someone let me in on this.  If it was out of New York, I'd say yes, but it's out of L.A.  No.  That's who they are.  No, Jeff.  I think the question was, do you like vaginas?  No.  Ew.  Not doing your part for the environment.  Oh, no.  No.  I mean...  Oh, come on.  If I can...  Jeff, if I can hear your car a half a mile away, your neighbors must hate your guts. 
[00:57:30]  And the reason you drive it is because you want people to look at you when you're driving.  It's almost like when a woman gets breast implants.  It's a woman gets breast implants for attention.  There's a hard time talking about this.  Jeff drives his muscle car for the same sort of attention.  You know, John, some guys are into wine.  They love a nice glass of wine.  Some guys are a connoisseur of beer.  I love...  ...premium...  Thank you. 
[00:58:00]  So glad you got that.  Gotta explain, man.  Anthony added that beep right at the perfect time.  At the perfect time.  I love...  Yes, I bet you do.  No man says they're a connoisseur of beer.  Are you...  Some people are into wine.  Don't you say you're a beer drinker?  Yeah.  No one is an actual connoisseur.  Connoisseur.  They might like trying out different beers, but they would never use the term connoisseur. 
[00:58:30]  You know who's like a...  There's one connoisseur of beer.  Jim Cook.  Yeah, there you go.  His whole life is beer.  Right.  That's it.  They love a nice glass of wine.  Some guys are a connoisseur of beer.  I love premium exhaust.  I love the sound.  I believe that you seek out attention from strangers with the car that you drive.  You are like a woman with breast implants.  That's really what you're all about. 
[00:59:00]  Listen, some guys will drive a Corvette when they reach 50 in order to get attention, but  they're 50 and they're trying to get someone who's 18 or 19 to jump in the car.  But Jeff, you're already married, so why would you want to drive a loud car?  I mean, you're faithful to your wife, so now you have all these women checking you out  and then you're teasing them.  I mean, I don't understand.  Yeah, I don't either.  Good little remark there. 
[00:59:30]  I don't understand.  If Mancow has it his way, this is what you would get to hear.  That is responsible radio.  Boring, boring, boring, boring.  The Foundation for Responsible Radio doesn't even have to look at those people.  Right.  I want those guys on a loop.  It's all I want to listen to.  Be careful, John.  That's going to be the next promo.  Yeah, John Minnelli's going to make it into the next promo.  If you weren't listening about a half hour ago, we trash these guys every day. 
[01:00:00]  We can't get enough of this, right?  And we say horrific things.  And John Minnelli, he calls me up and goes,  I'm going to use some of the stuff you guys are saying about this show to make a promo.  And I'm thinking, brilliant.  He's thinking out of the box.  He's going to actually just have a promo where we completely trash him.  And that alone will get people to actually listen.  Get people to listen.  Because even there are people out there that will listen to stuff they hate.  The awful shows.  Right.  But then John Minnelli let us all down.  And he took what we said and made it sound like a real endorsement.  Once again, here's the promo.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  And then we fight back after the promo.  Late nights, 286A.  It's the John and Jeff Show.  Now endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  It's two guys out of L.A.  And they're nice.  I enjoyed the program.  Oh, God.  They're terrific.  John and Jeff.  It's what they call the spice of life.  I get it.  Very nice.  John and Jeff.  Just very sweet.  Qualified to give people advice.  Yeah, absolutely.  There are some mornings I cannot turn that off.  It's so funny.  John and Jeff.  It's so funny.  Late nights, 2 to 6.  Funny.  Now, O&A approved.  You gotta listen. 
[01:01:00]  92.3 Free FM.  Look, man.  I would say less than 1% of the people that are listening to that promo.  Yeah.  Believe that it's a goof.  Would take that as the joke that it's supposed to be.  I would say well over 99% of the people are going,  Wow, this show has to be good.  Opie and Anthony like this show.  Endorsing it.  John Minnelli let us down.  He wimped out.  So, you know, we didn't.  Take it into our own hands is what we do, my friend.  Good old Steve and Dirk and the gang.  Yep.  They made the promo that should have been made. 
[01:01:30]  That should be playing on this station when we're not here.  It's a little different.  Free FM.  Late nights, 2A to 6A.  It's the John and Jeff Show.  Browned upon by Opie and Anthony.  One of them sounds kind of gay.  And the other one visits Thailand.  John and Jeff just stink.  In my opinion, they sound like fruits.  People that go to Thailand are kid touchers.  They're awful.  If there is a gay sound, that is it.  It's crap, John and Jeff.  It's crap.  Late nights, 2 to 6, when the rest of the world is sleeping. 
[01:02:00]  Now that hits it.  John Minnelli, let's see what you're made of.  It's done and ready to go.  Put it in rotation.  Put this in rotation.  That's the one we want playing.  And get the other one out of rotation.  That promo is O&A approved.  Absolutely.  So then, this will be it for today.  Until next time.  We'll try to rest this for a while. 
[01:02:30]  But one of our callers got into John and Jeff this morning.  All right.  Yeah.  They called John and Jeff.  Whatever.  War.  Steve.  Can I say one more thing?  Very quickly.  We're very late here.  The people that come on after you in New York, I'm not going to say their names because I don't want to give them any advertisement.  Boy, they talk big trash, you guys, and I just, I crack up because the more you talk bad about somebody, the more people want to hear.  Well. 
[01:03:00]  What happened?  Uh-oh.  E-Rock screwed up.  Yeah, we want the part where they actually, uh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Complete tool.  What happened?  I guess it what?  You guess it cut off.  Either that or we're all in depth together.  How about on mic there, E-Rock?  Your answer is I guess it cut off.  I burnt it.  I don't know what happened to it, but I have it right here if you want to.  Can you burn yourself?  You're John and Jeff as one.  All right.  Here.  Let's play it again. 
[01:03:30]  Steve.  Can I say one more thing?  Very quickly.  We're very late here.  The people that come on after you in New York, I'm not going to say their names because I don't want to give them any advertisement.  Boy, they talk, they trash you guys, and I just, I crack up because the more you talk bad about somebody, the more people want to hear it.  So I'm sure they're promoting you guys very well.  Well, Opie and Anthony, we're happy to be the opening act for their show in New York, and hey, it's all good.  So, Steve, thank you very much for the call.  We appreciate it.  Yeah, rock on.  All right.  Have a good night. 
[01:04:00]  I hate radio.  They're so nice.  They are too nice for their own good.  Wow.  We have to fight back at this point.  We've said horrific things about you boys.  We're bullies.  How about this?  I'm going to rape John and Jeff.  All right.  Well, listen.  We go to break with a little sing-along for everybody.  The listeners are loving this.  We've got to play this.  Who reminded you?  Uh, Than. 
[01:04:30]  Than.  Thank you, Than, because I completely forgot.  Than gets a few gold stars today.  Oh.  Yeah.  Look, Danny's all mad.  He's not getting any.  We had a karaoke contest, blah, blah, blah, for a MacBook, and Pamela Hartman won.  She did I Saw the Sign.  How could she not win?  If you're a new listener, you haven't heard this yet.  If you're an old listener, you've only heard a snippet.  Yep.  We finally got the entire version.  It's only like three minutes long.  Let me tell you, though.  It's three minutes long? 
[01:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  The rest of your day will be consumed by singing this song like she did.  Yeah.  That's what I did yesterday.  We played it over at XM.  I left.  I could do nothing but sing the song the same way she does.  It's all the swings.  So this is Pamela as we go to break.  Yeah.  I Saw the Sign.  But listen closely.  Extended version.  Extended version.  It will be stuck in your head today.  I Saw it. 
[01:05:30]  What'd you see?  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I got a new life. 
[01:06:00]  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm a new person.  I hear it.  I hear it.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[01:06:30]  That's all the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light.  Where you belong.  I feel to you belong.  I get a new game.  There's any views of one to who you are.  I'm too person like you.  I'm a real joy. 
[01:07:00]  I'm in a pale moon.  Where I see a lot of stars.  And I've been up.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light.  Where you belong. 
[01:07:30]  But where do you belong?  Oh, oh, oh.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  And I am happy not living without you.  I love you. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light.  Where you belong.  The sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[01:08:30]  I saw the sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Virus  Come on  She's naked  Me and Steve are having a quick conversation  About what she might be doing in the bathroom  And you turn the mics on  And I didn't have the headphones on  I started laughing because it was really disgusting  I try to do that to you all the time 
[01:09:00]  I know, catch me in mid-sentence  You're on to me finally  Steve had an awful thought and I elaborated on it  And we laughed  Girl across the way is naked this morning  Was she on her exercise bike?  She did the bike, she's got a routine  So she did the exercise bike  And then she stands on her head for a few minutes  With her sweatpants on  What is that supposed to accomplish?  I don't know  I've heard it's actually recycling the blood  Getting the blood to go backwards  It's supposed to be really good for you 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, well  Then she takes her clothes off  And kind of walks around her room a little bit  Which is the big picture window  And then walks into the bathroom  So Steve was assuming she was doing something  Other than showering  Or brushing her teeth  Doing some type of biological function  And really wrecking the joint  That's the illusion we have  Steve, taking the sexiness out of her  Of course  You think the headstand is to stir things up? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah  Get them moving?  After that exercise bike?  Yeah, it's probably  You know, do the headstand  Compact it the other way a little bit  She loves this though, man  No curtains or shades  Nothing  No, not a curtain  New to the world  Facing a building  Facing a building  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show  We get paid to do this  Yes, I understand  Yeah  I'm sorry  I'm very sorry  We're not responsible  Phone numbers 1-866-313-FREE  Still lots to do  Ian Bernardo 
[01:10:30]  People are talking about Ian Bernardo today  He's from New York  He was the first dude on American Idol last night  We'll get into that in a little while, I guess  And I'm hearing rumors that he's from my old college, Geneseo  The gay guy?  The gay guy's from Geneseo?  He went to Geneseo?  Oh, God  Saying the gay guy on American Idol is a little  True  True  90% of the guys that go on that show  During the audition process  I'd like to sing Somewhere Over the Rainbow 
[01:11:00]  Well, guys like Ian Bernardo  They're going to wreck American Idol  See, the reason William Hung works so well  The guy really thought he had what it takes to be the next American Idol  And then he became a star for the goof factor  And for his awful singing  So now, every year, they really, really focus on the awful singers  But now people are going in knowing that  So they're trying to really play it over the top  It's another way of winning American Idol  Right  If you don't even make it past the first step there 
[01:11:30]  As long as you've made yourself a complete tool  That people talk about the next day  You're kind of a celebrity  Yeah  So you kind of cut the corner there  You don't have to go through the whole show  And you still have some kind of celebrity status  It's like with any reality show, though  They always, initially, they have the right idea  And they film people kind of acting natural  And then after a while, during the casting process 
[01:12:00]  People understand what the producers of the show want  So that's what they give them  And it becomes something totally different  I was watching, not even watching  I saw like a commercial for the real world  That is a completely different entity than it was  Oh, absolutely  When it first started  It was just, you know, pretty much average people  Average 20-year-olds in a house  They throw them in there and see how they interact  A little social experiment  And now it's just this big  It's like the friggin' OC  They're all, every episode 
[01:12:30]  It's just, oh, this one's making out with that one  In the hot tub  It's an episode of the OC  It's nothing anymore about the real world  Or people interacting  Back in the day, these reality shows really worked  Because you didn't really believe  That the show was going to really catch on with everybody  You know, you knew the cameras were there  But you're like, who's really going to see this crap?  And that's why it got some real reality moments  But now everyone's playing to the camera  They know what has worked in the past  So they're going down that same road 
[01:13:00]  Remember Puck?  Remember Puck?  From San Francisco's real world  He was a complete ass  Complete tool  But it was pretty much authentic  That's like how the guy was  He was just an ass to everybody  And then you noticed after him  He kind of set like the benchmark  And then there had to be the jackass in the house  You know?  So people would go in there  Acting like that  And it didn't come off as sincere or real or anything 
[01:13:30]  So  Well, I'm looking at a scene  It's stink now  Hey man, it's really hot  You got two girls in a hot tub  Completely making out  Where?  But they're doing it for the cameras  And doing it for their own exposure  Oh, yeah  See, it's like  Alright  I mean, there's nothing wrong  That's going to get people watching  But why not just call it  Two girls in a hot tub  And just play it  Right  It's not the real world  It's  Like that's what they're looking for  So that's what they give them  It's no more  Let's put the cameras in  And see what they do  It's let's put the cameras in  And kind of tell these people 
[01:14:00]  What we want  Right  That's not natural  People aren't going to just do that  They probably hint and go  Look, if you're not doing anything  Really crazy or outrageous  You're not going to get a lot of TV time  Not going to get a lot of time  We edit out a lot of stuff here  So you guys  Remember, the cameras are rolling  24 hours a day, you know  Most of this stuff is going to be  On the editing floor  People want to see things like  You know, maybe some making out  In the hot tub  Things like that  Okay  Make out in the hot tub, girls  It's not even sexy  It's cornball played for television  Yeah  It doesn't come off as real 
[01:14:30]  It doesn't look like a grain silo  With a strap on it  If you're not  Then don't waste my time  I used to be a huge real world fan  I haven't watched in  I don't even know which one  Years  The last one I watched  Many, many years  But getting back to Ian Bernardo  So he's playing it up  Trying to be the next William Hung  That's what's going on here  And it's not legit  He knows he's an awful singer  And he also plays it like  What do you mean I'm an awful singer  Yeah, hey  Don't put me down  Ian, you know you're an awful singer 
[01:15:00]  You look like a complete phony  On that show last night  Yeah, he was acting  This is him introducing himself  To the judges  Acting  Hi, how you been?  Hello  Hello, how are you?  Good  How are you?  What's your name?  My name is Ian Bernardo  That's my name  How old are you?  I am 25 years old, Mr. Cowell  All right  And why are you here in?  To try out for American Idol  Yeah, I know that  Hey, good  That's the whole  Like, why else would I be 
[01:15:30]  The American Idol  I'm here to be  The next American Idol  I thought that it would be  A nice addition  To my already long  And impressive resume  Which is?  Which is superstar  Dancer  Singer  And this is chinchilla  And I'm wearing it  Specifically to  Show the world  How wealthy I can be  Well, you're not a superstar  But you are a singer  Because I am a superstar  Now, with respect to Ian  You're not a superstar  But you may be a singer  And a dancer  I am a singer  I'm a dancer  And I am a superstar  You can ask my family  You can ask my friend  You can ask one of my therapists  I am 
[01:16:00]  One of them  How many therapists do you have?  I have two  All right  Okay  What are you going to say?  All right  Okay  Yeah, like  And here's the deal  What they're looking for  Sounds just disgusted by it  I think it's pretty obvious  To everybody  But before you go  In front of those guys  You're going in front  Of a bunch of other people  And they're looking  For two simple things  Real talent  And real goof factors  Yeah  And then these guys  Make believe  That a guy like Ian  Actually could win  The whole thing  It's like  Why don't you tell us  We're not dumb  Tell us  Look 
[01:16:30]  We're now going to show you  Some really dopey people  For a while  And they're all  The three of them there  Are all briefed  On who walks in that door  They already know  That this is a goof  Of course  A goof audition  Coming up  They know what to ask them  To get the answers they want  Because they've been briefed  Right  And the people have been  Pre-interviewed  Before they go in  By producers  There's no spontaneity  To this show  And it's getting worse  Every year with that  Like you see more 
[01:17:00]  Of the stupid people acting  And they're going to ruin it  They've got to be really careful  So this is Ian singing Gloria  And you know  He's making believe  That this would actually  Get the job done  And this is what annoyed  The hell out of me last night  Gloria  You're always on the run now  Running after somebody  You're going to get them somehow  I think you've got to slow down  Before you start to blow it  I think you're headed  For a breakdown  So be careful  Not to show it  You really don't remember  Was it something that he said  Are the voices in your head 
[01:17:30]  Calling Gloria  Gloria  Don't you think you're falling  If everybody wants you  Why isn't anybody falling  I'm going to punch this idiot  In the face  You don't have to answer  Leave him hanging on the line  Hey, hey, hey  Calling Gloria  Gloria  How are you going to go down  Will you meet him on the main line  Or will you catch him on the rebound  Will you marry for him  Okay  See, he's just trying to do a William Hung  He knows William Hung is making  A really nice living right now  It's so fake  I like the fact that  When they talk to the therapist 
[01:18:00]  Simon, okay  Like, I'm not going to play into  Your corn  Right, right  Questions  Right  Like, you're supposed to go  How many do you have  One of my therapists  Oh, intriguing young man  Yeah  Yeah  Well  Who cares  Of course the judges  Wow, big surprise  They  They hate it  They hate his performance  And have to tell him  Randy  And then he has to act surprised  Oh, God, dude  I don't even know what to say  Thank you  Didn't mean it that way  Three syllables  Hollywood

[01:21:00]  Goat allegedly sexually assaulted  Allegedly  Bestiality  At it's finest here, folks  Very sad story  And you want to take this one?  D. Thompson Poirier  Some French name  Animal control officer  In Okaloosa County  Oh, one of man-cow's big markets  Right by Mossy Head, Florida  As a matter of fact  Says in her 20 years  In this profession 
[01:21:30]  She has never seen anything like it  A goat  Allegedly sexually assaulted  At the hands of a human  We took it to the vet  And no doubt in her mind  The goat had been sexually molested  So the vet, I guess  The expert there  Checked and said  It had been  This bizarre and disturbing case  Began over the weekend  When the owner of the goat  In Mossy Head, Florida  Called to say  Her female goat was dead  And it appeared suspicious  Thompson Poirier 
[01:22:00]  What made it suspicious, by the way?  There's a ribbon in the goat's hair  Pornographic magazines near it  We just don't give you enough detail  In these stories  What made it suspicious?  It probably  If you saw it  I bet you would be like  That looks suspicious  You know?  All right, right  Like I've seen dead goats  Growing up and stuff  Out in California  And they didn't look suspicious at all  It was just like 
[01:22:30]  Ah, the goat died  Yeah  Or something  That probably looked  And you went  Oh yeah  That goat's been molested  Yeah  They found the goat  With a blindfold  Handcuffed to a king bed  Oh, apparently  Yeah  The goat's dress  Was hiked up around its waist  Most provocatively  They had to use a rape kit  Yeah  They took DNA samples  Took DNA samples  They were sent out to the lab  Officials said 
[01:23:00]  There are several reasons  Why they believe a human  Did this first  Because of the injuries  To the animal  Also  There were no male goats  On the property at all  Finally, the goat is pregnant  By a goat  Meaning the goat  Was not in heat  So  If there was a male goat around  It wouldn't have been able  To do that  Because  You know  She wasn't in heat  So they turn around  And kind of  You know  Headbutt it  Male goats have self-control?  Who knew?  No, male goats don't  But the female goat  Will like  Turn around 
[01:23:30]  And smack them  Okay  Smack them in the head  All right  In our investigation  This is something  They've been dealing with  And have not  Had much success  In prosecuting  For several years  Wow  They've  Something they've been  Dealing with  They've dealt with this before  Is that what they're  Trying to say?  This sort of assault  May have been going on  For years  And there may be  Other goats  Which have been victims  In the mossy head area  Oh no  He's a serial goat rapist  Serial goat raper  Serial goat rapist 
[01:24:00]  On the loose  Are they asking him  To come forward?  The suspect's name  Has not been released  Because he's not  Been charged  Officials are awaiting  Results of the DNA test  The animal control  Officer in Florida  It's not a crime  To commit a sex act  With an animal  But it's a felony  To torture or kill them  While no exact  Cause of death  Has yet been  Determined  The vet believes  The goat may have died  Of a stress related  Heart attack  Oh my god 
[01:24:30]  And that would make  This a felony crime  Yeah wow  Poor little thing  Poor little thing  Poor guy  Poor guy  Hanging onto a dead goat  Just trying to wrap  Things up quickly  Oh yeah  What if that happened  That's necrophilia  Bestiality  Goat gets too heavy  You have to fall down  To the dirt with it  Oh what a horrid scene 
[01:25:00]  Oh the goat's dead  Oh back to the body suit  I just wanted to  Do something  I've thought about  Just experimenting  With a goat  Now it's dead  DNA oh  He's reading about it  In the paper  Oh it's just a matter  Of time  They're gonna get me  He probably thought  He figured it out  Perfectly  There was no one around  No one's there  And now he's  Gonna happen  He's stuck under the goat  That died of a heart attack  Trying to figure out  How he's gonna  Get himself free 
[01:25:30]  And how do you leave  The goat  In some kind of  Suspicious way  Where it looks like  It's been assaulted sexually  Just like that scene  In Caddyshack  Yeah  You just drop the clubs  And you kind of  Just saunter off  Yeah see  But he should have  Done something to the goat  Where they would just be like  Oh the goat died  Or make it look like  Some kind of satanic ritual  Ah  Or something  You chop its head off  You do something like that  You make that  A pentagram 
[01:26:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  In its own goat blood  Yeah yeah  Yeah perfect  Like that perfect  And then the last thing  They'd be thinking is  Was it sexually assaulted  Maybe when they found the goat  It was just probably  Looking over its shoulder  And the look on its face  Just gave it away  This can only be one thing  One thing  It was completely frozen  In the moment  A non-goat  Was raping it  Well  Godspeed to the goat  And the gentleman  Who's charged  All right  Felony  Not a felony for the sex 
[01:26:30]  No  Felony because it died  No you're allowed to have sex  With animals in Florida  According to this story  Or at least in that county  It's not a felony  All right  Really fast  Dick Cheney  On Wolf Blitzer  You guys hear this audio yet?  Wolf Blitzer  I haven't heard it  I heard he got a little annoyed  I've never seen Dick Cheney happy  In all these years  Well  He's been in office  With the president there  Angry  He just  He looks like a grump  He just kind of sits there  He's grumpy all the time  And yeah 
[01:27:00]  I noticed  You brought this up yesterday  That he was popping something  During the State of the Union  Pop something in his mouth  Trying to keep that heart going  I guess  Maybe a little nitroglycerin  Or something  And well  He was on CNN  And he doesn't take any crap  From anybody  I do like that about him  No guff  And he  Well he's got the lesbian daughter  And she's now pregnant  Who doesn't know that  And it's such a sensational thing  To bring it up  Like why  Why did Wolf Blitzer  Even bring it up? 
[01:27:30]  I'm not a Wolf Blitzer fan  But I gotta say  When you're  In the administration  Making decisions  That affect people's lives  Yeah  And you're constantly  Railing against gays  And they can't do this  And you got a gay daughter  I think it's fair  To bring you to task  On a personal issue  Yeah why not  I don't think Cheney  Has really spoken out  On the issue though  You should  It's uh  He has said  He's proud of her  But I don't think  He's gonna use her  As like this  Poster child for  But he's part  Of the administration  To get back  At his administration  He's part of the administration 
[01:28:00]  That's against gay marriage though  Completely  Not just kind of indifferent  But like really against it  It's like you know  It's kind of phony  It's yeah  They don't even want  To tiptoe into the gray area  They're like  F that  And his own daughter  Is gay in a relationship  And gonna have a baby  Aw that's great  So uh  Good old uh  Wolf Blitzer  Asked uh  The vice president  And he wasn't gonna  Have any of it  We're out of time  But a couple uh  Issues I want to raise  With you  See this  Right at the end  These mothers  This is what they do  By the way  Yeah 
[01:28:30]  We've been part  Of this crap  I've asked you  Everything I want  To ask you  Uh got all the answers  It was very nice  And cordial  Now I'm gonna  Piss you off  And chase you  Out of here  And um  I now want to  Ask you the question  I should have  Asked from the beginning  Now comes the sound bite  Right  But I had to uh  You know  Fill about ten minutes  Of my show  So it was the  Blah blah portion  But this is what  I really wanted  To talk about  We're out of time  But a couple  Issues I want to  Raise with you  Uh  Your daughter Mary  She's pregnant  All of us are happy  She's gonna have a baby  You're gonna have  Another grandchild  Some of the uh 
[01:29:00]  Some critics though  Are suggesting  For example  A statement from  Alright who are the critics  Some  This is the news crap  Some people are saying  Some critics  Some critics  Who  Are suggesting  And you know  Same names  You know Dick Cheney  Was just like right  When he said  Your daughter is pregnant  He just went like  Oh here it comes  Right  Oh this wolf  She's so pregnant  And such a dyke  Such a mullet  That critic 
[01:29:30]  Wolf Blitzer  Wolf Blitzer  But he's not brave  Enough to say  Critics are saying  By critics I mean me  I was noticing  In the  Yeah  In the paper  That this is going on  And this seems  A little hypocritical  But I  I'm not brave enough  To actually say  That I'm saying this  So  It's a critic  Some nameless  Faceless critic  Right  Are suggesting  For example  A statement from  Someone representing  Focus on the family  Someone  Mary Cheney's  Pregnancy  Raises the question  Of what's best  For children  Just because  It's possible  To conceive a child  Outside of the 
[01:30:00]  Relationship of a  Married mother and  Father  Doesn't mean  It's best  For the child  Do you want to  Respond to that  No I don't  She's  Obviously a good daughter  I'm delighted  I'm about to have  A sixth grandchild  Wolf  And  Obviously  Think the world  Of both my  Daughters  And all of my  Grandchildren  And I think  Frankly you're  Out of line  With that question  I think  I think all of us  Appreciate 
[01:30:30]  Your daughter  We like your  Daughters  Believe me  I'm very  Very sympathetic  To Liz  And to Mary  I like them  Both  That was just  A question  That's come up  And it's a  Responsible  Fair question  I  Fundamentally  Disagree  With your  I want to  Congratulate you  On having  Another grandchild  Let's wind up  On a soft note  Nancy Pelosi  What was it like  Sitting  Wow  What a  What a wimp  Wolf Blitzer is  I'll tell you this  Vice president  It's kind of  Yeah it's a little  Intimidating  I'll tell you this  Much 
[01:31:00]  Yeah but I'll tell you  This much about  The vice president  If he didn't have  The bad ticker  I have no doubt  In my mind  He would like  Attack Wolf Blitzer  On TV  Yeah a little more  And try to choke him out  Or something  Absolutely  He seems like  That type of guy  But he just can't  Do that physical  Crap anymore  Bastard  He would go right at him  Shoot him in the face  With a shotgun  Yeah  It's too bad  He doesn't have  A good heart  Because he would  He would attack  He would physically  Attack a guy  For saying that  We're doomed  As a society  By the way  I just looked up 
[01:31:30]  At what apparently  Is supposed to be  The news  Yeah  There is a parrot  Yeah  Playing golf  Yeah well  I just leave it at that  And more soldiers  Are dying in Iraq  But this is  What we need  In the news  Because this is  So important  There's a war on  There's plenty  Of news  That can be covered  During that  Period of time  That that news  Is on  And I looked up  And there was  A parrot  With a putter  In its mouth  On a tiny  Little green 
[01:32:00]  And he was  Moving his little  Head  And hitting the ball  Trying to get it  Into the cup  I think he's  I think he's  Kind of like  A minor  YouTube celebrity  I think he plays  Basketball too  Or something  Is that what he is  He's just an  Athletic little bird  I don't watch  YouTube  For parrots  No  Playing golf  No  Girls making out  Girls kissing  No  I've gone  Right now  I've skipped  Completely  To porno tube  I've just gone

[01:45:30]  And then when a pedestrian  Would approach  They'd go at it  Right up until about  You know  A few yards away  And then they'd  Kind of stop  Like as if they're  Just having conversations  Hanging out talking  And the person would  It was always fun  To watch the person walking  Because there was a bit  Of a  That moment they realized  What was happening  But chose to ignore it  Already a little  Maybe a little bit  Past the situation  Exactly  And then they'd get by  And then stop  And look back  New York is an odd place  For stuff like that  Like if  Other places  If it happened  It'd be just  What are you doing  New York is just  Kind of 
[01:46:00]  Hey  Take a look  Yeah  Exactly  Well that's what's  Move along  That's what's great  About waking up  When we do  For a while there  I was walking to work  And I would see  The cars just all  Steamed up  Because it was that  The time of the morning  Where the clubs  Could let out  And people are  Having sex  In their cars  I used to keep track  But now I get  Driven to work  Unfortunately  So I'm missing out  On that  You'd hear the music  Coming from the car  And just the  Steamed up windows  Yeah  Yeah when we come in  It's still last night  Like you've been  Doing the talk shows  You know  And morning radio  Is like last night 
[01:46:30]  They talk about  When I drive in  I listen to the news  And they're going  The temperature is  34 degrees  Going down to 32  It's like  It's not even as cold  As it's going to get yet  And you're just like  It's still night time  When you come in  Early guy  Do you do that  Or you just like  Sleep late  Hollywood kind of  Now I've got kids  So that kind of  Makes you a morning guy  Well there's this thing  Of like  You know  You realize  You want to wake up  Like an hour before  The kids wake up  Just so you can  You know  I'm ready  I'm ready  For the day 
[01:47:00]  How old  Are these guys  How old are your kids  It's a nice thing  To wake up with them  Because they're so  Demanding  Kids will do that  Right  I don't  I don't have any  No  No  No  No  See you're  Not thinking  How old are your kids  The  Seven and a half  And the youngest  Three and a half  There's three of them  At least  Wow  Too many  At least one too many  Third one's cute though  Well that's a plus  A little extra  I felt  Yeah  I felt it was a little  obnoxious out there. 
[01:47:30]  By the way, there was a lot of controversy. We weren't  sure we were going to have you this morning. There were emails going  back and forth all night long with our  buddy Roland. Did something happen with  Bruce on the set? We're hearing Bruce Willis  got hurt on the set of Die Hard?  I think he had a pet goat.  If that  DNA comes back to Bruce Willis.  It looks suspicious.  From what I've heard, it would just be because  Bruce has been through every woman on Earth  and he had to go to animals.  That's right.  It was very bad or some sort of skydiving thing 
[01:48:00]  that happened. He took a  boot to the head  apparently.  That's what I was told.  He got kicked in the head.  Got some stitches.  He's the kind of guy that could get kicked in the head, get stitches  and it'll just look better on him. He's the real deal.  He's the action guy. He's been very  cool. He's been very nice.  How's it like? Obviously, you were a young  guy when the first movie came out.  The first Die Hard came out.  Yeah. Were you a fan of the movie?  Oh, huge.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, that  I mean, and that still, I think, is one of the great 
[01:48:30]  quintessential popcorn films and  Alan Rickman, one of the great villains.  Oh, what a great, yeah, he was a great one.  Bruce, I was going to, you know, I think I'm just going to do  what Alan Rickman did, but just  more gay.  That's what I'm shooting for on this one.  Hans Gruber.  Right?  I love that one.  My favorite scene in the first one is when he finally bumps into him in the  stairwell and he just, and you're like, oh my, how is this going to play out?  Oh no, you're one of them.  Oh, don't hurt me. 
[01:49:00]  Bruce Willis knew the whole time.  Give him the gun.  Alan Rickman's classic.  Yeah, that was a great villain.  But you, what do you play in the latest installment?  I'm the villain.  You're the bad guy.  You're the bad guy.  Yeah, just more gay.  Like what, what's your, what's your motivation of badness?  Like Alan Rickman, and he was, you know.  I'm just trying not to bring down the franchise.  Not that I feel it rest on my shoulders.  Oh, it does.  You're just kind of trying to do the part.  Look at that. 
[01:49:30]  I don't care what it's about.  Just don't make me the goddamn.  The only thing that helps me is the fall guy.  The Army Irons was the third, it was the villain in the third installment.  And the only thing that helps me a little bit is that I know there's one guy that no  one really remembers that well.  Yeah.  So I feel like that, I got that going for me.  Yeah, yeah.  The, the, the third one wasn't really.  No, no, this is, oh, you didn't like the third?  No, I didn't like the third.  The second one, uh.  I liked the, it was Sam Jackson.  Yeah, that one got a little, a little weird.  Yeah.  And, and, and another thing that ruined that movie for me is living in New York. 
[01:50:00]  Really?  Because you're like, there's no way you can get a cab from Midtown all the way down.  You're one of those guys when you watch the movie.  I wrecked everything.  Oh.  This is unbelievable.  So you had our.  All that other stuff you're believing, but a dumb cab ride.  Yeah, it was the cab ride.  You got a hard time to depart in them too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of ruined a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now you're supposed to also be in, uh, Hitman?  Yeah.  It was, uh, starting March.  You're playing the, the lead role? 
[01:50:30]  The Hitman.  The guy.  I love the, uh, the game.  Played the game.  All I know is the pictures I've seen online.  Yeah.  I looked it up online.  Did you, you haven't played it at all?  First thing you noticed was there's a lot of porn.  Uh, and then I actually got a guy.  Yeah, the black suit, the red tie.  Now, the big thing.  The big thing.  Yes.  The bald head.  The bald head.  Now, we were, we were, we were speculating.  Oh, your wife's gonna hate you?  She thought the mustache was bad.  Could go terribly wrong.  Right.  Yeah.  You could, yeah, what happens?  You know, you, you always wonder.  You shave your head. 
[01:51:00]  You get a little scared.  I have to, I did, uh, an episode of, um, My Name is Earl.  Mm-hmm.  Where they put a bald cap on me.  And I, I have, take some comfort.  And, uh, when we did that, uh, the makeup person telling me, you know, you have a nice  shaped head.  And I.  Oh, that's good.  I've never been told that before.  But when this came up, I said, well, I got that head that's going for me.  So maybe it'll work out.  Maybe the shaved head thing.  Because they can't use like a stupid, an SNL skit, uh, cap on your head. 
[01:51:30]  They got to shave your head.  I think so.  Yeah.  And I don't know what happens if they shave your head and they're like, ooh, that's, it's  bumpy.  Oh, we didn't expect all these bumps.  Yeah.  Oh, we're going to have to find someone else.  I've debated doing it, but I have liver spots on my head.  So I didn't, because I look like I'm a, you know.  Mr. Burns from The Simpsons.  The wig.  Yeah.  No, that's a good call.  Creepy.  You've shaved your head.  Yeah, I've never bald.  I have like little liver spots and it just looks creepy.  I'm in my 30s.  How old are you?  The skull of a 90 year old.  I'm sorry.  Liver spots in your 30s. 
[01:52:00]  That's disgusting.  You have a great personality though.  Thank you.  I mean, that took you a long way.  I said, right, right when you walked in to Timothy, I was saying, don't know him because  we've had celebrities on the phone and stuff.  The one that upset me the most, Edward Norton by on the phone.  Not even that.  He's like, oh, Jimmy Norton, the comedian.  Oh, yeah, I've seen you down there.  And I'm like, son of a bitch.  I just get this like thing where I hate when celebrities know Jimmy.  It's always accidental. 
[01:52:30]  It's always they stumbled on you somewhere.  It's never like they see me as an equal.  We did a project.  It's always something.  Oh, yeah, you're the guy from the comedy.  Believe me, it's nothing.  I wish it was something.  It's never fixed.  Oh, Jimmy, it's more than that.  That's right.  He was on an HBO series.  Lucky Louie.  Do you have to talk about the canceled show?  One of the biggest hits HBO was had in 15 years?  When I first moved out to New York, I did stand-up at Boston.  Comedy Club.  And I did at least a couple nights at Cellar and Louie.  They were like the hosts.  He was here yesterday, Louie.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Cellar's great, boy.  Tough room.  Yeah, Dave Attell.  Yeah, yeah.  All those guys.  You did stand-up?  I did, yeah.  Did you like it?  For a minute.  For a minute?  What didn't you like about it?  It's a tough gig, man.  You know, on one hand, I loved it, and I loved the thrill of it and all.  And at the same time, I felt like, I don't know where I'm going with this.  You know what I mean?  I didn't, the future looked bleak.  Really?  You know, Frank Whaley was doing Stand-up Boy.  You know who he is?  Yeah, no, I did a movie with Frank Whaley.  Yeah.  Frank Whaley's hilarious.  He was in Swimming with Sharks, people don't know.  And here's the guy in Pulp Fiction. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Who was in the Gimp?  Say What Again.  Oh, I thought it was the Gimp.  I wish it was the Gimp.  No, it was the Say What Again.  Yeah.  I did a war movie years ago with Frank Whaley at HBO, and it was miserable.  We were working in Hungary, and we were all miserable, and a bunch of pansy actors wanted  it.  So that's usually what it is.  Just to, you know, I often say, you know, don't be afraid to bitch is the motto for young  actors.  But Frank threatened to quit, and the producer dared him, too. 
[01:54:00]  I remember Frank saying, that's as low as it gets.  When you threaten to quit, and their response is, go ahead, I'd like to see you do it.  I don't think you got the balls to do it.  Oh, you don't have the power.  Yeah, that kind of cuts your power base out from under you right there.  Yeah, that should be it.  That's usually when that's your final, you know, that's your go-to.  How did he go back the next day?  Like, how did he stay facing, oh, you know, I was going to quit, but you wanted me to.  That's exactly right.  That's where he walked back to, all the actors watched this little fight, and it got to the 
[01:54:30]  point where he said he's going to quit.  And he just walked back and just faced it.  He said, you know what?  That just, that sucks, because I'm not going to quit.  He just shouldn't have pulled it out unless he was willing to walk.  That's kind of, he's kind of emasculating.  Yeah, you got to be willing to walk, you know.  How do you go from stand-up to acting?  Took a class.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Took a class, that was pretty much it.  Took a class here in New York.  A man named Bill Esper.  He has some studios here.  What was your first, like, real part? 
[01:55:00]  First part, like, oh, where I got a job done?  Where it was, like, a juicy, nice role.  Well, my first gig was an off-Broadway play here in New York.  First, no, forgive me, I did a TV pilot.  And it was my first acting experience of any kind.  And it was, uh, it was Maria Bello, and it was, um, Jim Caviezel, and myself.  And, uh, it didn't get picked up.  Uh-huh.  They're big stars now.  And we're getting a note.  He's got to go.  He's got to go.  Damn it.  Do you have another interview or something? 
[01:55:30]  I, damn it.  They're handing us notes like crazy.  He's got to leave right now.  Jay Moore.  I used to hang out.  Yeah, we, we, we know Jay.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jay comes on the show or came on the show a while ago.  Now it's too early for him.  He's a big fan of the Ron and Fez show now instead of ours.  But I saw you guys on Dinner for Five, I guess it's called.  And, uh, you guys all sit around and just BS.  I called him.  Yeah.  I was hysterical, man.  Wait, what happened?  That one's hysterical.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, what did it?  I called him a name on the show.  Yeah.  And he's like, you just called me an a-hole in front of, it's like, it's okay. 
[01:56:00]  It's everybody.  Everyone knows this.  People know.  People just know.  They know you are.  The best kept secret.  He's a douche.  Jay, what's the matter with you?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  We, we, uh, yeah.  I remember he was, we did stand up.  Uh, he was, you know, I was just starting doing open mic and stuff.  And then years later, someone said, go.  Yeah.  He was great in that.  All right.  Now we're getting looks.  All right.  I get it.  All right.  We're getting looks.  Well, guys, thank you.  Where do you have to go now? 
[01:56:30]  By the way, you know I'm supposed to be here to promote a movie called Catch and Run.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  Well, the big plug is Catch and Release, right?  Yeah.  I appreciate you saying that.  We, we did it a while back.  And Kevin Smith's in that one.  And she got pregnant.  I just got raped by Kevin Smith playing poker, uh, last week.  Really?  Yeah.  He just destroyed me.  I'm playing again.  What?  February?  February.  Yeah.  I can't leave on that legacy, man.  Good luck with that.  He just, oh, he raked me.  I was just an amateur.  I was giving money away.  Yeah.  I was getting calluses on my knuckles for digging in for more money. 
[01:57:00]  And he's just laughing at me.  Hey, what's the, what's the plug?  What's the movie about really fast?  Catch and Release.  Take your date.  You know, grab a gorilla.  It's a date movie?  It's a good, you know what the, I mean, I'm proud of it.  As romantic comedies go, it really is a, um, you know, head and shoulders above what  you usually see.  It's good.  Uh, Susanna Grant wrote that and directed it.  She wrote Erin Brockovich and she's a real deal.  It's good.  You know, Jennifer Garner's in it.  Do you, were you sexually attracted to your co-star? 
[01:57:30]  Like when you do like a project, do you like-  Gotta go.  Okay.  He really has to go.  So, uh, check out Catch and Release.  Uh, Timothy Oliphant.  Thank you so much for hanging with us today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll be back in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's say hi to John in Midtown.  John, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, John.  Uh, listen, I got something.  I wanted to play, uh, what I learned today.  Oh.  I learned that that whore who was skydiving and the goat had something in common. 
[01:58:00]  They were both asking for it.  That's what you learned today, John.  Very good.  Mind your business.  You take a Viagra, you hear that goat bell tinkling.  What are you supposed to do?  What are you supposed to do?  We'll play a little more of, uh, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony Show in a few  minutes here.  But, uh, American Idol last night, uh, we were going to blow off the rest of the, the clips,  but, uh, I remembered that Jimmy said that he can't really watch some of these people on  American Idol because he can't watch someone's dream get crushed.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Which was a surprise coming from Jimmy because Jimmy could be harsh at times.  At times.  Just at times.  He could be a little mean and a little harsh, but, uh, I like when Jim shows his, uh, soft  side.  Aw.  Which he's always bugged me.  And, uh, I used to attack Simon a lot for that in my stupid act.  I actually like him now, but it was always sickening to me.  Not that he picks on or destroys people, but just people that honestly really just want  to be successful and they suck.  It's like, you feel bad for him, man.  Well.  They're just not good enough.  They have a dream.  It's the only thing they hold on to. 
[01:59:00]  They got a crap job they hate.  They go in there thinking that this is going to be the moment.  They, they probably fantasize about it.  Can't sleep that night.  Just thinking about being the final person on the stage with the other person.  And then you, you win the whole thing and then right at the audition.  No, you're horrible.  Before we move on to XM, I think we can squeeze this in.  I introduce you to Happy Nakia.  Happy Nakia from last night.  I was openly laughing.  I got to be honest.  She's a, she's a, a short, fat, black chick with a lot of energy. 
[01:59:30]  All righty.  It's high energy.  They, they're, they're, they're calling her.  This is Happy Nakia.  My name is Nakia Nicole Claiborne.  People call me Little Shirley because I sound like the legendary Shirley season.  I'm happy.  A lot of energy.  But sometimes you got to keep your composure.  You don't want people to think you're crazy.  I'm trying to keep still there.  I can't help it though. 
[02:00:00]  You want to be an American idol.  You need to have the guts and the gusto to keep on going.  You know, you can't quit.  I have a good feeling about this thing.  I think it's going to work out good.  I'm excited.  Let's see if they can recognize a star.  What does it feel like to have come all this way to be an American idol?  Oh, unbelievable.  Unbelievable. 
[02:00:30]  I have had fun.  It has been a blast.  That's good.  Yeah.  So can't wait.  Can't wait.  Can't wait.  Okay.  What can't you wait for?  To go to Hollywood.  I know I can't say that.  Well, there's one thing you have to do before you get to Hollywood.  I know.  I've got to say it.  So let's do it.  All right.  Before we move on, it's very, very important that you remember how happy she was.  She is ecstatic.  Just remember.  Who's the other girl?  Huh?  Oh, Carol.  There's someone else. 
[02:01:00]  Carol Sager.  The legendary Carol Sager.  Legendary?  Yeah.  She wrote all those a million hit songs that other people sang.  Really?  With Burt Bacharach.  Burt Bacharach.  She did some songs with Burt Bacharach.  Did she do anything with Engelbert Humperdinck?  No, just Burt Bacharach.  Hump Between the Moon and New York City.  That was her.  Really?  Groovy Kind of Love from Bill Collins.  That was her.  She didn't actually sing these songs.  She sang songs herself, but she's really known for being a writer. 
[02:01:30]  She penned them.  I thought that was Christopher Cross.  That's what.  Who sang that?  What?  Who sang the theme from Arthur?  Yeah, Christopher Cross.  Yeah.  He didn't write that?  No.  Oh, I didn't know that.  He's a notorious dude.  No, I have the songs you don't love.  I did not know that.  Aren't written by the artist.  Not saying that I like a Christopher Cross song, but I'm just talking in general.  Thought he had written that one.  That's what friends are for.  She wrote that with Burt Bacharach.  Burt Bacharach.  And her. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, they were a big team.  So remember how happy Nikhil was, all right?  Sure.  Very key as we move on here.  This is her trying out for American Idol.  I'm going to sing.  I'm dancing in the street by Martha Rees and Evendor.  I love you.  Still happy, full of energy.  Here she goes.  All right.  Are you ready for a brand new beat?  Yeah.  The summer's here and the time is right.  For dancing in the street.  Dancing in Chicago. 
[02:02:30]  Down in New Orleans.  I'm dancing in the city.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Energy.  You're fun, kid.  Lots of fun.  Yeah.  Still happy.  Happy Nikhil.  I was going to ask you, Paula.  What do you think?  Hi, Henry.  Nikhil's got all this energy.  She does.  You're infectious.  It's just infectious.  I love it.  So is Jimmy.  Get him in.  Bring it down. 
[02:03:00]  Down.  Late at night while all the world is sleeping, I stay home and think of you.  And I still can't believe you came up to me and said I love you.  All right.  You get the point.  But I can see why she thinks she can sing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can definitely see she's got some power. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Some range.  The voice has a nice kind of tone to it.  It's not awful.  She's not screeching or anything.  But you've got to be able to stay on key.  You've got to be able to hold a note.  Are you ready to hear someone's dream get crushed?  Here it comes.  Let's remember, happy Nikhil.  High energy.  Happy Nikhil.  Snuff her out.  And, Jimmy, I want to know what you're feeling as we move on here.  Here we go.  The judges sound off.  Paula, what do you think of that? 
[02:04:00]  You need a lot of work with your singing.  A lot of work.  How do you think you did?  Nerds probably got to be on a slow song, but I probably could do another one better.  The problem was that the first song, Dancing in the Streets, was just so much fun.  And the party was going on.  That we didn't care if there were flaws, because you just had us going with you.  The second song, unfortunately, there were so many things that needed. 
[02:04:30]  Your pitch was not there.  All right, so let's sum it up here, Paula.  No, no for me, Kea.  No, no?  No.  You were a joy, though.  No for me either, dear.  But thanks for coming out.  You enjoyed it.  Yeah, sweetheart.  It was definitely entertaining.  Okay, remember when I told you to remember the happy Nikhil, the high energy Nikhil?  Did Simon yes or through?  Huh?  He wasn't even there yet, I don't think.  He was late.  So, uh...  Late?  Here's Nakia trying to change the judges' minds. 
[02:05:00]  I got a lot of people that really want me to go.  I can't let them down.  I got a lot of support.  I know.  You got to tell them that we liked you very much.  You came here and you did your thing.  You worked it out.  It just wasn't great today.  You did really good.  Oh, she's pleading her case.  Yeah.  What is it about my pitch?  I mean, I could change it.  It's off.  It's off.  I mean, but...  I mean, explain to me when you say off.  I mean, what is this?  You're not hitting this.  One note was in tune.  The next note wasn't in tune. 
[02:05:30]  The next note wasn't in tune.  The other note was in tune, kind of.  So, if everything stayed on the same note, then...  No, no, no, no.  Nakia, understand.  We're trying to find the best.  It's not just about finding somebody that sings pretty good.  It's not about that.  Trying to find the best.  It was a very different Nikhil.  Who emerged from the room.  I'm going to say something to the camera.  I can't.  This is not the end.  You go back to Virginia, you're saying.  That's all. 
[02:06:00]  I just wish I could change their mind.  I just wish I could change their mind.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  He said no.  Sometimes you get tired of hearing no.  You get tired of hearing no.  And it's not just for singing.  You just get tired of hearing no. 
[02:06:30]  You're not being fair.  This isn't fair.  Idiot.  Did you see that jerk?  She looks like Fred Berry.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fred Berry.  She's rerun. 
[02:07:00]  There were a bunch of psychos on the show.  I wish I could change their mind.  I wish I could change their mind.  You feel bad.  I think I'm on the ball today.  Whoa, whoa, girl.  See, I know what they're going for, but I don't allow myself to give them what they want.  I'm not going to be the one on the couch with the teary eyeballs because of that.  I refuse to play their game.  This judge's remark, I don't know which one it was, but uncalled for. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  For some reason or another, you sound a little taller on radio.  One of the judges.  So what do you think, Jimmy?  Well, I'm not your laughing, so it don't matter.  That's not that bad.  I feel bad for her, though, because she seems like it.  She really believes, though.  But they didn't trash her.  Like, that's not what I'm talking about. 
[02:08:00]  Because they're like, look, you're just not the best.  Yeah.  They didn't say she sucked.  They didn't rip her apart.  It's like, all right, go.  But she really thought she was in.  She thought she was going to Hollywood when she walked in there.  Yeah.  Because people probably tell her, wow, your voice is great in Virginia, where she's going  back to sing.  You go back and sing in Virginia.  Yeah, that's just like being on American Idol.  As far as Virginia goes, she must sound like Celine Dion.  Oh, she's the best.  I didn't know she was from Virginia.  Yeah, she was like, all right, let's get this over with so I can start celebrating that  I'm going to Hollywood.  Ooh. 
[02:08:30]  Picture herself running out that door with that yellow piece of paper.  I'm going to Hollywood.  I'm going to Hollywood.  What?  No, you're not.  I said her in a fat, smoky Robinson hairdoer going back to Virginia.  Hey, Jimmy, we're not going to see you for a couple days?  No, I'm going to Sacramento.  I'm back on Tuesday.  Tuesday, we'll see you.  Okay.  Sacramento Punchline.  Going for a contest, are you?  Yes.  Sacramento Punchline with Jim Norm.  We've got to get out of here.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:09:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:09:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:10:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:12:30]  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined. 
[02:13:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  Robert Reed. 
[02:13:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Bucksonic.  Ah.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show continues.  I can't listen to the opener anymore.  I just can't listen to it.  Oh, why?  Oh, the model.  Just get me saying anything else, please.  I think that's great. 
[02:14:00]  You got to think that.  Anything but that.  Yeah, that is classic.  Because it wasn't said, it was, it was, it was like, it was repressed, it was something  repressed that was vomited out.  It was just a ragefully spit out.  I started my life.  I got a better model.  I started my life as a very, very smart person.  I did very well in school and then I just got bored with school.  Cool.  And I think deep down I wanted to do anything else but this.  Wanted to walk the runway in a fine blazer. 
[02:14:30]  I don't even know if I wanted a long catwalk.  I think I wanted to think that I could have in some bizarre way.  Ah, see, that would have, you know, I wanted to be a model.  I didn't want to be a model.  It's not, and it's not even I could have been, it's you know I could have been a model.  It's like, here comes some facts.  Here comes some facts.  Facts alert, ladies and gentlemen.  It's not, yeah, it's not even like I could have been a model like, like I could have,  with a little luck or this.  It's like, no, this was a given. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, you know I could have been a model.  It's a given.  Because I think models get.  The offer was in.  I think models get more respect.  I think secretly I wanted to be like an actor in Hollywood, you know, in some big movie.  Because, I mean, yes, we're doing great.  We make a fine living doing this fine radio show.  But the reality is we get absolutely no respect from anybody.  No.  And we're looked at as the scourge of society and all that crap.  We are like fucking pilot fish.  And I think deep down I hate that.  We're like pilot fish. 
[02:15:30]  Like real celebrities are the sharks.  And we're like those little fish that follow them around.  No respect whatsoever, just picking up crumbs.  Yeah, yeah.  But they learn to become afraid of the pilot fish because there's a lot of them.  And they understand that the big shark can be eaten up by a lot of little pilot fish sending emails and fucking pestering them.  Well, that's true.  We do have some bottom feeders, too.  Speaking of sharks.  Oh, wow.  Could be story of the day.  But really fast on the instant feedback, someone from their cell phone. 
[02:16:00]  If you instant feedback off a cell phone, use your name, please.  Because it just gives your number and that's it.  But this guy writes or this girl writes, wow, I didn't know Opie could have been a model.  I am so lucky you chose radio.  See?  There's a happy customer.  Lucky me.  Could have been totally different there, lady.  Could have been watching him walking down a catwalk.  On the catwalk.  On the catwalk.  Speaking of models, Tyra Banks is trying to tell everyone that 5'10", 161 pounds is not fat for a lady. 
[02:16:30]  Why is she defending herself?  Did someone say something?  Besides us?  Well, the controversy.  I don't think she had to answer that.  And now there's a few women out there with their mouth agape.  Agape?  I'm talking in the fantasy world that we men like to live in.  Men.  When we're talking fantasy, 5'10", 161 pounds is fat.  5'10", 161? 
[02:17:00]  It's not fat, but it's not like...  It's not model 5'10".  It's not an ideal woman, I guess, when you're living in that fantasy world that's heaven.  She's getting a sun jump.  She's getting a sun jump.  Basically, the paparazzi got her on vacation in this one-piece.  It was on the front cover of one of these gossip magazines.  What's she wearing a one-piece for?  Can we find the picture?  It was everywhere.  Because not only was it a one-piece, it was an awful one-piece.  And it made her look, you know, not really hot at all.  Dumpy or frumpy? 
[02:17:30]  Both.  Wow.  Can we get someone in here to maybe work?  Where is this little riot going on?  Huh?  Oh, there's a little riot going on on the television.  Students rioting.  Do you know where that picture is, then?  We're all looking for it right now.  Oh, okay, okay.  Because Anthony hasn't seen the picture.  No.  So she was so offended because, you know...  I need that immediately.  Because no one is allowed to say anything bad to Tyra because she just can't handle it.  No.  I think her brain would actually explode if she knew people's real thoughts about her. 
[02:18:00]  Because she's like...  She's surrounded by people that just kiss her ass.  Yes, man.  And see that giant ego and giant forehead of hers.  So she, uh...  Imagine the producers telling her that they want to do another segment where she goes out as a fat person,  but they don't give her the suit.  Yeah.  She shows up to work that day.  I'm here early for makeup.  No, no makeup.  You could just go out now.  Yeah, yeah.  Looking around for the fat suit.  What?  What?  What? 
[02:18:30]  Why?  Oh, my God.  So she had to come out and basically she couldn't help herself and go, does this look fat?  Does this look fat?  I think she's on the front page of People Magazine or something going...  I think that's where this is going.  Does this look fat?  And of course she probably trimmed up a little since the one piece toned up picture was shocked.  I think she looks good.  I mean, when she did that underwear...  Remember the underwear show?  Where she made all the house frowes feel bad? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  She looked unbelievable.  Yeah, she looked great.  The lingerie show.  She been packing it on recently?  Yeah, I guess.  Okay.  I like a fatter dumper, to be honest with you.  Let me show you this picture.  Not on her.  I guarantee you're not going to like this picture.  She looked good right then when she was doing the underwear show.  She couldn't have...  She shouldn't have been any heavier.  Underpants.  See, this...  Underpants.  This is exactly what...  Underwear.  This is exactly what I'm getting at.  Paul from Philly.  Go ahead, Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, that 510-161 is not bad at all, man. 
[02:19:30]  That's the problem.  Not bad.  Yeah, come on.  Ain't bad, not bad.  It ain't model.  Not supermodel, sir.  Well, yeah.  It's not the emaciated, you know, bone bags that are walking around.  All right, thanks, bro.  Jason, front page.  Yes, I meant front cover.  I'll tell you what's ideal.  What's Dakota's height and weight?  Oh, my God.  Do we got her latest freaking sound bite?  We have one?  Proving my point from yesterday.  Proving your point.  Let me prove my point. 
[02:20:00]  She's adorable.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Steve, remind me of what I did to you this morning.  Steve, the trucker, what's up?  Hopi.  Yeah.  First I want to say, no homo.  Okay.  You're about 5'10", 160 pounds.  You're not bad, are you?  No.  Hopi did that in the office.  You don't understand, Steve.  We were discussing this before the show today.  Yeah.  And, you know, it wasn't good enough to bring up on the first half of the Opinant.  You know, we only say the A material for over there. 
[02:20:30]  Exactly.  I go to Anthony, look, 5'10", 160.  And then I stand up.  Would you want to look at this?  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, Tyrus says there's no problem with 5'10", 160.  And then Hopi stands up and he goes, this is it.  Wow.  If I could, if I could say, you've got to realize, Hopi, I don't mean no disrespect, but you're  kind of a smaller guy.  Yeah.  The average guy is a lot bigger than you. 
[02:21:00]  Look at Kenny, for example.  Yeah.  Hopi Kenny.  Can you imagine him with a 105-pound woman?  Kenny's big by retard standards.  Yeah.  Kenny is massive.  He is a big, big boy.  You're right.  All right, Steve.  Hey, Steve, what are you hauling today?  I'm hauling all kinds of freight.  LTL freight.  Yeah.  That's what it's called.  Sorry.  Oh, nothing exciting.  A bunch of shit.  Nothing exciting at all.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  All right.  Have a good night.  There goes Steve the Trucker.  He's a faithful listener of the show.  So his truck can jackknife and spill all the merchandise all over the street, and no one 
[02:21:30]  would care.  No one would care.  We might have it?  I'm trying to find it.  Oh.  All right.  A little disappointed in Than here.  This should be something.  He doesn't even crack like a little smile when you goof on him.  That's right.  He's not like Iraq who will look over and give you that smirk like, fuck you, or something.  Than just doesn't acknowledge criticism.  It's like it never happened. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, he does acknowledge it.  Oh, inside.  In his head.  He holds it in deep, and then weeps at night in the fetal position.  Listen, you fucking asshole.  I know that I can do your job right now.  Oh.  That's what...  That's Than's brain.  Yeah.  Speaking of which.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh.  There you go.  Oh, my goodness.  That's awful.  She's fucking fat.  Ah, damn.  He comes running in with it.  Ah, ha.  It's old day late and dollar short damn.  Wow. 
[02:22:30]  What a fucking slob.  Holy fucking beast.  I'd like to bang her like that.  Definitely.  Like the fat ass one?  Yeah.  Is she fat?  No.  Boxed by stinks.  Well, we expect a little more from Tyra Banks, and they caught her off guard looking a little  in a one piece, and now she's trying to defend that because she can't take any criticism.  Turn that around.  Just say, hey, it was the holidays.  I gained a few pounds, and I'm back doing what I do.  Let me see the colored picture.  All right. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  She has problem hips, man.  Yep.  She has problem hips and thighs.  Holy motherfucker.  Her hips don't lie, and they're saying, I'm a fat cunt.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, that was mean.  It was mean and completely accurate.  Wow.  No reason for that.  What an awful bathing suit.  What the heck?  Yeah, it's awful.  That's a swimsuit.  And those are massive thighs.  She'd come with one of those fucking bathing caps with the flowers on them. 
[02:23:30]  Old grandma.  Grandma swimsuit.  You know, just suck it up.  You got caught with an awful bathing suit on a few pounds overweight.  She must have fucking just eaten like a maniac.  Look at all this.  What is that?  It wasn't there when she pulled her fucking robe off and was in her undies.  In her tiny lingerie.  In her little panties.  She had the flat stomach.  Gained close to 30 pounds.  30 pounds?  Yeah.  Was she fucking playing La Mata? 
[02:24:00]  Jesus Christ.  Is that her?  Huh?  That's her?  Yeah.  That is her.  Look at the forehead on her.  But she came out today claiming, you know, I'm not fat.  Whatever, dude.  You gained 30 pounds.  I thought it was Forrest Whitaker from this distance.  The first twat of Scotland.  Alright, whatever. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, we have to do this because I need to know what is wrong with this girl from American Idol last night.  Retard?  No.  No.  Last night's American Idol was all about the crazies.  There were a lot of crazies, a lot of crying.  Good.  It was a bizarre show last night.  And any of you guys see Sarah Goldberg?  I DVR'd it.  Okay.  So I have to watch it later.  We have a little bit later.  Well, Sarah Goldberg, she was another one of these very happy people. 
[02:25:00]  And by the end of it, she was a raving lunatic.  Was she crying lunatic or angry?  And I want someone out there to diagnose what this girl has.  Because is it manic, depression, you know, let's see.  We will give it a diagnosis.  All right.  Well, here's Sarah Goldberg, the crazy girl.  Sarah Goldberg.  Hi, Sarah Goldberg.  How are you?  I'm good.  You're 20?  Yes.  I am 20 years old. 
[02:25:30]  Sounds like any happy 20-year-old, right?  What did she look like?  I saw your face.  No, nothing wrong, really.  Really?  Yeah.  Average?  I was going to say, average looking girl.  Average 20-year-old girl.  Not ugly.  All right.  Not overweight.  All right.  Not over the top pretty, but not bad.  Did she look like a Goldberg?  Not really.  No?  No.  All right.  Just asking.  So, what do you sing? 
[02:26:00]  Selena, dreaming of you.  Whenever you're ready.  I no longer need this.  What?  She took off a cosmetic lens.  Late at night, run all the world.  Jimmy had to work his sandwich into his mouth like a chipmunk into his cheek to get that line out.  Thank God he did.  I'm going for the real answer.  Who gives a shit about the real answer?  They wanted a joke there, and I failed them miserably.  Oh, I know, because I watch. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, God.  I really do stink.  Just keep calling me a board op.  I deserve it.  Oh, God.  Oh, I know.  Just like 32 million other people.  It was a red cowboy hat.  I never would have guessed that.  Fuck.  Cowboy hat.  That's where the joke fits.  Yeah, I was, like, working.  I'm, like, trying to think of something, and I look over at Jimmy, and he's tucking food into his cheek to get a line out. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Without spitting half of it out.  I'm fast.  I make a wank.  I did fucking mush that through a turkey sandwich.  And I'm glad you did.  Eddie?  I no longer need this.  Quunk.  Late at night when all the world is sleeping, I stay up and think of you.  And I wish on a star that somewhere you are thinking of me, too. 
[02:27:30]  Because I'm dreaming of you tonight till tomorrow I'll be holding you tight, and there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be than here in my room dreaming about you and me.  All right.  So that happens, right? 
[02:28:00]  That's a good question.  Holy shit, that girl is worse than I saw the signs.  Well, okay, maybe not, but on par.  So, Ann, this is what's good, because you didn't see this.  No.  So you would probably think, all right, this is going to play out like any other bad audition.  Right.  Oh, God, she's here just to be the next William Hong, like half these people.  Thanks for showing up.  Take it easy.  Right.  Other door.  Right.  Right.  So you're thinking, okay, Goof Factor, William Hong, another one of these, right? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  It takes a nice little twist here.  Oh.  A fine little twist.  Can I ask you a question?  Hmm?  Do you, in your heart, really think you can sing?  No.  Okay, that's really...  That was honest.  Good.  So why are you here?  Listen to me.  Uh-oh.  I'm not a singer.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  We agree.  Couldn't figure that out.  You're standing there shaking your head the entire time.  Couldn't figure that out.  I'm melting.  You are...  Paula, you're looking at him and you're laughing at me?  No, I'm looking at him. 
[02:29:00]  No, no, no.  I'm laughing with you.  So you came because you wanted to be on TV?  I mean, you were laughing.  No.  No.  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  I...  Now I'm going to get all emotional.  Oh, no.  I'm not a singer.  No, we got that.  You know, I really love to sing.  I really do.  And my friends make fun of me all the time because I'm tone deaf.  But...  Yeah, well...  Shut up.  It's true.  I don't need to hear you say it.  I know it.  Okay.  See?  I'm getting douche chill. 
[02:29:30]  Even if I don't sing, I can be the next American Idol.  Why?  And you want to know why?  Yeah, I love to know why.  You want to know why?  Yeah.  Because I've never sung before.  And so you can teach me how to sing.  Huh?  Yes.  I think I practice.  I practice with, like, music.  I can't believe I'm crying.  But...  Dude, I'm getting douche chills.  Like, I'm all douche down right now.  Holy mother of God, I must see this.  I have got to watch this.  I won't be ignored, Dan. 
[02:30:00]  Dan.  Rabbit stew coming up.  No shit.  That's what I was thinking.  It's every broad that plays this stalker in a movie.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Oh, boy.  You gave her a good deep fuck.  Certainly did.  Good deep dicking left from the tub with bleeding wrists.  Holy fuck.  Dude.  Like, I can be an American Idol because I don't sing.  And you can teach me.  Dude.  She creeped me out so bad.  I'm thinking at home last time.  Like, this girl is walking around among us right now. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  It gets better.  No, that wasn't the end?  No.  Holy shit.  That's right.  She's going to pull out her cock and sing Minnie the Moocher.  I think you don't have to sing to be an American Idol.  I really don't.  I think Paris Hilton can't really sing.  I think that there are...  She's not an American Idol. 
[02:31:00]  I'm actually aware of that.  I know that you don't realize it, but I am a little bit smart here.  Look at these people behind you.  Just turn around.  See these five winners?  They had one thing in common.  They were all great singers.  This is a singing competition.  It's not a competition of, like, trying to find the best person that can't sing but really wants to.  You know what, Randy?  Yes.  These people can sing.  Yeah.  Yes, they can.  But I could be the only American Idol who has never sang before. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, I can't sing either.  Look at this.  I'm unique.  Woo!  Sarah, I don't think there's anything left to say.  I think you actually said it all.  You entered a singing competition, and you don't sing.  So what do you think we're going to say?  We have to move on.  We have to move on.  Carol, yes or no?  Well, no.  Paula, yes or no?  Sorry for that.  It's a no.  Sorry.  And I'm sorry that you're upset.  And you guys are going to regret this.  So you got what you wanted.  You got some fame out of it.  That's not what I wanted.  Are you kidding? 
[02:32:00]  I wanted to be the next American Idol.  Dude, I'm getting douche chills.  Wow.  Douche chills.  I am so glad I have that on the DVR.  I am going to fast forward directly to her and watch it ten times.  Remember, she started out all happy.  She's turning like...  How great would it be if she dropped an N-bomb on Randy?  Oh, would that be great?  You don't tell me I can't sing, you uppity nigger.  I'll have you killed. 
[02:32:30]  Closing a robe like fucking Leon Shermer in Dog Day Afternoon.  You're not dying, Randy.  You're killing everyone around you.  Wow.  She really lost it.  Guess what?  There's more?  There's more peace.  Oh, thank God.  It brings it on home.  Mama, it's not the end.  It's just the beginning.  No, it's not the beginning.  That's pretty obvious.  Well, at least she's not harboring any resentment towards the judges. 
[02:33:00]  It's absolutely rude.  Like, you are people.  We are people, too.  Just because we don't have a million dollars and we don't have singing deals doesn't mean  that we don't have lives and doesn't mean that we don't have important things in our lives.  I've become friends with these guys.  I've become friends with Ray and Jen and build a security guy because I have been here forever.  And you know what?  They told me that these people went out last night drinking in New York City until 3 o'clock 
[02:33:30]  in the morning.  And that is rude.  That is rude.  Dude, too real for me.  Deuce chills.  She, uh, she's fucking mental.  She'd make a great girlfriend.  Could you imagine dealing with that?  Holy fuck.  She started out all happy.  Yeah.  She's all chipper. 
[02:34:00]  For me to tolerate her, her pussy lips would have to look like a fucking half-blown-up life raft.  Hey, bully click.  Get in here.  Let's say hi to Dan the trucker.  Dan, what's up?  Morning, guys.  I think the bitches are bipolar myself.  Uh, bipolar are you going with?  Yeah, the reason I say bipolar is because my wife and my mother are both bipolar and  hence I drive a truck. 
[02:34:30]  You know what I mean?  So they turn like that just out of nowhere?  Yeah, just they're your friend and then they're your enemy.  Just basically they love you and then they scratch your fucking eyes out.  Yeah, she reminds me of, uh, my ex-wife after a few drinks.  Absolutely.  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, that, like, like, everything was fine and dandy and then, uh, a few shots of Jack Daniels later.  Boom, that comes out.  Rah!  Crazy cat women is what I call them. 
[02:35:00]  Crazy cat women?  Crazy cat women.  I like that.  I'm going to remember that.  Thanks, Dan.  All right, let's go to Adam in New York.  Adam.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's your take on that?  I dated a girl like this.  Yeah?  And they're absolutely insane.  They're bipolar.  This girl, this girl would be the happiest thing in the world.  She'd be blowing you one minute and then she'd just turn and just completely lose her mind.  And there's nothing, you can't stop them, you can't do anything.  It's like, it's like you're watching a train wreck unfold in front of your eyes. 
[02:35:30]  And then she was a cutter.  She'd start cutting herself.  A cutter?  A cutter.  She'd get depressed and start cutting herself.  I've watched the OC.  Blame the world for it.  I've watched soap operas.  Yeah, and I think you're leaving on an end, sir.  Uh, what's that?  All right, thank you, Adam.  Let's go to Michelle in Seattle.  Hey, guys, good morning.  Hi, good morning.  Good morning.  She is definitely bipolar. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, why?  Like, without a doubt.  I have a sister who's bipolar.  She's psycho.  Are you scared for your life?  That's why I was feeling, like, scared.  Like, that this person's out there somewhere.  What did she do?  Like, what were her facial expressions when she got distorted?  Did her eyes get all big?  Oh, dude, you could tell right away this girl was mental.  She's truly nutty.  Yeah.  Wow.  She'd start off all, like, the happy-go-lucky, just nothing really bothers her type chick,  and then out of nowhere, bam, she lit up. 
[02:36:30]  Wow.  Lit up.  Yeah, and that's what they do.  They go off, and, you know, they know that they're doing it, but they can't stop themselves.  And she has children, and I feel so bad for her kids.  She had children?  No, I don't know.  Oh, no, the woman you know.  Oh, I thought you meant the 20-year-old.  No, no, my sister.  That was on American Idol.  Yeah, yeah.  And you never know who's going to walk through the door.  You're going to be happy sister or psycho sister.  Psycho sister. 
[02:37:00]  Keskis day.  That's like what Ronnie says, though.  I dig crazy chicks.  They're hot.  Something about crazy chicks.  All right, thank you, Michelle.  Yeah, get her on the radio.  I would love to have her on the radio.  Yeah, unfortunately, we haven't been able to get any American Idol people.  I don't know why.  What happened?  I don't know.  Where is she?  What the fuck?  I don't know what happened.  Call us, you nut.  Let's say hi to JT in Virginia. 
[02:37:30]  JT.  Have some flowers, bitch.  We were kidding.  Someone out there knows her.  Let's find her.  Good morning.  Good morning, sweet tits.  Welcome aboard, JT.  Hey, that had to be one of the best meltdowns on Idol ever.  I think what the problem was is that her parents inhaled too much gas in the showers at Auschwitz.  This is Goldberg.  Her parents.  She's 20 years old.  Exactly.  It's not mathematically possible, sir.  What do you think?  They were in Auschwitz, like, waiting through the 70s?  They didn't get the word that things were over?  They just stood there shirtless? 
[02:38:00]  What's the matter with you?  That vile joke you just spit out.  I bet you he said that a fucking, like, spittle came out of the side of his mouth, Auschwitz,  just angry, hating the Jews for no reason.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  I guess it would be possible for her parents to have been in a camp.  I said it was mathematically impossible.  Then I did a little math and said, Anthony, you're an asshole.  I mean, they were kids.  20?  Yeah.  Could have been.  86-ish.  How many years ago?  All right.  So you said you were born in 1940. 
[02:38:30]  No, you were born in 1940.  You were born in 1940.  You're four years old in the camp.  No.  40, 50, 60, 70, 80.  No.  Mathematically impossible.  You'd be 46 when you had the kid?  Six years old when you had a kid.  It's possible.  It ain't happening.  It's possible.  It ain't happening.  That's all I'm saying.  Let's try some experiments.  See if they can be done.  And see if we can change some eyes blue.  We can start banging 46-year-old broads.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  Why don't we take a little break?  A little break-ski.  Very good.  Everything has to end in ski for the rest of the show.  Apparently it did back on regular radio when we played Popeye and it seemed to fly.  Boy, did we get away with fucking murder.  I listened to that.  I was just listening to the Popeye bit from the old NEW days.  And it was like, ugh, her puss-ski, ugh, I stuck-skied in her puss-ski.  Can't say that.  It's like, what the fuck are you thinking? 
[02:39:30]  You're just putting a K in pussy.  I took my cocksk and I ramskied it up her ass.  Guck, guck, guck, guck, guck, guck.  Ugh.  I fuck-skied her in her cunt-ski.  Ugh.  Guck, guck, guck, guck, guck.  It's pretty amazing what we used to get away with when...  She puts my ball-ski in her mouth-ski and I fucking ski-cum-skied in her mouth-ski.  What the fuck we got away with?  It's like, hey, so you'd stay in the ski at the end of everything. 
[02:40:00]  It works.  As-ski.  As-ski.  Right in the old as-ski.  Ups the poops-ski-shoot-ski.  Guck, guck, guck, guck, guck, guck.  And then wimpy blue-ski-me-ski.  Ugh.  We got away with murder when no one knew who we were.  Murder.  Yeah.  It's called flying under the radar.  They used to tell us, you guys are flying under the radar, but eventually you're going  to be on that radar screen.  You know what happens when you fly under the radar?  And then you're going to be in big trouble.  You slam into a mountain.  That's what happens.  Yeah, you want everything on that radar screen.  Why did you choose from Popeyes? 
[02:40:30]  They're from different eras?  They're both different.  Oh, there's this one.  He used to talk about...  And then when he'd like...  I want to make a point.  It'd get louder.  Oh, me goshk.  It's the sea hag.  Oh, and I'm fuckskinna.  Fuckski.  Ba-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-pew.  Look at the size of her clit-ski.  She smells...  I said ski.  She smells like the sea. 
[02:41:00]  The old sea hag.  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  Oh, her cunt-ski is like tuna-ski.  Oh, I can say tuna.  Ba-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-tuna.  All right.  Let's say hi to another trucker.  Yep.  Where have the truckers been, by the way?  What's up, Jason?  On the road.  On the road, sure.  I'll take a guess.  Jason, what are you hauling?  I got Nabisco on right now.  Yeah?  Ah.  Are you guys allowed to sneak a boxer, too?  Cracker.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:41:30]  It's just like...  Got boxes of Nabisco out there.  He's shoving them in his mouth.  Gah-gah-gah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Too real for him.  Yeah.  I mean, these girls can be really, really, really, you know, hostile, you know, if they  turn the other direction, you know.  And, you know, like I said, you know, one night I was just making love to my girlfriend  and then, you know, next thing I know, you know, I got cops and stuff knocking on my  front door, you know.  I was just trying to put my boots on, you know. 
[02:42:00]  I was going to go to my sister's and spend the night with her and all of a sudden, you  know, she's screaming and, you know, she's trying to pull me back into the door and everything  and then, you know, before you know it, you know, I got cops knocking on my front door  and me getting in handcuffs and I went to jail for three days.  Next thing you know, you're on the road eating Nilla wafers and torturing a prostitute with  a stapler.  I love Nilla wafers.  Aren't they great?  Nilla wafers. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  We got one.  We've been doing some fishing.  Amy.  Hi.  Oh, nay.  Hi.  I am bipolar.  Yeah.  And I really hate the way that that chick portrayed us last night.  Really?  I mean, that just, that really threw us in a bad light.  Obviously, she is off her way.  Yes, it did, Amy.  Yes, it did.  All right, she can't hear us.  Hey, no, I'm on my list.  You don't have to. 
[02:43:00]  $100 for the guy that gets her going.  Yeah.  $100 for my fucking wallet to the person that gets her going.  Get her going off?  Okay.  Amy.  Yes.  So, when did you realize you were bipolar?  I was diagnosed when I was about 20.  Yeah.  So, was that a good excuse to use for, like, all the failures in life that you've had?  Actually, a lot of shit that I did when I was a teenager, yeah.  That's not what I'm asking you, sweetheart.  I'm saying for all the failures, the failed relationships and stuff, now you just fall back on the bipolar shit?  Yeah, pretty much.  It's a great excuse. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, is it the parents?  Do you blame them a little bit?  No.  No, you can't blame the parents.  No, huh?  It's a chemical thing.  Yeah.  So, as long as you're on your meds, it's okay.  Oh, good.  Have you taken your meds this morning?  Yes, I have.  And what's the thing that, like, sets you off?  What's the one thing that just makes Amy get stuck in there?  Like, start getting, like, really pissed off, bitch claws coming out, wanting to scratch people's eyes out?  What gets your pola on?  I'm going to get my pola on. 
[02:44:00]  Ignorance, man.  Fucking ignorance.  People that just don't know what the fuck they're talking about.  That really pisses me off.  Let me ask you a question, too.  You say it's chemical, but I don't think so.  I think it's behavioral only.  Yeah.  I actually think it's just an excuse that's been used by the psychiatric community.  Absolutely.  I think you guys hide behind the fact that it's some kind of illness.  It's not an illness.  It's, if I borrow a line from Jimmy's old comedy act, just stop doing it.  Just stop doing that. 
[02:44:30]  It's basically a petulant child grown up who doesn't know how to take no for an answer.  Well, no, I can take no for an answer.  You can't, obviously.  Your behavior has shown that you can't.  But you can at least admit that it's, uh, it's, uh, you're seeking attention and it's  a made-up disease.  It's an awful fucking excuse, though.  We're making up, we're making, we're making up diseases every day at this point.  Yeah, like, look at ADHD, man.  I think, uh, what they're saying here is you just ought to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  Yeah.  Bootstraps.  Uh, I don't know. 
[02:45:00]  I, I, I, I like the excuse, though.  I don't like, I can get away with a lot of shit, man.  I don't like, I don't like being called ignorant.  I really don't, I really think it's just a made-up fucking thing.  No, you guys are awesome.  I wasn't calling you ignorant.  Oh.  Not at all, man.  You guys, you guys, you guys fucking rock.  I mean, I love you guys.  But, no, no, I'm talking about, like, people that I work with that are just so fucking stupid.  No, she's gonna go.  She's Medicare.  And, you know, then the whole John and Jeff thing that's on before you guys just sucks. 
[02:45:30]  Then we have this local light FM radio guy.  Holy shit, shut up, Amy.  No one gives a shit.  I'm sorry.  Save Lucky Louie, though.  All right.  Does anybody remember last day?  You do know you're boring the hell out of the entire audience, right?  You're only on our show because you're a bipolar and we truly believe it's a made-up disease.  Whatever.  You can control those urges.  You don't need medication or therapy.  Better living through chemicals, buddy. 
[02:46:00]  All right, get a car crash it.  No.  I'll let you slide.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Kidding.  Hey, first time caller.  All right, there we go.  All right, hold on.  Crickets, blah, blah, blah.  No, hold on.  People...  Hey.  Amy, hold on.  People actually are very curious about this.  Let's go to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  I got the perfect diagnosis.  She's just a cunt. 
[02:46:30]  Crankus.  Fuck you, buddy.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Crankus.  Let's go to Matt in Arizona.  Matt, you got a question for Amy?  I'd say the term is called bat shit nuts.  What do you mean?  Bat shit nuts.  I think it is bat shit nuts.  They get in front of the...  They're going to be nice.  They're going to try to get on idle.  They get turned down in life like they've been all life.  And they just go bat shit nuts.  It's not bipolar. 
[02:47:00]  It's just an excuse, like you're saying.  What is that other thing?  Crazier than a shit house rat?  Yeah.  That's a crazy thing, a shit house rat.  Yep.  Just running around, can't get out.  Smells like shit.  Let's go to Fred.  Fred?  Scares people.  Hey, Amy.  Hey, guys.  Amy.  What medication are you on?  What medication are you on?  Lexapro.  Lexapro.  Now, this chemically changes you?  I mean, what happened in your youth?  What actually happened in your youth that you think led you down this road? 
[02:47:30]  Dude, are you going to fucking psychoanalyze me?  Jesus.  No, I don't.  Somebody's $200 fucking dollars an hour to do that shit, all right?  Yeah, but I'd like to understand what you think led you down this road.  Because, you know, a lot of people are listening and you're like, it's scary just listening to you.  You think you need a medication to get through the day?  It's 944 in the morning.  You're already on pills.  What led you to this point in life?  Where did the diagnosis start? 
[02:48:00]  Uncle?  Cousin?  Fucking people like you, man.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not like me.  I was never in your youth.  Come on, Amy.  Tell me.  What is it?  What is it?  What an uncle?  What, gee, when I was younger?  Um, um, oh, fuck.  No, no, no, no.  That's the medication talking, dear.  Let's talk to the brain here.  Was it an uncle?  Was it a horsey right on the knee?  Hand under there?  What was it when it originated all this?  Yeah, I had an Uncle Paul. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, see, you're letting the medication talk.  You gotta let the people of America hear the real Amy.  You gotta call in maybe before you take that pill.  That pill sets you right.  What happens if you forget that pill?  Oh, nothing.  Nothing?  You just coast through life?  Yeah, pretty much.  Everything's fine, huh?  So why do you take the pill at all?  Because I want to.  Oh, see, I'm starting to doubt this because you got a perfect opportunity to explain the 
[02:49:00]  disease that you're saying you need to take medication for.  And you're not even pursuing an opportunity to inform millions on how this kind of disease  can start.  Come on, Amy.  Help the audience out here.  You got an opportunity.  I have children.  I have a daughter.  I'd like to know where this type of thing originates so I can avoid this.  Seriously, are you just fucking for real, dude? 
[02:49:30]  I really am for real.  Come on.  What starts this disease?  What starts you being able to have no emotional control?  Where does that originate?  Your day starts with a coffee and a pill.  Why?  Why?  That's a good question.  Why?  It's probably just seeking attention.  You're completely out of control of yourself?  Without this little pill in the morning, you'd flip? 
[02:50:00]  No, I didn't say that.  Then why do you need a pill prescribed to you?  What makes you bipolar?  One minute, everything's fine.  And the next minute, fuck you all.  What is that?  Where is that line?  What causes it?  Come on.  You're not answering.  People are listening.  We need an answer.  Oh, no.  You guys rock.  I'm punching out.  Fucking Amy.  No, no, no.  Come on.  It's me and you. 
[02:50:30]  They're listening.  But I am an answer.  I want to know.  Well.  I think she was turning.  Turning?  I had a guy.  Come on, man.  50 bucks.  50 bucks.  That was an absolute.  I would have gave you a hundred.  I would have gave you a hundred.  No problem.  You guys knew me, too, man.  I would have loved to have that.  You are.  Let me tell you something.  You're a good.  I'd have hung up.  You are so fucking annoying.  Who is he?  The voice.  The whole thing.  Yeah.  I recognize you, Fred.  Yeah.  I recognize you, Fred.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  You guys met my boy, Mike.  You would probably remember my boy, Mike.  You all took pictures with him.  I remember this guy's voice.  Yeah.  Oh, it's so grating and condescending.  Hey.  I just want to learn.  I just want to learn.  I have kids.  Exactly.  I really did.  You're a despicable human being.  When I introduced my friend to you, you gave me the look of I'm a despicable human being.  Yeah, I probably did.  And he doesn't mind me saying it.  Do you remember who my friend is?  No, we don't remember.  Of course, we don't remember anybody. 
[02:51:30]  I work with people in this building, I swear to you.  I point out people, unless they wear name tags, I don't know what the fuck their names are.  Well, speaking of which, and I have name tags on right now.  Right now.  We need them.  I'm like, oh yeah, I do a show with Anthony.  There he is, right there.  Jimmy, he's got one.  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  Who's your friend?  By the way, Sam K. from Long Island.  Are you two morons to believe bipolar doesn't exist?  Maybe this idiot doesn't have bipolar, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Way to pay attention, Sam K. 
[02:52:00]  All right, Bill, get us out of here.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis. 
[02:52:30]  You're insane.  Yup.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  What is this?  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not dying.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism. 
[02:53:00]  Oh my God.  Alright, we're back.  But that's why.  Yes.  What happened?  We're a little distracted.  They're throwing rocks in Beirut.  Here are rocks.  They got a big thing going on.  A big protest.  Rocks against tanks.  Rocks against tanks.  Yeah, a little faction.  Yeah, call me crazy, but I think tanks are going to win again.  Tanks win.  Tank beats rock.  Tank beats rock.  Rock, paper, gun.  Rock, paper, tank. 
[02:53:30]  And we were saying during the break, because this is on CNN, it's live, developing story.  What?  Students protesting in Beirut?  At least one student killed in clashes between students.  Tank students.  Students?  Tank students and rock students going at it?  Yeah.  No, loyalists and the opposition.  Loyalists and the opposition.  Very good.  I was telling Anthony and Jimmy during the break that I kind of liked the day.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to live in this era.  Speak for yourself.  The day when, back in the day, when you just didn't know what was going on on the other 
[02:54:00]  side of the world.  You know?  It was, uh...  You're doing your primitive farming somewhere from World Away.  Primitive farming, trying to, I don't know, eke out a meal for your family.  Little existence.  You're talking like Little House on the Prairie days?  I'm talking when you had like a little more hair than we have now.  Just a little more.  Not caveman, but somewhere in between where all you wanted to do was fucking give your 
[02:54:30]  family a meal.  So you never found out what was happening on the other side?  Never found out what was happening on the other side of the world.  The sun is shining bright.  You got primitive farm tools.  The birds are chirping.  And little did you know on the other side of the world, Vikings were beheading each other.  Just like impaling each other?  Oh yeah.  Just horrific things were going on.  The guys were getting the nickname, The Impaler.  Right.  Entire races of people were just being wiped out. 
[02:55:00]  Slaughtered.  And you know what?  You went through your life, you had no fucking idea.  No clue.  No clue.  It didn't matter.  You were trying to figure out how to get to that little island over there.  Couldn't figure out how to make a boat yet.  Didn't really understand the concept.  And on the other side of the world, oh, they got boats, Vikings.  Oh, they're just hacking people.  Just violating Viking women because there were no rules back then.  No law.  Well, it's part of the thing of war.  You know, you beat people up, you conquer people, and then you've got to rape the women.  Yeah.  Just with the rules. 
[02:55:30]  And now you just turn on the TV and you know what's going on.  And it's live pictures of Beirut.  Every corner of the world.  Must have been nicer though back then when you just relax.  You're just trying to like live and, you know, watch your beloved die of typhoid at age 24.  The typhus.  Yeah.  That's great.  What happened?  Oh, she got the consumption.  The fuck is that?  So, you know what?  The leeches.  You know, watch TV.  We don't know what that is.  We like to carve little scenes into whale teeth. 
[02:56:00]  Scrimshaw.  Arr.  Your wife would get the consumption and then you'd have to bang the ugly broad in town so you had someone that raised the kids.  You have to wait until she died coughing up the blood.  Because life was just simple back then.  It was just no hospital or anything.  They just laid in the bed up in the room while coughing into a white hanky with bloodstains on it.  And then when you die, they just put you in the parlor downstairs. 
[02:56:30]  You'd have to wait outside the doors.  The doctor's in there and comes out with the little briefcase.  Eh, could be ours.  I would do something, but it's 1740.  I don't have a clue.  I know as much as you.  I just got the title of doctor.  We haven't even figured out that washing our hands could save half the people we work on.  I was out tilling dirt.  Now I'm going to fucking put my fingers in your colon, sir.  Right.  Elbow deep in your fucking organs. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, maybe that's the problem.  I don't know.  Just bite on this bullet.  I'll start hacking shit off and hope for the best.  Cut something off.  Yeah.  Whatever you have a problem with.  We have to remove a leg.  Well, will I be anesthetized?  I don't know what that is.  But here, chew on this wallet for a moment and have a sip of whiskey.  That's a whiskey.  I'll do it.  That'll straighten you out.  As I saw your fucking leg off with this meat saw I borrowed from the butcher.  Oh, my God.  But now, look.  Many different camera angles. 
[02:57:30]  But there's a day you wouldn't even know this was going on somewhere else.  Look at that.  They got three different views there.  One from, I guess, Al Jazeera.  25 hurt in clashes.  And they're showing it as a party.  Opposition in Beirut.  It's a New Year's celebration.  Yeah.  All right.  Protest against the...  How is America involved in screwing this whole thing up?  How are we to blame for this?  The ugly Americans.  I'm sure they'll figure it out.  Yeah.  There'll be some kind of angle.  All right.  Hey, Shark Guy. 
[02:58:00]  Let's get into Shark Guy for a few minutes.  Well, seems he got into the shark.  It was a little.  Cute story.  They had this really bad fucking animation on the news earlier.  That was the most piss-poor fucking animation I've ever seen.  It was supposed to depict the diver underwater getting half-eaten by this shark.  Sorry.  That's okay.  I have to learn to look down when we go on to another subject.  Yeah.  It would really help this show.  But Jason from Rye. 
[02:58:30]  Don't forget the leeches.  Got a problem in your foot?  Let me put some leeches on your colon.  That'll work.  I'll cure whatever ails you.  Anyway, bad animation.  Yeah, they showed the shark story guy.  People have heard of it.  It was just diving and a shark bit him.  Apparently almost in half.  What half, though?  Like it had his head and shoulders and stuff.  Get the fuck out.  In his mouth.  It took his shampoo.  Swift, yes. 
[02:59:00]  Fucking cornball.  That was great.  Give me that back, you.  He hit him in the eye with perks and it really...  I guess the graphics department over at whatever news place that was, station, got together  and put an animation together.  And it was just the worst, cheesiest looking thing.  Can't blame him.  Budget cuts.  Yeah.  That's budget cuts.  Perhaps.  So they got some college kids.  They used like dolls. 
[02:59:30]  That's how bad it was.  God, how funny would that be on the news?  This guy's hand just...  And then he'd swim in.  Grr.  That's what they used to do.  What?  Like with the...  Well, not...  Maybe I should clarify.  Well, I know what the kid touches stories they did.  No, with the Apollo landings on the moon.  You'd have the guy and he'd have the models.  They'd have models of the Apollo, the lunar module and the moon's surface and the guy would  hold it and go...  And what the lunar module will do is... 
[03:00:00]  And he'd hold it up and it has to land and he'd slowly bring it down on the surface of  this big model of the moon.  How old are you?  I remember this as a kid.  Patrice asks that question on a daily basis when he's in here.  I was very...  How old are you?  I don't remember that shit.  I was very interested in the space program when I was a kid.  You don't seem...  Older than me?  No.  It's just...  I was very interested as a child watching this.  And I remember seeing that.  They'd use models and stuff.  Now it's all computer graphics. 
[03:00:30]  That's all they use when they show things like, you know, with...  Oh, shit.  What, Jimmy?  I was just wondering.  You said they used models.  Maybe we misunderstood.  Maybe that was the type of model he was talking about.  That could have been a lunar module model.  Lunar module.  Or limb.  I like yogurt.  A guy survives being in a shark's mouth.  Let's listen in on this one.  A lifetime lover of the sea, 41-year-old Eric Nurhus is a professional diver. 
[03:01:00]  But his career and his life nearly came to an end when he found himself trapped in the  jaws of a 10-foot white pointer shark.  I was off diving in one of the spots where I've been hundreds of times.  I was following a line of abalone on the seafloor on the top of the reef and had my head down.  Next minute, I was just hit that hard.  I was a bit shocked because I wasn't sure what happened to me concentrating on these abalone. 
[03:01:30]  Next minute, I'm in like a dark cave that's squashing me like a vice.  I went straight into its mouth, front onwards, and one, my shoulders, my head, and one arm went straight down into its throat.  And then I could feel the teeth crunching up and down on my weight vest.  It had me, like, half my body was in its mouth.  Oh, holy shit, Jesus Christ.  The guy, all of a sudden, you're just, bloop, bloop, you're looking at abalone, and then you're in a fucking shark's mouth feeling his throat as his teeth are biting down on you. 
[03:02:00]  That's fantastic.  Stay out of the ocean.  There's monsters in there, real live monsters.  That's a monster.  If there weren't sharks, if sharks didn't exist, and someone wrote one and made a movie about it, you'd be like, oh, my God, that's the most horrible monster.  They're real.  That's a real, live, living monster.  We're safe here.  Don't get scared.  But when you go in the water, there's monsters. 
[03:02:30]  There's monsters under there.  The shark knocked Eric's oxygen mask off his face, breaking his nose.  Struggling to breathe, Eric made a split-second decision that would save his life.  I poked my fingers into the eye socket, which the shark reacted to in a way that it opened its mouth a bit.  The first thing, when I did jab it in the eye and retrieve my upper body and head from its mouth, was to put my reg back in and get a breath of air, which enabled me to act in a calm manner and ascend nice and carefully without kicking and splashing too much. 
[03:03:00]  Once he reached the surface, Eric shouted for his son, who was on a nearby boat, having no idea what had just happened to his father.  This shoulder has got some deep lacerations.  I can't use this arm at the moment because the muscle's cut.  I've got three punctures in my right chest muscle.  And on my back, I've got five or six puncture wounds. 
[03:03:30]  Despite the incredible pain, he considers himself very lucky.  I couldn't think of a worse way to go than to end up as fish food, to be honest with you.  Those fucking Australians.  Is that where he's from?  Yeah.  Because they're hysterical.  Just cool under pressure.  I almost had my head taken off.  And then I grabbed his eyeball and retrieved my head and shoulder and took a breath of oxygen and leisurely took a swim up. 
[03:04:00]  I figured I'd continue looking for abalone.  The guy didn't fucking...  How...  Wouldn't you just be like...  Getting the bends because you're just fucking flying up to the surface?  That would be the most frightening fucking thing.  He's going, oh, I ascended slyly.  Mike sure didn't kick or nothing.  Didn't kick.  You would be screaming and flailing. 
[03:04:30]  Trying to fucking curl your legs up into your face.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Just trying to swim hell and then get to the top.  Help me!  Get the boat!  It's like his son didn't know what happened.  He probably went, hey, Mike, you want to bring the boat over here?  Could use a...  Ah, Shaq bit me head off.  I'm fine now, though.  Jesus.  Fucking Aussies are hysterical.  A shark bit me head off.  Tough bunch of fucks.  You gotta always look on the bright side. 
[03:05:00]  Jason from Rye.  Couldn't think of a worse way to go.  He could have been the goat.  A little goat recall.  And they found an ancient shark yesterday?  Yep.  Yeah, that looks like an eel.  It's really creepy looking.  Let me take a look at that.  And then...  Oh, yeah.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  So he poke-skied the shark-ski.  In the ice-ski.  Oh, in the ice-socket-ski.  Then I fuck-skied it.  Until it had a heart attack-ski. 
[03:05:30]  That's what you gotta do.  Yeah.  Kevin from Beverly.  There's the goat strategy on it.  Did he light a match like Pinocchio so the shark would sneeze and let him go?  Doesn't work.  And then, Chuck, there's monsters in the motherfucking ocean.  Kind of like snakes on a plane.  There are.  I didn't feel like blowing out my voice.  And then someone is commenting on how old Anthony is.  Lewis from Canada.  And is so old.  No.  All right.  His social security number is three. 
[03:06:00]  No.  His social security number is three.  What is that?  It's an old shark.  That's what they found?  What the fuck is that?  Like a cock with fucking fins.  It looks like a dolphin with a shark coming out of it.  It's gross.  Where did they find that?  It was near the surf.  They usually swim too deep for people to see them.  They very rarely see live samples.  But it died shortly after because they took it in. 
[03:06:30]  It was sick.  Rare shark captured on film.  Where did they find this?  Tokyo?  Yeah.  It was sick.  It's actually in a hotel.  How do people see that?  Because they've got to see that.  That is fucked up.  What was the search on that there, Thun?  It's on CNN.com front page right now.  It's on the front page.  All right.  CNN.com.  Under the science section.  That's fucking weird.  Eating broth with a robe on.  It was ill.  His friend, partner shark, was found dead with a lit Morse cigarette clenched between 
[03:07:00]  his fins.  Morse?  With a tip on it.  Like, you know, the old queens of the tipped cigarette.  As he was walking his dogfish.  He was noodling, but not for catfish.  It was in the anus of another shark.  We interrupt this program to breathe.  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Stoney!  Who saw this going on?  What's up, Stoney? 
[03:07:30]  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm driving into...  I'm actually in the parking lot of the health club, and there's a fucking...  A retarded midget in front of this tax place wearing a Statue of Liberty outfit.  What?  You know what?  Meanwhile, back at the show...  Let's just leave that one alone.  Just let it sit.  Let it sit.  Play the home version of the Opie and Anthony show and have fun with that one. 
[03:08:00]  Wow.  Holy crap.  I got an interesting text I would like to share with the show.  Is it from Kenny?  No, no, no.  It's from my ex, Erin.  Oh, God.  I love when she contacts you.  Yeah, yeah.  I do, too.  I miss her.  She's a...  Speaking of kooks...  Oh, boy.  She's nutty.  I'm in criminal court right now listening to your show while I wait.  I got arrested.  I say why, and then she names her ex-boyfriend, punched me and butted me with a knife.  Then he called the police like an idiot, and they arrested both of us, even though I was 
[03:08:30]  the one bleeding.  And then the cops roughed me up.  I was bleeding from the cops in addition to what he did to me.  It's a crazy story.  You got to hear it.  He just went crazy.  I spent three days in Central booking.  Can you call her right now?  Well, that's...  Can we get her on the phone?  Well, she's in court.  I don't think...  Yeah, but she says she's listening.  She just texts.  You can text.  You just...  And she went, uh, he's crazy.  You even warned me that one day he'd flip out and hurt me.  Do you remember telling me that? 
[03:09:00]  You dead?  I don't know.  I should type back.  I was just trying to fuck you.  Exactly.  Why'd you warn her?  You wouldn't get entertaining texts like this.  Oh, he's a...  She's a nutty one, too, but she's not as crazy as him, I don't think.  She's pretty kooky.  Wow.  Can we get her on the phone or no?  Oh, she just said, I would love to go on radio and blast the cops that beat me up.  Get her on the phone.  That's why I just texted her.  Can you call?  Does she know the numbers?  No, I mean, I don't even know if she can't because she's in court. 
[03:09:30]  You want to text the number just in case?  Um...  I don't know which one they would give you.  Yeah, I would...  I'd love to know if she was resisting at all.  I don't know.  I could see her...  I could see her resisting.  Yeah.  Or at least mouthing off.  Should have tased her.  That'd be great.  Which one?  The 646?  Yeah.  Give out the rest of the end of them.  Oh, don't be fresh.  You want to take a quick break?  You're getting fresh.  Bill, how about a quick one?  We'll go quick.  Go.  Quick break.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years. 
[03:10:00]  This is probably the worst.  Back...  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW.  Not sure of the call letters.  1590 Day Timer.  Signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Oh!  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The, uh, Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:10:30]  All right, we're patiently waiting for Jimmy's ex to call the show.  She's at Central Booking here in New York City.  Some kind of altercation.  The police.  With a, uh, with a boyfriend.  Yeah.  I love the boyfriend stories with her.  Ah, she's the greatest.  We sat at Starbucks once.  I don't know how long ago now.  Two years ago?  Probably at least two years ago. 
[03:11:00]  And she had story after story after story.  After me, we broke up.  And we, uh, we didn't talk for a while.  And then we went back to being friends.  Because she's actually, like, just one of my favorite fucking goofy people to know.  And she, um, was dating this other guy.  Who was, like, she had dated a couple people after me.  And then she was, like, in a serious relationship with this guy.  Who's, like, a hedge fund guy who makes millions of dollars.  But he's nuts.  He's nuts.  He's truly crazy.  And so she.  And, uh, it was very funny to, uh, listen to some of the stories.  And she was really open. 
[03:11:30]  She doesn't care.  And she would always tell me these fucking, I'm like, you're gonna kill each other.  She broke his plasma.  I mean, just lunacy.  Lunacy.  She always accused him of going with hookers.  She had his, like, phone tapped, uh, you know, key stroke save on his computer that would  email her everything he typed.  I mean, I don't know how she's just, she's actually really bright.  You wouldn't, you know, you think, ah, she's just nutty with big tits.  But she's really, she's a very smart, fucking deceptive, sneaky detective.  Yeah, absolutely think she's crazy.  Oh, she's nuts.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Well, I don't know if she's gonna call.  If she can, she will.  Yeah, of course she will.  She wants to just badmouth people.  I got a taste of something.  Well, I don't know if we have time to do the whole thing, but.  What?  Now, look at me.  I have a sweet papacy.  Now, what's your fault?  The Bible said that I was wonderfully and fearfully mean by God. 
[03:12:30]  Do you know God never says oops?  God never says oops.  People, I have learned to be content in whatsoever state.  A deaf evangelist?  For the first time in my life, I found out that I'm not okay.  A retarded Jesus freak? 
[03:13:00]  God love me anyway.  He rocks in her voice.  And people, will you ever find out you not okay?  But that's okay.  God love you anyway.  It will change your life.  Steve before voice lessons.  Stroke guy.  You were not born to lose.  You were born to win.  And you can lead today a champion in the game of life. 
[03:13:30]  I love that name.  Spin the wheel.  Yeah.  Get a number.  You move.  Well, when I think evangelists, I don't think people with disabilities.  I would think they would be cursing God.  Don't you think?  I wish they would.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  What's his affliction?  Cerebral palsy.  Oh, I didn't go with the palsy.  Damn it.  Yeah, it's an evangelist with cerebral palsy. 
[03:14:00]  Ew.  Wow.  And you're just thanking God.  Hey, man.  That's having some faith, man.  Exactly.  Wow.  God fucked me, but I think he's great.  Wow.  I guess you gotta.  You're looking for the fucking, you know.  Danny, what do you know about this guy?  Well, not a lot, really.  Just, uh, I just knew the answer, so I was just hanging around in case you guys couldn't  guess it.  Oh, thanks.  But, uh, yeah, CP.  It's terrific.  Yeah, wow.  You can't understand what he's saying.  Barely. 
[03:14:30]  Barely.  I just, I find, I just was amazed that this guy was so into God.  That's, well, you gotta think about it.  All right.  God kind of fucked him a little bit on this whole thing.  A little bit, a little bit.  On the, on the planetary level here, on this plane, but you would think he's probably,  he wants to get in good so that next time around, when he goes up to heaven or wherever  you go.  When God goes for take two?  Right.  Take two.  Extra innings.  Whatever.  He might not decide to drink that day.  Then, yeah.  Then, uh, he turns out to be a guy, uh, you know, top of the heap. 
[03:15:00]  Hmm.  Never know.  I like this.  Maybe that's it.  I like this, uh, thinking, like, differently stuff.  Reincarnation, you mean?  No, just, you know, yeah, whatever the afterlife is.  How funny would it be if he goes to the afterlife and he's even worse?  Worse off.  Like, not only does no one else have cerebral palsy, but angels like to beat people who  do.  With their wings.  They beat you.  With their giant wings.  Yeah.  You're like a fucking muskrat with cerebral palsy. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, even God hates you.  No, it would be hilarious.  He has all that hope and he comes back as that goat.  We were talking about, oh, the poor goat.  I thought it would be better this time.  We're a healthy, good-looking guy named Dirk who's on his way to his first modeling thing  and then he's paralyzed by a drunk driver with cerebral palsy.  Dirk.  Oh, wow.  Well.  That is an awful fucking philosophy where if you did something bad in a past life, you 
[03:16:00]  got to come back and, like, deal with some fucking affliction.  It would be great if you had recollection of what you did.  There's no fucking accountability.  Like, you're just, you're reincarnated into a fucking disaster and you just got to go,  oh, this is my life because I fucked up before but I have no fucking recollection of it.  You know, people say, though, that we do continue because we are made of energy.  I mean, when you break it down, we are just kind of energy, so.  And this is hell right now.  Oh, that one.  That old gag. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Got some great blowjobs in hell.  Thank you.  Hell ain't all that bad when you think about it.  I would think hell would be devoid of the blowjob.  I know.  Like, there's no, this can't be all.  If anybody ever suggests that we're living hell right now.  Well, that blows that theory out of the water.  Jimmy's got a great fucking point.  If you learned anything on this program today, it's from Jimmy right there.  You know, you make a good point.  Try getting ahead as an angel.  That just doesn't work.  This is hell.  Is it? 
[03:17:00]  How about the fucking blowjob?  It's readily available.  If it was hell, every time you took your cock out, a girl would go to suck it and the  next thing you know, you'd have your half a torso and shoulder in a shark's mouth.  In a shark's mouth, gouging it in his eye, trying to fucking swim to the surface.  Goddamn brave Australian.  Bastard.  All right.  A little David's background.  Howl's in my seat.  Had holes in it from the teeth.  Shat teeth.  Stop.  Look for my knife.  I saw some more abalone.  It's abalone.  I was looking forward to this all year. 
[03:17:30]  It's great.  Figured I was down there, fixed the engine on the boat.  Fuck it.  Fucking cunt shack.  Let's see what David is trying to say in this clip, because it's all about David's background.  Figure it out.  You've never heard a speaker like David Ring.  Yes, we have.  Born with cerebral palsy, orphaned at an early age, passed about from family to family, yet 
[03:18:00]  he emerged not victimized, but victorious.  Oh.  We throw away broken things, don't we?  But God don't.  God use broken people.  Yeah, you dig that?  I am rich.  It's a good thing.  I am strong.  You can play it to that.  What? 
[03:18:30]  What did he say?  Anyone?  God doesn't make broken things?  I think.  I don't know.  Really?  I'm pulling shit out of my ass here.  Maybe you should look in the mirror.  You don't make broken things, except spines and certain brain fluids.  What the hell did he say?  I don't know.  All right.  Another clip of David.  Yeah.  Even Danny at this point gave up.  Ah, it's just another clip.  I don't know what he's saying.  Usually they help us out and describe the clips for us.  Danny.  Ah, another clip of David.  Not a clue. 
[03:19:00]  No clue.  Just play it and laugh.  Now, some of you look at me over.  You look at me on one side and down the other.  That's okay.  I'm looking you over, too.  You'd say, well, I don't think I'm going to like you.  Well, you don't have any options.  Because the Lord Jesus said to love one another.  Amen? 
[03:19:30]  Amen.  Amen.  Bad news.  Oh, she can't.  I'll call as soon as I can.  They yelled at me.  Of course.  Because I know her, and she probably tried to make a Bluetooth call in open court.  Yeah.  They really frown on phones in the courtroom.  Can't get enough of her.  I miss her.  I miss her being around.  Contempt.  30 days.  Well, she got hit by a car, so she's...  What?  She'd gotten hit by a car. 
[03:20:00]  Of course she has.  Yeah, she was crossing, so she was, like, having some brain trouble recently.  She was worried.  But she's fine now.  When did she get hit by a car?  I don't know.  She told me after it happened.  I talked to her when I was in L.A.  Jesus Christ.  She's always got something going on.  Oh, God, yeah.  Then there was the motorcycle accident where she wiped out in a foreign country on a motorcycle.  She had a fucking Porsche accident with Denzel Washington.  I'm like, are you banging him?  Dude, they're friends.  Like, she knows him.  She's like, no.  He's friends.  I...  I...  What was the story about her going overseas with the boyfriend and hookers and... 
[03:20:30]  Oh, I don't even know.  Helicopter rides and...  I don't remember.  I mean, if she told it, I'm sure she'll tell it again.  I don't remember.  All of her stories always match up.  People think she's bullshitting, but she'll tell you the same thing five years later.  I mean, it's like, yeah, she doesn't...  All right.  She's silly.  David talks about being the youngest child.  Ooh.  I'm the baby of the family.  Baby.  I'm the baby of eight.  And when I came along, they'd spoil me what?  Nah.  I'm the baby, but I'd spoil what? 
[03:21:00]  By the way, he's the baby.  Because after that thing popped out, fucking...  The husband took his Doc Martin and gave her a kick right in the tubes.  They never fucked again after they saw him.  Here's Neil in Nashville.  Neil's got it.  Go ahead, Neil.  Yeah, it sounds like this guy's playing a never-ending game of Chubby Bunny.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  If you didn't do that dog thing or anything, spit out the marshmallows, guys. 
[03:21:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Oh, my God.  We didn't fucking weigh E-Rock, speaking of.  Every Thursday.  Get that fat shit in here.  Because I think he might have slacked off.  Yes, he did.  All right, let's get through this.  I think he slacked off because he was doing well.  I knew there was something we had to accomplish today.  Let's accomplish one lousy thing on this show today.  All right, David talks about being the youngest child.  I'm a Wadden.  I'm another boy, Wadden, brat. 
[03:22:00]  And I love every minute of it.  The Bible says that I was wonderfully and fearfully made by God.  Wonderfully and fearfully made by God.  Okay, terrific.  There's got to be a fear involved there.  There's a lot of fear in the religion.  All right.  And finally, David, this clip is just labeled, I have no idea what this chant is. 
[03:22:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I am Paul R. Nelson.  Don't forget my all is all.  I have cerebral palsy.  Now, what's your problem?  Oh, I have cerebral palsy.  And now, what's your problem?  That I understood what you were talking about?  All right. 
[03:23:00]  That I have to sit and watch you?  Poor fella.  Exactly.  Poor guy.  Is he wheelchair bound?  No?  So he was standing, huh?  Was he just shaking all over the place and kind of almost falling?  I haven't seen the guy in my neighborhood lately.  I want to get a videotape of this guy.  Business suit.  Okay, I'll bring my camera.  Dressed to the nines.  Briefcase.  And I used to watch him attempt to walk a block.  It was tiring for everybody watching. 
[03:23:30]  Just take forever.  Dude, the shaking and the flailing and dropping of the briefcase, the picking up of the briefcase.  It drops again.  You ought to lock it there with handcuffs like it's top secret information from the CIA.  Dude, it is hell on earth.  That one is hell on earth.  I'm not bringing this up to laugh at it.  It was so tiring to watch what this guy has to do on a daily basis.  I once watched him.  I once watched how fucking I could have been a model with that line. 
[03:24:00]  It's so tiring to watch this guy.  Well, yeah.  I think I was annoyed because he was tiring me out.  Oh, is that hysterical?  Good point.  Oh, the guy just exhausts me.  I saw him hail a cab one day.  It was one of the most unbelievable things ever.  Planes are landing.  Ever.  Right, ever.  Cars are crashing because they're thinking he's signaling the car to avoid something. 
[03:24:30]  Look out.  There's a part.  What?  I don't know.  When you said I didn't bring him up to laugh at him, I'm like, well, maybe you didn't.  But I feel obligated.  It's totally, yeah.  Do you know what I'd like to do?  I don't want to do anything bad to him.  But I'd like to watch him walk the entire length of the sidewalk.  And then when he gets to where I am, just slap his face.  For no explanation.  Just quietly walk up and give him a good crispy slap across his fucking bed face. 
[03:25:00]  That would be horrible, though.  With the twitches and the face going like this and the arms and the legs all just doing whatever  the hell they want at the same time.  You walk in somewhere like that and then you get to where you're going and you go, did I  turn the oven off?  You've got to like turn back around and take the walk.  Normally for anyone else, you know, you jog back or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, just horror walk.  I wonder whatever happened to that guy.  I haven't seen him in a long time.  I hope he just moved into a fifth floor walk up. 
[03:25:30]  He's dead.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Hmm.  All right.  I got to go.  So I have to fly.  Oh, you didn't pack again, did you?  I have some packed, but not all.  No, you don't.  You're lying.  I do.  What did you pack?  Your toothbrush?  I have my toothbrush and my lubricant.  My brother wants to know why there's no instant feedback link on Foundry anymore.  I have plenty to say about the shark stories.  Of course, my brother, the marine biologist.  Oh, shit. 
[03:26:00]  The responsible one in my family.  Where's Steve?  There's a link there.  You got a link on Foundry, right?  How could you find it?  I mean.  Well, just go to opianandby.com.  I like how scorned he looks when I say that.  Look at how tight those shirt sleeves are.  I know.  Isn't it lovely?  Wow.  It's all very streamlined now.  It's all very streamlined.  Streamlined.  That's what I like to call it.  He's worked hard on it.  It's right there.  Before Jimmy leaves, yeah, it's right up at the top.  We got a wham. 
[03:26:30]  Maybe it needs to be underwater for your brother to see.  But, you know.  Yeah.  Kenny with the casual look.  Casual Kenny.  The Harley Davidson long-sleeve thermal.  And those big pants.  You wear some fucking giant pants.  You're a big guy.  But, like, they're giant.  I saw him before.  He, like, pulled his shirt up.  I saw that, too.  So his tummy was showing.  And then he pulled his pants up to his nipples.  Kenny's the last guy that pulls his jeans up past his belly button. 
[03:27:00]  It's awful.  I don't know why.  Pull him up real high.  And you're wearing a belt, right?  Yeah.  And you're still, like, pulling your pants up?  I thought a belt is supposed to hold your pants where you put them.  No, they, like, are hip huggers.  These are like Calvin Klein jeans.  I don't understand.  Here, pull your pants up again for everybody.  It's really.  He wears them really high.  Look, watch.  Look how high up his pants.  No one wears them that high.  I swear to God, it's past his belly button. 
[03:27:30]  That's what he does.  Gives them the tug.  He likes the feeling of the seam just mushing his fucking ball vein up.  His ball vein.  We missed another great line.  Thank you, Phil in Chicago, the evangelist.  This guy should be in the movie.  My baby is black.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Very good. 
[03:28:00]  That's why we love you fuckers.  All right.  Wait, E-Rock, if you've got to leave, Jimmy, you've got to leave.  But I do want to see him get weighed if we can.  Oh, very good.  I have to.  Any money on the line this week?  It should be pretty fast.  All right, the story goes, E-Rock gained 21 pounds over the holidays.  We all noticed and started pointing and laughing at him.  Mm-hmm.  You were up to how much?  200?  219.  219.  But he did admit it was 21 pounds he gained.  Yeah.  And last we weighed you, 214.  You look like you lost a little bit. 
[03:28:30]  Although that neck, I still want to throw a fish at your mouth.  No, nah.  The motivation's over.  Maybe you're right.  He gained a pound.  I hope you're right.  Pelican.  The motivation has ended.  Look at that pelican.  He went two weeks, like, trying, but now it's like, nah.  Pelican.  Fly.  It's kind of good.  It's kind of good.  Trying to get the suds off his arm and use the remote.  Fucking some dude from his cell phone. 
[03:29:00]  Ken is wearing mom jeans.  Yeah, you are.  You're wearing, like, fucking soccer mom jeans.  That's Chris from his cell phone.  A pair of sportabouts.  Sportabouts.  And he's unshaven today.  That scares us all.  Yeah.  Because you're usually well kept.  I'll do better.  You're casual.  It's a travel day.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  It's fine.  You've got to take two planes.  Two?  Yeah.  You've got to go through Houston.  A lot of people don't know that.  All right.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:29:30]  Let's weigh, uh...  It's horrible.  Why run on that scale?  So here he goes.  You were down to 214?  I'm saying right now, as I look at you, I'm saying 216.5.  Yeah, the motivation ended.  Please.  And you know what you have to do if you gain weight, right?  Blow all of us.  He has to do Chubby Bunny again.  Oh, fuck.  You know, Mancow's going to be very upset.  He's going to get his, uh...  This is very irresponsible.  What is it called?  The Foundation for Responsible Radio. 
[03:30:00]  Foundation for Responsible Radio.  He's going to get after us.  All right.  Go ahead.  Nice shoes.  Oh, boy.  That means he's lost more weight.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hang on.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  Get back in.  213.8.  What?  No.  2.8.  Oh, look at it.  You're all mad. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  What?  You called me fat.  He gained a pound?  What does that say?  What does that say?  It's tons.  Now it's 214.  213.8.  Fucking asshole.  What?  It's going between, like, 0.6 and 0.8.  So I like how Sam just rounds up.  This is the easiest fucking thing to do.  We're weighing somebody.  What's the weight?  213.8.  0.7.  How about 0.6, 0.8, 0.7?  So you lost, like, a...  A third of a pound.  You lost nothing.  You lost a teaspoon of shit out of your body. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, a healthy dump, and you fucking lose more than that.  Yeah, this morning he was straining really hard to fucking shitting on the scale.  Right.  Pop out that last bloop.  Oh.  Ah, fuck.  A hard potential cancer shit.  Step on a scale.  Dude, you couldn't take one for the team and just turn into a fat fuck for a month so he  could laugh at you a little bit?  Dude, in two weeks...  What the hell's wrong with you?  He lost a third of a pound.  A third of a pound.  At this rate, he'll be fucking fat until 2074. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  Well, Jimmy, have fun in Sacramento.  Yeah, Jim.  The punchline.  Godspeed.  Have fun.  Yeah.  How long's your layover?  An hour.  70 minutes.  Go ahead.  Familiate me.  Don't be a liar.  Kenny, what do you do on these long flights?  I try to sleep.  He does sleep.  It's really comfortable looking.  Oh, my God.  I've seen it. 
[03:32:00]  Dude, I got pictures of it.  I snapped pictures of you because you flew in first class with us last trip.  And I got pictures of him sleeping.  I got to post them.  It is frightening.  Why is it frightening?  Just because his mouth...  Because his head is so far back.  He's such a big guy that his head goes above the headrest in the seat.  So when he tries to lean his head back, it doesn't, like, go into the nice little headrest.  It's above it.  So his head is snapped back like fucking Saddam Hussein's in the blanket after the hanging. 
[03:32:30]  It's fucking just...  And his mouth is open.  And he's just gurgling.  I've never seen anyone actually look dumb in slumber.  It's like...  He looks like an idiot.  He's trying to eat the roof of the plane.  Fucking mouth open.  Gasping for breath.  He's just...  It's a strategy.  He's hoping, just in case he sleeps through cabin decompression, the air mask will fall right on his mouth. 
[03:33:00]  And he'll be fine.  Jesus.  All right, guys.  All right.  I will see you guys...  I'll see you Tuesday because I'm doing Sunday, so we fly home Monday.  Oh.  So I'll see you Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  All right.  Bye, boys.  You're looking sporty with your headband and your sunglasses.  Digging the look.  See you soon, dude.  Your little fuzzy head.  Bye, Kenny.  Break a leg there, Jimmy.  Bye, sweetie.  Not literally.  That means do good with your comedy act.  You're staying here, Kenny?  There he goes. 
[03:33:30]  He's taking a cab home.  Um...  Oh.  He gets, like, nervous when I wait outside his apartment.  Why?  I don't know.  Jimmy's a private guy in his apartment.  He doesn't want you sitting out there while he's, like, jacking off.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, you're out there, he's jerking off, and all he can think of is you sitting out in the car.  Can't blame him.  He really does.  He can't blame him.  Doesn't really conjure up any good fantasies.  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Um...  Yeah, it's Voss tomorrow.  People are asking.  Oh, did you hear that?  I did.  What?  That collective...  Oh, fuck.  Well...  Oh.  Well, I've been putting off errands for about a week and a half.  I guess tomorrow's the day I do them.  Heard an entire country go, oh, no.  Let's go into it with an open mind.  Please.  I can't get enough of Voss, actually.  Yeah, Voss is a good guest.  He always opens up, that's for sure. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  He's got plenty of horrid stories of his younger days.  All right, let's do line of the day and get the hell out of here.  Line of the day.  What do we got there, Than?  Bodogfight.com, I know that much.  Yeah.  Kenny, what do you know about Bodogfight.com?  B-O-D-O-G-Fight.com.  I know you go on the internet and they're terrific.  Why are they terrific, though?  That's great.  Because they're a sponsor of this show and they have to be terrific because this is a  terrific show. 
[03:35:00]  Do you know what they do?  Yeah, they got a www.bodog.com.  Fight.com.  Oh, my God.  All right, let me put that in.  Bodog.com.  You've been fighting an organization since coming up at Error.  Bodogfight.com.  Why should the listeners go there?  Because you said so.  Oh, yeah.  That makes people jump.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  All right.  One runner-up?  One runner-up. 
[03:35:30]  So we got today's runner-up, line of the day.  I learned that that whore who was skydiving and the goat had something in common.  They were both asking for it.  That's what you learned today, John.  Very good.  You're minding your business.  You take a Viagra, you hear that goat bell tinkling.  You got holes to do.  I thought the caller was going to get a rare line of the day or runner-up line of the day,  but it was Jimmy once again.  Old Jimmy.  Callers barely got him.  Let's go with today's line of the day thanks to bodogfight.com. 
[03:36:00]  They do some of that ultimate fighting stuff.  Oh, I love that.  Yeah.  That's why I asked you.  Yeah.  And Hot Ring Girls, I'm looking at.  We're on the website now, and they're doing something with Russia.  There's no Russia anymore, though.  Yeah, there's a Russia.  Not really.  It's not the Soviet Union.  There's a Russia.  It's still officially Russia?  Yeah, they're all small and lonely now, because all the other countries are by themselves.  They're not doing big conglomerate. 
[03:36:30]  It's like if, like, Texas.  Yeah.  Like, if the United States busted up, and Texas or Alaska would be, like, take the United States  name.  You know?  Okay.  They would take the name America.  So there's Russia.  So there's Russia, which was like the head muckety-muck of the Soviet Union.  But then there's other countries that were part of the old Russia that aren't part of  the new Russia?  No.  New Russia is just Russia.  There was Russia, and then there were the Soviet-like bloc countries that they had to 
[03:37:00]  listen to Russia.  Right, right.  Now they don't have to listen.  Yeah, that was a union.  The Soviet Union.  Right.  Right.  Hey, let's say hi to the, let's say hi to Don the Trucker.  Don?  Hey, Don.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Today I learned that there's no blowjobs in hell.  I'm glad somebody took that away from the show.  I dare you to try to get a blowjob from an angel.  Just, just let that thought sit there all day.  Or, or the, the devil.  It just doesn't happen in hell.  This can't be, that's why this cannot be hell. 
[03:37:30]  Because the blowjob exists.  This couldn't happen in, in hell.  Here's today's line of the day.  Pitchfork into your taint right in the middle of it.  You're going, I can't be in hell, I'm getting a blowjob.  Oh!  Yeah, they would fucking be a buzzkill with that, wouldn't they?  Here is today's line of the day.  Here, here, here, comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of  the day.  I no longer need this. 
[03:38:00]  What?  You took off a prosthetic leg?  Late at night when all the world.  Plop a side of the leg with a turkey sandwich in his mouth.  You know what I thought should have won line of the day today?  When we're doing the John and Jeff thing and he goes, and I like...  And then you hit the bleep perfectly?  That was really funny.  Oh, the bleep. 
[03:38:30]  The bleep.  Ant, you're wrong.  Google Russia?  What happens when you Google Russia?  You get, like, fucking ads for Russian chicks?  Yes, Dan?  I was just, in the interest of fair play, a listener...  Please?  ...unfortunately just missed the time cutoff.  The guy that said the CP preacher sounded like he had a mouthful of chubby, you know,  was doing chubby bun.  Yeah.  He would have made honorable mention had we had enough time.  All right.  Okay.  So that's good.  That's good for the listeners.  So, like, they continue to try. 
[03:39:00]  Yes.  If he would have made the cutoff, he would have got a runner-up line of the day.  That's pretty cool.  All right.  We're out of here.  Bye.  Obi and Anthony, it's like radio on steroids.  With extra small testicles, I have little balls.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
